His collaborator in the volume has himself passed\r\nthrough a state of profound suspended animation from drowning, having\r\nbeen laid out for dead--an experience which has induced him in like\r\nmanner to investigate the various death-counterfeits. The results of\r\nthe independent inquiries carried on by both of us in various parts\r\nof Europe and America, and by one of us during a sojourn in India in\r\nthe early part of this year, are now laid before the reader, with such\r\npractical suggestions as it is hoped may prepare the way for bringing\r\nabout certain needed reforms in our burial customs.\r\n\r\nThe danger, as I have attempted to show, is very real--to ourselves,\r\nto those most dear to us, and to the community in general; and it\r\nshould be a subject of very anxious concern how this danger may\r\nbe minimised or altogether prevented. The duty of taking the most\r\neffective precautions to this end is one that naturally falls to the\r\nLegislature, especially under a Government professing to regard social\r\nquestions as of paramount importance. Fortunately, this is a non-party\r\nand a non-contentious question, it imperils no interest, so that no\r\nformal obstruction or unnecessary delay need be apprehended; and it\r\nshould be urged upon the Government to introduce and carry an effective\r\nmeasure at the earliest opportunity, not only as a security against the\r\npossibility of so terrible an evil, but to quiet the widespread and not\r\naltogether unreasonable apprehension on this subject which is now so\r\nprevalent.\r\n\r\nIt has been found convenient to retain throughout the body of the work\r\nthe use of the singular pronoun, but every part of the book receives\r\nthe cordial approval of both authors, and with this explanation we\r\naccept its responsibility jointly.\r\n\r\nWe have to acknowledge our great indebtedness in preparing this volume\r\nto many previous writers, including such as have investigated the\r\nphenomena of suspended animation and the signs of death, and such\r\nas, with a more practical intention, have dwelt upon the danger of\r\ndeath-counterfeits being mistaken for the absolute extinction of life,\r\nillustrating their counsels or warnings by numerous instances. Grouping\r\nboth classes of writers together, we may mention specially the names of\r\nWinslow and Bruhier, Hufeland, Struve, Marcus Herz and Köppen, Kite,\r\nCurry, and Anthony Fothergill; and, of more recent date, the names\r\nof Bouchut, Londe, Lénormand, and Gaubert (on mortuaries), Russell\r\nFletcher, Franz Hartmann, and Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson.\r\n\r\nA work to which we are particularly indebted for the literature of\r\nthe subject is that of the late Dr. Félix Gannal, “Mort Apparente\r\net Mort Réelle: moyens de les distinguer.” Paris, 1890. Dr. Gannal,\r\nhaving qualified in medicine and pharmacy, occupied himself with the\r\nbusiness of embalming, which he inherited from his father. He employed\r\nthe considerable leisure which the practice of that art left to him in\r\ncompiling the above laborious work. He examined many books, pamphlets,\r\ntheses, and articles, from which he cited expressions of opinion on\r\nthe several points--in a lengthy form in his original edition (1868),\r\nin a condensed form in the second edition. His Bibliography is by\r\nfar the most comprehensive that has been hitherto compiled. Our own\r\nBibliography had been put together from various sources before we made\r\nuse of Dr. Gannal’s. It includes several titles which he does not give;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, it has been considerably extended beyond its\r\noriginal limits by transcribing titles which we have found nowhere but\r\nin his list. The Bibliography, it need hardly be said, is much more\r\nextensive than our own reading; but it seemed useful to make it as\r\ncomplete as possible, whether the books had been seen by us or not, so\r\nas to show in chronological order how much interest had been aroused in\r\nthe subject from time to time--in one country more than another, or in\r\nvarious countries together. The titles of articles in journals, which\r\nbelong for the most part to the more recent period, have been taken\r\nfrom the Index Catalogue of the Surgeon-General’s Library, Washington,\r\na few references being added to articles which have otherwise come\r\nunder our notice.\r\n\r\n  W.

The\r\nsection upon “Real and Apparent Death” in the 1868 edition of the\r\nlate Professor Guy’s _Forensic Medicine_ begins with the words, “This\r\nsubject has never attracted much attention in England, and no medical\r\nauthor of repute has treated it at any length”--a remark not less true\r\nafter the lapse of a generation. The following chapters have been\r\nprepared with the view, not so much of supplying this omission, as of\r\nguiding the public to the dangers of our present mode of treating the\r\napparent dead, in the hope that reforms and preventive measures may be\r\ninstituted without delay in order to put an end to such unnecessary\r\ndomestic tragedies.\r\n\r\nIn introducing the subject the author is aware that the great majority\r\nof the medical profession in this country are either sceptical or\r\napathetic as to the alleged danger of living burial. Many do not\r\nbelieve in the existence of death-trance or death-counterfeits, and the\r\nmajority of those who do believe in them declare that cases are very\r\nrare, and that if consciousness is ever restored in the grave it can\r\nonly last a second or two, and that those who live in fear of such an\r\noccurrence should provide for a _post-mortem_ or for the severance of\r\nthe jugular vein. Many persons, on the other hand, after much careful\r\ninquiry, are of opinion that cases of premature burial are of frequent\r\noccurrence; and that the great majority of the human race (outside of\r\na few places in Germany, where waiting mortuaries are established, or\r\nwhere the police regulations, such as those described in this volume as\r\nexisting in Würtemburg, are efficiently and systematically carried out)\r\nare liable to this catastrophe. Important as the subject is allowed to\r\nbe, and numerous as are the reported cases, no effective steps, either\r\npublic or private, appear to have been taken, outside of Germany and\r\nAustria, to remedy the evil. At present a majority of the people appear\r\ncontent to trust to the judgment of their relations and to the ordinary\r\ncertificates of death to safeguard them from so terrible a disaster.\r\nThat death-certificates and death-verifications are often of a most\r\nperfunctory description, both as to the fact of death and the cause\r\nof death, has been proved by overwhelming evidence before the recent\r\nHouse of Commons Committee on Death-Certification. Such certificates,\r\nwhen obtained, may be misleading and untrustworthy; while in many\r\ncases burials take place without the doctor having either attended\r\nthe patient or examined the body. Nor, in spite of the appointment\r\nof death-verificators by our neighbours across the Channel, is this\r\nimportant precaution effectively carried out by them. M. Devergie\r\nreports that in twenty-five thousand communes in France no verification\r\nof death takes place, although the law requires it; and he demands\r\nthat no diploma shall be given without the candidate having proved\r\nhimself conversant with the signs of death. (_Medical Times_, London,\r\n1874, vol. i., p. 25.) On personal inquiry from medical authorities in\r\nFrance, during the present year (1896), we learn that this laxity still\r\nprevails.\r\n\r\nIt appears strange that, except when a man dies, all his concerns are\r\nprotected by custom and formalities, or guarded by laws, so as to\r\ninsure his interests being fairly carried out to completion. Thus we\r\nsee that heirship, marriage, business affairs of all kinds, whether of\r\na public or private nature, are amply guarded by such precautionary\r\nand authoritative measures as will secure them. But one of the most\r\nimportant of all human interests--that which relates to the termination\r\nof life--is managed in such a careless and perfunctory way as to permit\r\nof irreparable mistakes. To be sure there are laws in most of the\r\nContinental States of Europe that are intended to regulate the care and\r\nburial of the dead, but few of them make it certain that the apparently\r\ndead shall not be mistaken for the really dead, and treated as such.\r\nNone of them allow more than seventy-two hours before burial (some\r\nallow only thirty-six, others twenty-four, and others again much less,\r\naccording to the nature of the disease), unless the attending physician\r\npetitions the authorities for reasonable delay--a rare occurrence.\r\nAnd even if postponement is granted, it is doubtful if the inevitable\r\nadministrative formalities would leave opportunities for dubious cases\r\nto receive timely and necessary attention, or for cases of trance,\r\ncatalepsy, coma, or the like, to be rescued from a living burial.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to a Treatise entitled “The Uncertainty of the\r\nSigns of Death, and the Danger of Precipitate Interments,” published in\r\n1746, the author, Mr. M. Cooper, surgeon, says:--“Though death at some\r\ntime or other is the necessary and unavoidable portion of human nature,\r\nyet it is not always certain that persons taken for dead are really and\r\nirretrievably deprived of life, since it is evident from experience\r\nthat many apparently dead have afterwards proved themselves alive by\r\nrising from their shrouds, their coffins, and even from their graves.\r\nIt is equally certain that some persons, too soon interred after their\r\nsupposed decease, have in their graves fallen victims to a death which\r\nmight otherwise have been prevented, but which they then find more\r\ncruel than that procured by the rope or the rack.” The author quotes\r\nLancisi, first physician to Pope Clement XI., who, in his Treatise _De\r\nsubitaneis mortibus_, observes:--“Histories and relations are not the\r\nonly proofs which convince me that many persons supposed to be dead\r\nhave shown themselves alive, even when they were ready to be buried,\r\nsince I am induced to such a belief from what I myself have seen; for\r\nI saw a person of distinction, now alive, recover sensation and motion\r\nwhen the priest was performing the funeral service over him in church.”\r\n\r\nAfter reporting and describing a large number of cases of premature\r\nburial, or of narrow escapes from such terrible occurrences, in which\r\nthe victims of hasty diagnosis were prepared for burial, or revived\r\nduring the progress of the burial service, Mr. Cooper continues:--“Now,\r\nif a multiplicity of instances evince that many have the good fortune\r\nto escape being interred alive, it is justly to be suspected that\r\na far greater number have fallen victims to a fatal confinement in\r\ntheir graves. But because human nature is such a slave to prejudice,\r\nand so tied down by the fetters of custom, it is highly difficult, if\r\nnot absolutely impossible, to put people on their guard against such\r\nterrible accidents, or to persuade those vested with authority to take\r\nproper measures for preventing them.”\r\n\r\nNothing seems to have been done to remedy this serious evil; and\r\nforty-two years later Mr. Chas. Kite, a well-known practitioner, called\r\nattention to the subject in a volume, entitled “The Recovery of the\r\nApparently Dead,” London, 1788. This author, on p. 92, says:--“Many,\r\nvarious, and even opposite appearances have been supposed to indicate\r\nthe total extinction of life. Formerly, a stoppage of the pulse and\r\nrespiration were thought to be unequivocal signs of death; particular\r\nattention in examining the state of the heart and larger arteries, the\r\nflame of a taper, a lock of wool, or a mirror applied to the mouth or\r\nnostrils, were conceived sufficient to ascertain these points; _and\r\ngreat has been the number of those who have fallen untimely victims\r\nto this erroneous opinion_. Some have formed their prognostic from\r\nthe livid, black, and cadaverous countenance; others from the heavy,\r\ndull, fixed, or flaccid state of the eyes; from the dilated pupil;\r\nthe foaming at the mouth and nostrils, the rigid and inflexible state\r\nof the body, jaws, or extremities; the intense and universal cold,\r\netc. Some, conceiving any one of these symptoms as incompetent and\r\ninadequate to the purpose, have required the presence of such of them\r\nas were, in their opinion, the least liable to error; but whoever will\r\ntake the trouble of reading the Reports of the (Humane) Society with\r\nattention, will meet with very many instances where all the appearances\r\nseparately, and even where several associated in the same case,\r\noccurred, and yet the patient recovered; and it is therefore evident\r\nthat these signs will not afford certain and unexceptionable criteria\r\nby which we may distinguish between life and death.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kite furnishes references to numerous cases of recovery where the\r\napparently dead exhibited black, livid, or cadaverous countenances;\r\neyes fixed or obscure; eyeballs diminished in size, immovable and\r\nfixed in their sockets, the cornea without lustre; eyes shrivelled;\r\nfroth at the mouth; rigidity of the body, jaws, and extremities;\r\npartial or universal cold.[1]\r\n\r\nThe crux of the whole question is the uncertainty of the signs which\r\nannounce the cessation of physical existence. Prizes have been offered,\r\nand prizes have been awarded, but further experience has shown that the\r\nsigns and tests, sometimes singly and sometimes in combination, have\r\nbeen untrustworthy, and that the only certain and unfailing sign of\r\ndeath is decomposition.\r\n\r\nCommenting upon actual cases of premature burial, the _Lancet_, March\r\n17, 1866, p. 295, says:--“Truly there is something about the very\r\nnotion of such a fate calculated to make one shudder, and to send a\r\ncold stream down one’s spine. By such a catastrophe is not meant the\r\nsudden avalanche of earth, bricks, or stones upon the luckless miner or\r\nexcavator, or the crushing, suffocative death from tumbling ruins. No;\r\nit is the cool, determined treatment of a living being as if he were\r\ndead--the rolling him in his winding sheet, the screwing him down in\r\nhis coffin, the weeping at his funeral, and the final lowering of him\r\ninto the narrow grave, and piling upon his dark and box-like dungeon\r\nloads of his mother earth. The last footfall departs from the solitary\r\nchurch-yard, leaving the entranced sleeper behind in his hideous shell\r\nsoon to awaken to consciousness and to a benumbed half-suffocated\r\nexistence for a few minutes; or else, more horrible still, there he\r\nlies beneath the ground conscious of what has been and still is,\r\nuntil, by some fearful agonised struggle of the inner man at the weird\r\nphantasmagoria which has passed across his mental vision, he awakes to\r\na bodily vivification as desperate in its torment for a brief period as\r\nhas been that of his physical activity. But it is soon past. There is\r\nscarcely room to turn over in the wooden chamber; and what can avail a\r\nfew shrieks and struggles of a half-stifled, cramped-up man!”\r\n\r\nTo prevent such unspeakable horrors as are here pictured, the Egyptians\r\nkept the bodies of the dead under careful supervision by the priests\r\nuntil satisfied that life was extinct, previous to embalming them\r\nby means of antiseptics, balsams, and odoriferous gums. The Greeks\r\nwere aware of the dangers of premature burial, and cut off fingers\r\nbefore cremation to see whether life was extinct. In ancient Rome the\r\nrecurrence of cases of premature burial had impressed the nation with\r\nthe necessity for exercising the greatest caution in the treatment of\r\nthe supposed dead; hasty conclusions were looked upon as criminal, the\r\nabsence of breath or heat or a cadaverous appearance were regarded\r\nas uncertain tests, and the supposed dead were put into warm baths\r\nor washed with hot water, and other means of restoration adopted.\r\nNeither in the greater part of Europe nor in the United States are\r\nany such means resorted to now, except in the case of apparent death\r\nby drowning, by asphyxia, or by hanging. Premature burials and narrow\r\nescapes are of almost every-day occurrence, as the narratives in the\r\nnewspapers testify; and the complaint made by a surgeon, Mr. Cooper,\r\na hundred and fifty years ago, that the evil is perpetuated because\r\nwe are slaves to prejudice, and because those vested with authority\r\nrefuse to take measures for prevention, remains a serious blot upon our\r\nadvanced civilisation. The _Spectator_, September 14, 1895, commenting\r\nupon this unsatisfactory state of affairs, observes:--“Burning,\r\ndrowning, even the most hideous mutilation under a railway train, is\r\nas nothing compared with burial alive. Strangely enough this universal\r\nhorror seems to have produced no desire to guard against burial alive.\r\nWe all fear it, and yet practically no one takes any trouble to avoid\r\nthe risk of it happening in his own case, or in that of the rest of\r\nmankind. It would be the simplest thing in the world to take away all\r\nchance of burying alive; and yet the world remains indifferent, and\r\nenjoys its horror undisturbed by the hope of remedy.”\r\n\r\nThe authors’ own reasonings, opinions, and conclusions are here\r\nbriefly presented; but as the majority of the public are more or less\r\ninfluenced by authority, it has been thought advisable to furnish a\r\nseries of authenticated facts under the several headings to which they\r\nbelong, and to cite the judgments of eminent members of the medical\r\nprofession who have given special attention to the subject. The source\r\nof difficulty has been an _embarras de richesse_, or how from a mass\r\nof material, the extent of which will be seen by reference to the\r\nBibliography, to select typical cases without needless repetition.\r\nThe premature burials and narrow escapes from such disasters, which\r\nare reported by distinguished physicians and reputable writers, may\r\nbe numbered literally by hundreds, and for every one reported it is\r\nobvious from the nature of the case that many are never heard of.\r\nAmongst the names of notable persons who have thought the subject\r\nsufficiently practical for their attention may be mentioned those of\r\nEmpedocles, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Pliny, Celsus, Plutarch, and St.\r\nAugustine in antiquity; of Fabricius, Lancisi, Winslow, Haller, Buffon,\r\nLavater, Moses Mendelssohn, Hufeland, and Alexander von Humboldt in\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nThe subject has several times engaged the attention of the French\r\nSenate and Legislative Chamber, as well as the Legislative Assemblies\r\nin the various States of Germany. In 1871, Dr. Alex. Wilder, Prof. of\r\nPhysiology and Psychological Science, read a paper before the members\r\nof both houses of the New York State Legislature at the Capitol,\r\nAlbany; but we are not aware that the subject has ever been introduced\r\nin any of the other State Legislatures, or in the British Parliament,\r\nor in any of the Colonial Assemblies.\r\n\r\nIn an editorial note, as far back as November 27, 1858, the _Lancet_,\r\nreferring to a case of death-trance, remarked that such “examples are\r\nsufficiently mysterious in their character to call for a more careful\r\ninvestigation than it has hitherto been possible to accord to them.”\r\nThe facts disclosed in this treatise, the authors hope, may encourage\r\nqualified scientific observers to study the subject of death-trance,\r\nwhich, it must be admitted, has been strangely overlooked in England,\r\nthough it would not be easy to mention one which more deeply concerns\r\nevery individual born into the world.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent unnecessary pain to the reader on a subject so\r\ndistressing in its nature, the more sensational and horrifying cases\r\nof premature burial have been omitted. They can, however, be found\r\nin abundance in the writings of Bruhier, Köppen, Kempner, Lénormand,\r\nBouchut, Russell Fletcher, and the Boston (U.S.) edition of Hartmann.\r\nIn England and in America it is the fashion amongst medical men to\r\nmaintain that the tests known to medical art are fully equal to the\r\nprevention of live burial, that the cases quoted by the newspapers\r\nare introduced for sensational purposes, and that most of them are\r\napocryphal. The perusal of the cases recorded in this volume, and a\r\ncareful consideration of the weight of cumulative evidence represented\r\nby the very full bibliography, must satisfy the majority of reflective\r\nreaders that the facts are both authentic and numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PREMATURE BURIAL,\r\n                                  AND\r\n                       HOW IT MAY BE PREVENTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _SOME FORMS OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF all the various forms of suspended animation and apparent death,\r\ntrance and catalepsy are the least understood, and most likely to lead\r\nthe subject of them to a premature burial; the laws which control\r\nthem have perplexed pathologists in all ages, and appear to be as\r\ninsoluble as those which govern life itself. Dr. Le Clerc, in his\r\n“History of Medicine,” records that “Heraclides, of Pontus, wrote a\r\nbook _concerning the causes of diseases_, and another _concerning\r\nthe disease in which the patient is without respiration_, in which\r\nhe affirmed that in this disorder the patient sometimes continued\r\nthirty days without respiration, in such wise that he appeared dead,\r\nnotwithstanding that there was no corruption of the body.”[2]\r\n\r\nDr. Herbert Mayo, in “Letters on Truths Contained in Popular\r\nSuperstitions,” p. 34, says that “death-trance is the suspension\r\nof the action of the heart, and of breathing, and of voluntary\r\nmotion--generally little sense of feeling and intelligence. With these\r\nphenomena is joined loss of external warmth, so that the usual evidence\r\nof life is gone. But there has occurred every shade of this condition\r\nthat can be imagined, between occasional slight manifestations of\r\nsuspension of one or other of the vital actions and their entire\r\ndisparition.”\r\n\r\nMacnish, who also asserts that the function of the heart must go on,\r\nand even of the respiration, however slightly, says--“No affection\r\nto which the animal frame is subject is more remarkable than this\r\n(catalepsy, or trance).... There is such an apparent extinction of\r\nevery faculty essential to life, that it is inconceivable how existence\r\nshould go on during the continuance of the fit.”--_Philos. of Sleep,\r\nGlasgow, 1834, pp. 225-6._\r\n\r\nIn Quain’s “Dictionary of Medicine,” ii., p. 1063, Dr. Gowers\r\nsays:--“The state now designated hypnotism is really induced trance,\r\nand trance has been accurately termed ‘spontaneous hypnotism’....\r\n\r\n“The mental functions seem, in most cases, to be in complete abeyance.\r\nNo manifestations of consciousness can be observed, or elicited by the\r\nmost powerful cutaneous stimulation, and on recovery no recollection of\r\nthe state is preserved. But in some cases volition only is lost, and\r\nthe patient is aware of all that passes, although unable to give the\r\nslightest evidence of consciousness....\r\n\r\n“In the cases in which the depression of the vital functions reaches\r\nan extreme degree, the patient appears dead to casual and sometimes to\r\ncareful observation. This condition has been termed ‘death-trance,’\r\nand has furnished the theme for many sensational stories, but\r\nthe most ghastly incidents of fiction have been paralleled by\r\nwell-authenticated facts. [The last clause appears in the new edition\r\nas follows:--“Persons have certainly been buried in this state, and\r\nduring the recent epidemic of influenza an Italian narrowly escaped\r\ninterment during the consequent trance.”]\r\n\r\n“The duration of trance has varied from a few hours or days to several\r\nweeks, months, or even a year.\r\n\r\n“Occasionally it is attended by some vaso-motor disturbance. In a\r\nwell-authenticated case of death-trance the intense mental excitement\r\nproduced by the preparations for fastening the coffin lid occasioned a\r\nsweat to break out over the body.”\r\n\r\n[CASE OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI.]\r\n\r\nMany notable men have at one time or another been subject to this\r\ndisorder. Speaking of Benjamin Disraeli, Mr. J. Fitzgerald Molloy, in\r\nhis “Life of the Gorgeous Lady Blessington,” vol. ii., pp. 37, 38, says\r\nthat in his “youth he was seized with fits of giddiness, during which\r\nthe world swung round him, he became abstracted, and once fell into a\r\ntrance from which he did not recover for a week.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLETHARGIC STUPOR, OR TRANCE.\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_ of December 22, 1883, pp. 1078-80, contains particulars\r\nfrom the pen of W. T. Gairdner, M.D., LL.D., etc., Professor of\r\nMedicine in the University of Glasgow, of a remarkable case of trance,\r\nextending continuously over more than twenty-three weeks, which\r\nattracted a considerable amount of notoriety at the time and led to\r\nan extensive discussion. In his comments upon the case, the author\r\ncontinues, in the issue of January 5, 1884, pp. 5, 6:--\r\n\r\n“The case recorded in the _Lancet_ of December 22, 1883, p. 1078, has\r\nbeen left up to this point without remarks, other than those obviously\r\nsuggested by the direct observation of the facts in comparison or\r\ncontrast with those of other cases coming more or less under the\r\ndesignation above mentioned. But in perusing, even in the most cursory\r\nmanner, the multitudinous literature pertaining to the subjects of\r\n‘trance,’ ‘ecstasy,’ ‘catalepsy,’ etc., not to speak of the popular\r\nnarratives which from a very remote antiquity have handed down the\r\ntradition of preternatural sleep as an element in the fairy tales\r\nof almost all languages, one is struck by the almost uncontrollable\r\ndisposition to regard such cases as altogether outside the limits of\r\ntrue physiological science: as being, according to the expressive\r\nScotch phrase, ‘no canny’--or, in other words, miraculous--and as\r\ninvolving questions connected with the unseen world, ‘the undiscovered\r\ncountry from whose bourn no traveller returns.’ So much is this the\r\ncase, that, if in this nineteenth century the questions which presented\r\nthemselves to Hippocrates in the treatise, _περὶ ἱερῆς νούσου_\r\n(‘Concerning the Sacred Disease’), had to be rediscussed, it would\r\ncertainly be in regard to some of the disorders mentioned above, and\r\nnot as to epilepsy in its well-recognised clinical types, that the\r\ntheory of a supernatural origin of the phenomena, whether favourably\r\nentertained or not, would fall to be argued. The irreconcilable\r\ndifferences of opinion in the Belgium Academy, as regards the quite\r\nmodern instance of Louise Lateau, are sufficient to show that all the\r\nculture and the scientific instincts of the present age have not quite\r\ninaugurated the ‘reign of law,’ nor established finally the position\r\nthat ‘miracles do not happen.’ On the other hand, the researches of\r\nM. Charcot and others seem to be ever extending the domain of science\r\nfurther into the region of the marvellous and the obscure, so that\r\neven the most pronounced cases of ‘demoniac possession’ of the olden\r\ntime have become the commonplaces of hystero-epilepsy in the clinique\r\nof the Salpétrière. The peculiar interest of the present case is that\r\nit is altogether devoid of any of these adventitious, and more or less\r\nromantic, incidents. The patient is the mother of a family, and has\r\nlived a strictly domestic and (up to a short time before her seizure)\r\nhealthy and regular life. There are no peculiar moral and religious\r\nproblems to perplex the situation. There is no history of inveterate\r\nhysteria, or of long continued rapt contemplation; nor has there been\r\nthe slightest evidence of any craving after notoriety, either before\r\nthe attack or since its termination. The moral atmosphere, in short,\r\nsurrounding the phenomena is altogether unfavourable to exaggeration\r\nand imposture, for which, indeed, no reasonable motive can be assigned.\r\nNevertheless, under these very commonplace conditions, concurring\r\nwith some degree of melancholy or mental despondency after delivery,\r\nbut during a convalescence otherwise normal, Mrs. M’I---- presents\r\nto our notice a condition of suspended consciousness and disordered\r\ninnervation in no degree less extreme than the ‘trances’ or cataleptic\r\nattacks which have been recorded as the result of the most aggravated\r\nhysteria, or as the miracles of religious ecstasy and profound mental\r\nemotion. She becomes for the long period of over a hundred and sixty\r\ndays continuously an almost mindless automaton, connected with the\r\nexternal world only through a few insignificant reflexes and through\r\nthe organic functions. She is absolutely passive as regards everything\r\nthat demands spontaneous movement, and betrays almost no sign of\r\nsensation, general or special, when subjected to the severest tests\r\nthat can be applied short of physical injury.”\r\n\r\n[CASE REPORTED BY PROF. W. T. GAIRDNER.]\r\n\r\nIn further notes upon the case, in the _Lancet_ of January 12, 1884, p.\r\n58, Professor Gairdner says:--\r\n\r\n “The only other case to which I desire to make allusion at present\r\n is one in which I am, fortunately, in a position to furnish a\r\n sequel to an incomplete narrative, not without resemblance to the\r\n one lately published in this journal. ‘A Case of Trance’ was the\r\n subject of a paragraph in the _British Medical Journal_ of May 31,\r\n 1879, p. 827, from which it appeared that in the London Hospital a\r\n woman, twenty-seven years of age, was at the time under the care\r\n of Dr. Langdon Down, being of rather small stature and weak mental\r\n capacity, and affected for at least two years with organic disease of\r\n the heart. About three weeks before the date of the report she had\r\n become suddenly somnolent, with most of the peculiarities in her sleep\r\n which have been already alluded to. She was fed partly by nutrient\r\n enemata, and for some days by a tube passed through the nostrils into\r\n the stomach. The resemblance is noted between this case and that of\r\n ‘the famous Welsh fasting girl,’ then attracting much attention in\r\n newspapers and otherwise. There being no further reference to this\r\n case in the journal, I wrote to Dr. Langdon Down, who kindly furnished\r\n me with the following additional particulars, which will, no doubt,\r\n be read even now with interest:--‘My patient, who was in a state of\r\n trance, recovered somewhat suddenly after about four weeks, and left\r\n the hospital. The first indication of returning consciousness was\r\n observed when I was reading to my class at her bedside one of the\r\n numerous letters that I had received entreating me not to have her\r\n buried until something which the writers recommended had been done.\r\n The paragraph of the medical journal got into some Welsh paper, and\r\n then went the round of the provincial press, hence the number of\r\n letters I received. This special one was from an old gentleman of\r\n eighty-four years, who, when he was twenty-four, was thought to be\r\n dead, and whose friends had assembled to follow him to the grave, when\r\n he heard the undertaker say, “Would anyone like to see the corpse\r\n before I screw him down?” The undertaker at the same time moved the\r\n head a little and struck it against the coffin, on which he aroused\r\n and sat up. On reading this aloud a visible smile passed over the face\r\n of my patient, and she returned to obvious consciousness soon after.\r\n She has not come under observation since she left the hospital.’\r\n\r\n“Although this case is probably only one among many, I mention it here\r\nbecause the receipt of the letter just given led me to investigate more\r\nparticularly the state of the hearing in Mrs. M’I.’s case, and also to\r\ntry the experiment of reading aloud Dr. Down’s letter in her presence\r\nand that of the class. I had often remarked to bystanders that,\r\nalthough the subjects of these apparently unconscious states appeared\r\ninaccessible to the ordinary tests of sensibility, it was on record\r\nas regards some, even of those regarded as cases of ‘apparent death,’\r\nthat after recovery they affirm to have heard everything that passed,\r\nalthough unable to lift hand or foot to save themselves from premature\r\nburial. Neither the reading of the letter nor a violent shout into her\r\near produced any visible effects.”\r\n\r\n[DEATH’S COUNTERFEIT.]\r\n\r\nThomas More Madden, M.D., F.R.C.S. (Edin.), in an article on “Death’s\r\nCounterfeit,” in the _Medical Press and Circular_, vol. i., April 27,\r\n1887, pp. 386-8, relates the following case “of so-called hysteric\r\ntrance”:--\r\n\r\n “A young lady, Miss R----, apparently in perfect health, went to her\r\n room after luncheon to make some change in her dress. A few minutes\r\n afterwards she was found lying on her bed in a profound sleep, from\r\n which she could not be awakened. When I first saw her, twenty-four\r\n hours later, she was sleeping tranquilly; the decubitus being dorsal,\r\n respiration scarcely perceptible, pulse seventy, and extremely small;\r\n her face was pallid, lips motionless, and the extremities very cold.\r\n At this moment, so death-like was her aspect, that a casual observer\r\n might have doubted the possibility of the vital spark still lingering\r\n in that apparently inanimate frame, on which no external stimulus\r\n seemed to produce any sensorial impression, with the exception\r\n that the pupils were normal and responded to light. Sinapisms were\r\n applied over the heart and to the legs, where they were left on until\r\n vesication was occasioned without causing any evidence of pain.\r\n Faradisation was also resorted to without effect. In this state she\r\n remained from the evening of December 31 until the afternoon of\r\n January 3, when the pulse became completely imperceptible; the surface\r\n of the body was icy cold, the respiratory movements apparently ceased,\r\n and her condition was to all outward appearance undistinguishable\r\n from death. Under the influence of repeated hypodermic injections of\r\n sulphuric ether and other remedies, however, she rallied somewhat,\r\n and her pulse and temperature improved. But she still slept on until\r\n the morning of the 9th, when she suddenly woke up, and, to the great\r\n astonishment of those about her, called for her clothes, which had\r\n been removed from their ordinary place, and wanted to come down to\r\n breakfast, without the least consciousness of what had occurred. Her\r\n recovery, I may add, was rapid and complete.\r\n\r\n “The next case of lethargy that came under my notice was that of a\r\n boy, who, after an attack of fever, fell into a state of complete\r\n lethargic coma, in which he lay insensible between life and death for\r\n forty-seven days, and ultimately recovered perfectly.\r\n\r\n “In a third instance of the same kind, in a lady under my care, the\r\n patient, after a lethargic sleep of twenty-seven days, recovered\r\n consciousness for a few hours, and then relapsed into her former\r\n comatose condition, in which she died.\r\n\r\n “The fourth case of lethargy which I have seen was, like the first,\r\n a case of trance, which lasted for seventy hours, during which the\r\n flickering vital spark was only preserved from extinction by the\r\n involuntary action of the spinal and nervous centres. In this instance\r\n the patient finally recovered.\r\n\r\n “The fifth and last instance of profound lethargy that has come within\r\n my own observation occurred last autumn in the Mater Misericordiæ\r\n Hospital in a young woman.... In that instance, despite all that\r\n medical skill could suggest or unremitting attention could do, it was\r\n found impossible to arouse the patient from the apparently hysterical\r\n lethargic sleep in which she ultimately sank and died.”\r\n\r\nI have referred to the foregoing cases, occurring in one physician’s\r\nexperience, as disproving the general opinion that lethargy or trance\r\nis so rarely met with as to be of little medical importance. For my own\r\npart, I have no doubt that these conditions are of far more frequent\r\noccurrence than is generally supposed. Moreover, I have had reason to\r\nknow that death is occasionally so exactly thus counterfeited that\r\nthere is good cause for fearing the probability of living interment in\r\nsome cases of hasty burial.\r\n\r\n[DR. MORE MADDEN’S OPINION.]\r\n\r\nReferring to death-trance, Dr. Madden observes, _ib._, p.\r\n388--“Death-trance, or that profound degree of lethargy which closely\r\ncounterfeits death, deserves greater attention than is generally paid\r\nto it as a pathological condition, as well as a possible cause of\r\npremature interment. For, unless we reject every statement, however\r\nwell authenticated, of those who have witnessed such cases, merely\r\nbecause their experience does not tally with our preconceived opinions\r\nand wishes, neither the frequent occurrence of death-trance nor the\r\nfearful results of its non-recognition can be questioned.”\r\n\r\nMr. John Chippendale, F.R.C.S., writing to the _Lancet_, 1889, vol. i.,\r\np. 1173, on “Catalepsy.--Post-mortem Sweating,” says:--\r\n\r\n “I may mention that there is a record of a man who during an illness\r\n was seized with trance, though, as he lay in what Claudio calls ‘cold\r\n abstraction,’ he was aware of all that was passing. At last, as he was\r\n about to be covered in his coffin, his mental condition was such that\r\n he broke into a profuse sweat, which was fortunately perceived, and he\r\n recovered and was able to recount his experiences.”\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the following telegram through Reuter’s Agency\r\nthat trance is occasionally epidemic:--\r\n\r\n [From _Daily Telegraph_, March 17, 1890.]\r\n\r\n “A NEW DISEASE.\r\n\r\n  “Vienna, March 15, 1890.\r\n\r\n “Several cases of a new disease, which originally appeared in\r\n Mantua immediately after the subsidence of the recent influenza\r\n epidemic, and to which the people of that city gave the name of ‘La\r\n nonna’--_Anglice_, ‘Falling asleep’--have occurred in the Comitat of\r\n Pressburg.\r\n\r\n “Persons suffering from this complaint fall into a death-like trance,\r\n lasting about four days, out of which the patient wakes in a state of\r\n intense exhaustion. Recovery is very slow, but, so far, no fatal case\r\n has been reported.”\r\n\r\nA correspondent writing to the _English Mechanic_ September 13, 1895,\r\nsays:--“I know one lady who has been three times prepared for burial,\r\nand very narrowly escaped it on the first occasion.” The author\r\nwrote to the writer for further details, and received a reply, dated\r\nSeptember 19, 1895, from which it appears that the lady had married\r\ninto a political family of considerable note, who would not care to\r\nhave her identity disclosed. My correspondent says:--“ I know that she\r\nlay several days in a state not to be distinguished from death; that\r\nshe was in her coffin, and, I believe, showed signs of life just as the\r\ncoffin was about to be closed. On two subsequent occasions she passed\r\ninto similar trances; but though believed to be dead, and treated as\r\nsuch, the previous experience prevented any idea of burial being\r\nentertained” until clear evidence of dissolution should appear.\r\n\r\nThe _New York Weekly Witness_ of January 15, 1896, reports\r\n\r\n[A SEVEN YEARS’ TRANCE.]\r\n\r\n “A LONG CATALEPTIC SLEEP.\r\n\r\n “Information was received at Milford, Pa., last Friday, that William\r\n Depue, a prominent citizen of Bushkill, Pike County, whose mind for\r\n seven years has been a blank, had suddenly returned to consciousness.\r\n\r\n “Seven years ago, while at work, Mr. Depue became ill. Doctors were\r\n summoned, but they could find no possible ailment. The sick man sank\r\n into a cataleptic sleep, from which medical science could not arouse\r\n him.\r\n\r\n “At no time during the long period did he recognise any one, and food\r\n was given him through a tube inserted in his mouth. He lost no flesh,\r\n and was apparently as healthy as any man. Although the best medical\r\n men in the country were called to his bedside, his case baffled them\r\n all.\r\n\r\n “Upon recovering his senses he set about his usual labours as if he\r\n had been asleep but the ordinary time. He remembers nothing that has\r\n taken place during his seven years’ trance.”\r\n\r\nThe following case appeared in the _Middlesbrough Daily Gazette_,\r\nFebruary 9, 1896, and in a number of English papers:--\r\n\r\n “The young Dutch maiden, Maria Cvetskens, who now lies asleep at\r\n Stevensworth, has beaten the record in the annals of somnolence. At\r\n the beginning of last month she had been asleep for nearly three\r\n hundred days. The doctors, who visit her in great numbers, are agreed\r\n that there is no deception in the case. Her parents are of excellent\r\n repute, and it has never occurred to them to make any financial profit\r\n out of the abnormal state of their daughter. As to the cause of the\r\n prolonged sleep, the doctors differ.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCATALEPSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATALEPSY differs in some of its characteristics from trance, but the\r\none is often mistaken for the other. It is not so much a disease as a\r\nsymptom of certain nervous disorders, and to which women and children\r\nare more particularly liable. Catalepsy can be produced artificially by\r\nhypnotisation. Like trance, it has often been mistaken for death, and\r\nits subjects buried alive.\r\n\r\nDr. Franz Hartmann differentiates the two disorders as follows:--“There\r\nseems hardly any limit to the time during which a person may remain\r\nin a trance; but catalepsy is due to some obstruction in the organic\r\nmechanism of the body, on account of its exhausted nervous power.\r\nIn the last case the activity of life begins again as soon as the\r\nimpediment is removed, or the nervous energy has recuperated its\r\nstrength.”\r\n\r\nDr. Gowers, in Quain’s “Dictionary of Medicine,” ed. 1894, vol. i.,\r\npp. 284-5, describes catalepsy as belonging to both sexes, at all ages\r\nfrom six to sixty. It is a nervous affection, commonly associated\r\nwith distinct evidence of hysteria, but said sometimes to occur as\r\nan early symptom of epilepsy. It is attended commonly with loss of\r\nconsciousness. The limbs remain in the position they occupied at the\r\nonset, as if petrified. The whole or part of the muscles pass into\r\na state of rigidity. In profound conditions sensibility is lost to\r\ntouch, pain, and electricity; and no reflex movements can be induced\r\neven by touching the conjunctiva, a state of mental trance being\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\n[NATURE OF CATALEPSY.]\r\n\r\n_Cassell’s Family Physician_ (by Physicians and Surgeons of the\r\nprincipal London Hospitals) describes this singular affection, as\r\nfollows:--“Catalepsy is one of the strangest diseases possible. It\r\nis of rare occurrence, and some very sceptical people have even\r\ngone so far as to deny its existence. That is all nonsense, for\r\ncatalepsy is just as much a reality as gout or bronchitis. A fit of\r\ncatalepsy--for it is a paroxysmal disease--consists essentially in\r\nthe sudden suspension of thought, feeling, and the power of moving.\r\nThe patient remains in any position in which she--we say she, for it\r\noccurs mostly in women--happens to be at the moment of the seizure, and\r\nwill, moreover, retain any posture in which she may be placed during\r\nthe continuance of the fit. For example, you may stretch out the arms\r\nto their full length, and there they remain stretched out without\r\nshowing the slightest tendency to drop. It does not matter how absurd\r\nor inconvenient or apparently fatiguing the position may be, it is\r\nmaintained until altered by some one or until the fit is over. In these\r\nattacks there are no convulsions, but, on the contrary, the patient\r\nremains perfectly immobile. She is just like a waxen figure, or an\r\ninanimate statue, or a frozen corpse.\r\n\r\n“Cataleptic fits vary very much, not only in their frequency, but in\r\ntheir duration. Sometimes they are very short indeed, lasting only a\r\nfew minutes. In one case, that of a lady, they would sometimes come on\r\nwhen she was reading aloud. She would stop suddenly in the middle of a\r\nsentence, and a peculiar stiffness of the whole body would seize her,\r\nfixing the limbs immovably for several minutes. Then it would pass off,\r\nand the reading would be continued at the very word at which it had\r\nbeen interrupted, the patient being quite unconscious that anything had\r\nhappened. But sometimes fits such as these may last for days and days\r\ntogether, and it seems not improbable that people may have been buried\r\nin this state in mistake for death.”\r\n\r\nThe following case, contributed by Dr. Gooch, will further illustrate\r\nthis malady:--\r\n\r\n “A lady, who laboured habitually under melancholy, a few days after\r\n parturition was seized with catalepsy, and presented the following\r\n appearances:--She was lying in bed motionless and apparently\r\n senseless. It was thought the pupils of her eyes were dilated, and\r\n some apprehensions were entertained of effusion on the brain; but\r\n on examining them closely it was found they readily contracted when\r\n the light fell upon them. The only signs of life were warmth, and a\r\n pulse which was one hundred and twenty, and weak. In attempting to\r\n rouse her from this senseless state, the trunk of the body was lifted\r\n up and placed so far back as to form an obtuse angle with the lower\r\n extremities, and in this posture, with nothing to support her, she\r\n continued sitting for many minutes. One arm was now raised, and then\r\n the other, and in the posture they were placed they remained. It was\r\n a curious sight to see her sitting up staring lifelessly, her arms\r\n outstretched, yet without any visible signs of animation. She was\r\n very thin and pallid, and looked like a corpse that had been propped\r\n up and stiffened in that attitude. She was now taken out of bed and\r\n placed upright, and attempts were made to rouse her by calling loudly\r\n in her ears, but in vain; she stood up, indeed, but as inanimate as a\r\n statue. The slightest push put her off her balance, and she made no\r\n exertion to retain it, and would have fallen had she not been caught.\r\n She went into this state three times; the first lasted fourteen\r\n hours, the second twelve hours, and the third nine hours, with waking\r\n intervals of three days after the first fit, and of one day after\r\n the second; after this time the disease assumed the ordinary form of\r\n melancholia.--_The Science and Practice of Medicine, by Sir W. Aitken,\r\n p. 357._\r\n\r\n[CASES BY DRS. JEBB AND KING CHAMBERS.]\r\n\r\nDr. John Jebb, F.R.S., cited in Reynolds’ “System of Medicine,” vol.\r\nii., pp. 99-102, has recorded the following graphic case:--\r\n\r\n “In the latter end of last year (_viz._, 1781), I was desired to\r\n visit a young lady who, for nine months, had been afflicted with that\r\n singular disorder termed a catalepsy. Although she was prepared for\r\n my visit, she was seized with the disorder as soon as my arrival was\r\n announced. She was employed in netting, and was passing the needle\r\n through the mesh, in which position she immediately became rigid,\r\n exhibiting, in a very pleasing form, a figure of death-like sleep,\r\n beyond the power of art to imitate or the imagination to conceive. Her\r\n forehead was serene, her features perfectly composed. The paleness\r\n of her colour, her breathing at a distance being also scarcely\r\n perceptible, operated in rendering the similitude to marble more exact\r\n and striking. The positions of her fingers, hands, and arms were\r\n altered with difficulty, but they preserved every form of flexure they\r\n acquired: nor were the muscles of the neck exempted from this law, her\r\n head maintaining every situation in which the hand could place it as\r\n firmly as her limbs,” etc.\r\n\r\nDr. King Chambers, after citing the above case in full, continues:--\r\n\r\n “The most common exciting cause of catalepsy seems to be strong mental\r\n emotion. When Covent Garden Theatre was last burnt down, the blaze\r\n flashed in at the uncurtained windows of St. Mary’s Hospital. One of\r\n my patients, a girl of twenty, recovering from low fever, was woke up\r\n by it, and exclaimed that the day of judgment was come. She remained\r\n in an excited state all night, and the next morning grew gradually\r\n stiff, like a corpse, whispering (before she became quite insensible)\r\n that she was dead. If her arm was raised, it remained extended in\r\n the position in which it was placed for several minutes, and then\r\n slowly subsided. The inelastic kind of way in which it retained its\r\n position for a time, and then gradually yielded to the force of\r\n gravity, reminded one more of a wax figure than of the marble to\r\n which Dr. Jebb compares it. A strange effect was produced by opening\r\n the eyelid of one eye; the other eye remained closed, and the raised\r\n lid after a time fell very slowly like the arm. A better superficial\r\n representation of death it is difficult to conceive.... In both these\r\n cases I convinced myself carefully that there was no deception.\r\n\r\n “Other cases are of much longer duration.... The death-like state\r\n may last for days. It may be mistaken for real death, and treated as\r\n such....\r\n\r\n “Any cases of apparent death that did occur (in former days) were\r\n burnt, or buried, or otherwise put out of the way, and were never more\r\n heard of. But after the establishment of Christianity, tenderness,\r\n sometimes excessive, for the remains of departed friends took the\r\n place of the hard, heathen selfishness. The dead were kept closer to\r\n the congregations of the living, as if to represent in material form\r\n the dogma of the Communion of Saints. This led to the discovery that\r\n some persons, indeed some persons of note (amongst others, Duns Scotus\r\n the theologian, at Cologne), had got out of their coffins, and died in\r\n a vain attempt to open the doors of their vaults.”\r\n\r\n[CASES FROM THE MEDICAL JOURNALS.]\r\n\r\nThe author relates several other remarkable cases. Here is one:--\r\n\r\n “I lighted accidently on another case, communicated to the same\r\n scientific body (Acad. Royale des Sciences), by M. Imbert in 1713.\r\n It is that of the driver of the Rouen diligence, aged forty-five,\r\n who fell into a kind of soporific catalepsy on hearing of the sudden\r\n death of a man he had quarrelled with. It appears that ‘M. Burette,\r\n under whose care he was at La Charité, made use of the most powerful\r\n assistances of art--bleeding in the arms, the foot, the neck, emetics,\r\n purgatives, blisters, leeches,’ etc. At last somebody ‘threw him\r\n naked into cold water to surprise him.’ The effect surprised the\r\n doctors as much as the patient. It is related with evident wonder how\r\n that ‘he opened his eyes, looked steadfastly, but did not speak.’ His\r\n wife seems to have been a prudent woman, for a week afterwards she\r\n ‘carried him home, where he is at present: they gave him no medicine;\r\n he speaks sensibly enough, and mends every day.’”\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_, 1870, vol. i., p. 1044, in its Paris correspondence\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n “The following curious case is related as having occurred at Dunkirk,\r\n on April 14, and as ‘showing the utility of catalepsy.’ A young girl\r\n of seventeen years was seized with a violent attack of epilepsy, and\r\n fell, on the above date, into a canal. A boatman immediately jumped\r\n into the water to save her, and brought her to the shore after twenty\r\n minutes. The most singular circumstance connected with the accident is\r\n that, when the young girl was taken out of the water, she presented\r\n all the symptoms of catalepsy. Notwithstanding this long immersion,\r\n she was resuscitated, and nothing afterwards transpired to cause any\r\n anxiety.”\r\n\r\nMr. James Braid, M.R.C.S., in the _Medical Times_, 1850, vol. xxi.,\r\np. 402, narrates a case of a cataleptic woman in the Manchester Royal\r\nInfirmary under the care of Dr. John Mitchell, and writes:--\r\n\r\n “Every variety of contrivance and torture was resorted to by various\r\n parties who saw her, for the purpose of testing the degree of her\r\n insensibility, and for determining whether she might not be an\r\n impostor, but without eliciting the slightest indication of activity\r\n of any of the senses; ... nevertheless she _heard and understood all\r\n that was said and proposed to be done, and suffered the most exquisite\r\n torture from various tests applied to her_!! A fact so important as\r\n this ought to be published in every journal throughout the civilised\r\n world; so that in future professional men might be thereby led to\r\n exercise greater discretion and mercy in their modes of applying tests\r\n to such patients.”\r\n\r\nThe _Somerset County Herald_ (Taunton) of October 12 1895, has the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF TRANCE NEAR WEYMOUTH.\r\n\r\n “The wedding nuptials of a sailor from H.M.S. _Alexandra_ and a young\r\n woman residing at Broadwey, who were recently married, have been\r\n interrupted in a most unusual manner by the newly-made bride falling\r\n into a trance. On the day following the wedding Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer,\r\n for such is the name of the newly-espoused pair, went for a drive, and\r\n on returning in the evening the bride, remarking that she did not feel\r\n very well, went upstairs, and before long was in a sound sleep, which\r\n continued throughout the night and far into the following day. The\r\n relatives of the bride, remembering symptoms which she had previously\r\n developed, then sent for Dr. Pridham, who at once pronounced that\r\n the unfortunate young woman had fallen into a trance. Dr. Colmer, of\r\n Weymouth, was likewise called; but nothing that these two medical\r\n gentlemen could do had the slightest effect in arousing their patient\r\n from the state of lethargy into which she had so suddenly and\r\n unexpectedly relapsed. In this condition she remained for a space of\r\n five days, when she gradually showed signs of returning animation,\r\n and in the course of a few hours regained consciousness, though she\r\n was then in a very exhausted condition. After her awakening the young\r\n woman developed inflammation of the legs, which was regarded as a\r\n very serious condition for her to be in. In an interview on Saturday,\r\n Dr. Pridham described the trance as being exceedingly death-like in\r\n character, and added that, in such trances as the one in question, in\r\n the past people have no doubt been actually buried.”\r\n\r\nA report of this case appears in the _St. James’s Gazette_.\r\n\r\nA less experienced practitioner would probably have made out a death\r\ncertificate, as in numerous similar cases.\r\n\r\nAfter burial we hear no more of them; they may have been buried in\r\na death-like trance, but the medical certificate, no matter how\r\ninconsiderately given, consigns them to perpetual silence beyond appeal\r\nor escape. Family remonstrance is then unavailing, for, except in cases\r\nof strong suspicion of poisoning, no Home Secretary or Coroner would\r\ngrant an order for exhumation.\r\n\r\n[APATHY OF THE PUBLIC.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of trance, catalepsy, and other death counterfeits,\r\nfollowed by hasty burial, has been alluded to by reputable writers from\r\ntime immemorial; and while the veracity of these writers has remained\r\nunchallenged, and their narratives are confirmed by hundreds of cases\r\nof modern experience, the effect on the public mind has been only of a\r\ntransitory character, and nothing has been done either in England or\r\nAmerica to safeguard the people from such dreadful mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nANIMAL AND SO-CALLED HUMAN HIBERNATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE following case of the jerboa, or jumping mouse, recorded last\r\ncentury by Major-General Thomas Davies, F.R.S., in the “Transactions\r\nof the Linnæan Society,”[3] will show how far a torpid mammal may be\r\nremoved from the opportunity of breathing, and how imperceptibly, to\r\nthe eyes of an observer, its torpid life passed into actual death:--\r\n\r\n“With respect to the figure given of it in its dormant state (plate\r\nviii., fig. 6), I have to observe that the specimen was found by some\r\nworkmen in digging the foundation for a summer house in a gentleman’s\r\ngarden, about two miles from Quebec, in the latter end of May, 1787.\r\nIt was discovered enclosed in a ball of clay, about the size of a\r\ncricket ball, nearly an inch in thickness, perfectly smooth within, and\r\nabout twenty inches under ground. The man who first discovered it, not\r\nknowing what it was, struck the ball with his spade, by which means it\r\nwas broken to pieces, or the ball also would have been presented to\r\nme. The drawing will perfectly show how the animal is laid during its\r\ndormant state [a tawny mouse, with long hind legs and long tail, coiled\r\nup into a perfect ovoid, of which the two poles are the crown of the\r\nhead and the rump.] How long it had been under ground it is impossible\r\nto say; but as I never could observe these animals in any parts of\r\nthe country after the beginning of September, I conceive that they\r\nlay themselves up some time in that month, or beginning of October,\r\nwhen the frost becomes sharp; nor did I ever see them again before the\r\nlast week of May, or beginning of June. From their being enveloped in\r\nballs of clay, without any appearance of food, I conceive they sleep\r\nduring the winter, and remain for that time without sustenance. As\r\nsoon as I conveyed this specimen to my house, I deposited it, as it\r\nwas, in a small chip box, in some cotton, waiting with great anxiety\r\nfor its waking; but that not taking place at the season they generally\r\nappear, I kept it until I found it began to smell: I then stuffed it,\r\nand preserved it in its torpid position. I am led to believe its not\r\nrecovering from that state arose from the heat of my room during the\r\ntime it was in the box, a fire having been constantly burning in the\r\nstove, and which in all probability was too great for respiration....”\r\n\r\n[INSTANCES OF ANIMAL HIBERNATION.]\r\n\r\nMr. Braid, after citing facts as to higher animals, proceeds:--“There\r\nare other creatures which have not the power of migrating from climes\r\ntoo intensely hot for the normal exercise of their physical functions,\r\nand the lives of these animals are preserved through a state of torpor\r\nsuperinduced by the want of sufficient moisture, their bodies being\r\ndried up from excessive heat. This is the case with snails, which are\r\nsaid to have been revived by a little cold water being thrown on them,\r\nafter having remained in a dry and torpid state for fifteen years. The\r\n_vibrio tritici_ has also been restored, after perfect torpidity and\r\napparent death for five years and eight months, by merely soaking it\r\nin water. Some small, microscopic animals have been apparently killed\r\nand revived again a dozen times by drying and then applying moisture to\r\nthem. This is remarkably verified in the case of the wheel-animalcule.\r\nAnd Spallanzani states that some animalcules have been recovered by\r\nmoisture after a torpor of twenty-seven years. According to Humboldt,\r\nagain, some large animals are thrown into a similar state from want\r\nof moisture. Such he states to be the case with the alligator and\r\nboa-constrictor during the dry season in the plains of Venezuela, and\r\nwith other animals elsewhere.”--_On Trance and Human Hibernation, p.\r\n47._\r\n\r\nDr. Moore Russell Fletcher, in his treatise on “Suspended Animation,”\r\npp. 7, 8, observes:--“Snakes and toads live for a long time without air\r\nor food. The following experiment was made by a Mr. Tower, of Gardiner\r\n(Maine). An adder, upwards of two feet in length, was got into a glass\r\njar, which was tightly sealed. He was kept there for sixteen months\r\nwithout any apparent change, and when let out, looked as well as when\r\nput in, and crawled away.\r\n\r\n“The common pond trout, when thrown into snow, will soon freeze, remain\r\nso for days, and when put into cold water to remove the frost become\r\nlively as ever.\r\n\r\n“When residing in New Brunswick, in 1842, we went to a lake to secure\r\nsome trout, which were frozen in the snow and kept for use. While there\r\nwe saw men with long wooden tongs catching frost fish from the salt\r\nwater at the entrance of a brook. The fish were thrown upon the ice in\r\ngreat quantities. We had a barrel of them put up with snow and kept\r\nfrozen, and in a cool place. For six or seven weeks they were taken\r\nout and used as wanted, and might be kept frozen for an indefinite\r\ntime, and be alive when thawed in cold water. The two pieces of a fish,\r\ncut in two when frozen, would move and try to swim when thawed in cold\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSO-CALLED HUMAN HIBERNATION.\r\n\r\nDr. George Moore observes that “A state of the body is certainly\r\nsometimes produced (in man) which is nearly analogous to the torpor of\r\nthe lower animals--_a condition utterly inexplicable to any principle\r\ntaught in the schools_. Who, for instance, can inform us how it happens\r\nthat certain fishes may be suddenly frozen in the Polar Sea, and so\r\nremain during the long winter and yet be requickened into full activity\r\nby returning summer?”--_Use of the Body in Relation to the Mind, p. 31._\r\n\r\n[UNCERTAINTY OF DEATH.]\r\n\r\nHufeland, in his “Uncertainty of Death,” 1824, p. 12, observes that\r\nit is easier for mankind to fall into a state of trance than the\r\nlower creatures, on account of their complicated anatomy. It is a\r\ntransitory state between life and death, into which anyone may pass and\r\nreturn from. Trance was common among the Greeks and Romans, who, just\r\nbefore cremation, had the custom of cutting off a finger-joint, most\r\nprobably to discover if there was any trace of life. Death does not\r\ncome suddenly; it is a gradual process from actual life into apparent\r\ndeath, and from that to actual death. It is a mistake to take outward\r\nappearances for inner death.\r\n\r\n“It often happens a person is buried in a trance knowing all the\r\npreparations for the interment, and this affects him so much that it\r\nprolongs the trance by its depressing influence. How long can a man\r\nexist in a state of trance? Is there no sign by which the remaining\r\nspark of life may be recognised? Do no means exist to prevent awakening\r\nin the grave? Nothing can be said as to its duration; but we do know\r\nthat differences in the cause and circumstances will cause a difference\r\nin duration. The amount of strength of the person would have great\r\neffect in this. Weak persons, broken down by excesses, would die sooner\r\nthan the strong. The nature of the disease would make a difference. Old\r\nage is less liable to trance than the young. Long sickness destroys\r\nthe sources of life, and shortens the process of death. Sorrow and\r\ntrouble, and numerous diseases, seem to bring on death; yet ofttimes\r\nthe source of life in them exists to its full extent, and what seems\r\nin them to be death may be only a fainting fit, or cramp, which\r\ntemporarily interrupts the action of life. Women are more liable to\r\ntrance than men: most cases have happened in them. Trance may exist in\r\nthe new-born; give them time, and many of them revive. The smell of the\r\nearth is at times sufficient to wake up a case of trance. Six or seven\r\ndays, or longer, are often required to restore such cases.” (Extracted\r\nfrom pp. 10-24.)\r\n\r\n[SELF-INDUCED HIBERNATION.]\r\n\r\nMr. Chunder Sen, municipal secretary to the Maharajah of Jeypore,\r\nintroduced the author, during his visit to India, March 8, 1896, to\r\na venerable and learned fakir, who was seated on a couch Buddhist\r\nfashion, the feet turned towards the stomach, in the attitude of\r\nmeditation, in a small but comfortable house near the entrance to\r\nthe beautiful public gardens of that city. The fakir possesses the\r\npower of self-induced trance, which really amounts to a suspension of\r\nlife, being indistinguishable from death. In the month of December,\r\n1895, he passed into and remained in this condition for twenty days.\r\nOn several occasions the experiment has been conducted under test\r\nconditions. In 1889, Dr. Hem Chunder Sen, of Delhi, and his brother,\r\nMr. Chunder Sen, had the opportunity of examining the fakir while\r\npassing into a state of hibernation, and found that the pulse beat\r\nslower and slower until it ceased to beat at all. The stethoscope was\r\napplied to the heart by the doctor, who failed to detect the slightest\r\nmotion. The fakir, covered with a white shroud, was placed in a small\r\nsubterraneous cell built of masonry, measuring about six feet by six\r\nfeet, of rotund structure. The door was closed and locked, and the\r\nlock sealed with Dr. Sen’s private seal and with that of Mr. Dhanna\r\nTal, the magistrate of the city; the flap door leading to the vault\r\nwas also carefully fastened. At the expiration of thirty-three days\r\nthe cell was opened, and the fakir was found just where he was placed,\r\nbut with a death-like appearance, the limbs having become stiff as in\r\n_rigor mortis_. He was brought from the vault, and the mouth was rubbed\r\nwith honey and milk, and the body and joints massaged with oil. In the\r\nevening, manifestations of life were exhibited, and the fakir was fed\r\nwith a spoonful of milk. The next day he was given a little juice of\r\npulses known as _dal_, and in three days he was able to eat bread and\r\nmilk, his normal diet. These cases are well known both at Delhi and\r\nat Jeypore, and the facts have never been disputed. The fakir is a\r\nSanscrit scholar, and is said to be endowed with much wisdom, and is\r\nconsulted by those who are interested in Hindu learning and religion.\r\nHe has never received money from visitors, and the mention of it\r\ndistresses him.\r\n\r\nThe _Medical Times_ of May 11, 1850, contains a communication from Mr.\r\nBraid, who says he has “lost no opportunity of accumulating evidence\r\non this subject, and that while many alleged feats of this kind are\r\nprobably of a deceptive character, still there are others which admit\r\nof no such explanation; and that it becomes the duty of scientific men\r\nfairly to admit the difficulty.” He then refers to two documents by\r\neye-witnesses of these feats, and which, he says, “with the previous\r\nevidence on the subject, must set the point at rest for ever, as to\r\nthe fact of the feats referred to being genuine phenomena, deception\r\nbeing impossible.” In one of these instances, the fakir was buried in\r\nthe ground for six weeks, and was, consequently, deprived not only of\r\nfood and drink, but also of light and air; when he was disinterred,\r\nhis legs and arms were shrivelled and stiff, but his face was full;\r\nno pulse could be discovered in the heart, temples, or arms. “About\r\nthree years since I spent some time with a General C----, a highly\r\nrespectable and intelligent man, who had been a long time in the Indian\r\nservice, and who was himself an eye-witness of one of these feats. A\r\nfakir was buried several feet in the earth, under vigilant inspection,\r\nand a watch was set, so that no one could communicate with him; and to\r\nmake the matter doubly sure, corn was sown upon the grave, and during\r\nthe time the man was buried, it vegetated and grew to the height of\r\nseveral inches. He lay there forty-two days. The gentleman referred to\r\npassed the place many times during his burial, saw the growing corn,\r\nwas also present at his disinterment, and when he questioned the man,\r\nand intimated to him that he thought deception had been practised, the\r\nfakir offered, for a sum of money, to be buried again, for the same\r\nlength of time, by the General himself, and in his own garden. This\r\nchallenge, of course, closed the argument.”\r\n\r\n[CASES REPORTED BY MR. BRAID.]\r\n\r\nCases of this kind might be multiplied on evidence which cannot be\r\ndoubted, and, in Mr. Braid’s book, entitled “Human Hibernation,” there\r\nare cases fully stated. Sir Claude Wade, who was an eye-witness of\r\nthese feats when acting as political agent at the Court of Runjeet\r\nSingh, at Lahore, and from whom Mr. Braid derived his information,\r\nmakes the following observations:--“I share entirely in the apparent\r\nincredibility of the fact of a man being buried alive and surviving the\r\ntrial for various periods of duration; but however incompatible with\r\nour knowledge of physiology, in the absence of any visible proof to the\r\ncontrary, I am bound to declare my belief in the facts which I have\r\nrepresented, however impossible their existence may appear to others.”\r\nUpon this Mr. Braid observes:--“Such then is the narrative of Sir C.\r\nM. Wade, and when we consider the high character of the author as a\r\ngentleman of honour, talents, and attainments of the highest order,\r\nand the searching, painstaking efforts displayed by him throughout the\r\nwhole investigation, and his close proximity to the body of the fakir,\r\nand opportunity of observing minutely every point for himself, as well\r\nas the facilities, by his personal intercourse with Runjeet Singh and\r\nthe whole of his Court, of gaining the most accurate information on\r\nevery point, I conceive it is impossible to have had a more valuable\r\nor conclusive document for determining the fact that no collusion or\r\ndeception existed.”\r\n\r\nA case of this kind was exhibited at the Westminster Aquarium in the\r\nautumn of 1895, which was carefully watched and tested by medical\r\nexperts, without detection of any appearance of fraud or simulation.\r\nThe hypnotised man, Walter Johnson, an ex-soldier, twenty-nine years of\r\nage, was in a trance which lasted thirty days, during which time he was\r\nabsolutely unconscious, as shown by the various experiments to which he\r\nwas subjected.\r\n\r\nA case of induced trance and experimental burial, not unlike that\r\nof the Indian fakirs referred to, was reported in the London _Daily\r\nChronicle_, March 14, 1896. The experiment was carried out under test\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n “‘BURIED ALIVE’ AT THE ROYAL AQUARIUM.\r\n\r\n “After being entombed for six days in a hypnotic trance, Alfred\r\n Wootton was dug up and awakened at the Royal Aquarium (Westminster),\r\n on Saturday night in the presence of a crowd of interested spectators.\r\n Wootton was hypnotised on Monday by Professor Fricker, and consigned\r\n to his voluntary grave, nine feet deep, in view of the audience, who\r\n sealed the stout casket or coffin in which the subject was immured.\r\n Seven or eight feet of earth were then shovelled upon the body, a\r\n shaft being left open for the necessary respiration, and in order\r\n that the public might be able to see the man’s face during the week.\r\n The experiment was a novel one in this country, and was intended to\r\n illustrate the extraordinary effect produced by the Indian fakirs,\r\n and to demonstrate the connection between hypnotism and psychology,\r\n while also showing the value of the former art as a curative agent.\r\n Wootton is a man thirty-eight years of age; he is a lead-worker,\r\n and on Monday weighed 10st. 2-1/2 lbs. He had previously been in a\r\n trance for a week in Glasgow, under Professor Fricker’s experienced\r\n hands, so was not altogether new to the business; but he is the\r\n first to be ‘buried alive’ by way of amusement. To the uninitiated\r\n the whole thing was gruesome in the extreme, and this particular form\r\n of entertainment certainly cannot be commended. Before being covered\r\n in, Wootton’s nose and ears were stopped with wax, which was removed\r\n before he was revived on Saturday. The theory of the burial is to\r\n secure an equable temperature day and night--which is impossible when\r\n the subject is above ground in the ordinary way--and therefore to\r\n induce a deeper trance. Of course, too, the patient was out of reach\r\n of the operator, and no suspicion of continuous hypnotising could rest\r\n upon the professor. No nourishment could be supplied for the same\r\n reason, though the man’s lips were occasionally moistened by means of\r\n a damp sponge on the end of a rod, and no record of temperature or\r\n respiration could be kept. A good many people witnessed the digging\r\n up process, and the awakening took place in the concert room, whither\r\n the casket and its burden were conveyed. The professor was not long\r\n in arousing his subject, after electric and other tests had been\r\n applied to convince the audience that the man was perfectly insensible\r\n to pain and everything else. Indeed, a large needle was run through\r\n the flesh on the back of the hand without any effect whatever. The\r\n first thing on regaining consciousness that Wootton said was that he\r\n could not see, and then he asked for drink--milk, and subsequently\r\n a little brandy, being supplied. As soon as possible the patient\r\n was lifted out of his box, and with help was quickly able to walk\r\n about the platform. He complained of considerable stiffness of the\r\n limbs, and was undoubtedly weak, but otherwise seemed none the worse\r\n for his remarkable retirement from active life, and abstention from\r\n food for nearly a week. He was swathed in flannel, and soon found\r\n the heat of the room very oppressive, though at first he appeared to\r\n be particularly anxious to have his overcoat and his boots. It is\r\n anticipated that in a day or two at most Wootton will have regained\r\n his usual vigorous health.”\r\n\r\n[EXPERIMENTAL BURIAL.]\r\n\r\nDr. Hartmann in “Premature Burial,” page 23, relates an account of a\r\nsimilar experiment with a fakir, differing from the above, however,\r\nin so far as it was made by some English residents, who did not put\r\nthe coffin into the earth, but hung it up in the air, so as to protect\r\nit from the danger of being eaten up by white ants. There seems to be\r\nhardly any limitation in regard to the time during which such a body\r\nmay be preserved and become reanimated again, provided that it is well\r\nprotected, although modern ignorance may smile at this statement.\r\n\r\nThose of our readers who wish to pursue this subject will find ample\r\nmaterial in “Observations on Trance or Human Hibernation,” 1850, by\r\nJames Braid, M.R.C.S.; Dr. Kuhn’s report of his investigations of the\r\nIndian fakirs to the Anthropological Society of Munich, in 1895; the\r\nresearches of Dr. J. M. Honigberger, a German physician long resident\r\nin India; and in the _India Journal of Medical and Physical Science_,\r\n1836, vol. i., p. 389, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPREMATURE BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the sitting of the Paris Academy of Medicine, on April 10, 1827, a\r\npaper was read by M. Chantourelle, on the danger of hasty burial. This\r\nled to a discussion, in which M. Desgenettes stated that he had been\r\ntold by Dr. Thouret, who presided at the destruction of the vaults of\r\nLes Innocens, that many skeletons had been found in positions seeming\r\nto show that they had turned in their coffins. Dr. Thouret was so much\r\nimpressed by the circumstance that he had a special clause inserted in\r\nhis will relating to his own burial.[4]\r\n\r\nSimilar revelations, according to Kempner, have followed the\r\nexaminations of grave-yards in Holland, and in New York and other parts\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, 1896, the author visited the grave of Madam Blunden, in the\r\nCemetery, Basingstoke, Hants, who, according to the inscription (now\r\nobliterated), was buried alive. The following narrative appears in “The\r\nUncertainty of the Signs of Death,” by Surgeon M. Cooper, London, 1746,\r\npp. 78, 79:--\r\n\r\n“At Basingstoke, in Hampshire, not many years ago, a gentlewoman of\r\ncharacter and fortune was taken ill, and, to all appearance, died,\r\nwhile her husband was on a journey to London. A messenger was forthwith\r\ndespatched to the gentleman, who returned immediately, and ordered\r\neverything for her decent interment. Accordingly, on the third day\r\nafter her supposed decease, she was buried in Holy Ghost Chapel, at the\r\noutside of the town, in a vault belonging to the family, over which\r\nthere is a school for poor children endowed by a charitable gentleman\r\nin the reign of Edward VI. It happened the next day that the boys,\r\nwhile they were at play, heard a noise in the vault, and one of them\r\nran and told his master, who, not crediting what he said, gave him a\r\nbox on the ear and sent him about his business; but, upon the other\r\nboys coming with the same story, his curiosity was awakened, so that he\r\nsent immediately for the sexton, and opened the vault and the lady’s\r\ncoffin, where they found her just expiring. All possible means were\r\nused to recover her to life, but to no purpose, for she, in her agony,\r\nhad bit the nails off her fingers, and tore her face and head to that\r\ndegree, that, notwithstanding all the care that was taken of her, she\r\ndied in a few hours in inexpressible torment.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sunday Times_, London, December 30, 1838, contains the following:--\r\n\r\n “A frightful case of premature interment occurred not long since,\r\n at Tonneins, in the Lower Garonne. The victim, a man in the prime\r\n of life, had only a few shovelfuls of earth thrown into his grave,\r\n when an indistinct noise was heard to proceed from his coffin. The\r\n grave-digger, terrified beyond description, instantly fled to seek\r\n assistance, and some time elapsed before his return, when the crowd,\r\n which had by this time collected in considerable numbers round the\r\n grave, insisted on the coffin being opened. As soon as the first\r\n boards had been removed, it was ascertained, beyond a doubt, that the\r\n occupant had been interred alive. His countenance was frightfully\r\n contracted with the agony he had undergone; and, in his struggles, the\r\n unhappy man had forced his arms completely out of the winding sheet,\r\n in which they had been securely enveloped. A physician, who was on the\r\n spot, opened a vein, but no blood followed. The sufferer was beyond\r\n the reach of art.”\r\n\r\n[RESUSCITATION IN GREENWOOD CEMETERY.]\r\n\r\nMr. Oscar F. Shaw, Attorney-at-Law, 145 Broadway, New York, furnished\r\nthe author with particulars of the following case, of which he had\r\npersonal knowledge:--“In or about the year 1851, Virginia M’Donald,\r\nwho, up to that time had lived with her father on Catharine Street,\r\nin the City of New York, apparently died, and was buried in Greenwood\r\nCemetery, Brooklyn, N.Y.\r\n\r\n“After the burial her mother declared her belief that the daughter\r\nwas not dead when buried, and persistently asserted her belief. The\r\nfamily tried in various ways to assure the mother of the death of her\r\ndaughter, and even resorted to ridicule for that purpose; but the\r\nmother insisted so long and so strenuously that her daughter was buried\r\nalive, that finally the family consented to having the body taken up,\r\nwhen to their horror, they discovered the body lying on the side, the\r\nhands badly bitten, and every indication of a premature burial.”\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_, May 22, 1858, p. 519, has the following:--\r\n\r\n  “INTERMENT BEFORE DEATH.\r\n\r\n “A case of restoration to consciousness after burial is recorded by\r\n the Austrian journals in the person of a rich manufacturer, named\r\n Oppelt, at Rudenberg. He was buried fifteen years ago, and lately,\r\n on opening the vault, the lid of the coffin was found forced open,\r\n and his skeleton in a sitting posture in a corner of the vault. A\r\n Government Commission has reported on the matter.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lancet_, August 20, 1864, p. 219.\r\n\r\n  “PREMATURE INTERMENT.\r\n\r\n “Amongst the papers left by the great Meyerbeer, were some which\r\n showed that he had a profound dread of premature interment. He\r\n directed, it is stated, that his body should be left for ten days\r\n undisturbed, with the face uncovered, and watched night and day. Bells\r\n were to be fastened to his feet. And at the end of the second day\r\n veins were to be opened in the arm and leg. This is the gossip of the\r\n capital in which he died. The first impression is that such a fear is\r\n morbid. No doubt fewer precautions would suffice, but now and again\r\n cases occur which seem to warrant such a feeling, and to show that\r\n want of caution may lead to premature interment in cases unknown. An\r\n instance is mentioned by the _Ost. Deutscher Post_ of Vienna. A few\r\n days since, runs the story, in the establishment of the Brothers of\r\n Charity in that capital, the bell of the dead-room was heard to ring\r\n violently, and on one of the attendants proceeding to the place to\r\n ascertain the cause, he was surprised at seeing one of the supposed\r\n dead men pulling the bell-rope. He was removed immediately to another\r\n room, and hopes are entertained of his recovery.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Times_, July 7, 1867, p. 12, col. 3.\r\n\r\n “The _Journal de Pontarlier_ relates a case of premature interment.\r\n During the funeral, three days back, of a young woman at Montflorin,\r\n who had apparently died in an epileptic fit, the grave-digger, after\r\n having thrown a spadeful of earth on the coffin, thought he heard a\r\n moaning from the tomb. The body was consequently exhumed, and a vein\r\n having been opened, yielded blood almost warm and liquid. Hopes were\r\n for a moment entertained that the young woman would recover from her\r\n lethargy, but she never did so entirely, and the next day life was\r\n found to be extinct.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lancet_, October 19, 1867, p. 504.\r\n\r\n  “BURIED ALIVE.\r\n\r\n [INTERRED WITH USUAL FORMALITIES.]\r\n\r\n “The _Journal de Morlaix_ mentions that a young woman at Bohaste,\r\n France, who was supposed to have died from cholera a few days back,\r\n was buried on the following afternoon. The sexton, when about to\r\n fill in the grave, fancied that he heard a noise in the coffin, and\r\n sent for the medical officer, who, on removing the lid and examining\r\n the body, gave it as his opinion that the woman had been alive when\r\n buried.”\r\n\r\nThe official journal of the French Senate, January 30, 1869, records\r\nthat the attention of the Senate was called to this case by means\r\nof a petition signed by seven residents in Paris, and the facts are\r\nconfirmed by L. Roger, _Officier de Santé_.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Times_, May 6, 1874, p. 11, foot of col. 4.\r\n\r\n  “PREMATURE INTERMENT.\r\n\r\n “The _Messager du Midi_ relates the following dreadful story:--A young\r\n married woman residing at Salon (Bouches du Rhône) died shortly after\r\n her confinement in August last. The medical man, who was hastily\r\n summoned when her illness assumed a dangerous form, certified her\r\n death, and recommended immediate burial in consequence of the intense\r\n heat then prevailing, and six hours afterwards the body was interred.\r\n A few days since, the husband having resolved to re-marry, the mother\r\n of his late wife desired to have her daughter’s remains removed to her\r\n native town, Marseilles. When the vault was opened a horrible sight\r\n presented itself. The corpse lay in the middle of the vault, with\r\n dishevelled hair and the linen torn to pieces. It evidently had been\r\n gnawed in her agony by the unfortunate victim. The shock which the\r\n dreadful spectacle caused to the mother has been so great that fears\r\n are entertained for her reason, if not for her life.”\r\n\r\nThe _British Medical Journal_, December 8, 1877, p. 819, inserts the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n  “BURIED ALIVE.\r\n\r\n “A correspondent at Naples states that the Appeal Court has had before\r\n it a case not likely to inspire confidence in the minds of those who\r\n look forward with horror to the possibility of being buried alive. It\r\n appeared from the evidence that some time ago a woman was interred\r\n with all the usual formalities, it being believed that she was dead,\r\n while she was only in a trance. Some days afterwards, the grave in\r\n which she had been placed being opened for the reception of another\r\n body, it was found that the clothes which covered the unfortunate\r\n woman were torn to pieces, and that she had even broken her limbs in\r\n attempting to extricate herself from the living tomb. The Court, after\r\n hearing the case, sentenced the doctor who had signed the certificate\r\n of decease, and the mayor who had authorised the interment, each to\r\n three months’ imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Daily Telegraph_, January 18, 1889.\r\n\r\n “A gendarme was buried alive the other day in a village near Grenoble.\r\n The man had become intoxicated on potato brandy, and fell into a\r\n profound sleep. After twenty hours passed in slumber, his friends\r\n considered him to be dead, particularly as his body assumed the\r\n usual rigidity of a corpse. When the sexton, however, was lowering\r\n the remains of the ill-fated gendarme into the grave, he heard moans\r\n and knocks proceeding from the interior of the ‘four-boards.’ He\r\n immediately bored holes in the sides of the coffin, to let in air, and\r\n then knocked off the lid. The gendarme had, however, ceased to live,\r\n having horribly mutilated his head in his frantic but futile efforts\r\n to burst his coffin open.”\r\n\r\n[EVIDENCE OF UNDERTAKERS.]\r\n\r\n[HORRIFYING CASES.]\r\n\r\nThe _Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal_, July 22, 1889,\r\nrelates the following cases:--\r\n\r\n “A New York undertaker recently told the following story, the\r\n circumstances of which are still remembered by old residents of the\r\n city:--‘About forty years ago a lady living on Division Street, New\r\n York City, fell dead, apparently, while in the act of dancing at a\r\n ball. It was a fashionable affair, and being able to afford it, she\r\n wore costly jewellery. Her husband, a flour merchant, who loved her\r\n devotedly, resolved that she should be interred in her ball dress,\r\n diamonds, pearls, and all; also that there should be no autopsy. As\r\n the weather was very inclement when the funeral reached the cemetery,\r\n the body was placed in the receiving vault for burial next day. The\r\n undertaker was not a poor man, but he was avaricious, and he made up\r\n his mind to possess the jewellery. He went in the night, and took\r\n the lady’s watch from the folds of her dress. He next began to draw\r\n a diamond ring from her finger, and in doing so had to use violence\r\n enough to tear the skin. Then the lady moved and groaned, and the\r\n thief, terrified and conscience-stricken, fled from the cemetery, and\r\n has never been since heard from, that I know of. The lady, after the\r\n first emotions of horror at her unheard-of position had passed over,\r\n gathered her nerves together and stepped out of the vault, which\r\n the thief had left open. How she came home I cannot tell; but this\r\n I know--she lived and had children, two at least of whom are alive\r\n to-day.’\r\n\r\n “Another New York undertaker told this story. The New York papers\r\n thirty-five years ago were full of its ghastly details. ‘The daughter\r\n of a Court Street baker died. It was in winter, and the father,\r\n knowing that a married sister of his dead child, who lived in St.\r\n Louis, would like to see her face before laid in the grave for ever,\r\n had the body placed in the vault, waiting her arrival. The sister\r\n came, the vault was opened, the lid of the coffin taken off, when,\r\n to the unutterable horror of the friends assembled, they found the\r\n grave-clothes torn in shreds, and the fingers of both hands eaten off.\r\n The girl had been buried alive.’\r\n\r\n “Until about forty years ago a noted family of Virginia preserved a\r\n curious custom, which had been religiously observed for more than a\r\n century. Over a hundred years ago a member of the family died, and,\r\n upon being exhumed, was found to have been buried alive. From that\r\n time until about 1850, every member of the family, man, woman, or\r\n child, who died, was stabbed in the heart with a knife in the hands of\r\n the head of the house. The reason for the cessation of this custom was\r\n that in 1850 or thereabouts a beautiful young girl was supposed to be\r\n dead, the knife was plunged into her bosom, when she gave vent to a\r\n fearful scream and died. She had merely been in a trance. The incident\r\n broke her father’s heart, and in a fit of remorse he killed himself\r\n not long afterwards.\r\n\r\n “There are many families in the United States who, when any of their\r\n number dies, insist that an artery be opened to determine whether life\r\n has fled or not.”\r\n\r\nThe following remarkable case of waking in the grave is reported from\r\nVienna:--\r\n\r\n “A lady residing at Derbisch, near Kolin, in Bohemia, where she owned\r\n considerable property, was buried last week, after a brief illness,\r\n in the family vault at the local cemetery. Four days afterwards her\r\n granddaughter was interred in the same place, but as the stone slab\r\n covering the aperture was removed, the bystanders were horrified to\r\n see that the lid of the coffin below had been raised, and that the arm\r\n of the corpse was protruding. It was ascertained eventually that the\r\n unfortunate lady, who was supposed to have died of heart disease, had\r\n been buried alive. She had evidently recovered consciousness for a few\r\n minutes, and had found strength enough to burst open her coffin. The\r\n authorities are bent on taking measures of the utmost severity against\r\n those responsible.”--_Undertakers’ Journal, August 22, 1889._\r\n\r\nThe _Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal_, July 22, 1890.\r\n\r\n “A horrible story comes from Majola, Mantua. The body of a woman,\r\n named Lavrinia Merli, a peasant, who was supposed to have died from\r\n hysterics, was placed in a vault on Thursday, July 3. On Saturday\r\n evening it was found that the woman had regained consciousness, torn\r\n her grave-clothes in her struggles, had turned completely over in the\r\n coffin, and had given birth to a seven-months’-old child. Both mother\r\n and child were dead when the coffin was opened for the last time\r\n previous to interment.”\r\n\r\n “A shocking occurrence is reported from Cesa, a little village\r\n near Naples. A woman living at that place was recently seized with\r\n sudden illness. A doctor who was called certified that the woman was\r\n dead, and the body was consequently placed in a coffin, which was\r\n deposited in the watch-house of the local cemetery. Next day an old\r\n woman passing close to the cemetery thought she heard smothered cries\r\n proceeding from the watch-house. The family was informed, but when the\r\n lid of the coffin was forced off a shocking spectacle presented itself\r\n to the gaze of the horrified villagers. The wretched woman had turned\r\n on her side, and the position of her arm showed that she had made a\r\n desperate effort to raise the lid. The eldest son, who was among the\r\n persons who broke open the coffin, received such a shock that he died\r\n three days later.”--_Undertakers’ Journal, September 22, 1893._\r\n\r\nThe _Progressive Thinker_, of November 14, 1891, relates that:--\r\n\r\n “Farmer George Hefdecker, who lived at Erie, Pa., died very suddenly\r\n two weeks ago, of what is supposed to have been heart failure. The\r\n body was buried temporarily four days later in a neighbour’s lot in\r\n the Erie cemetery pending the purchase of one by his family. The\r\n transfer was made in a few days, and when the casket was opened at\r\n the request of his family, a horrifying spectacle was presented. The\r\n body had turned round, and the face and interior of the casket bore\r\n the traces of a terrible struggle with death in its most awful shape.\r\n The distorted and blood-covered features bore evidence of the agony\r\n endured. The clothing about the head and neck had been torn into\r\n shreds, as was likewise the lining of the coffin. Bloody marks of\r\n finger nails on the face, throat, and neck, told of the awful despair\r\n of the doomed man, who tore his own flesh in his terrible anguish.\r\n Several fingers had been entirely bitten off, and the hands torn with\r\n the teeth until they scarcely resembled those of a human being.”\r\n\r\nFrom the London _Echo_, October 6, 1894.\r\n\r\n  “BURIED ALIVE.\r\n\r\n “A story of a horrible nature comes from St. Petersburg in connection\r\n with the interment at Tioobayn, near that city, of a peasant girl\r\n named Antonova. She had presumably died, and in due course the funeral\r\n took place. After the service at the cemetery, the grave-diggers were\r\n startled by sounds of moaning proceeding from the coffin. Instead,\r\n however, of instantly breaking it open, they rushed off to find a\r\n doctor, and when he and some officials arrived and broke open the\r\n shell, the unhappy inmate was already the corpse she had been supposed\r\n to be a day earlier. It was evident, however, that no efforts could\r\n have saved life at the last moment. The body was half-turned in the\r\n coffin, the left hand, having escaped its bandages, being under the\r\n cheek.”\r\n\r\nThe following case, cabled by Dalziel, appears in the London _Star_,\r\nAugust 19, 1895:--\r\n\r\n  “SOUNDS FROM ANOTHER COFFIN.\r\n\r\n  “Grenoble, August 17.\r\n\r\n “On Monday last a man was found in a dying condition by the side of\r\n a brook near the village of Le Pin. Everything possible was done\r\n for him, but he relapsed into unconsciousness, and became to all\r\n appearances dead. The funeral was arranged, and, there being no\r\n suspicion of foul play, the body was interred on the following day.\r\n The coffin had been lowered to the bottom of the grave, and the\r\n sexton had begun to cover it with earth, when he heard muffled sounds\r\n proceeding from it. The earth was hastily removed and the coffin\r\n opened, when it was discovered that the unfortunate occupant was\r\n alive. He was taken to a neighbouring house, but rapidly sank into\r\n a comatose condition, and died without uttering a word. The second\r\n burial took place yesterday.”\r\n\r\nWhile in India, in the early part of this year (1896), Dr. Roger S.\r\nChew, of Calcutta, who, having been laid out for dead, and narrowly\r\nescaped living sepulture, has had the best reasons for studying the\r\nsubject, gave me particulars of the following cases:--\r\n\r\n “Frank Lascelles, aged thirty-two years, was seated at breakfast with\r\n a number of us young fellows, and was in the middle of a burst of\r\n hearty laughter, when his head fell forward on his plate and he was\r\n ‘dead.’ As there was a distinct history of cardiac disease in his\r\n family, while he himself had frequently been treated for valvular\r\n disease of the heart, he was alleged to have ‘died’ of cardiac\r\n failure, and was duly interred in the Coonor Cemetery. Some six months\r\n later, permission was obtained to remove his remains to St. John’s\r\n Church-yard in Ootacamund. The coffin was exhumed, and, as a ‘matter\r\n of form,’ the lid removed to identify the resident, when, to the\r\n horror of the lookers-on, it was noticed that, though mummification\r\n had taken place, there had been a fearful struggle underground, for\r\n the body, instead of being on its back as it was when first coffined,\r\n was _lying on its face_, with its arms and legs drawn up as close\r\n as the confined space would permit. His trousers (a perfectly new\r\n pair) were burst at the left knee, while his shirt-front was torn to\r\n ribands and bloodstained, and the wood of that portion of the coffin\r\n immediately below his mouth was stained a deep reddish-brown-black\r\n (_blood_). Old Dr. Donaldson, whom we were all very fond of, tried to\r\n explain matters by saying that the jolting of the coffin on its way\r\n to the cemetery had overturned the body, and that the blood stains on\r\n the shirt and wood were the natural result of blood flowing (_i.e._\r\n oozing) out of the mouth of the corpse as it lay face downwards.\r\n A nice theory, but scarcely a probable one, as all the jolting in\r\n creation could not possibly turn a corpse over in an Indian coffin,\r\n which is so built that there is scarcely two inches spare space over\r\n any portion of the contained body, and unless the supposed corpse\r\n regained consciousness and exerted _considerable_ force, it could not\r\n possibly turn round in its _narrow_ casket.\r\n\r\n [DR. ROGER S. CHEW’S CASES.]\r\n\r\n “Mary Norah Best, aged seventeen years, an adopted daughter of Mrs.\r\n C. A. Moore, _née_ Chew, ‘died’ of cholera, and was entombed in the\r\n Chew’s vault in the old French cemetery, at Calcutta. The certifying\r\n surgeon was a man who would have benefited by her death, and had twice\r\n (though ineffectually) attempted to put an end to her adopted mother,\r\n who fled from India to England after the second attempt on her life,\r\n but, unfortunately, left the girl behind. When Mary ‘died’ she was\r\n put into a _pine_ coffin, the lid of which was _nailed_, not screwed,\r\n down. In 1881, ten years or so later, the vault was unsealed to admit\r\n the body of Mrs. Moore’s brother, J. A. A. Chew. On entering the\r\n vault, the undertaker’s assistant and I found the lid of Mary’s coffin\r\n on the floor, while the position of the skeleton (half in, half out of\r\n the coffin, and an ugly gash across the right parietal bone) _plainly_\r\n showed that after being entombed Mary awoke from her trance, struggled\r\n violently till she wrenched the lid off her coffin, when she either\r\n fainted away with the strain of the effort in bursting open her\r\n casket, and while falling forward over the edge of her coffin struck\r\n her head against the masonry shelf, and died almost immediately;\r\n or, worse still,--as surmised by some of her clothing which was\r\n found hanging over the edge of the coffin, and the position of her\r\n right hand, the fingers of which were bent and close to where her\r\n throat would have been had the flesh not rotted away,--she recovered\r\n consciousness, fought for life, forced her coffin open, and, sitting\r\n up in the pitchy darkness of the vault, went mad with fright, tore her\r\n clothes off, tried to throttle herself, and banged her head against\r\n the masonry shelf until she fell forward senseless and dead.”\r\n\r\nDr. Chew says:--“Though a layman, still it would be hard to find\r\na more indefatigable sanitarian than my late commanding officer,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel R. C. Sterndale, of the Presidency Volunteer Rifle\r\nBattalion, and for many years vice-chairman of the municipality of the\r\nsuburbs of Calcutta. In order to prove his theory that a great deal of\r\ndanger existed in the rainy season from subsoil water rising up into\r\nthe graves, saturating the bodies, and then poisoning the neighbouring\r\ntanks and wells, he caused a trench, ten feet long, six deep, and four\r\nwide, to be dug across an old Mahomedan grave-yard. Soundings and\r\nmeasurements having been taken of the subsoil water, he had a tarpaulin\r\nstretched over the trench, and daily measured the ‘fall’ of the\r\nwater-level. He had a drawing made of the section of that grave-yard\r\nin which the action of the nitre-laden water seemed to mummify some\r\nof the bodies. Amongst the rest was a somewhat mummified male corpse\r\nwhich, instead of being on his back, was lying on his abdomen; the left\r\narm supported the chin, but had a piece of it missing; the right hand\r\nclutched the left elbow, and the general position of the body was as\r\nif, consciousness having returned, the alleged corpse sat up, found\r\nthe weight of the earth too heavy to work through, and then, dying of\r\nsuffocation, fell forward in the position in which it was found and\r\nexposed.”\r\n\r\nDr. Chew adds:--“I have heard and read of several other instances, but,\r\nas they have not come within my personal observation, I do not mention\r\nor refer to them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nNARROW ESCAPES FROM PREMATURE BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOST every intelligent and observant person you converse with,\r\nif the subject is introduced, has either known or heard of narrow\r\nescapes of premature burial within his or her own circle of friends\r\nor acquaintances; and it is no exaggeration to say that such cases\r\nare numbered by thousands. It is to be hoped that the number of\r\ntimely discoveries vastly exceed those actually interred in a state\r\nof suspended animation; but as no investigation of grave-yards or\r\ncemeteries (which effectually conceal their own tragedies) has ever\r\ntaken place in England until the remains are reduced to dust, and\r\nrarely in other countries, one cannot be sure that this optimistic view\r\nis correct. The following cases of narrow escape appear to rest upon\r\ntrustworthy evidence.\r\n\r\nAn apparent suspension of life, following a serious illness, is usually\r\nconsidered a satisfactory proof of the reality of the expected death;\r\nbut these conditions cannot always be relied upon. Cases are on record\r\nwhere the objects of such simulacra of death appear, if let alone, to\r\ngather the essence of renewed vitality, and return to consciousness.\r\nThe _Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal_ of May, 1888, has a\r\ncase in point.\r\n\r\n[A RESUSCITATED HUMORIST.]\r\n\r\n “Mrs. Lockhart, of Birkhill, who died in 1825, used to relate to\r\n her grandchildren the following anecdote of her ancestor, Sir\r\n William Lindsay, of Covington, towards the close of the seventeenth\r\n century:--‘Sir William was a humorist, and noted, moreover, for\r\n preserving the picturesque appendage of a beard at a period when the\r\n fashion had long passed away. He had been extremely ill, and life\r\n was at last supposed to be extinct, though, as it afterwards turned\r\n out, he was merely in a “dead faint” or trance. The female relatives\r\n were assembled for the “chesting”--the act of putting a corpse into a\r\n coffin, with the entertainment given on such melancholy occasions--in\r\n a lighted chamber in the old tower of Covington, where the “bearded\r\n knight” lay stretched upon his bier. But when the servants were\r\n about to enter to assist at the ceremonies, Isabella Somerville, Sir\r\n William’s great-granddaughter, and Mrs. Lockhart’s grandmother, then\r\n a child, creeping close to her mother, whispered into her ear, “The\r\n beard is wagging! the beard is wagging!” Mrs. Somerville, upon this,\r\n looked to the bier, and observing indications of life in the ancient\r\n knight, made the company retire, and Sir William soon came out of his\r\n faint. Hot bottles were applied and cordials administered, and in\r\n the course of the evening he was able to converse with his family.\r\n They explained that they had believed him to be actually dead, and\r\n that arrangements had even been made for his funeral. In answer to\r\n the question, “Have the folks been warned?” (_i.e._, invited to the\r\n funeral) he was told that they had--that the funeral day had been\r\n fixed, an ox slain, and other preparations made for entertaining the\r\n company. Sir William then said, “All is as it should be; keep it a\r\n dead secret that I am in life, and let the folks come.” His wishes\r\n were complied with, and the company assembled for the burial at the\r\n appointed time. After some delay, occasioned by the non-arrival of\r\n the clergyman, as was supposed, and which afforded an opportunity of\r\n discussing the merits of the deceased, the door suddenly opened, when,\r\n to their surprise and terror, in stepped the knight himself, pale in\r\n countenance and dressed in black, leaning on the arm of the minister\r\n of the parish of Covington. Having quieted their alarm and explained\r\n matters, he called upon the clergyman to conduct an act of devotion,\r\n which included thanksgiving for his recovery and escape from being\r\n buried alive. This done, the dinner succeeded. A jolly evening, after\r\n the manner of the time, was passed, Sir William himself presiding over\r\n the carousals.’”\r\n\r\nDr. J. B. Vigné, in his “Memoire sur les Inhumations Précipitées,”\r\nParis, 1839, narrates the following:-- “Mr. B., an inhabitant of\r\nPoitiers, fell suddenly into a state resembling death; every means\r\nfor bringing him back to life were used without interruption; from\r\ncontinued dragging, his two little fingers were dislocated, and the\r\nsoles of his feet were burnt; but, all these having produced no\r\nsensation in him, he was thought decidedly dead. As they were on the\r\npoint of placing him in his coffin, some one recommended that he should\r\nbe bled in both arms and feet at the same time, which was immediately\r\ndone, and with such success that, to the astonishment of all, he\r\nrecovered from his apparent state of death. When he had entirely\r\nrecovered his senses, he declared that he had heard every word that had\r\nbeen said, and that his only fear was that he would be buried alive.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARENT DEATH IN PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nHufeland (one of the greatest authorities on the subject in Germany),\r\nin his essay upon the uncertainty of the signs of death, tells of a\r\ncase of the wife of Professor Camerer, of Tübingen, who was hysterical,\r\nand had a fright in the sixth month of her pregnancy, which brought\r\non convulsions (eclampsia), which continued for four hours, when she\r\nseemed to die completely. Two celebrated physicians, besides three\r\nothers of less note, regarded the case as ended in death, as all the\r\nrecognised signs of death were present. However, attempts to revive\r\nher were at once resorted to, and were continued for five hours, when\r\nall the medical attendants, except one, gave the case up, and left.\r\nThe physician who remained pulled off a blister-plaster that had\r\nbeen put on one of the feet, when the lady gave feeble signs of life\r\nby twitchings about the mouth. The doctor then renewed his efforts\r\nto revive her, by various stimulating means, and by burning, and by\r\npricking the spine; but all in vain, for after her slight evidences of\r\nrevival, she seemed to die unmistakably. She lay in a state of apparent\r\ndeath for six days, but there was a small space over the heart where a\r\nlittle warmth could be detected by the hand, and on this account the\r\nburial was put off. On the seventh day she opened her eyes, and slowly\r\nrevived, but was completely unconscious of all that had happened. She\r\nthen gave birth to a dead child, and soon thereafter recovered her\r\nhealth completely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[MORE CAREFUL EXAMINATION REQUIRED.]\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lancet_, November 27, 1858, p. 561.\r\n\r\n  “THE DEAD ALIVE.\r\n\r\n “It seems to be always desirable to obtain a contemporary record\r\n of all unusual phenomena. It is so more especially where they are\r\n of a somewhat indefinite character, and scarcely susceptible of\r\n exaggeration. We know of none which are more so than the cases of\r\n ‘trance.’ These examples are both sufficiently unusual to deserve a\r\n passing record, and sufficiently mysterious in their character to call\r\n for a more careful investigation than it has hitherto been possible to\r\n accord to them. We transcribe the facts of a recent instance, as they\r\n are circumstantially detailed, and, no doubt, some of the surgeons of\r\n Coventry will be able to afford their testimony as to the degree of\r\n correspondence of this narrative with their observations. “The girl,\r\n whose name is Amelia Hinks, is twelve or thirteen years of age, and\r\n resides with her parents in Bridge Street, Nuneaton. She had lately\r\n appeared to be sinking under the influence of some ill-explained\r\n disorder, and about three weeks since, as her friends imagined, she\r\n died. The body was removed to another room. It was rigid and icy cold.\r\n It was washed and laid out with all due funeral train. The limbs were\r\n decently placed, the eyelids closed and penny-pieces laid over them.\r\n The coffin was ordered. For more than forty-eight hours the supposed\r\n corpse lay beneath the winding-sheet, when it happened that her\r\n grandfather, coming from Leamington to assist in the last mournful\r\n ceremonies, went to see the corpse. The old man removed a penny-piece,\r\n and he thought that the corpse winked! There was a convulsive movement\r\n of the lid. This greatly disturbed his composure; for, though he had\r\n heard that she died with her eyes open, he was unprepared for this\r\n palpebral signal of her good understanding with death. A surgeon is\r\n said to have been summoned, who at first treated the matter as a\r\n delusion, but subsequently ascertained stethoscopically that there\r\n was still slight cardiac pulsation. The body was then removed to a\r\n warm room, and gradually the returning signs of animation became\r\n unequivocal. When speech was restored, the girl described many things\r\n which had taken place since her supposed death. She knew who had\r\n closed her eyes and placed the coppers thereon. She also heard the\r\n order given for her coffin, and could repeat the various remarks made\r\n over her as she lay in her death-clothes. She refused food, though in\r\n a state of extreme debility. She has since shown symptoms of mania,\r\n and is now said to have relapsed into a semi-cataleptic condition. The\r\n parents are ‘creditable people,’ and there is no apparent ruse in this\r\n unusually romantic history, which is causing considerable excitement\r\n in Nuneaton and its neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lancet_, December 18, 1858, p. 642.\r\n\r\n  “‘THE DEAD ALIVE.’\r\n\r\n  “(To the Editor of the _Lancet_.)\r\n\r\n “Sir,--An article, ‘The Dead Alive,’ in your impression of the 27th\r\n ultimo, demands of me a veritable statement of the case alluded to.\r\n The subject of the inquiry is still living, and for some time past has\r\n afforded me scope for observation.\r\n\r\n[THE DEAD ALIVE.]\r\n\r\n “I have only been waiting for a termination of the case, either in\r\n convalescence or death, to enable me to give to the profession,\r\n through your valuable columns, a full and truthful history of this\r\n rare and curious case, replete with interest. The exaggerated\r\n statement which has gone the round of the press has produced such\r\n great curiosity in this immediate neighbourhood that I have been\r\n applied to by many parties, professional and non-professional, to be\r\n permitted to see the case, the parents of the patient having refused\r\n admittance to all strangers.\r\n\r\n “The case having extended over a long period, and fearing a detailed\r\n account might occupy too much of your valuable space, I have condensed\r\n the matter as much as possible; but should the profession consider\r\n the case worthy of a more enlarged history, I will gladly, at some\r\n future period, meet their wishes, as far as my rough notes, aided by\r\n my memory, will supply it.\r\n\r\n “In August, 1858, I was requested to visit Miss Amelia Hincks, aged\r\n twelve years and nine months, daughter of a harness-maker, and\r\n residing with her parents in Bridge Street, Nuneaton. She was supposed\r\n to be suffering from pulmonary consumption.... On October 18, about\r\n half-past three a.m., she apparently died. She is said to have groaned\r\n heavily, waved her hands (which was a promised sign for her mother\r\n to know that the hour of her departure was come), turned her head\r\n a little to the light, dropped her jaw, and _died_. In about half\r\n an hour after her supposed departure she was washed, and attired in\r\n clean linen, the jaw was tied by a white handkerchief, penny-pieces\r\n laid over her eyes, her hands, semi-clenched, placed by her side,\r\n and her feet tied together by a piece of tape. She was then carried\r\n into another room, laid on a sofa, and covered over with a sheet. She\r\n appeared stiff and cold, two large books were placed on her feet, and\r\n I have no doubt she was considered to be a sweet corpse.\r\n\r\n “About nine a.m., the grandfather of the supposed dead went into the\r\n death-chamber to give a last kiss to his grandchild, when he fancied\r\n he saw a convulsive movement of the eyelid, he having raised one of\r\n the coins. He communicated this fact to the parents and mourning\r\n friends, but they ridiculed the old man’s statement, and said the\r\n movement of the eyelids was owing to the nerves working after death.\r\n Their theory, however, did not satisfy the experienced man of eighty\r\n years, and he could not reconcile himself to her death. As soon as\r\n I reached home, after having been out in the country all night, I\r\n was requested to see the child, to satisfy the old man that she was\r\n really dead. About half-past ten a.m. I called; and immediately\r\n on my entrance into the chamber I perceived a tremulous condition\r\n of the eyelids, such as we frequently see in hysterical patients.\r\n The penny-pieces had been removed by the grandfather. I placed a\r\n stethoscope over the region of the heart, and found that organ\r\n performing its functions perfectly and with tolerable force. I then\r\n felt for a radial pulse, which was easily detected, beating feebly,\r\n about seventy-five per minute. The legs and arms were stiff and cold,\r\n and the capillary circulation was so congested as at first sight to\r\n resemble incipient decomposition. I carefully watched the chest, which\r\n heaved quietly but almost imperceptibly; and immediately unbandaged\r\n the maiden, and informed her mourning parents that she was not dead.\r\n Imagine their consternation! The passing-bell had rung, the shutters\r\n were closed, the undertaker was on his way to measure her for her\r\n coffin, and other necessary preparations were being made for her\r\n interment. [The writer then proceeds to give interesting details as to\r\n the treatment of the case, and the means taken to promote recovery.]\r\n\r\n  “RICHARD BIRD MASON, M.R.C.S., L.S.A.\r\n\r\n “Bridge Street, Nuneaton, December 14, 1858.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lancet_, March 5, 1859, p. 254.\r\n\r\n\r\n “TRANCE.\r\n\r\n “Another case of trance is reported, in addition to those which we\r\n have lately recorded.

She\r\n recovered consciousness just before the funeral was to take place.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF PREMATURE BURIAL BEFORE THE FRENCH SENATE.\r\n\r\n[FRENCH CASES.]\r\n\r\nThe _Medical Times_, London, 1866, vol. i., p. 258, under the heading\r\n“Buried Alive” remarks as follows:--“The abundance of other topics\r\nhinders us at present from saying more than a few words on the\r\nconditions under which there may be real danger of burial before life\r\nis quite extinct. Now, we will only reproduce the cases reported by\r\nCardinal Archbishop Donnet, in the French Senate, in a discussion\r\non a petition that the time between death and burial should be\r\nlengthened. We will add one instance, which we have heard on the best\r\nauthority:--About thirty years ago, a young woman of eighteen, daughter\r\nof Madame Laligand, living in the Rue des Tonnelliers, at Beaune,\r\nin Burgundy, was supposed to have died. The ordinary measures were\r\ntaken for interment. The body was put in a coffin, and taken to the\r\nchurch; the funeral service was said, and the _cortége_ set out for\r\nthe cemetery; but on the road between the church and the cemetery the\r\nsupposed dead recovered power of motion and speech, was removed from\r\nthe coffin, put to bed, recovered, married, and lived eighteen years\r\nafterwards. She said she retained her consciousness during the whole\r\nof her supposed death, and had counted the nails that were driven\r\ninto her coffin. Statements such as these, and such as those made by\r\nthe Archbishop, will surely be subjected to the ordeal of a French\r\nscientific commission, and we may suspend our judgment for the present.\r\nTo return to his Eminence. He said he had the very best reasons for\r\nbelieving that the victims of hasty interments were more numerous than\r\npeople supposed. He considered the rules and regulations prescribed by\r\nthe law very judicious; but, unfortunately, they were, particularly in\r\nthe country, not always executed as they should be, nor was sufficient\r\nimportance attached to them. In the village he was stationed in as\r\nan assistant-curate in the first period of his sacerdotal life, he\r\nsaved two persons from being buried alive. The first an aged man, who\r\nlived twelve hours after the hour prescribed for his interment by the\r\nmunicipal officer; the second was a man who was quite restored to life.\r\nIn both cases a trance more prolonged than usual was taken for actual\r\ndeath. The other instances, says the _Times’_ correspondent, I give in\r\nthe words of the Archbishop:--\r\n\r\n “‘The next case that occurred to me was at Bordeaux. A young lady, who\r\n bore one of the most distinguished names in the Department, had passed\r\n through what was supposed the last agony, and, as apparently all was\r\n over, the father and mother were torn away from the heartrending\r\n spectacle. As God willed it, I happened to pass the door of the house\r\n at the moment, when it occurred to me to call and inquire how the\r\n young lady was going on. When I entered the room, the nurse, finding\r\n the body breathless, was in the act of covering the face, and, indeed,\r\n there was every appearance that life had departed. Somehow or other,\r\n it did not seem to me so certain as to the bystanders. I lady not to\r\n give up all hope--that I was come to cure her, and that I was about\r\n to pray by her side. “You do not see me,” I said, “but you hear what\r\n I am saying.” My presentiments were not unfounded. The word of hope I\r\n uttered reached her ear and effected a marvellous change, or, rather,\r\n called back the life that was departing. The young girl survived; she\r\n is now a wife, and mother of children, and this day is the happiness\r\n of two most respectable families.’\r\n\r\n“The Archbishop mentioned another instance of a similar revival in a\r\ntown in Hungary during the cholera of 1831, which he heard that day\r\nfrom one of his colleagues of the Senate, as they were mounting the\r\nstaircase. But the last related is so interesting, and made such a\r\nsensation, that it deserves to be repeated in his own words:--\r\n\r\n[CARDINAL DONNET’S EXPERIENCE.]\r\n\r\n “‘In the summer of 1826, on a close summer day, in a church which was\r\n exceedingly crowded, a young priest, who was in the act of preaching,\r\n was suddenly seized with giddiness in the pulpit. The words he was\r\n uttering became indistinct; he soon lost the power of speech, and\r\n sank down on the floor. He was taken out of the church and carried\r\n home. All was thought to be over. Some hours after, the funeral bell\r\n was tolled, and the usual preparations made for the interment. His\r\n eyesight was gone: but if he could see nothing, like the young lady I\r\n have alluded to he could hear, and I need not say that what reached\r\n his ears was not calculated to reassure him. The doctor came, examined\r\n him, and pronounced him dead; and after the usual inquiries as to\r\n his age and the place of his birth, etc., gave permission for his\r\n interment next morning. The venerable bishop, in whose cathedral the\r\n young priest was preaching when he was seized with the fit, came to\r\n his bedside to recite the “De Profundis.” The body was measured for\r\n the coffin. Night came on, and you will easily feel how inexpressible\r\n was the anguish of the living being in such a situation. At last,\r\n amid the voices murmuring around him, he distinguished that of one\r\n whom he had known from infancy. That voice produced a marvellous\r\n effect and superhuman effort. Of what followed I need say no more\r\n than that the seemingly dead man stood next day in the same pulpit.\r\n That young priest, gentlemen, is the same man who is now speaking\r\n before you, and who, more than forty years after that event, implores\r\n those in authority, not merely to watch vigilantly over the careful\r\n execution of the legal prescriptions with regard to interments, but\r\n to enact fresh ones in order to prevent the recurrence of irreparable\r\n misfortunes.’”\r\n\r\nTo this report of the _Medical Times_ it may be added that the\r\npetition of M. de Carnot furnished statistics showing the frequency of\r\nthese terrible disasters, and suggested various preventive measures,\r\nincluding the establishment of mortuaries, a longer interval between\r\ndeath and burial, and the application of scientific methods of\r\nrestoration where decomposition is not manifest. The reality of the\r\nterrible dangers, as pointed out by Cardinal Donnet, was confirmed by\r\nSenators Tourangin and Viscount de Baral, in the recital of other cases\r\nof premature interment.\r\n\r\nWhen the subject was revived in the Senate on January 29, 1869--on\r\nwhich occasion five petitions were presented, urging important reforms,\r\nand detailing other cases of premature interment,--Cardinal Donnet\r\nagain took part in the debate, and urged that no burial should be\r\npermitted without the signature of a doctor or officer of health, as\r\nwell as the written authorisation of the Mayor, so that the fact of\r\ndeath might always be verified. The Cardinal then furnished particulars\r\nof another recent case of premature interment in l’Est, and recalled\r\nthe fact that one of their honourable colleagues of the Senate, M. le\r\nComte de la Rue, had had a narrow escape from live sepulture.\r\n\r\nThe several petitions were forwarded to the Minister of the Interior,\r\nbut nothing was done to remedy the evil.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lancet_, June 2, 1866, p. 611.\r\n\r\n\r\n“ON SUSPENDED ANIMATION.\r\n\r\n“In the course of the address delivered by Dr. Brewer to the Guardians\r\nof St. George’s at St. James’s Hall, he adverted to the ‘laying-out’\r\ncase at St. Pancras.... Dr. Brewer ... dwelt upon the question of\r\nsuspended animation in a passage which really deserves to be quoted....\r\n\r\n[CASE REPORTED BY DR. BREWER.]\r\n\r\n “‘I have been more than once under a condition of apparently suspended\r\n respiration, and with circumstances less comfortable than those\r\n related of this babe; and yet, active as is my brain, and sensitive\r\n as is my body, I remember as well as though it were but yesterday\r\n that, on being restored to consciousness, no feeling of discomfort\r\n of any kind attended my experience on either occasion. It is under\r\n the truth to say I have known a score of cases of those who have been\r\n supposed dead being reanimated. It is not many months ago a friend of\r\n mine, a rector of a suburban parish, was pronounced by his medical\r\n attendant to be dead. His bed was arranged, and the room left in its\r\n silence. His daughter had re-entered and sat at the foot, and the\r\n solemn toll of his own church bell was vibrating through the chamber,\r\n when a hand drew aside the closed curtain, and a voice came from the\r\n occupant of the bed--“Elizabeth, my dear, what is that bell tolling\r\n for?” The daughter’s response was, perhaps, an unfortunate one: “_For\r\n you, papa._” Schwartz, the first eminent Indian missionary, was roused\r\n from his supposed death by hearing his favourite hymn sung over him\r\n previous to the last rites being performed, and his resuscitation made\r\n known by his joining in the verse.’”\r\n\r\nDr. B. W. Richardson quotes a case in the _Lancet_, 1888, vol.\r\nii., p. 1179, of a man who, in 1869, was rendered cataleptic by a\r\nlightning-stroke, and who narrowly escaped living burial.\r\n\r\nDr. Moore Russell Fletcher in his work on “Suspended Animation,” p. 26,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n “In June, 1869, a girl in Cleveland, Ohio, was taken ill, and after a\r\n short sickness died, and was laid out for burial; but as her mother\r\n insisted that she was not dead, efforts were made for some time to\r\n restore her to life, but in vain. Her mother, however, refused to let\r\n her be buried; and on the fifth day after that set for the funeral\r\n the slamming of a door aroused her, so that she recovered. She stated\r\n that, during most of the eight days which she lay there, she was\r\n conscious and heard what was said, although wholly unable to make the\r\n least motion.”\r\n\r\nDr. M. S. Tanner in a letter to the _New York Times_, January 18, 1880,\r\nmentions two cases where persons awakened from trance at the moment of\r\nsepulture described in turn what their feelings had been. Said one:--\r\n\r\n “Have you ever felt the paralysing influence of a horrible nightmare?\r\n If you have had such experience, then you are prepared to conceive of\r\n the mental agonies I endured when I realised that my friends believed\r\n me dead, and were making preparations for my burial. The hours and\r\n days of mental struggle spent in the vain endeavour to break loose\r\n from the vice-like grasp of this worse than horrible nightmare was a\r\n hell of torment such as no tongue can describe or pen portray.”\r\n\r\n[VERDICT OF FOURTEEN PHYSICIANS.]\r\n\r\nThe other instance mentioned by Dr. Tanner is that of Dr. Johnson of\r\nSt. Charles, Illinois, who in the hearing of Dr. Tanner, and in the\r\npresence of a large audience in Harrison’s Hall, Minneapolis, stated\r\nthat when a young man he was prostrated with a fever. He swooned away,\r\napparently dead. His attending physician said he was dead. His father\r\nwas faithless and unbelieving, and refused to bury him. He lay in this\r\ncondition, apparently dead, fourteen days. The attending physician\r\nbrought other physicians to examine the apparently lifeless form, and\r\nall stated unqualifiedly, “He is dead.” Some fourteen physicians, among\r\nthem many eminent professors, examined the body, and there was no\r\nambiguity in the expression of their conclusion that the boy was dead.\r\nBut the father still turned a deaf ear to all entreaties to prepare\r\nthe body for the grave. Public feeling was at last aroused. The health\r\nofficer and other city officers, acting in their official capacity, and\r\nby the advice of physicians, peremptorily demanded that the body be\r\ninterred without delay. On the fourteenth day the father yielded under\r\nprotest; preparations were made for the funeral, when the emotions of\r\nthe still living subject, who was conscious of all transpiring around\r\nhim, were so intense as to be the means of his deliverance. He awoke\r\nfrom his trance.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lancet_, June 7, 1884, p. 1058.\r\n\r\n\r\n “IMPORTANT SUGGESTION FROM AN M.D.\r\n\r\n “(To the Editor of the _Lancet_.)\r\n\r\n “Sir,--Without venturing to express an opinion on the case mentioned\r\n by the Rev. D. Williams[5] in the _Lancet_ of the 24th inst., I\r\n would beg to say that I have no doubt in my own mind but that people\r\n are sometimes ‘buried alive.’ An instance has come to my knowledge\r\n where this catastrophe was only avoided by a mere accident. A lady,\r\n about forty-five years of age, the wife of a clergyman in a northern\r\n county, was taken ill, and after some time, as was supposed, died.\r\n The funeral was delayed, and so was the closing of the coffin, in\r\n consequence of the absence of a son of the lady from home. When the\r\n boy arrived, the kissing, wailing, and commotion roused the supposed\r\n dead woman, and brought her to consciousness in her coffin. This\r\n lady would most probably have been buried alive were it not that the\r\n obsequies were delayed on account of the circumstance mentioned.\r\n\r\n “Now, may not cases more or less similar to this sometimes occur, with\r\n the catastrophe of ‘buried alive’ added to them? But no such case\r\n could happen if it were made compulsory that the interment of a body\r\n should not be allowed to take place until after decomposition had set\r\n in, as attested by a medical man.\r\n\r\n  “I am, Sir, yours truly,\r\n\r\n  “WM. O’NEILL, M.D.\r\n\r\n “Lincoln, May 26, 1884.”\r\n\r\nIt is not always safe to conclude that persons enfeebled by age, or\r\nexhausted by long and severe illness, and pronounced dead by the\r\nattendant doctor, are really so. _The Undertakers’ Journal_, August 23,\r\n1886, has the following:--\r\n\r\n “It appears that George O. Daniels, of Clinton, Kentucky, had been ill\r\n for several months, and at length, to all appearance, died. The body\r\n was put in a coffin, where it remained for twenty hours, awaiting the\r\n arrival of relatives to attend the funeral. At midnight the watchers\r\n who surrounded the coffin were startled by a deep groan emanating from\r\n it, and all but one, a German of the name of Wabbeking, rushed from\r\n the room. Wabbeking remained, and as the groans continued he raised\r\n the coffin-lid and saw that Daniels was alive. Seizing the body he\r\n placed it upright. A few spasmodic gasps, a shudder, and the corpse\r\n spoke. The relatives returned to find the man sitting in a chair, and\r\n conversing with reasonable strength. Mr. Daniels claims to have been\r\n perfectly conscious of everything which passed around him, but says he\r\n was unable to move a muscle. He heard the sobs of his relatives when\r\n he was pronounced dead by the doctors, and noticed the preparations\r\n for the funeral. He is about eighty years of age.”\r\n\r\nThe same journal for July 23, 1888, reports the following under the\r\nhead of\r\n\r\n “RETURNED TO LIFE TWICE.\r\n\r\n[RETURNED TO LIFE TWICE.]\r\n\r\n “The following details are given by the Cincinnati correspondent of\r\n the _New York Herald_ from Memphis, Tennessee:--Mrs. Dicie Webb keeps\r\n a grocery store on Beale Street, and is well known to hundreds. Two\r\n years ago John Webb, a son of Mrs. Webb, married Sarah Kelly, a pretty\r\n girl, to whom the mother-in-law became greatly attached. Before one\r\n year of their married life had passed, Mrs. Webb, jun., was stricken\r\n with consumption, and on several occasions came near dying. About a\r\n month ago the young woman became very anxious to visit her parents in\r\n Henderson County, and she was taken there. At first she appeared much\r\n improved, and hopes were felt that her life might be preserved through\r\n the summer, but two weeks ago last Tuesday a telegram announced her\r\n death, and the husband hurried to her parents’ home. Three days later\r\n he returned with the corpse. The mother-in-law pleaded so hard for a\r\n sight of the dead woman, that finally, despite the belief that the\r\n body was badly decomposed, it was decided to open the coffin. While\r\n looking at the placid face Mrs. Webb was terrified at beholding the\r\n eyelids of the dead woman slowly opening. The eyes did not have the\r\n stony stare of death, nor the intelligent gleam of life. Mrs. Webb\r\n was unable to utter a sound. She could not move, but stood gazing at\r\n the gruesome sight. Her horror was increased when the supposed corpse\r\n slowly sat upright and, in an almost inaudible voice, said, ‘Oh,\r\n where am I?’ At this the weeping woman screamed. Friends who rushed\r\n into the room were almost paralysed at the sight, and fled shrieking.\r\n But one bolder than the others returned and spoke to the woman, who\r\n asked to be laid on the bed. Hastily she was taken from the coffin\r\n and cared for. In the course of the day the resurrected woman fully\r\n regained her mental powers. The day following she related a wonderful\r\n story. She said she was cognisant of all that occurred, and did not\r\n lose consciousness until she was put aboard the train for Memphis.\r\n Soon after being placed in her mother-in-law’s house she came to her\r\n senses and knew all that was passing. While her mother-in-law was\r\n looking at her she made a supreme effort to speak. Mrs. Webb lived a\r\n number of days, when she again apparently died. The doctors pronounced\r\n her dead, and she was once more placed in the coffin. While the\r\n mother-in-law was taking her final farewell she heard a voice whisper,\r\n ‘Mother, don’t cry.’ Looking into the girl’s face, she saw the same\r\n look that she had noticed before. She called for help, and several\r\n women responded. Some one cried, ‘Shake her; she’s not dead.’ In the\r\n excitement of the moment, the women, it is thought, shook the life out\r\n of the poor consumptive, and last Saturday she was buried. The family\r\n and friends have endeavoured to keep the matter quiet.”\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Telegraph_, January 26, 1889, reports:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “A NARROW ESCAPE.\r\n\r\n “A Rochester correspondent telegraphs that a woman named Girvin,\r\n living at Burham, near Rochester, has just had a narrow escape of\r\n being buried alive. She fell into a kind of trance, which was mistaken\r\n for death. The coffin was ordered, and the usual preparations made for\r\n a funeral. But while a number of the relatives were gathered at the\r\n bedside bewailing their bereavement, the supposed corpse startled them\r\n by suddenly rising up in bed and asking what was the matter. The woman\r\n is making good progress towards convalescence.”\r\n\r\nAnd on July 6, 1889, the same journal says:--\r\n\r\n[A CASE AT ST. LEONARDS.]\r\n\r\n “Our St. Leonards correspondent telegraphs:--About a week ago the wife\r\n of a well-known tradesman in St. Leonards fell ill, and on Monday\r\n night last the doctor gave his opinion that she could not live through\r\n the next day. On Tuesday morning at ten o’clock the doctor pronounced\r\n his patient dead, the nurse who was in attendance confirming the\r\n opinion. The intimation of death naturally created great distress\r\n among the friends of the woman, who was laid out in grave-clothes,\r\n washed, and prepared for burial, and, being a Roman Catholic, a\r\n crucifix was placed in her hand as she lay on her bier. When it was\r\n announced that the woman was dying, a priest was sent for; but he\r\n could not attend, as he was out of the town at the time.\r\n\r\n “About a quarter to ten on Tuesday night the nurse entered the room\r\n without a light for the purpose of getting something which she knew\r\n where to find. Whilst in the darkened chamber she was startled to\r\n hear a slight cry proceeding from the bed where the body lay, and\r\n she rushed from the room in a terrible fright. The widower, hearing\r\n the scream of fright, rushed into the chamber with a light, and was\r\n astounded to find that his wife had raised herself up in the bed on\r\n her elbow. She faintly uttered the words, ‘Where am I?’ and again\r\n relapsed into a heavy sleep. The opportunity was seized of changing\r\n the shroud for proper habiliments, and in about an hour and a half\r\n she woke again perfectly conscious. Next morning she was told of what\r\n had occurred, but was quite ignorant of everything that had passed,\r\n thinking she had only had a long sleep. She is now doing well, and it\r\n is hoped she will soon be restored to health and strength. The doctor\r\n describes the case as the most remarkable he has ever met with in his\r\n experience.”\r\n\r\nDr. Frederick A. Floyer, of Mortimer, Berks, published the\r\nfollowing-case in the _Tocsin_, November 1, 1889, vol. i., p. 84, under\r\nthe head of “Premature Burial”:--\r\n\r\n“A narrow escape of this was recently communicated direct to the\r\nwriter, and as it has some extremely important bearings on the value\r\nof what are usually considered to be evidences of death, we give it as\r\ntold by the survivor, who is still alive in the form of a cheery and\r\nintelligent old lady in the fullest possession of her faculties and\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n“Herself the wife of a medical officer attached to the--th Regiment,\r\nshe was stationed at---- Island, where at the age of twenty-eight she\r\nwas safely confined. Shortly after this she was walking out with an\r\nattendant when she was taken suddenly ill with a painful spasm of the\r\nheart--what appears to have been an attack of angina pectoris--and was\r\nconveyed in-doors and propped up with pillows, suffering great pain,\r\nand although medical attendance was summoned, nothing was of avail,\r\nand she died--at least in the opinion of those around her, who paid\r\nthe proper attention to what they regarded as a corpse. It was the\r\ncustom there to bury at sundown any one who died during the day. We\r\nunderstand that in warm countries it is difficult to close the eyelids\r\nproperly, and so this lady, lying motionless and rigid, contemplated\r\nwith perfectly clear perception, but with an utter indifference, the\r\nbringing in of the coffin and the necessary preparations for her\r\ninterment; she remembers her children coming to take a last look at\r\nher, and then being taken down stairs.\r\n\r\n“She would never have lived to tell the story but for an accident,\r\nwhich happened in this way. Her nurse, who was much attached to her,\r\nwas stroking her face and the muscles of her jaw, and presently\r\ndeclared she heard a sound of breathing. Medical assistance was\r\nsummoned, and the mirror test applied, but the surface was undimmed.\r\nThen, to make sure, they opened a vein in each arm, but no blood\r\nflowed. No limb responded to stimulus, and they declared that the nurse\r\nwas mistaken, and that the body was dead beyond doubt.\r\n\r\n“But the nurse persisted in her belief and in her attentions, and did\r\nsucceed in establishing a sign of life. Then mustard applications to\r\nher feet and to the back of her neck, and burnt feathers applied to her\r\nnostrils, which she remembered burning her nose, completed her return\r\nto consciousness.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the _Pall Mall Gazette_, May 11, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n[CERTIFICATE OF APOPLEXY.]\r\n\r\n “NARROW ESCAPE FROM BEING BURIED ALIVE.\r\n\r\n “A Penn Station telegram to Dalziel says:--A singular case of\r\n simulation of death from fright occurred here on Saturday. Mrs.\r\n Sarseville, the wife of a farmer in this county, was in the cow-house\r\n attending to the dairy work when she saw a nest of squirming snakes\r\n through a hole in the plank floor. She fell to the ground apparently\r\n lifeless with fright. Help was summoned, and she was carried into the\r\n house. Before the physician arrived Mrs. Sarseville had begun to turn\r\n black, and he pronounced her dead, giving a certificate, in which he\r\n assigned apoplexy as the cause. During the night Mrs. Sarseville’s\r\n daughter sat beside the coffin of her mother, lamenting her death.\r\n Just before daybreak she was startled to see the body move. She was\r\n more shocked when her mother opened her eyes and sat bolt upright in\r\n her coffin. The supposed corpse was no less startled than the girl\r\n to find herself dressed in grave-clothes and lying in a coffin. Help\r\n was summoned, and the lady helped out of her narrow bed and into\r\n her ordinary clothes. She took breakfast with the family yesterday\r\n morning, and seemed none the worse for her ghastly experience.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _British Medical Journal_, March 12, 1892, p. 577.\r\n\r\n\r\n “A NARROW ESCAPE FROM PREMATURE BURIAL.\r\n\r\n “The _Temps_ publishes a case of premature burial prevented by the\r\n daughter of the supposed dead man, who, on kissing her father,\r\n perceived that his body was not cold. The funeral _cortége_ was\r\n on the point of starting. Suitable measures restored the man to\r\n consciousness, and he opened his eyes and uttered one or two words.\r\n His condition is serious, but he is alive. This incident occurred at\r\n Vagueray, near Lyons.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Echo_, London, May 13, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n “ALMOST BURIED WHILE ALIVE.\r\n\r\n  “Limoges, May 13.\r\n\r\n “A woman has just had a narrow escape of being buried alive here. She\r\n was subject to epileptic fits, and during one of these a few days ago\r\n was pronounced to be dead. The arrangements for interment were made in\r\n due course, and as the coffin was being borne into the church some of\r\n the mourners said they heard a knocking inside. The party listened,\r\n and distinct taps were heard. No time was lost in wrenching off the\r\n lid of the coffin. It was then found that the woman was alive and\r\n conscious, although terribly frightened at the awful ordeal through\r\n which she had passed. A doctor was quickly in attendance, and under\r\n his direction the supposed corpse was removed from the coffin and\r\n placed on a litter for conveyance home again.”\r\n\r\nThe _Undertakers’ Journal_, July 22, 1893, says:--\r\n\r\n “Charles Walker was supposed to have died suddenly at St. Louis a\r\n few days ago, and a burial certificate was obtained in due course\r\n from the coroner’s office. The body was lying in the coffin, and the\r\n relatives took a farewell look at the features, and withdrew as the\r\n undertaker’s assistants advanced to screw down the lid. One of the\r\n undertaker’s men noticed, however, that the position of the body in\r\n the coffin seemed to have undergone some slight change, and called\r\n attention to the fact. Suddenly, without any warning, the ‘corpse’ sat\r\n up in the coffin and gazed round the room. A physician was summoned,\r\n restoratives were applied, and in half an hour the supposed corpse was\r\n in a warm bed, sipping weak brandy and water, taking a lively interest\r\n in the surroundings. Heart-failure had produced a species of syncope\r\n resembling death that deceived even experts.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Undertakers’ Journal_, August 22, 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n “SNATCHED FROM DEATH AT THE GRAVESIDE.\r\n\r\n “A marvellous case of suspended animation is described from the\r\n British colony of Lagos, where an old woman named Oseni came to\r\n life when she was at the cemetery about to be buried. The mourners\r\n had assembled at the cemetery, and, in accordance with the Mahomedan\r\n rule, the body was lifted from the coffin to be buried, when several\r\n distinct coughs were given by the supposed corpse. She was at once\r\n released from the clothes which bound her, and the old woman, to the\r\n surprise and amazement of those present, sat upright and opened her\r\n eyes.

It seems that, owing to the grave not being in readiness,\r\n some delay occurred in the burial of a lady, the wife of a major in\r\n the army, who to all appearance had died. On the fourth day after\r\n the lady’s supposed death the maid was placing fresh flowers round\r\n the coffin, when she was much startled at seeing the body move, and\r\n finally assume an erect position. The lady had evidently been in a\r\n state of coma during the past four days, and narrowly escaped being\r\n buried alive.”\r\n\r\nThe _Banner of Light_, Boston, July 28, 1894, quotes the following case\r\nof apparent sudden death from the _Boston Post_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “COFFINED ALIVE!\r\n\r\n “Sprakers, a village not far from Rondout, N.Y., was treated to a\r\n sensation Tuesday, July 10, by the supposed resurrection from the dead\r\n of Miss Eleanor Markham, a young woman of respectability, who to all\r\n appearance had died on Sunday, July 8.\r\n\r\n “Miss Markham about a fortnight ago complained of heart trouble, and\r\n was treated by Dr. Howard. She grew weaker gradually, and on Sunday\r\n morning apparently breathed her last, to the great grief of her\r\n relatives, by whom she was much beloved. The doctor pronounced her\r\n dead, and furnished the usual burial certificate.\r\n\r\n “Undertaker Jones took charge of the funeral arrangements. On account\r\n of the warm weather it was decided that the interment should take\r\n place Tuesday, and in the morning Miss Markham was put in the coffin.\r\n\r\n “After her relatives had taken the last look on what they supposed was\r\n their beloved dead, the lid of the coffin was fastened on, and the\r\n undertaker and his assistant took it to the hearse waiting outside.\r\n As they approached the hearse a noise was heard, and the coffin was\r\n put down and opened in short order. Behold! there was poor Eleanor\r\n Markham lying on her back, her face white and contorted, and her eyes\r\n distended.\r\n\r\n “‘My God!’ she cried, in broken accents. ‘Where am I? You are burying\r\n me alive.’ ‘Hush! child,’ said Dr. Howard, who happened to be present.\r\n ‘You are all right. It is a mistake easily rectified.’\r\n\r\n “The girl was then taken into the house and placed on the bed,\r\n when she fainted. While the doctor was administering stimulating\r\n restoratives the trappings of woe were removed, and the hearse drove\r\n away with more cheerful rapidity than a hearse was ever driven before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n “‘I was conscious all the time you were making preparations to bury\r\n me,’ she said, ‘and the horror of my situation is altogether beyond\r\n description. I could hear everything that was going on, even a whisper\r\n outside the door, and although I exerted all my will-power, and made\r\n a supreme physical effort to cry out, I was powerless.... At first I\r\n fancied the bearers would not hear me, but when I felt one end of the\r\n coffin falling suddenly, I knew that I had been heard.’\r\n\r\n “Miss Markham is on a fair way to recovery, and what is strange is\r\n that the flutterings of the heart that brought on her illness are\r\n gone.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Echo_, January 18, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n “MISTAKEN FOR DEAD--A WOMAN’S AWFUL EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\n “An extraordinary affair is reported from Heap Bridge, Heywood.\r\n Yesterday a woman was supposed to have died, and she was washed, laid\r\n out, and measured for her coffin, a piece of linen being placed over\r\n her mouth. Eight hours later, however, as two women were engaged in\r\n the room, the supposed corpse blew the linen away, and raised herself\r\n up in bed. The two women were terribly frightened, and in their hasty\r\n retreat both tumbled downstairs, and are now suffering from slight\r\n injuries, as well as shock. Some time elapsed before any one else\r\n could be induced to enter the house, but eventually several persons\r\n went in together, and found the woman still sitting up in bed. She\r\n was exceedingly weak. Later, however, she succumbed, and the doctor\r\n expressed the opinion that her death was accelerated by shock. During\r\n the night the woman conversed with her son, who had carried her\r\n upstairs for dead, and told him of the awful sensation she felt whilst\r\n unable to speak during the washing and laying out of her body.”\r\n\r\nThe following letter appeared in the London _Daily Chronicle_ of\r\nSeptember 24, 1895:--\r\n\r\n\r\n[A HUSBAND’S PROMISE.]\r\n\r\n “BURIED ALIVE.\r\n\r\n “Sir,--To your interesting correspondence on ‘Buried Alive,’ I would\r\n add the following, which I had directly from the mouth of one who but\r\n for the faithfulness of her husband would probably have been added to\r\n the number. I knew her quite well. She was the daughter of a physician\r\n in my native town, and her husband was a professor of music, and I\r\n will tell the incident as nearly as I can remember in her own words.\r\n She said:--‘I had in my early married life a dread of there being any\r\n mistake made about my death, and begged my husband that, should he\r\n survive me, he would watch my body himself, which he promised he would\r\n do. Some time after this, I was overtaken by a most terrible attack\r\n of fever, succeeded by entire exhaustion, and I, as my attendants\r\n believed, died, and was accordingly laid out for burial. My good\r\n husband was true to his promise, and he, with my sister, watched the\r\n corpse, and in the night they perceived some indication of returning\r\n life, and of course means were used for restoration.’\r\n\r\n “I cannot be quite sure how many years she lived after, but she had\r\n brought up at the time I speak of a family of four sons and one\r\n daughter, and she lived to a good old age.--Yours truly,\r\n\r\n  “CASSANDRA M----.\r\n\r\n “September 18.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the subject of premature burial the other day, a well-known\r\nLondon publisher told the author that he personally knew a lady, the\r\ndaughter of a British Consul, who had been taken for dead on two\r\nseparate occasions. On the first occasion the lady had been placed in\r\nher coffin, and the lid screwed down ready for interment. A friend who\r\nhad known the supposed deceased called to condole with the family,\r\nand said:--“I should like to have a last look at dear L---- if you\r\nwill only permit me.” The lid was accordingly removed, and the visitor\r\ndetected, as it seemed to her, signs of life in her friend; she was\r\ntaken out of her coffin, put in a warm bath, and recovered. Some years\r\nlater the same lady fell into a cataleptic state after a fever, and\r\nwas taken for dead. Preparations had been made for the funeral in\r\nboth instances, but delayed beyond the usual time for interment. She\r\nreturned to consciousness, and is now living.\r\n\r\nDr. Moore Russell Fletcher in “Suspended Animation and the Danger of\r\nBurying Alive,” p. 62, writes:--\r\n\r\n“‘Seven hours in a coffin added ten years to my life,’ was the remark\r\nof Martin Strong, of Twelfth Street, Philadelphia, some time after\r\nquitting the coffin in which his family had placed him for burial,\r\nafter Dr. Cummings had given a certificate of his death. Frank Stoop,\r\nof Clarinda, Iowa, was laid out for burial not long since, a physician\r\nhaving certified to his death; but fortunately he awoke from his state\r\nof coma in time to save his life.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARMY SURGEON’S PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\n[DR. CHEW’S EXPERIENCES.]\r\n\r\nDr. R. G. S. Chew, of Calcutta, writing to the author, says:--“In\r\n1873 I was a student in the Bishop’s High School, Poonah (Bombay\r\nPresidency), where I used to be generally at the head of my class,\r\nand when competing for the Science Prizes I was fully determined to\r\ntake the first prize or none. The Reverend---- Watson, Rector of St.\r\nMary’s Church and Chaplain to our school, knew my disposition, and\r\ncautioned me against being too sanguine, lest disappointment might\r\ntell very keenly. The disappointment came, and with it much nervous\r\nexcitability. Shortly after this (Christmas, 1873) my favourite sister\r\nwas seized with convulsions that carried her off. From the moment of\r\nher decease to nearly a month after her interment I entirely lost the\r\npower of speech. On the day of the funeral I was parched with thirst,\r\nbut could not drink, as the water seemed to choke me. My eyes were\r\nburning and my head felt like bursting, but I could neither sob nor\r\ncry. I felt quite dazed, and followed the procession to the cemetery,\r\nwhere I stood motionless by the open grave; but as soon as they lowered\r\nthe little coffin into its resting-place I threw myself headlong into\r\nthe grave and fainted away. Some one pulled me out and carried me\r\nhome, where I lay in a sort of stupor for nine days, during which Dr.\r\nDonaldson attended me most patiently, and I regained consciousness,\r\nbut was too weak to even sit up in bed. On the 16th January, 1874, I\r\nfelt a peculiar sensation as of something filling up my throat--no\r\nswelling, no pain nor anything that pointed to throat affection--and\r\nthis getting worse and worse, in spite of everything, I _died_, as was\r\nsupposed, on the 18th of January, 1874, and was laid out for burial,\r\nas the most careful examination failed to show the slightest traces of\r\nlife. I had been in this state for twenty hours, and in another three\r\nhours would have been closed up for ever, when my eldest sister, who\r\nwas leaning over the head of my coffin crying over me, declared she\r\nsaw my lips move. The friends who had come to take their last look at\r\nme tried to persuade her it was only fancy, but, as she persisted,\r\nDr. Donaldson was sent for to convince her that I was really dead.\r\nFor some unexplained reason he had me taken out of the coffin and\r\nexamined very carefully from head to foot. Noticing a peculiar, soft\r\nfluctuating swelling at the base of my neck, just where the clavicles\r\nmeet the sternum, he went to his brougham, came back with his case of\r\ninstruments, and, before any one could stop him or ask what he was\r\ngoing to do, laid open the tumour and plunged in a tracheotomy tube,\r\nwhen a quantity of pus escaped, and, releasing the pressure on the\r\ncarotids and thyroid, was followed by a rush of blood and some movement\r\non my part that startled the doctor. Restoratives were used, and I was\r\nslowly nursed back to life; but the tracheotomy tube (I _still_ carry\r\nthe scar) was not finally removed till September, 1875.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“APPARENT DEATH FROM A FALL.\r\n\r\n(_Communicated to the author by Dr. Chew._)\r\n\r\n[APPARENT DEATH FROM A FALL.]\r\n\r\n“A sowar--_i.e._, native trooper--of the 7th regiment of cavalry, in\r\n1878, carrying despatches at Nowshera, was thrown from his horse,\r\nand, falling with his head against a sharp stone in the road, rolled\r\non to his back, in which position he was found some six or seven\r\nhours after, and conveyed to the morgue of the European Depôt Hospital\r\npending removal to the ‘lines’ of his own corps. There was very\r\nlittle hæmorrhage, and the stone was still wedged in between the\r\ntemporo-parietal suture. Cardiac sounds and respiratory murmurs could\r\nnot be detected. The limbs were perfectly rigid, and there was a good\r\ndeal of cadaveric ecchymosis to be distinctly seen. Nothing would have\r\nconvinced any one that the sowar was still alive, and Surgeons-Major\r\nHunter, Gibson, and Briggs, Apothecary S. Pollock, Assistant-Surgeon\r\nJ. Lewis and myself _verily_ believed he was stone-dead. As ‘cause of\r\ndeath’ is what the army is exceedingly particular about, Surgeon-Major\r\nHunter removed the impacted stone and lifted out portions of the\r\nfractured bone (prior to holding a proper _post-mortem_), when to the\r\nsurprise of all of us ‘the corpse’ deliberately closed its eyes (which\r\nwere staring open when the body was first brought in), and there was\r\na slight serous hæmorrhage. On noticing this, the sowar’s head was\r\ntrephined--no chloroform or other anæsthetic being used--some more\r\nfragments of bone and a large blood-clot that pressed on the brain were\r\nremoved, and as the sowar repeatedly flinched under this operation,\r\na stimulant was poured down his throat, and he was removed to his\r\nregimental hospital, from which he was discharged ‘well’ some six\r\nmonths and a half later. After this he did good service in the Afghan\r\nand Egyptian campaigns.”\r\n\r\n“APPARENT DEATH FROM CHOLERA.\r\n\r\n“The cases of collapse and apparent death during epidemics of cholera\r\nare very numerous, as will be seen by reference to medical literature.\r\nWe have now before us particulars of cases from the _Calcutta Journal\r\nof Medicine_ for 1869, vol. ii., p. 383, where Dr. Charles Londe, of\r\nParis, observes that patients pronounced dead of cholera have been\r\nrepeatedly seen to move. See also, for Italy, _Lancet_, 1884, vol. ii.,\r\np. 655.\r\n\r\n“A correspondent, signing himself T.E.N., in _To-Day_, October 12,\r\n1895, says:--‘When acting as special correspondent to the _Evening\r\nHerald_ in Hamburg during the cholera plague, I met a gentleman who\r\nhad been passed for dead and placed in the mortuary to await burial.\r\nWhen the porters entered some hours later to remove the hundred or so\r\nbodies, they found this gentleman sitting up in great pain, and very\r\nmuch frightened. He was placed in a ward and recovered. About the same\r\ntime a little girl came to life actually at the graveside. She had been\r\nbrought in one of several four-horse vans that conveyed bodies for\r\ninterment in the Ohlsdorff grave-yard. Fortunately for her, she had\r\nnot been placed in a coffin, the exigencies of the time rendering it\r\nimpossible to provide caskets for the dead. When the disease began to\r\ndie out, the people found time to ask--“Can it be possible that life\r\nremains in any of the bodies buried?” That the doctors in the latter\r\ndays cut the ulnar arteries of all subjects before passing them for\r\ndead is full of significance.’”\r\n\r\n[CASES COMMUNICATED BY DR. CHEW.]\r\n\r\nThe three following cases were communicated to the author, during\r\nhis sojourn in Calcutta, by Dr. Chew, in the early part of this year\r\n(1896):--\r\n\r\n“In March, 1877, Assistant-Surgeons H. A. Borthwick, S. Blake, H. B.\r\nRogers, and myself received orders to proceed from Rawal Pindi by\r\nbullock-train to Peshawur to join the various regiments we were to\r\nbe posted to for duty. We had just passed a place called Rati when\r\nBorthwick showed strong symptoms of cholera, from which he suffered\r\nall that night. The nearest hospital was twenty-five miles behind us,\r\nand though we had neither medicines nor sick-room comforts with us, we\r\nhad no alternative but to journey onwards, because the train-drivers\r\n(Indians) refused to turn back, and if we did return to Rawal Pindi we\r\nwould have been court-martialled for disobeying lawful commands and\r\ncoming back without orders to do so. Travelling by bullock-train is\r\nvery slow work, and far from a comfortable mode of transit; however,\r\nwe were obliged to make the best of it, and early next morning\r\nBorthwick was cold, stiff, and seemingly dead. Here was a fine state\r\nof affairs--the nearest cantonment, which we had no expectation of\r\nreaching (_i.e._, Nowshera) before nine p.m., was thirty-six miles\r\noff, and by the time we arrived at it, it would have been too late to\r\napproach the authorities, while Peshawur, our destination, was another\r\ntwenty-nine miles further off. Dispose of the body we dared not, and we\r\nhad no choice but to continue our route. All that day there was not a\r\nmovement or other sign to show that life was not extinct, and affairs\r\nseemed no better by five p.m. next day, when we reached Peshawur. The\r\napparent corpse was lifted out of the bullock-train and carried into\r\nthe hospital dispensary (where a strong fire was blazing) preparatory\r\nto papers being signed and arrangements made for its final disposal.\r\nWhether it was the heat of the fire before which he was placed, or\r\nwhether the vibriones had produced an antitoxin, I am not prepared to\r\nargue; but _we do know_ that Borthwick recovered consciousness while\r\nlying on the bed in that dispensary, and that he whom we mourned as\r\ndead returned to life. He served in the same military stations with me\r\nin the North-West Frontier till 1880, when he accompanied me to the\r\nCalcutta Medical College, where we parted company in February, 1882,\r\nI bound for Egypt and he for frontier duty. At first we corresponded\r\nregularly, but since 1885 we lost touch of each other.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“REVIVAL IN A MORTUARY IN INDIA.\r\n\r\n“Sergeant J. Clements Twining, of H.M.’s 109th regiment of British\r\ninfantry, located at Dinapoor in 1876, was brought in an unconscious\r\nstate to the hospital, supposed to be suffering from _coup de soleil_.\r\nEverything that could be done was ineffectually tried to rouse him from\r\ncoma, and he was removed to the dead-house to wait _post-mortem_ next\r\nmorning. At two a.m. the sentry on the dead-house came rushing down\r\nto the dispensary (about four hundred and fifty yards off) declaring\r\nthat he had seen and heard a ghost in the dead-house, to which myself\r\nand the compounder and dresser on duty at once proceeded, to find that\r\nClements Twining, who was now partially conscious, was lying on the\r\ndead-house flags groaning most piteously--he had rolled off the table\r\non to the floor. He returned to health, and in 1877 accompanied his\r\nregiment to England, where I met him at Woolwich in 1883, and he asked\r\nme to corroborate his story of ‘returning to life’ to certain of his\r\nacquaintances who had refused to believe him.”\r\n\r\n[THE USE OF MORTUARIES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“CHOLERA CORPSES REVIVED IN A MORTUARY.\r\n\r\n“When the East Norfolk regiment was out cholera-dodging in 1878,\r\nColour-Sergeant T. Hall and Corporal W. Bellomy were sent into\r\ncantonments for burial as cholera corpses in the Nowshera Cemetery.\r\nThere was some delay in the interment owing to a difficulty in\r\nobtaining the wood necessary for their coffins, so both bodies\r\nwere placed in the dead-house, which was generously sprinkled with\r\ndisinfectants to ward off the risk of contagion. First Hall and then\r\nBellomy regained consciousness, and were duly returned to duty. The\r\nfollowing year Bellomy was ‘invalided’ to England, where I understand\r\nhe now enjoys the best of health.”\r\n\r\n“Shortly after the Afghan war of 1878, Surgeon-Major T. Barnwell and\r\nI were told off to take a large number of time-expired men, invalids,\r\nand wounded, to Deolali on their way to England. Some of the wounded\r\nwere in a very critical state, necessitating great care; one man\r\nin particular, Trooper Holmes of the 10th Hussars, who had an ugly\r\nbullet-wound running along his left thigh and under the groin. Our only\r\nmeans of transport for these poor fellows was the ‘palki’ or doolie\r\ncarried by four bearers at a curious swinging pace. When we got to\r\nNowshera, Holmes seemed on a fair way to recovery, but the swinging\r\nof the doolie seemed too much for him, and he grew weaker day by day\r\ntill we got to Hassan Abdool, when we could not rouse him to take\r\nsome nourishment before starting on the march, and to all appearance\r\nhe seemed perfectly dead; but, as there was neither the time nor\r\nconvenience to hold a _post-mortem_, we carried the body on to ‘John\r\nNicholson,’ where, the same difficulties being in the way, and no\r\nfacilities for burial, we were obliged to put the _post-mortem_ off for\r\nanother day, and convey the corpse to Rawal Pindi rest camp, where we\r\nlaid him on the floor of the mortuary tent and covered him over with a\r\ntarpaulin. This was his salvation, as next morning (_i.e._, the third\r\nday succeeding his ‘death’), when we raised the tarpaulin to hold the\r\n_post-mortem_, some hundreds of field mice (these tracts are _noted_\r\nfor them) rushed out, and we noticed that Holmes was breathing, though\r\nvery slowly--five or six respirations to the minute--and there were a\r\nfew teeth marks where the mice had attacked his calves. To prevent a\r\nrelapse by the jolting on further marches, we handed him over to the\r\nstation hospital staff, who pulled him round, and then forwarded him to\r\nthe headquarters of his regiment at Meerut.”\r\n\r\nA lady, distinguished alike for her literary gifts as well as for her\r\nphilanthropy, sends me the following:--\r\n\r\n“I am much obliged to you for sending me ‘Perils.’ It is a terrible\r\nsubject, and one that has haunted me all my life, insomuch that I have\r\nnever made a will without inserting a clause requiring my throat to be\r\ncut before I am put underground. Of course one can have no reliance\r\non doctors whatever, and I have myself known a case in which a very\r\neminent one insisted on a coffin being screwed down because the corpse\r\nlooked so life-like and full of colour that the friends could not help\r\nindulging in hopes.\r\n\r\n[CASES IN IRELAND.]\r\n\r\n“My great grandmother, after whom I am called, a famous heiress, was\r\na notable case of narrow escape. As a girl she passed into a state of\r\napparent death, and a great funeral was ordered for her. Among the\r\nguests came a young girl friend, who insisted that she was not dead,\r\nand raised such a stir that the funeral was postponed, and time was\r\nallowed to pass till the marvel became that there were no signs of\r\nchange. I could never ascertain how long this comatose state lasted\r\nbefore she recovered; but she _did_ recover, so thoroughly that after\r\nher marriage with Richard Trench, of Garbuly, she became the mother\r\nof twenty-two children. Obviously this was no case of a feeble,\r\nhysterical, cataleptic subject. I will enclose photograph taken from a\r\nminiature of her in a ring in my possession.\r\n\r\n“There was another case, well known in Ireland in my youth, of a\r\nColonel Howard, who had a fine place (I think it was called Castle\r\nHoward) in Wicklow. He was supposed to be dead, and a lead coffin\r\nwas actually made with his name and date of death on it; after which\r\nColonel Howard came to life, and had the plate of the coffin fixed over\r\nhis kitchen chimney as a warning to his servants not to bury people in\r\na hurry.”\r\n\r\nDr. Colin S. Valentine, LL.D., Principal of the Medical Missionary\r\nTraining College, Agra, N.W.P., told the author during his visit to\r\nAgra, February, 1896, that Captain Young, an officer in the regiment of\r\nwhich he (Dr. Valentine) was at that time army surgeon, who had been\r\ndreadfully mauled while tiger-hunting in Madras, was laid out for dead,\r\nand all the arrangements were made for his funeral at six o’clock that\r\nevening, when consciousness returned, and he lived for twenty years\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nIn a lecture on “Signs of Death and Disposal of the Dead,” delivered by\r\nDr. A. Stephenson at Nottingham, January 9, 1896, the lecturer said “he\r\nonce attended a girl living in that locality who was in a trance. All\r\nthe preparations were made for her funeral, and the grave ordered. She\r\nremained in a trance three days, and her mother was annoyed because he\r\nwould not sign her death-certificate. On the third day she slowly rose\r\nand recovered. The girl would have been buried unless he had had a very\r\ngreat fear of her being buried alive.”[6]\r\n\r\nFrom the London _Echo_, March 3, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n “NARROW ESCAPE OF A GREEK-ORTHODOX METROPOLITAN.\r\n\r\n “A letter from Constantinople, in the _Politische Korrespondenz_,\r\n gives a remarkable case of an apparent death which would have ended\r\n in a premature burial but for the high ecclesiastical position of the\r\n person concerned. On the 3rd of this month, Nicephorus Glycas, the\r\n Greek-Orthodox Metropolitan of Lesbos, an old man in his eightieth\r\n year, after several days of confinement to his bed, was reported by\r\n the physician to be dead. The supposed dead bishop, in accordance\r\n with the rules of the Orthodox Church, was immediately clothed in\r\n his episcopal vestments, and placed upon the Metropolitan’s throne\r\n in the great church of Methymni, where the body was exposed to the\r\n devout faithful during the day, and watched by relays of priests day\r\n and night. Crowds streamed into the church to take a last look at\r\n their venerable chief pastor. On the second night of “the exposition\r\n of the corpse,” the Metropolitan suddenly started up from his seat\r\n and stared round him with amazement and horror at all the panoply\r\n of death amidst which he had been seated. The priests were not less\r\n horrified when the ‘dead’ bishop demanded what they were doing with\r\n him? The old man had simply fallen into a death-like lethargy, which\r\n the incompetent doctors had hastily concluded to be death. He is now\r\n as hale and hearty as can well be expected from an octogenarian. But\r\n here it is that the moral comes in. If Nicephorus Glycas had been a\r\n layman he would most certainly have been buried alive. Fortunately for\r\n him the Canon Law of the Orthodox Church does not allow a bishop to be\r\n buried earlier than the third day after his death; whereas a layman,\r\n according to the ancient Eastern custom, is generally buried about\r\n twelve hours after death has been certified. The excitement which has\r\n been aroused by the prelate’s startling resurrection may tend to set\r\n men thinking more seriously about the frequent probability of the\r\n cruel horror of the interment of living persons.”\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned facts have been authenticated for the author by Dr.\r\nFranz Hartmann, of Hallein, Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARROW ESCAPES OF SMALL-POX PATIENTS.\r\n\r\nMany physicians who dispute the frequency of premature burials admit\r\nthat the liability to such catastrophes is considerable during\r\nepidemics of small-pox, where extreme exhaustion, amounting to a\r\nsuspension of life, is distinguishable from actual death only by\r\npatient and prolonged observation.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lancet_, June 21, 1884, p. 1150:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “SUSPENDED ANIMATION AFTER SMALL-POX.\r\n\r\n “Sir,--I send you privately names and addresses by means of which you\r\n can test, if you please, the accuracy of the following statements,\r\n which I forward for insertion in your journal:--\r\n\r\n[APPARENT DEATHS AFTER SMALL-POX.]\r\n\r\n “Some years since, a young man who had been attacked by small-pox\r\n was declared by the medical man to be dead, and was laid out for\r\n burial. The nurse, however, on paying a visit to the supposed corpse,\r\n thinking there was something uncorpse-like about its appearance, put\r\n a wine-glass over the mouth, and returning in a quarter of an hour,\r\n found it dimmed with breath. He was resuscitated, and, so far as I\r\n am aware, is still living. He would now be about forty-five. He is a\r\n farmer.\r\n\r\n “A mother and her baby were ill of small-pox, and seemed likely to\r\n die. The grandmother, however, made the nurse promise that if death\r\n appeared to ensue, and even if the medical man pronounced either or\r\n both to be dead, she would put additional blankets on the one or\r\n both, and leave them so till her (the grandmother’s) return, which\r\n would not be till the next day. They both appeared to die, and were\r\n declared dead by the doctor; but the nurse did as she had promised,\r\n and the next day when the grandmother returned, they were both alive,\r\n and were both living not very long since.\r\n\r\n “Some twenty years ago, I was told that about forty years previously\r\n a young man, in a parish where I was acquainted, was put in a coffin\r\n as a person dead of small-pox; but when the bell was tolling for his\r\n funeral, and he was about to be ‘screwed down,’ he got up and vacated\r\n the coffin, and lived several years afterwards.\r\n\r\n “In a town where I was brought up, a woman was nearly buried alive\r\n through having gone into a trance on being frightened by a young lady\r\n who had put on a white sheet and pretended to be a ‘ghost.’ For years\r\n she was liable to long spells of insensibility, from which nothing\r\n could rouse her.\r\n\r\n “The haste with which small-pox corpses are disposed of nowadays is to\r\n be deprecated. They are usually buried within twelve hours of their\r\n supposed death, and the cases I first mentioned show with what very\r\n probable results. The only sure proof of death is decomposition, and\r\n a law ought to be passed forbidding burial until signs of it have\r\n appeared. Not very long since I was in a church-yard where a drain\r\n was being made round the church, and was not a little struck by the\r\n horrified look of a labourer who came to the vicar and stated that\r\n they had come on a skull face downward, which, he said, put it beyond\r\n doubt that the person it had belonged to had turned in his coffin\r\n after burial.--I am, Sir, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n  “B. A.\r\n\r\n “June 18, 1884.”\r\n\r\nThe _Undertakers’ Journal_, May 22, 1895, has the following:--\r\n\r\n[REV. HARRY JONES’ CASES.]\r\n\r\n “The Reverend Harry Jones, in his reminiscences, and as a London\r\n clergyman, declares his conviction that in times of panic from fatal\r\n epidemics it is not unlikely that some people are buried alive.\r\n Mr. Jones recalls a case within his knowledge of a young woman\r\n pronounced to be dead from cholera, and actually laid out for the\r\n usual collecting cart to call from the undertakers, when a neighbour\r\n happened to come in and lament over her. The story continues thus:\r\n ‘And is poor Sarah really dead?’ she cried. ‘Well,’ said her mother,\r\n ‘she is, and she will soon be fetched away; but if you can do anything\r\n you may do it.’ Acting on this permission the practical neighbour set\r\n about rubbing Sarah profusely with mustard. Sarah sat up, stung into\r\n renovated life, and so far recovered as to marry; ‘and I myself,’ says\r\n Mr. Jones, ‘christened four or five of her children in the course of\r\n the next few years.’ In another case, within Mr. Jones’ parochial\r\n experiences in London, a man employed as potman lay _in extremis_. A\r\n doctor was called in, who said ‘Turn him on his face, and I will put\r\n a thick strip of flannel soaked in spirits of wine down his spine. We\r\n will see what that will do.’ A sister brought a store of flannel, the\r\n doctor soaked it in spirit, and prepared to apply it as he proposed.\r\n First, however, he placed the soaking mass in a heap (almost as big as\r\n a small hassock) in the middle of his back. Meanwhile the sister leant\r\n forward with a candle and accidently set the hassock on fire. ‘This,’\r\n adds the anecdotist, ‘woke the potman up;’ and not very long ago the\r\n doctor told me he had seen him in a street near the Oxford Circus.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Daily Chronicle_, September 19, 1895.\r\n\r\n “Sir,--I infer from the following facts that numbers of persons are\r\n buried alive after being supposed to have succumbed to small-pox.\r\n\r\n “Some years ago, at St. Paul’s, Belchamp, near Clare, a young man who\r\n had been down with the small-pox was pronounced to be dead, and was\r\n put into a coffin, which, fortunately, was left unclosed until after\r\n the bell began to toll for his funeral, when he rose and stepped out.\r\n He lived for many years after. In the same neighbourhood no less\r\n than three other similar cases occurred, saving that the undertakers\r\n were not so far forward in their work. Each of these would have been\r\n buried alive but for the facts that in one case the nurse, having\r\n suspicions, put a wine-glass over the mouth of the person (who had\r\n been already ‘laid out’), and on returning in a quarter of an hour\r\n found it dimmed with breath; and that in the other case the mother\r\n of a mother, who with her baby was declared by the doctor to be dead,\r\n had blankets heaped on them, and after a while had the satisfaction of\r\n seeing them revive. Two of these three persons are, I believe, still\r\n living, and would be just past middle-age. I enclose their names for\r\n your private perusal, that you may verify my statements if desired.\r\n The first-mentioned case happened about seventy years ago, but I heard\r\n of it from residents in the neighbourhood about forty years after it\r\n occurred.\r\n\r\n “Nowadays as soon as a small-pox patient is supposed to be dead, he\r\n or she is enclosed in a coffin and hurried off to the church-yard or\r\n cemetery the ensuing night--at least this is the practice in country\r\n places. I have no doubt that many have been buried alive.--Yours\r\n faithfully,\r\n\r\n  “EX-CURATE.\r\n\r\n “September 18.”\r\n\r\nBrigade-Surgeon W. Curran cites from the _Revue des Deux Mondes_,\r\nApril, 1873, in his Eighth Paper, entitled “Buried Alive,” as follows:--\r\n\r\n[IMPORTANCE OF CAREFUL EXAMINATION.]\r\n\r\n“On the 15th of October, 1842, a farmer who lived in the suburbs of\r\nNeufchâtel (Lower Seine) went to sleep in his hay-loft in the midst of\r\nsome newly mown hay. As he did not get up at the usual hour the next\r\nmorning, his wife went to call him, and found him dead. When the time\r\nfor his funeral arrived, some twenty-four or thirty hours subsequently,\r\nthose who were charged with the burial put the body on a bier, and\r\nhaving placed this on the ladder that communicated between the ground\r\nand the loft, they allowed it to slide down. All of a sudden one of\r\nthe rungs of this ladder gave way, and the bier, falling through, was\r\ndashed violently on the pavement below. The shock, which might have\r\nbeen fatal to a live person, proved to be the ‘saving clause’ of our\r\nsupposed dead one; and fortunately, too, the attendants had not, as\r\nso commonly happens in such contingencies, absconded; on the contrary,\r\nresponding without delay to the requirements of the situation, they\r\nquickly realised the gravity of the crisis, and, unbinding the shrouds\r\nof the farmer, they soon restored him to consciousness and life. He was\r\nable, we are further told, to resume his ordinary duties in a few days\r\nafterwards.”[7]\r\n\r\nThe _Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal_, January 22, 1889,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n“Mr. J. W. Smith, of 158 River Avenue, Alleghany” has just had, for\r\ninstance, a remarkably narrow escape of prematurely putting his family\r\nin mourning, and one which will, we may be sure, be a very disagreeable\r\nrecollection for him during the rest of his existence. After a visit to\r\nthe Pittsburg Opera House one night, Mr. Smith was found lying ‘stiff\r\nand cold’ behind the stove in the dining-room, and apparently dead. A\r\nsuperficial examination by Dr. M’Cready confirmed the worst fears of\r\nMrs. Smith, but subsequently the doctor sought carefully for any little\r\nspark of life which might lurk unseen, and, very fortunately for Mr.\r\nSmith, found it. But, beyond that, nothing could be accomplished; no\r\neffort to restore animation produced the slightest effect. Two other\r\nphysicians were then summoned; but neither attempts at bleeding, the\r\nuse of ‘mustard baths,’ nor the application of electricity, could\r\nrouse Mr. Smith after his visit to the opera. For three weeks he lay\r\ninsensible, and when he regained consciousness a fever followed. This\r\nevent, and some others of a similar character which are occasionally\r\nheard of, show that the examination of persons apparently dead should\r\nalways be undertaken by an efficient person, and by no means in a\r\nperfunctory manner.”\r\n\r\nThe late Madame Blavatsky was subject to death-like trances, and Dr.\r\nFranz Hartmann informs me that she would have been buried alive if\r\nColonel Olcott had not telegraphed to let her have time to awaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFORMALITIES AND THEIR FATAL CONSEQUENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHENEVER grave-yards have been removed, owing to the rapid expansion\r\nof towns, in America, or examined elsewhere, unmistakable evidences of\r\npremature burial have been disclosed, as will be seen in this volume;\r\nbodies have been found turned upon their faces, the limbs contorted,\r\nwith hair dishevelled, the clothing torn, the flesh mutilated, and\r\ncoffins broken by the inmates in their mad endeavour to escape after\r\nreturning consciousness, to terminate life only in unspeakable mental\r\nand physical agonies. It may be said that every grave-yard has its\r\ntraditions, but the facts are carefully concealed lest they should\r\nreach the ears of the relatives, or incriminate the doctors who had\r\nwith such confidence certified to actual deaths which were only\r\napparent. It is not, however, the custom to remove grave-yards in\r\nEurope until all possibility of such discoveries has disappeared.\r\nTo reopen a grave is to break the seal of domestic grief. There\r\nis a widespread belief that where a coffin, with a duly certified\r\ncorpse,--dead or alive,--has been screwed up, it must not be opened\r\nwithout an authorisation from a magistrate, mayor, or other official,\r\nand many people have been suffocated in their coffins while waiting\r\nfor this formality. Common sense, under the circumstances, seems to be\r\noften paralysed.\r\n\r\nIn England it has been decided, Reg. _v._ Sharpe (1 Dearsley and Bell,\r\n160), to be a misdemeanour to disinter a body without lawful authority,\r\neven where the motive of the offender was pious and laudable; and a\r\ntoo rigorous interpretation of this and similar enactments in other\r\ncountries has led to the suffocation of many unfortunate victims of a\r\nmistaken medical diagnosis, whose lives, by prompt interposition, might\r\nhave been saved.\r\n\r\nKöppen, in his work, entitled “Information Relative to Persons who have\r\nbeen Buried Alive,” Halle, 1799, dedicated to His Majesty the King of\r\nPrussia, Frederick William III., quotes the following amongst a large\r\nnumber of cases of premature burial:--“In D----, the Baroness F----\r\ndied of small-pox. She was kept in her house three days, and then put\r\nin the family vault. After a time, a noise of knocking was heard in the\r\nvault, and the voice of the Baroness was also heard. The authorities\r\nwere informed; and instead of opening the door with an axe, as could\r\nhave been done, the key was sent for, which took three or four hours\r\nbefore the messenger returned with it. On opening the vault it was\r\nfound that the lady was lying on her side, with evidences of having\r\nsuffered terrible agony.”\r\n\r\n[A MAGISTRATE CENSURED.]\r\n\r\nStruve, in his essay on “Suspended Animation,” 1803, p. 71, relates\r\nthe following:--“A beggar arrived late at night, and almost frozen\r\nto death, at a German village, and, observing a school-house open,\r\nresolved to sleep there. The next morning, the school-boys found the\r\npoor man sitting motionless in the room, and hastened, affrighted,\r\nto inform the schoolmaster of what they had seen. The villagers,\r\nsupposing the beggar to be dead, interred him in the evening. During\r\nthe night, the watchman heard a knocking in the grave, accompanied by\r\nlamentations. He gave information to the bailiff of the village, who\r\ndeclined to listen to his tale. Soon afterwards the watchman returned\r\nto the grave, and again heard a hollow noise, interrupted by sighs.\r\nHe once more hastened to the magistrate, earnestly soliciting him to\r\ncause the grave to be opened; but the latter, being irresolute, delayed\r\nthis measure till the next morning, when he applied to the sheriff, who\r\nlived at a distance from the village, in order to obtain the necessary\r\ndirections. He was, however, obliged to wait some time before an\r\ninterview took place. The more judicious sheriff severely censured the\r\nmagistrate for not having opened the grave on the information from the\r\nwatchman, and desired him to return and cause it to be opened without\r\ndelay. On his arrival, the grave was immediately opened; but, just\r\nHeaven! what a sight! The poor, wretched man, after having recovered in\r\nthe grave, had expired for want of air. In his anguish and desperation\r\nhe had torn the flesh from his arms. All the spectators were struck\r\nwith horror at this dreadful scene.”\r\n\r\nThe _Undertakers’ Journal_, November 22, 1880, relates the following:--\r\n\r\n “An extraordinary story is reported from Tredegar, South Wales. A\r\n man was buried at Cefn Golan Cemetery, and it is alleged that some\r\n of those who took part in carrying the body to the burial-ground\r\n heard knocking inside the coffin. No notice was taken of the affair\r\n at the time, but it has now come up again, and the rumour has caused\r\n a painful sensation throughout the district. It is stated that\r\n application has been made to the Home Secretary for permission to\r\n exhume the body.”\r\n\r\nDr. Franz Hartmann, in his “Premature Burial,” pp. 10 and 44, relates\r\nthe two following cases:--“In the year 1856 a man died in an Hungarian\r\nvillage. It is customary there to dig the graves in rows. As the\r\ngrave-digger was making the new grave he heard sounds as of knocking\r\nproceeding from a grave where a man had been buried a few days\r\npreviously. Terrified, he went to the priest, and with the priest to\r\nthe police. At last permission was granted to open the grave; but by\r\nthat time its occupant had died in reality. The fact that he had been\r\nburied alive was made evident by the condition of the body, and by the\r\nwounds which the man had inflicted upon himself by biting his shoulders\r\nand arms.\r\n\r\n“In a small town in Prussia, an undertaker, living within the limits\r\nof the cemetery, heard during the night cries proceeding from within a\r\ngrave in which a person had been buried on the previous day. Not daring\r\nto interfere without permission, he went to the police and reported the\r\nmatter. When, after a great deal of delay, the required formalities\r\nwere fulfilled and permission granted to open the grave, it was found\r\nthat the man had been buried alive, but that he was now dead. His\r\nbody, which had been cold at the time of the funeral, was now warm and\r\nbleeding from many wounds, where he had skinned his hands and head in\r\nhis struggles to free himself before suffocation made an end to his\r\nmisery.”\r\n\r\nA medical correspondent communicates to the author particulars of the\r\nfollowing case, which occurred at Salzburg, Austria:--“Some children\r\nwere playing in the Luzergasse Cemetery, and their attention was\r\nattracted by knocking sounds in a newly-made grave. They informed the\r\ngrave-digger of it, and he secured permission to open the grave from\r\nwhence the sounds seemed to come. A man had been buried there at two\r\np.m. that day. The formalities of the permission to open the grave\r\ndelayed it till seven p.m., when, on opening the coffin, the body\r\nwas found to be bent completely over forwards, and was frightfully\r\ndistorted and bleeding from places on the hands and arms, which seemed\r\nto have been gnawed by the man’s own teeth. The medical experts who\r\nwere called in to examine the case declared that the man had been\r\nburied alive.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the _Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal_, January 22,\r\n1887.\r\n\r\n[FATAL RESULTS.]\r\n\r\n “Another shocking case of premature burial is reported; the distressing\r\n incident took place at Saumur, in France. A young man suddenly died, at\r\n least to all appearance, and his burial was ordered to take place as\r\n soon as possible. The _croquemorts_, or undertaker’s men, who carried\r\n the coffin to the grave, thought they heard a noise like knocking under\r\n its lid, yet, being afraid of creating a panic among the people who\r\n attended the funeral, they went on with their burden. The coffin was\r\n duly placed in the grave, but, as the earth was being thrown upon it,\r\n unmistakable sounds of knocking were heard by everybody. The mayor,\r\n however, had to be sent for before the coffin could be opened, and\r\n some delay occurred in the arrival of that official. When the lid was\r\n removed, the horrible discovery was made that the unfortunate inmate\r\n had only just died from asphyxia. The conviction is spreading that the\r\n terrible French law requiring speedy interment ought to be modified\r\n without delay.”\r\n\r\nMr. William Harbutt, School of Art, Bath, writes to me, November 27,\r\n1895:--“The copies of the pamphlet ‘The Perils of Premature Burial,’\r\nby Professor Alex. Wilder, you kindly sent me are in circulation.\r\nAlmost every one to whom I mention the subject knows some instances.\r\nOne, a case at Radstock, twelve miles from Bath, where the bearers at\r\nthe funeral heard noises inside the coffin, but were afraid to open it\r\nwithout the authority from a magistrate. When it was opened next day\r\nthe appearance of the body showed that he had been coffined alive, and\r\nhad had a terrible struggle to escape.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Star_, London, May 13, 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n “A WOMAN LOSES HER LIFE THROUGH LEGAL FORMALITIES.\r\n\r\n  “Paris, May 11.\r\n\r\n “A woman who was believed to have died the day before was being buried\r\n at Doussard, when the grave-digger, who was engaged in filling up the\r\n grave, distinctly heard knocking coming from the coffin. He called\r\n a man who was working near, and he came and listened, and heard the\r\n knocking also. It was then about nine o’clock in the morning. The\r\n knocking continued, and they listened for about half an hour, when it\r\n occurred to one of them that they ought to do something, so they went\r\n to inform the local authorities. The curé of the village was the first\r\n to arrive on the scene; but as no one had any authority to exhume the\r\n body the coffin was not taken up. All that was done was to bore some\r\n holes in the lid with a drill in such a way as to admit of air. By\r\n mid-day all the necessary formalities had been gone through, and it\r\n was decided at last to open the coffin. This was done; but whether\r\n the unfortunate woman was still alive at this time is doubtful. Some\r\n of those present affirm that she was. They state that they saw a\r\n little colour come into her cheeks, and the eyes open and shut. One\r\n thing is certain--viz.: that when at half-past six in the evening it\r\n was finally decided to consult a doctor, the practitioner summoned\r\n declared that death had taken place not more than five or six hours\r\n before. It was thought that had the coffin been opened directly the\r\n sounds were heard the woman’s life might have been saved, and she\r\n would have been spared hours of indescribable torture and suffering.”\r\n\r\nThe Paris edition of the _New York Herald_, May 14, 1895, says:--\r\n\r\n “The case of the woman buried alive at Annecy, in the Haute-Savoie,\r\n the other day, has almost found a pendant at Limoges. A woman,\r\n belonging to the village of Laterie, died, to all appearance at least,\r\n a few days ago. After the body had been placed in a coffin, it was\r\n transported to the village church. On the way the bearers heard sounds\r\n proceeding from it, and at once sent for the mayor, who ordered it to\r\n be opened. The woman was found to be suffering from _eclampsia_, which\r\n had been mistaken for death by her relatives.”\r\n\r\nThe following case is instructive in that the victim was exhumed\r\nwithout an order from the Home Secretary, or waiting for any\r\nformalities, and was restored to life:--\r\n\r\n  “BURYING ALIVE.\r\n\r\n  [From the _Spectator_, October 19, 1895.]\r\n\r\n[RESUSCITATION IN IRELAND.]\r\n\r\n “Sir,--_Apropos_ of your article and the correspondence about being\r\n buried alive, in the _Spectator_ of September 28, the enclosed may\r\n interest you. It is an extract which I have copied to-day out of a\r\n letter to a neighbour of mine from his brother in Ireland, dated\r\n October 6, 1895:--‘About three weeks ago, our kitchen-maid asked leave\r\n to go away for two or three days to see her mother, who was dying.\r\n She came back again on a Friday or Saturday, saying her mother was\r\n dead and buried. On Wednesday she got a letter saying her mother had\r\n been dug up, and was alive and getting all right. So she went up to\r\n see her, and sure enough there she was “right enough,” as G---- says,\r\n having got out of her trance, and knowing nothing about being in her\r\n grave from Saturday till Tuesday. The only thing she missed was her\r\n _rings_; she could not make out where they had got to. Her daughter,\r\n it seems, told the doctor on her way back here that it struck her that\r\n her mother had never got stiff after death, and she could not help\r\n thinking it was very odd; and it made her very uncomfortable. He\r\n never said a word: and the kitchen-maid heard nothing until she got\r\n the letter saying her mother was back again and alive. Luckily, she\r\n did not “come to” until she had been taken out of her coffin. It was\r\n a “rum go” altogether. They say exactly the same thing happened to a\r\n sister of hers who is now alive and well.’--I am, Sir, etc.,\r\n\r\n  “PEVERIL TURNBULL.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPROBABLE CASES OF PREMATURE BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE is a great and natural reluctance on the part of medical\r\npractitioners to admit that they have made mistakes in\r\ndeath-certification, particularly in any one of the various forms\r\nof death counterfeits, or suspended animation. It should be noted\r\nthat amongst the lectures delivered on special occasions, such as\r\nthe opening of the medical schools, the subjects of trance and the\r\ndanger of premature burial are conspicuous for their absence; allusion\r\nto these subjects is of rare occurrence, nor does the study of this\r\nabstruse branch of medicine, so far as can be ascertained, form part\r\nof any medical curriculum. In the bibliography at the end of this\r\nvolume, extensive as it is, I can hardly refer to a single instance.\r\nDr. Franz Hartmann, whose work on “Buried Alive” has passed through two\r\nEnglish and one German edition, informs me that the same reticence is\r\nobservable in the medical schools of Germany. Many medical men do not\r\nbelieve in death-trance. They declare that they have never seen such a\r\ncase, and in their judgment when a sick patient ceases to breathe, when\r\nvolition is suspended, and the stethoscope reveals no signs of cardiac\r\naction, the death is real, and the case beyond recovery. The evidence\r\ndisclosed in this volume is the result of inquiry in many countries.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Medical Times_, London, 1860, vol. i., p. 65.\r\n\r\n “A lady entering upon the ninth month of pregnancy died of pneumonia.\r\n All the other phenomena of death ensued, except that the colour of the\r\n face was unusually life-like. On the fifteenth day from that of death\r\n there was not the least cadaveric odour from the corpse, nor had its\r\n appearance much altered, and it was only on the sixteenth day that the\r\n lips darkened. The temperature of the atmosphere had undergone many\r\n changes during the time mentioned, but although there had been frost\r\n for a short period, the weather was in general damp and cold.”\r\n\r\n[NEIGHBOURS’ INTERFERENCE.]\r\n\r\nThis lady might not have been dead. The burial laws should have been\r\nsuch as to make it certain that she was dead before interment, by\r\nthe appearance of general decomposition. The examination of facts\r\ncollected by well-known physicians at home leads to the conclusion that\r\ncases of narrow escapes from premature burial are by no means of rare\r\noccurrence. And it must be obvious to the least reflective reader that\r\nin countries where burial follows quickly upon supposed death (as in\r\nTurkey and France, some parts of Ireland, and throughout India), or\r\nwhere there is no compulsory examination of the dead (as in the United\r\nStates or the United Kingdom), and amongst people like the Jews (since\r\nthe Jewish Law enjoins speedy interment), and especially in cases of\r\nsudden death (where attempts at resuscitation are rare), the number of\r\npremature burials may be considerable.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, while there is no law, as in France, enforcing\r\nburial within a prescribed number of days, it is the custom of civil\r\nauthorities, under regulations made by the Boards of Health, to compel\r\ninterments if delayed by reason of doubt as to actual death beyond a\r\nfew days.\r\n\r\nParticulars of the following case were sent me by a physician, January\r\n17, 1894:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “WAS SHE ALIVE?\r\n\r\n “Mrs. John Emmons, of North Judson, Ind., was taken suddenly ill and\r\n apparently died, a week ago. Her husband desired to keep the body for\r\n a few days, to make sure of death. It seems that her mother went into\r\n a trance for four days, rallied, and lived five years; also that her\r\n grandfather on her mother’s side, after having been pronounced dead\r\n for six days, awoke, and lived for twenty-three years. Mrs. Emmons’s\r\n body was kept until Saturday, when, on the demand of the physician and\r\n numerous residents, it was interred. During the time between Monday\r\n and Saturday the body did not become rigid. Mortification did not set\r\n in, and she was laid to rest without waiting for that, the surest of\r\n all tests, to take place. Many are of the opinion that the woman has\r\n been buried alive.”\r\n\r\nThere are many cases like the above on record, in which, although there\r\nis no absolute proof of premature burial, there is strong presumptive\r\nevidence of it. The following from _Truth_ (London) of May 23, 1895, is\r\nan example, and the writer has heard of many others:--\r\n\r\n “The other day I gave a story showing the difficulty of obtaining a\r\n _post-mortem_ examination after a doctor has once certified the cause\r\n of death. One of my readers caps it with a gruesome narrative, of\r\n which this is the outline: A man lately died in London. The coffin\r\n had to be removed by rail, and was to be closed on the fourth day\r\n after the death. My informant, taking a last look at the deceased,\r\n was struck by the complete absence of all the ordinary signs of death\r\n at such a period. In particular, he states that there was no rigidity\r\n in any part of the body, and there was a perceptible tinge of colour\r\n in the forehead. He went over to the doctor who had attended the\r\n deceased, described all the signs that he had observed, and begged the\r\n doctor to come and look at the body before the coffin was closed. The\r\n doctor absolutely refused, saying that he had given his certificate,\r\n and had no doubt as to the man’s death. The friend then suggested that\r\n he might himself open a vein and see if blood flowed, to which the\r\n doctor replied that, if he did so without the authority of the widow,\r\n he would be indictable for felony. Whereupon, says my informant, who\r\n was only a friend of the family, ‘I had to retire baffled, and let\r\n matters take their course.’ Why on earth he did not take the widow\r\n into his confidence, or risk an indictment for felony by opening a\r\n vein on his own account, or even summon another doctor, he does not\r\n say. I trust that, should any friend of mine see my coffin about to\r\n be screwed down under similar circumstances, and find equal cause to\r\n doubt whether I am dead, he will summon up courage to stick a pin\r\n into me, and chance the consequences. This, however, has nothing to\r\n do with the doctor’s responsibilities. It would seem that the medico\r\n in this case was either so confident in his own opinion as to decline\r\n even to walk across the road to investigate the extraordinary symptoms\r\n described to him, or else that he preferred the chance of the man\r\n being buried alive to the chance of having to admit he had made a\r\n mistake. Which alternative is the worst I do not know.”\r\n\r\nThe _Gaulois_ (Paris) of May 16, 1894, contains the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “DEATH OR CATALEPSY?\r\n\r\n “The funeral of the Comtesse de Jarnac, whose death was reported to\r\n have taken place on Saturday, was fixed for to-morrow, but it will\r\n probably be postponed. None of the usual signs of dissolution have\r\n appeared; the face still retains its colour, and _rigor mortis_ has\r\n not yet set in. Some hope is even entertained that the Comtesse may be\r\n simply in a state of catalepsy, and that the embolus, to which death\r\n was attributed, may have lodged in the lungs, not in the heart, in\r\n which case it may merely have caused a stoppage of the circulation\r\n (_sic_). The body had not been placed in the coffin up to a late hour\r\n last night.”\r\n\r\n[CASE IN THE AUSTRIAN TYROL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGULATION BY A SCARF.\r\n\r\nOne of the authors was present on May 14, 1894, with a company of\r\nladies and gentlemen gathered at a country mansion in the Austrian\r\nTyrol for afternoon tea, when the conversation turned upon the subject\r\nof premature burial. Among other cases related, the host described\r\nthat of one of his servants, a woman, who went to bed with toothache,\r\na long scarf being wrapped around her face and neck. As she did not\r\nappear the following morning, our host entered her room, and found her,\r\nas he supposed, strangled to death by the scarf tightly wound about\r\nher neck. A doctor was summoned, when he found that the woman was warm\r\nand limp, her face soft and coloured as in life; yet, as there was\r\nno respiration or perceptible wrist-pulse, nor beating of the heart,\r\nhe regarded her as dead, and thought it would be proper to bury her.\r\nThe host had doubts, however, about the case, and, having decided to\r\nobserve it further, he had the woman removed to an outhouse, where she\r\nremained three days longer without any change in her appearance or\r\ncondition in any way. But, as there was considerable impatience felt\r\nat the delay of the burial by the people on the estate, the host sent\r\nfor two doctors to make a final examination of the woman, and decide\r\nas to the existence of life or death. The doctors found that no change\r\nhad taken place--there was softness of the skin, colour in the face,\r\nlimpness of the muscles, and an unmistakable warmth of the body; but,\r\nas there was an absence of apparent respiration and beating of the\r\nheart, they decided that the woman was dead, and urged her burial,\r\nwhich was done. They attributed the high temperature to the process\r\nof decomposition which they assumed was going on, though there was no\r\nodour of putrefaction noticed by anyone.\r\n\r\nThe probabilities are that this woman was buried alive. And in the\r\npresent state of medical education on the subject of apparent death and\r\nthe causes that bring it about, many physicians would have come to a\r\nlike conclusion; and, as physicians know but little about it, they are\r\nnot on their guard concerning its dangers.\r\n\r\nA number of cases of apparent death that have survived--where there was\r\nstrangulation from a scarf, as in this case--have been reported. The\r\nexplanation in such cases is, that the pressure of the scarf around the\r\nneck keeps the venous blood from flowing down from the brain through\r\nthe jugular veins, and the brain, in consequence, becomes saturated\r\nwith carbonic acid gas from the detained venous blood, and a death-like\r\nstupor caused by carbonic acid poisoning ensues. Artificial respiration\r\nwould, it is believed, restore such persons to consciousness.\r\n\r\n[AN UNDERTAKER’S EXPERIENCE.]\r\n\r\nA leading West End undertaker, whose letter is before me, writes\r\nunder date of June 26, 1896, as follows:--“In my experience I have\r\nhad but one case come under my personal observation where I had real\r\nuncertainty as to death being actually present, and that was an\r\ninstance of the kind in which this calamity is only likely, in my\r\nopinion, to occur. A girl who had been to work in Borwick’s factory\r\napparently fainted and died, and within a few days the friends buried\r\nher. When we came to close the coffin, there was no evidence of death,\r\nand we did not close it without having a doctor sent for, and receiving\r\nhis assurance that she was dead. When reading the fatal cases which\r\nhave come to light upon this subject, I must confess to looking back\r\nupon that instance with much fear, and it is but a poor consolation to\r\nme that the responsibility was not mine, but the medical man’s.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing cases are recorded because they are types of a class\r\nthat nearly every physician, undertaker, clergyman, or other observer\r\nhas met with or heard of, and the probabilities, having regard to the\r\nexisting confusion and uncertainty of opinion on the signs of death,\r\nare on the side of apparent rather than real death. On the other hand,\r\na medical correspondent informs the author that he is sceptical as to\r\nthe reported cases of narrow escapes, as on more than one occasion his\r\nefforts to verify the facts have proved abortive. It must be admitted\r\nthat there are difficulties in the way of such inquiries. If the\r\nsubject of trance, or narrow escape from burial, is a lady, publicity\r\ninjures her prospects of marriage, and, if a young man, his reputation\r\nfor business stability is endangered or prejudiced, so that this\r\nreticence on the part of relatives is hardly surprising. Such persons\r\ndo not like their gruesome and unpleasant experiences to be talked\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPREDISPOSING CAUSES AND CONDITIONS OF DEATH-COUNTERFEITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOSE who are most subject to the various forms of death-counterfeit\r\nare persons whose vocations exhaust the nervous force faster than\r\nthe natural powers of recuperation, and who resort to narcotics and\r\nstimulants to counteract the consequent physical depression. Dr. Alex.\r\nWilder, in his “Perils of Premature Burial,” London, E. W. Allen,\r\np. 19, says:--“We exhaust our energies by overwork, by excitement,\r\ntoo much fatigue of the brain, the use of tobacco, and sedatives or\r\nanæsthetics, and by habits and practices which hasten the Three Sisters\r\nin spinning the fatal thread. Apoplexy, palsy, epilepsy, are likely to\r\nprostrate any of us at any moment, and catalepsy, perhaps, is not very\r\nfar from any of us.” Equally, if not even more likely, to be overtaken\r\nby these simulacra of death are the poor--the ill-fed, ill-conditioned,\r\nand overworked classes.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the causation of catalepsy, Dr. W. R. Gowers, in Quain’s\r\n“Dictionary of Medicine,” p. 216, says:--“Nervous exhaustion is the\r\ncommon predisponent; and emotional disturbance, especially religious\r\nexcitement, or sudden alarm, and blows on the head and back, are\r\nfrequent immediate causes. It occasionally occurs in the course of\r\nmental affections, and especially melancholia, and as an early symptom\r\nof epilepsy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFAINTING FITS.\r\n\r\nDr. James Curry, F.A.S., in his “Observations on Apparent Death,” pp.\r\n81, 82, referring to those conditions and diseases which predispose\r\nto death-counterfeits, to which women are more liable than men,\r\nsays:--“The faintings which most require assistance, and to which,\r\ntherefore, I wish particularly to direct the attention of my readers\r\nand the public, are those that take place from loss of blood, violent\r\nand long-continued fits of coughing, excessive vomiting or purging,\r\ngreat fatigue or want of food, and likewise after convulsions, and in\r\nthe advanced stage of low fevers. It is but seldom, however, that any\r\nattempt at recovery is made in such cases; and several reasons may be\r\nassigned for this, particularly the great resemblance that fainting\r\nfits of any duration bear to _actual death_, and the firm belief of the\r\nbystanders that the circumstances which preceded were sufficient to\r\ndestroy life entirely.”\r\n\r\nThe author continues, pp. 106, 107:--“Nervous and highly hysterical\r\nfemales, who are subject to fainting fits, are the most frequent\r\nsubjects of this kind of apparent death; in which the person seems in\r\na state very nearly resembling that of hibernating animals, such as\r\nthe dormouse, bat, toad, frog, etc., which annually become insensible,\r\nmotionless, and apparently dead, on the setting in of the winter’s\r\ncold, but spontaneously revive on the returning warmth of spring. Here,\r\nby some peculiar and yet unknown circumstance, the vital principle has\r\nits action suspended, but neither its existence destroyed, nor its\r\norgans injured, so as absolutely to prevent recovery, if not too long\r\nneglected.”\r\n\r\n[THE VITAL PRINCIPLE SUSPENDED.]\r\n\r\nDr. Franz Hartmann reports a case which occurred within half a mile of\r\nhis residence near Hallein, Austria:--“At Oberalm, near Hallein, there\r\ndied the widow of a Dr. Ettenberger, a lawyer. It was known that she\r\nhad previously been affected with fits of catalepsy, and therefore all\r\npossible means were taken for the purpose of restoring her to life.\r\nAll, however, were in vain, and her death appeared to be certain. On\r\nthe third day, just before the hour appointed for the funeral, the\r\nfamily physician, Dr. Leber, bethought himself of trying some fresh\r\nexperiments on the corpse, when the woman revived. She had been fully\r\nconscious all the time, and aware of all the preparations that were\r\nmade for her funeral, although unable to make it known to others that\r\nshe was still alive.”\r\n\r\nDr. Hartmann says:--“In 1866, in Kronstadt, a young and strong man,\r\nOrrendo by name, had a fit and died. He was put into a coffin and\r\ndeposited in the family vault in a church. Fourteen years afterwards,\r\nin 1880, the same vault was opened again for the purpose of admitting\r\nanother corpse. A horrible sight met those who entered. Orrendo’s\r\ncoffin was empty, and his skeleton lying upon the floor. But the rest\r\nof the coffins were also broken open and emptied of their contents. It\r\nseemed to show that the man after awakening had burst his coffin open,\r\nand, becoming insane, had smashed the others, after which he had been\r\nstarved to death.”--_Premature Burial_, _p._ 7.\r\n\r\nBouchut, in “Signes de la Mort,” p. 40, relates that “A lawyer at\r\nVesoul was subject to fits of fainting, but kept the matter secret,\r\nso that the knowledge of it might not spread and interfere with his\r\nprospects of marriage; he only spoke confidentially of it to one of\r\nhis friends. The marriage took place, and he lived for some time in\r\ngood health, then suddenly fell into one of his fits, and his wife\r\nand the doctors, believing him dead, had him placed in a coffin, and\r\ngot everything ready for the funeral. His friend was absent, but\r\nfortunately returned just in time to prevent the burial. The lawyer\r\nrecovered, and lived for sixteen years after this event.”\r\n\r\n\r\nINTENSE COLD.\r\n\r\n[EFFECTS OF INTENSE COLD.]\r\n\r\nM. Charles Londe, in “La Mort Apparente,” p. 16, says:--“Intense cold,\r\ncoincident with privations and fatigue, will produce all the phenomena\r\nof apparent death--phenomena susceptible of prolongation during several\r\ndays without producing actual death, and consequently exposing the\r\nindividual who could be restored to life to living burial;” and he\r\nfurther maintains it as an indisputable fact that every day people are\r\nthus interred alive.\r\n\r\nStruve, in his essay on “Suspended Animation,” p. 140, says:--“In no\r\ncase whatever is the danger of committing homicide greater than in the\r\ntreatment of persons who have suffered by severe cold. Their death-like\r\nstate may deceive our judgment, not only because such persons continue\r\nlongest apparently dead, but because the want of susceptibility of\r\nirritation is in many cases not distinguishable from real death. A man\r\nbenumbed with cold burnt his feet, and had continued insensible to\r\npain, nor did he feel this sensation till he warmed them at a fire.\r\nIn this case it is evident that the susceptibility of irritation was\r\ndestroyed, while vital power remained.”\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENZA.\r\n\r\nThis is a malady that has been enormously rife all over the world\r\nduring the past few years, and has baffled the efforts of physicians\r\nand sanitarians to arrest its progress: it is sometimes accompanied by\r\nconditions which can hardly be distinguished from catalepsy.\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_, May 31, 1890, page 1215, gives the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “CATALEPSY AS A SEQUELA OF INFLUENZA.\r\n\r\n “The neurotic sequelæ of influenza seem engaging more attention abroad\r\n than at home, probably from their symptoms being more pronounced than\r\n on this side the Channel. ‘Nonna,’ as it is called, if something more\r\n than the somnolence succeeding the exhaustion of influenza, has been\r\n thought in Upper Italy to have much in common with catalepsy--one\r\n case, indeed, amounting to the ‘apparent death’ of Pacini. This is\r\n reported from Como. The patient, Pasquale Ossola by name, had to\r\n all appearance died, and a certificate to that effect, after due\r\n consultation, was drawn up and signed. Already it wanted but an hour\r\n or so to the interment, when the ‘corpse’ began to move spontaneously\r\n and to exhibit signs of returning life. The relatives of the supposed\r\n dead man at once called in assistance, and though animation and\r\n consciousness, even to recognition, were restored, the resuscitation\r\n was not maintained, and the patient died. Fortunately, the funeral had\r\n been arranged on the traditional lines, and the faint chance of return\r\n to life was not extinguished by cremation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNARCOTICS.\r\n\r\n[CHLOROFORM DEATHS PREVENTABLE.]\r\n\r\nReferring to the supposed death of a girl, Sarola, aged eleven years,\r\nto whom chloroform had been administered in September, 1894, under\r\npeculiar circumstances, and the body hurried off to cremation, Dr.\r\nRoger S. Chew, of Calcutta, writes:--“That bottle of medicine was\r\ncharged with having caused the death of little Sarola, who, I firmly\r\nbelieve, was _burned alive_ while in a cataleptic condition induced by\r\nthe hysterical convulsions, and rendered profound by the administration\r\nof the chloroform. Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Lawrie agrees\r\nwith me that at least ninety per cent. of the chloroform deaths are\r\npreventable if proper measures are adopted to resuscitate the body,\r\nand it is quite possible for a chloroform narcotic to be launched\r\ninto eternity on the funeral pyre or in the suffocating earth. What\r\na mournful vista Sarola’s case opens up, and who can say how many\r\nhundreds have been similarly disposed of!”--_Communicated to the\r\nAuthor._\r\n\r\nSir Benjamin Ward Richardson, in “The Absolute Signs and Proofs of\r\nDeath,” in the _Asclepiad_, first quarter, 1889, p. 9, says:--“In\r\nthe first experiments made in this country with chloral, after the\r\ndiscovery of its effects by Liebriech, we learned that such a deep\r\nnarcotism could be induced by this narcotic that it might be impossible\r\nto say whether an animal under its influence were alive or dead.” And\r\nreferring to cataleptic trance due to shock, he observes, p. 11, “True\r\ntraumatic catalepsy is equally remarkable, and equally embarrassing.\r\nIt has been witnessed in the most destructive form after shock by\r\nlightning, and it may also have been met with after severe blows and\r\ncontusions of the head.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOLERA.\r\n\r\nDr. Chew, referring to another of the predisposing causes of apparent\r\ndeath, and the danger of premature burial in India, says:--“In the\r\ncholera season there is a risk of a soldier being buried alive, as\r\nthe custom is to get rid of the body as soon as possible, and it is\r\nvery seldom indeed that a _post-mortem_ is held on a cholera corpse.\r\nIf the case be one of _true_ cholera, decomposition sets in before\r\nthe breath has entirely left the body, and, immediately life is\r\nextinct, putrefaction rushes forward so rapidly as to render a mistake\r\nimpossible; but in choleraic diarrhœa or the lighter forms of cholera\r\nit is possible that coma resultant on extreme collapse may suspend\r\nanimation so as to simulate real death _without_ actual cessation of\r\nvital energy, and lead to live sepulture, except where, by some such\r\nlucky accident as the burial ground being a long journey off, the\r\nfuneral is delayed sufficiently to give a chance of recovery. And this\r\nsame accident may prove a salvation in syncope or coma from shock or\r\nprotracted illness.\r\n\r\n“With the civil population, save in very exceptional cases, there is\r\nvery little chance of recovery from apparent death, as the time between\r\nalleged decease and sepulture is very short indeed; and unless there\r\nare unmistakable signs of trance, syncope, or coma, the victim must die\r\n_after he_ (or she) _has been buried alive_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS PREDISPOSING DISEASES.\r\n\r\n[THEIR NUMBER AND VARIETY.]\r\n\r\nLiving burials take place because the general public are ignorant of\r\nthe fact that there are many (some thirty) diseases, and some states\r\nof the body that cannot be called diseases, as well as a number of\r\nincidents and accidents, which produce all the appearances of death so\r\nclosely as to deceive any one.\r\n\r\nExcessive joy or excessive grief will often paralyse the nervous\r\nsystem, including the action of the heart and the respiratory\r\nfunctions, and occasion the appearance of sudden death as well as\r\nshocks, blows upon the head, fright, strokes of lightning, violent\r\ndisplays of temper; also certain drugs now in common medical use, such\r\nas Indian hemp, atropia, digitalis, tobacco, morphia, and veratrum.\r\nAccording to Dr. Léonce Lénormand, in “Des Inhumations Précipitées,”\r\npp. 85-104, the following diseases and conditions not infrequently\r\nproduce the like symptoms, viz., apoplexy, asphyxia, catalepsy,\r\nepilepsy, nervous exhaustion, ecstasy, hæmorrhage, hysteria, lethargy,\r\nsyncope, tetanus, etc.\r\n\r\nDr. Herbert Mayo in his “Letters on Truths contained in Popular\r\nSuperstitions,” p. 34, remarks “that death-trance belongs to diseases\r\nof the nervous system, but in any form of disease, when the body is\r\nbrought to a certain state of debility, death-trance may supervene.”\r\n\r\nDr. Hartmann observes: “The cases in which persons apparently dead have\r\nbeen restored to health by appropriate means are innumerable, and such\r\naccounts may be added to without end, as they are of daily occurrence,\r\nwhile it is also self-evident that, if they had not thus been saved,\r\npremature burial and death in the coffin would have taken place. But it\r\nalso often happens that cases of apparent death recover spontaneously,\r\nand even after all possible means taken for the restoration of life\r\nhave failed. This is specially the case in catalepsy, due to nervous\r\nexhaustion, which requires no other remedy than sufficient rest for the\r\nrecuperation of the life-power, which no kind of medicine can supply.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPREMATURE BURIAL AND CREMATION IN INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE following are some of the facts and experiences which were brought\r\nto the author’s notice during a visit to India in the early part of\r\n1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALCUTTA BURNING GHAT.\r\n\r\nOn February 9, 1896, I visited the Burning Ghat on the banks of the\r\nGanges, Calcutta, where twenty bodies are reduced to ashes by fire\r\ndaily. The corpse of an aged Hindu woman had just been brought in on\r\nmy arrival, death, we were told, having occurred but an hour before.\r\nThe deputy registrar asked the nearest relative a few questions as to\r\nthe age, caste, next of kin, cause of death, which were duly recorded\r\nin a book kept for that purpose, and, the charges having been paid,\r\nthe body, which was as supple as in life (and, except for want of\r\nvolition, bore no visible marks of death), was placed upon the logs,\r\nwhich were alternately crossed over each other, other logs being placed\r\non the top of the body, with straw underneath. The family being poor in\r\nthis case, no expensive spiced oils, ghee, or sandal wood were used.\r\nThe pyre having been sprinkled with water from the sacred river, the\r\nnearest male relative took a wisp of lighted straw and ran seven times\r\nround it, shouting “Ram, Ram, sach hai” (the god Ram is true and great\r\nindeed). He then applied the torch, which in a few seconds reached the\r\nbody, while a Hindu priest recited verses from the Vedas. The process\r\nof burning occupied about four hours. Two other bodies, one an adult,\r\nand the other a child, were nearly burnt to ashes during my visit.\r\nIt appears that in India, when the body is motionless, and assumes a\r\ndeath-like appearance, as in trance or catalepsy, no attempt is ever\r\nmade at resuscitation, no matter how suddenly or unexpectedly the\r\nsupposed death may occur, nor is there any proper method of examination\r\nfor the purpose of death certification. Amongst the Hindus death is not\r\nconsidered an evil, but is the gate leading to a better and happier\r\nworld. Many Hindus when ill are carried by their friends to the banks\r\nof the sacred Ganges, where they meet death with much hope, and without\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nAt the General Hospital, Colombo, I was told by Dr. Van Lagenberg\r\nthat there was absolutely no protection against premature burials for\r\npersons subject to trance, as, although according to the law medical\r\ncertification was obligatory, medical examination was not; the doctor\r\ntaking the word of the friends as to the fact of death, and certifying\r\naccordingly. Early burial (about six hours after death) was the rule.\r\nThe Mother Superior to the staff of nurses mentioned the case of the\r\nvenerable Father Vestarani, an aged Catholic priest of Colombo, who was\r\nsubject to attacks of epilepsy: these were followed by apparent death,\r\nand he had several narrow escapes from premature burial. This case was\r\nalso known to my friend, Mr. Peter de Abrew, of Colombo, and others.\r\nThe house surgeon, Dr. H. M. Fernando, said that amongst the Moslems\r\nburial followed apparent death very quickly, sometimes in an hour.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Vira Raghava Chri, of Madras, manager of the _Hindu_, I\r\nlearned that the Brahmins always burn the dead soon after death occurs.\r\nThe relatives, if they reside within easy reach, are sent for. The body\r\nis washed in cold water, and after two or three hours the religious\r\nservice begins, which is performed by the priests, and consists of\r\ncitations from the Vedas having reference to the departure of the soul\r\nfrom the body, and to the lessons the solemn event teaches. These\r\nceremonies generally last for two or three hours, after which the body\r\nis taken to be burned. In answer to my inquiries as to what would\r\nhappen if within that time no sign of decomposition was exhibited, Mr.\r\nChri informed me that under no circumstances would they wait for more\r\nthan six hours before the body was taken to be burned. He had heard of\r\ncases of persons declared to be dead coming to life while being carried\r\nto the funeral pyre, when they were restored to and welcomed by their\r\nfriends. Cases were also known of the corpse sitting up amidst the\r\nflames, and being beaten down by those in charge of the funeral. They\r\nwere believed to be the victims of premature cremation. He thought,\r\nhowever, that such cases were rare amongst his co-religionists.\r\n\r\n[DIFFICULTY OF DIAGNOSIS.]\r\n\r\nMr. Mohan Chunder Roy, M.B., of Benares, said that it was a very\r\ndifficult matter, even for a medical practitioner, to distinguish the\r\nliving from the dead, and, where there were no signs of putrefaction,\r\nit was his custom to advise the relatives to wait before burial, or\r\nbefore sending the body to the burning ghat, which they were very\r\nreluctant to do. When apparent revivals to consciousness occurred on\r\nthe pyre, the superstitious people believed that it was due to the\r\npresence of evil spirits, and the attempt to escape is frustrated by\r\ncremators in charge of the burning ghat. This barbarous custom has been\r\nrepeatedly affirmed to me by intelligent natives as a matter of common\r\nnotoriety.\r\n\r\nOne reason why Hindus are hurried to the cremation ground so quickly,\r\nand without waiting to see whether the case is one of trance or\r\nsuspended animation, is that the relatives are not allowed either to\r\neat or drink while the body remains in the house. If a person touches\r\nany article in the house of mourning, that article must be washed and\r\npurified. After the cremation all the relatives purify themselves by\r\nbathing before they are allowed to eat or drink.\r\n\r\nMr. Durga Prasad, editor of the _Harbinger_, Lahore, writes, February\r\n29, 1896:--“I recollect, when about twelve years old, my grandmother,\r\nwho was held in great esteem for her piety and experience, told me that\r\nshe was once declared to be dead, and was therefore carried to our\r\ncrematorium, or burning-place; but when about to be burnt she came back\r\nto life.”\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph, assistant secretary at the Public Library and Museum,\r\nColombo, told the author that his father, owing to weakness of the\r\nheart, was subject to frequent attacks of trance-like insensibility.\r\nThey passed away by simple treatment in a few hours, but were sometimes\r\nquite alarming. He was afraid, owing to the superstitious fear of death\r\namong the ignorant classes in Ceylon, and the terror which keeping a\r\ncorpse, or a person in a state of catalepsy, where volition had ceased,\r\nexcited, that many were buried or burned alive, as it was the custom,\r\nparticularly amongst the Mahomedans, to carry the body away a few hours\r\nafter death. Signs of decomposition quickly appeared in a tropical\r\nclimate, but this unequivocal mode of verifying death was not often\r\nwaited for by Moslems.\r\n\r\n\r\nSRI SUMANGALA ON SINHALESE BURIALS IN CEYLON.\r\n\r\n[BURIAL IN CEYLON.]\r\n\r\nSri Sumangala, the venerable High Priest of the Buddhists of Ceylon,\r\nand Principal of the College for Buddhist Priests, at an interview the\r\nauthor had with him in January, 1895, stated that among the Sinhalese\r\nthe chances of burial or cremation of the apparently dead are not\r\nfrequent. Their customs are such that a corpse is seldom or never\r\nremoved for burial or cremation before the expiry of twenty-four hours\r\nafter death is said to have taken place. During that time climatic\r\ninfluence renders signs of decomposition and putrefaction apparent.\r\n\r\nOnly one case came under the observation of the venerable theologian,\r\nwhich was that of a person bitten by a cobra. The man apparently\r\nsuccumbed, but a native specialist, having arrived at the cemetery\r\njust before the burial, examined the case, and said that life was _not\r\nextinct_, and saved the man from a premature grave.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the _British Medical Journal_, April 26, 1884, p.\r\n844:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “PREMATURE INTERMENT.\r\n\r\n “The _Times of India_, for March 21, has the following story:--On last\r\n Friday morning the family of a Goanese, named Manuel, aged seventy\r\n years, who had been for the last four months suffering from dysentery,\r\n thinking that he was dead, made preparations for his funeral. He was\r\n placed in a coffin and taken from his house, at Worlee, to a chapel\r\n at Lower Mahim, preparatory to burial. The priest, on putting his hand\r\n on the man’s chest, found his heart still beating. He was thereupon\r\n removed to the Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital, where he remained in an\r\n unconscious state up to a late hour on last Friday night, when he\r\n died.”\r\n\r\nIn a communication to the author from Mr. Nasarvariji F. Billimoria,\r\ndated March 14, 1896, the writer says that, where cases of premature\r\nburning have occurred in India, the relatives are unwilling to have\r\nthe facts published, and shrink from making them known. Moreover, when\r\nmembers of a family once declared dead have been rejected by their\r\nfriends in the land of shadows, and have returned to this life, they\r\nare believed to bring misfortune with them, and discredit is attached\r\nto the families in consequence. Mr. Billimoria says the following cases\r\ncan be relied upon as authentic:--\r\n\r\n “In the year 18--, in the town of B----, a Marwari was taken as dead\r\n and carried to the cremation ground. Unfortunately, at that time a\r\n superstition was prevalent among all classes of Indians that, if a\r\n dead one is brought back to his or her house, a plague would break\r\n out in the town. When, therefore, the Marwari survived, instead\r\n of bringing him back to the house, or even allowing him to roam\r\n elsewhere, he was killed, it is said, by a hatchet, which they were\r\n in the habit of carrying with them to break the fuel for the funeral\r\n pyre. This had happened in the old Gaekwari days when Governments did\r\n not interfere in the superstitious customs of the people.”\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, those days are gone, and with them the old\r\nsuperstitions. Some time ago a fisherwoman, after taking a liberal\r\ndose of alcoholic drink and opium, was found (apparently) dead by her\r\nrelatives--low-caste Hindus. No time is lost among the Hindus, high or\r\nlow caste, to remove the body to the cremation ground after a man is\r\nfound dead.\r\n\r\n “A bamboo bier was being prepared to carry the fisherwoman to the\r\n _Samashân_ (cremation ground), upon which the body was laid as usual,\r\n and the relatives were to lift it to their shoulders: when, lo! the\r\n woman turned herself on the bier on her side, and, thanks to the good\r\n sense of the fishermen, she is still enjoying her life while I am\r\n writing.\r\n\r\n [HASTY CREMATION.]\r\n\r\n “A young daughter of a Bania was sick for a long time, and was found\r\n apparently dead by her relatives, and carried to the _Samashân_. These\r\n grounds are generally situated at a river side. When the bier was\r\n prepared for certain ceremonies, the girl showed signs of revival,\r\n and, one by one, the relatives would go near the bier, bend down,\r\n stare at the face, and retire aghast. Information had reached the town\r\n that the girl had survived; but the body, nevertheless, was cremated,\r\n and never brought back to the house. It is believed that in this case,\r\n although the girl had revived for a little time, she had died soon\r\n afterwards, as she had been ill for a long time previously. Granting\r\n that it was a case in which the dying became actively conscious a few\r\n minutes before real death, it is certain that great and indecent haste\r\n was practised by the relatives in pressing on the cremation, as is the\r\n usual mode in India.”\r\n\r\nThe _Bombay Guardian_, January 11, 1896, under the head of “The Week’s\r\nNews,” announced that--\r\n\r\n “A Brahmin went to Poona to attend the National Congress. He was laid\r\n up with fever, became dangerously ill, and fell into a trance. His\r\n friends, thinking him dead, made the necessary arrangements for the\r\n funeral. They took the supposed dead man to the river to be burned,\r\n but, just as the funeral procession arrived near the Shane temple, his\r\n head and hands were seen moving. The cloth having been removed from\r\n his face, he opened his eyes and tried to speak. He was taken home.”\r\n\r\nThis case was reported also in the _Times of India_.\r\n\r\nThe subject of hasty and premature burials in India might with much\r\nprofit be introduced at the National Congress. The author believes\r\nthat thousands of people are annually buried and burned in a state of\r\nsuspended animation--particularly in places where cholera, small-pox,\r\nand other devastating plagues prevail. It is usual, both amongst\r\nthe Parsees and the Hindus, to begin preparations for the religious\r\nceremonies when the case is considered hopeless.\r\n\r\nDr. Roger S. Chew, of Calcutta, who for some years occupied the\r\nposition of army surgeon in India, writes to me:--“Though there is\r\nevery risk of live interment with those classes who bury their dead,\r\nthis is a risk (save in cases of epidemic or battlefield) the British\r\nsoldier never runs in India, where the military law requires that a\r\n_post-mortem_ examination, not earlier than twelve hours after decease,\r\nmust be held on every soldier who dies from any cause except a highly\r\ncontagious or infectious disease.” In the present unsatisfactory state\r\nof the law might not this safeguard be generally adopted?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOWERS OF SILENCE, BOMBAY.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, March 15, 1896, my daughter and I were accompanied to the\r\nTowers of Silence, situated on the highest part of Malabar Hill,\r\nBombay, by Mr. Phiroze C. Sethna, a highly accomplished Parsee\r\nmerchant, to whom we were indebted for many acts of kindness during our\r\nsojourn in the city. The position is one of rare beauty, commanding\r\nas it does charming panoramic views of Bombay and the surrounding\r\nneighbourhood, while immediately below are extensive cocoa and other\r\ntropical plantations. At the entrance to the towers is a notice-board\r\nin English, stating that none but Parsees are admitted. We passed under\r\nthe porch into the sacred enclosure, and found ourselves in the midst\r\nof a lovely garden planted with choice shrubs and trees, and were each\r\npresented by the gardener with bouquets of freshly-cut flowers.\r\n\r\n[THE TOWERS OF SILENCE.]\r\n\r\nThe towers are five in number, the smallest having been erected in\r\n1669, all modelled after the same pattern, and are about twenty-five\r\nfeet high. Inside is a circular platform about three hundred feet in\r\ncircumference paved with large slabs, and divided into rows of shallow\r\nopen receptacles in which the bodies are placed. There are three\r\nsections--for males, females, and children. We noticed a number of\r\nvultures sitting on the adjacent trees, and were informed that, when a\r\nfuneral is on its way, large numbers congregate upon the coping of the\r\ntower, ready to seize the body and devour it the moment it is deposited\r\nby the corpse-bearers on the slabs, after the conclusion of the funeral\r\nceremonies. In an hour or less the corpse is completely stripped of its\r\nflesh, when the bones are thrown into a well. From a sanitary point of\r\nview, the plan is preferable to burying or to cremation, which last,\r\nas it is carried out in India, is a slow and tedious process. Vultures\r\nhave never been known to attack children, or even babies left by their\r\nmothers tied for safety to a branch of a tree, and will not, it is\r\nsaid, attack a person only apparently dead, as in a trance or coma.\r\n\r\nAnother custom amongst the Parsees in the treatment of their dead is\r\nto bring a dog to the corpse before it is removed from the house, and\r\nanother dog on its arrival at the Tower of Silence. This ceremony is\r\nknown as the Sagdeed. In a pamphlet on the “Funeral Ceremonies of the\r\nParsees,” by Ervad Jivanji Jamshedje Mody, B.A., a learned priest of\r\nthe Parsee cult, with whom the author had the pleasure of an interview,\r\nthe explanation is that, according to the ancient belief, the spotted\r\ndog can discriminate between the really and the apparently dead. Dr.\r\nFranz Hartmann and other writers appear also to be of the opinion,\r\nwhich the author considers highly probable, that a dog knows whether\r\nhis master is really dead or only in a trance; but that a strange dog\r\nwould be able to discriminate and act as a sentinel to prevent a living\r\nperson being mistaken for a dead one, is highly improbable.\r\n\r\nHaving heard of several cases of persons taken to the Towers of Silence\r\nwho recovered consciousness after being laid within the enclosure, I\r\nasked Mr. Jivanji Mody what would happen in such a case, and what means\r\nof escape there would be? Mr. Mody replied that within the tower there\r\nis a chain hanging from the coping to the floor, by which a person\r\ncould draw himself up to the top of the structure, and he would then be\r\nseen and rescued. In a neatly-constructed model of these towers at the\r\nmuseum, Victoria Gardens, Bombay, no chain is visible. The subject of\r\napparent death, or suspended animation, and how to prevent premature\r\nburial, premature cremation, and premature exposure in the Towers of\r\nSilence, is beginning to excite interest in some parts of India. Mr.\r\nArdeshar Nowroji, Fort Bombay, student of Zoroastrian literature, is to\r\nread a paper on the subject before the Debating Society at Elphinstone\r\nCollege. Mr. Soabjee Dhunjeebhoy Wadia is also studying literature\r\nbearing on the same topic.\r\n\r\nMr. Dadabhoy Nusserwanje, a Bombay Parsee and merchant, residing\r\nat Colombo, Ceylon, informed the author, January 28, 1896, that he\r\nknew of two cases where his co-religionists had been declared dead,\r\nand the bodies prepared for burial (the preparation including the\r\nlong religious service as prescribed by their formulas), who were\r\nonly in a trance. This was proved by their having come back to life\r\nwhen placed in the Towers of Silence in Bombay. It appears that any\r\npersons officially and religiously given over for dead were formerly\r\nnot allowed to be restored to their relatives, or to the society to\r\nwhich they belonged, as they were supposed to carry with them, from\r\ntheir dead associates, liability to plagues or ill luck, and they are\r\nconsequently obliged to migrate to distant parts of the country. My\r\ninformant said that this superstition was so deeply rooted in the minds\r\nof the Parsee people that he did not think a reform was possible.\r\n\r\nCases of persons in a trance, mistaken for dead, are by no means\r\nuncommon, as would appear from the following communication from Mr.\r\nNasarvariji F. Billimoria, a Parsee of Bombay, addressed to Dr. Franz\r\nHartmann, and not previously published:-\r\n\r\n “Several cases of revival of the apparently dead among the Parsees,”\r\n writes Mr. Billimoria, “have come to my notice.\r\n\r\n “A Parsee, whom I shall call M---- B----, was given up as dead. The\r\n body was laid on the ground, and the usual ceremonies were being\r\n performed, when, to the surprise of the people surrounding the body,\r\n he rose and described some spiritual experience. He died long after\r\n this event took place, at a good old age, at Bilimora, a town about\r\n eighty miles north of Bombay.\r\n\r\n “S----, a girl of about ten years, was also taken as dead in the same\r\n town, and, after laying her body on the ground, prayers were being\r\n recited by the priests. She rose and said that she had been to some\r\n other land, where she saw an old lady who ordered her to go away, as\r\n she was not required there just then. She died at a good old age a few\r\n months ago.\r\n\r\n “A woman in the garb of a Hindu beggar was some time ago in the habit\r\n of interviewing Parsee ladies at odd times, viz., at about three or\r\n four o’clock in the morning, at the same place, and asking several\r\n questions pertaining to religion. It was afterwards found that she was\r\n K---- (widow of a Parsee priest), who had apparently died a short time\r\n before, and, after revival, had emerged from the Tower of Silence,\r\n and, a superstition being prevalent among the people that none should\r\n be taken back among us who return from the dead, she dared not unite\r\n with the Parsees, and hence led a wanderer’s life.\r\n\r\n “In Bombay, too, I have heard of some cases of the revival of the\r\n apparently dead among the Parsees, the principal of them being a\r\n lady of a wealthy family, and a Parsee who afterwards carried on his\r\n profession as a physician. The physician was living as a Christian on\r\n account of the prejudice among the Parsees before referred to. He was\r\n called “Mûtchala Dâktar,” _i.e._, doctor with big moustache.\r\n\r\n “Similar cases had also occurred in Surat, where two Parsee women had\r\n returned from the Towers of Silence, one of whom lived afterwards as a\r\n Sanyasini. What became of the other I cannot say.”\r\n\r\n“The funeral ceremonies among the Parsees provide that, after the signs\r\nof death are manifest, the body be washed with warm water, and laid on\r\na clean sheet; two persons hold the hands of the dead person, joining\r\nthemselves by a _paivand_ of tape. The priests recite certain prayers,\r\nafter which the body is laid on ground set apart for the purpose in\r\nthe house. Here it lies for several hours, during which time priests\r\nrecite alternately certain prayers, while a fire is kept alive with\r\nfragrant combustibles near the body. The Nasasâlârs, or corpse-bearers,\r\narrive at the appointed time, when the fire is taken away, and other\r\nmanthrâ or prayers, which occupy an hour or so, are recited by two\r\npriests conjointly, gazing first on the iron bier, and then on the face\r\nof the body. A procession is then formed, and the body is carried by\r\nthe Nasasâlârs only, the others walking in pairs, joining themselves\r\nby holding a handkerchief in their hands, several yards distant from\r\nthe body. The Towers of Silence are removed from the habitations of\r\nmankind, sometimes, miles distant, where, after the arrival of the\r\nfuneral procession, the last obeisance is performed, and the body\r\nis carried into the tower, which is called _Dukhmâh_, the mourners,\r\nexcept the Nasasâlârs, remaining outside. The procession returns after\r\nfurther prayers. The towers are entirely open from above to allow ample\r\nsunlight, and to allow the carrion-birds access to the dead.\r\n\r\n“From the foregoing it would appear that, with regard to the disposal\r\nof the dead, the Parsee system offers advantages, in respect of the\r\nrevival of the supposed dead persons, over the European system of\r\nburial. After real or supposed death, a fire is kept burning near the\r\nbody, the heat of which would indirectly assist in resuscitating those\r\nin a state of suspended animation.\r\n\r\n“If a man dies in the afternoon, his body is not carried to the towers\r\ntill next day, and in that case the fire is kept alive the whole night\r\nnear the body, two priests alternately reciting manthrâs. Some time is\r\nthus allowed to intervene between the supposed death and the disposal\r\nof the body in the Towers of Silence. There, too, the body is not laid\r\nwithout Zoroastrian ceremony. But in the system of disposal itself\r\nwe see another protection, in that the carrion-birds do not touch the\r\nbody unless they instinctively find evidence of putrefaction. It is a\r\nfact that in not a few cases persons have escaped from the dismal and\r\nterrible fate of being laid alive in the Towers of Silence. The system\r\nof disposal in the tower may appear to non-Zoroastrians repulsive; but\r\nneither the system of cremation nor burial will give us back those\r\nwhom they have once devoured. That the Parsees do not allow those who\r\nhave returned from the Towers of Silence to intermingle among them is\r\nanother question. This too, however, has attracted the attention of\r\nthis small community; and I hear that there is a standing order issued\r\nfrom the trustees of the Parsee Panchayet at Bombay to the Nasasâlârs\r\n(the corpse-bearers) to the effect that they would be rewarded if they\r\nwould give information or bring back any body which had been revived\r\nafter it had been carried to the Towers of Silence.”\r\n\r\nThe Parsee custom of using the dog is suggestive. There are numerous\r\ncases on record where a dog, following his master to the grave as one\r\nof the mourners, has refused to leave the grave; and these have been\r\nquoted as a proof of the undying love of the master’s canine friend.\r\nMay it not be that dogs are gifted, as believed by the Parsees,\r\nwith another sense denied to most men--the faculty of discerning\r\nbetween real and apparent death? A medical correspondent relates the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n “In Austria, in 1870, a man seemed to be dead, and was placed in a\r\n coffin. After the usual three days of watching over the supposed\r\n corpse, the funeral was commenced; and when the coffin was being\r\n carried out of the house, it was noticed that the dog which belonged\r\n to the supposed defunct became very cross, and manifested great\r\n eagerness toward the coffin, and could not be driven away. Finally,\r\n as the coffin was about to be placed in the hearse, the dog attacked\r\n the bearers so furiously that they dropped it on the ground; and in\r\n the shock the lid was broken off, and the man inside awoke from his\r\n lethargic condition, and soon recovered his full consciousness. He was\r\n alive and well at last news of him. Dogs might possibly be of use in\r\n deciding doubtful cases, where their master was concerned.”\r\n\r\nAlso the following:--\r\n\r\n[INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS.]\r\n\r\n “The postmaster of a village in Moravia ‘died’ in a fit of epilepsy,\r\n and was buried three days afterwards in due form. He had a little pet\r\n dog which showed great affection towards him, and after the burial\r\n the dog remained upon the man’s grave and howled dismally, and would\r\n not be driven away. Several times the dog was taken home forcibly,\r\n but whenever it could escape it immediately returned. This lasted for\r\n a week, and became the talk of the village. About a year afterwards\r\n that part of the grave-yard had to be removed owing to an enlargement\r\n in building the church, and consequently the grave of the postmaster\r\n was opened, and the body was found in such a state and position as\r\n to leave no doubt that he had been buried alive, had returned to\r\n consciousness, and had died in the grave. The physician who had signed\r\n the certificate of death went insane on that account, soon after the\r\n discovery was made.”--_Premature Burial, p. 109, London ed._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE DANGER OF HASTY BURIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY burials are advocated and defended by certain writers on sanitary\r\ngrounds; and there is, no doubt, something to be said for them,\r\nprovided the body shows unmistakable signs of dissolution; but to\r\nimpose a general rule upon Englishmen by Parliament, or upon Americans\r\nby State Legislature, as has been urged, would add to the existing evil\r\nof perfunctory and mistaken diagnosis of death, and greatly increase\r\nthe number of premature interments. The Romans kept the bodies of\r\nthe dead a week before burial, lest through haste they should inter\r\nthem while life remained. Servius, in his commentary on Virgil, tells\r\nus--“That on the eighth day they burned the body, and on the ninth put\r\nits ashes in the grave.” Plato enjoined the bodies of the dead to be\r\nkept until the third day, _in order_ (as he says) _to be satisfied of\r\nthe reality of the death_. Quintilian explains why the Romans delayed\r\nburials as follows:--“For what purpose do ye imagine that long-delayed\r\ninterments were invented? Or on what account is it that the mournful\r\npomp of funeral solemnities is always interrupted by sorrowful groans\r\nand piercing cries? Why, for no other reason, but because we have seen\r\npersons return to life after they were about to be laid in the grave\r\nas dead.” “For this reason,” adds Lancisi, in “De Subita. Mort.,” lib.\r\ni., cap. 15, “the Legislature has wisely and prudently prohibited\r\nthe immediate, or the too speedy, interment of all dead persons, and\r\nespecially of such as have the misfortune to be cut off by a sudden\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\n[THE ADVANTAGE OF DELAY.]\r\n\r\nTerilli, a celebrated physician of Venice, in a treatise of the\r\n“Causes of Sudden Death,” sect. vi., cap. 2, says:--“Since the body\r\nis sometimes so deprived of every vital function, and the principle\r\nof life reduced so low, that it cannot be distinguished from death,\r\nthe laws both of natural comparison and revealed religion oblige us to\r\nwait a sufficient time for life manifesting itself by the usual signs,\r\nperadventure it should not be, as yet, totally extinguished; and if\r\nwe should act a contrary part, we may possibly become murderers, by\r\nconfining to the gloomy regions of the dead those who are actually\r\nalive.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cooper, surgeon, in his treatise on “The Uncertainty of the\r\nSigns of Death,” pp. 70, 71, had in his possession the following\r\ncertificate, written and signed by Mr. Blau, a native of Auvergne, a\r\nman of untainted veracity:--“I hereto subscribe, and declare, that\r\nfifty-five years ago, happening to reside at Toulouse for the sake\r\nof my studies, and going to St. Stephen’s Church to hear a sermon, I\r\nsaw a corpse brought thither for the sake of interment. The ceremony,\r\nhowever, was delayed till the sermon should be over; but the supposed\r\ndead person, being laid in a chapel and attended by all the mourners,\r\nabout the middle of the sermon discovered manifest signs of life,\r\nfor which reason he was quickly conveyed back to his own house. From\r\na consideration of circumstances, it is sufficiently obvious that,\r\nwithout the intervention of the sermon, the man had been interred\r\nalive.”\r\n\r\nBetween 1780 and 1800 many pamphlets on the subject appeared in Germany\r\nand France. Opposite sides were taken, some advocating delay until\r\nputrefaction, others urging immediate burial.\r\n\r\nIn 1788, Marcus Hertz wrote strongly against the prevailing precipitate\r\nburials among the Jews. He asked “what motive could justify hasty\r\nburials;” and continued:--“The writings of learned men and doctors, of\r\nboth early times and recent date, describe the dangers of precipitate\r\nburial; there is not a town in the world that has not its stories of\r\nrevivals in the grave.”\r\n\r\nIn 1791, Rev. J. W. C. Wolff, in Germany, published numerous narratives\r\nof narrow escapes from the grave.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, Rev. Johann Moritz Schwager stated that he had preached\r\nfor twenty years against precipitate burials, and that he had been\r\nrequested to do so by a number of corporate bodies who had evidence of\r\nthe danger of hasty interments.\r\n\r\nAbout 1800 great excitement prevailed in Germany on account of some\r\nnarrow escapes from living burial that happened in high quarters,\r\nmany books and pamphlets having been issued, and sermons preached\r\nby the clergy on the subject. The key-note of all of these was the\r\nfallaciousness of the appearances of death, and that none was reliable\r\nbut decomposition.\r\n\r\nAbout this period Dr. Herachborg, of Königsberg, Prussia, wrote that,\r\nfor forty years, as a doctor, he had always been disgusted with the\r\npractice of hasty burials; and, to show the ignorance of the times,\r\nhe mentions the case of a woman he kept under observation in bed for\r\nthree days, when her relations took her out and placed her on the\r\nfloor, insisting that she was dead. He resisted her burial, and had\r\nher covered with blankets; so that by being kept warm she recovered\r\ncompletely. He insisted that no sign of death could be relied upon.\r\n\r\n[HASTY BURIAL IN TURKEY.]\r\n\r\nFrom the _British Medical Journal_, April 12, 1862, p. 390. “The\r\n_Gaz. Méd. d’Orient_ tells us that people in Constantinople are, in\r\nall probability, not unfrequently buried alive, in consequence of the\r\nprecipitancy with which their burial is performed. If the person dies\r\nduring the night, he has some chance of escaping premature sepulture;\r\nbut if he dies during the day, he is sure to be in his tomb in two\r\nhours after he has drawn his last breath. Facts of daily occurrence in\r\nthis country, we are told, prove that persons who were thought to have\r\ndied during the night have recovered before morning, and thus, thanks\r\nto the intervention of night, have been saved from being interred\r\nalive. Other facts of not unfrequent occurrence show that persons have\r\nrecovered while on their road to the grave. In other rarer cases,\r\nagain, the cries of the revivified half-buried ones have been heard by\r\nthe passers-by, and thus saved from a horrible conclusion.”\r\n\r\nIn all countries it is the custom amongst the Jews to bury their dead,\r\nand apparently dead, quickly, without taking the slightest steps for\r\nrestoration, and many are the catastrophes recorded.\r\n\r\n“The Report of the Royal Humane Society” of 1802 states:--“At the\r\nfuneral of a Jewess, one of the bearers thought he heard repeatedly\r\nsome motion in the coffin, and informed his friends. Medical assistance\r\nbeing obtained, she returned to her home in a few hours completely\r\nrestored.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _British Medical Journal_, March 8, 1879, p. 356.\r\n\r\n\r\n“SUSPENDED ANIMATION.\r\n\r\n“A Jew, aged seventy, who had been ailing for some time, apparently\r\ndied recently in Lemberg, on a Friday night, after severe convulsions.\r\nThe deceased having been legally certified, the body was put on a\r\nbier, preparatory to the funeral, which had to be deferred, the next\r\nday being the Jewish Sabbath. Two pious brethren who had, according to\r\ntheir custom, been spending the night in prayer, watching the dead,\r\nwere suddenly, on the morning of the Saturday, disturbed from their\r\ndevotions by strange sounds proceeding from the bier, and, to their\r\ndismay, saw the dead man slowly rising, and preparing to descend from\r\nit, using at the same time very strong language. Both brethren fled\r\nvery precipitately; and one of them has since died from the effects\r\nof the fright. It is hoped by the _Wiener Medicinische Zeitung_ that\r\nthis case will make the local government watch the Jewish funerals more\r\ncarefully, as it is known that the Jews often bury their dead very\r\nquickly.”\r\n\r\nThe _Undertakers’ Journal_, January 22, 1887, says:--“The dangers that\r\nmay arise from premature interment are illustrated by a sensational\r\nincident which recently occurred at Trencsin, in Hungary. The wife of\r\nthe Rabbi of the Jewish Congregation apparently died suddenly without\r\nhaving been previously ill. The night before the funeral the female\r\nwatcher, sitting in an adjoining room, heard a noise in the chamber of\r\ndeath, and, when, stricken with horror, she ventured to open the door,\r\nshe found that the seemingly dead woman had risen from her bier, and\r\nhad thrown off the shroud by which she was covered. By a fortunate\r\naccident the interment had been postponed in consequence of the\r\nintervening Sabbath, otherwise a horrible fate would have overtaken the\r\nRabbi’s wife.”\r\n\r\n[THE LANCET’S SUGGESTIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_, August 23, 1884, vol. ii., p. 329, comments thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“BURYING CHOLERA PATIENTS ALIVE.\r\n\r\n“It is not so much undue haste as inexcusable carelessness that must be\r\nblamed for the premature burying of persons who are not really dead.\r\nSuch heedlessness as alone can lead to the commission of this crime is\r\nnot a shade less black than manslaughter. We speak strongly, because\r\nthis is a matter in regard to which measures ought to be at once taken\r\nto render the horrible act impossible, and to dismiss all fear from the\r\npublic mind. If it be a fact, as would seem to be indisputable, that\r\nduring the last few weeks there have been cases--we will not attempt\r\nto say how many or how few--of burying alive, a scandal and a horror,\r\nwholly unpardonable in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, have\r\nto be faced; and the sooner the full truth is known and rules of safety\r\nestablished the better. Let it be once for all decided that measures\r\nshall be taken to ascertain the fact of death before burial. Why not\r\nrevert to the old practice, and _always_ open a vein in the arm after\r\ndeath, or pass a current of electricity through the body before the\r\ncoffin is finally screwed down? It may be held that these unpleasant\r\nresorts are unnecessary. We do not think they are. In any case enough\r\nis known of the possibilities of ‘suspended animation’ to render it\r\nunsafe to bury until the evidences of an actual extinction of life are\r\nunmistakable; and, as it is impossible to wait until decomposition sets\r\nin in all cases of death from infectious diseases, it would be prudent\r\nto adopt what must certainly be the least of evils.”\r\n\r\nIf, as the _Lancet_ maintains, it is not possible to wait until the\r\nonly absolute sign of death is manifest, then, in a large majority\r\nof cases, there is no safety, and those who die fatally mutilated by\r\nhorrible accidents may be considered fortunate. The difficulty, we\r\nadmit, is of a serious nature, particularly for the poor, and can only\r\nbe overcome by the erection of mortuaries, as discussed in another\r\nchapter. The expedient of applying the electric current, suggested by\r\nthe _Lancet_, has been proved useless in cases of death-trance, where\r\nthe patients are impervious to the most violent modes of cutaneous\r\nexcitation.\r\n\r\nThe _Jewish World_, September 13, 1895, observes:--“Cases of trance\r\nand of the burial of persons who only seemed to be dead, and of narrow\r\nescapes of others from the most terrible of all imaginable fates, are\r\nnot so uncommon as most people suppose; and while Jews adhere to the\r\npractice of interring their dead within a few hours after the supposed\r\ndemise, there will always be a risk of such horrible catastrophes\r\nhappening, even more frequently among us than among the general\r\ncommunity. Here is, then, really a matter in which some reform is\r\nneeded, and that without a day’s delay.\r\n\r\n[OPINIONS OF THE “JEWISH WORLD.”]\r\n\r\n“To say nothing of the merely human aspect of this important question,\r\nto bury until decomposition has actually set in might possibly be\r\nshown to be a violation of Jewish Law. It is now commonly admitted\r\nthat even expert medical men cannot be absolutely certain of death\r\nuntil some signs of decomposition have shown themselves. Now, so\r\nstrict is the Jewish Law as regards the risk of destroying life, that\r\nit is prohibited to even move or touch a man or woman who is on the\r\npoint of death, lest we hasten, by a moment, their dissolution. It is,\r\ntherefore, no less than a violation of the Jewish laws against murder\r\nto preserve a custom that involves even the minutest scintilla of risk\r\nof premature burial. It is high time that this question was seriously\r\ntaken up by the Jewish clergy and laity.”[8]\r\n\r\nIn the province of Quebec no interment is permitted within twenty-four\r\nhours, and the Jews reconcile themselves to this delay, which, however,\r\nis far too brief to ensure safety.\r\n\r\nIt will be said that the danger referred to is not so imminent in the\r\nUnited Kingdom as in France, Spain, Portugal, or even in the United\r\nStates, owing to the existence of a more temperate climate, and the\r\nlonger period allowed for burial. This may be so and yet the danger\r\nbe considerable. It must be remembered that in the rural districts\r\nnothing in the shape of examination to establish the fact of death is\r\npractised; while in certain parts of Cornwall, throughout the greater\r\npart of agricultural Ireland, amongst the Jews in all cities and towns,\r\nas well as those who in all places are certified as dead of cholera,\r\nsmall-pox, and other infectious and epidemic diseases, burial often\r\nfollows certified death quite as quickly as in the Continental States\r\nbefore mentioned. In all the public resorts on the Continent the\r\nhotel-keepers, through an insensate fear of death and the injury which\r\nthe possession of “a corpse,” dead or alive, may do to their business,\r\nhave them coffined and disposed of, particularly in the night, within\r\na few hours of their supposed death. Dr. D. de Lignières, in “Pour ne\r\npas être Enterré Vivant,” Paris, 1893, says he has known of burials\r\nunder such circumstances six hours after death. This author says that\r\nthese scandalous homicidal acts are of every-day occurrence, and that\r\nthe rapacious landlords have no difficulty in obtaining certificates of\r\ndeath from the accommodating _mort verificateurs_. Every one who visits\r\nthe _hôtels des villes d’eaux, des stations balnéaires_, may verify\r\n(he says) the truth of this statement for himself. In short, these are\r\nwilling disciples of the “Latest Decalogue”:--\r\n\r\n  “Thou shalt not kill; but need’st not strive\r\n  Officiously to keep alive.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFEAR OF PREMATURE BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANY of those who are most familiar with the phenomena of life and\r\ndeath, including celebrated physicians, men of science, and clergymen,\r\nknowing that all the ordinary signs of death (referred to in another\r\nchapter) have, in practice, sometimes proved delusive, have been a prey\r\nto the suspicion that a fatal mistake is possible in their own case.\r\nThey have, therefore, left precise instructions in their wills for\r\nvarious preventives which experience has shown to be necessary, and in\r\nsome instances a combination of these, so as to make doubly sure that\r\nthey shall not be subjected, like thousands of human beings, to the\r\nunspeakable horrors of being buried alive.\r\n\r\nMr. Horace Welby, in his volume entitled “Mysteries of Life, Death,\r\nand Futurity,” 1861, under the head of “Premature Interment,” p.\r\n114, says:--“How prevalent is the fear of being buried alive may be\r\ngathered from the number of instances in which men have requested that,\r\nbefore the last offices are done for them, such wounds or mutilations\r\nshould be inflicted upon their bodies as would effectually prevent\r\nthe possibility of an awakening in the tomb. Dr. Dibdin relates that\r\nFrancis Douce, the antiquary, requested, in his will, that Sir Anthony\r\nCarlisle, the surgeon, should sever his head from his body, or take out\r\nhis heart, to prevent the return of vitality; and his co-residuary\r\nlegatee, Mr. Kerrick, has also requested the same operation to be\r\nperformed in the presence of his son.”\r\n\r\nBishop Berkeley, Daniel O’Connell, and the late Lord Lytton entertained\r\nsimilar apprehensions. Wilkie Collins had a like fear, for he always\r\nleft on his dressing-table a letter in which he solemnly enjoined\r\nhis people that, if he were found dead in the morning, he should at\r\nonce be carefully examined by a doctor. Hans Christian Andersen had a\r\nsimilar dread, and carried in his pocket a note to the effect that,\r\nwhen the time came, his friends were to make sure that he was really\r\ndead before burial. Harriet Martineau left her doctor ten pounds to see\r\nthat her head was amputated before burial. The dread of being buried\r\nalive dictated a clause in the will of the distinguished actress, the\r\nlate Miss Ada Cavendish, for the severance of the jugular vein; and\r\nprompted the late Mr. Edmund Yates to leave similar instructions, with\r\nthe provision that a fee of twenty guineas should be paid for the\r\noperation, which was carried out. Mr. John Rose, of New York, who died\r\nin November, 1895, made known his earnest desire that his coffin should\r\nnot be closed, but laid in the family vault at Roseton, and guarded day\r\nand night by two caretakers, who were instructed to watch for signs of\r\nreanimation.\r\n\r\nThe late Lady Burton, widow of Sir Richard Burton, provided that her\r\nheart was to be pierced with a needle, and her body to be submitted to\r\na _post-mortem_ examination, and afterwards embalmed (not stuffed) by\r\ncompetent experts. Lady Burton, it is said, had been subject to fits of\r\ntrance on more than one occasion, and was terribly afraid that such an\r\nattack might be diagnosed as death.\r\n\r\nThose who are most apprehensive of apparent death being mistaken for\r\nreal death are the clergy and other ministers of religion, and funeral\r\ndirectors--in other words, those who know most about it.\r\n\r\nLet anyone introduce the subject when in company, on a suitable\r\noccasion, and we shall hear of startling cases sufficient to shake\r\ncredulity, and to compel us to realise the danger to ourselves, as\r\nwell as to all other members of the community, under our present loose\r\ncustoms. If this dread of premature burial is not universal, as some\r\nwriters and authorities aver, it is certainly widely extended; and\r\nthe evidence set before our readers will show that it is by no means\r\nwithout foundation.\r\n\r\n[WIDELY EXTENDED.]\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_, March 17, 1866, says:--“There are many apparently\r\ntrustworthy stories afloat, both in this country and on the Continent,\r\nwhich favour the belief that premature interment not only does\r\nsometimes take place, but is really of not so unfrequent occurrence as\r\nmight be supposed. Some few believe it to be not an unlikely event, and\r\nbreak out into a cold perspiration at the thought of the possibility\r\nof the misfortune happening to themselves. Others have actually made\r\nprovision in their wills that means should be taken, by cutting off a\r\nfinger, or making a pectoral incision, etc., to excite sensibility,\r\nin case any should remain after their supposed death; whilst a French\r\ncountess, in order to escape so terrible a fate, left a legacy to her\r\nmedical attendant as a fee for his severance of the carotid artery in\r\nher body before it was committed to the tomb.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Kingston, chaplain R.N., writing to the (London) _Morning\r\nPost_, September 18, 1895, says--“The danger of being buried alive\r\nappears to be a very real one; and I can testify, from my experience as\r\na clergyman, that a great many persons are haunted by the dread of that\r\nunspeakably horrible fate.” The writer further expresses a hope that\r\nthe ventilation of the subject will be followed by practical results.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking on the subject of premature burials, in a lecture\r\ndelivered at Everett Hall, Brooklyn, New York, June, 1883, Mr. J. D.\r\nBeugless, the then President of the New York Cremation Society, said\r\nthat an undertaker in that city (Brooklyn) recently made provision in\r\nhis will, and exacted a promise from his wife of great caution, that\r\nhis body should be cremated, being induced thereto by the fear of being\r\nburied alive. “Live burials,” he says, “are far more frequent than most\r\npeople think.” It is reported that another undertaker of Brooklyn some\r\ntime since deposited a body in a receiving vault temporarily: when he\r\nwent some days later to remove it for burial, what was his horror, upon\r\nopening the niche in which the coffin had been placed, to find the body\r\ncrouching at the door, stark in death, the hair dishevelled, the flesh\r\nof the arms lacerated and torn, and the face having the most appalling\r\nexpression of horror and despair ever witnessed by mortal eyes!\r\n\r\nAn undertaker, writing to the _Plymouth Morning News_, October 2, 1895,\r\nmentions that he reluctantly buried a young person, who lay in the\r\ncoffin for seven clear days without sign of decomposition, and only\r\nconsented to close the coffin then, on the assurance that the same\r\nconditions attended all the deaths which had previously occurred in the\r\nfamily. Dr. Hartmann and other authorities have found that such cases\r\nare probably the subjects of catalepsy, a malady which sometimes runs\r\nin families and affects every member. The undertaker adds that, in\r\nfuture, he should decline to close the coffin of the apparently dead\r\nuntil signs of decomposition set in, “thus preventing the possibility\r\nof our worst fears being realised.” If undertakers generally would\r\nadopt these wise and necessary precautions, living sepulture would\r\ncome to an end. Under the existing imperfect system of medical\r\nexamination--and, as we have shown, both in England and in the United\r\nStates, where there is usually no examination at all--there is often\r\na reckless haste in interments. No thoughtful persons can contemplate\r\nthe burial of a million and a half human beings annually in these two\r\ncountries without mistrust and misgivings.\r\n\r\nMany well-to-do people in civilised countries provide in their wills\r\nfor the prevention of premature interment, by leaving instructions for\r\nsurgical operations after their decease, _post-mortems_, embalmment,\r\nor cremation. It may happen, however, that wills are mislaid, lost,\r\nor withheld by the testators, or are not opened and read until after\r\nthe funeral, when the instructions in this regard, however strictly\r\nenjoined, are rendered abortive. Legacies should be given conditionally\r\non the observance of certain duties, and only payable on proofs to\r\nthe executors that they have been carried out. A large majority of\r\npeople do not, however, leave testamentary instructions, for the\r\nsimple reason that they have nothing to bequeath. And the majority\r\nhave an equal claim with the minority to be safeguarded by the State\r\nagainst such terrible misfortunes. Syncope, sometimes mistaken for\r\ndeath, is a condition to which both men and women, who are compelled\r\nby their poverty in all large cities to endure exhausting labours in\r\nill-ventilated work-rooms, and their often ill-nourished children in\r\nboard schools in England and in the public schools in America, are\r\npeculiarly liable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSUDDEN DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE idea commonly entertained is that with animal bodies there are\r\nonly two possible conditions--either life or death; that the presence\r\nof one of these conditions implies the absence of the other; that when\r\nthe body has assumed the appearance of death, as during the sudden\r\nsuspension of all the functional activities, it must be dead. This\r\nlast is far from being true; for all the appearances of death are\r\nfallacious, especially those that accompany so-called sudden death.\r\nAll such cases should be challenged as of doubtful character, and held\r\nso till recovery or putrefaction of the tissues proves the presence of\r\nlife or of death. This subject is too often treated by medical writers\r\nwith indifference. Technically, it is regarded as a failure of the\r\nbrain, or lungs, or heart, to perform their functions; popularly, we\r\nsay that “the thread of life is snapped asunder;” or it is “the going\r\nout of life,” like the sudden extinguishing of a candle. The author’s\r\nexperience, however, at the sick bedside, and in the death-chamber,\r\nhas taught him that life leaves the body in a gradual manner, and that\r\ndeath approaches, and takes the place of life, in one part or organ\r\nafter another, thus creeping through the tissues, and sometimes defying\r\nall tests to prove its presence, leaving putrefaction to be its only\r\nsign. There can be no such thing as veritable sudden death, unless the\r\nbody is crushed into a shapeless mass, like an insect under foot.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Farr, of the Registrar-General’s Department, London,\r\nsays:--“No definition of the sense in which _sudden death_ is\r\npractically understood by coroners has been given.” Dr. Granville says:\r\n“The writers on medical jurisprudence do not state with any strictness\r\nwhat they mean by sudden death, whether it be death in ten minutes,\r\nten hours, or ten days.”[9] And he asks in the same vein, “Does sudden\r\ndeath mean death in three minutes, three hours, or three days?”[10]\r\nStill further he remarks regarding the customary definitions, “They\r\nlead one to infer that a certain mysterious principle, called LIFE,\r\nhas been instantaneously withdrawn from a healthy and well-constituted\r\nindividual, who was at the very moment, as heretofore, exercising his\r\nproper animal functions with a regularity that promised to endure for a\r\nlong continuance of years.... No such phenomena occur in Nature, unless\r\nthrough violence or from accident. Under Nature’s laws there is no such\r\nthing as sudden death.... In every case where death has abruptly cut\r\nshort the thread of life, there has been a preparation, more or less\r\nantecedent to the occurrence, which must inevitably have led to it....\r\nThe victim may seem to have been struck down, as if by lightning. But\r\nin reality the event was only the natural termination of an inward\r\nstate of things which insidiously and unexpectedly was preparing the\r\nblow.”[11]\r\n\r\n[DR. TIDY ON CAUSES OF DEATH.]\r\n\r\nDr. Tidy, in “Legal Medicine,” p. 29, says:--“As a rule, the action\r\nrequired to bring about complete molecular death--_i.e._, the\r\nsuspension of vital activity in every part--is progressive. In a\r\ngiven case, therefore, we are unable to state any definite time as\r\nthe period of its occurrence. The popular idea of death is that the\r\nentire body dies at once. Somatic death is an impossibility.” Thus,\r\nit is clear that the process of death, or the departure of life, may\r\nrequire days or weeks for its completion; and it may even be delayed\r\nto a time when putrefaction has set in quite generally, as when the\r\nhair and nails grow after the body has been buried some weeks, as has\r\nbeen credibly reported. Writers upon so-called sudden death recite a\r\nnumber of diseases and conditions which quickly destroy the machinery\r\nthat carries on the vital functions, thus rendering resuscitation quite\r\nimpossible. Tidy[12] names some twelve of such causes: prominent among\r\nthem are diseases of the heart, rupture of the heart, clots in the\r\nblood vessels, aneurisms, effusions of blood in the brain, bursting of\r\nvisceral abscesses, ulcers of the stomach, extra-uterine pregnancy,\r\nrupture of the uterus or bladder, large draughts of cold water taken\r\nwhen the body is heated, cholera, alcoholic poisoning, mental emotions,\r\netc. But he remarks upon these causes--“Because a person dies suddenly,\r\nthere being no evidence of violence or poison, the action adopted by\r\nmany coroners in not requiring a _post-mortem_ examination leaves\r\nthe most important witness--the dead body itself--unheard, and the\r\ninquest so far valueless.” Which may mean that, without the risk of an\r\nautopsy, it is impossible in such cases to determine whether they are\r\nbeyond resuscitation or not, unless putrefaction settles the question.\r\nUnfortunately there is nothing in the external appearance of those\r\ncases of so-called sudden death in which the vital machinery may be\r\ntotally wrecked, to distinguish them from those of apparent death,\r\nin which all the organism is in a state of perfect integrity, and in\r\nwhich resuscitation is possible, provided the vital principle has not\r\nentirely left the body. Consequently, the only safe rule to observe\r\nin all cases in which death has not followed poisoning, or injuries\r\nwhich kill outright, or some known disease of sufficient duration and\r\nseverity to bring on dissolution, is to wait for unmistakable evidences\r\nof decomposition before autopsy, embalming, cremation, or burial is\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\nIn former times precipitate interments of persons who died suddenly\r\nwere specially guarded against.\r\n\r\nNothing is more common, on opening a newspaper, than to see one or more\r\nannouncements of sudden death. These occurrences are so frequent that\r\nthe great London dailies, except when an inquest is held, or when the\r\ndeceased is a person of note, omit to record them. The narratives are\r\nmuch alike: the person, described to be in his usual health, is seized\r\nwith faintness in the midst of his daily-avocation, and he falls down\r\napparently dead; or he retires for the night, and is found dead in his\r\nbed. In many instances _post-mortems_ are made, and an inquest held;\r\nbut in other cases the opinion of the attendant doctor, that the death\r\nis due to heart-disease, syncope, asphyxia, coma, apoplexy, or “natural\r\ncauses,” is deemed sufficient. The friends who are called in to look at\r\nthe body will remark, “how natural and how life-like,” “how flexible\r\nthe limbs,” “how placid the face;” and, without the faintest attempt\r\nat resuscitation, arrangements are made for an early burial.\r\n\r\n[DR. WILDER ON SUDDEN DEATH.]\r\n\r\nDr. Alexander Wilder, Professor of Physiology and Psychology, in\r\na letter to the author, says:--“There are a variety of causes for\r\nsudden death. The use of tobacco is one. Another is overtaxed nervous\r\nsystem. Men of business keep on the strain till they drop from sheer\r\nexhaustion. At the base of the brain is a little nerve-ganglion, the\r\nmedulla oblongata, which, once impaired, sends death everywhere.\r\nOvertaxing the strength by study and mental stress will do this. The\r\nsolar ganglion below the diaphragm is the real vital focus of the body.\r\nIt is first to begin, last to die. A blow on it often kills. An emotion\r\nwill paralyse it. Even undue excess at a meal, or the use of overmuch\r\nalcohol, may produce the effect.\r\n\r\n“Tobacco impairs the action of the heart. An overfull stomach\r\nparalyses the ganglionic store, and breathing is likely to stop. It is\r\ndangerous in such cases to lie on the back. All these deaths are by\r\nheart-failure.” It is syncope where the heart fails first; asphyxia\r\nwhere the lungs are first to cease; coma when the brain is first\r\nat fault. “Natural causes” and “heart-failure” usually mean, like\r\n“congestion,” that the doctor’s ideas are vague.\r\n\r\nDr. Wilder continues:--“I would choose such a death if I could be sure\r\nit was death. _But most of those things which I have enumerated may\r\ncause a death which is only apparent._”\r\n\r\nThe following briefly extracted cases from English papers are typical\r\nof thousands of others, and can be duplicated, with slight variation\r\nin terms, throughout the United States. The absolute proof of the\r\nreality of such deaths is not found in hasty diagnosis or in medical\r\ncertificates, but in the presence of putrefaction:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “SUDDEN DEATH AT ST.

All medical practitioners allow that a man may\r\nbe half drowned or half dead, and that cases of suspended animation\r\noccur where the most experienced physician is unable to detect the\r\nfaintest indication of breathing or cardiac movement. They are,\r\nhowever, quite sceptical as to absolute suspensions of life where all\r\nthe ordinary methods to test its existence fail; and, owing to this\r\nscepticism, and the readiness to give certificates of death in cases of\r\nalleged sudden death, have unwittingly promoted premature burials, as\r\nwill appear by the facts quoted in these pages.\r\n\r\n[HASTY BURIAL CONDEMNED.]\r\n\r\nMr. M. Cooper, in the “Uncertainty of the Signs of Death,” p. 49,\r\ncites from a letter by one William Fabri, a surgeon, the opinion that\r\nwe “... have just reason to condemn the too precipitate interment of\r\npersons overpowered by lethargies, apoplexies, or suffocation of the\r\nmatrix; for I know there have been some, supposed to be irretrievably\r\ncut off by these disorders, who, resuming strength and returning to\r\nlife, have raised the boards of their own coffins, because in such\r\ndisorders the soul only retires, as it were, to her most secret and\r\nconcealed residence, in order to make the body afterwards sensible\r\nthat she had not entirely forsaken it.” These wise counsels were\r\nwritten two hundred and sixty-eight years ago, since which time\r\nthousands of our fellow-creatures have, it is feared, been the victims\r\nof premature interment, and yet the danger then pointed out remains.\r\nThe _Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal_, the conductors of\r\nwhich are laudably anxious to keep their profession from the odium\r\nof burying people alive, referring to sudden deaths and this danger,\r\nsays, in its issue of January 24, 1894, under the head of “A Burning\r\nQuestion”:--“Sufferers from such chronic ailments as are reputed to\r\nend suddenly are in constant danger from the present state of the\r\nlaw, if they are in the hands of people interested in their death.”\r\nAnd continues: “Even where a medical certificate is obtained, such\r\ngeneral laxity has entered into proceedings that but little protection\r\nis thereby afforded to the public. While the medical man is bound\r\nto state what he believes to be the cause of death, he is under no\r\nobligation to make sure either that the patient is dead at all, or\r\nthat, if dead, he died from a particular disease for which he was\r\nattending him.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVIVISECTION.\r\n\r\nThe _Medical Times and Gazette_, 1859, vol. xviii., p. 256, has the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “A CRIMINAL’S HEART.\r\n\r\n “We find in an account taken from the ‘Boston Medical and Surgical\r\n Journal’ some observations on the heart of a hanged criminal,\r\n which are remarkable in a moral point of view, as well as in their\r\n scientific aspect. The man died, it appears, as the phrase is, without\r\n a struggle; and, therefore, probably in the first instance, he fell\r\n into a syncope. The lungs and brain were found normal. Seven minutes\r\n after suspension, the heart’s sounds were distinctly heard, its\r\n pulsations being one hundred a minute; two minutes later they were\r\n ninety-eight; and in three minutes sixty, and very feeble. In two\r\n minutes more the sounds became inaudible. The man was suspended at ten\r\n o’clock, and his body was cut down twenty-five minutes afterwards.\r\n There was then neither sound nor impulse. At 10.40 the cord was\r\n relaxed, and then the face became gradually pale; the spinal cord was\r\n uninjured.... At 11.30 a regular movement of pulsation was observed in\r\n the right subclavian vein; and on applying the ear to the chest, there\r\n was heard a regular, distinct, and single beat, accompanied with a\r\n slight impulse. Hereupon Drs.. Clark, Ellis, and Shaw open the thorax,\r\n and expose the heart, which still continues to beat! The right auricle\r\n contracted and dilated with energy and regularity. At twelve o’clock\r\n the pulsations were forty in a minute; at 1.45 five per minute. They\r\n ceased at 2.45; but irritability did not entirely disappear until\r\n 3.18, more than five hours after suspension. ‘This fact,’ says M.\r\n Séquard, ‘demonstrates that in a man, unfortunately, even when syncope\r\n exists for some minutes at the commencement of strangulation, the\r\n ventricles of the heart cease to beat almost as quickly as they do\r\n in strangulation without syncope.’ With regard to the moral aspects\r\n of this case, the same gentleman remarks:--‘People will probably be\r\n surprised that the body of this man should have been opened while the\r\n beating of the heart was still audible. We will not ask here if the\r\n doctors committed or not a blamable action; we will only say that\r\n we know them personally, and that, if they have in part merited the\r\n violent reproaches addressed to them, they are, nevertheless, _hommes\r\n de cœur_, who, in an excess of scientific zeal, did not notice that\r\n the body upon which they experimented was not, perhaps, at the time a\r\n dead body.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNCOPE.\r\n\r\nThe deaths attributed to syncope in the Registrar-General’s reports for\r\nEngland and Wales during the last six years are:--\r\n\r\n            MALES.      FEMALES.\r\n  1888        817           896\r\n  1889        939           922\r\n  1890      1,237         1,250\r\n  1891      1,355         1,301\r\n  1892        941           943\r\n  1893        848           770\r\n\r\n[DEATHS ATTRIBUTED TO SYNCOPE.]\r\n\r\nSyncope, however, is not a disease, though often certified as such,\r\nbut is merely a symptom of certain maladies, or a manifestation of\r\nsuspended animation from unascertained cause. In Hoblyn’s “Dictionary\r\nof Medical Terms,” p. 632, syncope is described as--“Fainting or swoon;\r\na sudden suspension of the heart’s action, accompanied by cessation\r\nof the functions of the organs of respiration, internal and external\r\nsensation, and voluntary motion.” There appears, therefore, every\r\nprobability that, with careless or ignorant medical practitioners,\r\nsyncope is not seldom mistaken for trance, and a certificate of death\r\nmay be given where there is merely a suspension and not a termination\r\nof life; and this probability is reduced to a certainty when we\r\nlearn the number of premature burials and narrow escapes reported by\r\nWinslow, Bruhier, Köppen, E. Bouchut, Lénormand, F. Kempner, Moore\r\nRussell Fletcher, Gannal, Gaubert, Hartmann, and other recognised\r\nauthorities. Dr. James Curry, Senior Physician to Guy’s Hospital, and\r\nLecturer on the Theory and Practice of Medicine, in the introduction\r\nto his “Observations on Apparent Death,” London, 1815, 2 ed., p. 1,\r\nsays--“The time is still within the recollection of many now living\r\nwhen it was almost universally believed that _life_ quitted the body in\r\na very few minutes after the person had ceased to breathe. Remarkable\r\nexamples to the contrary were, indeed, upon record; but these, besides\r\nbeing extremely rare, were generally cases wherein the _suspension_,\r\nas well as the _recovery of life_, had occurred _spontaneously_; they\r\nwere, therefore, beheld with astonishment, as particular instances of\r\nDivine Interposition.” It is believed that the majority of the members\r\nof the medical profession still entertain the idea that a human being\r\nis dead when breathing can no longer be detected, as in the cases of\r\nreported sudden deaths; and, except in those which occur from drowning,\r\nor suffocation through noxious gases, attempts are very rarely made\r\nto promote restoration, and, unless they return to life spontaneously\r\nwhile above ground, there are good reasons to fear that an appreciable\r\nnumber do so under ground. The prevailing belief in the existence of\r\nsudden deaths is one of the chief causes of the terrible mistakes\r\nthat lead to live burials. If this delusive idea were removed, those\r\nconcerned, such as physicians, undertakers, relatives, and friends,\r\nwould treat a person who unexpectedly took on the appearance of death\r\nas one needing careful attention by physician and nurse to bring him\r\nround to health again, as is usually done in cases of fainting. If\r\ntrance were understood, doctors would be on the lookout for it; but,\r\nas it is not understood, it is called death, and we bury our mistakes\r\nunder ground.\r\n\r\nDr. Hilton Fagge, while doubting whether there is any foundation for\r\nthe strong fear which many persons entertain of being buried alive\r\nafter supposed death, allows that there is danger in cases of sudden\r\ndeath. In his “Principles and Practice of Medicine,” Dr. Fagge says:\r\n“The cases really requiring caution are some very few instances of\r\npersons found in the streets, or losing consciousness unexpectedly and\r\nin unusual circumstances.”[13]\r\n\r\nDr. Léonce Lénormand, in “Des Inhumations Précipitées,” p. 86, says\r\nthat medical archives record details of a great number of apoplectic\r\ncases revived after one, two, and three days’ apparent death; and\r\nobserves that the most celebrated physicians, both ancient and modern,\r\nagree in recommending delay in the burial of persons who succumb to\r\nthis affliction.\r\n\r\nDr. Franz Hartmann, in his “Premature Burial,” p. 11, quotes the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n[REVIVAL AFTER APPARENT DEATH.]\r\n\r\n “In the Bukovina, a young woman, in the vicinity of Radautz, died of\r\n spasms of the heart. They waited five days for the funeral, because no\r\n signs of putrefaction appeared. The clergyman then refused any longer\r\n delay, and the final arrangements for interment were made. Just as\r\n they were about to put the coffin into the grave, the sister of the\r\n deceased woman, who lived at another place, arrived, and begged to be\r\n permitted to see the dead body. Owing to her entreaties the coffin was\r\n opened, and as the woman saw the unaltered features of her sister,\r\n she asserted her belief that the supposed dead was still living.\r\n She procured a red-hot poker, and, in spite of the remonstrances\r\n of those present, she touched with it the soles of the feet of the\r\n corpse. There was a spasmodic jerk, and the woman recovered. The\r\n most remarkable thing was that the supposed dead woman had not been\r\n unconscious for a moment, but was able to describe afterwards all the\r\n details of what had taken place around her, from the moment when she\r\n was supposed to die up to the time of her recovery; but she had looked\r\n upon all that like an unconscious spectator, and not experienced any\r\n sensation, nor was she able to give any sign of life.”\r\n\r\nIn “Les Signes de la Mort,” by Dr. E. Bouchut, p. 51, Dr. J. Schmid is\r\ncited for the case of a girl, seven years of age, who, while playing\r\nwith her companions, fell suddenly down (as if struck by lightning),\r\nand died. There was paleness, absence of pulse, insensibility to\r\nall stimulus. Nevertheless, owing to the requests of the distressed\r\nparents, the apparently hopeless attempts at resuscitation were\r\ncontinued. After three quarters of an hour the girl gave a sigh and\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\n[DR. WATERMAN’S CASE.]\r\n\r\nThe _Medical Record_, New York, 1883, vol. xxiii., p. 236, contains\r\na paper on “Revivification” (in cases of sudden apparent death from\r\nheart-disease, and in the still-born), by S. Waterman, M.D., New York\r\nCase 1, February, 1880.--Mr. B----, aged 84, suffered from valvular\r\ndisease of the heart, and likewise from Bright’s disease. “One morning,\r\nwhile I was sitting at his bedside and in friendly conversation with\r\nhim, he being to all appearance in a very happy mood of mind, he\r\nsuddenly fell back, his eyes became fixed and glassy, a deadly pallor\r\ncrept over his countenance, respiration and the heart’s action ceased\r\nsimultaneously, and death seemed to have carried him off suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly. It was this suddenness of the event that impelled me to\r\nmake efforts at revivification. Two nephews of Mrs. B----, who were\r\nfortunately in the house, were brought under requisition, and, under\r\nmy direction, systematic artificial movements were carried on for\r\nnearly thirty minutes, when one deep inspiratory effort was made by\r\nthe patient himself. Thus encouraged, we redoubled our efforts for ten\r\nminutes more; other inspiratory efforts followed in quicker succession;\r\nthe heart began to respond. Hardly audible at first, it acquired force\r\nand momentum; it could now be felt at the wrist; the deadly pallor\r\npassed away, the eyes lost their glassy, fixed aspect, sighs and groans\r\ncould be heard, twitchings of the muscles of the arm and fingers\r\ncould be distinctly felt, and the appearances of death made way for\r\nreanimated conditions. He lay unconscious for more than ten hours,\r\nrespiration being hurried, and breathing stertorous, the heart’s action\r\nwild and irregular. During the night he was delirious and restless;\r\ntoward morning all untoward symptoms subsided, and a quiet sleep\r\nfollowed the extreme restlessness.... He died six weeks afterwards,\r\nunder symptoms of uræmic toxication. During these six weeks he had\r\nseveral other attacks--one very prolonged and almost fatal--in which\r\nartificial respiration was resorted to with the same success.”\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Manchester Criterion_, December 11, 1895,\r\nsays:--“Many cases of sudden death have been entombed who were really\r\nalive, so far as the union of the body and soul is concerned. Sudden\r\ndisappearance of life is very common, due to excessive weakness or a\r\npartial cessation of the heart’s action; and doctors should be very\r\nchary in giving death-certificates until it has been ascertained\r\nthat decomposition has ensued. Many object to this delay, and on the\r\napproach of an indication of death, or apparent death, often hurry the\r\nbody to the grave. We know of a young lady, for whom the shroud was\r\nbought, and the crape fastened on the door, who was restored to life.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSUDDEN DEATH.\r\n\r\nProfessor Alexander Wilder, M.D., in “Perils of Premature Burial,” p.\r\n16, says:--“In this country (America), however, the peril of interment\r\nbefore death has actually taken place is very great. For years past\r\nit has been a very common occurrence for persons in supposed good\r\nhealth to fall down suddenly, with every appearance of having died. We\r\ndo not regard sudden death with terror, as it is so often painless,\r\nand exempts the individual from the anxiety and other unpleasant\r\nexperiences which so often accompany a lingering dissolution. But\r\nthere is a terrible liability of being prostrated by catalepsy, the\r\ncounterpart of death, under such circumstances that those who have the\r\nbody in charge will not hesitate about a prompt interment.”\r\n\r\n[PREVENTIVE LEGISLATION.]\r\n\r\n“The difficulty of distinguishing a person apparently dead from one\r\nwho is _really_ so has, in all countries where bodies are interred\r\nprecipitately, rendered it necessary for the law to assist humanity.\r\nOf several regulations made on this subject, a few of the most recent\r\nmay suffice--such as those of Arras in 1772; of Mantua in 1774; of\r\nthe Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1775; of the Senechaussée of Sivrai in\r\nPoitou in 1777; and of the Parliament of Metz in the same year....\r\nThese edicts forbid the precipitate interment of persons who die\r\nsuddenly. Magistrates of health are to be informed, that physicians\r\nmay examine the body; that they may use every endeavour to recall\r\nlife, if possible, or to discover the cause of death.”--_Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica, quoted by John Snart in Apparent Death, 1824, pp. 81-82._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE absence of respiration is the most ordinary sign of death, but at\r\nthe same time perhaps the one most likely to deceive. To ascertain\r\nwhether breathing be entirely suspended, it is a practice to hold a\r\nlooking-glass to the face.\r\n\r\n                “Lend me a looking-glass;\r\n  If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,\r\n  Why, then, she lives.”--_King Lear_, Act v., Sc. 3.\r\n\r\nThe common belief is that, if the operations of the heart or lungs be\r\narrested for ever so brief a period, they will never be resumed, and\r\nupon a hasty diagnosis and perhaps a trifling experiment the person\r\nis declared dead. It would appear presumptuous to attempt to doubt or\r\ndeny a theory so widely accepted by both the lay and medical world, but\r\nnumerous well-attested facts show that the action of the vital organs,\r\nwith life itself, may occasionally be actually suspended, as proved by\r\nthe most rigorous tests known to science, and that various forms of\r\nsuspended animation taking on the appearance of actual death are of\r\nnot unfrequent occurrence. Scepticism, prejudice, and apathy on this\r\nsubject have led to thousands of persons being consigned to the grave\r\nto return to consciousness in that hopeless and dreadful prison.\r\n\r\n[VARIOUS TESTS CONSIDERED.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguished physicians in London informed the author\r\nthat, being called in to decide a case of apparent or real death, he\r\nhad applied the stethoscope and failed to detect the faintest pulsation\r\nin the heart, and yet the woman recovered. The danger of premature\r\nburial he believed to be very real and by no means an imaginary one,\r\nand his opinions were well known in the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESPIRATORY TEST.\r\n\r\nSir Benjamin Ward Richardson, in his paper on “The Absolute Signs and\r\nProofs of Death,” in the _Asclepiad_, No. 21 (1889), vol. vi., p. 6,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n“About the existence of respiratory movements there is always some\r\ncause for doubt, even amongst skilled observers; for so slight a\r\nmovement of respiration is sufficient to carry on life, at what I have\r\nin another paper designated ‘life at low tension,’ the most practised\r\neye is apt to be deceived.”\r\n\r\n“The cessation of the indications of respiratory function, although\r\nuseful in a general sense, is not by any means reliable. It is quite\r\ncertain that in poisoning by chloral, and in catalepsy, there may be\r\nlife when no external movement of the chest is appreciable.”--_Ibidem,\r\npp. 13, 14._\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDIAC AND ARTERIAL FAILURE TEST.\r\n\r\n“Equal doubt attends the absence of the arterial pulsations and heart\r\nsounds. It is quite certain that the pulses of the body, as well as the\r\nmovements and sounds of the heart, may be undetectable at a time when\r\nthe body is not only not dead but actually recoverable.”--_Ibidem, p.\r\n14._\r\n\r\nIn a review of several works on the “Signs of Death” in _The British\r\nand Foreign Medical and Chirurgical Review_, vol. XV. [1855], p. 74,\r\nW. B. Kesteven writes that Bouchut’s test of the cessation of the\r\naction of the heart for one or two minutes is not to be relied upon\r\nas a certain sign of death. “M. Josat has recorded several instances\r\nwherein newly-born children have been most carefully examined during\r\nseveral minutes without the detection of the slightest cardial sound or\r\nmovement, and yet these have rallied and lived. M. Depaul has collected\r\nten similar instances. M. Brachet has recorded[14] an instance of a\r\nman in whom neither sound nor movement of the heart could be heard for\r\neight minutes, and who, nevertheless, survived. Another adult case\r\nis mentioned by Dr. Josat as having been witnessed by M. Girbal, of\r\nMontpellier.... Sir B. Brodie and others have described children born\r\nwithout hearts. The circulation is maintained at one period of human\r\nlife without the aid of the heart. It is, besides, quite consistent\r\nwith the facts observed in hysterical and other conditions of the\r\nnervous system, that the action of the heart, like that of other\r\nmuscles, should be so extremely feeble as not to be cognisable by any\r\nsound or impulse, and yet it may have sufficient movement slowly to\r\nmove the blood through the system, whose every function and endowment\r\nis suspended and all but annihilated. In cases of catalepsy, and of\r\nauthentic instances of apparent death, the respiratory muscles have not\r\nbeen seen to move, yet inspiration and expiration--however slowly and\r\nimperceptibly--must have taken place.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUTREFACTIVE TEST.\r\n\r\n[THE PUTREFACTIVE TEST.]\r\n\r\nDr. Roger S. Chew, of Calcutta, whose personal experiences of apparent\r\ndeath are elsewhere recorded in this volume, says:--\r\n\r\n“Numerous expedients have been suggested as means of ascertaining\r\nwhether a body is really dead or whether the animation is temporarily\r\nsuspended; but, though these suggestions may collectively yield a\r\ncorrect diagnosis, still they are valueless when separately considered,\r\nand cannot compare with the ‘putrefaction test.’”\r\n\r\nIn the “Principles and Practice of Medicine” of the late Dr. Hilton\r\nFagge, edited by Dr. Pye-Smith, vol. i., p. 19, of the second edition,\r\nis the following:--\r\n\r\n“In most cases there is no difficulty in determining the exact moment\r\nat which death occurs. But sometimes it cannot be fixed with certainty,\r\nand there are some altogether exceptional instances (though I have\r\nnever myself met with one) in which for hours, or even for days, it\r\nremains uncertain whether life is extinct or merely suspended. _I\r\nbelieve that the only sign of death which is both certain to manifest\r\nitself in the course of a few days, and also absolutely conclusive and\r\ninfallible, is the occurrence of putrefaction_, which is generally\r\nfirst indicated by discoloration of the surface of the abdomen. And in\r\nany case admitting of doubt, the coffin should not be closed until this\r\nhas shown itself.” (Italics ours.)\r\n\r\nThe _Medical Examiner_, Philadelphia, vol. vi., p. 610, says:--\r\n\r\n“A recent French reviewer in the _Gazette Médicale_ closes a survey\r\nof the differences between real and apparent death, by the following\r\nremarks:--‘Experience,’ says he, ‘has shown the insufficiency of\r\neach of these signs, with one exception--_putrefaction_. The absence\r\nof respiration and circulation, the absence of contractility and\r\nsensibility, general loss of heat, the hippocratic face, the cold\r\nsweat spreading over the body, cadaveric discoloration, relaxation of\r\nthe sphincters, loss of elasticity, the flattening of the soft parts\r\non which the body rests, the softness and flaccidity of the eyes, the\r\nopacity of the fingers, cadaveric rigidity, the expulsion of alimentary\r\nsubstances from the mouth;--all these signs combined or isolated may\r\npresent themselves in an individual suffering only from apparent\r\ndeath.’”\r\n\r\nProf. D. Ferrier, in an article on “Signs of Death” in Quain’s\r\n“Dictionary of Medicine,” pp. 327, 328, says:--\r\n\r\n“It is not always easy to determine when the spark of life has become\r\nfinally extinguished. From fear of being buried alive, which prevails\r\nmore abroad than in this country, some infallible criterion of death,\r\ncapable of being applied by unskilled persons, has been considered\r\na desideratum, and valuable prizes have been offered for such a\r\ndiscovery. The conditions most resembling actual death are syncope,\r\nasphyxia, and trance, particularly the last. We cannot, however,\r\nsay that any infallible criterion applicable by the vulgar has been\r\ndiscovered.”\r\n\r\nThe writer then proceeds to describe the various symptoms usually\r\nconsidered to denote death. The chief of these is putrefaction, but he\r\nobserves that putrefaction may occur locally during life, and general\r\nseptic changes may occur to some extent before death.\r\n\r\nDr. Gannal, in “Signes de la Mort,” p. 31, says:--\r\n\r\n“I share the opinion of the majority of authors who have written on\r\nthis subject, and I consider _putrefaction_ as the only certain sign of\r\ndeath.” The author then shows that all other signs are uncertain, and\r\nadds “that it is possible, by taking certain measures, to wait until\r\nputrefaction is well manifest, without injuring the public health.” If\r\nthe attending medical practitioner could always be relied upon to look\r\nfor any such combination of signs as above suggested, there would be\r\nmuch less danger of premature burial than at present almost everywhere\r\nprevails; but personal investigation obliges the author deliberately to\r\ndeclare that these are looked for only in a comparatively few instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RIGOR MORTIS._\r\n\r\n[RIGOR MORTIS.]\r\n\r\nWith reference to _rigor mortis_, one of the signs many physicians\r\nregard as infallible as putrefaction, and to which the _British Medical\r\nJournal_ attaches much importance, I cite the following:--\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel Barker Pratt says that _rigor mortis_, which is regarded as\r\nan absolute proof of death, is in itself a life-action, caused by a\r\ngradual withdrawal of the nerve-forces from the body, and is distinctly\r\nakin to, and the same in effect as, the tightening of a muscle, and\r\nother similar physiological actions in the living body.\r\n\r\nDr. Roger S. Chew observes:--\r\n\r\n“_Rigor mortis_ is a condition that seldom or never supervenes in the\r\nhot weather in India, and is often a feature of catalepsy.\r\n\r\n“Ecchymoses, or _post-mortem_ stains, are sometimes of value, but very\r\nfrequently they do not appear, even though there are strong evidences\r\nof putrefaction having set in, and in some cases this cadaveric\r\nlividity, as it is termed, may be the result of violence received\r\nbefore animation was suspended, and, the vital spark not having been\r\nextinguished though the body was apparently dead, echymosis had\r\nasserted itself as a process of life, and not death.”\r\n\r\nEbenezer Milner, M.D.Edinb., L.R.C.S.E., observes in a paper on\r\n“Catalepsy or Trance” in the _Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal_,\r\n1850, vol. lxxiv., p. 330:--\r\n\r\n“Patients labouring under an intense and prolonged paroxysm of\r\ncatalepsy have been supposed to be dead, and have been interred alive.\r\n\r\n[VARIOUS OTHER TESTS.]\r\n\r\n“There are numerous cases of this kind on record, and many more where\r\nindividuals, after being laid in their coffins, have fortunately\r\nrecovered from the attack before the period of interment. In such\r\ncases respiration is insensible, and the heart’s action is almost in\r\nabeyance; the surface of the body is nearly cold, and presents the\r\npallor of death; and the articulations are stiff. Although it is no\r\ndoubt a difficult task to distinguish this state of trance from the\r\nstate of death, yet a careful examination of the body, and time, would\r\nlead to a correct diagnosis. The limbs after death are first lax, then\r\nstiff, and ultimately lax again. The stiffness of the limbs, known\r\nas the cadaveric rigidity, or _rigor mortis_, lasts for a longer or\r\nshorter time, according to circumstances; the sooner it supervenes, the\r\nshorter is its duration, and conversely. Now the stiffness of the limbs\r\naccompanying this intense form of trance supervenes at once, and lasts\r\nas long as the paroxysm continues. This is consequently a valuable\r\ndiagnostic sign.”\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that only in rare and very exceptional cases is time\r\nallowed for careful and accurate diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nCADAVEROUS COUNTENANCE.\r\n\r\nAnthony Fothergill, in “A New Inquiry,” 1795, p. 92:--\r\n\r\n“Nor can even the cadaverous countenance be, separately considered,\r\nan infallible test of life’s total extinction. Nay, even putrefaction\r\nitself, though allowed to be the most unequivocal sign of death, might\r\nchance to deceive us in that syncope which sometimes supervenes on the\r\nlast stage of the confluent small-pox, sea-scurvy, or other highly\r\nputrid diseases.”\r\n\r\n\r\nREGARDING CLENCHED JAWS.\r\n\r\nA. de Labordette, Chirurgien de l’Hôpital de Lisieux, states in a\r\nletter to the Secretary of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution:--\r\n\r\n“I have collected manifold observations relating to persons drowned or\r\nasphyxiated, in whose case contraction of the jaws was remarked, and\r\nwho were subsequently restored to life,” Dr. Brown-Séquard concurred in\r\nthis, and declared further that such contraction is rather a sign of\r\nlife than of death.--_Lancet, 1870, vol. i., p. 436._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAPHANOUS TEST,\r\n\r\nfor the discovery of which a prize was given by the French Academy\r\nof Medicine, is regarded by Sir B. Ward Richardson as of secondary\r\nimportance. It has certainly failed in many instances.\r\n\r\nThe following communication on\r\n\r\n  THE PROPER VALUE OF THE DIAPHANOUS\r\n  TEST OF DEATH,\r\n\r\nby Edwin Haward, M.D.Edin., F.R.C.S.Eng., appears in the _Lancet_ of\r\nJune 10, 1893, p. 1404:--\r\n\r\n[THE DIAPHANOUS TEST.]\r\n\r\n“A case has come lately under my observation in which the value of\r\nthe diaphanous test of death has been illustrated at its just worth,\r\nand, as the matter is one of supreme practical moment, I think it may\r\nbe considered deserving a brief notice in the pages of the _Lancet_.\r\nReaders of the _Lancet_ need scarcely be informed that the diaphanous\r\ntest consists in taking a hand of a supposed dead person, placing\r\nit before a strong artificial light, with the fingers extended and\r\njust touching each other, and then looking through the narrow spaces\r\nbetween the fingers to see if there be there a scarlet line of light.\r\nThe theory is that if there be such a line of scarlet colour there is\r\nsome circulation still in progress, and therefore evidence of vital\r\naction, whilst if there be no illumination, then the circulation has\r\nceased and death has occurred. The French Academy of Medicine was so\r\nimpressed with the value of this test that it awarded, I believe, to\r\nthe discoverer of it a considerable prize. The illustration I am about\r\nto give indicates, however, that this test must be received with the\r\nutmost caution. The facts run as follows:--I was called in January last\r\nto visit a lady seventy-three years of age, suffering from chronic\r\nbronchitis. She had often suffered at intervals from similar attacks\r\nduring a period of twenty-five years. The present attack was very\r\nsevere, and as she was obviously in a state of senile decrepitude her\r\nsymptoms naturally gave rise to considerable anxiety. Nevertheless, she\r\nrallied and improved so much that after a few days my attendance was\r\nno longer required. I heard nothing more of this lady until February\r\n6--a period of three weeks--when I was summoned early in the morning\r\nto see her immediately. The messenger told me that she had retired\r\nto bed in the usual way, and had apparently died in the night, but\r\nthat she looked so life-like there was great doubt whether death had\r\nactually taken place. Within half an hour I was by her bedside; there\r\nwas no sign of breathing, of pulse, or of heart-beat, and the hands,\r\nslightly flexed, were rather rigid, but the countenance looked like\r\nthat of a living person, the eyes being open and life-like. I believed\r\nher to be dead, and that the rigidity of the upper limbs indicated\r\ncommencing _rigor mortis_; but this curious fact was related to me by\r\na near relative, that once before she had passed into a death-like\r\nstate, with similar symptoms, even to the rigidity of the arms and\r\nhands, from which state she had recovered, and after which she had\r\nalways experienced the direst apprehension of being buried alive. Her\r\nanxiety, it will be easily conceived, was readily communicated to her\r\nrelatives, who urged me to leave nothing undone for determining whether\r\nlife was or was not extinct. Under the circumstances I suggested\r\nthat Dr. (now Sir) Benjamin Ward Richardson, who has made the proofs\r\nof death a special study, should be summoned. He soon arrived, and\r\nsubmitted the body to all the tests in the following order:--1. Heart\r\nsounds and motion entirely absent, together with all pulse movement.\r\n2. Respiratory sounds and movements entirely absent. 3. Temperature\r\nof the body taken from the mouth the same as that in the surrounding\r\nair in the room, 62° F. 4. A bright needle plunged into the body of\r\nthe biceps muscle (Cloquet’s needle test) and left there shows on\r\nwithdrawal no sign of oxidation. 5. Intermittent shocks of electricity\r\nat different tensions passed by needles into various muscles and\r\ngroups of muscles gave no indication whatever of irritability. 6. The\r\nfillet-test applied to the veins of the arm (Richardson’s test) causes\r\nno filling of veins on the distal side of the fillet. 7. The opening\r\nof a vein to ascertain whether the blood has undergone coagulation\r\nshows that the blood was still fluid. 8. The subcutaneous injection of\r\nammonia (Monteverdi’s test) causes the dirty brown stain indicative\r\nof dissolution. 9. On making careful movements of the joints of the\r\nextremities, of the lower jaw, and of the occipito-frontals, _rigor\r\nmortis_ is found in several parts. Thus of these nine tests eight\r\ndistinctly declared that death was absolute; the exception, the\r\nfluidity of the blood, being a phenomenon quite compatible with blood\r\npreternaturally fluid and at a low temperature, even though death had\r\noccurred. 10. There now remained the diaphanous test, which we carried\r\nout by the aid of a powerful reflector lamp, yielding an excellent and\r\npenetrating light. To our surprise the scarlet line of light between\r\nthe fingers was as distinct as it was in our own hands subjected to the\r\nsame experiment. The mass of evidence was of course distinctly to the\r\neffect that death was complete; but, to make assurance doubly sure, we\r\nhad the temperature of the room raised and the body carefully watched\r\nuntil signs of decomposition had set in. I made a visit myself on a\r\nsucceeding day to assure myself of this fact.\r\n\r\n[INADEQUACY OF DIAPHANOUS TEST.]\r\n\r\n“The results of these experimental tests were satisfactory, as\r\nfollowing and corroborating each other in eight out of the ten\r\ndifferent lines of procedure; but the point of my paper is to show the\r\nutter inadequacy of the diaphanous test, upon which some are inclined\r\nentirely to rely. Sir Benjamin Richardson has reported an instance in\r\nwhich the test applied to the hand of a lady who had simply fainted\r\ngave no evidence of the red line; she therefore, on that test alone,\r\nmight have been declared dead. In my case the reverse was presented;\r\nthe body was dead, whilst the red line supposed to indicate life was\r\nperfectly visible. Hence the test might possibly lead to a double\r\nerror, and ought never of itself to be relied upon.\r\n\r\n“It is a question worthy of consideration whether the colouration\r\nobserved was due to the fluid state of the blood after death; it is not\r\nunreasonable to suppose so but I prefer merely to offer the suggestion\r\nwithout further comment.”\r\n\r\nDr. Gannal, in his “Signes de la Mort,” p. 54, says:--\r\n\r\n“The loss of transparency of the fingers is an uncertain sign, because\r\nwith certain subjects it takes place some time before death; next,\r\nbecause it does not always occur in the corpse; and finally, because\r\nit exists under certain circumstances in sick persons--in intermittent\r\nfever, for example, when the skin loses colour, the hands get cold, and\r\nthe nails blue, as happens at the onset of the fits.”\r\n\r\nOrfila, “Médicine Légale,” vol. i., p. 478, 4th edit., observes:--\r\n\r\n“This sign can be of no use, because it is easy to prove that the\r\nfingers of corpses placed between the eye and the flame of a candle are\r\ntransparent, even when this experiment is made one or two days after\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nSir Benjamin Ward Richardson read a paper before the Medical Society\r\nof London on “The Absolute Signs and Proofs of Death,” published (in\r\n1889) in No. 21 of the _Asclepiad_. The circumstance which originated\r\nhis investigation was a case of the revival of an apparently dead\r\nchild immediately before the funeral. Dr. Richardson has seen persons\r\napparently dead, and presenting all the signs of death, but who were\r\nreally living. Amongst these he cites the following:--\r\n\r\n“A medical man found dead, as it was presumed, from an excessive dose\r\nof chloral. To all common observation this gentleman was dead. There\r\nwas no sign of respiration; it was very difficult for an ear so long\r\ntrained as my own to detect the sounds of the heart; there was no pulse\r\nat the wrist, and the temperature of the body had fallen to 97° Fahr.\r\nIn this condition the man had lain for some hours before my arrival;\r\nand yet, under the simple acts of raising the warmth of the room to 84°\r\nFahr. and injecting warm milk and water into the stomach, he rallied\r\nslowly out of the sleep, and made a perfect recovery.”\r\n\r\nMore remarkable is the case of a man struck by lightning, details of\r\nwhich Sir Benjamin received, in 1869, from Dr. Jackson, of Somerby,\r\nLeicestershire.\r\n\r\n“The patient reached his home in a state of extreme prostration, in\r\nwhich he lay for a time, and then sank into such complete catalepsy\r\nthat he was pronounced to be dead, and heard the sound of his own\r\npassing bell from the neighbouring church; by a desperate attempt at\r\nmovement of his thumbs he attracted the attention of the women engaged\r\nabout him, and, being treated as one still alive, recovered, and lived\r\nfor several years afterwards, retaining in his memory the facts, and\r\nrelating them with the most consistent accuracy.”\r\n\r\n[SIR B. W. RICHARDSON’S ENUMERATION.]\r\n\r\nMedical practitioners tell us that the signs of death are quite easy\r\nand impossible to mistake. Dr. Richardson, who has had the best of\r\nreasons, as already shown, for observation and investigation, holds a\r\ndifferent opinion, and enumerates the signs of death as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Respiratory failure, including absence of visible movements of\r\nthe chest, absence of the respiratory murmur, absence of evidence of\r\ntranspiration of water vapour from the lungs by the breath.\r\n\r\n(2) Cardiac failure, including absence of arterial pulsation, of\r\ncardiac motion, and of cardiac sounds.\r\n\r\n(3) Absence of turgescence or filling of the veins on making pressure\r\nbetween them and the heart.\r\n\r\n(4) Reduction of the temperature of the body below the natural standard.\r\n\r\n(5) Rigor mortis and muscular collapse.\r\n\r\n(6) Coagulation of the blood.\r\n\r\n(7) Putrefactive decomposition.\r\n\r\n(8) Absence of red colour in semi-transparent parts under the influence\r\nof a powerful stream of light.\r\n\r\n(9) Absence of muscular contraction under the stimulus of galvanism, of\r\nheat, and of puncture.\r\n\r\n(10) Absence of red blush of the skin after subcutaneous injection of\r\nammonia (Monteverdi’s test).\r\n\r\n(11) Absence of signs of rust or oxidation of a bright steel blade,\r\nafter plunging it deep into the tissues. (The needle test of Cloquet\r\nand Laborde.)\r\n\r\nSir Benjamin sums up as follows:--\r\n\r\n“If all these signs point to death--if there be no indications of\r\nrespiratory function; if there be no signs of movement of the pulse\r\nor heart, and no sounds of the heart; if the veins of the hand do\r\nnot enlarge on the distal side of the fillet; if the blood in the\r\nveins contains a coagulum; if the galvanic stimulus fails to produce\r\nmuscular contraction; if the injection of ammonia causes a dirty\r\nbrown blotch--the evidence may be considered conclusive that death is\r\nabsolute. If these signs leave any doubt, or even if they leave no\r\ndoubt, one further point of practice should be carried out. The body\r\nshould be kept in a room, the temperature of which has been raised to a\r\nheat of 84° Fahr., with moisture diffused through the air; and in this\r\nwarm and moist atmosphere it should remain until distinct indications\r\nof putrefactive decomposition have set in.”\r\n\r\nDr. Franz Hartmann, whose recent monograph[15] has excited much\r\nattention both in the English and American Press, observes:--\r\n\r\n“Apparent death is a state that resembles real death so closely that\r\neven the most experienced persons believe such a person to be really\r\ndead. In many cases not even the most experienced physician, coroner,\r\nor undertaker can distinguish a case of apparent death from real\r\ndeath, neither by external examination nor by means of the stethoscope,\r\nnor by any of the various tests which have been proposed by this or\r\nthat writer, for all those tests have been proved fallible, and it\r\nis now useless to discuss them at length, because many of the most\r\nexperienced members of the medical profession have already agreed that\r\nthere is no certain sign that a person is really and not apparently\r\ndead, except the beginning of a certain stage of putrefaction. All\r\nother tests ought to be set down as delusive and unreliable.”\r\n\r\n[RULES FOR OFFICIAL INSPECTORS.]\r\n\r\nIn the Royal Decree issued by the Government for examining the dead\r\nin Würtemberg, dated January 24, 1882 (_Dienst-Vorschriften für\r\nLeichenschäuer_, Stuttgart, 1885), various signs and experiments for\r\nenabling the official inspector of deaths to ascertain if actual death\r\nhas taken place are laid down. Among these are:--\r\n\r\n(1) “The cessation of sensibility may be assumed if, on raising the\r\neyelid, the pupil remains unaltered when a lighted candle is held\r\nclose to it; or if pungent odours, such as those derived from onions,\r\nvinegar, sal-ammoniac, or severe friction of the chest, arms, or\r\nsoles of the feet, the application of mustard, or burning tinder,\r\nor if sealing-wax dropped upon the chest produces no reaction, and\r\nparticularly if in the latter case the skin does not blister.\r\n\r\n(2) “The stoppage of the circulation of the blood, apart from the\r\nabsence of heart beating, if, after tying a tight bandage around the\r\narm, the veins do not swell up, upon the hands being firmly gripped;\r\nalso if, upon pricking the lips, no blood escapes; furthermore, if, on\r\nholding the hand in front of a bright light (the diaphanous test), the\r\nfinger-tips are no longer translucent as in the living.”\r\n\r\nNor should the inspector ever neglect to examine the heart to ascertain\r\nthe complete absence of all sound, and to test the absence of breath by\r\nother experiments.\r\n\r\nThe rescript further adds that these experiments “may not furnish\r\nabsolute proof of death,” and describes what further proceedings to\r\ninstitute. These are referred to in this volume in the chapter devoted\r\nto Death Certification.\r\n\r\nAn editorial note in the _Lancet_, January 29, 1887, p. 233, shows the\r\ndifficulty of distinguishing real from\r\n\r\n\r\n[CASES FROM THE “LANCET.”]\r\n\r\nAPPARENT DEATH.\r\n\r\n“It was only last year that we commented in our columns upon the ‘signs\r\nof death,’ drawing attention to the more important criteria by which\r\na skilful observer may avoid mistaking cases of so-called suspended\r\nanimation from actual disease. Quite recently two instances have been\r\nrecorded, in which, if report be true, it would seem there is still\r\nroom for maturing the judgment upon the question herein raised. At\r\nSaumur a young man afflicted with a contagious disease apparently died\r\nsuddenly. His body was enshrouded and coffined, but as the undertaker’s\r\nmen were carrying the ‘remains’ to their last resting-place they\r\nheard what they believed to be a knocking against the coffin-lid, and\r\nthe sound was repeated in the grave. Instead of testing at once the\r\nevidence of their senses, they, in accordance with judicial custom,\r\nsent for the Mayor, in whose presence the lid was removed from the\r\ncoffin. Whereupon, to the horror of the spectators, it was observed\r\nthat the dead man had only just succumbed to asphyxia. The above\r\nnarrative seems on the face of it too ghastly to be true, especially as\r\nthe occupant of the coffin must have been shut up in a space containing\r\noxygen in quantity totally inadequate to sustain an approximation\r\nto ordinary breathing. But in cataleptic and similar states the\r\norganic functions are reduced to the lowest ebb, and history records\r\nseveral instances in which, for a time at least, the determination\r\nof the living state was a matter of uncertainty. In our issue of the\r\n15th inst., p. 129, the reader will find an account of ‘Post-mortem\r\nIrritability of Muscle,’ in which the phenomenon was manifested in a\r\nmarked degree two hours after death from a chronic wasting disorder--a\r\ncondition which favours early extinction of vital action in muscle.\r\nIt may be argued, then, with some show of reasonableness, that it\r\nis quite possible for the heart to stand still, as it were, and yet\r\nretain the power of action, although experience tells us but little on\r\nthe question as regards the human subject. Experiments on the lower\r\nanimals, however, show that over-distension of the right cavities of\r\nthe heart causes cessation of cardiac contraction, and that relief\r\nfrom the distension may be followed by resumption of the function of\r\ncontractibility. It must not be forgotten that an analogous condition\r\nis witnessed at times in patients suffering from capillary bronchitis\r\nor other physical states underlying acute distension of the right\r\nheart; for, in these cases, venesection is not uncommonly instrumental\r\nin arresting the rapidly failing cardiac contractions. The second\r\ncase of apparent death alluded to above happened in ‘the land of big\r\nthings.’ An inhabitant of Mount Joy, Paramatta, was believed to be\r\ndead, and his supposed remains were about to be committed to the\r\nearth, when a mourning relative startled the bystanders by exclaiming,\r\n‘I must see my father once more; something tells me he is not dead.’\r\nThe coffin was taken from the grave to the sexton’s tool-house, and\r\nthere opened, and was found to contain a living inmate, who justified\r\nthe presentiment of his son by ‘slowly recovering.’ As no mention is\r\nmade in either case of the period that elapsed between the occurrence\r\nof apparent death and the body being placed in the coffin, or of the\r\ntime during which the encasement lasted, special and minute criticism\r\nis uncalled for. Enough has been said on the subject to emphasize\r\nthe exhortation, ‘Get knowledge, and with all thy getting get\r\nunderstanding.’”\r\n\r\nThe _British Medical Journal_, of September 28, 1895, in a leading\r\narticle on the “Signs of Death,” says:--\r\n\r\n“The question of the possibility of the interment of living beings\r\nhas recently been exercising the minds of a portion of the public,\r\nwhose fears have found expression in a series of letters to some of\r\nthe daily papers. It is a matter of regret that so much irresponsible\r\nnonsense and such hysterical outpourings should find a place in the\r\ncolumns of our great daily press. No attempt at the production of\r\nevidence in support of their beliefs or fears has been made by the\r\nmajority of writers, whilst the cases mentioned by the few are either\r\nthe inventions of the credulous or ignorant, or are destitute of\r\nfoundation. It cannot be said that the few medical men who have joined\r\nin this public correspondence have either contributed any useful\r\ninformation or have seriously attempted to allay the fears of the\r\npublic. One medical gentleman managed to earn for himself a cheap\r\nnotoriety by employing, with very scanty acknowledgment of the source,\r\ncopious extracts from Dr. Gowers’ article on ‘Trance’ in Quain’s\r\n‘Dictionary of Medicine.’\r\n\r\n“The possibility of apparent death being mistaken for real death can\r\nonly be admitted when the decision of the reality of death is left to\r\nignorant persons. We are quite unprepared to admit the possibility of\r\nsuch a mistake occurring in this country to a medical practitioner\r\narmed with the methods for the recognition of death that modern\r\nscience has placed at his disposal. Moreover, even by the ignorant the\r\nreality of death can only be questioned during the period preceding\r\nputrefaction. During this period various signs of death appear which,\r\ntaken collectively, allow of an absolute opinion as to the reality of\r\ndeath being given. To each of these, as a sign of death, exception may\r\nperhaps be individually taken, but a medical opinion is formed from a\r\nconjunction of these signs, and not from the presence of an individual\r\none.”\r\n\r\n[THE “BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL.”]\r\n\r\nThe writer must surely have overlooked the able treatises by Winslow,\r\nKempner, Russell Fletcher, Hartmann, Gannal, and others, supported by\r\nevidence in the aggregate of thousands of cases of premature burial\r\nor narrow escapes, or have forgotten the dreadful cases which have\r\nappeared from time to time in the columns of the _British Medical\r\nJournal_ itself. Commenting upon the case of a child nearly buried\r\nalive, this medical authority in its issue of October 31, 1885,\r\nunder the head of “Death or Coma,” sensibly refers to some of the\r\ndifficulties in distinguishing apparent from real death as follows:--\r\n\r\n“The close similarity which is occasionally seen to connect the\r\nappearance of death with that of exhaustion following disease, was\r\nlately illustrated in a somewhat striking manner. An infant, seized\r\nwith convulsions, was supposed to have died about three weeks ago at\r\nStamford Hill. After five days’ interval, preparations were being made\r\nfor its interment, when, at the grave’s mouth, a cry was heard to\r\ncome from the coffin. The lid was taken off, and the child was found\r\nto be alive, was taken home, and is recovering. Such is the published\r\naccount of the latest recorded case of suspended animation. We need\r\nnot now attempt a dissertation on the physical meaning of coma. It\r\nis well known that this condition may last for considerable periods,\r\nand may at times, _even to the practised eye_, wear very much the\r\nsame aspect as death. In the present instance, its association with\r\nsome degree of convulsion may easily have been mistaken by relatives,\r\ndreading the worst, for the rigid stillness of _rigor mortis_. This\r\nis the more likely, since the latter state is apt to be a transient\r\none in infants, though it is said to be unusually well marked in death\r\nfrom convulsions. One cannot, however, help thinking that the presence\r\nof the various signs of death was not, in this case, very carefully\r\ninquired into. It is hardly possible that, had the other proofs as well\r\nas that of stiffening been sought for, they would have been missed. _It\r\nis true that hardly any one sign short of putrefaction can be relied\r\nupon as infallible._ In actual death, however, one may confidently\r\nreckon on the co-existence of more than one of these. After a period of\r\nfive days, not one should have been wanting. Besides _rigor mortis_,\r\nthe total absence of which, even in forms of death which are said\r\nnot to show it, we take leave to doubt, the _post-mortem_ lividity of\r\ndependent parts afford sure proof, as its absence suggests a doubt,\r\nof death. Then there is the eye, sunken, with glairy surface, flaccid\r\ncornea, and dilated insensitive pupil. Most practitioners, probably,\r\nare accustomed to rely upon stethoscopic evidence of heart-action or\r\nrespiration. These alone, indeed, are almost always sufficient to\r\ndecide the question of vitality, if they be watched for during one or\r\ntwo minutes. There is no information as to whether the child so nearly\r\nburied alive was seen by a medical man. It is difficult to believe\r\nthat, if it had been, some sign of life would not have been observed.\r\nStill, the case is a teaching one, even for medical men, and warns us\r\nto look for a combination of known tests where any doubt exists as to\r\nthe fact of death.” The italics are ours.\r\n\r\nProf. Alex. Wilder, M.D., in “Perils of Premature Burial,” p. 20,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n[DR. ALEXANDER WILDER’S OPINION.]\r\n\r\n“The signs of total extinction of life are not so unequivocal as many\r\nsuppose. Cessation of respiration and circulation do not afford the\r\nentire evidence, for the external senses are not sufficiently acute to\r\nenable us to detect either respiration or circulation in the smallest\r\ndegree compatible with mere existence. Loss of heat is by no means\r\nconclusive; for life may continue, and recovery take place, when no\r\nperceptible vital warmth exists.”\r\n\r\nM. B. Gaubert, in “Les Chambres Mortuaires d’Attente,” p. 187, Paris,\r\n1895, says:--\r\n\r\n“One of the most celebrated physicians of the Paris hospitals,\r\naccording to Dr. Lignières, declares that out of twenty certified\r\ndeaths, one only presented indubitable characteristics of absolute\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of diagnosis in many cases being allowed renders\r\nthe obligation and necessity for a radical change in our methods\r\nof treating the supposed dead a very urgent one. Medical writers,\r\nwhilst admitting the unsatisfactory nature of the current practice of\r\nmedical certification, allege that the remedy lies with Parliament\r\nto make compulsory a personal medical inspection of the dead, and to\r\nallow a fee as compensation for the trouble. This, however, would be\r\nvery far from meeting the difficulty. How many general practitioners\r\nwould be willing to submit half-a-dozen, say, of the eleven tests of\r\ndeath formulated by Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson, in any given case,\r\nand if willing, how many, having regard to the fact that these tests\r\nare not taught in the Medical Schools, and form no part of the usual\r\nmedical curriculum, would be competent to make them with the requisite\r\nskill? In most of the Continental States there are State-appointed\r\nsurgeons to examine the dead, _médécins vérificateurs_, and in\r\nsome of these--Würtemburg, for instance--the official is obliged\r\nto examine the corpse several times before his certificate is made\r\nout. But notwithstanding this careful official inspection, cases of\r\npremature burial and narrow escapes are telegraphed by _Reuter_ and\r\n_Dalziel_ every now and then to the English Press, as we have seen, and\r\nadditional details, with the names and addresses of the victims, are\r\nfurnished by responsible special correspondents.\r\n\r\n[CONFUSION OF MEDICAL OPINIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe best proof that one can give of the uncertainty of the signs of\r\ndeath is the great divergence of opinion amongst medical experts. Dr.\r\nGannal, in “Signes de la Mort,” Paris, 1890, p. 27, observes:--“If\r\nany of these signs had presented characters of absolute certainty, it\r\nis unquestionable that the unanimity of authors would have recognised\r\nit; now, there is none. One sign held to be good by some, is declared\r\nbad by others.” Dr. Gannal affirms with iteration that there is only\r\none unequivocal sign and proof of dissolution--decomposition. All\r\nauthorities agree that whatever degree of doubt attends the ordinary\r\nappearances of death, none dispute that this amounts to a demonstration.\r\n\r\nWhen standing round the bed of a sick patient, reduced to a state\r\nof coma or suspended animation, to which death is the expected\r\ntermination, as soon as the doctor utters the fatal words “all is\r\nover,” no one present thinks of doubting the verdict, or putting it to\r\nthe test. Mr. Clarke Irvine, who has had a wide experience, writing in\r\nthe _Banner of Light_, December 14, 1895, Boston, U.S., says:--\r\n\r\n“I have known of hundreds of deaths in my experience, and never have\r\nI known of any instance wherein a bystander has doubted save once,\r\nand then the person supposed dead was revived, and is now living out\r\nin Colorado. The mere accident of a stranger coming in just previous\r\nto the enclosing in a coffin prevented the man from the awful fate of\r\nburial alive, so far as we can see.\r\n\r\n“In one other, the supposed dead man came to life a little before the\r\ntime set for his funeral, by the accident of some one seizing hold of\r\nhis foot: he is still living, and a resident of this country. The case\r\nwas widely published in the newspapers after he was interviewed by a\r\nreporter in Chicago, where the rescued man was visiting at the time of\r\nthe great Fair. He is known as Judge William Poynter. I saw him a few\r\ndays ago, and have heard him relate the experience.\r\n\r\n“The case of the little girl who was rescued while the funeral was\r\nin progress, at St. Joseph, Missouri, I have already contributed to\r\n_The Banner_. These people were saved by a mere chance; how many have\r\npassed underground forever, of whom nothing was ever suspected! All\r\nthrough the country, people are dying or apparently dying, or falling\r\ninto death-like trances daily, and being placed in their coffins _as a\r\nmatter of course_, and hurried to and into their graves, _as of course_\r\nalso--and in the very nature of things it must be and must have been\r\nthat hundreds upon hundreds have been and are being consigned to that\r\nmost awful of all the dooms possible. The horror of the thing is simply\r\nunspeakable.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL REGULATIONS FOR THE PREVENTION OF PREMATURE INTERMENT IN\r\nBAVARIA.\r\n\r\n[BAVARIAN REGULATIONS.]\r\n\r\nThe following are extracts from the Police Regulations for the\r\ninspection of the dead, and the prevention of premature burial in\r\nBavaria, and issued by the Royal State-Ministry for Home affairs:--\r\n\r\n\r\n § 4.\r\n\r\n In public hospitals, penitentiaries, charitable or other similar homes\r\n or institutions, the duty of inspection falls upon the physician in\r\n chief.\r\n\r\n Outside these institutions the inspectors must be chosen, in the\r\n first instance, from among physicians, after them surgeons, former\r\n assistants of military hospitals, and lastly, in default of such, from\r\n lay people. The latter must, however, be of undoubted respectability,\r\n and, before their appointment, must be properly instructed by the\r\n district physician, and subjected from time to time to an examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n § 6.\r\n\r\n As a rule the inspection of dead bodies must be made once if by\r\n doctors, and twice if by laymen. In communities which possess a\r\n mortuary a _second inspection_ has to be made, even though the regular\r\n inspection has previously been made by doctors or laymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n § 7.\r\n\r\n The first inspection has to be made as soon as possible after death,\r\n and, where practicable, within twenty-four hours, and in cases\r\n described under § 6, sec. 2, at least before removal of the body to\r\n the mortuary.\r\n\r\n The second inspection must take place just before burial.\r\n\r\n\r\n § 8.\r\n\r\n The body, until the arrival of the Inspector, must be left in\r\n an undisturbed position, with the face uncovered, and free from\r\n closely-fitting garments.\r\n\r\n The instructions of the Inspector, for the resuscitation of a body\r\n suspected of apparent death only, are to be followed most strictly.\r\n\r\n\r\n § 9.\r\n\r\n The Inspector has to give a certificate of corpse inspection\r\n confirmatory of his inspection, but he must only issue the same if he\r\n has fully ascertained the actuality of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n § 10.\r\n\r\n (1) As a rule the bodies must not be interred before the lapse of 48\r\n hours, but not later than 72 hours, after death.\r\n\r\n The Police Authorities may, however, at the recommendation of the\r\n Corpse Inspector, exceptionally grant permission for the burial before\r\n the expiration of 48 hours if a _post-mortem_ dissection has taken\r\n place, also if decomposition has set in, and if on account of lack of\r\n room the body has to be preserved in an overcrowded habitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n APPENDIX to the Police Instructions as to Corpse Inspection and time\r\n of Burial, of 20th November, 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\n I.\r\n\r\n The purpose of corpse inspection is to prohibit the concealment of\r\n deaths by violent means or resulting from medical malpractices;\r\n to detect infectious diseases, and the establishment of correct\r\n death lists; and particularly _to prevent the burial of people only\r\n apparently dead_. For this purpose each corpse is to be closely\r\n examined on the first inspection as to any signs of death, both in the\r\n front and the back of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n II.\r\n\r\n The Inspectors have primarily to establish the actuality of death by\r\n observing and notifying all the symptoms accompanying or following the\r\n decease.\r\n\r\n Indications of death may be noted:--\r\n\r\n (1) If there is no indication of any pulsation noticeable, either in\r\n the region of the heart, at the neck, at the temples, or the forearm.\r\n\r\n (2) If the eyelids when pulled asunder remain open, and the eyes\r\n themselves appear sunken into their sockets, dulled, and lustreless,\r\n also if the eyeballs feel soft and relaxed.\r\n\r\n (3) If parts of the body are pale and cold, if chin and nose are\r\n pointed, if cheeks and temples are sunken.\r\n\r\n (4) If the lower jaw hangs down and immediately drops again if pushed\r\n up, or if the muscles feel hard and stiff (rigidity).\r\n\r\n (5) If the skin of the fingers held against one another, held towards\r\n light, do not appear reddish.\r\n\r\n (6) If a feather or burning candle held against the mouth show no sign\r\n of motion, or if there is no sign of moisture upon a looking-glass\r\n held before the mouth.\r\n\r\n (7) If on different parts of the body, particularly the neck, back, or\r\n posterior, or the undersurface of the extremities there are bluish-red\r\n spots (death spots) visible.\r\n\r\n (8) If the skin, particularly at the sides of the stomach, show a\r\n dirty-green discoloration (decomposition spots).\r\n\r\n The non-Medical Inspector has to observe at least all the symptoms 1\r\n to 4.\r\n\r\n In doubtful cases the Medical Inspectors are advised to test the\r\n muscles and nerves by electric currents.\r\n\r\n\r\n IV.\r\n\r\n If the inspection gives rise to suspicions of apparent death\r\n (Scheintod), the inspector must (if he is not himself a doctor)\r\n immediately call for the assistance of a practised physician, so as to\r\n establish the actual condition, and to adopt the necessary measures\r\n for resuscitation, as follows:--\r\n\r\n (1) Opening of the windows, and warming the room.\r\n\r\n (2) Efforts at artificial respiration.\r\n\r\n (3) Applications of warm mustard-plaisters to the chest and the\r\n extremities.\r\n\r\n (4) Rubbing with soft brushes, with cloths saturated in vinegar, or\r\n spirit of camphor, also with hot woollen cloths.\r\n\r\n (5) Irritation of the throat with a feather.\r\n\r\n (6) Smelling sal-ammoniac.\r\n\r\n (7) Dropping from time to time a few drops of “extract of balm” or\r\n similar essences into the mouth.\r\n\r\n Unless medical aid has meanwhile arrived, the application of these\r\n measures must be continued until the apparently dead comes, back to\r\n life, and begins to swallow, in which case he ought to have warm\r\n broth, tea, or wine, or until there is absolutely no doubt as to the\r\n total ineffectiveness of all attempts at reanimation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nDURATION OF DEATH-COUNTERFEITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE differences observed in the length of time that persons have\r\nremained in this condition depended, doubtless, upon the constitutional\r\npeculiarities of the patients--such as strength or weakness--or upon\r\nthe nature of the disease from which they may have suffered. Struve,\r\nin his Essay, pp. 34-98, says “that it depends upon the proportion\r\nof vital power in the individual. Hence children and young persons\r\nwill endure longer than the aged. Also upon the nature of the element\r\nin which the accident happened, whether it contained greater or less\r\nproportion of oxygenated or carbonic acid gas, or other poisonous\r\nvapours. The latent vital power seems to be much longer preserved\r\nwhen animation has been suspended by cold. A man revived after being\r\nunder snow forty hours. Persons apparently dead sometimes awake after\r\nan interval of seven days, as was the case with Lady Russell.... In\r\nthe female sex, the suspension of vital power, spasms, fainting fits,\r\netc., originating from a hysterical, feeble constitution, are not\r\nrare, nor is it improbable that the state of apparent death may be of\r\nlonger duration with them; nay, it may be looked upon as a periodical\r\ndisorder, in which all susceptibility of irritation is extinguished.”\r\nStruve further remarks, p. 98, “that the state in which the vital\r\npower is suspended, or in which there is a want of susceptibility\r\nof stimuli, consists of infinite modifications, from the momentary\r\ntransient fainting fit, to a death-like torpor of a day’s duration.\r\nThe susceptibility of irritation may be completely suppressed, and the\r\napparently dead may be insensible of the strongest stimuli, such as the\r\noperation of the knife, and the effects of a red-hot iron.”\r\n\r\n[M. JOSAT’S OBSERVATIONS.]\r\n\r\nM. Josat, in “De la Mort et de ses Caractères,” gives the result of\r\nhis own observations in one hundred and sixty-two instances, in which\r\napparent death lasted--\r\n\r\n  In 7 from 36 to 42 hours.\r\n    20   ”  20 to 36   ”\r\n    47   ”  15 to 20   ”\r\n    58   ”   8 to 15   ”\r\n    30   ”   2 to  8   ”\r\n\r\nThe order of frequency of diseases in which these occurred was as\r\nfollows:--Asphyxia, hysteria, apoplexy, narcotism, concussion of the\r\nbrain, the cases of concussion being the shortest.\r\n\r\nThe length of time a person may live in the grave will depend upon\r\nsimilar concomitant conditions; but all things considered, a person\r\nburied while in a state of trance, catalepsy, asphyxia, narcotism,\r\nnervous shock, etc., and in any of the other states that cause apparent\r\ndeath without passing through a course of disease, and that occur\r\nduring his or her usual health, will have a longer struggle before\r\nlife becomes extinct than one whose strength had been exhausted by\r\nan attack of sickness. Estimates of the duration of such a struggle\r\ndiffer considerably. Some writers believe that “however intense, it\r\nmust be short-lived.” As to the prolongation of the horrible suffering\r\nincident to such tragic occurrences, Dr. Léonce Lénormand, in his\r\n“Des Inhumations Précipitées,” pp. 2-4, observes--“It is a mistake to\r\nthink that a living person, enclosed in a narrow box, and covered with\r\nseveral feet of earth, would succumb to immediate asphyxiation.”[16]\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Londe, in his “La Mort Apparent,” remarks:--“It has been\r\ncalculated that, after one quarter of the quantity of atmospheric air\r\ncontained in the coffin--approximately estimated at one hundred and\r\ntwenty litres--was exhausted, death would set in; therefore, it is\r\nquite certain that, if the shroud is thick, and the coffin well closed,\r\nand the grave impenetrable to the atmosphere, life could not last more\r\nthan forty to sixty minutes after inhumation. But is not that a century\r\nof torture?”\r\n\r\nSome allowance should be made for the persistence of the vital energy,\r\nwhich continues after all atmospheric air is cut off. “Experiments on\r\ndogs show that the average duration of the respiratory movements after\r\nthe animal has been deprived of air is four minutes five seconds. The\r\nduration of the heart’s action is seven minutes eleven seconds. The\r\naverage of the heart’s action after the animal has ceased to make\r\nrespiratory efforts is three minutes fifteen seconds. These experiments\r\nfurther showed that a dog may be deprived of air during three minutes\r\nfifty seconds, and afterwards recover without the application of\r\nartificial means.”[17]\r\n\r\n[PERSISTENCE OF LIFE.]\r\n\r\nProf. P. Brouardel, M.D., Paris, in “La Morte Subité,” p. 35, observes\r\nthat:--“A dog, placed in a common coffin, lived five to six hours;\r\nbut a dog occupies less room than a man, who, in such a coffin, when\r\nclosed, would not have more than one hundred litres, so he would\r\npossibly live twenty minutes. I would not wish anybody to pass twenty\r\nsuch cruel minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bernard, a skilful surgeon of Paris, certified that, in the parish\r\nof Riol, he himself, and several other bystanders, saw a monk of the\r\nOrder of St. Francis, who had been buried for three or four days, taken\r\nfrom his grave breathing and alive, with his arms lacerated near the\r\nswathes employed to secure them; but he died immediately after his\r\nreleasement. This gentleman also asserts that a faithful narrative of\r\nso memorable an accident was drawn up by public authority, and that\r\nthe raising of the body was occasioned by a letter written from one of\r\nthe monk’s friends, in which it was affirmed that he was subject to\r\nparoxysms of catalepsy.”--_The Uncertainty of the Signs of Death, by\r\nSurgeon M. Cooper. Dublin, 1748._\r\n\r\nIn a volume, entitled “Information Relative to Persons who have been\r\nBuried Alive,” by Heinrich Friedrich Köppen, Halle, 1799, dedicated to\r\nFrederick William III., King of Prussia, and Louise, Queen of Prussia,\r\nare the nine following amongst many other cases:--\r\n\r\n “_England._--Lady Russell, wife of a colonel in the army, was\r\n considered dead, and only through the tender affection of her husband\r\n was she saved from living burial. He would not allow her to be taken\r\n away until decomposition would absolutely force him to do so. After\r\n seven days, however, in the evening, when the bells were ringing, the\r\n faithful husband had the triumph to see her eyes open and her return\r\n to full consciousness.”\r\n\r\n “_Halle, Germany._--Medical Professor Junker, in Halle, a very humane\r\n man, had a corpse of a suicide--by hanging--delivered for dissection\r\n at his college. He was placed on a table in the dissecting room, and\r\n covered with a cloth. About midnight, while the professor was sitting\r\n at his writing-table in an adjoining room, he heard a great noise\r\n in the dissecting room, and fearing that cats were gnawing at the\r\n corpses, he went out, and saw the cloth in a disturbed condition,\r\n and on lifting it up found the corpse missing. As all the doors and\r\n windows were closed, he searched the room, and found the missing one\r\n crouching in a corner, trembling with cold, in the terror of death.\r\n He besought the professor for mercy, help, and means for escape, as\r\n he was a deserter from the army, and he would be severely punished\r\n if caught. After consideration the kind professor clothed him,\r\n and took him out of town at night as his own servant--passing the\r\n guards--pretending to be on a professional visit, and set him free\r\n in the country. Years afterwards he met the same man in Hamburg as a\r\n prosperous merchant.”\r\n\r\n “_Leipsic._--The wife of the publisher, Mathäus Hornisch, died, and,\r\n according to the custom of the times, the coffin was opened before\r\n being put into the ground. The grave-digger noticed golden rings on\r\n her fingers, and in the following night went to the grave to steal\r\n them--which he found was not easy to do--when suddenly she drew back\r\n her arm. The robber ran away frightened, leaving his lantern at the\r\n grave. The woman recovered, but could not make out where she was, and\r\n cried for help. No one heard her; so she got out of the grave, took\r\n the lantern, and went to her home. Knocking at the door, the servant\r\n called to know who it was. She replied, “Your mistress. Open the door;\r\n I am cold, and freezing to death.” The master was called; and happily\r\n she was restored to her home again, where she lived for several years\r\n longer.”\r\n\r\n “_Pavese, Italy, 1787._--A clergyman was buried, and noises were heard\r\n in his grave afterwards. Upon opening the grave and the coffin, the\r\n man was found alive, and violently trembling with fright.”\r\n\r\n “_Paris, 1787._--A carpenter was buried, noises were heard proceeding\r\n from his grave, and upon opening it he was found to be breathing. He\r\n was taken to his home, where he recovered.”\r\n\r\n [DR. KÖPPEN’S CASES.]\r\n\r\n “_Stadamhof, 1785._--A young, healthy girl, on the way to a wedding,\r\n had an apoplectic stroke, as it was thought, and fell as if dead. The\r\n following day she was buried. The grave-digger, who was occupied near\r\n her grave that night, heard noises in it, and being superstitious ran\r\n home in fright. The following morning he returned to finish a grave\r\n he was digging, and heard the whining again from the girl’s grave.\r\n He called for help, the grave was opened, when they found the girl\r\n turned over, her face scratched and bloody, her fingers bitten, and\r\n her mouth full of blood. She was dead, with evidences of most dreadful\r\n suffering.”\r\n\r\n “_France._--Madame Lacour died after a long sickness, and was buried\r\n in a vault of a church, with all her jewels on. Her maid and the\r\n sexton opened the coffin the following night to steal the jewellery,\r\n when some hot wax from the candle they were using fell on the\r\n woman’s face and woke her up. The robbers fled in fright, and the\r\n woman went back to her home. She lived many years afterwards, and\r\n had a son who became a priest, who in turn--inheriting his mother’s\r\n nature--underwent a fate similar to her own.”\r\n\r\n “_Lyons, France._--The wife of a merchant died. Two days after her\r\n seeming death, and just before the time set for her burial, her\r\n husband, who, it seems, had some doubts as to her death, had her\r\n taken from the coffin, and had a scarifier used in cupping applied in\r\n twenty-five places without bringing any blood, but the twenty-sixth\r\n application brought her to consciousness with a scream, and she\r\n recovered completely.”\r\n\r\n “_Cadillac._--A woman had been buried in the morning. In the following\r\n morning whining was heard in her grave. It was opened, and the woman\r\n was found still alive, but she had mutilated half of her right arm and\r\n the whole hand. She was finally restored.”\r\n\r\nThe _Spectator_, October 11, 1895, publishes particulars of a recent\r\ncase of recovery, after three days’ interment, in Ireland. See pp. 111,\r\n112 in this volume.\r\n\r\nKöppen’s investigations led him to observe that--“Human life may\r\nappear to come to a stop, and no one can say it will not go on again,\r\nif time enough is allowed for it to do so. This even the most learned\r\nin medicine cannot explain away or deny; and the greatest precaution\r\nshould be taken before death is declared to exist.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE following extracts from French, English, and American authorities,\r\nwho have made the subject of premature burial one of patient research,\r\nshow how the dead, or apparently dead, were treated in their respective\r\ncountries at the time they wrote, and when no reforms had been\r\ninstituted. Buffon, who wrote more than a century ago, said:--“Life\r\noften very nearly resembles death. Neither ten, nor twenty, nor\r\ntwenty-four hours are sufficient to distinguish real from apparent\r\ndeath. There are instances of persons who have been alive in the grave\r\nat the end of the second, and even the third day. Why, then, suffer to\r\nbe interred so soon those whose lives we ardently wished to prolong?\r\nMost savages pay more attention to deceased friends and relatives,\r\nand regard as the first duty what is but a ceremony with us. Savages\r\nrespect their dead, clothe them, speak to them, recite their exploits,\r\nextol their virtues; while we, who pique ourselves on our feelings, do\r\nnot show common humanity; we forsake and fly from our dead. We have\r\nneither courage to look upon or speak to them; we avoid every place\r\nwhich can recall their memory.”\r\n\r\nIn his “History of the Modes of Interment among Different Nations,” pp.\r\n191-193, Mr. G. A. Walker, surgeon, quotes the following observations,\r\nas deserving consideration on the subject of premature interment:--“On\r\nmany occasions, in all places, too much precipitation attends this\r\nlast office; or, if not precipitation, a neglect of due precautions\r\nin regard to the body in general; indeed, the most improper treatment\r\nthat can be imagined is adopted, and many a person is made to descend\r\ninto the grave before he has sighed his last breath. Ancient and\r\nmodern authors leave us no doubt respecting the dangers or misconduct\r\nof such precipitation. It must appear astonishing that the attention\r\nof mankind has been, after all, so little aroused by an idea the most\r\nterrible that can be conceived on this side eternity. According to\r\npresent usage, as soon as the semblance of death appears, the chamber\r\nof the sick is deserted by friends, relatives, and physicians; and the\r\napparently dead, though frequently living, body is committed to the\r\nmanagement of an ignorant and unfeeling nurse, whose care extends no\r\nfurther than laying the limbs straight, and securing her accustomed\r\nperquisites. The bed-clothes are immediately removed, and the body is\r\nexposed to the air. This, when cold, must extinguish any spark of life\r\nthat may remain, and which, by a different treatment, might have been\r\nkindled into flame; or it may only continue to repress it, and the\r\nunhappy person afterwards revive amidst the horrors of the tomb.\r\n\r\n“The difference between the end of a weak life and the commencement of\r\ndeath is so small, and the uncertainty of the signs of the latter is\r\nso well established, that we can scarcely suppose undertakers capable\r\nof distinguishing an apparent from a real death. Animals which sleep\r\nin the winter show no signs of life. In this case, circulation is\r\nonly suspended; but were it annihilated, the vital spark does not so\r\neasily lose its action as the fluids of the body, and the principle\r\nof life, which long survives the appearance of death, may re-animate\r\na body in which the action of all the organs seems to be at an end.\r\nBut how difficult it is to determine whether this principle may not\r\nbe revived.... Coldness, heaviness of the body, a leaden, livid\r\ncolour, with a yellowness in the visage, are all very uncertain signs.\r\nM. Zimmermann observed them all upon the body of a criminal, who\r\nfainted through dread of that punishment which he had merited. He was\r\nshaken, dragged about, and turned in the same manner as dead bodies\r\nare, without the least signs of resistance, and yet, at the end of\r\ntwenty-four hours, he was recalled to life by means of the volatile\r\nalkali.” Mr. Walker’s history was written nearly sixty years ago, but\r\nthe custom he deprecates still continues.\r\n\r\n[IN THE UNITED STATES.]\r\n\r\nDr. Moore Russell Fletcher, in his “Suspended Animation and\r\nRestoration,” Boston, 1890, p. 19, speaking of the treatment of the\r\ndead in the United States, says:--“It is doubtful whether modern\r\ncivilisation has much advanced the rites of burial, or the means of\r\npreventing interment before positive death. The practice now is, as\r\nsoon as apparent death takes place, to begin at once preparing the body\r\nfor burial; the relatives and physician desert the room, pack it in ice\r\nor open the windows, thus banishing any possible chance of reviving or\r\nresuscitating any spark of vitality which may exist. No examination\r\nis ever made by the physician or the friends to see if there are even\r\nthe faintest signs of life present. Under such circumstances, and with\r\nno attempts made at discovering whether any signs of life were still\r\npresent (but a hasty burial instead), it is not strange that cases of\r\npremature interment frequently occur.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Walter Whiter, in his “Dissertation on the Disorder of\r\nDeath,” 1819, p. 328, sensibly observes:--“The signs marked on the\r\ndying and the dead are fallacious. The dying man may be the sinking\r\nman, exhausted by his malady, or perhaps exhausting his malady, and\r\nfainting under the conflict. Exert all the arts which you possess,\r\nand which have been found not only able to resuscitate and restore\r\nthe dying, but even the dead; rouse him from this perilous condition,\r\nand suffer him not, by your supineness and neglect, to pass into a\r\nstate of putrefactive death.” And in p. 363:--“If the humane societies\r\nhad applied the same methods in various cases of natural death which\r\nthey have adopted in the case of drowning, and if they had obtained a\r\nsimilar success in the cultivation of their art, the gloom of the bed\r\nof death would be brightened with cheering prospects, and would have\r\nbecome the bed of restoration and the scene of hope.”\r\n\r\n[AN OPENING FOR THE PROFESSION.]\r\n\r\nIn this connection we may remark that no profession is more overcrowded\r\nat the present time than that of medicine, particularly in the United\r\nKingdom, the English Colonies, and the United States. Hundreds of young\r\nmen graduate from medical colleges every year, vainly seeking openings\r\nfor a practice; and some, for the purpose of gaining a livelihood,\r\nresort to expedients which the _Lancet_ denounces as undignified,\r\nunprofessional, and disgraceful.[18] Then, again, the number of nurses\r\nand of those qualifying for this honourable vocation is already\r\nin excess of the demand, and nursing institutions under the keen\r\ncompetition to which they are subjected, are reducing their charges.\r\nNow, the care and treatment of the supposed dead is an honourable\r\nvocation, offering a wide field for the instructed physician and the\r\ntender and sympathetic nurse, and if the appliances for resuscitation\r\nwere always at hand, as they should be, in every hospital, town-hall,\r\nmortuary, police station, and in all large hotels and churches, many\r\nlives now subjected to the risks of premature burial would be saved.\r\nWhile in London there are two or more houses or retreats for the dying,\r\nthere is no place for the apparently dead but a shunned and neglected\r\ncoffin. The time is not far distant when the present mode of treating\r\nthe dead and the apparently dead--a practice born of superstition\r\nand fear, by which many are consigned to premature graves--will be\r\ncatalogued amongst the barbarisms of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF CASES OF PREMATURE BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOSE interested in the movement, if we are right in designating the\r\nwidespread feeling of discontent by this name, are occasionally asked\r\nif the cases of premature burial are numerous, and what estimates,\r\nif any, have been made of them. We have no means of answering these\r\nqueries. We do not even know the percentage of people who are subject\r\nto trance, catalepsy, shocks, stroke of lightning, syncope, exhausting\r\nlethargy, excessive opium-eating, or other diseases or conditions\r\nwhich produce the various death-counterfeits. Personal inquiries over\r\na considerable portion of Europe, America, and the East prove that\r\nsuch cases are by no means of infrequent occurrence, and this is the\r\ndeliberate conclusion of nearly all the authorities cited in this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nDr. Chambers wrote in 1787--“Every age and country affords instances\r\nof surprising recoveries, after lying long for dead. From the number\r\nof those preserved by lucky accidents, we may conclude a far greater\r\nnumber might have been preserved by timely pains and skill.”--_Cited in\r\nMort Apparente et Mort Réelle, p. 17._\r\n\r\nIn his introduction to the work above cited, “Information Relative\r\nto Persons who have been Buried Alive,” by Henrich Friedrich Köppen,\r\nHalle, 1799, the author says:--“General Staff Medical Officer, D. O.\r\nin D., states that, in his opinion, one third of mankind are buried\r\nalive.” This estimate is very obviously exaggerated, although many\r\ntrustworthy experiences prove that a certain number of those who die\r\nhave returned to consciousness in their graves. A great many are buried\r\nalive from ignorance of their relatives, who mistake coldness of the\r\nbody, stoppage of the pulse and breathing, the colour of death, spots\r\nof discolouration, a certain odour, and stiffness of the limbs--which\r\nare only deceptive signs, not the signs of real death.\r\n\r\n[DR. HUFELAND’S ADVICE.]\r\n\r\nThe very respectable Dr. Hufeland says:--“One cannot be too careful in\r\ndeciding as to life or death, therefore I always advise a delay of the\r\nfuneral as long as possible, so as to make all certain as to death. No\r\nwonder when those who are buried alive, and who undergo indescribable\r\ntorture, condemn those who have been dearest to them in life. They will\r\nhave to undergo slow suffocation, in furious despair, while scratching\r\ntheir flesh to pieces, biting their tongues, and smashing their heads\r\nagainst their narrow houses that confine them, and calling to their\r\nbest friends, and cursing them as murderers. The dead should not be\r\nburied before the fourth day; we even have examples that prove that\r\neight days or a fortnight is too soon--as there have been revivals as\r\nlate as that. I say every one should respect those who only seem to\r\nbe dead. They should be treated gently, and kept in a warm bed for\r\nthirty-six hours.”\r\n\r\nMr. John Snart, in his “Thesaurus,” pp. 27, 28, London, 1817,\r\nsays:--“The number of dreadful catastrophes, arising from premature\r\ninterment, ... that have been _discovered_ only, or have transpired\r\nto man, _above ground_, both in ancient and modern times, conveys to\r\nevery reflecting mind the fearful thought that they are but a _sample_\r\n(per synecdochen) out of such an incalculable host, perhaps one in a\r\nthousand.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Froriép, quoted in Kempner’s volume, says that--“In 1829,\r\narrangements were made at the cemetery, New York, so as to bury the\r\ncorpses in such manner as not to prevent them communicating with the\r\noutside world, in case any should have awakened to life; and among\r\ntwelve hundred persons buried six came to life again.” In Holland, the\r\nsame author states, of a thousand cases investigated, five came to life\r\nbefore burial or at the grave. The Rev. J. G. Ouseley, in his pamphlet\r\non “Earth to Earth Burial,” London, 1895, estimates “that two thousand\r\nseven hundred persons at least, in England and Wales, are yearly\r\nconsigned to a living death, the most horrible conceivable.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Walter Whiter, in the “Disorder of Death,” 1819, p. 362,\r\ncalls attention to one of the reports (of Humane Societies) where the\r\nfollowing passage occurs: “Monsieur Thieurey, Doctor Regent of the\r\nFaculty of Paris, is of opinion that one third, or perhaps half, of\r\nthose who die in their beds are not actually dead when they are buried.\r\nHe does not mean to say that so great a number would be restored to\r\nlife. In the intermediate state, which reaches from the instant of\r\napparent death to that of total extinction of life, the body is not\r\ninsensible to the treatment it receives, though unable to give any\r\nsigns of sensibility.”\r\n\r\nMaximilian Misson, in his “Voyage Through Italy,” vol. i., letter 5,\r\ntells us “that the number of persons who have been interred as dead,\r\nwhen they were really alive, is very great, in comparison with those\r\nwho have been, happily, rescued from their graves.” He then proceeds\r\nto substantiate his statement by the recital of cases.\r\n\r\n[VARIOUS ESTIMATES.]\r\n\r\nDr. Léonce Lénormand, in his able treatise, “Des Inhumations\r\nPrécipitées,” has given his deliberate opinion that a thousandth part\r\nof the human race have been, and are, for want of knowledge, annually\r\nburied alive. This we regard as an under, rather than an overestimate.\r\n\r\nM. Le Guern, in his “Danger des Inhumations Précipitées,” which has\r\npassed through several editions, declares that he has personally met\r\nwith forty-six cases of premature burial in twelve years. He devoted\r\nthirty years to the study of the facts, and collected a list of two\r\nthousand three hundred and thirteen cases from various sources. He\r\nestimates the number of premature burials in France at two per thousand.\r\n\r\nOn February 27, 1866, the petition of M. Cornot was presented to the\r\nFrench Senate by M. de la Gueronnière, stating that a comparatively\r\nlarge number of persons are annually buried alive, which he supported\r\nby statistics. The author has tried to procure a copy of this petition,\r\nbut these documents are not published by the State department.\r\n\r\nThe following appears in the _Lancet_, June 14, 1884, p. 1104:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “BURIED ALIVE.\r\n\r\n “Sir,--That this is an incident that does happen, and frequently\r\n has happened, has for some years past been my firm conviction; and\r\n during epidemics, particularly in the East, its possible contingency\r\n has frequently caused me much anxiety; and when the burial has, for\r\n sanitary reasons, had to be very hurried, I always made it a rule to\r\n withhold my certificate unless I had personally inspected the body and\r\n assured myself of the fact of death.\r\n\r\n “The reason and necessity for extreme caution in such matters were\r\n impressed vividly upon me some years ago, when visiting the crypt\r\n of the cathedral at Bordeaux, where two bodies were shown, to whom,\r\n I think it obvious, this most terrible of all occurrences must have\r\n happened; and I am unable to attribute the position in which they were\r\n found in their coffins, and the look of horror which their faces still\r\n displayed, to any action of _rigor mortis_ or any other _post-mortem_\r\n change, but simply and solely to their having awakened to a full\r\n appreciation of their most awful position. In the case of one of\r\n these bodies, which was found lying on its side, the legs were drawn\r\n up nearly to a level with the abdomen, and the arms were in such a\r\n position as to convey the impression that both they and the legs had\r\n been used in a desperate, but futile, attempt to push out the side of\r\n the coffin; whilst the look of horror remaining on the face was simply\r\n indescribable. In the other case, the body was found lying on its\r\n face, the arms extended above the head, as if attempting to push out\r\n the top of the coffin. In the year 1870 these two bodies were still on\r\n view; and the attendants used to dwell at some length upon the horrors\r\n of being interred alive. It appears that some years prior to 1870,\r\n in making excavations in a church-yard in the immediate vicinity of\r\n the cathedral, the workmen came upon a belt of ground that apparently\r\n was impregnated with some antiseptic material, as all the bodies\r\n within this belt, to the number of about two hundred, were found to\r\n be almost as perfect as when they were buried; of these a selection\r\n appears to have been made; and at the time I mention about thirty or\r\n forty were exhibited, propped up on iron frames, in the crypt of the\r\n cathedral. The impression left on my mind at the time was that; if out\r\n of two hundred bodies so discovered there could be two in which, to\r\n say the least, there is a strong probability of live interment, this\r\n awful possibility was a thing that should receive more attention than\r\n is generally devoted to it.--I am, Sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  “H. S.\r\n\r\n “Bayswater, June 10, 1884.”\r\n\r\n[PROTESTS OF GENERAL COUNCILS.]\r\n\r\nProtests against the present state of the law in France are very\r\nfrequent. M. Gaubert in “Les Chambres Mortuaires d’Attente,” page 80,\r\nsays: “During the monarchy of July petitions have not ceased to come\r\nin from all parts of France to the Chamber of Deputies.” For a great\r\nnumber of years, said the Deputy Varin, in the sitting of April 10,\r\n1847, every year petitions having the same object (the prevention\r\nof premature burial) are presented to the Chambers and referred to\r\nthe Ministry. What has been done, however? Nothing! Again M. Gaubert\r\nin p. 88, referring to resolutions of the General Councils of the\r\nDepartments, observes: “That under the movement of protest, which we\r\nare examining and find particularly serious, is shown the widespread\r\ncharacter which it assumes. It is, indeed, from all parts of France,\r\nand under every form, that the sad complaints of the public (for the\r\nprevention of premature burial) arrive at the office of the Minister\r\nof the Interior. Those protests adopted by the General Councils (of\r\nDepartments) were not the less numerous nor the less conspicuous in\r\nimportant places. Many of those who take the trouble to petition\r\nor draw up resolutions have been prompted to action by melancholy\r\nexperience of such catastrophes in their own families.”\r\n\r\nM. Gaubert in “Les Chambres Mortuaires d’Attente” (Paris, 1895), pp.\r\n193-195, says that in France there are in round numbers thirty-six\r\nthousand Communes, and it is beyond doubt that in every one of these\r\nwill be found cases of premature burial. Communes with a population\r\nof eight hundred have even several. Dr. Pineau has recorded twelve in\r\nthe single Commune of Fontenay-le-Comte in Poitou. In the large towns,\r\nespecially in those which have great hospitals, the proportion is\r\nmore considerable. In Paris, Dr. Rousseau, verificateur of the dead,\r\nin 1853 wrote: “Le médecin n’est jamais appelé que pour constater la\r\nmort apparente.” M. Gaubert declares that he would not be far from the\r\ntruth in estimating the number of victims to apparent death at eight\r\nthousand a year, and asks if France be so rich in population as to be\r\nable to pay such an enormous tribute. Dr. Josat, lauréat de l’Institut,\r\ndeclares that a considerable number of people refuse to visit France\r\nthrough fear that they might be overtaken by apparent death and\r\nprecipitately buried alive.\r\n\r\nThe _Undertakers’ Journal_, July 22, 1889, the editor of which has\r\nexceptional opportunities of knowing the true facts, observes: “It\r\nhas been proved beyond all contradiction that there are more burials\r\nalive than is generally supposed. Stories of these cases are numerous.\r\nFive cases are reported on p. 85 of this same issue, one the wife of a\r\nwell-known tradesman at St. Leonards, medically pronounced dead, but\r\nwho revived before it was too late. Many undertakers could describe\r\nsimilar experiences.”\r\n\r\n[OPINIONS OF DRS. CHEW AND HARTMANN.]\r\n\r\nDr. Roger S. Chew, of Calcutta, in reply to the author’s inquiries\r\nwhile in India in the early part of the year (1896) says: “There are\r\nhundreds of instances on record where from some cause, as syncope,\r\nshock, chloroform, hysteria, or other condition not clearly understood,\r\nthe powers of life assumed a static condition in which oxidation\r\nwas completely arrested, carbonification was held in abeyance, and\r\nnitrification maintained at positive rest, with the consequence that\r\nthe vital functions have passed into a condition of hibernation or\r\napparent death so closely simulating real or absolute death as to\r\nrender differential diagnosis an almost impossibility, and to lead to\r\nthe interment or cremation while yet alive of a body apparently dead.”\r\n\r\nDr. Franz Hartmann, of Hallein, Austria, whose book, “Buried Alive,”\r\nis now being translated into French, has collected seven hundred cases\r\nof premature burial and narrow escapes, several of which have occurred\r\nin his own neighbourhood, and is of opinion that the actual danger to\r\nevery member of the human family is of serious proportions, and that\r\nthe subject should not be trifled with. He is a strong advocate for\r\ncremation as offering the easiest practical method of prevention.\r\n\r\nIt will have been noticed that whenever the subject of premature burial\r\nhas been introduced in an influential journal published in England,\r\nthe United States, or the Continent, one contribution follows another\r\nin quick succession, by persons furnishing particulars of cases of\r\ntrance, catalepsy, and of narrow escapes from living burial. The Paris\r\n_Figaro_ opened its columns two years ago for this subject, and in\r\nfifteen days received four hundred letters from all parts of France.\r\nWhen we consider that nearly all the reported cases of resuscitation\r\nhave come about spontaneously and independently of human intervention,\r\nit becomes evident, owing to our ignorance and apathy, that cases of\r\npremature burial are far from infrequent, and our church-yards and\r\ncemeteries, like those examined by Dr. Thouret in Paris, are probably\r\nthe silent witnesses of unnumbered unspeakable tragedies. Immediate\r\nlegislation is called for to remedy a national evil, and to remove the\r\nfeeling of disquietude which extensively prevails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nEMBALMING AND DISSECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN intelligent and observing correspondent writes to the author that\r\n“under the prevailing custom of embalming in vogue in the United\r\nStates, it is almost impossible to have a living burial, as the\r\ninjection of the fluids used in the operation would prevent revival\r\nand make death certain. Of course, the class denominated ‘poor folks,’\r\nwho cannot afford this security, have to take their chances with the\r\nmysteries of trance and other forms of apparent death, as well as with\r\nignorance, indifference, and unseemly haste, that seem to encompass a\r\nman at a time when he is in need of the most considerate care.”\r\n\r\nEmbalming is no doubt preferable, as was thought by the late Lady\r\nBurton, to the risks, prevailing in almost all countries, of burial\r\nbefore careful medical examination, for the reason that it is better\r\nto be killed outright by the embalmer’s poisonous injections, or even\r\nto come to life under the scalpel of the anatomist, than to recover\r\nunderground. A leading New York investigator has openly declared his\r\nbelief that a considerable number of human beings (supposed by their\r\nrelatives to be dead, but who are really only in a state of death\r\ntrance) are annually killed in America by the embalming process.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBALMING.\r\n\r\nIn the second edition of Dr. Curry’s “Observations on Apparent Death,”\r\n1815, p. 105, the case is cited of William, Earl of Pembroke, who died\r\nApril 10, 1630. When the body was opened in order to be embalmed, he\r\nwas observed, immediately after the incision was made, to lift up his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nF. Kempner, in “Denkschrift,” p. 6, says:--\r\n\r\n “Owing to some great mental excitement, the Cardinal Spinosa fell\r\n into a state of apparent death. He was declared to be dead by his\r\n physicians, and they proceeded to open his chest for the purpose of\r\n embalming his body. When the lungs were laid open, the heart began\r\n to beat again; the cardinal returned to consciousness, and was just\r\n able to grasp the knife of the surgeon when he fell back and died in\r\n reality.”[19]\r\n\r\n[PREMATURE EMBALMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe _Journal de Rouen_, Aug. 5th, 1837, relates the following:--\r\n\r\n “Cardinal Somaglia was seized with a severe illness, from extreme\r\n grief; he fell into a state of syncope, which lasted so long that the\r\n persons around him thought him dead. Preparations were instantly made\r\n to embalm his body, before the putrefactive process should commence,\r\n in order that he might be placed in a leaden coffin, in the family\r\n vault. The operator had scarcely penetrated into his chest when the\r\n heart was seen to beat. The unfortunate patient, who was returning to\r\n his senses at that moment, had still sufficient strength to push away\r\n the knife of the surgeon, but too late, for the lung had been mortally\r\n wounded, and the patient died in a most lamentable manner.”\r\n\r\nDr. Hartmann in “Premature Burial,” p. 80, says:--\r\n\r\n “The celebrated actress Mlle. Rachel died at Paris, on 4th January,\r\n 1858. After the process of embalming her body had already begun, she\r\n awoke from her trance, but died ten hours afterwards owing to the\r\n injuries that had been inflicted upon her.”\r\n\r\nThe _Celestial City_, New York, June 15, 1889, records:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “MRS. BISHOP’S EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\n “Mrs. Eleanor Fletcher Bishop, the mother of the celebrated\r\n mind-reader, has a thrilling experience of her own regarding the\r\n horrors of being railroaded into the grave. Anent the unseemly haste\r\n exercised by the doctors who made the autopsy on her son, the old lady\r\n stated what terrible perils she at one time barely escaped. ‘I am\r\n subject to the same cataleptic trances in which my boy often fell,’\r\n said Mrs. Bishop. ‘One can see and hear everything, but speech and\r\n movement are paralyzed. It is horrible. For six days, some years ago,\r\n I was in a trance, and saw arrangements being made for my funeral.\r\n Only my brother’s determined resistance prevented them from embalming\r\n me, and I lay there and heard it all. On the seventh day I came to\r\n myself, but the agony I endured left its mark forever.’”\r\n\r\nDr. P. J. Gibbons, M.A., says:--\r\n\r\n“In my mind there is no doubt that bodies in which life is not extinct\r\nare embalmed. To prevent the embalming of live bodies in cases where\r\ndoubt exists, my method for resuscitation should be resorted to. If\r\nsuccess does not follow, death has taken place. When one in whom the\r\nvital spark may possibly not yet have fled is found, two objects should\r\nbe aimed at, viz., first, to restore breathing, and, second, to promote\r\nwarmth and circulation.”--_The Casket_, Rochester, New York, April 1,\r\n1895.\r\n\r\nThe Select Committee of the House of Commons appointed in 1893 to\r\nenquire into the subject of Death Certification, suggests in their\r\nreport that in all cases where it is desired to embalm a dead body\r\nan authorisation should be obtained from the Home Secretary. This is\r\nprobably intended to prevent concealing cases of death by poisoning.\r\nThe Select Committee might very well have extended its recommendations\r\nto the need of verifying the death before the embalmer was allowed to\r\nexercise his art on the subject. Legislation in the United States,\r\nwhere embalming is extensively practised among well-to-do people, is a\r\nmatter of urgent necessity. The author is aware of only one town where\r\nthe city ordinance enforces such verification before permitting burial.\r\n\r\nMr. M. Cooper, surgeon, in his admirable little volume “The Uncertainty\r\nof the Signs of Death,” London, 1746, p. 196, observes that “those who\r\nare dissected run no risk of being interred alive. The operation is an\r\ninfallible means to secure them from so terrible a fate. This is one\r\nadvantage which persons dissected have over those who are, without any\r\nfurther ceremony, shut up in their coffins.”\r\n\r\n[PREMATURE AUTOPSIES.]\r\n\r\nThe following from Ogston’s _Medical Jurisprudence_, p. 370, is a\r\ncase in point (quoted by the _Lancet_):--“In October, 1840, a servant\r\ngirl, who had retired to bed apparently in perfect health, was found\r\nthe following morning, as it appeared, dead. A surgeon who was called\r\npronounced her to have been dead for some hours. A coroner’s inquest\r\nwas summoned for four o’clock, and the reporter and the surgeon who\r\nhad been called in to the girl were ordered to inspect the body\r\nprevious to its sitting. On proceeding to the house for this purpose\r\nat two o’clock, the inspectors found the girl lying in bed in an easy\r\nposture, her face pallid, but placid and composed, as if she were in\r\na deep sleep, while the heat of the body had not diminished. A vein\r\nwas opened by them, and various stimuli applied, but without affording\r\nany sign of resuscitation. After two hours of hesitation and delay, a\r\nmessage being brought that the jury were waiting for their evidence,\r\nthey were forced to proceed to the inspection. In moving the body for\r\nthis purpose, the warmth and pliancy of the limbs were such as to give\r\nthe examiners the idea that they had to deal with a living subject! The\r\ninternal cavities, as they proceeded, were found so warm that a very\r\ncopious steam issued from them on exposure. All the viscera were in a\r\nhealthy state, and nothing was detected which could throw the smallest\r\nlight on the cause of this person’s death.” Tidy (_Legal Medicine_),\r\npart i., p. 140, remarks thereon--“A mistake had no doubt been made in\r\nthis case, as its warmth was not caused by decomposition.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine_, edited by Sir John\r\nForbes, M.D., and others, 1847, vol. i., pp. 548-9, we find the\r\nfollowing:--“Nothing is more certain than death; nothing is more\r\nuncertain at times than its reality; and numerous instances are\r\nrecorded of persons prematurely buried, or actually at the verge of the\r\ngrave before it was discovered that life still remained; and even of\r\nsome who were resuscitated by the knife of the anatomist.... Bruhier,\r\na celebrated French physician, who wrote on the uncertainties of the\r\nsigns of death in 1742, relates an instance of a young woman upon whose\r\nsupposed corpse an anatomical examination was about to be made when\r\nthe first stroke of the scalpel revealed the truth; she recovered,\r\nand lived many years afterwards. The case related by Philippe Pue is\r\nsomewhat similar. He proceeded to perform the Cæsarean section upon\r\na woman who had to all appearance died undelivered, when the first\r\nincision betrayed the awful fallacy under which he acted.... ‘There\r\nis scarcely a dissecting-room that has not some traditional story\r\nhanded down of subjects restored to life after being deposited within\r\nits walls. Many of these are mere inventions to catch the ever greedy\r\near of curiosity; but some of them are, we fear, too well founded to\r\nadmit of much doubt. To this class belongs the circumstance related\r\nby Louis, the celebrated French writer on medical jurisprudence. A\r\npatient who was supposed to have died in the Hospital Salpétrière was\r\nremoved to his dissecting-room. Next morning Louis was informed that\r\nmoans had been heard in the theatre; and on proceeding thither he\r\nfound to his horror that the supposed corpse had revived during the\r\nnight, and had actually died in the struggle to disengage himself from\r\nthe winding sheet in which he was enveloped. This was evident from\r\nthe distorted attitude in which the body was found. Allowing for much\r\nof the fiction with which such a subject must ever be mixed, there\r\nis still sufficient evidence to warrant a diligent examination of\r\nthe means of discriminating between real and apparent death; indeed,\r\nthe horror with which we contemplate a mistake of the living for the\r\ndead should excite us to the pursuit of knowledge by which an event\r\nso repugnant to our feelings may be avoided.... If life depends upon\r\nthe presence of a force or power continually opposed to the action of\r\nphysical and chemical laws, real death will be the loss of this force,\r\nand the abandonment of organised bodies to these agents; while apparent\r\ndeath will be only the suspension of the exercise of life, caused by\r\nsome derangement of the functions which serve as instruments of vital\r\naction. This suspension must have been lost for a considerable time,\r\nif we may judge by the cases collected by credible authors, to some of\r\nwhich we have alluded, and by the numerous instances of drowned persons\r\nrestored to life after long submersion. From this definition of life\r\nand death, it would follow that putrefaction is the only evidence of\r\nreal death.’ ... The absence of the circulation of the blood has been\r\nlooked upon as a certain indication of death; but this test is not much\r\nto be depended on, for it is well known that persons may live even for\r\nhours in whom no trace of the action of the heart and arteries can be\r\nperceived.”\r\n\r\nLe Guern, in “Du Danger Des Inhumations Précipitées,” chap. iv., p. 24,\r\nrelates that “The Abbé Prévost was found in the forest of Chantilly\r\nperfectly insensible. They thought him dead. A surgeon proceeded\r\nto make a _post-mortem_; but hardly had he put the scalpel in the\r\nbody of the unfortunate victim before the supposed corpse uttered a\r\ncry, and the surgeon realised the mistake he had made. Prévost only\r\nbecame conscious to feel aware of the horror of the death by which he\r\nperished.”\r\n\r\nDr. Franz Hartmann, in his “Premature Burial,” p. 80, has the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n “In May, 1864, a man died very suddenly at a hospital in the State of\r\n New York, and, as the doctors could not explain the cause of death,\r\n they resolved upon a _post-mortem_ examination, but, when they made\r\n the first cut with the knife, the supposed dead man jumped up and\r\n grasped the doctor’s throat. The doctor was terrified and died of\r\n apoplexy on the spot, but the “dead” man recovered fully.\r\n\r\nBrigade-Surgeon W. Curran in his 8th paper, entitled “Buried Alive,”\r\nrelates the following:--“At the Medical College at Calcutta, on the 1st\r\nof February, 1861,” so writes my friend as above, “the body of a Hindu\r\nmale, about 25 years of age, was brought from the police hospital for\r\ndissection.... It was brought to the dissecting-room about 6 a.m., and\r\nthe arteries were injected with arsenical solution about 7. At 11 the\r\nprosector opened the thorax and abdomen for the purpose of dissecting\r\nthe sympathetic nerve. At noon Mr. Macnamara distinctly saw the heart\r\nbeating; there was a regular rythmical vermicular action of the right\r\nauricle and ventricle. The pericardium was open, the heart being freely\r\nexposed, and lying to the left in its natural position. The heart’s\r\naction, although regular, was very weak and slow. The left auricle was\r\nalso in action, but the left ventricle was contracted and rigid, and\r\napparently motionless. These spontaneous contractions continued till\r\nabout 12.45 p.m., and, further, the right side of this organ contracted\r\non the application of a stimulus, such as the point of a scalpel, &c.,\r\nfor a quarter of an hour longer.”--_Health_, May 21st, 1886, p. 121.\r\n\r\nBruhier in his work, “Dissertation sur l’Incertitude de la Mort et\r\nl’Abus des Enterrements,” records a number of cases of the supposed\r\ndead who, after burial, were revived at the dissecting table, together\r\nwith fifty-three that awoke in their coffins before being buried,\r\nfifty-two persons actually buried alive, and seventy-two other cases of\r\napparent death. This was at a time when body-snatching was in vogue,\r\nand it is a curious comment on our civilisation to be compelled to\r\nadmit that a subject of trance or catalepsy during the last or the\r\nearly part of the present century had a better chance of escape from so\r\nterrible a fate than now, when the vocation of the resurrection-man has\r\nbecome obsolete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nDEATH-CERTIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SELECT COMMITTEE of the House of Commons, under the chairmanship\r\nof Sir Walter Foster, M.D., was appointed on March 27, 1893, to\r\ninquire into the subject of death-certification in the United Kingdom.\r\nFourteen sittings were held, and thirty-two witnesses examined. All\r\nthe witnesses practically agreed as to the serious defects in the law,\r\nand a number of recommendations were made. It was shown that in about\r\nfour per cent. of the cases the cause of death was ill-defined and\r\nunspecified, many practitioners having forms specially printed for\r\ntheir own use, in which all mention of medical attendance is omitted,\r\nthe object being to enable the doctor to give certificates in cases\r\nwhich he has never attended. Numerous deaths attended by unqualified\r\npractitioners were certified by qualified practitioners who had\r\nprobably never seen the cases; and deaths were certified by medical\r\npractitioners who had not seen the patient for weeks or months prior\r\nto death, and who knew only by hearsay of the deaths having occurred.\r\nDeaths were also certified in which the true cause was suppressed in\r\ndeference to the feelings of survivors; these last in particular are\r\nreported to be very numerous.\r\n\r\n[INADEQUATE RECOMMENDATIONS.]\r\n\r\nIn Q. 2552-83, remarkable evidence was produced as to the reckless mode\r\nof death-certification. One medical witness testified that he saw a\r\ncertificate of death, signed by a registered medical practitioner,\r\ngiving both the fact and the cause of death of a man who was actually\r\nalive at the time, and who lived four days afterwards, with facts of\r\neven a more startling character described as “murder made easy.” It was\r\npointed out that fraud and irregularity in giving false declarations of\r\ndeath are by no means infrequent. Various other matters are treated,\r\nand the following are some of their recommendations:--\r\n\r\n 1. That in no case should a death be registered without the production\r\n of a certificate of the cause of death by a registered medical\r\n practitioner, or by a coroner after inquest, or, in Scotland, by a\r\n procurator-fiscal.\r\n\r\n 2. That in each sanitary district a registered medical practitioner\r\n should be appointed as public medical certifier of the cause of\r\n death in cases in which a certificate from a medical practitioner in\r\n attendance was not forthcoming.\r\n\r\n 3. That a medical practitioner in attendance should be required,\r\n before giving a certificate of death, to personally inspect the body,\r\n but if, on the ground of distance, or for other sufficient reason, he\r\n is unable to make this inspection himself, he should obtain and attach\r\n to the certificate of the cause of death a certificate signed by two\r\n persons, neighbours, verifying the fact of death.\r\n\r\n 4. That medical practitioners be required to send certificates of\r\n death direct to the registrar instead of handing them to the relatives\r\n of the deceased.\r\n\r\n 5. That a form of certificate of death should be prescribed, and that\r\n medical practitioners should be required to use such form.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Times_, May 23, 1896:--\r\n\r\n\r\n DEATH-CERTIFICATION.\r\n\r\n At the special meeting of the Metropolitan Counties Branch of the\r\n British Medical Association, held last night at the Museum of\r\n Practical Geology, Jermyn Street, the subject of an improvement in\r\n the present procedure in death-certification and registration came up\r\n for discussion. Sir W. Priestley, M.P., president, took the chair.\r\n\r\n Sir Henry Thompson moved the following resolution:--“Considering\r\n that a Select Committee of the House of Commons has in 1893 made\r\n an extended inquiry into the subject of death-certification and\r\n registration on the plan now followed in this country, and has\r\n reported that it manifestly fails to accomplish the purpose for\r\n which it was designed, this meeting is of opinion that Her Majesty’s\r\n Government should be respectfully memorialised to bring in a bill as\r\n soon as possible to give effect to an improved procedure in general\r\n accordance with the suggestions offered in the Committee’s report.”\r\n He said that, during the last twenty years or more, circumstances had\r\n not unfrequently occurred to attract public attention to the existence\r\n of grave defects in the system of death-certification adopted in this\r\n country, whether regarded as a safeguard against criminal attempts\r\n on life, or as a means of forming trustworthy records of disease for\r\n scientific purposes. From the Registrar-General’s report for England\r\n and Wales for the year 1892, it was shown that in fifteen thousand\r\n cases of death no inquiry had been made as to its cause, and that no\r\n certificate had been obtained from any source--a number amounting to\r\n nearly three per cent. on the total returned for the year. On the\r\n same authority it appeared that in twenty-five thousand more, or four\r\n and a half per cent., the cases “were so inadequately certified as\r\n not to be classifiable,” making together a class of seven and a half\r\n per cent. in which no evidence of any value as to the cause of death\r\n existed. After what had already been done in the matter, all that\r\n appeared to be necessary at present seemed to him to be that they\r\n should forward a memorial to the Home Secretary, with a request that\r\n he would consider the important work which had been already done by\r\n the Select Committee, and, if he saw fit, take steps to embody their\r\n recommendations in an Act of Parliament, for the purpose of giving the\r\n country a greatly improved procedure in exchange for that at present\r\n employed. Dr. Isambard Owen, in the absence of Dr. Farquharson, M.P.,\r\n seconded the resolution, and asserted that the State now winked at\r\n an exceedingly loose system of death-certification, since under\r\n the present procedure it was possible for a medical man to give a\r\n death-certificate on a patient whom he might not have seen for an\r\n interval of several weeks, and perhaps months. The resolution was\r\n supported by Dr. Nelson Hardy, Dr. Alderson, Dr. Hugh Woods, Dr.\r\n Sykes, and others, and was unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nA well-known physician in large practice, writing to the author from\r\na Midland town, October 10, 1895, says:--“Medical men, attending\r\npatients seriously ill, accept the statement of the friends that the\r\npatient died in the night, and give a certificate at once, without any\r\ninspection of the body. This is the regular practice.”\r\n\r\n[INTERMENTS WITHOUT CERTIFICATES.]\r\n\r\nIn Ireland matters are no better, and clergymen and others, with whom\r\nthe author has been in correspondence, say they are much worse, and\r\nthe danger of premature burial is, if possible, greater than it is in\r\nEngland. The Rev. W. Walters, writing from Ventry Parsonage, Dingle,\r\nIreland, September 16, 1895, says:--“In Ireland interment usually takes\r\nplace the day after decease, and no certificate as to the cause of\r\ndeath is ever required. There is no safeguard whatever, and amongst the\r\nignorant poor I fear premature burial is terribly frequent.”\r\n\r\nA prominent medical officer of health, having charge of a populous\r\nmetropolitan parish, wrote to the author, October 8, 1895, in reply to\r\ninquiries:--“When a doctor attends a patient in an illness, and the\r\npatient dies, he usually accepts the word of the friends as to the\r\nfacts of death, and if they are poor, or in moderate circumstances,\r\nhe grants the certificate in the ordinary way. If he is satisfied as\r\nto the cause of death he dare not refuse the certificate. You will\r\nsee by the form I send you that _he need not actually satisfy himself\r\nthat the patient is dead_; if he is not satisfied he writes, ‘As I\r\nam informed,’ in the space left for the words.... On one occasion\r\nI was directed by a lady to drive a very long hat-pin through her\r\nheart after death, to ensure that she should not be buried alive.\r\nI have given so little attention to the matter that I cannot say\r\nif the Continental practice in this respect is better than ours.\r\n_Signs of decomposition are, I believe, the only ones of any real\r\nvalue._ The form of certificate of death referred to is marked,\r\n‘Printed by authority of the Registrar-General,’ and a request marked\r\n‘N.B.’ is to read the suggestions on page ii. In this other form,\r\nwhich is entitled ‘Suggestions to medical practitioners respecting\r\ncertificates of the cause of death,’ elaborate instructions are set\r\nforth under ten separate clauses, with examples showing in what way the\r\ndeath-certificates are to be filled up, but not one word of instruction\r\nor caution as to the fact of death--whether it be real or apparent--the\r\nabsolute signs of death, or the steps to be taken in doubtful cases,\r\nor in the various forms of suspended animation, such as coma, trance,\r\ncatalepsy, etc.”\r\n\r\nThe _Times_, January 19, 1878, p. 9, foot of column 6, reports a\r\nsingular case in point:--\r\n\r\n“PREMATURE.--A poor woman lay very ill in her scantily-furnished home\r\nin Sheffield. The doctor was sent for, and came. He at once saw that\r\nhers was a very grave case, and that she had, as he thought, little\r\nchance of recovery, even if she could get the nourishment her illness\r\nrequired. As he was about to leave, the question was put, ‘When should\r\nwe send for you again, doctor?’ ‘Well,’ was the reply, as he looked at\r\nthe poor woman and then at her wretched surroundings, ‘I don’t think\r\nyou need send for me again. She cannot possibly get better; and to\r\nsave you further trouble I’ll just write you out a certificate for her\r\nburial.’ And he did. After the doctor departed the woman--women always\r\nwere wilful--got better rapidly. She has now completely recovered,\r\nand goes about carrying her burial certificate with her.--_Sheffield\r\nTelegraph._”\r\n\r\n[WORTHLESS DEATH-CERTIFICATES.]\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Cameron, M.P., in moving the introduction of the Disposal\r\nof the Dead (Regulation) Bill, in the House of Commons, on April 30,\r\n1884, said:--“A very large number of our population die without any\r\nmedical attendance at all, or at least without having ever received\r\nsufficient medical attention to enable a certificate of the cause of\r\ndeath to be given worth the paper on which it is written. In many\r\nof these cases some sort of worthless certificate is procured and\r\npresented to the registrar, but many thousands of persons are each year\r\nburied in the United Kingdom without even this formality.”\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the laxity at home and the regulations laid down\r\nby authority in Würtemburg, Bavaria, and other Continental States, is\r\nremarkable, and should receive the attention of the Registrar-General\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lancet_, 1890, vol. i., p. 1440:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“UNCERTIFIED CAUSES OF DEATH IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n“Considering the general progress that has been made in public health\r\nduring the last twenty years, it is seriously to be regretted that this\r\nmatter of unknown and uncertified causes of death has been practically\r\nleft untouched, and its settlement is, therefore more urgently needed\r\nnow than when so often pressed upon the public notice by the late\r\nDr. William Farr during his connection with the Registrar-General’s\r\ndepartment.”\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary Committee above referred to omitted an unexampled\r\nopportunity of inquiring into the facts of premature burial. They\r\ncould have summoned pathologists, who had made trance and catalepsy a\r\nsubject of close and searching investigation, as well as physicians,\r\nwho, in their practice, have been called in to decide upon cases of\r\napparent death, and of witnesses up and down the country who know\r\nof such cases, and others who have met with narrow escapes from\r\nthese horrible mishaps. Instead of taking this reasonable course of\r\nprocedure, the Committee contented themselves by examining two or\r\nthree medical men, who had been summoned to give evidence upon the\r\nirregularities of death-certification only, and whose negative and\r\napathetic replies showed either that the subject had never engaged\r\ntheir attention, or that they were unwilling to charge any member of\r\nthe profession with a fault so ruinous to his professional reputation\r\nas to be unable to discriminate between the living and the dead. No\r\nquestions were submitted to the witnesses as to the signs of death,\r\nthe characteristics of catalepsy, trance, asphyxia, syncope, etc., or\r\nhow to distinguish these from death, or as to the submission of tests\r\nin doubtful cases in order to ascertain the fact of death. Indeed, it\r\nmay be observed that the investigation regarding a most vital point\r\nconnected with death-certification appears to have entirely escaped\r\nthe notice of this tribunal. As a specimen of the proceedings under\r\nthis head are the following (“Report,” p. 116)--Mr. John Tatham, M.A.,\r\nM.D., being under examination by the chairman, Si Walter Foster, M.D.\r\n\r\n[RELUCTANT ANSWERS.]\r\n\r\n Q. 2112--Have you ever had any instances within your knowledge, or\r\n brought to your notice, of cases where persons have been buried\r\n alive?--Never.\r\n\r\n Q. 2113--Do you think such cases occur frequently?--I have no means of\r\n knowing.\r\n\r\n Q. 2114--Supposing the public think they do sometimes, your methods\r\n (of medical death-certification) would be a great barrier to anything\r\n like that?--Yes.\r\n\r\n Q. 2115--The doctor’s examination and identification of the body would\r\n enable them to detect in many instances if such an occurrence was\r\n likely to take place?--I think so.\r\n\r\nFurther questions were asked of the same witness by Dr. Farquharson.\r\n\r\n Q. 2178--You do not believe in people being buried alive?--I do not\r\n think that occurs in Manchester.\r\n\r\n Q. 2179--Do you think it occurs anywhere?--I do not know.\r\n\r\n Q. 2180--We read occasionally very horrifying descriptions of bodies\r\n having been found to have turned in their coffins. How do you explain\r\n that?--I am not able to explain it.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal_,\r\nJuly 22, 1893, p. 92, writes:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “PREMATURE BURIAL.\r\n\r\n “Sir,--The newspapers continue to give us fresh accounts of premature\r\n burials. Seeing how frequently cases are heard of (in spite of the\r\n exhumations being not one-thousandth per cent. of the interments), the\r\n occurrence is probably far more common than is generally supposed.\r\n It is, therefore, surprising that medical men have not discovered an\r\n infallible evidence of death--whatever the cause of death may be; or\r\n a simple means of proving, beyond the possibility of doubt, that life\r\n is extinct. Further, the application of such a test should, by law,\r\n be made to form part of the certificate of death.--I am, Sir, your\r\n obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  “LUX.\r\n\r\n “July 3.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVERIFICATION OF DEATHS.\r\n\r\n“In Paris and the large French towns medical inspectors, called\r\n_médecins verificateurs_, are appointed, whose business it is to visit\r\neach house where a death occurs, and ascertain that the person is\r\nreally dead, and that there are no suspicious circumstances connected\r\nwith his or her decease. More than eighty qualified medical men are\r\nemployed for this purpose in Paris.\r\n\r\n“In the rural districts of France this system is not in force; two\r\nwitnesses making a declaration to a civil officer that a death\r\nhas taken place, is considered sufficient. The burial is not\r\nallowed to take place until at least twenty-four hours after the\r\ndeclaration.”--_Blyth: Dictionary of Hygiene and Public Health._\r\n\r\n[VERIFICATIONS ILLUSORY.]\r\n\r\nDr. Léonce Lénormand, in his admirable work “Des Inhumations\r\nPrécipitées,” p. 140, accuses the _médecins des morts_ in France\r\nwith culpable carelessness in the exercise of their function, which\r\nconsists in verifying the reality of the death. Instead of making a\r\nminute examination of the body to ascertain the fact of death, this\r\nwriter says they are content (except in cases of death from violence)\r\nto merely glance at the body, and immediately to hand the family the\r\nnecessary authorisation for interment. The inspector knows that if\r\nhe examined every part of the body, as in duty bound, he would be\r\naccused of barbarism and profanation. Those, therefore, who think that\r\npremature burial could be prevented in England by means only of a more\r\nstringent law of compulsory death-certification, would, if it were\r\ncarried, find themselves in hardly any better position than at present,\r\nwhere the fact of death is left to a great extent to the judgment of\r\nfriends, if the deceased has any, or to the perfunctory inspection of\r\nthe undertaker. It is in France where probably, in spite of _médecins\r\nverificateurs_, more premature burials occur than in any country in\r\nEurope except Turkey, immediate burial after real or apparent death\r\nbeing the inexorable rule. Dr. Lénormand attributes the frequency\r\nof premature burials in France, first of all, to the negligence and\r\nprejudices of the families of the deceased; then to the carelessness of\r\nthe doctors charged by the State with the inspection of the dead; and\r\nlastly, to the imperfection of the police regulations.\r\n\r\nFrom the _British Medical Journal_, January 28, 1893, p. 204. (Special\r\nCorrespondence, Paris.)\r\n\r\n“PREMATURE BURIAL.\r\n\r\n“The question whether premature burial occurs, and how to prevent it,\r\nis, notwithstanding the all-absorbing interest of the Panama question,\r\nattracting some attention here. The ‘Union Medicale’ devotes one of\r\nits feuilletons to it, in which two or three _nouvelles à sensation_\r\nare reproduced, and easily proved to be untrue. Premature burial\r\ncannot occur, the writer says, when a death is duly verified. The\r\n77th Article of the Code obliges the _officier de l’état civil_ to\r\nvisit the death-bed and verify every death; but this Article is a\r\ndead letter. The officer in question has neither time nor knowledge\r\nsufficient to put it in practice. In small country places, rarely any\r\nprecautions are taken to prevent premature burials. In more important\r\nvillages and towns, the mayors delegate the doctors of the locality\r\nto verify deaths before burial. Throughout the whole of France, it\r\nappears that there are not fifty towns where the death-verifying\r\nservice is well organised; and, on an average, there are from twenty\r\nthousand to thirty thousand burials without previous verification of\r\ndeath. The declaration of two witnesses is sufficient, who obtain\r\ntheir information from those around the deceased. In Paris, the two\r\nmortuaries already in existence--one at the Montmartre Cemetery,\r\nthe other at Père La Chaise--are rarely used. The bodies of those\r\nwho die in the streets, from accident or sudden death, are taken\r\nthere when there is no domicile; also, those of foreigners who die\r\nin lodging-houses. In the course of eighteen months the mortuary of\r\nMontmartre received five dead bodies, and Père La Chaise one. In\r\nGermany the mortuaries are much used, and every arrangement made is in\r\norder that any who come back to life may be able to easily summon help.\r\nAt Munich, a ring in connection with a bell-cord is put on one of the\r\nfingers of the hands of the dead. At Frankfort, similar precautions are\r\ntaken.”\r\n\r\n[CONTINENTAL REGULATIONS.]\r\n\r\nExtracts from “Regulations for the Domiciliary Examination of the Dead\r\nin the City of Brussels Civil Government (Medical Service).”\r\n\r\n “ARTICLE 1.--The Medical Service of the Civil Government is\r\n distributed among the medical heads of divisions, the deputies and\r\n chiefs of the Department of Hygiene.”\r\n\r\n “ARTICLE 5.--No interment can take place except after the decease has\r\n been verified by the doctors of the Civil Government by means of a\r\n careful and complete examination of the corpse.”\r\n\r\nThis verification, as well as the identity of the person deceased,\r\nshall be certified by a _procès-verbal_ [statement, or description,\r\nfor which a blank is furnished “A”], which they shall leave at the\r\nhouse of the deceased.\r\n\r\n “ARTICLE 8.--They shall notify the officers of the Civil Government,\r\n and their superintendents of police, of any infractions of the\r\n regulation provisions which forbid proceeding with autopsy, moulding\r\n [making a cast?], embalmment, or putting in a coffin the corpse,\r\n before the death has been duly ascertained.”\r\n\r\n “ARTICLE 9.--The verification of the decease of still-born or of\r\n newly-born infants shall exact a most attentive examination on the\r\n part of the examining doctors. They shall indicate in their report if\r\n the infant has died before, during, or after birth; and, in the last\r\n case, how long it lived after birth.”\r\n\r\n “ARTICLE 10.--If they doubt the reality of the death, they shall\r\n employ, without delay, every means of recovery that science suggests\r\n under the circumstances. They shall immediately notify the visiting\r\n doctor, and, in every case, shall prepare the _procès-verbal_ of the\r\n verification of death only after certainty has been established, and,\r\n if need be, by repeated visits.”\r\n\r\n “ARTICLE 11.--When a woman has died in a state of advanced pregnancy,\r\n they shall direct the artificial extraction of the infant, supposed to\r\n be yet living; and, in the lack of an attending doctor, shall perform\r\n it themselves when necessary.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION AND CERTIFICATION OF THE DEAD IN WÜRTEMBURG.\r\n\r\nA Royal Decree, entitled “Dienst-Vorschriften für Leichenhaüser,”\r\nfor the inspection and burial of the dead, promulgated by the King\r\nof Würtemburg, January 24, 1884, provides for the appointment of\r\nmedical inspectors of the highest integrity and qualifications in\r\nevery commune, the position being justly regarded as one of great\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nImmediately after a death, the body must under no circumstances be\r\ninterfered with, and must not be removed from the death-bed until after\r\nthe authorised inspection. _Post-mortems_ can be made only if the fact\r\nof death has been previously clearly established. Precise instructions\r\nare laid down, so that the inspector, who is to examine the entire\r\nbody, may see that the various forms of suspended animation are not\r\ncertified as actual death. Amongst these are the following:--\r\n\r\n “Section ii.--To see that sensibility, pulsation of the heart, neck,\r\n temples, and forearm, and the breath, have ceased. That the muscles of\r\n the body have lost their elasticity; therefore the limbs are limp, the\r\n face sunken, the nose pinched, the eyes sunken, and, when the eyelids\r\n are forcibly opened, they remain so, the lower jaw drops more or less,\r\n and drops again when pressed upwards.\r\n\r\n “In actual death the body gradually gets colder, beginning with the\r\n exposed limbs, and in from ten to sixteen hours the body will be\r\n quite cold. The colour of the face becomes ashy pale, and the lips\r\n discoloured. The eye loses its brilliancy, and is usually dulled by a\r\n covering of dried mucus.\r\n\r\n “If all the foregoing symptoms are exhibited, and particularly if the\r\n deceased was of an advanced age, or if the death was caused by severe\r\n or long illness, which led to the expectation of a fatal result, the\r\n fact of death may be safely assumed.\r\n\r\n “But, on the other hand, if part of these symptoms are missing, or in\r\n cases of pregnancy, or exhaustion in consequence of flooding after\r\n confinement, or if death occurs under fits, or in violent outbursts\r\n of passion, the possibility of counterfeit-death is to be taken for\r\n granted.\r\n\r\n “Notwithstanding the existence of all the symptoms (signs of death)\r\n before mentioned, the possibility of _apparent_ death is not excluded\r\n in cases where the death has occurred after syncope, tetanus,\r\n suffocation, or in cases of drowning, stroke of lightning, or from a\r\n severe fall, or from frost, or in still-born children.”\r\n\r\nAfter detailing instructions as to a variety of experiments to\r\nascertain whether the death is actual or apparent, this Royal Decree\r\nproceeds:--\r\n\r\n “Section viii.--These experiments may, however, not give absolute\r\n certainty as to the complete extinction of all life. If, therefore,\r\n the slightest doubt remains as to the reality of death, the inspector\r\n is to take the necessary precautions for the protection of the\r\n deceased, by frequent inspections, and the most careful examinations,\r\n and to obtain the assistance of the nearest physician or surgeon, who\r\n is to co-operate with him to promote resuscitation. If these attempts\r\n prove abortive, he must see that nothing is done which would be\r\n detrimental to reanimation, or resumption of life.”\r\n\r\nThen follow minute instructions how to proceed under the varied\r\ncircumstances which may have produced the symptoms known as apparent\r\ndeath. _In no case must the burial certificate be handed over by the\r\ninspector until he has thoroughly satisfied himself of the presence of\r\nunmistakable signs of actual death._\r\n\r\nOne cannot help contrasting these carefully considered rules with\r\nthe lax and haphazard methods of dealing with the dead and apparent\r\ndead both in England and in the United States. As a consequence,\r\ncases of premature burial in Würtemburg are of very rare occurrence,\r\nand sensible people in that country, knowing that the danger of\r\npremature burial has been reduced to a minimum, are not consumed by an\r\never-abiding anxiety as with us, nor is it the custom for testators in\r\nWürtemburg to give instructions to their executors for piercing the\r\nheart or severing the jugular vein, or some other form of mutilation,\r\nas in France, Spain, and other countries, where the risks are so\r\nterribly great.\r\n\r\n[IN WÜRTEMBURG.]\r\n\r\nThe only case of the danger of premature burial that has come to the\r\nauthor’s notice in Würtemburg is related by Bouchut, in his “Signes de\r\nla Mort,” p. 48:--\r\n\r\n “In the village of Achen, in Würtemburg, Mrs. Eva Meyers, twenty-three\r\n years of age, was taken ill during an epidemic. Her condition became\r\n rapidly worse, and she apparently died. They put her into a coffin,\r\n and carried her from the warm into a cold room, there to await burial,\r\n which was to take place at two p.m. on the following day. Shortly\r\n after noon on that day, and before the carriers arrived, she awoke and\r\n made an effort to rise. Her aunt, who was present, and who believed\r\n that a ghost had taken possession of her, took a stick and would\r\n have killed her, if she had not been prevented by another woman.\r\n Nevertheless, she succeeded in pushing the body back violently into\r\n the coffin, after which she indignantly went to her room. The patient\r\n remained helplessly in that condition, and would have been buried if\r\n the usual hour for the burial had not for some reason been changed.\r\n Thus she remained for another twelve hours, when she was able to\r\n gather sufficient strength to arise. She still lives, and has paid\r\n the charges for her funeral, which were claimed by the clergy, the\r\n bell-ringer, and the undertaker.”\r\n\r\nIn the United States the subject of Death-Verification has only\r\nrecently begun to engage public attention. The following appears to\r\nbe the only instance in which reasonable, although not altogether\r\nadequate, precautions are adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n “DOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE.--CITY ORDINANCES, 1895.\r\n\r\n “CHAP. XVII.--VITAL STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n[AN AMERICAN CITY ORDINANCE.]\r\n\r\n “SECTION 3.--Whenever any person shall die within the limits of the\r\n city, it shall be the duty of the physician, attending such person,\r\n during his or her last sickness, to examine the body of such deceased\r\n person before the burial thereof, and to make out a certificate,\r\n setting forth, as far as the same may be ascertained, the name, age,\r\n colour, sex, nativity, occupation, whether married or single, duration\r\n of residence in the city, cause, date, and place of death of such\r\n deceased person; and it shall be the duty of the undertaker, or other\r\n person in charge of the burial of such deceased person, to add to such\r\n certificate the date and place of burial, and, having duly signed the\r\n same, to deposit it with the city clerk, and obtain a permit for\r\n burial; and, in the case of death from any contagious or infectious\r\n disease, said certificate shall be made and forwarded immediately;\r\n and, in each case of a physician so examining and reporting, he shall\r\n receive of the city a fee of one dollar.”\r\n\r\n “SECTION 4.--Whenever a permit for burial is applied for, in case of\r\n death without the attendance of a physician, or it is impossible to\r\n obtain a physician’s certificate, it shall be the duty of the city\r\n physician to make the necessary examination, and to investigate the\r\n case, and make and sign a certificate of the probable cause of death;\r\n and, if not satisfied as to the cause and circumstances attending such\r\n death, he shall so report to the mayor.”\r\n\r\n “SECTION 5.--No interment or disinterment of the dead body of any\r\n human being, or disposition thereof in any tomb, vault, or cemetery,\r\n shall be made within the city without a permit therefor, granted as\r\n aforesaid, nor otherwise than in accordance with such permit.\r\n\r\n “No undertaker, superintendent of cemetery, or other person shall\r\n assist in, assent to, or allow any such interment, or disinterment, to\r\n be made, until such permit has been given as aforesaid....\r\n\r\n “Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be\r\n fined not less than ten nor more than twenty dollars.”\r\n\r\nMr. A. Braxton Hicks, Barrister-at-Law, and Coroner for London and\r\nSurrey, states that--\r\n\r\n “The giving of certificates of death, and the registration of deaths,\r\n is regulated by 37 and 38 Vict. c. 88, called the Registration of\r\n Births and Deaths Act, its object being to provide a proper and\r\n accurate registration of births and deaths, with the causes of the\r\n latter.\r\n\r\n “In case of the death of any person who has been attended during his\r\n last illness by a registered medical practitioner, that practitioner\r\n shall sign and give to some person, required by this Act to give\r\n information concerning the death, a certificate stating, to the best\r\n of his knowledge and belief, the cause of death.\r\n\r\n “No certificate given by an unregistered medical man can be\r\n registered, and any person who covers an unregistered medical\r\n man by giving a certificate, or lending his name to the giving\r\n of a certificate by an unregistered medical man, is guilty of\r\n _unprofessional conduct_, as defined by the Medical Council.”--_Hints\r\n to Medical Men concerning the granting of Certificates of Death._\r\n\r\n\r\nA DOCTOR FOR THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Brindley James, in a communication to the _Medical Times_,\r\nMay 23, 1896, pp. 355-356, calls attention to the insufficient\r\nsafeguards against premature burial under the present system of\r\ndeath-certification, and observes--“The dread possibility of premature\r\ninterment ever hangs like a gloomy sword of Damocles over all our\r\nheads, and fearful indeed is the authentic record of persons buried\r\nalive, who have recovered consciousness; too late, alas! to be rescued\r\nfrom their frightful dungeon. How often does our overworked--we do not\r\nsay careless--practitioner sign the death-certificate of a patient\r\nwhose death-bed he did not attend--whose corpse he has not visited? And\r\neven assuming him to have done so, and conscientiously too, in how many\r\nof the fearful cases above alluded to have not these formalities proved\r\ninsufficient, clearly suggesting the advisability of a specialist,\r\nexperienced in _post-mortem_ inspection, solely sanctioning interment\r\nin all cases.” And Dr. Frederick Graves, writing in the same journal of\r\nJuly 18, 1896, says:--\r\n\r\n “I have recently heard of a case which illustrates the utility of\r\n a medical examination before burial. A soldier in the German army,\r\n during the forced march on Paris, became unconscious, with five\r\n others, from sunstroke, and the six were put aside for burial by\r\n their comrades, when the timely examination of the army surgeon\r\n prevented premature burial of the person referred to, who is alive and\r\n well at the present time.”\r\n\r\n[STRINGENT LEGISLATION SUGGESTED.]\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Chronicle_, London, September 16, 1895, in a leading article\r\non the danger of premature burial, says:--“The truth is, the whole\r\nsystem of certifying for burial needs to be reconsidered and reformed,\r\nand that for other reasons than the danger of entombment before life is\r\nextinct. We do not want a coroner’s inquest, with its jury, for every\r\ndeath; but the doctors should be compelled, under severe penalties, to\r\ndiscover the certain sign of death before they authorise the burial,\r\nand to know the cause of death in every case. We trust now too much to\r\nindividuals in a generally trustworthy profession, who may not reach\r\nthe high general standard of their class, or may grow listless through\r\nthe indifference wrought by use and wont, or who think they can detect\r\nthe _rigor mortis_ at a glance, never having seen the severest form\r\nof catalepsy. There would be no difficulty in getting Parliament to\r\npass a more stringent regulation for death-certificates without much\r\ndiscussion, and there is no reason why Sir Matthew White Ridley should\r\nnot turn his attention to the matter, and, with such medical advice as\r\nthe Health Department of the Local Government Board will be pleased to\r\nlend him, propose a necessary little bill to the House of Commons next\r\nFebruary.”\r\n\r\nThe following letter by a German resident in England appeared in the\r\n_Times_ of September 20, 1895:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “BURIED ALIVE.\r\n\r\n “Sir,--As this important subject appears to be arresting the\r\n attention of the public in England, may I venture to state the law\r\n as to the examination of corpses in my own country? In a copy of\r\n the official regulations in Würtemburg for the inspection of dead\r\n bodies (‘Dienst-Vorschriften für Leichenhaüser in Würtemburg, 1882.’\r\n Stuttgart, W. Kohlhammer), I find the following:--\r\n\r\n “‘No corpse must be interfered with before the arrival of the\r\n inspector, who is expected to pay several visits before granting the\r\n death-certificate, which he alone is authorised to do. In cases of\r\n death from infectious disease the body must be removed to a mortuary,\r\n where it is carefully watched.’\r\n\r\n “These inspectors are highly qualified, State-appointed physicians,\r\n but, as if to show the uncertainty of all this care and experience,\r\n as we see by the researches of Dormodoff, Hufeland, Hartmann, and\r\n others, as well as by the reports of startling cases in the press,\r\n those medically and officially declared to be dead do occasionally\r\n come to life before burial. This is a state of things unworthy of the\r\n civilisation and humanity of which we are proud.\r\n\r\n “Medical examination, not being infallible when carried out at its\r\n best, must be very unreliable when performed in a careless manner.\r\n\r\n “A safer plan would be to send every supposed corpse to a mortuary,\r\n there to remain until decomposition manifests itself. As a German I\r\n should be afraid to die in England (excuse the paradox) for fear of\r\n being buried alive.\r\n\r\n  “P. P.\r\n\r\n “Forest Hill, September 17.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR PREVENTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE learned Dr. Vigné, of Rouen, who won the respect of his\r\nfellow-citizens during a long and honourable career, was for many years\r\nengaged in the study of this question, and published the result of his\r\nresearches shortly before his death. Convinced that the resources of\r\nscience were insufficient to distinguish real from apparent death, he\r\nleft testamentary instructions to provide against his own premature\r\nburial. (“Des Inhumations Précipitées, p. 83,” by Lénormand.)\r\n\r\nDr. Winslow, a French physician, who had on two different occasions\r\nvery nearly fallen a victim to premature burial, having been laid out\r\nfor dead, chose for the subject of his thesis before the Paris Faculty\r\nof Medicine, “Les moyens les plus propres à reconnaître la réalité\r\nde la mort.” Dr. Winslow may be said to have been the pioneer of a\r\nmovement in France for exposing the danger of, and educating the public\r\ninto the necessity of reforms in, the mode of treating the apparent\r\ndead; and, although his efforts and warnings were as of one crying\r\nin the wilderness or amongst an apathetic people, with a legislature\r\napparently uninfluenced either by facts or by reason, they were never\r\nrelaxed. Numerous writers have since confirmed the truth of Dr.\r\nWinslow’s contention by facts within their own experience, and it is\r\nbelieved that legislation in France cannot be much longer delayed.\r\n\r\nThat the risk of premature burial is not an imaginary one, as recently\r\ndeclared by a leading London medical journal, has been shown by the\r\ncitation in this volume of cases of death-like trance which have\r\nbaffled the ablest of medical experts; also the instances of numerous\r\nnarrow escapes from this terrible occurrence, and of others where the\r\nvictims were suffocated before timely aid could be obtained, most of\r\nwhich are drawn from medical sources, and some from the columns of\r\nthe said sceptical journal. The painful reality is also shown by the\r\nmultitude of preventive measures suggested by medical authorities, and\r\nby the ingenious contrivances of those who have made this distressing\r\nsubject one of patient and laborious research. Several of the remedies\r\nsuggested for adoption in cataleptic cases are really homicidal, or\r\nseriously mutilative; many of them are impracticable, and have been\r\nshown by Hufeland, Lénormand, Richardson, Hartmann, Bouchut, Fletcher,\r\nand Gannal to be delusive. The merits and demerits of some of these\r\nmethods might be inquired into by the appointment of a Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, or a Royal Commission, as a supplement to that appointed in\r\n1893, by Mr. Asquith, on Death-Certification.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTANEOUS EXCITATION.\r\n\r\nDr. James Curry, F.R.S., in his “Observations on Apparent Death,” pp.\r\n56, 57, says, concerning the application of stimulants to the skin:--\r\n\r\n “To assist in rousing the activity of the vital principle, it has been\r\n customary to apply various stimulating matters to different parts\r\n of the body. But, as some of these applications are in themselves\r\n positively hurtful, and the others serviceable only according to the\r\n time and manner of their employment, it will be proper to consider\r\n them particularly.\r\n\r\n “The application of all such matters in cases of apparent death is\r\n founded upon the supposition that the skin still retains sensibility\r\n enough to be affected by them. It is well known, however, that even\r\n during life the skin loses sensibility in proportion as it is deprived\r\n of heat, and does not recover it again until the natural degree of\r\n warmth be restored. Previous to the restoration of heat, therefore, to\r\n a drowned body, all stimulating applications are useless, and, so far\r\n as they interfere with the other measures, are also prejudicial.”\r\n\r\nSeveral writers, besides Dr. Winslow, whose views on premature burial\r\nare cited in this volume, have themselves been the victims of hasty\r\nand erroneous medical diagnosis; and, having had narrow escapes of\r\npremature burial, their experience has prompted them to take a deep\r\ninterest in the subject, with the determination to do what they could\r\nto enlighten and safeguard the public from so terrible a danger. In\r\nother cases, members of their families have been the unhappy victims\r\nof mistaken certificates. Mr. George T. Angell, the editor of “_Dumb\r\nAnimals_,” Boston, U.S., whose father was pronounced by his physician\r\ndead, and returned to consciousness after preparations for the funeral\r\nhad been made, has repeatedly alluded to the subject in his paper,\r\nand published preventive suggestions at various times, including the\r\nfollowing from a physician:--\r\n\r\n “When I arrived, the man had been dead twenty-four hours. I empanelled\r\n a jury; the family of the deceased testified to the extent of their\r\n knowledge; but I was unable to find he had any disease sufficient\r\n to kill him. I looked at the body and examined it carefully. Then I\r\n lighted a match, and applied it to the end of one of the fingers of\r\n the corpse. Immediately a blister formed. I had the man put back into\r\n his bed, applied various restoratives, and to-day he is alive and\r\n well.\r\n\r\n “That is the test. Do you see the philosophy of it? If you are alive,\r\n you cannot burn your hand without raising a blister. Nature, in the\r\n effort to protect the inner tissues, throws a covering of water, a\r\n non-conductor of heat, between the fire and the flesh. If you were\r\n dead, and flames should come in contact with any part of your body, no\r\n blister would appear, and the flesh would be burned.\r\n\r\n “All you have to do is to apply a match to any part of the supposed\r\n corpse. If life remains, however little, a blister will at once form.”\r\n\r\nThe test, like the following one, is deceptive, because life may be so\r\ntorpid and inactive as to be unable to respond to the irritation of\r\nheat, or even to the application of red hot irons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLISTER TEST.\r\n\r\nThe _British Medical Journal_, January 18, 1896, p. 180, under the head\r\nof “Living or Dead?” prints the following communication concerning this\r\ntest:--\r\n\r\n[THE BLISTER TEST.]\r\n\r\n “Sir,--Burial alive, though of exceedingly rare occurrence, sometimes\r\n does happen, and calls for increased attention to the means of\r\n detecting with certainty the presence of vitality, however feeble.\r\n The ordinary means of deciding the vital question are known to all\r\n persons. Auscultation may detect the enfeebled heart-beat, while the\r\n electric battery can elicit any existing muscular contractility.\r\n Conditions of trance are occasionally almost mystical in their\r\n profundity (Brahmin trance), and a simple and ready-to-hand test to\r\n decide whether death has occurred is of prime importance. We can\r\n ascertain whether or not life still lingers in uncertain cases by\r\n applying (say) to the back of the forearm a small stream of boiling\r\n water directly from the kettle. If life is present, the boiling water\r\n will soon and unfailingly raise a blister where applied, and the\r\n blister will contain fluid, the serum of the blood. The production of\r\n the serum blister being essentially a vital process, its production\r\n or non-production becomes an infallible test, and determines the\r\n question. This test, not generally known, should be widely proclaimed.\r\n\r\n  “J. MILFORD BARNETT, M.D., Edin.\r\n\r\n “Belfast, January 11, 1896.”\r\n\r\nThis test has frequently failed, and should not be relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[AUSCULTATION.]\r\n\r\nAUSCULTATION.\r\n\r\nThe stethoscope, which is regarded by many medical practitioners as an\r\ninfallible means of preventing premature burial, has proved a broken\r\nreed in hundreds of cases, and can be of use only when applied with\r\nother tests. Dr. Roger S. Chew, of Calcutta, writes to me, February,\r\n1896:--\r\n\r\n“The _British Medical Journal_ (September 28, 1895) tells us that the\r\ncareful use of the stethoscope will enable a medical man to distinguish\r\na living from a dead body. Auscultation may give startling results,\r\nand the body yet be absolutely dead. I recollect an instance of death\r\nfrom cobra-bite, when, though decomposition had set in, the relatives\r\nrefused to believe she was dead, because one of them declared that,\r\nthough he did not see her chest rise and fall, he had distinctly heard\r\nher sigh. A medical man was called in, applied the stethoscope over\r\nher thorax, and declared he could hear sounds from her lungs, and a\r\npeculiar ‘_sough_,’ ‘_sough_’ towards the apex of the heart. So far he\r\nwas right, but, as the girl had already been dead some fourteen hours,\r\nand the weather was warm, the sounds he heard were those of the escape\r\nof the putrefactive gases bubbling upward and unable to find exit, as\r\nher mouth was closed with a chin-bandage, and her nostrils plugged with\r\nmucus. To convince the parents that the girl was really dead, I offered\r\nto perform artificial respiration, to which end I untied the bandage,\r\nprized open her jaws, and pressed _heavily_ on her thorax, when some of\r\nthe imprisoned gases escaped, emitting an abominable odour that brought\r\nconviction of the girl being beyond all hope.\r\n\r\n“In another case, that of my son, aged two years, after a series of\r\nbrain symptoms and severe clonic convulsions preceding an outbreak\r\nof confluent small-pox, the stethoscope told me and a medical friend\r\nwho was present that my little boy had ceased to exist; but a liberal\r\napplication of ice to his head and cardiac region, together with\r\nviolent friction and artificial respiration vigorously employed for\r\n_forty_ minutes, restored the child to me, and I thanked God that I had\r\nrefused to accept the evidence of the stethoscope as final.”\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nThe application of the electric current is a powerful restorative agent\r\nin cases of suspended animation, if judiciously applied. Struve in\r\nhis essay, “Suspended Animation,” p. 151, under the head of “Apparent\r\ndeath from a fall,” says:--“A girl, three years of age, fell from a\r\nwindow two stories high upon the pavement. Though she was considered\r\nas lifeless, Mr. Squires, a natural philosopher, applied electricity.\r\nAlmost twenty minutes elapsed before the shocks produced any effect. At\r\nlast when some of the electric force pervaded the breast he observed a\r\nslight motion of the heart. The child soon after began to breathe and\r\ngroan with great difficulty, and after some minutes a vomiting ensued.\r\nFor a few days the patient remained in a state of stupefaction, but in\r\nthe course of a week she was perfectly restored to health.”\r\n\r\n[THE ELECTRICAL TEST.]\r\n\r\nReferring to the subject of premature burial, Dr. W. S. Hedley, writing\r\nto the _Lancet_, October 5, 1895, says:--“Forty years ago the subject\r\nwas investigated by Crimotel, twenty years later by Rosenthal, and more\r\nrecently by Onimus. It seems safe to say that in no disease, certainly\r\nin none of those conditions usually enumerated as likely to be mistaken\r\nfor death, is galvanic and faradaic excitability abolished in every\r\nmuscle of the body. On the other hand, electro-muscular contractility\r\ndisappears in all the muscles within a few hours after death\r\n(generally ninety minutes to three hours, according to Rosenthal), its\r\npersistence varying to some extent with the particular muscle examined\r\n(1), and with the mode of death (2). Therefore, if electro-muscular\r\ncontractility be present in any muscle, it means life or death only\r\na few hours before. It is clear that no interment or _post-mortem_\r\nexamination ought to take place so long as there is any flicker of\r\nelectric excitability. To me it seems almost equally obvious that in\r\nall doubtful cases, sometimes in sudden death, and often to allay the\r\nanxiety of friends, this test ought to be applied, and applied by\r\none who is accustomed to handle electric currents for purposes of\r\ndiagnosis.”\r\n\r\nThe _Medical Record_, New York, March 30, 1895, contains the\r\nfollowing:--“In a case reported by M. D’Arsonval, a man was struck with\r\na current of four thousand five hundred volts. The current entered at\r\nhis hand and issued at his back. Half an hour or more elapsed before\r\nany attempts at resuscitation were made, but, on artificial respiration\r\nbeing practised on Silvester’s method, recovery took place. Dr.\r\nDonnellan reports a case of the passage of a current of one thousand\r\nvolts through a man, which instantly caused coma, dilated pupils,\r\npallor of the face, and sweating; delirium and tonic, alternating\r\nwith clonic, spasms followed. The pulse was eighty. The respiration,\r\nat first stertorous, passed into the Cheyne-Stokes type. After the\r\ninjection, first of morphia, and then of strychnia, the patient fell\r\ninto a deep sleep, from which he awoke convalescent.--_Centralblatt für\r\ndie medicinischen Wissenschaften._”\r\n\r\nThe apparatus for applying electrical currents, long used by the\r\nHumane Society for restoration of the drowned, might with advantage\r\nbe kept at public mortuaries, for use in cases of apparent death due\r\nto other causes, where decomposition has not manifested itself. The\r\nWeather Bureau at Washington advises those who are in the neighbourhood\r\nof persons struck by lightning to make immediate efforts to restore\r\nconsciousness, because the effect of lightning is to suspend animation\r\nrather than to produce death. Respiration and circulation should be\r\nstimulated, and the usual remedies for relief in such cases should be\r\nadministered for at least an hour before giving up the victim as dead.\r\n\r\nDr. Moore Russell Fletcher says:--“When persons without pulse or\r\nbreathing are found in bed, in the field, or elsewhere, treat them\r\nin such manner as will restore from stroke of lightning, paralysis,\r\nor suspended animation from catalepsy, trance, or somnambulism, and\r\ncontinue the treatment until resuscitation rewards the exertions, or\r\ndecomposition is evident.”--_Suspended Animation, pp. 7, 8._\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPODERMIC INJECTIONS.\r\n\r\nMr. E. E. Carpmael, of the Medical Department, Berkeley University,\r\nU.S.A., recommends, in the _Morning Post_, London, September 19,\r\n1895, the injection of strychnine in “a supposed corpse;” while\r\n“Medicus,” in the _Daily Chronicle_, September 17, 1895, considers\r\nthat _post-mortems_ “would be to the advantage of the patient, to\r\nhis relations, to science, and the community at large.” No doubt\r\neither of these plans would prevent live sepulture, by killing the\r\ncataleptic subject; while “M.R.C.S.,” in _Morning Post_, September\r\n20, says:--“Obviously the simplest and best proof of death is\r\nputrefaction--shown chiefly by the discolouration of the abdomen.”\r\n\r\n[HYPODERMIC INJECTIONS.]\r\n\r\nA correspondent in the _English Mechanic_, October 25, 1895, says:--“I\r\nhave long advised hypodermic injection of morphia before placing in\r\ncoffin for burial. _Ex hypothesi_, the vital spark is not supposed to\r\nhave expired, and the circulatory system not finally stopped. Hence the\r\nhypodermic injection cannot be futile.”\r\n\r\nA medical correspondent writing from Dresden, August 18, 1895, sends me\r\nthe following as showing the value of\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION.\r\n\r\n“Major J. H. Patzki, Surgeon, U.S. Army, reports that in 1882, at St.\r\nAugustine, Florida, a lady patient of his had an attack of tetanus,\r\ncaused by a scratch upon her foot by a nail while bathing. The\r\nconvulsive symptoms commenced in the muscles of the face, and increased\r\nin violence in spite of energetic treatment, until the fifth day, when\r\nthe respiratory muscles became involved. The breathing was completely\r\nsuspended by the spasmodic action, and the radial and carotid pulse\r\nceased. The cardiac sounds became utterly inaudible to careful\r\nstethoscopic examination repeatedly employed. The lady assumed all\r\nthe appearances of death, and there was _rigor mortis_, the result of\r\nmuscular spasm. Artificial respiration was resorted to, but not until\r\nafter the expiration of eighteen minutes did the first faint efforts\r\nof respiration, and a feeble action of the heart, become perceptible.\r\nArtificial respiration was continued for an hour afterwards, and the\r\nlife of the patient was saved, although the muscular spasms continued\r\nto some extent for six days.\r\n\r\n“This case is instructive in showing that tetanus, when it involves the\r\nchest, may produce a state of apparent death, by interfering with the\r\nrespiratory and cardiac functions; and that artificial respiration, if\r\npersistently employed, may rescue patients so affected from the perils\r\nof apparent death.”\r\n\r\n[DR. JOHN OSWALD’S OPINION.]\r\n\r\nDr. John Oswald, in “Suspended Animal Life,” Philadelphia, 1802, p.\r\n65, says:--“The books of authors on this subject are replete with\r\ncriteria to judge of the existence or non-existence of the vital\r\nprinciple. It is not necessary to take a separate view of the propriety\r\nor impropriety of adopting any of these ambiguous signs, when we have\r\nthe accomplishment of so great an end as that of restoring suspended\r\nlife! Our exertions should never be influenced by any of them, but\r\ncontinued with ardour and unremitted attention for a length of time.\r\nIt would be more happy for our unfortunate patients, and a source of\r\ngreater satisfaction to ourselves, were they expunged altogether. They\r\nare all fallacious to a certain degree, and ought never to have the\r\nsmallest influence on the propriety or impropriety of persevering in\r\nour attempts to revive the latent spark; for it is an unfortunate fact,\r\nin consequence of an ignorant confidence placed in them, that persons\r\nwho might have been restored to life, to their friends, and to society\r\nhave been consigned to the grave.... This important subject has been\r\nanxiously investigated by philosophers, to discover a just criterion of\r\njudging with more certainty in these cases whether life is extinct, and\r\nour patient a mass of dead matter, or whether, by our perseverance, he\r\nmay not be again recovered. The most indubitable sign is allowed to be\r\nputrefaction of the body, or disorganisation of the fibre.”\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from an instructive but apparently forgotten\r\narticle in Dickens’ “All the Year Round,” July, 1869 (_à propos_ of a\r\npamphlet, “Lettre sur la Mort Apparente, les Conséquences Réelles des\r\nInhumations Précipitées, et le Temps pendant lequel peut persister\r\nl’Aptitude à être rappellé à la Vie,” by the late regretted Dr.\r\nCharles Londe), afford valuable suggestions:--\r\n\r\n “Suffocation by foul air and mephitical gas is not a rare form of\r\n death in the United Kingdom. It is possible that suspended animation\r\n may now and then have been mistaken for the absolute extinction\r\n of life. Dr. Londe gives an instructive case to the purpose. At\r\n the extremity of a large grocer’s shop, a close, narrow corner, or\r\n rather hole, was the sleeping-place of the shopman who managed the\r\n night sale till the shop was closed, and who opened the shutters at\r\n four in the morning. On the 16th of January, 1825, there were loud\r\n knocks at the grocer’s door. As nobody stirred to open it, the grocer\r\n rose himself, grumbling at the shopman’s laziness, and, proceeding\r\n to his sleeping-hole to scold him, he found him motionless in bed,\r\n completely deprived of consciousness. Terror-struck by the idea of\r\n sudden death, he immediately sent in search of a doctor, who suspected\r\n a case of asphyxia by mephitism. His suspicions were confirmed by\r\n the sight of a night-lamp, which had gone out, although supplied\r\n with oil and wick, and by a portable stove containing the remains\r\n of charcoal partly reduced to ashes. In spite of a severe frost, he\r\n immediately had the patient taken into the open air, and kept on a\r\n chair in a position as nearly vertical as possible. The limbs of the\r\n sufferer hung loose and drooping, the pupils were motionless, with\r\n no trace either of breathing or pulsation of the heart or arteries;\r\n in short, there were all the signs of death. The most approved modes\r\n of restoring animation were persisted in for a long while without\r\n success. At last, about three in the afternoon--that is, after _eleven\r\n hours’_ continued exertion--a slight movement was heard in the region\r\n of the heart. A few hours afterwards the patient opened his eyes,\r\n regained consciousness, and was able to converse with the spectators\r\n attracted by his resurrection. Dr. Londe draws the same conclusions\r\n as before--namely, that persons suffocated by mephitism are not\r\n unfrequently buried when they might be saved.”\r\n\r\n [DANGER TO CHOLERA PATIENTS.]\r\n\r\n “We have had cholera in Great Britain, and we may have it again.\r\n At such trying times, if ever, hurried interments are not merely\r\n excusable, but almost unavoidable. Nevertheless, one of the\r\n peculiarities of that fearful disease is to bring on some of the\r\n symptoms of death--the prostration, the coldness, and the dull livid\r\n hues--long before life has taken its departure. Now, Dr. Londe states,\r\n as an acknowledged fact, that patients pronounced dead of cholera have\r\n been repeatedly seen to move one or more of their limbs after death.\r\n While M. Trachez (who had been sent to Poland to study the cholera)\r\n was opening a subject in the dead-house of the Bagatelle Hospital, in\r\n Warsaw, he saw another body (that of a woman of fifty, who had died\r\n in two days, having her eyes still bright, her joints supple, but\r\n the whole surface extremely cold) which vividly moved its left foot\r\n ten or twelve times in the course of an hour. Afterwards, the right\r\n foot participated in the same movement, but very feebly. M. Trachez\r\n sent for Mr. Searle, an English surgeon, to direct his attention\r\n to the phenomenon. Mr. Searle _had often remarked it_. The woman,\r\n nevertheless, was left in the dissecting-room, and thence taken to the\r\n cemetery. Several other medical men stated that they had made similar\r\n observations. From which M. Trachez draws the inference: ‘It is\r\n allowable to think that many cholera patients have been buried alive.’”\r\n\r\n “Dr. Veyrat, attached to the Bath Establishment, Aix, Savoy, was\r\n sent for to La Roche (Department of the Yonne), to visit a cholera\r\n patient, Thérèse X., who had lost all the members of her family by\r\n the same disease. He found her in a complete state of asphyxia. He\r\n opened a vein; not a drop of blood flowed. He applied leeches; they\r\n bit, and immediately loosed their hold. He covered the body with\r\n stimulant applications, and went to take a little rest, requesting to\r\n be called if the patient manifested any signs of life. The night and\r\n next day passed without any change. While making preparations for the\r\n burial, they noticed a little blood oozing out of the leech-bites.\r\n Dr. Veyrat, informed of the circumstance, entered the chamber just as\r\n the nurse was about to wrap the corpse in its winding-sheet. Suddenly\r\n a rattling noise issued from Thérèse’s chest. She opened her eyes,\r\n and in a hollow voice said to the nurse: ‘What are you doing here?\r\n I am not dead. Get away with you.’ She recovered, and felt no other\r\n inconvenience than a deafness, which lasted about two months.”\r\n\r\n “Exposure to cold may also induce a suspension of vitality liable to\r\n be mistaken for actual death. This year the French Senate has again\r\n received several petitions relative to premature interments.... And,\r\n considering the length of time that trances, catalepsies, lethargies,\r\n and cases of suspended animation have been known occasionally to\r\n continue, it is scarcely, in England, less interesting to us, though\r\n public feeling, which is only an expression of natural affection,\r\n approves, and indeed almost compels, a longer delay. The attention\r\n of the French Government being once more directed to the subject,\r\n there is little doubt that all reasonable grounds for fear will be\r\n removed.[20]\r\n\r\n “The petitioners have requested, as a precaution, that all burials for\r\n the future should, in the first instance, be only provisional. Before\r\n filling a grave, a communication is to be made between the coffin and\r\n the upper atmosphere by means of a respiratory tube; and the grave is\r\n not to be finally closed until all hope of life is abandoned. These\r\n precautions, it will be seen at once, however good in theory, are\r\n scarcely practicable. Others have demanded the general establishment\r\n of mortuary chambers, or dead-houses, like those in Germany. And not\r\n only the petitioners, but several senators, seem to consider that\r\n measure the full solution of the problem. Article 77 of the Civil Code\r\n prescribes a delay of twenty-four hours only, which appears to them\r\n to be insufficient, since, they urge, it admits the certainty that\r\n death has taken place only after putrefactive decomposition has set\r\n in. Now, a much longer time than twenty-four hours may elapse before\r\n that decomposition manifests itself. Deposit, therefore, your dead in\r\n a mortuary chapel, until you are perfectly sure, from the evidence of\r\n your senses, that life is utterly and hopelessly extinct.\r\n\r\n [DIFFICULTY OF DIAGNOSIS.]\r\n\r\n “When Article 77 of the Civil Code was under discussion by the Council\r\n of State, Fourcroy added: ‘It shall be specified that the civil\r\n officer be assisted by an officier de santé (a medical man of inferior\r\n rank to a doctor of medicine); because there are cases in which it is\r\n difficult to make certain that death has actually occurred, without a\r\n thorough knowledge of its symptoms, and because there are tolerably\r\n numerous examples to prove that people _have_ been buried alive.’\r\n\r\n “In Paris, especially since Baron Hausmann’s administration, Article\r\n 77 has been strictly fulfilled; but the same exactitude cannot be\r\n expected in out-of-the-way nooks and corners of the country, where\r\n a doctor cannot always be found at a minute’s warning, to declare\r\n whether death be real or apparent only. It is clear that the\r\n Legislature has hit upon the sole indisputable practical solution; the\r\n difficulty lies in its rigorous and efficient application.\r\n\r\n “It has been judiciously remarked that it would be a good plan to\r\n spread the knowledge of the sure and certain characteristics which\r\n enable us to distinguish every form of lethargy from real death. It\r\n cannot be denied that at the present epoch the utmost pains are taken\r\n to popularise every kind of knowledge. Nevertheless, it makes slow way\r\n through the jungles of prejudice and vulgar error. Not long ago it was\r\n over and over again asserted that an infallible mode of ascertaining\r\n whether a person was dead or not was to inflict a burn on the sole of\r\n the foot. If a blister full of water resulted, the individual was not\r\n dead; if the contrary happened, there was no further hope. This error\r\n was unhesitatingly accepted as an item of the popular creed.\r\n\r\n “The Council of Hygiene, applied to by the Government, indicated\r\n putrefaction and cadaverous rigidity as infallible signs of actual\r\n death. In respect to the first--putrefaction--a professional man is\r\n not likely to make a mistake; but nothing is more possible than for\r\n non-professionals to confound hospital rottenness (gangrene) with true\r\n _post-mortem_ putrefaction. M. de Parville declines to admit it as a\r\n test adapted for popular application. Moreover, in winter, the time\r\n required for putrefaction to manifest itself is extremely uncertain.\r\n\r\n “The cadaverous rigidity--the stiffness of a corpse--offers an\r\n excellent mode of verifying death; but its value and importance are\r\n not yet appreciable by everybody, or by the first comer. Cadaverous\r\n rigidity occurs a few hours after death; the limbs, hitherto supple,\r\n stiffen; and it requires a certain effort to make them bend. But when\r\n once the faculty of bending a joint is forcibly restored--to the\r\n arm, for instance--it will not stiffen again, but will retain its\r\n suppleness. If the death be real, the rigidity is overcome once for\r\n all. But if the death be only apparent, the limbs quickly resume, with\r\n a sudden and jerking movement, the contracted position which they\r\n previously occupied. The stiffness begins at the top, the head and\r\n neck, and descends gradually to the trunk.\r\n\r\n “These characteristics are very clearly marked; but they must be\r\n caught in the fact, and at the moment of their appearance, because,\r\n after a time of variable duration, they disappear. The contraction\r\n of the members no longer exists, and the suppleness of the joints\r\n returns. Many other symptoms might be added to the above; but\r\n they demand still greater clearness of perception, more extended\r\n professional knowledge, and more practised habits of observation.\r\n\r\n “Although the French Government is anxious to enforce throughout the\r\n whole empire the rules carried out in Paris, it is to be feared that\r\n great difficulties lie in the way. The verification of deaths on so\r\n enormous a scale, with strict minuteness, is almost impracticable.\r\n But, even if it were not, many timid persons would say: ‘Who is\r\n to assure us of the correctness of the doctor’s observations?\r\n Unfortunately, too many terrible examples of their fallibility are on\r\n record. The professional man is pressed for time. He pays a passing\r\n visit; gives a hurried glance; and a fatal mistake is so easily made!’\r\n Public opinion will not be reassured until you can show, every time a\r\n death occurs, an irrefutable demonstration that life has departed.\r\n\r\n “M. de Parville now announces the possibility of this great\r\n desideratum. He professes to place in any one’s hands a self-acting\r\n apparatus which would declare not only whether the death be real,\r\n but _would leave in the hands of the experimenter a written proof of\r\n the reality of the death_. The scheme is this: It is well known that\r\n atropine--the active principle of _belladonna_--possesses the property\r\n of considerably dilating the pupil of the eye. Oculists constantly\r\n make use of it when they want to perform an operation, or to examine\r\n the interior of the eye. Now, M. le Docteur Bouchut has shown that\r\n atropine has no action on the pupil when death is real. In a state of\r\n lethargy, the pupil, under the influence of a few drops of atropine,\r\n dilates in the course of a few minutes; the dilatation also takes\r\n place a few instants after death; but it ceases absolutely in a\r\n quarter of an hour, or half an hour at the very longest; consequently\r\n the enlargement of the pupil is a certain sign that death is only\r\n apparent.\r\n\r\n [AN INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCE.]\r\n\r\n “This premised, imagine a little camera obscura, scarcely so big as an\r\n opera-glass, containing a slip of photographic paper, which is kept\r\n unrolling for five-and-twenty or thirty minutes by means of clockwork.\r\n This apparatus, placed a short distance in front of the dead person’s\r\n eye, will depict on the paper the pupil of the eye, which will have\r\n been previously moistened with a few drops of atropine. It is evident\r\n that, as the paper slides before the eye of the corpse, if the pupil\r\n dilate, its photographic image will be dilated; if, on the contrary,\r\n it remains unchanged, the image will retain its original size. An\r\n inspection of the paper then enables the experimenter to read upon it\r\n whether the death is real or apparent only. This sort of declaration\r\n can be handed to the civil officer, who will give a permit to bury in\r\n return.\r\n\r\n “By this simple method a hasty or careless certificate of death\r\n becomes impossible. The instrument applies the test, and counts the\r\n minutes. The doctor and the civil officer are relieved from further\r\n responsibility. The paper gives evidence that the verification has\r\n actually and carefully been made; for suppose that half an hour is\r\n required to produce a test that can be relied on, the length of the\r\n strip of paper unrolled marks the time during which the experiment has\r\n been continued. An apparatus of the kind might be placed in the hands\r\n of the minister or one of the notables of every parish. Such a system\r\n would silence the apprehensions of the most timid; fears--natural\r\n enough--would disappear, and the world would be shocked by no fresh\r\n cases of premature burial.”\r\n\r\nThe authors have not heard whether this ingenious contrivance had been\r\nput into practice, or with what result.\r\n\r\nVarious prizes have been offered, and awards made, by scientific and\r\nmedical societies, but, with one exception, the so-called proofs of\r\ndeath for which the awards have been given are deemed unsatisfactory.\r\nThe most notable of the prizes is that of the Marquis d’Ourches,\r\nwho by his will bequeathed the sum of twenty thousand francs to be\r\ngiven to the author of the discovery of a simple and common means of\r\nrecognising beyond doubt the absolute signs of death, by such a test\r\nas could be adopted by poor villagers without technical instruction.\r\nThe Marquis d’Ourches left also a prize of five thousand francs for\r\na similar discovery, but requiring the intervention of an expert. M.\r\nPierre Manni, Professor at the University of Rome, offered a prize,\r\nwhich was awarded to Dr. E. Bouchut, in 1846. And M. Dusgate, by will,\r\ndated January 11, 1872, bequeathed to the French Academy of Sciences\r\na sufficient sum in French _Rentes_, to found a quinquennial prize of\r\ntwo thousand five hundred francs to the author of the best work on\r\nthe diagnostic signs of death, and the means of preventing premature\r\ninterments. A decree of November 27, 1874, authorised the Academy to\r\naccept this legacy.\r\n\r\nDr. Gowers, on “Diseases of the Nervous System,” vol. ii., p. 1037,\r\nsays:--“In cases of ‘death-trance,’ in which no sign of vitality can be\r\nrecognised, the presence of life may be ascertained (1) by the absence\r\nof any sign of decomposition; (2) by the normal appearance of the\r\n_fundus oculi_ as seen with the ophthalmoscope; (3) by the persistence\r\nof the excitability of the muscles to electricity. This excitability\r\ndisappears in three hours after actual death. In a case observed by\r\nRosenthal, thirty hours after supposed death, the muscles were still\r\nexcitable, and the patient awoke.”\r\n\r\nThe _British Medical Journal_, January 21, 1893, p. 145, reports,\r\nthrough its Paris correspondent, the first award. “The Académie des\r\nSciences proposed as the subject for the Dusgate Prize for 1890, ‘The\r\nSigns of Death, and the Means of Preventing Premature Burial.’ The\r\nprize has been awarded to Dr. Maze, who considers that putrefaction is\r\nthe only certain sign. He urges that the deaths should be certified\r\nby medical men on oath; also that in every cemetery there should be a\r\nmortuary where dead bodies can be deposited, and that burial should\r\ntake place only when putrefactive changes set in. Cremation should be\r\nadopted.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCREMATION AS A PREVENTIVE OF PREMATURE BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[SUGGESTIONS FOR PREVENTION.]\r\n\r\n[SIR HENRY THOMPSON’S OPINION.]\r\n\r\nAMONGST the numerous suggestions made by correspondents in the press\r\nwith a view of preventing live sepulture, none has been more frequently\r\nput forward than that of cremation. Sir Henry Thompson, the president\r\nof the Cremation Society of England, in the second edition of his\r\nadmirable volume, “Modern Cremation: Its History and Practice,” p. 41,\r\nobserves:--“There is a source of very painful dread--as I have reason\r\nto know--little talked of, it is true, but keenly felt by many persons\r\nat some time or another, the horror of which to some is inexpressible.\r\nIt is the dread of a premature burial--the fear lest some deep trance\r\nshould be mistaken for death, and that the awakening should take\r\nplace too late. Happily such occurrences must be exceedingly rare,\r\nespecially in this country, where the interval between death and\r\nburial is considerable, and the fear is almost a groundless one.\r\nStill, the conviction that such a fate is possible--which cannot\r\nbe altogether denied--will always be a source of severe trial to\r\nsome. With cremation no such catastrophe could ever occur; and the\r\ncompleteness of a properly-conducted process would render death\r\ninstantaneous and painless if by any unhappy chance an individual\r\nso circumstanced were submitted to it. But the guarantee against\r\nthis danger would be doubled, since inspection of the entire body\r\nmust of necessity immediately precede the act of cremation, no such\r\ninspection being possible under the present system.” While agreeing\r\nwith this distinguished authority as to the advantages of cremation\r\nfrom the sanitary and æsthetic point of view, which he dwells upon\r\nin the treatise referred to, and admitting that a certain amount of\r\nprotection against live burial is obtainable by means of the dual\r\nmedical inspection, we cannot agree that this protection is absolute.\r\nCases of trance are on record where some half a dozen doctors, after\r\ncareful examinations, have pronounced a cataleptic patient to be dead,\r\nand the patient, in defiance of their united opinion, has recovered\r\nconsciousness, and been restored to health.\r\n\r\nDr. Franz Hartmann, in his “Premature Burial,” quotes the two following\r\ncases amongst many others:--\r\n\r\n “Madame de P----, aged eighteen years, and subject to hysteria,\r\n apparently died, and for forty hours she presented all the signs of\r\n real death. All possible means of restoring her to life were taken,\r\n but proved of no avail. _Five physicians of Lyons were called in, and\r\n they finally agreed, positively, that the lady was really dead._ The\r\n funeral preparations were made; but owing to the supplications of a\r\n sister of the deceased the burial was delayed, when after a while the\r\n patient recovered. She said that she had been all the time aware of\r\n all that was going on, without being able to give a sign, and without\r\n even being desirous of attempting it.” (F. Kempner, p. 38.)\r\n\r\n “In 1842 a remarkable affair occupied the attention of the court\r\n at the city of Nantes. A man apparently died, and _his death was\r\n certified to both by the attending physicians and the medical\r\n inspector_; he was put into a coffin, and the religious ceremonies\r\n were performed in good style. At the end of the funeral service, and\r\n as he was about to be buried, he awoke from his trance. The clergy and\r\n the undertakers sent in their accounts for the funeral expenses; but\r\n he refused to pay them, giving as his reason that he had not ordered\r\n them; whereupon he was sued for the money.” (F. Kempner, p. 39.)\r\n\r\nNeither can we share the optimistic views of Sir Henry Thompson as\r\nto the rarity of premature interment. The results of searching and\r\nindependent inquiries and study in various countries by each of the\r\nauthors of this treatise all point the other way, and the various\r\nauthorities whose names and opinions are cited elsewhere in this\r\nvolume confess their astonishment at the number of cases brought to\r\nlight during their investigations. The Rev. H. R. Haweis also, in his\r\nwork “Ashes to Ashes: A Cremation Prelude” (London, 1895, now out\r\nof print), advocates cremation on the ground of preventing living\r\nburial, and quotes several cases of persons buried while in a state of\r\ntrance. During a discussion on the merits and demerits of cremation\r\nin the _Birmingham Gazette_, September 17, 1895, Lieutenant-General\r\nPhelps, an able and judicious observer, advocated cremation for similar\r\nreasons, and said that “the use of a crematorium would entirely prevent\r\nthat ghastly accident, the burial of the living. There is no room to\r\ndoubt that this frightful catastrophe is of continual occurrence. The\r\nphenomena of trance are little understood, and a certificate of death\r\nis held by most of us to justify the burial of the ‘corpse,’ dead or\r\nalive. Those of us who object to the risk of being buried alive should\r\ndo all in our power to promote the success of this sanitary contrivance\r\nfor disposing of our dead.”\r\n\r\nThe writer of the following communication, which appeared in the\r\n_Sunday Times_, September 6, 1896, has substantial reasons for\r\npreferring cremation to the risks of burial:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “BURIAL DANGER AND ITS PREVENTION.\r\n\r\n[COMMUNICATION TO THE “SUNDAY TIMES.”]\r\n\r\n “Madam,--When I was about five years old, my paternal home was one\r\n day plunged into a state of great consternation, through the sudden\r\n apparent death of my father, who had been sitting up during a part\r\n of the previous night occupied with some literary work, without a\r\n fire (it was in January), which brought on a death-like numbness,\r\n in which he was found the next morning. The family doctor, who was\r\n sent for at once, declared life to be extinct, but said he could not\r\n tell the cause of death until after the opening of the dead body.\r\n My mother, however, who did not see any reason why a young man of\r\n thirty-six should have died without any previous illness, caused the\r\n body of my father to be rubbed for about two hours, which renewed its\r\n circulation and brought it to life again. My father lived thirty-two\r\n years after that memorable day. Without the prudence of my mother,\r\n he would either have been dissected or buried alive. About twenty\r\n years after that occurrence, I visited the cemetery of Père La Chaise\r\n (Paris), accompanied by some friends. While inspecting the monuments\r\n of some musical celebrities we heard a noise from another part of the\r\n cemetery, whereto we proceeded without delay. When we had arrived\r\n there we found a strong body of policemen surrounding an open grave.\r\n But in answer to our inquiring ‘what had happened,’ we were simply\r\n requested to leave the cemetery at once, which, of course, we had to\r\n do. Neither the _portier_ nor any other person connected with the\r\n burial-ground would give any satisfactory answer to our questions.\r\n We left puzzled. But a week after, a young lady, who had been of our\r\n party the week before, went again to the Père La Chaise, determined\r\n to penetrate the mystery, in which endeavour she succeeded, partly\r\n through persuasion and partly through the gift of a twenty-franc piece\r\n to a grave-digger, who then told her the following story:--A poor\r\n young man of twenty-one years had been buried on the day of our visit.\r\n When the mourners had left the cemetery the grave-digger, who was\r\n occupied in filling up the grave, heard some noise coming from below.\r\n He hastened to the superintendent of the cemetery, imploring him\r\n to have the coffin opened, which, however, the superintendent could\r\n not do without the permission and the presence of the Commissaire de\r\n Police of that district. When the Commissaire appeared at last with\r\n his men, all was silent in the grave. But he had the coffin opened,\r\n nevertheless, ‘to appease the mind of that poor grave-digger,’ as\r\n he mockingly said. But great was the horror of the Commissaire de\r\n Police and his followers when the coffin was opened. The unfortunate\r\n young man (who was now quite dead) had been buried alive, recovered\r\n consciousness in his grave, scratched his face, bitten off the tips of\r\n his fingers, and turned around in his coffin, until suffocation put an\r\n end to his sufferings, which, if not long, must have been terrible.\r\n The Parisian newspapers did not mention the case. They were probably\r\n forbidden by the French Government to do so. But would it not have\r\n been wiser to let the whole world know of it, and thereby prevent\r\n repetitions of such dreadful occurrences? A similar case of live\r\n sepulture occurred in a village near Wiesbaden some thirty years ago,\r\n where a girl of sixteen was found with the same signs of suffocation\r\n in her coffin as those of that unfortunate young man in Paris. We are\r\n assured by a German authority that thousands of people are buried\r\n alive every year. But why should this be the case? If people must be\r\n buried before they begin to show signs of putrefaction (which seems\r\n to be the only reliable proof that life is really extinct), why not\r\n shorten their sufferings, in case of resuscitation, by opening an\r\n artery before they are buried? There is still much prejudice against\r\n the cremation of dead bodies, although two great facts are decidedly\r\n in its favour--viz., the impossibility of recovering consciousness\r\n when once inserted in the crematory oven, and the prevention of\r\n the unhealthiness which the slow process of putrefaction must\r\n entail.--Yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n  “J. H. BONAWITZ.\r\n\r\n “London.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Alexander Wilder, M.D., in his “Perils of Premature Burial,”\r\n1895, p. 16, says:--“I have often wished that the old Oriental practice\r\nof cremation was in fashion among us. There would then be at least\r\nthe comfortable reflection of no liability to suffocation in a coffin.\r\nThe application of fire, however, will generally rouse the cataleptic\r\nperson to some manifestation of life.”\r\n\r\n[CREMATION SOCIETY OF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the importance of the subject the author wrote to the\r\nhon. secretary of the Cremation Society of England, and received the\r\nfollowing reply, dated 8 New Cavendish Street, London, W.:--\r\n\r\n “With reference to your inquiry as to the steps adopted to prevent a\r\n person in a trance being cremated, I may say that this society has not\r\n made any special provision in that respect. You will notice, however,\r\n that before a cremation can be carried out, the cause of death must be\r\n certified without the slightest shadow of doubt by two duly qualified\r\n medical men. This being so, I think there is less likelihood of a\r\n person who is simply in a trance being cremated than buried, one\r\n doctor’s certificate being sufficient in the latter case.\r\n\r\n  “(Signed)      T. C. SWINBURNE-HANHAM.”\r\n\r\nIn the present state of medical knowledge on an occult subject not\r\nusually taught in the medical schools, and regarding phenomena as to\r\nwhich a large number of medical men are sceptical, to say the least,\r\nwe fail to see how the fact of death, in the absence of putrefaction,\r\ncan be certified “beyond the slightest shadow of doubt.” Many of the\r\ncases cited in this volume are those regarding which the examining\r\nmedical practitioners have been most sure. The Rev. John Page Hopps, in\r\n_Light_, July 4, 1896, says:--\r\n\r\n “We are told that respect for the dead urges to burial as against\r\n cremation, but many are now very keenly feeling the reverse of this.\r\n They can bring the mind to bear the liberation of the body by one\r\n swift act of disintegration and purifying, but cannot overcome the\r\n shrinking from subjecting it to the foul and lingering processes of\r\n the grave--or, perchance, to the horror of recovering consciousness in\r\n the grave.”\r\n\r\nWe take the occasion, however, to express on general grounds our\r\ncordial adherence to the cremation movement. Mr. Hopps further states\r\none of the strongest arguments thus:--\r\n\r\n “Respect for the living, too, is an urgent motive. The highest\r\n authorities tell us that the air we breathe and the water we drink are\r\n often contaminated by the emanations of graves. It cannot be right\r\n that London, for instance, with all its inevitable impurities, should\r\n add to its foulnesses that of trying to live in company with thousands\r\n upon thousands of decaying bodies in its very midst.”\r\n\r\nTo dispose of the dead decently, and at the same time without injury to\r\nthe living, is one of the first obligations of civilised communities,\r\nand cremation seems best calculated to fulfil the conditions. Zymotic\r\ndiseases, such as typhus, scarlatina, and the plague, have been traced\r\nin certain instances to emanations from burial-grounds.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Creighton, in his “History of Epidemics in Britain,” vol.\r\ni., p. 336, says:--“The grand provocative of plague was no obvious\r\nnuisance above ground, but the loading of the soil, generation after\r\ngeneration, with an immense quantity of cadaveric matters, which were\r\ndiffused in the pores of the ground under the feet of the living, to\r\nrise in emanations more deadly in one season than in another.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem from these experiences as though there was quite as much\r\ntruth as poetry in Shakespeare when he said, “Grave-yards yawn, and\r\nhell itself breathes out contagion on the world.” Before many years it\r\nis not unlikely that cremation in this as in some other countries will\r\nbe made obligatory in cases of death from all infectious diseases. As\r\nthe late Bishop of Manchester observed, “The earth is not for the dead,\r\nbut for the living.” During the thirteen years ending 1890 there were\r\nthree hundred and three thousand four hundred and sixty-six deaths from\r\ncholera in Japan, and all the bodies of these persons were cremated. In\r\nIndia, as we have already shown, cremation is practised under most of\r\nthe religious systems, as it is believed that the soul is not free from\r\nits earthly tenement until the body is reduced to ashes. The method of\r\nburning is slow and cumbersome as compared with that adopted in Europe;\r\nbut during the author’s last visit to Ceylon, in the early part of the\r\npresent year (1896), there was some talk of establishing a crematorium.\r\n\r\n[THE LONDON BURIAL-GROUNDS.]\r\n\r\nIn “The London Burial-Grounds,” by Mrs. Basil Holmes, 1896, p. 269, the\r\nquestion is asked:--“Are we ever to allow England to be divided like a\r\nchess-board into towns and burial-places? What we have to consider is\r\nhow to dispose of the dead without taking so much valuable space from\r\nthe living. In the metropolitan area alone we have almost filled (and\r\nin some places over-filled) twenty-four new cemeteries within sixty\r\nyears, with an area of above six hundred acres; and this is as nothing\r\ncompared with the huge extent of land used for interments just outside\r\nthe limits of the metropolis. If the cemeteries are not to extend\r\nindefinitely they must in time be built upon, or they must be used for\r\nburial over and over again, or the ground must revert to its original\r\nstate as agricultural land, or we must turn our parks and commons into\r\ncemeteries, and let our cemeteries be our only recreation grounds,\r\nwhich heaven forbid!”\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Ebenezer Duncan eight thousand bodies are buried\r\nyearly in Glasgow and its neighbourhood, poisoning both air and water,\r\nand endangering the public health. The same state of things has existed\r\nin London, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, and other large towns.\r\nThe following resolution was unanimously adopted in the Preventive\r\nMedicine Department of a Health Congress, Glasgow, in July, 1896:--\r\n\r\n “That in the opinion of this Congress cremation of the dead,\r\n especially in cases of infectious disease, is a natural and very\r\n desirable hygienic process, and that this Congress of the British\r\n Institute of Public Health use all proper means to urge upon the\r\n Government the desirability of their promoting a measure to enable\r\n sanitary authorities, if they so desire, to build crematoria and to\r\n conduct them under proper superintendence.”\r\n\r\nIt must be allowed, however, that cremation, in spite of its obvious\r\nadvantages, is not one of those movements which advance by leaps and\r\nbounds. The recent annual report of the Cremation Society of England\r\nstates that during the last year there were two hundred and eight\r\ncremations in the United Kingdom--viz., one hundred and fifty at\r\nWoking, and fifty-eight at Manchester. Crematoria have recently been\r\nestablished at Glasgow and Liverpool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nWAITING MORTUARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF all the various methods that have been suggested or introduced for\r\nthe prevention of premature interment, none has been attended with such\r\nsatisfactory results as the erection of mortuaries (Leichenhäuser) in\r\nGermany. These structures, described in pp. 294 _et seq._, ought to\r\nbe provided, as far as practicable, in every parish, and certainly\r\nin every Sanitary District in the United Kingdom, and by the Boards\r\nof Health in the United States, and adapted to the requirements of\r\nthe population. They should be of chaste and elegant design, well\r\nventilated; their atmosphere made antiseptic with living plants and\r\nflowers, and by plenty of light; provided with baths and couches, and\r\na skilled attendant--edifices where both the dead and the apparent\r\ndead can be deposited pending burial, cremation, or resuscitation.\r\nSeparate compartments are necessary for cases where death has been due\r\nto accidents and for those who have succumbed to infectious diseases.\r\nEvery modern appliance should be introduced for the restoration of\r\nsuch as may exhibit signs of returning consciousness, and of those in\r\nwhom, after sufficient time had elapsed, no sign of putrefaction was\r\nobservable. The temperature of the room should be kept at eighty-four\r\ndegrees, as suggested by Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson, and no\r\ninterment, cremation, _post-mortem_, or embalming should be permitted\r\nuntil a medical examination by one or more experienced physicians\r\nshowed unequivocal signs of putrefaction. Perhaps the Royal Humane\r\nSociety, which during the last one hundred and fifty years has done\r\nsuch splendid work in restoring the drowned and asphyxiated, might\r\nbe willing to extend the field of its benevolent operations to other\r\nneglected forms of suspended animation where intelligent direction and\r\nsupervision is so much required.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review_, 1855,\r\nvol. xv., p. 75, says:--“The earliest movements in the direction of\r\nmeans for the prevention of premature interments originated with\r\nWinslow in France, followed by other well-known writers upon the signs\r\nof death. It was Madame Necker, however, who embodied their suggestions\r\nin a practicable form as submitted to the National Assembly, in\r\n1792, by Count Berchshold. In the ninth year of the first French\r\nRepublic (1801) a project was entertained for the erection of six\r\n‘temples funeraires’ in Paris, but came to no good, as attendant evils\r\npreponderated. To Germany belongs the credit of having executed these\r\ndesigns in such wise that they should not prove the positive sources\r\nof more danger to the living than could be counter-balanced by the\r\noccasional preservation of an individual from the risk of premature\r\ninterment. Believing that this risk had been prodigiously diminished\r\nsince the establishment of these institutions for the reception of\r\ncases where doubt of the reality of death has existed, Hufeland, in\r\nWeimar, devised the plan that Frankfort-on-the-Maine incorporated\r\nwith its reform in sepulture and establishment of extra-mural\r\ncemeteries, in 1823. Hufeland’s plans have subsequently been adopted\r\nand carried out in many other German States.... As a sanitary measure\r\nthe separation of the dead from the living, especially from among\r\nthe crowded poor, would be, apart from the not less important point\r\nof verification of death, an incalculable benefit.... It behoves us\r\nin this matter to learn another lesson from our neighbours, and to\r\ntake measures to prevent the occurrence of catastrophes too fearfully\r\nhorrible to contemplate in thought, too dreadful for the most vivid\r\nimagination to realise. Science can hold out no token by which to\r\nrecognise the certainty of death. Sanitary police, at least in England,\r\nis indifferent about the risk of a few burials alive, and thinks it\r\nsuperfluous to prevent their occurrence.”\r\n\r\n[THE GERMAN SYSTEM.]\r\n\r\nThat the people have a right to protection by the State against\r\npreventable sources of danger, all civilised nations have acknowledged,\r\nby the making of laws that guard their citizens from the invasion of\r\ndiseases of domestic or foreign origin, as well as many other perils.\r\nBut the German-speaking countries have gone further than any other\r\nin this humane direction _by recognising apparent death as a special\r\nperil to be guarded against by law_, in order to prevent living\r\nburials. For this purpose they have established mortuaries connected\r\nwith cemeteries, in which the apparently dead are placed, under the\r\nobservation of physicians and attendants. Here the bodies are placed\r\nupon tables, dressed in their ordinary clothes, amidst light, warmth,\r\nand ventilation, surrounded by plants and floral tributes. Thus they\r\nare kept from forty-eight to seventy-two hours, unless decomposition\r\nsets in earlier, or the death was due to an infectious disease. Further\r\ndelay is allowed on application by the attending physician, or by some\r\nmember of the family interested. Cords connected with an alarm bell are\r\nattached to the fingers, under the conviction that the least movement\r\nof the body would arouse the attendant in an adjoining room. No doubt\r\nthese mortuaries have saved a certain number from being buried alive;\r\nbut the system can be improved by extending the observation until\r\nsuch time as death is certain, for experience shows that no stated\r\nlimit of time can apply to all cases of trance and catalepsy, which\r\nare the chief causes of apparent death. Some of these continue for\r\na week, and cases of even longer duration are not unknown. It often\r\nhappens that returning vital activity consists merely in scarcely\r\nperceptible movements of the eyelids or the mouth, a change of the\r\ncomplexion, slight moisture on the face, or a faint action of the\r\nheart, or a warmth in that region, or feeble thoracic movements--all\r\nof which might escape observation until the allotted time had expired,\r\nand no contrivance, however delicately adjusted, could announce their\r\npresence. Time alone will test the existence of life or death in such\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe extensive literature on this subject shows that the struggle to\r\nbring about the existing mortuary system in Germany was kept up for\r\nmany years before it obtained its measure of success. It was legalised\r\nabout the year 1795, after the physicians of Germany, France, and\r\nAustria had shown the absolute necessity for it.\r\n\r\nMortuaries have continued in high favour with the people wherever they\r\nhave once been properly established; none, so far as the author has\r\nbeen able to learn, have ever been abolished. At the present time the\r\ncity of Munich is constructing a mortuary at the Southern cemetery upon\r\na costly scale, surpassing in sumptuous accessories anything of the\r\nkind before attempted in Germany. It will be not unworthy of the public\r\nbuildings of the city. This is an emphatic endorsement of the necessity\r\nof the system by a people that for more than fifty years has given it a\r\nthorough trial; and it is a strong argument for its adoption elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe question suggests itself here: Why should not the English-speaking\r\npeoples accept the long experience of a philosophical, painstaking,\r\nclear-minded people like the Germans, supported as it is by many\r\nsanitary and medical authorities in France, England, and the United\r\nStates, and establish these institutions in connection with existing\r\ncemeteries, with such modifications as national habits, local tastes,\r\nand customs may dictate?\r\n\r\nThe following practical suggestions are from a paper in the _Medical\r\nTimes_, vol. xvi., No. 415, p. 574, September 11, 1847, entitled, “On\r\nthe construction of houses for the reception of the dead; and on the\r\nmeans to be used for the recovery of those who are only in trances or\r\nfits, or in whom life is only impassive,” by Robert Brandon, Esq.,\r\nGreat Russell Street, Bloomsbury:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “_DUBIÆ VITÆ REFUGIUM_; OR, ASYLUM FOR DOUBTFUL LIFE.\r\n\r\n [ASYLUM FOR DOUBTFUL LIFE.]\r\n\r\n “The building should be large enough to provide means for\r\n resuscitation, and have room enough for the deposition of bodies\r\n when epidemics are prevalent. There should be hot baths, for these\r\n often are alone enough to recall the vital spark; and a kitchen to\r\n prepare nourishment for those who are recovered, and for the porter\r\n and other officers who would live on the building. The room for the\r\n deposit of the bodies should communicate with the porter’s room by\r\n means of a glass door, and every body should have a wire fixed to\r\n the feet and hands, in communication with a bell, which bell must\r\n ring in the porter’s room, in order to warn him should there be any\r\n motion in those thought to be dead. There should be men and women on\r\n the premises to use friction, a galvanic machine, and the implements\r\n necessary for transfusion and artificial respiration. As the usual\r\n and accepted signs of death are not signs to be relied on, so is\r\n decomposition a true sign, and none should be buried until this be\r\n present; but as the presence of decomposed animal matter would be\r\n injurious, not only to the inmates of houses, but to the surrounding\r\n inhabitants, and as it is inconvenient to the poor man who has but one\r\n room to keep a body in that room, where he and his family eat, drink,\r\n and sleep, asylums for the reception of those thought to be dead\r\n should be constructed, and are absolutely necessary. Nor is it enough\r\n to wait for decomposition, but we should endeavour to prevent this\r\n by endeavouring to restore vitality by means of hot baths, external\r\n heat, artificial respiration, galvanism, or transfusion; the first of\r\n these is oftentimes enough. Now, I think it probable that many persons\r\n would be recovered, thought to be dead, for, out of a number of those\r\n reputed dead, a certain number have recovered--some by the sticking of\r\n the pins into them which fixed the shrouds, some under the surgeon’s\r\n knife, some from delays in the burial, and others from the accidental\r\n overturning of the coffins, as we learn from a paper published on\r\n premature burials. Some time since a woman was kept above ground for\r\n a considerable time, as medical men could not decide if she were dead\r\n or no. And at Constantinople a sailor the other day was attacked with\r\n apoplexy, and a vein was opened in his arm; no blood came, and the\r\n man was thought to be dead, but on the road to the grave blood began\r\n to flow, and the supposed dead man recovered. There is now living in\r\n Brussels a man who escaped from the grave; and another built a house\r\n at Cologne to commemorate his escape. These cases will be enough to\r\n show that we have no certain sign of death but decomposition; and,\r\n if this be true, we must have asylums for the reception of bodies\r\n previous to decomposition, and for the application of means which can\r\n do no harm, and may do much good, such as those before indicated.\r\n Medical men think that the absence of respiration and want of heart’s\r\n action, with loss of motion and sensation, are signs of death; but\r\n this is not the case, for many bodies which have been drowned have all\r\n these signs present and yet recover. Again, infants are often born\r\n without any action of the heart or lungs, and yet are recovered by\r\n very simple means, such as the hot bath; and I myself have recovered\r\n persons by stimulants who were thought to be dead. Many may be\r\n recovered by transfusion (first introduced into this country by the\r\n celebrated Dr. Blundel) when the heart still palpitates, but the\r\n brain is insensible; or by stimulants given at that period; or by\r\n hot bath, and the external application of heat; by galvanism, where\r\n other means have failed; and these can do no harm. Since the brain\r\n is insensible there can be no suffering; and many lives will be saved\r\n by perseverance, and the skilful application of means which have\r\n succeeded in isolated cases. Buildings for the reception of those\r\n thought to be dead should be placed in cemeteries.\r\n\r\n “I divide life into active and passive. Life is active when man is\r\n in the enjoyment of all his faculties, intellectual and moral; when\r\n the various organs necessary for circulation and respiration are in\r\n play; when there is sensation, perception, and motion; and when the\r\n sphincters are not relaxed. Passive life is that state hitherto called\r\n death; but, according to me, death is decomposition.\r\n\r\n “Nor should we despair at any period previous to this, since we\r\n can give motion by galvanism; blood by transfusion; respiration by\r\n artificial respiration; heat by this and the external application\r\n of caloric; and by stimulants we can keep up that action which has\r\n been excited by other means. Nor must we despair if we do not at once\r\n succeed in our endeavours to recall life, for perseverance often\r\n accomplishes that which at first sight seems impossible.\r\n\r\n [MR. ROBERT BRANDON’S SUGGESTIONS.]\r\n\r\n “Men have recovered from simulated death after being in the sea twenty\r\n minutes, and I see no reason why, after disease, men may not also be\r\n recovered from a state resembling death. Many who are left as dead\r\n are only in fainting fits, some are in trances; and graves have been\r\n opened where the buried man has been found to have eaten portions of\r\n his own flesh, which of course he could not have done unless recovery\r\n had taken place. How horrible to think that we may awake up in our\r\n graves tormented with the pangs of hunger, unable scarce to breathe,\r\n and finding all escape from our narrow cell impossible; the prisoner\r\n in his grave has nought to do but to commend his soul afresh to his\r\n Maker, and lay himself down to die! May not much of this be prevented\r\n by asylums for doubtful life, by the application of reagents, and by\r\n building vaults in our cemeteries instead of graves? I earnestly hope\r\n that the day has arrived when we see these things in the proper light;\r\n when our church-yards will be no longer overloaded with the remains\r\n of those who, perhaps, might have lived had they been left a little\r\n longer above ground--had they been transfused, or even buried in\r\n vaults instead of graves, with a guardian to watch over their mortal\r\n remains! Life may exist, but not be evident; but the non-evidence\r\n of life is no proof of death, as many have been recovered in whom\r\n life was only latent--in whom there was no action of the heart,\r\n no respiration, no motion, no sensation. This has happened after\r\n drowning, in infants born asphyxiated, in women after flooding, and\r\n would happen much more often were the proper means applied in all\r\n cases to recall life, and to ascertain those who may be recoverable.\r\n Simple inspection is not enough to decide if a man be dead or not,\r\n because persons are often only in trances or fainting fits when they\r\n are thought to be dead; and I wish to insist on the fact that there is\r\n no sign of death but decomposition, and that, therefore, none should\r\n be buried until this sign be present, nor until an attestation of the\r\n presence of decomposition be given by some surgeon.”\r\n\r\nReferring to the universal fear of burying relatives alive, the\r\n_Lancet_, September 20, 1845, vol. ii., p. 321, observed:--“It is\r\nbut little use to descant upon an evil without pointing out a remedy.\r\nIn Frankfort, Munich, and in various other towns, houses, properly\r\nsituated, have been fitted up for the temporary reception of the\r\ndead. Corpses are there deposited immediately after death, and taken\r\ncare of until the signs of decomposition have become unequivocal,\r\nmedical assistance being at hand should symptoms of vitality manifest\r\nthemselves. By this simple plan all the objections which attend on the\r\nretention of the dead in the dwellings of the poor may be obviated, and\r\nat the same time their dread of burying their relatives whilst still\r\nalive respected. This plan is evidently much preferable to that which\r\nis followed in France. In the latter country, in the large towns, there\r\nis in every district a medical inspector of the dead. The inspector\r\nis informed of the death as soon as it has taken place, and within\r\na very limited time is bound to inspect the body and give a formal\r\ncertificate. This guarantee having been obtained, the inhumation of\r\nthe deceased is enforced by law within two or three days of the death.\r\nNotwithstanding this precaution, cases have occurred, even during the\r\nlast few years, which appear to prove that inhumation has taken place\r\nbefore life was quite extinct. We doubt, also, whether such early\r\ninterment could under any circumstances be enforced in our own country.\r\nSome modification of the German plan is evidently what we must look\r\nfor in any system of legislation which may hereafter be decided on.”\r\nThese admirable suggestions from the leading medical journal were made\r\nmore than half a century ago; since that time, every year has brought\r\nto light cases of living burial, and confirmed the urgent need of\r\nreform; but nothing has been done until quite recently to awaken public\r\nattention to their importance. The subject is of such a gruesome,\r\nunpleasant, and depressing character that few people care to have\r\ntheir names associated with a movement of this character, beneficent\r\nthough it is, and certain to save thousands of unfortunate people,\r\nparticularly women and children (who are more especially liable to\r\nvarious forms of suspended animation), from such tragic occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe _Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal_, August 22, 1895,\r\nreferring to the fact that in 1892 thirty-one thousand eight hundred\r\nand ninety-two inquests were held in England, and to the urgent\r\nnecessity for the erection of mortuaries, says:--\r\n\r\n[EVERYWHERE NEEDED.]\r\n\r\n “The bountiful, or private enterprise, should provide these\r\n mortuaries. But once let their necessity be recognised and the scheme\r\n approved,--fashion leading the way,--then undertakers would readily\r\n supply what was wanted. If not, then the local authority should take\r\n the initiative. Mortuaries are sadly needed almost everywhere for\r\n present purposes, as newspapers constantly affirm. In providing them,\r\n care should be taken to build with an eye to future requirements when\r\n it shall become customary if not compulsory to remove the dead from\r\n among the living within a reasonable time after death.\r\n\r\n “It is merciful sometimes to be inexorable, and what a lot of willing\r\n and unnecessary discomfort and risk would be saved were it possible\r\n and the practice to find a temporary resting-place for our departed\r\n friends till we are ready to carry them befittingly to the tomb.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMORTUARIES OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nEach of the sanitary districts in the Metropolis is supposed to have\r\na mortuary of some kind for the reception of bodies from hospitals,\r\ninfirmaries, hotels, private houses, as well as from the river and\r\nstreets, or in transit to and from foreign countries, where they are\r\nkept without charge for about five days, unless the public health\r\nrequires earlier interment. Hospitals, hotels, and families are\r\nthus relieved of the presence of corpses, for convenience, and for\r\npurposes of inquest. The mortuaries are nearly all plain, gloomy, and\r\ndepressing structures of brick. The best of them comprise a coroner’s\r\ncourtroom, coroner’s private room, the caretaker’s rooms, waiting\r\nroom, _post-mortem_ room, chapel, and viewing room connected. There is\r\nno physician in attendance, and no autopsies are performed except by\r\nsurgeons upon their own cases, or for purposes of inquests. There are\r\nno appliances or conveniences for resuscitation, as all the bodies are\r\nregarded as dead, having been, for the most part, certified as such by\r\na medical practitioner, the exceptions being such as are taken from the\r\nwater or street by the police, or left there for inquest. The buildings\r\nare usually well lighted, and some of the rooms contain fire-places,\r\nbut they are devoid of taste or ornamentation of any kind. The bodies\r\nare kept in coffins, which, if there is any odour proceeding from them,\r\nare screwed down. Permission is afforded for inspection by doctors or\r\nby any of the family of the deceased on application to the keeper.\r\nThese mortuaries are kept clean, and decent and respectful treatment of\r\nthe bodies is enforced by regulations.\r\n\r\n[THE LONDON MORTUARIES.]\r\n\r\nThe London County Council issued a return (No. 157) dated March 9,\r\n1894, in pursuance of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to\r\ncoroners’ courts, mortuaries, etc., from which it appears that there\r\nwere fifty-one mortuaries in the sanitary districts of London up to\r\nSeptember 30, 1893. In most of these the accommodation is described\r\nas “sufficient,” “good,” “well arranged,” “excellent,” “convenient.”\r\nOthers are of an opposite character. The one attached to the Town\r\nHall, Holborn district, is reported as “very small (about nine feet by\r\nnine feet), inconvenient, and badly situated.” In the Poplar district\r\nthe mortuary “is an old crypt, quite unfit for the purpose, and has\r\nno convenience for _post-mortems_.” At Ratcliffe, in the Limehouse\r\ndistrict, the mortuary “consists of a railway arch, and is very\r\nunsuitable.” “There is a very small mortuary in the church-yard” at\r\nShadwell. The mortuary under the church-yard of St. Martin’s Church\r\n(St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields) is reported “very imperfect.” The one in\r\nthe Southern Coroner’s district is situated under a railway arch, and\r\nthere is no mortuary-keeper. At St. Paul’s, Deptford, the mortuary\r\ncontains only one room, which serves for mortuary and _post-mortem_\r\nroom. Plumstead is possessed of an underground mortuary in the\r\nchurch-yard, reported as “unsatisfactory.” The Lewisham district\r\nhas an “unsuitable” mortuary at the cemetery. Rotherhithe has “an\r\ninadequate mortuary in the old burial-ground.” At St. George the\r\nMartyr (Southwark) the mortuary is reported to be “inadequate and\r\nunsuitable.” In the Strand district there is “no proper mortuary, but\r\na small dead-house attached to the Savoy Chapel is used.” Eltham,\r\nLea, and Kidbrooke, in the Plumstead district, have no mortuaries.\r\nThe part of Lambeth, S. and S.E., up the Clapham and Kennington Park\r\nroads, is without a mortuary, and _bodies awaiting inquest are kept in\r\nprivate houses_. Nor are there any mortuaries in the Greenwich district\r\n(Hatcham), Wapping, or Mile End Old Town. Arrangements are reported to\r\nbe in progress for the enlargement of some of these establishments and\r\nthe erection of others.\r\n\r\nNo resuscitations are reported from any of these places, except in\r\nthe case of Ernest Wicks, a boy two years old, who was found lying\r\non the grass in Regent’s Park apparently dead, and resuscitated in\r\nSt. Marylebone Mortuary (after being laid out on a slab as dead) in\r\nSeptember, 1895, by the keeper, Mr. Ellis, assisted by Mrs. Ellis.\r\nWhen the doctor arrived, the child was breathing freely, though still\r\ninsensible. The child was taken to the Middlesex Hospital, and was\r\nreported by the surgeon to be recovering from a fit.\r\n\r\n[HOSPITAL MORTUARIES.]\r\n\r\nThe London mortuaries stand well in the estimation of the authorities,\r\nmedical practitioners, and the people, on account of their usefulness\r\nand convenience in relieving hotels and private houses of the dead\r\npending funerals, and in cases of deaths from infectious diseases, as\r\nwell as from accidents and acts of violence (amongst which suicides are\r\nincluded) which require investigation. In consequence of this, there is\r\na disposition on the part of the authorities to enlarge and improve the\r\nolder and smaller ones, and to introduce the later conveniences. Those\r\nin St. Marylebone and St. Luke’s are the latest examples, and could,\r\nwith comparatively little outlay, be rendered creditable and useful\r\nestablishments. First of all, they require the means of resuscitation,\r\nsuch as are in use at the Royal Humane Societies’ Depôts, and at\r\nthe German mortuaries; also baths, couches, plants, flowers, and\r\nmural ornaments, with a skilled nurse or caretaker, and a medical\r\npractitioner either on the establishment or within telephone call. A\r\nfundamental regulation should be added to the standing orders that,\r\nwhen there is no sign of decomposition, bodies should be treated not\r\nas dead but as sick needing attention, and to be kept under careful\r\nobservation. Such simple and inexpensive alterations, gradually\r\nintroduced by County, Parish, and District Councils, would, in the\r\ncourse of time, bring about a greater respect for the dead, with proper\r\nconsideration for the apparently dead, besides increasing the feeling\r\nof the sanctity of human life. In the course of time these improvements\r\nwould educate the public, and lead to the erection of new and handsome\r\nstructures of beautiful design, with appropriate artistic decorations,\r\nsuch as are to be found in Munich and other parts of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe _Medical Times_, September 5, 1896, p. 569, says:--\r\n\r\n “In a recent issue of the _Nursing Record_, there is an interesting\r\n article on hospital mortuaries by a special commissioner.... At\r\n Guy’s the mortuary only contains room for one body. There is a bier,\r\n covered by a cradle and a red and white washing pall, and over this\r\n is a shelf, on which are placed a cross, fresh flowers, and candles.\r\n At St. Bartholomew’s the mortuary itself is certainly not a place\r\n where one would care to find one’s dead. The bare, white-washed\r\n walls, the sloping floor, the black lidless shells, covered by\r\n white sheets, would depress most people even if they had no special\r\n interest in them. That this is felt to some extent by the hospital\r\n authorities is evident from the fact that, when a member of the\r\n staff dies, they do their best to make other arrangements for the\r\n disposal of the body until it is removed from the hospital. There\r\n is an hospital not named [continues the _Medical Times_] where the\r\n only place available as a mortuary is the wash-house. It would appear\r\n that the managers of metropolitan hospitals do not believe in the\r\n reality of death-counterfeits, and therefore make no arrangements for\r\n resuscitation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMORTUARIES IN THE PROVINCES.\r\n\r\nWith the object of ascertaining the utility of these establishments,\r\nthe author wrote to the clerks or other officials in all the larger\r\ntowns in the United Kingdom, fifty in number, requesting copies of\r\nthe regulations, reports, etc. To these communications twenty-four\r\nreplies were received. Of these, only three sent copies of reports,\r\nfurnishing particulars of the number of bodies received, and the number\r\nof inquests and _post-mortems_; three sent copies of regulations;\r\nand the remainder do not publish either reports or regulations. One,\r\nhowever (Poplar), states that the by-laws in use are approved by the\r\nLocal Government Board. The Chief Constable at the Town Hall, Salford,\r\nwrites, July 26, 1896--“There are three mortuaries in the borough, but\r\na separate record of the bodies laid in the mortuaries is not kept, and\r\nno papers exist respecting them.” Mr. Hagger, the Vestry Clerk of the\r\nParish of Liverpool, says--“I know of no public mortuary in Liverpool\r\nwhich is considered to be of such importance as to call for anything\r\nin the shape of periodical reports.” Mr. R. Davidson, Governor of the\r\nCity Parish Poorhouse, Glasgow, writes, July 27, 1896--“I have never\r\nhad any reports relating to the mortuary here.” Mr. J. Jackson, Chief\r\nConstable, Sheffield, writes, July 29--“We have never had papers or\r\nreports connected with it (the mortuary), except the ordinary rules and\r\nregulations for preserving decency, cleanliness, etc.” Similar replies\r\nwere received from Manchester, Swansea, Scarborough, Wigan, Bristol,\r\nSt. Mary’s (Islington), Dundee, and Catford. Mr. Robert Clinton, Master\r\nof the Bethnal Green Workhouse, writes, July 30--“That their mortuary\r\nhas not been the subject of any reports,” and continues, “The subject\r\nof persons being buried alive is a very important one, and should\r\narouse the interest of every intelligent person. Some method ought\r\ncertainly to be devised that will prevent anyone being subjected to so\r\nhorrible a fate.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts are from the report by Dr. J. E. Kenny, M.P.,\r\nCoroner for the City of Dublin, received in January, 1894:--\r\n\r\n[BURIAL CUSTOMS IN IRELAND.]\r\n\r\n“There are no local laws in Dublin or in Ireland relative to the mode\r\nof disposal of the dead, but the Sanitary Acts, which refer to the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, can be availed of when\r\nnecessary to compel the burial of the dead within a reasonable period,\r\non the ground that an unburied body is a nuisance dangerous to public\r\nhealth. There is, however, no fixed period. Among Roman Catholics it\r\nis customary to bury the dead on the third or fourth day after death,\r\nbut there is no hard-and-fast rule.... The local burial authorities\r\nusually require a medical certificate of death before opening the\r\ngrave, but there is no legal sanction for this, and it is merely the\r\ncustom. The coroner’s order for burial where an inquest is held does\r\naway with the necessity of such certificates as those above referred\r\nto, but _post-mortem_ examinations in these cases are the exception,\r\nnot the rule. A good many, however, are held on those who die in\r\nlocal hospitals when the consent of the relatives or friends can\r\nbe obtained. I have not heard of any case of cremation in Ireland,\r\nand earth-burial is the universal practice. Occasionally, when so\r\nordered by the will of the deceased, a body is removed to England\r\nfor cremation. I am myself rather in favour of cremation as a more\r\nscientific and safer method of disposing of the dead.\r\n\r\n“There are no chambers (mortuaries) of the kind referred to in this\r\nquestion in Dublin, nor, so far as I know, in Ireland. I know of no\r\nlaw as to the signs of death which must be recognised to exist before\r\nburial is permitted, nor is there any officer on whom is thrown the\r\nduty of ascertaining or deciding whether such exist or not.\r\n\r\n[REFORMS URGENTLY NEEDED.]\r\n\r\n“If cremation be generally adopted, it ought not to be performed\r\nearlier than the third day after death, or perhaps not until some\r\nunmistakable sign of decomposition has set in. I think this rule of\r\nsome such sign of decomposition setting in ought to apply to all\r\nmethods of disposal of the dead. Whenever well-marked warmth of the\r\nbody exists after apparent death, burial of any kind ought not to take\r\nplace until after a full and exhaustive examination by a competent\r\nauthority. In all doubtful cases I would suggest the application of\r\neither a hot iron to some sensitive part of the body, or that a small\r\nincision should be made over the course of some small artery, a person\r\nbeing left to watch the result for some time in the latter case, so as\r\nto take proper precautions against hæmorrhage, should the person be not\r\nreally dead. It might perhaps with advantage be made the law that in\r\nevery case of death or supposed death the body should be viewed by a\r\nmedical man, who, having satisfied himself that death had taken place,\r\nwould sign a certificate to that effect. If I understand rightly, such\r\nis the law in France. I would, however, be opposed to any law making an\r\nautopsy necessary in every case. The existence of such a public officer\r\nas a coroner is undoubtedly of advantage in reference to cases of\r\nsudden death or supposed death, as it is among such cases that mistakes\r\nare most likely to occur. I can see no objection to the establishment,\r\nat the public expense, of chambers for the reception of dead bodies\r\nunder certain circumstances.”\r\n\r\nIn reply to a similar inquiry Sir Charles A. Cameron, Superintendent\r\nMedical Officer of Health, writes, August 10, 1896--“There is no public\r\nmortuary in Dublin, but we are taking steps for the establishment of\r\none.”\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that the mortuaries described in these reports\r\nhave little in common with certain _Leichenhäuser_ of Germany or\r\nthe _Mortuaires d’ Attente_ urgently called for by various writers\r\nof France, and proposed to be erected. The English mortuaries may\r\nmore appropriately be described as _morgues_ or depositories for\r\nthe homeless and neglected dead--useful for this purpose, but in no\r\nrespect fulfilling the requirements of the present day. Without skilful\r\nattendants and scientific appliances for the restoration of suspended\r\nlife, to which all are liable, the apparently dead, if deposited\r\nin such chilling establishments, would, through neglect, be more\r\nlikely to lose what spark of life remained than to have it kindled\r\ninto a flame and recover. The erection of mortuaries for the sake of\r\ndeath-counterfeits, and in order to give peace of mind to doubting\r\nfriends, would no doubt be opposed chiefly on the ground of expense.\r\nThe outlay must come from the pockets of the rate-payers, who have been\r\naccustomed to accept the cursory inspection of “the corpse” and the\r\ncertificate of the doctor as a satisfactory solution of any misgivings\r\nas to the actuality of death. Under the circumstances it would not\r\nbe surprising if the unreflecting majority preferred to take what\r\nthey would consider to be an infinitesimal risk rather than to incur\r\nthe expense of the necessary outlay. This volume has been written to\r\nremove such apathy, and, if possible, to arouse public attention to\r\nthe subject; and if the facts are, as the author believes, absolutely\r\ntrue, and the danger real, other and abler contributions furnishing\r\nthe results of wider and more extensive investigations may be expected\r\nto follow. It is believed that the expense of constructing tastefully\r\ndesigned mortuaries in all populous districts could be met by a rate of\r\nfrom a farthing to a penny in the pound, and in the smaller or thinly\r\npopulated districts groups of parishes could unite in providing such\r\nuseful institutions. At present, under existing customs, probably ten\r\ntimes the amount required is annually expended in funeral trappings,\r\nmourning habiliments, costly wreaths, and ornamental monuments (mainly\r\nfor the purpose of ostentatious display) than would provide temporary\r\nresting-places for the real and apparently dead in every part of the\r\nUnited Kingdom. The erection of such establishments, where the fact\r\nof death in every case could be unequivocally demonstrated before\r\nburial or cremation, would remove an ever present and consuming load of\r\nanxiety from the hearts of thousands of sensitive souls.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL MORTUARIES.\r\n\r\n[CONTINENTAL MORTUARIES.]\r\n\r\nThe author is indebted to a “Treatise on Public Health,” by Albert\r\nPalemberg and A. Newsholme, London, 1893, for the following details:--\r\n\r\n\r\n BRUSSELS.\r\n\r\n “This city possesses two mortuaries to which bodies are conveyed from\r\n confined houses. One of these, within the town, only receives the\r\n bodies of persons not having died of an infectious disease; all others\r\n are conveyed to the mortuary at the Evère Cemetery....\r\n\r\n “In times of epidemic the removal of corpses to the mortuary is\r\n compulsory, and so also in other cases where the medical health\r\n officer decides that it is necessary. No corpse, without special\r\n permission, can be kept in the mortuary more than forty-eight hours\r\n after death, but this interval can be shortened or lengthened by\r\n special order.”\r\n\r\n\r\n PARIS.\r\n\r\n “By a decision of July 21, 1890, the Municipal Council of Paris has\r\n decided to establish a mortuary in each of the cemeteries of the east\r\n (Père La Chaise) and the north (Montmartre).... The mortuaries are\r\n not available for the bodies of persons having died from infectious\r\n disease.\r\n\r\n “Bodies are only admitted to the mortuary--(1) On the written\r\n application of the head of the family or some other persons competent\r\n to undertake the funeral. (2) On the production of a certificate of\r\n death from the doctor who attended the patient, stating that the death\r\n was not caused by infectious disease.\r\n\r\n “Up to the present time (1893) these mortuaries do not appear to have\r\n been of great service, owing to the unwillingness of families to part\r\n with their dead before the time of interment.\r\n\r\n “‘La Morgue.’--This establishment only receives bodies on which a\r\n _post-mortem_ examination is required, and the bodies of unknown\r\n persons, placed there for recognition. In the hall where the bodies\r\n are exposed, the temperature is kept several degrees below zero by a\r\n system of refrigeration, thus retarding putrefaction. This system\r\n would, in consequence of the low temperature, greatly retard or\r\n prevent the revival of persons who may only be in a state of torpidity\r\n from submergence, or of trance or catalepsy, who could be resuscitated\r\n if warmth and other proper means were promptly applied to them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n BERLIN.\r\n\r\n “In some of the cemeteries mortuaries have been built, which are\r\n placed at the disposal of the public by the authorities, with the\r\n understanding that the corpses shall be taken from them as soon as\r\n possible.\r\n\r\n “The bodies of the poor are first placed in the depository of the old\r\n cemeteries, within the city enclosure, whence they are removed by\r\n night in carriages kept for the purpose to the mortuary in the large\r\n cemetery outside the city, to be buried the next day. The Jews have\r\n built a mortuary chapel in their new cemetery at Weissensee, which\r\n fulfils all the conditions required by modern hygiene, and contains\r\n everything necessary for washing, isolating, and enveloping the bodies.\r\n\r\n “A new establishment, which answers its purpose perfectly, has\r\n been built in the old cemetery--Charité--and is used for inquests,\r\n _post-mortem_ examinations, etc., also for the exhibition of bodies\r\n of unknown persons. The bodies are preserved from putrefaction by an\r\n apparatus in which refrigeration is produced by ammonia and chloride\r\n of calcium, as the Morgue in Paris.”\r\n\r\n\r\n VIENNA.\r\n\r\n “There is a mortuary in each district of the city to which are brought\r\n corpses belonging to families who have imperfect accommodations.\r\n\r\n “The district doctor must decide whether removal is necessary, as it\r\n is his duty to register deaths and their causes. He should at the same\r\n time examine into the state of the dwelling from a sanitary standpoint.\r\n\r\n “In cases of sudden death, and when the cause of death is not\r\n apparent, a _post-mortem_ examination must be made.\r\n\r\n “The bodies of persons who have died from infectious disease must not\r\n be taken to the common mortuaries, but to one built in the common\r\n cemetery.\r\n\r\n “Bodies must not be buried in the city. The principal cemetery is at\r\n Kaiser-Ebersdorf, north-west of the city, and cost four millions of\r\n marks.”\r\n\r\n\r\n STOCKHOLM.\r\n\r\n “Every parish possesses a mortuary vault. According to the regulations\r\n of the Health Commission, bodies must not remain there more than\r\n forty-eight hours in the hot season, and seventy-two in the cold\r\n weather.”\r\n\r\nThe first modern mortuary was opened at Weimar, Germany, in 1791.\r\n\r\nIn a “Handbook for Travellers in Europe” for 1890, by W. Pembroke\r\nFetridge, p. 622, is the following description of the model mortuary in\r\nWeimar:--\r\n\r\n “The New Church-yard is a sweet place of its kind. Here may be seen\r\n an admirable arrangement to prevent premature burials in cases of\r\n suspended animation. In a dark chamber, lighted with a small lamp,\r\n the body lies in a coffin. In its fingers are placed strings, which\r\n communicate with an alarm clock; the least pulsation of the corpse\r\n will ring the bell in an adjoining chamber, where a person is placed\r\n to watch, when a medical attendant is at once supplied. There have\r\n been several cases where persons supposed to be dead were thus saved\r\n from premature burial.”\r\n\r\nThe _Middlesborough Gazette_ of 11th October, 1895, says:--\r\n\r\n “Those who have visited burying grounds in some parts of the South\r\n of England are well aware that tombs made in the shape of ‘waiting\r\n rooms’ are largely in vogue with the well-to-do classes. One in a\r\n little church-yard in Sussex was elegantly fitted up. The coffins were\r\n placed on one side of the well-lighted vault, while on the opposite\r\n side was a couch, chairs, and a table, together with books. The\r\n relatives of the deceased--eccentric they may have been, we are not\r\n prepared to say--visited the vault, access to which was gained by a\r\n flight of steps, and there passed much of their time in reading, the\r\n ladies doing needle work. But this sort of thing is only for the\r\n rich. The poor must be protected from being buried alive by other and\r\n more economical methods--namely, by stricter attention to the actual\r\n and unmistakable evidences of death, and by careful registration on\r\n medical certificates only.”\r\n\r\nIt would appear by the following announcement, that an effort is being\r\nmade to supply one of the several properly fitted mortuaries needed in\r\nthe French capital:--\r\n\r\n “The _Pall Mall Gazette_ of September 21, 1895, announces a decided\r\n novelty in the way of limited liability companies--the Mortuary\r\n Waiting-room Company, which, it says, is on the point of being floated\r\n in the French capital. Our contemporary says that the amount for\r\n subscription is stated to be £20,000, and dividends at the rate of at\r\n least 100 per cent. may, it is claimed, be confidently looked for. The\r\n company undertake to provide separate waiting-rooms, of two classes,\r\n in a large mortuary building. The alleged corpse will be comfortably\r\n deposited there upon a couch, and carefully looked after till the\r\n fact that it is a corpse shall have been established beyond question.\r\n The waiting-rooms will be tastefully decorated, with everything about\r\n them to welcome the revived tenant agreeably back to life. It is\r\n interesting to hear that no shareholder’s heirs will be allowed to\r\n visit him.”\r\n\r\nSome sanitarians and funeral reformers urge with much reason that the\r\npresence of the dead should not be allowed to endanger the health of\r\nthe living, and recommend that if death has occurred from infectious\r\ndisease, the body should be covered with charcoal and conveyed at once\r\nto a mortuary chamber; and others advise early burials for all as soon\r\nas possible. If, however, this volume has not demonstrated the danger\r\nof such early burials, except where decay of the earthly vesture is\r\nvisible, it will have been written in vain.\r\n\r\nThe following recommendation from a well-known physician and surgeon\r\nappears in _London_, p. 613, September 27, 1894:--\r\n\r\n “Coroners’ Courts and Mortuaries,” a paper read at the Hygiene\r\n Congress at Buda Pesth, by W. J. Collins, M.D., M.S., B.Sc., D.P.H.\r\n (Lond.), L.C.C.\r\n\r\n “I therefore hold that every inducement should be held out to the\r\n poor by local authorities, by the provision of decent, suitable, and\r\n attractive mortuaries, to allow their dead to be removed from danger\r\n to the living to a place where sentiment shall be respected and\r\n sanitation satisfied.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UTILITY OF MORTUARIES.\r\n\r\n[THE MAYOR OF MUNICH’S OPINION.]\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion on Premature Burials in the press, the erection\r\nof mortuaries (chambres mortuaires d’attente) has been objected to\r\n(1) on the ground of expense to the rate-payers; and (2) because the\r\nresults by way of resuscitation of those constructed in Germany have\r\nnot justified the cost of their erection and maintenance, and that\r\nif they had not already been in existence they would not now, it is\r\nsaid, be established. The most recent investigations on this subject\r\nhave been made by Monsieur B. Gaubert, the results of which appear in\r\nhis work, “Les Chambres Mortuaires d’Attente,” a volume of 308 pages,\r\npublished in Paris, 1895. The author shows by the citation of facts\r\nthat both in France and Germany numerous cases of resuscitation of\r\npersons certified as dead, and deposited in mortuaries, in spite of\r\nmany drawbacks connected with their management, have occurred, and that\r\ntheir continuance is amply justified on the ground of utility. In the\r\nreport of the Municipal Council of Paris for 1880, No. 174, p. 84, is a\r\nletter from Herr Ehrhart, Mayor of Munich, May 2, 1880, who says:--“The\r\nlengthy period during which these establishments have been utilised,\r\nthe order which has always prevailed, the manner in which the\r\nremains are disposed and adorned, _the resuscitation of some who were\r\nbelieved to be dead_, have all contributed to remove any sentimental\r\nobjections to these establishments. The bodies are transported to the\r\nLeichenhäuser twelve hours after death, without the least opposition on\r\nthe part of the relatives.” The expense of these institutions would, no\r\ndoubt, in the aggregate be a considerable sum, but not nearly so large\r\nas that voted for the erection and maintenance of public libraries,\r\nnow so common; but in the presence of so serious and real a danger\r\nas that of living burial, to which any of us is liable, it is hardly\r\nworth considering. For peace of mind the cost of such insurance would\r\nbe cheerfully paid by thousands, and ought to be provided for the poor\r\nand for those who would in time come to value it. This is a matter that\r\nmight appropriately be taken up by the County, District, and Parish\r\nCouncils and Boards of Guardians, under the powers granted to them by\r\nthe Local Government Act of 1894.\r\n\r\nDr. Josat, in his treatise “De la mort et de ses caractères,” shows\r\nby numerous arguments and examples that, as there is an interval or\r\ncondition provided by nature between disease and health known as\r\n_convalescence_, and the transition between the one and the other\r\nis preceded by a variety of phenomena known as a _crisis_, so there\r\nis an interval between the termination of a fatal malady and real\r\ndeath (erroneously described as the agony), the symptoms which denote\r\nintermediate or apparent death. But while the result of an error may\r\nbe of little moment in the first case, it may in the other become\r\ndisastrous, by abandoning the dying before absolute death. It is during\r\nthis interval, between (so called) death agony and absolute death,\r\nwhich sometimes has been known to last a week, that the transfer to a\r\nsuitable mortuary should be made.\r\n\r\nThe following may be cited as typical illustrations of the utility of\r\nmortuaries in discovering the existence of life after apparent death.\r\n\r\n[AND CASES OF RESUSCITATION.]\r\n\r\nH. L. Kerthomas in “Dernières Considérations sur les Inhumations\r\nPrécipitées,” Lille, 1852, p. 17, relates that--\r\n\r\n “At a hospital in Liege two house-surgeons were at the ‘Salles des\r\n décades’ in pursuance of their anatomical studies, when hearing at\r\n one side of them a noise like stifled breathing great was their fear!\r\n Still they coolly finished their examination, and then discovered the\r\n supposed corpse moving convulsively amongst his dead companions; but,\r\n thanks to efficient help, he was completely restored to health.” (The\r\n above occurred in 1847.)\r\n\r\nM.B. Gaubert, in “Les Chambres Mortuaires d’Attente,” records the six\r\nfollowing cases:--“On the 25th of January, 1849, the _Journal des\r\nDébats_ recorded a fact somewhat similar to that which lately disturbed\r\nthe town of Perigueux:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “‘MUNICH.\r\n\r\n “‘A young man who was asphyxiated by charcoal had been declared dead\r\n by the doctor. After they had been watching the body twenty-four hours\r\n at the mortuary chamber, the family caused it to be carried to the\r\n church, where it passed the night without the customary caretaker. The\r\n next morning “the corpse” was found bathed in its own blood, and the\r\n floor of the church was stained. Restored to consciousness during the\r\n night and not having any help, the poor young man had succumbed to\r\n hæmorrhage, brought on by the incisions which they blindly practised\r\n on the body of the supposed dead one to make sure of his death.’\r\n\r\n “‘The mother of a family had just lost her child, aged five years. She\r\n carried to the Leichenhäuser a heart broken by grief, cherishing the\r\n vague hope in the depth of her love that this separation would not\r\n be the last. According to habit the families of Munich exposed the\r\n corpse in a mortuary chamber amidst flowers and trees, and surrounded\r\n by a circle of light. The Leichenhäus then appeared to have lost its\r\n habitual funereal character--for it had quite a festive air. The\r\n poor mother passed the night amidst tears and prayers, waiting with\r\n anxiety and hoping for the arrival of the good news. The next morning\r\n a workman of the Leichenhäuser knocked at the door of the house with\r\n a large bundle which he carried in his arms; a few seconds after, the\r\n mother pressed to her heart the resuscitated child which she was told\r\n she had just lost. The transports of joy she experienced were so great\r\n that she fell down dead. The child had come to life in the mortuary by\r\n himself, and, when the keeper saw it, it was playing with the white\r\n roses which had been placed on its shroud.’ (P. 179.)\r\n\r\n“The same recent writer quotes the following on the testimony of the\r\nsurgeons Louis and Junker:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “‘SALTPÉTRIÈRE.\r\n\r\n “‘A young country girl,’ said Surgeon Louis, ‘strong and vigorous,\r\n twenty-five years old, left on foot from the Hotel Dieu, Paris, where\r\n she had been resting the night before, and came to Saltpétrière. The\r\n fatigue of the journey induced an attack of syncope on her arrival.\r\n They put her on the bed, and with cordials and warmth she revived,\r\n but at the end of an hour she had another attack. They thought she\r\n was dead, and carried her to the mortuary. After leaving the body--it\r\n had remained there some time--they carried it to the amphitheatre.\r\n The next morning a young surgeon said he had heard plaintive cries in\r\n the amphitheatre, and his fear had prevented him from coming to tell\r\n me. I went into the amphitheatre, and saw with sorrow that the poor\r\n girl, who had vainly struggled to free herself from the sheet which\r\n enveloped her, was now quite dead. She had one leg on the floor, and\r\n an arm on the seat of the trestle of a dissecting table. I here recall\r\n the feelings of horror with which I was agitated on this occasion.\r\n I doubt if there ever was a sadder or more touching spectacle than\r\n this.’ (P. 187.)\r\n\r\n“BERLIN.\r\n\r\n“‘A Berlin apothecary wrote to me lately’ (says Dr. Lénormand) ‘in this\r\ntown to the effect that during an interval of two years and a-half, ten\r\npeople stated to be dead had been recalled to life. I shall quote only\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n “‘SOLDIER OF THE GUARD.\r\n\r\n “‘In the middle of the night the bell of the vestibule rang violently.\r\n The caretaker, who had only entered on duties within a few days, much\r\n startled, ran towards the mortuary. As soon as he opened the door he\r\n found himself confronted with one of “the corpses” enveloped in his\r\n shroud who had quitted his bier and was making his way out. He was a\r\n soldier of the guard believed to be dead, and he was able to join his\r\n regiment five days later.’ (_Ibid._, p. 180.)\r\n\r\n\r\n“FRANKFORT-ON-THE-MAINE.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Josat said that during his sojourn in Germany, Herr Schmill,\r\ndirector of the mortuary at Frankfort, related to him a case of\r\napparent death which occurred under his own eyes.\r\n\r\n “‘In the year 1840, a girl of nineteen years died of acute\r\n pleuro-pneumonia. Her body, during very hot weather, was exposed\r\n in the mortuary for a period of eight days in a state of perfect\r\n preservation. Her face retained its colour, the limbs were supple,\r\n and the substance of the cornea transparent, whereas in ordinary\r\n cases decomposition shows itself on the third day. The parents could\r\n not reconcile themselves to have their daughter buried, and found\r\n themselves much troubled. Finally on the ninth day the supposed dead\r\n suddenly awoke without any premonitory indications of life.’ (_Ibid._,\r\n p. 180.)\r\n\r\n\r\n“BELGIUM.\r\n\r\n“There was a case at Brussels in January, 1867, of a person who\r\nreturned to life just as the bearers arrived at the mortuary.\r\n\r\n “‘A workman of the suburbs, employed by a firm of carriers, fell ill,\r\n and in a few days died. This suddenness of the death caused doubts\r\n as to its reality, and after the usual delay he was taken to the\r\n mortuary connected with the cemetery. The body was left for a few\r\n days’ observation. As soon as they arrived a noise escaped from the\r\n coffin, and arrested the attention of the people present. At once they\r\n hastened towards the coffin, and tried to restore him, and in a short\r\n time he came to life. The same evening he was able to return to his\r\n home. On the following day he went himself to the authorities to annul\r\n the record of his supposed death.’” (P. 182.)\r\n\r\nM. Gaubert continues:--“We have collected in Germany fourteen cases of\r\napparent death followed by return to life in mortuaries, in spite of\r\nall that has been done for the prevention of such occurrences.” (P.\r\n182.)\r\n\r\n\r\n CASSEL.\r\n\r\n “Dr. E. Bouchut, in ‘Signes de la Mort,’ 3rd edition, p. 50, relates\r\n that an apothecary’s assistant had an attack of syncope, which\r\n continued for eight days, when he was apparently dead, and was removed\r\n to the mortuary of the Military Hospital, Cassel, where he was covered\r\n with a coarse wrapper and left amongst the dead. The following night\r\n he awoke from his lethargy, and, on recognising the horrible place\r\n where he was, dragged himself to the door and kicked against it. The\r\n noise was heard by the sentinel, aid arrived, and the patient was put\r\n in a warm bed, where he recovered. Dr. Bouchut says that, if he had\r\n been swathed in tight bandages, his efforts at release would have been\r\n futile, and he would have been buried alive.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLILLE.\r\n\r\nThe Paris _Figaro_, March 31, 1894, on the authority of the _Progrés du\r\nNord_, April 2, 1894, reports that:--\r\n\r\n “M. Vangiesen, aged eighty-one years, awakened from supposed death on\r\n the flagstones of the mortuary at the Charité Hospital at Lille.”\r\n\r\nThe _Undertakers’ Review_, January 22, 1894, reports that Lena Fellows,\r\naged twenty-two years, a servant in the employ of A. R. Knox, of\r\nBuffalo, fell dead, as was thought, while at work on December 8.\r\nThe remains were taken to the morgue in a coffin, but next morning\r\nwhen morgue-keeper McShane began to lift the supposed corpse into\r\nthe refrigerator he found that the woman was alive. It was a case of\r\ncatalepsy.\r\n\r\nThe case of a child found apparently dead in Regents’ Park, London,\r\nand carried to the Marylebone Mortuary, where it subsequently revived,\r\nhas already been noticed. The incident caused a good deal of comment,\r\nand suggested, doubtless, to the reflective reader that other cases of\r\nsuspended animation might have a less fortunate issue.\r\n\r\n[NEED OF CAREFUL SUPERVISION.]\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible on the Continent for an enquirer, as the author\r\nknows from experience, to obtain reliable information with regard\r\nto what takes place within the walls of mortuaries, because of the\r\nnumerous officials and others who are interested in covering up any\r\nerrors of previous death-certification that may come to light in\r\nthem. These comprise the health authorities, and the police in places\r\nwhere the latter regulate funerals, as well as the physicians, whose\r\ncredit is at stake, and the nurses and undertakers. In many districts\r\nin Germany the original object of the mortuaries--the prevention of\r\npremature burial--advocated by Hufeland and others, has not been kept\r\nin view, but the edifices have rather been used for the convenience\r\nof the undertakers and their assistants, the bodies in many cases\r\nbeing removed before actual dissolution was established by evidence\r\nof putrefaction. This will need to be guarded against by more careful\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is universally admitted that nothing is less certain than life; and\r\nif the reader will weigh the facts, which it has been the authors’\r\nintention to understate rather than overstate, he will rightly conclude\r\nthat nothing is more uncertain than the signs which are ordinarily\r\naccepted as indicating death. It would have been easy to fill a much\r\nlarger volume than this with reports of authentic cases of premature\r\nburial, and narrow escapes from such terrible mischances, and with more\r\ndetailed results of the authors’ researches on the subject in various\r\nparts of Europe and America, as well as in the East. The cases adduced\r\nto illustrate the text are, however, presented as types of hundreds of\r\nothers obtainable from equally reputable sources, and to be found in\r\nthe works of various trustworthy authorities, the titles of which can\r\nbe seen in the Bibliography at the end of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe _London Review_ for July, 1791, p. 40, referring to “An Essay\r\non Vital Suspension: Being an Attempt to Investigate and Ascertain\r\nthose Diseases in which the Principles of Life are Apparently\r\nExtinguished,” by a Medical Practitioner--observes, that this is one\r\nof many publications “written by physicians and surgeons, versed in\r\nmedical science, and well skilled in anatomy, to demonstrate, beyond\r\na possibility of contradiction, that there are many cases in which\r\nthe human body has the appearance of death, and preserves it for a\r\nconsiderable time, without the reality; the vital principle being\r\nstill unsubdued, and a restoration of all its powers and functions\r\npracticable by the administration, in due time, of proper means.”\r\nThe author of the pamphlet under review says, “It is a proof of the\r\ntemerity and imbecility of human judgment, that we have too many\r\ninstances on record, wherein even the most skilful physicians have\r\nerred in the decisions they have pronounced respecting the extinction\r\nof life.”\r\n\r\n[IMBECILITY OF HUMAN JUDGMENT.]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we appear to be no nearer the prevention of these\r\nterrible mistakes now than we were when the reviewer called attention\r\nto them a century ago. The imbecility of human judgment complained\r\nof exists now in an unmitigated degree. The appearance of death is\r\ngenerally taken for its reality: and the great mass of the inhabitants\r\nof this planet are hurried to their graves without (except in a\r\ncomparatively few cases of drowning or poisoning) the application of\r\nany serious efforts at restoration, and without waiting for unequivocal\r\nsigns of dissolution.\r\n\r\nWhether the risks of being buried alive are as great as those declared\r\nby some of the authorities quoted in this volume, must be left to the\r\nreader to determine for himself; but that they are considerable there\r\nappears little room for doubt by those who have taken the trouble to\r\ninquire into the facts. How often is the reader shocked by reading\r\nnarratives in his daily or weekly newspaper of persons either buried\r\nalive, or of those in a state of suspended animation, but diagnosed and\r\nduly certificated by the attending doctor as dead, who have returned to\r\nconsciousness during the funeral rites or at the grave itself.\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_ has borne frequent testimony to these disasters, some\r\nof which are quoted in this volume; and, just as we are writing the\r\nclosing chapter, the leading medical journal, in its issue of September\r\n12, 1896, p. 785, records the following from its Cork correspondent as\r\nhaving occurred at Little Island, Ireland, which, the writer says, is\r\nthoroughly vouched for:--\r\n\r\n“A child of four years of age contracted (typhoid) fever, and to all\r\nordinary appearances died. The time of the funeral was appointed, and\r\nfriends were actually on their way to attend it. When the supposed\r\ncorpse was about to be removed from the bed to the coffin, signs of\r\nanimation were exhibited. The services of the medical man were again\r\nrequisitioned, and the child, opportunely rescued from such a terrible\r\ndeath, is now progressing satisfactorily.”\r\n\r\nAmongst the headings of paragraphs taken from recent papers lying\r\nbefore me are the following:--“Buried Alive,” “A Gruesome Narrative,”\r\n“Restored to Life in a Mortuary,” “Premature Burial,” “The Dead Alive,”\r\n“Buried Alive,” “Sounds from Another Coffin,” “Mistaken for Dead,” “A\r\nLady Nearly Buried Alive,” “Revivification After Burial,” “A Woman’s\r\nAwful Experience,” “Bolt Upright in His Coffin,” “Almost Buried while\r\nAlive,” “A Woman Buried Alive,” “The Corpse Sat Up,” “Alive in Her\r\nCoffin,” “Seemed to Rise from Death,” “Escaped Burial Alive,” “Revival\r\nat a Wake,” “Snatched from Death at the Graveside,” “Laid Out, but not\r\nDead,” “Alive in His Grave,” “Interment before Death,” “Came to Life in\r\nthe Coffin,” “Corpse Seems to Live,” “The Corpse Moved,” etc.\r\n\r\nAccording to the “London Manual and Municipal Year Book,” 1896-97,\r\nthere are over four hundred public authorities at work in governing\r\nLondon, who spend over twelve million pounds a year, and from other\r\nsources it is said that seven millions a year are collected in the\r\nMetropolis for charitable purposes, and yet there are no officials,\r\nassociations, or insurance companies to safeguard the people either in\r\nthis wealthy Metropolis or in any part of the United Kingdom against\r\none of the most terrible physical calamities that can overtake any\r\nmember of the human family.\r\n\r\n[EXPECTATIONS OF LIFE.]\r\n\r\nThe Registrar-General’s Decennial Supplement for 1881-90, published\r\nthis year (1896), includes a “Life Table” furnishing the expectations\r\nof life in England and Wales. It appears that the death-rate has fallen\r\nfrom 21.3 in the decade ending 1880 to 19.0 per thousand living in\r\nthat ending 1890. The expectation of life at birth, according to the\r\nactuary’s standard in the decade 1871-80, was 41.3 years for males, and\r\n44.6 years for females. This has been increased, as shown in the “Life\r\nTable” 1881-90, to 43.6 for males, and 47.2 for females, mainly through\r\nsanitary amelioration. A perceptible increase, the author believes,\r\ncould be shown if steps were taken to restore still-born children, who\r\nconstitute about five per cent. of births, and if the same trouble were\r\nadopted to restore the apparently dead from other diseases (which are\r\nsometimes only crises of repose after wasting disease) as is generally\r\ntaken with respect to those accidentally poisoned or drowned. Besides\r\nreducing the mortality and increasing the expectation of life, such\r\na reform would greatly diminish the appalling suffering of those\r\nwho, through our apathy and ignorance, are, under our present system\r\nof _laissez faire_, consigned to precipitate interment, and would\r\nbring tranquillity of mind to those who are haunted all their lives\r\nthrough fear of such a catastrophe. Why we should limit our efforts\r\nat restoration of those apparently dead to a few cases has never been\r\nshown, and is surely a serious oversight, which should be remedied\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nDr. Hartmann, in “Premature Burial,” observes--“As by cleaning a\r\ndusty watch the watchmaker causes the hindrances to be removed which\r\nprevented the energy stored up in the watch from setting the clockwork\r\nin motion, so, in cases of apparent death from catalepsy, asphyxia,\r\nsyncope, and other diseases causing obstacles to the manifestation\r\nof the life-energy in the body, these obstacles may be removed by\r\nappropriate means, such as are known to many intelligent physicians,\r\nand the energy of life being latent in the physical form may be enabled\r\nto manifest itself again when the harmony of the organism has been\r\nsufficiently restored, even after the heart has entirely ceased to\r\nbeat.”\r\n\r\nDr. A. Fothergill says:--“Since no one, from prince to peasant, can\r\nat all times be secure from these dreadful disasters, which suddenly\r\nsuspend vital action; and since medical practitioners themselves are\r\nnot exempt, it surely becomes them to use every exertion to _improve_\r\nthe art of _restoring animation_. May each progressive step in this\r\ninteresting path of science tend to that great object! and may every\r\nlaudable attempt undertaken with that benevolent view enable us with\r\nmore certainty to preserve life and to diminish the sum of human\r\ninfelicity!”\r\n\r\nIt is regrettable that medical practitioners, neither in this nor in\r\nany of the Continental states, except, possibly, a few in Germany,\r\nhave been trained to distinguish apparent from real death; and when\r\na case of death-trance occurs, they certify to actual death, and the\r\nunfortunate person is interred in a strong coffin, which effectually\r\nconceals the tragedy following resuscitation. Moreover, the ordinary\r\npractitioner, both in England and the United States, considers himself\r\nexonerated from blame when he thus follows the traditions and practice\r\nof the heads of his profession. Personally, he has neither the time,\r\nopportunity, or inclination to study the abnormal phenomena of trance,\r\ncatalepsy, or hypnotisation, and thus the evil of live sepulture is\r\nperpetuated from generation to generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n(1) An examination of both the historical and modern cases of trance,\r\ncatalepsy, and other death-counterfeits shows that nothing is more\r\nuncertain than the so-called signs of death, and that in all countries\r\nand in all ages many persons supposed by their attendant physicians and\r\nrelations to be dead have revived, while the cases are as numerous and\r\nthe danger as great at the present day as at any previous period.\r\n\r\n(2) That the risk of premature burial is especially serious in France,\r\nin Spain and Portugal, in the west of Ireland, in both European and\r\nAsiatic Turkey, and in India; also amongst the Jews, where both the\r\nJewish law and ancient customs enjoin burial within a few hours of\r\ndeath, and for similar reasons in all Oriental countries; and in the\r\nSouthern States of North America.\r\n\r\n(3) That the various signs which are supposed to indicate death, such\r\nas the cessation of respiration and of cardiac action, a pale, waxy\r\nand death-like appearance, the stiffening of the limbs, or _rigor\r\nmortis_, insensibility to cutaneous excitation, the departure of heat\r\nfrom the body, are singly and collectively illusory; the only safe and\r\ninfallible test of dissolution being the manifestation of putrefaction\r\nin the abdomen.\r\n\r\n(4) That medical death-certificates have been shown by various\r\nwitnesses before the Select Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry\r\nof 1893-94 to be often misleading as to the cause of death, and\r\ninconclusive as to the fact of death. Any compulsory extension of the\r\ndeath-certification system in the present imperfect state of medical\r\nknowledge would only partially meet the necessities of the case,\r\nand might have the effect of crystallising a defective system into\r\nperfunctory routine. A certain safeguard would, however, be provided\r\nif the law made it binding on medical practitioners to set forth on\r\nthe death-certificate a precise statement of indications showing that\r\ndissolution has actually occurred.\r\n\r\n(5) That the only safe and effective method of reform is the\r\nestablishment of appropriately designed waiting mortuaries, such as\r\nare provided at Munich, Weimar, Stuttgart, and other German cities,\r\nwith qualified attendants and appliances for resuscitation, and where\r\ndoubtful cases of death (and all are doubtful in which decomposition\r\nhas not clearly manifested itself) can be deposited until the fact of\r\ndeath is unequivocally established.\r\n\r\n(6) That premature burial in civilised countries is mainly possible\r\nowing to the fact that instruction in the phenomena of trance,\r\ncatalepsy, syncope, and other forms of suspended animation is not\r\nsystematic in the medical schools in any country, and the means of\r\nprevention are therefore practically unknown. This omission should be\r\nimmediately remedied by the inclusion of the subject at the appropriate\r\nplace in the medical curriculum, and in the examination for degrees.\r\n\r\n(7) That, inasmuch as a radical change in the methods of treating\r\nthe dead or supposed dead is extremely urgent, and legislation with\r\nan overworked Parliament in England and apathetic State Legislatures\r\nin America will probably be delayed, the authors recommend, as a\r\npreliminary measure of protection, the formation of associations for\r\nthe prevention of premature burial amongst their members, as in some\r\ncities in France, Austria, and the United States, or the alternative\r\nplan of engrafting such an obligation of prevention upon existing\r\nassociations, clubs, and insurance companies established for other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing conclusions are established, the need for immediate\r\naction is urgent and imperative, and the prompt intervention of\r\nParliament should be at once invoked. May we hope for the cordial\r\nco-operation of all classes and of all sections on a question in\r\nwhich the whole community have a deep and vital interest, and on which\r\nprocrastination will certainly be fatal to some of its members. It is\r\nnot an academic question, but one of the gravest practical character,\r\nthe earnest consideration and treatment of which cannot be neglected\r\nwith impunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL CASES OF RESTORATION FROM APPARENT DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM the time of Kornmann, Terilli, and Zacchia (see “Bibliography,”\r\nseventeenth century), certain notable instances, from old authors,\r\nof restoration from apparent death have been cited, with a good deal\r\nof uniformity, in essays or theses on this subject. One of the most\r\nconvenient (to English readers) of these compilations is to be found in\r\nan anonymous essay, “The Uncertainty of the Signs of Death,” Dublin,\r\n1748 (printed by George Faulkner), from which the following extracts\r\nare taken _verbatim_:--\r\n\r\nPlutarch informs us that a certain person fell from an eminence, but\r\ndid not show the least appearance of any wound, for, three days after,\r\nhe suddenly resumed his strength, and returned to life as his friends\r\nwere conveying him to the grave.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades, a celebrated physician, on his return from his country\r\nseat, met a large company conveying a corpse to the grave. A principle\r\nof curiosity induced him to ask the name of the deceased person, but\r\ngrief and sorrow reigned so universally that no one returned him\r\nanswer; upon which, approaching the corpse, he found the whole of it\r\nrubbed over with perfumes, and the mouth moistened with precious balm,\r\naccording to the custom of the Greeks; then carefully feeling every\r\npart, and discovering latent signs of life, he forthwith affirmed that\r\nthe person was not dead, and the person was saved.--_Celsus ii., 6, “De\r\nre Medica.”_\r\n\r\nIn the tenth book of Plato’s Republic is related the story of one\r\nEr, an Armenian, who was slain in battle. Ten days after, when the\r\nsurviving soldiers came with a view to inter the dead, they found all\r\nthe bodies corrupted except his; for which reason they conveyed him to\r\nhis own house in order to inter him in the usual manner. But two days\r\nafter, to the great surprise of all present, he returned to life when\r\nlaid on the funeral pile. Quenstedt remarks upon this case, which he\r\ntook from Kornmann’s treatise “De Miraculis Mortuorum,” “That the soul\r\nsometimes remains in the body when the senses are so fettered, and, as\r\nit were, locked up, that it is hard to determine whether a person is\r\ndead or alive.” Pliny in his “Natural History,” book vii., chap. 52,\r\nwhich treats of _those who have returned to life when they were about\r\nto be laid in the grave_, tells us that Acilius Aviola, a man of so\r\nconsiderable distinction that he had formerly been honoured with the\r\nconsulship, returned to life when he was upon the funeral pile; but, as\r\nhe could not be rescued from the violence of the flames, he was burnt\r\nalive. The like misfortune also happened to Lucius Lamia, who had been\r\npraetor. These two shocking accidents are also related by Valerius\r\nMaximus. Celius Tubero had a happier fate than his two fellow-citizens,\r\nsince, according to Pliny, he discovered the signs of life before it\r\nwas too late. His state, however, was far from eligible, since, being\r\nlaid on the funeral pile, he stood a fair chance of being exposed to\r\nthe like misfortune. Pliny, from the testimony of Varro, adds that when\r\na distribution of land was making at Capua, a certain man, when carried\r\na considerable way from his own house in order to be interred, returned\r\nhome on foot. The like surprising accident also happened at Aquinum.\r\nThe last instance of this nature related by the author occurred at\r\nRome, and Pliny must, no doubt, have been intimately acquainted with\r\nall its most minute circumstances, since the person was one Cerfidius,\r\nthe husband of his mother’s sister, who returned to life after an\r\nagreement had been made for his funeral with the undertaker, who was\r\nprobably much disappointed when he found him alive and in good health.\r\n\r\nThese examples drawn from Roman history greatly contribute to establish\r\nthe uncertainty of the signs of death, and ought to render us very\r\ncautious with respect to interments.\r\n\r\nGreece and Italy are not the only theatres in which such tragical\r\nevents have been acted, since other countries of Europe also furnish\r\nus with instances of a like nature. Thus, Maximilian Misson, in his\r\n“Voyage Through Italy,” tome i, letter 5, tells us--\r\n\r\n“That the number of persons who have been interred as dead, when they\r\nwere really alive, is very great in comparison with those who have\r\nbeen happily rescued from their graves; for, in the town of Cologne,\r\nArchbishop Geron--according to Albertus Krantzïus--was interred alive,\r\nand died for want of a seasonable releasement.”\r\n\r\nIt is also certain that in the same town the like misfortune happened\r\nto Johannes Duns Scotus, who in his grave tore his hands and wounded\r\nhis head. Misson also relates the following:--\r\n\r\n“Some years ago the wife of one, Mr. Mervache, a goldsmith of\r\nPoictiers, being buried with some rings on her fingers, as she had\r\ndesired when dying, a poor man of the neighbourhood, being apprised\r\nof that circumstance, next night opened the grave in order to make\r\nhimself master of the rings, but as he could not pull them off without\r\nsome violence, he in the attempt waked the woman, who spoke distinctly,\r\nand complained of the injury done her. Upon this, the robber made\r\nhis escape. The woman, now roused from an apoplectic fit, rose from\r\nher coffin, returned to her own house, and in a few days recovered a\r\nperfect state of health.”\r\n\r\nWhat induced Misson to relate these histories was a certain piece of\r\npainting preserved in the Church of the Holy Apostles at Cologne, in\r\norder to keep up the memory of a certain accident, which that traveller\r\nrelates in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n“In the year 1571, the wife of one of the magistrates of Cologne being\r\ninterred with a valuable ring on one of her fingers, the grave-digger\r\nnext night opened the grave in order to take it off, but we may readily\r\nsuppose that he was in no small consternation when the supposed dead\r\nbody squeezed his hand, and laid fast hold of him, in order to get\r\nout of her coffin. The thief, however, disengaging himself, made his\r\nescape with all expedition; and the lady, disentangling herself in the\r\nbest manner she could, went home and knocked at her own door, where,\r\nafter shivering in her shroud, after some delay she was admitted by the\r\nterror-stricken servants; and, being warmed and treated in a proper\r\nmanner, completely recovered.”\r\n\r\nSimon Goubart, in his admirable and memorable histories, printed at\r\nGeneva in 1628, relates the following accident:--“A lady, whose name\r\nwas Reichmuth Adoloh, was supposed to fall a victim to a pestilence,\r\nwhich raged with such impetuous fury as to cut off most of the\r\ninhabitants of Cologne. Soon after, however, she not only recovered her\r\nhealth, but also brought into the world three sons, who, in process of\r\ntime, were advanced to livings in the Church.”\r\n\r\n“The town of Dijon, in Burgundy, was, in the year 1558, afflicted\r\nwith a violent plague, which cut off the inhabitants so fast that\r\nthere was not time for each dead person to have a separate grave;\r\nfor which reason large pits were made and filled with as many bodies\r\nas they could contain. In this deplorable conjuncture, Mrs. Nicole\r\nTentillet shared the common fate, and after labouring under the\r\ndisorder for some days, fell into a syncope so profound that she was\r\ntaken for dead, and accordingly buried in a pit with the other dead\r\nbodies. The next morning after her interment she returned to life,\r\nand made the strongest efforts to get out, but was held down by the\r\nweight of the bodies with which she was covered. She remained in this\r\nwretched condition for four days, when the grave-diggers took her out\r\nand carried her to her own house, where she recovered perfectly.”\r\nFollowing this case, that of a labouring man of Courçelles, near\r\nNeuchâtel, is narrated. He fell into so profound syncope that he was\r\ntaken for dead; but the persons who were putting him into his grave\r\nwithout a coffin, perceived some motion in his shoulders, for which\r\nreason they carried him to his own home, where he perfectly recovered.\r\nThis accident laid the foundation for his being called the ghost of\r\nCourçelles.\r\n\r\n“A lawyer of Vesoul, a town of Franche-Comté, near Besançon, so\r\ncarefully concealed a lethargy, to which he was subject, that nobody\r\nknew anything of his disorder, though the paroxysms returned very\r\nfrequently. The motive which principally induced him to this secrecy\r\nwas the dread of losing a lady to whom he was just about to be married.\r\nBeing afraid, however, lest some paroxysm should prove fatal to him,\r\nhe communicated his case to the Sheriff of the town, who, by virtue of\r\nhis office, was obliged to take care of him if such a misfortune should\r\nhappen. The marriage was concluded, and the lawyer for a considerable\r\ntime enjoyed a perfect state of health, but at last was seized with so\r\nviolent a paroxysm of the disease that his lady, to whom he had not\r\nrevealed the secret, not doubting his death, ordered him to be put in\r\nhis coffin. The Sheriff, though absent when the paroxysm seized him,\r\nluckily returned in time to preserve him; for he ordered the interment\r\nto be delayed, and the lawyer, returning to life, survived the accident\r\nsixteen years.”\r\n\r\nAnother case is that of a certain person who was conveyed to the church\r\nin order to be interred, but one of his friends sprinkling a large\r\nquantity of holy water on his face, which was covered, he not only\r\nreturned to life, but also resumed a perfect state of health.\r\n\r\nThis writer subjoins other histories of persons who, being interred\r\nalive, have expired in their graves and tombs, as has afterwards been\r\ndiscovered by various marks made, not only in their sepulchres, but\r\nalso in their own bodies. He in a particular manner mentions a young\r\nlady of Auxbourg, who, falling into a syncope, in consequence of a\r\nsuffocation of the matrix, was buried in a deep vault, without being\r\ncovered with earth, because her friends thought it sufficient to have\r\nthe vault carefully shut up. Some years after, however, one of the\r\nfamily happened to die; the vault was opened, and the body of the young\r\nlady found on the stairs at its entry, without any fingers on the right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded in “Tr. de Aere et Alim. defect.,” cap. vii., that a\r\ncertain woman was hanged, and in all appearances was dead, who was\r\nnevertheless restored to life by a physician accidentally coming in and\r\nordering a plentiful administration of sal ammoniac.\r\n\r\nAnother case of hanging is the story of Anne Green, executed at Oxford,\r\nDecember 14, 1650. She was hanged by the neck for half an hour,\r\nsome of her friends thumping her on the breast, others hanging with\r\nall their weight upon her legs, and then pulling her down again with\r\na sudden jerk, thereby the sooner to despatch her out of her pain.\r\nAfter she was in her coffin, being observed to breathe, a lusty fellow\r\nstamped with all his force on her breast and stomach to put her out of\r\npain. But by the assistance of Dr. Petty, Dr. Willis, Dr. Bathurst, and\r\nDr. Clark, she was again brought to life.\r\n\r\nKornmann, in his treatise “De Miraculis Mortuorum,” relates the\r\nfollowing history:--“Saint Augustine, from Saint Cirille, informs\r\nus that a Cardinal of the name of Andrew having died in Rome in the\r\npresence of several bystanders, was next day conveyed to the church,\r\nwhere the Pope and a body of the clergy attended service in order to do\r\nhonour to his memory. But to their great surprise, after some groans,\r\nhe recovered his life and senses. This event was at the time looked\r\nupon as a miracle, and ascribed to Saint Jerome to whom the Cardinal\r\nwas greatly attached.”\r\n\r\nThe following account seems more to resemble a miracle, though we do\r\nnot find that it was looked upon as such:--“Gocellinus, a young man,\r\nand nephew to one of the Archbishops of Cologne, falling into the\r\nRhine, was not found for fifteen days after, but was discovered to be\r\nalive as he lay before the shrine of Saint Guibert.”\r\n\r\nPersons curious or incredulous upon the dangers of precipitate burials\r\nmay, for their satisfaction, have recourse to the medical observations\r\nof Forestus; those of Amatus Lusitanus; the chirurgical observations of\r\nWilliam Fabri; the treatise of Levinus Lemnius on the secret miracles\r\nof Nature; the observations of Schenkins; the medico-legal questions\r\nof Paul Zacchias; Albertinus Bottonus’s treatise of the Disorders of\r\nWomen; Terilli’s treatise on the Causes of Sudden Death; Lancisi’s\r\ntreatise Concerning Deaths, and Kornmann’s treatise on the Miracles of\r\nthe Dead. These authors furnish us with a great variety of the most\r\npalpable and flagrant instances of the uncertainty of the signs of\r\ndeath. As examples of the possibility of even great anatomists being\r\nimposed upon by these fallacious signs, the two following accidents are\r\ngiven:--\r\n\r\n“Andreas Vesalius, successively first physician to Charles the Fifth\r\nand his son Philip the Second of Spain, being persuaded that a certain\r\nSpanish gentleman, whom he had under management, was dead, asked\r\nliberty of his friends to lay open his body. His request being granted,\r\nhe no sooner plunged his dissecting-knife in the body than he observed\r\nsigns of life in it, since, upon opening the breast, he saw the heart\r\npalpitating. The friends of the deceased, horrified by the accident,\r\npursued Vesalius as a murderer; and the judges inclined that he should\r\nsuffer as such. By the entreaties of the King of Spain, he was rescued\r\nfrom the threatening danger, on condition that he would expiate his\r\ncrime by undertaking a voyage to the Holy Land.”\r\n\r\nThe account of the accident that befell the other anatomist is taken\r\nfrom Terilli, and runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n“A lady of distinction in Spain, being seized with an hysteric\r\nsuffocation so violent that she was thought irretrievably dead, her\r\nfriends employed a celebrated anatomist to lay open her body to\r\ndiscover the cause of her death. Upon the second stroke of the knife\r\nshe was roused from her disorder, and discovered evident signs of\r\nlife by her lamentable shrieks extorted by the fatal instrument. This\r\nmelancholy spectacle struck the bystanders with so much consternation\r\nand horror that the anatomist, now no less condemned and abhorred\r\nthan before applauded and extolled, was forthwith obliged to quit not\r\nonly the town but also the province in which the guiltless tragedy\r\nwas acted. But though he quitted the now disagreeable scene of the\r\naccident, a groundless remorse preyed upon his soul, till at last a\r\nfatal melancholy put an end to his life.”\r\n\r\nPhysicians of the earlier ages knew that there were disorders which so\r\nlocked up or destroyed the external senses that the patients labouring\r\nunder them appeared to be dead. According to Mr. Le Clerc, in his\r\n“History of Medicine,” Diogenes Laertius informs us “that Empedocles\r\nwas particularly admired for curing a woman supposed to be dead, though\r\nthat philosopher frankly acknowledged that her disorder was only a\r\nsuffocation of the matrix, and affirmed that the patient might live in\r\nthat state (the absence of respiration) for thirty days.”\r\n\r\nMr. Le Clerc, in the work already quoted, tells us that “Heraclides\r\nof Pontus wrote a book concerning the causes of diseases, in which he\r\naffirmed that a patient is without respiration in certain disorders\r\nfor thirty days, and that they appeared dead in every respect, except\r\ncorruption of the body.”\r\n\r\nTo these authorities we may add that of Pliny, who, after mentioning\r\nthe lamentable fate of Aviola and Lamia, affirms--“That such is the\r\ncondition of humanity, and so uncertain the judgment men are capable of\r\nforming of things, that even death itself is not to be trusted to.”\r\n\r\nColerus, in “Oeconom.” part vi., lib. xviii., cap. 113, observes, “That\r\na person as yet not really dead may, for a long time, remain apparently\r\nin that state without discovering the least signs of life; and this has\r\nhappened in the times of the Plague, when a great many persons interred\r\nhave returned to life in their graves.” Authors also inform us that the\r\nlike accident frequently befalls women seized with a suffocation of the\r\nmatrix (hysteria).\r\n\r\nForestus, in “Obs. Med.,” 1. xvii., obs. 9, informs us--“That drowned\r\npersons have returned to life after remaining forty-eight hours in the\r\nwater; and sometimes women, buried during a paroxysm of the hysteric\r\npassion, have returned to life in their graves; for which reason it is\r\nforbidden in some countries to bury the dead sooner than seventy-two\r\nhours after death.” This precaution of delaying the interment of\r\npersons thought to be dead is of a very ancient date, since Dilberus,\r\nin “Disput. Philol.,” tome i., observes that Plato ordered the bodies\r\nof the dead to be kept till the third day, _in order to be satisfied of\r\nthe reality of death_.\r\n\r\nThe burial customs of the ancients often included steps that were taken\r\nas a precaution against mistaking the living for the dead. Indeed the\r\nfear of such an accident seems to have always been entertained as a\r\nthing liable to occur in every case of seeming death. The embalming\r\nprocess employed by the Egyptians was a surgical test of the kind.\r\nThe abdomen was first opened in order to remove the intestines, and\r\nsome startling experiences must have been had in consequence of the\r\nincisions required for this operation, because it was customary for the\r\nfriends and relatives of the deceased to throw stones at the persons\r\nemployed in embalming as soon as the work was over, owing to the horror\r\nwith which they were struck upon witnessing what must have been at\r\ntimes a cruel proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe funeral ceremonies used in the Caribbee Islands are, in a great\r\nmeasure, conformable to reason. They wash the body, wrap it up in\r\na cloth, and then begin a series of lamentations and discourses\r\ncalculated to recall the deceased to life, by naming all the pleasures\r\nand privileges he has enjoyed in the world, saying over and over again,\r\n“How comes it, then, that you have died?” When the lamentations are\r\nover, they place the body on a small seat, in a grave about four or\r\nfive feet deep, and for ten days present aliments to it, entreating it\r\nto eat. Then, convinced that it would neither eat nor return to life,\r\nthey, for its obstinacy, throw the victuals on its head, and cover up\r\nthe grave. It is evident from the practices of this people that they\r\nwait so long before they cover the body with earth, because they have\r\nhad instances of persons recalled to life by these measures.\r\n\r\nLamentations of a similar kind were employed by the Jews and Romans, as\r\nwell as by the ancient Prussians and the inhabitants of Servia, founded\r\ndoubtless upon similar experiences.\r\n\r\nThe Thracians, according to Herodotus, kept their dead for only three\r\ndays, at the end of which time they offered up sacrifices of all kinds,\r\nand, after bidding their last adieu to the deceased, either burned or\r\ninterred their bodies.\r\n\r\nAccording to Quenstedt, the ancient Russians laid the body of the dead\r\nperson naked on a table, and washed it for an hour with warm water.\r\nThen they put it into a bier, which was set in the most public room in\r\nthe house. On the third day they conveyed it to the place of interment,\r\nwhere the bier, being opened, the women embraced the body with great\r\nlamentations. Then the singers spent an hour in shouting and making\r\na noise in order to recall it to life; after which it was let down\r\ninto the grave and covered with earth. So that this people used the\r\ntest of warm water, that of cries, and a reasonable delay, before they\r\nproceeded to the interment.\r\n\r\nIn the laws and history of the Jews, there is but one regulation with\r\nrespect to interment (in the twenty-first chapter of Deuteronomy),\r\nwhere the Jewish legislator orders persons hanged to be buried the same\r\nday. From this, one is led to infer that the funeral ceremonies, as\r\nhanded down from Adam, were otherwise perfect and unexceptionable. The\r\nbier used by the Jews, on which the body was laid, was not shut at the\r\ntop, as our coffins are, as is obvious from the resurrection of the\r\nWidow of Nain’s son, recorded in the seventh chapter of Luke, where\r\nthese words occur:--“And he came and touched the bier, and they that\r\nbare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise;\r\nand he that was dead sat up and began to speak.”\r\n\r\nGierus and Calmet inform us that the body, before its interment, lay\r\nfor some days in the porch or dining-room of the house. According to\r\nMaretus, it was probably during this time that great lamentations were\r\nmade, in which the name of the deceased was intermixed with mournful\r\ncries and groans.\r\n\r\nMr. Boyer, member of the Faculty at Paris, observes that such\r\nlamentations are still used by the Eastern Jews, and even by the Greeks\r\nwho embrace the articles of the Greek Church. These people hire women\r\nto weep and dance by turns round the body of the dead person, whom they\r\ninterrogate with respect to the reasons they had for dying.\r\n\r\nLanzoni, a physician of Ferrara, informs us that “when any person among\r\nthe Romans died, his nearest relatives closed his mouth and eyes, and\r\nwhen they saw him ready to expire, they caught his last words and\r\nsighs. Then calling him aloud three times by his name, they bade him an\r\neternal adieu.” This ceremony of calling the name of the dying person\r\nwas called Conclamation, a custom that dates prior to the foundation of\r\nRome, and was only abolished with paganism.\r\n\r\nPropertius acquaints us with the effect they expected from the\r\nfirst Conclamation--since there were several of them. He introduces\r\nCynthia as saying, “Nobody called me by my name at the time my eyes\r\nwere closing, and I should have enjoyed an additional day if you had\r\nrecalled me to life.”\r\n\r\nConclamations were made also by trumpets and horns, blown upon the\r\nhead, into the ears, and upon neck and chest, so as to penetrate all\r\nthe cavities of the body, into which, as the ancients imagined, the\r\nsoul might possibly make her retreat.\r\n\r\nQuenstedt and Casper Barthius, in “Advers.,” lib. xxxvii., ch. 17, tell\r\nus that it was customary among the ancients to wash the bodies of their\r\ndead in warm water before they burned them, “that the heat of the water\r\nmight rouse the languid principle of life which might possibly be left\r\nin the body.”\r\n\r\nBy warm water we are to understand boiling water, as is obvious from\r\nthe copious steam arising from the vessel represented in pieces of\r\nstatuary in such instances: as also from the Sixth Book of Virgil’s\r\n“Æneid”--“Some of the companions of Æneas, with boiling water taken\r\nfrom brazen vessels, wash the dead body, and then anoint it.”\r\n\r\nThe Romans, as Lanzoni informs us, kept the bodies of the dead seven\r\ndays before they interred them; and Servius, in his commentary on\r\nVirgil, tells us “that on the eighth day they burned the body, and\r\non the ninth put its ashes in the grave.” Polydorus and Alexander ab\r\nAlexandro are also of opinion that the Romans kept the dead seven\r\ndays; and Gierus affirms that they sometimes did not bury them till\r\nthe ninth; but it is easy to believe that they deviated from the most\r\nuniversal custom when evident and incontestable marks of death rendered\r\nit safe to inter before the usual time. Alexander ab Alexandro also\r\nobserves that it was customary among the Greeks to keep the bodies of\r\ntheir dead seven days before they put them on the funeral pile.\r\n\r\nIt would have, perhaps, been sufficient to have kept the bodies of the\r\ndead seven days, or nine, or till putrefaction evinced the certainty of\r\ndeath; but the Romans carried their circumspection farther, since, to\r\nuse the words of Quenstedt, “Those who were employed in watching the\r\ndead now and then began their conclamations, and all at once called\r\nthe dead person aloud by his name, because, as Celsus informs us, the\r\nprinciple of life is often thought to have left the body when it still\r\nremains in it; for which reason conclamations were made, in order, if\r\npossible, to rouse it and excite it.”\r\n\r\nIf our senses are so imperfect that the signs of life may escape\r\nthem; if the languid state of the sensitive powers, or the origin of\r\nthe nerves, is such that the most painful chirurgical operations are\r\nsometimes insufficient to put the spirits in motion; if the duration\r\nof a perfect insensibility for a considerable number of days is a\r\nprecarious and uncertain mark of death; and if situations, apparently\r\nthe most inconsistent with life, for a considerable time amount only to\r\nstrong presumptions that life is destroyed, we ought, with Mr. Winslow\r\nand a great many other celebrated authors, to conclude that a beginning\r\nof putrefaction is the only certain sign of death.\r\n\r\nMr. Winslow evidently proves that the most cruel chirurgical operations\r\nare sometimes insufficient to ascertain death. From these observations\r\nwe can but conclude--(1) That it is to no purpose to use the most\r\ncruel chirurgical operations; and (2) that it is necessary to abstain\r\nfrom such as may prove mortal to the patient. Mr. Winslow is indeed so\r\nfar from recommending operations of the last mentioned kind, that he\r\ncalls it rash to plunge a long needle under the nail of an apoplectic\r\npatient’s toe.\r\n\r\nBut if Mr. Winslow thinks it rash to make a simple puncture in a\r\nnervous part, we ought, surely, not to entertain a favourable notion of\r\nthe large and enormous incisions made in dissections. Those, indeed,\r\nwho are dissected run no risk of being interred alive. The operation is\r\nan infallible means to secure them from so terrible a fate. This is one\r\nadvantage which persons dissected have over those who are without any\r\nfurther ceremony shut up in their coffins.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the appendix to the second edition of Dr. Curry’s “Observations on\r\nApparent Death” several instances of a similar kind are added, and\r\namongst others the case of William Earl of Pembroke, who died April\r\n30, 1630. When the body was opened in order to be embalmed, he was\r\nobserved, immediately after the incision was made, to lift up his hand.\r\nThis is capped by the incident of Vesalius already given.\r\n\r\n“A correspondent of the late Dr. Hawes assures us that there was then\r\nliving in Hertfordshire a lady of an ancient and honourable family\r\nwhose mother was brought to life after interment by the attempt of a\r\nthief to steal a valuable ring from her finger. (See Reports of the\r\nRoyal Humane Society for 1787-88-89, p. 77.) Whether it was the same\r\nor not I cannot say, but Lady Dryden, who resided in the southern part\r\nof Northamptonshire, in consequence of some such event having occurred\r\nin her family expressly directed in her will that her body should\r\nhave the throat cut across previous to interment; and to secure this\r\nbequeathed fifty pounds to an eminent physician, who actually performed\r\nit.”--_Ibid., p. 106._\r\n\r\nDr. Elliotson refers to a case of a female who was pronounced to be\r\ndead. Her pulse could not be felt, and she was put into a coffin; and,\r\nas the coffin lid was being closed they observed a sweat break out, and\r\nthus saw that she was alive. She recovered completely, and then stated\r\nthat she had been unable to give any signs of life whatever; that she\r\nwas conscious of all that was going on around her; that she heard\r\neverything; and that when she found the coffin lid about to be put\r\non,the agony was dreadful beyond all description, so that it produced\r\nthe sweat seen by the attendants.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH-TRANCE.\r\n\r\nIn two cases related by the late Mr. Braid, of Manchester, “the\r\npatients remained in the horrible condition of hearing various remarks\r\nabout their death and interment. All this they heard distinctly\r\nwithout having the power of giving any indication that they were\r\nalive, until some accidental abrupt impression aroused them from their\r\nlethargy, and rescued them from their perilous situation. On one of\r\nthese occasions, what most intensely affected the feelings of the\r\nentranced subject, as she afterwards communicated to my informant,\r\nwas hearing a little sister, who came into the room, where she was\r\nlaid out for dead, exulting in the prospect, in consequence of her\r\ndeath, of getting possession of a necklace of the deceased.” In\r\nanother instance, the patient remained in a cataleptic condition for\r\nfourteen days. During this period, the visible signs of vitality were a\r\nslight degree of animal heat and appearance of moisture when a mirror\r\nwas held close to her face. But although she had no voluntary power\r\nto give indication by word or gesture, nevertheless she heard and\r\nunderstood all that was said and proposed to be done, and suffered the\r\nmost exquisite torture from various tests applied to her.... There is\r\nhardly a more interesting chapter in the records of medical literature\r\nthan the history of well-authenticated cases of profound lethargy or\r\ndeath-trance. Most of the reported cases in which persons in a state\r\nof trance are stated to have been consigned to the horrors of a living\r\nburial may possibly be apocryphal. Still, on the other hand, there are\r\nunquestionably too many well-substantiated instances of the actual\r\noccurrence of this calamity, the horrors of which no effort of the\r\nimagination can exaggerate, and for the prevention of which no pains\r\ncan be excessive and no precaution superfluous.\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from “Memorials of the Family of Scott, of\r\nScott’s Hall, in the County of Kent, with an Appendix of Illustrative\r\nDocuments,” by James Benat Scott, F. S. A., London, 1876, page 225:--\r\n\r\n“Robert Scott, Esq., tenth (but sixth surviving) son of Sir Thomas\r\nScott, of Scot’s-Hall, Knight, married Priscilla, one of the daughters\r\nof Sir Thomas Honywood, of Elmsmere, Knight, by whom he had nine\r\nchildren. Remarkable accidents happened to the said Robert Scott and\r\nPriscilla, his wife, before their marriage, at their marriage, and\r\nafter their marriage, before they had children. At their marriage,\r\nwhich was in or about the year 1610, the said Robert Scott having\r\nforgot his wedding ring when they were to be married, the said\r\nPriscilla was married with a ring with death’s head upon it.\r\n\r\n“Within a short time after they were married, the said Robert Scott,\r\nand Priscilla, his wife, sojourning with Sir Edward at Austenhanger,\r\nthe said Robert Scott, about Bartholomewtide, fell sick of a desperate\r\nmalignant fever, and was given over for dead by all, insomuch as that\r\nhe was laid forth, the pillows pulled from under him, the curtains\r\ndrawn, and the chamber windows set open, and ministers spoke to to\r\npreach the funeral service, and a book called for his funeral that was\r\nto have been kept at Scott’s Hall, where Sir John Scott the eldest\r\nbrother then lived. At night he was watched with by his own servant,\r\nnamed Robins, and another servant in the house, and about midnight\r\nthey, sitting together by the fire in the chamber, the said Robins said\r\nto the other, ‘Methinks my master should not be dead, I will go and\r\ntry,’ and presently starting up went to the bedside where his master\r\nlaid, and hallooed in his ear, and laid a feather to his nostrils, and\r\nperceived that he breathed, upon which he called them up in the house,\r\nand they warmed clothes and rubbed him, and brought him to life again.\r\nHe lived afterwards to be upwards of seventy-two years of age, and to\r\nhave nine children.\r\n\r\n“Another remarkable passage was that his wife, Priscilla, being then\r\nvery sick also, they told her that he was dead. She answered that she\r\ndid not believe that God would part them so soon. The said Priscilla,\r\nwhen born, was laid for dead, no one minding her, but all the women\r\nwent to help her mother, who was then like to die after her delivery;\r\nbut at last an old woman, taking the child in her arms, carried it\r\ndownstairs, and using means, brought her to life. The other women,\r\nmissing the child, and hearing the old woman had carried her down to\r\nget life in her, laughed at her, as thinking it impossible to bring the\r\nchild to life; but in a little time she brought it into the chamber, to\r\nthe amazement of them all, and said she might live to be an old woman;\r\nand so she did to the age of fifty-two, and had nine children.”\r\n\r\nThe following cases are from Mrs. Crowe’s “Night Side of Nature,” pp.\r\n133-136:--\r\n\r\n“Dr. Burns mentions a girl at Canton, who lay in a trance, hearing\r\nevery word that was said around her, but utterly unable to move a\r\nfinger. She tried to cry out, but could not, and supposed that she was\r\nreally dead. The horror of finding that she was about to be buried at\r\nlength caused a perspiration to appear on her skin, and she finally\r\nrevived. She described that she felt that her soul had no power to act\r\nupon her body, and that it seemed to be _in her body and out of it at\r\nthe same time_.”\r\n\r\n“Lady Fanshawe related the case of her mother who being sick of a\r\nfever, her friends and servants thought her deceased, and she lay in\r\nthat state for two days and a night; but Mr. Winslow, coming to comfort\r\nmy father, went into my mother’s room, and looking earnestly into her\r\nface, said, ‘She was so handsome, and looked so lovely, that he could\r\nnot think her dead,’ and, suddenly taking a lancet out of his pocket,\r\nhe cut the sole of her foot, which bled: upon this he immediately\r\ncaused her to be removed to the bed again, and she opened her eyes,\r\nafter rubbing and other restorative means, and came to life.”\r\n\r\n“On the 10th of January, 1717, Mr. John Gardner, a minister at Elgin,\r\nfell into a trance, and being to all appearances dead, he was put\r\ninto a coffin and on the second day was carried to the grave. But\r\nfortunately a noise being heard, the coffin was opened, and he was\r\nfound alive and taken home again, where, according to the record, ‘he\r\nrelated many strange and amazing things which he had seen in the other\r\nworld.’”\r\n\r\nUnder the head of “Suspended Animation: Cases of Recovery, etc.,” the\r\nReport of the Royal Humane Society for 1816-17, pp. 48-50, copies\r\nthe following:--“A young lady, an attendant on the Princess of----,\r\nafter having been confined to her bed for a great length of time with\r\na violent disorder, was at last to all appearances deprived of life.\r\nHer lips were quite pale, her face resembled the countenance of a dead\r\nperson, and her body became cold.\r\n\r\n“She was removed from the room in which she died, was laid in a\r\ncoffin, and the day of her funeral was fixed on. The day arrived,\r\nand, according to the custom of the country, funeral songs and hymns\r\nwere sung before the door. Just as they were about to nail on the lid\r\nof the coffin, a slight perspiration was observed to appear on the\r\nsurface of her body. It grew greater every moment, and at last a kind\r\nof convulsive motion was observed in the hands and feet of the corpse.\r\nA few moments after, during which time fresh signs of returning life\r\nappeared, she at once opened her eyes, and uttered a pitiable shriek.\r\nPhysicians were quickly procured, and in the course of a few days she\r\nwas considerably restored, and is probably alive at this day.”\r\n\r\nThe description which she herself gave of her situation is extremely\r\nremarkable, and forms a curious and authentic addition to psychology:--\r\n\r\n“She said it seemed to her, as if in a dream, that she was really\r\ndead; yet she was perfectly conscious of all that happened around her\r\nin this dreadful state. She distinctly heard her friends speaking,\r\nand lamenting her death at the side of her coffin. She felt them pull\r\non the dead-clothes and lay her in it. This feeling produced a mental\r\nanxiety which was indescribable. She tried to cry, but her soul was\r\nwithout power and could not act on her body. She had the contradictory\r\nfeeling as if she were in her body, and yet not in it, at one and the\r\nsame time. It was equally impossible for her to stretch out her arms,\r\nor to open her eyes, or to cry although she continued to do so. The\r\ninternal anguish of her mind was, however, at its utmost height when\r\nthe funeral hymns began to be sung, and when the lid of the coffin was\r\nabout to be nailed on. The thought that she was to be buried alive was\r\nthe first one which gave activity to her soul, and caused it to operate\r\non her corporeal frame.”\r\n\r\nRelated by Dr. Herz in the “Psychological Magazine,” and transcribed\r\nby Sir Alexander Crichton in the introduction to his essay on “Mental\r\nDerangement.” [2 vols., Lond., 1798.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“One of the most frightful cases extant is that of Dr. Walker, of\r\nDublin, who had so strong a presentiment on this subject, that he\r\nhad actually written a treatise against the Irish custom of hasty\r\nburial. He, himself, subsequently died, as was believed, of a fever.\r\nHis decease took place in the night, and on the following day he was\r\ninterred. At this time, Mrs. Bellamy, the once-celebrated actress, was\r\nin Ireland; and as she had promised him, in the course of conversation,\r\nthat she would take care he should not be laid in the earth till\r\nunequivocal signs of dissolution had appeared, she no sooner heard of\r\nwhat had happened than she took measures to have the grave reopened;\r\nbut it was, unfortunately, too late. Dr. Walker had evidently revived,\r\nand had turned upon his side; but life was quite extinct.”\r\n\r\nMr. Horace Welby, in a chapter on “Premature Interment,” says that “the\r\nRev. Owen Manning, the historian of Surrey, during his residence at\r\nCambridge University, caught small-pox, and was reduced by the disorder\r\nto a state of insensibility and apparent death. The body was laid out\r\nand preparations were made for the funeral, when Mr. Manning’s father,\r\ngoing into the chamber to take a last look at his son, raised the\r\nimagined corpse from its recumbent position, saying, ‘I will give my\r\npoor boy another chance,’ upon which signs of vitality were apparent.\r\nHe was therefore removed by his friend and fellow-student, Dr.\r\nHeberden, and ultimately restored to health.”--_The Mysteries of Life\r\nand Death, pp. 115-116._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA most conspicuous and interesting monument in St. Giles’s Church,\r\nCripplegate, London (where Cromwell was married and John Milton\r\nburied), is associated with a remarkable case of trance or catalepsy.\r\nIn the chancel is a striking sculptured figure in memory of Constance\r\nWhitney, a lady of remarkable gifts, whose rare excellences are fully\r\ndescribed in the tablet. She is represented as rising from her coffin.\r\nWelby, at p. 116, relates the story that she had been buried while\r\nin a state of suspended animation, but was restored to life through\r\nthe cupidity of the sexton, which induced him to disinter the body to\r\nobtain possession of a valuable ring left upon her finger, which he\r\nconcluded could be of no use to the wearer. A study of the facts of\r\npremature burial shows that the rifling of tombs and coffins to obtain\r\nvaluables has in other instances revealed similar tragic occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe often-cited case of Mrs. Goodman, one of those recalled to life by\r\nthe sexton’s attempt to remove a ring from the finger, is thus related\r\nin the “History of Bandon,” by George Bennett:--\r\n\r\nHannah, wife of Rev. Richard Goodman, vicar of Ballymodan, Bandon, from\r\n1692 to 1737, fell into ill-health, and apparently died. Two or three\r\ndays after her decease, the body was taken to Rosscarbery Cathedral,\r\nand there laid in the family vault of the Goodmans. The attempt of the\r\nsexton to recover a valuable diamond ring from the finger is said to\r\nhave been made at an early hour the next morning. Much violence was\r\nused, so that the corpse moved, yawned, and sat up. The sexton having\r\nfled in terror, leaving his lantern behind and the church door open,\r\nthe lady in her shroud made her way out of the vault and through the\r\nchurch to the residence of her brother-in-law, the Rev. Thomas Goodman,\r\nwhich was just outside the church-yard. Having been admitted after\r\nsome delay and consternation, she was put to bed, and fell asleep soon\r\nafter, her brother-in-law and his man-servant keeping watch over her\r\nuntil mid-day, when she awoke refreshed. She is said to have shown\r\nherself in the village in the afternoon, to have supped with the\r\nfamily in the evening, and to have set out for home on horseback next\r\nmorning. She is said to have survived this episode for some years, and\r\nto have borne a son subsequent to it, who died at an advanced age at\r\nInnishannon, a village near Bandon.\r\n\r\nIn Smith’s “History of Cork,” vol. ii., p. 428, the same incident is\r\nthus mentioned:--“Mr. John Goodman, of Cork, died in January, 1747,\r\naged about four score; but what is remarkable of him, his mother was\r\ninterred while she lay in a trance, having been buried in a vault,\r\netc.... This Mr. Goodman was born some time after.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Peckard, Master of Magdalen College, Cambridge, in a work entitled\r\n“Further Observations on the Doctrine of an Intermediate State,”\r\nmentions that Mrs. Godfrey, Mistress of the Jewel Office, and sister\r\nof the great Duke of Marlborough, is stated to have lain in a trance,\r\napparently dead, for seven days, and was declared by her medical\r\nattendants to have been dead. Colonel Godfrey, her husband, would not\r\nallow her to be interred, or the body to be treated in the manner of a\r\ncorpse; and on the eighth day she awoke, without any consciousness of\r\nher long insensibility.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Henry Laurens, of South Carolina, the first President\r\nof the American Congress during the Revolutionary War, died when young\r\nof small-pox. At all events a medical certificate pronounced her dead,\r\nand she was shrouded and coffined for interment. It was customary in\r\nthose days to confine the patient amidst red curtains with closed\r\nwindows. After the certificate of death had been duly made out, the\r\ncurtains were thrown back and the windows opened. The fresh air revived\r\nthe patient, who recovered and lived to a mature age. This circumstance\r\noccasioned on her father so powerful a dread of living interment, that\r\nhe directed by will that his body should be burnt, and enjoined on his\r\nchildren the performance of this wish as a sacred duty.\r\n\r\nBouchut in his “Signes de la Mort,” p. 58, relates that the physician\r\nof Queen Isabella of Spain was treating a man during a dangerous\r\nillness, and as he went to see his patient one morning he was informed\r\nby the assistants that the man had died. He entered, and found the\r\nbody, in the habit of the Order of St. Francis, laid out upon a board.\r\nNothing daunted, he had him put back to bed in spite of the ridicule of\r\nthose present, and the patient soon revived and fully recovered.\r\n\r\nThe following cases are from Köppen (see Bibliography, 1799):--\r\n\r\nVienna. 1791.--A castle guard (_portier_) was in a trance for several\r\ndays. His funeral was prepared, and he was placed in a coffin. All at\r\nonce he unexpectedly opened his eyes and called out, “Mother, where is\r\nthe coffee?”\r\n\r\nHalle, 1753.--In the register of deaths, at St. Mary’s Church, is the\r\nfollowing entry:--“Shoemaker Casper Koch was buried, aged eighty-one\r\nyears. Thirty years ago he had died, to all appearances, and was put in\r\na coffin, when suddenly, when they were about to bury him, he recovered\r\nhis consciousness.”\r\n\r\nHaag, Holland, 1785.--The son of a cook died, and while the coffin was\r\nbeing carried to the grave-yard, he was heard to knock. On opening the\r\ncoffin he was found alive. He was taken home and was restored.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the “Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine,” edited by John Forbes, M.D.,\r\nF.R.S., and others, 1847, vol. i., pp. 548-549, is the following:--“A\r\nremarkable instance of resuscitation after apparent death occurred\r\nin France, in the neighbourhood of Douai, in the year 1745, and is\r\nrelated by Rigaudeaux, (_Journal des Sçavans_, 1749,) to whom the\r\ncase was confided. He was summoned in the morning to attend a woman\r\nin labour, at a distance of about a league. On his arrival, he was\r\ninformed that she had died in a convulsive fit two hours previously.\r\nThe body was already prepared for interment, and on examination he\r\ncould discover no indications of life. The os uteri was sufficiently\r\ndilated to enable him to turn the child and deliver by the feet. The\r\nchild appeared to be dead also; but, by persevering in the means of\r\nresuscitation for three hours, they excited some signs of vitality,\r\nwhich encouraged them to proceed, and their endeavours were ultimately\r\ncrowned with complete success. Rigaudeaux again carefully examined the\r\nmother, and was confirmed in the belief of her death; but he found\r\nthat, although she had been in that state for seven hours, her limbs\r\nretained their flexibility. Stimulants were applied in vain; he took\r\nhis leave, recommending that the interment should be deferred until\r\nthe flexibility was lost. At five p.m. a messenger came to inform him\r\nthat she had revived at half-past three. The mother and child were both\r\nalive three years after.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nRESUSCITATION OF STILL-BORN AND OTHER INFANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE danger of premature burial of still-born (apparently dead) infants\r\nis clearly shown by the following quotation from Tidy’s “Legal\r\nMedicine,” part ii., page 253, from tables given on the authority\r\nof the _British and Foreign Medical Review_, No. ii., p. 235, based\r\non eight millions of births. “It would appear that from one in\r\neighteen to one in twenty births are still-born. Dr. Lever found that\r\nthe proportion in his three thousand cases was one in eighteen. So\r\nnotorious is it that a large number of these deaths could be averted,\r\nthat some legislation is urgently needed, requiring that still-borns,\r\nwhose bodies weigh, say, not less than two pounds (the average weight\r\nabout the sixth and seventh months at which children are viable),\r\nshould not be buried without registration and a medical examination.”\r\n\r\nMany instances can be found in current medical literature of still-born\r\ninfants that have been revived by artificial respiration. Such cases\r\nnot infrequently revive without any means being employed for their\r\nresuscitation; but among the poor, who dispose of the new-born\r\napparently dead in a hasty manner, they might be buried alive through\r\ncarelessness. The use of mortuaries, where the seeming dead would be\r\nkept under observation until decomposition appears, would of course\r\nprevent such disasters.\r\n\r\nStruve, in the Essay cited in the Bibliography (1802), says:--\r\n\r\n“All still-born children should be considered as only apparently dead,\r\nand the resuscitative process ought never to be neglected. Sometimes\r\ntwo hours or more will elapse before reanimation can be effected. An\r\ningenious man-midwife, says Bruhier, was employed for several hours in\r\nthe revival of an apparently still-born child, and as his endeavours\r\nproved unavailing, he considered the subject really dead. Being,\r\nhowever, accidentally detained, he again turned his attention to the\r\nchild, and by continuing the resuscitative method for some time it was\r\nunexpectedly restored to life” (p. 150).\r\n\r\nThe following is one of Struve’s most striking cases:--\r\n\r\nA Mr. E.---- called in 18---- to obtain a certificate of death for a\r\nstill-born child of seven months’ gestation. Arriving at the house,\r\nthe doctor found the child laid upon a little straw and covered with\r\na slight black shawl; this was one p.m., and the child had been there\r\nsince five a.m. It was icy cold, and there was no heart sound nor\r\nrespiration, but there was a slight muscular twitching over the region\r\nof the heart. The child was immersed in a hot bath and artificial\r\nrespiration employed, but for twenty minutes the case seemed hopeless;\r\nthen the eyes opened and after continued effort the respirations began,\r\nlaborious and interrupted at first, then normal by degrees. The child\r\nwas saved, and became an accomplished violinist.\r\n\r\nThe mortality and waste of infant life, particularly in large cities\r\nlike Paris, London, Berlin, Vienna, and New York, is admitted by all\r\ninvestigators to be enormous. In France medical writers, in view of\r\nthe small percentage of births to population, are waking up to the\r\nrealisation that the State cannot afford the loss, and that, among\r\nother things, steps should be taken to resuscitate the still-born,\r\nso that none should be buried before unequivocal signs of death are\r\nmanifested.[21] The premature abandonment of the still-born among the\r\npoorer classes in crowded cities is only too probable. There are also\r\ncases recorded which show a corresponding risk to infants who have\r\nsurvived their birth:--\r\n\r\nThe _British Medical Journal_, January 21, 1871, p. 71, gives the\r\nfollowing case, under the heading, “Alive in a Coffin”:--“Stories of\r\nthis kind are generally very apocryphal; but the following reaches us\r\nfrom an authentic source. A child narrowly escaped being buried alive\r\nlast week in Manchester. The infant’s father had died, and was to be\r\nburied in Ardwick Cemetery. The day before the burial the infant was\r\ntaken ill, and apparently died. A certificate of death was procured\r\nfrom a surgeon’s assistant who had seen the child, and, to save\r\nexpense, it was decided to place it in the same coffin with the father.\r\nThis was done, and the next morning the bearers set off to the cemetery\r\nwith their double burden; but before reaching the grave-yard a cry was\r\nheard to issue from the coffin. The lid being removed, the infant was\r\ndiscovered alive and kicking. It was at once removed to a neighbour’s\r\nhouse, but died eight hours afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe _British Medical Journal_, 1885, ii., p. 841, gives the following\r\ncase, under the heading, “Death or Coma?”\r\n\r\n“The close similarity which is occasionally seen to connect the\r\nappearance of death with that of exhaustion following disease, was\r\nlately illustrated in a somewhat striking manner. An infant seized with\r\nconvulsions was supposed to have died about three weeks ago at Stamford\r\nHill. After five days’ interval, preparations were being made for its\r\ninterment, when, at the grave’s mouth, a cry was heard to come from the\r\ncoffin. The lid was taken off, and the child was found to be alive; it\r\nwas taken home, and is recovering.”\r\n\r\nThe following is from Tidy’s “Legal Medicine,” pt. i., p. 29:--\r\n\r\n“In a communication to the French Academy, Professor Fort mentions\r\na child (_ætat._ three) having been resuscitated by artificial\r\nrespiration continued for four hours, and not commenced until three and\r\na half hours after its apparent decease.\r\n\r\n“Ogston records one case of a child alive for seven hours, and a second\r\ncase of a young woman alive for four hours, after they had been left as\r\ndead.”\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lancet_, April 22, 1882, p. 675:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“PREMATURE INTERMENT.\r\n\r\n “A daily contemporary states that at the gates of the Avignon cemetery\r\n the parents of a child certified to have died of croup insisted on\r\n having the coffin opened to take a last look. The child was found\r\n breathing, and is expected to be saved.”\r\n\r\nThe following letter to the editor of the _Lancet_, March 31, 1866, p.\r\n360, illustrates the danger to which infants supposed to be dead are\r\nexposed, under one of our traditional customs:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“LAYING-OUT OF DEAD INFANTS.\r\n\r\n “Sir,--In your journal of last Saturday, among the ‘Medical\r\n Annotations,’ you notice the inquiry into the circumstances under\r\n which an infant, being still living and moving, was ‘bandaged’\r\n beneath the chin, and ‘laid-out’ at St. Pancras Workhouse. Allow me\r\n to state that in the _Lancet_, vol. ii., 1850, a contribution from me\r\n ‘On the Danger of Tying-up the Lower Jaw immediately after Supposed\r\n Death’ was published. An infant, aged two months, was brought to me\r\n on a Friday with the lower jaw tied up by its mother, who asked for a\r\n certificate of death; but on my removing the bandage, the child began\r\n to show symptoms of vitality, and it lived until the following Monday.\r\n\r\n  C. J. B. ALDIS, M.D., F.R.C.P.\r\n\r\n “Chester Terrace, Chester Square, March 26, 1866.”\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that Dr. Doddridge showed so little signs of life at\r\nhis birth that he was laid aside as dead, but one of the attendants\r\nobserving some signs of life, took the baby under her charge, and by\r\nher judicious treatment perfectly restored it.\r\n\r\nMr. Highmore, Secretary of the London Lying-in Hospital, confirmed\r\n(by a communication to the Royal Humane Society, April, 1816,) the\r\nstatement of Mrs. Catherine Widgen, the matron of that excellent\r\nestablishment, that, by a zealous perseverance in the means recommended\r\nby that Society, she had been the happy instrument of restoring from\r\na state of apparent death in the space of _three years_ no less than\r\nforty-five infants, who, but for her humane attention and indefatigable\r\nexertions, must have been consigned to the grave. Later on, Mrs. Widgen\r\nrestored in one year twenty-seven apparently dead-born children--a\r\nstriking instance of the truth of the remark of a celebrated writer\r\n(Osiander) that “the generality of infants, considered as still-born,\r\nare only apparently so; if, therefore, persons would persevere in their\r\nexertions to revive them, most of them might be restored.”--_Report of\r\nthe Royal Humane Society, 1816-17, pp. 52-54._\r\n\r\n“For these exertions the General Court adjudged the Honorary Medallion\r\nto Mrs. Widgen, and it was accordingly presented to her by His Royal\r\nHighness the Duke of Kent.”--_Ibid., p. 52._\r\n\r\n[The question naturally suggests itself in this place: If the matron\r\nof such a noble institution as the above was able to save seventy-two\r\napparently dead children from the grave in four years, how many of\r\nthese poor little beings are consigned to the grave all over the world\r\nfor lack of the “humane attention and indefatigable exertions,” such as\r\nthis skilful matron gave to those that came under her intelligent care?]\r\n\r\n\r\n“RECURRENCE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION.\r\n\r\n“A child, who had a cough for some time, was suddenly attacked with\r\ndifficulty of breathing, and _to all appearances died_. A medical\r\ngentleman immediately inflated the lungs, and by persisting in this\r\nfor a considerable time, recovered the child. A similar state of\r\nsuspended animation took place three or four times, and inflation\r\nwas as often had recourse to with the same success; but the attack,\r\nhappening, unfortunately, to recur whilst the medical gentleman in\r\nwhose family the case happened was from home, the proper measures were\r\nnot taken, and the child was lost.”--_Ibid., p. 140._\r\n\r\n\r\n“SHOCK FROM LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\n“A boy was struck down by a flash of lightning near Hoxton (in the\r\nsuburbs of London), and lay exposed to the rain at least an hour, until\r\nhis companions carried him home on some boards, apparently dead--the\r\nbody being stiff and universally cold, the fingers and toes contracted,\r\nand the countenance livid. He was stripped of his wet clothes, put in\r\nhot blankets, and bled twenty ounces. In half an hour, interrupted\r\nrespiration commenced, without inflating the lungs; in an hour more,\r\nregular pulsation and breathing were established, together with power\r\nof swallowing; and in a week he was quite well.”--_Ibid., p. 147._\r\n\r\nIn the _Lancet_, 1884, vol. i., p. 922, W. Arnold Thompson, F.R.C.S.I.,\r\nreports a case of resuscitation of a child delivered by the forceps,\r\nwhich was “apparently to myself [he says] and the nurse and relatives,\r\na perfectly dead child, and with no signs of respiration or life about\r\nit.... My opinion was that the death was real and positive, but that,\r\nthere being no actual disease present, and the blood still warm, the\r\nmachinery of life was set going, and resuscitation followed as a\r\nconsequence of suitable means being taken and persevered in without\r\nundue delay. In the future I do not intend to allow any still-born\r\nchildren to be put away without making strenuous efforts to restore\r\nvitality.”\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_, 1880, vol. ii., p. 582:--In a discussion at the Royal\r\nMedical and Chirurgical Society upon Artificial Respiration in New-born\r\nChildren, Dr. Roper related three cases in which the child was left\r\nfor dead. “One of these occurred in the practice of Mr. Brown, of St.\r\nMary Axe. The child was still-born in the absence of a medical man. It\r\nwas taken to the surgery, and thence to the late Mr. Solly, who next\r\nday, in dissecting the body, found that the heart was still beating.\r\nA second instance was of a fœtus of five months and a half, which was\r\nset aside as dead, Dr. Roper attending the mother, who was suffering\r\nfrom hæmorrhage. He was astonished next day to find that this immature\r\nchild, which had lain on the floor for eleven hours through a cold\r\nnight, was breathing and its heart beating....” Such examples show that\r\nthe new-born have greater tenacity of life than is supposed.\r\n\r\nThe _Lancet_, 1881, vol. ii., p. 430, under the heading of “The\r\nBurial of Still-born Infants,” states that “Greater security for the\r\ndue observance of these necessary regulations (the Births and Deaths\r\nRegistration Act of 1874), for the burial of infants said to be\r\nstill-born, is urgently called for. It is constantly patent that the\r\nburial of deceased infants as still-born, if checked, is by no means\r\nprevented; and that the authorities of burial grounds, by their laxity\r\nin carrying out the provisions of the Act, afford dangerous facilities\r\nfor the concealment of crime, or negligence, and for a practice which\r\nthreatens to impair the value of our birth and death registration\r\nstatistics; for, if a live-born infant be buried as still-born, neither\r\nits birth nor its death is registered.”\r\n\r\nA case of forceps-delivery occurred in the hands of the writer\r\n(E.P.V.), in which the child, when extracted, was quite purple in\r\ncolour, and absolutely dead to all appearances--there was no breathing\r\nnor impulse to be found anywhere. After some efforts at resuscitation\r\nin the way of artificial respiration--not very thoroughly done, nor\r\nmuch prolonged (for the child was believed to be dead)--with a warm\r\nbath and frictions, it was laid aside and covered up. At a subsequent\r\nvisit some hours later, the child was found in the nurse’s lap,\r\ncompletely recovered, and changed in colour to a bright pink. The nurse\r\nsaid she did not like to give the little fellow up, and by breathing\r\ninto his mouth for some time he showed returning life, and by keeping\r\nit up he soon began to breathe himself.\r\n\r\nCases like this are believed to be not infrequent, because physicians\r\nand nurses are not, as a general rule, aware of the great tenacity of\r\nlife possessed by the new-born infant.\r\n\r\n“_Still-births_ are not registered in England; but, under the\r\nnew Registration Act, no still-born child can be buried without\r\na certificate from a registered practitioner in attendance, or\r\na declaration from a midwife, to the effect that the child was\r\nstill-born. The proportion of still-births in this country is supposed\r\nto be about four per cent., but this is uncertain.”--A. NEWSHOLME,\r\n_Vital Statistics, 1889, p. 61_.\r\n\r\n“The proportion of deaths from premature births, compared with the\r\ntotal number of births, in 1861-65 was 11·19 to 1,000 births; since\r\nwhich time it has steadily increased, reaching the ratio of 15·89 per\r\nbirths in 1,000 in 1887.”--_Ibid., p. 216._\r\n\r\nThe same author, p. 17, states that “a certain proportion of the\r\n_births remain unregistered_(_a_). There is strong reason for thinking\r\nthat a certain number of children born alive are buried as still-born.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\nRECOVERY OF THE DROWNED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS is perhaps the best known and most generally appreciated occasion\r\nof rescuing the apparently dead. The high degree in which it has\r\nexcited public sympathy will appear from a glance at that section of\r\nthe “Bibliography” (towards the end of the eighteenth century) which\r\ngives the titles of essays and reports connected with the Royal Humane\r\nSociety and the corresponding foreign institutions upon which our own\r\nwas modelled. The following general remarks and cases are from the\r\nessay of Dr. Struve, of Görlitz, Lusatia, 1802:--\r\n\r\n“A great number of persons apparently drowned have been restored\r\nto life without the use of stimulants, merely by the renovated\r\nsusceptibility of irritation. I have collected thirty-six cases of\r\npersons apparently drowned in Lusatia from the year 1772 to the year\r\n1792. Most of them were treated by uninformed people, and revived by\r\nfriction and warming; two persons, however, were indebted for their\r\nlives to the continuation of the resuscitative process for several\r\nhours. The greatest number were children; which is to be ascribed not\r\nonly to the greater danger to which they are exposed of drowning, but\r\nalso to the longer continuance of vital power in the infant frame” (p.\r\n136).\r\n\r\n“A boy of about a year and a half old had lain upwards of a quarter\r\nof an hour in the water, and was found face downwards, and the whole\r\nbody livid and swollen. He was undressed, wiped dry, and wrapped in\r\nwarm blankets; but the most particular part of the process was rolling\r\nthe body upon a table, shaking it by the shoulders, and rubbing the\r\nfeet. This having been continued for an hour, a convulsive motion\r\nwas observed in the toes; sneezing was excited by snuff; the tongue\r\nstimulated by strong vinegar; the throat irritated with a feather; an\r\ninjection given. The child vomited a large quantity of water, and in an\r\nhour afterwards began to breathe, and was completely restored to life”\r\n(p. 137).\r\n\r\n“A woman upwards of thirty years of age, and who was affected with\r\nepilepsy, fell in a fit from a height of twenty feet into the water,\r\nwhere she remained a full quarter of an hour before she was taken out.\r\nMr. Redlich, surgeon, of Hamburg, had her put into a bed warmed by hot\r\nbottles; she was rubbed with warm flannels, some spirits were dropped\r\ninto her mouth, when in a quarter of an hour symptoms of life, such as\r\nconvulsive motion and a very weak pulse, appeared. In three hours from\r\nthe time she was taken out of the water she recovered completely” (p.\r\n138).\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Londe, in a remarkable pamphlet (“Lettre sur la Mort\r\nApparente, les Conséquences Réelles des Inhumations Précipitées, et\r\nle Temps Pendent lequel peut persister l’Aptitude à étre Rapellé à la\r\nVie.” Paris, Bailliére, 1854), records some instances of narrow escapes\r\nfrom premature burial of the drowned, one of which may be cited:--\r\n\r\n“On the 13th of July, 1829, about two p.m., near the Pont des Arts,\r\nParis, a body, which appeared lifeless, was taken out of the river.\r\nIt was that of a young man, twenty years of age, dark-complexioned,\r\nand strongly built. The corpse was discoloured and cold; the face and\r\nlips swollen and tinged with blue; a thick and yellowish froth exuded\r\nfrom the mouth; the eyes were open, fixed, and motionless; the limbs\r\nlimp and drooping. _No pulsation of the heart nor trace of respiration\r\nwas perceptible._ The body had remained under water for a considerable\r\ntime; the search for it, made in Dr. Bourgeois’s presence, lasted\r\nfully twenty minutes. That gentleman did not hesitate to incur the\r\nderision of the lookers-on by proceeding to attempt the resuscitation\r\nof what, in their eyes, was a mere lump of clay. Nevertheless, several\r\nhours afterwards, the supposed corpse was restored to life, thanks to\r\nthe obstinate perseverance of the doctor, who, although a strong man\r\nand enjoying robust health, was several times on the point of losing\r\ncourage and abandoning the patient in despair. But what would have\r\nhappened if Dr. Bourgeois, instead of persistently remaining stooping\r\nover the inanimate body, with watchful eye and _attentive ear_, to\r\ncatch the first rustling of the heart, had left the drowned man, after\r\nhalf an hour’s fruitless endeavour, as often happens? The unfortunate\r\nman would have been laid in the grave, _although capable of restoration\r\nto life_!”\r\n\r\nTo this case, Dr. Bourgeois, in the “Archives de Medecine,” adds\r\nothers, in which individuals remained under water as long as SIX HOURS,\r\nand were recalled to life by efforts which a weaker conviction than his\r\nown would have refrained from making. These facts lead Dr. Londe to the\r\nconclusion that, _every day, drowned individuals are buried, who, with\r\ngreater perseverance, might be restored to life_!\r\n\r\nThe following case in point appears in the _Sunnyside_, New York,\r\ncommunicated by J. W. Green, M.D.:--\r\n\r\n“A few years since I was walking by the Central Park, near One Hundred\r\nand Tenth Street and Fifth Avenue. Noticing a crowd that was acting in\r\nan unusual manner by the side of the lake, I approached and inquired of\r\none of the bystanders what was the cause of the excitement. He replied,\r\n‘A boy is drowned.’ I advanced to the edge of the water, and saw two\r\nor three men in the water searching for the body. As they had not yet\r\ndiscovered it, I made enquiries, and found at last a small boy who had\r\nbeen a comrade of the victim. He showed me the spot from which the boy\r\nhad fallen. I then pointed out to the searchers where to look, and\r\nimmediately the body was recovered. I took it at once from the hands of\r\nthe person who had it, and held it reversed, in order to disembarrass\r\nit of all the water possible, for a minute or two, then stripped it of\r\nits clothing, sent for a blanket and brandy. I took a woollen coat from\r\none of the bystanders until the blanket should arrive, laid the child\r\nupon it and commenced to rotate it. This I continued to do for at least\r\nfifteen minutes by the watch. I then tried auscultation; no murmur\r\ncould be heard.\r\n\r\n“The skin was cold, the lips were blue. Every artery was still. With\r\nall these signs of death present it was still obligatory upon me to\r\npersevere. At the end of fifteen minutes there was a slight gasp. A\r\nsmall quantity of brandy was placed upon the tongue. A little of this\r\nran into the larynx, and the stimulation was sufficient to produce\r\na long inspiration and then a cough. This was more than a half-hour\r\nfrom the time when the boy had been removed from the water. Complete\r\nrestoration did not occur until nearly an hour from that time. He was\r\nnow given to his mother, and I was informed on the following day that\r\nhe entirely recovered, without an unfavourable symptom.”\r\n\r\nThe three following cases of resuscitation from apparent death by\r\ndrowning are copied from the most recent reports of the Royal Humane\r\nSociety, London:--\r\n\r\n“On 13th of August, 1895, Samuel Lawrence, aged five years, while\r\nplaying on the bank of a disused clay-pit at South Bank, Yorkshire,\r\nfell into the water and sank. Two of his companions dived into the\r\nwater, and brought him up after a submersion of from seven to ten\r\nminutes in an unconscious state. Two working men commenced artificial\r\nrespiration, and Dr. Steele continued it for ten hours before the boy\r\nshowed signs of returning sensibility and his complete recovery.”\r\n\r\n“October 6th, 1895.--At Deptford, Surrey, a woman with a baby in her\r\narms threw herself into the canal. They were rescued by the Royal\r\nHumane Society’s drags. Two ladies took possession of the bodies (time\r\nof submersion not stated), and they employed Silvester’s system of\r\nartificial respiration with success, in the case of the woman in about\r\none hour, and with the child one hour and a half.”\r\n\r\n“August 6th, 1895.--At Bradford, England, Rudolf Pratt, a clerk\r\nwith Midland R.R. Company, was bathing, and sank in deep water. A\r\nbystander by diving brought him up. After a submersion of five minutes,\r\nunconscious, and not breathing, Dr. Oldham restored respiration by\r\nSylvester’s method after one and a half hour’s treatment.”\r\n\r\nThese three cases are instructive on account of the length of time\r\nanimation remained suspended before it could be aroused to a state of\r\nactivity; and they lead to the belief that many cases that are given up\r\nas actually dead could be saved if efforts at resuscitation were kept\r\nup for a lengthened period, as in the first case.\r\n\r\nIn cases of drowning some persons are quickly revived after a long\r\nsubmersion; others again who are under water only a short time require\r\nartificial respiration for a long time before they show signs of\r\nreturning life, as was the case with Samuel Lawrence, who was submerged\r\nonly ten minutes, yet required ten hours’ active treatment to revive\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS ADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHASTY BURIALS.\r\n\r\nAS an illustration of hasty burials dealt with in Chapter X.\r\nthe following case is cited from the _King’s County Chronicle_,\r\nParsonstown, Ireland, August 27, 1896:--\r\n\r\n\r\n“ROSCREA GUARDIANS.\r\n\r\n“Thursday--Present: T. Jackson, D.V.C., in the chair; L. S. Maher,\r\nJ.P.; M. Bergin, J.P.; W. J. Menton, W. Jackson, P. Roe.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Roe--You made short work of Jack Ryan at the chapel of Knock. He\r\nwas alive and speaking at three o’clock, and buried at six the same\r\nday. The Master stated that, it being supposed the man died from an\r\ninfectious disease, no person would assist in coffining him till a\r\nmessage came asking that he (the Master) would send out some of the\r\nmale inmates, and he sent two and had him coffined and interred. Mr.\r\nRoe--The man was not cold when he was buried. Master--The nun tells\r\nme the man had an ounce of tobacco clasped tightly in his hands.\r\nChairman--What disease had he? Clerk--Pneumonia was certified by\r\nthe doctor. The people believed that he had died from an infectious\r\ndisease, and insisted he should be buried immediately. Mr. Roe--It was\r\ncertainly short work--a man dying at three o’clock and buried at six.\r\nMaster--This man was married to a woman who was a nurse in the old\r\nDonoughmore workhouse, and they lived at Drumar, Knock.”[22]\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF RESUSCITATIONS IN GRAVE-YARDS.\r\n\r\nReference has been made in this volume to the discoveries of premature\r\nburial brought to light during the investigations of charnel-houses\r\nin France, and the removal of grave-yards, necessitated through the\r\nrapid expansion of towns, in America. The _Casket_, Rochester, New\r\nYork, U.S., of March 2, 1896, gives a detailed narrative of recent\r\ndiscoveries made by T. M. Montgomery in the removal of Fort Randall\r\nCemetery, with the condition of the bodies found as to decay or state\r\nof preservation, and says:--\r\n\r\n“We found among these remains two that bore every evidence of having\r\nbeen buried alive. The first case was that of a soldier that had been\r\nstruck by lightning. Upon opening the lid of the coffin we found that\r\nthe legs and arms had drawn up as far as the confines of the coffin\r\nwould permit. The other was a case of death resulting from alcoholism.\r\nThe body was slightly turned, the legs were drawn up a trifle, and the\r\nhands were clutching the clothing. In the coffin was found a large\r\nwhisky flask, showing that those who buried him were not his friends,\r\nor else that they too were afflicted with the disease that had cut\r\nshort the life of their companion.\r\n\r\n“It occurred to us at that time that this was a great argument in\r\nfavour of incineration. Nearly two per cent. of those exhumed here\r\nwere, no doubt, victims of suspended animation. Once before in our\r\nexperience have we noted this; and while not believing in as large a\r\npercentage of live burials as the radical advocates of cremation claim,\r\nyet we know that the percentage is larger than most scientists give.\r\nDisinterment is the only solution of the question. In regard to these\r\ntwo cases, we wish to say that science has proved that electricity does\r\nnot always kill, and that persons addicted to the liquor habit, after\r\nlong debauches, sometimes relapse into a comatose state, and are to all\r\nappearances dead. Statistics show that a great many die annually of\r\nthese causes, hence the percentage in cases of this kind must be very\r\nlarge. What is the remedy?”\r\n\r\n\r\nHASTY EMBALMMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe _Casket_, Rochester, New York, September, 1896, observes:--At\r\ndifferent times considerable opposition has been raised against\r\nembalming by Boards of Health and other officials in various\r\nlocalities, on account of the haste with which the embalmer proceeds\r\nwith his duties. A few recent cases of supposed corpses recovering, one\r\nof which occurred in Philadelphia, Pa., have revived the question, and\r\nit is reported that the Philadelphia Board of Health may take action\r\nlooking to the enactment of a law prescribing the period of time which\r\nshould elapse after death before a body should be embalmed.\r\n\r\nIn a recent issue of the Philadelphia _Times_, Funeral-Director John J.\r\nO’Rourke, a well-known professional of that city, expresses himself on\r\nthe subject as follows:--\r\n\r\n“These two narrow escapes from burial alive have further impressed me\r\nwith one of the perils attending the disposition of the dead--I mean\r\nthe danger of hasty embalming. As you know, in most cases the doctor\r\nwho has had the patient is not called in after death, and very often\r\nthe relatives of the deceased expect the undertaker, if embalming is to\r\nbe done, to proceed with it at once. All the embalming schools teach\r\nthat the only proper way to thus treat the body is by use of fluids\r\nthrough the arteries. But in the lectures on the subject no period that\r\nshould be permitted to elapse before it is begun is prescribed, and, as\r\na rule, it follows dissolution as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\n“I contend that there should be some law or official rule governing\r\nthe matter, because after the artery is punctured and the fluid goes\r\nthrough the whole body, it is sure to destroy any spark of life that\r\nmight remain. I have never met with any cases of resuscitation myself,\r\nbut have had instances of deaths that made me hesitate in the work\r\nof embalming. Some months ago a man came to me fifteen minutes after\r\na relative had breathed his last, and asked me to embalm the body. I\r\nwent to the house, and, after seeing the corpse, refused, saying that\r\nI would not do it until after the expiration of twelve hours. The man\r\nhad died of consumption, yet, for fear of it being a case of suspended\r\nanimation, I would take no chances.\r\n\r\n“At another time a person had died of dropsy. Within half an hour I was\r\nsummoned. The attending physician had not been there, and twenty-four\r\nhours afterwards he gave a certificate of death from cancer. The body\r\nwas very warm when I arrived, and neighbours who had kindly volunteered\r\nto prepare it were doubtful if life was extinct. I had the corpse laid\r\non an embalming table for two hours, and then placed it in what is\r\nknown as a Saratoga patent box, in which are pans filled with salted\r\nice, so arranged that cold air circulates around the body. Had this\r\nbeen a case of suspended animation, it would have taken several hours\r\nto dispel the heat within the corpse.\r\n\r\n“Of course there are some supposed unmistakable signs. The only\r\npositive signs of dissolution are those which depend on molecular\r\nchange or death-rigidity of the muscles of the whole body, and\r\nputrefaction of the tissues. These are most marked in organs and\r\ntissues the vital functions of which are the most active. The action\r\nof the heart, the movements of respiration, may be reduced as to be\r\naltogether imperceptible, so that the functions of circulation and\r\nrespiration appear to be arrested. This is occasionally observed in\r\ntemporary syncope, in which a person to all appearances dead has, after\r\na time, regained consciousness and recovered.\r\n\r\n“The peculiar condition of the nervous system called catalepsy, and\r\nthe state of trance, are likewise further examples of the so-called\r\napparent deaths; but, on the occurrence of actual death, the\r\nirritability of the muscles by degrees disappears, electricity no\r\nlonger excites their contraction, and then cadaverous rigidity sets\r\nin.... Some action will, in all probability, be urged upon the next\r\nLegislature or upon the Board of Health.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF ORDINANCES, ETC., RELATING TO THE INSPECTION OF CORPSES AND\r\nOF INTERMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the sixteenth Council of Milan, Saint Charles Borromeo prohibited\r\nburials before twelve hours after ordinary cases of death, and\r\ntwenty-four hours after cases of sudden death. As early as the\r\nsixteenth century serious attention in the examination of the dead\r\nwas made obligatory by the enactment of Article 149 of the Criminal\r\nStatutes of Charles the Fifth. This was the foundation of legal\r\nmedicine in Germany. In France, a similar ordinance was first\r\nestablished in 1789.\r\n\r\n\r\nNETHERLANDS.\r\n\r\n_Act of April 10th, 1869._\r\n\r\nNo burial is allowed without the written permission of the Civil\r\nRecorder, granted upon the production of a certificate of a qualified\r\nphysician, and not until thirty-six hours have elapsed after death,\r\nnor later than the fifth day after death. But this regulation can be\r\nset aside, and a longer period allowed, by the Burgomaster, on the\r\napplication of a doctor.\r\n\r\nDead-houses are in use for bodies dead of infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKFORT-ON-THE-MAIN.\r\n\r\nDeath must first be established by a licensed physician, who carefully\r\nexamines the body for that purpose, and, if satisfied, then issues\r\na certificate which states the name, age, sex, place, and date, and\r\nimmediate cause of death. The certificate is taken within twenty-four\r\nhours after the death to the Standesamt, where the death is recorded,\r\nand a certificate to that effect is given, and presented to the\r\nCemetery Commission, which assigns the place of burial. The corpse is\r\nrequired to remain unburied three days, either at the place of death or\r\nat the mortuary, where it is under the observation of attendants; but\r\nthere is no State-appointed inspector of the dead, nor electric bells\r\nor other means for announcing and recording any movements of the body.\r\nThe system of inspection and certification by qualified physicians,\r\nwith the delay of three days, and the favourable condition of the\r\ndead-houses, have been the means of preventing the living from being\r\nmistaken for the dead in a number of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\nInterments must not take place, according to Article 77 of the Code\r\nNapoleon, before twenty-four hours of death, but in practice it is\r\ntwenty-four hours after death-notification by the _mort-verificateur_.\r\nDuring epidemics, or when deaths occur from infectious or contagious\r\ndiseases, the interments must invariably be made within twenty-four\r\nhours of death.\r\n\r\nArticle 77 of the Civil Code states that “No burial shall take place\r\nwithout an authorisation, on free paper and without expense, of the\r\nofficer of the Civil State, who will not be empowered to deliver it,\r\nunless after having visited the deceased person, nor unless twenty-four\r\nhours after the decease, except in cases provided for by the\r\nregulations of the police.” It results from this that no corpse can be\r\nburied before a minimum delay of twenty-four hours shall have expired\r\nafter the decease. The formal record of the decease must be made by the\r\nofficer of the Civil State (the mayor), or, which is what takes place\r\nin most of the communes, by a medical man delegated by the mayor, and\r\nwho takes the title of medical officer of the Civil State.\r\n\r\nThe Article 77 of the Civil Code is generally strictly observed in\r\nParis and in other cities of France. The obligation to await the delay\r\nof twenty-four hours is intended to prevent too hasty burials. One\r\nconsiders, in fact, that that delay is generally necessary in order to\r\nbe able to have certain proofs of death.\r\n\r\nBy Article 358 of the Penal Code, the burial of a deceased person\r\nwithout such authorisation is punishable by a maximum period of two\r\nmonths’ imprisonment, and a maximum fine of fifty francs, without\r\nprejudice to other criminal proceedings which may be applicable under\r\nthe circumstances.\r\n\r\nExceptions, however, have been established in certain cases. For\r\nexample, in times of epidemics, or of too rapid decomposition of the\r\ncorpse in the usual case, there is urgent need, in fact, to bury the\r\nbody of a person attacked with a contagious or epidemic malady, in\r\norder to suppress one of the causes of propagation of the epidemic,\r\nor of the contagion. In the second case, it is understood that one\r\ncould not keep longer, without danger to the public health, a corpse\r\nin complete putrefaction. There is occasion also to observe that, in\r\nthese circumstances, the end which the legislator has proposed to\r\nhimself is equally obtained, since there cannot be any doubt as to the\r\nreal death. However that may be, it is the mayor (officer of the Civil\r\nState) to whom it appertains, according to the terms of the Article\r\n77 of the Civil Code, to give authority to bury; and if he gives that\r\nauthorisation before the expiration of the delay of twenty-four hours,\r\nit is after having established by himself, or by the medical officer\r\nof the Civil State, the fact of its necessity, resulting from the\r\ncircumstances of which we have just spoken.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that the Article 77 fixes a _minimum_ and _not a\r\nmaximum_ delay. It is always the mayor to whom it appertains to fix\r\nthe day and the hour of the burial, and there may happen such and such\r\na circumstance which necessitates a delay of the obsequies. The mayor\r\nneed only assure himself in that case that no danger will result to the\r\npublic health, which naturally is the case when the corpse is embalmed,\r\nor is placed in a leaden coffin.\r\n\r\nOutside Paris and other large cities, and especially in the rural\r\ndistricts, much laxity prevails both as to verification of death and\r\nthe time of burial, and cases of premature burial are not infrequent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\n\r\nThe laws relative to funerals and burials are very strict--perhaps the\r\nmost thorough in their requirements of any in Europe. They provide for\r\na very careful inspection of the body by medical inspectors, quite\r\nindependently of the attending physicians, in order to ascertain if the\r\ndeath be absolute. Minute and specific official directions guide them\r\nas to the method of examination and the signs of death to be looked\r\nfor. And they further provide for carrying out any particular method,\r\nas to which the deceased may have given directions, in order to prevent\r\na possible revival in the coffin. Should the surviving relatives\r\ndesire it, a _post-mortem_ operation may be made upon the body, in the\r\npresence of the medical inspectors and the police; in which case the\r\nheart is pierced through; and a full report of the operations must be\r\nforwarded to the civic magistrate. A fee of six florins is allowed for\r\nsuch an operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY OF VIENNA.\r\n\r\nEvery death to be inquired into by the municipal physician. The first\r\nof five objects is to ascertain whether the person be really dead.\r\nIn examining whether there are any remaining indications of life, he\r\nwill rely not upon any one sign, nor even upon putrefaction, but upon\r\nthe totality of the signs of death. If there are any indications of\r\nlife remaining, he must at once institute the means of resuscitation\r\napproved by science, and continue them until such time as the family\r\nmedical attendant is assured of their uselessness. If there be any\r\ndoubt as to the reality of the death, a second inspection of the body\r\nis to be made by the municipal physician within twenty-four hours.\r\nBurial, as a rule, is not to be until forty-eight hours after death;\r\nbut the interval may be shortened in cases of infectious diseases or of\r\nunusually rapid decomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVINCE OF DALMATIA.\r\n\r\n_Vice-Governor’s Order of 29th April, 1894._\r\n\r\nEvery death to be inquired into by the parish physician, or a deputy\r\nappointed by the mayor. The first of six objects of the inquest is\r\nto ascertain whether the person be really dead. In the event of a\r\nnon-medical examiner discovering signs of life, he is to send for a\r\ndoctor. Inasmuch as decomposition, the only sure sign of death, is, as\r\na rule, a phenomenon of later occurrence than the time appointed for\r\nthe inquest (within twelve hours of the notification of death), the\r\nexamining person must base his certainty of the extinction of life, not\r\nupon one sign, but upon the totality of the signs of death.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINGDOM OF SAXONY.\r\n\r\n_Law of 20th July, 1850._\r\n\r\nThe burial of a corpse must not take place until seventy-two hours\r\nafter death, and the signs of decomposition are clearly visible.\r\nAny proposed departure from this rule, in the event of earlier\r\nputrefaction, or the absence of decomposition at the end of\r\nseventy-two hours, requires the authority of a physician called in.\r\nBy the above Law, the following Orders are suspended: (1) the Order\r\nof 11th February, 1792, concerning the treatment of the dead, and\r\nthe precautions necessary to prevent the apparently dead from being\r\nburied prematurely; (2) the General Order of 13th February, 1801,\r\nconcerning precautionary measures in the burial of those dead of\r\ninfectious diseases; (3) the Law of 22nd June, 1841, together with the\r\nAdministrative Orders, concerning the examination of corpses and the\r\nestablishment of mortuaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITY OF MUNICH.\r\n\r\n_Order of 30th October, 1848._\r\n\r\nThe ordinance hitherto in force, as to making an incision in the\r\nsole of the foot in cases of patients who die in the hospitals, is\r\nabolished; the hospital physicians to use their discretion whether or\r\nnot the incision should be made; but, in cases for which is demanded\r\nan earlier burial than is usually prescribed, whether they have been\r\nhospital or private patients, the incision is to be made in the sole\r\nof the foot at the end of the second inspection, and every other means\r\ntaken to ascertain whether the death be apparent or real.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCUTTA.\r\n\r\n1. The prevailing custom for Christians and Mahomedans is to bury the\r\ndead. The Hindoos burn them as a rule, but many prefer to throw them\r\ninto a sacred river, particularly the Ganges or its tributaries, if\r\nthey can do so unmolested by the authorities.\r\n\r\n2. There are no mortuaries. The signs which are assumed to indicate\r\ndeath are the various conditions and appearances when animation is\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\n3. Cases of revival from supposed death are sometimes heard of among\r\nthe Hindoos, who regard such persons as outcasts. If the signs of\r\nreturning life are not very manifest when a person begins to revive,\r\nhe is sometimes killed by stuffing the mouth and nose with mud, which\r\ngenerally accomplishes the object.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBAY.\r\n\r\n1. There are no laws or regulations in India for the disposal of\r\nthe dead. The customs and formalities follow the traditions and\r\nrequirements of religious belief.\r\n\r\n _a._ The Hindoos burn their dead immediately after death takes place.\r\n\r\n _b._ The Parsees take their dead to a “Tower of Silence” as soon as\r\n death takes place, and, after certain prescribed ceremonies, the body\r\n is speedily devoured by vultures.\r\n\r\n _c._ The Europeans and Mahomedans bury their dead within from\r\n twenty-four to forty-eight hours, because putrefaction usually sets in\r\n soon after death on account of the heat and humidity of the climate.\r\n\r\n2. There are no mortuaries, excepting in connection with hospitals,\r\nwhere observations can be made.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPE TOWN, AFRICA.\r\n\r\n1. There are no laws nor regulations relative to the disposal of\r\nthe dead, excepting in cases requiring an inquest or _post-mortem_\r\nexamination. The custom is to bury within twenty-four to thirty hours\r\nafter death, but the time is sometimes extended to two or three days.\r\n\r\n2. There are no dead-houses, except at the hospitals, which are under\r\nthe management of the superintendent.\r\n\r\n3. The certificate of the medical attendant is sufficient for burial\r\npurposes. The complete cessation of respiration and the heart’s action\r\nare considered an absolute indication of death. When decomposition sets\r\nin, it usually appears within twenty-four hours after death, although\r\nin winter that process may be longer delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSCOW.\r\n\r\nOrthodox Russians keep their dead three days before burial. During that\r\ntime the body lies with the face uncovered, and a deacon chants and\r\nprays over it twice a day. A medical certificate of death is imperative\r\nbefore burial.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS.\r\n\r\nBurials are regulated by the Communal Council in accordance with law.\r\nThe system is complicated, but thorough. The medical men connected with\r\nthe Government Medical Service (“Doctors of the Civil Government”) have\r\nthe sole control of the examinations of deaths, as well as births,\r\naccidents, sudden deaths, suicides; and attend to burials, autopsies,\r\npostponements of burials, etc., on their own motion. Interments usually\r\ntake place within forty-eight hours of death, but they may be carried\r\nout sooner during epidemics for the public safety.\r\n\r\nThere are mortuaries in the city and suburbs, to which bodies may\r\nbe taken at the request of surviving relatives, or by the order of\r\nthe health authorities, according to private necessities or for the\r\npublic safety. Except by the special authorisation of the officers of\r\nthe civil government, bodies cannot remain in the mortuaries longer\r\nthan forty-eight hours; and a burial cannot take place in less than\r\ntwenty-four hours. Special care is taken to test the reality of\r\ndeath in still-born infants, and efforts are made to revive them, as\r\nwell as all other cases of seeming death. In cases of women dying\r\nduring advanced pregnancy, the infant must be roused by artificial\r\nrespiration, in order to restore animation if possible. The process\r\nfor obtaining a delay for burial is intricate and cumbersome, and to a\r\nforeigner unaccustomed to the language and the local usages the chances\r\nwould be against securing such a permit before the time allowed for\r\nburial had transpired.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENMARK.\r\n\r\nMortuaries are connected with all the churches, cemeteries, and some\r\nof the hospitals, and are growing in favour in the country places; but\r\nas yet they are unprovided with any appliances for the resuscitation\r\nof the apparently dead, or for the prevention of premature burials.\r\nNo corpse, however, is allowed to be taken to a mortuary before it\r\nhas been inspected, and a death-certificate issued by a qualified\r\nphysician; but, when this is done, death is considered absolute. No\r\ncorpse is allowed to remain in any church, chapel, or mortuary longer\r\nthan seven days after supposed death, without special permission.\r\nCoffins that contain bodies which have died from infectious diseases\r\nmust be so indicated, and cannot be opened in the mortuaries.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, bodies are kept seventy-two hours before burial. The signs\r\nthat are considered sufficient to establish death are the glazed\r\nappearance of the eyes, livid spots on the skin, and muscular rigidity.\r\nIn doubtful cases, the time before burial can be extended by authority\r\nof the Board of Health, of which the Police Director is a member.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN.\r\n\r\nBurials usually do not take place until twenty-four hours after death.\r\nFor example, if a death takes place about four p.m., the burial is\r\nmade late in the following afternoon. In time of epidemic, bodies are\r\nhurried to the cemeteries, where depositories are provided, which\r\nare under the care of watchers until the expiration of twenty-four\r\nhours after death. The certificate of a reputable physician as to\r\ndeath is sufficient to authorise burial. Relatives or friends usually\r\nremain with the body until burial, excepting in cases when judicial\r\nproceedings are held over it to determine the circumstances of the\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRELAND.\r\n\r\nThere are no laws in Ireland regarding the disposal of the dead, but\r\nthe Sanitary Acts of the United Kingdom can be applied in any case\r\nwithin a reasonable period, on the ground of public health. There is\r\nno fixed period for keeping a body before burial. The Roman Catholics\r\nusually bury on the third or fourth day after death; but in some\r\ndistricts custom sanctions burial within twenty-four or thirty-six\r\nhours. Local burial authorities sometimes require a medical certificate\r\nbefore burial, but, there being no legal obligation for it, this is\r\noften omitted. In cases of suicide, sudden death, or death by violence,\r\nthe Coroner holds an inquest, and gives a certificate accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere are no dead-houses in Ireland, where bodies may be observed for a\r\nperiod of time before burial.\r\n\r\nConcerning burials in England, see Glen’s “Burial Acts” for the general\r\nburial practice; also “Regulations for Wilton Cemetery.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nIn the United States of America, as a rule, everything relative to\r\nthe disposal of the dead is regulated by local Boards of Health,\r\nas authorised by State laws. A burial cannot take place without a\r\ncertificate from a legally licensed physician, which must state the\r\ncause of death; the place and time when it occurred; the full name;\r\nage; sex; colour; occupation; birth-place; names and birth-places\r\nof both parents. There are no laws or regulations that require the\r\ninspection of the body to verify the fact of death (the certificate,\r\nas in England, as to the cause is considered sufficient for this\r\npurpose), and no time is fixed when a body must, or must not, be\r\nburied. This is regulated by, and left to, the convenience of the\r\nfamily of the deceased, by the season of the year, by the opinion of\r\nthe attending physician, etc. But the Health Officers can order the\r\nburial whenever, in their opinion, the public health requires it. As a\r\nrule, burials after supposed death are made sooner in the South, and\r\namong the poor, than in the North, and among the well-to-do classes. In\r\nremote unsettled regions burials not seldom take place without these\r\nformalities, and they are often carried out in a hasty manner; but\r\nusually they do not take place till three days after supposed death,\r\nand sometimes, particularly in cold weather, a longer time is allowed.\r\nAll large cemeteries have chambers for the temporary deposit of bodies,\r\nbut they are not under observation, as it is taken for granted that\r\nthey are dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F.\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH PRACTICE OF EARLY BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nR. J. WUNDERBAR, in his standard work on “Biblisch-talmudische\r\nMedicin,” Riga and Leipzig, 1850-60, gives, in pp. 5-15 of the\r\nconcluding section (Abtheil. 4, Bd. ii.), the following summary of the\r\norigin of the peculiar Jewish practice of burying the corpse within a\r\nfew hours of death:--\r\n\r\nIn the Levitical law (Num. xix. 11-22) every dead body was an unclean\r\nthing, including those dead in the tent and on the battlefield.\r\nTouching a corpse involved purification and separation for seven days.\r\nThis ordinance is supposed to have had a sanitary motive, having\r\nprobably originated with cases of infectious disease. There is only\r\none Biblical ordinance as to early burial, and that is indubitably\r\nrestricted to persons executed for crime: Deut. xxi. 22, 23, “And if\r\na man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death,\r\nand thou hang him on a tree, his body shall not remain all night upon\r\nthe tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day (for he that is\r\nhanged is accursed of God), that thy land be not defiled which the Lord\r\nthy God giveth thee for an inheritance.”This statutory limit to the\r\nexposure of the bodies of malefactors was the most convenient way of\r\nchecking the practice, common in other countries, of leaving corpses of\r\ncriminals to hang upon the gibbet until they rotted, or were consumed\r\nby birds of prey. Its motive was to prevent, by the promptest measure,\r\nan indefinite degree of neglect in altogether special cases.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing else in the Bible concerning early burial; on the\r\ncontrary, the patriarchal practice, in the case of eminent persons,\r\nseems to have been to keep the body for a considerable time above\r\nground, after the manner of Egypt. Prior to the Babylonian exile\r\nthere is not a trace of the later practice of speedy burial. The\r\npost-Talmudic custom had arisen entirely from a misunderstanding.\r\nIt is true that the Talmud enjoins that corpses--according to\r\ncircumstances--be kept unburied not longer than one day; but it also\r\npermits them to lie above ground for days, so that elaborate funeral\r\npreparations might be made, or time given for mourners to arrive from a\r\ndistance. Lastly, the Talmud relates the burial of one apparently dead\r\nwho revived and lived for twenty-five years, and begat five children;\r\nwhereupon a rabbinical ordinance was made that the corpse (which would\r\nhave been laid in a vault or in a tomb above ground) should be visited\r\ndiligently until three days after death. (The references to the Talmud\r\nare: Semachoth 8; Moedkaton 1, 6; Sabbat 151, 152; Sanhedrin 46a.)\r\n\r\nWunderbar admits that there had been cases of premature burial\r\namong the Jews, but he asserts their extreme rarity, and doubts the\r\nauthenticity of most of the traditional or historical cases in general.\r\n\r\nIn Jewish circles in Germany towards the end of last century there\r\nwas much controversy as to the inexpediency of the practice of early\r\nburial. In the “Berlinische Monatschrift” for April, 1787, p. 329,\r\n(cited by Marcus Herz, “Ueber die frühe Beerdigung der Juden,” Berlin,\r\n1788, p. 6,) there is printed a letter from Moses Mendelssohn to the\r\nJews of Mecklenburg, in which he advises them to keep their dead\r\nunburied for three days. “I know well,” he adds, “that you will not\r\nfollow my advice; for the might of custom is great. Nay, I shall\r\nperhaps appear to you as a heretic on account of my counsel. All the\r\nsame, I have freed my conscience from guilt.”\r\n\r\nThe above-cited essay by Dr. Marcus Herz, of Berlin, arguing against\r\nthe Jewish practice, called forth a reply by Dr. Marx, of Hanover, who\r\nwas of opinion that the burial might safely proceed after the body had\r\nbeen left on the bed for three hours, and had then been pronounced\r\nlifeless by the medical attendant, according to the practice in that\r\npart of the country. To that Dr. Herz rejoined, in a second edition,\r\nthat the medical attendant was no better judge than an ordinary man,\r\ninasmuch as all experimental tests were fallacious, and decomposition\r\nthe only sure sign. He cites the following statement by an experienced\r\nJewish physician, Dr. Hirschberg, of Königsberg (from the Jewish\r\nperiodical, “Sammler,” vol. ii., p. 153):--“I have practised medicine\r\nfor forty years, and have always grieved over the practice amongst us\r\nof too hasty burial of the dead--on the day of decease. It happened\r\nonce in my practice that a woman lay for dead three days and then awoke\r\nand revived. At first I would not allow the body to be moved from the\r\nbed, but the undertaker’s men violently resisted me, taking up the body\r\nand laying it on the ground. According to their custom, they would have\r\nburied it the same day, had I not earnestly called out to them: ‘Beware\r\nlest you do lay her in the ground this day! She is still alive, and the\r\nblame will be on you.’ I had her covered with warm, woollen clothes; on\r\nthe following morning some signs of life were manifest; she lay still,\r\nand gradually awoke out of her death-slumber.”\r\n\r\nHerz declared, as Wunderbar did subsequently, that the passages in the\r\nTalmud on which the Jewish custom was based had been misinterpreted;\r\nand he specially accused the rabbis Jacob Emden, of Altona, and\r\nEzechel, of Prague, of rabbinical subtilty on the one hand, and of a\r\nfallacious dependence upon scientific signs of death on the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the World’s Medical Congress (Division of Eclectic Medicine), held\r\nin Chicago, June 3, 1893, the following resolution was proposed by Dr.\r\nJohn V. Stevens, and adopted:--\r\n\r\n “Whereas we believe that many persons in the past, in the condition\r\n simulating death from various causes, have been buried alive;\r\n therefore,\r\n\r\n “Resolved--That it should be the duty of all Governments to pass laws\r\n prohibiting the burial of bodies without positive proofs of death;\r\n that the nature of these proofs should be taught in all schools and\r\n printed in all newspapers throughout the world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SEVENTEENTH CENTURY._\r\n\r\nKORNMANNUS (Henricus).

London: Swan Sonnenschein & Co. (One Shilling).\r\n\r\n[16] “Pour se convaincre de l’erreur où l’on tomberait en adoptant\r\ncette opinion populaire, il suffit de refléchir d’abord qu’un cercueil\r\nn’est pas exactement moulé sur les proportions du corps qu’il\r\ncontient; que, par consequent, tous les intervalles sont remplis d’air\r\nrespirable, en quantité très-grande, égale à-peu-près à un cube dont le\r\ncôté aurait 50 centimètres de hauteur. Or, chaque inspiration absorbe\r\nenviron 1,200 centimètres cubes d’air dont l’oxygène n’est employé dans\r\nl’hématose que pour sa cinquième partie, le reste étant rendu pendant\r\nl’expiration; il en resulte donc que chaque inspiration ne consomme en\r\nréalité que 240 centimètres cubes. L’homme, à l’état normal, respire\r\nà-peu-près 800 fois par heure; et, comme un cube de 50 centimètres de\r\ncôté contient 125,000 centimètres cubes, on doit conclure que cette\r\nquantité d’air peut suffire à 520 inspirations normales, c’est à dire à\r\nsoutenir la vie pendant près de trois quarts d’heure. Mais, d’un autre\r\ncôté, il est démontré, en botanique, que l’air filtre dans la terre;\r\ncelui contenu dans le cercueil peut donc en partie se renouveler. On\r\ndoit nécessairement tenir compte de la nature du terrain où le cercueil\r\nà été déposé; s’il est sec, léger ou sablonneux, il laissera pénétrer,\r\ncirculer pour, ainsi dire, l’air atmosphérique plus facilement, que\r\ndes terres humides, grasses ou argileuses. Ajoutons enfin, que les\r\nquantités determinées plus haut pourraient être réduites de plus de\r\nmoitié, sans causer directement la mort. On voit donc qu’un homme\r\npeut vivre sous terre pendant plusieurs heures, et que ce temps sera\r\nd’autant plus court que le sujet sera plus pléthorique, c’est-à-dire\r\npredisposé aux congestions cérébrales, puisque, dans ce cas, ses\r\ninspirations seront plus larges et plus frequentes.”\r\n\r\n[17] Report on “Suspended Animation.” By a Committee of the Royal Med.\r\nChirur. Society, July 12, 1862.\r\n\r\n[18] The _British Medical Journal_, August 15, 1894, p. 381, reports\r\na “Discussion on the Overcrowding of the Profession,” in which Dr.\r\nFrederick H. Alderson says:--“The very crowded condition of the medical\r\nprofession concerns a very large body of the profession; neither is the\r\nevil limited to any particular section of it. Our physicians are too\r\nnumerous, our surgeons alike too many, and our general practitioners\r\nare legion.”\r\n\r\n[19] Quoted by Dr. Franz Hartmann in “Premature Burial.”\r\n\r\n[20] Alas for the futility of human expectations of reform when left to\r\nthe initiation of Governments--this was written twenty-seven years ago,\r\nand nothing has been done to remedy the evil!\r\n\r\n[21] During the five years ending 1895 the population of France,\r\nwhere of all European countries premature burial is most in vogue,\r\nhas increased by only 133,819, or, leaving out the immigration of\r\nalien population, the increase is under 30,000. The population for all\r\npractical purposes may be regarded as stationary.\r\n\r\n[22] With reference to the burial customs in Ireland, the _Kings County\r\nChronicle_, Parsonstown, September 17, 1896, says:--“Young children are\r\nburied the day after death, but adults are waked for two, and sometimes\r\nthree nights.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE:\r\n\r\n--Obvious print and punctuation errors were corrected.",
