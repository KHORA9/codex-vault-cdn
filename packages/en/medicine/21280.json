D. WILSON\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL MEDICAL OFFICER TO THE SOUTH AFRICAN FIELD FORCE\r\n\r\nTHE MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS\r\nEMPLOYED IN SOUTH AFRICA\r\n\r\nAND TO THE\r\n\r\nCIVIL SURGEONS TEMPORARILY ATTACHED TO THAT CORPS\r\n\r\nThese Experiences are Dedicated\r\n\r\nAS AN EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION\r\nOF THE INVARIABLE KINDNESS AND SYMPATHY EXTENDED\r\nTO THE AUTHOR\r\nWITHOUT WHICH THE BOOK COULD NOT\r\nHAVE BEEN WRITTEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nA word of explanation is perhaps necessary as to the form in which these\r\nexperiences have been put together. The matter was originally collected\r\nwith the object of sending a series of articles to the _British Medical\r\nJournal_. Various circumstances, however, of which the chief was the\r\nfeeling that extending experience altered in many cases the views\r\nadopted at first sight, prevented the original intention from being\r\ncarried into execution, and the articles, considerably expanded, are now\r\npublished together.\r\n\r\nAs to the illustrative cases introduced in support of various statements\r\nmade in the text, only those have been chosen from my notes which were\r\nunder my own observation for a considerable time, and many of these have\r\nbeen brought up to date since my return to England. I have, as a rule,\r\navoided the inclusion of cases seen cursorily, and few simple ones have\r\nbeen quoted since their character is sufficiently indicated in the text.\r\nThese remarks seem necessary since the mode of selection has resulted in\r\nthe inclusion of a number of cases of exceptional severity, and any\r\nattempt to draw statistical conclusions from them would be most\r\nmisleading.\r\n\r\nThe first two chapters have been added with a view to affording some\r\ninformation, first, as to the conditions under which a great part of the\r\nsurgical work was done, and, secondly, as to the mechanism and causation\r\nof the injuries, which would not readily be at hand in the case of the\r\ngeneral surgical reader. For much of the information contained in\r\nChapter II. I must express my indebtedness to the work of MM. Nimier and\r\nLaval, so frequently quoted.\r\n\r\nThe only other object of this Preface is to express my thanks to the\r\nmany who have aided me in the task of amplifying the observations on\r\nwhich the articles are founded, and I think no writer ever received more\r\nsympathetic and kindly help in such particulars than the author.\r\n\r\nMy first thanks, those due to the Members of the Royal Army Medical\r\nCorps, I endeavour to express by the dedication of this volume. Any\r\nattempt to make individual acknowledgment to either the Members of the\r\nService, or to the Civil Surgeons temporarily attached, would be\r\nimpossible. I have, however, tried to associate the names of many of\r\nthose in charge of cases in the recital of histories and treatment\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are not less due to the Military Heads of Departments at the\r\nWar Office, who have helped me in the collection of details as to the\r\nsubsequent course of many of the cases described, and in the acquisition\r\nof information regarding the weapons and ammunition treated of. I should\r\nparticularly express my gratitude to Colonel Robb, of the\r\nAdjutant-General's Department, and Colonel Montgomery, of the Ordnance\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nI am greatly indebted to my former colleague Mr. Cheatle for two of the\r\nillustrations of wounds, and for permission to quote some of his other\r\nexperience, and to Mr. Henry Catling, to whose skill I owe the majority\r\nof the skiagrams of the fractures under my observation at Wynberg and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nI must also express my thanks to Mr. Danielsson and his artist, Mr.\r\nFord, for the trouble they have taken in converting my rough sketches\r\ninto the illustrations contained in the volume.\r\n\r\nLastly, my warmest gratitude is due to my friends, Mr. Cuthbert Wallace,\r\nwho has read some of my chapters, and to Mr. F. C. Abbott, who has read\r\nthe whole book for the press and suggested many improvements and\r\nmodifications.\r\n\r\n47 CHARLES STREET, BERKELEY SQUARE, W.\r\n\r\n_February_

For this reason few cases are quoted beyond\r\nthose coming under my own immediate observation, and in the few\r\ninstances where others are made use of the source of quotation is\r\nindicated. It will be noted that my experience was almost entirely\r\nconfined to bullet wounds, and in this respect it no doubt differs from\r\nthat of surgeons employed in Natal, where shell injuries were more\r\nnumerous. This is, however, of the less moment for my purpose as there\r\nis probably little to add regarding shell injuries to what is already\r\nknown, while, on the other hand, the opportunity of observing large\r\nnumbers of injuries from rifle bullets of small calibre has not\r\npreviously been afforded to British surgeons.\r\n\r\nI think the general trend of the observations goes to show that the\r\nemployment of bullets of small calibre is all to the advantage of the\r\nmen wounded, except in so far as the increased possibilities of the\r\nrange of fire may augment the number of individuals hit; also that such\r\nvariations as exist between wounds inflicted by bullets of the\r\nMartini-Henry and Mauser types respectively, depend rather on the form\r\nand bulk of the projectile than on any inherent difference in the nature\r\nof the injuries. Thus in the chapter devoted to the general characters\r\nof the wounds, it will be seen that most of the older types of entry\r\nand exit aperture are produced in miniature by the small modern bullet,\r\nand that the main peculiarity of the deeper injuries is the frequent\r\nstrict localisation of the direct damage to an area of no greater width\r\nthan that crossed by narrow structures of importance such as arteries or\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that I am unable to furnish any important\r\nstatistical details, but incomplete numbers, such as are at my disposal,\r\nwould be of little value. In view, however, of the considerable interval\r\nwhich must elapse before the Royal Army Medical Corps is able to arrange\r\nand publish the large material which will have accumulated, it has\r\nseemed unwise to defer publication until the completion of a report\r\nwhich will deal with such matters thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to premise the opportunities which I enjoyed of\r\ngaining experience during the campaign. I arrived in South Africa on\r\nNovember 19, 1899; two days later I proceeded to Orange River with\r\nSurgeon-General Wilson, and on the day three weeks after leaving home\r\nperformed some operations in the field hospitals on patients from the\r\nbattle of Belmont. I remained at Orange River during the three next\r\nengagements, Graspan, Enslin, and Modder River, and on the day of\r\nMagersfontein I went forward to the Field hospitals at Modder River,\r\narriving during the bringing in of the patients from the field of\r\nbattle. I returned to Orange River with the patients and remained there\r\na further period of three weeks, during which time the patients were\r\ngradually transferred to the Base hospitals at Wynberg. At Christmas I\r\nfollowed the patients down to the base, and thus was able to observe the\r\ncourse of the cases from their commencement to convalescence. I remained\r\nat Wynberg six weeks, during which time a number of cases from the\r\nneighbourhood of Rensburg and some from Natal were received. On February\r\n7, I left Wynberg, following Lord Roberts up to my old quarters at\r\nModder River, where I saw a few wounded men brought in from the\r\nengagements at Koodoosberg Drift. On Lord Roberts's departure for\r\nBloemfontein he requested me to return to Wynberg to await the wounded\r\nwho might be sent down from the fighting which might occur during his\r\nadvance. I therefore had the disappointment of seeing the start of the\r\narmy, and then returning to Wynberg, where I remained for another six\r\nweeks in attendance at Nos. 1 and 2 General Hospitals.\r\n\r\nDuring this period a very large number of the wounded from Paardeberg\r\nDrift and other battles were sent down and treated, after which surgical\r\nwork began to flag.\r\n\r\nOn April 14, I was recalled to the front and journeyed to Bloemfontein,\r\nwhere I stayed three weeks, making one journey out to the Bearer Company\r\nof the IX. Division at the Waterworks.\r\n\r\nOn May 4, I left Bloemfontein with Lord Roberts's army, and shortly\r\nafter joined the IX. Division, with which I journeyed until the\r\ncommencement of June, seeing a good deal of scattered work in the field\r\nand Field hospitals, and in the small temporary improvised hospitals in\r\nthe towns of Winberg, Lindley, and Heilbron. Early in June I left\r\nHeilbron with Lord Methuen's division, and spent the next four weeks\r\nwith this division in the field. Thence I journeyed to Pretoria and\r\nJohannesburg, seeing a small number of wounded in each town, and on July\r\n10, with Lord Roberts's consent, I started for home, visiting a number\r\nof the hospitals in the Orange River Colony and Natal on my way down to\r\nCape Town. During the movements briefly recorded above, which absorbed a\r\nperiod of nine months, my time was fairly evenly divided between Field,\r\nStationary, and Base hospitals; hence I had opportunities of observing\r\nthe patients in every stage of their illnesses, and in all some\r\nthousands of men came under my notice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Linen Holdall with surgical instruments]\r\n\r\nMy departure for the seat of war was rather hurried, hence my surgical\r\nequipment was not of an extensive nature. It may be of interest,\r\nhowever, to shortly recount what it consisted in, since it proved an\r\nample one, and yet was carried in a small satchel. The plan of selection\r\nadopted consisted in carefully going through the equipment of the\r\nBritish Field Hospital, and then adding such other instruments as seemed\r\nto me likely to be useful. With few exceptions, therefore, designed to\r\nmeet emergencies, my set of instruments formed a supplement to the\r\nactual necessities carried by the Service hospitals, and was as\r\nfollows:--4 trephines, Horsley's elevator, brain knife and seeker. 2\r\npairs of Hoffman's and 1 pair of Lane's fulcrum gouge forceps, 3 bone\r\ngouges, 1 pair straight 1 curved necrosis forceps, 1 pair bone forceps.\r\n1 Wood's 1 Horsley's skull saws, 18 Gigli's saws with an extra handle,\r\nand two Podrez' directors for the same. 1 set Lane's bone drills,\r\nbroaches, screw-drivers, and counter-sink with eight ounces of screws:\r\nsilver patella wire, and 1 pair Peter's bone forceps. 2 aneurism\r\nneedles, 1 bullet probe, 1 pair Egyptian Army pattern bullet forceps. 4\r\nLane's and 3 pairs Makins's bowel clamps, Nos. 3 4 and 5 Laplace's\r\nbowel forceps, 6 Murphy's buttons, 1 pair Morris's retractors, 6 dozen\r\nintestine needles, 2 Macphail's needle-holders, Nos. 4 5 6 Thomas's\r\nslot-eyed needles, 1 mouth gag, 1 Durham's double raspatory, 3 strong\r\nplated raspatories, 1 pair tongue forceps, 1 tracheal dilator, 1 pair\r\nhernia needles, 1 hernia and 1 ordinary steel director, 1 transfusion\r\nset with metal funnel, and a stock of Messrs. Burroughes and Wellcome's\r\ncompound saline infusion soloids. 1 antitoxin syringe. 6 scalpels, 2\r\nblunt-pointed curved bistouries, 6 forcipressure forceps, 1 pair Jordan\r\nLloyd's retractors, 1 pair ordinary retractors, 2 pairs of forceps, 3\r\npairs of Scissors, 1 skin-grafting razor and roll of perforated tin\r\nfoil, 1 metal pocket case, and 1 hypodermic syringe with tabloids. A\r\nstock of silkworm gut, horsehair and silk ligatures, the latter prepared\r\nand sterilised for me by Miss Taylor, the Theatre Sister at St. Thomas's\r\nHospital. Some pairs of McBurney's india-rubber, and cotton-thread\r\noperating gloves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Instrument Holdall rolled]\r\n\r\nThe instruments were packed in sets in small linen holdalls suggested\r\nand made by Messrs. Down Bros., who also devised my satchel. In the\r\nlight of the experience gained I should have preferred a tin case to the\r\nsatchel, as it never needed to be carried on horseback.\r\n\r\nFor dressings I trusted entirely to the Royal Army Medical Corps, and at\r\nmy request Colonel Gubbins, R.A.M.C., sent out to the Cape a quantity\r\nof sterilised sponges and pads made by Messrs. Robinson & Co. Ltd. of\r\nChesterfield, which fully met all requirements in this direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Tin Water-bottle for the march (Military\r\nEquipment Company)]\r\n\r\nThis equipment was superfluous at the Base hospitals, but when in the\r\nfield with the troops proved very useful. In the early part of the\r\ncampaign I was able to do all my travelling by train, but later I\r\ntravelled by road only. I received the greatest kindness and help in\r\nthis particular. General Sir William Nicholson, Chief Director of\r\nTransport, provided me with a buggy, a pair of horses, and a driver, and\r\nPrince Francis of Teck, the Chief Remount Officer, selected a pony\r\nsuitable to my equestrian powers. The buggy proved a very great success;\r\nthe box seat carried my instruments and dressings, the front a 4-gallon\r\ntin water-bottle for emergency operations, and the rear shelf my\r\npersonal belongings. The water-bottle was lent to me by the Portland\r\nHospital. (Fig. 3.)\r\n\r\nThe cart was able to cross any drifts or dongas, and when an engagement\r\nwas in progress was able to accompany the Ambulance wagons, so that I\r\nhad all my necessaries on the spot, even at the first dressing station.\r\nIn point of fact when with the Highland Brigade, on some occasions, we\r\ndid all necessary operations on the spot during the progress of\r\nfighting; a most useful performance, since fighting on several days did\r\nnot cease till dark, and the evenings were much too cold to allow of\r\noperations being done with safety to the patients. The great advantage\r\nof the buggy was its lightness and smallness. On one occasion it\r\naccompanied me between 500 and 600 miles without a single accident,\r\nbeyond the fact that one night I was relieved of both my horses by some\r\ntroopers whose own were worn out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--My Buggy on the veldt at Bloemfontein. (Photo by\r\nMr. Bowlby)]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the general health of the troops as subjects of surgical\r\nwounds, I suppose a better class of patient could scarcely be found. The\r\nmen were young, sound, well set and nourished, and hard and fit from\r\nexercise in the open air. Beyond this, in spite of the scarcity of\r\nvegetables, a certain amount of fruit, rations of jam, and lime juice\r\nmade any sign of scurvy a rare occurrence--I never saw a case during the\r\nwhole of my wanderings. The meat was good, especially in the early part\r\nof the campaign, when it was for the most part brought from Australia\r\nand New Zealand, and we enjoyed the two collateral advantages of getting\r\nplenty of the ice which had been used for the preservation of the meat,\r\nin the camps, and the still greater one of having no butchers' offal to\r\nneed destruction or prove a source of danger. When bread was to be got\r\nit was fairly good, and the biscuit was at all times excellent. Except\r\non the advance from Modder River to Bloemfontein, as far as I could\r\njudge, no large bodies of the men ever really suffered from shortness of\r\nfood, and then only for a few days. Drink was a more serious problem: in\r\nthe early days beer was to be got at the canteens, but with the increase\r\nof numbers and difficulties of transport this ceased to be the case, and\r\nwater was the sole fluid available. This was often muddy, and the\r\nsoldiers would take very little care what they drank unless under\r\nconstant supervision; hence a great quantity of very undesirable water\r\nwas drunk. None the less I think the water was more often the cause of\r\nsand diarrhoea than of enteric fever. A large quantity of fluid was by\r\nno means a necessity if the men would only have exercised some\r\nself-control. During the first week I spent at Orange River, I drank\r\nlime juice and water all day, but after that time, by a very slight\r\namount of determination, I thoroughly broke myself of the habit, and\r\ndrank at meal-times only. Most of the men however emptied their\r\nwater-bottles during the first hour of the march, and the rest of the\r\nday endured agony, seizing the first opportunity of drinking any filthy\r\nwater they met with. When, for instance, we camped near a vlei, and the\r\nGeneral took the greatest care that the mules and horses should be\r\nwatered at one spot only, in order to preserve the cleanliness of the\r\nrest of the pool, the men would often go and fill their water-bottles\r\namongst the animals' feet rather than take the trouble to walk the few\r\nnecessary yards round. In such particulars they needed constant\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nThe climate on the western side was a great element no doubt both in the\r\ngeneral healthiness of the men and in the general good results seen in\r\nthe healing of wounds. The days were often hot; thus even in November at\r\nOrange River the thermometer registered 115 deg.F. in the single bell tents,\r\nbut on the other hand the nights were cool and refreshing. The air was\r\nvery pure and exceedingly dry, while the constant sunshine not only kept\r\nup the spirits, but also proved the most efficient disinfector of any\r\nground fouled to less than a serious extent. Dust was our principal\r\nbugbear; and when a camp had been settled for a few days, flies; both of\r\nthese evils increasing rapidly as the stay on any one spot was\r\nprolonged. My personal experience of rain was small, but I was twice in\r\ncamp, once at Orange River and once at Bloemfontein, when very heavy\r\nrain fell, and this was sufficient to make the camps terribly\r\nuncomfortable for a few days.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, as might be expected, until the outbreak of\r\nenteric fever the health of the men was remarkably good, minor ailments\r\nalone prevailing. One of the most troublesome of these was diarrhoea,\r\nwhich gained the appellation of 'the Modders,' already a classical name\r\nas far as South Africa is concerned. This most frequently, I think,\r\ndepended on errors of diet, combined with the swallowing of a large\r\namount of sand with the food as dust, and in the water drunk. Cases of\r\nsevere dysentery, however, were also not very uncommon. Rheumatic pains\r\nwere a common ailment, which, considering the dryness of the atmosphere,\r\nwould hardly have been expected. Continued fever of a somewhat special\r\ntype was not uncommon, and was sometimes spoken of under the name of the\r\ndistrict, sometimes as veldt fever--of this I will say nothing, as\r\nothers better fitted to point out its peculiarities will no doubt deal\r\nwith it. Enteric fever, our chief scourge, I will pass over for the same\r\nreason. I might, however, remark from the point of view of one not very\r\nexperienced in this disease, that in a large number of the fatal cases I\r\nhappened to see, the actual cause of death seemed to me to be septicaemia\r\nfrom absorption from the mouth. The mouths were unusually bad, even\r\nallowing for the often insufficient cleansing that was able to be\r\ncarried out, and I was inclined to attribute these in some degree to the\r\ndryness of the atmosphere, which very quickly and effectively dried up\r\nthe mucous membrane of the mouth in patients not breathing through the\r\nnose, and encouraged the formation of large cracks. Pneumonia was rare,\r\nand this was rendered the more striking from the comparatively large\r\nnumber of men who contracted the disease on board ship on the voyage out\r\nfrom England.\r\n\r\nAs will be gathered from the above, medical disease seldom called for\r\nthe aid of the surgeon. Abdominal section was occasionally considered in\r\ncases of perforation in enteric fever, and was, I believe, a few times\r\nperformed, but as far as I know without success. It was also proposed to\r\ntreat some of the severe dysentery cases by colotomy, but I never saw\r\nthe method tried. As far as I was concerned I never met with a case of\r\neither disease I thought suitable for the treatment. I saw one case in\r\nwhich an abscess of the liver had followed an attack of enteric, which\r\nhad been successfully treated by incision, and a few cases of tropical\r\nabscess which probably came into the country were also subjected to\r\noperation. Some cases of appendicitis, as would be expected, also needed\r\nsurgical treatment. In a few instances empyema followed influenza, and a\r\nfew cases of mastoid suppuration had to be dealt with.\r\n\r\nOf surgical diseases the one most special to the campaign, although not\r\nof great importance, was the veldt sore. This was a small localised\r\nsuppuration most common on the hands and neck, but sometimes invading\r\nthe whole trunk, more particularly the lower extremities however, when\r\nthe covered parts of the body were attacked. The sores were no doubt the\r\nresult of local infections; they reminded me most of the sores seen on\r\nthe hands of plasterers, and I think there is no doubt the dust was\r\nresponsible for them. I think piles were somewhat more prevalent than\r\nthey should have been among the men, but this was probably dependent on\r\nthe strain involved in defaecation in the squatting position, since the\r\nsoldiers were for the most part regularly attentive to the calls of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI saw a good many cases of lightning stroke, and some were fatal.\r\nSunstroke was not common, and, considering the heat, it was very\r\nremarkable how little the men suffered from this condition. This was no\r\ndoubt in part attributable to the absence of the possibility of getting\r\nalcoholic drinks, but it is not common for any one in South Africa to\r\nsuffer in this way, probably as a result of the continuous nature of the\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the labours of hospital surgeons at home, it was rather\r\ninstructive to see the number of men who suffered with hernia,\r\nvaricocele, and varicose veins to a sufficient degree to necessitate\r\ngoing to the base. The experience quite sufficed to explain the trouble\r\nwhich is taken to prevent men with these complaints entering the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATION OF THE NUMBER OF MEN KILLED AND WOUNDED\r\n\r\nI will now pass to the question of the proportionate frequency with\r\nwhich the men were killed or wounded during the present campaign. I\r\npropose to take only one series of battles, with which I was personally\r\nacquainted throughout, to illustrate this point. This seems the more\r\nsatisfactory course to follow, since the number of casualties is still\r\nundergoing continuous gradual increase, and besides this the warfare has\r\nassumed a peculiar and irregular form, statistics from which scarcely\r\npossess general application.\r\n\r\nThe battles included, those of the first Kimberley Relief Force, were\r\nfought under fair average conditions as to the nature of the ground. In\r\nthe first two the defending enemy occupied heights, in the two following\r\nthe ground advanced over by our men was comparatively even; thus at\r\nModder River there was only a gradual slope upwards, and at\r\nMagersfontein the advanced trenches of the Boers were only slightly\r\nabove the level of the ground over which the advance was made. At the\r\nsame time, at the latter battle a great number of the Boers engaged were\r\non the sides of the hill well above the advanced trenches. In no case\r\nwere the Boers in such a position as to have to fire upwards, to them a\r\nconsiderable advantage. It must also be noted that throughout the Boers\r\nwere able to rest their rifles; hence the fire should have been at any\r\nrate of an average degree of accuracy. In the advances of our own men,\r\nanthills and stones were practically the only cover to be obtained, and\r\nlittle or no help was given by variations in the general surface. All\r\nthese points seem to favour a large proportional number of hits on the\r\npart of the riflemen. I very much regret that I am unable to say what\r\nwas the proportional number of shell wounds among the men hit, but I can\r\nsay with some confidence that among the wounded it was not as great as\r\nten per cent. I should be inclined to place it as low as five per cent.\r\nAgain, I cannot fix the proportionate occurrence of wounds from bullets\r\nof large calibre such as the Martini-Henry, but this was certainly not\r\nlarge. I think if ten per cent. is deducted to represent the number of\r\nhits from either of these forms of projectile, that we may fairly assume\r\nthe remaining 90 per cent. of the wounds to have been produced by\r\nbullets of small calibre. The numbers of the opposing forces were\r\nprobably fairly even.\r\n\r\nTaking all these circumstances together, and bearing in mind that our\r\narmy was always in the position of having to make frontal attacks on men\r\nwell protected in strong positions, I think it must be allowed that a\r\nfair idea should be possible of the effectiveness of the modern weapons.\r\nOnly one circumstance, one inseparable from any fighting with the Boers,\r\nseems to affect the numbers in an important manner. This consists in the\r\nfact that the Boer rarely fights to the bitter end, hence the greater\r\nproportion of his hits are obtained at long distances.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\n+---------------------+--------+------+-------+-------+-----+-------------+\r\n|                     | Number |      |       |       |     |Percentage of|\r\n|                     |   of   |      |       |       |     | killed and  |\r\n|                     | troops |Killed|Wounded|Missing|Total| wounded to  |\r\n|                     | engaged|      |       |       |     |number of men|\r\n|                     |        |      |       |       |     |   engaged   |\r\n+---------------------+--------+------+-------+-------+-----+-------------+\r\n|_Belmont:_           |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|  Officers           |    297 |    3 |    23 |     0 |  26 |        8.75 |\r\n|  Non.-com. officers |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|   and men           |  8,396 |   55 |   206 |     4 | 265 |        3.15 |\r\n|                     +--------+------+-------+-------+-----+-------------+\r\n|      Total          |  8,693 |   58 |   229 |     4 | 291 |        3.34 |\r\n|                     |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|_Graspan:_           |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|  Officers           |    326 |    3 |     7 |     0 |  10 |        3.06 |\r\n|  Non.-com. officers |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|    and men          |  8,213 |   18 |   163 |     7 | 188 |        2.29 |\r\n|                     +--------+------+-------+-------+-----+-------------+\r\n|      Total          |  8,539 |   21 |   170 |     7 | 198 |        2.31 |\r\n|                     |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|_Modder River:_      |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|  Officers           |    335 |    3 |    19 |     0 |  22 |        6.56 |\r\n|  Non.-com. officers |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|    and men          |  9,856 |   67 |   377 |    18 | 462 |        4.68 |\r\n|                     +--------+------+-------+-------+-----+-------------+\r\n|      Total          | 10,191 |   70 |   396 |    18 | 484 |        4.74 |\r\n|                     |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|_Magersfontein:_     |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|  Officers           |    379 |   18 |    48 |     2 |  68 |       17.94 |\r\n|  Non.-com. officers |        |      |       |       |     |             |\r\n|    and men          | 11,068 |  148 |   669 |   101 | 918 |        8.29 |\r\n|                     +--------+------+-------+-------+-----+-------------+\r\n|      Total[1]       | 11,447 |  166 |   717 |   103 | 986 |        8.43 |\r\n+---------------------+--------+------+-------+-------+-----+-------------+\r\n\r\nTable I. gives the number of men engaged, and also that of the killed\r\nand wounded at each of four battles.

It is mainly attributable to the circumstance that\r\nthe officers, as leading, are always in the front and most exposed\r\nposition. I much doubt whether at the end of the campaign the entire\r\nabandonment of distinctive badges will be found to have had any very\r\nimportant result in decreasing the relative number of casualties as\r\nbetween officers and men. At close quarters distinctive uniform is no\r\ndoubt a danger, but at the common ranges of 1,000 yards and upwards the\r\nenemy's fire is rather directed to cover a zone than to pick out\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nThe especially high mortality among the officers at the battle of\r\nGraspan was attributable to the casualties among the naval officers, and\r\nthe men of the brigade suffered most severely also.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the most expensive battles were those of Belmont\r\nand Magersfontein.\r\n\r\nIf the numbers of the men actually taking part in the fighting in these\r\nbattles as given in Table I. are massed, we get an approximate total of\r\n12,420.[3]\r\n\r\nOf this number, 1,959 or 15.06 per cent. were reported as killed,\r\nwounded, or missing. Thus: killed, 315 or 2.53 per cent.; wounded, 1,512\r\nor 12.17 per cent.; missing, 132 or 1.06 per cent. Reference to Table\r\nIII. shows that these percentages almost exactly correspond with those\r\nobtaining in the entire Crimean campaign, and are greater than those\r\nobserved in the German army during the entire Franco-German campaign.\r\n\r\nThe mortality statistics given in Table II. are of great interest,\r\nsince to those dying on the field are added all men dying within the\r\nfirst 48 hours in the Field hospitals. From the surgical point of view\r\nthese men all received mortal injury, and are therefore properly\r\nincluded among the fatalities. Their inclusion, moreover, makes an\r\nappreciable difference in the percentage proportion of mortal injuries\r\nto wounds. Thus, if the numbers are massed (omitting the 'missing'), we\r\nfind that in the four battles 1,827 men were hit, of whom 315, or 17.24\r\nper cent., were killed. Among the wounded carried off the field,\r\nhowever, 49 received mortal injuries, and if these are added to the 315,\r\nwe find that the proportion of mortal injuries reaches 19.92 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III[4]\r\n\r\n+-----------------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+----------+\r\n|                       |         |         |  1871. |   1877. |    1899. |\r\n|                       |   1815. |   1854. | Franco-| Russo-  | Kimberley|\r\n|                       | Waterloo| Crimean | German | Turkish | Relief   |\r\n|                       | (English|    War  |    War |    War  | Force    |\r\n|                       | troops) | (English| (German| (Russian| (English |\r\n|                       |         | troops) | troops)| troops) | troops)  |\r\n+-----------------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+----------+\r\n| Number of troops      |         |         |        |         |          |\r\n|  engaged              |  36,240 |  97,864 | 887,876| 300,000 |   15,748 |\r\n|                       |         |         |        |         |          |\r\n| Number of killed      |   1,759 |   2,775 |  17,570|  32,780 |      315 |\r\n| Percentage            |    4.85 |    2.81 |    1.97|   10.92 |        2 |\r\n|                       |         |         |        |         |          |\r\n| Number of wounded     |   5,892 |  12,094 |  96,189|  71,268 |    1,512 |\r\n| Percentage            |   16.25 |   12.35 |   10.83|   23.75 |     9.60 |\r\n|                       |         |         |        |         |          |\r\n| Number of missing     |     807 |    --   |   4,009|    --   |      132 |\r\n| Percentage            |    2.19 |    --   |    0.45|    --   |      .83 |\r\n+-----------------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+----------+\r\n| Total killed,         |         |         |        |         |          |\r\n|  wounded, and missing |   8,458 |  14,849 | 117,768| 104,050 |    1,959 |\r\n| Percentage            |   23.31 |   15.17 |   13.26|   34.68 |    12.43 |\r\n+-----------------------+---------+---------+--------+---------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe proportion of men killed to those wounded was as follows: killed\r\n315, wounded 1,512, or 1 to 4.8. If we add to the men killed on the\r\nfield of battle the 49 dying in the next 48 hours, the proportion of\r\nfatalities is increased to 1 to 4.15. The higher of these proportions is\r\ncertainly the surgically correct one.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the general accuracy of the numbers given above, a\r\ncomparison of those published for the campaign up to September 15, 1900,\r\nis of value, as the two series substantially tally. Thus, up to that\r\ndate, 17,072 men were hit, and of these 2,998 were killed. The\r\nproportion killed to wounded was therefore 1 to 4.69.\r\n\r\nIf it be borne in mind that of the wounded men included in Table I., 1.5\r\nper cent. died later in the Base hospitals, the percentages are almost\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nTable III. is inserted with a view to instituting a comparison between\r\nthe number of casualties in the present and earlier campaigns.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this table it is necessary to take the approximate\r\nnumber of men at Lord Methuen's disposal, irrespective of their active\r\nparticipation in the fighting.\r\n\r\nThe result of this addition to the total is to show that the percentage\r\nof men killed and wounded was slightly lower than in the Crimean war,\r\nand nearly corresponded with that observed in the Franco-German\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nAs it has been shown that our numbers correspond in general with those\r\nof the whole war up to September 15, 1900, there can be little doubt\r\nthat the same ratios will be maintained to the close of the campaign.\r\n\r\nOn the face of the numbers, therefore, there is little ground for\r\nassuming that the change in the nature of the weapons has materially\r\ninfluenced the deadliness of warfare at all. This is capable of\r\nexplanation on the ground that in the Crimea the battles were fought at\r\nmuch closer quarters, and hence the weapons of the time were as\r\neffective, or more so, than the present ones. That this increased\r\ndistance between the combatants will always counterbalance the increased\r\ndeadliness of the weapons in the future is more than probable, since the\r\nrange of effectiveness has been increased both in rifle and in artillery\r\nfire. In the present campaign the effect of the latter was very\r\nnoticeable, since the Boers were, as a rule, quickly displaced by shell\r\nfire, unless they were in especially favourable positions, and this\r\nalthough no great number of men was hit by the projectiles. Under these\r\ncircumstances, except on some occasions, neither side derived all the\r\nadvantage from the increased shooting powers of their rifles which might\r\nhave been expected. To a lesser degree this will probably always be the\r\ncase in the future.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these remarks, however, I would point to column 4 of\r\nTable III., as showing how difficult it is to draw definite deductions\r\nfrom any particular set of numbers alone. This column shows that in the\r\nRusso-Turkish War of 1877 all the percentages were practically doubled\r\nor more, and in the case of the number of men killed on the field of\r\nbattle, the number was nearly five times as great as either in the\r\nCrimea or the present campaign. The explanation here depends on the race\r\nof men and their tenacity in resistance alone. In the case of either\r\nnation death in battle is little feared, and slight inclination to avoid\r\nit exists. When the theory of war held by the Boer--_i.e._ going out to\r\nshoot an enemy without incurring risk of being yourself shot--is borne\r\nin mind, the special circumstances attending the present campaign are\r\nsufficiently obvious to need little further remark. A future campaign in\r\nwhich the combatants are as equally well armed, but each side stands to\r\nthe last, will probably give very different results.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that no details can be given as to the influence of\r\nrange in altering the relative numbers of killed to wounded. It may be\r\nstated, however, that in no instance did the percentage of killed to\r\nwounded reach 25 per cent. At the battle of Magersfontein it amounted to\r\n19.26 per cent., at Colenso to 17.97 per cent., and at both these\r\nengagements there is little doubt that a considerable number of the men\r\nwere hit within a distance of 1,000 yards. When the distances were very\r\nshort the injuries were frequently multiple; and this character was a\r\nmore common source of danger than increase of severity in the individual\r\nwounds received at a short range.\r\n\r\nA short consideration of the circumstances especially influencing the\r\nultimate mortality amongst the wounded subsequent to the reception of\r\nthe injury is here necessary, although I shall be obliged to make my\r\nremarks as short as possible. The subject is best treated of under the\r\ntwo headings of Transport and Hospital Accommodation.\r\n\r\n_Transport._--The importance of transport is felt from the moment of the\r\ninjury till the time of arrival of the patient in the mother country. To\r\nthe surgeon it is of the same vital importance as the carrying of food\r\nfor the troops is to the combatant general.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Removal of the wounded from the field of battle. My experience was\r\nopposed to hurried action in this matter, although it is necessary to\r\ngather up the wounded before nightfall if possible. As a rule wounded\r\nmen should not be removed from the field of battle under fire, at any\r\nrate when the troops are in open order at a range of 1,000 yards or\r\nmore. I saw several instances in which mortal wounds were incurred by\r\npreviously wounded men or their bearers during the process of removal,\r\nwhile it was astonishing how many scattered wounded men could lie out\r\nunder a heavy fire and escape by the doctrine of chances. The erect\r\nposition and small group necessary to bear off a wounded man at once\r\ndraws a concentrated fire, if fighting is still proceeding.\r\n\r\nAs to the best and quickest method of removing the patients to the first\r\ndressing station, there were few occasions when this was not more\r\nsatisfactorily done by bearers with stretchers than by wagons. The\r\nmovement was more easy to the wounded men, and, as a rule, time was\r\nsaved. Over rough ground the wagons travel slowly, and patients with\r\nonly provisional splints were shaken undesirably. A stretcher party in\r\nmy experience easily outstripped the wagon unless a road or very smooth\r\nveldt existed. A larger number of men is of course required, but I take\r\nit that on the occasion of a great war men are both more easily obtained\r\nand fed than are transport animals. From what I have been able to learn,\r\nboth the Indian dhoolie-bearers and the hastily recruited Colonial\r\nbearer companies were most successful in the removal of the large number\r\nof wounded men from the field of Colenso. I had several opportunities of\r\ncomparing the two methods on a smaller scale during the fighting in\r\nOrange River Colony, and felt very strongly in favour of the stretcher\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nFor removal of patients from one part of a hospital to another, or\r\nsometimes in loading trains, &c., great economy of men, and increased\r\ncomfort to the patients, may be attained by the use of some form of\r\nambulance trolly.\r\n\r\nI append an illustration of what seemed to me the simplest and best I\r\ncame across among several in use in South Africa. The description\r\nbeneath is by Major McCormack, R.A.M.C., its inventor (fig. 5).\r\n\r\nWhen wagons were necessary or preferable, the Indian Tongas (fig. 6),\r\npresented by Mr. Dhanjibhoy, were most useful; they carried two men\r\nlying down, the same number as the big service wagon, and were drawn by\r\ntwo ponies only. Although somewhat highly springed, the vehicle is so\r\nwell arranged and padded, that the occupants are seldom hurt by striking\r\nagainst the sides with rough jolting, unless quite helpless. I\r\noccasionally made long journeys in this vehicle with much comfort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--The McCormack-Brook Wheeled Stretcher Carriage.\r\nIt consists of an under-carriage built up of two light wheels with steel\r\nspokes and rims with rubber tyres and ball bearings; on the axle are two\r\nlight elliptic springs, to which is attached a transverse seat for the\r\nstretcher-carrier proper. This is securely bolted on to the seat, and\r\nconsists of two pieces of hard wood, suitably worked, and forming an\r\nangle frame. On the bottom side the stretcher poles rest, and the sides\r\nof the L formed by the carrier proper prevent most effectually any\r\njerking or turning of the stretcher when once it has been laid in the\r\ncarrier. The carrier is about thirty inches long, but can be increased\r\nto any length desired. It has been found that this length is admirably\r\nsuited for all purposes. To prevent the stretcher from any lateral or\r\nupward movement, two buttons with tightening screws are attached to the\r\ntop of the carrier on each side. When the stretcher is laid on the\r\ncarrier the screws are tightened and the stretcher is held rigid.\r\n\r\nTwo iron supports are provided, one at each end and on opposite sides of\r\nthe carrier. These are lowered when it is desired either to place the\r\nstretcher on the carriage or remove it therefrom, which can be effected\r\nin a second. The carriage meanwhile remains perfectly still. When the\r\ncarriage is in motion the iron supports are turned up, and lie along the\r\nrespective sides of the carrier, where each rests in a small clip. The\r\ngreat object of this stretcher carriage has been to obtain mobility,\r\nstrength, and lightness combined with efficiency and a ready and easy\r\nmeans of transport for sick and wounded, no matter where a patient has\r\nto be transported from. The loaded stretcher and wheeled carriage can be\r\nreadily handled by one man on good roads, and by two men in rough\r\ncountry. The springs prevent any jar being felt by the patient on the\r\nstretcher.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) For the longer journeys to the Field or Stationary hospitals, the\r\nservice wagon and other transport vehicles came into use, particularly\r\nthe South African ox-wagon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6--Indian Tonga on the march. (Photo by Mr. Bowlby)]\r\n\r\nThe service wagon (fig. 7) is a heavy four-wheeled vehicle, drawn by ten\r\nmules. The good construction of the wagon was amply proved by the manner\r\nin which it stood the hard wear and tear of the present campaign. It is,\r\nhowever, very heavy, and in comparison with its size affords very small\r\naccommodation. Two lying-down patients and six sitting is its entire\r\ncapacity. Some modified patterns were in use, notably those with the\r\nIrish and Imperial Yeomanry Field Hospitals, capable of carrying four\r\nlying-down cases, the men being arranged in two tiers. Major Hale,\r\nR.A.M.C., made a very successful trek from Rhenoster to Kroonstadt with\r\nsome of these, carrying twice the regulation number of lying-down cases\r\nin his wagons. Some modification in the mode of fixation is, however,\r\nnecessary to increase the security of the stretchers of the upper\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nA really satisfactory wagon, combining both strength and comfort, still\r\nremains to be devised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Service Ambulance Wagon, the six front mules\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n(Photo by Mr. C. S. Wallace)]\r\n\r\nDuring the later stages of the campaign, a very large number of patients\r\nwere transported by the South African ox- or mule- (buck) wagons.\r\nAlthough not of prepossessing appearance, and unprovided with any sort\r\nof springs, these vehicles were far from unsatisfactory. The ox-wagon\r\nconsists of a long simple platform, 19 ft. 2 in. in length, 4 ft. 6 in.\r\nin width, from the sides of which a slanting board rises over the wheels\r\nfor the posterior two-thirds. These bulwarks increase the actual width\r\nto 6 ft. 6 in., which corresponds with the gross width occupied by the\r\nwheels. One third is covered by a small hood 5 ft. 6 in. in height\r\nerected on wooden stave hoops. The latter was often absent in transport\r\nwagons. The two hind wheels are large, the fore somewhat smaller. They\r\nare attached to very heavy wooden cross-beams bearing the axles, and the\r\ntwo beams are connected by a longitudinal bar, continuous with the\r\nduessel boom or pole. This latter bar is in two sections, the connection\r\nof which allows considerable play in the long axis and serves to break\r\nthe jolts occurring when either pair of wheels passes over uneven spots\r\non the ground. When some sacks of oats or hay were spread over the\r\nfloor the wounded men travelled comparatively comfortably in these\r\nwagons, the great distance between the fore and hind wheels tending to\r\nminimise the jolting. The principal objection to them was the slow pace\r\nof the oxen, and the fact that to obtain the greatest amount of work\r\nfrom these animals a major part of the journey must be performed during\r\nthe night. The ox-wagon carries, with comfort, four lying-down cases on\r\nstretchers, or six without stretchers; or twenty sitting-up cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--South African Wagon, loaded with patients, and\r\nmule transport. (Photo by Mr. C. S. Wallace)]\r\n\r\nThe mule- or buck-wagon, which is of the same class but smaller, can\r\nonly accommodate two stretchers, four lying-down men without stretchers,\r\nor 12-14 sitting-up cases. As a rule, the wagons were loaded with\r\nrecumbent cases in the centre, while more slightly wounded men sat\r\naround, and were able to give help to those lying down when needed. The\r\nwagons can be covered with canvas throughout.\r\n\r\nThe steady even pace of the oxen is a great advantage, and I was often\r\nsurprised to see how well men bore transport in these wagons, who seemed\r\nutterly unfit to be moved had it not been an absolute necessity. A very\r\nlarge number of the wounded from Paardeberg Drift were transported to\r\nModder River in them.\r\n\r\nOne other advantage of these wagons, the possibility of converting them\r\ninto an excellent laager, is not to be underrated. Any one who saw the\r\ncomfortable encampment which a naval contingent on the march made by\r\nmassing the wagons with intervals covered by macintosh sheets, could at\r\nonce appreciate their capabilities for a long trek.\r\n\r\nTraction engines were, as far as I know, never employed as a means of\r\ntransporting the sick. The tendency of these heavy machines to stick in\r\nthe mud and to break down bridges is so well known that it hardly needs\r\nmention. Putting these disadvantages on one side, with a supply of fuel\r\nensured, and such roads as are afforded by a civilised country, a great\r\nfuture is probably before this means of transport for the wounded. A\r\nlarge number of patients might be carried at an even pace, and the camps\r\nwould be saved all the trouble and worry of the transport animals.\r\n\r\n_Trains._--In many cases in Natal, and in a few instances on the western\r\nside, the wounded men were able to be transferred from the first\r\ndressing station directly into the trains. Space will not allow me to\r\ndescribe any of those in use, but the accompanying illustration shows\r\nthe general arrangement of the beds in Nos. 2 and 3 trains (fig. 9). The\r\ncarriages were converted from ordinary bogie wagons of the Cape\r\nGovernment Railway stock under the supervision of Colonel Supple,\r\nR.A.M.C., P.M.O. of the Base at Cape Town. Each train was provided with\r\naccommodation for two medical officers, two nursing Sisters, orderlies,\r\na kitchen, and a dispensary, and each carried some 120 patients. The\r\ntrains were under the charge of Major Russell, R.A.M.C., and Dr. Boswell\r\n(and later other civilian medical officers) and of Captain Fleming,\r\nR.A.M.C., D.S.O., and Mr. Waters, and carried many thousand patients\r\nfrom all parts of the country to the Base and Station hospitals. They\r\nwere most admirably worked, and seemed to offer little scope for\r\nimprovement except in minor details. To them much of the success in the\r\ntreatment of the wounded who had to traverse the immense distances\r\nincident to South Africa must be attributed. I made many pleasant\r\njourneys in each of them. Later, two additional trains, Nos. 4 and 5, of\r\na similar nature, were added. Two trains, No. 1, and the Princess\r\nChristian train, which I was not fortunate enough to see, performed\r\nsimilar duties for Natal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Interior of one of the Wagons of No. 2 Hospital\r\nTrain]\r\n\r\n_Hospital Ships._--These were numerous and some especially well\r\narranged. Fig. 10 is of the 'Simla,' a P. & O. vessel which was\r\nadmirably adapted to the requirements of a hospital ship. On her main\r\ndeck some 250 patients were accommodated in a series of wards all on the\r\nsame level, which much lightened the difficulties of service usually\r\nexperienced. During the present campaign the abundance of transport\r\nvessels rendered the transhipment of patients to England a matter of\r\ncomparative ease, and good vessels were always available. Considering\r\nthe constant transhipment of invalids from India and our other colonial\r\npossessions, it would seem advisable that, in place of having to\r\nhurriedly improvise hospital ships, the Government should possess two or\r\nthree hospital ships of the 'Simla' type. It is true this would deprive\r\nour naval transport officers of a duty which in this war was performed\r\nwith extraordinary celerity and success; thus the 'Simla' was fitted in\r\nseven days, and sailed with a cargo of invalids ten days after her\r\narrival at Durban; but on the other hand it would ensure that really\r\nsuitable vessels were always provided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--P. & O. Hospital Ship 'Simla' in Durban\r\nHarbour]\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the amount of work contingent on the transport of\r\nwounded men from an army of some 15,000, fighting its way against\r\ncontinued opposition, I will quote the approximate number of men moved\r\nduring Lord Methuen's advance from Orange River to Magersfontein. (The\r\nnumber of men actually present at each battle is shown in Table I., p.\r\n12.)\r\n\r\nBelmont, the first battle, was fought on November 23.\r\n\r\n_November 24._--No. 2 hospital train removed 152 cases to the Stationary\r\nField hospitals at Orange River, then returned and loaded up with 130\r\nmore. Some of the most severe cases in the latter were detrained at\r\nOrange River, and the remainder were taken direct to Wynberg (591-1/2\r\nmiles).\r\n\r\nThe division marched, and the battle of Graspan was fought during the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n_November 26._--A train of specially constructed trucks brought 90 of\r\nthe less severe cases, including 20 Boers, to Orange River.\r\n\r\n_November 27._--The division marched, and in the morning No. 3 hospital\r\ntrain removed 80 severe cases from the Field hospitals direct to\r\nWynberg.\r\n\r\n_November 28._--Battle of Modder River.\r\n\r\n_November 29._--339 patients, including a few sick, and some wounded\r\nBoers, were sent down to Orange River in open trucks with impromptu\r\nshelters made with rifles and blankets.\r\n\r\nLater, 97 severe cases were sent down in ordinary carriages, of which\r\nsome had doors sawn out to admit lying-down patients.\r\n\r\n_December 10._--The division marched, and on the next day the battle of\r\nMagersfontein was fought.\r\n\r\n_December 11._--Nos. 2 and 3 trains were loaded up during the night and\r\nearly morning of the 12th, in part from the Field hospitals, in part\r\ndirectly from the Ambulance wagons. During the day of the 12th, No. 3\r\ntrain made three journeys to Orange River, and No. 2 was sent direct to\r\nWynberg.\r\n\r\nIn all some 800 patients needed transport; they were picked up by 10\r\nambulance wagons and 5 buck wagons for slighter cases and the two bearer\r\ncompanies sent out from Modder River. On the 12th Lord Methuen sent out\r\na number of bearers with stretchers, and at 12 noon all the wounded were\r\ncollected, but many had lain out through the night. The bearers had to\r\nretire under a shell fire kept up by the Boers as long as our army was\r\nwithin range of their position.\r\n\r\nFour Field hospitals were present, but only that of the IX. Brigade at\r\nModder River was so situated as to be of general use. This hospital,\r\nunder the command of Major Harris, R.A.M.C., did an immense amount of\r\nwork most expeditiously and with great success.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the advance on Kimberley necessitated the evacuation of\r\nthe Field hospitals with extreme promptitude, as the troops were in\r\nconstant action, and the arrangements for this were carried out with\r\ngreat success by Colonel Townsend, the P.M.O. of the First Division.\r\n\r\nThe amount of fighting far exceeded anything that had been expected, and\r\nthe Stationary hospitals on the lines of communication at Orange River\r\nand De Aar were unable to cope with the number of severe cases thrown on\r\ntheir hands, with the constant possibility of new arrivals. Hence a\r\nnumber of severe cases had to be sent direct to Wynberg.\r\n\r\nThis experience strongly illustrated the necessity of possessing\r\nStationary hospitals of greater mobility and a higher degree of\r\nequipment than the service at present possesses. In these a large number\r\nof severe cases could have been retained, and only the slighter ones\r\nexposed to the fatigue and general disadvantage of transport. In South\r\nAfrica very special difficulties existed in the length of the line of\r\ncommunication, the single line of rails, and the absence of any source\r\nof supply within 500 to 600 miles; but in any other country mobile\r\nStationary hospitals, although more easily equipped, would be equally\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of transport experienced in the advance of the\r\nKimberley Relief Force were many times multiplied in that upon\r\nBloemfontein, since the whole of the severely wounded men had to be sent\r\nback thirty to forty miles to the railway. The ambulance accommodation\r\non the occasion of this march, although, if untouched, proportionately\r\nsmaller than that possessed by Lord Methuen, was reduced to one-fifth to\r\nmeet the exigencies of warfare. Beyond this the equipment transport of\r\nthe Field hospitals was reduced from four ox-wagons to two, and the\r\nScotch cart was cut off, only two ox-wagons and the two water-carts\r\nbeing allowed. This greatly hampered the Field hospitals on the march,\r\nand when they arrived at Bloemfontein and had to undertake the work of\r\nStationary hospitals, their efficiency was seriously impaired. Again, on\r\nthe advance from Bloemfontein to Kroonstadt many of the Field hospitals\r\nwere unable to accompany their respective divisions, not alone on\r\naccount of the number of patients remaining in them, but also because\r\nthe mule transport had been otherwise employed for military purposes.\r\n\r\nThe transport of the ambulances and hospitals stands in a very special\r\nposition. As far as my experience went, neither ambulances nor hospitals\r\nwere ever taken or retained by the Boers, and consequently the transport\r\nanimals originally devoted to this purpose should have been held sacred\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n_Hospitals._--Accommodation for the wounded was provided under canvas in\r\nthe Field hospitals, also in the large General hospitals. Beyond this\r\niron huts were erected in many of the Base and Station hospitals. At\r\nCapetown, Maritzburg, and Ladysmith barrack huts were modified and\r\nequipped as hospitals, and in towns such as Bloemfontein, Kimberley, and\r\nJohannesburg large civil hospitals were at our disposal. Beyond these\r\nsources of accommodation, churches, schools, public institutions, and\r\nprivate houses were made use of in the smaller towns.\r\n\r\nAs to the broad question of canvas _v._ buildings, experience amply\r\nshowed that in a climate such as is possessed by South Africa, canvas\r\naffords the greater advantages. The hospitals are more mobile, more\r\nreadily extended, and the more healthy. Except under unusual conditions\r\nof rain and dust, the patients did excellently in the tents.\r\n\r\nRain and dust were occasionally most troublesome, especially when\r\ncombined with wind. I once saw a whole hospital, fortunately unoccupied,\r\nlevelled to the ground in the course of some twenty minutes. Under such\r\ncircumstances iron huts present advantages, and were on many occasions\r\nutilised with much success. They are readily erected, and it would have\r\nbeen a considerable improvement if a number of them had been ready for\r\nuse at the earliest part of the campaign. Except in the matter of\r\nweight, they possess in a considerable degree the advantage of mobility\r\npossessed by canvas, and in addition they offer much more protection\r\nfrom the weather. On the other hand, they are more liable to become\r\nunhealthy from prolonged use.\r\n\r\nChurches and public institutions were mainly troublesome from the\r\nnecessity of having to improvise sanitary arrangements, and sometimes\r\nthe disadvantage of the collection of a large number of men in one\r\nchamber could not be avoided. None the less I cannot look back without\r\nadmiration on the temporary hospitals established in the Raadzaal at\r\nBloemfontein, and the Irish hospital in the Palace of Justice in\r\nPretoria.\r\n\r\nThe State schools in the smaller towns of the Orange River Colony also\r\nafforded excellent accommodation as small temporary hospitals.\r\n\r\nPrivate houses, possessing the disadvantages of ill-adapted construction\r\nand the necessity of a considerably increased staff to work them, were\r\non the whole little used as hospitals. The scattered farmhouses\r\noccasionally afforded shelter to very severely wounded men. In most of\r\nthe country I traversed, however, the farms were so wide apart as to be\r\nof little use in this respect; and again, under the special\r\ncircumstances, patients left in them might have to be abandoned to the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest during the campaign centred in the working of the\r\nField and General hospitals.\r\n\r\nTwo types of Field hospital were employed, one the Home, the other the\r\nIndian. The latter differs from the Home in that in it the bearer\r\ncompany is attached and consists of Indian natives, and that the\r\nhospital is separable into four sections in place of two only.\r\n\r\nThe amalgamation of the Field hospital and bearer company into one unit\r\nis much to be desired in the Home service, both for economy of working\r\nand the more equal distribution of duties to the medical officers\r\nengaged. Again the divisibility of the hospital into four sections is\r\nalso an advantage. It allows of the advance or the leaving of sections,\r\nin the case of either small expeditions or the presence of a number of\r\nseverely wounded men unfit to travel. As far as I could judge, it\r\nnecessitates very small addition to the present equipment, and is in\r\nevery way desirable.\r\n\r\nAs to the working of the Field hospitals in the present campaign, it\r\nwas universally acknowledged to possess a very high degree of\r\nexcellence. The equipment, with small exceptions, proved equal to the\r\ndemands made upon it. The mobility of the camps was proved again and\r\nagain, and the rules governing their administration evidenced by their\r\neffectiveness the care and experience which have been bestowed on the\r\norganisation of the hospitals.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for any one who has not had an opportunity of observing\r\nthe actual amount of work performed in the Field hospitals either to\r\nappreciate the storm and stress following an important engagement when\r\nthe wounded men are first brought in, or the demands that are made on\r\nthe powers of the medical officers in charge. To a civilian the first\r\nfeeling is one of impotence, followed by an attempt to see no further\r\nthan the case under immediate observation, and to nurture the conviction\r\nthat the work is to be got through if it is only stuck to. I gathered\r\nthat this first impression was absent in the minds of the officers in\r\ncharge of the Field hospitals, as work commenced at once, and was\r\ncarried on without intermission during the persistence of daylight, in\r\nthe winter often by the aid of lanterns, and eventually the huge task\r\nwas accomplished. In early days at Orange River work commenced at 4\r\nA.M., and was steadily continued until 6 P.M. or later, and this state\r\nof things persisted sometimes for many days together.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Field hospitals, the bearer companies, and those\r\ndoing regimental duty carried out their duties with a calmness and\r\nefficiency which not only impressed observers like myself, but also\r\nexcited the admiration of our German colleagues sent by their government\r\nto observe the working of the British system.\r\n\r\nI saw on several occasions the German and Dutch ambulances, and was much\r\nstruck by the excellence of their equipment. In some details there was\r\nmuch to be learned from them, especially in the matter of appliances,\r\ndressings, and instruments. The Dutch ambulance I saw at Brandfort had a\r\ncomplete installation of acetylene gas, which was carried, gasometer and\r\nall, in one Scotch cart. They were, however, really designed to fill the\r\ncombined position of our Field, Stationary, and General hospitals, and\r\nwhen it became necessary for them to move about frequently, the inferior\r\nmobility they possessed in comparison with our own Field hospitals was\r\nat once demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe large General hospitals of 500 beds were a great feature in the\r\ncampaign. Although designed and organised some time since, the present\r\nwas the first occasion on which they have come into general use, and\r\nthey may be said to have actually been on trial. The organisation of\r\nthese hospitals proved itself excellent, and in the case of the best of\r\nthem left little to be desired.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the accommodation was temporarily strained enormously, and\r\nthe number of patients was extended beyond more than three times the\r\nregulation limit. The additional patients were then accommodated in\r\nmarquees and bell tents, according to the nature of their diseases.\r\nUnder these circumstances the working of the hospitals was difficult,\r\nand the officers both of the R.A.M.C. and the civilian surgeons were\r\nplaced at a great disadvantage.\r\n\r\nMy space does not allow me to give any description of the general\r\narrangement of these hospitals, but I would suggest that a certain\r\nnumber of them should be so modified as to increase their mobility and\r\nallow of their being more readily utilised as Stationary hospitals.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole campaign it seemed to me that the Stationary hospitals\r\n(that is to say, the hospitals necessary to receive patients when the\r\nField hospitals were rapidly evacuated), were those in which some\r\nincreased uniformity of organisation was most needed.\r\n\r\nIt scarcely needs to be pointed out that this is the most difficult link\r\nof the whole hospital chain to be uniformly well organised and equipped.\r\nIt is needed at short notice, and often for a short period, and it is\r\ndifficult to maintain a regular staff of officers ready for any\r\nemergency without keeping a certain number of men idle.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of Field hospitals to Stationary purposes is undesirable,\r\nas the troops move with only a regulation number of the former, which\r\nunder ordinary circumstances is the minimum that may be necessary.\r\n\r\nStationary hospitals as individual units are undesirable for the reasons\r\nabove given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Type of a General Hospital (No. VIII.\r\nBloemfontein) extended by use of bell tents in the distance. (Photo by\r\nMr. C. S. Wallace)]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty might be met by increasing the mobility of a certain\r\nnumber of the General hospitals, by making them divisible into five\r\nsections, each of which should be able to move independently, and to the\r\nlast of which should be attached the heavy part of the equipment, such\r\nas the iron huts for operating and X-ray rooms, kitchens, store sheds,\r\n&c. The tents might also be lightened by the substitution of the\r\ntortoise tent for the service marquee. The tortoise tent is lighter (360\r\nas against 500 lbs.), easily pitched and moved, and holds at least two\r\nmore patients with ease. The capabilities of this tent were amply proven\r\nduring its use by the Portland, Irish, and other civil hospitals\r\nattached to the army. It withstood wind and weather, the former better\r\nthan the service marquee. Figs. 11 and 12 show the appearance of camps\r\ncomposed of the two varieties. I must admit a warm preference for the\r\nappearance of the service pattern, but I think it is indubitable that\r\nthe other is the more useful.\r\n\r\nGiven the possibility of division of a General hospital in this manner,\r\nsingle sections could readily be sent up the lines of communication to\r\nserve as Stationary hospitals at various points behind the advance of\r\nthe troops, and on the cessation of active need, the sections could be\r\nreunited at any point to form an advanced Base hospital. The sections\r\ncould be kept in touch throughout by visits from the officer of the\r\nlines of communication. This would appear a ready means of providing\r\nwell-organised Stationary hospitals at short notice, and would save the\r\ndisadvantage of a definitely separate series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Type of Tortoise Tent Hospital.

Wallace)]\r\n\r\nSuch hospitals might have been used on many occasions when the transport\r\nof an entire General hospital was an impossibility. The service,\r\nmoreover, has some experience in this direction, since at one time No. 3\r\nGeneral Hospital was divided into two definite sections.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the extreme readiness and promptitude with which the\r\nofficers during the present campaign extended the accommodation of\r\neither Field or General hospitals, one of such sections as are proposed\r\nmight readily be made far more capacious than its regulation number\r\nwould suggest.\r\n\r\nMy duties being entirely in connection with the service hospitals, I did\r\nnot become intimately acquainted with any of the volunteer hospitals\r\nwhich did such excellent service, except the Portland, to the staff of\r\nwhich I was indebted for much hospitality and kindness. This hospital\r\nwas practically of about the capacity proposed for the above-mentioned\r\nsections, and the report of its work will no doubt furnish many points\r\nof detail as to equipment, &c., which may be useful.\r\n\r\nThe general results of the surgical work done during the campaign were\r\nexcellent, and taken as a whole the occurrence of any severe form of\r\nseptic disease was unusual.\r\n\r\nPure septicaemia, especially in connection with abdominal injuries,\r\nsevere head injuries and secondary to acute traumatic osteo-myelitis,\r\nwas the form most commonly seen. Pyaemia with secondary deposits was\r\nuncommon, and often of a somewhat subacute form; thus I saw several\r\npatients recover after secondary abscesses had been opened, or the\r\nprimary focus of infection removed. The only really acute case of joint\r\npyaemia I heard of, developed in connection with a blistered toe followed\r\nby cellulitis of the foot.\r\n\r\nCutaneous erysipelas I never happened to see, and really acute\r\nphlegmonous inflammation was rare.\r\n\r\nI may mention the occurrence of acute traumatic gangrene in two cases.\r\nThis developed in each instance with gunshot fracture of the femur; in\r\none amputation was performed, and the process extended upwards on to the\r\nabdomen. The cases occurred with the army in the field in the\r\nneighbourhood of Thaba-nchu and not in a stationary hospital.\r\n\r\nAcute traumatic tetanus occurred only in one instance to my knowledge.\r\nIn this case the primary injury was a shell wound of the thigh, and the\r\npatient developed the disease and died within ten days.\r\n\r\nTo the civil surgeon the performance of operations, and the dressing of\r\nsevere wounds at the front, proved on occasions a somewhat trying\r\nordeal.\r\n\r\nWhen operations were necessary in the field, during the daytime, it was\r\noften possible to perform them in the open air, provided tolerable\r\nprotection could be obtained from the sun. A number of cases were so\r\noperated upon during the march of the Highland Brigade from Wynberg to\r\nHeilbron, and gave excellent results, the patients deriving considerable\r\nbenefit from the early cleansing and closure of the wounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Tortoise Hospital Tent. Portland Hospital.\r\n(Photo by Mr. C. S. Wallace)]\r\n\r\nIn camp, in the Field, or Stationary hospitals, the difficulties were\r\noften much greater. The operations were necessarily performed under\r\nshelter for reasons of privacy. In the tents the draught carrying the\r\ndust from the camp was one of the commonest troubles. The exclusion of\r\ndust was impossible, and it not only found its way into open wounds, but\r\npermeated bandages with ease. Often when a bandage was removed, an even\r\nlayer of dust moistened by perspiration covered the whole area included\r\nwith a coating of mud. Again, in dust storms a similar layer of mud\r\nsometimes covered the whole of the exposed parts of the bodies of\r\npatients lying on the ground in the tents.\r\n\r\nIt is of some interest to remark with regard to this dust, that Dr. L.\r\nL. Jenner lately kindly examined a specimen collected at Modder River\r\nafter the camp had been more than two months established, and discovered\r\nno pathogenic organisms in it. As a period of seven months had elapsed\r\nsince this dust was collected, the fact is of no practical import,\r\nbeyond showing that, if such organisms had existed, at any rate they\r\nwere not of a resistent nature.\r\n\r\nInsects, particularly common house-flies, were an intolerable pest at\r\ntimes. In a fresh camp they were sometimes not abundant, but after two\r\nor three days they multiplied enormously. Not only hospital tents, but\r\nliving and mess tents, swarmed with them, the canvas appearing\r\npositively black at night. Even when dressing a wound, without unceasing\r\npassage of the hand across the part, it was impossible to keep them from\r\nsettling, and during operations the nuisance was much greater.\r\n\r\nStorms of rain were occasionally as troublesome as, though perhaps less\r\nharmful than, those of dust. On one occasion a whole Field hospital was\r\nflooded only a few hours after a number of important operations had been\r\nperformed, and the patients were practically washed out of the tents. It\r\nwas somewhat remarkable that none of the men suffered any serious ill as\r\na result.\r\n\r\nAt times the temperature was sufficiently high to make either dressing\r\nor operating a most exhausting process to the surgeon. The heat of the\r\nday was not on the whole so disadvantageous from the point of view of\r\nthe operator, as the cold of the nights during the winter in Orange\r\nRiver Colony. On one or two occasions serious operations had to be left\r\nundone, as it was only possible to consider them in camp, where, as we\r\narrived at night only, the temperature was too low to justify the\r\nnecessary exposure.\r\n\r\nWater for use at operations was often a great difficulty. Even at Orange\r\nRiver, where, though muddy, the water was wholesome, it was impossible\r\nto get water suitable for operations unless it had previously gone\r\nthrough the complicated processes of precipitation by alum, boiling, and\r\nfiltration. At Orange River a small room in the house of one of the\r\nrailway servants was obtained and fitted as a rough operating room by\r\nthe Royal Engineers. The necessary utensils were provided by Colonel\r\nYoung, Commissioner of the Red Cross Societies. Here a stock of prepared\r\nwater was kept for emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe remaining difficulties mainly consisted in those we are familiar\r\nwith in civil practice, such as the securing of suitable assistance in\r\nthe handling of instruments and dressing, when the rush of work was very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nAt the Base hospitals accommodation for operating in properly equipped\r\nrooms obviated many of the difficulties above referred to.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this introduction I should sum up in a few words my\r\nexperience of the general working of the hospital system during my stay\r\nin South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of the Field hospitals for their purpose has been already\r\nalluded to, and, as far as I could ascertain, won the confidence and\r\napproval of patients, military commanders, and civilians such as myself.\r\n\r\nThe Stationary hospitals (by which I intend to indicate those receiving\r\nthe patients directly from the Field hospitals before the establishment\r\nof advanced Base hospitals), as already indicated, were not in my\r\nopinion so perfectly conceived or organised. The requirements of these\r\nare, however, far greater than those of the Field hospitals, and they of\r\nall others are dependent on the possession of facilities for rapid\r\ntransport. In South Africa the difficulties of supplying them were\r\nenormous, and no doubt the conditions of the campaign in this, as so\r\nmany other particulars, were novel and unusual. None the less the\r\nexperience gained will no doubt be utilised in the future. With regard\r\nto the extravagant criticisms levelled at the Field hospitals serving as\r\nStationary hospitals at the time of the early period of the occupation\r\nof Bloemfontein, it may be pointed out that the only proper ground for\r\ncomparison was not between the patients at Bloemfontein and those in\r\nhospital at the base, but between the men in hospital and those in the\r\nfield at that time, since the conditions were equally adverse to both.\r\nBesides, it must not be forgotten that a large proportion of the\r\npatients, at that time, were really comfortably housed in the Raadzaal\r\nand other buildings, the preparation of which entailed a very great\r\namount of both labour and resource.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties experienced at that time will, it is hoped, go far\r\ntowards securing greater facilities and rights of transport to the Royal\r\nArmy Medical Corps in the future. As a civilian, one cannot but\r\nrecognise that the conditions of modern warfare are much altered from\r\nthose of the past. Prisoners are well cared for and kindly treated, the\r\nsick and wounded are respected by both sides, and except in the actual\r\nhorrors of fighting the condition of the soldier is a happier one. Under\r\nthese circumstances the limitation of the transport facilities of a\r\ndepartment so closely concerned with the well-being of all, and which\r\nhas been organised on a most moderate scale, must soon become a\r\ntradition of the past in civilised armies.\r\n\r\nAs to the efficiency of the organisation of the General hospitals,\r\neither at the advanced or actual base, I have already testified.\r\nNaturally the working of these hospitals varied with the personal\r\nequation of the officer in charge of them, but as a whole the service\r\nhas every reason to be proud of their success. As far as surgical\r\nresults are concerned, and with these I had special acquaintance, the\r\nsuccess of the hospitals was amply demonstrated.\r\n\r\nAdverse criticism was not however wanting, and often expressed in the\r\nstrongest terms by persons totally unacquainted with hospital methods,\r\nand apparently unconscious that such excellence as is exhibited in a\r\nLondon hospital is the result of continuous work and development for\r\nsome centuries, and that such institutions are worked by committees and\r\nstaffs of permanent constitution.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of female nurses employed in these hospitals underwent\r\nsteady increase from the commencement of the campaign, and the immense\r\nvalue of the nursing reserve was fully proved. There is no doubt that in\r\nBase hospitals the actual nursing should always be entrusted to women.\r\n\r\nThe demands of the campaign necessitated the employment of a large\r\nnumber of civil surgeons in the various hospitals. These gentlemen\r\naccommodated themselves with true British aptitude to the conditions\r\nunder which they were placed, and in all positions their sterling work\r\ncontributed in no small degree to the success that was attained.\r\n\r\nOne class of hospital still remains for mention. I refer to the\r\nimprovised hospitals prepared in the Boer towns prior to the British\r\noccupation. They were met with in all the smaller towns, and also in the\r\nlarger ones such as Johannesburg and Pretoria.\r\n\r\nThe Burke hospital in Pretoria, started by a private citizen and his\r\ndaughter, and the Victoria hospital in Johannesburg, presided over by\r\nDr. and Mrs. Murray, were two of the largest, but each and all deserve\r\ndue recognition.\r\n\r\nI am sure that many of our wounded officers and men who were cared for\r\nin these hospitals while prisoners in the hands of the Boers, will never\r\nlose their sense of gratitude to those inhabitants who spared no effort\r\nto render their position as happy as possible under the circumstances;\r\nand the existence of these hospitals was no small boon to the service\r\nwhen called upon to take charge of the sick and wounded therein\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nI cannot close this chapter without recognition of the immensity of the\r\ntask which has fallen on the Royal Army Medical Corps in the treatment\r\nof the sick and wounded during the course of the campaign and full\r\nappreciation of the manner in which that task has been met. The strain\r\nthrown upon this department of the service, originally organised for the\r\nneeds of an army less than half the magnitude of that eventually taking\r\nthe field, was incalculably great, and the medical profession may well\r\nbe proud of the efforts made by its military representatives to do the\r\nbest possible work under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] 3,328 men of the IX. Brigade present are not included, as they never\r\ncame into action.\r\n\r\n[2] The high mortality was due to deaths amongst the officers of the\r\nNaval Brigade.\r\n\r\n[3] To obtain this total the numbers of killed, wounded, and missing,\r\nafter the three earlier battles, have been massed, and added to the\r\ntotal number of men known to have taken part in the battle of\r\nMagersfontein. The inaccuracy dependent on the fact that some of the men\r\nreported as wounded or missing in the earlier battles had already\r\nreturned to their regiments, and are included in the total of 11,447,\r\nmust be disregarded.\r\n\r\n[4] Numbers quoted from Fischer, _Handbuch der Kriegschirurgie_, vol. i.\r\np. 22, 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMODERN MILITARY RIFLES AND THEIR PROJECTILES IN RELATION TO INJURIES\r\nPRODUCED BY THEM ON THE HUMAN BODY\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the actual description of the wounds inflicted by\r\nmodern military rifles, it is necessary to prefix a few remarks on the\r\nmechanism and mode of production of these injuries.\r\n\r\nRecent tendency in the construction of military rifles has been in the\r\ndirection of reduction of bore, and a corresponding one in the calibre\r\nof the bullet, the resulting loss of weight in the latter as an element\r\nin striking power being compensated for by the attainment of an\r\naugmentation of velocity in the flight of the projectile, and a\r\ncomparatively flat trajectory.\r\n\r\nChanges in this direction have endowed the weapons with increase both in\r\nrange and accuracy of fire; while the greater rapidity with which\r\nmagazine rifles can be discharged and, in consequence of reduction in\r\nweight, the greater number of cartridges which can be carried by each\r\nman, also form important factors in the possible deadliness of warfare\r\nat the present day. None the less the experience of the present campaign\r\nhas scarcely justified the early prognostications expressed as to a\r\ngreat increase in the number and severity of wounds amongst the\r\ncombatants.[5] This comparative immunity is to be explained mainly on\r\ntwo grounds. The increased distance which for the most part separated\r\nthe two bodies of men, a feature no doubt accentuated by the mode of\r\nwarfare adopted by the Boer, and his strong sense of the folly of close\r\ncombat on equal terms, tended to efface one of the chief characters,\r\nvelocity of flight, on the part of the projectile. The want of\r\neffectiveness of the small-calibre bullet as an instrument of serious\r\nmischief also kept down the mortality.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1889 the calibre of the bullet in our own army has been\r\nreduced from that of the Martini-Henry (.450 in.) to one of .309 in. in\r\nthe Lee-Metford, and a consequent reduction in weight from 480 to 215\r\ngrains. To allow of the satisfactory assumption of the more complicated\r\nrifling by the more rapidly projected bullet, the lead core has been\r\nensheathed in a mantle of denser metal. The bullet itself is of an\r\noriginal calibre (.309 in.) somewhat exceeding the bore of the rifle\r\nbarrel (.303 in.), in which way a species of 'choke' is obtained and\r\ndeep rifling of the surface ensured. Beyond this the comparative\r\ntransverse and longitudinal measurements and shape have been altered in\r\norder to maintain weight, preserve a proper balance during flight, and\r\nincrease the power of penetration. These alterations with slight\r\ndifferences in detail embody the general principles that underlie the\r\nconstruction of each of the weapons adopted by European nations. It will\r\nbe well here to consider the influence of each alteration from the point\r\nof view of the surgeon.\r\n\r\n_Calibre._--The effect of the diminution of calibre is (_a_) to reduce\r\nthe area of impact of the bullet on the part impinged upon, and hence to\r\nlower the degree of resistance offered by the tissues; this to a certain\r\nextent tends to neutralise the augmented striking force resulting from\r\nthe increased velocity of flight. (_b_) To limit considerably the\r\ndestructive powers of the bullet, as a smaller area of tissue is exposed\r\nto its action. (_c_) To allow of the production of very 'neat' injuries\r\nand the frequent escape of important structures, also the production of\r\nremarkably prolonged subcutaneous tracks in positions where such would\r\nbe regarded as scarcely possible, and in point of fact were impossible\r\nwith the older and larger projectiles.\r\n\r\n_Length._--The comparative increase in length of the bullet is, from the\r\nsurgical point of view, only of material importance in increasing the\r\nweight and therefore the striking power, and in so far as it is a\r\nmechanical necessity for the flight of the projectile on an axis\r\nparallel to its long diameter, and so tends to ensure impact on the\r\nbody by the tip of the bullet. This latter is, however, surgically\r\nfavourable as ensuring a smaller wound.\r\n\r\n_Weight._--The decrease in weight must be regarded on the whole as\r\naltogether to the advantage of the wounded individual, since it cannot\r\nbe considered to be entirely compensated for by the resulting increased\r\nvelocity of flight, unless the range of fire is moderately close.\r\n\r\n_Shape._--The ogival tip and general wedge-like outline, while\r\ndecreasing the aerial resistance to and increasing the power of\r\npenetration possessed by the bullet, at the same time allow the escape\r\nof some structures by displacement, while others are saved from complete\r\ndestruction by undergoing perforation. Beyond this the sharper the tip,\r\nthe smaller is the area of the body primarily impinged upon, the less\r\nthe resistance offered to perforation, and to some degree the less the\r\ndestruction of surrounding tissues.\r\n\r\n_Increased velocity of flight._--This multiplies the striking force, and\r\ncompensates in part for decrease in volume and weight of the bullet. It\r\nis customary to speak of the velocity as 'initial' and 'remaining.'\r\nInitial velocity is the term employed to express the velocity at the\r\ntime of the escape of the bullet from the barrel; this is also\r\ndesignated as 'muzzle velocity.' 'Remaining velocity' expresses that\r\nobtaining during any subsequent portion of the flight of the projectile.\r\n\r\nThe greatest initial velocity is obtained with the use of bullets of the\r\nsmallest calibre, but this is not of the practical importance which\r\nmight be assumed, since the remaining velocity of flight of such\r\nprojectiles falls more rapidly than that of those of slightly greater\r\nmass. Thus, although there may be a difference of a hundred metres per\r\nsecond in initial velocity between two rifles of calibres varying from\r\n6.5 to 8 millimetres (.303-.314 in.), at the end of 1,000 metres the\r\ndiscrepancy is greatly reduced, while at 2,000 metres it hardly exists.\r\nUnder such circumstances the projectile of greater weight and volume, as\r\npossessing the greater striking force, is considerably the more\r\nformidable of the two. This is the more important if it be allowed, as I\r\nbelieve to be the case, that velocity _per se_ is of no practical import\r\nin the case of wounds of the soft parts of the body, which after all\r\nform the preponderating number of all gunshot injuries. The effect of\r\nthe higher degrees of velocity differs, however, with the amount of\r\nresistance met with on the part of the body; hence its serious import is\r\nwell exemplified when parts of the osseous skeleton are implicated,\r\nalthough even here considerable variations exist, dependent upon the\r\nstructure of that part of the bone actually involved. The most obvious\r\nill effect of injuries from bullets travelling at high rates is seen in\r\nthe case of the various parts of the nervous system, and here it is\r\nundeniable. High velocity and striking force are also responsible for\r\nthe prolonged course sometimes taken by bullets through the body.\r\n\r\nThe actual degree of velocity, as judged by the range of fire at which\r\nan injury is received and the resulting injury, is very hard to estimate\r\non account of the many and varying factors which enter into its\r\ndetermination. The mere recital of some of these will suffice to make\r\nthis evident.\r\n\r\n1. Quality of the individual cartridge employed, as to loading, the\r\nmaterials employed, and their condition.\r\n\r\n2. The condition of the rifle as to cleanliness, heating, and the state\r\nof the grooves of the barrel.\r\n\r\n3. The angle of impact of the bullet with the part injured.\r\n\r\n4. Resistance dependent on the weight of the whole body of the man\r\nstruck, or of an isolated limb.\r\n\r\n5. Special peculiarities of build in the individual struck, such as\r\nthickness and density of the integument and fasciae, strength and\r\nthickness of the bones, &c.\r\n\r\n6. State of tension of the muscles, fasciae, and ligaments at the moment\r\nof impact, and fixity or otherwise of the part of the body struck.\r\n\r\n7. The degree of wind, temperature, and hygroscopic conditions of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThese form some of the more important points which have to be taken into\r\nconsideration, in addition to a mere calculation of the actual distance\r\nfrom which a wound has been received from a particular rifle, and taken\r\nwith the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence as to the latter, which\r\nis usually alone obtainable, it is clear that definite assumptions are\r\nscarcely possible. In a great number of cases I came to the conclusion\r\nthat the only indisputable evidence of low velocity was the lodgment of\r\nan undeformed bullet. There is little doubt, moreover, that the general\r\ntendency of wounded men was to minimise the range of fire at which they\r\nwere struck, and again that in the majority of cases in this campaign it\r\nwas quite impossible to determine whence any particular bullet had come,\r\nsince the enemy was seldom arranged in one line, but rather in several.\r\nAgain, smokeless powder was generally employed. Beyond this, in some\r\ncases where there was no doubt of the short distance from which the\r\nbullet was fired, the wounds were due to 'ricochet' of portions of\r\nbroken-up bullets. The following instance well illustrates this. A\r\nsentry fired five times at two men within a distance of six paces,\r\nknocking both down. One man received a severe direct fracture of the\r\nilium, the bullet entering between the anterior superior and inferior\r\niliac spines and emerging at the upper part of the buttock. The entry\r\nand exit apertures were large but hardly 'explosive,' as a subcutaneous\r\ntrack four to five inches long separated them. Besides this both men had\r\nother lesser injuries; thus in the second two perforating wounds of the\r\narm existed. The latter were not unlike type Lee-Metford wounds, and\r\nwere regarded as such until a few days afterwards when a hard body was\r\nfelt in the distal portion of one track and removed. This proved to be a\r\npart of the leaden core only, and the similar wound had no doubt been\r\nproduced by a like fragment, the bullet having broken up on striking the\r\nstony ground.\r\n\r\n_Trajectory._--The comparative flatness of this depends on the\r\nconstruction of the rifle and the propulsive force employed, and varies\r\nas does velocity with the nature, excellence, and amount of the\r\nexplosive, the correctness of the principles upon which the bullet is\r\ndevised, and the mechanical perfection of its manufacture. Its\r\nimportance naturally consists in the manner in which it affects the\r\npossibility of covering objects on a wide area of ground and thus\r\ncreating a broad 'dangerous zone.' A bullet fired on level ground from\r\nany one of three of the rifles referred to later (Lee-Metford, Mauser,\r\nKrag-Joergensen), sighted to 500 yards and fired from the shoulder in\r\nthe standing position, will cover some part of an erect man of average\r\nheight during the whole extent of its flight. A body of men within that\r\ndistance is therefore in a position of extreme peril in the face of a\r\ngood shooting enemy.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a flat trajectory is progressively lost, however, with\r\nany rifle, as the weapon is gradually sighted to greater distances. Thus\r\nwhen sighted to 2,000 yards the bullet from the Lee-Metford rifle rises\r\n174 feet, and a whole army might comfortably be situated over a\r\nconsiderable area within that distance. The importance of flatness of\r\ntrajectory is also influenced by the nature of the ground occupied by\r\nthe combatants. Thus when the area to be covered consists in ground\r\nfirst rising then falling from the rifleman, the trajectory will become\r\nmore or less parallel to the surface crossed, and the 'dangerous zone'\r\nwill be correspondingly increased in extent. On the other hand, when the\r\nground slopes away from the rifleman the rise of the projectile is\r\nexaggerated, and reaches its most limited capacity of covering an\r\nintervening space when the flight crosses a hollow.\r\n\r\n_Revolution of the bullet._--It only remains in this place to say a few\r\nwords concerning the revolution imparted to the bullet by the rifling of\r\nthe barrel. This ensures the flight of the projectile on a line parallel\r\nto its long axis, and notably increases its power of penetration.\r\n\r\nBoth these properties of the flight are to the advantage of the wounded,\r\nsince, as already mentioned, the more exactly the impact corresponds to\r\na right angle with the skin, the more limited will be the area of\r\ncontusion, even if it be of the most severe character, while to the\r\ntwist of the bullet must be ascribed a not inconsiderable part in the\r\nexplanation of the ready and neat perforations of narrow structures\r\nwhich are frequently produced.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that the Lee-Metford bullet turns on its own\r\naxis once in a distance of ten inches, while the Mauser revolves once in\r\na distance of eight and eleven-sixteenths inches; hence not more than at\r\nmost two revolutions are made in tracks crossing the trunk, and not more\r\nthan half a full revolution in the perforation of a limb. None the\r\nless, no one can deny the influence of the one half turn of supination\r\nin entering a perforating tool of any description, both as preventing\r\nsplintering, and in preserving the surrounding parts from damage.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, the spiral turn of the bullet, by diverting a part of the\r\ntransmitted vibrations into a second direction, must, in the case of\r\nwounds of the body, help to throw off contiguous structures, and while\r\nthose that are in actual contact are more severely contused, the\r\nsurrounding ones suffer somewhat less direct injury. It must be borne in\r\nmind, also, that rapidity of revolution does not fall _pari passu_ with\r\nthat of velocity of flight, but that the former undergoes a\r\ncomparatively slighter diminution until the bullet is actually spent.\r\nHence, the influence of revolution is felt, however low the velocity may\r\nbe, provided sufficient striking force is retained to enter the body. A\r\nword must be added here as to the surface of a discharged bullet; this,\r\nin taking the rifling of the barrel, becomes permanently grooved. The\r\ndepth of the groove differs with the variety of rifle. In the\r\nLee-Metford the grooves are deep (.009), in the Mauser slightly less so\r\n(.007), but the surface of both bullets is comparatively roughened when\r\nrevolving in the body, and this circumstance, since the projectile\r\nexactly fits its track, may influence the degree of the surface\r\ndestruction of tissue, and somewhat aid in the clean perforation of\r\nbone, since a little bone dust is always found at the entrance aperture\r\nof a canal in cancellous bone.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign many varieties of rifle projecting bullets of widely\r\ndiffering calibre were employed by the Boers, many of whom as sportsmen\r\npreferred the rifle to which they were accustomed to a regulation\r\nweapon, and an illustration of a large variety of bullets from\r\ncartridges which I collected from arsenals and camps is given below (p.\r\n96). The great majority of the men, however, were armed with\r\nsmall-calibre weapons of some sort, and as the wounds produced by these\r\nare of chief interest at the present day, I shall say little of any\r\nothers, beyond an occasional reference to Martini-Henry rifle wounds\r\nwhich may be considered to represent approximately those made by large\r\nleaden sporting bullets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Type Cartridges in common use during the war.\r\nFrom left to right: Martini-Henry, Guedes, Lee-Metford, (Spanish)\r\nMauser, Krag-Joergensen]\r\n\r\nThe most important, as the most frequently employed, rifles projecting\r\nsmall-calibre bullets were the Krag-Joergensen, Mauser, Lee-Metford, and\r\nGuedes, given in the order of increase of calibre (from 6.5 to 8\r\nmillimetres, or .254-.314 in.) in the bullets. As to the seriousness of\r\nwounds produced by these there is little to choose, differences in\r\ncharacter being only those of degree. Such differences depended on the\r\narea of tissue implicated, corresponding with the calibre of the\r\nparticular bullet, the comparative weight of the bullet, and the degree\r\nof velocity of flight maintained at the moment of impact. When, however,\r\nany of these bullets have been exposed in their flight to influences\r\ncapable of causing deformity of their outline and symmetry,\r\npeculiarities of construction and in the composition of the metals\r\nemployed in their manufacture may materially alter the character of the\r\nwounds produced and revolutionise a classification founded purely on the\r\nrelative weight, calibre, and degree of velocity with which each is\r\nendowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: table split to fit on

corresponding information regarding\r\nthe Martini-Henry for the purposes of comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II.--PENETRATION\r\n\r\nThe penetration of the Martini-Henry and the Lee-Metford or Lee-Enfield\r\nrifle with Mark II. bullet is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nMartini-Henry           15-1/2 in. of 1 in. deal boards  19 in. of sand\r\n                            1 in. apart                  containing 15 per\r\n                                                         cent. of moisture\r\n\r\nLee-Metford {Mark II.}  42 in. of 1 in. deal boards      60 in. of sand\r\nLee-Enfield {bullet  }      1 in. apart                  containing 15 per\r\n                                                         cent. of moisture\r\n\r\nThe penetration of bullets of .314 calibre differs little from that\r\npossessed by the Lee-Metford or Lee-Enfield, of which the muzzle\r\nvelocities are very little lower, with Mark II. bullet. The Belgian\r\nMauser perforates 55 inches of fir-wood at 12 metres distance. With\r\nregard to the penetration of bullets of smaller calibre that of the\r\nRoumanian Mannlicher (.256) may be taken as typical. When fired into a\r\nsand butt at 25 yards the bullet enters 9 inches and then breaks up.\r\n\r\nThe comparative size of the different cartridges is shown in fig. 14.\r\n\r\nThe general remarks already made as to the effect of weight, calibre,\r\nand velocity sufficiently explain the importance of the particulars\r\ngiven in this table, but it will be noted that the Lee-Metford rifle is\r\ninferior to both the Krag-Joergensen and Mauser rifles in the initial\r\nvelocity transmitted to its bullet. The tendency to equalisation, in\r\nthis particular, when the remaining velocity is considered, has been\r\nmentioned; but it may be of interest if I quote from Nimier and Laval[7]\r\nthe scale on which the decrease in velocity takes place in the case of\r\nthe three weapons.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETRES PER SECOND\r\n\r\n+---------------------+-------------+--------+----------------+\r\n|                     | Lee-Metford | Mauser | Krag-Joergensen |\r\n+---------------------+-------------+--------+----------------+\r\n|                     |             |        |                |\r\n| Initial velocity    |     630     |   718  |      720       |\r\n| Remaining velocity: |             |        |                |\r\n| At 100 metres       |     574     |   699  |      718       |\r\n| At 1,000 metres     |     249     |   264  |      269       |\r\n| At 2,000 metres     |     159     |   165  |      165.9     |\r\n|                     |             |        |                |\r\n+---------------------+-------------+--------+----------------+\r\n\r\nGiving full importance to the effects of velocity as a factor in the\r\nseverity of the injuries produced, when the large proportion of wounds\r\nreceived at distances above 1,000 yards is borne in mind, we see how\r\nrapidly the superiority of the smaller projectiles is lost. This loss,\r\neven in the early stages, is probably more than made up for in the case\r\nof the Lee-Metford, when the superiority in weight, calibre, and\r\nbluntness of extremity as contributing to striking force is taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe striking force (kinetic energy) of a bullet is indicated by the\r\nfollowing formula: F = 1/2 mv.^{2}; that is to say, the striking force\r\nis equal to half the weight of the bullet multiplied by the square of\r\nthe velocity.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, with unaltered regulation bullets I was never able to\r\ndetermine any very material difference between the wounds produced,\r\nfurther than that the wounds of entry and exit in the soft parts tended\r\nto correspond with the calibre of the particular bullet concerned.\r\nAlthough the immense majority of the wounds which came under my notice\r\nwere caused by the Mauser bullet, yet I saw some hundreds of wounded\r\nBoers and a good many of our own men wounded by Lee-Metford bullets, in\r\nthe latter case no doubt by some of the sporting varieties. The only\r\ncases that I can call to mind or have noted as exhibiting a superior\r\nwounding power in the Lee-Metford bullet are some injuries to bone. Thus\r\nI saw a considerable number of clean perforations of the patella\r\nproduced by Mauser bullets, while the only two Boers whom I saw with\r\ninjured patellae had suffered transverse fractures. Again, I have a\r\nlively recollection of an old Boer who had suffered a fracture of the\r\nmiddle third of the femur, in the thigh of whom, with small apertures of\r\nentry and exit, a cavity of destroyed tissue, five inches across, was\r\nfound beneath the fascia lata at the distal side of the fracture. I\r\ncannot however say that I did not observe many equally severe injuries\r\nto the femur produced by Mauser bullets in our own men, and as far as\r\nfractures of the skull went, a somewhat crucial test, among the men\r\nbrought off the battlefield alive, I never saw any difference in\r\nseverity whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Sections of four Bullets to show relative shape\r\nand thickness of mantles.\r\n\r\nFrom left to right: 1. Guedes; regular dome-shaped tip; mild steel\r\nmantle; thickness at tip 0.8 mm.; at sides of body 0.3 mm. 2.\r\nLee-Metford; ogival tip; cupro-nickel mantle; thickness at tip 0.8 mm.;\r\ngradual decrease at sides to 0.4 mm. 3. Mauser; pointed dome tip, steel\r\nmantle plated with copper alloy; thickness at tip 0.8 mm.; gradual\r\ndecrease at sides to 0.4 mm. 4. Krag-Joergensen; ogival tip as in\r\nLee-Metford; steel mantle plated with cupro-nickel; thickness at tip 0.6\r\nmm.; gradual decrease at sides to 0.4 mm. The measurements of the sides\r\nare taken 2.5 cm. from the tip. Note the more gradual thinning in the\r\nLee-Metford mantle.]\r\n\r\nThese points of comparison having been made, it only remains to consider\r\none other point, that of the relative stability of the bullets. This is\r\na matter of the greatest importance as regards the regularity or\r\notherwise of the wounding power of the projectile, and, as far as my\r\nexperience went, I believe the Mauser to far exceed the Lee-Metford in\r\ninstability of structure.\r\n\r\nThe core of all four bullets is composed of lead hardened by a certain\r\nadmixture of tin or antimony, but the mantle differs in composition,\r\nthickness both general and in different parts of the bullet, mode of\r\nfixation, and consequently in its power of resistance to violence.\r\n\r\nFig. 15 gives an exact representation of the relative thickness of the\r\nmantles, and shows the general tendency to a thickening of the mantle at\r\nits upper extremity, designed to increase both the stability and\r\nstriking power of the projectile. It will be noted that in general\r\nstoutness the Lee-Metford stands first, as the case increases gradually\r\nin thickness from base to apex.\r\n\r\nBeyond this it must be noted that the Lee-Metford is the only one of the\r\nfour that is ensheathed with a mantle composed of a definite alloy, this\r\nconsisting of 80 parts of nickel and 20 of copper. Two of the remaining\r\nbullets, the Mauser and Krag-Joergensen, are ensheathed with steel\r\ncovered with a thin coating of an alloy of copper or cupro-nickel, to\r\ntake the rifling of the barrel, while the third has a plain steel mantle\r\nwhich is covered with a layer of wax to take the place of the nickel\r\nused in the manufacture of the two others. It is interesting to mention\r\nhere that the Boers evidently found the copper alloy coating\r\ninsufficient for its purpose, or at any rate not satisfactory in\r\npreserving the weapon from the ill-effects consequent on the friction\r\nbetween the steel case and the rifling of the barrel, as at about the\r\nmiddle of the campaign they began to use their bullets waxed, as in the\r\ncase of the Austrian Mannlicher; hence the legend of the poisoned\r\nbullets which caused such a sensation for a short period amongst the\r\nuninitiated. It is possible also that the additional layer of wax was\r\nnecessitated by the wearing of the barrel.\r\n\r\nThe wax employed for the Mauser bullets was not originally green. Mr.\r\nLeslie B. Taylor informs me that it is probably paraffin wax, the green\r\ncolour depending on the formation of verdigris from the copper alloy\r\nwith which the steel envelopes are plated. This completely corresponds\r\nwith my own experience, since on the bullets in my possession the green\r\ncolour, originally pale, has steadily increased in depth. Many old\r\nleaden bullets I found in the Boer arsenals were also waxed, but in this\r\ncase no alteration in colour had taken place. The Guedes bullets, which\r\nare cased in mild steel, become somewhat brown with exposure from a\r\nsimilar oxidation or rusting of the surface.\r\n\r\nAs far as my experience went, however, the steel casing has an important\r\nsurgical bearing beyond the mere question of wear and tear on the rifle\r\nbarrel. That it possesses elasticity and capability of bending is\r\nobvious, and in a later chapter, devoted to irregular wounds, several\r\nillustrations of such deformities are given; but when it strikes stone I\r\nbelieve it splits and tears with very much greater freedom than the\r\ncupro-nickel mantle of the Lee-Metford. At any rate, I never came across\r\nLee-Metford bullets deformed to the same degree as Mauser bullets,\r\neither when removed from the body, or as ricochet projectiles on the\r\nfield of battle. For this reason, therefore, provided the fighting takes\r\nplace on stony ground, I believe the Mauser bullet and others ensheathed\r\nin steel to be much more dangerous surgically than those encased in\r\ncupro-nickel. I fancy this would be equally the case even if the mantles\r\nwere of exactly the same thickness.\r\n\r\nThe layer of copper alloy on the steel mantles is also a physical\r\ncharacteristic worthy of mention. This very readily chips off in a\r\nmanner similar to that we are accustomed to see with nickel-plated\r\ninstruments. This may be due to the compression into the grooving of the\r\nrifle, or as the result of passing impact of the bullet with an obstacle\r\nprevious to entering the body or contact with a bone within it. Small\r\nscales of metal set free in one of these ways are seen in a very large\r\nproportion of Mauser wounds, and although they are so small as usually\r\nto be of little importance, the presence of such in, for instance, the\r\nsubstance of one of the peripheral nerves which has been perforated\r\ncannot be considered a desirable complication.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, it would appear that at mean ranges, both in striking\r\nforce and as regards the area of the tissues affected, the Lee-Metford\r\nis a superior projectile to the Mauser, in spite of the greater initial\r\nvelocity possessed by the latter. On the other hand the comparative ease\r\nwith which the Mauser bullet undergoes deformation either without or\r\nwithin the body, so ensuring more extensive injury and laceration,\r\nrenders it the less desirable bullet to receive a wound from when not in\r\nits normal shape and condition.\r\n\r\nI can say little about the remaining two rifles. The Krag-Joergensen was\r\nlittle used, and beyond pointing out its capacity to inflict very neat\r\nindividual injuries, in which it must surpass even the Mauser, I can\r\nonly add that I had no opportunity of forming an opinion as to the\r\ndanger dependent on the great initial velocity imparted to the bullet.\r\nThe Guedes rifle has been included in the table because it approximates\r\nin bore to the other three. Its bullet is of the same calibre as the\r\nAustrian Mannlicher, one of the most powerful military rifles in use,\r\nand it was used to a considerable extent during the war by the Boers.[8]\r\nAs to its capabilities, it appeared an inferior weapon, since want of\r\nvelocity and striking power of the bullets was indicated by the number\r\nof these which were retained in the body, and by the fact that I never\r\nsaw one extracted that had undergone any more serious deformation than\r\nsome flattening on one side of the tip. On the other hand wounds of the\r\nsoft parts occasioned by it were only to be distinguished from Mauser\r\nwounds by their slightly greater size, and at a short range of fire the\r\nweight and volume of the bullet made it a dangerous projectile.\r\n\r\nThe question of deformed bullets will be again referred to at length in\r\nthe section on wounds of irregular type, and a number of type specimens\r\nare there figured and described (p. 76). In the same chapter will be\r\nfound illustrations of a number of sporting bullets of small calibre, as\r\nwell as of large calibres in lead, found in the Boer arsenals and camps.\r\nI have placed them in that position as mainly of interest in connection\r\nwith the occurrence of large and irregular wounds (see figs. 42 and 43,\r\npp. 95 and 98).\r\n\r\nThe small sporting bullets were mostly of the Mauser (.276), Lee-Metford\r\n(.303), or Mannlicher (.315) calibre.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] See tables, pp. 12, 13, 15, Chapter I.\r\n\r\n[6] The weights are from cartridges brought home. The charge of powder\r\nwas small and variable.\r\n\r\n[7] H. Nimier and E. Laval, _Les Projectiles des Armes de Guerre_, p.\r\n20. F. Alcan. 1899.\r\n\r\n[8] Mr. Leslie B. Taylor informs me that this rifle is a discarded\r\nPortuguese regulation pattern, with which a copper-ensheathed soft-nosed\r\nbullet was originally employed. For the purposes of the present campaign\r\na modified cartridge was constructed. Examination of some specimens in\r\nmy possession showed the charge of powder to be very small. (Table I. p.\r\n48.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGENERAL CHARACTERS OF WOUNDS PRODUCED BY BULLETS OF SMALL CALIBRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effects of injuries inflicted by bullets of small calibre may be\r\ndivided into two classes:\r\n\r\n1. Direct or immediate destruction of tissue.\r\n\r\n2. Remote changes induced by the transmission of vibratory force from\r\nthe passing projectile to neighbouring tissues or organs.\r\n\r\nThose of the first class will be mainly considered in this chapter; the\r\nremote effects will be dealt with under the headings devoted to special\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the wounds as a whole I shall first describe those of\r\nuncomplicated character as type injuries, and deal with those possessing\r\nspecial or irregular characters separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPE WOUNDS\r\n\r\n1. _Nature of the external apertures._--The apertures of entry and exit\r\nin uncomplicated cases are very insignificant, but the size naturally\r\nvaries slightly with that of the special form of bullet concerned. As\r\nwill be shown moreover, the difference in size is the only real\r\ndistinguishing characteristic in many cases between wounds produced by\r\nthe modern bullet of small calibre and those resulting from the use of\r\nthe older and larger projectiles of conical form. I have been very much\r\nstruck on looking over my diagrams of entry, and especially exit, wounds\r\nto find that they reproduce in miniature most of those figured in the\r\nHistory of the War of the Rebellion; some of these diagrams are\r\nreproduced in this chapter.\r\n\r\n_Aperture of entry._--The typical wound of entry with a normal\r\nundeformed bullet varies in appearance according to whether the\r\nprojectile has impinged at a right angle or at increasing degrees of\r\nobliquity, or again, to whether the skin is supported by soft tissues\r\nalone, or on those of a more resistent nature such as bone or cartilage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Mauser Entry and Exit Wounds. A, entry in\r\nbuttock; circular opening filled with clot and crossed by a tag of\r\ntissue. B, exit in epigastrium near mid-line; irregular slit form, with\r\nwell-marked prominence. Specimens hardened in formalin immediately after\r\ndeath; the resulting contraction has slightly exaggerated the\r\nirregularity of outline of the entry wound]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Gutter Wound of outer aspect of shoulder,\r\ncaused by a normal Mauser, which subsequently perforated a man's leg. At\r\nthe central part the gutter was 3/4 in. deep a few days after the\r\ninjury]\r\n\r\nWhen the bullet impinges at a right angle the wound is circular, with\r\nmore or less depressed margins, and of a diameter, corresponding to the\r\nsize of the bullet occasioning it, from a quarter to a third of an inch.\r\nThe description 'punched out' has been sometimes applied to it, but it\r\nwould be more correct to reverse the term to 'punched in,' since the\r\nappearance is really most nearly simulated by a hole resulting from the\r\ndriving of a solid punch into a soft structure enveloped in a denser\r\ncovering. The loss of substance, moreover, in the primary stage is not\r\nactually so great as appears to be the case, fragments of contused\r\ntissue from the margin being turned into the opening of the wound track.\r\nThe true margin therefore is not sharp cut, and the nature of the line\r\ndiffers somewhat according to the structure of the skin in the locality\r\nimpinged upon. Thus the granular scalp and the comparatively homogeneous\r\nskin of the anterior abdominal wall will furnish good examples of the\r\nnature of the slight difference in appearance. From the first the margin\r\nis also often somewhat discoloured by a metallic stain, similar to that\r\nseen when a bullet is fired through a paper book. This ring is, however,\r\nnarrow, and not likely to be noticeable when the bullet has passed\r\nthrough the clothing. In any case it is subsequently obscured by the\r\ndevelopment of a narrow ring of discoloration due to the contusion. This\r\nlatter varies in width, and still later a halo of ecchymosis half an\r\ninch or more in diameter surrounds the original wound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Oblique Exit Gutter. Diagram enlarged to actual\r\nsize from case shown in fig. 24, p. 64.]\r\n\r\nWith increasing degrees of obliquity of impact more and more pronounced\r\noval openings of entry result, culminating in an actual gutter such as\r\nis seen in fig. 17.\r\n\r\nIn all oval openings the loss of substance is more pronounced at the\r\nproximal margin, while the wound is liable to undergo secondary\r\nenlargement at the distal margin, since in the former the epidermis is\r\nmainly affected, while in the latter the epidermis is spared as an\r\nill-nourished bridge, the deeper layers of the skin suffering the more\r\nseverely. When the wound occurs in regions, such as the chest-wall or\r\nover the sacrum, where the skin is firmly supported, the oval openings\r\nare often very considerable in size, reaching a diameter at least double\r\nthat of the circular ones. In the case of the oval openings the\r\ndepression of the margins is not such a well-marked feature as in wounds\r\nresulting from rectangular impact of the bullet, since the distal margin\r\nis really lifted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Oval Entry Wound over third sacral vertebra.\r\nExit wound, anterior abdominal wall. Slightly starred variety. Diagram\r\nmade on second day]\r\n\r\n_Aperture of exit._--The wound of exit in normal cases offers far more\r\nvariation in appearance than that of entry, this variation depending on\r\nseveral circumstances: first, the want of support to the skin from\r\nwithout, and such other factors as the degree of velocity retained by\r\nthe travelling bullet, the locality of the opening, and the density,\r\ntension, and resistance offered by the particular area of skin\r\nimplicated.\r\n\r\nWhen the range has been short and the velocity high, it is often\r\ndifficult to discriminate between the two apertures. Both may be\r\ncircular and of approximately the same size, and the only distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic, the slight depression of the margin of the wound of\r\nentrance, may be absent if any time has elapsed between the infliction\r\nof the injury and examination by the surgeon. One very strong\r\ncharacteristic if present is the general tendency of the margins, and\r\neven the area surrounding the exit wound itself, to be somewhat\r\nprominent. Fig. 16 shows this point, although the wound from which it\r\nwas drawn had been produced thirty-six hours before death. The specimen\r\nwas then hardened in formalin and still preserves its original aspect.\r\nThis character is, however, more frequently displayed in wounds received\r\nat mean, or longer, ranges. In wounds produced by bullets travelling at\r\nthe highest degrees of velocity it is often absent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Circular Entry back of arm; exit (bird-like) in\r\nanterior elbow crease]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Circular Entry over patella. Starred exit of\r\nelongated form in popliteal crease]\r\n\r\nWhen the range of fire has been greater and the velocity retained by the\r\nbullet lower, slit wounds are common, or some of the slighter degrees of\r\nstarring. Actual starring I never saw, but reference to figs. 20 and 21\r\nwill show a tendency in this direction, also a close resemblance to the\r\nstarred wounds resulting from perforations by large leaden bullets.\r\nSuch wounds, I believe, are usually the result of a somewhat low degree\r\nof velocity.\r\n\r\nSlit exit wounds may be vertical or transverse (fig. 20) in direction,\r\nand the production of these is dependent on the locality in which they\r\nare situated, the thickness, density, and tension of the skin, and the\r\nnature of the connection of the latter with the subcutaneous fascia in\r\nthe locality. Thus in wounds of different parts of the hairy scalp, so\r\nlittle variation exists in the relative density and structure of the\r\nskin, that, in spite of the want of external support at the aperture of\r\nexit, it is often difficult to discriminate offhand the two apertures,\r\nif neither bone nor brain debris occupies that of exit.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a wound crosses from side to side a region such as the\r\nthigh where well-marked differences exist in the subjacent support,\r\nthickness, and elasticity of the skin implicated in the apertures, the\r\nwound of entry, if in the thick skin of the outer aspect, was usually\r\ncircular, while the exit in the thin elastic skin of the inner aspect\r\nwas either slit-like or starred. The difficulty in laying down any\r\ngeneral rule as to the occurrence of circular or slit apertures of exit\r\nin any definite region is, however, great, as may be seen by reference\r\nto the accompanying diagrams taken from two patients wounded at\r\nPaardeberg (figs. 22 and 23).\r\n\r\nIn fig. 22 the bullet entered the outer and posterior aspect of the left\r\nbuttock, crossed the limb behind the femur, and emerged at the inner\r\naspect by a vertical slit: the bullet then entered the scrotum by a\r\nvertical slit, and emerged by a typical circular aperture; re-entered\r\nthe right thigh by a transverse slit aperture, and, striking the femur\r\nin its further course, underwent deformation, and finally escaped by an\r\nirregular aperture 3/4 of an inch in diameter. The occurrence of exit\r\nslits in the adductor region is common, and to be explained by the\r\ntendency of the comparatively thin elastic skin to be carried before the\r\nbullet; the slit entry in this position must, I suppose, be explained by\r\nthe comparatively slight support afforded by the underlying structures,\r\nwhich are often in a condition of hollow tension. The scrotal wounds are\r\nperhaps more difficult to account for, but in this case the fact of the\r\ndistal aperture being directly supported by the right thigh is a ready\r\nexplanation of the circular exit, while the skin corresponding to the\r\nslit entry was no doubt carried before the bullet, and finally gave way\r\nin the line of a normal crease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Entry and Exit Wounds in both thighs and\r\nscrotum. From right to left: 1. Circular entry in left buttock behind\r\ntrochanter. 2. Vertical slit exit in adductor region. 3. Slit entry in\r\nscrotum (probably inverted before bullet broke the surface, and then a\r\nslit occurred in a normal crease). 4. Circular exit in scrotum (here\r\nsupported by surface of right thigh). 5. Transverse slit entry in right\r\nadductor region. 6. Irregular 'explosive' exit, the bullet having set up\r\non contact with the front surface of the femur, but without having\r\ncaused solution of continuity of the bone.]\r\n\r\nIn fig. 23 all the wounds are circular except the final exit, which was\r\nirregular as a result of the bullet in this case also having struck the\r\nfemur in the second thigh. Considerable variation also exists in the\r\nsize of the circular apertures; this illustrates the secondary\r\nenlargement often occurring in such wounds, and most marked at the\r\napertures of entry, as the more contused. Both diagrams were made from\r\npatients eight days after the reception of the wounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Wound of both Thighs. First and second entry\r\ntypical circular wounds. First exit a small circular wound; the bullet\r\n'set up' on contact with the femur without causing solution of\r\ncontinuity of the bone, and second exit is irregular and large.\r\n\r\nThis diagram is of considerable interest when compared with fig. 22. I\r\nbelieve the comparative regularity in the wounds to have been due to a\r\nhigher degree of velocity of flight on the part of the bullet]\r\n\r\nLastly, vertical or transverse slits may be looked for with considerable\r\nconfidence in situations in which transverse oblique or vertical folds\r\nor creases normally exist in the skin, and depend on the lines of\r\ntension maintained by the connection of the skin in these situations to\r\nthe underlying fascia. Thus I saw well-marked transverse and vertical\r\nslits in the forehead corresponding with the creases normally found\r\nthere, and in this situation I noted some slit entries. Transverse\r\nslits were common in the folds of the neck, the flexures of the joints\r\n(fig. 20), and the anterior abdominal wall either in the mid line or in\r\ncreases like those stretching across from the anterior superior iliac\r\nspines. Again they were seen in the palms and soles, but here more\r\nreadily tended to assume the stellate forms. Vertical slits are less\r\ncommon; they occurred with the greatest frequency in the posterior\r\naxillary folds.\r\n\r\nOval apertures of exit are far less common than those of entry, since\r\nthe most common factor for the production of an oval opening, bony\r\nsupport, is never present. In long subcutaneous tracks, or very\r\nsuperficial wounds, they are however sometimes met with and may\r\nterminate in a pointed gutter (see figs. 18 and 24).\r\n\r\nThe greatest modifications in the appearance and nature of the apertures\r\nof entry are dependent on previous deformation of the bullet, when all\r\nspecial characteristics are lost, and it becomes impossible to form any\r\nopinion as to the type of bullet concerned. These modifications are\r\nnaturally far more common in the aperture of exit, since the bullet so\r\noften acquires deformity in the body as the result of impact with the\r\nbones. Further remarks on this subject will be found with the\r\ndescription and comparison of the various bullets on p. 81.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. Superficial Thoracico-abdominal Track. Small\r\nentry: discoloration of surface over costal margin from deep injury to\r\nskin; well-marked 'flame' gutter exit (see fig. 18)]\r\n\r\n2. _Direct course taken by the wound track._--This character primarily\r\ndepends on the velocity with which bullets of small calibre are made to\r\ntravel, and on the small area of the tissues upon which they operate. In\r\nthis relation the degree of velocity retained by the bullet is often of\r\nminor importance, provided it be sufficient to penetrate the body. Fired\r\nwithin a distance of 2,500 yards there is little doubt that a bullet of\r\nthe Lee-Metford, Mauser, or Krag-Joergensen types, passes straight\r\nbetween the apertures of entry and exit when these are of the type\r\noutline, even when the bones are implicated. By reason of the small size\r\nof the projectiles, their shape, and the spin and velocity transmitted\r\nto them, there is no reason why at a sufficiently short range they\r\nshould not traverse the body from the crown of the head to the sole of\r\nthe foot. The necessary conditions of position and distance for such an\r\ninjury are obviously not often obtained, but it may be pointed out that\r\nthe Belgian Mauser rifle at a distance of five yards is capable of\r\ndriving a bullet 55 inches or nearly five feet into a log of pine-wood.\r\nMany examples of long tracks will be referred to later, but the\r\nfollowing instances may be of interest in this relation. A bullet\r\nentering at the occipital protuberance traversed the muscles of the\r\nneck, passed through the thoracic cavity, fractured the bodies of the\r\nthird and fourth and grooved the seventh and eighth dorsal vertebrae,\r\ngrooved the seventh and eighth and fractured the ninth and tenth ribs,\r\ntraversed the muscles of the back and finally lodged against the ilium;\r\nthe whole length of this track measured some 25 inches. Again, at the\r\nbattle of Belmont a Mauser bullet entered the pelvis of a horse just\r\nbelow the anus, and traversed the entire trunk before emerging from the\r\nfront of the chest: it may be of interest to mention that this animal\r\nwas alive and moving about the next day, but I am sorry I can give no\r\nfurther information regarding his fate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Superficial Track on external surface of Thigh.\r\nLocal discoloration of skin five weeks after reception of injury]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of contour tracks travelling around the walls of the\r\nchest or abdomen has therefore rarely to be considered, except in\r\noccasional instances where the bullet fired from a long range has\r\nimpinged against a bone and is retained in the body. The small volume of\r\nthe bullets, however, allows the production of very prolonged direct\r\nsubcutaneous tracks in the body wall, in positions where they would be\r\nmanifestly impossible with projectiles of larger calibre.\r\n\r\nFigs. 24 and 25 illustrate wounds of this nature. In the case figured in\r\nfig. 24 the bullet entered over the third rib in a vertical line above\r\nthe right nipple; it then coursed obliquely down, crossing the seventh\r\ncostal cartilage, and finally emerged 3 inches above the umbilicus.\r\nWhere the track crossed the prominence of the thoracic margin the skin\r\nwas so thinned as to undergo subsequent discoloration, while a distinct\r\ngroove was evident there on palpation. In some similar cases I have seen\r\nthe central part of the track secondarily laid open as a result of the\r\nthinning of the skin and consequent sloughing due to the interference\r\nwith its vitality.\r\n\r\nShort of sloughing, the skin may show signs of alteration of vitality\r\nfor a long period after the injury; thus fig. 25 depicts the condition\r\nseen in a superficial wound of the thigh five weeks after the injury.\r\nThe line of passage of the bullet between the two openings was still\r\nclearly visible as a dark red coloured streak. Grooves in such cases are\r\ngenerally readily palpable in the early stages, while later the want of\r\nresistance is replaced by the readily felt firm cord representing the\r\ncicatrix. These points are of much importance in discriminating between\r\nperforating and non-perforating wounds of the abdomen, and are again\r\nreferred to in that connection.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the tracks obviously depends on the attitude assumed by\r\nthe patient at the moment of impact of the bullet and the direction\r\nwhence the firing has proceeded. The frequent assumption of the prone\r\nposition during the campaign led to the occurrence of a large proportion\r\nof longitudinal tracks in the trunk, or trunk and head, which will be\r\nreferred to later. Certain battles were in fact strongly characterised\r\nby the nature of the wounds sustained by the men. Thus at Belmont and\r\nGraspan, where some rapid advances were made in the erect attitude,\r\nfractured thighs were proportionately numerous, while at Modder River,\r\nwhere many of the men lay for a great part of the day in the prone\r\nposition, glancing wounds of the uplifted head, of the occipital region,\r\nor longitudinal tracks in the trunk and limbs were particularly\r\nfrequent. I very much regret that the material at my disposal does not\r\nallow me to add some remarks as to variation in the nature of the\r\nwounds according to whether they were received from an enemy firing from\r\na height or from below, but it is possible that some information on this\r\nsubject may be forthcoming when the returns of the Service are made up,\r\nsince it is naturally of great importance as to the effect of trajectory\r\nin the proportionate occurrence of hits.\r\n\r\n3. _Multiple character of the wounds._--The same conditions responsible\r\nfor the length and directness of the tracks, account for the frequently\r\nmultiple character of the wounds implicating either the limbs or\r\nviscera--thus, lung, stomach, liver; neck, thorax, abdomen; abdomen,\r\npelvis, thigh. Also for the frequent infliction of two or more separate\r\ntracks by the same bullet--thus, arm and forearm with the elbow in the\r\nflexed position; both lower extremities; both lower extremities, penis\r\nor scrotum; leg, thigh, and abdomen, with a flexed knee; upper extremity\r\nand trunk, and more rarely one upper and one lower extremity. Again, it\r\nwas remarkable how often the same bullet would inflict injuries on two\r\nor more separate men, not unfrequently dealing lightly with the first\r\nand inflicting a fatal injury on the second, or vice versa. The small\r\ncalibre of the bullet, moreover, allows of the neatest and most exact\r\nmultiple injuries. Thus in a patient who was crawling up a kopje on all\r\nfours, the flexed middle digit of the hand was struck. The bullet\r\nentered at the base of the nail, first emerged at the distal\r\ninterphalangeal flexor fold, re-entered the metacarpo-phalangeal fold,\r\nand finally emerged from the back of the hand between the third and\r\nfourth metacarpal bones.\r\n\r\n4. _Small 'bore' of the tracks, and tendency of the injury to be\r\nlocalised to individual structures of importance._--Here we meet with\r\nthe most striking characteristic of the injuries, and evidence that\r\nreduction of calibre affects more strongly the nature of the lesion than\r\ndoes any other element in the structure of the modern rifle. The\r\ndiameter of the track slightly exceeds that of the external apertures,\r\nprobably as a result of the more ready separability of the elements of\r\nthe structures perforated than exists in the skin. The calibre,\r\nmoreover, tends to be fairly even throughout when soft structures only\r\nare implicated, though local enlargements result wherever increased\r\nresistance is met with. Thus a strong fascia may offer such resistance\r\nas to increase locally the bore of the track, and in this particular the\r\nstate of tension of the fascia when struck will affect the degree of the\r\nenlargement. The most striking instances of local enlargement of the\r\ntrack are of course seen when a bone lies in the course of the bullet,\r\nbut we must here bear in mind the introduction of a new element--the\r\npropulsion of comminuted fragments together with the bullet itself. In\r\ncases of fracture the distal portion of the track is in consequence many\r\ntimes larger than the proximal. The most striking examples of small even\r\ntracks are seen, on the other hand, in punctures of the elastic and\r\npractically homogeneous lung tissue, where the wounds are extremely\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nOn transverse section of the track the gross amount of actual tissue\r\ndestruction occupies a lesser area than that corresponding to the\r\ndiameter of the bullet. The destructive action of the projectile is in\r\nfact exerted mainly on the tissues directly lying in its course, the\r\ntrack being opened up during the rush of the passage of the bullet,\r\npartly as a result of its wedge-like shape and partly as a result of the\r\nthrowing off of the tissues forming the walls of the track by a\r\ndiversion of a portion of the force in the form of spiral vibrations\r\ndependent on the revolution of the bullet. Again, the opening out of the\r\ntissues may be aided by the direction taken by the first and strongest\r\nas well as the simplest series of vibrations transmitted, which would\r\nassume the shape of a cone of which the point of impact forms the apex.\r\n\r\nThe escape from actual destruction by structures lying in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the track is indeed often surprising, but not perhaps\r\nso astonishing as the perforation of long narrow structures such as the\r\nperipheral nerves and vessels, without irreparable damage to the parts\r\nremaining, and this although the structures themselves may be of a\r\ndiameter not exceeding that of the bullet itself. The capacity of these\r\nprojectiles to split such structures as tendons was already well known\r\nbefore our experience in this campaign, but the injuries to the nerves\r\nand vessels of the same character came as a surprise to most of us. The\r\nlateral displacement of tissues seems to bear a strong resemblance to\r\nwhat is seen on the passage of an express train, when solid bodies of\r\nconsiderable weight are displaced by the draught created without ever\r\ncoming into contact with the train itself. The tendency to lateral\r\ndisplacement is still more strongly exhibited when dense hard structures\r\nsuch as bone are implicated. Here the fragments at the actual points of\r\nimpact on the proximal and distal surfaces of a shaft are driven\r\nforwards, while the lateral walls of the track in the bone are simply\r\ncomminuted and pushed on one side without loss of continuity with their\r\ncovering periosteum.\r\n\r\nThe extension of this form of displacement to a degree amounting to a\r\nso-called explosive character in the case of the soft tissues, even when\r\nthe bullet passed at the highest degrees of velocity, was, however,\r\nnever witnessed by me, and I very much doubt the existence of a\r\nso-called 'explosive zone' so far as wounds of the soft parts are\r\nconcerned. On the contrary, I am inclined to believe that the highest\r\ndegrees of velocity are favourable to clean-cut neat injuries of the\r\nsoft tissues. I saw a large number of type wounds of entry and exit\r\ninflicted at a range of under fifty yards.\r\n\r\n5. _Clinical course of the wounds._--The tendency of simple wounds such\r\nas are above described to run an aseptic course was very marked, and,\r\ngiven satisfactory conditions, deep suppuration and cellulitis were\r\ndistinctly rare. It may also be confidently affirmed that when\r\nsuppuration did occur, with apertures of entry and exit of the normal\r\nsmall type, this was always the result of infection from the skin, or\r\ninfection subsequent to the actual infliction of the wound. The\r\ninfrequency of suppuration depended on the aseptic nature of the injury,\r\nthe smallness of the openings, the small tendency of the track to weep\r\nand furnish serous discharge in any abundance, the comparative rarity of\r\nthe inclusion of fragments of clothing or other foreign bodies, and\r\npossibly in some degree on the purity and dryness of the atmosphere,\r\nwhich favoured a firm dry clotting of the blood in the apertures of\r\nentry and exit, and consequent safe 'sealing of the wound.'\r\n\r\nAs to the aseptic nature of the injury, it will be well to first\r\nconsider the question of the sterility of the bullet. Putting laboratory\r\nexperiments on one side, the large experience of this campaign seems to\r\nprove to absolute demonstration that, bearing in mind the very large\r\nproportion of instances of primary union in simple tracks, the surgeon\r\nhas nothing to fear on the part of the bullet itself. This is the more\r\nstriking when we remember that these bullets shortly before their\r\nemployment were carried in a dirty bandolier, and freely handled by men\r\nwhose opportunities of rendering either their hands or implements\r\naseptic were as bad as it is possible to conceive.\r\n\r\nSeveral explanations are to hand, but none of them conclusive. Two must,\r\nhowever, be shortly considered. First, the surface of the bullet, except\r\nits tip and base, is practically renewed by passage through the barrel.\r\nSecondly, there is the question of the heat to which it is subjected. As\r\nfar as cauterisation of the tissues is concerned, this question has been\r\npractically settled in the negative, since actual determinations of the\r\nheat immediately after the moment of impact have been made, and again it\r\nhas been shown that butter is not melted, and that neither gunpowder nor\r\ndynamite is exploded, by firing bullets through small quantities of\r\nthose materials. Again, the absence of any sign of scorching of the\r\nclothes of the wounded is strong evidence against the possibility of any\r\nconsiderable heat being applied to the tissues of the body; while\r\nanother observation, although of less importance as affecting spent\r\nbullets only, that bullets, which have perforated the body but lie\r\nbetween the skin and the clothing, leave no sign of cauterising action\r\non either, may be mentioned. None the less, the sources of heating while\r\nthe bullet is passing from the barrel are many and obvious. Thus there\r\nis the heat consequent on explosion of the powder, the warm state of the\r\nbarrel itself when the rifle has been fired a few times consecutively,\r\nand the heat resulting from the force and friction essential to the\r\npropulsion of the bullet through the barrel. Again, bullets covered with\r\nwax before their introduction into the barrel retain no trace of this\r\nwhen they have been fired, although at any rate the portion covering\r\nthe tip is not exposed to friction on the part of the rifle, and lastly\r\nthe base of the bullet has no other explicable reason for its\r\ninnocuousness than subjection to a certain degree of heat. While not\r\nclaiming any cauterising action on the tissues by the bullet, I should\r\ntherefore still be inclined to allow the probability of the heat to\r\nwhich the surface of the bullet is exposed exerting a cleansing action\r\non the projectile. In regard to this point it is interesting to bear in\r\nmind that shots from an ordinary gun seldom or never give rise to\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nForeign bodies were rarely carried into the wounds with the bullet. I\r\nsaw several instances in which portions of the metal of cigarette cases\r\nand of cartridge cases when the bullet had perforated cartridges in the\r\nwounded man's bandolier, and in one instance small pieces of glass from\r\na pocket mirror, must have been carried in without any obvious ill\r\neffect. Fragments of clothing, on the other hand, in every case caused\r\nsuppuration: clothing was not often carried in, the khaki linen was\r\nperforated with a clean aperture, most commonly a slit; but the thick\r\nwoollen kilts of the Highlanders, and thick flannel shirts, occasionally\r\nfurnished fragments. The introduction of large pieces of clothing is a\r\nsure proof of irregularity of impact on the part of the bullet. The\r\nfrequency with which portions of cloth were introduced from the kilt was\r\none of the strongest surgical objections to its retention as a part of\r\nthe uniform on active service.\r\n\r\nRetained bullets themselves remained as foreign bodies in a certain\r\nnumber of cases. I cannot say that suppuration never followed the\r\nretention of a bullet, since in two of the instances where I saw such\r\nremoved they lay in a small cavity containing at any rate a 'purulent\r\nfluid.' In one of these the bullet was a Martini-Henry, and in both the\r\nbullet had been imbedded for some weeks, and had certainly not\r\noccasioned a primary suppuration of the wound.\r\n\r\nThe favourable influence of the pure and dry nature of the atmosphere in\r\nthis campaign must certainly not be underrated, and in support of this\r\ninfluence I think I may say, from the experience of cases that I saw\r\ncoming from Natal where the climate and surroundings were not so\r\nfavourable as on the western side, that suppuration was more common and\r\nmore severe in the moister atmosphere.\r\n\r\nPutting aside all the above remarks, however, I am inclined to think\r\nthat a general tendency to primary union and the absence of suppuration\r\nwill always be a feature of wounds from bullets of small calibre, and\r\nthat this favourable tendency is attributable to certain inherent\r\ncharacters of the injuries. Of these the nature and small size of the\r\nopenings, the dry character of the lining of the track due to\r\nsuperficial destruction and condensation of the tissue forming its wall,\r\nthe small disposition to prolonged primary haemorrhage, and the absence\r\nof any great amount of serous exudation during the early stages of\r\nhealing are the most important.\r\n\r\nA mechanical factor of great importance also exists in the spontaneous\r\ncollapse and automatic apposition of the walls of the track. This\r\nclosure is rendered additionally effective in many cases by the\r\ninterruption of the continuous line in the wounded tissues consequent on\r\nalteration in the position of the parts traversed when an attitude of\r\nrest is assumed by the injured part. The indisposition to suppuration\r\nand the apparent unsuitability of the tissue lining the track for the\r\ndevelopment and spread of infecting organisms are well illustrated by\r\nseveral observations. Thus, even if the bullet be thoroughly aseptic,\r\nthe fragments of destroyed skin driven into the track by the bullet can\r\nscarcely be free from organisms; yet these seldom give rise to trouble.\r\nAgain, if for any reason a deep portion of a track becomes infected and\r\nsuppurates, there is no tendency for the spread of infection along the\r\nline of wounded tissue, but rather for the development of a local\r\nabscess, pointing in the ordinary direction of least resistance,\r\nirrespective of the course originally taken by the bullet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\nG.

The specimen was removed by Mr. Cheatle from\r\na patient who died forty-eight hours after reception of the injury. It\r\nshows well the small amount of gross destruction suffered by the\r\nsubcutaneous tissue, and the rapid repair which follows, since\r\nmacroscopically the track is scarcely discernible. Reference to plate I.\r\nshows the remarkable fact that even at this early date considerable\r\nprogress towards definite healing has occurred, and a thin layer of\r\nstratified epidermis covers the original opening. The question may be\r\nraised whether the origin of this epidermal layer is not in part a\r\nfloating up of the margins of the main aperture.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of healing some variation takes place in the\r\nappearance of the apertures, especially that of entry. This, at first\r\ncontracted, later becomes somewhat relaxed, while in many cases a small\r\nhalo of ecchymosis develops around it. The blood-clot occupying its\r\ncentre now contracts, the margins rapidly become approximated\r\ncentripetally, and a small circular dark spot only remains, which is\r\nlater replaced by a small red cicatrix. The dark central spot under\r\nthese circumstances consists of the contused margin of the wound in the\r\nskin, and a small proportion of blood-clot which finally comes away as a\r\nsmall dry scab. When slight local infection occurs in place of simple\r\ncontraction and dry scabbing, the process is prolonged, the contused\r\nmargin separates by granulation, the clot in the opening breaks down,\r\nand a small ulcer of somewhat larger proportions than the original wound\r\nremains and takes some days to heal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25 (_a_).--_A._ Wound of entry 48 hours after\r\nreception. _B._ Wound of exit, 7-1/2 days after reception. 1.

(See\r\nplates I. and II.)]\r\n\r\nThe aperture of exit in simple wounds of the soft parts sometimes heals\r\neven more rapidly than that of entry, and if of the slit form may be\r\nalmost invisible at the end of ten days or a fortnight, actual primary\r\nunion having taken place as after a simple small incision. Larger or\r\nirregular exit apertures, however, take a longer period to close than\r\nentry wounds, and this is most often observed when the bullet has\r\nundergone deformation within the body, or bone fragments have been\r\ndriven out with the bullet.\r\n\r\nFig. 25 (_a_), B (plate II.) represents a section of an infected exit\r\naperture from a patient who died seven and a half days after its\r\ninfliction. Two main points of interest are at once apparent: 1. The\r\ncarrying forwards of the subcutaneous fat into the lips of the skin\r\nwound by the bullet. This illustrates the manner in which lightly\r\nsupported structures are carried forward by the bullet, and throws some\r\nlight on the mode by which vessels and nerves may escape by a process of\r\ndisplacement. This figure may be compared with fig. 25 (_b_) which shows\r\na tag of omentum similarly carried forward by a bullet crossing the\r\nabdominal cavity and plugging the exit wound. 2. The second feature of\r\ninterest is the amount of haemorrhage into the subcutaneous tissue. In\r\nthis respect the contrast between the exit and entry apertures is\r\nmarked, since in the latter haemorrhage is scarcely apparent. The\r\npresence of such haemorrhages is explained by the same dragging action as\r\nthe extrusion of the fat, and is of course dependent on consequent\r\nrupture of small vessels. It is of importance as predisposing the exit\r\nwound to more easy infection, and it accounts for the persisting\r\nsubcutaneous induration more often detected beneath healed exit than\r\nentry apertures. Again, it suggests that the presence of blood in the\r\ndeeper parts of the tracks may be the determining cause of the indurated\r\ncords often replacing them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\nG.

A small wedge-shaped plug\r\nof lymph indicates the position of the actual track at its termination.\r\n\r\nDragging on the surrounding tissue consequent on the extrusion of the\r\nplug of fat has ruptured some capillaries, and given rise to\r\nconsiderable extravasation of blood, which is seen as a darker layer in\r\nthe deepest portion of the wound.\r\n\r\nComparison of this plate with the exit wound depicted in fig. 16, p. 56,\r\nexplains the nature of the tags of tissue there seen to protrude from\r\nthe convex opening.\r\n\r\nRange 800 yards. Seat of wound, abdominal wall below 9th costal\r\ncartilage.]\r\n\r\n_Pari passu_ with the closure of the external openings, healing of the\r\ntrack takes place, but this is not always so rapid a process as is\r\napparently the case. In many instances the closure, and even definite\r\nhealing, of the external wounds is complete long before the track has\r\nactually healed, even though it be contracted up to complete closure as\r\nfar as any cavity is concerned. This is well seen in many cases in which\r\nthe exit opening is large as a result of deformation of the bullet, or\r\nthe passage of bone splinters in conjunction with it; here, in spite of\r\nabsence of all suppuration, the track may remain patent for many weeks.\r\nThis may point to infection, but the tardiness in actual consolidation\r\ncorresponds with what we are well acquainted with in the case of all\r\naseptic wounds when a slough has to separate or become absorbed, and it\r\nis therefore only what might be reasonably expected when we remember\r\nthat every such bullet track is lined by a thin layer of damaged tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25 (_b_).--Great Omentum carried by the bullet into\r\nan exit track leading from the abdominal cavity. A. Outline of opening\r\nin the peritoneum]\r\n\r\nWhen fully healed, the points of entry and exit are so insignificant as\r\nto be less obvious than ordinary acne scars, and later are often hardly\r\nvisible, but for a considerable period they are often more palpable than\r\napparent. This depends upon the induration of the line of cicatrix\r\ncorresponding to the course of the original track which is adherent to\r\nthe two points. The induration is indeed so marked as to occasionally\r\ngive rise to the suspicion that a foreign body such as a fragment of\r\nlead or of the mantle of the bullet has been enclosed during the healing\r\nof the wound.\r\n\r\nIn the deeper portions of the tracks the extreme density of the cicatrix\r\nis a factor of great prognostic importance, since if it implicates\r\nmuscles, tendons, vessels, or nerves, impairment of movement,\r\ncirculatory disturbance, or signs of neuritis or nerve pressure are\r\noften witnessed. Thus, for instance, a track traversing the calf, will\r\nmore or less tie the whole thickness of the structures perforated at one\r\nspot, and the apertures of entry and exit may be visibly retracted when\r\nthe muscles are put in action with consequent pain and stiffness to the\r\npatient. Such pain and stiffness form some of the most troublesome\r\nafter-consequences of many simple wounds. It is remarkable for how long\r\na period after the healing of the wound and resumption of active duty\r\nthe patients suffer from pain in and radiating from the locality of the\r\nwound, when fatigued or suffering from stiffness from the prolonged\r\nretention of one attitude or exposure to cold. The cords, however,\r\neventually completely disappear, and the cicatrices become moveable. The\r\neffects of secondary pressure on the vessels and nerves are considered\r\nunder the headings devoted to those structures.\r\n\r\n_Suppuration._--While the occurrence of deep suppuration or septic\r\nphlegmon was rare, local suppuration of the apertures of entry and exit\r\nwas seen in a considerable proportion of the wounds. This was referable\r\nto infection from the skin itself, or to infection from without\r\nsubsequent to the infliction of the injury. Infection from the skin,\r\ndifficult to obviate at all times, is especially likely to occur in\r\nwounds the first dressing of which is often delayed, and which happen to\r\nmen sweating freely into clothes the condition of which is at least\r\nundesirable for contact with a recent wound. Beyond this, the first\r\ndressing materials, removed from a soiled tunic by possibly a comrade or\r\na stretcher-bearer, are scarcely above reproach of the probability of\r\ncontaining septic organisms themselves. Again, once applied, the\r\nexigencies of the situation often necessitate an amount of movement\r\nfatal to the retention of the dressing over the wound, and a second\r\nopportunity of infection arises before the patient comes into the hands\r\nof the surgeon in the Field hospital.\r\n\r\nThe general tendency of such suppurations when they occurred in\r\nuncomplicated flesh wounds was to remain superficial, either involving\r\nthe contused margin of the cutaneous opening and the plug of blood-clot\r\noccupying it, and resulting in a slight enlargement of the wound only,\r\nor at most involving the subcutaneous tissue and not extending into the\r\ndeep planes of the trunk or limbs. In either case a slight delay in\r\nhealing was the most serious result, while constitutional signs of\r\ninfection were either absent or of the slightest nature. The same\r\nindisposition to spread by the track was equally noted when a deep\r\nportion became infected from, for instance, the intestine in a belly\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nWounds of irregular type, however, such as those caused by ricochet\r\nbullets, or accompanying severe fractures, or those caused by fragments\r\nof larger projectiles, often suppurated freely in spite of exposure to\r\nno more unsatisfactory surrounding conditions than the wounds of small\r\nbore. This appears to show conclusively that the first element in the\r\ngeneral slight consequences of small-bore wounds is their calibre, and,\r\nsecondly, that increase of velocity on the part of the bullet, while it\r\nin some measure compensates for the loss of volume in the projectile, on\r\nthe other hand reacts in favour of the wounded in so far as the injuries\r\nit effects on the soft tissues are ill suited to the development of\r\nseptic organisms in the parts.\r\n\r\n_Retained bullets._--These were met with more frequently than might have\r\nbeen expected, but I can give no idea as to their proportional\r\noccurrence, since so many of the slighter injuries never came under my\r\nobservation. Experience, however, showed that the bullets of large\r\ncalibre and low velocity employed during the campaign were far more\r\ncommonly lodged in proportion to the frequency of their use. Thus I saw\r\na considerable number of Martini-Henry, Snider, large leaden sporting\r\nbullets, and shrapnel retained. Again, among the bullets of smaller\r\ncalibre, the Guedes 8-mm. bullet, which travels at a comparatively low\r\nrate of velocity and with moderate spin, was far more frequently lodged\r\nthan the Lee-Metford or Mauser in comparison with the number of Guedes\r\nrifles in use.\r\n\r\nBullets of small calibre were, however, also retained with some degree\r\nof frequency, either as the result of striking at a long range, or in\r\nsuch a direction as to need to traverse a large segment of the body\r\nbefore escaping, or as striking large or several bones, or making some\r\nirregular form of impact: the last was a not infrequent explanation of\r\nlodgment, especially when a bone lay in the course of the track.\r\nRicochet bullets naturally were especially likely to be retained, both\r\non account of the low velocity with which they often travel and the\r\nirregularity of their surface with consequent loss of penetrating power.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF IRREGULAR TYPE\r\n\r\nMany of the wounds met with deviated so greatly in appearance and\r\ngeneral characters from what has been described above as to afford\r\nlittle or no evidence of having been inflicted by small-calibre bullets,\r\nand before describing these it is necessary to give a short account of\r\nthe circumstances which are responsible for such departures from the\r\ncommon type. In the case of the wound of entry, the simplest\r\nexplanations are lateral impact on the part of the cylindro-conoidal\r\nprojectile, due to the position of the part struck or the direction in\r\nwhich the bullet has been fired, wobbling on the part of the bullet due\r\nsimply to loss of velocity and force in flight, or to turning of the\r\nbullet by impact with an obstacle to its course (ricochet) which may\r\namount to actual reversal of the striking end. As a rule, in such cases\r\nthe size of the aperture of entry exceeds that of exit, and in a large\r\nproportion the bullet is retained within the body.\r\n\r\nOf these explanations that of the 'wobble' needs some passing notice. In\r\nits simplest form it depends merely on loss of velocity of flight on the\r\npart of the bullet, the centre of gravity of which lies behind its\r\nmiddle; hence a tendency to turn over and over is acquired. As a result\r\nof this, either the side of the tip, the side of the bullet, the side of\r\nthe base, or the base itself may form the portion of the projectile\r\nwhich comes into contact with the body. The tendency to wobble is\r\nnaturally greatly increased in ricochet bullets, since the contact, if\r\nlateral, serves to check the spin on which the bullet depends for its\r\nflight on an axis parallel to its long diameter. The first effect of\r\nwobbling is to increase the size and interfere with the regularity of\r\noutline of the wound of entry; but it also acts in a more serious\r\nmanner, since the increase of the area of impact augments the resistance\r\noffered by the body; therefore the degree of damage to the tissues is\r\naccentuated and becomes greater than it would be from a bullet\r\ntravelling at the same rate on its normal axis. Hence the wounds are\r\nboth large and severe, or if the velocity is very low, the projectile is\r\nespecially likely to be retained.\r\n\r\nActual reversal of the bullet usually only slightly enlarges the\r\naperture of entry, but injuries to cancellous bone are apt to be more\r\nsevere when the bullet enters in this manner, or again it is often\r\nretained. I saw several such cases during the campaign.\r\n\r\nAnother form of wobble is suggested by Nimier and Laval,[9] of which I\r\ncan offer no experience. They suggest that, as rotation slows, the\r\nbullet may on impact wobble like a top before it ceases to spin.\r\nProbably the power of penetration possessed by a bullet wobbling in this\r\nmanner would not be very great, but its effect would mainly be altered\r\nin the direction of an abnormal increase in the size of the aperture of\r\nentry, or possibly in the degree of comminution in fractures.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that some of the more serious wounds observed were merely\r\nthe result of unusual forms of impact with normal flight on the part of\r\nthe bullet. The majority, however, depended, in the case of the wound of\r\nexit, on deformation of the bullet within the body, or the propulsion of\r\nbone fragments with it, and, when both apertures were affected, to\r\nprevious ricochet on the part of the projectile.\r\n\r\nIt is here necessary to give a short account of the more common\r\ndeformities met with, and to refer to the special characters possessed\r\nby different types of bullet of small calibre which may affect the ease\r\nwith which deformity is produced, and the degree to which it is commonly\r\ncarried. The effect of ricochet is to lower the velocity of flight, and\r\nat the same time to effect certain alterations of form in the bullet.\r\nThese with rectangular impact in the case of bullets travelling at a low\r\ndegree of velocity consist in a bending and deformation of the tip; in\r\nthe higher degrees, of bending, shortening, extensive destruction, or\r\ncomplete fragmentation. If the bullet makes lateral impact, only\r\nwidening and flattening result, often with the escape of the lead core\r\nfrom the mantle. That a ricochet bullet may travel a considerable\r\ndistance is shown by the following observations quoted from Nimier and\r\nLaval.[10]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Sections of four Bullets to show relative shape\r\nand thickness of mantles.\r\n\r\nFrom left to right: 1. Guedes; regular dome-shaped tip; mild steel\r\nmantle; thickness at tip 0.8 mm.; at sides of body 0.3 mm. 2.\r\nLee-Metford; ogival tip; cupro-nickel mantle; thickness at tip 0.8 mm.;\r\ngradual decrease at sides to 0.4 mm. 3. Mauser; pointed dome tip, steel\r\nmantle plated with copper alloy; thickness at tip 0.8 mm.; gradual\r\ndecrease at sides to 0.4 mm. 4. Krag-Joergensen; ogival tip as in\r\nLee-Metford; steel mantle plated with cupro-nickel; thickness at tip 0.6\r\nmm.; gradual decrease at sides to 0.4 mm. The measurements of the sides\r\nare taken 2.5 cm. from the tip. Note the more gradual thinning in the\r\nLee-Metford mantle.]\r\n\r\nUp to a distance of 1,700 to 1,800 metres the bullet may make several\r\nricochet bounds. When the bullet strikes first at short distances (as\r\n600 metres), it may make several bounds of from 300 to 400 metres: at\r\nmoderate distances (as from 600 to 1,200 metres), bounds of 200 to 300\r\nmetres; and at distances above 1,200 metres, bounds of 100 to 200\r\nmetres. The length of the ricochet bounds depends on the angle of impact\r\nof the bullet with the ground, the nature of the slope of the latter,\r\nand the velocity of the bullet.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the question of calibre and volume of the bullets we are\r\nconcerned with, I believe the most important variations as serious\r\neffects of ricochet depend on the relative thickness and the composition\r\nof the mantles. Fig. 26 illustrates the relative thickness of the\r\nmantles in the Krag-Joergensen, Mauser, Lee-Metford, and Guedes bullets.\r\nGiven an equal degree of force and velocity on the part of the bullet at\r\nthe moment of impact, the assumption is justifiable that the thinner\r\nmantles would tear or burst more readily in direct ratio to their\r\nrelative thinness. I believe this assumption to be borne out by my own\r\nexperience of the common deformities that occurred; but the great\r\nrelative frequency with which Mauser bullets came under my observation,\r\nand the difficulty of forming any estimate of the velocity and force\r\nretained by any particular bullet at the moment of impact, make it\r\nimpossible for me to express myself with the confidence which I should\r\nwish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Normal Mauser Bullet]\r\n\r\nThe second condition which influences the nature and degree of the\r\ndeformities depends on the relative tenacity or brittleness peculiar to\r\nthe metal employed in the manufacture of the mantles. In the case of the\r\nLee-Metford this consists of an alloy of 80 parts of nickel with 20 of\r\ncopper. The Krag-Joergensen and Mauser are ensheathed in steel plated\r\nwith cupro-nickel, and the Guedes has a plain steel envelope coated with\r\nwax.\r\n\r\nBoth as a result of experience in the field gained from ricochet\r\nbullets, and in the hospitals from bullets which had undergone\r\ndeformation within the body, I am under the firm impression that the\r\nthin nickel-plated steel envelope of the Mauser bullet splits more\r\nreadily than the thicker and more tenacious cupro-nickel envelope of the\r\nLee-Metford, that the direction of the ruptures is more purely\r\nlongitudinal, and the fissuring itself more extensive and complete.\r\n\r\nI append below a series of deformities observed in Mauser bullets, some\r\nof which were collected on the field of battle, but all of which were\r\nfamiliar to me in bullets removed from the bodies of patients, except\r\nthe complete disc shape shown in fig. 29. They correspond with specimens\r\nof which I made sketches at the time of removal from the body, but which\r\nI had not the heart to retain in view of the natural wish of the\r\npatients to keep them as mementoes of their wounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Four common types of lateral Mauser Ricochet\r\nBullets.\r\n\r\nFrom left to right: 1. Slipper form; slight broadening and turning of\r\ntip. 2. More pronounced degree of form 1, with laceration of the mantle\r\nopposite the shoulder of the bullet. This is the weakest spot, for two\r\nreasons: the alteration in curve at this position, and the junction of\r\nthe thickened point of the mantle with the thinner sides. 3. Lateral\r\nricochet involving nearly whole length of bullet. Rupture of mantle from\r\nbroadening of core opposite shoulder. 4. Similar lateral ricochet with\r\nextensive longitudinal rupture of mantle, the latter being turned out\r\nand forming a cutting 'flange.']\r\n\r\nSlight indentations and deviations from strict symmetry of form of such\r\ndegree as not seriously to influence the outline and nature of the\r\napertures were very common. Beyond these one of the most frequent\r\nprimary deformities was that we familiarly spoke of as the 'slipper\r\nform' (No. 1, fig. 28). This results from light glancing contact of the\r\ntip with a hard body: in it the mantle of the bullet is rarely\r\nfractured, and the deformity itself is of slight importance, except in\r\nso far as it may influence the direction of the wound track, which\r\nacquires a tendency to be curved. The tip of the bullet is slightly\r\nflattened and turned up, down, or to one side, according to the point\r\nstruck. I saw this deformity frequently, both with Lee-Metford and\r\nMauser bullets. Nos. 2, 3, and 4 are more pronounced degrees of the same\r\ntype of deformity, accompanied by more or less extensive fissuring of\r\nthe mantle. No. 4 illustrates the turning out of the longitudinally\r\nfissured mantle in such a way as to make a cutting flange. I have seen\r\nsuch bullets removed, and the variety is of some importance as\r\nmaterially increasing the cutting capabilities of the bullet, and\r\naugmenting its area of destructive action. No. 5, fig. 29, is the only\r\nform I have not seen removed, but such a bullet would account for some\r\nof the long irregular gutter wounds observed, if it retained sufficient\r\nvelocity to strike with any force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--'Disc'-shaped Lateral Ricochet. This form is of\r\nlittle practical importance, as the velocity retained by the bullet is\r\nlow, and no perforating power would be retained. It is inserted\r\nseparately in order to complete the series, shown in fig. 28.]\r\n\r\nFig. 30 illustrates complete longitudinal fissuring of the mantle. Such\r\nmantles are common, and still more so are the opened-out sheets such as\r\nis shown still attached in fig. 29. Free mantles are often very numerous\r\non stony ground, but are of little importance, since I never saw\r\nfragments of them removed or impacted. They probably travel a very short\r\ndistance after their formation, and if they did strike would possess\r\nlittle power of penetration. The freed leaden cores do, however,\r\nsometimes enter the body, and some of the specimens removed have been\r\nreferred to the use of expanding bullets. In all the Mauser specimens\r\nthe longitudinal direction of the fissuring of the mantle is striking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Ruptured Mauser Mantle, to illustrate the\r\ntendency to complete longitudinal fissuring]\r\n\r\nFig. 31 represents bullets removed from the body and illustrates types\r\nof deformity due to impact with the bones. The deformity resembles in\r\nsome degree that of the mushroomed lead cores, and also indicates that\r\nthe shoulder of the cased bullet is its weakest point. Each specimen\r\nexhibits shortening and widening without fracture of the mantle, the\r\nlatter being simply thrown into folds; both bullets were lodged in the\r\nthigh after fracturing the femur. The localisation of injury to the fore\r\npart of the bullet, and the fact of expansion, allow us to infer that\r\nthe degree of velocity retained on impact with the bone was\r\ncomparatively low, and that neither bullet had been exposed to very\r\nsevere strain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Two retained Mauser Bullets which had produced\r\ncomminuted fractures of the femur of moderate severity. Each has given\r\nway at the shoulder, but the mantle has developed creases without\r\nrupture, and the bullets are correspondingly bent. Both bullets were\r\ntravelling at a moderate if not low degree of velocity]\r\n\r\nFig. 32 is also of a retained bullet in which the fore part of the\r\nmantle is very extensively fissured and the core set free. In this the\r\nmantle has suffered severely and the leaden core to a less extent. As an\r\napical ricochet it corresponds with the Lee-Metford shown in fig. 36.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Apical Ricochet Mauser Bullet (see text). The\r\n'mushrooming' of the core is moderate, but the destruction of the\r\nanterior part of the mantle very considerable]\r\n\r\nThe deformity found in fig. 32 I met with both in retained bullets and\r\nalso in those which had been fired into sand or anthills. The particular\r\nspecimen figured was removed from the thigh of a patient wounded at the\r\nbattle of Belmont. An irregular entry wound was situated over the\r\ninternal tuberosity of the tibia, while a large fluctuating haematoma\r\nexisted in the lower third of the thigh, at the upper part of which a\r\nhard elongated body was palpable. As was so often the case with internal\r\nhaemorrhages, the patient's temperature rose high, and on the third day\r\nthe haematoma was incised by Major Coutts, R.A.M.C. The core of the\r\nbullet was then found in the blood cavity near the surface, but on\r\nintroduction of the finger a second body was discovered entangled in the\r\nquadriceps muscle, and this proved to be the tattered mantle. I saw\r\nsimilar deformity produced within the body by a bullet, which, entering\r\nby a small type aperture in the left ala of the nose, struck the margin\r\nof the right malar bone, and lodged beneath the latter. The similarity\r\nof this bullet to that seen in the ricochet in fig. 32 was exact. The\r\nform is of great importance both on account of the degree of laceration\r\nit effects in the track, the presence of two foreign bodies in the\r\nwound, and from the fact that it can be produced by making the bullet\r\ntravel through sand or antheaps, since both the former in the shape of\r\nsandbags and the latter in their natural state so often formed the cover\r\nto men during the campaign. Bullets of 6.5 mm., such as the\r\nKrag-Joergensen, with steel envelopes apparently break up with great ease\r\nin sand.\r\n\r\nFig. 33 shows a form not uncommon when the bullet comes into contact\r\nwith the ribs. It is produced in bullets travelling at a low rate of\r\nvelocity and striking by their side. I several times met with it when\r\nthe bullet was retained, and also without fracture of the rib. In some\r\nvariety it might occur after impact with any narrow margin of bone, and\r\nsome importance attaches to the form, since it affords evidence as to\r\nthe ease with which alterations in symmetry can be produced in Mauser\r\nbullets. Again its bent outline favours deviation in the further course\r\nof the bullet subsequent to impact with the bone, a result which I\r\nobserved on more than one occasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Grooved Mauser removed from anterior abdominal\r\nwall after crossing the ribs. I saw several such removed from the\r\nthoracic wall, and am inclined to attribute the grooving to impact with\r\nthe margin of the ribs]\r\n\r\nLastly, the question of actual spluttering or breaking up of the bullets\r\nmust be considered. It is extraordinary into how many fragments either a\r\nLee-Metford or a Mauser bullet may break up if it strike a hard body\r\nwhile travelling at a high rate of velocity. Fragmentation is exhibited\r\nin the skiagram forming the subject of plate XI. p. 194. It is somewhat\r\nremarkable how often this occurred when the short hard bones of the\r\nmetacarpus were struck. With regard to the casing, the separation of\r\nsmall scales of the nickel plating has already been referred to;\r\nreference to the skiagrams, plates IX. and XVI., shows how readily the\r\nwhole thickness of the mantle breaks up into small fragments, even when\r\nthe bullet is travelling at moderately low degrees of velocity, and\r\nthis I believe to be a special characteristic of the thin\r\ncupro-nickel-plated steel mantles.\r\n\r\nAny variety of cased bullet, however, when it strikes against a stone,\r\nhard ground, or a bone, may be broken into innumerable fragments. The\r\nleaden fragments occasionally show a simple fractured surface, such as\r\nis illustrated on a larger scale by the broken shrapnel bullets shown in\r\nfig. 96, p. 485. More commonly, however, the fragments, if of any size,\r\nappear torn, and if small, are mere spicules. These if of lancet shape\r\noften bury themselves in the skin only, while larger ones may penetrate\r\ndeeply or even perforate. Thus, of a group of three officers standing\r\nnear a stone on which a bullet struck, all were spattered about the\r\nface; most of the fragments lodged in the skin, but one perforated the\r\nconcha of the ear and bruised the mastoid area, while others caused\r\nsmall jagged cuts. In another instance, both thighs of the patient were\r\nspattered after perforation of the clothes, and a large fragment lodged\r\nbeneath the skin of the penis. A case in which larger fragments\r\nperforated and simulated type wounds has already been referred to on p.\r\n44.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Normal Lee-Metford Bullet]\r\n\r\nThe above remarks apply, for the most part, to Mauser bullets only,\r\nbecause my experience of that projectile was far wider than of the\r\nLee-Metford. The only deformed Lee-Metford bullets that I saw removed\r\nfrom the body were of the 'slipper' variety, exactly corresponding to\r\nthe similarly altered Mausers, and with no fissuring of the mantle. I\r\nsaw none so freely deformed as the Mausers depicted in figs. 28, 29, 31,\r\nand 32.\r\n\r\nIn spite of diligent search on several battlefields, I was unable to\r\ncollect many forms of Lee-Metford ricochet, although I found many\r\nundeformed bullets. I insert here, therefore, some illustrations I\r\nobtained through the kindness of Colonel Hopton, Director of the School\r\nof Musketry at Hythe, which are of interest, and in some degree\r\nsubstantiate the impression I formed in South Africa as to the greater\r\nstability of the Mark II. Lee-Metford bullet (fig. 34). I am aware that,\r\nas meeting a smooth target at right angles, some of these are not\r\nstrictly comparable to the Mauser bullets forming the subjects of the\r\npreceding illustrations, which struck stones, and these mainly by their\r\nsides (if we except figs. 31 and 32), but they sufficiently exhibit the\r\ncharacters on which I wish to insist. That they support my opinion is\r\nthe more probable as, with the exception of the type included above, I\r\nam under the impression that the large majority, if not all, of the\r\nMauser bullets which struck stones fairly with their tips were broken to\r\npieces, otherwise I must have met with some among the immense number\r\nwhich I saw. On the top of Tabanyama, for instance, the whole ground was\r\nlittered at the time of my visit with shattered mantles and leaden\r\ncores, deformed almost past recognition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Apical Lee-Metford Ricochets. From Hythe\r\ntargets. Tendency of cupro-nickel envelope to tear in transverse\r\ndirection]\r\n\r\nThe specimens depicted in figs. 35 and 36 indicate--(1) a greater\r\nmalleability on the part of the mantle; thus in fig. 35 the cupro-nickel\r\nis obviously hammered and flattened out, while the fissures are neither\r\nnumerous nor extensive. (2) Both bullets exhibit transverse tearing of\r\nthe mantle, a common feature in Lee-Metford ricochets, of which I could\r\noffer other examples, but which I less often observed in Mauser\r\nbullets. (3) Tear is the term best expressing the nature of the\r\nfissures, while fracture more nearly expresses the nature of the\r\nfissures in the Mauser mantles. (4) Fig. 36 shows a mushroomed core and\r\nsplit mantle, which may be compared with the similarly deformed Mauser\r\ndepicted in fig. 31. I think the variation in appearance is\r\ncharacteristic, the fissuring of the mantle being much less extreme,\r\nwhile the leaden core is normal at its base in consequence of the\r\nsupport afforded by the more tenacious cupro-nickel mantle. With regard\r\nto complete splitting of the mantles, however, I must add that free\r\nLee-Metford mantles are often found from bullets fired at the target or\r\nelsewhere, and Nimier and Laval figure numerous forms.[11]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Apical Lee-Metford Target Ricochet. Well-marked\r\n'mushrooming' of core. 'Torn' nature of the fissures in the mantle and\r\nlimited extent. Compare with fig. 32]\r\n\r\n_Expanding bullets._--The wounds resulting from perforation with\r\ndeformed regulation bullets, such as are described above, differ for the\r\nmost part by deviation from the type appearances, and a tendency to take\r\na less favourable course on account of their increased size and of the\r\ngreater degree of laceration of the tissues accompanying them. I must\r\nnow pass on to the consideration of the forms of bullet especially\r\nlikely to occasion those wounds spoken of as 'explosive' in character,\r\nand my remarks on these must be prefaced by a short description of the\r\nvarieties which were in use during the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Four Soft-nosed Bullets from Boer trenches.\r\n\r\nFrom left to right: 1. Mauser (.275); small amount of core exposed. 2.\r\nLee-Metford (.303). 3. Lee-Metford, with larger amount of exposed core,\r\nalso cupped apex. This is probably the most effective of these forms. 4.\r\nMannlicher (.315)]\r\n\r\nThese consisted in soft-nosed bullets of the Mauser and Lee-Metford\r\npatterns, Tweedie and Jeffreys modifications of the Lee-Metford and\r\nMauser, several soft-nosed bullets of a slightly larger calibre, mostly\r\nold Mauser or Mannlicher types, and a large variety of sporting leaden\r\nbullets of larger calibre and volume. Figs. 37 and 43.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the various soft-nosed bullets of small calibre, I will\r\nfirst advert to a feature common to all, which consists in a solid base\r\nto the mantle. In the regulation whole-cased bullets the leaden core is\r\ninserted from the base, and the edge of the mantle is then so turned\r\nover for fixation purposes as to leave the central portion of the lead\r\nexposed. The position of the exposed portion of the core is therefore\r\nreversed in the two varieties. The small experience I had the\r\nopportunity of obtaining was all to the effect that the solid base\r\nconsiderably increases the stability of the mantle, and I never saw the\r\nlatter seriously torn in any specimen either collected on the field or\r\nremoved from the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Two Soft-nosed Lee-Metford Bullets (see text).\r\n1. Removed from forearm. 2. Removed from beneath skin of back after it\r\nhad perforated the scapula. In both the velocity retained was no doubt\r\nlow, and neither encountered great resistance]\r\n\r\nFig. 38, 1, represents a soft-nosed Lee-Metford removed from just below\r\nthe lesser sigmoid cavity of the ulna, after it had perforated the\r\nelbow-joint. The soft nose appears to have been torn, and separated by\r\nimpact with the bone, but the mantle is little altered. There can be\r\nlittle doubt, however, that the bullet was travelling at a comparatively\r\nlow rate of velocity, since it was retained in the forearm, whence its\r\nvarious parts were removed by Major Lougheed, R.A.M.C. I picked up a\r\nnumber of similarly deformed bullets on the field. No. 2 represents a\r\nsoft-nosed Lee-Metford which perforated the scapula from the front; the\r\nbullet was retained, hence again velocity cannot have been very high,\r\nand the comminution was slight. If it had passed out, a large exit wound\r\nwould, however, have resulted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. Soft-nosed Lee-Metford Mantle. Lateral ricochet.\r\nIllustrating effect of solid base in maintaining the stability of the\r\nmantle]\r\n\r\nFig. 39 represents a type of ricochet sometimes found on the field. In\r\nspite of a considerable amount of violence which has caused the escape\r\nof the core, the fissuring of the mantle is comparatively slight. In\r\npoint of fact, the casing is, as a rule, preserved from the severe\r\nviolence it suffers when complete, by the flattening and turning over of\r\nthe soft nose. I am sorry I cannot append an illustration of a damaged\r\nsoft-nosed Mauser, but I am of opinion that those used during the\r\ncampaign were not of a very dangerous nature on account of the small\r\namount of lead exposed. To gain the full advantage of the soft nose at\r\nleast a third of the core should be exposed. No. 3, fig. 37, of a\r\nLee-Metford, probably represents the most effective form of such\r\nbullets. I am inclined to think these bullets as a class, however, are\r\nnot more dangerous to the wounded man than the regulation Mauser fired\r\nat short range, if the latter either comes into contact with bone or\r\nsuffers ricochet.\r\n\r\nThe Tweedie and Jeffreys bullets come under a somewhat different\r\ncategory. In the Tweedie the top of the bullet is sawn off in such a\r\nmanner as to flatten the tip and widen the surface of direct impact, and\r\nto expose the leaden core over a small area. The general principle of\r\nthe flat tip resembles that of the French Lebel bullet. In the Jeffreys\r\nmodification the mantle is sawn down for about half the length of the\r\nwhole mantle, the slits neither reaching tip nor base. I seldom saw\r\nthese bullets removed, but they were used to a considerable extent. Fig.\r\n40 illustrates one of Mauser calibre in the possession of Mr. Cuthbert\r\nS. Wallace. It perforated the abdomen, producing fatal injuries, but the\r\nonly alteration in outline consists in slight bulging and shortening.\r\nThis specimen, however, manifestly suffered but slight resistance. A\r\nsomewhat general impression existed that a number of severe injuries had\r\nbeen produced by the Jeffreys bullets, but it was a matter of\r\nconjecture, as few of them were removed. A weekly illustration appears\r\nin the advertisement sheet of the 'Field,' showing the deformity of some\r\nof them shot into animals, which bear a strong resemblance to the Mauser\r\nfigured earlier (fig. 31), and which we have seen can be produced in the\r\nhuman body by contact of a regulation fully cased bullet with a bone\r\nlike the malar. A tendency on the part of the longitudinal slits to\r\nbecome caught in the rifling of the barrel militates against the use of\r\nthis bullet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Jeffreys modification of Mauser. The bullet is\r\nin the possession of Mr. C. S. Wallace. It perforated the abdomen and\r\ncaused death. The bullet is only slightly shortened by bulging at the\r\nshoulder]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--1. Section of Mark IV. Lee-Metford. Note\r\nthickness of mantle and exposed core at base. 2. Soft-nosed Mauser. Note\r\nsolid base. Short pattern]\r\n\r\nFig. 41 represents sections of the soft-nosed Mauser, and the British\r\nMark IV. bullet, and shows the different method of closure of the base.\r\nIf the former remarks on the influence of the closed base in maintaining\r\nthe stability of the bullet be correct, Mark IV. should be a very\r\ndestructive bullet. I have no experience of its use, but I am inclined\r\nto think that here, as elsewhere, the thickness and resistance of the\r\ncupro-nickel mantle would endow it with considerable stability, unless\r\nit met with very great resistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Types of Bullets tampered with by the Boers in\r\nthe trenches. 1 and 3. Cross-cut tips, Martini-Henry and Lee-Metford. 2.\r\nGroove cut at base of exposed tip of Lee-Metford. Another modification\r\nof the Martini-Henry consisted in boring it longitudinally and inserting\r\na wooden plug]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the subject of soft-nosed bullets, I should mention\r\nthat the Boers occasionally extemporised various modifications of them,\r\nsuch as are shown in fig. 42, with intent to increase the wounding power\r\nof the projectiles. I am unable, however, to give any information as to\r\nthe effects produced by these, and I do not think they were often\r\nemployed. The illustrations are from cartridges found in trenches which\r\nhad been occupied for some time by the Boers, who had no doubt used\r\ntheir spare time in exercising their ingenuity on the bullets.\r\n\r\n'Explosive' bullets of small calibre were also said to have been\r\nemployed; with regard to these I can only say that I never met with any\r\nexample of a hollow bullet containing explosive material.\r\n\r\nOne officer in a Colonial corps who spoke freely about them, told me he\r\nhad 'sawn' them in half and found the cavities, but the method of\r\ninvestigation he had employed seemed against the presence of any\r\nfulminant in the body of the bullets. Others based their statements on\r\nthe fact that they had frequently heard the bullets burst in the air;\r\nbut this is probably to be explained by the breaking up of regulation\r\nbullets on impact with stones, which makes a smart crack like a small\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nA clip of soft-nosed Mauser cartridges, in which a copper centre to the\r\nbullet suggested a percussion-cap, was sent home to the War Office.\r\nColonel Montgomery has kindly furnished me with the following report on\r\nthe bullet:\r\n\r\n'The bullet contains no explosive matter, it is fitted with a hollow\r\ncopper tube in the nose, similar to the ordinary \"Express\" bullet. The\r\nenvelope is made with a solid base, which is possible in this bullet\r\nowing to the core being inserted from the front.'\r\n\r\nOne cannot help feeling some astonishment at the strong feeling that has\r\nbeen exhibited regarding the use of expanding bullets of small calibre,\r\nboth at the Hague Conference and during this campaign, when the\r\nMartini-Henry, a far more dangerous and destructive missile in its\r\neffects at moderate ranges, is allowed to pass muster without notice.\r\n\r\nLastly, we come to bullets of large calibre unprovided with a mantle.\r\nThe Martini-Henry is practically representative of all these, but I\r\nappend a photograph of some twenty out of thirty varieties which came\r\ninto my possession during searches amongst captured ammunition. Some of\r\nthese were provided with a copper core to facilitate 'setting up,'\r\nothers were cupped at the top, and others flattened, to increase the\r\nresistance on impact. I can say little about them except that I believe\r\nsome of the forms were responsible for a considerable proportion of the\r\nmost severe injuries we met with, in some of which a large and regular\r\nentry made their use certain, while a considerable proportion of them\r\nwere retained. In the case of the viscera their power of doing serious\r\ndamage was very striking compared with that of the bullets of small\r\ncalibre. As with the small sporting bullets I think their use was often\r\ndue to the fact that the sporting Boer preferred to use the weapon he\r\nwas accustomed to rather than his military weapon.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of the Boers were armed with Martini-Henry rifles,\r\nand this was particularly the case with small bodies of men, rather than\r\nwith the larger commandos fighting regular engagements. The Transvaal\r\nGovernment, moreover, had Martini-Henry rifles made as late as 1898. The\r\nMartini-Henry bullet was responsible for some of the worst fractures\r\nthat came under my notice, but it is of interest to remark that its\r\ncapability to do damage did not satisfy some of the Boers, who cut them\r\nas is shown in fig. 43. I cannot say what the effect of this manoeuvre\r\nwas, although it may have accounted for some of the wounds of the calf\r\nsuch as are mentioned below.\r\n\r\nSome odd missiles were met with during the campaign; thus, at Ladysmith,\r\nI was told ball bicycle bearings were at one time in use amongst the\r\nBoers.\r\n\r\n_Anatomical characters of wounds of irregular type._--It will be seen\r\nfrom the above that in dealing with wounds of irregular type we have to\r\nconsider those due to irregular impact of normal regulation bullets, to\r\nbullets deformed by contact with bone, to ricochet bullets, and lastly\r\nto bullets of the expanding type.\r\n\r\nNo further mention of those due to irregular impact is needful beyond\r\nwhat has already been said under the heading of wobbling, except to\r\npoint out that, given a fair degree of velocity, these injuries may\r\nassume an actual explosive character, especially in the case of skull\r\nfractures. The description of extensive wounds accompanying comminuted\r\nfractures finds its most appropriate place under the heading of injuries\r\nto the bones, and will be there considered (Chapter V. p. 155).\r\n\r\n'Explosive' exit apertures are, however, described as occasionally\r\noccurring in injuries involving the soft parts only. I saw no cases\r\nsubstantiating this belief, but several were described to me as having\r\nbeen met with in abdominal injuries, which terminated fatally at an\r\nearly date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Four Soft-nosed Bullets of small calibre shown\r\nin fig. 37. Twenty large-calibre leaden carbine and rifle bullets from\r\ncartridges found in Boer arsenals. These were not very extensively used,\r\nbut specimens of most varieties were at times removed from our wounded\r\nmen. It will be noted that some are of great weight, and a large\r\nproportion either cupped or flattened at the apex to increase area of\r\nimpact and consequent resistance. The 'express' bullet with a copper\r\ncore is included in this series. It is worth remarking that all the\r\nbullets of this nature in the Pretoria Arsenal were waxed, and that the\r\nwax retained its white colour on the lead.]\r\n\r\nI still, however, incline to the opinion that the bullet in these cases\r\nhad come into contact with some bone, or was one of the larger varieties\r\nof projectile. A few cases of wound of the calf did, however, come under\r\nmy observation which presented fairly typical 'explosive' characters\r\nwithout evidence of solution of continuity of the bones. I will shortly\r\nrecount two of them. In the first the exit opening was very large and on\r\nthe outer aspect of the limb in the upper third. The bullet had\r\napparently passed between the bones. Secondary haemorrhage from the\r\nanterior tibial artery necessitated exploration of the wound and\r\nligature of the vessel (Mr. Carre). When the wound was thus laid open no\r\ninjury to the bones could be detected, but I do not consider that it\r\ncould be actually excluded. In the second case a wound traversed the\r\ncalf transversely, just above the centre; the exit aperture was large\r\nand ragged. Deep suppuration occurred, and the wound had to be laid\r\nopen, when a fracture of the tibia without solution of continuity was\r\ndiscovered. I also saw one or two wounds of the buttock in which very\r\nlarge exit apertures were present with small entry openings; in these\r\nagain it was impossible to exclude passing contact of the bullet with a\r\npart of the pelvic wall. Unfortunately in all these cases it is\r\nimpossible to obtain the bullet responsible for the injury. In this\r\nrelation I append a diagrammatic illustration of a peculiar wound shown\r\nto me by Mr. Hanwell. In this case a typical small entry wound was\r\nsituated at the outer margin of the left erector spinae muscle in the\r\nloin. The bullet had taken a subcutaneous course of not more than\r\nthree-quarters of an inch, while the exit opening was a long shallow\r\nwound measuring 4-1/2 in. in length by 1-1/2 in. width. (Fig. 44.)\r\n\r\nThe wound was stated to have been received at a distance of from fifty\r\nto a hundred yards. I think we can scarcely assume that impact with the\r\nmargin of the erector spinae could have resulted in 'setting up' of the\r\nbullet, while an irregular tongue of skin at the point where the wound\r\ncrossed the spines of the lumbar vertebrae did suggest possible bony\r\ncontact. That the latter must have been of the slightest nature is\r\nevident, as no signs of concussion of the spinal cord were noted. I\r\nshould rather be inclined to compare this case to one of gutter wound\r\nquoted on p. 56, and to assume that the bullet passed so closely\r\nbeneath the surface as either to entirely sever the skin, or at any rate\r\nto allow it to give way on flexion of the back on movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Small Circular Entry, large 'explosive' skin\r\nwound of back. Track only an inch or less in length (see text)]\r\n\r\nOn the ground of the observations made in the foregoing pages it will be\r\ngathered that the opinion I formed was against either the very free use\r\nor the great wounding power of so-called expanding bullets of small\r\ncalibre. I believe that a great number of the injuries which were\r\nattributed to the employment of these missiles were produced either by\r\nricochet regulation bullets of small calibre, or by large leaden bullets\r\nof the Martini-Henry type.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--I very much doubt whether the general symptoms observed as\r\nthe result of wounds from bullets of small calibre differ in more than\r\nslight degree from those described when larger bullets were regularly\r\nemployed. Great variation was met with, but I do not think a diminution\r\nin serious results in this direction corresponding to the comparatively\r\nlimited nature of the direct injury to the organs or tissues can be\r\naffirmed. It is true that the immediate symptoms in many patients were\r\namazingly slight, but after all, this has always been a feature of\r\ngunshot injuries on the field of battle and cannot be assigned a\r\nposition of distinctive importance.\r\n\r\n1. _Psychical disturbance and shock._--Some remarkable instances of\r\npsychical disturbance were observed, and although perhaps in no way\r\ninfluenced by the calibre of the projectile, they seem worthy of note in\r\nthis place. Thus a patient wounded over the cervical spine and who\r\nsuffered later with a slight degree of spinal concussion emitted an\r\ninvoluntary shriek like that of a wounded hare on being struck; another\r\n(Martini wound), after receiving a wound of the chest, lost all sense of\r\nhis surroundings for a considerable period, and occupied himself in\r\nattempts to write on a white stone lying near him on the veldt; then\r\nsuddenly realising his position he was greatly bewildered in trying to\r\naccount for his own action. A similar instance of preoccupation is\r\nprobably offered by the dead man in the accompanying photograph (fig.\r\n45), whose arms, forearms, and hands had evidently been in play until\r\nthe actual moment of death. Again the influence of the psychical state\r\non the actual occurrence of shock was often illustrated by the mental\r\ncondition of the wounded after a battle; thus after the battles of\r\nBelmont and Graspan the patients came into hospital in excellent\r\nspirits, and minimised their injuries in the wish of rapidly regaining\r\nthe front; while after the battle of Magersfontein the men were\r\ndepressed and miserable, shock was more pronounced, and their sufferings\r\nwere undoubtedly greater.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, shock was by no means a prominent symptom in the\r\nsmall-bore injuries of soft parts, and was possibly less than when\r\nlarger bullets were the rule, and again it was often remarkably slight\r\nafter the infliction of serious visceral injury. Still shock was\r\nobserved in a considerable proportion of the patients, and its\r\noccurrence appeared to vary under very much the same conditions as\r\nobtain in civil practice. Grades of severity depended on individual\r\nidiosyncrasy, on the degree of excitement or preoccupation at the moment\r\nof injury, and to a certain degree on the range of fire at which the\r\ninjury was received.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Note position of head, neck, and forearms in\r\nupper figure]\r\n\r\nThe last is the only special factor, and as far as my observation went\r\nit was one of considerable importance. When the soft parts only were\r\naffected, even high velocity did not produce much effect; but when to a\r\nflesh wound a severe bone fracture or injury to any part of the nervous\r\nsystem was added, shock might be severe or profound. The question of\r\nshock dependent on visceral injury will be considered in succeeding\r\nchapters, but it may be well to state here that the most severe shock\r\nappeared to follow injuries to the central nervous system especially to\r\nthe spinal cord, fracture of the larger bones, and wounds of the\r\nabdominal and thoracic viscera, the latter especially when the cardiac\r\nneighbourhood was encroached upon: hence the severity depended almost\r\nsolely on the importance of the part injured and the degree of damage\r\ninflicted. I never observed instances of entire absence of shock in\r\nvisceral injuries, unless the range of fire had been an especially long\r\none.\r\n\r\nTo these remarks on constitutional shock I should add a few on the\r\n'local shock' exhibited by the actual part of the body struck. The\r\nphenomena were of a severity I was quite unacquainted with in civil\r\npractice, and apparently were attributable to the local vibration\r\ntransmitted to the whole structure of a limb or part of the trunk. In\r\nmany fractures, and in some wounds of the soft parts alone, without the\r\ndirect implication of any large nerve trunk, the loss of functional\r\ncapacity of the limb was complete, and this condition persisted for\r\nhours or even days.\r\n\r\n2. _Pain._--As an initial symptom the occurrence of pain varied greatly\r\nwith the idiosyncrasy of the patient, and according to the circumstances\r\nunder which the wound was received. Some individuals are remarkably\r\ninsensitive, and in these the fact of a wound being a gunshot injury in\r\nno way altered their habitual insensibility, but in persons of what may\r\nbe termed the normal type in this particular great differences were\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nWhen a wound was received in the full excitement of battle during a\r\nrapid advance, pain was often slight, or so trifling in degree that it\r\nwas almost unnoticed; many patients did not realise that they had been\r\nstruck until a second wound, possibly implicating a bone or some\r\nspecially sensitive structure, was superadded. In such instances the\r\npain was often described as 'burning' in character, or even likened to a\r\n'sting from an insect.' Occasionally the pain was referred to a distant\r\npart; thus a man struck in the head first felt pain in the great toe,\r\nand another struck in the abdomen also felt pain in his foot only. Again\r\nin some multiple injuries, pain was only felt in the more sensitive of\r\nthe regions implicated; thus a patient in whom a bullet (Martini)\r\ntraversed the arm and chest emerging in the neck to again enter the chin\r\nand comminute the mandible, only felt pain in the chin and first\r\nrealised that he had been wounded elsewhere when he undressed. A\r\nstriking instance of the entire absence of initial pain was afforded by\r\na man shot through the buttock, the bullet then traversing the abdomen:\r\nthis patient remained unaware that he had been hit until on undressing\r\nhe found blood in his trousers and exclaimed: 'Why I have got this\r\nbloody dysentery!' None the less his internal injuries were sufficiently\r\nsevere to lead to death during the next thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\nAlthough initial pain might be slight or absent, practically all the\r\npatients complained of some of varying severity at the end of an hour\r\nafter reception of the wound.\r\n\r\nIn a large proportion of the wounded, however, pain was more or less\r\nsevere from the first, and this was especially the case when the men had\r\nbeen exposed to fire for some hours behind inadequate 'cover.' The most\r\ncommon descriptions under these circumstances were that they felt as if\r\nthey had been struck by 'a brick,' 'a ton of lead,' or 'a\r\nsledge-hammer.'\r\n\r\n3. _Haemorrhage._--This question is fully treated under the heading of\r\ninjuries to the blood-vessels. It will suffice here to say that\r\nhaemorrhage was rarely of a dangerous nature so far as life was\r\nconcerned, unless the large visceral vessels or those in the walls of\r\nserous cavities were concerned, when death was often rapid. From limb\r\nwounds, even when the largest trunks were implicated, the general\r\ntendency was to spontaneous cessation of the haemorrhage. Consequently,\r\nexcept these patients were seen on the field, one seldom had to deal\r\nwith serious bleeding. None the less, the condition of the patients'\r\nclothes bore testimony to a free rush immediately after the injury, and\r\npools of blood were occasionally found where patients had lain. In\r\nnearly all cases the rush of the bullet determined the initial flow of\r\nthe blood from the exit wound, and this aperture usually furnished any\r\nhaemorrhage of importance.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The only diagnostic point which it is necessary to\r\nconsider in this chapter is the determination of the nature of the\r\nbullet which has caused the particular injury under observation, and\r\nthis is more a matter of interest than importance.\r\n\r\nThe primary indication lies in the size of the aperture of entry, which\r\nnaturally varies with the calibre of the bullet employed, and the\r\ndifference, except in the case of large projectiles, is not always\r\neasily determined, unless we can be sure that the impact of the bullet\r\nwas at right angles. In the latter case it is possible to distinguish\r\neven between, for instance, a Lee-Metford and a Mauser wound, if the\r\nresistance likely to be offered by the part struck is kept in mind. A\r\nricochet bullet, on the other hand, may upset all our calculations, if\r\nsize alone be taken as an indication; but here the irregularity of the\r\nwound often serves to exclude one of the larger varieties as the cause.\r\nThe appearances of the exit wound are less useful in determining the\r\nnature of the bullet employed, as irregularities of outline are so much\r\nmore common whatever projectile may have emerged; but examination of\r\nthis wound often gives us useful information as to the existence of an\r\ninjury to the bones not involving loss of continuity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Two flattened Leaden Cores to illustrate means\r\nof determination of nature of bullet. Note ring at base. The right-hand\r\nbullet is probably a 'man-stopping' revolver bullet; it flattened\r\nagainst bone]\r\n\r\nOther information beyond that furnished by the external wounds may be\r\ngleaned from the presence of fragments of lead in the wound; these, if\r\nunaccompanied by portions of casing, afford some presumptive evidence of\r\nthe use of an unsheathen bullet, especially if found on the fractured\r\nsurface of the bones; but it must be borne in mind that in the case of\r\nricochet bullets the leaden core often perforates when entirely freed\r\nfrom its mantle. Pieces of the mantle again may give useful information\r\nboth from examination of their thickness and composition. Lastly a naked\r\ncore nearly always retains the marking on its base corresponding to the\r\nturning over of the mantle, this not being likely to suffer impact\r\ncalculated to efface the groove. When this groove existed the employment\r\nof any of the soft-nosed bullets used in this campaign might be safely\r\nexcluded (fig. 46).\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The question of general mortality amongst the wounded has\r\nalready been considered (Chapter I. p. 11), and it has been shown,\r\nputting aside those dying at once on the field, or during the first\r\ntwenty-four hours, that the mortality was a low one. Some other points\r\nspecially dependent on the nature of the injury are, however, worthy of\r\nmention in this place. First, it has been shown, with a slight\r\nreservation as to when a wound can be considered definitely sound, that\r\nif suppuration did not occur, healing was rapid, and that many men with\r\nslight wounds were back with their regiments in the course of a very few\r\ndays. Again, that suppuration when it did occur tended to be local in\r\ncharacter; none the less, if it was at all extensive, it often proved\r\nvery prolonged and difficult of treatment, while residual abscesses\r\nafter apparent healing were not uncommon. In connection with this\r\nsubject I may quote from Colonel Stevenson[12] an observation that limbs\r\nthe subject of marked local shock are especially liable to furnish\r\nseptic discharges. Parts the subject of local shock when infected show a\r\nlesser degree of vitality and power of resistance to the spread of\r\ninfection than do normal ones, and if infected do badly. I think I\r\nconvinced myself of this on many occasions, and also of the fact that\r\ncases of fracture in which this condition was marked were slow in\r\nconsolidating. Again I am inclined to think that the bad results which\r\nsometimes followed the tying of the limb arteries were also consequent\r\non lowered vitality, and possibly vaso-motor disturbance due to the\r\neffects of the exquisite vibratory force to which the nerves had been\r\nsubjected. On this account I was never anxious to hurry operations in\r\nsuch cases, unless obviously necessary at the moment.\r\n\r\nThe larger question of general nervous breakdown as the result of\r\ninjuries from bullets of small calibre is at present hardly capable of\r\nan answer, and is so complicated by the co-existence of concurrent\r\nmental anxiety, exposure, &c., that a definite answer will always be\r\ndifficult. I think there is already sufficient evidence, however, to\r\nsuggest that the remote effects of many of these injuries may be far\r\nmore serious than we expected at the moment, especially in the direction\r\nof sclerotic changes in the nervous system.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_.--In view of the remarks on the treatment of special\r\ninjuries contained in succeeding chapters, I shall confine myself here\r\nto the question of the treatment of wounds of the soft parts alone.\r\n\r\nThis consisted during the campaign in the primary application of the\r\nregulation first field dressing by one of the wounded man's comrades, an\r\norderly, or less commonly an officer or a medical man. This dressing is\r\ncomposed of a piece of gauze, a pad of flax charpie between layers of\r\ngauze, a gauze bandage 4-1/2 yards long, a piece of mackintosh\r\nwater-proof, and two safety pins, enclosed in an air-tight cover. Mr.\r\nCheatle,[13] in insisting on the importance of an immediate antiseptic\r\ndressing in the field, recommends the following. A paste contained in a\r\ncollapsible tube, made up in the following proportions: Mercury and zinc\r\ncyanide grs. 400, tragacanth in powder gr. 1, carbolic acid grs. 40,\r\nsterilised water grs. 800; sufficient bicyanide gauze and wool for the\r\ndressing of two wounds, a bandage, and four safety pins; the whole\r\nenclosed in a mackintosh bag. The paste possesses the advantage over any\r\nliquid or powder, that it can be applied in any position of the body to\r\nsevere wounds, and its application in the open air is not interfered\r\nwith by draughts of wind. Mr. Cheatle used a similar preparation with\r\nsuccess during the campaign.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at the Field hospital, or in some cases at the station of the\r\nbearer company, the wounds were then commonly dressed as follows: The\r\nparts around the wound were cleansed with an antiseptic lotion, either\r\nsolution of perchloride of mercury 1 in 1,000, or 2-1/2 per cent.\r\nsolution of carbolic acid. The wound itself was then cleansed, and a\r\ndressing of double cyanide of mercury and zinc applied. This was covered\r\nwith a pad of wool and secured with a bandage. The gauze was usually\r\nwrung out in the lotion before application as a precaution against\r\nprevious contamination, and the moistening was also useful as helping to\r\nensure the dressing from subsequent displacement. It was early\r\nrecognised that the drier the dressing the better, and hence anything\r\nlike a mackintosh layer was carefully avoided. In some instances,\r\nantiseptic powders were employed, but they did not find much favour, and\r\nbecause they tended to favour slipping of the dressing, and to prevent\r\nthe adhesion of the gauze dressing to the wound, they were certainly not\r\ndesirable when there was any necessity for the patient to travel. In the\r\nabsence of reliable water the use of antiseptic lotions was obligatory,\r\nand such is likely to be the case in most campaigns; in the present one,\r\nfiltration of the thick muddy water was impossible, without a\r\nconsiderable expenditure of time, which could only be obtained when the\r\nhospitals were fairly stationary. I very much preferred carbolic acid\r\nlotions.\r\n\r\nThe wound having been once cleansed, or rather the surroundings of the\r\nwound, the drier the surface was kept the better; hence a too heavy or\r\nimpervious dressing was not satisfactory; in point of fact, I think some\r\nof the slighter wounds in which all the dressings slipped off, and in\r\nwhich there was less consequent chance of the dressing being moistened\r\nwith the sweat of the patient, did as well as any.\r\n\r\nI do not think the bicyanide gauze, absorbent wool, and common open-wove\r\nbandages, together with a good supply of nail brushes, soap, and\r\ncarbolic acid for the primary disinfection of the skin and the external\r\nwound, are to be greatly bettered at the present day as materials for\r\nthe first permanent dressing of cases in the field. The wound itself\r\nshould be carefully shielded during the preliminary cleansing of the\r\nskin by a firmly applied antiseptic pad, and then the dressing applied\r\nas above described. The one desirable improvement is some mode of\r\nensuring the dressing being kept in good position, and for this some\r\nform of adhesive covering for the gauze and wool should be devised. When\r\nthe atmosphere is such as to allow of rapid drying, thin moistened\r\nbook-muslin bandages would be preferable to the plain open-wove ones.\r\nThe one period of danger is that of transport, and when that is over,\r\nthe dressing in Stationary or Base hospitals should give no trouble.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the wounds themselves need no interference, but in some\r\ninstances either the exit or entrance wounds may be in undesirable\r\npositions for purposes of asepsis, when a large opening may seem safer\r\nclosed and actually sealed. I saw this method tried in a few cases, but\r\nwithout much success. It is one which might be of much use in Base\r\nhospitals if the patients were brought directly into them, but in the\r\nField hospitals, in face of the rush with which the first dressings have\r\nto be done, I think it is seldom applicable, and consider the\r\ninterference with the wound as rather likely to increase the danger of\r\ninfection than to decrease it.\r\n\r\nDressings should not be too frequent; two should suffice for simple\r\nwounds with type forms of entry and exit; there is little discharge and\r\nusually no bleeding: hence the more the dry scab form of healing can be\r\nsimulated the better. When a dressing needs changing from fouling of its\r\nouter parts, it is preferable to cut round the adherent part of the deep\r\nlayers and apply some fresh gauze over the central scab rather than to\r\nremove it. One point should be kept in mind: the first dressing in the\r\nField hospital seals the fate of the wound as to the chances of primary\r\nunion, and hence too much care is impossible with it.\r\n\r\nOperations in the Field hospitals were proportionately not numerous, and\r\nthey should be kept down in number, as far as possible. At the same time\r\nsuch operations as are necessary are mostly of capital importance, such\r\nas the treatment of fractures of the skull, abdominal section, the\r\nligature of arteries, and amputations. Of these only the first and last\r\nclasses occur with any degree of frequency. In order to be prepared for\r\nthese a stock of filtered water which has been boiled, and some special\r\nsterilised sponges, should be at hand if possible, also some small\r\ntowels which can be wrung out in antiseptic lotion. If sterilised\r\nsponges are not to be had, wool pads wrung out in carbolic lotion must\r\nbe substituted.\r\n\r\nPrimary amputations bore transport badly. I saw few sent down from the\r\nfront within a few days of their performance in which the flaps did not\r\nslough, or worse consequences ensue. On the other hand, if the first\r\nfortnight could be tided over at the front, they did well enough. The\r\nhead cases on the other hand bore movement fairly well, provided only\r\nthat asepsis was ensured.\r\n\r\nRetained bullets are rarely suitable for removal in the rush of the\r\nfirst work of a Field hospital after an engagement. A short delay is of\r\nno importance, and ensures their being removed safely if necessary. With\r\nregard to the broad question of the advisability of removing them at\r\nall, it may be laid down that they should not be interfered with unless\r\nsome obvious reason exists. Those most commonly calling for removal are\r\nas follows: 1. Bullets lying immediately beneath the skin or quite\r\nsuperficially in any region, or those which, although they have produced\r\nan exit opening, yet lie within the body. 2. Those which lie at the\r\nbottom of an infected track, or cause secondary suppuration. 3. Those\r\ncausing pressure on important structures, particularly nerves. 4. Those\r\nwhich interfere with the movements of joints when lodged in the bones or\r\nsoft tissues in close proximity, or those which lie within the articular\r\ncavity itself. Bullets sunk in the great body cavities or in positions\r\ndifficult of access should never be interfered with. Retained bullets\r\nsometimes give rise to unexpected surprises; thus in a man with a\r\nretained bullet in the pelvis no steps for its removal were taken.\r\nDuring the man's voyage home on a transport he had an attack of\r\nretention of urine. As a catheter would not pass, he was placed in a\r\nwarm bath, and shortly after passed a Mauser bullet per urethram, and\r\nthus saved himself a cystotomy.\r\n\r\nOne word may be added as to the treatment of shock when severe. Quiet in\r\nthe supine position, and the administration of a small amount of\r\nstimulant, was usually all that was required. Hypodermic injections of\r\nstrychnine sulph. grs. 1/30 to 1/10 were useful, and in some severe\r\ncases, especially where operations were needed, saline infusions with a\r\nsmall amount of stimulant were made into the veins, either at the elbow,\r\nor in amputation cases into one of the large veins exposed.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of haemorrhage is dealt with in Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nThe after treatment of simple wounds needs little comment, but bearing\r\nin mind what has been said as to the definite healing of the internal\r\nportion of the tracks, it will be obvious that in parts such as the\r\nthigh or calf, care was needed as to not commencing active work at too\r\nearly a date. On the other hand, a too long period of absolute rest is\r\nalso to be deprecated. The best results were obtained by careful\r\nmovement and massage, commenced after the first week or ten days,\r\naccording to the appearance presented by the external wound, followed by\r\na gradual resumption of active movement. It was a striking fact that\r\nsome of the patients suffering from such wounds took longer to become\r\napparently well than many of those who had suffered visceral injuries.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] _Loc. cit._ p. 31.\r\n\r\n[10] _Loc. cit._ p. 100.\r\n\r\n[11] _Loc. cit._ pp. 54, 55.\r\n\r\n[12] _Wounds in War_, p. 83.

Given primary union,\r\nthese conditions are only of importance in so far as subsequent\r\ncontraction of the lumen of the vessel may result from implication in\r\nthe neighbouring cicatrix. One of the most striking features of the\r\nwounds as a whole was seen in the hair-breadth escapes of the large limb\r\nvessels with no subsequent ill effects, and such injuries were seen in\r\nevery situation.\r\n\r\nIn a certain proportion of wounds in close proximity to large vessels,\r\nhowever, a diminution of the normal calibre of the arteries was\r\nobserved, either shortly after the injury or later in the advanced\r\nstages of cicatrisation. As an example of early obstruction, the\r\nfollowing may be related. A Mauser bullet passed from the inner side of\r\nthe thigh across the neck and great trochanter of the femur beneath the\r\nfemoral vessels, and probably struck and grooved the bone, since the\r\naperture of exit was large and irregular, some 3/4 of an inch in\r\ndiameter. One week later no pulse was palpable in either anterior or\r\nposterior tibial arteries at the ankle, and pulsation which was strong\r\nin the common femoral artery was very weak in the superficial femoral.\r\nSlight fulness existed in the hollow of Scarpa's triangle, but not\r\nsufficient to make any serious difference in the contour of the two\r\nlimbs. No thrill or abnormal murmur was discoverable. There was no\r\noedema of the limb, which was also normal in temperature. The patient\r\nwas kept at rest in the supine position for three weeks, during which\r\ntime the tibial pulses gradually returned. Three weeks later he was\r\ninvalided home, the pulses, however, still remaining considerably\r\nsmaller than normal.\r\n\r\nIn the advanced stages of cicatrisation narrowing of the lumen of the\r\ntrunk vessels was far from uncommon, especially in cases of wounds of\r\nthe arm crossing the course of the brachial artery; in many of these the\r\nradial pulse was diminished almost to imperceptibility. How far this\r\ncondition may prove permanent there has been little opportunity of\r\njudging; nor as to the possible ultimate weakening of the vessel wall\r\nand the development of a secondary aneurism has time allowed the\r\nacquisition of experience. In the light of the observation of so many\r\ncases in which large vessels were wounded without the occurrence of\r\nsevere haemorrhage, either primary or secondary, it is impossible to be\r\ncertain whether some of the cases of arterial obstruction were not\r\nsecondary to perforating lesions of the vessels.\r\n\r\nPressure on, or minor lesion of the vessel was sometimes evidenced by\r\nthe development of a murmur, as in the following case. A Mauser bullet\r\nentered immediately within and below the left coracoid process, and\r\nemerged at the back of the arm at its inner margin, 2-1/2 inches above\r\nthe junction of the right posterior axillary fold. During the first week\r\ndysphagia and some pain and soreness in the episternal notch, with pain\r\nand difficulty of respiration, were noticed. Eight weeks later no\r\ntrouble with the pharynx or oesophagus remained, but a short sharp\r\nsystolic murmur was audible over the first part of the left axillary\r\nartery, which could be extinguished by pressure on the subclavian; the\r\nradial pulse was normal.[14]\r\n\r\nWhen primary union failed or was prevented by infection and\r\nsuppuration, lesions, although incomplete, of the vessel coat naturally\r\nfrequently gave rise to secondary haemorrhage.\r\n\r\n2. _Perforation of the vessels._--(_a_) This may be oblique or\r\ntransverse to the long axis of a trunk; when the vessel is impinged upon\r\nlaterally, an oval or circular notch, as the case may be, is produced;\r\nor (_b_) the bullet may strike more or less in the centre of the vessel,\r\nperforating both in front and behind, while lateral continuity is\r\nmaintained; (_c_) beyond these degrees a vessel may, of course, be\r\ncompletely divided. Cases of notching of the vessel will be referred to\r\nunder the heading of traumatic aneurism; those of perforation under that\r\nof aneurismal varix and varicose aneurism, the perforations in these\r\ncases affecting a parallel artery and vein.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF INJURY TO THE VESSELS\r\n\r\n1. _Haemorrhage._--The fact that haemorrhage was not a prominent feature\r\nin the wounds received during this campaign can scarcely be regarded as\r\nan experience confined to injuries caused by bullets of small calibre.\r\nThe same observation was often made in the case of larger bullets in old\r\ndays, and the absence of severe haemorrhage has previously been regarded\r\nas a special characteristic of gunshot wounds. None the less, as high a\r\nproportion as 50 per cent. of deaths occurring on the field in earlier\r\ndays has been ascribed to this cause.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately no new facts can be furnished on this point, although a\r\nfew cases of rapid death from primary haemorrhage will be found recounted\r\nunder the heading of visceral injuries. Beyond these the general\r\nevidence offered by observations on men brought in from the field with\r\nvascular injuries, was opposed to the frequent occurrence of death from\r\nhaemorrhage, at any rate of an external nature. This subject will be\r\ndealt with under the classical three headings of primary, recurrent, and\r\nsecondary haemorrhage.\r\n\r\n_Primary haemorrhage._--A marked distinction needs to be drawn between\r\nexternal and internal haemorrhage. External haemorrhage from the great\r\nvessels of the limbs, or even of the neck, proved responsible for a\r\nremarkably small proportion of the deaths on the battlefield. This\r\nstatement may be made with confidence, since it is not only my own\r\nexperience, but coincides with what I was able to glean from many\r\nmedical officers with the Field bearer companies. It is, moreover,\r\nsupported by the facts that cases in which primary ligature had been\r\nresorted to were extremely rare at the Base hospitals, while, on the\r\nother hand, traumatic aneurisms and aneurismal varices of any one of the\r\ngreat trunks of the neck and limbs were comparatively common. Again,\r\nprimary amputation for small-calibre bullet wounds, except when\r\ncomplicated by severe injury to the bones, was so rare as to render more\r\nthan doubtful the frequent occurrence of severe primary haemorrhage on\r\nthe field. Only one case of rapid death due to bleeding from a limb\r\nartery was recounted to me. In this a wound of the first part of the\r\naxillary artery proved fatal in the twenty minutes occupied by the\r\nremoval of the patient to the dressing station. The amount of haemorrhage\r\nin many instances was no doubt checked by the application of pressure at\r\nthe time of the first field dressing; but it can scarcely be argued that\r\nsuch dressings as were applied were of sufficient firmness to control\r\nbleeding from such trunks as the brachial, femoral, or carotid arteries.\r\n\r\nThe spontaneous cessation of haemorrhage is rather to be ascribed to the\r\nspecial method of production and the consequent nature of the wound. The\r\nlesions were the result of immense force strictly localised in its\r\napplication, which might well induce very complete and rapid contraction\r\nof the vessel wall; while the track in the soft parts was not only\r\nnarrow, but also lined by a thin layer of tissue possibly so devitalised\r\nsuperficially as to specially favour rapid coagulation of the blood.\r\nBeyond this the tracks were often sinuous when the position of the limb\r\nat the time of reception of the injury was replaced by one of rest. The\r\ninfluence of mere narrowness of the track is illustrated by classical\r\nexperience in the development of aneurismal varices after stabs by\r\nknives or bayonets; and in the injuries under consideration the frequent\r\ndevelopment of large interstitial haemorrhages into the tissues of the\r\nlimbs indicated that blood does not readily travel along the wound\r\ntrack. It was noteworthy that when haemorrhage did occur it was most free\r\nfrom, or often limited to, the wound of exit. This is due to the\r\ndirection of the active current set up by the rush of the bullet through\r\nthe tissues. The mechanical factor is, no doubt, the most important.\r\n\r\nControl of primary haemorrhage from a wounded vessel by the impaction of\r\na foreign body was of much less frequent occurrence than appears to have\r\nbeen the case with the older bullets. I saw a case in which, on removal\r\nof a fragment of shell (Mr. S. W. F. Richardson), very free haemorrhage\r\noccurred from a wound of one of the circumflex arteries of the thigh,\r\nbut not a single one in which a similar result followed the extraction\r\nof a bullet of small calibre. The comparative infrequency of retention\r\nof modern bullets is probably one of the main elements in this relation.\r\nA very curious instance of provisional plugging of a wound in the upper\r\npart of the brachial artery by an inserted loop of the musculo-spiral\r\nnerve was related to me by Mr. Clinton Dent. This instance must, I\r\nthink, be regarded as an accident definitely dependent on the size and\r\noutline of the bullet and on the nature of the force transmitted by it\r\nto neighbouring structures.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, deaths from external primary haemorrhage were rare, a\r\nconsiderable number resulted from primary internal haemorrhage. In some\r\nof these, injury to the largest trunks in the thorax or abdomen led to\r\nan immediately fatal issue; in others wounds of the large visceral\r\narteries, as of the lungs, liver, or mesentery, were scarcely less rapid\r\nin their results. In such cases the potential space offered by the\r\nperitoneal or pleural cavities favours the ready escape of blood from\r\nthe wounded vessel, while the tendency of the blood effused into serous\r\ncavities to rapid coagulation is notably slight. Beyond this the\r\ncomparative deficiency in direct support afforded by surrounding\r\nstructures to vessels running in the large body cavities is also an\r\nimportant element in their behaviour when wounded.\r\n\r\nThese remarks receive support from the observation that few, if any,\r\npatients survived an injury to the external iliac vessels within the\r\nabdomen, while the remarkable instances of escape from fatal haemorrhage\r\nfrom large vessels recorded below (cases 1-19) indicate that the mere\r\nsize of a wounded vessel is not to be regarded as the sole factor in\r\nprognosis.\r\n\r\n_Recurrent haemorrhage_ was occasionally met with both in the case of the\r\nlimb and trunk vessels. In the limbs it often necessitated ligature of\r\nthe artery. I saw several cases in the lower extremity where recurrent\r\nhaemorrhage on the second or third day was treated by ligature of the\r\nfemoral or popliteal artery, and it also occurred during the course of\r\ndevelopment of one of the carotid aneurisms recounted below. On two\r\noccasions I saw rapid death follow recurrent abdominal haemorrhage; in\r\none I was standing in a tent when a man who had been wounded the day\r\nbefore suddenly exclaimed: 'Why, I am going to die after all.' The\r\nappearance of the man was ghastly, and on examining the abdomen it was\r\nfound greatly distended, and with dulness in the flanks; the patient\r\nexpired a few minutes later. Another example of recurrent abdominal\r\nhaemorrhage is related in case 169, p. 432.\r\n\r\n_Secondary haemorrhage._--In simple wounds of the soft parts by\r\n_small-calibre bullets_ this was decidedly rare. In wounds complicated\r\nby fractures of the bones, especially when they exhibited the so-called\r\n'explosive' character, secondary haemorrhage was not uncommon, and this\r\nnot necessarily in conjunction with infection and suppuration.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on fracture some remarks will be found on the\r\nprolongation of healing often observed in the exit portion of the wound\r\ntrack, which is explained by the well-known fact that, given an aseptic\r\ncondition of the wound, sloughs of tissue separate very slowly.\r\nSecondary haemorrhage in these cases is due to lesions of the vessel\r\nshort of perforation, but severe enough to so lower the vitality that\r\nlocal gangrene of the wall occurs. In such instances haemorrhage most\r\nusually occurred on the tenth to the fourteenth day, but occasionally\r\nstill later. In one instance of ligature of the anterior tibial artery\r\nfor such haemorrhage three-quarters of the whole lumen of the vessel had\r\nbeen devitalised. The resemblance of some cases of secondary haemorrhage\r\nof this class to those occasionally observed after amputation, and due\r\nto accidental non-perforative injury of the artery at the time of\r\noperation above the point of ligature, was very striking.\r\n\r\nIn other cases secondary haemorrhage was the result of perforation of the\r\nvessel by a sharp spicule of bone, but in the large majority sepsis and\r\nsuppuration were the cause. Naturally therefore the accident was\r\ncommoner in the more severe kinds of wound, and in those caused by\r\n_large_ bullets or fragments of shell. The symptoms in nearly all cases\r\nwere the classical ones of repeated small haemorrhages followed by a\r\nsudden copious gush.\r\n\r\nThe forms of secondary haemorrhage, however, which afforded most interest\r\nwere the interstitial and the internal, mainly on account of the scope\r\nthey allowed for diagnosis.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic examples of internal secondary haemorrhage are furnished\r\nby cases of chest injury accompanied by haemothorax and fully dealt with\r\nunder that heading (Chapter X.). Cases of interstitial secondary\r\nhaemorrhage are also described under the heading of traumatic aneurism\r\nand abdominal injuries (No. 194, p. 445). It therefore suffices here\r\nmerely to remark on the diagnostic difficulties the condition gave rise\r\nto. These mainly depended upon the elevation of general bodily\r\ntemperature by which the haemorrhage was often accompanied. Further\r\nevidence of the condition was furnished by the development of local\r\nswellings, or physical signs indicative of the collection of fluid in a\r\nserous cavity. These signs developed rapidly, and the rise of\r\ntemperature was sudden and decided enough to suggest commencing\r\nsuppuration. In several cases incisions were made under the supposition\r\nthat this had already occurred.\r\n\r\nThe fever accompanying blood effusions was generally a somewhat special\r\nfeature in the wounds of the campaign. At first bearing in mind that in\r\nevery case a track, even if closed, led from the surface to the effused\r\nblood, one was disposed to suspect an infection of the clot of a\r\nsomewhat innocuous nature. The absence of subsequent suppuration,\r\nhowever, was definitely opposed to this view, and suggested that the\r\nfever resulted from absorption of some element of the blood, possibly\r\nthe fibrin ferment, or some form of albumose. A pronounced illustration\r\nwas in fact afforded of the evanescent rise of temperature usually the\r\naccompaniment of simple fractures in the case of the limbs, and of the\r\nmore marked rise not uncommon in cases of traumatic blood effusion into\r\nthe peritoneal cavity, or when the pleurae or joints were the seats of\r\nthe mischief. In the case of interstitial haemorrhages I only remember to\r\nhave seen fever of such marked continued type in the subjects of\r\nhaemophilia with recent effusions, although one is of course acquainted\r\nwith it in a less pronounced form as a result of haemorrhage into\r\noperation wounds.\r\n\r\nIn primary interstitial haemorrhages a similar continued rise of\r\ntemperature was also common, and I cannot perhaps better illustrate its\r\ncharacter than by the brief relation of two instances.\r\n\r\nIn a patient wounded at Kamelfontein the bullet entered four inches\r\nbelow the acromion, pierced the deltoid, splintered the humerus, and\r\ncrossed the axilla. A large blood extravasation developed in the axilla,\r\naccompanied by cutaneous ecchymosis extending halfway down the arm.\r\nThere was no perceptible pulsation in either the brachial or radial\r\nartery, but the limb was warm. There was partial paralysis of the parts\r\nsupplied by the ulnar and musculo-spiral nerves and complete loss of\r\npower and sensation in the area of distribution of the median nerve. Six\r\nmonths later the radial pulse was still absent in this patient, but\r\nthere was no sign of the development of an aneurism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 1.--Axillary Haematoma. Shows range of\r\ntemperature during process of absorption and consolidation without\r\nsuppuration]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying temperature chart is characteristic. The blood\r\neffusion gradually gained in consistency and underwent steady diminution\r\nin size. No suppuration occurred.\r\n\r\nThe median paralysis was found to be accompanied by the inclusion of the\r\nnerve in a sort of foramen of callus, when the patient was explored at a\r\nlater date by Mr. Ballance.\r\n\r\nIn a patient wounded at Paardeberg, a Mauser bullet entered by the left\r\nbuttock, pierced the venter ilii, traversed the pelvis, and emerging at\r\nthe brim of the latter, crossed the back, fractured the spine of the\r\nfourth lumbar vertebra, and escaped below the twelfth right rib. The\r\ntrack suppurated where it crossed the back, but the man did well until\r\nthe twentieth day, when a swelling developed in the left iliac fossa and\r\nthe general temperature rose to 102 deg.. An abscess was at once suspected\r\nand the swelling incised by Major Lougheed, R.A.M.C. A large\r\nsubperitoneal haematoma only was discovered, and evacuated. The\r\ntemperature at once fell and the after progress was uneventful, the\r\nwound healing by primary union.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF HAEMORRHAGE\r\n\r\n_Primary._--No deviation from the ordinary rules of surgery should be\r\nnecessary in the majority of cases, but in a certain number the\r\nconditions are so unusual that the special considerations must be taken\r\ninto account. The natural tendency to spontaneous cessation of primary\r\nhaemorrhage in small-calibre wounds is the first of these. Experience has\r\nshown that often mere dressing, or at any rate slight pressure, suffices\r\nto efficiently stanch immediate bleeding. Although, however, immediate\r\ncontrol is to be obtained by such means, the cases of traumatic aneurism\r\nof every variety related in the next section show that the ultimate\r\nresult is in many such cases by no means satisfactory.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it may be said that the classical rule of\r\nligation at the point of injury should never be disregarded. Against\r\nthis, however, certain objections may be at once raised; thus in many\r\ncases both artery and vein need ligature, a consideration of much\r\nimportance in the case of such vessels as the carotid and femoral\r\narteries. Again in many of the injuries to the popliteal artery the\r\nwound directly communicated with the knee joint, a complication which,\r\nwhile it may be disregarded in civil practice, must take a much more\r\nimportant place in the circumstances under which many operations in\r\nmilitary surgery are performed.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it seems clear that the military surgeon must be guided by\r\ncircumstances, since it may be far better to risk the chances of\r\nrecurrent haemorrhage, or the development of an aneurism or varix, all of\r\nwhich are amenable to successful treatment later, than those of gangrene\r\nof a limb or softening of the brain. As a general rule, therefore, on\r\nthe field or in a Field hospital, primary ligature of the great vessels\r\nis best reserved for those cases only in which haemorrhage persists,\r\nwhile in those in which spontaneous cessation has occurred, or in which\r\nbleeding is readily controlled by pressure, rest and an expectant\r\nattitude are to be preferred.\r\n\r\nA word must be added as to the objections to distant proximal ligature\r\nfor primary or recurrent haemorrhage. In some situations this may be\r\nunavoidable, and it is sometimes successful, but none the less it is\r\nopposed to all rules of good surgery and a most uncertain procedure. It\r\nleaves the patient exposed to all the risks attendant on the employment\r\nof simple pressure. In one case which I saw, the third part of the\r\nsubclavian artery had been ligatured for axillary bleeding; secondary\r\nhaemorrhage, as might have been expected, occurred, and that as late as\r\nfive weeks after the operation. In another case ligature of the femoral\r\nartery for popliteal haemorrhage was followed by the development of a\r\ntraumatic aneurism in the ham.\r\n\r\n_Secondary._--In secondary haemorrhage the treatment to be adopted\r\ndepends upon the nature of the case. When the wound is aseptic, and\r\nbleeding the result of the separation of sloughs, local ligature is the\r\nproper treatment, and this was often successfully adopted, especially in\r\nthe case of such arteries as the tibials. In septic cases, on the other\r\nhand, it is usually far better if possible to amputate, unless the\r\ngeneral state of the patient and the local conditions are especially\r\nfavourable.\r\n\r\nWhen neither amputation nor direct local ligature is practicable,\r\nproximal ligature may be of use. Sometimes this may be obligatory in\r\nconsequence of the difficulties attendant on direct local treatment. I\r\nsaw a few cases successfully treated in this manner: in one the common\r\ncarotid was tied (Mr. Jameson) for haemorrhage from an arterial haematoma\r\nin connection with the internal maxillary artery. Although ligature of\r\nthe external carotid would perhaps have been preferable, the result was\r\nexcellent. When even this expedient is impracticable, local pressure is\r\nthe only resort.\r\n\r\nLastly, as to the treatment of secondary interstitial blood effusions, I\r\nbelieve the best initial treatment is the expectant. If interference is\r\nneeded, it is much more likely to be satisfactory the more chronic the\r\ncondition has become, since the source of the bleeding may be impossible\r\nto discover. I never saw a patient's life endangered by the amount of\r\nsuch haemorrhage, but if this should seem to be likely, local treatment\r\nis of course unavoidable. In several cases quoted below, incision and\r\nevacuation were followed by excellent results; in any such operation too\r\nmuch care to ensure asepsis is impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAUMATIC ANEURISMS\r\n\r\nThe experience of the campaign fully bears out that of the past as to\r\nthe steady increase of the number of aneurisms from gunshot wounds in\r\ndirect ratio to diminution in the size of the projectiles employed.\r\nEvery variety of traumatic aneurism was met with, and most frequently of\r\nall, perhaps, aneurismal varices and varicose aneurisms. While so\r\nexperienced a military surgeon as Pirogoff could say, in 1864, that he\r\nhad never seen a case of aneurismal varix, every young surgeon lately in\r\nSouth Africa has met with a series. Again, although the condition is a\r\nwell-known one, it has been rather in connection with civil life; for\r\nthe great majority of recorded cases were the result of stabs or\r\npunctured wounds such as are liable to be received in street brawls, or\r\nas a result of accidents with the tools of mechanics. Thus of ninety\r\ncases collected by K. Bardeleben in 1871, only 12 or 13.33 per cent.\r\nwere the result of gunshot wound.\r\n\r\n_False traumatic aneurism or arterial haematoma._--This condition was met\r\nwith comparatively frequently, and bears a very close relation to that\r\nalready described under the heading of interstitial haemorrhages. The\r\nlatter might almost have been included here, since the difference\r\nbetween the two conditions depended merely on the size of the vessels\r\nimplicated. The exact correspondence in the period of development of\r\nsome of the arterial haematomata, and of the occurrence of the aseptic\r\nform of secondary haemorrhage, also explains the pathology of the two\r\nconditions as identical; except that in the former the effused blood is\r\nretained in the tissues, while in the latter it escapes externally. The\r\nhistory of these cases was uniform and characteristic. A wound of the\r\nsoft parts, or sometimes a fracture, was accompanied by a certain degree\r\nof primary interstitial haemorrhage, which might or might not have been\r\nassociated with external bleeding. A haematoma resulted in connection\r\nwith the wounded vessel, the general tendency in the effusion being to\r\ncoagulation at the margins and subsequent contraction. Meanwhile the\r\nopening in the artery became more or less securely closed by the\r\ndevelopment of thrombus, and possibly by retraction of the inner and\r\nmiddle coats of the vessel. With the return of full circulatory force as\r\nshock passed off, or with the resumption of activity and consequent\r\nfreer movement of the limb, the temporary thrombus became washed away.\r\nThe newly formed wall of soft clot bounding the effusion proved\r\ninsufficient to withstand the full force of the blood pressure, and\r\nextension of the cavity resulted. In the more rapidly developing\r\nhaematomata, temporary pressure by the effused blood on the bleeding\r\nvessels was also, no doubt, a common explanation of temporary cessation\r\nof increase in size.\r\n\r\nA diffuse soft fluctuating swelling, sometimes accompanied by pulsation,\r\nbut oftener without, developed, and not uncommonly diffusion was\r\naccompanied by some discoloration of the surface and elevation of the\r\ngeneral temperature. Such arterial haematomata commonly developed from\r\nten days to three weeks after the original wound. A few examples will\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\n     (1) A patient wounded at Elandslaagte was sent down to Wynberg.\r\n     The antero-posterior wound in the upper third of the arm was\r\n     healed, but a month after the injury a large fluctuating\r\n     arterial haematoma developed in the axilla and upper third of\r\n     the arm. This was incised (Colonel Stevenson) and a wound of\r\n     the axillary artery in its third part discovered, and the\r\n     vessel ligatured. The patient made an excellent recovery.\r\n\r\n     (2) A patient received a wound at Doornkop which traversed the\r\n     calf in an obliquely antero-posterior longitudinal direction.\r\n     Three weeks later a soft fluctuating swelling developed at the\r\n     inner margin of the tendo Achillis occupying the lower third of\r\n     the leg. Neither pulsation nor murmur was detected. There was\r\n     anaesthesia in the area of distribution of the posterior tibial\r\n     nerve. No tendency to further increase was observed, and\r\n     operation was postponed. The temperature was normal.\r\n\r\n     (3) An Imperial Yeoman was struck at Zwartskopfontein at a\r\n     range of one hundred yards. The man rode four miles on his\r\n     horse after being hit, but the horse then fell and rolled over\r\n     him twice. The man was treated successively in the Van Alen,\r\n     Boshof, and Kimberley Hospitals, and from the last he was sent\r\n     to Wynberg which place he reached on the twenty-third day. When\r\n     admitted into No. 2 General Hospital the wounds of type form\r\n     and size (_entry_, in posterior fold of axilla; _exit_, 1-1/2\r\n     inch below junction of anterior fold with arm) were healed. The\r\n     whole upper arm was swollen and discoloured, while an indurated\r\n     mass extended along the line of the vessels into the axilla.\r\n     This was considered a blood effusion; it was not obviously\r\n     distensile, and pulsation was very slight. The brachial radial\r\n     and ulnar pulses were absent. A fluctuating swelling was\r\n     present along the anterior border of the deltoid. There were\r\n     some signs of nerve contusion, but no paralysis, beyond tactile\r\n     anaesthesia in the area of distribution of the median nerve.\r\n\r\n     Four days later little alteration had been noticed beyond a\r\n     tendency to variation in firmness of the different parts of the\r\n     swelling. On the thirty-first day considerable enlargement was\r\n     observed. This enlargement, together with continued rise of\r\n     temperature, aroused the suspicion of suppuration, and an\r\n     exploratory puncture with a von Graefe's knife was made by\r\n     Major Lougheed, R.A.M.C., after consultation with Professor\r\n     Chiene. Blood clot first escaped, followed by free arterial\r\n     haemorrhage. The incision was enlarged while compression of the\r\n     third part of the subclavian was maintained; a large quantity\r\n     of clot was turned out, and an obliquely oval wound half an\r\n     inch in long diameter was found in the axillary artery.\r\n     Ligatures were applied above and below the opening between the\r\n     converging heads of the median nerve. The veins were not\r\n     damaged. The wound healed by first intention. On the twelfth\r\n     day a feeble radial pulse was perceptible, and shortly\r\n     afterwards the man left for England, diminished median tactile\r\n     sensation being the only remnant of the original symptoms.\r\n\r\n     (4) A private of the 2nd Rifle Brigade was struck while\r\n     doubling at Geluk, at a range of one hundred yards. The Mauser\r\n     bullet entered four inches above the upper border of the left\r\n     patella, internal to the mid line of the limb, and escaped in\r\n     the centre of the popliteal space. The man lay in a farmhouse\r\n     during the night and bled considerably from both wounds. He did\r\n     not fall when struck, but could not walk. He was sent to No. 2\r\n     General Hospital in Pretoria. On arrival there the external\r\n     wounds were scabbed over, and a large tumour existed beneath\r\n     the entrance wound. There was much discoloration from\r\n     ecchymosis, but no pulsation could be detected. The posterior\r\n     tibial pulse was good. At the end of ten days pulsation became\r\n     marked both in the front of the limb and in the popliteal\r\n     space. There were no symptoms of nerve injury. On the\r\n     thirteenth day an Esmarch's bandage was applied and Major\r\n     Lougheed laid the tumour open opposite the opening in the\r\n     adductor magnus. Much clot was removed, and both artery and\r\n     vein, which were found divided in the adductor canal, were\r\n     ligatured.\r\n\r\n     The foot remained very cold for the first twenty-four hours,\r\n     but otherwise progress was satisfactory, the wound healing by\r\n     first intention. No pulsation was palpable in the tibials at\r\n     the end of a month.\r\n\r\nFor the last two cases I am very much indebted to Major Lougheed. I am\r\nglad to include them, as they illustrate one or two points of special\r\nimportance. No. 3 shows the tendency to variation in the tension and\r\nfirmness of the tumours, the tendency to primary contraction of the sac,\r\nfollowed by diffusion, and the rise of temperature often accompanying\r\nthe latter occurrence. This is of great interest in relation to the\r\nsimilar rise of temperature seen with the increase of haemorrhage in\r\ncases of haemothorax. For purposes of comparison, the progress may well\r\nbe considered alongside of that in the case related on p. 119, in which\r\nthe wounded vessel was probably also the main trunk itself.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 differs from any of the others in depending on a complete division\r\nof a large artery and vein. The development of the haematoma was\r\nconsequently more rapid and continuous. Another point of interest was\r\nthe maintenance of pulsation in the tibial vessels, in spite of complete\r\nsolution of continuity in the parent trunk. That this was independent of\r\nthe collateral circulation seems evident from its complete disappearance\r\nand slowness of return after ligation of the wounded vessels.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis and treatment._--The treatment in these cases is sufficiently\r\nobvious, and consists in direct incision and ligature of the wounded\r\nvessels. The cases related show the success with which this procedure\r\nwas attended, since uniformly good results were obtained. When possible,\r\nan Esmarch's tourniquet should be applied in the case of the lower limb.\r\nIn the upper, compression of the subclavian is necessary during\r\ninterference with axillary haematomata, combined with direct pressure on\r\nthe bleeding spot after the clot has been removed. In the case of the\r\narm, digital compression is always to be preferred, in view of the\r\nwell-known danger of damage to the brachial nerves from the tourniquet.\r\n\r\nProximal ligature is always to be avoided. It is inadequate, and proved\r\nmore dangerous as far as the vitality of the limb was concerned, the\r\nlatter point probably depending on the interference with the collateral\r\ncirculation by pressure from the extravasated blood, which is unrelieved\r\nby the operation. I know of at least two cases of gangrene which\r\noccurred consecutively to proximal ligature of the femoral artery for\r\nthis condition.\r\n\r\n_True traumatic aneurisms._--The cases met with differed so little from\r\nthose seen in ordinary civil practice, that but slight notice of them is\r\nnecessary. They differed from the last variety mainly in the more\r\nlocalised nature of the tumour, the greater firmness of its walls, and\r\nthe more pronounced expansile pulsation. The development of this form of\r\naneurism was probably influenced by several circumstances, such as the\r\nmore complete rest secured for the patient, the locality in the limb as\r\naffecting movement of the spot in the vessel actually wounded, the size\r\nof the opening in the vessel, and the degree of support afforded by\r\nsurrounding structures. (Examples are furnished by cases 6-9.)\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of rest, all that I saw tended to contract and\r\nbecome firmer, and they so far resembled spontaneous aneurisms as to be\r\nreadily cured by proximal ligature of the artery. The ideal treatment no\r\ndoubt consists in local incision and ligature on either side of the\r\nwounded spot, with or without ablation of the sac. The choice of direct\r\nor proximal ligature in any case depends on the position of the\r\naneurism, and the ease with which the former operation can be carried\r\nout. In all these cases a very great advantage in the localisation and\r\ndiminution of the tumours was gained by postponing interference until\r\nthey became stationary. I need scarcely add that any evidence of\r\ndiffusion indicated immediate operation. The preference of direct or\r\nproximal ligation will probably, to a certain extent, always depend on\r\nthe personal predilection of the surgeon, but while proximal ligature\r\nhas often given good immediate results during this campaign, it cannot\r\nbe with certainty decided whether the patients are definitely protected\r\nfrom the dangers of recurrence.\r\n\r\nReference to cases 7 and 9 as illustrating the possible spontaneous cure\r\nof traumatic aneurisms is of great interest.\r\n\r\nI saw a number of cases successfully treated by proximal ligature; also\r\na number where continuous improvement followed rest, and which were sent\r\nhome for further treatment. None of these demand any special mention.\r\n\r\nOne case of a very special nature, which terminated fatally, is of great\r\ninterest:--\r\n\r\n     (5) In a man wounded at Belmont the bullet entered the second\r\n     left intercostal space and was retained in the thorax. He was\r\n     sent directly to the Base and came under the care of Mr.\r\n     Thornton at No. 1 General Hospital, Wynberg. Signs of wound of\r\n     the lung developed in the form of haemoptysis and left\r\n     haemothorax. The left radial pulse was almost imperceptible.\r\n\r\n     The entry wound did not close by primary union, and three weeks\r\n     later an incision was made into the chest in consequence of the\r\n     presence of fever, progressive emaciation, and weakness.\r\n     Breaking down blood clot was evacuated: general improvement\r\n     followed, and the radial pulse increased considerably in\r\n     volume.\r\n\r\n     A fortnight later sudden severe haemorrhage occurred from the\r\n     external wound, and the man rapidly collapsed and died. At the\r\n     post-mortem a traumatic aneurism the size of an orange was\r\n     found in connection with an oval wound in the first portion of\r\n     the left subclavian artery which admitted the tip of the\r\n     forefinger.\r\n\r\nThis case is noteworthy as an illustration of the magnitude of an artery\r\nwhich can be wounded without leading to rapid death from primary\r\nhaemorrhage, even when in communication with a serous sac, and still more\r\nas emphasising the importance of weakening of the radial pulse as a sign\r\nin connection with a wound of the upper part of the chest on the left\r\nside. It is somewhat surprising that this sign was not marked in two\r\ncases (Nos. 13 and 14, p. 140) recorded below, in which the innominate\r\nand right carotid arteries respectively were probably perforated.\r\n\r\n     (6) _Traumatic popliteal aneurism._--Wounded at Modder River.\r\n     _Entry_ (Mauser), over centre of tibia 1 inch above the\r\n     tubercle. _Exit_, about centre of popliteal space. No\r\n     haemorrhage of any importance occurred from the wound, but there\r\n     was a typical haemarthrosis, which subsided slowly. Twelve days\r\n     after the injury a pulsating swelling the size of a hen's egg,\r\n     to which attention was drawn on account of pain, was noted in\r\n     popliteal space. The pulsation extended upwards in the line of\r\n     the artery some 3 inches. The limb was placed on a splint and\r\n     treated by rest, and a month later the aneurism had decreased\r\n     to one half its former size, the wall having greatly increased\r\n     in firmness. Pulsation was easily controlled by pressure above\r\n     the tumour; there was no thrill present, but a high-pitched\r\n     bellows murmur. The patient was sent home on February 1.\r\n\r\nWhen admitted at Netley the patient came under the care of Major Dick,\r\nR.A.M.C., who ligatured the popliteal artery on the proximal side by an\r\nincision in the line of the tendon of the adductor magnus. The aneurism\r\nthen consolidated.\r\n\r\n     (7) _Traumatic popliteal aneurism._--Wounded at Magersfontein.\r\n     _Entry_ (Mauser), centre of patella. _Exit_, centre of\r\n     popliteal space; the knee was bent at the time it was struck.\r\n     There was considerable primary external haemorrhage, and so much\r\n     blood collected in the knee-joint that it was aspirated. On the\r\n     eighth day secondary haemorrhage occurred from the exit wound\r\n     and the femoral artery was tied in Hunter's canal. No further\r\n     haemorrhage occurred, but at the end of three weeks feeble\r\n     pulsation was palpable in the popliteal space, suggesting an\r\n     aneurism; the latter decreased and the patient was sent home\r\n     apparently well.\r\n\r\n     (8) _Traumatic axillary aneurism._--Wounded at Karree. The\r\n     bullet entered 2-1/2 inches below the acromial end of the right\r\n     clavicle and emerged over the 9th rib in the posterior axillary\r\n     line. The Mauser bullet was found in the patient's haversack.\r\n     Both apertures were of the slit form, and healed per primam.\r\n     Three weeks later at Wynberg a large arterial haematoma which\r\n     pulsated was noted in the axilla. Signs of injury to the\r\n     musculo-spiral nerve were also observed. The tumour altered\r\n     little, but a fortnight later Major Burton, R.A.M.C., cut down\r\n     upon it through the pectorals. The aneurism was of the third\r\n     part of the axillary artery, and a ligature was applied at the\r\n     lower margin of the pectoralis minor. The wound healed by\r\n     primary union and the aneurism rapidly shrank. The patient left\r\n     for England a month later; the musculo-spiral paralysis was\r\n     improving. I am indebted to Major Burton for the notes of this\r\n     case.\r\n\r\n     (9) _Traumatic popliteal aneurism._--Wounded in Natal. _Entry_\r\n     (Mauser), immediately above head of fibula. _Exit_, immediately\r\n     inside semi-tendinosus tendon at level of central popliteal\r\n     crease. Fulness but no pulsation was noted at end of three\r\n     weeks; seven days later pulsation was evident, and an aneurism\r\n     the size of a pigeon's egg, with firm walls, became localised\r\n     and palpable. It gave rise to no symptoms, and patient refused\r\n     operation during the three weeks he remained in hospital. The\r\n     aneurism continued to contract, and the patient was sent home.\r\n     The aneurism has since spontaneously consolidated.\r\n\r\n_Aneurismal varix and varicose (arterio-venous)\r\naneurism._--Uncomplicated cases of aneurismal varix, as might be\r\nexpected, were less common than those in which the arterio-venous\r\ncommunication was accompanied by the formation of a traumatic sac. The\r\ninitial lesion accountable for each condition was, however, probably\r\nidentical, and dependent on the passage of a bullet of small calibre\r\nacross the line of large parallel arteries and veins. Thus, obliquely\r\ncoursing antero-posterior wounds of the neck produced carotid and\r\njugular varices; vertically coursing tracks laid the subclavian vessels\r\nin communication; antero-posterior tracks the brachial, popliteal, and\r\nlower part of the femoral; and transverse tracks, the vessels of the\r\ncalf and forearm. Given an arterial wound, the mode of development of\r\nthe aneurismal sac in no way differs from that of the ordinary\r\ntraumatic variety; the main point of interest, therefore, is to seek an\r\nexplanation of the causes which may restrict the ultimate result to the\r\nformation of a pure aneurismal varix. The explanation is possibly to be\r\nfound in some of the following circumstances.\r\n\r\n_Size, position, and symmetry of the vascular wound._--It seems scarcely\r\nnecessary to insist on the calibre of the projectile, since this alone\r\ndetermined the frequency of these conditions, but it must be borne in\r\nmind that in the diameter of the bullets, classed as of small calibre\r\nduring this war, a range of from 6.5-8 mm. existed. In the case of both\r\nthe Krag-Joergensen and Mauser, the shape of the bullet also was better\r\nadapted to pure perforation of the vessels. I saw no case of\r\narterio-venous communication in which a larger bullet than one of the\r\nfour types chosen had been responsible for the primary injury, but a\r\ndifference of 1-1/2 mm. in calibre in the small projectile might well\r\ndetermine the division, the pure and symmetrical perforation of the two\r\nvessels, or the giving way of one side, so that they were deeply notched\r\ninstead of perforated.\r\n\r\nSuch positive evidence as was afforded by operation as to the exact\r\ncondition of the vessels in two cases of femoral arterio-venous aneurism\r\nwas, that in either case a clean perforation existed.\r\n\r\nIt is improbable that notching of the two vessels can primarily produce\r\na pure varix, although it may result in the formation of an\r\narterio-venous aneurism, especially if the bullet should have passed\r\nbetween the two vessels in such a way as to notch the contiguous sides.\r\nIt is impossible to say, in any given case, what the result of secondary\r\ncontraction of a sac produced in this manner may be in the determination\r\nof the ultimate relation of the vessels. In many of the cases clinically\r\ndesignated pure varix, the remains of such a sac may still actually\r\npersist. In the case also of pure perforation of the vessels, it is\r\ndifficult to believe that a localised blood cavity has not originally\r\nexisted. Given complete division of the vessels, as far as my experience\r\nwent, arterial haematoma was the uniform result.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I am inclined to believe that a symmetrical\r\nperforation of both vessels is the most common precursor of either\r\ncondition; that the pure varix is the rarer and less likely result, and\r\nthat its formation is dependent mainly on certain anatomical conditions.\r\nThe most important of these conditions are the proximity and degree of\r\ncohesion of the two vessels, the comparative spaciousness or the\r\nopposite of the vascular cleft, and the degree of support afforded by\r\nsurrounding structures.\r\n\r\nThus, the close proximity of the popliteal artery and vein, together\r\nwith the particularly firm adhesion which exists between the vessels,\r\nprobably favours the formation of a varix; again, a varix more readily\r\nforms if the femoral artery and vein are wounded in Hunter's canal than\r\nif the injury is situated high in Scarpa's triangle, where the vessels\r\nlie in a large areolar space. The passage of a bullet between an artery\r\nand vein may perhaps produce either condition, but wide separation of\r\nthe two vessels, as for instance of the subclavian artery and vein,\r\nrenders an aneurismal sac almost a certainty. These suggestions seem\r\nborne out by the cases recounted below, since the pure varices are one\r\nfemoral, one popliteal, and one axillary. I cannot include the calf and\r\nforearm cases, as the existence of a small sac could not be disproved.\r\n\r\nTo these anatomical factors certain others must be added. In most cases\r\na false sac exists at first, which tends to undergo contraction and\r\nspontaneous cure, as is observed in some of the ordinary traumatic sacs.\r\nThis history of development is moreover supported by the observation\r\nthat proximal ligature of the artery usually converts an arterio-venous\r\naneurism into an aneurismal varix. The process is no doubt favoured by\r\ncleanness and small size of the perforation, moderation in the amount of\r\nprimary haemorrhage, the tone and resistance of the surrounding tissues,\r\nspecial points in the circulatory force and condition of the blood, and\r\nthe possibility of maintaining the part at rest after the injury.\r\n\r\nAneurismal varix, when pure, was evidenced by the presence of purring\r\nthrill and machinery murmur alone. In none of the cases I saw was pain\r\nor swelling of the limb present. In one popliteal varix, slight\r\nvaricosity of the superficial veins of the leg was present, but it was\r\nnot certain that the development of this was not antecedent to the\r\ninjury, as the patient did not notice it until his attention was drawn\r\nto its existence. In none of the cases under observation in South Africa\r\nhad enough time elapsed for sufficient dilatation of the artery above\r\nthe point of communication to give rise to any confusion from this cause\r\nas to the presence of a sac.\r\n\r\nWhen an arterio-venous sac has once formed, clinical observation shows\r\nthat the general tendency is towards extension in the direction of least\r\nresistance. This direction of course varies with the situation of the\r\naneurism, and also with the nature of the wound track.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally the direction of least resistance in a typically pure\r\nperforation is towards the vein. Initial flow of blood from the wounded\r\nartery is naturally favoured towards the potential space afforded by a\r\ncanal occupied by blood flowing at a lower degree of pressure. The\r\npartial collapse of the vein dependent on the wound in its wall also\r\nprobably helps in determining the initial flow in its direction.\r\nExamples are afforded by the carotid aneurisms (cases 10, 11, and 14),\r\nand here it must be borne in mind that the outer limits of the cervical\r\nvascular cleft are those least likely to offer resistance to extension\r\nof the sac. In each the aneurisms mainly occupied the exit segment of\r\nthe track; this is the general rule, as in the case of external\r\nhaemorrhage, and is determined by the same cause.\r\n\r\nThe latter rule however finds exceptions when the entry segment is so\r\nsituated as to cross a region of lesser resistance, and case 12\r\nillustrates this point with regard to the cervical vascular cleft.\r\nExamples of the tendency to spread in the anatomical direction of least\r\nresistance are also offered by the cases of aneurism at the root of the\r\nneck, where extension was into the posterior triangle.\r\n\r\nThe further clinical history and signs are as follows. A local swelling\r\nis found, usually at first diffuse, often commencing to develop with\r\ncessation of the external haemorrhage. It increases, for the first few\r\ndays maintaining its diffuse character. If near the surface, it may be\r\nsuperficially ecchymosed. At the end of this time a tendency to\r\nlocalisation, as evidenced by increasing firmness and more definite\r\nmargination, takes place, and this is followed by general contraction\r\nand rounding off of the tumour. The latter process may be continuous,\r\nand eventually the sac may become small and stationary or ultimately\r\ndisappear and a pure varix be the result. The latter is only likely to\r\nbe the case under the most satisfactory of the conditions enumerated\r\nabove. Occasionally an opposite course may be followed, and fresh\r\nextension take place, as evidenced by enlargement of the tumour,\r\ndisappearance of sharp definition, softening, and pain. The natural\r\ntermination of such cases in the absence of interference would no doubt\r\nbe rupture, and possibly death in some positions, loss of the limb in\r\nothers. The former I never saw.\r\n\r\n_Purring thrill._--This, the pathognomonic sign of either condition, was\r\nalways present in the fully developed stage, and is probably present\r\nfrom the first unless a temporary thrombosis obstructs the vascular\r\nopenings. It was noted as early as the third day in case 13. In many of\r\nthe other patients it was palpable only with the subsidence of the\r\nprimary swelling attendant on the injury. In some of the forearm and\r\ncalf aneurisms, and in some of the popliteal, it was only discovered by\r\naccident some weeks even after the injury, but this often because no\r\nserious vascular lesion had been suspected. The thrill was widely\r\nconducted, often apparently superficial on palpation, and much more\r\npronounced with light than with forcible digital pressure.\r\n\r\nIn case 10 the _visible_ vibration in consonance with the thrill when\r\nthe vein was exposed during the operation of ligature of the carotid was\r\na novel experience to me.\r\n\r\n_Murmur._--The typical 'bee in the bag,' or 'machinery' murmur was\r\npresent in every case, and was often very widely distributed, especially\r\nover the thorax. (Cases 13, 14, and 20.)\r\n\r\nIn all three carotid cases the murmur was troublesome, being audible to\r\nthe patient at night when the head was rested on the side corresponding\r\nto the aneurism.\r\n\r\n_Expansile pulsation._--Pulsation in combination with the existence of a\r\ntumour is the main feature in the diagnosis between the conditions of\r\npure varix and varicose aneurism. It was not always existent or\r\nprominent in the earliest stages, probably from temporary blocking of\r\nthe artery, or from the diffuse and irregular nature of the cavity\r\noffering conditions unsuitable to the satisfactory transmission of the\r\nwave. When localisation had occurred it was always present.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF ANEURISMAL VARIX OR VARICOSE ANEURISM ON THE CIRCULATION\r\n\r\n(_a_) _General._--The most striking feature in these injuries is the\r\nremarkable effect of the disturbance to the even flow of the circulation\r\non the heart. This first struck me in two of the cases of carotid\r\narterio-venous aneurism recorded below (Nos. 10 and 11). In these I was\r\ninclined at first to attribute the rapid and irritable character of the\r\npulse solely to injury to the vagus, as in each laryngeal paralysis\r\npointed to concussion or contusion of the nerve. The pulse reached a\r\nrate of 120-140 to the minute. This disturbance was not of a transitory\r\nnature, for in the two cases referred to the rapid pulse persists, in\r\nspite of entire recovery of the laryngeal muscles, and the fact that in\r\none case the aneurismal sac has been absolutely cured, and in the second\r\nonly a small sac remains, in each as a result of proximal ligature of\r\nthe carotid artery. In the former a varix still exists, and at the end\r\nof seven months the pulse is still over 100. In the latter, in which a\r\nsac is still present, the pulse rate varies from 110 to 130. In each\r\ncase the condition has now existed twelve months. My attention once\r\ndirected to this point, I noted a similar acceleration of the pulse in\r\nthe case of these aneurisms elsewhere; thus in a femoral aneurism the\r\nrate was 120, and in an axillary varix of twenty years' standing which\r\ncame under my observation the pulse rate varied from 110 to 120,\r\naccording to the position of the patient. Unfortunately I had not\r\ndirected my attention to this point in the early series of cases which\r\ncame under observation.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked in cases 13 and 14 that at the expiration of a year\r\nthe pulse rate was still high, but these again are cervical aneurisms\r\neach in contact with or near the vagus.\r\n\r\nIn a case of aneurismal varix of the femoral artery of three years'\r\nstanding, which was under the charge of Mr. Mackellar, the pulse rate\r\nwas normal. In this instance great dilatation of the vessels had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThese observations raise the interesting question whether the irritable\r\ncirculation which has been classically considered one of the\r\npredisposing causes of spontaneous aneurism should not rather be\r\nregarded as a result of the condition.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Local._--In none of the cases of varix was the period of\r\nobservation long enough to allow me to determine the development of\r\ndilatation of the arterial trunk above the point of obstruction. This,\r\nhowever, is the common sequence, and no doubt will occur in those\r\npatients who resume active occupation without operation.\r\n\r\nThe effects of either condition on the distal circulation were\r\nremarkably slight. The distal pulses were little, if at all, modified in\r\nstrength or volume, and signs of venous obstruction, if present at\r\nfirst, disappeared with much rapidity. In one case (No. 15) of a large\r\narterio-venous popliteal aneurism there was considerable swelling of the\r\nleg, but in this case the sac was large and situated at the apex of the\r\nspace, and no doubt exercised external pressure on the vein.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the carotid aneurisms, especially that probably on the\r\ninternal carotid, transient faintness was a symptom in the early stages\r\nof the case. All three of the cases recorded here, however, had been the\r\nsubjects of very free haemorrhage, either primary or recurrent.\r\n\r\n     (10) _Carotid arterio-venous aneurism._--Wounded at Paardeberg.\r\n     _Entry_ (Mauser) to the right side of the Pomum Adami, _exit_\r\n     at anterior margin of left trapezius, two inches below the\r\n     angle of the jaw. There was some haemorrhage at the time from\r\n     the exit wound, but no haemoptysis; about four hours later,\r\n     however, in the Field hospital bleeding was so free that an\r\n     incision was made with the object of tying the common carotid.\r\n     During the preliminary stages of the operation bleeding ceased\r\n     and the wound was closed without exposing the vessel. The\r\n     patient remained a week in the Field hospital, and then made a\r\n     three day and night's journey in a bullock waggon to Modder\r\n     River (40 miles), and fourteen days later he was transferred to\r\n     the Base hospital at Wynberg, when the condition was as\r\n     follows. Operation and bullet wounds healed. Considerable\r\n     extravasation of blood in the posterior triangle. Beneath the\r\n     sterno-mastoid in the course of the bullet track, swelling,\r\n     thrill and pulsation over an area 1-1/2 inch wide in diameter.\r\n     Loud machinery murmur audible to the patient when the left side\r\n     of the head is placed on the pillow, and widely distributed on\r\n     auscultation. The left eye appears prominent, but the pupils\r\n     are normal and equal in size. Voice weak and husky, and there\r\n     is cough. Laryngoscopic examination showed the cords to be\r\n     untouched, but some swelling still persisted. No headache, but\r\n     giddiness is troublesome at times. Pulse 100, regular but\r\n     somewhat irritable.\r\n\r\n     The patient was kept quiet in the supine position for a month,\r\n     and during this time the condition in many ways improved. The\r\n     voice improved in strength, the pulse steadied, falling to 80,\r\n     the prominence of the left eye disappeared, and all the blood\r\n     effusion in the posterior triangle became absorbed. Meanwhile\r\n     the aneurism contracted at first, until it became oval in\r\n     outline, with a long axis of 2 inches by 1-1/2 broad extending\r\n     in the line of the wound track, but mainly situated in the exit\r\n     half. During the last fortnight, however, it remained quite\r\n     stationary in size, and as it showed no further signs of\r\n     diminution in spite of the favourable conditions under which\r\n     the patient had been placed, it was considered best to try to\r\n     ensure its consolidation by a proximal ligature. Thrill had\r\n     become slightly less pronounced, and was less evident to the\r\n     patient himself, but was otherwise unchanged. The probabilities\r\n     in this case seemed rather in favour of wound of the internal\r\n     carotid artery, and it was decided to bare the upper part of\r\n     the common carotid, follow up the main trunk, and if possible\r\n     apply the ligature to the internal branch. On April 12, 61 days\r\n     after the injury, the classical incision for securing the\r\n     common carotid was made, and the sterno-mastoid slightly\r\n     retracted. It was found that the sac of the aneurism extended\r\n     over the bifurcation of the artery, reaching to the wall of the\r\n     larynx. The omo-hyoid muscle was therefore divided, and the\r\n     artery ligatured beneath, in order to ensure against any\r\n     interference with the sac. Some difficulty was met with, for on\r\n     opening the vascular cleft the vein was exposed and found to\r\n     completely overlie the artery: although it was on the left side\r\n     of the neck, the position of the vein was so completely\r\n     superficial that there seemed no doubt that it had been\r\n     displaced by the development of the aneurismal sac. A striking\r\n     appearance was noted on exposure of the vein, the coats of\r\n     which vibrated visibly, quivering in exact consonance with the\r\n     palpable thrill. On tightening the silk ligature all pulsation\r\n     ceased in the aneurism, and the vibratory thrill in the vein\r\n     became much lessened.\r\n\r\n     The patient made a good recovery, only disturbed by a slight\r\n     attack of vomiting, and at the end of a week the wound had\r\n     healed, and pulsation in the aneurism had completely ceased.\r\n     The thrill persisted as before.\r\n\r\nSix months later, a small sac still exists beneath the sterno-mastoid.\r\nThe pulse still reaches 110-120 in pace. The purring thrill is very\r\nslight. The condition gives rise to little or no trouble. Pulsation is\r\nstrong in the external carotid artery, there is little in the common\r\ncarotid. The voice is strong and good. This aneurism is either at the\r\nbifurcation of the common carotid, or on the immediate commencement of\r\nthe internal carotid. Ligature of the external carotid will probably\r\ncure it.\r\n\r\n     (11) _Arterio-venous aneurism, probably affecting both\r\n     carotids._ Wounded at Paardeberg. _Entry_ (Mauser), at dimple\r\n     of chin immediately below mandibular symphysis. _Exit_, at\r\n     margin of right trapezius, the track crossing the carotids\r\n     about the level of normal bifurcation. The patient was lying on\r\n     his back with the head down when struck. Some haemorrhage from\r\n     the exit wound occurred at the time, and later on the way to\r\n     Jacobsdal this was so profuse as to be nearly fatal. A\r\n     considerable haemorrhage also occurred on the tenth day. The\r\n     patient made the journey to Modder River safely, and was then\r\n     under the charge of Mr. Cheatle. A large diffuse pulsating\r\n     swelling developed on the right side of the neck, with\r\n     well-marked thrill and machinery murmur. During the next three\r\n     weeks the swelling steadily contracted, and the patient was\r\n     sent down to the Base one month after receiving the wound, when\r\n     the condition was as follows. There is no evidence of any\r\n     fracture of the jaw. On the right side of the neck a large\r\n     aneurism fills the carotid triangle, extending from the\r\n     mid-line backwards to the margin of the trapezius, and from the\r\n     level of the top of the larynx upwards to the margin of the\r\n     mandible. The wall is fairly firm, pulsation is both visible\r\n     and palpable, and a well-marked thrill and machinery murmur are\r\n     present. The latter annoys him by its buzzing when the head\r\n     rests on the right side. The pupils are equal. Pulse somewhat\r\n     irritable, about 100. The voice is weak and husky, and there is\r\n     difficulty in swallowing solids. The actual swelling is\r\n     somewhat remarkable in outline, on the one hand following up\r\n     the course of the external carotid and facial arteries, and on\r\n     the other extending backwards in the line of the wound track\r\n     towards the exit. The patient was kept on his back with\r\n     sandbags around the head during the next fortnight. For the\r\n     first eight days such change as occurred was in the direction\r\n     of localisation and contraction, but during the last six,\r\n     evident extension occurred both backwards and downwards; this\r\n     extension was accompanied by severe pain in the cutaneous\r\n     cervical nerve area of the neck. The larynx became pushed over\r\n     3/4 of an inch to the left of the median line, and the\r\n     extension beneath the sterno-mastoid downwards raised a doubt\r\n     as to whether the common carotid could be exposed without\r\n     encroaching on the walls of the sac. Owing to indisposition I\r\n     had not been able to see the patient for some days, but now,\r\n     after consultation with Major Simpson and Mr. Watson, it was\r\n     decided that the best plan would be to expose and tie the\r\n     common carotid as high as could be safely done. The operation\r\n     was performed six weeks after the injury, and somewhat to our\r\n     surprise offered little difficulty. The carotid was exposed at\r\n     the upper border of the omo-hyoid, only a small amount of\r\n     infiltration having occurred in the vascular cleft. No\r\n     dilatation of the jugular was noticeable, and when a silk\r\n     ligature was applied to the artery all pulsation was\r\n     controlled, and the thrill in the vein disappeared completely.\r\n     The after progress was satisfactory, but four days later the\r\n     wound was dressed, as the patient's temperature had risen above\r\n     100 deg.. The tumour was consolidated: no pulsation could be felt,\r\n     but there was little apparent diminution in its size. A loud\r\n     blowing murmur was audible, especially at the posterior part of\r\n     the swelling.\r\n\r\n     On the morning of the fifth day the patient mentioned that he\r\n     again heard the whirr during the night. There had been no sign\r\n     of any cerebral disturbance and the pupils had remained equal\r\n     throughout.\r\n\r\n     A week after the operation the stitches were removed, there was\r\n     evidence of some blood clot in the lower part of the wound, and\r\n     this later liquefied and was let out on the eleventh day. At\r\n     that time a slight bubbling thrill could be felt at the upper\r\n     part of the tumour, also slight pulsation in the line of the\r\n     external carotid and at the most posterior part of the sac. The\r\n     latter was much contracted, diminished in size and apparently\r\n     solid, so that it was hoped that such pulsation as existed was\r\n     communicated. Ten months later, no trace of the aneurismal sac\r\n     exists. Neck normal, except for purring thrill. Voice strong\r\n     and good. Pulse 100. Following his usual work.\r\n\r\n     (12) _Carotid arterio-venous aneurism_.--Wounded at Paardeberg.\r\n     Aperture of _entry_ (Mauser), at the posterior border of the\r\n     left sterno-mastoid, 1 inch above the clavicle; _exit_, near\r\n     the posterior border of the right sterno-mastoid, 2 inches from\r\n     the sterno-clavicular joint. The injury was followed by very\r\n     free haemorrhage, mainly from the wound of entry, some 'quarts'\r\n     of blood escaping; at any rate his clothes were saturated. The\r\n     voice was hoarse and weak, and there was much difficulty in\r\n     swallowing; for the first twenty-four hours he could swallow\r\n     nothing, but gradual improvement took place. The patient was\r\n     carried two miles to the Field hospital, and three days later\r\n     travelled 36-40 miles in a bullock waggon to Modder River.\r\n     Thence he travelled to Orange River 55 miles by train on the\r\n     next day. A swelling was first noted when the wound was dressed\r\n     some seven days after the injury. No evidence was ever existent\r\n     of gross damage to either trachea or oesophagus beyond the\r\n     initial dysphagia. The hoarseness of voice due to left\r\n     laryngeal paralysis slowly improved, and was probably the\r\n     effect of concussion or contusion of the left recurrent\r\n     laryngeal nerve. During the patient's stay at Orange River a\r\n     large pulsating swelling with a strong thrill developed. This\r\n     was at first diffuse, but under the influence of rest it\r\n     steadily contracted and localised. During this period the\r\n     patient was seen several times by Mr. Cheatle, who noted\r\n     considerable temporary enlargement of the thyroid gland.\r\n\r\n     At the end of eight weeks he had been allowed up some days, and\r\n     travelled 570 miles to Wynberg. The aneurism was about 1-1/2\r\n     inch in diameter, smooth and rounded, extending just beneath\r\n     the left clavicle and nearly the whole width of the\r\n     sterno-mastoid, but well defined in all directions. There was\r\n     well-marked expansile pulsation, purring thrill along the\r\n     jugular vein and over the tumour, and loud machinery murmur\r\n     widely diffused along the whole neck and into the thorax. The\r\n     voice was still weak and husky, but there was no dysphagia or\r\n     dyspnoea. The left pupil was larger than the right.\r\n\r\n     The patient acquired enteric fever at Wynberg and when\r\n     convalescent was sent to Netley, whence he returned home. The\r\n     aneurism caused little discomfort. It may possibly have been of\r\n     the inferior thyroid artery.\r\n\r\n     (13) _Innominate arterio-venous varix_.--Wounded at Modder\r\n     River. _Entry_ (Mauser) posterior margin of left\r\n     sterno-mastoid, close above the clavicle. _Exit_ in anterior\r\n     axillary line one inch below the right anterior axillary fold.\r\n     Soon after the injury a considerable amount of blood was\r\n     coughed up, and occasional haemoptysis persisted for the next\r\n     four days. The patient was moved from the Field hospital by\r\n     train to Orange River, a journey of 55 miles and some four\r\n     hours' duration, on the fourth day. When examined there was\r\n     slight fulness over an area roughly circular and about 2-1/2\r\n     inches in extent, of which the sterno-clavicular joint lay just\r\n     within the centre. Over this area there was faint pulsation\r\n     with a strongly marked thrill and loud systolic bruit. The\r\n     radial pulses were even, the right pupil larger than the left.\r\n     No pain, and no dyspnoea. The right eye was partially closed,\r\n     but could be opened by the levator palpebrae superioris. The\r\n     patient was shortly afterwards sent to the Base, and when seen\r\n     there twenty-five days after the injury, there was little\r\n     change in the condition except that the fulness had\r\n     disappeared, the thrill was more marked, and a typical\r\n     machinery murmur transmitted along both carotid and subclavian\r\n     arteries had developed. There was no headache and the man\r\n     himself did not notice the bruit. Evidence of mediastinal\r\n     haemorrhage existed in the presence of subcutaneous\r\n     discoloration of the abdominal wall, below the ensiform\r\n     cartilage and extending slightly over the costal margin of the\r\n     thorax. In the absence of an aneurismal swelling, or of the\r\n     development of any further symptoms, the patient was sent home\r\n     to Netley in January.\r\n\r\nI saw this patient in Glasgow a year later. He was employed as a\r\nlamplighter, and was able to do his work well, only complaining of\r\nattacks of shortness of breath on exertion. He said these were apt to\r\ncome on each evening about 6 P.M. The pulse was 100 when the erect\r\nposition was maintained, and 84 to 88 in the sitting posture. The right\r\npupil was still dilated, reacting for accommodation but little to light.\r\nThe palpebral fissure was normal in size and there was little, if any,\r\ndiminution in strength of the right radial pulse.\r\n\r\nOn inspection no pulsation was visible; in fact, the pulsation of the\r\nnormal left subclavian was more apparent in the posterior triangle of\r\nthat side. The sterno-mastoid was prominent, also the sternal third of\r\nthe clavicle. On firm pressure some pulsation was palpable beneath the\r\nsterno-mastoid, but no definite evidence of the presence of a sac could\r\nbe detected. Purring thrill and machinery murmur were still present, but\r\nthe former was slight, and palpable only with the lightest pressure. The\r\nmachinery murmur had ceased to be audible to himself, and was by no\r\nmeans loud or very widely distributed.\r\n\r\nThe condition had, in fact, steadily improved, and become far less\r\nobvious. The prominence of the sterno-mastoid and clavicle still present\r\nwas difficult of explanation, except on the theory of an injury to the\r\nbone, or that an aneurismal sac had consolidated spontaneously.\r\n\r\n     (14) _Arterio-venous aneurism, root of right carotid._--Wounded\r\n     at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), centre of right\r\n     infra-spinous fossa. _Exit_, 3/4 of an inch above clavicle,\r\n     through point of junction of the heads of the right\r\n     sterno-mastoid muscle. Range 200-300 yards. When wounded the\r\n     man ran two hundred yards to seek cover. There was no serious\r\n     external haemorrhage, but the injury was followed by some\r\n     difficulty in swallowing, and haemoptysis, which lasted for the\r\n     first two days. The right radial pulse was noted to be smaller\r\n     than the left, and weakness in flexion of the fingers, with\r\n     hyperaesthesia in the ulnar nerve distribution, was observed.\r\n     The right pupil was also noted to be larger than the left.\r\n\r\n     The patient was sent down to the Base, and on the twenty-fourth\r\n     day the condition was as follows. A pulsating swelling existed\r\n     extending 1-1/4 inch upwards beneath the right sterno-mastoid,\r\n     from the mid line of the neck backwards to the centre of the\r\n     posterior triangle, and downwards over 2 inches of the first\r\n     intercostal space, which latter was dull on percussion. There\r\n     was some evidence of a bounding wall, but it was thin and the\r\n     tumour was soft and yielding. A loud machinery murmur was\r\n     audible over the tumour, over nearly the whole extent of the\r\n     thorax, and in the distal vessels as far as the temporal\r\n     upwards, and the brachial as far down as the bend of the elbow.\r\n     The murmur was audible to the patient with his ears closed.\r\n     Over the swelling a strong thrill was palpable; this extended\r\n     some little distance into the distal vessels and felt\r\n     remarkably superficial. It was particularly evident in the line\r\n     and course of the anterior jugular vein, and appeared to be\r\n     extinguished by local pressure. Although readily felt in the\r\n     posterior triangle, it was impalpable on deep pressure in the\r\n     suprasternal notch, a fact which seemed in favour of localising\r\n     the aneurismal varix to the subclavian artery and vein. The\r\n     right pulse was good, although smaller than the left, and was\r\n     said to have improved in volume. The right pupil was slightly\r\n     larger than the left, but reacted normally. There was no pain\r\n     or difficulty in swallowing. Weakness in power of flexion of\r\n     the fingers persisted, and there was some impairment of\r\n     sensation in the area of distribution of the ulnar nerve.\r\n\r\n     Three weeks later no material change had occurred, except that\r\n     the swelling was perhaps softer and the thrill more\r\n     superficial, and at the end of two months the patient was sent\r\n     to England.\r\n\r\nI saw this patient a year later in Glasgow, when the condition was as\r\nfollows. He was living at home, and out of employment. He complained of\r\nshortness of breath on exertion, and said that when he mounted stairs he\r\nfelt 'as if his heart were going to leave him.' The heart's apex beat in\r\nthe sixth interspace in the nipple line, and the precordial dulness was\r\nsomewhat increased. The pulse numbered 80 to 84. The muscles supplied by\r\nthe ulnar nerve were very weak, but not much wasted, and ulnar sensation\r\nwas imperfect.\r\n\r\nThe aneurism had considerably altered in form and outline; its walls\r\nwere dense and firm; it extended 2-1/2 inches upwards in the line of the\r\ncarotid artery, beneath the sterno-mastoid, but projected beyond the\r\nposterior border of that muscle. The larynx was displaced 1/2 an inch to\r\nthe left of the median line; the voice was still husky, although much\r\nstronger than it was; the anterior jugular vein was dilated. The purring\r\nthrill was very superficial, and chiefly palpable over the subclavian\r\nvessels. The machinery murmur was still loud, but much less widely\r\ndistributed than before; it was still audible to the patient when he lay\r\non his right side.\r\n\r\nThis case was of much interest from the diagnostic point of view. When I\r\nfirst saw the patient I considered the injury to have implicated the\r\ninnominate vessels. Later, from the facts that the thrill was\r\nimperceptible in the episternal notch, and that the main part of the\r\ntumour was situated in the posterior triangle, that the wound was of the\r\nroot of the right subclavian vessels.\r\n\r\nIt now appears that, at any rate, the root of the right carotid is the\r\nartery implicated.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the continued existence of a large aneurism, the\r\nlocalisation of the sac, which had taken place, was very striking,\r\nconsidering that the man had been walking about freely, and living an\r\nordinary life, except that he had undertaken no work.\r\n\r\n     (15) _Popliteal arterio-venous aneurism_.--Wounded at\r\n     Paardeberg. _Entry_ (Mauser), at lower margin of patella.\r\n     _Exit_, at centre of back of thigh. Perforation of lower end of\r\n     femur. The patient was lying down with crossed knees when the\r\n     injury was received. Much oedema of the foot and leg followed\r\n     the injury, and on the third day a thrill was discovered. Three\r\n     weeks later there was still some swelling of the calf, the\r\n     posterior tibial pulse was imperceptible, the anterior very\r\n     small. An aneurism was palpable at the inner part of the top of\r\n     the popliteal space, about the size of a pigeon's egg; a strong\r\n     thrill was to be felt, especially when the knee was flexed, and\r\n     with this expansile pulsation and a loud machinery murmur. The\r\n     entry wound was firmly healed; the exit still furnished\r\n     blood-stained serous discharge. The synovial cavity of the knee\r\n     was distended and doughy on palpation. During the next three\r\n     weeks the aneurism contracted considerably and the patient was\r\n     sent home.\r\n\r\n     When admitted to the Herbert Hospital the patient complained\r\n     chiefly of pains in the foot and leg. The aneurism was cured by\r\n     ligation of the vein above and below the communication and\r\n     proximal ligature of the popliteal artery.[15]\r\n\r\n     (16) '_Femoral arterio-venous aneurism._--A private of the West\r\n     Yorkshire Regiment was hit on February 11, 1900, at Monte\r\n     Christo by a bullet which passed through the inner border of\r\n     his right thigh above its middle. On arrival at Woolwich the\r\n     patient was found to have a varicose aneurism at the upper end\r\n     of Hunter's canal. On May 31 the femoral artery was ligatured\r\n     just above its communication with the vein, and as this stopped\r\n     all pulsation in the vein, it was decided to postpone ligature\r\n     of the latter to a subsequent occasion, if it should ever be\r\n     necessary; such a procedure would, it was thought, interfere\r\n     less with the circulation of the limb, and would therefore be\r\n     less likely to be followed by gangrene, which is so frequent a\r\n     result of high ligature of the femoral. But a few days after\r\n     the operation the foot became cold and mummified, and there\r\n     was no alternative but to amputate the limb through the\r\n     condyles of the femur. From this operation the patient made a\r\n     good recovery, and when discharged there was no sign of an\r\n     aneurism of the vein.'\r\n\r\nCase 16 is quoted from a paper in the _Lancet_ by Lieut.-Colonel Lewtas,\r\nI.M.S. It illustrates a result with which I became acquainted in three\r\nother instances not under my own observation.\r\n\r\n\r\nANEURISMAL VARICES\r\n\r\n     (17) _Axillary._--Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_ (Mauser), at\r\n     inner margin of front of left arm, just below level of junction\r\n     of axillary fold. _Exit_, at about centre of hollow of axilla.\r\n     A month later when the wound was healed a typical thrill and\r\n     machinery murmur were noticed. The latter was audible down to\r\n     the elbow and upwards into the neck. The radial pulse appeared\r\n     normal. No swelling or pulsation existed. At the end of three\r\n     months the condition was unaltered; the patient said he noticed\r\n     nothing abnormal in his arm, except that it was sometimes 'sort\r\n     of numb' at night.\r\n\r\n     (18) _Popliteal._--Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser),\r\n     in centre of popliteal space. _Exit_, about centre of patella,\r\n     which latter was cleanly perforated. Three weeks later the\r\n     typical thickening of the knee-joint following haemarthrosis was\r\n     present, also a well-marked thrill and machinery murmur in the\r\n     popliteal vessels with no evidence of a tumour. The leg was\r\n     normal except for slight enlargement of the internal saphenous\r\n     vein and its branches, probably independent of the arterial\r\n     lesion.\r\n\r\n     (19) _Femoral._--Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 7\r\n     inches below left anterior superior iliac spine. _Exit_, at\r\n     inner aspect of thigh. One month later slight fulness without\r\n     pulsation was discovered on the inner side of the femoral\r\n     vessels just above the level of the wound track. Some\r\n     blood-staining still remained in the fold between the scrotum\r\n     and thigh. Machinery murmur and a well-marked thrill, most\r\n     palpable to the inner side of the superficial femoral artery,\r\n     were noted. No further symptoms developed and the patient was\r\n     sent home.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis and treatment._--No one can help being struck with the\r\ndisinclination shown by the older surgeons to interference in cases of\r\neither aneurismal varix or varicose aneurism, even after the time that\r\nligation of the vessels had become a favourite and successful operation.\r\nThe objections lay in the technical difficulties of local treatment, and\r\nthe danger of gangrene after proximal ligature. Modern surgery has\r\nlightened the difficulties under which our predecessors approached these\r\noperations, but none the less the experience in this campaign fully\r\nsupports the objections to indiscriminate and ill-timed surgical\r\ninterference, as accidents have followed both direct local and proximal\r\nligature.\r\n\r\nIn _pure varix_ no doubt can exist as to the advisability of\r\nnon-interference in the early stage, in the absence of symptoms. This is\r\nthe more evident when we bear in mind that a stage in which an\r\naneurismal sac exists can seldom be absent. In many cases an expectant\r\nattitude may lead to the conviction that no interference is necessary,\r\nespecially in certain situations where the danger of gangrene has been\r\nfully demonstrated. In connection with this subject I cannot help\r\nrecalling the first case of femoral varix that ever came under my own\r\nobservation. I discovered the condition accidentally in a man admitted\r\ninto the hospital for other reasons. The patient remarked: 'For heaven's\r\nsake, sir, do not say anything about that. I have had it many years, and\r\nit has never given any trouble. If it is known, I shall be worried to\r\ndeath by people examining it.'\r\n\r\nNone the less it must be borne in mind that beyond enlargement of the\r\nvein dilatation of the artery above the seat of obstruction does occur,\r\nand gives trouble in some situations. Again the disturbance of the\r\ngeneral circulation already adverted to shows that the existence of this\r\ncondition is sometimes of importance in its influence on the cardiac\r\naction.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the treatment varies with regard to the\r\nvessels affected, and the degree of disturbance the condition gives rise\r\nto.\r\n\r\nWith regard to locality, experience appears to have shown clearly that\r\ncommunications between the carotid arteries and jugular veins usually\r\ngive rise to so little serious trouble that, in view of the grave nature\r\nof the operation and its possible after consequences on the brain,\r\ninterference is as a rule better avoided. I should, however, be\r\ninclined to draw a distinction between operations on the common and\r\ninternal carotid arteries in this particular, and should regard varix of\r\nthe latter vessel and the internal jugular vein as especially\r\nundesirable for interference.\r\n\r\nThe vessels at the root of the neck are probably to be regarded from the\r\nsame point of view, as to surgical interference.\r\n\r\nThe arteries of the upper extremity are the most suitable for operation,\r\nand the axillary may perhaps be the vessel in which interference is most\r\nlikely to be useful. In this relation it may be of interest to include\r\nhere a case of a man who took part in the campaign when already the\r\nsubject of an aneurismal varix of the axillary artery.\r\n\r\n     (20) Twenty years previously the patient suffered a punctured\r\n     wound of the left axilla from a pencil. A varix developed, but\r\n     was only discovered by accident ten years later. The patient\r\n     was seen by several surgeons, and treatment was discussed; the\r\n     balance of opinion was, however, in favour of non-interference,\r\n     and nothing was done beyond giving injunctions as to care in\r\n     the use of the limb. Up to the time of discovery of the varix\r\n     no inconvenience had been felt, although the patient was of\r\n     athletic habits. Subsequently, the patient himself was positive\r\n     that a swelling existed, but he pursued his usual work. In\r\n     1899-1900 he took part in the operations in South Africa as a\r\n     combatant, and during this time was subjected to very hard\r\n     manual work. During this he was seized with sudden pain in the\r\n     left side of the head and neck, and in consequence invalided.\r\n     No restriction in the movements of the upper extremity, and no\r\n     subcutaneous ecchymosis developed, but the patient was positive\r\n     as to the tumour having greatly enlarged.\r\n\r\n     Four months later the condition was little altered. A pulsating\r\n     swelling 1-1/2 inch broad existed along the line of the upper\r\n     two-thirds of the axillary artery, and along the subclavian in\r\n     the neck, rising some 1-1/2 inch into the posterior triangle.\r\n     Pulsation was visible; the murmur was audible when sitting\r\n     beside the patient, and widely distributed over the whole\r\n     chest, the neck, and upper extremity on auscultation. The pulse\r\n     rate varied with the mental condition of the patient, which was\r\n     excitable, between 96 and 120. There was neuralgic pain in the\r\n     neck and scalp, and down the distribution of the brachial\r\n     plexus. The pupils were equal, but flushing of the face and\r\n     profuse sweating followed any exertion. I concluded the tumour\r\n     in this case to be mainly due to dilatation of the trunk above\r\n     the point of obstruction on account of its outline, the absence\r\n     of any restriction of movement in the upper extremity, and the\r\n     non-occurrence of subcutaneous ecchymosis at the time of the\r\n     attack of severe pain. Difficulties arose as to undertaking any\r\n     active form of treatment for this patient, which, to be\r\n     satisfactory, needed an antecedent period of absolute rest, and\r\n     he passed from my observation. I think, however, operation by\r\n     ligature above and below the communication would have been\r\n     possible. The case affords a good example of the course the\r\n     condition may sometimes take if precaution is neglected.\r\n\r\nThe vessels of the arm or forearm may in almost all cases be interfered\r\nwith, but in many instances an absence of any serious symptom renders\r\noperation unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the femoral varices, I would refer to the remarks below,\r\nand those on the treatment of varicose aneurism as indicating that a\r\ncertain amount of caution should be exercised in interfering with them.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks in a lesser degree apply to the popliteal vessels. In\r\nthe leg the tibials may readily and safely be attacked, but it may be\r\nmentioned that the widespread and diffused nature of the thrill may in\r\nsome cases give rise to considerable difficulty in sharp localisation of\r\nthe varix to either of the vessels, or to any particular spot in their\r\ncourse. In one case in my experience the posterior tibial was cut down\r\nupon, when the varix was probably peroneal in situation.\r\n\r\nThe operation most in favour consists in ligation of the artery above\r\nand below the varix, the vein remaining untouched. Even this operation,\r\nhowever, in two cases of femoral varix failed to effect more than a\r\ntemporary cessation of the symptoms, although the ligatures were placed\r\nbut a short distance from the communication. Failure is due to the\r\npresence of collateral branches, which are not easy of detection. Even\r\nwhen the vessels lie exposed, the even distribution of the thrill\r\nrenders determination of the exact point of communication difficult, and\r\nthe difficulty is augmented by the temporary arrest of the thrill\r\nfollowing the application of a proximal ligature to the artery. A\r\nsuccessful case is reported by Deputy Inspector-General H. T. Cox, R.N.,\r\nin which the ligatures were placed 1/2 an inch from the point of\r\ncommunication.[16] Single ligation, or proximal ligature, is useless.\r\n\r\nIf the vein cannot be spared, excision of a limited part of both vessels\r\nmay be preferable, particularly in those of the upper extremity.\r\n\r\nProximal ligation of the artery combined with double ligature of the\r\nvein, as adopted in case 15 by Colonel Lewtas for a varicose aneurism,\r\nmight offer advantages in some situations.\r\n\r\nGiven suitable surroundings and certain diagnosis, the ideal treatment\r\nof this condition, as of the next, is preventive--_i.e._ primary\r\nligation of the wounded artery. Many difficulties, however, lie in the\r\nway of this beyond mere unsatisfactory surroundings. It suffices to\r\nmention the two chief: uncertainty as to the vessel wounded, and the\r\nnecessity of always ligaturing the vein as well as the artery in a limb\r\noften more or less dissected up by extravasated blood, to show that this\r\nwill never be resorted to as routine treatment.\r\n\r\n_Arterio-venous aneurism._--Many of the remarks in the last section find\r\nequal application here, but in the presence of an aneurismal sac\r\nnon-intervention is rarely possible or advisable. In the early stages\r\nthe proper treatment in any case consists in placing the patient in as\r\ncomplete a condition of rest as possible, and affording local support to\r\nthe limb by a splint, preferably a removable plaster-of-Paris case.\r\nShould no further extension, or, what is more likely, should contraction\r\nand diminution occur, it will be well to continue this treatment for\r\nsome weeks at least.\r\n\r\nWhen the aneurism has reached a quiescent stage the question of further\r\ntreatment arises, and whether this should consist in local interference\r\nor proximal ligature. The answer to this mainly depends on the size and\r\nsituation of the vessels concerned. To take of the cases above described\r\nthe five instances in which the cervical vessels were the seat of the\r\naneurism. In No. 13 the symptoms appeared fairly conclusive of the\r\ninjury being to the innominate artery and vein, or possibly innominate\r\nartery and jugular vein. Fortunately the aneurismal sac in this case was\r\nsmall and showed a tendency to decrease, but in any case no interference\r\nwould have been justifiable. I think a similar opinion was unavoidable\r\nin No. 14, probably affecting the root of the right carotid. Here under\r\nany circumstances interference would have been most hazardous. The\r\nposition of large aneurism made the route of approach to the wounded\r\nspot necessarily through the sac, exposing the patient to the double\r\ndanger of immediate haemorrhage and of entrance of air into the great\r\nveins. Nos. 10, 11, and 12 fall into the same category, except that in\r\nNo. 11 the immediate indication for interference was extension. In each,\r\nligature of the artery above and below the point of communication would\r\nhave necessitated so near an approach to the sac which must remain in\r\ncommunication with the vein as to have entailed injury to the latter,\r\nwhen both artery and vein must have been ligatured, probably risking\r\nserious cerebral trouble. In No. 11 I believe both the external and\r\ninternal carotids were implicated; in No. 10 I believe the internal\r\nalone, close to its origin. The operation of proximal ligature ensured\r\nprimary consolidation of the sac in both cases 10 and 11, but left the\r\nthrill unaltered, except in so far as it was temporarily weakened. It,\r\nin fact, converted these cases from arterio-venous aneurisms into pure\r\naneurismal varices. In No. 10 a sac subsequently redeveloped. No. 12\r\nstood on a different basis. No operation was done for him in South\r\nAfrica, but the first portion of the carotid might have been ligatured\r\nin the episternal notch, or by aid of removal of a part of the sternum,\r\nand a second ligature placed above the sac. Here a ligature above and\r\nbelow the communication would have been comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule proximal ligature is to be reserved for those cases\r\nalone in which double ligature is either impracticable or inadvisable,\r\nand it can only be expected to convert a varicose aneurism into the less\r\ndangerous condition of aneurismal varix.\r\n\r\nIn the case of arterio-venous aneurisms in the limbs the possibilities\r\nof treatment are enlarged, and here the alternatives of (_a_) local\r\ninterference with the sac and direct ligature of the wounded point,\r\n(_b_) simple ligature above and below the sac, (_c_) proximal ligature\r\n(Hunterian operation), come into consideration.\r\n\r\nDirect incision of the sac is suitable, and the best method of treatment\r\nfor aneurisms in the calf, forearm, and probably arm. Several cases in\r\nthe two former situations were successfully treated by this method. On\r\nthe other hand, the only case I saw in which a proximal ligature had\r\nbeen applied for an arterio-venous aneurism of the leg resulted most\r\nunsatisfactorily. The sac in the calf suppurated at a later date, and\r\nfor many weeks the escape of small quantities of blood from the\r\nremaining sinus kept up the fear of a severe attack of secondary\r\nhaemorrhage until the sinus closed.\r\n\r\nIn the case of femoral and popliteal aneurisms the method of Antyllus is\r\noften unsuitable. A case of arterio-venous aneurism of the femoral\r\nartery quoted in the _Lancet_[17] will illustrate the difficulty which\r\nmay be met with in determining the actual bleeding point in the\r\nirregular cavity laid open. In any case the necessary ligature of both\r\nartery and vein is a serious objection to the direct method either in\r\nthe thigh or ham, and more particularly if adopted before the damage\r\ndependent on the dissection of the limb by extravasated blood has been\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\nProximal ligature (Hunterian) even, offers dangers under these\r\ncircumstances. In one case with which I became acquainted, it was\r\nfollowed by gangrene, necessitating amputation. The lesion in this\r\ninstance was a perforating one of the femoral artery and vein.\r\n\r\nFor either femoral or popliteal arterio-venous aneurisms ligature of the\r\nartery above and below the aneurism is the best and safest treatment. In\r\nview of the healthy state of the vascular wall in most of these cases,\r\nthe advantage of placing the ligatures as near to the wounded spot as\r\ncan be managed without interference with the sac is afforded. A number\r\nof popliteal cases treated in this way did perfectly. In the femoral\r\ncases a considerable period of rest to allow of consolidation of the\r\nsac, and readjustment of the circulation, should always be allowed to\r\nelapse.\r\n\r\nIn the case of popliteal arterio-venous aneurisms a number were\r\nsuccessfully treated by proximal (Hunterian) ligature, and by single\r\nligature immediately above the sac. In a considerable proportion of the\r\nlatter both artery and vein were tied. This was apparently the result of\r\nthe difficulty of isolating the vessels in the tangled mass of clot and\r\ncicatricial tissue surrounding them, and is a strong argument against\r\ntoo early interference. The late Sir William Stokes expressed himself as\r\nin favour of ligature of the artery in Hunter's canal, combined with\r\nthat of the great anastomotic branch, and quoted some successful cases\r\nto me. I have grave doubts, however, whether the varix can often be\r\npermanently cured by this operation.\r\n\r\nI can give no useful statistics on this subject, but with regard to the\r\npopliteal aneurisms I may state that in three instances gangrene of the\r\nleg followed early operative interference in the popliteal space.\r\n\r\nMy own opinion on this subject is strong, and to the effect that none of\r\nthese operations should be undertaken before a period of from two to\r\nthree months after the injury, unless there is evidence of progressive\r\nenlargement. In every case which came under my own observation\r\nprogressive contraction and consolidation took place up to a certain\r\npoint under the influence of rest. When this process has become\r\nstationary, and the surrounding tissues have regained to a great extent\r\ntheir normal condition, the operations are far easier, and beyond this\r\nmore likely to be followed by success.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that one argument only can be raised against the above\r\nopinion, viz. the possibility of healing of the recent wound in the\r\nvessels when the force of the circulation is lowered by proximal\r\nligature. Such experience as that quoted from Sir W. Stokes and two of\r\nMr. Ker's cases, mentioned below, support this possibility, but in all\r\nthe reported results were recent. Against them I can only advance my\r\nknowledge of several mishaps following early operation.\r\n\r\nIn concluding these observations on injuries to the arteries and\r\naneurisms, a few general remarks as to the occurrence of gangrene after\r\noperation must be added. This was not uncommon, and in the main was no\r\ndoubt attributable--(1) to the lowering of the vitality of the\r\nsurrounding tissues by creeping blood extravasation, and sometimes to\r\nactual pressure by the extravasation on the vessels necessary for the\r\nestablishment of the collateral circulation. (2) To the frequency with\r\nwhich both artery and vein required to be ligatured.\r\n\r\nBeyond these common causes, however, others must be advanced, dependent\r\non the general and local condition of the nervous system in these cases.\r\nIn general mental state many of the patients were much shaken, and in\r\nothers the condition spoken of as local shock in a former chapter had\r\nbeen marked. In a third series obvious individual nerve lesions were\r\nco-existent with those to the vessels. Beyond this a fourth nervous\r\nelement of unknown quantity, the effect of the form of injury on the\r\nvaso-motor nerves accompanying the great vessels, must be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nI believe all these factors were of importance, since it appeared to me\r\nthat gangrene occurred more often than I should have expected. In one\r\ncase which I have heard of, gangrene followed a very slight injury to\r\nthe foot in a patient who had apparently made an excellent recovery\r\nafter ligature of the femoral artery.\r\n\r\nThe nervous factor seems another element in favour of reasonable delay\r\nin active interference with traumatic aneurisms of the above varieties\r\nin the absence of threatening symptoms.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that no case of gangrene due to aneurism came\r\nunder my notice, except subsequently to operation.\r\n\r\nSince the above chapter was written, my friend, Mr. J. E. Ker, has sent\r\nme his experience in the treatment of four aneurisms, which is of such\r\ninterest that I insert it as an addendum.\r\n\r\n_Arterial haematomata._--(1) Popliteal, treated by local incision. Both\r\nartery and vein completely divided. Ligature of the four ends. Cure.\r\n(2) Traumatic aneurism of upper third of forearm. Treated by rest and\r\npressure by bandage. On the eighth day pulsation and bruit ceased\r\nspontaneously, and the remains of the sac steadily consolidated until\r\nthe man's discharge on the twenty-sixth day.\r\n\r\n_Arterio-venous aneurisms._--(1) At junction of brachial and axillary\r\narteries. Proximal ligature. Cure. (2) Arterio-venous aneurism at the\r\nbend of the elbow. Ligature of the brachial at the junction of the\r\nmiddle and lower thirds of the arm. Cure.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] The murmur is still present at the expiration of one year, but no\r\nother change.\r\n\r\n[15] Lieut.-Colonel Lewtas, I.M.S.

I shall hope to\r\nshow, however, as in some of the other injuries, that these features\r\ndiffered only in degree from those exhibited by injuries from the old\r\nleaden bullets of larger calibre, although with few exceptions they were\r\nof a distinctly more favourable character.\r\n\r\nIt is of considerable interest to note that, taking the fractures as a\r\nwhole, there was a somewhat striking change in their nature during the\r\nearlier and later portions of the campaign. In the earlier stages I\r\nthink there is no doubt that punctured fractures were proportionately\r\nmore common than in the later, when comminuted fractures were much more\r\noften seen. There was, I believe, a source of error in this opinion, as\r\nfar as I myself was concerned, in that the first cases I saw were at\r\nCapetown and had come from Natal. There is no doubt that the punctured\r\nfractures were earlier fit to travel, and hence a larger number of them\r\nfound their way to the Base hospitals at a period when the comminuted\r\nfractures were still in the Field or Stationary hospitals. I do not,\r\nhowever, rely on the cases seen at Capetown alone for my opinion, as\r\nwhile at the front I saw the same large proportion of clean punctures in\r\nthe early engagements of the Kimberley relief force.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to attribute the change to two reasons: first, I believe\r\nthat the use of regulation weapons was more universal in the earlier\r\npart of the war, while later, as more men were engaged, the\r\nMartini-Henry came more into evidence, and the Boers took more freely\r\nto the use of sporting rifles and ammunition. Another element also in\r\nthe less clean punctures of the short and cancellous bones was probably\r\nthe less accurate and hard shooting of the Mauser rifles as they became\r\nworn; the bullets seemed to evidence this by the comparative shallowness\r\nof their rifle grooves, which, I take it, would mean less velocity and\r\naccuracy in flight. This would be of importance, since the clean\r\npuncture of cancellous bone was no doubt favoured by a high rate of\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\nThe special features of the fractures caused by the small-calibre\r\nbullets were: (1) The nature of the exit wound, which in a certain\r\nproportion of the cases exhibited the so-called 'explosive' character.\r\n(2) The presence, in a marked degree in the severe cases, of the\r\ncondition spoken of in Chapter III. as 'local shock.' (3) The striking\r\ncontrast of clean perforation and extreme comminution in different\r\ncases. (4) The occasional occurrence of fractures of a very high degree\r\nof longitudinal obliquity. (5) The rarity of any that could be termed\r\ntransverse fractures. (6) The general tendency of longitudinal fissuring\r\nwhen it occurred to stop short of the articular extremities of the\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be most convenient to consider first the explanation of\r\nthe development of the so-called explosive apertures, and then to pass\r\non to a general consideration of the types of fracture commonly met\r\nwith, before proceeding to the description of the injuries to the\r\nseparate bones.\r\n\r\n_Explosive wounds in connection with fractures._--The aperture of entry\r\nin these injuries presented little or no deviation from the normal,\r\nunless it was due to the passage of ricochet bullets, when it might be\r\nvery irregular, but usually not of great size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47--(21) 'Explosive' Exit Wound of Forearm over\r\nmargin of ulna. Note creased tongue of skin originally covering whole\r\nwound. The entry wound was a small typical circular one]\r\n\r\nThe aperture of exit offered special features beyond simple increase in\r\nsize. First of all, as in the small type wounds, the actual extent of\r\ndestruction of the skin was small, this having been projected outwards\r\nby the passing bullet and then either burst or torn by the bullet and\r\naccompanying bony fragments. Fig. 47 well illustrates this feature. A\r\ntriangular tongue of skin was lifted by the passing bullet and probably\r\nby the lower end of the upper fragment of the fractured ulna; through\r\nthe resulting opening a mass of soft tissues and bone fragments, bound\r\ntogether by an infiltration of coagulated blood, was extruded,\r\nseparating the lateral lips of the aperture, while the original tongue\r\nhas shortened and retracted up to the top of the wound.\r\n\r\nThe small extent of skin actually destroyed is an important element in\r\nthe rapid contraction often seen in these wounds when they progress\r\nfavourably. Thus the large wound portrayed in fig. 48 contracted to\r\none-fourth its original size ten days after the diagram and measurements\r\nwere made. The large mass of protruded tissue was often most striking\r\nwhen a muscle such as the biceps in fig. 48 had been divided; but the\r\nherniae were more persistent when the mass projected in regions where\r\ntendons formed a large integral constituent, as at the wrist or lower\r\nthird of the forearm. The protruding tissues naturally consisted of many\r\nvarieties, according to what lay in the track of any particular wound.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that for 'explosive' features to reach their\r\nstrongest development, it is necessary that the bone affected should lie\r\nnear the surface of the body; hence the most characteristic explosive\r\nwounds were met with in the forearm or leg, over the metacarpus or\r\nmetatarsus, or in the arm. In the thigh, on the other hand, where the\r\nfemur in a great part of its course not only lies deeply, but is also\r\nprotected by particularly strong and resistent skin and fascia, another\r\ntype of wound was met with. The explosive exit aperture, although large,\r\nwas still only moderate in extent, sometimes, as in the front of the\r\nlower third, exposing a somewhat angular large track walled by the\r\ndivided quadriceps extensor cruris. In other cases, on introducing the\r\nfinger through a moderate exit opening on the inner aspect of the thigh,\r\na large cavity, sometimes 4 or 5 inches in diameter, was discovered,\r\nfull of clot and shreds of destroyed tissue and lined by a layer of\r\nsimilar material. In either of these latter cases the fractured bone\r\nends were situated too deeply to take part in the actual laceration of\r\nthe skin, while the force transmitted to the bone fragments, although\r\nsufficient to cause them to widely destroy the first soft tissues met\r\nwith, did not suffice to cause them to burst or lacerate the skin\r\nwidely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--(22) 'Explosive' Exit Wound of front of Arm.\r\nWound actual size eight days after its infliction. The prominences in\r\nthe upper and lower parts correspond with the lacerated biceps. The dark\r\ncrater led down to the fracture. In another week the wound had\r\ncontracted to half the size. The entry aperture was a normal circular\r\none. The arm a year later was used in the patient's employment as a\r\nhammer-man.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the theories of the production of these phenomena, that\r\nof the transmission of a part of the force of the bullet to the\r\ncomminuted fragments, which thus themselves acquire the characters of\r\nsecondary projectiles, seems quite adequate.[18] Examination of any of\r\nthe skiagrams in which considerable comminution has taken place, shows\r\nthat the fragments are carried forward and perforate the tissues distal\r\nto the fracture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--'Explosive' Wounds of Legs. Large irregular\r\nentry (1 x 3/4 in.). First exit (2 in.) roughly circular. Second entry\r\nwound, produced by bone fragments driven out of left leg, very large and\r\nirregular (5 x 3-1/2 in.). The measurements were taken eight days after\r\ninfliction of the wounds. The right limb was amputated later for\r\nsecondary haemorrhage]\r\n\r\nFig. 49, although a poor delineation of the actual condition, shows well\r\nthe possible action of projected fragments, even after they have been\r\ndriven from the wound. In this case either a large or a ricochet bullet\r\nentered on the outer aspect of the upper third of the left tibia; it\r\nproduced a severe comminuted fracture, the fragments from which,\r\ntogether with the deformed bullet, then struck and perforated the upper\r\nthird of the right tibia. A large irregular entry wound 5 inches in\r\ntransverse diameter was produced in the second limb together with a\r\ncomminuted fracture of the bone. The right limb had eventually to be\r\namputated for secondary haemorrhage, but I am unacquainted with the later\r\nhistory of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe mode of displacement of the lateral fragments when a wide shaft such\r\nas that of the femur is struck, throws some light on that of the\r\ndisplacement of soft tissues such as the component parts of a perforated\r\nnerve or artery. The bullet, passing through, expends the chief part of\r\nits energy in driving before it the fragments produced in its direct\r\ncourse, while a minor part of the energy is expended on displacing the\r\nlateral fragments, which are pushed to either side without becoming\r\nseparated from their periosteal attachment. The appearance, in fact,\r\nsomewhat suggests what might be expected were a small charge of dynamite\r\nintroduced into the centre of a small tunnel made across the shaft of\r\nthe bone. Examination of some of the skiagrams also illustrates another\r\npoint of interest, viz. that a certain degree of recoil on the part of\r\nthe bone results from the blow, since in many of them portions of the\r\nmantle of the bullet and bone fragments are seen in that portion of the\r\ntrack proximal to the fractured bone.\r\n\r\nThe importance of 'setting up' of the bullet is at once evident in\r\nrelation to the production of wounds of an explosive type in connection\r\nwith fractures of the bones. There can be no doubt that a considerable\r\nnumber of the most severe injuries we saw were produced by the various\r\nsoft-nosed or expanding forms of bullet, also that others of an equally\r\nserious nature were produced by Martini-Henry or large leaden sporting\r\nbullets. Allowing for this, however, I think a considerable proportion\r\nwere the result of deformation from bony impact, or ricochet deformities\r\nexternal to the body acquired by regulation Mauser bullets, and I think\r\nthese bullets can be quite as formidable as any of the sporting\r\nvarieties met with. The soft-nose varieties of small calibre may not set\r\nup enough to cause severe injury, while the large leaden bullets often\r\nflatten out so completely as to lose all penetrating power. As far as\r\nmy impressions went, the small soft-nosed bullets needed to be\r\ntravelling at a very considerable rate of velocity to be dangerous. In\r\nthe form of soft-nose Mauser employed, the soft-nose was too short to\r\nallow of as successful a mushrooming of the bullet as often occurred\r\nwith the regulation projectile, because, as already explained, the\r\nmantle acquires increased stability from its closed base.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE SHAFTS OF THE LONG BONES\r\n\r\n_Types of fracture._--The common types of fracture of shafts of the long\r\nbones are illustrated diagrammatically in fig. 50. Of the whole series\r\ncomminuted fractures were by far the most frequently met with, while the\r\nvarious wedge-shaped forms were the most strongly characteristic of the\r\nspecial form of injury in which we are interested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Five Types of Fracture: A. Primary lines of\r\nstellate fracture; wedges driven out laterally and pointed extremities\r\nleft to main fragments. B. Development of same lines by a bullet\r\ntravelling at a low degree of velocity; suppression of two left-hand\r\nlimbs and substitution of a transverse line of fracture; a spurious form\r\nof perforation. See plate XXIII. C. Typical complete wedge. See plate\r\nVII. D. Incomplete wedge; impact of bullet, lateral or oblique, and two\r\nleft-hand lines seen in A are suppressed. E. Oblique single line, one\r\nright and one left hand line seen in A, suppressed. The influence of\r\nleverage from weight of the body probably acts here. Compare plates XVI.\r\nand XXI.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson Ltd.\r\n\r\n(23) SPURIOUS PERFORATION OF CLAVICLE\r\n\r\nRange unknown, probably either mean or long.\r\n\r\nThe bullet entered from the front, grooved the under surface of the\r\nacromial end of the clavicle with increasing depth, and eventually\r\nperforated the posterior margin of the bone, raising the compact tissue\r\nin an angular manner.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of an incomplete groove extending from the anterior\r\nmargin is seen, resembling the groove of the humerus, fig. 58.]\r\n\r\n1. _Stellate comminuted fractures._--A shows the primary nature of the\r\nlesion in all comminuted fractures of compact bone, consisting in the\r\nproduction of a number of radiating fissures, which assume a stellate\r\nform of which the point of impact corresponds to the centre. B shows an\r\nincomplete development of this form, the fragments being simply\r\ndisplaced laterally with slight loss of substance, so as to simulate a\r\nreal punctured fracture. An illustration of this fracture produced by a\r\nbullet travelling at a low degree of velocity is seen in plate XXIII.,\r\nwhich also shows the unaltered bullet lying in close proximity to the\r\ninjured fibula.\r\n\r\nThe degree of comminution in these fractures depends first on the range\r\nof fire and consequent striking force retained by the bullet, a high\r\ndegree of velocity producing extreme comminution of compact bone. The\r\nseverity of the latter again may be influenced by the measure of\r\nresistance dependent on the density and brittleness of any individual\r\nbone, or on the possession of the same characters as a special property\r\nby the tissues of the man struck. Thus plate IV. shows a fracture of the\r\nhumerus produced by a bullet shot from a short range, and the fragments\r\nare comparatively large and of even dimensions, while plate XIV. shows\r\nextreme comminution of the portion of the femur exposed to direct\r\nimpact, with elongated large fragments at the sides of the track. Plate\r\nXIX. shows less extreme comminution and less separation of the\r\nfragments, and was probably produced by a bullet from a longer range of\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe separation of elongated lateral fragments is a special feature, and\r\nbest marked when the portion of bone struck is considerably wider than\r\nthe bullet, as in the case of the shaft of the femur. These fragments\r\ncorrespond in the method of their production to those seen in the wedge\r\nfractures described below, while their separation leaves a pointed\r\nextremity to either segment of the shaft. This fracture in its purest\r\ntype is, I believe, spoken of as the 'butterfly fracture.'\r\n\r\nWith regard to the spread of the fissures in the long axis of the bone\r\ninto neighbouring articulations I think fractures produced by bullets of\r\nsmall calibre differ considerably from those produced by larger\r\nprojectiles, in that their general tendency is not to extend beyond the\r\ncommencement of the cancellous bone forming the joint end. This is\r\nperhaps capable of explanation on several grounds: first, the smaller\r\narea of impact results in the assumption of a strongly marked stellate\r\nfigure, the radiating fissures of which rapidly reach the lateral limits\r\nof the shaft, producing a solution of continuity in the bone which\r\ninterrupts the continuance of the action of the wedge represented by the\r\nbullet. Secondly, the small size of the wedge itself is opposed to the\r\nwide separation of the parts directly implicated, which is necessary for\r\nthe continued progress of the process of fissuring, and again the\r\nrapidity of passage minimises the period during which the force is\r\nexerted. It is in these points that I believe the chief differences\r\nbetween the modern and old gunshot fractures find their explanation,\r\nsince with the larger bullets fractures extending from some distance\r\ninto the joints were a somewhat special feature. In addition it is\r\nprobable that the alteration in structure at the junction of the shafts\r\nwith the cancellous ends also tends to check the regular extension of\r\nthe fissures, as a similar limitation is illustrated even in some\r\nfractures by Snider bullets. Fig. 51 of the lower end of the femur\r\nillustrates a not uncommon lower limit to a comminuted injury in this\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Lower end of Femur. From Case needing\r\namputation. It shows the usual tendency of the fissures to stop short of\r\nthe articular ends of the long bones]\r\n\r\nThe degree and nature of the comminution also vary with the directness\r\nof impact on the part of the bullet. The more nearly this approaches at\r\na right angle, the more severe is the local comminution, but probably a\r\nlesser area of the shaft is implicated. Plate V. shows an example of\r\nthis: all trace of continuity is lost, a wide gap separates the bone\r\nends, while the fragments themselves have been for the most part driven\r\naltogether out of the wound. Oblique impact, on the other hand, may\r\nwiden the comminuted area at the point of impact, while, if the bullet\r\nretains sufficient force and regularity of outline, it may then travel\r\n'cutting its way' through the remainder of the bone in an oblique\r\ndirection. It will be of course recognised that the exact impact of the\r\nbullet depends not alone on the direction of the projectile, but also\r\non the nature of the slope offered by the surface of bone struck.\r\n\r\n2. _Wedge fractures._--This form (C and D, fig. 50) is equally\r\ncharacteristic of gunshot injury with pure perforation; it is met with\r\nin two varieties. C illustrates the more strongly marked type; in it the\r\nbullet makes passing lateral impact with the shaft, and from the point\r\nstruck radiating fissures extend to the opposite margin, so that a\r\nwedge-shaped piece of bone often secondarily comminuted is separated\r\nfrom the remainder of the shaft; see plate X. of the radius.\r\n\r\nThe second variety, D, is an incomplete development of the stellate\r\nfracture in which the fissures pass to one margin of the bone only. The\r\nexplanation of this variation is probably to be sought in the direction\r\nof impact on the part of the bullet, since the main fissure is often\r\naccompanied by secondary lines which run a somewhat parallel course to\r\nthe main one, and suggest the dispersion of the force in the form of\r\nconcentric waves. Such fractures were most strongly marked in the tibia,\r\nthe breadth of the surfaces of this bone presenting especially\r\nfavourable conditions for their production.\r\n\r\n3. _Notched fractures._--These may be a slight degree of the form of\r\nwedge fracture last described; such a one is depicted in plate XXII.\r\nwhere a portion of the spine of the tibia has been carried away by a\r\npassing bullet. Other notched fractures approximate themselves more\r\nnearly to perforations, the notch being a groove secondary to the\r\nopening up of such a track as is shown in the illustration of a\r\nperforation of the lower third of the shaft of the tibia (fig. 57 on p.\r\n219). Notching or grooving is naturally much more common in the\r\ncancellous portions of bones.\r\n\r\n4. _Oblique fractures._--These also occur in two varieties: the first\r\nhas been already alluded to; in it the bullet actually cuts an oblique\r\ntrack in the bone; the main line of fracture is often considerably\r\ncomminuted, usually at the proximal end of the track (see plates XV. and\r\nXIX.).\r\n\r\nThe second variety (E, fig. 50) is less common; in it two of the main\r\nlimbs of the simple stellate figure are suppressed, while the remaining\r\ntwo form a continuous line from one margin of the shaft to the other,\r\nthe point of impact lying approximately in the centre of the line of\r\nfracture. Such a fracture is illustrated by the skiagram of a femur in\r\nplate XVI. in which the bullet traversed the soft parts transversely at\r\nthe level of the centre of the fracture, which was 9 inches in length.\r\nIn another case the line of fracture occupied the lower third of the\r\nfemur, passing from the inner border of the shaft, the lower end of the\r\nupper fragment was formed by the compact tissue forming the outer wall\r\nof the external condyle. This latter perforated the vastus externus and\r\nlay beneath the skin; as it could not be disentangled, an incision was\r\nmade over it, and the fragments when reduced were screwed together by\r\nMr. S. W. F. Richardson. In neither fracture was there any comminution.\r\nSuch fractures most nearly resemble the oblique or spiral ones met with\r\nin civil practice as the results of falls. In all the instances I\r\nobserved the patients were supported on the lower extremities at the\r\ntime of the accident, and one can only assume that a twist of the trunk\r\nconsequent on the fall of the body diverts the most forcible vibrations\r\nresulting from the impact of the bullet into one line, and thus produces\r\na solution of continuity of a simple oblique nature. In both the cases\r\nmentioned above the bullet was probably travelling at a low degree of\r\nvelocity; in the first it was a ricochet and was retained. I never saw\r\none of these fractures in the upper extremity.\r\n\r\nPlate XXI. affords an excellent example of this mechanism. The patient\r\nwas standing when struck, and then fell backwards. An incomplete fissure\r\n7 inches in length is seen to extend from an otherwise pure perforation\r\nof the shaft of the tibia.\r\n\r\n5. _Transverse fractures._--Throughout these were of very rare\r\noccurrence. Plate XX. illustrates a pure transverse fracture produced by\r\npassing contact of a bullet probably fired at a distance not exceeding\r\n400 yards, and which subsequently struck the fibula plumb and produced\r\nconsiderable comminution. No fissure extended into the ankle-joint.\r\nComminutions such as that illustrated by plate V. more or less simulated\r\ntransverse fractures, but I saw no examples of transverse tracks\r\ncomparable to the oblique ones described above 'cut through' the shaft\r\nof a bone.\r\n\r\n6. _Perforations._--Although these were common in cancellous bone, they\r\nwere comparatively rare in the compact shafts. I saw, however, complete\r\npure perforations of the shafts of the tibia, femur, clavicle, and other\r\nbones. These perforations were, I believe, always the result of low\r\ndegrees of velocity, and they took the place of simple transverse\r\nfractures of the 'cut' variety. The apertures of entry and exit in the\r\nbones resembled in character those seen in the soft parts, or in the\r\nbones of the skull in low-velocity injuries (see figs. 71 and 72, p.\r\n261). The entry was more or less cleanly cut, while at the exit a plate\r\nof bone was raised, and either separated or turned back on a hinge by\r\nthe bullet (fig. 52), (plate XVII.) Such a projecting hinged fragment\r\nwas sometimes a source of some trouble; thus in a case of\r\npostero-anterior perforation of the lower third of the shaft of the\r\nfemur, the long exit fragment projected into the substance of the\r\nquadriceps extensor muscle, and interfered with flexion of the\r\nknee-joint. Fig. 57 of a superficial tunnel of the lower third of the\r\ntibia is especially interesting as bringing such injuries of the long\r\nbones into line with fractures of the flat bones of the skull, such as\r\nare illustrated in fig. 68, p. 259.\r\n\r\nPlate XXI. affords an excellent example of perforation of the shaft of\r\nthe tibia, although complicated by the secondary fissure.\r\n\r\nPlates XXIII., VIII., and III., of the fibula, humerus, and clavicle,\r\nexhibit examples of what may be called spurious perforations of the\r\nshafts of bones, since comminution or loss of continuity accompanies all\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to writing the above paragraphs, I took the opportunity of\r\nre-examining the magnificent series of gunshot fractures collected\r\nduring the Franco-German campaign by Sir William MacCormac, and\r\nafterwards presented by him to the museum of St. Thomas's Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe close approximation in type between the main features in these and\r\nthose in the fractures produced by the modern bullet is very striking.\r\nIn the case of the shafts of the long bones, the same stellate, oblique,\r\nwedge-shaped, and even perforating injuries are illustrated on a coarser\r\nscale. In a specimen of a patella, a perforation of the lower half,\r\nimplicating also the tendon of the quadriceps muscle is, though large,\r\nalmost as pure as a Mauser perforation.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the nature of the lesions of the bones is seen to be,\r\nfirstly, one of pure magnitude, corresponding to the size of the large\r\nSnider bullet by which they were produced. Thus the fragments generally\r\nare larger, and occupy a wider area of the shafts, the first character\r\ndepending on the lesser degree of velocity of the bullet, the latter on\r\nits volume and weight. Fine comminution, however, the most striking\r\nfeature of the modern injury, is throughout absent.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the larger size of the wedge provided by the bullet in\r\nincreasing the length of secondary longitudinal fissures is well marked,\r\nand for the same reason the perforations are usually accompanied by\r\nfissures of considerable extent. It is interesting to note, however,\r\nthat even in the case of the large bullets, and the special tendency\r\nshown by them to cause the extension of fissures into the joints, one or\r\ntwo specimens still show that these fissures incline to stop short when\r\nthe point of junction between the portion of the shaft occupied by the\r\nmedullary canal and that built on a foundation of cancellous tissue is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESIONS OF THE SHORT AND FLAT BONES\r\n\r\nThe above types of fracture are those common to the shafts of the long\r\nbones, but the difference in structure of the articular ends and the\r\nshort and flat bones endows lesions of these with somewhat different\r\ncharacters, the nature of which varies between grooving, perforation,\r\nand great comminution.\r\n\r\nThe most typical injury consists in the production of a clean\r\nperforation of the cancellous bone; this was common both in the\r\narticular ends and in the short bones. The tunnel differed little in\r\ncharacter from those already described, a tendency always existing to\r\nthe lifting of a lid of compact tissue at the exit end of the track.\r\n\r\nFor the production of the cleanest forms of injury I believe high rates\r\nof velocity were distinctly favourable, although I am unable to maintain\r\nthis statement by proof in the case of injuries received at the shortest\r\nranges of fire. When the velocity was lower, yet with force still\r\nsufficient to produce a perforating injury, the separation of an\r\nextensive scale of bone at the exit aperture was a marked feature not\r\nseen in perforations produced by higher degrees of velocity. Fig. 52, of\r\na perforation of the lower end of the femur, well exhibits this feature;\r\nbut it must be borne in mind in this case that the illustration is not a\r\npure one, both shaft and epiphysis taking part in the walls of the\r\ntrack, and the exit opening is in the former, where a thicker layer of\r\ncompact bone exists than would cover any epiphysis, and hence the\r\nfragment is larger. I use the example, however, because it so forcibly\r\nillustrates the effect of increased resistance on the part of the bone\r\nstruck in widening the area of the lesion. When the track was entirely\r\nlimited to the articular ends the small amount of damage at either\r\naperture was shown by clinical evidence in the rarity of subsequent\r\nlimitation of joint movements due to bony deformity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Oblique perforation, implicating both epiphysis\r\nand diaphysis. Large fragment detached at exit aperture. Caused by a\r\nbullet travelling at a low rate of velocity. Compare with figs. 71 and\r\n72 of a skull fracture. The dotted lines indicate the course of the\r\ntrack]\r\n\r\nAgain, it was rare for fissuring to extend from these tunnels to the\r\narticular surfaces; thus many instances could be given of perforation of\r\nthe head of the humerus, the olecranon, or the femoral condyles, in\r\nwhich no evidence of joint fissure was discoverable. The slight amount\r\nof resistance offered by the cancellous ends was also clinically\r\nillustrated by the absence of severe synovial effusions when they were\r\nstruck. When the joint cavity was not crossed, slight effusion only\r\nresulted, while in the case of fractures of the femoral shaft great\r\neffusion into the knee-joint, resulting from the forcible vibration\r\ntransmitted to the limb, was a common feature, even when the point\r\nfractured was situated above the centre of the bone. Again, when the\r\njoint cavity was crossed a moderate degree only of haemarthrosis was the\r\nmost common result.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the implication of joints, either primary or secondary,\r\nin connection with fractures of the articular ends, I am inclined to\r\nplace the lesions of the upper end of the tibia in a more important\r\nposition than those of any other bone. Evidence of this implication was\r\nin my experience more frequent here than in any other situation. This\r\nmay in part be attributable to the complexity of structure of this\r\nepiphysis, and perhaps more correctly to the influence of its irregular\r\noutline in favouring lateral forms of impact on the part of the bullet\r\nand consequent increase in the area of damage.\r\n\r\nNext to tunnelling, grooving was the most common form of injury to the\r\nshort bones. In the case of superficial tracks the compact tissue might\r\nbe considerably comminuted, but not, as a rule, over a width greatly\r\nexceeding the calibre of the bullet.\r\n\r\nComminution and crushing of a single or several bones were rare in\r\nproportion to the occurrence of similar injuries produced by\r\nMartini-Henry or large leaden bullets. When the condition was produced\r\nby bullets of small calibre, I believe it was in the majority of cases\r\nthe result of irregular impact on the part of the projectile. In support\r\nof this view it may be added that such injuries were most common in the\r\nbones of the tarsus, bones especially liable to be struck by ricochet\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\nIt was generally believed that bullets travelling at a very high degree\r\nof velocity were liable to cause severe comminution of the short bones,\r\nbut I never saw any cases supporting this opinion; in point of fact, all\r\nthe short-range lesions of this nature that I saw were of the clean\r\nperforating variety. I believe that this is capable of satisfactory\r\nexplanation on the ground of the thin character of the layer of compact\r\ntissue which for the most part ensheaths the short bones; this decreases\r\nthe resistance offered to the bullet and so tends to localise the\r\nlesion. This statement may be supported by two observations with regard\r\nto the long and flat bones. First, if the shaft of a long bone be hit\r\nabove the junction of diaphysis and epiphysis, the cancellous tissue in\r\nand extending from the medullary cavity is pulverised, and examination\r\nof fragments from such fractures gives the impression of the inner\r\naspect having been scraped clean. Secondly, I saw one fracture of the\r\nilium produced by a bullet taking a course between its compact layers\r\nfor 3 inches from the notch between the anterior superior and anterior\r\ninferior spines; the bone to the extent of 2-1/2 square inches was\r\npulverised, the cancellous tissue blown away as dust, and the compact\r\ntissue only represented by scales still adhering by their periosteum to\r\nthe muscles attached to the two surfaces of the bone. This injury was\r\nproduced from a rifle fired at five yards distance, and was an extreme\r\nexample; but, on the other hand, it illustrates only what we are\r\nthoroughly well acquainted with in the case of flat bones, such as those\r\nof the cranium, where the compact element is abundant in comparison with\r\nthe cancellous, and the resistance offered to the bullet is consequently\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nSome remarks on transverse fractures of the patella will be found under\r\nthe heading devoted to that bone.\r\n\r\nLesions of the flat bones are considered at some length in Chapter VII.,\r\nwhich deals with injuries to the head, and their special features are\r\nthere described; some further remarks on these injuries will be found\r\nunder the headings of the individual bones.\r\n\r\n_Special characters of the symptoms observed, and of the course of\r\nhealing of the fractures._--Peculiarities in the initial signs may be\r\nrapidly passed over. The first depended on the large number of lesions\r\nof the bone which were unaccompanied by loss of continuity. In the case\r\nof perforations attention to the course of the track, external\r\npalpation, and possibly the detection of bone dust in the aperture of\r\nexit, were usually sufficient to indicate injury to the bones. When\r\nthese did not suffice the introduction of a probe would usually set the\r\nquestion at rest; but this is always to be avoided if possible, as\r\nadding a fresh item of risk to the wound. The X rays were not always to\r\nhand, and are not always capable of giving reliable information in the\r\nmatter of perforations, although very useful in detecting grooves or\r\nnotching. The latter injuries are those in which information as to the\r\ncondition of the bones is often of most interest in view of the\r\ncharacters of the external wounds.\r\n\r\nFractures with solution of continuity were, as a rule, easy of\r\ndetection, but the relative prominence of the classical signs varied\r\nsomewhat from what we are accustomed to see in civil practice.\r\n\r\nThe first striking peculiarity noted in comminuted fractures of the long\r\nbones was the degree of local shock; the limbs were often quite\r\npowerless, the muscles flaccid, and common sensation lowered. This was\r\nof importance in two ways; firstly, shortening of the limb was often\r\nabsent as a sign, and, secondly, pain was sometimes not at all\r\npronounced even when the patient was moved. The primary absence of\r\nshortening, even persisting for the first two or three days, was a\r\nphenomenon always important to bear in mind, as it affected the degree\r\nof extension needed in the treatment of the fracture, which, if\r\nsufficient at the moment, often proved quite inadequate with the return\r\nof tone in the muscles. Secondly, abnormal mobility was usually strongly\r\nmarked, and this sometimes without very definite crepitus, as a result\r\nof the fine nature of the comminution and the displacement of the small\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of healing some other peculiarities are worthy of\r\nmention. First of all, union was tardy and often not strong. On the\r\nother hand, an abundance of provisional callus was common, which formed\r\nlarge swellings apt to implicate neighbouring nerves, and sometimes to\r\ninterfere with the movements of joints. The slowness of healing was\r\nparticularly noticeable in those cases where the degree of local shock\r\nhad been marked, and was probably to some extent dependent on\r\ndisturbance of the general nutrition of the tissues of the affected\r\nlimb. Beyond this, however, it was in many cases a direct result of the\r\ndegree of comminution and displacement of the fragments, which\r\nnecessitated the formation of a large amount of provisional callus, and\r\ntime for the proper consolidation and contraction of the same. In many\r\ncases a large ball-like mass of callus surrounding the fragments was\r\ndeveloped, into which the actual ends of the broken bone only dipped,\r\nand hence union was weak and insecure. As to those cases in which the\r\nwounds closed by primary union, we must bear in mind in this relation\r\nthe tardy union often observed in civil practice, when the irritation of\r\nsuppuration and consequent inflammation are absent.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of a similar nature was the occasional late necrosis\r\nof fragments; the wounds apparently healed well, only to break down\r\nweeks or months later for the discharge of a sequestrum. Such cases were\r\nquite distinct from those in which primary suppuration had occurred. I\r\nsaw one or two instances in fractures of the humerus, the trouble\r\narising with commencing use of the limb, and I suppose that fragments\r\nwhich suffered death at the time of the injury had been enclosed, and\r\nonly caused irritation as foreign bodies when the muscles again came\r\ninto action. In the absence both of evident necrosis and suppuration,\r\nhowever, in some cases the exit portion of the track in the soft parts\r\nwas extremely slow in healing. Although no discharge beyond a small\r\nquantity of blood-tinged serum escaped, the wounds remained open for\r\nmany weeks, even when the fracture consolidated well. I ascribed this to\r\nslow separation of aseptic sloughs, a point which has already been\r\nmentioned under the heading of wounds in general.\r\n\r\nSuperabundance of callus, as far as I had an opportunity of judging,\r\ncomparatively seldom gave rise to permanent mechanical trouble. This was\r\nno doubt due to the infrequency of extension of the comminuted fractures\r\nbeyond the junction of diaphysis and epiphysis.\r\n\r\nLastly, with regard to suppuration, only a small proportion of the\r\nfractures, accompanied by the presence of large wounds, escaped\r\ninfection. When infection did occur, the results offered some special\r\nfeatures dependent on the small relative amount of damage to the soft\r\ntissues, compared with that suffered by the bone. In an ordinary\r\ncompound fracture, such as we meet with in civil practice, whether the\r\nresult of direct or indirect violence, a considerable amount of\r\ncontusion or laceration, as the case may be, accompanies the injury to\r\nthe bone. The result of this is a widespread effusion of blood into the\r\nlimb, which tears and strips up the various layers of soft parts, and\r\nopens up the way to the spread of infection, often into the whole\r\nlength of the segment of the limb affected. In fractures produced by\r\nbullets of small calibre, even when the exit portion of the track is\r\nlarge, the injury to the soft parts is far more localised, except in\r\nextreme cases, while the bone itself is the tissue which has suffered\r\nthe most severe violence and contusion. When infection occurred, its\r\nspread corresponded with this anatomical feature of the lesion, and the\r\nbone itself and its immediate neighbourhood suffered the most severely.\r\n\r\nAt the present day one is naturally not very familiar with a large\r\nseries of suppurating compound fractures, but during my whole experience\r\nI have never seen so many cases of what might be regarded as fairly pure\r\ninstances of acute osteo-myelitis. The symptoms corresponded with the\r\nmain seat of the suppuration; only moderate swelling of the limbs\r\noccurred, this mainly consisting in soft superficial oedema; often\r\nthere was no redness, and fluctuation was difficult to determine. At the\r\nsame time symptoms of constitutional infection, such as continued fever,\r\nrapid pulse, restlessness, loss of strength, progressive anaemia, and\r\nemaciation, were marked. Pyaemia, as evidenced by secondary deposits,\r\nwas, however, rare; I only saw two cases, both in fractures of the\r\nfemur; in both recovery followed secondary amputation.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--This depended almost entirely on the nature of the injury\r\nto the soft parts; given moderate injury to these, and the preservation\r\nof the wound from infection, scarcely any degree of injury of the bones\r\nprecluded recovery, even if this were slow and prolonged. The existence\r\nof perforations scarcely increased to an important extent the gravity of\r\na wound of the soft parts alone; in fact, this injury could not be\r\nregarded as more severe than an ordinary surgical osteotomy, putting the\r\nrisks of infection of the wound under the special circumstances on one\r\nside.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the functional results, these depended on the degree of\r\ncomminution; when this was extreme, union was slow and for a time weak,\r\nand shortening was often considerable, but a fair result was as a rule\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nSuppuration and osteo-myelitis were the dangerous features when they\r\noccurred; still, even in the presence of these, I never saw a fatal\r\nresult in an upper extremity fracture, although in the lower extremity\r\na considerable mortality followed fractures both of the leg and thigh,\r\nthe deaths being most commonly from septicaemia, or from a combination of\r\nthis with secondary haemorrhage.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The general treatment was of a simple character. The\r\nperforations may be at once dismissed, since nothing more was needed\r\nthan what has been already described under the heading of wounds of the\r\nsoft parts. Again, with regard to the co-existence of vascular injury,\r\nor injury to the soft parts generally, the ordinary rules guiding us in\r\ncivil practice were followed.\r\n\r\nThe first point of importance, and needing consideration in the\r\ntreatment of severely comminuted fractures, was as to whether in these\r\nit was better simply to try to obtain union of the wound with as little\r\ndisturbance as possible, or to anaesthetise the patient and explore the\r\nwound, removing such fragments as were free or widely displaced. I think\r\nthe answer to this question depends entirely on the nature of the\r\nexternal wounds. If these be of the small type forms, or if the exit\r\naperture is, at any rate, of only moderate size, a strictly conservative\r\nattitude is the better when the risk of making an exploration under the\r\ncircumstances is borne in mind, the more so as an exploration, to be\r\nsafe and useful, ought to be done at once. If the exit wound is of the\r\nlarge or explosive type, on the other hand, there is no doubt that the\r\nbest results are to be obtained by early exploration and the removal of\r\nall loose fragments. I saw several excellent results obtained in this\r\nway, even when the patients had to undergo the risk of transport\r\nshortly, in some cases the very next day, after the operation. The loose\r\nfragments are an immediate source of danger, and later may interfere\r\nwith the healing of the fracture, even if suppuration does not occur. In\r\nall the cases that I saw the exit wound was dressed, but left freely\r\nopen, and I do not think any attempt to close it should ever be made.\r\n\r\nThe question of operative fixation rarely needs consideration; it\r\noccasionally happens, however, that oblique fractures, such as one\r\nmentioned on p. 166, are met with, in which screwing or wiring of the\r\nbone ends is advisable. What has been said above as to fractures,\r\naccompanied by loss of continuity, applies equally to cases of severe\r\nwedge-fracture, where many loose fragments exist.\r\n\r\nAs to the disinfection of the limb, primary cleansing, mainly by soap\r\nand water, of course precedes the exploration, and when the latter has\r\nbeen carried out a second cleansing and disinfection, preferably with\r\nspirit and carbolic acid lotion, are imperative.\r\n\r\nImmobilisation is a more difficult problem. In practised hands\r\nplaster-of-Paris splints answer most requirements except in the case of\r\nthe thigh; but the splints take time to apply and also to set firmly,\r\nand, as sometimes needing frequent removal, are not altogether suitable\r\nfor Field hospital work. Of all the splints I saw in use, I think the\r\nbest were wire splints, and the Dutch cane folding splints for the thigh\r\nand leg (figs. 56, 58); wire-gauze splints with steel at the margins\r\n(fig. 54), or strips of ordinary cardboard applied with some variety of\r\nadhesive bandage for the arm and forearm; and plain wooden of various\r\nlengths for any situation.\r\n\r\nA question of constant difficulty was that of frequency of dressing; in\r\na Stationary or Base hospital this is not difficult, as the same surgeon\r\nhas the patient continuously under his charge, and can readily decide as\r\nto the proper moment for the renewal of the dressing. When the patient\r\nis, however, being moved from the Field to the Stationary hospital, and\r\nthence to the Base, a constant succession of surgeons has the case in\r\nhand for short periods, the movements during transport disturb the\r\nfixity of the dressing, and, in consequence, dressings are apt to be far\r\nmore frequent than is advisable. This question raises the larger one of\r\nthe advisability of _any_ transport beyond what may be an actual\r\nnecessity. There is only one answer to this. No fractures of the thigh\r\nor leg, and few of the arm, can be transported for any distance without\r\nmaterial disadvantage. The risks attendant on disturbance of the\r\nfracture and tissue injury, septic infection as a result of slipping of\r\nthe dressing and the impracticability of efficiently renewing it, far\r\nmore than counterbalance any advantage to be gained from the superior\r\ncomforts available at a Base hospital. For these reasons, if possible,\r\nall fractures of the arm, thigh, or leg should be kept at a Stationary\r\nhospital for a period of three or more weeks, and, as far as splints and\r\nappliances are concerned, these should be as numerous and complete as at\r\na Base hospital. I have had a useful set made of aluminium. A word will\r\nbe added later as to the splints suitable for different regions of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for _primary amputation_ chiefly depends on the nature of\r\nthe injury to the soft parts, less commonly on the extent of the injury\r\nto the bones, and should be decided on exactly the same lines as in\r\ncivil practice. So-called intermediate amputations are always to be\r\navoided if possible; the results were consistently bad, and the\r\noperation should only be undertaken in cases of severe sepsis where\r\nlittle can be hoped from it, or for secondary haemorrhage. When the\r\noperation could be tided over until the septic process had settled down\r\nand localised itself, secondary amputation gave very fair results. In\r\neither intermediate or secondary amputation for suppurating fractures,\r\nit was necessary to bear in mind the special likelihood of the existence\r\nof extensive osteo-myelitis. If this condition affected the upper\r\nfragment, an amputation was of little use unless the whole bone was\r\nremoved, as septic infection continued and brought about a fatal issue,\r\nor a fresh amputation was required in order to obtain a stump that would\r\nheal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FRACTURES\r\n\r\n_Upper Extremity._--Fractures of the _scapula_ were not uncommon, but\r\nwere mostly of the perforative variety; thus perforations both of the\r\nspine in longitudinal wounds of the back, and of the ala in perforating\r\nwounds of the thorax, were tolerably frequent. They possessed little\r\npractical interest; as a rule, the openings were not large, and the most\r\nunexpected feature was the small interference with the movements of the\r\nbone on the chest wall that resulted. It might be assumed that\r\ncomminuted fragments would project into the muscles and cause both pain\r\nand interference with movement; but neither was the case. I saw grooving\r\nof the crest of the spine, but never happened to meet with a fracture\r\nof the acromion process. Many axillary tracks passed in the closest\r\nproximity to the coracoid, but this again I never saw separated. One\r\npractical point of importance with regard to the scapula was the\r\nfrequency with which bullets lodged in the venter, or the firmly\r\nbound-down muscles of the supra- and infra-spinous fossae. These retained\r\nbullets often gave rise to remarkably little trouble in this situation;\r\nthus I have a skiagram of a shrapnel bullet lying in the deepest part of\r\nthe subscapular fossa, which did not inconvenience its possessor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53. Head of Humerus, showing broken perforation. The\r\nroof forms a hinged covering to a groove.]\r\n\r\nEvery variety of _fracture of the clavicle_ was met with, even\r\nperforation of the most compact portion of the shaft; comminuted, wedge,\r\nor notched fractures were, however, the more common, and were\r\naccompanied by the development of very large masses of provisional\r\ncallus during the process of healing. An interesting skiagram is\r\nreproduced in plate III., which shows a compound form of injury to the\r\nclavicle. The bullet has passed obliquely beneath the acromial end,\r\nrising to perforate the posterior compact margin, and producing one of\r\nthe diamond-shaped openings sometimes occurring in compact bone with the\r\npassage of bullets at a low rate of velocity. No case of perforation of\r\nthe subclavian vein by comminuted fragments of the clavicle came under\r\nmy notice.\r\n\r\n_Fractures of the humerus_ of every variety were common, and I think\r\nwhen the statistics of the campaign are published, it will be shown that\r\nthe humerus was the most frequently injured individual bone in the whole\r\nbody. I remember to have seen thirteen fractures of the shaft of the\r\nhumerus in one pavilion alone at Wynberg after the battle of Paardeberg.\r\n\r\nPerforations of the upper articular extremity were common, and as a rule\r\ngave rise to wonderfully little trouble in the shoulder-joint. The outer\r\naspect of the head of the humerus is a common situation for the\r\nproduction of a special form of broken canal or groove (fig. 53). The\r\nslope from the greater tuberosity to the shaft naturally favours the\r\nproduction of the injury in this position.\r\n\r\nI saw only one case in which a vertical fissure extended from a fracture\r\nof the shaft into the shoulder-joint; in this case the transverse\r\nsolution of continuity was at the upper part of the middle third of the\r\nbone. Skiagram, plate IV., illustrates a well-marked stellate\r\ncomminution of the shaft with large fragments. Plate V. shows extreme\r\ncomminution with fragments blown out of the wound. Two plates, Nos. VI.\r\nand VIII., illustrate well the difference resulting from the oblique\r\npassage of a bullet at high and low rates of velocity respectively. In\r\nboth cases good results were obtained; in the more severe the resultant\r\nmass of ensheathing callus was very large, temporarily interfered with\r\nflexion of the elbow-joint, and consolidation was very slow (see plate\r\nVII.). The patient was wounded at Belmont in November 1899, but he was\r\nable to row at the end of the summer of 1900, although very prolonged\r\nsuppuration occurred, and the elbow movements became practically normal.\r\nPlate IX. illustrates a transverse track, the bullet having undergone\r\nconsiderable injury during its passage through the bone, as evidenced by\r\nthe presence of fragments both of mantle and lead in the limb. This\r\nmight be called an example of transverse fracture, and illustrates the\r\nnearest approach to one seen when the bone is struck fairly plumb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(24) COMMINUTED FRACTURE OF THE HUMERUS\r\n\r\nRange about '300 yards.'\r\n\r\nThe wound track took a directly antero-posterior course. Impact\r\nrectangular. The musculo-spiral nerve was completely divided.\r\n\r\nThe plate affords a good example of the so-called 'butterfly' fracture.\r\nTwo long doubly wedge-shaped lateral fragments, and pointed extremities\r\nto both main fragments, are shown.\r\n\r\nThe fracture healed well, with the deposition of a large mass of\r\nprovisional callus. The musculo-spiral nerve was united by suture some\r\nthree months later.]\r\n\r\nPlate VIII. exhibits an oblique fracture of the lower part of the shaft\r\nproduced by a bullet passing at a low rate of velocity. It does not\r\nwidely differ from a perforation, and the illustration possesses some\r\nfurther interest as showing the deviation of a bullet likely to occur\r\nwhen a bone lies in its course. Although the velocity with which this\r\nbullet was travelling must have been very low, when the bone had been\r\ntraversed the deviation in its course was slight. A few bony fragments\r\nfrom the compact tissue of the posterior surface of the humerus have\r\nbeen carried into the distal portion of the track.\r\n\r\nFractures of the various prominences of the lower articular extremity\r\nwere not uncommon, but deviated little from the types with which we are\r\nfamiliar in civil practice; the after results were good, both as to\r\nunion and movement of the elbow.\r\n\r\nExplosive wounds of the soft parts were not infrequent in the arm, and\r\nfig. 48, p. 158, exhibits an extreme example. The humerus in respect of\r\ndepth of covering, however, comes between the femur and the bones of the\r\nleg and forearm; hence such injuries were not so easily produced as in\r\nthe latter segments of the limbs.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the subject of fractures of this bone, one word must\r\nbe added as to the occurrence of the most characteristic of its\r\ncomplications, musculo-spiral paralysis. This was frequent in every\r\nposition of the fracture, and came on either immediately, or, at a\r\nsubsequent period, as a result of callus irritation or pressure. Its\r\nfrequency is only what would be expected when the nature of the fracture\r\nis considered, but the chief interest of the condition lay in the\r\ndifficulty of certainly detecting it in the initial stages of the cases;\r\nthis depended on the fact that in many of them the local shock to the\r\nlimb was so severe that the function of the whole of the muscles was\r\nlowered, or in some cases, although the musculo-spiral was the nerve\r\nchiefly affected, the other large trunks had also suffered concussion or\r\ncontusion. In consequence of this difficulty the actual localised\r\nparalysis often only became evident at the end of a week, or even more,\r\nwhen there was difficulty in deciding as to whether the paralysis was\r\nprimary or due to secondary trouble. In the fracture illustrated by\r\nskiagram, plate IV., the nerve suffered complete division, and was\r\nunited some three months later, improvement in the symptoms being very\r\nslow. The latter was a common experience, and although not unusual in\r\ncivil practice, I think it is more marked in these injuries as a result\r\nof the more widespread character of the nerve lesion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(25) COMMINUTED FRACTURE OF THE HUMERUS\r\n\r\nRange '50 yards.' Velocity extreme.\r\n\r\nImpact somewhat oblique. The bullet entered anteriorly about 3 inches\r\nabove the elbow crease. The wound of exit was on the inner aspect of the\r\narm and explosive in character; it still measured 4 inches by 2 inches\r\nthree weeks after the injury was received.\r\n\r\nThe wounds suppurated locally, but at the end of six weeks fair union of\r\nthe bone had taken place and the wound of exit had contracted to a\r\nsinus. The musculo-spiral nerve was concussed, but not divided.\r\n\r\nThe skiagram was taken three weeks after the reception of the injury.\r\n\r\nComparison with plate IV. demonstrates the effect of high velocity in\r\nfree comminution of the bone, the sharper radiation of the stellate\r\nlines of fracture, and the propulsion of bone fragments.]\r\n\r\nThe _bones of the forearm_ were also often fractured. The principal\r\npeculiarity of these fractures was the common localisation of the injury\r\nto one bone, which is readily seen to be probable.\r\n\r\nEach bone offered some special features dependent on its structural\r\ncharacter and anatomical position. In the case of the _ulna_, pure\r\nperforation of the olecranon process, without obvious evidence of\r\nimplication of the elbow, was seen on several occasions. The other\r\nimportant feature with regard to this bone depends on its subcutaneous\r\nposition, which accounted for the frequency with which highly developed\r\nexplosive exit wounds were met with. One is figured in the general\r\nsection (fig. 47, p. 156). This, however, is a very slight instance\r\ncompared with what was often seen in the upper and middle thirds of the\r\nbone, where the lateral soft parts often protruded as a much larger\r\ntumour, the particular illustration being mainly designed to show the\r\nnature of the injury to the skin. The _radius_, as more deeply placed in\r\nthe upper part of its course, was less often the seat of such\r\nwell-marked explosive injuries; but when the lower end was struck this\r\ncharacter was sometimes very striking: thus in a track passing\r\nantero-posteriorly through this bone, the whole lower end appeared\r\nshattered, all the tendons at the back of the wrist being implicated in\r\nthe protruding mass, while the bone itself seemed shortened, so that the\r\nhand took up the position common in Colles's fracture. It was found\r\nimpossible to place the bone in good position; nevertheless the patient\r\nretained his hand, which is still of use in writing.\r\n\r\nPlate X. is a good example of a high-velocity injury in which lateral\r\ncontact with the radius has produced local comminution, some slight\r\ninjury to the casing of the bullet, and the separation of a large wedge.\r\nThe case from which this was taken also illustrated well one of the\r\nchief troubles of such fractures of the forearm; the degree of\r\nsplintering resulted in the formation of a large mass of callus, which\r\nfor a time rendered any degree of pronation and supination impossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(26) COMMINUTED FRACTURE OF THE HUMERUS\r\n\r\nRange '250 yards.'\r\n\r\nImpact oblique. Wound of entry 1 inch below the insertion of the\r\ndeltoid; exit, on inner aspect of arm at a slightly lower level. The\r\nbullet probably struck the bone laterally, and drove out the central\r\nfragment.\r\n\r\nProlonged suppuration resulted, but the humerus healed well, and good\r\nmovement of the elbow was preserved.\r\n\r\nThe effect of oblique impact together with high velocity is well\r\nillustrated. Had the resistance been greater, as in the case of the\r\nfemur, a nearer resemblance to the effect seen in plate XV. would have\r\nbeen the result.]\r\n\r\nOf _fractures of the hand_ I have little to say. In the case of the\r\n_carpus_, the slight degree of resistance offered by the bones rendered\r\ninjuries of an explosive character rare. I never saw one. Fractures of\r\nthe _metacarpus_, on the other hand, presented exactly the opposite\r\nfeatures. The density of these small bones was well illustrated by the\r\nfrequency with which the bullet suffered injury, even amounting to\r\nfragmentation, and the great comminution they themselves suffered. The\r\nbreaking up of the bullet in these fractures was a curious feature,\r\nwhich may perhaps be explained by the tendency of the distal part of the\r\nlimb to be driven in the course of the bullet, with the result of\r\nsomewhat lengthening the period of contact of the projectile, or more\r\nprobably by somewhat frequently occurring irregular impact. Plate XI. is\r\na good example of an injury of this nature of moderate severity. The\r\nsoft parts suffered much in these injuries, the tendons were torn and\r\nlacerated at the moment, and were very apt to acquire more or less\r\npermanent adhesion. This latter condition was sometimes to be improved\r\nby the removal of bone fragments, and I have freed tendons from actual\r\nclefts in the bones where they had been carried in by the bullet. In\r\nsome cases very great deformity of the digits, due to shortening,\r\ndeveloped, even when no fragments were removed beyond those blown away\r\nby the bullet.\r\n\r\nOne form of injury of some interest was multiple fracture of the\r\nphalanges produced by a bullet travelling in a course parallel to the\r\nlength of the rifle when pointed by the patient. Occasionally several\r\ndigits were lost.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of fractures of the upper extremity._--The general lines of\r\nthis have already been foreshadowed in the general section, the remarks\r\nas to transport being applicable to all serious fractures of the shaft\r\nof the humerus, and this is the only one of the bones of the upper\r\nextremity on which anything special need be said, as the treatment of\r\nall the other fractures exactly coincides with that of ordinary civil\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(26_a_) CONDITION OF THE SAME FRACTURE SHOWN IN PLATE VI., A YEAR AFTER\r\nITS PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe ensheathing callus is still very abundant, but less so than at an\r\nearlier date. No trouble with the musculo-spiral nerve was noted, but\r\nresidual abscesses occurred from time to time in connection with the\r\nfracture.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--German Wire Gauze Splint on steel wire\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\n(German Ambulance, Heilbron)]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of wounds should be on the lines already laid down:\r\nthorough cleansing, and then an attempt to seal. In severely comminuted\r\nfractures, however, the exit wound may be of very large size, and then\r\nfrequent dressings are necessary. Loose fragments, by which those freed\r\nfrom their periosteal connections are meant, need removal. The question\r\nwhich most interested me was the best method of fixation. This needs to\r\nbe sufficient to effect immobility, but on the other hand in many cases\r\nthe weight of the arm as a means of extension is very valuable. Some of\r\nthe most successfully treated cases that I saw were fixed by means of\r\nsimple strips of pasteboard, applied moist, and fixed with an adhesive\r\nbandage. Ordinary book-muslin bandages are as good as anything for this\r\npurpose, as they can be reinforced by a stronger form outside them.\r\nWhere necessary, an angular piece of cardboard can be applied on the\r\ninner aspect, or a wooden angular splint may be substituted, if it is at\r\nhand; but in this case most of the advantage of the weight of the arm as\r\na means of extension is lost. The cardboard cases possess the great\r\nadvantage of being readily cut off and reapplied much as is done with\r\nplaster of Paris. During the period in which dressing may be necessary I\r\nbelieve this form of splint is as good as can be got for use in Field\r\nhospitals, the only point needing care being to ensure that the\r\nbandaging is not too tight. It is much more reliable than are ordinary\r\nsplints if transport is unavoidable, and is much lighter and less\r\nirksome to the patient. With such strips of cardboard, a few of the\r\ngauze splints (fig. 54), and a few angular and wooden splints, I believe\r\na Field hospital is fully equipped for the treatment of any fractures of\r\nthe upper extremity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H.

The wound\r\nof entry was just below the elbow.\r\n\r\nThe bullet has cut its way through the inner half of the humerus,\r\nproducing little comminution and mere solution of continuity of the bone\r\nwithout displacement]\r\n\r\n_Fractures of the pelvis._--These, as a rule, were of so slight a nature\r\nas to form a very insignificant part of the entire injury with which\r\nthey were associated, or when uncomplicated they were of little more\r\nimportance than simple wounds of the soft parts. The very great majority\r\nwere of the simple perforating type. I had the opportunity of examining\r\nthree at the brim of the pelvis, these all passing in a downward\r\ndirection. The openings were of about the same calibre as the bullet,\r\nand at their entrance was a small amount of bone dust such as would be\r\nfound at the entry hole of a gimlet. It was these that made me consider\r\nthe possibility of the rifle grooves having some part in the ease with\r\nwhich certain perforations are made. Of a large number of cases in which\r\nbullets traversed the ilium, the openings in the bone, as a rule, were\r\nwith difficulty palpated. I must say that I was astonished that I never\r\nmet with an instance of an extensive stellate fracture in the case of\r\nthe ilium. Such may have occurred in some of the cases fatal on the\r\nfield or shortly afterwards, but I never came across one in the\r\nhospital. It says much for the combined density and toughness of the\r\nhuman pelvis.\r\n\r\nComminuted fractures were, however, occasionally met with when the\r\nbullet passed in a track parallel to the plane of the bone. One such of\r\nan unusual character has already been mentioned on p. 171. A still more\r\ninteresting form, and one highly characteristic of flat bone injuries,\r\nis shown in fig. 55. The patient, a man wounded at Modder River, was\r\nstruck at a range of 300 to 400 yards. The bullet entered over about the\r\ncentre of the ilium and emerged in the anterior abdominal wall about 2\r\ninches above the anterior-superior spine. As there was some doubt as to\r\npenetration of the abdomen, and as the exit wound was of considerable\r\nsize, the wound was explored, an anaesthetic having been given. A\r\nclean-cut track in the bone was discovered which allowed the middle\r\nfinger to be placed in it. There was little splintering of either inner\r\nor outer table of the bone beyond the width of the track, but plates of\r\neach table adhered on the one side to the origin of the gluteus medius,\r\nand on the other to the iliacus, the latter muscle being somewhat widely\r\nseparated from the venter ilii by effused blood. There was no\r\nperforation of the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(28) LOCALISED COMMINUTED FRACTURE OF THE HUMERUS\r\n\r\nRange '100 yards.'\r\n\r\nThe entry and exit wounds were on the front and back aspects of the arm,\r\nabout 3 inches above the elbow.\r\n\r\nFragmentation of the mantle of the bullet has occurred. It will be noted\r\nthat the fragments are lodged in both the proximal and distal segments\r\nof the track. This may indicate that the bullet was damaged prior to\r\nentry, or the recoil of fragments. I incline to the latter view. The\r\nskiagram was taken a fortnight after the injury.\r\n\r\nThe large median fragment carried forwards, and the small degree of\r\ncomminution, suggest the decrease of resistance and prolongation of\r\nimpact by carriage back of the arm when struck.\r\n\r\nThe fracture is one of the nearest approaches to a transverse cleft that\r\nI met with.\r\n\r\nThe plate may well be compared with No. XII., where the effect of\r\nincreased resistance in augmenting the degree of comminution is seen.]\r\n\r\nLesser degrees of the same kind of injury amounting to grooving of the\r\nsurface or notching of the crest of the ilium were not uncommon, and the\r\noccasional large character of exit openings in buttock wounds pointed to\r\ncontact of travelling bullets with other parts of the external pelvic\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Clean Gutter Fracture of the Ilium (range\r\nplaced by patient at 300 yards. Highland Brigade, Magersfontein). The\r\ngutter was clean cut, and admitted the forefinger. The inner and outer\r\ntables of the bone were in part blown out of a large irregularly\r\ncircular exit opening about 1-1/2 in. above the crest of the ilium. The\r\ncancellous tissue was probably entirely blown out. Plates of the outer\r\nand inner tables still remained connected by their periosteum to the\r\ndeep aspects of the iliacus and gluteus medius muscles. The peritoneal\r\ncavity was not opened. The patient did well. Compare with the gutter\r\nfractures of the skull shown in figs. 64, 66.]\r\n\r\nCertain portions of the pelvis were subject to more severe comminution;\r\nthus in one case in which the bladder was wounded, a very much\r\ncomminuted fracture of the horizontal ramus of the pubes was produced by\r\na bullet which subsequently lodged in the thigh behind the femoral\r\nvessels. In this case the track was so oblique as to have necessitated\r\nalmost pure lateral impact on the part of the bullet; hence the form of\r\ninjury was nearly allied to the comminutions of the ilium already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd\r\n\r\n(29) Wedge-shaped Fracture of the Radius\r\n\r\nRange 'a few yards.'\r\n\r\nThe officer shot the man, his assailant, with a revolver. The entry\r\nwound was on the posterior aspect of the forearm at the junction of the\r\nmiddle and lower thirds. The exit wound was on the anterior aspect of\r\nthe forearm, 1 inch below the elbow crease, and of moderate size.\r\n\r\nSome fine fragmentation of the mantle of the bullet is indicated, and\r\nvery fine comminution of the bone. The fracture healed well, but the\r\nresulting mass of callus at the end of three months prevented any\r\nmovements of pronation or supination.]\r\n\r\nI never observed a fracture of the floor of the acetabulum by a bullet\r\nwhich had entered from the back of the pelvis, although tracks entering\r\nby the great sciatic notch were not infrequent. I saw one case in which\r\na bullet which traversed the upper part of the shoulder and emerged at\r\nthe axilla entered a second time an inch behind and above the anterior\r\nsuperior spine, and split off a layer of the outer table of the ilium of\r\nthe extent of two square inches, which involved the upper portion of the\r\nrim of the acetabulum. No displacement upwards of the femur resulted;\r\nbut external rotation was accompanied by crepitus. The wound suppurated,\r\nand some general infection resulted, but six weeks later there was no\r\nevidence of fluid in the hip-joint, the limb was adducted and slightly\r\nrotated outwards, and some movement in each direction could be made\r\nwithout causing any great amount of pain. I can say nothing of the\r\nfurther course of this case, as I neglected to take the patient's name.\r\n\r\nI saw one or two instances of perforation of the sacrum. One is\r\nmentioned in the chapter on injuries to the abdomen, in which a central\r\npuncture at the level of the fourth vertebra was accompanied by\r\ntemporary incontinence of faeces.\r\n\r\nFractures of the _femur_ were fairly numerous and formed one of the most\r\nserious classes of case we had to treat, as well as one of the most\r\nfertile sources of mortality in the Base hospitals. In spite of the last\r\nobservation, however, it is probable that the results in this campaign\r\nwill be far better than in any previous war, both as to the smaller\r\nproportion in which amputation was needed and as to recovery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(30) COMMINUTED FRACTURE OF THE SECOND METACARPAL BONE\r\n\r\nLarge fragments of the mantle of the bullet.\r\n\r\nFragmentation of the bullet was comparatively common when the metacarpal\r\nbones were struck, also free comminution of a somewhat coarser variety\r\nthan that seen when bones offering greater resistance were struck.\r\n\r\nThis may be a result of the more frequent lateral impact of the bullet\r\non these small bones.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of a considerable experience, I never saw a case of perforation\r\nof either the head or neck of the thigh bone. I saw numerous tracks\r\nemerging at the side of the femoral vessels and entering at the buttock\r\nor vice versa, but never one accompanied either by effusion into the\r\nhip-joint or impairment of movement. Considering the regularity with\r\nwhich haemarthrosis occurred when the other joints were crossed, and also\r\nthe nature of the compact tissue of the neck of the femur, which must\r\nhave ensured some splintering, I do not think I can have overlooked an\r\ninjury of this nature. No doubt also the escape of the neck of the bone\r\nwas explained in some of the cases by the fact that the injuries were\r\nreceived while the hip-joint was in a position of flexion, the bullet\r\npassing over the neck of the femur. In two cases of extensive\r\ncomminution of the upper third of the femur that I saw, the fissures\r\nstopped short at the inter-trochanteric line anteriorly, but in one of\r\nthem a large angular fragment was torn out of the posterior surface of\r\nthe neck.\r\n\r\nExcepting transverse fracture every form was met with in the shaft,\r\nalthough I saw only two instances of perforation. One has been already\r\nalluded to and was situated in the broadening portion of the lower\r\nthird, the bullet taking an antero-posterior course. The second is seen\r\nin plate XVII.\r\n\r\nPlate XII. shows an instance of extreme comminution of the upper third\r\naccompanied by the presence of two typical elongated fragments. The\r\ncourse taken by the bullet was almost directly antero-posterior, and the\r\nwounds were of moderate size even in the case of the exit one. This\r\nseems to preclude the possibility of the injury having been produced by\r\na ricochet bullet, while the fact of perforation and escape of the\r\nbullet in spite of the serious damage suffered by the mantle points to\r\nthe injury having been produced at a short range of fire. The patient\r\nhimself owns to being quite unable to give any estimate of the distance.\r\nAlthough no suppuration occurred, this fracture was very slow in\r\nconsolidating, and the free comminution with consequent inaccurate\r\napposition led to the development of four inches shortening of the limb.\r\nThe skiagram was taken about six weeks after the occurrence of the\r\ninjury, a few days after I first saw the patient; I have, however, had\r\nthe opportunity of seeing a second skiagram taken some four months\r\nlater. This is of considerable interest, as throwing light on the mode\r\nof union of such fractures. The two elongated fragments in the later\r\nskiagram are widened to three times their original breadth, and form\r\nbuttresses on either side of the point of union, while the irregular\r\nends of the shaft are rounded off, and the mass of fine fragments behind\r\nis consolidated. Beyond this the second skiagram shows that the upper\r\nfragment, apparently intact in the first, was really split\r\nlongitudinally, and therefore was far less useful as a point of support\r\nthan might have been assumed from the earlier skiagram, plate XIII. The\r\ncase illustrates well the chief difficulty in the treatment of such\r\nfractures: that of maintaining the fragments in line, since absolutely\r\nno help is received from the apposition of the two ends, and artificial\r\ntraction alone must be relied upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(31) HIGHLY COMMINUTED FRACTURE OF THE UPPER THIRD OF THE SHAFT OF THE\r\nFEMUR\r\n\r\nRange 'short.'\r\n\r\nImpact fairly direct. The wounds were of moderate size and at nearly the\r\nsame level. The exit wound near the buttock fold was of moderate size,\r\nand presented no special features.\r\n\r\nConsiderable fragmentation of the bullet occurred. The comminution of\r\nthe bone is very fine, suggesting high velocity, and great resistance by\r\nthe bone. The skiagram was taken five weeks after the injury was\r\nreceived, and at that time no union had occurred.\r\n\r\nReference to plate XIII. will explain more fully the difficulty\r\nexperienced in maintaining this fracture in position. The upper fragment\r\nis seen to be split into fragments, beyond the separation of the long\r\nsplinter on the inner side; hence no aid was to be obtained from the\r\napposition of the ends. About 2 inches of the shaft were actually\r\npulverised; the fine fragments seen in a mass to the inner side of the\r\nbone in the exit portion of the back, eventually formed a large mass of\r\ncallus, and the fracture united, with considerable shortening.]\r\n\r\nPlate XIV. offers a good contrast; the fracture here presents a typical\r\nstellate form, and a good result without shortening was readily\r\nobtained. I assume that the difference in character of these two\r\nfractures depended mainly on the rate of velocity with which the bullet\r\nwas travelling, since it passed fairly directly across the limb in each.\r\nI think it is clear, however, that the bullet struck the femur rather\r\nnearer the centre of the width of the shaft and therefore more directly,\r\nin the more severe injury.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the question of explosive exit wounds in the thigh. In\r\nspite of the great tendency to comminution of the shaft, these were rare\r\nin a severe form. This depended simply on the depth and thickness of the\r\ncoverings of the bone, and, as already mentioned, although the skin\r\nopenings were often comparatively small, a large cavity or area of\r\ndestroyed soft tissues may be contained within the limb. I do not think\r\nI ever saw an exit wound in the thigh exceeding 1-1/2 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe oblique fracture illustrated by plate XVI. has been already referred\r\nto, and the influence of the weight and movement of the trunk on its\r\nproduction has been considered.\r\n\r\nPlate XV. illustrates an obliquely comminuted fracture of another\r\ncharacter. The bullet has here been stripped of its mantle, which has\r\nundergone fragmentation, but the leaden core is little altered in shape.\r\nThis is of much interest, since it shows that the bullet struck the bone\r\nby its side. The effect of such lateral impact on the part of the\r\nprojectile is well shown: there is great bone comminution of a less\r\nregular character than usual, and the bullet is retained. Retention in\r\nthis case was probably not a result of low velocity of flight, but of\r\nthe increased resistance offered by the broad area of bone struck, and\r\nthe check exerted on the axial rotation of the bullet by the lateral\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(31_a_) THE FRACTURE SHOWN IN PLATE XII., SIX MONTHS AFTER RECEPTION OF\r\nTHE INJURY\r\n\r\nThe amount of callus furnished around the loose fragments is very\r\nstriking.\r\n\r\nThe upper end of the bone is shown to have been divided into at least\r\ntwo fragments, hence one of the difficulties of maintaining the ends in\r\napposition. The stoppage of the fissuring short of the epiphysis is\r\ncharacteristic.]\r\n\r\nSlighter injuries to the femur in which the shaft was chipped or grooved\r\nwithout loss of continuity were not uncommon, and showed well the\r\ncapacity of the bone to withstand the lateral shock transmitted by small\r\nbullets. Two figures inserted in the chapter on wounds in general (figs.\r\n22, 23, pp. 61, 62) are of cases in which, from the appearance of the\r\nwound of exit, the bullet probably underwent deformation, or was so\r\ndeflected as to escape on a considerably altered axis. Beyond the nature\r\nof the exit wound in the case depicted in fig. 22, some thickening\r\nbeneath the femoral vessels denoted bone injury, but unfortunately no\r\nskiagram was taken.\r\n\r\nI saw no case in which a transverse fracture of the shaft accompanied\r\nsuch injuries, but am under the impression that, if they had been\r\nproduced by bullets of greater volume and weight, transverse solution of\r\ncontinuity would have been more common. In point of fact, no case of\r\npure transverse fracture of the femur ever came under my notice.\r\n\r\nThe diagram depicted in fig. 51, p. 164, is from a sketch made of the\r\nlower end of a femur in which a severely comminuted fracture followed by\r\nsuppuration necessitated an amputation of the thigh, performed by Major\r\nLougheed, R.A.M.C. It is inserted as an illustration of the tendency of\r\nthe fissures to stop short above the actual articular extremities of the\r\nbones. In this case the comminution was extreme and accompanied by the\r\nusual long lateral fragments, one of which measured five inches in\r\nlength and might well have extended into the knee-joint had that been an\r\nordinary occurrence.\r\n\r\nPerforations of the lower extremity of the bone were very common. These\r\nwere sometimes transverse and limited to the articular extremity itself,\r\nor the same limitation occurred to the antero-posterior tracks. These\r\nwere the slightest forms of injury, putting on one side incomplete\r\ntunnels and grooves on the surface of the bone. With regard to the\r\nlatter, however, when they invaded the joint cavity the injury was\r\nliable to be more severe than a complete perforation, in consequence of\r\nthe projection of comminuted fragments into the joint cavity near the\r\nline of reflection of the synovial capsule and ulterior interference\r\nwith freedom of movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55_a_.--Diagram of 'Butterfly' type.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H.

The bone\r\nunited without shortening of the limb.]\r\n\r\nOther tracks took a direction of longitudinal obliquity, and then\r\nimplicated both epiphysis and diaphysis. Fig. 52, p. 169, shows an\r\nexample, and also the peculiarity likely to be assumed by the exit\r\naperture in the bone, especially if the bullet was travelling at a low\r\nrate of velocity, a considerable plate of the compact bone being driven\r\nout. In some cases these oblique tracks involved both femur and tibia.\r\nThey will be referred to again under the heading of injuries to the\r\njoints, and some remarks will also be found there regarding the synovial\r\neffusion so often occurring into the knee-joint in cases of fracture of\r\nthe shaft of the bone.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to insert here a few remarks as to the clinical\r\ncharacteristics of fractures of the femur. First with regard to the\r\nprimary signs and symptoms. A very considerable degree of general or\r\nconstitutional shock usually accompanied them, and this was perhaps more\r\nconstant than in the case of any other injury in the body. This was,\r\nmoreover, no doubt increased by the unfavourable conditions in which\r\npatients on the field of battle are situated in regard to transport.\r\nWhen the patients were brought into hospital some delay in the primary\r\ntreatment was often necessary until reaction took place. Local shock to\r\nthe part was also a prominent feature. Abnormal mobility was very free\r\nin the badly comminuted cases. Crepitus was often loose, and of 'the bag\r\nof bone' variety. The result of local shock and consequent flaccidity of\r\nthe muscles was to reduce the development of primary shortening; in some\r\ncases of severe comminution this was practically nil during the first\r\nday or two, when, with return of tone in the muscles, it sometimes\r\nbecame very considerable. Swelling of the limb was often very great, and\r\nvascular injury definitely far more common than in the fractures of\r\ncivil practice, in consequence, no doubt, not only of the number and\r\nsharpness of the fragments, but also of the force with which they were\r\ndriven into the surrounding tissues. The exit segment of the track was\r\nout of all proportion in size to the entry, as a result of the\r\npropulsion of bone fragments through it. This often made the closure of\r\nthe exit wound a very protracted event, the track continuing to\r\ndischarge a small quantity of bloody serum and fragments of necrosed\r\ntissue for many weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(33) COMMINUTED FRACTURE OF THE FEMUR\r\n\r\nRange 'short.'\r\n\r\nNormal entry wound of slightly oval form.\r\n\r\nOblique lateral impact on the part of the bullet, the mantle of which\r\nburst into numerous fragments. The bullet is seen to the inner side of\r\nthe shaft, almost devoid of its mantle, and little deformed at the tip.\r\nThe comminution of the upper portion of the fracture is very fine; the\r\nbullet has merely cut its way down the lower portion, and one or two\r\nlong fragments are separated. The skiagram shows well the result of\r\nlateral impact by the side of the bullet.\r\n\r\nCompare this plate with No. VI. as illustrating lesser resistance, and\r\nNo. VIII. as illustrating the effect of lower velocity.]\r\n\r\nIn a large proportion of the cases which were transported for any\r\ndistance suppuration occurred; this must have been the case in at least\r\n60 per cent. of the fractures. Suppuration was of the character already\r\ndescribed in the general section, affecting particularly the bone\r\nitself, and accompanied by very marked signs of general infection.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis in fractures of the femur._--As regards mortality fractures\r\nin the upper third of the bone proved one of the most formidable\r\ninjuries which came under treatment. Suppuration was common, at least 60\r\nper cent. of the wounds becoming infected. This depended on several\r\nreasons, often inseparable from the injuries, or from their treatment in\r\nField hospitals: such as (1) the exit wound being situated in the\r\ndangerous region of the thigh; (2) ineffective dressing and fixation;\r\n(3) the impossibility of ensuring primary cleansing and removal of\r\ndetached fragments of bone; (4) the necessity of the early transport of\r\npatients to the Stationary or Base hospitals, often for great distances;\r\n(5) the comparatively long period that often had to elapse before the\r\nopportunity of doing the first efficient dressing arrived.\r\n\r\nFractures in the middle and lower thirds of the bone were more easy to\r\ntreat successfully, but these also added to the list both of amputations\r\nand fatalities.\r\n\r\nPunctured fractures of the lower articular extremity were usually of\r\nlittle importance, as they progressed without exception, as far as my\r\nexperience went, favourably.\r\n\r\nI can give no idea of the general results obtained during the whole\r\ncampaign, but I am able to state the results of the fractures of the\r\nshaft treated at No. 1 General Hospital during my stay in South Africa.\r\nThirty-two cases of fracture of the shaft of the bone came under\r\ntreatment, and of these 6 or 18.7 per cent. needed amputation, and of\r\nthe whole number 5 or 15.6 per cent. died. To emphasise the satisfactory\r\nnature of these figures I need only quote the results attained in the\r\nAmerican War of the Rebellion; mortality in upper third, 46 per cent.;\r\nmiddle third, 40.6 per cent.; lower third, 38.2 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(34) OBLIQUE FRACTURE OF THE SHAFT OF THE FEMUR\r\n\r\nRange '300 to 400 yards.'\r\n\r\nAperture of entry just above the centre of the outer aspect of the\r\nthigh. Exit, about 2 inches lower, at the junction of the inner and\r\nposterior aspects. The bullet was retained just within the wound, and\r\nwhen removed the mantle fell off in two parts. The leaden core was\r\nmushroomed. The bullet had passed through another soldier previous to\r\nentering the patient's thigh. Only two small fragments of the mantle\r\nwere retained, as seen in the skiagram. These were in the substance of\r\nthe great sciatic nerve, and were subsequently removed by Sir Thomas\r\nSmith.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine how the bone was struck; reference to plate\r\nXXI. would suggest that the shaft may have been perforated, but no\r\nevidence of this remains in the skiagram taken, which was five months\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe patient was standing at the moment of reception of the injury, and\r\nthe obliquity of the fracture no doubt depended on his fall and the\r\nresulting influence of the weight of the body. The length of the\r\nfracture cleft was 9 inches.]\r\n\r\nI need hardly dwell upon the difference between the nature of the\r\ninjuries received in the American War of the Rebellion and in the\r\npresent campaign, as in the former the old large bullets were employed,\r\nand shell injuries are possibly included; but I ought to add in this\r\nrelation, that the numbers quoted from No. 1 General Hospital included,\r\nto my knowledge, at least three severe Martini-Henry wounds.\r\n\r\nThe first element for a favourable prognosis is a small wound, and\r\nopportunity for an efficient primary treatment of the same; the second\r\nthe absence of necessity for transport of the patient. With regard to\r\nthe second of these requirements, we were unfortunately situated in\r\nSouth Africa, and the majority of the cases which did badly were moved\r\nduring the first few days and for a distance of between five and six\r\nhundred miles. On the other hand, as a rule, the external wounds were\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nAs to functional result, the fractures did well. I think an average of\r\nan inch and a half would well cover the shortening, and in many the\r\nlength was little altered. Considering the serious nature of many of\r\nthese fractures, this was good.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In all punctured fractures of the lower extremity,\r\ndressing of the wounds like uncomplicated ones and a short period of\r\nimmobilisation were all that was necessary. In oblique fractures, and\r\nthose with slight comminution, closure of the wound by dressings, after\r\nit had been carefully cleansed, was all that was necessary prior to\r\napplying the splints for immobilisation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd. (35) PERFORATION OF\r\nTHE SHAFT OF THE FEMUR.

In these, after\r\ncareful preliminary cleansing of the limb, the wounds, especially the\r\nexit aperture, needed exploration and, if necessary, enlargement, and\r\nall free splinters needed removal. If interference with the entry wound\r\ncould be avoided, this was always preferable, as it was rare for this\r\nnot to heal by primary union unless free suppuration occurred. Under\r\nField hospital conditions I think the exit wound should never be\r\nsutured, whatever its situation; and in the present campaign, where\r\ncarbolic acid lotion was freely used, this step was manifestly\r\ninadvisable, in view of the abundant serous discharge always to be\r\nexpected when this disinfectant has been employed. Except in cases\r\nmanifestly infected at the time of exploration, the use of drainage\r\ntubes or plugs is not to be recommended. I would point out also that in\r\nthe majority of cases it is quite hopeless to attempt to make the entry\r\nwound the safety-valve for drainage, as its natural tendency, even if\r\nenlarged, is to heal, while the condition of the tissues in the exit\r\nsegment of the track usually renders primary union an impossibility.\r\n\r\nThe wound having been dealt with, the next indications were for the\r\nreduction of deformity, immobilisation of the limb, and the provision of\r\na proper degree of extension. As to the reduction of the fracture, this\r\nwas always a matter of ease, needing only slight axis traction. The\r\nprovision of efficient means of extension and immobilisation was a very\r\ndifferent matter. These questions had to be considered under two sets of\r\nconditions: (1) when it was possible to keep the patient at rest in the\r\nhospital he was first deposited in; (2) when it was necessary for him to\r\nbe transported for a considerable distance, probably not less than 500\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nWhen transport is a necessity, the best method of immobilisation is the\r\napplication of breeches of plaster of Paris, and a long outside splint.\r\nThe latter we often had excellently made on emergency by the Ordnance\r\nDepartment or the Royal Engineers. A perineal band is the only form of\r\nextension possible under these circumstances. The Dutch ambulances were\r\nprovided with a very excellent emergency splint for cases of fractured\r\nthigh, which is illustrated in fig. 56. I think something of this kind\r\nshould be carried in one of the ambulances going on to every field of\r\nbattle, as being far more suitable than a long outside splint for hasty\r\nand inaccurate application. This splint, fixed with some kind of firm\r\nbandage, is an excellent temporary one for use during transport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H.

(Dutch Ambulance, Winberg)]\r\n\r\nIn cases which can be treated at a Stationary hospital near at hand, a\r\nlong outside splint supplemented by plaster breeches, and a well-applied\r\nAmerican extension, is a very good method of treatment, the only point\r\nto bear in mind being frequent examination of the position of the limb\r\nto ensure the extension being efficient. As already mentioned, the\r\nshortening in the primary stages is often slight and easily combated,\r\nbut in many of these cases if examined in a few days the limbs are found\r\nto have shortened considerably, principally as a result of recovery of\r\ntone by the muscles, and the absence of any help from the resting of the\r\ntwo fragments end to end. The weight, therefore, has often to be\r\nprogressively increased and the fracture readjusted if necessary.\r\nAlthough this method of treatment is satisfactory in cases with a small\r\nwound, it is very troublesome to carry out, even when a bracket is\r\ninserted opposite the wound, when frequent dressing is necessary, as is\r\ngenerally at first the case when the wounds are large. For this purpose\r\na much more satisfactory method is the use of Hodgen's splint. This\r\nallows of automatic adjustment of the degree of extension, and the\r\ndressing of the wound without interference with the position of the\r\nfracture. A continuous many-tailed bag is preferable to the strips\r\nusually employed for the suspension of the limb, as more easily\r\nadjustable and as offering a more even support to the limb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson Ltd.\r\n\r\n(37) OBLIQUE COMMINUTED FRACTURE OF THE TIBIA\r\n\r\nRange '600 yards.'\r\n\r\nThe entrance wound was large and the exit also. The fracture may have\r\nbeen caused by a Mannlicher (8 mm.) soft-nosed bullet, or possibly a\r\nricochet. The fragmentation is somewhat coarse at the periphery, but\r\nvery fine in the track of the bullet. Several fragments of the mantle\r\nare visible.\r\n\r\nThe fracture affords a good example of obliquity due to cutting by the\r\nbullet, and contrasts well with those due to rectangular impact such as\r\nare shown in plates IV. and XIV.]\r\n\r\nWhile at Orange River, in conjunction with Major Knaggs, R.A.M.C., and\r\nMr. Langmore, we treated several cases of fracture of the shaft of the\r\nfemur by this method. The splints were made for us by the Ordnance\r\nDepartment, while the Royal Engineers erected a kind of gallows for us\r\ndown the centre of a commissariat marquee in order to avoid the risk of\r\nusing the tent poles for suspension. The patients were then ranged on\r\neach side of the tent in two rows so that the pull of the two sets of\r\nlimbs opposed each other on the gallows from which they were suspended.\r\nAlthough these patients had to lie on the ground, they were really\r\ncomfortable compared with those treated with long outside splints, and\r\nthe results obtained were very good: in three cases which I had the\r\nopportunity of measuring later the bones were in good position and the\r\nshortening was less than one inch.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt whatever that Hodgen's splint is by far the best method\r\nof treating all cases of fractured thigh in the Stationary field\r\nhospitals; and, more than this, I believe it is the only practicable and\r\nefficient one. It can be applied without the use of an anaesthetic\r\nwithout causing undue suffering to the patient, it allows of ready\r\nchange of the dressing, it is comfortable and permits considerable range\r\nof movement on the part of the patient, it is as efficient with patients\r\nlying on the ground as in a bed, it keeps the limb in good position and\r\nallows of constant inspection on this point, and it is the only method\r\nwhich provides satisfactory extension without constant readjustment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H.

The\r\nbullet crossed and grooved the posterior aspect of the tibia, but struck\r\nthe fibula full. This is the only instance of a transverse cleft which\r\ncame under my notice.\r\n\r\nThe wound suppurated, and a number of fragments of the fibula needed\r\nremoval; hence the amount of callus present.]\r\n\r\nCases in which operative fixation is indicated are rare, but a few\r\noblique fractures may be treated with advantage in this manner if the\r\nconditions surrounding the patient admit of it. Screwing is generally\r\npreferable to wiring.\r\n\r\nLastly, we come to the cases in which primary amputation is necessary. I\r\nmay say at once that I saw no case of wound from a bullet of small\r\ncalibre in which this was indicated, and only one shell injury in which\r\nit was performed. I believe with small bullets that injury to the main\r\nblood-vessels is almost the only indication which is likely to be met\r\nwith, and this by no means always indicates an amputation. First of all\r\nthe question arises as to whether the wound in the vessel is caused by a\r\nbone fragment or by the bullet itself; reference to the chapter on\r\nblood-vessels would seem to prove that a bullet wound is by no means a\r\nnecessary indication for amputation. Given favourable conditions, it\r\nmight be treated locally by ligature at the time, while if haemorrhage is\r\nnot proceeding, developments should be awaited before proceeding to\r\namputation. In the case of bone fragment punctures, secondary haemorrhage\r\nis a more likely indication for amputation than primary.\r\n\r\nBroadly, it may be laid down that very extensive injury to the soft\r\nparts is the only indication for primary amputation beyond primary\r\nhaemorrhage, and it may be added that the condition is rare with wounds\r\nfrom small-calibre bullets. If a primary amputation is necessary the\r\nobservations as to the transport of fractured thighs are equally\r\napplicable. I never saw a primary amputation do well that was moved\r\nduring the first week; sloughing of flaps or haemorrhage followed as a\r\nrule, and often death.\r\n\r\nIntermediate amputations were indicated in cases of septic infection and\r\nthose of haemorrhage; they seldom did well, and should be avoided if\r\npossible. Secondary amputations for sepsis or haemorrhage were attended\r\nby fair results, but I can give no statistics. Unless extensive\r\nosteo-myelitis is evident, or very widespread cellulitis of the limb\r\nexists, I am strongly of opinion that the amputations when the fractures\r\nare above the middle of the thigh should be through the fracture, and\r\nnot at the hip-joint, even if a subsequent secondary operation is\r\nrisked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(39) PERFORATION OF THE SHAFT OF THE TIBIA, AND INCOMPLETE OBLIQUE\r\nFISSURE EXTENDING FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE OPENING TO THE CREST OF THE\r\nBONE.\r\n\r\nRange medium. Entry and exit wounds at same level.\r\n\r\nThe patient was standing when struck, and fell backwards, his rifle\r\nfalling at the same time and striking the shin. The fibula is intact.\r\n\r\nThe perforation indicated by the well-marked translucent spot is small.\r\n\r\nThe forking of the lower extremity of the cleft suggests the starting of\r\nthe fissure from above. The fissure comes to the surface at the seat of\r\nelection, but its position may possibly have been determined by the blow\r\nfrom the falling rifle.\r\n\r\nThe backward fall of the patient clearly explains the mechanism of\r\nproduction of the fissure, and throws light on the production of an\r\noblique fracture such as shown in plate XVI.]\r\n\r\n_Fractures of the patella._--Punctured fractures of the patella were\r\ncommon with direct impact of the bullet; these were often difficult to\r\npalpate, and were only to be certainly diagnosed by attention to the\r\ndirection of the track, and the development of haemarthrosis. I saw at\r\nleast three or four in which the bullet, in addition to traversing the\r\nknee-joint, injured the popliteal vessels. I have notes of one case in\r\nwhich a bullet traversed the soft parts from above downwards and scored\r\na vertical groove on the surface of the patella; this was readily\r\npalpable, but produced no solution of continuity. In several cases the\r\nmargin of the patella was notched by a passing bullet.\r\n\r\nI never saw a case of stellate fracture, and by this my experience in\r\nthe case of the ilium was confirmed.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions I saw pure transverse fractures of the bone; in each\r\nthe wound was produced by a Lee-Metford bullet. This is of some interest\r\nas denoting that the greater volume and weight, in conjunction with the\r\nblunter tip, of the Lee-Metford may produce more severe injury to the\r\nbones than the Mauser. I believe this to be the case, given an equal\r\ndegree of velocity on the part of the bullet at the moment of impact;\r\nbut it is probable that the position of the patella with regard to the\r\ncondyles of the femur when struck is of far greater importance in\r\nrelation to the production of transverse fractures. The skiagram\r\nrepresented in plate XVIII. shows an obliquely transverse fracture,\r\nwhich in this instance resulted from a crossing bullet, which grooved\r\nthe surface of the bone.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the two cases of transverse fracture above referred to, I\r\nmay add that one occurred in a youth under twenty, and a good result was\r\nobtained by treatment with splints, and later by massage. In the second\r\nthe patient was a man over fifty, who had received other injuries. The\r\nwound over the patella healed and some union had occurred, when the\r\npatient fell and burst both the bone union and the skin cicatrix.\r\nSecondary suppuration of the knee-joint, necessitating an amputation of\r\nthe thigh, followed, but the patient made a good recovery. The third\r\ncase also did well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXII.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.

Compare\r\nwith figs. 51 and 57 in the text.]\r\n\r\nThe treatment of these injuries differed in no way from that adopted in\r\ncivil practice, given satisfactory surroundings. Suture might be\r\nindicated in some cases of transverse fracture, but this would only be\r\nnecessary if the fragments were widely separated. The punctured\r\nfractures needed treatment as for simple wounds, combined with a short\r\nperiod of rest and pressure for the condition of haemarthrosis. It was\r\nimportant not to prolong the period of rest beyond a week or ten days if\r\nthe effusion was slight, in view of possible ulterior interference with\r\nrange of movement in the knee-joint.\r\n\r\n_Fractures of the tibia._--Some remarks have already been made regarding\r\nfractures of the head of the tibia, and the importance of the\r\noverhanging prominent margins in the production of somewhat irregular\r\ninjuries (p. 170). Putting these peculiarities on one side, the\r\ncancellous ends are subject to the type forms of injury; thus\r\nperforations either of the head of the bone or the malleolus were common\r\ninjuries. The fractures of the shaft also deviated from the type in so\r\nfar as the broad flat surfaces in the upper two thirds of the bone\r\nrendered it especially liable to the results of lateral impact, and to\r\nthe production of the extreme wedge-shaped types of fracture. Plate\r\nXXII. illustrates the different result of a bullet striking the dense\r\nand strong spine at a low rate of velocity, a notch only resulting. If,\r\non the other hand, the lateral surfaces were struck, a wedge with the\r\nbase corresponding to the posterior surface was the most common injury,\r\nthe spine in many cases remaining intact and maintaining the continuity\r\nof the bone. Wedge-shaped fractures of this bone were apt to show\r\nmultiple secondary wave fissures concentric with the main line, and\r\nconsequently free comminution. I saw several examples, the loose\r\nfragments being remarkably numerous. Plate XIX. is an example of an\r\noblique fracture produced by a bullet which has ploughed across the\r\nbone, displacing large fragments anteriorly, but finely comminuting the\r\nbone in its course, and leaving small fragments of the mantle on its\r\nway. Plate XX. is an example of the rare condition of transverse\r\nfracture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(41) SPURIOUS PERFORATION OF THE FIBULA\r\n\r\nModerate range, 'about 1,000 yards.'\r\n\r\nThe injury was caused by an 8 mm. bullet, which entered base foremost\r\nand lodged in the calf. The fracture is really an incomplete stellate\r\nform, two well-marked transverse fissures extending from the point\r\nstruck. The position of the bullet suggests its entry into the limb base\r\nforemost, and as it is retained low velocity may be assumed.]\r\n\r\nThis fracture was produced by a bullet travelling at a high rate of\r\nvelocity, which struck the posterior surface of the tibia, and caused a\r\ngrooving, accompanied by a horizontal fissure through the whole\r\nthickness of the bone; later it struck the fibula more directly, and\r\nproduced an ordinary comminuted fracture two inches above the malleolus.\r\nPerforations of the shaft were far more common than in the case of the\r\nfemur, and I saw them in every part of the length of the bone (plate\r\nXXI.). Fig. 57 illustrates a form of peculiar interest as showing the\r\ngradual transition of the tunnel to the groove, and also as bringing\r\nfractures of the long bones into line with such fractures of the flat\r\nbones of the skull as are depicted in fig. 68.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--(42) Perforation of lower third of Tibia,\r\nshowing lifting and fissuring of the compact roof of the tunnel. Compare\r\nwith fig. 68, p. 259, of a fracture of the cranial vault.]\r\n\r\n_Fractures of the fibula_ offered no special features of importance. Any\r\nform might occur. The plate No. XXIII. is of interest as showing a\r\nspurious form of perforation, and also the primary form of displacement\r\nof the fragments in stellate fractures. It was produced by a reversed\r\nricochet, but undeformed, bullet, still seen in position in the\r\nskiagram; the bullet only possessed sufficient force to perforate the\r\nbone, and then appears to have turned on its transverse axis. The\r\nfollowing plate, No. XXIV., is inserted to show the depth at which the\r\nbullet lay, and its distance from the surface of the tibia, which\r\nappears in the first plate to be nil. It is also of interest as showing\r\nthe ease with which a false impression may be obtained from a single\r\npicture, as, beyond a spot of transparency, no obvious injury to the\r\nfibula, and certainly no displacement, is discernible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV.\r\n\r\nSkiagram by H. CATLING.\r\n\r\nEngraved and Printed by Bale and Danielsson, Ltd.\r\n\r\n(41_a_) This skiagram is inserted to show the depth at which the bullet\r\nlay from the surface. It is also interesting to note the insignificance\r\nof the fracture of the fibula from this aspect. Without the second\r\nskiagram the injury might have passed for a simple perforation or a\r\ntransverse fracture.]\r\n\r\nFractures of the bones of the leg possessed an unenviable degree of\r\nimportance. First, on account of the very severe injuries to the soft\r\nparts that often accompanied them, without an apparently correspondingly\r\nserious damage to the bone. Secondly, on account of the frequency with\r\nwhich the vessels were implicated in these injuries to the soft parts,\r\neither by the bullet or bone fragments. Beyond this, fracture of either\r\narticular end of the tibia was certainly more frequently followed by\r\ntroublesome joint complications than occurred in the case of any other\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of 'explosive' injuries, I think more were seen in the\r\ncalf of the leg than in any other part of the body, and this often\r\nwithout solution of continuity of the bones, and sometimes without\r\nevidence even of contact of the bullet with either tibia or fibula. Some\r\nremarks on this subject have already been made in the chapter on wounds\r\nin general, and some sources of fallacy exposed. I believe that in\r\npractically all these so-called explosive injuries the wound was either\r\ncaused by a ricochet, or a bullet which deformed with great ease on bony\r\ncontact during its progress through the limb. A considerable number of\r\nthe wounds which were referred by the men to the use of expanding\r\nbullets were probably the result of the use of Martini-Henry or large\r\nleaden sporting bullets, and evidence of this was often forthcoming on\r\nexamination of the entry wounds. In other cases the irregularity of the\r\nopening plainly pointed to ricochet of a small bullet as the explanation\r\nof the character of the injury. The greater frequency of ricochet\r\ninjuries in the leg and foot when the men were standing is readily\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nConcurrent injury to the vessels of the leg was common, but primary\r\nhaemorrhage, as was the case generally, usually ceased spontaneously. The\r\nimportance of injury to the vessels was rather in view of secondary\r\nhaemorrhage, which occurred with some frequency, and I think more\r\ncommonly from the anterior than the posterior tibial vessels, usually\r\noccurring at the end of a week or ten days, and naturally most\r\nfrequently in cases which suppurated.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis and treatment in fractures of the leg._--In fractures of the\r\nleg, except those of extreme severity, almost any form of splint\r\nsufficed to maintain the bones in position, but for field purposes the\r\nDutch cane splint (fig. 58, p. 222) was certainly very convenient. For\r\nlater use in cases that needed frequent dressing, a wooden back splint,\r\nwith a foot-piece, or, if obtainable, a Neville's splint with a\r\nsuspension cradle, was the best. Where the wounds were small and\r\nfrequent dressing was not required, nothing was so good as plaster of\r\nParis, especially when transport was a necessity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Dutch Cane Field Emergency Splint for Leg]\r\n\r\nIn cases with large wounds suppuration was very frequent, and in\r\nconnection with this secondary haemorrhage, or in the case of fractures\r\nnear the articular ends, especially the upper, joint suppuration. The\r\ntreatment of these cases varied: in many an amputation was the best or\r\nonly treatment advisable; but I several times saw good results follow\r\nligation of the anterior tibial artery for secondary haemorrhage, even\r\nwhen suppuration existed, and occasional good results after incision\r\nand drainage of joints if the infection was not of the most acute form.\r\n\r\nPrimary amputation was rarely needed for any case of injury from a\r\nbullet of small calibre, since it was only necessary either in the case\r\nof injury to both main arteries, and this was rare, or in cases of very\r\nextensive injury to the soft parts. I saw many of the latter make fair\r\nresults when treated conservatively, even though the condition seemed\r\nalmost hopeless at first sight. All the primary amputations that I saw\r\nwere either for shell or large bullet injuries. A word may be inserted\r\nhere as to the weight that ought to attach to nerve injuries in this\r\nrelation. From the experience gained elsewhere it is clear that we\r\nshould attach little importance to these unless the divided nerves are\r\nactually in sight, as far as deciding on amputation is concerned. On the\r\nother hand, there is little doubt that the presence of concurrent nerve\r\ninjury, be it only concussion or contusion, exerts an important ulterior\r\ninfluence on the healing of the wound, whether the part be amputated or\r\nnot. Amputation flaps in such cases possess a very considerably lowered\r\ndegree of vitality.\r\n\r\nSecondary amputations were often needed for sepsis, and on the whole did\r\nvery well; both for the same cause and for haemorrhage intermediate\r\namputations had occasionally to be performed; the results of these, as\r\nelsewhere, were bad.\r\n\r\n_Fractures of the tarsus._--Wounds of these short bones were as a rule\r\nof slight importance, given fairly direct impact on the part of the\r\nbullet. They then consisted of either simple perforations or surface\r\ngrooving. A single bone might be implicated or several might be\r\ntunnelled; in the latter case the implication of the joints very\r\nconsiderably influenced the prognosis, since the addition of the joint\r\ninjury caused much more prolonged weakening of the foot.\r\n\r\nWounds of the foot were common from the fact that when the men lay out\r\nin the prone position, the foot was often the part least protected by\r\nthe cover chosen, and particularly the heel. In these circumstances the\r\nos calcis was the bone most frequently implicated, and that by tracks\r\ntaking an oblique course downwards from the leg to the sole. Again the\r\nfoot was often struck by ricochet bullets, as a result of its position\r\nwhen the erect attitude was assumed. The latter fact was of much\r\nimportance with regard to the nature of the injury sustained by the\r\nbones, as under these circumstances the mode of impact was irregular,\r\nand consequently comminution was often produced.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the different bones of the tarsus varied somewhat. On\r\nthe whole the prognosis in cases of injury to the os calcis was the\r\nbest, since the injury was more often individual and did not implicate\r\nany joint, and also because of the comparatively regular architecture of\r\nthe bone. In the smaller bones concurrent injury to a joint was more\r\nfrequent. In the astragalus the central hard core extending upwards from\r\nthe interosseous groove, as increasing resistance, I think accounted for\r\nthe fact that comminution was more marked in this bone than in any\r\nother. The effect of wound of bones of the tarsus in producing a certain\r\ndegree of laxity in the mediotarsal joint resulting in a slightly flexed\r\nposition of the fore part of the foot and some projection of the head of\r\nthe astragalus did not seem to me easy of explanation, but it occurred\r\nwith some regularity.\r\n\r\nThe injuries to the _metatarsus_ corresponded so nearly to those already\r\nspoken of in the case of the metacarpus that they need no further\r\nmention. They were less common, however, and I am under the impression\r\nthat fragmentation of the bullet was not such a marked feature, probably\r\non account of the lower degree of density of the bones, and their\r\ngreater fixity of position.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Col. W. F. Stevenson. _Loc. cit._ p. 69.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE JOINTS\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil recent times gunshot injuries of the joints formed a class\r\nentailing the gravest anxiety to the surgeon, both in regard to the\r\nselection of primary measures of treatment and in the conduct of the\r\nafter progress of the cases. The external wounds were severe,\r\ncomminution of the bones was great, and retention of the bullet within\r\nthe articulation was not uncommon. Operative surgery therefore found a\r\nlarge field in the extraction of bullets, removal of bone fragments,\r\nexcision of the joints, or even amputation of the limbs.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of bullets of small calibre has robbed these injuries\r\nof much of the importance they possessed in earlier days and during the\r\npresent campaign direct clean wounds of the joints were little more to\r\nbe dreaded than uncomplicated wounds of the soft parts alone. No more\r\nstriking evidence of the aseptic nature of the wounds, and the harmless\r\ncharacter of the projectile as a possible infecting agent, than that\r\noffered by the general course of these injuries in this campaign, is to\r\nbe found in the whole range of military surgery.\r\n\r\nThe aseptic nature of the wounds, and the slight and localised character\r\nof the bone lesions, have in fact justified the opinion previously\r\nexpressed by Von Coler, that these injuries in the future would be less\r\nfeared than fractures of the diaphyses of the bones.\r\n\r\nNot less important than the localised character of the bone lesion\r\nitself is the fact that the accompanying wounds of the soft parts retain\r\nthe small or type forms. Thus I occasionally observed more troublesome\r\nresults from minor shell wounds in the neighbourhood of joints, but not\r\nimplicating the synovial cavity, than in actual perforating injuries\r\nproduced by bullets of small calibre.\r\n\r\n_Vibration synovitis._--Before proceeding to the consideration of wounds\r\nof the joints, a short account is necessary of a condition of some\r\nimportance which is, I believe, more or less special to injuries from\r\nbullets of small calibre travelling at high rates of velocity. This\r\ncondition, if not novel, at any rate excited little comment in the\r\ndescriptions of the older forms of injury, although this may have\r\ndepended on the more serious nature of the primary local lesions\r\naccompanying wounds from the larger bullets, among which it formed a\r\ncomparatively unimportant element.\r\n\r\nThe condition referred to was the occurrence of considerable synovial\r\neffusion into the joints of limbs in which the articulation itself was\r\nprimarily untouched. These effusions sometimes occurred even when the\r\nsoft parts alone were perforated, especially when the wounds were\r\nsituated above or below the knee-joint. They were apparently the direct\r\nresult of vibratory concussion of the entire limb dependent on the blow\r\nreceived from the bullet.\r\n\r\nThe effusions were most strongly marked in cases of fractures of the\r\ndiaphyses, although this was more noticeable in some situations than\r\nothers. Thus with fractures of the shaft of the femur anywhere below the\r\njunction of the upper and middle thirds of the bone, and in some cases\r\neven higher, effusion into the knee-joint was very common, and sometimes\r\nextreme. On the other hand, similar effusions into the hip-joint were\r\nless marked, since I failed to determine their existence in the majority\r\nof cases. I am inclined to ascribe this to the different anatomical\r\narrangement of the two joints, particularly to the fact that the head of\r\nthe femur is included in a bony cup, into the hollow of which it is\r\naccurately fixed by the resilient cotyloid fibro-cartilage. The latter\r\nby its firm grasp of the head allows of little play in the joint; hence\r\nvibrations are conveyed directly to the acetabulum in continuous waves,\r\nand rocking of the articular surfaces is prevented. Beyond this no doubt\r\nthe difficulty of detecting small effusions in this joint is an element\r\nwhich must be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nI do not think that wrenches of the knee-joint in the act of falling\r\ncan be suggested as an explanation of the frequency of effusions into\r\nthat articulation, since the fractures of the femur were not always\r\nreceived while the erect position was maintained, and effusion was most\r\nmarked when the diaphysis was the part affected, the latter point\r\nillustrating the greater resistance offered by compact bone. Again, when\r\nfracture had taken place, the solution of continuity rendered the\r\ndirectly injured point the most mobile, and tended to prevent lateral\r\nstrain from falling on the joints.\r\n\r\nEffusion into the knee or ankle, or sometimes both joints, was common in\r\nfractures of the shaft of the tibia.\r\n\r\nIn the articulations of the upper extremity the condition was also\r\ncommon, but somewhat less marked than in the lower limb. Effusions into\r\nthe shoulder or elbow occurred. In the former these were less striking;\r\nagain, perhaps, as a result of the difficulty of detecting small\r\neffusions in this situation. The elbow was to a certain extent protected\r\nby the possession of a degree of fixity somewhat resembling that already\r\nmentioned in the case of the hip-joint, although here depending on the\r\nconformation of the bones alone. I think this explained the absence of\r\nfree effusion in many cases of fracture of the humeral shaft, but when\r\nthe latter affected the lower third effusion into the elbow was usually\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nThe lighter weight and greater mobility of the upper extremity as a\r\nwhole, as decreasing the resistance to the bullet, were also probably an\r\nelement in the fact that these effusions were less severe than those in\r\nthe joints of the lower limb.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the effusions was apparently simple, since they were\r\nrapidly reabsorbed, and little thickening of the synovial membrane\r\nremained to suggest either a marked degree of inflammation, or the\r\ndeposition of blood-clot on the inner aspect of the same.\r\n\r\nThe only treatment indicated was a short period of rest, accompanied in\r\nthe early stages by pressure and slight fixation, followed later by\r\nmassage and movement if necessary.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing this subject, I should like to particularly emphasise\r\nthe fact, that in the cases described there was no reason to suspect the\r\nextension of fissures from the point of fracture in the shafts into the\r\narticular ends of the bones. This was as far as possible excluded by\r\nclinical examination, and in the cases where wounds of the soft parts\r\nonly were present, the rapid return of the patients to active duty, with\r\nabsence of remaining joint trouble, negatived the possibility of such\r\nfractures.\r\n\r\nI only saw one case in which a longitudinal fracture actually extended\r\nfor any considerable distance into a neighbouring joint. In this a\r\ncomminuted fracture occurred just above the centre of the shaft of the\r\nhumerus. At the time of examination and putting up of the fracture there\r\nwas considerable swelling of the whole arm, and nothing special was\r\nnoticed about the shoulder-joint. Three weeks later, however, when the\r\nfracture was consolidating, difficulty in abduction of the shoulder was\r\nnoted, and the arm could not be placed closely in contact with the\r\ntrunk. There was no evident displacement of the head of the humerus\r\nforwards. A skiagram, which I much regret I have not been able to\r\ninsert, showed that a longitudinal fissure extended from the seat of\r\nfracture upwards in such a manner as to divide the upper fragment into\r\ntwo parts, of which the outer bore the greater tuberosity, the inner the\r\narticular surface of the head. The latter fragment had become somewhat\r\ndisplaced downwards, and had united in such a manner that the head\r\nrested on the lower part of the glenoid cavity. Abduction of the limb\r\ntherefore brought the greater tuberosity into contact with the acromion\r\nprocess, and movement was checked. This case passed out of my\r\nobservation shortly afterwards, and I have no knowledge of the final\r\nresult as to movement.\r\n\r\nFractures of the bony processes surrounding the elbow-joint, and of the\r\nmalleoli of the tibia and fibula, were not infrequent, but offered no\r\nspecial features.\r\n\r\nOne other form of injury indirectly affecting the joints is perhaps\r\nworthy of mention, but I observed it only once, and that in the case of\r\nthe shoulder, the only joint where it is likely to be marked. I refer to\r\nthe displacement of the head of the humerus by the force of gravity,\r\nwhen the circumflex nerve is injured. In the instance I refer to, a\r\nfracture of the surgical neck of the humerus was accompanied by\r\ncomplete motor paralysis of the deltoid and very rapid wasting of the\r\nmuscle. Circumflex sensation was impaired, but not absent at the time\r\nthe condition of the muscle was noted--a favourable prognostic sign of\r\nmuch importance. At the end of five weeks, when the fracture of the bone\r\nwas consolidated, the head of the humerus had dropped vertically at\r\nleast an inch, but could be replaced with ease. Shortly afterwards an\r\nimprovement in the condition of the muscle commenced, and with this the\r\nhead of the humerus was gradually raised. This patient later recovered\r\nhis power in great part, but not completely.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases bullets lodged in the neighbourhood of joints in such\r\npositions as to limit movement by mechanical impact with the bones. Thus\r\nI saw one case in which a bullet lay between the radius and ulna just\r\nbelow the lesser sigmoid cavity; in another the bullet lay in front of\r\nthe ankle-joint, and limited the possibility of flexion; and in a case\r\nrelated to me by Mr. Bowlby, a bullet was removed by him from the wall\r\nof the acetabulum where it was tightly fixed in the substance of the\r\nbone. In two other cases I saw bullets lying deeply on the anterior\r\nsurface of the hip capsule and so limiting flexion. In all such cases\r\nthe indication for removal of the bullet was sufficiently strongly\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE JOINTS\r\n\r\nThese may be divided into several classes, varying much in comparative\r\nseverity, and in prognostic importance.\r\n\r\n1. The comparatively rare instances in which a wound implicated a joint\r\ncavity, without accompanying lesion of any bone.\r\n\r\n2. Perforating wounds in which the bullet was retained within the\r\narticular cavity. These were also rare.\r\n\r\n3. Wounds of the joints accompanied by grooving of the articular\r\nextremities of the bones.\r\n\r\n4. Complete perforating tracks through the articular ends of the bones,\r\ncrossing the joint cavity in various directions.\r\n\r\n5. Comminuted fractures of the terminal parts of the diaphyses extending\r\ninto joints.\r\n\r\nOf these several classes, the first was of the least prognostic\r\nimportance. In the absence of bone injury the wounds usually healed\r\nwithout any obvious ill effect beyond the transient effusion into the\r\njoints of a mixture of blood and synovial fluid. When suppuration of the\r\nwound in the soft parts occurred, however, the remarks made as to the\r\ninjuries classed under the third heading also apply here in a lesser\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the retention of the bullet, in the case of bullets of\r\nsmall calibre this was a distinctly rare occurrence. I never happened to\r\nsee an instance of retention of either a Mauser or Lee-Metford bullet in\r\nan articulation. It is only possible with bullets practically spent, or\r\ntravelling at a very low rate of velocity and making irregular impact.\r\n\r\nThe influence of both volume and velocity of flight was well illustrated\r\nby my own small experience of retained bullets. In one case a\r\nMartini-Henry was found impacted between the femoral condyles, having\r\nslipped in beneath the margin of the patella. It caused a semiflexed\r\nposition to be assumed by the joint, and was removed by Mr. Brown in No.\r\n1 General Hospital at Wynberg. The second instance I saw in the Portland\r\nHospital at Bloemfontein in a patient of Mr. Bowlby's. The bullet was a\r\nGuedes, a form which has been already described as possessing low\r\nvelocity and deficient power of penetration; beyond this, in the\r\nparticular instance irregular impact was evidenced by the presence of a\r\nlarge irregular contused wound of entry over the tuberosity of the\r\ntibia.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the bullet in the knee-joint was later determined by the\r\nX-rays, and Mr. Bowlby removed it successfully. Seven months later the\r\nrange of movement was nearly normal.\r\n\r\nI may add that I saw several instances of large leaden bullets lodging\r\nin the popliteal space, and a comparatively insignificant number of\r\nbullets of small calibre in the same situation. This was very striking,\r\nin view of the immense relative frequency of use of the latter forms.\r\nThere is no doubt, moreover, that small bullets rarely lodge even in the\r\nneighbourhood of joints, unless at the distal end of a long track. To\r\ntake the extreme example of large bullets, those employed as shrapnel,\r\nin comparison with the frequency with which wounds were produced by\r\nthem, bullets lying at the bottom of short tracks in the neighbourhood\r\nof joints were not uncommon. Thus I saw one lying over the hip-joint,\r\nand another in close proximity to the shoulder capsule.\r\n\r\nWounds of the third class, where the bones had been superficially\r\ngrooved, were in some respects the most serious. This was especially so\r\nin the knee and ankle joints, and some cases will be quoted later under\r\nthe heading of the special joints to illustrate this point. Danger only\r\narose in the event of suppuration; and here the presence of the long\r\noblique superficial track in a neighbourhood liable to comparatively\r\nfree movement was the important element. Such tracks usually opened the\r\nsynovial sac more extensively than direct perforating wounds, and if\r\nsuppuration occurred in any portion of the track, the pus was very\r\nliable to be sucked into the joint on any free movement. The presence of\r\nfine splinters of the bone displaced in the production of the groove was\r\nalso a special character of wounds of this class. Another point worthy\r\nof mention is that in these cases it was not always easy to be quite\r\ncertain whether the joint cavity had been implicated or not, since cases\r\noften occurred in which, although the bones had been grooved, the joint\r\ncavity escaped. The indication, however, was to consider any wound in\r\nthe immediate proximity of a joint as perforating until it was healed.\r\nThis course was the more easy to take, since a large proportion of such\r\nwounds were accompanied by some degree of synovial effusion, even when\r\nthe neighbouring joint had escaped puncture.\r\n\r\nWounds of the fourth class, although the most highly characteristic of\r\nthe form of accident, were in many instances the most favourable in\r\nregard to their course. The tracks might course directly across the\r\njoint in any direction, or they might course obliquely, traversing\r\neither one or both the component bones. In the latter case the exit\r\nmight be in the diaphysis, and be accompanied by the separation of an\r\nexit fragment such as is illustrated in fig. 52, p. 169. The\r\nparticularly favourable character of the direct transverse and\r\nantero-posterior wounds depended on the slight amount of splintering of\r\nthe bones, the limited nature of the opening into the joint, and the\r\nshortness of the tracks in the soft parts, which ensured that, even if\r\ninfection did occur, the resulting pus was near the surface, and\r\ngenerally spread in that direction and escaped.\r\n\r\nWounds of the fifth class were the most dangerous, but the danger was\r\nentirely a secondary one, dependent on the occurrence of infection.\r\nThese injuries were liable to be accompanied by the presence of\r\nextensive irregular wounds of the soft parts, in which suppuration was\r\nfrequent, and the suppuration of the joint frequently meant subsequent\r\namputation, if not a worse result.\r\n\r\n_Course and symptoms of wounds of the joints._--The immediate result of\r\nany perforation of a joint was the development of intra-articular\r\neffusion. This consisted of synovial fluid admixed with a varying\r\nproportion of blood. The degree of synovitis was apt to vary with the\r\namount of force expended in the production of the injury; for this\r\nreason both high velocity and irregular impact were of importance in\r\nthis relation.\r\n\r\nThe constant feature, however, depended on the effusion of blood; this\r\nwas not rapid, or, as a rule, very abundant, but tended to increase\r\nduring the first twenty-four hours. It resulted in a swelling of the\r\njoint, which possessed some peculiar features. At first elastic and\r\nresilient, it slowly decreased in volume with the assumption of a soft\r\ndoughy character on palpation. In the case of the knee, where readily\r\npalpated, it very much resembled a tubercular synovial membrane, except\r\nfor its extreme regularity of surface; still more closely the condition\r\nnoted in a haemophilic knee of some duration. Absorption took place with\r\nsome rapidity, and except for slight thickening, the joints might appear\r\nalmost normal, in a period of from two to four weeks. With the\r\ndevelopment of the effusion there was local rise in temperature of the\r\nsurface, and in a considerable number of the cases a general rise of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThis latter was sometimes very marked, as in the case of all the other\r\ntraumatic blood effusions, but not quite so regular in occurrence. It\r\nwas important, as I have seen it give rise to the suspicion of\r\nsuppuration, when tapping resulted in nothing more than the evacuation\r\nof turbid synovia mixed with blood. Pain was rarely a prominent symptom\r\nin consequence of the generally moderate degree of distension.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, these injuries were characterised by the small tendency to\r\nthe development of adhesions; but this in great part depended on the\r\ncare expended on their treatment. If kept too long quiet, either from\r\nnecessity when the effusion was followed by much thickening, or when the\r\nexternal wound was large and so situated as to be harmfully influenced\r\nby movement, or in the ordinary course of treatment, troublesome\r\nstiffness, even amounting to firm anchylosis, sometimes followed. I saw\r\nseveral such cases, some of the most confirmed being wounds of the\r\nknee-joint complicated by injury to the popliteal vessels or nerves. The\r\nlatter complication I saw altogether six times, but only once with a\r\nthoroughly bad knee, and in this case the injury had affected both the\r\nvessels and the internal popliteal nerve. The joint in that case was\r\nstraightened out by continuous extension by Major Lougheed, when it came\r\nunder his charge some six weeks after the primary injury, but I hear has\r\nagain relapsed, and the popliteal paralysis is not much improved.\r\n\r\nThe small tendency to formation of adhesions in uncomplicated cases\r\nprobably depended on the coagulation of a layer of blood over the whole\r\ninternal lining of the joint. This kept the synovial surfaces apart at\r\nthe lines of reflection of the membrane, and, given sufficiently active\r\ntreatment, mobility was restored before any firm union could take place.\r\n\r\nThe primary escape of synovial fluid was rarely observed, as the wounds\r\nof the soft parts were too small and valvular to permit of it. Synovia\r\nin some abundance, mixed with pus, sometimes escaped in considerable\r\nquantity when infection had opened up the tracks.\r\n\r\nPrimary suppuration in any joint as a result of small and direct wounds\r\nwas very rare. I observed it only on one occasion. On the other hand, a\r\nconsiderable number of cases in which secondary suppuration occurred\r\ncame under my notice. In some of these the suppuration was secondary to\r\ncomminuted fractures of the shaft of the tibia, in which the articular\r\nextremity was implicated. These offered no special peculiarity. In\r\nothers infection of the joint was secondary to infection and suppuration\r\nin the deep part of long oblique wound tracks, and these were of\r\nsufficient interest to warrant the insertion of two illustrative cases.\r\n\r\n     (43) In a man wounded at Paardeberg the bullet entered the leg\r\n     to the inner side of the crest of the tibia, about 3 inches\r\n     below the tubercle; thence it coursed upwards to emerge about 2\r\n     inches above the cleft of the knee-joint on the outer side.\r\n     Regulation dressings were applied, and a week later the man\r\n     arrived at the Base, with little apparent mischief in the\r\n     knee-joint. He was placed in bed and warned against movement;\r\n     on the second day, however, he got up and walked to the\r\n     latrine. When bending his knee to sit down he was seized with\r\n     agonising pain in the joint, and had to call out for help; he\r\n     was then carried back to bed in a more or less collapsed\r\n     condition. The knee commenced to swell; there was rise of\r\n     temperature and great pain, together with extreme restlessness.\r\n     I was asked to see him two days later, and after a\r\n     consultation, Major Burton, R.A.M.C., freely incised the\r\n     knee-joint bi-laterally. One opening was closed, the second\r\n     plugged for drainage, as there was a large quantity of pus. No\r\n     improvement followed, and a week later Major Burton amputated\r\n     through the thigh. An attack of secondary haemorrhage a few days\r\n     later, combined with the degree of septic infection, ended the\r\n     man's life. On examination of the joint, a groove forming\r\n     three-fourths of a tunnel was found in the external tuberosity\r\n     of the tibia, leading into the knee-joint beneath the external\r\n     semilunar cartilage. The bullet had then passed upwards over\r\n     the outer border of the cartilage, bruised the margin of the\r\n     external condyle of the femur in such a manner as to depress\r\n     the outer compact layer, and finally escaped from the joint\r\n     near the upper reflection of the synovial membrane. The\r\n     synovial membrane was granular in appearance and reddened, but\r\n     there was no suppuration outside the confines of the joint,\r\n     except in a cavity corresponding to 2 inches of the track\r\n     before it actually perforated the tibia. A localised abscess\r\n     had evidently formed here and been diffused into the joint by\r\n     the movement of flexion already described.\r\n\r\n     (44) A man wounded during General Hamilton's advance on\r\n     Heilbron was struck on the outer aspect of the heel. An oval\r\n     opening of some size led down to a track in the os calcis; the\r\n     bullet was retained. The foot was dressed, and put up later in\r\n     a plaster-of-Paris splint. On the tenth day the splint was\r\n     removed to see to the wound, which looked satisfactory and was\r\n     re-dressed.\r\n\r\n     A few hours later the man was seized with very severe pain in\r\n     the ankle, and a day later I was asked to see him by Mr.\r\n     Alexander. The man was anaesthetised, and I examined the wound\r\n     with care, and also removed the retained bullet from the inner\r\n     margin of the leg. The bullet was reversed, having no doubt\r\n     suffered ricochet, hence the large aperture of entry, but it\r\n     was in no way deformed. I could not certainly determine the\r\n     presence of any fluid in the ankle-joint, and as the pain was\r\n     apparently localised to the distribution of the\r\n     musculo-cutaneous nerve, I decided not to freely open the\r\n     joint. In this, however, I erred, and two days later, after\r\n     consultation, the joint was freely incised by Mr. Alexander. It\r\n     was then found that the bullet in its passage had just touched\r\n     the posterior aspect of the tibia and wounded the ankle-joint.\r\n     A localised collection of pus which had formed in the deep part\r\n     of the wound had been diffused into the joint by the movements\r\n     made when the splint was removed, in a similar manner to that\r\n     described in the last case. This joint also did badly, and an\r\n     amputation of the leg had to be performed by Mr. Alexander to\r\n     save the man's life.\r\n\r\nThese two cases are particularly instructive as showing, first, how\r\nquietly a small amount of deep suppuration may sometimes take place;\r\nand, secondly, the importance of keeping the joints quiet on a splint\r\nwhen there is any reason to suspect their implication by wounds of this\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n_The general treatment_ of the wounded joints was simple. The old\r\ndifficulties of deciding on partial as against full excision, or\r\namputation, were never met with by us. We had merely to do our first\r\ndressings with care, fix the joint for a short period, and be careful to\r\ncommence passive movement as soon as the wounds were properly healed, to\r\nobtain in the great majority of cases perfect results. Careful light\r\nmassage, if available, was used to promote absorption of blood.\r\n\r\nIf suppuration occurred, the choice between incision and amputation had\r\nto be considered. In the early stages this choice depended entirely on\r\nthe nature of the injury to the bones. If this were slight, incision was\r\nthe best plan to adopt. I saw several cases so treated which did well,\r\nalthough convalescence was often prolonged, and only a small amount of\r\nmovement was regained. Amputation was sometimes indicated in cases of\r\nsevere bone-splintering, when the shafts were implicated, but was as a\r\nrule only performed after an ineffectual trial to cut short general\r\ninfection of the septicaemic type by incision.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at such length on the subject of suppuration on account of\r\nits importance, but I should add that, on the whole, suppuration of the\r\njoints was uncommon, except in the case of injuries far exceeding the\r\naverage in primary severity.\r\n\r\n_Special joints._--Such deviations from the general type of injury as\r\nabove described depended entirely on peculiarities of anatomical\r\narrangement, and peculiarities in the situation of the joint clefts in\r\nthe different parts of the body. A few words as to these are perhaps\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n_Shoulder-joint._--Wounds of this articulation were by no means common.\r\nThis depended, I think, on two points in the architecture of the joint:\r\nfirst, a bullet to enter the front of the cavity and traverse the joint\r\nneeded to come with great exactitude from the immediate front; secondly,\r\nwounds received from a purely lateral direction calculated to pierce the\r\nhead of the humerus and the glenoid cavity were naturally of very rare\r\noccurrence. Wounds of the prominent tip of the shoulder received while\r\nthe men were in the prone position were not uncommon, but it was\r\nremarkable how rarely the shoulder-joint was implicated in these. The\r\nquestion of the narrow nature of the cleft exposed also comes up in this\r\nposition. As far as my experience went, injuries to the lower portion of\r\nthe capsule accompanying wounds of the axilla were those most often met\r\nwith. The ease and neatness with which pure perforations of the head of\r\nthe humerus can be produced was also an important element in the\r\nfrequent escape of this joint. No case of fracture of the glenoid cavity\r\nhappened to come under my notice.\r\n\r\nI saw few instances in which the joint needed incision, and cannot\r\nrecall or find in my notes any case in which serious trouble arose.\r\n\r\n_Elbow-joint._--Injuries to this joint came second in frequency in my\r\nexperience to those of the knee. They were, in fact, comparatively\r\ncommon, especially in conjunction with fractures of the various bony\r\nprominences surrounding the articulation. Fractures of the lower end of\r\nthe humerus were of worse prognostic significance than those of the\r\nulna, on account of the greater tendency to splintering of the bone. I\r\nsaw several cases of pure perforation of the olecranon without any signs\r\nof implication of the elbow-joint. In a case which has been utilised for\r\nthe illustration of some of the types of aperture (fig. 20, p. 59), at\r\nthe end of a week there was no sign of any joint lesion, although the\r\nbullet had obviously perforated the articulation.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases of suppuration which came under my notice did well. I saw\r\none of them a few days ago, six months after the injury, with perfect\r\nmovement. In another of which I took notes, the bullet entered over the\r\nouter aspect of the head of the radius, to emerge just above the\r\ninternal condyle anteriorly. A considerable amount of comminution of the\r\nolecranon resulted, and when the man came into hospital some ten days\r\nlater the joint was suppurating. The joint was opened up from behind,\r\nand some fragments of bone removed by Mr. Hanwell. On the 26th day this\r\njoint was doing well, and considerable flexion and extension were\r\npossible without pain. There was a somewhat abundant discharge of bloody\r\nsynovia during the first few days after the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Illustrates the very neat and limited injury to\r\nthe Phalanges over the dorsal aspect of the first inter-phalangeal joint\r\nof the Middle Finger, accompanying a gutter wound received by the\r\npatient while holding a rifle.]\r\n\r\nI never saw any troublesome results from perforations of the _carpus_.\r\nThe joints of the _fingers_ also offered little special interest,\r\nexcept in so far as they afforded astonishing examples of the extreme\r\nneatness of the injuries which a small-calibre bullet can produce. Fig.\r\n59 is a good example of such an injury.\r\n\r\n_Hip-joint._--I can only repeat with regard to this joint what I have\r\nalready said as to the injuries to the head of the femur. I had\r\npractically no experience of small-calibre bullet injuries to the\r\nfemoral constituent, and beyond the single case of injury to the\r\nacetabular margin mentioned on p. 193 I saw no obvious wounds of the\r\njoint at all.\r\n\r\n_The knee_, as usual, proved itself _par excellence_ the joint most\r\ncommonly injured, no doubt as a result of its size, the extent of its\r\ncapsule anteriorly, and its exposed position. In spite, however, of the\r\nfrequency with which it suffered injury, and the opportunities it\r\nafforded for observation of the progress of the effusions towards\r\nabsorption, the injuries to the joint gave less anxiety and attained a\r\nmore favourable prognostic character than is the case in civil practice.\r\nThis depended on the very favourable course observed in the frequent\r\npure perforations following a direct line. These occurred in every\r\ndirection, the accompanying haemarthrosis usually disappearing completely\r\nin an average period of little over a month. The extremes can be fairly\r\nplaced at a fortnight and six weeks. Limitation of movement was slight\r\nor non-existent in many cases; in others it was of a very moderate\r\ncharacter, and I only remember to have seen one case in which a really\r\nserious anchylosis developed. In this the man was struck from a distance\r\nof 300 yards, and a considerable amount of bone dust from the femur was\r\nfound in the lips of the exit aperture. The wounds healed _per primam_,\r\nbut when I saw the man two months later anchylosis in the straight\r\nposition was apparently complete.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively frequent association of popliteal aneurisms with\r\nwounds of the knee-joint has already been spoken of in relation to\r\nanchylosis. Wounds of the popliteal space from larger bullets sometimes\r\ncaused more troublesome after-stiffness than wounds of the articulation\r\nitself. Again I remember a small pom-pom wound at the inner margin of\r\nthe ligamentum patellae without obvious wound of the joint, which was\r\naccompanied by synovitis from contusion, and was followed by very\r\nconsiderable limitation of movement. This had only been partially\r\nimproved when the patient returned home, in spite of prolonged massage\r\nand passive movement.\r\n\r\nThe general remarks on the joints cover all that need be said as to\r\nsuppuration of the knee-joint.\r\n\r\n_The ankle-joint_ maintained the undesirable character which it has\r\nalways held as a subject for gunshot injuries. This is entirely a\r\nquestion of sepsis, and in great measure depends on the fact that the\r\nfoot, as enclosed in a boot, is invested with skin particularly\r\ndifficult to thoroughly cleanse; while the socks are an additional\r\nsource of infection to the wounds before the patients come under proper\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nOf seven cases of suppurating ankle-joint, of which I have notes, only\r\ntwo retained the foot, and one of these after a very dangerous illness.\r\nThis case was one of special interest as exemplifying the results\r\ndependent on variations in velocity on the part of the bullet. The\r\npatient was struck at a distance of twenty yards. The bullet entered the\r\nfront of the right ankle-joint and emerged through the internal\r\nmalleolus, just behind its centre, causing no comminution of the latter.\r\nIt then entered the left foot by a type wound one inch behind and below\r\nthe tip of the internal malleolus, traversed and comminuted the\r\nastragalus, and emerged one inch below the tip of the external\r\nmalleolus. The first joint healed _per primam_. The second produced by\r\nthe bullet when passing at a lower rate of velocity was accompanied by\r\nconsiderable comminution of the bone. It suppurated, and gave rise to\r\ngreat anxiety both for the fate of the foot and the life of the patient.\r\nIt is probable that the more abundant haemorrhage which took place from\r\nthe second wound was in part responsible for the occurrence of\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nThe second of the two cases is of some interest in relation to the\r\ndoctrine of chances as to the position in which a wound may be received.\r\nThe man was wounded in one of the earlier engagements, a bullet passing\r\ntransversely through his leg immediately behind the bones and about half\r\nan inch above the level of the ankle-joint. He recovered, and rejoined\r\nhis regiment, only to receive at Paardeberg a second wound, about an\r\ninch lower, which traversed the ankle-joint. On his return to Wynberg he\r\nhappened to be sent to the same pavilion, and occupied the same bed he\r\nhad left on returning to the front.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the result of wounds of the joints of the _foot_ has\r\nreceived sufficient consideration under the heading of wounds of the\r\ntarsus.\r\n\r\nThe repetition of the fact that, among the whole series of cases on\r\nwhich this chapter is founded, not a single instance of primary or\r\nsecondary excision of a joint, either partial or complete, is recorded,\r\nforms an apt conclusion to my remarks on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE HEAD AND NECK\r\n\r\n\r\nInjuries to the head formed one of the most fruitful sources of death,\r\nboth upon the battlefield and in the Field hospitals. It has been\r\nsuggested that the mere fact of wounds of the head being readily visible\r\nensured all such being at once distinguished and correctly reported,\r\nwhile wounds hidden by the clothing often escaped detection. When the\r\nexternal insignificance of many of the fatal wounds of the trunk is\r\ntaken into consideration this is possible; but, on the other hand, it\r\nmust be borne in mind that the head is in any attitude the most\r\nadvanced, and often the most exposed, part of the body, and even when\r\nthe soldier had taken 'cover,' it was frequently raised for purposes of\r\nobservation. For the latter reasons I believe injury to the head fully\r\ndeserved the comparative importance as a fatal accident with which it\r\nwas credited.\r\n\r\nA number of somewhat sensational immediate recoveries from serious\r\nwounds of the head have been placed upon record. Observation, however,\r\nshows that these, with but few exceptions, belonged either to certain\r\ngroups of cases the relatively favourable prognosis in which is familiar\r\nto us in civil practice, or that the wounds were received from a very\r\nlong range of fire, and hence the injuries were strictly localised in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\nANATOMICAL LESIONS\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the scalp._--Nothing very special is to be recorded with\r\nregard to these; they either formed the terminals of perforating wounds,\r\nor were the result of superficial glancing shots. The glancing wounds\r\nwere of the nature of furrows, varying in depth from mere grazes to\r\nwounds laying bare the bone. Their peculiarity was centred in the fact\r\nthat a definite loss of substance accompanied them, the skin being\r\nactually carried away by the bullet; hence gaping was the rule. Every\r\ngradation in depth was met with, but the only situations in which wounds\r\nof considerable length could occur were the frontal region in tranverse\r\nshots, or, when the bullet passed sagitally, the sides of the head, or\r\nthe flat area of the vertex.\r\n\r\nThe danger of overlooking injuries to the bone was of special importance\r\nin the short subcutaneous tracks occasionally met with at the points at\r\nwhich the surface of the skull makes sharp bends. In all such wounds it\r\nwas a safe rule to assume a fracture of the skull until this was\r\nexcluded by direct examination. In some of the gutter wounds and\r\nsubcutaneous tracks crossing the forehead and sides of the head, signs\r\nof intracranial disturbance were occasionally observed in the absence of\r\nexternal fracture, such as transient muscular weakness, unsteadiness in\r\nmovements, giddiness, diplopia, or loss of memory and intellectual\r\nclearness. In connection with such symptoms the classical injury of\r\nsplintering of the internal table of the skull, the external remaining\r\nintact, had to be borne in mind, but I observed no proven instance of\r\nthis accident. I am of opinion, moreover, that its occurrence with small\r\nbullets travelling at a high degree of velocity must be very rare, since\r\nlittle deflection is probable unless the contact has been sufficiently\r\ndecided to fracture the external table; while in the cases of spent\r\nbullets the injury is unlikely, as requiring a considerable degree of\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n_Injuries to the cranial bones, without evidence of gross lesion to the\r\nbrain._--It may be premised that these were of the rarest occurrence,\r\nand they may be most readily described by shortly recounting the\r\nconditions observed in a few cases I noted at the time. The injuries\r\nresulted from blows with spent bullets, from bullets barely striking the\r\nskull directly, or those striking over the region of the frontal\r\nsinuses. Wounds of the mastoid process will not be considered in this\r\nconnection as being of a special nature (see p. 299).\r\n\r\nI saw only one case of escape of the internal, with depressed fracture\r\nof the external, table of the skull.\r\n\r\n     (45) In marching on Heilbron a man in the advance guard was\r\n     struck by a bullet at right angles just within the margin of\r\n     the hairy scalp. The regiment was at the time to all intents\r\n     and purposes outside the range of rifle fire, and the patient\r\n     was the only individual struck among its number. When brought\r\n     into the Highland Brigade Field Hospital, a single typical\r\n     entry wound was discovered; examination with the probe gave\r\n     evidence of a slight depression in the external table of the\r\n     frontal bone just above the temporal ridge. Although no\r\n     perforation was detectible by the probe, and this was\r\n     positively excluded on the raising of a flap (Major Murray,\r\n     R.A.M.C.), it was considered advisable to remove a 1/4-inch\r\n     trephine crown, the pin of the instrument being applied to the\r\n     margin of the depression. No depression or splintering of the\r\n     internal table was discovered, nor any injury to the dura, nor\r\n     blood upon the surface of that membrane. The man made an\r\n     uninterrupted recovery.\r\n\r\n     (46) A case of frontal injury was shown to me at Wynberg, in\r\n     which a distinct furrow could be traced across the upper part\r\n     of the frontal sinuses. There had been no symptoms beyond\r\n     temporary diplopia, and the wound was healed; no surgical\r\n     interference had been deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n     (47) In a man wounded at Poplar Grove, a single typical wound\r\n     of entry was found 3/4 of an inch above the right eyebrow and\r\n     the same distance from the median line. No primary symptoms\r\n     were observed, but on the evening of the second day the\r\n     temperature rose above 100 deg. F., and the man seemed somewhat\r\n     heavy and dull. The patient was examined by Major Fiaschi and\r\n     Mr. Watson Cheyne, and it was decided to explore the wound. Mr.\r\n     Cheyne removed fragments both of external and internal tables,\r\n     one of the latter having made a punctiform opening, not\r\n     admitting the finest probe, in the dura-mater. The bullet was\r\n     traced into the nasal fossae, where it was subsequently\r\n     localised with the aid of the Roentgen rays when the patient\r\n     came under my observation at Wynberg some days later (fig. 60).\r\n\r\n_Gunshot fracture of the skull with concurrent brain injury._--This was\r\nthe commonest form of head injury, and possessed two main peculiarities;\r\nfirstly, the large amount of brain destruction compared with the extent\r\nof the bone lesion; secondly, the fact that any region of the skull was\r\nequally open to damage. In consequence of the second peculiarity, the\r\nposition and direction of secondary fissures are not so dependent on\r\nanatomical structure as in the corresponding injuries of civil practice.\r\nThus, fractures of the base, for instance, were less constant in their\r\ncourse and position. The cases as a whole are best divided into four\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Mauser Bullet in Nasal Fossa. (Skiagram by H.\r\nCatling.) Case No. 47]\r\n\r\n1. Extensive sagittal tracks passing _deeply_ through the brain, and\r\nvertical wounds passing from base to vertex or _vice versa_, in the\r\nposterior two thirds of the skull. These will be referred to as general\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\n2. Vertical or coronal wounds in the frontal region.\r\n\r\n3. Glancing or obliquely perforating wounds of varying depth in any part\r\nof the head.\r\n\r\n4. Fractures of the base.\r\n\r\nOf these classes the first was nearly uniformly fatal; the second\r\nrelatively favourable, and with low degrees of velocity often\r\naccompanied by surprisingly slight immediate effects; while the third\r\nhad perhaps the best prognosis of all, but this varied as to the defects\r\nthat might be left, and with the region of the head affected.\r\n\r\n1. _General injuries._--Fractures of this class may be treated of almost\r\napart. For their production the retention of a considerable degree of\r\nvelocity on the part of the bullet was always necessary, and the results\r\nwere consequently both extensive and severe.\r\n\r\nThe aperture of entry was comparatively small, since to take so direct\r\nand lengthy a course through the skull the impact of the bullet needed\r\nto be at nearly an exact right angle to the surface of the bone. Any\r\ndisposition to assume the oval form, therefore, depended mainly upon the\r\ndegree of slope of the actual area of the skull implicated. In size the\r\naperture of entry did not greatly exceed the calibre of the bullet; in\r\noutline it was seldom exactly circular, but rather roughly four-sided,\r\nwith rounded angles, slightly oval, or pear-shaped. The margin of the\r\nopening consisted of outer table alone, the inner being always\r\nconsiderably comminuted. Fragments of the latter, together with the\r\nmajority of those corresponding to the loss of substance of the outer\r\ntable, were driven through the dura mater and embedded in the brain.\r\nThese bony fragments were more or less widely distributed over an area\r\nof a square inch or more, and not confined to a narrow track.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Diagram of Aperture of Entry in Occipital Bone,\r\nshowing radiating fissures exact length. The exit in the frontal region\r\nwas of typical explosive character. Range '100 yards'.]\r\n\r\nThe amount of fissuring at the aperture of entry was often not so\r\nextensive as I had been led to expect. Fig. 61 is a diagram illustrating\r\na fairly typical instance; in some cases no fissuring existed. As a rule\r\nthe nearer to the base, the greater was the amount of fissuring\r\nobserved. The fissures were sometimes very extensive in this position,\r\nprobably as a result of the lesser degree of elasticity in this region\r\nof the skull. Again, when the aperture of entry was near the parts of\r\nthe vertex where sudden bends take place, considerable fissuring of the\r\nsame nature as that seen in the superficial tracks (fig. 68) was\r\nproduced in the flat portion of the skull above the point of entrance.\r\n\r\nRadial fissuring around the aperture of entry in the skull scarcely\r\ncorresponds in degree with that seen when the shafts of the long bones\r\nare struck, and is far less marked and regular than when one of these\r\nsmall bullets strikes a thick sheet of glass set in a frame. I saw\r\nseveral apertures in the thick glass of the windows of the waterworks\r\nbuilding at Bloemfontein produced by Mauser bullets. They differed\r\nlittle from the opening seen in an ordinary plate-glass window resulting\r\nfrom a blow from a stone, except perhaps in the regularity and\r\nmultiplicity of the radial fissures. As in the skull, the opening was a\r\nlittle larger than the calibre of the bullet, and the loss of substance\r\non the inner aspect considerably exceeded that on the outer.\r\n\r\nThe degree of fissuring is probably affected by the resistance offered\r\nby the particular skull, or the special region struck, but as a rule the\r\nelasticity and capacity for alteration in shape possessed by the bony\r\ncapsule, is opposed to the production of the extreme radial starring\r\nobserved in the long bones or a fixed sheet of glass. Corroborative\r\nevidence of the influence of elasticity in the prevention of starring is\r\nseen in the limited nature of the comminution of the ribs in cases of\r\nperforating wounds of the thorax.\r\n\r\nIn the most severe cases we can only speak of the 'aperture' of exit in\r\na limited sense in so far as the opening in the scalp is concerned; this\r\nwas often comparatively small, not exceeding 3/4 of an inch in diameter.\r\nBeneath this limited opening in the soft parts, the bone of the skull\r\nwas smashed in a most extensive manner. The portion exactly\r\ncorresponding to the point of exit of the bullet was carried altogether\r\naway, but around this point a number of large irregularly shaped\r\nfragments of bone, from 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter, were found loose, and\r\noften so displaced as to expose a considerable area of the dura-mater.\r\nBeyond the area of these loose fragments, fissures extended into the\r\nbase and vertex, in the latter case often being limited in their extent\r\nby the nearest suture.\r\n\r\nOver extensive fractures of this nature general oedema and\r\ninfiltration of the scalp, due to extravasation of blood, were present.\r\nWhen the exit was situated in the frontal region ecchymosis often\r\nextended to the eyelids and down the face, while in the occipital region\r\nsimilar ecchymosis was often seen at the back of the neck.\r\n\r\nThe opening in the dura mater at the aperture of entry was either\r\nslitlike, or more often irregular from laceration by the fragments of\r\nbone driven in by the bullet. At the point of exit a similar limited\r\nopening corresponded with the spot at which the bullet had passed, while\r\nseparate rents of larger size were often seen at some little distance.\r\nThe latter were the result of laceration of the outer surface of the\r\nmembrane by the margins of the large loose fragments of bone above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nInjury to the brain more than corresponded in extent to the fractures of\r\nthe bone. Pulping of its tissue existed over a wide area both at the\r\npoints of entrance and of exit. In the former position the amount of\r\ndamage was the less, the gross changes roughly corresponding with the\r\ntissue directly implicated by the bullet itself, and the fragments of\r\nbone carried forward by it. The degree of splintering of the skull\r\ntherefore in great part determined the severity of the lesion. At the\r\nexit aperture much more widespread destruction existed, while masses of\r\nbrain tissue, small shreds of the membranes, fragments of bone, and\r\n_debris_ from the scalp were found occasionally bound together by\r\ncoagulated blood and protruding from an exit opening of some size. The\r\nlargest masses of such _debris_ were most often seen in instances in\r\nwhich the bullet had entered by the base to escape at the vertex of the\r\nskull.\r\n\r\nThe brain in the line of injury suffered comparatively slightly, but\r\nsmall parenchymatous haemorrhages into its tissue indicated in lesser\r\ndegree the same type of injury undergone by the mass of brain pulp and\r\nsmall blood-clots found at the external limits of the wound. Beyond this\r\nextensive haemorrhages at the base of the skull were common.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the extensive character of the brain destruction in the\r\nregion of the aperture of exit, it must be borne in mind that this\r\nlesion corresponds in position with one which would exist even if the\r\ninjury were of a non-penetrating degree. A large proportion of the\r\ncontusion and destruction is therefore explained by violent impact of\r\nthe projected brain with the skull prior to the passage of the bullet,\r\nand not to the direct action of the bullet on the tissues.\r\n\r\nThese cases of 'general injury' afford a marked example of the lesions\r\nto which the term 'explosive' has been applied, and as such have an\r\nimportant bearing on the theories held as to the mode of production of\r\nexplosive effect. The increased area of tissue damage at the aperture of\r\nexit favours the theory of direct transmission of a part of the force\r\nwith which the bullet is endowed, to the molecules of tissue bounding\r\nthe track made by the projectile. Thus the area of destruction\r\ncorresponds with the cone-like figure which one would expect to be built\r\nup by the vibrations spreading from the primary point of impact. The\r\nexit region of the skull is subjected not alone to the force of the\r\ntravelling bullet, but also to that exerted over a much wider area by\r\nthe tissue to which secondary vibrations have been communicated. The\r\nbrain itself is, in fact, dashed with such violence against the bone as\r\nto cause a great part of the injury.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the brain in its reaction to the bullet forms as near an\r\napproach to a fluid as any solid tissue in the human body, and\r\nexperimental observation has shown how greatly its presence or absence\r\nin the skull affects the degree of comminution on the exit side; hence\r\nthe fondness for the so-called hydraulic theory that has been always\r\nexhibited in the case of these injuries. The localisation of the injury\r\nin its highest degree to the neighbourhood of the exit aperture,\r\nhowever, shows that in any case the main wave takes a definite direction\r\nin a course corresponding to that of the bullet.\r\n\r\nThe real importance of the presence of the brain within the skull in\r\nincreasing the amount of damage at the exit end of the track, is as a\r\nmedium for the ready transmission of forcible vibrations. That the\r\nlatter are to some extent conveyed as by a fluid is evidenced by the\r\noccasional presence of brain matter and fragments of bone in the\r\naperture of entry, which suggests recoil or splash such as would be\r\nexpected from a fluid wave.\r\n\r\nExperience of the character of the lesions observed after severe\r\nconcussion by the ordinarily somewhat coarser forms of violence common\r\nto civil life, fully explains the severity of the damage to the brain\r\ntissue met with in injuries due to bullets of small calibre. Viewing the\r\nelaborate arrangements which exist for the preservation of the central\r\nnervous system from the moderate vibration incidental to ordinary\r\nexistence, it is easy to appreciate the harmfulness of such exquisite\r\nvibratory force as that transmitted by a bullet of small calibre\r\ntravelling at a high rate of velocity.\r\n\r\n_Effect of ricochet in the production of severe forms of injury._--In\r\nconnection with the lesions above described mention must be made of\r\ncases in which the aperture of entry reaches a large size, or a portion\r\nof the skull is actually blown away.\r\n\r\nExamples of the former class were not uncommon; I will briefly relate\r\none.\r\n\r\n     (48) A Highlander while lying in the prone position at\r\n     Rooipoort, was struck by a bullet probably at a distance of\r\n     about 1,000 yards. A large entry wound in the scalp was\r\n     produced, while the defect in the skull was coarsely comminuted\r\n     and was capable of admitting three fingers into a mass of\r\n     pulped brain. Both brain matter and fragments of bone were\r\n     found in the external wound, which was situated just anterior\r\n     to the right parietal eminence. The bullet passed onwards\r\n     through the base of the skull, crossing the external auditory\r\n     meatus, fracturing the zygoma and probably the condyle of the\r\n     mandible, and eventually lodged beneath the masseter muscle.\r\n     Blood and brain matter escaped from the external auditory\r\n     meatus.\r\n\r\n     The patient was brought off the field in a semi-conscious\r\n     condition, the pupils moderately contracted but equal, the\r\n     pulse 66, very small and irregular in beat, the respiration\r\n     quiet and easy, and with paralysis of the left side of the\r\n     body. The faeces had been passed involuntarily.\r\n\r\n     The wound was cleansed and bone fragments removed. The patient\r\n     had to travel in a wagon for the next three days until the\r\n     column halted. The progress of the case was unsatisfactory, as\r\n     the wound became infected, and the man eventually died on the\r\n     14th day of general septicaemia, but with little evidence of\r\n     local extension of septic inflammation.\r\n\r\n     In this instance the head was no doubt struck by a bullet which\r\n     had previously made ricochet contact with the ground. I saw\r\n     several such cases.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with such injuries are those in which large portions\r\nof the skull and scalp were actually blown away. I never witnessed one\r\nof these myself, but I recall two instances described to me by officers\r\nwho lay near the wounded men on the field. In one the frontal region was\r\ncarried away so extensively that, to repeat the familiar description\r\ngiven by the officer, 'he could see down into the man's stomach through\r\nhis head.' In a second case the greater part of the occipital region was\r\nblown away in a similar manner, and this was of especial interest as the\r\nwounded man was seen to sit up on the buttocks and turn rapidly round\r\nthree or four times before falling apparently dead. The observation\r\noffers interesting evidence of the result of an extensive gross lesion\r\nof the cerebellum.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of exact information, it may well be that such injuries\r\nas the two latter were produced by some special form of bullet, but as\r\nboth were produced while the patients were lying on the ground, and\r\ntherefore especially liable to blows from ricochet bullets, I am\r\ninclined to attribute both to this cause.\r\n\r\nIn considering injuries of the above nature, one cannot help speculating\r\non the possible influence of a head-over-heels ricochet turn on the part\r\nof the bullet while traversing the long sagittal axis of the skull. It\r\nis not uncommon for apical target ricochets to present evidence of\r\ndamage to the apex and base of the mantle alone. This must depend on a\r\nrapid turn on impact, which might well be imitated in the case of the\r\nskull, and would then go far to explain the production of some of the\r\nmost severe forms of explosive exit wounds met with. See cases 48, 54,\r\n68.\r\n\r\nShort of ricochet, the influence of simple wobbling must also be\r\nconsidered in shots from a long range. The entry wound may be large as a\r\nresult of this condition, but as the velocity possessed by the bullet is\r\nlow, the injuries would probably not be of a very severe nature.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the subject of wobbling, reference should be made to\r\nthe form suggested by Nimier and Laval, in which the wobble, as the\r\nresult of resistance to the apex of the revolving bullet, assumes the\r\nform of movement seen when the spin of a top is failing. This would\r\nexplain a peculiarity in some wounds of entry over the skull first\r\npointed out to me by Mr. J. J. Day. When such wounds were explored, as\r\nwell as the presence of brain in the entry aperture, a number of\r\nfragments of the external table of the skull were found everted and\r\nfixed in the tissues of the scalp. As already suggested, this may be\r\nmere evidence of splash, but it may be equally well explained by a\r\nprocess of wobble around the axis of revolution of the bullet. This\r\nmight, no doubt, also be invoked to explain the displacement of some of\r\nthe fragments in fractures of the long bones, where considerable\r\nresistance to the passage of the bullet is offered.\r\n\r\nII. _Vertical or coronal wounds in the frontal region._--These injuries\r\nwere common, and offered some of the most interesting illustrations of\r\nthe variations in symptoms and effects following apparently exactly\r\nidentical lesions, judging from the condition of the external soft parts\r\nalone; since the latter sometimes gave little indication of the force\r\n(dependent on the rate of velocity) which had been applied.\r\n\r\nWith the lower degrees of velocity simple punctured fractures of the\r\nskull resulted, without extensive lesion of the frontal lobes as\r\nevidenced by immediate symptoms. The nature of the fractures differed in\r\nno way from the punctured fractures we are familiar with in civil\r\npractice. The openings of entry in the bone were irregularly rounded,\r\ncorresponding in size to the particular calibre of the bullet concerned.\r\nThe margin consisted of outer table alone, while the inner table was\r\neither considerably comminuted, or a large piece was depressed, wounding\r\nthe dura-mater and projecting into the brain substance (see fig. 63).\r\nThe aperture of exit presented exactly the opposite characters, the\r\nsplintering comminution or separation of a large fragment affecting the\r\nouter table, while the inner presented a simple perforation. The latter\r\ncondition is represented in figs. 71 and 72, and I will here give short\r\nnotes of four illustrative cases, as being the shortest and most\r\nsatisfactory method of conveying a correct idea of the nature of such\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62--Aperture of Entry in Frontal Bone. Case No. 50.\r\n1/2]\r\n\r\n     (49) _Vertical perforation of frontal bone._--Wounded at\r\n     Belmont, while in the prone position. Aperture of _entry_\r\n     (Mauser), at the anterior margin of the hairy scalp on the left\r\n     side; course, through the anterior part of the left frontal\r\n     lobe, roof of the left orbit, cutting the optic nerve and\r\n     injuring the back of the eyeball, floor of the orbit, the\r\n     antrum, the hard palate, and tongue. _Exit_, in mid line of the\r\n     submaxillary region. No cerebral symptoms were noted, and on\r\n     the fifth day the man was sent to the Base hospital without\r\n     operation; the pulse was then 70 and the temperature normal.\r\n     The movements of the eyeball were perfect, but blindness was\r\n     absolute. At the Base hospital the eye suppurated and was\r\n     removed. The patient was then sent home apparently well. He has\r\n     since been discharged from the service, and is now employed as\r\n     a painter in Portsmouth Dockyard.\r\n\r\n     (50) _Vertical perforation of frontal bone._--Wounded at\r\n     Paardeberg while in the prone position. Range, 600-700 yards.\r\n     Aperture of _entry_ (Mauser), at the fore margin of the hairy\r\n     scalp above the centre of the right eyebrow; course, through\r\n     the anterior third of the right frontal lobe, roof of orbit,\r\n     front of eyeball, margin of floor of orbit making a distinct\r\n     palpable notch, and cheek; _exit_ through the red margin of the\r\n     upper lip, 1/2 an inch from the right angle of mouth. The\r\n     bullet slightly grooved the lower lip.\r\n\r\n     The patient rose almost immediately after being struck, and\r\n     walked about a mile, although feeling dizzy and tired. The\r\n     wounds, which both bled considerably, were then dressed. After\r\n     three days' stay in a Field hospital, the patient was sent in a\r\n     bullock wagon three days and nights' journey to Modder River\r\n     and thence to the Base.\r\n\r\n     There was anaesthesia over the area supplied by the outer branch\r\n     of the supra-orbital nerve, extending from the supra-orbital\r\n     notch backwards into the parietal region, but none over the\r\n     area supplied by the second division of the fifth nerve.\r\n\r\n     On the tenth day there were no signs of cerebral disturbance\r\n     except a pulse of 48. The eyeball was suppurating, and the\r\n     temperature rose to 99 deg. at night. The lids were still swollen\r\n     and closed.\r\n\r\n     A few days later the eyeball was removed and at the same time a\r\n     flap was raised and the fracture explored (Major Burton,\r\n     R.A.M.C.). An opening somewhat angular, 1/3 of an inch in\r\n     diameter, was found with a thin margin in the outer table of\r\n     the skull (fig. 62); when this was enlarged with a Hoffman's\r\n     forceps, an opening in the dura was discovered, and\r\n     cerebro-spinal fluid escaped. A piece of the inner table of the\r\n     skull (fig. 63), 3/4 by 1/3 an inch in size, was discovered\r\n     projecting downwards vertically into the brain. This latter was\r\n     removed and the wound closed. Healing by primary union\r\n     followed, and no further symptoms were observed.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: FIG. 63.--Fragment of Inner Table depending\r\n     vertically from lower margin of puncture shown in fig. 62. The\r\n     centre was perforated. Exact size]\r\n\r\n     (51) _Transverse frontal wound._--Wounded at Paardeberg. The\r\n     man was sitting down at the time he was struck, in the belief\r\n     that he was out of the range of fire. The _entry_ and _exit_\r\n     wounds were almost symmetrical, placed on the two sides of the\r\n     forehead at the margin of the hairy scalp, 2-1/4 inches above\r\n     the level of the external angular processes of the frontal\r\n     bone. The patient lost consciousness for about half an hour,\r\n     then rose and walked half a mile to the Field hospital. The\r\n     wounds were dressed, and after a stay of three days in\r\n     hospital, the man was sent the three days' journey to Modder\r\n     River; during the journey he got in and out of the wagon when\r\n     he wished. After two days' stay at Modder, a journey was again\r\n     made by rail to De Aar (122-1/2 miles). The wounds were healed.\r\n     The man stayed at De Aar nearly a month, and then, rejoining\r\n     his regiment, made a two days' march of some 22 miles on hot\r\n     days. He had to fall out twice on the way by reason of\r\n     headache, feeling dizzy, and 'things looking black.' He did not\r\n     own to any loss of memory or intellectual trouble, but was\r\n     invalided to England. This patient returned to South Africa\r\n     later, and is now on active service.\r\n\r\n     (52) _Transverse frontal wound._--Within a few days an almost\r\n     identical symmetrical wound in the frontal region occurred in\r\n     the same district, from a near range. The patient became\r\n     immediately unconscious, and remained so until his death some\r\n     four days later, his symptoms being in no way alleviated by\r\n     operation and the removal of a quantity of bone fragments and\r\n     cerebral _debris_. At the _post-mortem_ examination, extensive\r\n     destruction of both hemispheres of the brain was revealed, and\r\n     large fissures extended into the base of the skull.\r\n\r\nIII. _Glancing or oblique perforating wounds of varying depth in any\r\nportion of the cranium._--These injuries were the most common, the most\r\nhighly characteristic of small-calibre bullet wounds, the most\r\ninteresting from the point of view of diagnosis, prognosis, and\r\ntreatment, and beyond this they formed the variety most unlike any that\r\nwe meet with in civil practice.\r\n\r\nThey were met with in every region of the cranium, and in every degree\r\nof depth and severity. The lesser are best designated as gutter\r\nfractures, the deeper are perforating and gradually approximate\r\nthemselves to the type of injury described as class 1.\r\n\r\nWhen the bullet struck a prominent or angular spot on the skull a\r\nconsiderable oval-shaped fragment was occasionally carried away, leaving\r\nan exposed surface of the diploe (case 60, p. 274). Under these\r\ncircumstances the apparent lesion on raising a flap was slight, but\r\nexploration often showed extensive intra-cranial mischief. Thus in the\r\ncase referred to both dura and brain were wounded, and continuing\r\nhaemorrhage led to the development of progressive paralysis, relieved\r\nonly by operation.\r\n\r\nFrom the more deeply passing bullets a more or less oval opening\r\nresulted, in which both tables were freely comminuted and displaced.\r\nThese cases differed from the typical gutter fracture only in length and\r\noutline, and the nature of the accompanying intra-cranial lesion was\r\nidentical, while in the latter particular they differed much from\r\nfractures in which the impact of the bullet was direct, in spite of a\r\nnear resemblance in the appearances in the osseous defect.\r\n\r\nI saw one instance in which a circular fissure about 1-1/2 inch from\r\nthe actual opening of entry surrounded the latter, the area of bone\r\nwithin the circle being somewhat depressed, though radial fissures were\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nIn several of these cases fragments of lead were either found on the\r\nfractured surface of the bone or within the cranial cavity, showing that\r\nthe bullets had undergone fissuring of the mantle, or had actually\r\nbroken up on impact.\r\n\r\n_Gutter fractures._--The nature of the injury to the bones in these is\r\nbest illustrated by a series of diagrams of sections such as are shown\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Gutter Fracture of first degree. The drawing\r\ndoes not show well the small fragments of bone usually carried from the\r\nmargins of the depression by the bullet.]\r\n\r\nIn the most superficial injuries the outer table was grooved and\r\ndepressed, usually with loss of substance from small fragments directly\r\nshot away: these latter had either been driven through the wound in the\r\nsoft parts, or remained embedded on the deep aspect of the enveloping\r\nscalp (fig. 64). In the less common variety the scalp was slit to a\r\nlength corresponding with the injury to the bone, but more often oval\r\nopenings in the skin existed at either end of the track. The inner table\r\nwas practically never intact, but the amount of comminution naturally\r\nvaried with the depth to which the outer table was implicated (fig. 65\r\n_A_, and _B_).\r\n\r\nThe following is an illustrative example of this degree, and also\r\nemphasises the consequences which may follow primary non-interference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Diagrammatic transverse sections of varying\r\ncondition of bones in Gutter Fractures of the first degree. _A._ With no\r\nloss of substance. _B._ With comminution.]\r\n\r\n     (53) _Superficial gutter fracture in parietal region.\r\n     Convulsive twitchings. Secondary paralysis._--Wounded at Modder\r\n     River. Range, 400 yards. A scalp wound 3 inches in length ran\r\n     vertically downwards, commencing 1 inch from the median line,\r\n     and situated immediately over the upper third of the right\r\n     fissure of Rolando. The patient was unconscious for several\r\n     hours after the injury, and later suffered with severe\r\n     headache, and twitchings in the left shoulder and arm.\r\n\r\n     The wound healed, but a well-marked groove was palpable in the\r\n     bone beneath, and the twitchings persisted. The latter came on\r\n     about every twenty minutes, and loss of power in the left upper\r\n     extremity, and to a less degree in the lower, developed. The\r\n     memory was defective, and the patient suffered at times with\r\n     headache. The pupils were equal but sluggish in action. No\r\n     changes were discovered in the fundus beyond a well-developed\r\n     myopic crescent at the lower and outer part of the left disc\r\n     (Mr. Hanwell).\r\n\r\n     The twitchings became more frequent and latterly were\r\n     accompanied by somewhat severe muscular contractions in the\r\n     upper extremity, while the loss of power in the lower extremity\r\n     became more marked. Headache was also more troublesome.\r\n\r\n     The patient throughout refused any operation, saying he would\r\n     rather go home first, and at the end of a month he left for\r\n     England.\r\n\r\nIn the deeper injuries more and more of the outer table was cut away,\r\nand the inner became gradually more depressed, fractured, or comminuted\r\n(fig 66).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--Gutter Fracture of the second degree.\r\nPerforating the skull in the centre of its course. External table alone\r\ncarried away at either end.]\r\n\r\nBevelling at the expense of the outer table at both entry and exit ends\r\nof the course existed, but in either case a portion of the inner table\r\nwas also detached and depressed. Sometimes the depressed portion of the\r\ninner table was mainly composed of one elongated fragment; this was\r\neither when the bullet had not implicated a great thickness of the outer\r\ntable, or had passed with great obliquity through especially dense bone\r\n(see fig. 70). When the bullet had passed more deeply the inner table\r\nwas comminuted into numberless fragments. I have frequently seen 50 or\r\n60 removed. Where such tracks crossed convex surfaces of the skull, the\r\ntwo conditions were often combined; thus at one portion of the track,\r\nusually the centre, the comminution was extreme, while at either end a\r\nconsiderable elongated fragment of inner table was often found, the\r\nlatter perhaps more commonly at the distal or exit extremity (fig. 67).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Diagrammatic transverse sections of complete\r\nGutter Fracture. _A._ External table destroyed, large fragment of\r\ninternal table depressed. (Low velocity or dense bone.) _B._ Comminution\r\nand pulverisation of both tables centre of track. _C._ Depression of\r\ninner table (low velocity)]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the injury to the bone when the flight of the bullet\r\nactually involved the whole thickness of the calvarium was comparable to\r\nthat seen in the case of the long bones when struck by a bullet\r\ntravelling at a moderate rate (see plate XIX. of the tibia, or what is\r\nillustrated in the case of the pelvis in fig. 55). In point of fact, a\r\nclean longitudinal track appeared to have been cut out. The length of\r\nthese tracks naturally depended upon the region of the skull struck.\r\nWhen a point corresponding to a sharp convexity, or a sudden bend in\r\nthe surface, was implicated, an oval opening of varying length in its\r\nlong axis was the result; when a flat area, as exists in the frontal or\r\nlateral portions of the skull, was the seat of injury, a long track was\r\ncut.\r\n\r\n_Superficial perforating fractures._--These formed the next degree; the\r\nchief peculiarity in them was the lifting of nearly the whole thickness\r\nof the skull at the distal margin of the entry, and the proximal edge of\r\nthe exit, openings; the flatter the area of skull under which the bullet\r\ntravelled the more extensive was the comminution. In some cases nearly\r\nthe whole length of the bone superficial to the track would be raised;\r\nin fact, the bullet having once entered, the force is applied from\r\nwithin in exactly the same way that it operates on the inner table in\r\nthe gutter fractures. A corresponding injury is met with in the case of\r\nthe bones of the extremities (see fig. 57 of the tibia), and again the\r\nresemblance between these injuries of the skull and such perforations of\r\nthe long bones as are illustrated by skiagrams Nos. III. and XXIII. of\r\nthe clavicle and fibula is a close one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Superficial Perforating Fracture. Illustrating\r\nlifting of roof at both entry and exit openings]\r\n\r\nI will add here a case of coexistent gutter fracture and perforating\r\nwound of the skull, the conditions of the bone in which will illustrate\r\nthe behaviour of the outer and inner tables respectively, when struck\r\nwith moderate force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Diagrammatic longitudinal section of Fracture\r\nshown in fig. 68]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Fragment forming the main part of the floor of\r\nGutter Fracture in the squamous portion of the temporal bone. (Low\r\nvelocity, hard bone)]\r\n\r\n     (54) Wounded at Thaba-nchu. Guedes bullet. _Entry_ behind left\r\n     ear, just above posterior root of zygoma; gutter fracture;\r\n     bullet retained within skull. Above and corresponding to right\r\n     frontal eminence there was a haematoma, beneath which a loose\r\n     fragment of bone was readily palpable. When brought into the\r\n     Field hospital, twenty-four hours after the injury, the man\r\n     appeared to understand when spoken to, but made no answers to\r\n     questions. The urine was passed unconsciously, the bowels were\r\n     confined.\r\n\r\n     He was drowsy, the pupils widely dilated, the pulse 68, of good\r\n     strength, and the temperature 104 deg.. He slept well the following\r\n     night and midday there was little change, except that the\r\n     pupils acted to light, and the pulse had risen to 88, becoming\r\n     dicrotic and small. The temperature was 103 deg., the tongue furred\r\n     and dry, but he was lying with the mouth wide open.\r\n\r\n     At 2 P.M. the wound was explored. The entry led down to a\r\n     typical gutter fracture in the squamous portion of the temporal\r\n     bone, at the point of junction of the vertical with the\r\n     horizontal part; the floor of the gutter had been displaced\r\n     inwards as a single fragment (fig. 70). A flap was raised in\r\n     the frontal region, where a scale of outer table (fig. 71),\r\n     clothed with diploic tissue, was found loose. Beneath this a\r\n     puncture on the frontal bone, about corresponding in size to\r\n     the bullet, was discovered. This opening was enlarged, and a\r\n     bullet detected and removed. The bullet was a Guedes, with no\r\n     marks of rifling, and was in no way deformed. At least a square\r\n     inch of the right frontal lobe was pulped, so that the bullet\r\n     lay in a cavity.\r\n\r\n     The patient improved somewhat during the next two days, and on\r\n     the third took a 16 hours' journey to Bloemfontein, where Mr.\r\n     Bowlby (who was present at the operation) kindly took him into\r\n     the Portland Hospital. The pulse gradually rose to 112, the\r\n     temperature remained on an average from 102 deg. to 103 deg., the\r\n     respiration rose to 36, the face became somewhat livid, and on\r\n     the sixth day death occurred rather suddenly, apparently from\r\n     respiratory failure. For two days before his death the patient\r\n     sometimes asked for food, &c.; there was occasional twitching\r\n     of the left angle of the mouth, and, when the posterior wound\r\n     was manipulated, some twitching of the fingers of the left\r\n     hand. When the wound was dressed on the fourth day, there were\r\n     breaking-down blood-clot and signs of incipient suppuration.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Bowlby made a _post-mortem_ examination, and found\r\n     considerable pulping of the tip of the right frontal and left\r\n     temporo-sphenoidal lobes, and a thick layer of haemorrhage\r\n     extending over the whole base of the brain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Scale of outer table of Frontal Bone and\r\nDiploe. Exact size, from fracture shown in fig. 72]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Perforating Fracture of Frontal Bone from\r\nwithin Separation of plate outer table. (Low velocity.) 1/2]\r\n\r\nThe injury to the _cranial contents_ varied with the degree of bone\r\ninjury. Haemorrhage on the surface of the dura may in rare instances have\r\nbeen the sole gross lesion; I never met with such a condition, however.\r\nIn all the cases in which comminution had occurred, some laceration of\r\nthe dura, even if not more than surface damage or a punctiform opening,\r\nhad resulted. In the more serious gutter fractures an elongated rent of\r\nsome extent usually existed. In the perforating fractures two more or\r\nless irregular openings were the rule. The amount of haemorrhage, even if\r\nthe venous sinuses were implicated, was on the whole surprisingly small,\r\nwhen the cases were such as to survive the injury long enough to be\r\nbrought to the Field hospital. I never saw a typical case of middle\r\nmeningeal haemorrhage, although many fractures crossing the line of\r\ndistribution of the large branches came under observation. Case 60, p.\r\n274, illustrated the fact that the osseous lesions of lesser apparent\r\ndegree are sometimes the more to be feared in the matter of haemorrhage,\r\nas compression is more readily developed.\r\n\r\nThe degree of injury to the brain depended on the depth of the track,\r\nthe resistance offered by the bones of any individual skull, the weight\r\nof the patient, but chiefly on the degree of velocity retained by the\r\nbullet. It was sometimes slight and local as far as symptoms would guide\r\nus; but in the majority of cases out of all proportion to the apparent\r\nbone lesion, if the range was at all a short one. Cases illustrative of\r\nthese injuries are included under the heading of symptoms.\r\n\r\nIt will be, of course, appreciated that the coarse brain lesions under\r\nthe third heading differed in localisation and in extent alone, and in\r\nno wise in nature, from those observed in the two preceding classes. The\r\ndamage consisted in direct superficial laceration and contusion, and\r\nbeyond the limits of the area of actual destruction, abundant\r\nparenchymatous haemorrhages more or less broke up the structure of the\r\nbrain, such haemorrhages decreasing both in size and number as\r\nmacroscopically uninjured tissue was reached. No opportunity was ever\r\nafforded of examining a simple wound track in a case in which no obvious\r\ncerebral symptoms had been present.\r\n\r\nIV. _Fractures of the base._--In addition to the above classes, a few\r\nwords ought to be added regarding the gunshot fractures of the base of\r\nthe skull. These possessed some striking peculiarities; first in the\r\nfact that they might occur in any position, and hence differed from the\r\ntypically coursing 'bursting' fractures we are accustomed to in civil\r\nlife as the consequence of blows and falls, and consequently were often\r\npresent without any of the classical symptoms by which we are accustomed\r\nto locate such fissures. Secondly, the peculiar form was not uncommon in\r\nwhich extensive mischief was produced from within by direct contact of a\r\npassing bullet.\r\n\r\nAs far as could be judged from clinical symptoms, indirect fractures of\r\nthe base such as we are accustomed to meet in civil practice in\r\nconnection with fractures of the vault were decidedly rare, and, as has\r\nalready been mentioned, ocular evidence of extensive fissures extending\r\nfrom perforating wounds of the vertex was wanting, except in the extreme\r\ncases classed under heading I. For these reasons I am inclined to regard\r\nthem as uncommon.\r\n\r\nDirect fractures of the base, on the other hand, were of common\r\noccurrence, especially in the anterior fossa of the skull. These might\r\nbe produced either from within, the most characteristic form of gunshot\r\ninjury, or from without. The fractures from within were often simple\r\npunctures of the roof of the orbit or nose.\r\n\r\nPunctured fractures of the roof of the orbit caused little trouble as\r\nfar as the cranium was concerned, but the orbital structures often\r\nsuffered severely. I saw one or two very severe comminutions of the roof\r\nof the orbit caused by bullets which had crossed the interior of the\r\nskull; in one case the whole roof was in small fragments, while the\r\ndamage in others was not greater than chipping off some portion of the\r\nlesser wing of the sphenoid. The roof of the orbit again was sometimes\r\nvery severely damaged by bullets which first traversed that cavity\r\nitself; thus in one case which recovered, the bullet passed\r\ntransversely, smashing both globes, and fracturing the roof of both\r\norbits and the cribriform plate so severely as to lacerate both\r\ndura-mater and brain, portions of the latter being found in the orbit on\r\nremoval of the damaged eyes.\r\n\r\nFractures of the middle and posterior fossae were met with far less\r\nfrequently, partly I think because vertical wounds passing from the\r\nvertex to the base in these regions were with few exceptions rapidly\r\nfatal, and partly from the fact that the occipital region, being\r\nordinarily sheltered from the line of fire, was rarely exposed to the\r\ndanger of direct fracture from without. As an odd coincidence I may\r\nmention that in my whole experience during the war I only once saw\r\nbleeding from the ear as a sign of fracture of the base, apart from\r\ndirect injuries to the tympanum or external auditory meatus.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of fracture of the skull, with concurrent injury to the\r\nbrain._--These consisted in various combinations of the groups of signs\r\nindicative of the conditions of concussion, compression, cerebral\r\nirritation, or destruction. Although the symptoms possessed no inherent\r\npeculiarities, yet certain characteristics exhibited served to\r\nillustrate the fact that, as a result of the special mechanism of\r\ncausation of the injuries, the type deviated in many ways from that\r\naccompanying the corresponding injuries of civil practice.\r\n\r\nThe characters of the external wounds will be first considered, followed\r\nby some remarks concerning the symptoms attendant on the different\r\ndegrees and types of lesion, the symptoms special to injuries to\r\ndifferent regions of the head, and on the subsequent complications\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn the simplest injuries the type forms of entry and exit wound were\r\nfound, and it has already been observed that in these, if symmetrical,\r\nconsiderable difficulty existed in discriminating between the two\r\napertures. This is to be explained by the fact that the arrangement and\r\nstructure of the scalp are identical in corresponding regions; hence the\r\nonly difference in the conditions of production of the entry and exit\r\nwounds exists in the absence of support to the skin in the latter. The\r\ngranular structure of the hairy scalp is opposed to the occurrence of\r\nthe slit forms of exit, hence the openings were usually irregularly\r\nrounded. Any increase of size in the exit wound in the soft parts due to\r\nthe passage of bone fragments with the bullet, was equalised in that of\r\nentry by the fact that the latter, as supported by a hard substratum,\r\nwas usually larger than those met with in situations where the skin\r\ncovers soft parts alone.\r\n\r\nIn some cases of gutter fracture the wounds of entry were large and\r\nirregular, as a result of upward splintering of the bone at the distal\r\nmargin of the aperture of entry in the skull, and consequent laceration\r\nof the scalp. Again, on the forehead very pure types of slit exit wound\r\nwere often met with in the position of the vertical or horizontal\r\ncreases. With higher degrees of velocity on the part of the bullet and\r\nconsequent comminution at the aperture of exit in the bone, the scalp\r\nwas more extensively lacerated, and large irregular openings in the soft\r\nparts, often occupied by fragments of bone and brain pulp, were met\r\nwith. It is well to repeat here, however, that the presence of brain\r\npulp in a wound by no means necessarily indicated the aperture of exit,\r\nfor it was sometimes found in the entry opening also.\r\n\r\nIn the most severe cases, such as are included in class I., the exit\r\nwound often possessed in the highest degree the so-called 'explosive'\r\ncharacter. From an opening in the skin with everted margins two or more\r\ninches in diameter a mass of brain debris, bone fragments and particles\r\nof dura-mater, skin, and hair, bound together by coagulated blood,\r\nprotruded as a primary hernia cerebri if the patient survived the first\r\nfew hours after the injury. In other cases of the same class the actual\r\nopening was smaller, but the whole scalp was swollen and oedematous,\r\nsometimes crackling when touched from the presence of extravasated blood\r\nin the cellular tissue, while firm palpation often gave the impression\r\nthat the head consisted of a bag of bones over a considerable area.\r\n\r\nGutter fractures of the scalp were sometimes situated beneath an open\r\nfurrow, gaping from loss of substance, or beneath a bridge of skin; in\r\nthe latter case they were usually palpable. Simple punctures were also\r\nusually palpable, but the smallness of the openings sometimes rendered\r\ntheir detection more difficult than might be assumed.\r\n\r\nI never saw a case in which the skull escaped injury when the bullet\r\nstruck the scalp at right angles, but the frequency with which Mauser\r\nbullets were found within the helmets of men would suggest that this\r\nmust have sometimes occurred. A case of injury to the external table\r\nalone has been described (p. 243). An illustration of the next degree of\r\ninjury is afforded by the following:--A bullet lodged in the centre of\r\nthe forehead, the point lying within the cranial cavity, while the base\r\nprojected from the surface: this patient suffered but slight immediate\r\ntrouble, so little, indeed, that he merely asked his officer to remove\r\nthe bullet for him, as it was inconvenient. The bullet was subsequently\r\nremoved in the Field hospital.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases the bullet entered the skull and was retained, when only\r\na single wound was found. Such cases are described in Nos. 54 and 68,\r\nwhere the position of the bullet was determined by palpable fractures\r\nbeneath the skin. With regard to the retention of bullets, however, in\r\nsmall-calibre wounds, it was always necessary to examine the other parts\r\nof the body with great care, and to ascertain, if possible, the\r\ndirection from which the wound was received, as an exit was often found\r\nsome distance down the neck or trunk. Again the possibility of the\r\nopening having been produced by glancing contact had to be considered.\r\n\r\nIn cases which survived the injury on the field, free haemorrhage, as in\r\nwounds of other regions, was rare, and although general evidence of loss\r\nof blood was often noted in patients brought in, progressive bleeding\r\nwas seldom observed. Again, when the wounds were explored, the amount of\r\nblood, although considerable, was usually not more than sufficed to fill\r\nup the space consequent on the loss of brain tissue. This was especially\r\nstriking when large venous sinuses, as the superior longitudinal, were\r\ninvolved in the injury. None the less, haemorrhage at the base of the\r\nbrain was, I believe, responsible for early death in many of the severe\r\ncases, especially when the wounds were near the lower regions of the\r\nskull.\r\n\r\nEscape of cerebro-spinal fluid was not so prominent a feature as might\r\nhave been expected, considering how freely the arachnoid space was\r\nopened up in many cases. I think this was usually checked by early\r\ncoagulation of the blood, and later by adhesions. It must be remembered\r\nalso that extensive wounds were most common on the vertex, or at any\r\nrate over the convex surface of the brain, while fractures of the middle\r\nfossa were usually rapidly fatal.\r\n\r\n_Concussion._--Cases exhibiting symptoms of pure uncomplicated\r\nconcussion were distinctly rare, as would be expected from the\r\nmechanism of the injuries. On the other hand, symptoms of concussion\r\nformed the dominant feature of all severe cases.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms in many instances consisted in great part in transitory\r\nsigns of the so-called 'radiation' type, such as are seen in destructive\r\nlesions where the signs of nervous damage rapidly tend to diminish and\r\nlocalise themselves.\r\n\r\nAs to the causation of the 'radiation' symptoms, it is difficult to\r\ndiscriminate the effects of neighbouring parenchymatous haemorrhages from\r\nthose of local vibratory concussion of the nervous tissue. The local\r\ncharacter of the signs seems, however, to point to causation by\r\nmolecular disturbance, resulting from the conduction of forcible\r\nmechanical vibration to the brain tissue rather than to upset in the\r\nintra-cranial pressure. Again the limited nature of the paralysis\r\nobserved, sharply defines it from the general loss of power accompanying\r\nordinary cases of concussion of the brain. The similarity of the\r\nphenomena to those described in other parts of the body under the\r\nheading of 'local shock' is sufficiently obvious.\r\n\r\nThe following instance well exemplifies the condition in question:\r\n\r\n     (55) Wounded at Spion Kop. A scalp wound 3 inches in length\r\n     crossed the left parietal bone nearly transversely, starting\r\n     1-1/2 and ending 2 inches from the median line: the centre of\r\n     the wound corresponded with the position of the fissure of\r\n     Rolando. The patient was struck at a distance of fifty yards\r\n     while kneeling; he fell and remained unconscious an hour and a\r\n     half. Right hemiplegia without aphasia followed. The wound was\r\n     cleansed and sutured, and in three days both arm and leg could\r\n     be moved, after which time the man improved rapidly. Three weeks\r\n     later when I saw him at Wynberg there was still comparative\r\n     weakness of the right side, but beyond some neuralgia of the\r\n     scalp, the man considered himself well. No groove could be\r\n     detected on the bone on palpation. (This case offers a good\r\n     example of the ease with which bone injury may be overlooked.\r\n     The man came over to England 'well;' but while on furlough, two\r\n     pieces of bone came away spontaneously. He is now again on\r\n     active service.)\r\n\r\n_Compression._--Equally rare was it for pure symptoms of compression to\r\nbe exhibited. This depended on two circumstances: first, the rarity of\r\ninjuries giving rise to meningeal haemorrhage; secondly, the fact that in\r\nnearly every case a more or less extensive destructive lesion was\r\npresent, at the margins of which less completely destroyed tissue\r\nremained, capable of giving rise to symptoms of irritation. Again, as we\r\nhave seen, free haemorrhage into, or from the walls of, the cavities\r\nproduced in the brain was not a marked feature, and beyond this the\r\nlarge defect in the cranial parietes was calculated to render a high\r\ndegree of compression impossible.\r\n\r\nAs the most serious head injuries presented a remarkable similarity in\r\ntheir symptoms, I will shortly summarise their common features.\r\n\r\nEvery degree of mental stupor up to complete unconsciousness was met\r\nwith, but in some instances where the pulse, respiration, and general\r\nbodily condition pointed to speedy dissolution, the patients answered\r\nrationally often between moans or cries indicative of pain.\r\n\r\nWidespread paralysis often existed, but this was seldom completely\r\ngeneral; more commonly it was combined with extreme restlessness of the\r\nunparalysed parts, or sometimes, even when the whole of one hemisphere\r\nwas tunnelled, and in all probability widely destroyed, restlessness was\r\nthe only symptom. In some cases twitching of the features or the limbs\r\nor severe convulsions were superadded.\r\n\r\nThe pupils were rarely unequal, and at the stage in which these patients\r\nwere first seen were usually moderately contracted. Wide dilatation was\r\nuncommon throughout.\r\n\r\nThe pulse was with very few exceptions slow, sometimes irregular. In\r\nsome instances, when the wounds had been thought suitable for\r\nexploration, the slow pulse was altered after operation to a rapid one,\r\nand death usually quickly supervened.\r\n\r\nRespiration was irregular, sometimes sighing; in the late stage often of\r\nthe Cheyne-Stokes type; actual stertor was exceptional, but the\r\nrespiration was often noisy.\r\n\r\nThe temperature was often raised from an early stage to 99 deg. or 100 deg., and\r\nif the patient survived a day or two, it often rose to 103 deg. or 104 deg.. How\r\nfar the secondary rise depended on sepsis it was not always easy to\r\ndetermine. The urine was usually retained.\r\n\r\nCases presenting the above characters were usually those suffering from\r\nlesions such as are described in class I., and mostly died in\r\ntwenty-four to forty-eight hours. The correspondence of the train of\r\nsymptoms with those due to combined brain destruction and severe\r\nconcussion is at once apparent.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the nature of the symptoms in patients suffering from the\r\nless extensive forms of injury, such as those included in classes II.\r\nand III. under the heading of anatomical lesion, the relation of a short\r\nseries of histories will be advisable. I may first premise, however,\r\nthat the special characteristics of these were in some instances the\r\nalmost entire absence of primary symptoms of gravity; in others general\r\nsymptoms of a severity out of apparent proportion to the external\r\nlesion; while in all destructive lesions, very widely distributed\r\nradiation symptoms developed, often disappearing with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms consisted in those of concussion, irritation, local\r\npressure, and actual destruction.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of concussion were either general, and then usually\r\ntransient, or local paralysis of the radiation variety, which also\r\nrapidly improved.\r\n\r\nSigns of irritation consisted in irritability of temper, drowsiness,\r\nclosure of the eyes and objection to light, contracted pupils sometimes\r\nunequal, a tendency to the assumption of the flexed position at all the\r\njoints, twitchings, and sometimes convulsions. Sometimes these appeared\r\nearly as a direct result of mechanical irritation from bone fragments or\r\nblood-clot; sometimes only in the course of a few days, as a result of\r\nirritation of parts recovering from the radiation effects which had\r\nprevented earlier nervous reaction. Possibly in some cases the symptoms\r\nof irritation depended upon an increase in the amount of haemorrhage, and\r\nin others upon the development of local inflammatory changes.\r\n\r\nLocal pressure, or actual destruction of brain tissue, was evidenced by\r\ntemporary paralysis in the former, permanent loss of function in the\r\nlatter, condition.\r\n\r\nFractures of the anterior fossa of the skull were attended by very\r\nmarked evidence of orbital haemorrhage, as subconjunctival ecchymosis\r\n(rarely pure), increased tension, and proptosis.\r\n\r\nInjuries to the cranial nerves at the base, with the single exception of\r\nlesion of the optic nerves, which was not rare, were in my experience\r\nuncommon in the hospitals--a fact pointing to the very fatal nature of\r\ndirect basal injuries, except in the anterior fossa of the skull. Signs\r\nindicative of injury to the olfactory lobe were occasionally observed.\r\n\r\nI should, perhaps, again insist here on the rarity with which acute\r\ndiffuse septic infection occurred in cases of these degrees of severity,\r\nalso on the fact that interference with the wounds in the way of\r\nsecondary exploration, even when they were manifestly the seat of local\r\ninfection, was followed almost without exception by good immediate\r\nresults; and, lastly, that when suppuration did occur, it was usually\r\nstrictly local in character. The influence of the climate of South\r\nAfrica and our surroundings has already been discussed, but whether\r\nclimate, condition of the patients, or peculiarity in the nature of\r\ncausation of the wounds was responsible, in no series of cases was the\r\nabsence of acute inflammatory troubles more striking than in this one of\r\nbrain injuries.\r\n\r\nFrontal injuries were those most frequently unaccompanied by primary\r\nsymptoms of severity; slowing of the pulse--this often fell to 40--and\r\noccasional irregularity, were almost the only constant signs of cerebral\r\ndamage. Some patients temporarily lost consciousness, others rose at\r\nonce and walked to the dressing station, and in few cases was any\r\npsychical disturbance noted in the early stages.\r\n\r\nI think, however, it may be affirmed that frontal injuries, accompanied\r\nby trivial signs, resulted without exception from the passage of bullets\r\ntravelling at a low rate of velocity. Thus in several of the instances\r\nhere related the patients at the time of reception of the wound were\r\nunder the impression that they were entirely beyond the range of fire,\r\nand in one, in which well-marked signs of concussion followed, the\r\nbullet, which had traversed the head, retained only sufficient force to\r\nperforate the skin of the neck and bury itself in the posterior\r\ntriangle without even fracturing the clavicle, against which it\r\nimpinged. In men struck at a shorter range, signs of concussion, often\r\nfollowed by transient radiation signs of injury to the parietal lobe,\r\nwere common. These signs were, I think, not as a rule due to surface\r\nhaemorrhage, since they were of a purely paralytic nature and not\r\nirritative. Several cases with partial or complete hemiplegia,\r\nhemiplegia and aphasia, or facial paralysis are recorded below.\r\n\r\n     (56) _Frontal injury_.--Wounded at Magersfontein. In prone\r\n     position when struck, distance 700 to 800 yards. _Entry_\r\n     (Mauser), at the margin of the hairy scalp above and to the\r\n     left of the frontal eminence; course, through anterior third of\r\n     left frontal lobe, roof of orbit, obliquely across line of\r\n     optic nerve, inner wall of orbit, nose, right superior maxilla\r\n     piercing alveolar process, and passing superficial to inferior\r\n     maxilla: _exit_, one inch anterior to angle of jaw. The bullet\r\n     again entered the posterior triangle of the neck, struck the\r\n     right clavicle, and turned a somersault, so that its base lay\r\n     deepest in the wound.\r\n\r\n     The patient was unconscious for a short time, suffered with\r\n     general headache and giddiness, and was somewhat irritable. On\r\n     the third day the pulse was 70, temperature normal, and he was\r\n     sent to the Base. There was considerable proptosis, oedema\r\n     and discoloration of the eyelid, and subconjunctival\r\n     ecchymosis, but the movements of the eyeball could be made and\r\n     light could be distinguished. The sense of smell was apparently\r\n     absent. A week later the headache was gone, the pulse numbered\r\n     80 to 90, the temperature was normal, he slept well, sat up in\r\n     bed and smoked, took his food well, and exhibited no cerebral\r\n     symptoms. He could detect the smell of tobacco, but not as a\r\n     definite odour.\r\n\r\n     No further symptoms were noted, the sense of smell returned,\r\n     the swelling of the eyelid and proptosis decreased, but the\r\n     upper lid could not be raised. When the lid was drawn up, there\r\n     appeared to be vision at the margins of the field with a large\r\n     central blind spot. The patient left for England at the end of\r\n     a month apparently well.\r\n\r\n     (57) _Gutter fracture of frontal bone._--Wounded at Paardeberg.\r\n     _Entry_ (Mauser), 3/4 of an inch within the margin of hairy\r\n     scalp above outer extremity of right eyebrow; gutter fracture;\r\n     _exit_, 2 inches nearer middle line, at the same distance from\r\n     the margin of the hairy scalp. The patient was knocked head\r\n     over heels, his main feeling being a sense of dulness in the\r\n     right great toe. He sat up and got a first field dressing\r\n     applied, then lay down, but as he was still under fire, he\r\n     retired 1,000 yards to the collecting station; here he dressed\r\n     some patients, and later mounted an ambulance wagon and was\r\n     driven to the Field hospital. The next day he helped with the\r\n     work of the hospital, amongst other things controlling the\r\n     artery during an amputation of the arm. He then took a three\r\n     days' and nights' journey to Modder River in a bullock wagon,\r\n     during which journey he had a fit, which was general, the\r\n     thumbs being turned in and a wedge being necessary between the\r\n     teeth to prevent him biting his tongue.\r\n\r\n     On the sixth day the wound was examined, and between this and\r\n     the tenth day he had several fits of the same nature as the\r\n     first, accompanied by stertorous breathing and profuse\r\n     sweating. On the tenth day Mr. Cheatle opened up the wound and\r\n     removed numerous fragments of bone, leaving a clean gutter 2\r\n     inches by 3/4 of an inch. After the operation no further fits\r\n     occurred, and eight days later he was conscious, but was\r\n     excitable and talked at random. On the twentieth day he arrived\r\n     at the Base after 30 hours' railway journey (623 miles). He was\r\n     then quite rational, but unable to make any demands on his\r\n     memory and very sensitive to noise; at times he wandered in the\r\n     evenings and his temperature rose as high as 100 deg.. The wound\r\n     was open and granulating, the floor pulsating freely.\r\n\r\n     Three weeks later the wound was still open, and the skin dipped\r\n     in at the lower margin. The mental condition was much improved,\r\n     although attempts at giving a history of his case were\r\n     obviously tiresome.\r\n\r\n     The wounds in the leather headband of this patient's helmet\r\n     were interesting, the round aperture of entry in the exterior\r\n     of the helmet being followed by a starred exit aperture in the\r\n     leather band, the second entry opening in the leather band\r\n     being again circular, and the external opening in the puggaree\r\n     a transverse slit.\r\n\r\n     (58) _Transverse superficial perforating frontal\r\n     injury._--Wounded at Graspan. Aperture of _entry_\r\n     (Lee-Metford), at upper and outer part of left frontal\r\n     eminence; _exit_, at margin of hairy scalp over outer third of\r\n     right eyebrow. On the second day the patient complained of\r\n     giddiness and headache; the pulse was 60. He was then walking\r\n     about. The wounds were explored and typical entry and exit\r\n     apertures discovered in the frontal bone from which cerebral\r\n     matter was protruding. Both openings were enlarged (Mr. S. W.\r\n     F. Richardson) with Hoffman's forceps, and a considerable\r\n     number of splinters of the inner table were removed from the\r\n     aperture of entry.\r\n\r\n     The headache gradually passed off, but there was throbbing\r\n     about the scar, and pulsation was visible for some three weeks,\r\n     after which no further symptoms were observed.\r\n\r\n     (59) _Oblique frontal gutter fracture._--Wounded at\r\n     Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1/2 an inch to right of median\r\n     line of forehead, 3/4 of an inch from the margin of the hairy\r\n     scalp; _exit_, about 3/4 of an inch anterior to the lower\r\n     extremity of the right fissure of Rolando. Weakness of left\r\n     facial muscles, especially of angle of mouth. No further motor\r\n     symptoms. Wounds explored (Mr. Stewart); numerous fragments of\r\n     bone and some pulped cerebral matter were removed. Patient\r\n     developed no further signs; the paralysis, although improved,\r\n     did not completely disappear. The man a year later was still on\r\n     active duty, the paralysis almost well, and no further ill\r\n     effects of the injury remained.\r\n\r\nIn the fronto-parietal or parietal regions, signs of damage to the\r\ncortical motor area were seldom absent, sometimes evanescent, at others\r\nprolonged. In some cases the signs were permanent and followed by\r\nevidence of local sclerosis.\r\n\r\nThe motor area on both sides of the brain was sometimes implicated; thus\r\nin a child shot at Kimberley the bullet entered in the right frontal\r\nregion, and emerged to the left of the line connecting bregma and inion\r\na little behind its centre. Paralysis of both lower extremities\r\nresulted, power rapidly returning in the right, while incomplete\r\nparalysis persisted in the left.\r\n\r\nIn only one instance (see case 73, p. 292) was any permanent sensory\r\ndefect observed, and the mental condition of this patient would have\r\ncertainly suggested a functional explanation for its presence, had it\r\nnot been for the accompanying inequality in the axillary surface\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nIn a second case (No. 67) blunting of sensation followed a definite\r\nlesion of the inferior parietal lobule. In this instance an occipital\r\nlesion was associated with the parietal.\r\n\r\n     (60) _Parietal gutter fracture._--Wounded at Magersfontein. A\r\n     scalp wound 3 inches in length ran transversely across the\r\n     right parietal bone at the level of the lower third of the\r\n     fissure of Rolando. A second wound of entry was found crossing\r\n     the third dorsal spine; the bullet was retained and was\r\n     palpable over the right scapula. There was left facial\r\n     paralysis, weakness and numbness of both upper extremities,\r\n     especially of the left, and some difficulty in swallowing. The\r\n     man was sent to the Base, where he arrived on the fourth day.\r\n     The symptoms had then become much more marked, consciousness\r\n     was incomplete, and articulation slow and imperfect. There was\r\n     complete left hemiplegia, and deviation of the tongue to the\r\n     right. The pulse was 40. An exploration (Mr. J. J. Day) showed\r\n     that an oval plate of the outer table of the parietal bone had\r\n     been struck off. A trephine was applied to the exposed diploe\r\n     and a crown of bone removed; considerable comminution of the\r\n     inner table had occurred, several large fragments having\r\n     perforated the dura-mater. The latter did not pulsate; it was\r\n     therefore freely incised, and many more fragments of bone and a\r\n     large quantity of blood-clot removed.\r\n\r\n     The first effect of the operation was slight, but ten days\r\n     later rapid improvement commenced, the first sign being\r\n     acceleration of the pulse, which rose to 70. On the eighteenth\r\n     day the original symptoms still remained to a diminished\r\n     extent, but a fortnight later there remained traces of the\r\n     facial weakness only, and there was little difference in the\r\n     grip of the two hands. The patient was shortly afterwards sent\r\n     home. Ten months later he returned to South Africa on active\r\n     service.\r\n\r\n     (61) _Fronto-parietal gutter fracture._--Wounded at Graspan.\r\n     _Entry_ (Mauser), 1 inch within the margin of the hairy scalp,\r\n     1/2 an inch to the left of the median line; _exit_, 3-1/2\r\n     inches posterior in same line. Complete right-sided hemiplegia.\r\n     The wounds were explored on the fourth day (Major Moffatt,\r\n     R.A.M.C.) and a gutter fracture involving the frontal and\r\n     parietal bones exposed. The dura-mater was lacerated and brain\r\n     matter from the frontal lobe escaped freely. A large number of\r\n     bone fragments were removed. On the fourth day after the\r\n     operation, the patient became unconscious with right-sided\r\n     twitchings, but rapidly improved, and at the end of three\r\n     weeks, except for slight headache, he was well, the power of\r\n     the right side being good. Ten months later he rejoined his\r\n     regiment in South Africa, no apparent ill effects remaining.\r\n\r\n     (62) _Fronto-parietal perforating fracture._--Wounded at\r\n     Magersfontein. _Entry_, within the margin of the hairy scalp;\r\n     _exit_, behind and below the left parietal eminence, the track\r\n     crossing about the centre of the fissure of Rolando. Right\r\n     hemiplegia, the lower half of the face only being involved. The\r\n     wounds were explored and a large number of fragments of bone\r\n     and a quantity of pulped cerebral matter removed. Six days\r\n     later the hemiplegia persisted, speech was slow, headache was\r\n     troublesome and the pulse not above 45. After this, gradual\r\n     improvement took place, and a month later the lower extremity\r\n     and face had regained good power. The upper extremity remained\r\n     flaccid and paralysed, except for some slight power of movement\r\n     of the shoulder.\r\n\r\n     (63) _Fronto-parietal perforating fracture._--Wounded at\r\n     Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 2-1/2 inches from the median\r\n     line, 3-1/2 inches from the occipital protuberance; _exit_, 3/4\r\n     of an inch from the median line, 4-1/2 inches from the\r\n     glabella; sanious fluid escaped from both ears. There was left\r\n     facial paralysis, complete paralysis of the left upper\r\n     extremity, and partial paralysis of the left lower extremity.\r\n     The patient was deaf, drowsy, and the pulse 45.\r\n\r\n     Exploration showed the entry wound to be in the parietal, the\r\n     exit to involve both parietal and frontal bones. The openings\r\n     were enlarged, and a number of fragments of bone, together with\r\n     pulped cerebral matter and blood-clot, were removed. The wound\r\n     healed, except at the front part, where a small prominence\r\n     suggested a hernia cerebri.\r\n\r\n     The patient improved slowly; fourteen days after the operation\r\n     he could hear well, and the flow from the ears had ceased. The\r\n     facial weakness was slight, the upper extremity was still\r\n     powerless, but he could move the lower and draw it up in bed.\r\n     At the end of six weeks the wound had healed, and he was got up\r\n     and dressed.\r\n\r\n     At the end of two months he was well enough to be sent home;\r\n     there was only a trace of facial weakness; the right upper\r\n     extremity, however, was powerless and slightly rigid,\r\n     occasional twitchings occurring in it. Considerable power had\r\n     been regained in the lower extremity, so that the patient could\r\n     walk with help, but foot-drop persisted; the gait was spastic\r\n     in character, the reflexes were much exaggerated, and there was\r\n     marked clonus. The patient was sensible, but his manner\r\n     suggested some mental weakness. Both the openings in the skull\r\n     were closed by very firm material, apparently bony.\r\n\r\n     This patient became a Commissionaire some ten months later. His\r\n     mental condition is normal, and loss of memory seems confined\r\n     to the events immediately following the injury. The lower\r\n     extremity has improved, but the upper is useless.\r\n\r\n     (64) _Parietal injury: retained bullet._--Wounded at\r\n     Paardeberg. Aperture of _entry_ (Mauser), 1 inch diagonally\r\n     below and anterior to left parietal eminence. No exit. The\r\n     patient was trephined by the surgeons of the German ambulance\r\n     at Jacobsdal.\r\n\r\n     Sixteen days later he arrived at the Base. A circular pulsating\r\n     trephine opening was then to be felt beneath the flap, but no\r\n     information was forthcoming as to the bullet. The patient\r\n     could speak, but lost words and the gist of sentences; he\r\n     could remember nothing as to himself since the day of the\r\n     injury. There was right facial weakness; he could not close the\r\n     right eye or whistle, but there was little apparent want of\r\n     symmetry; there was weakness in the grip of both hands, more\r\n     marked on the right side; both lower extremities could be\r\n     moved. The reflexes were normal, although the left limb was\r\n     slightly rigid. The pupils were equal, reflex normal; slight\r\n     nystagmus. Pulse 72, small and regular. Temperature normal.\r\n     Rapid improvement followed.\r\n\r\n     During the fourth week the temperature rose to 103 deg., and\r\n     remained elevated for six days, but no local or general signs\r\n     appeared; at the end of five weeks there was little evidence of\r\n     the paralysis remaining. The patient was discharged from the\r\n     service on his return home.\r\n\r\nIn the upper part of the occipital region glancing or superficial\r\ninjuries were comparatively favourable; those near the base, especially\r\nif perforating, were very dangerous. Two such cases are referred to\r\nelsewhere. Case 69 is included as the only example of cerebellar injury\r\nI happened to see who lived any appreciable time after the accident.\r\n\r\nThe main interest in these cases centres in the defects produced in the\r\narea of the visual field. I am extremely indebted to my colleague, Mr.\r\nJ. H. Fisher, who has kindly determined this for me in three of the\r\nfollowing cases. It will be noted that in two instances the injury was\r\nto the left occipital lobe. In these the resulting hemianopsia was of\r\nthe pure lateral homonymous character, and in both the visual symptoms\r\nwere accompanied by a certain degree of amnesic aphasia (65 and 68).\r\n\r\nIn 65 the injury was definitely unilateral, and at the time of the\r\noperation I decided that at least an inch and a half of the posterior\r\nextremity of the left occipital lobe was totally destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn 68 the lesion was probably confined to the left lobe, but it is\r\nimpossible to exclude slight injury to the right lobe also. In this\r\ninstance amnesic aphasia was a far more marked symptom than in 65, and\r\nthe position of the lesion suggested damage both to the visual and\r\nauditory word centres.\r\n\r\nCases 66 and 67 are instances of damage to both occipital lobes. In 66,\r\nalthough the wound was a glancing one, and did not perforate, it was so\r\nnear the median line, and accompanied by such severe damage to the bone,\r\nthat a symmetrical lesion of the cuneate and precuneate lobules of both\r\nright and left sides is to be inferred. In 67 the great longitudinal\r\nfissure was traversed by the bullet obliquely. It is of great interest\r\nto observe that in each of these cases the lesion of the visual field\r\nwas a horizontal one and affected the lower half in place of assuming a\r\nlateral distribution.\r\n\r\nIn all four cases the primary effect of the occipital injury was the\r\nsame--viz. absolute blindness--while the return of vision in each was of\r\nthe nature of the dawning of light. I regret that I am unable to furnish\r\nany detail as to increase of the field of vision in the progress of the\r\ncases, but circumstances rendered continuous observation of the patients\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIn each case deafness was apparently the direct result of concussion of\r\nthe ear on the side corresponding to the wound. Deafness of the opposite\r\near was never noted.\r\n\r\nIn case 67 some general blunting of sensation was noted in the paralysed\r\nupper extremity, and in this patient, no doubt, injury to the inferior\r\nparietal lobule accompanied the occipital lesion.\r\n\r\n     (65) _Injury to left occipital lobe._--Wounded at Belmont. A\r\n     single transverse wound, 2 inches in length, extended across\r\n     the occipital bone, 2 inches above the level of the external\r\n     protuberance. When seen on the third day the wound was gaping\r\n     and pulped cerebral matter was found in it. The patient was\r\n     very drowsy, lying with closed eyes, and complaining of great\r\n     coronal and frontal headache. He could distinguish light and\r\n     darkness, but not persons. Total blindness immediately followed\r\n     the injury, persisting some three days, and the patient spoke\r\n     of return of sight as of the appearance of dawn. The pupils\r\n     were equal, moderately dilated and acted to light, which was\r\n     unpleasant to him. He was somewhat irritable and silent, but\r\n     apparently rational. Temperature 99 deg.. Pulse 56 full. Tongue\r\n     clean. No sickness, no difficulty in micturition.\r\n\r\n     Fifty-six hours after the injury the wound was opened up and\r\n     cleaned, and an oval fractured opening about 3/4 by 1/2 inch\r\n     was exposed 3/4 inch to the left, and 2 inches above the\r\n     occipital protuberance. The margins of the opening showed\r\n     several small fragments of lead attached to the bone. A\r\n     3/4-inch trephine was applied at the left extremity of the\r\n     opening, and it was found that about a square inch of the\r\n     internal table was comminuted and driven into the brain,\r\n     together with several small fragments of lead. On introducing\r\n     the finger, about 1-1/2 square inches of the occipital lobe\r\n     were found to be pulped, and the finger could be swept across\r\n     the tentorium. There was no sinus haemorrhage (nor did the\r\n     history suggest that haemorrhage had ever been severe). The\r\n     cavity was carefully sponged out, and the wound closed with a\r\n     drainage aperture. Little change followed in the patient's\r\n     condition, and on the sixth day he was sent to the Base\r\n     hospital.\r\n\r\n     Three weeks later the wound was firmly healed. The patient\r\n     still complained of frontal headache, and wore a shade, as the\r\n     light hurt his eyes and made them water freely. The pupils\r\n     acted, but were wide; objects could be distinguished, and also\r\n     persons. Otherwise, the man's condition was good: he began to\r\n     get up, and at the end of six weeks returned to England.\r\n\r\n     A year later the man was earning his living as a Commissionaire\r\n     porter. He complains of giddiness when he stoops, or when he\r\n     looks upwards, and at times he suffers much with headache both\r\n     in the region of the injury and across the temples.\r\n\r\n     There is a bony defect and slight pulsation at the site of the\r\n     injury, but no prominence. When attempts are made to read the\r\n     lines run together, and a dark shadow comes before his eyes. He\r\n     speaks of the latter as still terribly weak. Speech is slow and\r\n     somewhat simple, but he makes no mistakes as to words. Memory\r\n     is bad for recent events.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Fisher makes the following report as to the eyes: Pupils\r\n     and movement of eyes normal in every respect. No changes in\r\n     fundi.\r\n\r\n          Vision, R. 5/12 with--0.5   5/6\r\n                  L. 5/9  with--0.5   5/5\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Right Visual Field, in case 65. Injury to left\r\noccipital lobe. Field for white. Test spot 10 mm. Good daylight. Right\r\nhomonymous hemianopsia]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Left Visual Field, case 65]\r\n\r\n     There is therefore practically full direct vision. Though the\r\n     man chooses a concave glass he is not really myopic. There is\r\n     typical right homonymous hemianopsia; the answers, when tested\r\n     with the perimeter, are quite certain, and the fields\r\n     absolutely reliable.\r\n\r\n     The man's statements confirm the condition; he is aware of his\r\n     inability to see objects to his right-hand side, and is apt to\r\n     collide with persons or objects on that side.\r\n\r\n     The lesion is one of the left occipital cortex in the cuneate\r\n     lobe and the neighbourhood of the calcarine fissure. The speech\r\n     suggests a slight degree of aphasia.\r\n\r\n     (66) _Injury to occipital lobes._--Wounded at Magersfontein\r\n     while in prone position. Distance, 500 yards. He says he was\r\n     never unconscious, but for two days was absolutely blind. His\r\n     eyesight gradually improved, but headache was very severe, and\r\n     sleeplessness nearly absolute. On the eighth day the wound,\r\n     which was situated over the right posterior superior angle of\r\n     the parietal bone, was opened up, and a number of fragments of\r\n     bone and a quantity of pulped brain removed from a depressed\r\n     punctured fracture, surrounded by an annular fissure,\r\n     completely encircling it, 1-1/2 inch from the opening. The\r\n     portion of brain destroyed was probably a considerable portion\r\n     of the cuneate and precuneate lobules of both sides, as well as\r\n     a portion of the first occipital convolution, and the superior\r\n     parietal lobule of the right side. There was no evidence of\r\n     injury to the superior longitudinal sinus in the way of\r\n     haemorrhage.\r\n\r\n     After the operation the patient slept better, but still\r\n     complained of headache, and when he arrived at the Base, the\r\n     flap became oedematous, and the stitch holes and also the\r\n     central part of the wound suppurated. The temperature rose to\r\n     101 deg.. The wound was therefore re-opened, and a number of\r\n     additional fragments of bone, some as deeply situated as 2\r\n     inches from the surface, were removed. Steady improvement\r\n     followed, and at the end of a further three weeks the wound was\r\n     healed, the headache had ceased, and there were no abnormal\r\n     symptoms, except that light was unpleasant to the right eye,\r\n     and the field of vision was manifestly contracted (Mr. Pooley).\r\n\r\n     A year later the man was employed as a letter-carrier. He\r\n     complains of headache at times, and on six occasions has had\r\n     'fainting fits.' He says that the latter commence with tremor,\r\n     that his legs then give way and he falls. In a quarter of an\r\n     hour he gets up, and feels no further inconvenience. Speech is\r\n     perfect, there is no deafness. The bone defect is very nearly\r\n     completely closed.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Fisher reports as follows as to the vision. There is a high\r\n     degree of hypermetropia in each eye, the R. has nearly 6.0 D\r\n     and the L. about 5.0 D. With correction he gets practically\r\n     full direct vision with each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Right Visual Field, in case 66. Injury to both\r\noccipital lobes. Field for white. Test spot 10 mm. Good artificial\r\nlight. Defect in field complicated by functional symptoms]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Left Visual Field, in case 66. Defect in lower\r\nhalf of field]\r\n\r\n     The patient has been examined before, and has been informed\r\n     that his vision quite incapacitates him from further service.\r\n     He began by stating that he could not see on either side of\r\n     him, but only straight in front; that he is apt to collide with\r\n     people in walking, was nearly knocked down by a horse, and that\r\n     his acquaintances accuse him of passing them unnoticed. The\r\n     fields of vision are very small, but the loss is not typically\r\n     in the temporal half of either. That of the right eye which we\r\n     know as the spiral field, becoming more and more contracted as\r\n     the perimeter test is continued, is what is found in functional\r\n     cases; that of the left, however, shows a characteristic loss\r\n     of the lower part of the field of vision, and agrees with the\r\n     statement of the man that he can see the upper part of my face\r\n     but not the lower when he looks at me. Such a loss agrees with\r\n     a lesion involving the upper part of the cuneate lobe above the\r\n     calcarine fissure.\r\n\r\n     I feel satisfied that there is considerable loss in the right\r\n     field also, but the functional element obscures its exact\r\n     nature.\r\n\r\n     The fundi, pupils, and ocular movements are all normal.\r\n\r\n     (67) _Injury to occipital lobes and left motor and sensory\r\n     areas._--Wounded outside Lindley (Spitzkop). Range within 1,000\r\n     yards. _Entry_, one inch within the right lateral angle of the\r\n     occipital bone, external wound more than 1/2 an inch in\r\n     diameter; _exit_, 2 inches from the median line, over the upper\r\n     half of the left fissure of Rolando. Behind the wound of exit\r\n     comminution of the parietal bone, extending back to the\r\n     lambdoid suture, existed. I attributed this to oblique lateral\r\n     impact by the bullet on the inner surface of the skull.\r\n\r\n     The patient could afterwards remember being struck, but became\r\n     rapidly unconscious. When brought into the Field hospital some\r\n     five hours later the condition was as follows: Semi-conscious,\r\n     can speak, apparently blind, pupils equal, of moderate size, do\r\n     not react to light. Right hemiplegia. No sickness. Moans with\r\n     pain in head. Passes water normally.\r\n\r\n     Considerable haemorrhage had occurred from each wound, the scalp\r\n     was puffy, and the bones yielded on pressure over the left\r\n     parietal bone, indicating considerable comminution.\r\n\r\n     The night was so cold that no operation could be considered, so\r\n     the head was partly shaved, the wounds cleansed, and a dressing\r\n     applied. The next morning the Division marched at 5 A.M., and\r\n     it was considered wise to leave the man at Lindley in the local\r\n     hospital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Right Visual Field, in case 67. Injury to both\r\noccipital lobes. Field for white. Test spot 10 mm. Good artificial\r\nlight. Defect in lower half of field]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Left Visual Field, in case 67]\r\n\r\n     No operation was performed there, but I heard later that the\r\n     man recovered full consciousness at the end of five days, and\r\n     at the end of a fortnight he commenced to see again.\r\n\r\n     Six weeks later he travelled to Kroonstadt, thence to\r\n     Bloemfontein, and thence to Cape Town and home to Netley. The\r\n     paralytic symptoms meanwhile steadily improved.\r\n\r\n     Seven months later his condition is as follows: Scarcely a\r\n     trace of facial paralysis. Slight power of movement of arm,\r\n     forearm, and fingers, but grip is very weak. Little power of\r\n     abduction of the shoulder or of straightening the elbow. The\r\n     latter movement is made with effort and in jerks. Sensation\r\n     over the back of the arm is somewhat lowered, and is 'furry' at\r\n     the finger tips. There is very little wasting of the muscles\r\n     noticeable.\r\n\r\n     Walks well, but with some foot-drop. Slight increase of\r\n     patellar reflex. He says that he does not walk in the street\r\n     with confidence, as he often feels as if omnibuses &c. were\r\n     coming too near him.\r\n\r\n     He is absolutely deaf in the right ear.\r\n\r\n     The openings in the skull are closed, the occipital lies about\r\n     halfway between the external auditory meatus and the external\r\n     occipital protuberance, while the parietal still affords\r\n     evidence of the earlier comminution, one fissure passing\r\n     backwards as far as the lambda, and the whole surface is lumpy\r\n     and uneven.\r\n\r\n     The track through the brain no doubt involved a considerable\r\n     extent of the outer aspect of the right occipital lobe and the\r\n     cuneate lobule. It must also have crossed the great\r\n     longitudinal fissure, and penetrated the left Rolandic region,\r\n     just above its centre, probably involving the precuneate\r\n     lobule, and a portion of the internal capsular fibres as well\r\n     as the cortex on the left side. The deafness was probably due\r\n     to concussion of the internal ear.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Fisher has kindly furnished the following note regarding\r\n     the vision. The pupils, movements, and fundi are quite healthy.\r\n     There is good direct vision R. or L. 5/5 fairly, and together\r\n     5/5. The man complains he has lost his side sight, also the\r\n     lower; he demonstrates the latter quite obviously with his\r\n     hand, and says he has to repeatedly look down when walking. He\r\n     thinks no improvement has taken place during the last month.\r\n     The accompanying fields of vision show the loss quite\r\n     characteristically.\r\n\r\n     (68) _Injury to left occipital lobe._--Wounded at Paardeberg.\r\n     _Entry_ (Mauser), through the lambdoid suture on the right side\r\n     of the mid line. Bullet retained, but a palpable prominence\r\n     behind the left ear suggested its localisation.\r\n\r\n     The patient became at once unconscious and remained so for\r\n     several days. He was completely blind; vision returned later,\r\n     but only to a limited degree. There was complete loss of\r\n     memory as to the events of the day.\r\n\r\n     When admitted at Rondebosch into No. 3 General Hospital the\r\n     condition was as follows: The field of vision is limited, and\r\n     examination shows right homonymous hemianopsia. When any one\r\n     comes into the tent the patient sees a shadow only until his\r\n     bed is reached.\r\n\r\n     When spoken to the patient 'thinks and thinks,' and then\r\n     apologises for not answering, saying he will remember at some\r\n     future time. He is absolutely unable to remember times, names,\r\n     or localities, but places his hand to his head and appears to\r\n     think deeply in the effort to recall them. Occasionally when\r\n     you go into his tent he suddenly remembers something he has\r\n     been trying to think of for some days, and will tell you.\r\n\r\n     A fortnight later after an attack of influenza the patient was\r\n     not so well, and vision was apparently becoming more impaired.\r\n\r\n     An incision was made (Mr. J. E. Ker) so as to raise a flap the\r\n     centre of the convexity of which was 2-1/2 inches behind the\r\n     left external auditory meatus. A slight prominence and a\r\n     fissure was discovered in the temporal bone, and over this a\r\n     trephine was applied. On removal of the crown of bone the\r\n     bullet was discovered with the point turned backwards (having\r\n     evidently undergone a partial ricochet turn) on the upper\r\n     surface of the petrous bone, just above the lateral sinus. The\r\n     dura-mater was healed but thickened, and some clot upon its\r\n     surface was removed.\r\n\r\n     The wound healed per primam, and a rapid recovery was made. Ten\r\n     days later a running water-tap was able to be detected 120\r\n     yards from the tent door. The hemianopsia however persisted.\r\n\r\nThe following letter, dictated by the patient to his wife, and sent to\r\nme, gives a clear account of his condition ten months later:--\r\n\r\n     I am pleased to say my memory is better than it was some time\r\n     ago, though at times I am entirely lost and really forget all\r\n     that I was speaking about. I also find that I often call things\r\n     and places by their wrong names. I sometimes try to read a\r\n     paper or book which I have to read letter by letter, sometimes\r\n     calling out the wrong letter, such as B for D &c., and by the\r\n     time I have read almost halfway through, I have forgotten the\r\n     commencement.\r\n\r\n     My sight is about the same. There is no improvement in the\r\n     right eye, and the doctor at Stoke said that the left eye was\r\n     not as it ought to be and might get worse.\r\n\r\n     I ofttimes go to take up a thing, but find I am not near to it,\r\n     though it appears to me so.\r\n\r\n     I have no pain to speak of in the head, though at times a\r\n     shooting pain.\r\n\r\n     I have a continual noise in the left ear as if of a locomotive\r\n     blowing off steam, and a deafness in the left ear which I had\r\n     not before being wounded.\r\n\r\nI am extremely indebted to my friend Mr. J. Errington Ker for the notes\r\nof the above case, so successfully treated by him.\r\n\r\n     (69) _Injury to occipital lobe._--Wounded at Modder River.\r\n     Scalp wound in occipital region. Two days later on arrival at\r\n     the Base the patient was extremely restless and in a condition\r\n     of noisy delirium. The wound was explored (Mr. J. J. Day) and a\r\n     vertical gutter fracture discovered 1/2 an inch above and to\r\n     the left of the occipital protuberance. The gutter was 1-1/2\r\n     inch in length and finely comminuted, the dura wounded, and the\r\n     left occipital lobe pulped. A number of fragments of bone (one\r\n     lodged in the wall of, but not penetrating, the lateral sinus)\r\n     and pulped brain were removed. No improvement took place in the\r\n     general condition, but the patient lived twenty-two days,\r\n     during which time he coughed up a large quantity of gangrenous\r\n     lung tissue and foul pus.\r\n\r\n     At the _post-mortem_ examination a wound track was found\r\n     extending to the crest of the left ilium, where the bullet was\r\n     lodged. The patient was no doubt lying with his head dipped\r\n     into a hole scooped out in the sand (a common custom) when\r\n     struck; the bullet then traversed the muscles of the neck,\r\n     entered the upper opening of the thorax, where it struck the\r\n     bodies of the second and third dorsal vertebrae, one third of\r\n     the bodies of each of which were driven into an extensive\r\n     laceration of the lung; it then grooved the inner surfaces of\r\n     the eighth and ninth ribs, fractured the tenth and eleventh,\r\n     and passing the twelfth traversed the deep muscles of the back\r\n     to the pelvis. Beyond the injury to the occipital lobe, the\r\n     cerebellum was found to be lacerated and extensively bruised\r\n     and ecchymosed.\r\n\r\n_Complications._--_Hernia cerebri_ as a primary feature has already been\r\nmentioned as one of the peculiarities of some explosive wounds. In the\r\nlater stages of the cases in which primary union did not take place the\r\ndevelopment of granulation tumours was often seen, sometimes in\r\nconnection with slight local suppuration, sometimes over a cerebral\r\nabscess. In some cases a wound which had once closed reopened and a\r\nhernia developed. This sequence was chiefly of prognostic significance\r\nas an indication of intra-cranial inflammation, usually of a chronic\r\ncharacter, and affecting rather the lowly organised granulation tissue\r\nformed in the cavity than the brain itself. When primary union of the\r\nskin flap and wound failed, the process of definitive closure of the\r\nsubjacent cavity was always a very prolonged one, and it was in such\r\ncases that a great proportion of the so-called herniae developed.\r\n\r\n_Abscess of the brain._--Local abscesses formed in a considerable\r\nproportion of the cases where serious damage to the brain had occurred,\r\nin whatever region this happened to be. I never saw one develop in cases\r\nwhere primary union had taken place, even when bone fragments had not\r\nbeen removed; neither did I ever see an abscess situated at a distance\r\nfrom the original injury. I take it that the latter is to be explained\r\nby the early date of the suppuration, and the fact that in the great\r\nmajority of small-calibre wounds the exit opening exists in the\r\nsituation of the contre-coup damages of civil practice.\r\n\r\nThe main feature in the symptoms when abscesses developed was the\r\ninsidious mode of their appearance, usually at the end of fourteen to\r\ntwenty-one days, and their comparative mildness.\r\n\r\nVery slight evidences of compression were observed; thus, varying\r\ndegrees of headache, drowsiness, irritability of temper or depression,\r\ntwitchings, or in some cases Jacksonian seizures, combined with slow\r\npulse and slight rises of temperature. I never happened to see complete\r\nunconsciousness. The slight evidence of compression was perhaps\r\nexplained in most cases by the large bony defect in the skull, which\r\nacted as a kind of safety-valve. Again the firm nature of the\r\ncicatricial tissue which formed at the periphery of the injury and\r\nextended up to the skull and there formed a more or less firm\r\nattachment, also preserved the actual brain tissue to some degree from\r\neither pressure or direct irritation. After evacuation of the pus, the\r\nusual difficulty was experienced in ensuring free drainage, and\r\ndefinitive healing and closure of the cavities was very slow. The\r\nfollowing two cases will illustrate the character of the cases of\r\ncerebral abscess we met with:--\r\n\r\n     (70) _Fronto-parietal abscess._--Wounded at Magersfontein\r\n     (Mauser). _Entry_, 1-3/4 inch above the line from the lower\r\n     margin of the orbit to the external auditory meatus, and 1-3/4\r\n     inch behind the external angular process; _exit_, a little\r\n     posterior to the left parietal eminence. There was right\r\n     hemiplegia. The wounds were explored, and a large number of\r\n     fragments of bone and pulped brain were removed, especially\r\n     from the anterior wound. No great improvement followed, and the\r\n     patient was sent to the Base. At this time there was a large\r\n     hernia cerebri at the anterior wound which was suppurating.\r\n\r\n     A further operation was here performed (Mr. J. J. Day). The\r\n     hernia cerebri was removed, also several fragments of bone\r\n     which were found deeply imbedded in the brain. The patient then\r\n     improved, but a month later his temperature rose, and on\r\n     exploration an abscess was discovered in the frontal lobe and\r\n     drained.\r\n\r\n     Subsequently the patient suffered with Jacksonian seizures,\r\n     sometimes starting spontaneously, sometimes following\r\n     interference with the wound. The convulsions commenced in the\r\n     muscles of the face, and the twitchings then became general.\r\n     Meanwhile the right upper extremity remained weak, although the\r\n     fist could be clenched, and all movements of the limb made in\r\n     some degree.\r\n\r\n     Some difficulty was experienced in maintaining a free exit for\r\n     the pus, which was however overcome by the use of a silver\r\n     tube. All twitchings ceased about a month after the opening of\r\n     the abscess, the man improved steadily, and he left for England\r\n     fifteen weeks after the reception of the injury, walking well,\r\n     with a firm hand-grip, and the wounds soundly healed.\r\n\r\n     (71) _Frontal injury. Secondary abscess._--Wounded at Modder\r\n     River. Aperture of _entry_ (Mauser), just external to the\r\n     centre of the right eyebrow; _exit_, above the centre of the\r\n     right zygoma. The wound did not render the man immediately\r\n     unconscious, but he lost all recollection of what had happened\r\n     to him for the next three or four days. The wounds were\r\n     explored on the second day, at which time the patient was in a\r\n     semi-conscious drowsy state, the pupils contracted and the\r\n     pulse slow. A number of fragments of bone and pulped brain\r\n     matter were removed.\r\n\r\n     Subsequently to the operation the patient showed more signs of\r\n     cerebral irritation than usual, lying in a semi-conscious state\r\n     and more or less curled up. He answered questions on being\r\n     bothered. He improved somewhat, and was sent to the Base,\r\n     where the improvement continued, but he suffered much from\r\n     headache.\r\n\r\n     Later the headache became much more severe, and eleven weeks\r\n     after the injury the man complained of great pain both locally\r\n     and over the whole right hemisphere; he lay moaning, with the\r\n     temperature subnormal, and the pulse very slow. At times there\r\n     was nocturnal delirium.\r\n\r\n     The wound had remained closed and apparently normal, but now a\r\n     small fluctuating pulsating nipple-like swelling developed in\r\n     the situation of the aperture of entry. This was incised, and\r\n     two ounces of sweet pus evacuated (Professor Dunlop). A tube\r\n     was introduced, and removed later on the cessation of\r\n     discharge.\r\n\r\n     Removal of the tube was followed by a recurrence of the same\r\n     symptoms, and this occurred on no fewer than six occasions\r\n     whenever the wound closed.\r\n\r\n     At the end of twenty weeks the patient appeared quite well, the\r\n     wound had been closed six weeks, the previously irritable\r\n     mental state was replaced by placidity, and he was sent home.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The importance of proper exploration of scalp wounds to\r\ndetermine the condition of the bone has already been insisted upon. The\r\nlocalisation of the position and extent of the injury to the cranial\r\ncontents depended simply on attention to the symptoms, and needs no\r\nfurther mention here.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--This subject can only be very imperfectly considered at\r\nthe present time, since only the more or less immediate results of the\r\ninjuries are known to us, while the more important after consequences\r\nremain to be followed up.\r\n\r\nAs to life the immediate prognosis has been already foreshadowed in the\r\nsection on the anatomical lesions. It is there shown that the first\r\npoint of general importance is the range of fire at which the injury has\r\nbeen received. At short ranges, as evidenced by the history, the\r\ncharacters of the wounds, and the severity of the symptoms, the\r\nimmediate prognosis was uniformly bad, a very great majority of the\r\npatients dying, and that at the end of a few hours or days.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which death followed depended in part on the actual\r\nseverity of the wound, and still more on the region it affected; the\r\nnearer the base and the longer the track the more rapidly the patients\r\ndied, and this always with signs of failure of the functions of the\r\nheart and lungs due to general concussion, pressure from basal\r\nhaemorrhage, or rapid intracranial oedema. In my experience no patients\r\nsurvived direct fracture of the base in any region but the frontal,\r\nalthough many, no doubt, got well in whom fissures merely spread into\r\nthe middle or posterior fossa. Patients with very extensive injuries at\r\na higher level, on the other hand, often survived days, or even a week,\r\nthen usually dying of sepsis.\r\n\r\nThe actual relative mortality of these injuries I can give little idea\r\nof, but it was a high one both on the field and in the Field hospitals;\r\nthus of 10 cases treated in one Field hospital, after the battle at\r\nPaardeberg Drift, no less than 8 died; while of 61 cases from various\r\nbattles who survived to be sent down to the Base during a period of some\r\nmonths, only 4 or 6.55 per cent. died. Many of the latter, as is seen\r\nfrom the cases here recorded which were among the number, were none the\r\nless of a very serious nature. The early causes of death in patients\r\ndying during the first forty-eight hours have been already mentioned;\r\nthe later one was almost always sepsis.\r\n\r\nAs in civil practice the best immediate results were seen in injuries to\r\nthe frontal lobes, and after these in injuries to the occipital region.\r\nIn the latter permanent lesions of vision were, however, common. The\r\nabove injuries apart, the prognosis depended on the severity and depth\r\nof the lesion. The frequency and extent of radiation symptoms often made\r\nit possible to give a more hopeful prognosis than the immediate\r\nconditions seemed to warrant, if the exact situation of the lesion, and\r\nthe probable velocity at which the bullet was travelling, were taken\r\ninto account; since the actual destructive lesion, when the velocity had\r\nbeen insufficient to cause damage of a general nature, was often very\r\nstrictly localised.\r\n\r\nAnother very important point in the immediate prognosis was the primary\r\nunion of the scalp wound; if this could only be ensured, few cases went\r\nwrong afterwards. Such remote effects as I witnessed were mainly the\r\nresults of the actual destructive lesion, such as paralyses and\r\ncontraction. I know of only one case in which early maniacal symptoms\r\nclosely followed on a frontal injury, and here the symptoms accompanied\r\nthe development of an abscess. Some patients were depressed and\r\nirritable, and some were blind or deaf, probably from gross lesion; in\r\none patient the mental faculties generally were lowered.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the surprising immediate recoveries which occurred, and the\r\nsmall amount of experience I am able to record as to remote ill effects\r\nof these injuries, I feel certain that a long roll of secondary troubles\r\nfrom the contraction of cicatricial tissue, irritation from distant\r\nremaining bone fragments, as well as mental troubles from actual brain\r\ndestruction, await record in the near future.\r\n\r\nSince my return to England I have heard of four cases of injury to the\r\nhead, which died on their return, as the result of the formation of\r\nsecondary residual abscesses; and of one who died suddenly, soon after\r\nhis return to active service in South Africa apparently well. These\r\noccurrences are sufficiently suggestive.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to add here two cases of secondary traumatic\r\nepilepsy of differing degree:--\r\n\r\n     (72) _Gutter fracture over left temporo-sphenoidal lobe.\r\n     Traumatic epilepsy._--A trooper in Brabant's Horse was wounded\r\n     at Aliwal North, in March, in several places. A Mauser bullet\r\n     entered the head 1-1/2 inch above the junction of the anterior\r\n     border of the left pinna with the side of the head. The exit\r\n     wound was situated just below and behind the left parietal\r\n     eminence. The patient stated that the shot was fired by a man\r\n     he recognised in a laager 150 yards distant from him.\r\n\r\n     The man remained unconscious eleven days, and when he came\r\n     round paralysis of the right upper extremity, and weakness of\r\n     both lower extremities, were noted. There was also ataxic\r\n     aphasia.\r\n\r\n     The wounds healed, but two months later the man began to suffer\r\n     from fits every few days. He spoke of them as fainting fits,\r\n     but they were accompanied by general twitchings.\r\n\r\n     The patient was shown to me in July by Major Woodhouse,\r\n     R.A.M.C. The strength of the right upper extremity was then\r\n     good, and he walked well. Speech was slow, but correct. The\r\n     pupils were equal, and acted normally.\r\n\r\n     The mental condition was weak, and the temper irritable. The\r\n     man had hallucinations, and was very obstinate: there was\r\n     complete deafness of the left ear. He refused surgical\r\n     treatment, but was really hardly a responsible individual.\r\n\r\n     (73) _Gutter fracture in right frontal region. Traumatic\r\n     epilepsy._--Wounded at Pieter's Hill. Gutter fracture crossing\r\n     the outer aspect of the frontal lobe, immediately above the\r\n     level of the right Sylvian fissure. The wound was perforating\r\n     at the central part, but only reached as far back as the lower\r\n     end of the ascending frontal convolution. The patient was\r\n     rendered unconscious and was removed to Mooi River. He was\r\n     there seen by Sir William MacCormac, who removed a number of\r\n     fragments of bone. The patient rapidly recovered consciousness\r\n     after the operation, but was completely hemiplegic. After a\r\n     month he suddenly found he was able to move his lower\r\n     extremity, and later the paralysis became steadily less.\r\n\r\n     On his return home the man obtained employment as a\r\n     Commissionaire, but nine months after the injury, while his\r\n     wife was helping him on with his coat one morning, he was\r\n     suddenly seized with a fit; the paralysed arm was jerked up,\r\n     and convulsions became general, a wedge needing to be inserted\r\n     to prevent the tongue suffering injury.\r\n\r\n     When admitted into the hospital, the cicatrix of the wound was\r\n     considerably depressed, and the central part was evidently\r\n     continuously attached to the surface of the brain. Pulsation\r\n     was both visible and palpable, there was little or no\r\n     tenderness on examination, and the patient did not complain of\r\n     pain.\r\n\r\n     Little trace of the left facial paralysis remained. The man\r\n     walked well, but with foot-drop. The left upper extremity was\r\n     rigid, but chiefly from the elbow downwards. The fingers were\r\n     flexed, but a slight increase of grip could be effected. No\r\n     other active movements of hand. The elbow was held flexed, but\r\n     could be straightened to about 3/4 range on effort. The\r\n     shoulder could be slightly abducted, but wide movements were\r\n     made by the scapular muscles.\r\n\r\n     Sensation was dull over the left side of the face, also over\r\n     the left side of the neck. There was complete loss of cutaneous\r\n     sensibility over the lower half of the forearm and hand, and a\r\n     similar patch in the left axilla. Over the rest of the\r\n     extremity the sensation was better on the flexor than on the\r\n     extensor aspects. There was little alteration in the common\r\n     sensation elsewhere, except that the contrast between that of\r\n     the dorsum and sole of the foot was somewhat more marked than\r\n     usual. The temperature of the insensitive axilla was one degree\r\n     higher than that of the right.\r\n\r\n     The left knee jerk was somewhat exaggerated.\r\n\r\n     On December 15 an incision was made through the old cicatrix\r\n     directly over the defect in the skull. On separating the skin\r\n     it was found directly adherent to the cicatrised dura, and when\r\n     this was incised a large vicarious arachnoid space was opened\r\n     up. The space was crossed by a number of strands of connective\r\n     tissue, and the cavity had no epithelial lining. The fluid ran\r\n     out freely, and the space was evidently in free communication\r\n     with the general arachnoid cavity. A trephine crown was taken\r\n     out at the posterior end of the gutter, and the surface of the\r\n     brain explored, but no fragments of bone were found. I\r\n     therefore replaced the crown, and closed the bony defect in the\r\n     floor of the gutter with a plate of platinum fitted into a\r\n     groove made in the bony margin. The wound was then sutured.\r\n     Primary union took place, and there was no constitutional\r\n     disturbance beyond one temperature of 100 deg. on the evening of\r\n     the second day; otherwise the temperature remained normal, and\r\n     the pulse did not rise above 75.\r\n\r\n     On the second evening a fit occurred, coming on while the\r\n     patient was apparently asleep. It lasted about a quarter of an\r\n     hour and was general, the patient becoming for a short time\r\n     unconscious, and passing water involuntarily.\r\n\r\n     On the third morning two similar fits occurred, the first a\r\n     severe one, during which the patient passed a motion\r\n     involuntarily. The commencement of all three fits was observed\r\n     by the nurse only, but in each the convulsions apparently\r\n     commenced in the face and then became general.\r\n\r\n     Three months later no further fits had occurred, and the\r\n     patient, who throughout had said he felt remarkably well,\r\n     complained of nothing. The upper extremity was apparently\r\n     slightly less rigid than before the exploration, and the\r\n     patient said he walked somewhat better than before. The closure\r\n     of the skull was perfect.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of fractures of the skull possesses a degree\r\nof surgical interest that attaches to no other class of gunshot injury,\r\nsince operative interference is necessary in every case in which\r\nrecovery is judged possible. The injuries are, without exception, of the\r\nnature of punctured wounds of the skull, and the ordinary rule of\r\nsurgery should under no circumstances be deviated from. An expectant\r\nattitude, although it often appears immediately satisfactory, exposes\r\nthe patient to future risks which are incalculable, but none the less\r\nserious. Happily the operations needed may be included amongst the most\r\nsimple as well as the most successful, and expose the patient with\r\nordinary precautions to no increase of risk beyond that dependent on the\r\noriginal injury.\r\n\r\nCases of a general character, or in which the base has been directly\r\nfractured other than in the frontal region, are seldom suitable for\r\noperation, since surgical skill is in these of no avail; but in all\r\nothers an exploration is indicated. I use the word 'exploration'\r\nadvisedly, since what may be called the formal operation of trephining\r\nis seldom necessary except in the case of the small openings due to\r\nwounds received from a very long range of fire; in all others there is\r\nno difficulty, but very great advantage, in making such enlargement of\r\nthe bone opening as is necessary with Hoffman's forceps.\r\n\r\nThe scalp should be first shaved and cleansed; if for any reason an\r\noperation is impossible, this procedure at least should be carried out,\r\nwith a view to ensuring, as far as possible, future asepsis, infection\r\nin head injuries being almost the only danger to be feared. The shaving\r\nmay need to be complete, but local clearance of the hair suffices in\r\nmany cases. The hair having been removed, the scalp is cleansed with all\r\ncare, a flap is raised of which the bullet opening forms the central\r\npoint, and the wound explored. In slight cases the entry opening is the\r\none of chief importance, and the exit may be simply cleansed and\r\ndressed. In some instances, as in direct fracture of the roof of the\r\norbit from above, the exit should not be touched.\r\n\r\nThe flap having been raised, if the wound be a small perforation, a\r\n1/2-inch trephine crown may be taken from one side; but it is rare for\r\nthe opening to be so small that the tip of a pair of Hoffman's forceps\r\ncannot be inserted. The trephine is more often useful in cases of\r\nnon-penetrating gutter fractures where space is needed for exploration,\r\nand the elevation or removal of fragments of the inner-table. Loose\r\nfragments may need to be removed from beneath the scalp, but the\r\nimportant ones are those within the cranium. These may either be of some\r\nsize, or fine comminuted splinters of either table, often at as great a\r\ndistance as 2 inches or more from the surface. The cavity must be\r\nthoroughly explored and all splinters removed. I have seen more than\r\nfifty extracted in one case of open gutter fracture. The brain pulp and\r\nclot should then be gently removed or washed away, and the wound closed\r\nwithout drainage. Fragments of bone, as a rule, are better not replaced,\r\nbut complete suture of the skin flap is always advisable in view of the\r\ngreat importance of primary union, and the fact that a drainage opening\r\nexists at the original wound of entry, and that the wound is readily\r\nre-opened to its whole extent, should such a step be advisable.\r\n\r\nThe detection of fragments is easiest and most satisfactorily done with\r\nthe finger, and in all but simple punctures the opening should be large\r\nenough to allow thoroughly effective digital exploration; the remarks\r\nalready made as to the factors determining the size of fragments are of\r\ninterest in this connection. The determination of the amount of brain\r\npulp which should be removed is somewhat more difficult; one can only\r\nsay that all that washes readily away should be removed, and its place\r\nis usually taken up by blood.\r\n\r\nFew fractures of the base are suitable for treatment; the only ones I\r\nsaw were those of direct fracture of the roof of the orbit or nose,\r\nproduced by bullets passing across the orbits; here the advisability of\r\ninterference with the injured eye led to opening of the orbit, and\r\nsometimes exposed the fracture. Some patients recovered, even when the\r\ndamage had been sufficient to cause escape of pulped brain into the\r\norbit.\r\n\r\nThe after treatment simply consisted in keeping the patients as quiet as\r\ncircumstances would permit, and the administration of a fluid diet. In\r\nsome cases recurring symptoms pointed to the continued presence of bone\r\nfragments; these were usually indicated by signs of irritation, or often\r\nof local inflammation, in the latter case infection taking the greater\r\nshare in the causation. Such cases needed secondary exploration, and the\r\nwonderful success of this operation, even when the wound was evidently\r\ninfected, was perhaps one of the most striking experiences of the\r\nsurgery in general.\r\n\r\nI should add a word here as to the most satisfactory time for the\r\nperformance of these operations; as in all cases the earlier they could\r\nbe undertaken the better, but in the head injuries the advantages of\r\nearly interference were more evident than in any other region. This\r\ndepended on the fact that, as in civil practice, the scalp is one of the\r\nmost dangerous regions as far as auto-infection of the wound is\r\nconcerned, and one of the most difficult to cleanse, except by thorough\r\nshaving. Beyond this the extreme simplicity of the operative procedure\r\nneeded, called for few precautions beyond those for asepsis, and very\r\nlittle armament in the way of instruments, &c.\r\n\r\nWhen on the march from Winberg to Heilbron with the Highland Brigade we\r\nhad some five days' continuous fighting, and on this occasion several\r\nperforating fractures of the skull were brought in. The coldness of the\r\nnights at that time made evening operations an impossibility; hence the\r\noperations on these men were performed at the first dressing station, in\r\nthe open air, at the side of the ambulance wagons, often during the\r\nprogress of fighting around. Of several cases so operated on, all healed\r\nby primary union without a bad symptom of any kind, except one (see p.\r\n249), in whom a very large entrance opening over the right cortical\r\nmotor area led down to an extensive destruction of the brain,\r\ncomplicated by a fracture of the base in the middle fossa. This wound,\r\nfrom the first considered hopeless, became septic during the four days'\r\ntravelling in an ambulance wagon that was necessary, and the man died at\r\nthe end of fourteen days. As the whole cortical motor area was\r\ndestroyed, death was, perhaps, the end most to be desired; but the fight\r\nthat this man made for recovery, and the fact that his death, after all,\r\nwas due to general infection and not to any local extension of the\r\ninjury, very strongly impressed me with the possibility of recovery,\r\neven in such extensive cases, if only an aseptic condition can be\r\nmaintained. I saw many other cases of the same nature, particularly in\r\nmen who, as a result of unfortunate circumstances, were necessarily left\r\nout on the field for more than twenty-four hours. In some of these\r\nmaggots were found in the wounds only thirty-six hours after the\r\ninfliction of the injury.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing as to the treatment of the large primary herniae\r\ncerebri in wounds of an explosive nature, since these were rarely\r\nsubjects suitable for operation; but in the instances of minor severity\r\nthey were treated as the other cases where the pulped brain lay mostly\r\nwithin the skull.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the wounds were in the frontal or fronto-parietal\r\nregions, and hemiplegia existed, the rapid improvement in the paralytic\r\nsymptoms, after operation, was very marked, showing that the signs were\r\nmainly, or entirely, due to 'radiation' injury. I am inclined to think\r\nthat temporary injury of this kind from vibratory disturbance and small\r\nparenchymatous haemorrhages, were far more often the cause of the\r\nparalysis than surface haemorrhage, since the latter was rarely found in\r\nlarge quantity. Large clots, however, no doubt growing in both size and\r\nfirmness, occasionally occupied the area of destroyed brain, and these\r\nsometimes manifestly exercised pressure that was at once relieved by\r\ntheir evacuation.\r\n\r\nIn cases where inflammatory hernia cerebri developed, a secondary\r\nexploration was often indicated for the removal of fragments of bone or\r\nthe evacuation of pus, otherwise the condition was best treated by dry\r\ndressings and gentle support.\r\n\r\nAbscess of the brain was treated by simple evacuation and drainage by\r\nmetal or rubber tubes: the operations were always of extreme simplicity,\r\nsince the abscess in every case I saw was in the direct line of the\r\nwound track, and was readily opened by the insertion of a director or\r\nblunt knife. The only trouble in the after treatment was that already\r\nreferred to, of preventing premature closure of the drainage opening.\r\n\r\nI have made no special reference to the method of dressing, since it was\r\nof the ordinary routine kind. The most important factor in success was\r\nthe efficient primary disinfection of the scalp; a piece of antiseptic\r\ngauze and some absorbent wool, efficiently secured, was all that was\r\nneeded later.\r\n\r\nAs usual the consideration of the treatment of cases in which the bullet\r\nwas retained may be considered last. Such accidents were distinctly\r\nrare. I operated in only one (No. 54, p. 260) in whom the indications\r\nboth for localisation and interference were obvious, since the bullet\r\nhad palpably fractured the bone, although it had not retained sufficient\r\nforce to enable it to leave the skull. In two other cases that I saw, in\r\none the bullet was lodged in the zygomatic fossa, in the second just\r\nbelow the mastoid process. The former patient died; the latter exhibited\r\nsymptoms indicative of injury to the occipital lobe (No. 68), and was\r\nsuccessfully treated by Mr. J. E. Ker. I never happened to see a case in\r\nwhich a retained bullet in the skull was localised by the X rays, but\r\nsuch might have been possible in case No. 64, p. 275. In no case is\r\nprimary interference indicated, unless a fracture exists where the\r\nbullet has tried to escape, or secondary symptoms develop pointing to\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances, moreover, the indications for removal of a\r\nbullet are not likely to be sufficiently imperative to necessitate the\r\noperation being undertaken until the patient can be placed under the\r\nbest conditions that can be secured. This is the more advisable since\r\nsuch operations need the infliction of an additional wound, require\r\ngreat delicacy, and may be very prolonged in performance. The experience\r\nof civil practice has already sufficiently proved the small amount of\r\ninconvenience likely to follow the retention of a bullet in the skull.\r\n\r\nI may again mention the fact that in explorations for the removal of\r\nbone fragments, fragments of lead, from breaking or setting up of the\r\nbullet, are sometimes found.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the operations on the head were extremely satisfactory\r\nfrom a technical point of view; the large depressed pulsating cicatrix\r\nso often left was the chief defect observed. The circumstances under\r\nwhich many of the operations had to be performed militated strongly,\r\nhowever, against the successful replacement of separated bone fragments,\r\nwhich might have rendered the defects less serious.\r\n\r\nSecondary operations for traumatic epilepsy scarcely come within the\r\nscope of these experiences. In case 73, p. 292, it is of interest to\r\nnote the manner in which the cavity due to loss of brain substance was\r\nfilled up. No doubt a similar vicarious arachnoid space develops in all\r\ncases in which a soft pulsating swelling fills an aperture in the bones\r\nof the skull.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE HEAD NOT INVOLVING THE BRAIN\r\n\r\n_Mastoid process._--The most important wound of the cranium not already\r\nmentioned was that involving the mastoid process and the bony capsule of\r\nthe ear. Wounds of the mastoid process obtained their chief interest in\r\nconnection with paralysis of the seventh nerve. This nerve rarely or\r\nnever escaped, and, as far as my experience went, the facial paralysis\r\nwas permanent (see cases 111-114, p. 355). I think the same prognosis\r\nholds good with regard to the deafness resulting from these injuries,\r\nand it is difficult to believe, with our experience of the effect of\r\nvibration on other nerve centres and organs, that the internal ear could\r\never escape permanent damage.\r\n\r\nIn a number of cases the tympanum itself, or the external auditory\r\nmeatus, was directly implicated in tracks; in these, also, loss of\r\nhearing was the rule.\r\n\r\nWounds of the pinna when produced by undeformed bullets were usually of\r\nthe same slitlike nature remarked in perforations of the cartilages of\r\nthe nose, and healed with equal rapidity.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the orbit._--Injuries to the orbit were very numerous and\r\nserious in their results, both to the globe of the eye and the\r\nsurrounding structures.\r\n\r\n_Anatomical lesions._--The wound tracks, with regard to the injuries\r\nproduced, may be well classified according to the direction they took;\r\nthus--vertical, transverse, and oblique.\r\n\r\nVertical wound tracks were on the whole the least serious, but this\r\nmainly from the fact of limitation of the injury to one orbital cavity.\r\nThey were usually produced by bullets passing from above downwards\r\nthrough the frontal region of the cranium, and were received by the\r\npatients while in the prone position.\r\n\r\nTransverse and oblique wounds owed their greater importance to the fact\r\nthat both eyes were more likely to be implicated.\r\n\r\nBesides these tracks, which actually crossed the cavities, a number\r\ninvolved the bony boundaries, producing almost as severe lesions in the\r\nglobe of the eye, many of the patients being rendered permanently blind.\r\nThe only difference in nature of such cases was the escape of orbital\r\nstructures, and this was of minor importance in the presence of the\r\ngraver lesion to vision. The following is an illustrative case:--\r\n\r\n     (74) Wounded at Colenso. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1 inch below the\r\n     centre of the margin of the right orbit; _exit_, behind the\r\n     right angle of the mandible. Fracture of lower jaw, and\r\n     development of a diffuse traumatic aneurism of the external\r\n     carotid artery. The common carotid artery was tied for\r\n     secondary haemorrhage (Mr. Jameson) some three weeks later.\r\n\r\n     Vision was affected at the time of the accident; the fingers\r\n     could be seen, but not counted. After ligation of the carotid\r\n     the condition was possibly worse, and this needs mention as\r\n     transitory loss of power in the left upper extremity also\r\n     followed the operation.\r\n\r\nFractures of the bony wall were of every degree. The most severe that I\r\nsaw were two in which lateral impact by a bullet crossing the cranial\r\ncavity caused general comminution of the whole orbital roof. Fissures of\r\nthe roof were common in connection with 'explosive' exit apertures in\r\nthe frontal region of the skull. Pure perforations usually accompanied\r\nthe vertical or transverse wounds of the cavity, fragments at the\r\naperture of entry then being projected into the orbit, sometimes\r\npenetrating the muscles.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the margin of the cavity was merely notched.\r\n\r\nThe ocular muscles were often divided more or less completely, and\r\noccasionally some difficulty arose in determining whether loss of\r\nmovement of the globe in any definite direction depended on injury to\r\nthe muscle itself, or to the nerve supplying the muscle. The following\r\ncase illustrates this point:--\r\n\r\n     (75) _Entry_ (Mauser), 2 inches behind the right external\r\n     canthus; the bullet pierced the external wall and traversed the\r\n     floor of the right orbit beneath the globe, crossed the nasal\r\n     cavity, and a part of the left orbit; _exit_, at the lower\r\n     margin of the left orbit, beneath the centre of the globe of\r\n     the eye.\r\n\r\n     Complete loss of sight followed the injury, and persisted for\r\n     one week. Modified vision then returned.\r\n\r\n     Three weeks later there was diplopia; loss of function of the\r\n     right external and inferior recti, although the ball could be\r\n     turned downward to some extent by the superior oblique when the\r\n     internal rectus was in action. Movements of the left globe were\r\n     not seriously affected.\r\n\r\n     The pupils were immobile and moderately dilated, but atropine\r\n     had been employed two days previously.\r\n\r\n     A year later the condition was as follows: There is some\r\n     weakness of the right seventh nerve, as evidenced by want of\r\n     symmetry in all the folds of the face, and in narrowing of the\r\n     palpebral fissure.\r\n\r\n     When at rest the right eye is somewhat raised and turned\r\n     outwards. Active movements outwards or downwards are\r\n     restricted. There is diplopia, and the vision of the right eye\r\n     is much impaired; the man can see persons, but cannot count\r\n     fingers with certainty, although he sees the hand. Putting on\r\n     one side the loss of free movement, there is no obvious\r\n     external appearance of injury to the eye.\r\n\r\nMr. J. H. Fisher reported as follows:\r\n\r\n     Ophthalmoscopic examination shows the left eye and fundus to be\r\n     normal. The right disc is not atrophied, but the whole of the\r\n     lower half of the fundus is coated with masses of black retinal\r\n     pigment. There is atrophy in spots of the capillary layer of\r\n     the choroid, and the larger vessels of the deeper layer are\r\n     exposed between the interstices of the pigment masses. There is\r\n     no definite choroidal rupture. The lesion encroaches upon and\r\n     implicates the macular region.\r\n\r\n     The injury is a concussion one, not necessarily resulting from\r\n     contact, and certainly not due to a perforation. The loss of\r\n     movement and faulty position are the result of injury to the\r\n     muscles, and not to nerve implication.\r\n\r\n     The man complained that when he blew his nose the left eye\r\n     filled with water and air came out. The left nasal duct was\r\n     however shown to be intact, as water injected by the\r\n     canaliculus passed freely into the nose.\r\n\r\nIntra-orbital bleeding, subconjunctival haemorrhage with proptosis and\r\necchymosis of the lids were usually well marked. The latter was\r\nsometimes extreme.\r\n\r\nInjury to the nerves was naturally of a very mixed character. In many\r\ninstances the branches of the first two divisions of the fifth nerve\r\nwere obviously implicated and regional anaesthesia was common. This was\r\noften transitory when the result of vibratory concussion, contusion, or\r\npressure from haemorrhage. In other cases it was more prolonged as a\r\nresult of actual division of the nerve. As is usually the case, when a\r\nsmall area of distribution only was affected, sensation was rapidly\r\nregained from vicarious sources, even when section had been complete.\r\n\r\nAs individual injuries, those to the optic nerve were the most\r\nfrequently diagnosed. I am sorry to be unable to attempt a\r\ndiscrimination of injuries to the nerve alone from those in which both\r\nnerve and globe suffered, but the globe can rarely have escaped injury,\r\neither direct or indirect, when the bullet actually traversed the\r\norbital cavity. (A few further remarks concerning injuries to the optic\r\nnerve will be found in Chapter IX.)\r\n\r\nInjuries to the globe of the eye, either direct or indirect, accompanied\r\nmost of the orbital wounds.\r\n\r\nIn some the lesion was of the nature of concussion. In such the bone\r\ninjury was usually at the periphery of the orbit, or to the bones of the\r\nface in the neighbourhood. The loss of vision might then be temporary,\r\npersisting from two to ten days, then returning, often with some\r\ndeficiencies.\r\n\r\nIn other similar external injuries, the lesion of the globe was more\r\nsevere, and permanent blindness followed.\r\n\r\nIn variability of degree of completeness, these lesions of the globe\r\ncorresponded exactly with those produced in other parts of the nervous\r\nsystem by bullets striking the bones in their vicinity, and they were no\r\ndoubt the result of a similar transmission of vibratory force.\r\n\r\nIn a third series of cases the globe suffered direct contusion, and in a\r\nfourth was perforated and destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which permanent blindness was produced without solution of\r\ncontinuity of the sclerotic coat, the nature of the lesion was probably\r\nin most cases vibratory concussion and the development of multiple\r\nhaemorrhages from choroidal ruptures of a similar nature to those seen in\r\nthe brain and spinal cord. The actual haemorrhagic areae varied in size;\r\nbut, as far as my experience went, gross haemorrhages into the anterior\r\nchamber did not occur without severe direct contact of the bullet.\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of the cases blindness, whether transitory or\r\npermanent, developed immediately on the reception of the injury, and was\r\npossibly in its initial stage the result of primary concussion.\r\n\r\nCases were, however, seen occasionally in which the symptoms were less\r\nsudden, of which the following is an example. I did not think that the\r\nmode of progress seen here could be referred to simple orbital\r\nhaemorrhage, although this existed, but rather to intravaginal haemorrhage\r\ninto the sheath of the optic nerve. On external inspection the globes\r\nappeared normal.\r\n\r\n     (76) Wounded at Paardeberg. _Entry_ (Mauser), over the centre\r\n     of the right zygoma; the bullet traversed the right orbit,\r\n     nose, and left orbit. _Exit_, immediately above the outer\r\n     extremity of the left eyebrow.\r\n\r\n     The patient stated that he could 'see' for thirty minutes with\r\n     the right eye and for an hour with the left, immediately after\r\n     the injury. He then became totally blind, and has since\r\n     remained so. During the next three weeks there were occasional\r\n     'flashes of light' experienced, but these then ceased.\r\n\r\n     At the end of three weeks the condition was as follows: Ocular\r\n     movements good in every direction except that of elevation of\r\n     the globe. The levator palpebrae superioris acted very slightly;\r\n     the right, however, better than the left.\r\n\r\n     There were marked right proptosis, less left proptosis, and\r\n     slight patchy subconjunctival haemorrhage of both eyes. The\r\n     pupils were dilated, motionless, and not concentric.\r\n\r\n     The patient was invalided as totally blind (November, 1900).\r\n\r\nMr. Lang, who saw this patient on his return to England, kindly\r\nfurnishes me with the following note as to the condition. There was\r\nextensive damage to both eyes, haemorrhage, and probably retinal\r\ndetachment as well as choroidal changes.\r\n\r\nThe quotation of a few illustrative examples typical of the ordinary\r\norbital injuries may be of interest:--\r\n\r\n     (77) _Vertical wound._--_Entry_, into left orbit in roof\r\n     posterior to globe, and internal to optic nerve; _exit_, from\r\n     orbit through junction of inner wall and floor into nose.\r\n\r\n     Complete blindness followed the injury, but upon the second day\r\n     light was perceived on lifting the upper lid. There was marked\r\n     proptosis, subconjunctival ecchymosis, swelling and ecchymosis\r\n     of the upper lid, and ptosis. Anaesthesia in the whole area of\r\n     distribution of the frontal nerve.\r\n\r\n     At the end of three weeks, fingers could be recognised, but a\r\n     large blind spot existed in the centre of the field of vision.\r\n     The general movements of the globe were fair, but the upper lid\r\n     could not be raised. The proptosis and subconjunctival\r\n     haemorrhage cleared up.\r\n\r\n     Little further improvement occurred; six months later the\r\n     patient could only count the fingers excentrically. A very\r\n     extensive scotoma was present. The optic disc was much\r\n     atrophied, the calibre of the arteries diminished and the veins\r\n     full (Mr. Critchett). The ptosis persisted. It was doubtful in\r\n     this case whether the ptosis depended on injury to the nerve of\r\n     supply, or on laceration and fixation of the levator palpebrae\r\n     superioris. The latter seemed the more probable, as the\r\n     superior rectus acted. The absence of any sign of gross\r\n     bleeding into the anterior chamber is opposed to the existence\r\n     of a perforating lesion of the globe in this case.\r\n\r\n     (78) _Entry_ (Mauser), from cranial cavity, just within the\r\n     centre of the roof of the right orbit; _exit_, from the orbit\r\n     by a notch in the lower orbital margin internal to the\r\n     infra-orbital foramen; track thence beneath the soft parts of\r\n     the face to emerge from the margin of the upper lip near the\r\n     left angle of the mouth. Collapse of globe, proptosis,\r\n     subconjunctival haemorrhage, oedema and ecchymosis of lids.\r\n\r\n     Shrunken ball removed on twenty-fourth day (Major Burton,\r\n     R.A.M.C.).\r\n\r\n     (79) _Entry_ (Mauser), at the posterior border of the left\r\n     mastoid process, 3/4 inch above the tip; _exit_, in the inner\r\n     third of the left upper eyelid. Globe excised at end of seven\r\n     days. Facial paralysis and deafness.\r\n\r\n     (80) _Entry_ (Mauser), from cranial cavity through centre of\r\n     roof of orbit; _exit_, through maxillary antrum. Total\r\n     blindness. Movements of ball good, no loss of tension.\r\n     Proptosis, subconjunctival haemorrhage, ecchymosis of eyelids.\r\n     No improvement in sight followed. One month later the globe\r\n     suppurated and was removed. The bullet had divided the optic\r\n     nerve and contused the ball.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis and treatment of wounds of the orbit._--Except in those cases\r\nin which return of vision was rapid, the prognosis was consistently bad\r\nin the injuries to the globe. When the globe was ruptured it, as a rule,\r\nrapidly shrank. The case (80) quoted above is the only one in which I\r\nsaw secondary suppuration.\r\n\r\nWith regard to active treatment, the majority of the cases were\r\ncomplicated by fracture of the roof of the orbit, and in many instances\r\nconcurrent brain injury was present. In all of these, as a general rule,\r\nit was advisable to await the closure of the wound in the orbital roof\r\nprior to removal of the injured eye, if that was considered necessary.\r\nThe only exception to this rule was offered by instances in which the\r\nbullet passed from the orbit into the cranium; in these primary removal\r\nof fragments projecting into the frontal lobe was preferable. As already\r\nindicated, such wounds were comparatively rare except in the case of\r\nbullets coursing transversely or obliquely.\r\n\r\nThe wounds were, as a rule, followed by considerable matting of the\r\norbital structures.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the nose._--I will pass by the external parts, with the\r\nremark that perforating wounds of the cartilages were remarkable for\r\ntheir sharp limitation and simple nature. I remember one case shown to\r\nme in the Irish Hospital in Bloemfontein by Sir W. Thomson, in which at\r\nthe end of the third day small symmetrical vertical slits in each ala\r\nalready healed were scarcely visible. This case very strongly impressed\r\none with the doctrine of chances, since on the same morning I was asked\r\nto see a patient in whom a similar transverse shot had crossed both\r\norbits, destroying both globes and injuring the brain.\r\n\r\nA retained bullet in the upper portion of the nasal cavity has already\r\nbeen referred to (fig. 60). This accident was naturally a rare one; in\r\nthat instance the bullet had only retained sufficient force to insert\r\nitself neatly between the bones.\r\n\r\nWounds crossing the nasal fossae were comparatively common. The\r\ninterference with the sense of smell often resulting is discussed in\r\nChapter IX.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the malar bone_ were not infrequent. The small amount of\r\nsplintering was somewhat remarkable considering the density of structure\r\nof the bone. In this particular the behaviour of the malar corresponded\r\nwith what was observed in the flat bones in general. A case quoted in\r\nChapter III. p. 87, illustrates the capacity of the hard edge of the\r\nbone to check the course of a bullet, and cause considerable deformity\r\nand fissuring of the mantle.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the jaws. Upper jaw._--A large number of tracks crossing the\r\nantrum transversely, obliquely, or vertically were observed. In the\r\nfirst case the nasal cavity, in the others the orbital or buccal cavity,\r\nwere generally concurrently involved. It was somewhat striking that I\r\nnever observed any trouble, immediate or remote, from these perforations\r\nof the antrum. If haemorrhage into the cavity occurred, it gave rise to\r\nno ultimate trouble. I never saw an instance of secondary suppuration\r\neven in cases where the bullet entered or escaped through the alveolar\r\nprocess with considerable local comminution. The branches of the second\r\ndivision of the fifth nerve were sometimes implicated. In one instance a\r\nbullet traversed and cut away a longitudinal groove in the bones,\r\nextending from the posterior margin of the hard palate, and terminating\r\nby a wide notch in the alveolar process.\r\n\r\nA good example of a troublesome transverse wound of the bones of the\r\nface is afforded by the following instance:--\r\n\r\n     (81) _Entry_ (Mauser), through the left malar eminence, 1 inch\r\n     below and external to the external canthus; _exit_, a slightly\r\n     curved tranverse slit in the lobe of the right ear.\r\n\r\n     The injury was followed by no signs of orbital concussion, and\r\n     no loss of consciousness. There was free bleeding from both\r\n     external wounds and from the nose. The sense of smell was\r\n     unaffected, but taste was impaired, and there was loss of\r\n     tactile sensation in the teeth on the left side also on the\r\n     hard palate. There was no evidence of fracture of the neck of\r\n     the mandible, nor of the external auditory meatus, but there\r\n     was considerable difficulty in opening the mouth widely or\r\n     protruding the teeth. The latter difficulty persisted for some\r\n     time, and was still present when I last saw the patient.\r\n\r\n_Mandible._--Fractures of the lower jaw were frequent and offered some\r\npeculiarities, the chief of which were the liability of any part of the\r\nbone to be damaged, and the absence of the obliquity between the cleft\r\nin the outer and inner tables so common in the fractures seen in civil\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe neck of the condyle I three times saw fractured; in each instance\r\npermanent stiffness and inability to open the mouth resulted. This\r\nstiffness was of a degree sufficient to raise the question whether the\r\nbest course in such cases would not be to cut down primarily and remove\r\na considerable number of loose fragments, and thus diminish the amount\r\nof callus likely to be thrown out.\r\n\r\nFractures of the ascending ramus and body were more frequent. They were\r\naccompanied by considerable comminution, but all that I observed healed\r\nremarkably well, and in good position, in spite of the fact that many of\r\nthe patients objected to wear any form of splint.\r\n\r\nThe most special feature was the occurrence of notched fractures,\r\ncorresponding to the type wedges described in Chapter V. When these\r\nfractures were at the lower margin of the bone, the buccal cavity\r\noccasionally escaped in spite of considerable comminution, the latter\r\nconfining itself to the basal portion of the bone.\r\n\r\nWhen the base of the teeth, or the alveolus, was struck, a wedge was\r\noften broken away, and from the apex of the resulting gap a fracture\r\nextended to the lower margin of the bone.\r\n\r\nWhen fractures of the latter nature resulted from vertically coursing\r\nbullets, much trouble often ensued. I will quote two cases in\r\nillustration:--\r\n\r\n     (82) Wounded at Rooipoort. _Entry_ (Mauser), through the lower\r\n     lip; the bullet struck the base of the right lateral incisor\r\n     and canine teeth, knocked out a wedge, and becoming slightly\r\n     deflected, cut a vertical groove to the base of the mandible;\r\n     _exit_, in left submaxillary triangle. The bullet subsequently\r\n     re-entered the chest wall just below the clavicle, and escaped\r\n     at the anterior axillary fold. The appearance of these second\r\n     wounds suggested only slight setting up of the bullet; the\r\n     original impact was no doubt of an oblique or lateral\r\n     character.\r\n\r\n     The injury was followed by free haemorrhage and remarkably\r\n     abundant salivation (I was inclined to think that the latter\r\n     symptom was particularly well marked in gunshot fractures of\r\n     the body of the mandible), and very great swelling of the floor\r\n     of the mouth.\r\n\r\n     The patient could not bear any form of apparatus, but was\r\n     assiduous in washing out his mouth, and made a good recovery,\r\n     the fragments being in good apposition.\r\n\r\n     (83) _Entry_ (Mauser), over the right malar eminence; the\r\n     bullet carried away all the right upper and lower molars,\r\n     fractured the mandible, and was retained in the neck.\r\n\r\n     A fortnight later an abscess formed in the lower part of the\r\n     neck, which was opened (Mr. Pooley), and portions of the mantle\r\n     and leaden core, together with numerous fragments of the teeth,\r\n     were removed. The bullet had undergone fragmentation on impact,\r\n     probably on the last one (teeth of mandible), and still\r\n     retained sufficient force to enter the neck.\r\n\r\nThis case affords an interesting example of transmission of force from\r\nthe bullet to the teeth, and bears on the theory of explosive action.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of fractures of the upper jaw, interference was rarely\r\nneeded. In the case of the mandible, a remark has already been made as\r\nto the advisability of removing fragments when the neck of the condyle\r\nhas suffered comminution. The removal of loose fragments is necessary in\r\nall cases in which the buccal cavity is involved. Experience in fracture\r\nof the limbs has shown a tendency to quiet necrosis when comminution was\r\nsevere, in spite of primary union. This is no doubt dependent on the\r\nvery free separation of fragments on the entry and exit aspects from\r\ntheir enveloping periosteum. In the case of the mandible, considerable\r\nnecrosis is inevitable, and much time is saved by the primary removal of\r\nall actually loose fragments.\r\n\r\nA splint of the ordinary chin-cap type with a four-tailed bandage meets\r\nall further requirements, but the patients often object to them. Cases\r\nin which the fragments could be fixed by wiring the teeth were not\r\ncommon, as the latter had so frequently been carried away. The usual\r\nprecautions as to maintaining oral asepsis were especially necessary.\r\n\r\nThe results of fractures of the mandible were, in so far as my\r\nexperience went, remarkably good, as deformity was seldom considerable.\r\nThe absence of obliquity and the effect of primary local shock were no\r\ndoubt favourable elements, little primary displacement from muscular\r\naction occurring.\r\n\r\nWounds of the _cheek_ healed readily, and the same was noticeable of the\r\nlips. Wounds of the _tongue_ healed with remarkable rapidity when of the\r\nsimple perforating type, often with little or no swelling or evidence of\r\ncontusion. At the end of a few days it was often difficult to localise\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject a remarkable case which occurred at the\r\nfighting at Koodoosberg Drift is worthy of mention, although the\r\nprojectile was a shell fragment and not a bullet of small calibre.\r\n\r\n     (84) A Highlander was the unfortunate possessor of an entire\r\n     set of upper teeth set in a gold plate. A small fragment of a\r\n     shell perforated the upper lip by an irregular aperture, and\r\n     struck the teeth in such a manner as to turn the posterior edge\r\n     of the plate towards the tongue, which latter was cut into two\r\n     halves transversely through to the base.\r\n\r\n     The patient asserted that the plate had been driven down his\r\n     throat, but nothing was palpable either in the fauces or on\r\n     external examination of the neck. He spoke distinctly, but\r\n     there was dysphagia as far as solids were concerned.\r\n\r\n     On the second day swelling of the neck due to early cellulitis\r\n     developed, especially on the left side, and signs of laryngeal\r\n     obstruction became prominent. Chloroform was administered, but\r\n     on the introduction of the finger into the fauces, respiration\r\n     failed and a hasty tracheotomy had to be performed. No foreign\r\n     body was palpable with the finger in the pharynx.\r\n\r\n     Tracheitis and septic pneumonia developed, and the man died of\r\n     acute septicaemia thirty-six hours later. Death occurred just as\r\n     the Division received marching orders, and no _post-mortem_\r\n     examination was made. As a result of palpation at the time of\r\n     the tracheotomy, the probabilities seemed against the presence\r\n     of the tooth plate in the pharynx, but the absence of positive\r\n     evidence scarcely allows the case to be certainly classed as\r\n     one of cellulitis and septicaemia secondary to wound of the\r\n     tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE NECK\r\n\r\nWounds of the neck were not unfrequent and were of the gravest\r\nimportance; there can be little doubt that they accounted for a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the deaths on the field. On the other hand,\r\nthe neck as a region offered some of the most striking examples of\r\nhairbreadth escape of important structures. Consideration of a number of\r\nthe vascular lesions (see cervical aneurisms, p. 135) also shows\r\nconclusively that in no region did the small size of the bullet more\r\nmaterially influence the result, since no doubt can exist that all these\r\nwounds would have proved immediately fatal if produced by projectiles of\r\nlarger calibre.\r\n\r\nIn this place only a few general considerations will be entered into, as\r\nmost of the important cases are dealt with under the general headings of\r\nvessels, nerves, and spine; but it is convenient to include here the few\r\nremarks that have to be made concerning the cervical viscera.\r\n\r\nThe wounds of the soft parts might course in any direction, but vertical\r\ntracks from above downwards were rare. In point of fact, these occurred\r\nonly in connection with perforations of the head, and as vertical wounds\r\nof the latter were received in the prone position, usually when the head\r\nwas raised, the necessary conditions for longitudinal tracks were seldom\r\noffered. One case of a complete vertical track in the muscles of the\r\nback of the neck has been already quoted (No. 69, p. 286).\r\n\r\nTracks coursing upwards from the trunk were somewhat more frequent in\r\noccurrence; thus a considerable number traversing the thorax were seen.\r\nIn such instances the aperture of exit was generally situated in the\r\nposterior triangle, and some of the brachial nerves often suffered.\r\n\r\nThe commonest forms of wound were the transverse or the oblique. A large\r\nnumber of cases with such tracks will be found among the cases of injury\r\nto the cervical vessels and nerves. In some instances the course was\r\nrestricted to the neck alone, in others the trunk or upper extremity was\r\nalso implicated.\r\n\r\nThe favourable influence of the arrangement of the structures of the\r\nneck, which allows of the ordinary displacement excursions necessary for\r\ndeglutition, respiration, and their cognate movements, was very strongly\r\nmarked. Thus in several cases the bullet traversed the neck behind the\r\npharynx and oesophagus without injuring either viscus, and the escape\r\nof the main vessels and nerves was equally striking. In such wounds the\r\nwedge-like bullet without doubt separated and displaced all these\r\nstructures, causing mere superficial contusion.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the latter statement, the rarity of direct sagittal\r\nwounds in the hospitals should be mentioned. This is probably to be\r\nexplained by the facts that wounds in the mid-line of the neck\r\nimplicated the cervical spinal cord, and that sagittal wounds\r\nimplicating the vessels were apt to lead more directly to the surface,\r\nand thus external haemorrhage was favoured. A few examples of cervical\r\ntracks will suffice to illustrate these remarks:--\r\n\r\n     (85) _Entry_ (Lee-Metford), below angle of scapula; _exit_,\r\n     centre of posterior triangle. Injury to the lung, and\r\n     haemothorax. No damage to neck structures.\r\n\r\n     (86) _Entry_ (Mauser), over Pomum Adami; _exit_, below right\r\n     scapular spine. Median and musculo-spiral paralysis.\r\n\r\n     (87) _Entry_, a large oval aperture through ninth right rib,\r\n     1/2 an inch external to scapular angle; _exit_, anterior border\r\n     of sterno-mastoid opposite Pomum Adami. Second entry, opposite\r\n     angle of mandible; exit, in centre of cheek.\r\n\r\n     Wound of lung. Musculo-spiral paralysis still persisting at the\r\n     end of nine months.\r\n\r\n     (88) _Entry_ (Mauser), 2 inches above left clavicle at margin\r\n     of trapezius; _exit_, 1 inch from sternum in left first\r\n     intercostal space. Contusion of brachial plexus, with mixed\r\n     signs, which disappeared in two months. No signs of vascular\r\n     injury.\r\n\r\nSee also cases of cervical aneurism, &c.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the pharynx._--I saw only three cases of wound of the\r\npharynx; in each the injury was in the nasal or buccal segment of the\r\ncavity, and in each the soft palate was injured, in two instances the\r\nwound being a small perforation.\r\n\r\nAll three cases belong to the somewhat miraculous class. The first (89)\r\nwas the only one in which the wound gave rise to subsequent trouble. The\r\nsecond was under the charge of Mr. Bowlby, and will no doubt be more\r\nfully recounted by him, as interesting signs of injury to the cervical\r\ncord were present. In the third the occipital neuralgia was the only\r\ntroublesome symptom.\r\n\r\nIn both cases 90 and 91 the high position of the wound in the fixed\r\nportion of the pharynx no doubt accounted for the absence of any\r\ninfective trouble.\r\n\r\n     (89) _Wounds of the pharynx._--_Entry_ (Lee-Metford),\r\n     immediately below the tip of right mastoid process; the bullet\r\n     traversed the neck, entering the pharynx close to the right\r\n     tonsil, crossed the cavity of the pharynx and the mouth,\r\n     emerging through the left cheek. Great swelling of the fauces\r\n     and dysphagia persisted for some days after the injury, and\r\n     there was considerable haemorrhage.\r\n\r\n     Infection of the posterior portion of the track from the\r\n     pharynx resulted, and suppuration continued for some weeks: a\r\n     small sequestrum eventually needed to be removed from the tip\r\n     of the transverse process of the atlas.\r\n\r\n     (90) _Entry_ (Mauser), through mouth; the bullet pierced the\r\n     soft palate and the posterior wall of the pharynx, and passed\r\n     out between the transverse process of atlas and the occiput. No\r\n     serious pharyngeal symptoms.\r\n\r\n     (91) _Entry_ (Mauser), through the mouth, knocking out the left\r\n     upper canine and bicuspid teeth. Perforation of the soft palate\r\n     just to the right of the base of the uvula and the posterior\r\n     wall of the pharynx; _exit_, 1-1/2 inch internal to and 1/2 an\r\n     inch below the tip of the right mastoid process. Haemorrhage\r\n     persisted for half an hour, and the patient could not swallow\r\n     solids for a week. Great occipital neuralgia followed the\r\n     wound.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the larynx._--I saw only one wound of the larynx (see No. 10,\r\np. 135). In this instance the thyroid cartilage was wounded on either\r\nside at the level of the Pomum Adami. Transitory haemorrhage and signs of\r\noedema were the only signs referable to the wound, but in addition the\r\nbullet contused the left vagus and gave rise to temporary laryngeal\r\nparalysis. The same course was observed in a second case of perforation\r\nof the larynx of which I was told.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the trachea._--The two cases recounted below are the only\r\ntracheal injuries I met with; in one the oesophagus was also\r\nimplicated. This patient died from mediastinal emphysema. In the second\r\ncase the wide development of emphysema was prevented by the early\r\nintroduction of a tracheotomy tube.\r\n\r\n     (92) _Entry_ (Mauser), on the outer side of the right arm,\r\n     3-1/2 inches below the acromion; _exit_, 3 inches below the tip\r\n     of the left mastoid process, through the sterno-mastoid. Thirty\r\n     six hours later there was very free haemorrhage into the right\r\n     posterior triangle, emphysema at the episternal notch,\r\n     dysphagia, and complete obliteration of the cardiac area of\r\n     dulness. Respiration was rapid (40) and extremely noisy. Pulse\r\n     130, small and weak.\r\n\r\n     A tracheotomy was performed (Mr. Stewart), but the patient died\r\n     an hour later. When the operation was performed a considerable\r\n     amount of mucus from the oesophagus was discovered in the\r\n     wound. The bullet had passed obliquely between trachea and\r\n     oesophagus, wounding both tubes.\r\n\r\n     (93) _Entry_, at the centre of the margin of the left\r\n     trapezius; _exit_, in mid line of the neck over the trachea.\r\n     Dyspnoea was noted the next morning, which increased during a\r\n     journey in a wagon. On the third day the dyspnoea was more\r\n     troublesome and emphysema began to develop in the neck. A\r\n     tracheotomy was performed (Mr. Hunter), and the tube was kept\r\n     in for four days. No further trouble was experienced, and the\r\n     wound shortly closed, and the patient, a surgeon, returned to\r\n     his duties. Temporary signs of median nerve concussion and\r\n     contusion were noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN AND SPINAL CORD\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery degree of local injury to the constituent vertebrae and the\r\ncontents of the spinal canal was met with considerable frequency. Pure\r\nuncomplicated fractures of the bones were of minor importance, except in\r\nso far as they exemplified the general tendency to localised injury in\r\nsmall-calibre bullet wounds. Injuries implicating the spinal medulla, on\r\nthe other hand, were proportionately the most fatal of any in the whole\r\nbody to the wounded who left the field of battle or Field hospital\r\nalive, and these cases formed one of the most painful and distressing\r\nfeatures of the surgery of the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe prognostic gravity of any spinal injury depended upon two factors:\r\nfirst, the obvious one of relative contiguity or direct implication of\r\nthe cord or nerves in the wound track; secondly, the degree of velocity\r\nretained by the bullet at the moment of impact with the spine.\r\nObservation of the serious ill effects produced by bullets passing in\r\nthe immediate proximity of large strongly ensheathed peripheral nerves\r\nsurrounded by soft tissue, such as those of the arm or thigh, would lead\r\none to expect that a comparatively thin-clad bundle of delicate nerve\r\ntissue like the spinal cord, enclosed in a bony canal so well disposed\r\nfor the conveyance of vibrations, would suffer severely, and such proved\r\nto be the case.\r\n\r\n_Fractures in their relation to nerve injury_ will be first dealt with,\r\nand secondly injuries to the cord itself.\r\n\r\nIsolated fractures of the processes were not uncommon, the determination\r\nof the injury to anyone being naturally dependent on the position and\r\ndirection taken by the wound track.\r\n\r\nFor implication of the _transverse processes_ sagittal wounds coursing\r\nin varying degrees of obliquity were mainly responsible. Such injuries\r\nmight be unaccompanied by any nerve lesion. Thus a Boer received a\r\nLee-Metford wound at Belmont which passed from just below the tip of the\r\nright mastoid process across the pharynx and through the opposite cheek.\r\nNo bone damage was at first suspected; suppuration in the neck, however,\r\nfollowed infection from the pharynx, and when a sinus which persisted\r\nwas opened up later, a number of small comminuted fragments were found\r\ndetached from the transverse process of the axis. In other cases more or\r\nless severe symptoms of nerve lesion were observed, varying from\r\ntransient hyperaesthesia, due to implication of the issuing nerves, to\r\nsymptoms of spinal haemorrhage, such as are portrayed in the following:--\r\n\r\n     (94) A private in the Black Watch was wounded at Magersfontein\r\n     from within a distance of 1,000 yards. Among other wounds, one\r\n     track entered 1 inch to the right of the second lumbar spinous\r\n     process, and emerged 1 inch internal to the right anterior\r\n     superior iliac spine. There were signs of wound of the kidney,\r\n     and in addition, retention of urine, incontinence of faeces,\r\n     complete motor and sensory paralysis of the right lower\r\n     extremity, and total absence of all reflexes. Anaesthesia\r\n     existed over the whole area of skin supplied by the nerves of\r\n     the sacral plexus, hyperaesthesia over that supplied by the\r\n     lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n     On the tenth day subsequent to the injury, the hyperaesthesia in\r\n     the area of lumbar supply was replaced by normal sensation,\r\n     motor power began to be slowly regained in the muscles supplied\r\n     by the anterior crural and obturator nerves, and the patellar\r\n     reflex returned. At this time lowered sensation returned in the\r\n     area supplied by the sacral plexus, but no improvement in motor\r\n     power took place, and no control was regained over the bladder\r\n     and rectum.\r\n\r\n     During the succeeding week some sciatic hyperaesthesia\r\n     developed, but on the twenty-eighth day the patient developed\r\n     secondary peritonitis from other causes and died on the\r\n     thirty-first. A fracture of the transverse process existed, but\r\n     unfortunately the spinal canal was not opened for examination\r\n     and no details can be given as to the condition of the cord.\r\n     (See case 201, p. 463.)\r\n\r\nFractures of the _spinous processes_, or those involving both the\r\nprocess and laminae, were not uncommon. Isolated separation of the\r\nspinous process was usually the result of wounds crossing the back\r\nobliquely or transversely. Examples of this injury were numerous,\r\nespecially in the dorsal region, as being the most prominent,\r\nparticularly when the patients assumed the prone position when advancing\r\non the enemy.\r\n\r\nCervical injuries, owing to the comparatively sheltered position of the\r\nmore deeply sunk spines, and from the fact that the head was usually\r\nunder cover of a stone or ant-heap, were less common; in one instance\r\nhyperaesthesia was noted in one upper extremity as the result of a\r\ncrossing bullet having struck the fourth cervical spine. In a man\r\nwounded at Paardeberg Drift the bullet entered at the centre of the\r\nbuttock, traversed the bones of the pelvis, and, leaving that cavity\r\nabove the crest of the ilium, crossed the spine to emerge in the\r\nopposite loin. Suppuration occurred, and when the wound was laid open\r\nthe third and fourth lumbar spinous processes were found to be loosened,\r\nbut still connected to the surrounding soft parts. There were no nerve\r\nsymptoms in this case; these would not have been expected, since by the\r\ntime that the bullet had traversed the bones of the pelvis its velocity\r\nmust have been considerably lessened, even if high at the moment of\r\nprimary impact. In another case a dorsal spine, together with its\r\nlamina, was separated and moveable; the only nerve symptoms were slight\r\npain and a crop of herpes on the line of distribution of the\r\ncorresponding intercostal nerve, the bullet having probably struck the\r\nnerve in passing across the intercostal space. In one instance of a\r\nretained bullet lying beneath the skin of the back, its passage between\r\ntwo contiguous dorsal spines without fracture of either was determined\r\nduring an extraction operation.\r\n\r\nWhen the prone position was assumed by the men, more or less\r\nlongitudinal wounds in the course of the spine were naturally liable to\r\noccur. These tracks assumed somewhat greater importance than the\r\ntransverse ones, because the injury to bone was more often multiple, and\r\nthe laminae were frequently implicated. The relative importance of such\r\ninjuries was dependent on the velocity of the bullet and the depth at\r\nwhich it travelled. As an instance of a more serious character the\r\nfollowing may be given:--\r\n\r\n     (95) In a Highlander wounded at Magersfontein, probably at a\r\n     range within 1,000 yards, the bullet entered at the right side\r\n     of the sixth cervical vertebra; tracking downwards, it loosened\r\n     the laminae of the fifth and sixth dorsal vertebrae from the\r\n     pedicles, and separated the tip of the seventh spine. The\r\n     bullet was extracted from beneath the skin at the latter spot,\r\n     its force having been no doubt exhausted by the resistance of\r\n     the firm neural arches supported by the weight of the man's\r\n     body. Symptoms of total transverse lesion of the cord followed,\r\n     and the patient died at the end of fifty-four days. The bone\r\n     had not apparently been sufficiently depressed to exert\r\n     continuous pressure, but the cord was diffluent and actually\r\n     destroyed over an area corresponding with the fourth, fifth,\r\n     sixth, and seventh dorsal segments.\r\n\r\nI saw no instance of wound of the _neural arch_ from a direct shot in\r\nthe back in any of our men, neither was I ever able to detect an injury\r\nto the articular processes as a localised lesion.\r\n\r\nInjuries to the _centra_ were very frequent, but differed\r\nextraordinarily in their importance. Perforation by bullets travelling\r\nat a relatively low grade of velocity, but still one sufficient to allow\r\nthem to pass through the body, produced in many instances no symptoms\r\nwhatever when the track did not lie in immediate contiguity to the\r\nspinal canal or perforate it.\r\n\r\nIn all the wounds which I had the opportunity of examining post mortem,\r\nthe fracture was of the nature of a pure perforation of the cancellous\r\ntissue of the centrum, with no comminution beyond slight splintering of\r\nthe compact tissue at the aperture of exit. In one instance the bullet\r\npassed in a coronal direction so close to the back of the centrum as to\r\nleave a septum of only the thickness of stout paper between the track\r\nand the spinal canal. In this case signs of total transverse lesion were\r\npresent. I never happened to meet with a case in which the canal was\r\nencroached upon from the front by displaced bone. In some cases at the\r\nend of six weeks there was difficulty in determining the position of the\r\nopenings, and section of the bone was necessary in order to assure\r\noneself as to the direction of the track.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the centra were pierced in the coronal direction with\r\nvarying degrees of obliquity; in others the direction was more sagittal;\r\nin two of the latter the bullet was retained in the spinal canal. The\r\ntracks were sometimes confined to one vertebra, but often implicated\r\ntwo. In others the bullet passed longitudinally through the thorax,\r\ngrooving or perforating one or more centra.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying evidences of nerve injury varied from nil to those of\r\npressure or irritation of the nerve roots, transient signs of spinal\r\nconcussion, signs of contusion and haemorrhage, or to evidence of total\r\ntransverse lesion. Instances of all these conditions will be quoted\r\nunder the heading of injuries to the cord or nerves.\r\n\r\n_Signs of injury to the vertebrae._--Separation of the spinous processes\r\nwas often indicated by slight deformity, either evident or palpable,\r\nlocal pain, tenderness, mobility, and crepitus. In some cases these\r\nlocal signs were reinforced by evidence of cord injury. Fractures\r\ninvolving the laminae differed merely in the degree to which the above\r\nsigns were developed. Fractures of the transverse processes were\r\ngenerally only to be assumed from the position and direction of the\r\nwounds, the assumption being sometimes strengthened in probability by\r\nevidence of injury to the cord and nerves.\r\n\r\nFractures of the centra were also frequently only to be assumed from the\r\ndirection of the wound tracks, and possibly from evidence of nerve\r\ninjury. When no paralysis supervened, interference with the movements of\r\nthe back, or pain, was so slight as to be inappreciable, especially in\r\nthe presence of concurrent injury to other parts, which was seldom\r\nabsent. I only once saw any angular deformity from this injury, and that\r\nslight, and not apparent before the end of three weeks. In this\r\nparticular a very striking difference exists between injuries from\r\nsmall-calibre bullets and larger ones such as the Martini-Henry. In the\r\nonly instance of Martini-Henry fracture of the spine that came under my\r\nnotice, the centrum was severely comminuted and deformity was obvious.\r\nStill, as in so many particulars, the difference was only one of degree,\r\nsince comminution of the centra in gunshot wounds has always been\r\nobserved to be slight in nature compared with what is met with in the\r\ncompression fractures of civil life.\r\n\r\nA few words will suffice to dismiss the questions of diagnosis,\r\nprognosis, and treatment of the above injuries. The diagnosis depended\r\non attention to the signs above indicated, the prognosis almost entirely\r\non the concurrent injury to the nervous system, which will be considered\r\nlater, and the treatment consisted in enforcing rest alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE SPINAL CORD ACCOMPANYING SMALL-CALIBRE BULLET WOUNDS OF\r\nTHE VERTEBRAE\r\n\r\n_Anatomical lesions._--In introducing the subject of the nature of the\r\nlesions of the spinal cord and membranes, I should again enforce the\r\nstatement that their character and degree, in comparison with the slight\r\naccompanying bone damage, are pathognomonic of gunshot wounds, and that\r\nthese characters find their completest exemplification in injuries\r\nproduced by bullets of small calibre, endowed with a high grade of\r\nvelocity. Again, that the varying degrees of damage depend comparatively\r\nslightly on the position of the bone lesion, apart from actual\r\nencroachment on the canal, while the degree of velocity retained by the\r\nbullet at the moment of impact is all-important. In no other way are the\r\ndivergent results to be explained which follow an apparently identical\r\ninjury, in so far as extent, position, and external evidence of damage\r\nto the spinal column are concerned.\r\n\r\nInjuries to the nerve roots of the nature of concussion and contusion,\r\nare dealt with in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\n_Pure concussion_ of the spinal cord may, I believe, be studied from a\r\nbetter standpoint in the case of small-calibre bullet injuries than in\r\nany others, since in many instances it is, I think, possible to exclude\r\nany complications such as wrenches and strains of the vertebral column,\r\nand ascribe the symptoms to the pure effect of extreme vibratory force\r\ncommunicated to the cord by its enveloping bony canal. The condition\r\nmust be considered under the two headings of slight and severe.\r\n\r\nIn _slight concussion_ the usually transient effects of the injury, and\r\nits happy tendency not to destroy life, place us in a state of\r\nuncertainty as to the occurrence of anatomical changes, since no\r\nopportunity of post-mortem examination occurred. The clinical condition\r\nincluded under this term corresponds with that implied in 'spinal\r\nconcussion' in civil practice. One point of extreme interest, whether\r\nthe subjects of small-calibre bullet spinal concussion will in the\r\nfuture suffer from the remote effects common to similar sufferers in\r\ncivil life from other causes such as railway collisions, still remains\r\nfor future determination. An ample field for such observations has at\r\nany rate been created by the present war.\r\n\r\nIn _severe concussion_ a far more highly destructive action is exerted.\r\nThis condition may be followed by complete disorganisation of the cord,\r\naccompanied or not by multiple parenchymatous haemorrhages into its\r\nsubstance. Either or both of these pathological conditions are produced\r\nby the impact of the bullet with the spine, given a sufficiently high\r\ndegree of velocity, and it is difficult to separate clinically the\r\nresulting symptoms. This is a matter perhaps of less importance, since\r\nit stands to reason that a vibratory force, capable of rupturing the\r\nspinal capillaries, would at the same time damage the nervous tissue.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of concussion of this degree, it should be clearly\r\nrecognised that a general condition, such as is indicated by the use of\r\nthe term 'concussion of the brain,' is in no wise implied. The condition\r\nis really far more nearly allied to one of contusion, a strictly\r\nlocalised portion of the spinal cord undergoing the destructive process\r\nwhich affects the segments below only in so far as it interrupts the\r\nnormal channels of communication with the higher centres.\r\n\r\nCase 102 is an instance of such a lesion, the post-mortem examination\r\nshowing clearly that the spinal canal was not encroached upon by the\r\nbullet. The cord in this instance appeared little changed\r\nmacroscopically, and this fact was observed in other instances, both\r\nduring operations and post mortem.\r\n\r\n_Contusion._--This condition is very closely allied to the last. In\r\ncases 101 and 103 the spinal canal was as little encroached upon as in\r\n102, but the bullet struck the somewhat elastic neural arch in each\r\ncase, and post mortem an adhesion between the cord and the enveloping\r\ndura opposite the point at which impact of the bullet was closest\r\nsuggests that, in spite of the escape of the bone from fracture, it may\r\nhave been momentarily depressed to a sufficient degree to contuse the\r\ncord, or the latter may have suffered a _contre-coup_ injury. For these\r\nreasons the inclusion of the cases as instances of pure concussion is\r\nnot warranted. In both Nos. 99 and 100 the neural arch had actually\r\nsuffered fracture, and although the bone was not depressed or exercising\r\npressure at the time of the autopsies, it was no doubt driven in\r\ntemporarily at the moment of impact of the bullet.\r\n\r\nAt the post-mortem examinations of injuries of this nature it was common\r\nto find one to four segments of the spinal cord completely disorganised.\r\nAt the end of some five weeks, the common duration of life, the\r\nstructure of the cord was represented by a semi-diffluent yellowish\r\nmaterial, the consistence of which was so deficient in firmness as to\r\nallow the partial collapse of the membranes covering the affected\r\nportion, so as to exhibit a definite narrowing when the whole was held\r\nup (see fig. 79). In such cases traces of extra- or intra-dural\r\nhaemorrhage sometimes still persisted.\r\n\r\n_Haemorrhage._--This occurred as surface extravasation and in the form of\r\nparenchymatous haemorrhages. I saw the former both in the extra-dural and\r\nperi-pial forms, but never in sufficient quantity to exert a degree of\r\npressure calculated to produce symptoms of total transverse lesion. Here\r\nagain, however, it is difficult to speak with confidence since the\r\nconditions which regulate the tension within the normal spinal canal are\r\nso complicated and liable to variation, that it is very difficult to\r\nestimate the effect of any given haemorrhage discovered.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mr. R. H. Mills-Roberts described to me one fatal case under\r\nhis care in the Welsh Hospital in which extra-dural haemorrhage was so\r\nabundant as, in his opinion, to have taken a prominent part in the\r\nproduction of the paralytic symptoms.\r\n\r\nExamples of both extra- and intra-dural (peri-pial) haemorrhage are\r\nafforded by cases 99, 102, and 103; in none was it large in amount or\r\nwidely distributed. The condition was probably also frequently\r\nassociated in varying degree with that to be immediately described\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n_Intra-medullary haemorrhage_ (_haemato-myelia_).--The importance of this\r\ncondition is lessened in small-calibre bullet injuries by the fact\r\nalready alluded to, that it is almost invariably accompanied by\r\nconcussion changes. In one instance in which death took place at the end\r\nof eight days, partly as the result of concurrent injury, in a man in\r\nwhom signs of total transverse lesion of the cord were present, the\r\nsubstance of the cord was found to be closely scattered over with\r\nhaemorrhages of various sizes and extending for a longitudinal area of\r\nsome three inches.\r\n\r\nAs to the frequency with which haemorrhage into the substance of the cord\r\noccurred, I regret to be unable to give an opinion. In the late\r\npost-mortem examinations I witnessed, a yellow discoloration of the\r\nsoftened cord was the only macroscopic evidence of haemorrhage.\r\n\r\nHaemorrhages of this nature may, however, account for the grave paralytic\r\nsymptoms in some cases of partial or total transverse lesion not due to\r\ndirect compression or laceration.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of concussion, contusion, or haematomyelia were, I\r\nbelieve, responsible for at least nine-tenths of the cases in which a\r\ntotal transverse lesion was indicated by the symptoms. The extreme\r\nimportance of realising this fact and the rarity of the production of\r\nsymptoms by continuing compression both from the prognostic and the\r\ntherapeutic point of view is obvious.\r\n\r\nThe analogous injuries termed generally in Chapter IX. nerve contusion,\r\nalthough frequently accompanied by tissue destruction, may be followed\r\nby reparative change, and are capable of complete or almost complete\r\nspontaneous recovery; while the lesions in the spinal cord are\r\npermanent, and complete recovery is only witnessed in the parts affected\r\nby the remote pressure or irritation from blood extravasation, or in\r\nthose influenced by concussion.\r\n\r\nI include below short abstracts of all the cases of lesion of the spinal\r\ncord which terminated fatally, in which I had the opportunity of\r\nwitnessing the post-mortem conditions. In a considerable proportion of\r\nthe cases at the end of six weeks the spinal cord was softened over an\r\narea of from two to four segments in such degree as to have practically\r\nlost all continuity. Although the autopsies were made on patients who\r\nhad died slowly and in summer weather, often twelve to sixteen hours\r\nafter death, I think it can be but fair to assume, when the consistency\r\nof the remaining portion of the spinal cord is considered, that the\r\nsoftening was only in slight degree if at all exaggerated by post-mortem\r\nchange. Again symptoms of secondary myelitis and meningitis had been\r\nobserved in some of the fatal cases prior to death.\r\n\r\nI had but one opportunity of observing a case in which a retained bullet\r\nexercised compression, and none in which this was due to displaced bone\r\nfragments. I also only once came across a case of complete section, but\r\nno doubt both bone pressure and section may have occurred with greater\r\nfrequency amongst patients dying on the field or shortly after. The case\r\nof section is illustrated in fig. 80. It will be noted that, although\r\nthe section is complete, the bullet lies to one side of the canal, and\r\nhence the bullet, as fixed in its course by the bone of the centrum,\r\ndirectly struck but half of the whole width of the cord.\r\n\r\nIt was striking how little secondary change in the cord had occurred in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the spot of division. This well illustrates the\r\ncomparatively slight vibratory effect of a bullet travelling with a\r\ndegree of velocity insufficient to completely perforate the vertebral\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of injury to the spinal cord._--In _slight spinal concussion_\r\nthese exactly resembled those of the more severe lesions, except in\r\ntheir transitory nature. They consisted in loss of cutaneous\r\nsensibility, motor paralysis, and vesical and rectal incompetence. The\r\nphenomena persisted from periods of a few hours to two or three days,\r\nreturn of function being first noticeable in the sensory nerves, and\r\noften with modification in the way of lowered acuteness, or minor signs\r\nof irritation, such as formication, slight hyperaesthesia or pain,\r\npointing to a combination with the least extensive degrees of\r\nhaemorrhage; later, motor power was rapidly regained. The subjects of\r\nsuch symptoms often suffered from weakness and unsteadiness in movement\r\nfor some days or weeks; a sharp line of discrimination between such\r\ncases and those described in the next paragraphs is manifestly\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n_Spinal haemorrhage._--The symptoms of this condition developed\r\ndifferently according to whether concurrent concussion existed.\r\nOccasionally very typical instances of pure haemorrhage were observed\r\nwith transient symptoms:--\r\n\r\n     (96) A private in the Yorkshire Light Infantry was wounded at\r\n     Modder River; the bullet entered between the eleventh and\r\n     twelfth ribs, just posterior to the left mid-axillary line,\r\n     emerging in the posterior axillary fold, at its junction with\r\n     the right side of the trunk. On the second day after the injury\r\n     the lower extremities became drawn up, the knees and hips\r\n     assuming a flexed position, and this was followed shortly by\r\n     the advent of complete motor and sensory paraplegia,\r\n     accompanied by retention of urine. Two days later, the patient\r\n     again passed water normally, and gradual and rapid return of\r\n     both sensation and motor power took place. At the end of\r\n     fourteen days no trace of the condition remained, and the\r\n     patient was shortly after sent home.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms, however, were rarely so simple as in this example; it was\r\nvery much more common to meet with an admixture of signs of primary\r\nconcussion, or at any rate symptoms of radiation. The following is an\r\nextreme but excellent example of more complicated and prolonged effects:\r\n\r\n     (97) A lance-corporal of the Black Watch was wounded at\r\n     Magersfontein at a range of from 400 to 500 yards. The bullet\r\n     entered over the left malar bone 2-1/2 inches from the outer\r\n     canthus, while the aperture of exit was 2-1/4 inches above the\r\n     inferior angle of the right scapula, 3/4 of an inch anterior to\r\n     its axillary margin.\r\n\r\n     Very shortly after the injury complete motor and sensory\r\n     paralysis developed in both upper extremities, followed by the\r\n     development of a similar condition in the left lower limb, and\r\n     retention of urine and faeces, but the latter unaccompanied by\r\n     the marked abdominal intestinal distension so characteristic in\r\n     cases of total transverse lesion. The right side of the chest\r\n     continued to work well, but the intercostals of the left side\r\n     were paralysed. No disturbance of the normal action or\r\n     condition of the pupils was noted. After the first few days the\r\n     condition began to improve.\r\n\r\n     Three weeks later, the chest was moving symmetrically and well,\r\n     sensation and motor power had returned in considerable degree\r\n     in the left lower extremity, with marked increase in both the\r\n     plantar and patellar reflexes; sensation had returned in both\r\n     upper extremities, a slight amount of motor power was regained\r\n     in the right, but the left remained entirely flaccid and\r\n     incapable of movement.\r\n\r\n     At the end of a month power was regained over both bladder and\r\n     rectum, some slight movement of the left thumb was possible,\r\n     and a certain degree of hyperaesthesia developed over the back\r\n     of the forearm.\r\n\r\n     At the end of six weeks there was little further alteration,\r\n     but that in the direction of improvement. There was some\r\n     wasting of the muscles of the left upper extremity, and this\r\n     was most marked in the muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve.\r\n\r\n     At the end of ten weeks the patient had been up some days; he\r\n     could stand and walk, but was unable to rise from the sitting\r\n     posture without help. The plantar and patellar reflexes were\r\n     much exaggerated, and there was ankle clonus, most marked in\r\n     the left limb. The right upper extremity was normal, but weak;\r\n     there was wrist-drop on the left side and the deltoid was\r\n     wasted and powerless; on the other hand the fingers could be\r\n     flexed, and although the elbow could not be, there were signs\r\n     of returning power in the biceps, and some movements of the\r\n     shoulder could be performed by the capsular muscles. It was\r\n     remarkable that common sensation was more acute in the left\r\n     than the right lower extremity, but I attributed this to the\r\n     remains of hyperaesthesia on the left side. The patient left for\r\n     home shortly after the last note.\r\n\r\nIn both these cases the absence of marked hyperaesthesia or pain points\r\nto medullary haemorrhage (haemato-myelia) as the pathological condition\r\nproduced by the injury. In this particular they contrast well with case\r\n94 quoted on page 315, where the degree of both hyperaesthesia and pain\r\nindicated a combination of pressure and irritation of the nerve roots by\r\nsurface haemorrhage on the affected side. In case 97 the persistence for\r\nfour weeks of paralysis of the bladder and rectum suggested medullary\r\nhaemorrhage in addition, while the return of patellar reflex in the\r\nparalysed limb negatived the occurrence of an extensive destructive\r\nlesion.\r\n\r\nIn view of the extreme interest of these cases I will shortly detail one\r\nother in which the cauda equina alone was affected.\r\n\r\nI must confess my inability to place the case definitely in the\r\ncategory either of concussion or medullary haemorrhage. As so often\r\nhappened, both conditions probably took part in the lesion. The\r\nimmediate development of the primary symptoms is no doubt to be referred\r\nto concussion, while the patchy nature of the prolonged lesion and\r\ngradual recession of the symptoms point to the presence of haemorrhages.\r\nWe find here the link most nearly connecting the spinal cord and the\r\nperipheral systemic nerves. Such a case goes far to show that the\r\ncondition which I have in the next chapter often referred to as nerve\r\ncontusion may in fact be produced by an injury far short of actual\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\n     (98) A trooper in the Imperial Yeomanry, while advancing in the\r\n     crouching attitude, was struck by a bullet from his left front,\r\n     at an estimated distance of 300 yards. The bullet traversed the\r\n     right arm anteriorly to the humerus, entered the trunk in the\r\n     line of the posterior axillary fold, 1-1/2 inch below the level\r\n     of the nipple, crossed the thoracic and abdominal cavities,\r\n     deeply striking the lumbar spine, and finally lodged beneath\r\n     the skin over the venter of the left ilium. The skin was\r\n     broken, but the force of the bullet was not sufficient to cause\r\n     it to pass through, and it was later expressed from the wound\r\n     by the surgeon. The bullet was a Mauser, and not in any way\r\n     deformed, although it must at any rate have struck the spine\r\n     and perforated the ilium.\r\n\r\n     Immediate paraplegia resulted, both sensation and motor power\r\n     were completely abolished, but there was no trouble either with\r\n     the bladder or rectum. No symptoms of injury to either thoracic\r\n     or abdominal viscera were noted.\r\n\r\n     Three days after the injury sensation and some return of motor\r\n     power were observed in the left extremity, and some power of\r\n     movement in the toes of the right foot.\r\n\r\n     During the next eight weeks steady but slow improvement took\r\n     place; during the last three weeks of this period he made the\r\n     voyage to England. Ever since the injury some elevation of\r\n     temperature was noted, a rise at night to 100 deg. or at times to\r\n     102 deg.; for this no definite cause was discovered. In the tenth\r\n     week the condition was as follows: The temperature has become\r\n     normal. The patient has lost flesh to a considerable extent\r\n     since the reception of the injury. The lower extremities are\r\n     much wasted, especially the peroneal muscles. Patellar reflexes\r\n     can be obtained, but the knee jerks are uncertain. Unevenly\r\n     distributed paralysis exists in both lower extremities.\r\n     Left--Sensation fairly good throughout. Quadriceps very weak;\r\n     does not react to electrical stimulation. Calf muscles act\r\n     fairly. Anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous groups are\r\n     paralysed. Right--Quadriceps acts better than on left, muscles\r\n     below the knee paralysed, and in the same area there is\r\n     complete absence of sensation. The patient complains of\r\n     shooting pains in both legs, and there is some deep muscular\r\n     tenderness.\r\n\r\n     Three weeks later an abundant crop of vesicles appeared over\r\n     the front of the right thigh and leg, above and below the knee.\r\n     Sensation in the limb at the same time returned to a\r\n     considerable degree, anaesthesia persisting on the outer aspect\r\n     of the thigh only.\r\n\r\n     At the end of four months very considerable improvement had\r\n     taken place, but there was no return of motor power in the\r\n     right leg, or the muscles supplied by the peroneal nerve in the\r\n     left leg. There was some general oedema of the legs,\r\n     especially of the right, possibly in connection with the\r\n     herpetic eruption which was now disappearing. Muscular\r\n     tenderness had disappeared. There was also definite improvement\r\n     in the size and tone of the peroneal muscles, although no motor\r\n     power was regained.\r\n\r\n     At the end of five months, slight gradual improvement was still\r\n     taking place, but the loss of power was nearly as extensive as\r\n     when the last note was taken. The skin of the right leg was\r\n     glossy, that of the left apparently normal. At times some\r\n     hyperaesthesia of the soles was noted, and the plantar reflex\r\n     was very brisk.\r\n\r\n     The right anterior tibial and musculo-cutaneous groups of\r\n     muscles reacted to the strongest faradic current, not to any\r\n     galvanic current below 20-25 m.a., contraction very sluggish.\r\n     The same muscles in the left leg also reacted to the strongest\r\n     faradic current, but only locally, with no sort of effect on\r\n     the tendons. Similar contractions could be induced in the right\r\n     quadriceps, but none in the left (Dr. Turney).\r\n\r\n     Appreciation of heat and cold applied to the skin was fair,\r\n     but, in the case of heat, distinctly slow in the right leg and\r\n     foot.\r\n\r\n     At the end of seven months improvement was still taking place;\r\n     the patient could now stand, walk a little with crutches, and\r\n     even ascend and descend a staircase.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Severe concussion, contusion, or medullary haemorrhage\r\n     producing signs of total transverse lesion, and complete\r\n     transverse section._--The symptoms of these conditions will be\r\n     taken together, because, with very slight variations, they may\r\n     be considered as lesions of equal degree as to severity, bad\r\n     prognosis, and unsuitability for active interference.\r\n\r\n     All were characterised by the exhibition of the same essential\r\n     phenomena, symmetrical abolition of sensation and motor power\r\n     on either side of the body, absence of any signs of irritation\r\n     in the paralysed area, and loss of patellar reflex. In a small\r\n     number of the cases of medullary haemorrhage some return of\r\n     sensation was observed prior to death; in a still smaller,\r\n     traces of motor power, and in one or two irritability of the\r\n     muscles or feeble reflexes pointed to the fact that destruction\r\n     of the cord was not absolute. As abstracts of a series of cases\r\n     are appended on page 330, it is only necessary to add a few\r\n     remarks as to any slight peculiarities which seemed directly\r\n     dependent on the mode of causation.\r\n\r\n     It may be first stated that these severe injuries were\r\n     accompanied by signs of a very high degree of shock. In fact,\r\n     the shock observed in them was more severe than in any other\r\n     small-calibre bullet injuries that I witnessed. The patients\r\n     lay still with the eyes closed, great pallor of surface,\r\n     sometimes moaning with pain, the sensorium much benumbed, or\r\n     occasionally early delirium was noted. The pulse was small,\r\n     often slow and irregular, and the respiration shallow. The\r\n     originally quiet state was often changed to one of great\r\n     restlessness of the unparalysed part of the body, with the\r\n     appearance of reaction.\r\n\r\n     The degree of primary pain varied greatly, but as a rule it was\r\n     considerable; in some cases it was excruciating in the parts\r\n     above the level of the totally destructive lesion, and commonly\r\n     of the zonal variety. A hyperaesthetic zone at the lower limit\r\n     of sensation usually existed.\r\n\r\n     In the majority of the cases pain must have depended on\r\n     meningeal haemorrhage. In one of the cases related, positive\r\n     evidence was offered as to this particular by the autopsy,\r\n     although this was made as long as six weeks after the original\r\n     injury, since no other source of pressure or irritation was\r\n     discovered. When I first saw this patient some twenty-four\r\n     hours after the injury he was moaning with pain, although a\r\n     strong and plucky man; I hastened to give him an injection of\r\n     morphia, and assured him that it would relieve his suffering:\r\n     as I left I heard him say to his neighbour: 'That is no use;\r\n     they gave me three last night, and I was no better,' and his\r\n     remark proved true.\r\n\r\n     In high dorsal and cervical injuries the temperature rose high,\r\n     in one case to 108 deg. F.; I had no opportunity, however, of\r\n     observing the temperature in any case immediately before and\r\n     after death. During the hot weather the profuse sweating of the\r\n     upper part of the body contrasted very strongly with the dry\r\n     skin of the paralysed part.\r\n\r\n     The heart's action was often particularly irregular in the\r\n     dorsal injuries, and the respiration slow and irregular; as\r\n     these cases, however, were often complicated by severe\r\n     concurrent injuries to internal organs, the irregularities\r\n     could hardly be ascribed to the spinal-cord lesion alone. In\r\n     cases of pure diaphragmatic respiration, the rate did not as a\r\n     rule exceed the normal of 16 or 20 to the minute, and it was\r\n     quite regular; this was noted soon after the injury and\r\n     persisted throughout the course of the cases. As is usually the\r\n     case, both respiration and the heart's action were most\r\n     embarrassed in the cases in which abdominal distension was a\r\n     prominent feature. In some of the neck cases the Cheyne-Stokes\r\n     type of respiration was very strongly marked.\r\n\r\n     In cases of low dorsal injury intestinal distension was\r\n     extreme, and I think more troublesome than the same condition\r\n     as seen in civil practice. The distension was accompanied by\r\n     most persistent vomiting, continuing for days, and in the cases\r\n     that lived for some time severe gastric crises of the same type\r\n     occurred in some instances.\r\n\r\n     Priapism was a common symptom; but, as is seen from the cases\r\n     quoted, was rarely due to any gross direct laceration of the\r\n     cord.\r\n\r\n     Trophic sores were both early to develop, and extensive;\r\n     primary decubitus occurred in all the cases I saw, and steady\r\n     extension followed. In one case a remarkable symmetrical\r\n     serpiginous ulceration developed in the area of distribution of\r\n     the cutaneous branches of the external popliteal nerve on the\r\n     outer side of the leg.\r\n\r\n     The paralysis in nearly every case was of the utterly flaccid\r\n     type, and wasting of the muscles was early and extreme. This\r\n     was occasionally accentuated by the supervention of myelitis.\r\n\r\n     Opportunities for making observations on the quantity of urine\r\n     secreted were not great, and I can offer no remark as to the\r\n     occurrence of polyuria. In one rapidly fatal case, however,\r\n     suppression of urine occurred.\r\n\r\n     (99) _Lumbar region. Transverse lesion._--Range under 1,000\r\n     yards. Wound of _entry_ (Mauser), over the seventh rib 1 inch\r\n     from the left posterior axillary fold; _exit_, over the centre\r\n     of the right iliac crest. Complete symmetrical motor and\r\n     sensory paralysis of lower extremities, entire abolition of\r\n     reflexes, retention of urine.\r\n\r\n     On the ninth day there was some return of sensation in the\r\n     lower extremities, and a cremasteric reflex was to be obtained.\r\n     A large bedsore had developed over the sacrum. No further\r\n     change occurred in the lower extremities. The patient became\r\n     progressively emaciated and exhausted, cystitis persisted, the\r\n     bedsore deepened. The man eventually developed signs of a large\r\n     basal abscess in the left lung, and died on the forty-second\r\n     day.\r\n\r\n     At the _post-mortem_ a fracture of the first lumbar lamina was\r\n     discovered, with some splintering of the bone; the lumbar\r\n     spinous process was attached and in its normal position.\r\n     Opposite the centre of the cauda equina were the remains of a\r\n     considerable haemorrhage, both extra- and intra-dural, the\r\n     nerves appearing somewhat compressed, but of normal\r\n     consistency. The muscles of the back were infiltrated with\r\n     putrid pus on both sides. A pulmonary abscess cavity the size\r\n     of a hen's egg occupied the upper part of the lower lobe of the\r\n     left lung. The kidneys were congested, and the bladder\r\n     thickened and chronically inflamed.\r\n\r\n     (100) _Cervico-dorsal region. Total transverse lesion._--Wound\r\n     of _entry_ (Mauser), to the right of the sixth cervical\r\n     vertebra: the bullet was removed on the field from the left of\r\n     the seventh dorsal spinous process, which was somewhat\r\n     prominent. Complete motor and sensory paralysis extended\r\n     upwards to the third intercostal space; the breathing was\r\n     almost entirely diaphragmatic. Retention of urine. Entire\r\n     abolition of reflexes in lower limbs and trunk. Hyperaesthesia\r\n     was present in both upper extremities, with a zone of\r\n     hyperaesthesia around the chest. The patient suffered greatly\r\n     for some weeks from pain in the hyperaesthetic area, he\r\n     developed severe cystitis and later incontinence of urine. A\r\n     large trophic sacral bed-sore steadily increased in depth and\r\n     size.\r\n\r\n     About ten days before death, which occurred on the fifty-third\r\n     day from exhaustion and septicaemia, the patient complained of\r\n     pains in his legs; but there was no return of sensation,\r\n     motion, or reflexes.\r\n\r\n     At the _post-mortem_, the seventh dorsal spinous process was\r\n     found to be loose and the laminae of the fifth, sixth, and\r\n     seventh vertebrae were separated from the pedicles, and somewhat\r\n     depressed on the left side. These laminae were adherent to the\r\n     dura, as were also a few small separated bony spiculae. There\r\n     was no sign of old haemorrhage. The spinal cord was practically\r\n     gone between the levels of the fourth and seventh dorsal\r\n     vertebrae, and diffluent from myelitis up to the third cervical.\r\n\r\n     (101) _Dorsal region; total transverse lesion._--Wound of\r\n     _entry_ (Mauser), in the left supra-spinous fossa of the\r\n     scapula; _exit_, between the eleventh and twelfth ribs of the\r\n     right side. Complete motor and sensory paralysis, with absence\r\n     of reflexes from mid-dorsal region downwards. Upper\r\n     intercostals working. Retention of urine, penis turgid.\r\n     Sensation perfect to lower extremity of sternum. Early trophic\r\n     sacral bed-sores developed and steadily increased in depth and\r\n     extent, slighter ones developed on the heels. The paralysis was\r\n     flaccid throughout. The patient gradually emaciated with fever,\r\n     and died on the seventy-eighth day.\r\n\r\n     At the _post-mortem_ the wound proved not to have penetrated\r\n     the thorax, and both the vertebral spines and laminae were\r\n     intact, no trace of bony injury being discoverable. Opposite\r\n     the sixth dorsal vertebra, for a distance of 1-1/2 inch, the\r\n     cord and dura were adherent, and over the same area the cord\r\n     was represented by soft custard-like material. There was no\r\n     sign of old haemorrhage.\r\n\r\n     (102) _Dorsal region; total transverse lesion; slight\r\n     extra-dural haemorrhage._--Wound of _entry_ (Mauser), at the\r\n     posterior aspect of the right shoulder; _exit_, 2 inches to the\r\n     left of the spine below the ninth rib.\r\n\r\n     Complete motor and sensory paralysis below the site of the\r\n     lesion, with absence of superficial and deep reflexes.\r\n     Retention of urine. Great abdominal distension, pain, and\r\n     vomiting. Bed-sores over the sacrum developed on the third day;\r\n     meanwhile the vomiting continued on and off for a week, and\r\n     very severe girdle pain persisted.\r\n\r\n     One month later when seen at the Base hospital considerable\r\n     improvement had occurred. Sensation had returned in both lower\r\n     limbs; but flaccid paralysis persisted and both were wasted,\r\n     especially the left. There was no return of reflexes in the\r\n     lower limbs, the urine was passed in gushes, and the patient\r\n     was cognisant when these occurred. The sacral bed-sores were,\r\n     however, very extensive and becoming larger and deeper.\r\n\r\n     At the end of the fifth week slight power was regained in the\r\n     flexors and abductors of the right thigh, and the same muscles\r\n     of the left limb could be made to contract feebly. Meanwhile\r\n     the patient suffered with severe fever, accompanied by frequent\r\n     rigors and profuse sweats; the bed-sore continued to extend,\r\n     and the urine was foul and contained pus.\r\n\r\n     The patient continued in a similar condition, progressive\r\n     emaciation and exhaustion taking place, and at the end of six\r\n     weeks he died.\r\n\r\n     At the _post-mortem_ the bullet was found to have tracked\r\n     beneath the right scapula, entering the chest by the fifth\r\n     intercostal space and lacerating the right lung; thence it\r\n     entered the eighth dorsal centrum and tunnelled both this and\r\n     the ninth diagonally, to escape beneath the ninth rib. On\r\n     opening the spinal canal the tunnel was found to be separated\r\n     only by the compact tissue of the centrum from the cavity,\r\n     while a thin extra-dural haemorrhage separated the dura from the\r\n     bones anteriorly. The spinal cord exhibited no sign of pressure\r\n     and was firm and continuous, but up to the lower limit of the\r\n     dorsal region there was septic myelitis and meningitis, the\r\n     result of pus having tracked up the canal from the sacral\r\n     bedsore. Suppurative cystitis and pyelitis were present. The\r\n     patient was the subject of an old urethral stricture which had\r\n     given rise to trouble during treatment.\r\n\r\n     (103) _Dorsal region; total transverse lesion; slight\r\n     intra-dural haemorrhage._--Wound of _entry_ (Mauser), below\r\n     spine of scapula, close to right axilla; _exit_, 2-1/2 inches\r\n     to left of tenth dorsal spinous process.\r\n\r\n     Complete motor and sensory paralysis below ensiform cartilage,\r\n     with well-marked hyperaesthetic zone around trunk. All reflexes\r\n     absent. Retention of urine. Incontinence of faeces. Bed-sores in\r\n     sacral region developed during the first two days, and\r\n     seventeen days later well-developed serpiginous trophic sores\r\n     developed on the outer side of each leg and continued to\r\n     increase slowly until death. The paralysis remained of the\r\n     absolutely flaccid variety. Great emaciation occurred,\r\n     accompanied by hectic fever, the temperature ranging from\r\n     normal to 102.5 deg.. During the third week double pleurisy\r\n     developed.\r\n\r\n     At the _post-mortem_ no bone injury could be detected. The cord\r\n     and dura-mater were adherent over an area corresponding to the\r\n     fifth to the eighth dorsal vertebrae, and opposite the seventh\r\n     the cord was soft and of the consistence of butter. A small\r\n     intra-dural haemorrhage was still evident below the main lesion,\r\n     not extensive enough to give rise to serious compression.\r\n     General adhesions in each pleura. Cystitis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--Appearance of Spinal Cord enclosed in membranes\r\nin case 103 after removal from the canal. When the membranes were opened\r\na white custard-like substance took the place of the cord. Slight\r\nevidence of extra-dural haemorrhage existed]\r\n\r\n     (104) _Dorsal region; section of cord; retained bullet._--Wound\r\n     of _entry_ (Mauser), in seventh right intercostal space, 4-1/2\r\n     inches from the dorsal spinous processes, oval in outline;\r\n     bullet retained.\r\n\r\n     Complete motor and sensory paralysis, with absence of reflexes\r\n     below umbilicus. Retention of urine, incontinence of faeces.\r\n     Large sacral bed-sore developed rapidly. Right haemothorax.\r\n\r\n     The patient emaciated rapidly, and for the last fourteen days\r\n     the temperature ranged to 104 deg., the bed-sore steadily\r\n     increasing in size. Death occurred on the forty-second day.\r\n\r\n     At the _post-mortem_ a Mauser bullet was found embedded in the\r\n     centrum of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. The bullet was slightly\r\n     curved; its anterior extremity had passed across the spinal\r\n     canal, and wounding the dura posteriorly rested against the\r\n     left lamina. The plating of the mantle of the bullet was\r\n     stripped from half the area of the tip. The dura was not\r\n     adherent, and the cord was softened for half an inch above the\r\n     point of section; above this it was normal, the vessels\r\n     coursing normally to the softened spot. Below the point of\r\n     section the cord was blanched, but offered no other macroscopic\r\n     evidence of disease. No evidence of either intra- or\r\n     extra-dural haemorrhage was detectible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Complete division of Spinal Cord. The bullet is\r\nretained, and from its position can be seen to have struck the right\r\nhalf of the cord only. The nickel plating of half of the tip of the\r\nbullet is stripped off. Case No. 104]\r\n\r\n     The right pleura contained a large quantity of dark cocoa-like\r\n     fluid. Extensive adhesions were present in both pleural\r\n     cavities. The spleen was much enlarged. At the base of the\r\n     bladder a large submucous haemorrhage had occurred, the\r\n     blood-clot had assumed a dark orange colour, and on first\r\n     opening the viscus the appearance was that of a mass of faeces.\r\n     The mucous lining elsewhere was slaty grey, with small\r\n     haemorrhages. The kidneys were large, but no abscesses or\r\n     pyelitis were present.\r\n\r\n     (105) _Cervico-dorsal region; total transverse lesion._--Wound\r\n     of _entry_ (Mauser), opposite right sixth cervical transverse\r\n     process; _exit_, on left side of third dorsal spinous process.\r\n     Slight grasping power was present in the hands, and the patient\r\n     could hold his arms across his chest. Complete motor and\r\n     sensory paralysis, with absence of all reflexes below. The\r\n     pupils were moderately contracted. Retention of urine. On the\r\n     second day blebs appeared on each buttock, and the patient\r\n     complained of very severe pain in the neck: the temperature\r\n     rose to 103 deg., and on the third day he died suddenly. No\r\n     _post-mortem_ examination was made.\r\n\r\nI observed two similar cases in the Field Hospital at Orange River, the\r\npatients dying on the third day; pain and high temperature were\r\nprominent symptoms in both. In one patient early delirium was present.\r\n\r\n     (106) _Dorsal region; Martini-Henry wound._--Wound of _entry_,\r\n     oval, 1 inch x 3-1/4 inches; long axis obliquely crossing\r\n     infra-spinous fossa of right scapula; bullet retained\r\n     (Martini-Henry). Spine of third dorsal vertebra loose, and a\r\n     distinct thickening to its right side. Complete symmetrical\r\n     paralysis extending up to upper extremities. No sensation on\r\n     surface of trunk below cervical area. Respiration entirely\r\n     diaphragmatic. Retention of urine, penis turgid. Total absence\r\n     of reflexes, superficial and deep. Reddening of buttocks, but\r\n     no bullae.\r\n\r\n     General hyperaesthesia of upper extremities, with severe\r\n     spasmodic attacks of pain.\r\n\r\n     On the third day an exploration was decided upon, in view of\r\n     the local deformity, and the severe pain in the upper\r\n     extremities. The third dorsal spine was found to be loose, as a\r\n     result of bilateral fracture of the neural arch; the bullet had\r\n     crossed the right limit of the spinal canal, and destroyed the\r\n     body of the vertebra, and passing onwards had entered the left\r\n     pleural cavity, into which air entered freely from the\r\n     operation wound.\r\n\r\n     The patient was relieved from his pain by the exploration, and\r\n     lived four days. On the second day after operation, however,\r\n     the temperature rose to 107 deg., while on the last two days the\r\n     temperature was normal in the mornings, rising to 105 deg. in the\r\n     evenings. No alteration resulted in the trunk symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The pure question of the fact of injury of the spinal cord\r\nneeds no discussion; but it is necessary to make some remarks on the\r\ndiscrimination between concussion, contusion and haemorrhage, meningeal\r\nand medullary haemorrhage, the latter condition and compression, and on\r\npartial and complete severance of the cord.\r\n\r\nThe sharp discrimination of cases of concussion from those of slight\r\nmedullary haemorrhage was necessarily impossible. I think the only points\r\nof any importance in diagnosing pure concussion were the transitory\r\nnature of the symptoms, and the uniformity of recovery, without\r\npersistence of any signs of minor destructive lesion. In medullary\r\nhaemorrhage the tendency for a certain period was towards increase in\r\ngravity in the signs. It goes almost without saying that the latter\r\npoint was seldom accurately determined in patients struck on the field\r\nof battle; these perhaps lay out for hours before they were brought in,\r\nand when they were placed in the Field hospital the rush of work did not\r\nusually allow the careful observation necessary to clear up this\r\ndifference in the development of the symptoms. Nevertheless it is\r\npreferable to consider the cases in which transitory symptoms persist\r\nfor a period of hours, or even a couple of days, as instances of pure\r\nconcussion, unless the existence of this condition can be disproved by\r\nactual observation.\r\n\r\nExtra-medullary haemorrhage, accompanied by only slight encroachment on\r\nthe spinal canal, certainly results with some frequency from\r\nsmall-calibre wounds. Some of the quoted cases show this decisively by\r\n_post-mortem_ evidence, others by such clinical signs of irritation as\r\npain and hyperaesthesia. I think its presence may also be assumed in\r\ncases of total transverse lesion due to medullary haemorrhage or severe\r\nconcussion, accompanied by well-marked pain and hyperaesthesia above the\r\nlevel of paralysis. As affecting treatment, however, determination of\r\nits presence is of small importance.\r\n\r\nThe important conditions for discriminative diagnosis are those of local\r\ncompression, actual destructive lesion, whether from concussion changes,\r\ncontusion, or medullary haemorrhage, and partial and total section of the\r\ncord.\r\n\r\nFirst, with regard to compression of the cord, the possible sources are\r\nthree; (i) extra-dural haemorrhage, which may, I think, be dismissed with\r\nmention as rarely capable of producing severe symptoms. (ii) The\r\ndisplacement of bone fragments. This is of less importance than in civil\r\npractice, because an injury by a bullet of small calibre, capable of\r\nseriously displacing fragments, has probably at the same time produced\r\ngrave changes in the cord. In the presence of severe immediate symptoms\r\nwe may tentatively assume that a simultaneous destructive lesion has\r\nbeen produced. In such injuries pain, combined with a tendency to\r\nimprovement in the paralytic symptoms and return of reflexes, is the\r\nonly point in favour of bone pressure, unless considerable deformity of\r\nthe spinal column can be detected by palpation or examination with the\r\nX-rays.\r\n\r\n(iii) Pressure from the bullet. This is the most important form of\r\ncompression, because the mere fact of retention of the bullet is\r\nevidence of a low degree of velocity, and therefore opposed to the\r\nexistence of the most severe form of intramedullary lesion. In a case of\r\napparent transverse lesion with retained bullet, shown to me at No. 3\r\nGeneral Hospital by Mr. J. E. Ker, the pain was very severe, and so\r\ngreatly aggravated by movement that an anaesthetic had to be administered\r\nprior to the renewal of some necessary dressings. The general condition\r\nof this patient precluded a projected operation, and after death the\r\nbullet was found to be pressing laterally upon a cord not materially\r\naltered on macroscopic inspection. In the case of retained bullet\r\nrecorded (No. 104), the slight degree to which the severed ends of the\r\ncord appeared altered has been already remarked upon.\r\n\r\nBeyond this we are helped by the position of the aperture of entry, and\r\nits shape, as evidence of the direction in which the bullet passed, the\r\npresence of pain, and positive proof may be obtained by examination with\r\nthe X-rays.\r\n\r\nLastly, we come to the discrimination of total or partial section,\r\ndestruction by vibratory concussion or contusion, and severe\r\nintramedullary haemorrhage. Except in the case of partial section with\r\nlocalised symptoms, which must be rare, I believe this to be impossible\r\nfrom the primary symptoms, although some indication of possible\r\nencroachment on the canal may be obtained from careful consideration of\r\nthe course of the wound, as evidenced by the position and shape of the\r\nopenings, the position of the patient's body at the time of reception of\r\nthe injury being taken into consideration. Later we may get some aid\r\nfrom the possible improvement in the symptoms in the case of haemorrhage.\r\nIn cases with signs of total transverse lesion, however, the\r\ndiscrimination of the conditions is of little practical importance,\r\nsince either is equally unfavourable and unsuitable for surgical\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn closing these remarks reference must be made to the occasional\r\noccurrence of paraplegic symptoms of an apparently purely functional\r\nnature. I saw these on one or two occasions, of which the following is\r\na fair example. A man was wounded in the lower extremity and fell. When\r\nbrought into the hospital he complained of loss of power in the legs and\r\ninability to straighten his back. No very definite evidence was present\r\nof serious impairment either of motor or sensory nerves, and the man was\r\ngot up and walked with crutches. While moving about the hospital camp,\r\nanother man pushed him down, and the patient then became completely\r\nparaplegic. He was placed in bed, and the next day moved his limbs\r\nwithout any difficulty, and gave rise to no further anxiety.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--In slight concussion the importance of prognosis is as to\r\nremote effects, and upon this no opinion can be given at the present\r\ntime. The same may be said concerning cases in which transient symptoms\r\nfollowed the slighter degrees of surface and medullary haemorrhage. In\r\nthe case of the latter, however, I think it would be rash to give a too\r\nconfident opinion as to the future non-occurrence of secondary changes.\r\n\r\nSevere concussion is probably irrecoverable.\r\n\r\nMeningeal haemorrhage of either form is one of the slighter lesions, and\r\nless dangerous, both as an immediate condition and as to the\r\nprobabilities of after trouble. None the less the possibilities of\r\nsecondary chronic meningitis, or chronic trouble from adhesions, must be\r\nkept in mind.\r\n\r\nCases of medullary haemorrhage with incomplete signs are favourable in\r\nprognosis, as far as life is concerned; as to complete recovery,\r\nhowever, this is hardly possible; in many cases serious functional\r\ndeficiency at any rate will remain, while in others the healing of the\r\nlacerated tissue and subsequent contraction can scarcely fail to\r\ninfluence unfavourably an already imperfect recovery.\r\n\r\nI think it must be a rare occurrence for pressure from bone fragments to\r\nbe able to be regarded as a favourable prognostic condition, since in\r\nthe very large majority of cases the velocity of the bullet causing the\r\ninjury will have been such as to inflict irreparable damage on the cord.\r\nStill, cases may occasionally be met with where the velocity has been\r\nsufficiently low, or contact with the bone slight enough, to allow of\r\nthe comparative escape of the cord. In this relation cases in which the\r\nbullet is retained, especially if the symptoms of transverse lesion are\r\nincomplete, may be regarded as relatively favourable.\r\n\r\nCervical and high dorsal injuries, as in civil practice, offered the\r\nworst prognosis. In cases in which symptoms of total transverse lesion\r\nwere present, as far as my experience went, it was, however, only a\r\nmatter of importance as to the prolongation of a miserable existence.\r\nAll the patients eventually died; those with higher lesions at the end\r\nof a few days; the lower ones, at the completion on an average of six\r\nweeks of suffering.\r\n\r\nThe actual causes of death resembled exactly those met with in civil\r\npractice, except in so far as it was more often influenced or determined\r\nby concurrent injuries, a complication so characteristic of modern\r\ngunshot wounds. Thus exhaustion, septicaemia from absorption from\r\nsuppurating bed-sores or from severe cystitis, secondary myelitis, and\r\npulmonary complications, carried off most of the patients.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The general treatment of the cases demanded nothing\r\nspecial to military surgery, except in so far as it was modified by the\r\ndisadvantage to the patient of necessarily having to be transported,\r\noften for some distance. The ill effects of this, particularly in cases\r\nof haemorrhage, are obvious, but in so far as fracture was concerned the\r\nquestion of transport did not acquire the importance that it does in\r\ncivil practice, since the nature of the fractures and their strict\r\nlocalisation did not render movement either painful or particularly\r\nhurtful. It was indeed striking how little pain movement, made for the\r\npurposes of examination, caused these patients. The treatment of\r\nbed-sores, cystitis, or other secondary complications possessed no\r\nspecial features.\r\n\r\nThe importance of insuring rest in the early stages of the cases of\r\nhaemorrhage is self-evident; hence, if the possibility exists of not\r\nmoving the patient, its advantage cannot be too strongly insisted upon.\r\nAgain, if transport is inevitable, the shorter distance that can be\r\narranged for the better. It should be borne in mind, also, that from the\r\npeculiar nature of causation of the injuries, stretcher or wagon\r\ntransport for short distances is preferable to the vibratory movements\r\nof a long railway journey. Beyond this the administration of opium, and\r\nin some cases the assumption of the prone position, are both useful in\r\nthe recent or possibly progressive stage of haemorrhage.\r\n\r\nLastly, as to active surgical treatment by operation. In no form of\r\nspinal injury is this less often indicated, or less likely to be useful.\r\nIt is useless in the cases of severe concussion, contusion, or medullary\r\nhaemorrhage which form such a very large proportion of those exhibiting\r\ntotal tranverse lesion, and equally unsuited to cases of partial lesion\r\nof the same character. Extra-medullary haemorrhage can rarely be\r\nextensive enough to produce signs calling for the mechanical relief of\r\npressure; the section of the cord cannot be remedied. In one case with\r\nsigns of total transverse lesion, in which a laminectomy was performed,\r\nno apparent lesion was discovered, and this would frequently be the\r\ncase, since the damage is parenchymatous. The experience was indeed\r\nexactly comparable to that which followed early exposure of the\r\nperipheral nerves.\r\n\r\nOnly three indications for operation exist. 1. Excessive pain in the\r\narea of the body above the paralysed segment; operation is here of\r\ndoubtful practical use, except in so far as it relieves the immediate\r\nsufferings of the patient.\r\n\r\n2. An incomplete or recovering lesion, when such is accompanied by\r\nevidence furnished by the position of the wounds, pain, and signs of\r\nirritation of pressure from without, or possibly palpable displacement\r\nof parts of the vertebra, that the spinal canal is encroached upon by\r\nfragments of bone.\r\n\r\n3. Retention of the bullet, accompanied by similar signs to those\r\ndetailed under 2.\r\n\r\nIn both the latter cases the aid of the X-rays should be invoked before\r\nresorting to exploration.\r\n\r\nOperation, if decided upon, in either of the two latter circumstances,\r\nmay be performed at any date up to six weeks; but if pressure be the\r\nactual source of trouble, it is obvious that the more promptly operation\r\nis undertaken the better for early relief and ulterior prognostic\r\nchances.\r\n\r\nIn only one case of the whole series I observed did it seem possible to\r\nregret the omission of an exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE PERIPHERAL NERVE TRUNKS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of these injuries has undoubtedly increased in frequency\r\nwith the employment of bullets of small calibre, and no other class of\r\ncase more strikingly illustrates the localised nature of the lesions\r\nproduced by small projectiles of high velocity. Again, no other series\r\nof injuries affords such obvious indications of the firm and resistent\r\nnature of the cicatricial tissue formed in the process of repair of\r\nsmall-calibre wounds, and in none is the advantage of a conservative and\r\nexpectant attitude so forcibly impressed upon the surgeon. Implication\r\nof the nerves may be primary, or secondary to an injury which left them\r\noriginally unscathed.\r\n\r\n_Nature of the anatomical lesions._--In degree these vary in\r\nmathematical progression, but the extent of the lesion is not always\r\nreadily differentiated by the early clinical manifestations, and again\r\nthe actual damage is not to be estimated by the gross apparent\r\nanatomical lesion alone; but, in addition, consists in part in changes\r\nof a less easily demonstrable nature, varying with the velocity with\r\nwhich the bullet was travelling and the consequent comparative degree of\r\nvibratory force to which the nerve has been subjected. In these\r\ninjuries, as in those of every part of the nervous system, the degree of\r\nvelocity appears to gain especial importance both in regard to the\r\ngeneral symptoms and the local effect on the functional capacity of the\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps a fitting place for the introduction of a few further\r\nremarks as to the significance of the term 'concussion' in connection\r\nwith the injuries produced by bullets of small calibre, since the most\r\nstriking exemplification of the results following the transmission of\r\nthe vibratory force of the projectile is afforded by the behaviour of\r\nthe comparatively densely ensheathed and supported peripheral nerves.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out in Chapters VII. and VIII. the chief concussion\r\neffects on the nervous tissue of the brain and spinal cord are of a\r\ndestructive nature, far exceeding those accompanying the injuries\r\ndesignated by the same term seen in the ordinary accidents met with in\r\ncivil practice, and this damage is comparatively localised in extent.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the peripheral nerves I have still employed the terms\r\n'concussion' and 'contusion' to designate certain groups of symptoms and\r\nclinical phenomena, but any sharp distinction between the two conditions\r\non a morbid anatomical basis is impossible. The results of severe\r\nvibratory concussion may, in fact, be more generally destructive than\r\nthose of contusion, and the subsequent effects more prolonged. A certain\r\nlength of the affected nerve is apparently completely destroyed as a\r\nconductor of impulses, the connective-tissue element alone remaining\r\nintact. Under these circumstances a nerve, the subject of the most\r\nserious degree of vibratory concussion, which, if cut down upon, may\r\nexhibit no macroscopic change, may take a longer period to recover than\r\none in which the presence of considerable local thickening points to\r\ndirect contact with the bullet, with resulting haemorrhage into the nerve\r\nsheath and perhaps partial gross rupture of nerve fibres.\r\n\r\nThe therapeutic and prognostic importance of the above remarks, if\r\ncorrect, is obvious. The course of the nerve is preserved by its intact\r\nconnective-tissue framework, and ultimate recovery by a regeneration of\r\nthe nerve fibres is more likely to be complete, and will be just as\r\nrapid, if nature be relied on and the nerve be left untouched by the\r\nhand of the surgeon.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, undeniable that nerve trunks may escape severe or\r\nirrecoverable injury by lateral displacement. The mere fact that the\r\ntrunk itself may be perforated by a slit in its long axis would suggest\r\nthe possibility of displacement of the whole structure, and this no\r\ndoubt occurred with some frequency. Displacement would naturally be most\r\nfrequent in the case of nerves, such as those of the arm, which run long\r\ncourses in comparatively loose tissue. In a remarkable case already\r\nnarrated, an exploratory operation showed the musculo-spiral nerve in\r\nthe upper part of the arm to have been driven into a loop which\r\nprojected into, and provisionally closed, an opening in the brachial\r\nartery.\r\n\r\nI. _Simple concussion._--Anatomically, or histologically, no information\r\nexists as to the changes which give rise to the often transitory\r\nsymptoms dependent on this condition. We are reduced to the same\r\ntheories of molecular disturbance and change which have been invoked to\r\naccount for similar affections of the central nervous system. The\r\ncausation of concussion is, however, materially influenced in its degree\r\nby the velocity of flight of the bullet and consequent severity of the\r\nvibratory force exerted. Hence actual contact of the bullet with the\r\nnerves is not necessary for its production, as is seen in the temporary\r\ncomplete loss of functional capacity in the limbs in many cases of\r\nfracture, where the vibrations are rendered still more far-reaching and\r\neffective as the result of their wider distribution from the larger\r\nsolid resistance afforded by the bone. The relative density and\r\nresistance offered by the different parts of the bone acquire great\r\nsignificance in this relation, since local shock due to nerve concussion\r\nis far more profound when the shafts are struck than when the cancellous\r\nends furnish the point of impact.\r\n\r\nThe form of concussion which most nearly interests us in this chapter is\r\nthat affecting single nerve trunks in wounds of the soft parts alone,\r\nand here the passage of the bullet is, as a rule, so contiguous to the\r\nnerve that there is difficulty in drawing a strict line of demarcation\r\nbetween such cases and those dealt with in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\nII. _Contusion._--Clinically this was the form of nerve injury both of\r\ngreatest comparative frequency and of interest from the points of view\r\nboth of diagnosis and prognosis.\r\n\r\nThe seriousness of a contusion depends on two factors: first, the\r\nrelative degree of violence exerted upon the nerve, which is dependent\r\non the force still retained by the travelling bullet; and, secondly, on\r\nthe extent of tissue actually implicated. The range of fire at which the\r\ninjury was received determines the importance of the first factor; the\r\nsecond varies with the degree of exactness with which the nerve is\r\nstruck, and on the direction taken by the bullet. Naturally transverse\r\nwounds affect a small area; while an oblique or longitudinal direction\r\nof the track may indefinitely increase the extent of injury to the nerve\r\ntrunk, and hence acquire prognostic significance in direct ratio to the\r\namount of tissue which needs to be regenerated.\r\n\r\nAs to the actual anatomical lesion resulting in the cases which we\r\ndesignated clinically as contusion I can give no information. On many\r\noccasions when the symptoms were considered of such a nature as to\r\nrender an exploration advisable, no macroscopic evidence of gross injury\r\nwas obtained. It was therefore impossible to draw a definite line of\r\ndemarcation between such cases and those which we considered merely\r\nconcussion. It could only be assumed that the vibration transmitted to\r\nthe nerve had occasioned such changes as to destroy its capacity as a\r\nconductor of impressions.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the presence of a certain amount of interstitial blood\r\nextravasation was suggested clinically by early hyperaesthesia and signs\r\nof irritation; in others the paralysis was of such a degree as to lead\r\nto the inference that a complete regeneration of the existing nerve\r\nwould be necessary prior to the restitution of functional capacity.\r\n\r\nIn a certain proportion of the injuries the development of a distinct\r\nfusiform swelling in the course of the nerve pointed to the existence of\r\nconsiderable tissue damage, while in others this was evidenced\r\nclinically by early signs of neuritis.\r\n\r\nIII. _Division or laceration._--The varying mechanical conditions\r\naffecting the last class of injury play a similar role here. Thus the\r\ndegree of laceration depends on the direction of the wound track, and as\r\nall lacerations are accompanied by contusion, the relative velocity\r\nretained by the travelling bullet assumes the same importance.\r\n\r\nI saw every degree of injury to the trunks, from notching to complete\r\nsolution of continuity, and in some cases destruction and disappearance\r\nof pieces from one to two or more inches in length. Such lesions as the\r\nlatter were most common in the forearm. In this segment of the limbs\r\ntracks of varying degrees of longitudinal obliquity are readily\r\nproduced, whether the patient be in the upright or prone position,\r\nsince the upper extremities are commonly in forward action whichever\r\nposition is assumed.\r\n\r\nThe most peculiar form of injury consisted in perforation of the trunk\r\nwithout gross destruction of its fibres, and without in many cases\r\nprolonged or permanent loss of functional capacity. I cannot speak with\r\nany confidence as to the comparative frequency of occurrence of this\r\nform of injury, but judging by the analogous perforations of the\r\nvessels, it is probably not uncommon in trunks large enough to allow of\r\nits production. The trunk nerves of the arm, and the great sciatic\r\nnerve, were probably the most frequent seats of such wounds. As,\r\nhowever, a very short experience of the futility of early interference\r\nin the case of nerve lesions warned me against exploration before a date\r\nat which observations of this nature were unsatisfactory, I gained less\r\nexperience on this point than I could have wished.\r\n\r\nIn the case of completely divided nerves the development of a bulbous\r\nenlargement on the proximal end was constant, and very marked in degree.\r\nI saw few cases in which primary effects could be certainly referred to\r\npressure or laceration by bone spicules, excepting in some fractures of\r\nthe humerus, and perhaps some injuries of the seventh nerve accompanying\r\nperforating wounds of the mastoid process.\r\n\r\nIV. _Secondary implication of the nerves._--This was a striking\r\ncharacteristic in many at first apparently simple wounds of the soft\r\nparts. In such cases it was due to implication of the contiguous trunk\r\nin the process of cicatrisation, and its importance varied with the size\r\nof the nerve in question. In the smaller sensory trunks it was often\r\nevidenced by the occurrence of neuralgic pain, especially liable to be\r\ninfluenced by climatic changes; in the larger, by signs of more or less\r\nsevere motor, sensory, and trophic disturbance. Musculo-spiral paralysis\r\nfrom implication in, or pressure from, callus in cases of fracture of\r\nthe humerus was very frequent. This would naturally be expected from the\r\nextreme degree the comminution of the bone often reached, and the\r\nconsequently large amount of callus developed.\r\n\r\nThe effect of cicatrisation of the tissues surrounding the nerves\r\nvaried somewhat according to the degree of fixation of the individual\r\nnerve implicated. Thus if a nerve lay in a fixed bed some form of\r\ncircular constriction resulted; if, on the other hand, the nerve was\r\nreadily displaceable, the cicatrix often drew it considerably out of its\r\ncourse; in either case symptoms corresponding with those of pressure\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of nerve lesion_.--These differed little in character from\r\nthose common to such injuries in civil practice, except in the relative\r\nfrequency with which they assumed a serious aspect. After all in civil\r\npractice nerve concussion is most familiar to us in the degree common\r\nafter knocking the elbow against a hard object, and the same may be said\r\nin regard to the allied injury of contusion. It is in small-calibre\r\nbullet wounds alone that the occurrence of such severe and sharply\r\nlocalised injury to deep parts as was observed is possible.\r\n\r\n_Concussion_.--Temporary loss of function was often observed in the\r\nlimbs, corresponding to the distribution of one or more nerve trunks\r\nwhen wound tracks had passed in their vicinity. Interference with\r\nfunction sometimes amounted to loss of sensation alone: in others to\r\nloss of both sensation and motor power. Such symptoms were of a\r\ntransitory character, lasting for a few days or a week; if both\r\nsensation and motion were impaired, sensation was usually the first to\r\nbe regained. In these cases secondary trouble was not uncommon, since\r\nthe near proximity of the track to the originally affected nerve offered\r\nevery chance for implication of the latter in the resulting cicatrix.\r\nThis sequence was often observed, and its symptoms are described under\r\nthe heading of secondary implication below. Equally striking were the\r\ninstances of concussion in the case of the nerves of special sense and\r\ntheir end organs, temporary loss of smell, vision, or hearing being not\r\nuncommon, often passing off in the course of a few days with no apparent\r\nulterior ill-effect.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting illustrations of the occurrence of\r\nconcussion was furnished by cases in which complete paralysis of a limb\r\nrapidly cleared up with the exception of that corresponding to a single\r\nindividual nerve of the complex apparently originally implicated.\r\nInstances of severe contusion or division of one nerve of the arm, for\r\ninstance, accompanied by transient signs of concussion of varying\r\ndegrees of severity in all the others, were by no means uncommon.\r\n\r\n_Contusion_.--The symptoms of contusion were somewhat less simple,\r\nsince, in addition to lowering or loss of function, signs of irritation\r\nwere often observed. In the slighter cases irritation was often a marked\r\nfeature, as was evidenced by hyperaesthesia and pain combined with loss\r\nof power. In cases in which pain and hyperaesthesia were primary\r\nsymptoms, these were often transitory. I will quote an illustrative case\r\nwhich, though affecting the nerve roots, is characteristic of the\r\neffects of slight contusion in the case of the nerve trunks in any part\r\nof their course:--\r\n\r\n     (107) _Contusion of cervical nerve roots_.--Range probably\r\n     about 1,000 yards. Wounded at Belmont. Aperture of _entry_\r\n     (Lee-Metford), immediately posterior to the right fifth\r\n     cervical transverse process; _exit_, immediately anterior to\r\n     the space between the third and fourth left cervical transverse\r\n     processes. The movements of the neck were perfect, there was\r\n     neither pain nor difficulty in swallowing. Extreme\r\n     hyperaesthesia was present in both palms and down the front of\r\n     the forearms. The grip in either hand was weak, this being\r\n     possibly explained in part by the hyperaesthesia of the palms,\r\n     as all movements of the upper extremities could be made,\r\n     although not with full power. On the fourth day the condition\r\n     was much improved on the left side, and at the end of a week\r\n     the left upper extremity was normal; the right (side of entry,\r\n     and therefore exposed to greater force from the bullet)\r\n     improved more slowly, becoming normal only at the end of three\r\n     weeks.\r\n\r\nI observed an identical case of injury to the cervical roots, and many\r\nsimilar instances in injuries of the nerve trunks of the limbs in which\r\nthe course was exactly parallel. In the more severe, pain was often\r\nadded to hyperaesthesia.\r\n\r\nIn the most severe cases the signs corresponded in all particulars,\r\nexcept in the early entire loss of reaction of the muscles to\r\nelectricity, with those of complete section. Loss of sensation and\r\nmotion was immediate, complete, and prolonged, the limbs being lowered\r\nin temperature, flaccid, and powerless. General systemic shock was also\r\nsevere. In the case either of plexus or multiple contusions, or where\r\nthe injury was more local, correspondingly complete signs were present\r\nin the area supplied by the affected nerves.\r\n\r\nIn the cases in which the contusion was not of extreme degree,\r\nhyperaesthesia often developed as a later sign, and was probably due to\r\nthe irritation of haemorrhage, when the sensory portion of the nerve\r\nbegan to regain functional capacity. The date of appearance of the\r\nhyperaesthesia varied from a few days to a week or later. It might then\r\npersist for weeks or many months.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances large blebs rose on the back of the hand, or patches\r\nof vesicles appeared over the terminal distribution of the nerve,\r\npointing to early trophic changes.\r\n\r\nThe period of recovery varied greatly; in some instances of very\r\ncomplete paralysis, function was regained and became apparently normal\r\nat the end of three or four weeks; in others, even after severe wasting\r\nof muscles for weeks, rapid improvement occurred often suddenly, while\r\nin some there was no apparent recovery at the end of months. In cases of\r\nlong-deferred improvement, wasting of the muscles became a very\r\nprominent feature; but this without complete loss of reaction of the\r\nmuscles to electrical stimulation.\r\n\r\nRecovery of sensation usually preceded by some time that of motion, the\r\nformer often reappearing in some degree at an early date, and, even if\r\nvery modified in character, it formed a most useful and valuable aid\r\nboth in diagnosis and prognosis.\r\n\r\nWhen in a position allowing of direct examination, the contused portion\r\nof the nerve sometimes developed a palpable fusiform thickening,\r\nmanipulation of which might give rise to formication in the area of\r\ndistribution--a favourable prognostic sign.\r\n\r\nMany of the cases bore a very marked resemblance in character to those\r\nin which paralysis results from tight constriction of the limb, as in\r\nthe arm after the application of an Esmarch's tourniquet.\r\n\r\n_Laceration._--If incomplete, the signs corresponded very nearly to\r\nthose of severe contusion, since partial section is impossible without\r\nthe occurrence of the latter. The condition indeed was only to be\r\ndistinguished by the partial nature of the recovery, and even this\r\nlatter might be only more prolonged.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks hold good with regard to perforation of the nerve\r\ntrunks; but, as regards function, these injuries are not so serious in\r\nprognosis as very much more limited transverse divisions or mere\r\nnotching, and in some cases the disturbance of function was by no means\r\nprofound or prolonged.\r\n\r\nAbsolute loss of reaction to electrical stimulus from above was the only\r\npathognomonic sign of actual section, unless the position of the nerve\r\nwas such as to allow of palpation, when the presence of a bulbous end at\r\nonce settled the difficulty. In many cases of superficial tracks with\r\ndivision of such nerves as the long or short saphenous, the early\r\ndevelopment of bulbs in the course of the trunks gave positive\r\ninformation, and these were often observed.\r\n\r\n_Traumatic neuritis._--This was a common sequence of contusion of the\r\nnerve itself, or of its subsequent inclusion in a cicatrix or callus. It\r\nwas evidenced by hyperaesthesia both superficial and deep, pain,\r\ncontracture, wasting of the muscles, local sweating, and the development\r\nof glossy skin.\r\n\r\nExamples of this condition were seen in the case of nearly every nerve\r\nin the body. In frequency of occurrence, degree of severity, and in its\r\nselection of individual nerves considerable variation was met with. With\r\nregard to the two former points, personal idiosyncrasy, and degree of or\r\npeculiarity in the nature of the injury, are the only explanations I can\r\nsuggest. Perhaps in some instances exposure to wet or cold in the early\r\nstages of the injury was of some import. Thus, I saw several severe\r\ncases of musculo-spiral neuritis in men who were wounded during the\r\ntrying and wet march on Bloemfontein. I did not observe that suppuration\r\nor wound complications seemed important explanatory moments, as most of\r\nthe cases occurred in wounds that healed rapidly.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question of selection; the same nerves that appear\r\nparticularly liable to suffer from idiopathic inflammations, toxic\r\ninfluences, or to be the seat of ascending changes (e.g. ulnar,\r\nmusculo-spiral, and external popliteal), were those most often affected\r\nby secondary neuritis. Many of the most severe cases I saw were in the\r\nmusculo-spiral nerve.\r\n\r\n_Scar implication._--The signs of this most commonly commenced with\r\nneuralgia, or painful sensations when such movements were made as to put\r\nthe cicatrix on the stretch. Although such neuralgia might not be\r\nconstant, it was often observed to be troublesome when the patients were\r\nexposed to cold in sleeping out at night, or to extra fatigue, as in\r\nlong marches. The results in many cases stopped at this point, but the\r\nsize and wide distribution of certain nerves rendered even such slight\r\nsymptoms of importance; while in others well-marked signs of neuritis\r\ndeclared themselves, such as glossy skin, pain, muscular wasting, and\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\n_Ascending neuritis._--In a few cases I observed very remarkable\r\ninstances of ascending neuritis, after comparatively slight wounds. I\r\nwill quote three of these as illustrations and make no further remarks\r\nas to the symptoms. It will be observed that one is a case of ulnar,\r\nboth the others of external popliteal, neuritis:--\r\n\r\n     (108) _Ulnar nerve: secondary ascending neuritis._--Boer\r\n     wounded at Elandslaagte. Wound of hand, implicating anterior\r\n     two-thirds of third metacarpal bone. This bone, together with\r\n     the middle finger, was removed, and healing took place by\r\n     granulation slowly.\r\n\r\n     The resulting gap allowed considerable overlapping of the\r\n     fingers, and shortening of the corresponding digit; the index\r\n     finger also became flexed as a result of destruction of the\r\n     extensor tendons. Three months later the man was still in\r\n     hospital in consequence of the tardiness with which the wound\r\n     had healed: at this time pain was noted, which became very\r\n     severe in the whole course of the ulnar nerve; superficial\r\n     hyperaesthesia and deep muscular tenderness developed, but no\r\n     wasting. Several crops of herpetic vesicles also developed over\r\n     the distribution of the radial nerve in the hand. This pain was\r\n     followed by spastic contracture, first of the ulnar fingers and\r\n     later of the wrist and elbow, which could only be straightened\r\n     by the application of considerable force. The limb was,\r\n     therefore, kept straight by the application of a splint; and\r\n     warm baths, and a blister applied over the course of the ulnar\r\n     nerve, were resorted to: under this treatment the condition\r\n     improved until the patient was well enough to be transferred as\r\n     a prisoner, and I saw him no more.\r\n\r\n     (109) _Peroneal nerve branches._--Wounded at Colenso. _Entry_,\r\n     at the anterior margin of the fibula 5 inches above the\r\n     external malleolus; the track crossed the anterior aspect of\r\n     the leg obliquely, to its _exit_ 1 inch above the centre of the\r\n     ankle joint. Incomplete paralysis of the peronei muscles\r\n     followed, combined with progressive wasting of the whole limb,\r\n     which at the end of a month was marked, and then commenced to\r\n     improve.\r\n\r\n     (110) In a second case the wound took a similar course in the\r\n     centre of the leg, crossing the line of the branches of the\r\n     musculo-cutaneous nerve. Motor paralysis of the peronei\r\n     followed, together with general lowering of tactile sensation\r\n     in the musculo-cutaneous area.\r\n\r\n_Traumatic neurosis._--In connection with the cases just quoted, mention\r\nmust be made of the fact that the functional element was often somewhat\r\nprominent. The influence of this factor was not to be neglected in case\r\n108; again, its presence was a feature in cases 132 and 134, of injury\r\nto the sciatic nerve and of peripheral injury to the seventh nerve (p.\r\n355). A remark has been made as to the occurrence of functional\r\nparaplegia on p. 337. Again, in the case of the organs of special sense.\r\nCase 66, of injury to the occipital lobes, showed that a mixture of\r\norganic and functional phenomena might be a source of error, even in the\r\ndetermination of the visual field in the subject of an undoubted\r\ndestructive lesion. On more than one occasion an injury was accompanied\r\nby loss of the power of speech; thus a patient who received a slight\r\nwound of the neck did not speak again until the application of a battery\r\nby my colleague, Mr. H. B. Robinson. A patient was also for a short time\r\nan inmate of No. 1 General Hospital, Wynberg, who had become deaf and\r\ndumb as a result of the explosion of a shrapnel shell over his head.\r\nThis patient also did not recover his powers until he returned to the\r\nmother-country.\r\n\r\nIn many other cases of nerve concussion or contusion, the recovery of\r\npower and sensation, or the disappearance of neuralgia or contractures,\r\nwas so sudden and rapid after prolonged continuance of the symptoms, as\r\nto suggest a very strong functional element in their origin. The\r\ninfluence of the general shock to the nervous system received by the\r\npatients had an important bearing on these phenomena, and their interest\r\nfrom a prognostic point of view was very great.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO SPECIAL NERVES\r\n\r\n_Cranial nerves._--It will be convenient first to make a few remarks\r\nconcerning the nerves of special sense.\r\n\r\n_Olfactory._--I observed temporary loss of smell on three occasions. In\r\ntwo instances this accompanied transverse wounds of the bones of the\r\nface in which the upper third of the nasal cavities was crossed; in the\r\nthird a track passing obliquely downwards from the frontal region passed\r\nthrough the inner wall of the orbit, and crossed the nose at a lower\r\nlevel. In view of the small area of the olfactory distribution which was\r\ndirectly implicated, I was at first inclined to regard the loss of smell\r\nas dependent on the presence of dried blood on the surface of the mucous\r\nmembrane, or on obstruction of the cavities from the same cause. Further\r\nobservation, however, appeared to show that it was due to concussion of\r\nthe branches of the olfactory nerve, since the loss of function\r\npersisted when the cavities were manifestly clear.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases we were confronted with the same difficulty which was\r\nexperienced both in lesions of sight and hearing, the determination as\r\nto whether the concussion was of the branches or of the olfactory bulb.\r\nWhen the symptom was the accompaniment of a fracture of the roof of the\r\norbit, the possibility of concussion of the olfactory lobe was manifest.\r\nIn all, again, it was difficult to say what part the accompanying\r\nconcussion of the branches of the fifth nerve took in the production of\r\nthe symptom. In all three cases mentioned the return of function was\r\ngradual, but apparently fairly complete at the end of three weeks. In\r\none it was noted that at first the patient was conscious of an odour\r\nbefore he was able to discriminate its actual nature; later he could\r\ndetermine the latter readily.\r\n\r\n_Optic._--Some remarks concerning lesions of the optic nerve have\r\nalready been made under the heading of wounds of the orbit. Concussion\r\nand contusion of the nerve both occurred, but I was unable to\r\ndifferentiate between the effects of these on the nerve itself, apart\r\nfrom the effects on the globe of the eye, which usually accompanied\r\nwounds of the orbit.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the nerve was directly divided in orbital wounds, and\r\neither pressure on or division of the nerve in the intra-cranial portion\r\nof its course, or as it traversed the optic foramen, was not uncommon.\r\n\r\n_Auditory._--Loss of hearing was also not infrequent; thus it\r\naccompanied all three wounds of the mastoid process quoted under the\r\nheading of the seventh nerve, also two cases of fracture of the\r\noccipital bone near the ear quoted on p. 278. In all these instances it\r\nwas impossible to attribute the deafness to lesion of the nerve alone,\r\nas the causative injury equally affected the internal ear, and in at\r\nleast two the bullet implicated the tympanum as well in its course. The\r\ndeafness was absolute in each case, and in none had any improvement\r\noccurred at the end of nine months. Deafness was a symptom in a certain\r\nnumber of the more severe cerebral injuries in which the course of the\r\nbullet was not so near to the internal ear: probably some of these were\r\ncentral in origin.\r\n\r\nI only once observed any interference with the sense of taste.\r\n\r\n_Remaining cranial nerves._--I have little to say regarding the _third_,\r\n_fourth_, and _sixth_ nerves. In the case of the third nerve, ptosis was\r\noccasionally seen in wounds of the skull involving the roof of the\r\norbit, but the relative parts taken by injury to nerve and laceration or\r\nfixation of muscle respectively, were usually hard to determine. Again,\r\nthe fourth and sixth nerves may have been damaged in some of the more\r\nextensive orbital wounds, especially those in which the globe suffered\r\ninjury, but the signs under such circumstances were difficult to\r\ndiscriminate, and the injury was of slight practical importance, in view\r\nof the major injury to the globe itself.\r\n\r\n_Fifth nerve._--Concussion, contusion, or laceration of the different\r\nbranches of the three divisions of the fifth nerve were common in wounds\r\nof the head, but most frequent in fractures of the upper or lower jaws.\r\nLocalised anaesthesia was common from one or other of these causes, but\r\nfor the most part transitory in the cases of contusion or concussion. I\r\nsaw no case of entire loss of function in any one division, symptoms\r\nbeing mostly confined to certain branches, as the supra-orbital, the\r\ntemporo-malar, the dental branches of the second division, the\r\nauriculo-temporal nerve, and the lingual, dental, and mental branches of\r\nthe third division. I did not observe any cases in which modification of\r\nthe special senses accompanied these injuries beyond those mentioned in\r\nthe remarks already made on the subject of anosmia, and one case in\r\nwhich some modification of the sense of taste accompanied an injury to\r\nthe floor of the mouth. It was a matter of surprise, considering the\r\nfrequency with which subsequent neuritis was met with in the nerves\r\ngenerally, that trifacial neuralgia in some form was not more often met\r\nwith. I never observed any serious case. Perhaps this is one of the\r\nfields in which a longer after-period may increase our knowledge.\r\nLastly, I never observed motor paralysis in the case of the third\r\ndivision, although sensory symptoms in some of the branches were common,\r\nevident proof that injuries to the trunk were rare.\r\n\r\n_Seventh nerve._--Facial paralysis was most commonly observed in cases\r\nof wound of the mastoid process, apart from central cortical facial\r\nparalyses, of which several are quoted in the chapter on injuries of the\r\nhead. All the wounds of the mastoid process were, in addition,\r\naccompanied by absolute deafness. I am sorry to be unable to give any\r\ndetails as to the electrical condition of the muscles in these cases,\r\nbut I believe that in the great majority the paralysis was mainly the\r\nresult of nerve concussion, since the perforations were clean in\r\ncharacter and not obviously accompanied by comminution. Pressure from\r\nhaemorrhage into the Fallopian canal may, of course, have been present,\r\nand in some instances, particularly those in which the bullet traversed\r\nthe tympanic cavity, spicules of bone may have caused laceration. In\r\nevery case, however, all the branches were equally affected; the\r\nparalysis was absolute, and in none did any improvement occur while the\r\ncases were under my observation.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few illustrative examples:--\r\n\r\n     (111) Boer wounded at Belmont. _Entry_, immediately above\r\n     zygoma; the bullet passed through the temporal fossa, fractured\r\n     the neck of the mandible, traversed the mastoid process, and\r\n     emerged at the lower margin of the hairy scalp, 1 inch from the\r\n     median line. Facial paralysis was complete, and there was no\r\n     improvement at the end of ten weeks.\r\n\r\n     (112) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_, at the posterior\r\n     border of the left mastoid process, 1/2 an inch above the tip;\r\n     _exit_, through the right upper lip at the junction of the\r\n     middle and outer thirds. There was considerable haemorrhage from\r\n     the left ear. The injury was followed by complete deafness, and\r\n     facial paralysis, which showed no sign of improvement.\r\n\r\n     There was complete anaesthesia over the area of distribution of\r\n     the third division of the fifth nerve; this improved rapidly,\r\n     and at the end of five weeks was hardly to be detected; neither\r\n     at that time could any impairment of power on the part of the\r\n     muscles of mastication be detected. No impairment of the sense\r\n     of taste was noted.\r\n\r\n     (113) _Entry_, above the anterior extremity of the zygoma,\r\n     bullet retained. Primary haemorrhage from ear. Complete facial\r\n     paralysis and deafness. Anaesthesia over distribution of\r\n     temporal branch of temporo-malar nerve, part of supra-orbital\r\n     area, auriculo-temporal nerve, and small occipital cervical\r\n     nerve. The muscles of mastication acted well. Ecchymosis below\r\n     the right mastoid process.\r\n\r\n     (114) Wounded at Paardeberg. 300 yards. _Entry_, at the\r\n     posterior border of the right mastoid process, 3/4 of an inch\r\n     above the tip; _exit_, the inner third of the left upper\r\n     eyelid. (Eye destroyed.) Complete right facial paralysis; deaf,\r\n     on right side cannot hear tick of watch either held close or in\r\n     contact. Purulent otitis media.\r\n\r\nIn this place I might mention two other cases of lesion of the seventh\r\nnerve secondary to wound of peripheral branches. In one a patient was\r\nstruck by several fragments of lead from a bullet which broke up against\r\na neighbouring stone. These for the most part lodged in the skin over\r\nthe left orbicularis muscle, but one also lodged in the conjunctiva and\r\nwas removed. Some ten days later the patient complained that he could\r\nnot lift the upper lid. The levator palpebrae was normal, but spasm of\r\nthe orbicularis held the eye firmly closed. The condition did not\r\nimprove, and the patient was invalided home. He recovered later.\r\n\r\nIn another patient a bullet entered above the right zygoma and traversed\r\nthe orbits, without wounding the globes. At the time no want of power of\r\nthe muscles of the face was noted, but a year later there was evident\r\nweakness of the whole of the muscles of the right side of the face, with\r\nloss of symmetry.\r\n\r\nIn the former case the functional element was strong, but in both an\r\nascending neuritis was probably present.\r\n\r\n_Tenth nerve._--The pneumogastric was implicated in many wounds of the\r\nneck. I never observed an uncomplicated case, but laryngeal paralysis\r\nwas temporarily present in two of the cases of cervical aneurism in\r\nwhich the wound crossed above the level of origin of the recurrent\r\nlaryngeal branch, while in two others the recurrent branch itself was in\r\nclose contact with the wall of the aneurism (p. 135). In all such cases\r\nsigns of concussion or contusion of the nerve would be expected, judging\r\nfrom the similar results observed in the brachial nerves when the\r\nneighbouring artery was implicated. The only obvious symptoms occurring,\r\nhowever, were laryngeal paralysis and acceleration of the pulse. As the\r\nlatter symptom was often observed in the cases of arterio-venous\r\ncommunication, wherever situated, and as the sympathetic nerve also lay\r\nin close contiguity to the wound track, it was difficult to ascribe it\r\nwith certainty solely to the vagus lesion. In the two cases of high\r\nvagus injury the laryngeal paralysis steadily improved, and at the end\r\nof six months was apparently well; in the two others it persisted at the\r\nend of three months and a year respectively.\r\n\r\nThe nerve must have been very frequently damaged in wounds of the neck;\r\nit is possible that this injury may have been an important factor in the\r\ndeath of some of the patients with cervical wounds upon the field.\r\n\r\n_Eleventh nerve._--I append the only case of localised spinal accessory\r\nparalysis I observed. This was one of my earliest experiences, and when\r\nI examined the neck, in the Field hospital, I assumed from the\r\ncompleteness of the sterno-mastoid and trapezius paralysis that the\r\nnerve was severed. The patient, however, made such a rapid recovery\r\nthat it became evident that the nerve had been contused only, and that\r\nthe recovery of function was not due, as is so often the case, to\r\nvicarious compensation by the cervical supply to the muscles.\r\n\r\n     (115) _Entry_, immediately to the right of the fourth cervical\r\n     spinous process; _exit_, at the anterior border of the left\r\n     sterno-mastoid opposite the angle of the mandible. The left\r\n     shoulder was depressed, the head inclined to the injured side.\r\n     There was evident spinal accessory paralysis, and marked\r\n     hyperaesthesia of the whole left upper extremity, most severe in\r\n     the circumflex area. The hyperaesthesia gradually disappeared in\r\n     a few days, and was clearly due to concussion and possibly\r\n     slight contusion of the cervical nerve roots. The spinal\r\n     accessory paralysis improved, so that the patient returned to\r\n     the front at the end of a month: when I saw him some four\r\n     months later the shoulders were held quite symmetrically.\r\n\r\nThe _twelfth nerve_ was occasionally damaged in wounds of the floor of\r\nthe mouth. I saw no case of permanent paralysis.\r\n\r\n_Injury to the systemic nerves._ _Cervical plexus._--Evidence of injury\r\nto the superficial branches of the cervical plexus was not rare; thus I\r\nsaw cases of small occipital anaesthesia, and great occipital neuralgia,\r\nbut none of motor paralysis from injury to the deeper muscular branches.\r\nI take it that the smallness of the branches, and the multiple supply\r\npossessed by many of the muscles of the neck, would both take part in\r\nrendering certain evidence of the injury of an individual motor nerve\r\nrare.\r\n\r\n_Brachial plexus._--Injury to this plexus in the neck was common; the\r\nmain peculiarity observed was the partial nature of the damage\r\ninflicted.\r\n\r\nThus injury to a single nerve, or to a complex of two or more, was far\r\nmore common than one implicating the whole plexus. Again, while complete\r\nparalysis might affect one set of nerves, another might simply exhibit\r\nsigns of irritation in the form of hyperaesthesia or pain.\r\n\r\nThe wounds producing these injuries varied much in direction; thus some\r\ncrossed the neck transversely, some were obliquely transverse, while\r\nothers took a more or less vertical course.\r\n\r\nThese same remarks hold good in the case of the nerves of the arm. In\r\nthe upper half, especially, complex injury was not rare, while in the\r\nlower third affection of individual nerves was more common. Another\r\nimportant difference must be mentioned in regard to the upper and lower\r\nsegments of the course of the brachial nerves; they are not only more\r\nwidely distributed below, but also more fixed in position, a fact\r\nantagonistic to the escape of the nerve by displacement and liable to\r\nexpose it to more severe contusion.\r\n\r\nThe latter point holds good in the forearm also; here, individual\r\ninjuries often occurred.\r\n\r\nWhile at work in the Field hospital alone I gained the impression that\r\nthe musculo-spiral nerve would not retain the unenviable character of\r\nbeing the most vulnerable nerve of the upper extremity, since the\r\nchances of each individual nerve seemed about equal, putting the\r\nquestion of the long course of the musculo-spiral nerve against the\r\nhumerus out of question. This expectation was, however, not confirmed,\r\nsince the musculo-spiral itself, if not primarily affected, was so often\r\nthe seat of secondary mischief in fractures of the humerus. The\r\nposterior interosseous branch seemed to exhibit a similar vulnerability\r\nto slight injuries, to be referred to later under the external popliteal\r\nof the lower extremity. Again, in complex injuries of the brachial\r\nplexus, or nerve trunks, the musculo-spiral branch rarely escaped being\r\na member, if not individually singled out.\r\n\r\nOf the _thoracic nerves_ I have little to say. They must have been often\r\ninjured in the thoracic wounds, yet, as far as my experience went,\r\nintercostal neuralgia was uncommon, or at any rate not a special\r\nfeature. One observation of interest, however, does exist; in the cases\r\nin which the ribs were fractured by bullets travelling across them\r\nwithin the thorax, pain was distinctly a prominent feature. This was no\r\ndoubt referable to the facts that in such instances the intercostal\r\nnerves were especially liable to direct injury, and that this was often\r\nmultiple. On one occasion a crop of herpetic vesicles developed along\r\nthe course of a dorsal nerve in an injury implicating a single\r\nintercostal space posteriorly.\r\n\r\n_Lumbar plexus._--Although not quite so well arranged to escape bullet\r\nwounds as the thoracic nerves, the lumbar, by reason of their deep\r\nposition and the comparatively wide area they cover, together with the\r\nrarity of wounds taking a sufficiently longitudinal direction to cross\r\nthe course of more than one or two branches, were also comparatively\r\nrarely damaged. I never saw an uncomplicated case of anterior crural\r\nparalysis, and rarely cruralgia. I think this is to be explained in two\r\nways: first, that the trunk course of the nerve is short; secondly, that\r\nit lies in the inguinal fossa. The second fact is of importance, since\r\nwounds in this region were in my experience responsible for a\r\nconsiderable percentage of the deaths on the field or shortly\r\nafterwards. Such deaths probably occurred from internal haemorrhage from\r\nthe iliac arteries, and it was in such cases that the anterior crural\r\nnerve stood in greatest danger of injury. I also never saw a case of\r\nlocalised obturator paralysis. On the other hand, anaesthesia or\r\nhyperaesthesia in the area of distribution of the lumbar nerves in the\r\ngroin, the external cutaneous and the long saphenous in the thigh, were\r\nnot uncommon. Hyperaesthesia developed in more than one case in which\r\ninjury to the psoas had led to haemorrhage into the muscle sheath.\r\n\r\n_Sacral plexus._--The sacral plexus is far more liable to extensive\r\ndirect injury than either of the two preceding. Its cords are larger,\r\ngathered up into a much smaller space, and more liable to injury, from\r\nthe fact that the slope in which they lie is more readily followed by a\r\nbullet track. Again, the cords rest for a considerable portion of their\r\ncourse on a bony bed, a particularly dangerous position in gunshot\r\nwounds, since the nerves are not only exposed to the danger of direct\r\nwound, or pressure from bony spicules, but also readily receive\r\ntransmitted vibrations secondary to impact of the bullet with the bone.\r\n\r\nNone the less I had few occasions to observe extensive injuries of the\r\nplexus. In one instance damage particularly affecting the lumbo-sacral\r\ncord occurred, but this was complicated by signs of irritation of the\r\nanterior crural and obturator nerves, as the result of retro-peritoneal\r\nhaemorrhage and injury to the psoas muscle. Two cases in which the\r\nsacro-coccygeal plexus suffered isolated injury on account of their\r\ncharacteristic nature as gunshot injuries will be shortly quoted:\r\n\r\n     (116) _Sacro-coccygeal plexus._--_Entry_, at the junction of\r\n     the middle and posterior thirds of the left iliac crest; the\r\n     bullet passed obliquely downwards through the pelvis to lodge 3\r\n     inches below the right trochanter major. Incontinence of soft\r\n     faeces persisted for five weeks, and retention of urine during\r\n     three weeks.\r\n\r\n     This patient subsequently died on the homeward voyage, but I am\r\n     unable to say from what cause.\r\n\r\n     (117) _Entry_, over third sacral vertebra; _exit_, 2 inches\r\n     from the median line, and 1-1/2 inch above Poupart's ligament\r\n     on the anterior abdominal wall. Incontinence, with involuntary\r\n     passage of faeces, persisted during the first twenty-four hours,\r\n     and for two days the urine had to be withdrawn with a catheter.\r\n     No further signs of nerve injury were noted.\r\n\r\nThe same explanation of the comparative rarity of injuries to the sacral\r\nplexus that has been already given in the case of the anterior crural\r\nnerve holds good--viz. that in a great many of the pelvic wounds\r\ninvolving the plexus early death followed from the severity of the\r\nconcurrent injuries.\r\n\r\nInjuries to the great sciatic nerve outside the pelvis, or to one of its\r\nconstituent elements, on the other hand, formed one of the most familiar\r\nof the nerve lesions. The wounds giving rise to these were of the most\r\ndiverse character; some crossed the buttock in a vertical, transverse,\r\nor oblique direction; others travelled through the thigh in\r\ncorresponding directions, while a third series involved both buttock and\r\nthigh.\r\n\r\nThe size of the great sciatic nerve renders complete laceration by a\r\nbullet of small calibre a matter almost of impossibility; hence complete\r\ndivision may almost be left out of consideration in the case of this\r\nnerve. On the other hand, partial division, perforation, and severe\r\ncontusion are each and all favoured by the same factor.\r\n\r\nWith an extended thigh the nerve is in a state of comparatively slight\r\ntension, and this may be still lessened if the knee be flexed. This\r\nfactor, together with the density of the sheath of the nerve, favours\r\nthe possibility of displacement, and this occurrence is more likely in\r\nthe lower segment than in the upper, which is comparatively fixed in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nClinical experience appeared to illustrate the importance of these\r\nanatomical factors, as the worst cases of sciatic injury that I saw were\r\nin connection with wounds of the buttock or the junction of that segment\r\nof the trunk with the thigh.\r\n\r\nThe most striking observation with regard to the injuries of the great\r\nsciatic nerve was the comparatively frequent escape of the popliteal\r\nelement and the severe lesion of the peroneal. This was so pronounced as\r\nto amount to as high a proportion of peroneal symptoms as 90 per cent.,\r\nand often when the whole nerve was implicated the popliteal signs were\r\nof the irritative, the peroneal of the paralytic type. When bullets\r\ncrossed the popliteal space, given wounds of equal severity in\r\ncorresponding degrees of contiguity to the respective nerves, the\r\nperoneal element always suffered in greater degree. Again, the peroneal\r\nnerve symptoms were more obstinate and prolonged, and instances of\r\nascending neuritis were more common than in the case of any other nerve\r\nof the lower extremity, and the trophic wasting of muscles was more\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\nThe peroneal nerve, therefore, acquires the same unenviable degree of\r\nimportance in the lower extremity enjoyed by the musculo-spiral in the\r\nupper. Here, again, we are confronted with the fact that the peroneal\r\nelement of the great sciatic nerve is the more prone to idiopathic\r\ninflammations or toxic influences, and hence we can only assume it to\r\npossess a special vulnerability. The peroneal element is of course\r\nsomewhat the more exposed, as lying posterior; but it seems unreasonable\r\nto assume that so large a proportion of the injuries can implicate the\r\nposterior segment of the nerve as to make the startling difference in\r\nthe incidence of degeneration explicable. In this relation we may bear\r\nin mind that the muscles supplied by this nerve suffer most in the\r\ndegeneration subsequent to anterior polio-myelitis, and again that in\r\ncerebral hemiplegia or spinal-cord injuries they are the last to\r\nrecover. Unfortunately no explanation of these remarkable facts, so\r\nforcibly impressed by the large series of cases with peroneal symptoms\r\nseen in a short time, is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nI may dismiss the other branches of the sacral plexus in a few words.\r\nThe small sciatic was occasionally injured in its course in the buttock,\r\nand the small saphenous in the leg. When either element of the latter\r\nwas injured, it was surprising how sharply the imperfections in the\r\nanaesthesia corresponded with the composite character of the nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASES OF NERVE INJURY\r\n\r\nThe following cases are added mainly to give some idea of the\r\ncomparative frequency with which the individual nerves were injured, and\r\nalso to exemplify the more common forms of complex injury met with.\r\nCircumstances, unfortunately, did not always allow of extended\r\nobservation at the time, and I have not been very fortunate in my\r\nattempts to obtain subsequent information on this series since my\r\nreturn. A certain amount of prognostic information is, however,\r\nfurnished by some of the records, and I am very much indebted to my\r\ncolleague, Dr. Turney, for help in this matter.\r\n\r\n     (118) _Brachial plexus._--_Entry_, 2 inches above the clavicle\r\n     at the anterior margin of the trapezius; _exit_, first\r\n     intercostal space, 1 inch from the sternal margin. Heavy dull\r\n     pain developed at once, extending down the upper extremity. A\r\n     fortnight later this pain still persisted; there was lowered\r\n     sensation in the ulnar area with formication, also lowered\r\n     sensation in the internal cutaneous area of distribution;\r\n     sensation in the lesser internal cutaneous area was normal. The\r\n     patient went home with the nerve symptoms well at the end of a\r\n     month.\r\n\r\n     (119) _Brachial plexus injury._--Wounded at Magersfontein.\r\n     _Entry_, at the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid opposite\r\n     the pomum Adami; _exit_, through the ninth rib below and 1/2 an\r\n     inch external to the scapular angle. Emphysema and considerable\r\n     blood extravasation developed in the posterior triangle of the\r\n     neck, also loss of power in the musculo-spiral distribution,\r\n     but no anaesthesia. At the end of the first fortnight there was\r\n     evident wasting of the muscles, but some power was returning in\r\n     the triceps. At the end of a month the man left for England,\r\n     with fair power in the triceps, but well-marked wrist-drop. A\r\n     year later the wrist-drop still persisted.\r\n\r\n     (120) _Plexus injury._--Wound of _entry_, over pomum Adami;\r\n     _exit_, below scapular spine, about centre. Complete median and\r\n     musculo-spiral paralysis.\r\n\r\n     (121) _Median, musculo-cutaneous, and musculo-spiral\r\n     nerves._--The wound traversed the axilla from just beneath the\r\n     anterior fold; three weeks later a firm mass in the axilla\r\n     corresponded to the wound track. Hyperaesthesia developed in the\r\n     area of median distribution, with deep pain in the muscles.\r\n     There was rigidity of the biceps cubiti and slight wasting in\r\n     the radial extensors. The patient improved slowly, and\r\n     eventually was discharged and passed out of sight.\r\n\r\n     (122) _Brachial nerves._--Wounded at Paardeberg. Range 500\r\n     yards. _Entry_, at the front of the arm, 2 inches below the\r\n     junction of the anterior axillary fold; _exit_, a little lower,\r\n     at the back of the arm, in the line of junction of the\r\n     posterior axillary fold.\r\n\r\n     Considerable shock attended the primary injury; when reaction\r\n     had taken place, complete motor and sensory paralysis was noted\r\n     of the whole upper extremity, with the exception of some power\r\n     of movement of the posterior interosseous group of muscles.\r\n     Three weeks later the patient could extend the wrist, but\r\n     sensation was imperfect in the arm, and completely absent in\r\n     the forearm and hand. The track was now hard and palpable, but\r\n     there was no hyperaesthesia in any area; when the track was\r\n     manipulated slight formication in the hand was experienced. The\r\n     biceps and triceps were equally paralysed. There was no wasting\r\n     in any of the muscles.\r\n\r\n     (123) _Brachial nerves._--Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_,\r\n     through the anterior axillary fold at its junction with the\r\n     arm; _exit_, on the posterior wall of the thorax, 1/2 an inch\r\n     from the median line at a level with the angle of the scapula.\r\n     Complete musculo-spiral paralysis; haemothorax. Three weeks\r\n     later, radial sensation returned; but the triceps was very\r\n     weak, and wrist-drop was complete. There was some wasting of\r\n     the muscles supplied by the median and ulnar nerves, and\r\n     complete obliteration of the radial pulse. A year later the\r\n     musculo-spiral paralysis still persisted.\r\n\r\n     (124) _Musculo-spiral and median._--Wounded at Magersfontein.\r\n     _Entry_, 3 inches below the anterior axillary fold, on the\r\n     inner aspect of the arm; track passed obliquely downwards\r\n     behind the humerus to a point on the outer aspect of the arm\r\n     1-1/2 inch below the level of the entry. The humerus escaped\r\n     injury. Musculo-spiral paralysis was complete; hyperaesthesia in\r\n     the distribution of the median followed some days later. One\r\n     month subsequently radial sensation had returned, and a feeling\r\n     of numbness had taken the place of the median hyperaesthesia.\r\n     The triceps and marginal muscles were much wasted, and only\r\n     interosseous extension was possible in the fingers.\r\n\r\n     (125) _Brachial nerves._--Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ and\r\n     _exit_, in the upper third of the arm internal to the humerus.\r\n     Complete median paralysis, anaesthesia in the ulnar area, and in\r\n     the radial supply to the dorsum of the middle and ring fingers.\r\n     Could flex, extend, and adduct and abduct the wrist; some power\r\n     of flexion in index finger, in others none. The flexion of the\r\n     wrist was dependent on the ulnar supply to the muscles of the\r\n     forearm. No wasting of the interossei, skin normal except for a\r\n     large trophic blister on the dorsum of the hand. Little\r\n     improvement had taken place in this patient at the end of a\r\n     year.\r\n\r\n     (126) _Brachial nerves._--Wounded at Magersfontein. The wound\r\n     traversed the lower part of the upper third of the arm,\r\n     fracturing the humerus. Immediate complete loss of power in the\r\n     arm was experienced, together with loss of all sensation. Three\r\n     weeks later the humerus was united; the fracture was evidently\r\n     the result of passing contact, and not of direct impact. The\r\n     paralysis was still complete in the distribution of the median,\r\n     ulnar, and musculo-spiral nerves. There was considerable\r\n     wasting of the hand and forearm, and a good deal of thickening\r\n     in the lower third of the arm.\r\n\r\n     Four months after the original injury, the nerves were explored\r\n     by Mr. Eve, who kindly gives me the following information. All\r\n     the nerves and vessels of the arm were united into one firm\r\n     bundle by cicatricial tissue. When dissected clear, the median\r\n     nerve was found to be thickened and enlarged for about 1-1/2\r\n     inch of its length; the ulnar was not completely freed, but was\r\n     found to be continuous and indurated; the musculo-spiral was\r\n     also intact, but at its entrance into the humeral groove a mass\r\n     of callus was felt. A sclerosed and thickened portion of the\r\n     median nerve 3-1/2 inches in length was resected, also 1 inch\r\n     of sclerosed ulnar nerve, and both were sutured. The\r\n     musculo-spiral nerve was left for future exploration. A small\r\n     traumatic aneurism was found on the brachial artery, and the\r\n     vessel was ligatured above it.\r\n\r\n     Ten months later no improvement in the median or ulnar nerves.\r\n     Electrical reaction present in musculo-spiral group of\r\n     muscles.\r\n\r\n     (127) _Musculo-spiral._--Transverse wound through arm posterior\r\n     to humerus. Slight suppuration. Triceps weakened only, complete\r\n     paralysis of radial extensors and posterior interosseous group.\r\n     Radial sensation lowered only.\r\n\r\n     (128) _Musculo-spiral._--_Entry_, 2 inches above and 1/2 an\r\n     inch behind the external humeral condyle; _exit_, at the inner\r\n     edge of the biceps, 1/2 an inch lower in the arm than the\r\n     entry. It is doubtful whether the paralysis was noted at first,\r\n     but a few days later complete posterior interosseous paralysis\r\n     and lowered radial sensation were remarked. No change except a\r\n     deepening of the anaesthesia, and the development of formication\r\n     on manipulation of the wound occurred, and at the end of three\r\n     weeks the nerve was exposed (Mr. Watson), and it was found that\r\n     a notch had been cut in its outer border, which had opened out\r\n     into a V shape. The margins of this notch were refreshed and\r\n     the gap closed. Ten days later radial sensation was fairly\r\n     good, but the motor symptoms remained unchanged. Nine months\r\n     later steady but very slow improvement was reported.\r\n\r\n     (129) _Ulnar and musculo-cutaneous nerves._--_Entry_, back of\r\n     forearm; the bullet passed between the bones and was retained\r\n     at the posterior aspect of the arm. Three weeks later the hand\r\n     was glossy and stiff, the fingers extended and adducted, the\r\n     thumb was held stiffly in the palm with no power of extension.\r\n     The forearm was held semiprone, and the elbow flexed by a rigid\r\n     biceps. Six months later the same position was maintained, but\r\n     the contracture disappeared under an anaesthetic.\r\n\r\n     (130) _Median and posterior interosseous._--_Entry_, over the\r\n     external margin of the radius at the centre of the forearm;\r\n     _exit_, at the inner margin of the olecranon 1-1/2 inch below\r\n     the tip. Lowered cutaneous sensation in median distribution,\r\n     and loss of median flexion of wrist and fingers. Complete\r\n     wrist-drop. The triceps supinator longus and extensor carpi\r\n     radialis longior were perfect. Twelve days later the wrist\r\n     could be raised into a direct line with forearm, but there was\r\n     no change in the median symptoms. A week after this the\r\n     anaesthetic median area became hyperaesthetic both as to skin and\r\n     on deep pressure over the muscles.\r\n\r\n     (131) _Sacral plexus. Great sciatic nerve._--Wounded at Modder\r\n     River. _Entry_, in left loin; _exit_, at lower margin of\r\n     buttock. The wound was followed immediately by complete\r\n     peroneal paralysis, both motor and sensory. Fourteen days later\r\n     hyperaesthesia developed in the area of distribution of the\r\n     internal popliteal nerve, the superficial pain being greatest\r\n     in the sole; the muscles of the calf were also very tender on\r\n     manipulation. The pain increased, and at the end of twenty-four\r\n     days the patient's sufferings were so great that Mr. Thornton\r\n     cut down upon and exposed the nerve. It was found embedded in\r\n     firm cicatricial tissue close to the sciatic notch; this\r\n     compressed the nerve to such a degree that a waist was apparent\r\n     upon it.\r\n\r\n     The nerve was freed and resumed its normal outline. For a few\r\n     days the patient was much relieved, but the neuralgia then\r\n     returned in greater intensity than ever. Morphia was injected\r\n     hypodermically, and other hypnotics employed, but with little\r\n     effect, the patient developing the hysterical condition so\r\n     common in the subjects of severe sciatica. Some five weeks\r\n     later a sudden improvement took place, the morphia was\r\n     decreased, and the patient became sufficiently well to return\r\n     to England, but there was still deep tenderness in the calf,\r\n     and well-marked hyperaesthesia of the sole.\r\n\r\n     A year later the patient had been discharged from the Service,\r\n     but was earning his living in a shop. He walked fairly well,\r\n     but still with foot-drop, and complained of tenderness in the\r\n     sole. I am indebted to Dr. Turney for the following report on\r\n     the condition of the muscles.\r\n\r\n     Calf muscles practically normal. In the anterior tibial and\r\n     peroneal groups the faradic irritability is much diminished,\r\n     that in the peroneus longus being the lowest of all.\r\n     Contraction can be induced in the extensor longus hallucis,\r\n     extensor longus digitorum, and peroneus brevis; but reaction is\r\n     doubtful in the case of the tibialis anticus and peroneus\r\n     longus.\r\n\r\n     With the galvanic current contraction is sluggish, and the\r\n     irritability diminished. No serious changes are present except\r\n     in the peroneus longus. ACC > KCC at 10 M. A.\r\n\r\n     (132) _Great sciatic._--_Entry_, at outer aspect of the thigh,\r\n     just above the centre; _exit_, at the junction of the inner and\r\n     posterior aspects of thigh, about 2 inches lower. The wound was\r\n     produced by a ricochet bullet, and beyond the perforation of\r\n     the sciatic nerve the femur was fractured obliquely (see plate\r\n     XVI.). Hyperaesthesia of the sole was noted early, and when I\r\n     saw the patient three months later, there was wasting of the\r\n     muscles of the leg, and foot-drop, although he walked with a\r\n     stick.\r\n\r\n     These symptoms persisted, and on his return to England an\r\n     exploration was made by Sir Thomas Smith, and the two fragments\r\n     of mantle seen in the skiagram were removed from the substance\r\n     of the sciatic nerve. Eight months after the injury, the\r\n     patient still walked with foot-drop; there was modified\r\n     sensation in the musculo-cutaneous area, and a feeling as if\r\n     the bones of the foot were uncovered when he walked. The\r\n     circumference of the affected leg was more than 1 inch less\r\n     than that of the sound one. Steady but slow improvement was\r\n     taking place.\r\n\r\n     (133) _Great sciatic_.--In a third patient with a buttock\r\n     track, the symptoms were identical with those observed in case\r\n     131. In this an exploration showed that the nerve had been\r\n     perforated. Although the symptoms were never so severe as in\r\n     No. 131, yet recovery was very much slower and less complete,\r\n     the muscular weakness remained more marked, and the skin\r\n     exhibited more evidence of trophic lesion. Some contracture of\r\n     the knee and rigid foot-drop took place, and at the end of\r\n     twelve months the patient walked poorly with a stick.\r\n     Improvement is, however, continuing.\r\n\r\n     (134) _Great sciatic_.--Wounded at Ladysmith. _Entry_,\r\n     immediately below left buttock fold; _exit_, at anterior aspect\r\n     of thigh, 3-1/2 inches below Poupart's ligament. The left leg\r\n     was paralysed, and patient was sent down to the Base, where he\r\n     remained two months. The wound closed by primary union, the\r\n     paralysis improved, and the man rejoined his regiment. After he\r\n     had been in camp four days, his leg gave way, and he returned\r\n     to hospital, where he contracted enteric fever. Later, he was\r\n     sent home, and eight months after the reception of the injury\r\n     his condition was as follows:\r\n\r\n     Left lower limb somewhat wasted, a diminution of 1 inch in the\r\n     circumference of the leg and 1/2 an inch in the thigh being\r\n     found. The patient walks with foot-drop, and the flexor muscles\r\n     of the knee are weak. On examination the peroneal muscles\r\n     reacted but sluggishly to faradic irritation. There is complete\r\n     anaesthesia of the foot to above the ankle, and up to the knee\r\n     tactile sensation and appreciation of pain were dulled. The\r\n     left plantar reflex was absent, the right slight, the left\r\n     patellar reflex was abnormally brisk. There was neither ankle\r\n     nor patellar clonus, and the other reflexes were present and\r\n     normal. The gait was spastic, and the patient was more troubled\r\n     by a contraction of the calf muscles, which prevented his\r\n     putting the heel to the ground, than by the foot-drop.\r\n\r\n     Beyond these local phenomena there was marked tremor of the\r\n     upper extremities on any exertion, and slight lateral\r\n     nystagmus. The patient was not sure that this had not been\r\n     present ever since he recovered from the enteric fever, but it\r\n     was sufficiently marked to give rise to the suspicion of the\r\n     development of disseminated sclerosis.\r\n\r\n     The patient was a hard-headed, sensible man. He remained in the\r\n     hospital under the care of Dr. Turney, to whom I am indebted\r\n     for notes of the case, forty-six days. During this period he\r\n     was treated by faradic electricity, and, with some checks,\r\n     notably the development of passive effusion into the left\r\n     knee-joint, and a fugitive attack of redness over the dorsum of\r\n     the foot, both suggesting trophic changes, steadily improved.\r\n     The anaesthesia became limited to the outer half of the leg, at\r\n     the end of one month was limited to the dorsum of the foot\r\n     only, and at the end of six weeks entirely disappeared.\r\n     Meanwhile the tendency to drawing up of the heel by the calf\r\n     muscles became less, and the gait improved. The man left the\r\n     hospital at the end of two months, very satisfied with his\r\n     condition, although the tremor of the hands was still present\r\n     in a lessened degree.\r\n\r\n     (135) _External popliteal._--Wounded at Magersfontein, 250-300\r\n     yards. _Entry_, at the outer side of the thigh, 5 inches above\r\n     the lower extremity of the external condyle; _exit_, at the\r\n     inner margin of the adductors, at a level 4 inches higher in\r\n     the thigh. The track crossed behind the femur. Complete\r\n     peroneal motor paralysis and anaesthesia, except in the hinder\r\n     part of the region supplied by the mixed external saphenous.\r\n     Slight hyperaesthesia of the sole. Improving at the end of three\r\n     weeks, but paralysis still nearly complete.\r\n\r\n     (136) _External popliteal._--Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_,\r\n     5 inches below the highest part of the right iliac crest, on\r\n     outer aspect of hip; _exit_, at the posterior margin of the\r\n     gracilis, 2 inches from the perineum. Complete peroneal\r\n     paralysis followed, which rapidly improved, and on the\r\n     twenty-second day was nearly well.\r\n\r\n     (137) _Internal popliteal. Secondary anaesthesia_.--_Shell_\r\n     wounds of the right popliteal space. Wounded at Belmont.\r\n     Anaesthesia of the outer side of the calf, the leg and sole of\r\n     foot. No motor paralysis. As cicatrisation progressed, the\r\n     anaesthesia became more marked and was complete over the whole\r\n     of the external saphenous area.\r\n\r\n     (138) _Internal popliteal._--Wounded at Paardeberg. 400-500\r\n     yards. _Entry_, about the centre of the outer half of the\r\n     patella; _exit_, at the centre of the calf, about 2 inches from\r\n     the popliteal crease. Five days after the injury severe burning\r\n     pain developed in the sole. A fortnight later the pain was much\r\n     less severe, but varied in degree with the heat of the weather,\r\n     being worse when cool. At this date, however, rubbing became\r\n     comforting.\r\n\r\n     (139) _External popliteal._---Wounded at Magersfontein.\r\n     _Entry_, 1 inch above the upper end of the internal margin of\r\n     the patella; _exit_, at the margin of leg, just below the outer\r\n     tuberosity of the tibia. Complete peroneal paralysis followed\r\n     the injury. A month later the nerve was bared and found\r\n     slightly thickened. An improvement in cutaneous sensation\r\n     followed quickly, and a much slower improvement in the motor\r\n     power commenced.\r\n\r\n     (140) _External popliteal nerve._--Wounded at Beacon Hill. A\r\n     _bayonet_ entered over upper quarter of fibula, and passed\r\n     between the bones of leg into the calf. An aneurismal varix of\r\n     the calf vessels developed, also incomplete peroneal paralysis.\r\n     The scar was raised from the nerve (Major Simpson, R.A.M.C.)\r\n     six weeks later, and at the end of a fortnight the power and\r\n     sensation were both much improved and the patient returned to\r\n     England.\r\n\r\n     (141) _External popliteal._--Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_,\r\n     1/2 an inch above the internal border of the patella; _exit_,\r\n     1-1/2 inch from the head of the fibula and over that bone. The\r\n     wound was followed by peroneal paralysis. Six weeks later\r\n     sensation was still diminished in the anterior tibial and\r\n     musculo-cutaneous nerve areas, and marked foot-drop, little\r\n     improved, persisted. The patient came to England, and at the\r\n     end of twelve months is reported as very little improved.\r\n\r\n     (142) _Anterior tibial._--_Entry_, 1 inch in front and below\r\n     the external malleolus; _exit_, at the centre of the sole, just\r\n     anterior to the bases of the metatarsal bones. Wasting and\r\n     paralysis of extensor brevis digitorum.\r\n\r\n     (143) _Small sciatic and small saphenous._--Wounded at\r\n     Magersfontein. 200 yards. Two wounds: (i) _Entry_, below the\r\n     centre of the twelfth rib on the left side; _exit_, immediately\r\n     to the left of the buttock furrow at upper part, (ii) _Entry_,\r\n     in the right loin, midway between the last rib and iliac crest;\r\n     _exit_, just within the centre of the left buttock; the two\r\n     wounds crossed diagonally. Hyperaesthesia in area of\r\n     distribution of small saphenous and small sciatic nerves, which\r\n     rapidly improved.\r\n\r\n     (144) _Lumbar plexus._--Boer, wounded at Magersfontein.\r\n     _Entry_, eleventh interspace, posterior axillary line; _exit_,\r\n     tenth interspace, right mid-axillary line. Impaired sensation\r\n     in area of distribution of external cutaneous and crural branch\r\n     of genito-crural nerves. At the end of a fortnight anaesthesia\r\n     was less apparent, but a feeling of numbness persisted, which\r\n     soon disappeared.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis and treatment._--In considering the prognosis in cases of\r\nnerve injury, several of the points already raised as to the nature of\r\nthe lesion are of importance. Short of actual section, it may be broadly\r\nstated that no lesion is too serious to render ultimate recovery\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which the injury has been produced by a bullet fired at a\r\nshort range, or in which contact with the nerve has been close, the\r\nreturn of functional activity is very slow. In such instances the\r\ncondition probably resembles that in which a divided nerve has been\r\nsutured, with the additional disadvantage that a considerable portion of\r\nthe nerve, both above and below the point actually struck, has been\r\ndestroyed as far as the conduction of nervous impulses is concerned.\r\nThis may reasonably be concluded in the light of the evidence offered by\r\nthe injuries of the spinal cord, in which several segments usually\r\nsuffered if the velocity of the bullet was great, and also if the fact\r\nis remembered that, when thickening takes place, a considerable length\r\nof the nerve is usually implicated.\r\n\r\nRecovery is notably slow in the case of certain nerves, _e.g._\r\nmusculo-spiral and peroneal, even when the injury has not been of\r\nextreme severity. Again, these same nerves are apparently more seriously\r\naffected by moderate degrees of damage than are others.\r\n\r\nAs favourable prognostic elements we may bear in mind: low velocity on\r\nthe part of the travelling bullet, and with this a lesser degree of\r\ncontiguity of the track to the nerve. The early return of sensation is a\r\nfavourable sign, and in this relation the development of hyperaesthesia,\r\nwhether preceded by anaesthesia or no, points to the maintenance of\r\ncontinuity of, and a moderate degree of damage to, the nerve. The early\r\nreturn of sensation, even if modified in acuteness, was always a very\r\nhopeful sign; also the production of formication in the area of\r\ndistribution of the nerve on manipulation of the injured spot. As in the\r\ncase of nerve injuries of every nature, the disposition and temperament\r\nof the patient exerted considerable influence on the course of the\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nComplete section of the nerves in these bullet wounds only obtained\r\nspecial importance in two ways: first, in that a considerable portion of\r\nthe trunk might be shot away in oblique tracks, and, secondly, in that\r\nvery severe contusion might affect the nerve for a considerable\r\ndistance beyond the point actually implicated. In point of fact,\r\ncomplete section when treated by suture was often more rapidly recovered\r\nfrom than an injury in which only a portion of the width of a trunk was\r\ndivided. This was no doubt to be explained on the theory that the\r\ncontiguous portion of the nerve suffered less when tension and\r\nresistance were lessened by complete severance of the cord.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ of slight nerve contusion was simple; rest alone was\r\nnecessary, and in the course of hours or days paralysis was recovered\r\nfrom. The symptoms were most troublesome in patients of a neurotic\r\ntemperament, or those who had suffered from severe systemic shock.\r\n\r\nIn severe concussions and contusions the first care had to be devoted to\r\nthe discrimination of the lesion from that of division. A period of rest\r\nthen needed to be followed by one of massage and movement, to maintain\r\nthe nutrition of the muscles. In a considerable portion of the cases a\r\nstage of neuritis had to be expected. In all cases, either of severe\r\nconcussion, contusion, or complete section, accompanied by the fracture\r\nof a bone, especial care was necessary that the bandaging and fixation\r\nof the limb were not sufficiently tight to add the dangers of muscular\r\nischaemia to those of the nerve injury already present.\r\n\r\nNeuritis, whether dependent on local injury, implication in the scar,\r\npressure from callus, or of the ascending variety, needed the same\r\ntreatment: rest, preservation of the limb from cold or damp, and the\r\nlocal application of anodynes, as belladonna, or hot laudanum\r\nfomentations. In some cases a general anodyne, as morphia, was\r\npreferable; then always to be used with caution, as the patients soon\r\ncraved inordinately for it, and were unwilling to give it up. Later,\r\nlocal blisters in the line of the nerve trunk, careful massage and\r\nexercise when muscular and cutaneous tenderness had subsided, the\r\napplication of the continuous current to the nerves, and perhaps\r\nfaradisation of the muscles, were all useful.\r\n\r\nSplints were often temporarily required to resist contracture, or the\r\nassumption of false positions; in either case they needed to be\r\nfrequently removed, and movement &c. made, in order to avoid any chance\r\nof troublesome stiffness.\r\n\r\n_Operative treatment._--Early interference was only warranted by\r\npositive knowledge that some source of irritation or pressure could be\r\nremoved; thus a bone spicule, or a bullet, or part of one, particularly\r\nportions of mantles.\r\n\r\nIn case of contusion the expiration of three months is the earliest date\r\nat which any operation should be taken into consideration, and\r\ninterference is only then advisable if there is good prospect of freeing\r\nthe nerve from compressing adhesions. The two strongest indications for\r\noperation are (1) signs pointing to the secondary implication of the\r\nnerve in a cicatrix, especially when these are of such a nature as to\r\nindicate local tension, fixation, or pressure; (2) the possibility of\r\nthe irritation being the result of the presence of some foreign body,\r\nsuch as a bone spicule, or portions of a bullet mantle; in such cases\r\nthe X rays will often give useful help.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the early exploration of cases of traumatic neuralgia, it\r\nmay be pointed out that when this was undertaken the results were as a\r\nrule very temporary. In many cases in which the measure was resorted to,\r\neither no macroscopic evidence of injury to the nerve was discovered, or\r\na bulbous thickening was met with of such extent as to make excision\r\ninadvisable, even if it were considered otherwise the most suitable\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nEven when complete section of the nerve was assured by the absence of\r\nany power of reaction to stimulation by electricity from above on the\r\npart of the muscles, operation was better not undertaken until\r\ncicatrisation had reached a certain stage. If done earlier than at the\r\nend of three weeks, the sutured spot became implicated in a hard\r\ncicatrix, and any advantage to be obtained by early interference was\r\nlost. When partial division of a trunk was determined, the same date was\r\nthe most favourable one for exploration, the gap in the nerve being\r\nfreshened and closed by suture. There is little doubt, however, that in\r\nsome cases such injuries were recovered from spontaneously.\r\n\r\nIn view of the uniformly bad results observed in the case of the seventh\r\nnerve, I am inclined to think that the above rules might be tentatively\r\nrelaxed, and the nerve primarily explored by an operation resembling\r\nthat for mastoid suppuration. It is of course doubtful whether the\r\ntrouble does not generally result from the vibratory concussion alone;\r\nbut as this is not certain, and the operation would only have to be\r\nperformed on patients already permanently deaf, it might be worth while\r\nat any rate opening the Fallopian canal with the object of relieving\r\ntension. It is not probable that in any of the cases quoted much\r\nsplintering of the bone had occurred, as the wounds appeared to be of\r\nthe nature of pure perforations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE CHEST\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to Prognosis wounds of the chest furnished the most hopeful\r\nclass of the whole series of trunk or visceral injuries. Cases of wound\r\nof the heart and great vessels afforded the only exceptions to an almost\r\nuniversally favourable course, both as regards life and the\r\nnon-occurrence of serious after-effects.\r\n\r\nThis was mainly explicable on two grounds: first, the sharply localised\r\ncharacter of the lesion produced by the bullet of small calibre; and,\r\nsecondly, the fact that the lung, the most frequently injured organ, is\r\nnot materially affected by the grade of velocity with which the bullet\r\nstrikes. In point of fact, wounds of this organ probably afford an\r\ninstance in which high grades of velocity are distinctly favourable to\r\nthe nature of the injury, and this is possibly true in the case of\r\nwounds of the chest-wall also.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the calibre of the bullet in wounds of the chest is\r\nevident. The late Mr. Archibald Forbes, in one of his letters from the\r\nseat of the Franco-German war, remarked that in crossing a battlefield\r\nit was easy to recognise the patients who had suffered a wound of the\r\nlung from the fact that the whistle of the air entering and leaving the\r\nchest was plainly audible. This was, indeed, not uncommonly the case in\r\nwounds produced by the older bullets of large calibre, but with the\r\nemployment of the smaller projectile it has become an experience of the\r\npast. Some evidence as to the comparative severity of wounds produced by\r\nthe larger forms of bullet was, moreover, afforded by the present\r\ncampaign, since Martini-Henry wounds were occasionally met with. Of some\r\ninstances observed by myself, in one, external haemorrhage was a\r\nprominent symptom; in another, a piece of lung was prolapsed from a\r\nwound in the back, and twice I observed pneumothorax, an uncommon\r\nsequela to wounds from bullets of small calibre.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, however, that all these more serious injuries were\r\nrecovered from, also that when we consider that the patients were\r\ncomparatively young and healthy subjects, the favourable prognosis was\r\nwhat might have reasonably been expected. When, as occasionally\r\nhappened, a patient of more mature years, with enlarged facial\r\ncapillaries, received a wound of the lung, the course was in no way so\r\nfavourable as that witnessed in the case of the younger men.\r\n\r\nIn support of this opinion I may add that wounds from shrapnel and\r\nfragments of shell also did remarkably well, although they sometimes\r\ngave rise to more troublesome symptoms than did wounds produced by\r\nbullets of the Mauser type. Again, these injuries as a whole were of\r\nnothing like so serious a nature as the lacerations of the lung produced\r\nby fractured ribs, which we commonly have to treat in civil practice,\r\nand are not accustomed to regard as especially dangerous.\r\n\r\nIt is also a striking fact that the most common and troublesome\r\ncomplication of wounds of the chest, haemothorax, was usually the result\r\nof the wound of the chest-wall and not of the lung. I preface these\r\nremarks to the detailed account of the thoracic injuries, because I\r\nthink the favourable course usually taken by patients with wounds of the\r\nlung has been accorded somewhat greater prominence than the\r\ncircumstances warranted.\r\n\r\n_Non-penetrating wounds of the chest-wall._--Surface wounds were not\r\nvery common, and were chiefly of interest in so far as they illustrated\r\nthe very superficial course that may be occasionally taken by a bullet\r\nwithout breach of the integument, and as sometimes affording opportunity\r\nfor the exercise of diagnostic skill when the track traversed the\r\naxilla.\r\n\r\nThe most common situation for tracks taking a long course on the surface\r\nof the thoracic skeleton was the back. Such wounds were usually received\r\nwhile the patients were prone on the ground; thus I might instance a\r\ncase in which the bullet entered the posterior aspect of the shoulder 3\r\ninches above the spine of the scapula, passed downwards, pierced that\r\nprocess, and emerged 2 inches below the inferior angle of the bone.\r\nWounds of a similar nature coursing in transverse and oblique\r\ndirections, and not implicating bone, were also seen. Those implicating\r\nthe vertebrae have been already dealt with. The scapular region was also\r\na favourite one for the lodgment of retained bullets, some resting in\r\nthe supra- and infra-spinatus muscles, others lying beneath the bone\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nOn the anterior aspect of the chest, bullets coming from the front\r\nsometimes traversed and fractured the clavicle, and then took a short\r\ncourse downwards, emerging over the ribs or sternum. Figure 81\r\nrepresents a particularly long track in this region. In other cases the\r\nprecordial region was crossed, but I never witnessed any serious effect\r\non the heart's action in any such injury at the time the patients came\r\nunder my notice.\r\n\r\nWounds received with the arm outstretched and traversing the axilla\r\nsometimes gave considerable trouble in excluding with certainty a\r\nperforation of the thoracic cavity. Thus a bullet entered below the\r\ncentre of the right clavicle and emerged 2-1/2 inches below, above the\r\nangle of the scapula, at its axillary margin. The arm was outstretched\r\nat the moment of the reception of the injury; but when the wound was\r\nviewed with the limb placed alongside the trunk, it seemed almost\r\nimpossible that the chest cavity could have escaped. In some cases of\r\nthis kind the difficulty was at once cleared up by noting evidence of\r\ninjury to the axillary nerves.\r\n\r\nA word will suffice as to the treatment of these wounds. The only\r\nspecial indication was to keep the scapula at rest for a sufficient\r\nperiod. I have dealt with the anatomy of them at such length only\r\nbecause in their extreme form they are so highly characteristic of the\r\nnature of the injuries which may be produced by bullets of small\r\ncalibre.\r\n\r\n_Penetrating wounds of the chest._--Tracks crossing the thoracic cavity\r\nin every direction were common. When the erect attitude was maintained,\r\nfrontal and sagittal wounds, pure or oblique, were received; when the\r\nprone position was assumed, longitudinal tracks, either purely or\r\nobliquely vertical, were the rule. Experience of wounds of the latter\r\nclass was extensive in the present campaign, from the fact that so many\r\nof the advances were made in prone or crawling attitudes. The vertical\r\nand transverse tracks each possessed the special characteristic of\r\nfrequently implicating both the thoracic and abdominal cavities, but the\r\nvertical were often prolonged into the neck, or even downwards through\r\nthe pelvis. The vertical wounds in addition sometimes exhibited one very\r\nimportant feature, the fracture of several ribs from within, often at a\r\nvery considerable distance from the aperture of either entry or exit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Superficial Track in anterior Wall of Trunk]\r\n\r\n_Characters of the apertures of entry and exit._--As has already been\r\nmentioned, the chest-wall was one of the situations in which the\r\naperture of entry was often large, and the oval form due to obliquity of\r\nimpact on the part of the bullet was particularly well marked. The exit\r\nwounds were often smaller than those of entry, especially if the bullet\r\nemerged by an intercostal space; even when the ribs were comminuted, the\r\nfragments were, as a rule, too small to occasion more than a slightly\r\nenlarged and irregular aperture. Taken as a class, however, and putting\r\naside explosive exit wounds, wounds of the chest afforded more numerous\r\nexamples of irregular outline and variation in size than were met with\r\nin any other region of the body.\r\n\r\nWhen the tracks penetrated the broad upper intercostal spaces, an\r\ninteresting feature, due to the tense and rigid nature of the muscles\r\nclosing the intervals, and their large admixture of fibrous tissue, was\r\nsometimes noticed. The bullet, especially if passing obliquely, was apt\r\nto cut a slit in the muscles far exceeding in size the opening in the\r\noverlying integument, with the result of leaving a palpable subcutaneous\r\ndefect. Under these circumstances the yielding spot was often noticed to\r\nrise and fall with the movements of respiration, external palpation met\r\nwith an absence of normal resistance, and there was impulse on coughing.\r\n\r\n_Fractures of the ribs._--These injuries were produced in either\r\ntransverse or longitudinal coursing tracks, their special feature being\r\na sharp localisation of the lesion of the bone.\r\n\r\nIn tracks crossing the chest transversely the injury to the ribs might\r\nconsist in notching, perforation, or complete solution of continuity,\r\nsometimes with fine comminution. In the incomplete injuries some\r\nimportance attached to the localisation of the lesion to the upper or\r\nlower border of the rib, in so far as the intercostal artery was\r\nconcerned. Comminution at the wound of entry was, as a rule, not so\r\nextensive as at the aperture of exit, and in any case was less apparent,\r\nsince the fragments were driven inward. The wider comminution at the\r\nexit aperture depends on the lesser degree of support afforded by the\r\nthoracic coverings to the convex outer surface of the rib, and on the\r\nfact that the velocity of the bullet has been lowered by its passage\r\nthrough the opposite rib and the chest cavity.\r\n\r\nThe splinters of comminuted ribs are small, and wide-reaching fissures\r\nrare. These characters depend on the elastic nature of the resistance\r\noffered by the curved rib to the passage of the bullet, which is\r\ncalculated to preserve the bone from the full force of impact, except at\r\nthe point actually impinged upon.\r\n\r\nFractures of the ribs, produced from within by bullets taking a\r\nlongitudinal course through the thorax, were still more special in\r\ncharacter. They were also more important, as giving rise to troublesome\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nIn these, again, the degree of injury to the bones varied considerably.\r\nIn some cases the bones were merely grooved internally, without any\r\nexternal deformity; in other cases a sort of green-stick fracture was\r\nproduced, accompanied by the projection of a tender salient angle\r\nexternally; in others complete solution of continuity was effected.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of importance was the occasional implication of several\r\nribs. In this case the symptoms accompanying the injury were very much\r\nmore like those observed in the corresponding injuries resulting from\r\nindirect violence seen in civil practice.\r\n\r\nInjuries to the _costal cartilages_ closely resembled those to the ribs.\r\nPerforation, bending from injury to the inner aspect, and comminution\r\nwere observed. The latter condition differed from the similar one seen\r\nin the case of the ribs only in so far as the tougher consistence of the\r\ncartilage did not lend itself to such free comminution, and the\r\nsplinters remained in great part attached. The nature of the fractures,\r\nin fact, somewhat resembled that seen on breaking a piece of cane.\r\n\r\nI saw no fracture of the _sternum_ except of the nature of a pure\r\nperforation; these were not uncommon in the hospitals, either in the\r\nupper or the extreme lower portions of the bone. Fractures in other\r\nportions were no doubt usually associated with fatal injuries to the\r\nheart. The openings were usually so small as to be difficult of\r\npalpation, and I never had the opportunity of examining one _post\r\nmortem_.\r\n\r\nPerforations of the body of the _scapula_ were common, but they were of\r\nlittle importance in symptoms or prognosis.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of fracture of the ribs._--Fractures accompanying transverse\r\nwounds of the chest were characterised by the insignificance of the\r\nsymptoms produced. Every common sign of fracture of the rib was in fact\r\nabsent. Neither pain, stitch on inspiration, nor crepitus, either\r\naudible or palpable, was, as a rule, present. This absence of signs was\r\naccounted for by the nature of the lesion: thus in perforations or\r\nnotchings there was no loss of continuity, while in the freely\r\ncomminuted fractures the loss of continuity was so absolute as to allow\r\nno possibility of the main fragments rubbing together. Again, part of\r\nthe symptoms attending these injuries, as seen in civil practice,\r\ndepends upon contusion and laceration of the surrounding structures--a\r\ncondition precluded by the localised nature of the application of the\r\nviolence by a bullet of small calibre. In order to establish a\r\ndiagnosis, therefore, we were in many cases reduced to palpation, and\r\noccasionally to direct examination of the wound.\r\n\r\nFractures accompanying longitudinal tracks formed a class rather apart\r\nin the matter of symptoms. In these mere groovings might also be\r\naccompanied by no signs, or at the most by slight local pain and\r\ntenderness. When, however, the grooving was sufficiently deep to be\r\naccompanied by deformity, or a complete solution of continuity was\r\neffected, the signs were often severe. The tender salient angle, or, in\r\nthe absence of this, a highly tender localised spot, often pointed to\r\nthe less severe injuries, and when the fractures were complete or\r\nmultiple, pain was a very prominent symptom, both constant and in the\r\nform of inspiratory stitch. The severity of the pain was probably to be\r\nin part ascribed to implication of the intercostal nerves, which in\r\nthese injuries was direct and often multiple. Again, severe contusion or\r\nactual laceration of the nerves, with resulting anaesthesia, was less\r\ncommon than when the bullet directly implicated the nerves in transverse\r\nwounds. Free comminution and absolute solution of continuity were also\r\nless common than in the fractures accompanying transverse wounds; hence\r\npain from rubbing of the fragments on inspiratory movement or palpation\r\nwas more common, and crepitus, either on auscultation or palpation, was\r\nmore often met with. Patients with this class of fracture often suffered\r\ngreatly from painful dyspnoea, and were unable to assume the supine\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n_External haemorrhage_ of severity was rare from these thoracic wounds;\r\nin many cases it did not amount to more than local staining of the\r\nshirt; altogether I saw only one or two cases where any serious bleeding\r\noccurred. Internal haemorrhage into the pleura, in consequence of the\r\nposition of the intercostal arteries, was common, and often abundant;\r\nthis will be treated of under the heading of haemothorax.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of fractured ribs._--Transverse wounds of the thorax, with no\r\nsymptoms of fractured ribs, needed to be dealt with as wounds of the\r\nsoft parts alone.\r\n\r\nIn multiple fractures accompanying longitudinal tracks, bandaging or\r\nstrapping for the purpose of fixation was necessary to relieve pain. A\r\nfew fragments of bone sometimes needed primary removal, and occasionally\r\nsmall sequestra were removed at a later date; but necrosis was rare,\r\nunless some complication led to the development of a fistula.\r\n\r\nRetained bullets were occasionally met with in the chest wall. In such\r\ncases the last remaining energy of the bullet often seemed to have been\r\nspent in diving under the margin of a rib and turning longitudinally up\r\nor down. Removal was sometimes necessary, either from the prominence\r\nproduced, the presence of pain, or the continuance of suppuration. Some\r\nof the specimens removed offered interesting evidence of the capacity of\r\nthe ribs to withstand considerable violence from a bullet. These were\r\nslightly bent, and marked by a half-spiral groove. I saw such bullets\r\nremoved from the thoracic and the abdominal wall, and the evidence\r\nseemed rather against the groove having been produced prior to their\r\nentrance into the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Spirally grooved Mauser Bullet]\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the diaphragm._--Perforations of the diaphragm were very\r\nfrequent, and as a rule of small significance. When, however, the course\r\ntaken by the bullet was parallel with that of the slope of the\r\ndiaphragm, a more or less extensive slit was the result. I saw such a\r\nwound still gaping, and 2 inches in length, in the body of a patient\r\nwho died three weeks after the infliction of a fatal abdominal injury.\r\n\r\nIn several other obliquely transverse thoracic wounds there was reason\r\nto assume the existence of similar slits. Certain signs were more or\r\nless constant under these circumstances. These consisted in shallow\r\nrespiration, often accompanied by a groan or the slightest degree of\r\nhiccough on inspiration, and considerable increase in respiratory\r\nfrequency. In one patient the respirations were at first 48, only\r\ndropping to 36 some seventy hours after the reception of the injury. In\r\nsome of the cases in which the abdominal cavity was implicated, wound to\r\nthe diaphragm seemed a more likely explanation of early, frequent, and\r\npainful vomiting than did visceral injury. The possibility of the later\r\ndevelopment of diaphragmatic herniae in some of these patients will have\r\nto be borne in mind in the future.\r\n\r\n_Visceral injuries._--The frequent escape of the thoracic viscera from\r\ninjury, putting aside the lungs which fill so great a part of the\r\ncavity, was very remarkable. I never saw a case in which I could assume\r\ninjury to any of the posterior mediastinal viscera, although such may\r\nhave occurred on the field of battle. An injury to the oesophagus, for\r\ninstance, would almost of necessity be accompanied by wound of either\r\none of the large vessels, even the thoracic aorta, or the spinal column.\r\nI was somewhat surprised, however, to learn on enquiry from surgeons who\r\nhad seen a large number of the dead and dying on the field, that\r\nthoracic wounds, putting aside those that directly implicated the heart,\r\nwere responsible for but a small proportion of the fatalities.\r\n\r\nThe escape of the posterior mediastinal viscera, the great vessels, and\r\nthe heart, is, I believe, to be explained by the fact that all are\r\nsupported and held in position by the loose meshed mediastinal tissue,\r\nwhich allows for their displacement after the manner observed in the\r\ncase of the vessels and nerves lying in the loose tissue of the great\r\nvascular clefts.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the heart._--Perforating wounds of the heart were probably\r\nfatal in all instances, in spite of the fact that, in some patients who\r\nsurvived, the position of wound apertures on the surface of the body\r\nmade it difficult to believe that the heart had not been penetrated.\r\n(See cases below.)\r\n\r\nIn the case of this organ, we must bear in mind its constant variations\r\nin bulk, its elastic compressibility, and its variations in position in\r\nsystole and diastole. The variations in bulk and position would be\r\ncapable of explaining the escape of the organ from injury at some\r\nparticular moment, when a second shot apparently through the same wound\r\ntrack might implicate it. Beyond this, reasoning from the case of\r\nanalogous hollow viscera, as the arteries or the intestine, a bullet\r\nmight readily score the surface of the heart without perforating its\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nSuch accidents were observed. Thus, in a case examined by Mr. Cheatle,\r\nthe patient died of suppurative pericarditis, secondary to a wound of\r\nwhich the external apertures had closed. In this patient both auricle\r\nand ventricle were scored externally by the passage of the bullet.\r\n\r\nI am, however, disinclined to allow that many patients survived direct\r\nblows on the heart, since I believe that in the majority if not in all\r\ncardiac wounds the actual cause of death was not haemorrhage, but sudden\r\nstoppage of the heart's action. This is to be inferred from the fact\r\nthat severe external haemorrhage did not occur; in some cases the shirt\r\nwas hardly stained, and in all death occurred in the course of a very\r\nfew minutes. Again, in none of the patients whom I saw who had received\r\npossible wounds of the heart-wall were there evident signs of\r\nhaemo-pericardium. In view of the difficulty of detecting this condition\r\nfrom physical signs, this argument is naturally not of great weight, but\r\nmust be allowed.\r\n\r\nOne or two death scenes from cardiac wound were described to me. In one\r\nthe patient muttered 'They have got me this time,' and died quietly; in\r\na second the patient's face became ghastly pale, he lay on his back with\r\nthe knees flexed, clutching the ground, gasping for breath, and died\r\nonly after some minutes of evident great agony. The absence of any\r\n_post-mortem_ details as to the condition of the heart in these injuries\r\nis much to be regretted.\r\n\r\n     (145) _Entry_, in the seventh left intercostal space, in the\r\n     posterior axillary line; _exit_, immediately below the ninth\r\n     costal cartilage, close to the position of the gall bladder.\r\n\r\n     This track in all probability involved the diaphragm twice,\r\n     both lungs and pleurae, and passed immediately beneath the\r\n     heart. The liver was also perforated, but the spleen and\r\n     stomach probably escaped as far as could be judged from the\r\n     symptoms. The patient afterwards developed a pneumo-haemo-thorax\r\n     on the right side. The immediate symptoms were great distress\r\n     in breathing and rapid irregular pulse. The difficulty in\r\n     respiration was probably in part accounted for by the injuries\r\n     to the lung and diaphragm. The pulse remained from 112 to 120\r\n     for three days, at first soft and hardly perceptible, later\r\n     very irregular, and dropping one every fifth or sixth beat; and\r\n     it seemed fair to attribute this to the shock to the nervous\r\n     mechanism of the heart. The patient recovered from the chest\r\n     injury.\r\n\r\n     In some other patients in whom the track passed close below the\r\n     heart a disturbance of the pulse rate was noted, but this was\r\n     in some cases a slowing, not below 48, in others quickening to\r\n     100, with irregularity both in force and beat.\r\n\r\n     (146) _Entry_, in the fourth right interspace, 3 inches from\r\n     the middle line; _exit_, in the seventh left interspace, in the\r\n     mid-axillary line. This wound was received at a distance of\r\n     500-600 yards, but the bullet penetrated both sides of a stout\r\n     silver cigarette case and some cigarettes before entering the\r\n     body. There were minor signs of pulmonary injury, 'coughing day\r\n     and night,' and slight discoloration of the sputum on three or\r\n     four occasions. The respirations were quickened to 32, and as\r\n     much as ten days after the injury the pulse only beat 48 to the\r\n     minute; it then rose to 56, but beat in a very deliberate\r\n     manner.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the signs were almost nil.\r\n\r\n     (147) _Entry_, in the fourth right intercostal space 3/4 of an\r\n     inch from the sternum; _exit_, in the sixth left interspace in\r\n     the posterior axillary line. This patient had no symptoms,\r\n     beyond quickening of the pulse to 100, and a 'feeling of\r\n     tightness at the heart.' He shortly returned to active duty.\r\n\r\n     (148) _Entry_, situated in the third right interspace 3 inches\r\n     from the sternal margin; _exit_, in the fourth left space 2-3/4\r\n     inches from the sternal margin. In this case the bullet without\r\n     doubt passed through the anterior mediastinum, and slight\r\n     injury to the lung was evidenced by transient haemoptysis.\r\n\r\nSome remarks regarding wounds of the thoracic vessels have already been\r\nmade in Chapter IV., where instances of injury to the innominate and\r\nleft subclavian arteries are recounted. The escape of the large trunks\r\nwas generally quite as astonishing as in other parts of the body,\r\nespecially in the superior mediastinum.\r\n\r\n     (149) _Entry_, over the first right intercostal space beneath\r\n     the centre of the clavicle; _exit_, at left anterior axillary\r\n     fold. The great vessels must have been crossed here in\r\n     immediate contact, and considerable haemorrhage from the wound\r\n     of entry caused great anxiety; this ceased spontaneously,\r\n     however, and, beyond transient haemoptysis and a right\r\n     pneumo-thorax, no further trouble occurred.\r\n\r\n     (150) _Entry_, in the ninth interspace, just anterior to the\r\n     anterior axillary line; _exit_, through the right half of the\r\n     sternum, 1/2 an inch below the upper border. No primary\r\n     haemorrhage of importance followed, but I believe this patient\r\n     subsequently died. The wound was received at a range of within\r\n     fifty yards.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the lungs._--Numerically, pulmonary wounds formed the most\r\nimportant series of visceral injuries met with in the thorax, the\r\nfrequency of incidence corresponding with the proportionate sectional\r\narea occupied by the organs. Although these injuries did well, and\r\nneeded little interference on the part of the surgeon, many points of\r\ninterest were raised by them.\r\n\r\nThus the comparative importance of the wound in the chest-wall to that\r\nin the lung itself, was scarcely what, without actual experience, would\r\nhave been expected, the former proving so very much the more important\r\nelement of the two.\r\n\r\nThe question of velocity on the part of the bullet took a very secondary\r\nposition in these injuries. I saw a number of cases in which the\r\npatients estimated the range at which they received their wounds as from\r\n30 to 50 yards, and although some of the wounds were of a severe type,\r\nthe increased gravity depended rather on the injury to the chest-wall\r\nthan to that of the lung. If the bullet passed by the intercostal space,\r\navoiding the rib, I very much doubt if the relative velocity was of any\r\nimportance, further than from the fact that a sufficiently low degree to\r\nallow of lodgment of the bullet was distinctly unfavourable.\r\n\r\nIn view of the general lack of significance in these injuries it was\r\ninteresting to note how very definite was the ill effect of early\r\ntransport on the after course. This depended on the frequent development\r\nof parietal haemothorax in patients who were not kept absolutely at rest.\r\n\r\nThe tracks produced in the lungs by the bullets were very minute, and in\r\nthe few cases in which opportunity arose for their examination _post\r\nmortem_ some little time after the infliction of the wound, there was\r\ngreat difficulty in localising them. The slight damage incurred by the\r\npulmonary tissue is due to its elasticity and non-resistent character.\r\n\r\nPulmonary haemothorax was distinctly rare. Reasoning from the analogous\r\nwounds of the liver, tracks scoring the surface of these organs might be\r\nmuch more to be feared than clean perforations. The elasticity of the\r\nlung tissue, however, must make such lesions rare. In point of fact,\r\nthere is no reason why a perforation by a bullet of small calibre should\r\nbe much more feared than a puncture from an exploring trocar, and the\r\ndanger of the two wounds is probably very nearly the same.\r\n\r\nThe only points of importance as to the particular region of the lung\r\ntraversed were the distance from the periphery as affecting the probable\r\nsize of the vessels injured, and perhaps the implication of the base or\r\napex of the organ respectively. I am under the impression that wounds in\r\nthe apical region were somewhat more liable to be followed by the\r\ndevelopment of pneumothorax, and possibly haemothorax, while wounds at\r\nthe base gained their chief importance from the frequency of concurrent\r\ninjury to the abdominal viscera. I had no experience of the immediate\r\nresults of wound of the great vessels at the root of the lung, but\r\nassume that they led to speedy death.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of wound of the lung._--I shall describe the whole complex\r\nusually observed, although it is obvious that the wound of the\r\nchest-wall is responsible for a large proportion of the signs.\r\n\r\nThe majority of these injuries were accompanied by a certain degree of\r\nsystemic shock, and this was more marked in wounds received at a short\r\nrange. The shock was, however, rather to be attributed to the injury to\r\nthe chest-wall and thoracic concussion than to that to the lung itself.\r\nI think it may also be stated that few patients were inclined to walk\r\nor remain in the erect position after receiving these wounds; this\r\nfeature was also noted in horses in whom a bullet passed through the\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\nThe remarks made as to the pain accompanying fractures of the ribs apply\r\nequally here. Pain was not a prominent symptom, except in so far as the\r\nactual impact caused temporary suffering. It was striking how often\r\npatients who received wounds through the arm prior to the same bullet\r\ntraversing the chest appreciated the chest wound only, yet the chest\r\nmight pass unnoticed when a still more sensitive part was struck later,\r\nas has been already mentioned in the section on wounds in general.\r\n\r\nDyspnoea was not a prominent primary symptom. The patients sometimes\r\nhad 'all the wind knocked out of them' at the moment of impact, but when\r\nseen at the Field hospitals a short time later, the respirations were\r\nshallow, but easy and regular, and only moderately quickened; thus 24\r\nwas a not uncommon rate. Naturally if accumulation of blood in the\r\npleura began early and continued, these remarks do not hold good; and\r\nagain in some older men of full-blooded type and the subjects of\r\nrecurrent attacks of bronchitis, a considerable degree of pain,\r\ndyspnoea, and even cyanosis was sometimes present soon after the\r\ninjury. The complication of wound of the diaphragm has already been\r\nreferred to in this relation.\r\n\r\nLocal respiratory immobility of the thoracic parietes and consequent\r\nasymmetry of movement were constant. This was especially a marked\r\nfeature when the upper part of the chest was implicated on one side\r\nonly. It rather corresponded, however, to the local shock observed in\r\nwounds of the limbs than to the instinctive immobility accompanying\r\nfractures of the ribs; since, as already explained, small-calibre bullet\r\nwounds of the ribs are not necessarily painful on movement, and the sign\r\nexisted even when the bullet had passed by an intercostal space. This\r\nsign was naturally a transitory one.\r\n\r\nHaemoptysis was a fairly constant sign, but sometimes quite absent when\r\nno doubt could exist as to the perforation of the lung. As a rule, a\r\nconsiderable quantity of blood might be coughed up shortly after the\r\ninjury; but I never knew this to be sufficient in amount to give rise\r\nto any misgivings as to danger from the haemorrhage. After the first\r\nevacuation of blood from the wounded lung, the sign varied much; in the\r\nmajority of instances the patients continued to expectorate small\r\nquantities of blood mixed with mucus, for some three or four days, the\r\nblood gradually assuming a coagulated condition. Sometimes only the\r\nprimary haemoptysis was noted, and still more rarely the expectoration of\r\nclots was continued for a week, or even longer. This probably depended\r\npartly on personal idiosyncrasy, partly on the size of the vessels which\r\nhad been implicated in the track.\r\n\r\nCough was not commonly the troublesome symptom noted in the contused\r\nwounds of the lung seen in civil practice accompanying fracture of the\r\nribs. Moist sounds were usually audible on auscultation, but in many\r\ncases over a very limited area and only on the first few days.\r\n\r\nCellular emphysema was distinctly rare, and usually limited in extent:\r\nthus I saw it in the posterior triangle of the neck alone in an apical\r\nwound; over about a third of the upper part of the thorax in another\r\nwound through the second intercostal space, and in this case oddly\r\nenough the emphysema was the only sign of injury to the lung; and very\r\noccasionally widely distributed--in the latter case there were also\r\nusually multiple fractures of the ribs. Neither issue of air from the\r\nexternal wound nor frothy blood was ever seen with small-calibre wounds,\r\nbut I saw one instance in a case of Martini-Henry wound.\r\n\r\n_Pneumothorax_ was also rare. I saw pneumothorax three times out of\r\nabout half a dozen Martini-Henry wounds, but I do not think it occurred\r\nas often in 100 small-calibre wounds. The Martini-Henry wounds all\r\nrecovered; but convalescence was very prolonged, and the same remark to\r\na less degree holds good in the small-calibre cases.\r\n\r\nThat the slow recovery in cases of pneumothorax in the Martini-Henry\r\nwounds was due mainly to the size of the opening in the thoracic\r\nparietes was, I think, proved by the fact that in the small-calibre\r\nbullet wounds, followed by the development of pneumothorax, the external\r\nwounds were usually large and irregular in type; also, that in the only\r\npneumothorax which I saw produced during an extraction operation, the\r\nair was very rapidly absorbed. In the latter case, however, there was\r\nlittle reason to conclude that wound of the lung had occurred primarily,\r\nand certainly no opening existed at the time the thorax was incised.\r\n\r\n_Haemothorax._--This was the most frequent and also the most interesting\r\nof the complications of wound of the chest. In 90 per cent. or more of\r\nthe cases, the haemorrhage was of parietal source, and due either to\r\ndirect injury to the intercostal vessels by the bullet or to laceration\r\nby spicules of comminuted ribs. For this reason, the passage of the\r\nbullet whether by an intercostal space, or through a rib, provided the\r\nwound was not at the posterior part of the space where the artery\r\ncrosses, was a point of considerable prognostic importance. Exclusion of\r\nthe lung as the source of haemorrhage was, I think, amply justified by\r\nthe absence of continuous recurrent or progressive haemoptysis in the\r\nmajority of the cases, and by the very small trace of injury found in\r\nthe lungs of patients who died some weeks after the injury. In such it\r\nwas difficult to discriminate the tracks at all. I only happened to see\r\none case where free haemoptysis, during the course of development of a\r\nhaemothorax, pointed to the lung as the source of the blood.\r\n\r\nHaemorrhage into the pleural cavity occurred in some degree in a very\r\nlarge proportion of the chest wounds, but it was especially interesting\r\nto note how greatly its extent was influenced by the amount of transport\r\nto which the patients were subjected in the early stages after the\r\ninjury. During the early part of the campaign, on the western side, I\r\nsaw a large number of chest wounds, and had I been asked my opinion as\r\nto the relative frequency of occurrence of haemothorax I should have\r\nplaced it at about 30 per cent. The patients in these early battles\r\nneeded little wagon transport, and when sent down to the Base travelled\r\nin comfortable ambulance trains. After the commencement of the march\r\nfrom Modder River to Bloemfontein, however, these conditions were\r\nchanged, and all the chest as other cases were exposed to the necessity\r\nof three days and nights' journey to the Stationary hospitals and\r\nafterwards to the long journey to Cape Town. Of these patients, at\r\nleast 90 per cent. suffered with haemothorax of varying degrees of\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the least common, signs of considerable intra-pleural\r\nhaemorrhage immediately followed the wound; in others, the accumulation\r\nof blood was gradual, and only manifest in any degree at the end of\r\nthree or four days, when it became stationary if the patient was kept at\r\nrest. In a second series the haemorrhage was of the recurrent variety;\r\nthese cases differing little in character from those of slight\r\ncontinuous haemorrhage. In a third, the bleeding was definitely of a\r\nsecondary character, corresponding with one of the classes of secondary\r\nhaemorrhage described in Chapter IV., and occurring on the eighth or\r\ntenth day from giving way of an imperfectly closed wounded vessel. In\r\neither of the two latter classes the development of the haemothorax often\r\ncorresponded with a journey, or with allowing the patient to get up.\r\n\r\nThe general course of these effusions was towards spontaneous absorption\r\nand recovery. Coagulation of the blood took place early, the fluid serum\r\nseparated, and tended to undergo absorption with some rapidity, leaving\r\na small amount of coagulum at the base, which evidenced its presence for\r\nmany weeks by a persistence of a certain degree of dulness on\r\npercussion. Early coagulation, I think, accounted for the usual absence\r\nof gravitation ecchymosis as a sign.\r\n\r\nThe course to recovery was sometimes broken by signs of slight pleuritic\r\ninflammation, which, as affecting the amount of effusion, will be spoken\r\nof under the heading of symptoms. In some cases the amount of blood was\r\nso great as to necessitate means being taken for its removal; in these a\r\nreaccumulation often took place. Occasionally an empyema followed in\r\ncases thus treated.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the blood evacuated on tapping varied much. In very early\r\naspirations unchanged blood was often met with, but clot sometimes made\r\nevacuation difficult and necessitated a second puncture. In the tappings\r\ndone at the end of a week or more a dark porter-like fluid was common,\r\nwhile when suppuration was imminent a brick-red-coloured grumous fluid\r\nreplaced normal blood. In the cases where early incision was resorted\r\nto, blood both fluid and in clots was often mixed with a certain\r\nproportion of lymph flakes, perhaps indicating the part taken by\r\ninflammatory reaction to the irritation of the clot in producing the\r\nrise of temperature.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of haemothorax._--In the more severe cases of primary bleeding\r\nthe symptoms did not, as a rule, reach their full height until the third\r\nor fourth day after the injury. The patients then often suffered\r\nseverely. The pulse and temperature rose, and to general symptoms of\r\nloss of blood were added: occasional lividity of countenance; severe\r\ndyspnoea, accompanied by inability to lie on the sound side or to\r\nassume the supine position; absence of respiratory movement on the\r\ninjured side; pain, restlessness, cough, and sometimes continuance of\r\nhaemoptysis, small clots usually being expectorated.\r\n\r\nAccompanying these symptoms were the usual physical signs of fluid in\r\nthe pleura in differing degrees and combination. Dulness of varying\r\nextent up to complete absence of resonance on one side, often\r\naccompanied in the incomplete cases by well-marked skodaic resonance\r\nanteriorly. Loss of vocal resonance, and fremitus; oegophony, tubular\r\nrespiration over the root of the lung or at the upper limit of the\r\ndulness, and more or less extensive displacement of the heart. Obvious\r\nincrease in girth, fulness of the intercostal spaces, or gravitation\r\necchymosis was rare. The latter was most common in instances in which\r\nmultiple fracture of the ribs existed (see fig. 83). I think the rarity\r\nof the last sign must have been due to the early coagulation of the\r\nblood, and its retention by the pleura, as I saw well-marked gravitation\r\necchymosis in one or two cases of mediastinal haemorrhage.\r\n\r\nThe above complex of symptoms was common to all the cases, but in the\r\nslighter ones they gave rise to little trouble, and cleared up with\r\ngreat rapidity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Gravitation Ecchymosis in a case of Haemothorax,\r\naccompanying fracture of three ribs from within. The influence of the\r\nfractures on the development of the ecchymosis is shown by the linear\r\narrangement of the discoloration]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature was offered by the temperature, as this was\r\nvery liable to lead one astray. A primary rise always occurred with the\r\ncollection of blood in the pleura, this reaching its height on the third\r\nor fourth day, usually about 102 deg. F. in well-marked cases; it then fell,\r\nand in favourable instances remained normal. In a large number of cases,\r\nhowever, where the amount of blood was considerable, this was not the\r\ncase, the primary fall not reaching the normal, and a second rise\r\noccurred which reached the same height as before or higher. The second\r\nrise was accompanied by sweating, quickened pulse, and the probability\r\nof the development of an empyema had always to be considered. I believe\r\nin most cases this secondary rise was an indication of a further\r\nincrease in the haemorrhage, for the dulness usually increased in extent,\r\nand such rises were often seen when the patient had been moved or taken\r\na journey. Again, the temperature often fell to normal after\r\nparacentesis and removal of the blood, to rise again with a fresh\r\naccumulation, which was not uncommon. I have already mentioned the large\r\nproportional incidence of haemothorax observed in the patients who had\r\nto travel down from Paardeberg, and I might instance another case\r\nrelated to me by Dr. Flockemann of the German ambulance, which was very\r\nstriking. A Boer, wounded at Colesberg, developed a haemothorax which\r\nquieted down, and he was removed to Bloemfontein; on arrival at the\r\nlatter place the temperature rose, and other signs of fever suggested\r\nthe development of an empyema; an exploring needle, however, only\r\nbrought blood to light. After a short stay at Bloemfontein the symptoms\r\nentirely subsided, and the man was sent to Kroonstadt, when an exactly\r\nsimilar attack resulted, again quieting down with rest.\r\n\r\nSimilar recurrent attacks of haemorrhage and fever occurred, however, in\r\npatients confined to their beds without moving after the first journey.\r\nSome temperature charts, in illustration of this point, are added to the\r\ncases quoted later. The explanation of the recurrent haemorrhages is, I\r\nthink, to be found in the reduction of the intra-thoracic pressure with\r\ncoagulation and shrinkage of the clot in the pleura in the patients kept\r\nquiet in bed, while in the patients who had to travel it was probably\r\nthe result of direct mechanical disturbance.\r\n\r\nIn many of these cases a pleural rub was audible at the upper margin of\r\nthe dulness with the development of the fresh symptoms. Whether this was\r\ndue to actual pleurisy or to the rubbing of surfaces rough from the\r\nbreaking down of slight recent adhesions which had formed a barrier to\r\nthe effusion, I am unable to say, but the signs were fairly constant. In\r\nsome instances the increase in the amount of fluid was, no doubt, due to\r\npleural effusion resulting from irritation from the presence of\r\nblood-clot, or perhaps the shifting of the latter; in these the\r\nsecondary rise of temperature may well be ascribed to the development of\r\npleurisy.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe, however, that the primary rise of temperature\r\nwas similar to that seen when blood accumulates in the peritoneal cavity\r\nas the result of trauma, and the secondary rises in most cases to those\r\nwhich we saw so frequently accompanying the interstitial secondary\r\nhaemorrhages spoken of in Chapter IV., and are to be explained on the\r\ntheory of absorption of a blood ferment. The secondary rises always\r\noccurred with a fresh effusion, often of blood, occasioning an\r\nextension, which broke down probable light adhesions and exposed a fresh\r\narea of normal pleural membrane to act as a surface for absorption.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, manifest that the fever might also be ascribed to the\r\ninfection of the clot or serum from without, and in the first cases I\r\nsaw I was inclined to take this view, since we had in every case the\r\nprimary wounds of chest-wall, and possibly of lung, and in some the\r\naddition of a puncture by an exploring needle between the first and\r\nsecond rise. After a wider experience, however, I abandoned the\r\ninfection theory, as it seemed opposed by the very infrequent sequence\r\nof suppuration. The effect of simple removal of the blood or serum was\r\nalso often so striking as to strongly suggest that it alone was\r\nresponsible for the fever. Exactly the same result, moreover, followed\r\nevacuation of the interstitial blood effusions already mentioned\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe common course of all the cases of haemothorax was to spontaneous\r\nrecovery, the rapidity of the subsidence of the signs depending mainly\r\non the quantity of the primary haemorrhage, and the occurrence of further\r\nincreases. The blood serum tended to collect at the upper limit of the\r\noriginal blood effusion (as was often proved on tapping), and this was\r\nfirst absorbed; the clot deposited on the pleural surface and at the\r\nbasal part of the cavity was, however, not absorbed with the same\r\nrapidity. In the majority of the patients when they left the hospitals,\r\nat the end of six weeks on an average, some dulness and deficiency of\r\nvesicular murmur always remained, and the clot and the surrounding\r\nsurface, irritated by its presence, will, no doubt, be responsible for\r\npermanent adhesions in many cases. That such adhesions do form in the\r\nmajority of cases I feel certain, as, although these patients when they\r\nleft the hospital were to all intents and purposes apparently well, few\r\nof them could undertake sustained exertion without getting short of\r\nbreath, and sometimes suffering from transitory pain, and for this\r\nreason it became customary to invalid them home.\r\n\r\nIn a small proportion of the cases empyema followed; but I never saw\r\nthis in any case that had neither been tapped nor opened, and I saw\r\nonly one patient die from a chest wound uncomplicated by other injuries.\r\nThis case was an interesting one of recurrent haemorrhage followed by\r\ninflammatory troubles:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 2.--Secondary Haemorrhages in a case of\r\nHaemothorax. Case No. 151]\r\n\r\n     (151) The wound was received at short range, probably at from\r\n     100 to 200 yards. _Entry_, 1 inch from the left axillary margin\r\n     in the first intercostal space; _exit_, at the back of the\r\n     right arm 1-1/2 inch below the acromial angle; both pleurae were\r\n     therefore crossed. The patient expectorated at first fluid,\r\n     then clotted, blood in considerable quantity. When brought into\r\n     the advanced Base hospital on the third day, there were signs\r\n     of blood in the left pleura, cellular emphysema over the right\r\n     side of the chest, and signs of collapse of the right lung. The\r\n     temperature chart gives shortly the course of the case: the\r\n     right pneumo-thorax cleared up spontaneously, also the\r\n     emphysema; but the left pleura needed tapping to relieve\r\n     symptoms of pressure on four occasions, the 13th, 15th, 19th,\r\n     and 25th days respectively. On the first two occasions blood\r\n     was removed, on the third blood serum only, and on the last\r\n     pus. The patient was relieved after each aspiration; after the\r\n     third, the temperature fell to normal, the general condition\r\n     also improved, and he promised to do well. None the less,\r\n     reaccumulation took place, the evacuated fluid assumed an\r\n     inflammatory character, and an incision to evacuate pus was\r\n     eventually followed by death on the twenty-seventh day. The\r\n     amount of haemoptysis throughout was considerable, and the case\r\n     was possibly one of pulmonary haemothorax, as after death no\r\n     source of haemorrhage could be localised in the intercostal\r\n     space. The track in the lung was almost healed, and although a\r\n     part of it allowed the introduction of a probe for about an\r\n     inch, it could be traced no further even on section of the\r\n     organ, and no special vessel could be located as the original\r\n     bleeding spot.\r\n\r\n_Empyema._--I may here add the little that I have to say on this\r\nsubject. During the whole campaign the single case of primary empyema\r\nthat I saw was the one recorded below, which deserves special mention as\r\nillustrating the disadvantage of extracting bullets on the field. Under\r\nthe conditions which necessarily accompanied this operation the\r\nensurance of asepsis was impossible, and the additional wound no doubt\r\nproved the source of infection.\r\n\r\n     (152) _Entry_, at the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid\r\n     muscle, 2 inches above the clavicle; the bullet came to the\r\n     surface beneath the skin over the fifth rib, in the nipple line\r\n     of the right side. There was never any haemoptysis, but the\r\n     patient suffered with some dyspnoea throughout. After a three\r\n     days' stay in the Field hospital, where the subcutaneous bullet\r\n     was removed, the patient was transported by wagon and train to\r\n     the Base, a journey of about 600 miles.\r\n\r\n     On the fifth day pus escaped from the extraction wound, and\r\n     when the case was examined at the Base, the temperature was\r\n     101 deg., the pulse over 100, the respirations 30, and the whole\r\n     side of the chest was dull, with the exception of a patch of\r\n     boxy resonance over the apex anteriorly. On the following day\r\n     the chest was drained, and a considerable amount of pus\r\n     evacuated, which was mixed with breaking-down blood-clot. A\r\n     fortnight later a second operation had to be performed to\r\n     improve the drainage, and the patient made a tedious recovery.\r\n\r\nThe following case well illustrates the symptoms in a severe case of\r\nhaemothorax, and empyema following aspiration:--\r\n\r\n     (153) The patient was wounded at Paardeberg at a range of from\r\n     500 to 700 yards. _Entry_, just to the left of the episternal\r\n     notch; _exit_, in the fifth left interspace posteriorly, midway\r\n     between the spine and vertebral margin of the scapula. A\r\n     quantity of bright blood was brought up at once, and later\r\n     blood was coughed up in clots.\r\n\r\n     There was no great pain at the moment of the injury; the man\r\n     again got up to the firing line, and later walked two miles to\r\n     the Field hospital without aid. He remained here a week, when\r\n     he was sent down to the Base, and during the first three days'\r\n     journey in the wagon he began to get worse. On the fourth day\r\n     cough began to be very troublesome.\r\n\r\n     When he arrived at the Base, fifteen days after the original\r\n     injury, there was much dyspnoea; the temperature was 102 deg.,\r\n     and the pulse 110. The left side of the chest was dull\r\n     throughout; an aspirating needle was introduced, and a pint of\r\n     very dark liquid blood drawn off. The whole of the blood was\r\n     not removed on account of the very severe cough and pain which\r\n     the evacuation occasioned. The man appeared to steadily improve\r\n     until three weeks later, when the temperature, which throughout\r\n     had been uneven, became consistently high, and signs of fluid\r\n     at the base increased. An aspirating needle was introduced, and\r\n     16 ounces of pus were drawn off. Two days later a piece of rib\r\n     was resected (Mr. Pegg) and another pint of pus evacuated.\r\n     After this, rapid improvement took place, and in ten days the\r\n     man was able to be up and dressed, although a small amount of\r\n     discharge still persisted. He eventually made an excellent\r\n     recovery.\r\n\r\nSecondary empyemata not uncommonly followed incision of the chest, or\r\nexcision of a rib for draining a haemothorax. These operations in the\r\nearly part of the campaign were more freely undertaken on the\r\nsupposition that rise of temperature and other symptoms of fever pointed\r\nto incipient breaking down of the clot. Subsequent experience showed\r\nthis not to be the case, and early operations for drainage ceased to be\r\nundertaken. In these operations a primary difficulty was met with in\r\neffectively clearing out the clot, a drain had to be left, and\r\nsuppuration occurred later in a considerable proportion. The\r\nsuppurations were most troublesome; local adhesions formed, and the pus\r\ncollected in small pockets, which were difficult to find and to drain,\r\nand even when the collections seemed to have been successfully dealt\r\nwith at the time, residual abscesses often followed at a very late date.\r\nThus, I saw a case with a contracted chest and a fresh abscess the day\r\nbefore I left Cape Town, in whom I had advised and witnessed an\r\noperation for the evacuation of clot in the presence of signs of fever a\r\nweek after my arrival in the country, nine months previously. I saw\r\nanother case where general infection followed incision of a haemothorax,\r\nbut the patient fortunately recovered.\r\n\r\nThe question of _pleurisy_ has already been mentioned in connection with\r\nhaemothorax; it no doubt accounted for secondary effusion in some cases,\r\nand beyond this I have nothing to add to what has been there said.\r\n\r\n_Pneumonia_ was rare; there were occasionally signs of consolidation,\r\nbut, I think, quite as often in the opposite lung as in the one injured.\r\nI never saw a fatal case, and I am inclined to think that when it\r\noccurred it was as often the result of cold and exposure as of the\r\ninjury to the lung. Abscess of the lung I only saw once, and that in a\r\ncase in which the injury to the chest was complicated by paraplegia from\r\nspinal injury and septicaemia, and it was possibly pyaemic.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--No difficulties special to small-calibre wounds were\r\nexperienced, except such as have been already dealt with. The only class\r\nof case which frequently gave rise to difficulty was haemothorax. Here\r\ntwo points especially needed consideration. (1) _The source of the\r\nhaemorrhage as parietal or visceral._ As has been already foreshadowed,\r\nthis was mainly to be decided by the amount and persistence of the\r\nhaemoptysis, but naturally free haemoptysis did not negative concurrent\r\nparietal bleeding. Then the actual source of the bleeding other than\r\nfrom the lung had to be considered; in the great majority of cases the\r\nintercostal vessels were responsible, and attention to the course of the\r\ntracks often allowed this to be definitely decided upon.\r\n\r\nA case included in the chapter on Injuries to the Blood Vessels (No. 5,\r\np. 127) is of great interest in this particular; in that instance\r\nfeebleness of the radial pulse, together with the position of the wound,\r\nwas a valuable indication of injury to the subclavian artery, but\r\nweakened somewhat by the fact of retention of the bullet, and hence\r\nuncertainty as to the exact course that it had taken, and as to whether\r\nthe bullet itself was not responsible for pressure on the vessel. Such\r\nindications, however, should make one very chary of interference with a\r\nhaemothorax, even with extremely urgent symptoms, in the light of our\r\npresent knowledge of the nature of the lesions to the great vessels\r\nproduced by small-calibre bullets, and their tendency to be incomplete.\r\n\r\n(2) _The imminence of suppuration or its actual occurrence._--In most\r\ncases it sufficed to preserve an expectant attitude, and in the\r\npersistence or increase of symptoms, to have recourse to an exploratory\r\npuncture as the best means of solution of the difficulty.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis._--The prognosis both as to life and as to subsequent\r\nill-effects was remarkably good; in many cases of uncomplicated injury\r\nto the lung the patients rejoined their regiments at the end of a month\r\nor six weeks. In the more serious cases complicated by the collection of\r\nblood in the pleura, convalescence was more prolonged, and an average\r\ntime of six to eight weeks often elapsed before the patients could be\r\nsafely discharged from hospital. In the more serious a certain amount of\r\ndulness always persisted at this time over the base of the lung, and the\r\nchest was usually somewhat contracted on the injured side, with evidence\r\nin the way of decreased vesicular murmur that the lung was still not\r\nfree from compression. With regard to the persistence of dulness on\r\npercussion, it is well to bear in mind that a thin layer of blood\r\napparently produces as serious impairment of resonance as a much larger\r\nquantity of serum. The signs appeared to favour the view that the space\r\nnecessary for the location of the haemorrhage had been obtained at the\r\nexpense of the lung rather than by distension of the thoracic parietes,\r\nand also, I think, denoted the presence of adhesions. Possibly they will\r\nentirely disappear with the return of full excursion movements of\r\nrespiration, the latter being often still somewhat restricted when the\r\npatients left hospital. All the patients with such signs were liable to\r\nattacks of pain and shortness of breath on actual bodily exertion. I\r\nhappened to meet with an officer, the subject of a Lee-Metford wound of\r\nthe thorax, sustained five years previously, and he told me that he was\r\nnine months before he could take active exercise without feeling short\r\nof breath.\r\n\r\nAs to the cases of haemothorax and empyema which needed drainage, all did\r\nwell; but expansion of the lung was much less satisfactory than would\r\nhave been expected, probably on account of especially firm adhesions.\r\nThe importance of concurrent injury I need hardly dwell on; but I might\r\nadd that perforation of one or both arms, the most common one, did not\r\nmaterially affect the general statements above made.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In the early stages of the pulmonary wounds rest was the\r\nall-important indication, and when this was assured few serious cases of\r\nhaemothorax occurred. Beyond simple rest, the administration of opium\r\nwith a view to checking internal haemorrhage was used with good effect.\r\nThe wounds needed simple dressing only.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of haemothorax at a later date, however, was of much\r\ninterest and difficulty. I think the following lines may be laid down\r\nfor guidance in such cases:--\r\n\r\n(i) Haemothorax, even of considerable severity, will undergo spontaneous\r\ncure. An early rise of temperature may be disregarded.\r\n\r\n(ii) Tapping the chest is indicated when pressure signs on the lung are\r\nsufficiently severe to cause serious symptoms, and the removal of the\r\nblood undoubtedly shortens the period of recovery, as well as relieves\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the collection of blood has usually been rapid and\r\ncontinuous; hence a fresh haemorrhage is always probable when the local\r\npressure has been removed. Tapping therefore should not necessarily mean\r\ncomplete evacuation, and should be followed by careful firm binding up\r\nof the chest, the administration of opium, and the most stringent\r\nprecautions for rest.\r\n\r\n(iii) Tapping may be needed as a diagnostic aid, and in such\r\ncircumstances as much fluid as can be removed should be evacuated with\r\nthe same precautions as mentioned in the last paragraph.\r\n\r\n(iv) Tapping may be indicated for the evacuation of serum expressed from\r\nthe blood-clot, or due to pleural effusion, on the same lines as in any\r\nother collection of fluid in the pleural cavity.\r\n\r\n(v) Early free incision is, as a rule, to be steadfastly avoided. Some\r\ncases already quoted fully illustrate its disadvantages.\r\n\r\n(vi) Cases in which an incision and the ligature of a parietal artery\r\nare indicated are very rare. I never saw such a one myself.\r\n\r\n(vii) If a haemothorax suppurates, it must be treated on the ordinary\r\nlines of an empyema. In view of the constant formation of adhesions and\r\ndifficulty in drainage, a portion of a rib should always be resected in\r\norder to ensure sufficient space for after-treatment. The cavities, as a\r\nrule, are better irrigated, the usual precautions being taken where\r\nthere is any reason to fear that the lung is still in communication with\r\nthe cavity.\r\n\r\nCare in carrying out asepsis in tapping, which should be performed with\r\nan aspirator, need hardly be more than mentioned. It will be noted that\r\nin some of the cases quoted suppuration followed tapping, but it must be\r\nremembered that in these the two primary wounds already existed as\r\npossible channels of infection.\r\n\r\nRetained bullets of small calibre in the thoracic cavity were not\r\ncommon, unless the lodgment had occurred in the bodies of the vertebrae.\r\nI saw very few. Shrapnel bullets and fragments of shells, however, were,\r\nin proportion to the frequency of wounds from such projectiles, more\r\ncommonly retained. The rules to be followed in such cases do not\r\nmaterially deviate from those to be observed in the body generally.\r\n\r\nWhen the bullet is causing no trouble, and is lodged in either the bone\r\nof the spine or the lung substance, no interference is advisable. When,\r\non the other hand, the bullet as viewed by the X-rays is seen to be in\r\nthe pleural cavity, and any symptoms of its presence exist, it may be\r\njustifiable to remove it. I saw this done in one case for the removal of\r\na shrapnel bullet from the lower reflexion of the pleura on account of\r\nfixed pain and tenderness complained of by the patient. The bullet, a\r\nshrapnel, had perforated the arm, which the patient was sure was by his\r\nside at the moment of injury, and the X-rays showed it to lie at the\r\nbottom of the pleural cavity, where we assumed it had fallen. When,\r\nhowever, the bullet was removed by Mr. Watson, he found that the fixed\r\npain and tenderness had been the result of a fracture of a rib from the\r\ninner side, not involving loss of continuity; hence the actual\r\nindication for the operation had been a delusive one, since the bullet\r\nhad not fallen, but expended its last force in injuring the rib. The\r\npatient made an excellent recovery, and rejoined his regiment at the end\r\nof six weeks. I saw several cases in which the bullet was lodged in\r\neither the lung or bones of the spine do well with no interference. The\r\ngreat disadvantage of primary removal in inducing an artificial\r\npneumo-thorax and in laying open a haemothorax is obvious.\r\n\r\nIn case of lodgment of the bullet in the lung, bearing in mind the\r\ninfrequency of untoward symptoms, the latter should be watched for prior\r\nto interference.\r\n\r\nThe following cases illustrate some typical instances of wound of chest\r\naccompanied by the development of haemothorax:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 3.--Primary Haemothorax, with rise of\r\ntemperature. Secondary rise, with fresh effusion and pneumonia.\r\nSpontaneous recovery. Case No. 154]\r\n\r\n     (154) _Severe haemothorax. Spontaneous recovery._--Wounded at\r\n     Modder River at a distance of 30 yards. _Entry_, at the\r\n     junction of the left anterior axillary fold with the\r\n     chest-wall; _exit_, immediately to the left of the seventh\r\n     dorsal spinous process. The patient arrived at the Base with\r\n     signs of an extensive haemothorax, accompanied by a temperature\r\n     which reached 102 deg. on the fourth day, and on the evening of the\r\n     tenth 103 deg.. The man was very ill, and an exploring needle was\r\n     inserted, by which about an ounce of blood was evacuated. The\r\n     signs of fluid in the left pleura were accompanied by those of\r\n     consolidation over the lower fourth of the right lung, and the\r\n     sputa were rusty. Evidence of perforation of the left axillary\r\n     artery existed in feebleness of the radial pulse; and there was\r\n     musculo-spiral paralysis.\r\n\r\n     After the preliminary puncture, the man refused any further\r\n     operative treatment, although a second rise of temperature\r\n     commenced on the fifteenth day, culminating in a temperature of\r\n     103.2 deg. on the eighteenth. The further treatment of the patient\r\n     consisted in the ensurance of rest and the alleviation of pain.\r\n     A steady fall in the temperature extended over another three\r\n     weeks, together with diminution in the signs of fluid in the\r\n     pleura. At the end of seventy-four days the man was sent home,\r\n     some slight dulness at the left base, and contraction of the\r\n     chest sufficient to influence the spine in the way of lateral\r\n     curvature, being the only remaining signs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 4.--Primary Haemothorax. Secondary rise\r\nof temperature, with increase in the effusion. Spontaneous recovery.\r\nCase No. 155]\r\n\r\n     (155) _Severe haemothorax. Secondary effusion. Spontaneous\r\n     recovery._--Wounded at Koodoosberg Drift, at a distance of 200\r\n     yards. _Entry_, at angle of the right scapula; _exit_, at the\r\n     junction of the left anterior axillary fold with the\r\n     chest-wall. No signs of spinal cord injury. The patient was\r\n     brought in from the field twelve miles by an ambulance wagon on\r\n     the second day, and in crossing the Modder River he was\r\n     accidentally upset into the stream. For the first four days\r\n     there was no haemoptysis, but for the succeeding nine days small\r\n     brightish red clots were expectorated. There was some\r\n     tenderness over the ribs from the fifth to the ninth in the\r\n     axillary line, and on the ninth day some gravitation ecchymosis\r\n     appeared over the same region. Cough was an early troublesome\r\n     symptom in this case, and when admitted to the Base hospital,\r\n     about the seventh day, there was evidence of fluid extending\r\n     about a third of the way up the back.\r\n\r\n     On the tenth day after admission a pleural rub was detected at\r\n     the upper margin of the dulness, and the latter shortly\r\n     extended upwards over a little more than half the back.\r\n     Meanwhile, there was no further haemoptysis, respiration was\r\n     fairly easy, 24 per minute, but accompanied by slight\r\n     dilatation of the alae nasi, and the temperature, which had been\r\n     ranging from 99 deg. to 100 deg., began to rise steadily, on the\r\n     fifteenth day reaching 102.5 deg.. The patient refused even an\r\n     exploratory puncture, and was treated on the expectant plan.\r\n     The temperature slowly subsided, with a steady improvement in\r\n     the physical signs, and at the end of about ten weeks he left\r\n     for home with only slight dulness and incapacity for active\r\n     exertion remaining. (Now again on active service.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 5.--Haemothorax, primary and secondary\r\nrises of temperature, on each occasion falling on the evacuation of the\r\nblood. Case No. 156]\r\n\r\n     (156) _Severe haemothorax. Recurrent secondary effusion. Tapping\r\n     on two occasions. Cure._--The patient was wounded at\r\n     Paardeberg, and arrived at the Base on the eighteenth day.\r\n     _Entry_, below the first rib, just external to its junction\r\n     with the costal cartilage; _exit_, through the ninth rib, just\r\n     within the posterior axillary line. The whole right side of the\r\n     chest was dull, with signs of the presence of fluid, the heart\r\n     being displaced to the left. There was considerable distress;\r\n     the respirations averaged 40, the pulse 100, and the\r\n     temperature reached 101.5 deg. the first evening after arrival.\r\n\r\n     On the nineteenth day the thorax was aspirated (Mr. Hanwell)\r\n     and 50 ounces of dirty red-coloured fluid, half clot, half\r\n     serum, were evacuated. Considerable relief was afforded; the\r\n     respirations became slightly less frequent; the heart returned\r\n     to a normal position, and distant tubular respiration was\r\n     audible. The temperature dropped to normal the third day after\r\n     evacuation of the fluid, but on the sixth day it again\r\n     commenced to rise, and meanwhile fluid again began to collect.\r\n\r\n     On the twenty-sixth day a second aspiration resulted in the\r\n     evacuation of 35 ounces of bloody fluid in which flakes of\r\n     lymph were found. Three days later the temperature became\r\n     normal. The respirations fell to 22, and the patient made an\r\n     uninterrupted recovery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 6.--Wound of Lung. Secondary\r\ndevelopment of Haemothorax, with rise of temperature. Spontaneous\r\nrecovery. Case No 157]\r\n\r\n     (157) _Moderate haemothorax. Secondary effusion at the end of\r\n     twenty days. Spontaneous recovery._--Wounded at Paardeberg;\r\n     range from 700 to 1,000 yards. _Entry_, in the centre of the\r\n     second right intercostal space, anteriorly; _exit_, at the\r\n     level of the sixth rib posteriorly, through the scapula, close\r\n     to its vertebral margin.\r\n\r\n     The patient arrived at the Base on the sixth day; he said he\r\n     expectorated some blood at the end of about ten minutes after\r\n     being shot, and experienced a 'half-choking sensation.' A small\r\n     quantity of phlegm and occasional clots had been expectorated\r\n     since. He had walked about a good deal; movement occasioned\r\n     cough, and he became 'blown' very rapidly.\r\n\r\n     On admission there were signs of fluid in the lower third of\r\n     the pleural cavity, but no general symptoms beyond an evening\r\n     rise of temperature to an average of 99 deg.. About the twentieth\r\n     day the temperature commenced to rise, and on the twenty-third\r\n     and four following evenings reached 102 deg.. The fever was\r\n     accompanied by some distress, and a well-marked increase in the\r\n     physical signs of the presence of fluid in the chest. The pulse\r\n     rose to 96, and the respirations considerably above the average\r\n     of 24, which was at first noted. A strictly expectant attitude\r\n     was maintained, and the temperature steadily fell in a curve\r\n     corresponding to the rise, gradually reaching the normal at the\r\n     end of a week. The physical signs at the base steadily cleared\r\n     up, and at the end of six weeks the patient returned to England\r\n     convalescent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE ABDOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps no chapter of military surgery was looked forward to with more\r\neager interest than that dealing with wounds of the abdomen. In none was\r\ngreater expectation indulged in with regard to probable advance in\r\nactive surgical treatment, and in none did greater disappointment lie in\r\nstore for us.\r\n\r\nWounds of the solid viscera, it is true, proved to be of minor\r\nimportance when produced by bullets of small calibre; but wounds of the\r\nintestinal tract, although they showed themselves capable of spontaneous\r\nrecovery in a certain proportion of the cases observed, afforded but\r\nslight opportunity for surgical skill, and results generally deviated\r\nbut slightly from those of past experience. Such success as was met with\r\ndepended rather on the mechanical genesis and nature of the wounds than\r\nupon the efforts of the surgeon, and operative surgery scored but few\r\nsuccesses.\r\n\r\nIt is true that to the Civil Surgeon accustomed to surroundings replete\r\nwith every modern appliance and convenience, and the possibility of\r\nexercising the most stringent precautions against the introduction of\r\nsepsis from without, abdominal operations presented difficulties only\r\nfaintly appreciated in advance; but this alone scarcely accounted for\r\nthe want of success attending the active treatment of wounds of the\r\nintestine when occasion demanded. Failure was rather to be referred to\r\nthe severity of the local injury to be dealt with, or to the operations\r\nbeing necessarily undertaken at too late a date. Many fatalities, again,\r\nwere due to the association of other injuries, a large proportion of the\r\nwound tracks involving other organs or parts beyond the boundaries of\r\nthe abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nThe frequent association of wounds of the thoracic cavity with those of\r\nthe abdomen afforded many of the most striking examples of immunity from\r\nserious consequences as a result of wound of the pleura. It must be\r\nconceded that in a large number of such injuries only the extreme limits\r\nof the pleural sac were encroached upon, yet in some the tracks passed\r\nthrough the lungs, although without serious consequences. Under the\r\nheading of injury to the large intestine a somewhat special form of\r\npleural septicaemia will be referred to.\r\n\r\nIt may at once be stated that such favourable results as occurred in\r\nabdominal injuries were practically limited to wounds caused by bullets\r\nof small calibre, and that, although in the short chapter dealing with\r\nshell injuries a few recoveries from visceral wounds will be mentioned,\r\nI never met with a penetrating visceral injury from a Martini-Henry or\r\nlarge sporting bullet which did not prove fatal.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the abdominal wall._--It is somewhat paradoxical to say that\r\nthese injuries possessed special interest from their comparative rarity\r\nof occurrence, since they were not of intrinsic importance. Their\r\ninfrequency depended on the difficulty of striking the body in such a\r\nplane as to implicate the belly wall alone, and their interest in the\r\ndiagnostic difficulty which they gave rise to.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the position of the openings and the strongly oval or\r\ngutter character possessed by them were sufficient proof of the\r\nsuperficial passage of the bullet; in others we had to bear in mind that\r\nthe position of the patient when struck was rarely that of rest in the\r\nsupine position, in which the surgical examination was made, and\r\nconsiderable difficulty arose. Some superficial tracks crossing the\r\nbelly wall have already been referred to in the chapter on wounds in\r\ngeneral and in that dealing with injuries to the chest, in which the\r\nabove characters sufficed to indicate that penetration of the abdominal\r\ncavity had not occurred. In other instances a definite subcutaneous\r\ngutter could be traced, and often in these a well-marked cord in the\r\nabdominal wall corresponding to the track could be felt at a later date.\r\nAgain, limitation to the abdominal wall was sometimes proved by the\r\nposition of the retained bullet, or sometimes by the presence in the\r\ntrack of foreign bodies carried in with the projectile. See case 160.\r\n\r\nFig. 84 illustrates an example where the limitation to the abdominal\r\nwall was evident on inspection. Here the division of the thick muscles\r\nof the abdominal wall had led to the formation of a swelling exactly\r\nsimilar to that seen after the subcutaneous rupture of a muscle, and two\r\nsoft fluctuating tumours bounded by contracted muscle existed in the\r\nsubstance of the oblique and rectus muscles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Wound of Abdominal Wall (Lee-Metford). Division\r\nof fibres of external oblique and rectus abdominis muscles. Case 159]\r\n\r\nThe cases which presented the most serious diagnostic difficulty in this\r\nrelation were those in which the wound was situated in the thicker\r\nmuscular portions of the lower part of the abdominal and pelvic walls.\r\nSuch a case is illustrated in the chapter on fractures (see fig. 55, p.\r\n191). I saw one or two such instances, in which only the exploration\r\nnecessary for treatment of the fracture decided the point. In many of\r\nthe wounds affecting the lateral portion of the abdominal wall the\r\nquestion of penetration could never be definitely cleared up, as wounds\r\nof the colon sometimes gave rise to absolutely no symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn a certain proportion of the injuries the peritoneal cavity was no\r\ndoubt perforated without the infliction of any further visceral injury,\r\nand in these also the doubt as to the occurrence of penetration was\r\nnever solved.\r\n\r\n     (158) _Wound of belly wall._--Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_\r\n     (Mauser), 2 inches below the centre of the left iliac crest;\r\n     _exit_, 1-1/2 inch above and internal to the left anterior\r\n     superior iliac spine. The patient was on horseback at the time\r\n     of the injury and did not fall; he got down, however, and lay\r\n     on the field an hour, whence he was removed to hospital.\r\n     Probably the track pierced the ilium, and remained confined to\r\n     the abdominal wall. There were no signs of visceral injury.\r\n\r\n     (159) Cape Boy. Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_ (Lee-Metford),\r\n     immediately above and outside right anterior superior spine;\r\n     _exit_, 1-1/2 inch below and to right of umbilicus. A\r\n     well-marked swelling corresponded with division of the fibres\r\n     of the oblique muscles and of the rectus, and on palpation a\r\n     hollow corresponding with the track was felt. The abdominal\r\n     muscles were exceptionally well developed (fig. 84).\r\n\r\n     (160) Wounded at Magersfontein while lying prone. _Entry_,\r\n     irregular, oblique, and somewhat contused, over the eighth left\r\n     rib, in the anterior axillary line; _exit_, a slit wound\r\n     immediately above and to the left of the umbilicus. The bullet\r\n     struck a small circular metal looking-glass before entering,\r\n     hence the irregularity of the wound. The patient developed a\r\n     haemothorax, but no abdominal signs; the former was probably\r\n     parietal in origin, secondary to the fractured rib, and the\r\n     whole wound non-penetrating as far as the abdominal cavity was\r\n     concerned.\r\n\r\n     (161) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1-1/2 inch\r\n     external to and 1/2 inch below the left posterior superior\r\n     iliac spine; _exit_, 1 inch internal horizontally to the left\r\n     anterior superior spine.\r\n\r\n     No signs of intra-peritoneal injury were noted, but free\r\n     suppuration occurred in left loin; the ilium was tunnelled.\r\n\r\n     The same patient was wounded by a Jeffrey bullet in the hand;\r\n     the third metacarpal was pulverised, although the bullet, which\r\n     was longitudinally flanged, was retained.\r\n\r\n     (162) Wounded outside Heilbron. _Entry_, below the eighth right\r\n     costal cartilage; _exit_, below the eighth cartilage of the\r\n     left side. The wound of entry was slightly oval; that of exit\r\n     continued out as a 'flame'-like groove for 2 inches. A week\r\n     later the wound track could be palpated as an evident hard\r\n     continuous cord.\r\n\r\n_Penetration of the intestinal area without definite evidence of\r\nvisceral injury._--This accident occurred with a sufficient degree of\r\nfrequency to obtain the greatest importance, both from the point of view\r\nof diagnosis and prognosis, and as affecting the question of operative\r\ninterference. Amongst the cases reported below a number occurred in\r\nwhich it was impossible to settle the question whether injury to the\r\nbowel had occurred or not, and I will here shortly give what explanation\r\nI can for the apparent escape of the intestine from serious injury.\r\n\r\nWe may first recall the general question of the escape of structures\r\nlying to one or other side of the track of the bullet. I believe that\r\nthere can be no doubt as to the accuracy of the remarks already made as\r\nto the escape of such structures as the nerves by means of displacement,\r\nand that the occurrence of such escapes is manifestly dependent on the\r\ndegree of fixity of the nerve or the special segment of it implicated.\r\nThe general tendency of the tissues around the tracks to escape\r\nextensive destruction from actual contusion has also been referred to,\r\nand is, I think, indisputable.\r\n\r\nIf these observations be accepted, I think there can be no difficulty in\r\nallowing that the small intestine is exceptionally well arranged to\r\nescape injury. First of all, it is very moveable; secondly, it is so\r\narranged that in certain directions a bullet may pass almost parallel to\r\nthe long axis of the coils; thirdly, it is elastic, capable of\r\ncompression, and light, and hence offers but a small degree of\r\nresistance to the passage of the bullet across the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nCertain evidence both clinical and pathological supports the contention\r\nthat the small intestine may escape injury from the passing bullet.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the fact may be broadly stated that injuries to the small\r\nintestine were fatal in the great majority of certainly diagnosed cases,\r\nwhile, on the other hand, many tracks crossed the area occupied by the\r\nsmall intestine without serious symptoms of any kind resulting.\r\nSecondly, experience showed that when the bullet crossed the line of the\r\nfixed portions of the large intestine the gut rarely escaped, and that,\r\nalthough a considerable proportion of these cases recovered\r\nspontaneously, in a large number of them immediate symptoms, or\r\nsecondary complications, clearly substantiated the nature of the\r\noriginal injury. As far as my experience went, however, I never saw any\r\ninstance in which an undoubted injury of the small intestine was\r\nfollowed by the development of a local peritoneal suppuration and\r\nrecovery, a sequence by no means uncommon in the case of wounds of the\r\nlarge intestine. Although, therefore, I am not prepared to deny the\r\npossibility of spontaneous recovery from an injury to the small\r\nintestine, under certain conditions which will be stated later, I\r\nbelieve that in the immense majority of cases in which a bullet crossed\r\nthe small intestine area without the supervention of serious symptoms,\r\nthe small intestine escaped perforating injury.\r\n\r\nBeyond the clinical evidence offered above, certain pathological\r\nobservations support the view that the intestine escapes perforation by\r\ndisplacement. Most of my knowledge on this subject was derived from the\r\nlimited number of abdominal sections I performed on cases of injury to\r\nthe small intestine, and may be summed up as follows.\r\n\r\nThe small intestine may present evidence of lateral contusion in the\r\nshape of elongated ecchymoses, either parallel, oblique, or transverse\r\nto its long axis. These ecchymoses resemble in extent and outline those\r\nwhich ordinarily surround a wound of the intestinal wall produced by a\r\nbullet (see fig. 87, p. 418).\r\n\r\nThe wall of the small intestine may be wounded to an extent short of\r\nperforation, either the peritoneal coat alone being split, or the wound\r\nimplicating the muscular coat and producing an appearance similar to\r\nthat seen when the intestine is dragged upon during an operation, but\r\nwithout so much gaping of the edges (see fig. 85, p. 416).\r\n\r\nI met with these conditions in association with co-existing complete\r\nperforations of the small intestine, and in one case of intra-peritoneal\r\nhaemorrhage in which no complete perforation was discoverable (No. 169,\r\np. 432).\r\n\r\nThe implication and perforation of the small intestine are to some\r\nextent influenced by the direction of the wound. A striking case is\r\nincluded below, No. 201, in which a bullet passed from the loin to the\r\niliac fossa on each side of the body, approximately parallel to the\r\ncourse of the inner margin of the colon, and I also saw some other\r\nwounds in this direction in which no evidence of injury to the small\r\nintestine was detected, and which got well. Again wounds from flank to\r\nflank were, as a rule, very fatal; but I saw more than one instance\r\nwhere these wounds were situated immediately below the crest of the\r\nilium, in which the intestine escaped injury (see case 171). A very\r\nstriking observation was made by Mr. Cheatle in such a wound. The\r\npatient died as a result of a double perforation of both caecum and\r\nsigmoid flexure; none the less the bullet had crossed the small\r\nintestine area without inflicting any injury.\r\n\r\nThe sum of my experience, in fact, was to encourage the belief that,\r\nunless the intestine was struck in such a direction as to render lateral\r\ndisplacement an impossibility, the gut often escaped perforation.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the wounds of the abdomen which from their position proved\r\nthe most dangerous to the intestine were--\r\n\r\n1. Wounds passing from one flank to the other were very dangerous, as\r\ncrossing complicated coils of the small intestine, and two fixed\r\nportions of the colon. This danger was most marked when the wounds were\r\nsituated between the eighth rib in the mid axillary line and the crest\r\nof the ilium; above this level the liver, or possibly liver and stomach,\r\nwere sometimes alone implicated, and the cases did well. Again, when the\r\nwounds crossed the false pelvis the patients sometimes escaped all\r\ninjury to viscera.\r\n\r\n2. Antero-posterior wounds in the small intestine area were very fatal\r\nif the course was direct; in such the small intestine seldom escaped\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n3. Wounds with a certain degree of obliquity from anterior wall to\r\nflank, or from flank to loin, were on the other hand comparatively\r\nfavourable, as the small intestine often escaped, and if any gut was\r\nwounded, it was often the colon.\r\n\r\n4. Vertical wounds implicating the chest and abdomen, or the abdomen and\r\npelvis, were on the whole not very unfavourable. For instance, when the\r\nbullet entered by the buttock and emerged below the umbilicus, a number\r\nof patients escaped fatal injury; this depended on the comparatively\r\ngood prognosis in wounds of the rectum and bladder. A good many\r\npatients in whom the bullet entered by the upper part of the loin, and\r\nescaped 1-1/2 inch within the anterior superior spine of the ilium, also\r\ndid well. The same holds good when the wounds either entered or emerged\r\nunder the anterior costal margin of the thorax, either prior to or after\r\ntraversing the thorax.\r\n\r\nWounds passing directly backward from the iliac regions were in my\r\nexperience very unfavourable; but I believe mainly as a result of\r\nhaemorrhage from the iliac arteries.\r\n\r\n_The occurrence of wounds of the abdomen of an 'explosive'\r\ncharacter._--The vast majority of the abdominal wounds observed in the\r\nStationary or Base hospitals were of the type dimensions. A certain\r\nnumber of the abdominal injuries which proved fatal on the field or\r\nshortly afterwards were described as explosive in character, and were\r\nreferred by the observers to the employment of expanding bullets.\r\n\r\nA few words on this subject seem necessary, because it seems doubtful\r\nwhether such injuries could be produced by any of the forms of expanding\r\nbullet of small calibre in use, unless the track crossed one of the\r\nbones in the abdominal or pelvic wall. That this was sometimes the case\r\nthere is no doubt: thus I saw two cases in which the splenic flexure of\r\nthe colon was wounded, in which the external opening was large, and a\r\ncomminuted fracture of the ribs of the left side existed. One can well\r\nbelieve that bullets passing through the pelvic bones might 'set up' to\r\na considerable extent, and although I never happened to see such a case,\r\nan explanation of some of the wounds described by others might be found\r\nin this occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn instances in which the soft parts alone were perforated, I am\r\ndisinclined to believe that bullets of small calibre, either regulation\r\nor soft-nosed, were responsible for the injuries. I had the opportunity\r\nof examining two Mauser bullets of the Jeffreys variety which crossed\r\nthe abdomen and caused death. In the first (figured on page 94, fig. 40)\r\nvery little alteration beyond slight shortening had occurred. In the\r\nsecond the deformity was almost the same, except that the side of the\r\nbullet was indented, probably from impact with some object prior to its\r\nentry into the body. In each case the bullet was of course travelling at\r\na low rate of velocity; hence no very strong inference can be drawn\r\nfrom either. In the case of the second specimen, which was removed by\r\nMr. Cheatle, a remarkable observation was made, which tends to throw\r\nsome light on one possible mode of production of large exit apertures.\r\nThis bullet crossed the caecum, making two small type openings; but\r\nlater, when it crossed the sigmoid flexure, it tore two large irregular\r\nopenings in the gut. This might be explained on the ground that the\r\nvelocity was so small as only just to allow of perforation, which\r\ntherefore took the nature of a tear. I am inclined to suggest, as a more\r\nlikely explanation, that the spent bullet turned head over heels in its\r\ncourse across the abdomen, and made lateral or irregular impact with the\r\nlast piece of bowel it touched. A slightly greater degree of force would\r\nhave allowed a similar large and irregular opening to be made in the\r\nabdominal wall also.\r\n\r\nIn this relation the question will naturally be raised as to how far the\r\nexplosive appearances may have been due to high velocity alone on the\r\npart of the bullet. I am disinclined from my general experience to\r\nbelieve that explosive injuries of the soft parts were to be thus\r\nexplained. On the other hand, I believe that the possession of a low\r\ndegree of velocity very greatly increased the danger in abdominal\r\nwounds. I believe that the bowel was, under these circumstances, less\r\nlikely to escape by displacement, and was more widely torn when wounded;\r\nagain, that inexact impact led to increase of size in the external\r\napertures, and the bullet was of course more often retained.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson Cheyne[19] published a very remarkable instance of one of the\r\ndangers of an injury from a spent bullet, in which, in spite of\r\nnon-penetration of the abdominal cavity, the small intestine was\r\nruptured in two places.\r\n\r\nI believe the majority of the wounds designated as explosive were the\r\nresult of the passage of large leaden bullets, either of the\r\nMartini-Henry or Express type. The small opportunity of observing such\r\ninjuries in the hospitals of course depended on the fact that the\r\nmajority were rapidly fatal.\r\n\r\n_Nature of the anatomical lesion in wounds of the intestine._--The\r\nopenings in the parietal peritoneum tended to assume the slit or star\r\nforms, probably on account of the elasticity of the membrane. A diagram\r\nof one of these forms is appended to fig. 89. In this instance the\r\nopening in the peritoneum was made from the abdominal aspect, prior to\r\nthe escape of the bullet from the cavity, and on the impact of the tip,\r\nthe long axis of the bullet was oblique to the surface of the abdominal\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nIn the intestinal wall the openings varied in character according to the\r\nmode of impact.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the gut was merely contused by lateral contact of the\r\npassing bullet. The result of this was evidenced later by the presence\r\nof localised oval patches of ecchymosis. These were identical in\r\nappearance with the patches shown surrounding the wounds in fig. 87.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Lateral Slit in Small Intestine produced by\r\npassage of bullet. Slit somewhat obscured by deposition of inflammatory\r\nlymph. (St. Thomas's Hospital Museum)]\r\n\r\nMore forcible lateral impact produced a split of the peritoneum, or of\r\nthis together with the muscular coat. Such a lateral slit is shown in\r\nfig. 85, although the clearness of outline is somewhat impaired by the\r\npresence of a considerable amount of inflammatory lymph.\r\n\r\nFig. 86 exhibits a lateral injury of a more pronounced form. The bullet\r\nhere struck the most prominent portion of the under surface of the\r\nbowel, and produced a circular perforation not very unlike one produced\r\nby rectangular impact, except in the lesser degree of eversion of the\r\nmucous membrane. Here again the appearance is somewhat altered by the\r\npresence of a considerable amount of lymph, but this is of less\r\nimportance in this figure because the lymph is localised to the portion\r\nof the bowel in the immediate neighbourhood of the opening which had\r\nsuffered contusion and erasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Gutter Wound of Small Intestine caused by\r\nlateral impact. Position of shallow portion of gutter indicated by\r\ndeposition of inflammatory lymph. Circular perforation. (St. Thomas's\r\nHospital Museum)]\r\n\r\nFig. 87, A B, illustrates a symmetrical perforation of the small\r\nintestine; the aperture of entry (A) is roughly circular, and a ring of\r\nmucous membrane protrudes and partially closes the opening. The aperture\r\nof exit is a curved slit, again partially occluded by the mucous\r\nmembrane. The same amount of difference between the two apertures did\r\nnot always exist; in many cases both were circular, and apparently\r\nsymmetrical. Beyond this I have seen three apertures in close proximity,\r\ntwo lying on the same aspect of the bowel, and the first of these was no\r\ndoubt an opening due to lateral impact similar to that seen in fig. 86.\r\nIn the recent condition little difference existed between the three\r\napertures.\r\n\r\nThe localised ecchymosis surrounding the apertures is quite\r\ncharacteristic of this form of injury, and is a valuable aid to finding\r\nthe openings during an operation.\r\n\r\nFig. 88 shows the interior of the same segment of bowel, as fig. 87. It\r\nshows the localised ecchymosis as seen from the inner surface, here\r\nrather more extensive from the fact that the blood spreads more readily\r\nin the submucous tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Perforating Wounds of Small Intestine. A.\r\nEntry; note circular outline and eversion of mucous membrane. B. Wound\r\nof exit; curved slit-like character, eversion of mucous membrane. Note\r\nthe localised ecchymosis, more abundant round exit aperture. (St.\r\nThomas's Hospital Museum)]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the main feature of the form of injury is the\r\nregular outline and the small size of the wounds. Another feature not\r\nillustrated by the figures should also be mentioned. In the ruptures of\r\nintestine with which we are acquainted in civil practice the wound in\r\nthe gut is almost without exception situated at the free border of the\r\nbowel, but in these injuries it was just as frequently at the mesenteric\r\nmargin. The importance of this factor is considerable, since wounds\r\nnear the mesenteric edge are much more likely to be accompanied by\r\nhaemorrhage, and thus the opportunity for diffusion of infection is\r\nconsiderably multiplied, to say nothing of the danger from loss of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nBeyond these more or less pure perforations, long slits or gutters were\r\noccasionally cut. I saw instances of these in the case of the ascending\r\ncolon, and in the small curvature of the stomach. The comparative fixity\r\nof the portion of bowel struck is a matter of great importance in the\r\nproduction of this form of injury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--The same piece of Intestine as that shown in\r\nfig. 87, laid open to show the ecchymosis on the inner aspect of the\r\nBowel. The two indicating lines lead to the openings, which appear\r\nslit-like, and are sunk at the bottom of folds. (St. Thomas's Hospital\r\nMuseum)]\r\n\r\nIt may be well to add that, although the figures inserted are all taken\r\nfrom small-intestine wounds, the nature of the wounds of the\r\nperitoneum-clad part of the large intestine in no way differed from\r\nthem, except in so far as fixity of the bowel exposed it to a more\r\nextensive wound when the bullet took a parallel course to its long axis.\r\n\r\nA more important point in the injuries to the large intestine was the\r\npossibility of an extra-peritoneal wound. I saw several such lesions of\r\nthe colon, every one of which ended fatally. I became still more fully\r\nconvinced of the greater seriousness of extra- to intra-peritoneal\r\nrupture of this portion of the gut than I was when I expressed a similar\r\nopinion in a former paper.[20] It will be seen later that the results of\r\nintra- and extra-peritoneal wounds of the bladder fully confirm this\r\nview, as all extra-peritoneal injuries died, while many intra-peritoneal\r\nperforations recovered spontaneously.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the mesentery._--I had little experience of this injury; in\r\nfact, case 169, on which I operated, was my sole observation. It stands\r\nto reason, however, that injuries to the mesentery would be much more\r\nfrequent proportionately to wounds of the gut than is the case in the\r\nruptures seen in civil practice, since the whole area of the mesentery\r\nis equally open to injury. Viewing the extreme danger of haemorrhage into\r\nthe peritoneal cavity in these injuries, I should be inclined to expect\r\nthat a considerable proportion of those deaths from abdominal wounds\r\nwhich took place on the field of battle were due to this source.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the omentum._--Here, again, I am unable to express any\r\nopinion, although the supposition that haemorrhage from this source took\r\nplace is natural.\r\n\r\nProlapse of omentum was comparatively rare, except in cases with large\r\nwounds; it was apparently seen with some frequency among patients who\r\ndied rapidly on the field of battle. I only saw it twice, and on each\r\noccasion in shell wounds. The wounds from small-calibre bullets were as\r\na rule too small to allow of external prolapse.\r\n\r\nFig. 89, however, illustrates a very interesting observation. A patient\r\nin the German Ambulance in Heilbron, under Dr. Flockemann, died as a\r\nresult of suppuration and haemorrhage secondary to an injury to the\r\ncolon. At the autopsy a portion of the omentum was found adherent in the\r\nwound of exit, but it had not reached the external surface. The chief\r\ninterest of the observation lies in the light it throws on the mechanism\r\nof these injuries. It is impossible to conceive that a small-calibre\r\nbullet coming into direct contact with the omentum could do anything but\r\nperforate it. It, therefore, appears clear that in a displacement like\r\nthat figured, only lateral impact occurred with the omentum, which was\r\ncarried along by the spin and rush of the bullet into the canal of exit,\r\nwhere it lodged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Great Omentum carried by the bullet into an\r\nexit track leading from the abdominal cavity. A. Outline of opening in\r\nthe peritoneum]\r\n\r\n_Results of injury to the intestine._ 1. _Escape of contents and\r\ninfection of the peritoneal cavity._--I think there is little special to\r\nbe said on this subject. The escape of contents into the peritoneal\r\ncavity was by no means free, unless the injury was multiple. Thus in one\r\ncase of injury to the small intestine, No. 166, on which I operated,\r\nthere was absolutely no gross escape until the bowel was removed from\r\nthe abdominal cavity, when the contents spurted out freely. In one case\r\nof very oblique injury to the colon there was a considerable quantity of\r\nfaecal matter in a localised space, but as a rule the ordinary condition\r\nbest described as 'peritoneal infection' from the wound was found. The\r\nbad effect of anything like free escape was well shown in multiple\r\nperforations; in these suppurative peritonitis rapidly developed and the\r\npatients died at the end of thirty-six hours or less. A typical case is\r\nquoted in No. 168.\r\n\r\n2. _Peritoneal infection, and general septicaemia._--As is evident from\r\nthe results quoted among the cases, the degree which this reached varied\r\ngreatly. It may of course be assumed that in some measure it occurred in\r\nevery case in which the bowel was perforated, but it was sometimes so\r\nslight as to be scarcely noticeable. This may be said to have been most\r\ncommon in injuries to the large intestine. Wounds of the caecum,\r\nascending and descending colon, the sigmoid flexure, or the rectum, were\r\nsometimes followed by no serious symptoms, either local or general.\r\nAgain in these portions of the bowel the development of local signs, and\r\nthe later formation of an abscess, were by no means uncommon.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the small intestine I never observed this sequence, and\r\nthe same may be said of the transverse colon, which in its anatomical\r\narrangement and position so nearly approximates to the small bowel. In\r\nsuspected wounds of these portions of the bowel either the symptoms were\r\nso slight as to render it doubtful whether a perforation had occurred,\r\nor marked signs of general peritoneal septicaemia developed, and death\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the peritoneum in fatal cases varied much. In some a\r\ndry peritonitis, or one in which a considerable quantity of slightly\r\nturbid fluid was effused, was found. In others a rapid suppurative\r\nprocess, accompanied by the effusion of large quantities of plastic\r\nlymph, was met with. My experience suggested that the latter condition\r\nwas the result of free infection from multiple wounds of the gut, the\r\nformer the accompaniment of single wounds. Hence I should ascribe the\r\ndifference mainly to the extent of the primary infection.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps a suitable place to further discuss the explanation of\r\nthe escape of a considerable number of the patients who received wounds\r\nof the abdomen, possibly implicating the bowel. Although this was not, I\r\nthink, so common an occurrence as has been sometimes assumed, yet many\r\nexamples were met with. Several reasons have been advanced.\r\n\r\n(1) Great importance has been given to the fact that many of the men\r\nwere wounded while in a state of hunger, no food having been taken for\r\ntwelve or more hours before the reception of the injury. In view of the\r\nwell-proved fact in these, as in other intestinal injuries, that free\r\nintestinal escape does not occur, and that it is usually a mere question\r\nof infection, this explanation, in my opinion, is of small importance.\r\nIt might with far more justice be pointed out that many of these wounded\r\nmen were for them in the happy position of not having friends freely\r\ndosing them with brandy and water after the reception of the injury, and\r\nthis was possibly an element of some importance.\r\n\r\nSome of the men did, however, drink freely, and in one case which\r\nterminated fatally a comrade gave a man wounded through the belly an\r\nimmediate dose of Beecham's pills.\r\n\r\n(2) Mr. Treves has suggested that the effect of the severe trauma on the\r\nmuscular coat of the bowel is to cause a cessation of peristaltic\r\nmovement. This, as in the case of 'local shock' elsewhere, may no doubt\r\nbe of importance, and to it should be added the simultaneous cessation\r\nof abdominal respiratory movements in the segment of the belly wall\r\ncovering the injured part. The occurrence of general cessation of\r\nperistaltic movement is, however, to some extent opposed by the fact\r\nthat in a certain number of the cases early passage of motions was seen\r\njust as happens in the intestinal ruptures seen in civil practice.\r\n\r\nI should be inclined to ascribe the escape from serious infection in\r\nthese injuries to the same cause which accounts for their comparative\r\ninsignificance in other regions--namely, the small calibre of the bullet\r\nand consequent small size of the lesion: in point of fact to the minimal\r\nnature of the primary infection. I very much doubt if any patient who\r\nhad more than one complete perforation of the small intestine got well\r\nduring the whole campaign. This opinion is, moreover, supported by the\r\nfact that the prognosis was so far better in cases of injury to the\r\nlarge than to the small intestine, in which former segment of the bowel\r\nwe have the advantages of a position beyond the region in which\r\nintestinal movement is most free, the unlikelihood of multiple injury,\r\nand a drier and more solid type of faecal contents.\r\n\r\nIn the instances in which recovery followed perforating injuries without\r\nany bad signs we can only assume a minimal infection, and sufficient\r\nirritation and reaction on the part of the bowel to produce rapid\r\nadhesion between contiguous coils, and thus provisional closure.\r\n\r\nThe other mode of spontaneous recovery which I saw several times take\r\nplace in the injuries to the large bowel consisted in the limitation of\r\nthe spread of infection by early adhesions and the development of a\r\nlocal abscess. The non-observance of this process in any case of injury\r\nto the small intestine raises very great doubts in my mind as to the\r\nfrequent recovery of patients in whom the small intestine was\r\nperforated.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE INTESTINAL TRACT\r\n\r\n1. _Wounds of the stomach._--A considerable number of wounds in such a\r\nsituation as to have possibly implicated the stomach were observed, and\r\nof these a certain number recovered spontaneously. The only two\r\ninstances that came under my own observation are recorded below. It will\r\nbe noted that in each the special symptoms were the classic ones of\r\nvomiting and haematemesis. In the first case blood was also passed per\r\nanum, and in the second the diagnosis was reinforced by the escape of\r\nstomach contents from the external wound.\r\n\r\nThe second case was a surgical disappointment. No doubt the fatal issue\r\nwas mainly dependent on the fact that the external wound had to be kept\r\nopen to allow of the escape of the abundant discharge from the wounded\r\nliver. In the absence of the hepatic wound, however, I believe it would\r\nhave been possible for this patient to have got well spontaneously, in\r\nview of the firm adhesions which had formed around the opening in the\r\nstomach, and the consequent localisation which had been effected.\r\nAnother unfortunate element in this case was the comminuted fracture of\r\nthe seventh costal cartilage, which maintained the patency of the\r\naperture of exit. The latter point, however, was of doubtful importance\r\nfrom this aspect, as the vent provided for the gastric and biliary\r\nsecretions may have been the safety-valve that had allowed localisation\r\nto develop.\r\n\r\nI believe that the secondary haemorrhage was the main element in robbing\r\nus of a success in this case, and that this depended on the digestion of\r\nthe wound by the gastric secretion. The early troubles which arose in\r\nthe treatment of this patient well illustrate the difficulties by which\r\nthe military surgeon is at times met; but the patient was admirably\r\nattended to and nursed by my friend Mr. Pershouse, and an orderly who\r\nwas specially put on duty for the purpose.\r\n\r\n     (163) Wounded at Rensburg. _Entry_ (Mauser), in ninth left\r\n     intercostal space in posterior axillary line; _exit_, a\r\n     transverse slit 1/2 an inch in length to left of xiphoid\r\n     appendage. Patient was retiring when struck; he did not fall,\r\n     but ran for about 1,000 yards, whence he was conveyed to\r\n     hospital. He vomited half an hour after the injury (last meal\r\n     bread and 'bully beef,' taken two hours previously), and during\r\n     the evening three times again, the vomit consisting mainly 'of\r\n     dark thick blood.' He was put on milk diet, and not completely\r\n     starved; on the third day a large quantity of dark clotted\r\n     blood was passed per rectum with the stool, and this continued\r\n     for two days.\r\n\r\n     Ten days after the injury the temperature was still rising to\r\n     100 deg., and did not become normal till the fourteenth day. The\r\n     pulse averaged 80. The abdomen, meanwhile, moved fairly well,\r\n     respirations 18 to 20. Some tenderness was present in the\r\n     epigastrium and towards the spleen. Resonance throughout.\r\n     Ordinary diet was now resumed, and beyond slight epigastric\r\n     pain on deep inspiration, no further symptoms were observed,\r\n     and the patient left for England at the end of the month. The\r\n     spleen may have been traversed in this patient, as well as the\r\n     lower margin of the right lung.\r\n\r\n     (164*) Wounded at Enslin. _Entry_ (Mauser), 3/4 of an inch from\r\n     the spine, opposite the eighth intercostal space; _exit_,\r\n     through the seventh left costal cartilage, 1 inch from the\r\n     median line. The patient was lying in the prone position when\r\n     shot: he vomited blood freely, and the bowels acted three times\r\n     before he was seen forty hours after the accident, each motion\r\n     containing dark blood.\r\n\r\n     On the commencement of the third day the patient's expression\r\n     was extremely anxious, and he was suffering great pain. Pulse\r\n     96, temperature 100 deg.. Tongue moist, occasional vomiting, bowels\r\n     open yesterday. Has taken fluid nourishment since injury. The\r\n     abdomen moved with respiration, but was moderately distended,\r\n     especially in the line of the transverse colon; it was\r\n     tympanitic on percussion, there was no dulness in the flanks,\r\n     and only moderate rigidity of the wall on palpation. Frothy\r\n     fluid stained with bile and faecal in odour was escaping from\r\n     the wound of exit, and the everted margins of the latter were\r\n     bile-stained.\r\n\r\n     A vertical incision was carried downwards from the wound for 4\r\n     inches. A rugged furrow was found on the under surface of the\r\n     left lobe of the liver; the stomach was contracted and firmly\r\n     adherent by recent lymph to the under surface of the liver and\r\n     the diaphragm. The transverse colon was much distended. On\r\n     separating the stomach a slit wound was found at the lesser\r\n     curvature, immediately to the right of the oesophagus. This\r\n     wound was closed with some difficulty with two tiers of\r\n     sutures; the cavity was mopped out, and then irrigated with\r\n     boiled water; a plug was introduced along the line of the\r\n     furrow in the liver, and the lower part of the abdominal\r\n     incision closed.\r\n\r\n     The patient stood the operation well, and was removed to his\r\n     tent; during the day, however, two thunder showers occurred\r\n     during each of which water, several inches if not a foot deep,\r\n     rushed through the camp. After the second flood he was removed\r\n     to the operating room, the only house we had, and slept there.\r\n     The pulse rose to 120, and respiration to 26, and there was\r\n     pain, which was subdued by 1/3 grain of morphia, administered\r\n     subcutaneously. A fair amount of urine was passed, and the\r\n     bowels acted once, the motion containing blood.\r\n\r\n     On the second day after operation there was some improvement;\r\n     the pulse still numbered 116, and the temperature was raised to\r\n     100 deg., but the belly moved fairly, and pain was moderate.\r\n     Abundant foul-smelling, bile-stained discharge came from the\r\n     wound when the plug was removed. Rectal feeding was\r\n     supplemented by small quantities of milk and soda by the mouth.\r\n\r\n     The condition did not materially change, but on the fourth day\r\n     it was evident that the suturing of the stomach wound had given\r\n     way, and liquid food escaped readily when taken. The discharge\r\n     remained bile-stained and very foul. No extension of\r\n     inflammation to the general peritoneal cavity occurred, but it\r\n     was evident that the patient was suffering from constitutional\r\n     infection from the foul wound, the lower part of which opened\r\n     up somewhat after the removal of the stitches on the seventh\r\n     day. The wound was irrigated three times daily with 1-300\r\n     creolin lotion, but remained very foul. The man slowly lost\r\n     strength, although escape from the stomach considerably\r\n     decreased. On the tenth day a sudden severe haemorrhage\r\n     occurred, presumably from a large branch of the coeliac axis.\r\n     The bleeding was readily controlled by a plug, and did not\r\n     recur; but the patient rapidly sank, and died on the twelfth\r\n     day after the operation, and fourteen days after reception of\r\n     the injury. No _post-mortem_ examination was made.\r\n\r\n2. _Wounds of the small intestine._--These were comparatively common,\r\nbut offered little that was special either in their symptoms or the\r\nresults attending them. Wounds were met with in every part of the small\r\ngut; but I saw no case in which an injury to the duodenum could be\r\nspecially diagnosed.\r\n\r\nAs to the symptoms which attended these injuries, it is somewhat\r\ndifficult to speak with precision, and it must be left to my readers to\r\nform an opinion as to how many of the cases recounted below were really\r\ninstances of perforating wounds. My own view is that in the majority of\r\nthe cases that got well spontaneously, the injury was not of a\r\nperforating nature, and that for reasons which have been already set\r\nforth. It will, however, be at once noted that in all the five cases in\r\nwhich the injury was certainly diagnosed in hospital death occurred.\r\n\r\nThe cases of injury to the small intestine are perhaps best arranged in\r\nthree classes.\r\n\r\n1. Those who died upon the field, or shortly after removal from it. In\r\nthese the external wounds were often large, the omentum was not rarely\r\nprolapsed, and escape of faeces sometimes occurred early. Shock from the\r\nseverity of the lesion, and haemorrhage, were no doubt important factors\r\nin the early lethal issue in this class. Many of the injuries were no\r\ndoubt produced by bullets striking irregularly, by ricochets, by bullets\r\nof the expanding forms, or by bullets of large calibre. As being beyond\r\nthe bounds of surgical aid, this class possessed the least interest.\r\n\r\n2. Cases brought into the Field, or even the Stationary hospitals, with\r\nsymptoms of moderate severity, or even of an insignificant character,\r\nin which evidence of septic peritonitis suddenly developed and death\r\nensued.\r\n\r\n3. Cases in which the position of the wounds raised the possibility of\r\ninjury to the intestine, but in which the symptoms were slight or of\r\nmoderate severity, and which recovered spontaneously.\r\n\r\nThe whole crux in diagnosis lay in the attempt to separate the two\r\nlatter classes, and, personally, I must own to having been no nearer a\r\nposition of being able to form an opinion on this point, in the late\r\nthan in the early stage of my stay in South Africa. The advent of\r\nperitoneal septicaemia was in many instances the only determining moment.\r\nOn this matter I can only add that, in civil practice, an exploratory\r\nabdominal section is often the only means of determination of a rupture\r\nof the bowel wall.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the cases of suspected injury to the bowel which\r\nrecovered spontaneously, the symptoms were somewhat special in their\r\ncomparative slightness, and in the limited nature of the local signs.\r\nThus the pulse seldom rose to as much as 100 in rate, 80 was a common\r\naverage. Respiration was never greatly quickened, 24 was a common rate.\r\nThe temperature rarely exceeded 100 deg.. Vomiting was occasionally severe,\r\nbut usually not persistent, ceasing on the second day. A good quantity\r\nof urine was passed. As to the local signs, these again were of a\r\nlimited nature; distension did not occur, or was slight; movement of the\r\nabdominal wall was only restricted in the neighbourhood of the wound,\r\nthe affected area amounted to a quarter, or at most half, the abdominal\r\nwall, and rigidity was localised to a similar segment. Local tenderness\r\nusually existed; but, as a rule, there was little or no dulness to point\r\nto the occurrence either of fluid effusion or a considerable deposition\r\nof lymph.\r\n\r\nAgain many of the patients suffered with very slight symptoms of\r\nconstitutional shock, although there was considerable variation in this\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n     (165*) Wounded at Graspan, sustaining a compound fracture of\r\n     the fibula. While being carried off the field, a second bullet\r\n     (Lee-Metford) entered immediately outside the left posterior\r\n     superior iliac spine, perforated the pelvis, and emerged 1-1/2\r\n     inch within the left anterior superior spine. The patient was\r\n     then put down and left on the field ten hours; later he was\r\n     carried to shelter for the night, and arrived at Orange River\r\n     on the second day. He suffered with some pain in the abdomen,\r\n     especially during the journey in the train, but was not sick;\r\n     the bowels were confined.\r\n\r\n     When seen on the third day at 6 P.M., some pain was complained\r\n     of in the abdomen, which moved freely in the upper part, but\r\n     was motionless below the umbilicus. No distension. Tenderness\r\n     around wound of exit and some rigidity. The bowels had acted\r\n     four times during the day; motions loose, dark brown, and\r\n     containing no blood. Face not anxious, eyes bright, temperature\r\n     102 deg.. Pulse 96, regular, and of good strength. Tongue moist and\r\n     little furred.\r\n\r\n     The abdomen was opened at 5 A.M. on the fourth day, as the\r\n     local signs had become more pronounced, and the patient had\r\n     passed a restless night in great abdominal pain. A local\r\n     incision was chosen, as the wound was presumably in the sigmoid\r\n     flexure. The sigmoid flexure was adherent to the abdominal wall\r\n     opposite the wound of exit, and a dark ecchymosed patch was\r\n     found, but no perforation could be detected. Foul pus and gas\r\n     escaped freely from the pelvis, but no wound of the large bowel\r\n     could be discovered here. On enlarging the incision upwards\r\n     three openings were found in a coil of jejunum, probably that\r\n     about five feet from the duodenal junction usually provided\r\n     with the longest mesentery. No fourth opening could be found.\r\n     The openings were circular, about 1/3 inch in diameter, clean\r\n     cut, with a ring of everted mucous membrane, and the wall of\r\n     the bowel in the neighbourhood was thickened. All three\r\n     openings were included within a length of 2-1/2 inches. There\r\n     was no surrounding ecchymosis of the bowel wall. Very little\r\n     escaped intestinal contents were found in the situation of the\r\n     bowel. The latter had apparently been retracted upwards, and\r\n     lay to the left of the lumbar spine. The wounds were readily\r\n     closed by five Lembert's sutures, three crossing the openings,\r\n     and one at each end. The belly was then washed out with boiled\r\n     water and closed. The delay in finding the wounds due to the\r\n     mistaken impression that they would be found in the pelvis\r\n     materially prolonged the operation, which lasted an hour and a\r\n     half. The patient never rallied, and died seventeen hours\r\n     later. It is possible that a wound in the sigmoid flexure was\r\n     present which had already closed at the time of operation.\r\n\r\n     (166*) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), opposite\r\n     central point of left ilium; _exit_, 1-1/2 inch above the\r\n     centre of the right Poupart's ligament. Vomiting commenced soon\r\n     after the injury, and this was continuous until the patient's\r\n     arrival in the Stationary hospital on the fourth day, when the\r\n     condition was as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Face extremely anxious in expression. Temperature 101 deg.,\r\n     sweating freely. Pulse 110, fair strength. Tongue moist.\r\n     Abdomen much distended, rigid, motionless, tympanitic\r\n     throughout. Bowels confined. No urine had been passed for\r\n     twenty-four hours, [Symbol: ounce]ij in bladder on\r\n     catheterisation, clear, and containing no blood.\r\n\r\n     Abdominal section. Median incision. A considerable quantity of\r\n     bloody effusion was evacuated. Intestine generally congested\r\n     and distended. No lymph. Two wounds were found in the ileum on\r\n     the opposite sides of one coil; the openings were circular,\r\n     with the mucous membrane everted. No escape of faecal matter was\r\n     visible until the intestine was delivered, when intestinal\r\n     contents spurted freely across the room. The openings were\r\n     sutured with five Lembert's stitches. The bowel was punctured\r\n     in two places to relieve distension, and then returned into the\r\n     belly, after washing with boiled water.\r\n\r\n     Four pints of saline solution were infused into the median\r\n     basilic vein, and 1/30 grain strychnine sulph. was injected\r\n     hypodermically.\r\n\r\n     The patient did not rally, and died twelve hours after the\r\n     operation.\r\n\r\n     (167*) Wounded at Graspan. _Entry_ (Lee-Metford), midway\r\n     between the umbilicus and pubes; _exit_, 1 inch to the left of\r\n     the fifth lumbar spine. The patient was seen on the third day\r\n     in the following condition: in great pain, expression extremely\r\n     anxious, vomiting constantly. Pulse 150 running, respirations\r\n     48. Temperature 100 deg., sweating freely. Great distension,\r\n     rigidity, and general tenderness of immobile abdomen. No\r\n     improvement followed the administration of brandy and\r\n     hypodermic injection of strychnine 1/30 grain, and operation\r\n     was deemed hopeless.\r\n\r\n     In the evening the patient was apparently dying. Face blue and\r\n     sunken and covered with sweat, eyes dull, speechless, pulse\r\n     imperceptible, restlessness extreme, bowels acting\r\n     involuntarily, no urine in bladder.\r\n\r\n     The man was placed in a tent by himself, and to my surprise was\r\n     alive and better the next morning; the expression was still\r\n     anxious, but the face brighter and not sweating; the pulse\r\n     only numbered 100, but was very weak, and the hands and feet\r\n     were cold. The condition of the abdomen was unaltered, but the\r\n     thoracic respiration had decreased in rapidity from 48 to 28.\r\n\r\n     His condition still seemed to preclude any chance of successful\r\n     intervention, but none the less life was retained until the\r\n     morning of the seventh day, the state alternating between a\r\n     moribund one and one of slight improvement. He was lucid at\r\n     times, although for the most part wandering, and was so\r\n     restless that no covering could be kept upon him. Vomiting was\r\n     continuous, so that no nourishment could be retained; the\r\n     bowels acted frequently involuntarily, and little or no urine\r\n     was passed. Meanwhile, the abdomen became flat, then sunken, an\r\n     area of induration and tenderness about 6 inches in diameter\r\n     developing around the wound of entry. Slight variations in the\r\n     pulse, and from normal to subnormal in the temperature, were\r\n     noted, and death eventually occurred from septicaemia and\r\n     inanition.\r\n\r\n     (168*) Wounded at Driefontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), above the\r\n     posterior third of the left iliac crest, at the margin of the\r\n     last lumbar transverse process (probably through ilio-lumbar\r\n     ligament); _exit_, 1 inch below and to the left of the\r\n     umbilicus.\r\n\r\n     The patient was wounded at 3 P.M., but not brought into the\r\n     Field hospital until 9 P.M., when the temperature of the tents\r\n     was below 28 deg.F. He was considerably collapsed, suffering much\r\n     pain, and vomited freely. The abdomen was flat, but very\r\n     tender. Bowels confined. The column had to move at 5 A.M. the\r\n     next morning, when the temperature was still near freezing, and\r\n     during the day continuous fighting prevented any chance of\r\n     operation. The man steadily sank during the day, and died\r\n     thirty-six hours after the reception of the injury.\r\n\r\n     _Post-mortem condition._--Belly not distended, dull anteriorly\r\n     in patches, and right flank dull throughout. When the belly was\r\n     opened, extensive adhesion of omentum and intestine enclosing\r\n     numerous collections of pus were disclosed, and on disturbing\r\n     the adhesions a large collection of turbid blood-stained fluid\r\n     was set free from the right loin. The great omentum was much\r\n     thickened and matted, with deposition of thick patches of\r\n     lymph; very firm recent adhesions also united numerous coils of\r\n     small intestine. The pus was foetid, but no appreciable\r\n     quantity of intestinal contents was detected in it. The lower\r\n     half or more of the small intestine was injected, reddened, and\r\n     thickened. The wounds which were situated in the lower part of\r\n     the jejunum and ileum were multiple, and seven perforations\r\n     were detected; besides these the intestine was marked by\r\n     bruises, and some gutter slits affecting the serous and\r\n     muscular coats only. Considerable ecchymosis surrounded these\r\n     latter. The clean perforations were circular, less than 1/4\r\n     inch in diameter, and for the most part closed by eversion of\r\n     the mucous membrane. Intestinal contents were not apparent, but\r\n     escaped freely on manipulation of the bowel.\r\n\r\n     (169*) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), over the\r\n     eighth rib in the anterior axillary line; _exit_, 1 inch to the\r\n     left of second lumbar spinous process, just below the last rib.\r\n     Vomiting commenced almost immediately after reception of the\r\n     injury, and the bowels acted frequently. This condition\r\n     persisted until the fourth day, when the patient was brought\r\n     down to Orange River, and the signs were as follows.\r\n     Considerable pain in left half of abdomen, pulse 110, fair\r\n     strength, temperature 101 deg.. Some general distension of abdomen\r\n     with complete disappearance of hepatic dulness. Some movement\r\n     of right half of abdomen, left half immobile, dulness extending\r\n     from the flank as far forwards as linea semilunaris. An\r\n     incision was made in left linea semilunaris, and Oj blood\r\n     evacuated from the left loin. There was no lymph on the\r\n     intestines nor sign of inflammation. No perforation was\r\n     discovered in either stomach or intestine, but on two coils of\r\n     jejunum there were deep slits 3/4 inch long, extending through\r\n     both peritoneal and muscular coats. Beyond these wounds, on\r\n     other coils oval patches of ecchymosis, due to direct bruising,\r\n     were present. The peritoneal cavity was sponged free of all\r\n     blood and irrigated with boiled water; no bleeding point was\r\n     discovered, and the abdomen was closed.\r\n\r\n     The next morning the patient was comfortable; temperature\r\n     100.2 deg., pulse 100. Tongue clean and moist; he vomited once\r\n     during the night.\r\n\r\n     Some bloody discharge had collected in the dressing, and at the\r\n     lower angle of wound there was a local swelling, apparently in\r\n     the abdominal wall. The flank was resonant.\r\n\r\n     During the afternoon the patient became faint, and when seen at\r\n     6 P.M. was in a state of collapse, in which he shortly died.\r\n\r\n     Death was apparently due to renewal of the previous haemorrhage.\r\n     No _post-mortem_ examination was made.\r\n\r\n     (170*) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1/2 inch to\r\n     the left of the second sacral spine; _exit_, immediately below\r\n     the left anterior superior iliac spine; the patient was\r\n     kneeling at the time, and the same bullet traversed his left\r\n     thigh in the lower third. When seen on the third day, the\r\n     lower part of the abdomen was motionless, tumid, and tender.\r\n     The bowels had been confined for three days; there had been no\r\n     sickness, and the tongue was moist and clean. Temperature 100 deg.,\r\n     pulse 90, fair strength, respirations 38. The patient had once\r\n     had an attack of acute appendicitis, and he himself said he was\r\n     sure he now had 'peritonitis,' as he had pain exactly similar\r\n     in the belly to that he had suffered in his previous illness.\r\n\r\n     No further signs, however, developed under an expectant\r\n     treatment, and he remained some two months in hospital, while\r\n     the wound in the thigh and a third injury to the elbow-joint\r\n     were healing.\r\n\r\n     (171) _Entry_ (Mauser), at the highest point of the left crista\r\n     ilii; _exit_, through the right ilium, 2 inches horizontally\r\n     anterior to the posterior superior spine. Absolutely no\r\n     abdominal symptoms followed. The bowels were confined five\r\n     days, and then opened by enema. The patient complained of some\r\n     stiffness in the lumbo-sacral region, but the right\r\n     synchondrosis was no doubt implicated in the track.\r\n\r\n     (172) Wounded at Paardeberg (range 800 yards). _Entry_\r\n     (Mauser), 2 inches diagonally below and to the right of the\r\n     umbilicus; _exit_, not discoverable. For the first two days the\r\n     patient had to lie out with the regiment; on the fourth he was\r\n     removed to the Field hospital. During the first three days the\r\n     patient vomited (green matter) frequently, and the belly was\r\n     hard and painful; as biscuit was the only available food, no\r\n     nourishment was taken. The bowels acted on the second night. At\r\n     the end of a week the patient was sent by bullock wagon (three\r\n     days and nights) to Modder River, and then down to Capetown,\r\n     where he walked into the hospital on the thirteenth day,\r\n     apparently well.\r\n\r\n     Two days later the temperature rose to 104 deg., and enteric fever\r\n     was diagnosed, no local signs pointing to the injury existing.\r\n     The patient made a good recovery.\r\n\r\n     (173) Wounded at Colenso. _Entry_ (Mauser), at junction of\r\n     outer 2/5 with inner 3/5 of line from right anterior superior\r\n     iliac spine to umbilicus; _exit_, at upper part of right great\r\n     sacro-sciatic foramen, in line of posterior superior iliac\r\n     spine. Advancing on foot when struck; he then fell and crept\r\n     fifty yards to behind a rock, where he remained seven and a\r\n     half hours. For two days subsequently he vomited freely; the\r\n     bowels acted nine hours after the injury, and then became\r\n     constipated. No further symptoms were noted, and at the end of\r\n     three weeks the abdomen was absolutely normal. The man is now\r\n     again on active service.\r\n\r\n     (174*) Wounded at Modder River while retiring on foot. _Entry_\r\n     (Mauser), at highest point of right iliac crest; _exit_, 2-1/2\r\n     inches to right of and 1/2 inch above level of umbilicus. The\r\n     injury was not followed by sickness, and the bowels remained\r\n     confined. During the first two days 'pain struck across the\r\n     abdomen' when micturition was performed.\r\n\r\n     When the patient came under observation on the third day the\r\n     condition was as follows:--Complains of little pain,\r\n     temperature normal, pulse 72, respirations 24, tongue moist,\r\n     bowels confined. Rigidity of abdominal wall and deficient\r\n     mobility of nearly whole right half of belly, the whole lower\r\n     half of which moves little with respiration. No track palpable\r\n     in abdominal parietes. No dulness, no distension. The\r\n     temperature rose to 99.5 deg. at night. On the fourth day the\r\n     bowels acted freely, the pulse fell to 60, the respirations\r\n     were 24, and the temperature normal.\r\n\r\n     Tenderness and rigidity persisted in the right flank to the end\r\n     of a week, after which time no further signs persisted.\r\n\r\n     (175*) Wounded at Modder River while lying on right side. Range\r\n     500 yards. Walked 400 yards after injury. _Entry_ (Mauser), at\r\n     the junction of the posterior and middle thirds of the right\r\n     iliac crest; _exit_, 3 inches to right of and 1/2 inch below\r\n     the level of the umbilicus. The injury was followed by no signs\r\n     of intra-abdominal lesion; on the third day the temperature was\r\n     normal, pulse 80, and the tongue clean and moist. Some soreness\r\n     at times and tenderness on pressure were complained of, but the\r\n     man was discharged well at the end of one month.\r\n\r\n     (176*) Wounded while doubling in retirement at Modder River.\r\n     _Entry_ (Mauser), immediately above the junction of the\r\n     posterior and middle thirds of the left iliac crest; _exit_, 1\r\n     inch below costal margin (eighth rib), 3 inches to the right of\r\n     the median line. The bullet was lying in the anterior wound,\r\n     whence it was removed by the orderly who applied the first\r\n     dressing on the field. The patient remained on the field seven\r\n     and a half hours, and when brought into hospital at once\r\n     commenced to vomit. The ejected matter, at first green in\r\n     colour, during the next forty-eight hours changed to a dirty\r\n     brown. Meanwhile, the abdomen was somewhat painful. When seen\r\n     on the third day he had ceased to vomit for three hours. The\r\n     face was slightly anxious, and the patient lay on the ground\r\n     with the lower extremities extended. Temperature 99 deg., pulse 72,\r\n     fair strength. Respirations 32, shallow. Tongue moist, lightly\r\n     furred, bowels not open for four days. He slept fairly last\r\n     night. Abdomen soft, moving well with respiration, no\r\n     distension, slight tenderness below and to the right of the\r\n     umbilicus, and local dulness in right flank.\r\n\r\n     The next day the pulse fell to 60 and the bowels acted, but\r\n     there was no change in the local condition. The man looked\r\n     somewhat ill until the end of a week, but was then sent to the\r\n     Base, and at the expiration of a month was sent home well.\r\n\r\n     (177*) Wounded at Modder River. Two apertures of _entry_\r\n     (Mauser); (_a_) below cartilage of eighth rib in left nipple\r\n     line; (_b_) 2 inches below and 4-1/2 inches to the left of the\r\n     median line. No exit wound discovered, and no track could be\r\n     palpated between the two openings, which were both circular and\r\n     depressed. When seen on fourth day there was tenderness in the\r\n     lower half of the abdomen, and the left thigh was held in a\r\n     flexed position. Respirations 20, respiratory movement confined\r\n     to upper half of abdominal wall. Pulse 70, temperature 99 deg..\r\n     Tongue moist, covered with white fur; bowels confined since the\r\n     accident; no sickness. The patient remained under observation\r\n     thirteen days, during which time pain and difficulty in\r\n     movement of the left thigh persisted, also slight tenderness in\r\n     the lower part of the abdomen; but at the end of a month he was\r\n     sent to England well, but unfit to take further part in the\r\n     campaign. I thought the bullet might be in the left psoas, but\r\n     it was not localised.\r\n\r\n     (178*) Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_ (Mauser), 3-1/2 inches\r\n     above and 1-1/2 inch within the left anterior superior iliac\r\n     spine; _exit_, 1-1/2 inch to the right of the tenth dorsal\r\n     spinous process. The same bullet had perforated the forearm\r\n     just above the wrist prior to entering the abdomen. No local or\r\n     constitutional signs indicated either bowel injury or\r\n     perforation of liver. The man, however, was suffering from a\r\n     slight attack of dysentery, passing blood and mucus per rectum\r\n     with great tenesmus. He was sent to the Base at the end of a\r\n     week, and returned to England well three weeks later. He\r\n     attributed his dysentery to the wound, as the symptoms did not\r\n     exist prior to its reception; but as the disease coincided\r\n     exactly with what was very prevalent amongst the troops at the\r\n     time, I do not think there was any connection between it and\r\n     the injury.\r\n\r\n     (179) Wounded near Thaba-nchu. _Entry_, over the centre of the\r\n     sacrum at the upper border of fourth segment; _exit_, 1-1/2\r\n     inch above left Poupart's ligament, 2 inches from the median\r\n     line. Aperture of entry oval, with long vertical axis. Exit\r\n     wound a transverse slit, with slight tendency to starring (see\r\n     fig. 19, p. 58). One hour after being shot the patient vomited\r\n     once. There was some evidence of shock and considerable pain.\r\n     The bowels acted involuntarily simultaneously with the\r\n     vomiting, and incontinence of faeces and retention of urine\r\n     persisted for four days. The vomit was bilious in appearance;\r\n     no blood was seen either in it or the motions.\r\n\r\n     Forty-six hours after the injury the condition was as follows:\r\n     Face slightly anxious and pale; skin moist, temperature 100.4 deg.;\r\n     pulse 116, regular and of fair strength; respirations 24;\r\n     abdomen slightly tumid; tenderness over lower half, especially\r\n     on left side; the lower half moves little with respiration.\r\n\r\n     Twenty-four hours later the patient had improved. He was\r\n     comfortable and hopeful; slept well with morphia 1/3 grain\r\n     hypodermically. Tongue moist, covered with white fur; has been\r\n     taking milk only, [Symbol: ounce]ij every half-hour. No\r\n     sickness. Temperature\r\n\r\n     99 deg.. Pulse 104. Respirations 24. Abdomen flatter; general\r\n     respiratory movement; tenderness now mainly localised to an\r\n     area 2-1/2 inches in diameter, to the left of the umbilicus,\r\n     above exit wound.\r\n\r\n     The patient continued to improve, and on the fifth day\r\n     travelled six hours in a bullock wagon to Bloemfontein. Soon\r\n     after arrival his temperature was normal: pulse 80,\r\n     respirations 16, with good abdominal movement. Local tenderness\r\n     persisted in the same area, but was less in degree. Tongue\r\n     rather dry, bowels confined. Micturition normal. Two drachms of\r\n     castor oil and an enema were given.\r\n\r\n     On the ninth day patient was practically well, except for\r\n     slight deep tenderness. He remained in bed on ordinary light\r\n     diet, but at the end of the third week he was seized by a\r\n     sudden attack of pain, the temperature rising to 103 deg. and the\r\n     pulse to 140, the abdomen becoming swollen and tender. He was\r\n     then under the charge of Mr. Bowlby, who ordered some opium,\r\n     and the symptoms rapidly subsided. Although this wound crossed\r\n     the small intestine area, it is probable that the symptoms may\r\n     have been due to an injury of the rectum or sigmoid flexure.\r\n\r\n3. _Wounds of the large intestine._--Injuries to every part of the large\r\nbowel were observed, and spontaneous recoveries were seen in all parts\r\nexcept the transverse colon, which, as already remarked, is near akin\r\nto the small intestine with regard to its position and anatomical\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nThe only case of perforation of the vermiform appendix that I heard of,\r\none under the care of Mr. Stonham, died of peritoneal septicaemia.\r\nSeveral cases of recovery from wounds of the caecum and ascending colon\r\nare recounted below. The only points of importance in the nature of the\r\nsigns of these injuries were their primary insignificance, and the\r\ncomparative frequency with which _local_ peritoneal suppuration followed\r\nthem. The absence of a similar sequence in some of the cases in which\r\nwounds of the small intestine were assumed, was, in my opinion, one of\r\nthe strongest reasons for doubting the correctness of the diagnosis. It\r\nis also a significant fact that injuries of the ascending colon--that is\r\nto say, of the portion of the large bowel which perhaps lies most free\r\nfrom the area occupied by the small intestine--were those which most\r\nfrequently recovered.\r\n\r\nThe following cases afford examples of the course followed in a number\r\nof injuries to the large intestine, and illustrate both the\r\nuncomplicated and the complicated modes of spontaneous recovery.\r\n\r\nNo. 180 affords a good example of an extra-peritoneal injury, and of the\r\nespecially fatal character of such lesions. This case was also one of my\r\nsurgical disappointments.\r\n\r\nNos. 182, 183 are of great interest in several particulars. First, the\r\naperture of exit was large and allowed the escape of faeces, not a very\r\ncommon feature in wounds not proving immediately fatal. Secondly, in\r\nneither were any peritoneal signs observed. Thirdly, in each the exit\r\nwound communicated with the pleura, and the patients died from\r\nsepticaemia mainly due to absorption from the surface of that membrane\r\n(_Pleural septicaemia_).\r\n\r\nNo. 190 is a most striking instance of spontaneous cure, since no doubt\r\ncan exist that both rectum and bladder were perforated.\r\n\r\n     (180*) _Injury to the caecum and ascending colon._--Boer,\r\n     wounded at Graspan while sheltering behind a rock, lying on his\r\n     back.\r\n\r\n     _Entry_ (Lee-Metford), in right thigh, 3 inches below and 1\r\n     inch within anterior superior spine of ilium; _exit_, in back,\r\n     on a level with the fourth lumbar spinous process and 3 inches\r\n     from that point.\r\n\r\n     Half an hour after the wound the patient commenced to suffer\r\n     severe stabbing pain; he lay on the field one hour; later he\r\n     was taken to a Field hospital, and on the second day was sent\r\n     by train a distance of twenty-five miles.\r\n\r\n     When seen at the end of fifty hours the condition was as\r\n     follows. Face anxious, complexion dusky. Great abdominal pain,\r\n     especially about the umbilicus. Vomiting frequent and\r\n     distressing; bowels confined since the accident; tongue dry and\r\n     furred. Urine scanty. Pulse full and strong, 125; respirations,\r\n     entirely thoracic, 30.\r\n\r\n     Abdomen generally distended and tympanitic, wall rigid and\r\n     motionless. Dulness in right flank, together with superficial\r\n     oedema and emphysema.\r\n\r\n     Abdominal section fifty-three and a half hours after accident.\r\n     Incision in right linea semilunaris. Great omentum adherent to\r\n     ascending colon, which was covered with plastic lymph. Gas and\r\n     intestinal contents escaped from an opening at the line of\r\n     reflexion of the peritoneum from the ascending colon;\r\n     retro-peritoneal extravasation and emphysema extended the whole\r\n     length of the ascending colon and around duodenum, the wall of\r\n     the colon itself exhibiting subperitoneal emphysema. The colon\r\n     was freed and the rent sewn up with interrupted sutures. About\r\n     [Symbol: ounce] iv of foul faecal fluid were evacuated from\r\n     loin, and a free counter-opening made. The opening in the ilium\r\n     by which the bullet had entered the abdomen was found at the\r\n     brim of the pelvis; the loin and peritoneal cavity were sponged\r\n     dry and flushed with boiled water; no lymph was seen on the\r\n     small intestine. A large gauze plug was inserted into the\r\n     posterior wound, one end of the plug being brought out of the\r\n     operation incision.\r\n\r\n     During the succeeding six days progress was not unsatisfactory:\r\n     the abdomen became soft, moved with respiration, there was no\r\n     sickness, and the bowels acted. The pulse fell to 90,\r\n     respirations to 20, and the temperature did not exceed 102 deg. F.\r\n     The wound suppurated freely, however, and although there were\r\n     no further signs of peritoneal septicaemia, it was evident that\r\n     general infection had taken place, and on the sixth day a\r\n     parotid bubo developed on the right side, which was opened.\r\n\r\n     On the seventh day the patient suddenly commenced to fail\r\n     rapidly; vomiting was almost continuous--at first curdled milk,\r\n     later frothy watery fluid--and on the eighth day he died. The\r\n     abdomen remained soft, sunken, and flaccid, and death no doubt\r\n     resulted from general septicaemia rather than from peritoneal\r\n     infection, absorption taking place from the large foul cavity\r\n     behind the colon. As the cavity in part surrounded the\r\n     descending duodenum, this possibly accounted for the attack of\r\n     vomiting which preceded death.\r\n\r\n     (181*) _Ascending colon._--Wounded at Graspan while lying in\r\n     prone position. _Entry_ (Mauser), over ninth rib in line of\r\n     right linea semilunaris; _exit_, in right buttock, just below\r\n     and behind the top of the great trochanter.\r\n\r\n     The injury was followed by little abdominal pain, but a strange\r\n     sensation of local gurgling was noted. The bowels acted as soon\r\n     as the patient reached camp, some hours after being wounded.\r\n     There was no sickness and nothing abnormal was noted in the\r\n     motions, except that they were loose and light-coloured.\r\n\r\n     On the evening of the third day the patient came under\r\n     observation in the ambulance train for Capetown. He looked\r\n     somewhat anxious and ill, but he complained of little pain; the\r\n     temperature was 102 deg., pulse 88, fair strength, soft and\r\n     regular. There was local dulness, tenderness, and deficiency of\r\n     movement in the right iliac region. As it was night, he was\r\n     removed from the train and an operation was performed the next\r\n     morning.\r\n\r\n     Prior to operation the condition was as follows: Pulse 84,\r\n     temperature 100 deg.; respiration easy, 20. Tongue moist, but\r\n     thickly coated in centre. Abdomen moves fairly, and is\r\n     resonant, except in right lower quadrant. No distension.\r\n     Dulness, tenderness, and rigidity in right iliac region, marked\r\n     to outer side of caecum. Entry wound nearly and exit quite\r\n     healed. Cannot flex right thigh. The following operation was\r\n     performed. Appendix incision, about [Symbol: ounce]j of faecal\r\n     fluid and faeces in a localised cavity on outer and anterior\r\n     aspect of caecum evacuated; adhesions very firm. Cavity sloughy\r\n     throughout and caecum covered with dull grey lymph. The opening\r\n     in the bowel was not localised, and it was considered wiser to\r\n     treat the case like one of perforation from appendicitis than\r\n     to run the risk of breaking down adhesions. A small awl-like\r\n     opening was found in the ilium with powdered bone at its\r\n     entrance leading to the wound of exit.\r\n\r\n     The after-treatment of the case gave rise to no anxiety, but\r\n     healing of the resulting sinus was slow; faecal-smelling pus\r\n     escaped for some days, and a number of small sloughs came away.\r\n     On the twelfth day the patient was sent down to Wynberg, where\r\n     he remained twelve weeks. A counter-incision was needed in the\r\n     loin to drain the suppurating cavity three weeks after the\r\n     primary operation, and five weeks after the operation an escape\r\n     of gas and faeces took place from the anterior wound, while the\r\n     bowels were acting, as a result of a dose of castor oil. No\r\n     further escape of faeces occurred, and he left for England with\r\n     a small sinus only. No extension of inflammation into the\r\n     original wound track ever occurred, both openings and the canal\r\n     healing by primary union.\r\n\r\n     The sinus remained open, and occasionally discharged for a\r\n     further period of six months, and then healed firmly; since\r\n     when the patient has been in perfect health.\r\n\r\n     (182*) _Splenic flexure, descending colon._--Wounded at\r\n     Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), in sixth left intercostal\r\n     space in mid-axillary line; _exit_, in left loin, below last\r\n     rib, at outer margin of erector spinae. The patient remained in\r\n     the Field hospital three days, during which time he exhibited\r\n     no serious abdominal symptoms, but during the journey to Orange\r\n     River (53-1/2 miles) he was sick. He remained at Orange River\r\n     two days, and while there an enema was administered, producing\r\n     a normal motion. The abdomen was slightly distended; it moved\r\n     fairly, there was slight rigidity, but little tenderness.\r\n     Temperature 100.8 deg., pulse 120. No appearance of faeces in wound.\r\n\r\n     When seen on the sixth day the condition was as\r\n     follows:--Patient cheerful and not in great pain. Temperature\r\n     99.2 deg.; pulse 120; respirations 48, very shallow. Abdomen soft,\r\n     moving freely, no distension or general tenderness. Fluid faeces\r\n     escaping in abundance from the wound in loin. Redness of skin\r\n     and swelling below level of wound, and cellular emphysema\r\n     above. Faecal-smelling fluid was also escaping from the thoracic\r\n     wound.\r\n\r\n     The wound was enlarged, but the patient rapidly sank, and died\r\n     of septicaemia on the seventh day.\r\n\r\n     (183*) An exactly similar case came under observation from the\r\n     battle of Modder River, except that the opening in the loin was\r\n     somewhat larger, and earlier and freer escape of faeces took\r\n     place from it. In this also faecal matter passed freely into the\r\n     left pleural cavity, and faecal matter was expectorated, while\r\n     there was an almost complete absence of abdominal symptoms.\r\n     Death occurred on the fourth day.\r\n\r\n     No _post-mortem_ examination was made in either case, but I\r\n     believe in both the extra-peritoneal aspect of the colon was\r\n     implicated and that the septicaemia was in great part due to\r\n     absorption from the pleural rather than the peritoneal cavity,\r\n     since in neither case were the abdominal symptoms a prominent\r\n     feature.\r\n\r\n     (184) _Possible wound of caecum._--Wounded at Spion Kop. Bullet\r\n     (Mauser) perforated the right forearm, then entered belly.\r\n     _Entry_, 3 inches from the right anterior superior iliac spine,\r\n     in the line of the supra-pubic fold of the belly wall (a\r\n     transverse slit); _exit_, in right buttock, on a level with the\r\n     tip of the great trochanter and 2 inches within it. The wound\r\n     was received immediately after breakfast had been eaten. There\r\n     was retention of urine and constipation for three days, but no\r\n     sickness. Local pain and tenderness were severe, and at the end\r\n     of three weeks there was still local tenderness, slight\r\n     induration, and dragging pain on defaecation. The patient\r\n     returned to England at the end of a month well, except for\r\n     slight local tenderness.\r\n\r\n     (185) _Possible wound of colon._--Wounded at Paardeberg; range\r\n     200 yards. Walking at time. The bullet (Mauser) perforated the\r\n     left forearm, just below the elbow-joint. _Entry_, into belly 1\r\n     inch anterior to the tip of the left eleventh costal cartilage;\r\n     no exit.\r\n\r\n     The injury was followed by pain in the left half of the abdomen\r\n     and vomiting, which continued for two days. The bowels acted on\r\n     the third day; no nourishment was taken for two days, but a\r\n     small quantity of water was allowed. No further symptoms were\r\n     noted, and at the end of a fortnight the patient was well,\r\n     except for slight local tenderness. The bullet could not be\r\n     detected with the X-rays.\r\n\r\n     (186) _Wound of caecum_.--Wounded at Paardeberg. _Entry_\r\n     (Mauser), 2 inches diagonally above and within right anterior\r\n     superior iliac spine; _exit_, immediately to the right of the\r\n     fifth lumbar spinous process; the patient was lying on his left\r\n     side when struck. A burning pain down the right thigh\r\n     immediately followed the accident, and lasted some days. There\r\n     was no sickness, the bowels were confined three days, and there\r\n     was pain across the back and down the thigh.\r\n\r\n     On the tenth day he arrived at the Base, when he was lying on\r\n     his back suffering considerable pain. The temperature ranged to\r\n     101 deg.. There was diarrhoea and cystitis, with a considerable\r\n     amount of pus in the urine, which was very offensive. A small\r\n     fluctuating spot existed on the back, just to the right of the\r\n     original exit wound which was firmly healed. The abdomen moved\r\n     fairly with respiration in its upper part, but was motionless\r\n     below, especially in the right iliac fossa; some induration was\r\n     to be felt here. The right thigh was kept flexed.\r\n\r\n     During the next few days the pus disappeared from the urine,\r\n     and with this change the induration in the right iliac fossa\r\n     increased. An incision (Mr. Gairdner) was made into the\r\n     fluctuating spot behind, and pus evacuated. The patient\r\n     recovered.\r\n\r\n     (187) _Possible wound of caecum._--Wounded outside Heilbron.\r\n     _Entry_ (Mauser), in the right loin, 2-1/2 inches above the\r\n     iliac crest, at the margin of the erector spinae; _exit_, 1-1/2\r\n     inch above and within the right anterior superior spine of the\r\n     ilium. There was little shock. The patient was brought six\r\n     miles in a wagon into camp, and slept comfortably with a small\r\n     morphia injection. Prior to the accident the patient was\r\n     suffering from diarrhoea, but afterwards the bowels were\r\n     confined. The next morning there had been no sickness and\r\n     little pain. The tongue was moist and clean, the pulse 80, the\r\n     respirations 24, the belly moved generally, although\r\n     inspiration was shallow; the temperature was 99 deg.. Slight\r\n     tenderness in the belly to the inner side of the exit wound,\r\n     but no dulness.\r\n\r\n     The patient was starved for the first thirty-six hours, a\r\n     little warm water then being allowed. No symptoms developed,\r\n     and a perfect recovery followed.\r\n\r\n     (188) _Colon_, _liver_.--Wounded outside Heilbron. _Entry_\r\n     (Mauser), midway between the last right rib and the crista\r\n     ilii; _exit_, below the eighth costal cartilage in nipple line.\r\n     There were no serious primary symptoms, but ten days after the\r\n     accident the temperature rose, swelling and pain developed in\r\n     the right loin, and on the fourteenth day a large tympanitic\r\n     abscess was opened (Dr. Flockemann, German Ambulance.)\r\n     Faecal-smelling gas and pus were evacuated. There was no\r\n     extension of the abscess forwards. A week later the patient had\r\n     much improved, although there were evident signs of general\r\n     absorption, and the discharge from the abscess cavity was\r\n     abundant and very foul. On the thirteenth day a serious\r\n     haemorrhage occurred from the loin wound, which was opened up,\r\n     but no evident source was discovered; haemorrhage was repeated\r\n     the next day, and the man died.\r\n\r\n     At the _post-mortem_ examination a large quantity of\r\n     chocolate-coloured fluid was found free in the abdomen and\r\n     pelvis. A chain of small local abscesses was found surrounding\r\n     the ascending colon, and a larger one over the front of the\r\n     caecum. The wall of the ascending colon was generally thickened,\r\n     and from this, in three places, openings with rounded margins\r\n     connected the abscess cavities with the lumen of the bowel. One\r\n     of the openings, larger than the others, was possibly the\r\n     aperture of entry of the bullet; the others were apparently\r\n     spontaneous.\r\n\r\n     At the anterior border of the right lobe of the liver an\r\n     abscess cavity existed in connection with the wound of the\r\n     liver, and this was continuous with the aperture of exit,\r\n     although not discharging. The aperture of exit was plugged by a\r\n     tag of omentum (see fig. 89). No obvious source of the\r\n     haemorrhage was forthcoming, but it probably originated in one\r\n     of the large branches of the vena cava. The bullet had struck\r\n     the transverse process of the lumbar vertebra, but had not\r\n     given rise to any signs of spinal concussion.\r\n\r\n     (189*) _Ascending colon._--Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_\r\n     (Mauser), midway between the tip of the tenth right rib and the\r\n     iliac crest. Bullet retained. A second wound existed over the\r\n     centre of the left sterno-mastoid, and the bullet here was also\r\n     retained and never localised. The patient stated that he\r\n     brought up blood at short intervals for half an hour\r\n     immediately after he was wounded. This might have been\r\n     explained by the wound in the neck, but no difficulty in\r\n     swallowing was noted. The bowels acted the day after he was\r\n     shot, and, except for some local tenderness and immobility, no\r\n     abdominal signs were noted. Three weeks later a swelling was\r\n     obvious to the right side of the umbilicus, and a tympanitic\r\n     abscess developed; this was opened, and a deformed Mauser\r\n     bullet extracted. Foul pus, but no faecal matter, was evacuated,\r\n     and after discharging for a fortnight the wound closed, and the\r\n     man was sent home as 'well.' In this case I assumed a wound of\r\n     the ascending colon had occurred.\r\n\r\n     (190*) _Rectum and bladder._--Wounded at Graspan, while\r\n     retiring at the double. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1 inch to the right\r\n     of the coccyx; _exit_, 1 inch above the junction of the middle\r\n     and outer thirds of left Poupart's ligament. The man suffered\r\n     with some pain in the abdomen, and for first two days with\r\n     retention of urine. The urine was drawn off with the catheter,\r\n     and contained blood. During the next five days micturition was\r\n     hourly or more frequent; gas was passed _per urethram_, and the\r\n     urine was very foul, containing evident faecal matter.\r\n     Micturition continued frequent, with purulent cystitis for one\r\n     month. Local tenderness, pain, and immobility developed over\r\n     the lower quarter of the abdomen, extending to the right iliac\r\n     fossa. A local abscess pointed a little to the right of the mid\r\n     line, and 2 inches above the symphysis, and from this\r\n     foul-smelling pus, but no faeces, was discharged for three\r\n     months, during which period the surrounding dulness and\r\n     induration gradually decreased and the sinus healed. When the\r\n     patient left for England there was still occasional slight\r\n     discharge from the original wound of entry, and there was\r\n     slight discomfort on micturition, but he was otherwise well.\r\n\r\n     A year later the man had resumed active duty, and, except for\r\n     occasional pain on stooping, considered himself well.\r\n\r\nThe following cases are appended as of some general interest. The first\r\ntwo (191, 192) illustrate extra-peritoneal injuries to the rectum. In\r\nneither did positive evidence exist of wound of the bowel, but the\r\nsymptoms in each rendered this accident probable. Case 193 is an\r\nillustration of apparent escape of the anal canal in a wound in which\r\nfrom the position of the external apertures this escape would have\r\nappeared impossible.\r\n\r\nWounds of the extra-peritoneal portion of the rectum, as a rule,\r\nappeared to have a somewhat better prognosis than would have been\r\nexpected; in any case, the prognosis was far better than that obtaining\r\nin wounds of the base of the urinary bladder. My experience on the\r\nsubject of these wounds was, however, limited to the two cases quoted.\r\n\r\nCase 194 is inserted as an example of the complicated nature of the\r\nabdominal injuries not so very unfrequently met with. It illustrates\r\nwell the difficulty which may arise at any stage in the course of\r\ntreatment of an injury, in the certain determination or exclusion of\r\nwound of a part of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\n     (191) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), in the right\r\n     loin, immediately below the ribs in the mid-axillary line;\r\n     _exit_, about the centre of the left buttock, on a level with\r\n     the tip of the great trochanter. A second lacerated shell wound\r\n     of back was present. All the wounds suppurated. For the first\r\n     sixteen days following the injury all control was lost over the\r\n     anal sphincter, and bloody faeces, and later slime, constantly\r\n     escaped, but no faecal matter ever escaped from the wound in the\r\n     buttock. There was no history of previous dysentery, and rectal\r\n     examination afforded no information. The buttock wound had to\r\n     be opened up, disclosing a tunnel in the ilium.\r\n\r\n     The wounds granulated slowly with continuous suppuration, but\r\n     were healed, and the patient returned home at the end of\r\n     fourteen weeks, the bowels acting normally.\r\n\r\n     (192) Wounded at Paardeberg. _Entry_ (Mauser), at the junction\r\n     of the middle and posterior thirds of the left iliac crest; the\r\n     bullet was retained, and removed (Mr. Pegg) from the back of\r\n     the right thigh, 3 inches below the back of the great\r\n     trochanter. After the injury retention of urine followed, with\r\n     incapacity to control loose motions, though solid ones could be\r\n     retained. The retention was treated by catheterisation, which\r\n     was followed by cystitis. The power of micturition was slowly\r\n     recovered, and three weeks later he could pass water, at times\r\n     in a dribbling stream only; the cystitis had improved. The man\r\n     returned to England very much improved, but not quite well, at\r\n     the end of five weeks.\r\n\r\n     (193) Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_, in the right buttock,\r\n     near the outer border at the upper part; _exit_, at the lower\r\n     part of outer border of left buttock. The line of the wound\r\n     exactly crossed the position of the anus, but no sign of injury\r\n     to the rectum could be discovered.\r\n\r\n     (194) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1/2 inch\r\n     below the margin of the iliac crest, at the junction of its\r\n     middle and posterior thirds, and on a level with the fifth\r\n     lumbar spinous process; _exit_, below the cartilage of the\r\n     eighth rib, just within the left nipple line. Struck while\r\n     retiring; fell at once, and remained thirty hours on the field.\r\n     Patient stated that he vomited 'blood like coffee grounds' six\r\n     times while lying on the field, and twice after being brought\r\n     in. His bowels were confined for three days. His right lower\r\n     extremity was paralysed.\r\n\r\n     On the fifth day there was considerable induration around the\r\n     wound of exit, and the upper half of the abdomen was immobile\r\n     and tender. The temperature rose to 100 deg., and the pulse was 96.\r\n     Shortly afterwards a similar condition was noted in the lower\r\n     half of the abdomen; the temperature continued to be raised and\r\n     the pulse quickened, when on the thirteenth day a considerable\r\n     quantity of pus was passed per rectum, and diarrhoea set in;\r\n     this continued for three days, with marked improvement in the\r\n     general symptoms. Micturition, which had been painful, became\r\n     normal; the pulse and temperature fell, and the expression\r\n     became less anxious. The patient continued to sleep badly,\r\n     however, and complained of pain.\r\n\r\n     At the end of the third week he still looked ill, but was\r\n     easier. Temperature normal in the morning, 100 deg. in evening,\r\n     pulse 80. Tongue thickly furred, but moist. Still on milk diet;\r\n     appetite bad; bowels irregular.\r\n\r\n     The abdomen moved little in the lower half, induration\r\n     persisted in the left iliac fossa, the left thigh continued\r\n     flexed, and resonance was impaired to the left of the\r\n     umbilicus.\r\n\r\n     At the end of six weeks a distinct hard swelling in two parts,\r\n     separated by a resonant area, was noted to the left of the\r\n     umbilicus and in the left iliac fossa. The abdomen moved\r\n     fairly, and there was little tenderness over the swelling.\r\n     During the next week the swelling appeared to increase and to\r\n     fluctuate; at the same time the temperature again began to rise\r\n     to 100 deg. and 101 deg. at eve. The swelling was taken to be a\r\n     localised peritoneal suppuration, and an incision was made over\r\n     it; but this led down to a free peritoneal cavity, with a\r\n     tumour pressing up from the posterior abdominal wall. The wound\r\n     was therefore closed, and a fresh extra-peritoneal incision\r\n     made, immediately above Poupart's ligament, when the swelling\r\n     proved to be a large retro-peritoneal haematoma. As the cavity\r\n     extended into the pelvis and up to the level of the costal\r\n     margin, it was deemed wise only to evacuate a part of the\r\n     blood-clot. The origin of the bleeding was not determined, and\r\n     the wound was closed and healed by first intention. The man\r\n     continued to improve, and left for home five weeks later.\r\n\r\n     This patient has continued to improve since his return, but the\r\n     left thigh is still somewhat flexed.\r\n\r\n_Prognosis in intestinal injuries._--This was of a most discouraging\r\ncharacter compared with the prognosis in abdominal injuries as a whole.\r\nThe cases were of two classes, however: those that died within\r\ntwenty-four hours, and those that died at the end of from three days to\r\na week.\r\n\r\nCases falling into the first category are obviously of little importance\r\nfrom the point of view of surgical treatment. Many of them died from the\r\nwidespread nature of the injury, and the shock produced by it; others\r\nfrom haemorrhage from the large abdominal vessels. It is unlikely that\r\nany could have been saved, even under the most satisfactory conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the following small table, therefore, I have included only the cases\r\nwhich have been already quoted, which survived long enough to be\r\namenable to surgical treatment, and which were for some days under my\r\nown observation. Some of them, in fact almost all, I watched until they\r\nwere either convalescent, or died, and in six I performed operations.\r\n\r\nI am aware, and have short details of the histories of eight patients\r\nwounded in the same battles who died prior to the termination of the\r\nfirst thirty-six hours; but these are not included, for the reason\r\nstated above, and also because I am uncertain whether all the injuries\r\nwere produced by bullets of small calibre.\r\n\r\n-------------------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------+\r\n                         |           | Localised   |           |      |\r\nViscous wounded          | Number of |  Secondary  | Recovered | Died |\r\n                         |    cases  | suppuration |           |      |\r\n                         |           |  occurred   |           |      |\r\n-------------------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------+\r\nStomach certain          |     2     |     --      |     1     |   1  |\r\nStomach possible         |     1     |     --      |     1     |  --  |\r\nSmall intestine certain  |     5     |      0      |    --     |   5  |\r\nSmall intestine possible |    10     |      0      |    10     |  --  |\r\nLarge intestine certain  |     8     |      4[21]   |     4     |   4  |\r\nLarge intestine possible |     4     |     --      |     4     |  --  |\r\n-------------------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------+\r\nBladder certain          |     3     |      3      |     1     |   2  |\r\nBladder possible         |     1     |     --      |     1     |  --  |\r\nLiver                    |     6     |     --      |     6     |  --  |\r\nKidneys                  |     6     |     --      |     4     |   2  |\r\nSpleen                   |     3     |     --      |     2     |   1  |\r\n-------------------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------+\r\n  Total                  |    49[22]  |     --      |    34     |  15  |\r\n-------------------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+------+\r\n\r\nIncluded in the above table are thirty instances of intestinal injury,\r\nand these are divided up according to the segment of the intestinal\r\ncanal implicated, and also as to whether the perforation was certain, or\r\nonly assumed from the position of the external apertures and the\r\npresence of abdominal symptoms of a noticeable grade.\r\n\r\nFrom this analysis it appears clear--\r\n\r\n1. That wounds of the stomach have a comparatively good prognosis, and\r\nthat they may recover spontaneously. It is true that only two examples\r\nare included in my table; but I was at various times shown patients with\r\nsimilar injuries and histories, and a number of cases which have been\r\npublished appear to substantiate the opinion. From our experience of the\r\noccasional spontaneous recovery of gastric perforations from disease, I\r\nthink we might be prepared to expect that the stomach would offer a\r\ncomparatively favourable seat for these wounds. It may be pointed out,\r\nhowever, that haematemesis, the main feature in the symptoms pointing to\r\nwound, is by no means direct proof of more than contusion.\r\n\r\n2. That perforating wounds of the small intestine are very fatal\r\ninjuries; every patient in whom the condition was _certainly_ diagnosed\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n3. That in the cases in which a perforation was inferred from the\r\nposition of the external apertures and the symptoms, not one patient\r\nsuffered from the secondary complications--_e.g._ local peritonitis and\r\nsuppuration, which were common in the case of the large intestine, and\r\nwhich we are accustomed to see after perforation from disease. This\r\nrenders the occurrence of actual perforation in the majority of the\r\ncases a matter of very grave doubt.\r\n\r\nIf spontaneous recovery does take place after this injury, it is only in\r\ncases in which the wounds are single, and slight in character.\r\n\r\n4. That in eight cases in which perforation of the large intestine was\r\ncertain, four recoveries took place; but in each instance suppuration\r\noccurred. I am, however, quite prepared to believe that perforation may\r\nhave occurred in some or all of the other four cases included as\r\n'possible,' provided the wounds were intra-peritoneal.\r\n\r\nWounds of the caecum and ascending colon are those which have the best\r\nprognosis, and after these of the rectum. The comparatively good\r\nprognosis in these parts is what would be expected, on account of their\r\ngreater fixity, and lesser tendency to be covered by the small\r\nintestine.\r\n\r\nAn extra-peritoneal wound of any of these portions of the bowel is more\r\ndangerous than an intra-peritoneal, and more likely to give rise to\r\nsepticaemia.\r\n\r\nOf the cases included in my table eighteen of the possible intestinal\r\ninjuries were observed among the wounded of the four battles of the\r\nKimberley relief force. These cases I saw early and followed to their\r\ntermination, and I believe the list contains the great majority of all\r\nthe patients who received intestinal wounds in those battles. On inquiry\r\nI could not learn of others from the officers of the Field hospitals;\r\nbut no doubt some patients died before their reception into hospital,\r\nand some may have been overlooked; again, I know of two cases in which\r\ndeath took place within the first week, but which went direct to the\r\nBase and did not come under my observation. These exceptions being made,\r\nwe have a fairly complete series, from which some deductions may be\r\ndrawn. The cases included are marked with an asterisk.\r\n\r\nOf the eighteen cases, eight or 44.4 per cent. died. These were made up\r\nas follows:--Stomach, one case; this patient died at the end of fourteen\r\ndays, as a result of secondary haemorrhage and septicaemia. It was\r\ncomplicated by a severe wound of the liver and also one of the lung.\r\n\r\nSmall intestine, four certain cases; all died, two after operation in\r\nthe stage of septicaemia, and one after operation from recurrent\r\nhaemorrhage, possibly from the mesentery. Of the other six cases one can\r\nonly say that the position of the wounds was such as to render wound of\r\nthe intestine possible, and that all suffered with abdominal symptoms of\r\nsome severity.\r\n\r\nLarge intestine. Of six cases in which wound was certain, three died,\r\none after operation. One recovered after operation, two recovered with\r\nlocal peritoneal suppuration. In one case the injury could only be\r\nreturned as possible.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I have received permission from Mr.\r\nWatson Cheyne to quote the statistics published by him[23] concerning\r\nthe abdominal wounds observed after the fighting at Karree Siding, on\r\nMarch 29, which are as follows:--\r\n\r\n     'The number of the wounded was 154, and in fifteen it was\r\n     considered that the abdominal cavity had been penetrated. Of\r\n     these patients, five had already died within twenty-four to\r\n     twenty-eight hours after the injury, and I saw ten who were\r\n     still alive. Of these nine were left alone, and four died\r\n     within the next twenty-four or thirty-six hours; five were\r\n     still alive when I left Karee on Sunday afternoon, April 1. On\r\n     one I operated, but he died on April 2.\r\n\r\n     The Karee statistics are really the only complete ones which I\r\n     have as yet been able to obtain. The following are the notes of\r\n     the cases above alluded to.\r\n\r\n     Besides the five cases of abdominal wounds which had already\r\n     died, and of which I could get no complete details, the\r\n     following ten are cases which I saw from twenty-four to thirty\r\n     hours after they were  shot:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCASES FROM THE ACTION AT KAREE\r\n\r\n     CASE I.--The point of entrance was 2 inches to the right of the\r\n     umbilicus, and the bullet was found lying under the skin far\r\n     back in the left loin. The patient was pulseless, and there was\r\n     much rigidity of the abdomen, tenderness, and vomiting. He died\r\n     a few hours later.\r\n\r\n     CASE II.--The bullet, coming from the side, had entered the\r\n     abdomen 4 inches below and behind the right nipple. There was\r\n     no exit wound. The patient had been vomiting a good deal, but\r\n     not any blood; the abdomen was very rigid and tender. He was\r\n     obviously very ill, and died the next morning. The bullet had\r\n     probably perforated the liver and _stomach_.\r\n\r\n     CASE III.--There was a large wound above the right anterior\r\n     iliac spine (probably the point of exit), and a small opening\r\n     behind and near the spine on the same side. There was great\r\n     tenderness and rigidity of the abdomen. He died a few hours\r\n     later.\r\n\r\n     CASE IV.--In this case there was a transverse wound of the\r\n     abdomen, the bullet having entered on the right side in the\r\n     middle of the lumbar region and passed out on the left side,\r\n     rather higher up and further back. All the symptoms of acute\r\n     peritonitis were present. The patient died the next morning.\r\n\r\n     CASE V.--The bullet had entered the anterior end of the sixth\r\n     intercostal space on the left side, and was found lying under\r\n     the skin over the seventh intercostal space on the right side\r\n     and about 2 inches further back. He had vomited blood on the\r\n     previous day. The bullet may have perforated the _stomach_. The\r\n     epigastrium was somewhat tender, but there were no marked\r\n     symptoms. On April 1 he was going on well.\r\n\r\n     CASE VI.--The place of entrance of the bullet was 1 inch in\r\n     front of the right anterior superior spine, and of exit behind\r\n     the left sacro-iliac synchondrosis. There was much haemorrhage\r\n     at the time. His condition when I saw him was fair, and there\r\n     was no marked abdominal tenderness. On April 1 his morning\r\n     temperature was 101 deg.. There were no signs of general\r\n     peritonitis, and his condition was good.\r\n\r\n     CASE VII.--The bullet had entered from behind, about the tip of\r\n     the twelfth rib on the left side, and had left about the middle\r\n     of the epigastrium, and rather to the left of the middle line.\r\n\r\n     Vomiting was still going on, but not of blood. There was much\r\n     tenderness and rigidity of the abdomen, and he was almost\r\n     pulseless. On April 1 his general condition was better, but the\r\n     abdomen was very rigid and tender. (Subsequently died.)\r\n\r\n     CASE VIII.--The point of entrance of the bullet was about 2\r\n     inches from the anterior end of the seventh left intercostal\r\n     space, and of exit rather lower down and further back on the\r\n     right side. The patient said that he had vomited brown fluid\r\n     after the injury. There was much abdominal pain, but his\r\n     general condition was fair. On April 1 there was still much\r\n     pain, but his general condition was good.\r\n\r\n     CASE IX.--The bullet had entered about 1-1/2 inch in front of\r\n     the anterior inferior spine on the right side, had gone\r\n     directly backwards, and had come out in the buttock. The\r\n     patient, however, suffered very little. On March 31 there was\r\n     slight tympanites and tenderness in the right iliac fossa. The\r\n     bowels acted well, and no blood was passed. On April 1 he was\r\n     very well, and it was considered very doubtful if any viscus\r\n     was wounded.\r\n\r\n     CASE X.--The point of entrance was in the middle of the right\r\n     buttock, a little above the level of the trochanter; the exit\r\n     was through the anterior abdominal wall in the right semilunar\r\n     line at the level of the umbilicus. The patient was decidedly\r\n     ill; the abdomen was a good deal distended, and pressure on it\r\n     caused an escape of gas through the anterior opening. There was\r\n     a good deal of abdominal tenderness and rigidity. I opened the\r\n     abdomen outside the right linea semilunaris, and found a\r\n     perforation in the anterior wall of the _ascending colon_,\r\n     without any adhesions around, which was easily stitched up. The\r\n     posterior opening was found about 2 inches lower down, with a\r\n     piece of omentum firmly adherent to it and completely closing\r\n     it. As the patient was in a bad state, I thought it better,\r\n     instead of excising the piece of intestine beyond the holes or\r\n     tearing off the omentum, to leave the wounds alone, merely\r\n     cleaning out the peritoneal cavity as well as I could and\r\n     arranging for free drainage. He rallied from the operation very\r\n     well, and for twenty-four hours it looked as if he might get\r\n     better; but he gradually got worse and died on April 2.'\r\n\r\nThe above statistics are particularly valuable, as they give the\r\nincidence of abdominal injuries compared with those in general in one\r\ndefinite battle. This amounted to the high number of 15 in 154 or 9.74\r\nper cent. wounded. I am inclined to think that this is a higher\r\nproportion than the average of the campaign, and that more of the men\r\nmust have been exposed in the erect position than was ordinarily the\r\ncase during the fighting.\r\n\r\nThe statistics also show that 33.33 per cent. of the patients with\r\nabdominal injuries died within from twenty-four to twenty-eight hours,\r\nand that the percentage of deaths had risen to 73.33 per cent. at the\r\nend of the third day. These numbers again seem high, but in this\r\nrelation it may be noted that, as a small force only was present, and as\r\nall the patients were together, Mr. Cheyne had unusually good\r\nopportunities for seeing all the cases.\r\n\r\nOne other point is doubtful from the report, and that is what percentage\r\nof the wounds were caused by bullets of small calibre. In one case it is\r\ndefinitely stated that the wound was large, and in the second that gas\r\nescaped from the wound; both of these may have been instances in which a\r\nlarge bullet, or some expanding form, had been employed, and there is no\r\ndoubt that the use of such projectiles was more common at this stage of\r\nthe campaign than it was earlier.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of injuries to the intestine._--Some general rules for the\r\nimmediate treatment of all cases may be laid down. First, the patients\r\nmust be removed with as little disturbance as possible, and absolute\r\nstarvation must be insisted upon. If the patients be suffering from\r\nsevere shock, hypodermic injections of strychnine should be\r\nadministered, or possibly some stimulant by the rectum.\r\n\r\nAfter a battle, when these cases may be brought in in considerable\r\nnumber, they should be collected and placed in the same tent. The\r\nobjection to congregating a number of severely wounded patients together\r\nmust be disregarded in the face of the manifest advantage of being able\r\nto treat all alike in the matter of feeding. After the battles of the\r\nKimberley relief force, Surgeon-General Wilson, at my request, had all\r\nthe abdominal cases placed in a large marquee, where we were able to\r\ncarefully watch the whole of the patients from hour to hour, and little\r\nchance existed for any indiscretion on the part of the patients in the\r\nway of eating or drinking.\r\n\r\nIf possible, the patients should be kept absolutely quiet until they are\r\nevidently out of danger. A week's stay at Orange River sufficed for this\r\nobject in the cases referred to. The avoidance of transport is\r\nmanifestly of extreme prognostic importance.\r\n\r\nWhen feeding is commenced at the end of twenty-four or thirty-six hours,\r\nit must be in the form at first of warm water, then milk administered in\r\ntea-spoonfuls only.\r\n\r\nIn doubtful cases the use of morphia must be avoided.\r\n\r\nOperative treatment is required in a certain number of the cases, but in\r\nthe majority of instances we are met with the extreme difficulty that in\r\na very large proportion of the occasions upon which these wounds are\r\nreceived an exploratory abdominal section is not warranted in\r\nconsequence of the conditions under which it has to be performed.\r\n\r\nA word must be added as to these difficulties; they are in part purely\r\nof an administrative nature, partly surgical. After a great battle the\r\nwounded are numerous, and amongst them a very considerable proportion of\r\nthe wounds and injuries are of such a nature as to do extremely well if\r\npromptly dealt with, and each of these makes small demands on the time\r\nof the staff. Abdominal operations, on the other hand, are\r\nunsatisfactory from a prognostic point of view, and their performance\r\nrequires much time and the assistance of a considerable number of the\r\nmen, who are obliged to neglect the treatment of the more promising\r\ncases for those of doubtful issue. This difficulty, although not\r\nsurgical in its nature, is nevertheless a practical one of great\r\nimportance and appeals strongly to the Principal Medical Officers in\r\ncharge of the arrangements. It is only to be avoided by an increase of\r\nthe staff, which is not likely to be made except on very special\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nOther difficulties are purely surgical. First, the difficulty\r\nof diagnosing with certainty a perforating lesion. In the presence of\r\nthe fact that many incomplete lesions follow wounds crossing the\r\nintestinal area, and that these give rise to modified symptoms, I\r\nbelieve this determination to be impossible without the aid of an\r\nexploratory incision. Here we are met with the remaining surgical\r\ndifficulties--disadvantages such as the absence of sufficient aid to the\r\noperating surgeon, difficulties connected with the temperature, wind,\r\nand dust, and as to the subsequent treatment of the patient. Again\r\ndifficulty in obtaining the most important adjunct, suitable water, or\r\nindeed any water in a sufficient quantity.\r\n\r\nIt is of course obvious that conditions may exist in which all these\r\ntroubles may be avoided. Again, the practical difficulty adverted to\r\nabove does not come in the way when a single man happens to sustain an\r\nabdominal wound on the march. Under such circumstances an exploration\r\nmay be not only justifiable, but obligatory, and the general rules of\r\nsurgery must be followed rather than such incomplete indications as are\r\nsuggested below.\r\n\r\nMy own experience led me to the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. A wound in the intestinal area should be watched with care. In the\r\nface of the numerous recoveries in such cases, habitual abdominal\r\nexploration is not justified, under the conditions usually prevailing in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n2. The very large class of patients excluded by this rule from operation\r\nleads us to a smaller and less satisfactory number to be divided into\r\ntwo categories:\r\n\r\nPatients who die during the first twelve hours. The whole of these are\r\nnaturally unfit for operation, and their general condition when seen\r\noften precludes any thought of it.\r\n\r\nPatients with very severe injuries, as evidenced by the escape of faeces,\r\nor with wounds from flank to flank or taking an antero-posterior course\r\nin the small intestinal area. These patients die, and the majority of\r\nthem will always die whether operated upon or not. The undertaking of\r\noperations upon them is unpleasant to the surgeon, as being unlikely to\r\nbe attended with any great degree of success, whence the impression may\r\ngain ground that patients are killed by the operations. None the less, I\r\nthink these operations ought to be undertaken when the attendant\r\nconditions allow, and it is from this class of case that the real\r\nsuccesses will be drawn in the future. The history of such injuries,\r\nafter all, corresponds exactly with what we were long familiar with in\r\ntraumatic ruptures in civil practice, and now know may be avoided by a\r\nsufficiently early interference. The whole question here is one of time,\r\nand this will always be the trouble in military work.\r\n\r\n3. The expectant attitude which is obligatory under the above rules in\r\ndoubtful cases, brings us face to face with a large proportion of\r\npatients in the early or late stage of peritoneal septicaemia. These\r\ncases run on exactly the same lines as those in which the same condition\r\nis secondary to spontaneous perforation of the bowel, in which we\r\nconsider it our duty to operate, and in which a definite percentage of\r\nrecoveries is obtained. Hence another unpleasant duty is here imposed\r\nupon the surgeon. Two such cases on which I operated are recounted\r\nabove, and although I cannot say they give much encouragement, I should\r\nadd that in the only one I left untouched, I regretted my want of\r\ncourage for the five days during which the patient continued to carry on\r\na miserable existence.\r\n\r\n4. The treatment of the cases in which an expectant attitude is followed\r\nby the advent of localised suppuration presents no difficulty; simple\r\nincision alone is needed, and healing follows.\r\n\r\nAs a rule this is a late condition. In one case of injury to the\r\nascending colon recounted above, however, considerable local escape of\r\nfaeces had occurred, and a successful result was obtained by a local\r\nincision on the third day without suture of the bowel. In this case I\r\nbelieve the wound in the bowel to have been of the nature of a long\r\nslit, but the surrounding adhesions were so firm as to render any\r\ninterference with them a great risk, and a successful result was\r\nobtained at the cost of a somewhat prolonged recovery. I am convinced\r\nthat the best course was followed here. (No. 131.)\r\n\r\nWhen the suppuration was of a less acute character, it was generally\r\nadvisable to allow the pus to make its way towards the surface before\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\n5. Cases of injury to the colon in which the posterior aspect is\r\ninvolved should be treated by free opening up of the wound, and either\r\nby suture of the bowel or else its fixation to the surface. I operated\r\non one such case, and although the patient eventually died on the eighth\r\nday, from septicaemia, he certainly had a chance. Two cases where the\r\nopening looked so free that one almost thought the wound could be\r\nregarded as a lumbar colotomy did badly; in both infection of the\r\npleura took place, besides extension of suppuration into the\r\nretro-peritoneal areolar tissue. In the future I should always feel\r\ninclined to enlarge such wounds and bring the bowel to the surface.\r\n\r\nAs regards actual technique the majority of the wounds are particularly\r\nwell suited to suture; three stitches across the opening and one at\r\neither end of the resulting crease sufficed to close the opening\r\neffectively. The openings in the small intestine were not as a rule\r\ndifficult to find, on account of the ecchymosis which surrounded them.\r\nFrom what I have seen stated in the reports given by other surgeons,\r\nthere seems to have been more difficulty in discovering wounds in the\r\nlarge gut. Under ordinary circumstances the only instruments specially\r\nneeded are a needle and some silk. At my first two operations, as my\r\ninstruments had gone astray, the wounds were readily closed by a needle\r\nand cotton borrowed from the wife of a railway porter.\r\n\r\nIf aseptic sponges or pads are not available, boiled squares of ordinary\r\nlint may be employed for the belly, and towels wrung out of 1 to 20\r\ncarbolic acid solution used to surround the field of operation. Whenever\r\nthere is any likelihood of the necessity for operations, water boiled\r\nand filtered should be kept ready in special bottles.\r\n\r\nWhen septic peritonitis was already present, the ordinary procedure of\r\ndry mopping, followed by irrigation, was necessary, before closing the\r\nbelly.\r\n\r\nThe after-treatment should be on the usual lines as to feeding, &c.\r\n\r\nI am unaware to what degree success followed intestinal operations\r\ngenerally during the campaign. I saw only one case in which the small\r\nintestine had been treated by excision and the insertion of a Murphy's\r\nbutton in which a cure followed: this case was in the Scottish Royal Red\r\nCross hospital under the care of Mr. Luke. I heard of two cases in which\r\nthe large intestine was successfully sutured, and of one other in which\r\nrecovery followed the removal of a considerable length of the small\r\nbowel for multiple wounds.\r\n\r\nIn concluding these most unsatisfactory remarks, I should add that the\r\nimpressions are those that were gained as the result of the conditions\r\nby which we were bound in South Africa, and which might recur even in a\r\nmore civilised region. Under really satisfactory conditions nothing I\r\nsaw in my South African experience would lead me to recommend any\r\ndeviation from the ordinary rules of modern surgery, except in so far as\r\nI should be more readily inclined to believe that wounds in certain\r\npositions already indicated might occur without perforation of the bowel\r\nwhen produced by bullets of small calibre; and further in cases where I\r\nbelieved the fixed portion of the large bowel was the segment of the\r\nalimentary canal that had been exposed to risk, I should not be inclined\r\nto operate hastily.\r\n\r\nA careful consideration of the whole of the cases that I saw leaves me\r\nwith the firm impression that perforating wounds of the small intestine\r\ndiffer in no way in their results and consequences when produced by\r\nsmall-calibre bullets, from those of every-day experience, although when\r\nthere is reason merely to suspect their presence an exploration is not\r\nindicated under circumstances that may add a fresh danger to the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the urinary bladder._--Perforating wounds of the bladder are\r\nthe injuries nearest akin to those we have just considered, but a great\r\ngulf separates them, in so far as the escape of a few drops or even a\r\nconsiderable quantity of normal urine does not necessarily mean\r\nperitoneal infection. The difference in this particular was very\r\nforcibly demonstrated in my experience, since an uncomplicated\r\nperforation of the bladder in the intra-peritoneal portion of the viscus\r\nproved to be an injury that not infrequently recovered spontaneously, I\r\nbelieve in a considerable proportion of the cases.\r\n\r\nI include only one such case in my list because it was the only example\r\nwhich happened to be under my personal observation during its whole\r\ncourse, but from time to time I was shown several others in which the\r\nposition of the external apertures and the transient presence of\r\nhaematuria left little doubt as to the nature of the injury. The case\r\nrecounted above, No. 190, is of especial interest, since the patient\r\nrecovered from an injury which involved both the bladder and a fixed\r\nportion of the large intestine in contact with its posterior surface.\r\n\r\nIn another, No. 194, a transient inflammatory thickening pointed to a\r\nlocal inflammation of a non-infective character, since no suppuration\r\nensued, and this may have been a case of extra-peritoneal wound; on the\r\nother hand, the bladder may have entirely escaped injury. In wounds of\r\nthe portions of the viscus not clad in peritoneum, as a rule, a very\r\ndifferent prognosis obtains. Two typical cases are related, which I\r\nbelieve fairly represent the general results which follow when the\r\nbladder is either wounded behind the symphysis or at the base. The first\r\ncase, No. 195, exemplifies a very characteristic form of wound when\r\nsmall-calibred bullets are concerned. The bullet, taking a course more\r\nor less parallel to that of the wall of the viscus, cut a long slit in\r\nits anterior wall. This bullet in its onward passage comminuted the\r\nhorizontal ramus of the pubes, and lodged in the thigh. Into the latter\r\nregion the greater part of the extravasated urine escaped. I think the\r\nhistory of this case fully shows that I made a blunder in not performing\r\na proper exploration, instead of contenting myself with an incision in\r\nthe thigh. My only excuse was that the patient at the time I saw him was\r\nin a very collapsed state, and a severe grade of abdominal distension\r\nsuggested that septic peritonitis was already in an advanced stage. In\r\npoint of fact, the patient at once improved, sufficiently so to be able\r\nto undergo a second exploration at a later date by Mr. Hanwell at the\r\nBase, only dying of septicaemia at the end of twenty-one days. Even a\r\nfree supra-pubic vent might, I believe, have given him a chance of life.\r\n\r\nWhen the perforation was at the base of the bladder, however, the\r\nprognosis was very bad, and, as far as I know, not a single patient\r\nescaped death. The increase of risk in an extra-peritoneal wound of this\r\nviscus is indeed very great, while an intra-peritoneal perforation may\r\nbe considered an injury of lesser severity, provided the urine be of\r\nnormal character.\r\n\r\n     (194_a_) _Possible wound of the bladder._--Wounded at\r\n     Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), immediately above the\r\n     symphysis pubis; _exit_, in the buttock, behind the tip of the\r\n     left great trochanter. The man was struck while advancing, and\r\n     fell, thinking at the time 'that he was struck in the foot.' He\r\n     lay twelve hours on the field, and passed water for the first\r\n     time when the bearer removed him. During the next two days he\r\n     passed urine only twice, and no blood was noticed. The bowels\r\n     acted on the evening of the third day. When seen on the fourth\r\n     day he complained of aching pain in the lower part of the\r\n     belly, and a concentric patch of tender induration extended for\r\n     about 1-1/2 inch around the wound. The abdominal wall was\r\n     moving well. The tongue was clean and moist. There was no blood\r\n     in the urine, and micturition was not frequent. Temperature\r\n     99.4 deg.. Pulse 80, good strength. The patient was then sent to\r\n     the Base. At the end of seventeen days there was still a little\r\n     tenderness in the left iliac fossa; but the man was otherwise\r\n     well, and at the end of a month he was sent home.\r\n\r\n     (195) _Extra-peritoneal wound of the bladder._--Wounded at\r\n     Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), at the fore part of the right\r\n     buttock. No exit. The patient was seen on the third day. He had\r\n     an expression of extreme anxiety, and complained of very great\r\n     pain in the abdomen and thigh. The abdomen was greatly\r\n     distended and tympanitic, and the left thigh and groin were\r\n     very much swollen and oedematous, with some redness of\r\n     surface. Temperature 100 deg., pulse 120. No sickness, tongue\r\n     moist, bowels confined. Retention of urine. The condition of\r\n     the patient was very grave; but he was anaesthetised, clear\r\n     urine was withdrawn from the bladder by catheter, and an\r\n     incision was made into the thigh just below the inner third of\r\n     Poupart's ligament, where fluctuation was evident. Two pints of\r\n     bloody urine were evacuated, and when a finger was introduced\r\n     it passed over a fracture of the pubes into the pelvis, but not\r\n     into the peritoneal cavity. In view of the patient's condition\r\n     it was not thought wise to proceed further, and he somewhat\r\n     improved later, and was sent to the Base. Loss of power in the\r\n     right lower extremity pointed to injury to the anterior crural\r\n     nerve.\r\n\r\n     On the patient's arrival at Wynberg there were signs of local\r\n     peritonitis in the lower half of the abdomen, and all his urine\r\n     was passed from the wound in the left thigh. Some days later\r\n     this wound was enlarged to allow of the freer exit of pus, and\r\n     a fragment of bone was removed. The wound granulated healthily,\r\n     but the man steadily emaciated and lost ground, with signs of\r\n     chronic septicaemia, and he died on the twenty-first day. At the\r\n     _post-mortem_ examination a transverse wound of the anterior\r\n     wall of the bladder behind the pubes, below the peritoneal\r\n     reflexion, was found gaping somewhat widely, and 2 inches in\r\n     length. There was little sign of previous peritonitis. The\r\n     retained bullet was discovered beneath the femoral vessels in\r\n     the left thigh.\r\n\r\n     (196) _Extra-peritoneal perforation of the bladder._--Wounded\r\n     at Paardeberg. _Entry_ (Mauser), 3 inches above the left tuber\r\n     ischii; _exit_, above the symphysis, immediately over the right\r\n     margin of the penis. The patient was retiring to fetch\r\n     ammunition when shot. Urine was noted to escape from both\r\n     apertures the day after, and this continued until he was sent\r\n     down to the Base on the fourteenth day. The patient was then\r\n     considerably emaciated, complained of great pain, especially\r\n     down the left thigh (sciatic nerve), the temperature averaged\r\n     100 deg., the pulse 80, tongue clean and moist, bowels acted\r\n     regularly, no sign of injury to the rectum. He was taking food\r\n     fairly, but was very sleepless. Urine was passed per urethram,\r\n     and also escaped by both wounds. The abdomen was flaccid and\r\n     sunken, respiratory movements being confined to the upper half.\r\n\r\n     As there was evidence of considerable infiltration in the\r\n     buttock, the original entry wound was enlarged, and a catheter\r\n     was tied into the bladder. Little change occurred in the\r\n     symptoms and the local condition, urine and pus continued to\r\n     escape freely from the posterior wound, and the patient\r\n     gradually sank, dying on the thirty-eighth day. At the\r\n     _post-mortem_ examination the peritoneum was found intact and\r\n     unaltered, but there was extensive pelvic cellulitis around the\r\n     bladder, a large slough and some pus lying in the cavum Retzii.\r\n     An aperture of entry still open existed in the centre of the\r\n     anterior wall of the bladder, and a patent exit opening at the\r\n     base of the trigone. The bullet had passed out of the pelvis by\r\n     the great sciatic notch.\r\n\r\nThe above remarks and cases sufficiently set forth the prognosis in\r\nthese injuries. For the intra-peritoneal lesions an expectant plan of\r\ntreatment may be followed by uncomplicated recovery. Mention has already\r\nbeen made of a case in which a Mauser bullet was retained in the bladder\r\nand was subsequently passed per urethram. In such a case a cystotomy\r\nwould be indicated were the bullet discovered in the viscus.\r\n\r\nAs to extra-peritoneal injuries it is difficult to lay down guiding\r\nlines. I believe the ideal treatment would be a supra-pubic cystotomy\r\nand drainage of the bladder by a Sprengel's pump apparatus, such as we\r\nemploy at home. Under these circumstances, with the possibility of\r\nkeeping the bladder actually empty, I believe good results might be\r\nobtained. Certainly drainage of the bladder by a catheter tied in proved\r\nworse than useless, and I very much doubt whether a simple supra-pubic\r\nopening would give any better results under the circumstances under\r\nwhich a patient has to be treated in a Field hospital.\r\n\r\nCases might, however, occur in which oblique passage of the bullet cuts\r\na groove and makes a large opening in the peritoneum-clad portion of the\r\nviscus. Under satisfactory conditions a laparotomy would be here\r\nindicated. I take it that this condition would most probably be\r\naccompanied by retention of bloody urine, which fact would arouse\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE SOLID ABDOMINAL VISCERA\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the kidney._--Tracks implicating the kidneys were of\r\ncomparatively common occurrence. As uncomplicated injuries they healed\r\nrapidly, and without producing any serious symptoms beyond transient\r\nhaematuria.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the lesion appeared to vary with the direction of the\r\nwound. In many cases a simple puncture no doubt alone existed, an injury\r\nno more to be feared than the exploratory punctures often made for\r\nsurgical purposes. In other cases the wounds may have been of the nature\r\nof notches and grooves.\r\n\r\nTwo of the cases recounted below were of a more severe variety; in one\r\n(No. 201) both kidneys were implicated by symmetrical wounds of the\r\nloin, and in the case of the right organ a transverse rupture was\r\nproduced, which was followed by the development of a hydro-nephrosis,\r\nand later by suppuration. This injury was probably the result of a wound\r\nfrom a short range, as the patient was one of those wounded in the early\r\npart of the day at the battle of Magersfontein. It was complicated by a\r\nwound of the spleen and an injury to the spinal cord producing\r\nincomplete paraplegia accompanied by retention of urine. The last\r\ncomplication was responsible for the death of the patient, since\r\nascending infection from the bladder led to the development of\r\npyo-nephrosis and death from secondary peritonitis.\r\n\r\nCase 202 is an instance of a transverse wound of the upper part of the\r\nabdominal cavity; it is impossible to say what further complications\r\nwere present. The early development of a tympanitic abscess suggested an\r\ninjury to the colon, but this was not by any means certain. The\r\ncondition of the kidney was very likely similar to that in the last\r\ncase, but the ultimate recovery of the patient left this a matter of\r\ndoubt. The case was also one dependent on a short-range wound, since the\r\npatient, one of the Scandinavian contingent, was wounded at\r\nMagersfontein during close fighting.\r\n\r\nThe common history of the symptoms after a wound of the kidney was\r\nmoderate haemorrhage from the organ, persisting for two to four days. In\r\none of the cases recounted below the haematuria was accompanied by the\r\npassage of ureteral clots, but this was not a common occurrence.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of comparison I have included one case of wound of the\r\nkidney from a large bullet, in which death was due to internal\r\nhaemorrhage. In this instance the injury was a complex one, the lung\r\ncertainly, and the back of the liver probably, being concurrently\r\ninjured. None the less if the same track had been produced by a bullet\r\nof small calibre I believe the injury would not have proved a fatal one.\r\nI never saw such free renal haemorrhage in any of the Mauser or\r\nLee-Metford wounds.\r\n\r\n     (197) _Wound of right kidney._--Wounded at Modder River while\r\n     lying in the prone position; retired 100 yards at the double\r\n     with his company, and walked a further 1-1/2 mile. There was\r\n     very slight bleeding. _Entry_ (Mauser), in the tenth right\r\n     intercostal space in the mid-axillary line; _exit_, in eleventh\r\n     interspace, 2 inches from the spinous processes. Cylindrical\r\n     blood-clots, 3 inches in length, were passed on the first two\r\n     occasions of micturition after the accident, and the urine\r\n     contained blood. For four days he could only lie on the wounded\r\n     side. When seen on the third day the urine was normal, and\r\n     there were no signs of injury to either thoracic or abdominal\r\n     viscera. He returned to England well at the end of a month.\r\n\r\n     (198) _Wound of right kidney._--Wounded at Modder River while\r\n     kneeling to dress another man's wound. _Entry_ (Mauser), in the\r\n     seventh right intercostal space in the nipple line; _exit_, 1\r\n     inch to the right of the twelfth dorsal spine. The man was\r\n     carried off the field, and during the first day vomited\r\n     frequently. For two days there was blood in his urine, and he\r\n     passed water four to five times daily. He returned to duty at\r\n     the end of three weeks.\r\n\r\n     (199) _Wound of the left kidney._--Wounded at Magersfontein.\r\n     _Entry_ (Mauser), 2 inches to the left and 1 inch below the\r\n     left nipple. No exit. Lying in prone position when struck.\r\n     Bloody urine was passed at normal intervals for four days, when\r\n     the haematuria ceased. No thoracic signs, and no other sign of\r\n     abdominal injury. There was tenderness in the left loin below\r\n     the twelfth rib for some days, possibly over the position of\r\n     the bullet, but the latter was neither localised nor removed.\r\n\r\n     (200) _Wound of the right kidney._--Wounded at Magersfontein\r\n     while retiring on his feet. _Entry_ (Mauser), immediately to\r\n     the right of the second lumbar spinous process; bullet retained\r\n     and lay beneath margin of ninth right costal cartilage. The man\r\n     passed urine containing blood twelve times during the first\r\n     day, and haematuria continued until the evening of the third\r\n     day. On the third day the belly was tumid and did not move\r\n     well; there was no dulness in the right flank. Pulse 120, fair\r\n     strength. Temperature 99 deg.. Respirations 20. Tongue moist,\r\n     bowels confined for four days. The fifth day the pulse fell to\r\n     76, and the bowels were moved by an enema. Great tenderness\r\n     over bullet. The tenderness persisted over the bullet and also\r\n     in the right flank until the tenth day, when the bullet was\r\n     removed. At the end of a month the patient returned to England\r\n     well but during the third week there was occasionally blood in\r\n     the urine.\r\n\r\n     (201) _Wound of both kidneys (rupture of right) and\r\n     spleen._--Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), (_a_) 1\r\n     inch to right of second lumbar spinous process; (_b_) above\r\n     angle of left ninth rib: _exits_, (_a_) 1 inch internal to\r\n     right anterior superior iliac spine; (_b_) in seventh\r\n     intercostal space in mid-axillary line. The wound on the right\r\n     side gave rise to a lesion of the lumbar bulb (see p. 315), and\r\n     the patient suffered throughout with retention. There was\r\n     complete paralysis of the right lower extremity, both motor and\r\n     sensory. For ten days there was haematuria, and very severe\r\n     cystitis developed, while the patient suffered with severe\r\n     abdominal pain. The cystitis persisted, also retention, which\r\n     gradually gave way to dribbling, while irregular rise of\r\n     temperature and tenderness in the loins pointed to ascending\r\n     inflammation in the ureters. The patient gradually lost\r\n     ground, and a month later suddenly developed signs of\r\n     peritonitis, severe vomiting, distension, and dulness in the\r\n     right flank; and in two days he died.\r\n\r\n     At the _post-mortem_ examination the following condition was\r\n     found:--On the right side general pleural adhesions, recent\r\n     lymph over ascending colon and caecum, [Symbol: ounce]vj of\r\n     bloody fluid in a localised cavity between colon, kidney,\r\n     stomach, and liver. Lower quarter of right kidney in half its\r\n     width separated from main part of organ, yellow in colour, and\r\n     enveloped in disintegrating clot. Blood-staining of psoas\r\n     sheath; no injury to vertebral column or to bowel detected.\r\n\r\n     On the left side recent pleural adhesions and consolidation of\r\n     base of lung, rent of diaphragm; spleen soft and disorganised\r\n     and presenting a yellow cicatrix at its upper end, and at\r\n     antero-external aspect of left kidney was a soft yellow\r\n     puckered spot about the size of a florin, dipping 3/4 of an\r\n     inch into the organ, which was otherwise healthy, beyond\r\n     congestion. The capsules of both kidneys were adherent, but\r\n     there was no sign of suppuration.\r\n\r\n     (202) _Wound of right kidney. Traumatic\r\n     hydronephrosis._--Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_\r\n     (Lee-Metford), in the eleventh intercostal space in the\r\n     posterior axillary line; _exit_, in the tenth right interspace,\r\n     in mid axillary line. The patient was in the prone position\r\n     when struck, and lay on the field from 5 A.M. until 6 P.M.\r\n     There was no sickness, and the bowels did not act. When seen on\r\n     the fourth day he was cheerful, but in some pain. The abdominal\r\n     wall moved well, but was rigid; there was some general\r\n     distension, and very marked local distension of the gastric\r\n     area extending across to the right, so that a depressed band\r\n     extended between the upper and lower parts of the belly. There\r\n     was marked local dulness in the right flank, which did not\r\n     shift on movement; the abdomen was elsewhere tympanitic. Tongue\r\n     furred, bowels confined; there has been no sickness, and no\r\n     haematemesis. Urine normal, and in good quantity. Temperature\r\n     100 deg.. Pulse 84, good strength. There was impairment of\r\n     sensation in the area of distribution of the external cutaneous\r\n     and crural branch of the genito-crural nerves.\r\n\r\n     On the sixth day the bowels acted, after the administration of\r\n     [Symbol: ounce]j of sulphate of magnesia, and the distension was\r\n     much lessened, although the belly retained its unusual\r\n     appearance. The dulness in the flank was unaltered. Temperature\r\n     100.8 deg., pulse 92.\r\n\r\n     A week later the man was much improved, suffering no pain.\r\n     Temperature ranged from 99 to 100 deg., and the pulse about 80. The\r\n     abdomen was normal in appearance, except for general prominence\r\n     of the right thorax in the hepatic area.\r\n\r\n     During the third week a large tympanitic abscess developed at\r\n     the aperture of exit, and this was opened (Mr. S. W. F.\r\n     Richardson) through the chest, and a large collection of\r\n     foul-smelling pus, but no faecal matter, evacuated. The patient\r\n     again improved, but a fortnight later a swelling and apparent\r\n     signs of local peritonitis developed in the right inguinal and\r\n     lower umbilical and lumbar regions. An incision made over this,\r\n     however, disclosed a normal peritoneal cavity and was closed.\r\n\r\n     At the end of ten weeks the patient was sent to the Base\r\n     hospital; a large firm swelling was then evident, extending\r\n     from the liver to the inguinal region, and nearly to the median\r\n     line. This gradually increased until it filled half the belly;\r\n     it was at first thought to be a retro-peritoneal haematoma\r\n     (similar to that described in case 194), but it became quite\r\n     soft and fluctuating, and was then tapped, and [Symbol:\r\n     ounce]50 of blood-stained fluid, which proved to be urine, were\r\n     removed. The urine rapidly reaccumulated, and the cavity was\r\n     then laid freely open. Urine continued to discharge in large\r\n     quantity for two months, the man meanwhile remaining well, and\r\n     passing a somewhat variable daily quantity of urine ([Symbol:\r\n     ounce]xxiv-[Symbol: ounce]lx).\r\n\r\n     At the end of six months the wound had healed, and the man was\r\n     serving as an orderly in the hospital.\r\n\r\n     (203) _Wound of right kidney and lung._--Wounded near\r\n     Paardekraal, while crawling on hands and knees. _Entry_\r\n     (Martini-Henry, or small bullet making lateral impact), just\r\n     above the right nipple, opening ragged and large, bullet\r\n     retained. There was very severe shock, accompanied by vomiting,\r\n     but no haematemesis. Later there was some haemoptysis. Pulse 120,\r\n     respirations 48.\r\n\r\n     Twenty-four hours later the vomiting had ceased; the patient\r\n     had passed a restless night, in spite of an injection of\r\n     morphia. He lay on his right side, pale and collapsed, but\r\n     answered questions and was quite collected. Pulse\r\n     imperceptible, respirations 56; the abdomen moved freely. The\r\n     urine had been passed twice, and was chiefly blood. The patient\r\n     died shortly afterwards, apparently mainly from internal\r\n     haemorrhage, although restlessness was not a prominent feature.\r\n     As the Column was on the march no autopsy was possible.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of uncomplicated wounds of the kidney consisted in the\r\nensurance of rest, either alone, or with the administration of opium if\r\nthe haematuria was severe. The after-treatment in the event of the\r\ndevelopment of hydronephrosis is on ordinary lines. Tapping, or incision\r\nfollowed by extirpation of the injured viscus, if the less severe\r\nprocedures failed. I never saw a case where renal haemorrhage suggested\r\nthe removal of the kidney as a primary step, and much doubt whether such\r\na case is likely to be met with, as the result of a wound from a bullet\r\nof small calibre.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the liver._--Wounds of the liver were, I believe, responsible\r\nfor more cases of death from primary haemorrhage than those of the\r\nkidney. I heard of a few cases in which this occurred, although I never\r\nsaw one. Case 204 is of considerable interest as illustrating the result\r\nof an injury to one of the large bile ducts. Putting the deaths from\r\nprimary haemorrhage on one side, the prognosis in hepatic wounds was as\r\ngood as in those of the kidneys. A few fairly uncomplicated cases are\r\nquoted below, but wounds of the liver occurred in connection with a\r\nlarge number of other injuries both of the chest and abdomen, and except\r\nin the case of wound of the stomach, recorded on page 425, No. 164, and\r\nin case 188, I never saw any troublesome consequences ensue.\r\n\r\n_Nature of the lesions._--I never saw any case of so-called explosive\r\nlesion of the liver, such as have been described from experimental\r\nresults; this may have been due to the fact that such patients rapidly\r\nexpired, but such were never admitted into the hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe most favourable cases were those in which a simple perforation was\r\neffected; such were usually attended by a practical absence of symptoms,\r\nunless a large bile duct had been implicated, when a temporary biliary\r\nfistula resulted.\r\n\r\nBiliary fistulae were, however, much more common when the bullet scored\r\nthe surface of the organ. One such case is recounted under the heading\r\nof injuries to the stomach, No. 164. Here a deep gaping cleft with\r\ncoarsely granular margins extended the whole antero-posterior length of\r\nthe under surface of the left lobe, and the escape of bile was free.\r\nThis was the nearest approach to one of the so-called explosive injuries\r\nI met with.\r\n\r\nCase 207 is an example of a superficial injury from a bullet possibly of\r\nsmall calibre in which a superficial groove was followed by temporary\r\nescape of bile, and it is of interest to note a very similar condition\r\nin a shell injury (No. 210) recorded on p. 477.\r\n\r\nAlthough both these cases recovered, I think notching and superficial\r\ngrooving must be considered much more serious injuries than pure\r\nperforation. (See case 188, p. 442.)\r\n\r\nThe symptoms observed in these injuries have been already indicated in\r\nthe above description of the nature of the lesions. They consisted in\r\nthe pure perforations of practically nothing, in the grooves or the\r\nperforations implicating a large duct in the escape of bile. In two of\r\nthe cases in which a biliary fistula was present transient jaundice was\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the accompanying wound of the diaphragm gave rise to much\r\ndiscomfort; again, in the transverse wounds the action of the heart was\r\noften affected by the local cardiac shock accompanying the injury. In\r\none case in which the colon was at the same time wounded (No. 188), an\r\nabscess formed at the site of the hepatic wound, as might have been\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nAs uncomplicated injuries, these wounds were little to be feared. Except\r\nas a source of haemorrhage in rapidly dying patients, I never heard of a\r\nfatality. As a complication of other injuries, however, the wound of the\r\nliver, as has been shown, was sometimes of importance. It was remarkable\r\nin case 204 how little trouble the biliary fistula gave rise to,\r\nalthough the bile was discharged across the pleural cavity.\r\n\r\nThe treatment consisted in rest, and morphia in the cases of suspected\r\nprogressive haemorrhage, or in the presence of great pain. In cases where\r\nbile was escaping, it was important to ensure a free vent for the\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\n     (204) _Wound of liver. Biliary fistula._--Wounded at\r\n     Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Lee-Metford), below the seventh rib, in\r\n     the left nipple line; _exit_, through the eighth rib, in the\r\n     mid axillary line on the right side. The patient lay for\r\n     seventeen hours on the field, during which time the bowels\r\n     acted once, but there was no sickness. The bowels then remained\r\n     confined. When seen on the third day the abdomen was normal and\r\n     the chest resonant throughout on both sides; bile to the amount\r\n     of some ounces escaped from the wound on the right side.\r\n     Suffering no pain; temperature 99 deg., pulse 100. The bowels acted\r\n     freely the following day.\r\n\r\n     During the next fortnight there was little change; [Symbol:\r\n     ounce]ii-iij of bile escaped daily, and there was occasional\r\n     diarrhoea. At the end of that time, however, the temperature\r\n     rose; there was local redness and evidence of retention of pus.\r\n     The wound was therefore enlarged, some fragments of rib removed,\r\n     and a drainage tube inserted. After this the temperature fell,\r\n     and for the next two months the patient suffered little except\r\n     from the discharge from the sinus; this persisted for three\r\n     months, becoming less in amount and less bile-stained, the\r\n     fistula eventually closing in the fourteenth week, when the\r\n     patient was sent home on parole.\r\n\r\n     (205) _Wound of liver_.--_Entry_ (Mauser), 1 inch below and to\r\n     the left of the ensiform cartilage; _exit_, in the sixth right\r\n     intercostal space, just behind the posterior axillary line. The\r\n     trooper was sitting bolt upright on his horse at the time; both\r\n     were shot and fell together. 'Stitch' on coughing or laughing\r\n     was the only sign noted after the accident; this rapidly\r\n     subsided.\r\n\r\n     (206) _Wound of the liver._--Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_\r\n     (Mauser), through the seventh left costal cartilage, 1 inch\r\n     from the base of the ensiform cartilage; _exit_, below the\r\n     twelfth rib 2 inches to the right of the lumbar spines. The\r\n     patient lay on the field some hours and was brought in at night\r\n     very cold, and suffering with much shock. No signs of abdominal\r\n     injury developed, but the pulse remained as slow as 66 for some\r\n     days, and there was some pain and stiffness about back and\r\n     sides, or on taking a deep breath. These signs persisted some\r\n     days, but no others developed, and in six weeks the patient\r\n     returned to duty.\r\n\r\n     Some three months later this patient suffered from a short\r\n     severe attack suggesting local peritonitis, but he again\r\n     returned to duty.\r\n\r\n     (207) _Wound of the liver._--Wounded at Tweefontein. _Entry_,\r\n     in eighth intercostal space in right mid axillary line; _exit_,\r\n     1-1/2 inch below the point of the ensiform cartilage, 1/2 an\r\n     inch to the right of the mid line. The wounds were large, and\r\n     although the impact had been oblique, they were possibly\r\n     produced by a Martini-Henry or Guedes bullet.\r\n\r\n     On the second day bile began to escape from the exit aperture,\r\n     and this together with a little pus continued to be discharged\r\n     for a week, when the wound rapidly healed up. The only symptom\r\n     which occasioned any trouble was a stitch on inspiration,\r\n     probably attributable to the wound of the diaphragm. There was\r\n     no fracture of the rib.\r\n\r\n     (208) _Wound of the liver._--Wounded outside Heilbron at a\r\n     range of fifty yards. _Entry_ (Mauser), in the tenth right\r\n     interspace 2 inches to the right of the dorsal spines; _exit_,\r\n     through the gladiolus, immediately to the right of the median\r\n     line, and just above the junction with the ensiform cartilage.\r\n     There was considerable shock on reception of the injury, and a\r\n     great feeling of dizziness. Continuous vomiting set in and\r\n     persisted for the first two days, then became occasional, and\r\n     ceased only at the end of a week. There was also occasional\r\n     hiccough, and stitch on drawing a long breath. The respiration\r\n     was shallow and rapid. The bowels acted twice shortly after the\r\n     injury.\r\n\r\n     The pulse was rapid and small, and a week after the injury was\r\n     still above 100. The abdomen was then normal and moving\r\n     symmetrically, and the respiration fairly easy. There were no\r\n     signs of chest trouble, but some mucous expectoration. A slight\r\n     icteric tinge existed. The patient made a good recovery.\r\n\r\n_Wounds of the spleen._--Uncomplicated wounds of the spleen were\r\nnecessarily rare, and beyond this the strict localisation of a track to\r\nthe spleen is not a matter of great ease. None the less the spleen must\r\nhave been implicated in a considerable number of the wounds crossing the\r\nchest and abdomen. I know of only one case in which a wound which\r\ncrossed the splenic area caused death from haemorrhage, and of this I can\r\ngive no details, as I never saw the patient. In this instance, however,\r\na wound of the spleen was diagnosed after death from the position of the\r\nwounds. The patient continued to perform his duty as an officer in the\r\nfighting line for at least an hour after being struck, and then died\r\nrapidly apparently from an internal haemorrhage.\r\n\r\nIn case No. 201, included amongst the renal injuries, a wound of the\r\nspleen existed, but had given rise to no symptoms, and at the time of\r\ndeath, some three weeks later, was cicatrised. The only other assertion\r\nof importance that I can make is, that, as far as I could judge, wounds\r\nof the spleen from bullets of small calibre were not, as a rule,\r\naccompanied by haemorrhage, since I never saw a case in which dulness in\r\nthe left flank suggested the presence of extravasated blood, and in no\r\ncase that I saw was there any history of general symptoms pointing to\r\nthe loss of blood.\r\n\r\nThis is only to be explained by our similar experience with regard to\r\nwounds of the liver unaccompanied by puncture of main vessels, and\r\nperhaps haemorrhage is still less to be expected in the case of the\r\nspleen, in consequence of the contractile muscular tunic with which the\r\norgan is provided.\r\n\r\nI can quote no case of certain injury to the spleen, except that already\r\nreferred to discovered at a _post-mortem_ examination, but many wounds\r\nwere observed in positions of which the following may be taken as a\r\ntype. _Entry_, through the seventh left costal cartilage, 3/4 of an inch\r\nfrom the sternal margin; _exit_, 2-1/2 inches from the left lumbar\r\nspines at the level of the last rib.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the doctrine of chances I might quote the position of\r\nthe wound in the patient who lay in the next bed. Both patients were\r\nwounded while fighting at Almonds Nek. _Entry_, through right seventh\r\ncostal cartilage, 3/4 of an inch from the sternal margin; _exit_, 1-1/2\r\ninch from the lumbar spines, at the level of the last right rib.\r\n\r\nIn neither of these cases did anything except the position of the\r\nexternal apertures point to the infliction of visceral injury.\r\n\r\n_General remarks as to the prognosis in abdominal injuries._ The\r\nprognosis in each form of individual visceral injury has been already\r\nconsidered, but a few points affecting these injuries as a class should\r\nperhaps be further considered.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the influence of range on the severity of the injuries\r\ninflicted; I am not able to confirm the greater danger of short range,\r\nexcept in so far as there is no doubt that more shock attends such\r\ninjuries, and possibly some of the most severely wounded were killed\r\noutright as a direct consequence of the greater striking force of the\r\nbullet.\r\n\r\nAmong the cases in which but slight effects were noted, however, many\r\nwere said to have been hit within a range of 200 yards, as for instance\r\nthe two injuries quoted under the heading of wounds of the spleen.\r\n\r\nI personally saw no cases in which explosive injuries of the solid\r\nviscera were to be ascribed to this cause.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as to the immediate prognosis in all abdominal injuries, the\r\nensurance of rest and limitation as far as possible of transport were of\r\nthe highest importance, either in the case of wound of the alimentary\r\ncanal, or in wounds of the solid viscera in which haemorrhage was a\r\npossible result.\r\n\r\nThirdly, as to the later prognosis in these injuries; very few men are\r\nfit to resume active service without a prolonged period of rest. In\r\nspite of the insignificance of the primary symptoms, or of the\r\nfavourable course taken by the injuries, active exertion was almost\r\nalways followed for some months by the appearance of vague pains and\r\noccasionally by indications of recurrent peritoneal symptoms, pointing\r\nto the disturbance of quiescent haemorrhages, or of adhesions. Wounds of\r\nthe kidney are apparently those least liable to be followed by trouble.\r\n\r\nLastly, the prognosis was influenced in the case of many of the viscera\r\nby coexisting injury to other organs or parts.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at least thirty per cent. of the abdominal wounds were\r\ncomplicated by wound of the thorax; and in the lower segment of the\r\nabdomen injury to the extra-peritoneal portions of the pelvic organs was\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nBoth the immediate and ultimate prognosis were influenced greatly by\r\nthis fact.\r\n\r\nAs to the individual injuries:\r\n\r\n1. Wounds in the intestinal area, except in certain directions, often\r\ntraverse the abdomen without inflicting a perforating injury on the\r\nbowel.\r\n\r\n2. If the alimentary canal is perforated, injuries in certain segments,\r\neven if perforating, may be followed by spontaneous recovery. I should\r\nsay the prognosis from this point of view is best in the ascending\r\ncolon, then in the rectum; after these most favourable segments, I\r\nshould place the others in the following order: stomach, sigmoid\r\nflexure, descending colon. As to perforating wounds of the transverse\r\ncolon and small intestine, I believe spontaneous recovery to be very\r\nrare.\r\n\r\n3. Wounds of the solid viscera generally, usually heal spontaneously,\r\nand give no trouble unless one of the great vessels has been injured. I\r\ninclude in this category all organs except the pancreas, of wounds of\r\nwhich I had no experience.\r\n\r\n4. Wounds of the bladder, if of the nature of pure perforations in the\r\nintra-peritoneal segment, often heal spontaneously.\r\n\r\n5. As a rule, injuries to the organs in their intra-peritoneal course\r\nhave a far better prognosis than those which implicate the organs in\r\ntheir uncovered portions.\r\n\r\n6. The small calibre of the bullet is alone responsible for the\r\nfavourable results observed.\r\n\r\n7. The danger or otherwise of an intestinal injury depends mainly on\r\nmechanical conditions; for instance, the fixity of the ascending colon,\r\nand its comparative freedom from a covering of small intestine capable\r\nby movement of diffusing any infective material, account chiefly for\r\nsuch favourable results as are seen when that segment of the bowel is\r\nimplicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE EXTERNAL GENITAL ORGANS\r\n\r\nWounds of the _scrotum_ were not uncommon, especially in connection with\r\nperforations of the upper part of the thigh. They offered no special\r\nfeature, beyond the common tendency of every-day experience to the\r\ndevelopment of extensive ecchymosis.\r\n\r\nWounds of the _testicles_ I saw on several occasions. I remember only\r\none out of some half-dozen in which castration became necessary. I was\r\ntold of one case, for the accuracy of which I cannot vouch, in which\r\ndestruction of one testicle was followed by an attack of melancholia,\r\nculminating in the suicide of the patient.\r\n\r\nWounds of the _penis_ also occurred, but as a rule were unimportant. I\r\nappend a case, however; in which the penile urethra was wounded, which\r\nis of some interest.\r\n\r\n     (209) Wounded at Heilbron. Range 1,500 yards. _Entry_, 2-1/2\r\n     inches below the right anterior superior iliac spine; the\r\n     bullet traversed the groin superficially in the line of\r\n     Poupart's ligament, emerged, and crossed both penis and\r\n     scrotum. The trooper was in the saddle when struck, and the\r\n     penis probably somewhat coiled up. Three wounds were found, one\r\n     at the junction of the penis and scrotum which opened the\r\n     urethra, a second one about 3/4 of an inch along the under\r\n     surface of the penis, and a third on the left side of the base\r\n     of the prepuce. A considerable amount of oedema and\r\n     ecchymosis of the scrotum developed, but no extravasation of\r\n     urine. A catheter was kept in the urethra for some days, and\r\n     the opening eventually closed by granulation.\r\n\r\nI only once saw a patient with an injury to the deep urethra; in this\r\ncase concurrent injury to other pelvic organs led to death on the third\r\nday. As a good many of the patients with pelvic wounds died rapidly, the\r\naccident may have been more common than my experience would suggest.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] _British Med.

Of such injuries no further mention will be made.\r\n\r\nA very great variety of shells was employed during the campaign,\r\nespecially on the part of the Boers, and the frontispiece gives some\r\nidea of these. The photograph was taken by Mr. Kisch after the relief of\r\nLadysmith. For the want of more extended knowledge I shall confine\r\nmyself to the description of a few injuries caused by two classes of\r\nlarge shell, those of the Vickers-Maxim or 'Pom-pom,' and two varieties\r\nof shrapnel.\r\n\r\nThe large shells employed may be divided into classes according to the\r\nmetal used in their construction, and the nature of the explosive with\r\nwhich they were filled. These details are of some surgical import,\r\nbecause they affect the nature of the fragments into which the shells\r\nare broken up.\r\n\r\nFragments of shells constructed with cast iron and burst with powder,\r\nand also of forged steel exploded with lyddite, are depicted in fig. 90.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--A, B, D. Fragments of 200 lb. forged Steel\r\nHowitzer Shell exploded by lyddite. C. Fragment of Cast-iron Shell\r\nexploded by powder. B exhibits transverse markings which might be\r\nmistaken for the lines seen in the Boer segment shells, but which really\r\ncorrespond to the area of fixation of the copper driving band]\r\n\r\nExamination of fragment C of a cast-iron shell exploded by powder shows\r\nthe characteristic granular fracture, and edges, although sharp, yet of\r\na comparatively rounded nature. The fragment is also heavier for its\r\nsurface measurement, as the metal is thicker than that seen in the\r\nremaining fragments, although the cast-iron shell was of a much smaller\r\ncalibre than the steel one. The lesser degree of penetrative power, and\r\nincreased capacity to contuse, possessed by such fragments are obvious.\r\n\r\nA B and D are fragments of a large forged steel howitzer shell exploded\r\nby lyddite, such as were cast by our guns. The photograph well shows the\r\nmore tenacious structure of the metal in the incomplete longitudinal\r\nfissuring exhibited, while the margins are of a sharp knifelike\r\ncharacter, well calculated to penetrate or, in the case of superficial\r\ninjuries, to produce wounds of a more sharply incised character than the\r\ncast-iron shell. Fragments A and B also show an appearance suggestive of\r\npartial fusion, characteristic of high explosive action, in the turning\r\nof the prominent margins.\r\n\r\nThe larger fragments of such shells were responsible for the most\r\nserious mutilating injuries, while small fragments sometimes caused\r\ncomparatively simple perforating wounds. I remember a fragment of the\r\nfused character not larger than a small nut which had perforated the\r\nfront of the thigh of a Boer, and lodged near the inner surface of the\r\nfemur. Removal of the fragment was followed by a free gush of\r\nhaemorrhage. When the wound was opened up an opening was found in the\r\nexternal circumflex artery, haemorrhage from which had been controlled by\r\nthe impaction of the piece of shell. As an example of the cutting power\r\nof sharp fragments of shell I might instance the case of another Boer in\r\nwhom light passing contact had been made by the missile. A gaping\r\nincised wound extended from above the angle of the scapula down to the\r\nouter surface of the buttock. The wound involved the latissimus dorsi,\r\nand the external and internal oblique muscles of the abdomen. The\r\nseparate muscular layers were sharply defined in the lateral parts of\r\nthe floor of the wound, and remained so for some time during the gradual\r\ncontraction of the large granulating surface produced. The degree of\r\ncontusion was in fact slight, while the incised character was strongly\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the fragments merely struck the soldiers on the flat\r\nwithout producing any wound. In one such case a blow upon the\r\nepigastrium was, according to the patient, followed by the vomiting of a\r\nconsiderable amount of blood. A fluid diet was ordered, and no further\r\nill effects were noted. The following case illustrates an oblique blow\r\nof a perforating character, which was nevertheless recovered from.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Various portions of Brass Percussion and Time\r\nFuses]\r\n\r\n     (210) _Shell-wound of abdomen. Injury to liver._--Wounded at\r\n     Paardeberg by a fragment of shell. Aperture of entry, a ragged\r\n     opening in the median line. The fragment of shell was retained\r\n     over the ninth costal cartilage in the nipple line. The wound\r\n     bled freely, but the man was taken into camp, and then four\r\n     miles on to the hospital, where he was anaesthetised and the\r\n     fragment extracted. The wound of entry was at the same time\r\n     enlarged, cleansed, and partly sutured. The patient vomited\r\n     once after the anaesthetic, and the bowels remained confined for\r\n     three or four days after the injury. The extraction wound\r\n     healed readily, but a considerable amount of slimy,\r\n     bile-stained discharge was still escaping from the ragged\r\n     entrance wound on the man's arrival at the Base on the\r\n     fourteenth day. The abdomen was then normal in appearance, and\r\n     as to physical signs, except for a tympanitic note over the\r\n     hepatic area to the right of the wound. The temperature was\r\n     normal, the pulse 90, the tongue clean, and the bowels were\r\n     acting. At the end of four weeks pleurisy, with effusion,\r\n     developed on the right side; the chest was aspirated and\r\n     [Symbol: ounce]xx of clear serum drawn off. The man then\r\n     rapidly improved; the bile-stained discharge ceased at the end\r\n     of five weeks, and a small granulating wound eventually closed\r\n     at the end of two months, when the man returned to England.\r\n\r\nFig. 91 is inserted to illustrate the multifarious nature of the\r\nfragments into which the component parts of shells may break up. The\r\npieces are for the most part of brass, and formed parts of either time\r\nor percussion fuses.\r\n\r\nFig. 92 represents the one-pound Vickers-Maxim shell in its actual size.\r\nThe wounds produced by this shell are of some interest, since the\r\nVickers-Maxim may be said to have been on trial during this campaign.\r\nThe general opinion seems to have been to the effect that the moral\r\ninfluence produced by the continuous rapid firing of the gun and the\r\nattendant unpleasant noise were its chief virtues. A considerable number\r\nof wounds must, however, have been produced by it, which, if not of\r\ngreat magnitude and severity, were, at any rate, calculated to put the\r\nrecipients out of action, and these wounds, moreover, were slower in\r\nhealing than many of the rifle-bullet injuries.\r\n\r\nThe shell is so small that it was said to occasionally strike the body\r\nas a whole, and perforate. I was shown a case in which a wounded officer\r\nwas confident that an entire shell had perforated his arm. The entry\r\nwound was at the outer part of the front of the forearm, the exit at the\r\ninner aspect of the arm, just above the elbow. Two ragged contused\r\nwounds existed, which healed slowly, but no serious nervous or vascular\r\ninjury had been produced. Although it is probable that only a fragment\r\nperforated in this case, it is of interest in connection with the\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nIn a case shown to me by Sir William Thomson in the Irish Hospital at\r\nBloemfontein, an entire shell had passed between the left arm and body\r\nof a trooper, perforating the haversack, as also a non-commissioned\r\nofficer's notebook contained within it, without exploding. The only\r\ninjury sustained by the trooper was a contusion on the inner aspect of\r\nthe elbow-joint, with slight signs of contusion of the ulnar nerve. The\r\ncase is of some importance, as showing that a comparatively resistent\r\nbody can be perforated without necessary explosion on the part of the\r\nshell; hence the possibility of a similar perforation of the soft parts\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--Unexploded 1-lb. Vickers-Maxim Shell. (Actual\r\nsize)]\r\n\r\nFig. 93 is of a number of fragments of Vickers-Maxim shells, and it was\r\nby such that the great majority of the wounds were produced.\r\n\r\nWounds from fragments of these shells were, indeed, not at all rare.\r\nThey were met with on any position; but, as far as my experience went,\r\nthey were more common on the lower extremities than in other parts of\r\nthe body, if the sufferers were in the erect position when wounded. I\r\nsaw a good many wounds in the neighbourhood of the knee, some of which\r\nimplicated the joint. When the injuries were received by patients in the\r\nlying or crouching positions, any part of the body was equally likely to\r\nbe affected, or, again, the presence of large stones or rocks in the\r\nvicinity might determine the scattering of the flying fragments at a\r\nmore dangerous height than when the shells burst from contact with the\r\nactual ground.\r\n\r\nThe relation of one or two examples of wounds from pom-pom fragments may\r\nnot be without interest, the more so as they illustrate the favourable\r\ninfluence of a low degree of velocity on the part of a projectile. I saw\r\nthree wounds produced by the percussion fuses of these shells, an\r\nexperience which shows that they were not very uncommon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--Fragments of Vickers-Maxim 1-lb. Shells. The\r\ncentre fragment of the lower row is the point of a steel armour-piercing\r\nshell; although unsuitable for the purpose, they were occasionally\r\nemployed in the field by the Boers]\r\n\r\n     (211) _Perforating shell-wound of abdomen._--Wounded at\r\n     Magersfontein by the fuse screw of a small shell\r\n     (Vickers-Maxim). Aperture of entry ragged, roughly circular,\r\n     and 2 inches in diameter, with much-contused margins situated\r\n     in the median line, nearly midway between the ensiform\r\n     cartilage and umbilicus. The screw was lodged in the abdominal\r\n     wall at the margin of the thorax, just outside the left nipple\r\n     line. The aperture of entry was cleansed by Major Harris,\r\n     R.A.M.C., who determined the fact that penetration of the\r\n     peritoneal cavity had occurred, and removed the fuse (see fig.\r\n     94) by a separate incision. The patient made an uneventful and\r\n     uninterrupted recovery, the wound healing by granulation and\r\n     leaving little weakness of the abdominal wall. He returned to\r\n     England at the end of five weeks.\r\n\r\nIn a second case the fuse, together with a fragment of the iron case,\r\nentered the buttock by a ragged opening. The fragment of iron escaped by\r\nan exit aperture of about the same size. When the patient arrived at the\r\nBase some days after the injury, a hard body was felt in the wound, and\r\non exploration the fuse was found and removed.\r\n\r\nIn a third case the fuse struck the side of the foot below the outer\r\nmalleolus and comminuted the astragalus, and then passing forwards\r\nlodged beneath the extensor tendons of the toes. The wound was explored\r\nat the time of the injury and some fragments of bone removed;\r\nconsiderable cellulitis supervened, and the fuse was only discovered\r\nsome days later when the patient came under the care of Sir W. Thomson\r\nin the Irish Hospital in Pretoria. It was there removed, together with\r\nsome more fragments of bone, and the wound slowly granulated. The\r\npatient then returned to England, when the wound rapidly healed after\r\nthe removal of some further necrosed fragments of cancellous tissue. The\r\nastragalus had been reduced to a mere shell of compact tissue, and the\r\nconvexity of the articular surface was altogether lost. The deformity,\r\ntogether with the formation of adhesions in the ankle-joint, led to the\r\ndevelopment of a firm anchylosis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--Pom-pom Percussion Fuse, exact size]\r\n\r\nMy friend Mr. Abbott removed a similar fuse from the substance of the\r\nlung after the lapse of nine months, the patient having developed an\r\nempyema, and a chronic fistula, which rapidly closed after the removal\r\nof the foreign body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXV\r\n\r\nOBLIQUE FRACTURE OF THE HUMERUS CAUSED BY A FRAGMENT OF A VICKERS-MAXIM\r\nOR POM-POM SHELL\r\n\r\nThe entire absence of comminution is very striking]\r\n\r\nI will add one further case, that illustrated by plate XXV. In this a\r\nfragment of a pom-pom shell entered the outer aspect of the right\r\nshoulder to escape on the inner aspect of the arm, just below the\r\nconfines of the axilla. An oblique, non-comminuted fracture of the\r\nhumerus resulted, which in spite of moderate suppuration united well in\r\nthe course of six weeks. The case is of particular interest as\r\nillustrating the nature of the fracture to be expected when the velocity\r\nretained by the missile is low.\r\n\r\nThe above instances show that such peculiarities as belong to wounds\r\nproduced by pom-pom shells depend on the comparatively small size and\r\nweight of the fragments, and on the small degree of impetus with which\r\nthey are propelled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Boer Segment Shell, or Shrapnel. The large\r\nfragment is a piece of the case, the smaller are two of the pieces of\r\niron packed within]\r\n\r\nFig. 95 illustrates a form of shrapnel employed by the Boers, the case\r\nof which is of cast metal arranged in definite segments, while the\r\ninterior is filled with small fragments of iron so shaped as to pack in\r\nconcentric layers. As to the wounds produced by the contained fragments\r\nI have no experience, since I never saw one of the pieces of iron\r\nremoved. This no doubt depended in part on the very unsatisfactory\r\npractice made by the Boers with shrapnel generally. Even when they fired\r\nEnglish shrapnel, the shells were, as a rule, exploded far too high to\r\ncause any serious danger to the men beneath. I saw on one occasion a\r\nlarge number of shrapnel shells exploded over a body of Imperial\r\nYeomanry, but as a result of the great height at which all the shells\r\nwere exploded, not a single casualty resulted.\r\n\r\nThe segment casing of the shell, however, I several times saw removed\r\nfrom the body. The fragment shown in fig. 95 was removed from the\r\nbuttock of a man after one of Lord Methuen's early battles. It may be\r\nremarked that the buttock is rather a common, and also a favourable,\r\nseat for shell wounds with retention of the fragment. This no doubt\r\ndepends on the fact that the buttock is one of the few superficial\r\nregions in which sufficient depth of tissue exists for the retention or\r\nthe passage of so large an object as a fragment of shell.\r\n\r\nFig. 96 is of a number of leaden shrapnel bullets from our own shells. A\r\nnormal undeformed bullet, such as was the usual cause of wounds, is\r\nshown at the left-hand upper corner. The remainder show common forms of\r\ndeformity caused by striking on the ground or against rocks. I attribute\r\nsmall importance to the deformed bullets, as I never saw one removed,\r\nand it is probable that a ricochet shrapnel bullet would rarely retain\r\nsufficient force to penetrate. The lower fragments are inserted to\r\nillustrate a fact that would scarcely have been assumed, that these\r\nbullets on impact occasionally suffer a fracture of a somewhat\r\ncrystalline nature. The occurrence of this gross form of fracture is of\r\nsome interest in relation to the extreme fragmentation sometimes\r\nundergone by the hardened leaden cores of the small-calibre bullets.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of wounds from leaden shrapnel bullets were met\r\nwith among our own men, as well as among the Boers. The wounds possessed\r\nlittle special interest, except from the fact that the bullets were\r\noften retained. I saw bullets in the chest on several occasions, also in\r\nthe abdomen, pelvis, the neighbourhood of joints, and in the limbs.\r\n\r\nI saw one patient who had suffered no less than six perforating wounds\r\nas the result of the bursting of one shrapnel shell.\r\n\r\nI will here quote one case of interest as completing the various forms\r\nof perforating wound of the abdomen met with during the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Normal, Deformed, and Fractured Leaden Shrapnel\r\nBullets]\r\n\r\n     (212) _Perforating shrapnel-wound of abdomen._--Boer wounded at\r\n     Graspan. Aperture of _entry_ (shrapnel), opposite eighth left\r\n     costal cartilage, 1 inch external to nipple line. The opening\r\n     was circular, and surrounded by an area of ecchymosis 4 inches\r\n     in diameter; _exit_, 4-1/2 inches above and to the right of the\r\n     umbilicus. Patient was at first in a Boer ambulance, and only\r\n     seen by me on the ninth day. At that date he was dressed and\r\n     walking with a gauze pad and bandage over the wounds. From the\r\n     exit wound, which was 1 inch in diameter, protruded a piece of\r\n     sloughing omentum, the margin of the wound being everted and\r\n     raised over a circular indurated area.\r\n\r\n     It was thought best to allow the sloughing omentum, which was\r\n     very foul, to separate spontaneously, and then to return the\r\n     stump. At the end of three weeks, however, the slough had not\r\n     only separated, but the stump had retracted, and only a small\r\n     granulating surface was left, which healed spontaneously.\r\n\r\nI have little to say regarding the treatment of shell wounds. The\r\nmutilating injuries, if not of a fatal character, necessitated treatment\r\nof a corresponding nature to the damage. In all such cases the general\r\nrules of surgery indicate the lines to be followed.\r\n\r\nIn the case of shrapnel wounds the bullets were often better removed;\r\nbut when in dangerous positions, as sunk deeply in the chest, abdomen,\r\nor pelvis, they were best left, unless some very special indication for\r\nremoval existed. Large fragments of shell always demanded removal.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I will only make the further remark, that shell wounds,\r\nwith the exception of clean leaden shrapnel tracks, always suppurated.\r\n\r\nI make this closing statement with the view of emphasising the influence\r\nexerted on the aseptic course of modern rifle wounds by the small\r\ncalibre of the bullet, since both bullet and shell wounds were exposed\r\nto the same surrounding conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbdomen, injuries to, 407\r\n  General prognosis in, 470\r\n\r\nAbdominal wounds:\r\n  Explosive, 414\r\n  Non-perforating, 409\r\n  Perforating, 411\r\n\r\nAbscess of the brain, 287\r\n\r\nAcetabulum, fracture of, 193\r\n\r\nAcetylene light, 30\r\n\r\nAmbulance:\r\n  Foreign, 30\r\n  Trolly (McCormack-Brook), 18\r\n  Wagons, 19\r\n\r\nAmputations:\r\n  Effect of transport on, 110\r\n  for fracture, 177\r\n\r\nAneurisms:\r\n  Effect of rest on, 127\r\n  Gangrene after, 152\r\n  Traumatic, 122\r\n    False, 123\r\n    True, 126\r\n  Treatment of, 127\r\n\r\nAneurismal varix:\r\n  Arm and forearm, 147\r\n  Effect on circulation, 134\r\n  Carotid, 146\r\n  Femoral, 147\r\n  Mode of development, 130\r\n  Popliteal, 147\r\n  Prognosis in, 144\r\n  Signs of, 131\r\n  Treatment of, 144\r\n\r\nAnosmia, 348\r\n\r\nAntrum, wounds of, 306\r\n\r\nAphasia:\r\n  Amnesic, 276\r\n  Ataxic, 273\r\n  Functional, 351\r\n\r\nArterial haematoma, 123\r\n  Prognosis in, 126\r\n  Treatment of, 126\r\n\r\nArteries:\r\n  Compression by cicatrices, 113\r\n  Contusion of, 112\r\n  Division of, 114\r\n  Perforation of, 114\r\n\r\nArterio-venous aneurism:\r\n  Arm and forearm, 150\r\n  Cervical, 149\r\n  Femoral, 150\r\n  Leg, 150\r\n  Popliteal, 151\r\n  Treatment of, 148\r\n\r\n\r\nBiliary fistula, 467\r\n\r\nBladder:\r\n  Wounds of, 443, 457\r\n  Extra-peritoneal, 458\r\n  Intra-peritoneal, 457\r\n  Retained bullet in, 110, 460\r\n\r\nBones.
