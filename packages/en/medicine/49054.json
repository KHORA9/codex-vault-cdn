We have included in this work a\r\ncrystallization of essential information without which, the embalmer\r\nmust be poorly equipped to carry out the many duties incident to his\r\ncalling in a manner satisfactory to his patrons and to himself.\r\n\r\nHaving been thrown in contact with the many problems surrounding the\r\neducation of the embalmer, the authors have gained many ideas as to\r\njust how to place the information before the embalmer so that the\r\nresult will be reflected in an increased capacity for good work on the\r\npart of the individual embalmer.\r\n\r\nIn prescribing information for the embalmer in this manner, we know\r\nclearly just what is to be expected from the application of the\r\nsciences herein described, and wish for the novitiate and practitioner\r\nthe same enthusiasm for actual knowledge that has helped us thus far in\r\narranging the information.\r\n\r\nIn =Part One=, we have chronicled, from the word of historians and men\r\nof the present day, a condensed, yet complete exposition of the funeral\r\ncustoms relating to the care of the dead, giving our readers a better\r\nunderstanding of present methods by reason of an opportunity to compare\r\nthem with those of the past.\r\n\r\nIn =Part Two=, we have placed the ground work or foundation for the\r\nsecuring of the proper education in embalming. The work on Anatomy,\r\nwhich, if mastered by the student or practitioner, is by far the\r\ngreatest lever in helping him to master his lifework.\r\n\r\nIn =Part Three=, we have placed the practical application of the\r\nprinciples of modern embalming, tempered by the use of the sciences of\r\npathology, bacteriology, and chemistry in our own application of the\r\nwork and in its transcription to these pages.\r\n\r\nIn formulating the technical part of the work, we have been greatly\r\nassisted by many authorities among whom are:—Green, Howell, Thomas,\r\nPiersol, Gray, Spalteholz, Myers, Barnes, Renouard, Clarke, and those\r\nauthors who have from time to time contributed articles to the current\r\nembalmers journals. We are deeply indebted to these men for the results\r\nof their work.\r\n\r\nWe have based the treatments given herein on the following\r\nclassification of embalming fluid as expressed in the percentage\r\nstrength of formaldehyde gas contained within the fluid.\r\n\r\n       ½ strength = standard fluid of 5% diluted to 2½%\r\n       ¾ strength = standard fluid of 5% diluted to 3¾%\r\n  Normal strength = standard fluid 5%\r\n      1¼ strength = standard fluid of 5% raised to 6¼%\r\n\r\nAs the existence of a calling or profession depends on a constant\r\nassimilation of newly discovered information counterbalanced by the\r\nthrowing off of that which has been found faulty, we commend this book\r\nto the embalmer and hope that it will meet with all the requirements of\r\nthe higher education, for which we are constantly battling.\r\n\r\n                                                         THE AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART

They were silent on desiccation in\r\nthe act of mummification, but it is to be regarded as a simple omission\r\non their part. This desiccation was continued during the seventy days\r\nof preparation, and it constituted the principle part of the process\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThe details that I am about to give are extracted from the work of M.\r\nBory de Saint Vincent on the fortunate Isles.\r\n\r\n“The arts of the Guanches were not numerous, the most singular without\r\ndoubt is that of embalming. The Guanches preserved the remains of their\r\nrelations in a scrupulous manner and spared no pains to guarantee them\r\nfrom corruption. As a moral duty each individual prepared for himself\r\nthe skins of goats, in which his remains could be enveloped, and which\r\nmight serve him for sepulture. These skins were often divested of their\r\nhair, at other times they permitted it to remain, when they placed\r\nindifferently the hair side within or without. The processes to which\r\nthey resorted to make perfect mummies, which they named _xaxos_, are\r\nnearly lost.\r\n\r\nWith the Guanches, the embalmers were abject beings; men and women\r\nfilled this employment respectively, for their sexes; they were well\r\npaid, but their touch was considered contamination; and all who were\r\noccupied in preparing the xaxos lived retired, solitary, and out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nThere were several kinds of embalming, and several different\r\nemployments for those who had charge of it. When they had need of\r\nthe services of the embalmers, they carried the body to them to be\r\npreserved, and immediately retired. If the body belonged to persons\r\ncapable of bearing the expenses, they extended it at first on a stone\r\ntable, the operator then made an opening in the lower part of the\r\nbelly with a sharpened flint, wrought into the form of a knife and\r\ncalled _tabona_; the intestines were withdrawn, which other operators\r\nafterwards washed and cleaned; they also washed the rest of the body,\r\nand particularly the delicate parts, as the eyes, interior of the\r\nmouth, the ears, and the nails, with fresh water saturated with salt.\r\nThey filled the large cavities with aromatic plants; they then exposed\r\nthe body to the hottest sun, or placed it in stoves, if the sun was not\r\nhot enough. During the exposition they frequently endued the body with\r\nan ointment, composed of goats' grease, powder of odoriferous plants,\r\npine bark, resin, tar ponce stone, and other absorbing material.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth day the embalming should be completely terminated; the\r\nmummy should be dry and light; the relatives send for it and establish\r\nthe most magnificent obsequies in their power. They sew up the body in\r\nseveral folds of skin, which they had prepared while living, and they\r\nbind it with straps.\r\n\r\nThe kings and the grandees were besides placed in a case or coffin of a\r\nsingle piece, and hollowed out of the trunk of a juniper tree, the wood\r\nof which was held as incorruptible.\r\n\r\nThey then finally carried the xaxos, thus sewed and encased, to\r\ninaccessible grottoes consecrated to this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Egyptian Embalming.=—The Egyptians embalmed their dead, and the\r\nprocesses which they employed were sufficiently perfect to secure\r\nthem an indefinite preservation. This is a fact which the pyramids,\r\nthe cavern, and all the sepultures of Egypt offer us irrefragible\r\nproof. But what were the causes of the origin of this custom? We have\r\nin answer only hypothesis and conjecture. In the absence of valid\r\ndocuments, each one explains according to the bias of his mind, or\r\nthe nature of his studies, a usage, the origin of which is lost in the\r\nnight of time. One of the ancients informs us that the Egyptians took\r\nso much pains for the preservation of the body, believing that the\r\nsoul inhabited it so long as it subsisted. Cassien, on the other hand,\r\nassures us that they invented this method because they were unable\r\nto bury their dead during the period of inundation. Herodotus, in his\r\nthird book, observes, that embalming had for its object the securing\r\nof bodies from the voracity of animals; they did not bury them, says\r\nhe, for fear they would be eaten by worms, and they did not burn them,\r\nbecause they considered fire like a wild beast that devours everything\r\nit can seize upon. Filial piety and respect for the dead, according\r\nto Sicculus, were the sentiments which inspired the Egyptians with the\r\nidea of embalming the dead bodies. De Maillet, in his tenth letter upon\r\nEgypt, refers only to a religious motive as the origin of embalming:\r\nThe priests and sages of Egypt taught their fellow citizens that,\r\nafter a certain number of ages, which they made to amount to thirty\r\nor forty thousand years, and at which they fixed the epoch of the\r\ngrand revolution when the earth would return to the point at which it\r\ncommenced its existence, their souls would return to the same bodies\r\nwhich they formerly inhabited. But in order to arrive, after death, to\r\nthis wished for resurrection, two things were absolutely necessary;\r\nfirst that the bodies should be absolutely carefully preserved from\r\ncorruption, in order that the souls might re-inhabit them; secondly,\r\nthat the penance submitted to during this long period of years, that\r\nthe numerous sacrifices founded by the dead, or those offered to their\r\nnames by their friends, or relation, should expiate the crimes they had\r\ncommitted during the time of their first inhabitation on earth.\r\n\r\nWith these conditions exactly observed, these souls separate from their\r\nbodies, should be permitted to re-enter at the arrival of this grand\r\nrevolution which they anticipated—remember all that had passed during\r\ntheir sojourn, and become immortal like themselves. They had further\r\nthe same privilege of communicating this same happiness to the animals\r\nwhich they had cherished, provided that their bodies inclosed in the\r\nsame tomb with themselves, were equally well preserved. It is in virtue\r\nof this belief that so many birds, cats, and other animals are found\r\nembalmed with almost the same care as the human bodies with which they\r\nhave been deposited.\r\n\r\nSuch was the idea of perfect happiness which they hoped to enjoy\r\nin this new life. Surely superstition alone, it could scarcely be\r\nbelieved, would induce men to save from destruction the mortal spoils\r\nof individuals whom they had loved whilst living. We much prefer\r\nlooking for the source of this usage in the sentiment which survives\r\na cherished object snatched from affection by the hand of death.\r\nSince death levels all distinctions—respecting neither love nor\r\nfriendship—since the dearest and most sacred ties are relentlessly\r\nbroken asunder, it is the natural attribute of affection, to seek to\r\navoid in some degree, a painful separation, by preserving the remains\r\nof those they loved and by whom they were beloved. This according to\r\nSaint Vincent. Volney and Paraset write as follows as to the probable\r\ncause of the origin of the custom: In a numerous population, under a\r\nburning climate, and the soil profoundly drenched during many months\r\nof the year, the rapid putrefaction of bodies, is a leaven for plague\r\nand disease. Stricken by these numerous pests, Egypt at an early\r\nday, struggled to obviate them; hence have arisen, on the one hand a\r\ncustom of burying their dead at a distance from their habitations; and\r\non the other an art so ingenious and simple to prevent putrefaction\r\nby embalming. One individual may be induced to embalm the bodies of\r\nhis relatives and friends by motives of superstition; another from\r\negotism and personal interest; a third from motives of salubrity or\r\ncommon interest; another is impelled to perform the sacred duty of\r\npreserving the remains of those who were dear to him by an instinctive\r\naffection. Caylus says that the Egyptians, according to appearances owe\r\nthe idea of their mummies, to the dead bodies which they found buried\r\nin the burning sands which prevail in some parts of Egypt, and which,\r\ncarried away by the winds, bury travelers and preserve their bodies, by\r\nconsuming the fat and flesh without altering the skin.\r\n\r\nThe mourning, embalming and funerals were conducted as follows: When\r\na man of consideration dies, all the women of his house, cover the\r\nhead and even the face with mud; they leave the deceased in the house,\r\ngirdle the middle of their bodies, bare the bosom, strike the breast,\r\nand overrun the city, accompanied by their relations. On the other\r\nside, the men also girdle themselves, and strike their breasts; after\r\nthis ceremony they carry the body to the place where it is to be\r\nembalmed.\r\n\r\nCertain men according to the law have charge of the embalming, and\r\nmake a profession of it. When a body is brought to them, they show\r\nthe bearers models of the dead in wood. The most renowned represents,\r\nthey say, _Him whose name I am scrupulous to mention_. This model\r\nwas probably the figure of some divinity. To be prepared after this\r\nmodel would cost one talent, (about nine hundred dollars of our\r\nmoney). They show a second which is inferior to the first, and which\r\nis not so costly, twenty mina, (or about three hundred dollars in our\r\nmoney). They also show a third of lower price, the price of which was\r\nconsidered by Herodotus as a trifle, which we would infer to mean from\r\nfifty to seventy-five dollars of our money. The exhibition of models\r\non the part of the embalmers, had reference to the richness of the\r\nwork demanded, and to the expense of the chosen form. They demand after\r\nwhich of the three models they wish the deceased to be embalmed. After\r\nagreeing about the price, the relatives retire; the embalmers work\r\nalone and proceed as follows, in the most costly embalming.\r\n\r\nThey first withdraw the brain through the nostrils, in part with a\r\ncurved iron instrument, and in part by means of drugs, which they\r\nintroduce into the head. They now make an incision in the flank with\r\na sharp Ethiopian stone. The body is extended upon the earth, the\r\nscribe traces on the left flank the portion to be cut out. He who\r\nis charged with making the incision cuts with an Ethiopian stone, as\r\nmuch as the law allows; which, having done, he runs off with all his\r\nmight, the assistants follow, throwing stones after him, loading him\r\nwith imprecations, as if they wished to put upon him this crime. They\r\nregard, indeed, with horror, whoever does violence to a body of the\r\nsame nature as their own.\r\n\r\nThey withdraw the intestines through this opening, clean them, and pass\r\nthem through palm wine, place them in a trunk; and among other things\r\nthey do for the deceased, they take this trunk, and calling the sun to\r\nwitness, one of the embalmers on the part of the dead, addresses that\r\nluminary in the following words, which Euphantus has translated: “Sun\r\nand ye too, Gods, who have given life to men, receive me, and grant\r\nthat I may live with the eternal Gods: I have persisted all my life\r\nin the worship of those Gods, whom I hold from my fathers, I have ever\r\nhonoured the Author of my being, I have killed no one, I have committed\r\nno breach of trust, I have done no other evil: if I have been guilty of\r\nany other fault during life, it has not been on my own account, but for\r\nthese things.” The embalmer in finishing these words, shows the trunk\r\ncontaining the intestines, and afterwards casts it into the river. As\r\nto the rest of the body when it is pure they embalm it.\r\n\r\nAfterwards they fill the body with pure bruised myrrh, with cannella\r\nand other perfumes, excepting incense, it is then sown up. When that\r\nis done they salt the body by covering it with natrum for seventy days.\r\nThe natrum carries off and dries the oily, lymphatic, and greasy parts.\r\nAfter the seventy days the body is not permitted to remain longer in\r\nthe salt. The seventy days elapsed, they wash the body and entirely\r\nenvelope it in linen and cotton bandages, soaked with gum Arabic. The\r\nrelatives now reclaim the body, they have made a wooden case for the\r\nhuman form, in which they enclose the corpse, and put it in a chamber\r\ndestined for this purpose, standing erect against the wall. Such is the\r\nmost magnificent method of embalming the dead.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to avoid the expense, choose this other method; they\r\nfill syringes with an unctious liquor which they obtain from the\r\ncedar, with this they inject the belly of the corpse without making any\r\nincision, and without withdrawing the intestines; when this liquor has\r\nbeen introduced into the cavity, they cork it; the body is then salted\r\nfor the prescribed time. The last day they draw off from the body the\r\ninjected liquor, it has such strength that it dissolves the ventricles\r\nand intestines, which come away with the liquid. The natrum destroys\r\nthe flesh, and there remains of the body only the skin and the bones.\r\nThis operation finished, they return the body without doing anything\r\nfurther to it.\r\n\r\nThe third kind of embalming is only for the poorer classes of society,\r\nthey inject the body with a fluid called surmata, they put the body\r\nin natrum for seventy days, and they afterwards return it to those who\r\nbrought it.\r\n\r\nAs to the ladies of quality, when they are dead, they are not\r\nimmediately sent to the embalmers, any more than such as are beautiful\r\nor highly distinguished; they are reserved for three or four days after\r\ndeath. They take this precaution lest the embalmers might pollute the\r\nbodies confided to their care.\r\n\r\nThe relatives now fix the day for the obsequies in order that the\r\njudges, the relations, and the friends of the dead may be present,\r\nand they characterize it by saying that he is going to pass the lake;\r\nafterwards the judges, to the number of more than forty arriving,\r\nplace themselves in the form of a semicircle beyond the lake. A bateau\r\napproaches, carrying those who have charge of the ceremony, and in\r\nwhich is a sailor whom the Egyptians name in their language, Charon.\r\nBefore placing in the bateau the coffin containing the body of the\r\ndeceased, it is lawful for each one present to accuse him. If they\r\nprove that he has led a sinful life, the judges condemn him, and he\r\nis excluded from the place of his sepulture, if it appear that he has\r\nbeen unjustly accused, they punish the accuser with severity. If no\r\naccuser presents himself or if the one who does so is known to be a\r\ncalumniator, the relatives, putting aside the signs of their grief,\r\ndeliver an eulogism, on the deceased without mentioning his birth,\r\nbecause they consider all Egyptians equally noble. They enlarge on the\r\nmanner in which he has been schooled and instructed from his childhood;\r\nupon his piety, justice, temperance, and his other virtues since he\r\nattained manhood, and they pray the Gods of hell to admit him into the\r\ndwelling of the pious. The people applauded and glorified the dead who\r\nwere to pass all eternity in the abodes of the happy. If any one has a\r\nmonument destined for his sepulture, his body is there deposited; if\r\nhe has none, they construct a room in his house, and place the bier\r\nupright against the most solid part of the wall. They place in their\r\nhouses those to whom sepulture has not been awarded, either on account\r\nof crimes, of which they are accused, or on account of the debts which\r\nthey may have contracted; and it happens sometimes in the end that they\r\nobtained honorable sepulture, their children or descendants becoming\r\nrich, pay their debts or absolve them.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian embalmers knew how to distinguish from the other viscera,\r\nthe liver, the spleen, and the kidneys, which they did not disturb;\r\nthey had discovered the means of withdrawing the brain from the\r\ninterior of the body without destroying the bones of the cranium;\r\nthey knew the action of alkalies upon animal matter, since the time\r\nwas strictly limited that the body could remain in contact with these\r\nsubstances; they were not ignorant of the property of balsams, and\r\nresins to protect the bodies from the larvae of insects and mites;\r\nthey were likewise aware of the necessity of enveloping the dried and\r\nembalmed bodies, in order to protect them from the humidity, which\r\nwould interfere with their preservation.\r\n\r\nThe preceding is a description of ancient Egyptian embalming as given\r\nby Herodotus, and has been the subject of numerous commentations,\r\ndiscussions and researches. It is almost a positive fact that Herodotus\r\nhas omitted desiccation, and that it naturally took place during\r\nthe time consecrated to preparation. From the mummies examined it is\r\nbelieved now that the body was first salted for seventy days, then\r\ndried, and that it was not until after this desiccation that the\r\nresinous and balsamic substances were applied. A simple inspection\r\nof the mummies is sufficient to confirm this opinion and besides what\r\nuse would have been these resinous matters, with which the alkali of\r\nthe natrum would soon form a soapy mass, which the lotions would have\r\ncarried off, at least in great part? It is much more reasonable to\r\nsuppose that these balsamic and resinous substances were not applied to\r\nthe bodies until after they were withdrawn from the natrum.\r\n\r\nAll the ancients agree, in saying that the Egyptians made use of\r\nthe various aromatics to embalm the dead; that they employed for the\r\nrich myrrh, aloes, canella, and cassia lignea; and for the poor, the\r\ncedria, bitumen, and natrum. The natrum was a mixture of carbonate,\r\nsulphate, and muriate of soda. It was a fixed alkali, which acted after\r\nthe manner of quicklime; despoiling the bodies of their lymphatic,\r\nand greasy fluids, leaving only the fibrous and solid parts. The\r\nodoriferous resins and bitumen not only preserved from destruction, but\r\nalso kept at a distance the worms and beetles which devour dead bodies.\r\n\r\nThe embalmers, after having washed the bodies with palm wine, and\r\nhaving filled them with odoriferous resins or bitumen, they place them\r\nin stoves, where by means of convenient heat these resinous substances\r\nunited intimately with the bodies, and these arrive in a very little\r\ntime to that state of perfect preservation which we find them at\r\nthe present day. This operation of which no historian has spoken,\r\nwas, without doubt, the principle and most important part of their\r\nembalming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEMBALMING FROM EGYPTIANS DOWN TO CIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere facts are almost entirely wanting and the history of the art we\r\nare studying, can only be followed in the recitals of historians, to\r\ncontrol whose veracity we have no longer those monuments which Egypt\r\noffers us in such great numbers. Among the Jews, the Greeks, the\r\nRomans, and all modern nations, we see the honors of embalming accorded\r\nto Kings, Princes and men of distinction, but no tomb that has been\r\nopened, has rendered a single mummy so perfect, as those which we\r\nadmire among the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Jews.=—The Jewish people, who, like others, testified their respect\r\nfor the dead, never admit the care of embalming the body as a common\r\nusage. Thus Abraham purchased the field where Sarah was buried;\r\nJoseph had the body of his father magnificently embalmed; Moses only\r\ncarried away the bones of Joseph; David praised the people of Gilead,\r\nfor having buried with pomp Saul and his sons, etc. In most of these\r\nexamples, no mention is made of embalming; nevertheless, the body of\r\nJesus Christ was embalmed. It is written that Joseph of Arimathea,\r\na secret disciple, and Nicodemus, ministered unto him, after the\r\ncrucifixion, and that 100 lbs. of myrrh and aloes were used. In this\r\naction the greatest secrecy had been observed, for “when the Sabbath\r\nwas over, very early on the first day of the next week, came the\r\nfaithful women who had loved him, with spices and ointment they had\r\nprepared where with to annoint him, not knowing that, already, this\r\nloving service had been performed by the hand of pious affection.”\r\n\r\nThe following is nearly the method used by the Jews: Each sex took\r\ncare of its dead; they first of all, close the mouth and eyes of the\r\nexposed person, afterward they washed the body and then rubbed it with\r\nperfumes, tied it with bands, and then bandaged it in several cloths of\r\nvery fine linen or woolen; and finally, they put it into the sepulture.\r\nIt is thought that the myrrh and aloes which they employed had very\r\nlittle virtue to resist putrefaction, and that the great quantities of\r\naromatics which they consumed, was rather for pomp, than for the long\r\npreservation of the subject. They took no pains to dry the body; they\r\ndid not take away the intestines, and in spite of all these odoriferous\r\ndrugs, decomposition must have soon revealed itself as was testified by\r\nthe body of Lazarus when resurrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Persians.=—Neither did the Persians possess a very great knowledge\r\nof preservation. Cyrus, King of Persia, said to his children: “when I\r\nhave ceased to live, place my body neither in silver nor in gold, nor\r\nin any other coffin, but return it immediately to the earth, etc.” It\r\nwill be perceived that Cyrus, in forbidding that any care should be\r\ntaken with his body, does not allude to embalming, which, of all other\r\nmeans, would have been the most efficient in preventing its elements\r\nfrom returning to the Common Mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Babylonians.=—The Babylonians, anointed the bodies of their dead\r\nwith honey, after which, they were immersed in the same substance. It\r\nis highly improbable that this process was successful for long time\r\npreservation, for the preservative power of honey was only equal to its\r\nability to keep the air from the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scythians.=—The Scythians coated the bodies of their dead with\r\nwax. This process could not have been successful excepting to retard\r\ndecomposition through shutting off all communication between the body\r\nand the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ethiopians.=—The Ethiopians coated the bodies of their dead with waxy\r\ncovering called parget. The same comment given on the Babylonian and\r\nScythian processes must also be used here.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Romans.=—The disposition of the dead among the Romans embraced the\r\nfollowing treatment: the deceased was first washed with hot water\r\nvaried with oil, at intervals, for seven days; was dressed and embalmed\r\nwith the performance of a variety of singular ceremonies. Cremation\r\nwas then the means of ultimate disposal of the dead, the ashes being\r\ngathered and placed in urns and then the urns, in turn, were placed in\r\ntombs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Greeks.=—Homer describes cremation, as an honorable mode of sepulture\r\npracticed in the heroic ages. Later from their many conquests, the\r\nGreeks acquired the art of embalming patterned after the Arabian and\r\nAssyrian-Persian methods, of which we have no record.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Norsemen.=—It appears from the sages that a form of cremation was used\r\nby the early Norsemen, who used to place the viking in his ship and\r\nsend him “flaming out to sea.” Later it became the custom to place him,\r\nwith all his belongings, in his vessel set on an even keel, and entomb\r\nhim beneath a mound of earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hindoos.=—Suttee (from Sati-a virtuous wife), an Indian custom,\r\ninvolving the burning of widows on the same funeral pyre as the\r\nhusband, was the rule until 1829 A. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n=French and Belgians.=—Paleolithic cave dwellers of France and\r\nBelgium buried their dead in natural caves or crevices, like those in\r\nwhich they lived. Later stone-age people throughout Europe buried in\r\nchambered barrows or cairns. Bronze age people buried in unchambered\r\nbarrows or in cemeteries of stone cists set in the ground often on a\r\nnatural eminence, and surrounded by circles of standing stones. The\r\ncist was formed of a double row of stones covered with rude stone\r\nslabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Britains.=—Neolithic tribes in Britain buried either in caves or in\r\nchambered tombs, probably representing the huts of the living. Some of\r\nthese barrows are very elaborate and massive; that of West Kennett is\r\nsaid to be 350 feet long. The dead were buried in the British tombs as\r\nthey died, or in a contracted posture, probably due to their habit of\r\nsleeping in this position, and not at full length on a bed. Many cleft\r\nskulls are found in these tombs, suggesting human sacrifice, which as\r\nCaesar tells us, was prevalent among the Gauls. The bronze age usages\r\nwere divided between burying and cremation. In burying, the contracted\r\nposture was followed. In cremation, the body was placed in a coffin\r\nmade of the hollow trunk of an oak, split in two. In cremation, the\r\nashes were collected in a funeral urn, twelve to eighteen inches high\r\nand were placed in a chamber. Articles of daily use were thrown into\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peruvians.=—The aborigines of the western continent were familiar with\r\nembalming. Prescott's “Conquest of Peru” tells that the royal “Incas”\r\nof Peru, were preserved by some process which did not give evidence\r\nof an external application. These bodies were then secreted under\r\nmounds of earth and in the interior of the temples. Prescott presents\r\nhighly interesting pictures of these embalmed Peruvian monarchs sitting\r\n“natural as life,” in the chairs of the temples of the sun, at Cusco.\r\nThey were clothed as in life, the raven black hair on their heads was\r\nstill unchanged, and their hands were crossed upon their bosoms in the\r\ngrim dignity of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aztecs.=—The Aztecs, who were highly civilized, and were one of\r\nthe most interesting and powerful tribes of early America, inhabited\r\nMexico. The Aztecs were conquered by Cortez in 1519. Their history\r\nhas been traced back to the twelfth century. The bodies of their dead,\r\nespecially of those who could claim royal descent, were embalmed. It\r\nis related in Aztec legends how, after the deluge, seven persons came\r\nforth from the tomb to which their mummified bodies had been committed,\r\nand, in renewed existence, repeopled the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n=North American Indians.=—Even our own North American Indians knew\r\nthe art of embalming. Mummies remarkably well preserved have been\r\nfound among the Flat Heads, Dakotas and Chinooks; and the Florida and\r\nVirginia Indians preserved the bodies of their Kings in the same way.\r\nThe Kentucky caves have given up some remarkable specimens of this\r\nkind. The bodies of a woman and child were, in 1899, found in a cave\r\nin the Yosemite valley, and which, on account of its size (six feet and\r\neight inches), some authorities believe to be a relic of the lost tribe\r\nof the stone age, possibly antedating the Christian era 3,000 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early Christians.=—For a time the early Christians embalmed the bodies\r\nof their dead, using these forms with which they were familiar in\r\nPalestine. After a time, however, they gave up the practice. It has\r\nbeen said that they feared by the continuation of the process to cast\r\ndiscredit upon the power of God to call together the scattered dust of\r\nthe body which had returned to its native element, and present it, like\r\nunto Christ's own glorious body, on the morning of the resurrection. No\r\nword spoken by Jesus, would indicate that he disapproved of methods,\r\nwith which he as a Jew was familiar, to preserve the body from decay.\r\nDuring the first four centuries of the Christian era, the catacombs\r\nat Rome were used for burial. These catacombs consist of subterranean\r\nexcavations, long horizontal passages with recesses on either side,\r\narrayed in tiers for the reception of bodies, closed in by slabs\r\nbearing inscriptions and emblems of the faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Later European Embalming.=—After the previous discussion of the care\r\nof the dead affecting prehistoric as well as the earliest historic\r\nusages, we are brought forward to the seventeenth century. All\r\nembalming processes of the earlier days having been forgotten during\r\nthe dark ages. The slow but sure development of the medical profession\r\nhaving manifested a dire necessity for the preservation of anatomical\r\nmaterial, this necessity was first met by Dr. Frederick Ruysch,\r\nwho occupied the chair of anatomy at Amsterdam, Holland, during the\r\nclose of the seventeenth and early years of the eighteenth century\r\n(1665-1717).\r\n\r\nDr. Ruysch was probably the first to practice a successful system of\r\narterial injection, in order that his anatomical specimens might resist\r\nthe processes of decay. The reader should understand that embalming\r\nas a convenient process for preserving human dead bodies for funeral\r\npurposes had not been thought of at this time, and the principal\r\ninterest in embalming was for its successful preservation of anatomical\r\nspecimens. The method followed by Dr. Ruysch, was first an arterial\r\ninjection, then allowing the diffusion of the fluid for some hours,\r\nafter which, he proceeded to open the body as in making a postmortem\r\nexamination, removing the viscera, cleaning them and replacing them\r\nsurrounded with a preservative solution. Dr. Ruysch died, leaving his\r\nsecrets buried with him, and they were lost to science.\r\n\r\nDr. William Hunter, an eminent Scottish physician, anatomist and\r\nphysiologist of the eighteenth century (1718-1783) is given credit\r\nby many as being the original inventor of the injection system, for\r\nhe published his plan of injection in minute detail, so that science\r\nmight benefit thereby. The artery usually selected by Dr. Hunter was\r\nthe femoral and his solution was composed of oil of turpentine five\r\npints; Venice turpentine, one pint; oil of lavender, two fluid ounces;\r\noil of rosemary, two fluid ounces; and vermillion. This was forced\r\ninto the vessel until it reached over the whole body, giving the skin\r\na general reddish appearance. As in Dr. Ruysch's method, the body\r\nwas left untouched for a time, and was then opened, the viscera being\r\ntreated and placed back again. After treating the exterior of the body\r\nin some cases, a coffin was prepared and the body was placed on a bed\r\nof dry plaster of paris in order that desiccation might set in. The\r\nbody was then left for four years and if dryness had not set in by that\r\ntime, was placed upon another bed of plaster of paris. Some of Hunter's\r\nspecimens are to be seen today in the museum of the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons, London.\r\n\r\nDr. John Hunter, a younger brother of William, was also very active\r\nin experimentation along these lines, and his work was little less\r\nrenowned along the same lines. The Hunterian method was used for years\r\nby English anatomists with little if any alteration.\r\n\r\nM. Boudet, attempted to use the Egyptian form of procedure in\r\nembalming, using as preservative agents corrosive sublimate, tan, salt,\r\nasphalt, Peruvian bark, camphor, cinnamon, and other aromatics. He\r\ncompletely enveloped the body in bandages, varnish being coated over\r\nthe body and cavities and outer bandages.\r\n\r\nM. Franchini, injected the common carotid artery with a solution made\r\nup of eight decigrams of arsenious acid, combined with a small quantity\r\nof cinnabar, dissolved in nine kilograms of spirits of wine. By this\r\nmethod bodies could be kept odorless and natural in color for sixty\r\ndays, after which desiccation set in.\r\n\r\nJean Nicholas Gannal, and his son Dr. Gannal of Paris, injected\r\nchloride of alumina with success, J. N. Gannal, had previously, a\r\nformula containing arsenic, which the French Government compelled him\r\nto discontinue by prohibiting the sale of the arsenic. In addition\r\nto the above treatment the body was placed in a lead coffin and four\r\nor five litres of various essences were poured over the body and\r\nthe casket was soldered. In this way preservation was said to be\r\nindefinite.\r\n\r\nM. Sucquet, injected a solution of chloride of zinc arterially, and\r\nin one body which was taken up after being buried 14 months achieved\r\nremarkable success, the incident being the result of a contest between\r\nM. Gannal, M. Dupre, and M. Sucquet. This led to the use of the zinc\r\nsalts in fluid, not only in Europe but in this country as well.\r\n\r\nM. Falcony, desiccated the body in a mixture which was composed of saw\r\ndust and powdered zinc sulphate. Bodies so preserved remained flexible\r\nfor about forty days, after which they dried up, although still\r\nretaining their natural color.\r\n\r\nFranciolli, used arsenic acid, four ounces; carbonate of potash, two\r\nounces; powdered alum, eight ounces. He completely eviscerated the body\r\nand then injected it in all directions, afterwards replacing the organs\r\nand surrounding them with liquid preparation composed of corn starch,\r\nwater, alcohol, and corrosive sublimate, which after hardening, would\r\nprevent the sinking of the parts.\r\n\r\nMany processes are noted in the various histories of the art, all\r\nusing the arterial injection, which by this time had become universally\r\naccepted as the only true way of reaching the body tissues completely.\r\nThe reader has noted absolutely nothing as to embalming being the most\r\nconvenient process for funeral purposes. This is left to the following\r\nmatter which begins with the embalming done by Dr. Thomas Holmes during\r\nthe civil war (1861-1865 A. D.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nEMBALMING IN AMERICA AFTER THE CIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Holmes was authorized by the U. S. Government to prepare the bodies\r\nof slain troops, so that they could be transported to their former\r\nhomes. The practice of embalming for funeral purposes received its\r\ngreatest impulse during the regime of Dr. Holmes, and it opened up an\r\nera of unprecedented discovery and success in preserving the dead body.\r\n\r\nAfter Holmes, the man who cared for the dead began to feel that his\r\nwas a professional work worthy of the name. The average undertaker,\r\nat the time just after the civil war, was a cabinet maker, whose chief\r\nfunction was to make the coffin or casket for the body, take the casket\r\nto the house and place the body in it. Then the larger undertakers in\r\nthe larger cities found that they were compelled to preserve some of\r\nthe bodies in some way so that distant relatives could reach the scene\r\nbefore the funeral. This probably was the result of betterments in\r\ntransportation facilities which led people to travel more. Along with\r\nthis, travelers frequently died away from home and had to be shipped.\r\nThe baggage men rightfully objected to remaining in the same enclosed\r\nspace with an unembalmed body and, altogether, a condition arose in\r\nwhich it was necessary to have some way to preserve the body.\r\n\r\nAs evolution is always a slow process, we cannot as we would like to\r\ndo, chronicle the introduction of chemical embalming at this time,\r\nfor refrigeration was the first thing thought of. The ice box, was\r\nthe means by which bodies were kept for several days; the body being\r\ncovered and left that way until a few hours before the funeral. This\r\nbecame so unsatisfactory specially when the sensibilities of the\r\nundertaker became sharpened, that they immediately looked about for a\r\nmore convenient way to handle the situation. Spurred on by this demand,\r\nseveral concerns came into the market with preservative solutions\r\nwith an arsenical base, and which were used principally for external\r\napplication and cavity injection. All kinds of instruments were used\r\nwith which to introduce the fluid into the body cavities until Captain\r\nGeorge Billow, of Akron, Ohio, a civil war veteran, and at present a\r\nmember of the Ohio State Board of Embalming examiners, contrived the\r\npen point trocar, which is still in use among the profession.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the trocar, and the campaigns of the fluid\r\nmanufacturers, trade periodicals and traveling men, cavity embalming\r\nbecame the means of preservation, until its limitations were learned.\r\n\r\nJoseph Henry Clarke, who first traveled for fluid houses, and who was\r\ninterested in the anatomy of the human body, since his connection with\r\nthe U. S. hospital service in the Civil war, determined to introduce\r\nthe arterial injection as the means of placing the fluid through the\r\nbody. In collaboration with Dr. C. M. Lukens, the occupant of the chair\r\nof Anatomy at the Pulte Medical College of Cincinnati, Prof. J. H.\r\nClarke opened a school of embalming naming it the Cincinnati School of\r\nEmbalming. This took place during the year 1882. Prof. Auguste Renouard\r\nof Denver, Colorado, came into the field about the same time. Thus we\r\nhave the beginning of the greatest revolution of all times in the care\r\nof the dead human bodies.\r\n\r\nAfter Prof. Clarke and Prof. Renouard, came Prof. Frank Sullivan, and\r\nfrom time to time the list was augmented by the addition of others,\r\na few of whom being Dr. Eliab Meyers, of Springfield, Ohio, Dr. Carl\r\nL. Barnes of Chicago, etc. With the efforts of all these men, the\r\nundertakers were led to use the arteries more and more until now, at\r\nthe present time, this form of embalming is used exclusively through\r\nthe United States, and Canada; European countries not having, as yet\r\nprogressed as rapidly in that direction. The additions to the work\r\nfrom the time just previous to the start given to it by Prof. Clarke,\r\nnumber all the methods which we use today, including, the injection\r\nof any large artery in the body; the drainage of blood to further the\r\nobtaining of a complete circulation; the various processes by which\r\ndiscolorations are prevented and cured; the various processes by which\r\nbodies are disinfected; the various processes by which features are\r\nrestored and many other of the vital operations of the present time.\r\nThe undertaker having progressed from the cabinet maker, to a man of\r\nprofessional bearing having a good knowledge of all things pertaining\r\nto the dead human body, is now a man in whom the greatest reliance\r\nmay be placed. Where previously, he was uneducated and uncultivated\r\nin matters pertaining to the body, he is now an authority to a great\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nAs a part of this historical contribution, we cannot overlook the very\r\ngreat advance made in the nature and composition of the preservative\r\nsolutions used today. When formaldehyde was introduced, the high cost\r\nof it prevented its immediate use; but, later on, improved methods\r\nof manufacture brought the cost down to such a point where it became\r\nan essential ingredient in the fluids. Later when, on medico-legal\r\ngrounds, arsenic was prohibited in the fluid (this action paralleling\r\nthe action taken by France in the case of J. N. and Dr. Gannal),\r\nformaldehyde was depended upon for the maximum preservative action.\r\nThus it still remains the base of most of the modern fluids. Several\r\ncompounders have discontinued its use, preferring phenol, creosote,\r\netc., but these chemicals have not as yet, made much progress against\r\nthe formaldehyde.\r\n\r\nIn the early days, when the fluids were likely to be inadequate to care\r\nfor certain conditions, the question as to which fluid is to be used\r\nwas the principal care of the embalmer. Today, when the standard fluids\r\nare of the highest possible efficiency, it is a question of knowledge\r\nand technic on the part of the embalmer; it being a recognized fact\r\nthat there is only about 1 chance in 1,000 for a standard fluid to\r\ncontain inferior elements. In this way we may state that the burden of\r\nobtaining success has been shifted from the fluid, to the man using\r\nit; and it is then unnecessary to state that the best preparation\r\nalong the line of education for the embalmer is advised, so that by his\r\nknowledge, he may do what he is expected to do by the people whom he is\r\nserving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nANATOMY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnatomy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word anatomy is derived from two Greek words, meaning, to cut\r\napart, which literally means dissection.\r\n\r\nAnatomy is used to indicate the study of the physical structure of\r\norganized bodies.\r\n\r\n_Anatomy_ is the science of organization or the science of organic\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nHuman anatomy is divided into two great divisions, known as (a) general\r\nor descriptive anatomy and (b) surgical or regional anatomy.\r\n\r\n_Descriptive anatomy_ deals with the separate parts of the human body.\r\n\r\n_Histology_ is that part of descriptive anatomy where the separate\r\nparts of the human body are studied by means of the microscope.\r\n\r\n_Osteology_ is that part of descriptive anatomy describing the number,\r\nform, structure and uses of bone.\r\n\r\n_Myology_ is that part of descriptive anatomy which treats of muscles.\r\n\r\n_Neurology_ is that part of descriptive anatomy which treats of nerves.\r\n\r\n_Syndesmology_ is that part of descriptive anatomy which treats of\r\nligaments.\r\n\r\n_Angiology_ is that part of descriptive anatomy which treats of the\r\nblood-vessels and lymphatics.\r\n\r\n_Surgical or regional anatomy_ describes the relation which certain\r\nparts,—muscles, nerves, arteries, etc.,—bear to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHISTOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Histology is that part of descriptive anatomy which\r\ntreats of the intimate structure of the tissues as seen under the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nHistology as taught in most professional schools constitutes a one\r\nyear's course, but for the embalmer this is not entirely necessary\r\nand with the short term of schooling now existing it is quite\r\nimpossible, but certain of the fundamental principles of histology are\r\nimportant. For this reason a few of the more important tissues have\r\nbeen discussed, not, however, in great detail, but only superficially,\r\nmerely to have the embalmer acquainted with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Cell.=—A cell is defined as a nucleated mass of protoplasm endowed\r\nwith the attributes of life.\r\n\r\n_Protoplasm_ is the name applied to the semi-fluid, granular substance\r\ncontained within the cell.\r\n\r\nThe simplest forms of animal life are organisms consisting of only one\r\ncell which are called _protozoa_.\r\n\r\nCells having similar shape and similar functions are grouped to form\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nTissues are grouped together to form organs.\r\n\r\nEvery cell consists of a cell body and a nucleus. The cell body\r\nconsists of a substance known as protoplasm. The nucleus is the\r\nessential part of a typical cell and is the controlling center of its\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 1—A, A vertical section of the cuticle; B,\r\n   the lateral view of the cells; C, the flat side of scales like\r\n   (d) magnified 250 diameters.]\r\n\r\nCells divide or reproduce themselves by means of direct or indirect\r\ndivision. In direct division the nucleus and the cell wall simply\r\ndivide into two equal divisions and results in the formation of two\r\nnew cells. In indirect division the process is much more complicated,\r\nand several stages must be passed through before there is a complete\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nThe process of fertilization consists in the conjugation of two sexual\r\ncells. The male sexual cell is called the spermatazoon, and the female\r\nsexual cell is called the ovum.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of the ovum in its earlier development stages is known as\r\nthe germinal vessicle.\r\n\r\nIn the living organism many cells are destroyed during the various\r\nphysiologic processes and are replaced by new ones. When a cell\r\ndies, changes take place in the nucleus which result in its gradual\r\ndisappearance. This process is known as chromatolysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tissues.=—A _tissue_ is an aggregate of cells all having a common\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nThose important tissues with which the embalmer should be more or less\r\nacquainted are the following:\r\n\r\nSkin, nails, hair, superficial fascia, deep fascia, lymphatics,\r\nglands, cartilage, bone, teeth, nerves, muscles, tendons, aponeuroses,\r\nligaments, fat, mucous membranes, serous membranes, synovial membranes,\r\narteries, veins and blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Skin.=—The skin or integument (intego, to cover) is the outside\r\ncovering of the human body. It is the first tissue that is cut when\r\noperating upon the body.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 2—A cross section of the skin. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nThe skin is the seat of the organs of touch. The multitudes of sensory\r\nnerve endings convey the sensations of temperature, pressure and pain\r\nto the brain, thus informing the brain at all times, to keep the body\r\nfrom harm, and in a strong and healthful condition.\r\n\r\nThe skin is also the regulator of the body temperature, for connected\r\nwith the skin are sweat glands, and sebaceous glands, each having\r\nimportant excretory functions.\r\n\r\nThe skin is also a protective coat, very elastic, and varies greatly\r\nin thickness. It is thinnest in the eyelids and thickest over the back\r\nof the neck, back of the shoulders, palms of the hands and the soles of\r\nthe feet.\r\n\r\nThe color of the skin depends upon two things, first, on the pigment,\r\nwhich is found, one of the discriminating points between the races,\r\nnamed by the color of the skin as white, black, yellow, etc.; second,\r\nthe color depends upon the amount of blood in circulation, the deepest\r\nhue being in the parts exposed to the air, light and the varied\r\ntemperatures. Besides these the color of the skin varies with age,\r\npinkest in the infant and becoming yellow with old age. It varies with\r\nexposure and with climate, the people living in the north having a much\r\ndifferent complexion than those living in the south under the tropical\r\nsun. The color of the skin also varies with certain diseases, being\r\nextremely pale in anaemia, brown in Addison's disease, and yellow in\r\njaundice.\r\n\r\nThe skin can be said to be moveable, although in places it is attached\r\nfirmly to the underlying structures, especially on the scalp, the soles\r\nof the feet, and the palms of the hands.\r\n\r\nUpon close examination the skin discloses a multitude of openings,\r\ncreases, furrows, depressions, folds and hairs.\r\n\r\nA dimple is a permanent pit or depression due to the adhesion of the\r\nsurface to parts beneath.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The skin consists of two intimately connected structures,\r\nthe one is the _true skin_, _corium_, or _dermis_ and is the deepest\r\nlayer of the skin; and the other is the _false skin_, _cuticle_, or\r\n_epidermis_, and is the outermost layer of the skin.\r\n\r\n_The true skin_, is composed mostly of connective tissues and elastic\r\nfibers. It is the real seat of the sense of touch, for it is here that\r\nthe sensory nerves have their termination. In this layer we also have\r\nthe termination of the minute capillaries of the skin.\r\n\r\n_The false skin_, contains no blood vessels or nerves, and being\r\nwithout these it is practically dead tissue, and to illustrate this\r\nfact one can take a needle and run it through this outside layer\r\nwithout the least pain or the drawing of blood.\r\n\r\nThe false skin is the part which slips off in case of skin slip. In\r\nas much as the minute capillaries end at the termination of the true\r\nskin, when putrefaction and fermentation begin there is an oozing of\r\nwater from the capillaries and the surrounding tissues, between the two\r\nlayers of skin, causing a blister to form, and known as skin slip.\r\n\r\nAt the lowest part of the false skin is a layer of germinal cells, from\r\nwhich all the other cells are derived, and becoming more flattened and\r\nhorny as they are pushed farther away from the blood supply; and also\r\na layer of pigment cells, which give the discriminating color to the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nIn the skin are seen numerous sebaceous and sweat glands.\r\n\r\n_The sweat glands_ are the organs by which a large portion of the\r\naqueous and gaseous materials are excreted by the skin. Sweat glands\r\nare found in almost every portion of the skin, and are situated in\r\nsmall pits below the surface of the skin, surrounded by a quantity\r\nof adipose tissue or fat. They are small, round, reddish bodies,\r\nconsisting of a single tubule, convoluted in form, which extends up\r\nthrough the skin and opens on the surface. The size of these glands, of\r\ncourse, vary, being especially large in those regions where the flow of\r\nperspiration is copious as in the axilla.\r\n\r\n_The sebaceous glands_ are small, sacculated, glandular organs, lodged\r\nin the substance of the skin. They are found in most parts of the skin\r\nand are usually connected with the hair follicles. Each gland consists\r\nof a single duct, more or less capacious, which terminates in a cluster\r\nof small secreting pouches or saccules. These glands secrete an oily\r\nfluid, which keeps the skin soft and also oils the shaft of the hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Nails.=—The nails are a peculiar modification of the epidermis and\r\nhave the same cellular structure as that of the epidermis. The nails\r\nare found on the dorsal surface of the fingers and toes and act as a\r\nprotection, and enable one to pick up small objects, or to grasp more\r\nfirmly any object. Were it not for the nails it would be impossible for\r\none to pick up a needle from off the floor.\r\n\r\nEach nail is convex on its outer surface, and its chief mass which is\r\ncalled _the body_ lies upon the nail bed, or true skin; the free end\r\nprojects out over the surface of the finger, and is that part which is\r\nnot attached below, and since it is the continuation of the epidermis,\r\nit likewise will have no nerve or blood supply and therefore can be\r\ntrimmed without pain to the individual.\r\n\r\n_The root_ is implanted in a groove in the skin and is composed of\r\ncells which have not become horny. The root is white in color and is\r\nthe little half moon which you can see next to the skin.\r\n\r\n_The matrix_ is that part of the true skin beneath the body and the\r\nroot of the nail, and is so called, because, it is that part from which\r\nthe nail is produced and so long as the matrix at the root of the nail\r\nis uninjured, the nail will be reproduced after an accident.\r\n\r\nAfter death the nail turns black, due to the infiltration of blood into\r\nthe matrix.\r\n\r\n_Treatment by the Embalmer._—The blackened condition of the nail due to\r\nthe infiltration of blood into the matrix can in many cases be overcome\r\nby carefully rubbing the nail at the time the body is being injected.\r\nAfter the discoloration is removed the fingers should be kept elevated\r\nso that the blood will not settle there again.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Hair.=—The hair, like the nails, is a peculiar modification of the\r\nepidermis and consists of practically the same cellular structure as\r\nthe epidermis. Hair is found on nearly every part of the body excepting\r\nthe palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, the borders of the\r\nlips, etc. It varies much in length, thickness and in the different\r\nraces of mankind. In the eyelids it is short, on the scalp it is of\r\nconsiderable length. In other parts as the eye-lashes, the hair of the\r\npubis region, the whiskers and beard the thickness is remarkable.\r\n\r\nA hair consists of the root and the shaft. The root of the hair or\r\nthat part implanted in the skin presents at its extremity a bulbous\r\nenlargement, called the hair bulb. Into this bulb we find the small\r\narterial capillary circulating and at its termination the beginning\r\nof the venous capillary. In this way the hair is nourished in life.\r\nWe also find a small nerve going to the hair bulb. The shaft is the\r\nremaining part or that part coming out from the skin.\r\n\r\nThe hair grows from its roots and as it grows it pushes itself out\r\nfrom the skin and owes its growth to the small capillary circulation,\r\ncarrying pure arterial blood to each and every hair, and for this\r\nreason you can understand for yourself the erroneous idea of what is\r\ntermed the “post-mortem growth of hair.” Only a few weeks ago one of\r\nthe students declared that he had actually seen a subject shaved and\r\nthe body at the time of the funeral was placed in a vault to await the\r\narrival of a close relative who had to come from Europe.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later the student, together with the undertaker and\r\nrelatives, went to the vault to view the remains. The body was in a\r\nperfect state of preservation, only for a large growth of beard as\r\nthe student supposed. This student had observed rightly, but he did\r\nnot go far enough. He did not think of how the hair actually got its\r\nnourishment. The hair owes its life to the circulation of the blood,\r\njust as much as the heart or any other organ does, and will die and\r\ncease to grow just as soon as the body dies and the circulation is cut\r\noff. What this student saw was only an apparent growth, for after the\r\nbody dies the tissues begin to shrink, squeezing the blood and fluid\r\nsubstances out of them, thus giving the hair cylinder a more projected\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe student was very much surprised at his mistake, but after the\r\nexplanation he saw that the hair owed its life to the circulation and\r\nthat when this circulation was cut off, the hair must cease to grow.\r\n\r\nThe chief function of hair is that of protection from heat or cold and\r\nto help shield the brain from the effect of a blow upon the head.\r\n\r\nThe hair, next to the teeth and bones, is the least destructible part\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Fascia.=—The fascia (fascia, a bandage) is areolar or aponeurotic\r\ntissue of variable thickness and strength found in all regions of the\r\nbody and invests or surrounds the softer and more delicate organs.\r\nFrom its situation in the body the fascia is divided into two groups,\r\nsuperficial and deep.\r\n\r\n_Superficial fascia_ is found immediately beneath the skin over almost\r\nthe entire surface of the body. It connects the skin with the deep\r\nfascia and consists of areolar tissue.\r\n\r\nThe superficial fascia varies in thickness in different parts of the\r\nbody and some places, especially in the groin is capable of being\r\nsubdivided into several different layers. The first layer of the\r\nsuperficial fascia, which is just beneath the skin, usually contains\r\na great amount of fat or adipose tissue. This, in most text books, has\r\nbeen termed the subcutaneous tissue. The second layer is comparatively\r\ndevoid of adipose or fatty tissue and in this we find the trunks of the\r\nsubcutaneous vessels and nerves, as for example, the radial and ulnar\r\nveins in the arms and the saphenous vein in the leg.\r\n\r\nThe superficial fascia facilitates the movement of the skin, serves as\r\na soft medium for the passage of the vessels and nerves to the skin and\r\nretains the warmth of the body, since the fat contained in its meshes\r\nis a had conductor of heat.\r\n\r\n_Deep fascia_ or aponeurotic fascia is a dense inelastic, unyielding\r\nfibrous membrane, forming a sheath for the muscles and affording them\r\nbroad surfaces for attachment. On removal of the superficial fascia,\r\nthe deep fascia is usually exposed and can be seen as a dense, tough\r\nmembrane, which not only binds down the muscles to each region, but\r\ngives to each a separate sheath as well as to the blood vessels and\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nThus, on going down into the arm between the biceps and triceps muscles\r\nto raise the brachial artery, you would first cut through the skin,\r\nthen the subcutaneous tissue, the superficial fascia and then you would\r\ncome to a membrane investing the artery, vein and nerve. This membrane\r\nis the part of the deep fascia which covers the vessels, making a\r\ndistinct sheath for them and you must go through this sheath before you\r\ncan hope to raise the artery.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 3—Lymphatics of the head and neck. B, the\r\n   thoracic duct.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Lymphatics.=—The lymphatics occur in all parts of the body, and in\r\nmany respects resemble the veins, one of the most striking similarities\r\nbeing that the lymphatics contain valves just the same as the venous\r\nsystem. The lymphatic capillaries are arranged in the form of a net\r\nwork and resemble closely in structure the blood capillaries. These\r\ncapillaries then unite to form the lymph vessels and these then convey\r\nthe lymph to the subclavian veins. The lymph is a colorless fluid and\r\ncontains numerous blood corpuscles known as lymphocytes. But in those\r\nlymphatic vessels, which have their origin in the walls of the small\r\nintestines, the lymph, especially during digestion, contains a great\r\namount of fat, so that it has a milky appearance, and for this reason\r\nthe lymphatics of this region, have been termed lacteals. There are two\r\nmain lymphatic trunks, the one on the left side is called the thoracic\r\nduct. This duct extends from the lower border of the second lumbar\r\nvertebra, through the entire length of the thorax, and opens into the\r\nleft subclavian vein, close to the point where it is joined to the\r\nleft internal jugular. It receives the lymph from the lower limbs, the\r\npelvic walls and viscera, the abdominal walls and viscera; the lower\r\npart of the right half and the whole of the left half of the thoracic\r\nviscera, the left side of the neck and head and the left arm.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 4—Lymphatics of the leg.]\r\n\r\nThe other duct is called the right lymphatic duct and receives lymph\r\nfrom the upper part of the right side of the thoracic wall, part of\r\nthe right side of the diaphragm and the right lobe of the liver, the\r\nwhole of the right arm and neck and right side of the head. This trunk\r\nis very short and empties its supply of lymph into the right subclavian\r\nvein.\r\n\r\nReceptaculum chyli is the expanded portion of the thoracic duct just at\r\nits beginning. Its function is to receive the lacteals which come from\r\nthe villi of the intestines.\r\n\r\nLymph glands are the enlargements of the lymph vessels. They occur\r\nfrequently in the lymphatic system, being most numerous in the axillary\r\nspace, the cervical region (in the neck) and in Scarpa's triangle.\r\n\r\nThe lymphatic system aids greatly in warding off such diseases as blood\r\npoisoning, anthrax, etc.\r\n\r\n_The lacteals_ are the lymphatics which carry the chyme from the villi\r\nof the intestines and deposit it in the receptaculum chyli.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Glands.=—The glands of the human body are divided into three classes\r\ncalled tubular, alveolar and tubulo-alveolar glands.\r\n\r\n_Tubular Glands._—In these, the secreting portion consists of a long or\r\nshort tubule, which may be relatively straight or variously twisted,\r\none end of which ends blindly, while the other end opens on the free\r\nsurface or into a duct.\r\n\r\nTubular glands may be simple, or having only a single tubule; they\r\nmay be simple branched, having more than one tubule; or they may be\r\ncompound branched, thus resembling the branching of a tree.\r\n\r\nSome tubular glands would be the liver, kidneys, testes, lachrymal\r\nglands, serous glands of the mucous membranes, fundus glands of the\r\nstomach, uterine glands, the majority of the pyloric glands and the\r\nmajority of the sweat glands.\r\n\r\n_Alveolar Glands._—In these, the secreting compartments have the form\r\nof variously shaped vesicles or saccules, known as alveoli which open\r\non the free surface or into a duct.\r\n\r\nAlveolar glands may be either simple, simple branched, or compound\r\nbranched.\r\n\r\nSome alveolar glands would be the sebaceous glands, pancreas, mammary\r\ngland, ovary and thyroid.\r\n\r\n_Tubulo-alveolar Glands._—In these, there is a combination of the\r\ntubular and the alveolar type. They may also be simple, simple branched\r\nor compound branched.\r\n\r\nSome of this type would be certain of the pyloric glands, certain of\r\nthe sweat glands, some mucous glands, the prostate and the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe most important glands will be discussed under the tissue or the\r\norgan in which they are situated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cartilage.=—Cartilage is a transition stage between connective tissue\r\nand bone; when it is boiled it yields condrin. It is found in various\r\nparts of the body, in the adults being found chiefly in the joints,\r\nin the sides of the thorax, and in various tubes which are not kept\r\npermanently open, such as the air passages, nostrils, ears, etc. In the\r\nfoetus, the greater part of the framework is cartilaginous and as the\r\nfoetus matures this cartilage is finally replaced by bone. Cartilage is\r\ndivided into hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibro cartilage.\r\n\r\n_Hyaline cartilage_ is found in the nose, larynx, trachea, and bronchi.\r\n\r\n_Elastic cartilage_ is found in the epiglottis and the cartilages of\r\nthe larynx.\r\n\r\n_Fibro cartilage_ is found at the point of insertion of the ligaments,\r\ninto the body of the bone, such as the cartilage which helps to hold\r\nthe femur or long bone of the thigh into the hip.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bones.=—Bone results from the calcification of cartilage or fibrous\r\ntissue. It is a highly specialized form of connective tissue. There are\r\ntwo varieties of bone; dense or compact bone and cancellous, loose, or\r\nspongy bone. Compact bone is dense, like ivory, and is always found on\r\nthe exterior of bones.\r\n\r\nCancellous bone is found in the interior of bones, and has a\r\nlattice-work appearance.\r\n\r\nBone consists of one-third animal or organic matter and two-thirds\r\nearthy or inorganic matter. These proportions, however, vary with age.\r\nIn youth it is nearly half and half, while in the adult the earthy\r\nis greatly in excess. It also varies with disease. With some defect\r\nof nutrition, the bone is deprived of its normal proportion of earthy\r\nmatter, while the animal matter is of unhealthy quality, and we have\r\nas a result, a disease called rickets, so common in the children of the\r\npoor. The earthy or inorganic matter consists of phosphate, carbonate,\r\nfluoride of calcium, sodium chloride, and phosphate of magnesium. The\r\nanimal matter consists of fat collagen, which when boiled with water is\r\nresolved into gelatin.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the two substances, take a bone and place it in dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid. The acid will eat out all the mineral matter and we\r\nhave left only the animal matter. After this operation one can take the\r\nbone and can bend it into any position whatever, which experiment shows\r\nthat the animal matter gives elasticity to the bone.\r\n\r\nThe second experiment would be to put the bone on a bed of hot coals\r\nand burn it. Only the animal matter will burn and we will have the\r\nmineral matter remaining. After this operation one will find that the\r\nbone is very brittle and will easily break, which experiment shows that\r\nthe mineral matter gives stability and support to the bone.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 5—Cross section of bone. (Sharpey)]\r\n\r\nIf a cross section is made of any long bone, such as the humerus,\r\nand this section placed under the low power of the microscope, the\r\nHaversian canal system can be discerned. The Haversian canal system\r\nconsists of the numerous small openings or canals through which the\r\nblood vessels ramify in distributing the nourishment to the bone.\r\nAround each individual canal are seen smaller spaces arranged in a\r\ncircle. These are known as the lacunae (small lakes). Going from the\r\nlacunae are smaller canals which take on the name canaliculae, and\r\njoining all the lacunae together, making the appearance of concentric\r\ncircles, we have the lamellae. The outside covering of the bone is\r\ncalled the periosteum and the inside covering is called the endosteum.\r\nMost of the long bones and many of the smaller bones are supplied by\r\na nutrient artery, which enters the bone near its center, enters the\r\nbone marrow, and divides into two branches, one going up and the other\r\ndown in the marrow. The blood is then distributed through the Haversian\r\ncanal system. Veins emerge from the long bones in three places: 1. One\r\nor two large veins accompany the nutrient artery. 2. Numerous veins\r\nemerge from the articular extremities. 3. Many small veins arise in and\r\nemerge from the compact substance.\r\n\r\nBones are divided, according to shape, into four classes: long, short,\r\nflat and irregular.\r\n\r\n_Long Bones._—These bones are usually used as a system of levers to\r\nconfer the power of locomotion. A long bone consists of a shaft and\r\ntwo extremities. The shaft is a hollow cylinder within which is the\r\nmedullary canal. The extremities are somewhat expanded for the purpose\r\nof articulation, and to afford a broad surface for the attachment of\r\nmuscles. The long bones are as a rule curved in two directions to give\r\ngreater strength to the bone. Some examples of this class of bone are\r\nthe clavicle, radius, ulna, humerus, femur, tibia, fibula, metacarpal,\r\nmetatarsal, and the phalanges.\r\n\r\n_Short Bones._—These bones are placed in that part of the skeleton\r\nwhere there is need for strength and compactness, and where the motion\r\nof the part is slight and limited. Some examples of this class of bone\r\nare the bones of the carpus and tarsus (in the hand and the foot).\r\n\r\n_Flat Bones._—Flat bones are found where the principle requirement\r\nis either extensive protection, or the need of a broad surface for\r\nthe attachment of muscles. Some of the bones of this class are the\r\noccipital, parietal, frontal, nasal, lachrymal, vomer, scapula,\r\nsternum, and the ribs.\r\n\r\n_Irregular Bones._—These bones are such as from their peculiar shape\r\nand form can not be grouped under any of the preceding heads. Some of\r\nthe bones of this class are the vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, temporal,\r\nsphenoid, ethmoid, etc.\r\n\r\nIf the surface of a bone is examined, certain articular and\r\nnon-articular eminences and depressions will be seen.\r\n\r\n_Articular Eminences._—Examples of this class are found in the heads of\r\nthe humerus and the femur.\r\n\r\n_Articular Depressions._—Examples of this class are found in the\r\nglenoid cavity of the scapula and the acetabulum.\r\n\r\n_Non-articular Eminences._—These are designated according to their form.\r\n\r\nA tuberosity is a broad, rough, and uneven elevation.\r\n\r\nA tubercle is a small, rough prominence.\r\n\r\nA spine is a sharp, slender, pointed eminence.\r\n\r\nA ridge, line, or crest is a narrow, rough elevation, running some way\r\nalong the surface.\r\n\r\n_Non-articular Depressions._—These are of variable form, and are\r\ndescribed as notches, sulci, fossae, grooves, furrows, fissures, etc.\r\nThese non-articular eminences and depressions may serve to increase\r\nthe extent of surface for the attachment of ligaments and muscles or\r\nmay receive blood vessels, nerves, tendons, ligaments, or portions of\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nCanals or foramina are channels or openings in bone through which pass\r\nthe nerves and blood vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Teeth.=—In the human body we find two sets of teeth. One appearing in\r\nchildhood, and are known as milk teeth, twenty in number, the permanent\r\nteeth replacing these about the sixth year.\r\n\r\nThere are thirty-two permanent teeth, divided into four incisors, two\r\ncanines, four bicuspids and six molars.\r\n\r\nTeeth are made up of three different substances, which are known as\r\nenamel, dentine and cement.\r\n\r\nThe enamel is a very hard substance, the hardest in the body, and may\r\nbe compared to quartz. The enamel covers the entire tooth down as far\r\nas the gums.\r\n\r\nThe cement is a continuation of the enamel below the gums, and is\r\nclosely adherent to the dentine. The cement consists of bone tissue,\r\nbut the lamellae as a rule do not contain Haversian canals.\r\n\r\nThe dentine is, next to the enamel, the hardest tissue of the tooth,\r\nand composes the main body of the tooth. The pulp cavity is found\r\nwithin the center of the tooth, with the opening toward the jaw bone.\r\nThe tooth is nourished by a nutrient artery and vein and nerve which\r\npass into the pulp of the tooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nerves.=—Nerves are divided into two general classes, called medullary\r\nand non-medullary nerves. The non-medullated type arise mostly from\r\nthe sympathetic system, while the medullated type arise from the brain\r\nand cord. As a rule, the nerves of the body follow the course of the\r\narteries, and are generally found in the same sheath with the artery\r\nand vein.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 6—Section of a nerve fibre. (Klein and\r\n   Noble Smith)]\r\n\r\nThey are easily distinguished from the arteries and veins by touch and\r\nby their color, being very inelastic and fibrous, hard to the touch,\r\nand unlike the artery or vein, since they have no central opening.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Muscles.=—Myology is that branch of anatomy which treats of the\r\nmuscles. The muscles are formed of bundles of reddish fibres, endowed\r\nwith the property of contractility. In the body we find two kinds of\r\nmuscular tissue, called voluntary and involuntary muscle. The voluntary\r\ntype is characterized by the striped appearance which it displays when\r\nseen under the microscope, and for this reason it is called striped\r\nor striated muscle. It is so named “voluntary” because it is capable\r\nof being put into action and controlled by the will. The involuntary\r\nmuscles do not present any striped appearance, and consequently are\r\ncalled unstriped or non-striated, and are not under the control of the\r\nwill. An example of voluntary muscle would be any muscle of the bony\r\nframework as for example, the biceps or triceps.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 7—View of muscle fibers.]\r\n\r\nAn example of involuntary muscle would be those of the intestines and\r\nstomach, the muscles of the bladder and uterus and the walls of the\r\narteries and veins, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed under the microscope, the muscle is seen to be composed of\r\nmany fibrils. The sheath covering each fibril is called the sarcolemma,\r\nand contains within its boundaries the muscle plasma, or protoplasm,\r\nand a nucleus. Many of the fibrils when grouped together constitute the\r\nentire muscle.\r\n\r\nThe muscles get their blood supply from the nutrient artery, which\r\nramifies the tissues, the smallest capillaries coming in contact with\r\neach muscle cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tendons.=—Tendons are white, glistening, fibrous cords, varying\r\nin length and thickness, sometimes round, sometimes flattened,\r\nof considerable strength, and devoid of elasticity. It consists\r\nprincipally of a substance which yields gelatin.\r\n\r\nTendons do not have a direct blood supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aponeuroses.=—Aponeuroses are flattened or ribbon-like tendons, of a\r\npearly-white color, irridescent, glistening, and similar in structure\r\nto the tendons.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ligaments.=—Ligaments consist of bands of various forms, serving to\r\nconnect the articular extremities of bones. They are strong bands of\r\nsmooth, silverwhite fibrous tissue.\r\n\r\nA ligament is pliable and flexible, so as to allow the most perfect\r\nfreedom of movement, but at the same time it is tough and strong, so\r\nas not to yield readily under the severe applied force, and for this\r\nreason they serve as good connecting links for the binding of bones\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n_Poupart's Ligament._—Poupart's ligament extends from the crest of\r\nthe ilium to the top of the pubic bone. This ligament is of utmost\r\nimportance to the embalmer, as it serves as a guide to locate the\r\nfemoral artery. By placing the thumb on the crest of the ilium and\r\nthe second finger on the top of the public bone, then letting the\r\nfirst finger drop midway between the two, which would be the center of\r\nPoupart's ligament, we have a point which marks the exit of the artery\r\nfrom the body and the beginning of the femoral artery.\r\n\r\nPoupart's ligament also forms the base of Scarpa's triangle. The\r\nstructure of this triangle will be taken up later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fat.=—Fat is a deposit of an oil in the cells of the tissues, just\r\nbeneath the skin, giving roundness and plumpness to the body, and\r\nacting as an excellent non-conductor for the retention of heat.\r\n\r\nSo tiny are these cells, that there are over sixty-five million in a\r\ncubic inch of fat. As they are kept moist, the liquid does not ooze\r\nout; but, on drying, it comes to the surface, and thus a piece of fat\r\nfeels oily when exposed to the air. The quantity of fat varies with\r\nthe state of nutrition. In corpulent persons, the masses of fat beneath\r\nthe skin, in the mesentery, on the surface of the heart and the great\r\nvessels, between the muscles, and in the neighborhood of the nerves,\r\nare considerably increased. Conversely, in the emaciated we sometimes\r\nfind beneath the skin cells which contain only one oil drop. Many\r\nmasses of fat which have an important relation to muscular actions—such\r\nas the fat of the orbit or the cheek, do not disappear in the most\r\nemaciated persons. Even in starvation, the fatty substance of the brain\r\nand spinal cord are retained.\r\n\r\nFat collects as pads in the hollows of the bones, around the joints and\r\nbetween the muscles, causing them to glide more easily upon each other.\r\nAs marrow, it nourishes the skeleton, and also distributes the shock of\r\nany jar the limb may sustain.\r\n\r\nFat does not gather within the cranium, the lungs or the eyelids, where\r\nits accumulation would clog the organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mucous Membranes.=—Mucous membranes line all the open cavities of the\r\nbody, or all those cavities which communicate with the outside.\r\n\r\nAt the edges of the openings into the body, the skin seems to stop and\r\ngive place to a tissue which is redder, more sensitive, more liable to\r\nbleed, and is moistened by a fluid or mucous, as it is called. Really,\r\nhowever, the skin does not cease, but passes into a more delicate\r\ncovering of the same general structure, and it is to this that the name\r\nmucous membrane is applied.\r\n\r\nThe entire alimentary canal, the entire respiratory tract, and the\r\ngenito-urinary tract, are lined with a mucous membrane. Mucous membrane\r\nsecretes a mucous fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Serous Membranes.=—Serous membranes line the closed cavities of the\r\nbody. The pleurae, the pericardium and the peritoneum are examples of\r\nserous membranes. Serous membranes secrete a serous fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Synovial Membranes.=—Synovial membranes are serous in character, and\r\nconsist of loose connective tissue, containing fat, vessels and nerves,\r\nits inner surface being usually lined with secreting cells. The fluid\r\nsecreted is yellowish-white or slightly reddish, resembling very much\r\nthe white of an egg. It contains fats, salts, albumen, extractives from\r\nthe lymph, and a fluid known as synovia. The chief function of this\r\nfluid is to act as an oil to lubricate the joints and surfaces in which\r\nthere is any friction.\r\n\r\nSynovial membranes are divided into three classes, known as articular,\r\nbursal and vaginal.\r\n\r\n_Articular synovial membranes_ are found in every free movable joint.\r\n\r\n_Bursal synovial membranes_ are sacs interposed between the surfaces\r\nwhich move upon each other, producing friction, as in the gliding of a\r\ntendon or of the integument over projecting bony surfaces.\r\n\r\n_Vaginal synovial membranes_ serve to facilitate the gliding of a\r\ntendon in the bony canal through which it passes.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 8—Section of artery. (Grunstein)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Arteries.=—The arteries are cylindrical vessels which serve to convey\r\nthe blood from both ventricles of the heart to every part of the body.\r\nThey are called arteries from the Greek words which mean “to contain\r\nair,” and they were supposed, by our ancients, to have this function\r\nuntil the time of Galen, when he refuted this opinion and showed that\r\nthese vessels, though for the most part empty after death, actually\r\ncontained blood. The distribution of the arteries may be compared\r\nto a tree, the common trunk of which corresponds to the aorta, and\r\nthe smallest twigs corresponding to the minute capillaries. When one\r\nartery communicates with another it is said to anastomose, and this\r\ncommunication is very free between the larger as between the smaller\r\nbranches. Anastomosis between trunks of equal size is found where great\r\nactivity of the circulation is requisite, as at the base of the brain,\r\nwhere the two vertebrals unite to form the basilar artery.\r\n\r\nIn the limbs and arms the anastomoses are more numerous and of larger\r\nsize around the joints. The branches of the artery above, unite\r\nwith branches, from the vessels below. These anastomoses are called\r\ncollateral circulations. The principal ones of interest to the embalmer\r\nare those of the deep brachial uniting with the recurrent radial and\r\nulnar arteries, forming the collateral circulation in the arm; the deep\r\nfemoral uniting with the recurrent posterior and anterior tibials,\r\nforming the collateral circulation in the leg; the superficial and\r\ndeep mammary arteries, branches of the subclavian artery uniting with\r\nthe superficial and deep epigastric arteries, branches of the external\r\niliac, forming the collateral circulation over the abdomen and chest,\r\nand may be considered the longest collateral circulation in the body.\r\n\r\nA terminal artery is one which forms no anastomoses; such vessels are\r\nfound in the heart, brain, spleen, kidneys, lungs and mesentery.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—An artery consists of an internal, a middle and an\r\nexternal coat.\r\n\r\nThe inner coat consists of endothelial cells and elastic fibrous\r\ntissue, sometimes arranged longitudinally, but usually they form a\r\ndistinct fenestrated membrane (similar to a doorscreen).\r\n\r\nThe middle coat consists mostly of elastic tissue and white fibrous\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\nThe external coat is called the fibrous coat. It contains fibrous\r\nconnective tissue and elastic tissues.\r\n\r\n_Vasa-Vasorum._—Running in the outer wall of the artery, we find small\r\ncapillary vessels, and their function is that of nourishing the outer\r\nwall, for the blood which passes through the artery does not nourish\r\nthe artery from within, but depends on these small capillaries, called\r\nvasa-vasorum, for their nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe individual sheath, or arterial sheath, the covering for the artery,\r\nis composed of connective tissue, and at places may adhere very tightly\r\nto the artery.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 9—Valves of the veins.\r\n\r\n   FIG. 10—Cross section through a small artery and vein. (Klein\r\n   and Noble Smith)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Veins.=—The veins are the vessels which carry the blood from the\r\ncapillaries back to the right auricle of the heart, and are found in\r\nnearly every tissue of the body. They commence as venous capillaries,\r\nuniting together into larger and larger veins, until we have the great\r\nascending and descending venae cavae. In form the veins are perfectly\r\ncylindrical, like the arteries, but with this difference, that their\r\nwalls collapse when empty and that they contain valves.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The vein has about the same structure as the artery, only\r\nthat the middle coat is much thinner and less elastic than the artery,\r\nand for this reason it easily collapses.\r\n\r\nVeins are divided into superficial, deep and sinuses. Superficial veins\r\nare found between the layers of the superficial fascia, just underneath\r\nthe skin.\r\n\r\nDeep veins accompany the arteries, and are usually enclosed in the same\r\ncommon sheath with the artery.\r\n\r\nSinuses are venous channels, which in their structure and mode of\r\ndistribution differ altogether from the veins. They are found only\r\nin the interior of the skull, and consist of channels formed by a\r\nseparation of the two layers of the dura mater.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 11—Human blood.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blood.=—The blood of the body is contained in a practically closed\r\nsystem of tubes, the blood vessels, within which it is kept circulating\r\nby force of the heart beat. It is usually spoken of as the nutritive\r\nliquid of the body, but the functions may be stated explicitly,\r\nalthough still in quite general terms, by saying that it carries to\r\nthe tissues food stuffs after they have been properly prepared by the\r\ndigestive organs; that it transports to the tissues oxygen, absorbed\r\nfrom the air by the lungs; that it carries from the tissues various\r\nwaste products formed in the processes of dissimilation; that it is\r\nthe medium for the transmission of the internal secretion of certain\r\nglands; that it aids in equalizing the temperature and water contents\r\nof the body.\r\n\r\nThe total quantity of blood in the body has been determined\r\napproximately for man as one-thirteenth of the body weight. The\r\nspecific gravity of human blood in the adult may vary from 1.041 to\r\n1.067, the average being about 1.055.\r\n\r\nThe blood is composed of a liquid part, the plasma, in which float\r\na vast number of microscopical bodies, the blood corpuscles, known\r\nrespectively as the red corpuscles, the white corpuscles or leucocytes,\r\nof which in turn there are a great many different kinds, and the blood\r\nplates.\r\n\r\n_Blood plasma_, when obtained free from corpuscles, is perfectly\r\ncolorless, in thin layers, for example, in microscopical preparation;\r\nwhen seen in large quantities it shows a slightly yellowish tint.\r\nThe red color of the blood is not due, therefore, to coloration of\r\nthe blood plasma, but is caused by the mass of red corpuscles held\r\nin suspension in the liquid. The proportion by bulk of plasma to\r\ncorpuscles is usually given roughly as two to one. The blood plasma\r\nis composed of two substances, blood serum and blood fibrin. You\r\nhave noticed that blood, after it has escaped from the vessels,\r\nusually clots or coagulates. The clot, as it forms, gradually\r\nshrinks and squeezes out a clear liquid, to which the name blood\r\nserum has been given. Serum resembles the plasma of normal blood in\r\ngeneral appearance, but differs from it in composition. Here it is\r\nsufficient to say that blood serum is the liquid part of the blood\r\nafter coagulation has taken place. You can prepare this experiment\r\nfor yourself: If shed blood is whipped vigorously with a rod or\r\nsome similar object while it is clotting, the essential part of the\r\nclot, namely the fibrin, forms differently from what it does when\r\nthe blood is allowed to coagulate quietly. It is deposited in shreds\r\non the whipper. Blood that has been treated in this way is known as\r\ndefibrinated blood. It consists of blood serum plus the red and white\r\ncorpuscles, and as far as appearances go it resembles exactly the\r\nnormal blood; it has lost, however, its power of clotting.\r\n\r\n_Red blood corpuscles_ are bi-concave, circular disks, without nuclei;\r\ntheir average diameter is 7.7 microns (1 micron equals 1-25,000 of an\r\ninch); their number, which is usually reckoned as so many to a cu.\r\nmillimeter, varies greatly under different conditions of health and\r\ndisease. The average number is given as 5,600,000 per cubic millimeter\r\nfor males and 4,500,000 per cubic millimeter for females.\r\n\r\nThe number of red corpuscles also varies in individuals with the\r\nconstitution, nutrition and manner of life. It varies with age,\r\nbeing greatest in the fetus and in the new-born child. It varies\r\nwith the time of the day, showing a distinct diminution after meals.\r\nIn the female it varies somewhat with menstruation and pregnancy,\r\nbeing slightly increased in the former and diminished in the latter\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe red color of the corpuscles is due to the presence in them of\r\na pigment, known as hemoglobin. Owing to the minute size of the\r\ncorpuscles, their color when seen singly under the microscope is a\r\nfaint yellowish red, but when seen in mass they exhibit the well-known\r\nblood-red color, which varies from a scarlet in arterial blood to a\r\npurplish red in venous blood, this variation in color being dependent\r\nupon the amount of oxygen contained in the blood in combination with\r\nthe hemoglobin. The function of the red blood corpuscles is to carry\r\noxygen from the lungs to the tissues. This function is entirely\r\ndependent upon the presence of hemoglobins, which have the power of\r\ncombining easily with the oxygen gas.\r\n\r\n_White blood corpuscles or leucocytes_ contain no hemoglobin or\r\ncoloring matter. They have a nucleus or center spot. Their size varies\r\nfrom 5 to 12 microns, and are less numerous than the red corpuscles,\r\nbeing in this proportion: one white corpuscle to 500 red corpuscles.\r\nThe chief functions of the white corpuscles are: (1) That they\r\nprotect the body from pathogenic or disease-producing bacteria. In\r\nexplanation of this action it has been suggested that they may either\r\ningest the bacteria and thus destroy them directly, or they may form\r\ncertain substances, defensive proteids, that destroy the bacteria.\r\nWhite corpuscles that act by ingesting the bacteria are spoken of as\r\nphagocytes (meaning to eat the cell). (2) They aid in the absorption of\r\nfats from the intestines. (3) They aid in the absorption of peptones\r\nfrom the intestines. (4) They take part in the process of blood\r\ncoagulation. (5) They help in maintaining the normal composition of the\r\nblood plasma in proteids.\r\n\r\n_Blood plates_ are small circular or elliptical bodies, nearly\r\nhomogeneous in structure, variable in size, always much smaller than\r\nthe red blood corpuscles. Less is known of their origin, fate and\r\nfunctions than in the case of the other blood corpuscles, but there is\r\nsome considerable evidence to show that they take part in the process\r\nof coagulation or clotting.\r\n\r\n_Coagulation of the Blood._—One of the most striking properties of\r\nthe blood is its power of clotting, or coagulating, shortly after it\r\nleaves the blood-vessels, or if any foreign elements come in contact\r\nwith it. The general changes in the blood during this process are\r\neasily followed. At first perfectly fluid, in a few minutes it becomes\r\nviscous, and then sets into a soft jelly, which quickly becomes firmer,\r\nso that the vessel containing it can be inverted without spilling the\r\nblood. The clot continues to grow more impact, and gradually shrinks\r\nin volume, pressing out a greater or smaller amount of clear, faintly\r\nyellow liquid, to which the name blood serum is given. The essential\r\npart of the clot is the fibrin.\r\n\r\nFibrin is an insoluble proteid not found in normal blood. In shed\r\nblood, and under certain conditions while still in the blood-vessels,\r\nthis fibrin is formed. In forming, it shows an exceedingly fine network\r\nof delicate threads that permeate the whole mass of the blood and gives\r\nthe clot its jelly-like character. The shrinking of the threads causes\r\nthe subsequent contraction of the clot. If the blood has not been\r\ndisturbed during the act of clotting, the red corpuscles are caught in\r\nthe fine fibrin mesh-work, and as the clot shrinks these corpuscles are\r\nheld more firmly, only the clear liquid of the blood being squeezed\r\nout, so it is possible to get specimens of serum containing few or\r\nno red blood corpuscles. The white corpuscles or leucocytes, on the\r\ncontrary, although they are also caught at first in the forming meshes\r\nof fibrin, in latter stages of the clotting they readily pass out\r\ninto the serum, on account of their power of having movement. If the\r\nblood has been agitated during the process of clotting, the delicate\r\nnet work will be broken in places, and the serum will be more or\r\nless bloody—that is, it will contain numerous red blood corpuscles.\r\nIf during the time of clotting the blood is vigorously whipped with\r\na bundle of fine rods, all the fibrin is deposited as a stringy mass\r\non the whipper, and the remaining liquid part consists of serum plus\r\nred corpuscles. Blood that has been whipped in this way is known as\r\ndefibrinated blood. It resembles normal blood in appearance, but is\r\ndifferent in composition; it can not clot again. The way in which\r\nfibrin is normally deposited can be easily demonstrated by taking\r\na drop of blood on a slide and covering it with a cover slip, allow\r\nit to stand several minutes until coagulation is complete, and view\r\nunder a microscope. If the drop is examined, it is possible by careful\r\nfocusing, to discover in the spaces between the masses of corpuscles\r\nmany examples of delicate fibrin net work. The physiological value of\r\nthe clotting of blood in life is that it stops hemorrhages by closing\r\nthe openings of the wounded blood vessels, but the clotting of the\r\nblood after death, is to the embalmer one of the bugbears, and a real\r\nmethod of preventing it, or of dissolving the clot after it has once\r\nformed in the blood vessels is one of those difficult problems which\r\nremains as yet unsolved.\r\n\r\nSince we have no real method of preventing coagulation in the blood\r\nvessels, let us search out the things which will hasten or retard\r\nthis coagulation. Blood coagulates normally within a few minutes\r\nafter it is liberated from the blood vessel, but this process may be\r\nhastened by increasing the amount of foreign substance with which it\r\ncomes in contact. Thus the agitation of the liquid in quantity or the\r\napplication of a sponge or handkerchief or the application of heat\r\nhastens the onset of clotting.\r\n\r\nCoagulation in drawn blood may be retarded or prevented altogether by\r\na variety of means, of which the following are the most important:\r\n\r\n(1) By cooling.\r\n\r\n(2) By the action of neutral salts.\r\n\r\n(3) By the action of oxalate solutions.\r\n\r\n(4) By the action of sodium fluoride.\r\n\r\nSummary.—To summarize then, the following statements may be made:\r\n\r\n(1) The immediate factor necessary to the clotting of the blood is the\r\nfibrin.\r\n\r\n(2) That blood does not clot normally in the blood vessels before death.\r\n\r\n(3) That after death blood remains for a long time without clotting,\r\nprovided some outside agent is not introduced to cause it.\r\n\r\nSuch an agent may be the blood coming in contact with the air, or\r\nthe blood drainage tube. The one point then to be emphasized is that\r\nwhen a vein is cut, and the blood begins to flow, you know that the\r\nblood is not in a coagulated condition. Then work rapidly, put the\r\nblood drainage tube quickly into the vein and draw off as much blood\r\nas you can before it begins to clot at the end of the tube. The great\r\ntrouble has been, that the embalmer does not work with precision. He\r\nfirst raises the vein, and exposes it on the surface of the incision.\r\nHe then raises the artery. He places the drainage tube into the vein,\r\nbut shuts it off till he is ready with the artery. Now, by the time he\r\nhas placed the arterial tube in the artery, injected a few bulbs full\r\nto see that all is in working order, and has perhaps attended to a few\r\nother duties, he is amazed to find that the blood will not flow, that\r\nit has clotted. What is the reason? He gave it time to clot after the\r\ndrainage tube was inserted.\r\n\r\nA better procedure would be not to touch the vein until every other\r\nprocedure has been attended to. Then raise the vein, insert the\r\ndrainage tube and withdraw the blood quickly, and at the same time\r\nkeep injecting slowly into the arterial system to keep up the needed\r\npressure to keep the blood flowing.\r\n\r\n(4) That when a clot is once formed in a blood vessel, it is not\r\ndissolved by the addition of fluid or any other solution.\r\n\r\n(5) That sometimes when the blood has become clotted at the end of\r\nthe drainage tube, it can be loosened up or be slightly pushed away by\r\nattaching the pump to the drainage tube and injecting a few bulbs of\r\nfluid, which, when it runs out, will again start the flow of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOSTEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—Osteology is the science of the structure and functions\r\nof bones.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the treatment of this subject, it is not our aim to take\r\nup all the minute details concerning each bone, all we desire is to\r\nexplain the form, uses and location of some of the principle bones\r\nand sets of bones of the body in so far as they may come to be used as\r\nlandmarks for the embalmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Skeleton.=—The entire skeleton in the adult consists of 200\r\ndistinct bones.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 12—The Skeleton.]\r\n\r\n  Spine—\r\n        Cervical          7\r\n        Dorsal           12\r\n        Lumbar            5\r\n        Coccygeal         1\r\n        Sacral            1\r\n                         ——\r\n                         26      26\r\n  Cranium                         8\r\n  Face                           14\r\n  Hyoid                           1\r\n  Sternum                         1\r\n  Ribs—\r\n        True            7 Pair\r\n        False           3  “\r\n        Floating        2  “\r\n                       ———————\r\n                       12  “     24\r\n  Upper Extremities              64\r\n  Lower Extremities              62\r\n                                ———\r\n                                200\r\n\r\nIn the above outline the bones of the ear and the sesamoid bones are\r\nnot considered. Different anatomists make different computations as to\r\nthe number of bones in the skeleton. Some authorities add the bones of\r\nthe ear, thus making 206 in all. If all the little sesamoid bones were\r\nadded, the number could be greatly augmented.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Vertebral or Spinal Column. (The Spine).=—The spine is a flexuous\r\nand flexible column formed of a series of bones called vertebrae. There\r\nare twenty-six in number and may be divided as follows:\r\n\r\n  Cervical        7 bones\r\n  Dorsal         12   “\r\n  Lumbar          5   “\r\n  Sacral          1   “\r\n  Coccygeal       1   “\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 13—The Spine.]\r\n\r\nThe cervical vertebrae are smaller than those in any other region of\r\nthe spine, and may be readily distinguished as they lie in the neck and\r\nextend from the base of the skull to the dorsal vertebrae, or the point\r\nof attachment of the first rib to the first dorsal.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal or thoracic vertebrae are the next in rotation down the\r\nspine and are intermediate in size between those in the cervical and\r\nthose in the lumbar region, and increase in size from above downward.\r\n\r\nThe lumbar vertebrae, the next in rotation, are the largest of the\r\nvertebral column and can be distinguished as those lying in the lumbar\r\nregion or the small of the back.\r\n\r\nThe sacrum, meaning sacred, so called, because it was the part selected\r\nin sacrifices. The sacrum is a large triangular bone, situated at the\r\nlower part of the vertebral column, and at the upper and back part of\r\nthe pelvic cavity.\r\n\r\nThe coccyx, so called from having been compared to a cuckoo's beak.\r\nIt is usually formed of four small segments of bones, and gradually\r\ndiminish in size from above downward, and blend together so as to form\r\na single bone.\r\n\r\nThe spinal column is situated in the median line, at the posterior\r\npart of the trunk. Its average length is about two feet, two or three\r\ninches. The female spine is about one inch shorter than the male.\r\n\r\nThe spinal canal in which runs the spinal cord, follows the different\r\ncurves of the spine; the opening being the largest in those regions\r\nin which the spine enjoys the greatest freedom of movement, and the\r\nsmallest where motion is more limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Skull.=—The skull is the bony framework of the head. The cranium\r\nis the name applied when we do not consider the mandible (the lower\r\njaw).\r\n\r\nThe skull is oval in shape, wider behind than in front, and is\r\nsupported on the summit of the vertebral column.\r\n\r\nThe skull is composed of twenty-two bones and is divided as the\r\nfollowing diagram will show:\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 14—The Skull.]\r\n\r\n                           { Occipital\r\n                           { Two parietal\r\n                           { Frontal\r\n          { Cranium        { Two temporal\r\n          {                { Sphenoid\r\n          {                { Ethmoid\r\n  Skull   {\r\n          {                { Two inferior turbinate\r\n          {                { Two nasal\r\n          {                { Two superior maxillary\r\n          { Face           { Two lachrymal\r\n                           { Two malar\r\n                           { Two palate\r\n                           { Inferior maxillary\r\n                           { Vomer\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Bones of the Cranium.=—_Occipital Bone._—The occipital bone is\r\nsituated at the back part and base of the cranium.\r\n\r\n_Frontal Bone._—The frontal bone is situated at the anterior part of\r\nthe cranium, and forms the forehead.\r\n\r\n_Parietal Bones._—The parietal bones, two in number, form, by their\r\nunion, the sides and roof of the cranium. They are between the frontal\r\nand the occipital bones.\r\n\r\n_Temporal Bones._—The temporal bones, two in number, are situated at\r\nthe sides and base of the skull.\r\n\r\n_Sphenoid Bone._—The sphenoid bone is situated at the anterior part of\r\nthe base of the skull articulating with all the other cranial bones.\r\n\r\n_Ethmoid Bone._—The ethmoid is an exceedingly light, spongy bone, which\r\nis situated at the anterior part of the base of the cranium.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Bones of the Face.=—_Nasal Bone._—The nasal bones, two in number,\r\nare placed side by side at the middle and upper part of the face,\r\nforming, by their junction, “the bridge” of the nose.\r\n\r\n_Superior Maxillary Bones._—The superior maxillae, two in number, are\r\nthe largest bones of the face, excepting the lower jaw, and form by\r\ntheir junction, the upper jaw.\r\n\r\n_Inferior Maxillary Bone._—The inferior maxillary bone is also called\r\nthe mandible. This bone is the largest and strongest bone of the face.\r\nIn a great many cases after death this bone drops down, and it becomes\r\none of the first duties of the embalmer, to place this bone in the\r\nproper position, so that it will set with the gradual death stiffening.\r\nIf the lower jaw has already set, in proper position, it is best not to\r\nbreak up the rigor, because, once broken up, it will be hard to set it\r\nin proper condition again without the use of stitches.\r\n\r\nThe upper and lower jaws are the fundamental bones for mastication.\r\n\r\n_Lachrymal Bones._—The lachrymal bones, two in number, are the smallest\r\nand most fragile bones of the face. They are situated at the front part\r\nof the inner wall of the orbit of the eye.\r\n\r\n_Malar Bones._—These are the cheek bones. There are two in number,\r\nsituated at the upper and outer part of the face.\r\n\r\n_Palate Bones._—The palate bones, two in number are situated at the\r\nback part of the nasal fossae. Each bone assists in the formation of\r\nthree cavities: the floor and the outer wall of the nose, the roof of\r\nthe mouth, and the floor of the orbit.\r\n\r\n_Inferior Turbinated Bones._—The inferior turbinated bones are situated\r\none on each side of the outer wall of the nasal fossae.\r\n\r\n_Vomer._—The vomer, a single bone, is situated vertically at the back\r\npart of the nasal fossae, forming part of the septum of the nose. It is\r\nthin and somewhat like a ploughshare in form.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Hyoid Bone.=—_The hyoid bone_ is named from its resemblance to the\r\nGreek letter U. It is also called the lingual bone, because it supports\r\nthe tongue and gives attachment to its numerous muscles.\r\n\r\nThe omo-hyoid muscle, which crosses the carotid artery at its middle\r\nthird, has its insertion with the hyoid bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Bones of the Thorax.=—_The Sternum_ or _Breast Bone_.—The sternum\r\nis a flat, narrow bone, situated in the median line of the front of\r\nthe chest. The lower end is called the ensiform process, to which the\r\ndiaphragm has its anterior attachment.\r\n\r\n_The Ribs._—The ribs, which are curved arches of bone, form the chief\r\npart of the thoracic walls. There are twelve in number on each side,\r\nalthough this number may vary.\r\n\r\nThe ribs are divided into seven pairs of true ribs, three pairs of\r\nfalse ribs, and two pairs of floating ribs, as the following outline\r\nwill show:\r\n\r\n  Ribs\r\n\r\n   7 true\r\n   3 false\r\n   2 floating\r\n  ——\r\n  12 pairs in all.\r\n\r\nThe true ribs are connected behind to the spine and in front to the\r\nsternum.\r\n\r\nThe false ribs are connected behind to the spine, but are called false\r\nbecause they are not attached directly to the sternum, but indirectly,\r\nthe cartilages attaching to the cartilage of the rib next above.\r\n\r\nThe floating ribs are so named because they are only attached at one\r\nplace, which is the spine and are loose or float in front.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Bones of the Upper Extremities.=—_The Shoulder girdle_ consists of\r\nthe _clavicle_ and _scapula_.\r\n\r\n_The Clavicle._—The clavicle or key bone, so-called because of its\r\nsupposed resemblance to the key used by the Romans, forms the anterior\r\nportion of the shoulder girdle. It is often commonly called the collar\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n_The Scapula._—The scapula comes from a Greek word meaning “a spade.”\r\nIt forms the back part of the shoulder girdle.\r\n\r\n_The arm_ is that portion of the upper extremity which is situated\r\nbetween the shoulder and the elbow.\r\n\r\n_The Humerus._—This is the largest and strongest bone of the upper\r\nextremity and is found in the arm between the shoulder and the elbow.\r\nIt is the only bone in the arm.\r\n\r\n_The fore arm_ is that portion of the upper extremity which is situated\r\nbetween the elbow and the wrist. The fore arm has two bones, the _ulna_\r\nand the _radius_.\r\n\r\n_The Ulna._—A long thin bone, but larger than the radius, and situated\r\non the inside of the fore arm.\r\n\r\n_The Radius._—So-called because it is the rotary bone of the fore arm.\r\nIt is situated on the outside of the fore arm and parallel with the\r\nulna.\r\n\r\n_The hand_ is subdivided into the wrist or _carpus_ bones, the\r\n_metacarpus_ or the bones of the palm, and the _phalanges_ or the bones\r\nof the digits. There are twenty-seven bones in each hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Bones of the Lower Extremities.=—The bones of the lower\r\nextremities consist of _the pelvic girdle_, _the thigh_, _the leg_ and\r\n_the foot_.\r\n\r\n_The pelvic girdle_ consists of three portions, the _ilium_, the\r\n_pubis_, and the _ischium_.\r\n\r\n_The Ilium._—The ilium is the superior, broad and expanded portion and\r\nforms the prominence of the hip. The top part is called _the crest_.\r\n\r\n_The Ischium._—The ischium is the lowest portion of the girdle, and is\r\nthe portion which supports the body when in a sitting position.\r\n\r\n_The Pubis._—This bone forms the front of the pelvis, and supports the\r\nexternal organs of generation.\r\n\r\n_The thigh_ is that portion of the lower extremity which is situated\r\nbetween the pelvis and the knee. It consists of a single bone called\r\nthe femur.\r\n\r\n_The Femur._—The femur is the largest, longest and strongest bone in\r\nthe skeleton. It is almost perfectly cylindrical. It extends from the\r\nhip to the knee.\r\n\r\nThe bones of the leg are three in number and are as follows: patella,\r\ntibia, and fibula.\r\n\r\n_The Patella._—This bone is often called the knee cap or the knee pan.\r\nIt is a flat triangular bone, situated at the anterior part of the knee\r\njoint.\r\n\r\n_The Tibia._—The tibia is situated at the front and inner side of the\r\nleg, and is next to the femur in strength and size. It is sometimes\r\ncalled the shin bone.\r\n\r\n_The Fibula._—The fibula is sometimes called the calf bone. It is\r\nsituated at the outer side of the leg, and is a quite slender bone.\r\n\r\nThe foot is divided into the _tarsus_, _metatarsus_, and the\r\n_phalanges_. There are seven tarsus bones, five metatarsus bones, and\r\nfourteen phalanges bones, making a total of twenty-six bones for each\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nORGANOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe body itself is divided into the upper and the lower extremities\r\nand the trunk. The upper extremities consist of the head and arms. The\r\nlower extremities consist of the legs. The trunk is that part of the\r\nbody remaining after the head, arms, and legs have been severed from\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cavities.=—The body has three principal cavities: namely, the\r\ncerebro-spinal, the thoracic, and the abdominal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cerebro-Spinal Cavity.=—The cerebro-spinal cavity is formed by the\r\ncranial bones, and the vertebral column. The cerebro-spinal cavity is\r\ndivided into the sub-cavities, called the cranial cavity and the spinal\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\n_In the cranial cavity_ we find the brain. The brain is the seat of the\r\nmind, and the functions which the brain performs distinguishes man from\r\nthe other animals, as man becomes a conscious, intelligent, responsible\r\nbeing through the action of the brain. The brain is egg-shaped, soft\r\nand yielding, closely fitting the cranial cavity. The front and top of\r\nthe brain is called the cerebrum, which is the center for intelligence,\r\nreason, and will. This part of the brain is convoluted, and the\r\ndepth of the convolutions to a great extent indicates the amount of\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nBelow the cerebrum and lying in front of the occipital bone, we find\r\nthe cerebellum, which is the seat of memory and the center for the\r\nco-ordination of muscle movements. By co-ordination of muscle movement\r\nis meant that the muscles will do just what we want them to do, that\r\nthey will act harmoniously, the one with the other. The condition of\r\nSaint Vitus' Dance would be an example showing a lack of co-ordination.\r\nThis part of the brain is also convoluted.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 15—Brain and spinal cord.]\r\n\r\nBetween the cerebrum and the cerebellum, and connecting the two,\r\nis found the pons Varolii. The word pons means bridge, and the word\r\nVarolii means to cross over. It is in this part of the brain, then,\r\nthat the nerve fibers cross over to the opposite side. A person having\r\na paralytic stroke on the right side of the body would indicate that\r\nthe left side of the brain had become affected.\r\n\r\nJoined to this is the medulla oblongata. This is the lowest part of the\r\nbrain and is the connecting link between the brain and the spinal cord.\r\nThe medulla controls the circulation, respiration, and deglutition\r\n(swallowing).\r\n\r\nClosely adhering to the brain, is a delicate membrane, sinking into\r\nthe convolutions, and following the surface of the brain valleys\r\nthroughout. This membrane is called the pia mater. In it is found\r\nthe capillaries, which supply the brain with its nutritive blood\r\nin life and with embalming fluid after death. These capillaries do\r\nnot penetrate the substance of the brain, but the process is one of\r\nosmosis, absorption or transfusion. Covering the outer most part of\r\nthe brain, and closely adhering to the cranial bones is a dense, tough,\r\nglistening, membrane, called the dura mater. In the dura mater is found\r\nthe sinuses of the brain.\r\n\r\nIn between the pia mater and the dura mater is a delicate double\r\nmembrane forming a closed sack, called the arachnoid membrane. This sac\r\ncontains a serous fluid, which offers great protection to the brain.\r\nThese same three membranes also cover the spinal cord, and are called\r\nall together the meninges of the brain and cord.\r\n\r\nThe brain is composed of white and gray matter. The gray matter is on\r\nthe outside, and the white matter is on the inside.\r\n\r\n_The spinal cavity_ is formed by the bones of the vertebral column.\r\nIn this spinal cavity is found the spinal cord. It is cylindrical and\r\nusually about seventeen inches in length, and extends from the medulla\r\noblongata, to the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra, where it\r\nterminates in a slender filament of gray substance.\r\n\r\nThere originate from the under surface of the brain twelve pairs of\r\nnerves, as follows:\r\n\r\n   1. Olfactory\r\n   2. Optic\r\n   3. Motor Oculi\r\n   4. Trochlear\r\n   5. Trigeminal\r\n   6. Abducens\r\n   7. Facial\r\n   8. Auditory\r\n   9. Glosso-pharyngeal\r\n  10. Pneumogastric\r\n  11. Spinal accessory\r\n  12. Hypoglossal\r\n\r\nThere originate from the cord thirty-one pairs of nerves, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Cervical region       8 pairs.\r\n  Thoracic region      12   “\r\n  Lumbar region         5   “\r\n  Sacral region         5   “\r\n  Coccygeal region      1   “\r\n                       ——\r\n                       31   “\r\n\r\nThe circulation of the blood through the brain will be taken up later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nORGANOLOGY.—Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Thoracic Cavity.=—The thorax, or chest is a bony, cartilaginous\r\ncage. It contains and protects the principle organs of respiration and\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nThe thorax is bounded in front by the sternum and costal cartilages,\r\nbehind by the twelve dorsal vertebrae and the posterior parts of the\r\nribs, on the sides by the ribs, above by the root of the neck and below\r\nby the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 16—Front view of the thorax. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nIn the female the thorax differs as follows from the male: Its general\r\ncapacity is less, the sternum is shorter, and the upper ribs are more\r\nmovable and so allow a greater enlargement of the upper part of the\r\nthorax than the male.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the cavity of the thorax does not correspond with its\r\napparent size externally, because, (1) the space enclosed by the lower\r\nribs is occupied by some of the abdominal viscera; and (2) the cavity\r\nextends above the first rib into the neck. The size of the cavity of\r\nthe thorax is constantly varying during life, with the movements of the\r\nribs and diaphragm, and with the degree of distention of the abdominal\r\nviscera.\r\n\r\nFrom the collapsed state of the lungs, as seen when the thorax is\r\nopened, in the dead body, it would appear as if the viscera only partly\r\nfilled the cavity of the thorax, but during life there is no vacant\r\nspace, that which is seen after death being filled up during life by\r\nthe expanded lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Larynx.=—The larynx is the organ of voice, placed at the upper part\r\nof the air passage. It is situated between the trachea and the base\r\nof the tongue, at the upper and forepart of the neck, where it forms a\r\nconsiderable projection in the middle line. It is for this reason that\r\nit is of considerable importance to embalmers, for it is just opposite\r\nthis projection, on either side of the neck, that the common carotid\r\ndivides into the internal and the external carotid.\r\n\r\nOn either side of it lie the great blood vessels of the neck, behind\r\nit forms a part of the boundary of the pharynx, and is covered by the\r\nmucous membrane lining that cavity.\r\n\r\nIts vertical extent corresponds to the fourth, fifth, and sixth\r\ncervical vertebrae. It is placed somewhat higher in the female than in\r\nthe male.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the head affect the position of the larynx. When the\r\nhead is drawn back, the larynx is lifted, and when the chin approaches\r\nthe chest the larynx is depressed. During swallowing the larynx moves\r\ndistinctly; during singing it moves slightly.\r\n\r\nUntil puberty there is no marked difference between the larynx of\r\nthe male and that of the female. In the male after puberty all the\r\ncartilages increase in size, and the larynx becomes prominent as\r\nthe Adam's apple in the middle line of the neck. In the female after\r\npuberty the increase of size is only slight.\r\n\r\nThe larynx is broad above, where it presents a triangular appearance,\r\nflattened behind and at the sides. Below it is narrow and cylindrical.\r\n\r\nIt is composed of cartilages which are connected together by ligaments\r\nand moved by numerous muscles. It is lined by a mucous membrane which\r\nis continuous above with the lining of the pharynx and below with that\r\nof the trachea.\r\n\r\nThe arteries that supply the larynx are the laryngeal arteries,\r\nbranches of the superior and inferior thyroid arteries.\r\n\r\nThe superior laryngeal vein runs into the superior thyroid vein and\r\nthen into the internal jugular vein, while the inferior laryngeal vein\r\nruns into the inferior thyroid vein and then into the innominate vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Trachea.=—The trachea or windpipe is a cartilaginous elastic,\r\ncylindrical tube, flattened posteriorly. It extends from the lower part\r\nof the larynx, on a level with the sixth cervical vertebra to opposite\r\nthe body of the fourth dorsal, where it divides into two bronchi, one\r\nfor each lung.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 17—The cartilages of the larynx; the\r\n   trachea and bronchi. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nThe trachea is in the median line of the body. It measures about four\r\nand one-half inches in length. The diameter is from three quarters to\r\none inch, being always greater in the male than in the female.\r\n\r\nThe trachea is composed of imperfect cartilage rings, not coming quite\r\ntogether in the back.\r\n\r\nThe artery that supplies the trachea is the inferior thyroid artery.\r\n\r\nThe vein that withdraws the blood is the inferior thyroid vein.\r\n\r\n_The Right Bronchus._—The right bronchus is shorter, and wider than\r\nthe left bronchus. It is about one inch in length. It enters the lung\r\nopposite the fifth dorsal vertebra.\r\n\r\n_The Left Bronchus._—The left bronchus is smaller and longer than\r\nthe right. It is two inches in length and enters the lung at a point\r\nopposite the body of the sixth dorsal vertebra.\r\n\r\nEach bronchus divides into smaller divisions called bronchial tubes.\r\n\r\nEach bronchial tube divides into still smaller divisions called\r\nbronchioles.\r\n\r\nEach bronchiole ends in the air cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Pleurae.=—Each lung is invested upon its external surface by an\r\nexceedingly delicate serous membrane, the pleura. This encloses the\r\norgan as far as its root, and is then reflected upon the inner surface\r\nof the thorax.\r\n\r\nThe _pulmonary pleura_ is the portion investing the surface of the\r\nlung, and dipping into the fissures between its lobes.\r\n\r\nThe _parietal pleura_ is that which lines the inner surface of the\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nThe space between these two layers is called the cavity of the pleurae,\r\n(the pleural cavity); and contains nothing but a very little clear\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nIn the healthy condition the two layers are in contact and there is no\r\nreal cavity, but after death the lungs become collapsed and separate\r\nfrom the walls of the chest. Each pleura is therefore a shut sac, one\r\noccupying the right, and the other the left half of the thorax, and\r\nthey are perfectly separated from one another. The two pleurae do not\r\nmeet in the middle line of the chest, excepting for a short distance\r\nbetween the second and third pieces of the sternum—a space being left\r\nbetween them, which contains all the viscera of the thorax excepting\r\nthe lungs; this is called the mediastinum.\r\n\r\nThe mediastinum then, is the space between the right and left pleural\r\nsacs.\r\n\r\nThe arteries of the pleura are derived from the intercostal, internal\r\nmammary, musculo-phrenic, thymic, pericardiac, bronchial.\r\n\r\nThe veins correspond to the arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Lungs.=—The lungs are the essential organs of respiration. They\r\nare two in number, placed one on each side of the chest, separated from\r\neach other by the heart and the contents of the mediastinum. A healthy\r\nlung hangs free within the pulmonary space. The lung is suspended\r\nby the root. The root of the lung is formed by the bronchial tubes,\r\npulmonary artery, pulmonary veins, bronchial arteries, bronchial veins,\r\netc., all of which are enclosed by the reflections of the pleurae.\r\n\r\nThe _root of the lung_ may be described as being that part where all\r\nthe great blood vessels and the bronchial tubes, enter the lungs.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the lung does not hang free, but as a result of former\r\npleurisy, the area of the pulmonary pleura is adherent to the parietal\r\npleura.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 18—The root of the left lung. (Toldt)]\r\n\r\nEach lung is conical in shape, and presents for examination, an apex,\r\na base, and two surfaces.\r\n\r\n_The Apex_ forms a tapering cone which extends into the root of the\r\nneck about an inch and a half to two inches above the level of the top\r\nof the first rib.\r\n\r\n_The Base_ is broad and concave and rests upon the convex surface of\r\nthe diaphragm, which separates the right lung from the upper surface of\r\nthe right lobe of the liver and the left lung from the upper surface of\r\nthe left lobe of the liver, the stomach, and spleen.\r\n\r\n_Surfaces._—There are two in number. The external, costal or thoracic\r\nsurface is smooth, convex and corresponds to the form of the cavity of\r\nthe chest. The inner or mediastinal surface is concave, and the middle\r\nportion, where all the vessels enter and leave the lung is called the\r\nroot.\r\n\r\n_Lobes._—Each lung is divided up into lobes. The right lung has three\r\nlobes, and the left lung has two lobes.\r\n\r\n_Weight._—The weight of both lungs together is about 42 ounces, the\r\nright lung being a little heavier than the left. The lungs are heavier\r\nin the male than in the female. The male lungs weigh from 42 to 45\r\nounces, and the female lungs weigh from 32 to 35 ounces.\r\n\r\n_Color._—The color of the lungs at birth is a pinkish white, in adult\r\nlife a dark slate color, mottled in patches and as age advances this\r\nmottling assumes a black color.\r\n\r\n_Substance._—The substance of the lung is of a light porous, spongy\r\ntexture. It floats in water, if it has once been filled with air. It\r\nis elastic and for this reason we always find the lung collapsed after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the lung is such that the blood brought by the\r\npulmonary artery comes into close relation with the air in the\r\nair-cells which enters from the bronchioles. The blood gives off carbon\r\ndioxide to the air-cells and the air in the cells furnishes oxygen for\r\nthe blood. The process of respiration causes the dark blood brought\r\nfrom the heart by the pulmonary arteries to return to the heart as red\r\nblood in the pulmonary veins.\r\n\r\n_Arteries._—The bronchial arteries supply the lungs with nutrition.\r\n\r\nThe pulmonary arteries convey venous blood from the heart to the lungs\r\nto be purified.\r\n\r\n_Veins._—The bronchial veins carry off the impure blood from the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe pulmonary veins convey the blood which has been purified by the\r\nlungs, back to the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Mediastinum=.—The mediastinum is the space left in the middle\r\nportion of the chest by the non-approximation of the two pleurae. It\r\nextends from the sternum in front to the spine behind.\r\n\r\nWithin it are the contents of the thorax, excepting the lungs. The\r\nmediastinum may be divided into two parts.\r\n\r\n_The superior mediastinum_ is that portion of the interpleural space\r\nwhich lies above the level of the pericardium. This space contains the\r\narch of the aorta, innominate, part of the left carotid artery, part of\r\nthe left subclavian artery, the upper half of the superior vena cava,\r\nthe upper half of the innominate vein, the left superior intercostal\r\nvein, trachea, esophagus, thoracic duct, remains of the thymus gland,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe inferior mediastinum is divided into three portions:\r\n\r\n_The anterior mediastinum_ is that portion in front of the pericardium.\r\nIt contains nothing but some loose areolar tissue.\r\n\r\n_The posterior mediastinum_ is that portion back of the pericardium. It\r\ncontains the descending thoracic aorta, the greater and lesser azygos\r\nveins, the esophagus, the thoracic duct, etc.\r\n\r\n_The middle mediastinum_ is that part within the pericardium or heart\r\nsac. It is the largest space of all the mediastinal spaces. It contains\r\nthe heart, the ascending aorta, the lower half of the superior vena\r\ncava, the vena azygos, the bifurcation of the trachea, the pulmonary\r\nartery, etc.\r\n\r\nThe middle mediastinum is sometimes called the cardiac cavity, because\r\nit contains the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Pericardium (Heart Sac).=—The pericardium is a serous sac in which\r\nis located the heart and the commencement of the great blood vessels.\r\n\r\nBehind we find the bronchi, esophagus and descending thoracic aorta. To\r\nthe sides we find the pleura, the phrenic nerve and the accompanying\r\nvessels. In front we find the sternum and the remains of the thymus\r\ngland. It is attached above to the great blood vessels and below to the\r\ndiaphragm.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Heart.=—The heart is a hollow, muscular organ of a conical (cone\r\nshaped) form, placed between the lungs and enclosed in the pericardium.\r\n\r\nThe heart is placed obliquely in the chest. The base is directed\r\nupward, backward and to the right, and corresponds to the dorsal\r\nvertebrae from the fifth to the eighth inclusive.\r\n\r\nThe apex is directed downward, forward and to the left and corresponds\r\nto the space between the cartilages between the fifth and sixth ribs.\r\n\r\nThe exact location of the apex of the heart would be ¾-inch to the\r\ninner side, and an inch and one-half below the left nipple, or about\r\nthree and one-half inches from the middle line of the sternum or breast\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 19—A cross section of the heart showing\r\n   valves. (Spalteholz)]\r\n\r\nThe heart is placed behind the sternum, and extends about three inches\r\nto the left of the median line, and about one and one-half inches to\r\nthe right, or in other words, about one-third of the heart lies to the\r\nright of the median line, and two-thirds lies to the left of the median\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe heart in the adult measures five inches in length, three and\r\none-half inches in breadth in its broadest part, and two and one-half\r\ninches in thickness. The weight of the male heart varies from ten to\r\ntwelve ounces, and that of the female from eight to ten ounces.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the ventricles of the heart averages about three and\r\none-half ounces of blood to each ventricle, and the auricle a little\r\nless than four ounces, making the total capacity of the heart average\r\nabout fifteen ounces.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 20—The right auricle and ventricle laid\r\n   open. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nThe heart is divided by a muscular septum (separation wall) into two\r\nlateral halves, which are named respectively the right or venous side\r\nand the left or arterial side. The septum is called the longitudinal\r\nseptum. Each side of the heart is further sub-divided into an upper\r\nand lower compartment, the upper on each side is called the auricle and\r\nthe lower the ventricle. The upper and lower compartments of the heart\r\n(auricles and ventricles) are separated by the auricular-ventricular\r\nseptums (meaning a separation between the auricle and ventricle).\r\n\r\nThe superior and inferior venae cavae empty into the right auricle of\r\nthe heart, also the blood from the coronary sinus.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this compartment receives all the venous or impure blood\r\nfrom all parts of the body, and sends it through what is known as the\r\ntricuspid valve into the right ventricle or lower compartment. After\r\ngetting into the right ventricle, the blood is sent forth into the\r\nlungs by first passing through the pulmonary semi-lunar valve into the\r\npulmonary artery, which enters the lungs at the root of the same.\r\n\r\nThis would then finish the circulation through the right side of the\r\nheart, and after the purification has been accomplished by the lungs,\r\nwe find the blood being returned to the left side of the heart through\r\nthe four pulmonary veins. The pulmonary veins extend from the lungs\r\n(two on each side) to the left auricle (upper compartment of the heart)\r\nand deliver the purified blood to the left or arterial side. The course\r\nof the blood from the left auricle is downward into the left ventricle\r\n(or lower compartment) through what is known as the bicuspid or mitral\r\nvalve.\r\n\r\nThe blood is then sent out into the body to nourish all the tissues, by\r\nbeing forced through the aortic semi-lunar valve into the great aorta\r\nartery. The circulation is then completed by the blood running into\r\nthe branch arteries and from them into the smaller branches and into\r\nthe capillaries from which the course of the blood is into the smaller\r\nveins and into the larger veins, finally terminating into the two large\r\ntrunk veins, the ascending (or inferior) and descending (or superior)\r\nvenae cavae. Of these two large trunk veins the ascending vena cava\r\nis the only one to have a valve at its termination (eustachian). The\r\nfunctions of this valve are to prevent a backward flow of blood into\r\nthe vein from the auricle.\r\n\r\nThe heart has three walls, the inner wall is called the endocardium,\r\nthe middle wall is called the myocardium, and the outer wall is called\r\nthe epicardium.\r\n\r\nThe heart is surrounded by a serous sac called the pericardium.\r\n\r\nThe heart receives its blood supply from the coronary arteries, which\r\nare branches of the ascending aorta, just after it leaves the aortic\r\nsemi-lunar valve.\r\n\r\nThe coronary veins bring the venous blood back from the tissues of the\r\nheart and empty into the coronary sinus, back of the right auricle of\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\nThe veins which originate about the region of the right auricle, empty\r\ndirectly into the right auricle of the heart through the valves of\r\nThebesii.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Alimentary Canal.=—The alimentary canal is a muscular membranous\r\ntube. It is about thirty feet in length, and extends from the mouth to\r\nthe anus. It is lined throughout by a mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nThe following outline will show the parts of the alimentary canal:\r\n\r\n              Mouth\r\n              Pharynx\r\n              Oesophagus\r\n              Stomach\r\n                    { Duodenum\r\n  Small Intestines  { Jejunum\r\n                    { Ileum\r\n\r\n                    { Caecum\r\n  Large Intestines  { Colon\r\n                    { Rectum\r\n\r\nThe accessory organs to the alimentary canal are the following:\r\n\r\nTeeth, Salivary glands, Liver, Spleen, Pancreas.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Mouth.=—The mouth is placed at the commencement of the alimentary\r\ncanal. It is a nearly oval shaped cavity.\r\n\r\nIn this cavity the mastication of the food and the insalivation of the\r\nfood takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Teeth.=—The structure of the teeth has been considered under the\r\nhead of tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Palate.=—The palate forms the roof of the mouth. It consists of\r\ntwo portions: The hard palate is in front and the soft palate is in the\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Salivary Glands.=—By the term salivary glands is usually\r\nunderstood the three chief glands on each side of the face.\r\n\r\nThe parotid gland is placed near the ear. The submaxillary gland is\r\nplaced below the jaw. The sublingual gland is placed below the tongue.\r\n\r\nThese glands secrete the salival juices which are brought into the\r\nmouth by three small ducts, where it aids in the digestion of the food.\r\nThe digestive action of the saliva is limited to the starchy foods. Its\r\naction is to change starches into sugars.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 21—Passage into trachea and esophagus;\r\n   Pharynx.]\r\n\r\nIt also fulfills other important functions. By moistening the food\r\nit enables us to reduce the material to a consistency suitable for\r\nswallowing and for manipulation by the tongue and other muscles. The\r\nsaliva also serves as a kind of lubricator that insures the smooth\r\npassage along oesophageal canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Pharynx.=—The pharynx is that part of the alimentary canal, which\r\nis placed behind, and communicates with the nose, mouth and larynx. It\r\nis a muscular, membranous tube which extends from the back of the mouth\r\nand under surface of the skull to the level of the cricoid cartilage or\r\nto a point between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae.\r\n\r\nThe pharynx is about four and one-half inches in length.\r\n\r\nSeven openings communicate with it, as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo posterior nares, two eustachian tubes, mouth, larynx, esophagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Esophagus.=—The esophagus or gullet is a muscular canal about nine\r\nor ten inches in length, extending from the pharynx to the stomach.\r\n\r\nIt begins at a point between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae and\r\ndescends along in front of the spine through the posterior mediastinal\r\nspace, passes through the diaphragm, and entering the abdomen,\r\nterminates in the stomach wall at a point opposite the tenth dorsal\r\nvertebra.\r\n\r\nAt its commencement it is placed in the median line and gradually\r\ninclines to the left as it passes forward to the esophageal opening to\r\nthe diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe esophagus is from one-half to an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nArteries.—The arteries which supply the esophagus are the esophageal,\r\nwhich are branches from the aorta.\r\n\r\nVeins.—The esophageal veins empty into the ascending vena cava.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Diaphragm.=—The diaphragm (a partition wall) is a dense, muscular,\r\nfibrous septum, placed obliquely across the trunk. It separates the\r\nthoracic from the abdominal cavity, forming the floor of the thoracic\r\nand the roof of the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\nIt is attached in front to the ensiform process of the sternum, on\r\nthe sides to the inner surface of the cartilages and bony portions of\r\nsix or seven inferior ribs, and behind it is attached to the lumbar\r\nvertebrae.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm has three openings, as follows: opening for the\r\nesophagus, opening for the aorta, opening for the ascending vena cava.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm is the principal muscle of respiration.\r\n\r\nThe arteries which supply the diaphragm are the phrenic arteries.\r\n\r\nThe phrenic veins receive the blood from the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nORGANOLOGY.—Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Abdomen.=—The abdomen is the largest cavity in the body. It is\r\noval in form, the extremities of the oval being directed upward and\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate description, the abdomen is artificially divided into two\r\nparts:\r\n\r\nAn upper and larger part, the abdomen proper.\r\n\r\nA lower and smaller part, the pelvis.\r\n\r\nThese two cavities are not separated from each other, but the limit\r\nbetween them is a line drawn around the brim of the true pelvis.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen proper differs from the other great cavities of the body,\r\nin being bounded for the most part by muscles and fascia.\r\n\r\nIt varies in capacity and shape according to the condition of the\r\nviscera which it contains and in addition, it varies in form and extent\r\nwith age and sex.\r\n\r\nBoundaries.—The diaphragm forms the dome over the abdomen, the cavity\r\nof the abdomen extending high into the bony thorax.\r\n\r\nThe lower end of the abdomen is limited by the bones of the pelvis.\r\n\r\nIn front and at the sides it is bounded by the lower ribs and abdominal\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nBehind by the vertebral column and muscles.\r\n\r\nRegions.—For convenience of description of the viscera, the abdomen is\r\nartificially divided into nine regions. Thus if two circular lines are\r\ndrawn around the body, the one at the extremities of the ninth ribs\r\nwhere they join the costal cartilages, and the other around the crest\r\nof the ileum, the abdominal cavity is divided into three zones.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 22—The regions of the abdomen and their\r\n   contents. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nIf two parallel lines are now drawn perpendicular upward from the\r\ncenter of Poupart's ligament, each of these zones is subdivided into\r\nthree parts.\r\n\r\nThe middle region of the upper zone is called the epigastric; and the\r\ntwo lateral regions, the right and left hypochondriac. The central\r\nregion of the middle zone is called the umbilical; and the two lateral\r\nregions, the right and left lumbar regions. The middle region of the\r\nlower zone is called the hypogastric; and the two lateral regions are\r\ncalled the right and the left inguinal regions.\r\n\r\nThe viscera contained in each of these are as follows:\r\n\r\n   Right Hypochondriac  |   Epigastric Region   |  Left Hypochondriac\r\n                        |                       |\r\n  The greater part of   | The greater part of   | The fundus of the\r\n  the right lobe of the | the stomach including | stomach, the spleen,\r\n  liver, the hepatic    | both cardiac and      | the extremity of the\r\n  flexure of the colon  | pyloric orifices, the | pancreas, the splenic\r\n  and part of the right | left lobe and part of | flexure of the colon\r\n  kidney.               | the right lobe of the | and part of the left\r\n                        | liver and the gall-   | kidney and small\r\n                        | bladder, the          | portion of the left\r\n                        | pancreas, the         | lobe of the liver.\r\n                        | duodenum, the         |\r\n                        | suprarenal capsules   |\r\n                        | and parts of the      |\r\n                        | kidneys.              |\r\n  ——————————————————————+———————————————————————+——————————————————————\r\n      Right Lumbar      |   Umbilical Region    |      Left Lumbar\r\n                        |                       |\r\n  Ascending colon, part | The transverse colon, | Descending colon,\r\n  of the right kidney   | part of the great     | part of the omentum,\r\n  and some convolutions | omentum and           | part of the left\r\n  of the small          | mesentery, transverse | kidney and some\r\n  intestines.           | part of the duodenum  | convolutions of the\r\n                        | and some convolutions | small intestines.\r\n                        | of the jejunum and    |\r\n                        | ileum and part of     |\r\n                        | both kidneys.         |\r\n  ——————————————————————+———————————————————————+——————————————————————\r\n    Right Inguinal or   |  Hypogastric Region   |   Left Inguinal or\r\n          Iliac         |                       |         Iliac\r\n                        | Convolutions of the   |\r\n  The caecum and        | small intestines, the | Sigmoid flexure of\r\n  vermiform appendix    | bladder in children   | the colon and a\r\n  and a portion of the  | and in adults if      | portion of the\r\n  ascending colon.      | distended, and the    | descending colon.\r\n                        | uterus during         |\r\n                        | pregnancy.            |\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Stomach.=—The stomach is the principal organ of digestion. It is\r\nthe most dilated part of the alimentary canal, and is situated between\r\nthe termination of the esophagus and the commencement of the small\r\nintestines. It is placed in part immediately behind the anterior wall\r\nof the abdomen and beneath the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n_The lesser curvature_ of the stomach extends between the cardiac and\r\nthe pyloric orifices along the right border of the organ.\r\n\r\n_The greater curvature_ of the stomach is directed to the left, and is\r\nfour or five times as long as the lesser curvature.\r\n\r\n_The cardia_ is the point at which the esophagus enters the stomach\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 23—The coeliac axis and its branches.\r\n   (Gray)]\r\n\r\n_The cardiac orifice_ is the opening by which the esophagus\r\ncommunicates with the stomach. It is sometimes called the esophageal\r\nopening. It is situated on a level with the body of the tenth and\r\neleventh dorsal vertebrae. It is to the left of and in front of\r\nthe aorta. On the anterior surface of the body the cardiac orifice\r\ncorresponds to the articulation of the seventh left costal cartilage to\r\nthe sternum.\r\n\r\n_The pylorus_ is the point at which the stomach passes into the\r\nduodenum.\r\n\r\n_The pyloric orifice_ is the opening by means of which the stomach\r\ncommunicates with the duodenum.\r\n\r\nThis orifice is guarded by the _pyloric valve_. When the stomach is\r\nempty the pylorus is situated just to the right of the median line of\r\nthe body on a level with the upper border of the first lumbar vertebra.\r\nOn the anterior surface of the body its position would be indicated by\r\na point one inch below the tip of the ensiform process and a little to\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nThe size of the stomach varies considerable in different subjects.\r\nThe distance between the two orifices is from three to six inches. The\r\nweight of the stomach is about four and one-half ounces.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the adult male stomach is from five to eight pints. The\r\nstomach of a new born child holds about one ounce.\r\n\r\nThe stomach is held in place by the attachment of the esophagus to\r\nthe diaphragm and the fixation of the duodenum to the front of the\r\nvertebral column.\r\n\r\nThe wall of the stomach consists of four coats: serous, muscular,\r\nareolar, and mucous.\r\n\r\nThe glands of the stomach are of three kinds: gastric, pyloric, and\r\ncardiac. These glands furnish the digestive enzymes of the stomach,\r\nnamely: pepsin, renin, and hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n_Arteries._—The arteries that supply the stomach are the gastric, and\r\nbranches from the splenic and the hepatic.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that when a body is arterially injected after\r\ndeath, that the fluid only goes to the stomach walls and there ends in\r\nthe capillary system. No doubt a little of this fluid will soak through\r\ninto the inside of the stomach, and tend to preserve the contents\r\nof the stomach, but it must be added that if the stomach contains a\r\nconsiderable quantity of food and water, that there will not be enough\r\nfluid soak through the stomach wall to preserve the contents of the\r\nstomach and as a result gases arise which cause distention of the\r\nabdomen and perhaps purging from the mouth and nose. As a rule then\r\nit is safe to say that when we have purging from the mouth and nose,\r\nwith a visible distention of the abdominal cavity, indicating gases in\r\nthe stomach and the intestines that fluid has not reached the contents\r\nof the stomach and the fecal matter of the intestines, and therefore\r\nit will be necessary to introduce fluid to these parts, in order to\r\npreserve the contents, and prevent further formation of gases. The\r\nmethod for doing this will be given under cavity embalming.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Small Intestines.=—The small intestine is a convoluted tube,\r\nextending from the pyloric end of the stomach to the ileo-caecal valve\r\nwhere it terminates in the large intestines. It fills up the greater\r\npart of the abdominal and the pelvic cavity. It is about twenty feet\r\nin length and gradually diminishes in size from the commencement to the\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nThe small intestines are surrounded at the top and at the sides by\r\nthe large intestines. The small intestines are held in place by the\r\nmesentery, a part of the peritoneum, which connects or fastens to the\r\nspine.\r\n\r\nThe small intestines are divisible into three portions: Duodenum,\r\nJejunum, and the Ileum.\r\n\r\n_Arteries._—The main arterial supply to the small intestines is through\r\nthe superior mesenteric artery.\r\n\r\nThe superior mesenteric vein withdraws the main part of the blood from\r\nthe small intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Duodenum.=—The duodenum has received its name from being about equal\r\nin length to the breadth of twelve fingers (ten inches).\r\n\r\nIt is the shortest, widest and the most fixed part of the small\r\nintestines, being closely and firmly attached to the posterior\r\nabdominal wall. It is not covered by the mesentery. The upper half of\r\nthe duodenum is in the epigastric region and the lower half is in the\r\numbilical region. It is practically in the median line of the body.\r\n\r\nThe duodenum is shaped like a horseshoe, the opening being directed\r\ntoward the left. The arteries supplying the duodenum are the pyloric\r\nand the pancreatic duodenal branch of the superior mesenteric. The\r\nveins correspond to the arteries.\r\n\r\nThe pancreatic duct and the bile duct empty into the duodenum at its\r\nmiddle portion.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Jejunum.=—The jejunum is the second portion of the small intestines,\r\nit derives its name from the latin word “jejunas,” meaning empty,\r\nbecause it was formerly supposed to be empty after death.\r\n\r\nIt is wider, thicker, more vascular and of a deeper color than the\r\nileum. The jejunum is about eight feet in length or two-fifths of the\r\nlength of the small intestines.\r\n\r\nThe arteries which supply the jejunum are the branches of the superior\r\nmesenteric artery. The veins are of the same name.\r\n\r\nThe jejunum is fastened to the posterior wall of the abdomen by an\r\nextensive fold of the mesentery.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ileum.=—The ileum is derived from a Greek word meaning to twist,\r\nand is so named on account of its numerous coils and convolutions. It\r\nis the third portion of the small intestines and is placed below the\r\njejunum. It is much narrower and thinner than the jejunum, about twelve\r\nfeet in length or three-fifths of the length of the small intestines.\r\nIt is also attached to the posterior abdominal wall by means of the\r\nmesentery. The arteries which supply the ileum are the branches of the\r\nsuperior mesenteric artery. The veins are of the same name.\r\n\r\n_The villi_ are minute projections on the mucous membrane of the\r\nsmall intestines. They are largest and most numerous in the duodenum\r\nand jejunum, and become fewer and smaller in the ileum. It is in the\r\nvilli of the intestines that we find the termination of the mesenteric\r\narteries, the beginning of the mesenteric veins and the commencement of\r\nthe lacteals.\r\n\r\nAs the food passes down the intestines, having been previously prepared\r\nin the stomach and intestines for absorption, it comes in very close\r\ncontact with the villi of the intestines and it is here that the\r\nnutrition from the food is absorbed through the villi wall into the\r\nlacteals, and hence carried to the receptaculum chylii.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Large Intestines.=—The large intestine extends from the\r\ntermination of the ileum to the anus. It is about five or more feet\r\nin length or about one fifth of the whole extent of the intestinal\r\ncanal. It is largest at its commencement at the caecum, and gradually\r\ndiminishes in size as far as the rectum, where there is a dilatation of\r\nconsiderable size just above the anus.\r\n\r\nThe large intestine differs from the small intestine in its greater\r\nsize, its more fixed position, its sacculated form.\r\n\r\nThe large intestine in its course describes an arch, which surrounds\r\nthe convolutions of the small intestines. It commences in the right\r\ninguinal region, in a dilated part of the caecum. It ascends through\r\nthe right lumbar and the right hypochondriac regions to the under\r\nsurface of the liver, it here takes a bend to the left, the hepatic\r\nflexure, and passes transversely across the abdomen on the confines of\r\nthe epigastric and umbilical regions, to the left hypochondriac region;\r\nit then bends again, the splenic flexure, and descends through the left\r\nlumbar region to the left inguinal region, where it becomes convoluted\r\nand forms the sigmoid flexure; finally it enters the pelvic cavity and\r\ndescends along the posterior wall to the anus.\r\n\r\nThe large intestine is supplied by the branches of the inferior\r\nmesenteric artery, and the veins are of the same name.\r\n\r\nThe large intestines are divided into the caecum, colon and rectum.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Caecum.=—The caecum is the commencement of the large intestines, it\r\nis a large blind pouch situated below the ileo caecal valve. _The ileo\r\ncaecal valve_ is the valve between the exit of the small intestines and\r\nthe commencement of the large intestines. The caecum is held mostly in\r\nplace by the folds of the peritoneum.\r\n\r\n_The Vermiform Appendix._—The appendix is found only in the human, the\r\nhigher apes, and the wombat, although in certain rodents a somewhat\r\nsimilar arrangement exists. The appendix is a long, narrow, worm\r\nshaped, musculo-membranous tube, which starts from the inner side of\r\nthe posterior wall of the caecum, below and behind the termination\r\nof the ileum. It is the seat for a very common disease called\r\nappendicitis. It varies from one half to nine inches in length, its\r\naverage being about three inches. Its diameter is from one eighth to\r\none quarter of an inch.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 24—The caecum and colon laid open to show\r\n   the ileo-caecal valve. (Gray)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Colon.=—The colon is divided into three parts, the ascending,\r\ntransverse and the descending colon.\r\n\r\n_The ascending colon_ is smaller than the caecum, with which it\r\nis continuous. It passes upward from its commencement at a point\r\ncorresponding to the ileo-caecal valve, to the under surface of the\r\nright lobe of the liver, on the right of the gall bladder, where it is\r\nlodged in a shallow depression on the liver; here it bends abruptly\r\ninward to the left, forming the hepatic flexure. It is held to the\r\nposterior wall of the abdomen by folds of the peritoneum.\r\n\r\n_The transverse colon_ is the longest part of the small intestines,\r\npasses transversely from the right to the left across the abdomen,\r\nopposite the confines of the epigastric and umbilical regions, where\r\nit curves downward beneath the lower end of the spleen, forming the\r\nsplenic flexure. In its course the transverse colon describes an arch,\r\nthe concavity of which is directed backward toward the vertebral column\r\nand a little upward.\r\n\r\nThis is the most movable part of the colon, only covered by peritoneum\r\nand held to the back wall by the folds of the peritoneum. The\r\ntransverse colon is in relation, by its upper surface with the liver\r\nand gall bladder the great curvature of the stomach, and the lower end\r\nof the spleen; by its under surface with the small intestines; by its\r\nanterior surface with the anterior layers of the great omentum and the\r\nabdominal wall; its posterior surface on the right is in relation with\r\nthe duodenum and on the left it is in contact with the convolutions of\r\nthe jejunum and ileum.\r\n\r\n_The descending colon_ passes downward through the left hypochondriac\r\nregion and lumbar region along the outer border of the left kidney. At\r\nthe lower end of the left kidney it turns inward where it terminates in\r\nthe formation of the sigmoid flexure. The descending colon is held to\r\nthe back wall by folds of the peritoneum.\r\n\r\nThe sigmoid flexure, the narrowest part of the colon, is situated in\r\nthe left inguinal region and communicates with the rectum.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Rectum.=—The rectum is the terminal part of the large intestines,\r\nand extends from the termination of the sigmoid flexure to the anus.\r\nThe adult rectum in male is from four to six inches in length, and in\r\nthe female is from three to five inches in length.\r\n\r\n_The anus_ is the terminal opening of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Liver.=—The liver is the largest gland in the body, and is situated in\r\nthe upper and right part of the abdominal cavity, occupying almost the\r\nwhole of the right hypochondriac, the greater part of the epigastric,\r\nand extending almost to the middle of the left hypochondriac region.\r\n\r\nIn the male it weighs from fifty to sixty ounces, and in the female,\r\nfrom forty to fifty.\r\n\r\nIt is relatively much larger in the foetus, being about one-eighteenth\r\nof the body weight in the foetus, and in the adult, about\r\none-thirty-sixth of the body weight.\r\n\r\nIts greatest width is from seven to eight inches, is about twelve\r\ninches long, and in its greatest thickness about three inches.\r\n\r\nThe liver is very soft and is easily lacerated and friable; its color\r\nis a dark reddish brown. To obtain a correct idea of its shape, you\r\nmight compare it to a wedge, the base of which is directed to the\r\nright, and thin edge toward the left.\r\n\r\nThe liver has five surfaces, superior, inferior, anterior, posterior\r\nand right lateral.\r\n\r\nThe liver has five lobes, right and left, caudate, quadrate, and lobus\r\nspigelii. It has five ligaments, right and left lateral or triangular,\r\nfalciform, coronary and round. The liver has five fissures, the\r\numbilical, the fissure of the ductus venosus, the transverse fissure,\r\nthe fissure for the gall bladder, the fissure for the vena cava. These\r\nfissures can be represented by the letter H.\r\n\r\n     Fissure of |     BACK     |  Fissure\r\n     Ductus     |              |  inferior\r\n  L  venosus    |              |  vena      R\r\n  E             |  Transverse  |  cava      I\r\n  F  ———————————+——————————————+——————————  G\r\n  T  Umbilical  |              |  Fissure   H\r\n     fissure    |     FRONT    |  for gall  T\r\n                |              |  bladder\r\n                |              |\r\n\r\nThe liver is movable within certain narrow limits. It moves with\r\nrespiration. On inspiration, it moves down with the diaphragm to a\r\nlittle below the right nipple line. The ligaments do not give the liver\r\nmuch support because they lie relaxed, but it does get its main support\r\nfrom the connective tissue which unites the liver to the diaphragm, the\r\nhepatic veins which join the vena cava and also by the intra-abdominal\r\npressure resulting from the tonic contraction of the abdominal muscles.\r\n\r\nAlso when the abdominal tension is normal, the intestines are driven\r\nup, and become a bed for the liver.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 25—Excretory apparatus of the liver.\r\n   (Poirier and Charpy)]\r\n\r\nThe most important function is the secretion of the bile; it is also\r\nthe excretor of deleterious matter and impurities. It also effects\r\nimportant changes of the blood in its passage through it, for the\r\nportal circulation.\r\n\r\nThe excretory apparatus of the liver consists (a) of the hepatic duct,\r\n(b) the gall bladder, (c) cystic duct, (d) the common bile duct.\r\n\r\nThe hepatic duct is formed by two main trunks nearly of equal size\r\nwhich issue from the liver, one from the right and one from the left\r\nlobe. The hepatic duct passes downward and to the right from one to two\r\ninches where it is joined at an acute angle with the cystic duct.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Gall Bladder.=—The bladder is a reservoir for the bile. It is a\r\nconical or pear-shaped sack, lying on the under surface of the right\r\nlobe of the liver. It is about four inches in length, one inch in depth\r\nand holds from eight to ten drams.\r\n\r\nThe cystic duct is about an inch and a half in length, and passes\r\nobliquely downward to the left from the neck of the gall bladder, and\r\njoins the hepatic duct.\r\n\r\nThe common bile duct (ductus communis choledochous) is the common\r\nexcretory duct of the liver and the gall bladder, and is formed by\r\nthe union of the cystic and hepatic ducts. It descends to the middle\r\nportion of the duodenum, where it unites with the pancreatic duct, the\r\ntwo passing obliquely through the wall of the descending portion of the\r\nduodenum. The tissues of the liver are nourished by the blood from the\r\nhepatic arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Pancreas.=—The pancreas (the sweet bread) is a gland similar in\r\nstructure to the salivary glands; is about seven inches long, of a\r\ngrayish white color; its weight varies from two to six ounces. It is\r\nsituated behind the stomach, and it secretes the pancreatic juice. It\r\nextends to the right in a part of the epigastric space. The tail lies\r\nabove the left kidney, and is in contact with the lower end of the\r\nspleen and in the left hypochondriac region; the body lies behind the\r\nstomach and transverse colon and in front of the great aorta, portal\r\nvein and inferior vena cava. The arteries nourishing it are the large\r\nand small pancreatic, which are branches of the splenic artery.\r\n\r\nThe pancreatic duct is the principal excretory duct of the pancreas. It\r\nextends transversely from the left to the right through the substance\r\nof the pancreas.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the body of the pancreas, it unites with the common bile\r\nduct of the liver where it empties into the duodenum (first section of\r\nthe small intestines after leaving the stomach).\r\n\r\nThe pancreatic duct carries pancreatic juice (a digestive fluid) from\r\nthe pancreas to the duodenum.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Spleen.=—The spleen belongs to that class of bodies known as\r\nductless glands and has no excretory duct; is oblong, flattened,\r\nsoft, very brittle, very vascular, of a very dark bluish red color; is\r\nsituated in the left hypochondriac region behind and to the left of the\r\nstomach; is five inches long, three inches wide and two inches thick\r\nand weighs about seven ounces. The vessels which nourish it are the\r\nsplenic artery and splenic vein. Function. It is supposed to furnish\r\nblood corpuscles.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 26—The abdominal aorta and its branches.\r\n   (Gray)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Kidneys.=—The kidneys are large glands, two in number and are\r\nsituated from five to six inches apart or about three inches on either\r\nside of the median line in the right and left lumbar regions.\r\n\r\nThe upper extremity of the kidneys lies on the level of the twelfth\r\ndorsal vertebra and the lower extremity on the level of the third\r\nlumbar vertebra. Each kidney is four and one-half inches in length, two\r\nto two and one-half inches in breadth, a little more than one inch in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the kidney in the adult male is from four and one-half to\r\nsix ounces each. In the adult female the weight would be from four to\r\nfive and one-half ounces.\r\n\r\nTheir function is to separate from the blood certain waste products\r\nand an excess of water, the combination of which we know as urine.\r\nThe principal products excreted by the kidneys from the blood along\r\nwith water are ammonia and urea. The blood is taken to the kidneys\r\nby the renal arteries and the renal veins carry it back to the blood\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nThe urine is then taken from the kidneys by the ureters and conveyed to\r\nthe urinary bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Ureters.=—The ureters are cylindrical tubes about sixteen inches\r\nin length and of diameter of a goose-quill.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Suprarenal Capsules.=—The suprarenal capsules belong to that\r\nclass of bodies known as ductless glands and are two small flattened\r\nbodies of yellowish color, situated at the back of the abdomen, behind\r\nthe peritoneum (the covering for all of the abdominal organs), and\r\nimmediately above and in front of the upper end of each kidney. The\r\nname is derived from the position it occupies in relation to the\r\nkidney, supra meaning above, and renal pertaining to the kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe functions are as yet unknown. The suprarenal arteries furnish\r\nnourishment for the suprarenal capsules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Pelvic Cavity.=—The pelvic cavity is that portion of the abdomen\r\nsituated between the ilium and pubic bones, or in other words the\r\nextreme lowest portion of the abdominal cavity. The organs located\r\nwithin this cavity are the bladder in the male and the bladder and the\r\nuterus (womb) in the female.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Bladder.=—The urinary bladder is a reservoir for the urine,\r\nsituated in the pelvic cavity behind the pubic bone. In life it is\r\nsupplied with blood by the anterior branches of the internal iliac\r\narteries accompanied by the internal iliac veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Uterus.=—The uterus is the organ of gestation, receiving the\r\nfecundated ovum into its cavity, retaining it, and supporting it during\r\nthe development of the foetus, and becoming the principal agent in its\r\nexpulsion at the time of parturition (delivery). It is nourished in\r\nlife by branches of the internal iliac artery, which is accompanied by\r\nthe iliac vein.\r\n\r\nThe uterus is situated in the pelvic cavity between the rectum and the\r\nbladder, and is held in position by the lateral and round ligaments on\r\neach side. The uterus is about 3 inches in length, 2 inches in breadth\r\nand weighs from one to two ounces. It is composed of three coats,\r\nexternal serous, middle muscular, and internal mucous.\r\n\r\nThe serous coat, derived from the peritoneum, is thin and vascular.\r\n\r\nThe muscular coat is the chief coat, it is dense, firm, of a grayish\r\ncolor and cuts like cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe mucous coat is thin, smooth and closely adherent to the muscular\r\ncoat. It is highly vascular.\r\n\r\nThe blood supply to the uterus is the uterine arteries which are the\r\nposterior branches of the internal iliac arteries, and the ovarian\r\narteries which are branches of the aorta. These break up in capillaries\r\nand form a fine network plexus in the coats of the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe veins are of large size and are the uterine which empty into the\r\ninternal iliac veins and the ovarian veins. On the right side the\r\novarian vein empties into the ascending vena cava, and on the left side\r\ninto the renal vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Prostate.=—The prostate gland is a pale, firm glandular body, which\r\nsurrounds the neck of the bladder in the male. Its shape and size\r\nresembles a horse chestnut. It weighs from one-half to one ounce and\r\nmeasures one and one-half inches across and three quarters of an inch\r\ndeep. Its structure is inclosed by a firm thin fibrous capsule. Its\r\nsubstance is of a pale reddish grey color and is composed of glandular\r\nsubstance and muscular tissue.\r\n\r\nThe arteries that supply the prostate are derived from the internal\r\npubic, a branch of the internal iliac.\r\n\r\nThe veins form a plexus around the gland and communicate with veins\r\nwhich empty into the internal iliac veins. Its function is to secrete\r\nan opaque fluid.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 27—The Peritoneum. (Gray)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Peritoneum.=—During life and in the uncut corpse the peritoneal\r\ncavity is air-tight. It is not a real cavity, as muscular tension and\r\natmospheric pressure permit no vacant space to form. When the surgeon\r\nor embalmer opens the abdomen, the peritoneal cavity is at that moment\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe peritoneum is the largest serous membrane in the body. In the male\r\nit is a closed sac, a part of which is applied against the abdominal\r\nsides, while the remainder is reflected over the contained viscera. In\r\nthe female it is not a closed sac, since the free extremities of the\r\nfallopian tubes open directly into the peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\n_The parietal peritoneum_ is that portion applied against the abdominal\r\nsides.\r\n\r\n_The visceral peritoneum_ is that portion reflected over the viscera.\r\n\r\nThe peritoneum consists of two sacs.\r\n\r\n_The greater sac_ lines the greater part of the abdominal cavity as\r\nalmost all of the viscera are covered by it.\r\n\r\n_The lesser sac_ is placed behind the stomach. These two sacs\r\ncommunicate with each other by a narrow orifice called the _Foramen of\r\nWinslow_.\r\n\r\nThe peritoneum, as it covers different organs or sets of organs,\r\nreceives special names.\r\n\r\n_The lesser omentum_ consists of two layers, these split to envelope\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\n_The greater omentum_ consists of four layers. Two of these layers\r\nextend from the stomach and together with two other layers of the same\r\nstructure which envelope the transverse colon, form an apron for the\r\nintestines.\r\n\r\n_The mesentery_ consists of two layers which invests the small\r\nintestines. Between the two layers of the mesentery we find the\r\nblood vessels, nerves, lacteals, and glands, leading to and from the\r\nintestines. The mesentery is fan shaped, and is attached to the second\r\nlumbar vertebra. The length of the mesentery fan is about eight inches\r\nfrom commencement to termination at intestine. It extends the whole\r\nlength of the intestines, which is about twenty feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE VASCULAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Vascular System.=—The vascular system is composed of the organs\r\nimmediately concerned in the circulation throughout the body of the\r\nfluids which convey to the tissues the nutritive substances and oxygen\r\nnecessary for their metabolism and carry from them to the excretory\r\norgans the waste products formed during metabolism.\r\n\r\nThe system is usually regarded as being composed of two portions, the\r\none consists of organs in which circulate the red fluid which we term\r\nblood, and called the _blood vascular system_, while the organs of the\r\nother contain a colorless or white fluid known as lymph or chyle, and\r\nis known as the lymphatic circulation.\r\n\r\n                                                           { arteries\r\n                                           { Blood vessels { capillaries\r\n  The vascular { The blood vascular system {               { veins\r\n  system       {                           { Heart\r\n               { The lymphatic circulation\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Blood Vascular System.=—A knowledge of the general features of\r\nthe circulatory system are essential to the undertaker and the embalmer\r\nas a means of enabling him not only to perform the ordinary operations\r\nand duties of his profession intelligently, but to equip him with the\r\nknowledge necessary to meet the exceptional conditions which sometimes\r\narise.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing appreciation of the fact, also, that thoroughness\r\nin the practice of embalming is worth striving after. Many cases\r\nof embalming, no doubt, require a minimum amount of attention,\r\nparticularly where the body is to be kept but a short time. Where\r\npreservation for longer periods is required, as for transportation,\r\nor where disease and accident have interfered seriously with the\r\ncirculation, a more exact knowledge is evidently desirable.\r\n\r\nThe blood vascular system comprises the heart, which is the central\r\norgan of the whole system, and all the blood vessels. This system, with\r\nits arteries and veins, permeates the whole body and becomes divided\r\nand subdivided at its outer portion into vessels constantly decreasing\r\nin size, until those extremely minute vessels, the capillaries, are\r\nreached. All the tissues of the body are very rich in these, so that\r\nall portions of the body are supplied with blood, which is essential\r\nfor the nourishment and rebuilding of the tissues. The large vessels\r\nwhich convey blood from the heart are termed arteries, while the\r\nvessels which convey the blood back to the heart are termed veins.\r\n\r\nFor one to properly embalm the human body, it is necessary to\r\nunderstand the way the fluid will circulate through the body, and the\r\nonly way we can do this is to study the circulation of the blood as it\r\nwould occur in life.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the description of the blood vascular system, it has been\r\ndivided into six subdivisions as follows:\r\n\r\n  (1) Systemic.\r\n  (2) Pulmonary.\r\n  (3) Coronary.\r\n  (4) Portal.\r\n  (5) Foetal.\r\n  (6) Collateral.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Systemic Circulation.=—The systemic circulation is called the\r\ngreater circulation of the body. The course of the blood is from the\r\nleft ventricle of the heart through the aortic semi-lunar valve to the\r\ngreat aorta and its branches which end in capillaries in the tissues\r\nof the body then through the veins the terminal trunks of which end\r\nin the right auricle of the heart. So the systemic circulation is the\r\ncirculation of the blood from the left ventricle of the heart to the\r\nright auricle of the heart and this circulation has the important\r\nfunction of carrying oxygen to the tissues to nourish them, and of\r\ncarrying carbonic acid gas back to the heart which is a waste product\r\nof the tissues.\r\n\r\nThe systemic circulation is divided for the sake of convenience into\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n  (1) The arterial system.\r\n  (2) Capillary.\r\n  (3) The venous system.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Arterial System.=—The blood leaving the heart passes from the\r\nleft ventricle through the aortic semi-lunar valve, into the ascending\r\naorta. Here the two coronary arteries come off which go to supply\r\nthe muscular tissues of the heart. The ascending aorta passes into\r\nthe arch of the aorta. Here are given off the innominate artery to\r\nthe right and the common carotid and the subclavian to the left. The\r\ninnominate is only about an inch or two in length, and divides into the\r\nright common carotid and the right subclavian arteries. On each side\r\nthe subclavian passes down beneath the clavical bone and enters the\r\naxillary space where it is known as the axillary artery. After leaving\r\nthe axillary space, the artery passes down the arm and is known as the\r\nbrachial artery. About one inch below the bend of the elbow the artery\r\ndivides into two branches, known as the radial and ulnar. The radial\r\ngoes to the thumb side of the hand, and the ulnar to the little finger\r\nside of the hand. The ulnar artery and a branch of the radial form\r\nthe palmar arch, which gives off the branches to the fingers. Coming\r\noff the brachial are the deep brachial arteries and the anastomotica\r\nmagna arteries which anastomose and give collateral circulation to the\r\nforearm, by means of the recurrent radial and ulnar arteries.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 28—The arch of the aorta and its branches.\r\n   (Gray)]\r\n\r\nThe common carotid arteries pass up each side of the neck to a point\r\nopposite the Adam's apple, where they, divide into the external\r\ncarotid, which supplies the muscular tissue of the face, and the\r\ninternal carotid artery, which goes up through the skull and helps to\r\nform the circle of Willis.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral arteries come off the subclavian arteries on either side\r\nand pass upward, winding through the foramen of the vertebrae, until\r\nfinally arriving inside the cranial cavity, unite to form one artery\r\ncalled the basilar, which helps to form the circle of Willis.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 29—The internal carotid and vertebral\r\n   arteries. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nThe circle of Willis is situated at the base of the brain and gives off\r\nto the front the two anterior cerebral arteries, to the sides the two\r\nmiddle cerebral arteries, and to the back the two posterior cerebral\r\narteries. The two anterior cerebral arteries are connected by the\r\nanterior communicating branch, and the middle cerebral artery and the\r\nposterior cerebral arteries on each side are connected by the posterior\r\ncommunicating branches. The cerebral arteries terminate in the piamater\r\nas a dense capillary network, and from there supply the substance of\r\nthe brain with nutrition.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 30—The circle of Willis. (Spalteholz)]\r\n\r\nThe external carotid artery supplies the muscular tissues of the face.\r\nThe external carotid artery arises from the common carotid artery at\r\nabout the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage—a level\r\nwhich corresponds with the body of the fourth cervicle vertebra. Thence\r\nit is directed upward and slightly backward towards the angle of the\r\njaw, where it enters the substance of the parotid gland and continues\r\nupward in that structure to just below the root of the zygoma. Here\r\nit gives rise to a large branch, the internal maxillary, and is\r\nthen continued upward over the root of the zygoma upon the side of\r\nthe skull, this terminal portion of it being termed the superficial\r\ntemporal artery. The branches of the external carotid artery from below\r\nupward are (1) the ascending pharyngeal, (2) the superior thyroid, (3)\r\nthe lingual, (4) the occipital, (5) the facial or external maxillary,\r\n(6) the posterior auricular, (7) the internal maxillary, (8) the\r\nsuperficial temporal.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 31—The arteries of the face and scalp.\r\n   (Gray) FIG. 32—The external carotid and its branches. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nThe arch of the aorta now continues into the thoracic aorta, so called\r\nwhile it is in the thoracic cavity, and after it has passed through\r\nthe diaphragm becomes the abdominal aorta. At a point opposite the\r\numbilicus or navel the abdominal aorta divides into the two common\r\niliac arteries. Each common iliac artery divides into an internal iliac\r\nartery, which supplies the organs of the pelvic cavity, and an external\r\niliac artery, which passes beneath Poupart's ligament. As the artery\r\npasses down the leg it is known as the femoral artery, until it passes\r\ninto the popliteal space, where it is called the popliteal artery.\r\nAbout one inch below the popliteal space the artery divides into the\r\nanterior tibial artery, which runs on a straight line down the front\r\nand outside of the leg to a point between the big toe and the one next\r\nto it, and the posterior tibial artery which passes down the back part\r\nof the foreleg between the inside ankle and the heel. The peroneal,\r\na branch of the posterior tibial, passes down the foreleg between the\r\noutside ankle and the heel. The anterior tibial artery, as it passes\r\nthrough the instep is known as the large dorsal artery and further on\r\nis known as the small dorsal artery. In the foot is the plantar arch,\r\nformed by branches of the posterior and anterior tibial arteries, which\r\nsend out branches to each toe.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 33—The anterior tibial artery. (Gray) FIG.\r\n   34—The popliteal, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries.\r\n   (Gray)]\r\n\r\nComing off the femoral are the deep femoral and the anastomotica\r\nmagna arteries, which anastomose and form collateral circulation to\r\nthe foreleg by means of the recurrent anterior and posterior tibial\r\narteries.\r\n\r\nComing off the subclavian arteries are the superior and inferior\r\nmammary arteries, which pass down over the chest wall, anastomose and\r\ngive collateral circulation to the lower extremities by means of the\r\nsuperior and inferior epigastric arteries, branches of the external\r\niliac and femoral arteries.\r\n\r\nThe thoracic aorta gives off the intercostal arteries, which supply\r\nthe ribs, the bronchials which supply the lungs, the esophageal\r\nwhich supplies the esophagus, and the pericardiac which supplies the\r\npericardium.\r\n\r\nThe abdominal aorta gives off in rotation the coeliac axis, which\r\nas a hub in a wheel gives off three spokes, the gastric artery to\r\nthe stomach, the hepatic to the liver, and the splenic artery to the\r\nspleen. The next branch is the phrenic, which supplies the diaphragm,\r\nthen the suprarenal artery, two or more in number coming off of both\r\nthe aorta and the renal arteries. The suprarenal arteries supply the\r\nsuprarenal capsules. The next branch is the superior mesenteric artery,\r\nwhich supplies the small intestines; the next branch is the renal\r\narteries, which supply the kidneys; the next branch is the spermatic\r\nor the ovarian arteries, which supply the testes in the male or the\r\novaries in the female; the inferior mesenteric artery, which supplies\r\nthe large intestines. Also coming off the aorta at regular intervals\r\nare the lumbar arteries, which supply the side walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Capillary Circulation.=—The capillaries are very minute blood\r\nvessels, forming a network between the terminating arteries and the\r\ncommencing veins.\r\n\r\nThey derive their name from the word capillus (hair). They vary in size\r\nfrom 1-3500 to 1-3000 of an inch, the largest capillaries being those\r\nof the skin. These little vessels are so thickly distributed throughout\r\nmost of the tissues of the body as to make it impossible to insert a\r\ncambric needle in the flesh without pricking scores of them.\r\n\r\nWhen we embalm a body the object should be to introduce a sufficient\r\namount of fluid through the arterial system so that these tiny\r\ncapillaries will be filled. These little vessels are so minute and\r\nthe walls are so thin that the fluid is immediately taken up into the\r\ntissues. If every tissue of the body can be supplied with fluid by\r\nmeans of the capillaries, we would have the ideal, the body would be\r\nperfectly embalmed. Let us then not only be arterial embalmers, but,\r\nbetter still, let us be capillary and tissue embalmers.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 35—Capillaries a, cells; b, nuclei.\r\n   (Gray)]\r\n\r\nCapillaries have one wall, which is the continuation of the inner wall\r\nof the artery, thus making the capillary so thin that fluid finds its\r\nway easily through it into the surrounding tissues.\r\n\r\nSome parts of the body are more vascular than others and some\r\ntissues of the body, such as the cornea of the eye, the epidermis,\r\ncartilage, the substance of the brain, etc., are entirely destitute of\r\ncapillaries.\r\n\r\nThe combined area of all the capillaries of the body is many times\r\ngreater than the combined area of the trunk vessels. If this were\r\nnot so, the high pressure on the arterial system would break the thin\r\ncapillary walls and also the greater area allows the blood to circulate\r\nmore slowly which gives time for the liberation of oxygen to the\r\ntissues and for the absorption of carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Venous System.=—The veins, like the arteries, are tubular vessels,\r\ntheir function being to receive the blood from the capillaries and\r\nconvey it to the auricles of the heart. There are two classes of veins,\r\n=systemic= and =pulmonic=.\r\n\r\nThe systemic veins receive the impure or carbonized blood from the\r\ncapillaries and convey it to the right auricle of the heart.\r\n\r\nThe pulmonic veins receive the pure oxygenized blood from the lungs and\r\nconvey it to the left auricle of the heart. The pulmonic veins will be\r\ntaken up and discussed later under the pulmonary circulation.\r\n\r\n_Systemic veins_ are divided into superficial and deep veins and\r\nsinuses.\r\n\r\n_The superficial veins_ are found between the layers of the superficial\r\nfascia, just beneath the skin, and communicate with the deep veins by\r\nbranches which pierce the fascia.\r\n\r\n_The deep veins_ are found deeper down, between the muscles, and are\r\nsurrounded by the deep fascia.\r\n\r\nThe smaller arteries, such as the radial, brachial, posterior and\r\nanterior tibial, and the peroneal arteries, are each accompanied by two\r\nveins, one on each side of the artery, which are called venae comites\r\n(accompanying veins). The larger arteries, such as the common carotid,\r\nthe femoral and the iliac, are accompanied by only one vein.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 36—Superficial veins of the head and neck.\r\n   (Gray)]\r\n\r\nVeins arise from the capillaries, or, rather, from the minute capillary\r\nplexus, formed by a massing or blending of the tiny venules. These\r\nsmall vessels unite to form larger trunks, and as they continue\r\ntoward the heart increase in size until they finally unite to form the\r\nascending and descending venae cavae.\r\n\r\n_The Sinuses._—The cerebral veins are small vessels that arise from\r\nthe capillaries of the brain, and terminate in the sinuses of the dura\r\nmater. There are many sinuses in the cranial cavity, and differ from\r\nthe vein, in that the walls are thinner, having only two walls while\r\nthe veins have three, and they do not have valves. The outer walls of\r\nthe sinuses of the brain are formed by a division of the dura mater,\r\nwhile the inner wall is the continuation of the inner wall of the vein.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 37—The internal long saphenous vein.\r\n   (Gray)]\r\n\r\nThey are of little interest to embalmers, except for the fact that when\r\nthe brain is injected by any of the so-called needle processes, the\r\nfluid is quickly conveyed through these vessels to the tissues of the\r\nbrain, and that organ is thoroughly preserved.\r\n\r\nThe vessels starting at the foot are the anterior and posterior tibial\r\nveins, which unite just below the knee to form the popliteal vein, in\r\nthe popliteal space. Another vein starts from the foot and runs into\r\nthe popliteal vein called the external short saphenous. Starting also\r\nat the foot and running into the posterior tibial vein is the peroneal\r\nvein.\r\n\r\nThe popliteal vein after leaving the popliteal space is known as the\r\nfemoral vein as it passes up the leg, to Poupart's ligament. Another\r\nvein, the internal long saphenous, starts at the foot, and runs into\r\nthe femoral vein about an inch below Poupart's ligament. After passing\r\nbeneath Poupart's ligament the vessel is called the external iliac.\r\nComing from the organs of the pelvic cavity is the internal iliac,\r\nwhich joins with the external iliac vein to form the common iliac vein.\r\nThe right and left iliac veins join opposite the umbilicus to form the\r\nascending vena cava. The ascending vena cava passes upward to the right\r\nof the vertebral column through the diaphragm and enters the right\r\nauricle of the heart by means of the eustachian valve.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 38—The superficial veins of the arm.\r\n   (Gray)]\r\n\r\nIn the forearm are the radial veins on the thumb side of the hand,\r\nthe ulnar veins on the little finger side of the hand, and the median\r\nvein just between the radial and ulnar veins. The median vein divides\r\ninto the median cephalic vein and the median basilic. The median\r\ncephalic vein unites with the radial vein to form the cephalic vein,\r\nwhich runs up the back part of the arm and finally empties into the\r\nsubclavian vein. The median basilic unites with the ulnar vein to form\r\nthe basilic, which runs up the inner part of the arm between the biceps\r\nand triceps muscles. The deep brachial veins or the vena comites,\r\ntwo in number, which follow the brachial artery, run into the basilic\r\nvein. When the basilic vein arrives at the axillary space it takes on\r\nthe name of the axillary vein, and as the vessel passes beneath the\r\nsubclavian bone, it becomes the subclavian vein. The right and left\r\nsubclavian veins with the right and left internal jugular veins from\r\neach side of the head form the right and left innominate veins, which\r\nunite to form the descending vena cava, which runs into the right\r\nauricle of the heart.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 39—Vertical section of the skull, showing\r\n   the sinuses of the dura mater. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nStarting at the head, the superior longitudinal sinus begins at the\r\nfore part of the brain and runs backward between the two hemispheres of\r\nthe brain and empties into the wine press or Torcular herophili. The\r\ninferior longitudinal sinus begins at the fore part of the brain, but\r\nrung deeper down in the pia mater between the two hemispheres of the\r\nbrain, terminates in the straight sinus which empties into the wine\r\npress. Beginning at the base of the cerebellum are the two occipital\r\nsinuses which run together and terminate in the wine press. After all\r\nthe blood has been gathered together in the wine press, it leaves by\r\nmeans of the right and left lateral sinuses which pass down as far as\r\nthe jugular foramen. Beginning at the base of the brain in front are\r\nthe right and left cavernosus sinuses, which run into the inferior\r\npetrosal sinuses, which pass down as far as the jugular foramen, where\r\nthey join the lateral sinuses to form the right and left internal\r\njugular vein. The superior petrosal sinus is between the lateral sinus\r\nand the cavernosus sinus uniting them. Joining the right and left\r\ncavernosus sinuses is the circular sinus and joining the right and left\r\ninferior petrosal sinuses is the transverse sinus. The right and left\r\ninternal jugular veins pass down through the jugular foramens and down\r\nthe neck to where they with the right and left subclavian veins form\r\nthe right and left innominate veins. The right and left innominate\r\nveins unite to form the descending vena cava which empties into the\r\nright auricle of the heart.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 40—The sinuses at the base of the skull.\r\n   (Gray)]\r\n\r\nBeginning in the tissues of the heart are the coronary veins, which\r\nterminate in the coronary sinus and then into the right auricle of the\r\nheart through the coronary valves.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 41—The azygos system and venae cavae with\r\n   branches. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nThe azygos system consists of the major azygos vein, which starts at\r\nthe right external iliac vein and empties into the descending vena\r\ncava; the minor azygos vein which starts at the left external iliac\r\nvein and empties into the major azygos vein back of the heart; and\r\nthe tertiary azygos vein, which starts at the left subclavian vein and\r\nempties into the minor azygos vein. The azygos veins collect all the\r\nblood from the side walls of the body and form a perfect collateral\r\ncirculation between the superior and inferior caval systems, and\r\nthoroughly equalizes the blood pressure all over the body. The major\r\nazygos vein receives the following: the right intercostal veins,\r\nexcepting the first; the azygos minor; the right bronchial vein; the\r\nesophageal vein; the pericardiac; and the posterior mediastinal veins.\r\nThe minor azygos vein receives the following: the tertiary azygos\r\nvein; the lower five left intercostal veins; the small left mediastinal\r\nveins; the lower left esophageal veins. The tertiary azygos receives\r\nthe following: the fifth, sixth and sometimes the seventh intercostal\r\nveins; the lower end of the lower left superior intercostal vein; and\r\nthe left bronchial vein. The inferior vena cava receives the following\r\nveins: the lumbar veins; the hepatic veins; the phrenic veins; the\r\nrenal veins; the right suprarenal vein; the right spermatic or ovarian\r\nvein. The left spermatic or ovarian vein and the left suprarenal vein\r\nempty into the left renal vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Pulmonary Circulation.=—This is the circulation existing between\r\nthe right ventricle of the heart through the lungs back to the left\r\nauricle of the heart.\r\n\r\nThe pulmonary artery takes its origin from the summit of the right\r\nventricle. It is about two inches in length, and is directed upward,\r\nbackward and slightly towards the left, and beneath the arch of the\r\naorta it divides into the right and left pulmonary arteries. These end\r\nin a system of capillaries in between the air cells of the lungs, where\r\ncarbon dioxide is thrown off and oxygen taken on.\r\n\r\nThe pulmonary veins are four in number, two passing from the root of\r\neach lung to the posterior surface of the left auricle of the heart.\r\nEach vein is formed at the root of the lung by the union of a number\r\nof smaller vessels which take origin ultimately from the capillary net\r\nwork formed from the branches of the pulmonary artery, and to a certain\r\nextent from that formed by the bronchial arteries. Each pulmonary vein\r\nis about six inches in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Coronary Circulation.=—The heart receives its blood supply through\r\nthe two coronary arteries which arise from the aorta immediately above\r\nits origin, the return flow being by the coronary veins which open into\r\nthe right auricle of the heart by the coronary sinus. The branches of\r\nthe coronary arteries upon the surface of the heart are, as a rule,\r\nall end arteries; that is, arteries which form no direct anastomosis\r\nwith their neighbors. Practically no blood can be carried directly,\r\ntherefore, by the left coronary artery into the territory supplied by\r\nthe right one, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe coronary sinus is a short venous trunk a little over an inch\r\nin length, which occupies the right half of that portion of the\r\nauriclo-ventricular groove which lies between the left auricle and\r\nventricle. At the right end it opens into the right auricle, its\r\norifice being guarded by the Thebesian valve.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 42—A front view of the heart showing\r\n   coronary arteries. (Spalteholz)]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 43—A back view of the heart showing\r\n   the coronary sinus, and vessels entering and leaving.\r\n   (Spalteholz)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Portal Circulation.=—This circulation is of little or no value to\r\nthe embalmer, as no part of it is directly required to supply any of\r\nthe tissues with embalming fluid.\r\n\r\nThe portal circulation is formed by the superior mesenteric vein\r\nand the splenic vein uniting to form the portal vein. The inferior\r\nmesenteric vein runs into the splenic vein; the gastric and cystic\r\nveins run into the portal veins. The portal vein ends in capillaries\r\nin the liver, where certain important changes take place, namely, the\r\ntaking out of the bile.\r\n\r\nThe portal vein and its tributaries are unlike the veins in the general\r\ncirculation, as there are no valves. Their function in life is to\r\ngather up food or nutrition for the blood, and to the embalmer is of no\r\nspecial importance, only to know how this circulation is made up. The\r\nvessels that convey blood to the liver in life and the fluid in death\r\nare discussed under the liver.\r\n\r\nAfter death, about one-fourth of the blood of the body is to be found\r\nin the portal system. This blood can in no way be removed, and this is\r\none of the reasons why the embalmer is not able to draw more blood than\r\nhe does.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Foetal Circulation.=—The foetal circulation is that circulation\r\nexisting between mother and unborn child.\r\n\r\n_The placenta_ constitutes, from the third month of intra uterine\r\nlife, the nutritive and respiratory organ of the foetus. The placenta\r\nconsists of a maternal portion and a foetal portion. _The maternal\r\nportion_ is that portion of the placenta next to the uterine wall\r\nof the mother. In this are intervillus blood spaces, which may be\r\nregarded as derivations from the eroded maternal blood vessels. In\r\nthe non-pregnant state the uterus is supplied with branches from the\r\ninternal iliac artery, which end in capillaries in the wall of the\r\nuterus. In the pregnant state the numerous branches of the arteries\r\nsupplying the uterus do not end as capillaries, but pierce the basal\r\nplate of the placenta, where the arterial vessels lose their muscular\r\ncoat and open directly into the intervillus or intraplacental blood\r\nspaces. Maternal capillaries are wanting within the placenta, since\r\nthey become early replaced by the intervillus spaces. The maternal\r\nblood is carried away from these spaces by wide venous channels,\r\nforming networks from which proceed the larger venous trunks.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 44—Plan of the foetal circulation. (Gray)]\r\n\r\n_The foetal portion_ of the placenta is that portion next to the child.\r\nHere end the terminal loops of the foetal blood vessels, the blood\r\nbeing conveyed to and from the placenta along the umbilical cord, by\r\nthe umbilical arteries and vein. Although coming into close relation,\r\nthe blood streams of the mother and of the child never actually\r\nmingle, because of the delicate septum which intervenes. The delicate\r\nseptum, however, allows the free interchange of gases necessary for\r\nthe respiratory function as well as the passage of nutritive substances\r\ninto the foetal circulation.\r\n\r\n_The umbilical cord_ connects the body of the foetus with the placenta,\r\nand conveys the foetal blood to and from the placenta to the child.\r\nThis blood is carried by means of two umbilical arteries and one\r\numbilical vein.\r\n\r\nThe umbilical vein originates by means of capillaries in the placenta,\r\ntraverses the cord and enters the body of the child at the umbilicus.\r\nThe umbilical vein now enters the substance of the liver and passes\r\nfrom that organ to the ascending vena cava by means of the ductus\r\nvenosus. The blood now enters the right auricle of the heart and the\r\neustachian valve is so placed that this blood is thrown directly into\r\nthe left auricle of the heart, from there into the left ventricle, and\r\nout into the aorta to find itself in the general circulation of the\r\nchild. The blood coming from the upper extremities of the child finds\r\nits way into the right auricle of the heart by means of the descending\r\nvena cava, thence into the right ventricle, and out into the pulmonary\r\nartery. This artery after birth will lead the blood to the lungs, but\r\nbefore birth, in as much as the lungs are not functioning, the lungs\r\ncan not accommodate this amount of blood, so it passes directly into\r\nthe arch of the aorta by means of the ductus arteriosus, and thence\r\ninto the general circulation. The umbilical or hypogastric arteries\r\nleave the internal iliacs, pass one on each side of the bladder to\r\nthe umbilicus, and thence down the cord to the placenta, end there in\r\ncapillaries, where the blood is now purified, and nourished for its\r\nreturn flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Collateral Circulation.=—By collateral circulation is meant the\r\nanastomoses of arteries, or veins through a side branch. There are\r\nthree great arterial collateral circulations in the body. One is in\r\nthe arm, the deep brachial artery, and the anastomotica magna, coming\r\noff of the brachial artery and anastomosing with the recurrent radial\r\nand ulnar artery. One is in the leg, the deep femoral artery, and the\r\nanastomotica magna coming off of the femoral artery and anastomosing\r\nwith the recurrent anterior and posterior tibial arteries. One over\r\nthe front part of the body, the superior and inferior mammary arteries\r\nbranches of the subclavian artery and anastomosing with the superior\r\nand inferior epigastric arteries, branches of the external iliac and\r\nfemoral arteries.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 45—Collateral anastomosis of veins\r\n   (Poirier and Charpy)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Lymphatic Circulation.=—The lymphatic system is a system of\r\nvessels which occurs abundantly in almost all portions of the body and\r\nconverge and anastomose to form two or more main trunks, which open\r\ninto the subclavian veins just before they are joined by the internal\r\njugular. The vessels contain a fluid termed lymph, usually colorless\r\nand containing numerous white blood corpuscles known as lymphocytes.\r\n\r\nIn those vessels which have their origin in the wall of the small\r\nintestines, the contained fluid has, especially during digestion, a\r\nmore or less milky appearance, owing to the lymphocytes being loaded\r\nwith particles of fat which they have taken up from the intestinal\r\ncontents. On this account, these vessels are usually spoken of as\r\nlacteals, although it must be recognized that they are merely portions\r\nof the general lymphatic system.\r\n\r\nIn certain respects the vessels of the system strongly resemble\r\nthe veins. They arise from a capillary network, their walls have a\r\nstructure closely resembling that of the veins, they are abundantly\r\nsupplied with valves, and it may be said that the fluid which they\r\ncontain flows from the tissues towards the subclavian veins. With\r\nthese similarities there are combined marked differences. One of the\r\nmost important of these consists in the fact that the capillaries of\r\nthe lymphatics are closed and do not communicate with any other set of\r\nvessels as the venous capillaries do with the arterial; and another\r\nimportant difference is to be found in the frequent occurrence upon\r\nthe lymphatic vessels of characteristic enlargements, the so-called\r\nlymphatic nodes or glands, quite different from anything occurring in\r\nconnection with the veins.\r\n\r\nThroughout the body spaces of varying size are found, containing a\r\nclear, more or less watery fluid, which are called lymph spaces. These\r\nspaces do not communicate with the capillaries of the lymphatics, but\r\nare in such close relationship with them that the fluid easily finds\r\nits way into the lymph capillaries by osmosis, absorption, lymphocytes\r\ngoing out into these spaces and returning filled with the lymph fluid.\r\n\r\nThe lymphatic capillaries, which are arranged in the form of networks\r\nof very different degrees of fineness and complexity, closely resemble\r\nin structure the blood capillaries, their walls consisting of a\r\nsingle layer of endothelial cells. They differ from those of the blood\r\nvascular system not only in their ultimate branches being closed, but\r\nalso in their general appearance. They are of greater caliber.\r\n\r\nThe lymph vessels, which issue from the capillary networks and convey\r\nthe lymph ultimately to the subclavian veins, have the arrangement\r\nclosely resembling that of the veins; the larger ones are usually\r\nsituated alongside and accompany the course of the blood vessels.\r\nJust as the veins unite to form larger trunks as they pass from the\r\ncapillaries toward their termination, so, too, the lymphatics, but the\r\nlymphatics present two peculiarities which distinguish them from the\r\nveins. They do not anastomose as abundantly as veins and there is not\r\nthe same proportional increase in the size of the lymphatic vessel. The\r\nleft trunk or thoracic duct is much larger than the right, beginning\r\nin the abdominal region and traversing the entire length of the thorax\r\nto reach its destination. It receives all the lymph returned from the\r\nlower limbs, the pelvic walls and viscera, the abdominal walls and\r\nviscera, the lower part of the right half and the whole of the left\r\nhalf of the thoracic viscera, the left side of the neck and head,\r\nand the left arm. The other trunk, the right lymphatic duct, is very\r\nshort and sometimes wanting. It receives the lymph from the upper part\r\nof the right side of the thoracic wall, from the right half of the\r\nthoracic viscera and the upper surface of the liver, the right side\r\nof the neck and head, and from the right arm. The structure of the\r\nlarger lymphatic vessels is similar to the veins, but, as a rule, their\r\nwalls are thinner than those of the veins of corresponding caliber and\r\ntheir valves are more numerous. The walls of the most robust trunks,\r\nparticularly those of the thoracic duct, consist of three coats. From\r\nwithin outward these are: (a) the intima, composed of the endothelial\r\nlining and the fibro-subendothelial layer; (b) the media, made up of\r\ninvoluntary muscle interspersed with fibro-elastic tissue; and (c) the\r\nadventitia, consisting of fibro-elastic tissue and longitudinal bundles\r\nof involuntary muscle.\r\n\r\nLymphatic nodes are scattered along the course of the lymphatic\r\nvessels, found in various regions of the body as elliptical flattened\r\nnodules of varying size. The embalmer will meet with these in the\r\naxillary and inguinal regions, or when he is raising the axillary or\r\nfemoral arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nEMBALMING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbalming\r\n\r\n\r\nThe central thought of the modern funeral director in the care of the\r\ndead and in all the arrangements of the funeral is to remove so far\r\nas may be all that is necessarily painful to those who must place out\r\nof sight the body through which the soul of the dear one has expressed\r\nitself, in all the ways that are prompted by affection. This does not\r\nseem to have been the case in the former days when the methods were in\r\nstriking contrast to those of today and were such as would intensify\r\nthe suffering of the living. Beginning with the arrangement of the\r\nbody in the room made cold by nature in winter or by the ice box in\r\nthe summer and ending by lowering the body into an unlined grave, each\r\ndetail seems to have been made with little thought of lessening the\r\npain caused by those things which necessarily have to be done. Perhaps\r\nthe central thought in the old days was the same as that which was\r\nthe comfort offered upon funeral occasions by a former local pastor\r\nwhich was “death is a horrible thing.” If this was not the controlling\r\nthought, it is certain that many details of former funeral customs\r\nwould be considered horrible today. Today the aim is to lighten the\r\nburden and to cheer the hearts of those who mourn.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of embalming in the seventies has been of untold\r\nbenefit in improving the environment of the dead prior to interment.\r\nRecollections of the use of the old ice box, the crude and cumbersome\r\ncooler, the ice water to be cared for and the thought of the chilled\r\nbody are not pleasant now, and were far from pleasant then to those\r\ninto whose homes death had entered in hot weather. In winter natural\r\ncold was depended upon, the body being placed in the coldest place\r\npossible. With the best of care the results were uncertain and far from\r\nsatisfactory. Modern embalming has changed all this. Its results are\r\nwith rare exceptions certain and satisfactory and the embalmed body may\r\nbe dressed and placed in a warm and comfortable room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMODES, SIGNS AND TESTS OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as surely as we are born, just so surely must we die, and just as\r\nit is the physician's duty to care for the living body, if possible to\r\nkeep it in a strong and healthful condition, so it is the embalmer's\r\nduty to care for the body after death, not so much for the body itself,\r\nbut from a sanitary standpoint, namely, to see that the body is well\r\ndisinfected and embalmed so that there will be absolutely no chance for\r\nthe spread of disease.\r\n\r\nAny one who is familiar with hospital work must know that all do not\r\ndie in the same way. For some it is the long lingering disease, chronic\r\nin form, which after a long and tedious course the thread of life is\r\nfinally broken, and we hardly know the instant at which the change was\r\ncompleted. For others, it is the short, acute attack, which snaps the\r\nlife away in a very instant, only after a very short duration. For some\r\nit is to die from accidental causes, while for others it is only the\r\npassing out from the period of old age. For some the mind may be active\r\nand the intellectual faculties useful up to the last moment, while for\r\nothers the contrary is all but too true.\r\n\r\nAlthough there may be many different kinds of disease infecting the\r\nhuman race, yet we find that death ultimately results from the stoppage\r\nof any one, or maybe, all three of the vital organs, namely the heart,\r\nbrain or lungs. Anything whatsoever which plays upon the body, to such\r\nan extent, as to affect the functions absolutely, of either the heart,\r\nbrain or lungs, will result in the death of that body. And since these\r\norgans are of such vital importance to us, and since the stoppage of\r\nany one of them will result in death, they have been termed the vital\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Modes of Death.=—There are, then, only three modes of death: syncope,\r\nor the stoppage of the heart; coma, or the failure of the brain to\r\nperform its functions; apnea, or the stoppage of the lungs.\r\n\r\n_Syncope._—For the heart to properly perform its function, namely\r\nthat of propelling the blood to all parts of the body, it must first\r\nbe properly nourished itself. If for any reason the heart does not\r\nget this proper nourishment, say the coronary arteries should become\r\nclogged, or a fatty infiltration, or a lack of red blood corpuscles, we\r\nwould have a condition in the body known as anemia.\r\n\r\nThe heart must also have a proper nerve supply from the brain, and if\r\nbecause of any disease, the vaso-motor or the vaso-constrictor fibers\r\nshould become affected, the heart would cease to contract and expand,\r\nand hence the complete stoppage of the heart. A condition of this kind\r\nis known as asthenia.\r\n\r\nBut whether it is death by anemia or asthenia, the state of suspended\r\nanimation, common to both these forms is expressed by the single\r\nterm—syncope.\r\n\r\n_Coma._—In cases of apoplexy, where we have the blood escaping from the\r\nruptured vessels, compressing the brain, we find death ensuing. Also in\r\naccidental cases such as fracture of the skull, the injury will often\r\ncause death. These are examples of coma, and can be explained in this\r\nway, viz.; the power of the brain becomes inactive either through the\r\nresult of an injury or a disease, and when this inactivity occurs the\r\nrespiratory apparatus subsides and the heart deprived of its normal\r\nstimulus through the vaso-motor and constrictor fibers, soon ceases to\r\nbeat, and death is the result.\r\n\r\n_Apnea_, _Asphyxia_.—If for any reason the supply of oxygen is cut off\r\nfrom the lungs, we will have the body dying the result of asphyxia or\r\napnea. The most common forms found of this mode of death are those of\r\nhanging, drowning or coal gas poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Signs of Impending Death.=—The signs of impending death are those\r\nconditions which exist on the body or the peculiar features of the\r\nbody which aid the physician in ascertaining the exact condition\r\nof the body. These signs assume many different forms and in no two\r\ninstances may they be found alike. They of course, are not positive in\r\nthemselves, but are sufficient to guide us in forming an opinion as to\r\nthe approach of death.\r\n\r\nOne of the first signs to be noticed is the coldness of the\r\nextremities. In this case the coldness begins at the extreme tips of\r\nthe fingers and toes and gradually extends toward the trunk. This,\r\nof course, is due to the gradual diminishing activity of the heart to\r\npropel the blood to the extremities.\r\n\r\nThe brain also fails to receive its proper blood supply and becomes\r\nweakened and we find the mind wandering. This wandering results in the\r\npatient going through movements representing the playing with flowers,\r\nor picking at the bed clothing. A further result of this weakness is\r\nthat the patient may have visions of angels and heaven.\r\n\r\nSpeech begins to grow thick, and a large lump of phlegm gathers in the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nThe hands now feel cold and clammy, and if they are raised they\r\ninstantly fall. One cannot detect the act of respiration, as the\r\nmovements of the thoracic walls are so slight as to be scarcely\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nThe heart loses its power to propel the blood and the stoppage of every\r\norgan in the body ensues.\r\n\r\nThe eyes become fixed with a staring look as though they were not\r\nfocused on anything directly. The eyes lose their lustre on account of\r\nthe lachrymal glands refusing to secrete.\r\n\r\nThe vital organs, the heart, brain and lungs come to a halt, and we\r\nfind the body passing from life to the great beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tests of Actual Death.=—From the large number of statistics that\r\nhave been gathered together for our purpose, we find that the time\r\nof greatest mortality is in the early morning hours between three and\r\nsix A. M., for it is between these hours that the body is in a perfect\r\nstate of relaxation, and at the lowest ebb of vitality.\r\n\r\nThe time of least mortality is between the hours of eleven and two P.\r\nM., as the body is in a relatively high state of vitality during these\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe tests of actual death can be placed in two classes, the common\r\ntests and the expert tests.\r\n\r\nThe common tests are those that have long been used by the\r\ninexperienced to ascertain the fact of death. They are not necessarily\r\nconclusive in themselves, but when all are taken together there can not\r\nbe much doubt.\r\n\r\n(a) _The Feather Test._—In this test a feather is held to the nostrils\r\nto observe whether it moves. The feather being so light, the slightest\r\nrespiration of the lung would be apt to move it.\r\n\r\n(b) _The Mirror Test._—In this test a mirror is held to the mouth\r\nand nostrils. If moisture collects on the mirror it is evident that\r\nrespiratory movements are going on. If there is an absence of moisture\r\nwe are quite safe in saying that the patient is dead.\r\n\r\n(c) _The Bandage Test._—In this test a bandage is placed around the arm\r\nand then twisted very tightly. If there is the slightest circulation\r\nexisting in the body the blood will accumulate back of the bandage in\r\nthe venous system and thus demonstrate the fact. There will also be no\r\nswelling or discoloration beyond the ligature.\r\n\r\n(d) By placing the ear to the chest over the heart, no sounds will be\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n(e) If the ear is applied over the lungs, no sounds will be heard.\r\n\r\n(f) If a cup of water is placed on the chest there will be no movement\r\nof rays or ripples on the surface.\r\n\r\n(g) If the skin is cut, no blood will flow, nor will the wound close.\r\n\r\n(h) If heat, say for instance a burning match be applied to the skin\r\nit will not blister, or if ammonia is hypodermically injected under\r\nthe skin there will be no redness, but rather the skin will turn to a\r\nyellowish color.\r\n\r\n(i) The living hand when held to the light shows pink through the inner\r\nedges of the fingers, but with the dead hand it shows opaqueness.\r\n\r\n(j) When a strong light is brought before the eye the pupil of the eye\r\nwill not dilate or contract.\r\n\r\n(2) The expert tests are those which a doctor or coroner might use to\r\nascertain the fact of death. These tests are made with the stethoscope\r\nand the ophthalmoscope.\r\n\r\n(a) By the use of the stethoscope the physician can hear the sounds of\r\nthe heart and if there is the slightest sound he can detect it. In the\r\nabsence of any sound the body is pronounced dead.\r\n\r\n(b) By the use of the ophthalmoscope the physician is enabled to look\r\ninto the pupil of the eye and if there is life he can see the blood\r\ncirculating through the tiny capillaries of the retina. If he does not\r\nsee this capillary circulation he is quite safe in saying the body is\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n(c) Another method consists in the hypodermic or intravenous injection\r\nof certain substances, and ascertaining whether these substances have\r\nbeen dispersed throughout the body. If they have, then a circulation\r\nexists and life continues, although the pulsation of the heart may\r\nnot be detected by auscultation. Among the substances recommended for\r\ninjection are fluorescin, sodium iodide, lithium iodide and potassium\r\nferro-cyanide. The injection of the small quantities as used will not\r\ncause death should the patient still be living.\r\n\r\nFluorescin is usually injected, one gramme dissolved with an equal\r\nweight of sodium carbonate in eight cubic centimeters of water, and\r\nthe whole quantity injected hypodermically. If the circulation is\r\npersisting, the skin and the mucous membranes after a very few minutes\r\nassume a greenish color; about twenty minutes after the injection,\r\nthe portion of the eye within the iris assumes a green color from\r\npenetration of the fluorescin into the vitreous and aqueous humors, and\r\nin the blood the fluorescin may be detected by the following method:\r\nOne or two threads of cotton are passed under the skin in the form of\r\na seton, and when saturated with blood are transferred to a test tube,\r\nand boiled with a little water. As the liquid clears the green color\r\nof the fluorescin becomes evident, if that substance has been absorbed\r\ninto the blood.\r\n\r\n(d) Another method for the distinction of real from apparent death\r\nconsists in picking up a fold of the skin and compressing it with a\r\npair of artery forceps. If the skin does not completely settle down,\r\nand if the fine furrows produced by the teeth of the forceps continue\r\nindefinitely, then death has occurred. Whereas, if the circulation\r\nis continuous, the fold and the marks of the forceps would disappear.\r\nMoreover, if death has occurred the portion of the skin compressed by\r\nthe forceps assumes a parchment-like appearance.\r\n\r\n(e) The electrical current affords a means of determining death. It\r\nis now known that the muscles, after cadaveric rigidity has set in, do\r\nnot respond to electric stimuli. The faradic current will cause, when\r\ndeath has occurred, muscular contractions until a short time before\r\npost-mortem rigidity occurs. The faradic stimulus is lost first and\r\nthe galvanic stimulus soon after. We may be enabled to approximate the\r\ntime at which death occurred, for, if we find any response to either\r\nthe faradic or the galvanic current, we know at once that post-mortem\r\nrigidity has not yet occurred.\r\n\r\nNo person should be buried as long as the muscles contract when\r\nstimulated by either the faradic or the galvanic current. If the\r\nelectrical test were always applied before a death certificate was\r\nsigned, there would be absolutely no possibility of a person being\r\nburied alive and the public would soon lose the morbid fear of such an\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Later and More Positive Signs.=—(a) After a few hours the blood\r\ngradually sinks to the dependent parts of the body giving a\r\nreddish-blue discoloration, known as post-mortem discoloration, or\r\ncadaveric lividity.\r\n\r\n(b) The eyes become sunken in the sockets, the eye balls become\r\nflattened, the cornea opaque and the pupil irregular in shape.\r\n\r\n(c) The eyelid loses its elasticity, and the white transparent color of\r\nthe conjunctiva is lost, often becoming black or gray.\r\n\r\n(d) Rigor mortis may or may not be present.\r\n\r\n(e) The body gradually cools to the temperature of the surrounding\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n(f) On opening an artery it is generally found to be empty after death.\r\n\r\n(g) The latest and most positive sign of all is putrefaction, and when\r\nthis is found to be present all other signs may be ignored.\r\n\r\n(h) Skin slip present on the body is only another manifestation of\r\nputrefaction, and also signifies that the body is dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nPREMATURE BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Premature Burial.=—In this enlightened age, with our knowledge of\r\nrespiration and the circulation of the blood, with our complete mastery\r\nof the phenomena of death with scientific tests, it is absolutely\r\nimpossible to have such a thing as a premature burial.\r\n\r\nNevertheless from the earliest times the fear of premature burial has\r\nbeen felt by many, and curious and strange methods have been adopted to\r\nprevent the possibility of individuals being consigned to their graves\r\nbefore life was extinct.\r\n\r\nTradition records many cases where, in spite of their precautions,\r\nsuch unfortunate actions have happened. It may be that tradition is\r\nan uncertain and erring guide. And yet underlying all tradition, as\r\nDieulafoy said, is a solid substratum of truth which the thoughtful\r\ninvestigator must take into consideration. The tale of the Cologne\r\ngoldsmith's wife, that survives in the legend of the neighing\r\nhorses, may be weird, bizarre, and from a scientific point of view,\r\ndemonstratively ludicrous, but its germ is to be found in the recorded\r\nfact that in times of epidemics, when the dying were huddled away\r\nwith the dead, mistakes did occur, and one or two were rectified by\r\nthe resurrection of the “dead.” In cases where burial took place in\r\ncommodious family vaults, the changes in the position of the coffin,\r\nproduced by atmospheric and other physical factors and were startlingly\r\ndisclosed when the vaults were opened to receive new bodies, doubtless\r\ngave an impetus to the belief in the comparative frequency of such\r\nmistakes. The medical man remembers that on occasions he has found\r\nit difficult, without applying some of the common and finer tests,\r\nto certify death in a patient dying of a lingering disease, but his\r\nknowledge forbids him believing that such difficulties as he may\r\nhave experienced in his own practice can ever have caused his fellow\r\npractitioner to make so grievous a mistake in a similar case. The\r\npublic has no such knowledge; it relies on the exceptional cases and\r\nglibly credits the statement—true enough in a limited sense that there\r\nis no certain proof of death. While it is certainly true that no single\r\nsign can be absolutely relied upon to prove that life is extinct,\r\nall practitioners will agree that several signs taken in combination\r\nand methodically applied are sufficiently accurate to obviate the\r\npossibility of mistake. Much has been made of the cataleptic condition\r\nand the probability of mistaking it for death, which has formed the\r\nbasis of one of Poe's narratives. As a matter of fact, catalepsy, of\r\nsuch a nature as to be confounded with _tota exitus_, is extremely\r\nrare—so rare that we doubt if any practitioner with a large experience\r\nof nervous conditions has met with more than one or two instances.\r\nFurther, even in such extremely rare conditions, the usual tests are\r\napplicable and to the trained medical man at least clearly prove the\r\nnature of the case. The stethoscope and the mirror held in front of\r\nthe patient's mouth are usually sufficient to demonstrate that the\r\npatient is alive and we should want more conclusive evidence than such\r\nas has been brought forward up to the present, to feel that cataleptic\r\npatients have been consigned to their coffins before life was totally\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nNewspaper writers delight in the fictitious and marvelous, and without\r\nany regard whatever to the scientific phase of the subject, frequent\r\nmention of cases of premature burial is to be found almost daily in the\r\npress of the country. But upon investigating these newspaper stories,\r\nit will be found that they have been either originated in the fertile\r\nbrain of some reporter or were merely published to consume space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGES IN THE BODY AFTER DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooling of the Body.=—The internal temperature of the healthy living\r\nbeing is about 37 degrees centigrade. But it may be increased several\r\ndegrees in consequence of disease. After death the chemical changes\r\nupon which the maintenance of this temperature depends rapidly\r\ndiminishes, and the body gradually cools to the temperature of the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere. This usually occurs in from about fifteen\r\nto twenty hours, but the time required depends upon a variety of\r\nconditions. Immediately after death there is, in nearly all cases, a\r\nslight elevation of internal temperature, owing to the fact that the\r\nmetabolic changes in the tissues still continue for a time, while the\r\nblood ceases to be cooled by passing through the lungs and peripheral\r\ncapillaries. After death from certain diseases yellow fever, cholera,\r\nrheumatic fever, and tetanus, a considerable elevation of internal\r\ntemperature has been repeatedly observed.\r\n\r\nThe time occupied by the cooling of the body may be prolonged after\r\nsudden death from accidents, acute diseases, apoplexy, and asphyxia.\r\nA number of cases is reported in which the body retained its heat for\r\nseveral days without known cause.\r\n\r\nAfter death from wasting chronic diseases, and in some cases after\r\nsevere hemorrhage, the cooling of the body is very rapid, the internal\r\ntemperature being reduced to that of the surrounding air within four or\r\nfive hours.\r\n\r\nFat bodies cool less quickly than lean ones, the bodies of well\r\nnourished adults less quickly than those of children or old persons.\r\nThe temperature of the surrounding atmosphere, the degree of protection\r\nof the body from currents of air, of course, modify the progress of\r\ncooling; and the internal organs naturally retain their heat longer\r\nthan the surface of the body. The rate at which cooling occurs is\r\nmost rapid as a rule, during the hours immediately following death,\r\nnotwithstanding the postmortem rise which may ensue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cadaveric Lividity.=—This means the black and blue discoloration from\r\nthe effects of the congestion or contusion of the blood.\r\n\r\nAfter life becomes extinct, and before the blood coagulates, it\r\nchanges its position chiefly in two ways: First, it is driven by their\r\ncontraction out of the arteries and into the veins; second, it settles\r\nin the veins and the capillaries of the more dependent parts of the\r\nbody, inducing, usually within a few hours after death, a mottling of\r\nthe surface with irregular livid patches. These patches may coalesce,\r\nforming a uniform dusky red color over the back of the trunk, head\r\nand extremities, and sometimes over the ears, face and neck. The same\r\neffect is noticed on the anterior aspect of the body if it has lain\r\non the face. At points of pressure, from the folds in the clothing,\r\nand from the weight of the body on the bed or the cooling board, the\r\nred color is absent or less marked. This to the undertaker and the\r\nembalmer is known as postmortem discoloration. These changes occur\r\nbefore putrefaction sets in. This cadaveric lividity should not be\r\nmistaken for the antemortem ecchymoses from which it may usually be\r\ndistinguished by its position and extent by the fact that the surface\r\nof the skin is not elevated, and by the fact that on incision no blood\r\nis found free in the interstices of the tissues. Not infrequently\r\nthe subcutaneous tissue in the neighborhood of these postmortem\r\ndiscolorations become infiltrated with a reddish serum. Very soon after\r\ndeath, particularly in warm weather, the tissues immediately around the\r\nsubcutaneous veins of the neck and the thorax and in other situations,\r\nmay become stained a bluish red color from the decomposition and escape\r\nfrom the vessels of the coloring matter of the blood. This to the\r\nundertaker and the embalmer is known as postmortem discoloration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Putrefactive Changes.=—As soon as the body dies, it becomes as any\r\nother inanimate object, subject to putrefaction and decay.\r\n\r\nThe tissues of the body undergo various changes as to consistency of\r\nthe solids, semi-solids, fluids, and as to color.\r\n\r\nPutrefactive changes are caused by the presence of putrefactive germs\r\nnormally present in the tissues or gaining access to them, which in\r\ntheir effort to satisfy their own nutrition, break down those complex\r\nmolecules of which the tissues are composed into simpler compounds.\r\n\r\nPutrefaction then is organic decomposition or decay the result\r\nof putrefactive bacteria. Putrefaction may also be defined as the\r\nseparating of the constituent elements of the body due to the presence\r\nand growth of bacteria.\r\n\r\nAlthough septic changes may take place before the death of a body, yet\r\nthe term putrefaction is not applied until after the death of a body,\r\nand denotes those changes in color, consistence, and smell so clearly\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nUsually in from one to three days, depending upon circumstances, a\r\ngreenish discoloration of the skin occurs at first upon the middle\r\nof the abdomen, over which it gradually spreads, assuming a deeper\r\nhue, and often changing to greenish purple or brown. Greenish patches\r\nmay now appear on the different parts of the body, earliest upon\r\nthose overlying the internal cavities; this discoloration is probably\r\nproduced by the action on the haemoglobin of gases developed by\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nThe eyeballs now become placid and if the eyelids are not closed the\r\nconjunctiva and cornea become brown and dry. The pressure of gases\r\ndeveloped by decomposition in the internal cavities not infrequently\r\nforces a greater or less quantity of frothy, reddish fluid or mucous\r\nfrom the mouth and nostrils, distends the abdomen, and, if excessive,\r\nmay lead to changes in the position of the blood in the vessels and\r\neven a moderate amount of displacement of the internal organs.\r\n\r\nAfter five or six days, under ordinary circumstances, the entire\r\nsurface is discolored to a green or a brown. After this the epidermis\r\nbecomes loosened through the formation of gases and separating of\r\nfluids beneath, and the tissues become flaccid.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen and the thorax may be greatly distended, and the features\r\ndistorted and scarcely recognizable from swelling, and the hair and\r\nnails loosened.\r\n\r\nOn the interior of the body, those soft and less compact tissues,\r\nor those tissues in which there is a great amount of fluid, are the\r\nfirst to decompose. This may be noticed by examining the walls of the\r\ntrachea, esophagus and the intestines and noting the change in color.\r\n\r\nDecomposition of the soft and liquid portions of the body take place\r\nalmost immediately after the death of the body, and then follow in\r\nrapid succession the decomposition of the semi-solids and finally the\r\nsolids. Beyond this stage of putrefaction, the consecutive changes can\r\nscarcely be followed with accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe putrefactive changes can not be said to begin at the same place in\r\nall bodies, as the conditions under which death occurred will regulate\r\nthat. The rapidity with which these changes follow one another depends\r\nupon a variety of conditions such as temperature, moisture, access of\r\nair and the diseases which have preceded or caused death.\r\n\r\nVarious temperature relations will effect greatly the more or less\r\nrapid decomposition of the body. Bodies dying in mid-summer are\r\ndecomposed much more quickly than those dying in mid-winter.\r\n\r\nMoisture added to the temperature relation will hasten the rapidity\r\nof the decomposition as can be noticed in those localities with a high\r\ntemperature but moist climate that the decomposition takes place very\r\nquickly. In those climates with high temperature, but dry or absence\r\nof moisture, the tendency is to dry up the tissues, and instead of\r\nputrefaction we have mummification as the result. This last statement\r\nthen serves to explain the reason for the high state of preservation in\r\nthe forms of mummification as exists in those countries like Egypt with\r\ntheir extremely hot and dry climates.\r\n\r\nExposure added to the temperature and the moisture relations adds\r\ngreatly to the rapidity of the decomposition. A moist climate with a\r\nhot temperature and free exposure favors rapid decomposition. We notice\r\nthat putrefaction progresses much more rapidly in the air than in the\r\nwater and in the earth its progress is slower than in the water. The\r\nmore exposed a body is then, to the elements, especially the air, the\r\nmore rapid will be the decomposition.\r\n\r\nAn elevated temperature and the presence of air and moisture hasten the\r\nadvent and progress of putrefactive changes.\r\n\r\nBodies dying in high fever and edematous subjects are much more quickly\r\ndecomposed than those dying with the ordinary wasting away disease.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of infants usually decompose more rapidly than those of\r\nadults, fat bodies more rapidly than lean ones.\r\n\r\nThe infectious diseases, intemperance, and the puerperal condition\r\npromote rapid decomposition as also does death from suffocation.\r\n\r\nPoisoning from arsenic, alcohol, antimony, sulphuric acid, strychnine\r\nand chloroform may retard the progress of decay.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, then, to say how long a body will keep without the\r\nuse of preservatives, as it depends partly upon temperature, partly\r\nupon moisture, partly upon the amount of exposure and partly upon the\r\nconditions existing in the body before death.\r\n\r\nWe can easily understand the reason for all this if we understand the\r\nbacteriology relating to the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, bacteria require for their best and most rapid\r\ngrowth the proper temperature, moisture and media relations. By this\r\nwe mean that the temperature should be moderately warm, ranging from\r\nabout forty to one hundred degrees Fahrenheit, the optimum being\r\nabout the body temperature 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 37 degrees on\r\nthe centigrade scale. With this optimum temperature, the element of\r\nmoisture should always be present, as we find that nothing in nature\r\nwill germinate without the necessary moisture. Then the bacteria must\r\nhave the proper media, meaning that they must have the right substance\r\non which to grow. Inasmuch as the cause of putrefaction is the host\r\nof putrefactive bacteria which abound trying to satisfy their own\r\nnutrition, and since these bacteria require a moderately warm and\r\nmoist media on which to grow, it is only natural that putrefaction and\r\ndecomposition should occur much more rapidly in warm moist climates\r\nthan in dry cold climates.\r\n\r\nIn regard to exposure we learn that certain putrefactive bacteria are\r\naerobic in character, i. e., that they need a great quantity of oxygen\r\nfor their growth, and for this reason a body in water or buried in\r\nthe earth does not decompose as rapidly as one exposed to the air.\r\nBut although they do not decompose as rapidly yet we find that they do\r\ndecompose in time. This is due to the fact that there is another class\r\nof bacteria, called anaerobic, i. e., which do not need oxygen for\r\ntheir growth. In the case of the body in water these anaerobic bacteria\r\nexist and develope slowly in the alimentary tract, and eliminate gases\r\nsufficient to bring the body to the surface, where the aerobic bacteria\r\nenter, and putrefaction progresses much more rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe starting point of decomposition is usually at the seat of the\r\ndisease the subject had before death, but it soon spreads to all the\r\nvarious tissues of the body.\r\n\r\nPutrefaction is always accompanied by a great amount of odor, which\r\nis caused by the generation of gases the result of bacterial action.\r\nThe obnoxious gases, offensive to the smell are sulphureted hydrogen,\r\nnitrogen, carbonic acid and ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe material actually present when the body is actually decomposed has\r\nbeen determined as being water, nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, etc.\r\n\r\n_Treatment by the Embalmer._—Putrefaction always means that there\r\nis present a great amount of putrefactive bacteria and if you are to\r\narrest this condition you must resort to the most thorough embalming.\r\nBy placing some preservative fluid in the arteries and having a\r\nthorough circulation all the tissues of the body can be reached\r\nand hence the complete destruction of those bacteria causing the\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nIf all the tissues are properly bathed with embalming fluid there need\r\nbe no further danger of putrefaction; but what seems sometimes at first\r\na thorough circulation, proves afterward to be only a partial one. If\r\nafter several days the body still shows signs of decomposition it is\r\nbest to reinject or if the decomposition only occurs in spots a simple\r\nhypodermic injection will prove adequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Skin Slip.=—To properly understand the causes of skin slip a thorough\r\nknowledge of the structure of the skin is necessary. It would be best\r\nthen to turn to the chapter on the tissues of the body and study the\r\nminute structure of the skin.\r\n\r\nSkin slip is caused by a putrefactive softening of the epidermis.\r\nThere is a watery infiltration from the minute capillaries and the\r\nsurrounding tissues between the dermis and the epidermis, causing the\r\nlatter to loosen and if touched to slip and tear away from the dermis\r\nor true skin.\r\n\r\nMany embalmers have been led to believe that the slipping of the skin\r\nis due to the use of certain fluids used in injecting the arterial\r\nsystem. This error should be corrected, as it is most generally the\r\nabsence of the fluid from the part which results in the slipping of the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the heart, liver, kidney and dropsical conditions\r\npredispose to the early skin slip. The immense amount of water\r\noccurring in the minute capillaries of the skin prohibits the embalming\r\nfluid from reaching the tissues.\r\n\r\nSkin slip then is due to putrefactive changes occurring in the skin,\r\nand if it should occur after embalming, it is positive proof that the\r\npart or parts have not received a sufficient quantity of a preservative\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\n_Treatment by the Embalmer._—In the average case you will never see\r\nskin slip, because you will be called comparatively soon after death\r\nhas occurred and the body will be embalmed and buried before this later\r\nform of putrefaction will manifest itself. But in some few cases you\r\nwill have to keep the body for a greater length of time, say to await\r\nthe arrival of some friend living abroad, or it may be a coroner's\r\ncase. In cases like this the body being kept for a period of weeks,\r\nwill if it is not perfectly embalmed show signs of skin slip. As has\r\nbeen stated above, cases that die from diseases causing dropsical\r\ninfiltration in the subcutaneous tissues should also be handled\r\ncarefully. If you are aware before hand that you are to keep the body\r\nfor a great length of time or that you have a dropsical subject, a\r\nlittle formaldehyde should be added to the fluid that is injected,\r\nabout two or three ounces to each quart of fluid. Zinc compounds might\r\nbe added, but formaldehyde is better because of its great affinity for\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIf skin slip occurs after the body is embalmed it is best to place a\r\nlayer of cotton over the part where the skin slip occurs and saturate\r\nthe cotton with equal parts of alcohol, formaldehyde and glycerine.\r\n\r\nIn drowned cases where all the skin is slipping it is best to envelope\r\nthe whole body with a layer of cotton saturated with formaldehyde.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rigor Mortis.=—Rigor mortis is the stiffening condition which occurs\r\non the body after death.\r\n\r\nWhen the muscle substance dies it becomes rigid, or goes into a\r\ncondition of rigor; it passes from a fluid to a solid state. The rigor\r\nthat appears in the muscles after somatic death is designated usually\r\nas rigor mortis, since its occurrence explains the death stiffening\r\nin the cadaver. It is characterized by several features: the muscles\r\nbecome rigid, they shorten, they develope an acid reaction, and they\r\nlose their irritability to stimuli.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of an individual the muscles enter into rigor mortis\r\nat different times. Usually there is a certain sequence, the order\r\ngiven being the jaws, neck, trunk, upper limbs, lower limbs, the rigor,\r\ntherefore, taking a downward course. The actual time of the appearance\r\nof the rigidity varies greatly, however; it may come on within a few\r\nminutes or a number of hours may elapse before it can be detected.\r\n\r\nDeath after great muscular exertion, as in the case of hunted animals,\r\nor soldiers killed in battle, is usually followed quickly by muscle\r\nrigor. Death after wasting diseases is also followed by an early rigor,\r\nwhich in this case is of a more feeble character and shorter duration.\r\n\r\nCertain drugs such as veratrum, hydrocyanic acid, caffeine and\r\nchloroform, will hasten the development of rigor.\r\n\r\nPeople who die in full habit, meaning that there has been no muscular\r\nexertion or wasting processes before death, usually have the rigor\r\ndeveloping more slowly and of a longer duration.\r\n\r\nAfter a certain interval, which also varies greatly, from one to six\r\ndays, the rigidity passes off, the muscles become soft and flexible;\r\nthis phenomenon is known as the release of the rigor.\r\n\r\nThe usual explanation that is given of rigor is that it is due to a\r\ncoagulation of the fluid substance, the muscle plasma, of which the\r\nfibers are constituted. During life the fluids exist in a liquid or\r\nviscous condition; after death they coagulate into a solid form.\r\n\r\nRigor mortis is not a sign of death, as there is rigidity of the\r\nmuscles following apparent death, as in cases of asphyxia and trance.\r\nIf the body is rigid, in a case in which there is a doubt that death\r\nis present the rigidity may be broken up. If it is a case of trance or\r\nthat of the contraction of the muscles following drowning, it is likely\r\nto return, especially in case of trance; but if death is actually\r\npresent it will not return.\r\n\r\nThe chemical changes occurring, the result of rigor mortis can be\r\nbriefly stated:\r\n\r\n(a) There is a coagulation of the proteid material of the muscle plasma.\r\n\r\n(b) There is an increased acidity, which is doubtless due to the\r\nproduction of lactic acid.\r\n\r\n(c) There is a production of carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\n(d) There is a consumption of glycogen.\r\n\r\n_Treatment by the Embalmer._—Many times when called to embalm a subject\r\nyou will find the body in a state of rigor. In cases of this kind the\r\nrigor mortis should be broken up. This can be done by taking each of\r\nthe joints and gradually bend them a little at a time until they become\r\nperfectly lax. Once a joint is bent the stiffening disappears and the\r\nembalmer can proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fermentation and the Production of Gas.=—A molecule is the smallest\r\nportion of a compound which can exist by itself.\r\n\r\nAn atom is one of the ultimate particles composing a molecule. A\r\ncomplex molecule is one in which two or more elements have been\r\ncombined. Example: water molecules are formed by two atoms of hydrogen\r\nand one atom of oxygen.\r\n\r\nA ferment is a substance causing fermentation in other matter with\r\nwhich it comes in contact. There are two kinds of ferment expressed by\r\nthe names organized and unorganized.\r\n\r\nUnorganized ferments are chemical substances having the power to\r\nproduce or assist in the production of fermentation.\r\n\r\nOrganized ferments are bacteria having the power to produce\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nFermentation means the process through which complex molecules are\r\ndecomposed and their ingredients disassociated by the action of\r\nferments. As an example of fermentation, we can take proteid food\r\nsubstances, the molecules of which are always of complex form, and\r\nby subjecting them to the action of organized ferments (bacteria),\r\ndecompose them, and separate each gas ingredient, obtaining therefrom a\r\nvariety of gases from what was formerly a substance of perfect chemical\r\nunion. Fermentation is present in most of the natural processes\r\nwhereby chemical changes are produced in animal and vegetable matter.\r\nFermentation is taking place all the time in all the climes excepting\r\npossibly the frigid zones. The organized ferments (bacteria) are\r\nsubject to the same temperature limits that govern the reproduction and\r\nthe growth of all bacteria.\r\n\r\nFermentation is divided into spirituous fermentation, digestive\r\nfermentation, metabolic fermentation, and putrefactive fermentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spirituous Fermentation.=—Spirituous fermentation is that process\r\nof fermentation by which forms of yeast cells, by their growth and\r\nreproduction in such complex substances as grapes, fruit, apple\r\njuice, grains, etc., extract alcohol from these substances and by this\r\nprocess produce wine, cider, spirits, etc. Many times in the dead body,\r\nspirituous fermentation occurs. Spirituous fermentation is caused by a\r\nvegetable parasite called yeast.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Digestive Fermentation.=—Digestive fermentation is that process by\r\nwhich digestion and nutrition in the living body is assisted through\r\nthe action of ferments called enzymes, acting on the food substance.\r\nThis process is mainly one where each food particle is split up by a\r\nparticular ferment or enzyme. After death this process may continue for\r\na certain length of time and result in the formation of gas. Digestive\r\nfermentation is mostly chemical.\r\n\r\nEnzymes are unorganized ferments and are cast off the living body\r\nwithin the living body.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Metabolic Fermentation.=—Metabolic fermentation is that process by\r\nwhich enzymes in the tissues of the living body destroy the dead cells,\r\nand reduce them to the following gases: nitrogen (N), carbon-dioxide\r\n(CO₂), ammonia (NH₃), uric acid, and other materials. In the living\r\nbody these gases and other products are eliminated from the tissues,\r\nby the sudoriferous glands and ducts through perspiration, by the\r\nlungs with the expired air, by the intestines with the feces and by\r\nthe kidneys with the urine. In the dead body the enzymes become active\r\nagents in tissue gas production, unless they are kept in restraint by\r\nbeing brought in contact with germicidal embalming fluids.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Putrefactive Fermentation.=—Putrefactive fermentation is the process\r\nby which undigested food substances (principally proteids), under the\r\ninfluence of ferment bacteria, yield gases. This change rarely takes\r\nplace in the small intestines of the living body as the germs are held\r\nin restraint by lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria in those parts.\r\nThere is little restraint to their activity in the large intestines,\r\nhowever, and the intestinal gases along with putrefactive changes in\r\nfecal material are a natural consequence.\r\n\r\nIntestinal fermentation is hastened in the dead body by the presence of\r\nmuch undigested food and the absence of any restraining organisms. The\r\ngases produced in the intestines of either the living or dead body by\r\nthe action of putrefactive ferment bacteria are: carbon-dioxide (CO₂),\r\nhydrogen (H), nitrogen (N) hydrogen sulphide (H₂S), methane (CH₄).\r\nThe continued fermentation in the stomach and the intestines causes a\r\ncoffee colored material of a frothy character to purge from the mouth.\r\n\r\nWhen the hollow needle or trocar is used to reach the scene of ferment\r\nactivity, the gases mentioned are released from the effected organs.\r\nAs these gases are extremely odorous, they should be passed through\r\na pledget of cotton saturated with formaldehyde, before being allowed\r\nto pass into the open air. Germicidal fluids when directed against the\r\nbacteria in an intelligent manner should destroy them and prevent their\r\nbecoming active again.\r\n\r\nPutrefactive fermentation is divided as follows: abdominal\r\nfermentation, gastric fermentation, and intestinal fermentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Abdominal Fermentation.=—Abdominal fermentation is putrefactive\r\nfermentation as it effects the tissues and necrotic substances of the\r\nabdominal cavity itself (excepting the digestive organs), caused by\r\nthe action of zymogenic bacteria. Perforations of the intestines or\r\nappendix, inflammation of the mesentery or peritoneum, may allow putrid\r\nmaterial to escape into the cavity proper, where bacterial action will\r\nproduce noxious gases. You will recognize a condition of this kind\r\nby the following illustration: As soon as the point of the trocar\r\nhas penetrated the peritoneum and the rod has been withdrawn, there\r\nwill be an escape of gas. This escape is due to the internal pressure\r\nbeing greater than the atmosphere pressure. This explains the swollen\r\ncondition of the abdominal wall and its subsequent relaxation as the\r\ngas is allowed to escape.\r\n\r\nCertain diseases predispose to abdominal fermentation as inflammatory\r\ndiseases which effect the peritoneal covering of the organs, and cause\r\na swollen abdominal wall after death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—In the treatment of these cases it is always advisable\r\nthat the operator be familiar with the location of the disease, so\r\nthat direct trocar application can be made to the affected part. The\r\nlocation of the affected part is not always the same, as it varies\r\nwith the location of the particular tissue or organ affected. In\r\nappendicitis, where death has occurred without surgical attempts to\r\nremove the appendix, the operator should spray the right inguinal space\r\nwith enough fluid to neutralize the cause of the gas. Where the cause\r\nof death has been typhoid, the umbilical, hypogastric and epigastric\r\nspaces should be sprayed. Where the cause of death is puerperal fever,\r\nthe right and left inguinal and hypogastric spaces should be sprayed.\r\nThe gas itself, will be eliminated from the cavity of the body by\r\nsimply inserting the trocar and allowing the gas to escape until the\r\ninternal pressure approximates that of the atmospheric pressure. This\r\nthough does not prevent the reformation of gas, as the origin of the\r\ngas is the living and growing fermentative and putrefactive bacteria.\r\nTo prevent a recurrence the bacteria must be killed, and this is done\r\nby spraying a germicidal fluid around the affected part. Abdominal\r\nfermentation and gas is much easier to treat than gastric or intestinal\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gastric Fermentation.=—This is recognized by a frothy coffee colored\r\npurge from the mouth or nose caused by pressure in the stomach, due\r\nto putrefactive bacteria, and their action on proteid food substances\r\nwhich are present in the stomach. Where the cause of death has been\r\nprincipally from inflammatory processes, or where the deceased has died\r\nshortly after eating a full meal, this condition must be looked forward\r\nto. The swollen condition directly over the stomach is another visible\r\nsign of value in diagnosing the condition.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—When the body is placed in your care, the embalmer should\r\nmake a careful and thoughtful survey of the condition of the body and\r\nthe cause of death. Any inflammatory disease of the abdominal tissues\r\nor a full meal eaten shortly before death will almost always predispose\r\nto the formation of gas. The treatment would be to take proper care of\r\nthe stomach contents.\r\n\r\n(a) Insert the trocar at a point two inches to the left of the median\r\nline, half the distance from the ensiform cartilage and the umbilicus.\r\nDirect the trocar downward and diagonally to the left to a depth of\r\nthree to four inches. Remove the trocar rod and allow the gas to escape\r\ninto a fluid bottle, containing a small amount of fluid, so that the\r\ngas may be deodorized. Before removing the trocar, inject not less\r\nthan one pint of normal fluid into the stomach, so that the fermentable\r\nmaterials and the bacteria may be destroyed.\r\n\r\n(b) Make an incision in the median line of the body, three inches long,\r\nfrom the tip of the ensiform cartilage downward toward the umbilicus,\r\nand proceed as directed for the direct incision described on page 257.\r\n\r\nThe treatment for gastric fermentation demands the specific treatment\r\nas directed above. No short treatments can be depended upon for certain\r\nresults. Cotton placed in the mouth only delays the time for the\r\npurging to begin from the mouth. Gastric fermentation can be prevented\r\nin all cases by the use of the specific treatments as described in (a)\r\nand (b).\r\n\r\nIf in your practice, you receive a body from a shipping undertaker,\r\nwhich unfortunately was not treated in the correct manner, and which is\r\npurging from the mouth, arrange to puncture the stomach in the manner\r\ndescribed in treatment (a). This can be done without disturbing the\r\nposition of the body in the casket, by opening the clothes above the\r\nstomach. After puncturing the stomach and allowing the gas to escape,\r\ninject not less than one pint of fluid therein, cleanse the mouth with\r\nabsorbent cotton by the use of the lock forceps and a recurrence of the\r\npurge will not be possible.\r\n\r\nIf in your practice you have overlooked the possibility of gastric\r\nfermentation, and find, either by advice from the family or from your\r\nown observation, that purging is going on, use either the treatment (a)\r\nor (b), neutralize the fermentable material, cleanse the mouth and no\r\nrecurrence will be possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Intestinal Fermentation.=—Here we have the fermenting gases in the\r\nintestines and the colons. The pressure of the gases will bear upon the\r\nstomach and there may or may not be purging from the mouth depending\r\nupon the fact of presence or non presence of material in the stomach.\r\nThe abdomen though will be greatly distended, and when palpated will\r\ngive a drummy note.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—(a) Insert the trocar through the umbilicus, and direct\r\nthe point downward into the right inguinal region so as to relieve the\r\ngases from the caecum, then inject a small quantity of fluid; then\r\ndirect the point of the trocar upward into the left inguinal region\r\nso as to relieve gases from the sigmoid flexure, and inject a small\r\nquantity of fluid; then direct the point of the trocar upward into\r\nthe right hypogastric region so as to relieve gases from the hepatic\r\nflexure, and inject a small quantity of fluid; then direct the point\r\nof the trocar upward into the left hypogastric region so as to remove\r\ngases from the splenic flexure, and inject a small quantity of fluid;\r\nand if at this time it is thought that the stomach contains gas,\r\nrelieve it, and inject therein a small quantity of fluid; now place\r\nsome fluid directly into the abdomen around the small intestine and\r\nwith this treatment you are assured that your intestinal fermentation\r\nis taken care of.\r\n\r\n(b) Intestinal fermentation may also be treated by the direct incision,\r\nas described on page 257.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nDISCOLORATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Discolorations.=—Discolorations should be treated as a separate\r\nand independent subject because they are causes of great annoyance\r\nand embarrassment to the operator, and their treatment is of utmost\r\nimportance. Just think of the possibility of having a body properly\r\ninjected, and the preservation complete, and something along the line\r\nof a discoloration coming to the front and ruin the results of the\r\nwork. If there is any condition possible in the dead body that can\r\ncause more trouble to the embalmer than discolorations in general,\r\nit has not as yet been discovered. You have only to realize what the\r\nappearance of a body would be in the casket, if any discolorations were\r\npresent on an exposed surface, to know that too much can not be said on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nDiscolorations may not occur in conjunction with tissue changes, so\r\nwhen they do occur we should look for the cause of the same before\r\ndeciding just what the name of the discoloration is, or what treatment\r\nshould be given to eradicate it.\r\n\r\nFor convenience in study, and for the proper classification of\r\nthe various conditions, the subject has been divided into those\r\ndiscolorations occurring before death, and those discolorations which\r\nmay occur in the body after death.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Discolorations Occurring before Death.=—Those discolorations occurring\r\nbefore death and which would remain on the body after death would be:\r\n\r\n  (a) Yellow jaundice,\r\n  (b) Pigmentary atrophy,\r\n  (c) Cancerous spots,\r\n  (d) Gangrene,\r\n  (e) Ecchymosis or ante-mortem staining,\r\n  (f) Wounds, fractures, scars and tattoo marks.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) =Yellow Jaundice.=—In the study of the liver you have heard that\r\nthe liver secretes a digestive juice called the bile.\r\n\r\nBile acts as the natural antiseptic of the intestines in life, and aids\r\nwith the digestion of fatty food substances along with other actions.\r\nThe principal coloring matter of the bile is a yellow substance called\r\nbili-rubin. Biliverdin, green, is precipitated by alkalies.\r\n\r\nThe course of this bile in life is from the liver to the gall bladder,\r\nwhich acts as the reservoir, into the cystic duct and then into the\r\ncommon bile duct and into the cavity of the duodenum (first section\r\nof the small intestines). It sometimes happens that there may be an\r\nobstruction of the bile ducts with the result that the bile is backed\r\nup into the gall bladder, and from there into the liver again, throwing\r\nit into the blood vessels of the liver and out into the tissues of\r\nthe body along with the blood. As the blood traverses the entire area\r\nof the body, and as the yellow coloring matter of the bile acts as a\r\nstain, it is only a matter of course that the tissues will be stained\r\nthe characteristic color of the bile.\r\n\r\nThis stain will be found all over the body from the outer layer of\r\nthe skin to the membrane covering the bone (the periosteum) and will\r\nadhere very closely to the tissues, rendering the removal practically\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nOrdinary arterial injection of a body of this character will have\r\nabsolutely no effect, no matter what preservative fluid may be used and\r\nregardless of whatever any one may say, as it stands to reason that\r\nwhen the discoloration is not located in the blood vessels, that the\r\nremoval of same can not be accomplished by flushing the blood vessels\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nOf course, the washing of the blood vessels with a solution will\r\naid the removal of the discoloration, but it is necessary to employ\r\na strong bleaching solution on the outer surface of the exposed\r\nparts in order to better the conditions so that the body may be made\r\npresentable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this treatment, it would be advisable to color the\r\nlights in the room in which the body is to be shown, so as to make\r\nevery thing in the room about the same color of the body, including the\r\npersons viewing the remains. This will have the effect of lessening the\r\napparent bad color of the body, and will add to your reputation as an\r\nembalmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) =Pigmentary Atrophy.=—Here is another instance of the work of bile\r\npigments or coloring matters, in which not only the yellow, but the\r\ngreen colors are deposited in the tissue cells. In addition to this,\r\nthe cells all over the body atrophy (contract or reduce in size). The\r\ncontraction of the cells may be due to imperfect nutrition or perhaps\r\nanemia or some other action causing great emaciation of the body.\r\n\r\nYou will see very readily that the main point of difference between\r\nyellow jaundice and pigmentary atrophy is in the color, and also in the\r\nfact that the cells in yellow jaundice are in their normal state and in\r\npigmentary atrophy are in a contracted condition. The treatment given\r\nfor yellow jaundice as follows: injecting and washing the blood vessels\r\nwith a mild solution and the application to the affected parts of a\r\nstrong bleaching solution, should be given for pigmentary atrophy.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions as regarding the lights to show the body under, should\r\nalso be noted and used in these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) =Cancerous Spots.=—What is intended for this particular\r\ndiscoloration, is not the ordinary cancer that has eaten through the\r\nskin, but that form sometimes noted in aged persons where the cancer is\r\njust about to come through the skin. In other words, a yellowish brown\r\ncolor showing in any of the exposed parts of the skin before death.\r\n\r\nAs cancer is in fact a rottening or mortification of the tissues, the\r\ninjection with a hypodermic outfit of a strong hardening and bleaching\r\nsolution will harden and bleach out the color of the cancer to a great\r\nextent, and thus improve the appearance greatly, the ordinary cosmetic\r\npowders will finish the preparation.\r\n\r\nFor the hypodermic injection we would suggest the following:\r\n\r\n  R   Alum, 10 gr.\r\n      Corrosive sublimate, 5 gr.\r\n      Zinc chloride, 5 gr.\r\n      Grain alcohol, 4 fluid oz.\r\n      Formaldehyde, 2 fluid oz.\r\n\r\nThe cancerous spot should not be confounded with the color of\r\ndessication which will resemble it somewhat. The main point of\r\ndifference would be that the cancer would be present before death,\r\nand the dessication could not possibly occur until after the body\r\nis embalmed. This caution is advised on account of the tendency the\r\nsolution to be injected hypodermically would have to make a dried spot\r\nworse in color than better.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) =Gangrene.=—Gangrene can best be described as the death of certain\r\nareas of tissue of the living body. The death of the tissue may be\r\nbrought about by very many causes; by vascular obstruction and arrest\r\nof the blood supply to a part, or of the outflow from a part; by\r\nenfeebled circulation; temporary stoppage of the circulation of a part\r\nor organ; acute infection; and by burns.\r\n\r\nGangrene with its peculiar color, a dark green, is not often found on\r\nthe exposed surfaces of the body, but will more often be found on the\r\nlower extremities and then only on the bodies of aged persons. For this\r\nreason it will be unnecessary to treat it for the removal of color.\r\n\r\n\r\n(e) =Ecchymosis, or Antemortem Staining.=—Ecchymosis is an\r\nextravasation of blood into the areolar tissues, forming a bruised\r\nplace caused principally by a blow from a heavy instrument or missile.\r\n\r\nThis form of discoloration is mostly seen in accident cases, where\r\ndeath was due to mechanical causes.\r\n\r\nIn ecchymosis the blood capillaries being ruptured, the blood permeates\r\nthe bruised tissues surrounding the ruptured vessels and thus gives the\r\ncharacteristic color of venous blood. There seems to be no positive\r\ntreatment, but in some cases it can be remedied to some degree by a\r\nhypodermic injection of a good bleacher, and then massaging the part\r\nwith a strong bleaching solution. Spots of this kind can sometimes be\r\ncovered with flesh tints.\r\n\r\nIt is often important to determine whether violence has been inflicted\r\non a body before death. In regard to this point, we must remember,\r\nfirst, that blows and falls of sufficient violence to fracture bones\r\nand rupture the viscera may leave no marks on the skin, even though\r\nthe person has survived for several days; and, second, that there are\r\npostmortem appearances which simulate antemortem bruises. A severe\r\ncontusion during life may present, at first, no mark or only a general\r\nredness. After a short time the injured part becomes swollen and of\r\na red color, this color may be succeeded by a dark blue, and this in\r\nturn fade into a greenish yellow or yellow; these later appearances\r\nare due to an escape of blood from the vessels and to a subsequent\r\ndecomposition of the hemoglobin. If, therefore, we cut into such an\r\necchymosis after death, we find extravasated blood or the coloring\r\nmatter of the blood, in the form of pigment granules, free in the\r\ntissues. Postmortem discolorations, on the other hand, although their\r\nexternal appearance may resemble that of antemortem ecchymosis, are not\r\nformed by an extravasation of blood, but by a circumscribed congestion\r\nof the vessels or by an escape of blood stained serum. If you cut\r\ninto such discolorations, therefore, we find no blood outside the\r\nvessels. Care should be taken not to mistake the lesions of hemorrhagic\r\ninfection for traumatic ecchymosis.\r\n\r\nBlows on the skin of a body which has been dead for not more than two\r\nhours may produce true ecchymosis with extravasation of blood, such\r\nas can be distinguished with great difficulty or not at all from those\r\nformed during life. If putrefactive changes be present, the difficulty\r\nof distinguishing between antemortem and postmortem bruises is greatly\r\nenhanced.\r\n\r\nHanging and strangulation are attended with the formation of marks\r\non the neck which are described in works on forensic medicine. These\r\nmarks must not be confounded with the natural creases of the skin of\r\nthe neck. Many adults during life have creases of the skin of the neck,\r\none or more in number, running downward from the ear under the chin or\r\nencircling the neck. After death these creases may be much more evident\r\nthan during life, and may be rendered more decided by the position of\r\nthe head, or if the body be frozen. They usually persist until the skin\r\nputrefies.\r\n\r\n\r\n(f) =Wounds.=—The embalmer should notice the situation, extent and the\r\ndirection of a wound, the condition of the edges, and the surrounding\r\ntissues. If it be a deep, penetrating wound, its course and extent\r\nshould be ascertained by careful dissection rather than by the use of\r\na probe.\r\n\r\nIf the edges of a wound be inflamed and suppurating, or beginning to\r\nheal, it must have been inflicted some time before death. In a wound\r\ninflicted a short time before death the edges are usually everted;\r\nthere may be more or less extravasation of blood into the surrounding\r\ntissues, and the vessels contain coagulated blood; but sometimes\r\nnone of these changes occur. The chief characteristics of a wound\r\ninflicted after death are absence of a considerable amount of bleeding,\r\nnon-retraction of edges, and the absence of extravasation of blood into\r\nthe tissues. But a wound inflicted within two hours after death may\r\nresemble very closely one received during life. In general, unless a\r\nwound is old enough for the edges to present inflammatory changes, the\r\nembalmer must be very careful in asserting its antemortem or postmortem\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n\r\n(g) =Fractures.=—It may be important to determine whether a bone was\r\nfractured before or after death. This point can not always be decided.\r\nFractures inflicted during life are, as a rule, attended with more\r\nextravasation of blood and evidences of reaction in the surrounding\r\ntissues; but fractures produced within a few hours after death may\r\nresemble these very closely. Usually a greater degree of force is\r\nnecessary to fracture bones in the dead than in the living body.\r\n\r\n\r\n(h) =Scars and Tattoo Marks.=—The presence and character of these\r\nshould be noted. Scars produced by any considerable loss of substance\r\nmay become very much smaller and less conspicuous, but never entirely\r\ndisappear. Slight and superficial wounds, however, leave marks which\r\nmay not be permanent.\r\n\r\nThe discoloration produced by tattooing may, although it rarely does,\r\ndisappear during life. The embalmer should not try to remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nDISCOLORATIONS.—Continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Discolorations Occurring After death.=—Those discolorations occurring\r\nafter death would be as follows:\r\n\r\n  (a) Desiccation.\r\n  (b) Greenish tinge of putrefaction.\r\n  (c) Chemical action.\r\n  (d) Postmortem discoloration.\r\n  (e) Postmortem staining.\r\n  (f) Capillary or venous congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Desiccation.=—This is a brownish color caused by the drying of the\r\nskin. Various conditions might cause this color of which a few are\r\nconsidered here:\r\n\r\nNatural evaporation, the drying action of formaldehyde, freezing the\r\nskin, feverish conditions of the body before death, absence of a normal\r\namount of moisture in the skin of the dead body.\r\n\r\n_Natural Evaporation._—The passage of moisture from the skin into a dry\r\natmosphere reduces the normal amount of moisture in the skin, thereby\r\nproducing an altered color. The extent of the moisture reduction\r\ngoverns the color produced. When evaporation begins, the skin loses its\r\nsoftness and becomes slightly yellow in color. As evaporation continues\r\nthe skin becomes more hard and the color changes from yellow to brown.\r\nAt this time nothing can be done to restore the original color as in\r\nthe absence of the blood circulation, the pigment of the skin will not\r\ntake up moisture, nor will moisture penetrate the skin itself.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The only treatment for a condition of this kind is\r\nnecessarily a preventive one. While embalming a body, the operator\r\nshould apply either water or one of the commercial face solutions to\r\nthe skin of all the exposed portions of the body. If the condition\r\nwithin the skin is one in which there is a predisposition toward\r\ndryness, the face solution or the water by being present on the skin\r\nwill reduce evaporation from the skin itself; in this way maintaining\r\nthe natural degree of moisture. Should a hard, dry spot appear in the\r\nabsence of any preventive treatment, the operator can only coat the\r\nspot with grease paint and thereby hide it.\r\n\r\n_The Drying Action of Formaldehyde._—Formaldehyde is derived from\r\nmethyl spirits, which in itself has an active affinity for water. The\r\namount of water ordinarily mixed in formalin in the compounding of a\r\nformaldehyde fluid is not sufficient to satisfy the appetite of the\r\nformaldehyde for more water. When a formaldehyde fluid comes in contact\r\nwith moisture laden skin, there will be a movement of moisture from\r\nthe skin toward the formaldehyde fluid, thereby reducing the degree\r\nof moisture in the skin and in that way causing it to become dry.\r\nWhen the skin becomes dry, it changes in color the same as in natural\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—There are three conditions in the skin met by the\r\noperator. The first is where there is a predisposition toward dryness\r\nand this is where the skin does not contain a normal amount of moisture\r\nto begin with. In old age cases, tubercular, and anemic bodies, the\r\nordinary embalming fluid should be diluted at least one half for the\r\nfirst part of the injection, thus reducing the appetite for moisture on\r\nthe part of the fluid. In addition to this, water or a face solution\r\nshould be used externally to prevent outward evaporation from further\r\nreducing the moisture in the skin. The fluid exhibits a tendency to\r\ndraw water into the pores, thus maintaining to a large degree, the\r\nnormal moisture percentage.\r\n\r\nThe second condition met with is one in which the skin contains a\r\nnormal amount of moisture. In this case it would not be necessary\r\nto reduce the strength of the standard fluid at any time during the\r\ninjection, but it is necessary to apply water or a face solution\r\nexternally to limit outward evaporation and to provide a source\r\nwhereby moisture could be drawn into the pores by the appetite of the\r\nformaldehyde, thus again maintaining the normal percentage of moisture\r\nin the skin.\r\n\r\nThe third condition is one in which the skin along with the balance\r\nof the body, will contain more than a normal percentage of moisture.\r\nThis condition may be looked for in edematous or dropsical cases. The\r\ninjection in these cases should be normal in strength unless the dropsy\r\nis very pronounced, when an overnormal injection can be given without\r\nreducing the moisture percentage in the skin below the normal point.\r\n\r\nShould the above precautions not be used and the skin be dried through\r\nthe appetite of formaldehyde for water, no treatment can be given which\r\nwill restore the moisture to the skin. When moisture is drawn from the\r\nskin and the percentage is below normal, the skin will shrink and will\r\ndraw tight against the bones and subcutaneous tissue. This frequently\r\ngives rise to the sharp nose and to the drawn appearance so common in\r\nthose cases. Prevention is the only remedy.\r\n\r\n_Freezing the Skin._—When the body is subjected to a temperature of 32\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, the moisture in the skin freezes, thereby removing\r\nit from its usual consideration, as the element that is responsible for\r\nthe usual softness and flexibility of the skin.\r\n\r\nIn the cold months, bodies are sometimes left in cold rooms with\r\nthe windows open. The embalmer did this in the past, thinking that\r\nsubjecting the body to the influence of a cold atmosphere would\r\nsimplify preservation.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of preservation alone, this theory is correct,\r\nbut in accomplishing the above result the moisture of the skin may be\r\nfrozen. The resulting color is light yellow. The texture of the skin is\r\nchanged from soft to a slightly hardened condition.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Never allow the room temperature to approach the freezing\r\npoint. Should the above treatment be disregarded, and the yellow\r\ncolor become present, have the room warmed, and the color will slowly\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n_Feverish Conditions in the Body Before Death._—Fever is the name\r\nusually given to the rise of temperature that goes with inflammation.\r\nIn severe inflammatory diseases, the tissues lose much of their\r\nmoisture through the arrest of the saturating power of the blood stream\r\nand the disturbance of circulation. The skin contains a sub-normal\r\namount of moisture when the embalmer reaches these cases, which may be\r\nfurther reduced by outward evaporation and the dehydrating power of the\r\nembalming fluid. Small brown spots resembling the fever blister in the\r\nliving body may be present around the mouth.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Use half strength fluid for the first part of the\r\ninjection, followed by normal fluid for the second, third and fourth\r\nparts. Apply water or a commercial skin or face solution while the\r\ninjection is going on.\r\n\r\n_Absence of a Normal Amount of Moisture in the Skin of the Body._—The\r\nnormal amount of moisture in the skin has been determined to be an\r\namount equal to seventy-five per cent. of the weight of the skin. Any\r\npercentage less than seventy-five per cent. is considered subnormal.\r\nThis condition can be expected in all fever cases, in anemics, and in\r\nold age.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—When the skin appears rather dry, the injection of fluid\r\nshould be half strength for the first and second parts, normal for\r\nthe third and fourth. The skin of the exposed parts of the body should\r\nbe dampened with an application of water or a commercial face or skin\r\nsolution, while the injection is being made.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Greenish Tinge of Putrefaction.=—Putrefaction discolorations are those\r\nwhich are produced when putrefactive bacteria become active in the skin\r\nor subcutaneous tissue.\r\n\r\nThis discoloration appears generally about the second day, unless\r\npreservative fluids have been applied to prevent it. It first begins in\r\nthe ileocaecal region or lower part of the abdomen. The skin covering\r\nthese parts assumes a brownish color which shades to yellow, yellowish\r\ngreen, and finally a green color. This green discoloration will in a\r\nfew days spread all over the surface of the body.\r\n\r\nAmong the putrefactive bacteria is the bacillus fluorescens, a\r\nchromogenic germ, which produces a greenish color when it becomes\r\nactive in the tissues. One of the first external evidences of\r\nputrefaction is the production of a greenish color in the abdominal\r\nwall. This, of course, could not occur when embalming had been done\r\nwith any degree of completeness. Should an insufficient circulation\r\nbe encountered when embalming a body, the part which does not receive\r\nthe fluid, being unprotected, may be affected by the color producing\r\ngerm mentioned above. The most likely to be affected by an insufficient\r\ncirculation will be located somewhere in the extremities of the\r\ncirculation, that is to say, in the skin. We can place the affected\r\npart more definitely in the skin of the face, particularly the nose,\r\nwhich has a rather poor circulation. This condition will not make\r\nits presence known until three or four days after embalming has been\r\ndone, making it almost entirely absent in bodies embalmed in ordinary\r\npractice. Should several days elapse between the time the body died\r\nand embalming, allowing the discoloration to appear, the following\r\ntreatment would be advisable:\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Inject a very small portion of the following solution just\r\nunder the skin, using a hypodermic needle.\r\n\r\n  Alum                          10 gr.\r\n  Corrosive Subl.               10 gr.\r\n  Zinc Chloride                  5 gr.\r\n  Grain Alcohol                  4 fl. oz.\r\n  Formaldehyde                   2 fl. oz.\r\n\r\nJust a small portion of the above solution is all that will be\r\nnecessary, working it under the skin with the finger tip, so as to\r\navoid destroying the features by swelling the tissues.\r\n\r\nThis treatment being a chemical one, it is necessarily slow in its\r\naction of bleaching the green color. Should haste be necessary, inject\r\na very small quantity of embalming fluid to arrest the putrefactive\r\nprocess and then cover the spot with theatrical grease of the proper\r\ncolor to match the surrounding skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chemical Action.=—Chemical action is any discoloration of the skin\r\nor tissues of the body which may be caused by the action of opposing\r\nchemicals. There is only one known discoloration occurring in the\r\nbody after death as a result of the presence of a chemical in the\r\nbody, which, when coming in contact with formaldehyde, produces a\r\ndiscoloration. This particular discoloration, greenish in color, is\r\nthe result of the work of the drug methylene blue in contact with\r\nformaldehyde.\r\n\r\nOften, in cases of chronic malaria, or diseases of the liver, or again\r\nas a general antiseptic, methylene blue will be administered by the\r\nattending physician, and you should learn this fact beforehand, for\r\nif methylene blue has been administered it is advisable not to use\r\na formaldehyde fluid. There is a chemical action set up between the\r\nformaldehyde and the methylene blue, which gives the tissues a greenish\r\ncolor, which is quite objectionable.\r\n\r\nIn this case you would use some fluid which does not contain\r\nformaldehyde, benzoate of soda, or borax, or peroxide solution should\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nAnother good formula to use is the following:\r\n\r\n  Rx\r\n\r\n  Carbolic acid                    5 oz.\r\n  Borax                           12 oz.\r\n  Glycerine                        1 oz.\r\n  Water, sufficient to make        1 gall\r\n\r\n                      or\r\n\r\n  Rx\r\n\r\n  Carbolic acid                    5 oz.\r\n  Oxalic acid                     12 oz.\r\n  Boracic acid                     2 oz.\r\n  Water, sufficient to make        1 gall\r\n\r\n\r\n=Postmortem Discoloration.=—This is a general expression, and refers to\r\nany discoloration which might occur on the body after death.\r\n\r\nWhat is usually meant, though, when this term is used is _the settling\r\nof the blood to the dependent parts of the body after death_. If the\r\nbody is lying on the back, the blood will naturally gravitate toward\r\nthe back, into the azygos system and cause a bluish discoloration, or\r\nthe same condition will result, if the body is found lying on the face\r\nand stomach, in which case the discoloration will be in the face and\r\nthe anterior chest and abdominal walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Postmortem Staining.=—This condition is caused by changes in the\r\nblood while in the veins. The blood becomes more fluid in character\r\nand the red blood corpuscles become granular and give off their oxygen\r\nwhich escapes through the walls of the veins and carrying with it the\r\nhaemoglobin or coloring matter of the blood, stains the tissues over\r\nthe superficial veins a purplish red color. This discoloration only\r\nappears on the ventral surface of the body and along the course of the\r\nlarge superficial veins. An excellent example of this discoloration\r\nis seen in the drowned subject where almost always all the superficial\r\nveins can be easily traced by this discoloration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Capillary or Venous Congestion.=—This term includes those\r\ndiscolorations either caused by gas distension or by the unskillful\r\ninjection of fluid into the vascular system. Gas forming in the\r\nabdominal or thoracic cavities will so press upon the heart as to empty\r\nit of its blood, which will be forced upwards into the large venous\r\ntrunks of the head, neck and axilla. All embalmers are familiar with\r\nthe flushed face which often appears when the arterial system has been\r\ninjected in a too hasty manner. It causes the veins and capillaries of\r\nthe face and neck to become congested the same as that caused by the\r\nformation of gases in the cavities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nARTERIAL EMBALMING.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Making the First Call.=—There are some pertinent points to consider\r\nregarding the procedure at the time the call is received. Many\r\nembalmers have some particular rules that govern their inquiries at\r\nthis time. It is the consensus of opinion among professional men of\r\nall kinds that a rule is a good thing to have to cover any regular\r\nprocedure. It matters not so much as to what the rule is, just so\r\nthe necessary information can be acquired in a uniform manner, thus\r\nsystematizing that part of the work and enabling the embalmer to\r\nproperly prepare for the case at hand before leaving the establishment.\r\n\r\nThe habit of inquiring about the sex, and age of the person, as well as\r\nthe cause of death, should be cultivated. The importance of knowing the\r\nsex of the person lies in the fact that in some communities different\r\nstyles of door badges or decorations are more appropriate for one sex\r\nthan for the other. When the ruling decoration is some form of fresh\r\nflowers, this should be ordered before the embalmer leaves for the\r\nhouse of mourning if possible, unless the call should be received at\r\nnight or in the early hours of the morning, when this item is usually\r\nleft until the earliest business hour. The age of the person also\r\ndetermines to a great extent the style of decoration which is to be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe cause of death is vitally necessary. In some cases, the ordinary\r\ncontents of the embalmer's grip or hand bag are sufficient for the\r\nusual needs. In other cases, extra material of various kinds are\r\nnecessary, for instance, the rubber floor covering for the carpet in\r\ndropsical cases; the sanitary clothes in eruptive contagious diseases;\r\nthe fumigating outfit in the same diseases, (providing this duty is not\r\nperformed by the health authorities); and other articles needed only in\r\nthe treatment of special cases.\r\n\r\nAfter obtaining the above information, examine your grip or hand bag\r\nto see that you have all the equipment needed to care for the case in\r\nthe proper manner. This saves many cases for those who follow these\r\nrules, as they are enabled to have just what is needed, and prevents\r\nthe slighting of a case for which there may be some excuse if the\r\nproper materials are not in the outfit. From a professional standpoint,\r\nit should be necessary for the embalmer to carry anything he may need,\r\notherwise carelessness may dictate his procedure and disaster may\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary case can be attended with the following material[1]:—\r\n\r\n   [1] NOTE—Many embalmers get along, some way, with much less in\r\n   their outfit than enumerated here. The authors believe that the\r\n   embalmer should have all the material needed to properly carry\r\n   out his work, and anything of necessity left from the outfit only\r\n   reduces the efficiency of the embalmer, and leaves him, at times,\r\n   without the proper assortment of material.\r\n\r\n  The couch embalming board.\r\n  The slumber robe, and face cover.\r\n  A rubber or oil cloth cover for the board.\r\n  A suit case grip, or hand bag.\r\n  Concentrated fluid (at least 4 bottles).\r\n  One or two empty 64-oz. bottles (for mixing fluid).\r\n  One bottle for blood drainage.\r\n  One injecting outfit (pump, tubes, etc.)\r\n  One blood drainage outfit.\r\n  One instrument wallet, containing:—\r\n     2 scalpels, 1 bone separator, 2 aneurism needles,\r\n     1 spool linen thread, 1 grooved director, 3 arterial\r\n     tubes (assorted diameters), 1 bistoury, 1 lock forceps,\r\n     1 spring forceps, 1 artery forceps, 1 case\r\n     needles, 1 6-inch child's trocar, 1 12 or 14-inch trocar,\r\n     1 chin rest, 1 hypodermic outfit, 1 roll absorbent\r\n     cotton, 1 sponge, 1 box face powder, 1 nail\r\n     file, 1 hair brush, 1 bottle bichloride of mercury\r\n     tablets, 1 shaving outfit.\r\n\r\nFor special cases it would be well to have on hand the following\r\narticles:—\r\n\r\n  1 small can plaster of paris.\r\n  1 tube lip cement.\r\n  2 rubber bandages.\r\n  1 can hardening compound.\r\n  1 bottle Platt's chlorides or any other good deodorant.\r\n  1 outfit of formalin and permanganate of potash, or\r\n    any other standard gaseous germicide preparation for\r\n    fumigating.\r\n  1 small bottle of tincture of iodine as a preventive to\r\n    infection should you cut yourself.\r\n\r\nAfter the outfit has been found correct for the case at hand, place\r\neverything in the conveyance, and leave for the house. Upon arriving\r\nat the house, enter alone and meet the member or members of the family\r\nwho have been delegated to talk to you. At this time it will be well\r\nto ascertain the position of the body, the wishes of the family in\r\nreference to where the body is to be placed after embalming and to\r\nwhere the body is to rest in the casket until the time of the funeral.\r\n\r\nIf you meet with any objection as to embalming, it will be well for\r\nyou to consider the sanitary aspect of the case in speaking to those\r\ninterested. In this case the sanitary aspect should always take\r\nprecedence over the preservative aspect, since you can count on the\r\nassistance of the physicians in supporting embalming on that account.\r\nShould your wishes be overruled after you have presented the facts in\r\nthe matter, it would be well for you to place the entire responsibility\r\nfor the condition of the body upon the family, since without embalming\r\nyou are unable to know the final condition of the body, and should not\r\nbe held responsible for it regardless of what the condition may be in\r\nthat case.\r\n\r\nAfter this short talk with the family, return to your conveyance and\r\ncarry your outfit to the room of death. Everything that you carry\r\nshould be properly covered, as there is nothing quite as indecorous\r\nas the display of an embalming board without a cover. When you have\r\nplaced the outfit in the room, call for everything that you will need\r\nfrom the family, which will include such things as a pail, warm water,\r\nsoap, towels, etc. Do all of this before touching the body; and after\r\nsecuring all the necessary items, close the door, and do not open it\r\nagain until the work has been completed.\r\n\r\nShould unforeseen circumstances cause you to re-open the door,\r\npresent yourself with a coat on, and never, under any circumstances,\r\nappear before any one in your shirt sleeves, as that is another\r\nindecorous procedure. After the preservation has been completed,\r\ndust a little face powder on the face and hands, to remove the moist,\r\nclammy appearance which may have been left on those parts. Place the\r\nundergarments on the body and then any other garments which may have\r\nbeen given to you by the family. Cover the body with the slumber robe,\r\nand then call in as many members of the family as may wish to view the\r\nbody, asking them to criticize your work. Before calling in the family\r\nit would be well to put everything out of sight and not have any grips\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nIf favorable comment is heard from the family, your work is done for\r\nthe time being. If unfavorable comment is heard, ascertain the cause\r\nof the comment and do not leave the house until the proper appearance\r\nhas been secured. If your work has been pleasing to the family, you can\r\nrest assured that the case is a success and that you have done your\r\nwork well. When you are satisfied in your own mind that all is well\r\nwith the body, make arrangements for the selection of the casket, and\r\nthen retire from the house. If the door decoration has not been placed\r\nin position before you leave, you will place it in position yourself.\r\n\r\nSome funeral directors set the time for the funeral during the first\r\ncall, and some wait until later. The same for the other arrangements,\r\nsuch as newspaper notices, minister, singers, church or chapel\r\nservices, number of conveyances, etc. Whatever method you choose to\r\nuse in your community should be carried out systematically so that\r\nat no time, will anything be left undone to cause confusion at some\r\ninopportune time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Position of the Body on the Embalming Board.=—The position of\r\nthe body on the embalming board is regulated by the adjustment of the\r\nmovable head end of the board.\r\n\r\nAfter much experience with various classes of bodies, we find that\r\nthe adjustment mentioned is a very valuable aid in securing the best\r\nresults both as to completeness of the circulation and amount of blood\r\ndrained.\r\n\r\nIn anemic, tubercular, cancer of the stomach and exhaustion cases,\r\ntogether with other conditions resulting in emaciation, the head end\r\nof the board should be raised to the height that seems suitable for the\r\nposition of the upper part of the body when placed in the casket during\r\nthe injection of the first bottle of fluid. When the first bottle of\r\nfluid has been injected, lower the head end of the board until the\r\nentire board is level, and leave it in that position until you have\r\ncompleted the injection, when you will again raise the end of the board\r\nuntil the position of the body is just as it will be in the casket.\r\n\r\nWhen pneumonia and other non-emaciated bodies are to be injected, with\r\ndrainage, use the same procedure as is stated above for the emaciated\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nIn dropsical cases, raise the head end of the board only for the first\r\nbottle of the injection; then for the second bottle, lower the head end\r\nto about half of its first height, and set the foot end of the board\r\non some object that will raise it five and six inches. In this way you\r\nwill have a slight elevation at both ends of the body, and drainage\r\ncan better be obtained from the center of the circulation. When the\r\noperation is complete, lower the foot end again and raise the head end\r\nso that the body occupies the proper position for the casket.\r\n\r\nThese adjustments are practical methods of overcoming gravity handicaps\r\nin the distribution of the fluid, and of accelerating the amount of\r\ndrainage obtainable by keeping the level of the drainage tube below the\r\nblood level in the body, thus accomplishing a universal distribution\r\nof fluid, and securing a greater quantity of undiluted blood from the\r\nvein.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to remember when you are through injecting the\r\nbody that you are to place the body in the exact position on the\r\ncooling board which you want it to have in the casket. After a little\r\ntime the body will become more or less rigid due to the action of the\r\npreservative fluid used, and will set in the position you have placed\r\nit which condition will be hard to change later.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Selection of an Artery.=—Great care should be taken in the selection\r\nof an artery. Never make a practice of using the same artery on\r\nall cases. Acquaint yourself with the location of them all, and on\r\ndifferent occasions, as different conditions arise, use the artery most\r\nlikely to give the best results for the condition in hand.\r\n\r\nConvenience usually governs the operator as to the artery he is to\r\nuse. If blood is to be removed it is best to raise one of the larger\r\nblood vessels, such as the carotid artery and the internal jugular\r\nvein, or the femoral artery and femoral vein, or the axillary artery\r\nand axillary vein. If it is desired to draw the maximum amount of\r\nblood, the femoral artery and vein should be selected, as they are more\r\ndependent, and control more of the blood, when the body is placed on\r\nan incline. A drainage tube sufficiently long to reach above Poupart's\r\nligament as far as the common iliac is all that is necessary as there\r\nare no valves intervening between the bifurcation of the common iliac\r\nand the right auricle. However if you can, extend the tube up through\r\nthe ascending vena cava and eustachian valve into the right auricle.\r\nThis will give you a chance to draw blood from the right auricle and is\r\na much better procedure than tapping the right auricle with the trocar.\r\n\r\nIf the body is already dressed and the hands or feet need to be\r\nre-injected, the radial or posterior tibial likely will be most\r\nconvenient as their use will not necessitate the removal or cutting of\r\nthe clothing.\r\n\r\nOftimes there is but a single window to admit light and the operator\r\nshould be so skilled as to be able to raise the arteries either on the\r\nright or left side without having to turn the cooling board.\r\n\r\nIn emaciated subjects the linear and anatomical guides are always\r\nplain but in fleshy subjects this is not always the case. Look over\r\nthe subject and see which artery will be the most convenient to raise.\r\nUsually in fleshy subjects the femoral is hard to raise as there is\r\na great amount of fat in Scarpa's triangle making the artery lie very\r\ndeep, but in these subjects the guide for the brachial is quite plain,\r\na distinct groove being seen between the biceps and triceps muscles.\r\n\r\nIn a short necked subject it is never advisable or convenient to raise\r\nthe carotid as there is not much room to work and the incision is very\r\nliable to show. Another artery will be found much more advantageous in\r\nthese subjects.\r\n\r\nIn accident cases the seat of injury will determine the artery to be\r\nraised, using the one through which you can give the body the greatest\r\nsupply of fluid to all parts. Often it will be necessary to raise\r\nseveral arteries to complete the injection.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity for undue exposure in either sex, however it is\r\nhardly ever advisable to inject the femoral in the female, as some\r\nmischief-maker might without any real cause influence others in the\r\ncommunity against your methods.\r\n\r\nWhen selecting the brachial and femoral arteries always raise them at\r\na place below the point where collateral circulation is given off or in\r\nother words raise them in the middle third. By so doing the fluid will\r\nreach, by means of collateral circulation, the tissues of the arm and\r\nleg below the point of injection.\r\n\r\nAs far as the injection of fluid is concerned, one artery is just as\r\ngood as another. All arteries are parts of the same channel branches of\r\nthe aorta. No valves exist in any part of their course.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Raise an Artery.=—With the scalpel make an incision an inch\r\nlong in the average size arm, cutting through the skin and then through\r\nthe fat. Reverse the blade and at each end of the wound cut forward\r\nand upward to make it clean. Take the grooved director and with the\r\nsmall end puncture the deep fascia, then reverse ends of the director\r\nand force the blunt end up the wound, underneath this deep fascia,\r\none-fourth to one-half an inch longer than the wound. Now take the\r\nscalpel with the edge of the blade upward and split the fascia as far\r\nup as the needle extends and cut the tissue (fascia and fat) up to the\r\nskin, being careful not to cut the skin. Reverse the needle and cut the\r\nlower end of the wound the same way. This will give you an incision one\r\ninch long on top and one and one-half or two inches at the bottom of\r\nthe wound, and none of the vessels will be injured.\r\n\r\nWith the handle of the aneurism needle separate the tissues between the\r\nmuscles, artery, vein and nerve, then use the hook end of the aneurism\r\nneedle, pass it under the artery and raise it to the surface, passing\r\nthe bone separator or the forceps with the closed end underneath.\r\nRemove the individual sheath surrounding the artery. Likewise raise the\r\nvein to the surface.\r\n\r\nIf the artery and vein lie side by side and it is desired only to raise\r\nthe artery, hook down between the two, away from the vein, sliding\r\nthe hook forward and backward underneath the artery, then raise to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIf the artery and vein lie side by side and it is desired to raise\r\nboth, pass the hook around the vein first, as by hooking around the\r\nartery toward the vein the point of the hook will often rupture the\r\nvein.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to tell an Artery from a Vein or a Nerve.=—Raise the suspected\r\nvessels to the surface, placing a bone separator underneath to form a\r\nbridge, which will cause the blood to recede on every side. If you are\r\nin doubt which is the artery, remove the individual sheath from each\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe nerve will appear as a glistening white cord, very solid to the\r\ntouch and showing bands of nerve fibres which can be separated by the\r\naneurism hook. It will not have any central opening.\r\n\r\nThe vein will appear as a dark blue color and collapsible because of\r\nthe fact that they have thinner walls than the arteries, lacking the\r\nmiddle circular layer of fibres. Veins have a central opening. As a\r\nrule the vein contains blood after death, which gives it the dark blue\r\ncolor but should it not contain blood, it resembles the artery very\r\nclosely as to color.\r\n\r\nThe vein contains valves which can be seen distinctly, if the blood be\r\npushed the opposite way from which it runs in life.\r\n\r\nThe artery is of a creamish white color and non-collapsible because of\r\nthe fact that it has heavy walls and a middle circular layer of fibres.\r\nThe arteries feel firm to the touch while the veins are soft and\r\nvelvety. Arteries have a central opening and as a rule do not contain\r\nblood after death. They likewise do not have valves. The artery is\r\nusually more constant than the vein.\r\n\r\nShould all these not convince you, raise the one you think is the\r\nartery with the hook, pass the forceps underneath, spread these and\r\npass the bone separator under for a bridge and with the scalpel incise\r\nthe artery about one-fourth the way. Attach the arterial tube and if\r\nthere is blood present, allow it to drain by lowering the arm. When\r\nit has ceased to flow, inject very gently and slowly. If you get a\r\nhalf-pint of fluid in the body, you may be assured of its being the\r\nartery.\r\n\r\nAnother way to tell the artery from the vein is to roll them lightly\r\nbetween the fingers. If it feels like a thin rubber tube, and does not\r\nroll together in a little bundle, the supposition is that the vessel\r\nis an artery. This however is not certain, as phlebitis, or some other\r\ndiseased condition of the veins may result in the thickening of the\r\nwalls of those vessels, to such an extent as to make it impossible to\r\ndistinguish in this way between the artery and the vein.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical and the linear guides for the arteries and veins, and\r\ntheir relation to the accompanying nerve, will help also to tell them,\r\none from the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Cut an Artery for Injection.=—After the artery has been located\r\nit should be freed from the surrounding tissues and then raised to the\r\nsurface. After it has been raised to the surface the bone separator\r\nwhich is to act as a support while cutting the artery, should be placed\r\nunderneath the artery.\r\n\r\nThe artery may be cut in several ways as follows—a T shaped incision\r\nmay be made. This is a very old method, one of the first to be used\r\nfor this purpose. To make this kind of an incision in the artery, the\r\nscalpel is placed point down about one-fourth the distance from the\r\nedge of the artery, and then by forcibly bearing down on the scalpel\r\ncut the artery crosswise. Rotating the artery the cut will now be on\r\nthe upper surface. Now from the middle of the crosswise cut, extend a\r\nlongitudinal cut lengthwise of the artery, for almost one half inch.\r\nWe have no comment to make on this kind of an incision, excepting to\r\nsay that the method is old and obsolete, and no longer used, and that\r\na much better method is now used.\r\n\r\nAnother method suggested by some authors is the longitudinal incision.\r\nWith the belly of the scalpel cut the artery lengthwise for a distance\r\nof a little less than one half inch. The disadvantage of this kind of\r\na cut is that the operator does not know when he has cut to the center\r\nof the artery and no more than the center. If the cut has been made to\r\na distance beyond the center, then the inside wall on the opposite side\r\nwill be cut and if the wall is in the least diseased, the arterial tube\r\nwhen it is inserted may get between the walls which will mean that no\r\nfluid can be injected.\r\n\r\nAnother method is to cut the artery crosswise, placing the point of the\r\nknife on the artery about one fourth the distance from the edge of the\r\nartery, bearing down so that the point will come through to the bone\r\nseparator which is beneath, then forcibly bearing down cut outward with\r\nthe belly of the knife. Now rotate the artery and the cut will be on\r\nthe front of the artery.\r\n\r\nAnother better method is the same as the above, but instead of cutting\r\noutward perpendicular to the artery, cut outward diagonally, then when\r\nthe artery is rotated there will be a V—shaped cut. The point of the V\r\nshould be made opposite the way the operator is to inject the fluid.\r\nWith the aneurism hook, pick up the point of the V, which will mean\r\nthat the hook will have to be inside of the artery, and using the hook\r\nas a guide insert the arterial tube. The only disadvantage of this\r\nmethod is that the tensil strength of the artery is to a certain extent\r\nweakened, but if the artery is not cut too deep, this is not a serious\r\ndisadvantage. The advantage is that the operator is always certain that\r\nhe is in the center of the artery, that if his knife is sharp, that he\r\nwill always cut all three walls of the artery at once, and thus prevent\r\na ruffling up of the inner wall of the artery should it be diseased.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Injection of Fluid.=—One very important point to be taken into\r\nconsideration when embalming, is the slowness with which the fluid\r\nshould be injected.\r\n\r\nUpon this one thing will depend very largely the success you will have\r\nwith the perfect circulation of the fluid and cosmetic effects.\r\n\r\nSome authorities on the art and science of embalming have made the\r\nclaim that it makes no difference how rapidly a body is injected as the\r\nfluid is so widely distributed through so many branches of the artery\r\nthat no harm can come from this source. This is very erroneous for when\r\nthe fluid is forced rapidly through the arteries, it also flows rapidly\r\nthrough the capillaries into the veins, thereby enlarging the quantity\r\nof fluid in those vessels and often forcing the blood into the exposed\r\nparts of the body, causing serious discolorations.\r\n\r\nThe capillaries are sometimes ruptured by the rapid injection of fluid,\r\ncausing spots to appear on the face that would never have been there\r\nhad the body been injected more slowly.\r\n\r\nA further reason for slow injection is that the disinfecting fluid is\r\ngiven an opportunity to be absorbed by the tissues as it passes into\r\nthe capillaries and not be forced through those little vessels into\r\nthe veins, as it is by the absorption of the fluid that the body is\r\ndisinfected. This is especially true when the drainage tube is being\r\nused as the fluid, seeking the course of least resistance, passes\r\nthrough the artery, into the capillaries, through those vessels to the\r\nveins and out through the drainage tube.\r\n\r\nAs it takes but little blood to color a large quantity of embalming\r\nfluid, many embalmers are led to believe that they are removing large\r\nquantities of blood, while in reality perhaps one-half of the colored\r\nliquid which flows from their drainage tube is the fluid which is being\r\ninjected. Many failures have resulted from this error.\r\n\r\nFluid should always be injected into the body very slowly, and the more\r\nslowly it is injected the more perfect will be the cosmetic effect.\r\n\r\nIf necessary make a second injection. An embalmer who makes the\r\nproper charge for his services as a professional can afford to make\r\ntwo injections if necessary. He can let it be known that he will\r\nnot be content with anything but perfect work, and patrons will not\r\nonly cheerfully pay for it, but will have a better opinion of his\r\nprofessional standing. Thorough drainage and slow injection are the\r\nbest safeguards against discoloration.\r\n\r\nDr. Erdman before the Minnesota association suggests that the amount of\r\nfluid that fills the arteries is not enough to percolate through the\r\ncapillaries and into the tissues, and saturate all the parts of the\r\nbody. He favors the gravity injection by merely allowing the fluid to\r\nflow naturally into the arteries from an elevated vessel, and would use\r\nno force or pressure in injection. Ideal embalming would be a series\r\nof gravity injections at intervals of several hours. While the gravity\r\ninjection such as the doctor describes will undoubtedly be a sure\r\nmethod of getting a perfect circulation, and while it is the process\r\ngenerally pursued in morgue work where the apparatus is convenient, it\r\nis in the majority of cases in the home impractical.\r\n\r\nAll bodies to be shipped must be thoroughly arterially embalmed, that\r\nis, to have introduced into the arterial system sufficient amount of\r\ndisinfecting fluid to thoroughly sterilize every particle of matter in\r\nthe dead body. This can only be done by introducing into the arteries\r\nan approved disinfecting fluid.[2]\r\n\r\n   [2] The quantity to be injected of course varies, but a fair\r\n   estimate would be that the quantity should be three-fourths of\r\n   the capacity of the blood vessels of the body. This would require\r\n   approximately one and one-eighth gallons of fluid to every 150\r\n   pounds of tissue. The latest transportation rules demand the\r\n   injection of an amount of fluid equal to 10% of the body weight\r\n   into the arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Approved Disinfectants.=—This is construed by most states to mean a\r\nfluid which is sufficient in strength to kill all the germs on the\r\nsurface of the body or on the interior. An approved disinfectant\r\nfor the external surface of a dead body is a solution of 1 : 1000\r\nbichloride of mercury. An embalming fluid which has the official\r\napproval should contain 5% formaldehyde.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Embalming Fluids.=—At the present time only a few states have placed\r\nrestrictions on fluids. These restrictions are that they contain\r\nneither mercury, arsenic, antimony or any of their compounds. These\r\npoisons when used to inject a body make it almost impossible to detect\r\nfrom a chemical analysis whether death was caused by a poison or\r\nthe poison was from the embalming fluid. Iowa recommends a fluid the\r\nformula consisting of formaldehyde, glycerine, borax, boracic acid,\r\nsalt petre and water.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wrapping a Body in Cotton.=—In certain diseases, when a body is to be\r\nshipped, the law compels the embalmer to wrap the body in cotton. This\r\nmay be the ordinary cotton purchased from a dry goods store. The cotton\r\nshould be cut in strips at least one to one and one-half feet longer\r\nthan the body. Two layers are laid side by side upon a sheet, the body\r\nthen placed thereon and the whole wrapped about the body will envelope\r\nthe body in a satisfactory manner. This means that the entire body is\r\nto be enveloped, so that the face head or feet will not be exposed, and\r\nthe wrapping should never be removed. Absorbent cotton may be used for\r\nthis work, but it is more expensive and not as good as dry cotton for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n=[3]The Charge of Embalming.=—This subject is one that has\r\nlong been forcing itself upon the thought and attention of\r\nprogressive undertakers, principally because of the many abuses and\r\nmisunderstandings that have grown out of the manner in which members of\r\nthe profession regard the value of their services and the careless and\r\nindifferent systems used in conducting the business side of our work.\r\n\r\n   [3] Extracts from a paper written by F. W. Alexander, Conrad,\r\n   Iowa.\r\n\r\nIn order to succeed in a chosen calling one must first have a liking\r\nand a natural adaptation for the work; second, he must prepare himself\r\nby obtaining a thorough working knowledge of the profession or business\r\nhe expects to follow. He must educate himself for the work. This is\r\nfundamental and has been proven many times with the successes in every\r\nprofession. It is fair to presume then that the great majority of men\r\nentering this profession have considered the probabilities of success\r\nand have met the requirements needed to qualify them to follow this\r\ncalling and to receive the support of any who through necessity need\r\ntheir services.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the non-essentials showing the rights of individuals\r\nholding a license as an embalmer to practice, we may naturally come to\r\nthe next question in this connection, the value of his services and\r\nhow they should be charged for. Charge what your work is worth,\r\nand do not conceal the amount in the price made on the casket or any\r\nother part of the funeral expenses. Make it a specific charge in every\r\ninstance for there is a good and sufficient reason why you should.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of these reasons may be summed up as follows: the\r\nconscientious effort in qualifying yourself to meet the needs of your\r\ncalling and the requirements of the state, the cost of your training\r\nand education in time and money, the years spent in the hard school of\r\npractical experience and self development.\r\n\r\nNext your business equipment and investment, the care of the case on\r\nwhich you are called, its peculiar requirements and how it taxes your\r\nskill in doing the work, the risk from infection, the distance you must\r\ntravel and the expense of the trip. All of these considerations enter\r\ninto the cost and should be the basis on which to formulate a charge\r\nfor the work.\r\n\r\nJust as the well equipped surgeon of wide experience and training\r\nskillfully performs operations relieving suffering, saving and\r\nprolonging life, naturally allows the difficulties of the case and\r\nthe distinctive personal service rendered to govern him in the amount\r\nof the fee, so in a very similar sense the services of the embalmer\r\nshould hold a certain ratio of value to the conditions under which he\r\nworks and the ability he employs in its performance. Therefore let me\r\nagain urge that you make it a specific charge showing it a distinctive\r\npersonal service.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the value of personal services the question is\r\noften raised: “Which is the more important part of the work in our\r\nprofession, directing and managing the funeral or the embalming and\r\ncare of the body.” In answer to this let me say that the care and\r\nthe embalming of the body is first importance because the law says\r\nso, because the education of the embalmer is paramount to other\r\nconsiderations and so regarded by the national association, because\r\nsanitary science demands it, because without a body properly embalmed\r\nand prepared for burial the funeral is a failure from whatever\r\nstandpoint you wish to judge it.\r\n\r\nA director may bungle the arrangements and at the most it is but a\r\nmatter of annoyance to the family. However, let him fail to properly\r\nfit and prepare the body so that the relatives can see restored to\r\nthem the face of their beloved one, beautified in the last long sleep\r\nof death, and they will never forgive him. They secured his services\r\nfirst as an embalmer and incidentally as a director of the funeral,\r\nnaturally, therefore, the greater importance of his work centers around\r\nhis services to the family in that capacity. Now in all candor, why\r\nshould he not make a specific charge for his work? He is rendering the\r\ngreater service in caring for the body, it should be the first item\r\ncharged for on the funeral bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE ANATOMICAL AND LINEAR GUIDES FOR SPECIAL ARTERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Locate and Inject the Carotid Artery.=—The carotid artery,\r\nis not used much, by the average embalmer for several reasons. It is\r\nusually a hard artery to raise, partly because the average embalmer\r\ndoes not know the anatomy of the neck. In subjects having short and\r\nvery fleshy necks it is not advisable to use the carotid, however in\r\nsubjects where the neck is long and not fat it is with some a favorite.\r\nIt is always essential to know how to raise and inject the carotid for\r\nin accident cases, where the arteries of the lower part of the neck\r\nand thorax are ruptured it becomes necessary to raise and inject the\r\ncarotids to get the fluid into the tissues of the face and brain. In\r\ncases of suicide where the arteries of the neck have been cut it is\r\nnecessary to know where the arteries and veins lie so that they may be\r\ntied off. Often the body is so badly mutilated that it is impossible to\r\nraise any other artery excepting the carotid. Every practitioner should\r\nknow how to raise and inject this artery, even though some other artery\r\nis the one generally used.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 46—The arteries of the neck. (Gray)]\r\n\r\n_Linear Guide._—By a linear guide is meant that an imaginary line is\r\ndrawn from a point to a point the same direction the artery runs so\r\nthat by mentally imagining this line one can be safe to cut on the line\r\nand be sure that the desired artery will be reached.\r\n\r\nThe linear guide for the carotid is represented by a line drawn from\r\nthe sterno-clavicular junction to a point between the angle of the jaw\r\nand the lobe of the ear. (Mastoid process).\r\n\r\nAs the body lies on the cooling-board place one finger on the\r\nsterno-clavicular junction and the other at a point between the angle\r\nof the jaw and the lobe of the ear, and by cutting on this imaginary\r\nline, the artery will be reached, providing the artery is normal and\r\nif the embalmer is thoroughly acquainted with the anatomy about the\r\nartery, as is summed up in the anatomical guide.\r\n\r\n_Anatomical Guide._—By the anatomical guide is meant the relation which\r\nthe artery bears to the surrounding tissues.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical guide for the carotid artery is that the artery lies\r\nbetween the sterno-mastoid muscle to the outside, and the muscles\r\nsurrounding the trachea (wind pipe) and the esophagus, to the inside.\r\nIn the middle third or sometimes between the middle and upper third the\r\nomohyoid muscle crosses over the artery.\r\n\r\n_Perpendicular Incision._—The artery is divided for the sake of\r\ndescription into thirds. By making an incision on the linear guide in\r\nany one of the thirds the tissues that must be passed through are the\r\nfollowing:—skin, platysma muscle, superficial fascia, deep fascia,\r\ncommon sheath, and the individual sheath.\r\n\r\nThe platysma muscle is a broad tissue paper like muscle, placed\r\nimmediately beneath the skin and a part of the superficial fascia,\r\nin the cervicle or neck region. It arises by thin fibrous bands from\r\nthe fascia covering the pectoral and deltoid muscles on the thoracic\r\nwall, and passes upward over the clavicle and inserts the lower jaw.\r\nThis muscle is so delicate and the fibers so finely divided that it is\r\nhardly perceptible. When the skin is cut, the platysma muscle will as\r\na rule be cut too, and because of its thinness it will rarely be seen\r\nor does it form any hindrance to the raising of the artery. It is only\r\nmentioned here because it forms part of one of the questions so often\r\nasked by the State Board in their examination: “What tissues would you\r\npass through in raising the carotid artery?”\r\n\r\nHaving cut through the skin and platysma muscle, the superficial fascia\r\nis next seen. In this part of the body it consists of but a single\r\nlayer and very thin.\r\n\r\nThe deep fascia lies next and constitutes a complete investment of the\r\nneck. When this is torn or cut through the sternomastoid muscle comes\r\ninto view.\r\n\r\nThe sternomastoid, is a large, thick muscle, which passes obliquely\r\nacross the side of the neck, being inclosed between two layers of deep\r\nfascia. It has its origin at the sternum and clavicle and attaches to\r\nthe mastoid process of the temporal bone. By making the perpendicular\r\nincision in the lower third, in as much as the muscle slightly covers\r\nthe artery, it can either be cut or pushed to the outside of the\r\nincision. It is best to push the muscle to the outside with the thumb,\r\nand with the handle of the scalpel, work down deep through the areolar\r\ntissue. The operator will now arrive at the common sheath, or that part\r\nof the deep fascia surrounding the artery, vein and nerve. The common\r\nsheath will be very tough and a slit must first be cut, then it can be\r\ntorn the length of the incision.\r\n\r\nThe artery will now be seen lying next to the wind pipe and the\r\ninternal jugular vein to the outside. In the lower third the artery\r\nwill be about one-half inch deep, while in the upper third it will\r\nbe about one to two inches deep, owing to the amount of fat in this\r\nregion. In the upper third, the omohyoid muscle crosses over the\r\nartery, which must be either pushed aside or cut in two.\r\n\r\nIt is always advisable, to raise this artery in the lower third, as it\r\nis less apt to show in that third.\r\n\r\nLoosen the artery well from the surrounding tissues with the aneurism\r\nhook, raise to the surface and place a bone separator beneath the\r\nartery.\r\n\r\nNow remove the individual sheath, incise the artery and insert the\r\narterial tube.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to raise the internal jugular vein for the withdrawal\r\nof blood, it is best not to open up the common sheath, but to raise the\r\nartery and the vein both at the same time. Having raised them to the\r\nsurface they can then be separated by the removal of the common sheath\r\nand dropping it back into the incision.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired only to raise the carotid, the hook should always\r\nbe inserted between the artery and the vein, and directed toward the\r\ntrachea. If it is directed around the artery in the other direction\r\nthere is danger of rupturing the vein, and thus getting a bloody\r\nincision.\r\n\r\n_The Circular Incision._—In the circular incision as much of the skin\r\nas can be, is pushed above the clavical bone from off the chest wall.\r\nThe cut is then made from one sterno-clavicular junction to the other\r\nfollowing the supra-sternal notch. This method was devised for the use\r\nof the “Y” shaped tube, where both sides of the face could be injected\r\nat the same time. One precaution however should be noted, which is,\r\nthat care should be taken that not more than the skin, be incised with\r\nthe first cut. Just below the incision will be noticed a little branch\r\nvein which runs into the arch connecting the two external jugular\r\nveins. If the first cut is too deep this branch will be cut, and a flow\r\nof blood will result. However by cutting carefully this little branch\r\ncan be noticed, tied off in two places and cut in between, and thus\r\ncause no further trouble. Remembering the linear guide, the artery can\r\nbe reached by going down at either end of the incision. The tissues to\r\ngo through will be the same as for the perpendicular incision, and the\r\nmethod of raising the artery will be the same, only, in the circular\r\nincision usually both carotids are raised, so as to inject both sides\r\nof the face at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe only advantages derived from the circular incision is that one can\r\nby the use of the “Y” shaped tube inject both sides of the face at the\r\nsame time and get an equal distribution of fluid, and that after the\r\ninjection is over, and the incision sewed up, the skin can be pulled\r\nback in place, making the incision appear much below the clavical, and\r\nwhere it is less liable to show than in the perpendicular incision.\r\n\r\nFor embalming female subjects, if the carotid is chosen as the artery\r\nto use, it will be best to use the circular incision. However for\r\nordinary embalming it will perhaps be best to choose some other artery,\r\nwhich will be less apt to show, and not so deep.\r\n\r\nWe should be so skilled as to never make a mistake, but the best\r\nsometimes do make mistakes. If in raising another artery, a mistake\r\nshould occur, the operator can raise either above or below the original\r\ncut, but with the carotid, the only advisable incision to make is in\r\nthe lower third, and if a mistake is made the last chance is lost. For\r\nthis reason then a great amount of care should be taken.\r\n\r\nIn injecting the body from the carotid, the arterial tube should be\r\ninserted first toward the heart, and after the body has received a\r\nsufficient amount of fluid, if it is noticed that the side of the face\r\nfrom which you are injecting has not received a supply of fluid, then\r\nreverse the tube and inject a few bulbs of fluid upward.\r\n\r\n_Relation of Artery, Vein and Nerve._—The common carotid artery lies in\r\nrelation to the internal jugular vein and the pneumogastric nerve. The\r\nartery lies to the inside next to the muscles surrounding the trachea\r\n(windpipe). The internal jugular artery lies to the outside of the\r\nartery. Just back of the common carotid artery and the internal jugular\r\nvein and between the two lies the pneumogastric (vagus) nerve. These\r\nall as a rule lie in the same common sheath of deep fascia.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Locate and Inject the Axillary Artery.=—The axillary in recent\r\nyears has come to be a much used artery. It not quite as large as\r\nthe common carotid, but as a rule large enough to admit the large\r\nsize arterial tube. It has become a favorite with many because it is\r\nquite easy to locate and to raise, and because of its proximity to\r\nthe axillary vein, a vein which is large enough to admit a drainage\r\ntube for the withdrawal of blood. Again the axillary artery is in a\r\nsecluded place, being as it is in the axillary space (arm pit). The\r\nartery does not lie very deep, and is not covered by any muscles as you\r\noperate, there being practically nothing to hinder the progress of the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 47—The axillary and its branches. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nThen after the operation is completed and the arm placed back in normal\r\nposition, the casual observer is not liable to see the incision, even\r\nthough the body be only partially dressed.\r\n\r\n_Linear Guide._—A line drawn through the center of the axillary space\r\n(arm pit), at the anterior border of the hair line.\r\n\r\n_The Axillary Space._—When the arm is maintained in a horizontal plane,\r\nthe axilla has the shape of a three-sided pyramid, the apex of which\r\nlies above, below the clavicle, and the base of which corresponds to\r\nthe lower wall, covered only by skin and fascia.\r\n\r\nThe axilla is filled with blood vessels, lymph vessels, lymph glands,\r\nnerves, and masses of fat.\r\n\r\n_To Raise the Artery._—Make an incision on the linear guide. After\r\nthe skin is passed through there is a large quantity of fascia, lymph\r\nglands, and lymph vessels, which must be carefully dissected through,\r\nand at the same time the axillary vein will be discovered. This vein,\r\nfor the present, should not be loosened from the surrounding tissues.\r\nDissect down to the upper side of the vein, and the common sheath of\r\nfascia surrounding the artery and nerves will be seen. By carefully\r\ntearing this the length of the incision, the brachial plexus of nerves\r\nnow is exposed. Now by gently pushing the nerves apart with the handle\r\nof the scalpel, the artery will be seen. With a hook loosen the artery\r\nfrom the surrounding tissues and raise to the surface.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to draw blood, now proceed to raise the vein to the\r\nsurface. Open the vein and insert a drainage tube, which should be\r\nlong enough to reach through the entire length of the axillary and\r\nsubclavian veins, because they have valves along their entire course\r\nnearly to the bifurcation of the innominate.\r\n\r\nInject a few ounces of fluid toward the hand as the axillary is above\r\nthe point of collateral circulation. Then reverse the tube and inject\r\ntoward the heart, until a sufficient amount of fluid has been injected.\r\n\r\n_Relation of Artery, Vein and Nerve._—The vein is quite superficial,\r\njust below it and to the upper part of the incision is the brachial\r\nplexus of nerves, which surrounds the artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Locate, Raise, and Inject the Brachial Artery.=—The brachial\r\nartery is located in the upper arm and extends from the inferior margin\r\nof the muscle pectoralis major, or from the shoulder to the elbow. It\r\nis one of the most popular arteries known to the embalmer, and is now\r\nused, perhaps, more than all others combined.\r\n\r\nThe anatomy of this vessel is simple, yet, when we take into\r\nconsideration all the numerous anomalies or irregularities that\r\nsurround its use to us as embalmers, we feel the necessity of making\r\nthe description very thorough and complete, in order to raise it under\r\nall the various difficulties that attend its use.\r\n\r\nThe brachial artery has its several branches, the most prominent of\r\nwhich are the artery profunda brachii (superior profunda artery) and\r\nthe artery collateralis ulnaris superior (inferior profunda artery) and\r\nthe artery collateralis inferior (anastomotica magna artery).\r\n\r\nFor the sake of a more correct description we divide the artery into\r\nthirds, viz: the upper, middle and lower thirds. The upper third begins\r\nat the extreme upper part of the arm and extends one third of the way\r\nto the elbow, the middle and lower thirds occupy the remainder of the\r\nartery. In the upper third we have the superior and inferior profunda\r\narteries coming off; their position is not always the same, and in\r\nthe extreme lower third the anastomotica magna artery. These arteries\r\ncontinue down the outer and inner arm and anastomose with the recurrent\r\nradial and ulnar arteries, thus furnishing collateral circulation. Thus\r\nif the fluid is injected in the middle third, toward the heart, these\r\nbranches that come off the brachial in the upper third will convey the\r\nfluid down the arm, filling the branches below the point of injection,\r\nwhich supply the forearm and the hand.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 48—The brachial artery. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nThe brachial artery is one continuous vessel, the entire length of\r\nthe upper arm, and varies in size according to the size of the person\r\nand the development of the arm. It is accompanied by the venae comites\r\nor deep brachial veins, the one to the inner side of the artery about\r\none-third to one-half the size of the artery, the other about one-half\r\nits size lies directly underneath. All are encased in the same common\r\nsheath of deep fascia that surrounds and holds them together. Great\r\ncare, then, should be taken to separate the artery from these veins\r\nbefore cutting the artery for injection.\r\n\r\nThe artery lies along the inner and under border of the large muscle\r\non top of the arm known as the biceps. The biceps is the muscle used\r\nwhen lifting a weight. To those whose occupation is to exercise the\r\nmuscular tissue of the body liberally, this muscle becomes quite large,\r\nand generally the artery is proportionally large.\r\n\r\n_Linear Guide._—The course of the brachial artery may be marked out by\r\ndrawing a line from the middle of the axillary space (arm pit) to the\r\ncenter of the elbow, provided the palm of the hand be turned upward.\r\nThis line will be immediately over the artery, which will be found\r\nby cutting through the skin at any point on the line, and dissecting\r\nthrough the subcutaneous tissue toward the center of the arm.\r\n\r\n_The Anatomical Guide._—In the upper third the artery lies between the\r\nbiceps and coracobrachialis muscles which lie above the artery, and\r\nthe triceps muscle which lies below the artery. In the upper third the\r\nnerve lies close to the muscle, the artery below and to the inner side\r\ntoward the body, and the vein a little farther to the inside.\r\n\r\nIn the middle third the artery lies between the biceps which lies above\r\nthe artery, and the triceps muscle which lies below the artery. In the\r\nmiddle third the artery will lie beneath the nerve.\r\n\r\nIn the lower third the artery lies between the biceps which lies above\r\nthe artery, and the triceps which lies below the artery. In the lower\r\nthird the artery lies next to the muscle and the nerve to the inner\r\nside next to the body, and the vein still farther to the inner side.\r\n\r\n_How to Raise the Artery._—First trace the inner border of the biceps\r\nmuscle, feel for the median nerve, which will always be present. The\r\nartery in the middle and lower thirds will follow the border of the\r\nmuscle. The palm of the hand should always be turned upward, and the\r\nlinear guide, as stated above, will indicate the exact position of\r\nthe artery. Make an incision through the skin, on the linear guide,\r\npushing the fatty subcutaneous tissue to one side, if there be any, and\r\nwith the handle of the scalpel, work through the superficial fascia.\r\nReverse the blade, and at each end of the incision, cut forward and\r\nupward to make it clean. Now with the scalpel cautiously cut through\r\nthe deep fascia, and remove this from the vessels below. This will\r\nexpose to view the median nerve, and with the handle of the scalpel,\r\nseparate the tissue between the artery and the muscle, and between the\r\nartery and the nerve. Having thus freed the artery, use the hook end\r\nof the aneurism needle and pass it under the artery toward the muscle,\r\nand raise the artery to the surface. Pass the bone separator or the\r\nforceps with the closed end, underneath, remove the sheath surrounding\r\nthe artery and the deep brachial veins. The natural position will be,\r\nthe artery on top, the larger deep brachial vein to the inner side and\r\nthe smaller one underneath. It is very necessary to remove these deep\r\nbrachial veins, for the reason that if they are not, in cutting the\r\nartery for injection, they will be cut also, resulting in a flow of\r\nvenous blood into the incision.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Locate, Raise and Inject the Radial Artery.=—The radial artery\r\nis one of the branches of the brachial artery, and extends from about\r\none half inch below the bend of the elbow, along the valley of the\r\nforearm, to the thumb part of the hand. It is divided into thirds, viz:\r\nthe upper, middle and lower thirds. It is accompanied in close relation\r\nby the radial veins, but in no way do they interfere with the operation\r\nof raising the vessel. The value of this artery is in the embalming\r\nof ladies, where the body has been dressed and the sleeve cannot be\r\nremoved to use the brachial artery without material inconvenience and\r\nannoyance. It is especially desirable to those who are just beginning\r\nto use the arteries. The radial artery is somewhat smaller than the\r\nulnar, but, on account of the depth of the latter and inconvenience\r\nof raising, the radial artery is the one artery in the forearm which\r\nis generally used. It is an excellent vessel to employ in cases where\r\nthe friends are opposed to embalming because of the mutilation of the\r\nbody, as they choose to call it. Some object to the use of this artery\r\non account of the fact that the mutilation is not easily hidden. The\r\nwound can be easily covered by simply pulling the sleeve down to its\r\nnormal place. The incision necessary to be made is so small and it can\r\nbe closed so neatly, that no objection on the part of the relatives\r\nneed be apprehended.\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of formaldehyde fluids the radial artery offered more\r\nadvantages to the embalmer than any other artery used for injecting.\r\nBut at the present time almost all embalming fluids contain large\r\nquantities of formaldehyde, and when injected into this artery, which\r\nis very small, it is liable to constrict the vessel to such an extent\r\nas to sometimes make it difficult to inject the fluid.\r\n\r\nMoreover, since both the radial and the ulnar arteries have many\r\nbranches, a large quantity of fluid is liable to accumulate in the\r\nforearm, hardening it more than is necessary and giving the hand an\r\nundesirable color.\r\n\r\nThe radial artery is very superficially located, and can be secured\r\nwithout the possibility of error and with very little mutilation. The\r\nexpert will, of course, choose that vessel which he believes will at\r\nthe time and under the circumstances best serve his purpose.\r\n\r\n_The Linear Guide._—Is a line drawn from the center of the bend of the\r\nelbow to the center of the ball of the thumb.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 49—The radial and ulnar arteries. (Gray)]\r\n\r\n_The anatomical guide_ for the radial artery (in the wrist, where it\r\nshould be raised) is the brachio-radialis muscle on the outside of\r\nthe artery and the flexor carpi radialis muscle on the inside of the\r\nartery.\r\n\r\nWhen about to raise this vessel, the embalmer should hold the arm at\r\nright angles with the body, with the palm up, and holding the hand of\r\nthe body, with the hand, draw the arm tight. In most bodies this will\r\nshow plainly the tendons of the muscles between which the vessel lies,\r\nthus affording an excellent guide for the incision. The arm should\r\nnever be grasped and the tissues drawn out of their normal position,\r\nas that is very misleading. The vessel should be raised at a point\r\nabout three inches above the wrist joint (the space where you would\r\nfeel the pulse beat in life). The operator making an incision through\r\nthe skin, superficial fascia, and fat, about one-half inch in length,\r\nwill plainly see the artery lying in its sheath between the two tendons\r\nof the muscles. The cut should now be opened carefully, by placing the\r\nfingers on either side of it, and the fascia dissected from the artery,\r\nwhen it can easily be raised with the aneurism hook. There is no other\r\nvessel at this point that can be mistaken for the radial artery. Its\r\ntwo venae comites, or accompanying veins, are usually attached to the\r\nartery and need not be removed, as they are very small and can give the\r\nembalmer no trouble.\r\n\r\n=How to Locate, Raise and Inject the Ulnar Artery.=—The ulnar is the\r\nlarger branch of the brachial artery. It crosses obliquely the inner\r\nside of the forearm, to the beginning of its lower half, it then runs\r\nalong the ulnar border to the wrist, crosses the annular ligament on\r\nthe radial side of the pisiform bone (wrist bone), and immediately\r\nbeyond this bone into two branches, the superficial and deep palmar\r\narch. In its upper half it is deeply seated, being covered by all the\r\nsurface muscles. It is crossed by the median nerve, which lies to\r\nthe inner side for about an inch. In the lower half of the forearm\r\nthe artery runs more superficially, and is covered only by the skin\r\nand superficial and deep fascia, but at that, the ulnar lies a little\r\ndeeper in the wrist than the radial. The ulnar nerve lies to the inner\r\nside in the lower half and the ulnar artery is accompanied by two ulnar\r\nveins, one on either side, called the venae comites.\r\n\r\n_The Linear Guide._—Is a line drawn from the center of the bend of the\r\nelbow, to the inside of the pisiform bone in the wrist.\r\n\r\n_The Anatomical Guide._—The artery lies in a groove in the wrist,\r\nmade by the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle on the outside, and the flexor\r\ndigitorum sublimis on the inside.\r\n\r\nTo raise the ulnar artery, locate the valley in the lower third about\r\none to two inches above the pisiform bone. Make an incision about an\r\ninch in length, cutting first the skin, superficial fascia, layer of\r\nfat, which will vary in thickness. The deep fascia is now reached,\r\nwhich should be split by means of the fascia needle and bistoury. Then\r\nseparate with the handle of the knife or bone separator, the artery\r\nfrom its connective tissue on either side. Then with the hook raise it\r\nto the surface, and place the bone separator beneath, remove the hook,\r\nand tear off the individual sheath.\r\n\r\nThe two ulnar veins will be separated from the artery by taking away\r\nthe individual sheath, which should be allowed to drop back into the\r\nincision. Proceed now to open and inject the artery the same as you\r\nwould the radial or the brachial. While this artery may seem just a\r\nlittle more difficult to raise, still at times it has its place in\r\narterial embalming.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Locate, Raise and Inject the Femoral Artery.=—The femoral\r\nartery is usually objected to, because, situated as it is, it requires\r\nan undue exposure of the limb, especially in ladies. For this reason,\r\nthen, the femoral artery should never be raised in the female,\r\nexcepting in accidental case when it is impossible to raise any other\r\nartery. In the male, however, the femoral with many is a favorite. The\r\nartery should be raised either in the upper or the middle thirds, but\r\npreferably in the former, as by raising at this point the artery is\r\nnot very deep in the tissues as it will be further down, and at the\r\nsame time one is able to get collateral circulation to the lower leg\r\nand foot by means of the deep femoral and the recurrent anterior and\r\nposterior tibials.\r\n\r\nIt is believed quite commonly, that by the injection of the femoral\r\nartery, there is a great danger of flushing the face. This belief\r\nis erroneous. Flushing of the face will result from the injection of\r\nany artery if it is full of blood and if it is found that the femoral\r\nartery contains blood, and likewise any other artery, this blood should\r\nbe removed before injection takes place, and what little then remains,\r\nwill not discolor the face, since it will be greatly diluted.\r\n\r\nThe internal long saphenous vein is mistaken frequently for the femoral\r\nartery. It is a superficial vein and is usually found empty after\r\ndeath. It lies a short distance to the inner side of the femoral artery\r\nin Scarpa's triangle. This vein is taken up frequently, not only by the\r\nyounger members of the profession, but by the older as well, when the\r\nguides are not followed closely, and when this mistake does occur, and\r\nfluid is injected through it, flushing of the face results.\r\n\r\nNext to the common carotid artery the femoral artery is the largest\r\nbranch artery used in embalming. The femoral artery commences\r\nimmediately behind Poupart's ligament and is a continuation of the\r\nexternal iliac artery.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 50—The femoral artery. (Gray)]\r\n\r\nIt passes down the forepart and inner side of the thigh, terminates at\r\nthe opening in the adductor magnus, at the junction of the middle with\r\nthe lower third of the thigh, where it becomes the popliteal artery.\r\nIn the upper third the artery is contained in a triangular space\r\ncalled _Scarpa's triangle_ and in the middle third of the thigh it is\r\ncontained in an aponeurotic canal called _Hunter's canal_.\r\n\r\nAt a point about one and one-half to two inches below Poupart's\r\nligament, the femoral artery gives off a branch to the outer and under\r\nside, known as the deep femoral artery, or the profunda femoris, which\r\ncourses the thigh downward, and connects with branches coming off the\r\npopliteal and the anterior tibial arteries, thus forming the collateral\r\ncirculation to the lower leg and foot.\r\n\r\nAs the femoral artery leaves the body, it is accompanied by the femoral\r\nvein, which for two inches down, lies along side the femoral artery to\r\nthe inner and under side. At about this juncture, however, it passes\r\nunderneath the artery and continues its course in that position until\r\nit passes below where we have occasion to use the artery.\r\n\r\nThe femoral artery can be used all the way from where it leaves\r\nthe body at Poupart's ligament until it reaches Hunter's canal. At\r\nPoupart's ligament the artery is very superficial, being covered only\r\nby the skin, superficial fascia and superficial lymphatic glands, but\r\nit gets deeper further down, being covered not only by the above named\r\ntissues, but also by muscles, making it very difficult to raise in the\r\nmiddle and lower thirds of the thigh. About five to seven inches below\r\nPoupart's ligament the artery passes under the adductor magnus muscle,\r\nand enters what is known as Hunter's canal. Because this artery does\r\nget deeper as it courses down the thigh, it is generally raised in the\r\nupper third.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the anatomy of the vessels of the thigh and leg will be\r\nof value in treating accidents when this member is injured.\r\n\r\n_Scarpa's triangle_ is a triangular space, the apex of which is\r\ndirected downward, and the sides formed externally by the sartorius\r\nmuscle, internally by the inner border of the adductor longus muscle,\r\nand above by Poupart's ligament. The floor of the space is formed from\r\nwithout inward by the ilio-psoas pectineus and the adductor longus\r\nmuscles. The space is divided into two nearly equal divisions by the\r\nfemoral vessels, which extend from the middle of its base to its apex,\r\nthe artery giving off in this situation the superficial and profunda\r\nbranches, and the vein receiving the deep femoral and the internal\r\nsaphenous veins. Besides the vessels and nerves this space contains\r\nsome fat and lymphatics.\r\n\r\n_Hunter's canal_ is the aponeurotic space in the middle third of the\r\nthigh, extending from the apex of Scarpa's triangle to the femoral\r\nopening in the adductor magnus muscle. Hunter's canal contains the\r\nfemoral artery and vein inclosed in their own sheath of areolar tissue,\r\nthe vein being behind and on the outer side of the artery, and the long\r\nsaphenous nerve lying at first on the outer side and then in front of\r\nthe vessels.\r\n\r\n_Linear Guide._—The guide for the femoral artery is represented by a\r\nline drawn from the center of Poupart's ligament to the inner side of\r\nthe knee joint.\r\n\r\nPoupart's ligament extends from the crest of the ileum bone to the\r\ntop of the pubic bone. To determine the center of Poupart's ligament\r\nfor the right leg, get on the right side of the body and with the\r\nleft hand, place the second finger on the top of the pubic bone and\r\nthe thumb on the crest of the ileum bone, then let the index finger\r\ndrop down between the two which will represent the commencement of the\r\nfemoral artery.\r\n\r\n_Anatomical Guide._—The artery runs through the center of Scarpa's\r\ntriangle from the center of its base to its apex. In the middle third\r\nof the thigh the artery passes beneath the vastus medialis muscle and\r\nenters Hunter's canal.\r\n\r\n_Relation of the Artery, Vein and Nerve._—The femoral vein at Poupart's\r\nligament lies close to the inner side of the artery, separated from it\r\nby a thin fibrous partition; but two inches down the vein runs behind\r\nthe artery and then to its outer side.\r\n\r\nThere is no nerve in relation to the artery in the upper third, the\r\nanterior crural nerve lies about half an inch to the outer side of\r\nthe femoral artery, being separated from the artery by the ilio-psoas\r\nmuscle. In the middle third of the thigh the internal saphenous nerve\r\nis situated on the outer side of the artery, but not usually in the\r\nsame sheath with the artery.\r\n\r\n_To raise the femoral artery_ in its proper place, is to measure down\r\nfrom Poupart's ligament from one and one-half to two inches in the\r\nlinear guide, and there begin the incision, making it two inches or\r\nless in length. This will bring the incision below the point where the\r\ncollateral branches are given off. Cut through the skin, then the fat,\r\nwhich will vary in thickness with the subject. Underneath the fat are\r\nseveral layers of deep fascia, which must be split the length of the\r\nincision.\r\n\r\nThe femoral artery will then be seen, and underneath it will be the\r\nfemoral vein. Both will be in the same common sheath of fascia, which\r\nmay be removed with a hook by gently tearing the sheath loose over the\r\nartery. When the artery has been loosened the length of the incision,\r\nraise it to the surface, placing a bone separator underneath for a\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to remove the blood, the femoral vein should then be\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCAVITY EMBALMING.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cavity Embalming.=—In shipping a body, cavity embalming must always be\r\nresorted to and consists of introducing a trocar into the abdominal and\r\nthoracic cavities and injecting sufficient fluid over the contents of\r\nthese cavities to thoroughly preserve them.\r\n\r\nThe scientific work in the embalming of to-day is being done on the\r\narteries, but cavity embalming should still hold an important place\r\nwith those embalmers who desire to get the best results. Although\r\nthe arteries have been injected, yet we find that sometimes the fluid\r\ndoes not reach the cavities. Any cavity may contain gas or material\r\nfor decomposition, such as blood, pus, lymph, or as in perforation\r\nof the intestines, feces in the abdominal cavity. Besides these we\r\nalways have the bacteria of decomposition, called saprophytes, which\r\nhave thoroughly invaded the organs and tissues of the body as soon as\r\nsixteen hours after death. Then, if for any reason the fluid has not\r\nreached a certain part, fermentation, and putrefaction will immediately\r\nset in.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cerebral Cavity.=—Gases may be generated in the cerebral cavity\r\nsoon after death, especially in drowned cases, where the gas forming\r\nbacteria, the aerogenes capsulati, are distributed all over the body.\r\nThese bacteria work much more rapidly in fresh or shallow water, or in\r\nthe summer when the water is warm, than in the winter when the water\r\nis cold, or the body is in salt water. The gases may penetrate every\r\ntissue in the body, particularly the tissues about the eyes, which\r\ngives the eyes their bulged appearance. The gases that are formed in\r\nthe brain and forced out into the tissues surrounding the eye do not\r\nenter the eye ball. In these cases the eye ball may or may not be\r\npushed out of its socket, depending, of course, upon the amount of\r\ngases that have been produced.\r\n\r\nThese gases may be removed by inserting a trocar inside the head at the\r\ninner angle of the eye or in the nose through the turbinated process of\r\nthe ethmoid bone.\r\n\r\nAfter the gases have been removed from the inside of the skull, about\r\none-half pint of strong formaldehyde fluid should be injected.\r\n\r\nAnother method of inserting the trocar into the brain would be to pass\r\nit through the foramen magnum. This can be done by inserting the trocar\r\nin the neck a little below and behind the lobe of the ear, directing\r\nthe needle upward and inward toward the opposite eyebrow, when the\r\nneedle will enter the subarachnoid space (Barnes Method).\r\n\r\nIn cases of hydrocephalus (water on the brain) where there may be from\r\none to two quarts of water inside the cranium, the water may be removed\r\nby any of the above processes.\r\n\r\nFor ordinary cases we do not feel that it is necessary to make a cavity\r\ninjection in the head for the reason that the circulation there is\r\ncomplete, only in rare instances do we find an obstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Purging.=—By purging, as the embalmer uses the term, is meant, the\r\nfluid which emerges from the mouth and nose of the cadaver. If this\r\nfluid is a brownish coffee-like substance, it signifies it is coming\r\nfrom the stomach, but if it is a bloody frothy mixture it signifies it\r\nis coming from the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe real cause of purging is the living and growing saprophytic\r\nbacteria, which were normally in the body, or having gained access\r\nlater, produce as a result of their development, gas formations. These\r\ngases confined as they are, press out from the stomach and lungs the\r\ncontained fluids of the color mentioned above.\r\n\r\nPurging from the stomach may either be due to the presence of gases in\r\nthe stomach itself, or in the intestines or in both. If the gases have\r\nformed in the intestines, they would dilate the canal sufficiently to\r\nfill the entire abdominal cavity, thus pressing the stomach against the\r\ndiaphragm with enough force to cause the contents to escape through the\r\nupper end of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nPurging from the lungs is due to the presence of bacteria of\r\nputrefaction, which begin to develope in the diseased portions. These\r\ncause liquefaction of the lung substance and the formation of gas.\r\nThe gas will force the liquefied matter, of a bloody, frothy color out\r\nthrough the respiratory tract.\r\n\r\nBefore embalming of the chest and the abdominal cavity is begun\r\nthe trachea and the esophagus should be treated in order to prevent\r\npurging. There are two ways of doing this:\r\n\r\nThe first method consists of placing a ligature about the trachea and\r\nthe esophagus, this is done by making an incision through the skin and\r\ntissues over the left edge of the trachea, one-half inch above the top\r\nof the sternum. Insert the right forefinger, passing it to the right\r\nside behind the trachea and the esophagus to separate the tissues from\r\nthem. In doing this great care should be taken so as not to injure the\r\ncarotid on the left and the innominate artery on the right side. Pass\r\nthe aneurism hook threaded with narrow tape (this must be very strong\r\ntape) along the inner side of the finger, below the trachea and the\r\nesophagus, to the point of entrance on the left side. You will have no\r\ndifficulty now in tying securely both the above tubes, and there will\r\nbe no possibility of purging from either the lungs or the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe second method of preventing purging from the lungs and stomach\r\nconsists in plugging the pharynx through the mouth, there-by plugging\r\nthe trachea and the esophagus. The only disadvantage of this method is\r\nthat it can not be done successfully after the body has been embalmed\r\narterially. And for this reason, after arterial embalming, the lower\r\njaw will be firmly set and to use this method, it would mean that the\r\nlower jaw must be pried back in order to gain access through the mouth.\r\nThen it will be found very difficult and in some cases impossible to\r\nset the lower jaw again in its proper position. If this method is to\r\nbe used at all, it is advised that you do the plugging of the pharynx\r\nbefore the arterial embalming has been done.\r\n\r\nTo do this, take your position at the head of subject on the right\r\nside, and open the mouth wide enough to admit two fingers. Roll several\r\npieces of dry cotton, the size of an English walnut, and holding the\r\ncorner of the mouth back with the left hand, insert a ball of cotton\r\nwith the right hand and shove it hard down behind the tongue (this\r\ncan best be done with a pair of clamp forceps). Continue to do this\r\nuntil the pharynx is well and firmly filled, but avoid bulging out the\r\nside of the cheek. If properly done this plug will prevent an ordinary\r\namount of purging and dry cotton seems much better to use for this\r\npurpose than absorbent. It must be borne in mind that simply filling\r\nthe mouth is of no use; nothing is plugged by this procedure, as it\r\nleaves the opening into the nose open.\r\n\r\nIf you had not anticipated purging in the beginning, and the body has\r\nbeen embalmed arterially it will be necessary to stop the purging by\r\nthe first method.\r\n\r\nA third method of preventing purging from the lungs and stomach is in\r\nthe use of plaster of paris. In this method the plaster of paris is\r\nmixed thinly, then by means of a paper funnel, pour the liquid into the\r\nnose and mouth, then plug tightly with absorbent cotton as in method\r\ntwo. It requires only a short time for the plaster of paris to set and\r\nit has been found quite successful. Probably the only disadvantage\r\nof this method is that it is mussy and because of the rapid drying\r\nqualities of the plaster of paris the operator must work very quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Thoracic or Chest Cavity.=—Cavity embalming must be resorted to\r\nfrequently in the chest or thoracic cavity for the reason that in\r\ncertain diseases, especially tuberculosis, fluids cannot enter the\r\ndiseased cavities, as the capillaries and small vessels are destroyed\r\nby the disease and the ends of the arteries securely plugged. If\r\nthis were not so, the patient would have died of hemorrhage of those\r\narteries, a thing which seldom takes place.\r\n\r\nAgain in certain other diseases, especially pneumonia, the fluid cannot\r\nreach the diseased lung, either through the nutrient arteries or by\r\nthe respiratory tract, because of the resistance offered. The nutrient\r\narteries will be filled with coagulated blood and the bronchi, to a\r\ncertain extent, with a bloody mucous.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, the bacteria of putrefaction will begin to develop\r\nwithin the diseased portions of the lungs, and will be the cause of the\r\npurging so much dreaded by the embalmer.\r\n\r\nThe thoracic cavity may be treated by one of several methods.\r\n\r\nA first method consists in passing a curved trocar into the trachea\r\njust above the sternum and injecting a strong embalming fluid into\r\nthe bronchi. In cases of gangrene of the lung, the sputum has a very\r\noffensive odor, which may be disinfected by this method. But it must\r\nbe remembered that the ends of the bronchioles which enter the diseased\r\nparts of lungs will be closed (from the nature of the disease), so that\r\nany fluid injected into the bronchi from the trachea will not reach the\r\ndiseased part of the lungs. You will thus see that it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to use a method in treating the thoracic cavity, whereby\r\nany mass of rotten tissue, which may be present, may become thoroughly\r\nsaturated with the disinfectant.\r\n\r\nA second method written about the Robbins, is accomplished by inserting\r\nthe trocar on both the right and left sides at the tops of the lungs,\r\nand at the bases. At the top of the lungs the trocar is introduced two\r\ninches outside the sternum just below the clavicle. The trocar may then\r\nbe pushed in any direction, except toward the sternum, without injury\r\nto any of the larger vessels.\r\n\r\nThe arch of the aorta passes a little to the right of the sternum and\r\nas high as the lower border of the first rib, then makes a turn to\r\nthe left and goes directly back to the left side of the fifth dorsal\r\nvertebra. The superior vena cava lies a little to the right of the\r\narch of the aorta. The advantage of inserting at this point rather\r\nthan above the clavicle is that there are no vessels in the location\r\nin danger of perforation. If the trocar is inserted above the clavicle\r\non either the right or the left side there is danger of perforating\r\nthe subclavian artery or vein, while if the insertion is made next\r\nto the sternum, the aorta may be perforated, in either case breaking\r\nthe circulation. Disease fluids are seldom found at the top or apexes\r\nof the lungs, but in consumption, breaking down of the lung substance\r\nusually begins at this point, especially in young cases. To insure a\r\nperfect embalming of the lungs, you should inject at the apexes, about\r\na half-pint of strong formaldehyde on each side. It should, however, be\r\nremembered that the injection at the tops of the lungs, as suggested,\r\ngives no fluid to the lower parts of the lungs where it is often most\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nIt is not an unusual condition to find a whole lobe rotten and broken\r\ndown at the base of the lung, and when such a diseased condition exists\r\nthe lungs become firmly attached to the chest walls, and unless fluid\r\nis placed below these adhesions it does not reach the diseased parts.\r\nThe intelligent embalmer, will never trust to the fluid passing from\r\nthe tops of the lungs to the base, as in almost all cases the adhesions\r\nbetween the lungs and the walls absolutely prevent this taking place.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary first to draw off by aspiration, at the bases of the\r\nlungs, the fluids which have accumulated and which may be either water,\r\npus or blood. This is done by inserting a curved trocar of small size,\r\nbetween the fifth and sixth ribs on the axillary line. The thoracic\r\ncavity extends in the back as low as the last rib and the twelfth\r\ndorsal vertebra and it may be necessary to pass the trocar down into\r\nthis part of the cavity in order to remove the fluids.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fluids are removed, inject from a pint to a quart of\r\nstrong formaldehyde on either side. By so doing the gangrenous and\r\ndecomposed part of the lung will be put to soak in the embalming fluid,\r\nwhich will insure perfect disinfection and an absence of bad odors.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Abdominal Cavity.=—Often it will be found necessary to do cavity work\r\nin the abdominal cavity. Gases may arise causing a distention of the\r\nabdominal wall, resulting in purging from the mouth and nose. This gas\r\nis the result of putrefaction and fermentation in the alimentary canal.\r\nWhen one of the principle arteries is injected, the fluid finds its\r\nway to the minute capillaries of the organs of the abdominal cavity,\r\nincluding the stomach and the intestines. It must be remembered that\r\noften there is a great amount of undigested food and fecal matter in\r\nthe stomach and intestines. The only way the fluid which is in the\r\nminute capillary circulation of the stomach and intestines, is able\r\nto reach the inside of those organs and come in contact with the\r\nundigested food and the fecal matter is by soaking through the mucous\r\nwall. No doubt a certain quantity of the fluid does soak through, and\r\nwhen it does, if there is not much undigested food or fecal matter\r\nin these parts, disinfection will be accomplished and it is in these\r\ncases that we do not have any trouble with distentions of the abdomen.\r\nWhen however, there is a great amount of undigested food and fecal\r\nmatter inside the stomach and the intestinal tract, it is only obvious\r\nthat enough fluid can not possibly soak through to disinfect, and\r\nconsequently a host of putrefactive, and fermentative germs will begin\r\ntheir work, with the formation of gases and the distended abdomen, and\r\nperhaps purging from the mouth and nose.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the formation of gas now which has arisen, a second\r\ninjection will do no good. More drastic measures will have to be used.\r\nOne method that has long been in vogue is the use of the trocar.\r\n\r\n_The Trocar Method._—In this method a trocar varying in length from\r\nsix to fourteen inches is used. It may either pierce the abdominal\r\nwall through the umbilicus, or two inches above and two inches to the\r\nleft of the umbilicus. Then after the trocar has entered the abdomen\r\nthe secret of removing gases successfully depends very largely upon\r\nthe operator having a very correct idea of the location of all the\r\nabdominal organs. It is difficult to know when the trocar has pierced\r\nthe interior of the stomach, or in fact even to make it pierce the\r\nstomach at all for the peritoneum which is a covering for all the\r\norgans of the abdominal cavity contains a serous fluid which makes\r\nthe organs slippery, and even the sharp pointed trocar often does not\r\ntake hold as it should. Again it must be remembered that the stomach\r\nis a hollow organ, and for example let us try to pierce a soft rubber\r\nball, containing air and a small opening, a condition resembling the\r\nstomach, with a trocar, we know that the one wall, will have to be\r\npushed up against the other wall, and then placed against something\r\nfirm, before the trocar will pass through. Just this condition happens\r\nwith the stomach when the trocar tries to pierce the arterial wall of\r\nthe stomach there is nothing solid to bear against and consequently the\r\nfront wall will be pushed up against the back wall and then if enough\r\npressure is now used to push the trocar through, it is very liable to\r\npass all the way through both walls.\r\n\r\nAgain it must be remembered that the descending aorta passes very close\r\nbehind the stomach and should the trocar go all the way through the\r\naorta might be pierced and the circulation in a measure ruined. The one\r\nmain disadvantage of this trocar method is that the operator is always\r\nworking blindly, it is always impossible to tell just how much damage\r\nmay be done to the internal organs and the circulation, and again\r\nshould the operator desire to place fluid in a certain part—say the\r\ninside of the intestines or the inside of the stomach or the colons,\r\nwill the operator have assured knowledge that he has actually placed\r\nthe fluid in the part desired. From the number of experiments that\r\nhave been carried out in our anatomical rooms, the proof seems to be in\r\nevery case that the fluid has not reached the part it was supposed to\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this method is the fact that by introducing the\r\ntrocar into the abdominal cavity two inches above and two inches to\r\nthe left of the navel that after the abdomen has been treated that the\r\ntrocar then can be directed upward into the thoracic cavity and fluid\r\nthere distributed to the several parts, but this is seldom necessary.\r\nAfter the trocar has been removed or better, just before the trocar is\r\nentirely pulled out the operator should sew a circular stitch about the\r\nwound and then as soon as the trocar is pulled out, pull the stitch\r\nclosely together as if it were a draw string, and tie. This will\r\nprevent any further leakage from the part.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Direct Incision.=—Sometimes before the body is embalmed or a day\r\nor two after the body has been embalmed, there is a distention of the\r\nabdominal wall indicating gases and there may or may not be purging\r\nfrom the mouth and nose. From the great number of cases that have been\r\nposted in our anatomical laboratories, it has been found that the gas\r\nthat has accumulated is as a rule located in either the stomach, the\r\ntransverse colon, or the colons in general, but rarely in the small\r\nintestines to the extent that it would do much damage. By the use\r\nof the direct incision, make a cut with a sharp scalpel, about three\r\ninches long in the median line of the body over the abdomen. Start the\r\ncut about one inch below the ensiform process of the sternum and cut\r\ntoward the navel. After a cut has been made three inches in length on\r\nthe skin, direct the scalpel downward so that it enters the abdomen.\r\nPlace the index and second finger in the incision thus made pressing\r\nthe organs from the abdominal wall, and carefully cut upward between\r\nthe two fingers. This will prevent the operator cutting any of the\r\nunderlying intestines.\r\n\r\nThe incision having been made, it is evident now that the part\r\ncontaining the gas will come up into the incision. If the stomach\r\ncontains the gas it will come up, if the transverse colon contains\r\nthe gas it will come up, but that makes no difference, for it is the\r\npart with the gas that the operator is after. Usually the transverse\r\ncolon will be the first to come up into the incision, now take hold\r\nof the part with your artery forceps and with a pair of scissors make\r\na clip through the wall, this will let the gas escape. Do not let\r\nthe gas escape into the room not deodorized, so place over the hand\r\nquickly after you have made the clip, a towel, or absorbent cotton\r\nthat has been saturated with formaldehyde, this will both deodorize and\r\ndisinfect the gas. Keep hold of the part until all the gas has escaped,\r\nand then pick up the arterial tube and inject a small quantity of fluid\r\nin the colon, and then sew up with the circular stitch. Then locate the\r\nstomach, which can easily be found if it contains gas and treat it in\r\nthe same way, relieving the gases and then placing a small amount of\r\nfluid inside. Treat the other several parts of the intestines in the\r\nsame way if gas be present and it is remarkable how quickly the abdomen\r\nsinks to its normal level. After this has been done place hardening\r\ncompound or common salt in the cavity, and placing a layer of absorbent\r\ncotton in the abdomen under the incision, sew up neatly.\r\n\r\nThe one great advantage of this method is that you can actually see\r\nwhat you are doing, you can see the part that contains the gas and\r\ntreat that part particularly, the operator is not working blindly, but\r\nis able to place the fluid in the part that he desires and is assured\r\nof the fact that it is in the part for his eyes do not deceive him as\r\nthe sense of feel and touch sometimes do. By this method the operator\r\nis able to surround the parts of the abdominal cavity with a hardening\r\ncompound, and thus feel sure that his case if it is to be shipped,\r\nwill be received in proper condition, at least it will be as far as the\r\nabdomen is concerned, if it is treated under this method. This method\r\nis one sure cure for purging, for the gases once properly relieved from\r\nthe stomach and the contents disinfected, there is no chance for them\r\nto recur. If the stomach is found to be full of liquid as well as of\r\ngas, as is the condition during purging, the liquid can be taken from\r\nthe stomach with a drainage tube or a stomach pump, and lastly every\r\npart is deodorized and disinfected properly.\r\n\r\nA seeming disadvantage might be that a critic might suggest that you\r\nare mutilating the body with your abdominal incision. Let a fair\r\nquestion be asked. If it were your sister that was to be embalmed\r\nand gases had to be removed, which would you rather see some operator\r\nrunning a trocar here and there through the abdomen, relieving gases\r\nand injecting fluid here and there, or, the use of the neat surgical\r\nincision, made as a surgeon would make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Embalming of the Subcutaneous Tissue.=—It is not always possible to\r\nfill the tissues of the body through the arterial system, the arteries\r\nmay be full of blood in a coagulated condition so that it can not\r\nbe removed, the walls of the arteries may be diseased, or they may\r\nbe severed at many places the result of accidental death, such as\r\nrailroad accident, etc. If any of the above conditions be present or\r\nother similar conditions, it will be impossible to inject the arterial\r\nsystem, or it may be that arterial injection is only partly possible.\r\nIn order, in arterial embalming, to have the tissues embalmed the\r\nfluid must reach the capillaries, and to fill the capillaries it is\r\nfirst necessary to fill the larger arteries. So if for any reason it\r\nis impossible to reach all or certain tissues by arterial embalming, it\r\nbecomes necessary to resort to some other means.\r\n\r\nWith these difficulties then in view, the best operation for filling\r\nthe tissues, that is the subcutaneous tissue covering the bony\r\nframework of the body, is the direct injection of fluid into the\r\npart by means of (1) the hollow needle trocar, and (2) the hypodermic\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\nThe hollow needle trocar is to be used for the rough work, so called.\r\nInserting the trocar into the center of the popliteal space it can be\r\npushed through the tissues of the foreleg, and fluid injected; then\r\nreversing, push the trocar through the tissues of the leg proper,\r\nand inject fluid. Inserting the trocar into the center of the bend of\r\nthe elbow it can be pushed into the tissues of the forearm, and fluid\r\ninjected; then reversing, push the trocar through the tissues of the\r\narm proper and inject fluid. Turn the body over so as to trocar the\r\nback. Insert the trocar above the sacrum bone in the middle line of\r\nthe back, and push the trocar through the fleshy parts of the gluteal\r\nregions, and inject fluid. Again insert the trocar in the middle line\r\nof the back between the two scapulae bones, and inject fluid into the\r\nregion of the shoulders and the small of the back.\r\n\r\nAfter each puncture, before the trocar is removed a circular stitch\r\nshould be thrown around the trocar and when the trocar is removed draw\r\nthe puncture shut, the circular stitch acting as a draw string.\r\n\r\nA large amount of fluid may be injected in this manner, it being\r\npossible to inject several gallons into a body of average size. The\r\nfluid transudes through the tissues very readily filling them up\r\ncompletely, but of course, not as certainly as if the fluid were\r\ninjected arterially. It is an easy matter to inject from two to three\r\ngallons of fluid into the soft tissues on the outside of the skeleton\r\nof a body weighing from 130 to 140 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis procedure is only to be used if it is impossible to inject\r\nthe body by the ordinary arterial embalming. The cavity work in the\r\ncerebro-spinal, the thoracic, and the abdominal cavity, should be done\r\nfirst, and then follow with this subcutaneous tissue outside the bony\r\nframework.\r\n\r\nThis procedure may be used in dropsical cases and in certain cases,\r\nwhere for some reason the fluid does not reach a certain part, or where\r\na certain part is not completely supplied with fluid, by the arterial\r\ninjection.\r\n\r\nThe hypodermic needle is to be used for the more delicate work, such\r\nas the hands and the face. Insert the needle at the wrist and direct it\r\ninto the palm of the hand, inject a very small quantity of fluid; then\r\ninto the back of the hand and inject a small quantity of fluid.\r\n\r\nTo reach the tissues of the face insert the needle into the muscles and\r\ntissues of the face from the inside of the mouth. The region about the\r\ntemple can be reached by inserting the needle into the tissues in the\r\nhair line, which will hide the puncture.\r\n\r\nWith the use of the hypodermic needle fluid can be placed in contact\r\nwith all the tissues of the hands and face, and the cosmetic effect\r\nwill be almost perfect if the operator is careful as to the amount he\r\ninjects, and is careful to see that, the fluid is equally distributed\r\nthroughout the part.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plugging Orifices of the Body.=—The proper manner in which to plug the\r\norifices of the body is to use a pledget of absorbent cotton dipped in\r\nyour embalming fluid and forced into all the orifices, following this\r\nup with a pledget of dry absorbent cotton. In this the fluid disinfects\r\nthe surface with which it comes in contact and the dry cotton prevents\r\nthe outgoing of the germs from the body or the passage inward of\r\nbacteria. It must be understood that absorbent cotton filters out germs\r\nfrom the air, even though air passes through it, they become entangled\r\nin the meshes of the cotton and there remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Removal of Urine.=—As a rule, in the last throes of death, the bladder\r\nis emptied, but in some instances this is not done and then it becomes\r\nnecessary for the embalmer to remove the urine. This may be done in\r\ntwo ways. Use the steel catheter, insert it in the bladder through\r\nthe urethra, and draw off the urine, or use the trocar and insert it\r\nthrough the abdominal wall in the median line just above the pubic\r\nbone, directing the end of the trocar into the bladder which lies just\r\nbelow the pubic bone and draw off the urine. It is seldom necessary to\r\ninject the bladder with fluid, as after the urine has been removed, we\r\nfind from general experience that it is well supplied with fluid from\r\nthe arterial injection.\r\n\r\nIn the male it is wise to tie a string about the penis just back of the\r\nhead, or glans, while in the female it is best to plug the meatus of\r\nthe urethra and the vagina with cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE REMOVAL OF BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Removal of Blood.=—In November 1882, Prof. J. H. Clarke and Dr.\r\nC. M. Lukens, while instructing a class in Philadelphia, in taking up\r\nthe carotid artery, the internal jugular vein was injured and a flow of\r\nblood followed much to their dismay. This however turned out to be one\r\nof the greatest events that ever happened for the embalming profession,\r\nas it marked the beginning of the practice of the removal of blood from\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nThere are some very important reasons why blood should be removed from\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n(1) There may be discolorations on the body, especially the face.\r\nThis discoloration may be due to the presence of blood in the minute\r\ncapillary system and other vessels which are near the surface skin.\r\nThis discoloration may be due to the presence of the bile pigments\r\nin the blood, which would tend to give the body a yellowish hue. This\r\ndiscoloration may be due to the breaking up or disintegration of the\r\nblood corpuscles after death, which would tend to give the tissues of\r\nthe body a light, pale, yellow color. Or this discoloration may be due\r\nto the presence of chromogenic bacteria, or color producing bacteria,\r\nin the blood, which might give to the tissues a characteristic green\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n(2) There may be blood in the arterial system after death, which\r\ncertainly will have to be removed or else it may be pushed into the\r\ntissues of the face during the injection of the fluid and cause a\r\ndiscoloration. Besides if the arteries are congested with blood, this\r\nwill have to be removed to make room for the embalming fluid, so that\r\nit will reach the capillaries and the tissues of the body.\r\n\r\n(3) There may be the formation of tissue gas, and there is no doubt but\r\nthat the removal of blood will greatly facilitate in the treatment, for\r\nwithout the blood, the fluid will have more chance to act on the parts\r\ncontaining the gas. This gas may be in the blood vessel itself, and\r\nthe removal of that blood then will relieve the gas and the pressure\r\nexerted by the gas, which will aid in the injection of the fluid.\r\n\r\n(4) To prevent a hasty decomposition. It may be that our subject is\r\nvery heavy and fleshy which will mean that there is more tissue to be\r\npreserved and necessarily more fluid will have to be used. To make room\r\nfor this increased amount of fluid, blood should be removed.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the body is in a hydropic condition. The tissues and\r\nthe blood vessels will be filled with water. This will mean a hasty\r\ndecomposition. The watery blood should be drawn from the blood vessels\r\nin order to make room for more fluid than ordinarily.\r\n\r\nIt may be that the body has died of a fever, which will also mean a\r\nhasty decomposition. This will mean that the blood will soon coagulate\r\nafter death, and therefore the sooner it is removed, the better for the\r\ngeneral cosmetic effect.\r\n\r\nWe do not however believe that blood should be removed from every\r\nsubject, in order to get good cosmetic effect. Rather there are times\r\nwhen blood should not be removed, the conditions which are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) In the thin emaciated subject where there is no discoloration. An\r\nexample of this condition would be in the tubercular subject, where\r\nbefore death the body has become very thin and emaciated. We would not\r\nremove blood when the subject is in this condition, for as a rule the\r\nbody will take plenty of fluid, the arteries are as a rule empty after\r\ndeath, and besides we desire to leave the blood in the body, in order\r\nto give the skin of the face a more filled out healthy cosmetic effect.\r\n\r\n(2) In the pale, marble-like, anemic subject. We would not remove blood\r\nin this case, first because it is not necessary, for there is a lack of\r\nblood in the surface capillaries showing that the arterial system is\r\ncompletely empty, and there is no congestion of the veins; secondly,\r\nexperience teaches us that in these cases, you probably would not get\r\nany blood if you did try to remove it, and thirdly what little blood\r\nis in the surface capillaries is needed to build up a more healthy\r\ncosmetic effect.\r\n\r\nThere are times when blood should be removed from the subject after\r\ndeath which are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Whenever blood is found in the arterial system. An example of\r\nthis might be found in those cases of sudden death, such as drowning,\r\nsuffocation, electric shock, or general heart failure. Whenever there\r\nhas been a case of sudden death, the operator may expect to find blood\r\nin the arterial system. The last contraction of the heart normally\r\nwould drive all the blood out of the arteries and arterial capillaries\r\ninto the venous capillaries and veins, but this is not accomplished in\r\nthe cases of sudden death. Whenever, on incising an artery, you find\r\nblood in the artery, and it runs freely, it indicates that there is a\r\nconsiderable quantity of blood in the arterial system. This blood then\r\nshould be removed, because, were fluid to be injected into the artery,\r\nwhen it is full of blood and in this congested condition, all of this\r\nblood would be pushed ahead of the fluid toward the center of pressure,\r\nand from there large quantities would be pushed back into the tissues\r\nof the face, which would result in a greatly discolored face and a very\r\npoor cosmetic effect. DO NOT FORGET. Always remove blood when you find\r\nit in the arteries. The regular blood drainage tube should be placed\r\nin the artery, and all the blood removed that is possible, before\r\nattempting to inject. If this blood is not removed, the operator need\r\nnot be surprised if he causes a decided blood discoloration of the face\r\nand a bad cosmetic effect. In these cases blood should be removed from\r\nthe veins too, for that procedure will help to make room for what blood\r\ndoes remain in the arteries and capillaries, so that it can be pushed\r\nby the fluid into the veins rather than the tissues of the face.\r\n\r\n(2) When the venous blood vessels are congested with blood and gas. An\r\nexample of this might be found in almost any case. When the operator\r\nmakes the incision to disclose the vessels and finds the venous\r\nchannels congested, or when over the body the surface veins show signs\r\nof congestion and distention with gases, then blood should be removed.\r\n\r\n(3) In dropsical cases. Often in these cases the tissues throughout\r\nthe body are in a hydropic condition (filled with water), the arteries\r\nas well as the veins are filled with a watery, bloody colored fluid.\r\nIt will be best for the operator to remove all this watery blood from\r\nthe arteries, veins, and the tissues also, in order to get the greatest\r\namount of preservative action from his fluid.\r\n\r\n(4) In heavy, fleshy subjects. Experience teaches us that these bodies\r\nare as a rule difficult to handle from a cosmetic, as well as from\r\na preservative standpoint. It seems advisable to draw blood from\r\nthese subjects whenever possible, and by so doing bring about a clear\r\nnon-discolored cosmetic effect; also the removal of blood will give\r\nmore room for a greater supply of fluid, and thus the tissues will be\r\nbetter preserved.\r\n\r\n(5) When the face is discolored. Whenever the operator takes charge of\r\na body and finds the face discolored, no matter what the cause of the\r\ndiscoloration may be, it is a good indication to remove blood from that\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nBy removing blood from the larger venous channels, the operator will\r\nmake room for the blood to leave the face, and in this way better\r\ncosmetic effect is assured. Massage the face toward the internal\r\njugular vein, and push the discoloring blood from the tissues of the\r\nface, out into the larger channels, that have been emptied by the\r\nremoval of blood.\r\n\r\n(6) In fever. Whenever a body dies in a high state of fever, it\r\nindicates a hasty coagulation of the blood, and a tendency to a\r\ndiscoloration of the face. Whenever the operator knows that the subject\r\nhas died of a fever, or when there has been considerable fever on the\r\nbody before death, then blood should be removed.\r\n\r\n(7) To make room for fluid. The average embalmer only injects a gallon\r\nto a gallon and a half of fluid into a body. There are times when the\r\noperator desires to use more fluid. It may be that the body will have\r\nto be shipped a long distance, perhaps to another country or a distant\r\nstate. After a certain amount of fluid has been injected the vessels\r\nbecome filled up and there is a great resistance established. If the\r\noperator disregards this pressure, and forces still more fluid into the\r\narterial system, the fine capillary network will be broken, especially\r\nin the lung where the result will be a leakage of fluid through the\r\nmouth and nose from the ruptured air cells in the lung, or in the\r\ntissues of the skin, where the result will be a leakage into a certain\r\narea of tissue later causing a condition known as leathery skin. To\r\nhave prevented this the operator should not have forced the fluid\r\nbeyond a certain maximum resistance. He could, though, have reduced\r\nthis resistance by removing the blood from the venous system, and then\r\nsucceeded in the further injection of fluid.\r\n\r\nThere are times when blood ought to be removed from a subject after\r\ndeath, but for some reason it seems impossible to remove any. The\r\nreasons may be stated briefly as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The blood may already be in a coagulated condition, owing to the\r\nfact that the body has died in a state of high fever.\r\n\r\n(2) The blood may be in a coagulated condition owing to the fact, that\r\nthe bacteria of decomposition and putrefaction, have so altered the\r\nblood as to make its removal impossible.\r\n\r\n(3) Certain drugs may have been previously given, or taken during life\r\nwhich would cause a hasty coagulation of the blood.\r\n\r\n(4) The body may still be in a condition of rigor, and although the\r\noperator may have released the rigor in the joints, still all the\r\ntissues are in that condition, a condition which might prevent the\r\nblood from draining from the veins no matter what method was used.\r\n\r\nArterial blood is removed from the aorta indirectly, and from the\r\narteries, only when the arterial system contains blood after death.\r\n\r\nVenous blood is removed from the right side of the heart directly or\r\nindirectly, and the veins, only when it is deemed necessary by the\r\noperator.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of removing this arterial or venous blood from\r\nthe body. These two methods are aspiration and drainage. Besides these\r\ntwo methods some modified methods or combinations of the two, are\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nAspiration consists in actually pumping the blood from the heart,\r\narteries or veins. In this method, if blood is to be taken from the\r\nheart directly, the trocar is used; if the blood is to be taken from\r\nthe heart indirectly or from the arteries or the veins one of the\r\ndrainage tubes is used. Either the trocar or the drainage tube is\r\nconnected by rubber tubing, to the goose neck on the blood bottle,\r\nwhich in turn is connected by rubber tubing to the aspirator side of\r\nthe aspirator and injector pump. When the air is drawn from the blood\r\nbottle, there is a vacuum formed, which will aspirate or draw the blood\r\nfrom the heart directly or indirectly from the arteries or veins. The\r\none great disadvantage of this method is that if the vacuum is made too\r\ngreat, the artery or vein will collapse ahead of the drainage tube and\r\nthus prevent the successful aspiration of the blood.\r\n\r\nDrainage or gravity consists in opening one of the principle arteries\r\nor veins of the body, inserting a blood drainage tube into the artery\r\nor vein as far as it seems practical, and then connecting the blood\r\ndrainage tube to the blood bottle by means of rubber tubing. The blood\r\nbottle should be placed considerably lower than the body in order to\r\nhave the blood drain successfully. If the femoral artery or vein is\r\nused, the body ought to be on a considerable incline, the head at least\r\none foot higher than the feet in order to get the maximum amount of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nIf the axillary, brachial, or carotid, or their corresponding veins\r\nare used, the body ought to be on a level or turned to the side of the\r\nopening veins.\r\n\r\nSimple drainage in itself is not a very successful method of getting\r\nthe maximum amount of blood from the body.\r\n\r\nThe process can be modified in three ways which are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) By placing the blood drainage tube in the vein and the arterial\r\ntube in the corresponding artery. Inject fluid into the arteries\r\nwhich will tend to push the blood in turn from the capillaries into\r\nthe veins, and out into the drainage tube into the blood bottle. This\r\nmodified method has been called by Robbins “Displacement.” This is a\r\ngood name and one which should be generally adopted.\r\n\r\n(2) By placing the blood drainage tube in the artery or vein,\r\npreferably the femoral, and connect it by means of rubber tubing to\r\nthe blood bottle. The operator now stands at the head of the subject,\r\nhe reaches over, takes hold of each hand of the subject, raises the\r\narms of the subject to right angles with the subject, then crosses the\r\narms and with a steady gentle pressure bears down on the chest of the\r\nsubject over the heart region.\r\n\r\nIf the axillary is used the operator is able to manipulate but one arm,\r\nthe one opposite. Raise this arm to right angles with the body then\r\nfold down on the chest, exerting an even steady pressure. By raising\r\nthe arms the blood will leave the hands, and each time pressure is\r\nexerted on the chest blood begins to flow from the artery or the vein,\r\nand will continue to flow as long as the even pressure is exerted.\r\n\r\n(3) By the combination of number one and two. The operator opens the\r\nartery, preferably the femoral, inserts the arterial tube, and injects\r\na pint of fluid to exert a pressure on the venous system. He then opens\r\nthe vein, inserts the blood drainage tube which is connected with the\r\nblood bottle. With the pump in his right hand (granting that he is\r\nusing the aspirator and injector pump), he stands at the head of the\r\nsubject and slowly injects the fluid. If at any time the blood ceases\r\nto flow, by taking hold of the hands, raising both arms at right angles\r\nto the subject, crossing, and while in this position injecting a few\r\nounces of fluid, then bear down gently on the chest with a steady\r\npressure. If the blood will not flow by this method and the operator\r\nis using either the axillary or the femoral, there is hardly any use of\r\ntrying any other method. The operator will be able to draw the maximum\r\namount of blood with this method, if it is at all possible to draw\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nOften when the blood stops flowing, there is a blood clot formation\r\nahead of the drainage tube. By injecting just a few ounces of fluid or\r\nsalt water through the tube into the vein, the clot may be pushed to\r\none side, and the blood will continue to flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Removal of Blood from the Right Auricle of the Heart. Direct\r\nMethod.=—Insert the trocar in the third intercostal space, just to\r\nthe right edge of the sternum or the breastbone. The trocar should be\r\ninserted obliquely, the point of the trocar is to pass in the general\r\ndirection of the left hip joint, while the open end of the trocar is to\r\npoint in the general direction of the right ear. A general knowledge of\r\nthe anatomy as far as the location of the heart is absolutely necessary\r\nto master this procedure. The object is to have the point of the trocar\r\npierce the right auricle of the heart. When the trocar has pierced the\r\nright auricle, which the operator will have to judge through practice,\r\nattach rubber tubing to the gooseneck of the blood bottle and by the\r\nuse of the aspirator pump, draw the blood from the heart into the blood\r\nbottle. This is removal of blood by aspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Removal of Blood from the Right Ventricle of the Heart. Direct\r\nMethod.=—Insert the long thin twelve or fourteen inch trocar two inches\r\nabove and two inches to the left of the navel and pierce the abdominal\r\nwall, pass the trocar keeping the point close to the abdominal wall,\r\nin the general direction of the right shoulder as far as the lower\r\nborder of the third intercostal space, without fear of breaking any\r\ncirculation. The right ventricle will thus be reached from which blood\r\ncan be aspirated as in the previous method. Here again a general\r\nknowledge of the anatomy as far as the location of all the organs\r\nin the upper abdominal and thoracic cavity is necessary to perform a\r\nsuccessful operation. This is removal of blood by aspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Removal of Blood from the Right Auricle of the Heart. Indirect\r\nMethod.=—Make the incision for the femoral artery and vein.\r\n\r\nRaise the artery and inject about a pint of fluid in order to cause a\r\npressure on the venous system. Open the vein and insert the flexible\r\nrubber drainage tube, known on the market as the Red Seal drainage tube\r\nor the Worsham drainage tube. Push this tube up through the femoral,\r\nexternal iliac, the ascending vena cava, through the eustachian valve,\r\nand into the right auricle of the heart.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine when the tube is inside the right auricle, the\r\noperator should have laid the tube on the external surface of the\r\nbody from the point of entrance to the point where the right auricle\r\nnormally should be, allowing for the bend of the vein in its course.\r\nMark the tube, then when it has been pushed into the vein to that point\r\nthe operator is reasonably sure that the end is in the right auricle.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the tube slip easily it should be greased with a\r\nliquid solution of vaseline.\r\n\r\nAfter the tube has reached the right auricle the blood may be allowed\r\nto drain, or it may be aspirated.\r\n\r\nEither femoral may be used, but the left femoral is preferable owing to\r\nthe fact that, the angle at the bifurcation of the ascending vena cava\r\nis more obtuse.\r\n\r\nIf the operator desires to remove blood from the heart, we believe that\r\nthe indirect method is the better way. By the use of the direct method\r\nto draw blood from the right auricle by means of the trocar there is\r\nalways danger of rupturing the circulation. The aorta may be accidently\r\npierced. When the trocar is inserted from below to reach the right\r\nventricle the stomach may be punctured and the liver and diaphragm will\r\nhave to be pierced which, too, may mean an injured circulation. If any\r\naccidental damage has been done, it can not be remedied. The direct\r\nmethod is a blind procedure and is always uncertain. On the other hand\r\nif the flexible rubber drainage tube is inserted into the vein it must\r\nfollow the channel of that vein. It is more certain than the trocar\r\nmethod and there is no danger of rupturing the circulation.\r\n\r\nThe basilic or axillary vein may be used to remove blood from the heart\r\ninstead of the femoral. These veins should be used on the left side\r\nof the body owing to the fact that the angle at the junction of the\r\nsubclavian and internal jugular veins is not so acute as on the right\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Removal of Blood by the Use of the Femoral Vein.=—The use of the\r\nfemoral vein is considered by some operators a very good method. The\r\nfemoral should be employed in the upper third. Make the incision in\r\nthe center of Scarpa's triangle, just below Poupart's ligament. The\r\nincision should be about two inches in length, the length of the\r\nincision usually depends upon the size and thickness of the thigh and\r\nthe depth of the vein in the tissue. Expose the artery and the vein.\r\nThe vein at this point will lie to the inside of and a little below\r\nthe femoral artery. Open the artery and inject about a pint of fluid to\r\ncause a pressure on the venous system.\r\n\r\nHave all the blood drainage outfit in readiness then open the vein\r\nand quickly insert the drainage tube. Any of the drainage tubes now\r\ncommonly sold on the market are good. For the femoral, though, the\r\nflexible rubber drainage tube seems to be the best, because the femoral\r\nvein dips deep down into the posterior part of the abdomen after\r\nit leaves the Poupart's ligament. The flexible rubber drainage tube\r\nwill follow this bend and can be pushed as far as is desired by the\r\noperator, in contrast the steel drainage tube could only be pushed into\r\nthe vein for a few inches.\r\n\r\nBlood ought to drain out into the blood bottle, if it does not, inject\r\na little more fluid to cause more pressure on the venous system, and if\r\nit will not flow by the drainage method or any of its modifications try\r\nthe aspirator. If blood still will not flow, it may mean that there is\r\na clot ahead of the drainage tube. Pump some fluid through the drainage\r\ntube into the vein, to see if the tube is open, then let the fluid\r\ndrain out which usually will bring some blood. After you have tried all\r\nthe methods, if blood still does not flow, it will indicate that the\r\nblood is either in a coagulated condition, or there is not very much\r\nblood in that particular vein, which in this case is the femoral. The\r\nblood may be more in the dependent parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Removal of Blood from the Axillary Vein.=—The axillary vein is of\r\nlarge size, and is formed by the junction of the venae comites or\r\ndeep brachial veins with the basilic. The axillary vein begins at the\r\nlower part of the axillary space, increases in size as it ascends by\r\nreceiving tributaries corresponding in name with the branches of the\r\naxillary artery and terminates immediately beneath the clavicle at the\r\nouter margin of the first rib where it becomes the subclavian vein. To\r\nremove blood from the axillary vein, raise the vein to the surface,\r\nand insert the drainage tube. The Eckels-Genung steel drainage tube\r\nwill perhaps be the best tube to use. Insert the drain tube high up in\r\nthe arm pit, pass through the subclavian, to beyond the valve located\r\nin the subclavian vein outside the point at which the internal jugular\r\nvein unites with the subclavian to form the innominate. There being no\r\nmore valves the blood should pass out freely. If the blood does not\r\nflow, raise the axillary artery, begin the injection of fluid which\r\nwill tend to cause a pressure through the capillaries on the venous\r\nsystem pressing the blood back to the right auricle of the heart as\r\nin life, and as there is no obstructed passage the blood should flow\r\nfreely from the tube. The vein tube is of metal having a plunger rod\r\nwithin, and a Y attachment at the upper end. The blood runs from the\r\nY shaped attachment into a rubber tube which is connected with the\r\nblood bottle. A flexible arterial tube should be used in the artery,\r\nwhich will measure eight to ten inches in length and constructed with\r\na shut-off valve. The tube will reach the innominate artery close to\r\nthe arch of the aorta. With these arterial and drainage tubes the arms\r\ncan be folded and placed in position, with the hands over the abdomen\r\nand the tubes will extend out over the upper border of the arm. This\r\nmethod will enable the operator to inject the body and have the arms in\r\ntheir natural position. If a short circuit through the internal mammary\r\nvessels occurs, and this will be evidenced by the premature flow of\r\nthin blood, close the vein tube now and then during the operation,\r\ncontinuing the injection until the proper results are obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Removal of Blood from the Basilic Vein.=—To withdraw blood from\r\nthe basilic vein the left arm should be employed, because of a more\r\ndirect route to the right auricle. Make the incision in the middle\r\nor the upper third of the arm. The basilic vein lies in the upper arm\r\nand extends from the elbow to the shoulder, and can be found a short\r\ndistance from the brachial artery, either above or below, but generally\r\nbelow and toward the body. Its position is not always the same, owing\r\nto the many anomalies that might occur. As a rule the vein is quite\r\nlarge and prominent and when secured, raise to the surface freeing it\r\nfrom the surrounding tissues.\r\n\r\nPrepare two ligatures, make the incision in the vein and pass gently\r\nthe basilic drainage tube upward toward the heart. Either a steel or\r\nrubber tube may be used. If the flexible rubber tube is used, it will\r\nfind its way to the right auricle of the heart, its course is through\r\nthe basilic, axillary, sub-clavian, innominate, superior vena cava, to\r\nthe right auricle. Either the aspiration or the drainage methods may be\r\nused. If these fail try the displacement method.\r\n\r\nThe use of the basilic for the removal of blood is fast disappearing\r\nfrom general practice. Larger veins can be used, which will always\r\ninsure greater success.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Removal of Blood from the Internal Jugular Vein.=—The internal\r\njugular vein is the largest tributary vein in the body, and accompanies\r\nthe carotid artery. The operator will cut through the skin at a point\r\nfrom one half inch above the clavicle or collar bone and in the valley\r\nformed by the sterno-mastoid muscle to the outside and the muscles\r\nof the wind pipe to the inside, cut upward making the perpendicular\r\nincision. Raise both the artery and the vein according to the usual\r\nmethod. It seems best to raise the artery and the vein together, and\r\nby so doing this will tend to give added strength to the vein which is\r\nvery large but has quite thin walls.\r\n\r\nDirect the hook around the vein first then around the artery toward\r\nthe wind pipe or trachea, raise both to the surface, place on the\r\nbone separator, and remove the sheaths. Use any of the drainage tubes.\r\nInsert the vein drainage tube and the arterial tube, the point of both\r\ntubes being directed toward the heart. The injection should be made\r\nslowly, which will cause the blood to flow from the vein through the\r\ntube and into the blood bottle.\r\n\r\nThis vein is not as much used as the axillary or the femoral for the\r\nremoval of blood.\r\n\r\nIt is true that it is very close to the center of circulation and a\r\ngateway for the blood from the face. The chief disadvantage is that the\r\nvein lies quite deep, is very large and has such thin walls, that it is\r\nalmost impossible to raise it without a rupture.\r\n\r\nAbout one-thirteenth of the body's weight is calculated to be blood.\r\nGranting for the sake of argument that the average body that we\r\nwould desire to draw blood from would weigh 208 pounds, then that\r\naverage body would contain 16 pounds of blood. One pound of blood is\r\npractically equal to one pint, making the average body to contain about\r\n16 pints of blood.\r\n\r\nAfter death about one-fourth of the blood of the body is found in the\r\nportal system. The portal system has capillaries at both ends so that\r\nit is impossible to draw this blood.\r\n\r\nAfter death about one-fourth of the blood of the body is found in the\r\ntiny capillaries and tissues, blood which by the ordinary methods used\r\ntoday the embalmer is unable to draw.\r\n\r\nAfter death about one-fourth of the blood of the body is found in the\r\nazygos system, and points dependent in the body, which blood, too, it\r\nis impossible to draw.\r\n\r\nThis leaves about one-fourth of the blood of the body, which we are\r\nable to draw. One-fourth of 16 pints, is 4 pints which is the maximum\r\nwe can draw from the average body.\r\n\r\nThe point of this argument is that if from the average body you have\r\ntaken from two to four pints of pure undiluted blood, then you should\r\nbe satisfied. If the majority of this blood has been taken from the\r\nface you will get the desired cosmetic effect. The claims by some that\r\nthey are able to draw a gallon or more of blood is in our judgment\r\nerroneous, as we feel the blood has been greatly diluted. We have\r\ntested this out many times with the aid of control solutions and have\r\nfound that what the embalmer would ordinarily call thin blood was\r\ncomposed of from 10 to 30% blood and from 70 to 90% fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nTREATMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfectious Diseases\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF SPECIAL DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Anthrax.=—_Synonyms._—Malignant Pustule; Splenic Fever, Wool-sorter's\r\nDisease; Carbuncle; Charbons.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute infectious, non-contagious disease, caused by\r\nthe bacillus anthracis, and characterized by the formation of a boil\r\nwith a circumscribed, infiltrated base and dark center, and a systemic\r\ninfection of a severe type, the toxemia being of the gravest character.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The blood is dark, thick, diffluent, and rich in the\r\nspores of this disease.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Wash the body with 1 : 500 bichloride of mercury or 5%\r\ncarbolic acid. Inject the arteries, using 64 ounces of half strength\r\nfluid followed by enough normal fluid to secure preservation. Inject\r\nthe cavities with normal fluid. Drain blood from the veins, and\r\ndisinfect the blood before disposing of it. Close the openings of the\r\nbody. For transportation, govern yourself according to the provisions\r\nof the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cerebro-spinal Fever.=—_Synonyms._—Spotted fever; Cerebro-spinal\r\nmeningitis; Typhus syncopalis; Malignant purpuric fever.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, infectious non-contagious disease, occurs\r\nsporadically, epidemically and endemically characterized by hyperemia\r\nof the brain and spinal cord, and sometimes attended by a petechial\r\neruption.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The meningococcus intracellularis of Weichselbaum.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—In those cases that speedily prove fatal, there are\r\nlittle, if any, changes in the blood or tissues after death. Where\r\nthe disease has continued for several days, however, we find the\r\ncharacteristic suppurative exudation. The sinuses of the brain contain\r\nblood clots. Sometimes pus is found in the internal ear, and the\r\nchamber of the eye. The liver, spleen and kidneys are usually slightly\r\nengorged and somewhat softened. There occurs in quite a number of cases\r\na petechial eruption; the purpuric spots may be quite profuse, or but\r\none or two may be seen.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—As the means of ingress and egress of the infectious\r\nmaterial is not known, it is best that we give these cases a thorough\r\ntreatment; which should include a full arterial injection, drainage\r\nfrom the vein, injection of the cavities, and full care of the exposed\r\nportions of the body by washing same with a 1 : 500 solution of\r\nbichloride of mercury. The ears should be treated by packing them with\r\nabsorbent cotton saturated with the fluid or with bichloride of mercury\r\nsolution. The eyes should be carefully cleansed with a soft cloth or\r\nwith cotton saturated with bichloride of mercury solution. The arterial\r\ninjection should consume an amount of fluid equal to 10 per cent. of\r\nthe body weight. Give full cavity injection. Govern yourself by the\r\nregulations of your district for transportation of these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Erysipelas.=—_Synonym._—St. Anthony's fire.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An infectious, non-contagious disease, characterized\r\nby an acute and specific inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous\r\ntissues, attended by a shining redness, which spreads rapidly, marked\r\nswelling and pain, and which finally terminates in desquamation.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—This disease is supposed to be caused by the streptococcus\r\nerysipelatis.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The blood vessels are dilated and distended with\r\nblood, the cell infiltration may extend into the deeper tissues with\r\nsuppuration. The cocci are found in the lymph spaces of the affected\r\narea, also in the lymph vessels. There is a true dermatitis, involving\r\nthe skin, subcutaneous, and mucous surfaces.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Operator should wear rubber gloves. Wash the body\r\nexternally with 1 : 500 solution of bichloride of mercury using\r\nabsorbent cotton in the process. If crusts have formed bathe the spots\r\nwith sweet oil, which will soften them and which will allow you to\r\nremove them; destroying them by burning would be the best means of\r\ndisposal. If the face be the part affected, treat as above and then\r\napply the following solution to the part with lintine (Moadinger) or by\r\nsimple saturation: boric acid, one drachm; glycerine, one ounce; water,\r\nthree ounces.\r\n\r\nInject the first 64 ounces of fluid at half the normal strength,\r\ngradually strengthening the fluid until the tissues become firm. Drain\r\nblood freely from a large vein and disinfect the drawn blood before\r\ndisposing of it. Allow the softening solution mentioned above to remain\r\non the face until you are ready to place the body in the casket, when\r\nthe face can be dried and the usual cosmetic powders applied. Should\r\nthe peritoneum or the pleura be affected, inject the proper cavities\r\nwith very strong fluid. For transportation, govern yourself according\r\nto the provisions of your district rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Glanders.=—_Synonyms._—Farcy.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A specific, infectious, non-contagious disease of the\r\nhorse, communicable to man by inoculation, and characterized by the\r\nformation of nodules in the mucous membrane of the nose-glanders; and\r\nalso beneath the skin and lymph structures—farcy.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—In 1882, Loeffler and Schütz discovered the bacillus mallei\r\nwhich is the exciting cause of this disease. The infectious material\r\nis transmitted directly from horse to men, usually through an abraded\r\nsurface, and occurs most frequently among hostlers, veterinarians,\r\nfarmers, and those who come in contact with horses. It has been\r\ncommunicated from man to man, but this is rare.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—There are found nodules located in the nose, in which case\r\nthe disease is called glanders; or beneath the skin, in which case it\r\nis called farcy. These nodular masses discharge a yellow pus, which\r\nwill infect any abraded surface.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Disinfect the oral and nasal openings, and wash the body\r\nwith a good germicide. Give a thorough arterial injection, using half\r\nstrength fluid in the first bottle and normal thereafter. Drain blood\r\nfrom a large vein, disinfecting the blood before disposing of it. Give\r\na complete cavity injection. Close openings. For transportation, govern\r\nyourself according to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hydrophobia.=—_Synonyms._—Rabies.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A specific infectious, non-contagious disease peculiar\r\nto animals, especially the dog, and communicable to man by inoculation,\r\ngenerally by a bite. It is characterized in many by melancholia; great\r\nfear of water; violent spasms of the pharynx and larynx, rendering\r\ndeglutition and respiration very difficult; great prostration, a stage\r\nof paralysis, which generally terminates in death.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The specific cause has not been determined, though\r\nbacteriologists agree that it is of microbic origin.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The blood vessels of the cerebrospinal system are\r\ncongested.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Wash the body with 1 : 500 solution of bichloride of\r\nmercury, or 5% carbolic acid. Inject half strength fluid into a large\r\nartery for the first part, followed by enough normal fluid to secure\r\npreservation. Drain blood from the veins and disinfect the blood\r\nbefore disposing of it. If circulation to face and head is impaired\r\nthrough the cerebral congestion, open the common carotids and inject\r\nupward, draining from the internal jugular vein. Give thorough cavity\r\ninjection. Close all openings of the body. For transportation, govern\r\nyourself according to the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Relapsing Fever.=—_Synonyms._—Typhus recurrens; Bilious fever; Famine\r\nfever; Hunger pest; Spirillum fever.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, infectious and non-contagious disease,\r\ncharacterized by a series of exacerbations and remissions, each lasting\r\nfrom five to seven days, and prevailing epidemically.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The spirillum of Obermeier.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—There is no characteristic change in the solids of the\r\nbody. There is sometimes icteric discoloration during the disease and\r\nthe tissues are stained after death. The liver, kidneys and spleen are\r\nsomewhat enlarged. The heart becomes soft. The body retains its heat a\r\nlong time after death and the blood coagulates slowly if at all.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Arterial injection with half strength fluid, followed, in\r\nthe second and third parts, with normal fluid. Drainage of blood. Spray\r\nfluid over abdominal viscera, through the usual puncture.\r\n\r\nFor transportation of bodies dead of this disease, govern yourself\r\naccording to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Syphilis.=—_Synonyms._—Pox; mal-venereal; lues venereal.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A specific infectious, non-contagious disease, weeks\r\nor months are occupied in its development; contracted by inoculation\r\nwhich is known as acquired syphilis, or hereditary, which is congenital\r\nsyphilis, and is characterized by three distinct stages; primary,\r\nsecondary, tertiary.\r\n\r\n_History._—”In all probability syphilis is as old as the human race;\r\nfor we can readily believe that illicit intercourse was practiced in\r\nthe cities of the ancient world when the morals of the people were more\r\nlax than those of today. Our knowledge of the disease, however, dates\r\nfrom the fifteenth century. Breaking out among the troops of Charles\r\nVIII, King of France, it rapidly spread over Europe. From then to\r\nthe present day our knowledge of the disease has grown, till today we\r\nare able to classify and separate the various lesions resulting from\r\nillicit and promiscuous intercourse. All forms of venereal disease were\r\nincluded under the name of syphilis till Ricord, in 1831, demonstrated\r\nthat gonorrhea and syphilis were two distinct diseases.”\r\n\r\n_Etiology._—Predisposing causes are injuries or abrasions of the mucous\r\nsurfaces of exposed parts, for the disease can originate in only one\r\nway, by inoculation.\r\n\r\n_Modes of Infection._—There are three modes of infection; illicit\r\nintercourse, heredity and accidental. Of these the embalmer need only\r\nconsider the accidental form of infection.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The initial lesion is the chancre, the secondary lesions\r\nare ulceration of the mucous surfaces and cutaneous eruptions, and the\r\ntertiary lesions are inflammatory products known as gummata, and are\r\nfound upon the bones and periosteum, or in the skin, muscles, liver,\r\nkidneys, lung, heart, brain; in fact in any of the viscera of the body.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Wash body thoroughly with 5% carbolic acid or 1 : 500\r\nsolution of bichloride of mercury. Work with rubber gloves. Inject half\r\nstrength fluid for the first 64 ounces of fluid and follow that with\r\nnormal fluid until disinfection and preservation are assured. Give the\r\nbody a complete cavity injection with normal fluid. Drain blood from\r\na large vein, and disinfect the blood before disposing of it. Close\r\nall openings of the body with absorbent cotton saturated with normal\r\nfluid. Bandage any large sores and saturate the bandage with normal\r\nfluid. When purpura (characterized by a blue spot on the face) exists,\r\nthe discoloration cannot be removed. If anything is to be done at all\r\nfor the discoloration, it must be of the nature of a covering for the\r\nspot, such as paint or other cosmetics. For transportation of the body,\r\ngovern yourself according to the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tetanus.=—_Synonyms._—Lockjaw; Trismus.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute infectious, non-contagious disease,\r\ncharacterized by painful spasmodic contraction of the voluntary\r\nmuscles, most frequently those of the jaw, face, and neck; less\r\nfrequently those of the trunk, the extensors of the spine and limbs.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The cause is recognized as the bacillus tetanus.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The infection usually enters by way of a wound, especially\r\nof the hands and feet, and a punctured wound rather than an incised\r\none. The post-mortem lesions are not constant.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The body should receive a complete arterial injection\r\nusing half strength fluid for the first part of the injection, followed\r\nby sufficient normal fluid to secure preservation and disinfection.\r\nBlood should be drained from the veins and should be disinfected before\r\nbeing disposed of. Wash the wound with 1 : 500 solution of bichloride\r\nof mercury and bandage it to avoid infection from it. Inject the\r\ncavities of the body. Close the openings. For transportation, govern\r\nyourself according to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Actinomycosis.=—_Synonyms._—Big Jaw; Lumpy Jaw.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A specific infectious, non-contagious disease of domestic\r\nanimals, particularly cattle, communicable to man, and caused by the\r\nray-fungus.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—Infection takes place, as a rule, through the mouth,\r\nthrough a cut or abrasion of the skin and rarely through the\r\nrespiratory tract. The fungus produces a tumor, with a rapid\r\nproliferation of the neighboring connective tissue. The disease is not\r\nlimited to any organ as the name lumpy jaw would imply; we may have\r\nactinomycosis of the lung, digestive tract, and of the skin.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Disinfect the outside of the body by washing with a good\r\ngermicide. Care should be exercised against inoculation through an\r\nabrasion of the skin. Give the body a thorough arterial injection,\r\ndraining blood, and disinfecting the blood before disposing of it.\r\nClose all openings. For transportation, govern yourself according to\r\nthe provisions of the transportation laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dengue.=—_Synonyms._—Break-bone fever; dandy fever; broken-wing fever.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, specific, infectious, non-contagious fever,\r\noccurring epidemically in tropical and subtropical climates and\r\ncharacterized by two severe paroxysms of fever, separated by an\r\nintermission, great muscular pain, and usually attended by an eruption.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The nature of the infection or contagion is not known. That it\r\nis infectious is shown by the rapidity with which it spreads when once\r\nit invades a section. In 1885, within a few weeks, sixteen thousand,\r\nin Austin, Texas, were stricken. Neither age, sex, race, nor position\r\nexert an influence in staying the disease.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—As few cases prove fatal, but little opportunity has ever\r\nbeen given to study its pathological character. There has been found\r\ninfiltration of the tissues about the joints. It is rare for a case to\r\nend fatally, only few succumbing to its influence. For this reason the\r\nembalmer will not have many of these cases to treat.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—As this rarely comes excepting in the epidemic form,\r\nthat form will be treated on. The body should be washed with a good\r\ngermicide, and all openings should be closed with absorbent cotton. The\r\nbody should then receive a very heavy arterial injection, with drainage\r\nof blood, and cavity injection. As is the case in epidemics, the body\r\nshould be buried as soon as possible. While the mortality is light, yet\r\nthe most strenuous treatment should be given to assist in the campaign\r\nof the health authorities against the disease and its spread. When more\r\nis known about the characteristics of the disease, it is likely that a\r\nmore definite treatment can be advised.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Malarial Fever.=—_Synonyms._—Ague; Chills and fever; Intermittent\r\nfever; Swamp fever; Marsh fever; Paludal fever.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A specific, infectious, although non-contagious disease,\r\ncaused by the hematozoa of Lavaran, and consisting of two distinct\r\nparts; first, a succession of exacerbations and intermissions, or a\r\nseries of short fevers separated by short intervals of health; second,\r\na continued fever made up of exacerbations and remissions, there being\r\nbut one cold stage.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The hematozoa of Lavaran.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—There is a destruction of the red blood corpuscles, due\r\nto the action of the parasite. There is an increase of pigment, in the\r\nspleen, liver, kidneys, bone marrow, skin, and in fact, in all the\r\ntissues, due to the conversion of hemoglobin into pigment granules.\r\nThe spleen is enlarged as are also the liver and the kidneys. The skin\r\npresents a jaundiced appearance in chronic malarial fever.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Arterial injection of 64 oz. 1% solution of borax or\r\noxalic acid followed by 64 oz. of half strength fluid and then a\r\nsufficient quantity of normal fluid to complete preservation. Drainage\r\nof blood and solution to wash stain from capillaries. Application of\r\nfull strength peroxide hydrogen to face, and massage during injection.\r\n\r\nFor transportation of bodies dead of this disease, govern yourself\r\naccording to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yellow Fever.=—_Synonyms._—Typhus ichteroides; Febris flava; Black\r\nvomit; Yellow jack.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, infectious, though non-contagious disease of\r\nthe tropics or sub-tropics, characterized by a high grade of fever,\r\nlasting from two to seven days, tenderness over the epigastrium\r\n(stomach), vomiting of black, broken down blood, and yellow\r\ndiscoloration of the skin.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—Not known, although it is definitely known that the infection\r\nis spread through the bite of a species of mosquito, the stegomyia\r\nfasciata.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The skin and the mucous membranes show a varying degree\r\nof jaundice, from a light yellow to a dark brownish or orange color;\r\nthe color deepening over the course of the blood vessels. The stomach\r\ncontains more or less of broken down blood, the so-called black vomit.\r\nThe blood is dark and broken down.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Arterial injection of 64 oz., of half strength fluid\r\nfollowed by sufficient normal fluid to assure disinfection and\r\npreservation. Drainage of contents from vein and massage of face with\r\nfull strength hydrogen peroxide in an attempt to clear the complexion.\r\nFull abdominal cavity treatment, and close orifices of the body.\r\n\r\nFor transportation of bodies dead of this disease, govern yourself\r\naccording to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Diphtheria.=—_Synonyms._—Diphtheritis; angina maligna; membranous\r\ncroup.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute infectious, contagious disease characterized by\r\na grayish-white, fibrinous exudate, usually located on the tonsils or\r\nthe neighboring tissues.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—This is the bacillus diphtheriae, although some still hold\r\nthat the specific cause has not as yet been determined.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—In the severe forms the deeper connective tissues are\r\ninvolved, and there may be extensive destruction of tissue, including\r\nthe blood-vessels. There is more or less discoloration of the tissues\r\nfrom extravasation of the coloring matter. The kidneys and spleen\r\nmay be enlarged. The blood is more or less broken down, the fibrin is\r\ndeficient.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Disinfect the oral and nasal cavities with the embalming\r\nfluid. Wash the body externally with 1 : 500 solution of bichloride\r\nof mercury. Inject an amount of fluid equaling 10% of the body weight\r\ninto the arteries, and give cavity injection. Drain blood and inject\r\nadditional fluid to make up for that which will be lost in drainage.\r\nIn young persons the strength of the fluid for the first 64 ounces of\r\nthe injection should be cut to half of the normal strength. Close all\r\nopenings of the body with absorbent cotton. Dress the body and then\r\nplace it in the casket, drawing the glass slide and closing it, after\r\nwhich, it should not be re-opened. Abide by the regulations of your\r\ndistrict concerning the amount of time to elapse between the time of\r\ndeath and of burial in these cases. For transportation govern yourself\r\naccording to the provisions of your district rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tuberculosis.=—_Definition._—An infectious, slightly contagious\r\ndisease, characterized by the formation of small nodules, tubercles,\r\nvarying from the size of a millet-seed to that of a mustard-seed or\r\neven larger.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—Tubercle bacillus of Koch.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—Any organ of the body may be the seat of the disease. In\r\nthe adult the lungs are the most frequently affected, while in children\r\nthe lymph glands, joints, and intestines are favorable seats for the\r\ndisease. Probably the only form that will give the embalmer any trouble\r\nis tuberculosis of the lungs. Here either from the poison, developed by\r\nthe bacilli, or from some other source, necrosis of the cells occurs,\r\nforming a cheesy condition known as caseation. At a later period\r\nthis breaks down, forming an abscess, the cavity being filled with a\r\npurulent material. At other times there is a calcareous deposit, and\r\nthe tubercular mass is said to undergo calcification.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—In pulmonary tuberculosis, give the body a complete\r\narterial injection using half strength fluid for the first part of\r\nthe injection, followed by three-fourths strength for the latter part.\r\nHohenschuh prefers to drain blood from all cases; the authors prefer\r\nto drain blood in tuberculosis, only when it is necessary as a means of\r\npreventing discolorations, and that would be in case the blood vessels\r\ncontained much blood. Massage the face carefully with one of the\r\ncommercial solutions, or, with water which of course has no bleaching\r\naction. For transportation, govern yourself according to the provisions\r\nof the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Typhoid Fever.=—_Synonyms._—Typhus abdominalis; Typhus nervosus;\r\nIleo-typhus and Autumnal fever, are the most common terms, although\r\nMurchison's list includes forty others.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, infectious and slightly contagious disease,\r\nderived from a specific cause and characterized by inflammation and\r\ngenerally sloughing of Peyer's glands, swelling of the mesentery,\r\nengorgement of the spleen and a rose colored eruption.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—A specific germ called the bacillus of Eberth or the bacillus\r\ntyphosus.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The lesions resulting from this disease may be divided\r\ninto two parts. First, the lesions of the intestinal canal, Peyer's\r\npatches, the solitary glands of the ileum and caecum, and more rarely\r\nof the colon and the rectum, and changes in the spleen. Secondly,\r\nthose lesions resulting from sepsis occurring during the long period\r\nof fever, and affecting the tissues and organs at large. The first\r\neffect of the poison or bacilli is to cause hyperemia (swelling) of\r\nthe lymphatics, the capillaries become engorged and cell infiltration\r\ntakes place in the solitary glands of the intestines. Frequently the\r\ninfiltration is so excessive that the capillaries become engorged and\r\nentirely choked with the infiltration. Ulcers form, which are shallow\r\nor deep, according to the amount of necrosis (sloughing), and when very\r\ndeep, perforation of the bowel may follow, although this condition is\r\nrare. The spleen is nearly always involved, congestion takes place,\r\nfollowed by softening. The liver becomes hyperemic, swollen and soft,\r\nand often shows abscess formation. There is granular degeneration in\r\nthe kidney, ulceration of the larynx and sometimes congestion of the\r\nlung. The heart muscles too often become weakened the result of the\r\npoison.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—If death occurs early in the disease, the body will not\r\nbe greatly emaciated, and the following treatment may be followed in\r\ndetail:\r\n\r\nIf intense abdominal fermentation exists, relieve the accumulated gas\r\nwith trocar, aspirate as much serous matter as possible from the pelvic\r\ncavity, introduce a strong fluid into the cavity, taking care to have\r\nas much of this fluid reach the cavities of the intestines as possible.\r\nOpen one of the arteries commonly used in one of the drainage processes\r\nand inject 64 ounces of half strength fluid, draining blood from\r\nthe vein simultaneously with the injection. Then inject a sufficient\r\nquantity of normal fluid to complete preservation. Close all openings\r\nof the body with absorbent cotton. Massage the face with water or a\r\ncommercial solution during the injection.\r\n\r\nIf death occurs late in the disease, the abdomen may require a stronger\r\ntreatment such as we would give in acute peritonitis. The trocar may\r\nnot prove efficient in reaching the affected parts and in such a case\r\nwe would make a 4 inch incision along the median line and between the\r\numbilicus and the pubic arch, exposing the ileum and caecum, which\r\nshould be incised, their contents removed, and then all replaced in\r\nthe cavity thoroughly surrounded with hardening compound. After this\r\nthe wound should be closed with stitches. After preservation has been\r\ncompleted in either this form of the disease or the one mentioned\r\nabove, dust on a good quality of face powder to remove the moist\r\nappearance from the skin. When a body dead of this disease is to\r\nbe transported, consult the state or local transportation rules in\r\naddition to these treatments.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Leprosy.=—_Definition._—A chronic, infectious, contagious disease,\r\nwhich usually terminates fatally.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The bacillus leprae. There are tuberculous growths in the\r\nskin, which push outward, form nodular masses, between which are seen\r\nareas of ulceration and cicatrization, which in the face, distort the\r\nfeatures. These tubercular masses discharge a thick purulent material.\r\nThe destruction of tissue proceeds gradually, years being occupied in\r\ndestroying a patient. The deep, ulcerative process may amputate fingers\r\nand toes in its progressive march.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The body is rarely presentable for sometime before death,\r\nand this should not be a consideration in our treatment. If an arterial\r\ninjection is possible, give it, using normal fluid for the injection.\r\nWork with rubber gloves. Give a complete cavity injection. Wrap the\r\nbody in absorbent cotton and then in a sheet. For transportation,\r\ngovern yourself according to the provisions of the transportation\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Influenza.=—_Synonyms._—Epidemic catarrhal fever; la grippe.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, infectious disease, the contagion of which is\r\nquestionable occurring pandemically.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The bacillus influenza.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—There is no characteristic lesion in the uncomplicated\r\ncase. When death occurs it is usually from complication.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Disinfect the oral and nasal cavities with embalming\r\nfluid. Inject as much fluid as you can into the arteries and cavities.\r\nThe usual 10% of the body weight must be given for transportation.\r\nIf blood vessels are filled with blood, drain from a large vein, and\r\nadd more fluid to your injection, to make up for the loss of blood\r\nto the blood bottle. Close all openings with absorbent cotton. For\r\ntransportation, govern yourself according to the provisions of your\r\ndistrict rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cholera.=—_Synonyms._—Cholera Algida; Cholera Asiatica; Cholera\r\nmaligna.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—Cholera is an acute, specific, infectious slightly\r\ncontagious disease, occurring epidemically and endemically, and\r\ncharacterized by severe vomiting and copious watery stools, violent\r\ncramping of the muscles and collapse.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The exciting cause is now generally recognized as the comma\r\nbacillus of Koch, or spirillum cholerae.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The tissues after death are shrunken and drawn, and\r\nthe extremities are inclined to be mottled; in some cases there is\r\na postmortem rise of temperature. Rigor mortis sets in very early.\r\nSpasmodic contractions sometimes occur for some moments after death;\r\nhence the eyes and jaws have been seen to move after life was extinct.\r\nOwing to this marked contraction, the limbs have been distorted and\r\nthe partial turning of the body is thus accounted for, and is not, as\r\nmany have supposed, the result of being buried alive. The tissues are\r\ndry, having been drained of these fluids before death, hence some time\r\nelapses before decomposition begins after death. The chief visceral\r\nlesion is that of the intestinal canal. The intestines contain a more\r\nor less quantity of rice-water, fluid rich in the comma bacillus. The\r\nblood is very dark, but slightly coagulable and robbed of its salts and\r\nfluids.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Arterial and cavity embalming, closing all orifices of the\r\nbody. Any discharges from the bowels should be disinfected before being\r\ndisposed of. In epidemics, cosmetic effect is a non-essential and in\r\nthat case the most thorough treatment must be given without regard to\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\nFor transportation of bodies dead of this disease, govern yourself\r\naccording to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bubonic Plague.=—_Synonyms._—The Pest; Black Death; Plague of Egypt.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A specific, infectious, contagious disease, running\r\na rapid course, and characterized by inflammation of the glands\r\n(buboes), carbuncles, ecchymoses, and petechiae upon the surface. It is\r\nendemic on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea and the Oriental\r\ncountries adjacent. Epidemics occur when it spreads to other parts\r\nof the world, traveling along the great thoroughfares of travel and\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—To Kitasato belongs the honor of discovering the specific\r\ncause, the bacillus pestis. On entering the body, either by inoculation\r\nor by way of the digestive or respiratory tracts, it multiplies with\r\ngreat rapidity. It is found in the blood, in the internal organs, in\r\nthe intestinal canal, lymphatic glands and in great numbers in the\r\nsuppurating buboes.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—Rigor mortis occurs early, and often there is elevation\r\nof temperature immediately after death. Petechiae, ecchymoses, and\r\ncarbuncles are generally found upon the skin. The lymphatic system is\r\ngenerally affected, the lymph glands of the groin and axilla showing\r\nevidence of inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Wash the body thoroughly with a good germicide, close all\r\nopenings, first however, disinfect the oral and nasal openings. Nothing\r\nshould be done for the ecchymotic spots, the cosmetic effect in these\r\ncases being secondary to disinfection. The arteries should receive a\r\nheavy injection of normal fluid, blood being drained from the veins.\r\nThe blood should be disinfected before being disposed of. The cavities\r\nshould receive a heavy injection of normal fluid. For transportation\r\nof these cases, govern yourself according to the provisions of the\r\ntransportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scarlet Fever.=—_Synonyms._—Scarlatina; scarlet rash.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, contagious disease, characterized by a bright\r\nscarlet colored eruption, diffused over the entire body, terminating by\r\ndesquamation of the skin.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—Not definitely known, although thought by Klein and Gordon to\r\nbe the streptococcus scarlatinae.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The blood is dark, diffluent, and does not coagulate\r\nreadily, owing to a defect in the fibrin. The eruption disappears after\r\ndeath, except in those malignant cases where the eruption failed to\r\nappear during life, and appears upon the death of the patient.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—First protect yourself by wearing a bandage of surgical\r\ngauze over your mouth and nose, then enter the room of death and\r\nwash the body thoroughly with a 1 : 500 solution of bichloride of\r\nmercury. Inject an amount of fluid equaling 10% of the body weight\r\ninto the arteries and inject into the cavities. Drain blood through\r\none of the drainage processes, and add an amount of fluid to the\r\narterial injection equal to that which is lost to the blood bottle.\r\nClose all openings with absorbent cotton, dress the body, and then\r\nplace it in the casket, drawing the glass slide and closing it, after\r\nwhich, it should not be reopened. Abide by the regulations of your\r\ndistrict concerning the amount of time to elapse between the time of\r\ndeath and of burial in these cases. For intra-state and inter-state\r\ntransportation, govern yourself according to the provisions of your\r\ndistrict rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Variola.=—_Synonyms._—Small-pox; German Blattern; French, La Petite\r\nVerole.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A specific, infectious, highly contagious febrile\r\ndisease, characterized by a dermatitis, in which the eruption passes\r\nfrom the papule to vesicle, and this in turn into pustule, finally\r\ndessicating.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The true nature of the virus is not known, and although\r\ncertain microorganisms have been described which are found in the pock,\r\nthere is no proof that they are responsible for producing the poison.\r\nAll that is positively known is, that it is developed in the system and\r\nreproduced in the pustule.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The most marked change occurs in the skin, where an\r\neruption takes place, finally with the formation of scabs or crusts.\r\nThe blood does not reveal any microscopic changes, although darkened in\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—No one but an immune should handle these cases, and he\r\nshould first wash the body with a 1 : 500 solution of bichloride of\r\nmercury. After this has been done, inject an amount of fluid equal\r\nto 10 per cent. of the body weight, distributing same by arterial\r\ninjection. If blood is drained, and it is proper to do so, add fluid\r\nto the injection to make up the loss into the blood bottle. Give full\r\ncavity injection. Bodies dead of this disease should be buried within a\r\nreasonably short length of time, so that the apartments may be rendered\r\nsafe by fumigation, and under no circumstances should a public funeral\r\nbe held. After the body has been placed in the casket, the slide,\r\npreferably of glass, should be closed and should not be reopened under\r\nany circumstances. Govern yourself by the regulations of your district\r\nfor transportation of these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Measles.=—_Synonyms._—Morbilli; rubeola.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, infectious, contagious fever, characterized by\r\na general papular eruption.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The efforts to isolate a specific germ which will produce the\r\ndisease has thus far failed, though many organisms have been found in\r\nthe secretions.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—There is a lack of coagulability of the blood, which is\r\ndark in color. The internal organs are congested and softened. The\r\nlesion of the skin consists of an acute hyperemia with exudation in the\r\nvascular papillae of the corium, the sebaceous and sweat glands.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Bodies rarely die from this cause; the usual immediate\r\ncause of death is exhaustion. An injection of half strength fluid\r\nfor the first part of the injection followed by normal fluid for the\r\nbalance of the injection, with full cavity injection, closing the\r\norifices is all that is necessary. For transportation, govern yourself\r\naccording to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parotitis.=—_Synonyms._—Mumps, epidemic parotitis.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, infectious, and contagious disease,\r\ncharacterized by an inflammation of one or both of the parotid glands.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The specific cause is a contagion generated during the course\r\nof the disease, the exact nature of which is not known, although\r\nthought by some to be the tetrad of mumps.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The parotid glands become swollen and hard. Death very\r\nseldom occurs from this disease.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Disinfect the oral cavity with embalming fluid. The\r\nswelling cannot be reduced, so that the next concern to the embalmer\r\nwill be to preserve the body. This should be done by injecting 64\r\nounces of half strength fluid, followed by enough normal fluid to\r\nsecure preservation. If blood vessels contain much blood, drain from a\r\nlarge vein, and then inject additional fluid to make up for that lost\r\nby drainage. Close all openings with absorbent cotton. Abide by the\r\nregulations of your state governing the transportation of these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pertussis.=—_Synonyms._—Whooping-cough; tussis convulsiva.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A specific infectious, contagious disease occurring\r\nepidemically, and characterized by a peculiar, spasmodic cough, ending\r\nin a whoop.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The cause of whooping-cough has always been a matter of\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—In the uncomplicated form there is no lesion which can be\r\nsaid to be characteristic. There might in complications be hemorrhage\r\nfrom the lung.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Disinfect the oral and nasal cavities with embalming\r\nfluid. Inject 64 ounces of half strength fluid followed by enough\r\nnormal fluid to secure preservation. If blood vessels contain much\r\nblood, drain from a large vein, and then inject additional fluid to\r\nmake up for that lost by drainage. Close all openings with absorbent\r\ncotton. Discourage public funerals in these cases. For intra-state or\r\ninter-state transportation of these cases, govern yourself according to\r\nthe provisions of your district rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Typhus Fever.=—_Synonyms._—Famine fever; Ship fever; Jail fever;\r\nHospital fever; and Putrid fever.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, infectious, very contagious, endemic, and also\r\nepidemic disease, characterized by a high grade of fever and a peculiar\r\nrash.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—Not known.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The blood is dark and diffluent the result of the\r\nintense fever and rapid work of the poison. The liver is somewhat\r\nenlarged and softened, as are also the kidneys and spleen. There is\r\nan extravasation into the pericardium which gives it an ecchymotic\r\nappearance. There is also a slight engorgement and infiltration of the\r\ncapillaries. The muscular tissues are of a dark red color. The skin\r\nshows a characteristic rash and ecchymotic spots are found on the more\r\ndependent parts of the body after death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Slow arterial injection and drainage of blood. On account\r\nof rash, apply bichloride of mercury 1 : 500. In the presence of\r\nfermentation, give the abdomen a special treatment.\r\n\r\nFor transportation of bodies dead of this disease, govern yourself\r\naccording to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Varicella.=—_Synonym._—Chicken-pox.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An acute, specific, and infectious disease, characterized\r\nby an eruption that rapidly passes through the stage of papule,\r\nvesicle, and pustule, and terminates by dessication.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—This is not known. All attempts to isolate the microorganisms\r\nor the contagium, whatever that may be, have failed.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The only pathological lesion is the eruption that appears\r\non the skin.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—These cases should be thoroughly washed with 1 : 500\r\nsolution of bichloride of mercury, after which a thorough arterial and\r\ncavity injection should be given, consuming for this purpose an amount\r\nof fluid equal to 10 per cent. of the body weight in the arteries.\r\nBlood should be drained from the veins, and an amount of fluid equal to\r\nwhat is lost to the blood bottle should be injected in addition to the\r\n10 per cent. mentioned above. After the body is placed in the casket,\r\nclose the slide which should be of glass, and do not reopen again.\r\nPublic funerals of these cases should be discouraged, to avoid the\r\nindiscriminate transfer of the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Septicemia.=—_Definition._—A morbid process commonly known as blood\r\npoisoning, in which there is an invasion of the blood by bacteria or\r\ntheir toxins.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—Any bacteria or its toxin.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The blood is found to be dark, diffluent, and rich in\r\nbacteria. The liver and spleen are soft, dark in color, and show\r\nswelling. The lymphatics are also swollen.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The operator should approach these cases with unbroken\r\nskin on his hands, or if that be impossible, with rubber gloves,\r\nas the disease is disseminated through abrasions. Take up a large\r\nartery and vein, inject half strength fluid for the first bottle and\r\nnormal fluid thereafter in the arteries, and drain from the veins.\r\nDisinfect the blood obtained from the vein before disposing of\r\nit. Give the body a complete cavity injection. Massage the face to\r\nstimulate capillary circulation while the arterial injection is being\r\nmade. For transportation, govern yourself according to your district\r\ntransportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pyemia.=—_Definition._—An infectious disease due to the absorption\r\nof animal poisons, principally pyogenic organisms, and characterized\r\nby the formation, in the various tissues and organs, of multiple\r\nmetastatic abscesses.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—One of the forms or a combination of pyogenic micrococci are\r\nheld to be responsible, for this condition. The streptococcus and the\r\nstaphylococcus are the forms most common, though it is not uncommon\r\nto find the micrococcus lanciolatus, the gonococcus, the bacillus coli\r\ncommunis, bacillus typhosis, bacillus pyocyaneus, and many others.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The body does not undergo putrefaction as rapidly as in\r\nsepticemia. The first effects of the morbid changes are found in the\r\nveins, which result in thrombi. These thrombi are found in the various\r\norgans and tissues of the body.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Use the precautions observed in the treatment for\r\nsepticemia. Give the body a complete arterial injection using half\r\nstrength fluid for the first bottle of the injection. Drain as much\r\nblood from the veins as possible. Thrombi may complicate the drainage,\r\nand if none can be obtained from several of the larger veins, tap the\r\nheart as a last resort. Disinfect the blood before disposing of it.\r\nStreptococcus infection of the embalmer from abrasions of the skin is\r\nvery dangerous and every possible precaution should be carefully taken.\r\nGive the body a complete cavity injection. For transportation, govern\r\nyourself according to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF SPECIAL DISEASES.—Continued.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gangrene of the Lung.=—_Definition._—A putrefactive necrosis of the\r\nlung.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—Many putrefactive bacteria thrive in the necrotic soil, but\r\nwhether they are the cause or the result is not known.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—When the gangrene is due to the plugging of one of the\r\nlarge branches of the pulmonary artery, a large part of the lung\r\nbecomes dark, greenish brown, or a black fetid mass, softening rapidly\r\nin the center, forming an irregular cavity, containing a foul-smelling\r\ndisgusting, greenish fluid.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Give complete arterial injection. Inject the pleural sac\r\non the affected side through the first intercostal space or through\r\nthe apex of the cavity. Spray fluid into the mouth and nose and close\r\nthem with absorbent cotton. For shipment of these cases govern yourself\r\naccording to the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pulmonary Hemorrhage.=—_Synonyms._—Hemoptysis; Broncho-pulmonary\r\nhemorrhage; Bronchorrhagia; Pneumorrhagia.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An expectoration of blood, due to hemorrhage from the\r\nmucous membrane of the bronchi, trachea, or larynx and from erosion or\r\nrupture of capillaries in lung cavities.\r\n\r\n_Cause._—The hemorrhage may result from congestion of the lungs,\r\ndue either to pulmonary lesions or from cardiac derangements. It may\r\naccompany malignant affections, infectious fevers, scurvy, cancer of\r\nthe lung, gangrene, and abscess of the lung.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—There is, in most cases rupture of the capillaries of\r\nthe bronchial mucous membranes. If tubercular cavities are formed, a\r\nruptured aneurism is sometimes seen, or large blood vessel eroded by\r\nulceration. If pulmonary apoplexy has existed, the parenchyma may be\r\nlacerated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Some operators wait until fluid passes from the mouth\r\nbefore taking steps to stop the hemorrhage due to the injection of\r\nfluid. We prefer to use plaster of paris and cotton, making a paste\r\nof them and forcing the paste down upon the epiglottis to prevent the\r\nwaste of fluid from that source. When the cause of death is known, this\r\noperation must be done before the injection is begun or the throat will\r\nhave to be dried out before the plaster of paris will set properly.\r\nAnother treatment to prevent the leakage of fluid would be to tie off\r\nthe trachea just above the upper border of the sternum.\r\n\r\nThe body is usually emaciated and should be injected arterially with\r\ncomparatively mild fluid, in order to avoid drying or dessication of\r\nthe features. Whenever fermentation exists in the abdomen, the cavity\r\nshould be injected; otherwise it is not usually necessary. The amount\r\nof fluid for the injection should be based on the amount that will\r\nbe taken by the vessels of a body the size of the one being injected.\r\nFor transportation of these cases the provisions of the transportation\r\nrules should be your guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pulmonary Abscess.=—_Synonyms._—Abscess of the lungs; Suppurative\r\npneumonitis.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A collection of pus in the lung, accompanied by\r\ndegeneration of tissue.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The abscess may involve one or more lobules, or engage\r\nalmost the entire lobe, or the abscesses may be scattered throughout\r\nthe whole lung.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Should hemorrhage occur, treat this case the same as for\r\npulmonary hemorrhage. If no hemorrhage occurs, give the body a complete\r\ninjection with a mild fluid and inject the pleural sacs from the first\r\nintercostal space or the apex of the cavity. For transportation, govern\r\nyourself according to the provisions of the transportation laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pneumonia.=—This disease is divided into different subdivisions as\r\nfollows: Lobar Pneumonia, broncho-pneumonia, and chronic interstitial\r\npneumonia.\r\n\r\n(A) _Lobar Pneumonia._—_Synonyms._—Croupous or Fibrinous Pneumonia;\r\nPneumonitis; Inflammation of the lungs; and Winter fever.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—This is an acute infectious disease characterized by an\r\ninflammation of the lung tissue in which there is, first, congestion\r\nand engorgement, second, exudation or consolidation; and third,\r\nresolution or suppuration.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The right lung is more frequently affected than the left,\r\nand one lobe, or one entire lung, rather than both lungs at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Should suppuration occur, turn the body on its side, press\r\non the sternum and cause the suppurative matter to leave the windpipe\r\nby purging it into the folds of a towel which should be placed at the\r\nmouth. Spray the mouth with fluid and close the oral and nasal cavities\r\nwith absorbent cotton.\r\n\r\nGive the body a thorough arterial and cavity injection, paying especial\r\nattention to the pleural sacs, which should be injected independently\r\nfrom the first intercostal space on each side or from the apex of the\r\ncavity. Drain blood and disinfect the contents of the blood bottle\r\nbefore disposing of same. For transportation, govern yourself according\r\nto the provisions of the transportation laws.\r\n\r\n(B) _Broncho-Pneumonia_—_Synonyms._—Capillary Bronchitis; Lobular\r\nPneumonia; Catarrhal Pneumonia.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An inflammation of the terminal bronchi, air vesicles,\r\nand interstitial tissue of a few or many of the lobules.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The interstitial tissue between the air cells and the\r\ncapillaries are greatly weakened. In most cases the lung will float\r\nwhen placed in water, though the small mahogany-colored nodules found\r\ndistributed throughout the lung when excised sink in water.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The nature of the disease is such that preservation is\r\ncomparatively simple, the disease affecting the extremities of the\r\nrespiratory system. Arterial injection together with special attention\r\nto the pleural sacs will suffice for the cases. For transportation,\r\ngovern yourself according to the provisions of the transportation\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n(C) _Chronic Interstitial Pneumonia._—_Synonyms._—Cirrhosis of the\r\nlungs; Fibroid Pneumonia.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A chronic inflammation of the lungs, in which the normal\r\nair cells are replaced by fibrous or connective tissue, followed by\r\ninduration and atrophy of the lung.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The disease is nearly always confined to one lung, though,\r\nin very rare cases, both lungs may be involved, while localized areas\r\nare the rule. The affected lung becomes atrophied and in extreme cases,\r\nmay be no larger than the closed hand. As a result of the shrinkage of\r\nthe lung tissue, the heart undergoes hypertrophy. When tuberculosis\r\nexists, cavities of varying size and number are found, and the\r\ninterstitial tissue between the capillaries and the air cells is very\r\nmuch weakened.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Should this disease be followed by a rupture of the\r\ncapillaries during the injection, thereby causing a hemorrhage\r\nfrom the oral and nasal openings, treat it as you would a case of\r\npulmonary hemorrhage. Otherwise give the body a thorough arterial\r\nand cavity injection with special attention to the pleural sacs. For\r\ntransportation, govern yourself according to the provisions of the\r\ntransportation laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hydrothorax.=—_Synonyms._—Thoracic dropsy; Dropsy of the chest; Dropsy\r\nof the pleura.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A collection of serous fluid within the pleural cavity\r\nwithout inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—Hydrothorax, unless due to cardiac affections, is usually\r\nbilateral. The quantity of fluid varies, and is generally greater on\r\none side than on the other. The fluid is free, and of a low specific\r\ngravity, alkaline in character, clear, and of an amber color.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—To prevent the formation of blisters on the posterior\r\nsurface of the thorax, aspirate the serous fluid from the pleural\r\nsacs, introducing the trocar through the apex of the cavity, and\r\nextending it into the cavity until it has almost reached the diaphragm.\r\nThis must be done with both the right and left sacs. Give the body a\r\ncomplete injection, using normal fluid throughout the entire injection.\r\nInject the pleural sacs after the serous fluid has been withdrawn.\r\nFor prevention of post-operative dangers such as bursting blisters,\r\netc., line the casket with rubber for a distance of 3 inches above the\r\nbottom. For transportation of these cases, govern yourself according to\r\nthe provisions of the transportation laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF SPECIAL DISEASES.—Continued.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pericarditis.=—_Definition._—An acute inflammation of the pericardium\r\nand the serous covering of the heart.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Give the body a thorough injection of half strength fluid\r\nfollowed by normal fluid. Drain from the veins. Inject the abdominal\r\ncavity. For transportation of these cases, govern yourself according to\r\nthe provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hydropericardium.=—_Synonym._—Dropsy of the pericardium.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—Hydropericardium is a non-inflammatory condition of the\r\npericardium, attended by an accumulation of sero-albuminous fluid.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—Hydropericardium is not a disease of itself, but it is\r\nalways secondary. The accumulated fluid is usually clear, of an amber\r\ncolor, though it may become turbid by the presence of fibrin or red\r\nblood corpuscles. The fluid is alkaline in reaction.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—As this disease is always secondary to another, the\r\ntreatment will also be secondary and all that can be said is that the\r\nheart sac should be relieved of its accumulated serous fluid, after\r\nthe body has received the treatment necessary for the immediate cause\r\nof death. Transportation will also be covered by the disease causing\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hemopericardium.=—_Definition._—Hemopericardium is an infiltration\r\nof blood into the pericardium. It is the result of a rupture of an\r\naneurism of the aorta or coronary arteries, or in rare cases from\r\nrupture of the heart. It may also arise from injuries such as bullet\r\nwounds, fracture of the ribs, sternum, etc.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—This condition is usually secondary to another such as\r\ngun shot wound, aneurism of the aorta, etc., so that the treatment\r\nmust be given under the heading of the immediate cause of death. For\r\ntransportation requirements also refer to the immediate cause of death\r\nand the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pneumo-Pericardium.=—_Definition._—Pneumo-pericardium is an\r\naccumulation of air in the pericardium. Although this is a rare\r\ndisease, it does occasionally occur, either through diseased processes,\r\nsuch as cancerous or tubercular ulceration or through injuries; thus\r\na ruptured pulmonary cavity might result in this condition, or the\r\nperforation of the esophagus, by malignant processes would give rise to\r\nthis lesion. Sometimes pus in the pericardium will generate gas.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—As the accumulation of air or gas is secondary to some\r\nother process of disease, the immediate cause of death will carry with\r\nit the proper treatment. The gas itself should be removed by piercing\r\nthe pericardium with a small needle or trocar, after which a small\r\nquantity of fluid should be injected.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Endocarditis.=—_Definition._—Endocarditis is an inflammation of the\r\nlining membrane of the heart, and is generally confined to the valves,\r\nthough other parts may be affected.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The morbid changes are, first, a reddened and injected\r\nappearance of the endothelium, which soon becomes opaque and swollen\r\nfrom congestion of the small blood vessels. This swelling or thickening\r\nof the membrane furnishes a favorable resting place for deposits of\r\nfibrin, and we have small, beady deposits from the size of a pin point\r\nto that of a pea, or even larger. These small, beady excrescences may\r\nbecome detached, and floating off in the general current, give rise to\r\nembolism in distant parts.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—An embolism means the obstruction of a blood vessel\r\nby some foreign material. If in the injection of fluid, there is an\r\nobstruction in one of the blood vessels, leading to one of the organs,\r\nyou will never be any the wiser, but if the obstruction is in one of\r\nthe vessels supplying a certain area of skin, the condition will show\r\nup sooner or later, when that certain part will have to be treated\r\nhypodermically. Slow arterial injection with drainage of blood should\r\nbe given and when symptoms of fermentation are present, include special\r\nattention to the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aortic Incompetency.=—_Synonyms._—Aortic Insufficiency; Aortic\r\nRegurgitation.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—Inability of the aortic valves to properly close an\r\nabnormally large aortic opening, or a change in the segments whereby\r\nthey are shortened by curling of the leaflets, or by calcification.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Bodies dead of this disease will be found with very\r\nmuch blood, and the elimination of the blood by drainage should be\r\nthe first consideration along with the injection of fluid. The fluid\r\nshould be diluted one-half for the first part of the injection, and\r\nsufficient fluid used to reach all parts of the circulatory system.\r\nIt will be well to add fluid equal to the amount of blood and fluid\r\ntaken from the vein to your normal injection in a body the size of the\r\none to be operated on. A complete cavity injection should be given.\r\nFor transportation, govern yourself according to the provisions of the\r\ntransportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aortic Stenosis.=—_Definition._—Aortic stenosis is an obstruction of\r\nthe aortic orifice, due to changes in the segments of the semilunar\r\nvalves, or arterio-sclerosis, or atheromatous deposits.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Give same treatment advised for aortic incompetency, with\r\nspecial care in the injection. Sclerotic conditions may complicate\r\nthe injection, and in that case as many arteries should be injected as\r\npossible together with full blood drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mitral Incompetency.=—_Synonyms._—Mitral Regurgitation; Mitral\r\nInsufficiency.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—This condition is an incomplete or imperfect closure of\r\nthe auriculo-ventricular opening, permitting the regurgitation of blood\r\nduring the contraction of the left ventricle, and due to an abnormal\r\ncondition of the leaflets or an enlarged opening.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Give same treatment as advised for aortic incompetency,\r\nwith special care to remove as much blood as possible, which, with\r\nmassaging the face downward, should relieve any blood discolorations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mitral Stenosis.=—_Definition._—Mitral stenosis is a constriction\r\nof the left auriculo-ventricular orifice, usually due to valvular\r\nendocarditis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Give this body the same treatment as advised for aortic\r\nincompetency, with special care indicated in mitral incompetency.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tricuspid Incompetency.=—_Synonym._—Tricuspid Regurgitation.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—This condition is an imperfect closure of the tricuspid\r\nvalves, due to dilation of the right ventricle or to disease of the\r\nvalves.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Drain as much blood as possible from this case. Massage\r\nthe face downward, and inject the maximum amount of fluid; diluting\r\nthe first bottle to half strength. In obstinate cases of blood\r\ndiscoloration, open the common carotid arteries and internal jugular\r\nveins, inject upward in the arteries and drain from the veins, so as\r\nto wash out the vessels of the face. For facial injection use nothing\r\nstronger than half strength fluid. Give thorough cavity injection.\r\nFor transportation, govern yourself according to the provisions of the\r\ntransportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tricuspid Stenosis.=—_Definition._—Tricuspid stenosis is an\r\nobstruction of the tricuspid opening, usually congenital, though it may\r\nbe acquired.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Treat the same as for tricuspid incompetency.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pulmonary Incompetency.=—_Synonym._—Pulmonary Insufficiency.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—Pulmonary incompetency is an imperfect closure of\r\nthe pulmonary orifice of the right ventricle due to changes in the\r\npulmonary valves.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Treat the same as for tricuspid incompetency.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pulmonary Stenosis.=—_Definition._—Pulmonary stenosis is an\r\nobstruction of the pulmonary opening of the right ventricle, due to\r\ncongenital defects or to endocarditis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Treat the same as for tricuspid incompetency.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cardiac Thrombosis.=—_Definition._—Cardiac thrombosis is the formation\r\nof blood clots in the cavities of the heart.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The blood clots are found most frequently in the right\r\nside of the heart. They vary in size, from that of a pin head to that\r\nof a hen's egg. When degeneration takes place, softening follows, and\r\nsometimes particles become dislodged and float off to set up thrombi in\r\nother viscera.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Remove the maximum amount of blood by drainage along with\r\nthe injection of fluid. The fluid in this case should be not more than\r\nhalf strength for the first part of the injection, to be followed by\r\nenough normal fluid to secure preservation. If thrombi have lodged\r\nin any of the larger arteries, the circulation to the part reached\r\nby the branches of the artery will be affected. This can be overcome\r\nby injecting an artery close to the part which is not receiving the\r\nfluid. Massage the face downward to assist capillary circulation.\r\nGive a complete cavity injection. For transportation, govern yourself\r\naccording to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hypertrophy of the Heart.=—_Definition._—Hypertrophy of the heart is\r\nan enlargement of the organ, due to an increase in the volume of its\r\nmuscular fibers, and usually also to dilatation of its cavities.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Secure full drainage from the veins. Drainage will be\r\nstimulated by an injection of half strength fluid for the first part\r\nof the injection and a massage of the face. Follow the first part of\r\nthe injection with enough normal fluid to secure preservation. Give\r\na complete cavity injection. For transportation, govern yourself\r\naccording to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cardiac Dilatation.=—_Definition._—Cardiac dilatation is an increase\r\nin the size of the cavities of the heart, due either to thickening or\r\nthinning of the walls.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Treat the same as for hypertrophy of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cardiac Atrophy.=—_Definition._—Cardiac atrophy is a decrease in the\r\nsize, strength, weight, and activity of the heart.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Remove blood by drainage, and inject half strength fluid\r\nfor the first part of the injection. The amount of fluid need not be as\r\ngreat as in the acute disease of the heart. Massage the face downward.\r\nGive cavity injection. For transportation, govern yourself according to\r\nthe provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Arterio-Sclerosis.=—_Synonyms._—Endarteritis; Atheroma; Arterial\r\nSclerosis.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—Arterio-sclerosis is an inflammatory and degenerative\r\ncondition of the arterial system, primarily of the intima, although\r\nlater degenerative changes may involve the whole structure. Calcarine\r\ndeposits are quite common.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—As a result of proliferation, infiltrated areas begin\r\nin the middle and outer coats. These nodules vary in size from that\r\nof a small shot to that of a large coin. As they increase in size,\r\nthe intima loses its smoothness and becomes thickened and rough.\r\nAs these changes progress, the middle and outer coats are weakened.\r\nCalcification may also occur in the wall.\r\n\r\nIn the diffuse form the change in the coats of the vessels extends\r\nthroughout the greater part of the arterial system, and in some cases\r\ninvades the capillaries and veins.\r\n\r\nIn the senile arterio-sclerosis calcareous deposits occur, which render\r\nthe vessels rigid. Where these tissue-changes involve the capillaries,\r\nthere may be complete obliteration of their lumen in some places.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—In some cases the artery appears to be closed at a point\r\nahead of the tube and will resist the injection of fluid. Usually,\r\nhowever, the injection can be made without resistance. Blood should be\r\ndrained from these cases so as to allow as full capillary penetration\r\nas possible. When no arterial injection can be made, open the internal\r\njugular and several other large veins, drain blood from them and then\r\ninject fluid while the tube is within the vessel. If necessary add a\r\ncomplete hypodermic injection to all parts of the body excepting the\r\nface. Give the cavities full treatment. For transportation, govern\r\nyourself according to the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fatty Degeneration of the Arteries.=—In the fatty degeneration of\r\narteries the process consists in the gradual replacement of certain\r\nparts of the muscular cells by fat droplets. The fat makes its\r\nappearance as minute droplets or granules in the cells. These granules,\r\nwhich are characterized by their dark color, gradually increase\r\nin number and ultimately the whole of that part of the cell may be\r\ntransformed. During the process the granules coalesce, and in this\r\nmanner form distinct drops of fat. As the process proceeds the cell is\r\nincreased in size and becomes more globular in shape. The cell wall is\r\ndestroyed and the cell may thus be converted into a mass of granular\r\nfat. Ultimately the matter between the granules of fat liquify. The\r\ncorpuscles break up and the fat becomes distributed in the surrounding\r\ntissues. The immediate effect of this fatty degeneration is to produce\r\nmore or less softening of the fatty part, which will impair or destroy\r\nits function. In the case of the artery, the internal, middle and\r\nexternal coats may be affected, but the external is the one usually\r\nfirst attacked. The inner layer or endothelium, and the connective\r\ntissue cells in the deeper layers of the inner coat may become affected\r\nin various parts of the vessel. The process may involve a great\r\nportion of the inner coat, even the whole thickness of the intima may\r\nbe destroyed. The walls of the artery may be entirely solidified, the\r\ncanal being closed completely with a soft, yellowish substance as a\r\nresult of the disease. The artery might appear to be a solid mass when\r\nthe dissecting knife is passed through. We have seen the anterior and\r\nposterior tibial, the popliteal, radial, ulnar, the aorta arteries, and\r\nespecially the arch of the aorta thus affected. Calcification may be\r\npresent at many places. These cases are frequently met with in old age.\r\n\r\nA body of this kind, where there is fatty degeneration of the arteries,\r\nis sometimes hard to embalm. The walls of the artery will be very\r\nmuch weakened, and too much pressure must not be made on them while\r\ninjecting fluid. Inject the fluid so that it will take several hours\r\nto fill the tissues. The pressure should be gentle and regular when\r\nthe aspirator and injector pump is used. If this precaution is taken\r\noften the whole body can be embalmed without a rupture of the arterial\r\nsystem, the fluid reaching all the extremities by means of collateral\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nIf the embalmer should be so unfortunate as to rupture the circulation\r\nthen he will have to resort to cavity embalming, and the subcutaneous\r\ntissues will have to be embalmed by the hollow needle trocar.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Aneurism.=—_Definition._—An aneurism is a circumscribed dilatation\r\nof an artery, formed by the giving away of one or more of its coats. A\r\nfalse aneurism is where there is a rupture of the coats, and the blood\r\nis found in the adjacent tissues.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Drain blood from a large vein. Inject half strength\r\nfluid for the first part of the injection, followed by enough normal\r\nfluid to secure preservation. The aneurism itself, will not affect the\r\ncirculation of fluid to any great extent. Massage the face downward.\r\nGive a complete cavity injection. For transportation, govern yourself\r\naccording to the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF SPECIAL DISEASES.—Continued.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Jaundice.=—_Synonym._—Icterus.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—Jaundice is a symptom rather than a disease, and is\r\nfound in the various affections of the liver. It is characterized by a\r\ndeposit of bilirubin in the various structures and fluids of the body,\r\nwhich gives them a yellow or jaundiced hue.\r\n\r\n_Etiology._—Most pathologists agree that all the forms of jaundice can\r\nonly come from obstruction. The obstruction is due to inflammation\r\ntumefaction of the duodenum or bile-ducts; to foreign bodies, such\r\nas gall stones or parasites, within the ducts; tumors within the duct\r\nor by pressure from without, such as tumors, gravid uterus, or fecal\r\nmatter; or to stricture or obliteration of the duct.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Catarrhal Jaundice.=—_Definition._—Catarrhal inflammation of the\r\nlining membrane of the biliary ducts, and the duodenum, and attended\r\nwith discoloration of the skin and tissues from the consequent\r\nretention and absorption of the bile.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—That portion of the duct lying in the intestines is more\r\nfrequently and seriously affected, though the inflammation may extend\r\nto the cystic and even the hepatic duct. The membrane lining the ducts\r\nis swollen and inflamed. The liver is usually congested, slightly\r\nenlarged, and of a deep yellow color. The gall bladder is usually\r\ndistended with bile. The ducts are occluded by the swollen mucosa and\r\nplugs of inspissated mucous.\r\n\r\nDiscoloration of the skin and conjunctiva occurs. The yellow tinge\r\nbegins in the eyes, forehead, and neck, gradually extending over\r\nthe body, the color being the deepest in the wrinkles and folds of\r\nthe skin. The color is generally of a lemon hue, becoming darker and\r\nassuming a bronze or greenish tint as the hepatic lesion assumes a\r\ngraver character.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Infantile Jaundice.=—_Etiology._—It is not known positively what\r\ncauses give rise to temporary jaundice in the new-born. Some say it\r\nis due to a reduction of blood pressure in the hepatic capillaries,\r\nwhile others say it is due to a stasis in the smaller bile ducts,\r\nwhich are compressed by the distended radicles of the portal vein. The\r\nsevere form may be due to congenital closure or absence of the common\r\nor hepatic duct, to hepatic syphilis of congenital form, or to septic\r\ninfection due to phlebitis of the umbilical vein.\r\n\r\nIn the child the skin becomes a yellowish hue of various shades. In the\r\nsevere form the hue increases in intensity, the skin assuming a bronze\r\nor yellowish-green color. The abdomen becomes full and tumid, owing to\r\nthe congestion of the liver and spleen. When due to syphilis, there is\r\nusually skin eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Malignant Jaundice.=—_Synonyms._—Acute Yellow Atrophy of the Liver.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A grave form of jaundice characterized by neurosis of the\r\nhepatic cells and atrophy of the liver.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The liver shows marked atrophy, being not more than\r\ntwo-thirds or one-half of the normal size, is thin, flabby. On making a\r\nsection a yellow or a reddish yellow surface is presented. The hepatic\r\ncells are found in every stage of necrosis. Most of the organs are bile\r\nstained, as well as the skin, and hemorrhages are frequent.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for Jaundice._—Since the conditions are similar and since\r\nthe conditions after death are identical in reference to pigmentation,\r\nwe will consider the treatment of infantile, malignant, and catarrhal\r\njaundice under one head.\r\n\r\nThe pigmentation of the skin, no matter how small, is the condition\r\nwhich presents itself most forcefully, and is the most annoying to the\r\nembalmer. Much study has been given to the subject, but with little\r\nsuccess. It is claimed by some that certain fluids will bleach and\r\nbring out the natural color.\r\n\r\nA small amount of bile is sufficient to tint the surface of the body.\r\nBile is composed of salts, fats, organic matter, acids, and also\r\ncoloring matter, called the bile pigments. Bilirubin is the principal\r\ncoloring matter, and when dissolved in alkali, forms, when coming in\r\ncontact with the air and also in the dead body, a green precipitate\r\nknown as biliverdin. The bile pigments in the blood are carried with\r\nthe serum from the capillaries to the tissues, being deposited in the\r\ninternal coat or deep layer of the epidermis as well as the papillary\r\nof the dermis. The amount deposited regulates the extent of the\r\npigmentation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beneficial things to do, where pigmentation is present\r\nis to wash out the arterial system, draw blood from the veins, massage\r\nthe exposed parts. Inject a diluted fluid at first, follow with a fluid\r\nof full strength, until complete disinfection and permeation of the\r\ntissues has taken place. Keep up constant massaging during the whole\r\ncourse of injection. This may bring fair results, with the addition of\r\nface tints and showing the body under artificial light.\r\n\r\nStrong solutions of formaldehyde when used at first are deleterious,\r\ncausing the skin to become green. This greenness is more pronounced\r\nwhen chemicals such as methylene blue have been administered by the\r\nattending physician before death. Bilirubin is a red yellow color, and\r\nalkalies precipitate the bilirubin and form biliverdin. Biliverdin is\r\na greenish color.\r\n\r\nAll fluids contain alkalies, and are mostly alkali in reaction, and\r\nthis may account for the greenish color of the skin after the injection\r\nof fluid. Acids do not precipitate the biliverdin and there is a\r\ntendency to dissolve it and keep it in solution.\r\n\r\nMoadinger suggests that a weak solution of some acid be injected into\r\nthe arterial system before the injection of embalming fluid. He prefers\r\na two per cent. solution of oxalic acid.\r\n\r\nDhonau prefers the use of a one or two per cent. solution of borax, to\r\nbe injected into the arterial system, followed by half strength fluid,\r\nand this followed by full strength fluid. Dhonau also applies full\r\nstrength peroxide of hydrogen to the skin while massaging the face.\r\n\r\nEckels prefers the use of a fluid containing a peroxide.\r\n\r\nIf methylene blue has been administered by the attending physician and\r\nyou have learned this fact before hand, it is then not advisable to\r\nuse a formaldehyde fluid. There is a chemical action set up between\r\nthe methylene blue and the formaldehyde which will give to the tissues\r\na greenish color which is quite objectionable. In this case you would\r\ninject some fluid which does not contain formaldehyde. A benzoate of\r\nsoda or borax, or peroxide solution would do.\r\n\r\nA good formula to use, when you know methylene blue has been used by\r\nthe attending physician is:\r\n\r\n  Rx  Carbolic acid     5 oz.\r\n      Borax            12 oz.\r\n      Glycerine         1 oz.\r\n      Water, qs.        1 gal.\r\n\r\nFor transportation, govern yourself according to the transportation\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cirrhosis of the Liver.=—_Synonyms._—Interstitial Hepatitis; Sclerosis\r\nof the Liver; Nutmeg Liver; Hobnailed Liver.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A chronic disease of the liver, characterized by an\r\nincreased connective tissue, a reduction in the size of the organ, and\r\na degeneration of the parenchymatous constituents.\r\n\r\n_Etiology._—In a great majority of cases the disease is due to alcohol,\r\nsyphilis, highly spiced and very rich foods. Cirrhosis may result\r\nfrom chronic obstruction of the bile ducts, due to gall stones, or\r\ntuberculosis. Cirrhosis frequently occurs between the ages of thirty\r\nand sixty years, though it may be found in the extremes of life. Men\r\nare more liable to contract the disease, owing to greater dissipations.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The liver is increased in size by the increase of\r\nconnective tissue, and hyperaemic. On the surface it exhibits a knobbed\r\nappearance (hobnailed liver) and these knobs present through the\r\ncapsule a yellowish appearance. The granulations vary in size from a\r\npinhead to a pea. As a rule there is a little jaundice, as there is\r\na decrease in the production of bile, instead the skin takes on an\r\nearthy, sallow tint. There is generally ascites, swelling of the feet\r\nand legs, which increases until the abdomen and the lower extremities\r\nbecome of an enormous size. The nutrition of the body suffers, the\r\nskin is dry and harsh. The blood is altered in quantity, and coagulates\r\nquickly. Ecchymotic spots appear on the skin, about the face and nose.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—There are probably not many other cases of death, which\r\nneed greater skill and intelligence in their treatment than does\r\ncirrhosis. The condition that presents itself is a distended abdomen\r\nwith gas and liquid. The limbs are also distended and the upper part of\r\nthe body is wasted away and is greatly discolored as death was caused\r\nby asphyxia.\r\n\r\nPlace the body on the board, open the femoral vein, and insert your\r\ndrainage tube. It is better to use this vein as it is larger, and there\r\nis more control of the removal of blood, and we would advise in this\r\ncase the use of the flexible rubber drainage tube, which can be pushed\r\nup in the vein till it reaches the right auricle of the heart if you\r\nwish. Drain all the blood possible. Use the trocar method, see page\r\n255, or the direct incision, see page 257, to remove the gases and\r\nascitic fluid from the abdomen. Use the bandage method, see page 339 to\r\nremove the water from the tissue of the extremities.\r\n\r\nRaise the femoral artery and inject slowly a diluted fluid and massage\r\nthe face gently toward the jugular vein, using some recognized face\r\nbleacher. Then follow with an injection of fluid of full strength until\r\nyou are sure the fluid has permeated every tissue of the body. Do not\r\nbe afraid to use plenty of fluid. Inject the cavities.\r\n\r\nFor transportation, govern yourself according to the transportation\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carcinoma of the Liver.=—_Definition._—A cancerous growth in the liver.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—Jaundice is present in most cases and where the portal\r\ncirculation is seriously compressed, ascites developes. The liver is\r\ngreatly enlarged, and the surface is nodular.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—As in all chronic affections of the liver, where the skin\r\ntakes on a yellowish or bronze hue, due to pigmentation, it is almost\r\nimpossible to bring about the desired cosmetic effects. The pigment is\r\nnot only in the blood vessel but also in the tissues of the skin.\r\n\r\nWe would advise the washing out of the tissues, by the use of the\r\noxalic or borax solution, injecting the axillary artery and draining\r\nfrom the femoral artery or raising both the carotid arteries, injecting\r\nupward on one side and draining from the other.\r\n\r\nFor transportation, govern yourself according to the transportation\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Appendicitis.=—An inflammation, acute or chronic, of the appendix.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The pathology will depend to a great extent upon the\r\ndegree of the inflammation. Ulceration may take place or there may be\r\nperforation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—If, after an operation, reopen the incision made by\r\nthe surgeon, relieve the gas pressure on the intestines by incising\r\nthem; surround the intestines with hardening compound; then inject an\r\nartery, using half strength fluid for the first 64 oz., followed by\r\nenough normal fluid to secure preservation. Drain the blood during the\r\ninjection by one of the drainage processes.\r\n\r\nIf no operation has been made, insert a trocar into the caecum to\r\nrelieve the gas pressure, then inject normal fluid into the same place,\r\nusing sufficient fluid to neutralize the process of putrefactive\r\nfermentation. The trocar can be first inserted in the usual place\r\npassing it to the caecum, or through the abdominal wall directly over\r\nthe caecum. The arterial injection and drainage should be made as is\r\nmentioned above. For transportation, govern yourself according to the\r\ntransportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Peritonitis.=—An acute or chronic inflammation of the peritoneum\r\neither local or general.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—There is nearly always present more or less fluid in the\r\nabdominal cavity.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Drain blood from a large vein, and inject half strength\r\nfluid for the first part of the injection, following this with enough\r\nnormal fluid to preserve the tissues of the body. After the arterial\r\ninjection and drainage have been completed, pierce the abdominal cavity\r\nin the usual place and draw off all the fluid that you can reach,\r\npaying especial attention to the lower part of the cavity. Then inject\r\nnormal or supernormal fluid into the cavity to neutralize the process\r\nof putrefactive fermentation. Pierce the colons and inject fluid into\r\nthem as well. If fermentation resists this treatment, make a small\r\nincision along the median line and above the umbilicus, examine the\r\nstomach and intestines, incising them if they contain the gas. After\r\neliminating the gas, inject fluid directly into them, or, surround the\r\norgans of the cavity with good hardening compound; sew up the incision\r\nand the body should not deteriorate in any way. For transportation,\r\ngovern yourself according to the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dropsy.=—_Definition._—Dropsy is the accumulation of serous fluid in\r\na cavity or in the tissues.\r\n\r\nDropsy of the abdomen is called ascites.\r\n\r\nDropsy of the chest is called hydrothorax.\r\n\r\nDropsy of the peritoneum is called hydroperitoneum or ascites. General\r\ndropsy of the cellular tissues is called anasarca.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ascites.=—_Synonyms._—Dropsy of the Peritoneum; Abdominal Dropsy.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—An accumulation of serous fluid in the peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\n_Etiology._—Any obstruction of the portal circulation is a possible\r\ncause of ascites, the most frequent being cirrhosis of the liver.\r\nPressure from tumors or neighboring organs may also give rise to it.\r\nPeritonitis and valvular diseases of the heart are also responsible\r\nfor ascites, and chronic pulmonary affections may impair the portal\r\ncirculation to the extent of producing it.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The quality and character of the fluid show great\r\nvariation, from a few pints to several gallons, and from a straw or\r\nlemon tint to a brownish or greenish hue. It may be blood stained, and\r\noccasionally clean and transparent. It is usually watery in character.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Use the trocar method. Insert the trocar through the\r\numbilicus and draw off all the ascitic fluid from the abdomen, then\r\nsurround the organs with a quantity of fluid sufficient to preserve\r\nthem. Or if you desire, use the direct incision and after the ascitic\r\nfluid has been drawn off, surround the organs with a hardening\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\nThe body in general should be preserved through an arterial injection\r\nof normal fluid for the first 64 ounces, then one and one-quarter\r\nstrength for all subsequent bottles. This, if attended by copious\r\ndrainage from a large vein, will preserve all portions of the body\r\nexcepting possibly the epidermis of the posterior abdominal wall,\r\nwhich, by gravitation of the ascitic fluid, will become separated from\r\nthe derma, producing skin slip, and causing the formation of blisters.\r\n\r\nPreviously to placing the body on the embalming board for treatment,\r\na rubber cover should be placed over the board so that drippings of\r\nall kinds can be made to flow into a bucket at the lower end of the\r\nembalming board. When the above mentioned blisters are cut and their\r\ncontents disposed of by gravitation into the bucket, a strong solution\r\nof formaldehyde should be applied to the affected skin to harden it and\r\nto prevent any further progress toward decomposition.\r\n\r\nIn ascitic cases the casket should be lined with rubber or oil cloth\r\nto a point three or four inches above the bottom. In addition to this\r\nprecaution, the use of sawdust is favored so that any unlooked for\r\nbreaking of blisters may not be attended by a flow of the ascitic\r\nliquid from the casket. Many embalmers do not protect themselves\r\nagainst contingencies of this kind and are frequently criticized by the\r\nfriends and family of the deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Anasarca.=—_Definition._—Anasarca is a general dropsy of the cellular\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—_Bandage Method._—Bandage the extremities of the body,\r\ncommencing at the toes and finger tips, bandaging upward to the hip and\r\nshoulder, using a rubber bandage. Relieve the water as you go along,\r\nthen rebandage, and by the third application you will have removed most\r\nof the water from the extremities. Do not leave the bandage on while\r\ninjecting.\r\n\r\n_Bandage Method._—Bandage the lower limbs, commencing with the thighs.\r\nBandage as tight as possible down to the toes and make an incision in\r\nthe heel, from which drainage of the serous fluid can be secured. In\r\nthis method no laps are left between the bandaging so that the serous\r\nfluid can be forced toward the opening at the heel. (This method is\r\nsaid to be reliable, although we have had but little experience with\r\nit.)\r\n\r\nAny accumulation of ascitic fluid in the cavities should be removed by\r\naspiration with the trocar, as described in the treatment of ascites\r\nand hydrothorax. The rubber cover for the embalming board as described\r\nin the treatment for ascites, should not be omitted.\r\n\r\nAfter the water has been eliminated as far as possible, the arterial\r\ninjection should be made, using 64 ounces of normal strength fluid,\r\nfollowed by enough one-fourth strength fluid to secure preservation.\r\nCopious drainage will help to clear the blood vessels and allow a\r\nbetter distribution of the fluid, thereby assuring good preservation of\r\nall parts excepting the epidermis, which is practically closed off to\r\nthe fluid by the accumulation of water in the subcutaneous tissue.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the skin should receive a good application of strong\r\nformaldehyde fluid before and after the principle operation, so as to\r\nstrengthen it against the putrefactive tendencies of the rete mucosum.\r\n\r\nThese cases should be watched closely between the time of embalming and\r\nthe funeral, as the most thorough preparation is sometimes unequal to\r\nthe task of preserving the entire body in such a way as to prevent the\r\nformation of blisters.\r\n\r\nFor transportation of all dropsical conditions, govern yourself\r\naccording to the provisions of the transportation rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF ACCIDENT CASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this head are treated those deaths which are the result of\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Specific Treatment of Accidents.=—_Broken Neck_, _Hanging_,\r\n_Strangulation._—The mode of death may possibly cause a separation\r\nor dividing of the blood vessels of the neck. If this is the case\r\nthere will remain in the head and face a large amount of blood, which\r\nwould soon become coagulated, causing a dark bluish turning black\r\ndiscoloration. The treatment then must be to get this blood from the\r\nface, so would recommend the common carotid for injection of fluid and\r\nthe internal jugular vein for the removal of blood.\r\n\r\nRaise both the artery and the vein to the surface, and insert the\r\narterial tube in the artery toward the face, and inject a small\r\nquantity of fluid in order to cause a pressure on the venous system,\r\nthen open the vein, insert the drainage tube and begin to remove the\r\nblood, and as the blood drains from the drainage tube inject slowly\r\ninto the artery. This will help to push the blood out of the capillary\r\nsystem and into the blood bottle and thus clear up the face of its\r\ndiscoloration.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the raising of only one common carotid would hardly\r\nsuffice, and it would be far better to operate on both carotids to get\r\nthe best results. For this reason then the circular incision would\r\nbe the best operation, and perhaps the use of the Y shaped drainage\r\ntube. With the Y shaped drainage tube both sides of the face could be\r\ninjected at the same time, and the blood could be removed from both\r\ninternal jugular veins, and the operator could not help but get good\r\nresults. The removal of blood from the internal jugulars in this direct\r\nway will relieve the pressure in the capillaries and smaller veins and\r\ninduce a better circulation to all the immediate tissues.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Body Severed.=—For these cases one should have a very good idea of the\r\ngeneral arterial and venous circulations of the body, for many of the\r\nsmaller as well as the larger vessels will be cut, necessitating one to\r\ntie them off.\r\n\r\nIf the body is severed below the diaphragm remove and cleanse all the\r\nloose and injured organs and tissues, place them in a bucket or pan\r\nand cover with fluid. Ligate all the injured arteries and veins in the\r\nupper and lower parts.\r\n\r\nInject the lower extremities from inside the abdominal cavity using the\r\ncommon iliac artery, observing the presence of the remaining united\r\narteries and veins, which you can now see, for fluid will leak from\r\nthem. The lock forceps will enable you to pick them up and with the\r\naneurism needle dissect around the end of the vessel and tie each one\r\ntight.\r\n\r\nTreat the upper extremity in the same way injecting either from the\r\ninside or the outside, according as the severity of the accident may\r\nlead you to decide. Inject from the inside upward through the aorta,\r\nor from the outside either through the radial, brachial, axillary or\r\ncarotid.\r\n\r\nThe trunk may now be sewed together, beginning at the middle of the\r\nback. Sew each side up leaving the top open to receive the organs and\r\nthe tissues which were removed. After these are placed more or less in\r\nposition sprinkle hardening compound throughout the cavity. Now sew up\r\nthe front and then place a strong bandage around the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Arm Severed.=—Clean off the parts, and inject the severed\r\npart through the radial towards the hand and by means of collateral\r\ncirculation through palmar arch, the upper part will be embalmed and\r\nthe arteries that have been severed disclosed, when they can be tied\r\noff. If there is a great leakage through the stub end, and all the\r\narteries can not be tied off, plaster of paris may be put on the stub\r\nand then a strong and tight bandage drawn around.\r\n\r\nThe remaining body can then be injected through the opposite carotid,\r\nbrachial or femoral, and when the leakages begin to occur at the stub\r\nend of the arm they can be found and tied off or if the leakage is too\r\ngreat plaster of paris may be used and a tight bandage placed about the\r\nstub end.\r\n\r\nAfter both the arm and the body have been injected the arm can now be\r\nsewed on in its natural position, plaster of paris put around and a\r\nstrong bandage placed around or a splint may be used on both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Leg Severed.=—Clean off the parts, and inject the severed part\r\nthrough the large dorsal toward the foot and by means of collateral\r\ncirculation through the plantar arch, the upper part will be embalmed\r\nand the arteries that have been severed disclosed, when they can be\r\ntied off. If there is a great leakage through the stub end, and all the\r\narteries can not be tied off, plaster of paris may be put on the stub\r\nand then a strong and tight bandage drawn around.\r\n\r\nThe remaining body can then be injected through the carotid, brachial,\r\naxillary, or the opposite femoral and when the leakages begin at the\r\nstub end of the leg they can be found and tied off, or if the leakage\r\nis too great plaster of paris may be used and a tight bandage placed\r\nabout the stub end.\r\n\r\nAfter both the leg and the body have been injected, the leg can be\r\nsewed on in its natural position, plaster of paris put around and a\r\nstrong bandage placed around, or a splint may be used on both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Head Severed.=—Clean off the parts, and inject the head through\r\nthe stub end of the carotid artery, and by means of collateral\r\ncirculation through the circle of Willis, the fluid will leak through\r\nthe other severed vessels and disclose them, so that they can be tied\r\noff. If one side of the face should take more fluid than the other side\r\nby this method the other carotid can be injected so as to equalize. It\r\nwould perhaps be impossible to tie off all the tiny vessels that are\r\nsevered so plaster of paris may be used to cover the stub end.\r\n\r\nTo inject the body, the four principle arteries to be tied are the\r\ntwo common carotids and the two vertebrals, besides numerous veins\r\nand small vessels. If it is impossible to tie all the severed vessels\r\nplaster of paris may be used, and then by injecting either through the\r\nbrachial, axillary or femoral a thorough injection may be obtained. The\r\nstub end of the carotid might also be used for injection, but would\r\nnot advise it as in most cases we find that it would be hard to get\r\nespecially if the head were cut off close to the shoulders.\r\n\r\nWhen both the head and the body have been injected, bring the two\r\nparts together by using a splint in the vertebral column, and having\r\nplastered well together sew the skin. Demi-surgery can be practiced to\r\nthe fullest extent in this case, with great cosmetic effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Head Crushed.=—Remove all the coagulated blood and the injured\r\nparts of the brain. Cleanse the cavity thoroughly and remould with\r\nplaster of paris. Inject the best you can through one or both of the\r\ncarotid arteries, and complete the injection hypodermically. Inject\r\nthe rest of the body in the regular way, through one of the carotids\r\nraised for the injection of the head. With the practice and use\r\nof demi-surgery, all the bruised and torn fragments may be blended\r\ntogether, and the cosmetic effect made almost perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Foot Crushed.=—Remove all the coagulated blood by washing, and\r\nplace all the parts together as nearly natural as possible. Now inject\r\nany of the principle arteries used in embalming, watching carefully the\r\nflow of fluid and blood. As soon as you see a leakage stop injecting\r\nlong enough to tie it up, and when all the visible leakages have\r\nbeen thus treated, wrap the whole of the injured part with a bandage\r\nsaturated with a plaster of paris solution. After this becomes dry and\r\nset complete the injection.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Chest Crushed.=—Open up the cavity and remove all the injured\r\norgans and tissues, which you will place in a vessel containing\r\nformaldehyde fluid. With a soft sponge remove all the coagulated blood\r\nfrom the cavity. Now tie up all the visible arteries and start the\r\ninjection from the inside, using first the innominate to inject the\r\nright arm and the right side of the face then the left common carotid\r\nto inject the left side of the face and the left subclavian to inject\r\nthe left arm. It must be remembered though that while one artery\r\nis being injected the others should be tied off lest by collateral\r\ncirculation you would get leakages. The thoracic aorta might be used\r\nbut it will be found more difficult because of the leakages which\r\nwould occur through the intercostal arteries. These leakages would not\r\noccur nearly as much by the raising of the branches off the arch of\r\nthe aorta, namely the innominate, the left common carotid and the left\r\nsubclavian. Any leakage can be stopped by means of the lock forceps and\r\nthen tied.\r\n\r\nThe lower part of the body, if it is not injured, can be injected now\r\nthrough the abdominal aorta, but if there has been any damage done\r\nbelow the diaphragm, it would probably be best to further open up the\r\ncavity and inject each lower extremity through the common iliacs.\r\n\r\nNow replace all the organs and surround them with hardening compound,\r\nand sew up the cavity incisions, with great care and neatness. It would\r\nbe well to practice demi-surgery here, so that you would become more\r\nproficient in the art, and thus be able to do more efficient work on\r\nthe exposed parts, should the occasion ever demand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gun-shot in the Abdomen.=—When death occurs it is generally due to\r\nsevering or dividing of an artery or decomposition resulting from the\r\ninjury done the intestines. The operator should open the body cavity,\r\nfrom the end of the sternum bone to the pubic bone, and cleanse the\r\ncavity of all the coagulated blood and other putrid matter. Locate and\r\ntie up the injured vessels. The injection can then be started from one\r\nof the principle arteries which will aid in locating the other injured\r\nvessels. Puncture the stomach and inject inside, so as to prevent the\r\nformation of gas, and after the body has been injected place hardening\r\ncompound inside the body cavity and sew up carefully and neatly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Burns and Scalds.=—A burn is an injury to the body produced by\r\nthe application of a flame or of a substance heated above a certain\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nA scald is an injury produced by the application of a liquid heated\r\nabove a certain temperature.\r\n\r\nInjuries resulting from corrosive liquids such as sulphuric acid,\r\nnitric acid, caustic potash, carbolic acid, etc., are properly termed\r\nburns. A heated solid such as iron may produce a burn of great\r\nintensity from the blistering of the skin to the charring of the\r\nunderlying tissues. Metals heated above 212 degrees Fahrenheit will\r\nproduce redness, vesication and coagulation of the blood. Molten metals\r\ncause burns or scalds very similar to those produced by heated solids.\r\nBoiling oil produces severe burns. If a part is severely scalded with\r\nboiling water, the skin may appear sodden, blistered, and of an ash\r\ngrey color, but never produces blackening or charring of the cuticle.\r\nPhosphorous burns are usually very severe and of great depth, while\r\nthe area of skin destroyed is usually small. Gunpowder burns caused by\r\nexplosions are often of great superficial extent, extensive scorching\r\nand numerous carbon particles are commonly found imbedded in the true\r\nskin. Petroleum burns are generally severe, as usually all or nearly\r\nall the body is scorched and blackened. Burns from flame, extensive\r\nscorching with burnt hair is a usual feature in a flame burn. Burns\r\nfrom explosions of fire damp in coal mines are frequently of great\r\nextent and present the appearance of great scorching, and very often a\r\nquantity of coal dust will be found imbedded in the true skin. There\r\nare six degrees of burns as follows: (a) Simple hyperemia of the\r\nskin, (b) dermatitis, with vesicles or bullae, (c) necrosis of the\r\nsuperficial layer of the skin, (d) complete necrosis of the skin, (e)\r\nnecrosis of the skin, superficial fascia and muscles, and (f) complete\r\ncarbonization of the part.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The embalmer does not treat these cases according to the\r\ncause as much as to what is left of the part after burning has been\r\naccomplished. After observing the part to note whether the condition\r\ncan be bettered by a replacement of tissue by artificial means and\r\nfinding such to be the case, I would use a form of paste commonly used\r\nfor filling in cuts and restoring the features and with this paste\r\nthoroughly cover the burned part. If the affected part covers the\r\nentire face or most of it, an entire new surface will have to be built\r\nup with the paste. If the burning of the skin has left particles of\r\nepidermis adhering to the derma, I would use sweet oil and bath the\r\nentire face with it, thus softening the skin and allowing the removal\r\nof the small particles. Any small desiccated spots should be covered\r\nwith the paste. After carefully blending the paste with the skin so\r\nas to produce a smooth even complexion, which can best be done by the\r\nuse of a brush to smooth it with, apply a good quality of face powder\r\n(flesh color) to the part. If the color is too striking, or too white,\r\ndestroy the contrast with carmine rouge. This form of operation is\r\ncommonly known as demi-surgery. We find that the face powder is best\r\napplied with a pad made of surgical gauze especially when applied\r\nwith a patting movement. This gives a good imitation of the pores of\r\nthe skin, and if any further smoothing is necessary the brush can be\r\nused again. The principal result wanted is a good imitation of the\r\nnatural parts. If the operator will use the utmost care to give the\r\nparts gentle, fine touches here and there, a most artistic effect will\r\nbe produced. If the eye brows have been destroyed, imitate them with\r\ncharcoal, carbon, or dark theatrical paint. A good make-up outfit is\r\nindispensable for an embalmer handling many railroad cases during the\r\nyear, and as such can be had at any dealer in theatrical supplies, we\r\nadvise the securing of a few varieties of pastes, and some good face\r\npowder together with carmine rouge.\r\n\r\nIf the face is damp or moist, the theatrical paste above mentioned will\r\nnot adhere properly, and in that case alcohol applied to the skin will\r\ncause it to dry. One of the most important considerations in these\r\ncases, is the placing of the body in the casket. The body should be\r\nplaced as low as possible, the silk slide should be closed and a view\r\nof the body only secured through it, the light in the room should be\r\ntempered so that no striking rays of light serve to distort any portion\r\nof the features. Wonderful work has been accomplished by the authors\r\nand by others in rescuing cases of this kind from non-presentability\r\nto presentability, but in all cases, the ingenuity of the operator\r\nis taxed to the utmost, and the case never looks just right until the\r\nlast touch is applied. With the above information, you have only the\r\nrudiments of the work. Your success or failure will depend upon how\r\nhard you try to make good in each individual case, and your success in\r\nmatching colors, which can only be acquired with much patience.\r\n\r\nGive burned bodies a very thorough arterial injection, using half\r\nstrength fluid for the first part of the injection. The cavities\r\nshould also receive a good injection of normal fluid. The peculiar\r\nodor present about a burned body can be lessened by the use of false\r\ndeodorizers such as flowers, perfume, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF POSTED CASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cranial Evisceration.=—By this term is meant the complete removal of\r\nthe brain. To do so the scalp is cut from ear to ear, the front part\r\nis pulled forward over the nose and the back part over the occipital\r\nbone. A skull clamp is placed in position and with a saw take away the\r\ncalvarium. When the calvarium or skull cap has been removed the brain\r\nis in full view and can be easily removed by cutting the arteries at\r\nthe circle of Willis and the ligaments at the base of the skull.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Thoracic Autopsy.=—By this term is meant the complete removal of all\r\nthe organs of the thoracic or chest cavity. To do so the skin is cut on\r\neither side from the sterno-clavicular junction to a point where the\r\nninth rib joins to its costal cartilage. The ribs are cut on either\r\nside at the costochondral articulation, which will permit the entire\r\nfront chest wall to be taken away. The heart and lungs are now in full\r\nview and can be easily removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Abdominal Post.=—By this term is meant the complete removal of all\r\nthe organs of the abdominal cavity. To do so the skin and muscles\r\nare cut on either side from a point where the ninth rib joins its\r\ncostal cartilage vertically downward to about an inch above Poupart's\r\nligament and from there to the top of the pubic bone. When the anterior\r\nabdominal wall has been removed all the organs will be in full view and\r\ncan easily be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Posted Cases.=—By this term is meant those cases on which an autopsy\r\nhas been held and all the internal organs of the body have been\r\nremoved. Here all the internal circulation has been destroyed.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Place the body on the cooling board and undo all the\r\nstitches made by the physician in sewing up the body after the\r\npost-mortem. Remove all the organs, that have been previously removed\r\nby the physician, and place same in a bucket or other container. Clean\r\nout thoroughly all the blood from the cranial, thoracic and abdominal\r\ncavities. Now try to tie off the arteries in the cranial cavity which\r\nwill be the vertebrals or the basilar and the common carotids. If these\r\nhave been cut too short to be tied, then mix up some plaster of paris\r\nand cover them securely so that there will be no leakage. While the\r\nplaster of paris is setting raise the common iliac artery, which you\r\nwill find at the back of the abdomen just over the ilio-psoas muscle,\r\nrepresented by a line drawn from the body of the fourth dorsal vertebra\r\nto the center of Poupart's ligament. Inject the right and left common\r\niliac arteries downward which will take care of the lower extremities.\r\nHere the only artery you need to tie off is the deep epigastric artery\r\nwhich is a branch of the external iliac just a short distance above\r\nPoupart's ligament and which takes a course upward over the abdominal\r\nmuscles finally to anastomose with the deep mammary artery.\r\n\r\nBy the time you have injected the lower extremities, the plaster of\r\nparis will be set. Work from the inside of the thoracic cavity, and\r\ntie off the innominate, left common carotid and the left subclavian\r\narteries, and when this has been accomplished inject each one\r\nseparately. Here the only leakage you will have will be through the\r\nmammary or intercostal arteries which you will tie off as the leakage\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nNow turn the body over and hypodermic the back, then turn body over\r\nagain. Fill the cranial cavity with sawdust, place the skull cap in\r\nposition and sew up the scalp. Wash all the organs and place them back\r\nin the cavities in their proper positions or as nearly so as possible\r\nand as you do so fill in with hardening compound. Sew up the abdomen\r\nand wash the body with a disinfecting solution and apply outward\r\ncosmetics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF MISCELLANEOUS CASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Alcoholism.=—_Definition._—An intoxication, acute or chronic, due to\r\nthe injection of a sufficient quantity of alcohol to produce muscular\r\ninco-ordination, mental disturbances, and finally narcosis.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—Where death is the result of acute alcoholism, the mucous\r\nmembrane of the gastro-intestinal canal is engorged, injected, and\r\ndark red in color, and covered with a sticky, mucoid exudate. The\r\nbrain and the kidneys show the same characteristic changes. In chronic\r\nalcoholism, changes of a more permanent character take place, depending\r\nsomewhat upon the quantity, quality and kind of alcoholics consumed,\r\nand the length of time used. While all the bodily tissues are more or\r\nless impaired, the brain, kidneys, and digestive system suffer most.\r\nThere may be connective tissue changes, fatty degeneration, sclerosed\r\nkidneys, liver or arteries, and a more or less dilatation of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—In acute alcoholism, the blood should be drained from\r\na large vein, while fluid is being injected into a large artery.\r\nAfter draining a sufficient amount of blood from the body, the vein\r\ntube should be shut off and the arterial injection should continue\r\nuntil the capillaries have been filled to their utmost capacity. This\r\nstrong treatment is advised on account of the early tendencies toward\r\nputrefaction, which is sometimes in an advanced state shortly after\r\ndeath. The cavities should receive a thorough treatment with normal or\r\nsupernormal fluid. Myers advises the re-injection of the cavity in 6 or\r\n8 hours after removing the fluid remaining in the cavity from the first\r\ninjection. As a preventive treatment, this last is a wise precaution.\r\nWhile the cavity treatment is being given the stomach should be entered\r\nby the trocar, relieved of its contents and injected, thus preventing\r\npost-operative purging.\r\n\r\nIn chronic alcoholism, the greatest circulation difficulties will\r\nbe encountered. The capillaries will not receive the fluid, the\r\nputrefactive processes causing the formation of tissue gas early\r\nin the case, which, when coupled to many natural impediments to the\r\ncirculation in cases of this kind, virtually nullifies the circulation\r\nfor fluid distribution. Inject as many arteries as possible, and if\r\nnecessary the veins also. Use the hollow needle or trocar and give\r\nthe unexposed portions of the body a heavy hypodermic injection. The\r\nfluid used in this case should be not less than normal in strength and\r\nin most cases should be at least ¼ over normal. Give the cavities a\r\nvery heavy injection, paying special attention to the food passages.\r\nThis is one of the cases coming to the attention of the embalmer where\r\nevery emphasis must be laid upon the injection of a sufficient amount\r\nof fluid, through as many channels as possible. Do not count the cost\r\nof the fluid in this case, if you value the securing of satisfactory\r\nresults. Cosmetic effect will be enhanced by injection of the carotids\r\nupward with drainage from the internal jugular veins. Finish the case\r\nwith the use of good face powder, unless a discoloration is present,\r\nwhen this should be obliterated with one of the improved methods\r\nmentioned in the chapter on discolorations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Morphinism.=—_Definition._—A chronic intoxication due to the habitual\r\nuse of opium, or some of its alkaloids, especially morphine.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—There are no characteristic tissue changes, other than\r\nthat due to indigestion and malnutrition. At death the patient is\r\nanemic, the skin dry, sallow and inelastic, the heart and blood vessels\r\nshow the effects of poor nutrition, and the tissues generally present\r\na starved appearance. The blood disintegrates, causing a discoloration\r\nof a brownish color, one or two days after death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Drain blood from these cases using half strength fluid\r\nfor the first part of the injection. The more blood obtained, the less\r\nthe danger of discoloration will be. Give the body a thorough cavity\r\ninjection in addition to the arterial injection. If your treatment does\r\nnot eliminate the blood as a factor, the discoloration will occur and\r\nthen it cannot possibly be removed. In this case the use of cosmetics,\r\nif in the hands of a patient operator, will overcome the color.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plumbism.=—_Synonyms._—Lead-poisoning.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A chronic intoxication due to absorption of lead.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—The muscles are atrophied and pale in color.\r\nArteriosclerosis of the cerebral blood vessels is found. There may be\r\nsoftening of the brain and hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Drain blood from the veins while injecting fluid in the\r\narteries. The fluid should be used half strength for the first bottle\r\nof the injection. Massage the face downward to help eliminate any\r\ndiscoloration of blood origin from cerebral hemorrhage. Give the body\r\na thorough injection both as to arteries and cavities. If the face is\r\nunduly pale from this treatment, carmine rouge, judiciously applied\r\nwill lessen the paleness.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Arsenicism.=—_Definition._—A chronic intoxication caused by the\r\ncontinued absorption of arsenic.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Same as for plumbism.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mercurialism.=—_Definition._—A chronic mercurial poisoning, caused,\r\neither by ingestion of the drug, or by inhalation and absorption of the\r\nmineral in the industrial pursuits.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—There is an acute inflammation of the mouth, stomach, and\r\nintestines. The kidneys are inflamed and the liver is degenerated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Drain blood from a large vein while the injection is\r\ngoing on. The first bottle of fluid for the injection should be half\r\nstrength. The cavities should be injected, as intense inflammation\r\ntakes place in the alimentary tract.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heat-Stroke.=—_Synonyms._—Sunstroke.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—Heat-stroke is the result of exposure to intense heat,\r\neither from the direct rays of the sun, or the radiation of blasts or\r\nfurnaces, or to an overheated atmosphere.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—Owing to the excessive heat of the body, putrefactive\r\nchanges occur very early. If a post-mortem examination is made very\r\nsoon after death, the left heart will be found contracted, while the\r\nright heart will be engorged, and the venous trunks filled with dark\r\nsemi-fluid blood. There is also venous engorgement of the brain, spinal\r\ncord, and lungs. Ecchymoses and extravasations of blood are found in\r\nthe skin and mucous membranes.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Drain blood from a large vein during the injection. The\r\nfirst two bottles of the injection should be of half strength fluid.\r\nThe face should be massaged to assist in the securing of capillary\r\ncirculation and in the elimination of the blood discoloration. The body\r\nshould be treated as soon as possible after death, as putrefaction\r\nbegins early. The cavities should have a very thorough treatment,\r\neliminating the gases and injecting normal fluid therein. Should\r\necchymosis occur, obliterate the color by an application of cosmetics.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Obesity.=—_Definition._—An excessive accumulation of fat, impairing\r\nthe bodily functions, or rendering one uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Drain blood from these cases, injecting the first bottle\r\nof fluid half strength followed by normal fluid for the balance of\r\nthe injection. Massage the face downward during the injection. Inject\r\nthe cavities, with special attention to the stomach and intestines.\r\nFor transportation of these cases, govern yourself according to the\r\nprovisions of the transportation laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Elephantiasis.=—_Definition._—A chronic disease caused by inflammation\r\nand obstruction of lymphatics and marked by great thickening of the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Drain blood from these cases and inject normal fluid\r\nsufficient enough in quantity to secure preservation. For long time\r\npreservation, supplement the foregoing treatment by a special injection\r\ninto the thickened extremity, either through an artery leading directly\r\nto the part or by trocar or hollow needle inserted under the skin. Give\r\nthe body a thorough cavity treatment, using normal fluid throughout.\r\nFor transportation, govern yourself according to the provisions of the\r\ntransportation laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drowned Cases.=—_Treatment._—Inject fluid into the lungs by inserting\r\na child's trocar into the windpipe at the upper border of the sternum,\r\nmaking the injection sufficient in strength and amount to fill the\r\nlungs. If this is not done, a bloody purging will take place several\r\nhours after death. Tap the stomach through the epigastric region,\r\naspirate the contents and inject strong fluid before removing the\r\ninstrument. Drain blood from the body during the injection, which\r\nshould be quite heavy and of normal fluid. The last bottle should be\r\nmade 1¼ strength or ¼ over normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Floater.=—_Definition._—A body that has been floating on the water.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The body is distended with gases in the cavities, tissues\r\nand capillaries, putrefaction is in an advanced state, and a vile\r\nodor will be present. If body is to be shipped, aspirate all the gas\r\npossible from the tissues with the hollow needle, injecting strong\r\nfluid in the same openings. Open the body from the base of the neck\r\nto the pubic bone, relieve the gases in the alimentary tract and\r\nlungs, and fill cavity thoroughly with hardening compound, after\r\nwhich it should be sewed up. Inject as many arteries as possible with\r\nvery strong fluid. Dress the body and place it in a metallic casket.\r\nPour the contents of two pound bottles of Platt's chlorides on the\r\nunderclothing to assist in deodorizing the body. Do not open the casket\r\nafter it is once sealed.\r\n\r\nIf the body is not to be shipped, it will be advisable to deodorize it\r\nas much as possible and bury it without delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mother and Unborn Child.=—_Mother and Foetus in Utero._\r\n—_Treatment._—Before pregnancy has reached the three months\r\nstage, the child will receive fluid directly from the circulation\r\nconnected with the mother.\r\n\r\nAfter the three months stage, the circulation, by direct flow, is\r\nstopped and fluid could only reach the foetus by absorption from the\r\nplacenta. This is naturally insufficient to preserve the child, which\r\nby this time is immersed in the liquor amnii (water of the womb) and\r\nwhich is subject to early putrefaction in that situation. The trocar\r\nshould be directed to the uterus or womb from a point on the median\r\nline, half way from the umbilicus to the pubic arch, care being taken\r\nto reach the water which surrounds the foetus. Withdraw the water,\r\nand inject as much strong fluid as possible so that the foetus will\r\nbe surrounded with fluid, and in that way preserved. If the trocar\r\nenters the body of the child, this will not occur, so the instrument\r\nshould be carefully manipulated to reach the space between the child\r\nand the uterine wall. The mother should receive a very heavy arterial\r\nand cavity injection, with full drainage of blood. The vulva should be\r\nclosed with absorbent cotton. The face should be massaged thoroughly\r\ntoward the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Senility.=—_Synonyms._—Old age.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—A state of decline in an aged person characterized by\r\nprogressive atrophy of all the tissues and organs.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._—Excessive shrinking and obliteration takes place among\r\nthe capillaries. The skin becomes diminished in thickness. When this\r\noccurs, it is easily seen why in old age there will follow, after the\r\ninjection of fluid into the arterial system, greenish, brownish, and\r\nsoft spots, in the different parts of the body, especially notable in\r\nthe face, neck and hands. The products of degeneration may accumulate\r\nin the tissues and cause them to be thicker than they are in health,\r\nas is seen in the vessels, the walls of which are much thicker than\r\nnormal. The blood contains fewer corpuscles and solid constituents, is\r\nmore watery, and coagulates more readily; also the total quantity is\r\nless. The pericardium, endocardium, and the capsules of the liver and\r\nspleen are opaque and toughened. Degeneration of the cardiac substance\r\nmay lead to a state of asthenia, which generally produces death.\r\nDilatation of the orifices of the heart may be the prominent lesion,\r\nor they may be contracted by atheroma, or by thickening of the vales\r\nor rings. The lungs are changed more or less, increasing the bronchial\r\nsecretions, which during life have been attended by severe paroxysms of\r\ncoughing.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—Inject half strength fluid for the first bottle, following\r\nthat with ¾ strength for the second and normal for the third and all\r\nthereafter if more be necessary. Blood may be drained from the vein if\r\nthe operator thinks it advisable. The commercial face solution or water\r\nshould be used on the face while massaging in order that the skin may\r\nbe kept moist and to prevent dessication from the action of the fluid.\r\nThe cavity should be injected as a matter of precaution.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gangrene.=—_Synonyms._—Senile gangrene; mortification.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—Putrefactive fermentation of dead tissue, from various\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._—The extremities are affected in senile gangrene. They\r\nshould be wrapped with absorbent cotton which should then be saturated\r\nwith fluid. The body itself should receive the same treatment accorded\r\nin the paragraph on senility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n(References are to pages.)\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Abdomen, 101, 254\r\n
