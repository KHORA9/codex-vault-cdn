Army Neuropsychiatric Training School at Boston, 1917-18. This\r\nparticular school had to adapt itself to the clinical material of the\r\nPsychopathic Hospital. Although war cases early began to drift into the\r\nwards (even including some overseas material), it was thought well to\r\nsupplement the ordinary “acute, curable, and incipient” mental cases of\r\nthe hospital wards and out-patient service with representative cases\r\nfrom the literature.\r\n\r\nAs time wore on, this “preparedness” ideal gave place to the ideal of\r\na collection of cases to serve as a source-book for reconstructionists\r\ndealing with neuroses and psychoses. Shortage of medical staff and\r\ndelays incidental to the influenza epidemic held the book back still\r\nfurther, and, as meantime Brown and Williams had served the immediate\r\nneed with their _Neuropsychiatry and the War_, it was determined to\r\nmake the compilation the beginning of a case-history book on the\r\nneuropsychiatry of the war, following in part the traditions of various\r\ncase-books in law and medicine.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the armistice, there is by no means an end of\r\nthese problems. Peace-practice in neuropsychiatry is bound to undergo\r\ngreat changes and improvements, if only from the influx into the\r\npeace-community of many more trained neuropsychiatrists than were\r\never before available. This is particularly true in the American\r\ncommunity by reason of the many good men specially trained in camp and\r\nhospital neuropsychiatry, both at home and in the A. E. F., through the\r\nenlightened policy of our army in establishing special divisions of the\r\nSurgeon-General’s Office dealing separately with those problems.\r\n\r\nThough a book primarily for physicians, some of its material has\r\ninterest for _line-officers_, who may see how much “criming” is matter\r\nfor medical experts, by running through the boxed headings (especially\r\nof Sections A and B) and reading the simulation cases. As Chavigny\r\nremarks, “shooting madmen neither restrains crime nor sets a good\r\nexample.”\r\n\r\nBut parts of the book look ahead to _Reconstruction_. Surely\r\noccupation-workers, vocationalists, war risk insurance experts, and\r\nin fact all reconstructionists, medical and lay, must find much to\r\ntheir advantage in the data of Section D (Treatment and Results). Had\r\ntime permitted, the whole old story of “Railway Spine”--Shell-shock’s\r\ncongener--might have been covered in a series of cases from last\r\ncentury’s literature, together with others illustrating the effects of\r\nsuggestion and psychotherapy; but this must be a post-bellum task.\r\n\r\nThe compiler, who has personally dictated (and as a rule redictated\r\nand twice condensed) all the cases from the originals (or in a few\r\ninstances, _e.g._, Russian, from translations), hopes he has not added\r\nanything new to the accounts. The cases are drawn from the literature\r\nof the belligerents, 1914-1917, English, French, Italian, Russian,\r\nand--so far as available here--German and Austrian.\r\n\r\nI would call the collection not so much a posey of other men’s flowers\r\nas a handful of their _seeds_. For I have constantly not so much\r\ntranscribed men’s general conclusions as borrowed their specific\r\nfine-print and footnotes. The lure of the 100 per cent has been very\r\nstrong in many authors; but the test of fine-print, viz., of the\r\nactual case-protocols, saves us from premature conclusions, and the\r\nplan of the book allows us to confront actualities with actualities.\r\nOne gets the impression of a dignified debate from the way in which\r\ncase-histories automatically confront each other, say in Section C\r\n(Diagnosis).\r\n\r\nObligations to the books of Babinski and Froment, Eder, Hurst, Mott\r\n(Lettsomian Lectures), Roussy and Lhermitte, Elliot Smith and Pear,\r\nand others are obvious. Yealland’s book came too late for sampling its\r\nmiracles, though cases of his in the periodical literature had already\r\nbeen incorporated in my selection.\r\n\r\nSome of the cases in Section A, I, had already been abstracted in\r\nNeurosyphilis: Modern Systematic Diagnosis and Treatment (Southard and\r\nSolomon, 1917).\r\n\r\nWhat we actually have made is a case-history book in the newly\r\ncombined fields now collectively termed _neuropsychiatry_. The\r\nmore _general_ the good general practitioner of medicine, the more\r\nof a _neuropsychiatrist_! And this is no pious wish or counsel of\r\nperfection. Neuropsychiatry, mental hygiene, psychotherapy and\r\nsomatotherapy--all these will flourish intra-bellum and post-bellum,\r\nin days of destruction and in days of reconstruction. And who amongst\r\nus, medical or lay, will not have to deal in reconstruction days with\r\ncases like some here compiled? A minor blessing of the war will be the\r\nincorporation of mental hygiene in general medical practice and in\r\nauxiliary fields of applied sociology, _e.g._, medico-social work.\r\n\r\nSubsidies aiding publication are due to the National Committee for\r\nMental Hygiene; the Permanent Charity Foundation (Boston Safe Deposit\r\nand Trust Company); Mrs. Zoe D. Underhill of New York; Mr. H. T. White\r\nof New York; and Dr. W. N. Bullard of Boston--to all of these the\r\nvarious military recipients of the book will be under obligations,\r\nas well as others who would otherwise have had to pay the great\r\n_majoration de prix_ due to war times.\r\n\r\nOf those great dead contributors to neurology laid (in the Epicrisis)\r\nat the feet of the neo-Attila, perhaps only Sir Victor was in a narrow\r\nsense the Kaiser’s victim: still, but for the war, they might all\r\nremain to us.\r\n\r\nBy the way, just as I found John Milton had said things that fitted\r\nneurosyphilis, so also Dante is observed in the chosen mottoes to have\r\nhad inklings even of Shell-shock. To the _Inferno_ it was natural to\r\nturn for fitting mottoes (Carlyle’s renderings mainly used). The pages\r\nmight have been strewn with them. A glint of too great optimism might\r\nseem to shine--in the pre-Epicrisis motto--from the lance of Achilles\r\nwith its “sad yet healing gift;” but out of Shell-shock Man may get to\r\nknow his own mind a little better, how under stress and strain the mind\r\nlags, blocks, twists, shrinks, and even splits, but on the whole is\r\nafterwards made good again.\r\n\r\n                                                        E. E. SOUTHARD.\r\n\r\n    WASHINGTON,\r\n      _November, 1918_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duties of an introducer, whether of a platform speaker to an\r\naudience, or of a writer to his anticipated readers, are not always\r\nclearly defined. It has been sometimes said that the critic or reviewer\r\nmay meet with better success if he has not acquainted himself too\r\nthoroughly with the contents of the book about which he writes, as in\r\nthat case he will have a larger opportunity to indulge his imagination,\r\nbut a critique thus produced may have the disadvantage of possible\r\nshortcoming or unfairness. In the case of this volume, however, I have\r\nfelt it worth while to acquaint myself with its contents, no light task\r\nwhen one is confronted with a thousand pages.\r\n\r\nThe great war just closing has done much to enlighten us as to the\r\ncauses, nature, outcome, and treatment of injuries and diseases to\r\nwhich its victims have been subjected. The object of this book is\r\nto present both the data and the principles involved in certain\r\nneuropsychiatry problems of the war. These are presented in a wealth\r\nof detail through an extraordinary series of case records (589 in\r\nall) drawn from current medical literature, during the first three\r\nyears of the conflict. Case reporting is here seen at its best, and\r\nthe experiences recorded are largely allowed to speak for themselves,\r\nalthough comments are not wanting and are often illuminating.\r\n\r\nMany criticisms have been heard on the use of the term _Shell-shock_\r\nas applied to some of the most important psychiatric and neurological\r\nproblems of the recent war; but that the designation has meaning will\r\nbe evident if Dr. Southard’s book is not simply skimmed over by the\r\nreader, but is studied in its entirety. The symptoms of a very large\r\nnumber, if not the majority, of the cases recorded, had for their\r\ninitiating influence the psychic and physical horrors of life among\r\nexploding shells. As the author and those from whom he has received\r\nhis clinical supply not infrequently point out, in many cases it would\r\nappear that purely psychic influences have played the chief rôle, but\r\nin others physical injuries have not been lacking. Much more than\r\nthis is true: in many instances the soil was prepared by previous\r\ndefect, disease, or injury, or to use one of Dr. Southard’s favorite\r\nexpressions, “weak spots” were present before martial causes became\r\noperative.\r\n\r\nWhile the contributions to the medical and surgical history of the\r\nwar have been somewhat numerous in current medical journals and in\r\nmonographs, few comprehensive volumes have appeared. The reasons for\r\nthis are not far to seek. The conflict has been of such magnitude, and\r\nthe demands on the bodily and mental activity of the medical profession\r\nhave been so intense and continuous, that time and opportunity for\r\nthe careful and complete recording of experiences have not been often\r\navailable; but works are beginning to appear in the languages of all\r\nthe belligerent countries and these will increase in number and value\r\nduring the next lustrum and decade, although it may be that some of the\r\nmost important contributions will come after a decade or more is past.\r\nThe great work before me is one that will leave its lasting impress,\r\nnot only upon military but on civil medicine, for the lessons to be\r\ndrawn from its pages are in large part as applicable to the one as to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nLooking backward to our Civil War, one is strongly impressed with the\r\nfact that the present volume, one of the earliest works of its kind\r\nto appear in book form, deals largely with psychiatry and functional\r\nnervous diseases, whereas during and after the American conflict the\r\nmost important contributions to neurology related to organic disease,\r\nespecially as illustrated by the work of Weir Mitchell and his\r\ncollaborators on injuries of nerves. This is the more interesting when\r\nit is remembered that Mitchell not very long after the close of the\r\nCivil War became the most prominent exponent of functional neurology,\r\nfrom the diagnostic and therapeutic sides. To him the profession the\r\nworld over has been indebted for the development of new views as to\r\nthe nature of neurasthenia and hysteria and new methods for combating\r\nthese disorders. In this fact is to be found matter for thought. Those\r\nwho handled best the neuropsychiatric problems of the present war were\r\nin large part qualified not merely by a knowledge of psychology and\r\npsychiatry, but far more by a thorough training in organic neurology.\r\nThe problems of psychiatry can be grasped fully only by those who have\r\na fundamental knowledge of the anatomy, physiology, and diseases of the\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\nDr. Southard, preëminently a neuropathologist, is well grounded in\r\norganic neurology, and shows at every turn his capabilities for\r\nconsidering the neuroses, psychoses, and insanities from the standpoint\r\nof the neurologist. Moreover, he clearly shows training and insight\r\ninto the problems of non-neurological internal medicine.\r\n\r\nThe ideal method of training a student for neuropsychiatric work--if\r\none had the opportunity of directing his course from the time of his\r\nentry into medicine--would be to see to it, after a good grounding in\r\nthe fundamental sciences like anatomy, physiology, and chemistry, that\r\nmedicine and surgery in their broadest phases first received school and\r\nhospital attention; that the fields of neurology, pure and applied,\r\nwere then fully explored; and that psychology and psychiatry received\r\nlate but thorough consideration. When after America’s entrance into the\r\nworld war the writer assisted in preparing medical reserve officers\r\nfor neuropsychiatric service, those men did best both during their\r\npostgraduate work and in base hospitals and in the field, who had built\r\nfrom the bottom after the manner indicated.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of Dr. Southard’s book, for more than two hundred and\r\nfifty pages, the author considers under ten subdivisions the acquired\r\ndiseases and constitutional defects which may predispose the soldier\r\nto functional and reflex nervous disease. Neurosyphilis, on which Dr.\r\nSouthard and Dr. Solomon have already given us a valuable treatise,\r\nthe pharmacopsychoses, especially alcoholism, and the somatopsychoses\r\ncovering fevers like typhoid and paratyphoid, are considered in\r\nnumerous carefully chosen case reports. The reader needs only to look\r\nclosely into the case records of the first quarter of the volume to\r\nget a knowledge of the affections chiefly predisposing the soldier or\r\ncivilian to functional and reflex nervous diseases. To those familiar\r\nwith the medical history of the war it is well known that one of the\r\nreasons for the efficiency of the American Expeditionary Force resided\r\nin the fact that the preliminary examinations of the recruits received\r\nthe fullest attention not only from the points of view of acquired and\r\ninherited disease, but also from those of special psychiatric and even\r\npsychological deficiencies. Our country, however, had for its guidance\r\nthe experience of nations which were fighting for three years before we\r\nentered the arena and in addition had a large surplus of material from\r\nwhich to cull out the weaklings.\r\n\r\nAmong the predispositional affections considered--besides syphilis,\r\nalcohol, and other drug habits, and the somatopsychoses--are the\r\nfeeble-mindednesses or hypophrenoses, the epilepsies, the psychoses\r\ndue to focal brain lesions, the presenile and senile disorders, the\r\nschizophrenoses including dementia præcox and allied affections, the\r\ncyclothymoses like manic depressive insanity, the psychoneuroses, and\r\nthe psychopathoses. The last two subjects indicated, considered in\r\nspecial chapters, seem to some extent to be receptacles for affections\r\nwhich cannot well be otherwise placed,--hallucinoses, hysteria,\r\nneurasthenia, and psychasthenia,--and under the psychopathoses,\r\npathological lying, Bolshevism, delinquencies of various sorts,\r\nhomosexuality, suicide and self-mutilation, nosophobia, and even\r\nclaustrophobia with its exemplar who preferred exposure to shell-fire\r\nto remaining in a tunnel.\r\n\r\nUnder the encephalopsychoses are found interesting illustrations of\r\nfocal lesions and the general effects of infection and toxemia. Cases\r\nof brain abscess, of spinal focal lesions, and meningeal hemorrhage\r\nare in evidence, aphasias, monoplegias, Jacksonian spasm, and thalamic\r\ndisease receiving consideration.\r\n\r\nAll neurologists know the difficulties in diagnosticating epilepsy\r\nin the absence of opportunities to see attacks and to receive the\r\ncarefully analyzed statement of the observers of the patient. All this\r\nand much more is well brought out in the chapter on the epileptoses.\r\nMany epileptics found their way into the armies either through the\r\ncarelessness of examiners or by suppression of the facts on the part of\r\nthose who desired to serve.\r\n\r\nThe fact that an imbecile can shoot straight and face fire comes out in\r\none or two places, but this does not seem to prove that a good rifleman\r\nis necessarily an all-round good soldier.\r\n\r\nA book like Dr. Southard’s could be made of much use in teaching\r\nstudents, especially postgraduates, by having them, when a particular\r\nsubject like epilepsy or schizophrenia, for instance, is under\r\ndiscussion, use as collateral reading the case reports of this work.\r\n\r\nDr. Southard’s book will prove useful to many workers--to the medical\r\nofficer whose duty it is to examine recruits for the service or to pass\r\nupon and treat them while in service; almost equally to the medical\r\nofficer in time of peace; to authors of textbooks and treatises and to\r\ncontributors to neurological and psychiatric journals; to lecturers and\r\nclinical demonstrators; to the examiner for the juvenile courts; and to\r\nmembers of the psychopathic, psychiatric, and neurological staffs of\r\nour hospitals.\r\n\r\nOne is not called upon in an introduction to review at length the\r\ncontents of the volume, but it may prove of value to the reader to dip\r\nhere and there into the pages of the work to which his attention is\r\nbeing invited.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that fifty years ago and much later, down to\r\nthe time of Babinski’s active propaganda in favor of the theories of\r\nsuggestion, counter-suggestion, and persuasion in hysteria, various\r\naffections of a vasomotor and thermic type were included in the list\r\nof hysterical phenomena. These and some other phenomena sometimes\r\nclassed as hysterical, Babinski and those who accord with him now find\r\nit necessary to sweep entirely from the domain of hysteria, which being\r\nproduced by suggestion and cured by counter-suggestion or persuasion\r\ncannot include symptoms which are beyond the control of the will and\r\nintellect of the patient.\r\n\r\nAccording to the new or rather revived pronouncement, these must be due\r\neither to definite organic lesion, or to a disorder of reflex origin,\r\nconnoting the occurrence of changes in the nervous centers as long\r\nago taught by Vulpian and Charcot. In the records of cases and in the\r\ndiscussions thereon this differentiation receives much consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is held that the paralysis in the reflex cases is more limited, more\r\npersistent, and assumes special forms not observable in hysteria. The\r\nattitudes in hysterical palsies conform more to the natural positions\r\nof the limbs than do those observed in reflex paralysis. Probably the\r\npresence of marked amyotrophies in the reflex nervous disorders is the\r\nmost convincing factor in separating these from pithiatic affections.\r\nThese atrophies correspond to the arthritic muscular atrophies of\r\nVulpian, Charcot, Gowers, and others, and cannot for a moment be\r\nregarded as caused by suggestion or as removable by counter-suggestion\r\nor persuasion. They are influenced, discounting the effect of time\r\nand natural recuperation, only by methods of treatment designed to\r\nimprove the peripheral and central nutrition of the patient. Pithiatic\r\natrophies are slight and probably always to be accounted for by\r\ndisuse or the association of some peripheral neural disorder with the\r\nhysteria. Affections of the sudatory and pilatory systems are more\r\ndefinitely pronounced in reflex cases than in those of a strictly\r\nhysterical character.\r\n\r\nSome of the facts brought forward by Babinski and Froment to\r\ndemonstrate the differentiation of reflex paralyses from pithiatic\r\ndisorders of motion are challenged in the records of this volume by\r\nothers, as for instance, by Dejerine, Roussy, Marie, and Guillain.\r\nBabinski tells us that in pithiatism, properly so designated, the\r\ntendon reflexes are not affected. He believes that even in pronounced\r\nanesthesia of the lower extremities the plantar reflexes can always\r\nbe elicited and are not abnormal in exhibition. Dejerine, however,\r\nproduces cases to illustrate the fact that in marked hysterical\r\nanesthesia of the feet plantar responses cannot be produced. I have\r\npersonally studied cases which lend some strength to either contention.\r\nIn some of these I was not able to conclude that either the use of the\r\nwill or the presence of contractions in extension was sufficient to\r\nexclude the normal responses.\r\n\r\nDifferences in muscle tonicity, in mechanical irritability of the\r\nmuscles, and the presence or absence of fibrotendinous contractions are\r\nindications of a separation between the reflex and purely functional\r\ncases, as apparently demonstrated in some of the case records. True\r\ntrophic disorders of the skin, hair, and bones observed in the reflex\r\ncases are also said to have no place in the illustrations of pithiatism.\r\n\r\nThe delver into the case histories of this volume will find numerous\r\ninstructive combinations of hystero-reflex and organo-hysterical\r\nassociations which are not to be enumerated in an introduction. The\r\ngreat importance of what all recognize as pathognomonic signs of\r\norganic disease--Babinski extensor toe response, persistent foot\r\nclonus, reactions of degeneration, marked atrophy, lost tendon\r\njerks, etc.--is, of course, continuously in evidence. Extraordinary\r\nassociations of hysterical, organic, and reflex disorders with other\r\naffections due to direct involvement of bone, muscle, and vessels and\r\nwith the secondary effects of cicatrization and immobilization are\r\nbrought out on many pages. In quitting this branch of our subject\r\nit might be remarked that considerable changes must be made in\r\nour textbook descriptions of nervous diseases in the light of the\r\ncontributions to the neurology of the present war.\r\n\r\nOne is reminded in the details of some of the cases of the discussions\r\nsome decades since on the subject of spinal traumatisms; of the work\r\nof Erichsen which resulted in giving his name and that of “railway\r\nspine” to many of the cases now commonly spoken of as traumatic\r\nhysteria and traumatic neurasthenia; of the rejoinders of Page and his\r\nviews regarding spinal traumatisms; and of Oppenheim’s development of\r\nthe symptom complex of what he prefers to term the traumatic neurosis.\r\nOne who has taken part in much court work cannot but read these case\r\nrecords with interest, for the neurology of the war as presented in\r\nthis volume and in numerous monographs which are now appearing, throws\r\nmuch light upon many often mooted medicolegal problems. I recall\r\nhow many able and honest neurological observers have changed their\r\npoints of view since the early days of Erichsen’s “railway spine,” a\r\npathological suggestion which is said to have cost the corporations of\r\nEngland an almost fabulous sum during a score of years. I recall also\r\nthat a certain Court of Appeals in one of our states even felt itself\r\ncalled upon to promulgate an opinion intended to exorcise entirely the\r\nplea for damages for alleged injuries if it could be shown that these\r\nwere due to fright. The data of this book do not put weapons entirely\r\ninto the hands of the attorney and the expert for either the plaintiff\r\nor the defendant.\r\n\r\nSome of the French writers on the neurology of the war, as illustrated\r\nin the records collected by Dr. Southard, have brought to our attention\r\ndistinctions which they draw between _états commotionnels_ and _états\r\némotionnels_--happy terms, and yet not sufficient in their invention\r\nor in the explanations which accompany them, fully to satisfy the\r\nrequirements of the facts presented. These writers seem to think of\r\nthe commotional states as denoting some real disease or condition of\r\nthe brain, and yet one which is really curable and reversible. They\r\nexplicitly tell us, however, that these commotions fall short of\r\nbeing _lésionnel_. After all, is this not somewhat obscure? Is it not\r\nsomething of a return to the period of “railway spine” when one of the\r\ncomparisons sometimes made was that the injury suffered by the nervous\r\ntissues produced in them a state comparable to that of a magnet\r\nwhich had been subjected to a severe blow? At any rate, in commotion\r\nthus discussed the nervous structures are supposed to sustain some\r\nreal injury of a physiochemical character, whereas in the emotional\r\nstates the neurones are, as Southard puts it, affected somewhat after\r\nthe manner of normal emotional functioning, except perhaps that they\r\nare called upon to deliver an excessive stream of impulses. The\r\nlatter would be classed among the psychopathic, the former among the\r\nphysiopathic affections, and yet the distinction between the two is not\r\nalways quite clear.\r\n\r\nIn not a few instances of Shell-shock--although these are not numerous,\r\nso far as records have been obtained--actual structural lesions have\r\nbeen recorded even in cases in which no direct external injury of a\r\nmaterial kind was experienced as a result of the explosion of shells.\r\nIn others the evidences of external injury were relatively unimportant.\r\nVarious lesions, in some cases recognizable even by the naked eye, were\r\npresent. Mott, for example, found not only minute hemorrhages, but\r\nin one instance a bulbar extravasation of moderate massiveness, the\r\npatient not showing external signs of injury. Cases are also recorded\r\nof hematomyelia; others with edematous or necrotic areas in the cord;\r\nand still others with lesions of the ependyma or even with splitting of\r\nthe spinal canal, reminding one of the classical experiments of Duret\r\non cerebral and cerebrospinal traumatisms.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that too much stress should not be laid on a few\r\ncases of this sort--but are they as few as they seem to be? The fact\r\nis that necropsical opportunities are not often afforded. May not such\r\nscattered lesions often be present without resulting in death or even\r\nin long continued disturbance? There is no essential reason why minute\r\nhemorrhages into the brain and spinal cord, and especially into their\r\nmembranes, may not undergo rapid absorption or even remain unchanged\r\nfor some time without dire results.\r\n\r\nOne of the reported cases in which lung splitting occurred from severe\r\nconcussion without external injury is not without interest in this\r\nconnection, reminding one, as the commentator says, of those cases of\r\nsevere concussion in which the interior of a building is injured while\r\nthe exterior escapes. In the same connection also the cited experiments\r\nof Mairet and Durante on rabbits are not without instructiveness.\r\nAs a result of explosives set off close to these animals, pulmonary\r\napoplexy, spinal cord and root hemorrhages, and extravasations,\r\nperivascular and ependymal, and into the cortical and bulbar gray were\r\nfound. Russca obtained direct and _contrecoup_ brain lesions, etc., in\r\na similar way.\r\n\r\nHere and there throughout the book will be found references to\r\nsymptoms and syndromes which will have a particular interest for the\r\nreader--soldier’s heart, trench foot, congealed hand, tics, tremors,\r\nconvulsions, sensory areas variously mapped, and forms of local\r\ntetanus, the last being distinctly to be differentiated from pithiatic\r\ncontractures and those due to organic lesions of the nervous system.\r\nCases of an affection described by Souques as camptocormia, from Greek\r\nwords meaning to bend the trunk, were shown to the Neurological Society\r\nof Paris in 1914 and later, the main features of this affection being\r\npronounced incurvation forward of the trunk from the dorsolumbar\r\nregion, with extreme abduction and outward rotation of the lower limbs,\r\npain in the back, and difficult and tremulous walking. In some of these\r\ncases, organic lesions of the trunkal tissues were present, but in\r\naddition psychic elements played a not unimportant part, and the cases\r\nwere restored to health by a combination of physical measures with\r\npsychotherapy, enforced by electrical applications.\r\n\r\nThe part of this book given over to the discussion of treatment will\r\ndoubtless to some prove the most interesting section. The presentation\r\nof the subject of therapeutics is in some degree a discussion also of\r\ndiagnosis and prognosis; and so it happens in various parts of the\r\nvolume that the particular subject under consideration is more or less\r\na reaffirmation or anticipation of remarks under other headings.\r\n\r\nSimilar results are brought about by various therapeutic procedures.\r\nNonne, Myers, and a few others bring hypnosis into the foreground,\r\nalthough non-hypnotic suggestion plays a larger rôle by far.\r\n\r\nMiracle cures are wrought through many pages. Mutism, deafness and\r\nblindness, palsies, contractures, and tics disappear at times as if by\r\nmagic under various forms of suggestion. Ether or chloroform narcosis\r\ndrives out the malady at the moment when it reveals its true nature.\r\nVerbal suggestion has many adjuvants and collaborators--electricity,\r\nsometimes severely administered, lumbar puncture, injections of\r\nstovaine into the cerebrospinal fluid, injections of saline solution,\r\ncolored lights, vibrations, active mechanotherapy, hydrotherapy, hot\r\nair baths and blasts, massage, etc. Painful and punitive measures have\r\ntheir place--one is inclined to think a less valuable place than is\r\ngiven them by some of the recorders. In some instances the element of\r\nsuggestion, while doubtless present, is overshadowed by the material\r\nmethods employed. Persuasion and actual physical improvement are in\r\nthese cases highly important. Reëducation is not infrequently in\r\nevidence. The patient in one way or another is taught how to do things\r\nwhich he had lost the way of doing.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to American neurologists to note how frequently\r\nin the reports, especially of French observers, the “Weir Mitchell\r\ntreatment” was the method employed, including isolation, the faradic\r\ncurrent, massage, and Swedish movements, hydrotherapy, dietetic\r\nmeasures, reëducative processes, and powerful suggestion variously\r\nexhibited, especially through the mastery of the physician over\r\nthe patient. It is rather striking that few records of Freudian\r\npsychoanalytic therapy are presented.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said, however, counter-suggestion and persuasion, in\r\nwhatever guise made use of, were not always sufficient and this not\r\nonly in the clearly organic cases, but in those which are ranked under\r\nthe head of reflex nervous disorders. In these the long-continued use\r\nof physical agencies was found necessary to supplement the purely\r\npsychic procedures, these facts sometimes giving rise in the Paris\r\nSociety of Neurology and elsewhere to animated discussion as to the\r\nreal nature of the cases. The pithiatic features of the case at times\r\ndisappear, but leave behind much to be explained and more to be\r\naccomplished. The cures wrought are not always permanent and in some\r\ncases post-bellum experiences may be required to prove the real value\r\nof the measures advocated. The reader must study well the detailed\r\nrecords in order to arrive at just conclusions; nevertheless, the\r\ntremendous efficacy of suggestion and persuasion stands out in many of\r\nthe recitals.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the author may permit the introducer a little liberty of\r\ncomment. His non-English interpellations, especially Latin and French,\r\nmay be regarded by some as overdone or perhaps pedantic, but are rather\r\npiquant, giving zest to the text. _Diagnosis per exclusionem in ordine_\r\nis sonorous and has a scholarly flavor, but does not prevent the reader\r\nwho lives beyond the faubourgs of Boston from understanding that the\r\nauthor is speaking of an ancient and well-tried method of differential\r\ndiagnosis. _Passim_ may be more impressive or thought-fixing than\r\nits English translation, but this to the reader will simply prove\r\na matter of individual opinion. _Psychopathia martialis_ is not\r\nonly mouth-filling like _Senegambia_ or _Mesopotamia_, but really\r\nhas a claim to appreciation through its evident applicability. It\r\nis agreeable to note that the book seems nowhere to indicate that\r\n_psychopathia sexualis_ and _psychopathia martialis_ are convertible\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThe bibliography of the volume challenges admiration because of its\r\nmagnitude and thoroughness and is largely to be credited, as the author\r\nindicates, to the energy and efficiency of Sergeant Norman Fenton, who\r\ndid the work in connection with the Neuropsychiatric Training School\r\nat Boston, resorting first-hand to the Boston Medical Library and the\r\nLibrary of the New York Academy of Medicine. After Sergeant Fenton\r\njoined the American Expeditionary Force, Dr. Southard greatly increased\r\nthe value of the bibliography by his personal efforts.\r\n\r\nThis bibliography covers not only the 589 case histories of the book,\r\nbut it goes beyond this, especially in the presentation of references\r\nfor 1917, 1918, and even 1919. Owing to the time when our country\r\nentered the war, American references are, in the main, of later date\r\nthan the case histories. They will be found none the less of value to\r\nthe student of neuropsychiatric problems.\r\n\r\nThe references in the bibliography number in all more than two\r\nthousand, distributed so far as nationalities are concerned about\r\nas given below, although some mistakes may have crept into this\r\nenumeration for various reasons, like the publication of the same\r\narticles in the journals of different countries. The list of references\r\nincludes French, 895; British (English and Colonial), 396; Italian,\r\n77; Russian, 100; American, 253; Spanish, 5; Dutch, 5; Scandinavian,\r\n5; and Austrian and German, 476. It will be seen, therefore, that the\r\nbibliography covers in number nearly four times the collected case\r\nstudies, most of these records being from reports made during the first\r\nthree years of the war. The author has wisely made an effort to bring\r\nthe bibliographic work up to and partially including 1919.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the French neurologists and alienists continued\r\ntheir work during the strenuous days of the terrible conflict is\r\nworthy of all praise. The labors of the Society of Neurology of Paris\r\nnever flagged, its contributions in current medical journals having\r\nbecome familiar to neurologists who have followed closely the trend of\r\nmedical events during the war. Cases and subjects were also frequently\r\npresented and discussed at the neurological centers connected with the\r\nFrench and allied armies in France.\r\n\r\nIt may be almost invidious to specify names, the work done by many\r\nwas of so much interest and value. Dejerine in the early days of the\r\nwar, before his untimely sickness and death, contributed his part.\r\nMarie from the beginning to the end of the conflict continued to\r\nmake the neurological world his debtor. The name of Babinski stands\r\nout in striking relief. Other names frequently appearing among the\r\nFrench contributors are those of Froment, Clovis Vincent, Roussy\r\nand Lhermitte, Léri, Guillain, Souques, Laignel-Lavastine, Courbon,\r\nGrasset, Claude, Barre, Benisty, Foix, Chavigny, Charpentier, Meige,\r\nThomas, and Sollier.\r\n\r\nFor a work of this character not only as complete a bibliography as\r\npossible, but a thorough index is absolutely necessary, and this has\r\nbeen supplied. The author has not made the index too full, but with\r\nenough cross-references to enable those in all lines of medical work\r\ninterested to cull out the cases and comments which most concern them.\r\n\r\nMy prologue finished, I step aside for the play and the player, with\r\nthe recommendation to the reader that he give close heed to the\r\nperformance--to the recital of the cases, the comments thereon, and the\r\ngeneral discussion of subjects--knowing that such attention will be\r\nfully rewarded, for in this wonderful collection of Dr. Southard is to\r\nbe seen an epitome of war neurology not elsewhere to be found.\r\n\r\n                                                      CHARLES K.

PSYCHOSES INCIDENTAL IN THE WAR\r\n\r\n    La divina giustizia di qua punge\r\n      quell’ Attila che fu flagello in terra.\r\n\r\n    Divine justice here torments that Attila, who\r\n      was a scourge on earth.\r\n\r\n                      Inferno, Canto xii, 133-134.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data from all the belligerent countries, collected in this book, go\r\nfar to prove that, whatever at last you elect to term Shell-shock, you\r\nmust pause to consider whether your putative case is not actually:\r\n\r\nA matter of spirochetes?\r\n\r\nThe response of a subnormal soldier?\r\n\r\nAn equivalent of epilepsy?\r\n\r\nAn alcoholic situation?\r\n\r\nA result of neurones actually _hors de combat_?\r\n\r\nA state of bodily weakness (perhaps of _faiblesse irritable_)?\r\n\r\nA bit of dementia praecox?\r\n\r\nOne of the ups and downs of the emotional (affective, cyclothymic)\r\npsychoses?\r\n\r\nAn odd psychopathic reaction in which the response is abnormal not so\r\nmuch by reason of excessive stimulus as by reason of defective power of\r\nresponse?\r\n\r\nOn a simpler basis, is not our Shell-shocker just a banal example of\r\nhysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia; and is not this psychoneurotic\r\nmore peculiar in his capacity to be shocked than are the conditions\r\nthat purvey the shocks?\r\n\r\nPut more concretely in the terms of available tests and criteria,\r\nopen to the psychiatrist, does not every putative Shell-shock soldier\r\ndeserve at some stage a blood test for syphilis? Should we not be\r\nreasonably sure we are not facing a man inadequate to start with, so\r\nfar as mental tests avail? Should we not verify (even at considerable\r\nexpense of time and money by so-called “social service” methods) the\r\nfacts of epilepsy and epileptic taint? Of alcoholism? And so on? There\r\ncan be no two answers to these questions.\r\n\r\nUpon the following page is a practical grouping of mental diseases,\r\ndevised in the first place, not for war psychoses, but for the\r\ninitial sifting of psychopathic hospital cases. Now the psychopathic\r\nhospital group of cases constitutes in peace practice the closest\r\nanalogue of the mental cases met in active military practice, because\r\nthe “incipient, acute, and curable”[1] cases, for which psychopathic\r\nhospitals are built and which flock to or are sent to the wards and\r\noutdoor departments of such hospitals, are precisely the cases that\r\nearly come forward in active military practice. They are precisely the\r\ncases in which that pathological event--whatever it is--we know as\r\nShell-shock may be expected to develop. It is precisely the “incipient,\r\nacute, and curable” instances of mental disease which we hope to\r\nexclude from our American army by cis-Atlantic winnowing-out at the\r\nhands of neuropsychiatric experts--the best preventive we hope both of\r\nShell-shock and of other worse mental conditions, if such there be.\r\nMilitary mental practice plainly deals, not so much with frank and\r\ncommittable insanity, as with mental diseases of a medically milder but\r\na militarily far more insidious nature.\r\n\r\n    [1] Official phrase for the scope of the Psychopathic Hospital,\r\n    Boston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nA further inspection of this grouping of mental diseases shows not\r\nonly that it contains many conditions not usually termed “insanity”\r\n(such as, e.g., feeblemindedness, epilepsy, alcoholism, sundry somatic\r\ndiseases, psychoneuroses), but that these conditions are presented for\r\npractical purposes in a certain seemingly arbitrary order. Without\r\nattempting to justify this selection of scope (not too wide for modern\r\npsychiatry, most would readily acknowledge), I shall draw out a little\r\nfurther what I consider to be the virtues of the order selected. In\r\nthe first place, all will concede, _some_ order of consideration of\r\ncollected data is a prime necessity to the tyro. Without an order of\r\nconsideration the diagnostic tyro is but too apt to find in the best\r\ntextbooks of psychiatry (even more easily the better the textbook)\r\nall he needs to prove that the case in hand is--almost anything he\r\nselects to make his case conform to! And how much more dangerous this\r\ndebating-society method of diagnosis (by choice of a side and matching\r\na textbook type) may become in the fluid and elastic conditions\r\nof psychopathic hospital practice, can readily be observed by one\r\nwho contemplates the _formes frustes_ and entity-sketches that the\r\n“incipient, acute, and curable” group of cases presents.\r\n\r\n                                CHART 1\r\n\r\n                 PRACTICAL GROUPING OF MENTAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n    The order adopted for these groups (which roughly correspond\r\n    to botanical or zoological orders) is a pragmatic order for\r\n    successive exclusion on the basis of available tests, criteria,\r\n    or information: the actual diagnosis is a product of still\r\n    further differentiation within the several groups.\r\n\r\n    The case-histories of this book will show that\r\n\r\n    (_a_) most shell-shock is in group X, Psychoneuroses,\r\n\r\n    (_b_) the diagnostic delimitation problem is chiefly against I.\r\n    Syphilopsychoses, III. Epileptoses, VI. Somatopsychoses,\r\n\r\n    (_c_) the finer differentiation problem is between X.\r\n    Psychoneuroses and V. Encephalopsychoses.

Other Forms of Psychopathia      PSYCHOPATHOSES\r\n\r\nNo conclusions are intended to be drawn in these introductory pages.\r\nSuch conclusions as are risked are placed in the Epicrisis (see\r\nSection E). But so much can be said: If we are ever to surround the\r\nproblem of Shell-shock (_intra bellum_ or _post bellum_), we must\r\napproach it with no artificial and _à priori_ limitations of its scope.\r\nWe must not even agree beforehand that Shell-shock is nothing but\r\npsychoneurosis: that would be a deductive decision unworthy of modern\r\nscience. In the collection of these cases, I have tried to place the\r\ntopic upon the broadest clinical base. Samples of virtually every sort\r\nof mental disease and of several sorts of nervous disease have been\r\nlaid down, some obviously not instances of Shell-shock, some mixed with\r\nclinical phenomena of Shell-shock, others hard to tell offhand from\r\nShell-shock--the whole on the basis that we shall earliest learn what\r\nShell-shock, the pathological event, is by studying what it is not. As\r\nthe sequel may show, we are perhaps not entitled to regard Shell-shock,\r\nthe pathological event, as always associated with shell-shock, the\r\nphysical event. We shall, therefore, find in Section A (see tables on\r\npages 6 and 7).\r\n\r\n(1) Cases without either physical shell-shock, or pathological\r\nShell-shock--psychoses of various kinds incidental in the war (--+).\r\n\r\n(2) Cases with physical shell-shock but without pathological\r\nShell-shock--psychoses of various kinds seemingly liberated by,\r\naggravated by, or accelerated by the physical factor of shell-shock\r\n(+-+).\r\n\r\n(3) Cases without physical shell-shock but with both symptoms of\r\npathological Shell-shock as well as of other psychosis (-++).\r\n\r\n(4) Cases with physical shell-shock, with clinical phenomena of\r\nShell-shock, as well as of other psychosis (+++).\r\n\r\nAt the end of Section A, accordingly, we shall be left with two more\r\nformulae for discussion in Sections B, C, and D, viz:\r\n\r\n(5) Cases without physical shell-shock but with symptoms of\r\npathological Shell-shock (-+-).\r\n\r\n(6) Cases with physical shell-shock and pathological Shell-shock (++-).\r\n\r\nThe data of Section A will solidly prove that Shell-shock, however\r\npicturesque the term for laymen or in the _argot_ of the clinic, is\r\nmedically most intriguing. As we cannot get rid of the term (even by\r\nsuppressing it in parentheses or by condemning it to the limbo of the\r\n_so-called_), we must make the best of it by calling Shell-shock just\r\nthe ore in the clinical mine. To say the least, the _term_ is harmless:\r\nit merely stimulates the lay hearer to questions. These questions he\r\nmust ask of the expert. But every time that the expert suavely states\r\nthat Shell-shock is nothing but psychoneurosis, that expert runs the\r\nrisk of hurting some patient who may or not have a psychoneurosis but\r\nhas been _called_ psychoneurotic. All the while, of course, the suave\r\nexpert is perfectly right--_statistically_. In fine, the man you have\r\ncalled a victim of Shell-shock is probably a victim of psychoneurosis,\r\n_but only probably_!\r\n\r\nSection A shows how he may--not probably, but possibly--be a victim of\r\nsay ten other things. But it is not that he has an even chance of being\r\none of these ten other things. As the reader watches the procession\r\nof cases in Section A, he will perceive that, amongst the ten major\r\ngroups there studied, some have far greater diagnostic likelihood than\r\nothers. Thus, syphilis, epilepsy, and somatic diseases will in the\r\nsequel prove more dangerous to our success as diagnosticians than, e.\r\ng., feeblemindedness or even perhaps alcoholism. But now let us look at\r\nthese cases systematically, just as if we dealt with so many cases of\r\nRailway-spine or any other “incipient, acute, and curable” cases.\r\n\r\n                                CHART 2\r\n\r\n                        PSYCHOPATHIA MARTIALIS\r\n\r\n              ⎧‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎫\r\n                                               ⎧‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎫\r\n    SHELL-SHOCK              SHELL-SHOCK          PSYCHOSIS\r\n    (THE PHYSICAL FACTOR)  (NEUROTIC SYMPTOMS)  (SYMPTOMS NON-NEUROTIC)\r\n\r\n    ABSENT                     ABSENT             INCIDENTAL\r\n\r\n    PRESENT                    ABSENT             LIBERATED,\r\n                                                  AGGRAVATED,\r\n                                                  ACCELERATED\r\n                                                  PSYCHOSES\r\n\r\n    ABSENT                COMBINED NEUROSES\r\n                            AND PSYCHOSES\r\n                          [2](FORMULA -++)\r\n\r\n    PRESENT               COMBINED NEUROSES\r\n                            AND PSYCHOSES\r\n                            (FORMULA +++)\r\n\r\n    ABSENT                   NEUROSES              ABSENT\r\n                         (QUASI SHELL-SHOCK)\r\n\r\n    PRESENT                  NEUROSES              ABSENT\r\n                         (TRUE SHELL-SHOCK)\r\n\r\n    [2] For formulae see Chart 3 on opposite page.\r\n\r\n                                CHART 3\r\n\r\n                        PSYCHOPATHIA MARTIALIS\r\n\r\n                               FORMULAE\r\n\r\n                           ⎧‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎫\r\n                                                          ⎧‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾⎫\r\n    S, N, P[3] = SHELL-SHOCK       SHELL-SHOCK              PSYCHOSIS\r\n               (THE PHYSICAL[4]   (NEUROTIC SYMPTOMS)    (NON-NEUROTIC\r\n               FACTOR) PRESENT      PRESENT             SYMPTOMS) PRESENT\r\n\r\n      P =             -                 -                       +\r\n\r\n     SP =             +                 -                       +\r\n\r\n     NP =             -                 +                       +\r\n\r\n    SNP =             +                 +                       +\r\n\r\n      N =             -                 +                       -\r\n\r\n     SN =             +                 +                       -\r\n\r\n    [3] In the literal formulae, S = Shell-shock, N = Neurosis, P =\r\n    Psychosis.\r\n\r\n    [4] These plus-or-minus formulae are not intended to imply\r\n    that the physical factor, where present (+), must have worked\r\n    a physical effect upon the nervous system: the effects of the\r\n    physical factor might be wholly emotional or otherwise psychic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. SYPHILOPSYCHOSES (SYPHILITIC GROUP)\r\n\r\n\r\nAn officer of high rank deserts his command in a crisis: alienists’\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n=Case 1.= (BRIAND, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nM. X. was an officer ranking high in the French army, having military\r\nduties of a critical nature and of great importance (social reasons\r\nforbid Briand’s giving informatory details). Suffice it to say that he\r\nwas brought before court-martial for abandoning his post at the very\r\nmoment when his presence was most urgently required. He turned tail,\r\nwithout taking the most elementary military precautions.\r\n\r\nM. X. was passed up to alienists. He was not a case of Shell-shock\r\nunless of the anticipatory sort. He was somatically run-down and of\r\nlowered morale and now 65 years of age. The campaign had been fatiguing.\r\n\r\nThe alienists decided that the officer had not been responsible for\r\nhis non-military acts. He had been, they found, in a state of mental\r\nconfusion at the time of desertion, such that amnesia for his duties\r\nand heedlessness of consequences had allowed him to leave the front\r\nwithout looking behind him or securing substitution. This state of\r\nmental confusion had been preceded by overwork and several nights of\r\ninsomnia.\r\n\r\nMoreover he was palpably arteriosclerotic. Blood pressure was high. The\r\nhistory was one of slight shocks and a mild hemiplegia. The confusion\r\nat the front was only the most recent of a series of transitory attacks\r\nof confusion. At the time of examination this high officer was actually\r\nin a state of mild dementia.\r\n\r\nM. X. was an old colonial man, malarial, and had been a victim of\r\nsyphilis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA naval officer sees hundreds of submarines: General paresis.\r\n\r\n=Case 2.= (CARLILL, FILDES, and BAKER, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA naval officer, 36, during August, 1916, asserted that he could see\r\nhundreds of submarines. At one time he imagined that he was receiving\r\ntrunk calls in the middle of the ocean. He was admitted to Haslar, and\r\nthe Wassermann reaction of the serum was found strongly positive. The\r\nspinal fluid was not at this time examined. The officer recovered to\r\nsome extent, was given no special treatment, and was sent on leave.\r\n\r\nHe came under observation again in October, 1916, having become very\r\nstrange in his manner, on one occasion passing water into the coal box,\r\nand talked about impending electrocution. His ankle-jerks were found\r\nsluggish and there was a patch of blunting to pin pricks. The diagnosis\r\nof general paresis was made. The spinal fluid was afterward examined\r\nand found to be negative to the Wassermann reaction but contained 15\r\nlymphocytes per cubic mm.\r\n\r\nThree full doses of Kharsivan freed him from delusions and left him\r\napparently absolutely sane. It was recommended that he should be kept\r\nat Haslar to continue treatment. However, he had been certified insane\r\nand was therefore sent to Yarmouth, from which he was discharged in\r\nFebruary, 1917, having been in good mental health throughout his stay\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n_Re_ syphilis and general paresis of military officers, as in Cases 1\r\nand 2, Russo-Japanese experience was already at hand. Autokratow saw\r\nparetic Russian officers sent to the front in early but still obvious\r\nphases of disease. These paretics and various arteriosclerotics,\r\nAutokratow saw back in Russia in the course of a few months.\r\n\r\n_Re_ naval cases, see also Case 5 (Beaton). Beaton thinks that\r\nmonotonous ship duty, alternating with critical stress of service,\r\nbears on morale and liberates mental disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurosyphilis may be aggravated or accelerated under war conditions.\r\n\r\n=Case 3.= (WEYGANDT, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA German, long alcoholic and thought to be weakminded, volunteered, but\r\nshortly had to be released from service. He began to be forgetful and\r\nobstinate, cried, and even appeared to be subject to hallucinations.\r\nThe pupils were unequal and sluggish. The uvula hung to the right.\r\nThe left knee-jerk was lively, right weak. Fine tremors of hands.\r\nHypalgesia of backs of hands. Stumbling speech. Attention poor.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that he had been infected with syphilis in 1881 and in 1903\r\nhad had an ulcer of the left leg.\r\n\r\nThe military commission denied that his service had brought about the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Case 4.= (HURST, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn English colonel thought himself perfectly fit when he went out with\r\nthe original Expeditionary Force. He had had leg pains, regarded as\r\ndue to rheumatism or neuritis. He was invalided home after exhaustion\r\non the great retreat. He was now found to be suffering from a severe\r\ntabes. He improved greatly under rest and antisyphilitic treatment. He\r\nhas now returned to duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Case 5.= (BEATON, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn apparently healthy man, serving on an English battle-ship, severed\r\na tendon in a finger. The injury was regarded as minor. The tendon was\r\nsutured and the wound healed. During the man’s convalescence he was\r\naccidentally discovered to have an Argyll-Robertson pupil and some\r\nexcess reflexes. Neurosyphilis had probably antedated the accident. But\r\nfrom the moment of this trivial injury, the disease advanced rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverwork in service; several months exacting work well performed:\r\nGeneral paresis.\r\n\r\n=Case 6.= (BOUCHEROT, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant of Territorials, aged 41 (heredity good, anal fistula at\r\n30, with ulceration of penis of an unknown nature at the same period).\r\nIn 1907 when off service and married, his wife gave birth to a child;\r\nno miscarriages. Had been a good soldier in service before the war. The\r\nlieutenant was called to the colors August 2, 1914, and was detached\r\nfor special duty, for the performance of which he was much praised by\r\nthe commanding officers. The work, however, was too much for him and\r\non April 1 he had to be evacuated to the hospital with a ticket saying\r\n“Nervous depression following overwork in service.” On April 14 he\r\nseemed well enough for a convalescent camp, but, apparently through\r\nred tape, was sent to a hospital at Orléans. On June 23 he had to be\r\nevacuated to the Fleury annex. His eyes were dull and features flaccid;\r\nhis whole manner suggested fatigue. His pupils were myotic, tongue\r\ntremulous, speech slow and stumbling. Knee-jerks were exaggerated and\r\ngait difficult, the right leg dragging. Headaches. He could not perform\r\nthe slightest intellectual work and was the victim of retrograde and\r\nanterograde amnesia. He was aware of the decline of his mental power\r\nand was fain to struggle against it, becoming restless and sad. The\r\ngaps in his memory grew deeper, he became more and more impulsive,\r\neven violent, and had spells of excitement. Dizziness and palpitation\r\ndeveloped. Sometimes there were auditory and visual hallucinations of\r\nsuch intense character that he tried feebly to commit suicide with a\r\npenknife. He fell into semicoma, and then had a number of apoplectiform\r\nattacks. W. R. +\r\n\r\nApparently the moral and physical situation of the lieutenant was\r\nabsolutely normal when the campaign began and, as he fulfilled detail\r\nduties with absolute correctness for a number of months, Boucherot\r\nargues that here is an instance of general paresis _declanché_ by\r\noverwork.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyphilis contracted before enlistment. Neurosyphilis aggravated by\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n=Case 7.= (TODD, personal communication, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA laboring man, 42, who always strenuously denied syphilitic infection,\r\nproceeded to France eight months after enlistment. He had not been\r\nin France three weeks when he dropped unconscious. He regained\r\nconsciousness, but remained stupid, dull in expression, and with memory\r\nimpaired. His speech was also impaired. There was dizziness and a\r\nright-sided hemiplegia.\r\n\r\nHe was confined to bed four months and was then “boarded” for discharge.\r\n\r\nPhysically, his heart was slightly enlarged both right and left; sounds\r\nirregular; extra systoles; aortic systolic murmur transmitted to neck;\r\nblood pressure 140:40. Precordial pain, dyspnoea.\r\n\r\nNeurologically, there was a partial spastic paralysis of the right\r\nthigh which could be abducted, could be flexed to 120°, and showed\r\nsome power in the quadriceps. There was also a spastic paralysis of\r\nthe right arm, but the shoulder girdle movements were not impaired.\r\nThere was a slight weakness on the right side of the face. There was no\r\nanesthesia anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe deep reflexes were increased on the right side, Babinski on right,\r\nflexor contractures of right hand, extensor contractures of right\r\nleg, abdominal and epigastric reflexes absent, pupils active, tongue\r\nprotruded in straight line.\r\n\r\nFluid: slight increase in protein. W. R. + + +\r\n\r\nThe Board of Pension Commissioners ruled that the condition had been\r\naggravated _by_ service (not “_on_ service”).\r\n\r\n_Re_ general paresis, Fearnsides suggested at the Section of Neurology\r\nin the Royal Society of Medicine early in 1916, that in all cases of\r\nsuspected Shell-shock the Wassermann reaction of the serum should be\r\ndetermined, and went on to say that cases of so-called Shell-shock with\r\npositive W. R. often improve rapidly with antisyphilitic remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuration of neurosyphilitic process important _re_ compensation.\r\n\r\n=Case 8.= (FARRAR, personal communication, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA Canadian of 36 enlisted in 1915, served in England, and was returned\r\nto Canada in February, 1917, clearly suffering from some form of\r\nneurosyphilis (W. R. positive in serum and fluid, globulin, pleocytosis\r\n108).\r\n\r\nThere is no record of any disability or symptom of nervous or mental\r\ndisease at enlistment. The first symptoms were noted by the patient in\r\nMay, 1916, six months or more after enlistment. The case was reviewed\r\nat a Canadian Special Hospital, October 11, 1916, by a board which\r\nreported:\r\n\r\n“The condition could only come from syphilitic infection of three\r\nyears’ standing” (a decision bearing on compensation); but the general\r\ndiagnosis remained:\r\n\r\n“Cerebrospinal lues, =aggravated by service=.”\r\n\r\nThe picture which the medical board regarded as of at least three\r\nyears’ standing was as follows:\r\n\r\nHistory of incontinence, shooting pains, attacks of syncope, general\r\nweakness, facial tremor, exaggerated knee-jerks, pupils react with\r\nsmall excursion. Speech and writing disorder, perception dull, lapses\r\nof attention, memory defect, defective insight into nature of disorder,\r\nemotional apathy.\r\n\r\n    1. Was the conclusion “aggravated by service” sound? On\r\n    humanitarian grounds the victim is naturally conceded the\r\n    benefit of the doubt. But it is questionable how scientifically\r\n    sound the conclusion really was.\r\n\r\n    2. Could the condition come only from syphilitic infection of\r\n    at least three years’ standing? Hardly any single symptom in\r\n    this case need be of so long a standing; yet the combination\r\n    of symptoms seems by very weight of numbers to justify the\r\n    conclusion of the medical board.\r\n\r\nFarrar’s case and thirteen others of “Neurosyphilis and the War” were\r\nincluded in a general work on Neurosyphilis (Case History Series,\r\n1917, Southard and Solomon). For military syphilis in general, see\r\nThibierge’s _Syphilis dans l’Armée_ (also in translation).\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral paresis lighted up by the stress of military service without\r\ninjury or disease?\r\n\r\n=Case 9.= (MARIE, CHATELIN, PATRIKIOS, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nIn apparently good health a French soldier repaired to the colors, in\r\nAugust, 1914, being then 23 years old.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, August, 1916, symptoms appeared: speech disorder\r\nwith stammering, change of character (had become easily excitable),\r\nstumbling gait. He became more and more preoccupied with his own\r\naffairs, grew worse, and was sent to hospital in October, 1916.\r\n\r\nHe was then foolish and overhappy, especially when interviewed.\r\nThere was marked rapid tremor of face and tongue. Speech hesitant,\r\nmonotonous, and stammering to the point of unintelligibility. His\r\nmemory, at first preserved, became impaired so that half of a test\r\nphrase was forgotten. Simple addition was impossible and fantastic sums\r\nwould be given instead of right answers. Handwriting tremulous, letters\r\noften missed, others irregular, unequal, and misshapen.\r\n\r\nExcitable from onset, the patient now became at times suddenly violent,\r\nstriking his wife without provocation. After visit at home, he would\r\nforget to return to hospital. Often he would leave hospital without\r\npermission (of course the more surprising in a disciplined soldier). No\r\ndelusions.\r\n\r\nSerum and fluid W. R. positive; albumin; lymphocytosis.\r\n\r\nNeurological examination: Unequal pupils, slight right-side mydriasis,\r\npupils stiff to light, weakly responsive in accommodation, reflexes\r\nlively, fingers tremulous on extension of arms.\r\n\r\nThe patient had, December 5, 1916, an epileptiform attack with head\r\nrotation, limb-contractions and clonic movements. Should this soldier\r\nrecover for disability obtained in service? Marie was inclined to\r\nthink military service in part responsible for the development of\r\nthe paresis. Laignel-Lavastine thought so also, but that the amount\r\nassigned should be 5%-10% of the maximum assignable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYPHILITIC ROOT-SCIATICA (lumbosacral radiculitis) in a fireworks man\r\nwith a French artillery regiment.\r\n\r\n=Case 10.= (LONG (DEJERINE’S clinic), February, 1916.)\r\n\r\nNo direct relation of this example of root-sciatica to the war is\r\nclaimed nor was there a question of financial reparation.\r\n\r\nThere was no prior injury. At the end of March, 1915, the workman was\r\ntaken with acute pains in lumbar region and thighs, and with urgent but\r\nretarded micturition.\r\n\r\nUnfit for work, he remained, however, five months with the regiment,\r\nand was then retired for two months to a hospital behind the lines.\r\nHe reached the Salpêtrière October 12, 1915, with “double sciatica,\r\nintractable.”\r\n\r\nThere was no demonstrable paralysis but the legs seemed to have “melted\r\naway,” _fondu_, as the patient said. Pains were spontaneously felt in\r\nthe lumbar plexus and sciatic nerve regions, not passing, however,\r\nbeyond the thighs. These pains were more intense with movements of\r\nlegs; but coughing did not intensify the pains. Neuralgic points could\r\nbe demonstrated by the finger in lumbar and gluteal regions and above\r\nand below the iliac crests (corresponding with rami of first lumbar\r\nnerves). The inguinal region was involved and the painful zone reached\r\nthe sciatic notch and the upper part of the posterior surface of the\r\nthigh.\r\n\r\nThe sensory disorder had another distribution, objectively tested. The\r\nsacral and perineal regions were free. Anesthesia of inner surfaces of\r\nthighs, hypesthesia of the anterior surfaces of thighs and lower legs.\r\nThe anesthesia grew more and more marked lower down and was maximal in\r\nthe feet, which were practically insensible to all tests, including\r\nthose for bone sensation. There was a longitudinal strip of skin of\r\nlower leg which retained sensation.\r\n\r\nPosition sense of toes, except great toes, was poor. There was a\r\nslight ataxia attributable to the sensory disorder--reflexes of upper\r\nextremities, abdominal, and cremasteric preserved, knee-jerks, Achilles\r\nand plantar reactions absent.\r\n\r\nThe vesical sphincter shortly regained its function, though its\r\ndisorder had been an initial symptom. Pupils normal.\r\n\r\nThe “sciatica” here affects the lumbosacral plexus.\r\n\r\nAs to the syphilitic nature of this affection, there had been at\r\neighteen (22 years before) a colorless small induration of the penis,\r\nlasting about three weeks. There was now evident a small oval pigmented\r\nscar. The patient had married at 20 and had had three healthy children.\r\n\r\nThe lumbar puncture fluid yielded pleocytosis (120 per cmm.). Mercurial\r\ntreatment was instituted.\r\n\r\nThe treatment has not reduced the pains. Long thinks it was undertaken\r\ntoo long (six months) after onset. The warning for early diagnosis is\r\nmanifest. There was somehow a delay under the medical conditions of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\n_Re_ syphilis in munition-workers Thibierge has much to say of French\r\nconditions. Throughout his work on syphilis in the army, he stresses\r\nthe large number of venereal cases in men mobilized for munition-work.\r\nMedical inspections ought, according to Thibierge, imperatively to be\r\nmade in the munition-works and upon all mobilized workmen, whether\r\nFrench or belonging to the Colonial contingents. These men are under\r\nmilitary control in France, but they have more opportunities than the\r\nsoldiers for contracting and disseminating syphilis. They are, in point\r\nof fact, very often infected and in a higher proportion than are the\r\nsoldiers at the front. The munition-workers should also be obliged to\r\nreport their infections to the physician, whether or no they are under\r\ntreatment by military or by private physicians.\r\n\r\nThibierge devotes a chapter to syphilis as a national danger. Not\r\nonly do available statistics prove that there is more syphilis in\r\nthe population since the outbreak of war, but the number of married\r\nwomen going to special hospitals for syphilis is abnormally high and\r\nentirely out of proportion to the number of married women resorting\r\nto these clinics in peace times. A certain number are contaminated\r\nby their husbands on leave. Thibierge calls attention to the fact of\r\nthe extraordinary frequency of syphilis in young men (two or three,\r\nsixteen to eighteen years of age, at Saint-Louis Hospital at each\r\nconsultation).\r\n\r\n\r\nA disciplinary case: Syphilitic?\r\n\r\n=Case 11.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nReports varied about a certain German soldier who came up for\r\ndiscipline. Inferiors thought he was harsh and tricky. A lieutenant\r\ndeclared that the man always wanted to have proper respect paid to him,\r\nand that he was unduly excited by trifles. The man had become latterly\r\nvery nervous on account of battle strain and protracted shelling.\r\n\r\nJuly 28, 1915, the man, who had been drinking with comrades the night\r\nbefore, was excitedly talking to an officer concerning relief of a\r\nguard. The soldier stated, “As a sergeant on duty with a service record\r\nof 15 years, I think it is my affair.” The lieutenant replied, “So\r\nfar as I am concerned, the matter is settled.” The sergeant yelled,\r\n“As far as I am concerned, it is settled also. By the way, my name\r\nis _Mr._ Vice Sergeant …,” and with that the sergeant wrote down the\r\nlieutenant’s words and refused to obey the lieutenant’s order to\r\n“Stop writing.” The lieutenant drew his sword and said, “Take your\r\nhands down.” The sergeant replied, “Surely I am permitted to write.”\r\nLieutenant: “Subordination; don’t forget yourself, Vice Sergeant.…”\r\nThe sergeant jeered, “You forgot yourself anyhow;” whereupon the\r\nlieutenant: “Well, such a thing never happened to me before.” The\r\nsergeant, jeeringly, “Nor to me either. If I were not in undress I\r\nshould know what to do.” The lieutenant: “Vice Sergeant …, remain here.\r\nThis matter will be settled at once.” The sergeant: “It is _Mr._ Vice\r\nSergeant …,” whereupon he gave his notebook to a hornblower and said,\r\n“Write.” The lieutenant: “Stay.” The sergeant: “What, stay here. No,\r\nI’ll not stay,” and made off. The lieutenant called after him, “Put\r\non your service dress and see the captain.” He made ready but said,\r\n“This half-idiot gives an order like that to a sergeant with 15 years’\r\nrecord.”\r\n\r\nThe examination showed that the man had a hypalgesia. He complained of\r\nviolent headaches. He said that he had had syphilis 10 years before;\r\nthere were no bodily stigmata.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulations broken: General paresis.\r\n\r\n=Case 12.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA German 1st-lieutenant, on active service before the war, had left\r\nthe service because there was not enough for him to do in peace times.\r\nDuring his war service, he became drunk and had two soldiers bound to\r\na doorpost, with coats unbuttoned and without their caps--a process\r\nquite _verboten_. While in Königsberg, he reported himself ill, and\r\nfailed to go to a designated hospital. He was accordingly treated as\r\na deserter. He ran up bills with landlady and servant girls, saying\r\nthat he was going to receive money from his wife. Under hospital\r\nexamination, he said he was only a Baden man with a lively temperament.\r\nHe got angry at the phrase _test feeding_, refused food, got excited\r\nwhen asked to help in the care of other patients, and wrote a letter\r\nsaying, “If it is the idea to make me nervous by removing the air from\r\nme, by prescribing rest in bed--a punishment only suitable for a boy\r\nwho cannot keep himself neat--and such chicaneries, these philanthropic\r\nattempts are bound to fail on my robust peasant nerves. Of course I\r\nknow that money considerations make the stay of every paying patient\r\ndesirable, but I am really too good for that. [The expenses were being\r\nborne by the state.] I have openly stated what is being here done with\r\nme is foolery, and I stick to that phrase. The food, already poor\r\nenough, is no better, when the meat of a half-rotten cow comes twice to\r\nthe table.” This patient was, according to Kastan, a victim of general\r\nparesis.\r\n\r\n_Re_ general paresis and delinquency, Gilles de la Tourette long ago\r\nmaintained that there was a medicolegal period in paresis. Lépine in\r\nhis work on _Troubles Mentales de la Guerre_ speaks of the unexpected\r\nfrequency of general paresis in the army, and calls attention at the\r\noutset to the medicolegal period. The danger of overt delinquency\r\nis, in fact, greater under military than under civilian conditions\r\non account of the closer surveillance of the soldier. Desertion and\r\nthievery are the main forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfit for service: General paresis.\r\n\r\n=Case 13.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nKastan describes a non-commissioned officer, who came voluntarily\r\ninto the clinic. It seems that he had absented himself (?) from the\r\narmy in the suburbs of Königsberg, September 3, 1914. He was arrested\r\nOctober 7th. Once before he had been brought to Kastan’s clinic on the\r\nsuspicion of general paresis, but had been dismissed as non-paretic.\r\nBrought in again in a condition of marked fear, he declared that he had\r\nto fall behind his company while he was on the march on account of a\r\nfeeling of weakness. He had been taken to a hospital and then carried\r\nto the suburbs of Königsberg, examined, and found unfit for service.\r\n\r\nHe had in his 20th year become infected with syphilis, and had recently\r\nbecome forgetful, subject to fears, and easily excitable. He had been\r\nvery unhappily married with a woman who was hysterical and threatened\r\nto shoot and poison him. He lived in a condition of continual quarrels\r\nwith her. The symptoms that he felt on the march were numbness of the\r\nlegs and a rush of blood to the head. In the clinic, he was subject\r\nto much dreaming and raving about the war. There was excessive\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\n    1. As to the proper interpretation of this case, details\r\n    are lacking as to the physical and laboratory side. In\r\n    fact, it would appear that the suspicion of paresis at his\r\n    first reception in a clinic was dismissed without resort to\r\n    laboratory findings.\r\n\r\n    There are no neurological symptoms in the case clearly\r\n    suggestive of neurosyphilis, except perhaps the numbness of\r\n    the legs. The remainder of the picture appears to be entirely\r\n    psychic. Sensory and intellectual symptoms are missing unless\r\n    we count the war dreams and mania as intellectual. It appears\r\n    wiser to count these as emotional in the sense that they were\r\n    roused by emotion-laden memories. The fear, perspiration, and\r\n    feelings of head flush are perhaps to be best interpreted as\r\n    satellites about an emotional nucleus.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical chorea versus neurosyphilis.\r\n\r\n=Case 14.= (DE MASSARY and DU SONICH, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nThere were various complications in the case of a lieutenant (nervous\r\ntic in childhood; travel 23 to 30), who was at Antwerp during the\r\nperiod of mobilization. He was taken there by the Germans; was a\r\nprisoner in their hands for 55 days; and succeeded under great strain\r\nin escaping.\r\n\r\nHe then entered his regiment, and, passing the examinations, was\r\nmade an adjutant, and went to the front, March, 1915. He stayed ten\r\nmonths in the Verdun region, under heavy bombardment, and in June was\r\nbowled over and buried by a 210. He seemed to be fearless, getting no\r\nsensation from shell-bursts except a griping sensation in the bowels.\r\n\r\nHowever, his character had altered in the direction of irritability;\r\nand by the end of January, 1916, he had to be evacuated for the\r\nfirst time from the front, for general weakness, with the diagnoses:\r\nneurasthenia, neuralgia, dyspeptic troubles, great general fatigue,\r\nmarked depression. In fact, at Narbonne he was asked no questions\r\nfor several days on account of his obvious depression. He was given\r\nice-bags for violent headaches, complete rest in bed, cacodylate and\r\nsodium nucleinate. In two weeks he was up and about.\r\n\r\nAt this time appeared choreiform movements, which reached their maximum\r\nin two or three days, whereupon he was sent, March 4, 1916, to the\r\nneurological centre at Montpellier. Here W. R. positive! Neosalvarsan\r\non the second injection (0.45 and 0.60) yielded a strong reaction, with\r\nfever, delirium, vomiting, and then jaundice.\r\n\r\nAbout a month later, he was given twenty more intravenous injections,\r\nwhereupon the choreic movements now decreased, and July 15 he was given\r\nconvalescence for three months. October 15 he went back to his dépôt\r\ncured; and October 20, on request, went to the front. He was potted\r\nand under machine-gun fire at times during the next three months, but\r\nthe choreic movements did not reappear. January 1 he left the trenches\r\nas the division went into billets. January 8, suddenly, without\r\nany emotional cause, he began to “dance” again. Accordingly, he was\r\nevacuated for the second time, January 10, 1917, with the diagnosis:\r\nchoreic movements, especially on left; evacuate to special centre.\r\n\r\nAt Royallieu, a lumbar puncture showed a slight lymphocytosis.\r\nThe headache improved. He was evacuated January 24, 1917, to\r\nVal-de-Grâce, with a diagnosis: Recurrent chorea; first attack followed\r\ncommotio cerebri, nervous depression, inequality of pupils, various\r\npains, contracted in the army. Another W. R. was positive. Twelve\r\nintramuscular injections of oxygen cyanide were given, besides baths.\r\nHe was then sent to Issy-les-Moulineaux with a diagnosis of tic. He\r\nshowed choreiform movements affecting the legs alone. When sitting,\r\nlegs extended and flexed, the knees would abduct, then adduct;\r\nthe thighs flexed. When standing, flexor movements were produced\r\nalternately on the left and the right, the knee being raised high,\r\nsometimes striking the patient’s hand. In walking, the thigh and lower\r\nleg flexion was always out of proportion to the required step. There\r\nwas thus a sort of saltatory chorea limited to the legs. The reflexes\r\nso far as they could be tested were normal save that the left pupil\r\nwas fixed to light and accommodation; the right pupil was sluggish to\r\nlight but accommodated normally. Leucoplakia of the cheeks; nocturnal\r\nheadaches; and pains resembling lightning pains in arms and legs.\r\nLumbar puncture, March 26, showed blood-stained fluid, and the puncture\r\nwas followed by headache, vomiting, and slow pulse. The fluid showed a\r\nslight lymphocytosis; W. R. negative.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that a diagnosis limiting itself to the leg trouble would\r\nprobably content itself with “hysterical chorea.” The lieutenant said\r\nthat when he saw people “dance” he did have a tendency to imitate\r\nthem; and when he was cured of that, he did not want to go to Lamalou\r\nbecause he would see the ataxic patients there and might fall back\r\ninto his “dancing.” However, in view of the pupillary inequality, the\r\nlymphocytosis, the leucoplakia, the W. R., and the initial neurasthenia\r\nand depression found in the very first hospital in which he was\r\nexamined, we probably should be entitled to consider that general\r\nparesis played a part in the chorea.\r\n\r\n\r\nShrapnel fragment driven through skull: General paresis.\r\n\r\n=Case 15.= (HURST, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private, 31, was wounded December 7, 1916, by a shrapnel fragment\r\nwhich entered the skull above the left ear and lodged in the brain,\r\nan inch above and 2½ inches below the middle of the right orbital\r\nmargin. At Netley, December 30, he proved to show a complete internal\r\nand external left sided ophthalmoplegia, with the exception of the\r\nexternal rectus. On the right side, there was a complete paralysis of\r\nthe superior rectus and a partial paralysis of the inferior rectus and\r\nlevator palpebrae superioris. There was a paresis of the left side of\r\nthe face. The right plantar reflex was said to have been extensor at\r\nthe clearing station, but at Netley it and the other reflexes proved\r\nto be normal, as were the optic. The patient was stuporous and had\r\nincontinence of urine and feces for two days. Shortly after admission,\r\nslurring of speech with a long latent period occurred. It was clear\r\nthat the shrapnel fragment must have passed far above the crus, and\r\nit was not plain how isolated lesions of the third and seventh nerve\r\nnuclei could have been brought about without injury of the long tracts\r\nof the crus.\r\n\r\nThe Wassermann reaction of the serum was negative, but that of the\r\nspinal fluid was positive. Iodide and mercury secured considerable\r\nimprovement in the mental condition and some diminution in the\r\nparalysis. The patient is now extremely pleased with himself and has a\r\nspeech suggestive of paresis.\r\n\r\n\r\nHead trauma: Shell-shock effects, over in a few months.\r\nManic-depressive (?) attack more than two years later. X-ray evidence\r\nsuggesting brain lesion. Serum Wassermann reaction positive.\r\n\r\n=Case 16.= (BABONNEIX and DAVID, June, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA bullet glancing from his gun barrel November 28, 1914, wounded a\r\nman in the head, whereupon he lost consciousness and was carried to a\r\nhospital and trephined. On coming to, he found that he could not hear\r\nand felt pains; but the latter disappeared in a few months. He was\r\ngiven sedentary employment and did his work properly until February,\r\n1917, when he suddenly became sad, wept, slept poorly, stopped eating,\r\nhad an absent air, and began to complain of his head. He passed whole\r\ndays without moving, in a sort of stupor, which was then followed by a\r\nhypomaniacal agitation in which he walked furiously up and down in the\r\nroom and threw objects about.\r\n\r\nHe was found subject to a generalized tremor and he was distinctly\r\nweaker on the right side. The tendon reflexes were excessive. The\r\nbony sensibility, as well as the pain and temperature sense, and\r\nthe position and stereognostic senses were completely abolished on\r\nthe right side. The scar lay on the left side. It was deep and very\r\nsensitive to pressure, so that if it was touched ever so slightly\r\nthe patient began to weep. X-ray indicated loss of substance in the\r\nposterior part of the left parietal region. Remains of the projectile\r\nwere found subcutaneously in the right supraorbital region. The W. R.\r\nof the serum was positive. There was no lymphocytosis in the spinal\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nInterpretation of this case is manifestly difficult. Four possibilities\r\nexist: Syphilis, manic depressive psychosis, traumatic brain disease,\r\nand functional shock effects. More than two years had passed between\r\nthe trauma and the change of character.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkull trauma in a syphilitic.\r\n\r\n=Case 17.= (BABONNEIX and DAVID, June, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 31, sustained fracture of the occiput from shell-burst,\r\nand thereafter showed confusion and total loss of memory. Operation\r\nNovember 11 withdrew bony fragments and clots, whereupon the man\r\nreturned practically to normal. He developed, however, a few seizures,\r\nin which he struggled, fell, and lost consciousness, afterward\r\nsuffering from headache. The tendon reflexes were increased. The\r\noccipital cicatrix was a little depressed and slightly painful on\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture showed a very slight lymphocytosis (5 to 6 cells),\r\npractically negative globulin reaction, and a low albumin titer. There\r\nwere no signs of syphilis in the eyes. The W. R. in the serum was\r\nstrongly positive. Very possibly the traumatic phenomena in this case\r\ncan be safely disengaged from the syphilitic phenomena.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the mechanism by which trauma evokes or accelerates the course of\r\nneurosyphilis, it is probable that most neuropathologists believe that\r\nthe _commotio cerebri_ causes sundry chemical or physical effects in\r\nthe nerve tissues such that spirochetes are moved into new and more\r\ndangerous places, or such that more appropriate food is supplied to the\r\norganisms, which then begin to multiply. Whether the organisms live in\r\na kind of symbiosis in the tissues under ordinary circumstances in the\r\npre-paretic period of the development of neurosyphilis, is unknown.\r\nPossibly fat embolism should be added to the list of possible causes\r\nof the hastening of the neurosyphilitic process. Fat embolism in the\r\nbrain has been shown by various authors to be accompanied by minute\r\nhemorrhages, in the midst of which by proper stains the fat embolism\r\ncan be made out.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-wound in battle: General paresis.\r\n\r\n=Case 18.= (BOUCHEROT, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in the Territorial Infantry, 42, a gardener who went to\r\ntaverns, as he said, “like everybody else,” a widower with two\r\nchildren, a good worker though irascible, had had syphilis as a youth.\r\nHe was called to the colors at the outbreak of the war and got on well\r\ndespite tremendous strain. March 9, 1915, he was in a bayonet charge\r\nwith his regiment and was bowled over by a shell of which a fragment\r\nwounded him above the knee and several fragments in the thorax. All\r\nthese fragments were extracted at a temporary hospital, March 11.\r\nThe man now became strange, refused to obey orders and did a number\r\nof peculiar things so that he was sent to Orléans temporary hospital\r\nwhence he was evacuated to Fleury Asylum, March 19. He refused to give\r\nup his things because he was the master. He did not want to go to bed\r\nand wanted to keep on walking constantly. He was without sense of\r\nshame, satisfied with himself, grandiose as to his millions in bank and\r\nthe thirty-six decorations he believed had been awarded him. He mistook\r\nthe identity of the landscape and of the people about him.\r\n\r\nTongue tremulous; pupils unequal; knee-jerks exaggerated; dysarthria;\r\ngaps in memory. In May occurred a number of violent reactions.\r\n\r\nIn June, however, there was a remission; the ideas of grandeur\r\ndisappeared first, then the tremors and reflex disorder and finally the\r\nspeech disorder. There was a slight seizure at this point and the man\r\nsaid he had had another such just before he came to the army. July 20\r\nhe was invalided out much improved.\r\n\r\nIn this case of general paresis there is, besides the syphilis, also\r\nalcoholism to consider, so that it is not entirely plain that the\r\nexertions of campaign liberated the paresis.\r\n\r\n_Re_ wounds and paresis, see also Case 5 (Beaton), in which\r\nneurosyphilis advanced rapidly from the time of a trivial injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion: Syphilitic ocular palsy.\r\n\r\n=Case 19.= (SCHUSTER, November, 1915.)\r\n\r\nSchuster notes briefly a curious result of the explosion of a shell,\r\nwhich caused the patient in question to lose consciousness. Shortly\r\nafter the explosion, the patient came to his senses again, but a\r\nsurprising paresis of the eye muscles had developed. This paresis\r\nlooked precisely like a syphilitic paresis clinically.\r\n\r\nExamination of the blood serum yielded a strongly positive Wassermann\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schuster, the explosion of the shell had brought about\r\nhemorrhage in vessels supplying the region of the eye muscle nerves or\r\nnuclei. The reason for the selection of these vessels for rupture due\r\nto shell explosion is, according to Schuster, that the vessels were\r\nprobably already syphilitically diseased.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hemorrhages in the neighborhood of the oculomotor nuclei, the\r\nphenomena of polioencephalitis may be recalled. In that disease, the\r\npredisposition to hemorrhage is presumed to be alcoholic, as the cases\r\nof ophthalmoplegia of this group almost always appear in alcoholics.\r\nHowever, the first case of hemorrhagic superior polioencephalitis was a\r\nnon-alcoholic one of Gayet (1875), in which the symptoms followed three\r\ndays after a boiler explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA tabetic lieutenant “shell-shocked” into paresis?\r\n\r\n=Case 20.= (DONATH, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn apparently competent German professor in an intermediate school,\r\na lieutenant of infantry reserves, 33 years old, on the 17th August,\r\n1914, was stunned for a while by the shock of a cannon-firing 25 feet\r\naway. Urination became difficult. Headaches and limb pains ensued, with\r\nparalysis of fingers, gastric troubles, forgetfulness, especially for\r\nnames, insomnia, and general scattering of mental faculties.\r\n\r\nNeurologically, the pupils were irregular, left larger than right;\r\nArgyll-Robertson reaction. Right knee-jerk livelier than left. Achilles\r\nreactions absent. Slow and dissociated pain reactions in feet, lower\r\nthighs and lower quarter of upper thighs, with hypalgesia or analgesia.\r\nStation good; gait steady. Mentally depressed, slow of thought. Speech\r\npoor and of indistinct construction (mild dementia). Calculation\r\nability poor. No pleasure in work.\r\n\r\nWassermann reaction of serum weakly positive.\r\n\r\nIt seems that for a year the patient had been subject to spells of\r\nanger. He was irritated by his wife who had been nervous since an\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n_On the occasion of the earthquake_, 1911, the patient himself had had\r\na spell of _difficulty with urination_. The spell had lasted two or\r\nthree months. The patient had had a chancre in 1902, “cured” in four or\r\nfive weeks with xeroform. In 1908, when about to marry, he had had six\r\nmercurial inunctions.\r\n\r\n_Re_ tabes, Lépine shows that tabetics are numerous. They are numerous\r\namong officers and also in the auxiliary service, in which latter\r\ntabetics are maintained on desk duty. Perhaps they had been admitted\r\nto such work as unable to march or fight, on the basis of having had\r\nso-called “rheumatism.”\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion may precipitate neurosyphilis in the form of tabes\r\ndorsalis.\r\n\r\n=Case 21.= (LOGRE, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn artilleryman, 38, had a large calibre shell explode very near\r\nhim and afterward could not hear the whistle of a shell without\r\nfalling down in a generalized tremor, sweating profusely, urinating\r\ninvoluntarily, in a mental state approaching stupidity. Here was a case\r\nthat might be regarded as one of morbid cowardice in a psychopath,\r\nfollowing violent emotion.\r\n\r\nThe artilleryman proved to be a victim of tabes and of general paresis.\r\nThe incontinence of urine under the influence of emotion was nothing\r\nbut an effect of tabetic sphincter disorder. The crisis of cowardice\r\nproved nothing but an initial symptom of general paresis.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion; burial: Tabes dorsalis incipiens.\r\n\r\n=Case 22.= (DUCO and BLUM, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA French soldier was buried by effects of shell explosion September 8,\r\n1914. He sustained no wound or fracture.\r\n\r\nIncontinence of urine developed. Anesthesia of penis and scrotum.\r\nReflexes absent; pupils sluggish. Wassermann reactions suspicious.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis =tabes dorsalis incipiens= was made (hematomyelia of\r\nconus terminalis eliminated).\r\n\r\nThe patient was estimated to be “40% incapacitated,” according to the\r\nFrench “_échelle de gravité_” of conditions. A full pension would not\r\nbe justified in the opinion of the French authors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELL-SHOCK PSEUDOTABES (non-syphilitic, serum W. R. positive).\r\nImprovement.\r\n\r\n=Case 23.= (PITRES and MARCHAND, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nInnkeeper B., 36, a shell-shock and burial victim June 20, 1915, was\r\nlooked on by a number of physicians as a case of genuine tabes.\r\n\r\nEven eight months after the episode, he still showed (when observed\r\nby Pitres and Marchand, February 3, 1916) absence of knee-jerks and\r\nAchilles jerks, a slight swaying in the Romberg position, pupils\r\nsluggish to light, incoördination, delayed sensations. There was also\r\na history of pains in the legs, compared by the patient to those of\r\nsciatica. These pains came in crises, the longest of which had lasted\r\n30 hours.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this soldier’s troubles began the day after his shock\r\nwith a feeling of swollen feet and of cotton wool under them. He stayed\r\non service, however, walking with increasing difficulty.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his evacuation, July 10, he could walk with great\r\ndifficulty. “Strips of lead were between his legs.” He could hardly\r\ncontrol movements in the dark, or descend stairs. Often his legs would\r\nbend under him. Vesical function sluggish.\r\n\r\nAfter a few months the patient could walk better. In February, 1916,\r\nhe walked thrusting his legs forward trembling, and dragging toes a\r\nlittle. He could not support himself on either leg. Jerkiness and\r\nincoördination in extension or flexion of leg on thigh.\r\n\r\nThe muscular weakness was decidedly against tabes or at all events\r\na pure tabes. The incoördination proved to be due, not to loss\r\nof position sense (which was intact) but to unsteady muscular\r\ncontractions. Deep sensibility was intact.\r\n\r\nThere were no mental symptoms. There was a slight hesitation in speech\r\nand doubling of syllables, but nothing demonstrable with test phrases.\r\n\r\nThe serum W. R. was positive.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion; unconsciousness: Neurosyphilis.\r\n\r\n=Case 24.= (HURST, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private, 31, was in the retreat from Mons, was blown up by a shell\r\nand buried in May, 1915, went back to the front after two months leave,\r\nwas knocked unconscious by a shell December, 1916. He came to himself\r\ntwo days later in the hospital, but remained confused and lethargic.\r\nIn England, December 21, his legs were still weak and walking was\r\nunsteady. The right pupil reacted neither to light nor to accommodation\r\nand was irregular, eccentric, and dilated. The left pupil showed the\r\nArgyll-Robertson reaction. There was early primary optic atrophy.\r\nThe right knee-jerk was slightly exaggerated. The vibration sense\r\nwas reduced over sacrum and malleoli. At this time the man’s mental\r\ncondition was practically normal.\r\n\r\nThe Wassermann reaction of the serum and spinal fluid proved positive.\r\nImprovement followed rest, iodide, mercury, and seven injections of\r\nsalvarsan. By the middle of February he was able to walk well. The\r\nright pupil regained its power to react to accommodation, but remained\r\ninactive to light. Meanwhile, the left pupil had regained a slight\r\npower to react to light.\r\n\r\n_Re_ treatment of syphilis, both Thibierge and Lépine give warning\r\nof some bad results with arsenobenzol treatment, though Thibierge\r\nstates that the number of serious accidents and especially of deaths\r\nhas diminished more and more now that no arsenobenzol (drug No.\r\n914) is given. Encephalitis is the gravest of the untoward results\r\nof injection, sometimes appearing in young and vigorous subjects.\r\nHemorrhagic encephalitis appears to occur more frequently after the\r\nsecond injection than after the first, and according to Thibierge may\r\nbe especially suspected in subjects who after the first injection\r\npresent much fever, congestion of face, and cutaneous eruptions.\r\nTreatment in these cases should be suspended or given in moderate\r\ndoses.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion: Neurosyphilis. Fit for light duty.\r\n\r\n=Case 25.= (HURST, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA corporal, 26, blown up by a shell December 7, 1916, was admitted\r\nto the hospital on the 13th, dazed and with symptoms of a left-sided\r\nhemiplegia of organic origin. The right pupil was larger than the left.\r\nThere was a bruise of the scalp in the right parietal region. The\r\nman had had syphilis at 16. The Wassermann reaction of the serum was\r\nstrongly positive. Rest, salvarsan, mercury, and iodides were given,\r\nand the general symptoms and hemiplegia gradually disappeared, until\r\non December 12 there was only a moderate weakness of the left side,\r\nwith knee-jerks in excess, abdominal reflexes absent, and the Babinski\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\nThe Wassermann reaction was still strongly positive. Salvarsan,\r\nmercury, and iodide were continued. January 6, 1917, the plantar reflex\r\nhad become flexor. The abdominal reflex returned. Babinski’s second\r\nsign (combined flexion of thigh and pelvis) was now the only evidence\r\nof organic disease. Further antisyphilitic treatment removed this sign\r\nalso. February 28, the man was discharged fit for light duty, with\r\nunequal pupils and positive Wassermann reaction, and a complete amnesia\r\nfor the four weeks following his blowing up in the trenches.\r\n\r\n_Re_ fitness for light duty, see remarks on Case 20 concerning desk\r\nduty for certain tabetics.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the premature or unexpectedly early appearance of neurosyphilis\r\nunder war conditions, the early claims of some authors have not been\r\nmaintained. In the above instance, the infection was at 16 and the\r\nshell explosion occurred at 26, namely, at about the right interval for\r\nthe development of neurosyphilitic signs. Gerver states that military\r\nservice brings out the lesions of paresis earlier than they would\r\notherwise come. Bonhoeffer has been unable to show that cerebrospinal\r\nsyphilis is favored in its development by the exhaustion factor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELL-SHOCK PSEUDOPARESIS (non-syphilitic). Recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 26.= (PITRES and MARCHAND, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nJune 19, 1915, a shell exploded some distance from Lieutenant R. He\r\nremembers the gaseous smell, the bursting of several shells nearby\r\nand a sensation of being lifted into the air. When he recovered\r\nconsciousness, he was in hospital at Paris-Plage, covered with bruises\r\nand scratches. They told him he had been delirious and had vomited and\r\nspat blood.\r\n\r\nJune 24, his wife came to see him, but this visit he could not\r\nremember. Nor could his wife at first recognize him, he was so thin. He\r\nroused a few moments and recognized his wife, but relapsed into torpor\r\nagain. Speech was difficult and ideas confused.\r\n\r\nA few days later he was able to rise; but his mental status grew worse,\r\nespecially as to speech and writing, the latter quite illegible. There\r\nwas insomnia, or, if he slept, war dreams.\r\n\r\nAugust 7, he began a period of five months’ convalescence passed with\r\nhis family, depressed, given to spells of weeping, confined to bed or\r\ncouch, unable to “find words,” conscious of his state and troubled\r\nabout it, speaking of nothing but the war, and afraid to go out for\r\nfear of ambuscade. There was at first a slight lameness of the right\r\nleg. Although he could walk, he felt pain in the knee on flexing the\r\nright leg on the thigh. He walked holding this leg in extension.\r\n\r\nOn going back to the colors, he was immediately evacuated to the\r\n_Centre Neurologique_ at Bordeaux, January 20, 1916.\r\n\r\nExamination found a bored, impatient, irritated man, vexed that a man\r\nwho was not sick should be sent up “_comme fou_.”\r\n\r\nOmitting negative details, neurological examination showed slight\r\nlameness as above, body stiff and movements jerky, difficult, unsteady\r\ngait. The lieutenant could stand for some time on either leg. Tongue\r\nand face tremulous during speech. Limbs moderately tremulous,\r\nespecially in the performance of test movements.\r\n\r\nKnee-jerks and Achilles jerks absent. Other reflexes, including\r\npupillary, normal. Segmentary hypalgesia of right leg, especially\r\nabout knee. Tremulous speech and writing. Patient would stop short in\r\nspeaking for lack of words.\r\n\r\nMalnutrition. Appetite good, but a bursting feeling after meals.\r\n\r\nSkin dry, scaly on legs, fissured on fingers.\r\n\r\nSerum W. R. negative. Fluid not examined.\r\n\r\n=Mental examination.= Conscious and complaining of his troubles,\r\nLieutenant R. claimed persistently that he was not sick. Memory for\r\nrecent events was in general poor. Errands easily forgotten. Lost in\r\nthe street. Complaint of corpse odors round him. Everybody is looking\r\nat him and making fun of him. He was apt to insult bystanders. He was\r\nafraid of German spies. Things in shops angered him as they seemed to\r\nhim to be of German manufacture.\r\n\r\nThere were frequent periods of depression, with pallor and no\r\nspontaneous speech for some hours to a half-day. Headaches coming on\r\nand stopping suddenly.\r\n\r\nAs to diagnosis, the first impression, say Pitres and Marchand, was\r\nthat of general paresis. The progress of symptoms after the shock was\r\nconsistent with this diagnosis. The mental state and the physical\r\nfindings seemed consistent, although the pupils were normal. His\r\npartial insight into his symptoms was not inconsistent with the\r\ndiagnosis. He had a characteristic self-confidence. There had been four\r\nstillbirths (two twins); two children are alive, 11 and 13. Typhoid\r\nfever at 30. Syphilis denied. No mental disease in the family.\r\n\r\nThe patient had never done military duty, having been invalided for\r\n“right apex.” But he had volunteered and been accepted in September,\r\n1914.\r\n\r\n    How was Lieutenant R. cured? Apparently by rest in the _Centre\r\n    Neurologique_. Pitres and Marchand do not speak of the subtle\r\n    relation between mental state and the idea of non-return\r\n    to military service. This motive might still work even if\r\n    Lieutenant R. kept protesting sincerely that he wanted to go\r\n    back into military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar strain; shell explosion; unconsciousness. Sensory and motor\r\ndisorders. Subject an old syphilitic.\r\n\r\n=Case 27.= (KARPLUS, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA captain, 34, was under much stress and strain in the field and gave\r\nhimself over to excesses of alcohol and tobacco. August 25, 1914, at\r\nthe Krasnik battle he suddenly saw at his right a gleam of fire and was\r\nafterward able to remember very distinctly the words of a lieutenant\r\nstanding near by, “The man is dead.” Three or four hours later he came\r\nto himself at a relief post, vomited and bled a good deal from nose and\r\nmouth. He heard later that he had been thrown on his back.\r\n\r\nManual tremors and general pains developed in the next few days. Two\r\nweeks after the accident a slight nystagmus on looking to the left\r\nappeared, but there was otherwise no disorder of head or extremities.\r\nHe was able to sit up, supported by his arms, and he was able to\r\ncontract his abdominal muscles normally. As for his legs, active\r\nmovements were limited and weak. He could not lift his legs. The\r\nparalysis was more marked distally. He could walk with the support of\r\ntwo persons, but was unable to lift his feet from the ground. The right\r\nupper abdominal reflex was elicited, and both patellar reflexes were\r\ntolerably active. Cremasteric and plantar reflexes were absent. Neither\r\nof the Achilles jerks could be produced. There was hypesthesia and\r\nhypalgesia of the lower extremities, and of the back up to a horizontal\r\nline corresponding with the ninth dorsal segment; thermo-hyperesthesia\r\nand disorder of vibration sense in the lower legs. Both the motor and\r\nthe sensory disorders were more marked on the right than the left.\r\nInsomnia and battle dreams.\r\n\r\nThe gait disorder and paresis gradually improved. There was no\r\nalimentary glycosuria and adrenalin produced no mydriasis. In the\r\ncourse of several weeks the patient gained seven kilograms, began to\r\nsleep well and showed gradual improvement in his gait and in the\r\nexecution of various movements with his feet. The abdominal reflexes\r\nwere now both present, but there were no plantar reflexes and the\r\nAchilles were still both absent. The sensory disorder remained\r\nunchanged, so far as the skin was concerned, but the deep sensibility\r\nimproved. Both legs from the knee down were somewhat cold.\r\n\r\nThis man had had syphilis at twenty-two, had gone through an inunction\r\ncure, and repeated W. R.’s came through negative. He had suffered from\r\nvomiting spells and anxiety feelings for a number of years which had\r\nbeen diagnosed by physicians as cardiac neurosis. Yet for a year before\r\ngoing into the war he had felt absolutely well.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion: Amnesia; syphilitic hemiplegia. Recovery except for\r\namnesia as to brief period and loss of occupational skill.\r\n\r\n=Case 28.= (MAIRET and PIÉRON, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man of 40 underwent shell shock June 15, 1915, and had no remembrance\r\nof what happened up to July, 1915, when in hospital at Tunis he felt\r\n“born again.”\r\n\r\nExamined in January, 1916, it was found that he had a left hemiplegia\r\n(in fact, he had a syphilitic hemiplegia on that side, several years\r\nbefore, which had disappeared under antisyphilitic treatment). This\r\nhemiplegia passed, but he then had crises of depression due to his\r\ndespair at not being able to know who he was and what he was doing.\r\nHe could speak French and Spanish, and knew from the hospital ticket\r\nthat he was born in Spain; but he had no idea what had happened to\r\nhis relatives or what he was doing in France. He had, however, a very\r\ncorrect idea of what happened during six months after July, 1915.\r\n\r\nOne morning in April, 1916, his old memories came back all of a sudden\r\non waking. The gap was filled up to the moment of the shock. There was\r\nno gap left except for a period of about 25 days following the shock.\r\nHe now found that he knew a little English but that he had lost his\r\nstenography as well as his professional skill at typewriting.\r\n\r\n_Re_ French statistics for the occurrence of general paresis, Lautier\r\nfound 27 cases in 426. Early in the war, Boucherot at Fleury received\r\nfour cases of paresis among 107 cases; the majority of these, however,\r\nhad not left the interior. Consiglio in Italy received two cases out of\r\n270.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hemiplegia in this case, it may be inquired whether the hemiplegia\r\nwhich developed after the shell explosion on the same side of the body\r\non which the patient had a true syphilitic hemiplegia, was really\r\nsyphilitic or not. Was it not, perhaps, in some sense psychogenic? A\r\nsimilar question may be raised concerning cases in which the _locus\r\nminoris resistentiae_ becomes the site of symptoms. See Cases 409-414.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Hysterical blindness. Signs of cerebrospinal syphilis:\r\nNevertheless, amaurosis functional.\r\n\r\n=Case 29.= (LAIGNEL-LAVASTINE and COURBON, March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier of the class of 1906 underwent shell-shock August 13, 1914,\r\nregaining consciousness 20 days later, but blind. The light of the\r\nshellburst, he said, was the last thing he had seen.\r\n\r\nFor sixteen months, he was transferred from hospital to hospital,\r\nlooked on sometimes as blinded; sometimes as feigning. Finally, on the\r\nisolation service of Maison-Blanche, December 15, 1915, he received\r\nan ophthalmologist’s diagnosis namely, hysterical amaurosis. At this\r\ntime there were found: stereotyped winking, with slight lachrymation,\r\na slight left external strabismus, limitation in movement of all\r\nthe extrinsic muscles of both eyes, especially to the right and in\r\nconvergence and elevation; pupils slightly smaller than normal--and\r\nthe general impression of a genuinely blinded or amblyopic subject. He\r\nseemed to be able to distinguish faint whitish spots, without contour\r\nor color, in objects brought to a distance of at least 40 cm.\r\n\r\nHe also complained of bad feelings inside his head on the left side,\r\nand he proved to have a left-sided hemianesthesia of hysterical nature.\r\nThere were no other sensory disorders and no reflex disorders.\r\n\r\nThe nasolabial fold on the left side was flattened out, and there\r\nwas also on the same side a slight diminution in the lower abdominal\r\nskin reflexes, and no response to plantar stimulation. Examination\r\nof the mouth showed leucoplakia, and the history showed that the\r\nman’s fifth child was born before term and died at two months. Lumbar\r\npuncture yielded lymphocytosis (55 cells) and an excess of albumin. The\r\nfundus examination showed a slight papillary disorder, suggesting a\r\nretrobulbar affection of the optic nerves.\r\n\r\nHowever, the preservation of the pupil reflexes seemed to indicate\r\nthat nine-tenths, at least, of the amaurosis was functional. After\r\nmercurial treatment the headache grew less and the man was able to see\r\nsomewhat better with his right eye.\r\n\r\nLaignel-Lavastine and Courbon suggest that there was a dynamic disorder\r\nin this case, bearing the same relation to vision as mental confusion\r\nbears to the process of ideation. Analogous phenomena have been found\r\nin the sense of hearing, in such wise that the victims can, as it were,\r\npassively hear but do not listen.\r\n\r\n_Re_ functional eye cases, see below, especially Cases 432-437.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell shock (functional) phenomena in a syphilitic.\r\n\r\n=Case 30.= (BABONNEIX and DAVID, June, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA marine, 26, on land service March, 1916, was buried by the explosion\r\nof a large calibre shell which killed most of his comrades. He remained\r\nfor a time in a sort of lethargy. Coming to, he found himself victim\r\nof a right hemiplegia and deafmutism, which phenomena vanished under\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nIn July, however, he had to be sent to a hospital on account of his\r\nsufferings, which received the diagnoses _commotio cerebri_, disorder\r\nof consciousness, disorientation, delirium, amnesia, over-emotionality.\r\nHe was sent back to the front in December, 1916, but promptly reported\r\nsick, with headaches and insomnia.\r\n\r\nExamination showed nonorganic nervous disorders, consisting in\r\na variable and patchy anesthesia of the legs, anesthesia of the\r\nconjunctiva and pharynx, and over-reaction, with sighing, during the\r\ncourse of the examination. The organic signs were: exaggeration of\r\ntendon reflexes, equilibration disorder, and incapacity to stand on\r\none foot or execute a half turn or to stand still with eyes closed,\r\nand disorder of position sense. The lumbar puncture showed no cells,\r\na slight globulin reaction, and an albumin titer within the normal.\r\nThere was a leucoplakia and a positive W. R. The man was emaciated,\r\nfebrile, and showed signs, with the X-ray, of bronchial lymph node\r\ndisease. According to Babonneix and David, the normality of the fluid\r\nindicates that the phenomena here were Shell-shock phenomena, despite\r\nthe indisputable syphilis of the blood serum.\r\n\r\n_Re_ occurrence of functional phenomena in syphilitics, Freud’s remark\r\nmay be recalled to the effect that a large proportion of his hysterics\r\nand other psychoneurotics are the offspring of syphilitics.\r\n\r\nConsider in this connection also Case 28: an old syphilitic hemiplegia\r\nwas followed by a probably psychogenic or hysterical hemiplegia on the\r\nsame side.\r\n\r\n\r\nVestibular symptoms in a neurosyphilitic.\r\n\r\n=Case 31.= (GUILLAIN and BARRÉ, April, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, Colonial, 29, was twice in the 6th Army neurological\r\ncentre. The first time, February, 1916, he was under observation for\r\nastasia-abasia, having been invalided twice for this disease,--once\r\nin 1915. This man had had syphilis at 21, and was then taken care of\r\nat Saint-Louis Hospital and at Cochin. A volunteer for the duration\r\nof war, September, 1914, he had intermittent disorders of station and\r\nwalking, which caused his invaliding January, 1915. As the trouble\r\nstopped, he asked to go back to the front in September, but the same\r\ndifficulty reappeared with fatigue, and he was sent to the army\r\nneurological centre. When standing, there was a ceaseless trembling of\r\nthe whole body but especially of the legs, with tendency to propulsion.\r\nIn walking also, there was a trepidant abasia, sometimes dizziness, and\r\neven a sudden fall. Standing on one foot he trembled and fell.\r\n\r\nExamined on his back, muscular strength was found intact in all limbs,\r\nand there was no trembling or incoördination or intention tremor in\r\nthe performance of any movements, though there was a slight trembling\r\nof the raised fingers and hand. Reflexes were normal. The right pupil\r\nwas dilated; the left pupil reacted sluggishly. There were lateral\r\nnystagmiform movements to the left. Caloric nystagmus appeared from\r\nthe right ear in 15 seconds, from the left in 30. Rotatory nystagmus\r\nappeared in 35 seconds on both sides. Lumbar puncture yielded a fluid\r\nwith a slight lymphocytosis; albumin, .3 grams; chloride, 7.30; sugar\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nRest in bed improved the astasia-abasia, and the man was sent back to\r\nhis corps, February 20, 1916. He came back March 16, having had a dizzy\r\nspell, with suffocation feeling and a fall, whereupon the trepidant\r\nastasia-abasia had reappeared. There were none of the so-called\r\ndefensive reflexes. The neuromuscular excitability of gastrocnemii was\r\nless on the right than on the left. A von Graefe sign was sometimes\r\nfound; no diplopia save on looking far to right.\r\n\r\n\r\nLay reflections on syphilis: Suicidal attempts.\r\n\r\n=Case 32.= (COLIN and LAUTIER, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man was called to the auxiliaries at the outbreak of the war, and\r\nserved as stretcher-bearer at the Marne. He then became an attendant at\r\nthe Grand-Palais. Acquiring gonorrhoea, he was cared for but he grew\r\ndepressed. The blood was examined and the W. R. found positive. The\r\nphysician immediately made known the result without circumlocution,\r\nand knowing vaguely that the W. R. meant syphilis, the patient felt an\r\nirresistible impulse to suicide, and cut his throat. It seems that he\r\nhad often before said that if he got syphilis he would kill himself.\r\nRecovering from his wound, he was invalided to Villejuif, Sept. 19,\r\n1916, breathing through a cannula and responding to questions in\r\nwriting. He had always been a nervous and emotional man, a farmer in\r\nAuvergne; he was married and the father of several children.\r\n\r\nExamination showed that the recurrent nerves had been cut and that the\r\nman must needs always breathe through the cannula. In point of fact,\r\nthe W. R., only partially positive at the outset, did not indicate\r\nsyphilis, and the gonorrhoea was now cured. But though the patient\r\nknew these facts, his hypochondria persisted, basing itself upon the\r\nsuicidal wound. He said that his larynx had been stolen and he wondered\r\nwhy. He said that he had violent crises of suffocation, though there\r\nwas, as a matter of fact, no difficulty with his breathing. Verdigris,\r\nhe said, was forming on his cannula. Self-accusations about the suicide\r\ndeveloped. On being transferred to his department asylum, he made a\r\nsuicidal attempt on the trip.\r\n\r\nOf course the gonorrhoea may have served as a partial factor in the\r\ngenesis of the case, and his own mental attitude toward the contraction\r\nof syphilis may have been another factor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe imitation of chancre.\r\n\r\n=Case 33.= (PICK, July, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA married German farmer, 32, was in Prague hospital in 1908 during his\r\nperiod of military service and was then treated by inunction for a\r\nlocal chancre. He was given mercurial injections a year later for rash.\r\n\r\nIn 1912, he had signs of syphilis in the mouth.\r\n\r\nHe was sent home from service in 1913, with ulcers of hand.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war he was found to have ulcers on the knee,\r\nlegs, and mouth, and was sent home for six months.\r\n\r\nAgain called up in 1915, the ulcers were still in evidence; he got\r\ninunctions in a military hospital four months.\r\n\r\nHe was sent to his corps in July and had no relapse until July, 1916,\r\nwhen he was detailed for active service. Thereupon, ulcers began on the\r\nleft hand and right leg. He reported sick, but was sent nevertheless\r\nto the front. In hospital he was found to have several scars about\r\none inch across on each leg, on the dorsum of the left hand, at the\r\nright of the left index finger, and elsewhere. These scars were deeply\r\npigmented. _One of them was square!_ There were other recent ulcers\r\nthat closely resembled tertiary ulcers. The most recent of these ulcers\r\nwas angular, intensely red, and showed remains of a collapsed vesicle.\r\nThere was a deep dark scab on the mucous membrane of the left cheek.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that these ulcers were produced by some caustic, the\r\nnature of which remains unknown. The patient had, however, been able to\r\nevade military obligation during peace time and for two years during\r\nwar time.\r\n\r\n_Re_ simulation, according to Pick, some 5 to 7 per cent venereal\r\ndiseases in the German army have been simulations. Gonorrhoea is\r\nsimulated by soap, balanitis by cantharides, soft chancre by soap\r\nand mercuric or mercurous chloride mixed, hard chancre by a fluid or\r\npowder containing NaOH, Na_{2}CO, and NaCl. Secondary syphilitic signs\r\nare imitated by cantharides or garlic, producing scrotal dermatitis.\r\nTertiaries are imitated with caustics.\r\n\r\n\r\nRamón to Rosina: a soldier’s letter to his fiancée.\r\n\r\n=Case 34.= (BUSCAINO and COPPOLA, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\n    “I am here to stay a month. Believe me, it is better here than\r\n    in the army. There is a rule that we may eat as much as we can\r\n    and everything is of the very best. The servants treat us like\r\n    brothers. Do not think it is a nuisance to be inside four walls\r\n    with a wee bit of a garden. No, indeed! But I have got to act\r\n    the fool and from the very first day I began to play and act\r\n    crazy with a kitten, so that if you had seen me you would say:\r\n    “Ramón is really crazy.” Rosina, dear, to avoid paying taxes\r\n    you have got to be a smuggler. And now that I am at the ball I\r\n    have got to dance. I want to see if after all the suffering I\r\n    cannot get something better. I am better off here than at the\r\n    regiment. I sleep in a fine warm bed, and they have only cold\r\n    straw; I have good food and drink and plenty of milk, and they\r\n    have poor food and drink and so little.\r\n\r\n    “I expect to go home in about three weeks. I would have been\r\n    there before if some fool of a spy at our place had held his\r\n    tongue and minded his own business. At the same time, Rosina,\r\n    dear, remember what I told you at Leghorn: that they had some\r\n    officers sent there to get information and instead of going\r\n    home they asked somebody else and were told that I had never\r\n    been sick and had never had neurasthenia. When this information\r\n    was got from the officers I was called to the office and they\r\n    read to me that all that I had said and done was not true. I\r\n    kept on acting the fool, and as they were still doubtful they\r\n    sent me here, where there is a professor who passes me every\r\n    morning in the garden and says: “How are you?” I always say:\r\n    “I am the same,” acting like a crazy man. Let me tell you,\r\n    Rosina dear, not to say anything contrary to this in your\r\n    letters because they open and read everything in order to find\r\n    out everything that happens and everything that is said. Now\r\n    what you must do is to ask me how I am feeling, and whether my\r\n    headaches are gone, and whether I have them all the time as\r\n    formerly, and any other trifle that will help me.”\r\n\r\nRosina’s fiancé had a strongly positive W. R. in the serum. It was\r\nnegative in the fluid. He was returned to the front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. HYPOPHRENOSES\r\n\r\n(THE FEEBLE-MINDED GROUP)\r\n\r\n\r\nMoron of use at front (alienist’s report).\r\n\r\n=Case 35.= (PRUVOST, 1915.)\r\n\r\nVigouroux reports concerning a tanner of 19 who could not read, write\r\nor calculate (3 plus 8 equals 14) and had been of the 1916 class in an\r\ninfantry regiment at Brest, on the occasion of his asking to be sent to\r\nthe front more speedily:\r\n\r\nMental weakness, with insufficient school and theoretical knowledge but\r\nwith the ability to assimilate practical ideas, though not knowing how\r\nto read, write or calculate; seems to have earned his living in several\r\nlines. “As a soldier, he does not know the insignia of the different\r\nranks but understands how to obey a superior officer. Understands a gun\r\nand can tell a _chargeur_ from a _Le Bel_ gun. Moreover he seems to be\r\nperfectly stable, fixed in his wishes, persistently and intelligently\r\nwants to go to the front and kill Boches. He appears to be well\r\ndisciplined and educable. Although feebleminded, he appears to us able\r\nto be useful at the front, though he should not be employed in any\r\nundertaking requiring initiative or foresight.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAn imbecile, superbrave.\r\n\r\n=Case 36.= (PRUVOST, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA loquacious, active fellow, 22, with very slight school knowledge and\r\nno idea of military ranks (treated his superiors like his comrades),\r\nwas often punished in the barracks. He did not get on well with his\r\ninstructors. His activities were never interrupted by any obstacles or\r\nby derision. He kept singing and talking enthusiastically during the\r\nmobilization. He was the butt of his section.\r\n\r\nAt Dinant he did very well; though his section was losing a good many\r\nmen he remained calm. He was careless of danger and remained at his\r\npost firing ceaselessly at the enemy and giving a magnificent example\r\nto the few comrades who remained with him. In fact, he remained so long\r\nin his shelter that he was surrounded and taken prisoner. He escaped,\r\nswam the Meuse and got back to his regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn imbecile of service in barracks work.\r\n\r\n=Case 37.= (PRUVOST, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA farmer, 36 (father alcoholic, mother always sick, two brothers at the\r\nfront; patient had typhoid at an unknown age; had gone to school at\r\n13 but “learned nothing”; worked in fields with his brother who gave\r\nhim some pennies on Sunday), was put into the auxiliary service by the\r\nCouncil at 20. Patient said he was not strong enough for this service.\r\nIn 1914 the Council reconsidered the case and put him into a regiment\r\nof infantry. He could not be given military instruction or execute the\r\nmost simple drilling manual. He said that 4 plus 2 equalled 7; 4 plus\r\n3 equalled 5. He was of an excellent character, very docile and easily\r\ndirected. He did all his comrades’ barracks work and was very proud\r\nbecause, as he said, “I do everything they tell me to do.” He was happy\r\nin working, everybody was good to him, but he had no comrades. He had\r\nno general knowledge and knew nothing about the war but that they were\r\nfighting the Boche.\r\n\r\n_Re_ imbeciles, Colin, Lautier and Magnac found amongst 1000 soldiers\r\nentering Villejuif, 53 imbeciles. Twenty-four of them had been either\r\nexempt or retired at the outset of the war, when military surgeons had\r\nreviewed them and considered them fit for service. Several of the 29\r\nothers also had shown previous evidence of imbecility.\r\n\r\nOf course, French military surgeons may have felt that a number of\r\nthese men would be of just such service in barracks and otherwise as\r\nCase 37 (Pruvost). But for one or two cases like Cases 37 and 41 of\r\nPruvost, there are great numbers of other imbeciles who prove quite\r\nuseless in the army. Two of the Villejuif cases had been volunteers:\r\none volunteer declared that, if he had been intelligent, he never would\r\nhave enlisted! Ten cases proved unable to use a gun; one turned his gun\r\nupon his mates. One regularly forgot the password. One (see Case 42\r\nof Lautier) thought the war too long and tried to take command of the\r\ncompany in order to finish the war one way or the other. Three of the\r\nimbeciles had to be evacuated for desertion (unmotivated fugues); two\r\nof them cursed their officers. Some of the imbeciles had an emotional\r\ndiarrhoea throughout their service.\r\n\r\nColin suggests that line officers and military surgeons ought to agree\r\nthat these men are not fit for service, and that the civil authorities\r\nof the home towns should advise the review boards about known imbeciles\r\nand criminals. In point of fact, previous knowledge of imbecility could\r\nhave been obtained quite readily in 27 of the 53 cases observed by\r\nColin.\r\n\r\n\r\nA feeble-minded inventor.\r\n\r\n=Case 38.= (LAIGNEL-LAVASTINE and BALLET, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA jockey of Nîmes, 31, entered the service May 15, 1917. He\r\nretired before the war. He was in the auxiliaries at the moment of\r\nmobilization. Nothing is known as to any pathological episodes in his\r\npast. He said he had been a poor scholar, had left the primary school\r\nat eleven hardly knowing how to write or spell, but he had a lively\r\nimagination and was a happy-go-lucky youth, playing many tricks on\r\nthe trades people. He tried a variety of ideas in the industrial or\r\ncommercial world with very varying success. He had a mechanical taste.\r\nThe Colonial Exposition at Marseilles caused him to float a variety of\r\nprojects, from that of having the visitors photographed on a camel to\r\nthe sale of lemonade. He said he had been a jockey and then a trainer\r\nand had finally become a valet de jockey at Maisons Laffitte. He was a\r\ngambler and invented a “system.” He made various inventions in relation\r\nto horses. At the end of 1914 he had plans for a bomb thrower and\r\nplaced his discovery at the service of the War Minister. He was not\r\ndiscouraged by the lack of success of the bomb thrower. He now made an\r\naerial torpedo carrier. He had the idea of the tanks. However, he found\r\nthe secret of his torpedo carrier printed in a magazine. There was a\r\nslight difference between the German apparatus and his own.\r\n\r\nFrom this time he began to be mistrustful, and now he jealously avoided\r\nentering into any details about his inventions and he did not let\r\nhis officers see his plans. The Commandant offered to give a place\r\nin the safe to his documents, but he could not embrace the offer. He\r\nnow invented a counter-torpedo machine. He went on leave to Paris,\r\nasked an audience of the Minister of Marine, who put him in relation\r\nto the Committee on Inventions, who put him off, desiring that he\r\nshould forward all his plans. He emerged from one of his interviews so\r\nexcited that there was a scandal on the public street and the police\r\ncommissary evacuated him to Val-de-Grâce, but the patient says he does\r\nnot remember this incident. He came on service of Laignel-Lavastine\r\nMay 15. He shortly wrote again to the Minister, who again referred\r\nhim to the Committee on Inventions. He protested to the President of\r\nthe Republic and wrote directly to the King of England, who referred\r\nhim to the Military Administration. He is now occupied in creating a\r\nmachine to destroy the first line trenches and continues to write to\r\nthe Ministry. He has documents buried underground in a secret place. He\r\nstill talks with great vivacity of his discoveries.\r\n\r\nAccording to Laignel-Lavastine, we deal with a feeble-minded person who\r\nhas for many years had a _délire raisonnant_ of the inventing group.\r\n\r\n_Re_ feeblemindedness in the British Army, Shuttleworth found 70 who\r\nhad joined from special schools for the feeble-minded in London, and\r\n100 from Birmingham in the year 1915. The institutional “children” were\r\nin general good at drilling and obeying. One of them, given to lying\r\nand stealing, got into constant trouble in Flanders.\r\n\r\nSir George Savage stated that he had sometimes run the risk of allowing\r\nenlistment of men who had shown earlier in life a weakness for lying\r\nand pilfering, and remarked that such men might make good soldiers.\r\nA case like the above (38) would run counter to this view. On this\r\nmatter, see below Case 183 (Henderson), one of pathological lying.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn imbecile who walked lame.\r\n\r\n=Case 39.= (PRUVOST, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 20, eight days after being called to the colors, complained\r\nof pain in the knee and hip. He was observed for 18 days in hospital\r\nand then sent back to his company; but he continued to complain of the\r\npains, and the regimental surgeon sent him to a neurological center\r\nwhere the joints were found to be normal and where no sensory, motor or\r\nreflex disorders were in evidence. The man continued to walk lame and\r\ninsisted he could not get about without a cane. He also complained of\r\nhis mouth and his belly and, though he was very ruddy, said he was _á\r\nbout de forces_.\r\n\r\nIt was a question of simulation. The man, however, was a feebleminded\r\nperson who could not read, write or calculate. He was invalided as such.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnlistment to improve character.\r\n\r\n=Case 40.= (BRIAND, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA village boy had passed for simple ever since typhoid fever at 8.\r\nHe had learned to read and write, but had always been impulsive\r\nand subject to fugues, running to see his grandmother, or off as a\r\ntruant. It was decided that he, at 19, should enlist to improve his\r\ncharacter. But one fine day, even before the war, he deserted. He said,\r\nin explanation, that he had lost his way, and he was being examined\r\nmentally when mobilization began.\r\n\r\nHe looked ape-like, with spread ears; had a low forehead, a head\r\nflattened behind, an asymmetrical face, prognathous jaws, an arched\r\npalate, and defective teeth. He talked freely of homosexual relations,\r\nand said he wandered off because it occurred to him to do so. He was\r\ndetermined to be unfit for service.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn imbecile who may be sent to the front.\r\n\r\n=Case 41.= (PRUVOST, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Parisian sandwichman, 25, of unknown parentage and a state ward,\r\nplaced out with a farmer at 12, escaping with a friend to Bordeaux at\r\n14, thence leading a wild, improvident life at Lyons, Marseilles and\r\nParis, sleeping in fields and hedges, earning 22 sous a day but in no\r\ncase mixing with the police, was examined for physical inefficiency\r\nat 20 years. He wanted to enlist but was refused. He insisted and was\r\nvery proud of the fact that he got in as the Major said to them, “Let\r\nhim go in.” He could hardly read, write or calculate but was by reason\r\nof his adventurous life full of practical resources. He was irascible\r\nand frequently _crimed_, whereupon he would cry under the Captain’s\r\nwindow, “Robber band, idiots, I shall write to the Minister.” He was\r\npassionately fond of military life, though he had but the vaguest\r\nnotions about the commands, the names of generals and the like. He\r\nwanted to drill. His comrades played practical jokes upon him asking\r\nhim to look for a trajectory, for the squad’s umbrella and the key\r\nto the drill ground. They also told him he had been proposed to be\r\ncorporal, whereupon he was greatly overjoyed and immediately sewed\r\nstripes on his sleeve and began to give commands. He said if they put\r\nhim among the auxiliaries he would throw the adjutant in the water. He\r\nsang and swung his gun with joy when he went to the front. He thought\r\nthere were stripes hanging to the barbed wire and wanted to pick as\r\nmany as possible. Such a man may be safely sent to the front although\r\nhe will bear watching. At the date of report this man had been at the\r\nfront two months doing very well.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the comparative success of the Germans in the matter of excluding\r\nimbeciles, Meyer found that 8 per cent of the mental cases in the army\r\nwere cases of mental defect.\r\n\r\n\r\nImbecile with sudden initiative.\r\n\r\n=Case 42.= (LAUTIER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 41, a farmer, from the Department of the Marne, married,\r\nchildless, was called to the colors August 31, 1914. He was on guard\r\nduty until May, 1915, watched prisoners until October and was finally\r\nsent to the front, February, 1916, where he fell sick.\r\n\r\n“He was tired in his head.” “His commanding officer made him drill\r\nwithout rhyme or reason; he would have been able himself to have\r\ncommanded with greater intelligence.” He once attempted to put himself\r\nat the head of the company to lead them against the Boche; this idea\r\narrived to him all of a sudden in a phase of perfect confidence and\r\n_sang froid_. He thought his comrades would follow him and that the\r\nofficers would do likewise. He hoped thus to be able to end the war\r\none way or the other. He was getting tired of the war and regretted\r\nhis family life and kept saying that this was no existence for family\r\nmen. “We ought to attack or ask for peace.” No one followed him and his\r\ncomrades said he was _un peu fou_ but he did not share this opinion.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact he hardly knew how to read or write and at home lived\r\nwith his relatives, submitting himself entirely to their guidance. He\r\nwas much afraid of being punished and often feared that he had done\r\nbadly as he had _trop de conscience_. He was non-alcoholic and without\r\nhereditary or acquired neuropathic taint. He had no pronounced stigmata\r\nof degeneration. He was rather reticent about certain mystical ideas of\r\na political tinge. At Villejuif, whither he was brought February 17,\r\n1916, he received a diagnosis of imbecility.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional fugue in a subnormal subject.\r\n\r\n=Case 43.= (BRIAND, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in the Territorial Army, 40, appeared before the examining\r\nboard in a depressed, dejected-looking state, speaking slowly but\r\ncollectedly and lucidly. Mobilized the second day, this man was much\r\nafraid that he could not get through the marches, and asked for a\r\nspecial examination to determine whether his feet did not make him\r\nunsuitable for fatigue. Two physicians thought he was unsuitable for\r\nmarching, and another thought he put it on. A trial march was not\r\nexecuted well. He was kept in barracks but jumped the wall, put on\r\ncivilian clothes, and made off for Paris. But a relative, warned by his\r\nwife, finally got him to go to the authorities. He was told that he\r\nought to return in the afternoon, when suddenly he was arrested.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the man relied on the opinion of the two physicians\r\nand discounted that of the third. He thought himself the victim of\r\nan injustice, and not knowing how to get on, it occurred to him that\r\nhe would abandon the regiment and get out of the difficulty. It was\r\nwithout resistance, however, that he gave himself up as a prisoner.\r\nThis fugue was neither unconscious nor amnestic, nor was it due to\r\nan irresistible impulse; nor can we say that it was due to a genuine\r\nintellectual disorder. It was an emotional fugue, and partly due to\r\nthe man’s long-standing depression. It seems that he had inherited\r\nthis character from his father. He was below normal intelligence,\r\nhad a very poor education, lost his wife, and grew more and more\r\nsombre. He married again, but this time a neuropath. He began to be\r\npreoccupied with his health and he had even some ideas of suicide. At\r\nthe time of his leaving the regiment, he had passed through a phase of\r\ndepression of about 6 months’ duration, and at this time had a number\r\nof hypochondriacal ideas with poor appetite and loss of weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnostic dispute between regimental surgeon and alienist.\r\n\r\n=Case 44.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nJulius Q. was sent on guard April 14, 1915, with orders to remain\r\nthere. While on guard he made a noise and made a movement as if to take\r\na knife from his pocket. Ordered to empty his pockets, he attacked the\r\nother guards. The witnesses said that he was drunk.\r\n\r\nUpon examination, it appeared that he had recognized and called by name\r\nthose present in the guardhouse, despite his supposed intoxication.\r\nThere were red spots on the skin and a certain amount of analgesia. His\r\npowers of computation and reasoning were poor. He was unable to explain\r\nthe meaning of a picture shown him. He maintained that he had an\r\nindomitable desire for drink. A diagnostic draught of alcohol yielded\r\nno reaction. Upon dismissal, he got drunk at once again, and had again\r\nto be imprisoned in a state of excitement. What the outcome in this\r\ncase was is not stated by Kastan.\r\n\r\nThe previous history seems important. Julius Q. had been a state ward.\r\nHe had escaped several times from the institution but had always to be\r\nbrought back again because he could not be trained at home. He had once\r\nattacked a supervisor in the state institution with a knife. It seems\r\nthat he had at this time been drunk, having been brought back drunk to\r\nthe institution.\r\n\r\nTwo years before the war he had been taken to the Breslau Hospital\r\nfor the Insane on account of fits of insanity. In 1913 he had been a\r\npatient in Wuhlgarten on similar grounds. The diagnosis there had been\r\nepileptoid degeneration, psychopathic constitution, imbecility, or\r\nepilepsy(?). He had been convicted of crimes a number of times and put\r\nto labor. He had been given to cruelty in childhood.\r\n\r\nDespite this, he was _declared perfectly healthy in mind and body by\r\nthe regimental surgeon_.\r\n\r\nIn 1914, Q. fell suddenly ill in prison (he was presumably in prison\r\nfor a military offence), and smeared the cell with feces, saying that\r\nhe was able to do that as he could pay for anything. He stared at\r\nthe floor and failed to answer questions. He remarked, however, that\r\nhe had frequently been convicted for breach of the peace and assault\r\nand battery, and he said his father had been a drunkard, and he\r\nacknowledged hallucinations to the extent of saying that he heard his\r\nname called when he was alone.\r\n\r\nThe story of this case warrants our inquiring why such a patient was\r\nkept in the army. He was kept there clearly on account of the report of\r\nthe regimental surgeon, who could not have taken seriously the previous\r\nhistory of the case, or else thought the patient perfectly good cannon\r\nfodder.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of syphilis apparently need not be entertained. That of\r\nfeeblemindedness is possibly the fundamental diagnosis, yet epilepsy\r\nwas considered by the German diagnosticians, doubtless on account of\r\nthe sudden violent attacks and breaches of peace on the part of the\r\npatient. There is clearly something behind mere alcoholism in the\r\nentire story of this state ward. On the whole, the periodicity of the\r\nattacks is equally consistent with the picture presented by numerous\r\nfeeble-minded persons, and the institutions that had to deal with Q.\r\nregarded him rather as epileptoid. There seems to be evidence of actual\r\nintellectual defect. Accordingly it seems wiser to consider the case\r\nof Julius Q. one of feeblemindedness, possibly of the moron group. We\r\nshould then consider the epileptoid features as part and parcel of the\r\nfeeblemindedness. We should consider the intellectual defect a part\r\nof the process; and the uncontrollable impulse to drink, the sudden\r\nviolent attacks, and the cruelty in childhood would then be regarded\r\nas merely symptomatic of the feeblemindedness. It seems clear that\r\neither mental tests by the regimental surgeon or an examination of the\r\npatient’s previous history would tend to exclude such a patient from\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can a rifleman be an imbecile?\r\n\r\n=Case 45.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAnton K. was down in the list as “missing.” He was found at home. He\r\nsaid his feet had become sore from the marching. He had lain down and\r\nbecome unconscious. Coming to his senses, he was possessed only of\r\ntrousers and a shirt but he got a civilian suit in a village. He had\r\ngone home part way by train, part way on foot. It seems that he did not\r\ntell his father any details about his coming back although he expressly\r\ndenied deserting.\r\n\r\nIt seems no mental weakness had been noticed in the army. It had been\r\nobserved, however, that after seeing the first corpses he was deeply\r\nimpressed and did not want to see any more. On examination in the\r\nhospital he gave the impression of indifference and low spirits. He had\r\nto be urged to eat and work. No great amount of intelligence defect\r\ncould be determined, though his knowledge and capacity were below the\r\naverage. The physician examining him thought his depression was either\r\ncaused by or increased by his imprisonment; but this examiner thought\r\nthat the protection of Section 51 did not extend to the patient at the\r\ntime of his desertion. The examiner thought that an examination by a\r\npsychiatrist was not necessary, though both judge and prosecutor urged\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen examined in the clinic, he seemed to be disoriented for time. He\r\nclaimed to have been able to stand the shooting and the sight of the\r\ncorpses. After becoming unconscious, he had wakened and eaten cucumbers\r\nand carrots in the fields, wandering on for a period of three or four\r\nweeks, until he came to a place where he had formerly worked. The\r\nreason he had thrown away his uniform was because Russians had been\r\nabout. He had not known that it was his duty to report to the army\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the patient’s father was poorly developed as to mind,\r\nthat his brother was subject to periodic mental disturbance so that he\r\nhad to be watched. It was found also that K. himself had had a similar\r\nmental disturbance, lasting a week, two years before. Moreover he was\r\nnot considered mentally right in his home town. In fact, no one there\r\nwondered really at his desertion because he was so stupid. His school\r\nwork had been poor and limited.\r\n\r\nHe himself said that his people were of sound mind; that during school\r\ndays he had felt bad in his head, once running into the woods after\r\nbeing told something. He was able to give the names of his former\r\nsuperiors. His calculations were only partly correct. He was poor at\r\nreasoning and at simple distinctions; for example, asked the difference\r\nbetween a bird and a butterfly, he replied that a butterfly was a bird\r\ntoo. He did not know the difference between a river and a lake. He\r\nthought Russia, England, and Austria were the enemies of Germany.\r\n\r\nHe sat about or lay on the floor, motionless and indifferent, with\r\na newspaper stuffed into his trousers, unoccupied although saying\r\nthat he wanted to work, and even allowing his fingers to be burned by\r\ncigarettes he was smoking.\r\n\r\nHe was tried once more and the first medical expert still adhered to\r\nhis former opinion, pointing out that K. was a rifleman and that _only\r\nan intelligent man could be a rifleman_. The court, however, accepted\r\nKastan’s opinion and granted K. the protection of Section 51.\r\n\r\nIn comment upon this case, it seems clear that ever so slight a\r\nknowledge of K’s home town reputation would have naturally excluded him\r\nfrom the army. However, what is to be said “when doctors disagree,”\r\nas noted by Kastan in this very case? It seems impossible, also, that\r\nhis comrades should not have noticed something odd about him (over\r\nand above the deep impression on seeing the first dead) which might\r\nhave given occasion to the regimental surgeon for a special mental\r\nexamination. However, to the military mind, mayhap the man seemed to be\r\nsufficiently “effective.”\r\n\r\n_Re_ imbecility in a rifleman, the compiler has studied somewhat\r\nelaborately the brain of a feeble-minded murderer with some North\r\nAmerican Indian blood in him. This man was a crack shot despite his\r\nsubnormality. It would seem that the German regimental surgeons\r\ncastigated by Kastan as above were very properly so castigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nHypomania in an imbecile.\r\n\r\n=Case 46.= (HAURY, August, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA brusque little man, of a somewhat bold and talkative disposition,\r\nthough giving a good first impression, was evidently a bit\r\nfeebleminded, though (as Haury says) of the active group. He had a\r\nsister like himself, whose children were taken care of by the State,\r\nand at home he had had a number of fugues, about which details were\r\nlacking. It was soon evident what sort of soldier he would make, and\r\nhe was put in one of the Territorial regiments, but it was not noted\r\nthat he had a genuine mental disorder, as he was thought to be just a\r\npeculiar person.\r\n\r\nHis new relations caused him to do a number of eccentric things.\r\nHe shortly proved to be in a sort of rudimentary maniacal state;\r\ntalkative, restless, scheming rather feebly to go back to his village.\r\nHe said that he couldn’t walk on account of corns, and that these corns\r\nrequired a certain drug, which he wanted to get from home. He said that\r\nhe had been struck by lightning twice; that he had fires in his body,\r\netc. He wanted only to be retired on a pension of one or two hundred\r\nfrancs so he could take care of his farm, his hay and his fields. There\r\nwas no need of trying to get land by means of bullets, he said, since\r\nhe had enough.\r\n\r\nThe mental disorder of this man was much deeper than appeared, and in\r\nfact, he did a number of dangerous things compromising the security of\r\nthe entire regiment.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the dangerous tendencies of Case 46, see the remarks above drawn\r\nfrom Colin, under Case 37.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsubordinate desire to remain at the front.\r\n\r\n=Case 47.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nFriedrich L., on March 4, 1915, was ordered to go back to the\r\nbaggage-train. He did not obey. He said to the non-commissioned officer\r\nwho then came to him, “I am not going; you have nothing to say anyhow,\r\nyou ox-tender!” He stood with his hands in his pockets, and, when the\r\nofficer seized him angrily by the collar, L. struck the officer’s face.\r\n\r\nHe stated at his hearing that no one had the right to send him back.\r\nAt that time even he conveyed the impression of being not quite normal\r\nand was let off with his arrest only. Later he refused again to go on\r\nguard duty, saying, “You have nothing to say at all. Perhaps you will\r\nfind out that we shall meet each other again in hell tomorrow morning.”\r\nHe was taken before the physician, who considered him mentally inferior\r\nand not entirely appreciative of the nature of his acts. He was told\r\nthat the death penalty would meet such behavior, whereupon he remarked,\r\n“I am not afraid of the death penalty,” staring excitedly at the\r\nofficer and trembling throughout his body. It seems that he had already\r\nmade an impression of mental inferiority in the troop, and had once\r\nbefore said to an officer who wanted to send him to the front, that he\r\nwould not go; this had been regarded as almost a breach of discipline.\r\nHe had been in the habit of not reacting to the calls of his superiors,\r\nand had smiled at their reproaches. He seemed to hold the opinion\r\nthat not even a company commander had power to order him to go back.\r\nExamined in the clinic he held to the same opinion, that there was no\r\nneed of his going back; that they took volunteers; and that he wanted\r\nto remain at the front. On the day of the deed, he had drunk a rye\r\nwhiskey. He had shaken off the non-commissioned officer because the\r\nleader had seized him by the throat. In the clinic he often smiled and\r\nwrinkled his forehead. He gave evasive and inadequate answers. Asked\r\nabout oaths and perjury, he remarked, “I prefer to remain silent.”\r\n\r\nHe said that one of his sisters was a little stupid. Study of his\r\nprevious history indicates that Friedrich L. had formerly been a quiet\r\nand steady man, although he often had attacks of rage, breaking out\r\nupon sudden excitements. As to his capacity in school, nothing could be\r\nlearned, since the Russians had taken the school registers away.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of this case seems to reduce to the question of\r\nfeeblemindedness and schizophrenia, unless some form of inborn\r\nqualitative inferiority of mind be preferred as the diagnosis. On the\r\nwhole, possibly, the diagnosis of feeblemindedness seems preferable.\r\nThe entire symptom picture seems to relate to the patient’s one mental\r\nattitude about sticking at the front, _ruat coelum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA French soldier who admired Germans.\r\n\r\n=Case 48.= (LAUTIER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man with the extraordinary first name of _Agapithe_ (Laurent insists\r\non the frequency of strange first names in degenerate families) came\r\nfrom Val-de-Grâce to Villejuif June 5, 1916, with the diagnosis\r\nof mental weakness, interpretative ideas of persecution, mental\r\nexcitement, recrimination, logorrhoea, and a tendency to revengeful\r\nreactions.\r\n\r\nOn arrival the patient said he must be in an insane asylum because he\r\nheard _spiritiques_ talking together. He, however, was “not insane”\r\nand began expounding his plans for revenge with the words “Kill,”\r\n“Cut-throat.”\r\n\r\nThis man had been placed in the auxiliary service by the Council,\r\ncalled to the colors December 13, 1914, and finally sent to the front\r\nin May, 1915. In July he was made prisoner in a brush. He said, “I\r\ncried out, ‘Comrades, what difference does it make to me whether I am\r\nGerman or French? My officers are imbeciles that drink the blood of us\r\nunlucky ones!’” He was interned in some camp whose name he could not\r\nexactly give and reported that the Germans were very gentle with him,\r\nthat his real enemies were the French, for the French were against\r\nhim night and day. “As a matter of fact, among Germans the French are\r\nnothing but _cochons malades_. The Germans are fine types.”\r\n\r\nHe was repatriated in May, 1916. He kept making verbose and neologistic\r\neulogia of the Germans. He had been a farm boy in Brittany, where he\r\nhad had headaches. He had been at Quimper Asylum in 1910. In fact, he\r\nsaid his parents had tried to poison him and to have him assassinated;\r\nthey had charged him with setting fire to their house. His mother was\r\nan imbecile, he said, who believed she was the Queen of France. His\r\nrecriminations did not stop short of himself. He had been accused of\r\nkissing a girl and stealing apples; as a matter of fact he knew what to\r\ndo with girls.\r\n\r\nHe had a coarse face and a number of stigmata besides his name\r\n_Agapithe_. He was kept at Villejuif as an imbecile.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfit for service: Question of feeblemindedness.\r\n\r\n=Case 49.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nWalter N. was declared unfit for military service in 1912, on the\r\nground of mental incapacity. He had shown this clearly during his\r\nperiod of training. He committed a number of slight offences secretly,\r\nbut not so secretly but that they were immediately discovered and\r\npunishment meted out therefor. He could do nothing without aid. It\r\nappears that his mental weakness had not been noticed in school, but\r\nthat his employers had thought him both feebleminded and irresponsible.\r\nNevertheless he always executed orders properly. While in hospital in\r\n1912, he had occupied himself very little, sitting indifferently, quiet\r\nand dreaming. At that time, he had shown poor calculating ability and\r\ndecreased power of perception. It also appears that he did not grasp\r\nthe nature of simple orders, the requisite associations being disturbed.\r\n\r\nDespite this history, on September 11, 1914, he found himself being\r\ntransported. He claimed to be very tired. Upon reaching the city,\r\nhe picked up a large stone and raised his arm as if to strike the\r\ntransport leader. While N. was being bound by the transport leader in\r\nconsequence, he kicked at his leader’s shins.\r\n\r\nIn the clinic he resisted examination, moving his legs without\r\nspeaking, staring at the floor, moaning frequently, sitting motionless\r\nwith head hanging, answering monotonously repeated questions, but\r\nturning his head at a loud noise. He felt ill. It appeared that he\r\nwas oriented and that his knowledge was well preserved although his\r\ncalculation ability was poor.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that psychiatric examination, possibly with the aid of\r\npsychological work, would have excluded Walter N. from the army.\r\n\r\n\r\nOniric delirium (Régis) in a somewhat feebleminded Esthonian.\r\n\r\n=Case 50.= (SOUKHANOFF, November, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn Esthonian, 21, a soldier in a reserve regiment, came to a\r\npsychiatric section towards the close of 1914. He was negativistic,\r\nmumbling, restless, fugacious; later more tranquil. One day he entered\r\nthe physician’s office, walking up and down, mute, looking at articles\r\nand attempting to take them away.\r\n\r\nFebruary 21, 1915, he was evacuated to the Notre Dame Hospital for the\r\ninsane at Petrograd,--a tall, healthy, agitated-looking youth with a\r\nrapid pulse. He explained in poor Russian how he was now among Germans\r\nand feared that they were going to hurt him. At first in the hospital\r\nhe was seclusive and morose. March 9 he became excited, and tried\r\nto break through the door. He was placed in the bath, agitated and\r\nyelling. An Esthonian interpreter did not quiet him. The Germans were\r\ngoing to make a martyr of him. After an hour of this he grew quieter,\r\nand next day complained only of head weakness and malaise, was in good\r\nhumour, smiling, and reading an Esthonian paper, and well behaved in\r\nchurch, though tired and pale.\r\n\r\nHe now got better, began to work and wrote letters. It seemed as if he\r\nhad waked up from a painful dream. He explained how he thought he had\r\nbeen in captivity; that he was going to be hanged. He had thought that\r\nthe Germans could talk Russian. He had had hard work in his regiment,\r\nas he did not understand Russian and had never before left his little\r\nvillage in Livonia. His mental disorder had started in the autumn,\r\nbut all that was now like a dream. He said that he had had a mental\r\ndisorder of short duration following some bodily disease, at the age of\r\nthirteen. According to Soukhanoff, this is a case of Meynert’s amentia,\r\nin a somewhat feebleminded person. The twilight state might well\r\nreceive (according to Soukhanoff) the term “oniric delirium” invented\r\nby Régis.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; burial: Incapacity to rationalize the situation.\r\n\r\n=Case 51.= (DUPRAT, October, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 39, a herdsman, was shell-shocked at Hill 304 May 23, 1916,\r\nburied twice, slightly wounded in right eye, and carried unconscious\r\nto Bar-le-Duc. He was then forty days in a semi-confusional state with\r\nheadaches and dreams of the Boches wanting to behead him. Some of these\r\ndreams came in the waking state, in which state he could recognize them\r\nas imaginary. In April, 1917, he said he had always been afraid, even\r\nin daytime, that he would be hurt and had been especially troubled by\r\nthe fear of shells. He was also bothered by nocturnal enuresis which\r\nmight become an incurable disease and bring impairment of memory and\r\nattention. Although not feebleminded the man was of but moderate\r\nintelligence, and his emotions, according to Duprat, were such as to\r\ndefeat any complete resolution of his plight by the intellect.\r\n\r\nAn affective complex, passing from the surprise of the shell-shock over\r\nto a fright based on clear though wrong ideas of what might happen to\r\nhim, had left him without sufficient power of _autocritique_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeakling, twice buried by shell explosions in one day: Change of\r\ncharacter; fear; three fugues (“It is stronger than I am”).\r\n\r\n=Case 52.= (PACTET and BONHOMME, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, Class of 1913, at the front from September, 1914, had a\r\nsomewhat infantile build physically but was intellectually of average\r\npowers, having been a type-setter (three years in a job). However, the\r\nconfined life had borne hard upon him and his father put him on a farm.\r\nHe passed through his military service successfully, though he was\r\ngiven two weeks in the guardhouse for overstaying Easter leave. He was\r\nsuggestible enough at this time to think that he would not be punished\r\nvery severely, since there were other men whose leaves did not expire\r\nat the same time as his own.\r\n\r\nHe was buried twice in the same morning, March, 1915, at Bois Le\r\nPrêtre, spent four or five days in hospital, and went back to his\r\nbattalion. But now there was a change in his character. Formerly\r\nindifferent to danger, he was now apprehensive every time he went to\r\nthe line and felt an almost irresistible impulse to make for the rear.\r\nHe was condemned to five years in prison, June, 1915, but was finally\r\nsent back to the front.\r\n\r\nHowever, in July he left his company a second time as it was going into\r\nthe trenches, and this time the captain simply asked him to do better.\r\nA third fugue, a few weeks later, sent him back to court-martial, and\r\nthence to be examined by alienists. He was perfectly conscious at the\r\ntime of the fugues and understood his duties and possible punishments.\r\nAll he would say was, “_It is stronger than I am._” Fear outweighed\r\nevery consideration after the episode of the shell burials.\r\n\r\nThe man may be regarded as a hypobulic, somewhat feebleminded person,\r\nable to get on in civil life but thrown out of gear by war. Of course,\r\nthe concept of fear as a disease can easily be overdone; however,\r\nhere was a case in which three desertions occurred; the third after\r\nsevere punishment. In the differential diagnosis, epilepsy, alcoholism,\r\nimpulsive poriomania, must be considered, as well as feeblemindedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. EPILEPTOSES\r\n\r\n(THE EPILEPTIC GROUP)\r\n\r\n\r\nDiagnosis “epilepsy” revised to neurosyphilis.\r\n\r\n=Case 53.= (HEWAT, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA Scotch soldier, in the Royal Navy, 43, was admitted to the Royal\r\nVictoria Hospital at Netley, as major epilepsy. He had been 12 years\r\na stoker, and 16 years before admission had suffered from syphilis, a\r\nchancre locally treated with black wash, without secondary rash.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Navy, he had worked in a fire-brigade and as dock\r\nlaborer. He had been very alcoholic when funds permitted, although\r\nnever “primed.” His first convulsive seizures came at 40, while working\r\nat the docks, following a night on which he had drunk a bottle of\r\nwhiskey. He thought he had been about half an hour in the fit.\r\n\r\nHe joined the A. S. C., January, 1915; served in France; later at\r\nSalonica. He had eight convulsive seizures, some in France, and others\r\nat Salonica, always after much rum.\r\n\r\nThe man was tall, powerfully built, without visceral disease, speech\r\ndefect, or other symptoms except that both pupils showed the typical\r\nArgyll-Robertson phenomenon. The deep reflexes of arms and lower legs\r\nwere increased. The superficial reflexes were diminished, and the\r\nWassermann reaction strongly positive. A seizure was observed by Hewat\r\nand the diagnosis of major epilepsy was revised. The diagnosis of\r\ncerebrospinal syphilis, non-paretic, was preferred to that of paresis\r\non account of the absence of all the ordinary symptoms of paresis and\r\nof tremor. It might be asked whether these fits were chiefly alcoholic\r\nin origin. However, the patient had two or three fits while in hospital\r\nduring a period of eight teetotal weeks. Hewat remarks that the case\r\nsuggests that the serum of any patient developing epileptiform seizures\r\nfor the first time say between 35 and 50 years of age, should be given\r\nthe Wassermann test.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyphilis may bring out epilepsy in a subject having taint.\r\n\r\n=Case 54.= (BONHOEFFER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man of 35 in the _Landwehr_ acquired syphilis some time in the summer\r\nof 1914. He was a good soldier, passed through several clashes, and was\r\npromoted to _Unteroffizier_.\r\n\r\nTo understand what followed it must be stated that he had been a\r\nbed-wetter to 11, had been practically a teetotaler (Bonhoeffer’s point\r\nis perhaps that otherwise epilepsy might have developed sooner?), and,\r\nwhen he did drink, vomited almost at once, and had amnesia for the\r\nperiod of drunkenness. His father drank. His sister had fits as a child.\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1915, the _Unteroffizier_ lost appetite, got headaches,\r\nand went to hospital for a time. Upon getting better, he was sent on\r\nservice to Berlin. In a Berlin hotel he had his first convulsions and\r\nunconsciousness, biting his tongue. He was confused for several days,\r\nand, when he had become clear, had a pronounced retrograde amnesia\r\ntogether with a tendency to fabricate a filling of events for the lost\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThis retrograde amnesia is uncommon in epilepsy and suggests organic\r\ndisease. No sign of such was found, or signs of the epileptic make-up.\r\nThe serum W. R. was negative. On the whole, Bonhoeffer regards the\r\nepilepsy as “reactive” to the syphilis, as a syphilogenic epilepsy.\r\n\r\nAlcoholism caused amnesia in this man in the same way as the syphilitic\r\nepilepsy now did.\r\n\r\n_Re_ epilepsy and syphilis, Bonhoeffer states that he has repeatedly\r\nseen syphilis giving no other symptoms than epilepsy develop in\r\nthe campaign. At the same time, Bonhoeffer does not find that the\r\nincubation period in paresis can be shortened by war factors; at all\r\nevents, by the exhaustion factor in war (see Case 25). It might be\r\nquestioned whether the above case (54) was not psychogenic; that is,\r\nwhether the syphilis did not act in combination with being sent to\r\nBerlin on service as a psychic factor. However, this epilepsy on the\r\nwhole seemed not psychogenic.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyphilis in a psychopathic subject. Convulsions 5 days after Dixmude.\r\n\r\n=Case 55.= (BONHOEFFER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in the reserves, 23, was, subsequently to his being brought\r\nto hospital, described by his wife as a rather over-sensitive fellow,\r\nwho could hardly look at blood and was meticulous about the household.\r\nHe had always been subject to headaches, especially after hard work.\r\nHowever, he had passed through his military training well in 1910, not\r\neven having been _bestraft_.\r\n\r\nHe began service in October and fought at Dixmude on the 19th. On\r\nthe 24th in the trench and while being carried back, he had several\r\nspells of pallor, falling stiff, and then having convulsions. Brought\r\nfinally to the Charité in Berlin, he had more spells of sudden pallor,\r\ncollapse with brief convulsions, tossings in bed, as well as absences,\r\npost-convulsive headaches, and mild bad humor.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous attacks several days apart in the first seven\r\nweeks. The patient was not of an “epileptic” disposition, though\r\nreadily dissatisfied and headachey.\r\n\r\nThe serum W. R. was positive. Treatment by mercurial inunctions. No\r\nfurther convulsions. Prognosis doubtful.\r\n\r\n_Re_ epilepsy and the war, during the first six months Bonhoeffer\r\nobserved 33 cases in the Charité Clinic in Berlin. Twenty of these 33\r\ncases, unlike Case 55, had attacks before the war, although ten of\r\nthese had become epileptic rather late, namely, after the period of\r\nactive military service, at ages from 22 to 27. The development of\r\nepilepsy like Case 55’s is not without frequent precedent.\r\n\r\nBonhoeffer states that aside from epilepsy directly due to brain\r\ninjury by shells, there has been no certain case in which we have the\r\nright to regard the war itself as the total cause of the epilepsy.\r\nSome, like Case 55, are of syphilitic origin. No subject with a severe\r\nlong-standing epilepsy has been able to get into the field, according\r\nto Bonhoeffer; when they do, they prove constitutional subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn epileptic imbecile, court-martialed.\r\n\r\n=Case 56.= (LAUTIER, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA Belgian soldier was condemned by court-martial February 27, 1915, to\r\nfive years imprisonment for leaving his post in the presence of the\r\nenemy. It seems that he was mounting guard with two of his comrades and\r\nall three left to eat as no food had been brought to them.\r\n\r\nA physician examined the Belgian soldier and declared him responsible,\r\nalthough a little sick. All three were condemned to imprisonment. The\r\nBelgian attracted attention in prison through crises of anxiety and\r\nagitation; he had terrible nightmares, seeing Germans in his cell and\r\nhearing gunshots. He was accordingly sent to a special infirmary of\r\nthe dépôt, whence July 24 to Sainte-Anne, July 26 to Villejuif. He\r\ntalked Flemish, hardly understanding French, and spoke slowly and with\r\ndifficulty. He hardly knew how to read or write. He had been a truckman.\r\n\r\nAt 18, this soldier, according to his own account, began to have\r\nnervous crises in which he fell, lost consciousness, bit his tongue,\r\nfoamed at the mouth and urinated involuntarily. The attacks were\r\nsomewhat rare. His father sent him in 1910 to Gheel where he stayed two\r\nyears. Returning home he helped his father in the trucking work.\r\n\r\nWhen the Germans came the family fled to France and, about the end of\r\n1914, he was put into the military service and sent to the front after\r\na very short period of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe man had followed the example of his two comrades without taking\r\nthe slightest thought. He did not understand the gravity of his act.\r\nHe was not remorseful, regretful or angry against his judges. He was\r\nwell oriented but quite indifferent. He was a tall, intelligent looking\r\nman with adherent lobules, slight facial asymmetry and evidence of\r\ntongue biting. He wrote like a child and read slowly, spelling out the\r\ncomplicated words. He was employed at various manual tasks during his\r\nsojourn at the asylum and had no epileptic attack. He was given over to\r\nthe Belgian military authorities October 5, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeizures in a feebleminded subject--psychogenic components.\r\n\r\n=Case 57.= (BONHOEFFER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA 21-year old tailor, unused to marching, went into the field in\r\nAugust. A month later, after a period of long standing, he was\r\nnauseated and fell in a faint. Upon waking, his fingers were stiff\r\nand he had pains in his legs. He got better in the reserve hospital\r\nand was sent back to the line. On the way he had a similar seizure,\r\nwith nausea and fainting. On the way back to Berlin, he had a seizure\r\nin the railway station, and was carried to the Charité Clinic. At the\r\nclinic he stated that he could feel an attack come on; that he first\r\nhad _Angst_ all over his body, and that it was hot inside of his head.\r\nLatterly he had been able to stop an attack by clenching his teeth,\r\nafter which the attack would not proceed except that all became black\r\nbefore his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe was observed for four weeks but no seizure appeared. He was\r\nsomatically negative; his Wassermann reaction was negative. There was\r\nnothing hysterical about his make-up; he was somewhat surly and of low\r\nmental grade. He was unwilling to walk alone for fear of attacks.\r\n\r\nAs to the heredity of this soldier nothing is known. He had been\r\nan illegitimate child; he was a sleep-walker in childhood; he had\r\nsometimes spoken out loudly in sleep as a boy. At school he had been\r\nsomewhat backward, fought readily with his mates, and often complained\r\nof dizziness and headaches. He could not stand smoking or drinking\r\nwell, getting drunk upon two glasses of beer. He had not held positions\r\nwell. He became a _pionier_ in 1914, working chiefly as a tailor.\r\n\r\nEarly in his time as a soldier he had obtained an ulcer of the glans,\r\nwhich had been excised and burned. There had been no secondary symptoms.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bonhoeffer, this is an example of a not infrequent\r\ncondition. Although the attack itself and the habitus of the patient\r\ndid not look hysterical, the manner in which the attacks repeated\r\nthemselves speaks for psychogenic components. Just as genuine\r\nhysterical attacks may be looked on as reactions to unpleasant\r\nsituations, so may these attacks. In fact, we are probably dealing\r\nwith an hysterical fixation of the symptoms of emotional fright like\r\nthose in the true hysterias following shell explosion. A great many of\r\nthe phenomena of Shell-shock, to use the English phrase, are not in\r\nand of themselves of a psychogenic nature, but they are, according to\r\nBonhoeffer, psychogenically liberated under the influence of unpleasant\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n_Re_ reactive epilepsies, Bonhoeffer considers that there is a group\r\nof reactive epilepsies in which the war process plays an important\r\npart. The prognosis of these cases ought to be relatively favorable. In\r\npoint of fact, Case 57, although a feebleminded subject, seems to have\r\nhad a relatively favorable prognosis: at all events, no new seizures\r\nappeared under prolonged medical observation. These reactive seizures\r\nmay occur in cases with a labile vasomotor system. They are, according\r\nto Bonhoeffer, aligned rather more with hysteria than with genuine\r\nepilepsy. Genuine epilepsy has not been developed in the war cases\r\nobserved by Bonhoeffer except where an endogenous factor was clearly\r\nin evidence; or else where there was the requisite antebellum soil for\r\nthe development of an epilepsy. In short, genuine epilepsies developing\r\nin the war are all, according to Bonhoeffer, predispositional. The\r\nantebellum soil was clearly in evidence in Case 57. Even before the\r\nwar, according to Bonhoeffer, many German soldiers during the period\r\nof military service gave evidence of their epileptic soil by sundry\r\nsuspicious phenomena. Among these were fainting spells during hard\r\ndrilling and other exercises, spells of enuresis, abnormally deep\r\nsleep, and even phenomena of somnambulism. One of the Bonhoeffer\r\nepileptics had been released during his reservist practice as unfit for\r\nmilitary service, and had only been put into the line at his own urgent\r\nrequest at the outbreak of the war. Three volunteers concealed their\r\nepileptic history. One man, who had had merely petit mal attacks before\r\nthe war, regarded them as of little consequence, entered the service,\r\nand developed epilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsibility of a drunken epileptic.\r\n\r\n=Case 58.= (JUQUELIER, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nThe question of responsibility arose in the case of a soldier who left\r\nhis camp the morning of October 23, 1916, and went to a neighboring\r\nplace, where he drank, with four others, two quarts of wine. At about\r\nthree o’clock in the afternoon, his captain met him on the street,\r\nlost, and looking drunk. He told him that he would send him to the\r\ntrenches in the evening. The man lay down and went to sleep. At about\r\nsix o’clock, it was found that he could not put on his equipment alone,\r\nand in fact threatened the other men with his bayonet, and then went\r\nto sleep. He woke up and explained that he had had one of his nervous\r\ncrises. He remembered the matter of the bayonet but had forgotten\r\neverything else about the struggle.\r\n\r\nThis soldier was 29 years old, the son of an alcoholic, and the ninth\r\nchild of a mother who died shortly after her tenth pregnancy. He had\r\nhad measles and bronchitis as a child, and in childhood had had bad\r\ndreams; at the age of ten he had swooning spells. He became a quarryman\r\nand a habitual drinker, subject to dyspepsia, nightmares, and nocturnal\r\ncramps. There had never been any crises, however, up to wartime.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1916, when a shell burst near him, the first sharply-defined\r\nepileptoid crisis came, and was followed by a number of others,\r\neither on leave or on service, March 8, June 2, and July 13. These\r\nattacks showed a sudden fall without warning, loss of consciousness,\r\nconvulsions, tongue biting, incontinence of urine, a period of more or\r\nless coördinate agitation at the time consciousness was reappearing,\r\nsometimes a fugue, and often amnesia for the whole. He had a scar on\r\nthe left border of the tongue.\r\n\r\nShould this epilepsy be regarded as entailing irresponsibility? He\r\nleft camp before the crisis, accordingly in a period when he was in\r\nfull possession of consciousness and will, and he had gotten into\r\nan irregular situation by drunkenness before his epileptic crisis\r\nstarted in. His struggle with his comrades, however, appears to be\r\na portion of a post-critical dazed state. The medicolegal decision,\r\ntherefore, was that he was guilty of leaving his command but not of\r\nthe other misdemeanor. Considering the general nature of epilepsy, the\r\nresponsibility of this man for the whole adventure is rather slight.\r\nThe Council, however, condemned the man to five years of labor, without\r\nadmitting that the crisis following so soon the actual misdemeanor\r\nshould argue a diminution of responsibility.\r\n\r\n_Re_ epilepsy in the army, Lépine notes the serious theoretical and\r\npractical problems to which it gives rise. In the first place, epilepsy\r\noccurs in the army more frequently than in the same number of men in\r\ncivilian life. Consequently, the diagnosis as to the really epileptic\r\nnature of the attacks observed is not too easy. Again, the situation\r\naffords much opportunity for simulation (see, for example, the case\r\nof sham fits (Case 78, Hurst), and the case of epileptoid attacks\r\ncontrollable by the will (Case 79 of Russell)). Wounds may produce it,\r\nand even wounds which do not affect the brain; besides which, a variety\r\nof war conditions, short of trauma, may produce it. When the ordinary\r\nimpulsiveness of the epileptic turns into automatism and to epileptic\r\nequivalents (_états seconds_), much of medicolegal interest may\r\nhappen. Case 58 was just short of a murderer. Cases of actual murder\r\nin epileptic equivalents have been known under military conditions.\r\nFugues with amnesia for the phenomena (which look to the military man\r\nlike intentional desertions) form another group of epileptic events;\r\nbut aside from the manias and the fugues, there are still more dubious\r\nepileptoid phenomena of a delusional and confusional nature, such that\r\nthe proof of epilepsy comes only afterward, when frank convulsions\r\nsupervene. _Re_ fugues and desertion (the most frequent of military\r\ndelinquencies according to Régis), we may think of the fugue reaction,\r\naccording to Lépine, as a natural reaction on the part of both the true\r\ndelinquent and the mentally sick subject. The loss of liberty, alcohol,\r\nfatigue, minor phenomena of _commotio cerebri_, may lead to states\r\nof mental depression that favor the fugue. It is an affair of the\r\ngreatest delicacy for the expert to build up again the exact plight of\r\nthe soldier at the time of his desertion. Special inquiry must be made\r\nof the man’s mates. Only in this way can the wheat be separated from\r\nthe chaff and punishment allotted to those only who deserve it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lépine, there are fewer guilty fugitives than there are\r\ninnocent ones, or at least partially innocent ones. In the decision,\r\none takes account of the duration, the course, and the peculiarities\r\nin the termination of the suspicious flight. According to the military\r\ncode, there are cases like Case 58 in which the fugue itself was\r\ncarried out in an unconscious state, and yet in which the martial\r\nresponsibility of the man was absolute. Drunkenness is no excuse for\r\nthe fugue, even if the latter is automatically carried out. Of course,\r\nthe paretic is not responsible for his fugue any more than the organic\r\ndement, the delirious uremic, or the chronic alcoholic, who is already\r\nseverely demented. For a case of this sort, see Case 1 (Briand).\r\n\r\nIn the differential diagnosis, we must also consider that fugues may be\r\ncarried out in confused states as well as at times in various paranoid\r\nstates, and even in melancholia.\r\n\r\n\r\nA disciplinary case: Epilepsy.\r\n\r\n=Case 59.= (PELLACANI, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA Milanese workman, 28, was exposed to the sun on sentry-go and had\r\nan attack of convulsions, on awaking from which he found himself in\r\nhospital. He always had attacks in reaction to emotion. One day, in a\r\nquarrel provoked by jealousy concerning a prostitute, he apparently\r\nlost his mind, whipped out a hunting-knife, and wounded a comrade.\r\nThereafter he lay unconscious until the next day. The court-martial\r\ndecided that he was not fully responsible.\r\n\r\nEventually, he was sent from the front for having insulted and\r\nstruck a superior officer. The report read also that he was a prey\r\nto delirium and had frothed at the mouth. In the interior he had\r\nconvulsive attacks, with falling and loss of consciousness. He told\r\nof arguing with a sergeant about a bicycle, of seeing darkness before\r\nhis eyes like a veil, and of subsequent amnesia. In hospital he had\r\nintense headaches at times, with spells of sullenness, hostility, and\r\ncomplaints concerning nurses and attendants and other patients. At\r\nother times, he was quiet and comfortable. One day he went into an\r\nexcitement and wept, asking to be sent back to the army, striking the\r\ntable with his fist and head. He then screamed, flew into a passion,\r\nand fell to the ground in semi-stupor, shaking his body and trying to\r\nkick and knock away those who intervened. He was placed in bed but\r\nremained agitated and unconscious, with anesthesia and frothing at the\r\nmouth. The abdominal and cremaster reflexes were absent in this attack,\r\nand the pupils were rigid and myotic. The pulse was rapid and the\r\nblood pressure high. Afterwards he was sleepy, stupid and weary, and\r\nshowed fine rapid tremors of hands, tongue, and eyelids. The abdominal\r\nreflexes now returned in excess, and a marked dermatographia developed.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, it was found that the patient’s father was also an\r\nepileptic and was alcoholic; that one paternal uncle had died in an\r\nasylum; another of apoplexy; that two maternal uncles were chronic\r\nalcoholics (one in an institution); that an alcoholic brother had been\r\nsix times convicted of assault and battery; that a sister had howling,\r\ncrying, and hair-pulling spells, throwing herself to the ground. The\r\npatient himself had had an early Bright’s disease and had always been\r\nan undisciplined, excitable, and impulsive boy, sometimes kept out of\r\nschool. His first conviction was at 18, for assaulting a policeman, and\r\nhe had been arrested four further times for assault and battery. He\r\nstated that his convulsive attacks with the veil before the eyes came\r\non when he was irritated or had taken cold, or had drunk to excess, or\r\nhad over-exerted himself. He said he suffered from intense headache,\r\nweariness, and sleepiness after an attack. He always bit his tongue at\r\nthe same period. Irritation and exertion sometimes caused attacks of\r\ndizziness and vertigo without unconsciousness. Alcoholism; ulcer in an\r\ninguinal gland. He had been confined in an asylum 40 days for epilepsy,\r\nattacks of which had become more frequent after he had heard of his\r\nfather’s death.\r\n\r\n_Re_ violence and epilepsy, Lépine remarks that a pure epilepsy\r\nunclouded by alcoholism may occasionally give rise to acts of extreme\r\nviolence, but these pure epileptic violences are infinitely rarer than\r\nthe alcoholic ones. The Milanese was in point of fact alcoholic, and\r\nin his ancestry were a number of alcoholics as well as epileptics.\r\nAccording to Lépine, when subjects are “out for blood,” they are almost\r\nalways either, like this Milanese, hereditary alcoholics, or else\r\nstrongly predisposed subjects, or even the offspring of the insane.\r\n\r\n\r\nA disciplinary case: Epileptic attacks with amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 60.= (PELLACANI, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA Veronese, 23, quarrelled with his comrades, and one day wounded one.\r\nAnother time, when reproved by a superior, he struck him with a shoe;\r\nand at still another time, hurled himself upon his superior officer and\r\nbore him to the ground. Yet he seemed to have a perfect amnesia for all\r\nthese violent acts. At other times, he had convulsive attacks with a\r\nmental state which seemed to combine anger and depression, after which\r\nhe would fall to the ground, lose consciousness, go into clonic spasms,\r\nspit bloody saliva, and cause wounds and abrasions upon his body. Once,\r\nafter such an attack, he passed into a brief excited spell. Finally\r\nhe was so insubordinate and violent to superior officers, that he was\r\nbrought under hospital observation, having been excited and confused\r\nfor a day.\r\n\r\nNext day he was lucid, oriented, and tranquil; entirely amnestic\r\nfor what happened the day before, though his acts were sufficiently\r\nunusual. He had threatened his superior officer and been reproved and\r\nsent to prison to think it over. In prison he had suddenly thrown\r\nhimself against another innocent person and clutched him tightly about\r\nthe neck. He threw another violently to the ground and then ran to help\r\nthe previous victim! Bound fast, he had succeeded in freeing himself\r\nand thrown himself furiously against the prison door, whereupon he had\r\nfallen to the ground in an epileptic fit. He had tachycardia (120) and\r\na generalized hypalgesia. The vasomotor reactions were excessive.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation it proved that his mother had been subnormal and\r\nthat the patient had been constitutionally excitable and unstable,\r\ngiven to attacks of anger and impulsiveness from youth up. In fact, he\r\nhad been in prison several times for violence. He described himself\r\nin his restless spells as feeling a trembling all over his body as if\r\nhis blood were boiling in his heart and his head, whereupon he would\r\nlose knowledge of what he was doing. He had been a quarrelsome boy,\r\npursuing his mates with knives and stones. Once, after arguing with\r\na car conductor, he had broken the car windows, turned everything\r\nupside-down, and thrown the conductor into the street.\r\n\r\nCase 60 is clearly in the same group as Case 59. The Veronese falls\r\ninto the same frame with the Milanese except that he appears not\r\nto have been alcoholic. The insubordinations of the Veronese were\r\napparently carried out in a state of unconsciousness. The majority of\r\ninsubordinates appear not to be epileptics. Some authors have called\r\nattention to pathological politeness as an occasional symptom in\r\nepilepsy. Perhaps the majority of insubordinate cases are feebleminded\r\nor schizophrenic.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesertion in epileptic fugue.\r\n\r\n=Case 61.= (VERGER, February, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA blacksmith from the Rochefort Arsenal, 27 (nothing known as to\r\ngrandparents; father, now in the fifties, for 30 years in an asylum\r\nwith frequent attacks of furor; mother, 45, well and apparently\r\nwell-balanced; brother with the colors, wounded and decorated with the\r\nmilitary medal; a cousin-german, who has had a typical epilepsy--in\r\nthe patient himself enuresis up to 13 or 14, later, less frequently;\r\napparently no tongue-biting; no information as to infectious diseases;\r\ngraduate from primary school, apprenticed to a blacksmith; an unskilful\r\nworker; never able to rise to the level of a _frappeur_), in 1909 had\r\npassed the board of review and been put in the sixth division of the\r\nline. Antebellum there was a history that one night at supper, he had\r\nslipped away from quarters and gone 30 kilometres, home. His astonished\r\nmother sent him back to the military post by railway.\r\n\r\nUpon the night of May 26-27, 1915, this soldier found himself in the\r\nposition of a sentry, opposite the enemy. He told his comrade that he\r\nhad to go away for a time, leaned his gun against a tree, disappeared,\r\nand did not return. It was then one o’clock in the morning. At six\r\no’clock, he was found two kilometres away from the lines, in a village.\r\nHe was in front of a barn where his company had been quartered before\r\ntaking possession of the advanced posts.\r\n\r\nHe was brought up before the military authorities; but upon stating\r\nthat in civil life he had wandered off several times without knowing\r\nwhere he was going, he was submitted to neurological examination.\r\nThere was available a letter from his family physician relative to his\r\nantebellum military service. It appeared that he had committed a number\r\nof breaches of discipline, and that he was regarded by the physicians\r\nas a _déséquilibré_. He had lived with his mother a very quiet and good\r\nlife; there was no history of sexual irregularity, and no history of\r\nillness except a slight catarrhal jaundice. He had frequently suffered\r\nfrom headaches; there had been slight attacks of vertigo of very brief\r\nduration. He had never fallen in these fits. From his story it was\r\nelicited that he had had absences; his comrades had noticed that he\r\nsometimes stopped stock-still with vague eyes, then shortly regained\r\nhis wits and continued upon his task. Sometimes he would not work\r\nwithout being able to explain why he went away. He would go off for a\r\nperiod and, upon coming to, discover that he had not eaten his meals.\r\nThere were never, however, any convulsive crises by day or night. He\r\nsometimes felt sick, and although there was no medical treatment, from\r\ntime to time he took bromides upon his own authority, saying he had\r\nbeen ordered to do so by his father. Although habitually of a gentle\r\ndemeanor, nevertheless he was subject to excessive anger upon slight\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nDuring the mobilizing and first months of the war, both in quarters and\r\nat the front, however, his conduct had been that of a good soldier.\r\nSuddenly, about March or April, 1915, the nocturnal enuresis began\r\nto be frequent again, occurring twice or three times a week; but the\r\npatient hid this misfortune as far as possible from his comrades. The\r\ncaptain thought he looked tired and depressed sometimes. Upon the\r\ndays following the nights with enuresis, there was intense headache\r\nand marked moral and physical depression. There was no proof of\r\nnocturnal convulsions, and it is very problematical whether there was\r\ntongue-biting.\r\n\r\nAnother odd feature was that the patient, who had been sober in civil\r\nlife, had become intoxicated several times after going into the\r\narmy. Physically, he was of low stature, but otherwise well built.\r\nNeurologically, he was entirely negative. There was no sign of venereal\r\ndisease. There were a few stigmata of degeneration; for instance, there\r\nwas very little hair upon the face, the ears were unequal in size, and\r\nthe teeth were somewhat anomalously set. Mentally, he was below par;\r\nfor instance, he could not add mentally two numbers of two digits.\r\n\r\nAs to his desertion, the patient says he does not know what he did;\r\nthat he learned of his act only from his comrades in the morning; that\r\nhe remembered having left his duty _pour aller satisfaire un besoin_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA specialist in escapes (epileptic fugues).\r\n\r\n=Case 62.= (LOGRE, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn epileptic fugue with recidivism is described by Logre. He described\r\nhimself as a specialist in escapes. As a schoolboy, he had practised\r\nescapes and run away without purpose, and without remembering fully\r\nwhat he had done. His father would bring him back to school. At first\r\nthey had punished him and then would pardon him. These escapades in\r\nhis work as a shoemaker caused him to lose various places, but he had\r\nbeen kept by one employer for a long time nevertheless. From 11 years\r\non, this patient had never ceased living either in foreign parts or in\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nThe fugues on military service began to multiply. The military chiefs\r\ndid not abide the escapades like the schoolmaster or the employer.\r\nEvery punishment he received had to do with some fugue. Three times\r\nhe gave himself up to the military authorities. Three times after a\r\nfew more days’ service or a week in prison, he left the barracks or\r\nescaped. There had never been any appeal throughout this history to an\r\nalienist. On the declaration of war, he had returned to Belgium and\r\nwas put into the army; whereupon in January, he carried out a fugue of\r\na few hours which was rewarded with eight days in prison. There was a\r\nfive-days fugue in July, whereupon he was taken before the council.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, these fugues seemed to have the classical features\r\nof epileptic fugues. They were sudden, unconscious, blindly automatic,\r\nalmost completely forgotten afterwards and of a stereotyped and\r\nrecidivistic nature. Most of the fugues had been preceded by a slight\r\nexcess in drinking. An investigation was made to see if there were any\r\nconvulsive antecedents; none were found. This mental epilepsy, then,\r\nit was thought, must be an isolated symptom, free from every motor\r\nsymptom. But his mother and one of his brothers had also shown a number\r\nof attacks of some sort of epilepsy. In all three cases there was\r\nimpulsivity, unconsciousness, absurdity, recidivism, and refractoriness\r\nto treatment. On these grounds the fugue was regarded as pathological\r\nand as epileptic probably. The patient himself thought that these\r\n_coups-de-tête_ and this mania for running away without knowing where,\r\nmade really a very ugly fault, particularly in a soldier.\r\n\r\n_Re_ such specialists in escapes as Case 62, Lépine speaks of a type of\r\nmilitary delinquent which he calls _Ceux qui sautent le mur_. Some of\r\nthe fugue subjects, as well as other types of imbalance can apparently\r\nbe held by no possible kind or degree of discipline. They jump any\r\nguardhouse or any other form of imprisonment through what amounts to\r\na wild instinct for liberty. In some cases, this instinct appears in\r\na relatively pure form; that is, without any combined tendency to\r\ndipsomania and without any sexual factor. Some of them are, in fact,\r\nvery good soldiers, especially in shock troops. They, in fact, belong\r\nto what one might call the good element among delinquents. In the\r\nFrench Army some of them have been old legionaries and have even been,\r\nas in Case 62, previously condemned for desertion. They form a curious\r\nminority among the wall jumpers. Wall-jumping makes, so to say, the\r\nentire pathological phenomenon, and the recidivism is a part of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nA disciplinary case: Epilepsy and other factors.\r\n\r\n=Case 63.= (CONSIGLIO, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian private in the artillery (father dead of general paresis)\r\nhad been a victim of infantile convulsions and of convulsions with loss\r\nof consciousness up to 18 (convulsions with shouts and violence in the\r\nstreets of Rome; had to be put in a straight-jacket at the municipal\r\nhospital).\r\n\r\nHe developed more convulsions during antisyphilitic treatment in the\r\nmilitary hospital. He was a very poor soldier, of the rough and violent\r\nsort, and after eight months of service had to be assigned to a special\r\ndisciplinary company, with which he remained for fifteen months. Here\r\nalso he was punished frequently, and was given a period of four months’\r\nimprisonment for refusal to obey the officers. Then for a period of\r\nseveral years he had no convulsions whatever.\r\n\r\nDuring the war he was given to alcoholism, and one day in June, 1916,\r\nhe struck an officer and ran away to arm himself. He was at this time\r\nobserved by psychiatrists and declared sane. He was regarded as an\r\nemotional and alcoholic epileptic but not as neurotic or psychopathic.\r\nHe was again placed in a special disciplinary corps.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the convulsions which this Italian developed during antisyphilitic\r\ntreatment, it would be interesting to know whether intravenous\r\ninjections were used. In case they were used, one might compare\r\nthe case of this Italian with Bonhoeffer’s volunteer who developed\r\nepileptic convulsions after antityphoid inoculation.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the insubordination and violence of this Italian, compare remarks\r\nof Lépine noted under Cases 59 and 60. _Re_ the “other factors,”\r\ncompare remarks of Bonhoeffer noted under Case 57.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn epileptic goes through Mons and two years fighting without symptoms.\r\nThen strange conduct with amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 64.= (HURST, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private, 26, epileptic from 11 to 18 (mother also epileptic) entered\r\nthe army at 20, attempted to commit suicide in 1912 (amnestic for this\r\nattempt), and went to France with the expeditionary force in August,\r\n1914. The retreat from Mons and further fighting caused no recurrence\r\nof the symptoms. September, 1916, he was in fact put in charge of eight\r\nmen doing guard duty. At this time he was able to get to bed only every\r\nother night. The charge of the telephone worried him, as he had never\r\nbefore been made to assume responsibility. After two months of this,\r\nhe was found one night arresting civilians without cause and driving\r\nthem before him with fixed bayonet. He was let off court-martial on the\r\nmedical evidence, and at hospital remained confused and suspicious.\r\nNovember 16, he was seen by a medical officer in a typical attack of\r\npetit mal. Of all this, on reaching England December 19, he had no\r\nrecollection, and was keen to return to duty.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the remarkable delay in the return of epilepsy to this soldier of\r\nMons, Bonhoeffer remarks that one of the epileptics observed by him at\r\nthe Charité Clinic had passed through nine battles, and another through\r\n18 battles before the first attack of epilepsy. Bonhoeffer regarded the\r\nstrenuous marching as a liberating factor of epilepsy in five cases,\r\nactual fighting in seven cases, shell explosions in two cases, and\r\nbullet wounds in three.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the apparently psychogenic factor in Hurst’s case (epilepsy coming\r\non after assumption of too great responsibilities), compare remarks of\r\nBonhoeffer under Case 57 concerning psychogenic factors. Sir George\r\nSavage has called attention to a form of functional epilepsy following\r\nshock or injury, in which recovery occurs after removal from the\r\nstrain, but in which there is a relapse if the men go back to duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherapeutic (antityphoid inoculation) epilepsy.\r\n\r\n=Case 65.= (BONHOEFFER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA volunteer without psychopathic signs except a slight stuttering, and\r\nwithout psychopathic history of any sort, went into service at 17.\r\nAfter he had been a short time in the field, a shell fragment injured\r\nhim in the upper part of the thigh. He lay up in hospital four weeks.\r\nHe then spent four weeks in the reserve.\r\n\r\nHe was then given antityphoid inoculation, and a half hour afterward\r\nhad epileptic convulsions. These appeared four times more during the\r\nnext fortnight, as a rule followed by a delirious excitement. No fever\r\nwas reported. After the fourth attack, he was transferred to the\r\nCharité Clinic.\r\n\r\nAt the clinic there were no attacks, and there was nothing epileptic to\r\ndiscern in the make-up of the patient. His nervous system was normal\r\nto examination. There was, however, one fact in the family history of\r\nnote, namely, that an older brother of the patient, 20 years of age,\r\nsuffered from convulsions.\r\n\r\nWhat is the relation of the antityphoid inoculation to the epilepsy?\r\nAccording to Bonhoeffer, we must not forget the family history even\r\nif we regard the inoculation as the liberating factor. Curiously\r\nenough, the shell injury did not itself serve apparently to bring out\r\nthe epilepsy. Bonhoeffer has seen three other instances of epileptic\r\nattacks or epileptoid phenomena following antityphoid inoculation.\r\nHowever, in the hundreds of thousands of inoculations, it is not to\r\nbe wondered at perhaps that there should be a number of instances of\r\nepileptic attacks. One was a man with severe epileptic taint; in the\r\nothers, there was a question of pathological intoxication.\r\n\r\n_Re_ antityphoid inoculations, a French observer--Paris--remarks that\r\nthese inoculations may occasionally start up the symptoms of general\r\nparesis. Compare in this connection also Case 63, in which a syphilitic\r\ndeveloped convulsions during antisyphilitic treatment. The psychogenic\r\nfactor of intravenous injection itself, with its possible effect upon\r\nglands of internal secretion, can hardly be distinguished from purely\r\nserological effects. Paris goes so far as to state that he regards it\r\nas imprudent to vaccinate a syphilitic subject. He thinks it might be\r\nbetter for a syphilitic subject to contract typhoid or paratyphoid\r\nfever than to run the risk of developing paresis. If the soldier\r\nhappened to be not only syphilitic but alcoholic, then the danger would\r\nbe larger. Possibly, however, both Bonhoeffer’s case of antityphoid\r\ninoculation epilepsy and the cases alluded to by Paris of antityphoid\r\ninoculation, are merely statistical accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; (apparently slight) scalp wound: Jacksonian seizures.\r\nOperation, decompressing the edematous upper Rolandic region. Recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 66.= (LERICHE, September, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Moroccan of the Seventh Tirailleurs was thrown to the ground by the\r\nexplosion very near him of a large calibre shell, lost consciousness,\r\nand woke up with a slight contusion of the right side of the head. The\r\ndate of this injury is unknown. He was evacuated to the interior, but\r\nstopped May 25, 1915, at the evacuation hospital because his pulse\r\nin the train stood at 51. An hour later in the hospital he had a\r\nJacksonian epileptic attack, followed by a left-sided flaccid, brachial\r\nmonoplegia, and after a quarter of an hour a second crisis, and then\r\na third,--a sort of epileptic status occupying an hour. The attack\r\nseemed to start in the left hand. After the crisis, hand and arm became\r\nflaccid and inert.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture in the crisis gave fluid under small tension in a few\r\nabsolutely limpid drops. The wound was a superficial skin wound as big\r\nas a 25-centime piece, near the middle line, roughly corresponding with\r\nthe upper Rolandic region. It was hardly a wound--a mild abrasion not\r\npassing the epidermis; periosteum and bone intact.\r\n\r\nThe patient was trephined and a thin layer of clot was found over the\r\ndura mater. The clot was removed and a crucial incision was made into\r\nthe dura mater. The brain seemed a little edematous, hemorrhagic and\r\nbruised. It soon began to beat and was tamponed.\r\n\r\nMay 26, complete brachial monoplegia without seizure.\r\n\r\nMay 27, seizure at 2 in the afternoon, starting in left arm.\r\n\r\nThe wound was going well and from this time forward no more seizures.\r\nMay 28, a cast was made for the hand.\r\n\r\nJune 4, lumbar puncture yielded a clear liquid under the pressure of\r\n58. That evening an hour after the puncture, the brachial monoplegia\r\ndisappeared. The arm was still a little weak June 5. June 8 the man was\r\nevacuated to the auxiliary hospital at Laversine. June 18, complete\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nFall and blow to head: Hysterical convulsions. Cure by studied neglect.\r\n\r\n=Case 67.= (CLARKE, July, 1916.)\r\n\r\nClarke had seen in the war but one case of hysterical convulsions,\r\nthough this particular patient had severe hystero-epileptic fits\r\noccurring in series. The man had never suffered from epilepsy and was\r\n20 years of age. He received a slight wound and fell back into the\r\ntrench a distance of six feet, striking but not contusing the back of\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nOn admission to the hospital he was found drowsy and dull. Fits\r\noccurred a week later, following one another at brief intervals in\r\nseries that lasted one or two hours. The arms would be raised and\r\nextended in clonic spasm; the patient would resist violently if held,\r\nand then turn to his right side with rigid extension of legs and back\r\nin opisthotonos. The eyeballs underwent irregular movements, and\r\nthere was a well marked hippus. Though the tongue was protruded in\r\nthese attacks, it was never bitten. It was doubtful whether there was\r\na complete loss of consciousness. Between attacks, the patient was\r\nmorose and sullen, and showed a varying incoördination of the movements\r\nof the left leg, which was anesthetic to the knee. There was also a\r\nglove anesthesia of the right forearm and hand. Fields of vision were\r\ncontracted.\r\n\r\nThe fits recurred with intervals of a day or two, for a fortnight. The\r\npatient was then strictly isolated in a small room with an observation\r\nwindow. His bed was made up on the floor. He then had very slight\r\nattacks, as a rule when the nurse came into the ward; no notice was\r\ntaken of these attacks and in a fortnight they ceased. The paresis\r\nof the leg and the anesthesia also cleared up without treatment. He\r\nremained in the general ward three weeks longer, at first dull and\r\nlistless, but later cheerful and active. Clarke suggests that this\r\npatient was below normal intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell injury with unconsciousness; delayed attacks of epilepsy:\r\nsuperposed hysterical hemihypesthesia. Previous history consistent with\r\nthe hypothesis that a genuine epilepsy had been developed.\r\n\r\n=Case 68.= (BONHOEFFER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn excellent soldier, of good build, 29 years, a member of the\r\n_Landwehr_, passed unscathed through eleven battles in the 1914\r\ncampaign, but finally succumbed to fragments of shell which struck his\r\nchest and the lower part of his thigh. He fell down, nauseated, and\r\nlost consciousness. He is said to have struck about him with his arm\r\nand to have voided urine. There was a second attack three weeks later,\r\nin which he fell upon his face.\r\n\r\nIn the Charité Clinic he had three attacks, two of them nocturnal, one\r\nin the daytime, followed by a long period of somnolence. He once cried\r\nout suddenly in the night as if warding off an attack. He complained of\r\nheadaches, and was often irritated and out of humor. Somatically, there\r\nwas a hemihypesthesia on the side of the injury.\r\n\r\nThe history indicates that this patient up to his sixteenth year had\r\nbeen a victim of occasional enuresis, often cried out in his sleep or\r\neven rose from bed. Occasionally he suffered from such violent sudden\r\nheadaches that he would have to sit down. He was easily irritated, and\r\nhad once been arrested for assault. As a soldier, however, he had never\r\nbeen guilty of any breach of discipline. Mild headaches would follow\r\ndrinking. These phenomena in the history pointed in the direction of\r\nepilepsy. According to Bonhoeffer, we cannot entirely exclude contusion\r\nof the brain from the shell injury. However, there were no cerebral\r\nsymptoms, and the interval before the occurrence of the attacks rather\r\nindicates that we are dealing with a genuine epilepsy. As for the\r\nhemihypesthesia, this is a hysterical “_superposition_,” which does\r\nnot interfere, according to Bonhoeffer, with the genuineness of the\r\nepilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-wound; musculocutaneous neuritis: Brown-Séquard’s epilepsy.\r\n\r\n=Case 69.= (MAIRET and PIÉRON, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 30, a gardener, was wounded in the right forearm by\r\na shell fragment, which fractured the ulna, September 7, 1914, at\r\nRevercourt. Despite much fragmentation of the bone and suppuration, the\r\nwound healed with two cicatrices, where the fragments had gone in and\r\nhad come out. The scarring process was over in December.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the middle of January, 1915, this man began to suffer from\r\nheadaches and insomnia, with vertigo and buzzing in the head, “as if\r\nan airplane inside.” Sometimes arms and legs would stiffen, and the\r\nman would tremble, have to lie down, and even lose consciousness for\r\na quarter of an hour, waking up tired, wandering, and with feelings\r\nin his head. These crises, at first occurring every week, later grew\r\nfrequent. Finally there was a very complete attack, in which he fell\r\nout of bed, got up, made several turns about the room, and went back to\r\nbed; and in the morning, was dull and disoriented. Accordingly, he was\r\nsent to the central military neuropsychiatric service of the general\r\nhospital at Montpellier, November 10.\r\n\r\nBesides the two extensive cicatrices, there were motor disorders.\r\nPronation and supination were almost impossible, as well as extension\r\nof the hand and fingers and abduction of the thumb. There was a radial\r\nparalysis without R. D. Electrical excitability of the extensors\r\nwas diminished on the right. The hand was weak. The right thumb was\r\natrophic. There was a hypertrichosis as well as redness, heat and\r\nperspiration of the right hand. There was a hypesthesia for all forms\r\nof stimulation in the hand, especially in the radial region; less in\r\nthe ulnar region. This hypesthesia rose along the posterior surface\r\nof the forearm and covered all the territory of the ulnar nerve;\r\nbut there was a corresponding hyperesthesia in the musculocutaneous\r\ndistribution, as well as in the internal cutaneous distribution. Above\r\nthe scar there was a region of complete anesthesia. The hyperesthesia\r\nrose higher along the circumflex nerve and the posterior branches of\r\nthe cervical nerves and included the great occipital distribution, even\r\ninvolving the superficial cervical plexus, though not the territory\r\nof the trigemini. There was some hyperesthesia of areas governed by a\r\nfew dorsal intercostal nerves. There were also spontaneous pains in\r\nthese hyperalgesic regions. The _musculocutaneous nerve_ could be felt\r\nto be _thick and swollen_, indicating a perineuritis. There were no\r\nneuropathic stigmata, but the knee-jerks were exaggerated a little more\r\non the right side.\r\n\r\nThe convulsions appeared two or three times a day, the pain would get\r\nworse along the arm, rise to the head, following the hyperesthetic\r\nzone, then invade the interior of the head, whereupon objects\r\nwould appear to turn and the ears would buzz. The right leg, and\r\nespecially the right arm, would begin to tremble. The man would have\r\nto support himself to avoid falling. He saw shadows moving, colored\r\ntrees, occasionally persons. When the vertigo got stronger, he lost\r\nconsciousness. The extremities of the right side stiffened and carried\r\non jerky movements. These sometimes extended to the left side. The\r\nseizure lasted from five to fifteen minutes, and sometimes occurred\r\nin the middle of the night. Fatigue followed but headache disappeared\r\nafter an attack.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of Brown-Séquard’s epilepsy was made. If the\r\nmusculocutaneous trunk was compressed, a crisis was produced with\r\npain radiating to the head, obscuration of vision, numbness in the\r\narm, and tremors. Electrical treatment was resorted to for analgesic\r\neffect. There was a certain improvement during May, so that the diurnal\r\ndizziness disappeared. May 19 he had a period of 24 hours without any\r\nvertigo. In June no further improvement occurred.\r\n\r\nAn operation was performed June 23, 1915. The two cicatrices were\r\nexcised, and some fragments of cloth were removed. Three Jacksonian\r\ncrises followed the operation, and there was another seizure next day.\r\nFrequent headaches followed without crises. More seizures appeared in\r\nthe night during July, and their frequency increased. Pains persisted\r\nalong the arm and in the back of the head; the musculocutaneous\r\nperineuritis was still intense. Prolonged baths for the arm were begun\r\nAugust 4, two baths of two hours each, at 40 deg. each day. Following\r\nAugust 10 there was an improvement, which stopped as soon as the baths\r\nwere omitted, with diminution of the vertigo and the hyperesthesia.\r\nThis improvement continued; the baths were made to last three hours.\r\nThere were no attacks from August 21 to 26 whereupon they then returned\r\nfor two days. The pains had much diminished in the arm but persisted in\r\nthe occiput. A few night attacks occurred August 30 and 31, September 5\r\nand 6, as well as September 19 and 20, 25 and 26, and 27.\r\n\r\nThe occipital pain had now become less; the musculocutaneous nerve\r\nwas not so large. Only a few headaches followed during the months\r\nof October, November, and December. After November 3 the baths were\r\nstopped and the arm was kept wrapped in a warm compress. There\r\nwas still a certain hyperesthesia, the knee-jerks had become less\r\nexaggerated. Massage and mechanotherapeutic exercises were begun. There\r\nwere no more attacks after September 27.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Brown-Séquard’s epilepsy, Lépine remarks that besides the case\r\nof Mairet and Piéron, Hurst and Souques have published cases. Lépine\r\nhimself has observed two cases: one followed a nerve wound in the\r\nfoot; another, a penetrating wound of the chest. As a rule, such\r\nBrown-Séquard epilepsies appear a number of months after trauma; as\r\na result of irritation in the scar. Lépine’s subjects were taken for\r\nsimulators because they had not received any _cranial_ wound. The\r\nprognosis should be guarded, though the outcome in Case 69 appears to\r\nhave been favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpileptic episode at 24 years following bullet-wound of hand, in a\r\nsoldier who had had convulsions in childhood (sister epileptic).\r\nReactive epilepsy? Epilepsia tarda?\r\n\r\n=Case 70.= (BONHOEFFER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man in the reserve, 24, bore the stresses of the war very well\r\nin the campaign in East Prussia until he was shot in the hand at\r\nDeutsch-Eylau. He had always been well aside from rheumatism, and was\r\ndischarged with a good record from his military service.\r\n\r\nSent to the reserve hospital for his hand injury, he had, two or three\r\ntimes in the night, convulsions with loss of consciousness and dilated\r\npupils; after which there was a thirty-six hour period of depression\r\nwith refusal of food. Thereafter this soldier had amnesia for both\r\nthe seizures and the subsequent depression. He was observed six weeks\r\nlonger in the Charité Clinic but had no more attacks, and indeed\r\nnothing more of note either mentally or somatically.\r\n\r\nThe history showed that there had been convulsions in the third and\r\nfourth years of the patient’s life. There had been, however, nothing\r\nepileptoid in the later childhood or developmental years of the\r\npatient. However, a sister of the patient had suffered since childhood\r\nfrom convulsions. It remains a question whether this episode is to be\r\nregarded as reactive epilepsy--reactive, namely, to experiences in the\r\nwar--or whether we are dealing with a true epilepsia tarda.\r\n\r\n_Re_ this episode following bullet wound, the compiler has placed\r\nit after Mairet and Piéron’s case of Brown-Séquard epilepsy, but\r\napparently Bonhoeffer regards his case as probably a reactive one.\r\nUnlike the case of Mairet and Piéron, Bonhoeffer’s case had an\r\nepileptic soil (convulsions in childhood and epileptic sister). _Re_\r\nthe so-called reactive epilepsies, see remarks by Bonhoeffer under Case\r\n57.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilepsia tarda in a lance-corporal without hereditary taint or\r\nprevious history save dizzy spells and excitability.\r\n\r\n=Case 71.= (BONHOEFFER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA reserve lance-corporal, 24 years--a soldier from 1911 to 1913\r\nwithout disciplinary record, and in his second year becoming\r\nlance-corporal--was in the campaigns in Belgium, East Prussia, and\r\nPoland, making long marches and going through several battles. In the\r\nmiddle of October, 1914, he fell from a horse and suffered a contusion\r\nof the thorax, after which blood appeared in the sputum. In November he\r\nwas brought to the reserve hospital in Berlin, and there had convulsive\r\nseizures. Before transfer to the Charité Clinic, a seizure occurred,\r\nand he was brought into the clinic in a characteristic dazed state.\r\nThereafter he was clear but often out of humor and irritated. Three\r\nweeks later came a brief attack, probably epileptic in nature, with\r\nrestless half-delirious sleep following.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in childhood or in the family history to indicate\r\nepilepsy. However, the patient himself stated that from 1913 onward,\r\nafter his period of military service, he had from time to time felt\r\nattacks of dizziness after exertion, and that he had become more easily\r\nexcitable than before.\r\n\r\nThe attacks in the lance-corporal are probably not to be attributed to\r\nthe thoracic contusion, according to Bonhoeffer, because of the long\r\nperiod that elapsed after the thoracic injury, and their development\r\nnocturnally without special occasion. According to Bonhoeffer, we are\r\nprobably here dealing with a late epilepsy.\r\n\r\n_Re_ late epilepsy, see also under Case 57. Bonhoeffer makes a\r\nconsiderable point of the lateness in attacks of epilepsy in some of\r\nthe military cases, pointing out their beginning at the ages of 22 to\r\n27 in the period of peace practice undergone by soldiers. The theory\r\nis that cases of severe and long-standing epilepsy are known to the\r\nauthorities, so that they would not ordinarily be in military service\r\nexcept under conditions of concealment or in case of error. The present\r\ncase (71) appears to be the nearest that Bonhoeffer has found to a case\r\nof epilepsy without heredity and without acquired soil. All that can be\r\nregarded as evidence of soil is the dizzy spells and excitability.\r\n\r\n_Re_ thoracic contusion, compare remarks of Lépine under Case 69, on\r\nBrown-Séquard epilepsy following thoracic wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nConvulsions by autosuggestion.\r\n\r\n=Case 72.= (HURST, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private, 27, is described as a typical martial misfit--in private\r\nlife a music hall falsetto singer, and afterward a valet. He joined\r\nthe army in 1915 and proceeded to France, and worked in a canteen.\r\nA week later, men broke in and threw a mallet at him, whereupon he\r\nimmediately had a fit, and was dazed, dumb, and unable to walk for two\r\ndays. Thereafter occasional further fits occurred, with nervousness\r\nand insomnia. He was sent home in September, 1916. Discharged to duty,\r\nhe again in December returned to France, had six fits in the first\r\nweek--three in hospital, two on the boat, and between two and four for\r\nfour days after admission. The diagnosis of genuine epilepsy was made\r\nin France by a medical officer who had seen one of the convulsions.\r\nHowever, he had never passed urine or bitten his tongue, had no family\r\nhistory, and had never had fits before going to France.\r\n\r\nHe was hypnotized and given the suggestion that he would have a fit.\r\nIn the convulsion which followed the plantar reflexes remained flexor,\r\nbut otherwise the convulsion was quite like the genuine epilepsy. He\r\nwas told that he would not have any more convulsions, nor did he have\r\nany more except on Feb. 16, 1917, when some talk was made to him about\r\nreturning to duty. Bromides used in France did not help the epilepsy\r\nat all. This patient developed a gait and speech defect copied from\r\ntwo patients in the wards. These symptoms, due to autosuggestion,\r\ndisappeared on persuasion.\r\n\r\n_Re_ autosuggestion, Bernheim has returned to the fray (1917) in a\r\nbook on automatism and suggestion, dealing only in small part with war\r\nproblems. The most general formula for suggestion appears to be that\r\nit is an _idea accepted_. A suggestion offered but not accepted is\r\nin effect not a suggestion at all. Any accepted idea, says Bernheim,\r\nis from the psychological point of view as well as from the medical\r\npoint of view, a suggestion. A suggestion may be direct or indirect,\r\nreasonable or unreasonable, brought about by\r\n\r\n(_a_) mere verbal assertion,\r\n\r\n(_b_) hypnotic state,\r\n\r\n(_c_) persuasive explanation, rational or emotional,\r\n\r\n(_d_) emotion (that is, emotion not the effect of any form of\r\nsuggestion offered by the physician, but emotion brought about by some\r\nevent affecting the sentiments of the subject).\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilepsy of emotional origin.\r\n\r\n=Case 73.= (WESTPHAL and HÜBNER, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant without neuropathic tendencies (except that his mother\r\nwas in a hospital for the insane) was under shell fire for some time.\r\nFinally, a shell burst near him, whereupon headaches and transient\r\nspells of confusion followed. Shortly upon the news of the death of\r\nhis Major, he had a spell of violent excitement and confusion, dancing\r\nabout on the ground and breaking things up. He passed into a stuporous\r\ncondition with a suggestion of catatonia. There were a few isolated\r\ndelusions to the effect that he was poisoned. After sleeping a long\r\ntime, he suddenly cleared up. There was an extensive amnesia covering\r\na period of weeks. He had forgotten the Major’s death and everything\r\nthereafter. He complained of headache, difficulty of thinking, and\r\nforgetfulness. An agoraphobia developed, as well as great sensitivity\r\nto sounds, and a feeling as if the bed and surrounding barracks were\r\nmoving. There were a few illusions of a visual nature. He had complete\r\ninsight into his condition. Conduct was normal. There was general\r\nhyperesthesia and ageusia.\r\n\r\nAccording to Westphal, this case of deep disorder of consciousness of\r\nsome duration in a healthy person is probably one of a dazed state\r\nfollowing the so-called “affect epilepsy.”\r\n\r\nIs Case 73 Shell-shock? Note that, in Case 73, the shell explosion\r\nat first occasioned mere headaches and confusional spells. The true\r\noccasion of the convulsions appears to have been the news of the death\r\nof a superior officer. It is, of course, possible that the transient\r\nspells of confusion were actually epileptic equivalents. Lépine\r\nremarks that Pierret and others, observing such spells of confusion\r\noften accompanied by agitation, have inquired whether manic depressive\r\npsychosis is not a kind of epilepsy. This question remains unresolved.\r\nThese phenomena of epilepsia larvata (see also Case 81 of Juquelier and\r\nQuellien) are to be sharply distinguished from attacks of confusion\r\noccurring in pronounced epileptics. These latter attacks often follow a\r\ncrisis and suggest exhaustion; sometimes they last several days.\r\n\r\n\r\nFatigue; fear; hysterical convulsions. Visual aura (approaching fire\r\nwheel) built up after the third crisis (scotoma after look at sun).\r\n\r\n=Case 74.= (LAIGNEL-LAVASTINE and FAY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA sapper, 23, with his company under heavy bombardment, October, 1916,\r\nwas overcome by weariness and fear (he had always been of a timorous\r\ndisposition). The order for the rear came, but the convoy was hardly en\r\nroute when the sapper felt a griping in the pit of the stomach and the\r\nblood going to his head; whereupon he lost consciousness and went into\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nThis incident seems to have made a powerful impression upon the\r\nsapper. A fortnight later, while working in the trenches, he had more\r\nepigastric sensations with vague discomfort. He thought about the\r\nearlier crisis and about his wounded comrades, and again fell down\r\nand had more convulsions lasting a quarter of an hour. The tongue may\r\nhave been slightly bitten in this seizure. In the genesis of this\r\nsecond seizure we may consider that the feeling of discomfort and the\r\nepigastric sensations served to recall the first seizure, so that\r\nthe second one may be regarded as due to autosuggestion--that is, as\r\nhysterical.\r\n\r\nA little later, on a hot day in the trench, while working, the sapper\r\nturned to a comrade and saw a great black spot on his face. He turned\r\ntoward another and saw another great black spot on this face also.\r\nHe was frightened, felt strange sensations, fell, and had a third\r\nconvulsive crisis. The black spots that he saw were due to a scotoma,\r\nthe result of a transient glance at the sun.\r\n\r\nAfter this scotomatous episode, his crises always had a visual aura.\r\nHe would feel rather uncomfortable, leave the supper table, feel a\r\ngastric sensation, warmth in the face, and oppression. He would go out\r\nin the cold for the air, look about for something, appear frightened,\r\nfix his gaze upon a certain point, and cease to reply to questions. His\r\nhead would jerk back suddenly, and he would utter strangled cries of\r\nfear. He was now evidently prey to a terrifying hallucination. In ten\r\nminutes, everything had gone again, leaving him trembling with emotion.\r\nHe would then relate how, after the epigastric sensation had begun,\r\nhe tried to see if he could make out something abnormal; whereupon a\r\nlittle fiery wheel would appear and roll up nearer and nearer, so as to\r\nalmost touch his eyelids. He could see his comrades to the right and to\r\nthe left of the wheel; he could hear questions but could not answer.\r\nJust as the fire wheel was about to blast him, consciousness was lost\r\nand the fits came on.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar strain; anxiety; confusion; fugue. Demotion and detail to the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\n=Case 75.= (BARAT, November, 1914.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant, 25, an officer in a regiment on active duty near the\r\nfront, was called before a special board charged with desertion in\r\nthe face of the enemy. He had been assigned to a certain position but\r\nnot only had not complied with the order, but had wandered off to the\r\nBritish sector and been arrested there as a spy.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was well developed, without stigmata; heredity, negative.\r\nHis career in the army had been courageous and he had been advanced\r\nseveral ranks and was about to be given a medal for bravery. He said\r\nthat he had been under a severe strain for several days.\r\n\r\nOne evening he had been given the order to attack. The artillery opened\r\nfire. He found that the Germans had erected barbed wire defences. The\r\nloss of men was terrific. His order was to shoot all who held back. A\r\npoor territorial crouched down and would not go forward--supplicating\r\nthe prisoner not to shoot him. The prisoner spared him.\r\n\r\nThe next night the order to attack the German trenches was again given.\r\nThis time he was overcome with anxiety and discouragement. The last\r\nhe remembers was the order to attack. Next day he felt sick and his\r\nmind was foggy. He remembered leaving his regiment and wandering round\r\nfor several days until he fell into the hands of the British and was\r\narrested. Then he understood what he had done.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner asked to be allowed to return to the front. The testimony\r\nof one of the lieutenant’s men verified his statements. On the day\r\nbefore he left the front he had been anxious, had cried often, and\r\nwould speak to no one. On the day he left the trenches without\r\npermission, he was nervous and disoriented.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that simulation could be ruled out; the differential\r\ndiagnosis lay between a “confused state of emotional origin” and an\r\n“epileptic dazed state.”\r\n\r\nFor epilepsy there was a history of attacks with falling to the ground\r\nand loss of consciousness, without involuntary micturition or biting of\r\ntongue, during the time when he was a sergeant. Moreover, irritability\r\nand unwarranted suspiciousness had been present at these periods.\r\nHowever, there were no other epileptic symptoms; these two attacks were\r\nisolated and of quite long duration, leaving no headache or malaise\r\nafter them. Also there was no basis for the diagnosis “epileptic\r\ndazed state,” since there was no abrupt commencement; the loss of\r\nconsciousness was never complete (the subject was able to converse with\r\npersons while the attacks were on); and some remembrance was present of\r\nincidents during the attacks.\r\n\r\nFor Barat, the important points are that the attacks were preceded by\r\nlong periods of anxiety and the disturbances resulted more from moral\r\nthan physiological causes.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the psychological factors lead the author and his\r\ncolleagues to the diagnosis “Mental confusion of emotional origin.”\r\n\r\nThe board decided to return him to the interior and give him a barracks\r\nposition at the reduced rank of drill sergeant.\r\n\r\n\r\nA solitary epileptic episode in an artillery officer (slight concussion\r\nof the brain two years before) following extraordinary campaign stress\r\n(38 artillery battles in two months).\r\n\r\n=Case 76.= (BONHOEFFER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA first lieutenant of artillery, 35, was able to count 38 artillery\r\nclashes in which he had taken part in two months of very strenuous,\r\nalmost daily fighting. Then appeared headaches, anxiety, dizzy\r\nfeelings, insomnia. Finally one day suddenly, after eating, the\r\nlieutenant sustained a loss of consciousness with convulsions, which\r\nsent him to his home reserve hospital. The officer had felt nothing\r\nbefore his convulsions came on. The medical report, however, yields no\r\ndoubt of the epileptic character of the attack.\r\n\r\nWhen he was examined, there was a slight psychopathic depression\r\nwith a feeling of insufficiency, anxiety, insomnia, restless dreams,\r\nover-sensitiveness, and a pessimistic outlook on the future. There were\r\nno epileptic traits whatever. There was nothing alcoholic, luetic, or\r\narteriosclerotic about the officer. There was nothing in the childhood\r\nor youth of the patient, though there had been a fall two years before,\r\nwith phenomena of concussion without sequelae. In fact, this fall with\r\nconcussion had led to no medical examination.\r\n\r\nAs to the relation of the concussion two years before to the epileptic\r\nattack, Bonhoeffer is inclined to interpret the case as one of genuine\r\n“reactive” epilepsy on the basis of continuous overstrenuous work for\r\na period of weeks. He regards the previous concussion as soil for this\r\nepilepsy.\r\n\r\n_Re_ amount of stress occasionally required to bring out epilepsy,\r\ncompare Hurst’s Cases 64 and 80. It may be recalled that Bonhoeffer\r\nis decidedly of the belief that exhaustion has not brought about\r\nany actual psychoses, calling attention to the remarkable absence\r\nof psychoses among the Serbians after their exhausting campaigns. A\r\ngeneral review of war experience indicates, according to Bonhoeffer,\r\nthe marked power of resistance of the healthy brain.\r\n\r\n\r\nNocturnal narcoleptic seizures accompanied by spells of somnolence in\r\nthe day, both to be regarded as due to the “brain fag” of trench life.\r\n\r\n=Case 77.= (FRIEDMANN, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA tradesman, 23, had been in the German infantry since the beginning\r\nof the war. Never sick, he had been, in a general way, nervous; and\r\na brother had had, at the age of 30 years, some sort of severe brain\r\ndisease, in which he became blind, dying a year later.\r\n\r\nThe man was for a long time in the trenches and proved himself a\r\ncourageous and stalwart soldier. He went to hospital after a slight\r\nbullet wound of the leg, with a benign paralysis of the peroneus.\r\n\r\nIn the hospital he began to show a somewhat pronounced emotional\r\ndepression, with a nervous tachycardia.\r\n\r\nFriedmann reports the case on account of certain peculiar seizures\r\nwhich, upon the man’s own story, had begun five weeks before, in\r\nthe field, although he had told no one about them. He had never\r\nfelt anything like them before. At first, they came three to five\r\ntimes almost every night. He would suddenly wake and find himself\r\nunable to move, to speak, or even to think. These seizures, however,\r\nwere not accompanied by any feeling of anxiety or any respiratory\r\ndistress. Consciousness remained clear, and after 10 or 15 seconds,\r\nhe could begin to think normally again. It was clearly a question of\r\npsychopathic absences of a mild narcoleptic type, occurring, however,\r\nonly at night.\r\n\r\nDaytimes, also, throughout the whole period in which the nocturnal\r\nabsences occurred, there were seizures of another description. During\r\nthe many hours in which he had to sit in the trench, about twice a\r\nday for half an hour long, he would plunge suddenly into a sort of\r\nirresistible lethargy. Without any external occasion whatever, there\r\nwould be a feeling of great fatigue. In the spell he could not move or\r\nthink, would lean his head upon his hand. He was unable to overcome the\r\nfeeling of weariness and became convinced that he was ill, and that\r\nthe fatigue could not be natural. However, he did his work like the\r\nrest. Friedmann interprets these spells as a kind of imperfect sleep.\r\n\r\nThe patient was physically healthy and stalwart, mentally not\r\nexcitable, and tolerably tranquil in the midst of shell fire. He would\r\nnever have been reported sick had it not been for his wound. Aside\r\nfrom the tachycardia, of which he himself complained little, nothing\r\nwrong was found in the hospital. There was, to be sure, a feeling of\r\ndiscomfort without any hysterical tinge, and sleep was restless. Aside\r\nfrom the peroneus palsy, the injury made a good recovery. The nocturnal\r\nattacks persisted; bromides and even luminal failed of effect. There\r\nwas, however, no longer any somnolence by day. In fact, for the five\r\nweeks of observation, there was no change in his condition.\r\n\r\nFriedmann states that mild emotional alterations are not infrequent in\r\nthe trenches with minds disposed thereto, although emotional shock,\r\nespecially in shell fire, is the most frequent cause. However, these\r\nparticular seizures are quite unusual. The stresses of field service\r\nlead to a sometimes complete paralysis of mental power, interfering\r\ntransiently with service. There is no evidence of sudden circulatory\r\ndisturbances such as would bring about dizziness, pallor, nausea,\r\nor fainting spells. According to Friedmann, the regulative brain\r\nfunctions, especially those that maintain consciousness, become weak\r\non account of a condition which he terms _Gehirnmüdigkeit_, or, as we\r\nshould say in English, brain fag. The situation forbids due completion\r\nof sleep. Thus, the explanation of the daytime attacks follows rather\r\nobvious lines of brain fag. The accidental awakening it is, which at\r\nnight produces the absences; the wakenings are due to the general\r\nrestlessness of the patient. The general weakening of cerebral function\r\nproduces the disorder at the moment of wakening, since the regulative\r\nfactors of consciousness are already out of order. The condition in\r\nthe absence rather closely resembles the state of consciousness just\r\nbefore going to sleep, and also perhaps the state of consciousness\r\nduring the process of awakening. It is as if the process of waking were\r\nsomehow delayed a few moments. Friedmann is interested to show the\r\nrelation of such absences to the so-called _gehäuften kleinen Anfälle_,\r\noriginally described by him in 1906 as occurring in children, and\r\ndistinguished from epileptic attacks. These attacks, after lasting for\r\nyears, finally disappeared completely. The same sort of thing in adults\r\nwas symptomatic of some other disease, such as neurasthenia, and was\r\nnot a true entity. In children these attacks failed to be attended with\r\nany mental injury, nor were there any pronounced epileptic phenomena.\r\nBromides had no effect upon them, and they already showed a somewhat\r\nstriking and peculiar appearance, involving interruptions ten seconds\r\nlong of capacity to think, speak, or move, without disturbance of\r\nconsciousness or automatic movements. Sometimes the attacks occurred\r\nfrom six to 100 times in the day, without in any respect interfering\r\nwith the general condition of the child. The occurrence of such series\r\nof mild seizures is nothing but a syndrome. To be sure, some cases\r\nturn out to be cases of genuine epilepsy with an eventual degenerative\r\nprocess. Some forms belong in the spasmophilia group, and some among\r\nthe hysterias. However, according to Friedmann, there is a narcoleptic\r\n_petit mal_ that is an entity by itself, proceeding after a period\r\nof years to complete recovery without complications. It is this form\r\nwhich may be regarded as a peculiar kind of brain fag. The case of the\r\nsoldier may be supposed to be one which will prove to have this benign\r\noutcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nSham fits.\r\n\r\n=Case 78.= (HURST, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn unwilling conscript developed numerous fits on board ship coming\r\nfrom Jersey, three days after enlisting. _Fifty_ more developed during\r\ntwo days in hospital. He was sent to Netley.\r\n\r\nOn the hypothesis of hysteria or malingering, he was hypnotized. A fit\r\nwas suggested to him, but did not come off. The Sister was informed\r\nin the patient’s hearing that the man was clearly shamming, as in all\r\ngenuine cases a fit would occur after this treatment. A fit with marked\r\nopisthotonos immediately occurred. This fit immediately stopped when he\r\nwas ordered to stop it and to wake up.\r\n\r\nThe man after waking promised to have no more fits.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpileptoid attacks, controllable by will.\r\n\r\n=Case 79.= (RUSSEL, August, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man was received in No. 3, General Hospital: Diagnosis, epilepsy. He\r\nwas shortly sent to the convalescent camp and then returned, having had\r\ntwo attacks. Russel watched for another attack, felt it was not genuine\r\nand “put the situation up to” the soldier whose story was as follows:\r\nHe had been at the front without leave for twelve months since the\r\nGerman retreat. Leave was due him. A sister’s letter said his brother\r\nwas severely wounded and his mother was praying for his return. When he\r\nthought these things over an attack came. He could, however, control\r\nthe attacks. Russel told him, if he would play the game, he would be\r\nsent to the base with a recommendation for leave. In ten days the man\r\nwas remarkably changed and had no further attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nHereditary epileptic taint brought out by two years service with\r\neventual shell-shock and burial thrice in one day.\r\n\r\n=Case 80.= (HURST, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private, 24, in the army from 16, never epileptic (sisters\r\nepileptic), was wounded four times in the war from September, 1914.\r\nShell fire did not worry the man, but he gradually became depressed\r\nafter his father and five brothers had died in active service. He\r\nwas blown up and buried three times in one day in July, 1916. He was\r\nunconscious for two hours after the second blowing up, but carried on\r\nfor two hours more until blown up for the third time.\r\n\r\nAfter this, he became nervous and shaky, and began to sleep badly, and\r\na month later had a typical attack of major epilepsy. Fits occurred\r\nwith increasing frequency. As many as 19 occurred in a single day. Rest\r\nand bromides caused the fits to cease, and there had been none for six\r\nweeks at the time of his discharge.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the extraordinary delay in the bringing out of this epileptic’s\r\ntaint, refer back to Case 76 of Bonhoeffer, with its discussion, and to\r\nanother case of Hurst (64).\r\n\r\n_Re_ Shell-shock and its relations to epilepsy, see below, discussion\r\nunder Cases 82-84 of Ballard, who has erected a theory of Shell-shock\r\nas in some sense epileptic.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Epilepsia larvata.\r\n\r\n=Case 81.= (JUQUELIER and QUELLIEN, May, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 29 (father alcoholic, died in hospital for the insane),\r\na decorative painter without plumbic history, non-alcoholic,\r\nnon-syphilitic, was wounded once, September, 1914, but returned to the\r\nfront in 1915.\r\n\r\nMay, 1915, a shell burst near him. He lost consciousness, regained it a\r\nfew days later at Brest, and was so far recovered that he could go on\r\nleave in seven days. While on leave, he had short attacks of delirium,\r\nfollowed by a total amnesia; there was, however, no crisis, fall, or\r\nconvulsion. After the first attack, he had for 24 hours malaise and\r\nheadache, but got well and went back to his dépôt. Shortly afterward\r\nmore attacks of this sort recurred, and he went to hospital and thence\r\nto the neurological centre at Tours. Whence, August 9, 1915, he got a\r\ntwo-months’ leave for “mental disorder post-confusional, _second état_,\r\nprobably hysterical (_commotio cerebri_), and organic hemiparesis.”\r\n\r\nNovember, 1915, after returning to the dépôt, there were more spells\r\nand he went again to hospital. Invalided December, 1915, he passed a\r\nyear at home, but the spells continued. Although the epileptic nature\r\nof these attacks was maintained by Francais at Évreux, he was placed in\r\nthe auxiliaries, December, 1916, but had to go to hospital almost at\r\nonce, and, February 28, 1917, entered the neurological centre of the\r\n9th Region for the second time. Here, when called to be examined two\r\ndays after admission, he was observed in an attack. He suddenly rose\r\nfrom the bench, made a few steps, seemed to be listening and anxious,\r\nas if he ought to be on guard. He looked up, seemed to be looking for\r\nsomething whose noise was approaching, lowered his head, made a slight\r\njerking movement, and said, “Poum!” as if to express the noise of an\r\nexplosion. He took a few more steps, the same movements were repeated,\r\nand the same “Poum!” was uttered. This lasted for about a quarter of\r\nan hour, during which the patient was unaware of his surroundings. He\r\ncould be guided all about the hall without resistance, but did not\r\nrespond to orders, commands, noises, or contact. In short, the patient\r\nwas in the midst of a hallucinatory dream at his post in the trenches,\r\nundergoing a bombardment. He was placed in a chair; remained motionless\r\nfor a few seconds, woke up, and answered questions. “Where am I? Oh,\r\nyes; I must have been sick because my head feels bad.” In answer to\r\nthe question. “What did you see; what was there?”, he said, “I don’t\r\nremember anything. I never remember. I don’t know.” The patient was\r\ndull and weak after the spell.\r\n\r\nThese spells varied in number but occurred once a week. The patient was\r\nable to tell of certain attacks that had occurred while he was out of\r\ndoors at home.\r\n\r\nNow and then, there was another theme in the hallucinatory delirium,\r\nnamely, a pencil drawing of a woman’s picture, of no great artistic\r\nworth but carefully done, at which the patient was much astonished on\r\nawaking.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if auto- and hetero-suggestion can be eliminated from the\r\ngenesis of these attacks. Neither hysterical nor epileptic crises have\r\npreceded or ever alternated with these seizures. Nevertheless, on the\r\norganic side, the patient had a general increase of tendon reflexes on\r\nthe left side, most marked in the knee-jerk, and fell to the left in\r\nvoltaic vertigo. There was a left hemiparesis, apparently of organic\r\norigin, which had been determined as far back as July, 1915.\r\n\r\nThere was no true dementia. Past memories were but slowly recalled,\r\nand inattention interfered with the fixation of recent memory. He\r\ncomplained of troubles in his sleep and dreamed of war experiences\r\nsomewhat analogous to those in his attack of amnestic delirium. After\r\nthe seizure, there was a marked hebetude and mental inactivity, torpor,\r\nand a severe headache. The case was presented to a special commission\r\nas one of epilepsia larvata in a person hereditarily predisposed who\r\nhad never before presented epileptic signs, suffering from a disease\r\ncharacterized by frequent short attacks of hallucinatory and delirious\r\nautomatism, following shell explosion which had at the same time\r\nproduced a slight left-sided hemiparesis and mental inhibition.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate an epileptic theory of Shell-shock; three cases:\r\n\r\n    1. Fugue; minor symptoms: later, epilepsy.\r\n\r\n    2. Epileptic confusion eight months after explosion.\r\n\r\n    3. Mine explosion: stammering replaced by mutism; mutism\r\n    replaced by epilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Case 82.= (BALLARD, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAtmospheric concussion from shell explosion, October, 1915, was\r\nfollowed by unconsciousness in a soldier described by Ballard.\r\n\r\nBlindness for a month followed recovery of consciousness.\r\n“Neurasthenia” (anxiety neurosis) after return of sight. Apparently\r\nnearly complete recovery after latent period of a few weeks. Return of\r\nblindness in one eye in December. Five days automatic wandering (the\r\nman was found in a west country town five days after leaving home to\r\nrejoin his dépôt and seen by a medical officer who reported that he\r\nwas dazed and amnestic for that period); admission to second Eastern\r\nGeneral Hospital, December 15.\r\n\r\nOn admission he proved to be suffering from minor hysterical symptoms\r\nsuch as an inability to open his eyes and to see clearly when the\r\nlids were raised. The symptoms rapidly cleared up under suggestive\r\nconversation and did not return except for amnesia and slight emotional\r\ndepression. He remained well until December 25. On that day he began\r\nfor the first time to have definite epileptic fits and nocturnal\r\nepileptic delirium. In January he was discharged as an epileptic. There\r\nwas no epileptic temperament or feeblemindedness. Finally, there had\r\nnever been any personal or family neuropathic or psychopathic history.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Case 83.= (BALLARD, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was blown up, April, 1915, and had a spell of\r\nunconsciousness. Later, pains in the head, slight amnesia and a\r\ncondition of asthenia developed.\r\n\r\nHe was eventually admitted to the second Eastern General Hospital at\r\nBrighton, January, 1916. At the time of admission he was semiconscious,\r\nstuporous, confused, disoriented, anxious in a dull sort of way,\r\ntalking about his expectation of “a sailor with a card.” Speech was\r\nintelligible, though fragmentary and infrequent. The man obeyed\r\ncommands but gave no replies to questions. The mental processes were\r\nslow and impaired.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ballard, we have here a case of epileptic confusion, eight\r\nmonths after the initial concussion. This particular attack ceased\r\nthree days later, leaving amnesia for the attack and a certain amount\r\nof mental retardation. The man was not epileptic in temperament and his\r\npersonal and family history proved negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Case 84.= (BALLARD, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was buried in a mine explosion, October, 1915, and for\r\nseveral days thereafter was unconscious or semi-conscious. He emerged\r\ndeaf and subject to stammering and a condition termed “neurasthenic.”\r\nThe stammering was soon replaced by mutism, which lasted several weeks.\r\nThe mutism was then supplanted by epileptic fits.\r\n\r\nHe was observed by Ballard in a dreamlike, disoriented and inaccessible\r\nstate, in which he was anesthetic to pin pricks, lay awestruck, dumbly\r\nfollowing with his finger hallucinatory airplanes. Flexibilitas cerea\r\nwas also shown at this time.\r\n\r\nNext day he emerged from the dreamlike state with mental processes\r\nsomewhat slowed, disorientation for time, amnesia for the attack,\r\nmemory disturbance and a return of the stammer. On the next day\r\nfollowing, all these symptoms had disappeared except amnesia for the\r\nattack. Another spell of epileptic fits occurred later. It seems that\r\nthe man had had a convulsion thirteen years before and occasional\r\nconvulsions since. In fact, he, seven years before, had had what\r\nwas called “a stroke” and residuals of a slight hemiplegia were\r\nstill present. (There is no statement in the case report relative to\r\nsyphilis.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotion; shell fire: Epileptic equivalents.\r\n\r\n=Case 85.= (MOTT, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man, 19, suffered from shock due to emotional stress and shell fire.\r\nHe had terrifying dreams. After a short time, he developed paroxysmal\r\nattacks of maniacal excitement. Just before the first attack he had\r\nbeen helping in the kitchen, lay down on his bed, went to sleep, woke,\r\nstartled, flushed, and sweating, and made for the door as if terrified.\r\nHe remained in this state as if suffering from hallucinations of sight\r\nand hearing, and without ability to recognize his wife, the doctors, or\r\nthe Sisters. When two strangers in uniform came in to observe him, the\r\nadjutant became violent, as if the uniforms had started terror anew.\r\nThe attacks lasted from a few hours to a few days, coming on suddenly,\r\nwithout apparent cause. One day he tried to get over the wall of the\r\nplayground. He came back and buried his head in his hands. Major Mott\r\nspoke to him, whereupon he got up, looking terrified, made for the\r\ndoor, and four orderlies were required for his restraint. At Napsbury\r\nHospital, to which he was sent, he made a complete recovery.\r\n\r\nMott suggests that we are dealing with a psychic equivalent of epilepsy.\r\n\r\n_Re_ epileptic equivalents, compare notes from Lépine under 58 and 59.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. PHARMACOPSYCHOSES\r\n\r\n(THE ALCOHOL, DRUG, AND POISON GROUP)\r\n\r\n\r\nPathological intoxication.\r\n\r\n=Case 86.= (BOUCHEROT, 1915-6.)\r\n\r\nA Territorial infantryman, aged 37, was in the habit of drinking a good\r\ndeal without getting drunk, and at the front drank a good deal of bad\r\nbrandy. He had just taken a considerable quantity when his regiment got\r\nthe order to charge. The charge was hardly over when the man became\r\ngreatly excited and hallucinated. He thought he was surrounded by\r\nGermans and tried to transfix his comrades with the bayonet. Howling\r\nand struggling he was carried to the rear.\r\n\r\nHe was soon brought to the asylum at Fleury after howling all night\r\nand seeing the Boches and animals fighting among themselves. His hands\r\nand tongue were tremulous and there were cramps in the calves of his\r\nlegs. On the 6th he expressed astonishment to find himself in hospital\r\nand was found to have but slight memory of what had happened. He\r\nremembered, however, that he had tried to kill his comrades. With the\r\ndeprivation of alcohol he became rapidly normal and was sent back to\r\nthe dépôt in a few days.\r\n\r\n_Re_ alcoholism under army conditions, Lépine remarks that alcohol\r\nhas played in this war a rôle analogous to that of malaria in the\r\nepidemiology of some countries. Many of the victims are, to start with,\r\nunbalanced subjects and _détraqués_ who are hereditary alcoholics.\r\nAlcoholism, according to Lépine, dominates the pathology of the\r\ninterior and has a marked bearing upon conditions at the front. In\r\nfact, alcoholism would have been disastrous in France had not measures\r\nbeen taken against it; measures still insufficient (1917). More than\r\none-third of 6000 cases studied by Lépine during three years have\r\nshown alcohol as a sole or, at all events, principal cause of the\r\ndifficulty. It would be within reason to state, according to Lépine,\r\nthat if we throw in cases in which alcoholism was a partial factor,\r\nmore than half, or even more than two-thirds, of the mental cases\r\nhad been strongly influenced by alcohol. Lépine thinks there may be\r\neffects like those of anaphylaxis. Certainly, the startling and sudden\r\neffects in so-called pathological intoxication, as in Case 86, suggest\r\nthe critical and vehement effects seen in the sensitized anaphylactic\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n                                CHART 4\r\n\r\n                  PHASES OF WAR PSYCHIATRY IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n      I. Antebellum phase of PSYCHIATRIC NEGLECT: Groundless fear\r\n         that recruiting would be disorganized by psychiatric\r\n         sifting processes.\r\n\r\n     II. Phase of ALCOHOLISM OF MOBILIZATION: Hospitals unprepared.\r\n\r\n    III. Phase of the MARNE: Alcoholism restrained by law;\r\n         psychoses few; psychiatrists optimistic.\r\n\r\n     IV. Phase of TRENCH WARFARE: Overemotionality; and of HIGH\r\n         EXPLOSIVES (January, 1915); now psychiatric services were\r\n         systematically established along evacuation lines.\r\n\r\n      V. Phase of SYSTEMATIC WAR PSYCHIATRY: Filterwise system of\r\n         management (_a_) near trenches, (_b_) in main body of\r\n         army, (_c_) on evacuation lines, (_d_) special hospitals.\r\n\r\n                              Chiefly from data of Chavigny, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathological intoxication: criminal prosecution stopped.\r\n\r\n=Case 87.= (LOEWY, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn orderly, in private life a teacher, one day about _noon-time_, when\r\ngoing on duty, called the commanding officer to account because he (the\r\norderly) had had to wait. He said he had been ordered to come at _two_\r\no’clock and it was already long thereafter! He was severely reprimanded\r\nbut addressed a number of the officers present with questions having\r\nno relation to military service. In fact, he seemed to have forgotten\r\nentirely that he was on military service.\r\n\r\nThis was the more remarkable as the teacher-orderly had many times\r\ndistinguished himself upon dangerous patrol expeditions and in critical\r\nsituations, winning the confidence of his superiors and the likelihood\r\nof promotion to corporal. He had been a discreet, earnest, and clever\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nLoewy observed him during this affair and noticed that he did not\r\nby language or movement suggest intoxication or hilarity but merely\r\na certain excitement. He was entirely oriented for time, place and\r\nperson, and his outward behavior was correct enough except for his\r\nmilitary rank.\r\n\r\nSent to his quarters near by, he gave the impression to his immediate\r\nsuperior officer of deep drunkenness. He murmured something and soon\r\nfell into a deep sleep. After waking, he had an almost complete\r\namnesia, knowing only that something disagreeable had transpired. He\r\nremembered that he had been offered several little glasses of cognac\r\nbrandy by a comrade, and that he had drained them off quickly before\r\ngoing on duty. He said that he had never drunk cognac before, and in\r\nfact had drunk nothing for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of pathological intoxication was made, and the soldier\r\nwas thereby cleared of his dangerous situation; a criminal prosecution\r\nwas not instituted. He thereafter behaved with entire sobriety and\r\nmodesty, and he achieved his corporalcy and later became file leader.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesertion in alcoholism may deserve the term “pathological.” Case of\r\nfugue.\r\n\r\n=Case 88.= (LOGRE, July, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA “deserter” said: “I went because I drank a glass. I just went,\r\n_comme ça_, without any motive.” He was somewhat feebleminded and,\r\nin explaining the impulsivity of his act, he added: “I went like a\r\nbroken-down beast. I walked straight ahead, without knowing where I was\r\ngoing and if I had been going to be killed, it would have been all the\r\nsame to me.” He could not that afternoon remember very well; but next\r\nmorning, after having slept, he regained full consciousness. He said\r\nthat he then found himself in a field near a cemetery. He had carried\r\nhis gun and equipment with him, but had lost them somewhere, and from\r\na military point of view, his desertion was complicated by loss of\r\neffects. On coming to, he said to himself, “Where am I? How foolish\r\nafter fifteen months in the line! Probably I have deserted again.”\r\nIn fact, he had a month before left his post under exactly the same\r\nconditions in the midst of a period of alcoholic excitement.\r\n\r\nThis alcoholic fugue is typical: drunkenness, impulsive and\r\nsubconscious ambulatory automatism, with partial amnesia,\r\ndisorientation, with mislaying of objects, followed by sleep and\r\nimmediate return to normality.\r\n\r\n_Re_ fugue, see discussion under Cases 58 and 59. The French military\r\ncode cannot excuse victims of fugue even though executed in a quite\r\nunconscious state, if the fugue is due to alcohol. There was a certain\r\nprocursive suggestion in the fugue of Case 88, who went “like a\r\nbroken-down beast,” straight ahead, without knowing where he was going.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlcoholism: Amnesia experimentally reproduced.\r\n\r\n=Case 89.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nFebruary 15, 1915, a German soldier drank beer in the canteen and at\r\nroll-call appeared tipsy. He then went to bed, but rose an hour later\r\nto go to town. A quarter of an hour later, he went to a clerk’s house\r\nand asked for paper, on the ground that the next day he was going to\r\nmarch to Warsaw. The clerk gave him no paper, which he then tried to\r\nget by force. A policeman arrested him and he said, “You just wait,\r\nlame dog!” Upon examination he denied that he had ever been guilty\r\nof any crime but had been in institutions on account of delirium. In\r\npoint of fact, this man had grown up in very bad surroundings, amongst\r\nquarrels and disputes of his parents, who kept a disorderly house. At\r\n19 he had been convicted of incest. He finally admitted having been\r\nconvicted for rape. It was found that he had once run out into the\r\nfront trenches; had been removed by an advance guard to a stable,\r\nand then wondered why he was not in school. He described a number of\r\nattacks of delirium although he had not drunk more than moderately.\r\n\r\nHe was given an experimental dose of 50 c.c. of alcohol, and in ten\r\nminutes became excited, tried to get out of bed, attacked other\r\npatients without reason, and was able to speak neither spontaneously\r\nnor in response to questions. In a period of two hours he became clear\r\nand asked what the trouble was. He knew only that he had taken alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the experimental excitement produced in Kastan’s case by the\r\nexhibition of alcohol, it is of note that Bérard has been much\r\nimpressed by the agitation that surgical cases of alcoholism undergo\r\nwhen anesthetized. It may be that the anesthetics act similarly to the\r\nexperimental alcoholism of Kastan’s case. According to Bérard, these\r\nphenomena of the anesthetized wounded (who are men recently evacuated\r\nfrom the front and other hospital cases) are of larval alcoholism\r\nbrought out by the anesthesia. Bérard wonders whether rum issues at the\r\nfront are at all responsible therefor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesertion, drunk. Contributory factors.\r\n\r\n=Case 90.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nGottlieb S. left the barracks, January 25, 1915, met friends and drank\r\nwith them, remaining all night in the railway restaurant and waiting\r\nroom. He was promptly arrested.\r\n\r\nAccording to the patient, he had always drunk a good deal and had once\r\nfallen from his horse in the campaign, and become unconscious. After\r\nthis fall, he said he had been able to stand less alcohol than before.\r\n\r\nThere is doubt as to the syphilis of Gottlieb. He said he had been\r\ninfected once, but his further statement that he had six relapses is,\r\nof course, questionable. As to the hypothesis of feeblemindedness,\r\nit appears that in childhood he had learned badly and had been a\r\nstammerer. He had been a herdsman, and after that a laborer. He finally\r\nbecame a travelling man for a specialty photographer.\r\n\r\nHe had previously been convicted of an embezzlement, brawling, and\r\nbreach of the peace.\r\n\r\nAs to his military crime, he said he had been celebrating the emperor’s\r\nbirthday the last three days, being urged on by acquaintances and\r\ndrinking whiskey. He was, in fact, on a spree and did not eat properly.\r\nHe had met a student in the railway station and had forgotten all about\r\nhis military service. He remembered having spoken with the waiter,\r\nremembered telling the student that he was going to commit suicide, and\r\nthe student had drunk seltzer with him. January 29, he for some reason\r\ndrank no more, and then it occurred to him that he ought to go back to\r\nduty. He remembered that he was easily led astray. He had once thought\r\nof becoming a tanner but had been dissuaded from the trade because of\r\nits bad smell.\r\n\r\n    The analysis of this case must consider, first, syphilis.\r\n    Supposing, however, that this hypothesis is not substantiated\r\n    by laboratory findings, the hypothesis of feeblemindedness\r\n    might well be raised. It seems possible, if not probable,\r\n    that this patient was in the subnormal group, lying between\r\n    normality and feeble-mindedness proper. The value of mental\r\n    tests would here be extreme. There seems to be no evident\r\n    epilepsy, and the majority of the phenomena can perhaps best be\r\n    explained by alcoholism. Possibly the case is one of so-called\r\n    pathological intoxication. The patient’s own story that,\r\n    although he had been always subject to drink, he had been less\r\n    tolerant of alcohol since a fall from his horse, seems to be\r\n    entirely consistent with the post-traumatic history of numerous\r\n    cases, so that it would hardly be wise to consider that alcohol\r\n    accounts for the whole story. We must raise then in succession\r\n    the hypothesis of syphilis, feeblemindedness, alcoholism, and\r\n    coarse brain disease, bearing in mind also early stammering.\r\n    As to the utilization of such a man, it would appear that a\r\n    supervision of him with absolute countermanding of alcohol in\r\n    view of the decrease in tolerance of alcohol since the fall\r\n    from his horse might perhaps preserve this man for some form of\r\n    military service.\r\n\r\n_Re_ German and French war alcoholism, Soukhanoff remarks that the\r\nconditions in these countries were in strong contrast to those in\r\nRussia. In Russia there was a great decrease in the number of cases of\r\nacute alcoholic psychosis; particularly at the time of mobilization,\r\nthere were few cases of alcoholic psychosis. He says that during the\r\nRusso-Japanese war, alcoholic psychoses constituted a third of all the\r\nmental cases observed. This figure corresponds with that quoted above\r\nfrom Lépine (see under Case 86). Soukhanoff, writing in 1915, had not\r\nobserved personally a single case of alcoholic psychosis. Incidentally,\r\nthe number of cases of psychosis in the Russian army had remained in\r\ngeneral small.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesertion by mild alcoholic dement.\r\n\r\n=Case 91.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nEmil S. made a number of statements when he came for examination.\r\nHe had once had a treatment by injections. Both his mother and his\r\ngrandmother had been insane. He said that his brother was an officer in\r\nthe navy, but this statement was found to be false.\r\n\r\nAccording to his story, he had lost touch with his troop at the end\r\nof September, 1914, and had lived in several lodgings in T---- up to\r\nOctober 19, when he was arrested. He said that he did not know that a\r\nman who had lost touch with his troop had to report.\r\n\r\nA week after his arrest, S. entered a shop and asked for coffee, saying\r\nthat he had a furlough of 24 hours and wanted cake for his comrades.\r\nHe said he was the owner of an estate and would send a roebuck for the\r\ncakes. The shop-man gave him cakes to the value of one mark. Bystanders\r\nsaid that he had been lodging in T---- for about two weeks. It seems\r\nthat he had told his landlady that a city official had quartered him\r\nupon her and that he was on furlough. He went away in the morning and\r\ncame back in the evening. He had written to a bank of which he had\r\nonce been a representative, asking for money. One night he had lodged\r\nwith another landlady, being given a meal, and he had there stated\r\nthat he was in the City of T---- on duty and that his horse was in the\r\nbarracks. He offered a thousand marks for his board and lodging.\r\n\r\nAt another lodging he had given himself out as a courier. In fact,\r\nthe letter to the above-mentioned bank had been signed “Otto S.,\r\nLand-owner, at present, courier.”\r\n\r\n    “If I do not revoke this in person or by writing on January\r\n    1, 1915, I beg you to pay to Mr. and Mrs. M. of T----, one\r\n    thousand marks and deduct it from my balance.\r\n\r\n    “This is to be considered as my last will. As witness: present:\r\n    Joseph B.”\r\n\r\nThe letter was addressed “To the direction of Commercial-Counsellor\r\nP----.” There was no stamp on the letter.\r\n\r\nA second letter reads:\r\n\r\n    “Honored Sir, Commercial Counsellor:\r\n\r\n    I beg you to send by return mail to the address given below\r\n    1000 marks, and deduct this amount from my account. I have been\r\n    in Russia. Well, things are moving now. Thank God, we have\r\n    reached the point we have. Write me please more in detail about\r\n    my property and estate and give me your very valuable advice.\r\n\r\n    With best regards to your esteemed wife, I remain\r\n\r\n           Sincerely and respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                   Otto S., at present courier,\r\n                          otherwise, land-owner.”\r\n\r\nAs for this Commercial-Counsellor P., P.’s son stated that his father\r\nhad been dead for three years and a half.\r\n\r\nS. gave himself out in T---- as a land-owner, falsifying his name,\r\nasking for beer to the amount of a mark a day, borrowing from his\r\nlandlady ten marks, paying nothing, but remaining on friendly terms\r\nwith the landlady and her women lodgers, making a contract with a\r\nsuperintendent ostensibly for his estate, and borrowing money from him.\r\n\r\nObserved in the clinic, he said he was a bank representative and had\r\nbeen very nervous since being divorced in 1911. The divorce was due to\r\nhis wife’s adultery. Sometimes he would not know really what he was\r\ndoing, once even tried to shoot himself, and again once threw a burning\r\nlamp into his wife’s face without knowing it.\r\n\r\nHe had gone to the City of T---- without furlough in October because\r\nothers used to, too. Only five days later had he noticed that his troop\r\nwas no longer there; and upon inquiring about the troop he could find\r\nnothing as to its whereabouts.\r\n\r\nHe had been a heavy drinker and was always somewhat intoxicated, which,\r\naccording to the patient, made him forget everything. He had drunk 20\r\nglasses of beer and liquor daily. He wrote to P. because he knew his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nAs for the frauds, he said he knew nothing about them. He did not know\r\neven the baker from whom he had gotten the cakes. In fact, he had been\r\ndrunk the whole day long.\r\n\r\nHe said that he had learned badly in school and had not passed any\r\nexaminations. In active service he had already been convicted of\r\ndrunkenness once. Referring to his treatment by injections, he said\r\nhe would rather be dead. He had only sought diversion in looking\r\nover estates. Both his ability to reckon and his memory had suffered\r\ngreatly. He and another patient eloped from the clinic one day but were\r\ncaptured a few hours later.\r\n\r\n    Remarks: Details are lacking as to the physical and laboratory\r\n    side of this case. On the whole, there appeared to be no\r\n    convincing features of paresis or cerebrospinal syphilis.\r\n    The phenomena are very possibly in part alcoholic. There\r\n    appeared to be no sensory disorders, and in particular no\r\n    hallucinations. The intellectual disorder is chiefly amnestic.\r\n    There is little or no evidence of emotional abnormality. The\r\n    curious conduct seems hardly to indicate a primary disorder of\r\n    will. The main feature psychologically appears to be amnesia\r\n    coupled with an inability to reckon. To be sure, the letters\r\n    are written externally in sufficiently good form; the amnesia\r\n    does not appear to extend to details. It is a question of\r\n    whether the disorientation which one suspects is not merely\r\n    amnestic. On the whole, however, it would appear that there\r\n    must have been at various times disorder of consciousness,\r\n    as indeed is indicated by the patient’s own account of his\r\n    ignorance of the cake-roebuck episode.\r\n\r\n    Dismissing the hypothesis of a syphilitic dementia, we might\r\n    cling to that of alcoholic dementia more or less punctuated\r\n    by acute alcoholism. Yet it is also possible that the patient\r\n    was actually somewhat feeble-minded; this would be consistent\r\n    with his own statement. The question might arise whether\r\n    this soldier could have been excluded by careful psychiatric\r\n    examination before entering service. It would seem that a\r\n    knowledge of the insanity of the mother and grandmother, and an\r\n    inspection of school records, if available,--to say nothing of\r\n    the episodes which may or may not have been accurately related,\r\n    between himself and his afterwards divorced wife--would have\r\n    sufficed to throw doubt upon the military effectiveness of\r\n    this man. We know also that he had already been convicted of\r\n    drunkenness on military service before the episodes mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesertion by alcoholic. Contributory factors.\r\n\r\n=Case 92.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nCarl B. was a soldier about whom the captain thought that his\r\nintellectual power had been weakened by drink. An inquiry after\r\narrest showed that he had been odd also at home. He had once been\r\nsued for perjury, but the suit had been stopped for lack of evidence.\r\nHe had been several times convicted of drunkenness. It appears that\r\non March 30, 1915, after mounting guard, he said nothing and went\r\nhome, remaining at home until the next day and then returned to\r\nthe guardhouse in the street-car. He declared, this time, that the\r\nnon-commissioned officer had given him permission to leave, although\r\nthis statement was not correct.\r\n\r\nAgain, on April 6, B. was about to leave the quarters, but the surgeon,\r\nfinding him drunk, kept him back. He did not go home that night, and\r\nthe next day when he was wanted at the hearing, he could be found only\r\nin the afternoon. He replied confusedly and somewhat irrelevantly to\r\nthe questions asked. On arrival at the clinic he was in tears and much\r\ndepressed. Given 50 grams of alcohol, he became somewhat livelier.\r\nUpon examination, his perceptions were found diminished; he felt, he\r\nstated, a cracking and crackling in his neck. In his cell he had felt\r\nas if sparrows were roosting in his face; he had heard voices and\r\nseen pictures, and had not known what he was doing. He asserted his\r\ninnocence, blaming his imprisonment for all his troubles. He had been\r\nin the habit of drinking three liqueurs and two glasses of beer a day.\r\nHe had been drawing a pension since a fall from a scaffold.\r\n\r\nA sister had suffered from continual headaches. The patient himself had\r\nthree sickly children and ten of his children were dead; there were\r\nalso two premature births.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of this case would clearly show the benefit of\r\nconsidering, first, the hypothesis of syphilis. Not only is the history\r\nof his children suggestive, but the impairment of mind noted by the\r\ncaptain as due to alcohol may very possibly be syphilitic in origin.\r\nExamples in division he could not solve, and it is a question whether\r\nhis leaving guardmount is not in part related to disorientation for\r\ntime. There appears to be no evidence of feeblemindedness and none of\r\nepilepsy (though a sister suffered from continual headaches). Alcohol\r\nmay account possibly for the entire picture and is particularly\r\nconsistent with the false voices and figures, the sparrows in the\r\nface, and the sensations in neck and the tickling in the ears. It is\r\npossible, also, that intolerance to alcohol had set in since the fall\r\nfrom the scaffolding for which a pension was being received. It does\r\nnot appear necessary to consider any further of the groups of mental\r\ndisease. Syphilis, alcohol, and a post-traumatic brain condition, all\r\nmay play a part. Alcohol is able probably by itself to produce a number\r\nof these symptoms, and these alcoholic symptoms would be probably the\r\nmore readily produced in virtue of the post-traumatic intolerance that\r\nwe may assume.\r\n\r\n\r\nA disciplinary case: Alcoholism.\r\n\r\n=Case 93.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA German soldier, brought up for examination for disobedience and\r\ninsubordination with intoxication, was found already to have been\r\nconvicted 33 times of a variety of crimes. Once he had drunk a bottle\r\nof shoemaker’s polish, evidently with suicidal intent.\r\n\r\nIn the canteen he had assaulted superior officers and tried to strike a\r\nsergeant. He said he had been attacked by the sergeant and pushed into\r\na cell, whereupon he had lost his mind.\r\n\r\nHe came from a family of drunkards, and had been himself very alcoholic\r\nformerly. On the day in question, however, he had drunk very little.\r\nAccording to his account, he had fits of this sort if any one injured\r\nhim. He was amnestic and had forgotten his previous convictions.\r\nAnything he might have done, he said, had happened a long time ago, in\r\nhis youth. For example, concerning a theft, he said that it was merely\r\nthat he had fallen into some Christmas trees and stuck fast there, and\r\nno one wanted to be paid. Tremors of hands, feet, head. Analgesia of\r\nthorax.\r\n\r\n_Re_ alcoholism and disciplinary cases, we find alcoholism bulking\r\nlarge in Lépine’s account of military delinquency. Fugue subjects are\r\nnot infrequently alcoholic. Minor disobedience is also often alcoholic.\r\nActs of violence are characteristically alcoholic, or executed by\r\nsubjects with hereditary alcoholic taint. (Such acts were in France\r\nespecially common before the anti-absinthe law in 1915.) Alcoholic\r\nepisodes and impulses often culminate in arson. No doubt, espionage\r\nemploys alcoholism for a portion of its technique, though delusional\r\nmystics and subnormal hypersuggestibles are more often the purveyors\r\nof information to the enemy. The theft list, also, shows its share of\r\nalcoholics. Alcoholics are less common amongst those who, contrary\r\nto rules, assume shoulder-straps or other decorations. Here the\r\nsub-normals and victims of imbalance, as well as the drug cases, are\r\nmore likely to figure if the matter is psychiatric at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarks upon an atrocity.\r\n\r\n=Case 94.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nApril 15, 1915, a German soldier went with three comrades to a farm, to\r\nselect a sheep for slaughter; they were obliged to go to three farms.\r\nThe man carried a revolver and cartridges in his pocket. He threatened\r\nthe farmer that he met with this revolver, and desired to rape the\r\nfarmer’s daughter. He was very drunk, and said to the non-commissioned\r\nofficer who was called in at the time, “You have served only a year\r\nlonger than I have.” He staggered, struck violently with his hand at\r\nthe sergeant, and gave insolent replies.\r\n\r\nHe had already choked the peasant’s daughter, scratched her face, and\r\nbitten her fingers, hand and arm. She could not run away as she was\r\nlame. The soldier held the revolver to her face and shot it off several\r\ntimes, offered sex assault, scratched her feet with his spurs, and\r\ntried to twist her neck. The non-commissioned officer threatened to\r\nshoot him, and he then became still. He said to the first-lieutenant\r\nbefore whom he was taken, that he would do anything but allow himself\r\nto be beaten, and at this moment moved his arms about in the air, and\r\nbloody foam came from his mouth. The first-lieutenant previously had\r\nalways thought him to be normal except for a strange flicker and unrest\r\nof the eyes. There was a history that he had already once attacked a\r\nservant girl. The man had amnesia for the affair, only remembering how\r\nthe non-commissioned officer had come on a white horse. He remembered\r\nnothing about the peasant and the girl. He said that he had been given\r\nto earache on the right side in winter. There was a history of his\r\nhaving fallen from a tree in childhood, becoming unconscious. He had\r\nbeen a sufficiently good scholar up to the second class in school. He\r\nhad been an excellent soldier.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlcoholism: Atrocity.\r\n\r\n=Case 95.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nSeptember 15, 1914, a German soldier was missed. He had said that\r\nhe wanted to get to the enemy quickly, and that he was going to\r\nmarch alone against the Russians. A shot was fired that night by\r\nthis soldier, on the ground that he had been insulted by a civilian,\r\nalthough no civilian was present.\r\n\r\nSeptember 21, a farmer in a wagon reached a farm, where he found the\r\nsoldier aiming at a woman. He fired, wounded the woman severely, and\r\njumped on the farmer’s wagon and rode off with him. It seems that\r\nthe soldier had come to the farm at noontime and accused the woman\r\nof treachery, ordering her to come with her husband to a certain\r\nfarmhouse, where she should be placed against the wall and be shot. The\r\nsoldier had shot her and wounded her husband also. According to the\r\nwoman, the idea was to take revenge because she had denounced certain\r\npersons as spies.\r\n\r\nHe was arrested during the night, and told how he had left his troop\r\nbecause he could not get at the enemy. He had been informed that there\r\nwere spies who ought to be shot; there had been talk in a certain inn\r\nabout it. He did not know he had wounded the husband, and he only\r\nwanted to give that dangerous woman a piece of his mind.\r\n\r\nAfter wounding the woman, he had given himself no further thought about\r\nher, but had gone to partake of the holy sacrament at the pastor’s. He\r\nthen had drunk another glass of beer and gone to bed. He was, in fact,\r\nstill drunk at the time of arrest. He had not been aware that he would\r\nbe punished for the crime of going alone against the Russians.\r\n\r\nSome days later, he wrote that he did not intend to kill the woman,\r\nthat he had been drunk at the time and was always a bad man when drunk;\r\nthat he had other times when he absented himself from home for days\r\nwhen drunk. He had had, he said, a number of attacks of delirium, in\r\nwhich he had seen animals. At one time, he had fallen on his head.\r\nOn the day in question, he had drunk 1½ litres of liquor. He was\r\nremorseful for his deed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA disciplinary case: Alcoholism; amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 96.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA German soldier, New Year’s Eve, 1915, got away from his company,\r\ndrank whiskey, and came back drunk. He bothered his comrades so that\r\nthe non-commissioned officer had to call for help; whereupon the\r\nsoldier said, “A man who comes on late and hasn’t been in much, hasn’t\r\nmuch to say. If it is a non-commissioned officer, I shall hit him\r\nin the snout.” The officer kept talking to him kindly but he cried\r\n“_Halt’s Maul_, you crooked …!” He staggered up to the lieutenant\r\nwithout saluting, but at a slight push fell prone into the straw.\r\n\r\nIt transpired that the man had not been intoxicated enough to lose all\r\ncontrol of himself. He did not remember anything about what he had\r\ndone; he had drunk a half-bottle of rum during the evening. There was a\r\ndemonstrable lack of memory. He did not know the German provinces, and\r\nthought that Bismarck had once been war minister. There was a tremor,\r\nhypalgesia of the left leg and analgesia of the left arm and left\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nIt was found that he came from a strongly tainted family, with\r\ntwo insane sisters and three insane cousins. He had been a good\r\nsoldier during his service, but had accused his father of alcoholism\r\nbaselessly. He had always been difficult to manage when drunk and had\r\nbeen convicted nine times: five for dangerous assault and battery. He\r\ndrank up to 1⅓ litres of whiskey a day if he got time, and also took\r\nether. For some ten years he had been amnestic for what he did while\r\ndrunk; nor, according to his wife, had he been able recently to stand\r\nso much alcohol. He said that he had had a fall from a wagon in 1911 or\r\n’12, after which he had been unconscious.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntebellum, run over by an automobile; intolerance of alcohol; episodes\r\nof amnesia after moderate alcohol.\r\n\r\n=Case 97.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA German soldier was advanced in rank February 26, 1915, and in honor\r\nthereof drank six or seven glasses of beer. On his way home, he met a\r\ncaptain and failed to salute him. When called to account, he said he\r\ncould not see, and made remarks about regrettable behavior. He refused\r\nto go along with the officer. Afterwards he remembered that he had been\r\nstopped by an officer but had forgotten subsequent happenings.\r\n\r\nMarch 24, he was riding in an electric car with a lieutenant. He said\r\nto the lieutenant who had unbuckled his sabre, “It is a piece of\r\ninsolence and improper to unbuckle the sabre.” He repeated the phrase\r\non questioning. He was then asked to give his name, and replied, “I\r\nknow my name but what is your name, Mr. Lieutenant?” He looked drunk at\r\nthe time but afterwards remembered nothing.\r\n\r\nPhysically he was tremulous and showed blepharospasm. His face grew red\r\non bending over.\r\n\r\nThis man had been run over by an automobile in 1910, after which he had\r\nbecome excitable, slow-thinking and forgetful. The spinous processes\r\nwere painful on pressure, as was also the hip joint. The history\r\nshowed that he had been convicted six times of various crimes, such as\r\ndisturbing the peace, embezzlement, and the like. Since this accident\r\nhe had not been able to work effectively. He had gone into the army in\r\na spirit of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdventure with a stranger in Paris.\r\n\r\n=Case 98.= (BRIAND and HAURY, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier had seven days’ leave in Paris, beginning December 27, 1915,\r\nand the first day drank a good deal of wine with another man on leave.\r\nThey met, in some place that the patient had forgotten, a well-dressed\r\nman whom they did not know, and all three fell to drinking. The\r\nstranger told them he knew a trick to prolong the leave to 3 or 4\r\nweeks. “All I have got to do is to prick you, and it will cost only 100\r\nsous.” The operation was done at the café after payment in advance.\r\nThe operation was a puncture with a needle between the middle and ring\r\nfingers of the left hand. Next day there was a phlegmon of the dorsal\r\nsurface of the hand, and he was put into hospital saying that he had\r\ngotten a barbed wire prick in the trenches. The surgeon who opened the\r\nphlegmon was surprised at its gummy appearance, gangrenous odor, and\r\ngreenish tint. In point of fact, petrol had been injected.\r\n\r\n\r\nMorphinism: Tetanus.\r\n\r\n=Case 99.= (BRIAND, 1914.)\r\n\r\nMdm. L. was a morphinist. After the outbreak of the war, she went to a\r\ngeneral hospital to recover from morphinism, but was too excited to be\r\nkept there. Accordingly, she had to be sent to Sainte-Anne, but upon\r\narrival she developed distinct signs of tetanus.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Mdm. L. was the widow of a Colonial who had given her the\r\nfirst injections ten years before, for dysentery. She tried several\r\ntimes to stop. Daily dose 1.5 grams.\r\n\r\nShe was in a cachectic state, and according to her mother, took no care\r\nof her syringe, trailing it about everywhere. Her thighs, arms, and\r\nanterior aspect of the body were covered with scars. There were small\r\nphlegmons in places. Did she inoculate herself with bacillus tetani\r\nfrom an infected needle? In any case, she died of tetanus.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicolegal question concerning a morphinist.\r\n\r\n=Case 100.= (BRIAND, 1914.)\r\n\r\nA man worked in Paris on the ’Change, where there are a number of\r\nsyringe victims. He had been brought up in Paris but was not a\r\nFrenchman. Enthused by his friends and the prey of deep emotion, he\r\nenlisted. He was of an introspective nature and himself wondered\r\nwhether the morphine did not have something to do with his enlisting.\r\nHe said, “I had been unnerved for a number of days by reading the\r\npapers, and after a number of heavy injections, I went to a recruiting\r\nstation and signed on.” In his regiment, he continued the injections,\r\nbut shortly found that he would be unable to replenish his diminishing\r\nstock of drug. He explained his unhappy fate to the corps physician,\r\nand was sent to Val-de-Grâce. He asked to be retired, alleging that\r\nhe was under the influence of a poison when he went to the recruiting\r\noffice and had therefore committed an illegal act.\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial effects of the war on two drug addicts.\r\n\r\n=Cases 101 and 102.= (BRIAND, 1914.)\r\n\r\nFernand and Emilienne were two recidivists in morphinism. Although\r\nneither was over 22 years of age, both had been several times convicted\r\nof shop-lifting. They stole only if they had no money for morphine.\r\nProstitution served to care for Emilienne, while Fernand was at times a\r\ncocaine seller, and at times made money in devious ways at Montmartre.\r\nEmilienne’s patronage scattered with the war, and it was the same with\r\nFernand’s. Accordingly, there was no money for either morphine or\r\ncocaine. Moreover, the shops being not crowded were easier to watch. As\r\nEmilienne did not care to be arrested and sent off as an undesirable,\r\nshe presented herself at the hospital for the insane at Sainte-Anne.\r\nFernand shortly joined her there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. ENCEPHALOPSYCHOSES\r\n\r\n(THE FOCAL BRAIN DISEASE GROUP.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLeft-sided hemiplegia and aphasia: Contrecoup and local lesions.\r\n\r\n=Case 103.= (LHERMITTE, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier of 23 was wounded in the left parietal region and showed a\r\n_left_-sided hemiplegia with aphasia. The speech difficulty, although\r\nvery marked, retrograded almost completely, but the hemiplegia remained\r\nsevere. This hemiplegia was a spastic one, of a classical nature, with\r\nBabinski sign and exaggeration of tendon reflexes. Lhermitte thinks\r\nthat the left hemisphere was directly affected by the contusion, as\r\nin point of fact there was an actual loss of bony tissue, but that it\r\nwould not be necessary to suppose the ipsilateral hemiplegia was due to\r\nan absence of pyramidal decussation. The transient aphasia was probably\r\ndue to direct affection of the tissues on the left side of the brain;\r\nthe permanent hemiplegia was doubtless due to a lesion of the opposite\r\nhemisphere produced by contrecoup. It appears that sometimes a surgeon\r\nmay be led to superfluous surgical intervention in a case of such\r\nparadoxical hemiplegia, since the surgeon may believe that a bullet\r\nor shell fragment has traversed the brain substance to the opposite\r\nside of the skull, when as a matter of fact the brain parts have been\r\ninjured merely by contrecoup.\r\n\r\n_Re_ such amnesia, it is of note that many head cases, even if they do\r\nnot show amnesia, show a conspicuous euphoria and lack of understanding\r\nof the seriousness of the injury in question and of the necessary\r\ntreatment. According to E. Meyer, there are constantly to be found\r\nin head cases disturbances of perception and lack of coördination\r\n(especially for time), perseveration, difficulty in thinking and\r\ncalculating.\r\n\r\n                                CHART 5\r\n\r\n                           COMMOTIO CEREBRI\r\n\r\n      I. SENSES: Asymmetrical hyp- or anesthesia (with hyperalgesia\r\n         and osseous hyperesthesia).\r\n\r\n     II. MOTILITY: Disorder, muscular or reflex. General or\r\n         unilateral hyperexcitability.\r\n\r\n    III. VASOMOTOR CONTROL: Dermatographia. Cardiac, splanchnic\r\n         disorder; also, Headaches, Vertigo.\r\n\r\n     IV. EMOTIONS: Disorder.\r\n\r\n      V. INTAKE OF IDEAS: Disorder. Persistent lacunae of memory.\r\n\r\n     VI. INTELLIGENCE: Disorder of recollective memory.\r\n         Speech-disorder. Intellectual inertia. Overimagination\r\n         (hallucinations, tremors).\r\n\r\n                                           Mairet, Piéron, Bouzansky.\r\n\r\n\r\nGunshot wound of head; alcoholism: Amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 104.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA German soldier had a bullet pass through his right eye and lower\r\njaw, leaving a fistulous opening from the mouth. He said that he was\r\ncompletely blind, but ophthalmological examination cast doubt upon the\r\nblindness. There had been immediately after the injury a number of\r\nsevere attacks of dizziness, which lasted several hours; and another\r\nattack developed after he had come back from hospital, to which he had\r\ngone by reason of his pains.\r\n\r\nHe was to be arrested on account of a disciplinary crime and had\r\nostensibly gone to his mother’s house, there to await arrest. The\r\nnon-commissioned officer found him in a saloon. As soon as the phrase,\r\n“You are my prisoner!” was said, the soldier lost track of his\r\nsurroundings. He had drunk a few glasses of beer but did not himself\r\nthink he was drunk at the time. He was insulting and violent when asked\r\nto proceed with the officer, and a policeman was called in to take\r\ncharge. He then lay down in the street and had to be put upon a wagon,\r\nstill firing abusive phrases at his captors.\r\n\r\nUpon examination, aside from the effects of the gunshot, excessive\r\nknee-jerks and tremors of the body were found. The eyebrows met but\r\nthere was no other sign of bodily stigmata. There seems to have been no\r\nhereditary disease, or any history of severe alcoholism, though the man\r\nhad been convicted previously of violence and theft. The amnesia is to\r\nbe ascribed to effects of the head injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet in brain: Crises; cortical blindness; vertigo; hallucinations.\r\n\r\n=Case 105.= (LEREBOULLET AND MOUZON, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn invalided soldier, 40, was sent to be observed, Oct. 23, 1916,\r\nbecause he wanted his pension renewed. He had been retired a year\r\nbefore for diminution of binocular vision with impaired perspective\r\nof objects in the right half of the visual field. He had now become\r\ncompletely blind.\r\n\r\nHe had been wounded, March 12, 1915, in the Argonne, without losing\r\nconsciousness. He was wounded at ten o’clock at night and waited until\r\nthe next day to walk to the ambulance and was at this time able to see\r\nperfectly. Arriving at the ambulance he lost consciousness. He was\r\ntrephined but remembers nothing about the trephining.\r\n\r\nHis memory grew better from his arrival at a hospital in the rear in\r\nApril. An attempt was made to remove the bullet in May, 1915. Though\r\nthe surgeon’s finger was pushed as far as the tentorium the patient\r\ndid not lose consciousness or sight, but on leaving the operating\r\nroom he fainted and, after a few days of restlessness and delirium,\r\nhe became completely blind. There was a cerebral hernia difficult to\r\nreduce. Vision became a little better and light and persons could\r\nbe distinguished at the time when he was retired. A month after the\r\noperation there was a convulsive crisis beginning in the left arm,\r\naffecting the legs and ending in unconsciousness. Several similar\r\ncrises occurred in August, sometimes with and sometimes without loss\r\nof consciousness. Later these crises began to be limited to the left\r\nside and then to be ushered in by visual hallucinations. At home he\r\nwas unable to care for, clothe or feed himself. The crises became more\r\nfrequent. The visual hallucinations began to dominate.\r\n\r\nThis situation lasted to February, 1916, when the blindness which had\r\nbeen increasing since the onset of the hallucinations became complete.\r\nThe crises now became less frequent and intense. Headaches not severe\r\nwere exaggerated after seizures. The patient acted like a totally\r\nblind person and said that he had before him a uniform and constant\r\ngray without any light or dark spots or any color. Upon this background\r\nbizarre pictures, caricatures, disguised persons, animals or nameless\r\nthings appeared colorless without relief, in silhouette, but highly\r\nsuggestive of reality to such a degree that at first, according to the\r\npatient, he had made gestures to reach, or push aside these pictures.\r\nThe crises were Jacksonian.\r\n\r\nPallor, perspiration, shivering, irresponsiveness, clonic spasms of\r\nleft arm followed. The patient always had a premonition permitting him\r\nto get into bed if he was sitting, for example, in his chair. Sometimes\r\nthere was a dizzy sensation as if the body were being rotated to the\r\nleft. This sensation did not occur at the beginning of the seizure and\r\nthe patient fought against it, turning to the right. Sometimes he felt\r\nas if he were sliding at great speed down an inclined plane. Headaches\r\nand sleepiness followed, but there was never any complete loss of\r\nconsciousness of memory.\r\n\r\nThe eye grounds proved normal and all the photomotor reflexes were\r\nnormal, though there was no pupil reflex to pain. The patient could\r\nwrite readily to dictation printed letters. It would seem that these\r\nprinted letters mean that he had visual memories, as he traced the\r\ncharacters as if from a design. Speech was monotonous with some\r\nstuttering; but his speech had always been of this sort according to\r\ninformation. He walked with difficulty, not merely on account of his\r\nvisual but on account of his equilibration disorders. Outside of his\r\nseizures he always turned to the right and if left to himself standing\r\nhe turned to the right. If asked to walk straight ahead, he always\r\nturned to the right. Silent and uncommunicative, he was amiable and\r\nsometimes even gay. He often had troublous dreams, sometimes seeing\r\nhis relatives. He said he could bring up in his mind the faces of his\r\nrelatives and even the appearance of the Salpêtrière. Reflexes and\r\nsensations were normal. There was a traumatic rupture of the tympanum.\r\nLumbar puncture showed a slight excess of albumin and 1.8 lymphocytes\r\nto the cubic millimeter. The Mauser bullet was found by X-ray in the\r\nleft calcarine region with its base touching the median line, and\r\napplied to the inner table of the skull about a centimeter above the\r\ninternal occipital protuberance pointing forward, outward, and upward.\r\nHe was treated on a salt free diet with bromides. The seizures grew\r\nfewer and at the time of report two months had elapsed with nothing\r\nbut a slight vertigo and frequent nightmares. Intellectually also the\r\npatient had improved.\r\n\r\nThe case is one of cortical blindness. The seizures are explained by\r\nthe vicinity of the right Rolandic region to the lesion. The rotatory\r\nvertigo is to be explained by the contact of the Mauser bullet with\r\nthe tentorium and vermis of the cerebellum, which may also explain\r\nthe difficulties in orientation that occurred between the crises. The\r\nvisual hallucinations are doubtless due to lesion of the calcarine\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTunisian theopath with mystical hallucinations; gun-shot wound\r\nof occiput (bullet extracted): After the trauma, Lilliputian\r\nhallucinations and micro-megalopsia.\r\n\r\n=Case 106.= (LAIGNEL-LAVASTINE AND COURBON, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA. ben S. was sent to Villejuif with the diagnosis: “depression,\r\nfeeling of impotence, discouragement,” having been found on the public\r\nstreet. He was indifferent, almost completely mute, and was at first\r\nconsidered not to understand French. In a fortnight, however, he was\r\ntalking freely and was then found to be afflicted with hallucinations,\r\nmelancholia, and delusions, apparently following trauma to the skull.\r\n\r\nA. ben S. might have been about thirty years old, and was of a rich\r\nfamily, indigenous in Tunis, well educated in the Koran and Arabic\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nUpon examination, this Tunisian gunner showed contraction of visual\r\nfields, poor color vision, and general hypalgesia. During examination,\r\nthe man seized the needle and plunged it deeply under his skin,\r\nexclaiming that a prophet felt nothing and that he could be cut into\r\nbits without feeling pain.\r\n\r\nIt seems that he had had divine visions from early childhood. In his\r\nyouth he had once gone to a mountain near his home and talked with\r\nMohammed and Allah. Of course, Allah did not appear in human form, but\r\nhe appeared like a ball or a wheel of fire, slowly turning. Mohammed\r\nwas a tall man, with a long white beard, his eyes darting rays of\r\nfire, and his forehead bearing a gleaming bright body. Allah was heard\r\ntalking to Mohammed. Orders were given concerning the sun and stars.\r\nSubterranean treasures were displayed, as well as Paradise full of\r\nyellow, blue, and green houris, transparent, such that, when food was\r\ntaken, it could be seen going down their throats. Hell too was visible,\r\nand the devil very tall and black, an eye behind and another on top.\r\nThere were also many genii--little men who climbed over the Tunisian’s\r\nbody. Sometimes in dreams, Allah carried him to all countries of the\r\nearth. It was hard to tell whether these effects were hallucinations\r\nor vivid imaginings. The Tunisian had been wounded after several months\r\nof service by two bullets in one day: the one causing an insignificant\r\nlip-wound; the other entering the skull behind. After several months\r\nthe bullet had been extracted by trephining.\r\n\r\nHis further history was obscured by the fact that he wove delusional\r\nelements into his story. He said, for example, that he had been\r\ncourt-martialed, though there was no evidence that this was a fact. It\r\nis probable that after his wound the patient in a delirium felt that he\r\nwas going to be shot. The visual hallucinations were very interesting,\r\nbeing Lilliputian. He would see three or four hundred Tunisian gunners\r\nwalking along, knee-high or taller. Sometimes they all would stop and\r\naim at him. He also showed micromegalopsia, real objects changing their\r\nheight under his eyes. Both the Lilliputian hallucinations and the\r\nmicromegalopsia dated from the trauma to the skull. There was no change\r\nwhatever in the mystical delusions concerning Allah and Mohammed. These\r\nhe had before the trauma.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeningococcus meningitis with apparent recovery: Dementing psychosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 107.= (MAIXANDEAU, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in the Heavy Artillery, 42, developed occipital headaches and\r\nKernig’s sign, December 27, 1915.\r\n\r\nDecember 31, at the Hôtel-Dieu, he showed myosis, slight photophobia,\r\nmeningitic tâche, temperature 39.6, pulse 84, heart sounds dull. Lumbar\r\npuncture: hemorrhagic fluid.\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, the headache was intense, neck stiffness increased, Kernig’s\r\nsign less marked; morning and afternoon temperature 39.2. Lumbar\r\npuncture yielded hypertensive cloudy fluid and 30 cubic centimeters of\r\nserum were administered.\r\n\r\nThis dose was repeated January 2 and January 3, on which date there was\r\nno headache.\r\n\r\nJanuary 4, Kernig’s sign and neck stiffness were diminished; fine râles\r\nat the bases without dulness. 30 cubic centimeters of electragol were\r\ninjected intravenously.\r\n\r\nJanuary 5, Kernig and neck stiffness slight. Meningitic tâche;\r\nexaggerated knee-jerks; unequal pupils; temp. 36.6 morning, 39.4\r\nafternoon; respiration 36; pulse 120; no râles; splenic enlargement.\r\n\r\n6, no headache or photophobia; constipation; fine râles, right base;\r\nspartein; meningococci found in hypertensive spinal fluid. 30 cc. serum.\r\n\r\n7, more râles; exaggerated heart sounds; intestinal worms in stools.\r\n\r\n8, temperature fell to 37; pulse to 90.\r\n\r\n9, patient worse; involuntary stools; Kernig’s sign; stiff neck; fever.\r\n30 cc. serum injected.\r\n\r\n10, 20 cc. injected.\r\n\r\n11, delirious all night; tetaniform stiffness of neck; more râles.\r\n\r\n12, delirious, incoherent words, Cheyne-Stokes breathing.\r\n\r\n13, less stiffness, Kernig almost absent; pupils normal; Romberg sign\r\nslightly developed; pulse 120.\r\n\r\n14, a few râles at right base.\r\n\r\n15, pains in elbows, knees and hands with joint swelling; moist râles;\r\ntemp. 38.4; pulse 140. Digitalon.\r\n\r\n16 and 17, serum erythema of thorax; edema of left knee; pulse 150;\r\nspartein 16.\r\n\r\n17, ice pack over heart.\r\n\r\n18, edema of knee diminished; no headache, delirium or pupillary sign.\r\n\r\n19, improvement. Temperature normal thereafter.\r\n\r\n20 and 21, fine râles. Then all symptoms disappeared.\r\n\r\nRecovery was predicted, but on January 28 it was observed that the\r\npatient was untidy, made mistakes in dressing, such as trying to put\r\nhis legs into the armholes of his shirt, and denied the most evident\r\nfacts: His _képi_ on his head, he said it was not. Face drawn; skin\r\nyellow. Appearance of asthenia. Deep depression and hebetude. At this\r\ntime the knee-jerks were exaggerated, pupils unequal, vermicular tremor\r\nof tongue; the patient walked on a broad base with tremulous legs\r\nsuggesting contracture and weakness.\r\n\r\nFebruary 8, in a similar state the patient wandered about his room,\r\nmoving his bed and chairs about, answering questions with an absent\r\nair. He had now been taught to be less untidy.\r\n\r\nMarch 5, stiff neck and Kernig’s sign were distinct. He made believe he\r\nwas on his farm. Ecchymosis of right upper eyelid: he had fallen (his\r\nsheep had pushed him over!). The improbability of this idea did not\r\npersuade him to think it had not happened. He walked after the manner\r\nof a tabetic.\r\n\r\nIn April he became bedridden, unable to walk, with marked stiffness and\r\nKernig’s sign. He had at this time periods of excitement in which he\r\nwould tear the bedclothes. He was invalided as demented.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeningococcus meningitis.\r\n\r\n=Case 108.= (ESCHBACH AND LACAZE, November, 1915.)\r\n\r\nDuring his eleven months captivity at Grafenwöhr, Eschbach and Lacaze\r\nhad the opportunity of observing the case of a soldier, 24, who\r\nsustained a shell-wound in the left lung and was made prisoner August\r\n20, 1914, at Chateau Salins. He got well of his wound, but February\r\n16, 1915, began to cry out and was restless in the night. He was found\r\non the straw muttering words among which only the word, “Head, head,”\r\ncould be distinguished. He was irresponsive, possibly deaf. Suddenly he\r\nhad a convulsive crisis and whenever touched he would have jactitations\r\nand cry out. Otherwise, he was calm and stuporous. The pupils were\r\nwidely dilated. In short, he showed a mental confusion associated with\r\nparoxysmal excitement due to cerebral and cutaneous hyperesthesia. The\r\nfirst symptoms had occurred the morning before, when he leaned his head\r\nagainst a wall and complained.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture yielded intra- and extracellular meningococci. The\r\npatient was isolated. In the afternoon he became less agitated,\r\nkept his eyes closed, mumbled, repeated gestures, would spit in his\r\nhands, rub his hands together, rub his neck, shoulders and body, or\r\nelse he would pass his hands over his forehead and through his hair.\r\nOccasionally he would seize the straw and draw it to him with all his\r\nstrength. Once when asked, “What is your name?” he said, “Not true. Not\r\ntrue.” Hallucinations appeared to have been added to the situation. The\r\nneck was a little stiff to forced flexion. Temperature 37.8. Lumbar\r\npuncture under chloroform anesthesia; antimeningococcus serum was\r\ninjected. Next day quieter; able to get up and walk. Slept, mumbled\r\nless, was able to answer simple questions, desired to urinate and\r\nfinally succeeded.\r\n\r\nFebruary 19, no mental disorder. Headache and lassitude. Neck stiff,\r\nKernig’s sign marked. Lumbar puncture yielded a fluid now puriform;\r\nantimeningococcus serum injected. February 20, lifting the head\r\nproduced opisthotonos. Labial herpes. The fluid yielded, besides\r\nmeningococci, also endothelial cells. Serum injected. February 21,\r\nfibrin in fluid; serum injected. February 22, no head symptoms. Herpes\r\nmore intense, involving also arms. Tongue coated. Temperature 37.5,\r\nevening 38.3. February 23, meningococci and lymphocytes in fluid.\r\nFebruary 24, left knee swollen. Serum injected; puncture fluid showed\r\nmeningococci and polynucleosis. Fluid from knee showed polynuclear\r\ncells without organisms. February 25, patient reached evening\r\ntemperature of 39.5; serum injected. A few meningococci, altered\r\npolynuclear leucocytes. February 26, patient rigid, tongue coated,\r\nserum injection. Rare meningococci, degenerated polynuclear leucocytes.\r\nFebruary 27, rigidity decreased, evening temperature 37.7. February\r\n28, Kernig’s sign absent. Herpes dry. Serum injection. Fluid clear;\r\nlymphocytes and polynuclear cells; no meningococci. March 6, painful\r\ninguinal gland on the left side. March 7, epididymitis left (mumps two\r\nyears before, with headache two weeks and double orchitis). March 9,\r\nserum eruption. March 17, epididymitis practically absent. Lymph node\r\npainful. Later data impossible to get, except that there was apparently\r\nan arthritis of the hip and a sacral decubitus with eventual recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion: Meningitic syndrome, fourteen months.\r\n\r\n=Case 109.= (PITRES AND MARCHAND, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier sustained shell-shock at the distance of a meter at\r\nSaint-Hilaire, September 26, 1915. He lost consciousness and blood\r\nflowed from his ears. He arrived, September 28, at the neurological\r\ncenter in Bordeaux in a semistupor, knowing that he had been shocked\r\nand had lost consciousness. He groaned, cried out, and kept stroking\r\nhis head with his right hand; lay on the right side; showed Kernig’s\r\nsign right, ptosis, and stiff neck. Headache was increased on moving\r\nand noises. Patient constantly asked for food, but refused to drink.\r\nLumbar puncture yielded a yellowish fluid, due to laked blood. October\r\n3, headache, ptosis, left internal strabismus, temperature 38.5.\r\nOctober 4, lumbar puncture, slightly blood-tinted fluid. October 5,\r\nimprovement; gap in memory for period since shock. No strabismus,\r\nptosis diminished, temperature normal, improvement continued. Kernig’s\r\nsign and headache persisted. He lay doubled up on the right side, eyes\r\nclosed, right hand on pillow. Defense movements on touching the neck\r\nor occipital region. The condition of semistupor often passed off in\r\nthe afternoon, when he could talk, write or play cards. He had always\r\nsmoked, even at the beginning of his disease. Lumbar puncture yielded\r\na normal fluid December 12, 1915. He was sent February 23, 1916, to a\r\nhospital in the country, but came back May 9.\r\n\r\nIt seems that several days after transfer he had had an attack of\r\ndelirium in the night, having lost consciousness, and tried continually\r\nto get up out of bed, saying that he wanted to go to Verdun to fight.\r\nThis spell lasted several hours and on the days following came mutism,\r\nrefusal of food, and a state of stupor. Nutritive enemata were given.\r\nAs he grew better he sometimes ate a great deal, sometimes nothing,\r\neven wanted poison from his family, and wrote to a comrade that he\r\nwanted to commit suicide.\r\n\r\nMay 9, he was clearer, told of seeing the shell, which he said he had\r\nnot heard, nor did he know how he had gotten to a hospital. His head\r\nand spine had hurt him ever since the shock. He had had difficulty\r\nin urination for two days after the shock. He could not remember\r\nthe delirious attack in the country hospital. He gave various data\r\nabout his life, but not fully. He refused to lie on the left side,\r\nor to walk, because of pain. He could lift either leg from the\r\nbed, but hardly both. There was an irregular coarse tremor of the\r\nextremities. The right hand was weaker than the left; there were no\r\nreflex disorders; no change in the eye grounds. There was a patchy\r\nanalgesia. May 26, stupor reappeared as before, with semimutism. June,\r\nthe patient presented the appearance of a dementia praecox in stupor,\r\nwith stereotyped gestures and attitudes, without catatonia. The patient\r\nwas sent to a hospital for the insane at Cadillac. November 9, 1916, he\r\nreturned to the neurological center, as mental and cerebral disorder\r\nhad disappeared. There still persisted a difficulty in remembering\r\nfacts since the shock and there was still a functional paresis of the\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nWe here deal with a case of a meningitic syndrome following shell-shock\r\nand lasting fourteen months.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrain abscess in a syphilitic: Matutinal loss of knee-jerks.\r\n\r\n=Case 110.= (DUMOLARD, REBIERRE, QUELLIEN, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn unmarried subaltern officer, 30, entered an army neuropsychiatric\r\ncenter, April 8, 1915, looking exhausted and bearing a ticket “nervous\r\nasthenia, evacuated for neurological examination.” He said he had had\r\nscarlet fever at ten; strongly denied syphilis, of which he presented\r\nno trace; had not been excessively alcoholic and had had no nervous\r\nseizures. Detailed information showed that he had been a normal child.\r\nHe left his two years’ military service with promotion and was a man of\r\nabove the ordinary intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe was wounded in the right buttock with a shrapnel bullet about the\r\nend of September, 1914. He went back to his regiment two months later\r\nand had shared in a number of actions up to the time of his evacuation.\r\nHe said he had been very tired for several weeks, and had finally been\r\nsent to the physician. There were pains in the kidney region and in\r\nthe head, especially on the right side. The head felt empty. He could\r\nnot sleep, but did not dream. Ideas were not distinct. Memory had\r\nbecome impaired. He could not keep his accounts right, and was afraid\r\nsomething might go wrong.\r\n\r\nThere was no pain or nervous or reflex disorder of any sort except for\r\nthe knee-jerks and Achilles jerks (see below). A special examination\r\nproved complete normality of eyes. There was a slight hesitation in\r\nwords, but no dysarthria. There was a slight tremor of the tongue and\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nAs to the tendon reflexes, April 9, on waking, the knee-jerks were\r\nabsent, but later in the day gradually came in evidence again. The\r\nAchilles jerks were also absent at first, but could be obtained after\r\na prolonged examination and after percussion of the calf. In the\r\nafternoon, after exercise, the knee-jerks and Achilles jerks were\r\neasily demonstrable. The left Achilles jerk was always a little weaker\r\nthan the right. Massage brought these jerks out to virtual normality.\r\nApril 10 and thereafter, similar findings; percussion of the muscular\r\nmasses of the thighs and calves always brought out the reflexes.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture yielded a clear fluid with hyperalbuminosis, 20 cells\r\nper c.mm. (lymphocytes and mononuclear cells 95 per cent) and a\r\npositive W. R. Iodide of mercury treatment was given April 18.\r\n\r\nApril 23, the patient went into a coma, with trismus, stiff neck,\r\nKernig’s sign, sluggish pupils, incontinence. He was transferred\r\nto a special hospital, showed on lumbar puncture, April 23, 85 per\r\ncent polynuclear leucocytes, and died April 27. The autopsy showed a\r\nyellowish, quasidiffluent softening of the size of a small egg in the\r\nfirst occipital gyrus on the right side. The authors comment on the\r\nfact that the only objective sign in this case was the variable tendon\r\nreflexes of the lower extremities, “_l’unique cri de souffrance des\r\ncentres nerveux_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly recovery from a spinal cord lesion.\r\n\r\n=Case 111.= (MENDELSSOHN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nMendelssohn reports a soldier, who was sent to a Russian hospital,\r\nApril 12, 1915, with a diagnosis of chronic appendicitis. Operated\r\non next day, the patient appeared to be passing through a normal\r\nconvalescence, when ten days later, he had an intense headache and some\r\ntrouble in vision, which disappeared the next day, only to be followed,\r\ntwo days later, by the patient’s complaint that he could no longer\r\nurinate or rise from bed.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Mendelssohn found a complete flaccid paraplegia with urinary\r\nretention, without fever or pain. Knee-jerks and Achilles jerks were\r\nabsent, and there was a slight extension of the great toe on plantar\r\nstimulation. There was disorder of sensation, with heat sensibility\r\nabolished, painful points poorly localized, and position sense poor.\r\nElectric reactions normal. Pain on pressure in and about the lumbar\r\nvertebral region. Cerebrospinal fluid showed lymphocytosis and an\r\nexcessive albuminosis.\r\n\r\nThis paraplegia lasted six weeks. At the end of May, the patient began\r\nto be able to move his toes and to lift his heel. Improvement was\r\ngradual and progressive. Early in June he could walk if supported.\r\nThe weak knee-jerk then began to reappear and the urinary retention\r\ngradually disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis patient was not hysterical, although a bit emotional. Perhaps,\r\naccording to Mendelssohn, an organic lesion was grafted on a neurosis.\r\nPerhaps the spinal lesion was infectious. At any rate, a presumably\r\norganic paraplegia had recovered in two months and a half.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion: Meningeal hemorrhage: Pneumococcus meningitis.\r\n\r\n=Case 112.= (GUILLAIN AND BARRÉ, August, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 20, came to the Sixth Army Neurological Center, October\r\n13, 1916, as a case of “choluria, due to shell explosion; epistaxis\r\nneeds watching.” He was somnolent, had waked vomiting, pulse 108.\r\nKernig’s sign, defensive movements of the legs on stimulation, with\r\nflexion of leg on thigh and of thigh on pelvis, plantar reflexes\r\nflexor. Puncture showed typical meningeal hemorrhage. Two days later,\r\ntemperature 40, pulse 70, that is to say, a bradycardia in proportion\r\nto the fever. Vomiting, pulse persisted. Next day the patient was\r\nmoaning and semi-delirious and showed stiff neck, Kernig’s sign,\r\naccentuation of vasomotor disorder, plantar response flexor with leg\r\nretracted, thigh flexion both homolateral and contralateral. The\r\nspinal fluid upon the next day, that is, four days after his arrival\r\nat the clinic, showed a purulent fluid in which there was an excess of\r\nalbumin, no sugar, diplococci extracellular (proving on culture to be\r\npneumococci and able to kill a mouse in twenty-four hours).\r\n\r\nAs a rule such hemorrhages remain aseptic, and in fact meningeal\r\nhemorrhage is said by Guillain and Barré to have, as a rule, a\r\nfavorable prognosis. The above described case was the only one of\r\ninfected meningeal hemorrhage that had occurred in the Sixth Army\r\nNeurological Center.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTEBELLUM cortex lesion: right hemiplegia; recovery. Struck by\r\nshrapnel on right shoulder: Athetosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 113.= (BATTEN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA British soldier, aged 27, showed a somewhat remarkable phenomenon.\r\nIt appears that at five years of age, this man had had poliomyelitis,\r\naffecting the left leg. At 20 years of age, he had had pneumonia, and\r\nthis had been followed by a paralysis of the right arm and leg with a\r\nloss of speech. The man recovered from this illness, although he never\r\nquite regained full control of the right hand. It is evident that\r\nthis lack of control was not marked, else the man would not have been\r\nenlisted, and it is Dr. Batten’s opinion that at all events he could\r\nnot have shown pathological movements of the right hand at the time of\r\nenlistment.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, in October, 1914, the soldier was struck on the\r\nright shoulder with shrapnel. Apparently he was not wounded, but\r\nthereafter he was not able to use the right arm well, and in two\r\nmonths’ time he had become unable to manipulate his rifle. On January\r\n13, 1915, he was sent home. The remnants of the old poliomyelitis of\r\nthe left leg were shown in a general weakness of that leg as compared\r\nwith the right. _The movements of the right hand were those seen in\r\nathetosis._ The movements were independent of volition. The patient\r\nhad difficulty in releasing his grasp. He improved rapidly during the\r\nsix weeks he was in hospital, although the movements of the right hand\r\nnever became entirely normal.\r\n\r\nIn this case, according to Batten, “the stress was sufficient to bring\r\ninto prominence the symptoms due to an old cerebral lesion.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical versus thalamic hemianesthesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 114.= (LÉRI, October, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 40, had been suffering for a number of months with pains in\r\nthe left side of the trunk and feelings of weakness in the left arm and\r\nleg. In the summer of 1915 he was on leave and while walking, fell,\r\nlay down, and found he could hardly move his left arm and leg. Two or\r\nthree weeks later he got up, walking with a stick. After some time in\r\nhospital, he was sent back to the trenches, a little weak.\r\n\r\nHe had shortly, however, to be examined neurologically again. He could\r\nhardly raise the left leg and his passive resistance was poor on this\r\nside. The left side was almost completely anesthetic to all forms\r\nof stimulus, although an intense faradic current yielded a feeling\r\nlike that of a fly. Nor was the tactile sensation absolutely nil,\r\nas it could be got with a flat finger on the upper arm and thigh.\r\nCold and heat sensations not well localized. The hemianesthesia was\r\nsharply limited at the median line and affected the buccal, lingual\r\nand nasal mucosa. Deep sensibility was almost abolished on the left\r\nside. Stereognostic sense was lost and the sense of position was lost\r\nabsolutely for hand and foot.\r\n\r\nThe patient said that he heard less well on the left side. There was\r\nalso a slight contraction of the left visual field. The reflexes\r\nwere lively, but equal on both sides. A diagnosis of hysterical\r\nhemianesthesia was apparently called for, but psychoelectric treatment\r\nfailed. The plantar reflex was, in fact, completely absent on the left\r\nside, as well as the corneal reflex. The faradic current failed to\r\nproduce as marked a dilatation of the pupil on the left side as on the\r\nright. The forehead wrinkles were less marked on the left side. The\r\nmouth deviated slightly to the right. The left nasolabial fold was a\r\nlittle less marked. The tongue did not deviate, but was a little narrow\r\non the left side. The palate deviated a little to the left. The left\r\nside of the trunk seemed a little less developed than the right, and\r\nthe scapula stuck a little less closely to the body on the left side,\r\nwhen the arms were raised. The left buttock was a little narrower than\r\nthe right and the left gluteal fold was less marked. In combined\r\nflexion of thigh and trunk the left foot readily left the floor. There\r\nwas a left-sided hypotonia in forced flexion of the forearm. There were\r\nno tremors of the limbs in repose, except a few contractions of the\r\nleft lower extremity. In movement, however, there was a marked tremor\r\nand in coördination the finger to nose test could not be performed.\r\nSpeech was slow and hesitant, sometimes stuttering. Food was sometimes\r\ntaken into the air passages. Headaches were localized on the right\r\nside. They had begun when the first symptoms began. There was mental\r\ndisorder, with gaps in memory. In short, the case is probably one of\r\nthalamic disease, though there were no pains except a few in the left\r\nside of the trunk at the beginning of the disease. The diagnosis of\r\nhysteria was at first made in this case, but the rule that hysterical\r\nhemianesthesia is never found without auto- or hetero-suggestion caused\r\nthe alteration of diagnosis to thalamic.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion: Syndrome suggesting multiple sclerosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 115.= (PITRES AND MARCHAND, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 40, carriage painter, underwent shell-shock at Voquois,\r\nMay 2, 1915, following ten hours’ bombardment. At the time he felt\r\ntinglings. The bombardment had just ceased when he fainted suddenly\r\nwhile repairing a telegraph line. There was no loss of consciousness.\r\nHe could not move his arms or legs, was able to spit, and did not\r\nsuffer at all except for the tingling. He was evacuated to the\r\ninterior, where the diagnosis of psychopathic double paraplegia,\r\nKernig’s sign, zones of anesthesia in the legs, was made. He\r\nwas immediately treated with gray oil, and got an injection of\r\nneosalvarsan, and iodides. He grew slowly better. He could lift a\r\nleg from the bed, but then both legs began to tremble. The arms had\r\nrecovered their movement, before the legs, but always trembled in\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nNovember, 1915, he was able to get up; two months later, he walked\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAt the neurological center, which he entered December 17, his gaze\r\nwas fixed and there was a slight exophthalmos. The folds of the face\r\nwere smoothed out. The nose was deep set (as a result of a fall at the\r\nage of eight). In the upright position he could not remain still, but\r\ntrembled markedly on the left side, so that he had to make a few steps\r\nto keep his balance. He was unable to stand on his left leg. He walked\r\non a broad base, in little steps, and rather unsteadily on account\r\nof tremors augmenting upon movement. General muscular weakness; left\r\nhand slightly weaker than right. He could not lift both legs more than\r\n20 cm. from the bed and in the process they both trembled, trembling\r\ntogether. There was also intention-tremor of the arms, a little less\r\nmarked than that of the legs, of an irregular rhythm. The arms trembled\r\nas a whole. In a state of rest there was no tremor. There was a slight\r\nmuscular stiffness and the patient himself felt difficulty in relaxing.\r\nPatellar reflexes absent, even on reinforcement; Achilles jerks\r\nabsent. Speech monotonous and tremulous, but not scanning; syllable\r\ndoubling observed by the patient. Manuscript tremulous and, on account\r\nof tremors, illegible. Hypalgesia of legs, more marked distally.\r\nDeep sensibility of tendo Achillis and patellar reflexes lost. Pain\r\non compression of eyes diminished. Formication in arms. W. R. of\r\nblood negative. Slow improvement followed and the patient left the\r\nneurological service May 4, 1916, able to walk more easily and without\r\ntremor. The knee-jerks and Achilles jerks were still absent.\r\n\r\nWe here deal with a syndrome in part that of a multiple sclerosis, that\r\nis, the intention-tremor, gait disturbance, muscular rigidity, and\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\n_Re_ multiple sclerosis, Lépine remarks that there are numerous army\r\ncases of pseudo multiple sclerosis which are actually hysterical or\r\nhystero-traumatic cases of hypertonus and tremor. The true cases of\r\nmultiple sclerosis, according to Lépine, are of interest inasmuch as\r\nthey are usually found in officers. These men have apparently at first\r\nbut a slight motor disorder, quite compatible with desk work. We have\r\nusually under-rated the cortical element in multiple sclerosis. Spells\r\nof confusion, delusional ideas, sometimes grandiose, start up without\r\nwarning in these cases. To be sure, alcohol and syphilis sometimes also\r\nenter these cases etiologically. Any case of localized tremor ought to\r\nbe carefully examined psychically, and such cases in general ought not\r\nto be given responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoexistence of hysterical and organic symptoms in two cases of mine\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\n=Cases 116 and 117.= (SMYLY, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was blown up by a mine and rendered unconscious. Upon\r\nrecovery of consciousness, he was dumb, unable to work, very nervous,\r\nparalyzed as to left arm and leg. The paralysis improved so that in\r\nthe hospital at home the patient became able to get about. However, he\r\nthrew his legs about in an unusual fashion. Several months later, the\r\npatient was much improved.\r\n\r\nShortly, however, there was a relapse. Transferred to a hospital for\r\nchronic cases, the patient was unable to walk without assistance on\r\naccount of complete paralysis of the leg. Insomnia, general tremor, and\r\na bad stuttering developed, with a habit of starting in terror at the\r\nslightest noise.\r\n\r\nHypnotic treatment was followed by almost complete disappearance\r\nof the tremor. The patient began to sleep six or seven hours a\r\nnight; nervousness diminished, and the stuttering slowly improved;\r\nbut neither the paralysis nor the anesthesia of the left leg was\r\naffected by suggestion. The leg remained cold, livid, anesthetic, and\r\nflaccidly paralyzed to the hip. Though a slight improvement has since\r\nbeen produced by faradization, the patient still can walk only with\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nA man was injured in 1906 by the fall of a heavy weight on his back. In\r\n1914 he went to France as a soldier, and eight months later was hurled\r\ninto a shell hole so that his back struck the edge. He was rendered\r\nunconscious. Upon recovery of consciousness, the right leg was found to\r\nbe swollen, and there were severe pains in the legs and back.\r\n\r\nSince return home the patient had gone from one hospital to another,\r\nfor the most part unable to walk, suffering from agonizing pain in the\r\nhead and eyes, unable to sleep, and in the night subject to horrible\r\nwaking dreams.\r\n\r\n                                CHART 6\r\n\r\n             MINOR SIGNS OF ORGANIC HEMIPLEGIA (LHERMITTE)\r\n\r\n       I. Hyperextension of forearm (hypotonia).\r\n\r\n      II. Platysma sign: Contraction absent on paralyzed side.\r\n\r\n     III. Babinski’s flexion of thigh on pelvis (spontaneous, upon\r\n          suddenly throwing seated subject into dorsal decubitus).\r\n\r\n      IV.

Heilbronner’s sign of the broad thigh (hypotonia).\r\n\r\n      VI. Rossolimo’s sign: flexion of toes on slight percussion of\r\n          sole.\r\n\r\n     VII.

Oppenheim’s sign (extension of great toe on deep friction\r\n          of calf muscles); or Schaefer, or Gordon (on pinching tendo\r\n          Achillis).\r\n\r\n      IX. Marie-Foix sign: withdrawal of lower leg on transverse\r\n          pressure of tarsus or forced flexion of toes, even when leg\r\n          is incapable of voluntary movement.\r\n\r\nAt first able only to bring himself to an upright position and to rush\r\na few steps, he later acquired considerable control of his feet and\r\nlegs through crutches. The insomnia persisted.\r\n\r\nSmyly regards this case, like Case 116, as more neurological than\r\nmental.\r\n\r\n_Re_ organic neurology, much of great value has been reported.\r\n\r\nSargent and Holmes say that, contrary to expectation, there have been\r\nfew war cases of bad sequelae of cerebral injuries, such as insanity\r\nand epilepsy. During early stages, after infection of the head wounds,\r\nthere is dulness and amnesia, irritability and childishness,--symptoms\r\nwhich disappear during and after repair of the wounds. Mental disorder\r\nrequiring internment is surprisingly rare. During 12 months only eight\r\ncases were transferred from the head hospital in a year to the Napsbury\r\nwar hospital, where cases of insanity attributable to the service are\r\nsent; and in but two of these could the persisting mental symptoms be\r\nattributed to head injury.\r\n\r\nCol. F. W. Mott confirms the opinion of Col. Sargent and Col. Holmes,\r\nremarking that from all the London County Council Asylums, only one\r\ncase of insanity associated with gunshot head wound had been admitted,\r\nand that this was one of a Belgian who died from septic infection\r\nof the cerebral ventricles. Yet all cases of insanity in invalided\r\nsoldiers belonging to the London County Council area (about one-seventh\r\nof the population of the United Kingdom) are transferred to these\r\nasylums.\r\n\r\nAgain Sargent and Holmes point out that both generalized and Jacksonian\r\nepileptiform seizures are comparatively rare in patients suffering from\r\nrecent head wounds; even convulsions in later stages have been as yet\r\nless common than was feared. Thus, after evacuation to England, fits\r\noccurred in 37 (6 per cent) of 610 cases with complete notes, and in\r\nonly eleven of these 37 cases were the convulsions frequent. Sargent\r\nand Holmes remark, however, that the practice of giving bromides\r\nregularly to all serious cranial injuries until the wound is healed,\r\nand for some months afterwards, seems advisable. In 33 of the 37\r\nconvulsive cases there have been severe compound fractures of the\r\nskull, and in four of these a missile was still present in the brain.\r\nFive secondary operations were performed with good results, after\r\ndrainage of small abscesses in two and removal of spicules of bone in\r\nthree. The In-patient and Out-patient records of the National Hospital\r\nfor the Paralyzed and Epileptic were searched for epileptics already\r\ndischarged from the army, but notes of but two patients attending this\r\nhospital for epilepsy were found.\r\n\r\nAs for other neurological complications aside from septic infection\r\nand hernia formation, there are a few subjective symptoms that may\r\nnecessitate the invaliding of soldiers. The most common of these is\r\nheadache, usually in the form of a feeling of weight, pressure, or\r\nthrobbing in the head, which headache is increased by noise, fatigue,\r\nexertion, or emotion. Attacks of dizziness also occur, and nervousness\r\nor deficient control over emotions and feelings. Changes of temperament\r\nare found in some soldiers, who become depressed, moody, irritable, or\r\nemotional, and unable to concentrate attention.\r\n\r\nFoix, under the direction of P. Marie, worked upon aphasia in 100\r\ncases, reporting results at a surgical and neurological meeting, May\r\n24, 1916, in Paris. Only lesions on the left side of the brain have\r\nproduced important and lasting speech disorder, although lesions on the\r\nleft side may leave behind them a little dysarthria or difficulty in\r\nfinding words in conversation. It is, of course, hard to tell speech\r\ndisorder from stupor or clouding of consciousness. Foix notes certain\r\nspecialties in speech defect according to which region of the left\r\nbrain is affected.\r\n\r\nFirst: Prefrontal lesions produce a transient dysarthria, lasting but\r\na few weeks, and right-sided prefrontal lesions produce just as much\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nOccipital lesions produce no speech disorder.\r\n\r\nSecond: Patients with right-sided hemianopsia due to lesions of\r\noccipital regions were not aphasic and could read or write perfectly.\r\nLesions of the left visual centers certainly do not affect reading.\r\nIf, however, the injury is not to the visual centers, but is upon the\r\nlateral part of the occipital lobe, then alexic phenomena appear, and\r\nthese the more the lesion approaches the temporal-parietal region.\r\n\r\nThird: Central convolutional lesion produces a variety of disorders\r\naccording to the site and extent of the lesion. There is no aphasia\r\nwith the crural monoplegia due to superior paracentral disorder. But\r\nslight aphasic disorder accompanies the brachial monoplegia of middle\r\ncentral lesion, though writing, reading, and calculation are slightly\r\naffected, and the more so the more the lesion extends posteriorly to\r\nthe stereognostic regions. The lower down in the precentral region the\r\nlesion appears, the more likely is the Broca syndrome to be observed.\r\nBut if the hemiplegia is chiefly a brachial monoplegia, the aphasic\r\ndisorder may remain slight, involving reading, writing, understanding\r\nof words, the spoken word, articulation, and calculation.\r\n\r\nFourth: Lesions of the lateral-frontal region produce more or less\r\nmarked aphasic disorder, just as do those of the inferior part of the\r\nprecentral gyrus. This aphasia is more apt to occur when the wound is\r\ndeep. However, no case of permanent aphasia has been observed in cases\r\nof lesion of the lateral-frontal region (termed in Foix’s nomenclature,\r\nthe precentral region, but referring to the tissues in front of\r\nthe precentral (or ascending frontal) gyrus of the more familiar\r\nnomenclature). Almost absolute, or absolute, anarthria follows the\r\nwound, and the patient is hemiplegic. This hemiplegia may last from ten\r\ndays to two or three months. After a time there is no longer more than\r\na slight dysarthria, and writing becomes good again; reading remains,\r\nperhaps, a little difficult. A complete or almost complete cure is the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nFifth: When the retrocentral region is injured, various aphasic\r\nsyndromes appear. The retrocentral region is the parietal-temporal lobe\r\nexcept the superior part of the parietal lobe and the anterior part\r\nof the temporal lobe, which latter two regions when injured do not\r\nallow any marked aphasic disorder. Lesions of the middle or posterior\r\ntemporal region are particularly important for speech, and produce more\r\nmarked disorder than lesions of the angular gyrus or the supramarginal\r\ngyrus. At first, words cannot be spoken, for a period of a fortnight\r\nto three months. Speech returns progressively, with an increased power\r\nof comprehension. At the same time, the patients begin to read and\r\nwrite. But there is no further spontaneous progress after a period of\r\nsix or eight months, and then special reëducation must be started.\r\nThese speech disorders of retrocentral (parietal-temporal) origin are\r\neither aphasic syndromes or slight remains of psychical disorders,\r\nor again, a disorder practically limited to alexia. The true aphasic\r\nsyndromes concern the spoken word, understanding the words, writing,\r\nand calculation. The disorder is not especially dysarthric and consists\r\nparticularly in loss of vocabulary. It might be called an amnestic\r\naphasia (Pitres). These cases have well-marked intellectual disorder\r\nand their power of calculation is especially poor. As to the aphasic\r\ntraces, which are more important to understand than they are extensive\r\nin point of fact, they relate particularly to calculating power, to\r\nvocabulary (slowness in finding words), and to reading (reading without\r\ncomprehension). As to the cases of alexia, these are cases of lesions\r\nof the posterior part of the parietal-temporal lobe, and are usually\r\naccompanied by a hemi- or a quadrantanopsia.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, cases with central lesions (precentral and postcentral\r\ngyrus) have hemiplegia and a Broca aphasia without much tendency to\r\ncure. Cases with lesions anterior to the central convolutions have a\r\ntransient anarthria and their recovery is ordinarily complete. Cases\r\nwith retrocentral lesions have an aphasia suggestive of Wernicke’s\r\naphasia, and ordinarily leave behind them extensive defects in\r\nintelligence and language. These cases should be taken account of\r\nfrom the standpoint of compensation, since they are much worse off\r\nfor work than many cases with amputations; and though their disorder\r\nlooks slight, it quite interferes with working at a trade. From the\r\npoint of view of military effectiveness, the retrocentral cases are not\r\nvery good soldiers, and especially not good officers, as they do not\r\nunderstand commands completely.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeuropsychiatric phenomena in rabies.\r\n\r\n=Case 118.= (GRENIER DE CARDENAL, LEGRAND, BENOIT, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA farmer, 34, mobilized in veterinary work, fell sick at a station\r\nfor sick horses, April 25, 1917. He breakfasted well, drank coffee,\r\nand went to the _abreuvoir_ at eleven o’clock. He told his mates that\r\nhe felt bad in his head. He fainted over a table at the eating house,\r\nrefused to eat or drink. At noon he went out into the court, vomited\r\nand went to lie down. A physician thought he was suffering from angina\r\nbecause of the pronounced dysphagia. He entered the hospital at eleven\r\no’clock at night on the 25th. He was found next morning on his back,\r\nwith a fixed and haggard look, crimson face, masseter and phalangeal\r\nspasm at times. Respiration irregular, interrupted by moans. The pulse\r\nwould go up to 120 during agitation and then go down to 50 as soon as\r\nthe patient lay down again. Pupils slightly dilated and unequal. As\r\nthe patient came from a sick horse dépôt, the first question was that\r\nof tetanus, suggested somewhat by the jactitation of the limbs and\r\nthe trismus. A violent headache began and the patient cried out, “My\r\nhead! My head!” Painful vomiting movements, with very slight bilious\r\nmaterial. Convulsive movements increased. The pulse was slow. The\r\ndiagnosis “meningitis” was suggested, despite the absence of fever\r\nand the absence of Kernig’s sign. Lumbar puncture gave limpid fluid\r\nwith a normal lymphocytosis, without increase of albumin or reducing\r\nsubstance. The bacteriological smear and culture were negative.\r\n\r\nSoon another sort of symptoms appeared. The patient would rise, cry\r\nout, threaten his neighbors. He was calmed with morphine. There were\r\nperiods of excitement alternating with periods of calmness, during\r\nwhich he would reply sharply but accurately, being somewhat vexed by\r\nthe questions, and would walk up and down without offering a word. When\r\na glass of water was offered to him, as soon as his glance met the\r\nglass his eyes expressed fear. He drew back in repulsion and cried out\r\nin terror. When the liquid was out of his sight the hydrophobic spasm\r\nceased. This hyperesthesia of the sensorium was so intense that the\r\nmere sight of the shining glassware of the laboratory brought out a\r\nsharp crisis.\r\n\r\nHe was sent that evening to the neuropsychiatry center, walking jerkily\r\nand as if slightly drunk, with a number of small gesticulations and\r\nmurmurings. He was immediately isolated, undressed himself and went\r\nto bed. He did not move in his bed, and seemed to sleep. The next day\r\nhe got up, dressed and had a small spell of excitement, but was quiet\r\nenough on the medical visit, though the floor was soiled with urine\r\nand vomitus and the clothing was in disorder. He now had a pronounced\r\nphase, deep sunk eyes, drawn features and anxious look; dilated pupils\r\nand an expression of mixed fear and anger. His breathing was hard and\r\nhe kept his hand on his heart. He was oriented. He suddenly rose and\r\nsaid, “I am thirsty.” A glass of milk was given him. He hesitated a\r\nmoment, plunged his mouth and hands into it and aspirated the drink\r\nwithout making any swallowing movements. He pushed away the glass, spat\r\na little, and vomited a small quantity of a black liquid. Then followed\r\nan anxious crisis, and he fell upon his side, absolutely immobile,\r\nwithout breathing for a few seconds. Again in the sitting posture, he\r\nwas taken with contractions of the limbs and face. The tendon reflexes\r\nwere at this time normal.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later the attendant found him dead, in the sitting\r\nposture, leaning against the wall, mouth open, arms dependent, hands\r\nextended, pupils dilated--a death in syncope. The brain was found\r\ncongested. There was a slight effusion of blood over the posterior\r\naspect of the brain. There were no hemorrhages or softenings in the\r\nbrain substance. The muscles were of a dark red to black. The adherent\r\nlungs were very slightly congested at the base. The stomach contained\r\na quarter of a liter of black, inodorous fluid in which there was\r\nmuch bile and little blood. There were numerous small hemorrhages of\r\nthe mucosa near the great curvature. The spleen was large, the liver\r\ncongested. The Pasteur Institute confirmed the diagnosis of rabies.\r\nThere is no history of the man’s having been bitten by a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nTetanus: Psychosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 119.= (LUMIÈRE AND ASTIER, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier wounded May 18, 1916, was given antitetanic serum May 26th.\r\nThe wounds healed, but on June 16, that is, 29 days after the trauma,\r\ncontractures began, at first localized. There had been numerous wounds\r\nof legs and scrotum by shell fragments and the contractures were\r\nlimited to the right leg and scrotum. There was no trismus or any\r\nlumbar symptom.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days the contractures became general, the\r\ntemperature rose, a shell fragment was found by X-ray at the root\r\nof the thigh and was surgically extracted. B. tetani was found upon\r\ninoculation of media with material from the shell fragment. Persulphide\r\nof soda and antitetanic serum 90 cc. in three days were given\r\nintravenously. The temperature fell and the general health was greatly\r\nimproved. July 6, hallucinations and terrors, worse at night, set in.\r\nThe man believed himself surrounded by flames, that daggers were being\r\nplunged into his old wounds, that his hair was being pulled. These\r\nsymptoms lasted a fortnight only, whereupon the patient recovered.\r\n\r\nThis case and six others accompanied by cerebral disturbances all\r\nrecovered, and all the patients retained a perfect memory of their\r\ndelirium and of their hallucinations.\r\n\r\nThe chronological distribution of these cases was odd. One case was\r\nfound early in the war; then no other cases of cerebral disorder\r\npresented themselves until the group observed at the end of 1916.\r\nBesides flames and daggers, zoöpsia was several times observed. One of\r\nthe cases showed these symptoms without having been given antitetanic\r\nserum.\r\n\r\n_Re_ tetanus in the war, see in the _Collection Horizon_ a book by\r\nCourtois-Suffit and Giroux on _Les formes anormales du tétanos_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTetanus fruste versus hysteria.\r\n\r\n=Case 120.= (CLAUDE AND LHERMITTE, 1915.)\r\n\r\nClaude and Lhermitte describe a condition of _tetanos fruste_. The neck\r\nwas absolutely rigid. The patient had not been wounded in any way and,\r\nbeing regarded as a pure neuropath, was sent to the Centre Neurologique\r\nat Bourges.\r\n\r\nThe differential diagnosis lay between true tetanus and the hysterical\r\npseudotetanus or pseudomeningitis. In pseudotetanus there is a\r\ncontracture of the superficial and deep neck muscles, especially the\r\ntrapezii, sternomastoid, and deep muscles. The condition somewhat\r\nsuggests that of acute meningitis or tetanus, and especially suggests\r\ntetanus because it is often associated with masseter contracture\r\n(hysterical trismus). The head is immobile, stiff, and inclined\r\nbackward; eyes directed above, throat slightly prominent. Upon attempts\r\nto move the head, intense pain occurs. The pain and contracture\r\nsometimes even suggest a suboccipital Pott’s disease. This form of\r\nhysterical pseudotetanus is of sudden onset, as a rule following burial\r\nin a trench or else contusion, or a slight wound in the cervical\r\nregion. Pressure on the spinous processes produces no pain, nor does a\r\nblow upon the head; and an X-ray examination will definitely eliminate\r\nthe hypothesis of Pott’s disease.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Claude-Lhermitte case of limited true tetanus:\r\nIt showed marked modifications in the tendon and bone reflexes.\r\nUpon percussion of the zygoma, of the occiput, or of the clavicle,\r\nthere was a marked further contraction in the contractured muscles.\r\nAlthough there was no apparent spasticity in the legs, there was an\r\nankle clonus and a bilateral patella clonus, combined with a distinct\r\nexaggeration of all bone and tendon reflexes. In such cases also there\r\nis hyperexcitability of the nerves and muscles to faradic and galvanic\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn officer’s letter concerning local tetanus.\r\n\r\n=Case 121.= (TURRELL, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nThe following letter from an officer who had had local tetanus and was\r\ntreated by Turrell by ionization Dec. 6 and 7, 1915, by diathermia Dec.\r\n7 to 22, and occasionally by static breeze ionization and chlorine\r\nion to relieve contractions from Dec. 29, 1915, to Feb. 4, 1916. The\r\ntetanus was in the muscles of the legs. Of course diathermia is a\r\npurely symptomatic treatment and does not replace antitoxin serum or\r\nother specific treatment; thus its effect in relieving the contractions\r\nof local tetanus is precisely like its effect in the treatment of\r\nsciatic neuritis or lumbago.\r\n\r\n                                                   November 15, 1916.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Major Turrell,\r\n\r\n    “I have been meaning to write to you for some time, as I knew\r\n    you would be interested to hear how I was getting on. Your\r\n    letter has just been received, and I am only too happy to give\r\n    you any information I can with regard to my leg. I was wounded\r\n    in the left leg on October 13, 1915, by high explosive shell,\r\n    and arrived at Oxford on October 22. There was no operation as\r\n    the surgeon in charge did not consider it advisable to remove\r\n    the pieces of shell: my leg seemed to be getting better, and\r\n    after about a month I was able to hobble round with sticks. My\r\n    foot at this time used to swell a great deal towards night,\r\n    and the foot seemed then to gradually stiffen up with violent\r\n    pains at intervals, this gradually spread up the whole leg to\r\n    about the knee, and I was compelled to take to my bed again.\r\n    The pain at times was very bad, similar to a very bad attack of\r\n    cramps, and then my leg became rigid and stiff, and at other\r\n    times used to get horrible jumps and it was impossible to keep\r\n    it still, and whenever the doctor or nurse looked at it it\r\n    used to stiffen up at once. The night seemed to be the worst,\r\n    and consequently I got very little sleep. I often had to get\r\n    up in the middle of the night on crutches to try and obtain\r\n    relief, my leg was so cramped and sore. It was about this time\r\n    that you first visited me and prescribed a course of electric\r\n    treatment for my leg, and I shall never be able to thank you\r\n    enough for the relief it gave me. I cannot remember the names\r\n    of the different treatments, but the first one--diathermy, or\r\n    heat pads--certainly relieved the pain, and after the first\r\n    two or three visits to you I got immense relief. I never\r\n    looked back after this, and, although the progress was slow, I\r\n    gradually lost all pain and was able to get sleep at night. The\r\n    nervous jumps slowly disappeared and my leg became gradually\r\n    normal except for contraction of the tendons. I was unable to\r\n    straighten my ankle or knee, and it was thought at one time\r\n    that my tendo Achillis would have to be severed. Gradually\r\n    the knee straightened and I was able to get my heel to the\r\n    ground. I was for some time on crutches, and was able to leave\r\n    the hospital on February 5, 1916, walking with sticks.… I am\r\n    now able to walk comfortably, but am unable to flex the ankle\r\n    more than at right angle to my leg. The circulation is not\r\n    very good, and I feel anything tight round my calf. I am still\r\n    getting Boards, and have not been passed fit for overseas yet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. SOMATOPSYCHOSES\r\n\r\n(THE SYMPTOMATIC, NON-NERVOUS, GROUP)\r\n\r\n\r\nDysentery: Psychosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 122.= (LOEWY, November, 1915.)\r\n\r\nOut of a large number of dysentery patients, many of whom had very\r\nserious symptoms, but one of Loewy’s patients became psychotic.\r\nLoewy in fact had discharged this one as normal, and he had been put\r\non the wagon train (no opium or alcohol) to go to a sanatorium. As\r\nthe fighting shifted, the sanatorium site changed and could not be\r\nreached with the wagon. Finally, the wagon train met the battalion\r\nonce more and Loewy was told that the man was “dying.” At this time he\r\nwas afebrile, without collapse symptoms, with a strong and normally\r\nfrequent pulse, and with few signs of exhaustion. Yet the guard had\r\nthought that he looked moribund. Both upper eyelids were drawn rigidly\r\nup but conveyed a different impression from that in maniacal or\r\nanxious conditions. The expression was that of staring astonishment,\r\nhelplessness, and apathetic lack of orientation. The patient recognized\r\nLoewy, spoke to him as “Herr Doctor,” said he was doing quite well;\r\nhe was found to be well oriented. There was no fabricating tendency\r\neven as to the number of stools (although Loewy had noted such in\r\nbad dysenteries of the _Shiga-Kruse_ type). He was apparently hard\r\nof hearing, as if at the beginning of a typhoid fever. He showed a\r\nretardation in his intake of ideas, and his voice in answering sounded\r\nabsent-minded. There was an expression of absent-mindedness, and the\r\npatient seemed markedly unconcerned about his health, the direction of\r\nthe journey, the terrible rain, etc. These phenomena are attributed by\r\nLoewy to attention disorder.\r\n\r\nThe patient had been out of reach of fire for days. Loewy reports the\r\ncase as one of beginning amentia or as an exhausted state resembling a\r\nKorsakow condition, recalling one of emotional hyperesthetic weakness\r\n(Bonhoeffer).\r\n\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever: Hysteria.\r\n\r\n=Case 123.= (STERZ, December, 1914.)\r\n\r\nA soldier entering hospital for typhoid fever, October 2, 1914, was\r\ndischarged to another hospital and again, November 10, to a hospital\r\nfor nervous disease. The typhoid was serious and complicated by\r\ndelirium. After defervescence, the patient was weak and could not stand\r\nor walk, especially on account of pains and weakness in the left leg.\r\nSometimes he had had pains in the sacrum and left hip. He complained\r\nof tinnitus, deafness, dizziness, headache. He said he had fallen from\r\na cart, had been sick for three months, since which time he had been\r\nunder medical treatment for his present condition. He had, he said,\r\nbeen given a small pension.\r\n\r\nThe gait disorder sometimes amounted to a real astasia-abasia. The\r\nleft leg became stiff and was dragged behind. There was a paresis\r\ndemonstrable in dorsal decubitus, of the left side, especially of the\r\nleg, without atrophy. There was a hypesthesia of the whole left side\r\nof the body, with the exception of the head. Hyperesthesia of the left\r\nleg, hip and upper sacrum. The left corneal reflex was diminished.\r\nMoody, hypochondriacal, lachrymose. The general attitude of the patient\r\nwas affected and theatrical. Paradoxical innervations were frequently\r\nfound on test. There was no neurological disorder except for the\r\nabsence of the right Achilles jerk.\r\n\r\nThe absence of this Achilles jerk may be regarded as a residuum of the\r\nprevious accident. The localization of the pains points to a neurotic\r\nlumbosacral plexus disorder on the left side. Superimposed upon this\r\npicture are the hysterical phenomena. The typhoid fever and its\r\nattendant neuritis are therefore to be interpreted as the liberating\r\nfactor for a severe hysteria in a subject already disposed to such\r\nsymptoms through previous accident.\r\n\r\n\r\nDementia praecox versus post-typhoidal encephalitis.\r\n\r\n=Case 124.= (NORDMAN, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA butcher, 29 (aunt insane, sister melancholy, one child stillborn,\r\ndeformed), had had several days convulsions at eight; went through\r\nmilitary service without incident; was at the Marne and was evacuated\r\nOctober 19, 1914, with typhoid fever,--a severe fever with a delirium\r\nprolonged into the last weeks. Three months convalescent leave was\r\ngiven, passed at Paris with the man’s aunt, but he had become strange.\r\nOne day he wanted to strangle neighbors of German origin; another day\r\ndeparted for Dunkirk and then returned, having lost all his documents.\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1915, he went back to the front, did strange things and was\r\nsoon evacuated to Tarascon. In April he went back to his dépôt; May 18,\r\nto the hospital at Rennes for erythema. June 15, he was given 15 days\r\nin prison for setting off a cannon too quickly and then running off\r\nthrough the fields. August 11, he was interned at Rennes for stealing\r\na priest’s cap. September 12, two months convalescence. December 10,\r\nheadaches. Back to Rennes January 14, February 18, Val-de-Grâce, then\r\nMaison Blanche.\r\n\r\nHere he was found sometimes sad, immobile; at other times laughing and\r\nsinging. He was very irritable on small occasion. Once on leave he\r\nhad a fugue with complete amnesia, though alcohol may account for the\r\nlatter. His memory was vague, especially for his crimes and for recent\r\nevents. He was emotional, indifferent even in the presence of his wife\r\nor aunt. Sexual indifference. He often complained of his head, saying\r\nthat he felt it blocked and that he could not think. The headache was\r\nfrontal and would last several hours. The man would, however, not\r\ncomplain spontaneously. He was physically, in general, negative.\r\n\r\nThis case might possibly be due to a post-typhoidal encephalitis, but\r\nNordman believes rather that it is a case of dementia praecox. Perhaps\r\nthe convulsions at eight produced a slight brain lesion, brought to an\r\nissue by the typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nParatyphoid fever: Psychosis outlasting fever.\r\n\r\n=Case 125.= (MERKLEN, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Breton farmer, 34, had paratyphoid alpha. Admitted to hospital\r\nSeptember 3, 1915, he had headache, anorexia, asthenia, coated tongue\r\nand tense abdomen, algosuria; later, abdominal swelling, borborygmi in\r\nthe right iliac fossa, rose spots, dicrotism, albuminuria, bronchitic\r\nrales. The disease was severe, and was complicated by sacral decubitus\r\nand ran a month.\r\n\r\nAt first somnolent, September 8th the patient went into a state of\r\nmental excitement with agitation and delirium. He got out of bed, cried\r\nout, sang, talked to his neighbors, complained that his papers (colis)\r\nhad been stolen, as well as his watch and tobacco; that his horses’\r\nhoofs had been injured, and the like.\r\n\r\nHe grew calmer in a few days, and now no longer tried to get up,\r\nremaining inert in his bed. The occupation delirium persisted--he was\r\nnot being paid what he owed, and the like. He had hallucinations;\r\nlooked for scissors, and one day said, “Here they are!” At intervals he\r\nappeared lucid and responded appropriately to questions.\r\n\r\nThe fever dropped and the paratyphoid disease appeared past, but the\r\nmental state remained for three weeks without change, having the same\r\nperiods of lucidity when he would be regarded as cured, but falling\r\nagain forthwith into his post oniric ideas. He was soon sent to a\r\nconvalescent hospital and was not wholly well for another month.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychopathic taint brought out by paratyphoid fever.\r\n\r\n=Case 126.= (MERKLEN, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 31, was a victim of paratyphoid alpha, entering hospital\r\nOctober 21, 1915, with the usual symptomatology: fever, asthenia,\r\nheadache, abdominal swelling, tongue coated and red along its edges,\r\ndiarrhoea. After admission he passed into a deep toxic state.\r\n\r\nHe woke up in the night with a cry, got up afraid, and refused to go\r\nback into his own bed. He was mute, except for curses addressed to the\r\nnurses. After two hours he went to bed and to sleep. Next day he sat\r\nquietly with a depressed look, occasionally groaning deeply, talking in\r\nbrief phrases about his anxiety, wanting his wife telephoned to, saying\r\nthat he would not see his children, was going into the four planks, and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\nThis situation lasted about a week. He became afraid of medicines and\r\nthought he had been poisoned, saying that he would rather be shot\r\nthan poisoned and complaining that, though he had served France for\r\nfourteen months, they now wanted to kill him. In the night time he\r\nwas agitated. He gave vent to cries, and threats, but this delirious\r\nstate rapidly decreased and he became calm the night of September 27th.\r\nThe upper extremities showed a tendency to catatonia. From this time\r\nforth, during the remaining month, the patient was immobile, mute,\r\nfearful, and mistrusting, depressed and always wore a cunning look. His\r\ndisorientation decreased and he passed good nights. He would answer\r\nquestions by groaning. He would say, “They think I am a Tartar.” The\r\nend of the mental disorder coincided with the cure of the paratyphoid\r\nfever. According to Merklen, the paratyphoid bacillus in these cases\r\nserves to bring out a psychopathic taint. This particular patient had\r\nalways been of a sad demeanor, uncommunicative, very impressionable and\r\nemotional. Two other cases had always been somewhat below normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiphtheria: Post-diphtheritic symptoms.\r\n\r\n=Case 127.= (MARCHAND, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA farmer, 37, was evacuated March 20, 1916, for diphtheria. April 1,\r\nparalysis of tongue and uvula, impairment of vision. These symptoms\r\nrapidly improved, but paralysis of the legs appeared and then of the\r\narms. This paralysis lasted until he was sent to the neurological\r\ncenter June 28 for post-diphtheritic paralysis, wherein it was found\r\nthat voluntary movements of the legs could be performed, though\r\npainfully and of slight extent, that walking was impossible, that there\r\nwas a considerable atrophy of legs and arms, that the knee-jerks,\r\nAchilles jerks and plantar reflexes were absent. There was complaint of\r\npains in the legs and over nerve trunks.\r\n\r\nImprovement followed, the atrophy gradually passed away, and the\r\nvoluntary movements of the legs became more extensive; but by October\r\nthe reflexes had not yet reappeared. Yet the patient had begun to\r\nwalk on crutches and soon was able to get on with canes only. The\r\nimprovement did not continue. He did not raise his heels and dragged\r\nhis toes. There was now a clonic tremor of the legs as soon as the\r\nweight of the body was put on them. During movements of legs carried\r\non in dorsal decubitus there was found an irregular tremor of the legs\r\nwith twisting of the trunk. The muscular strength was well preserved.\r\nThere was a slight muscular atrophy. The tendon reflexes had now come\r\nback, though the right Achilles jerk was weak and the plantar reflexes\r\nwere absent. There was a hypalgesia of the legs which ceased sharply\r\nat the middle of the thighs. There was a slight hypoacusia on the left\r\nside. Visual fields normal. The patient complained of feelings in the\r\ninside of his bones. Electrical reactions normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiphtheria: Hysterical paraparesis.\r\n\r\n=Case 128.= (MARCHAND, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 24, was evacuated June 24, 1915, from Roussy for diphtheria\r\nand was treated by serum, receiving 80 cc. in 8 injections. A few\r\ndays later there was a paralysis of the uvula with regurgitation of\r\nliquids from the nose; but patient was able to go on convalescence July\r\n21. A few days later, however, he noticed that his legs were weak.\r\nVertigo, vomiting and painful walking followed, and his convalescence\r\nwas increased a month. The paralysis got progressively worse.\r\nSeptember 10, he went by automobile to Libourne where he stayed two\r\nmonths. He arrived at the Neurological Center at Bordeaux November 9\r\nwith diagnosis “polyneuritis of legs.” He could not walk and could\r\nhardly flex thighs on pelvis or legs on thighs. Voluntary movements\r\nof extension and flexion of feet and toes were limited. There was\r\nneither atrophy, pain nor reflex disorder. Both legs were analgesic,\r\nas was also the abdomen up to the umbilicus. There was complaint of\r\ndorsolumbar pains and of stomach trouble and lack of appetite; vomiting\r\nafter meals frequent, pulse 120.\r\n\r\nJanuary 3, the patient was able to lift his legs a few centimeters\r\nabove the bed but not together. There was now a slight muscular atrophy\r\nespecially on the left side. Knee-jerks lively, analgesia limited to\r\nlegs, no vomiting, pulse rapid.\r\n\r\nThe patient was sent to a hospital in the country May 8 to July 8. He\r\nwas now much better. His legs were able to support his body but he\r\ncould not walk. Slight atrophy of left leg. There was hypalgesia now in\r\nthe feet and legs below the knee. There was no pain on pressure over\r\nthe nerve trunks. The electric reactions normal. The patient could now\r\nwalk on crutches. He was invalided on the temporary basis, December 12,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that in this case the hysterical paralysis was\r\npreceded by polyneuritis.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaria: Amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 129.= (DE BRUN, November, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier lost all memory of his hospital stay in Salonica and the\r\nvoyage home. He could only remember a little about the hospital at\r\nBandol. There is a period of transition to full memory in malarial\r\ncases characterized by sure memory, vague on certain points,\r\nalternating with phases of almost complete amnesia. The soldier\r\nin question had very inexact memories of the Bandol Hospital, and\r\ncould only remember about his fevers, that they began about noon and\r\nterminated about four o’clock. Twice he had been found in his shirt,\r\nwalking, unconscious, in the passageway of the hospital. Having\r\nobtained leave for convalescence, three months after his memory gap\r\nbegan, he went to Paris, and probably had attacks at home. He vaguely\r\nremembered afterward being carried by automobile to the Pasteur\r\nHospital, December 1. There he remained to the end of March, 1917,\r\nwithout preserving anything but the vaguest memories of an intermediary\r\nperiod of more than six months. The memory in these malarial cases\r\noften remains permanently altered and there may even be a retrograde\r\namnesia, carrying back to facts prior to the gap and an anterograde\r\namnesia relative to facts after the main gap.\r\n\r\nThus, there is in the febrile period a retrograde amnesia and in the\r\npost-febrile period a retrograde or anterograde amnesia. One group of\r\nsubjects are severe cerebral cases, and the memory gap appears to run\r\nback to a period of true mental confusion. But there is another group\r\nof patients who preserve throughout the febrile period an absolute\r\nconsciousness of all acts, and yet the memory gap is just as sharp and\r\ndefinite as in the confusional cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaria: Korsakow syndrome.\r\n\r\n=Case 130.= (CARLILL, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA stoker, 45, was admitted to the Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar,\r\nNovember 6, 1916, from the Fifteenth General Hospital in Alexandria, to\r\nwhich he had come from a hospital in Bombay about three weeks before.\r\nAt Alexandria he was anemic and showed an edema of legs which had been\r\npresent for six weeks. Cylindruria; no albuminuria. At Haslar there was\r\nno cylindruria and no edema, and nothing but weakness, gouty arthritis\r\nof left wrist, right ear and left great toe. Red cells 4,650,000,\r\nleucocytes 10,000 (52 per cent polymorphonuclear, 46 per cent\r\nlymphocytes). He was rather dull mentally. December 10th, Dr. Fildes\r\nfound malarial organisms in the blood on the occasion of a hyperpyrexia\r\n(104°). Quinine was given. December 14th, he was transferred\r\nneurological. According to the patient’s own story, he was born June\r\n10, 1868, lived in Fulham, had a daughter aged 12 years, had recently\r\nseen his wife at the hospital: all this seemed plausible enough.\r\n\r\nLater, however, he said that the year was 1899, that King Edward was\r\nking, that the war was between England and some field forces, etc. This\r\nwell-nourished, pale, simple-looking stoker spoke quietly and politely;\r\ntold about intermittent fever; about being eight years on the active\r\nlist, becoming a reservist and being called up for the war. He read\r\nintelligently, could do sums, but did not know the name of the hospital\r\nand was confused about the war. He recognized that his memory was not\r\nas it should be; constantly stroked his moustache and chin. He was\r\nhappy and contented.\r\n\r\nThe gait was normal, systolic blood pressure 140 mm.; no evidence of\r\nalcoholism. Blood, January 15, 1917, contained 5,050,000 reds, 10,300\r\nleucocytes (63 per cent polymorphonuclear, 37 per cent lymphocytes).\r\nThere was a bilateral absence of the ankle-jerks, repeatedly confirmed\r\nat subsequent examinations. Wassermann reaction was negative. Puncture\r\nfluid contained no cells.\r\n\r\nInstead of living at Fulham, this stoker lived at Portsmouth, and had\r\nnot been seen by his wife for four years. He had done 18 years’ active\r\nservice and had last sent his wife a letter from the Sailors’ Home\r\nat Bombay, November, 1916. They had been married 21 years. He caused\r\nastonishment with his wife and friends by announcing that Lord Roberts\r\nand General Buller were in command at the battle of the Falklands.\r\nHe continued to say that he lived at Fulham. He was discharged home,\r\nJanuary 22. It seems as if he were living through the period of the\r\nBoer war.\r\n\r\nCarlill considers that alcoholism may be ruled out, and there is no\r\nlikelihood that the gout was the cause of the neuritis. He believes\r\nthat the neuritis was probably malarial. Possibly the illness suffered\r\nin Bombay may have been beriberi or it may have been malarial\r\nnephritis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA complication of malaria.\r\n\r\n=Case 131.= (BLIN, August, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA Senegalese corporal of machine gunners, 21 (early life normal save\r\nfor sore throats and coughing), was a robust, well-developed man of 75\r\nkilos when he entered the hospital at Konakry, February 15, 1916. He\r\nwas given the diagnosis: malarial anterior spinal paralysis.\r\n\r\nIt seems that he had joined a Colonial regiment, April 8, 1915,\r\nattended classes as a recruit, left Bordeaux November 1 for Dakar,\r\narriving there November 11. He stayed there some sixteen days, during\r\nwhich time he slept without mosquito-netting. November 16, he left for\r\nKonakry, and had his first febrile symptoms November 27, with vomiting,\r\nheadache, and prostration. His temperature ran as high as 41, but by\r\nDecember had fallen to normal, after quinine.\r\n\r\nThe corporal was sent away, cured, to his company at Kouronesa,\r\nDecember 6. There was more fever, headache, and vomiting during the\r\nrailway trip. Quinine again relieved the fever, but a bloody diarrhoea\r\nset in so that it was only at the end of January that he could go on\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, another attack of fever, with shivering and perspiration,\r\nlasted for some three hours. He could hardly stand by himself and had\r\nto be helped in walking. Next day, another spell of three hours of\r\nfever; definite paralysis set in, affecting both legs. February 8 the\r\narms were attacked by paralysis which, unlike that of the legs, was a\r\nprogressive one, attacking first the shoulders, then the elbows, the\r\nwrists, and finally the hands. All the body muscles were in a state\r\nof flaccid paralysis, as well as the muscles of the face. The patient\r\nwas now afebrile. February 9 there was a slight speech defect; the\r\ntongue was slightly paralyzed, and swallowing became painful. The jaw\r\nmovements remained normal. The muscles of the face were intact and the\r\npatient could whistle, move his lips, and move his eyeballs normally.\r\nVision normal. The pupils were fixed in dilatation, more widely on the\r\nleft side. There was a slight contracture of the vesical sphincter,\r\nnecessitating the catheter. The tendon and cutaneous reflexes were lost.\r\n\r\nBy February 14, when the patient was sent to the Bellay Hospital,\r\nmuscular atrophy had made its appearance. No plasmodia could now be\r\nfound in the blood, which showed 71 per cent polynuclear leukocytes, 20\r\nper cent mononuclears, 9 per cent lymphocytes.\r\n\r\nThis state lasted til February 25. Despite the fact that the patient\r\nate well, emaciation rapidly progressed. The buttock showed a very\r\nfew signs of decubitus. Upon this date there was pain from a marked\r\norchitis of the left side, the cause for which remains unknown (no\r\nhistory of gonorrhœa; catheter used for the last time, February 15).\r\nThe temperature which attended the orchitis came down in three days;\r\nthe patient’s appetite was singularly good, but the muscular atrophy\r\nincreased. The speech defect meantime disappeared, and the patient\r\nswallowed more readily.\r\n\r\nMarch 7 a slight and hardly perceptible movement could be noted in the\r\nfingers of the left hand. Two days later, similar movements appeared in\r\nthe right. March 11 he could spread his fingers in a kind of creeping\r\nmovement. Next day slight movements were possible with the legs, and\r\nMarch 13 the knees were movable. March 14 the patient could lift his\r\nhead from the pillow. The range of movement now increased all over the\r\nbody. According to the patient, those parts were the first to regain\r\npower that had been attacked last. This certainly seemed to be the case\r\nwith respect to the left upper limb, in which first the hand and wrist,\r\nthen the elbow and shoulder, successively recovered power. The legs\r\nregained their power in the same way proximad. March 17 the patient\r\ncould sit up and grasp objects with the left hand. The cremaster and\r\nplantar reflexes appeared,--the former, more on the right; the latter,\r\nmore on the left. The left pupil remained in wider dilatation than the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe treatment was by quinin and potassium iodide, with massage. The\r\npatient was apparently on the highroad to complete recovery, and left\r\nfor France March 21, weighing 63 kilos.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrench-foot: Acroparesthesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 132.= (COTTET, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA fantassin, 36, carpenter by trade, went into the trenches October,\r\n1914, and had two attacks of trench-foot, first in January, 1915, when\r\nthere was a painful swelling of the foot and secondly in July, 1916,\r\nwhen there were some bullae on the dorsal aspect of the feet. These\r\nwere not serious and the fantassin did not report sick.\r\n\r\nHe was wounded, August 27, 1916, by shell fragment on the right elbow,\r\nwas evacuated to the ambulance where the fragment was extracted and\r\nthen to a hospital which he left cured with a seven days’ leave.\r\nAlthough he had not suffered in any way from his feet while in\r\nhospital, and had not been exposed to cold, the bullae reappeared on\r\nthe feet just as they had been in July. They in fact now formed a sort\r\nof exanthem occupying symmetrically the dorsal surfaces of the toes.\r\nThe bullae contained serum. They were confluent, varying from pin head\r\nto a nut in size, were as a rule round, but sometimes irregular. The\r\neruption went on to a cure rapidly and on the twelfth day the bullae\r\nhad dried up. This patient had hypesthesia up to the knees, hypesthesia\r\nof the dorsal surfaces of the feet, hyperesthesia of the plantar\r\nsurfaces and ankles, hypesthesia of the forearm and the elbow and of\r\nthe dorsal surfaces of the hands with possibly exaggerated sensibility\r\nof the palma surfaces. Hypesthesia of the face was limited to a small\r\npart of the right ear. The reflexes were normal and there was no\r\natrophy. The name “paresthetic trench acrotrophodynia” was given to it.\r\n\r\nIn a service of eighty beds Cottet found within two months fifteen\r\ninstances of these acroparesthetic disorders regarded as neuritic\r\nchanges in trench-foot of a latent and lasting character which would\r\nhave remained unobserved unless there were disorders of sensibility. In\r\nfact similar disorders of sensibility may be found without any history\r\nof _gelure des pieds_, forming a latent type of neuritic alteration\r\nhardly noticed by the patient himself. In twenty-six cases Cottet found\r\nsixteen with hypesthesia of the ears and of the nose.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet injury of spine; bronchopneumonia: état criblé of spinal cord.\r\n\r\n=Case 133.= (ROUSSY, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAs to the development of eschars, Roussy reports the case of a\r\nlieutenant wounded September 25, 1915. There was a penetrating wound\r\nof the interscapular region. The bullet had entered on the posterior\r\naspect of the right scapular region and had emerged at the level of the\r\nfirst dorsal vertebra. October 1, a neurological examination showed\r\nflaccid paraplegia, knee-jerks normal, Achilles jerk weak on the right,\r\nplantar reflexes flexor, cremasteric reflex absent on the right, and\r\nboth abdominal reflexes absent. There were pains in the legs and arms.\r\nThere was retention of urine with overflow. A slight dulness on the\r\nright; temperature from 38 to 39 degrees.\r\n\r\nFour weeks later the knee-jerks had become very weak, and the Achilles\r\njerks were now absent. There was an extensive diffuse atrophy of the\r\nlower leg and thigh muscles, and a hypesthesia of pronounced degree had\r\ndeveloped throughout the legs, over the buttocks, and in the lumbar\r\nregion. Anal and vesical sphincters relaxed; dejections voluminous;\r\nsacral decubitus as well as healed eschars. December 5, the patient was\r\ntransferred to the Army neurological center; temperature rose; there\r\nwas much expectoration; paracentesis yielded no fluid; pneumococcus\r\nin the sputum. Cystitis had developed despite extreme care. Extensive\r\nedema of the legs developed. There was increased dulness on the right\r\nside, coughing and dyspnea. Death, January 17.\r\n\r\nThe autopsy showed a bronchial pneumonia of the right lower lobe,\r\nconfluent, imitating a lobar pneumonia. The left lung also showed\r\nextensive confluent bronchopneumonia at the base as well as\r\ndisseminated areas and edema of the middle and apical portions.\r\nInfectious splenitis, large fatty liver, swollen kidneys, no\r\npyonephritis.\r\n\r\nThe spinous processes of the 6th and 7th cervical vertebrae were\r\ninjured. There was no obvious gross disease within the theca except\r\nthat there was a slight adhesion between the dura mater and the\r\nanterior surface of the spinal cord at the level of the 7th cervical\r\nand highest dorsal vertebrae. There was, however, a depression on\r\nthe anterior surface of the spinal cord at a lower level, namely, at\r\nthe level of the 4th dorsal vertebra. Microscopic examination showed\r\nmyelomalacia with small cavities in the 1st and 4th dorsal segments,\r\nsuggesting the _état criblé_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Roussy, these patients injured in the spinal region are\r\nparticularly sensitive to cold and support transfer badly even when the\r\ndisease is short. Such patients should be evacuated to the interior\r\nafter the shortest delay possible. Sometimes these patients show rib\r\nfractures; these are in the posterior portions of the ribs and are due\r\nto the fall of the man when struck. It might be possible even that the\r\nspinal lesions should through the action of the sympathetic nervous\r\nsystem favor lung infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion: Hystero-organic symptoms; decubitus; radicular sensory\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\n=Case 134.= (HEITZ, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 32, was bowled over in a first-line trench by the bursting\r\nof a shell that he did not see coming, September 14, 1914. He regained\r\nconsciousness only in the middle of the night, finding himself half\r\ncovered with water. He was taken up by the stretcher-bearers at\r\neleven in the morning. Paralysis in the legs was then absolute. There\r\nwere pains in the legs and in the back, but there was no evident\r\nlesion. Knee-jerks, plantar reflexes, and abdominal reflexes absent;\r\ncremasteric reflex absent on the left, weak on the right. Tactile\r\nsensations, on the contrary, were almost intact except for a slight\r\ndiminution over the feet and the external aspects of the lower legs.\r\nSensitiveness to pin-prick, however, was abolished throughout both\r\nlower extremities, and diminished in the abdomen and back up to two or\r\nthree centimeters above the level of the umbilicus; that is, including\r\nthe territory of the first lumbar and the last three dorsal roots.\r\nSensibility to heat was abolished in the feet, the external aspect\r\nof the lower legs, and the posterior aspect of the thighs, but was\r\npreserved in the second and third lumbar territory, in the anterior\r\naspect of the thighs, as well as in the region below the umbilicus.\r\nMicturition was impossible. Constipation the first few days yielded\r\nspontaneously September 20. There were signs in the bases of both\r\nlungs, corresponding with a suffocating feeling. September 22, he was\r\nevacuated, almost well, without signs of pulmonary congestion, having\r\nregained the power of urination and some capacity to move the legs\r\nsidewise. February, 1915, after evacuation to a hospital at Vic, he\r\nshowed sacral decubitus, soon reaching the size of a hand, as well as\r\ntrochanteric decubitus; traces of albumin in the urine, sacral and\r\nsciatic pains (recalcitrant to morphine).\r\n\r\nHe began to improve December 25. Camphorated oil and the sitting\r\nposture relieved the pulmonary congestion; the temperature, which had\r\noscillated round 38 degrees, fell; the decubitus scarred over; the\r\nknee-jerks reappeared to some extent, and movements began. February 5,\r\nthe patient had become able to walk without crutches. There was still a\r\ntwo-franc sized area of decubitus over the sacrum, and still a little\r\nspinal pain in walking.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to consider this case only functional in view of the\r\ndecubitus, to say nothing of the radicular distribution of the sensory\r\ndisorder. Heitz brings this and the previously given case (No. 1) into\r\nrelation with Elliot’s case of transient paraplegia (see Case 210) and\r\nRavaut (see Case 201).\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock (windage?); typhoid fever; “neuritis” actually hysterical.\r\n\r\n=Case 135.= (ROUSSY, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Colonial soldier was sent back from the front, September 12, 1914,\r\nfor nervous disorder due to the shock of the windage of a bullet.\r\nHe had not lost consciousness. Under observation at his station, he\r\ngot typhoid fever, and was cared for at Paris from the beginning of\r\nOctober. About October 15 he began to feel pains in his left shoulder,\r\nneck, and arm. The diagnosis, neuritis, was made and was strongly borne\r\nin upon the patient, so that upon the cure of his typhoid, he went out\r\non two months’ leave with a complete impotence and much pain of the\r\nleft arm. At the end of his relief, he was evacuated to Villejuif.\r\nJanuary 24, it was found that he had no somatic phenomena whatever,\r\ndespite the fact that the left arm and a part of the forearm was\r\npowerless, and so painful that the patient cried out when his arm was\r\nmoved. There were a few cracklings in the scapulo-humeral joint.\r\n\r\nHot air and reëducation cured the man in less than two months (March\r\n20), though the disorder had lasted for four months. The patient had\r\nbeen retired for hysteria before the war and had re-enlisted.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet wound of pleura: Reflex hemiplegia and double ulnar syndrome.\r\n\r\n=Case 136.= (PHOCAS AND GUTMANN, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 26, was wounded in the enfilading of an Argonne trench\r\nDecember 17, 1914. He felt the bullet like an electrical shock, and\r\nfell. He had been leaning forward at the time and suddenly felt the\r\nleft half of his body go paralyzed and his mouth pulled to one side.\r\nHe did not lose consciousness, and spat up a good deal of blood five\r\nminutes after falling. He lay in the trench all night, unable to move\r\nhis left leg except by the aid of his right. He was evacuated next\r\nday. There was a five-franc piece wound at the upper border of the\r\nleft scapula, four finger-breadths from the median line. There were a\r\nfew lung signs which rapidly cleared up. December 28, the hemiplegia\r\nwas better, although neurological examination showed weakness of left\r\nupper extremity, abolition of deep reflexes, and certain skin changes\r\nof the left hand with edema (_main succulent_), decreased resistance of\r\nmuscles of lower extremity to passive motion, especially of adductors\r\nand flexors, exaggerated polykinetic left knee-jerk, ankle clonus,\r\nBabinski reflex, abdominal and cremasteric reflexes absent on left,\r\nplatysma paralysis left, with complete paralysis in the inferior\r\ndistribution of the facialis; whistling impossible. Also the left eye\r\ncould not be closed singly. Synergic movements of the lower part of the\r\nparalyzed face when the right hand of the patient was grasped.\r\n\r\nThere were also sensorimotor disorders in the ulnar distribution on\r\nboth sides, with complete anesthesia to pin prick. There was also an\r\narea of hyperesthesia of the anterior and postero-internal aspect\r\nof the right forearm from below the elbow to the wrist. The tendon\r\nreflexes were weak but distinct on the right side. The left arm had\r\nfeelings of pain, with _élancements_ and formication from the shoulder\r\nto the fingers on the ulnar distribution. There was, of course, also,\r\nlocal hyperesthesia due to the wound of the thorax.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture showed a fluid normal in all respects. We deal with\r\na hemiplegia of organic nature, associated with the bilateral ulnar\r\nsyndrome. The hemiplegia followed the trauma immediately. When the\r\nulnar phenomena appeared is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe lung complications cleared. The pains disappeared; motion returned\r\nup to the level of the facialis. The patient got up and three months\r\nlater went on convalescence, still presenting Babinski, exaggerated\r\nknee-jerk and weak arm reflexes on the left side. The bilateral\r\nulnar syndrome had disappeared six weeks after the patient entered\r\nhospital. Phocas and Gutmann cite a considerable literature on\r\nnerve complications of pleural trauma, among them syncopes of grave\r\nprognosis; a relatively frequent pleural epilepsy (forty-five per cent\r\nfatal) or epileptic status (seventy per cent fatal); and the rare\r\nhemiplegia. Accidents and death have followed exploratory puncture of\r\nthe pleura. Air embolism is probably not the cause. Phocas and Gutmann\r\nprefer the theory of a reflex disorder starting from the pleura.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical tachypnoea.\r\n\r\n=Case 137.= (GAILLARD, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man, 23, came to the Lariboisière November 29, 1915, in a hurry\r\nto show evidence that he had been invalided for valvular lesion of\r\nthe heart. In point of fact, the interne found a murmur at the base.\r\nYet there were things in the military papers suggesting caution. The\r\npatient next morning showed no malaise, dyspnoea, or any evidence of\r\nserious disorder. The contractions of the thorax beat in time with\r\ncontractions of the alae of the nose, about 112 per minute. Here, then,\r\nwas a cardiopulmonary patient. The heart impulse was exaggerated; the\r\npatient could not or would not stop breathing to aid the auscultation,\r\nbut almost absolutely normal sounds could be heard at the apex and the\r\nbase. A valvular lesion could be excluded. The lungs were perfectly\r\nnormal. The patient was requested to stop his gymnastics, which might\r\nhave succeeded elsewhere but could not at the Lariboisière!\r\n\r\nHow could the man have established the synchronism of pulse and\r\nrespiration and synchronous tachypnoea and tachycardia? Why should he\r\npersist in this form of sport, since he had already been invalided?\r\nThe family history was not especially suggestive (father albuminuric,\r\ndied at 59; mother well, probably tuberculous). Scarlet fever at eight;\r\noccupation, tourneur. After four months of service there was gastric\r\ndisorder followed by typhoid fever (despite vaccination, according to\r\nthe patient). Convalescent leave at Paris, during which leave he had\r\nswollen legs and albuminuria. May, 1915, gastric difficulty; valvular\r\nlesion determined; examination; invalided. At home, a variety of\r\ncomplaints, for which treatment was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nDuring further examination it was noted that in auscultation the head\r\nof the examiner was lifted, as if there were hypertrophy of the heart\r\nor an aortic aneurysm. The synchronism was less exact on December 2;\r\n112 beats to 128 respiration. Was this man a simulator? Had he become\r\nthe victim of his own enterprise? There was no evidence of simulation.\r\nIt was a question of a monosymptomatic hysteria. Gaillard discontinued\r\nthe _manière forte_ and undertook a softer treatment, but the _manière\r\nforte_ had caused the family to want to take him away. Perhaps they\r\nfeared a too efficacious treatment. He then escaped observation. It is\r\nprobable that the tachypnoea ceased during sleep. It was not so marked\r\nafter the medical visit was over.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoldier’s heart.\r\n\r\n=Case 138.= (PARKINSON, July, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA corporal, 21, who had been a miner and entirely well up to enlistment\r\nin August, 1914, went to France in 1915. In June, came shortness of\r\nbreath and palpitation on exertion; later, precordial pain (fifth\r\nspace, between nipple and median line) and giddiness on walking. Like\r\nall cases of true so-called “soldier’s heart,” this soldier had no\r\nphysical signs indicative of heart disease, yet reported sick for\r\ncardiac symptoms on exertion. In this particular case, as in about half\r\nof forty cases reported by Parkinson, there had been no disability in\r\ncivil life.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1915, the soldier was admitted to the casualty clearing\r\nstation, where the apex beat was found in fifth intercostal space\r\ninternal to the left nipple line. The first sound was duplicated in all\r\nareas. The second sound was duplicated, though not loudly, at the base.\r\nAfter nine months’ treatment, this man went back to light duty with\r\nslight symptoms.\r\n\r\nAccording to Parkinson, the absence of abnormal physical signs in\r\nthe heart of a soldier should not prevent his discharge from the\r\narmy if under training or on active service he shows breathlessness\r\nand precordial pain whenever he undergoes exertion well borne by his\r\nfellows. A simple exertion test, such as climbing 25 to 50 steps,\r\nreproduces the symptoms in such a patient. The rate of the heart at\r\nrest is a little higher than that of normal men, though the increase on\r\nexertion is greater. Nevertheless, it has been proved that the increase\r\nof rate on exertion bears no relation to the symptoms elicited and is\r\ntherefore without value in judging the functional efficiency of the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoldier’s heart?\r\n\r\n=Case 139.= (PARKINSON, July, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant, 36, had been in the army from 17 to 29, but in 1908 he\r\nhad acute rheumatism and was discharged from the army. He then became\r\na furnace man and had shortness of breath and palpitation on severe\r\nexertion with syncope three times.\r\n\r\nHe re-enlisted in August, 1914, and had an attack of orthopnea and\r\nedema after exposure at a review. However, he improved and went to\r\nFrance in May, 1915, where he again had symptoms; namely, precordial\r\npain and breathlessness on severe exertion. One day while carrying\r\ntelephone wire under fire, the sergeant felt a sudden pain in the\r\nregion of the apex beat, shooting down the right arm. “I thought I\r\nwas shot.” He fell down, very short of breath. His left arm remained\r\nsore and weak. Two days later came a similar attack, this time with\r\nunconsciousness, and the left arm was now useless. Two days later he\r\nwas admitted to hospital, where slight breathlessness but no pain and\r\nno enlargement of cardiac dulness could be found. No further details\r\nare available but it seems clear that this man is unfit for duty.\r\nAccording to Parkinson, it is probable that the infection indicates the\r\npresence of some degree of myocardial disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrain and shell-shock: Acceleration of diabetes mellitus.\r\n\r\n=Case 140.= (KARPLUS, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, aged 22, previously healthy and from a healthy family,\r\nwas struck by a shell fragment in the forehead and lay for several\r\nhours unconscious. He did not vomit. He had a number of furuncles on\r\nhis body and his urine, upon examination, showed a severe diabetes\r\nmellitus which increased despite treatment. Upon an attempt to withdraw\r\ncarbohydrate, the sugar suddenly sank from six to four per cent.\r\nAcetone at the same time increased. An abrasion had been noticed by the\r\npatient a few days before the shell explosion on the spot rubbed by the\r\n_tornister_. The patient said that since his accident he had had to\r\nurinate every night several times and was often very thirsty, neither\r\nof which tendencies had he had before. A month before he became _merod_\r\nhe had had an injury of the hand produced by a shell fragment. He had\r\nundergone tremendous strain.\r\n\r\nThe chances are that the excitement and the strain had more to do with\r\nthe diabetes mellitus than the shell explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\nDercum’s disease.\r\n\r\n=Case 141.= (HOLLANDE and MARCHAND, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn adjutant in a chasseur battalion was buried by a shell explosion,\r\nwhich killed his lieutenant beside him, January 5, 1915, at\r\nHartmannsweilerkopf. Hematuria followed; ten days later, fever with\r\nanorexia, and the appearance of two or three lipomata on the anterior\r\nsurface of the thighs. Remaining at his post, the adjutant took part\r\nin an attack, March 5; was evacuated on the 8th; “lipomatosis with\r\nfebrile reactions.” He spent eight days at Bussang, and thence went to\r\nthe hospital at Pont-de-Claix. Here marked albuminuria was noted; the\r\nlipomata increased in volume; others appeared in the arms. The patient\r\nwas transferred to the Des-Genettes, where the diagnosis nephritis\r\nwas added to the previous diagnosis, and a milk diet was prescribed.\r\nConvalescence of five months was proposed. The lipomata increased in\r\nvolume and in number. The patient was then hospitalized at Avenue\r\nBerthelot, placed in the auxiliaries, and stationed eight months at his\r\ndépôt.\r\n\r\nWhen he was observed by Hollande and Marchand, four nut-sized tumors\r\nwere found on the anterior surface of the left thigh; two smaller\r\ntumors: one of them painful to pressure, lay on the inner aspect,\r\nanother the size of a small egg lay in the right thigh, and there\r\nwere two others on the internal aspect and two on the external aspect\r\nof the thigh. A nut-sized tumor was found on the inner border of the\r\nright forearm, and below it another lenticular tumor. A nut-sized\r\ntumor was found on the left forearm below the elbow on the internal\r\nborder. Small tumors were found on the buttocks. There were no tumors\r\nbelow the knees, in the upper arms, or on the thorax. There were 14\r\ntumors in all. The smaller the tumor the more sensitive, and there\r\nwas more pain when the tumor had just appeared and during the first\r\ndays of its growth. There was no spontaneous pain; pain only upon a\r\nblow or pressure. Diminished knee-jerks, especially the right; no\r\nother neurological disorder, although the patient complained of often\r\nhaving something before his eyes. There was a marked diminution in\r\nthe memory. Heart was in the 5th space on the nipple line, pulse 110;\r\nWassermann reaction negative; red blood cells, 3,520,000, white cells,\r\n6500; albuminuria, hematuria, leucocytes, and urethral cells in the\r\nurine. The temperature had now become normal. The lateral lobes of\r\nthe thyroid were slightly larger than normal, but not painful. Sella\r\nturcica was unchanged upon X-ray. Exploratory puncture of a tumor\r\nshowed much free fat, without fatty acid crystals and with some fat\r\ncells. The cells could not be cultivated in test tube. The authors\r\nbelieve it doubtful whether this instance of Dercum’s disease is\r\nrelated with the shell explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHyperthyroidism.\r\n\r\n=Case 142.= (TOMBLESON, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private, 22, was selected by Col. Garrod for hypnotic treatment by\r\nTombleson from among the hyperthyroid cases. He was admitted April 3,\r\n1916, with a typical hyperthyroidism, with manual tremor, enlarged\r\nthyroid, pulse 120, blood pressure 136-40, and hemic murmur. Tombleson\r\ninduced deep somnambulism at the first hypnotic sitting and suggested\r\nan increase of nerve strength and steadiness. The suggestions under\r\nsomnambulism were repeated for ten days. An occasional added suggestion\r\nwas given as to lessening of the thyroid. At the end of the ten days\r\nthe patient declared himself quite well.\r\n\r\nEight of twenty consecutive functional cases treated by hypnotism by\r\nTombleson were cases of hyperthyroidism and in virtually all of these\r\nan effect like the above was registered.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; thrown against wall, stunned, emotional: Paroxysmal heart\r\ncrises six days later, observed for two months. Neurasthenia? Mild\r\nGraves’ disease?\r\n\r\n=Case 143.= (DEJERINE AND GASCUEL, December, 1914.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 29, was sent to auxiliary hospital No. 274, for heart\r\ntrouble, a little thin but looking vigorous enough (typhoid fever at\r\n13 and some diseases of unknown nature and of brief duration while in\r\nmilitary service).\r\n\r\nSeptember 24, a large calibre German shell burst and threw him against\r\na wall, producing no wound or contusion. He was momentarily stunned,\r\nemotionally much affected, and noted at the time extreme palpitation.\r\nHe was evacuated to Paris September 30, six days after the shock. His\r\npulse was 130-134, regular, and the heart seemed not to be anomalous in\r\nany respect.\r\n\r\nBut there were paroxysmal crises in which the pulse rose to 180 and\r\nin which the patient fell into a state of great anxiety. The mouth\r\ntemperature in the midst of such crises would always rise to 38°,\r\nand this temperature would outlast the rest of the seizure. The man\r\nwas mentally depressed and apparently indifferent, preoccupied with\r\nhis heart and his insomnia, but at the same time emotionally easily\r\naffected. In short, he was a neurasthenic. There was no change in\r\nmental state, tachycardia, or paroxysmal seizures in two months, except\r\nthat he gained weight. Walking and climbing stairs produced dyspnoea.\r\nUrine was negative. According to Dejerine, such a case should be\r\ntreated by psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nAlquier, in discussion, called attention to the slight but distinct\r\ntremor in this case, dermographia, and spells of perspiration. He\r\nsuggested that the case might be one of mild Graves’ disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nHyperthyroidism three months, following ten months’ service, at times\r\nunder protracted shell fire.\r\n\r\n=Case 144.= (ROTHACKER, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man in service ten months, under strong excitement and at times under\r\nprotracted shell fire, complained of palpitation, insomnia, dizziness,\r\nand dyspnoea. Hospital notes showed that the left lobe of the thyroid\r\nwas somewhat enlarged. Before the war his neck could not have been\r\nvery thick; he had served his year out without difficulty. His mother\r\nis said to have suffered at one time from thick neck. According to the\r\npatient, he had never suffered with heart trouble. Heart not enlarged;\r\nblowing first sound over the apex. Graefe, Stellwag and Möbius signs\r\nnegative. Heart rapid, not irregular; pulse strong. There was fine\r\ntremor of the hands, as well as a tremor of the tongue. Knee-jerks\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe patient was at first sleepless and excited, but after three weeks\r\nin bed the heart murmur had disappeared. After three months, he was\r\nordered to _Ersatz_ with the left side of the neck measuring 20 as\r\nagainst 18 cm. on the right. There was a soft pulsating swelling of the\r\nthyroid. First sound over apex still impure; heart action now regular;\r\npulse 64; blood pressure 120 Riva-Rocci; after test exercises, slight\r\ndyspnoea. No cyanosis. The outstretched hands were no longer very\r\ntremulous. The knee-jerks were still increased. The man had begun to\r\nsleep well. His neck was apparently much diminished in girth.\r\n\r\nHere then was a case of Graves’ disease of acute development, brought\r\nout by nervous stress and excitement as well as by 10 months of war\r\nwork and exposure to shell fire,--with approximate recovery after three\r\nmonths of rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nGraves’ disease, forme fruste.\r\n\r\n=Case 145.= (BABONNEIX AND CÉLOS, June, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA farmer, 31, entered the Rosendael Hospital, Jan. 25, 1917. He had\r\nbeen two years in active service. The family history was negative\r\nexcept that one of his sisters had had dyspepsia. The patient denied\r\nvenereal disease and alcoholism and had always been well. At the Battle\r\nof the Marne he was slightly wounded in the left knee. January, 1915,\r\nhe was exposed to gas bombs and explosive shells. He was several days\r\nin the hospital spitting, or perhaps vomiting blood and was sent on a\r\nlong convalescence. On returning to the front, he had to be sent back\r\nto hospital with a note, “not fit for service, nervous troubles and\r\nparoxysmal tachycardia.” In point of view he now showed a number of\r\nsymptoms suggestive of Graves’ disease, such as a definite exophthalmia\r\nwhich, according to the patient, started up a short time after the\r\nshock and a tachycardia (110-120) with circulatory excitement, a\r\ntumultuous heart, neck arteries contracting, almost dancing in their\r\ncontractions, together with a systolic murmur maximal in the pulmonary\r\narea, not retaining, variable,--in short, suggestive of an inorganic\r\nmurmur. There was also a generalized rapid tremor and a variety of\r\nvasomotor disorders, such as blushing and paling, perspiration,\r\nexaggerated reflexes, emotionality, logorrhea, jactitation. There were\r\nalso digestive troubles, regurgitation after meals and the patient had\r\nbecome thin and weak.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, no swelling of the thyroid gland nor any eye signs\r\nother than the exophthalmia. In short this case is doubtless one of\r\nthe _forme fruste_ of Graves’ disease. It seems to show that Graves’\r\ndisease may have a traumatic origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nSomatic complication in a shell-shock hysteria (Trauma).\r\n\r\n=Case 146.= (OPPENHEIM, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nMusketeer. No faulty heredity, but was always somewhat nervous. On\r\nOctober 26, a shell burst one meter in front of him, burying him under\r\nthe anterior wall of the trench. He was dug out and taken to the field\r\nhospital, where he remained unconscious until the next morning. On\r\nOctober 29, he was taken to the reserve hospital. Severe pain in the\r\nhead, entire scalp tender on pressure, especially in the left frontal\r\nregion, left side upper lip swollen, bluish and discolored. Left tenth\r\nand sixth ribs broken. Fracture of skull(?). November 10, at eight\r\no’clock at night, sudden attack of vomiting, and the patient was found\r\nin a faint in the water closet. Almost complete paralysis of speech\r\nand all of the four extremities. Consciousness obscured; no sensory\r\ndisturbances. November 11, severe headache and vertigo. Speech somewhat\r\nmore intelligible. Pulse, 60 to 68. “Evidently secondary hemorrhage in\r\nthe brain.” November 12, to Augusta Hospital. November 20, admission\r\nto nerve hospital. Typical aphonia. Limitation of motion in all four\r\nextremities, but no paralysis--anergy. Reflexes normal. Unable to\r\nstand and walk. Sensibility preserved. Under suggestive treatment,\r\ncurative gymnastics, as well as electrotherapeutics, the aphonia\r\nand abasia disappeared in a few days, but the patient continued to\r\ncomplain of headache and insomnia. December 16, an attack of nausea,\r\nheadache, vomiting, loss of consciousness, followed by epistaxis,\r\nmarked tachycardia. January 4, in his sleep he felt a prick in his left\r\nupper arm, as if he had pushed a sewing needle into the arm. X-ray\r\nexamination showed a needle in the arm. This was extracted under local\r\nanesthesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.[5] SCHIZOPHRENOSES\r\n\r\n(DEMENTIA PRAECOX GROUP)\r\n\r\n    [5] VII. Geriopsychoses (senile-senescent group) not\r\n    represented in war cases (see page).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sister’s ear boxed for blow to a German soldier’s pride: Diagnosis\r\nPSYCHOPATHIC CONSTITUTION! A true psychosis develops: hate of Prussia\r\nand the Junkertum: Diagnosis, DEMENTIA PRAECOX!!\r\n\r\n=Case 147.= (BONHOEFFER.)\r\n\r\nA sick soldier in a military hospital kept complaining of being waked\r\nup too early, and of poor food. His reactions looked like the irritable\r\nweakness of a psychopath. One day he went into a room where a woman\r\nwas being examined, without knocking. When ordered out, he boxed the\r\nSister’s ear.\r\n\r\nHe said himself, on transfer to the psychiatric clinic, that he had\r\nalways been quarrelsome as a child with his brothers and sisters,\r\nsubject to fainting spells, and poor and stubborn in military\r\nservice,--all of which seemed to clinch the diagnosis of psychopathic\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nBut he seemed to show a decided lack of autocritique. About boxing\r\nthe Sister’s ear on her saying “Please go out,”--his idea was that he\r\ncould not let a thing like that happen to him,--a German soldier and\r\na patient! Moreover, “It should not be thought that perhaps I had a\r\nlove affair with her! There was a cynicism about her.” The Sister had\r\na strong sex impulse, he could see that by her nose: she was, so to\r\nspeak, “hypochondriacal.” Both in speech and writing he used stilted\r\nphrases. The ego at last swelled to the point of his saying that he was\r\nan inhabitant of the World and hated Prussia and Prussian _Junkertum_.\r\n\r\nThen came unmotivated states of excitement, with pressure of speech\r\nand motion, and eventually negativism. Accordingly, the diagnosis\r\nhebephrenia finally replaced that of psychopathic constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nDementia praecox, arrested as spy.\r\n\r\n=Case 148.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA German private, called to the colors, was supposed to take his\r\ncivilian clothes to the post office along with his comrades on March\r\n21, 1915. He did not get his package ready in time and was ordered to\r\ngo with another troop. At an opportune moment, he left the barracks\r\nwith the package of clothing. When later arrested, he said that he had\r\ngone by railroad to Dirschau; then he had visited Berlin. After this,\r\nhe had walked to Bromberg, Schneidemühl, and Landsberg.\r\n\r\nAt last he had ridden back to Küstrin. At Küstrin some children told\r\na railway official that the man was making drawings. There was a\r\npetroleum tank near by. Accordingly, he was arrested as a possible spy.\r\nHe claimed that he was not a soldier.\r\n\r\nIn the clinic, he looked dull and smiled a good deal. It seems that,\r\nbefore being called to the colors, he had been very angry with his\r\nwife and had even threatened her. He now explained this anger as his\r\nwife’s fault. She had attacked him, he said. He said that he sometimes\r\nhad attacks of weakness, which used to last two days at a time, but\r\nthey had recently lasted for a shorter time. He said that his thoughts\r\nalways wanted to be somewhere else. In fact, he had not performed\r\nmilitary duty. His uniform had been gotten for him, but he had had no\r\nfurther orders. Sometimes in a fever or dream his head seemed to be as\r\nbig as a room, as if there were no space for it. There was an itching\r\nin his legs, he said, which often fell asleep so he could not stand on\r\nthem. He had had syphilis seven years before, after which he had been\r\nhoarse, forgetful, and anxious.\r\n\r\nExamination showed perceptive power and knowledge to be good. He played\r\nthe violin, but always the same tunes. He said that he had not worked\r\nin Berlin during the winter of 1914. He spoke as if he had been in\r\nanother sanitarium, where he did nothing but dream by himself, taking\r\nno interest in things, and lying indifferently, with a blanket over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe said that when he received the uniform he had a longing for clean\r\nunderclothes. Requested to explain the meaning of the uniform, he\r\nremarked: “Why, many have these things on.”\r\n\r\n_Re_ dementia praecox, Lépine states that in the French army instances\r\nof dementia praecox have been numerous in the interior, both at the\r\ntime of mobilization and at the time of calling out sundry new classes.\r\nHe notes that the courtmartial and invaliding experts have neither the\r\nleisure nor the experience necessary to keep these men from going into\r\nthe army. The somewhat frequent remissions in dementia praecox make the\r\ntask all the more difficult. To be sure, the stuporous and catatonic\r\ncases are not very much in evidence in the army; when such cases do\r\noccur, it is easy enough to evacuate the patients to a hospital for\r\nobservation. Far more troublesome are cases of a less advanced or\r\nmilder nature. Here are cases in which judgment is deficient, and in\r\nwhich quite unsystematic, incoherent, and transient delusional ideas\r\noccur. The patient looks quite normal to the non-psychiatric expert.\r\nSomething odd happens which quite suddenly reveals the delusional\r\nideas. For example, there is a fugue, or else the soldier goes to his\r\nsuperior and aggressively chides him for having troubled him the night\r\nbefore. These particular psychopaths are among the most dangerous to be\r\nfound in the army.\r\n\r\n\r\nFugue, catatonic.\r\n\r\n=Case 149.= (BOUCHEROT, 1915-6.)\r\n\r\nA gunner, aged 23, enlisted on the expiration of his regular period of\r\nservice and was a good soldier, in excellent health, up to June, 1915.\r\nHe then began to have a few vague ideas of persecution. In a short\r\ntime these became more definite and he caused talk by requesting to\r\ngo into another corps because his comrades did not like him. He told\r\nhis brigadier that the soldiers were frightening him by magnetism. He\r\nhad hallucinations of hearing people say, “He will get it.” He kept by\r\nhimself, would not eat and stood motionless for long periods of time\r\nbefore his mess-tin. He was often found in a dreamy state of apathy.\r\nOne day he left the cantonment without leave, wandered through fields,\r\nhad coffee in a village and then started off in no special direction.\r\nThe police took him without resistance the next day. He said, “My\r\ncomrades are in politics; they are going to cheat me.” He was brought\r\nto Fismes and the ambulance surgeon said that he found he did not know\r\nwhat he was about. He was amnestic for the fugue, explaining that he\r\nwent because he was frightened. It was hard to get him to eat.\r\n\r\nJuly 14, he was evacuated to Fleury protesting arrogantly, but this\r\nphase of excitement passed and he became absolutely indifferent and\r\ndisoriented. He became untidy in his person and in no way could his\r\nattention be attracted whether by mentioning his family or the war. He\r\nsometimes made ape-like grimaces and sometimes laughed causelessly. He\r\nwas occasionally negativistic, but in general was perfectly compliant\r\nwith the requirements of the hospital. Now and then he started off\r\nimpulsively to escape but was brought back quite indifferent. Now\r\nand then he went into bizarre contortions on a medical visit or\r\naped gestures of bystanders. He began then to go into stereotypical\r\nattitudes. This case is the only catatonic one found by Boucherot in\r\nhis war group.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesertion: Schizophrenic-looking behavior. Adjudged responsible.\r\n\r\n=Case 150.= (CONSIGLIO, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian private in the artillery, a telephone operator at the front,\r\ncame up for desertion in the face of the enemy. It seems that he had\r\noften left his post, going off for a number of hours and drinking.\r\nAt last he lost his position in the battery, went off and got drunk\r\nagain, and was removed to a hospital and held as a neurasthenic and\r\npsychopathic patient. At the territorial hospital he was regarded as\r\na melancholic. He still showed signs of alcoholism, was hallucinated,\r\ndid a number of peculiar things, was impatient of medical examination,\r\nand was given a furlough of two months for convalescence. He apparently\r\ngrew somewhat better in his father’s home, but went to a physician\r\nthere and presented his certificate as a mental case. His behavior was\r\nso peculiar on subsequent arrest that he was sent for observation to\r\nConsiglio.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that he had been in military service from August, 1912, and\r\nhad been imprisoned for a space of eight weeks for disobedience when\r\nhe had been in military service for six months. He had been punished\r\nin the army nine times, once being given 70 days for lying. He was\r\nregarded as an undisciplined soldier but not as a nervous or mental\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAt hospital he was in a semi-stupor, claimed that he was forgetful,\r\nwas apathetic concerning home and relatives, complained of pain in\r\nthe head, and altogether preserved a strange and stolid attitude with\r\noccasional gestures, mimicry, and stereotyped reactions. As he had come\r\nto be operated upon, he looked about for the cannon that was to be used\r\nin the operation. Accordingly the question of dementia praecox might\r\nwell be raised.\r\n\r\nHis indifference turned out actually to be assumed and pretentious. He\r\npreserved throughout an arrogant tone, and there were features in his\r\nvoice that strongly suggested simulation.\r\n\r\nAccording to Consiglio, we are dealing with an epileptic degenerate,\r\naddicted to alcohol, lying, and immorality. The question concerning\r\nresponsibility was settled in the affirmative. Of course, it might be\r\nthought that the case was one of pathological intoxication, in which\r\ncase, the man might be regarded as only semi-responsible. However,\r\nthe phenomena of simulation, not merely in the observation hospital\r\nbut also in the period of apparent depression and strange conduct\r\nimmediately following his arrest for desertion, led to the decision\r\nthat the man, despite his nervous abnormality, was responsible for his\r\nact. He was condemned to 20 years in prison.\r\n\r\n_Re_ dementia praecox, Buscaino and Coppola found a number of cases\r\nof dementia praecox amongst soldiers admitted to hospital during the\r\nperiod of mobilization; cases amongst men who had not yet been at the\r\nfront. These mobilization cases, in fact, were as a rule either cases\r\nof dementia praecox, cases of a psychopathic constitution, or cases of\r\nalcoholism.\r\n\r\n\r\nA disciplinary case: Schizophrenia, alcoholism.\r\n\r\n=Case 151.= (KASTAN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nIn October, 1914, a German soldier returned to his barracks late from\r\na drinking bout. He insolently called for order, brandishing his\r\narms, and when the captain rebuked him, he kept a cigar in his mouth.\r\nExamined in hospital (Allenberg), he was very reticent at first but\r\nwrote his name up over the bed with the additional word “_Dead_.” He\r\nanswered, “I don’t know” to most questions. Although it was December,\r\nhe said the season was summer. He was to be shot for disrespect, he\r\nsaid, but showed more disrespect at every remonstrance. “What is your\r\nregiment?” “I am no soldier at all, you know. I have already been\r\ndischarged as unfit for service.” “Have you been in prison?” “I don’t\r\nknow. My father often thrashed me.” Then suddenly, after a moment, “I\r\nwas in prison five, seven, and two years, and my father was in prison\r\nfour, six, and three years.” He said that he had drunk ether and urged\r\nthe physician to try it, as one saw all sorts of beautiful pictures and\r\nfigures and heard music.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, it was found that the man had been in a provincial\r\nsanatorium for some form of degenerative mental disease with\r\nexcitement. He, at this time, had given a number of fantastic stories\r\nconcerning his wanderings. For example, he said he had come from\r\nAustralia, where he had eaten snipes and crows; that he was on his way\r\nhome and would get there in half an hour (real distance 10 hours). Or\r\nagain, he would roll his eyes, assume a false name and say that he\r\nhad come from Morocco, or that he was the emperor and would not play\r\nsoldier. When asked to repeat digits, he habitually omitted the last\r\ndigit. He had been a poor scholar, and of a tricky and treacherous\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nDespite this history, he had behaved well in the army at first, though\r\ninsolent to superiors. On July 5 he had a heavy drinking bout, and\r\nwrote next day to his mother that he was going to commit suicide.\r\nAt this time he had been put for safe keeping in a cell, where he\r\nsaw foxes making as if to bite him. He also said that he was a rich\r\nnobleman, a cavalry captain with a servant (asked to be given his\r\npressed clothes and his cigarettes), and was being pursued. He rode\r\nhis pillow as if it were his horse, and hid it in the horse’s stable,\r\nnamely, the bed. He ate nothing, as he thought everything was poisoned;\r\nsmeared himself with faeces and drank urine as “strawberry punch.”\r\n\r\nWe are evidently here dealing with a psychopath of schizophrenic\r\ntendencies, strongly colored, however, by alcoholism. The patient’s\r\nfather was a drunkard, and a brother and sister were insane.\r\n\r\n_Re_ schizophrenia in the German army, Saenger remarks that like\r\nparesis, so also latent dementia praecox becomes acute under war\r\nconditions. E. Meyer states that amongst 1126 officers admitted to his\r\nhospital, August 1, 1915, there were 352 that had either psychoses or\r\nneuroses, amongst which were 148 psychogenic cases (either psychopathic\r\nor hysterical), 128 with what he terms a congenital psychopathic\r\ndiathesis, and 76 with traumatic neuroses. The cases of congenital\r\ndiathesis were somewhat difficult to diagnose, since but 44 of these\r\nwere clearly psychopathic and in the remainder the question of dementia\r\npraecox or of cyclothymic conditions arose.\r\n\r\nStier gives statistics for 1905 and 1906 in the German army, namely 35\r\nper cent of dementia praecox cases. Under war conditions the army has\r\ndeveloped far fewer cases: Bonhoeffer, 7 per cent; Meyer, 7.5 per cent;\r\nHahn, 13 per cent. But although dementia praecox figures so much less\r\nfrequently in the mobilized army than in the army of peace times (manic\r\ndepressive psychosis is also less in evidence under war conditions),\r\nthe psychopathic constitutions, hysterias, traumatic neuroses, and\r\nthe like, run from 17.5 per cent (Stier, 1905-1906) to 54 per cent\r\n(Bonhoeffer), 37.5 (Meyer), 43 per cent (Hahn).\r\n\r\n\r\nSchizophrenic symptoms. Aggravation by service.\r\n\r\n=Case 152.= (DE LA MOTTE, August, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Landsturm recruit, 20, and somewhat peculiar in early life, got\r\nwhipped by his comrades for getting back too late from leave. The next\r\nday he was commanded to carry a machine gun. He threw the gun down and\r\nmade for the barracks. He was put under psychiatric observation, as\r\nhe said he did not know what he was doing. His conduct seemed normal\r\nat first and he explained that he had heard noises and singing in his\r\nhead,--pointing to the left ear where there was an otitis media. His\r\nskill, knowledge, and general experience seemed well in hand. However,\r\nhe was not very communicative. Eventually a series of schizophrenic\r\nsymptoms came to light. He had been hearing threatening voices of\r\nvarying intensity for two years, sometimes a veil seemed to be before\r\nhis eyes, sometimes he heard his thoughts, and felt that his whole\r\npersonality was changing. He began to think that his facial traits were\r\ngradually turning into those of the physician. The hallucinations were\r\nso insistent that sometimes he did not know what he should do. He was\r\nevidently unfit for military service, and the decision was also made\r\nthat the mental disease had been aggravated by service.\r\n\r\n_Re_ schizophrenia in the service, most authors point out that there\r\nwas either patent or latent schizophrenia before mobilization. E. Meyer\r\nattempted to make a study of the influence of the war on psychopaths.\r\nHe found that the ego of the psychopath remained relatively unaffected\r\nby the war. Naturally, the paretics and the seniles were unaffected.\r\nThe grandiosity and self-centredness of the alcoholics remained as\r\nprominent as ever. Seventeen schizophrenic cases were studied, and some\r\nof these yielded entire apathy with respect to the war; others had the\r\ncontent of their delusions somewhat affected. Saaler remarks on the\r\nmilitary tinge which dementia praecox assumes under war conditions.\r\nDementia praecox and manic-depressive psychosis alike show war changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nShot himself in hand. Delusions.\r\n\r\n=Case 153.= (ROUGE, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 26, left for the front August, 1914, was slightly\r\nwounded, recovered, went back to the front, and then is said, in March,\r\n1915, to have shot himself in the hand. When up for military review a\r\ndelusional state set in. It seems that he had been interned in several\r\nhospitals for examination, but escaped four or five times because\r\nphysicians wanted to poison him and had partially succeeded.\r\n\r\nHe came to the Lemioux Custodial Institution, July 12, 1915. His\r\nbrother, 15, was a _voyou_; his sister, 16, was an imbecile. The\r\npatient told about his military history and how he had shot himself in\r\nthe left hand, to be with a certain woman, how attempts had been made\r\nto poison him, especially a certain man in Bordeaux, who wanted to\r\npossess the woman in the case. In point of fact, the physicians could\r\nnot save him from this enemy.\r\n\r\nThe patient now became calm and indifferent, lived secluded and almost\r\nimmobile. In November, however, he began to sit down and eat like\r\nothers, making low, timorous answers, vague and confused. He smiled\r\ncheerfully on questioning, but had many sad ideas. He would smilingly\r\nsay that he was going to die soon.\r\n\r\n_Re_ schizophrenia in the French army, Boucherot found eight cases\r\namongst 107 soldiers admitted to Loiret in the first year of the war.\r\nHe remarks upon the fact that the schizophrenic cases were often\r\ndisciplinary. The group is a disciplinary group. Damaye remarks upon\r\nthe difficulty of diagnosis betwixt feeblemindedness and dementia\r\npraecox as observed in the French army.\r\n\r\n\r\nVolunteer: Dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n=Case 154.= (HAURY, 1915.)\r\n\r\nN. enlisted voluntarily for three years in the Infantry, September\r\n10, 1912, and immediately gave indications of abnormal mentality by\r\nhis conduct. He made mistakes all day long. At reveille he had to be\r\ncalled several times, and when his corporal objected, he said, “It is\r\ncold; I don’t see why I must get up; I am free to remain in bed until 8\r\no’clock.” In reply to his corporal’s remonstrance about his continued\r\nlatenesses, he once said, “I can’t get ready; I have no mirror to\r\nwash before.” This was rather surprising conduct from an intelligent\r\nprinter-engraver, who had lived and gone to school in the town of\r\nLyons. He was unable to make his own bed or to perform the simplest of\r\nexercises in the manual of arms. He was violent on several occasions,\r\nonce attacking a comrade who had given him an order, and again when\r\nanother had taken his place in the line. His reasoning faculties were\r\nthose of a young child. He continued doing these strange things, and\r\nwas finally discharged.\r\n\r\n_Re_ dementia praecox amongst American troops, Edgar King, before the\r\nwar, concluded that some 5 to 8 per cent of the American cases of\r\nmental disease in the army belonged to the paranoid form of dementia\r\npraecox. King lays special emphasis upon dementia praecox, finding\r\nthat more than one-half of the army admissions for mental disease\r\nbelong to this group. He calls attention to the number of desertions\r\nand undesirables in the group. He found that 70 per cent of the cases\r\nshowed some heredity.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysteria versus catatonia.\r\n\r\n=Case 155.= (BONHOEFFER, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA reservist, 31, was in the hospital about Christmas, 1914, for\r\nrheumatism, when suddenly he became excited and was sent to the Charité\r\nPsychiatric Clinic. He was restless all night, moving about in bed,\r\ngrinding his teeth, and continually getting up. He had a blank and\r\nastonished expression; his breathing was rapid and forced. There were\r\nno pyramidal tract symptoms, but muscular power was diminished,--more\r\non the right than on the left. While the knee-jerks were being tested,\r\nthe legs moved (seemingly psychogenic). Irregular hypalgetic zones\r\nwere found, and pain was less well felt on the right side than on the\r\nleft. Answers to questions on mental examination were made with the\r\nappearance of effort, the patient breathing deeply and rapidly, head\r\ndrooping, forehead wrinkling, and eyes glancing about in an astonished\r\nway. “How many legs has a horse?” After long cogitation, the man\r\ncounted slowly,--1, 2, 3, 4. “What’s your wife’s name?” “Marie--Marie,\r\nI think.”\r\n\r\nIn the interpretation of this case, the functional paresis and\r\nhypalgesia of the right side, the functional pseudoclonus obtained\r\nduring the knee-jerk test, the mental situation,--rather suggestive\r\nof a hysterical pseudodementia or a “Ganser” dazed state,--make the\r\nprobable diagnosis at first sight psychogenic. Left to himself,\r\nhowever, the patient assumed a stereotyped unchanging posture; he would\r\nsuddenly cry out, without particular emotion, that he was to be shot\r\nor executed; there was a tendency to rhythmic repetition of certain\r\nanswers to questions, with the suggestion of perseveration.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, pronounced rhythmic, and then stereotyped, movements\r\nstarted in. Suddenly negativistic phenomena, with refusal of food and\r\nself-accusatory ideas set in; speech stopped altogether. Information\r\nfrom his relatives showed that he had been peculiar for some time and\r\nhad for years occasionally said that he was going to be shot.\r\n\r\nHere then, instead of a hysterical pseudodementia, was a case\r\nof hebephrenia or perhaps catatonia. Possibly there had been no\r\npseudodementia, but actually an elementary disorder in the associative\r\nprocess. Possibly the defects which the patient early showed, in his\r\nresponses, for example, were really genuine schizophrenic blocking.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lewandowsky, almost all cases of neurasthenia, of\r\nhysteria, and of the so-called traumatic neuroses, stand out very\r\nclearly as functional. Bonhoeffer is far less certain that the\r\ndiagnosis can be made readily in all cases. Antebellum conditions have\r\nnot been continued in wartime; hysteria was a female affair antebellum,\r\nbut under war conditions, it is found necessary to draw many\r\ndifferential diagnoses in the male betwixt schizophrenics, epileptics,\r\nand psychotics, on the one hand, and hysterics on the other.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the so-called Ganser symptom, Hesnard has dealt especially with\r\nthe value of what he calls the symptom of “absurd answers,” finding\r\nthe differential diagnosis between dementia praecox and simulation\r\nparticularly difficult. Hesnard states that incoherence is very hard to\r\nsimulate. The answers of the Ganser patient are not always incorrect,\r\nand not always absurd. The patient strikes one as intact except for the\r\nabsurd answers; intimidation and other external conditions affect the\r\nsymptom greatly. Drugs are refused by the Ganser patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hysteria”--actually dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n=Case 156.= (HOVEN, HENRI, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA shell burst about twenty-five meters away from a soldier, 21, but he\r\ncontinued in the military service thereafter for one month, having only\r\none symptom, a trembling of the arm. This persisting, he was evacuated\r\nto Calais, then to Dury to the hospital for the insane where he stayed\r\nsix months. He was transferred from Dury to the Belgian Hospital for\r\nthe Insane at Chateaugiron on August 20, 1915. He remembered nothing\r\nof his stay at Dury, Calais, or of anything that happened after the\r\nshell-shock. He had no complaint and wanted to go back to the front.\r\nHe was well oriented for time and space and had no disorders of\r\nassociation or perception. Besides the persistent, retrograde amnesia,\r\nhe showed certain neurological disorders, occasional slight vertigo,\r\na generalized tremor especially affecting the arms but disappearing\r\nalmost completely at rest, lively tendon reflexes, intense dermographia\r\nand cardiac erethism. Diagnosis was made of acute, convulsional\r\npsychosis with agitation, convalescent phase.\r\n\r\nDuring March he was quiet and worked about the hospital. In April\r\nthe patient had a number of seizures of an hysterical nature. In\r\nJune it was possible to evacuate him to full convalescence. He went\r\nback to the front and stayed there, but shortly developed catatonic\r\nsigns with visual hallucinations and delusions of persecution of a\r\nnon-systematized nature, such as poisoning, being magnetized, etc.\r\nHe was at this time poorly oriented for time, assumed bizarre and\r\ntheatrical attitudes, showed Ganser’s symptom, was oversuggestible and\r\nagitated and sleepless. Diagnosis of dementia praecox was now clear.\r\n\r\nHoven remarks that this case is important in that it suggests that a\r\ndiagnosis of hysteria may easily be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluence of war experience on the content of hallucinations and\r\ndelusions.\r\n\r\n=Case 157.= (GERVER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nIn one of the divisional field hospitals Gerver examined a patient\r\nwith a very vivid paranoic condition. The following were some of his\r\nhallucinations and delusions:\r\n\r\nThe patient asserted that everyone considered him a spy. Voices\r\ncontinually told him: “You are a spy.” “What? Spy? Caught? What?” “You\r\nwill be shot by the Germans for espionage.” About three months before\r\nhis present trouble, the patient had been wounded in left shoulder by a\r\nfragment of a large projectile. The wound healed and examination showed\r\na big scar with attachments to the bone. The patient asserted that now\r\nhe could not touch anything with his left hand, as there immediately go\r\nfrom it “some currents” to the Germans in the trenches and they at once\r\nbegin shooting at the Russian position. Later, the patient could not\r\neven look in the direction of the German front, for all he had to do\r\nwas to throw a glance in that direction and the Germans would at once\r\nbegin a bombardment.\r\n\r\nAll these phenomena he explained as being due to the fact that the\r\nfragments of the large projectile which entered his shoulder were\r\npoisoned and charmed. Through these fragments there went currents from\r\nhis hands to the Germans. The patient always supported his left hand\r\nwith his right, in order not to touch anything with it. He slept only\r\non his right side, so as not to touch the bed or floor with his left\r\nhand. During the examination and conversation the patient tried always\r\nto look downwards, so as not to throw a chance look in the direction of\r\nthe German front and call out their fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Iron Cross winner had a hysterical-looking attack (reminiscence of\r\na bayoneted Gurkha). Later he begins to talk of “this damned war that\r\nis so vulgar” and of “atrocities, concrete and abstract”: Shortly the\r\ndiagnosis, hebephrenia, had to be made.\r\n\r\n=Case 158.= (BONHOEFFER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn Iron Cross winner, 21, in the field from August, 1914, to the middle\r\nof March, 1915, at first in France, later in Russia, finally went to\r\nhospital for rheumatism and sciatica. Three months later he had to be\r\ntransferred to the Charité in a state of delirious excitement.\r\n\r\nThe attack began suddenly. He thought he was in the field telephoning\r\nwith his captain, trembled, threatened to injure people about him,\r\nsaid he could not hold the position with the few men he had, and\r\nthe like. Next day he quieted down and became oriented for time and\r\nplace. He explained that he had seen a Gurkha coming upon him with a\r\nmallet, by way of revenge upon him because he had stuck his bayonet in\r\nthe Gurkha’s breast. Behind a little hill he had seen Frenchmen and\r\nEnglishmen, from which he drew the conclusion there was going to be an\r\nattack that night. A little cloud of dust he thought was enemy cavalry.\r\nIn point of fact, he said he had once on patrol stuck a Gurkha through\r\nand the Gurkha’s eyes had since followed him in his mind. He had seen\r\nhim crawling along the ground one evening and heard his step. The\r\npatient had imperfect insight into these hallucinations when questioned\r\nabout them during the daytime, and still talked somewhat as if the\r\nexperience was a real one.\r\n\r\nAt first the situation seemed probably one of hysterical delusion,\r\nfor which the Gurkha experience served as material. In point of fact,\r\nfurther observation in the clinic showed that the diagnosis of hysteria\r\nwas wrong. He was induced to write out his experience in a style\r\nquite like his conversation; and there was a queer tendency in his\r\nwriting to the use of foreign words, somewhat improperly used. After\r\na time he began to sit about dully and at times to run about and throw\r\nhimself into and out of bed, or strike rhythmically with his shoes on\r\nthe floor, or draw his shoulders together, making grimaces, rolling\r\nhis eyes and breathing deeply. He said he had to make these movements\r\ninvoluntarily if he were in some way excited. But the peculiar conduct\r\nalso often occurred without any emotional prod. His emotions were\r\nvariable, but on the whole indifferent and not always quite suitable.\r\n\r\nHe frequently said he wanted to get into the field again, giving vent\r\nto superficial phrases, such as “atrocities, concrete and abstract,”\r\nand “this damned war that is so vulgar.” Yet a few minutes later he\r\nwould say he wanted to go to war at Amsterdam as Amsterdam had pleased\r\nhim very much. He said he now had a good many thoughts and ideas which\r\nformerly he had not had. He had not been promoted, he said, because he\r\nhad once angered an officer in another company.\r\n\r\nHis field hospital history told of certain oddities, such as his lying\r\nstiffly in bed heedless of what was going on about him, falling into\r\ncauseless depression, failing to sleep, and wandering about.\r\n\r\nAs to previous life, only his own data were available. He had been a\r\nmoderate scholar, had been rather irritable and thought a peculiar\r\ncharacter. In the ward, he showed baseless antipathy to certain\r\npatients and said they were well. He seemed to have no insight into his\r\ncondition, yet wrote in a letter that the insane state in which he was\r\nhad very much “augmented his mental organism.” The diagnosis of early\r\nhebephrenic disorder could now be considered established.\r\n\r\n\r\nOccipital trauma. Mystical visual hallucinations and explanatory\r\ndelusions.\r\n\r\n=Case 159.= (CLAUDE, LHERMITTE, VIGOUROUX, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 33, single, was wounded in the right occipital region by a\r\nshell burst September 25, 1915. There was no sign of focal lesion, but\r\na trephining operation was done, which healed perfectly. No disturbance\r\nof vision ensued. The soldier was sent to convalesce two months after\r\nhaving been examined by P. Marie at the Salpêtrière. He went back to\r\nhis regimental station and was put into the auxiliary service April 26,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of September, that is to say, a year after his\r\ninjury, he had a vision. Above the church cross at Chantenay, where he\r\nthen was, he saw a rainbow-colored bird, passing slowly in the sky. He\r\nlowered his eyes and the apparition followed and was projected on the\r\nwhite walls around him. After some time it disappeared. The soldier\r\nhimself wondered whether his brain injury might not have something to\r\ndo with the vision, but none of his comrades wounded in the head had\r\nhad any such vision. So then he thought of tobacco, of which he was a\r\nmoderate user, and stopped smoking, but the vision returned in the same\r\nintensity four months later. On examining the bird’s face carefully, he\r\nfound that it was the Holy Virgin’s. In dreams he also had analogous\r\nvisions and in the dreams the Holy Virgin spoke to him, but what she\r\nsaid he did not remember. The bird’s head did not speak to him. The\r\nsoldier was now convinced that it really was the Holy Virgin who had\r\nvisited him in the form of a bird. He remembered that he had asked\r\nNotre Dame de Lourdes to protect him on the day when he was injured.\r\nHe had, in fact, eaten a bit of cheese that day upon which he had\r\ninscribed a prayer to the Holy Virgin.\r\n\r\nSometimes he saw a red globe shining like a church lamp; sometimes\r\nwhite or black ladies descending from the sky; sometimes other visions.\r\nNow the Holy Virgin was to direct all the soldier’s life, but why\r\nshould he be specially favored? Was he not to be called sooner or\r\nlater to hold a high rank? He confessed, in fact, that he was to be\r\nthe King of France, and, like Joan of Arc, was to save his country.\r\nNow the soldier began to understand the hidden significance of his\r\nsurroundings. Everything around him was symbolic, thus, white, of\r\npurity, order and royalty; red, of anarchy, disorder and atheism. Some\r\nwhite ship which he saw outstripping some darker ship showed him how\r\nthe kingdom of France was arriving once more. In fact, there was a\r\nsymbolism in the whites and yolks of eggs, and the proportion of yolk\r\nto white was as one to five. He made talismans to exorcise bad spirits.\r\n\r\nWere there auditory hallucinations? If so, they were only episodic and\r\ntook no part in either the construction or the fixation of the man’s\r\ndelusional system. Thus, a voice once said to him, “All is not lost.\r\nYou will be ----.” May 25, 1917, he entered the neurological center at\r\nBourges.\r\n\r\nAs to the interpretation of this case, it seems that the patient’s\r\nmother had crises of depression which at one time caused her to be\r\ninterned in the Charité. The contributors of this case do not believe\r\nthat there can be any causal link set up between the mystical delusions\r\nand the brain injury.\r\n\r\nAs an auxiliary the soldier has a right to twenty per cent compensation\r\nfor his head wound with loss of substance without bulging of the\r\ndura mater. Of course, as an insane person he must be retired. The\r\naggravating or accelerating part played by fatigue, emotion and cranial\r\ntrauma must, from the standpoint of compensation, be taken into\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n=Case 160.= (WEYGANDT, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA subaltern who had been in the service since 1909 was on patrol\r\nunder shell fire from the enemy, but shortly thereafter came with his\r\ndetachment into the zone of the German fire. Six men, two steps away\r\nfrom him, were killed by a shell. The officer remained stationary with\r\nthe rest of his detachment until darkness set in, then returned, made\r\nhis report in due order, but thereafter tremors set in over his whole\r\nbody and he lost consciousness. He was carried to the hospital and on\r\nthe way met his best friend whom he did not recognize. Arrived at the\r\nhospital he was unable to give answers to questions or obey requests\r\nfor two or three hours. He thought he was hearing calls, commands and\r\na dull _dröhnen_. If an automobile passed he was frightened and cried,\r\n“Auto! Auto!” He remained subject to inhibition, anxiety and insomnia\r\nfor a long time; pulse accelerated; visual fields somewhat contracted\r\nfor red. Face asymmetrically innervated and dermatographia. Sent to the\r\nreserve hospital, he was still apprehensive, especially at night, but\r\nin the course of a few days became perfectly tranquil. Only if he took\r\npart in the singing of war songs did he feel transient sensations in\r\nhis knees.\r\n\r\nHere is a case of psychic shock with many traits, such as inhibition\r\nand hallucinations, suggestive of dementia praecox. The Abderhalden\r\nreactions (cortex, white matter, testes, not thyroid) all, according to\r\nWeygandt, are suggestive also of dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n=Case 161.= (DUPUOY, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA machine gunner, 23, was the sole survivor, March 18, 1915, of the\r\nexplosion of a large calibre shell in a block house containing ten men.\r\nHe worked himself out of the débris and came to Dupuoy’s attention in\r\nSeptember, when an extension of leave was asked for him.\r\n\r\nThere were two groups of symptoms; persistent headache, painful\r\nhyperacousia, vertigo, tremulous walk, cervical spinal column stiff and\r\npainful both spontaneously and to pressure, muscular weakness, tremor\r\nof hands, hypesthesia of extremities especially upper, exaggeration of\r\ntendon and bone reflexes with tendency to ankle clonus and patellar\r\nclonus, sterno sign lively, frequent nosebleeds (two to four times a\r\nweek), profound sweating, unequal pupils.\r\n\r\nOn the mental side it was clear that the man’s character had changed,\r\naccording to information supplied by the mother. Aprosexia, impairment\r\nof memory, recollective and retentive, inability to give age, birth\r\ndate and similar data. Words came with difficulty. Some disorder of\r\ncomprehension; stereotyped replies; negativism; indifference; he would\r\nsit hours in a chair or on a bed silent and inactive. Fixed attitudes;\r\ndull glance; eyelids half closed. In short, it seemed as if this\r\npatient was a case of catatonic dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n_Re_ dementia praecox and shell-shock, Stansfield remarks upon the\r\nsimilarity of certain symptoms found in Shell-shock to those of\r\ndementia praecox; for example, apathy, retardation, amnesia and speech\r\ndefect. According to Stansfield, one often gets the impression in a\r\nShell-shock case as though the trench and shell fire stress had merely\r\nbrought out a latent dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n_Re_ his new “sterno” sign (sternomastoid contraction on percussion\r\nof neck at level of third dorsal vertebra), Dupouy claims it negative\r\nin normal subjects, positive in concussion, meningitis, and general\r\nparesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; fatigue; fugue; delusions. Recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 162.= (ROUGE, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant, 40, had had nineteen years of service and had been married\r\nfive months when he was recalled to the colors when war broke out,\r\nand sent to the front. March, 1915, he was exposed to bomb explosions\r\nduring a very intense bombardment. He then got into the way of saying\r\nthat he was akin to everybody. April 20, he was evacuated on the score\r\nof general fatigue, rejoined the company May 17, left his comrades\r\nat the end of June, and was taken up as a deserter by the police,\r\nwho, observing his state, brought him to a hospital. He there showed\r\n“cerebral overexcitement” with “incoherence and nervousness.” In two or\r\nthree days he was much better. He was evacuated on the sixth day to the\r\nhospital at Vichy.\r\n\r\nThere was amnesia for the fugue and he could remember no further back\r\nthan the extraction of a tooth at the Vichy hospital. In fact, he\r\nattributed the fugue to this dental operation. His wife took him home,\r\nbut he soon threatened her with a revolver; got better in the night\r\nand next day went about apparently normal, buying things, however,\r\nextravagantly. His delusional state began once more, and two days later\r\nhe was brought to Limoux. It seems that, while in Mauretania, he had\r\nformerly shown signs of mental disorder, having a mania for wireless\r\nand airplane inventions and the like. A cousin-german had also been\r\nin a hospital for the insane twice, recovering each time. There was a\r\nlingual and manual tremor. The man had not been recently alcoholic. He\r\nwas a little irritable and showed a little megalomania, but worked hard\r\nand made himself useful. He went out, recovered, November 12, 1915.\r\n\r\nAnalysis indicated that this sergeant received a moral shock as a\r\nconsequence of his fatigue and the shell fire, which emerged in a spell\r\nof confusion. It may be that his predisposition had something to do\r\nalso with this spell and the fatigue. In any event, it seems as if the\r\nlatter phenomena were not all assignable to war stress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. CYCLOTHYMOSES\r\n\r\n(THE MANIC-DEPRESSIVE GROUP)\r\n\r\n\r\nA maniacal volunteer.\r\n\r\n=Case 163.= (BOUCHEROT, 1915-6.)\r\n\r\nAn Alsatian became the object of much attention when he enlisted at\r\nthe outbreak of the war in the infantry at the age of 59. He was\r\ninterviewed and soon became more than naturally exuberant. The peculiar\r\nthings he did soon brought him to Fleury in a gay and expansive mood,\r\nsinging and talking as hail fellow with everyone he met.\r\n\r\nThe next day he grew more excited, disrobed and threw his things out\r\nof the window, filled his bed with excrement and wanted to smear the\r\norderly therewith. He took other attendants for old friends and wanted\r\nto kiss them. His language and ideas were incoherent. He broke glass.\r\n\r\nThis situation of alternate joy and anger lasted one month, leaving\r\nhim in an excitable, unruly state. He wrote many prolix letters to\r\nthe prefects and the ministers, insisting on the discharge of certain\r\npatients and offering plans for the defense of France. He got better\r\nand finally, in October, 1914, was invalided home still slightly\r\nexalted.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the cyclothymias, Montembault remarks that manias have been less\r\nnumerous than melancholias in the present war, whereas in 1870, manias\r\nwere more common than melancholias. Morselli likewise remarks upon the\r\nrarity of manias amongst the Italian soldiers. Butenko reports upon the\r\nmaniacal cases amongst the Russians and how the men wish to enter the\r\nranks, the women the nurse corps. E. Meyer, for Germany, found 4 per\r\ncent manic-depressives. Birnbaum quotes from Bonhoeffer (3 per cent)\r\nand Hahn (2 per cent) for war times as against Stier’s 9.5 per cent of\r\ncyclothymic cases in the antebellum period, 1905-1906.\r\n\r\n\r\nFugue: melancholia.\r\n\r\n=Case 164.= (LOGRE, 1916.)\r\n\r\nLogre classifies as a melancholic fugue the adventures of a man who had\r\nbeen depressed for some days, had stopped talking and eating, and ran\r\naway suddenly in the middle of an attack of anxious agitation. He was\r\nvery anxious over the health of his daughter, whom he thought to be\r\nseverely ill. It was, in fact, to go to Paimpol that he deserted, but\r\nhe deserted with his arms and without any money. He went off on foot\r\n“in the Brittany direction.” He had gone 50 kilometers, the next day,\r\nand was picked up near Chateau-Thierry by two gendarmes, who fell upon\r\nhim, seeing his regalia, and cried, “Give yourself up!” He replied in\r\na firm voice, “No, I shall not give myself up!” and seizing his gun he\r\nmade at one of the gendarmes. There was a fight. The gendarme declared\r\nin his report that he judged it opportune to retreat behind a tree. The\r\nsoldier, knowing his trench lore very well, barricaded himself behind\r\na pile of beets. There he would have held the gendarmes in check for\r\nsome time if another had not succeeded by a détour through some woods,\r\nin catching him. He gave himself up after firing several ineffective\r\nshots, but not without getting a bullet in his left thigh himself.\r\nWith the charge of desertion and attempt to murder, he was handed\r\nover for mental examination. He was, in fact, a melancholic patient,\r\nsubject to attacks of anxiety, and requiring long observation at a\r\nneuropsychiatric center for diagnosis.\r\n\r\nChavigny observed numerous victims of melancholia characterized by\r\nwar terror. He remarks a somewhat curious fact that, whereas the\r\nmelancholics were numerous and their mental states related to the\r\nwar, on the other hand, the paretics were rather apt to be maniacal\r\nthan melancholic. Soukhanoff, however, remarks on the occurrence of\r\ndepression in a great number of types of psychosis, as was found\r\nin the Russo-Japanese war. Soukhanoff found frequent instances of\r\nschizophrenia, wherein the melancholia tends to conceal the actual\r\ndementia praecox. Soukhanoff predicted that depression will figure\r\nlargely in the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nApples in No-Man’s-Land.\r\n\r\n=Case 165.= (WEYGANDT, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in November, 1914, suddenly climbed out of the trench and\r\nbegan to pick apples from an apple-tree between the firing lines. The\r\nidea was to get a bag of apples for his comrades, but he began to pelt\r\nthe French trenches with apples. He was called back and on account of\r\nhis strange conduct sent to hospital. Here he was at times given to\r\npressure of speech and restlessness; he would climb the posts of the\r\nsleeping room and then loudly declare he wanted to get back to the\r\ntrenches; he did not want to go back to Germany alive; did not want to\r\nlive over to-morrow; was guilty of a sin; had a spot of sin, _Schand_,\r\non his heart. Sometimes he refused food and said anything else tasted\r\nbetter. It seemed he had formerly talked about the Iron Cross.\r\n\r\nAfter being transported to Germany, he was at first a little\r\nnegativistic and apparently blocked. He talked about his experiences\r\nand said he wanted to go to Russia. He explained the episode of the\r\napples on the basis that they were all really hungry and that he had\r\nsought to encourage his comrades who were unused to war. He had noticed\r\nthe French all shot too high.\r\n\r\nPhysically there was a somewhat uneven innervation of the face,\r\nunilateral epicanthus and an areflexia of pharynx. Now and then the man\r\nwas very irritable, but in general he was in an elevated frame of mind.\r\n\r\nWeygandt interprets this case as one of hypomania, remarking that\r\nwar influences may serve to bring out preëxisting manic depressive\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\n_Re_ differential development of mania and depression, see remarks\r\nunder Cases 163 (Boucherot) and 164 (Logre).\r\n\r\n\r\nFour months in trenches: Depression; war hallucinations,\r\narteriosclerosis (aged 38).\r\n\r\n=Case 166.= (GERVER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian reservist, a private, 38, went into the trenches, March,\r\n1915. Without taking part in any battles or sustaining any injury,\r\nhe four months later became depressed and had to be evacuated to a\r\nhospital and thence to the interior, little changed for the better.\r\n\r\nHe was an ill-nourished man, of middle height, with pallid skin and\r\nmembranes; arteries sclerotic; face, eyelids, and tongue finely\r\ntremulous; hands tremulous; slight dermatographia; exaggerated tendon\r\nreflexes; pulse 100.\r\n\r\nHe seemed disoriented for time and place; looked weary; walked with\r\nback bent over; spoke in whispers, and appeared somewhat unclear.\r\nThinking was slow and difficult.\r\n\r\nHe occasionally shuddered and looked to one side, said he was afraid,\r\nand was constantly troubled by thoughts of fire. The Germans were\r\npursuing him; he could hear their voices and footsteps. He himself\r\nwas doomed, and his family also; he felt he was the cause of all the\r\ndomestic woe. His own heart was dying away; he had fits of anguish and\r\ncauseless fear, and was under the constant expectation of death.\r\n\r\nOne day, he escaped from the hospital and went to the chief physician’s\r\ntent, where he lay on the ground. When he was found and asked why he\r\nwas there, he begged the physician to save him from the Germans. The\r\nman was not alcoholic and had no previous history of mental disease.\r\n\r\n_Re_ early arteriosclerosis, Maitland in the second interim report of\r\nthe British Association Committee on Fatigue in Warfare, speaks of the\r\nmany Serbians, who, after six years of nearly continuous Balkan war,\r\nshow a marked arteriosclerosis. Maitland remarks that the line officers\r\nwere already showing (1916) a growing delicacy of perception as to the\r\n“breaking point.” Men that do not break may return from the lines,\r\npale, with low blood pressure, and a _faiblesse irritable_, shown by\r\nrestlessness of hands and feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar stress: Manic-depressive psychosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 167.= (DUMESNIL, 1915-6.)\r\n\r\nA naval officer, 22, transferred from sea service, went into Belgium,\r\nNovember, 1914, in a Fusilleur brigade of marines and there greatly\r\ndistinguished himself, growing very weary and enervated, however,\r\nabout the middle of April, 1915. His attitude to the men altered:\r\nhe sometimes struck them; gently, though, according to his account.\r\nThey must do in ten seconds what they really could not do under ten\r\nminutes. The officer, in fact, had lost all notion of time. He went\r\nabout agitatedly, contradicted his superior officers and was troubled\r\nbecause, as he said, they often were men of inexperience as compared to\r\nhimself. He grew irritated, too, because there were Free Masons in the\r\narmy and when he was sent to the asylum in July, 1915, said it was the\r\ndoing of the Free Masons. He did not seem to have any hallucinations.\r\nHis ideas and sentiments were very labile, and a bit confused, and not\r\nall his interpretations dealt with Free Masons and occultism. August\r\n5, however, the phase of calmness was again followed by agitation;\r\nhe broke things and laughed explosively. August 10, another attack\r\noccurred, with destructiveness. During the next few days there were\r\nalternate phases of depression and excitation. He was negativistic,\r\nresistive and struck attendants.\r\n\r\n_Re_ war stress and psychoses, Morselli finds the acute cases on\r\npsychopathic soil. First in the list, he places the neurasthenias and\r\npsychasthenias, and second, the hysterias, two groups which, more than\r\nthe remainder, may be said to constitute the so-called Shell-shock\r\ngroup. Third, he found depressions ranging over into a delusional\r\nstate with suicidal ideas; fourth, a species of stupor, occasionally\r\ncatatonic, recalling dementia praecox; fifth, transient hallucinatory\r\nstates; sixth, confusions (Meynert’s amentia?); last, manias.\r\n\r\nThe above case of Dumesnil appears to be a pure case of\r\nmanic-depressive psychosis developing on the war basis, but perhaps\r\nmerely comes from a latent cyclothymia.\r\n\r\n\r\nPredisposition; war stress: Melancholia.\r\n\r\n=Case 168.= (DUMESNIL, 1915-6.)\r\n\r\nA farmer, 30, was mobilized August 2, 1914, and was wounded in the\r\nhand September 27. He went back to his dépôt in December and stayed\r\nthere until March, 1915, when he was sent to Dunkirk. Before leaving\r\nthe dépôt he said that he had heard soldiers declaring that he was not\r\ndoing his duty, that he was going to be court-martialed, that life was\r\nat an end for him. At Dunkirk he said these same soldiers continued to\r\nsay the same things about him, forming a band about him, led off by a\r\nsubaltern officer who meant to frighten him and to make him talk. One\r\nnight sulphur was thrown at him for poisoning purposes; he complained\r\nof this to a sergeant and declared he did not understand why he should\r\nbe thus pursued. After the bombardment of Dunkirk the hallucinations\r\ngrew more intense. He was sent to hospital and was so harried by the\r\nvoices that he wanted to throw himself down a staircase but was caught\r\nin time. At the hospital for the insane he complained that his thoughts\r\nwere being heard and loudly repeated; he was made to make incoördinate\r\nmovements; was treated as a spy. He thought he must be a German or they\r\nwould not treat him so. He waited for death as he wanted to be executed\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nThis man’s father was alcoholic. He himself at the age of fourteen had\r\nhad a period of neurasthenia with some sort of nervous seizure for a\r\nperiod of five months. At 28 he had a rheumatic seizure which kept him\r\nin bed fifty days. A daughter born to his wife had died a few days\r\nafter birth.\r\n\r\nDumesnil’s analysis is melancholia with delusions of persecution, due\r\nto war stress in a predisposed person.\r\n\r\n_Re_ melancholia and the war stress, see remarks under Case 167. _Re_\r\nmanic-depressive psychosis in the Russians, Khoroshko found 9.4 per\r\ncent of manic-depressive cases, the same percentage of epilepsies, 10\r\nper cent of paretics, and 20.4 per cent of schizophrenic cases amongst\r\na group of 318 neuro-psychiatric cases. Almost all his manic-depressive\r\ncases had been patently so antebellum.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepression; low blood pressure. Pituitrin.\r\n\r\n=Case 169.= (GREEN, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private, 22, was sent back from Germany as insane. He had been in the\r\nasylum at Giessen seven months, and a prisoner in all fifteen months.\r\n\r\nAugust 16, 1916, he was admitted to Mott’s wards at Maudsley in a\r\nmarkedly depressed and lethargic condition. He had improved somewhat\r\nin October, but still had periods of depression. He was put on thyroid\r\nextract (Green’s treatment was in doses measuring from gr. ¼ to gr.\r\n1, t.d.s.; according to Green, the effect of thyroid extract is more\r\nrapid when coupled with pituitrin). In December he was given pituitrin\r\nextract gr. 2, t.d.s. In January, 1917, he was no longer depressed or\r\nlethargic. He complained of pain in his back, found to be due to a\r\nbullet. This was removed.\r\n\r\n_Re_ prisoners, Imboden found amongst 20,000 French soldiers taken\r\nprisoner at Verdun after the severest drum fire and strain, only\r\nfive neurotic cases (data of Mörchen), and Wilmanns found but five\r\nneurotic cases amongst 80,000 prisoners. Lust reviewed 20,000 war\r\nprisoners in Germany and found singularly few instances of neurosis.\r\nShunkoff notes, however, that there are a number of psychotic cases\r\namongst the prisoners because the _mentally_ diseased who do not\r\ndisturb the military routine are kept in the line. Bonhoeffer found\r\namongst Serbians taken prisoners by Germany, emaciation, atrophy,\r\nheart disease, and frequently tuberculosis. (See Case 166.) Bonhoeffer\r\nnoted the absence of psychoses amongst these Serbians, drawing the\r\ngeneral conclusion that campaign stress was unable to bring out\r\npsychoses. But, although the exhaustion psychoses are not found,\r\nthere are exhaustion neuroses or states of acute nervous exhaustion,\r\ncharacterized by somnolence and depression, followed by a mild degree\r\nof overemotionality. vum Busch states that interned German civilians\r\nhave gone into psychosis frequently. It is said that one in 10,000\r\nwar prisoners in Germany has committed suicide. Bishop Bury found at\r\nRuhleben 60 or 70 cases of psychosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. PSYCHONEUROSES\r\n\r\n\r\nHallucination in the field (surprise by _BOCHES_); scalp wound: Three\r\npsychopathic phases--(_a_) over-emotionality, (_b_) obsessions, (_c_)\r\nloss of feeling of reality (victim a “constitutional _intimiste_”).\r\n\r\n=Case 170.= (LAIGNEL-LAVASTINE and COURBON, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA cashier, 31 (of rather weak constitution but without hereditary\r\nor acquired mental taint--a religious man and for religious reasons\r\nchaste, always given to metaphysical speculation and introspection, but\r\non the other hand, much interested in sports and very sympathetic with\r\nEnglish manners), was about to go to live in the country on the advice\r\nof his physician when the war broke out. He was called to the colors\r\nand shortly lost his tendency to bronchitis, put on flesh, and felt\r\ndelighted with his situation.\r\n\r\nAfter almost two years of effective service, June 2, 1916, when his\r\ntroop was cautiously advancing into a trench at the end of which they\r\nmight be taken by surprise, suddenly the officer cried, “_Sauve qui\r\npeut!_ _The Boches are on us!_” The patient remembered seeing Germans\r\nemerge from every side, remembered his fear, how he had turned about\r\nand crossed over a palisade, and then no more until he found a scalp\r\nwound being staunched by his comrades in the trench. He put on his own\r\ndressing and followed his comrades on foot.\r\n\r\nHe quickly got well of his scalp-wound but remained in hospital,\r\nvery weak, extremely impressionable, jumping at every noise. He got\r\nsomewhat better with the rest in bed, though even a month after his\r\nhallucination, he had a spell of insomnia, thinking about his future\r\nand the possibility of a relapse, and having war dreams from which he\r\nwould awake in a sweat. Once on awaking, he distinctly heard a voice\r\nsaying, “_Well, Charles?_” This hallucination occurred five times,\r\nunder exactly the same circumstances, except that once it was in the\r\ndaylight. Adrenalin was given, 1:1000, 10 drops the first day, 20 the\r\nsecond, 30 the third, and a like amount on the following days. After\r\nthree days of such treatment, the patient said he felt much better.\r\nLater he had a period in which he had lost self-control and could no\r\nlonger take any initiative. Thus, if he wanted to reply to his mother,\r\nit seemed to him that some one not himself was ordering him to write.\r\nHe now asked himself if he were not really dreaming. He would not be\r\nsure of his actual existence unless something happened to prove it,\r\nsuch as the nurse’s bringing him a plate.\r\n\r\nIn short as the first phase of diffuse over-emotionality had been\r\nsucceeded by a second of obsessions, so the obsessive phase was\r\nsucceeded by a third phase of mild loss of the feeling of reality.\r\nThe first phase following the wound was one of disorder of attention,\r\nof memory, and in fact of all the mental functions, associated with\r\ntremors, tachycardia and dizziness. The second phase seemed, as it\r\nwere, to crystallize intellectually the anxious apprehensiveness of the\r\nfirst phase. There were fears that the ceiling would fall; there were\r\nscruples concerning the past; there were fearful premonitions for the\r\nfuture (such as, that any bomb he might pick up would burst). According\r\nto Laignel-Lavastine and Courbon, there may have been a predisposition\r\nin the vegetative system of this subject, or even a basis in his\r\ntuberculosis, of which, in fact, the X-ray showed still some slight\r\nevidences. The obsessions appeared at night, at a time, namely, when\r\nthe vital rhythm is passing from a sympathotonic period over into a\r\nvagotonic period, at a time when the organic sensations are apt to swim\r\nto the fore. According to this analysis, these somatic sensations,\r\nprecisely those that the battlefield had also brought out, brought out\r\nagain the other emotions which he had felt on service. It was always\r\nthe emotions first developed in military service that were revived in\r\nthe disease. In the third phase, the physical condition of the patient\r\nhad grown much better _pari passu_ with disappearance of the obsessions\r\nand the onset of the personality disorder. The adrenalin raised\r\narterial tension, and going down to the sympathetic caused the anxiety\r\nand war emotions linked therewith to disappear; but the adrenalin\r\ntreatment, according to Laignel-Lavastine and Courbon, disturbed the\r\norganic sensations so suddenly that there was a break between the new\r\nconscious status and the old. In consequence, the patient felt that\r\nthese new sensations no longer really belonged to him but were of a\r\nxenic character, imposed upon him from without in such wise that he\r\ncontinually asked himself whether he was really dreaming or no. This\r\nman was a constitutional _intimiste_; a psychasthenic _en herbe_.\r\n\r\n_Re_ neurasthenia, Lépine notes that there are transient and relatively\r\npermanent cases. The term is often used to cover graver disorders,\r\nsuch as various melancholias and anxieties. As a rule, in France, the\r\nneurasthenics are evacuated for fatigue. There have been a number of\r\ncases in officers, who find themselves unable to make decisions on\r\nthe minute and to remember military facts, or perhaps are unable to\r\nmake any physical or intelligent effort whatever. A true neurasthenic,\r\nhowever, ought not to be a confused person. He is a man with a rather\r\nunusual clarity of view as to his situation; and his trouble appears\r\nto him to be somatic rather than as of the nature of a depression. He\r\nfeels that, if he could only rest, he could be cured. Neurasthenia,\r\naccording to Lépine’s war experience, is practically always the\r\ndisease of a highly cultivated nervous system, and appears in men\r\nwho have undertaken responsibilities. There is a group of young men\r\nwho have never been physically strong, bowled over at last by some\r\nsmall event, such as a diarrhoea, and unable to carry on. Such men,\r\nperhaps, are likely to have some traces of an old tuberculosis, an\r\nadrenal insufficiency, or insufficient hepatic function. Martinet has\r\nfound them hypotensive and rather poorly aerated. There is another\r\ngroup of neurasthenics (Maurice of Fleury) that are old arthritics,\r\nwith increased tension. These cases are not found at the front because\r\nconditions there rather tend to reduce the trouble; but they are\r\nfound doing office work in the interior. Besides these cases of the\r\n“cultivated” group, Lépine also finds a number of neurasthenics amongst\r\nthe peasants, in whom anxious ideas may lead to hypochondria.\r\n\r\n\r\nFugue, hysterical.\r\n\r\n=Case 171.= (MILIAN, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nThe fugue of an adjutant who left his regimental relief post at\r\nPalameix Farm and was found several days later with his family at\r\nCastelsarrasin, was reconstructed from partial records as follows:\r\n\r\nNovember 27, 1914, after a night in the trenches, when two shells burst\r\nnear him, the adjutant turned up at the relief post with wild eyes\r\nand a complaint of fatigue, and of an old wound and headaches. The\r\nwound he had gotten in a fight which gained him his grade of adjutant.\r\nThe physician prescribed rest. He sat down by the stove, silent and\r\ndejected, and at about four o’clock, in the presence of the medical\r\nassistant, made preparations to go, leaving sack and saber behind, but\r\ntaking outer garments and revolver case. On the way from the farm, he\r\nmet comrades and told them he had been evacuated to his dépôt on the\r\ncolonel’s order, and walked with them, Indian file, in the midst of\r\nfalling shells, the others talking but the adjutant himself silent.\r\nAt nightfall, he said, “Good evening,” and parted from them. Of his\r\nfurther course to his home, all recollection was lost by the adjutant;\r\nin fact, he did not remember anything beyond the Palameix Farm, where\r\nhe had seen a comrade wounded in the head. He got home November 29th,\r\nat eight in the morning. He had most of his money with him, having\r\ntraveled by train some distance without a ticket; moreover, without\r\nasking for a ticket, and without having eaten. When the ticketman in\r\nhis home town asked him whether he was back from the war, he looked\r\nat him vaguely and went out without replying; nor did he reply to a\r\nnewspaper man on the road home. This was the more strange as he was\r\nordinarily an affable person.\r\n\r\nHe had a convulsive crisis at home, after which he was exhausted and\r\napparently unable to move or reply. A physician said that he had had\r\na cerebral shock. When the police arrived, two hours later, he was\r\napparently delirious, saying such things as, “_The Christians want\r\nto shoot me but I know the rules! Come, boys, stay in the trenches!_”\r\n“_There are two more dead ones!_” etc. During the day he recovered\r\nconsciousness and was greatly disturbed at his military crime.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, he had had, at the age of 17, analogous crises, as\r\nwas certified by Régis, who had cared for him from 1907 to 1909 for\r\nhysteria with sudden somnambulistic attacks and amnesia.\r\n\r\nWhile in prison after his arrest, he also had hysterical crises with\r\nagitation, flushed face, hard attempts to vomit, respiratory disorder\r\ndue to interference in the throat (globus hystericus), and delirious\r\nphenomena (“Germans had followed him home”).\r\n\r\nAfter his birth his mother had had two miscarriages and a stillborn\r\nchild. The adjutant was declared irresponsible and acquitted. This is\r\napparently an instance of hysteria without stigmata.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical Adventist.\r\n\r\n=Case 172.= (DE LA MOTTE, August, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn engineer, 31, in the Landwehr at the outset of the campaign, was\r\nfirst put on sentry service in Berlin on the ground that he was\r\nan Adventist. He was later put into the military service and had\r\ndifficulty because he did not want to serve on Sunday. He was shoved\r\nfrom one company to another. He refused to be inoculated and was\r\narrested therefor. In the prison, he began to hear God’s voice calling\r\nto him distinctly to tell his fellow-men that the end of this was going\r\nto be the end of all things. Back in the barracks, he again heard a\r\nvoice--“_Come forth!_”--“_Go!_” He went! He had his revelations then\r\npublished in the form of tracts, and held Bible readings day and night\r\namong his friends in Bremen--looking for the signs of the times in the\r\nBible sayings. One of his fellow Adventists finally warned the police,\r\nand the military authorities put him under psychiatric observation. He\r\nproved to have numerous stigmata of hysteria. He talked freely about\r\nhis visions, and was aware that he was punishable.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was a case of hysterical psychosis, liberated by military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFugue, psychoneurotic.\r\n\r\n=Case 173.= (LOGRE.)\r\n\r\nThe question, Is this escape really a fugue? is brought up not only\r\nin epileptic, alcoholic, and melancholic cases, but also in cases\r\nsuggestive of psychoneurosis. A son of an insane person was subject\r\nto what may be called a phobic or obsessive fugue. The case may be\r\ncalled one of morbid cowardice and was observed in a soldier in the\r\ntrenches. In point of fact, the man had always been an anxious and\r\nfearsome person, given to phobias. He had night terrors and fear of\r\ndiseases and death. He was agoraphobic in adolescence, and had to have\r\na policeman or passerby go with him through a public place. He had had\r\nalso suicidal and homicidal obsessions, and periods of psychoneurotic\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nThis man’s sojourn at the front put his morbid personality to a cruel\r\ntest. He was soon known by all in the trenches as a _froussard_. He had\r\na terrible fear of the guns, jumped, grew pale, trembled, complained\r\nof palpitations, lumps in the throat, etc. He was the laughing-stock\r\nof his comrades; but according to the patient himself, he was more\r\nafraid of his own emotion than of the shells, although his comrades\r\ncouldn’t understand it. He was employed as a kitchenman, in a post not\r\nmuch exposed. A more resolute comrade helped him to escape, escaping\r\nalso himself, thus bringing up the problem of _fugue á deux_. Limited\r\nresponsibility was decided for the case, although the fugue had been\r\naided by his morbid anxiety. Of course, his place was not in the\r\ntrenches at all. He was condemned to two years in prison. After his\r\nsentence, he was given a chance to rehabilitate himself by sending him\r\nagain to the trenches, but he had to be evacuated a few weeks later on\r\naccount of his increasing emotionality.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shy; war bride pregnant: Fugue with amnesia and mutism.\r\n\r\n=Case 174.= (MYERS, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA rifleman, 30 years old, was brought to a casualty clearing\r\nstation, looking like an imbecile, with a history of having wandered\r\nabout aimlessly, not knowing where he was or what he was doing. On\r\nquestioning, he remained absolutely speechless and terrified. Four days\r\nlater, in conversation with Major Myers, he was got to speak in a faint\r\nvoice about his wife, home, and occupation, saying that the month was\r\nOctober (when it was actually August) and that he had been in France\r\ntwo months, when it was actually twelve. He described emotionally\r\ncertain trench scenes, and then thought of his wife sewing.\r\n\r\nHypnotized, he remembered going into a dug-out after running away from\r\nshells; he was made to talk in a loud voice. Next day, during hypnosis,\r\nproper orientation for time reappeared. He was got to write an ordinary\r\nsoldier’s letter to his wife. The following day he was active, making\r\nbeds, but was mute (there was a case of mutism in the same ward). Under\r\nhypnosis speech returned. He had gone to a horse show, and upon his\r\nreturn, something hit his back; shells had begun to fall. Found hiding\r\nin a shack, he was carried to a hospital in an ambulance. After this\r\nhypnotic treatment, the power of speech was maintained, although his\r\nvoice became faint or failed whenever he was asked about the incidents\r\ndescribed above. Next day he waked speaking normally, nudging his\r\nneighbor and asking, “Is it me that’s talking?” He had before appeared\r\ndull and depressed, but now appeared an intelligent, agreeable, and\r\ngarrulous fellow. It appears that his wife was a war bride and he had\r\nheard some months since that she was pregnant. He had been troubled,\r\nthinking she was in money difficulties and kept thinking about a friend\r\nwhose wife had lost her first baby. Recovery appears to be complete\r\nexcept for occasional headaches, and the patient is now serving in his\r\nreserve battalion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA neurasthenic volunteer.\r\n\r\n=Case 175.= (E. SMITH, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man who volunteered for service at the outbreak of the war (he had\r\nrecently been an inmate of a sanatorium) was sent back to England as\r\nneurasthenic after three trying months at the front. The case sheet\r\nread that he was subject to dazed conditions. In hospital he suffered\r\nfrom insomnia, and before his slight periods of sleep he constantly had\r\nvisions of two comrades who had been terribly lacerated at his side.\r\nThese hallucinations in their reality aroused in him a fear that he was\r\ninsane.\r\n\r\nThere were also terrifying dreams, beginning with episodes at the front\r\nand ending with sex experiences. These dreams were ended by seminal\r\nemissions. These formed a second cause for the patient’s belief that\r\nhe was insane, as he said he remembered literature read as a boy\r\nconcerning spermatorrhoea.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of this case the writings of psychologists who\r\nhad studied hypnagogic experiences were used and the absence of\r\nhallucinations during waking hours was stressed. The remembered\r\nliterature regarding spermatorrhoea was discounted by the rational\r\nexplanation of his state.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be getting on well when a trivial accident caused a\r\nrelapse. While he was saying goodby to his wife, who had visited him,\r\nshe was taken ill, and he went home with her. He was punished for being\r\nlate in returning to the hospital. Although no moral stigma attaches\r\nto confinements in barracks in most soldiers’ minds, in this man a\r\ndepression was produced and suicidal talk followed. It seems that his\r\nfather had been sent to jail when he was a child, and he felt he had\r\nbeen tainted by his father in such wise that his “criming” was due\r\nto heredity. With the removal of this misconception he became more\r\nrational and immensely improved.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive months’ war experience: Neurasthenia in subject without heredity\r\nor soil.\r\n\r\n=Case 176.= (JOLLY, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA 38-year old soldier is Jolly’s example of a neurasthenia produced in\r\na person without previous neurasthenic traits or hereditary factors.\r\nThis soldier had been a moderately good student and never ill. He\r\nwent into the battle line in December, 1914, and came out in May,\r\n1915, on account of exhaustion. The case is not wholly convincing\r\nsince the patient had a shrapnel injury of the skull, described as of\r\nso inconsiderable a degree that he was not put on the sick list on\r\nits account. The patient finally arrived at the Nuremberg Hospital,\r\ncomplaining of pressure in the head, as if there was a band around\r\nthe head, and dizziness. He wept a good deal saying that the sight\r\nof the dead had frightened him. Sleep was restless and there were\r\nunpleasant dreams of the battle field. Intelligence was not in any\r\ndegree disturbed. The supra-orbital points were sensitive to pressure.\r\nThe tongue showed a marked tremor and was coated; the mechanical\r\nexcitability of the muscles was increased; and there was reddening of\r\nthe skin on stroking. There was a fine tremor of the extended fingers,\r\nless tremor of the head and of the body at large. Knee-jerks normal.\r\nNutrition well preserved. Partial recovery in the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportance of arterial hypotension in the diagnosis of psychasthenia.\r\n\r\n=Case 177.= (CROUZON, March, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man of 32 (never well, with general weakness, ideas of consumption\r\nand vacuous thinking following a good recovery from bronchitis at 28,\r\nunsuccessful in business, subject to weaknesses) had had eighteen\r\nmonths antebellum of what might be called psychasthenia. There were\r\nspells of loss of consciousness without convulsions, and probably of\r\nhysterical nature. There had been for two years insomnia and a general\r\nhypobulic slowing down of work.\r\n\r\nIn military service the crises became more frequent, coming two or\r\nthree times a week. Tuberculosis could not be shown, nor was there any\r\norganic lesion of the nervous system. The arterial tension (Potain\r\nsphygmomanometer) stood at 11.\r\n\r\nAccording to Crouzon, arterial hypotension is an objective sign\r\ntending to assure the organic nature of a psychasthenia. Whereas\r\nsimple neurasthenics are hypertensive, others have long been\r\nrecognized as hypotensive; but heart experts have recognized this\r\nasthenic hypotension more than psychiatrists or neurologists. In\r\ndifferential diagnosis it is necessary to consider and exclude the\r\nearly hypotensions of pulmonary tuberculosis and those of Addison’s\r\ndisease. This hypotension is most frequently observed in constitutional\r\nneurasthenics and psychasthenics. Hypertensive drugs, adrenalin,\r\ntincture of colchicum, have produced a transitory improvement in a\r\nnumber of cases, but the amelioration has halted with the stoppage of\r\nthe drugs.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hypotensive and hypertensive cases, see remarks of Lépine under\r\nCase 176. See also Case 169, illustrating some contentions of Green,\r\nfrom Mott’s clinic.\r\n\r\n\r\nService in France and Salonica: Psychasthenia.\r\n\r\n=Case 178.= (EDER, March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man, 29, after some months’ service (three months in France and\r\nlater in Salonica) was invalided for backache, insomnia, and enuresis.\r\nIt seems that this married man had never done any work after leaving\r\nschool at 18, having substantial private means. He had been married\r\nfor 3½ years, had a son, and was, according to Eder, perhaps morbidly\r\nattached to his wife and child. He had been a sportsman and was\r\nselected for sniping work in France. The son of a shipbuilder, he had\r\nalways planned all kinds of ships and engines, never to be used. After\r\nseeing the world, he was about to enter his father’s business when he\r\nhad to take care of his father in a nervous breakdown. After a second\r\nattack, the man never entered business.\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, 1916, wide-spread patchy analgesia and lumbar hyperesthesia\r\nwere found. He thought sluggishly, being restless and holding attention\r\npoorly. He began twenty letters, destroying each after finishing a\r\nfew lines. He was shy and felt that everybody was looking at him. He\r\nbecame speechless if he had to address his commanding officer. He had\r\nan obsession to mark each flagstone and touch each post, and various\r\ncounting and arranging obsessions.\r\n\r\nThe _Horme_ (Jung) was elusive. A dream: “I was in a cargo boat in\r\nthe river; we were steering straight into ferry and harbor. The pilot\r\nrang down ‘Full speed to stern’; I pushed him out of the way, and rang\r\ndown ‘Full speed ahead, two points to starboard.’ We went straight\r\npast ferry and harbor without accident.” Again, a few days later, “In\r\na motor car, came to some rocks which sprang up in front of me. The\r\nmachine broke down. I abandoned it and clambered over the rocks. It was\r\ntough work. My object was a ship. I got to the ship, took hold of the\r\nwrench, and signalled ‘Let go.’” Herein, according to Eder, are certain\r\nobvious symbolic conversions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntebellum attacks, with dizziness: Fainting on horseback. Neurasthenia.\r\n\r\n=Case 179.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA harness-maker, 37, a corporal, was called to the colors on the second\r\nday of mobilization. He was attacked by a slight dizziness in the\r\nevening (see previous history below). He went into the field on August\r\n7 and had repeated attacks of dizziness, despite which he took part in\r\nseveral skirmishes. He could not ride on horseback, since dizziness,\r\nringing in the ears, headaches, and trembling of the whole body would\r\ndevelop. October 27 a severe fainting attack came while he was sitting\r\non a horse. He woke ten hours later, vomited several times and felt\r\ndazed. Two weeks later hearing in the right ear began to be impaired.\r\nDuring several transfers from hospital to hospital near the East front,\r\nthere were two more severe attacks of dizziness and vomiting. Brought\r\nback to Germany, the patient finally came to the Jena Hospital, May 20.\r\n\r\nThe estimate of this case depends somewhat on the previous history. He\r\nappears to have come from a healthy family, was married, and had two\r\nhealthy children. His bodily and mental development had been normal;\r\nhe had been an unusually good scholar, but he stammered from his tenth\r\nyear without apparent reason. He had had treatment in an institution\r\nfor stammerers at 17, achieving a complete cure in six weeks. His\r\nmilitary service was as a cavalryman, 1897-1900, after which he had\r\nmarried. There was no excess in alcohol; he was not a smoker. From his\r\nown account, he had always been somewhat nervous, had trembled easily,\r\nand had fallen to stammering when excited. In 1913 there had occurred,\r\nafter physical exertion, three violent attacks of fainting, with\r\ndizziness, vomiting, and excessive perspiration, each attack lasting\r\nfrom two to three hours. However, from that time to just before the\r\nwar, he had been free from attacks.\r\n\r\nOn examination at the Jena Hospital, the patient complained of general\r\nweariness, a feeling of pressure in the back of his head, a hammering\r\nall over the head, ringing in the right ear, impairment of hearing in\r\nthis ear, a feeling of dizziness on raising the head, palpitation of\r\nheart, especially at night, occasional trembling of the whole body, and\r\nabsolute inability to walk.\r\n\r\nThe man was slenderly built, of medium height, in moderate\r\nnutrition; pale of face and mucosae; pulse small, regular, and 114.\r\nNeurologically, the deep reflexes were generally increased, and the\r\nskin reflexes decreased. Percussion on the back of the head elicited\r\nmarked pain. There were no pressure points. The movements of the arms\r\nwere free; there was a marked tremor of both hands, more marked on the\r\nright. The left grasp was 45, the right, 20, by the dynamometer.\r\n\r\nWhen lying upon his back, the patient could move his legs, but he\r\nmoved them only slowly and with tremor. The heel-to-knee test was\r\nsuccessfully executed despite the tremor; nor could it be demonstrated\r\nthat there was a genuine ataxia. Placed upon his feet, he would\r\ncollapse, nor could he be made to walk at all. With trunk supported,\r\nhe was able to make only a few unsuccessful attempts to drag the feet\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nAssociated with this apparent paralysis, the sensitiveness to touch\r\nhad entirely ceased in the legs, as well as sensitiveness to pain. The\r\nzone of analgesia, however, was more extensive than the anesthesia,\r\nspreading upwards three or four cm. farther in front. Ticking of the\r\nwatch could not be heard even at the meatus of the right ear, although\r\nhearing of the left ear was entirely normal; bone transmission on the\r\nleft side. Whispers could be heard close to the meatus. On speaking,\r\nthe patient stammered in starting sentences.\r\n\r\nHe looked extremely anxious during the first few days in the Jena\r\nwards, claiming that he could not raise himself. When his trunk was\r\nraised, he would let himself sink feebly back into dorsal decubitus.\r\nHowever, when believing himself unobserved, he was found to be able\r\nto move himself in bed somewhat quickly. He was able to get a box\r\nfrom beneath the bed, to open the drawer of the night-stand, and to\r\ntake remarkable care of his moustachios. He complained more and more\r\nof headache, though his appetite and sleep were good. He was often\r\nirritable.\r\n\r\nTreatment at first consisted of cold packs of the legs twice a day,\r\nsalt-water baths, active and passive exercises of the legs in the\r\nposition of dorsal decubitus. The patient declaimed against this\r\ntreatment. There was slight improvement after a week of treatment. He\r\nwas then able to raise himself in bed, seat himself on the edge of\r\nthe bed, and stand without support, all the time, however, groaning\r\nand moaning. After a few moments, he would fall back on the bed,\r\ncomplaining of violent headache and dizziness. While standing, both\r\nlegs trembled.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntityphoid inoculation: Neurasthenia.\r\n\r\n=Case 180.= (CONSIGLIO, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA corporal, 39, began to be sleepless and weary, with headache, pains\r\nin the back, and dizziness. He was homesick. Upon hospital examination\r\nhe was very variable in mood, rather hostile in attitude, and at the\r\nsame time suggestible. He was so confident of being sent home that he\r\nanticipated the diagnosis by sending his belongings back to Sicily at\r\nthe time he was transferred to hospital from his regiment.\r\n\r\nAfter a month’s rest and psychotherapy, the man’s general condition\r\nwas greatly improved; he was no longer sleepless and had no longer any\r\nsign of neurotic disorder. He still maintained that his memory was\r\nweak, although in point of fact his memory was very good and quick. He\r\ncould narrate all the facts about his neurasthenic state. The man’s\r\ncomplaints were out of all proportion to any demonstrable somatic\r\ndisorder. He was discharged, cured, to be put to work at shoemaking,\r\nwith the diagnosis, neurasthenia. This neurasthenic state developed\r\nafter antityphoid injection.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the occasional curious effects of antityphoid injection, see Case\r\n65.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurasthenia (monosymptomatic: Sympathy with the enemy).\r\n\r\n=Case 181.= (STEINER, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA non-commissioned reserve officer, 26, in civil life a merchant, had a\r\nstrong hereditary taint, having been also in peace times very nervous\r\nand on that account obliged to give up his studies. At the age of 14,\r\nhe had seen a man fall down from a roof and was much excited about it.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of mobilization he suffered a functional aphonia for\r\na few days. He could not let his men shoot at the enemy because of an\r\nidea that occurred forcibly to him: that the enemy’s soldiers had wives\r\nand children! He felt badly on this account. Later he had a constant\r\ntaste of blood in his mouth and a smell of corpses in his nose. Toward\r\nnightfall all these symptoms would change for the worse, and the\r\nsymptoms would become especially bad whenever he had anything to do\r\nwith the wounded. He tended to weep much and was easily frightened and\r\nhad also various physical symptoms of neurasthenia.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the amazing sympathy with the enemy, see Case 229 (Binswanger) and\r\nCase 554 (Arinstein), in which chloroform lifted from a German and a\r\nRussian consciousness respectively opposite emotional tendencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock CLAUSTROPHOBIA: Preferred shell exposure to shell-proof\r\ntunnel.\r\n\r\n=Case 182.= (STEINER, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA colleague of Steiner, an army physician, 35 years of age, with strong\r\nhereditary taint, having two sick sisters (one dementia praecox), had\r\nbeen incapacitated for work through a neurasthenia a few months before\r\nmobilization. However, at first he felt very well, marching through\r\nBelgium and into Northern France.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 17th of October, 1914, a shell struck the house\r\nnext where he was and startled him up out of sleep. After that,\r\nespecially at nightfall, upon entering a cellar he would have the\r\nfeeling of the ceiling falling down, and he would go restlessly from\r\none space to another. Afterwards, any closed room, however secure or\r\ndistant from the front and free from shells, would give him the feeling\r\nof the ceiling about to fall down. He could no longer sit quietly\r\nanywhere, but walked about and avoided the company of others.\r\n\r\nA characteristic observation is the following as described by the\r\nphysician himself: There was an absolutely shell-proof tunnel running\r\nto the position at the front where he was on duty. It took about 25\r\nminutes to go through the tunnel, but on account of his feelings\r\nhe could not bring himself to use this tunnel but walked over the\r\nexposed hill which was frequently shelled. Curiously enough, after the\r\nappearance of the first symptoms, a shell exploded nearby without any\r\nmarked psychical effect. This happened about noon. The obsessions were\r\nstronger in the evening. Objectively, there were neurasthenic symptoms\r\nof a bodily nature; there was vasomotor excitability. He was depressed,\r\nwept easily, and showed lack of decision; he had tormenting thoughts\r\nthat he had not fulfilled his duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. PSYCHOPATHOSES\r\n\r\n(GROUP OF VARIOUS PSYCHOPATHIAS)\r\n\r\n\r\nA case of Pathological Lying occurring in a soldier.\r\n\r\n=Case 183.= (HENDERSON, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nNo. 27369, a private, attached to the 15th Battalion Durham Light\r\nInfantry, was admitted Oct. 14, 1916, to Lord Derby War Hospital from\r\nNetley.\r\n\r\nSeptember 11, 1916, he had been admitted to Number 3 General Hospital,\r\nFrance, in a noisy, excited, insolent state: said he saw spirits of\r\nthe dead; heard his sister urging him to lead a better life. Admitted\r\nto Netley early in October, 1916: now said he was a spiritualist, a\r\nFrenchman, had a quarrel with parents and enlisted in British Army,\r\nin army service; went to France August 12, 1914, was wounded at Loos,\r\nSeptember, 1915, returned to front in February, 1916, “shell-shocked”\r\nJune 1, 1916; lost consciousness after this--did not know where he was\r\nuntil July 22, 1916, when he had been arrested as deserter.\r\n\r\nAdmitted to Lord Derby Hospital October 14, 1916,--quiet, orderly,\r\ncoöperative: desired to return to his regiment. He now gave a history:\r\nEnlisted British Army 1908, went to France, August, 1914, wounded\r\nFebruary, 1915, at Neuve Chapelle; recovered; then attached to 45th\r\nDurham Light Infantry; blown up July 22, 1916, came to August 5,\r\n1916, in hospital in Boulogne; then back to his regiment--but month\r\nlater left without leave to pay off old score on a former comrade\r\nwho had insulted his sister--arrested later by military police; put\r\nunder observation in 65th Field Ambulance. No deterioration noted,\r\nschool knowledge fairly well retained; no hallucinations or delusions\r\n(maintained he was a spiritualist, also that following shell-shock\r\nhad suffered from insomnia and seemed to hear sister’s voice).\r\nPhysically--small, well nourished, effeminate looking.\r\n\r\nOct. 23, 1916, he broke parole, but a month later returned to hospital\r\nunder arrest. The police reported he had been masquerading as wounded\r\nFrench soldier attached to British army as interpreter; imposed on\r\npeople; had two leaden types in his possession: “Interpreter R. le\r\nAuldere, attached to 1st Division.”\r\n\r\nStory in hospital on return:--Born in France, did well in school,\r\nentered military academy at Paris. Quarreled with father--ran away\r\nto sea. Adopted by a French lady at Pembroke Dock. On account of\r\ndrunken habits, quarreled again; joined army at Bristol, 1908. Went\r\nto France in August, 1914; January, 1915, invalided home because of\r\n“trench feet”--discharged as unfit. Reënlisted June, 1915, in Durham\r\nLight Infantry. January, 1916, again ordered to France. Blown up on\r\nSomme, July, 1916, by shell--remembered nothing until brought to No. 3\r\nGeneral Hospital. He remembers being accused of desertion but sentence\r\nwas not passed, as he was held by the medical officer to have been\r\nirresponsible (as a matter of fact he was, at that time, considered to\r\nbe a case of dementia praecox.)\r\n\r\nSaid that during twenty-five days, due to drunkenness, his friends had\r\ntaken him to Manchester with them; arrested by police as he attempted\r\nto get back to hospital. He was now accused of wilfully lying and,\r\nconfronted with his police record, at first denied it, but later gave\r\nfollowing approximately true story:\r\n\r\nBorn, England, 1890; early life of a roving disposition, good at\r\nschool, liked books of adventure. Drank early. Ran away at sixteen; was\r\nreturned home. Ran away again--convicted of drunkenness. Three-year\r\nsentence to reformatory in 1910 for stealing: escaped. Rearrested for\r\nstealing in 1911: released in 1913, enlisted in army and deserted.\r\nArrested in January, 1914, for stealing; sentenced to three years:\r\nreleased to rejoin army in June, 1915. Arrested as deserter: imprisoned\r\nbut released in January, 1916; left for France. August, 1916,\r\n“shell-shocked,” sent to Field Ambulance No. 3, General Hospital,\r\nNetley, and Lord Derby War Hospital. Court-martialed for desertion:\r\nnothing came of it on account of medical evidence.\r\n\r\nAfter breaking his hospital parole, he masqueraded in district as “R.\r\nle Auldere,” “Le Marchal” and imposed on various persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychopath almost Bolshevik.\r\n\r\n=Case 184.= (HOVEN, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant, accountant in civil life (father insane, mother pulmonary,\r\ngrandfather alcoholic, cousin insane; patient himself anemic as a\r\nboy, victim of chronic gastritis and gonorrhea), was evacuated from\r\nthe front to Chateaugiron in March, 1916. It appeared that instead\r\nof watching over his men as a sergeant should, he gave utterance to\r\nbaroque theories of the divine right, the influence of the grace of\r\nGod on man, and the end of the war. He went so far as to ask leave to\r\ntransmit to the Inventions Bureau of the War Ministry an invention\r\nwith respect to the problem of locomotion, and he sent to the King of\r\nBelgium a manuscript to the effect that he had received from heaven\r\na mission to reëstablish the world’s balance. He was, in fact, the\r\nvictim of delusions of a mystical nature with visual hallucinations. To\r\nexplain his mission, he wrote, “It was my duty to take supreme command\r\nof war operations.… I have the power, the right and the duty to give\r\nthe following order … general armistice … peace will be symbolized\r\nby the house undivided and will be constituted by general Christian\r\nreligious unity … as a consequence of what we shall say they will give\r\nup our territory to us of their own accord.”\r\n\r\nThis case of paranoia apparently took its coloring in part from the war\r\nsituation itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical mutism: Persistent delusional psychosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 185.= (DUMESNIL, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant, aged 23, evacuated from the front to a hospital for the\r\ninsane, had been mute, though not deaf, since February 28, 1915. If\r\nasked to cry out he grew black in the face and could utter only a\r\nraucous scream which made everyone jump. He wrote very frequently,\r\nstating in February that as he was still a sergeant and had no hope\r\nof advancement, he cared nothing more for life. “The idea of death\r\ngot anchored in my head.” In this state of mind, on the afternoon of\r\nthe 27th two bombs came. “I saw the first one coming and cried out\r\na warning. Coming back I saw the second one. The bombs were coming\r\nrather softly. From this moment on and up to the time when they burst,\r\nI thought I had gone, that I had been carried off and crushed. I was\r\nquite astounded at finding myself covered with earth and stones … but\r\nI could not talk any more, I could just say in a low voice ‘Papa,’ and\r\nthe next day in an ambulance I could not talk at all.”\r\n\r\nThere was complete pharyngeal anesthesia. The man had been a foundling\r\nand was clearly a degenerate. He had always been of a depressed\r\ndisposition and given to thoughts about his misfortunes. Over and\r\nabove the mutism gradually ideas of persecution and revindication\r\ndeveloped (such as that he merited adjutant’s rank and was being mocked\r\nand treated as a simulator). He drew up a long letter to the War\r\nMinistry in which he stated his desire to be sent back to the front.\r\nHe complained to the police about a hospital sergeant and offered a\r\nduel in an elaborate and inflammatory style, “with whatever weapons\r\nshall please you, either sabre of 1845, revolver of 1902 or bayonet of\r\n1886 or the _chassepot_. One of us two must disappear.” He had become\r\ndangerous enough to be interned and in hospital remained mute with the\r\nsame ideas of persecution and revindication, the same alternate phases\r\nof calmness and excitation. According to Dumesnil: hysterical mutism\r\nwith persecutory delusional psychosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA peasant’s psychopathic inferiority brought out by the war.\r\n\r\n=Case 186.= (BENNATI, October, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian peasant began to feel sick on being called to arms.\r\nAntebellum he had been an even-tempered, good-natured man, according\r\nto his own story, satisfied even with stale food, and always enjoying\r\nhis sleep. He had been in the war about a month, doing construction\r\nwork, sentry duty, and chores. Though he lived in the trenches under\r\ndamp conditions, there had really not been much excessive war strain.\r\nHe shortly developed migraine and war-weariness, as well as middle-ear\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nA number of times he heard shooting nearby, and was subject in his\r\nsentry duty to a good deal of anxiety and painful associations. On\r\nsentry duty he had digestive disorder, vomited, and became intolerably\r\nweary; in point of fact, a fever, regarded as malarial, then developed,\r\ntogether with diarrhea.\r\n\r\nUpon hospital observation, he was found fatigued, given to terrible\r\ndreams, tremulous in the fingers, with skin reflexes a little\r\nexcessive, and the Moebius phenomenon. The thyroid was somewhat\r\nswollen. The pulse stood at 80. The Mannkopf sign was well marked, as\r\nwell as that of Thomayer (80-120), and Erben (120-87). The oculocardiac\r\nreflex was prominent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychopathic episodes.\r\n\r\n=Case 187.= (PELLACANI, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA Neapolitan, 26 (neuropathic stock: mother epileptic, brother\r\npsychopathic; patient had previous criminal record; married and then\r\nappeared to behave himself for several years; had always been excitable\r\nand of violent temper), after but one severe day in the trenches, woke\r\nand found his night clothes soaked in urine. Another time, his comrade\r\nhad awakened him because he was gnashing his teeth in his sleep. Again,\r\nhis grief became very violent at learning of his wife’s infidelity, and\r\nduring the night he bit his finger. He thereafter suffered from severe\r\nheadaches, dizziness and vertigo though without falling. He was granted\r\na furlough, but the condition was aggravated on account of his wife’s\r\nabandonment of him, and one day, finding her with her lover, he threw\r\nhimself at them, wounding her severely in the face: he did not remember\r\nthis impulse later. Many hours later, on awakening in prison with his\r\nwounded hand, he recalled the entire episode. He showed a confused and\r\nexcited condition, which, however, quickly diminished. He became lucid\r\nand tranquil, though easily aroused. He cried at the thought of his\r\ndaughter, whom he wanted to save. Insomnia, instability of reaction,\r\nhabitual migraine, and dizziness. Tremors of the fingers and of the\r\neyelids. Exaggerated reflexes. Very striking cutaneous analgesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nManiacal and hysterical delinquent.\r\n\r\n=Case 188.= (BUSCAINO AND COPPOLA, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian soldier, 25, a foundling, was always off and on in a\r\nmilitary prison. At a tavern one night the man unsheathed his sword and\r\nthrew three bottles at the host. Bystanders overpowered him and carried\r\nhim to the local police station. Handcuffs were put on to stop the\r\nmania. His pupils were dilated and he was sweating profusely. Alcohol\r\ncould absolutely be excluded from the history of this incident.\r\n\r\nObserved in clinic, the patient was rather silent, but on the whole\r\nnormal and without delusions or hallucinations. It seems that he had\r\ncommitted a number of crimes in the army that were always excused on\r\naccount of his mental state. He had been strongly alcoholic, although\r\nnot at the time of the incident mentioned. He was covered with\r\ntattooings of an obscene and violent nature.\r\n\r\nHe showed pharyngeal and conjunctival anesthesia and concentric\r\nlimitation of the visual fields of unusual degree, and a remarkable\r\nhypalgesia. The knee-jerks were lively. The man was, in point of fact,\r\nsent back to military service, with, however, the suggestion of reform\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychopathic delinquent.\r\n\r\n=Case 189.= (BUSCAINO AND COPPOLA, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian, 20 (family history negative), was described by officers as\r\nof an odd disposition, at times thoughtful and again chattering and\r\npresumptuous, and often very vulgar in talk and manner. He had tried\r\nseveral trades, with little success.\r\n\r\nWhile in the army he discharged his gun three times, claiming to\r\nhave heard noises in a nearby field. On account of the inopportune\r\nrepeated discharges, he was condemned to the barracks for ten days. The\r\nfollowing day, instead of returning to the barracks, he abandoned his\r\nmusket, cartridge box and uniform, and, returning to town, left for\r\nLeghorn. Being sent to prison, he began to scream that he was thirsty.\r\nHe tore his jacket into strips with his teeth, and making a noose of\r\nit, attempted to hang himself.\r\n\r\nOn being transferred to the military hospital, he was often very\r\nrestless, screaming and making a great uproar. On being questioned,\r\nhe answered indifferently and had a vacant stare. During his stay at\r\nthe clinic, patient was always quiet. Once, however, he had a spell of\r\nintense psycho-motor agitation, brought on without any known cause and\r\nfollowed by a short period of bewilderment, lasting altogether half an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nPatient had insomnia and his visual fields showed concentric\r\ncontraction for white. He was sent to a military convalescent hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychopathic excitement.\r\n\r\n=Case 190.= (BUSCAINO AND COPPOLA, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian soldier, 22 (father and brother both committed to insane\r\nasylums), since his enlistment had been conducting himself strangely,\r\nbeing impulsive, undisciplined and unbalanced. He had been in Libia\r\nfrom January to August, 1913, and was returned to Italy on account\r\nof persistent severe headaches. A month later he was returned to a\r\nregiment in camp.\r\n\r\nSeptember 23, 1914, the patient, who had been reproved by a superior\r\nofficer to whom he had given a disrespectful answer, began to be\r\nexcitable. He was calm during the day, but acted in a sullen and gloomy\r\nway and kept entirely to himself, avoiding even his most intimate\r\nfriends. When, however, he suddenly recalled his punishment of the\r\nmorning, he began to race around the yard and finally threw himself\r\nupon the ground, remaining there in a cowering and squatting position.\r\nAt the beginning of the attack he was possessed of a paroxysm of fury,\r\nwhich made a great impression upon those present: eyes agape, face\r\nswollen and distorted. He resisted being transferred to the hospital\r\nand a furious struggle followed. He tried to bite and scratch everyone.\r\nIt required ten persons to carry him by his hands and feet safely to\r\nthe hospital, where he arrived in a state of great excitement and rage.\r\n\r\nAt the clinic, during the period of observation, he was always\r\ntranquil, rather silent, gloomy, somewhat hostile; said he did not\r\nremember why he was brought there. Often he was not able to sleep,\r\nespecially during the first few days of his stay. Has had painful\r\nheadaches and feeling of dizziness. Several times he showed a\r\ntendency to be untruthful. Bodily examination revealed the absence of\r\nconjunctival and pharyngeal reflexes. W. R. of serum was negative.\r\n\r\nPatient was sent to an interior hospital for convalescence.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesertion: Dromomania.\r\n\r\n=Case 191.= (CONSIGLIO, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian private, 19, came up for desertion in the face of the enemy.\r\nHe had had a good record during a year of military service and his army\r\nconduct in the war was regarded as very good.\r\n\r\nHe felt sad and preoccupied for a number of days, but all of a sudden\r\n“some indomitable force” thrust the idea into him to go out into the\r\ncountry a distance of some 20 kilometers from the front, with the\r\ndefinite object of praying in a certain church. It seems that this same\r\nimpulse had occurred to him several times before but not so forcibly.\r\nThese prayers were to be said in memory of some sad events in his life.\r\n\r\nUpon examination he was found in a sad and self-accusatory state, much\r\ndiscouraged with ideas of his guilt, unworthiness, and ruin. He had a\r\nvariety of gloomy fears and obsessions, all of which contributed to the\r\ndromomania that culminated in desertion.\r\n\r\nAs to his previous history, he had had a depressive psychosis two years\r\nbefore, but the delusions at that time were of persecution. He had also\r\nsuffered from typhoid fever a few weeks thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppressed homosexuality.\r\n\r\n=Case 192.= (R. P. SMITH, October, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man, 32 years, of high intellectual attainments and unblemished moral\r\ncharacter--a teacher--enlisted as a private. He apparently found his\r\nassociates in camp very uncongenial and undesirable. He grew physically\r\ntired, then mentally tired and unable to concentrate attention. He\r\nbegan to neglect his uniform, could not keep his equipment in order,\r\nbecame introspective and depressed. The drums he heard seemed to point\r\nto his funeral. There was but one thing to do in his opinion: that was\r\nto humiliate himself by committing sodomy. He thought of committing\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nUpon discharge from military duty, he began to show improvement. Smith\r\nregards this case as one of suppressed homosexuality.\r\n\r\nOf the cases in which change or excessive work is the precipitating\r\ncause, four out of six of Smith’s cases were men.\r\n\r\n_Re_ homosexuality in the Italian army, Lattes has made a special\r\nstudy. The effeminate homosexual is decidedly unfit for the army, being\r\nunable to stand the war stress. Homosexuals diminish army morale.\r\nThe cases of functional effeminacy with normal physique are likewise\r\nunfortunate for the morale of active units, though they may be employed\r\nin garrison duty and office work. The medical decision in these cases\r\nmay prove difficult unless a broad interpretation of the concept\r\n“psychopathic” is allowed to prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychopathic: suicidal, then self-mutilative.\r\n\r\n=Case 193.= (MACCURDY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn English soldier as a child had night terrors and fear of the dark;\r\nas a youth wanted to throw himself down from heights; took delight\r\nin seeing animals killed; was shy with both sexes; was never able to\r\nrun great distances; was taken from school at the age of fifteen for\r\nweakness, and had always been subject to headaches, somewhat improved\r\nby lenses.\r\n\r\nDuring training sharp pains appeared in the left groin that grew\r\nbetter when the man lay down. These pains were regarded as hysterical.\r\nThereafter began shortness of breath, pain above the heart, with\r\npalpitations and occasional attacks of dizziness. After a short sick\r\nleave he insisted upon going to the front, though his superior officer\r\nthought it unwise, and, after a period of seventeen months training,\r\nwas finally sent to France in September, 1916.\r\n\r\nHe was at first somewhat afraid of shells and, though he soon got\r\nused to the shells, the horror of the war grew on him, with pity for\r\nthe Germans as much as for the British. He became depressed over his\r\nweakness and when his commanding officer committed suicide got obsessed\r\nwith the idea of committing suicide himself. He went so far as to drive\r\na knife into his upper lip and to smash a looking-glass to avoid seeing\r\nhimself. After a long spell of trench duty he had to be sent home\r\nincapacitated.\r\n\r\nIn hospital in England he was depressed and suicidal. He began to want\r\nto mutilate himself, yet found that a slight pain and the drawing of\r\nblood was all that he really craved. Of course, he had been a failure,\r\nbut now he rationalized the failure by a comfortable conviction that\r\nhe should never have been sent to the front. He complained of memory\r\nand attention disorder, insisted that he was physically incapable of\r\noutdoor exercise, complained of headache if he stayed indoors. He said\r\nhe wanted to go back to the front; knew, however, that he could not,\r\nand even refused to consider the possibility of getting well to work\r\nat home. At the time of report he argued there was nothing left but\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\n\r\nBombardment: Psychasthenia?\r\n\r\n=Case 194.= (LAIGNEL-LAVASTINE AND COURBON, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA twenty-year old engineering student of high grade and without\r\nhereditary taint, a scientific and non-introspective man of a brilliant\r\nand gay disposition, not very religious, without special sexual\r\nabnormality, was mobilized in class 1914, was put into the artillery,\r\nand was soon appointed _maréchal des logis_. He left for the front\r\nApril, 1915, yet had to be evacuated in November. One afternoon, at the\r\nend of a bombardment, he rose from a recumbent attitude and immediately\r\nfelt a dreamy, bizarre feeling, as if a fog lay between him and his\r\nsurroundings. Next day, after a good night, he woke in the same state.\r\nEverything was bizarre and novel despite the fact that he recognized\r\nmen and things. A physician ordered rest and after a few days evacuated\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe was cared for in various hospitals, but the psychasthenia increased.\r\nHe felt a terrible and causeless anguish, with precordial constriction.\r\nHe felt as if he were about to be executed. His fears appeared after\r\nseeing some turning object, such as a wheel or a cane twirling.\r\nGradually this fear was transformed into a genital excitation, though\r\nlascivious pictures did not excite him. Seeing anything turning gave\r\nhim a voluptuous feeling in proportion to the speed of the rotation.\r\nIt seems that all sexual interest had been at a standstill for several\r\nmonths in the early part of his disease, when suddenly this new\r\naberration appeared. It seems that a portion of the man’s work in the\r\nartillery caused him to use screws and cogwheels every day. Attacks\r\nof vertigo occurred, with the appearance of an infinity of small,\r\ncolorless spheres turning over one another, the whole forming a sort\r\nof animated system of rotation. In the night this system was luminous\r\nand somewhat like what one feels on compressing the globes of the eye.\r\nThere was a retraction of the visual field. The man would be found\r\nin the dream state, especially after waking in the morning or when\r\nsome novel kind of act was being performed. He got somewhat better\r\nand did not wish to go on leave, because he feared the recurrence of\r\nthese psychasthenic paroxysms. However, he took a leave July 14th.\r\nIn the first part of his journey he had some vertigo and some of the\r\nvoluptuous sensations, but in the next two days he was much better. He\r\nreturned to hospital without trouble.\r\n\r\nThe authors somewhat doubtfully term this case one of a quiet\r\npsychasthenia, but in discussion still further talk arose as to the\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Re_ psychasthenics, Lépine notes that the lack of any out-standing\r\nsymptoms in many psychasthenics allows them to stay in the army longer\r\nthan would epileptics or hysterics of the same degree of disease. The\r\nline officers tend to consider them exaggerators or simulators. The\r\nfact that they besiege the line officers and the physicians with their\r\ntroubles may add to the impression of falsification. The basis of the\r\npsychasthenia is often also, genuinely enough, a fear. Lépine divides\r\nthe military cases into anxiety neuroses and hypochondrias. The anxiety\r\ncases are hypotensive and given to tachycardia. They have very labile\r\nvasomotors. When it comes to the necessary exclusion of malingering, it\r\nis the history, with its hereditary and collateral taint, that tells\r\nthe tale. A history in the patient himself of alcoholism, typhoid\r\nfever, syphilis, or especially cranial trauma may play a part. An\r\nagoraphobic may actually be in general a courageous man except for his\r\ncrises of anxiety about open spaces.\r\n\r\nAs to the hypochondriacs, fear of syphilis must be noted. Akin to the\r\nsyphilophobics are a group of pseudo genitourinary cases that fear\r\neffects of an old gonorrhoea. See Case 195 (Colin and Lautier) below.\r\n\r\n\r\nGonorrhoea: NOSOPHOBIA, depression, suicidal attempt. Recovery,\r\nthirteen months.\r\n\r\n=Case 195.= (COLIN and LAUTIER, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA munition worker came to Villejuif, December 6, 1915, with cord marks\r\non his neck and conjunctival ecchymoses. He had tried to hang himself.\r\n\r\nNon-alcoholic, he had, however, long since shown signs of imbalance;\r\nhis father had died insane, in an institution. When the man came in,\r\nhe wept and groaned and made vague complaints of having contracted a\r\nvenereal disease, insisting that his genital organs were purple.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days, he grew less anxious and told how he was married and\r\nhow his wife had made life a hell for him, giving herself up to drink\r\nand becoming a sloven; how several months since he had contracted\r\ngonorrhoea; how though told that the condition was cured, he had found\r\nfilaments in the urine and had tried a variety of drugs, spending most\r\nof his money; how he found more and more filaments, thought himself\r\nincurable and unable to live with his wife; how at last, desperate, he\r\nhad tried to hang himself.\r\n\r\nHe got well quickly, though his convalescence was interrupted by\r\nseveral periods of depression a few days in duration, with anxiety and\r\ntears. February, 1916, he was discharged well.\r\n\r\nHe returned four months later; he was still occupied with his disease,\r\nstill going to physicians and buying drugs. It took six months more\r\nbefore the man could be discharged from the service, at the end of 1916.\r\n\r\nThis man appears to be a hereditarily predisposed subject, who simply\r\naffixed his delusional ideas to a disease which had begun some time\r\nbefore the mental trouble itself. The family plight is important and\r\npractically constant in this group of cases. The fear lest the disease\r\nshall be revealed by the physician to the family is deep-grounded and\r\nimpossible to overcome by mere statements concerning professional\r\nsecrecy. The impulse to suicide is extraordinarily keen.\r\n\r\n\r\nA soldier (neuropathic taint) after hardships for two days stumbles\r\nover a corpse; unconsciousness: Stupor; episodes of fright with war\r\nhallucinations; look of premature old age; paresis; anesthesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 196.= (LATTES and GORIA, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian soldier (a shoemaker with an epileptic mother and two\r\nnervous brothers; himself always irritable and for long periods\r\nmelancholic; at 15 condemned to nine years in prison for homicide in\r\na quarrel) took part in a number of attacks at the beginning of the\r\nwar. His company was heavily engaged in October, 1915, and there was no\r\nsleep two nights, and only a bit of cold food. He was dazed.\r\n\r\nOctober 24, the company had to advance at night in the rain and under a\r\nheavy rifle fire. The shoemaker stumbled over a corpse, fell, and lost\r\nconsciousness for a time that he thought was very long. He woke up in a\r\ncamp hospital, remembering all the experiences he had undergone up to\r\nthe time of losing consciousness. He now fell into a state of torpor,\r\noccasionally jumping out of bed and shouting with fear, hurling himself\r\nat non-existent persons, assuming a position of defence, and suddenly\r\nawaking in anxiety.\r\n\r\nOctober 29, he was transferred to a second hospital, and October 30,\r\nin a third hospital, was examined and found well and strongly built,\r\nbut looking prematurely old. He was inactive, depressed, and stuporous\r\nlooking. He fell to weeping often and rarely gave any answer to\r\nquestions. Sometimes he refused food. There was a slight paresis of the\r\nleft arm, and the left pupil was smaller than the right; both pupils\r\nreacted poorly to light. The larynx and cornea did not respond to\r\nstimulation. Skin reflexes were poor, and the plantar reflex lacking.\r\nThe left side about the shoulder and hip showed large patches of\r\nanesthesia to touch, pain and heat; but deep sensibility was present in\r\nthese areas. He slept well at night. Status unchanged for two weeks.\r\nHe was experimentally sent to the guardhouse, but was soon back in\r\nhospital with the same symptoms as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. SHELL-SHOCK: NATURE AND CAUSES.\r\n\r\n              --la buia campagna\r\n      tremò sì forte, che dello spavento\r\n      la mente di sudore ancor mi bagna\r\n\r\n    La terra lagrimosa diede vento,\r\n      che balenò una luce vermiglia,\r\n      la qual mi vinse ciascun sentimento;\r\n\r\n    E caddi, come l’uom, cui sonno piglia.\r\n\r\n            --the dusky plain\r\n      trembled so violently, that the remembrance\r\n      of my terror bathes me still with sweat.\r\n\r\n    The tearful ground gave out wind\r\n      which flashed forth a crimson light\r\n      that conquered all my senses;\r\n\r\n    And I fell, like one who is seized with sleep.\r\n\r\n                      Inferno, Canto III, 130-136.\r\n\r\n\r\nBombardment; shell explosion nearby: Mania; death in 24 hours. The\r\nAUTOPSY showed superficial punctate hemorrhages of brain and congestion\r\nof pia mater. CAUSE OF DEATH--small bulbar hemorrhage, congestion\r\nof veins, and nerve-cell changes of a local and differential nature\r\n(chromatolysis of vago-accessorius nucleus). SHELL-SHOCK SYMPTOMS due\r\nto capillary anemia and chromatolysis of various regions.\r\n\r\n=Case 197.= (MOTT, November, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier became rather nervous at the Somme, and later underwent\r\nintense bombardment for some four hours, February 22, 4 to 8 P.M.\r\nAlthough he said he “could not stand it much longer” he carried on\r\nfor twelve hours more when perhaps six shells went over, February 23.\r\nOne of the shells burst about ten feet away, just behind the dugout.\r\nThe first day of the bombardment he was tremulous and depressed;\r\nlater coarsely tremulous in the limbs. February 23 there was crying\r\nand inability to walk or do any sort of work. Questions were not\r\nanswered. The pupils were dilated. The evening of February 23 the man\r\nwas admitted to the field ambulance in acute mania, shouting: “Keep\r\nthem back! Keep them back!” He was quieted with morphine and chloroform\r\nand slept well during the night. There were at least two hypodermic\r\ninjections of morphine in the ambulance. He woke up the morning of\r\nFebruary 24 apparently well, but suddenly died.\r\n\r\nThe autopsy showed small scratches on the anterior chest wall, but\r\notherwise no sign of external violence. Both lungs were edematous;\r\nthe left lower lobe showed a considerable hemorrhage. The heart was\r\nenlarged and the right side dilated. The liver was somewhat congested.\r\nThe kidneys were small, but otherwise showed no gross change (urine\r\nwithout sugar or albumin).\r\n\r\n                                CHART 7\r\n\r\n                   EFFECTS OF HIGH EXPLOSIVE SHELLS\r\n\r\n    EMOTIONAL\r\n\r\n    COMMOTIONAL\r\n\r\n    LESIONAL\r\n\r\n                                           After Vincent and others\r\n\r\n                                CHART 8\r\n\r\n    SHELL-SHOCK\r\n         ^\r\n         |\r\n    +----+-----------------------------+\r\n    |                                  |\r\n    |                                  |\r\n    |        SUGGESTION                |    ESSENTIAL!\r\n    |  (AUTO-, HETERO-, MEDICAL)       |    (Babinski)\r\n    |                                  |\r\n    |                                  |   SOMETIMES SOLE\r\n    |                                  |      FACTOR?\r\n    +----------------------------------+\r\n        ^            |        ^\r\n        |            |        |\r\n        |            |        |\r\n    +------------+   |    +------------+\r\n    |            |   |    |            |     INTRABELLUM\r\n    |            |   |    |            |       FACTORS\r\n    |            |   |    |            |       USUALLY\r\n    |   EMOTION  |   |    |   SHOCK    |       ONE OR\r\n    |            |   |    |            |        BOTH\r\n    |            |   |    |            |\r\n    |            |   |    |            |\r\n    +------------+   |    +------------+\r\n           ^         |          ^\r\n    -------|--------------------|----------------------------\r\n           |                    |\r\n    +------------------------------------+\r\n    |                                    |\r\n    |               SOIL                 |      FREQUENT BUT\r\n    |       (ACQUIRED, ANTEBELLUM)       |      NON-ESSENTIAL\r\n    |                                    |\r\n    +------------------------------------+\r\n                      ^\r\n                      |\r\n    ------------------|--------------------------------------\r\n                      |\r\n    +-------------------------------------+\r\n    |                                     |\r\n    |               TAINT                 |    FREQUENT BUT\r\n    |            (HEREDITARY)             |    NON-ESSENTIAL\r\n    |                                     |\r\n    +-------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe scalp showed a slight frontal bruise. The brain was extremely\r\ncongested. On each side of every superficial vessel there was an\r\necchymosis. A number of minute punctate hemorrhages was found on the\r\nsurface of the brain in connection with very small vessels. The brain\r\nsubstance was soft, but not markedly edematous. The cerebrospinal fluid\r\nwas tinged with blood. On each side of the great sinuses of the skull\r\nthere was considerable ecchymosis. This examination was made by Capt.\r\nA. Stokes, R.A.M.C., in the mobile laboratory. There were no areas\r\nof large hemorrhage anywhere in the brain substance and no smaller\r\npetechiae, except the superficial ones above noted.\r\n\r\nMicroscopically Mott confirmed the pial congestion and macroscopic\r\nsubpial hemorrhages described in the gross. He found besides congestion\r\nalso actual hemorrhage in the vascular sheaths of the corpus callosum,\r\ninternal capsule, pons and bulb. Now and then blood corpuscles were\r\nfound extravasated into the nervous tissue.\r\n\r\nThe microscopic examination showed a generalized early chromatolysis\r\nin the nerve cells of varying intensity, especially affecting the\r\nsmall cells. The Nissl granules of the larger cells were also somewhat\r\nabnormal, being smaller and packed rather loosely together.\r\n\r\nThe small cells of the bulb and pons were slightly swollen and their\r\nnuclei large and clear. As to the larger cells of the bulb and pons,\r\nthere was less evidence of this swelling and nuclear change.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mott, this chromatolysis may perhaps be regarded as a sign\r\nof loss of biochemical neuropotential. The chromatolysis indicates a\r\nrelative degree of exhaustion of the kinetoplasm. Mott assumes that\r\nthe cells of this victim of shell-shock are in a state of beginning\r\nnervous exhaustion. He remarks that the cells of the vago-accessorius\r\nnucleus show more signs of this nervous exhaustion than others. With\r\nrespect to cerebellar findings Mott remarks that the changes found are\r\nvery similar to those described by Crile in the case of an exhausted\r\nand wounded soldier. Mott correlates the mania shown on the evening of\r\nFebruary 23 with the venous congestion of the cortex, the small subpial\r\nhemorrhages and evidence of scattered arterio-capillary collapse.\r\n\r\n                HISTOPATHOLOGY OF CASE OF SHELL-SHOCK,\r\n                        BURIAL, GAS POISONING?\r\n                             (F.

Even at the seat of concussion, the fourth segment,\r\n    an external group of cells remains showing Nissl granules.\r\n    Concussion therefore does not destroy the Nissl granules.\r\n    Probably the cells of the nucleus diaphragmaticus show a\r\n    certain amount of chromatolysis because they were continually\r\n    discharging impulses along the phrenic nerves, and the few\r\n    cells that were left of the nucleus had therefore much more\r\n    work to do. (Magnification 300.)]\r\n\r\nMott suggests that the sudden death of the case may be due to a\r\nhemorrhage into a sheath of a fair-sized vessel in the median raphe\r\nof the bulb; the general venous congestion; and the almost complete\r\nchromatolysis of the vago-accessorius nucleus (adjacent hypoglossal\r\nnucleus normal).\r\n\r\nAccording to Mott, also, many Shell-shock symptoms, _e.g._, headache,\r\ngiddiness, amnesia (anterograde and retrograde), dizzy feelings, lack\r\nof power of attention, and fatigue, stupor, inertia, mental confusion,\r\nterrifying dreams, are to be explained on the basis of capillary anemia\r\nand chromatolytic changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMine explosion. Ecchymoses; no bone or visceral consequences seen at\r\nAUTOPSY (third day after explosion) except SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE and\r\nPUNCTATE HEMORRHAGES OF BRAIN.\r\n\r\n=Case 198.= (CHAVIGNY, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant in a Chasseur Battalion was in a mine explosion and\r\nentered hospital June 19, 1915, so agitated that he had to be tied to\r\nthe stretcher during transfer from the railway. There were remains\r\nof epistaxis and blood in the right ear, not proved to be due to\r\notorrhagia; blue-black ecchymoses of both eyelids; and small ecchymoses\r\nof the bulbar conjunctiva of the right eye. No other sign of trauma\r\nor fracture. The explosion had probably taken place on June 17 or\r\n18. Patient was but semiconscious and irresponsive; rolled upon the\r\nmattress, beating the air with arms and legs, assuming fighting\r\npostures and uttering cries. Urinary incontinence. No fever.\r\n\r\nThere was doubt as to the diagnosis, which lay between fracture and\r\nconcussion. The persistent agitation and oniric delirium pointed rather\r\nto concussion. Without further sign, however, the patient died on the\r\nnight of June 20.\r\n\r\nThe autopsy was extremely careful and showed no sign of cranial\r\nfracture of vault or base. The cerebrospinal fluid was strongly\r\nbloodstained. The inner surface of the dura mater had a thin sheet\r\nof hemorrhage, hardly 1 mm. thick, covering both hemispheres and the\r\ncerebellum and spreading over the bulb. There was no distension of the\r\nlateral ventricles. Serial sections of the brain showed no lesions of\r\nthe substance, except for slight hemorrhagic points.\r\n\r\nAccording to Chavigny, so slight a meningeal hemorrhage is incapable\r\nof producing a mechanical disturbance of the brain and the cause of\r\ndeath could not be said to be meningeal hemorrhage. Massive multiple\r\ngas embolism through sudden decompression is not a suitable explanation\r\nof a case with death delayed, as in this instance, even if Arnoux’s\r\nexplanation is suitable for cases of immediate death.\r\n\r\n\r\nMine explosion: no skin, bone, or visceral consequences seen at AUTOPSY\r\n(death in seven days) except slight LOCALIZED MENINGEAL HEMORRHAGE.\r\n\r\n=Case 199.= (ROUSSY AND BOISSEAU, August, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier entered Val-de-Grâce February 27, 1915, in a state\r\nof confusion following mine explosion the night before. He was\r\ndelirious, thought himself on leave, and had spells of excitement.\r\nLumbar puncture, February 29, showed a slightly darkened fluid, with\r\napproximately normal amount of albumin, one or two lymphocytes and rare\r\nred blood cells.\r\n\r\nA brief period of slight improvement followed, but the restlessness\r\nand delirium increased once more, became particularly severe March 3,\r\nand the patient died on the night of the third, seven days after the\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nThe autopsy showed slightly congested lungs; no other lesion except a\r\nsharply defined hemorrhage in the cervical spinal meninges and over the\r\nmeninges of the temporal and occipital lobes. Microscopic section of\r\nthe brain failed to show any hemorrhages within the brain substance.\r\n\r\nHere is a case of death following explosion without external wound.\r\nThe meningeal hemorrhages are hardly enough to explain the death. The\r\nexplanation of the death must probably be made after histological\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nConcussion of spinal cord from shell burst--WITHOUT spinal fracture,\r\nWITHOUT penetration of splinters of shell or bone into canal or cord\r\nsubstance: Microscopic demonstration of intraspinal AREAS OF SOFTENING\r\nwith classical secondary degenerations. Such a case forms a link in the\r\nargument that serious lesions of the nervous system may develop as a\r\nresult of VIOLENCE directly TRANSMITTED through investing tissues EN\r\nBLOC.\r\n\r\n=Case 200.= (CLAUDE and LHERMITTE, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man, 23, was struck in the left thorax and shoulder, in both thighs\r\nand the neck, by fragments from a bursting shell March 27, 1915. One\r\nfragment was imbedded near the vertebral column.\r\n\r\nTwenty days later there was an absolute, flaccid paraplegia, yet\r\nthe legs occasionally gave spontaneous, jerky movements. Tactile\r\nanesthesia reached the fourth dorsal root-level, except that the\r\nperineoscrotal region and the penis were somewhat sensitive. There was\r\nanesthesia to pain and heat, as well as in bones and joints, along\r\nwith the tactile anesthesia. There was a hyperesthetic region on the\r\nright side, corresponding with the distribution of the fourth dorsal\r\nroot. All the cutaneous reflexes up to the abdominals were gone; but\r\ndefense reflexes could be brought out in foot and leg by skin, bone\r\nor joint stimulation. The deep reflexes of the legs were also lost,\r\nwhereas those of the arms were increased. Retention of urine without\r\nincontinence; no retention of feces. Sacral, trochanteric and heel\r\ndecubitus had developed in the course of the three weeks following\r\ninjury. A lymphangitis ran all the way up the right thigh from one of\r\nthe sores, with a corresponding hyperpyrexia.\r\n\r\nSurgical intervention was indicated from the evidence of spinal\r\ncompression at a definite level, but the lymphangitis grew worse.\r\nOniric delirium, and finally a stuporous state, set in, with death May\r\n6, forty days after the wound, a death due to septicemia, without\r\nspecial alteration in the paraplegia itself or in the sensory and\r\nreflex situation.\r\n\r\nAt autopsy the spine and dura mater proved normal; but microscopically\r\nserial sections through the fourth and fifth dorsal segments showed\r\nsoftening of the right anterior horn and posterior columns, with\r\ncavitation in the radicular zones, and the white matter of the fifth\r\ndorsal segment was in a state of acute degeneration. There were also\r\nependymal changes, namely, at the fifth dorsal level a dilatation with\r\ndeposit of albumin; in the lumbar region, breakage of the ependymal\r\nwall, with cellular gliosis. The dilated ependyma was surrounded by\r\nan area of fibrillary gliosis which had proliferated in the form\r\nof a septum in the interior of the canal. (According to Claude and\r\nLhermitte, these data concerning hydromyelia, which they regard as\r\nsecondary to trauma, are an argument in favor of the traumatic origin\r\nof certain syringomyelias. They regard the breakage of the ependymal\r\nwall as due to hypertension of the spinal fluid due to mechanical\r\nlesions.) Their interpretation of such acute degeneration as was found\r\nin the fifth segment is that this degeneration, as well as that of the\r\nposterior roots, is due to the direct impact of the cerebrospinal fluid\r\nupon the cord structure. As for the softenings with cavitation, they\r\nregard them as surely due to spinal concussion and as very possibly due\r\nto an ischemic necrosis, suggesting that older work by Duret and Michel\r\non concussion of the brain indicates the possibility of a temporary\r\nischemia of the spinal cord from the violent impact of the spinal\r\nfluid upon the cord due to shock of the spinal column. The transient\r\nhypertension of the spinal fluid might well induce, they believe, a\r\nvascular spasm with anemia, to which the gray matter is well known to\r\nbe especially sensitive. In the present case, a period of somewhat less\r\nthan six weeks had sufficed to produce secondary degenerations above\r\nand below the fifth dorsal segment, of a quite classical sort.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we here deal with a severe form of spinal concussion due\r\nto a shellburst, in which intraspinal lesions were produced without\r\nspinal fracture or penetration either of bone or of shell fragments\r\ninto the spinal cord or the spinal fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion (1 meter distant) kills a soldier by bursting both\r\nlungs within the intact thoracic cage.\r\n\r\n=Case 201.= (SENCERT, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man of the 26th Regiment of Infantry was brought October 26, 1914,\r\nto Ambulance No. 6 of the Twentieth Army Corps at the Chateau d’Henu.\r\nWeakly and jerkily the man was able to tell how, as he was going\r\nforward, a large calibre shell fell less than a meter in front of him\r\nand exploded. He fell back and lost consciousness, was picked up in the\r\nevening and carried to the relief post and then to the ambulance, where\r\nhe arrived ten hours after the fall. There were signs of a considerable\r\nshakeup, with pale and anxious face, nose pinched, hollow eyes, rapid\r\nsuperficial respiration, small pulse, 120, and a feeble voice. There\r\nwere small skin wounds of the right arm, a finger, and ear, but there\r\nwas otherwise no wound. The thorax and abdomen were somewhat painful\r\nall over, but there was no especial point of pain. The chest showed\r\na slight dulness at the bases. Examination of the abdomen produced\r\ndefensive movements and the man vomited blood during examination. He\r\nwas put on his back, kept warm, given artificial serum, hypodermic\r\ninjections of camphorated oil and caffeine, and carefully watched. In\r\nthe night he had another bloody vomiting, his pulse became smaller and\r\nsmaller, dyspnea became more and more intense, and he died late in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe autopsy showed that the abdomen was free of lesions and that all\r\nthe organs were of a normal appearance and color. There was no sign\r\nof perforation or of peritonitis. The stomach itself was filled with\r\nblood and there was a generalized ecchymotic appearance of the mucosa,\r\nwith small, submucous hematomata and a number of tears in the pyloric\r\nportion.\r\n\r\nThe pleurae were found filled with blood, almost a quart in each\r\ncavity. The right lung showed a large tear at the level of the middle\r\nlobe, 15 cm. long. An orange-size, black bit of lung protruded through\r\nthe tear. There was no sign of rib fracture opposite this tear, and no\r\nsubpleural, intercostal or subcutaneous contusion. The thorax wall was\r\nperfectly normal.\r\n\r\nThe left lung showed, in the middle portion of the upper lobe, a\r\nsomewhat analogous pleural tear, almost as big as that on the right,\r\nwith another large hernia of black lung. Bits of the herniated lung\r\nsank in water. The thorax wall was intact. The pericardium was free\r\nfrom blood. There was nothing else abnormal about the body.\r\n\r\n_Re_ effects of an explosion upon structures with intervening objects\r\nleft intact, Fauntleroy notes that a shell bursting three yards from\r\nan aneroid barometer may force its levers into an abnormal position.\r\nA further fact will indicate how permanent is the physical state into\r\nwhich the levers are forced; for when the barometer with its levers\r\nplaced right was placed under a bell-jar and the pressure therein was\r\nreduced to 410 mm., the levers resumed the position into which the\r\nexplosion of the big shell had thrown them.\r\n\r\n_Re_ windage and internal effects in the human body, Ravaut recalls the\r\nfact that the internal and intraneural hemorrhages of Caisson disease\r\n(“bends”) are well known. The external hemorrhages of aeronauts and\r\nmountain climbers belong in the same physical class. Dynamite exploded\r\nin a pond kills fish. Dynamite may break pillars inside a building\r\nwithout damaging its front. Cases like Chavigny’s (198), Roussy and\r\nBoisseau’s (199), Claude and Lhermitte’s (200), as well as Ravaut’s own\r\ncase (202) are in point.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion near by: Paraplegia, interpreted as due to windage. Two\r\nfoci of HEMORRHAGE (SPINAL CANAL, BLADDER) clinically proved to exist\r\nin a case without external sign of injury.\r\n\r\n=Case 202.= (RAVAUT, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn infantry sergeant was brought to the ambulance, one day in November,\r\n1914, with a paralysis which had set in immediately upon the explosion\r\nof a large shell a short distance away. Both legs were paralyzed and\r\nthere was anesthesia to the navel. He could not urinate. It was early\r\nin the war, and Ravaut thought he would find an injury to the vertebral\r\ncolumn, but on undressing the soldier there was no wound. The skin was\r\nintact, and there was not even an ecchymosis. The patient was suffering\r\nnot at all, but said that after the shell exploded he felt a forcible\r\nshock, was stunned for a moment, and when he wanted to rise, found\r\nthat his legs were inert. His state did not change during the day and\r\nhe did not urinate. Catheterization showed a urine full of blood. This\r\nindicated a lumbar puncture, and a bloody fluid emerged under great\r\npressure. Thus two foci of hemorrhage were proven to exist in this\r\npatient despite the fact that there was no external lesion.\r\n\r\n_Re_ windage effects, see suggestions of Ravaut under Case 201. Ravaut\r\nalso suggests that certain cases of emotional jaundice may be similarly\r\nexplained on the basis of internal lesion due to windage. Sundry cases\r\nof gastro-intestinal disorder and of hemoptysis fall into the same\r\nclass; possibly the cases of death in a fixed posture belong there,\r\ntoo. Ravaut thinks, despite the look of hysteria about the shell-shock\r\ncases of paraplegia, deafness, mutism, and the like, that the cases\r\nare actually ones in which there has been at the beginning a slight or\r\nsevere hemorrhage, clearing up in a few days. He states that there is a\r\npretty definite parallelism between the course of the clinical symptoms\r\nand the chemical characteristics of the spinal fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion in confined space; paraplegia after fifteen minutes;\r\nslight hemorrhage and LYMPHOCYTOSIS of spinal fluid; Hematomyelia.\r\n\r\n=Case 203.= (FROMENT, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Sergeant lying down in a small dugout space, 2 × 1 m. high, had a\r\n77 shell burst behind his head and between his head and the back of\r\nthe dugout. The patient was not moved by the explosion, but was buried\r\nin a small amount of earth and stones to a depth of about 20 cm. He\r\nwas not wounded and showed no ecchymoses either then or later. Aided\r\nby stretcher bearers, he was able to walk to the relief post about\r\n400 meters from the trench. He did not lose consciousness, and got\r\nto the relief post about a quarter of an hour after the shell burst.\r\nThereafter, however, he was unable to move his legs. The accident\r\nhappened February 6 at 4 o’clock. He was examined 24 hours after the\r\ntrauma. The accompanying diagrams show the variations in sensory\r\ndisorder at intervals during six months.\r\n\r\nA lumbar puncture, February 8, 1915, showed hypertensive clear fluid\r\nwithout macroscopic clot on centrifuging, but showing a number of red\r\nblood cells and lymphocytes--3 or 4 to the microscopic field. There\r\nwas a slight hyperalbuminosis. The development of the muscular atrophy\r\nand hypo-excitability of the left lower extremity, the exaggeration of\r\nthe left knee-jerk, together with the spinal fluid appearances, seemed\r\nto prove the organic nature of the paraplegia. There was an intense\r\nrhachialgia, with radiation along the sciatic nerve. This outlasted\r\nall other symptoms. Thermo-analgesia was the most prominent sensory\r\ndisorder. There were no sphincter disorders.\r\n\r\nDuring the first days, the anesthesia was of a pure segmentary type,\r\nwith nothing about it to suggest that it was later to be supplanted\r\nby a radicular type of disorder. Hematomyelia was, years ago,\r\nthought--according to Froment--to tend to yield sensory disorders\r\nof a segmentary nature. At the outset this anesthesia was total,\r\nthough there was a vague, poorly localized feeling on intense\r\npainful excitations,--as with energetic pricking or burning. Thus the\r\nprotopathic sensibility of Head had remained, whereas the epicritic\r\nsensibility had disappeared.\r\n\r\nDetailed examination of this case showed extreme errors in the position\r\nsense. For example, pricking the foot might be localized as pinching\r\nabove the knee. The cremaster reflex was extremely marked and would\r\nappear upon even slight excitation of any part of the lower extremity,\r\neven at times when the patient declared he felt nothing. These\r\nphenomena at the beginning early gave place to a syringomyelic type of\r\nanesthesia.\r\n\r\nAt the time of report, July 29, 1915, Froment regarded this case as\r\nanalogous to hematomyelias of divers, although there is not such a\r\ndegree of decompression; the suddenness of the decompression is more\r\nmarked in these Shell-shock cases than in divers.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion; bowled over; loss of consciousness: Hemiplegia\r\nwith reflex signs thought to be organic; hypertensive spinal fluid;\r\nLYMPHOCYTOSIS.\r\n\r\n=Case 204.= (GUILLAIN, August, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA corporal in the engineers was going the night of June 7th to a\r\ncreneau of mitrailleuses, when he was bowled over by a bursting\r\nshell. He lost consciousness and was carried to the cantonment by\r\nhis comrades. Next morning he complained of headache and pain in the\r\nback; had a convulsion; and proved on examination to have a left-sided\r\nhemiplegia. He was given the diagnosis of hysterical hemiplegia.\r\n\r\nHe was sent to the 6th Army neurological center, and there showed a\r\ncomplete left-sided hemiplegia with tendency to contracture. The left\r\nknee-jerk and arm reflexes were exaggerated, and there was ankle and\r\npatella clonus with Babinski sign. There was a dysesthesia on the\r\nleft side, with wrong interpretation and poor localization of painful\r\nstimuli, and non-recognition of cold and heat sensations. Muscle sense\r\nand stereognosis were impaired. There was a slight dysarthria. Lumbar\r\npuncture yielded a clear hypertensive fluid with a slight lymphocytosis.\r\n\r\nThe situation remained without change for a month, when the patient\r\nwas evacuated to the rear. Thus, a shell-burst can produce destructive\r\nnerve lesions without evidence of external injury.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hypertensive spinal fluid, Sollier and Chartier cite Dejerine as\r\nhaving brought the proof of hypertension in the cerebrospinal fluid in\r\nShell-shock cases. They also believe that the Shell-shock hysteria is\r\nbuilt up on a physical basis, more or less after the model of Charcot’s\r\nhysterotraumatism. Shock, windage, and gas may bring about the same\r\nkind of result. They rely especially on the cases of Sencert (201)\r\nand Ravaut (202) for their argument (1915). They recall the fact that\r\nCharcot found a hysteria due to lightning stroke and to high tension\r\nelectric accidents. They quote Lermoyez as attributing like results in\r\near cases to labyrinthine shock, tympanic rupture, and ear hemorrhages.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Hemiparesis, amnesia. Lumbar punctures early (but here as\r\nlate as one month after shock and after disappearance of hemiparesis)\r\nshowed PLEOCYTOSIS and hyperalbuminosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 205.= (SOUQUES, MEGEVAND and DONNET, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA French sergeant, a machine gunner, was the victim of shell-burst\r\nSeptember 25, 1915, was evacuated with a diagnosis of commotio cerebri,\r\nand, when examined at Paul-Brousse October 5, showed a right-sided\r\nhemiparesis, clouding of consciousness and somnolence, the hemiparesis\r\ninvolving the face, with deviation of tongue to right, Babinski reflex\r\nright, cremasteric and abdominal reflexes abolished on right. Normal\r\nrespiration and pulse.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture October 7, that is, thirteen days after the injury,\r\nyielded a clear fluid with an excess of albumin, 144 small lymphocytes\r\n(some degenerate) and a single endothelial cell.\r\n\r\nOctober 12, the knee-jerk was a little less lively on the right side.\r\nThe plantar reflex varied between extension and flexion on the right\r\nside. The cremasteric reflex had been weakly regained on the right side.\r\n\r\nThe patient was now less stupid and could tell how he jumped when\r\nthe shell burst, and how he had been in the air ten minutes (!) and\r\nfell, getting up at once, with nothing wrong except nosebleed. After a\r\nhalf-hour he felt weaker and was ordered to leave the post, whereupon,\r\non the road, his weakness increased and he tended to fall to the right,\r\nbut reached the ambulance on foot.\r\n\r\nOctober 23, there was no longer any evidence of hemiparesis, the\r\nBabinski reflex had entirely disappeared; there was no complaint except\r\nof dizziness and headaches. He got back his autocritique on the matter\r\nof remaining in the air ten minutes, but there was still an amnesia for\r\nthe ten day period between the shock and his arrival at Paul-Brousse.\r\nHe forgot that he had had a lumbar puncture October 7.\r\n\r\nAnother puncture, October 25, yielded some 14 or 15 lymphocytes to the\r\ncmm. There was still an excess of albumin. The lymphocytes decreased\r\nfurther according to a puncture November 2. Had this patient been\r\nexamined some weeks after the shock there would have been no signs of\r\nan organic paresis, no special modification of the spinal fluid, and no\r\nreason for regarding the man as other than an hysteric. Early spinal\r\npuncture is, accordingly, important.\r\n\r\nOf course, the question whether the lymphocytes and hyperalbuminosis\r\nof the fluid might not be syphilitic must be raised. At the Hospital\r\nMedical Society meeting, October 29, 1915, Souques states that\r\nRavaut and Guillain believe that simple shell-shock often produces\r\n“syphilitic” chemical, physical or cytological changes in the spinal\r\nfluid. Roussy is cited as thinking such changes rare.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; burial: Coma and semicoma; BLOOD-STAINED SPINAL FLUID.\r\nImprovement on puncture. Persistent astasia abasia with spasticity.\r\n\r\n=Case 206.= (LERICHE, September, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man was buried March 15, 1915, following the bursting of a large\r\ncalibre shell. He is said to have had hemoptysis and arrived at\r\nhospital March 17 in coma. He kept moaning while asleep. March 18, he\r\nwas still stupid and as if stunned. He did not talk or understand what\r\nwas said, but was able to write a few words. The knee-jerks were a\r\nlittle exaggerated. There was a slight spasticity of the limbs, which\r\nwas exaggerated on emotion into a sort of spasmodic crisis.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture gave a reddish fluid under strong tension. After lumbar\r\npuncture the man came out of coma and the next day, after another\r\npuncture (fluid slightly yellowish), there was further improvement and\r\nthe patient spoke. The third puncture, March 20, yielded yellow fluid.\r\nThe spastic phenomena still persisted, however. The patient could not\r\nwalk or stand. Every time he touched the ground he had a clonic crisis.\r\nHe was evacuated to a neurological center.\r\n\r\n_Re_ astasia-abasia, Nonne found these cases heading a group of 63\r\ncases of war hysteria treated in a twelvemonth. Figures as follows:\r\n\r\n    Astasia-abasia                   14\r\n    Generalized tremor               12\r\n    Brachial monoplegia              11\r\n    Isolated contracture              6\r\n    Crural paraplegia                 5\r\n    Mutism                            5\r\n    Isolated tic                      4\r\n    Hemiplegia                        3\r\n    Isolated respiratory convulsions  2\r\n    Isolated sensory disorder         1\r\n\r\nFifty-one of the 63 cases were freed by therapy from their main\r\nsymptoms (twenty-eight cases cured in one or two hypnotic sittings).\r\n\r\n\r\nProlonged bombardment; shell explosion (nearby?): Depression; suicidal\r\nattempt; hypertensive spinal fluid.\r\n\r\n=Case 207.= (LERICHE, September, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA patient entered an evacuation hospital June 27, having come from\r\nan ambulance with a ticket reading, “Melancholic depression, with\r\nstupor--attempt at suicide (threw himself into a pond)--sprained\r\nankle--to be evacuated, lying down, on a milk diet.” The patient was\r\ndepressed, indifferent to surroundings, irresponsive, and did not even\r\nlook at an interlocutor. There was no other somatic sign except a pulse\r\nof 62. He did not eat, and remained lying down, without movement.\r\nLumbar puncture in a sitting posture yielded a clear liquid under\r\npressure of 34. June 30, another lumbar puncture yielded clear fluid of\r\na dichroic appearance when looked at from above. 25 c.c. were removed.\r\nJuly 1, there had been a good deal of improvement. The patient said he\r\nwas better and began to take a little milk. July 2, there was still\r\nsome improvement. Pulse 60. He said that his condition had lasted a\r\nmonth and that it followed a violent and prolonged bombardment for ten\r\ndays in his sector. July 3, he was much better, began to look about,\r\ntalk, and eat a little. July 4, lumbar puncture yielded a clear fluid\r\nwith a pressure of 30, reduced to 22 after withdrawal of 20 c.c.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leriche, explosion of large calibre shells or of a mine\r\ncan produce cerebral or spinal symptoms, some of which are removed\r\nby lumbar puncture. The fluid is red shortly after the explosion and\r\nunder hypertension for some days. Such hypertension may be found even\r\nin shell cases that have no other sign of cerebral condition. This\r\nparticular melancholy patient had a relapse and another depression with\r\nfugue.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of HEMATOMYELIA, indirect result of bullet wound. Partial\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 208.= (MENDELSSOHN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn infantry subaltern, 23 years old, was injured September 24, 1914,\r\nby a rifle bullet, which entered above the left clavicle and emerged\r\nbetween the right scapula and the vertebral column. The patient\r\nleaped into the air when he was struck, but fell at once and found\r\nthat his legs were paralyzed. A feeling of cold crept up from the\r\nfeet to the region of the umbilicus. Consciousness was preserved.\r\nThere was hemoptysis because of the bullet’s passing through the left\r\nlung. The wounds all healed quickly. There was retention, followed by\r\nincontinence, of urine and feces; and the situation was complicated by\r\neschars in the gluteal and trochanteric region.\r\n\r\nFor three months there was no change in the paraplegia, except that at\r\nthe beginning of the third month the patient could move his fingers a\r\nlittle and raise his knees slightly. He was transferred back through\r\nthree hospital units, with a diagnosis of spinal cord lesion or\r\nfracture due to a vertebral column lesion at the second and third\r\ndorsal vertebrae.\r\n\r\nSeven months after injury, he reached a Russian hospital for a\r\nlaminectomy, incapable of standing or walking without support,\r\nalthough able to sit and rise with extreme difficulty. He could now\r\nvery slightly flex and extend the knees, and very slightly flex and\r\nrotate the ankle, and weakly move the toes. Passive movements could be\r\ncarried out without much difficulty, though there was a slight joint\r\nand muscle stiffness. Both quadriceps muscles were markedly atrophied.\r\nThere was slight amyotrophy of the lower legs. Tendon reflexes were\r\nexaggerated, and there was a marked ankle clonus, a Babinski reflex,\r\nand an abolition of the abdominal and cremasteric reflexes.\r\n\r\nThere was a sensory disorder of an incomplete syringomyelic pattern,\r\nwith diminished sensibility to heat and complete abolition of pain\r\nsensibility. Touch and electric sensations were somewhat delayed.\r\nThere was a diminution in the faradic and galvanic excitability of\r\nthe legs and feet; vasomotor disturbance (slight hyperidrosis) of\r\nthe paralyzed limbs. Two of the eschars had not yet cicatrized. The\r\nsphincteric disturbances had diminished. For the rest the patient\r\nwas normal. The second and third vertebrae showed deformity and were\r\npainful to pressure and percussion of spinous processes.\r\n\r\nThe patient was treated by galvanization of the spine, with a current\r\ndescending at first and then ascending, and by faradization of the\r\nparalyzed muscles. There was progressive improvement, irregular but\r\nconstant. At the time of report, July 1, 1915, he was perfectly well,\r\nable to take long walks, and without sphincter or sensory disturbance.\r\nThe tendon reflexes were still exaggerated, and there was still a\r\nslight ankle clonus and Babinski. The abdominal and cremasteric\r\nreflexes were still abolished. The last of the seven eschars had not\r\nyet healed over.\r\n\r\nFor the organic nature of this lesion, the numerous early eschars, the\r\npersistent sphincter disturbances, the limited paresis of the legs,\r\nthe reflex disorders, and the dissociation of sensations seem abundant\r\nevidence. It is probable that there was no fracture of the vertebrae\r\n(X-ray confirmation), and it is probable that there was a meningeal\r\nhemorrhage, together with some hemorrhagic foci in the spinal cord\r\nsubstance, especially in the gray matter. A good deal remains doubtful:\r\nMendelssohn remarks that the sphincter disturbances ought to be related\r\nto disorder of the fourth and fifth sacral segments, and the knee-jerk\r\nand Achilles jerk absence with disorder of the lower lumbar, and sacral\r\nregion; the abdominal reflex disorder with the low thoracic lesion;\r\nthe distribution of the anesthesia ought to indicate a lesion in the\r\nlower part of the spinal cord. Was not the hemorrhage therefore lower\r\ndown than the spot where the vertebrae were displaced? It is surely of\r\nprognostic note that the eschars did not necessarily foretell a fatal\r\noutcome; in fact, the patient had become functionally well before the\r\nseventh eschar was healed over.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion with subject lying down applied to machine-gun; no\r\ncontusion: HEMATOMYELIA. Partial recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 209.= (BABINSKI, June, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA veterinary student, six months captive in Germany, wrote out for\r\nBabinski the following:\r\n\r\n    “September 1, 1914, I was about to operate a machine gun when\r\n    a shrapnel shell exploded very near me,--probably about two or\r\n    three metres overhead. I base this estimate on comparisons made\r\n    with shells I saw exploded beside me before this one.\r\n\r\n    “Just after the explosion, which deafened me and at the same\r\n    time took my breath away a little, from the powder, I felt a\r\n    rather severe pain in the kidney region,--a pain which then\r\n    persisted without interruption. I moved my left arm, to find\r\n    the effect produced by a bullet which I heard whistle by my ear\r\n    and which struck the upper part of the left shoulder without\r\n    entering. At the same time, I tried to turn to see what had\r\n    become of my legs, and had a feeling that they had vanished.\r\n    Almost immediately I felt little prickings, not very painful,\r\n    in the lumbar region and in the upper part of the thighs. Just\r\n    then, seeing my comrades going away I tried to imitate them,\r\n    but could not. All these feelings passed very rapidly.\r\n\r\n    “A comrade then came near to tell me to go back. I told him\r\n    that I could not move and that I must have been wounded in the\r\n    lumbar region. He looked at my kit and my coat and said there\r\n    was no trace of shot or tear. Not wanting to leave me, he\r\n    lifted me by the armpits and knees. I could not help him get\r\n    me up, and my legs hung flexed and inert. After a few steps he\r\n    had to put me down, and tried to stand me up. I immediately\r\n    crumpled. I had no sensation of my feet touching the ground. I\r\n    sent my comrade back, asking him to tell my brother, who was\r\n    in my squad. I did not lose consciousness or any feeling of my\r\n    situation, or of the danger being run by my comrade.”\r\n\r\nThe man remained four days on the battle field without food. He\r\nwas on the edge of a stream. He did not defecate, nor for two days\r\ndid he urinate. Eventually the bladder and rectal functions were\r\nre-established, though they remained irregular. Catheterization was\r\nnever resorted to. The lumbar pains were diffuse, fixing themselves a\r\nfew days after the accident in the region below the umbilicus. There\r\nwere pains at the waist predominating on the left side. The paralysis\r\nof the lower extremities grew rapidly better. Movements in the right\r\nleg reappeared, and 27 days after the accident the man was able to\r\nstand and walk around his bed. Still further movement followed (left\r\nleg weaker).\r\n\r\nAt the time of the report, May 28, 1915, the patient could walk without\r\na cane, but he could get about only slowly. The left toes would rub\r\nagainst the ground, and he could not support himself for any length of\r\ntime on his legs. The knee-jerks were exaggerated, especially the left.\r\nThe Achilles jerks were increased. There was a Babinski reflex on the\r\nleft side and an abduction of the fifth toe on plantar stimulation. The\r\nsame reflexes were found on the right side, but less marked. Abdominal\r\nreflexes absent, except the right superior reflex, which was distinctly\r\npresent. Cremasteric reflexes absent. Anal reflexes preserved. The\r\ndefense reflexes were exaggerated, but more markedly on the left side.\r\nThe zone from which the defense reflexes could be elicited on the left\r\nside included the whole lower extremity and rose as far as 2 or 3 cm.\r\nabove the nipple. Stimulation of the lateral parts of the left lower\r\nextremity would even produce defense reflex movements on both sides\r\nof the body. On the right side, however, the defense reflex movements\r\ncould only be tried out by scratching the anterior surface of the\r\nankle, which was then followed by a flexion of the foot.\r\n\r\nSensibility to touch and deep sensibility were preserved; but\r\nsensibility to temperature and pain, normal on the left,--_i.e._,\r\nparalyzed--side, was weak in the right leg. There was a marked sudation\r\non the left side, limited by the white line, the inguinal fold, the\r\niliac spines, and a horizontal line passing through the umbilicus.\r\n\r\nHere, then, paralysis followed a shell explosion while the subject was\r\nlying down. No contusion therefore was possible. According to Babinski,\r\nwe are dealing probably with a hematomyelia, the result of shell\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\n\r\nStruck by missile in back; unconsciousness; no wound: Hysterical\r\nparaplegia? HERPES and SEGMENTARY Hyperalgesia suggest radicular and\r\nspinal injury. Recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 210.= (ELLIOT, December, 1914.)\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 1914, a sergeant in the 20th Hussars, with other dismounted\r\ncavalrymen, was chasing Germans with a bayonet, over turnip fields\r\npitted by shells. Several hours later, he found himself in a house in\r\na nearby village, to which he had been carried unconscious. Probably\r\nhe had been struck by some missile in the back, as the bottom of his\r\nhaversack had been torn off. His face was blackened with smoke, and his\r\nclothes were muddy. He had no wound. His left arm was weak and his legs\r\npowerless and numb. The passing of water was painful, but there was no\r\nblood in the water and no hemoptysis.\r\n\r\nFive days later, he was examined at a base hospital and found to be\r\nparalyzed and numb in the legs. The knee-jerk and ankle-jerk were\r\nretained upon the right side only. Pain occurred on passive movements\r\nof the legs, which were flaccid; there was a hyperalgesia about\r\nPoupart’s ligament, more marked on the left side. Lower abdominal\r\nreflexes were weak on the left side; pain in lower abdomen with bladder\r\nfull and at outset of micturition. Pain and paresis also affected the\r\nleft arm, but there was no numbness. Pain on pressure over lumbar and\r\ncervical vertebral spines. There was no evidence of bruising.\r\n\r\nThe physicians were inclined to regard the phenomena as hysterical.\r\nThree days later, the arm movements became much freer, and after\r\nanother three days, the arm movements were fairly powerful, and the\r\nlegs much stronger, although the patient could not yet stand or walk.\r\nHe still had pain if his bladder was full.\r\n\r\n                                CHART 9\r\n\r\n                         CAUSES OF SHELL-SHOCK\r\n\r\n    HEAD INJURY\r\n\r\n    ATMOSPHERIC CONCUSSION\r\n\r\n    MENTAL STRAIN\r\n\r\n    NON-NERVOUS TRAUMA\r\n\r\n    NEUROPATHIC HEREDITY\r\n\r\n                                                      After Ballard\r\n\r\nAs against the diagnosis of hysteria, three herpetic clusters appeared\r\non the skin of the left thigh, from three to six inches above the\r\nknee. Elliot regards it as certain that the posterior root ganglia\r\nwere injured. He regards the case as one of injury to the spinal nerve\r\nroots. The hyperalgesia about the body of course suggested damage to\r\nthe spinal cord. According to Elliot, therefore, this case is one of\r\norganic disease; whether of the roots or of the cord was uncertain. At\r\nany rate the cases of this type, though not functional, recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nMine-explosion; burial; labyrinthine lesions and head bruises, more\r\nmarked on left side: Focal canities (WHITE HAIR developing OVERNIGHT)\r\non left side.\r\n\r\n=Case 211.= (LEBAR, June, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 23, in the Argonne was blown up by a mine in a trench, fell,\r\nand was covered by a mass of earth, from which he extricated himself.\r\nHe immediately became deaf from what was medically determined to be a\r\ndouble hemorrhagic labyrinthitis. There were also superficial powder\r\nburns of the face, as well as several bruises on the head, especially\r\non the left side.\r\n\r\nThe next day, at the English hospital at Arc-en-Barrois, the patient\r\nnoticed tufts of white hair on the left side of the head. There were\r\nfour islets of gray hair in the left fronto-parieto-occipital region,\r\nseparated from one another by normal hairs. The gray hairs were gray\r\ncompletely from the roots to the ends of the hair. The longest hairs\r\nwere as white as the shortest. There was not a brown hair amongst them.\r\nThe gray hairs were solidly implanted, and could be pulled out only by\r\nstrong traction. There was a discoloration also of the bulbar swelling\r\nof the hair. The rest of the head hair was dark brown. His hair was\r\ndescribed in the military description: “deep chestnut brown.” There was\r\nno other symptom aside from an incessant twitching of the left eyelids.\r\nThe place of whitening was apparently determined by the region of the\r\nscalp injured. Not only were the bruises on the left side of the head\r\nand face, but the labyrinthine lesions were more marked on this side\r\nand the twitching of the eye-lids was confined to the left side.\r\n\r\n\r\nShrapnel wound of skull; focal canities over wound; shell-shock and\r\nshrapnel wound of right leg. Head tremors and contractions, changing in\r\nrelation to posture; glove anesthesia and local anesthesia of trunk.\r\n\r\n=Case 212.= (ARINSTEIN, September, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian private, 24, was wounded twice: once in the head by a bullet,\r\nand at another time by a bit of shrapnel that imbedded itself in the\r\nskull. The hair over the injured spot became gray.\r\n\r\nLater, September 16, 1915, the soldier was subjected to shell-shock,\r\nand at the same time wounded by shrapnel fragment in the right leg\r\n(operated next day).\r\n\r\nUpon examination at Petrograd, the hearing was found diminished and the\r\neardrum was pulled in. At first the patient could not speak or open\r\nhis eyes, and made incessant lateral movements of the head, jerking\r\nbackwards and to the right. The right half of the face gave convulsive\r\nmovements, which began at the lip and spread upwards. During sleep,\r\nthere was an entire cessation of these head shakings and jerks. In\r\nthe lying posture, the head shook at a rate of 100 to 120 per minute.\r\nThe jerking movements became more marked when the patient sat up or\r\nwalked. He carried his head bent toward the right shoulder. When he sat\r\ndown, the side-shaking movements disappeared, only to reappear when he\r\nlay down. The swallowing reflexes were absent. The sensitiveness to\r\ntouch, pain, and temperature was lost in the upper part of the trunk\r\nincluding the neck, to the level of the tenth dorsal vertebra. There\r\nwas anesthesia of the arms as far as the elbow on the right, and as far\r\nas the shoulder on the left. The mucosae of the mouth were anesthetic.\r\nDermatographia was strongly marked.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion; burial: Hemiplegia, probably organic.\r\n\r\n=Case 213.= (MARIE and LEVY, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was blown up by a shell and then buried at Vaux, March 29,\r\n1916, and entered the Salpêtrière, July, 1916, with a right-sided\r\nhemiplegia and contracture without evidence of wound. He remembered\r\nnothing for the first fortnight after the trauma. When he came to\r\nhimself, he was paralyzed and was unable to say more than a few words,\r\nbut at the end of a month his aphasia ceased and he began to walk.\r\n\r\nThe hemiplegia was spastic. There was pronounced contracture. The\r\narm was extended, hand open, fingers stretched. Finger movements\r\nwere diminished, as well as extension of the wrist, but the arm was\r\notherwise normal. The leg was not so stiff. The great toe was in a\r\nstate of continuous extension. The toes could not be moved, and the\r\nfoot scarcely; but the leg could be strongly flexed and extended on the\r\nthigh. The tendon reflexes of the right side were more lively than on\r\nthe left. Cloniform movements followed tapping the patellar tendon on\r\nthe right side, and a patellar clonus and ankle clonus could also be\r\ndemonstrated. Plantar reflex, flexor on the right. Distinct adduction\r\nof the foot. Slight disturbance of tactile sensibility in the paralyzed\r\nlimbs; marked disorder of position sense and gross disturbance of\r\nstereognostic sense. Moderate dysarthria.\r\n\r\nTen months after the traumatism, the hemiplegia and spastic walk\r\nremained. The upper limb was now carried in extension back of the\r\nbody, with hand supinated, fingers sometimes in extension, sometimes\r\nin flexion, index finger separately from the others. Finger movements\r\ndifficult and shoulder movements limited. The leg, however, was almost\r\nnormal except that the toes could not be moved. The tendon reflexes\r\nwere more lively and cloniform on the right, but there was no longer\r\npatellar or ankle clonus. Stereognosis slow, but finger movements were\r\nnaturally difficult. W. R. of blood, negative. Probably this is an\r\norganic case.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlown up by a shell; no skin or bone lesion: Mixture of organic\r\n(_e.g._, lost knee-jerks) and functional (_e.g._, urinary retention)\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\n=Case 214.= (CLAUDE and LHERMITTE, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man, 38, was blown up in a trench without sustaining skin or skeletal\r\nlesions, April 5, 1915. He lost consciousness for a half hour and,\r\ncoming to, found a crural paraplegia and urinary retention. Examined\r\nJuly 24, in addition to the paraplegia were found tactile and algesic\r\nhypesthesia of the legs with preservation of deep sensibility. Pains\r\nwere felt in the legs, especially in the hips. The knee-jerks were\r\nabolished; the Achilles jerks were preserved, as well as the flexor\r\nplantar reflexes and somewhat weakened cremasteric and abdominal\r\nreflexes. Micturition was difficult. Constipation. Slight paresis of\r\nleft arm. Lumbar puncture, July 28, yielded a clear fluid of normal\r\ntension without chemical or cytological changes.\r\n\r\nThe sphincter disorders gradually disappeared. The knee-jerks\r\nreappeared in a weakened form August 31. The legs could, at the time of\r\nreport, be moved somewhat, though not above the level of the bed.\r\n\r\nWe here deal, presumably, with a mild form of concussion of the spinal\r\ncord, in which, however, some of the transient symptoms are very\r\npossibly merely functional in origin.\r\n\r\n_Re_ complicated pictures of organic and functional nature, some\r\nexperimental work has been carried out. Mairet and Durante set off\r\nexplosives, such as melinite, at a distance of 1 to 1.5 metres, near\r\nrabbits. Some died at intervals from an hour to thirteen days; others\r\nlived. Pulmonary apoplexy was found in the cases dying early. Spinal\r\ncord and root hemorrhages, hemorrhages in the cortical and bulbar gray,\r\nperivascular and ependymal hemorrhages were found, always small and\r\nwithout diffusion, suggesting rupture by rapid decompression following\r\nthe first wave of aerial compression. The functional effects are\r\nthought to be brought about through the anemia of the areas supplied by\r\nthe ruptured vessels. Russca of Berne got similar results and notes\r\ndirect and contrecoup brain lesions, tympanic perforations, intra- and\r\nextra-ocular hemorrhages, thoracic, cardiac, and splenic hemorrhages,\r\nruptures of kidney, stomach, intestine, and diaphragm. As in the work\r\nof Mairet and Durante, the lung proved the most sensitive organ.\r\n(Compare also the human case of Sencert [Case 201].) Some experiments\r\nwith fishes yielded lesions of the swimming bladder. Persalite and\r\nother explosives were used.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASSING: Organic-looking picture.\r\n\r\n=Case 215.= (NEIDING, May, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA German soldier, 21, was a serious case of gassing. He was unconscious\r\ntwo days (venesection twice). When he came to, he could not walk and\r\nfelt as if he were drunk. October 22, 1916, he was incoördinate in\r\nwalking and tended to fall forward when standing with eyes closed.\r\nThe ataxia of the legs was demonstrable in the position of dorsal\r\ndecubitus, and there was also a slight ataxia of the arms. The pupils\r\nwere dilated and reacted poorly to light.\r\n\r\nDecember 12, all symptoms had disappeared. The clinical picture in\r\nthis case was somewhat like that of a multiple sclerosis. According to\r\nNeiding, the disorder is not a functional one but an organic cerebellar\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the neurology of gas poisoning, Neiding regards the condition as\r\na new nosological unit. We do not know what the ultimate results of\r\napparently cured cases will be. Court questions of importance will\r\ndoubtless arise with reference to their compensation. Ninety-six\r\nof Neiding’s 274 cases failed to show any nerve symptoms whatever;\r\nforty-six cases showed one symptom only, such as headache, dizziness,\r\nabnormality of reflexes, or abnormality in sensation. One hundred and\r\nthirty-two cases presented a fairly full picture. The picture of a\r\ncomplete traumatic neurosis not infrequently appears, aided perhaps by\r\nthe psychic features of the gas attacks; and possibly some cases are\r\nentirely psychogenic from the beginning. Such symptoms, for example, as\r\ndermatographia, rapid and irregular heart, hyperidrosis, blepharospasm,\r\nmental perturbation, hypochondria, etc., do not necessarily point to\r\nany directly toxic effect of the gases. Thirty-seven of Neiding’s cases\r\nshowed pupillary changes, hyperreflexia, and analgesia. Thirty-one\r\nshowed analgesia and absence of laryngeal and corneal reflexes.\r\nTwenty-six showed pupillary changes and hyperreflexia, four of these\r\nlatter showing also an absence of laryngeal and corneal reflexes. One\r\ncase yielded hyperalgesia alone; ten yielded headache, dizziness, and\r\nanalgesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASSING: Mutism, tremors, depression, battle dreams.\r\n\r\n=Case 216.= (WILTSHIRE, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, aged 27, had been at the front for three months. He was\r\nwounded a month before coming to hospital; but when the wound healed he\r\nwent back to the front, quite mute but intelligent and able to write\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n    “We were on our way to the trenches, and as we were going\r\n    through the railway cutting they started to shell us, with gas\r\n    shells mostly, and we had not been there more than quarter\r\n    of an hour when I was compelled to lie down from temporary\r\n    blindness and weakness through getting a dose of gas through my\r\n    mouth and eyes. I was lying down for about ten minutes when a\r\n    shell came somewhere near, and was struck by something in the\r\n    face and on my left knee and I remembered no more until I found\r\n    myself in hospital. I was all of a shake and while lying down\r\n    would frequently jump up and wonder where I was.”\r\n\r\nThe patient had been mute thereafter, depressed, and given to dreams\r\nabout fighting and shells. There was a fine tremor controllable by the\r\nwill; the knee-jerks were increased. On lateral deviation, there was\r\ndifficulty in fixing the eyes. There was a slight deafness due to an\r\nold discharging left ear. According to Wiltshire, Shell-shock is only\r\nexceptionally caused by chemical poisoning from gas.\r\n\r\n_Re_ poisoning by certain German asphyxiating gases, Sereysky reports\r\nin 1917 that these gases contained, among other poisons, a nerve\r\npoison. He found that poor heredity was a favorable soil for the action\r\nof this nerve poison. The clinical pictures in the gassed soldiers\r\nrather suggested cerebral arteriosclerosis. He remarks that the logical\r\ndistance between the “exogenous” and “endogenous” is greatly reduced\r\nin these gassed cases, as the syndrome of “exogenous” gassing closely\r\napproximates that of various “endogenous” disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical speech disorder related to mechanical disorder of auditory\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\n=Case 217.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nWhenever a German officer’s servant, 23 years, was addressed on the\r\nward in the Jena Nerve Hospital, his hands would tremble and the\r\nmuscles of his face would fall into grimacing associated movements. He\r\nhad a peculiar infantile type of speech, talking with a fixed glance\r\nand an anxious mien. He would carefully utter, as a rule, separate\r\nwords, chiefly only nouns or infinitives. He would gesticulate with\r\nboth hands to make what he said understood. Thus (freely translating\r\nthe German) runs his description of a battle:\r\n\r\n“Well--because--I--we had--no artillery and so many losses--then got\r\nin position again, then we--laid down a long time--perhaps until four\r\no’clock in the afternoon--five--and--and it happened that--lay in\r\nRübenfeld--couldn’t go back--then shell near me--fell in and I right\r\nnear, how--how far--I don’t know and--grown better. Comrade said--10\r\nmeters--don’t know--un--unconscious.”\r\n\r\nLong compound German words could not be repeated, since after the first\r\nor second syllable there was a severe emotional excitement; syllable\r\narticulation and phonation ceased. Finally, however, the patient\r\ncould be gotten to pronounce the whole word. Reading aloud was very\r\ndifficult: syllable sounding and omission of difficult syllables; after\r\na time, weeping.\r\n\r\nThe patient was a somewhat small, muscular, well-nourished man, with\r\na murmur at the apex, a somewhat rapid pulse, increased reflexes,\r\nespecially skin reflexes, painful supra- and infra-orbital points,\r\ntemples painful to percussion, pressure over spine painful from\r\nsecond thoracic to third lumbar vertebrae. There was an increased\r\nsensitiveness to touch and pain over the whole body. There was a\r\nbilateral, somewhat marked tremor, more marked on the left side than on\r\nthe right. Swaying in Romberg position was slight. Tremor of tongue.\r\n\r\nThis patient was first brought to Jena November 23, 1914. An\r\nillegitimate child, a moderately good scholar, he had worked as a mason\r\nuntil he went into the army, in 1912. He worked as a soldier chiefly in\r\nthe officers’ casino because he got pains in his legs and knees in long\r\ndrills. At the outset of the campaign, however, he withstood the heavy\r\nmarching, although with difficulty. He was in his first actual skirmish\r\nSeptember 20. A shell struck nearby and threw him several meters;\r\nwhereupon he became unconscious and was carried away by the hospital\r\ncorps. When he woke up he could not speak or hear. Ten days later,\r\nhowever, speech returned, and hearing returned in right ear; October,\r\ndeaf in the left ear, and he could not hear a watch tick on the right\r\nside at a distance of 16 centimeters. He was examined at the otological\r\nclinic in Jena October 12, where the drum membranes were both found\r\nopaque, without reflexes or normal contours; hysterical attack on the\r\ncaloric test. The next day, on the medical visit, there was a screaming\r\nattack. His plight seemed not so much simulation as one of traumatic\r\nhysteria.\r\n\r\nAgain, after his stay at the nerve hospital, another hysterical\r\noutburst was produced by a hearing test with vestibular apparatus, in\r\nthe ear clinic, February 6, 1915. The diagnosis was nervous deafness\r\nwith involvement of left ear.\r\n\r\nThe insomnia was successfully treated by sodium bicarbonate. There was\r\na slight improvement in speech. In March body weight had improved, but\r\nthere was a marked tremor of the right hand. In the next few months\r\nthere was a progressive improvement in general well-being, in speech\r\ndisorder, and in tremor. The auditory disorder remained unchanged. The\r\nman now works in his father’s garden.\r\n\r\nThis case appears to show a combination of psychic and mechanical\r\ninjury. There are severe hysterical auditory and speech disorders.\r\nAlthough the auditory disorder is of mechanical origin, the speech\r\ndisorder appears to be of psychogenic nature. It is somewhat remarkable\r\nthat the ear tests almost every time produce hysterical attacks in the\r\nform of convulsive crying. Rather unusual is the general cutaneous\r\nhyperalgesia, more marked about the ears.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock (distant, neither seen nor heard); left tympanum ruptured;\r\nsemicoma eight days: Cerebellar syndrome and hemianesthesia. Recovery,\r\nnine months.\r\n\r\n=Case 218.= (PITRES and MARCHAND, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant underwent “shell-shock” either at night or in the early\r\nmorning, September, 1915, the shell bursting at a distance. He neither\r\nsaw nor heard the shell, lost consciousness and was eight days\r\nsemicomatose, failing to recognize his wife.\r\n\r\nOn recovering his senses, he could not get about, as he had lost his\r\nmemory, having to write down his room number and be warned of meal\r\ntimes. He was led about like a child. He had a continuous headache on\r\nthe right side and pains in the occiput and along the spinal column,\r\nas well as in the right leg as far as the heel. These leg pains were\r\nlightning pains. Walking was difficult, staggering, leaning to left.\r\nWeakness of right arm and leg; right-sided hemianalgesia. Complete\r\ninsomnia. During November there were frequent urgent desires to urinate\r\nday or night. Evacuated to the oto-rhino-laryngological center in\r\nBordeaux, December 13, for examination of ears. The right ear was\r\nfound normal, but there was a rupture of the left tympanum. There was\r\nat this time a trismus. The jaws were opened with the dilator and the\r\nman had a syncope during this operation. The question of surgical\r\nintervention for a cerebral lesion was raised, but he was first sent to\r\nthe neurologists at Bordeaux. There, December 31, he was found with a\r\nfacies of anguish, unstable gait, inclination to the left in walking;\r\nno Rombergism; occasional dizzy spells. In walking, the right foot was\r\npointed outward and on request to direct it forward he complained of\r\npain in the loins, reaching as far as the scapula. Walking with eyes\r\nclosed, he leaned to the left and lost balance. With eyes open, no\r\ndisorder of balance. With eyes closed, the body leaned backward. If\r\nrequested to go back, he failed to flex his legs to keep balance. If he\r\nwas asked to put a foot upon the chair in front of him, he immediately\r\nfell backwards. He could not support his body on the right leg more\r\nthan a few moments. He had difficulty in raising both legs from the bed\r\nat one time and he could lift the right leg not so high as the left.\r\nMovements of the legs were performed hesitatingly and slowly and with\r\ngreater difficulty with eyes closed.\r\n\r\nHe could not thread a needle and could hardly dress himself. Eyes\r\nclosed, he could with difficulty perform the finger to nose test; eyes\r\nopen, with much less difficulty. Adiadochokinesis; muscular strength\r\nless in right than left; plantar reflexes absent; knee-jerks lively;\r\nhemianalgesia, right side. Loss of deep and bony sensibility on right\r\nside and diminution of testicular sensibility. Retraction of visual\r\nfield, right; diminution of smell and loss of hearing, right; position\r\nsense absent on this side; stereognostic sense preserved. Mentally,\r\nmemory was poor; he was unable to read or do mental work. He slept\r\nlittle and had bad battle dreams. He was very impressionable and\r\nemotional and constantly complained of occipital pain. He had lost 8\r\nkilos weight.\r\n\r\nHe grew gradually better. In May he could go out alone. The muscular\r\nstrength increased. The adiadochokinesis and synergic disturbances\r\nlessened; the hemianesthesia persisted. In June there was greater\r\nimprovement; in fact, there was no sign of disorder left except\r\nirregular sleep.\r\n\r\nWe here deal with a cerebellar syndrome plus a hemianesthesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nMine explosion: Tremors, mutism, hemiplegia. Tremors cleared by\r\nhypnosis. Mutism replaced by stuttering. Persistent hemiplegia,\r\nprobably organic.\r\n\r\n=Case 219.= (SMYLY, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was blown up by a mine and rendered unconscious. Upon\r\nrecovery of consciousness, the patient was dumb, unable to work, very\r\nnervous, paralyzed as to left arm and leg. The paralysis improved so\r\nthat in the hospital at home the patient became able to get about.\r\nHowever, he threw his legs about in an unusual fashion. Several months\r\nlater the patient was much improved.\r\n\r\nShortly, there was a relapse. Transferred to a hospital for chronic\r\ncases, the patient was unable to walk without assistance on account of\r\ncomplete paralysis of the leg. There was insomnia, a general tremor,\r\nbad stuttering, and a habit of starting in terror at the slightest\r\nnoise.\r\n\r\nHypnotic treatment was followed by almost complete disappearance\r\nof the tremor. The patient began to sleep six or seven hours a\r\nnight; nervousness diminished, and the stuttering slowly improved;\r\nbut neither the paralysis nor the anesthesia of the left leg was\r\naffected by suggestion. The leg remained cold, livid, anesthetic, and\r\nflaccidly paralyzed to the hip. A slight improvement has followed upon\r\nfaradization but the patient still can walk only with assistance.\r\n\r\nSmyly regards this case as probably not a true case of Shell-shock,\r\ndepending as he states “more on a lesion in the nervous system than in\r\nthe psyche.”\r\n\r\n\r\nShrapnel bullet WOUND of skull: Unconsciousness (three weeks), followed\r\nby agraphia (three weeks), insomnia (six weeks), amnesia (six to\r\neight weeks), hemiplegia (twelve weeks), impairment of vision (twelve\r\nto sixteen weeks), dreams (seven months). Recovery save for slight\r\noverfatiguability.\r\n\r\n=Case 220.= (BINSWANGER, October, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA French tailor, aged 22, of healthy stock, was wounded in the left\r\nfrontal bone in August, 1914. The shrapnel bullet, from an unknown\r\ndistance, made a penetrative wound. The man was able to remember\r\nhow at the moment he was injured he felt a sort of strain in his\r\nbrain, felt his head with his hand, found he was bleeding, took out a\r\nbandage from his kit, removed it from its cover and without unfolding\r\nit put it on his head. At this moment he fell unconscious and there\r\nwas then complete loss of memory for three weeks. This patient, who\r\nwas intellectually keen, distinguished exactly between what he could\r\nhimself remember and what he was told by his comrades. One of these had\r\ntold him that he had cried out indistinctly that in a matter of fifteen\r\ndays he would be well. He estimated the interval between his wound and\r\nthe loss of consciousness as about five minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter three weeks, the tailor came to and remembers that the first word\r\nhe heard was Munich. Astonished to be in Bavaria he asked for paper and\r\npen to write to his people, but found he could not write, though still\r\nable to dictate a little to his comrades. Besides agraphia there was\r\nhemiplegia on the right side, marked exhaustion, rapid fatiguability of\r\nvision, power of concentration but slightly diminished, and apathy for\r\nhis surroundings; emotions normal.\r\n\r\nThree weeks later the power to write returned; after six weeks,\r\nsleep; memory was restored in from six to eight weeks; the paralysis\r\ndisappeared in twelve weeks; vision became normal in three or four\r\nmonths; the dreams ceased after seven months. The mood for the first\r\ntwo months after regaining consciousness was slightly elevated; for\r\nanother two months slightly depressed. The mood then became normal.\r\nThere was, then, in this case complete recovery save for slight\r\noverfatiguability in a period of seven months. There were still a few\r\nresiduals of hemiplegia. An operation in November, 1916, removed a\r\nshrapnel ball, one centimeter in diameter, from a dural scar.\r\n\r\nThis is a case of acute reaction psychosis of exogenous origin lasting\r\nthree weeks and leading to complete recovery in an after phase of from\r\nfour to seven months.\r\n\r\n\r\nNormal subject, wounded and thrown to ground by shell explosion:\r\nRecurring MEMORIES of battle scene; persistently HYPERESTHETIC healed\r\nshell WOUND, with pupil and pulse changes on pressure of the scar.\r\n\r\n=Case 221.= (BENNATI, October, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant of artillery, student (one of his brothers dead of\r\nmeningitis), suffered somewhat from diarrhœa on the battlefield.\r\nHe was, however, always able to obtain the best of food. External\r\nconditions did not seriously interfere with sleep. In particular\r\nthere was no excessive dampness where he was. He was preoccupied with\r\nhaving to act as substitute for the commandant of the battery. He was\r\nnot afflicted by the thought of his parents far away; their financial\r\naffairs were entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThis almost normal man was wounded after a day of incessant fighting\r\nfive months after going to the front. When firing ceased, he withdrew\r\nwith his soldiers to a trench. Here he was followed by an enemy gas\r\nshell which killed some and wounded others. While outside the trench\r\nshifting mutilated soldiers to the rear, he was hit by another shell\r\nof which a chip wounded him in the left thigh. He felt a terrible\r\nspanking blow that threw him to the ground and gave him great pain.\r\nHe was carried on a stretcher to the medical post across the zone of\r\nfire; thence to a field hospital and from there to a hospital further\r\nfrom the front. He had been for almost seven hours in a sector of the\r\nfighting line which had been almost continuously active.\r\n\r\nThe wound healed in less than a week. But what he had seen and felt\r\nkept tormenting his mind. There remained slight numbness in the wound\r\nwhere there was to be seen a spot of pigment, the size of a two-cent\r\ncoin, with somewhat obscure outlines. The pain was irritated by damp\r\nweather, in certain positions, and by touch, and the pain on pressure\r\nwas reflected in the pupils and in the pulse.\r\n\r\nNo other disturbance, organic or functional, was found.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds; operation: Hysterical FACIAL SPASM.\r\n\r\n=Case 222.= (BATTEN, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA 23-year old soldier was admitted to the National Hospital for the\r\nParalyzed and Epileptic, June 18, 1915, in the following state: He sat\r\nin bed, gasping, with the left side of the face set in a strong tonic\r\nspasm and jaws tightly set. The contraction of the masseters was such\r\nthat his mouth could not be forcibly opened. He himself could separate\r\nhis teeth for about a half a centimeter, but the jaws came together\r\nwhen a spatula was brought for insertion and then failed to relax.\r\nThe facial spasm increased as the jaw was clenched more tightly. The\r\npatient said he was unable to breathe excepting when sitting upright,\r\nand when put into dorsal decubitus he breathed violently through his\r\nclenched teeth and held his breath as long as he could, “assuming a\r\npurple tinge,” as Dr. Batten states, “which was apt to be disconcerting\r\nuntil one was accustomed to it.” Faradism and force permitted the\r\nremoval of false teeth but only to the accompaniment of shrieks,\r\nfoaming, and violent movements of the arms, lacrimation, and sweating.\r\nDuring sleep, the face was at rest. The spasm of left face and of\r\njaw would come on a few seconds after waking, when an observer was\r\nperceived. Attempts to force the mouth open invoked the same procedure\r\nas before in spite of the fact that the patient ate well. In a month he\r\nwas virtually normal.\r\n\r\nIt appears that May 13, about five weeks before, the patient had been\r\nstruck by shrapnel on the right hand, forearm, and shoulder, and base\r\nof the nose, while in France. He had been dazed but had not lost\r\nconsciousness, and the wounds had completely healed before arrival at\r\nhospital. It was about a week after being wounded that the patient was\r\noperated upon for removal of shrapnel from the face. Upon recovery from\r\nthe anesthetic, the patient found himself unable to move the right side\r\nof the face. Unable to remove his teeth, he had been fed by rubber\r\ntube.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Hyperesthesia and over-reaction.\r\n\r\n=Case 223.= (MYERS, March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA stretcher-bearer, 19, who had had 18 months’ service and 6 months’\r\nservice in France, sent to Lieut-Col. Myers the day after admission to\r\na base hospital, showed a remarkable condition of hyperesthesia and\r\nover-reaction.\r\n\r\nIt appears that four days before, he had been blown up three times by\r\naero torpedo mortar shells while attending the wounded. One had blown\r\nhim into the air, another had blown him into a dug-out, and a third\r\nhad knocked him down. Two or three hours later, having finished the\r\njob of carrying wounded to the dressing station, everything seemed to\r\n“go black” in the dug-out where he was resting, and from that time on\r\nhe had been shaky. It seemed that he had hardly slept for several days\r\nbefore he finally gave in.\r\n\r\nThere were irregular spasmodic movements of the head, arms (especially\r\nthe right), and legs (especially the left). There were coarse tremors\r\nand incoördination in moving the arms. With eyes closed, he touched\r\nhis nose with uncertainty. Cotton-wool touch on arms or head provoked\r\nlively movements. “I was always ticklish,” he explained, “but\r\nnever like this; I can’t stand it, Sir.” Pinpricks produced almost\r\nconvulsions. There was perspiration, rigidity of legs, and spasm such\r\nthat knee-jerks were unobtainable. Plantar reaction, flexor. There were\r\nalso visual hallucinations of bursting shells, and these were also\r\nheard when dozing.\r\n\r\nImprovement followed with rest, but about two weeks later, on waking\r\nto find himself being carried back to his tent to avoid a shower, he\r\nwas so terrified that a special nurse became necessary. He was still\r\njumpy the next day, alarmed at footsteps, and afflicted with headache.\r\nHe improved further in three days; remained two months in hospital in\r\nEngland, had one month’s leave, and then returned to light duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; thrown against wall; comrades killed; no visible trauma,\r\nor loss of consciousness: Persistent TREMORS, augmented in intentional\r\nmovements; CRISES of agitation following noise or emotion.\r\n\r\n=Case 224.= (MEIGE, February, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA corporal (an expert gunner) and his squad had just entered a mine\r\nshaft on Nouvron Plateau, January 13, 1915, when a shell, bursting\r\nabove them, threw him violently against the wall and killed or wounded\r\nseveral of his comrades. The corporal himself was not wounded, nor is\r\nit clear that consciousness was lost. The man lay waiting on the ground\r\nfor some time until a communication trench could be finished and he\r\ncould be evacuated without much danger from the mine shaft. He had\r\nalready begun to tremble, and trembled still more while going back in\r\nthe trench.\r\n\r\nHe carried on there for a fortnight, always trembling, but not eating\r\nand no longer able to handle a gun. He was evacuated a month later\r\nand sent successively to Villers-Cotterets, to Meaux, to Courneuve\r\n(a month), again to Meaux, and finally to the neurological center at\r\nVillers-Cotterets, where he remained for two months (April 13 to June\r\n15, 1915). Here he was given the diagnosis of hysterical chorea by\r\nGuillain, and showed lively knee-jerks and Achilles jerks and great\r\nemotionality. The tremors were greatly increased when the cannon grew\r\nloud or bombs burst nearby. Lumbar puncture here showed a perfectly\r\nnormal spinal fluid. He was then sent to the Salpêtrière, June 19,\r\n1915, and was evacuated July 13 to a civil hospital until September 24,\r\nwhence he was sent for convalescence to his home village, October 6 to\r\nDecember 15, from which he was returned to the Salpêtrière.\r\n\r\nThroughout these transfers there had been no change whatever in his\r\nstatus. For almost a year, as the result of a shell explosion, he had\r\nbeen trembling in precisely the same way. All four extremities trembled\r\nequally, unless the right arm and the left leg might be thought to\r\ntremble a bit more. The tremor was equally pronounced in dorsal\r\ndecubitus as in the sitting or upright postures, but ceased during\r\nsleep. The tremors were worse in the evening and it was hard for the\r\nman to get to sleep. The eyelids and tongue showed a few irregular,\r\njerking movements, not synchronous with the tremor of the extremities.\r\nThe head showed few tremors. The patient was able to diminish the\r\ntrembling of the arms somewhat by keeping the elbows flexed at a right\r\nangle and held firmly to his body. If the tremor of the legs got more\r\nenergetic, the patient would get up and take a few steps. Any movement,\r\nsuch as laying hold of an object, carrying a spoon or a glass to the\r\nmouth, led to an exaggeration of the tremors in such wise that the\r\ntremor of multiple sclerosis in its most extreme form was recalled.\r\nIt was very hard for the man to eat. If the eyes were closed, the\r\ntremors grew more marked. The emotion caused by sudden noise or sharp\r\ncommand or memory of his trench life caused motor crises, with coarse,\r\ngeneralized movements, and even loss of balance. This agitation grew\r\ngradually less marked, but the tremors persisted. An attempt to test\r\nreflexes led to violent generalized contractions. There was no sensory\r\ndisorder. The pulse was variable; at rest it stood at 60; if a table\r\nnear by was struck suddenly, the pulse would go up to 120.\r\n\r\n\r\nSharp gunfire: TREMORS; TREMOPHOBIA. A patient’s (an artist)\r\ndescription of his feelings.\r\n\r\n=Case 225.= (MEIGE, February, 1916.)\r\n\r\nOne of Meige’s victims of shell-shock tremors was an artist. He stood\r\nthe hardest sort of trench life for many months without disorder. Under\r\nparticularly sharp fire, “the machine went off the track,” as the\r\nartist said, and he began to tremble. Both arms and head trembled, but\r\nespecially the head, which was subject to small sidewise oscillations,\r\nvariable in degree, and almost permanent,--a sort of vibration which\r\nthe patient could diminish somewhat by stiffening his neck muscles. His\r\nmanual tremor was not exaggerated by voluntary movements. Superficially\r\nhe resembled a Parkinsonian case. He presented a curious appearance of\r\ncombined vibrations and stiffness.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that this tremor had an emotional origin. In fact,\r\nthe psychopathic status of the patient was described by the artist\r\nhimself. “My nervous state, which I thought ought to last not more\r\nthan a fortnight, still persists more than three, or almost four,\r\nmonths after being evacuated, although the trembling is a little\r\nless. I am calmer and palpitate less, and my hands perspire less when\r\nI am emotional or making an effort. At first, the slightest shock\r\nimmediately ran through me, followed by an uncontrollable trembling.\r\nNow there is an appreciable delay between the shock and the trembling;\r\nI can control it for a few seconds but not longer. The subway gate\r\nnoises, a flaring light, a locomotive whistle, the barking of a dog,\r\nor some boyish prank is enough to set off the trembling; going to the\r\ntheater, listening to music, reading a poem, or being present at a\r\nreligious ceremony, acts the same way. Recently when a flag was being\r\nraised at the Invalides, I thought at first that I was going to be\r\ncured by so moving a spectacle, but then I suddenly began to tremble so\r\nviolently that I had to cry out, and I had to sit down, weeping like a\r\nchild. Sometimes the trembling comes on suddenly without any cause. I\r\nwent to a novelty shop to do some errands with my wife. The crowd, the\r\nlights, the rustling of the silk, the colors of the goods--everything\r\nwas a delight to me to look upon,--a contrast to our trench misery. I\r\nwas happy and chatted merrily, like a schoolboy on a vacation. All of\r\na sudden I felt that my strength was leaving me. I stopped talking;\r\nI felt a bad sensation in my back; I felt my cheeks hollowing in. I\r\nbegan to stare, and the trembling came on again, together with a great\r\nfeeling of discomfort. If I can lean against something, sit down, or\r\nbetter, lie down, the trembling gets better and pretty soon stops.\r\nThere are three conditions in which I feel well: first, upon waking\r\nafter 11 or 12 hours’ sleep; next, after a meal, especially if it is a\r\ngood one; and lastly, and above all, when I get the electric douche.\r\nThen, as if by magic, my ideas get clear, cheerful, and regain color; I\r\nfeel myself again. That lasts for an hour or so; then I relapse into my\r\nsad state.”\r\n\r\nAs to the tremophobia, this patient says “In the tramway or in the\r\nsubway, I perceive that people are looking at me, and that gives me a\r\nterrible feeling. I feel that I am inspiring pity. Some excellent woman\r\noffers me her seat. I am deeply touched; but if they look at me and say\r\nnothing, what are they thinking of me? This anxiety makes me suffer a\r\ngood deal. If I am able to speak it is less painful to me, for then it\r\nis obvious that, despite my trembling, I am not a coward. What a sad\r\nsituation this is!”\r\n\r\nMeige remarks that therapeutics is not especially successful in these\r\ncases of tremor. Sedative drugs, hyoscyamin, hyoscin, duboisin, and\r\nscopolamin, do not last long and should be used cautiously. Static\r\nelectricity works well in some cases. Rest, isolation, and calm.\r\n\r\nAs for the military prognosis, a period of observation of some three to\r\nfour months may be necessary to learn the nature of the tremor. If the\r\ntremor then fails to alter, a convalescent leave for one or two months\r\nmay be given. The patient should then be re-observed _by the same\r\nphysician_. Upon persistence of tremor, temporary invaliding. Tremors\r\nmay be wittingly cultivated for medicolegal purposes (Brissaud’s\r\nsinistrosis.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLetters of a German soldier about his shell-shock.\r\n\r\n=Case 226.= (GAUPP, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA volunteer, 21, who had been in civil life a lackey, wrote as follows\r\nupon arrival in Gaupp’s clinic:\r\n\r\n    “On account of our privations and the various terrible scenes\r\n    that you have to see, my nerves went back on me. Like the rest\r\n    of the front, we too had to suffer terribly heavy artillery\r\n    fire from December 20 onwards. December 29 at eight o’clock\r\n    in the evening, when I was about to mount guard at the camp,\r\n    I was thrown down by a shell that unexpectedly struck near me\r\n    across the earth pushed out into a trench. I ran at once to\r\n    cover as some more shots followed directly. I couldn’t be made\r\n    to do anything on the thirtieth nor can I very clearly remember\r\n    the events of that day. There was a terrific cannonade again,\r\n    then cries of the wounded and the sight of the dead, etc. I was\r\n    told afterwards that I fell down, cried, struck about me, and\r\n    remained lying, dazed. The first that I can remember was that\r\n    I was lying on a floor. I was then carried into another house,\r\n    into a better room. Then I regained consciousness and could\r\n    hear again after the noise in the ears had stopped, but I could\r\n    not talk or walk. I was unconscious for two days. I got into\r\n    the hospital train at R. the next day but had to be carried\r\n    in as I could not walk. Travelling in the train made me quite\r\n    foolish in my head and gave me bad headaches; I could not form\r\n    any clear thoughts.”\r\n\r\nIt seems that this volunteer had not been quite up to the hardships\r\nof the war from the beginning; always a weakling, he had to be spared\r\non the marches. In fact, he had been refused by the army at the first\r\nexamination as unfit. He had been a nervous, tender, somewhat anxious\r\nfellow since childhood.\r\n\r\nAt the clinic there was an astasia and an abasia without any signs of\r\norganic disease. The striking feature was mutism. He could understand\r\nthings spoken and written, but he was entirely mute, nodding and\r\nshaking his head properly for affirmatives and negatives. He carried\r\nwith him a few slips of paper with written requests, like: “Please,\r\ncan I have salt; otherwise I can’t eat the soup;” “Are we going to ride\r\nfarther, I have such a bad headache. The doctor must not come. The one\r\nwho wanted to shoot me if I couldn’t speak. They are all bad.”\r\n\r\nTreatment by suggestion (laryngeal faradization, lively verbal\r\nsuggestion to pronounce single vowels, syllables, and whole words and\r\nsentences with enunciation of them) removed the mutism in a few days.\r\nAt first the man’s speech was low and somewhat retarded, but later it\r\nbecame entirely normal. Within ten days the abasia cleared up and the\r\npatient became lively and cheerful. He was depressed on finding that he\r\nhad lice, but after losing them became happy and childlike again.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1, however, on learning that he would be able to do garrison\r\nduty again, he took the news very soberly, and grew more quiet,\r\ntrembled and seemed anxious.\r\n\r\nFebruary 7, he was sent to the garrison, increasingly excited. His own\r\naccount of it in a letter written to a hospital nurse, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n     “As you will see, I did not reach Dn. but only got as far\r\n    as here [Another hospital]. I will tell you how it happened.\r\n    Probably I ought to have remained in Tübingen for a while\r\n    longer and perhaps then nothing would have happened to me. You\r\n    will remember that I was more nervous and excited the last days\r\n    than I had been before, and the cause was also known to you. I\r\n    wanted to get home in some way and so I pretended to be as well\r\n    as possible. That crying attack, or whatever it was [an outcry\r\n    in a frightful dream] had not been thought of by the physician\r\n    any further, you know, and so I didn’t think anything about\r\n    it either. Then the head doctor asked me once if I had any\r\n    trouble left. Well, I spoke out everything I had to say, but\r\n    no further attention was paid to that either. Then when I took\r\n    a walk and after walking slowly two hours could hardly stand,\r\n    was trembling all over and had a high pulse and also a violent\r\n    acute pain in the region of the heart, that wasn’t of any\r\n    importance either. Well, then I just got better from day to day\r\n    and so I got what I wanted only too easily because they wanted\r\n    the space and I certainly would have gone home and not to Dn.\r\n    as I should have. [His reserve battalion was at Dn.] I got\r\n    into the wrong train at St. so as to go home. I kept saying to\r\n    myself, ‘You can’t do that, it will be punished.’ Nevertheless\r\n    I couldn’t act any other way because I was really sick from\r\n    longing for home.”\r\n\r\nHere he described an episode in a comrade who had lain beside him in\r\nthe clinic, had gone off with him and had a hysterical excitement in\r\nHeidelberg so that he had to be detrained.\r\n\r\n    “I was so awfully sorry to see him so miserable. I began to\r\n    cry and was startled by every train coming from the opposite\r\n    direction and by every loud noise. I was stared at by everybody\r\n    in Frankfort and I could only cry more. Then a soldier scolded\r\n    me because I was running senselessly up and down. Finally I got\r\n    into the Leipzig train. Another guard questioned me. Everything\r\n    then got more and more confused in me; I heard my mother\r\n    call; then I heard shooting again; and finally I was entirely\r\n    confused. I came to my senses in a room in the station toward\r\n    evening, and was frightened again at a loud noise somewhere\r\n    or a passing train. Then I was told what I had done in the\r\n    train. I had cried out and raved, tried to get out of the car,\r\n    called for my father and mother, wanted to go home, imitated\r\n    shooting; allowed myself to be calmed a little, but began to\r\n    shout again at every loud noise. When I was out of the train\r\n    I bit a soldier and tore his whole coat open, so then I was\r\n    carried to the hospital here in an auto. Up to this time I have\r\n    been able to calm myself very well. The physician said that it\r\n    was quite natural that I should not have very strong nerves\r\n    yet. I must have beaten about and got knocked against things a\r\n    good deal. There are bruises on my head and I am covered with\r\n    black-and-blue spots.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA British soldier’s account of his shell-shock.\r\n\r\n=Case 227.= (BATTEN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA British soldier, 22 years, who went out to France in November, 1914,\r\nremained well until March 12, 1915, when after shell explosion, he\r\nbecame unconscious for half an hour, and on recovery found he was deaf\r\nand dumb. He was able to think of words but could not say them. He\r\nremained dazed and frightened for a time, and still wakes up with a\r\nstart at night.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted to the National Hospital for the Paralyzed and\r\nEpileptic, March 25, 1915, and on March 27 recovered his speech\r\nsuddenly and spontaneously. By March 29 he had completely recovered\r\nand talked well. Dr. Batten remarks “how perfect the memory may be\r\nup to the time of concussion, and how complete the mechanism is for\r\nexpressing the ideas in written words when that for spoken words is\r\nabolished”; which may be seen from the patient’s own account, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    I went out to France on the 3/11/14 and I was two days at Le\r\n    Havre and then we went on to our 1st Batt. When we arrived at\r\n    our destination the regiment was in the trenches so we had to\r\n    go in. It was snowing hard and I felt it very cold. This was at\r\n    Givenchy. We were relieved the following night and we went back\r\n    for a rest. The next place we went to was just opposite Neuve\r\n    Chapelle on the La Bassée Road and it was awful, the trenches\r\n    were up to the knees in mud and water. The first night was\r\n    very quiet, but the following morning about 9 p.m. the Germans\r\n    started shelling and continued all day; the next was the same,\r\n    but about 1 o’clock the Germans were seen to be coming up in\r\n    masses. They got to within a distance of about twenty-five\r\n    yards, then they turned. They commenced shelling us again and\r\n    they had another try about three o’clock but they did not get\r\n    far. One of the men on my left had the half of his face blown\r\n    away and we had about ninety-two killed and wounded. We got\r\n    relieved after being in five days, then we went back for three\r\n    days’ rest. The next place we went to was Rue de l’Epinette\r\n    and we had an awful time there just before Christmas. We went\r\n    into the trenches and we were up to our middle in water and in\r\n    some places it would have taken you over the head. We were in\r\n    these trenches for twenty-four hours. There was nothing unusual\r\n    happened and we got relieved by the Royal North Lancs.; but\r\n    we did not get far away; we had just got into our billets and\r\n    were making some tea when the fall-in went and we were told\r\n    that the Germans had broken through the North Lancs. We went\r\n    away without any great-coats, and into the trenches we went\r\n    for other seventy-two hours, and if the Germans had attacked\r\n    again we could not have fired a shot as we were hardly able to\r\n    stand for the cold and with the wet kilts on our legs it was\r\n    awful. We got nothing to eat except three biscuits that some\r\n    of the men went out and got. When we came out of the trenches\r\n    on Christmas Eve we looked all like old men and a lot of them\r\n    had to be carried. We went back for a rest to (Nervaille?)\r\n    about thirty kilometers from the firing line for a month. When\r\n    we came back again we went to La Bassée and had a pretty hot\r\n    time there. The next place we were at was at that big fight at\r\n    Neuve Chapelle when 472 guns bombarded the German trench for\r\n    thirty-five minutes. At about 7 p.m. the word was passed along\r\n    that we were to charge the German trench in front supported by\r\n    the City of London Territorials. We got the trench all right\r\n    and I got orders about 4 p.m. to go back to our own trench and\r\n    bring along the belt-filling machine belonging to the machine\r\n    gun. There was not a proper communication trench, there was a\r\n    small dry ditch that ran out in the direction of the trench we\r\n    had taken for a distance of 150 yards, the other 100 yards you\r\n    had to come across the open. We got into our trench all right,\r\n    and I got this box on my back and started back to the trench.\r\n    I was just stepping out of the trench when a shell burst just\r\n    over my head and I went down. When I came to my senses I was\r\n    lying in our support trench where I had been carried by two\r\n    of the men of the 4th Black Watch. One of them said something\r\n    but I could not hear him and I tried to tell him so, then I\r\n    discovered that I could not speak.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock by windage: Hysterical crural monoplegia, of gradual\r\ndevelopment beginning four days after accident. Recovery by suggestion.\r\n\r\n=Case 228.= (LÉRI, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA number of chasseurs were doing the “tortoise-shell” under\r\nbombardment, when the last chasseur in the line was blown forward\r\nabove his comrades by a shell bursting about a meter behind him. He\r\nwas projected some four or five meters, got up, walked four or five\r\nkilometers, found an automobile, and was carried to Nancy. He passed,\r\naccording to his story, red urine three or four times. He was six days\r\nat Nancy, where a slight abrasion of the side was treated. He began to\r\nfeel heavy in his left leg on the fourth day. At Vendôme, the paralysis\r\ngot worse, and by November 17 he had apparently a complete paralysis\r\nof the left lower extremity, called “spinal contusion.” He walked upon\r\ntwo canes, dragging left leg behind and had to be carried upstairs on\r\na stretcher. The reflexes were normal except that there might have\r\nbeen a very slight excess of the left knee-jerk. There was a slight\r\nhypesthesia of the left leg, sharply limited above.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena were strikingly modified, at a single sitting, by\r\nverbal suggestion and faradism, but the man was one of those with\r\n_mauvaise volonté_. He did not want to get well so quickly, so that his\r\ncomplete cure was delayed a while.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF SHELL-SHOCK: At the nerve clinic the patient presents,\r\n_e.g._, sundry CONTRACTURES, of such a nature that they may be caused\r\nto DISAPPEAR BY SUGGESTION, _e.g._, by mental influences during\r\nrecovery from chloroform narcosis (note battle-dreams). PAINS and\r\nANESTHESIAS disappear PARI PASSU with the contractures. The history\r\nis of shell explosion so near as to burn patient’s clothing, fall\r\nwith nosebleed, eight hours unconsciousness, crural monoplegia with\r\nanesthesia (crawled 3 meters, however).\r\n\r\n=Case 229.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nThe treatment of a German private, 22, for contracture of the left\r\nleg and other phenomena, culminated in narcosis. Binswanger lays\r\nstress upon the mental influence to be exerted upon the patient at\r\nthe conclusion of narcosis, at the moment in which the patient is\r\nparticularly accessible to verbal suggestion. Treatment (see diagnostic\r\ndetails below) was carried out as follows:\r\n\r\nAfter a few days of essentially suggestive treatment with continued\r\nattempts at passive movements of the contracted joints (knee, ankle,\r\ntoe), with steady concentration of the patient’s attention upon the\r\njoints, a slight mobility in the toe joint on passive movement was\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nAfter a few more days, the ankle became passively mobile to some\r\ndegree; the patient exerted a certain resistance to passive flexion\r\nof toes and ankle. A week later, reflex contractions of the toes\r\ncould be evoked by deep pin-prick. There had been an analgesia of\r\nboth lower thighs and of the soles of the feet, and this analgesia\r\nremained unchanged. At this point, the subjective complaints of the\r\npatient, namely, noises in the head, especially in the left ear, and\r\nother cephalic sensations, tended to disappear and the patient felt\r\nsubjectively better; yet there was still an intolerable itching of the\r\nhead and spine.\r\n\r\nA month after the admission of the patient to the nerve hospital of the\r\npsychiatric clinic in Jena, there had been no essential change in the\r\nimmobility and contracture in extension in the left leg. Accordingly,\r\nwith the permission of the patient, he was placed in deep chloroform\r\nnarcosis, and the knee-joint was bent at a right angle and fixed in\r\napproximately that position with a bandage. This experiment failed\r\nbecause, while the patient was waking out of his narcosis, the leg\r\nslipped back into extension, breaking the bandage. Accordingly, deeper\r\nnarcosis was undertaken, and the leg fixed at a right angle in a\r\nplaster cast.\r\n\r\nWhile the patient was coming out of narcosis, it was evident that he\r\nhad been dreaming of battle scenes. In fact, Binswanger remarks that\r\nthese dream pictures and the words spoken while going under and coming\r\nout of narcosis, are curiously demonstrative of “_sympathy with the\r\nenemy_,” for while waking out of narcosis, he cried: “Dost see, dost\r\nsee the enemy there? Has he a father and mother? Has he a wife? I’ll\r\nnot kill him.” At the same time, he cried hard and continually made\r\ntrigger-movements with his right forefinger.[6] In point of fact,\r\nthroughout his waking treatment, no one was able to learn what was\r\ngoing on in his mind, his sleep was good and deep, and his emotional\r\nstate was entirely quiet and patient.\r\n\r\n    [6] Compare sentiments of a Russian in narcosis (Case 319,\r\n    Arinstein.) See also Case 181 (Steiner).\r\n\r\nAs the patient was coming out of chloroform and regaining consciousness\r\nof his surroundings, he was repeatedly and persistently assured that\r\nthe bending of his leg was now accomplished and the cramp removed. All\r\nthat he would now have to do was to get back the strength of his leg.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days he complained of violent pains in his left\r\nknee-joint and in the ankle-joint, but he remained in good spirits and\r\nfull of confidence. Accordingly, in five days the plaster was removed\r\nand the contracture in the knee-joint was found to be completely\r\nabsent; the knee was easily movable. The ankle-joint was but slightly\r\nmovable. He could accomplish slight active flexion of the knee-joint\r\nwhile lying in bed, and the toe-joint had already, before the narcosis,\r\nbeen both actively and passively mobile. After a few days, exercises\r\nin walking were begun. The patient had a little difficulty with his\r\nleft knee-joint in walking, walking in fact as if with knock-knee. The\r\nfoot was not well raised from the ground on account of the persistent\r\nstiffness of the ankle-joint. Walking, however, improved daily. He\r\nwalked for three hours, resting at intervals.\r\n\r\nA sensory examination showed that the upper limit of the analgesia\r\nhad come down five centimeters from its former level, now occupying\r\nthe left foot and leg up to the junction of the lower with the middle\r\nthird. There was now a zone of anesthesia interposed between the\r\nnormal skin of the upper thigh and the anesthetic-and-analgesic skin\r\nof the lower thigh and leg. Upon the posterior aspect of the leg, the\r\nanalgesia and anesthesia had disappeared to a point at about the middle\r\nof the upper thigh.\r\n\r\nAbout five weeks after the narcotic experiment, the extended left leg\r\ncould be actively raised while lying in bed, up to the full extent,\r\nwith slight tremors. The patient described himself as fatigued by the\r\nactive movements of this leg. The ankle-joint remained less effective.\r\nThere was still a trace of resistance to passive movements. Although\r\nthe passive movements of the toes were normal, active movements of\r\nthese were weak and hard to execute. There was still a trace of\r\ndifficulty at the knee in walking and the gait was awkward, trepidant,\r\nprecipitate. He could get about without a cane, however. If unobserved,\r\nhis posture was more certain and free. If he exerted himself hard,\r\nsevere parietal headache on the right side would develop.\r\n\r\nIt was then proposed to the patient that another narcosis would rid\r\nhim of the stiffness in his ankle-joint. He feared narcosis and was\r\ntold that regular and energetic voluntary movements would also rid him\r\nof the stiffness. These will exercises consisted in his directing his\r\nwhole attention to his left ankle-joint until he felt it. Then he was\r\ngiven the command: “Let go the joint”--whereupon he would take his\r\nattention away from the ankle-joint at once. In this way, he was told,\r\nhis will would make the ankle-joint mobile. Meantime he was given\r\ntwice daily a gram of bromophenacetine for his parietal headache.\r\n\r\nThe result was a rapid recovery. There were still a few traces of\r\ndifficulty at date of report. The zone of sensory loss had retreated to\r\nthe ankle, with a cuff-like zone of hypalgesia above the definite zone\r\nof analgesia and anesthesia.\r\n\r\nAs to the previous nature of this case, although there was neuropathic\r\nheredity on the mother’s side, there had been no sign of any individual\r\nneuropathic disposition. He had been a volunteer since 1911 in a guard\r\nregiment of infantry. His military training had been well borne; in\r\nthe war he had fought through 20 battles. On November 11, 1914, in a\r\nstorming attack, he had had his breeches burned from the effects of a\r\nshell. He had fallen, unconscious; the unconsciousness lasted about\r\neight hours. He found on awaking that he had had nosebleed. When he\r\nwanted to get up, he found that his left leg was completely paralyzed\r\nand insensible; in fact, he thought it had been cut away. He crawled\r\nfor about three meters to a trench in which there were several wounded.\r\nIn the evening he was taken by automobile to a field hospital, and on\r\nthe 17th was removed to a reserve hospital at Erfurt. Thence he was\r\ntransferred to the Jena Hospital, January 25, 1915.\r\n\r\nA strongly built man, with many reflexes increased and a lively\r\ndermatographia. The reflexes of the left, or contractured, leg were\r\nlacking; the mastoid processes were painful, and the occiput and\r\ntemples were painful to percussion. The spinous processes of the\r\nvertebral column in the lumbar region were painful. The other phenomena\r\nhave been sufficiently indicated above. The head sensations were\r\npeculiar; there were no pains but a peculiar itching. Contraction of\r\nthe fingers of the left hand was painful. There was a feeling as if\r\nthere were lice under the skin in the left upper thigh. There was\r\nitching in the nose, which the patient described as due to the sulphur\r\n“out there,” meaning shell gases. Sleep and appetite were good. Memory\r\nwas imperfect: he could no longer remember the names of the battles,\r\nand of late had had to count on his fingers to find out how much was\r\n2 times 2. As to the curious parietal headache, contralateral to the\r\ncontractured leg, Binswanger inquires whether we may not here have to\r\ndo with localized vascular phenomena of the brain part which might\r\nconceivably be related with the innervation of the leg. Binswanger\r\nremarks that if the plaster cast be left on too long, it may happen\r\nthat hysterical contracture will take place in the new position.\r\n\r\nAs to the will exercises used in the present case, Binswanger remarks\r\nthat the patients must be intelligent and attentive, and naturally they\r\nmust desire to get well. Fortunately, many of the war hysterics do want\r\nto get well, since the contrary experience is had in various industrial\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\nWound of thigh: Pseudocoxalgic monoplegia with anesthesia. Cure of\r\nanesthesia by faradism at one sitting. Cure of lameness by reëducation\r\nand electricity in one month.\r\n\r\n=Case 230.= (ROUSSY and LHERMITTE, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, observed at Villejuif, February 9, 1915, was\r\nsuffering from a right-sided crural monoplegia of a pseudocoxalgic\r\ntype, following a wound September 9, 1914. The wound had been a\r\nthrough-and-through one in the upper right thigh. Every active movement\r\ncould be performed as well on the right side as on the left; but the\r\nstrength of the movements was less on the right, especially that of\r\nleg-extension. The reflexes were normal, the lameness was slight, with\r\ntoeing out; the sole came down flat upon the ground. There was an\r\nabsolutely complete anesthesia of the entire right leg and side up to\r\nthe umbilicus.\r\n\r\nEnergetic faradization of the skin caused the anesthesia to disappear\r\nthe day the patient was brought to the hospital. The cure of the\r\nlameness required a month of reëducation and electricity.\r\n\r\nAccording to Roussy and Lhermitte, crural monoplegia is less frequent\r\nthan brachial monoplegia. The flaccid form is rare, and when it occurs,\r\ncomplete, though the patient always remains capable of executing\r\nsome voluntary movements and can walk with crutches or cane. During\r\nthe automatic movements of walking, some muscles may be observed to\r\ncontract that remain immobile when the patient is being examined\r\nrecumbent. Naturally such a difference in contractions standing and\r\nlying, would be very exceptional in a case of organic monoplegia.\r\n\r\n\r\nContusion of thigh: HYSTERICAL right crural MONOPLEGIA. An ORGANIC\r\nCRUTCH PARALYSIS develops in the right arm, unobserved by the patient\r\nwhose main concern is his useless leg. Cure of leg by psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n=Case 231.= (BABINSKI, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA certain lieutenant, following contusion of the right thigh, developed\r\na crural monoplegia of hysterical nature. In fact, although the\r\nparalysis had lasted several months, the tendon reflexes, the skin\r\nreflexes, and the electrical responses of the muscles, were absolutely\r\nnormal. Moreover, the good effects of psychotherapy confirmed the\r\nhypothesis. But besides the hysterical crural monoplegia, there was a\r\nradial paralysis on the right side, clearly organic in nature, due to\r\nthe nerve compression by the crutch which the patient had employed on\r\naccount of the paralysis of his leg.\r\n\r\nBabinski notes that this association of conditions was remarkable\r\nin that it demonstrated that hysteria and simulation should not be\r\nconfounded with one another. To be sure, it is difficult to tell\r\nsimulation from suggested phenomena, for there are no objective\r\ncharacters that demarcate the two. Babinski had himself said that\r\nhysteria was a demi-simulation; but a demi-simulation is not a\r\nsimulation. The patient was in fact, sincere enough in his belief that\r\nhe could not move his leg. To obviate this paralysis, he had in fact\r\nleaned so conscientiously upon his crutch that an organic paralysis\r\nhad resulted. In fact the radial palsy had only been discovered\r\nincidentally, and the paradox appeared that a purely imaginary trouble\r\noccupied in the patient’s mind for a long time a much more important\r\nplace than the genuine organic trouble which accompanied it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBombardment; war strain; gassing?; collapse; arthritis: Hysterical\r\nMONOPLEGIA and ANESTHESIA of leg, interpreted as a “PROTECTIVE”\r\nreaction. Later, monoplegia and anesthesia of arm.\r\n\r\n=Case 232.= (MACCURDY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA corporal described as normal (“except for some shyness with the\r\nopposite sex”) adapted himself well to training and went to France\r\nin May, 1915, where he was at once thrown into 18 days of almost\r\ncontinuous bombardment. After some initial fright, he settled down\r\nto work well enough, but, when the weather got bad in September,\r\n1915, grew tired of the situation. Bad dreams began (falling into a\r\ndeep hole; being shelled). He thought of suicide, wanted a shell to\r\nincapacitate or kill him, began to have pains in the head, arms and\r\nlegs, and was already groggy when a gas attack came. Whether he got a\r\nwhiff of the gas or not, he at any rate felt giddy, got a swallow of\r\nwater, and when the gas passed got out of his dugout in the open air.\r\nHe was fatigued and much relieved when the company was ordered back.\r\nNow, however, he got shaky and fell in a collapse on a pile of straw,\r\nwithout, however, losing consciousness.\r\n\r\nApparently he had an attack of acute articular rheumatism. There was\r\na sore throat and a pain in the head, radiating to left shoulder and\r\nto finger tips, with pain also in legs. The pain was worse in the\r\nright leg on moving the knee-joint. These pains lasted for a month in\r\nhospital. The leg had been like a log since the collapse on the pile\r\nof straw. Even after the pains left him a month later, the right leg\r\nwas paralyzed and anesthetic. He walked with a crutch and developed a\r\ncrutch palsy. After a month a hysterical paralysis of the right arm,\r\nwith superficial anesthesia, supervened. During a period of eight\r\nmonths thereafter improvement was steady under reëducative measures.\r\n\r\nAccording to MacCurdy’s analysis, the acute arthritis led to paralysis\r\nas a protective reaction. The paralyses are disabilities that would\r\nensure absence from the front.\r\n\r\n\r\nLance-thrust in back, rapidly healed. Paralysis of right leg,\r\ndisappearing with rest and exercises. Later, psychotic symptoms, with\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 233.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nN. H., 21, a laborer, industrious and sober (mother healthy, father\r\ninsane and a suicide; patient somewhat sickly in childhood after\r\npneumonia, a good scholar) volunteered at the outbreak of the war.\r\nEarly in November he was on the Eastern front. November 17 to 22 he\r\nwas in a number of small reconnoitring skirmishes almost daily, as a\r\ncavalryman. On the 22d, there was a clash with a Cossack patrol of far\r\nsuperior numbers. Eight German horsemen cut their way through, riding\r\nabout 4 kilometers back to their squadron.\r\n\r\nWhile dismounting, N. H. discovered that his back was wet. It occurred\r\nto him at once that he had been wounded. However, he successfully\r\ndismounted and then collapsed, feeling as if his right leg had fallen\r\nasleep. His companions found a wound in his back, which had come from\r\na lance-thrust. The wound was bandaged. He was transported to Germany\r\non a peasant’s wagon, the trip occupying six days, and on December 6 he\r\ncame to the surgical clinic in Jena. The wound was insignificant and\r\nhealed quickly.\r\n\r\nThe leg remained motionless, and on December 10 the patient was\r\nreferred to the nerve hospital. He was a small, slenderly-built man,\r\nwith poor nutrition, weighing 108 pounds. The scar, about 1 cm. long,\r\nalongside the thoracic vertebra, was still somewhat red and but\r\nslightly sensitive to pressure. Neurologically, the knee-jerks and\r\nAchilles jerks were greater on the right than on the left, and there\r\nwas on the right side a distinct patella and ankle clonus. There was no\r\nBabinski reaction on either side.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the right leg were not of wide excursion, and flexion\r\nand extension of the knee and ankle-joints, while lying on the back,\r\nwere slowly and hesitatingly performed, with an expression of pain, and\r\nwith visible effort by the quadriceps muscles. Flexion and extension\r\nof the toes were likewise difficult, and when the toes were stretched\r\nthere was a distinct contraction of the tibialis anticus. Electrically\r\nthe muscles were normal. On passive motion, there was slight spastic\r\ntension in the musculature of the right leg, and the patient said he\r\nfelt marked pain. In walking, the right leg was moved with a limp and\r\nwith the evident design of sparing it. The knee was imperfectly bent\r\nand the sole of the foot was dragged along the ground. There were short\r\nout-throwing movements of the lower leg.\r\n\r\nPain sense was normal, or possibly slightly in excess. There were\r\npainful points on pressure on the lower part of the os sacrum and\r\ncoccyx and over the right sciatic and tibial nerves. Intelligence\r\nexamination showed school knowledge to be extremely poor and\r\ncalculation ability poor. Critical judgment and reasoning power were\r\ndeficient. Memory and perception were without marked disturbance.\r\nThe patient was dull and without interest in his surroundings. He\r\ncomplained that his right leg was as if dead and that he felt great\r\npain in any attempt to move it. He also complained of pains at night\r\nin the region of the right shoulder and neck. His nerves, he said, had\r\nbeen very weak since his trip back from the front, during which trip he\r\nhad been very cold and poorly cared for.\r\n\r\nTreatment consisted of rest in bed, application of moist packs to\r\nthe right leg, active and passive exercises of the right leg. After\r\nten days he made his first independent attempts to walk, and active\r\nmovements of the right leg in dorsal decubitus became unrestricted and\r\npainless. He remained somewhat unsteady in station, showing bilateral\r\ntwitchings and movements of the right leg muscles. In walking the right\r\nleg was dragged behind in a spastic-paretic fashion. Appetite improved;\r\nspasms decreased; but at the end of December foot clonus was still\r\npersistent.\r\n\r\nUpon January 10 there was an odd mental change. He became seclusive and\r\nsuspicious. January 15 he expressed ideas of poisoning; his sister, he\r\nsaid, wanted to poison him, and others were watching him suspiciously;\r\nhis room-mates were talking about him; in fact, he thought one comrade\r\nwas an Englishman. Sleep was poor. At the end of January, after a short\r\nperiod of improvement, he again had ideas of being poisoned, and had\r\ndream-like, unclear thoughts. His actions became incoherent: he would\r\nundress suddenly in the daytime and go to bed, getting up five minutes\r\nlater and dressing. Senseless postcards were written.\r\n\r\nThis condition lasted a few days only, whereupon the mental and bodily\r\ncondition greatly improved. Daily walks were then taken in the garden\r\nand in the city without exertion. The ankle-clonus on the right side\r\nwas now decidedly weaker but did not entirely disappear. The muscle\r\npower on the right side was somewhat less than on the left.\r\n\r\nThe patient was very homesick, and on March 14 was sent home.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock--six days later, crural monoplegia, cured by suggestion.\r\n“Metatraumatic” hysteria. HYPERSENSITIVE PHASE AFTER SHELL-SHOCK.\r\n\r\n=Case 234.= (SCHUSTER, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nOn August 13, 1915, a soldier was knocked unconscious by the explosion\r\nof a shell nearby. He woke up several hours later with headache, noises\r\nin the ears, itching, but no trace of paralysis.\r\n\r\nSix days later, on August 19, he was released from hospital, still\r\nfree from paralysis. On the railway journey he met some people of his\r\ndistrict by whom he sent greetings to his wife, meanwhile becoming\r\ngreatly excited. When he tried to get out of the train he noted a\r\nweakness of the left arm and left leg; this weakness somewhat quickly\r\ngrew into a severe paralysis, so that when observed in Berlin the left\r\nleg was entirely paralyzed, not a single muscle of which could be\r\nmoved when the patient was examined by Schuster one month after the\r\naccident. There was also a hypesthesia on the left side with total\r\nanesthesia of the left leg, which anesthesia was related stocking-wise\r\nto the hypesthesia of the trunk. There was tremor of the hands as well\r\nas generalized increase of reflexes. The plantar reflex, though weak,\r\nwas flexor. The pulse rapidly ran up under excitement. In short, the\r\npatient seemed to be suffering from hysterical palsy. Waking suggestion\r\ndid so well with the man that after three weeks normal sensibility was\r\nrestored to the leg, and he could walk tolerably well without a cane.\r\n\r\nThe point of interest in this case is that the symptom of greatest\r\nimportance, namely paralysis of the left leg, did not arise until six\r\ndays after the shell explosion and then only after the man became\r\nexcited by thoughts of his home and family through meeting his town\r\npeople. The term _metatraumatic_ is suggested by Schuster for cases\r\nof this sort. The emotions and stresses of war may be regarded as\r\n_labilizing_ and _sensibilizing_ the nervous system sometimes for\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\nWound of left foot: ACROCONTRACTURE. Psychoelectric cure, about seven\r\nmonths later, at one sitting, except for some residuals that cleared\r\nshortly afterwards.\r\n\r\n=Case 235.= (ROUSSY and LHERMITTE, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 21 years, was observed at the Centre Neuropsychiatrique,\r\nAugust 30, 1916. He had been wounded in battle, March 16, 1916, near\r\nthe left internal malleolus. Infection followed and inguinal adenitis,\r\nfor which he was in hospital a month.\r\n\r\nEven before the abscess began, the foot had begun to twist inward.\r\nAfter the abscess had been cured, a contracture set in permanently, and\r\nat entrance to hospital was irreducible. The knee-jerk and Achilles\r\njerk were more active on the side of the equinovarus contracture. There\r\nwas even a slight amyotrophy of the calf. There was no appreciable\r\nvasomotor disorder. The foot and lower part of the leg were a little\r\nwarmer on the left side.\r\n\r\nCure followed a single sitting with psychoelectric treatment, at least\r\nso far as the contracture went. Pain and swelling remained in the\r\nevening, followed by fatigue. The patient was discharged cured, October\r\n12, 1916.\r\n\r\nHysterical pes equinovarus shows the foot immobile as if frozen\r\n(_figé_). The foot is extended with the toes lowered and the internal\r\nborder incurved, as if revolved about the axis of the leg. The surface\r\nof the sole is directed inwards and much furrowed. The tendon of the\r\ntibialis anticus is very prominent. The internal malleolus is hardly\r\nvisible, while the head of the astragalus is easily made out. No\r\npassive movement is possible and the tibiotarsal and mediotarsal joints\r\nare quite out of function. Upon palpation, the excessive contracture of\r\nthe anterior muscles of the leg is striking. Upon request to move the\r\nfoot, the foot is not moved, but muscles of the lower leg may contract,\r\nand even those of the thigh.\r\n\r\nThere were no sensory disorders in the present case, though they often\r\ndo occur in this form of acrocontracture. It is doubtful whether\r\nthe skin changes sometimes seen, such as hypothermia, hyperidrosis,\r\ncyanosis, and glossiness are due to circulatory disorder induced by\r\nthe contracture or to the prolonged immobility. It has been proved\r\nby Meige, Benisty and Lévy, that even in a normal subject prolonged\r\nimmobility may cause a difference of temperature of several degrees.\r\nCirculatory disorders sometimes cease immediately upon cessation of\r\nthe contracture. Roussy and Lhermitte insist upon energetic and early\r\ntreatment of these psychoneuropathic acrocontractures, which are apt\r\nto proceed less favorably than the acroparalyses. If not treated\r\nenergetically and early, actual nerve, tendon, and bone lesions may\r\nensue.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; shell-wound; emotion: Hysterical paraplegia. Approximate\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 236.= (ABRAHAMS, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA private of the First East Lancs could remember a shell’s bursting and\r\nstriking a wagon near him when he was carrying food to the firing-line.\r\nHe also thought a spare wagon wheel might have fallen on him. A\r\nperiod of unconsciousness of four or five days duration elapsed, on\r\nrecovery from which he found himself suffering from a shell-wound in\r\nthe left buttock, complete paralysis of both legs, and pain in the\r\nback, by the fourth lumbar vertebra. He thought that he had suffered\r\nfrom sphincteric paralysis for eleven days after the accident; but by\r\nSeptember 25, there was no sign of this. Besides the paraplegia, there\r\nwas complete loss of sensation below Poupart’s ligament in the right\r\nleg, reaching as high as the iliac crest behind; and an anesthesia of\r\nthe left foot including heel and sole, with anesthesia to light touch\r\nthroughout the limb (pin-pricks being appreciated in a normal way as\r\nfar as the ankle); and there was an anesthesia to touch and pain in the\r\nulnar distribution.\r\n\r\nApril 20, 1915, the patient was found to be a robust, somewhat\r\nmicroencephalic slowly cerebrating subject. Total flaccid paralysis\r\nof legs; right knee-jerk slightly exaggerated; no plantar response of\r\nany sort was obtainable. Right leg entirely anesthetic; left leg and\r\nboth arms showed a diminution of sensibility; suggestion of glove and\r\nstocking anesthesia; trophic changes absent. The scar of the healed\r\nbullet-wound lay over the trunk of the left sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the man’s companion had both his legs blown off at\r\nthe time the shell burst. It is questionable whether the paraplegic\r\npatient actually saw the legs blown off, or merely heard about the\r\naccident. Another psychic feature lay in the fact that the patient had\r\na paralyzed sister--a possible financial burden.\r\n\r\nApril 30, nitrous acid anesthesia. During the temporary rigidity, the\r\nlegs were found to stiffen slightly; the legs were flexed. Upon the\r\nreturn of consciousness, the patient was told that the legs had moved\r\nduring anesthesia, and was asked to place them in a more convenient\r\nposition. The thighs moved slightly, and throughout the day movements\r\nwere encouraged against resistance.\r\n\r\nThe next day he was gradually raised to the vertical position and\r\nsupported upright. But at this stage he had become mentally resistant\r\nand resentful. During the day the upright position was at intervals\r\nresumed, and the patient was made to walk between two attendants. The\r\nnext day he walked alone and his mental resistance had broken down.\r\nThere was no longer any evidence of exhaustion and effort in the\r\nmovements, and the patient began to take pleasure in his recovery.\r\n\r\nImprovement was progressive. A pronounced hysterical element persisted,\r\nencouraged by the perpetual attentions of visitors. When discharged,\r\nthere was a slight hemi-anesthesia throughout the right side, and a\r\ndoubtful patch of anesthesia on the dorsum of the foot, sole, and\r\nplantar surface of the heel.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; burial; flexion of spine: Paraplegia.\r\n\r\n=Case 237.= (ELLIOT, December, 1914.)\r\n\r\nA reservist, 34, formerly army instructor in gymnastics, a member of\r\nthe 1st Battalion King’s Royal Rifles, was subject to injury from\r\nthe bursting of a “Black Maria” on his trench. He was sitting with\r\nbent back in his shelter, with legs fully extended. He was in a small\r\ndug-out, a recess excavated under the earth backward from a narrow\r\ntrench and not timbered. The “Black Maria” burst and covered him up\r\nto the chin in a heavy clay soil. After building up the breach twenty\r\nminutes later, his comrades dug him out.\r\n\r\nHe had received on his body the violent impact of the mass of earth\r\npushed laterally from the crater excavated by the bursting of the\r\nshell. Accordingly his vertebral column was forcibly flexed, its\r\nligaments were stretched, and hemorrhages were produced in the great\r\nmuscles of the back. As the twelfth thoracic vertebra is the weakest\r\nspot in the spine, the roots of the cauda equina opposite this weak\r\nspot were probably injured. Such accidents are met in mines.\r\n\r\nThe legs were powerless and numb. There was nausea, no vomiting, no\r\ngas, no dizziness or trouble in the head, not even pain in the small\r\nof the back. The accident had occurred at 8 A.M. Upon nightfall, he\r\nwas removed on a stretcher to the field hospital, arriving at the base\r\nhospital four days later; and on the fifth day power began to return\r\nto the legs. Knees, ankles, and toes would move slightly November 6,\r\nthough passive movements of the legs caused pain in the back. The deep\r\nreflexes were weak, the plantar reflexes flexor. The left cremasteric\r\nreflex was weaker than the right. Impairment of sensation was slight\r\nin both extremities, but the left leg was a little more numb than the\r\nright. The left lower abdominal reflex was lost. A band of hyperalgesia\r\ncorresponded with the left eleventh and twelfth thoracic segments\r\nNovember 12, slight reflex disorders and some degree of paresis of the\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion: Paraplegia; sensory symptoms.\r\n\r\n=Case 238.= (HURST, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant, 23, came to the ambulance September 15, 1914, having the\r\nmorning before been to the firing-line with his company and thrown to\r\nthe ground on his back by the explosion of a shell which he had seen\r\nfalling behind him. He had not lost consciousness, but was unable to\r\nrise. After a night in the relief post, he was brought by automobile\r\n12 kilometers to the ambulance. He complained of pain in the back,\r\nthough no wound or ecchymosis could be found there, nor any painfulness\r\nof spinous processes or irregularity of bone. He had not emptied\r\nthe bladder from the time of the shock. Preparations were made to\r\ncatheterize on the morning of the 16th, when the patient after effort\r\nbecame able to micturate. There was crural paraplegia such that he\r\ncould not sit or walk even when supported. Lying down, he could move\r\nhis legs slightly sidewise. Anesthesia to pin-prick and temperature\r\nwas complete to the groin; but tactile anesthesia was found only in\r\nthe sacral root territory, namely in the feet, the outer aspect of\r\nthe legs, the posterior surface of the thighs, and the scrotum. There\r\nwas loss of sense of position for the toes. The plantar reflexes were\r\nabolished; but there were no other reflex disorders; nor was there any\r\nevidence of other disorder.\r\n\r\nSeptember 20, the man was evacuated by sanitary train in the same\r\nstatus as at entry. January 27, 1915, the patient could walk on\r\ncrutches, supporting himself in part on the left leg. The lumbar pain\r\nhad largely disappeared.\r\n\r\nHurst regarded this case as one of organic origin due to commotio\r\nspinalis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWet, cold, heavy marching; leg pains, rheumatic; no other somatic\r\nfactor or any emotional factor discoverable: Transient paraplegia; two\r\nmonths after period of exposure, brachial tremor, hysterical. Recovery\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\n=Case 239.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA German soldier, 34 (non-alcoholic; married, father of five healthy\r\nchildren; on military service 1901-3; regarded as a very good soldier;\r\nfather alcoholic), got bad leg pains from wet and cold in West front\r\ntrenches September 8-13, 1914. Still he was able to march some 30\r\nkilometers. But two days later (he had lain down in wet clothes in a\r\nbarn), his legs became quite immobile. He was in a reserve hospital\r\nfrom November 3. The rheumatism disappeared, and suddenly, early in the\r\nmorning of November 8, when he was washing, a lively tremor and shaking\r\nof the right arm set in.\r\n\r\nExamination at Jena January 30, 1915, showed no special physical\r\ndisorder. The sense of touch was slightly diminished on the right side;\r\nthe pain sense was normal; movements were free. While at rest there was\r\na continuous shaking tremor of the right arm and hand, which consisted\r\nof very rapid pronations and supinations, and shaking movements of\r\nthe upper arm. At times the tremor would completely cease, and when\r\nattention was diverted the tremor became slighter or quite disappeared.\r\nThe tremor increased when it was talked about in the man’s presence.\r\nThe left grip was stronger than the right.\r\n\r\nJanuary 31, after he had been in bed one day and treated with moist\r\npacks, the shaking suddenly ceased. He then complained only of mild\r\npains in the right shoulder and wanted to get up.\r\n\r\nFebruary 23, he was given three days’ home leave, which he stood\r\nvery well. He now began to take part in the medical gymnastic work,\r\nbut complained afterwards of more pains in right shoulder and arm.\r\nThere was a lapse into the shaking tremor, which lasted with varying\r\nintensity for several weeks. Loud noises or calling made it worse.\r\n\r\nHypnotism and suggestive treatment of the tremor were without effect\r\nMarch 25. March 26, on passive extension of the right arm, patient\r\ncomplained of pain in shoulder and arm. Next day the tremors were more\r\nmarked, but March 29, the tremors suddenly stopped altogether. April 4,\r\nthe pains stopped never to return. April 15, he was given leave to go\r\nhome for spring farm work.\r\n\r\nFour weeks later he returned, sparing his right arm, which he held\r\nstiffly beside his body when walking. If he let the arm hang free in\r\nwalking, rhythmical movements in it began. He complained of painful\r\ninvoluntary contractions in the right arm even when in complete rest.\r\nNor did the condition afterward essentially change; the patient went\r\nhome at the beginning of July.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable feature of this case is the complete lack of any\r\nemotional shock. The total genesis seems to have consisted in the\r\nprolonged exposure to wet and cold, and the heavy marching. The\r\ntremors, limited to the right upper extremity, occurred without\r\nany demonstrable psychic or bodily trouble, and set in after the\r\ndisappearance of the so-called rheumatic disorder. Although there is\r\nno one psychogenic factor to single out, the psychic influencibility\r\nof the case is unmistakable; moreover, the incompleteness of the cure\r\nis doubtless, according to Binswanger, a matter of the imperfect\r\nsuggestive therapy employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFever patient watches barrage coming: unconsciousness, paraplegia:\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 240.= (MANN, June, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant was lying with fever in a farmhouse in upper Alsace,\r\nwatching from his window the shelling of a battery about 400 meters\r\naway. He saw that the enemy was to reach the farm with shell in due\r\ncourse of time. The shells came nearer, say up to about 100 meters, and\r\nthe lieutenant was able to reckon closely when he would be reached. He\r\nwas quite defenseless and unable to get to safety. At the very moment,\r\nhe thinks, when the shells began to strike the house, the lieutenant\r\nlost consciousness from fear. He was unconscious an hour before\r\nbeing carried to the cellar. The shelling lasted several hours more.\r\nImmediately upon coming to the patient found that, although he bore no\r\nexternal wound, both legs and the right arm were paralyzed.\r\n\r\nThere were never any signs of organic disorder. The patient recovered\r\ncompletely with purely suggestive treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncentives to paraplegia.\r\n\r\n=Case 241.= (RUSSEL, August, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA young Canadian paid $150 to have his teeth repaired to be accepted\r\nfor service and then married. The wife became pregnant. He reported\r\nsick after falling out on a route march in a heavy rainstorm. The\r\nmedical officer said he had weak feet and ankles. He lay around the\r\nhuts, was excused duty, and got worse in the wet and cold. He was\r\nadmitted to hospital and came to Russel’s wards on a stretcher showing\r\nparalysis of both legs with slight power of movement at the knee.\r\nStroking anesthesia to pin prick from the knee down. Reflexes not\r\nabnormal. He walked back upstairs!\r\n\r\nAccording to Russel the wife’s pregnancy had furnished a sufficient\r\nincentive, and the M. O.’s suggestion had fallen on fertile soil.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CAMPTOCORMIA (MLLE. ROSANOFF-SALOFF)\r\n\r\n    WOUNDED SEPTEMBER 3, 1914. THROWN INTO AIR BY SHELL-BURST;\r\n    UNCONSCIOUS.

He spat\r\nblood for several days; but the skin wounds quickly healed.\r\n\r\nWhen he got up, his trunk and thighs were found to be in a state of\r\nmoderate flexion upon the pelvis, the trunk being bent almost at a\r\nright angle; the legs were flexed somewhat upon the thighs. The man\r\ncould not voluntarily extend his trunk, but he could extend his thighs\r\nto a moderate degree. He could bend his trunk still further forward\r\nthan its habitual contractured position, being able to pick up an\r\nobject from the ground. If the man was put in the ventral position,\r\nthe trunk could be straightened to a considerable degree. Curiously\r\nenough, the man felt no pain, nor had there been any pain since the\r\nhealing of the wound. No motor, sensory, reflex, trophic, vasomotor,\r\nelectrical, visceral, or X-ray disorders could be found. It was evident\r\nthat there was a contraction of the muscles of the abdominal wall and\r\nof the iliopsoas, yet it was also clear that these muscles were not\r\ncontractured on account of the subject’s ability to flex his trunk and\r\nto extend his thighs.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a vicious attitude crystallized (in the phrase of\r\nSouques) in the form of a pseudocontracture.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlown up by shell; unconsciousness: Camptocormia (bent-back,\r\n“cintrage”). Cure by corsets.\r\n\r\n=Case 243.= (ROUSSY and LHERMITTE, 1917.)\r\n\r\nCamptocormia with antero lateral bending is described by Roussy and\r\nLhermitte in an infantryman observed at Villejuif, February, 1915,\r\nafter having been wounded September 3, 1914. The infantryman had been\r\nthrown into the air by the bursting of a shell, had lost consciousness,\r\nand came to with violent pains in the back. The trunk was found to\r\nbe bent strongly forward and to the right side, and remained in this\r\nposition thereafter. There was no evidence of wound.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1916, a plaster corset was applied by Souques, which\r\nbrought the patient partly to normal station in three weeks. The trunk\r\nwas now no longer bent forward, but was still bent to the right. A\r\nsecond corset was applied for three more weeks, with which the patient\r\nbecame absolutely straightened out again. He was discharged cured and\r\nsent to the Grand-Palais for the reëducation course.\r\n\r\nThis condition is a form of trunk contracture in the nature of a\r\nkyphosis (scoliotic and lordotic forms of contracture are also found\r\nin the hysterical group), for which the terms _plicature_ of trunk,\r\ntraumatic kyphosis, pseudo-spondylitis, and camptocormia have been\r\nin use. The term camptocormia has been proposed by Souques and\r\nRosanoff-Saloff. The _poilus_ speak of the condition as _cintrage_\r\n(arching). In these cases the trunk is held almost horizontally,\r\nwith the head in hypertension and neck muscles and thyroid cartilage\r\njutting. The patient looks fixedly straight forward, with eyes wide\r\nopen, and carries his legs extended or half flexed. The normal folds\r\nof the abdominal wall are very deeply marked, and at the level of the\r\ngroins, the epigastrium and the pubis, there are deep folds. Viewed\r\nfrom behind, the median lumbar fold has disappeared or is faintly\r\nmarked, as are the sacro-lumbar and other masses of spinal muscles.\r\nThe whole lumbar region is elongated and flattened. The dorsal spines\r\nof the back are accentuated; the buttocks are flattened and broadened\r\ntransversely. The back of the neck is marked by deep transverse\r\nfolds, and the seventh spine does not stand out. The patient can walk\r\nperfectly, though sometimes there is a pseudocoxalgia and lameness.\r\nAttempts to straighten the body lead to visible forcible contractions\r\nof various muscles, but the kyphosis remains persistent. There is a\r\nsense of active resistance on the part of the patient, which can be\r\ndemonstrated by palpation. If an active attempt at straightening is\r\nmade, lumbar or sacral pain develops, followed by a very lively and\r\nemotional state of anxiety on the part of the patient, with interrupted\r\nand accelerated breathing, an expression of terror in the face, and a\r\nrapid pulse. The patient then subsides into his earlier attitude, and\r\nhis anxiety disappears in a few seconds. It is much easier in many\r\nsubjects to reduce the camptocormia in the position of dorsal decubitus\r\nthan upright.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurial after shell explosion; lumbar ecchymoses; regionary pains;\r\ncamptocormia, 5½ months. Cure by three months’ plaster cast about trunk.\r\n\r\n=Case 244.= (ROUSSY and LHERMITTE, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman was buried after shell explosion August 25, 1914, but\r\nhe sustained no wound or bone injury. There was, however, a large\r\necchymosis of the lumbar region, and he had felt violent lumbar pains.\r\nThe trunk was carried flexed, symmetrically bent over and quite\r\nincapable of being straightened completely. A plaster corset was\r\napplied March 16 by Souques. Three months of this was followed by a\r\ncomplete straightening, which lasted after the corset was removed. The\r\npatient was discharged well.\r\n\r\nAs to these cases of camptocormia, some authors regard them as due to\r\nanatomical changes in the vertebral column itself, or in the ligaments\r\nand muscles, and accordingly regard the condition as a form of\r\nspondylitis, syndesmitis, or psoitis. This view is held by Sicard, who\r\nbases the idea upon the local pains and the results of cerebrospinal\r\nfluid examination. According to Roussy and Lhermitte, hyperalbuminosis\r\nof the fluid is extremely rare, and one case of their own _with_\r\nhyperalbuminosis was nevertheless cured with great rapidity. Roussy and\r\nLhermitte even inquire whether the fluid albumin may not be due in some\r\nway to an interference with venous and lymphatic circulation.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, this condition may be at first a response to pain,\r\na pseudospondylitis dolorosa, such as may be sometimes observed in\r\nhospitals near the front. Later, however, the suffering in camptocormia\r\nis due more to the abnormal position of the trunk, with strain upon\r\nvertebral ligaments, than to the persistence of any original pain.\r\nMoreover, these patients recover almost immediately from their pains\r\nwhen the contraction is relieved.\r\n\r\nIn differential diagnosis, one has to consider, according to Roussy\r\nand Lhermitte, Pott’s disease, traumatic spondylitis, as well\r\nas Bechterew’s vertebral ankylosis, Pierre Marie’s rhizomelic\r\nspondylosis, Kocher’s intervertebral disc contusions, and Schuster’s\r\nmyogenic ankylosis of the vertebral column; but in Pott’s disease, the\r\nfixed pain points, rigidity of column, fluid examination, and signs\r\nof myelitis, should suffice for the differential diagnosis. Traumatic\r\nspondylitis follows the contusion after months and after a phase of\r\nneuralgia. Ankyloses do not so much concern the trunk as the vertebral\r\ncolumn itself; disc contusion produces disorders in standing and gait\r\nas well as pains and edema. Schuster’s disease shows paresis, hyper\r\nreflexia, and amyotrophy not shown in camptocormia.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion; partial burial; forcible flexion of spine. Paraplegia,\r\ncured by suggestion. Then camptocormia, also cured.\r\n\r\n=Case 245.= (JOLTRAIN, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman in the Côte du Poivre was sitting on the ground in the\r\nopening of a dugout eating soup, when a shell burst and the roof of the\r\nsap fell in on him. The planks and the stonework fell heavily on the\r\ndorsolumbar region. The patient was almost bent in two, head to knees,\r\nlegs buried, hardly able to breathe. He did not lose consciousness\r\nand cried out, feeling for a moment very anxious and fearful that his\r\ncomrades had left. Only two hours later was it possible to dig him\r\nout. He said he had been absolutely unable to make any movement, had\r\nkept his body bent, and felt violent pains in the back. He was carried\r\nback twelve hours later and reached the dressing station in eight\r\nmore hours, eventually reaching the neurological service two days and\r\na half after the accident. On entrance he was prostrated, complained\r\nof lumbar pains and of inability to move, and was able to make only a\r\nfew contractions on the left side when asked to try. The right leg was\r\nflaccid. The left knee-jerk was stronger than the right. Other reflexes\r\nnormal. Hyperesthesia to pin prick on the right side. Slight saddle\r\nhypesthesia, reaching to the iliac crests above and perineum below with\r\npreservation of touch sensation. Slight forward posture of vertebral\r\ncolumn. The patient complained of pain on pressure of the spinal\r\nprocesses and the lumbar spine. There was slight ecchymosis about the\r\nleft iliac crest.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture showed clear fluid without hypertension, in which were\r\na few lymphocytes. There was a large amount of albumin. The blood\r\npressure was normal. There had been a slight diarrhea following the\r\naccident which disappeared on entrance to the hospital. The question\r\nwas raised whether the case was one of slight hematomyelia or was\r\npithiatic.\r\n\r\nSuggestive therapy was tried, and liquid was injected into the muscles\r\nof the lumbar region and the posterior surfaces of the thighs. In\r\na quarter of an hour the patient found himself able to raise the\r\nfoot above the bed. There remained an extensor paralysis of the\r\nright leg. When the patient was made to raise the foot he began to\r\nshow the phenomenon of Souques, called camptocormia. He could walk,\r\nnevertheless, and took a few steps sustaining the weight of his body\r\nby placing his arms on his thighs. Though he complained of lumbar\r\npain, it was finally possible for him to pick up an object from the\r\nground and lean sidewise. He could not, however, stand up. Yet when the\r\npatient was made to lie down, his back was spontaneously straightened.\r\nTreatment of the camptocormia was also successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nAstasia-abasia: Two cases from (a) thigh wound, and (b) shell-shock and\r\nwound of thorax. Cures by faradism.\r\n\r\n=Case 246.= (ROUSSY and LHERMITTE, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman was wounded September 23, 1914, by a bullet in the\r\nanterior and middle part of the left thigh. From the moment of the\r\ntrauma, he had not been able to walk, but gradually regained his\r\nability to stand, and then to walk. He was returned to the front\r\n(January, 1915).\r\n\r\nSlightly wounded again in the neck, January 6, 1915, he was evacuated\r\nand operated on. After the operation he could neither walk nor stand.\r\nHis reflexes were normal; he could perform all movements when lying\r\ndown, although the movements were executed very slowly. As soon as he\r\ncould sit upright, he was taken with tremors and could not hold himself\r\nin a vertical standing position, nor take a single step. If he was\r\ngiven crutches, he dragged the two legs.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of electric treatment--a mild faradic current--he\r\nwas cured at a sitting so that he could both stand and walk (March,\r\n1916).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Case 247.= (ROUSSY and LHERMITTE, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAstasia-abasia after shell explosion occurred in an infantryman\r\nobserved by Roussy and Lhermitte at Villejuif, July 8, 1915.\r\n\r\nThe patient had been wounded September, 1914. The wound was a\r\nsuperficial one in the thoracic wall, under the right nipple. He had\r\nbeen cast into a very deep shell hole, but had been able to get back to\r\nthe aid station alone, taking very short steps only.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he reached the station, his gait became spastic, trembling\r\nand hesitant. Given two canes, he could walk painfully, trembling.\r\nAt each step, he would balance his body back and forth. He gave the\r\nimpression of a man drawing some sort of vehicle, who had to make a\r\nconsiderable effort at each step.\r\n\r\nThe faradic treatment cured this patient at one sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar strain; fall into water-filled trench: Dysbasia, tremors, vasomotor\r\ndisorders. Cure by hypnosis. Case to demonstrate “traumatic” hysteria\r\nWITHOUT somatic TRAUMA.\r\n\r\n=Case 248.= (NONNE, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn artilleryman (without hereditary or acquired neuropathic taint)\r\nunderwent much stress and strain in the war in Belgium, Lorraine and\r\nFlanders. One night, on leaving his observation post, he fell into a\r\ntrench filled with water. He felt pricks in the groin and gradually\r\ndeveloped a pseudospastic tremor of the lower extremity, paraparesis\r\ninferior, depression, irritability, pressure sensations in the head,\r\nand sleeplessness. He passed through three hospitals before arriving at\r\nHamburg and received the diagnosis of concussion of the brain and cord.\r\n\r\nNonne found an emotional state of depression with hypochondriacal\r\nfear, disturbance of sleep, deficient appetite, constipation and\r\npollakisuria. He walked upon two crutches, dragging his legs inertly\r\nafter him. There was marked cyanosis, lowered temperature and\r\nhyperidrosis of the feet and lower legs; exaggeration of tendon and\r\nskin reflexes and pseudoclonus; no Babinski or Oppenheim reaction.\r\nThere was anesthesia of the lower extremities and of trunk as high as\r\nthe ribs. Pulse 130. Visual fields normal. Sensory disorders absent.\r\n\r\nAfter the first hypnotic treatment the patient was able to stand and\r\ntake a number of steps, and the tremor gradually diminished. After two\r\ntreatments standing became normal and walking was much improved, the\r\ntremor ceased, cyanosis and hyperidrosis disappeared, and the movements\r\nof the bowels and urination became normal. Thereafter the patient had\r\nno attention paid to him deliberately and in a week’s time became well.\r\n\r\nHere is a case in which, as Nonne states, the somatic trauma required\r\nby Oppenheim as the basis of every traumatic neurosis did not occur.\r\nMoreover, the sudden cures by hypnotism, or by any other method in\r\nthese cases, warrant us in supposing that there are no such fine\r\nmolecular changes as Oppenheim and von Sarbo assert. Such experience\r\nas the cures in this group of cases confirms, according to Nonne,\r\nthe surprising result first achieved in this war (Bonhoeffer, Wagner\r\nvon Jauregg, Karplus, Wollenberg, Westphal) that the most severe\r\nneuroses produced by somatic and psychic traumata can be cured in an\r\nastoundingly rapid manner without residuals.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the controversy over Oppenheim’s traumatic neurosis, Nonne holds\r\nwith the Charcot school that traumatic neurosis is clinically identical\r\nwith hysteria. Oppenheim admits the part played by psychogenesis,\r\nbut has always laid a greater emphasis upon the actual injury of\r\nthe neuronic apparatus in which he believes. He thinks that small\r\nhemorrhages, inflammatory processes, and degenerative processes affect\r\nthe neurones unfavorably, and permit the psychogenic effects to occur\r\nmore readily. Of course the insurance-company attitude and the attitude\r\nof railway corporations saw malingering in all cases, and to this day,\r\nneurologists are inclined to see a great deal of “indemnity neurosis”\r\nin these cases. Opposed to the corporation men and the neurologists\r\nwere the psychiatrists, who chiefly upheld an emotional theory of\r\ngenesis--whence we began to hear of the neuroses of fright and of\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nOppenheim claims to have established with war cases the fact that\r\nan entirely normal person without heredity and without antebellum\r\nacquired soil, may develop a neurosis through war stress. Oppenheim\r\nconcedes that there may be purely psychic cases, but holds that there\r\nare nevertheless, numerous purely physical cases and a great number\r\nof cases of a compound nature, which are both physical and psychical\r\nin their etiology. Oppenheim’s point is not that every single symptom\r\ndescribed _may_ not be upon occasion psychogenic, but that the data\r\nof this war prove that neuronic injury, particularly injury of the\r\nperipheral neurones, can also produce these effects. Nonne, Forster,\r\nLewandowsky, and others, opposed Oppenheim’s views vehemently. See\r\nespecially comments by Zeehandelaar.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; BURIAL HEAD DOWN: Brachial monoplegia, head-shaking,\r\nspeech disorder, corneal and conjunctival reflexes absent.\r\nDetermination of hysterical phenomena to parts buried.\r\n\r\n=Case 249.= (ARINSTEIN, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA Russian private was buried after a shell explosion, September 13,\r\n1915, head down, so that only his legs stuck out of the débris.\r\nAfterward his right hand refused to move, and there was edema of the\r\nright wrist, with pain referred to the shoulder joint. The head shook\r\nand made jerky movements during the day, but ceased them in sleep.\r\nSpeech was retarded; words were uttered clearly enough but in a\r\nsing-song fashion; sometimes the man stammered. Hearing was diminished\r\nin the right ear. Pupillary responses were lively, but the swallowing\r\nreflexes were diminished, and the corneal and conjunctival reflexes\r\nwere absent. The tendon reflexes were lively on both sides. There were\r\nno pathological reflexes.\r\n\r\nAt the end of October--six weeks later--the patient was sent home on\r\nconvalescence for three months, and improved rapidly after a short\r\ntime in family surroundings. He was examined again, two months after\r\ndischarge, and found normal in all respects. He returned to the ranks.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Shell-shock in Russians, Arinstein concludes that concussion\r\nhysteria may occur in a perfectly normal person, yet be innocent of\r\nall organic signs indicating destruction of peripheral or central\r\nneurones. Rifle or machine-gun fire had not in his experience brought\r\nabout concussion hysteria, which was invariably due to the bursting of\r\na large projectile. With reference to Schuster’s remark that a sleeping\r\nman never acquires hysteria from the bursting of a shell near by,\r\nArinstein confirms Schuster, finding amongst 2000 cases no instance in\r\na soldier sleeping at the time the shell burst.\r\n\r\n_Re_ effects of cannonading, Gerver reports Russian instances of a kind\r\nof hysterical _clavus_, or sensation of a nail being driven into the\r\nback of the head, in men who have been a number of days under stiff\r\nshelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple wounds and bullet wound of palm: ACROPARALYSIS. Cure, five\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n=Case 250.= (ROUSSY AND LHERMITTE, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA patient was observed at Villejuif, February 5, 1915. He had been\r\nwounded, January 2, 1915, and showed scars of a bayonet wound on the\r\nanterior surface of the right thigh, of a lance wound on the dorsal\r\nsurface of the right foot, and of a bullet wound in the palm of the\r\nleft hand.\r\n\r\nThere was left wrist drop with fingers extended. On the sensory side,\r\nthere was a glove anesthesia and analgesia up to the bend of the elbow.\r\nThe right leg showed a paresis and contracture, but there were no\r\nsensory disorders in the legs. Reflexes were normal. The patient was\r\ndischarged cured, in May, 1915 (psychoelectric method).\r\n\r\nThis is an example of the so-called acroparalyses, paralyses limited\r\nto the hand or foot, many of which have developed in this war, after\r\ngrazing wounds or more severe injury. More rarely they appear as if\r\nspontaneously. Sometimes they are preceded by slight arthralgia or\r\nvague pains.\r\n\r\nThe condition in the hand suggests a radial paralysis. The patient\r\nis unable to flex his fingers, though he probably is able to make\r\nsome movements with his thumb. Sometimes, on request to move the\r\nhand, a series of coarse oscillations follows, somewhat like a\r\ntremor. These oscillations are, according to Roussy and Lhermitte,\r\napparently pathognomonic, and depend upon the contraction of the\r\nmuscles antagonistic to those whose movement has been requested. These\r\nantagonistic muscles, themselves entirely incapable of voluntary\r\nmovement, are seen to be contracting effectively and jerkily to meet\r\nthe action of the agonists, also seen making jerky movements. If the\r\nforearm is moved passively and rapidly, the hand flops about inert,\r\nlike the hand of a marionette, although not to the degree of hypotonia\r\nin organic paralysis. The hand is often cold, moist, and cyanotic, and\r\neven possibly analgesic and hypesthetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet wound of arm: Apparent radial paralysis, not resolved by\r\nself-preservative swimming movements. Paralysis actually hysterical.\r\n\r\n=Case 251.= (CHARTIER, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA professional acrobat, 22, Corporal in an African Chasseur regiment,\r\nwas rather instructively tattooed and had apparently performed some\r\nof his service in disciplinary companies. In short, one might have\r\na legitimate suspicion of the objective value of any manifestations\r\nhe might present. However, one of his chiefs had written a favorable\r\nletter concerning his services. He had had various crises of a\r\nhysterical character since adolescence, and there was alcoholism in the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nHe was wounded May 4, 1915, by a bullet which passed through the outer\r\nand lower part of the right upper arm, and thereafter the forearm and\r\nhand became completely inert, both for flexion and extension. There\r\nwas a considerable hyperesthesia. The wound healed quickly, without\r\ncomplications.\r\n\r\nAugust 5, about 10 o’clock at night, the man--then at his dépôt--tried\r\nto commit suicide (motive not related with the war). He threw himself\r\ninto the Rhône from a height, where the water was deep and the current\r\nrapid. His brother and a comrade, who knew that he was going to make\r\nthe attempt, saved him. Chartier himself happened to see the whole\r\nscene, and noted that throughout the affair the forearm and hand of the\r\npatient remained inert. It seemed as if there was a radial paralysis.\r\nThis was the more likely as the man had been wounded in the arm. First\r\ncare was given. The man had not known of Chartier’s presence. He had\r\nbeen under water about two minutes.\r\n\r\nFrom hospital he was evacuated three weeks later with a diagnosis of\r\nradial paralysis, coming on service September 11. Examination showed\r\na slight paralysis of the extensors and flexors of hand and fingers,\r\nand of the hand muscles. There was also a slight contracture of these\r\nmuscles, more marked in the flexors. There was pain upon reduction,\r\nwith some jerking of the muscles. Electrical reactions proved normal\r\nin nerves and muscles. There was a segmentary anesthesia to pin prick,\r\nreaching to the level of the elbow; deep hyperesthesia of the finger\r\njoints. There was no trophic or vasomotor disorder.\r\n\r\nIn short, here was a case of functional paralysis with contracture of\r\nthe right hand, to be regarded as hysterical in the classical sense\r\nof the term, both by reason of the anesthesia and absence of trophic\r\ndisorder, and on account of the hysterical history of the patient.\r\nFunctional reëducative treatment quickly improved the paralysis, so\r\nthat two weeks later the patient was able to extend fingers and hand.\r\nHis total recovery was hoped for, when, September 26, wishing to get\r\nout of the hospital without leave, the patient jumped from a window and\r\nbroke his right leg. The functional paralysis of the hand persisted and\r\neven grew more marked.\r\n\r\nThe interesting point in this case is that despite the powerful nature\r\nof instinctive efforts with drowning persons, this patient, subject\r\nto an hysterical arm paralysis, did _not_ make defensive movements\r\nwith the paralyzed arm; yet this paralysis was such as to be greatly\r\nimproved by psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet wound in brachial plexus region: SUPINATOR LONGUS CONTRACTURE,\r\nhysterical-looking. Callus of fractured rib probably at fault:\r\nTreatment surgical.\r\n\r\n=Case 252.= (LÉRI and ROGER, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man was wounded, December 21, 1914, by a bullet which entered about\r\nthe middle of the spinous process of the left scapula and was extracted\r\na few days later from the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid\r\nmuscle, two finger-breadths from the left clavicle, that is, at about\r\nErb’s point. The left upper extremity was inert for ten days, but then\r\nbegan to move again, although extension and flexion of the fingers did\r\nnot begin at once.\r\n\r\nOctober, 1915, movements were normal, except those of extension of\r\nthe forearm, due to contracture of the supinator longus muscle, a\r\ncontracture that had developed about three weeks after the wound and\r\nstood out along the external border of the forearm, almost suggesting\r\na musculotendinous retraction. There was a palpable, hard callus of a\r\nfractured rib, presumably a cause of the permanent irritation of the\r\nsupinator longus, being precisely at the point where lesions usually\r\nproduce superior brachial plexus palsy.\r\n\r\nWhy should the supinator longus alone of the Duchenne-Erb group\r\nbe affected? Perhaps a single root was involved in the irritative\r\nlesion. The biceps showed also a partial R. D. The deltoid was normal\r\nelectrically and in contraction.\r\n\r\nThe treatment planned for this case of isolated contracture of the\r\nsupinator longus was surgical operation of the irritative focus.\r\nAccording to Léri and Roger, it is sometimes dangerous to use such\r\nmeasures as massage and electric baths for a paralyzed limb, since the\r\nmassage or electricity excite not only the affected muscles, but also\r\nthe other sound muscles,--muscles that are already more powerful than\r\nthe paralyzed muscles and may go into antagonistic contracture. Even in\r\nlimited galvanization, it is desirable to work with weak currents, so\r\nas not to diffuse the current into non-paralyzed muscles. In case of\r\nradial or sciatic paralysis, apparatus permitting the extremities to\r\nrest without over-action of the muscles antagonistic to the paralyzed\r\nones may well be applied.\r\n\r\nWe here deal with a case, therefore, which looked purely functional,\r\nbut in which careful examination and X-ray served to show an organic\r\nfocus of irritation.\r\n\r\n_Re_ nerve concussion, Tubby offers the following definition: Nerve\r\nconcussion is damage to a nerve trunk without actual destruction of the\r\naxis cylinders. The damage may consist of an effusion of blood between\r\nthe nerve fibres following compression of a nerve against the bone by\r\nrapid passage of a foreign body near the nerve. Sometimes, however,\r\nthe lesion which causes damage to the nerve trunk without actual\r\ndestruction to the axis cylinders is nothing more than a temporary\r\nanemia or hyperemia. In most instances, both motor and sensory function\r\nare together interfered with, but in the case of large nerve trunks,\r\n_e.g._, the popliteal, there may be a separate concussion of motor or\r\nsensory bundles.\r\n\r\n\r\nContusion may effect a sort of STUPEFACTION OF MUSCLE and paralyze it\r\nby a non-psychic process: The SYNERGY in contraction of biceps and\r\nsupinator longus is thus SPLIT. Biceps restored to synergy with the\r\nsupinator by massage and faradism.\r\n\r\n=Case 253.= (TINEL, June, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man was wounded at about the middle of his biceps and three weeks\r\nlater was found to be able to flex the forearm only by means of the\r\nsupinator longus. The biceps remained absolutely flaccid and soft, so\r\nthat the diagnosis of a lesion of the musculocutaneous nerve (unlikely\r\nas this seemed on account of the low site of the wound) was entertained.\r\n\r\nHowever, the biceps and the musculocutaneous nerve proved electrically\r\nnormal. In short, this paralysis of biceps was functional in nature.\r\nBut, according to Tinel, there could be no voluntary suggestive or\r\nhysterical element in such a paralysis, since flexion of the forearm\r\nis normally produced by a synergic contraction of biceps and supinator\r\nlongus that cannot be separated voluntarily.\r\n\r\nTreatment by massage and rhythmic faradization caused the biceps\r\nfunction to return to normal, so that voluntary synergic contractions\r\nof the biceps took place along with those of the supinator longus.\r\n\r\nWe here deal, according to Tinel, with a genuine functional paralysis,\r\nnonhysterical--a paralysis due to a kind of stupor of the muscle. Such\r\nparalyses due to muscular stupor ought to get well in a few days or\r\nweeks. Should they persist, it is clear that a stuporous paralysis\r\nmight be transformed into a hysterical paralysis. In short, the direct\r\ncontusion of a muscle or group of muscles may be the point of departure\r\nfor various persistent paralyses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWound of arm: Blocking of impulses to certain hand movements. Recovery\r\nwith splint.\r\n\r\n=Case 254.= (TUBBY, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA private was wounded by a shell fragment, September 16, 1914, and\r\nadmitted to the London General Hospital, September 27. A high-velocity\r\nshell fragment had passed through the soft parts of the left arm at a\r\nspot exactly corresponding to the musculospiral groove. He could extend\r\nthe middle finger of the left hand, but the other fingers were held in\r\nflexion. The last two phalanges of index finger could not be moved, it\r\nwas found, on account of severance of the extensor tendon some years\r\npreviously. Accordingly, the loss of function due to the shell injury\r\nwas that of thumb, ring, and little fingers. Supination could not be\r\nexecuted completely to the extent of 15 degrees; there was no R. D.\r\nupon electrical test, October 2. The sensation of affected fingers was\r\nwoolly. November 3, the little finger had recovered, but supination\r\ncould not be completely executed.\r\n\r\nThe treatment consisted in a bent malleable iron splint, with the wrist\r\nand affected fingers hyperextended. November 20 all power had returned\r\nwith full supination, except for the two phalanges of index finger\r\npreviously injured.\r\n\r\nMajor Tubby thinks this a case of physiological blocking, as from a\r\nsmall hemorrhage amongst the fibers or around the nerve.\r\n\r\n_Re_ inhibition, Myers thinks it is the functional cause of the effects\r\nof shell-shock. He thinks it is not a fixation of the _idea_ of the\r\nparalysis of volition, but that it is a fixation of the _process of\r\ninhibition_ itself that produces the effects we see in Shell-shock.\r\nIt is a block of ascending paths that produces the anaesthesia so\r\ncharacteristic of Shell-shock. It is a blocking of sensory paths\r\nthat produces mutism or aphonia. But according to Myers, there is\r\nalso a block in certain cases of _descending paths_ that control and\r\ncoördinate various mechanisms. The result of a block in the descending\r\npaths is shown in spastic, clonic, or ataxic phenomena of, _e.g._,\r\nfunctional dysarthria. See also Case 253 (Tinel).\r\n\r\n\r\nEight months of war experience (often under heavy fire) without\r\nreaction; then, shell-shock; unconsciousness: Right hemiparesis; pain\r\nin the left side of head; heat sensations of right half of body;\r\ndiminution of hearing in left ear; a variety of asymmetrical bilateral\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n=Case 255.= (GERVER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian private, 24, sustained shell-shock April 14, 1915. He was\r\nobserved, when the shell burst, to crouch down, and then to fall to\r\nthe ground, unconscious. The unconsciousness lasted about two days,\r\nafter which he was found to be oriented, though slow and stammering of\r\nspeech, hardly able to concentrate attention or sustain a conversation,\r\nand giving the impression of a man stunned. There was difficulty in\r\nthe expression of thoughts, and a marked over-fatigueability. After\r\nadding and subtracting accurately two-digit figures for a time, the man\r\nquickly grew confused and said that trying to solve such a problem made\r\nhim dizzy.\r\n\r\nHis imagination was filled with gunshots, shell-bursts, and the\r\nkilling of comrades, and during any conversation the man frequently\r\nshuddered. Concerning the shell-shock, he remembered only that a number\r\nof shells had burst near him and that he came to in the hospital. He\r\nkept looking to one side and to a distance, as if listening, sometimes\r\nbending his head downwards. He would cry and sigh during conversation,\r\nand then be quite unable to explain why. He said there were loud\r\nnoises in his ears, and that his head and the whole right side of his\r\nbody felt hot. Pain was felt in the left side of the head. The right\r\nhand and the right foot were weak (on distraction, this hemiparesis\r\nremained unaltered). Tremors affected all the extremities. He had a\r\nsensation, possibly hallucinatory, of the creeping of insects on his\r\nskin. The hearing of the left ear was objectively diminished. There\r\nwas palpitation of the heart and difficulty of breathing. Tendency to\r\nRomberg. There was a general hypalgesia, more marked on the left side\r\nof the body. Both conjunctival reflexes were diminished. Knee-jerks\r\nand Achilles jerks were exaggerated. All the reflexes on the right\r\nside were livelier than on the left. There was a moderate Babinski\r\nreaction on the right side. Mechanical over-excitability of muscles.\r\nDermatographia. Both sides of the skull were sensitive on tapping, but\r\nespecially the left side. Mannkopf sign on pressure of the left side of\r\nthe cranium.\r\n\r\nHemorrhagic points without injury to the skin were noted on the skin\r\nof the left hand and foot. Speech was stammering. There was a marked\r\ndigital tremor, sometimes spreading to the rest of the body during\r\nexamination. The muscles of the face, eyelids, and tongue showed sharp\r\nfibrillary twitching. The pulse stood at 100 and frequently missed\r\nbeats. Battle hallucinations, visual and auditory, sometimes occurred,\r\nthe commands of superiors and the noise of guns, rifles, yelling, and\r\ngroans; the man would see trenches or redoubts, or a field full of\r\nwounded soldiers or attacking columns of the enemy. He recognized the\r\nhallucinations as such. His sleep was troubled by nightmares of the\r\nsame general description.\r\n\r\nFor eight months the man had been in action at the front, under heavy\r\ngun and rifle fire. He was a courageous man, who had never felt fear,\r\nregarding himself as used to battle and the bursting of shells. He had\r\nnot been wounded. The entire situation seems to have developed after\r\nthe single shell burst of April 14, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCALIZATION OF SHELL-SHOCK SYMPTOMS: Hemiparesis and hemianalgesia on\r\nside of body exposed to explosion; contralateral irritative symptoms of\r\nface and tongue.\r\n\r\n=Case 256.= (OPPENHEIM, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier had a shell explode to his right, October 23, 1914. He\r\ndeclared that the concussion launched him through the air. When he\r\nrecovered consciousness three hours later, he lay in a bog and was\r\nunable to move either leg. Gradual improvement followed. The symptoms\r\nwere sensations of formication in the legs, pain in the back, blurred\r\nsight, hardness of hearing, disturbance of speech, headache, vertigo,\r\nweak memory. After a fortnight weakness in right arm.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted to hospital a week after the injury, unable to walk,\r\nrestless, given to palpitation and attacks of anxiety. On attempts to\r\nwalk, leg spasms and tachycardia.\r\n\r\nTransferred to nerve hospital, December 2. Sleep poor, uneasy with\r\ndreams. Tic on left side of face. On opening the mouth, left-sided\r\nfaciolingual spasm. Paresis of right arm. At first, right-sided\r\nankle-clonus and paresis of leg. Knee-jerks increased. Speech\r\nhesitating. Right hemianalgesia. Concentric contraction of visual\r\nfields. Tachycardia (120). In walking the right arm failed to swing\r\nnormally. Attacks of vertigo, with falling. Patient got up at night and\r\npushed against objects in his room.\r\n\r\nThere was only slight improvement while under observation. He became\r\npsychically more frank and even talkative, and was moving more readily\r\nwhen transferred.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Oppenheim’s conception of the strongly peripheral element in\r\ntraumatic neurosis, he sums up by saying that a traumatism attacking\r\nthe organism at its periphery is in line to produce a neurosis without\r\nany psychic mediation whatever. The rôle of the psychic process, in\r\nOppenheim’s view, is contributory to the fixation of neuroses. Even\r\nwhen there is a free interval betwixt shell burst and neurosis, still\r\nthere are physical effects of trauma upon neurones.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; unconsciousness; after improvement in symptoms (4 months)\r\nreturn to trenches; more symptoms after 5 days: Sensory disorders,\r\nespecially on left side (the side more exposed to explosion);\r\nexaggerated reflexes on right side with slight clonus and with Babinski\r\nsign. Improvement.\r\n\r\n=Case 257.= (GERVER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian Captain, 45 (heredity good; non-alcoholic, non-syphilitic;\r\nalways in good health) sustained shell-shock in a battle in\r\nsoutheastern Prussia, August 13, 1914, and was unconscious for two\r\ndays. He was carried to one of the provisional field hospitals, and\r\nthen evacuated to Petrograd, where during a period of four months, he\r\nwas given electricity, suggestion, and baths. He was feeling so much\r\nbetter in December, 1914, that he went back to the front and headed his\r\ncompany in the trenches. He stood only five days of trench work, and\r\nwas sent for mental examination December 29, 1914.\r\n\r\nThe captain was of middle height, well developed but poorly nourished,\r\nof a dejected and preoccupied appearance, looking to one side in\r\nconversation, and finding difficulty in the expression of his thoughts.\r\nHe talked almost exclusively of his illness. He found difficulty in\r\nadding or subtracting 2-digit figures. He seemed to have amentia,\r\nfrequently being mistaken as to the most important dates in his life.\r\nHe complained of general weakness and inability to work. Any endeavor\r\nto concentrate caused vertigo, irritation, and pains in the head.\r\nDay and night he was troubled about his health, his future, and his\r\nfamily’s future. He was going to become an invalid and a burden. He\r\nwas tormented with the idea that people thought him a simulator. He\r\ncomplained of lumbar pains. It seems that the explosion had affected\r\nthe left side of the body more than the right and he complained more\r\nof pains upon that side. In the dark his gait was unsteady, and he\r\noften had marked tremors of feet and hands. In excitement the tremor\r\nwould increase uncontrollably. The patient thought that his hearing\r\nwas diminished, especially upon the left side, and that his left ear\r\nwas weaker than the right. He slept poorly and had many nightmares;\r\nhis appetite was poor, and he was constipated. There was difficulty in\r\nrespiration; the pupils were slightly dilated and sluggish in their\r\nresponses. There was a marked tendency to Rombergism; dermatographia\r\nmarked; the skull and especially the lumbar spine was painful on\r\ntapping; hyperesthesia of the lumbar skin; paresis of left hand and\r\nleft foot. The tendon reflexes were more marked on the right side than\r\non the left, and there was even a slight ankle and patellar clonus.\r\nThe Babinski sign was present on the right side. There were frequent\r\nfibrillary contractions of the muscles of the trunk and back.\r\n\r\nObjectively the hearing was somewhat decreased in the left ear, and the\r\nvision of the left eye appeared to be somewhat impaired also. If the\r\neyes had been held closed for a time, there was difficulty in opening\r\nthem quickly. Aside from a somewhat elevated pulse and slight cardiac\r\narrhythmia, there was no disorder of the internal organs.\r\n\r\nThis patient remarkably improved but was not absolutely well at the\r\ndate of the report.\r\n\r\n_Re_ organic signs in Shell-shock cases, Oppenheim warns practitioners\r\nand experts against undervaluing war neuroses. He does not like to have\r\nthem set down in too offhand a way, as hysteria, wish-fulfilment, and\r\nsimulation. Hysteria is not likely, according to Oppenheim, in cases\r\nwith permanent cyanosis, disappearance of the radial pulse, trophic\r\ndisturbances, hyperidrosis, alopecia, fibrillary tremors, myokymia,\r\ncramps, dilated and sluggish pupils, and weakening of tendon reflexes.\r\nHyperthyroidism also has been found by Oppenheim.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock, explosion on left side: Sensory disorders especially on\r\nleft side; ecchymosis of right (uninjured) leg, possibly conditioned\r\nupon shock of left hemisphere.\r\n\r\n=Case 258.= (GERVER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn artillery officer had had a shell burst to the left side of his\r\nhorse, which veered to the right but did not fall. The officer’s left\r\nhand immediately became so numb and weak that he could not hold his\r\nreins with it; it shortly became more painful. The left foot showed a\r\ntendency to the same anesthesia and paresis.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, a number of punctate hemorrhages appeared on the\r\nright thigh and lower leg, upon the outer aspect. According to Gerver,\r\nthese hemorrhages into the skin of the _right_ leg may have something\r\nto do with a disturbance of circulation related with effects wrought\r\nupon the _left_ hemisphere. During the course of the disease, pains\r\noccurred not only in the left arm and leg but also in the right leg.\r\n\r\n_Re_ brain injuries produced by shell explosions without external\r\nwound, Roussy and Boisseau have not found a single clinical instance\r\namongst 133 cases observed, which suggested cerebral softening, or\r\neven hemorrhage into the brain substance, the cord substance, or the\r\nmeninges. These 133 cases were observed in army neurological centres\r\nand contained instances of (_a_) mental disease (confusion, delirium,\r\namnesia), (_b_) nervous disease (astasia-abasia, tremors, paralyses,\r\ncontracture), and (_c_) an intermediary group (either mental confusion\r\nwith stupor, or hysterical deafmutism).\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; unconsciousness: Hysterical deafness, speech-disorder,\r\ngait. Recovery by reëducation. Brief relapse to deaf-mutism at noise of\r\ndrums. Improvement. Relapse to numerous and severe hysterical symptoms\r\nat small guns fired on King’s birthday. Improvement. Speech wholly\r\nregained in a quarrel. Recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 259.= (GAUPP, March, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA musketeer, 22, had been blind for a time at 11 on account of some\r\nspinal cord disease.\r\n\r\nHe was a soldier up to Christmas eve, 1914, when he was hurled backward\r\nin a trench in the Argonne by an exploding hand grenade. He lay\r\nunconscious for several hours, though without sign of physical injury.\r\nComing to his senses, he worked himself out of the trench and crawled\r\nto another, but again fell unconscious. When he awoke he was in a\r\nphysician’s care in quarters, to which he had been taken by ambulance\r\nmen. Thence to the field hospital, and then to a private hospital at B.\r\n\r\nUpon admission, January 17, he was hard of hearing on both sides, and\r\nhis speech was peculiar: choked off and retarded. His gait was heavy,\r\non a broad base. He was subject to headaches.\r\n\r\nExercises gradually improved the speech and the walking disorder was\r\nquickly overcome. February 5 came a relapse through fright at the\r\nrolling of drums near by. Speech was completely lost, deafness set in,\r\nand the patient ran restlessly to and fro in tears. After a few hours\r\nspeech returned with still some minor difficulty.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time came fainting spells and attacks of disorder of\r\nconsciousness, with loss of orientation and the idea of being in the\r\ntrench or under cover. He would ask whether it were raining through.\r\nHis mood herein was at times cheerful and excited. Speech further\r\nimproved from the middle of February, as well as did the other\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\nOn the King s birthday, February 25, occurred another relapse due to\r\nhis hearing small guns fired: Apathetic stupor, clonic spasm, aphonia,\r\nabasia, severe deafness, poor sleep, refusal of food. The next day\r\nhe was still mute, but the spasms had ceased. He lay apathetically\r\nin bed, taking a little liquid food. February 27 he was still mute,\r\nthough more active, not deaf, getting up alone, walking unsteadily on\r\na broad base, and playing cards at the table. March 2 the word _yes_\r\nwas again enunciated. March 3 he talked more freely and took a short\r\nwalk. March 4 speech of a sudden came completely back on the occasion\r\nof getting excited in a quarrel among some other patients. The patient\r\nthereafter began to talk a great deal, was bright and cheerful, but\r\nstill complained of a variety of nervous troubles. Speech was somewhat\r\ndifficult, but he was free from any definite aphasia or paraphasia.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Shell-shock deafness, Jones Phillipson states that concussion\r\ndeafness is due to three contributory factors: (_a_) cerebral\r\nconcussion, (_b_) fatigue (violent oscillation of the perilymph,\r\ncontinued noises, strain of organ of Corti), and (_c_) temporary or\r\npermanent disorganization of the conductive apparatus.\r\n\r\n_Re_ concussion deafness, J. S. and S. Fraser found in four cases\r\nof actual explosion injury, a ruptured drumhead and hemorrhage into\r\nthe fundus of the internal meatus in three cases. They did not find\r\nevidence of neuro-epithelial changes. Possibly the fundus hemorrhages,\r\nbesides giving rise to deafness, may start up the tinnitus and\r\ngiddiness that are sometimes found. In one case, there were changes in\r\nthe delicate nerve endings of the auditory ampullae.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Deafness\r\n\r\n=Case 260.= (MARRIAGE, February, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA shell burst behind an English lieutenant in 1914 without causing\r\nany wound but making him unconscious for an hour. During the hour\r\nthe Germans passed by and stripped him of all articles of value. He\r\ncame to and felt himself markedly deaf in both ears with an intense\r\nheadache. There was no hemorrhage, no discharge, no tinnitus, no\r\nvertigo. Four days after the shell burst he could hear spoken words on\r\neach side at two feet, but could not hear a watch that could usually\r\nbe heard from 3½ to 4 feet. With tuning fork C air and bone conduction\r\nproved much subnormal, though air conduction was better than bone\r\nconduction. With tuning fork C-5 air conduction was subnormal. Drums\r\nhealthy. Improvement followed; hearing became normal eighteen days\r\nafter explosion. The treatment was rest in bed with bromides early and\r\nstrychnine later.\r\n\r\nMarriage states that the psychical deafness due to shell-shock is\r\nusually bilateral and absolute. It is accompanied also, as a rule, by\r\nother nervous signs and symptoms, such as aphonia, tubular vision,\r\nparalyses, and anesthesias. Milligan and Westmacott state that the\r\ndeafness is due to a functional suspension of neuronic impulses. They\r\nregard the brain as in a state of physical fatigue, and the mind as in\r\na state of strain. There is no organic lesion. The neuronic impulses\r\nwhich are temporarily suspended are those which run from the higher\r\ncortical cells to the periphery.\r\n\r\n\r\nMine-explosion: Unconsciousness: Deaf-mutism. Recovery of speech after\r\nepistaxis and fever.\r\n\r\n=Case 261.= (LIÉBAULT, October, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 24, teacher in civil life, was in a mine explosion November\r\n27, 1914, at Vienne-le-Château. He was unconscious six weeks and\r\nremembered nothing of what had passed. They had told him that he\r\nhad been blind for a month. After regaining consciousness he was a\r\ndeaf-mute and for seven months he did not speak. His mutism did not\r\nbother him, as he thought he had always been mute. He had always been\r\nable to write. He could not remember what had interfered with his\r\nspeech or tell whether he could think the words which he could not\r\nutter.\r\n\r\nMay 22, 1915, there was considerable nasal hemorrhage, with fever. Upon\r\nthis day he began to speak, at first a few words, telegram style, and\r\nwith aphonia. A week later his voice returned. He was very irritable\r\nduring the period of mutism and had ideas of persecution and of suicide\r\nand complained of becoming easily fatigued and exhausted.\r\n\r\nHis voice, however, became completely normal again and his respiration\r\nbetter. On the spirometer he breathed four liters, but still got out of\r\nbreath easily. His diaphragmatic respiration was still imperfect. His\r\ndeafness remained at the time of report about as before, though he had\r\nnow been hearing for some time a slight resonance of his own voice and\r\ncould hear sounds emitted a few centimeters from his ear. At time of\r\nreport there was still general fatigue with insomnia.\r\n\r\n_Re_ war deafness, Castex states that not merely shell bursts and\r\nexplosions are able to cause deafness, but the din of battle alone.\r\nThere are two big groups of war deafness: one due to drum rupture,\r\nand the other due to labyrinthine shock. Labyrinthine shock--a much\r\nmore serious matter--is produced when a big shell bursts. In these\r\ncases, the labyrinthine disorder is simply of the same general nature\r\nas _commotio cerebri_. The labyrinthine shock cases often need to be\r\nretired permanently from the front.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Deaf-mutism.\r\n\r\n=Case 262.= (MOTT, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA deaf-mute, 24, not of a neurotic temperament or of a neuropathic\r\npredisposition, was admitted to the Fourth London General Hospital\r\nNovember 16, 1915.\r\n\r\nHe wrote, “I left England the 8th of March, and went to Gallipoli on\r\nthe 26th of May, and about the middle of August, one of our monitors\r\nfired short. I felt something go in my head; then I went to the Canada\r\nHospital. They said it was concussion.” He had seen the monitors\r\nfiring. He came to in a dug-out about an hour afterward. He was quite\r\ndeaf and his head felt as if it would burst.\r\n\r\nHe could see and speak a little but lost his speech completely when\r\nBarany’s tests were applied. The headache then passed away, leaving the\r\ndeaf-mutism. The ears, on examination, proved normal. The patient was\r\nable to cough and whistle. He wrote his wife a letter, telling her how\r\nhe killed a Turkish woman sniper, but he did not remember that he had\r\nwritten the letter. Although he said he did not dream, while asleep he\r\nwould assume the attitude of shooting with a rifle, as if pulling a\r\ntrigger, and then the attitude of using the bayonet: the right parry,\r\nthe left parry, and the thrust. Sometimes while asleep he would jump as\r\nif a shell were coming, and he would catch his right elbow as if hit\r\nthere. He would then open his eyes wide and look under the bed. Then he\r\nwould wake up and begin to cry, but without sound. Just such habitual\r\nattitudes occur in soldiers under anesthesia. In hypnotic sleep,\r\nalthough he trembled at his trench experiences, he did not assume these\r\ndefensive attitudes.\r\n\r\nMott states in his Lettsomian lectures that hearing is often absolutely\r\nlost, but that sometimes a man is absolutely deaf on one side alone,\r\neither from the ruptured drum or from the violence with which wax has\r\nbeen driven against the drum. Mott speaks of the frequency of auditory\r\nhallucinations, and of hyperacusis--part of the patient’s general\r\nhypersensitivity--which may increase the violence of the neurosis and\r\nespecially aggravate the headache.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Deaf-mutism; convulsions and dream.\r\n\r\n=Case 263.= (MYERS, September, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private, 28, was seen by Lt. Col. Myers at a base hospital. This\r\ndeaf-mute wrote, “I was standing and a shell bursted and that is all\r\nI can remember.” This might have happened six days previously. The\r\npatient wrote vaguely about a walk to “windy corner”; about being\r\nbilleted in a dug-out, a train journey, and another hospital. He was\r\ndeaf, deficient in sensibility throughout, especially in the left arm\r\nand left side of the face, and had severe headache. Two days later he\r\nstarted distinctly when hands were clapped while he was writing, but at\r\nthe next hand-clapping there was no response.\r\n\r\nAfter Lt. Col. Myers wrote down, “Imitate me,” and made consonant\r\nsounds, the patient succeeded imitating them. “You hear me a little\r\nnow,” Lt. Col. Myers wrote. “Is this the first time you have spoken?”\r\nPatient replied, “I hope the Lord I can get my speech.” “But you did\r\nspeak just now. Read this word. Say it.” Whereupon he was got to say\r\nhis name and number.\r\n\r\nThe therapy was proceeding properly when suddenly he was seized with\r\nconvulsions, limb movements chiefly clonic, back arched, eyes starting,\r\nlater upturned. The patient pulled out a crucifix from a locker near\r\nthe bed and regarded it ecstatically (pulse 85, corneal reflexes\r\npreserved). Three minutes later there was quieting down, and the\r\npatient was induced to talk. He began to talk about his wife. He had\r\njust been “seeing a farm and all the fighting.” A shell must have come\r\nin there. He had “seen the Lord Who saved him.” Intense headache and\r\nthirst followed. According to the patient the excitement was due to\r\nrecovery of speech.\r\n\r\nHe later said, “It was just like a dream when I came to. I was sweating\r\nawful. I was seeing the Lord while I was in the farm by the Captain. I\r\ndreamed that I had the cross in my hand to meet him coming. I saw the\r\ntrenches and the dug-outs and the wife.” In point of fact, the Captain\r\nat the farm had had his arm blown off, and he had found him lying on\r\nthe straw unconscious. Under hypnosis it appeared that he had gone to\r\na dugout from the farm and that at the clearing station he had been\r\n“raving, seeing things, shells, trenches, and things like that, sir.” A\r\nslow recovery was made after evacuation to England. Seven months later\r\nhe returned to the front.\r\n\r\n    This case appears to belong to the B group of mutism cases,\r\n    according to the classification of Myers, namely, to the group\r\n    in which the effects are psychical rather than physical.\r\n    According to Myers, whether mutism occurs as an apparent result\r\n    of physicochemical or of mental causes--that is, as an A or a\r\n    B case--it is _actually_ always the result of mental--that is,\r\n    psycho-physiological shock. Mutism in the A cases of physical\r\n    nature, where the shock must have been grosser and more\r\n    profound, generally proves more severe than in the B cases.\r\n    As to the appearance of unconsciousness, apparently confirmed\r\n    by the patients’ statements that they “lost consciousness,”\r\n    it is a question whether these cases are not really cases\r\n    of deep stupor. According to Myers, the mutism is in nearly\r\n    every instance closely dependent on some form of stupor, being\r\n    generally the relic of such stupor after it has passed off.\r\n    Let the loss of consciousness be a profound stupor due to\r\n    the lifting or burial of the patient, then from this stage\r\n    there will be a transition to a state of ordinary stupor in\r\n    which intelligence is active but the patient is unresponsive\r\n    to stimuli. The patient is in a condition called by Myers\r\n    _excommunication_, in which the inhibitory process may be\r\n    regarded as protecting the individual against further shock. As\r\n    the stupor now passes away, it is natural that the inhibition\r\n    should appear lost in the case of hearing and speech, which are\r\n    two main channels of intercourse with others.\r\n\r\n    Dumbness is, by far, the commonest disorder of speech,\r\n    occurring in about ten per cent of shock cases in the first\r\n    thousand cases of shell-shock seen by Lt. Col. Myers.\r\n    Stuttering and jerky speech have occurred in about three per\r\n    cent. Loss of voice is rarer.\r\n\r\n    As against the view of Babinski, that mutism, being curable by\r\n    suggestion, must have been produced by suggestion, Lt. Col.\r\n    Myers argues that the stupor preceding mutism is the antithesis\r\n    of suggestibility and is, in fact, a condition of extreme\r\n    _autofixity_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNaval gun-fire effects on seaman: Aphonia. Two recurrences.\r\n\r\n=Case 264.= (BLÄSSIG, June, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA seaman from the _Derfflinger_ was brought into a naval hospital with\r\nloss of voice, December 22, 1914, able to speak only in a whisper. As\r\na child he had had diphtheria, but recovered without complication. He\r\nhad always had a very well-controlled voice. Early in December he had\r\nhad a cold owing to sentry deck duty in bad weather. Two days after\r\nthe shelling of Scarboro,--December 16,--while in the munition chamber\r\nof the big guns, he suddenly lost his voice. He had been greatly upset\r\nduring the firing of the guns. In two weeks he recovered speech.\r\n\r\nFebruary 12, 1915, he returned to the hospital with a complete aphonia.\r\nThis was immediately after the naval engagement in the North Sea.\r\nThree days later he was treated with electricity directly applied to\r\nthe vocal cords. March 20 he was discharged with speech completely\r\nrecovered. As soon as he went on leave, however, his voice was lost for\r\nthe third time, and he was still aphonic at time of report.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock MUTES observed, then DREAMED OF: MUTISM developed the\r\nSECOND NIGHT after shell explosion.\r\n\r\n=Case 265.= (MANN, June, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA volunteer of 20 was made unconscious for a short time by a shell\r\nexplosion, but was still fully able to speak when brought to the field\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nIn the second night after the explosion, however, he dreamed that\r\nhe had lost his speech. In the ward, meantime, he had seen a number\r\nof shell-shock mutes. Following this dream of aphasia, came several\r\nweeks of mutism, which then cleared up. According to Mann, this is\r\nexperimental proof of the psychogenic origin of a mutism.\r\n\r\n\r\nMortar explosion: Hysterical deafness.\r\n\r\n=Case 266.= (LATTES and GORIA, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA young soldier, a peasant, fell down unconscious when a mortar\r\nexploded killing several men. He regained consciousness a few hours\r\nlater but was deaf on both sides. He looked dazed and did not\r\nspontaneously move, having to be called for meals. Communicating by\r\nwriting, he could tell all the details of the accident.\r\n\r\nThe laryngeal and corneal reflexes were absent and there was a\r\nhyperesthesia and hypalgesia of the right side of the body. No\r\nanatomical basis for the deafness could be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion: Onomatopoeic noises in ears.\r\n\r\n=Case 267.= (BALLET, 1914.)\r\n\r\nA Zouave was with his squad at Tracy-les-Val Church, October, 1914,\r\nwhen the roof was burst in by a shell which wounded four men. The\r\nZouave felt a strange emotion with trembling, and whistling in his\r\nears. However, he helped his comrades into a neighboring car. From\r\nthat time forward, he was very emotional, and felt noises in his ear,\r\nsometimes humming, sometimes whistling. At Compiègne Hospital a lumbar\r\npuncture was made, perhaps with a therapeutic purpose, but this gave\r\nno results. The noises were heard as a whistling _pseeee_ followed by\r\na _boom_,--an onomatopoeia recalling the whistling and bursting of\r\nthe bomb. There was, in short, no labyrinthine lesion, but merely an\r\nobsessive mental phenomenon. There were no ear lesions objectively. The\r\nman developed a stuttering some time after the humming and whistling in\r\nthe ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nInjury of eyes by gravel from shell-burst: Photophobia, blepharospasm,\r\nfacial anesthesia, pains.\r\n\r\n=Case 268.= (GINESTOUS, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier of the Ninth Engineers, 28, a Beaux-Arts student, was\r\nwounded, December 19, 1915, by stones and gravel thrown in his eyes\r\nby a shell-burst. The eyelids swelled and the eyes filled with tears.\r\nHe was treated at the relief station and then evacuated to Verdun.\r\nThe edema disappeared in five weeks, but it was impossible for him to\r\nlook at light. February 2 he was evacuated to Nice, where he received\r\nthe diagnosis of traumatic keratalgia, blepharospasm, and photophobia.\r\nAfter eight days’ leave he went back to his corps; but the eye troubles\r\npersisted and he was sent to the ophthalmological center at Angers, May\r\n18, 1915.\r\n\r\nBoth his father, 67, and his mother, 58, were irritable and odd. Three\r\nbrothers and three sisters were also more or less neuropathic, and one\r\nof the sisters had been in a hospital for the insane with a persecutory\r\nmania. The patient had a daughter, fourteen months, well.\r\n\r\nThe man was a nervous, impressionable person, who wept at the slightest\r\nemotion. With an effort of will he could open his eyes, but if one\r\ntried to open them passively there was stout resistance. In the dark\r\nthe occlusion was not so complete. Both eyelids were wrinkled and\r\nfolded and made jerky, fibrillary movements. The conjunctiva and cornea\r\nwere normal (fluorescein test), but the palpebral conjunctiva was red\r\nand injected. The patient said he had subcutaneous pains recurring at\r\nirregular intervals above and below the left orbit, brought out or\r\nexaggerated by pressure; but such pressure had no effect upon the lid\r\nmovements. Visual acuity was normal, but the use of ophthalmometer\r\nwas impossible, as was measurement of the visual field. There seemed\r\nto be no disorder of chromatic sense. The reflexes could not be fully\r\nexamined; knee-jerks preserved. There was a zone of anesthesia to pin\r\nprick, less marked to heat, on the whole left side of the face. W. R.\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; burial; blow on occiput: Blindness.\r\n\r\n=Case 269.= (GREENLEES, February, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man in the third Wiltshire regiment was buried in a shell explosion\r\nand struck by a large mass of earth on the back of the head. When dug\r\nout, he was found blind. It was thought at the time that the severe\r\nblow at the back of the head had “concussed” the occipital cells for\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nSome months later the man was sent to Mr. Pearson’s home for blind\r\nsoldiers in London; but two months later was returned to Weymouth,\r\nunder Greenlees’ charge. He thought himself worse, since now he could\r\nnot see light at all. He had trained himself to take care of himself\r\nand steered confidently aside from obstacles in walking about. He was\r\nable even to learn the various colors by the sense of touch, according\r\nto Greenlees; thus, blue was diagnosticated against red: according to\r\nthe patient, a piece of colored card always had a rougher feel if it\r\nwas blue than if it was red. In fact, his work consisted of making\r\ncolored net bags.\r\n\r\nAs to the possible interpretation of such a case, see Case No. 433 (man\r\nwho could see large letters sometimes).\r\n\r\n_Re_ blindness, H. Campbell states that the number of cases of\r\nhysterical blindness appears to be decreasing as the war continues. The\r\nblindness he finds to be rarely an absolute one. As a rule, the vision\r\nis merely blurred or there is a contraction of the visual fields. The\r\ncondition is much less frequent than that of deafmutism.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hysterical blindness, Dieufaloy is cited by Crouzon as describing\r\na triad of conditions characteristic of hysterical blindness, namely,\r\n(_a_) sudden onset, (_b_) preservation of pupillary reflexes, and (_c_)\r\nnormal fundus.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock amblyopia (composite data).\r\n\r\n=Case 270.= (PARSONS, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nParsons describes a typical case of shell explosion amblyopia. After\r\nmore or less prolonged fatigue from marching and trench exposure,\r\nthe soldier is knocked down or blown into the air, and more or less\r\nseverely injured or wounded by concussion, fracture, bullets, or shell\r\nsplinters, losing consciousness, but perhaps not enough to prevent\r\nautomatic walking in a dazed state to the dressing station. Memory of\r\nthis phase is lost. The man is instantaneously stricken blind, possibly\r\nalso deaf; and possibly smell and taste are also lost. Blepharospasm is\r\nintense; there is lacrimation; the lids are opened with such difficulty\r\nthat examination of the eyes is almost impossible (nor, according to\r\nParsons, have the pupils yet been examined at this stage).\r\n\r\nIn a week or two the blepharospasm diminishes, and the fundi, which\r\nare found to be absolutely normal, can be examined. The eyes may be\r\nfound to be quite normal, the pupils reactive to light though perhaps\r\nsluggishly and perhaps unequally. Sight is now somewhat restored, light\r\ncan be perceived, and large objects distinguished. The patient can\r\ngrope about and usually does not stumble against obstacles. The fields\r\nof vision are markedly contracted, and more so than the avoidance of\r\nobstacles in walking would suggest.\r\n\r\nVision is eventually recovered completely. The right eye (the shooting\r\neye) is often more deeply affected and recovers more slowly. Perhaps a\r\ncentral scotoma may persist. Sometimes on manipulation of lenses the\r\nfull vision can be produced for the types. Parsons seeks to explain the\r\npsychology of traumatic amblyopia in the light of deductions of Lloyd\r\nMorgan, Mark Baldwin and McDougall.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock amblyopia (excitement, blinding flashes, fear, disgust,\r\nfatigue).\r\n\r\n=Case 271.= (PEMBERTON, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nPemberton calls attention to the following factors in a case of\r\namblyopia: First, excitement during a prolonged and somewhat critical\r\nattack; second, overstimulation of eyes and ears due to brilliant\r\nflashes, night firing from many batteries close together (the gunners\r\nare always subject to temporary deafness from this firing); third,\r\nnatural fear from close bursting of shells; fourth, disgust at\r\ndecapitated and disemboweled soldiers; fifth, fatigue from twelve\r\nhours’ work.\r\n\r\nThe artillery sergeant worked under heavy shell fire at Gun No. 1. A\r\ndirect hit killed three men serving No. 2 gun. The sergeant became\r\nsomewhat excited but worked his gun until the following dawn, when he\r\ncollapsed across one of the disemboweled corpses. He thus had been at\r\nwork for about twelve hours. The battery had fired 400 or 500 rounds.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, the man was conscious but very feeble and much\r\nshaken. There was amblyopia and contraction of the fields of vision to\r\nrough tests, but no change in color vision. Taste sense was blunted,\r\nand salt could hardly be told from powdered quinin tablets. Smell\r\nalso was practically absent, although he had never been able to smell\r\naccurately. Hearing was not more affected than that of other men in the\r\nbattery, and there were no tympanic fractures. Both thighs, from about\r\nthe apex of Scarpa’s triangle to the knee, showed partial anesthesia,\r\nsuch that a pin prick that should have been painful was felt only as\r\na tactile sensation, whereas lighter stimulation caused no sensation\r\nwhatever. The patient himself complained of numbness in these areas.\r\nThe gait was slow and spastic. The knee-jerks were brisk. Sent back to\r\nthe wagon lines for a week, the patient lost his sensory disturbance,\r\nbut the symptoms of mental distress increased. He walked weakly and\r\nstiffly; he continually thought of the dead men at the next gun, one of\r\nwhom was a friend. He was finally sent to a hospital in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock amblyopia.\r\n\r\n=Case 272.= (MYERS, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA private, 20, lay in the booking-hall of a station, October 28-29, not\r\nsecuring much sleep; motored in a bus next day to another place at 7.30\r\np.m.; went into billets at 8 p.m.; mounted guard 10-11.30 p.m. and 1.45\r\nto 3.45 a.m.; and went to the firing-line for the first time at 11 a.m.\r\nOctober 31. The platoon advanced through two sets of trenches, which\r\nwere full, and had to retire. About 1.30 p.m. they were found by the\r\nGerman artillery.\r\n\r\nThis man had been rather enjoying it and was in the best of spirits\r\nuntil the shells began to burst. The platoon was retiring over open\r\nground. He was kneeling on both knees, trying to creep under wire\r\nentanglements, when two or three shells burst near by. Three more\r\nshells burst behind and one in front. The escape was described\r\nby an eye-witness as a miracle. He managed to get back under the\r\nentanglements and into the trench, and shortly, as the fire slackened,\r\nrejoined his company.\r\n\r\nHis sight had become blurred immediately after the shell burst. Opening\r\nhis eyes hurt him, and the eyes burned when closed. The right eye\r\n“caught it” more than the left. At the same time, he was seized with\r\nshivering, and cold sweat broke out, especially about the loins. He\r\nthought the shell behind caused the greater shock, like a punch on the\r\nhead without pain. The shell that burst in front had cut his haversack\r\naway, bruised his side, and burned his little finger. This shell he\r\nthought caused his blindness.\r\n\r\nHe was led to the dressing station by two comrades, opening his eyes\r\nto see where he was going but finding everything blurred except\r\nimmediately after opening his eyes. There was no diplopia. Objects\r\nseemed to dissolve. He was weeping and worrying about becoming blind.\r\nThe horse ambulance took him to a hospital and thence to another\r\nhospital, and thence he went by motor ambulance at night to the\r\nstarting point, where he arrived five days after he had entered the\r\nfield. He could remember nothing about the ambulance trips. There\r\nwas a slight deafness which soon passed off. In hospital he shivered\r\nalmost incessantly in bed, and he kept thinking about his experience\r\nand the shell bursting. The shivering ceased November 3. No micturition\r\nfrom the afternoon of October 30 until the afternoon of November 2. No\r\nmovements of bowels from October 30 to November 5.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this soldier had been for two months in the Aisne\r\ndistrict, sleeping badly on account of lumbar pains and toothache.\r\nThere had been albuminuria, and the patient said he had failed to pass\r\na medical examination. The fields of vision were found to be distinctly\r\ncontracted. There was difficulty in taste and smell, which the patient\r\nsaid he had lost since the shell-burst.\r\n\r\nHypnosis was tried but the patient “insisted on resisting.” The\r\nsuggestions were offered during the concentration period. November 13\r\ntaste and smell began to return and the fields of vision were less\r\ncontracted. He was transferred to England for further treatment, and by\r\nNovember 27 had become much improved and not so “nervy.” February 1 he\r\nhad begun to attend hospital as an out-patient.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELL WINDAGE (NO EXPLOSION): Multiple affection of cranial nerves.\r\n\r\n=Case 273.= (PACHANTONI, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAugust 22, 1914, a French officer was leading his company to an attack\r\nand carried on, though wounded in the side by a bullet. Suddenly he\r\nfelt as if he had received a terrible blow with a hammer on the left\r\ncheek and eye and as if his arm had been torn off. He fell to his knees\r\nwithout losing consciousness. _There had been no explosion_, and none\r\nof his soldiers had been hit. He felt of his arm and carried his hand\r\nto his head to make sure of the wounds. There were none, but he was\r\nbleeding from the nose and the mouth. His left eye was closed and his\r\nleft cheek drawn “by an invisible hand.” His tongue had swollen until\r\nit had to be pushed out of his mouth. He was breathing hard. He fell\r\nupon his side without losing consciousness and he was carried by his\r\nmen to shelter in a trench. Placed on his back he felt that he could\r\nnot lift his head as “it had become too heavy.” His voice was lost.\r\nHe could neither cough nor spit. In order to get air he had to remove\r\nbloody saliva from his mouth with his finger. The left side of the\r\nhead was swollen. On opening his eyes he could no longer see with the\r\nleft eye. His cheek was covered with ecchymoses but without wound. A\r\nfew hours later he was made prisoner by the Germans. For two months he\r\nhad an increase of temperature every evening and for three months he\r\nlost his voice. Six months later there was still visual impairment.\r\nHe was anesthetic in the left cheek, unable to chew, paralyzed in the\r\nleft facialis region. There was alteration of taste, with atrophy of\r\nthe left side of the tongue deviating to the paralyzed side, and nasal\r\nregurgitation. There was continual drooling and convulsive coughing. In\r\ndorsal decubitus the head could be lifted with difficulty. There was\r\na kind of paresis of the esophagus, as he felt the bolus stop at the\r\nlevel of the third ribs so that with each mouthful he had to swallow\r\na little water. Apparently he had a paralytic state of the following\r\nnerves: optic, oculomotor, trigeminal, glossopharyngeal, pneumogastric,\r\nspinal accessory and hypoglossal. There was evidence of a slight old\r\ntuberculosis at apices. The man was slightly pale. There was an atrophy\r\nof the optic nerve and some retinal swelling. No pupillary reactions\r\nto light on the left side; but the accommodation reflex and sensory\r\nreaction were preserved. Divergent strabismus of the left eye. The\r\ntaste on the left side and on the anterior part of the tongue was\r\nslightly diminished. Diminution of galvanic and faradic excitability on\r\nthe left side of the face. No reaction of degeneration. Bitter, salt\r\nand sweet tastes altered. Left-sided atrophy of the tongue. No reaction\r\nof degeneration in the tongue and thyroid muscles although there was a\r\nmarked diminution in faradic excitability.\r\n\r\nThe author records this case of multiple lesions of cranial nerves\r\nas due to shell windage. Thirty-one months after the onset of the\r\nparalysis the cranial nerves, although manifestly regenerated, had\r\nnot regained conductivity. The officer was examined by Pachantoni at\r\nLouèche-les-Bains in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n_Re_ windage, see remarks under Case 201.\r\n\r\n\r\nWound of thigh: Claudication, vasomotor disorder, hypothermia, but\r\nno exaggeration of tendon reflexes. Under CHLOROFORM, ELECTIVE\r\nEXAGGERATION OF REFLEXES, _i.e._, in this case, hyperreflexia of\r\naffected thigh, including patellar clonus, after other reflexes\r\n(including conjunctival) had become extinct. The case described led to\r\nthe new formula of THE PHYSIOPATHIC SYNDROME (BABINSKI).\r\n\r\n=Case 274.= (BABINSKI AND FROMENT, 1917.)\r\n\r\nBabinski examined in August, 1915, at the Pitié, a soldier who had\r\nbeen wounded in the upper and outer part of the thigh. He showed a\r\nmost marked claudication with outward rotation of the foot. There was\r\na muscular atrophy of the thigh but no appreciable disorder of the\r\nelectrical reactions. There was a slight limitation in the movements of\r\nthe hip, namely, the movements of flexion and internal rotation of the\r\nthigh upon the pelvis; yet this limitation of movements did not seem to\r\nbe in proportion to the rest of the motor disorder. The X-ray showed\r\nno joint lesion. The right knee-jerk was a bit stronger than the left,\r\nthough this was controversial. Achilles reflexes were normal and equal;\r\nepileptoid trepidation of the foot, and clonus of the patella absent;\r\nthe limb showed marked and permanent vasomotor disorders and local\r\nhypothermia; both phenomena were of a sharp and definite nature.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the intensity of these vasomotor disorders, Babinski\r\nfelt that, in accordance with his general ideas, he was not dealing\r\nwith hysteria, and that he was in fact dealing with the so-called\r\nphysiopathic syndrome. Lacking for this syndrome was the exaggeration\r\nof the tendon reflexes of the affected limb. Might it not be that the\r\nimproper attitude and muscular stiffness of the limb were based simply\r\non retractions of tendons? The patient was chloroformed. This procedure\r\nwas the more warrantable as a number of physicians had thought of the\r\npatient as an exaggerator or even as a simulator. Under chloroform\r\nthere was in fact a slight tendon retraction; yet on the whole it\r\nwas clear that the attitude and stiffness of the limb were largely\r\ndependent upon a contracture. When during narcosis all the other tendon\r\nreflexes and skin reflexes had become extinct, there was still to be\r\nobserved on the affected side a hyperreflexia, and even a clonus of\r\nthe patella; and the clonus lasted an hour after recovery from the\r\nanesthetic. This curious phenomenon of elective exaggeration of tendon\r\nreflexes in narcosis, Babinski has observed to be not infrequent.\r\nIt is a valuable diagnostic sign for a sure proof of excess tendon\r\nreflexes in cases where doubt prevails under ordinary circumstances.\r\nSometimes the contracture will yield, but only in the deepest sleep,\r\noutlasting even the conjunctival reflex and the reactions to pricking\r\nof the normal extremities. Moreover, the contracture would return from\r\n20 to 25 minutes before any manifestation of consciousness. If an\r\nendeavor was made to reduce the contracture under full anesthesia and\r\nin complete unconsciousness, a spasmodic movement was provoked which\r\nexaggerated the abnormal attitude of the limb. Sometimes even the leg\r\nwould be thrown into flexor contracture.\r\n\r\nThe case above described was the one which led Babinski to his new\r\nformula of the PHYSIOPATHIC SYNDROME. This he describes in general\r\nterms as follows:\r\n\r\nThese disorders consist in post-traumatic contractures, paralyses\r\nor paretic states, but are not attended by any of the signs of the\r\nso-called organic diseases, either of lesions of the central nervous\r\nsystem, or of the peripheral nervous system, or of the great arterial\r\nsystems. In fact, these disorders somewhat resemble hysterical\r\nmanifestations. The underlying lesions appear to be sometimes\r\nextremely small; in fact, so minimal as to be out of proportion with\r\nthe functional disorders that they produce. These disorders do not\r\ncorrespond with any known anatomical regions, but they are singularly\r\ntenacious, and, unlike truly hysterical (pithiatic) phenomena, they\r\nare completely resistant to suggestion. Yet it is not merely in\r\nresistance to suggestive therapy that these reflex disorders differ\r\nfrom hysteria; for besides the contracture and the paralysis or\r\nparesis found in the different segments of the extremity concerned,\r\nthe complete Babinski syndrome includes also muscular atrophy,\r\nexaggeration of tendon reflexes, alterations of skin reflexes (even\r\namounting to areflexia), hypotonia, mechanical over-excitability of\r\nthe muscles with retardation of the muscular contraction; quantitative\r\nchanges in electrical excitability of muscles (excess or diminution\r\nwithout R. D.), mechanical over-excitability, and occasionally\r\nelectrical over-excitability of the nerves, disturbances in objective\r\nand subjective sensibilities (anesthesia and pains), heat regulation\r\ndisorders (especially hyperthermia), and disorder of the vasomotors\r\n(cyanosis, skin redness, oscillometric lowering at the periphery of the\r\nextremity in the presence of low temperature), secretory disorders, and\r\nvarious trophic disorders of the bony system, the skin, and the nails.\r\n\r\nDespite the permutations and combinations of these symptoms, according\r\nto Babinski they amount to a new group of disorders and represent a\r\nnosological species: a species of disease phenomena that lies midway\r\nbetween the organic affections and hysterical disorders. Babinski\r\nproposes the term _physiopathic_ for these phenomena, a term which\r\nexcludes the connotation of hysteria and all forms of psychopathia, on\r\nthe one hand, and seems, on the other, to express the fact of their\r\ncorrespondence to a physical material perturbation in the nervous\r\nsystem of a novel sort.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet wound of ankle: Contracture effect of chloroform.\r\n\r\n=Case 275.= (BABINSKI AND FROMENT, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man was wounded, September 1, 1914, by a bullet in the left ankle.\r\nContracture of the foot and of the four outer toes in extension\r\nfollowed, with a flaccid paralysis of the great toe. The left knee-jerk\r\nwas a little stronger than the right; the left Achilles jerk also\r\nappeared weaker but observation was difficult on account of contracture\r\nof the foot.\r\n\r\nChloroformed, October 22, 1915: There was no sharply defined\r\nasymmetry of the tendon reflexes. The left Achilles reflex appeared a\r\nlittle weaker. In the phase of muscular resolution, the contracture\r\ndisappeared entirely, but it reappeared a little after the return of\r\nthe tendon reflexes. The reappearance of the _contracture preceded_ the\r\nreappearance of _consciousness_ from twenty to twenty-five minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-typhoidal reflex or physiopathic disorder of right leg. Elective\r\nexaggeration under chloroform.\r\n\r\n=Case 276.= (BABINSKI AND FROMENT, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA typhoid patient, October 20, 1914, showed phlebitis and abscess of\r\nthe right buttock with contracture of pelvic trochanteric muscles. He\r\nwas sent to the Pitié on medicolegal grounds.\r\n\r\nSeptember 22 there was found a slight laxity of the patella tendon, as\r\nwell marked on the left side as on the right. The right side was more\r\ncyanotic, due to the inactivity of the limb. There was no edema. Tendon\r\nand skin reflexes were normal. The lack of power was diagnosticated as\r\npurely functional, and the report was rendered that the soldier could\r\nbegin to walk as soon as he desired. The two knee-jerks were noted to\r\nbe stronger and polykinetic, and the right knee-jerk appeared a little\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\nThe patient was chloroformed, October 25, 1915. Almost immediately,\r\nthe knee-jerks, Achilles jerks, plantar, and cremasteric reflexes\r\ndisappeared. During the first period of anesthesia, there was no\r\naccentuation of the reflexes, but at the beginning of recovery the\r\nanticipated reappearance of the _right_ knee-jerk was observed. This\r\nknee-jerk was already sharply defined at a moment when the left\r\nknee-jerk was still abolished. In a later phase of recovery, the\r\nright knee-jerk was very markedly exaggerated and a patellar clonus\r\nwas demonstrable on the right side. Even percussion of the _left_\r\npatellar tendon brought about a contraction of the _right_ adductors.\r\nThere was a true clonic and tonic spasm of these muscles. On the other\r\nhand, percussion of the right patellar tendon was able to provoke no\r\ncontraction of either right or left adductors. Nor was there at any\r\ntime any ankle clonus.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical lameness (bullet wound of calf) cured, but the associated\r\n“reflex” disorder (in the sense of Babinski and Froment) NOT cured.\r\n\r\n=Case 277.= (VINCENT, April, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA corporal was wounded by a bullet in the calf, September 8, 1914. At\r\nthe end of July, 1915, his lameness continued and he disliked to lean\r\non his left leg which bent under him. There was a slight atrophy of\r\nthe left calf. The lower leg could not be extended upon the thigh if\r\nthe foot was in dorsal flexion, and the dorsal flexion of the foot\r\nwas itself limited. There were no reflex, vasomotor or electrical\r\ndisorders. The man was given the usual treatment by Vincent and soon\r\nlearned to carry his body on either foot, and, being well disposed,\r\nspeedily abandoned his lameness, acquiring such skill in movements that\r\nhe became monitor over the other soldiers, watching over them in his\r\ncapacity as corporal.\r\n\r\nFor about a year he thus served as monitor, and when fully dressed\r\ndid not seem abnormal or look as if he were walking lame. However,\r\nafter walking, say 6 kilometers, rapidly, he dragged his leg; nor\r\nwas extension of the lower leg upon the thigh absolutely complete in\r\nhabitual walking, though he was able to extend perfectly if requested.\r\nDorsal flexion of the foot was also still somewhat limited, and the\r\nmeasurements of the two lower extremities at both calf and thigh showed\r\na persistent slight atrophy on the left side. He was then sent into the\r\nauxiliary service and did good work as draughtsman. In the winter the\r\nleft foot got cold rather easily.\r\n\r\nThis case is instanced by Vincent to support the contentions of\r\nBabinski and Froment that the truly “physiopathic” or “reflex”\r\ndisorders do not completely clear up in the recovery from the\r\nassociated hysterical disorders. That limb, which is the seat of\r\nphysiopathic disorder, is not in a state of meiopragia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoot trauma: Pains and dysbasia, hysterical; slight atrophy of calf,\r\nphysiopathic. Differential disappearance of hysterical symptoms;\r\nincrease of physiopathic symptoms.\r\n\r\n=Case 278.= (VINCENT, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nClovis Vincent examined a man who had been wounded in the foot but\r\nwithout injury to the bones. He was first examined in July, 1915, when\r\nhe complained of foot pains and was walking with crutches. The left\r\ncalf was smaller than the right (4 cm.). The tendon reflexes were\r\nnormal. There was no abnormality of electrical reaction. There was\r\nno proportionality between the trouble with walking and the organic\r\nstatus. A large part of the trouble appeared to be hysterical. In fact,\r\nupon treatment, the man was soon able to abandon the crutches and to\r\nwalk, though lamely. He was put into the auxiliary military service.\r\n\r\nHowever, the pains grew more marked and the lameness increased.\r\nIncapable of working, the patient was sent to the neurological center\r\nat Montpellier, whence he came to the neurological center at Tours\r\nin September, 1916. He had never been confined to bed, and had never\r\nceased his daily walking, aided by a cane. The walking disorder was\r\nvery pronounced. The patient said he was still suffering much. The\r\ndifference between the two calves was now 8 cm. and the thigh was\r\natrophied, though the atrophy had been absent in July, 1915. There was\r\nhyperexcitability of leg muscles. The right foot was colder than the\r\nleft. The hysterical phenomena, so pronounced in July, 1915, were now\r\nabsent, yet the reflex phenomena were sufficient to invalid the man.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock paraplegia may AFTER TWENTY MONTHS develop vasomotor and\r\nsecretory disorders: The whole to vanish on treatment.\r\n\r\n=Case 279.= (ROUSSY, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA foot chasseur, 22, a farmer in civil life, sustained shell-shock _à\r\ndistance_, June 2, 1915. He had no wound, but lost consciousness. He\r\nwas evacuated for “contusion of back” to a hospital June 4 to 12; for\r\n“contusion of back and _commotio cerebri_” to Portarlier, to July 21;\r\nfor “internal contusions and _commotio cerebri_” to Besançon, where he\r\nwas in three hospitals up to May 31, 1916, and the diagnosis “hysteria,\r\nold _commotio cerebri_ and trepidant astasia-abasia” was rendered and\r\npsychotherapy tried. The man was then evacuated to Saint Ferréol and\r\nthe diagnosis “hysterical paraplegia” rendered. He finally reached\r\nVeil-Picard in February, 1917, still victim of paraplegia.\r\n\r\nUp to this point there had been no signs suggestive of organic lesion\r\nof the spinal cord or any hysteroörganic intimation whatever. But in\r\nFebruary, 1917, besides the motor disorder there was a hypothermia of\r\nseveral degrees, with cyanosis and hyperidrosis of both feet, with a\r\nmarked diminution (and absence on one side) of the plantar cutaneous\r\nreflexes. The man was also victim of “hysterical pregnancy.” The\r\ncyanosis, hypothermia and hyperidrosis lasted six weeks.\r\n\r\nMarch 23 the man was given treatment and for the first time in 21\r\nmonths was able to stand and walk. The foot now turned from blue to\r\nred, and instead of cold became warm, even hot. In about a week the\r\nhyperthermia diminished, and, with the other troubles, disappeared.\r\nThere remained only a slight swelling of the foot and ankle joints, due\r\nto the painful exercises given the patient.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, that a hysterical paraplegia of long duration may\r\nfinally associate itself with marked vasomotor and secretory disorders\r\nand that these may be altered with extreme rapidity on the very day in\r\nwhich the hysterical phenomena are removed, and quite disappear in a\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTetanus clinically cured: Phenomena in part reproduced UNDER CHLOROFORM\r\nANESTHESIA five weeks afterward.\r\n\r\n=Case 280.= (MONIER-VINARD, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, wounded at Notre Dame de Lorette, May 9, 1915, by a\r\nshell fragment in the right popliteal space, was given a preventive\r\ninjection of 5 c.c. of antitetanic serum, evacuated to a hospital, May\r\n12, and developed signs of tetanus August 1, with trismus and pains and\r\nspasms in the right leg.\r\n\r\nThe disease progressed with dysphagia, stiffness and paroxysmal\r\nhypertonia of the legs, especially of the right leg, fixed orthotonus\r\nof the trunk, neck hyperextended, arms stiff but able to move.\r\nAntitetanic serum was given daily. At the end of eight days there was a\r\nmarked improvement and the whole course ran to approximate recovery in\r\n25 days from the onset of tetanic symptoms, at which time the man was\r\nable to get up and walk on a crutch. The external popliteal nerve had\r\nbeen sectioned, and the foot was in a marked equinovarus.\r\n\r\nChloroform was administered for the purpose of straightening the foot,\r\nSeptember 2, that is, about five weeks after the apparent end of the\r\ntetanus. The first stage of the anesthesia lasted about two minutes,\r\nbut at this point the trunk and leg muscles passed into a state of\r\ndiffuse contracture. In fact, a _tetanic syndrome_ took place _in\r\nthe midst of the anesthesia_. At a time when the corneal reflex was\r\ncompletely abolished, it was still impossible, with the exertion of\r\nthe greatest strength, to flex the segments of the lower extremities.\r\nMoreover, the trunk was stiffly extended and the jaws were in trismus.\r\nTonic and clonic contractions were produced by the efforts made to\r\nstraighten the foot, and these contractions passed from the right\r\nside to the left. The chloroform was now increased and a transient\r\nresolution of the muscles was obtained, lasting hardly more than a half\r\nminute. As all efforts to reduce the pedal deformity failed, anesthesia\r\nwas stopped. The contractures and paroxysms lasted a few minutes. The\r\nknee-jerks were extremely exaggerated and there was a bilateral ankle\r\nclonus. After a brief phase of excitement, the patient emerged from\r\nanesthesia, began to talk with his comrades, and ate his usual meal\r\nwithout inconvenience. The chloroform anesthesia had lasted twenty\r\nminutes, and 60 grams had been administered.\r\n\r\nIt was now determined to section the tendo Achilles and the tibialis\r\nposticus. September 8 the man was chloroformed again and the same\r\nphenomena were exactly reproduced. Sixty grams of chloroform was again\r\nadministered. The tendon resections permitted placing the foot in the\r\nproper attitude. Next day the patient was examined neurologically.\r\nThe skin reflexes were found normal. The Achilles and knee-jerks\r\nwere somewhat exaggerated, but equal on the two sides. There was\r\nno ankle clonus. Sensations proved normal. There was a mechanical\r\nhyperexcitability of the muscles of the anterior aspect of the thighs\r\nand of the calf.\r\n\r\nIn another case chloroformed 17 months after recovery from tetanus\r\nno such phenomena appeared. It would seem that the impregnation with\r\ntetanic virus or toxin must last in the nervous system a good deal\r\nlonger than the apparent disease clinically lasts, but that this\r\nbelated and concealed intoxication eventually passes.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena are perhaps _analogous to_ those of _Babinski and\r\nFroment’s_ so-called post-traumatic physiopathic or _reflex phenomena_.\r\nIt was following the special work of Babinski and Froment upon the use\r\nof chloroform anesthesia in detecting physiopathic conditions that\r\nMonier-Vinard made his observations in cases of tetanus.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock from falling of shell at a distance: Hysterical hemiplegia,\r\nterminating in brachial monoplegia. Case to show that the reflex or\r\nphysiopathic disorders of Babinski and Froment may occur without\r\nmechanical injury in the region involved.\r\n\r\n=Case 281.= (FERRAND, June, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier of the class of 1917 who never went to the front, while\r\nin training at Belfort, felt violent emotion on the occasion of\r\nthe falling of a big shell in the town of Belfort. The explosion\r\nwas a good distance from him. He lost consciousness a few moments,\r\nFebruary 23, 1917, and almost at once found himself unable to move\r\nhis left side. He was hemiplegic three months, but his leg shortly\r\nregained power. December 23 he entered a neurological center with his\r\narm flaccid and a paralysis affecting the shoulder also. There was\r\nan almost complete anesthesia of the arm terminating in segmentary\r\nfashion about the shoulder, and the whole of the left side was slightly\r\nhypesthetic, although there was no disorder of motion except in the\r\narm. The tendon reflexes of the left arm were exaggerated, and there\r\nwas even contracture upon percussion of the muscles themselves.\r\nPercussion of the thenar and hypothenar eminences produced movements\r\nof the hand. There were several vasomotor disorders. Percussion\r\nled to large vasomotor plaques, and rubbing of the skin produced a\r\nreddening which passed away slowly. The hand was red and cold. Slight\r\nelectrical hyperexcitability of flexors with feeble galvanic current;\r\nexcitation of the extensors not associated with any contractions of the\r\nantagonist muscles. Threshold lower for flexors on the affected side\r\nin the forearm. Half centimeter atrophy of the biceps. The forearm and\r\nhand were possibly slightly increased in volume from a blue edema of\r\nthe dorsal surfaces. The man was very timid, complained little, and\r\naccepted all treatment, which, however, was not very effective. This is\r\npresented by Ferrand as a case with physiopathic disorder in the sense\r\nof Babinski and Froment, though it does not present any sign of organic\r\nlesion whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell fire: Delayed shell-shock symptoms, sub-lethal, appearing in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n=Case 282.= (MCWALTER, April, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was picked up insensible in the public street and brought\r\nto hospital by ambulance, unconscious, breathing stertorously, pupils\r\ndilated, lips parched, unresponsive to stimuli, but without signs of\r\ninjury or alcoholism.\r\n\r\nThe pulse grew slower, the respirations more sighing, the heart-beat\r\nmore diffused and labored; but towards evening, about eight hours\r\nafter admission, he began to move the eyelids and lips, and muttered a\r\nresponse to the request for his name. After ten more hours, respiration\r\ngrew better, and Croton oil led to a movement of the bowels. Natural\r\nsleep intervened, and 18 hours after the onset of unconsciousness, the\r\nman woke up, and in the course of a few days became fairly well though\r\nstill dazed and confused.\r\n\r\nThis soldier had never received any definite injury in his war service,\r\nbut McWalter attributes his break-down to the effects of the constant\r\nshocks from the bursting of shells, and the scattering of shrapnel.\r\n\r\nMcWalter generalizes that a soldier, in the course of some civil\r\noccupation _after_ the war, might develop symptoms, even fatal\r\nsymptoms, and still the death in the case would be a direct consequence\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock symptoms, some initial, with recovery--others late and\r\ngradual, with deterioration.\r\n\r\n=Case 283.= (SMYLY, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier became blind, deaf and dumb, as well as paralyzed, as a\r\nresult of shell explosion. When he arrived at the hospital, he was\r\nable to see but had visual hallucinations. In a few days he recovered\r\nhis hearing. There was a fine tremor of the hands, controllable by\r\nsuggestion. There was an almost complete amnesia, but the patient\r\nremained able to read and write.\r\n\r\nThe pain persisted several months. The patient was physically well\r\nand seemed perfectly intelligent despite his aphasia and amnesia.\r\nOne night, he sprang out of bed, shouting, “The guns are coming over\r\nus!” and from that time forward was able to speak. Amnesia, however,\r\nsupervened for the months in the Dublin Hospital, and the patient\r\nbelieved that he was still in France. He also became unable to read or\r\nwrite, and was unable to recognize any letters except those he had been\r\ntaught to speak during his period of dumbness. Still later he got a\r\nflaccid paralysis of the legs. From seeming perfectly intelligent, he\r\nbegan to seem markedly deteriorated. Hypnosis with waking suggestions\r\nhad no power upon him. After a time, intelligence reappeared, but there\r\nhad not been any recovery of locomotion at the time of report.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds, gas, burial: Collapse on home leave.\r\n\r\n=Case 284.= (E. SMITH, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA non-commissioned officer went through the first eleven months of the\r\nwar in France and Flanders and was subjected to every kind of strain\r\ntherein. He was wounded twice, gassed twice, and buried under a house,\r\nin each instance being treated in the field ambulance and returning to\r\nthe trenches. Some time thereafter he was granted five days’ leave.\r\n\r\nOn reaching home, while waiting for a train, the officer suddenly\r\ncollapsed and became unconscious. For months thereafter, he was the\r\nsubject of a severe neurasthenia; “the whole of his trouble seemed\r\nto be due to the dread, lest on his return to the front, the added\r\nresponsibilities which would fall upon his shoulders might be too\r\nmuch for him.” He thought his intelligence had been numbed by his\r\nexperience. He thought his memory was unreliable, and that he could\r\nunderstand neither complex orders nor even the newspapers.\r\n\r\nAs to the reason for his maintenance of composure at the front, this\r\nmay be laid to the excitement, the officer’s sense of responsibility,\r\nand the example he felt he should set his men. This kind of case\r\n“demands a great deal of patient and sympathetic attention before the\r\nreal cause is elicited, and then months of daily reëducation to build\r\nup anew the man’s confidence in himself.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet wound of neck: Late sympathetic nerve effect.\r\n\r\n=Case 285.= (TUBBY, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Belgian was wounded, October 21, 1914, at Dixmude. The bullet\r\nwound was just below the right mastoid process. He was admitted to\r\nthe London General Hospital, October 29. He said that the bullet had\r\npassed into the tonsil, lodging there, but that on the third day, while\r\nvomiting, he brought up the tonsil with the bullet in it. There was in\r\nfact a large ragged wound at the site of the right tonsil. He could\r\nswallow fluids only, but articulated clearly. There was a question\r\nof injury to the following nerves: facial, glossopharyngeal, vagus,\r\nhypoglossal, spinal accessory, and sympathetic. None of these nerves,\r\nhowever, appeared actually to have been injured. The difficulty in\r\nswallowing was due probably to the faucial wound, and it is hard to\r\nsee how the pharynx could have been involved on account of the perfect\r\narticulation. November 3 the right sympathetic nerve was slightly\r\naffected; the right pupil was smaller than the left although it reacted\r\nto light. November 12 the patient left the hospital and nothing\r\nfurther is known of his history. Thus there was a late effect upon the\r\nsympathetic nerve thirteen days after the wound.\r\n\r\n_Re_ peripheral nerve disorders, see remarks under Case 252 (Tubby).\r\n\r\n\r\nFall from horse under shell fire: Crural monoplegia, hysterical.\r\nReminiscence? Autosuggestion?\r\n\r\n=Case 286.= (FORSYTH, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA patient of Forsyth had been exercising a high-spirited horse.\r\nArtillery fire close by made the horse leap sidewise, and the rider\r\nfell, his back striking the ground. He seemed to be curiously shaken\r\nout of proportion to the gravity of the fall. In a day or so, he lost\r\nthe use of one leg.\r\n\r\nHe recalled a rather similar incident: He had taken a hand in a local\r\nuprising in a distant quarter of the world. While he was escaping up\r\na mountain track, a rifle-shot from the enemy brought down his horse,\r\nwhich rolled over and threw him violently against a boulder, where the\r\nsmall of the back met the force of the impact. He felt intense pain and\r\nlost consciousness. Upon recovery he found he was paralyzed. At the\r\nend of several days, in a hiding-place in the rocks, he found himself\r\nstill unable to move his legs. The friend who had carried him to the\r\nhiding-place refused to leave him. He thought of suicide, but then\r\ndiscovered that he could move: at first, the big toes, then the ankles,\r\nthen the knees, and finally the hips. He was finally able to get into\r\nthe saddle.\r\n\r\nMoreover, years before, he had heard that a man who broke his back was\r\nparalyzed in the legs.\r\n\r\n_Re_ autosuggestion, Babinski remarks that suggestion may work\r\nin hystero-organic cases not precisely as in hysterical cases.\r\nAutosuggestion may here replace or accompany the ordinary\r\nheterosuggestion. Some temporary disturbance--a slight pain, a\r\ntrivial injury, or a mere bruise--may start up a complex process of\r\nautosuggestion in which it may be difficult to unravel the part played\r\nby the patient’s own reflexes, his previous experience and beliefs (in\r\nthis case, the reminiscences of a similar accident), the solicitude of\r\nhis friends, and the medical examination itself. Babinski believes that\r\nhysterical paraplegia or monoplegia never appears automatically under\r\nthe influence of emotion; never appears after the manner of sweating,\r\ndiarrhea, or blushing.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion; struck in cave-in: Symptoms in right leg (antebellum\r\nexperience).\r\n\r\n=Case 287.= (MYERS, March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private, 26 years old, had 11 months’ service and one month’s service\r\nin France. He arrived at a base hospital the day after his shock.\r\nConcussion had caused the dug-out in which he was standing to collapse.\r\nA beam struck him on the left side of the face, and pinned him to the\r\nground on his right side. A piece of iron fell on the left side of\r\nhis back, and his right leg was pinned by a cross beam on the back of\r\nhis thigh. He was dazed by the shock; was released and was able to\r\nwalk, but complained of a pain in the right groin and a giving-way\r\nof the right knee. The medical officer arrived about an hour later.\r\nA numbness, or state of no feeling, in the right thigh appeared, and\r\nincreased to the point of total analgesia to the level of the upper\r\nmargin of the patella save for a narrow strip in the mid-line on the\r\nposterior aspect of the leg. The only area of complete anesthesia and\r\nalgesia was on the outside of the lower half of the leg.\r\n\r\nAccording to the patient, it seems that about three years before, he\r\nhad been buried four feet deep in a brick yard, beneath a heap of\r\nclay. He had felt it most in the right leg, but the thigh had been\r\nmerely stiff and sore, and not numb. The patient admitted that the\r\npresent accident immediately reminded him of his previous experience.\r\nThere were no tremors or sensory disorders in the face, arms, chest,\r\nback, or abdomen. There was diminished sensibility to cotton wool of\r\nthe left buttock (across which a plank had fallen), and there was a\r\ndegree of hypalgesia of the buttock. The right thigh showed a degree\r\nof thermanalgesia and slight loss of vibratory sense. The corneal\r\nand conjunctival reflexes were diminished, and the knee-jerk was\r\nunobtainable on the right side. Three days later, there was a marked\r\nimprovement with almost complete return to normal, whereupon the\r\npatient was sent to a convalescent camp.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional subject, ALWAYS WEAK IN LEGS; shell explosion; wound of back:\r\nPARAPARESIS.\r\n\r\n=Case 288.= (DEJERINE, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Lieutenant, 25, was wounded at Arras about 10 a.m. October 20, 1914,\r\njust as he was leaning on another officer’s shoulder looking at a card\r\nin a chateau room. A shell burst in the court yard. A fragment came in\r\nthe window, struck him in the back and pushed him forward, whereupon\r\nhe felt pain in the back and a severe dyspnea, due to the gas from the\r\nshell. He lost consciousness several times and the dyspnea lasted for\r\nabout two hours. When he was picked up he could not walk.\r\n\r\nHe was carried on a stretcher to the ambulance at Avin-le-Compte.\r\nDuring the fortnight there, he was also several times dyspneic.\r\nStrength left his legs and he could only get about on crutches. There\r\nwas now a suppurating wound in the interscapular region where he had\r\nbeen struck by the shell fragment. Evacuated to Paris, he was operated\r\nupon on account of a tremendous abscess in the back, and the shell\r\nfragment and some bits of cloth were removed. The wound healed; but\r\nvague pains in the left thorax remained, especially when the man walked.\r\n\r\nOn examination, July 28, 1915, he would in the standing position hold\r\nhis legs together with the feet resting on their external borders,\r\nespecially on the left side. The toes were in plantar flexion, and\r\nthe soles were arched upward more on the left side than on the right.\r\nIn walking, the legs were always held in extension, the feet twisting\r\noutward. If an attempt was made to walk quickly, the man walked more\r\nand more upon the external borders of his feet, in such wise that the\r\nplantar surface and the heel turned up and became visible from above.\r\nHe would get tired after five minutes’ walking even if he spread his\r\nlegs out for a broader base of action. He could lift his legs only\r\nabout 10 cm. from the bed, but could flex and slowly extend his lower\r\nleg on the thigh. He could not adduct or abduct the feet. Movements\r\nof extension and flexion of leg on thigh were jerky and abruptly\r\nterminated, as also movements of thigh on hip. The patient could not\r\nsit, and when leaning forward he could not straighten up against\r\nresistance. The reflexes were normal. There was no sensory disorder.\r\nThe electric reactions were normal. Pupils normal. There was slight\r\nhypertension of the spinal fluid and a slight excess of albumin. There\r\nwere no lymphocytes.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Dejerine’s idea that these neuropaths always have\r\nantecedents looking in the same direction, it was found that he had\r\nalways been an emotional person, easily affected, sympathetic with\r\nother people’s troubles, given to weeping. As Lieutenant, he had not\r\nhad the courage to harangue his soldiers. He had often during his life\r\nfelt his legs weaken during times of emotion and had sometimes been\r\nunable to walk, though nothing of the sort had happened during the\r\ncampaign. He was sure he could get well, and wanted two months’ leave\r\nin order to get back to the front. There were no hereditary features\r\nin the case. A physician had told him that he had had meningitis. This\r\npossibly followed whooping cough. He had had orchitis after mumps at\r\n16. He had not had children, nor had there been miscarriages since\r\nmarriage at 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nWound near heart; delayed medical care; fear of having been shot\r\nthrough heart: Paraparesis (antebellum always “hit in the legs.”)\r\n\r\n=Case 289.= (DEJERINE, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 20, was sent as a Colonel’s bicyclist about 1 p.m.\r\nSeptember 30, 1914, with a message to one of the battalions. He was\r\nexposed on the way to shell and rifle fire, and was wounded by a bullet\r\nwhich entered 8 cm. below and internal to the left mammillary line and\r\ncame out in the region of the left hypochondrium. He crawled to some\r\nvillage houses 20 or 25 meters away. Another cyclist came to transfer\r\nthe order, but could not help him. A friend came to his aid but was\r\nstruck by a bullet 10 meters off and remained on the ground for an\r\nhour while the young cyclist lay behind a tree on the roadside. At 3\r\no’clock it was possible to take him to a house around which shells were\r\nraining. Shortly afterward the house caught fire. The man was evacuated\r\n6 kilometers to an ambulance in the night, and that night six of his\r\nwounded comrades died in the same room. The man had lost much blood\r\nand began to think that his heart had been hit. He choked, had violent\r\npalpitations, and intense thirst. By automobile next day he was taken\r\nto the railway station at Maison and was there for a day practically\r\nwithout food.\r\n\r\nThat evening, 36 hours after the wound, he was evacuated to Juivisez\r\nand stayed there one night in the temporary hospital. The hemorrhage\r\nhad now practically ceased. When he arrived next morning at Vincennes\r\nhe could hardly move, was unable to walk, had violent palpitation,\r\nprecordial pain, and two nervous seizures, with outcries and weeping.\r\nSeveral days later he could not walk at all or raise himself in bed. He\r\nwas operated on May 29; he afterward felt the same leg weakness and was\r\nstill unable to walk. Early in December, when observed by Dejerine, he\r\nwas able to stand on crutches with legs flexed, toes on the ground, and\r\nheels up. In walking he would scrape the ground with the dorsum of the\r\nfoot. The wound was now healed. Suppuration had been intense and the\r\nscars were extensive. Lying down, the man could move, though slowly,\r\nhis lower extremities in every way, nor was there any diminution in the\r\nstrength of his flexors and extensors. The patient in making movements\r\nagainst resistance would let go quickly and jerkily. The plantar\r\nreflexes were flexor but weak. There was no other reflex disorder, no\r\nevidence of sensory disorder, nor any sign of neuritis or arthritis.\r\nLumbar puncture gave a normal fluid without tension.\r\n\r\nThere were no hereditary features in the case. The man had been in\r\nchildhood nervous and irascible, rolling on the ground, crying and\r\nweeping when crossed. He had had three attacks of appendicitis--one at\r\n15 years and two at 19 years. After each attack he had felt weakness in\r\nthe legs. He remembered, too, that after his nervous crises on being\r\ncrossed, he had always felt this same weakness.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dejerine, these paraplegic neuropaths, like functional\r\ngastropaths, cardiopaths, and victims of urinary disorder, have had\r\nearlier spells of the same kind, though milder than the attack which\r\nbrings them to medical notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounds: Tic on attempts to walk; tremors. Recovery except for frontalis\r\ntic (ANTEBELLUM HABIT emphasized).\r\n\r\n=Case 290.= (WESTPHAL AND HÜBNER, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA substitute officer (mother nervous; always slightly excitable, easily\r\nfatiguable; had had a habit of wrinkling his forehead) sustained wounds\r\nSeptember 8, 1914, in the foot and thigh. The wounds healed well, but\r\nin the hospital he slept badly and had battle dreams. When he essayed\r\nto walk, he had contractions of face muscles. There was a lively tic\r\ninvolving both face and neck muscles, with the head pulled to one side\r\nand backward. This grimacing was but slightly influencible by the will.\r\nThere was a marked tremor of the arms. Gait was _trippelnd_. There were\r\ntremors of the whole body. There was also a slight hemi-hyperesthesia.\r\nThe tendon reflexes were very lively; vasomotor disorders (feelings of\r\ncold and perspiration).\r\n\r\nSeven months later the phenomena had all disappeared except for slight\r\ntic-like frontalis contractions.\r\n\r\n_Re_ heredity and soil, Mairet investigated 22 cases of Shell-shock,\r\nand found a hereditary taint in eight, and an acquired predisposition\r\nin nine. He found hereditary taint definitely absent in seven, and\r\nacquired soil definitely absent in six; whereas the rest of the cases\r\nwere doubtful. He found both the taint and the soil in five cases; two\r\ncases with hereditary taint alone; no case acquired, non-hereditary.\r\n\r\nIn eight cases with head trauma, Mairet found three with hereditary\r\ntaint, four without such; against one with an acquired predisposition,\r\nfour without such, others doubtful.\r\n\r\n_Re_ cases of somatic trauma (not affecting the head), among five\r\nexamined, there were none with hereditary taint, three definitely\r\nwithout taint, and five definitely without predisposition. According\r\nto Babinski, neither hereditary taint nor prepared _terrain_ needs be\r\nfound in hysterics.\r\n\r\nA predisposition is not thought important by Oppenheim, especially as\r\nso many normal persons are predisposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar strain (fatigue, emotion): Hysterical hemiplegia. Precisely similar\r\nhemiplegia ANTEBELLUM.\r\n\r\n=Case 291.= (ROUSSY AND LHERMITTE, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant in a regiment of cuirassiers was observed at Villejuif,\r\nJanuary 25, 1915. He had lost power on the left side as a result of\r\nfatigue and emotion, November, 1914. He had a complete paralysis of\r\nthe left arm and a paresis of the left leg. There was an anesthesia\r\nof hysterical type in the left arm, and also of the left leg as far\r\nas the middle of the thigh. He dragged his leg in walking (_démarche\r\nen draguant_: the toe is dragged along the ground, the trunk is bent\r\nforward, and at every step plunges somewhat toward the paralyzed side.\r\nThe patient is able to walk, however, by means of a cane or crutches.\r\nThis walk is characteristic of hysterical hemiplegia. According to\r\nRoussy and Lhermitte, the number of cases of hysterical hemiplegia\r\n(better, hemiparesis) is not large). The plantar reflexes on both sides\r\nwere those of flexion. Upon treatment (not specified), at the end of\r\nsix months he went back to service in the cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe point of note in this case is that this patient had had a precisely\r\nsimilar phenomenon on the same side, which lasted a month, at the age\r\nof sixteen years and a half. It is noteworthy that in this case there\r\nwas no traumatism and only the factors of fatigue and emotion to serve\r\nas an occasion for the hemiplegia. In fact, hysterical hemiplegia is\r\nsaid very rarely to follow physical trauma to an extremity. There are,\r\nhowever, some cases in which hemiparesis follows a slight head wound,\r\nparticularly if over the region controlling the paralyzed limbs.\r\n\r\nDuring the six-months’ course of successful treatment, no atrophy of\r\nlimbs appeared, and there was never any inequality of the reflexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good soldier (son of a tabetic sometimes hemiplegic), at 17 victim of\r\nhysterical hemiplegia, has AT 24 A RECURRENCE after two months’ field\r\nservice. “Functional excommunication” of left arm and leg.\r\n\r\n=Case 292.= (DUPRÉS AND RIST, November, 1914.)\r\n\r\nA cuirassier, 24, one month in the field, began to feel in September,\r\n1914, crawling sensations in left arm and leg; then fingers, later hand\r\nand forearm, and finally upper arm began to work awkwardly and feel\r\nheavy, and there was a little of the same sort of thing in the leg.\r\nHand and forearm were by the middle of October completely paralyzed,\r\nwhereas the arm and shoulder were only paretic. Anesthesia at this\r\ntime reached the elbow. The man had to be evacuated, after two months’\r\nactive and skilful field service, in one instance (September 19)\r\ncarrying out a clever and useful interception of hostile telephone\r\nmessages.\r\n\r\nIt seems that at the age of 17 also the man had had a left-sided\r\nhemiplegia, with sensory and motor symptoms, lasting two months, cured\r\nby electricity applied with a small electrode in his village. The\r\nwar situation was therefore actually a recurrence of the transient\r\nhysterical paraplegia.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the patient’s father, 52, an old tabetic, had also several\r\ntimes shown a hemiplegia (however on the right side), a phenomenon\r\nwhich had strongly affected his son.\r\n\r\nIt was curious that the slight residuals of movement which the\r\ncuirassier could perform could be made only while he was looking at the\r\nparts he was requested to move, and were impossible with eyes closed.\r\nThe anesthesia was a total one when observed in November, 1914, coming\r\nto a sharp and circular termination at the shoulder and garter-wise\r\nabove the knee--tuning fork insensibility in the same areas. The left\r\npatellar reflex was diminished when the eyes of the patient were\r\nleveled at the knee; but a surprise test brought the knee-jerk out\r\nnormally. The hand and fingers were a little darker in color, and the\r\nwhole left arm a little colder than the right. There was also a slight\r\namblyopia on the left side.\r\n\r\nThis hysterical paraplegia proved rather resistant to psychotherapy.\r\nThe patient seems to have systematically eliminated from consciousness\r\nand from action the entire function of the left arm and a good deal of\r\nthe left leg. Duprés and Rist speak of this as a kind of functional\r\nexcommunication of the parts.\r\n\r\n_Re_ relapses, Wiltshire remarks that the frequency of relapses and the\r\nways in which they are produced favor the conception that the original\r\ncause of Shell-shock must be psychic. Sir George Savage remarks that\r\ncases of Shell-shock should not return to the service under a period of\r\nsix months on account of the frequency of relapse. Others have recently\r\nargued that such cases should not be sent back to the front at all.\r\nHarris notes that relapse may follow so apparently slight a factor as a\r\nvivid dream. Remarks concerning the true nature of relapses are made by\r\nRussell. Russell, for example, disapproves anesthetics in curing such\r\na hysterical phenomenon as deafmutism. This sort of treatment does not\r\nget at the real cause of the condition, so that the man is very liable\r\nto relapse with the same symptoms. Ballet and de Fursac note the many\r\ncases of relapse after treatment and after discharge. Sometimes the\r\nrelapses were due to some unfortunate happening, but in other instances\r\nno external cause could be made out. Fear of having to return to the\r\nfront is a factor in certain cases, so that the true answer to the\r\nrelapse question may not come until after the war.\r\n\r\nRoussy and Boisseau insist upon the value of rapid cures\r\n(psychotherapy, electricity, cold shower, etc.), in diminishing the\r\nnumber of relapses. They maintain that these rapid cures abolish any\r\nchance for the man to brood over symptoms and thus to exaggerate and\r\nfixate them. These workers send their hospital return back to the\r\nregiments with a statement relative to diagnosis and the request that\r\nhe be immediately returned to hospital if neurotic symptoms appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar strain; burial: Deafmutism. ANTEBELLUM speech difficulty.\r\n\r\n=Case 293.= (MACCURDY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private 20 (always rather tenderhearted, disliking to see animals\r\nkilled; rather self-conscious; a bit seclusive; “rather more virtuous\r\nthan his companions”; shy with girls; sore throat a year or more before\r\nthe war, with inability to sing or talk; always a lisper) enlisted\r\nin May, 1916, spent five advantageous months in training and became\r\nincreasingly sociable. However, on going to the front October, 1916,\r\nhe was frightened by the first shell fire and horrorstricken by the\r\nsight of wounds and death. He grew accustomed to the horrors and five\r\nmonths later was sent to Armentières, where he had to fight for three\r\ndays without sleep. He grew very tired and began to hope that he would\r\nreceive wounds that might incapacitate him at least temporarily for\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nHe was suddenly buried by a shell, did not lose consciousness, but on\r\nbeing dug out was found to be deaf and dumb. On the way to the field\r\ndressing station he had a fear of shells. The deafmutism persisted\r\nunchanged for a month and then was completely and permanently cured in\r\nless than five minutes. He was made to face a mirror and observe the\r\nstart he gave when hands were clapped behind him. He was assured that\r\nthis start was an evidence of hearing; that his hearing was not lost,\r\nnor was his speech. He had no relapses during two months.\r\n\r\nAccording to MacCurdy, this case is a typical one of war neurosis of\r\nthe type of a simple conversion hysteria. The man never suffered from\r\nanxiety or nightmares.\r\n\r\n_Re_ burial cases, Grasset suggests that some of the patients probably\r\nthink that they have actually died; both sensation and motion have been\r\nlost, and it is naturally these that permit a man to believe that he is\r\nstill alive. The classical case is recalled, of the almost absolutely\r\nanesthetic boy who, with eyes closed, at once fell asleep. Foucault’s\r\npatient also said he actually thought he was dead after an explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar strain: Shell-shock and psychotic symptoms, with determination to\r\nparts injured ANTEBELLUM.\r\n\r\n=Case 294.= (ZANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nSeveral years before the war, a cavalry officer had a severe concussion\r\nof the brain after a fall from his horse, but got no manifest symptoms\r\ntherefrom except a mild transient deafness. There must have been a\r\nvestibular nerve injury, however, since there was a marked bilateral\r\nsubexcitability of this apparatus later determined.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1914, as the result of strains and privation in the\r\nfield, he got vertigo and lachrymose spells, with some obsessions as\r\nthough he would have to shoot himself in the foot or spring out at the\r\nenemy from the trench.\r\n\r\nIn hospital at Jena, insomnia, anxiety, excessive perspiration and\r\nsalivation, feelings of the death of various parts of the body,\r\nespecially the forearms and hands, associated with hypesthesia of the\r\nparts, were determined. He had a feeling of vertigo on walking and\r\nwas very sensitive to noise. He now developed a very intense and very\r\nvariable degree of deafness on both sides, diagnosticated as nervous\r\ndeafness. The caloric test demonstrated vestibular subexcitability\r\nabove mentioned. We may suppose that in this already injured organism\r\nfresh disorder had set in on a psychogenic basis in the same region\r\nthat had been injured years before.\r\n\r\n\r\nMine explosion; emotion at death of comrades: Unconsciousness eight\r\ndays with hallucinatory delirium; later, dizziness. History of previous\r\ntrauma to head with unconsciousness and dizziness.\r\n\r\n=Case 295.= (LATTES AND GORIA, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nSent at end of May to the front, an Italian soldier (Class 1895,\r\nlaundryman) was placed in an advanced post where he at once sustained\r\ngreat hardships.\r\n\r\nFather drunkard, mother healthy, sister nervous. Two brothers healthy,\r\none brother died of tuberculosis. Patient had scrofula, scarlet fever,\r\nand bronchitis (tendency to rave intensely when in fever). At four,\r\nsustained a trauma on the head (skull depression), dizziness, loss of\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nJune 7, a mine exploded in his vicinity, smashing several of his\r\ncomrades. He did not himself fall to the ground, but was overwhelmed by\r\na violent feeling of anguish. After a while, he lost consciousness. He\r\nwoke up at Bologna, June 15, as after a long sleep. During the interval\r\nhe had been in a state of intense hallucinatory delirium day and night.\r\nThen his mind began gradually to clear, first with amnesia of the shock\r\nwhich had caused the trauma. Then he recalled this fact too. Dizziness,\r\nhowever, grew in intensity so that he fell to ground many times during\r\nthe day. There were intermittent tremors in the limbs.\r\n\r\nUnder observation, August 7, a sturdy, robust man. Somewhat dull in\r\ndemeanor. Senses intact. Cranial nerves negative. Tendon and skin\r\nreflexes lively, especially on the right. Memory intact, except for\r\nabove-mentioned oniric delirium with restlessness and shouting at\r\nnight, especially while falling asleep and waking up. Frequent intense\r\ndizziness.\r\n\r\nThe condition remained unchanged for a week. Patient transferred to\r\nanother department, for acute catarrhal bronchitis with fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nSniper stricken blind in shooting eye.\r\n\r\n=Case 296.= (EDER, March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn Australian, 19, was admitted to hospital for loss of sight in the\r\nright eye. There had been a _right ptosis_ from childhood. January 7\r\nnothing could be perceived but light.\r\n\r\nAccording to the patient, he was sniping through a loop-hole, November\r\n15, when a bullet knocked a piece from the stock of his rifle. He\r\ncontinued at his post. There were five more shots, when another bullet\r\nstruck the sand around the loop-hole. His right eye began to water.\r\nHe shut the loop-hole and retired for an hour. His eye improved, he\r\nreturned, opened the loop-hole, braced the rifle, and found he could\r\nnot see the sights. He went to the physician. Vision grew rapidly\r\nworse, and in a few hours perception of light failed. He had been\r\nstricken blind in the shooting eye (the seat of a congenital deformity).\r\n\r\n\r\nAnticipation of warfare: Hysterical blindness.\r\n\r\n=Case 297.= (FORSYTH, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAnticipation of warfare may provoke a neurosis as in a case of\r\nForsyth’s. The man went blind training in England.\r\n\r\nIt seems that four months before, while mounting sentry at night,\r\nmarauding gypsies had felled him by a blow on the head from behind. He\r\nhad returned to duty after a day or two and was now expecting to be\r\nmoved to France. He said that while sitting with a friend, he began\r\nto feel giddy, turned a somersault, and fell unconscious; and that on\r\ncoming to, his mind was clear but everything was dark. For ten days he\r\nhad been blind, although once he could see his parents, who visited him\r\nin hospital, almost clearly. His appearance under examination strongly\r\nrecalled that of a blind man. He was induced to read some large print,\r\nthen smaller print, and finally very small print. He then lapsed into\r\nblindness.\r\n\r\nHe remembered that before enlisting, he had trained in a smithy, and\r\nheard that blacksmiths often went blind at the forge.\r\n\r\n\r\nBareback riding: Spasmodic neurosis (similar ANTEBELLUM episode).\r\n\r\n=Case 298.= (SCHUSTER, December, 1914.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 32, had to do a long stretch of riding bareback. As a\r\nresult, he later suffered from tonic muscular spasms whenever he had\r\nto exert himself seriously, especially whenever he had to move his\r\nlegs and when sudden movements or sudden strong contacts were made.\r\nThe attack appeared to be reflexly dependent on the pain. The case is\r\nregarded as one of the Wernicke _Crampusneurosen_, a disease somewhat\r\nrelated with hysteria.\r\n\r\nA condition somewhat like the one developed in the war had occurred in\r\nthis man at the age of seventeen after a drenching, but the attack was\r\nat that time much milder. He had, however, frequently had cramps in his\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTEBELLUM spasm of hands, functional.\r\n\r\n=Case 299.= (HEWAT, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA boy, 19, had been passed as fit for laboring work at home. He had\r\nbeen a farm boy from 14. Once at 17 he had developed whilst working\r\namongst turnips in wet weather, pain in the hands, which got worse and\r\nwas followed by pains in legs, arm, and neck, that kept him in bed a\r\nweek, and from work ten days. Even on returning to work, his hands were\r\nswollen, though he was able to drive a horse. The fingers had been\r\nsomewhat firmly flexed on the palms ever since this illness at 17.\r\n\r\nHe was sent to Netley after three weeks of army work, as having a\r\nspasm of both hands. He was found to be mentally below par, nervous,\r\napprehensive, stuttering in speech and not readily responsive, with\r\ndefective vasomotor control, though of good average bodily development\r\nexcept for asymmetry of chest.\r\n\r\nBoth hands were found firmly closed; tips of fingers applied to palms;\r\nthumbs freely movable; forearms well developed, especially the flexors.\r\nCounterforce was exerted upon passive extension of fingers. There was\r\nno sensory or reflex disorder, and while the patient was asleep, it was\r\nfound that the first and second fingers of both hands could be fully\r\nextended. Yet there was a definite contracture of the palmar fascia\r\nwhich prevented full extension of the third and fourth fingers. He was\r\nawakened by this test and the fingers became firmly flexed at once.\r\n\r\nThe man was treated by milk isolation behind screens, without\r\npermission to read, smoke, or talk. Twice a day he was encouraged to\r\nmove the fingers and made to perform finger exercises. He became able\r\nto extend the fingers over half their normal excursion in three days,\r\nand was then able to abduct and adduct the fingers. He was allowed up\r\nin two weeks’ time, with full diet and screens removed. The contracture\r\nof the palmar fascia was still in evidence, but the power of movement\r\nin the hands and fingers was so satisfactory that he could be sent back\r\nto duty in three weeks. The interpretation of Fergus Hewat is that the\r\npainful condition of the hands which set in in the illness at the age\r\nof 17, had caused an obsession which had developed into a functional\r\nspasm of the hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuarrel: Hysterical HEMICHOREA, DOUBLY REMINISCENT, of a former\r\nhysterical chorea, itself related with an organic chorea of the\r\npatient’s mother.\r\n\r\n=Case 300.= (DUPUOY, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA nineteen year old soldier, for some months a bit distressed and\r\nirritable, had a dispute with an old man whose jug he unluckily\r\nhappened to smash. The old man said something was going to happen to\r\nhim for that. That day, in point of fact, he fell and sustained an\r\ninjury with water on the right knee. He was upbraided by the captain\r\nand evacuated to the ambulance. The fellow thought the old man with the\r\nbroken jug had interfered, dreamed of the old man’s threats, and felt\r\nhis hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nNext day hemichorea developed on the right side, a partial and rhythmic\r\nchorea with jerky, regular contractions, fifty to sixty per minute,\r\naffecting synchronously the muscles of the leg, arm, face and tongue.\r\n\r\nDupuoy speaks of the reason for the hysterical “choice” of this\r\ndisease, since his mother had had a probably organic hemichorea, also\r\non the right side, with which she died at thirty years in a stroke. The\r\nboy was at that time thirteen years old and had had a rhythmic chorea\r\nsix weeks, limited to the extensors of the hand on the forearm, treated\r\nin hospital.\r\n\r\nThis new hemichorea was quickly and completely cured by psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHallucinations and delusions in a soldier, of antebellum origin.\r\nTreatment by explanation of causes.\r\n\r\n=Case 301.= (ROWS, March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private, 31,--a case of Capt. W. Brown,--was admitted to hospital\r\nsuffering from hallucinations of hearing and delusions of supervision\r\nby his family and friends; he heard his relatives telling him what to\r\ndo and what not to do. He thought they belonged to a secret police\r\nentrusted with the task of supervising his actions and seeing that\r\nhe did not again transgress as he had done. An inquiry into his past\r\nrevealed the following facts:\r\n\r\nHe had been a bank clerk before the war and once because of a nervous\r\nbreakdown as a result of drinking and smoking had been given a three\r\nmonths’ vacation. On this occasion he went with a prostitute--his first\r\nand only offence in sex matters. He later thought the behavior of his\r\nfamily indicated that they knew of his misdeed. He heard the voices of\r\nmembers of his family, became rapidly worse and more depressed, and\r\nattempted suicide.\r\n\r\nHe went to a private asylum. Later, he emigrated to Canada, but he was\r\nstill pursued by the voices and he returned to England. He enlisted at\r\nthe outbreak of the war and went to France. He was soon invalided and\r\nsent to Maghull.\r\n\r\nThe cause of his condition, according to Rows, was his affair with the\r\nprostitute and his previous drinking. This was explained to him as the\r\nbasis of his strong feeling of self-reproach. The hallucinations and\r\nidea of suicide had developed therefrom. Recovery “to a large extent.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA poor risk (hereditary and acquired); emotionality: Tremors and\r\nconvulsive crises with lowering of pulse.\r\n\r\n=Case 302.= (ROGUES DE FURSAC, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man, 36 (boat painter to 30 and thereafter a wine seller; paternal\r\ngrandmother insane, father alcoholic and suicide; gonorrhea, 20; two\r\nattacks of lead colic, 25 to 30; purulent pleurisy, 31; phlegmon of\r\nmouth, 34; also a chronic alcoholic), at the time of examination showed\r\narteriosclerosis and slightly hypertrophic liver; unequal pupils,\r\nslightly contracted and sluggish to light. He complained of frequent\r\nheadaches, possibly due to a combination of plumbism and alcoholism.\r\nHe was not in any respect demented, and had an excellent memory. He\r\nhad always been emotional, being unable to go to a funeral without\r\nmany tears, or remain in a house where there was a corpse without\r\nthreatening to faint. He was always overcome if he saw a fight going\r\non; and even in his wine shop he would escape when there was a fight\r\nand get a neighbor to bring the police.\r\n\r\nHe was mobilized on the fifth day, sent first to a territorial regiment\r\nand then, in October, put into the reserve of an active regiment\r\nand sent to the front. He reached the first line trenches in the\r\nnight, greatly affected by ruins he saw on the road. He slept poorly\r\nand had nightmares. At daybreak he woke up to see a pile of corpses\r\nnear by, and felt an indescribable terror on account of the corpses\r\nand the noise of bullets, machine guns, and shells. By superhuman\r\nefforts--according to the man--he mastered his emotions and took his\r\nturn at the observation post. Another sleepless night. Next day he got\r\nsuch tremors that his sergeant sent him to the hospital where he was\r\nat first thought to be suffering from a fever. But his temperature was\r\nfound normal, and he was sent back to the trenches.\r\n\r\nHe passed another night without sleep, and next day he could not hold\r\nhis gun for trembling. The Captain sent him back to be a kitchen man in\r\nthe rear, and here he remained six weeks--restless, trembling, eating\r\nvery little. He would have anxious spells. In the morning, as he was\r\ncarrying coffee to the men in his company, on seeing a pile of corpses,\r\nhe dropped his pot and ran back to the kitchen declaring that _whoever\r\nwanted to carry coffee might_, but he would not go back. He spilled a\r\npot of soup on his left foot. The Captain had him evacuated, saying:\r\n“Go! when you come back, I hope the war will be over!”\r\n\r\nHe was sent back to a hospital near Paris, where he was all right\r\nfor a few days, happy as a prince. The burn got well, and as the\r\ntime approached when he would probably have to go back to the\r\nfront, the terror returned. He had visions of corpses, and imagined\r\nbullets whistling, machine guns popping, and shells bursting. He\r\nwept, lost appetite, hid in corners, made three suicidal attempts\r\nby poisoning,--though the sincerity of these attempts was doubtful\r\n(zinc oxide ointment; rose laurel leaves; verdigris). Sent back to a\r\ndépôt before getting leave, he had crises of tremor with anxiety, and\r\nwas then sent to Val-de-Grâce on the mental service, and finally to\r\nVille-Évrard. He unhesitatingly confessed his terror, becoming more\r\nand more anxious and tremulous, and almost _losing his pulse_ while\r\ndescribing his experiences. He said he would commit suicide rather\r\nthan return to the front. He stayed at the Hospital, working in the\r\ngarden rather calmly, but when it was a question of leaving, even on\r\nconvalescence, his terror and anxiety returned. Every time he was\r\nexamined there was an emotional explosion, with expressions of anguish,\r\ngeneralized tremors and crises of clonic convulsions with respiratory\r\ndisturbance even of threatening suffocation, depression of pulse. It is\r\nthis latter which is the most important element in the proof that such\r\na case is not a case of simulation.\r\n\r\n_Re_ war cases, Bennati remarks upon the great number that do not fall\r\ninto known categories. There is, he thinks, an anaphylactic group\r\nin which the trauma acts as the secondary toxic agent; and there is\r\nanother group in which exhaustion works after the manner suggested by\r\nEdinger: that is, by a physiological overwork of certain structures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMartial misfit, dwelling on horrors of war at home; exposure; shell\r\nfire: Mental exhaustion with depression, emotionality, tachycardia.\r\n\r\n=Case 303.= (BENNATI, October, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian corporal, in civil life a writer (mother very nervous;\r\npatient himself rickety, unmarried; relatives well off), was in front\r\nline trenches for some fifty days. He was repeatedly excused from\r\nservice on account of fatigue, distress, poor appetite, insomnia,\r\ndepression and even confusion (aimless shots fired off in the night).\r\nIt turned out that he had been in just this state of mind when he left\r\nhome and family and that the very thought of war had seemed dreadful to\r\nhim. He did not at all enjoy leaves at night, as he stumbled and fell\r\nabout in the darkness and had shells burst near by. He lived immersed\r\nin mud. He reacted unfavorably to antityphoid injection.\r\n\r\nThe very day he went on winter furlough he greatly improved, but then\r\nsuddenly relapsed into depression, emotionality, inattentiveness,\r\nsluggishness of mind, and exhaustion. The tendon reflexes were lively,\r\nthe abdominal reflexes sluggish. There was tachycardia (120), the\r\nMannkopf-Thomayer tests were positive at 76 and 80, oculocardiac\r\nreflexes 84 and vagotonic. Stellwag and v. Graefe symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nHereditary instability.\r\n\r\n=Case 304.= (WOLFSOHN, 1918.)\r\n\r\nAn English soldier, 23, had been ten months on active service in\r\nFrance, when he was buried by a shell December 19, 1915. He became\r\nunconscious and later suffered from nervousness and stuttering,\r\ndepression, insomnia, frightful dreams, and tremor. Improvement was\r\nsuch, under treatment, that he was again returned to the front. A shell\r\nburst near him once more and again he grew dazed, trembled, had lapses\r\nof memory and fell into a state of general nervousness. He improved\r\nagain in hospital.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the front in a few days he saw a bomb burst some\r\ndistance away. He began to stammer and to wander about aimlessly.\r\nInsomnia, tremor of legs, arms and head, fatiguability, feeling of\r\nlassitude, occipital and vertical headache, fear of aircraft and\r\ncrowds, frightful dreams, absences and aimless wanderings appeared.\r\nThere was one attack of deafmutism. Whenever the patient saw aircraft\r\nhe ran. He was easily startled by noises.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of an excitable, alcoholic father and of a nervous and\r\nbad tempered mother. A sister had had nervous prostration. The man\r\nhimself had always been more or less moody and a nail-biter. According\r\nto Wolfsohn, 74 per cent of the war neuroses have a family history\r\nof neurotic or psychotic stigmata, including insanity, epilepsy,\r\nalcoholism and nervousness; 72 per cent show previous neuropathy.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wolfsohn, wounded soldiers do not show war neuroses\r\nexcept in rare instances. In the wounded soldiers studied by him no\r\nneuropathic or psychopathic stigmata occurred in the family history and\r\nprevious neuropathic tendencies in the patients themselves were found\r\nin about 10%.\r\n\r\nA soldier that is excessively fatigued or has been under undue mental\r\nanxiety, expecting to be blown to pieces, may go into psychoneurosis\r\nmore easily than one without such emotional strain.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenealogical tree of a shoemaker.\r\n\r\n=Case 305.= (WOLFSOHN, 1918.)\r\n\r\nAn English private, shoemaker, 37, was partially buried in a shell\r\nexplosion and came to, stupid, shaky, weak and fearful of the dark.\r\nTwice, in a dazed state, he attempted to murder companions and was\r\nafterwards amnestic. He had always been of a violent temper and his\r\noutbursts had been followed by petit mal. He had also always been\r\nafraid of the dark. One of his children had fits; three were hysterical\r\nand had temper fits. The man’s father was in an insane hospital.

During\r\nan attack, he fell from his horse without losing consciousness, though\r\nhe was at the time much afraid of being crushed. The attack ceased and\r\nhe returned to the lines on horseback.\r\n\r\nImmediately there developed an emotional crisis, and thereafter he\r\nbroke into weeping on the slightest occasion. He was afraid he was\r\ngoing to lose his reason; that some spiritual power was going to\r\nsuppress his ego and madden him. He wept as he was going under narcosis\r\nto be operated upon for an intercurrent appendicitis. He became so\r\nsensitive to noise that he wanted to choke the offender. One day he bit\r\nhimself on the arm in his excitement. Sensory tests could not be executed\r\non account of his fear of the brush. Reflexes were normal.\r\n\r\nIt took four hypnotic seances to get him in proper rapport with his\r\nphysician for psychotherapy.\r\n\r\nThis case is cited by Donath as one in which traumatic hysteria has been\r\nproven to exist in a man without any sign of neuropathic or psychopathic\r\ntaint, either in his previous history or in his relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nA perfect soldier type. Mine explosion; burial; superficial wounds: War\r\nneurosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 307.= (MACCURDY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant, 29, had been a regular soldier for eight years before\r\nthe war and was made a non-commissioned officer almost at once after\r\nenlisting. He went out as a sergeant with the original expeditionary\r\nforce and got through the retreat from Mons and the first battle of\r\nYpres intact. He enjoyed the fighting hugely and even got indifferent\r\nto the burial work. The death of chums saddened him, but he carried on\r\nand soon forgot about the incidents. He might be regarded as a perfect\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1915, there was a slight touch of rheumatism. Two or three\r\nmonths later the Germans exploded a mine immediately in front of the\r\ntrench where he was. He went pale for the first time in his life, but\r\nkept his men “standing to.” Thereafter he began to think for the first\r\ntime about danger. Mining was hereabouts the chief form of attack, and\r\nhe frequently heard Germans digging beneath a dug-out. He slept well in\r\nbillets, but was too restless for sleep on active duty.\r\n\r\nHe got more and more on edge during the next weeks. Six weeks after\r\nthe mine explosion he was buried in a dug-out. Though he did not\r\nlose consciousness, he was dazed and had to lie down for two hours.\r\nNervousness, chronic headache and insomnia, even in billets, followed.\r\nHis imagination played upon the blowing out of dug-outs and the bowling\r\nover of men by shells. He had become company sergeant-major and the\r\nresponsibility made him grow worse and worse. At times he tended to\r\njump when the shells came, but was outwardly perfectly calm. He began\r\nto take morphia, though with little result. He had suicidal thoughts.\r\n\r\nAfter two months of these symptoms he was sent to England. He began\r\nto sleep fairly well and three months later applied for light duty;\r\nwas greatly bored by the company accountant work given him; got a\r\ncommission and was sent back to the front nine months later, January,\r\n1917. He got on with the active fighting very well, sleeping four or\r\nfive hours a night. In April he was sent to Arras. He had had a dream\r\nthat he was going to be bowled over, buried and wounded in the neck.\r\nSleep got poorer. In April he led his men in an advance and actually\r\nwas bowled over, buried and hit in the neck as well as in the knee and\r\nthe hand, though all the wounds were superficial. He was carried back,\r\ndazed, to hospital, where he grew fairly comfortable in ten days and\r\neven undertook a journey down to the base.\r\n\r\nHe arrived in collapse, remained in camp at the base three weeks,\r\ngetting steadily worse. Something, he could not tell what, was going to\r\nhappen and kill him. He could not concentrate, even to read. He thought\r\nof suicide. He slept practically not at all, waking from a doze with a\r\nstart, feeling that something had hit him. He had dreams of being taken\r\nprisoner and on waking would in fancy start a fight to escape from\r\nimagined imprisonment back to the British lines. After two weeks in\r\nvarious hospitals he spent ten days in a hospital for nervous cases and\r\ngrew better. Riding on trains he was terrorized in every tunnel lest he\r\nshould be crushed.\r\n\r\nAccording to MacCurdy, an anxiety neurosis would have developed had\r\nnot his superiors sent the lieutenant back to hospital after the final\r\nburial in April. As this perfect soldier said: “_There is no man on\r\nearth who can stick this thing forever_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; thrown against a wall: Tremors--TREMOPHOBIA.\r\n\r\n=Case 308.= (MEIGE, February, 1916.)\r\n\r\nMeige has studied shell-shock tremors, especially those occurring\r\nwithout external wound.\r\n\r\nA corporal was with his squad on the Nouvron Plateau, January 13, 1915,\r\nwhen he was thrown against the wall by a bursting shell, which killed\r\nor wounded several comrades but did not wound the corporal. Whether\r\nhe lost consciousness is unknown, but he lay on the ground for some\r\ntime, until he could be moved through a communication trench. After\r\nthe explosion he began to tremble, and was still trembling on his trip\r\nback. Constantly trembling, he lived on at the front for a fortnight,\r\nbut without eating; and, although he had been a good rifleman, he had\r\nlost all his former skill with a gun.\r\n\r\nThere was a delay of a month before evacuation, but the trembling did\r\nnot cease, and he was passed through various units, to the neurological\r\ncenter at Villers-Cotterets, where he remained for two months,--April\r\n13 to June 15, 1915,--with a diagnosis of hysterical chorea. He was\r\nexamined by Guillain, who found, besides the generalized tremors,\r\nlively knee-jerks and Achilles jerks, an excessive emotionality,\r\nparticularly marked when the guns were going or bombs bursting. Lumbar\r\npuncture yielded a perfectly normal fluid.\r\n\r\nJune 19 the corporal went to the Salpêtrière under P. Marie. July 14 he\r\nwas evacuated to the civil hospital of Arcueil, where he remained till\r\nSeptember 24, when he was sent home to convalesce, from October 26 to\r\nDecember 15.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the Salpêtrière December 15, 1915. Throughout these\r\nvarious movements from hospital to hospital, his status was unchanged.\r\nAt the time of report about a year after shell-shock, he was still\r\nconstantly and uniformly trembling. All four limbs were affected,\r\nperhaps the right arm and the left leg more markedly. There was no\r\ntremor during sleep, but there was a tremor when the patient lay awake\r\nin dorsal decubitus just as when he was sitting or standing. The tremor\r\nwas worse in the evening than in the morning, and the patient could\r\nget to sleep only very late. There was slight tremor of the head; the\r\neyelids and the tongue showed a few tremors, which were not synchronous\r\nwith those of the limbs. Nystagmus was absent. To diminish the effect\r\nof the trembling, the patient held his forearms flexed and kept his\r\nelbows close to his body. If the trembling of the legs got intense, the\r\npatient would rise and walk a few steps. Any movement, such as carrying\r\na spoon or a glass to the mouth, led to an exaggeration of the tremors;\r\nand there was at this time a suggestion of the intention tremor of\r\nmultiple sclerosis. The tremor was increased when the eyes were closed.\r\nAny sudden noise or sharp command, or recalling to mind of trench\r\nservice, would bring about extraordinary motor crises, in which there\r\nwas an intense and generalized tremor, so the patient would lose his\r\nbalance. Any attempt at eliciting reflexes would produce generalized\r\nviolent tremor. Sensations were normal; tendency to hyperidrosis; pulse\r\nin repose, 60, rising to 120 if one struck the table sharply.\r\n\r\nMeige remarks that a number of examples of tremors suggestive of\r\nParkinson’s disease were observed in the War of 1870. Might the\r\nexplosion have caused properly situated lesions in the encephalon of\r\nsuch a nature as to produce a Parkinsonian tremor? The tremors were\r\nstationary, and if due to some lesion, the lesion remains now exactly\r\nwhat it was at the beginning. There was no digital tremor such as is\r\ncharacteristic of Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, the intention tremor\r\nof such a patient, rather than Parkinson’s disease, suggests multiple\r\nsclerosis, of which latter disease, however, there is no other sign.\r\nNor does there seem any evidence that these tremors were of cerebellar,\r\nparetic, goitrous, or of any definite toxic origin. On the whole, Meige\r\nregards it as a neuropathic manifestation resembling what is found in\r\ntraumatic neurosis. He believes that there is not sufficient evidence\r\nthat it is the consequence of any structural change in the nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nMeige remarks that the analysis of any case of tremor must take the\r\nmental state into account. This patient, perfectly conscious of his\r\ntremors and their critical exacerbations, was much chagrined thereby.\r\nHe suffered mentally from his impotence, especially when bystanders\r\nwould intentionally bring about his paroxysms. He looked like one\r\nshuddering from fear, and it is actually probable that he was afraid\r\nof his own tremors and shuddering. He was, besides subject to tremor,\r\nalso a victim of tremophobia,--a kind of phobia described some years\r\nsince by Meige, somewhat resembling ereutophobia, or fear of blushing,\r\ndescribed by Pitres and Régis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour hours in a freezing bog: Hysterical glossolabial hemispasm twelve\r\nhours after rescue. No sensory disorder of face or tongue; sensory\r\ndisorder of arm, but no motor disorder.\r\n\r\n=Case 309.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man, 27, in good health, called on the second day of the\r\nmobilization, got into the line two weeks from mobilization, first in\r\nthe West, and then, from mid-September, in the East. He was in the\r\nartillery and stood shell fire in a big battle very well.\r\n\r\nHowever, December 27, 1914, while engaged in transport service, on\r\nthe way back with his horse, he fell into a bog and gradually sank to\r\nhis neck. Attempts to get the man and his horse out failed. All that\r\nsaved him from drowning was the freezing of the bog surface. After\r\nfour hours he was freed by his comrades, apparently frozen stiff, but\r\nwith consciousness completely preserved. On the next day, at about\r\nfive o’clock,--twelve hours after his release from the frozen bog,--he\r\nhad a seizure. It began with headache on the left side and loss of\r\nconsciousness that lasted 24 hours. The right leg was paralyzed and\r\nvery painful. He passed through various hospitals and finally arrived\r\nat the Jena Nerve Hospital, January 25, 1915.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, powerful man, with a slow regular pulse, accelerated\r\nheart sounds, lively dermatographia, increased muscular excitability,\r\ngeneral increase of knee and Achilles reflexes (left greater than\r\nright), slight patellar and ankle clonus present on the left side,\r\nBabinski reaction absent, plantar reflex more lively on the left than\r\non the right, but abdominal reflex more lively right than left. Head\r\npainful to percussion in the left temporal region. Touch and pain sense\r\nsegmentally absent in both right extremities. Arm movements free;\r\ntremors absent. Active movements almost impossible in the right leg;\r\non passive movement marked pain. Slight muscular tension about knee-,\r\nhip-, and ankle-joints. The patient got about with a cane, trailing\r\nthe left leg. Romberg sign.\r\n\r\nThe right angle of the mouth was withdrawn slightly upward and outward,\r\nand lagged a little in active movements. The protruded tongue deviated\r\ncompletely into the right angle of the mouth and there remained, but\r\nwithout tremor. The uvula deviated to the right, and the right palate\r\nwas held higher than the left. Lively palatal reflex. Speech intact.\r\nThe patient’s chief complaint was attacks of coughing, which increased\r\nhis headache to the point of intolerability. A harmless drug caused\r\nthe coughing and headache to disappear. The patient was a quiet,\r\nwilling man, who industriously went through his exercises, and on the\r\nKaiser’s birthday was already walking in the marketplace. His tongue\r\ncontractions gradually improved. His body-weight increased.\r\n\r\nIn the course of two months the glossolabial and palatal contractions\r\nhad largely disappeared. The walking movements of the right leg had\r\nimproved, although there was still a distinct paresis, and a stiffness\r\nin the right knee and ankle joints. Climbing stairs was impossible\r\non account of difficulty at the hip. March 30, 1915, the sensory\r\nimprovement was marked. There was a feeling as though the last three\r\nfingers of the hand were asleep; walking was improved; he could walk\r\none or two hours a day. The walk was still slightly spastic-paretic,\r\nMay 28, when he was discharged.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the hysterical attack had such a long incubation\r\nperiod in this case: twelve hours after his removal from the marsh.\r\nThere were doubtless physical factors of refrigeration, on the one\r\nhand, and on the other, psychic factors of fear of sinking alive in\r\nthe marsh, at the bottom of the phenomenon. The most marked feature,\r\nof course, was the glossolabial hemispasm. In the presence of this\r\nhemispasm, it is remarkable that there should have been no anesthesia\r\nor analgesia of the face, cheek, or tongue; and moreover the paresis of\r\nthe right mouth and tongue was far less marked than the contracture.\r\nIt is also striking that the right upper extremity, although it had\r\nsensory disorder, failed to show motor disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlight bruise by horse: Apparently invincible complaints of pain. Cure\r\nby single-handed capture of many Russians.\r\n\r\n=Case 310.= (LOEWY, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman was standing below an embankment when a horse fell upon\r\nhim, bruising him slightly on the left hip. This infantryman later\r\ncontinually complained of pains in the opposite hip though there had\r\nnever been a contusion there, nor anything felt there. These complaints\r\ncould not be influenced by exhortation, by diversion, or by drugs. If\r\nthey were purposely ignored, the patient reacted complainingly and in a\r\nway to suggest delusions of persecution.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this querulous man soon proved an effective soldier in\r\na storming attack in which the whole battalion distinguished itself,\r\nputting himself forward particularly. In fact, by himself he captured a\r\nwhole group of Russians!\r\n\r\nThereupon all the pains in the hip ceased, nor did they recur so long\r\nas he was under observation. Morose and complaining before, he now\r\nbecame cheerful.\r\n\r\n\r\nKick in abdomen by horse: General spasticity; tremors; eye symptoms\r\n(_e.g._ monocular diplopia); convulsions. Improvement.\r\n\r\n=Case 311.= (OPPENHEIM, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA cuirassier was kicked by a horse on left side of abdomen, November\r\n24, and lost consciousness. A month later, in hospital, hardness and\r\ntenderness to pressure of abdominal wall, _spastic muscles_ everywhere,\r\npseudospastic tremor of legs, and complaints of double vision were\r\nnoted. He also had attacks of convulsions, in which he became\r\nunconscious, twitchings appeared, but the tongue was not bitten. Urine\r\nwas often involuntarily passed in these attacks, but he was not always\r\ncontinent outside attacks, as, for instance, in coughing.\r\n\r\nOn admission to nerve hospital: Right-sided monocular diplopia;\r\nmild ptosis; ocular movements free. Rapid tremor on shaking hands.\r\nStood with straddling legs affected by vibrating tremor. Knee-jerks\r\nconsiderably increased. In the dorsal position movements of the left\r\nleg were accompanied by marked tremor. He even could not go to sleep\r\neasily on account of twitching of the left leg.\r\n\r\nHis comrades observed that he had convulsions at night, and often\r\nspoke in his sleep. Inoculation against typhoid fever was made early\r\nin December. Later, permanent rise of temperature to 37.8. Several\r\nattacks, lasting about ten minutes, came under observation of the\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nIn January, progressive improvement in the motor sphere and also\r\npsychically. The urinary disturbance likewise disappeared, but the\r\nspasms persisted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWindage from a shell; fear; fall, unconscious: Homonymous hemianopsia\r\n(organic? functional?) with blinking and vasomotor excitability.\r\n\r\n=Case 312.= (STEINER, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA volunteer, 19 (never ill; no nervous disease in the family) after a\r\nperiod of training went into the field October 3, 1914. November 5 a\r\nshell struck near his trench, but failed to explode. Up to that time\r\neverything had been quiet. The soldier had been looking out of the\r\nloop-hole, surveying the landscape. He felt a great fear, felt a blow\r\nin the neck, and fell down unconscious. How long he was unconscious is\r\nunknown. Sometime later he walked back with his comrades.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later, this volunteer--who was a very intelligent young\r\nman, possessing some knowledge of biology, including the nature of\r\nvisual fields--noticed a black spot in the field of vision, which\r\ncame and went, but after a few hours remained continually without\r\ndisappearing. Otherwise there was no complaint except a feeling of\r\ndizziness when stooping.\r\n\r\nUpon examination there could be found no disorder of the internal\r\norgans. Neurologically there was blinking, vasomotor excitability,\r\nslight reddening of the face, and dermatographia. An expert in\r\nophthalmology confirmed the existence of a homonymous defect in the\r\nfields of vision. This defect could not be influenced by suggestion or\r\nby any other treatment, nor did any other change whatever occur in the\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nSteiner inquires whether this hemianopsia is to be taken as organic\r\nor functional. The air-pressure of the shell hissing past might have\r\nproduced a concussion, or the falling unconscious might have produced\r\na _commotio cerebri_ or a slight hemorrhage. The tic-like blinking and\r\nvasomotor excitability, however, suggest functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock PSORIASIS. Post-traumatic eczema.\r\n\r\n=Case 313.= (GAUCHER AND KLEIN, May, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 28, came to the Saint-Louis skin clinic, May 15, 1916, for\r\nleg lesions three months old. These lesions were cicatricial, squamous,\r\nirregular-contoured, and had developed following a wound. The lesions\r\nwere eczematous.\r\n\r\nOn the trunk, arms and elbow were lesions of psoriasis. These lesions\r\nhad appeared after shell-shock. The man had been bowled over June\r\n16, 1915, by a _marmite_. The psoriatic lesions appeared shortly\r\nafterwards. The patient had never seen anything of the sort before.\r\n\r\nIn this case the trauma provoked eczema; the emotion, psoriasis.\r\nGaucher and Klein say that they have been struck by the recrudescence\r\nof psoriasis since the outbreak of the war, and remark, also, that\r\nthere has been a relative increase of new cases since July, 1914.\r\n\r\nThere are cases of psoriasis following nervous shock, emotion and\r\ntrauma. Sometimes the psoriatic lesion develops upon the scar of a\r\nwound. In the above case, as in the case of a woman of 25, a refugee\r\nfrom the Arras bombardment, the psoriasis began _de novo_ and slowly\r\ndeveloped immediately after the catastrophe of the Jena. Five, possibly\r\nsix, out of eight cases totaled, appear, unlike the case sketched\r\nabove, to have developed in cases either tuberculous or of tuberculous\r\nstock.\r\n\r\n_Re_ psoriasis, Vignolo-Nutati remarks that this is a relatively\r\nfrequent skin disease amongst Italian soldiers. He states that many\r\nof these cases are due to nervous shock. Some are related to wounds\r\nappearing near the scars. In all cases an emotional disturbance is the\r\nchief cause. Vignolo-Nutati had 86 cases of psoriasis in six months, 52\r\nof the men coming from the front. Eighteen of the men said that they\r\nhad not previously suffered from the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sergeant gets the CROIX DE GUERRE and SHELL-SHOCK together: Transient\r\ndeafness; later pseudohallucinatory electric bell ringing, reminiscent\r\nof civilian work; stereotyped movements, reminiscent of war experience.\r\n\r\n=Case 314.= (LAIGNEL-LAVASTINE AND COURBON, May, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant, 24, had worked about Parisian hotels from the age of\r\nthirteen and a half. He won the _croix de guerre_ and was evacuated for\r\nhis wounds April 24, 1915.\r\n\r\nIt seems that he carried the remains of his company, which had been\r\ndecimated the night before by a mine explosion, on to the enemy trench,\r\ngetting there first and facing three Germans, whom he beat down. At\r\nthis time, gas shells began to rain about. Making a number of violent\r\nexpiratory movements to get rid of the gas, he found himself unable to\r\nprogress on account of the fall of the shells, and sat motionless with\r\nhis hands before his face. He was cast to the earth by an explosion,\r\nwhich at the same time blew off a revolver which the wounded lieutenant\r\nhad passed to him. He sat up, and, observing that the soldiers had\r\ngotten the trench, went back to the lines, where he told his story.\r\n\r\nHe then found that he was deaf, and wounded in the left leg. The wounds\r\nrapidly healed, but sundry other symptoms developed. He had a peculiar\r\nsensation back of the forehead. He could not think, read or write and\r\nwas very weary. He got better in a few months, but disorders kept\r\nreturning.\r\n\r\nHis deafness had left him in about a fortnight, but when his hearing\r\ncame back spontaneously, there were peculiar sensations. He constantly\r\nheard an electric bell, intense and continuous, like that of a French\r\ncinema advertising its films. The sounds seemed to begin in the ear\r\nand to run out as a sort of whistling. This sensation was preceded by\r\nbuzzing and associated with noises like those of a musical triangle\r\nor a steam whistle. The noise kept up during waking hours, but was\r\noften forgotten while he was at work. In sleep he heard nothing, except\r\nsometimes battle noises. August 20, 1915, he was given the diagnosis:\r\nlabyrinthine shock--hearing returned.\r\n\r\nAbout ten weeks after evacuation, when the headaches and thought\r\nblocking began to disappear, a generalized tremor, especially of\r\nthe head, set in, which the patient called St. Vitus’ dance. Then a\r\npeculiar gait began, which lasted several weeks and then transiently\r\nreappeared. Every few steps his legs would bend, and he could only walk\r\nforward in the attitude of a man who is concealing his height. After\r\nresting a few minutes he began to walk regularly again and the cycle\r\nbegan over again. He had to walk with two canes. If he felt some sudden\r\nemotion, or sometimes without any obvious reason, he would stop short\r\nand look straight ahead, with body bent, and arms before his face. This\r\nwould last but a moment, whereupon he would walk again normally.\r\n\r\nWhen this anomalous walking disappeared, curious face movements and\r\ngestures began. If a strange person arrived, the forehead and eyebrows\r\nwould contract, the eyelids would stand wide, which gave him an\r\nexpression of surprise lasting a few seconds. At the same time the\r\nmouth would open and remain so for some moments. A forced expiration\r\nwould be executed, suggesting a fish out of water. He would then\r\nimperatively strike the table with his fist, or the ground with his\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nLaignel-Lavastine and Courbon explain the anomalous movements as\r\nstereotypies due to secondary automatism. They are not convulsive, are\r\nnot preceded by emotion or followed by a sense of relief, and are not\r\ntics. They are gestures and postures without present significance,\r\nbut adapted to certain former circumstances. The electric bell effect\r\nis a sort of pseudohallucination, differing from true hallucinations\r\nin little except the absence of the externalizing feature. The\r\nstereotypical movements are reproductions of things done in the battle,\r\nand the pseudohallucinations relate to the former hotel work of the\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n\r\nCinema worker, two days after being waked up by a shell, develops a\r\nnystagmiform tremor of eyes and tachycardia. Graves’ disease? Tic\r\n(“occupational virtuosity”)?\r\n\r\n=Case 315.= (TINEL, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was waked up with a start Sept. 22, 1914, by a shell burst.\r\nThe man was not wounded or shocked, and merely felt a good deal moved.\r\nThe next day but one he felt a little movement of his eyes, which was\r\nat first intermittent but in three or four days became continuous and\r\ntroublesome. These movements were those of nystagmus, almost transverse\r\nand very rapid, and suggestive rather of a vibratory trembling than\r\nof a true nystagmus of the eye or of labyrinthine disease. When the\r\npatient fixed an object, the nystagmus would stop for a few seconds and\r\nthen immediately reappear. There had never been any vertigo, nausea,\r\nvomiting, deafness, ocular disorder, or disorder of equilibration.\r\nDuring the tests for nystagmus, the morbid nystagmus would stop and\r\nbe replaced by the normal nystagmus which was obviously slower and\r\nmore regular. The condition had persisted from September, 1914, to the\r\nmeeting of the Neurological Society, April 15, 1915. The patient said\r\nhe had become very emotional and got palpitations on the slightest\r\noccasion, such as a fast walk, going upstairs, or hearing a loud noise.\r\nThere was also a slight vibratory trembling of the fingers and a\r\npermanent tachycardia (120-140 beats). Tinel regards the case as one of\r\nneurosis, due to a neuromuscular hyperexcitability comparable in some\r\nways with that found in Graves’ disease.\r\n\r\nMeige, in discussion, called attention to the fact that not every\r\nnystagmus is of organic origin and that there is a rare form of tic\r\nof nystagmiform nature. The victim in this case was an employee in a\r\nmoving picture house, and very possibly his occupation had permitted\r\nhim to utilize what Meige speaks of as a “occupational virtuosity” of\r\nthe eye muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSynesthesialgia: FOOT pain on rubbing dry HANDS, following bullet wound\r\nof leg.\r\n\r\n=Case 316.= (LORTAT-JACOB AND SÉZARY, November, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA foot chasseur was wounded, September 15, 1914, low in the right\r\nthigh, a bullet entering outside the biceps tendon and emerging on the\r\ninner aspect of the leg, 4 cm. below the knee joint. He at once began\r\nto feel pains in the right foot, which grew swollen and red. The leg\r\nbegan to flex upon the thigh and, after straightening under anesthesia,\r\nwas placed in plaster. An arteriovenous aneurysm developed in the\r\npopliteal space; operation, October 22nd, followed November 1, by\r\nligature. The pains in the foot grew better after this operation; but\r\nas soon as the wound was cicatrized they came back again as before.\r\n\r\nFor seven months the foot pains remained sharp and continuous, such\r\nthat the man could not leave his bed. If a bright light struck his\r\neyes, the pains grew much more marked, especially in the morning on\r\nawakening. The patient found that when his _hands_ were _dry_ he could\r\nnot use them because of the violent _pains_ which rubbing them would\r\ncause in the _right foot_. Accordingly he kept putting his hands to his\r\nmouth to moisten them. Finally he kept a wet rag by him which he could\r\npass from one hand to the other.\r\n\r\nThe pain was what made walking difficult. Foot movements were only a\r\nbit less ample on the affected side than on the normal side. There was\r\na general muscular atrophy of the lower extremity (30.5: 34 about calf,\r\nand 40: 49 about thigh). Right knee-jerk more lively than left. Right\r\nAchilles jerk absent. Negligible disorders of electrical excitability\r\nin the territory of the right sciatic nerve. The skin of the foot was\r\na little thin and pale; the temperature was low; and the nails had\r\ntransverse striations. The pains grew gradually a little less marked,\r\nbut if the room temperature was increased or lowered or if the foot\r\nbecame cold, the pains became extreme. Pressure on the popliteal space\r\nproduced pain on the external border of the foot; likewise pressure\r\non the calf. Lasègue’s sign could not be tested for on account of the\r\ncontracture of the flexors of leg on thigh. Due to the direct action of\r\nthe bullet, there was an objective hyperesthesia of the dorsum and sole\r\nof the foot. The toes were anesthetic. A cold foot bath increased the\r\npains, and a warm foot bath diminished them (contrary to experience in\r\nanalgesias).\r\n\r\nThis was a case of synesthesialgia in the right foot, brought about by\r\nrubbing dry hands, exactly as if there were a direct contact with the\r\nfoot. Milder painful reactions were brought about by bright lights and\r\nloud noises; but on the whole, these other effects were insignificant.\r\nIt must be remembered that the man was wounded and plainly had also\r\norganic nervous disorder. He sometimes complained of radiations of\r\nthe pain up to the left hypochondrium, and sometimes he showed the\r\nclassical sensation of “esophageal globus” (lump in the throat). In\r\nshort, there was in him a special excitability of the nervous system\r\nwhich may partly explain the synesthesialgia.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; burial: Clonic spasms; later, stupor with amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 317.= (GAUPP, March, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA reservist, 28 (laborer in civil life, of a nervous family; even\r\nbefore mobilization had attacks of weakness at his work or in the\r\ncompany of others) January 3 or 4, 1915, fainted in the trench while\r\nshells were striking around him. On January 5 he was brought to\r\nhospital in deep stupor. He went to the reserve hospital at N. by\r\nhospital train, January 8, and arrived at the Tübingen clinic January\r\n18.\r\n\r\nA slip of paper stated that after burial in the trench he had been\r\nbrought from the field unconscious. Clonic spasms of the upper part\r\nof the body are said to have occurred. At the reserve hospital in N.,\r\nJanuary 10, he was still unconscious, at times twitching his face and\r\nthe upper part of his body, and once at night excited and delirious.\r\n\r\nAt first in the clinic he was apathetic, speaking not a word, looking\r\nvacantly into the air as if lost in a dream. He went to the section\r\npassively, and lay passively in bed.\r\n\r\nIn the examining room, he stood speechless with unemotional face,\r\nsometimes looking up to the ceiling, slowly scratching his head,\r\nfailing to answer questions, although fixing his eyes upon the\r\nphysician. He could not be communicated with in writing, playing\r\nuncomprehendingly with the pencil or scratching his head with it. He\r\nwould start with fright at a sudden noise or an unexpected touch.\r\nSometimes he would heave a deep sigh, grasp his head in his hands, or\r\nlay hold of his hair with a hopeless expression of face and shake his\r\nhead to and fro.\r\n\r\nNext day, January 19, he made a few slow, low answers. He was found\r\nto be entirely disoriented and with associations impeded, although he\r\ncould get out his name and residence with difficulty. Some of his color\r\nidentifications were correct, such as red and green; some impossible,\r\nas yellow, brown, violet. A comrade who was called in and could speak\r\nthe Cologne dialect, was talked with at first with difficulty, later\r\nmore easily. Although the patient was visibly freer, he remained\r\nwithout apparent emotion, retaining a rigid and dreamlike expression of\r\nface. It was hard to find words, although objects were named correctly,\r\nand there was no paraphasia or agnosia. Vision and hearing were normal;\r\nwalking, manual movements, eating were all undisturbed though slow. The\r\npatient had to be led to the toilet. It seemed as if all intellectual\r\nlife was at rest, and that in the absence of impulses from without,\r\nthere would have been complete apathy. It was made out that the patient\r\nthought he was still in the trenches.\r\n\r\nNext day, the stupor had decreased and the patient spoke, getting his\r\nbearings for a time. There was a complete amnesia as to the cause and\r\nduration of his condition. During the next period, up to the beginning\r\nof February, 1915, consciousness cleared and the apathy was replaced\r\nwith anxiety, weariness, and a dull headache.\r\n\r\nDuring February, the patient gradually returned to his senses, and\r\nremained in a state of general nervous exhaustion. Amnesia was complete\r\nfor at least two weeks of his life and recollections were fragmentary\r\nfor the first three days of his stay in the clinic. He worked willingly\r\nin the garden with the other patients. On February 26, the patient was\r\ncured and went back to the reserve battalion in a much strengthened\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nBattles (including liquid fire); eventually shell-shock: Hallucinatory\r\ndelirium, mutism, asthenia--after a few days puerilism (history of\r\nconvulsive crisis in adolescence) with regression of personality to\r\nlate childhood.\r\n\r\n=Case 318.= (CHARON AND HALBERSTADT, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nPuerilism (Dupré) appeared in a soldier, 21 (uncle and cousin insane;\r\npatient had difficulty in studies at fourteen and nervous spells for\r\ntwo years, with loss of consciousness, fall and convulsions probably\r\nat rare intervals; a student at eighteen) after he had taken part in\r\na number of battles with the Chasseurs Alpins. He was exposed once\r\nto liquid fire July 21, 1916. He entered the military psychiatric\r\ncenter at Amiens. Mental troubles had followed the bursting of a\r\nshell near him. He said a few words, such as, “Alsace; fire; blood;\r\nsnow; it hurts.” These phrases, spoken in a low tone, with an anxious\r\nappearance, eyes fixed, suggested hallucination. He seemed to be\r\nlistening. Aside from the isolated words above mentioned he showed\r\ncomplete mutism. There was physical weakness, difficulty in walking\r\nwithout support, exaggeration of patellar reflexes, pains in the head\r\nand limbs. After several days, he said, “Milk; bread.” After this the\r\nanxiety and the slow and difficult walking disappeared, whereupon the\r\npuerilism appeared.\r\n\r\nNow the soldier began to run instead of walking. He galloped and\r\ngamboled like a child imitating a horse, or he would sit on a board\r\nseeming to paddle. He would skip along the halls. The puerilistic\r\nphases were rather brief and for the most part he lay in bed. There was\r\nstill a certain asthenia. He made little paper boats in bed, keeping\r\nthem in a small metal box along with bits of bread, looking glass and\r\nthe like. If a gesture was made to take them away, he would protest and\r\npress the box to his breast, looking childish and anxious, and if the\r\nbox were taken he would weep hot tears. Sometimes he would stick out\r\nhis tongue at the attendants. His mother came to see him and afterwards\r\nhe would say, “Mamma told me to be good, to eat well, to get well and\r\nto go home.” He would use childish grammar,--“Me eat much.” Asked why\r\nhe had hollowed out a small hole in the wall of the room, he answered,\r\n“I did it for fun, but I will not do it any more. Mother doesn’t want\r\nme to.” The patient was unwilling to answer a question correctly; would\r\nsometimes answer incorrectly at first and correctly afterward.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the man had adopted the language, occupations and\r\nattitude of a child, showing a regression of personality ten to twelve\r\nyears backwards. There was a neurotic basis in the convulsive crises\r\nof adolescence. On the basis of this predisposition following shock\r\nthere appeared an attack of confusion, upon which, several days later,\r\nsupervened ecmnesic phenomena of hysterical nature assuming all the\r\nfeatures of puerilism.\r\n\r\n\r\nBomb-dropping from airplane; unconsciousness: Battle dreams. Leaves of\r\nabsence failed to relieve. Episodes of dizziness and fugue.\r\n\r\n=Case 319.= (LATTES AND GORIA, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nM. Alessandro, Class ’79, baker (father a drunkard; brother an idiot,\r\nin asylum), had typhus in youth, and as a boy had periods of intense\r\n“pavor nocturnus,” but no convulsions. He enjoyed good health in the\r\narmy before the following event:\r\n\r\nOn July 13, 1915, a bomb, dropped by an airplane, fell near an Italian\r\nsoldier, killing many comrades, and throwing the man to the ground\r\nunconscious. He awoke several hours later at a hospital in a stunned\r\ncondition. During the night, under the influence of terrifying dreams,\r\nhe would leave his bed to look for enemies who, it seemed to him, were\r\nthrowing stones and firing. He managed to grasp a rifle and fire at the\r\nimages he saw. He was given a 60 days’ leave of absence during which\r\nhe did not improve; and then again 90 days’ furlough, which he spent\r\nat his home, where terrifying dreams, tremor of limbs and asthenia\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nHe came under observation February 10, after his second leave.\r\nNutrition fair. Insomnia. Constant terrifying dreams. Coated tongue.\r\nTremor of hands, head, body, ceasing during voluntary movements.\r\nEpisodically he had spells of dizziness followed by absent-mindedness,\r\nwhereupon he wandered aimlessly about, of a sudden becoming aware of\r\nbeing in a place, but not knowing how he came there.\r\n\r\nSpecial senses intact. Several points of cutaneous hyperesthesia,\r\nparticularly mammary and pseudo-ovarian on the left, pressure whereon\r\nprovoked a lively emotional reaction with acceleration of pulse,\r\nredness, lacrimation. Knee reflexes lively, cutaneous reflexes normal,\r\nexcept the plantar which were very lively. Restless, hyperemotional, he\r\nwept for insignificant reasons and wanted to leave hospital for fear of\r\ndying there. He was discharged unimproved after a fortnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nNostalgic temperament; depression on entering service; rheumatism. A\r\nbox falls from an airplane near by: Fear and tears; later depression,\r\nnostalgia, dreams, hyperthyroidism.\r\n\r\n=Case 320.= (BENNATI, October, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian private in the infantry was recalled to military service. He\r\nwas a small farmer, and being disposed to homesickness, grew depressed\r\nfrom the day he left for service. His sleep was disturbed, he was\r\ngreatly affected by the wet and damp of the trenches, and was in a\r\nstate of continual fear. Finally, pains, hypersensitiveness, and fever\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nAs an enemy airplane passed over one day, a box fell at the man’s\r\nfeet and threw him into a profound fear with tears. He was conducted\r\nto a tent to rest; his regiment was shortly sent to the rear, and he\r\nremained on active service for a few days despite the fever and pains.\r\nFinally the swelling of his leg compelled him to take to bed. (Fatigue\r\nin antebellum life had always shown itself in aches of the legs.) He\r\nhad now been in active service about a month and his homesickness\r\novercame him. He was in a state of deep physical and mental depression.\r\nIt was not his own troubles so much as those of his family which\r\npreoccupied him. His knees hurt him so that he had to weep; or if\r\nSardinia was mentioned, he cried, and said, “Oh, how I love Sardinia!”\r\nHe grew fatigued very easily. He had many dreams about Sardinia, his\r\nfather, and the war, especially dreaming about being wounded in the\r\nlegs (question of being stimulated by the joint aches). The reflexes\r\nwere normal, though slight tremors set up in the legs after testing.\r\nThe thyroid gland was somewhat swollen, and it appears that the patient\r\nhad noticed this five days before entering hospital. The patient was\r\nrather vagotonic; pulse-rate stood at 56; oculocardiac-reflex, 56-84;\r\nMannkopf negative; Thomayer and Erben marked (56-88 and 88-60); von\r\nGraefe marked; Stellwag present.\r\n\r\n\r\nA shell pitches without bursting: Unconsciousness; stupor; MAMA MIA!;\r\noniric delirium; amnesia. Recovery in five weeks.\r\n\r\n=Case 321.= (LATTES AND GORIA, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian soldier of the Class of ’95, a mechanic (mother cardiac; as\r\na boy, pains in joints and heart; since boyhood, no illness), had a\r\nbig Austrian shell pitch near him, July 23, 1915. The shell failed to\r\nexplode and injured no one. The patient, however, fell to the ground,\r\nunconscious, and remained in the camp hospital for two days, quite\r\nimmobile. This event followed an advance by his company under very\r\nfatiguing circumstances without sleep for a period of four days.\r\n\r\nJuly 26, the patient was observed in profound stupor, non-reactive,\r\nconstantly and monotonously repeating the phrase, _Mama mia!_, with\r\nfixed gaze and smiling as if at visions. He swallowed food. The pupils\r\nreacted poorly to light, and the cornea and nasal mucosa seemed\r\nanesthetic. The tendon and skin reflexes were lively. The muscles were\r\nhypotonic; bradycardia, 56; no control over feces or urine.\r\n\r\nJuly 27-28, restlessness at night, gasping movements, and poses of\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nJuly 29, he called for his mother, who had been dead for several years.\r\nHe was still stuporous and insensible.\r\n\r\nFrom August 1 to 10, he improved slowly and became able to carry bread\r\nto his mouth after it had been put in his hands. He still did not speak\r\nand made signs when he wished to urinate or defecate. Pulse 50-60.\r\n\r\nAugust 12, the patient began to react to intense light and to pain\r\nstimuli, as well as to pressure. He ate voraciously.\r\n\r\nAugust 15, visual stimuli were responded to, the pulse had risen to 80,\r\nthe skin reflexes were no less lively. There began to be terrifying\r\ndreams at night, with motor reactions.\r\n\r\nAugust 17, the patient looked about more alertly, promptly seeing bread\r\nwhen placed in the center of the field of vision and saying words to\r\nthe man who might try to remove the bread. He did not yet react to\r\nacoustic stimuli, nor was there any other change up to August 21.\r\n\r\nAugust 22 a notable improvement set in. The hearing was now slightly\r\ndiminished, questions were answered after a brief refractory period.\r\nAfter a few questions, however, a state of exhaustion would ensue,\r\nwhich would disappear only after a short rest. There was amnesia for\r\nthe entire period following the day of his departure for the front,\r\nMay, 1915. At this time, instead of eating voraciously, he showed\r\nanorexia. The skin and tendon reflexes, instead of being lively, were\r\nnow dull. There still were battle dreams of enemies trying to kill him.\r\n\r\nAugust 25, there was an area of hypesthesia on the inner aspect of the\r\nright thigh, but otherwise no disorder of sensation. The pulse stood at\r\n80 and there were no other neurological phenomena.\r\n\r\nAugust 31, the patch of hypesthesia of the thigh and the retrograde\r\namnesia disappeared. There was still a slight diminution of hearing.\r\nThe accident of the non-exploding bomb could now be recalled, but there\r\nwas a memory gap for all facts up to the latter part of August.\r\n\r\nSeptember 2, dreamless sleep; no signs of abnormality except a slight\r\ndiminution of hearing. Discharged, well.\r\n\r\n\r\nJostled carrying explosives; no explosion; unconsciousness: Deafmutism\r\nand foggy vision. Gradual recovery from these symptoms. Then, on rising\r\nfrom bed, camptocormia.\r\n\r\n=Case 322.= (LATTES AND GORIA, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian of the Class of 1891 (convulsions and pains in the spine,\r\nwith rigidity, as a child; typhoid fever at 18; brother sickly,\r\nneuropathic; mother subject to periodic convulsions; father alcoholic\r\nand nervous), on the night of November 26, 1915, was carrying a number\r\nof tubes of explosives. A comrade stumbled and fell over the soldier,\r\nwho fell to the ground unconscious. None of the glycerine tubes\r\nexploded, and none of the soldiers round about were hurt.\r\n\r\nThe man regained consciousness at the camp hospital, but remained\r\ndeafmute and also impaired as to vision. It was as if a screen of fog\r\nlay between him and objects seen.\r\n\r\nDuring fifteen days of observation at the camp hospital, he had\r\nterrible war nightmares. The mutism, the visual disorder, and the\r\ndeafness then gradually disappeared without special treatment.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the patient rose from bed, it was found that his lumbar\r\nvertebral column was stiff. He walked bent forward and was unable\r\nto bend or straighten the back. There was a hyperesthesia along the\r\nvertebrae, especially on pressure. X-ray examination showed no bone\r\nlesion. The larynx and cornea were sensitive, and the plantar reflexes\r\nwere absent. The abdominal reflexes were present. The pupils reacted\r\nto light and accommodation. There were two areas of analgesia in the\r\nnipple regions. The expression of the patient’s face was relaxed and\r\ndrooping.\r\n\r\n\r\nA heavy cannon slides and grazes a man: Unconsciousness; stupor;\r\namnesia (anterograde amnesia persistent). Complete recovery in less\r\nthan seven weeks.\r\n\r\n=Case 323.= (LATTES AND GORIA, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian soldier of the Class of 1895, a peasant (family healthy;\r\nnon-alcoholic; good scholar) was, July 19, 1915, helping drag a heavy\r\ncannon up hill. The big gun slid, hit several men, and grazed the\r\npatient, making a slight abrasion on his leg. He immediately lost\r\nconsciousness, and arrived at the camp hospital in a stupor, which\r\nlasted so long that catheterization was necessary.\r\n\r\nA week later he was observed in hospital, immobile and non-reactive,\r\nwith a swollen abdomen and fecal impaction. The pupils were widely\r\ndilated and reacted poorly to light. The corneal reflexes were absent,\r\nand the nasal mucosa was anesthetic. Pulse 50. The patient failed\r\nto eat. Next day there was no change in his condition. He was quiet\r\nthroughout the night.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 29, a number of answers were obtained to\r\nquestions put in a loud voice, though he was unaware of much more than\r\nhis name, being ignorant of the name of his country, his age, his\r\ndivision, where he had come from, what had happened to him, or where he\r\nwas. He had now begun to eat spontaneously.\r\n\r\nDuring the following days, up to August 4, the amnesia gradually\r\ndissolved for the facts before the trauma. He remembered having been\r\ngreatly frightened at the time of the accident but could not remember\r\nthe accident itself, and the gap for subsequent events was still\r\ncomplete. The pharyngeal reflex was still poor. August 5, he began\r\nto remember the details concerning the accident. About the middle of\r\nAugust there was no longer any diminution of hearing and ideation\r\nbecame more free and rapid.\r\n\r\nSeptember 4, he was discharged, well.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosions SEEN: Emotion; insomnia. Artillery HEARD twelve days\r\nlater: “finished off.”\r\n\r\n=Case 324.= (WILTSHIRE, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA lance-corporal, 36, had had a nervous debility four or five years\r\nbefore the war, caused by an overstudy of music. He had not stopped\r\nwork at that time, but suffered from depression, anorexia, and\r\ninsomnia, lasting for some weeks.\r\n\r\nThe lance-corporal got on well at the front for 11 weeks, until finally\r\neight shells pitched near him. Although he was unhurt, he began to\r\nsuffer from anorexia, insomnia, and depression. While in billets 12\r\ndays later, some English artillery became heavily engaged, whereupon\r\n“The noise promptly finished me off.” The insomnia, depression, and\r\nanorexia became more marked, and the patient could not sleep unless\r\nheavily drugged.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Emotion. More shells: Insomnia; war dreams. Head tremor\r\nand tic, two weeks after initial shock.\r\n\r\n=Case 325.= (WILTSHIRE, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nThe psychic trauma is, according to Wiltshire, more important than\r\nphysical trauma in the following case of a sergeant of infantry, 28,\r\na man without neuropathic taint. This man had been nine months at the\r\nfront and through Mons, but had been quite well until three weeks\r\nbefore coming to hospital.\r\n\r\n“Twenty-three days ago, I was issuing rations when they got the range\r\nof us--and killed the other chaps. I got blown away and knocked over.\r\nI saw everything--fellows in pieces. Then a second shell came. I got\r\nlifted and knocked about ten yards.” Then he began to shake but carried\r\non.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, “Shells dropped on the dug-out and killed the other\r\nchaps. I have not slept properly since this. If I go to sleep, I wake\r\nup seeing people killed, shells dropping, and all kinds of horrid\r\ndreams about war.” One or two of the men killed had been pals.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after the first incident, while in a base hospital,\r\nhead-shaking began. The patient would jump at the least sound. There\r\nwere spasmodic tic movements with the extension of the head, protrusion\r\nof lower jaw, and contraction of occipitofrontalis muscle. Sometimes\r\nthe left shoulder girdle was affected in the same way. There was a\r\nslight fine tremor of hands and eyelids and difficulty in keeping the\r\neyes fixed on an object.\r\n\r\n\r\nHyperthyroidism, hemiplegia, irritative symptoms after exhaustion (by\r\nheat?).\r\n\r\n=Case 326.= (OPPENHEIM, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man (not previously nervous, no faulty heredity, heatstroke August\r\n21) suddenly fell down in a great heat, after a fatiguing march,\r\nand remained unconscious for several hours, waking with vertigo,\r\nheadache, paralysis of left side, vomiting, and twitching of the\r\nface. On September 23, admitted to reserve hospital. Knee phenomenon\r\nincreased. Urinary retention; catheter used. Speech disturbance,\r\nfacial twitching. Vomiting had stopped September 10. Catheterization\r\ncould be avoided through warm sitz-baths. October 30, on sitting up,\r\noccipital pain and vertigo. November 15, urinary symptoms improved.\r\nAlso improvement otherwise. December 1, gait vacillating and uncertain.\r\nHeadache. Admission to nerve hospital, December 3. Here complained of\r\ntwitchings in the frontals and corrugators. Wide palpebral gaps. Rare,\r\nor absent, movements of lids. The extended hands showed active, rapid\r\ntremor. Tendon phenomena increased in the arms and especially in the\r\nlegs. Abdominal reflexes increased. Active tremor in the legs. Gluteal\r\ntremor. Very pronounced Graves’ symptoms. Syndactylism very pronounced\r\nin the feet, between second and third toes. Later on, improvement under\r\nhalf-baths, etc. Worse after ten days’ leave of absence, especially\r\nmarked increase of tremor (rest tremor), augmented on movement.\r\n\r\n_Re_ heat stroke, Wollenberg has called attention to the effect of the\r\nheat of the summer months upon German soldiers. Cases of heat stroke\r\nhave not been rare in the German army. About half the cases have\r\nconvulsions or epileptoid seizures, as well as tremors and nystagmus.\r\nAbout a quarter of the cases have shown confusion and delusions, with\r\nanxiety and mania. A degree of mental impairment has followed a number\r\nof these heat strokes, together with sundry signs of organic disorder,\r\nsuch as reflex changes, pupillary changes, and difficulty in speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nForced marches; skirmishes; rheumatism: Generalized TREMORS. On the\r\nroad to recovery in six months.\r\n\r\n=Case 327.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA German letter carrier, 27, entered the war at the outset, made forced\r\nmarches in great heat, was in a number of skirmishes and in the capture\r\nof Namur, and fell ill early in September, with swollen and painful\r\nright foot and rheumatic pains in knees and shoulders. He was put on\r\ngarrison duty; but the rheumatic pains in the joints increased toward\r\nthe end of September, and he was treated in hospital for rheumatism.\r\n\r\nHe became able to walk only in the second half of December, marked\r\ntremors affecting the whole body. His bodily condition had been good.\r\nHe slept well, and while at rest in bed he felt entirely well; but upon\r\nevery attempt to get up and put his feet down, these violent trembling\r\nmotions would always reappear. Treatment by hydro- and electrotherapy\r\nremained entirely unsuccessful. February 8 he was transferred to a\r\nnerve hospital.\r\n\r\nHe had been in the postal service from 1903. He was of normal bodily\r\nand mental development and had had no previous illnesses. His military\r\nservice had been executed from 1909 to 1911. He had always been a\r\npassionate smoker but had not abused alcohol. His mother is said to\r\nhave been for some time paralyzed, following a fright.\r\n\r\nPhysically, the patient was a slender but strongly-built and fairly\r\nwell-nourished soldier. The first sound at the apex of the heart was\r\nrough and impure, and the heart was somewhat enlarged to the left.\r\nThe pulse was irregular, 106. The arteries were somewhat stiff.\r\nNeurologically, there was a marked dermatographia of comparatively long\r\nduration. The periosteal reflexes were increased; the deep reflexes\r\ncould not be properly examined. The whole leg trembled and heaved\r\nunsuccessfully on attempts to raise it voluntarily. After even a\r\nslight stroke on the patellar tendon, the trembling became excessive\r\nand irregular, and the leg passed into a heaving spasm which would\r\noutlast the percussion for some time. The patellar clonus could be\r\nobtained with the knee extended. The shaking movements were somewhat\r\nmore marked on the right than on the left side. Similar phenomena\r\noccurred when the Achilles reflexes were being examined. The triceps\r\nreflexes on both sides were increased but there was no tremor or spasm\r\nof the arms. The plantar reflexes were very lively, and following these\r\nreflexes appeared tremors of the legs. When the spinous processes\r\nof the vertebral column were percussed, a general shaking spasm\r\nappeared. Tactile sense was everywhere normal, but the pain sense\r\nwas increased. Upon slight pin-pricks in the skin of the legs, there\r\nwould occur a marked shaking spasm of the leg, passing directly to the\r\nother leg. These phenomena were more marked on the right side than\r\non the left. When sitting upon a chair with back supported, a slight\r\ntremor would appear when the hands were raised and stretched out, more\r\nmarkedly on the right side than on the left. Movements of the arms\r\nwere normal. However, the hand-grasps were: right, 105; left, 80. In\r\ndorsal decubitus the movements of the leg were performed comparatively\r\nwell at first, but after a few repetitions, the shaking spasm would\r\noccur on both sides, and the movements would become very awkward. The\r\nheel-to-knee test would then fail. If the patient were put on his feet,\r\nhe would immediately fall into spasms, first in the right leg, then in\r\nthe left. The trunk would now be involved, and soon the arms, whereupon\r\nthe whole body, with the exception of the head, would be seen trembling\r\nand shaking, and the patient would fall forward, trying to get support\r\nby leaning against a wall, seizing a chair, or sinking down slowly.\r\nThe spasms disappeared at once in dorsal decubitus and in sitting with\r\nsupported back. Outward irritation by the acoustic, optic or tactile\r\navenues would bring out spasms in the legs, always more markedly on the\r\nright side than on the left. Psychic irritations would cause spasms.\r\nThe muscles of the limbs were held in great tension, the flexors and\r\nextensors being alternately affected. When the patient was moving\r\nalong a wall with a difficult, swaying gait, his efforts reminded the\r\nexaminer of the attempts of a heavily intoxicated man to walk. Upon\r\nattempts to create passive movements of the lower limbs, severe shaking\r\nand trembling movements set in, followed by a general spastic tension\r\nof the leg musculature such that it could not be further flexed or\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nThe patient was put in the psychiatric section, as too seriously ill\r\nfor the nerve hospital. He improved after a few days, being then able\r\nto walk without much support although still with some shaking and\r\ntremor. If his attention was diverted, passive movement of the leg\r\ncould be carried out without developing spasm. He was treated in a\r\nroom by himself with removal of all outward irritation. His legs were\r\ntreated for an hour, three times daily, by means of moist packs. On\r\naccount of complaints of insomnia he was given small doses of hypnotics.\r\n\r\nThe main thing here, according to Binswanger, is the psychotherapy. The\r\npatient was told almost daily in the course of conversation, first,\r\nthat the illness was being cured; secondly, that upon recovery he would\r\nbe employed in the future only on the postal service. He was told that\r\nhe would have to avoid marked physical exertion, of course, but that he\r\nstill would be fit for office work and could serve the fatherland in\r\nthis way. Still he could not be transferred back to the hospital, he\r\nwas told, unless he became entirely well, so that he could move with\r\nperfect freedom.\r\n\r\nFebruary 23 the patient was performing daily exercises in walking and\r\nstanding; the spasm became very slight on standing, and often would\r\nentirely cease, but it remained still plainly present in the legs; the\r\ntrunk and arms were free. External irritations were now less prone to\r\nexcite spasm. Sleep became quiet and dreamless. He was transferred to\r\nthe nerve hospital, able to move about freely in house and garden and\r\nonly tremulous after long walks and considerable bodily and mental\r\nfatigue. He was given a week’s furlough home. He wished very much to\r\nget into the postal service; at the time of the report he had not\r\nattained this goal. He had renewed attacks of trembling upon exertion,\r\nand was transferred at the end of June to a convalescent home.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; emotion: Hyperkinesis, fear, dreams.\r\n\r\n=Case 328.= (MOTT, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private, 21, was with 30 men carrying sandbags in the daylight, under\r\nshell fire. He was thrown into a deep hole by an explosion, climbed\r\nout, and saw all his mates dead.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted to the Fourth London General Hospital, June 20, 1915,\r\nhaving been at Boulogne for a fortnight. He was lying in bed on his\r\nback, making continuous jerky lateral movements of head, and movements\r\nof arms, especially of the left arm. He was groaning slightly, now and\r\nthen raising his eyelids with a staring expression of bewilderment\r\nand terror. He was able to mutter answers to questions. He would\r\noccasionally raise his right hand to his forehead. If he was observed,\r\nthese movements became exaggerated. They ceased in sleep. He muttered\r\neven when unobserved. He continually said, “You won’t let me back.”\r\nAsked as to dreams, he replied, “Guns.” Voluntary movements were made,\r\nwhich prevented obtaining reflexes. When his pupils were to be examined\r\nby a man in uniform, he showed a marked facies of terror; his pupils\r\nwere dilated; the eyes opened wide, the brows were furrowed, and there\r\nwas an anxious scowl. The flash of an electric light produced the same\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nJune 24 the patient was much better. He said the explosion which had\r\nkilled his friends after he had been only a few weeks at the front,\r\nwas the first serious event in his service. He kept seeing it again,\r\nwith bright lights and bursting shells. Sometimes he would hear the men\r\nshouting. In dreams he both saw and heard shells and men. There was\r\npain in the back and right side of the head.\r\n\r\nJune 26 he was improved but still had pain in the back of the head,\r\nespecially when trying to remember, and a slight tremor of the hands.\r\nHe had been given hot baths at Boulogne on account of being very cold\r\nand shivering. He had always felt sick at the sight of blood. He was\r\nboarded for Home Service six months after admission.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell fire and barbed-wire work: Tremors, anesthesias, temperature and\r\npain hallucinations.\r\n\r\n=Case 329.= (MYERS, March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA corporal, 39, had been working under shell fire at barbed-wire\r\nentanglements. The man was big and robust, but much depressed,\r\ncomplaining of noises in the head, pricking pains, unsteady legs,\r\nfatigue, irritability, loss of confidence. He showed tremors of arms\r\nand legs on movement, and stood unsteadily with eyes closed. He said:\r\n“My legs have been very unsteady, especially when some one is looking\r\nat me. They must have thought me drunk at times.”\r\n\r\nThe head and tongue were tremulous, the knee-jerks exaggerated, the\r\nsoles insensitive to touch and pain; but sensibility to deep pressure\r\nwas retained. There was a gradual return of right answers on further\r\ntrials, aided by comparison with effects of stimuli applied to the\r\ndorsum of the foot. Though he gave correct replies on heat and cold\r\ntests over the arms, he gave wrong answers over the dorsum of the feet,\r\nless often over legs, sometimes over thighs.\r\n\r\nLater during examination, the feet became tremulous. He felt a “silly\r\nchildish fear,” and his hands began to feel cold and clammy; whereupon\r\nhe began to reply _hot_ or _cold_ when the tubes were not applied\r\nat all (temperature hallucinations). There were apparently pain\r\nhallucinations in the soles and errors in response to the compasses.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the temperature hallucinations noted by Myers, these are to be\r\ndistinguished from true vasomotor disorders. Babinski believes that he\r\nhas definitely established that, though hysteria may cause a slight\r\nthermo-asymmetry, yet never a definite vasomotor or thermic disorder.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hysterical pains, the most frequent are probably those of\r\nhysterical pseudo sciatica, in which true signs of sciatica are absent,\r\nnamely, (1) loss of Achilles jerk, (2) scoliosis, (3) Lasègue’s sign\r\n(pain on thigh flexion with leg extension), (4) Neri’s sign (with trunk\r\nbent forward, affected knee flexed), and (5) Bonnet’s sign (pain on\r\nthigh adduction).\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Emotional crises; twice recurrent mutism; amnesia. A\r\ncomrade in the same explosion gets off with transient phenomena.\r\n\r\n=Case 330.= (MAIRET, PIÉRON AND BOUZANSKY, June, 1915.)\r\n\r\nDecember 15, sitting back of a wall were three minor officers and\r\nan _homme de liaison_, when a 105 shell punctured the wall and\r\nburst, killing one and wounding another severely. One of these, _a\r\nsous-lieutenant_, lost consciousness for a quarter of an hour and had\r\nsome severe headaches for a few days, but nothing more. The other, the\r\n_homme de liaison_, was found standing, bewildered, looking at the\r\ndead. When his name was called, he jumped and started off, weeping and\r\ncrying out.\r\n\r\nWhen caught, he was still somewhat clear, recognized his superior\r\nofficer, answered yes and no, but kept asking, “Where is the other?”\r\nNext day he kept weeping and said not a word.\r\n\r\nHe was evacuated through a series of hospitals and was sent to\r\nconvalesce with his sister at Montpellier, having now got back his\r\nspeech. He had a seizure of fear in the street and was picked up by\r\nthe police and was carried to a general hospital January 21. Here he\r\ncould not speak, could hardly write, being unable to find his words.\r\nHe walked slowly, bent over, eyes abnormally wide open, with a look\r\nof terror. The lighting of a match made him start off weeping. The\r\nsymptom picture included tinnitus, vertigo, deafness, some reduction\r\nof the visual field (especially on the left side), hypesthesia and\r\nhypalgesia on the left side, hyperalgesia on the right, painful points\r\n(epigastric, inguinal, supra and infra mammary left), reflex, muscular\r\nand tendon, hyperexcitability on right side, jactitation, impairment\r\nof recollective memory, complete memory gap for the accident and\r\neverything thereafter, retentive memory reduced, imagination impaired,\r\nnightmares (awaking with a start).\r\n\r\nA few days later he was able to pronounce his name with difficulty\r\nand to say yes and no. February 4 there was an appendicular crisis,\r\nwhereupon mutism became absolute again and lasted into May, despite\r\nsuggestive therapy.\r\n\r\nMay 10, improvement in memory for things before the accident grew\r\nbetter, nightmares had become less frequent, the jactitation had\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nThere was no neuropathic predisposition in this case except infantile\r\nconvulsions in two sisters, followed by nervous crises in one.\r\n\r\n_Re_ appendicular crisis, which was the occasion of a relapse in\r\nmutism, see remarks under relapses under Case 292.\r\n\r\n_Re_ mutism, Babinski counts mutism, hysteria major, and rhythmic\r\nchorea as so characteristically hysterical that no nervous disturbance\r\nof an organic nature can resemble them. The description of hysterical\r\nmutism is due to Charcot. According to Babinski, mutism is just as\r\ncurable as hysterical deafness, and perhaps more curable. Yet mutism\r\npersists unchanged for many months unless it is treated properly\r\nby some form of suggestion. “It may be almost said that a subject\r\nsuffering from speech defect, who nevertheless succeeds in making\r\nother people understand by all sorts of varied and expressive gestures\r\nthe circumstances of his condition, is a hysterical mute and not an\r\naphasic.” According to Babinski, no true case of hysterical aphasia has\r\nbeen published since the beginning of the war; all the cases have been\r\ncases of mutism.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion; fainting: Hysterical crises of emotion; fright at a\r\nfrog in the garden. Hereditary and acquired neuropathic taint.\r\n\r\n=Case 331.= (CLAUDE, DIDE AND LEJONNE, April, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant, 28 (mother nervous; father had nervous spells at fifteen;\r\npatient himself nervous as a child), was under a great moral strain at\r\nthe outbreak of war, and was utterly exhausted in a hard battle that\r\nlasted more than twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nA shell burst near him September 25 at the Somme, whereupon he\r\nfainted. He was evacuated to Amiens for three weeks; kept his bed;\r\nsomnambulistic; subject to nervous crises.\r\n\r\nHe passed to the hospital of Ferté-Bernard for a month, the crises\r\nbecoming more frequent. He was sent to a convalescent dépôt for three\r\ndays, thence for three months to La Plisse; got better; lived at home,\r\nbut went to a show where they played the _Marseillaise_, was profoundly\r\nmoved thereby, and had more crises; accordingly went back under medical\r\ncare and finally to his dépôt, where, upon seeing his old comrades, he\r\nhad more crises, and was finally evacuated to the neurological center\r\nof the Eighth Region.\r\n\r\nHe there seemed mistrustful when asked to tell his story. There was\r\na noise of cannon, whereupon he got up, ran in all directions in the\r\ngarden, bumping into trees in the greatest terror, yelling, “There they\r\nare!”; gesticulating, soliloquizing: “Bomb! Shell! Bayonet!” His pulse\r\nwas rapid. After he was calmed down, he began to talk again in a very\r\nclear, distinct, somewhat tremulous voice. A metallic sound made him\r\nshudder and cry out, “The drums!” and another scene of rushing about\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nIn the consulting office he wept. Battle dreams and nightmares,\r\nsoliloquies and terror, seminal losses, occurred during the next few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAugust 4, while alone in the garden, he heard a noise, went toward it\r\nand spied a frog, whereupon he had another crisis of fear and emotion.\r\nHe got another lieutenant, and both returned, sticks in hand. Pointing\r\nto a hole in the earth, Lieutenant A. said, “Trenches! There they\r\nare!” “What? Who?” said Lieutenant B. “The Boches!” said Lieutenant A.\r\nWhereupon Lieutenant B also saw them and cried out bravely, “Go away!”\r\nHowever, the second lieutenant immediately saw that he had been the\r\nsubject of suggestive hallucination.\r\n\r\nFifteen days of calm followed, during which the lieutenant became more\r\nsociable and grew better having no more crises.\r\n\r\nFour other cases of “hysteroemotive nature” are reported by Claude, all\r\nof them showing a special constitutional basis before the war. In the\r\ndifferential diagnosis, alcoholism, cyclothymia, obsessive psychosis\r\nand occasionally systematized delusional psychosis may be considered.\r\nThere were occasional stereotypical features in the cases, but of a\r\nvery fugitive nature. Dementia praecox is hardly to be considered.\r\n\r\n_Re_ “hysteroemotive” cases, Babinski holds that the claim of emotion\r\nas a single factor capable of causing hysteria by itself, is a false\r\nclaim. To be sure, the patients themselves may give accounts which lead\r\nto the idea of an emotional hysteria. Dide, one of the authors of the\r\nabove case, states that functional disorders occur only in subjects\r\nwhose emotional tone has been relaxed. The heaviest bombardments are\r\nnot in line to produce these disorders when the morale of the troops\r\nis good. The bloodiest affairs may leave no single case of nervous\r\ndisorder when the morale is good. Dide found in a whole year’s work\r\nbut a single functional case,--an oniric delirium, following a trench\r\nmortar explosion. Roselle and Oberthür also state on the basis of\r\nintensive experience, that large projectiles do not cause any intensive\r\nemotional reactions. Clunet’s observations upon the shipwrecked _La\r\nProvence II_, quoted by Babinski, run in the same direction. It will\r\nbe noted that the five cases called “hysteroemotive” showed a special\r\nconstitutional basis antebellum.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar strain; slight wound; burials; shell-shock: Neurosis with anxiety;\r\nwar dreams; apparent recovery. Relapse with depression.\r\n\r\n=Case 332.= (MACCURDY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man, 27 (normal mischievous boy, successful in work, unmarried, shy\r\nwith women), enlisted October, 1914; adapted himself well to training;\r\nat first enjoyed his work, though later bored with routine; and in\r\nFebruary, 1915, went to the firing line in France. The first shell-fire\r\nexperience made him break into a cold sweat with fear and slowed him\r\ndown for a time. However, he enjoyed the active operations until, after\r\neight months in the trenches, he was invalided home with nephritis.\r\nAfter four months’ convalescence he was recommended for a commission,\r\nobtained after two months’ training. After two further months in the\r\nregimental dépôt, he went back to France as lieutenant in June, 1916,\r\nplunging into four months of heavy fighting on the Somme, in which he\r\nwas wounded slightly once and was one day buried three times by earth\r\nfrom shell explosion. The last time he was buried he was unconscious\r\nfor ten minutes and was relieved for three days. He got frequently\r\nknocked out for short periods by shell concussion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of October, 1916, he was sent to the Ypres section, where\r\nhe worked with a pioneer battalion that buried many dead. After a\r\nmonth of this pioneer work he became mildly depressed; fatigue set in,\r\nand now for the first time he began to jump nervously when the shells\r\ncame over. To counteract this nervousness he began to drink and in a\r\nfortnight developed insomnia. The Somme front scenes kept constantly\r\nin mind as he tried to sleep. He felt as if he had to go up to the\r\ntrenches next day and that he did not want to go. There were hypnagogic\r\nhallucinations of trenches and shells, recognized as imaginary and\r\nproductive of no fear. Week by week he became more nervous, became\r\nunable to locate shell falls, and felt as if they were all coming at\r\nhim. Early in 1917 he had taken heavily to drink and grew greatly\r\nfatigued in the struggle to prevent betraying his fear to his men. The\r\nhorror at bloodshed, to which he had long since become accustomed,\r\nreappeared. He actually wished that he might be killed.\r\n\r\nHe carried on until March, when one day on a raid seven men were killed\r\naround him and he was immediately thereafter buried. He reported sick\r\nand was found to be somewhat febrile. He carried on for two more days;\r\nhad to report sick again; was sent to hospital and for two or three\r\nweeks had bad headaches back of the eyes and a sleep interrupted by\r\nsudden wakings with a start. Nightmares now began for the first time.\r\nThey dealt with the Somme front, merciless shelling coming nearer and\r\nnearer. Finally, he would wake with a shriek when a shell landed on\r\ntop of him. In the day time any noise would be interpreted as a shell.\r\nHypnagogic hallucinations of Germans entering the room appeared. After\r\na little over a week in French hospitals he was transferred to London;\r\ngrew better; was sent to a hospital in the country where outdoor\r\nexercise and recreation helped him.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later the death of one of his best friends depressed him\r\na good deal. He failed in an attempt to sing at a concert, and then\r\ngrew much worse, with the old dreams every night and hypochondriacal\r\ncomplaints of sweats and loss of weight. He was convinced that he was\r\nphysically and nervously a permanent wreck.\r\n\r\nAccording to MacCurdy, this case is a typical case of war neurosis of\r\nthe anxiety type, except that a relapse with depression is somewhat\r\natypical.\r\n\r\n_Re_ anxiety, Lépine counts trauma as one of the most important\r\nfactors. The reduction of morale in physically injured cases may at\r\ntimes require their rapid withdrawal to a safety zone. The delirium of\r\nthe physically injured sometimes takes on a melancholic tinge. Fatigue,\r\nloss of sleep, and cold are other factors of a physical nature. Among\r\nthe moral factors, Lépine thinks responsibility (for certain _âmes\r\nscrupuleuses_) is hardly less important than the factor of felt danger.\r\nThe contacts of highly cultivated men with the rougher soldier element,\r\nmay also count, as well as the separation from home and friends, and\r\nthe factor of despair concerning the ending of the war.\r\n\r\n_Re_ sexual influences, the factor of sexual continence, though it\r\nmay have some importance in producing morbid anxiety, seems to have\r\nless importance under war conditions, when self-preservation is more\r\nin the eye than the sexual life. On the whole, the pre-existent\r\nemotional constitution (Dupré) is of greater importance. A previous\r\nwound may cause a man to acquire such a constitution. Amongst physical\r\nstates, hypotensives are candidates for depression; tuberculosis is\r\nparticularly important.\r\n\r\n_Re_ MacCurdy’s case, the factor of alcoholism was mentioned. The\r\nimportance of alcoholism, Lépine has particularly stressed. He\r\nparticularly emphasizes the number of men who have taken to drink to\r\nget over their emotions and to forget. Visual hallucinations, angry\r\nexcitability, sudden persecutory ideas, nocturnal occurrence of the\r\nsymptoms, flushing of the face, suggest alcoholism. Some of the cases\r\nof encephalitis which are supposed to be due to some unknown bacterium,\r\nmay really be alcoholic in origin. A third of Lépine’s cases were\r\nalcoholic; perhaps two-thirds really alcoholic if one took into account\r\nthe factor of sensitization.\r\n\r\n\r\nBombardment from airplanes: Fear; suicidal thoughts; oniric delirium\r\n(“moving picture in the head.”)\r\n\r\n=Case 333.= (HOVEN, May, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier (born at seven months, somewhat feebleminded, given to\r\ndepression, early victim of convulsions, talking only at five years,\r\nwith a history of once leaving his father’s house with suicidal ideas\r\nafter being scolded, already invalided in peace times) on enlistment\r\nremained with the regiment but a few days and was then sent to a\r\nworkers’ company of blacksmiths.\r\n\r\nToward the end of February, 1916, his cantonment was bombarded by an\r\nairplane escadrille. The patient was much frightened, ran away and hid\r\nin a ditch, felt sick, stopped eating, wanted to kill himself and had\r\nto be evacuated to Calais and then to Chateaugiron.\r\n\r\nHe was there found to be well oriented, but depressed and bewildered.\r\nThere was an emotional tachycardia. At night he would fall into a\r\ndelirium like the oniric delirium of Régis, always dreaming of the same\r\nbombardment scene, saying it was like a _moving picture in his head_.\r\nThe delirium affected him so that he actually tried to make away with\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe dream delirium did not last long but recurred several times on very\r\nslight emotional occasions. It was possible to excite his hallucinatory\r\ndreams experimentally by showing him battle pictures.\r\n\r\nSome cases of such delirium develop, according to Hoven, after moving\r\npicture shows of battle scenes.\r\n\r\n_Re_ oniric delirium, Chavigny states that mental confusion and oniric\r\ndelirium are the two forms of mental disorder that come most frequently\r\nafter explosions. He believes that at least 95 per cent of these cases\r\nare rapidly curable; and, in fact, found amongst 60 cases observed in\r\nhis army service that only two were so severe as to require being sent\r\nto the interior: all the others were cured in six days at the outside.\r\nThese cases, according to Chavigny, ought to be treated in special\r\nwards at the front (bed, quiet, purgation, baths). Chavigny prearranges\r\nslight emotional shock for these cases by talking with them about their\r\nfamilies. Their apparent apathy vanishes in a trice.\r\n\r\nRégis, who has named the state “oniric delirium,” states that the\r\ncondition never lasts more than a fortnight, is caused by emotional\r\nshock, and occurs in all cases with mental disorder following battle;\r\nbut similar hallucinatory conditions have begun to appear also amongst\r\nalcoholics, in garrison or at home. There is emotional constitution in\r\nmost of these cases. There is not so much evidence of heredity. Out\r\nof 50 of Régis’ cases, 22 had been wounded, and 28 not. Régis states\r\nthat the psychoses are rather more apt to affect men in the reserve,\r\nand are severest in officers. These cases should not be committed to\r\ninstitutions, but ought to be treated in special military psychiatric\r\nwards containing separate rooms. Very fine-spun diagnosis may be\r\nnecessary now and again on account of the occurrence of infectious\r\ndeliria and phenomena of the banal psychoses that may closely resemble\r\noniric deliria.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; emotion (best friend mangled): Stupor with amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 334.= (GAUPP, March, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 23 (in civil life a turner, of Polish descent, and of a\r\nsomewhat nervous and easily excitable disposition), early in August\r\nwent from Strassburg into the Vosges and Lorraine. August 26 a number\r\nof shells exploded near him. The troop was excited and took refuge in\r\na cellar. His best friend was torn to pieces by a shell. When the body\r\nwas removed, the man felt sick and lost consciousness. He arrived at\r\nthe clinic in Tübingen in a stuporous condition, by hospital train,\r\nAugust 31, 1914. He walked weakly to his bed, supported by two men, and\r\nlay in the bed, apathetic and reacting to questions only with a stare.\r\nThings put in his mouth were swallowed. He remained motionless.\r\n\r\nNext evening he answered a low _Yes_ to a nurse’s question about\r\neating. A little afterwards, he said he supposed he was a prisoner in\r\nthe enemy’s country. A while later he got properly oriented but still\r\ndid not know how he had come. September 2, however, he was much clearer\r\nand said he had awakened out of a long dream. There was a complete\r\namnesia, however, from the moment when he went to help remove the torn\r\nbody of his friend up to September 1. Memories became clearer for the\r\nperiod before the shell explosion. The patient became very lively,\r\ntalking vividly of war experiences, imitating the hiss of shells with\r\nan expression of intense anxiety, getting accustomed to the battle\r\nscenes, saying that he was now seeing everything again as if real. He\r\nremained anxious for some days, complaining of weight on his chest and\r\nof feelings of inner restlessness and tension.\r\n\r\nAmnesia for the period August 26 to September 1 remained; all that he\r\ncould say was that he had been thrown sidewise for some distance by the\r\nair pressure of the shell.\r\n\r\nFrom September 6 onwards, he grew calmer but he was still very labile,\r\ngiven to lively imaginings and emotion. By mid September he could be\r\ndischarged for garrison duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional shock; shooting a comrade: Horror, sweat, stammer, recurrent\r\nnightmare. Improvement on “tracing back.” Brief recrudescence on death\r\nof child.\r\n\r\n=Case 335.= (ROWS, April, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man after a charge was placed on outpost duty. It was dark, and he\r\nwas in a state of considerable tension. He heard a noise which he\r\nthought came from somewhere in front of him. Suddenly the space around\r\nhim was illuminated by a flare of light, and he saw a man crawling\r\nover the bank. Without challenging, he fired and killed the man.\r\nNext morning, he found to his horror that he had killed a wounded\r\nEnglishman, who had advanced beyond his comrades and was crawling back.\r\n\r\nA physical expression of horror, together with an intense sweating and\r\na very marked stammer, persisted for months. At the same time, he was\r\ntormented with a fearful nightmare, and in his sleep he was heard to\r\nsay, “It was an accidental shot, sir; yes, Major, it was not my fault.”\r\nIn the day time, also, his attention was concentrated on the memory of\r\nthe incident, so that “I cannot forget it no matter how I skylark.”\r\nCarrying his story back to this trying time led to his recounting\r\nhis terrible secret, and a marked improvement followed. The physical\r\nsigns of the intense emotion gradually disappeared. The vividness of\r\nthe dreams diminished, and his attention was less concentrated on\r\nthe one subject. It is interesting to note that the production of a\r\nmarked emotional state by the death of one of his children led to a\r\nrecrudescence of his former symptoms: an expression of “horror and the\r\nstammer.” But they disappeared again in a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional shock: Phobias.\r\n\r\n=Case 336.= (BENNATI, October, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian corporal in the infantry, a robust man of a well-to-do\r\nfamily, took a good deal of pleasure in the war life. One day a\r\ncomrade was injured by a missile of some sort, and died almost\r\nimmediately. This comrade, after being hurt, had thrown himself\r\nagainst the corporal, who was asleep at the time. He woke up sharply\r\nand immediately felt sick. His status was one of great terror,\r\nlacrimation, lack of spontaneity, and insomnia. He would wake up from\r\nsleep and start from a terrible dream. He had a number of phobias and\r\nwas especially interested in other persons who had the same sort of\r\nmental state as himself. He was in a state noted by Bennati as one\r\nof “emotional anaphylaxis” to various events around him. There was a\r\nhorizontal nystagmus, the Mannkopf sign was positive (87-72), Thomayer\r\n90-114, Erben 114-90. There was a slight tendency to dizziness when the\r\nErben movements were made.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; fright: loss of consciousness next day: Generalized\r\ntremors; “somebody above with a mallet.”\r\n\r\n=Case 337.= (WILTSHIRE, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA sapper of 19, with a nervous mother, had had an attack two years\r\nbefore his war neurosis, of a somewhat similar nature. This former\r\nattack had been caused by overwork; there had been no accident or\r\nfright, but the man had been unable to work for five months.\r\n\r\nAt the front, he had been well up to ten days before observation. In\r\na dugout a shell had pitched on top of the bank, followed by another\r\nshell bursting in front. There was a slight falling in of the dugout\r\nbut no special damage.\r\n\r\nThe patient carried on that night but reported sick next morning,\r\nfeeling queer and shaking slightly above the waist. He remembered\r\ngetting half-way down the road to see the M. O., but nothing more until\r\nhe came to in the dressing station (perhaps 2½ hours later). After two\r\ndays in hospital, he was transferred to a convalescent camp, and then\r\nadmitted to another hospital. He complained of twitching and slight\r\nfrontal headache; funny feelings at night prevented his going to sleep.\r\nThus: “A man was over my head with a mallet, going to hit me.” There\r\nwas a dream of “somebody above me all the time.” Both arms, head,\r\nand tongue were in a state of constant tremor, and there were jerky\r\nmovements of the legs. There was some spasm of the right leg. Both legs\r\nwent into violent tremor on examination, and during examination there\r\nwas free perspiration.\r\n\r\n_Re_ tremors, all sorts of tremors of unknown nature are apt to get\r\nthe designation _hysterical_. Meige believes that the Shell-shock\r\ntremors, which are apt to be very persistent, are very possibly due to\r\nchanges in the nervous system. Ballet has noted how the tremors, as\r\nin the above case, are often associated with expressions of fear. Now\r\nand then there is an obsessive disorder dubbed tremophobia by Meige,\r\nwhich produces a vicious circle. Tremors lead to obsessions, and the\r\nobsessions in turn exaggerate the tremors. These Shell-shock tremors\r\nare apparently not related to (though they may need differential\r\ndiagnosis from) such conditions as paralysis agitans, multiple\r\nsclerosis, hyperthyroidism, cerebellar disease, neurosyphilis, and\r\nalcoholic or other intoxication.\r\n\r\nRoussy and Lhermitte distinguish the tremors into (_a_) atypical ones;\r\nthat is, disorderly, irregular movements seemingly determined by the\r\nsubject’s caprice; and (_b_) typical tremors, such as those found in\r\nthe well-known nervous diseases and presumably imitated in hysteria\r\nfrom these well-known diseases. Generalized atypical tremors are, as a\r\nrule, combined with a variety of other Shell-shock symptoms, and often\r\nexhibit a sort of mimicry of fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; burial-work: Amnesia. Shell whistling conditions idea of\r\nsomething nasty.\r\n\r\n=Case 338.= (WILTSHIRE, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private, 19, in the R. A. M. C., was sent in with a field ambulance\r\nnote as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Private ---- was close to a shell which burst among a company\r\n    standing in the road, killing 20 and wounding 20 others. He\r\n    worked well in assisting the wounded, and then proceeded to\r\n    clear up the fragments of the killed. Whilst doing this, he\r\n    suddenly lost his mental balance and has been in his present\r\n    state nearly 24 hours. He has been given bromides.”\r\n\r\n    An M. O. attached to the same ambulance wrote: “This man is\r\n    suffering from mental shock caused by having to clear away\r\n    the remains of a number of men killed by a shell. He does not\r\n    recognize his friends, and at frequent intervals has periods\r\n    of terror, exclaiming, ‘Cover it up.’ He is sleepless (without\r\n    drugs); he takes food badly. He is possibly suicidal or may\r\n    become so.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the patient himself, he had been quite well for four\r\nmonths at the front. He was on the La Bassée Road with the troops after\r\na day or two of heavy work under shell fire. “And I remember the flash\r\nof some shot and a shell burst I think, and I can’t remember anything\r\nmore. I awoke in the morning, in the train” (48 hours later). “I can\r\nonly remember men calling out.” He complained of a feeling in the\r\nhead, as if expecting something. “Something seems to be coming,--as\r\nif something was going to happen,--something nasty, whenever I hear\r\nanything like the whistling of a shell coming towards me.” This patient\r\nwas without tremor and was physically normal. So far as the patient’s\r\nown story went, the case might well be regarded as one due to physical\r\nconcussion, but the notes of the medical officers give evidence of a\r\npsychic element.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepression with suicidal thoughts after witnessing death of comrade.\r\n\r\n=Case 339.= (STEINER, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA farmer, 52, volunteered and was put in charge of a drinking-water\r\nstill. He had never been ill nor was there any nervous or mental\r\ndisease in his family. From the end of August he was frequently under\r\nshell fire, but the only effect thereof was a somewhat poorer sleep\r\nthan normal.\r\n\r\nDecember 14, 1914, a young comrade, a volunteer, wanted to clean his\r\ndirty kettle at the drinking-water still. The farmer later described\r\nthis volunteer as a young fellow “like milk and blood” (as we might\r\nsay, “like peaches and cream”) and as the handsomest young man he had\r\never seen in the war. The rules forbade such use of the still, and\r\nyoung “milk-and-blood” was told to go down to the brook, and then come\r\nback and get the distilled water. The young man complied, but while at\r\nthe brook he was shot and killed in full sight of the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe farmer grew much excited and trembled all over. Thereafter he could\r\nnot eat or sleep; he reproached himself, although he knew he had acted\r\nquite correctly; wished he had been in the place of this comrade;\r\nand had suicidal thoughts. He was deeply depressed, wept easily,\r\nand showed manual tremor. Steiner terms the farmer’s account of the\r\nperson of the deceased “reactive idealization.” After a week there was\r\nconsiderable improvement. B. was sent back to work, which he felt would\r\nbe beneficial. He was put in less dangerous surroundings, and this also\r\nhad a good effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarching and battles: Neurasthenia?\r\n\r\n=Case 340.= (BONHOEFFER, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA subaltern had been treated before the war for nervousness, dizziness,\r\nand “mattigkeit” (convulsions in infancy), but proved himself a good\r\nsoldier, having gotten his rank after the first period of practice.\r\n\r\nHe was in three battles in Belgium, but on the march one day suddenly\r\nhad a spell of weakness and is said to have had convulsions. There was,\r\nhowever, no biting of the tongue, and no enuresis. After a week in the\r\nfield hospital, he was sent back to Berlin where he had some somatic\r\nfeelings of anxiety without subjective disturbance or any disorders of\r\nconsciousness except a certain amount of inhibition; he was sleepless\r\nand hypersensitive, cried easily, and was apprehensive on being\r\ntouched; he winked violently on examination of his eyes, and while\r\nbeing tested for reflexes made violent contractions of a semi-voluntary\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAfter four days in bed, which was a prescription hard to carry out\r\nat first on account of the anxiety sensations, these sensations\r\ndisappeared, and at the same time the fears. Weight began to increase;\r\nmemories returned, except that even upon recovery he could not remember\r\nthat he had ever had any true subjective feelings of fear. He was\r\ndischarged 19 days later, desirous of going back into the field.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar absence of subjective feelings of fear in this case is\r\nsomething like what Awtokratow reported from the Russo-Japanese War,\r\nterming them neurasthenic psychoses.\r\n\r\n_Re_ neurasthenia, Babinski believes that, by means of his logical\r\ndismembering of the old hysteria concept, he has shown that the\r\nexhaustion phenomena at the bottom of neurasthenia are precisely these\r\nthat cannot be cured by suggestion. There are numerous cases in which\r\nhysteria and neurasthenia are combined. From these combined cases,\r\nsuggestion causes the hysterical or pithiatic symptoms to be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish schoolmaster’s account of his war dreams.\r\n\r\n=Case 341.= (MOTT, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant, who had been a schoolmaster, was asked to write down his\r\ndreams by Captain W. Brown, who had sometimes charge of Mott’s cases at\r\nthe Maudsley Hospital. The first dream was as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I appeared to be resting on the roadside when a woman\r\n    (unknown) called me to see her husband’s (a comrade) body which\r\n    was about to be buried. I went to a field in which was a pit,\r\n    and near the edge four or five dead bodies. In a hand-cart\r\n    nearby was a _legless body_, the head of which was hidden from\r\n    sight by a slab of stone. [He had seen a _legless body_, which\r\n    was covered with a mackintosh sheet, which he removed.] On\r\n    moving the stone I found the body alive, and the head spoke to\r\n    me, imploring me to see that it was not buried. Burial party\r\n    arrived, and I was myself about to be buried with legless body\r\n    when I awoke.”\r\n\r\nThe second dream was as follows:\r\n\r\n    “After spending an evening with a brother (dead 11 years\r\n    ago) I was making my way home when a violent storm compelled\r\n    me to take shelter in a kind of culvert, which later turned\r\n    into a quarry, situated between two houses. Men were doing\r\n    blasting operations in the quarry, and whilst watching them I\r\n    saw great upheavals of rock, and eventually the building all\r\n    around collapsed (explosion of a mine). Amongst the débris\r\n    were several mutilated bodies, the most prominent of which was\r\n    _legless_. I tried to proceed to the body, but found that I was\r\n    myself pinned down by masonry which had fallen on top of me.\r\n    As I struggled to get free the whole scene appeared to change\r\n    to a huge fire, everything being enveloped in flames, and\r\n    through the flames I could still see the _legless body_ which\r\n    now bore the _head of my wife_, who was calling for me. I was\r\n    struggling to get free when my _mother_ seemed to be coming to\r\n    my assistance, and I awoke to find the nurses and orderlies\r\n    standing over me.”\r\n\r\nIt appears that the patient had been shouting in his sleep, beginning\r\nin a low voice and gradually becoming louder until at last he was\r\nshrieking. The _legless body_ occurred in all his dreams; the sight of\r\nthis had evidently produced a profound emotional shock. He had worried\r\na great deal about his wife, who was much younger than himself, so that\r\nwe have this incongruous association of the _legless body_ and the\r\n_head_ of his wife calling him; finally, what more natural than the\r\n_mother_ to come to his help. The emotional complex is not incongruous\r\nin this dream, for fear is linked up with the tender emotion.\r\n\r\n_Re_ war dreams, see remarks under Case 333 concerning oniric delirium.\r\nRoussy and Lhermitte say that emotion and concussion are the causal\r\nfactors; but in a case like 341 we have persistent war dreams of the\r\nsame general nature. Such a case as Mott’s would not be regarded as one\r\nof oniric delirium, for the patient is not living throughout the day in\r\na dream, but merely has certain set dreams. The true oniric delirium\r\ncases may lead to fugues of medicolegal importance. Mott’s conception\r\nis that the terrifying experiences that come to light in the dreams are\r\nrepressed by the conscious activity of the mind in the waking state.\r\nFor this process, the phrase _psychic trauma_ might be used. Rows\r\nspeaks of a prolongation of mental disorder through memories which get\r\nrevived in dreams. The memories of past and recent events pile up on\r\none another. Elliot Smith remarks on the number of cases in which the\r\ndreams show a coalescence and blending of episodes alien to the war.\r\n_Re_ such combinations, see Case 342 of Rows, below.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrench experience: War dreams, shifting to sex dreams. Recovery on\r\ngiving the patient an insight into the nature of his dreams.\r\n\r\n=Case 342.= (ROWS, April, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA patient broke out of a hospital after being refused permission\r\nto leave the grounds. He grew much depressed and said he had been\r\ndisgraced and would commit suicide rather than bring disgrace on his\r\nfamily. Investigation into this emotional outburst showed that his\r\nfather had deserted the family, that he had gotten into prison, and\r\n“tainted me.” The patient was worried also about an idea of loss of\r\nsex power, gathered from a book by a quack doctor, read years ago.\r\nIt appeared also that this doctor had advertised a special bread and\r\nspecial medicine which would preserve the nervous system, and that for\r\nyears the patient had fed himself and his family with the bread and\r\nmedicine. When the true state of affairs was shown to the patient, his\r\nrestlessness at night disappeared. The mental condition of this man in\r\nfact became practically normal, and the marked tic of facial muscles\r\nand the general tremulousness of the man disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt is of note that this man’s dreams began with a terrible incident in\r\nthe trenches and then shifted to sex acts. He woke to find the clothes\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of hallucinations dispelled by tracing them to their\r\nsource, and giving the patient a clear insight into their nature.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ballet and de Fursac, after the acute phase of stupor\r\nand excitement with hallucinations and delirium passes, the patient\r\nremains a depressed and psychasthenic subject. In this psychasthenia\r\nwe find inhibitory phenomena, hyperemotionalism, and over-imagination.\r\nAmongst the inhibitory phenomena are many of the hysterical effects.\r\nThe hyperemotionalism yields anxiety, worry, tremors, respiratory\r\nand vasomotor disorder, dizziness, convulsions. The third main\r\ndisorder of the psychasthenic state into which the patient relapses\r\nis over-imagination, whereunder we find bad dreams (bombardments,\r\ndrum-beating, corpses, attacks), somnambulistic hallucinatory episodes.\r\nIt is these hyperemotional and hyperfantastic features that distinguish\r\nthe Shell-shock syndrome from ordinary psychasthenic states.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the sex element in this case, see remarks under preceding case\r\n(341) and also Lépine on the sex factor (Case 332). Rows believes that\r\nthose cases which do not recover after a short period of rest and quiet\r\nin hospital are cases in which there is some emotional state based upon\r\nthe constant intrusion of the memory of some past event. The physical\r\nexpression of the emotion of fear or terror may persist for a long time\r\nquite unchanged and be proved to be due to this old factor.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotional shock: Recurrent dreams of war and peace incidents. Recovery\r\nfollowed tracing the dreams to their origin.\r\n\r\n=Case 343.= (ROWS, April, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier and a comrade were carrying a pail of water to the trenches.\r\nIt was very cold and they set down the pail in order to warm their\r\nhands. The comrade placed his hand against the man’s cheek and said,\r\n“That hand is cold.” At that moment he was shot dead.\r\n\r\nThis incident was involved not only in dreams at night, but in the\r\ndaytime too, if he were quiet and closed his eyes, he could feel the\r\ncold hand against his face.\r\n\r\nHe was troubled at the same time by another dream, in which he ran\r\ndown a narrow lane at the bottom of which there was a well. He dipped\r\nhis hands into the water, but on withdrawing them, he was horrified\r\nto find they were covered with blood. This dream was connected with a\r\nlove affair, in which a good friend interfered and angered him so much\r\nthat he attacked him when next they met. He left him on the ground so\r\ninjured that it was necessary to take him to a hospital. The patient\r\nbecame anxious as to what the result might be and left the district. He\r\ntraveled, but never heard whether his victim had died.\r\n\r\nWhen these two dreams were traced back to their origin they\r\ndisappeared: the patient made a rapid recovery and was able afterwards\r\nto bear a severe trial satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nSee remarks under Case 342.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar dreams, including hunger and thirst.\r\n\r\n=Case 344.= (MOTT, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\n(_Recorded Dream of a Second Lieutenant._)\r\n\r\n“During the five days spent in the village of Roeux I was continually\r\nunder our own shell fire and also continually liable to be discovered\r\nby the enemy, who was also occupying the village. Each night I\r\nattempted to get through his lines without being observed, but failed.\r\nOn the fourth day my sergeant was killed at my side by a shell. On the\r\nfifth day I was rescued by our troops while I was unconscious. During\r\nthis time I had had nothing to drink or eat, with the exception of\r\nabout a pint of water.\r\n\r\n“At the present time I am subject to dreams in which I hear these\r\nshells bursting and whistling through the air. I also continually see\r\nmy sergeant, both alive and dead, and also my attempts to return are\r\nvividly pictured. I sometimes have in my dreams that feeling of intense\r\nhunger and thirst which I had in the village. When I awaken I feel as\r\nthough all strength had left me and am in a cold sweat.\r\n\r\n“For a time after awaking I fail to realize where I am and the\r\nsurroundings take on the form of the ruins in which I remained hidden\r\nfor so long.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes I do not think that I thoroughly awaken, as I seem to doze\r\noff, and there are the conflicting ideas that I am in the hospital, and\r\nagain that I am in France.\r\n\r\n“During the day, if I sit doing nothing in particular and I find myself\r\ndozing, my mind seems to immediately begin to fly back to France.\r\n\r\n“A dream that keeps on coming up in my mind is one that brings back\r\na motor accident I had about six years ago, which gave me a severe\r\nnervous shock. I had, of course, entirely forgotten about it, except\r\nwhen in a motor, when I always thought of it.\r\n\r\n“Of the fifth day I have absolutely no recollections.”\r\n\r\nThis is the one instance in which a man has dreamt the experience of\r\nhunger and thirst in addition to battle experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nOlfactory dreams: Hysterical vomiting.\r\n\r\n=Case 345.= (WILTSHIRE, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant in the infantry (mother, of a nervous disposition) had\r\nbeen at the front for 3½ months when he started vomiting everything he\r\nate.\r\n\r\nHe was transferred a fortnight later to a base hospital as “gastritis.”\r\nPhysical examination proved negative, but the man complained of his\r\nnerves. He slept badly owing to trench-life dreams, from which he would\r\nwake in a sweat. He was quite unwilling to refer to these dreams.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact he had had to supervise the burial of many decomposing\r\nbodies, after which he had been haunted “by that awful smell of the\r\ndead.” Then developed states of abstraction, in which he went over and\r\nover the burying experience. He cried by himself.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the vomiting was secondary to hysterical hallucinations.\r\n\r\n_Re_ affections of smell and taste, Roussy and Lhermitte remark that\r\nthey are rare following shock or trauma in war. Medical suggestion may\r\nproduce a hemiageusia or a hemianosmia. Mott’s case above (344) showed\r\nunusual dreams with hunger and thirst. For another olfactory case, see\r\nCase 510 (Rivers) in the Treatment Section of the book, a case in which\r\nRivers was able to find no redeeming feature upon which to ground his\r\nre-educative suggestions.\r\n\r\n_Re_ vomiting, Roussy and Lhermitte state that this relatively common\r\ncondition is diagnosticated readily enough but that pyloric ulcer and\r\nother organic causes must be eliminated. They remark that there is\r\nno tendency to spontaneous cure of neuropathic vomiting, and commend\r\nstrict dietetic régime and psychotherapy. They ally the condition in\r\nits nature and genesis with so-called false or hysterical incontinence\r\nof urine in soldiers. Wiltshire’s case early received the diagnosis\r\n“gastritis.” It is remarkable how little emaciation need follow such\r\nvomiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Amnesia; dreams of falling. POST-ONIRIC\r\nsuggestion--surprise produced fear of falling.\r\n\r\n=Case 346.= (DUPRAT, October, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man was subjected to shell-shock August 11, 1916, at the Somme. He\r\nlost consciousness for five hours and was picked up stuporous with\r\nverbal amnesia, which soon passed leaving only a difficulty in getting\r\nthe right word promptly. He began to have frightful dreams of falling\r\ninto a hole and of exertions to avoid falling, whereupon he would awake\r\nwith a feeling of anxiety that would last some time. Treatment caused\r\nthe dreams to disappear.\r\n\r\nThere remained, however, a powerful _post-oniric_ suggestion. Any\r\nslight surprise would cause the fear of falling to reappear. There was\r\na sort of derived phobia, against any military act that would need to\r\nbe performed upon sudden order. He developed a blind anger against any\r\ncommanding officer who gave a brusque order. After the crisis of anger\r\nhe would fall into tears and a feeling of profound depression coupled\r\nwith precordial anxiety. There was also a chronic aortitis physically\r\ndetermined. The man himself had a vague idea of the relationship of his\r\nfear of surprise to the old nightmares.\r\n\r\n_Re_ persistence of fear and its relationship to nightmares, see\r\nremarks under Case 342 (ROWS).\r\n\r\n\r\nFour months’ SERVICE IN THE REAR: Depression; war HALLUCINATIONS (not\r\nbased upon actual experiences); psychasthenic symptoms.\r\n\r\n=Case 347.= (GERVER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian lieutenant, 32, arrived at the front in November, 1914, but\r\nnever served on the front line, or had occasion to visit the line or\r\nthe trenches. Toward the close of February, mental symptoms appeared,\r\nwhich caused the man’s evacuation to the interior.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, well-built, well-nourished man, who was physically\r\nnormal except for sharp twitching movements of the tongue, eyelids, and\r\nface; tremors of extended hands, occasionally spreading to the whole\r\nbody; well-defined dermatographia (in places, stereodermatographia);\r\nexaggerated tendon reflexes; tenderness of skull and spine;\r\nhyperesthesia of chest; pulse 120.\r\n\r\nMentally, the patient was markedly depressed, irritable, at times\r\nlacrimose. His complaints were of a psychasthenic tinge. He feared\r\nincurable disease. He feared to go to the front, and was terrified at\r\nwhat he might do there. He feared crowds of soldiers; he was afraid\r\nof forests and mountains; the Germans were going to break through and\r\ncapture him; shells were about to burst over his head. He was also\r\ndisturbed about his family, regarding his wife and son as helpless,\r\nsometimes even as dead. Suicidal thoughts at times.\r\n\r\nAt night, though he had never been at the front, he had hallucinations\r\nof shots and the voices of soldiers, as well as those of his wife\r\nand son. He smelt an unpleasant corpse-like odor. He was unable to\r\ndistinguish these hallucinations in any respect from reality. He\r\ncomplained of general weakness, headaches, palpitation of the heart,\r\nvertigo, and insomnia, and of a variety of pains.\r\n\r\nHe was non-alcoholic and non-syphilitic, and had been in perfect health\r\nbefore the war.\r\n\r\n_Re_ war hallucinations with service back of the line, compare remarks\r\nof Régis (see under Case 333).\r\n\r\n\r\nA case of hysterical astasia-abasia develops “big belly”\r\n(“catiemophrenosis”), perhaps by hetero-suggestion from a ward neighbor.\r\n\r\n=Case 348.= (ROUSSY, BOISSEAU and CORNIL, May, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA farmer, 22, of the foot chasseurs, who had been in various hospitals\r\nwith a variety of diseases before his injury, was evacuated June 2,\r\n1916, for “contusion of back,” to the temporary hospital at Bussant,\r\nfrom which he was evacuated to Pontarlier for “contusion of back and\r\ncerebellar shock” and thence, July 21, to Besançon for “internal\r\ncontusion and cerebellar shock”; thence to four other hospitals from\r\nJuly 31 to February 17, 1917; finally to the Hospital at Veilpicard\r\nwith “functional disorders, paraplegia, trepidant astasia-abasia.”\r\n\r\nIt seems that he had lost consciousness for fifteen days and had\r\nthereafter been paraplegic with retention of urine. The abdomen\r\nhad then increased in size in such wise as to be termed a nervous\r\npregnancy, _grossesse nerveuse_. The evolution of this pseudotympanites\r\nwas probably related to the presence of the same so-called “big belly”\r\nof a patient who had been in a neighboring bed from May, 1916, onwards.\r\nThe feet were in equine position with toes flexed, suggestive in all\r\nways of hysterical paraplegia. The abdomen looked like that of a woman\r\nsix months pregnant and measured 78 centimeters in a plane passing\r\nthrough the anterosuperior iliac spines and the umbilicus. The abdomen\r\nwas hard, tense, swollen, and on palpation, gave out a low, tympanic\r\nnote. When the diaphragm was mobilized progressively and slowly, the\r\ntympanites could be made to disappear. Slow pressure on the abdomen\r\nwith flat hands effaced the swelling for the time being; but upon\r\nrelease of the hands the abdomen would swell up again as before.\r\nPressure on the abdomen produced a contracture of the recti. Forced\r\nflexion of thighs on pelvis (as suggested by Denéchau and Matrais) also\r\ncaused the swelling to go down. Faradization of the phrenic nerves\r\nin the neck caused respiratory movements with a slight diminution\r\nin the volume of the abdomen. There was an obstinate constipation\r\nrequiring daily lavage. Respiratory movements were short and rapid and\r\nof the thoracic type. Abdominal compression caused the respiration to\r\nassume almost a normal rhythm. X-ray examination of the abdomen, after\r\n50 grams of bismuth carbonate had been taken in three spaced doses\r\nthe evening before, showed the intestine to be distended by gas in\r\nsuch wise that the lower border of the liver became clearly visible,\r\nas after insufflation of the stomach. The bismuth was found in the\r\nlarge intestine. The splenic angle filled with bismuth was low. On\r\ncompression the splenic angle was raised with the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe main features of this disease are the large abdomen, simulating\r\nwhat has hitherto been found chiefly in females under the name of\r\nnervous pregnancy, but also suggesting a tuberculous peritonitis (one\r\npatient was actually evacuated to a hospital for tuberculosis with this\r\ndisease); gastro-intestinal disorder with aerophagy, aerocoly, and\r\nobstinate constipation (one case also showed almost daily vomiting).\r\nThe genesis of the condition appears to be a contracture of the\r\ndiaphragm in a low position of forced inspiration. The condition may be\r\ntermed a diaphragmatic neurosis.\r\n\r\nPsychotherapy was applied, the patient was requested to walk, and\r\nthe movements made in walking required such an intense respiration\r\nthat the diaphragm was forced to function, whereupon the “big belly”\r\ndisappeared. The digestive disorders then rapidly disappeared. These\r\nauthors suggest the name of _catiemophrenosis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar stress; collapse going over the top: Neurasthenia (hereditary\r\ntaint; alcoholism).\r\n\r\n=Case 349.= (JOLLY, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA German soldier, 35, of a nervous make-up (his mother was nervous, and\r\nhe had been nervous and tremulous and easily excitable, and alcoholic\r\nto the extent of at least 5 glasses of beer every night), was called\r\nto the colors in September, 1914. He got through his training well;\r\nin May, 1915, was on very strenuous duty in a very exposed position,\r\nhad frequently to stand up under heavy shelling, had a number of\r\nfrightful experiences, was surrounded by corpses and mutilated bodies,\r\nand frequently took part in storming attacks. His nervousness came\r\nto a head with some suddenness; just as he was about to “go over the\r\ntop,” he had no strength for the effort and collapsed. Thereafter he\r\ncould no longer stand shelling, could not speak, and was inattentive to\r\nsurroundings. When he was examined by a physician he fell asleep in his\r\npresence, although sleep had latterly been almost impossible on account\r\nof the shelling. He was immediately put on the hospital train and taken\r\nto the reserve hospital in Nuremberg, where he presented an appearance\r\nof extreme exhaustion, wept, seemed much fatigued, and trembled all\r\nover whenever he started to do anything. He was very easily excited and\r\nespecially sensitive to noise. There was a fine tremor of the whole\r\nbody and especially of the head; the knee-jerks were increased; there\r\nwas a moderate vasomotor reddening of the skin after stroking; his\r\ntongue was heavily coated; but there was no other evidence of internal\r\ndisorder. His pulse was strong and not rapid.\r\n\r\nThe patient got well gradually, complained at first of bad dreams, and\r\nwas given to weeping. The tremors slowly improved. The patient grew\r\nbetter in a hospital at home.\r\n\r\nAs to the diagnosis of this case, Jolly regards it as one of nervous\r\nexhaustion. The remarkable feature is the tardiness with which the\r\nsymptoms developed under the stress of war. Such a patient would\r\nprobably never develop a neurasthenia under normal peace conditions.\r\nAfter recovery these patients may be sent back for garrison duty or\r\nfor other work not directly connected with the firing line. As for the\r\ntendency to desire a pension, this wish, according to Jolly, must be\r\nstrenuously opposed, both in the interest of the state and that of the\r\npatient. If there is no will to get well, some of these patients are\r\nfound vibrating from garrison service to furlough and to hospital.\r\n\r\nThe above case is one of the simplest observed; yet there is evidence\r\nboth of hereditary taint and of alcoholism. According to Jolly, the\r\nmajority of the severe exhaustion states of a neurasthenic nature\r\nhave been, in his experience, distinctly nervous before the war, and\r\nfrequently show hereditary taint as well.\r\n\r\n_Re_ neurasthenia, see views of Babinski relative to differentiation\r\nfrom hysteria (under Case 340).\r\n\r\n\r\nSeries of battles: Sudden mania followed by confusion with fixation of\r\nmind upon war experiences, possibly hallucinatory; general analgesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 350.= (GERVER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian private, looking much older than his years (35), had been\r\nin a number of battles without mental disorder. Where he was posted,\r\nhowever, there was a heavy artillery fire in the last of the battles.\r\nSuddenly the man became excited and leaped upon his comrades’ shoulders\r\ncrying, “The devil is here! This is hell and murder, and here are\r\nthe devil’s imps!” The commanding officer accordingly ordered him to\r\nthe rear. His regiment had suffered severe losses in a succession of\r\nattacks upon a certain strategic height.\r\n\r\nUpon evacuation to the field hospital and thence to the interior, his\r\nexcitement did not lessen. He went about with a lost look, trembling,\r\ntalking a great deal and gesticulating. His talk was incoherent and\r\npointless. After every few phrases, he would repeat, “Don’t ride there!\r\nThat’s hell! Murder is being done. Devils and unholy powers are beating\r\nand killing people.” As he said this, he would tremble, and hands and\r\nfeet would stiffen with a suggestion of catalepsy. There was general\r\nanesthesia to pain; no response was made to deep pin-pricks. The pupils\r\nwere dilated and failed to react, either to light or to pain. The\r\ntendon reflexes were exaggerated. No contraction of visual fields. The\r\nman was disoriented for time and place and much confused. No paralysis.\r\nNo wound or contusion.\r\n\r\n_Re_ analgesia, we may only say that hysterical anesthesia appears in\r\na variety of forms; sometimes (_a_) in the form of a classical stigma\r\nof hemi-anesthesia; (_b_) in a segmentary form; again (_c_) in isolated\r\npatches; (_d_) in a very rough way approximating the peripheral nerve\r\ndistributions. Babinski gives an unpublished note by Lasègue, in which\r\nhe states that hysterical patients not enlightened by the doctor’s\r\ninvestigations do not make mention of anesthesia. But in case 350 a\r\npsychotic factor may have entered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen months of military service (several battles) without reaction;\r\nthen, hot machine gun battle: Mania with disorientation and war\r\nhallucinations.\r\n\r\n=Case 351.= (GERVER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian private, 24, in a scout company, entered the war on\r\nmobilization and took part in several battles without reaction. May\r\n11, 1915, he was sent with the scout party into a hot encounter, hand\r\nto hand with machine-guns. After the battle, the man began to yell\r\nincoherent phrases at the men around him, started to climb over the\r\ntop, and shot off his gun without permission. He was accordingly sent\r\nto hospital, where he was under observation for a week, during which\r\nhe had occasional flashes of excitement, jumping out of bed and making\r\nmovements of cutting or shooting, and then in a few minutes subsiding\r\ninto inactivity.\r\n\r\nHe was a short but well-built and well-nourished man; the pupils\r\nresponded rather weakly in accommodation; there was a small fibrillar\r\ntremor of the face, eyes, and tongue. The skin reflexes were\r\ndiminished and there was a general hypalgesia; considerable mechanical\r\noverexcitability of muscles; no other neurological disorders. The\r\nmental state was one of confusion. Although he was in one of the corps\r\nhospitals, he said he was in a dug-out; the doctors were lieutenants;\r\nthe attendants were privates in his company. Answers to questions\r\nwere irrelevant or incoherent; there were a number of delusional\r\nexpressions. He was to be shot because he had not himself shot enough\r\nGermans. If he were not to be shot, anyhow the soldiers would poison\r\nhim. Rather than this he should be allowed to go into an attack. He\r\nwould take a German fort and the Czar would name him a colonel. His\r\nregimental commander was saying to him, “You will be a hero, you will\r\nsoon get a company.” His hallucinations sometimes included the voices\r\nof Germans saying, in broken Russian, “We will hang you and cut your\r\nbelly open!” There was considerable amnesia for dates and even his last\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerous attacks and counter attacks in one day: Sudden incoherence\r\nwith disorientation and the rapid development of war hallucinations of\r\na scenic type. Suggestion of catatonic phenomena.\r\n\r\n=Case 352.= (GERVER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian lieutenant, 28 (no mental disease, non-alcoholic), was in\r\nbattle August 14, 1914, on which day his company attacked and was\r\nitself attacked several times. An officer who observed the lieutenant\r\nsaid that he came to him and informed him that the Germans must first\r\nbe burned and then fought with. Thereafter the lieutenant began to\r\nspeak loudly and incoherently, sometimes yelling incoherent orders.\r\nHe was accordingly removed from the battle-field to the hospital back\r\nof the line. Upon examination, he was found to be of middle height,\r\nwith dilated pupils, responding weakly to light and not at all to\r\naccommodation; twitchings of face, eyelids, and tongue, digital tremor,\r\nmarked dermatographia, general analgesia, tendon reflexes somewhat\r\nexaggerated, cataleptic tendency in feet and hands.\r\n\r\nMentally, the patient was in a stupor, sitting or standing in one\r\nplace, without initiative; uncomplaining but occasionally uttering deep\r\nsighs or occasional isolated phrases. He answered no questions or only\r\nafter a long pause. He was disoriented for time and place, but gave\r\nevidence of delusions and hallucinations. He thought, for example,\r\nthat he was the chief of staff and had brought with him a squad of\r\ncaptured Germans who were standing nearby. Some wanted to be fed and\r\nlet go; others were yelling and saying they would burn down the house.\r\nSometimes the patient would hear shots and shells bursting, at which\r\nhe would shudder and turn away. Apparently he would see his comrades\r\nfalling under the shrapnel hail. However, he stood his ground and\r\ncommanded the rest of the soldiers to go forward to the attack. Now\r\nand then he was negativistic, flexing the hands upon request to extend\r\nthem, refusing food and drink. He was still apathetic on evacuation to\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock after two days in trenches: Hysterical STUPOR seven days.\r\nCure in three weeks, barring amnesia for stuporous period.\r\n\r\n=Case 353.= (GAUPP, March, 1915.)\r\n\r\nF. S., in civil life a wreath-binder in a flower shop, and from\r\nchildhood very nervous and excited, subject to frequent nosebleeds and\r\nfainting spells (_e.g._, at sight of blood), enlisted at 22, November\r\n3, 1914, as a reservist. January 18 he went into the field.\r\n\r\nThe wreath-binder was only two days in the trenches before going\r\nunconscious under the whistling and exploding shells. Physically\r\nuninjured, he was received in reserve hospital C in a deep stupor,\r\nJanuary 22. He was unresponsive at first, once however saying, lost in\r\na dream, “When will mother come?” His gait was unsteady and he had to\r\nbe led and held. He slept a good deal in the daytime.\r\n\r\nHe became somewhat more active mentally, January 24 (remarking that\r\nhe had slept well), and made his toilet, but he did not yet have\r\nbearings and wanted to go to his place of business. The next day his\r\ncondition was similar. Asked what troop he was with, he said, “In\r\nthe flower business.” January 26 he was much better, telling of the\r\narmy training and a little about the war, and wrote a postcard to his\r\nparents. The stupor disappeared after January 27 and the patient became\r\nmentally normal. Amnesia persisted for the time, January 20 to 26.\r\nHeadaches. February 9 he was well, except for the limited amnesia still\r\npersisting. He was eventually sent back to garrison duty, cured.\r\n\r\n_Re_ stupor, Grandclaude remarks that stupor is probably the most\r\nfrequent of the mental symptoms of Shell-shock, and that it may\r\nlast from a few moments to a week. During the stupor the patient is\r\nasthenic, stertorous, and staring. Upon recovery from the stupor, a\r\ncondition of dulness with amnesia and disorientation ensues. There may\r\nbe a third phase of a more hyperkinetic character, with hallucinations\r\nand delusions concerning the war. These stuporous cases are among\r\nthe most serious of the conditions found, as some of the victims may\r\neven suggest dementia praecox from the persistence of childishness\r\nand silliness. As in Gaupp’s case, Grandclaude finds that headaches\r\nand amnesia persist. Relapses are frequent on the basis of a kind of\r\nsensitization.\r\n\r\n_Re_ amnesia and Shell-shock, Roussy and Lhermitte speak of amnesia\r\nas ordinarily a phenomenon of confusion. Amongst the mental disorders\r\nof the Shell-shock psychoses, these authors describe a group due\r\nto inhibition or diminution of mental activity, including the rare\r\nnarcolepsy, or pathological sleep, and the confusional states proper.\r\nSimple confusion involves slowness in thinking, and amnesia often\r\nanterograde from the moment of the shock. Simple confusion ought to be\r\ndistinguished from so-called “obtusion” or torpor, in which there is a\r\ndisorientation for time and space, such as was shown in Mallet’s case.\r\nChavigny has described an aprosexic form (with “birdlike” movements).\r\nMore common is the amnestic form of torpor. The amnesia may not merely\r\nbe anterograde from the moment of shock, but may extend to a prolonged\r\nperiod prior to the accident. Sometimes the amnesias are selective,\r\nproducing phenomena of pseudo aphasia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmnesia, monosymptomatic. Progressive recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 354.= (MALLET, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 36, arrived without information at a psychiatric\r\ncenter, March 15, 1916, looking confused and knowing little more than\r\nhis name, believing himself in a distant town. The disorientation\r\nlasted to March 21, on which day the man recognized the doctor as such,\r\nknew that he was at a hospital, but felt that he had just left home\r\nand wife. From this time on, he began to pick up his surroundings,\r\nevidently not knowing that there was a war or that he was a soldier.\r\nHe did not recognize one of his own company. It was not until March 31\r\nthat the first memory of the war reappeared, namely, a memory of the\r\ncall to the colors, drums, bells, and crowds. April 11 he recollected\r\nthat he was a soldier and that his wife was in the country, where he\r\nhad left her on the eleventh day of the mobilization. In the next few\r\ndays, memories came back bit by bit. He had been at first a little thin\r\nand showed a slight fever, oliguria, and poor digestion. All these\r\nsymptoms now lapsed, and the man became apparently perfectly well.\r\n\r\nSuch states, according to Mallet, are relatively frequent in soldiers,\r\nboth in epilepsy, and in infectious deliria,--more than in the deliria\r\nof exhaustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAviator shot down: Organic mental symptoms.\r\n\r\n=Case 355.= (MACCURDY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA Canadian, 20, of normal makeup, in 1915 lost part of his left foot in\r\na railway accident, but, notwithstanding, was finally commissioned in\r\nthe Royal Flying Corps. He enjoyed the nine months of English training\r\ngreatly. In France he made several successful flights over the lines,\r\nbut was shot down and crashed to the ground within the British lines\r\nafter two weeks of service. He got black eyes and bruises and lost\r\nconsciousness for about four days, though a week later he was still\r\nhazy about recent events and was not quite sure in what hospital he\r\nlay. After another week he arrived in a London hospital.\r\n\r\nHere he would not answer questions, but stared at the examiner, finally\r\nshouting: “I want to get up.” He said he was in a certain suburb of\r\nToronto, which, however, he insisted was a part of London not far away.\r\nHe wanted a taxicab to go thither. He pondered, but seemed content\r\nwhen told that Rosedale was across the ocean. A superficial machine\r\ngun wound of the hip the patient said must be the mark of a hospital\r\nin France; it was a secret mark, meaning that he could return to the\r\nline and fight whenever he wanted to and that he could use the lavatory\r\nwhenever he wanted to. He sometimes uttered brief phrases after\r\nquestioning. Asked if he dreamed, he looked up cunningly and said,\r\n_e.g._, “I down the Boche. I am a live wire.”\r\n\r\nNext day it was clear that he had gained a good deal of information\r\nfrom the nurses, and the day after he had become oriented for time and\r\nable to recognize the physician, though still confused about hospital\r\nnames and his recent movements. The 7 from 100 test he did slowly\r\nand made several bad unrecognized mistakes. He was over-fatigueable,\r\ncomplained of foggy eyesight, showed haziness and redness and obscure\r\nmargins in the optic discs, with the remains of one hemorrhage, and\r\npresented nystagmus on looking to the extreme left. Two weeks later\r\nhe complained less of his memory and said that he was beginning to\r\nremember what had happened during the last day of his fighting; the\r\nchase by the German airplane and the maneuvers. He worried about being\r\nsent back to France by a medical board, which would not realize that he\r\nwas incompetent to fly again. The left pupil was slightly larger than\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nIn this case there were no neurotic symptoms and according to MacCurdy\r\nthe difficulties here are strictly those of organic type.\r\n\r\n_Re_ organic cases of traumatic psychosis, Lépine sums up the\r\nsubjective phenomena as follows: There is (_a_) a cephalea, often\r\na feeling of weight, varying at different times of the day; often\r\nfrontal; often subject to marked alteration on movement. There may be\r\n(_b_) a number of visual phenomena like those mentioned under Case\r\n355, part and parcel of a sort of absence, suggesting an epileptoid\r\neffect. Sometimes (_c_) there is vertigo, but this is rare. There are\r\nalso congestive attacks. The patients are unable to work, and have\r\nstrange head sensations when they attempt to work. The memory disorder\r\nis not as a rule markedly accentuated. This amnesia is usually a\r\ndisordered fixation of current events, but there is also a retrograde\r\namnesia. Insomnia and impulsiveness are also found, and more rarely\r\nis a depressed and melancholy state suggesting that which Case 355\r\nexhibited. Lépine has tried to define the traumatic psychoses (not\r\n_neuroses_) on the basis of phenomena found in trephined cases. He\r\nremarks upon the extreme analogy, not to say identity, between the late\r\nsequelae of trephining and the syndrome of _commotio cerebri_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaze with relapses; mutism--following shell fire and corpse work.\r\n\r\n=Case 356.= (MANN, June, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier lost his voice apparently from two factors: shell fire and\r\nthe emotional shock of helping to fill the big common graves. The man\r\ncould never tell for certain (retrograde amnesia) whether he went from\r\ncorpses to shell fire or from shell fire to corpses.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks of daze followed in which he hardly reacted to outward\r\nstimuli, but occasionally said “It smells!” “Leave me still!”\r\n\r\nHe recovered gradually from the daze. But merely hinting at his\r\nexperiences, especially the smells, sufficed to throw him into another\r\ndaze.\r\n\r\nThe loss of voice lasted for some time after he had wholly stopped\r\nlapsing into the dazed states.\r\n\r\nThere was some alcohol in the previous history of this case, which is\r\nthe only case among twenty-three Shell-shock cases reported by Mann\r\nwhich had a psychiatric disorder of any lasting nature due to shell\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n_Re_ mutism and the two factors of shell fire and emotion spoken of by\r\nMann, compare the views of Babinski to the effect that emotion alone is\r\nunable to cause such a hysterical manifestation as mutism.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the corpse work, see remarks under Case 342.\r\n\r\n\r\nMine explosion: Mental confusion. Amnesia effected through Y. M. C. A.\r\n\r\n=Case 357.= (WILTSHIRE, June, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA sapper, 21, was admitted to a base hospital semi-stuporous, unable\r\nto answer questions and mistaking the identity of persons about him.\r\nAt first he slept, but next day found he was in hospital. His mind was\r\n“all of a blur.” He did not remember coming to France; “It all seems a\r\nmist.” He felt he was ill and was afraid of becoming insane. There was\r\nno physical sign of disease except coarse tremor of hands.\r\n\r\nAt intervals over a period of about half an hour, helped by questions,\r\nhe was able to get out the following with much emotion:\r\n\r\n    “Joe, don’t go--Give me my rifle, Joe--Ten killed. Poor old\r\n    Taffy--Dreamed last night--Saw Harry Edmands with all his ribs\r\n    broken--when we had the explosion--5000 bombs or two and a half\r\n    tons of explosives blew up.--Joe--Clay said he would never\r\n    live three weeks,--Glasses blown in.--Taffy killed by shell\r\n    in stomach--S-- L-- All privates blown off him--Just after\r\n    leaving workshop.”\r\n\r\nBetween the above statements, the patient might go off into short\r\ntrance states, staring and pointing out of the tent.\r\n\r\nNext day he was found in a condition of cheerful emotion, saying that\r\nhe was ever so much better; an orderly had “saved him!” This orderly\r\nhad taken him to the Y. M. C. A. recreation tent, played the piano to\r\nhim, and made him play himself. His whole emotional state suddenly\r\nchanged over. He now had a good memory for everything previous to\r\nhis reaching France, and remembered simply that there had been an\r\nexplosion. He remembered two names that he had mentioned, but he could\r\nremember nothing about their fate in France. He did not know where they\r\nwere but he was not anxious about them.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Hallucinations; alternations of personality.\r\n\r\n=Case 358.= (GAUPP, March, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 29, a helper in a wholesale house, came to a hospital by\r\nhospital train, uninjured, directly from the field, having become\r\ncompletely deranged under shell fire. He arrived at the clinic January\r\n11, 1915, in deep emotion, anxiously excited, and looking tensely\r\nand suspiciously at the bystanders. He seemed to hear very badly and\r\nshouted his statements like a deaf person. Led to the sick section,\r\nhe shouted out of the window, “Frenchmen!”; then he went willingly to\r\nthe bath and was put to bed, unresisting. He lay in bed on his elbow,\r\nlistening in the direction of the window or the wall, answering loud\r\nquestions with a quick, yelling voice after a pause. He gave his\r\nname correctly. He seemed to think he was in the trenches and to see\r\nhallucinatory pictures of battle.\r\n\r\nIn the examining room he immediately sat down, back to the wall, taking\r\nthe chair at the desk and leaning it against the wall. Asked why he did\r\nso, he said with a horrified expression, “The shells, they are coming\r\nover! Whew! they are shooting all the time.” He ducked, imitating the\r\nhissing and whistling of the shells. Asked if he had been struck, he\r\nsaid, “There are two dead and one’s head is off.” He declined to be\r\ntold where he was, and when he was told that he was no longer in the\r\nenemy’s country, but in Württemberg, he said, “No, no; they don’t\r\ncome so far. No, the Frenchmen don’t come so far.” He was very easily\r\nfrightened and started at every touch as if wakened from a dream.\r\nSometimes his whole body would tremble with anxiety. He would not allow\r\nhis pulse to be taken, at first. He would suddenly shout, “That’s the\r\nKrupp now flying by. Now it has struck.” He cast his eyes along the\r\nceiling as if to follow the course of the shell. Asked what he was\r\ndoing, he said he was in the trench on the mountain.\r\n\r\nHe was able to tell about his family, his marriage in Berlin, and his\r\nchild, and he could tell time by the clock. Then he would suddenly\r\nshout: “The shells, they are shooting everything; they are shooting\r\nlike another earthquake.” Gaupp stepped up to him, in uniform, and\r\nasked if the patient knew him. He examined Gaupp suspiciously from top\r\nto toe, looked at the shoulder-straps, and then quickly cried loudly,\r\n“Physician.”\r\n\r\nAt another time he described the shell havoc with evidence of extreme\r\nanxiety. He would take food only when one broke off a piece and ate\r\nof it before him. He would not drink out of ordinary drinking-glasses\r\nbut only out of his field cup, examining it carefully. He denied he\r\nwas on patrol duty at Soupis. His comrade was merely asleep just\r\nnow. A civilian physician in his long coat was termed by the patient\r\n“a baker” after careful examination. There seemed to be no pause in\r\nthe man’s behavior, which looked absolutely genuine and dominated by\r\nstrong emotion. He had the look of a man in immediate danger of death,\r\nexerting himself to escape shell fire.\r\n\r\nThis dream-like disorder of consciousness with war delirium persisted\r\nfor a number of days. There was no marked motor excitement. He would\r\nremain for the most part quietly in bed, absorbed in his thoughts,\r\nwatching and listening, sometimes looking about in astonishment but not\r\ngetting his bearings. Gradually his emotions declined and he developed\r\na certain confidence in the nurse. She was able to convince him that he\r\nmight be in a hospital, although he objected that there were no wounded\r\nthere. (He was in a mental section where there were no bandaged men.)\r\nAll the while he was very hard of hearing and shouted loudly in speech.\r\nFor twelve days he could not be convinced that he was in Germany. The\r\nfact that the Sister was speaking German was met promptly by the fact\r\nthat in France the physicians and Sisters spoke German too.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary change came over him January 27 (sixteen days after\r\nadmission). He went into the garden, apparently deaf and shouting\r\nhis answers, accompanied by Sister Margarethe, whom he always called\r\n“Sister Anna” and whom he thought came from Lichterfelde. While\r\nwalking with the Sister, his condition suddenly disappeared. He began\r\nto hear; he spoke in a normal tone, in fact, rather low, and began to\r\naddress the Sister by her right name, Margarethe. He was astonished at\r\nthe snow in the garden, and asked the Sister whether she noticed that\r\nthe artillery had just stopped firing. Gradually getting his bearings,\r\nhe wondered whether he had been in the hospital since the day before.\r\nHe certainly was not ill, he thought.\r\n\r\nThis normal state lasted for a half hour. The patient then relapsed\r\ninto anxious semi-consciousness, becoming deaf again and shouting his\r\nwords. During the next few days and weeks he had frequent changes of\r\nstate like the above described. The changes to a normal state would\r\ntake place spontaneously in the absence of apparent occasion, but\r\nthe relapses into semi-consciousness took place when there was some\r\nouter irritation, especially some noise. Every fright would cause a\r\nrelapse. Once a small cannon fired at a great distance off caused such\r\na relapse; again, a sudden shouting at the patient.\r\n\r\nDuring the clear state there was a complete amnesia for the period of\r\nillness. He did not want to believe that he had been in the hospital\r\nfor weeks, declaring that he must have been in the trenches two days\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nGradually the semi-conscious states decreased in length; the deafness\r\nand loud speech returned with the semi-consciousness. With the return\r\nof orientation, the man looked entirely normal, speaking in a low voice\r\nsomewhat shyly. He was rather suspicious and could find his way about\r\nwith difficulty. His memory broke off with the last days of December,\r\n1914, at which time he was in the trenches under intense shell fire.\r\nHis wife had received no word from him since December 26. Even at the\r\nbeginning of February he grew anxiously tense when the word _shell_ was\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nFebruary 4, Gaupp presented him in clinic as entirely clear. He\r\nmentioned that his relapses to semi-consciousness occurred on the\r\noccasion of a loud noise or word spoken. His face was contorted at\r\nGaupp’s remark but there was no other change in him. The next day,\r\nhowever, he told the Sister that Gaupp had shouted out once to “get\r\nhim away.” He said he had then heard artillery fire for a moment,\r\nbut pulled himself together though he had almost gone off, and had a\r\nviolent headache afterward.\r\n\r\nThese states of alternating normality and semi-consciousness continued\r\nuntil about February 10. During a clear spell, the patient was quiet,\r\nreserved, taciturn, a little ill-tempered and seclusive, occasionally\r\nwriting his wife a rather empty letter. In the semi-conscious state\r\nhe was emotional and restless, seeking cover from the enemy. These\r\nstates stopped altogether about the middle of February. He then\r\nbecame somewhat more open, though he had no idea of the gravity of\r\nhis condition. He was angered by the window-bars, and offended by the\r\nopening of a letter to his wife, declaring that he would never write\r\na word again, as it was just like a prison. These outbursts passed\r\nquickly by. He wanted to go home and believed he would soon be able to\r\ngo to his comrades in the field.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the report, Gaupp felt that he could not be discharged\r\nfor a number of weeks. He was pallid, gave the impression of being\r\nexhausted mentally, complained of restlessness and internal irritation.\r\nHis memory gap covered at the end of March a period of about five\r\nweeks: from the end of December, 1914, to the beginning of February,\r\n1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrostbite; thrown into water by horse; horse shot under its rider who\r\nbecomes: A HORSE IN THE UNCONSCIOUS.\r\n\r\n=Case 359.= (EDER, March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private in the Royal Engineers, 25, went through Gallipoli without\r\ninjury and without fears. He was sent to the hospital in Malta,\r\nDecember 18. When observed by Eder, February 7, the frostbitten finger\r\nof the right hand was well although there was some loss of grip. He\r\nwas suffering from insomnia, terrifying dreams, shaky hands. It seems\r\nthat December 6, a horse started and he was thrown into the water from\r\na bridge. The next day his horse was shot under him. A few days later,\r\na finger was frostbitten. Then his hands began to tremble and the\r\ninsomnia set in, with severe headaches.\r\n\r\nThis patient was a jovial, thickset, farmer’s son, with a diffuse\r\nenlargement of the thyroid gland, a high blood pressure, lymphocytosis,\r\na fine tremor of the hands, irregular and rapid pulse, and anginal\r\nattacks. Extremities were cold and blue; the palms perspired markedly;\r\nthere was hypersensitiveness to sound; there were occasional attacks of\r\ndizziness, with a feeling of suffocation; there was frequent desire to\r\nmicturate.\r\n\r\nThe patient’s dream was always the same: He saw a Frenchman digging\r\na knife into his horse, getting off a cart to do this somewhere in\r\nSerbia. Occasionally he had this dream in the form of a vision in the\r\ndaytime. It seems that he had actually seen a French soldier plunge a\r\nknife into a mule to make it go. He had been busy with horses since\r\nchildhood: as stableboy and groom. He thought that the sufferings of\r\nthe mules in Gallipoli were worse than those of human beings. According\r\nto Eder, this farmer’s son was the horse of his dreams; instinctive\r\nfear had to emerge; he was pitying himself. According to Eder, “That\r\nthe person should become a horse in the unconscious would not startle\r\none who has dipped into the totems and taboos of the lower races.”\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; gassing; fatigue: Anesthesias.\r\n\r\n=Case 360.= (MYERS, March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA stretcher-bearer, 44, eleven years in the service and two months on\r\nFrench service, was seen by Lt. Col. Myers eight days after reporting\r\nsick and admission to a base hospital.\r\n\r\nWhile he was under cover in a cellar, three days before reporting sick,\r\na shell had jammed the door and the fumes came in. Later in the day,\r\nin another cellar, he had been blown off his seat by a shell and six\r\nother men had been laid out. The shelling continued that day and two\r\nfollowing days. He had worked on the wounded without any rest.\r\n\r\nOn lying down he found his left arm numb and cold. The numbness then\r\nspread to the legs, especially to the left leg. There was continual\r\ntingling in terminal joints of fingers of left hand; hypalgesia over\r\nboth forearms and hands, especially on left side; total analgesia over\r\nleft dorsum.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, the patient could feel articles and reported that the\r\nnumbness occurred only in the early morning and was followed by a\r\ntingling as the numbness passed off. On the same day, the hands and\r\nforearms showed a total loss of sensibility to pain, except for a small\r\narea on the flexor surface below the elbow joint.\r\n\r\n_Re_ spread of anesthesia and alternation of sensory symptoms in\r\nthis case. Babinski, of course, believes, that the majority of these\r\nconditions are the product of medical suggestion, but Babinski meets\r\nany critique by pointing out that any other sort of suggestion may\r\nproduce such results. The heterosuggestion need not be medical.\r\nThus, the sight of a comrade with paralysis or anesthesia, organic\r\nor hysterical, may suggest such to the soldier. Léri remarks that\r\nthese may also be produced by autosuggestion alone. “From a tired\r\nfeeling in a limb to a loss of power in it, there is but a small\r\nstep. Another step leads to paralysis and anesthesia. The neuropathic\r\ntemperament takes these small steps in perfectly good faith.” Léri\r\nhas found no case in which he could exclude the influence of auto- or\r\nheterosuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; burial; somnambulistic state: Amnesia. Recovery of memory\r\nin hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 361.= (MYERS, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA healthy-looking man, with flushed face and large dark eyes with\r\nwide pupils, complained of pains in abdomen, back, and limbs, chiefly\r\nin knees and ankles, and of visual impairment. This corporal said\r\nthat his sight had been very indistinct since he was buried, and that\r\nif he looked at an electric light, he could see nothing for five\r\nminutes afterwards. He was admitted to the Duchess of Westminster’s\r\nWar Hospital at Touquet, December 11, 1914, having been buried for 48\r\nhours, December 8, when a shell blew in the trench where he lay. He\r\nsaid he could remember nothing until he found himself in a dressing\r\nstation, lying on straw, in a barn. He was at that time unable to see\r\nand fell over something when he tried to walk.\r\n\r\nHe had gone out August 13, and had been in the last two days at Mons\r\nand then at La Bassée. He had slept badly and had taken a good deal of\r\nwhiskey. He had led a fast life and had had domestic worries recently.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that his vision had improved since the day of the\r\nexplosion; though he could read for a short time only when things\r\nbecame blurred, and only with the type close to the eyes. Bowels had\r\nnot opened for five days. Vision in right eye was 5/60; left eye, 2/60.\r\n\r\nTested for smell, he failed to smell peppermint, ether, iodin tincture,\r\nand carbolic acid 1-40. Sugar was tasted only after tongue movements\r\nwere permitted, as was also a strong solution of salt. Acid tasted\r\nsalty like alum. The patient complained that he did not sleep, though\r\nin point of fact he slept well.\r\n\r\nThe patient was treated by suggestion, both in hypnosis and without,\r\nwhen he was transferred on the 31st of December, to the London\r\nTemperance Hospital, whence he was discharged. The treatment by\r\nsuggestion occurred daily. At the second trial and thereafter,\r\nlight hypnosis was easily induced, but the deeper stages, with\r\nhallucinations, anesthesia, and post-hypnotic anesthesia, could not be\r\nreached. The lighter stages brought about sleep, a gradual restoration\r\nof memory, and later an improvement in visual and olfactory acuity; in\r\nnear vision, in visual fields, and in color sensibility.\r\n\r\nThe stages in the restoration of memory are as follows: December 22,\r\nhe was able to describe how he was buried, how Sergeant L. dug him\r\nout, how men of another regiment than his own took him to a dressing\r\nstation, whence he was packed off by the M. O. to the dressing station\r\nof his own regiment. Capt. S. had spoken to him and given him a drink.\r\nPost-hypnotic suggestion caused him to remember this latter fact after\r\nhe had come out from hypnosis.\r\n\r\nDecember 23, even before hypnosis, he could remember a big hospital\r\nwith a stove in the center of a big square room, and gave a fragmentary\r\naccount of struggling in the trench after being buried, and of going to\r\nsleep and enjoying himself at home, when somebody started messing him\r\nabout. In hypnosis, he gave further details of his dreams after falling\r\nasleep in the buried state.\r\n\r\nDecember 26, further details were remembered before hypnosis, such\r\nas a ride in the motor ambulance, offers of tea, cocoa, sweets, and\r\ncigarettes, a bad headache, and the like.\r\n\r\nDecember 27, in hypnosis, he was able to describe with apparent\r\naccuracy the position of the trenches and their appearance. He said:\r\n\r\n    “The explosion lifted us up and dropped us again. It seemed as\r\n    if the ground underneath had been taken away. I was lying on\r\n    my right side, resting on my right hand, when the shell came.\r\n    I got my right hand loose but my wrist was fixed behind a\r\n    piece of fallen timber. At last I dropped off to sleep and had\r\n    funny dreams of things at home. One thing in particular I have\r\n    thought of many times since, I have not been able to make out\r\n    why I should dream of the young lady playing the piano. I don’t\r\n    know her name and I don’t think I have seen her above twice.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Myers, it is questionable how far the patient’s memory\r\ncan be trusted; and there is considerable doubt whether the man had\r\nremained in the trench for more than an hour after the shell had burst.\r\nA comrade said that the doctors at the barn thought the man off his\r\nhead. Another soldier, familiar with the positions of the regiments in\r\nquestion, gave information suggesting that the patient had wandered in\r\na somnambulistic state from the trench, past his own dressing station\r\nto that of another regiment.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Shell-shock and burial cases, compare remarks of Grasset and of\r\nFoucault concerning the feeling as if dead on the part of certain\r\nburied persons. Somnambulism is a natural sequel to such feelings. For\r\nsomnambulism, compare cases of Milian (364, 365, and 366).\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; minor injuries: Somnambulistic “carrying on”;\r\nfatigueability, physical and mental.\r\n\r\n=Case 362.= (DONATH, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant of infantry, 31, threw himself down on the earth September\r\n9, 1914, as a shell was passing over him. The shell exploded and\r\nseriously injured a soldier one meter away. The lieutenant got up and\r\nran for cover about twenty meters distant. Only six and a half hours\r\nlater did he perceive that there was a small skin lesion between his\r\nthumb and index finger, caused by a shell fragment, as well as a\r\nsuperficial burn on his right temple. Neither wound bled or had to be\r\ndressed. He carried on, aware that they were marching toward the River\r\nD.; but only two or three days later did he find they had already\r\nmarched to the other side of K., had rested there and spent the night\r\nin various places in between. During this whole period the lieutenant\r\nled his battalion and held a piece of woods without anyone’s noticing\r\nanything striking about him. These dazed states were twice repeated,\r\nfor periods of ten and twenty-four hours respectively, and finally he\r\nwas brought behind the firing lines unconscious.\r\n\r\nThe physician found him to be in a state of exhaustion, pulse 108, and\r\nhad him brought to the nearest station. There Donath found increased\r\ntendon reflexes, some dermatographia and increased fatigueability of\r\nmind and body. He was especially fatigued by walking, though he had\r\nalways been a good mountain climber. He was now unable to concentrate\r\non reading, writing or calculating, though he had been accustomed to\r\ndictate letters and calculations in his official work in peace times.\r\nHe had seizures of crying and trembling on September 10 and October 27,\r\nboth quieted by bromides. There was diminution of sexual power.\r\n\r\nRest, lukewarm baths, cold compresses to the head, and psychotherapy\r\nimproved his status rapidly.\r\n\r\nThis patient had never been epileptic or hysterical, subject to dazed\r\nstates of any sort, was weak, delicate and anemic (three sisters\r\nleukemic), but had before the war been well.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotion of captain who saw men burned by bomb: Stupor “as if dead”;\r\nawakening “as if a German prisoner.” Recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 363.= (RÉGIS, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA captain, one day seeing some of his men hit by incendiary bombs,\r\nfelt the deepest kind of emotion. He threw his coat over one of his\r\nmen and succeeded in smothering the fire. Of a sudden, he completely\r\nlost consciousness, only regaining contact with the outer world two\r\ndays later, in the sanitary train. He did not know where he was, but\r\nthought himself a prisoner surrounded by Germans. The disorder of\r\nconsciousness lasted three days, and the memory of what happened during\r\nthose days never returned. In fact, the captain declared that he felt\r\nas if he had been dead during that time. His dreamlike state lasted for\r\nsome time, and for several weeks he did not sleep without disturbing\r\nnightmares. It was always the same night attack, with the burned men\r\nand the anguish of feeling that his men were not about him and that\r\nhe was alone in the skirmish. He later recovered entirely and made\r\npreparations to start for the front.\r\n\r\n_Re_ feelings “as if dead,” see remarks of Régis under Case 293.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotions over battle scenes: Spontaneous hypnosis or SOMNAMBULISM\r\nlasting twenty-four days.\r\n\r\n=Case 364.= (MILIAN, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nUpon recovery from a state of apparent hypnosis described below, the\r\nvictim wrote, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n    “After marching two days we reached a Breton village near\r\n    Virtou. Next day we were in a battle that lasted from seven in\r\n    the morning to eight in the evening. I was somewhat troubled by\r\n    the first balls and bullets that whistled by, but felt I had to\r\n    get used to them and we marched on, under our brave captain’s\r\n    orders. Then we really got under fire. It was sad to see my\r\n    comrades falling under the murderous bullets, and the captain\r\n    was soon mortally wounded; but we had reinforcements and went\r\n    on and chased the enemy from his positions. During the battle\r\n    I kept thinking of my old mother and father and I felt that\r\n    I should die without seeing them again. Little things about\r\n    the family came to my mind. I saw my father’s roof, and his\r\n    favorite garden seat, and I saw my mother weeping over her only\r\n    son, her only ambition in old age. The return from the battle\r\n    was very sad for me. Night began to fall on the frightful\r\n    field. I saw on the bare earth the bodies of poor comrades\r\n    whose joys and sorrows I had shared. There they were, cut down\r\n    in all the strength of youth, leaving their parents in trouble,\r\n    their widows in despair, and their poor orphans. I wanted to\r\n    carry them off and I could not. We had to march over their\r\n    glorious remains. I was able to give a word of encouragement\r\n    to one of my comrades who now probably is no more. We then\r\n    retired. Although I was very weary, I was unable to get any\r\n    rest. My mind was occupied with the frightful things I had\r\n    seen. I thought of the comrades over there and that no one\r\n    could help them. I remember I drank coffee the next morning and\r\n    talked with my relative. Then that is all. From that time I do\r\n    not know what happened.”\r\n\r\nThe writer was an infantryman, 20, who had been employed in civil life\r\nin the Crédit Lyonnais, and was brought August 24, 1914, to the Saint\r\nNicolas Hospital in a state of hypnosis.\r\n\r\nOnce placed in the standing position he kept balancing back and forth,\r\nwith head motionless, eyes fixed and directed to the left side. He\r\ndid not speak in reply to a request for his name or facts about his\r\nlife, but as soon as the battle was talked of he began an expressive\r\npantomime, speaking in a very low voice a few words interrupted by\r\nsighs. “What were you doing in the fight?” He extended his arms,\r\ndescribed a half circle with his hand, as if to show the extent of the\r\nfield, thrust his hands forward with a finger outstretched, saying,\r\n“Zi, zi,” as if to indicate whistling bullets; plunged forward with\r\nhands in front of his chest, as if holding a gun in charge bayonet\r\nposition, saying “Prussians, Prussians,” and threw himself down in a\r\nkneeling posture, saying, “Trenches, trenches.” “Do you remember the\r\nbattle?” “Belgium, Belgium. Germans pushed back,” making a sign as if\r\nchasing them. “Captain dead. Two hundred men dead.” With a suitable\r\ngesture he sighed, and tears ran down his face.\r\n\r\nAugust 28 the mutism was still almost complete, but he could say his\r\nname and lay stretched out on the bed.\r\n\r\nSeptember 4 the hypnosis was less, but the delirious state was more\r\nactive. He got up in the night and tried to escape to help the wounded.\r\nIn the daytime, if he saw a man lying down resting he went to him and\r\nunbuttoned his coat to see whether he was wounded. Upon seeing the\r\nphysician he would cry, “Major! Wounded! wounded!” and then pull the\r\nphysician by his coat. He could hardly be stopped from these maneuvers.\r\nHe had to be fed like a child, but went alone to stool.\r\n\r\nHe began to be employed about the hospital a little September 14,\r\nin sweeping the room and in guarding another patient in complete\r\nsomnambulism, over whom he watched as over a child, leading him by the\r\nhand and keeping him from bumping into objects.\r\n\r\nSeptember 16 he awoke suddenly. Some one had talked to him about his\r\nown village and his relatives. He was astonished to find himself\r\nin a hospital. He wrote out, on request, the above account of his\r\nrecollections. The man was 177 cm. tall, well proportioned; showed a\r\nslight facial asymmetry and a few other facial features of a dystrophic\r\nnature, such as an adenoid appearance. There was no stigma of hysteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nPutative loss of brother nearby in battle: Spontaneous hypnosis or\r\nsomnambulism; mutism, except “Mamma, Mamma.” Sudden awakening after\r\ntwenty-seven days.\r\n\r\n=Case 365.= (MILIAN, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man, 22, was brought to the Saint Nicolas Hospital in a sort of\r\ncoma August 24, 1914. He lay on the bed, eyes closed as if asleep,\r\ninsensible to excitation, irresponsive. Flies crawled upon him with\r\nimpunity. He did not wink. The arms raised fell back inert. The corneal\r\nreflex was absent on the left side, diminished on the right. The\r\nknee-jerks and the skin reflexes were normal.\r\n\r\nNext day he had to be fed like a child and looked after. Lifted from\r\nbed, once on the ground he stood up with flexed legs, as if to crouch.\r\nIt seemed as if he was about to fall, but he did not.\r\n\r\nThe next day he was in the same immobile state. Upon removal from bed\r\nhe again made as if to fall, but got his balance. He kept his legs\r\nflexed, his head lowered in a fixed posture, with his eyes on the\r\nground. He would walk quickly without falling, if taken by the hand,\r\nfeet dragging, and even holding back with a certain amount of force.\r\nHis walk suggested that of a somnambulist. He was left in a standing\r\nposture by his bed throughout the medical visit. After a few minutes\r\nhe began to flex his legs progressively and slowly. The attendant\r\ncried out, “He is going to fall.” Instead of falling, he sat down upon\r\nthe floor near the bed. He was in the same immobile, somnolent state\r\nSeptember 1, eyes half open, hidden under long lashes. Flies walked\r\nover his eyes and lids, but he did not wink. He would rise only when\r\npushed and walk only when pulled, but had begun to eat a little better.\r\nTo all questions he replied, from between his teeth, “Mamma. Mamma.”\r\n\r\nThe next day there was a bit more spontaneity in his walking.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture showed a slight hypertension. There were traces of\r\nalbumin and very few lymphocytes.\r\n\r\nSeptember 6, he was able to eat soup alone, but kept the same immobile\r\nposture, with eyes fixed on the ground, eyelids not winking, in a\r\nposture suggesting Parkinson’s disease, but without rigidity. He still\r\nreplied only, “Mamma. Mamma.”\r\n\r\nSeptember 19 the patient suddenly waked up completely. Douches and\r\nexternal irritations had not served to wake him up, but a soldier told\r\nhim upon this day that his brother was not dead, as he believed, but\r\nwas alive and he then began to speak, opened his eyes, and began to\r\ntalk. He told how he had been by the side of his brother in battle.\r\nGermans had taken them in the flank and opened machine guns upon them.\r\nTwo men had fallen by his side, and, catching at his garments, kept\r\nhim from retiring when the order was given. He got loose, looked for\r\nhis brother among the corpses, could not find him, thought him dead,\r\nand from that point forward had been without memory. He shortly became\r\nperfectly normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; slight trauma; windage felt; fall; loss of consciousness;\r\nwandering, conscious, over night; shrapnel burst: Spontaneous hypnosis\r\nor somnambulism, lasting four days. Return to the corps.\r\n\r\n=Case 366.= (MILIAN, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 20, boxer by profession, was brought with other\r\nwounded, in the night, to Saint Nicolas Hospital and was seen next\r\nmorning, August 24, in bed, lying motionless on his back, eyes open,\r\nfixed, eyelids not winking. No reply was got to questions. The arm\r\nlifted fell back upon the bed, although slowly and not heavily as in\r\napoplexy. There was no catalepsy. The patient was taken from his bed\r\nand put upright. In this position he remained immobile, hands at side,\r\nhead bent forward, eyes fixed on the ground. The eyelids did not move\r\nupon approach of the finger or a lighted candle, unless there was a\r\nfine beginning of movement. If he was pushed, he made two or three\r\nsteps forward, with eyes fixed on the ground and head bent forward. The\r\nonly spontaneous movement was carrying the left hand back to the side\r\nas if to take the bayonet. He got into bed alone.\r\n\r\nNext day the patient could walk better and began to talk, but preserved\r\nthe same absorbed attitude. He told, in monotonous voice, of the shells\r\nthat his squad had received and of the dead that he saw about him.\r\nAugust 27 he woke up and was unable to tell how he had come to the\r\nhospital. He told how the regiment had been bombarded for a time and\r\nhow a shell burst near him; how he got a splinter in the buttock (of\r\nwhich the contusion was still visible); and how he had been thrown down\r\nby the windage of the shell. His sack had been torn from his shoulders.\r\nHe had lost consciousness, he thought, for a short time, anyhow he\r\ncould not find his regiment. He passed the night near Longuyon and\r\nnext day looked for his regiment again. Shrapnel burst near him, and\r\nfrom that time forward he had lost memory. August 27, at his express\r\nrequest, he started back for his corps. There was no stigma of\r\ndegeneration or hysteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurial; struck in head by beam; overcome by gas: Tremors, convulsive\r\nmovements, confusion, flight toward enemy.\r\n\r\n=Case 367.= (CONSIGLIO, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian private, 28, of meager build (infantile eclampsia; brother\r\nepileptic) was buried by a shell explosion and overcome by gas. After a\r\nmonth’s leave he went back to the trenches.\r\n\r\nBut now, whenever a shell burst, he fell into irresistible terror and\r\nmade convulsive movements which he forgot afterwards. He could not\r\nsleep. The mere memory of the scene would throw him into terror. He\r\nwas tremulous, developed asymmetrical innervation of his face, was\r\ngenerally hypesthetic and mentally blocked.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of convulsive tremors he fled towards the enemy. He was\r\nstopped and brought back, and remained for two days confused and\r\nhallucinated.\r\n\r\nIn the original accident he had been struck in the head by a beam.\r\n\r\n_Re_ this Italian’s flight toward the enemy, see various cases of\r\nfugue. Clinically and medico-legally, Roussy and Lhermitte remark that\r\nthese confusional escapades are of great interest, and that many cases\r\nare encountered near the front line, put under trial by court-martial,\r\nand handed over to specialists. The dream is being lived through. Such\r\na case as this of Consiglio recalls the hystero-emotional psychoses\r\nof Claude, Dide, and Lejonne. The relation of oniric delirium to\r\nmental confusion is still a matter of polemic. According to Régis,\r\nhowever, the common oniric delirium of toxic or infectious origin\r\nis nothing more than a sort of somnambulism. The retrograde amnesia\r\nwhich follows toxic delirium is the same in principle as that which\r\nfollows hysterical delirium. Régis pointed out that suggestive hypnosis\r\ncould bring back the memories in both types of disease, as well as\r\nfrom the toxic delirium as from the hysterical somnambulism. However,\r\nthe differential diagnosis between onirism and hysteria is not easy.\r\nAlcoholism and actual brain trauma need to be excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; windage; unconsciousness: Carried on with fugue\r\ntendencies. Variety of hysterical symptoms. Fit for garrison duty four\r\nmonths from explosion.\r\n\r\n=Case 368.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA non-commissioned officer, 22, entered service at 20, went into the\r\nartillery and had been advanced repeatedly. There was no heredity; the\r\nman had been a moderately good scholar. It appears that he had had at\r\n17 a febrile angina with delirium.\r\n\r\nSeptember 25, 1914, a big shell load for a cannon was exploded by\r\nthe enemy. All the men about the cannon were thrown to the ground by\r\nair pressure, and the officer became unconscious. On awaking, he had\r\nheadache, dizziness, and vomiting. There were many corpses lying about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe resumed work at once, but in the evening his headache and dizziness\r\nincreased and there was “a feeling inside as if he had to run away.”\r\nThis feeling appeared to come from the heart; it was an oppressive\r\nfeeling, running to the head. On the next day he did gun duty,\r\nnoticing, however, that every shot he fired caused him a sharp pain.\r\nHe was relieved from work at 11 A.M., and was declared ill by the\r\nphysician. His comrades told him that he had often been noticed trying\r\nto run away, but about this he himself declared he knew nothing.\r\n\r\nHe was received at the Jena Hospital, October 9, 1914, a very strongly\r\nbuilt and well-nourished man. Neurologically, he showed a marked\r\ndermatographia; knee-jerks were obtainable only on reinforcement;\r\nAchilles jerks somewhat more marked; there was a weakly positive\r\nOppenheim reflex. The abdominal reflex on the left side was greater\r\nthan that on the right; and this was also true of the cremaster reflex.\r\nPercussion of the head was extremely painful; and there were painful\r\npoints on pressure of the spine and head.\r\n\r\nTouch was poor on the entire left side of the body; but there was no\r\ndiminution of sensibility to pain. There was a fine static tremor\r\nof the hands. The strength of both hands appeared to be decreased\r\n(dynamometer). Gait was unsteady and stiff; Romberg sign was positive;\r\nthe patient fell over backward. Hearing was greatly diminished,\r\nordinary speech being heard only close to the ear.\r\n\r\nToward evening of the second day after admission, there was a marked\r\nattack of dizziness while the patient was lying on his back in bed.\r\nDuring this attack the face was very red. It lasted two or three\r\nminutes. Hearing was remarkably improved on the left side for some\r\ntime after the attack. The ear clinic examination, October 19, showed\r\nmuch disturbance of hearing on the right side (direct injury of the\r\nvestibular apparatus in both ears).\r\n\r\nHeadaches continued, radiating from the orbit to the top of the head,\r\nand sensitiveness to pressure at the exit point of the upper branch of\r\nthe right trigeminal. The whole of the forehead was somewhat red and\r\nswollen (neuralgia of the frontalis). The patient wore dark goggles on\r\naccount of his marked photophobia.\r\n\r\nImprovement was gradual; there was a transient slight swelling and\r\na venous hyperemia of the nasal mucosa, which was treated in the\r\nnose clinic. The impairment of hearing was quite gone in two months’\r\ntime, though buzzing was now and then heard in the right ear. The\r\nsupersensitiveness in the right upper trigeminal region vanished also.\r\nThe patient was discharged January 21, 1915, fit for garrison duty.\r\nLater he went into the field again.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurial: Dissociation of personality.\r\n\r\n=Case 369.= (FEILING, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nThe following are some stories told by a “lost personality” under\r\nhypnosis.\r\n\r\nThe patient, aged 24, was a bandsman in the Second Battalion Wiltshire\r\nRegiment, who sometime near the end of October 1914, was buried in a\r\ntrench near Ypres. This is his account:\r\n\r\n“I was dug out at night and taken to a dressing station; it was cold\r\nand dark. Then I went on to a hospital at Ypres; it was really a\r\nconvent, and there were a lot of nuns about, dressed in dark robes with\r\nwhite hats; some of them spoke English. I stopped there for a night and\r\na day. There were a lot of wounded there. Then I was sent on by train;\r\nI lay down all the way on a seat in the carriage; we took the whole day\r\nto get to ----, and kept on stopping at stations. I was at ---- about\r\nten days; I don’t know what hospital it was, but there were English\r\ndoctors and nurses. It was near the harbor. We came over to England in\r\na hospital ship, the _Arethusa_; I went straight on to Manchester by\r\ntrain. The hospital there was really a school turned into a hospital.”\r\n\r\nHere is a brief account of a scrap with some Uhlans.\r\n\r\nQ. Did you see any Uhlans? Yes.\r\n\r\nQ. What are they like? They’ve got no guts. One time 30 of them were\r\nagainst 8 of us infantry, and they “done a bunk.” Their horses were not\r\nbad. They wore helmets with a double eagle on the front.\r\n\r\nHe was asked to describe the country round the trenches and to give\r\nsome account of the fighting there:\r\n\r\n“It’s agricultural land, ploughed fields. There were two farms in front\r\nof us. One day we saw an old cow between our trenches and the Germans,\r\nand we all had pot shots at it. Once the Germans rushed our trenches;\r\nwe killed hundreds, bayoneted them mostly, and hit them over the heads\r\nwith the butts of our rifles. It was hellish. The British were all\r\nshouting. I saw a German officer behind with a sword and a revolver.\r\nI saw a lot of French soldiers, too; they wore long coats with the\r\ncorners turned back; some had blue and some had red trousers. The\r\nFrench dragoons are like Life Guards, with big steel breastplates and\r\nbrass helmets with a long plume; they carried swords and rifles and a\r\nfew had lances.”\r\n\r\nHe was asked to mention some of his impressions in Belgium and what he\r\nthought of the manners and customs of the French and Belgians.\r\n\r\n“We cut off all our buttons and gave them to the French girls. The\r\nFrench cigarettes are muck; you buy them in little blue packets; the\r\ntobacco is rather dark and strong. When we bivouacked on the march at\r\nnight we were not allowed any lights, but you could smoke by digging a\r\nhole in the ground with your bayonet and smoking into that.”\r\n\r\nThe following are some of his remarks about his stay at Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n“Gibraltar’s like a great big rock; the steep side looks toward Spain.\r\nI was in barracks there, and used to spend a lot of time in the\r\nband-room practicing. Sometimes we bathed in the sea. I went to Spain\r\ntwo or three times and saw some bull-fights; they were very exciting,\r\nbut rather too cruel for my taste. They used to kill six or seven bulls\r\na day. The horses got fearfully cut about.”\r\n\r\nThis bandsman showed what Feiling calls dissociation of personality.\r\nThere was an amnesia of such degree that all conscious memories of the\r\npatient’s life, as well as all memory of letters, objects, and life in\r\ngeneral, were suppressed. The patient was brought, after the burial\r\nabove noted, to the hospital for epilepsy and paralysis at Maida Vale,\r\nJanuary 21, 1915. After his experience, he had been transferred to the\r\nSecond Western General Hospital, Manchester, where he spoke sensibly,\r\nunderstood and was able to remember things since the burial. His mind\r\nwas a complete blank for all previous experience. He was unable to\r\nrecognize his own father or relatives. He was slightly deaf for a time\r\nbut this defect disappeared.\r\n\r\nAt Maida Vale he showed a nervous twitching of eyelids and facial\r\nmuscles; otherwise he was neurologically and physically normal,\r\ndreamless, without complaints, and straightforward about all\r\nexperiences since coming to himself in the hospital at Manchester. He\r\ntook his parents on trust. “I don’t know if I ever went to school.” “A\r\nbayonet is like a knife; you see soldiers with them on their rifles. I\r\nhave never seen a bullet.” His memory for recent events was also not\r\ngood. He once recognized a single tune played at a concert.\r\n\r\nSuspected of malingering, he was tried out in various ways. He was told\r\nthat an elephant was a little furry animal and shown a little 6 inch\r\ntoy sample. On going to the zoo he was greatly astonished at seeing a\r\nreal elephant. He did not know what the war was about and he had no\r\ninterest therein.\r\n\r\nMarch 10 he was hypnotized and proved an easy subject. Powerful\r\nsuggestions that lost memories would return were unavailing. The next\r\nday, during hypnosis, it was found that his previous experience could\r\nbe readily tapped, and a history of his family, schooling, running\r\naway, and eventual enlistment was told. He had been at Gibraltar when\r\nwar broke out. He was at the first battle at Ypres, and was for ten\r\ndays in severe trench fighting, and was finally buried in the mud and\r\ndébris of a trench blown in by a high explosive shell. He had been\r\nburied for about 12 hours, was dug out at night, and (according to his\r\nfather) remained unconscious 24 hours, and deaf and dumb three days. He\r\nwas transferred to another hospital and then to Manchester, where he\r\ncame to himself.\r\n\r\nOnly during the first few sittings did the patient lie with eyes\r\nclosed. Later, during hypnosis, he behaved exactly like a normal\r\nperson. The fact came to light that when hypnotized the patient\r\nreturned to the personality that possessed him just before awakening\r\nin Manchester, and accordingly during hypnosis, he had to become\r\nacquainted again with his hypnotizer. Maida Vale astonished him, as it\r\nshould have been Manchester. Thus there were two personalities: No. 1:\r\nThe personality since the date of the Manchester awakening; No. 2: The\r\npersonality containing all the memories of the past life as well as the\r\nmore recent Flanders memories. In State No. 1, the manner was jaunty\r\nand cocksure. In State No. 2, the man was more modest and less loud.\r\nMoreover, though in State No. 1 he spoke with a Lancashire accent,\r\nin State No. 2 his speech was in the West Country dialect--a strange\r\nobservation, confirmed by several observers. He was asked to write down\r\nthe answers to questions, and on awakening from hypnosis was shown the\r\nthings written; whereupon he laughed and said, “Why, that’s not my\r\nwriting.” On writing out the same sentences again, various minor points\r\nof difference were apparent. Hypnotized in the presence of his father,\r\nin whom in State No. 1 he took no great interest, he showed every sign\r\nof joy, causing his father to think that in State No. 2, his son had\r\n“come all right again.” In State No. 2 he could play a euphonium better\r\nthan in State No. 1; but after practicing in State No. 1 he rapidly\r\nbecame as expert as in the hypnotic state.\r\n\r\nIf the patient were left for some time before being awaked by a\r\npreviously-arranged method of counting three, he would experience\r\ndisturbed dreams, with clenched hands, snarling lips, and muttered\r\nphrases, “Give it them,” etc.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five hypnotic sittings were given but no improvement took place\r\nand the patient was discharged May 5. May 25 there had been no further\r\nchange and he remained in State No. 1, in which state he was invalided\r\nfrom the service by a medical board, May 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nEar complications and hysteria.\r\n\r\n=Case 370.= (BUSCAINO AND COPPOLA, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 22 (father and mother quite normal; patient showed\r\nslight convulsions, attributed to worms, from which he actually\r\nsuffered; was malarial from 9 to 15; had otitis media and lost hearing\r\ncompletely at 11; had suffered from 9 onwards with joint pains; as an\r\nadult had no convulsions), was called to arms August, 1914, and sent\r\nto the front May 2, 1915. About the end of August, in a water-filled\r\ntrench by Monte San Michele, he was covered with mud from a shell\r\nexplosion, lost consciousness, and in some way got back to the second\r\nline. He was told that blood had flowed from the right ear, and on\r\nrecovery he found himself unable to hear with that ear, although it was\r\nthe left in which he had had otitis. There were continual noises in\r\nthe ear. He was, however, sent back to the front line. By mistake, one\r\nday, he got with companions in the midst of the enemy’s barbed wire,\r\nsaw sparks from the guns, heard no shots, saw comrades fall, and threw\r\nhimself instinctively into the wire network. Leaving the food kettles,\r\nhe finally got back to the trenches. He was sent to the hospital at\r\nLegnano for his ear pains, and was treated by leeches, which he could\r\nnot feel. He began to hear a little more. Flies walked on the left\r\ncheek without being felt. This anesthesia had begun a few days after\r\nthe shell explosion. He was transferred to a military hospital at\r\nFlorence.\r\n\r\nOne day he wedged a toothpick in cotton into his left ear and was\r\ncharged with simulation, though he had been absolutely deaf in his left\r\near since childhood. From the moment the military surgeon told him he\r\nwould be denounced for simulation, he lost his memory. Reports indicate\r\nthat he had headache and delirious dreams (October 30), and suddenly he\r\nbecame furious (October 31), about three hours later going into severe\r\ncollapse, for which camphor injections were given.\r\n\r\nNovember 1 he had battle dreams and lumbar puncture had to be given\r\nup as he was in the midst of an attack. A hypodermic injection was\r\ninterpreted by the patient as a wound, and he cried as if he were\r\nbeing abandoned on the battle-field. At one point he woke up from\r\nhis hallucination and asked where he was and shortly relapsed into\r\nstupor. November 2, the patient was slightly bewildered and felt pains\r\nwhere the lumbar puncture needle had been tried the previous day.\r\nNovember 5, he was disoriented, thinking himself still at Legnano.\r\nThe pupils were throughout dilated. November 6, confused and dreamy;\r\nNovember 7, he soiled his bed, was somewhat disoriented, immediately\r\ncorrected himself; oculo-cardiac reflex 64 full compression, 62 during\r\ncompression. November 11, headache; November 12, a slight bewilderment\r\nreappeared; November 13, remembered for the first time having been\r\nstunned by shell explosion, and this day got up and wrote home.\r\nNovember 14, complained of pains in muscles and weariness. Pupils still\r\ndilated. November 16, pulse 86; a gradual increase from 50 to 60 during\r\nprevious days. November 17, patient had begun to remember facts that\r\npreceded the dream syndrome. November 18, pulse standing 88; November\r\n20, pulse standing 120. This day cried when he remembered having been\r\nsuspected of simulation. November 22 and 23, aches in joints and\r\nintense otalgia; pulse 86. November 24, diarrhea; deafness somewhat\r\ndiminished; 26, diarrhea; looked as if he were about to have a new\r\nhallucinatory episode. This, however, did not come about until December\r\n1, when he heard cannonading and knew the regiment was near. Next day\r\nhe had forgotten the cannonading. December 14, the patient had become\r\nentirely tranquil and lucid and was able to give his entire history.\r\nDecember 16 and 17 he was given a systematic neurological examination,\r\nwhich showed on the left side complete anesthesia, hyperesthesia to\r\npressure, thermanesthesia, analgesia, loss of bone, tendon, and muscle\r\nsensation. Vision was diminished more on the right side than on the\r\nleft, and the visual fields on this side were more contracted. During\r\nexamination, the fields became still more tubular. There was complete\r\ndeafness, anosmia, and ageusia on the left side. On the right side\r\nthere was a slight diminution of hearing. The pharyngeal reflex\r\nwas abolished; the cremasteric reflex was somewhat less on the left\r\nthan the right; and the defensor reflexes of the left leg were less\r\nmarked than those of the right. There was no clonus or Babinski. The\r\ndynamometer grasp on the right was 37; on the left 18; and on this side\r\nthere was a limitation of voluntary movements.\r\n\r\n                               CHART 10\r\n\r\n                        ETIOLOGY OF SHELL-SHOCK\r\n\r\n    WOUNDS                                                14 of 150\r\n\r\n    PHYSICAL\r\n      EXHAUSTION FROM EXPOSURE, HARDSHIP (all neuropaths)  3 of 142\r\n      CONCUSSION                                          52 of 142\r\n\r\n    CHEMICAL--SHELL GAS                                    3 of 150\r\n\r\n    PSYCHIC\r\n      GRADUAL EXHAUSTION, PREDISPOSING    (43 neuropaths) 51 of 132\r\n      SAME, ACTING PER SE   (patients chiefly neuropaths)\r\n      SUDDEN SHOCK\r\n        HORRIBLE SIGHTS                                   51 of 142\r\n        LOSSES OF COMPANIONS\r\n        FRIGHT NEAR EXPLOSION             (one neuropath)\r\n        SOUNDS                         (a few neuropaths)\r\n\r\n    RELAPSES (41 of 150 observed, three-quarters neuropaths)\r\n\r\n                                                    After Wiltshire\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.

In the present Section we shall study cases for the light\r\nthey may throw on the more technical troubles of the diagnostician.\r\nWho would _à priori_ have felt that such diseases as tetanus, rabies,\r\nmalaria, would produce practical difficulties in clinical diagnosis in\r\nthe field of Shell-shock?\r\n\r\nMayhap there was no need to emphasize further the values of lumbar\r\npuncture fluid examination. Yet the admixture of “functional”\r\nand “organic” symptoms in numerous puzzling cases can hardly be\r\nover-emphasized.\r\n\r\nBut the interpolation, through the ingenious inquiries of Babinski,\r\nof a new or but vaguely suspected series of “reflex” (“physiopathic”)\r\ntroubles between the organic neuropathic disorders on the one hand and\r\nthe hysterical psychopathic disorders on the other--the result of these\r\nobservations, sampled only in Section B, is given more in detail in the\r\npresent Section.

There was no sign of wound. There\r\nwas no motor disorder save that walking was a bit slow and uncertain.\r\nPerhaps the right knee-jerk was stronger than the left. Percussion\r\nof the right Achilles tendon produced tremor. The plantar reflexes\r\nwere flexor on both sides; flexion lasted longer right than left. The\r\ncremasteric and abdominal reflexes were a little weaker on the right.\r\nArm reflexes were lively. Sensations proved normal. Complaint of\r\nheadache, frontal and vertical.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture October 7, that is, on the thirteenth day after the\r\nshell-shock, yielded a transparent, slightly greenish fluid, with 92\r\ncells per cm. (lymphocytes with one or two large mononuclear cells and\r\na few sometimes degenerated endothelial cells) and hyperalbuminosis.\r\n\r\nOctober 9, the clouding of consciousness was less marked. The headaches\r\nand amnesia were constantly complained of; the reflexes were normal.\r\nOctober 12, there was less headache. October 25, another lumbar\r\npuncture showed but 14 or 15 lymphocytes per cm. and hyperalbuminosis.\r\nThere was now no longer any clouding of consciousness. The amnesia,\r\nretrograde and anterograde back to May 9, 1914 (date of his daughter’s\r\nbirth), and up to September 25, 1915, persisted. The man did not\r\nremember the declaration of war, or the mobilization, or his regiment,\r\nand the like. Meantime, the man’s judgment and reasoning powers were\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nIf there had been no early spinal fluid examination of this patient, he\r\nmight well have been considered an hysteric or even a simulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeningeal and intraspinal hemorrhage: Lumbar puncture.\r\n\r\n=Case 372.= (GUILLAIN, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA gunner from Morocco, who lost consciousness for an hour March 28,\r\n1915, upon the explosion of a large-calibre shell in his trench, was\r\ncarried to the ambulance. He complained of headache and generalized\r\npains. His status was scarcely modified during five weeks, and a\r\ngeneralized contracture of the body developed whenever movements were\r\nattempted. In horizontal decubitus, the muscles of the limbs and neck\r\nwere of a normal tonicity, but the head went into hyperflexion if\r\nthe patient was asked to sit. The eyes turned upward, and Kernig’s\r\nsign developed. The patient could walk only with short steps, with\r\nlegs apart and arms held away from the body, the head in a sort of\r\ntetanoid dorsal hyperflexion. There was a right-sided hemiparesis with\r\ntrepidation and the Babinski sign.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture assured the diagnosis of something organic. The\r\nfluid contained blood cells and a marked lymphocytosis. The symptoms\r\nevidently depended upon hemorrhages in the meninges and the nervous\r\nsystem, affecting particularly the right pyramidal tract.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hypothesis of organic changes in hysterical cases, Roussy and\r\nLhermitte remark in comment upon albuminosis in the cerebrospinal fluid\r\nthat the albumin is perhaps due (in cases of camptocormia) to the\r\neffect upon venous and lymphatic circulation of the spinal curvature.\r\nIt was Sicard’s claim that camptocormia, or bent back, was due possibly\r\nto anatomical changes in the spinal column, that is, that camptocormia\r\nwas in one sense a spondylitis. In other cases the camptocormia might\r\nbe due to a ligamentous or muscular change; that is, to a syndesmitis\r\nor a psoitis. His idea was that the curvature was in a sense antalgic;\r\nthat is, a response having the purpose of avoiding pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlight hyperalbuminosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 373.= (RAVAUT, August, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA farmer, 32, in the 66th Infantry, was lying in a dug-out March 5,\r\n1915, when a bomb threw him on the ground and covered him with earth.\r\nHe was picked up unconscious, and remained so for an hour. In the\r\nambulance it was found that he could hardly stand, could not speak,\r\nand appeared to be completely confused. There was no sign of wound.\r\nThe next day he recovered consciousness and complained of a violent\r\nheadache. He was completely deaf in the left ear, and vision was also a\r\nlittle impaired on that side. The puncture fluid was clear, and there\r\nwas a very slight excess of albumin by the heat test. The next day the\r\nheadache had entirely disappeared, the left ear was absolutely deaf,\r\nbut the patient complained of buzzing. Lumbar puncture the following\r\nday showed a normal amount of albumin.\r\n\r\nMarch 16 the patient was evacuated to the rear presenting no abnormal\r\nsymptom except deafness.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the spinal fluid, Armstrong-Jones considers that a shock directly\r\nsustained by the spinal apparatus through sudden impact to the\r\nsurrounding cerebrospinal fluid, ought to be felt more by the anterior\r\nhorn cells than by the spinal root ganglia, since the latter are\r\nshielded by the sheath in the intervertebral spaces. Motor symptoms\r\nwould, naturally, then be more frequent than sensory symptoms. He also\r\nbelieves that the controlling neurones in the intermedio-lateral tracts\r\nthat have to do with the sympathetic system, would be affected just as\r\nanterior horn cells are. Accordingly, the dilated pupils, rapid heart,\r\ndyspnoea, and a variety of precordial pains and disorder of the viscera\r\nwould ensue. The jar would thus be communicated to the neuronic cells\r\nof origin of two types: spinomuscular and preganglionic, leaving the\r\ngangliospinal neurones relatively intact.\r\n\r\n\r\nParaplegia, organic: Lumbar puncture.\r\n\r\n=Case 374.= (JOUBERT, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA gunner, 23, was thrown to the ground, according to his story, by the\r\nexplosion of a large-calibre shell, at eight o’clock in the morning of\r\nSeptember 10, 1914. He could not get up but thought he had not lost\r\nconsciousness. September 13, he arrived at hospital, looking like a man\r\nwith dorsolumbar fracture of the spine. There was, however, no external\r\ninjury. There was a marked paresis of the right upper extremity, with\r\ndiminished sensibility, weakened reflexes, numbness, formication. The\r\nright lower extremity was subject to complete flaccid paralysis, with\r\nlost reflexes, and anesthesia in all respects reached to the belt\r\nlevel, and stopped sharply at the median line of the abdomen. The left\r\nleg, also, was paretic but the muscles could be contracted weakly;\r\nthe knee-jerk was exaggerated; there was a tendency to epileptoid\r\ntrepidation, and the sensations were only slightly diminished. There\r\nwas a Babinski reflex on the right side; the abdominal reflex was\r\nabsent on the left side; both cremasteric reflexes were present.\r\nThe feet at times gave formication. Rectal, bladder, and sphincter\r\nparalysis. Dark albuminous urine, with a few blood cells, was obtained\r\non catheterization. There was an early sacral decubitus; consciousness\r\nwas somewhat clouded. The man made no requests except for something to\r\ndrink, and seemed apathetic.\r\n\r\nLumbar puncture, September 14, yielded hemorrhagic fluid. Three days\r\nlater, the upper extremity regained its powers and sensations, but the\r\nparaplegia had become complete, with abolition of reflexes on both\r\nsides, and absolute anesthesia. The feet yielded formication at times,\r\nhowever. Sacral decubitus increased and healed not. The temperature\r\nvaried between 38 and 39. The patient died September 24, in coma, with\r\nanuria and Cheyne-Stokes breathing.\r\n\r\n\r\nGunshot wound of spinal column; no penetration or injury of dura mater:\r\nAt first quadriplegia; later cerebellospasmodic type of disorder.\r\n\r\n=Case 375.= (CLAUDE and LHERMITTE, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 22, sustained a gunshot wound in the neck about the level\r\nof the fourth cervical vertebra. He immediately became quadriplegic.\r\nHe recovered arm motion in two months and some weeks later ability to\r\nstand and walk.\r\n\r\nThree months after the injury, station was difficult, better on a broad\r\nbase. Rombergism, even with eyes open. Cerebellospasmodic gait. There\r\nwas no weakness of leg muscles, but there was a certain degree of\r\nweakness of the upper extremities, especially in finger flexion. There\r\nwas hypertonia of the muscles of all the extremities and the hands\r\nshowed the signs of Raimiste, of Klippel and Weil, and of Dejerine.\r\nStatic equilibrium was preserved to the will, but the kinetic balance\r\nwas affected, and as much in the upper as in the lower extremities.\r\nAtaxia, tremors, dysmetria, adiadocho-kinesia, and disorder of combined\r\nmovements in thigh and trunk flexion were all in evidence. Meantime,\r\nthere was no disorder of sensation whatever except that the ulnar\r\nborder of the right hand showed a hypobaresthesia, and there was a\r\ndisturbance of tactile discrimination and absolute astereognosis in\r\nthe hands. The deep reflexes were everywhere increased, and ankle and\r\npatellar clonus were easy to excite, especially on the right side.\r\nBilateral defense reflexes. Bilateral Babinski sign. The hypertonia and\r\nataxia ebbed away during the following three months. Walking became\r\nnormal, and there was little sign of difficulty except astereognosis of\r\nboth hands, combined with slight disturbance of deep sensibility and\r\npoor response to compass test in palm.\r\n\r\nWe here deal with a case of spinal column injury without injury to the\r\ndura mater. This cerebellospasmodic form of the superior cervical type\r\nof spinal concussion is less frequent than a quadriplegic form with\r\nBrown-Séquard syndrome. It is striking that both types of concussion\r\nmay recover.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpinal column trauma, with local signs: Later, hysterical anesthesia\r\nand contracture of back muscles homolateral with the trauma.\r\n\r\n=Case 376.= (OPPENHEIM, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA musketeer, wounded August 20, 1914, by a shell splinter in right side\r\nof vertebral column, fell unconscious, but was able afterward to crawl\r\non all-fours out of the firing line. Severe vomiting and epistaxis\r\nfollowed. August 23, there was pain in the small of the back; the last\r\ntwo ribs were painful on right side; and the muscles were slightly\r\nswollen up to the iliac crest. August 30, a slight rise of temperature\r\n(at first it had been above 38) still persisted, but the muscular\r\nswelling was diminished. Treatment by aspirin and baths. No further\r\nrise of temperature after early in September.\r\n\r\nOn October 9, patient was permitted to get up, whereupon he showed a\r\npeculiar curved attitude of the body, reduced almost completely by\r\npassive straightening. Swelling of the longitudinal muscles. Radiograph\r\nnegative, except that one picture showed a change in left twelfth rib,\r\nnear the transverse process. Pains in left lumbar region.\r\n\r\nNovember 19, on examination, pulse 112. November 23, after massage,\r\nvomiting. Temporary use of plaster corset.\r\n\r\nOn admission to the nerve hospital December 22, the musketeer was\r\nunable to extend the trunk, and the long muscles of the back were\r\non the stretch, often as hard as wood, especially those of the\r\nleft (longissimus dorsi). Patient lay on right half of pelvis.\r\nHemianesthesia and hemianalgesia, left side. Tachycardia. Formerly the\r\npatient had done hard work, especially carrying heavy bags. He declined\r\nto be examined under general anesthesia. He seemed to be of unreliable\r\ncharacter, and his trouble did not prevent him from returning from\r\nleave of absence, on one occasion, drunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nMine explosion: Combined hysterical and lesional effects.\r\n\r\n=Case 377.= (DUPOUY, September, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant, 23, was in a mine explosion June 23, coming out in\r\ncomplete torpor, with mutism and retention of urine. He was brought\r\nto hospital June 26, with jactitation, irregular pulse, markedly\r\nexaggerated tendon reflexes, absent skin reflexes, sluggish, dilated\r\npupils, especially right, and general anesthesia. The spinal fluid\r\ncontained an excess of albumin, altered blood cells and many\r\nlymphocytes.\r\n\r\nSeveral hours after puncture he suddenly demanded where he was, thought\r\nit was the year 1911 when he was in the Dragoons, talked about his\r\ncamp, and was confused, irritable and stereotyped in questions. There\r\nwas no verbal amnesia. Speech was hesitant, explosive and scanning,\r\nsuggestive of multiple sclerosis. Next day there was still retrograde\r\namnesia. He clung to the belief that it was July, 1911, and asked\r\nwearisome, stereotyped questions. The words, “German house” caused a\r\njactitation, stiffening and relapse into a _second état_, out of which\r\nhe came with hiccoughs and sighs, and amnestic for this conversation.\r\nThere was general hypesthesia and muscular weakness especially of legs.\r\nThe reflexes were as before.\r\n\r\nThe morning of June 28, he heard the hum of an airplane, whereupon\r\nhis memory returned. It seems that he had himself once ascended. The\r\nmemory gap was now limited to the time immediately preceding the\r\nmine explosion and the days following, up to the time of hearing the\r\nairplane. He told about his military life and also about incidents\r\nimmediately preceding his blowing up. He complained of malaise and of\r\npains in the vertebral column and limbs.\r\n\r\nThere was a quadriparesis, more marked, however, on the left; walking\r\nwith falls to the left; astasia with left foot; double facial paresis;\r\ninability to whistle and to close eyes completely; intestinal and\r\nbladder paralysis; nocturnal emissions non-pleasurable; partial\r\nanesthesia of right leg, of arm and of hand, with hyperesthesia\r\nof thigh, of forearm and of the posterior aspect of the upper arm;\r\nanesthesia of the left side, including thorax and abdomen, excepting\r\nthat the arm was hypesthetic only. Face hyperesthetic. Complete\r\nanesthesia of nipple and testis; hypesthesia of neck; anesthesia of\r\ntongue, nose and vertex; plantar, cremasteric, abdominal reflexes\r\nabsent; exaggerated tendon reflexes; pupil reflexes normal; painful\r\nheat flashes and profuse sweating on the slightest movement; vertigo\r\nand tendencies to syncope after effort; explosive, scanning speech;\r\nintermittent convulsive movements of the arms. Palpation and X-ray show\r\nseparation of the spinous processes of the third cervical vertebra.\r\n\r\nImprovement was marked and progressive in motor, sensory and reflex\r\nfields. At the time of report three months later, there was a definite\r\nparesis of the left leg, with anesthesia and absent plantar reflexes,\r\nand slight paresis of the orbicularis palpebrarum, scanning speech\r\nand syncopal tendencies. Here, then, due to diffuse, non-systematic\r\nlesions, with superadded hysterical manifestations, were probably some\r\neffects of a permanent nature due to destructive processes.\r\n\r\n_Re_ combination of functional and lesional effects, Sollier and\r\nChartier state that in Shell-shock hysteria, physical causes\r\nand conditions are the chief factors; that in the so-called\r\nhystero-traumatism of Charcot, the psychic and physical factors are of\r\nvirtually equal importance, and that in ordinary cases of hysteria, the\r\npsychic is the chief genetic factor.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion: Hysterical and organic symptoms.\r\n\r\n=Case 378.= (HURST, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA champion heavy-weight boxer, 29, was unconscious for two days after\r\nbeing knocked over by the explosion of a shell in December, 1914. He\r\nfound at first that he could not move the right arm or left leg; and\r\nafter power had returned to the limbs, he had forcible involuntary\r\nmovements in the left leg whenever he tried to stand. Examined, April\r\n1, 1915, he answered questions slowly and with slow words; the right\r\narm was weak. When the left hand was clenched, an associated movement\r\ntook place in the right hand, but not vice versa. There was, however,\r\nno diminution in the girth of the muscles. The man was unable to\r\nlocalize light tactile stimuli accurately. Movements of the left leg\r\nwere somewhat weak, the left knee-jerk was slightly brisker than the\r\nright; ankle clonus could be obtained on the left side and Babinski\r\nsecond sign (paralyzed leg rising higher than the normal leg in\r\ncombined flexion of thigh and pelvis). When the man tried to walk, the\r\nleft leg moved rapidly from side to side round the point of contact of\r\nthe toes. When the right leg moved forward, the left dragged behind in\r\nirregular movement.\r\n\r\nEvery effort to cure the patient by means of suggestion during\r\nhospital care for a month entirely failed. Although the man was easily\r\nhypnotizable, he could not be made to move his leg under the deepest\r\nhypnosis. The first whiff of ether hypnotized him, so that the method\r\nof etherization could not be used in the endeavor to control the leg\r\nmovements. Over a year later, July, 1916, the patient had greatly\r\nimproved mentally but was otherwise in precisely the condition that is\r\nabove described.\r\n\r\n\r\nGunshot wound of buttocks with injury to cauda equina: Urinary\r\ndisturbance; decubitus; anesthesia. Superimposed paraplegia, regarded\r\nas functional and cured by psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n=Case 379.= (OPPENHEIM, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA German grenadier, October 11, 1914, was wounded in the left buttock\r\nby a missile that passed out through the right buttock. Pains in the\r\nabdomen and legs followed. The man had to be catheterized on the\r\nbattle-field.\r\n\r\nOctober 23, he suddenly fell down with total paralysis of both legs.\r\n\r\nNovember 3, numerous small furuncles appeared on the buttocks, and\r\nbedsores developed. The patient lay helpless in bed, was unable to sit\r\nup without support, or to turn from one side to the other, and had\r\nareas of anesthesia.\r\n\r\nDuring November and December, there was persistent high temperature,\r\nbetween 38 and 40; but January 3 the temperature stood at 36.6.\r\n\r\nJanuary 7 the patient was admitted to a nerve hospital. At this time\r\nhe was able to pass urine unaided, though with tenesmus and pain,\r\nsometimes nausea and a tendency to vomit. He complained of pain in\r\nthe back and pelvic region; the legs lay as if paralyzed. No active\r\nmovement whatever was performed. There was a marked increase of tendon\r\nreflexes (even including the semi-membranosus). The muscles were\r\nrelaxed through disuse but there was no atrophy. The patient moved\r\nhis legs about with his hands. Sensibility was preserved except in\r\nthe region of the pubis. The plantar reflexes were absent. Electrical\r\nreactions normal.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis was functional paralysis of the legs (previous gunshot\r\ninjury of cauda equina).\r\n\r\nTreatment with psychotherapy met with prompt results; within a few\r\ndays, the patient learned to move his legs and to walk with support,\r\nthough making enormous efforts which threw the pulse up to about 160\r\nand made the face congested. The bladder disturbance and the sacral\r\nanesthesia persisted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpinal concussion with spinal cord lesion: Thermanesthesia and\r\nanalgesia of right leg and side.\r\n\r\n=Case 380.= (BUZZARD, December, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn officer was hit in the back by a shrapnel fragment, fell paralyzed,\r\nbut after a few minutes was able to walk more than a mile to the\r\ndressing station. Eventually arriving in London, he had nothing to\r\ncomplain of except the wound, as the foreign body had been removed in\r\nFrance. The wound healed and the patient went to a convalescent home.\r\n\r\nHowever, when taking a bath he could not feel the temperature of the\r\nwater with the right leg. Muscular power was perfect; reflexes normal;\r\nbut the heat, cold and pain sense was lacking in the right leg and the\r\nright side of the body from the seventh costal cartilage downwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne may make a wrong diagnosis of “Shell-shock.”\r\n\r\n=Case 381.= (BUZZARD, December, 1916.)\r\n\r\nIn August, 1915, an officer was blown many yards by a shell, lay\r\nunconscious a while, could find no bruises, and carried on for\r\ntwenty-four hours. Then, finding legs unreliable, he reported sick\r\nand was sent home as “Shell-shock.” He remained “Shell-shock” until\r\nFebruary, 1916, then being able to walk five or six miles on smooth\r\nground. Going downstairs he took the step with left foot rather than\r\nwith right, and the right was apt to turn in. The sense of position and\r\nmovement in regard to the right foot proved to be faulty. He could not\r\nbalance himself on the right foot, nor could he appreciate tuning fork\r\nvibrations as well on this foot as on the other.\r\n\r\nAn X-ray examination showed a slight fracture, without deformity, in\r\nthe left post-Rolandic region near the median line. His helmet had been\r\nbashed in at this point, and the bruised brain yielded symptoms even\r\neight months later.\r\n\r\n\r\nRetention of urine after shell-shock.\r\n\r\n=Case 382.= (GUILLAIN and BARRÉ, November, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman underwent shell-shock December 19, 1915, from the\r\nexplosion of a torpedo nearby. He arrived at the ambulance, unable\r\nto speak, and next day had a confusional crisis of convulsions with\r\ncontractures. He had not urinated since the accident, and two liters of\r\nclear urine were withdrawn by catheter; after which, the patient rested\r\nquietly and gradually regained consciousness. He was catheterized again\r\nin the evening and clear urine withdrawn. He remained unable to urinate\r\nspontaneously until December 25, and was catheterized accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere was no motor, sensory, or reflex disorder in this patient. Lumbar\r\npuncture yielded a normal fluid; the pupils were normal, and the only\r\nappearance was that of a marked asthenia.\r\n\r\nThree months after his shell-shock, in March, 1916, the soldier was\r\nonce more examined and still complained of headache, weakness, and\r\ninability to walk more than four or five hundred meters without a\r\ncertain trembling of the legs. The reflexes remained normal and no\r\nfurther bladder trouble had supervened.\r\n\r\n_Re_ anuria, Babinski remarks that, in days of yore, hysteria was\r\nsupposed to be able to produce anuria as well as albuminuria, and even\r\nsuch organic changes as vesicles of the skin, ulceration, hemorrhages\r\nin the skin or of the viscera, fever, and even gangrene. He remarks\r\nthat of late years no single identifiable case of this sort proved\r\nto be hysterical, has been reported. This is aside, of course, from\r\nsuch superficial and quickly passing vasomotor disorders as erythema\r\nand dermatographia. Anuria and albuminuria have consequently passed\r\nfrom the textbooks on hysteria, just as Babinski believes that\r\nhysterical edema and hysterical exaggeration of the reflexes are bound\r\nto pass. Hysteria cannot imitate everything; it cannot reproduce the\r\ncharacteristic phenomena of organic paralysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nRetention of urine after shell-shock.\r\n\r\n=Case 383.= (GUILLAIN and BARRÉ, November 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 27, underwent shell-shock August 16, 1916, at\r\nfour o’clock, from the nearby explosion of a big shell. He lost\r\nconsciousness for a period of ten minutes, was sent to the regimental\r\naid post, and twelve hours later brought to a hospital center, in a\r\nstate of profound muscular weakness. He could not walk although he\r\ncould make every movement of the legs. There was a marked diffuse\r\ncutaneous hyperesthesia. The reflexes were normal; the pupils were\r\nunequal, the right myotic. The lumbar puncture yielded a clear fluid\r\nunder normal pressure, but with an excess of albumin. For three days,\r\nretention of urine was absolute, requiring the catheter. There was\r\nneither sugar nor albumin in the urine withdrawn. On the fourth day he\r\nwas able to urinate spontaneously; the asthenia and other symptoms had\r\ndisappeared in two or three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncontinence of urine after shell-shock and burial.\r\n\r\n=Case 384.= (GUILLAIN and BARRÉ, November, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman was subject to shell explosion and burial May 10, 1917.\r\nHe lost consciousness for a few hours and spat blood for two days. He\r\nwas carried to an evacuation hospital and thence to the neurological\r\ncenter at Amiens. Incontinence day and night lasted from the period of\r\nshock up to May 29, when the patient was transferred again, to another\r\nhospital. The man had never, either in childhood or adult life, had\r\nincontinence. He showed a slight tendency to latero-pulsion toward the\r\nleft. Puncture fluid normal.\r\n\r\nGuillain and Barré report but 12 cases of sphincter disorder following\r\nshell-shock without external wound among hundreds of cases, and\r\namong 12 instances of sphincter disorder there were but three of\r\nincontinence, of which the above is one example. Incontinence lasted\r\nlonger in these cases than retention. Guillain and Barré are unable to\r\nassign a cause for the findings.\r\n\r\n\r\nStruck in back by shell splinter: Crural monoplegia; absence of plantar\r\nreflex.\r\n\r\n=Case 385.= (PAULIAN, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 20, was struck by a shell fragment in the small of the\r\nback while lying in the firing position, about 2 P.M. August 22, 1914,\r\nat Eth in Belgium. He felt as if he had been struck by the butt of a\r\ngun in the lumbar region. He was unable to get back with his comrades.\r\nHis sack had been cut. He was without ammunition, and getting to a\r\nbridge he was able to jump a distance of about 8 meters. He fell and\r\nfainted. On coming to himself, his left side felt bad and he could not\r\nmove his left leg. He dragged himself to the relief post which was\r\nbeing bombarded just as he arrived, and he got a bullet in the left\r\nfrontal region.\r\n\r\nHe was evacuated to another ambulance and decided to go back to\r\nFrance. Supported by his Lieutenant, he walked all night making about\r\n35 kilometers on foot. He arrived at Charancy and got by train to\r\nMont-Midi. On alighting, he could not walk. He said he was bent in two,\r\nand shuffled on in this position.\r\n\r\nThe “bent-back” lasted about a month, when he began to stand up\r\nagain. He passed through various hospitals and was evacuated to the\r\nSalpêtrière. He then walked with the left leg in extension on the thigh\r\nand the foot in external rotation. He was hardly able to stand on\r\neither foot, and especially fell if he tried to stand on the left foot.\r\nHe made no resistance to passive movements of the left lower extremity.\r\nThe reflexes were normal except that the left plantar reflex was\r\nabolished. On the right, the plantar reflex was normal, and an attempt\r\nto elicit this reflex was followed by strong defensive movements. There\r\nwas a tactile, thermic, and pain anesthesia of the foot and leg as far\r\nup as the lower third of the thigh. Above this anesthesia, there was a\r\nzone of hypesthesia. Position sense was also abolished in this region,\r\nand there was a bony hypesthesia likewise. A slight muscular atrophy (2\r\ncm.) affected the lower leg and thigh.\r\n\r\nThere were no hereditary or acquired features of importance in the case\r\nexcept that there had been at 14 a chorea for a year. In particular\r\nthis man appears not to have been an emotional person.\r\n\r\nThe point in the case is the abolition of the plantar reflex on\r\nthe left side, in association with a functional paraplegia and\r\nhemianesthesia.\r\n\r\n_Re_ plantar reflex modification in hysteria, Babinski believes that\r\nthe same law which holds that hysteria is not in line to alter either\r\nthe tendon reflexes or the pupil reflexes, is true for the skin\r\nreflexes. Dejerine brought forward three cases which appeared to him,\r\nhowever, to demonstrate absolutely that functional anesthesia might\r\nabolish or greatly diminish the skin reactions of the sole of the foot,\r\nthat is, the plantar reflexes and movements of defense. Case 385 was\r\nalleged in support of Dejerine, as also were cases of Jeanselme and\r\nHuet, and of Sollier. Babinski’s critique of Dejerine’s cases ran to\r\nthe effect that two of them showed contractures, and accordingly were\r\nnot pure cases in which to demonstrate plantar reflexes or movements of\r\ndefense. In the third case, Babinski at a meeting of the Neurological\r\nSociety, himself obtained definite flexion of the little toes by\r\nstimulating the planta. According to Babinski, therefore, Dejerine’s\r\ncases, far from proving that hysterical anesthesia could abolish the\r\nplantar cutaneous reflexes, proved that hysterical contracture might\r\nmask reflex movements. Hysterical contracture, therefore, may be as\r\nimportant a factor to consider _re_ reflexes as voluntary muscular\r\ncontracture itself. As Babinski pointed out, many normal persons can\r\nkeep the leg immobile when the sole is stimulated. Moreover, Babinski\r\npointed out, many cases regarded as hysterical were actually cases of\r\na physiopathic or reflex nature which had actually undergone trauma.\r\nIt will be noted that the above case of Paulian is just such a case of\r\ntrauma.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; unconsciousness: Crural monoplegia; sciatica (neural\r\nchanges).\r\n\r\n=Case 386.= (SOUQUES, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA reserve lieutenant, September, 1914, was blown up by a shell and\r\nlost consciousness for an hour. On coming to, he felt pains in the\r\nloins, right thigh, knee and heel, and found himself unable to move\r\nthe right leg at all. Urinary incontinence lasted three or four days.\r\nViolent pains lasted weeks, now and then actual crises (sleep only with\r\nhypnotics).\r\n\r\nThe pains then passed off. The flaccid crural monoplegia lasted. There\r\nwas a hydrarthrosis of the right knee and a sciatica (physical nerve\r\nchanges?) and a crural monoplegia without trophic, electrical, reflex\r\nor vesico-rectal trouble. Lumbar puncture showed no lymphocytes or\r\nexcess of albumin. It would, of course, be difficult to tell whether\r\nthis case was hysteria or simulation.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hysterical monoplegia, Babinski inquires whether a hysterical\r\nmonoplegia can automatically appear as a result of emotion without any\r\nintellectual element whatever. Emotion produces sweat, diarrhea or\r\nerythema, without any intellectual intermediate. Can emotion--that is,\r\nemotional shock--produce a monoplegia in the same way as it produces\r\nan erythema? The narratives of patients might indicate that emotion\r\ncan do such things. But according to Babinski there is no genuine case\r\nof monoplegia or paraplegia directly produced by emotional shock. One\r\nmust be careful in this discussion not to confuse emotional shock and\r\nemotion of a gradual nature. Babinski wishes to define emotion as a\r\nviolent affective change as a result of a sudden mental shock upsetting\r\nphysiologic or psychic balance during a usually brief period. As for\r\nthe more gradual affective states or emotions, there is obviously so\r\nmuch of the imaginative and intellectual compounded therewith, that\r\nplenty of opportunity exists for the production by suggestion of such\r\nphenomena as monoplegia, paraplegia, hemi-anesthesia.\r\n\r\n_Re_ sciatica, see remarks above under Case 329.\r\n\r\n\r\nFunctional paraplegia and internal popliteal neuritis.\r\n\r\n=Case 387.= (ROUSSY, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Zouave was taken out from under a trench shelter beam, the night of\r\nDecember 21, 1914, at Tracy-le-Mont. The beam had fallen upon eight\r\nmen, killing one, and striking the Zouave in the hypogastrium. He was\r\npulled out two hours later, unable to take a step. He was evacuated\r\non his back, to Paris; stayed a month in the hospital at Croix-Rouge,\r\nbedfast. According to the patient, he was entirely anesthetic in the\r\nlegs. He went to Villejuif, January 22, with the diagnosis of spinal\r\ncontusion and hemiplegia. He could then walk on crutches, leaning on\r\nthe left leg. He felt a sharp pain at the level of the spinous process\r\nof the first lumbar vertebra and all along the sacrum. Spontaneous\r\nmovements of the left leg were possible, but they were slow and weak.\r\nThe hypesthesia rose to the navel. There was a suggestion of a cauda\r\nsyndrome. The knee-jerks were normal, but on the left side the Achilles\r\njerk was absent. There was a partial R. D. in the posterior muscles of\r\nthe left leg.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis was functional paraplegia plus left internal popliteal\r\nneuritis. The crutches were removed, he was isolated, and given motor\r\nreëducation. In a week he was able to walk alone with ease.\r\n\r\n_Re_ popliteal nerve lesions, Athanassio-Benisty remarks that the\r\nexternal popliteal nerve of the leg resembles pathologically the\r\nmusculospiral nerve of the arm, whereas the internal popliteal behaves\r\nlike the median. The musculospiral nerve of the arm shows very variable\r\nand usually slight sensory changes. The median nerve more than any\r\nother nerve in the arm yields painful sensations during its recovery\r\nfrom section.\r\n\r\n_Re_ differentiation of peripheral neuritis and hysterical paralysis,\r\nBabinski gives as signs peculiar to neuritis, and never found in\r\nhysterical paralysis, the following: (_a_) diminution or loss of\r\nbone and tendon reflexes; (_b_) muscular atrophy (except for slight\r\namyotrophy exceptionally found in hysteria); (_c_) the reaction of\r\ndegeneration (only of value after eight or ten days); (_d_) hypotonus;\r\n(_e_) distribution characteristic of peripheral motor sensory and\r\ntrophic disorder.\r\n\r\n_Re_ diagnosis of organic paraplegia as against hysterical paraplegia,\r\nthe latter is to be recognized chiefly by the absence of the organic\r\nsigns, as (_a_) alteration of tendon reflexes, (_b_) the Babinski\r\nsign (toe phenomenon), (_c_) exaggeration of defense reflexes (dorsal\r\nflexion of foot on sharp pinching of dorsum of foot or leg), (_d_)\r\nmuscular atrophy with R. D., (_e_) sphincter disorder, (_f_) skin\r\nchanges, such as decubitus.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet in hip: Local “stupor” of leg.\r\n\r\n=Case 388.= (SEBILEAU, November, 1914.)\r\n\r\nA Moroccan sharpshooter, 20, was wounded September 27, at Soissons.\r\nOne bullet scratched the left thigh. A second entered below the\r\nanterosuperior iliac spine at least 6 cm. outside the femoral artery\r\nand emerged above the ischiotrochanteric line, 2 cm. above and 4 cm.\r\nbehind the upper extremity of the great trochanter, thus passing\r\nthrough the tensor of the fascia lata and without breaking a bone.\r\n\r\nThere was a complete paralysis of the left leg. The man had to walk\r\nwith a crutch and a cane, dragging the leg like a weight. There was\r\nno active or passive movement of thigh, lower leg and foot muscles,\r\nexcept that there was a slight tendency to abduction of the toes, from\r\ninnervation of the dorsal interossei of the foot. The iliopsoas was\r\nalso involved, as well as the gluteal and pelvic trochanteric muscles.\r\nThere was a certain amount of muscular tone preserved, so that the bony\r\nelements of the skeleton were held together. The foot did not fall\r\nand the leg did not elongate, as it might have in a case of paralysis\r\nof the sciatic nerve. Electro-diagnosis showed an early reaction of\r\ndegeneration according to one examiner, but Sebileau believes that\r\nthere was no R. D. There was anesthesia of a large part of the leg,\r\nwhich stretched over the anterior and internal aspects of the thigh,\r\ncovered the entire territory of obturator and crural nerves but did not\r\nstretch above the fold of the groin. The region of the femorocutaneous\r\nnerve was slightly sensitive and the posterior aspect of the thigh and\r\nbuttock was sensitive. There was a slight sensation on the external\r\naspect of the lower leg. Foot and toes were entirely insensitive.\r\nThe anesthesia was for all forms of common sensation. No vasomotor,\r\nthermic or trophic disorder. The reflexes were all abolished, except\r\nfor a tendency to cremasteric reflex. It is clear that these conditions\r\ncannot be simulated. Possibly they are hysteric and to be explained\r\non the basis of a kind of autosuggestion or perhaps, according to\r\nSebileau, the local and nervous apparatus under the mechanical and\r\ncaloric effects of the fragment had undergone a sort of local stupor.\r\nNo large nerve could have been affected by the injury, according to the\r\nanalysis made by Sebileau.\r\n\r\n_Re_ stupor, see Case 253 of Tinel. _Re_ such local “stupor” it may\r\nbe noted that this case was published in 1914, before Babinski’s\r\nlarger publications on reflex disorders. As for the loss of cutaneous\r\nreflexes, Babinski remarks that immersion in hot water may cause the\r\ncutaneous reflexes in the so-called physiopathic cases to reappear for\r\na time. He regards the loss of cutaneous reflexes in the physiopathic\r\ncases as due to a circulatory disturbance, and recalls the fact that\r\ncompression by an Esmarch bandage can cause the tendon reflexes to\r\nvanish for a time, and can even cause pathologically excessive reflexes\r\nto disappear. The cutaneous reflexes have also been caused to disappear\r\nby compression.\r\n\r\nAccording to Babinski, Sebileau’s explanation that such matters as loss\r\nof reflexes could be explained by autosuggestion is erroneous.\r\n\r\n_Re_ muscular hypertonus in reflex cases, Babinski remarks that though\r\nit may be very pronounced, it is as a rule restricted in area. _Re_\r\nsensory disorders in reflex cases, pains are found (they were very\r\nslight ones in the present case); hypesthesia has also been found by\r\nBabinski.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocalized catalepsy: Hysterotraumatic.\r\n\r\n=Case 389.= (SOLLIER, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn invalided soldier had been suffering for a year with marked\r\natrophies and the right knee in extension. There had been a bullet\r\nwound of the upper third of the tibia, which did not affect the joint.\r\nThere was a total anesthesia, both superficial and deep, which stopped\r\nsharply at the upper part of the thigh. At the time of the very\r\nfirst examination, this apparent ankylosis was reduced, to the great\r\nstupefaction of the patient. There was, however, a peculiar phenomenon\r\nin this subject. There was a localized catalepsy of the limb, which\r\nwas able to preserve any desired attitude in which it was placed; and\r\nthis attitude could be indefinitely prolonged, just as in cataleptic\r\nhysterics. Here, then, was a case of localized hystero-traumatism\r\nprecisely imitating the classical hysteria of Charcot except for its\r\nlocalization.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hysterotraumatism, Charcot developed ideas concerning trauma and\r\nlocalized hysteria in 1886, thereby overthrowing the ideas of Erichsen\r\nconcerning the organic nature of “railway spine” and “railway brain” as\r\ndeveloped twenty years before. In a case of local trauma such as the\r\nbullet-wound of Case 388, Babinski’s explanation would be that the pain\r\nand inhibition of movement resulting from the bullet wound at the time\r\nof injury, formed the focus of a process of autosuggestion. According\r\nto Babinski’s figure, the organic factor acts as a _bait_ for the\r\nhysterical symptoms. According to the Salpêtrière experience, hysteria\r\nis incapable of producing a real superficial and deep anesthesia such\r\nas is mentioned for this case. For example, no hysterical patient\r\nin the Charcot clinic, according to Sicard, could undergo a scalpel\r\noperation without some general or local anesthetic. When, therefore,\r\na true deep anesthesia occurs, Sicard’s conception would be that the\r\nanesthesia is not a truly hysterical one but belongs to the group of\r\nphysiopathic phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nContracture: Hysterotraumatic.\r\n\r\n=Case 390.= (SOLLIER, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA sailor, 41, got hygroma of the right knee in 1915, was operated on in\r\nJuly, returned to his dépôt a month later, and thence to Vizille Urage\r\nby reason of contracture in extension of the right leg. It was thought\r\nhe was simulating (since there was no muscular atrophy), and he was\r\nsent to the neurological center, where under anesthesia the joint was\r\nfound free. This man developed, when the knee was bent, extraordinary\r\ncracklings in the joint, and he showed pain unequivocally, making a\r\ndefensive movement, partly reflex, partly voluntary, when the leg was\r\nflexed beyond a certain point. There was 3.5 cm. atrophy in the thigh,\r\na reflex atrophy due to the joint disorder. There were no other signs\r\nof hysterotraumatic contracture.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sollier, the diagnosis of hysterotraumatic contractures\r\ndepends upon: first, a characteristic special attitude of the\r\ncontractured limb; secondly, the participation of the antagonists as a\r\ngroup (_global_); thirdly, the superposition of sensory disorder upon\r\nmotor disorder (Charcot’s law); fourthly, the segmentary topography\r\nof sensory disorder; fifthly, the extension of the contractured\r\njoint; sixthly, the persistence of the contracture in the same form,\r\nwhether at rest or in attempted movements; seventhly, muscular\r\nrigidity; eighthly, normal tendon reflexes; ninthly, normal electrical\r\nreactions (though R. D. is hard to determine in muscles contracted to\r\nthe maximum); tenthly, special reactions during attempts to reduce,\r\nsuch as pains, and equal and regular resistance to changed attitude,\r\npseudoclonus in cases of foot contracture; eleventhly, immediate\r\nreproduction of the contracture after reduction under chloroform;\r\ntwelfthly, co-existence of various hysterical stigmata.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrural monoplegia, tetanic. Recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 391.= (ROUTIER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn ensign was wounded by a shell splinter in the right scapular region\r\nSeptember 25, 1915. A large hematoma was drawn off and drains inserted.\r\nAntitetanic serum was given 24 hours after the trauma. The wound looked\r\nwell. The patient complained merely of the heaviness of his arm, and\r\nafter September 27, the temperature fell to normal. Magnesium chloride\r\nsolution was applied every other day, and progress was so good that\r\nevacuation was ordered.\r\n\r\nHowever, October 8, the patient suddenly began to complain of a sharp\r\npain in the right thigh, which next day became intolerable and threw\r\nthe muscles into a slight contracture, the adductors being extremely\r\nstiff. Headache developed in the course of the day, with slight\r\nstiffness of neck, exaggeration of reflexes in the right leg, and\r\nankle clonus. Temperature: 37.6 morning, 38.5 evening. The patient was\r\nisolated and given chloral.\r\n\r\nOctober 10, paroxysmal crises of pain, more marked stiff neck,\r\nand lumbar stiffness appeared, with nervousness, photophobia, and\r\nhyperesthesia to noise. The wound seemed to be doing well. Chloral was\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nSlight trismus developed October 11. The tongue became dry and the\r\npatient drank little. The condition held and the same treatments\r\nwere repeated up to October 15, when the temperature fell and the\r\ncontractures and pains were diminished. The chloral was continued.\r\nThere were still a few cramps in the neck. October 22, however, the\r\npatient was practically well.\r\n\r\nWe are here dealing with an instance of local tetanus of monoplegic\r\nform, developing a fortnight after the wound (there is an early group\r\ndeveloping, as a rule, from the fifth to the tenth day, and a group of\r\nlater development, after the twentieth day; the interval in this case\r\nwas of intermediate duration). According to Courtois-Suffit and Giroux,\r\nthe differential diagnosis is not easy, since, besides tetanus, must\r\nbe considered tetany, spastic monoplegia of cerebral or spinal origin,\r\npartial hemiplegia, peripheral neuritis, contractures due to bone,\r\njoint, muscle or tendon lesions, strychnine intoxication and hysterical\r\ncontractures. Three cases out of six described by Routier were fatal.\r\n\r\n_Re_ differential diagnosis of tetanic conditions, see Courtois-Suffit\r\nand Giroux in the _Collection Horizon_. The cases as a rule appear in\r\nsubjects that have had serum treatment, and may occur in subjects in\r\nwhom no trismus ever develops (the above case showed slight trismus).\r\n\r\nThe recognition of localized tetanic contracture is based upon (_a_)\r\nthe intensity of the contracture, which causes the limb to feel wooden\r\n(in one case the foot, leg, and thigh were welded to the pelvis like an\r\niron bar); (_b_) paroxysmal contractions resembling those of tetanus,\r\nconfined to one limb, and started by a variety of external causes,\r\nforming the principal symptom in the disease; (_c_) contracture of\r\ncomparatively brief duration (hardly ever over two or three weeks). A\r\nslight fever may help in the differential diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWound of left leg: Local spasms, later contracture, and painful crises\r\n(these associated with suppuration), the whole treated as tetanic.\r\n\r\n=Case 392.= (MÉRIEL, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman was wounded by shell fragments September 28, 1915, at\r\nVirginy and was given a first dressing an hour later and a second at\r\nthe ambulance, where antitetanic injection was also made. October 3,\r\nthe patient arrived at Foix, showing a superficial wound of the left\r\nfrontal region, a penetrating wound of the upper third of the left\r\nthigh, and another in the lower third of the left lower leg.\r\n\r\nThe evening of October 8, the man began to feel pain in the left leg,\r\nthough the wounds looked well and there was no fever. October 9, sudden\r\ninvoluntary contractions of the left leg developed, and these increased\r\nin amplitude if the limb was touched. The other extremities were\r\nnormal. Temperature 38.2; pulse 102. Restlessness at night.\r\n\r\nNext day 10 c.c. of antitetanic serum was administered and more on\r\nthe 11th, with chloral and isolation; but on the evening of the 11th,\r\nwith the contractions still completely localized to the left lower\r\nextremity, came an extremely painful crisis interfering with sleep and\r\nat last requiring morphine. Up to the 15th the antitetanic injections,\r\nchloral and morphine were continued, but on the 15th the contractions\r\nwere replaced in part by a contracture affecting the muscles of the\r\nposterior aspect of the thigh. In the meantime, the patient howled with\r\npain, especially in the night. Chloral and morphine were given.\r\n\r\nDuring the next five days the contractures and pains became still more\r\nviolent, and on the 21st the antitetanic injections were begun once\r\nmore and kept up through the 26th in 5 c.c. doses.\r\n\r\nThe patient began to urinate in bed and to be delirious. The\r\ncontractions now disappeared, but the contracture persisted.\r\nAntitetanic serum was given every other day from October 28 to November\r\n2; every third day from November 4 to November 19; every fourth day\r\nfrom November 22 to December 3; and every fifth day from December 3 to\r\nDecember 17. The chloral was diminished from 15 to 5 grams per diem and\r\nby the 20th of December all administration of chloral had ceased. The\r\nmorphine was given up December 25.\r\n\r\nThe tetanic symptoms of the left leg now gradually diminished. The\r\nleg, which had been flexed at a right angle, began to extend little\r\nby little, and the toes, which had been strongly flexed, reassumed\r\ntheir normal position. The wounds suppurated freely during the tetanic\r\ncrises, but then healed. In January the man could get up and walk,\r\ndragging his leg somewhat, and January 20 a complete recovery had\r\nbeen obtained. There was no hysteria in the history of this patient,\r\nalthough the man was subject to “professional” alcoholism, being carter\r\nfor a wholesale wine dealer, drinking 5 liters of wine a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock by windage: Hysterical paraplegia, flaccid type, develops\r\n10 days later, after strain, capture, privation, recapture. Paraplegia\r\nat first complete. Recovery by suggestion (one séance).\r\n\r\n=Case 393.= (LÉRI, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA corporal, 21, told how at Goselmind, during the Sarrebourg retreat,\r\nAugust 20, 1914, a shell burst a meter behind him, flattening his\r\nknapsack, throwing him to the ground, blowing him forward (as he\r\nsaid, by the pressure of the air) seven or eight meters, leaving him\r\nstunned though conscious for about twenty minutes. Uhlans fell upon\r\nhim but did not trouble themselves further with him as he could not\r\nwalk. He crawled along on elbows and knees about a kilometer and a\r\nhalf to some Frenchmen in a wood. He now found himself able to walk a\r\nwhole day supported by two comrades, making about 12 kilometers. He\r\ngot by carriage to Gerbéviller, but here fell again into the hands of\r\nGermans, who left him nine days in the corner of a barn without care.\r\nGerbéviller was retaken, and he was evacuated to Bayon.\r\n\r\nHe had now had for some time pains in the kidney region below the point\r\nstruck, some difficulty in turning his head, and some numbness and\r\njerkings in the legs; and the legs that had carried him 14 kilometers\r\nwere unable to move at all, even in bed. It was only 8 days later\r\nthat he could perform the slightest movement, and two months followed\r\nbefore he could go a few steps on crutches. December 14, three months\r\nand a half after his accident,--he was demonstrated as “spinal\r\ncontusion.” Upon examination, however, there were no reflex disorders,\r\nno sensory disorders, and the muscular weakness was equal in all parts\r\nof the lower extremities and trunk. On crutches, he lunged the trunk\r\nforward, painfully dragging his legs one after the other, the right\r\nfoot in external rotation, never passing the left foot, toes scraping\r\nground,--a functional flaccid paraplegia, completely dissolved by\r\nsuggestion at a single sitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nScalp wound; probably no loss of consciousness: Quadriparesis, later\r\nparaplegia; tremors; profound sensory disorders, some apparently\r\nhysterical; cataleptic rigidity of (anesthetic) legs on passive\r\nmovement. Diagnosis?\r\n\r\n=Case 394.= (CLARKE, July, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 40, got a scalp wound but probably did not lose\r\nconsciousness. However, when observed three months after the injury,\r\nthough fat and well-looking, the patient could not stand or walk, and\r\nhis hands and arms were feeble. He complained of headache, insomnia\r\nand anorexia, and remained in a state of mental inertia. All efforts\r\nto read and write produced fatigue. Memory was bad both for remote\r\nand for recent events. He was able to feed himself slowly, execute\r\na few movements of arms and hands, and raise his feet from the bed.\r\nUpon passive movement, there was a sort of spastic state, which\r\ndid not amount to a true rigidity. Now and then a clonic spasm was\r\ninduced by such passive movements. After the repetition of those few\r\nvoluntary movements which were possible, the muscles passed into a\r\nflaccid condition. There was a tremor of a type called swooping; the\r\ntremor resembled that of Friedreich’s disease, such as is thought to\r\noccur in cases of marked loss of muscular sense. The deep reflexes\r\nwere exaggerated. Concentric narrowing of the visual fields was\r\neasily induced by testing them. There was a general slight dulness of\r\nperception on sensory tests. There was astereognosis, and apparently an\r\nabsolute loss of position sense. Movements of the large joints through\r\nan angle of 90 degrees were, however, vaguely recognized. Although the\r\npatient could not touch, for example, his left forefinger with his\r\nright, yet, if he had once seen the position of a limb and it was not\r\nmoved, he could remember its position and touch it after some time.\r\nHis localizing sense was from two to four inches out in the hands, the\r\nlocalization being generally of points proximal to the point tested.\r\n\r\nTwo months later the patient was somewhat less dull and apathetic.\r\nHis memory had improved. He was able to read, and he was successfully\r\nmaking a rug; but the legs were worse, having become anesthetic to\r\ntouch and pain. When the legs were placed in any position, they would\r\nassume a cataleptic rigidity, and remain rigidly fixed in any position\r\nfor some time. The patient could sit up in bed. The muscles were well\r\nnourished and the electric reactions were normal.\r\n\r\n_Re_ catatonic rigidity, see Case 389 (Sollier).\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion; pitched in air: Spasmodic contractions of sartorii,\r\npersistent in sleep.\r\n\r\n=Case 395.= (MYERS, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private, 23, was admitted to a casualty clearing station and the next\r\nday told the examiner, Major Myers, that the Germans had been sending\r\nwhizz-bangs and coal-boxes over, and the last he remembered was being\r\non guard and then digging himself out of fallen sandbags. His comrades\r\ntold him that he had been pitched in the air, but this he did not\r\nremember. He remembered running to the shell trench, but finding this\r\n“too hot,” he returned to the firing trench, noticing on the way that\r\nhe could not see well. He lay in the dug-out, flinching at each shell,\r\nand “trying to get into the smallest possible corner.” He tried to do\r\nguard duty that night, but, when some one noticed involuntary spasmodic\r\nmovements, he was ordered to go back to the dug-out, was helped to the\r\nregimental aid post by two men, and was sent to hospital. He had been\r\nin France eight months and had been shaken up somewhat four months\r\nbefore, when bombs threw dirt in his face. At that time, his hands and\r\nhandwriting had become tremulous, but he had not reported sick. He\r\nwas depressed and wanted Major Myers to make him well. It seems that\r\nhe had shrugged his shoulders and made leg movements, diving beneath\r\nthe bedclothes, and bringing his knees to his chin. When Major Myers\r\nexamined him, the leg movements were due solely “to strong periodic\r\nsimultaneous contractions of the two sartorius muscles, the rate of\r\ncontraction of which varied from 60 to 70 per minute, increasing to 90\r\nduring the excitement of examination.” There were special changes of\r\nsensibility in the right leg and arm and right side of the face and\r\nchest, not involving the abdomen. The patellar reflex was exaggerated;\r\nplantar reflexes could not be obtained. The legs were tremulous,\r\nespecially when the patient lifted them, whereas the hands and tongue\r\nwere only faintly tremulous.\r\n\r\nUnder light hypnosis, events in the amnestic period were recalled, and\r\ndetails as to the shell’s direction, process of lifting up, and fall.\r\nUnder deeper hypnosis, the sartorius contractions diminished but did\r\nnot disappear. Appropriate suggestion was made, and upon arousal from\r\nhypnosis, the movements ceased, the headache disappeared, memory was\r\nrecovered, and the unilateral disturbances of sensibility had vanished.\r\n\r\nAs to the possibility of malingering in this case, Major Myers calls\r\nattention to the disorders of sensibility which he believes could\r\nhardly have been simulated, to the persistence of spasmodic movements\r\nduring sleep, to their confinement to the sartorii, and to the spastic\r\ncondition of legs, such that when the thighs were passively raised the\r\nknees remained extended.\r\n\r\n_Re_ persistence of hysterical phenomena in sleep, Ballet felt that\r\nhe could prove that some hysterical contractures persisted during\r\nsleep, and Sollier has written a special article to the same effect.\r\nBallet’s case had a contracture developing after an operation on the\r\nfirst metacarpal bone. The contracture which followed would be then\r\nprobably, upon Babinski’s analysis, a reflex contracture and not a\r\nhysterical one. Duvernay, Sicard, and Babinski himself have noted the\r\npersistence of reflex contractures during sleep, to say nothing of\r\ntheir persistence under an advanced stage of chloroform narcosis. In\r\nfact, these reflex contractures are exactly as fixed and persistent as\r\ncontractures of clearly organic origin. It is probable that Babinski\r\nwould define Myers’ case (395) as a physiopathic one; yet against this\r\ndiagnosis would be the disappearance of the movements after hypnosis.\r\nAs against hysteria, it will be noted that the patellar reflex was\r\nexaggerated, and that the plantar reflexes could not be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Brown-Séquard syndrome, hematomyelic?\r\n\r\n=Case 396.= (BALLET, August, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 24, went to the front November 12, 1914, and June 1, 1915,\r\nhad a shell burst near him in the trench, on the occasion of which he\r\nfelt a violent shock, as if a blow in the kidneys. He felt suddenly\r\nparalyzed in both legs. He was crouching at the time of the shell\r\nburst. His legs felt dead, and he had such violent pain in the thorax\r\nas to make breathing difficult. He was carried to a shelter. After a\r\nfew hours, the left leg began to move again.\r\n\r\nHe was carried to the ambulance, remaining there five days, unable to\r\nwalk, though able to move and turn in bed, slightly constipated, with\r\npersistent pains in back. He was then carried to Auxiliary Hospital\r\n231, at Paris, and a bullet (!) was found superficially lodged in the\r\nregion of the left scapula. Neither patient nor physicians had hitherto\r\nobserved the bullet, which could have had nothing to do with any spinal\r\nlesion.\r\n\r\nThe pains, in the course of a month, grew less, and at the end of two\r\nor three weeks he began to walk and was sent to the psychoneurosis\r\nservice at Ville-Évrard, July 10. He then complained of pain in the\r\nright thorax, especially on movement or after sitting up some time. He\r\ncould hardly bring himself to the sitting posture from the bed, and\r\nfound difficulty in raising the right leg therefrom. In walking, the\r\n_right leg_ was dragged behind. The reflexes were increased on the\r\nright side. There was ankle clonus without Babinski sign. Anesthesia\r\nto touch over the whole of the _left leg_. Anesthesia to pin prick and\r\ntemperature as far as the umbilicus. Cold was not felt on the left side.\r\n\r\nThe water of a bath seemed lukewarm on the left side and warm on\r\nthe right. The left side of the scrotum and the left half of the\r\npenis showed the same disorder of sensibility. There was a zone\r\nof hypesthesia on the _right_ side of the thorax in the region of\r\nthe lower ribs. The patient compared his sensations while at rest\r\nand without contact to a sensation of painful pressure occurring\r\nintermittently, or rather in paroxysms, not advancing beyond the median\r\nline of the back. Here was a question of Brown-Séquard syndrome,\r\nprobably due to a slight hematomyelia, but associated with no external\r\nlesion or any injury to the vertebral column.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Brown-Séquard’s syndrome, see Athanassio-Benisty with respect to\r\nspinal cord symptoms associated with lesions of the brachial plexus. It\r\nappears that the combination of spinal cord and brachial plexus injury\r\nis not uncommon. Note in this case that a bullet was found in the left\r\nscapula region. According to Ballet, this bullet could have had nothing\r\nto do with a spinal lesion.\r\n\r\n\r\nViolence to back: Dysbasia. Antebellum injury.\r\n\r\n=Case 397.= (SMYLY, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man (also injured in 1906 by the fall of a heavy weight on his back)\r\nwent to France in 1914 as a soldier, and eight months later was hurled\r\ninto a shell hole so that his back struck the edge. He was rendered\r\nunconscious. Upon recovery of consciousness, the right leg was found to\r\nbe swollen, and there were severe pains in the legs and back.\r\n\r\nUpon return home the patient went from one hospital to another, for the\r\nmost part unable to walk, suffering from agonizing pain in head and\r\neyes. Insomnia and waking dreams.\r\n\r\nHe was able to bring himself to an upright position and to rush a few\r\nsteps. He has now acquired considerable control of the feet by the aid\r\nof crutches. Insomnia persisted.\r\n\r\n\r\nDysbasia: Psychogenic (cerebellar nucleus (?))\r\n\r\n=Case 398.= (CASSIRER, February, 1916.)\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 1915, a shell wounded a man slightly, and burned off some\r\nof the hair of his head. He was unconscious two days, and on waking\r\nvomited for a time. Shortly after the injury difficulties in standing\r\nand walking set in, with headache, noises in the left ear, difficulty\r\nin the intake of ideas, excitability, and poor memory. Then, slight\r\nimprovement. About the middle of June he was no longer closely confined\r\nto bed and could take a few steps with two canes; but the gait was\r\nstill unsteady and the left leg tended to make abnormal-looking\r\nmovements. There was nystagmus, rapid, though constant, on looking\r\nto the left,--more in the left eye; and nystagmus on looking to the\r\nright,--more in the right eye. Adiadochokinesis absent. Vestibular\r\nnerve somewhat excitable. Deviation outward in finger-pointing test.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cassirer, this case is one largely of psychogenic origin,\r\nwith possibly an organic cerebellar nucleus. The knee-jerks absent\r\n(even up to March 31). W. R. negative.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; unconsciousness: Dysbasia, in part hysterical, in part\r\norganic (?).\r\n\r\n=Case 399.= (HURST, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA private, 29, was knocked over by a shell explosion December, 1914. He\r\nwas unconscious two days, found that he could not move either right arm\r\nor left leg, got some power back shortly, but, if he tried to stand,\r\nexperienced involuntary violent movements in the left leg.\r\n\r\nApril 1, 1915, response to questions was slow and speech slow. The\r\nright arm and grip were weak. If the left hand was clenched, there was\r\nan associated movement of the right hand; but on clenching the right\r\nhand, no associated movement was produced in the left. The musculature\r\nwas equal on the two sides, and the tendon reflexes of the arms were\r\nbrisk and equal. Light tactile stimuli were hard to localize. Movements\r\nof the left leg were somewhat weak, though the musculature was equal on\r\nthe two sides. The knee-jerks were brisk, the left slightly brisker.\r\nSometimes a well-marked ankle clonus could be obtained on the left\r\nside, but sometimes not. The plantar reflex was constantly flexor.\r\nBabinski’s second sign (combined flexion of thigh and pelvis) was well\r\nmarked on the left side.\r\n\r\nOn attempts to walk, the left leg would move rapidly from side to side,\r\nround the point of contact of toes with ground. When a step forward\r\nwas taken with the right leg, the left one dragged, and made irregular\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThis gait seemed obviously hysterical. The patient was kept in hospital\r\nfor a month. He was very easily hypnotizable, but even in deep hypnosis\r\nleg movements could not be controlled when he was told to walk. The\r\nfirst whiff of ether hypnotized but did not cure him.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, upon review, Hurst believes that there may have been\r\norganic brain changes, which (_a_) the associated movement of the\r\nparalyzed hand when the normal hand was contracting, (_b_) the slightly\r\nincreased left knee-jerk, (_c_) tendency to ankle-clonus, and (_d_)\r\nBabinski’s second sign, may show.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeculiar walking tic.\r\n\r\n=Case 400.= (CHAVIGNY, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was found with a peculiar walking tic. He would rest a\r\ngood deal longer on the left leg than on the right. He would make a\r\nsudden movement of the right leg forward, as if on a spring. At the\r\nsame time, the man’s head would give a violent movement to the right\r\njust as the right leg was receiving the weight of the body. The idea\r\nof this movement seemed to be that the center of gravity would be\r\nshifted and the work of the right leg would be relieved. This peculiar\r\nwalk was naturally very slow. If the walk was slowed down, it became\r\nquite normal. There was no pain at the basis of this walk. If the man\r\nhopped, he hopped no more painfully on the right leg, nor with greater\r\ndifficulty, than upon the left.\r\n\r\nThis man was guilty of desertion in the face of the enemy, and of\r\ndesertion in the interior in time of war. He said he could not walk\r\nwell and that he needed to take care of himself at his mother’s house,\r\nas he was not considered sick in his regiment. He had been wounded\r\nwith two bullets, September 28, 1914, which struck him on the internal\r\naspects of the knees. He was treated in hospital from October to the\r\nend of November, 1914; was held at the dépôt of his regiment from\r\nDecember to August, 1915. He was then put in hospital a month, and\r\nreturned to his dépôt for three more months. He was examined by three\r\nphysicians in August, 1915, and the commission decided that he was fit\r\nfor service, and a simulator.\r\n\r\nThorough examination, including electrical and X-ray examinations,\r\nshowed no lesion. Chavigny observed the patient for a long time, from\r\nthe 21st of November, 1916, to January 5, 1917. Shells dropped near the\r\nhospital, December 2, and, following orders, the patients were taken\r\ninto a vaulted cellar, and they ran thither very rapidly; but this\r\npatient could not hurry. He walked slowly, with the same tic. Surely\r\nthe tic would be rather a difficult one to imagine, and a somewhat\r\nmore probable set of symptoms would ordinarily be chosen. The man has\r\nnot the unstable nature of the ordinary victim of tic. On the contrary,\r\nhe has rather the invincible obstinacy of a hysterotraumatic. On being\r\nshown that he could walk properly without these “para” movements, he\r\nwould reply, “I can’t do anything else,” and he shook his head upon\r\nbeing told that he could be cured.\r\n\r\nReëducation of his anesthetic areas (there was a zone of diminution in\r\nsensibility to pin-prick in the knee region, and a complete anesthesia\r\nof the sole of the foot, with abolition of the plantar reflex),\r\nreëducation by appropriate gymnastics, and mental reëducation, might be\r\nattempted in a special neurological hospital.\r\n\r\n_Re_ disorders of gait, Laignel-Lavastine and Courbon divide functional\r\ngait disorders into three groups: (_a_) A group called dynamogenic;\r\n(_b_) an inhibitory group; and (_c_) a group showing both forms of\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nRoussy and Lhermitte have attempted to divide the gait disorders into\r\ntwo groups: (_a_) A group termed by them basophobic, in which there is\r\na marked psychogenic and emotional basis; and (_b_) a dysbasic group,\r\nthe basis of which is suggestion rather than emotion. Following is a\r\nskeleton of their classification:\r\n\r\n1. Astasia-abasia and dysbasia group.\r\n\r\n    Astasia-abasia.\r\n    Pseudo tabetic dysbasia.\r\n    Pseudo polyneuritic dysbasia.\r\n    Tight-rope walker’s gait.\r\n    Scrubber’s gait.\r\n    Choreiform dysbasia.\r\n    Knock-kneed gait.\r\n    Walking as if on sticky surface.\r\n    Bather’s gait.\r\n\r\n2. Stasobasophobia group.\r\n\r\n3. Habit limping.\r\n\r\n\r\nMine explosion; unconsciousness: Camptocormia. Hospital rounder twenty\r\nmonths (bedfast five months) without complete neurological examination.\r\nCure by persuasive electrotherapy in one hour.\r\n\r\n=Case 401.= (MARIE, MEIGE, BÉHAGNE, February, 1917; SOUQUES and\r\nMÉGEVAND, February, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man became a hospital rounder to all points of the compass in France\r\nduring a period of twenty months, with such diagnoses as myelopathic\r\ndisorder, complex spinal trouble, ataxic phenomena.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact he was a camptocormic: trunk bent, knees\r\nsemi-flexed, legs in external rotation. He used two canes in\r\nlocomotion, made a bowing movement with each 20 cm. step, then another\r\nbowing movement, and another little step with the other foot. Made to\r\nlie down, his legs would elongate, the right completely but the left\r\nwith some difficulty, the feet going into hyperextension, with the big\r\ntoe raised, others flexed; the feet externally rotating, plantae turned\r\nin. In horizontal decubitus, there was only slight lumbar discomfort,\r\nbut the legs stiffened and gave quick convulsive jerks. Taking the\r\nposture several times in succession would diminish these phenomena.\r\nKneeling, he could bring his heels within 10 cm. of the buttock,\r\nwhereas in spontaneous flexion of the leg on the thigh, the knee\r\nremained a distance of 40 cm. from the buttock.\r\n\r\nA complete examination showed no joint disorder or any diminution in\r\nmuscular strength, or any reflex disorder except that all the tendon\r\nreflexes were rather powerful. There was a question of possible X-ray\r\ndemonstration of lesions and ankylosis of the fourth and fifth lumbar\r\nvertebrae, and there was a question of some incontinence of urine. On\r\nthe basis of these phenomena apparently, this camptocormic patient had\r\nbeen saddled with the diagnosis of myelopathic and ataxic disorder\r\nfor a period of 16 months. A neurologist was at last consulted, and\r\non his advice, it proved possible to get the patient evacuated to a\r\nneurological center in a period of four months. Facts of this species\r\nare unfortunately still too common, state Marie, Meige and Béhagne,\r\nFebruary 1, 1917, despite the remarkable and rapid cures obtained in\r\ncamptocormia by Souques. In point of fact, no complete neurological\r\nexamination had been performed upon this man during a period of 20\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThis particular patient was given to Souques for treatment (Souques and\r\nMégevand). His cure was completed by persuasive electrotherapy, in an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the man was buried in a mine explosion, June 5, 1915,\r\nlost consciousness and came to twenty hours later, able to rise and\r\ntake a few steps, but bent in two with a sharp dorsolumbar pain. The\r\npain grew more violent and generalized during the next few days, and\r\nhe began to lose all power in his legs, so that he could walk with the\r\ngreatest difficulty. He was practically bedfast for five months. He\r\nthen tried to rise and walk, but suffered so much that he could not get\r\nup except in a camptocormic position. It was in fact only January 23,\r\n1917, at the Salpêtrière, that the diagnosis of camptocormia was made.\r\nThe man complained of pains at the lower dorsal and lumbar regions\r\nof the spinal column with slight irradiation sidewise. The following\r\ndiagnoses had been made:\r\n\r\nJune 8, 1915. Severe contusion of chest and back.\r\n\r\nJuly 9, 1915. Multiple contusions, commotio spinalis; lesions and\r\nankylosis of the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae (X-ray examination).\r\n\r\nSept. 3, 1916. Lumbar intervertebral arthritis with compression of\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nNov. 4, 1916. Myelopathic disorder.\r\n\r\nDec. 5, 1916. Old complex spinal disorder.\r\n\r\nSouques remarks that these diagnoses show that knowledge about\r\ncamptocormia has not penetrated into most of the sanitary formations\r\n(1917).\r\n\r\n\r\nAstasia-Abasia.\r\n\r\n=Case 402.= (GUILLAIN and BARRÉ, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was evacuated to the 6th Army neurological center for\r\nparaplegia with tremor. He had been in various hospitals _for a period\r\nof a year_. The tendon reflexes of the arms appeared increased; there\r\nwas a suspicion of patellar clonus and of foot clonus, and it had been\r\nproposed to invalid the man for spastic paralysis. In point of fact,\r\nthe man was suffering from an epileptoid trepidation of the foot and of\r\nthe patella. When he was lying down, his motor disorders practically\r\npassed away, though they had been very marked when he tried to stand\r\nupright or to walk. He had much trouble in walking, but could readily\r\nstand for some time on one leg.\r\n\r\nThe man was forthwith treated by persuasive methods. It is important\r\nto find out the organic lesion which in all probability served as a\r\nstarting point for the functional disease, and important to remove or\r\nabolish this lesion however minute if a complete and lasting cure is to\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\n_Re_ astasia-abasia, writers have remarked that it is one of the\r\ncommonest hysterical syndromes in the war, though somewhat rare in its\r\ncomplete form. Roussy and Lhermitte state that it usually follows the\r\nexplosion of a large calibre projectile and has a rapid onset. It is\r\noften an isolated phenomenon, without emotional or other Shell-shock\r\ncomplications. The victim has been thrown to the ground and rolled into\r\na trench or hollow. Sometimes the victim gets back to the first-aid\r\npost, only to find himself on arrival at the ambulance wholly unable to\r\nwalk. The legs, however, are drawn along inertly, as in paraplegia, or\r\na pronounced contracture interferes with walking.\r\n\r\nAstasia-abasia is classified with hysteria major, hysterical\r\nhemiplegia, hysterotraumatic brachial monoplegia, glossolabial\r\nhemispasm, hysterical mutism, and rhythmic chorea, as so characteristic\r\nthat differential diagnosis is superfluous. According to Babinski,\r\nno functional spasm and no organic disease can reproduce hysterical\r\nastasia-abasia.\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple shell wounds, with persistent slight suppuration of thigh:\r\nAbdominothoracic contracture, tetanic, four months after original\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n=Case 403.= (MARIE, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 31, was wounded in the left arm January, 1915, and received\r\n10 c.c. antitetanic serum; was wounded again July 10 in the face,\r\nscalp, upper part of the thorax, left arm and left leg by shell\r\nfragments, and again received, two days later, 10 c.c. antitetanic\r\nserum. July 13, at the ophthalmological center at Rouen the left eye\r\nwas enucleated on account of a shell wound, and four days later a\r\nfragment was removed from a phlegmon of the forearm. Later a number of\r\noperations were made for blepharoplasty. The wounds all healed well\r\nexcept for an apparently insignificant, small suppuration of the thigh.\r\nNovember 10, four months after the shell wounds, while apparently in\r\nperfect health, the man began to complain of lancinating, intermittent\r\npains in the abdomen, thorax and lumbar region. With these pains was\r\nassociated a persistent abdominolumbar contracture.\r\n\r\nOn the suspicion of an abdominal form of local tetanus, chloral was\r\ngiven; but the condition grew worse. The sudden contractions spread\r\nfrom the waist to the feet, from November 20 onward, and were felt by\r\nthe patient as electric shocks. The arms were not affected. Trouble\r\nwith breathing supervened on the night of December 3. Sometimes there\r\nwere respiratory pauses for as long as 15 seconds, followed by a slight\r\npolypnea. December 6 the man presented an intense contracture of the\r\nlower part of the trunk. The slightly retracted abdominal wall was of\r\nmarbly hardness, but quite painless. Analgesic muscular rigidity took\r\nthe place of the former crises of pain. The dorsolumbar contracture was\r\nso marked as to make an appreciable hollow in the back. The patient\r\ncould pick up an object from the ground only by flexing his knees to\r\nthe maximum, as the trunk could not be flexed. There was a very slight\r\ntrismus, but he could open his mouth, drink, eat and talk without\r\ndifficulty. There was no trace of neck stiffness or of Kernig’s sign.\r\nThe tendon reflexes, normal in the arms, were exaggerated in the lower\r\nextremities, especially on the left (wounded) side. The skin reflexes\r\nwere also more marked on the left side, especially the reflex of\r\nthe tensor of the fascia lata. There was no longer any evidence of\r\nsuppuration of the wound of the left thigh, which had been dried up for\r\na fortnight. The pulse was somewhat exaggerated (92) and there was a\r\ngeneral hyperidrosis, especially of the face.\r\n\r\nForty c.c. antitetanic serum were given without reaction, and 4 grams\r\nof chloral; five days later, 30 c.c. more serum. After ten days the\r\nabdomen remained hard, though there was a trifling improvement of\r\nthe lumbar contracture. There were no longer any spasmodic crises or\r\nrespiratory disturbances. There was a slight serous exudation from the\r\nwound. X-ray showed a small shell fragment 6 cm. below the orifice of\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\nThe third injection was given December 27 to prevent mobilization of\r\nthe bacilli at operation, and on the 28th, the projectile was removed\r\nunder local anesthesia from a small, walled-off, old pus pocket, from\r\nwhich were cultivated bacillus perfringens and other organisms.\r\n\r\nDecember 31 a distinct improvement set in and January 13 there was\r\nlittle or no trace of previous disease, except that testing the plantar\r\ncutaneous reflex on the left side produced an exaggerated contraction\r\nof the tensor of the fascia lata. February 15 he was reëxamined and\r\nfound quite normal.\r\n\r\nThis case of tetanus limited to the abdominothoracic muscles (except\r\nfor a very mild contracture of the masticators) had as its locus of\r\norigin, doubtless, a wound of the thigh from which the toxin rose along\r\nbranches of the lumbar plexus to impregnate the corresponding level of\r\nthe spinal cord. Although there was no stiffness of the wounded leg,\r\nyet there was an exaggeration of the tendon reflexes thereof. The first\r\nphase of painful contractures and spasms with respiratory disorder was\r\nsucceeded by an analgesic phase of characteristically tetanic rigidity.\r\nThe nonfebrile nature of the disease and the preservation of good\r\ngeneral health are worth noting.\r\n\r\n\r\nShoulder blade unslung in knock-down by shell splinter: Hysterical (!)\r\nparalysis of arm with anesthesia. Recovery by electricity, massage, and\r\nreëducation (dislocation remaining).\r\n\r\n=Case 404.= (WALTHER, December, 1914.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was struck September 27, near Berry au Bac, by a shell\r\nfragment in the right scapular region and was thrown, according to\r\nhis story, 15 meters. Upon entrance at Val-de-Grâce, October 13, the\r\nshoulder-girdle was found intact. There was a very painful point in the\r\nspinous process of the scapula, suggesting a fracture; but the bone\r\nwas proved intact on X-ray. The scapula was very mobile, as if unslung\r\nfrom the thorax. The arm was paralyzed. On raising the arm the scapula\r\nfollowed its movements and detached itself completely from the thorax,\r\ndislocating upwards with lively pain. The fingers could be pushed under\r\nthe anterior surface of the scapula, and its internal border proved to\r\nbe entirely free of attachment. Pressure along this internal border was\r\nvery painful. It seems as if there had been a tearing of the rhomboid\r\nand serratus magnus muscles and probably a part of the latissimus\r\ndorsi under the influence of the violent shock conveyed by the shell\r\nfragment, which had pushed the scapula forward and upward without\r\ninjuring the skin.\r\n\r\nThere was also a complete paralysis of sensation. Paralysis of motion\r\nwas complete except for the extensor longus of the thumb. This motor\r\nparalysis had come on progressively three days after the accident. A\r\nradicular paralysis from an evulsion of the plexus was suspected.\r\n\r\nBabinski, however, made the diagnosis of psychic paralysis, finding the\r\nmuscles reacting perfectly to percussion. After a few electric tests\r\nwith the faradic current voluntary movements were obtained in all the\r\nmuscles of the arm and hand.\r\n\r\nTreatment was then continued by electricity, massage and reëducation,\r\nso that all movements soon regained strength. The patient can now\r\nhimself, by raising his arm, still produce his dislocation, which still\r\nprovokes a lively pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nGunshot wound of left forearm: PARALYSIS of the arm gradually\r\nINCREASING IN DEGREE and extent and associated with pains and\r\nanesthesias.\r\n\r\n=Case 405.= (OPPENHEIM, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA reservist sustained, October 2, 1914, a gunshot wound of the left\r\nforearm from a distance of about 1400 meters. He fainted, lost much\r\nblood, and was treated surgically, October 7, in hospital (at this time\r\nno complete paralysis of the arm).\r\n\r\nIn November, however, an incomplete paralysis at first developed.\r\nNovember 12, the patient was able to flex his thumb but showed some\r\nanesthesia.\r\n\r\nTransferred to nerve hospital in December, the patient said that at the\r\nfirst change of dressings, October 10, he had not been able to move his\r\narm, and said that pains and paresthesia had existed in the arm ever\r\nsince the injury. There was still some evidence of suppuration at the\r\nexit orifice of the bullet. The left arm was now completely paralyzed\r\nand atonic, and hung down in walking, without swinging. The supinator\r\nphenomenon, though present on the right side, was absent on the left.\r\nThe triceps reflex was present. The shoulder acted like a flail joint.\r\nOn passive elevation of the left arm, the deltoid seemed to contract\r\nslightly at first; later it failed to contract. Fibrillary tremor of\r\nthe left thumb.\r\n\r\nSuggestive therapy was unsuccessful. There was an anesthesia of the\r\nleft arm and the left trunk. The disorder diminished proximally,\r\nbeing most severe in the hand and the arm. The legs were normal. The\r\nelectrical irritability of the left arm was only slightly diminished.\r\nThere was a well-marked hypertrichosis of the left forearm, the skin of\r\nwhich was slightly purple and discolored. The patient himself made an\r\nattempt to burn his arm with a lighted cigar, to see if he could feel\r\nthe pain. He showed the scar but had felt nothing. The pectoralis major\r\nmuscle did not contract. If the left arm was started actively swinging,\r\nit kept on swinging inertly. The left hand showed hyperidrosis. The\r\nsmall hand muscles were emaciated but electrically normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlass wound of wrist: Differential glove anesthesias (cold to mid\r\nforearm, pain somewhat higher, touch as far as elbow).\r\n\r\n=Case 406.= (_Romner_, March, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA German soldier, 37, wounded his right wrist in the glass of a door.\r\nThe hand was put up six weeks long with very few changes of the bandage\r\non account of suppuration, and he noticed that the arm was getting\r\nweaker and weaker, that he was losing feeling in it, and that it was\r\nbeginning to sweat a good deal, so that now and then drops of sweat\r\nwould stream off. The right hand was found markedly congested and 1.5\r\ncm. larger in circumference. The fingers and hand were especially weak.\r\nThere was a marked tremor of the arm. Electric excitability normal. The\r\nsensory disorder was in glove form. Hypesthesia to touch reached the\r\nelbow, analgesia to a point three fingers’ breadth below the elbow,\r\nand anesthesia to cold to a point two fingers’ breadth still lower, a\r\nsort of stepwise dissociation of sensibility resembling what is found\r\nin spinal lesions. The case was presented as one of local traumatic\r\nhysteria.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hysterical anesthesia, the rule is that it obeys no definite rule;\r\nthat is, it may be a hemianesthesia, a segmentary, an isolated, or even\r\na pseudo-peripheral anesthesia. It is a question whether Babinski would\r\nattempt to explain Romner’s case on the basis of medical suggestion,\r\nhetero-suggestion, or autosuggestion.\r\n\r\nMyers has had a few instances in which anesthesia spread gradually, and\r\nin which analgesia increased after its onset.\r\n\r\n_Re_ reëducation of cutaneous sensations, Chavigny recommends the\r\nfaradic current in successive applications, marking the extent of the\r\nzone of anesthesia with ink upon the skin. Each time the current is\r\napplied, the inked limits of the area are lessened. By this form of\r\nsuggestion, not only does the anesthesia disappear, but very often the\r\naccompanying paralysis also.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical contracture, edema and vasomotor disorder.\r\n\r\n=Case 407.= (BALLET, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nFor some unknown reason, a soldier developed a contracture of the\r\nright upper and lower extremities at a time when a basin of water was\r\noffered to him for toilet purposes. Three days later, this contracture\r\ndisappeared in the leg but persisted in the arm at the radiocarpal\r\njoint and in the finger joints. There was also an anesthesia to touch\r\nand pain and temperature which ran up the arm to the shoulder. The\r\ntendon reflexes were normal. On the whole, there seemed to be no doubt\r\nthat the case was one of hysterical arm contracture. Associated with\r\nthis contracture was a white edema of the hand. On account of the\r\nchances of simulation, the hand was done up and sealed in such wise\r\nthat the seals would have been broken if the splint had been lifted\r\ndown during the night. The bandage was in place from June 25 to June\r\n29. Upon its removal, there was no edema, but the contracture was\r\nstill there. The arm was put up upon a cushion so that the hand would\r\ndrain to the forearm. The edema was found capable of returning when\r\nthe hand was placed below the level of the shoulder, disappearing when\r\nthe hand was raised. The contractured hand was warmer than its fellow.\r\nAccording to Ballet, we here have an anesthetic instance of contracture\r\nassociated with edema and vasomotor disorder.\r\n\r\n_Re_ edema, Babinski states that no case of hysterical edema has stood\r\nthe test of scientific critique. Sometimes a case turns out one of\r\ntuberculous synovitis. Sometimes the patient is shown artificially to\r\nhave brought about the edema. The hysterical “blue edema” of Charcot\r\nhas not been proved to exist. Some during the war have been found due\r\nto voluntary constriction. Some of these constriction edemas even\r\nbecome relatively permanent. Babinski regards the above case of Ballet,\r\nas well as cases of Lebar and of Raynaud, as not true cases. Raynaud’s\r\ncase was probably vascular.\r\n\r\n_Re_ vasomotor disorders in Ballet’s case, the Babinski school, of\r\ncourse, holds that hysteria cannot cause such disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\nHemiparesis with syringomyelic dissociation of sensations.\r\n\r\n=Case 408.= (RAVAUT, August, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA road-laborer, 42, in the 268th Infantry, had a bomb burst about\r\na meter away, March 4, 1915. Three men nearby were killed, and two\r\nwounded. The laborer himself was turned over, covered with earth, and\r\nstunned. He could hardly get up. He was carried to shelter and found\r\nparalyzed on the left side, and unable to speak.\r\n\r\nNext day, he was carried to the ambulance, and hemianesthesia was found\r\nto exist in addition to the hemiplegia. He could now speak with some\r\ndifficulty and stammered. Vision and hearing were also impaired on the\r\nleft side. Reflexes weak; no sign of wound. There was a convulsive\r\ncrisis of some sort during the day, and afterwards the man complained\r\nof a violent headache, whereupon a lumbar puncture showed a clear fluid\r\nand a marked excess of albumin by the heat test.\r\n\r\nThe following day, March 6, the patient had much improved; his\r\nhemiplegia was less marked and the arm paralysis had almost entirely\r\ndisappeared. He still stammered.\r\n\r\nUpon the next day, vision and hearing were normal, and the sensation\r\nwas practically normal. A second lumbar puncture, March 8, showed a\r\ndiminution in the amount of albumin, although it was still supernormal.\r\n\r\nMarch 9, leg contractured in extension; stammering.\r\n\r\nMarch 12, there was no evidence of disease. March 13, albumin was very\r\nslightly increased over the normal in the puncture fluid. March 16,\r\nthere was a slight trace only of weakness in the left leg. The urine\r\nwas throughout normal. The patient wrote _Bavo_ April 12, and May 7 he\r\nwas well but still felt heaviness and pulling sensations.\r\n\r\nJuly 15 it was reported at Tours that he was not yet well, presenting\r\na left-sided hemiparesis, especially in the leg, with a syringomyelic\r\ndissociation of sensations, with atrophy of the quadriceps and\r\ndiminution of reflexes on the left side. The patient had had a\r\nhematomyelia (Laignel-Lavastine).\r\n\r\n\r\nBrachial monoplegia, tetanic.\r\n\r\n=Case 409.= (ROUTIER, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier sustained a penetrating wound of the back of the thorax\r\non the left side and received an injection of antitetanic serum. A\r\nfew days later, May 18, 1915, he came on hospital service very sick,\r\nwith high temperature and marked suppuration. The next day he had an\r\nanxious facies, temperature of 40 degrees, and sharp pains in the left\r\narm. This arm May 21 was still very painful and then began to make\r\ninvoluntary movements in the shape of incessant clonic contractions.\r\nThe forearm would suddenly flex upon the upper arm, and the upper arm\r\nitself would violently push itself forward and outward. Meantime, the\r\nwrist and fingers were not involved in the contractions. The movements\r\nwere continuous, but paroxysmally increased in extent.\r\n\r\nBabinski, called in consultation, confirmed the diagnosis of an\r\nanomalous form of tetanus. Next day trismus, pleurosthotonos, and stiff\r\nneck developed. Antitetanic serum and chloral had been given from the\r\nbeginning, with morphine at night. The patient, however, died with\r\nasphyxia June 3.\r\n\r\n_Re_ brachial monoplegia, the hysterotraumatic form first observed by\r\nCharcot has an anesthesia with the shoulder of mutton distribution,\r\nslightly affecting the thorax in front and behind, in addition to the\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nParalysis of right leg: Hysterical? Organic? “Micro-organic?”\r\n\r\n=Case 410.= (VON SARBO, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Lieutenant, aged 28, lost consciousness September 6, 1914, as\r\nthe result of a shell explosion. When consciousness returned in\r\nthe hospital, he could not remember what had happened. The last he\r\nremembered was that he had been pushing forward with his troop. There\r\nhad been no psychic shock whatever. Examined September 15, he showed\r\na right-sided hemiplegia with stiffness of the right lower extremity\r\nso that it could not be even passively flexed. It was with difficulty\r\nhe could walk and he dragged his right foot. Patellar reflex could not\r\nbe elicited on the right. Oppenheim and Babinski were absent. There\r\nwas a slight nystagmus on looking to the right. Pupils normal. Tongue\r\ndeviated to the left. Speech was slow and the man had to think a little\r\nover some expressions. He could not feel touch so well on the right\r\nas on the left and this hypesthesia grew more marked distally. He was\r\ngreatly bothered because certain words did not come to him readily,\r\nespecially names.\r\n\r\nThe absence of the Babinski and Oppenheim reflexes was against an\r\norganic hypothesis and the absence of hysterical stigmata and the\r\nnon-characteristic sensory disorder, as well as the absence of any\r\npsychic shock in the history, spoke against hysteria. The hypoglossus\r\nparalysis spoke in favor of the organic nature of the disease.\r\n\r\nAccording to von Sarbo we must look for the background of so-called\r\nfunctional nervous disorders, hysteria and neurasthenia, in structural\r\nchanges of the nervous system, the changes that Charcot called\r\nmolecular. But the lesions, he believes, do not lead to a degeneration\r\nof neurons. Accordingly we get only the external form of organic\r\nparalysis without concomitant symptoms, such as Oppenheim and Babinski\r\nreflexes. Von Sarbo terms his hypothesis that of “microörganic”\r\nchanges. To prove the hysterical nature of a condition we must show\r\nfirst that the symptoms have taken their rise on a mental or moral\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock and momentary burial: Muscular weakness, followed (third\r\nday) by complete paralysis (save neck and head). Diagnostic hypotheses.\r\n\r\n=Case 411.= (LÉRI, FROMENT and MAHAR, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA big shell burst October 3, 1914, a little over 3 meters from a\r\nsoldier crouching in a shallow Saint Mihiel trench. The shell made a\r\nhole two meters in diameter and 1.5 meters deep, and covered the man\r\nwith loose earth, from which he was readily released. During the next\r\nfew days, the man found difficulty in following his comrades on short\r\nmarches (1 to 4 kilometers). He was unable to buckle on his knapsack.\r\nThe patient was himself not alarmed at his condition.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of his accident, this man, a farmer, had never had\r\nany motor trouble, nor was there any nervous disorder in any of his\r\nrelatives. He had been in several conflicts, August 24-25, September\r\n4-6, in the Argonne and in the Haute Meuse, and he had never found it\r\nhard to keep up with his comrades. In fact, once in the Haute Meuse,\r\nhe took part in an exceedingly difficult and hasty retreat, and only a\r\nweek before the shell-shock above described he had put in a very long\r\nmarch. Thus a man, perfectly normal before the shock, had fallen into a\r\ngeneral state of slight muscular paralysis.\r\n\r\nOn the third day very suddenly this paralysis became complete. The\r\nwounded man, while sitting in the trench, found that he could not stand\r\nup either with or without the use of his hands. Now, that very morning\r\nhe had marched three kilometers from his cantonment to the trench. He\r\nwas supported on the way to the relief post, hardly 200 meters away,\r\nand was then sent to the hospital at Bar-le-Duc. At this time he was so\r\nweak that he had to be fed like a child.\r\n\r\nFor a period of three weeks he lay, unable to rise or sit up. There was\r\none exception to the generalization of the paresis: the movements of\r\nthe head and neck were normal. A general muscular atrophy set in during\r\nthe three months, but gradually diminished in amount. The diagnosis of\r\nmyopathy was made, based upon the evident degree of lumbar wasting,\r\nkyphosis, the man’s attitude, gait, manner of rising, galvanotonic\r\ncontractions.\r\n\r\nThe history was, of course, rather against the diagnosis of myopathy,\r\nas well as the marked atrophy of the hands and the existence of an\r\nincomplete R. D. Moreover the fact that he improved may be regarded as\r\nrendering the diagnosis of myopathy doubtful.\r\n\r\nOther diagnoses, less likely than that of myopathy, may be\r\nconsidered,--hematomyelia, recurrent traumatic poliomyelitis affecting\r\nthe anterior horns, polyneuritis.\r\n\r\nWithout making decision as to the nature of this case, Léri proposes\r\nthe question whether there is a shell-shock myopathy and whether there\r\nis a myopathy due to gas or to hemorrhage?\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Right hemiplegia with contracture and mutism. Cure by\r\nisolation and suggestion. Question of the relation between plantar\r\nareflexia and (_a_) anesthesia (hysterical) or (_b_) contracture.\r\n\r\n=Case 412.= (DEJERINE, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA territorial infantryman, 36, of a nervous and impressionable\r\ntemperament (father alcoholic), was blown up by a bomb October 3,\r\n1914, between Bapaume and Arras. He was evacuated forthwith to the\r\nrelief post. According to his own story, he spat blood, could not talk,\r\nand felt his right side weak. He was three weeks at a hospital in\r\nPaimpol, with the diagnosis of right hemiplegia with contracture and\r\nmutism. At Guingamp, an electrical treatment was followed by a gradual\r\ndisappearance of the arm contracture.\r\n\r\nExamined by Dejerine, January 2, 1915, he was found to be a tall,\r\nstalwart man with right leg contractured in extension, foot in\r\nequinovarus, heel raised. He walked, dragging the leg, which trembled;\r\nthe trembling then extended to the rest of the body. In dorsal\r\ndecubitus, the leg lay in adduction and internal rotation. He could\r\nlift the leg only 5 cm. above the bed, could only slightly flex leg on\r\nthigh, and could not at all flex thigh on hip. The leg could not be\r\nbent at all if he was requested to hold it stiff. Ankle joint movements\r\nwere impossible from contracture. The equinovarus was in contracture\r\nwhich could not be corrected. Right hip movements were limited and\r\npainful. Muscular atrophy absent.\r\n\r\nWhereas on the left side plantar stimulation produced not only the\r\nnormal flexor reflex but also the classical defense movements of\r\nflexion of leg on thigh and thigh on hip,--on the right side neither\r\na needle nor a match, nor any other form of stimulation of the sole,\r\nproduced any kind of reaction on the part of the toes, the fascia\r\nlata, or any leg muscles. Tested every day for some weeks, the result\r\nwas always the same. The cremasteric reflex was weak on the affected\r\nside. Abolition of the plantar reflex and of the defense movements\r\non the right side was associated with an anesthesia and a hypesthesia\r\nof the right side of the body, involving complete anesthesia below\r\nthe knee and hypesthesia of superficial and deep sensation above the\r\nknee. The buccal and lingual mucous membranes were also hypesthetic.\r\nThe bony sensibility was lost in the foot and lower leg, and was\r\ndiminished in all of the bones of the right side of the body. There\r\nwas no contraction of the visual fields. The right corneal reflex was\r\ndiminished. There were no other sensory defects.\r\n\r\nThe man was also aphonic, being unable to utter a word or a sound\r\nexcept a jerky whistling sound like the letting off of steam. He was\r\nable to write out his history intelligently. He was very emotional,\r\nwept, and trembled all over when talking of wife and children. The\r\nspinal puncture fluid was in all respects normal. A laryngoscopic\r\nexamination showed that the vocal cords were functioning normally. The\r\nlong _a_ could be pronounced distinctly, at the expense of great effort\r\nso that the larynx would finally be blocked. The laryngeal reflex was\r\nabolished. The laryngeal mucosa could be touched with a probe without\r\nproducing the slightest pain or coughing reflex. By way of treatment,\r\nthis case of hysterotraumatism was given isolation and psychotherapy\r\nfor two months without effect. But about the middle of March he began\r\nto get better, the symptoms rapidly faded, cure was effected at the end\r\nof March, and the man was evacuated to his dépôt.\r\n\r\n_Re_ reflexes and contracture, see the views of Babinski reproduced\r\nunder Case 385 of Paulian.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Tic VERSUS spasm.\r\n\r\n=Case 413.= (MEIGE, July, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was bowled over in a trench by a big shell that burst nearby.\r\nHe lost consciousness and was carried to the ambulance. But he came to,\r\nand was so absolutely well with a few hours’ rest that he took part in\r\na lively attack shortly thereafter and got a wound in the left arm,\r\naffecting slightly the ulnar nerve. He was sent to the Salpêtrière for\r\nthis ulnar nerve affection, when certain movements of his scalp were\r\nincidentally noted.\r\n\r\nThe scalp movements were quick, affecting the fronto-occipitalis\r\nmuscles as well as the auricular muscles. The displacement was from\r\nbehind forward, and then from before backward, with slight oscillations\r\nof the ear; and at the same time, the forehead wrinkled or became\r\nsmooth. The movement was involuntary and more convulsive than the\r\nsomewhat similar movements that many persons can execute with scalp\r\nand ears. The phenomenon appeared after the shock for the first time.\r\nHe had not noticed it himself but the physician at the ambulance had\r\ncalled his attention to it. The soldier was not disturbed by the\r\nmatter, either at that time or later.\r\n\r\nThe diagnostician would consider, on the one hand, tic, and on the\r\nother, spasm. According to Meige, the man was a victim of tic. No\r\ncase of such limited spasm appears to have been observed previously.\r\nHowever, the sudden development of these movements without previous\r\nhistory of tic renders the diagnosis somewhat doubtful. There was also\r\na complete anesthesia to pin-prick in the present case over the whole\r\nright side of the scalp, face, and neck, even passing below to involve\r\nthe chest, shoulder, back, and upper part of the right arm, with\r\nhypesthesia decreasing toward the nipple and the elbow. The soldier\r\nwas quite ignorant of this sensory disorder and had never before been\r\nexamined for sensations. The examination was made with due precautions\r\nto avoid suggestion. The question of anastomosis between the facial\r\nnerve and the auriculo-temporal branch of the trigeminus and the\r\nauricular branch of the cervical plexus, and of their relations to the\r\nanesthesia and tic of this case, is raised.\r\n\r\n_Re_ pathological movements such as tremors, tics, and choreiform\r\nmovements, Roussy and Lhermitte divide the tremors (see also under Case\r\n337) into typical and atypical.\r\n\r\nThe atypical ones are either limited, or more usually generalized\r\nwhen they are merely parts of the Shell-shock syndrome. Sometimes the\r\ntremors are paroxysmal, aggravated by noises. Now and then, a condition\r\nof tremophobia appears (see Case 225). As for the typical tremors, see\r\nclassifications under Case 337.\r\n\r\n_Re_ tics, the tonic or postural tic is, according to Roussy and\r\nLhermitte, much less common than clonic or spasmodic movements,\r\nwhich are Shell-shock phenomena like tremors and usually yield to\r\npsychotherapy if treated early. These tics are usually observed in and\r\nabout the head, involving the sternomastoid, trapezius, and platysma\r\nmuscles to produce clonic contractions of the neck. Other tics involve\r\ncoarser head movements, nodding, eyelid and facial spasms, bilateral\r\nor unilateral, and shoulder movements. Babinski has suggested that\r\nsome of the tremors are possibly due to organic disease, in view of\r\nthe fact that they are not readily influenced by psychotherapy. Meige\r\nhas suggested that some of the tics may also be in some sense organic.\r\nAs for the differential diagnosis of tremor and tic, according to\r\nRoussy and Lhermitte, the Shell-shock onset may be an indicator. The\r\nnon-rhythmic and irregular nature of the tic movements, and their\r\nexaggeration on voluntary movement, may be of some importance. Most\r\nof the tremors appear to be attended by a certain degree of permanent\r\ncontraction of the muscle groups concerned. Tremors cease when these\r\ncontractions disappear.\r\n\r\nA point in treatment is that complete muscular relaxation should be\r\nobtained by having the patient open his mouth and breathe deeply.\r\n\r\n_Re_ diagnosis of neurasthenia in this case, it may be inquired whether\r\nthe term is properly used, and whether there is not some confusion\r\nhere betwixt neurasthenia and hysteria.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hyperalgesia, Myers states that about 25 per cent of his\r\nShell-shock cases have shown a variety of disorders of the skin\r\nsense. Hyperesthesia and over-reaction is one phenomenon in the list,\r\nbut is far less common than hyperesthesia. According to Myers, the\r\nhyperesthesia was more relative than absolute, and was probably due to\r\nincreased affective response.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; unconsciousness: Tremors, anesthesias. Recovery by\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n=Case 414.= (MOTT, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAugust, 1915, between Ypres and Flamentières, a Jack Johnson exploded\r\none day about three o’clock in the morning near an experienced gunner,\r\nwho had been on service in the R. F. A. for 15 years, and in France\r\nduring the present war 10 months. He came to in the military hospital\r\nat Chatham, two weeks later, and was told he was lucky to be there\r\nat all as the shell had killed many comrades. He was transferred to\r\nColchester, and thence to the Fourth London General Hospital.\r\n\r\nSitting in a chair, the man showed continuous rhythmic movements of\r\nlegs, hands, and jaw, exaggerated when he was spoken to. The tremor\r\nwas almost a clonic spasm. Every now and then, the patient would start\r\nand look sidewise and upwards, as if a shell were about to drop.\r\nHyperacusis was such that the firing of the guns as far off as Woolwich\r\nalarmed him. In telling his story, he would repeat the same words over\r\nand over. He dreamt of shells bursting. His sleep was disturbed with\r\ngroaning and moaning. The face was flushed, and the palms sweating.\r\nBecause of the constant tremor, he could not stand or walk without\r\nassistance, and it was difficult to test reflexes. The tremor somewhat\r\nresembled the intention tremor of multiple sclerosis. He was unable\r\nto feel the prick of the needle on legs, left arm, or hand. He could\r\nnot feel vibrations of the tuning-fork on feet, legs, or hands, though\r\nhe could on the forehead. The fork was heard quite well six inches\r\nfrom the ears. There was some difficulty in recognizing colors. Bitter\r\nfluids could be tasted, but vinegar, salt, and various fluids, could\r\nnot be recognized. He could not recognize tincture of assafetida, attar\r\nof roses, or oil of cloves, though nitrite of amyl, ammonia and glacial\r\nacetic acid were recognized.\r\n\r\nMajor Mott felt that, though this prolonged severe disease in a\r\nlong-service man might possibly be related to some organic change in\r\nthe brain, he might well treat him by suggestion. Major Mott told him\r\nthat the careful examination just made showed that there was no organic\r\ndisease, and made it certain that he would recover. In a fortnight,\r\nhe sat in a chair without tremors and with a profound belief in Major\r\nMott.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysteria as appendix to traumata.\r\n\r\n=Case 415.= (MACCURDY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private, 25, something of a liar and of rather a low personality, had\r\nenlisted in the regular army in 1911, but deserted to become a football\r\nplayer. He reënlisted, and went to France in September, 1914, enjoying\r\nthe first six months. He broke his ankles by falling into a deep\r\ndug-out, and got frost-bite. After three or four months in England, he\r\nfound that he did not wish to go back to France. He was two months in\r\nbarracks, and then went up the line in a good deal of a panic. Soon\r\nafter, he was wounded in the thigh and was able to remain in hospital\r\na fortnight, exposed, however, to shell-fire and given to starting at\r\nnoise and occasional war dreams. Sent to his base, he remained jumpy\r\nand was now permanently afraid of the line. After three weeks in the\r\ntrenches, he again got wounds, spent five months in England, came back\r\nto France in May, and fought till September, 1916. He tried to convince\r\nthe medical officer that he had appendicitis and trench fever.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of September he saw with horror a man crushed by a\r\ntank, and thereafter was markedly affected by the sight of blood.\r\nAnother slight wound sent him to a rest camp for two weeks, whence\r\nhe was again thrown into the line, suffering acutely from fear and\r\nhorror of blood. In three days he fractured his left collarbone and\r\nwrist. He gave a pint and a half of blood for transfusion purposes,\r\nand in turn was shipped to England. On removal of the splint, he\r\nfound “probably not without satisfaction” that the arm was paralyzed.\r\nIt remained paralyzed for five months, until treatment in a special\r\nhospital eventually cured the arm; but upon cure of the arm, nightmares\r\ndeveloped,--an indication, according to MacCurdy, of the strong\r\nresistance he felt to the idea of returning to the front.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurasthenic hyperalgesia after peripheral nerve injury.\r\n\r\n=Case 416.= (WEYGANDT, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA German volunteer, a sportsman, was under heavy shell fire after the\r\nmiddle of October, 1914, and was wounded in the upper arm in November,\r\nwith an injury to the median nerve that occasioned severe pain.\r\nThese strictly localized pains increased upon any sort of physical\r\nor mental strain. If he walked down steps he kept thinking he might\r\nhave an accident, and then the pains set in with greater force. He\r\nbecame apathetic so that he did not eat, drink or urinate. If his head\r\nwere touched he felt pain as if from an electric shock. He also felt\r\nthe pain when he saw anybody approaching a door to close it, through\r\napprehension of the noise. Meantime, the wound was well healed. The\r\npulse was accelerated. The visual fields were only slightly contracted.\r\nThe patient wanted to get well and go back to the service.\r\n\r\nWeygandt regards this hyperalgesia after peripheral nerve injuries as\r\nneurasthenic.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary training: Peripheral neuritis in lead workers.\r\n\r\n=Case 417.= (SHUFFLEBOTHAM, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAmong fourteen cases of lead poisoning, members of the territorial\r\nforces, largely from North Staffordshire, was a patient suffering from\r\nperipheral neuritis. He had been in the dipping-house. Two years before\r\ngoing into the service he had been suspended for lead poisoning by the\r\nfactory surgeon. Giving up his work at the pottery, he became a general\r\nlaborer in a non-lead process factory.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after enlistment, the man began to complain of pains,\r\ntenderness in the arms, weakness of the wrists, headache, giddiness,\r\nnausea, and constipation. The bowels were opened by a large dose of\r\nepsom salts. On blood examination the hemoglobin was found diminished\r\n40 per cent; cells with basophilic granules were found to the number\r\nof 500 per cu. mm. The face was characteristically pasty. There was\r\nalbuminuria. Alcohol could be excluded. The man had to be discharged.\r\n\r\nAll Shufflebotham’s cases occurred from three to seven weeks after\r\nmobilization, nor have any cases ever been reported in territorials\r\nafter their annual training. Constipation was invariable. In two cases\r\nreturned to service, there was a recurrent attack. An epidemic could be\r\nexcluded. Shufflebotham suggests that the altered conditions of life,\r\nespecially the marching and drilling, caused increased metabolism,\r\nsetting free lead compounds from the muscles and organs of the body. It\r\nis true that a glost placer always works very hard with his muscles,\r\nbut not with the muscles used by the soldier.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Peripheral neuritis” cured by faradism.\r\n\r\n=Case 418.= (CARGILL, February, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA Naval Service man, 20, was thought to have peripheral neuritis. A\r\nlong history of pain and numbness in arms and legs, a well-marked\r\nanalgesia and anesthesia over the anterior aspects of forearms and\r\nlegs, and an anesthetic band across the front of the chest, seemed\r\nconsistent with the diagnosis. The calf muscles tightly squeezed\r\nyielded no pain. Pins could be thrust without pain into the anesthetic\r\nareas. When told to say _yes_ when the pin was felt, and _no_ when it\r\nwas not felt, the man persistently said _no_ when the areas noted above\r\nwere touched. The deep reflexes were normal. Faradism by wire brush\r\nat two sittings yielded a complete cure. It seems that once this man,\r\nafter seeing his sister fall in a fit on returning from a funeral,\r\nretired to the garden and had a similar fit himself.\r\n\r\nCargill found in 1052 sailors fifteen cases of total absence of one or\r\nboth ankle-jerks; seven of the fifteen were probably cases of tabes.\r\n\r\n_Re_ peripheral neuritis and hysteria (see under Case 387).\r\n\r\n_Re_ differential diagnosis between peripheral neuritis and reflex\r\n(physiopathic) paralysis, Babinski and Froment offer the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n       _Peripheral Neuritis._                  _Reflex Paralysis\r\n                                               and Contracture._\r\n\r\n  1. Motor disorder, degenerative          1. More or less segmentary\r\n     amyotrophy, and sensory disorder         topography.\r\n     corresponding topographically to\r\n     anatomical distribution of nerve\r\n     (neuritic) topography.\r\n\r\n  2. Amyotrophy very pronounced,           2.

Dysentery.\r\nRecovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 419.= (BOUQUET, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier invalided for endocarditis July 8, 1908, went back to the\r\ncolors on his own request August 8, 1914. He was wounded at noon\r\nSeptember 6, 1914, in the attack at Abbaye Woods. He lay in the woods,\r\nwith several comrades as badly wounded as himself, until September 10,\r\neating berries and drinking rain water. He had five wounds in all; in\r\nleft lower leg, thigh, left external malleolus, right calf, and left\r\nforearm. Moreover, he had dysentery.\r\n\r\nHe was picked up by the Germans September 10 and carried by them\r\nto the ambulance at Saint André, where he was given belated first\r\ndressing. When the enemy retreated September 12 he was left behind and\r\nfinally carried back September 13 into the French lines by a French\r\nphysician who had been a prisoner likewise. A second dressing was given\r\nSeptember 14 at Rambluzin. He was then carried in a sanitary train to\r\nBar-sur-Aube, where, September 15, injection of antitetanic serum was\r\ngiven. He left Bar-sur-Aube on December 18, 1914, practically cured,\r\nthough one of the wounds still needed care. The dysentery was still\r\npresent and walking was difficult. He was then cared for at Auxiliary\r\nHospital No. 102 in Paris.\r\n\r\nIt seems that about six weeks after his entrance in the hospital at\r\nBar-sur-Aube he had had some difficulty in opening his jaws, with acute\r\npains at the temporomaxillary joint. Similar pains appeared a few days\r\nlater in the neck, with a sensation of stiffening. The jaws still\r\nopened easily enough December 18, yet the man got pains in his jaws as\r\nsoon as he began to speak. The pain and contracture in the neck region\r\nwere sharp and permanent. Sometimes the contracture got more marked,\r\nand the board-like muscles could be felt stiffening under the examining\r\nfinger. During such crises the patient had to lie or sit down.\r\nSometimes the pains descended below the shoulders along the vertebral\r\ncolumn. The crises occurred more often in the night, in bed.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of late tetanus was made, and alcohol rubs were given.\r\nThe phenomena gradually disappeared. The dysentery also had not yielded\r\nto therapeutics until eight or ten days before the patient left the\r\nhospital. There was still, at the time of report, a certain difficulty\r\nin walking, with a tendency to use the external border of the left foot\r\nrather than the sole.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Spasmodic neurosis and neurasthenia. Treatment without\r\ngreat success.\r\n\r\n=Case 420.= (OPPENHEIM, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAugust 19, 1914, a shell exploded very close to a soldier, whose\r\nbread bag, cartridge container, and field flask were pulled away from\r\nhim, but who was not himself wounded. He fell down. Shortly developed\r\nheadache, vertigo, palpitation. In running he fell down repeatedly.\r\nSpasms soon appeared in the legs. He had previously suffered from\r\ngastric disturbances, and heavy food did not agree with him.\r\n\r\nAt the time of admission to hospital he complained of great\r\nirritability, nervous twitching, formication in his limbs, war dreams,\r\ntachycardia. The heart boundaries were normal. The muscles of lower\r\nextremities were attacked by tonic spasms, and felt board-like.\r\nThis tonic spasm occurred on each attempt at motion, very gradually\r\ndisappearing when at rest. Passive movements also had the same effect.\r\nFibrillary tremor affected the left quadriceps. On each attempt at\r\nmotion, pains were felt in the legs. At first the cramps were so severe\r\nthat all locomotion or even standing was impossible.\r\n\r\nTreatment: Cold-water pack (Priessnitz), hyoscin injections, magnesium\r\nsulphate injections (5 to 10 c.c. of ten per cent solution), perineural\r\ninjections, lumbar spinal analgesia,--all without success. Fibrillary\r\ntremors persisted in the quadriceps and in the extensors of the toes.\r\nThe tonic spasms on increased attempts at motion became combined\r\nwith clonic twitchings. From the end of November on the patient made\r\nattempts to walk with straddling legs, and under considerable vibratory\r\ntremor.

(_b_) Refrigeration:\r\nCombination of hysterical paraplegia and reflex (physiopathic)\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\n=Case 421.= (BABINSKI, 1916.)\r\n\r\nThe forearm of a soldier was pierced in its lower part by a bullet,\r\nwhich produced no lesion of large nerve trunks or blood vessels. A\r\ncomplete brachial monoplegia followed. Every movement of the different\r\nsegments of the arm was abolished. The hand and forearm were slightly\r\natrophied, and were of a reddish salmon color. The temperature of the\r\naffected hand and forearm was about three or four degrees lower than\r\nthat on the other side. The sphygmometric oscillations of the forearm\r\nwere twice as small in the paralyzed limb as in the healthy limb,\r\nbut the systolic blood pressure was normal. There was a mechanical\r\nover-excitability of the muscles, and a slight exaggeration of the bone\r\nand tendon reflexes. The paralysis was in part of reflex (physiopathic)\r\nnature. On account however, of the completeness of the monoplegia, and\r\nthe fact that the reflex paralyses as a rule affect only the distal\r\nportion of the limb, the diagnosis of hysteria had to be made in\r\naddition to the diagnosis of reflex disorder.\r\n\r\nAs a result of freezing, this patient had also a complete crural\r\nparaplegia. He showed vasomotor disorders and hypothermia of both feet,\r\ntogether with mechanical over-excitability of the muscles; and these\r\nlatter disorders appeared to be of a reflex nature. The paraplegia,\r\nhowever, was of a hysterical nature.\r\n\r\n_Re_ refrigeration, see Case 309 (Binswanger) of glossolabial spasm.\r\n\r\nDifferential diagnosis of organic (central) monoplegia and reflex\r\n(physiopathic) contracture and paralysis.

A case “non-organic” in the ordinary sense and\r\nnon-hysterical, _i.e._, reflex or physiopathic.\r\n\r\n=Case 422.= (BABINSKI and FROMENT, 1917.)\r\n\r\nStruck by his observations upon the persistence of tendon reflexes\r\nin narcosis in a wounded soldier, Babinski continued observations in\r\nthe same general direction in a case which may be termed briefly one\r\nof hypotonia of the extensors of the hand following the passage of a\r\nbullet through the arm without nerve trunk lesion.\r\n\r\nThis patient had flaccid paralysis of hand and fingers following\r\nwound in second dorsal interosseous space and vasomotor disorder and\r\nlocal hypothermia in the hand. There was a slight diffuse atrophy\r\nof the muscles of the hand, forearm, and arm; but this atrophy was\r\nnot systematized, and there was no R. D. The tendon reflexes of the\r\nextremity were preserved. There were no signs of organic disease of the\r\ncentral or peripheral nervous system; that is, in the ordinary sense of\r\nthese terms.\r\n\r\nWas it a question of hysteria or of simulation?\r\n\r\nBabinski was struck by the following symptoms:\r\n\r\nFirst, the remarkably intense hypotonia, especially noteworthy in the\r\nthumb, a hypotonia quite equal if not superior to that observed in\r\nparalysis following marked nerve lesions;\r\n\r\nSecond, mechanical over-excitability of high degree in the muscles of\r\nthe hand and forearm, with retardation of the muscular response; and\r\n\r\nThird, electric over-excitability of the muscles, with what Babinski\r\ncalls “anticipated fusion” of the faradic reactions.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this patient had been wounded in September, 1914,\r\nand that the paralysis had developed five months later. Before the\r\ndevelopment of this paralysis, there had been simply a meiopragic state.\r\n\r\nWithout perforating the hand, the bullet had remained in the wound,\r\nbeing excised therefrom three months after the trauma.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1916,--that is, some sixteen months after the injury and\r\neleven months after the recovery of the paralysis,--the vasomotor\r\ndisorder and the hypothermia, and the faradic, voltaic and mechanical\r\nover-excitability of the hand and forearm muscles, were in evidence.\r\nHypotonia was marked, permitting an overflexion of the hand upon the\r\nforearm. If the patient moved his forearm, the affected hand would hang\r\nand oscillate inertly; likewise in walking, seeming to obey only the\r\nlaws of physics.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1916, the patient was invalided and found to be still in\r\npossession of the above-mentioned signs. Similar phenomena have been\r\nfound in the _main figée_ acrocontracture, and _main d’accoucheur_,\r\nand belong, in the opinion of Babinski, to a group which is neither\r\nhysterical nor organic in the ordinary sense of the terms. Vasomotor\r\nand thermic phenomena are in the foreground of the picture, and are, in\r\nfact, practically constant, though they vary somewhat in degree. They\r\nreact abnormally to the temperature of the surrounding medium; there is\r\nundoubtedly a local perturbation of the vasomotor and heat-regulating\r\nmechanism. There is also certain evidence of vascular spasm. The\r\nvasomotor and thermic disorders run parallel with the mechanical\r\nover-excitability of the muscles and the slowness of the response.\r\n\r\n\r\nChloroform to demonstrate asymmetry of reflexes.\r\n\r\n=Case 423.= (BABINSKI and FROMENT, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 26, sustained, September 22, 1914, a bullet injury of the\r\nright calf. There was no fracture, as X-ray showed, but healing was\r\nslow, taking no less than three months. The right knee-jerk was a\r\nlittle stronger and a little sharper than the left, but the difference\r\nwas controversial; and the difference between the two Achilles reflexes\r\nwas still more doubtful.\r\n\r\nChloroformed October 10, 1915: As the patient was going to sleep, even\r\nbefore the phase of excitation and motor agitation had passed, the two\r\nknee-jerks and left Achilles jerk had disappeared. They grew rapidly\r\nless marked before disappearing, and none of the tendon reflexes\r\npresented any phase of exaggeration while the patient was going under.\r\nAt this point anesthesia was arrested. The right Achilles reflex,\r\nwhich had not disappeared, was sharply defined. It was even stronger\r\nthan in the normal state and polykinetic. During the whole phase\r\nof awaking from the chloroform, the right Achilles reflex remained\r\nstrong and polykinetic, without, however, any ankle clonus. Thus, the\r\ndifference between the two Achilles reflexes became indisputable; also\r\nthe right knee-jerk reappeared before the left, and became stronger\r\nwithout any patellar clonus. At this time, the difference between the\r\ntwo knee-jerks was sharp and beyond cavil. This status, in which the\r\nknee-jerk and Achilles reflexes were asymmetrical, lasted about ten\r\nminutes after anesthesia ceased and lasted a little longer for the\r\nknee-jerks than for the Achilles jerks.\r\n\r\n\r\nReflexes under chloroform.\r\n\r\n=Case 424.= (BABINSKI and FROMENT, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier sustained a clean-cut wound of the supero-external aspect\r\nof the right thigh without much destruction of tissue or any adherent\r\nscar. He showed marked lameness, September 15, 1915, walking with\r\nhis right leg extended and the foot in external rotation. There was\r\na slight limitation of the movements of the hip joint in respect\r\nto internal rotation and flexion of thigh. The right knee-jerk\r\nwas a little stronger than the left, and this condition persisted\r\nseveral days. After a few tests, the knee-jerk became even slightly\r\npolykinetic. The Achilles jerks were normal and equal. There was no\r\nepileptoid trepidation of the foot, and no patella clonus. There was\r\na slight hypothermia of right leg, with ill-defined muscular atrophy.\r\nWalking caused pain.\r\n\r\nChloroform anesthesia, September 20, 1915, yielded an exaggeration of\r\nthe knee-jerks with a suggestion of patella clonus even before the\r\nphase in anesthesia of motor excitation had set in. As anesthesia\r\nproceeded the exaggeration was rapidly lost on the left side but\r\nprogressively increased on the right. In the phase of complete muscular\r\nresolution, when all the other tendon reflexes (such as the knee-jerk,\r\nAchilles jerk on the left side, the radial and olecranon reflexes on\r\nthe left side) were abolished, the patella clonus on the right side was\r\nperfectly distinct and could be elicited either by the usual method or\r\nby raising the thigh and letting it fall. On percussion of the patella\r\ntendon, a strong polykinetic reflex was obtained; right Achilles jerk\r\npreserved; right leg in external rotation. Internal rotation could be\r\npassively performed better than in the waking state, but this movement\r\nwas still limited. As the man was waking from anesthesia, when reflexes\r\nwere reappearing, there was a suggestion of left patella clonus--right\r\nclonus as strong as before. At no time any trepidation of the foot. The\r\npatella clonus on the right side lasted an hour after waking, at which\r\ntime all the reflexes returned to their previous state.\r\n\r\n\r\nReflexes under chloroform.\r\n\r\n=Case 425.= (BABINSKI and FROMENT, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier sustained a bullet wound, September 22, 1914, in the right\r\ncalf. There was no fracture, as X-ray showed. Cicatrization was slow\r\nand took at least three months. He was examined October 2, 1915, at\r\nthe Pitié,--not complaining of pains, but lame. There were no pains,\r\nlimitation of movement, or joint sounds in the hip joint, and X-ray\r\nwas negative. There was a slight atrophy of the limb, 1.5 c.m. less\r\nin circumference on the right. There was a sharply defined local\r\nhypothermia of the right leg up to the knee. The right knee-jerk was a\r\nlittle stronger and brisker than the left, yet it was difficult to be\r\nsure of this, and there was a still more doubtful difference between\r\nthe Achilles reflexes.\r\n\r\nThe man was anesthetized with chloroform, October 10. As he was going\r\nto sleep, before the phase of excitement and agitation had ceased, the\r\ntwo knee-jerks had disappeared. At the same time, the left Achilles\r\njerk vanished, followed by the plantar cutaneous reflexes. Anesthesia\r\nwas then stopped. The right Achilles jerk, which had not disappeared\r\nat any time, remained distinct. It was stronger than in the waking\r\nstate, and polykinetic. During the waking phase, this reflex remained\r\nstrong and polykinetic, but there was no epileptoid trepidation of\r\nthe foot. Accordingly, under chloroform, the difference of the two\r\nAchilles reflexes had become very sharp. The right knee-jerk reappeared\r\nbefore the left and became stronger, though without patella clonus.\r\nThis difference was much more striking than in the waking state. This\r\nasymmetry of the patella and Achilles reflexes lasted about 10 minutes\r\nafter anesthesia was stopped, and lasted a little longer for the\r\npatella reflexes than for the Achilles reflexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nShrapnel wound above clavicle: Brachial monoplegia, partly hysterical,\r\npartly organic.\r\n\r\n=Case 426.= (BABINSKI and FROMENT, 1916.)\r\n\r\nBabinski speaks of certain symptomatic incompatibilities which emerged\r\nin the study of cases of combinations of hysteria, organic nervous\r\ndisease, and the so-called physiopathic disorders. An example of\r\nsuch an incompatibility might be that of a patient who should, three\r\nmonths after a sudden hemiplegia, show complete or almost complete\r\nflaccid paralysis and but slight exaggeration of tendon reflexes--yet\r\nthe Babinski reflex. Of course, the Babinski reflex would permit a\r\ndiagnosis of pyramidal tract disease. Yet a sudden intense hemiplegia\r\nlasting three months, if it were merely a matter of pyramidal tract\r\ndisorder, ought to show hyperreflexia of a pronounced degree as well as\r\ncontracture. An example from the arm is as follows:\r\n\r\nA soldier got a shrapnel wound in the left supraclavicular region,\r\nand had a complete paralysis of the arm, which had lasted more than a\r\nmonth. Electrical examination showed marked reaction of degeneration\r\nin the muscles controlled by the musculo-cutaneous nerve, as well as\r\na diminution of electrical excitability in the muscles innervated by\r\nradial branches. On the contrary, in the circumflex territory, ulnar\r\nand median, electrical excitability was normal. There were no vasomotor\r\ndisorders. The diagnosis of an association of hysteria and organic\r\ndisease was made. Babinski affirmed that electrification would effect a\r\npartial cure; and in point of fact, the patient, after having submitted\r\nto the current for several minutes, was able to use all the muscles\r\nwhose faradic contractility was normal or almost normal. Thus, he could\r\nraise his arm, flex the thumb, flex the fingers, close the hand, and\r\nextend the hand and fingers. Flexion of the forearm on the arm was\r\nstill difficult, since there was, in fact, a reaction of degeneration\r\nin the muscles of the anterior region of the arm. The fact that the\r\nmovements could be partially executed was dependent upon action of the\r\nsupinator longus.\r\n\r\n\r\nGunshot fracture of upper arm; recovery with motor power in five weeks:\r\nSix weeks later, Erb’s palsy (plus). Hypothesis: “Reflex paralysis”\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\n=Case 427.= (OPPENHEIM, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA reservist, 26, was shot through the middle of the left upper arm,\r\nsustaining an oblique fracture of the humerus, August 26. The external\r\nwounds healed in a month; the fracture somewhat later. The left arm\r\nwas at first stiff and motionless, but in five weeks it could again be\r\nmoved. Pains disappeared with return of motility.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of November the arm began to lose power to move again,\r\nespecially the muscles of the upper arm. November 20, the patient\r\nshowed atrophic paralysis (left deltoid, biceps, brachialis internus,\r\nand supinator longus) suggesting at first glance the appearance of\r\nan Erb’s palsy; but the triceps and the adductor of the upper arm\r\nwere also unable to move and there was a slight paresis in the distal\r\nmuscles of the extremity. There were no pains or other objective\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of subacute poliomyelitis was considered. Electric\r\nexcitability, however, was found to be normal, both faradically and\r\ngalvanically.\r\n\r\nWhen patient walked, the left arm swung helpless without sign of\r\ninnervation or any tonus. Abduction of the shoulder could also not be\r\nperformed, though a slight flexion of the forearm shortly began to be\r\ndemonstrable. If the patient inclined his head to the right, extended\r\nhis hand at the wrist, and flexed the fingers forcibly, he could then\r\nflex the forearm somewhat, and a slight tension of the biceps and\r\nsupinator longus developed. Sometimes fibrillary tremors developed in\r\ndeltoid and biceps.\r\n\r\nOf course a transient peripheral palsy can be produced by pressure of\r\nthe radial nerve without any change of electrical excitability, but\r\nsuch a change is not associated with atrophy.\r\n\r\nNeuritis and poliomyelitis producing an Erb’s palsy without any effect\r\nupon the electrical reactions is an hypothesis not to be entertained.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the hypothesis of psychogenic or hysterical palsy may\r\nbe set up. Yet an atonic atrophic palsy with loss of tendon reflexes\r\n(supinator) is inappropriate. According to Oppenheim, this case falls\r\ninto the category of the arthrogenic atrophies. A simple muscular\r\natrophy may follow disease of joints and bones. However, such cases\r\nhave rarely shown a complete palsy, as in Oppenheim’s case.\r\n\r\nIn short, we return to the old doctrine of reflex paralysis, conceiving\r\nthat a stimulus passing from the periphery influences the gray matter\r\nin its trophic functions.\r\n\r\nHow much effect had the psyche upon this condition? The patient had\r\nstuttered from childhood and had sustained a fracture of the skull at\r\n9, following which his school work, especially mental arithmetic, had\r\nbeen poor. The lack of psychic inhibitions may play some part in the\r\nsituation, but on the whole, the reflex hypothesis is preferred by\r\nOppenheim, the nerve conceived to be dynamically affected, the muscles\r\norganically.\r\n\r\n\r\nParalysis: Hysterical? organic?\r\n\r\n=Case 428.= (GOUGEROT and CHARPENTIER, May, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 20, was wounded May 15, 1915, by a large number of shell\r\nfragments, 15 of which struck the right leg, two producing serious\r\ninjuries,--the one, a penetrating wound of the popliteal space followed\r\nby stiffness of the knee, later cured by extraction of the fragments;\r\nthe other, causing a deep wound at the internal malleolus. The fragment\r\nwas extracted June 3, but osteomyelitis persisted and a fistulous\r\ncontraction was developed in January, 1916. There was a slight equinism.\r\n\r\nBy contrast with these deep bony lesions of the right leg, on the left\r\nside a fragment had struck the dorsum of the left foot at about its\r\nmiddle point, along the extensors of the fourth and fifth toes. The\r\nfragment was removed toward the end of June, 1915. The wound closed in\r\na fortnight, leaving a loose 20 mm. scar. The man complained of pains,\r\nwhich he called electrical, in the third and fourth toes, if one bore\r\ndown on this scar, a symptom suggesting that the dorsal nerves had been\r\ninjured. Immediately after the wound both legs had been paralyzed,\r\naccording to the soldier. He had been able only to drag himself along\r\non his shoulders. This indeterminate paralysis lasted three days. It\r\nmay have been hystero-traumatic, or it may have been a sort of diffuse\r\ninhibition. Just after the injury, the left foot was in contracture,\r\nwhich gave place a month later to paralysis. Only the great toe was\r\nstill able to move a little. In December, 1915, the patient still could\r\nextend and flex the toes on the left side very badly, though he could\r\nexecute movements easily on the right side. There was no stiffness of\r\njoints; there were no tendon reflex disorders. There were no trophic\r\nvasomotor or secretory disturbances.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of hysterical paresis seemed warranted, but electrical\r\nexamination showed that the troubles were organic. There was an\r\nincrease in the faradic and galvanic excitability of the external\r\npopliteal nerve. The response was more sudden than normal, and there\r\nwas an increase in faradic and galvanic excitability in the tibialis\r\nanticus. There was a decrease of faradic and galvanic excitability in\r\nthe extensor communis of the toes and in the external peroneus.\r\n\r\nThus, this patient after being wounded in both feet May 15, 1915,\r\nparalyzed in both feet for a period of three days, undergoing a\r\ncontracture of the left foot for a month, giving place to paralysis\r\nof foot and toes, with slow improvement from the end of July, 1915,\r\nwas still in this latter state in March, 1916; though without trophic\r\ndisorder, he showed faradic and galvanic over-excitability of the\r\nexternal popliteal nerve and of the tibialis anticus, _pari passu_ with\r\ndiminished electrical excitability for other muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\nParalysis: Hysterical? organic?\r\n\r\n=Case 429.= (GOUGEROT and CHARPENTIER, May, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man was wounded Oct. 11, 1914, on the back of the right hand. Two\r\nhours later, he was attended at the relief post. At this time, his\r\nhand was straight, with fingers extended. He said that he could not\r\nmove his fingers, although there was no pain in them. Three hours\r\nafter the wound, the hands swelled and the edema spread as far as\r\nthe middle of the forearm. There was a long suppuration, complicated\r\nby lymphangitis. All of the fragments were removed October 26, 1914;\r\nhealing was complete in three months. The swelling, however, persisted\r\nto June, 1915, and when the swelling disappeared, the hand began to\r\nshow drop-wrist. The wound was sutured between the second and third\r\nmetacarpals, and the X-ray showed that the bones had not been injured,\r\nnor had the nerves of the forearm muscles been touched. The situation\r\nwas such that the case was catalogued “functional paralysis.”\r\n\r\nOctober 5, 1915, the hand was still drooping, fingers extended, and\r\nmiddle finger and ring finger trembling. A slight stiffness of wrist\r\nand fingers did not interfere with movements. Extension of the wrist\r\ncould be made very slightly above horizontal. Flexion was not quite\r\ncomplete, nor were adduction or abduction. Extension of the fingers\r\ncould be performed normally, as well as that of the thumb, but flexion\r\nwas not quite complete. There was a slight palmar retraction. Such\r\nwere the movements that could be produced electrically. Voluntarily,\r\nflexion of the wrist was good, abduction and adduction incomplete;\r\nextension could not be executed to the horizontal position. There was\r\na tendency to flexion of the ring finger. When the patient tried to\r\nflex the middle and index fingers, these fingers trembled but did not\r\nflex. Weak extension and abduction of the thumb but without opposition\r\ncould be voluntarily performed; adduction good; flexion of the first\r\nphalanx, weak; of second phalanx, better. Slight muscular atrophy of\r\nthe forearm, which was one centimeter less in circumference than the\r\nleft. The hand was subject to a general atrophy; the skin reddish and\r\nmoist. The X-ray showed a decalcification of all the bones of the hand\r\nand wrist; trophic disturbance of the small carpal bones although\r\nthe trauma had affected only the second interosseous space. No joint\r\nlesions or periosteal thicknesses were found by X-ray. There was a\r\nslight hypesthesia of the palmar surface of the middle finger and of\r\nthe index finger. The patient complained of sharp transient pains in\r\nhand and fingers.\r\n\r\nIn this case, therefore, a wound of the back of the hand produced an\r\nimmediate inhibition of muscular action in the forearm, a rapid edema\r\nof the hand and arm, lasting for eight months and followed by reflex\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable diminution in faradic excitability of the\r\nflexor brevis of the thumb, the anterior cubital, the flexor brevis\r\nminimi digiti, and of the dorsal interossei, and slighter evidence of\r\ndiminution of galvanic excitability in some of the muscles.\r\n\r\nSollier is said to have been the first to remark trophic bone disorders\r\nin cases of neuropathic contracture.\r\n\r\n_Re_ bone changes, Babinski enumerates trophic changes in the tissue of\r\nbones and joints amongst objective signs that permit us to distinguish\r\nthe reflex or physiopathic disorders from the hysterical or pithiatic\r\ndisorders. Objective signs of this group (indicators of reflex or\r\nphysiopathic disorders) are: (_a_) Well-marked and persistent vasomotor\r\nand thermic disorder; (_b_) alterations of muscular tone (either\r\nhypotonus, hypertonus, or a combination of the two); (_c_) increase in\r\nthe mechanical excitability of the muscles and sometimes nerves; (_d_)\r\nquantitative changes in the electrical excitability of the muscles, but\r\nwithout R. D.; (_e_) muscular atrophy and atrophy of skin, bones, and\r\njoints. For cases of this nature, see especially Cases 431 and 432 of\r\nDelherm.\r\n\r\n\r\nParalysis: Hysterical? organic?\r\n\r\n=Case 430.= (GOUGEROT and CHARPENTIER, May, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man, 22, was wounded September 17, 1914, in the left hand, the bullet\r\npassing from the lower part of the fourth interosseous space out\r\nthrough the palmar face. The bones were not injured, and it was evident\r\nthat only a few nerve filaments could have been injured; but he had\r\na paralysis extending far beyond this region, which increased little\r\nby little from November, 1914, to August, 1915. Babinski, examining\r\nhim in November, 1914, had made the diagnosis of psychic paresis of\r\nthe extensors with diminution of electric excitability, with a very\r\nslight slowing of the contraction of the last two interossei and the\r\nhypothenar eminence, connected with lesion of the branches of the ulnar\r\nnerve. The disorder spread to the flexors of the fingers and the thumb\r\nmuscles. The fifth finger was flexed at rest; there was no stiffness\r\nof joint or tendon retraction. The extensors and flexors of all the\r\nfingers and the thumb, and the abductor of the thumb showed paresis.\r\nThe thumb was able to oppose; the hands were cyanotic. Augmentation\r\nof these phenomena in a period of months, their bizarre distribution,\r\nand the preservation of the opposing power of the thumb suggested\r\na hystero-organic disease, and Babinski’s notes read, “Partial and\r\nincomplete paralysis of the ulnar nerve, attacking slightly the\r\nhypothenar eminence and the last two interossei; psychic paresis of the\r\nextensors and flexors of the fingers and thumb and of the abductors of\r\nthe thumb.” Electrical examination showed, however, that there was not\r\nonly electrical disorder of the common extensors of the fingers, the\r\nextensor proprius of the index and of the ring fingers, of the long\r\nand short extensors of the thumb, but also there was a considerable\r\ndiminution to faradic and galvanic reaction in extensor ossis metacarpi\r\npollicis, the radials, the supinator longus, the pronator teres, the\r\nlarge and small palmar, the common and superficial flexors of the\r\nfingers, the muscles of the thenar eminence, the anterior ulnar, and\r\nthe anterior biceps and brachial. In short, there was an irradiation\r\nof seemingly organic phenomena in the domain of the radial, median, and\r\nthe non-injured part of the cubital distribution, as well as in the\r\ndistribution of the musculo-cutaneous. Apparently, organic paralytic\r\ndisorder had spread even to the biceps and had increased over a period\r\nof many months after the wound had healed.\r\n\r\n_Re_ what he terms _organo-hysterical association_, Babinski\r\nproposes to distinguish it from hystero-organic association. In\r\nBabinski’s organo-hysterical association, the organic symptoms are\r\npreceded by hysterical symptoms. These cases of organo-hysterical\r\nassociation,--_e.g._, a case in which a hysterical monoplegia is\r\nfollowed by a musculospiral crutch paralysis,--are one of the mainstays\r\nof the proof that hysteria and simulation cannot be confounded.\r\nBabinski concedes that he has sometimes said that hysteria was a sort\r\nof semi-simulation; yet a semi-simulation is not a simulation.\r\n\r\nAs for Babinski’s _hystero-organic association_, we here deal with\r\ncases of organic paralysis or contracture in which the fundamental\r\ndisorder is organic, and the psychic disorder is grafted upon it. Both\r\nthe fundamentally organic and the fundamentally hysterical associations\r\nare instances, according to Babinski’s phrase, of symptomatic\r\nincompatibilities. In such instances, the hysterical part of the\r\ndisorder, whether grafted or original, is dissolved by psychotherapy.\r\nThere is a third group of symptomatic incompatibilities, namely, the\r\n_hystero-reflex associations_, in which, _e.g._, a hysterical gait\r\nis combined with vasomotor and thermal disturbances. There may even\r\nbe combinations of all three types of disease, namely, the type of\r\nstructural disease, of vasomotor disorder, and of hysteria, in what\r\nwould then be termed a _hystero-reflex-organic association_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWound of toes--Wound of arm: Reflex or physiopathic paralyses,\r\ndiagnosis and treatment.\r\n\r\n=Cases 431 and 432.= (DELHERM, September, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was wounded in the soft parts of the last two toes and in the\r\nfurrow between toes on the left side, September 15, 1914, arriving in\r\nthe Central Physiotherapeutic Service of the 17th Army Region, December\r\n27, 1915, left foot in varus, with marked contracture of tibialis\r\nanticus, though passive movements of flexion, extension, adduction and\r\nabduction were well performed. There was a slight atrophy of the leg\r\n(33 cm. left to 34 cm. right). The scar was a little painful, and there\r\nwas a slight degree of hypesthesia of foot and lower leg. The foot was\r\ncold and cyanotic; the reflexes were normal. An electric examination in\r\nthe region of the external popliteal branch of the sciatic nerve showed\r\nthat there was no electrical disorder either faradic or voltaic.\r\n\r\nAnother case was wounded in the right arm by a shell fragment September\r\n7, 1914, and showed two scars above the epitrochlea and along the\r\ninternal border of the triceps. Examination December 30 showed a\r\nnormal elbow movement, pronation and supination, with slight flexion\r\nin repose of the palm of the hand and the fingers. Active flexion\r\nmovements of the fingers could be performed only imperfectly, and the\r\nfinger pad could only be brought within three fingers breadths of the\r\npalm, despite the greatest effort on the part of the patient. Minute\r\npassive movements were entirely possible. The fifth finger could not\r\nbe abducted and both abduction and adduction of the third and fourth\r\nfinger could not be made on account of the nerve lesion. The thumb was\r\nin a condition of contracture which placed it in abduction in front of\r\nthe index finger, and the thumb could not oppose. Passive movements,\r\non the other hand, were entirely possible. The hand was flexed upon\r\nthe forearm through hypertonia of the flexors, which could be easily\r\novercome with slight but distinct resistance. The hand was in the\r\nposition of a radial paralysis. There was a slight degree of muscular\r\natrophy. Tendon reflexes were normal. Electric examination showed that\r\nstimulation of the ulnar nerve at the elbow was unable to produce\r\nflexion of the last two fingers or any movement in the hypothenar\r\neminence, of which the muscles were also not excitable. The interossei\r\ncould, however, be made to contract. The median and radial nerves were\r\nnormal electrically. The above examinations were with the faradic\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nWith the galvanic current the ulnar nerve proved unexcitable at\r\nthe elbow, and the muscles of the hypothenar eminence contracted\r\nmore slowly. The median and radial nerves and their muscles were\r\nelectrically normal.\r\n\r\nIn short, there was a complete R. D. of the hypothenar and partial R.\r\nD. of the interossei as a result of the lesion of the ulnar nerve.\r\nThere was nothing abnormal in the other nerves or muscles of the arm.\r\nThe attitude of radial pseudoparalysis is due to the contracture of the\r\nmuscles of the thenar eminence.\r\n\r\nAs to therapy, the general movements of flexion of the fingers, thumb\r\nand hand yielded a marked improvement, but such results cannot be\r\nexpected in like cases unless a physician or experienced masseur treats\r\nthe case. Babinski and Froment have tried thermotherapy and diathermy\r\nin these cases, finding that the paralysis diminishes and becomes\r\npartial if the limb is warm, although it is important that it should\r\nnot become too warm. Sometimes a few treatments with diathermy will\r\nproduce movements in a case of long standing paralysis. Babinski and\r\nFroment counsel not only diathermy, but a general motor reëducation.\r\nThe idea of the diathermy is that the deeply penetrating heat affects\r\nblood vessels and muscles, bringing about a vasodilatation or even a\r\ndirect addition of needed calories. In like manner, galvanism, light\r\nbaths, or simple baths in combination, and with diathermy, especially\r\nwith the diathermy, act favorably. Casts and apparatus have also proved\r\nwithout avail, as well as faradic or galvanic reëducation.\r\n\r\nThe above two cases show how in one instance there may be no electrical\r\nchange and in another instance a slight one. In these cases, reflex\r\nhypertonic contracture, hypotonic paralysis, vasomotor disorder,\r\ndecalcification of the skeleton (X-ray), mechanical overexcitability\r\nof muscles, unmodified tendon reflexes (except elective exaggeration\r\nof reflex under anesthesia, _e.g._, a persistent unilateral patellar\r\nclonus when all other reflexes have been abolished), and disorders of\r\nelectrical excitation are enumerated by Babinski and Froment.\r\n\r\nDelherm sums up the electrical disorders as follows: Muscle faradized:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) No change.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Subexcitability.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Overexcitability.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Diminished contractility to faradism, associated with\r\n          increased contractility by galvanism (Charpentier).\r\n\r\n    (_e_) Anticipated fusion of shocks (Babinski and Froment).\r\n\r\n    (_f_) Slow contraction and decontraction on faradism\r\n          (Charpentier).\r\n\r\n    (_g_) Rapid exhaustion of rhythmic faradic contraction with\r\n          metronome.\r\n\r\nMuscle galvanized:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) No change.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Subexcitability.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) Overexcitability.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) Suddenness of galvanic contraction with subexcitability.\r\n\r\n_Re_ decalcification and osteo-articular changes, Babinski points out\r\nthat the reflex or physiopathic phenomena run historically back to\r\nJohn Hunter, Charcot, and Vulpian. Charcot and Vulpian called especial\r\nattention to the peculiar amyotrophy and paralysis which occurred in\r\njoint disease, and upon the lack of parallelism betwixt the intensity\r\nof the joint disease and the severity of the paralysis or atrophy. The\r\natrophy was without R. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Functional blindness (monosymptomatic).\r\n\r\n=Case 433.= (CROUZON, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA shell burst above the head of a sergeant in a battle near Neuf\r\nchâteau, August 22, 1914. The man was kneeling at the time; felt a\r\nterrible shock, slipped prone, lost consciousness and woke in the\r\nevening blind. Next day he could hardly distinguish light from dark.\r\nYet the light reflexes were normal; the fundus was normal.\r\n\r\nThis Crouzon calls the symptomatic triad for functional nerve blindness\r\nof Dieulafoy. There have been similar cases following eclipse of the\r\nsun and nervous shock. The eclipse cases suggest that the bright flash\r\nmight have something to do with the sudden blindness (yet blindness has\r\nappeared in cases in which the shell burst behind the patient).\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of temporary blindness, with a prognosis of early\r\nrecovery, was made. The neurological examination was normal.\r\n\r\nFor its suggestive effect, glycerophosphate injections and progressive\r\nreëducative measures were adopted. The patient was shown that he could\r\nsee, first, the contour of objects, then details and colors, then large\r\nletters and later small letters. In a month the blindness was almost\r\nwell. Five months afterwards there was still a certain haze over the\r\nfield of vision and a slight difficulty in distinguishing certain\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nJousset states that aside from visual alterations as the result of\r\ncranial trauma, and aside from various transitory amblyopias such as\r\nscintillating scotoma, the main varieties of amblyopia are:\r\n\r\n_First_, Congenital amblyopia.\r\n\r\n_Second_, Amblyopia due to cerebral intoxication.\r\n\r\n_Third_, Retrobulbar neuritis and toxic amblyopia.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, Amblyopia ex anopsia.\r\n\r\n_Fifth_, Hysterical amblyopia.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent amblyopias among the soldiers are exanopsia. Aside\r\nfrom a few amblyopias caused by prolonged occlusion of the eyelids,\r\nptosis, or blepharospasm, the most frequent are due to opacities,\r\nametropia, and strabismus. The hysterical amblyopias are, as a rule,\r\nassociated with blepharospasm due to intense photophobia, and are\r\nsometimes associated with constant lacrimation. Vision at a distance\r\nis poor. The patient succeeds in reading but shows an asthenopia of\r\nfatigue. The cornea and the conjunctiva are anesthetic, and sometimes\r\nthe eyelids also,--the so-called anesthesia _en lunettes_. The pupils\r\nare large but react properly. The patient complains of many species\r\nof disorder; loss of the sense of the third proportion, micropsia,\r\nmegalopsia, diplopia, erythropsia, diplopia in two colors, inverted\r\nimage, hemierythropsia, rotatory amblyopia. There is concentrated\r\nlimitation of visual fields, exaggerated by fatigue and by intense\r\nlight; reduced in dim light or when the patient is provided with smoked\r\nglasses; enlarged upon the instillation of atropin or with convex\r\nglasses. As a rule, with unilateral amblyopia, the functional disorders\r\nstart in binocular vision. Practically the most important diagnostic\r\nfeature is the anesthesia, since this cannot be readily simulated.\r\nSometimes corneal anesthesia is found in non-hysterical persons, who\r\nmay perhaps be regarded as potential hysterics.\r\n\r\n\r\nRetrobulbar neuritis (nitrophenol).\r\n\r\n=Case 434.= (SOLLIER AND JOUSSET, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier of the 54th Artillery entered hospital 45, November 4, 1916.\r\nHe had had a slight paralysis of the left brachial plexus in 1913,\r\nfollowing a shoulder dislocation, but the only relic of this when the\r\nwar began was a deltoid paresis. He had been working from August 13,\r\n1915, at the factory in Saint-Fons, and was as yellow as the majority\r\nof the workers there. He had never shown xanthopsia.\r\n\r\nThe first symptoms of his left brachial plexus neuritis had begun\r\nsix months before, after 9 months’ work in the factory, and showed\r\nthemselves in an increase of the deltoid paresis, with pains in the\r\nhand and forearm, and cramps of the hand, interfering with work,\r\nformication in the right hand and in the feet, diminution of visual\r\npeculiarity (objects forgotten and reading difficult). It was only in\r\nNovember that he got perturbed about these difficulties, which had\r\nbegun in May. There was a paralysis of the levators and rotators of\r\nthe left shoulder, with a slight atrophy of the deltoid and of the\r\nsupra- and infraspinatus muscles. The arm could be extended almost\r\nto the horizontal with difficulty. There was one centimeter atrophy.\r\nThe forearm and hand were not atrophic but slightly weak. There was\r\nan anesthesia of the shoulder-joint region, and of the outer surface\r\nof the arm; a hypesthesia of the posterior surface of the forearm and\r\ndorsal surface of the hand and fingers; tendon and periosteal reflexes\r\nnormal. Sometimes the hand would contract firmly and could be opened\r\nonly by the aid of the other hand. The nerve trunks of the axilla,\r\nupper arm, and forearm, were painful on pressure, especially on the\r\nleft side, and the ulnar nerve was thickened and rolled under the\r\nfinger. The knee-jerk and Achilles jerk were abolished on the right;\r\nplantar reflex diminished; right posterior tibial nerve painful on\r\npressure, and its territory was hypesthetic. There were cramps in the\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nGymnastics and electrotherapy and rest reduced these phenomena. The\r\neye grounds were normal; there was a paresis of accommodation, and an\r\nabsolute blindness to green, with retraction of fields to 15 degrees\r\nin the right eye, and 20 on the left. There later developed a slight\r\nedematous neuritis of the nerve, corresponding to the evolution of a\r\nchronic retrobulbar neuritis of toxic origin.\r\n\r\nIt is the chronic retrobulbar neuritis which is typical of the\r\nso-called nitrophenol neuritis, developing in soldiers employed in\r\nmaking explosives. The above case is accordingly exceptional in its\r\nassociation of a severe peripheral neuritis with the optic neuritis.\r\nTypically, after six months to a year in the factory, the cramps\r\nand formication of the legs are felt, and the gradual diminution\r\nof vision with transient blindness, finally leading to inability\r\nto read, sets in. The green blindness, the accommodative paresis,\r\nand diminution of central vision, the concentric contraction of the\r\nvisual fields, are the usual story. At first the eye grounds are\r\nnormal; there is then an edematous neuritis, and finally a white\r\natrophy. According to Sollier, the accommodative paresis is like that\r\nin post-diphtheritic paralysis--a disease due to cerebral cortex\r\nintoxication. In fact, the photomotor reflex is normal, and what we\r\nhave is an inversion of the Argyll-Robertson sign. These symptoms are\r\nthose of retrobulbar neuritis, of nicotino-ethylic origin, and it may\r\nbe thought that the melinite was simply acting by creating a soil for\r\nalcoholic intoxication, but none of the patients examined has been\r\nalcoholic, nor has any been permitted to smoke in the factory. The\r\ninjurious agent is probably a body in the nitrophenol series, perhaps\r\ndinitrochlorobenzol, but whether this substance is absorbed through\r\nthe skin, inhaled, ingested from the hands, or by all three routes,\r\nis doubtful. These workers are often cyanotic while at work because\r\nthe nitre products produce vasodilatation. Possibly this dilatation of\r\nvessels has something to do with the neuritis. The workmen will not use\r\nthe spectacles and antitoxic masks given them, and even do not use the\r\nrubber gloves constantly. In some factories only, a liter of milk is\r\ngiven as counterpoison, every day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlight wound of occiput: Ophthalmoplegia externa, influencible,\r\nhowever, by tests and replaced by spasmodic convergence of globes with\r\nmyosis; hysterical stigmata and convulsions.\r\n\r\n=Case 435.= (WESTPHAL, September, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA German volunteer, 20, was slightly wounded in the occiput by\r\nrevolver-shot at Ypres. Then followed headaches, vertigo, and\r\ncomplaints of pains in the eyes such that he could not open them or\r\nsee sidewise. May 5, 1915, he showed a picture of an ophthalmoplegia\r\nexterna: complete immobility of the two bulbi, lively blepharoclonus,\r\nrapidly passing into blepharospasm, photophobia. The visual field for\r\nwhite was practically limited to the fixation point. Central scotoma\r\nfor all colors. Otherwise normal.\r\n\r\nOn further examination, the apparently immobile bulbi were found to\r\npass into convergence upon request to look to the right or left.\r\n_Thereafter_, this position of convergence was assumed if any test\r\nmade by a strong light, such as that of a pocket flash, was used.\r\nThe pupils contracted to the maximum during this assumption of the\r\nconvergent position of the globes, and no further light reaction could\r\nbe observed. The convergence gradually passed off when the light was\r\nremoved. The appearance of bilateral external ophthalmoplegia had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nIf the patient was requested to follow a finger moved to one side, the\r\nglobe of that side to which the finger was being moved, stood unmoved\r\nin its central position, but the other globe followed the eye and\r\nplaced itself in the convergent position. The patient complained of\r\ndiplopia. Even after the closure of one eye a double vision appeared\r\n(monocular diplopia). There was achromatopsia. The cornea failed to\r\nreact to stimulation.\r\n\r\nThere was an analgesia of the skin of the whole body, with a\r\nhypesthesia for tactile stimuli on the left side. Smell and taste\r\nabsent. The convergent position of the globes with myosis was preserved\r\nin the midst of convulsive seizures, which could be produced by\r\nexciting the patient. When it was attempted to dissolve the eye\r\ntroubles by hypnosis, convulsive attacks occurred. The patient was\r\npronouncedly hysterical.\r\n\r\nThe case is beyond question hysterical,--the phenomena consisting of\r\nan ophthalmoplegia externa, alternating with spasmodic contracture of\r\nthe internal recti, associated with myosis and loss of light reaction.\r\nThe influencibility of this situation during the process of tests, to\r\nsay nothing of the other stigmata, clinches the diagnosis--an important\r\none, since the development of an external ophthalmoplegia after\r\noccipital trauma might possibly be regarded as an organic disease due\r\nto hemorrhage in the region of the eye-muscle nuclei.\r\n\r\n\r\nSandbag drops on head: Internal strabismus and diplopia. Various\r\ndiagnoses. Cure by lenses.\r\n\r\n=Case 436.= (HARWOOD, September, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA four-pound wet sandbag fell eight feet on the head of a\r\nsergeant-major, 28, lying in a Gallipoli dug-out, November 24, 1915.\r\nThe sergeant-major was removed to Lemnos with headache and giddiness,\r\nand a week later developed bilateral internal strabismus with double\r\nvision and head noises. The diagnosis was “brain tumor” or “syphilitic\r\nmeningitis of the base.” On the voyage home, the diagnosis was altered\r\nto “multiple neuritis or neurasthenia.”\r\n\r\nHe was admitted to the King George Hospital, January 1, 1916, unable\r\nto move the eyes outwards; they moved rather poorly up and down. There\r\nwas a slight lateral nystagmus. The patient had been unable to read or\r\nstand since the accident. The visual acuity of each eye was less than\r\n6/60, but with an arrangement of lenses he could get 6/5 with either\r\neye. He had perfect binocular vision and could read ordinary type\r\ncomfortably. In a week’s time he was able to stand without support and\r\nwalk with a stick. Whenever he took off the glasses, the strabismus and\r\ndiplopia immediately returned. Other combinations were tried but failed\r\nto relieve symptoms. The lenses given were +0.375 c. Vert. and L. +0.25\r\nS. +0.25 C. 75 do.\r\n\r\n\r\nHemianopsia: organic or functional?\r\n\r\n=Case 437.= (STEINER, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA 19-year old volunteer, never ill (no nervous disease in the family),\r\nafter a period of training went into the field, October 3, 1914.\r\nNovember 5, a shell struck the trench nearby but failed to explode. Up\r\nto that time everything had been quiet. The soldier had been looking\r\nout of the loophole, surveying the terrain. He felt a great fear, got\r\na blow in the neck, fell down unconscious, remained unconscious for\r\nan unknown time, and later walked back with his comrades. About an\r\nhour later, this volunteer,--who was a very intelligent young man,\r\npossessing much knowledge of biology, including the nature of visual\r\nfields,--noticed a black spot in the field of vision, which came and\r\nwent, but after a few hours remained continually without disappearing.\r\nOtherwise, there was no complaint except a feeling of dizziness when\r\nstooping.\r\n\r\nUpon examination there could be found no disorder of the internal\r\norgans. Neurologically there was blinking, vasomotor excitability,\r\nslight reddening of the face, and dermatographia. An expert in\r\nophthalmology confirmed the existence of a homonymous defect in the\r\nfields of vision. This defect could not be influenced by suggestion or\r\nby any other treatment, nor did any other change whatever occur in the\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nSteiner inquires whether this hemianopsia is to be taken as organic\r\nor functional. The air-pressure of the shell hissing past might have\r\nproduced a concussion, or the falling unconscious might have produced\r\na commotio cerebri or a slight hemorrhage. The tic-like blinking and\r\nvasomotor excitability, however, suggest functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical pseudoptosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 438.= (LAIGNEL-LAVASTINE and BALLET, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nLaignel-Lavastine and Ballet present a case of what they term\r\nhysterical pseudoptosis in a patient who showed no signs of organic\r\ndisease of the nervous system, and moreover no special mental disorder.\r\nThis soldier, 30 years of age, working in the auxiliary service,\r\nsuffered from a troublesome lowering of his left upper eyelid. He went\r\nto the front in February, 1915. Aside from suffering a few mild and\r\ntemporary blindnesses (_éblouissements_), he was entirely well up to\r\nthe time of being wounded, March 18, 1915, by a bullet in the arm, and\r\na bullet occasioning a superficial and slight wound 2½ centimeters\r\nabove the middle of the left eyebrow. About three years later, a shell\r\nburst near him and made a large contusion about the right eye, without\r\nhurting the globus. He was then evacuated to Châlons-sur-Marne, and\r\nthere remained for 48 hours, totally blind, probably on account of\r\nspasmodic closure of his eyelids. He then began to be able to use the\r\nleft eye, which remained, however, very photophobic. A fortnight later,\r\nthe wounds were healed, but the patient found himself unable to open\r\nhis right eye. Three months later he returned to his dépôt, and left\r\nfor the front October 24.\r\n\r\nHe was reëvacuated November 4, as unsuitable for service. He was then\r\nexamined by an ophthalmologist at Chartres, who found a very mobile\r\nright pupil and a slightly atrophic right papilla; vision ½; left eye\r\nnormal; vision ⅔; total paralysis of right levator palpebrae superioris\r\nwithout contracture of orbicularis. There was also paresis of the left\r\nupper lid, which ceased when the right eye was closed. The right half\r\nof the face was anesthetic, but there was no corneal anesthesia.\r\n\r\nNovember 15: Right eyebrow lower than left; if the head was moved\r\nbackward, the right eyelid followed the movements, and in this position\r\nthere was no ptosis.\r\n\r\nNovember 16: Analgesia in the super- and sub-orbicular region. November\r\n17: frontalis and orbicularis functions normal.\r\n\r\nAt time of examination, patient complained of not being able to open\r\nhis right eye, and that he could only partly open the left eye. To\r\ncatch a view of his examiner, he had to throw his head back and to the\r\nright. He could not open his eyelids, and in the effort to do so, the\r\nforehead muscles contracted; and whereas the left eyebrow was properly\r\nelevated, the right eyebrow was only partially elevated. Associated\r\nmovements could be noted in the musculature of the lower part of the\r\nface. In looking to the right, the eyelids, especially the left, were\r\nelevated slightly. The patient complained of photophobia. From time\r\nto time, he felt completely blind, and at the end of these spells of\r\nblindness, he had a severe headache. His head felt heavy. Sometimes on\r\nlooking to the left, he saw objects double, although this diplopia had\r\ngrown less marked of late. All the muscles of both eyes appeared to\r\nwork normally. Upon pressure on the right globus, especially pressure\r\ndirected from above and behind on the internal part, the patient would\r\nraise his left eyelid, but the paresis reappeared the moment the\r\npressure was released; a fact which the patient himself noted while a\r\ntampon was being placed upon his eye.\r\n\r\nIt seems there had been a wound at the external angle of the eye, some\r\nnine or ten years before, as a consequence of which the eyelid of this\r\nside could never be parted as well as before. The accident in question\r\nhad happened in 1905, and there had been a slight suppuration of a\r\nwound 2½ centimeters from the external angle of the palpable fissure.\r\n\r\nThe patient then went through a period of reëducation. It seemed that\r\nwhen he was trying to raise his eyelids, there was a mental inhibition\r\nwhich could be overcome only by effort. An attempt may be made to\r\nresolve the phenomena into three groups:\r\n\r\nFirst, enophthalmia of the right side (post-traumatic, antebellum, a\r\npredisposing cause).\r\n\r\nSecondly, a situation corresponding to so-called hysterical\r\npseudoptosis of Charcot and Parinaud (eyelid falling without wrinkles,\r\nhead thrown back, frontalis contraction on effort to open eyes, eyelid\r\nlowered). The diagnosis of hysteria was supported by the transient\r\nopening of both eyelids when a sudden sharp order was given to move the\r\neye-_balls_, and further supported by synergic automatic lid-movements\r\nwhen the patient voluntarily raised his eyes. He could not raise his\r\neyelids to order.\r\n\r\nThirdly, functional ocular palpable synergy (left eye opening upon\r\ncompressing the right eye).\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock Rombergism.\r\n\r\n=Case 439.= (BECK, June, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 24, had sundry signs of traumatic neurosis. A curious and\r\nunexplained feature is the fact that in the course of testing for\r\nRombergism he would fall forward like a log if his head were held in\r\nthe vertical position, but if it were turned to the right he fell to\r\nthe right; if it were turned to the left, he fell backward. Tests\r\nshowed that he had no disease of the vestibular apparatus and no sign\r\neither of cerebral or of cerebellar disease.\r\n\r\nThe question is raised whether shell-shock can produce a differential\r\nRombergism such as hitherto would have been explained on the basis of\r\nsome organic vestibular disease.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Rombergism, see especially Bourgeois and Sourdille’s (edited\r\nby Dundas Grant) remarks on disturbances of balance which, if of\r\nlabyrinthine origin, obey Romberg’s law, namely, are greatly increased\r\nwith the eyes closed. Upon test, however, normal equilibrium,\r\ntottering, or a tendency to fall will be usually found. The tendency to\r\nfall is, as a rule, toward the side of the affected labyrinth, yet it\r\nvaries according to the position of the head; that is to say, actually\r\nupon the position of the labyrinth with relation to the body. If there\r\nis a lesion of the right labyrinth, for example, and the head is turned\r\nto the right, falling is to the right; but if the head is turned 90\r\ndegrees toward the right, the patient tends to fall backward because in\r\nfact the injured right labyrinth has now become posterior in position.\r\nBut if the head with the injured right labyrinth is displaced 90\r\ndegrees to the left, the tendency would be to fall forwards.\r\n\r\nAccording to Beck, there was in his case of Shell-shock Rombergism no\r\near disease or any evidence of cerebellar or cerebral disease.\r\n\r\nWalking with the eyes open yields in marked instances a sidewise\r\nbending or even the classical staggering called the duck’s walk and\r\ndrunken gait upon a broad base. The most delicate test, according to\r\nBourgeois and Sourdille, is the Babinski-Weil test of walking with the\r\neyes shut. A man with labyrinthine disease deviates from the straight\r\npath (he is made to walk forwards and backwards ten times in a clear\r\nspace); bends pretty constantly to one side when walking forward,\r\nand pretty constantly to the other side when walking backwards.\r\nSpontaneous and Babinski’s induced nystagmus (rotation; caloric) and\r\nBabinski’s voltaic vertigo test are the other tests commonly employed\r\nin equilibrium investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOtology and neuropsychiatry should go hand in hand.\r\n\r\n=Case 440.= (ROUSSY and BOISSEAU, May, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in the engineers, 29, entered the neuropsychiatric center\r\nat Scey-sur-Saône, August 23, 1916. His diagnosis was: organic shock\r\nsyndrome with right-side deafness and tremors. He carried a ticket\r\nshowing an otological examination: tympanum normal; Rombergism absent;\r\nwalks with eyes closed swerving to right; tends to fall, eyes closed,\r\non standing on one foot; vertigo produced by rotation in either\r\ndirection; no nystagmus either spontaneous or by test; deafness\r\nespecially on the right side; equilibrium function insufficient.\r\n\r\nThe patient had undergone shock in April, 1915, being buried and then\r\nlosing consciousness for twenty-four hours. The tremors appeared next\r\nday, and also deafness but without speech disorder. Nine comrades\r\nare said to have been killed beside him. The hospital ticket, April\r\n13, said: deafness and multiple contusions from shell explosion. The\r\npatient was evacuated to Clarmont-Ferrand and went back to service with\r\nthe same tremor and auditory disorder. He was shortly sent back to the\r\ninterior for six months and returned improved to the front August,\r\n1915. But he heard the cannon in the distance, and, under the influence\r\nof emotion and the fatigue of the journey, the tremors and deafness\r\nreappeared.\r\n\r\nThe tremor was generalized, involving both arms and legs and a slight\r\nlateral movement of negation of the head every ten or twelve seconds.\r\nOccasionally tonic contracture of the face, lips, cheeks, forehead;\r\ntremors of tongue; winking. The tremors were somewhat suggestive of\r\ntoxic tremors.\r\n\r\nThe deafness was evidently exaggerated. Voltaic vertigo tested normal.\r\nReflexes normal.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis psychoneurosis was made and the patient was rigorously\r\nisolated, given a long psychotherapeutic talk concerning the nonreality\r\nof his deafness and his vertigo and the possibility of cure by means\r\nof a very disagreeable electrical treatment. He made improvement upon\r\npsycho-electrical treatment and the next day both tremors and deafness\r\nhad greatly diminished. September 4, the patient was considered\r\ncompletely well. There was a slight diminution of hearing in the right\r\near, the whispered voice was heard at 50 centimeters on the right side,\r\nthe watch at 25 centimeters on the right and 60 on the left.\r\n\r\nOctober 5 the patient was sent back to his corps. On the evening of\r\nhis departure, angry at not having received leave, he boasted to his\r\ncomrades of having passed but three days at the front since his injury.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, according to Roussy and Boisseau that this patient\r\nhad passed sixteen months without ever having been taken for a\r\nneuropath or treated as one. The otologists gave the diagnosis\r\nof labyrinthine shock, but did not attend to the tremors. The\r\npseudo-symptoms disappeared in six days at the neurological center and\r\nthe cure had lasted six weeks at the time of report.\r\n\r\n_Re_ otology in these cases, see Bourgeois and Sourdille’s book\r\nmentioned under Case No. 439, particularly Chapter III, upon the\r\nfunctional examination of hearing. In the present instance, it will be\r\nnoted that voltaic vertigo tested out normal. According to Bourgeois\r\nand Sourdille, the Babinski electrical test is the most convenient\r\none to begin with, to learn in a few moments whether the vestibular\r\nsystem is working normally or not. These authors found amongst twelve\r\npatients, three normal reactions and one instance of hypo-excitability\r\namongst four subjects who, by other tests, failed to show vestibular\r\ndisturbance. Inexcitability as to voltaic vertigo was found in\r\none man with a destroyed labyrinth. There were four instances of\r\nhyperexcitability in Babinski’s cases with marked equilibrium disorder.\r\nA case of Ménière’s disease yielded the same results. According to\r\nthe intensity of the current, the following phenomena (in addition to\r\nthe pricking sensation) are noted; (_a_) salty taste; (_b_) sidewise\r\nswaying with slight vertigo; (_c_) nystagmus with more pronounced\r\nvertigo; (_d_) sensations of sound. In short, nerve branches that go\r\nthrough the petrous bone, namely, the chorda tympani, the vestibular\r\nnerve, and the cochlear nerve, have been successively stimulated.\r\nBabinski’s test was published before the Barany work on induced\r\nnystagmus, but Barany’s rotation test for the physiological excitation\r\nof the semi-circular canals, and his caloric test for the investigation\r\nof the ears and canals separately are to be utilized in addition to\r\nthe Babinski voltaic test. Babinski’s law of voltaic vertigo is that a\r\nnormal subject inclines to the side of the positive pole; a pathologic\r\nsubject falls to the side to which he tends to incline spontaneously.\r\nIf the labyrinth has been destroyed, there has been no reaction.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Case 440, Roussy and Boisseau in their capacity as\r\nneuropsychiatrists, point out the inadequacy of an otological\r\nexamination taken by itself. They insist that neuropsychiatrists\r\nshould be called in. It is probably equally true that neuropsychiatric\r\nwork upon deaf cases is often inadequate on account of the lack of\r\notological examinations. According to Bourgeois and Sourdille, the\r\nexpert otologist’s problems are as follows: (_a_) Deafmutism; here\r\nGault’s cochleopalpebral reflex is of value. The hearing of a sudden\r\nnoise causes contraction of the orbicularis palpebrarum on the side\r\nupon which the noise is suddenly and unexpectedly made. Eyelash tips\r\nare particularly watched.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Complete bilateral deafness. This is practically never organic;\r\ncomplete bilateral deafness is a phenomenon either of traumatic\r\nhysteria or of simulation. Sundry methods of surprising the patient\r\ninto hearing have been adopted. The practice of teaching lip-reading to\r\nsimulators and hysterics has led to some difficulties in diagnosis, but\r\ntests have been produced by Gosset (of one sound with the lips set to\r\nform another, and the like) which are of service.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Extreme bilateral dulness of hearing.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Total unilateral deafness. For the minutiae of tests for these\r\ntypes of hearing disorder and their simulation and exaggeration, see\r\nthe War Manual of Bourgeois and Sourdille.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacksonian syndrome: Hysterical.\r\n\r\n=Case 441.= (JEANSELME and HUET, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Lieutenant of Infantry, 32, was struck by a bullet September 6,\r\n1914, in the upper part of the left temporal fossa 4 cm. above the\r\nexternal auditory meatus. He did not lose consciousness, but had the\r\nsensation as if his head had been shot off, and about three minutes\r\nlater he turned about, fell down, and lost consciousness. However, he\r\nregained consciousness a few minutes later and walked with support\r\nfor about an hour. At the ambulance, he lost consciousness again, for\r\nhalf an hour. He was then carried to Amalie-les-Bains. The trip lasted\r\n108 hours. The left side of the face was now swollen so that he could\r\nnot open the eye nor could he chew from swollen mucosa folded between\r\nthe jaws. The bullet was removed Sept. 12, from just below the scalp\r\noutside the bone, the point being slightly bent back. The bone had\r\nbeen depressed slightly for an area the size of a franc piece, and\r\npressure at this point yielded a feeling of pain and discomfort. There\r\nwas no suppuration. After a week, the man got up. He returned to his\r\ndépôt October 3 or 4 and was about to rejoin his corps when he had a\r\nsensation of pressure in the head and fell. When he came to himself he\r\nfound that there was a frothy saliva at the left side of the mouth and\r\nthat the whole left side of the body felt weak. The tongue had not been\r\nbitten nor had urine been passed, and twenty minutes later he felt as\r\nwell as ever. He returned to the front in the Argonne, having from time\r\nto time similar crises,--at least once a week. Ordered to take a trench\r\nthe night of January 17, he failed the first time, about midnight, but\r\nsucceeded at four in the morning,--just afterward falling exhausted in\r\nanother crisis, with unconsciousness. The stretcher bearers took him\r\nback and he was evacuated to Perpignan. He had two convulsions.\r\n\r\nWhile with his family the crises grew in number to three or four a\r\nweek, and sometimes twice a day. Upon request, he was sent to hospital\r\nin the Pantheon May 5.\r\n\r\nThere was always a sensory aura, consisting in a violent shock felt in\r\nthe left side of the cranium like a blow of a club. There immediately\r\nfollowed a crawling sensation in the fingers and hand of the left\r\nside, running up the arm, with loss of consciousness coming on before\r\nthe crawling reached the elbow. The seizure would last two or three\r\nminutes. There was no initial cry. The face grew pale. There was apnea,\r\nand frothy fluid running out of the left side of the mouth. There was\r\nno jerking of face or limbs; at the end of the seizure there were no\r\ndeep inspirations. The extremities of the left side were rather flaccid\r\nduring the attack.\r\n\r\nA hemianesthesia was found affecting both skin and mucosae of the left\r\nside, and a slight retraction of the visual field on the left side\r\nwas found. There were no other sensory disorders; the knee-jerks were\r\nlively on both sides but not actually exaggerated. Plantar stimulation\r\nwas not perceived on the left side. The toes, except the great toe,\r\nwere slightly extended. The fascia lata reflex failed to demonstrate\r\nitself. On the right side the great toe went into flexion on forcibly\r\nstimulating the sole. Sometimes the abdominal reflex on the left side\r\nwas weak or even absent. The patient, who had never been nervous, had\r\nnow become so since his attacks. He had had nocturia up to 12. There\r\nwas no evidence of neurosis or psychosis in the family. Bromides\r\ndiminished the crises a little in number. Static electricity was given\r\nfrom January 8,--no attacks for 8 to 10 days.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jeanselme and Huet, this is a case of Jacksonian syndrome\r\nof an hysterical nature, about which it may be noted that the bullet\r\nstruck the left side of the skull and the hemianesthesia and muscular\r\nresolution appeared on the same side as the injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeg tic: Phobia against crabs.\r\n\r\n=Case 442.= (DUPRAT, October, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man, shell-shocked in 1916 (with loss of consciousness,\r\ndisorientation and confusion followed by nightmares, memory\r\ndisorder, attention disorder, irritability, mental instability and\r\nover-emotionalism) later still showed a choreiform tic. He had a\r\nknife-grinding movement of the left leg which made standing and\r\nwalking difficult. There were no signs in the reflexes or reactions of\r\norganic disease. The man himself said that he felt a sensation like\r\nlittle electric shocks when his foot touched the ground, a sensation\r\nlike pinching. He also had certain hysteriform crises. He was able to\r\nremember nightmares in which he felt as if he had fallen into a hole\r\nwhere there were crabs. In point of fact, he had a true phobia against\r\ncrabs, crayfish, lobsters and the like; if he saw one, he always felt\r\nas if he were going to have a new crisis. The defense movement of the\r\nleg and foot was against a supposed pinch of the crab. At rest, there\r\nwas no trace of the choreiform movement. The tic was especially marked\r\nwhen the man was suddenly asked to get up and walk. In a few days,\r\nwhen he had become more clearly conscious of his phobia and had slept\r\nbetter, the tic grew appreciably less.\r\n\r\n\r\nConvulsions reminiscent of fright.\r\n\r\n=Case 443.= (DUPRAT, October, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 28, was blown up February 8, 1915, by a shell burst. He\r\nsustained no contusions but became completely mute. On July 3, he began\r\nto speak in a low voice. The _torpillage_ treatment was unsuccessful\r\nbecause the man felt a morbid apprehension that the vibration of a loud\r\nvoice or even of a rapid walk would resound in his brain. He had a sort\r\nof noise phobia, probably maintained by nightmares which frequently\r\nwoke him up with a jerk though he could not remember their content.\r\nOn the way back to his dépôt this man got off the train at the first\r\nstation and went to a hospital complaining that the vibration of the\r\ntrain was going to be transmitted to his brain. Hysteriform crises\r\ndeveloped in a few days.\r\n\r\nAccording to Duprat these crises are nothing but a psychomotor\r\ndevelopment of the initial complex. The clonic and tonic convulsions\r\nare reminders of his states of extreme fright, a phenomenon of revival\r\nof the ideo-affective process, aggravated however by the oniric or\r\npost-oniric images.\r\n\r\n_Re_ diagnosis of hysterical fits, the absence of facial cyanosis,\r\nsub-conjunctival hemorrhages, petechiae of skin, and the Babinski\r\nreflex are suggestive for hysteria. Babinski points out that the\r\ninitial cry, the fall, the loss of consciousness, the tongue-biting,\r\nthe bloody frothing at the mouth, the urinary incontinence, and the\r\npost-convulsive prostration can all be consciously or unconsciously\r\nimitated. Hysterical convulsive movements are apt to be of wide range,\r\ngesticulatory, and opisthotonic.\r\n\r\nBabinski announces to the supposed hysteric that he is going to\r\nreproduce the attack, as he is perfectly able to do by electricity.\r\nA mild current or mere electrode application suggests a fit in a\r\nhysteric, often very quickly. Babinski now announces that he can arrest\r\nthe fit; carries out some selected procedure, and stops the fit. During\r\nthe hysterical fit, the patient of course hears what is being said and\r\nduring this time wrong suggestions must not be offered.\r\n\r\n\r\nFugue in a motor cyclist, with prodromal fatigue and subsequent\r\ndelusions--recovery in six weeks.\r\n\r\n=Case 444.= (MALLET, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA motor-cyclist, 36, with the colors from the outbreak of the war,\r\nabout April, 1916, grew very weary, suffering from headache and\r\nseizures without loss of consciousness. Finally there was a voice:\r\n“Sleep, you must sleep.” Then other voices; then ideas of thought\r\ntransference with people around him.\r\n\r\nObserved in the psychiatric center, May 12, 1916, he had the same ideas\r\nof thought transference, and he made as if to talk with the attendants\r\nby responsive-looking gestures. Sometimes, he said, fluid struck his\r\nforehead, calling on his thought. Whereupon he listened. The man made\r\nno complaints about his plight, was not astonished in any wise at what\r\nwas happening, nor did he seek to explain it. There was nothing in\r\nhis history to suggest psychopathy except perhaps that his father was\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of a chronic hallucinatory psychosis was made, but the\r\noutcome promptly overset the diagnosis. The man talked with ward-mates,\r\nand particularly with another patient who also talked about thought\r\ntransference. This shook the man in his convictions, and he decided\r\nthat it was but imagination and delirium.\r\n\r\nHe now told his story: How it seemed that he had in his thoughts the\r\nphrase, “Sleep, you must sleep;” how he had gotten up, saying, “No;”\r\nhad noticed the others paying no attention to him; had gone back to his\r\nwork and from that moment had begun to go into delirium. During this\r\ndelirium or delusional state, his whole life from birth up, came back\r\nto him, as if some one were telling him. The headaches, which he at\r\nfirst felt due to Hertzian waves, suddenly ceased.\r\n\r\nShortly, however, a new phase had set in, in which he felt himself\r\nsurrounded by spies and that others had control of his thoughts and\r\nwere reading them. In fact, he grew a little proud of the fact that\r\npeople reading newspapers all around him were actually reading his\r\nown thoughts. The letters he wrote were being dictated. May 9, he\r\nspent a night with a succession of nightmares, and woke up with the\r\nfirm purpose of going back to Paris by motor cycle to find the spies.\r\nHe described his fugue and the thousand ideas he had on the way, his\r\narrest, his imprisonment in a cell of Hertzian waves with a smell of\r\nsulphur and poisoned bread--a necessary fate on account of the spies.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at hospital, he had not known what was going forward.\r\nThe nurses were giving him milk to destroy the taste of sulphur;\r\nthe delirium then grew less and less. The room-mates were neutrals,\r\nwar-weary; he seemed to be reading the newspapers before his mates, and\r\nthey seemed to be talking of thought transference. May 20, the ward was\r\nchanged. The new ward-mates did not believe in thought transference and\r\nlaughed, causing the man to doubt.\r\n\r\nJune 2, the cure was in full process, and the ward was changed again;\r\nbut in the new ward was a patient who had the same ideas of thought\r\ntransference as the patient. At this time, the man’s autocritique\r\nsaw through the delusion. He talked with his telepathic comrade and\r\npretended to engage in a fake conversation about it. The delusions\r\nshortly disappeared, having lasted about six weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinary gunner’s life; a few days’ feeling of moral and physical\r\ndiscomfort: Obsession leading to fugue.\r\n\r\n=Case 445.= (MALLET, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn artilleryman, 32, gave himself up a few kilometers back of the\r\nlines, three days after deserting his post. The man was a very good\r\ngunner and had never been punished once. Moreover, the battery was not\r\nunder any special bombardment, and he had been in the same place a\r\nnumber of weeks.\r\n\r\nHe explained that he had gotten tired during the last few days.\r\nEverything was well at home and in the regiment, but he felt sad, his\r\nhead felt bad, and he couldn’t sleep. Something drew him to leave,\r\nbut then “_sang froid_ came back to me, and I gave myself up.” He had\r\nlived the three days without eating and without sleeping. He was very\r\nemotional over what he had done, but he began to work and asked that he\r\nbe sent back.\r\n\r\nHis mother had been very nervous. There was a marked facial asymmetry\r\nand faulty arrangement of teeth. The man was not alcoholic.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mallet, in these cases of fugue, and in other cases of\r\nabsolute delirium of apparently sudden onset, there is a feeling of\r\nmoral and physical discomfort for some days before the outbreak. The\r\noutbreak itself is sudden on the occasion of some idea, either an\r\nobsession or a hallucination. Of all the prodromal signs, headache is\r\nthe most striking. According to Mallet, such fugues are the expression\r\nof a mental imbalance allied to the onirism of Régis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAprosexia and bird-like movements.\r\n\r\n=Case 446.= (CHAVIGNY, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier of the dragoons, 25, entered Chavigny’s service May 30, 1915.\r\nHe acted like a mechanical figure, requiring guidance. The face was\r\nwithout expression except for the mobile eyes, and sudden bird-like\r\nmovements of the head, continually attracted to new noises and objects.\r\nAn interlocutor was glanced at but not responded to. If an intense\r\nelectrical shock was passed through his abdomen, for example, the man\r\nwould look for a moment in that direction, but only the most fugitive\r\ndefence reaction would be made, and the stimulus could be repeated with\r\nthe same result, a moment later.\r\n\r\nAfter three days, this aprosexia began to clear, and in four or five\r\ndays, answers to questions and ordinary associations set in. Memory\r\nreappeared. It seems that he had been in concealment in the loft of a\r\nbarn, when he saw his commanding officer carried by, having lost an\r\narm and a leg. He lost consciousness and fell three meters, through\r\nthe trapdoor of the loft. There was thus a combination of trauma\r\nand emotional shock. No external lesion was produced in the fall.\r\nHis memory showed a very sharply defined gap for the period of his\r\naprosexia with the bird-like movements, of eight days, and his memory\r\nwas perfectly good up to the time of the fall. This is one of five\r\ncases observed by Chavigny, who remarks that there is something in\r\nthe attitude of the young child which recalls the aprosexia of these\r\npatients. (Perhaps the phrase of James, “buzzing, blooming confusion”\r\nmight be used.) One must go back to a period in the child’s development\r\nwhen he is not yet able to smile or keep his glance fixed on a shining\r\nobject. On the whole, the resemblance is closer to the attitude of\r\ncertain caged birds.\r\n\r\n_Re_ aprosexia and bird-like movements, see discussion under Case 353.\r\nSee also Case 334.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; unconsciousness (45 days): Mutism (monosymptomatic).\r\n\r\n=Case 447.= (LIÉBAULT, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 32, had a large caliber shell burst one meter from him\r\nSeptember 26, 1915, lost consciousness and remained comatose 45 days.\r\nHe then got progressively better but did not recover speech. He was\r\nneither blind nor deaf. He was examined at the neurological center\r\nat Nantes and there Mirallié called him a case of hysterical mutism,\r\nfinding no paralytic disorder of any sort and finding the patient able\r\nto write his story, to read and to understand what he read, but without\r\nmuch power of retention. He was placed in the phonetic reëducation\r\nservice March 30, but made no progress. In the effort to speak the\r\npatient made strong generalized contractions, including contractions\r\nof his face and winking of his eyes, contractions of the jaw, and\r\nmovements of the neck muscles. In fact, he seemed to be agitated by\r\na sort of cervico-facial tic, and sometimes, although not always, he\r\nsucceeded in getting out a loud voice sound, in which one could imagine\r\nthe syllable that he was trying to utter.\r\n\r\nIn this case the mutism was evidently secondary to motor disorder.\r\nIt is an example of functional dyskinesia (Benon). As long as this\r\nfunctional dyskinesia remains, the patient will not speak. The\r\nrespiratory muscles are disordered, since the respiratory capacity does\r\nnot go over 3 liters. This approaches the normal, however, and if the\r\nsubject cannot speak it is because his diaphragm is subject to jerky or\r\ncramplike movements and because the lips and tongue do not execute the\r\nproper movements either for sounds, syllables or words. Such a patient\r\ncannot protrude the tongue or even bring it beyond the teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion: Recurrent amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 448.= (MAIRET AND PIÉRON, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA shock case of Mairet and Piéron had a disorder of memory.\r\nAssociation paths were open one day and closed the next. Subjected to\r\nshell-shock, September 18, 1915, he was found wandering in the woods\r\na few days later, having completely lost his memory, even for his\r\nname. In November he recovered his surname but not his given name. On\r\nstimulation he was gotten to remember his city, his father, the street,\r\nand the like. Shortly he could get back his memories more quickly;\r\nafter a week it took only 35 seconds to remember that he was born at\r\nParis. However, his recollection of the Trocadero and of the Eiffel\r\nTower, which had come back to him in November, 1915, was lost again\r\nin April, 1916, to return once more in August. December, 1915, he\r\ncould not write to dictation, but copied writing as he would a design.\r\nHe suddenly felt himself able to write in the Morse code (he was a\r\ntelegrapher); then ordinary writing returned. February, 1916, however,\r\nhe had forgotten what the Morse code was. In April, he was taught\r\nnumbers. One day he would know left from right, but had forgotten it by\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion: Comrade killed: Amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 449.= (GAUPP, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nF. K., a 23-year old soldier, in civil life a turner, of Polish\r\ndescent, and of a somewhat nervous and easily excitable disposition,\r\nearly in August went from Strassburg into the Vosges and Lorraine. On\r\nthe 26th a number of shells exploded near him. The troop was excited\r\nand took refuge in a cellar. K.’s best friend was torn to pieces by a\r\nshell. When his body was removed, K. felt sick and lost consciousness.\r\nHe arrived at the clinic in Tübingen in a stuporous condition, by\r\nhospital train, on August 31, 1914. He walked weakly to his bed,\r\nsupported by two men, and lay in the bed, apathetic and reacting to\r\nquestions only with a stare. Things put in his mouth were swallowed. He\r\nremained motionless.\r\n\r\nNext evening he answered a low _Yes_ to a nurse’s question about\r\neating. A little afterwards he said he supposed he was a prisoner in\r\nthe enemy’s country. A little later he got properly oriented but still\r\ndid not know how he had come. September 2, however, he was much clearer\r\nand said he had awakened out of a long dream. There was a complete\r\namnesia, however, from the moment when he went to help remove the torn\r\nbody of his friend up to September 1. Memories became clearer for the\r\nperiod before the shell explosion. The patient became very lively,\r\ntalking vividly of war experiences, imitating shell hissing with an\r\nexpression of intense anxiety, getting accustomed to battle scenes,\r\nsaying that he was now seeing everything again as if real. He remained\r\nanxious for some days, complaining of weight on his chest and of\r\nfeelings of internal restlessness and tension.\r\n\r\nAmnesia for the period of August 26 to September 1 remained; all that\r\nK. could add to the story of those days was that he had been thrown\r\nsidewise for some distance by the air pressure of the shell.\r\n\r\nFrom September 6 onwards, he grew calmer but he was still very labile,\r\ngiven to lively imaginings and emotion. By the middle of September he\r\nwas well and discharged for garrison duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-explosion: Recurrent amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 450.= (MAIRET AND PIÉRON, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA man, 33, had suffered shell-shock early in December, 1914. His\r\nintervening history is not reported, but he showed on admission to the\r\nservice of Mairet and Piéron, May 5, 1915, a remarkable amnesia. There\r\nwas a complete cutaneous anesthesia, anosmia, and ageusia, and he was\r\nmute. He lived only in the specious present. His previous life was\r\ncompletely abolished for him. He could dress himself, eat, use a fork\r\nand spoon, and a glass. He understood ordinary words; such words as\r\nman, woman, day and night, however had no meaning. He was observed for\r\n15 months and presented four phases.\r\n\r\nIn phase one, there was a measure of success in reëducation, such that\r\nhe grew able to recognize a few persons, to find his bed, and name\r\nobjects. He was got to copy writing, to learn the alphabet, and to say\r\na few words. He could not write from dictation, however. Less than two\r\nseconds after looking at an _A_, he had forgotten how it looked and\r\ncould not trace it. This first phase lasted about two months.\r\n\r\nThe second phase began with fatigue, headaches, and the rather quick\r\neffacement of all he had relearned. If an errand was given him to do,\r\nhe would run to do it before he should forget it; but if the trip\r\nrequired more than 4 or 5 seconds, he had to stop, not knowing what to\r\ndo with the thing in his hands. He was still able to recognize 4 or\r\n5 persons, but could add no more to his repertoire; and when one of\r\nthem had been absent for a fortnight, he did not recognize him on his\r\nreturn. He could not remember the time for his meals.\r\n\r\nThe third phase was ushered in by improvement after vomiting; his\r\nspeech came back in a feeble voice, November 16, 11 months after the\r\nshock. Reëducation could now be undertaken again. He easily relearned\r\na number of things, feeling the greatest astonishment at his new\r\nacquirements as to the sun and the moon, the trees and the flowers, and\r\nthe like. He expressed a curiosity to see his own home, but when he\r\nwent thither, he could recognize nothing. He wanted to get back home,\r\nnamely to the hospital where he had lived all his life; where, in fact,\r\nhe had been born from the psychic point of view.\r\n\r\nAt this time began the fourth phase, April, 1916--a phase of decline\r\nonce more, in which a large portion of his acquisitions were again lost\r\nand he fell back to his condition in the second phase.\r\n\r\nSee discussion under Case 353 and under Case 367. _Re_ confusional\r\nmental states, Roussy and Lhermitte, after distinguishing stuporous\r\nconfusion from simple confusion, go on to differentiate what they call\r\nobtusion (see also discussion under Case 353). These authors say that\r\nRégis, in common with most psychiatrists, fails to distinguish the slow\r\nthinking and amnesia of true mental confusion from the temporal and\r\nthe spatial disorientation that characterize the so-called obtusion.\r\nOf course, in all attacks of confusion, both attention and memory are\r\naffected, but there are special types in which attention defects and\r\nmemory defects stand out in relief. The first of these types is the\r\naprosexic type with birdlike movements, described by Chavigny (see for\r\nan example, Case 446). This aprosexia may be combined with mutism,\r\ndeafness, or convulsions. The form of confusional disease in which\r\namnesia is the out-standing feature is due to toxic or infectious\r\ndisease, or is a Korsakow phenomenon, _i.e._, in the psychiatry of\r\npeace times; but the war has brought out amnestic confusion in other\r\nstates than the toxic, infectious, and alcoholic states (Régis,\r\nChavigny, Dumas, Roussy and Lhermitte). The amnesia may be incomplete,\r\na sort of dysmnesia, or twilight memory, but as a rule, the amnesia\r\nis lacunar. The toxic and infectious amnestic confusions have a loss\r\nof memory for events following the onset, but these war cases of\r\namnestic confusion have the loss of memory running back far into the\r\npatient’s past, slipping from the mind his name, his parentage, age,\r\nand vocation. Instead of being like the toxic confusional amnesia, an\r\nanterograde amnesia of fixation, the Shell-shock amnesia is apt to be\r\nantero-retrograde. These antero-retrograde amnesias, whether due to\r\nemotion or to strong physical shock, may sometimes leave in sharp\r\nrelief the recollection of the shock or event itself which initiated\r\nthe amnesia. Meanwhile the patient does not forget automatic actions\r\nof dressing, reading, writing, and the like. The amnesia may be very\r\nselective, imitating aphasia, word blindness, letter blindness,\r\nagraphia, and the like. All this is part of the hallucinatory form of\r\nmental confusion which Régis describes as oniric delirium (see for\r\noniric delirium, discussion under Case 333).\r\n\r\nLépine distinguishes amongst the confusions, five forms as follows:\r\nSimple confusion, hallucinatory confusion, acute delirium, stuporous\r\nconfusion (under which Lépine also considers the battle hypnosis of\r\nMilian, see Case 365, and Roussy’s narcolepsy), and amnestic confusion.\r\nAll these phenomena from the clinical point of view are connected\r\nwith an acute and fleeting insufficiency of the most delicate or, as\r\nit were, psychic portions of the cerebral cortex, the delirium, so to\r\nspeak, being activity of the unconscious, whereas a confusion is due to\r\na clouding of the centre O of Grasset’s polygon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoldier’s heart, both neurotic and organic.\r\n\r\n=Case 451.= (MACCURDY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA territorial, 19, who had enlisted in January 1914, reached France\r\nin September, 1916. He was of neurotic make-up (night terrors, fear\r\nof dark, giddiness in high places, fear of tunnels, enuresis until 10\r\nyears, worry about seminal emissions), and had always had a tendency\r\nto short wind. Enlisting at 16, he found it hard carrying his pack\r\nat first but soon grew stronger. The trench life was distasteful.\r\nHe began to wish that he might be killed, or at all events removed\r\nfrom the trenches. Pains developed under the heart, with shortness of\r\nbreath, palpitation, dizziness, and faint feelings. The man connected\r\nthese heart symptoms with what he called his weakness of gall bladder\r\n(namely, enuresis). He was several times sent off duty for heart\r\ntreatment. After three months in and out of hospital, he got trench\r\nfoot, was sent to England, and transferred to a special heart hospital.\r\nHere the pulse test was positive, in that the rate did not diminish as\r\nit normally does after two minutes’ rest. After graduated exercises for\r\nseveral months, the pulse test had become negative and the heart had\r\ngradually improved from the organic standpoint. The patient, however,\r\ninsisted that his heart trouble was as bad as ever, and was probably\r\nconsciously hoping that his symptoms might persist.\r\n\r\n_Re_ soldier’s heart, Abrahams classifies cases that come to the\r\nmilitary surgeon for heart symptoms as (_a_) functional fatigue cases;\r\n(_b_) nicotine and drug cases; (_c_) organic heart disease and Graves’\r\ndisease; (_d_) the true soldier’s heart, occurring in men with a\r\nneurasthenic soil that lose control of the vasomotors and inhibitors of\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoldiers heart, neurotic.\r\n\r\n=Case 452.= (MACCURDY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn Australian gunner, 35, of a neurotic make-up (night terrors; horror\r\nof blood; fear of thunderstorms, high places, tunnels, horses; shy with\r\nboth sexes), benefited by military training physically, but remained as\r\nneurotic as ever. On the way to his first service in Egypt, he feared\r\nshipwreck, and in Egypt was troubled by the weather and occasional\r\npalpitations and sinking feelings. He was transferred to the French\r\nfront, May, 1916. He was terrified and depressed under shell fire, and\r\nhorrified by blood. Peculiar sinking sensations or feelings that the\r\nsoul was leaving the body came to him as he was going off to sleep;\r\nfrom which he woke at times with sudden starts. Later he had nightmares\r\nof things, mainly shells, falling on him. He worried, wanted death, and\r\nthought of suicide. In May, 1917, he was blown off his feet by a shell.\r\nThereafter he began to feel that shells were being especially aimed at\r\nhim, and four days later got a pain in the side, and began to tremble\r\nand breathe with difficulty, as if his throat were swelled up and he\r\nwere going to choke. He ascribed this to gas. The bombardier finally\r\nsent him back to a hospital, where he grew weaker and screamed aloud\r\non being awakened by his dreams. After six weeks in a special heart\r\nhospital, all the symptoms cleared up except the choking feelings and\r\nfear of instant death. Organically the man appeared normal. An initial\r\npulse of 96 ran up to 168 after exercise, and down to 84 after two\r\nminutes’ rest.\r\n\r\n_Re_ soldier’s heart, Abrahams speaks of sundry hypotheses that he\r\nregards as erroneous. Soldier’s heart has been thought to be (_a_)\r\nathlete’s heart; others regard it as (_b_) a toxemic condition,\r\npossibly of bacterial origin; (_c_) hyperthyroidism (a larval form\r\nof Graves’ disease has been incriminated); (_d_) excessive cigarette\r\nsmoking; and (_e_) deficiency of buffer salts in the blood, have been\r\nproposed by other authors.\r\n\r\nGallavardin has especially studied the tachycardial cases revealed by\r\nthe war, cases in which auscultation is frequently unable to detect\r\naught. These tachycardiacs are often hypertensive. Sedentary service\r\nshould be found for them.\r\n\r\n_Re_ pulse 168 after exercise, Gallavardin found 8 per cent of 500\r\nnon-organic and non-tuberculous cases to run up from 150 to 175 (125\r\nto 150 in 27 per cent; 100 to 125 in 37 per cent; 75 to 100 in 26 per\r\ncent; 50 to 75 in 2 per cent).\r\n\r\n_Re_ cardiac neuroses, Brasch points out that cardiac neuroses in\r\nthe male in war time have found a strange new association with\r\nhyperesthesia of the skin. The patients showed dermatographia and\r\nhyperreflexia. The hyperesthetic zones of Head and Mackenzie were found\r\nby Brasch in all cases of organic cardiac disease, but also in two\r\ncases of cardiac neurosis in hysterics.\r\n\r\nMoore calls attention to somewhat similar phenomena in the somatic\r\ngroup of nervous and depressed cases found in the war. These patients\r\nare fatigued, exhausted, sleepless, tremulous, vascular, and cardiac\r\ncases, with dermatographia, areas of paresthesia, and pains in the\r\nneighborhood of wound scars.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar Strain; Shell-shock: Hysteria (question of malingering).\r\n\r\n=Case 453.= (MYERS, March, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant, 32, with 11 years’ service and eight months’ service in\r\nFrance, was admitted to a base hospital for inquiry as to possible\r\nmalingering. It seems that he had taught in an army school for seven\r\nyears before the war. He found heavy marches in France too much for him\r\nand fainted in the retreat from Mons and during the fighting on the\r\nAisne, where he had reported sick for dysentery. The field ambulance\r\nwhere he was treated was near the shell fire, and a shell knocked him\r\ninto a ditch. The ambulance had to move to a cave. Thereafter the\r\npatient suffered from tremor when spoken to or when watched. After\r\ndischarge, he was employed as a dispatch rider on a motor cycle, but\r\nafter three months lost his nerve for this work and took charge of\r\nfatigue parties. He found the work too much for him. He had been a\r\ntotal abstainer. Finally the malingering charge was brought up.\r\n\r\nThe patient was nervous, delicate-looking, with widely dilated pupils,\r\nprominent eyeballs, tremor of right arm, and pulse of 102. The tremor\r\nwas markedly lessened when he was alone, and was somewhat under\r\ncontrol. He felt that his memory was defective, and tests demonstrated\r\nthe defect.\r\n\r\nIn hospital patient slept better, the pupils grew smaller, the pulse\r\nrate diminished. There was a reduction in sensibility to pain over the\r\nright side of the head and body and over the right limbs. A prick of\r\nthe right arm or leg was described as a finger touch. There was also\r\nalmost complete hemi-anosmia and complete hemi-ageusia on the right\r\nside. Visual acuity was diminished on the right, and there was general\r\nlimitation of right field; left-sided vision and field normal.\r\n\r\nAfter a month in hospital at home and two months’ leave, the patient\r\nwas discharged no longer physically fit for service. He is now weak\r\nphysically and mentally, subject to severe headaches, and tremulous,\r\nespecially in the right arm, when tired.\r\n\r\n_Re_ malingering, Sicard denies the existence of unconscious\r\nmalingerers (presumably regarding this phrase as a figure of speech\r\nin relation to hysteria), and divides malingering into a creative and\r\nan acquired form. The _simulateur de création_ assumes attitudes and\r\nsymptoms to attract attention or pity; the _simulateurs de fixation_\r\nhaving been sick in the beginning, perpetuate their disease, in brief,\r\ncrystallize their neuroses. The _fixateur_ may be very realistic in\r\nall this, seeing that he has known from his own experience what a real\r\ndisease is. The formula runs: The _simulateur de création_ improvises;\r\nthe _simulateur de fixation_ repeats.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mott, malingering in the form of an assumed Shell-shock is\r\nnot uncommon amongst soldiers, and is rather hard to distinguish from a\r\nneurosis developing on the basis of an _idée fixe_.\r\n\r\nBallet’s definition of simulation is “a subjective or objective\r\ndisorder which the patient invents with the idea of voluntarily and\r\nconsciously misleading the observer.” Closely related to simulation\r\nis exaggeration or prolongation, conscious or intentional, of a real\r\ndisorder. Babinski states that cases of genuine simulation are very\r\nrare, and that the subject under suspicion should be given the benefit\r\nof the doubt. Especially the word _simulation_, or similar words,\r\nshould not be uttered in the presence of the patient. Practically\r\nspeaking, psychotherapy applied as in cases of hysteria may often cure\r\nthe simulator and the exaggerator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe officer who could not kick.\r\n\r\n=Case 454.= (MILLS, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn officer had had a bullet in the right calf, of which nothing was\r\nevident months later but small scars of entrance and exit. Nevertheless\r\nhe complained of pain, especially after walking, and of inability to\r\ndorsiflex the foot beyond a certain point. No wasting could be found\r\nand no impairment of sensation. The muscles were faradically normal.\r\nMills thought the symptoms were exaggerated and so remarked to the\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nUnder anesthesia, however, the dorsiflexion also proved to be\r\nimpossible, and after exerting considerable force, Dr. Dunhill was\r\nable to rupture a massive fibrous band of adhesions that had prevented\r\nextension. The officer made a good recovery.\r\n\r\nDr. Mills confessed his error to the officer who had naturally resented\r\nthe suggestion of malingering. The officer forgave him.\r\n\r\n_Re_ malingering, Moore states that no diagnosis of malingering should\r\nbe made without the most careful examination and consideration of the\r\nindividual as such, on account of the fact that the erroneous diagnosis\r\ndejects the patient and postpones recovery. It is particularly unwise\r\nto term the trouble “imaginary,” or to talk about “suggestion” or use\r\nsimilar terms in the presence of the patient.\r\n\r\nCraig has found very few cases of actual malingering and states that\r\ntremors and paroxysms are often mistaken therefor. Bispham remarks that\r\nfew malingerers are found among the patients of a doctor who is known\r\nto be a thorough examiner.\r\n\r\n_Re_ orthopedic cases like Case 454, Gleboff remarks upon the\r\nsimulation of joint affections and upon methods of surprising the\r\nmalingerers into sudden movements made in obedience to request in the\r\ncourse of medical examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubtful accounts by patient concerning arm palsy: Incorrect diagnosis\r\nof simulation.\r\n\r\n=Case 455.= (VOSS, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA volunteer, 18, just before the war had a fall in which apparently he\r\ninjured his skull. In December, 1914, he hurt his left forearm. About\r\nthis injury he sometimes said he fell in a storming attack in a trench\r\nand broke his arm, and again he said his arm had been smashed by stones\r\nfrom a falling house. From that time forward there was paralysis of the\r\nleft forearm with flexor contracture. May, 1915, slight hypesthesia\r\ncould be demonstrated on the ulnar side of the arm, suggesting ulnaris\r\ninjury. There were, however, no considerable electrical changes.\r\n\r\nSix months later the man was sent up with a suspicion of simulation.\r\nIn the meantime the contracture had resolved and there was a typical\r\nhysterical paralysis with all signs of neurosis. Six months later he\r\nwas well enough to be examined for military service.\r\n\r\nHere was a case in which the incorrect data offered by the patient\r\nhimself as to the origin of his paralysis gave rise to the suspicion\r\nof simulation, whereas, as a matter of fact, the man was clearly\r\nhysterical.\r\n\r\n_Re_ incorrect data supplied by the patient to his own disadvantage,\r\nLumsden remarks on the great difficulty of diagnosis in cases where\r\nhysteria and malingering have been combined, and Morselli states that,\r\nif the doctor has really made up his mind that the man is shamming, he\r\nshould send him back to the fighting line at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nForearm wound: Hysterical edema?\r\n\r\n=Case 456.= (LEBAR, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA corporal, 26, formerly a farmer, was struck in the forearm by a\r\nshell fragment on the mid-portion of the radial border. The wound was\r\nslight (the fragment entering and emerging hardly 2 cm. apart) but\r\nbled profusely, according to the patient, who was evacuated next day\r\nbut one to a hospital in the interior. By this time the right hand was\r\nswollen, nor could any movement of hand or fingers be made. Massage,\r\nmechanotherapy, passive movements did no good.\r\n\r\nThe man entered the neurological center of the Eighth Region, July\r\n7, 1915, when there were already a few skin changes with dorsal\r\nthinning and palmar thickening. There was cutaneous anesthesia not\r\nonly of hand and fingers but of the forearm to the elbow, and this\r\nanesthesia included heat and cold. Position sense was preserved. There\r\nwas no evidence of atrophy except for the skin changes. An electrical\r\nexamination showed normal conditions.\r\n\r\nJuly 13, a sealed bandage was put on, but at the end of five days\r\nthe hand looked as before. July 19, a new treatment was announced to\r\nthe patient. With a hot needle a number of pricks were made on the\r\ndorsal surface of the hand and a few c.c. of fluid were withdrawn\r\n(containing a slight amount of albumin and a few lymphocytes),\r\nwhereupon a dry bandage was put on. The next day a few finger and\r\nthumb flexion movements could be made and sensation had returned.\r\nSensation completely returned July 21. The flexion movements were still\r\nincomplete, by reason of the edema and dryness of the skin. However,\r\nJuly 22, flexion was better and the swelling had gone down sixty per\r\ncent. Jacquet’s biokinetic treatment (active gymnastics of the hand\r\nand fingers) was given for four hours. July 25, the edema had greatly\r\ndiminished and normal motion had returned.\r\n\r\nExamination excluded renal disease. There was no sign indicating\r\nphlegmon. Quincke’s disease had other features. Fraudulent application\r\nof a bandage might be considered, but the course of the disease under\r\nsealed conditions seems to exclude this hypothesis also. May it,\r\ntherefore, not be a case of hysterical edema?\r\n\r\n_Re_ hysterical edema, see remarks under Case 407. In the case above,\r\nof Lebar, Babinski calls attention to the fact that the edema and the\r\ncontracture diminished though they did not entirely disappear after\r\nthe scarifications. This physical treatment did not act, according to\r\nBabinski, wholly as a matter of suggestion, and he fears that some\r\ncases of so-called hysterical edema are really cases of physiopathic\r\nvasomotor disorder; in fact, three of the cases published (and amongst\r\nthem, the present case of Lebar), were cases of edema associated with\r\ncontracture and developing in an injured limb. To prove a case of\r\nanything to be hysterical is, of course, according to the Babinski\r\nschool, to submit it to a therapeutic test and cure it by suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell splinters in head: Suspicion of (_a_) simulation, (_b_) hysteria.\r\nCase actually surgical.\r\n\r\n=Case 457.= (VOSS, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man, injured by shell fragments in the head and sustaining fracture\r\nof both arms and a thigh, got well of his wounds, but fell into a\r\nnervous state with headache and dizziness. He was given prolonged\r\nobservation psychiatrically and then sent back to the front as fit for\r\nservice, but was shortly returned to hospital and sent to Cologne under\r\nthe suspicion of simulation.\r\n\r\nThe picture was of unilateral increase of tendon reflexes, accelerated\r\npulse, disorder in the intake of ideas, difficulty in finding words and\r\ndelayed associations. His gait suggested a psychogenic disorder. X-ray\r\nshowed two shell fragments in the vault of the skull.\r\n\r\nAccording to Voss, it is a sad fact that victims of skull injuries\r\nare frequently charged with simulation or exaggeration. In the above\r\ninstance, moreover, this charge was undoubtedly inaccurate.\r\n\r\n_Re_ simulation, see remarks under Case 453. _Re_ neurological cases,\r\nthe Neurological Society of Paris sent to the War Ministry a special\r\nnote pointing out how tardy was the reference of sundry neurological\r\ncases to the special neurological service. They pointed out how\r\nimportant it was to send to these special services all cases of bullet\r\nand shrapnel lesions.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the malingering question, there is a wide divergence of opinion,\r\neven amongst experienced workers in the same city. The late Professor\r\nDejerine said he had not seen a single case of malingering. In fact,\r\nhe thought that malingering amongst soldiers and amongst injured\r\nindustrial workers had been much exaggerated. Marie, however, working\r\nin the examination of many surgical cases, found malingering relatively\r\ncommon. Amongst forty of his cases, he regarded at least nine as\r\nmalingerers or exaggerators.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sciatica,” torticollis, stiff arm: The desire to avoid active service\r\nplus functional disease.\r\n\r\n=Case 458.= (COLLIE, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA man enlisted September, 1914, went to France after six months’\r\ntraining, immediately put himself on sick list, and was admitted to\r\na base hospital: Diagnosis, sciatica. Later, he ceased complaining\r\nof sciatica and developed spastic torticollis. He was sent back to\r\nEngland, was treated with radiant heat and so on, and was eventually\r\nsent to the Royal Bath Hospital at Harrowgate.\r\n\r\nHe recovered from torticollis after six weeks’ treatment; but then\r\ndeveloped a spasmodic contracture of the right shoulder and forearm.\r\nHe was massaged for this and also given high frequency treatment. Then\r\ncame two transfers (massage).\r\n\r\nEarly in December, 1915, he came under Collie’s observation. He then\r\nshowed right wrist bent at right angles to the forearm; hand tightly\r\nclenched, so firmly that it seemed as if the wrist were ankylosed.\r\nThe case was obviously a functional one. The man refused to enter\r\nhospital at Collie’s suggestion. He was sent to the Maida Vale\r\nHospital. Previously he tried to persuade the medical officer that\r\nfurther hospital treatment was unnecessary, stating that he was now\r\nable to straighten his arm and that he was applying a splint to keep it\r\nstraight. He progressed slowly in the institution. Told, if he would\r\nrecover within fourteen days, he would be classified “for home service\r\nonly”--before the fourteen days were up, he had suspended his weight on\r\na trapeze and pulled himself up to his chin on it; had also lifted a\r\n28-lb. weight with his paralyzed hand. In short, he wholly recovered.\r\nHe is now doing duty with his unit.\r\n\r\nCollie says this is not deliberate malingering but a mixture of\r\nfunctional disease and an obvious desire to avoid active service. When\r\nhe appeared before the board for a final decision, there was a tendency\r\nto assume the old paralyzed position until he was sharply called to\r\norder, when his arm assumed normal position.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion_: The direct personal treatment of his mental condition and\r\nan appeal to his lower instincts were immediately curative and of much\r\nmore value than the radiant heat or high frequency treatment.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Collie’s case, Russel finds surprisingly large numbers of\r\nmalingerers; he found many at the time of the battles at Loos. It was\r\nparticularly easy in cases of epilepsy to demonstrate a close relation\r\nbetween hysteria and malingering. In the psychogenesis of these\r\nconditions, Russel emphasizes the initial element of deception, which\r\nsoon enormously increases either through the patient’s convictions of\r\nhis ability to deceive or through a process of autosuggestion. Cases of\r\nsemi-malingering are not uncommon. In England, Russel found more cases\r\nof a clearly psychogenic nature; yet in these, also, there was always\r\nprimarily an element of deception.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes-No test of value _re_ anesthesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 459.= (MILLS, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nThe “Yes-No” test proved of special value in the case of an Australian\r\nprivate. Shortly after landing at Gallipoli this man had a bullet graze\r\nhis ankle and fell some thirty feet over the bow of a ridge. He was\r\npicked up unable to move his legs and insensitive therein.\r\n\r\nThe paraplegia and anesthesia lasted three months. “Fracture\r\ndislocation of the dorsal spine” was the diagnosis made, and\r\nlaminectomy was even contemplated. The sphincter reflex was normal and\r\nthere was no atrophy, no rigidity and no reflex disorder. Asked to say\r\n“no” when he could not feel a pin-prick and “yes” when he did feel it,\r\nhe replied “no” to each prick to the anesthetic area and changed his\r\nreply to “yes” when the sensitive parts of the body were examined. At\r\nanother time the answers were found not to correspond with those given\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe soldier was assured that he would get well and that as soon as he\r\ncould walk he would be boarded and returned to Australia.\r\n\r\nAfter a number of weeks he became able to walk.\r\n\r\n\r\nArabian fever.\r\n\r\n=Case 460.= (ROUSSY, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn Arab fell on his knee, one day in the trenches. A contracture of the\r\nleft arm, with great pain, and a temperature of 38 to 40 degrees, with\r\nhemoptysis, developed. This man had been considered tuberculous. One\r\nday, however, the thermometer went up to 41 degrees. It was discovered\r\nthat he took artificial means to push the mercury up, and that the\r\nspitting of blood was voluntary. All these phenomena disappeared after\r\nhe was put in the guardhouse for 24 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nShrapnel scratch of head: Hysterical amaurosis “?” On isolation in a\r\ndark room, the patient began to see light!\r\n\r\n=Case 461.= (BRIAND and KALT, February, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man may seek to exaggerate an anomaly of his eye which had existed\r\nbefore the war, in order to live comfortably far from the front.\r\n\r\nA soldier sustained a slight scratch from a shrapnel bullet in front\r\nof the left ear, which scarred over in a few days. The soldier said,\r\nhowever, that the bullet had gone through his skull and a few hours\r\nafter his wound said he could not see. Sent to the hospital he\r\ncontinued to say he was blind and finally brought up in an asylum for\r\nthe blind near Lyons where he was taught to cane chairs and to write in\r\nBraille. This happened in July, 1915.\r\n\r\nIn October he was sent to the Hospital at Quinze-Vingt where a\r\ndiagnosis of hysterical amaurosis was made with a large interrogation\r\npoint. He was then sent to Brequet where there was a section reserved\r\nfor disciplinary cases and very nervous cases not wanting to get well,\r\na service under the charge of Roubinowitch.\r\n\r\nThe soldier escaped with a comrade and eventually reached Val-de-Grâce\r\nwhere the diagnosis of hysterical amaurosis was again made.\r\nExaminations several times showed that there was nothing abnormal\r\nabout the eyes except that the eyelids presented habitual fibrillary\r\nmovements (antebellum).\r\n\r\nThe eyelids passively opened, would remain open for a few minutes and\r\nthen close. There was no winking of the eye to a light, yet the pupil\r\npreserved its reflex power.\r\n\r\nVision was abolished, however, the soldier said. He was without any\r\nother motor or sensory disorder. Much sympathy was given to the poor\r\nblind soldier. People were much astonished when the chief of the\r\nophthalmological service had the man isolated in a dark room. Three\r\nweeks later the man had begun to see the light a little. A week later\r\nthe eyes remained open without the necessity of having the lids raised\r\nby the fingers, and vision returned.\r\n\r\n_Re_ amaurosis, Parsons explains the blindness which may remain after\r\nconsciousness returns following Shell-shock, as a condition in which\r\nthe lower visual paths are carrying on their functions normally. For\r\nexample, the pupillary reactions are preserved. The condition is not\r\nunlike that found in amaurosis of uremia, and Parsons has found it\r\nin children with posterior basic meningitis. For Parsons, therefore,\r\nthe block occurs in the higher centers above the thalamus, possibly\r\nin the synapses of the optic radiation fibers. Ormond states that the\r\ntrue cases of concussion blindness invariably pass through phases of\r\ngreat discomfort; whereas the malingerers are without such discomfort.\r\nMedical suggestion, also, has a powerful effect here, and may actually\r\nretard recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nA newspaper cure.\r\n\r\n=Case 462.= (SICARD, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nSicard read in a French newspaper a story to the effect that, at two\r\no’clock in the afternoon, a soldier had fallen on the sidewalk between\r\nNos. 40 and 42 Boulevard de Liberté, in a nervous crisis. The people\r\nran and picked him up. When he came to, he was very joyful, perceiving\r\nthat the shock had given him back his speech, which he had lost the\r\nAugust previous. This soldier, the newspaper continued, became deafmute\r\nthrough the explosion of a bomb in a fight in Upper Alsace. “The brave\r\nsoldier is most happy over the unexpected result.” The newspaper went\r\non, “We congratulate him sincerely, as well as the people who assisted\r\nhim.” He was the more contented that he had gotten well because, the\r\nsoldier said, he would now be able to go back among his comrades to\r\nfight with the Boches!\r\n\r\nNow, in point of fact, Sicard had dealt with this soldier the morning\r\nof the day in question. He had been simulating mutism for ten months,\r\nand finally told Sicard that he would like to leave that afternoon\r\nas he felt cure coming. Sometime after, he wrote a letter of profuse\r\nthanks for the benefits received, and said he did not deserve to avoid\r\ncourt-martial. He also said that he was going to do everything he could\r\nto justify himself. Incidentally, he kept his word and an officer in\r\nhis regiment later gave him an enthusiastic recommendation.\r\n\r\n_Re_ malingering, see discussion concerning _simulateurs de création_\r\nand _simulateurs de fixation_ under Case 453.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeafmutism: Explained by patient as malingering.\r\n\r\n=Case 463.= (MYERS, September, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA pure malingerer, of set purpose, initiates a quasipathological\r\ncondition which he will discard when he has gained his end or when he\r\nis assured that he is unobserved. Malingering in the field of speech\r\nis rare. A private, 26, one year in service, three months in France,\r\nentered a base hospital, deafmute for nine weeks. He wrote: “I should\r\nbe very happy if you can do anything for me. I cannot give a very clear\r\naccount of what happened, as it is sometime since. I remember retiring\r\nfrom Hill ---- with some more to some trenches, and in the open we\r\nwere shelled and I lost touch with our chaps or else they were killed.\r\nI remember a great concussion and finding myself on the ground, and a\r\nsoldier dragged me up and we ran for the trench. I was very thirsty and\r\nI ran down the trench to get some water. I met one of our chaps and\r\ntried to ask him for some, and I could not make him understand. He only\r\nsmiled at me. The man who picked me up took me to an officer who was\r\nsitting on the edge of the trench and tried to make me understand, and\r\nthen he sent me with this man to a dressing station, and from there I\r\nhave been to different places, the names of which I do not know, except\r\nthe last place, No. -- Convalescent Camp. I have been there about two\r\nmonths----”\r\n\r\nHe seemed anxious to get well. He could not understand what was said.\r\nInduced anesthesia caused no phase of excitement, and the patient\r\nfailed to regain his speech. He was evacuated to England. Three months\r\nlater the patient thence wrote the following confidential letter from a\r\nConvalescent Home. “Sir,--I regret very much to inform you that I was\r\nimposing upon you.----I may state that I was physically unfit for the\r\nFront.----During the whole time of training my pay was chiefly spent in\r\ntonics and drugs, but I kept going as I was determined to see what it\r\nwas like at the Front.----I have written this----that your ‘notes’ on\r\ncases will not suffer any detrimental effect through my imposture.----I\r\nhave not got my discharge yet, but shall stick out for it. I ‘speak’\r\nbut do not ‘hear’ very well.--” He was in two hospitals for functional\r\nnervous disorders in England, but in neither institution was he\r\nregarded as a malingerer.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hysteria explained by the patient as malingering, Chavigny\r\ndiscusses what he calls _sursimulation_. The physician must not fall\r\ninto a permanent state of suspicion, and especially must not reveal\r\nhis suspicions to the accused or to the bystanders. Chavigny quotes a\r\nFrench soldier whose letter to his wife was intercepted, stating that\r\nhe was going to feign deafmutism to secure his discharge. Before he had\r\nsucceeded in doing so, however, he suffered Shell-shock, and got a true\r\nhysterical deafmutism, which showed no signs of malingering whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeafmutism: Appearance of malingering.\r\n\r\n=Case 464.= (MYERS, September, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA stretcher bearer was seen by Lt.-Col. Myers two days after admission\r\nto a base hospital. Stolid looking and mute, he had nevertheless talked\r\nin his sleep, had written a few words about “shells coming over,”\r\nand understood what was said to him. Lt.-Col. Myers’ notes run, “He\r\nputs out his tongue and closes his eyes and holds out one hand when\r\nI ask him to do so, but gets stupid (as if sulky) when I ask for the\r\nother hand. He _will_ not hear any more. Next day quite deaf, and the\r\nfollowing day light anesthesia with ether caused a return of hearing\r\nand of speech, with repetition of syllables to request on the way to\r\ndeeper anesthesia. On awaking he cried as he was induced to resume his\r\nspeech, and complained of pains in the head.\r\n\r\n“Two days later, he seemed normal and said that he could have spoken\r\non the second day, but that his eyes and ears had begun to swim, that\r\nhe had felt dizzy, and was afraid to talk. He did not want to be sent\r\nback to the trenches. There had been severe shelling. He had lost\r\nconsciousness until he awoke in a hospital at Y--. He recalled, little\r\nby little, how he had been taken back by a corporal to a cellar. He\r\nsaid he wanted to go back, but wanted a rest first. He went back to his\r\nunit and was reported as having done well for four months.”\r\n\r\nThere was a certain suggestion of malingering about the admission of\r\nthe lad that he could have spoken before he was induced to do so.\r\nAccording to Lt.-Col. Myers, a number of patients upon recovery of\r\nspeech are apt falsely to believe that they have been malingering.\r\nFunctional disorders may simulate malingering.\r\n\r\nLannois and Chavanne warn against the suggestions given to malingerers\r\nand to hysterics by the statements on the tickets of admission borne by\r\nthe patients for transfer, _e.g._ “incurable deafness.” These authors\r\nfound 11 per cent malingerers amongst 262 cases of labyrinthine shock.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimulation of deafmutism.\r\n\r\n=Case 465.= (GRADENIGO, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in the mountain artillery acted like a deafmute. He was\r\nunable to read or write. It was reported that he had been wounded, but\r\nno evidence of wound could be found. The man had a low forehead and a\r\nfurtive glance, his whole impression being that of a criminal.\r\n\r\nThe only evidence of disease found was inflammation with perforation of\r\nthe tympanic membrane of the left ear. Deep in the left auditory meatus\r\nwas found _a grain of crushed oats_! The man’s speech difficulty was of\r\na stuttering nature, but he stuttered in a different way at every test.\r\nHe was unwilling to be narcotized. Finally by a process of scolding and\r\ncajoling, the man was made to confess that he could both hear and speak\r\nwell. The peculiar stuttering early led to the diagnosis of simulation,\r\nbut the fact that the tympanic membrane was not anesthetic, and that\r\nthere was no anesthetic zone in the body strengthened the suspicion--to\r\nsay nothing of the refusal of narcosis and the general behavior of the\r\nsomewhat criminal-looking soldier.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lame rascal.\r\n\r\n=Case 466.= (GILLES, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, 28, had an equinovarus, for which he was evacuated,\r\nhospitalized, given treatment, sent home for convalescence, and\r\ndeclared unfit for service. He was, however, sent back to the front,\r\nand on arrival, went lame; whereupon the regimental surgeon sent him\r\nto a nerve center. The equinovarus was there but it was nothing but a\r\nsimple contracture without pain, atrophy, sensory, reflex, electrical,\r\nor X-ray disorders.\r\n\r\nThe abductor muscles were stimulated by electricity and the foot\r\nstraightened. He was kept under observation for a time, was lame no\r\nlonger, and was sent back to his regiment.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometime later he was evacuated again to the same neurological\r\ncenter, stating that he did not know why. There was no longer any varus\r\nor anything abnormal. The rascal had enjoyed the game of going lame and\r\nhad prevailed upon his officers to evacuate him. He then saw that he\r\nwas found out and pretended that he had been forcibly evacuated.\r\n\r\n\r\nMother love and jaundice.\r\n\r\n=Case 467.= (BRIAND and HAURY, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 19½, entered the central psychiatric service at\r\nVal-de-Grâce, having been evacuated from a hospital in Paris, _suspect_\r\nof having brought about a picric acid jaundice. He had been undergoing\r\ntreatment in this hospital, when the physician who had isolated him\r\nfound that he was getting picric acid in packages secreted in his képi.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the soldier lived with his mother, and enlisted when he\r\nwas not yet 18. He proved to be as good a soldier as he was workman,\r\nand came through the campaign without wound or disease. Accordingly, in\r\nDecember, 1915, he got a six-day leave. His mother, who loved him well,\r\nand of whom he was the sole support, had much regretted his enlisting.\r\nShe was sick with some stomach disease and, after he enlisted, she told\r\neverybody that she was going to die and that it was his fault. So,\r\nwhen he came on leave the next day, she asked him to take a powder so\r\nhe might stay a fortnight. She did not tell him the name of the drug;\r\nonly told him how to take it in a small paper, swallowing it with a\r\nlittle water. She said he would become yellow and that he would get a\r\nsupplementary leave. Three days after his return to the front, the boy\r\ntook three of the ten powders; took the same number three or four days\r\nlater; and the others five or six days later. He soon had jaundice with\r\ncolic and diarrhea, and apparently was exempted from service for a few\r\ndays. He had returned to the front hardly a month when his mother died\r\nand the boy got another six-day leave for the funeral. He took ten\r\nfresh doses of picric acid while at Paris, and was put into hospital by\r\na physician without suspicion. His relatives thought he was suffering\r\nfrom a recurrent jaundice. When the story was told, the boy confessed\r\nto the family, and said that he had taken the drug in the first place\r\nonly to please his mother. It is harder to explain the second trial,\r\nsince he talked about the compassion and sense of obedience he felt to\r\nhis dead mother. It is probable that he simply wanted a prolonged leave\r\nat Paris.\r\n\r\n_Re_ malingering, Blum speaks of fictitious jaundice as having received\r\nthe name of _La Carotte_ (the carrot) from the soldiers. Blum gives a\r\npartial list of instances of simulation as follows:\r\n\r\nSIMULATION\r\n\r\n(BLUM, DECEMBER, 1916)\r\n\r\n_False angina_, from irritating solution.\r\n\r\n_Gastric disorder._ Oil and tobacco (with tachycardia or jaundice) (use\r\nipecac).\r\n\r\n_Diarrhea._ (Isolate.)\r\n\r\nDiarrheal stools imitated by a mixture of urine and water.\r\n\r\nDysenteric stools imitated by the addition of fat pork and bits of raw\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\n_Appendicitis._ Complaint of pain at the well-known McBurney point.\r\n\r\n_Tape worm._ Carriers supply others.\r\n\r\n_Jaundice._ (Smoke mixture of antipyrin and tobacco; drink tobacco\r\njuice.

He came under observation May 14, 1915, with a huge edema\r\nof forearm and hand, suddenly stopping at the elbow, an elastic edema,\r\nespecially marked in the palm, which was restored to its smooth contour\r\nvery quickly after being compressed by the fingers, and very like an\r\nelephantiasis. The hand was in a position of moderate extension on the\r\nforearm, with fist clenched. There was a linear ecchymotic line at the\r\nupper edge of the zone of edema, especially on the antero-internal face.\r\n\r\nAccording to the soldier’s own story, the swelling had begun a\r\nfortnight after the injury. He said that a very tight moist dressing\r\nhad been applied during the first few days.\r\n\r\nThe patient was cared for by massage, and then by local baths. He was\r\nanesthetized in December and several drains were inserted; no result.\r\nIn January he was chloroformed again and two long incisions were made\r\nalong the internal border of the supinator longus and along the ulnar\r\nborder of the forearm. He was better for two weeks after this second\r\noperation, but then grew worse.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of syringomyelia was now made, based upon the appearance\r\nof the arm and upon some ill-defined hypesthesia. This diagnosis was\r\nnot entertained by Léri and Roger who, when they obtained the patient,\r\nput him into a plaster cast up to the shoulder. The edema went down\r\nrapidly to normal. In short, it was here a question of a simulator, who\r\nwas even willing to undergo surgical operations with general anesthesia.\r\n\r\n_Re_ evading service, Gleboff’s classification is as follows: 1. False\r\nassertion of disease of (_a_) internal organs, (_b_) vision, (_c_)\r\nhearing, (_d_) joints. 2. Simulation of temporary disease of organs. 3.\r\nMutilation of limbs.\r\n\r\n_Re_ swelling of hand and forearm, see remarks on hysterical edema\r\nunder Cases 407 and 456.\r\n\r\n\r\nA German shell-shy.\r\n\r\n=Case 469.= (GAUPP, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nGaupp’s simulator had not been under shell fire. He said to his captain\r\nthat he wanted to see his badly wounded brother (he had in fact no\r\nbrother), and got a furlough on this ground. He then fled as far as\r\npossible from the front, into the interior, roved about for some days,\r\nfalsely asserting that he was under dentist’s treatment.\r\n\r\nHe was brought to Tübingen on the ground of mental derangement,\r\non a hospital train, and was delivered to the clinic as a case of\r\nShell-shock. This man’s state of excitement soon ended. As Gaupp could\r\nnot make out his case clinically, he applied to the regiment and\r\nreceived in return court-martial papers. The man confessed that he\r\nhad made false statements and fled because he was afraid of shells.\r\nReproached with simulation, he preserved a shameful silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fair exchange no robbery: France gets a simulator in an exchange with\r\nGermany of prisoners “unfit for service.”\r\n\r\n=Case 470.= (MARIE, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA French soldier arrived in France from Germany in a reciprocal\r\nexchange of prisoners supposed to be incapable of bearing arms. The\r\nman showed a paraplegia with clonic movements of exaggerated degree.\r\nHe was rapidly “cured” after being placed in a military hospital, and\r\ndisciplined. He proved to be a vulgar simulator.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the German physicians had made a gross error in\r\ndiagnosis; but what, asks Marie, should be done with such a man, since\r\nhe evidently should not be given a convalescent leave or a retirement?\r\nShould he be sent back to his dépôt?\r\n\r\nIf a year’s treatment yields no results, Grasset suggests discharge\r\nwith suitable gratuity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMULATION: Question of Quincke’s disease.\r\n\r\n=Case 471.= (LEWITUS, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman was brought to the eye department of the Wieden Hospital\r\nearly in May, 1915, with a diagnosis (from the internists) of Quincke’s\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nUnder the conjunctiva of each globus oculi were countless small air\r\nvesicles. There was not the slightest emphysema of the eyelids or of\r\nthe skin about the eyes. The skin in the neighborhood of the zygoma\r\nwas thick, red and swollen; but no air could be demonstrated in the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues on palpation. Next day the skin swelling and\r\nthe conjunctival emphysema had disappeared. No communication of the\r\norbits with the air spaces of the skull could be demonstrated nor was\r\nit possible to push air into the conjunctiva by nose-blowing. The\r\nfundi were both normal and vision was normal. Special rhinological\r\nexamination showed the nose to be normal. It was the skin swelling of\r\nthe orbital region that had given rise to the diagnosis of Quincke’s\r\ndisease. The man had been then referred to the internists who could,\r\nhowever, find no evidence of disease whatever.\r\n\r\nDuring the three months’ stay of the patient in the eye department,\r\nonce more swelling of the left orbital region and air under the\r\nconjunctiva of the left globus oculi suddenly appeared one day, but\r\ndisappeared over night. At this time small subconjunctival ecchymoses\r\nwere found.\r\n\r\nThis case must be regarded as one of simulation but produced in a\r\nmanner unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nBruises of head and back, not severe: “A case of pensionitis, a\r\nself-made neurasthenic for medicolegal purposes.”\r\n\r\n=Case 472.= (COLLIE, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nSir John Collie remarks that sometimes one has to recommend a pension\r\nknowing that what amounts to a fraud is being perpetrated. A seaman,\r\n25, got newspaper notoriety after receiving some not very serious\r\nbruises of head and back. Two months later, when seen by Sir John\r\nCollie, he was a victim of bent back. He was finally able to remove\r\nhis clothes and put them on with some alacrity, although at first he\r\ndeclared he could not. Woebegone during examination, he was noted to\r\nlaugh and gossip with strangers outside. A physician had diagnosticated\r\nit as an obscure spinal lesion, but as he was fit to work, he was sent\r\nback.\r\n\r\nForty-one days later he put himself on the sick-list again. Pluck and\r\nnerve were gone beyond recall, according to his physician. In hospital\r\nhis appetite was good, he slept well, and he had no troubles except an\r\nhysterical loss of sensation. There followed 33 days in hospital, three\r\nweeks in a convalescent home, and return to work for a month. Unable to\r\nstoop or kneel for pain, he was thought organic.\r\n\r\nSir John found him without desire to get well, hysterical, and\r\nsuffering “from pensionitis, a self-made neurasthenic for medico-legal\r\npurposes.” He was placed for four months in a nerve hospital. On\r\nleaving this hospital he was still in the bent-back position, and went\r\ninto a pantomime display when asked to touch his toes. Four weeks in\r\nthe convalescent home found the following: The attending physician\r\nnow suggested locomotor ataxia as the correct diagnosis! Sir John\r\nCollie was asked to report finally as to the fitness for work. Well\r\nassured that the patient was really a malingerer, Sir John nevertheless\r\ncertified him as permanently unfit for further service as a case of\r\ntraumatic neurasthenia, venturing to predict that after receiving the\r\npension, he would be at work within six months. He received the pension\r\n(25 s. a week for life), and Sir John Collie’s ability at prediction\r\nwas justified by his return to work, at the end of exactly six months.\r\n\r\n_Re_ malingerers, Glueck remarks that a malingerer, besides being a\r\nmalingerer, is a worthless sort of person in any event, and calls\r\nattention to the fact that special stresses may reduce men to lower\r\ncultural levels, to which lying and deceit may be more appropriate.\r\nGlueck remarks that the lay mind does not readily appreciate that\r\na man with mental disease may at the same time be a malingerer of\r\nadditional mental symptoms. It may be added that the professional mind\r\nis sometimes equally slow to appreciate the fact.\r\n\r\n                               CHART 14\r\n\r\n                              SHELL-SHOCK\r\n\r\n      GROUP I.

TREATMENT AND RESULTS OF SHELL-SHOCK.\r\n\r\n    “E però leva su, vinci l’ambascia\r\n      con l’animo che vince ogni battaglia\r\n      se col suo grave corpo non s’accascia.\r\n\r\n    “Più lunga scala convien che si saglia:\r\n      non basta da costoro esser partito\r\n      se tu m’intendi, or fa sì che ti vaglia.”\r\n\r\n    “And therefore rise! conquer thy panting\r\n      with the soul, that conquers every battle,\r\n      if with its heavy body it sinks not down.\r\n\r\n    “A longer ladder must be climbed:\r\n      to have quitted these is not enough;\r\n      if thou understandest me, now act so that it may profit thee.”\r\n\r\n                                         Inferno, Canto XXIV, 52-57.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn previous sections we have already become acquainted with many\r\ntherapeutic successes and failures: indeed it was almost necessary to\r\ndetail treatment in certain cases to show the nature of the disease in\r\nhand or the correctness of a given diagnosis. In the present Section we\r\napproach the question more systematically.\r\n\r\nAfter presenting a few examples of various spontaneous and non-medical\r\nrecoveries, we bring into contrast the types of medical recovery that\r\nmay be termed rapid (or miracle) cures and those that fall under the\r\ngeneral head of reëducation. Admixed are cases of failure as well as of\r\nsuccess: if it be remarked that the case method puts forward the best\r\nfoot, it is probable that the same is true of almost any therapeutics\r\nas reported in early articles. As we go to press, trench reports\r\nindicate that at least one part of the profession is far more hopeful\r\nof successful psychotherapy even in the physiopathic group of disorders\r\nthan their expounder, Babinski, could concede. The true statistical\r\nevaluation of the results must come years later.\r\n\r\nSome neuropsychiatrists have been fond of saying that there is nothing\r\nnew in Shell-shock, that specialists have long been familiar with the\r\npsychoneuroses, etc. Yet in the past, specialists have not learned\r\novermuch about the true inwardness of the psychoneuroses. Even a casual\r\ninspection of the various therapeutic efforts here described shows how\r\nmuch novelty of observation and ingenuity of plan must eternally be\r\nshown in these ever-so-simple psychoneuroses!\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Deafmutism. Spontaneous cure.\r\n\r\n=Case 473.= (MOTT, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA British soldier, 25, a coal miner, had had a bicycle accident five\r\nyears before, after which he was unconscious for 2½ hours, and gave up\r\nwork for five weeks, with headaches, fainting-fits, and nervousness\r\never after and with a tendency to imagine he could see things when\r\nthere was nothing to be seen.\r\n\r\nSeptember 19, 1915, he was under shell fire in trench and dugout. A\r\nsergeant and three men working with him were killed by an explosion,\r\nand he remembers his cap being lifted off his head. He came to in 46\r\nRest Camp, some time later, unable to see clearly, or to hear or speak,\r\nand with headache and insomnia. He brought a paper from a hospital in\r\nFrance, saying, “Doctor, I had an awful dream last night again; I was\r\ndreaming that I was in the trenches; I could see the men falling and\r\nthe great big shells exploding. I could see the light from the bursting\r\nof the shells very plain. They fairly lighted all the place up. I woke\r\nup very anxious I can tell you. I wish I could give over dreaming, and\r\nI keep having pains in my head right across my eyes.”\r\n\r\nOctober 15, while sitting by himself outdoors, he felt a slight\r\ncrackling in his head, noticed that he could hear sounds faintly, and\r\nin a few minutes he could hear fairly well.\r\n\r\nOctober 17, he was heard making inarticulate noises in his sleep. The\r\ncorporal next him told him about the noises in his half drowsy state;\r\nhe tried to speak and said, “Mother.” He then felt queer all over, with\r\npain in his head, and afterward became able to talk very well with\r\nslight hesitation.\r\n\r\n_Re_ spontaneous cures, Elliot Smith and Pear cite the cure of two\r\nmutes on hearing that Roumania had entered the war, and the cure of\r\nanother by seeing Charlie Chaplin’s antics. Some workers (for example,\r\nAimé), treat the functional mutes by simply leaving them to themselves,\r\nand maintain that they secure numerous spontaneous recoveries,\r\nregarding these as superior to cures by isolation, psychotherapeutic\r\ntreatment, and the like.\r\n\r\n                               CHART 16\r\n\r\n                       METHODS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY\r\n\r\n    HYPNOSIS\r\n      VERBAL SUGGESTION\r\n      FIXATION\r\n      FASCINATION\r\n      VARIOUS\r\n\r\n    SUGGESTION (WAKING)\r\n      VERBAL\r\n      DRUG\r\n      APPARATUS\r\n\r\n    AUTOSUGGESTION\r\n\r\n    DISTRACTION\r\n\r\n    TERRORISM\r\n\r\n    INFLICTION OF PAIN\r\n\r\n    PERSUASION\r\n\r\n    WILL TRAINING\r\n\r\n    OCCUPATION THERAPY\r\n\r\n    ISOLATION\r\n\r\n    PSYCHOANALYSIS\r\n\r\n_Re_ mutism spontaneously or non-medically cured, see also cases 476,\r\n480, 481, 482. For various medical methods of treatment, see, _e.g._,\r\ncases 516, 518, 520, 526, 544, 579.\r\n\r\nMott had a case which had been mute more than six months, unable to\r\nwhistle, phonate in coughing, or blow out a candle, though heard to\r\nshout in his sleep: This patient recovered his speech when pitched out\r\nof a punt on New Year’s Eve. The condition was in one sense physical\r\nenough, as the X-ray showed that the man’s diaphragm hardly moved\r\neven with the greatest effort. Mott regarded the inhibition of the\r\nbreathing movements, especially the phonation, as caused by fear. Mott\r\nspeaks of a case that recovered on being told by a comrade that he had\r\ntalked in his sleep. The man was so astonished by this statement that\r\nhe said, “I don’t believe it.” Other instances of cure under quasi\r\nnatural conditions are related by Mott: In the presence of a functional\r\nmute, Mott speaks loudly to the patient’s sister so that the patient\r\nmay hear: “This man must be kept on a No. 1 diet, and when he can\r\nask loud enough for you to hear, he can have a bottle of stout and a\r\nmutton-chop.” Several mutes are reported to have gotten well the next\r\nday under this treatment.\r\n\r\nThese effects shade imperceptibly over into the manifestly suggestive,\r\nand probably no sharp line can be drawn between the effects of medical\r\nsuggestion, non-medical heterosuggestion, and even autosuggestion.\r\nAdrian and Yealland rather decry the Micawber line of waiting for\r\nsomething to turn up. Zeehandelaar, a Dutch professor, studied Berlin\r\nmethods (Lewandowsky), and found numerous cases (both of mutism and of\r\ndeafness, paralyses, contractures, and tremors) lying about without\r\nspecial treatment. According to this observer, the expectant treatment\r\nwas sometimes successful, and sometimes not; if unsuccessful, the\r\nsoldier was sent home, and re-examined a year later; whereupon he might\r\nbe found to have profited by this long waiting and to have gotten well\r\nenough to return to army duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nA decorated officer, evacuated for Shell-shock on the third day of the\r\nAisne, after four days returns to the front. Evacuated a second time,\r\nafter weeks returns to the front without relapse.\r\n\r\n=Case 474.= (GILLES, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA young officer, with many decorations for brilliant Colonial service,\r\nwas in the battle of the Marne, under six consecutive days’ shell fire,\r\nsmoked phlegmatically a cigarette no matter whether walls were crashing\r\nor horses disemboweled beside him, and was uniformly able to stimulate\r\nhis men to the heavy work by humor or heroic phrases.\r\n\r\nA week later, on the third day of the Aisne, he had to be evacuated.\r\nHe was another man--wild-eyed, shivering, jumping at the least noise,\r\nunable to eat or sleep, given to battle dreams. He had to be carried\r\naway from the battle zone and put in a bed in a town in the rear and\r\ngiven chloral. The nightmares continued. On being awakened he would\r\nask where he was. He was kept in bed, given strychnine cacodylate,\r\nand dieted. He went back to the front in four days. Two days later he\r\nhad to be evacuated a second time. After some weeks more in the rear,\r\nhowever, he went back to the front, and thereafter had not relapsed\r\n(April, 1916.)\r\n\r\n_Re_ relapses, Wiltshire thinks their causes and frequency prove the\r\npsychogenic nature of Shell-shock. Ballard states that a severe case\r\nlasting six months does not recover in the army. Many that are said to\r\nrecover in hospital break down at dépôts, often with symptoms quite\r\nunlike those which they originally presented, and it will be remembered\r\nthat Ballard has an epileptic theory of the nature of Shell-shock.\r\nSee Cases 82, 83, and 84 in Section A, III, Epileptoses. But another\r\nportion of Ballard’s contentions relates to a causation through fear\r\nsuppressions released by perturbing events. According to Ballard, if\r\nthe man endeavors to re-suppress the released fear, the fits occur.\r\nBallet and DeFursac note the frequency of relapses--fewer after\r\ntreatment at the front.\r\n\r\n\r\nVicissitudes in fifteen months of a Shell-shock case with mutism and\r\namnesia. Attacks of mania. Hyperthyroidism?\r\n\r\n=Case 475.= (PURSER, October, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn Englishman, 21, in a rifle regiment, arrived in May, 1915, at\r\nthe Dublin University V. A. D. Hospital, being dumb, impaired as to\r\nvision and hearing, having dilated pupils, tremors, restlessness and\r\nweakness, and giving the impression of visual hallucinations. Although\r\nsuspicious, he was treated kindly for a few days, recovered his\r\nhearing, and wrote the few things that he remembered about home and the\r\nwar, now and then tremulously and perspiringly writing down, “Asylum;\r\ndo not lock up; I am not mad.”\r\n\r\nWith the idea of hypnosis, his bed was surrounded by screens, whereupon\r\nhe grew so perturbed that the attempted hypnosis could not be executed.\r\nHe learned the letters PP, TT, SSS, A-OOO, and finally AA-SS, AA-TT,\r\nT-OO, and after many weeks SS-SST-R and B-TT-R. His father visited him\r\nand probably was recognized.\r\n\r\nAt the end of September another dumb Shell-shock case recovered speech\r\nupon being given ether. Maj. Purser asked the sister to arrange for a\r\nlike treatment for the first case, explaining that an examination of\r\nhis throat might be painful. The cure of the second case by anesthesia\r\ngot into the papers and before he was treated the account was possibly\r\nseen by the hitherto gentle rifleman. At any rate, he was seized with\r\na sort of spasm, became furious and could only see Germans coming and\r\ncarrying off his machine gun. He shouted for help. A half grain of\r\nmorphine was given him and when it began to take effect the fighting\r\nspirit gave way to despair. He trembled over the loss of the gun, and\r\nremained in this state of despair for three days, remembering his\r\nregiment number and the like, but amnestic for his life during the past\r\nfew months. He could not read now because print was indistinct. Words,\r\nwhen he had spelled them out, conveyed no meaning. He had a functional\r\nalexia. When he saw a picture of a bunch of flowers in a notebook\r\nof his, he had another spell of excitement and regained his power of\r\nspeech, remembering about his experiences only that he had been locked\r\nup. He had now completely forgotten his father, who came to call.\r\n\r\nBy the end of October he was stronger, but his horizon was still\r\nlimited to the hospital surroundings and a little newspaper reading.\r\nHeadaches and impaired vision persisted. Sight temporarily left him\r\nearly in November, and there was a suggestion of an epileptic fit\r\none day early in that month. Tonic and sedative drugs and suggestive\r\nremedies were of no avail. Hypnotism made him worse, and psychanalysis\r\nwas, perforce, ineffective through the amnesia. At the end of November\r\ndepression and suicidal thoughts set in, with an elevation of blood\r\npressure to 178 m.m., pulse 80 to 90. Maj. Dawson then thought he was a\r\nsuicidal melancholic. Rest in bed and thyroid extract were given, but\r\nthe latter threw up his pulse on the fifth day to 140. He grew better\r\nmentally on the treatment, however, and his blood pressure fell to 140\r\nin three weeks. He was now over-emotional, unable to stand or walk or\r\nfeed himself or to pull on his socks.\r\n\r\nFor change of scene he was transferred to Mercer’s Hospital in\r\nFebruary, 1916. He suffered from astasia-abasia. The tremor became\r\njerky, coarse and persistent. The thyroid gland grew a good deal in\r\nsize during the spring and the pulse went up to 120 per minute. There\r\nwas also well-marked dermographia and there was a suggestion of the\r\nclinical picture of Graves’ disease. Even a quarter grain of morphine\r\nhad little or no effect upon an ineradicable insomnia.\r\n\r\nMaj. Purser gave the case up as a bad job and the man was discharged\r\nand sent home September 2, 1916. During the next two months at home he\r\nimproved in steadiness, though he flushed if dealing with strangers,\r\nand improved as to memory. He began to be able to read better. He had\r\nbegun to be able to get about on his feet without so much support. The\r\nultimate outcome could not be reported by Maj. Purser.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Mutism. Cure after killing a snake.\r\n\r\n=Case 476.= (JONES, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn Australian soldier of 20 went to Egypt, thence to Gallipoli where,\r\non July 29, 1915, he was almost completely buried by earth from the\r\nbursting of a high explosive shell. He was admitted to hospital August\r\n5 and transferred to Malta, where he did not speak, stared into space\r\nand sometimes made, impulsively, attempts to get away. About September\r\n17 he began to assist the orderlies and played draughts.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis there was cerebral concussion. He was sent back to\r\nAustralia by transport and had to be put in a padded cell on November\r\n1, having become violent, noisy and destructive. He would assault\r\nanyone who beat him at the game of draughts and threw anything he\r\ncould lay his hands on out of the porthole. Hyoscine he resented\r\nand threatened the givers by signs. He was at times restrained. He\r\nthreatened to throw himself overboard. Diagnosis: Melancholia.\r\n\r\nAt Melbourne he was found in good physical shape, but dazed, mute,\r\napparently deaf, indicating his wants by signs. With pencil and paper\r\nhe would draw a ship or a gun and would copy any question put to him in\r\nwriting. He played draughts intelligently and made friends with one of\r\nhis shipmates. In four days’ time he began to communicate in writing,\r\nanswering simple questions correctly. Asked to put a question, he wrote\r\n“Do you think I am mad?” On the appropriate answer he shook hands with\r\nthe physician heartily.\r\n\r\nHe was then sent to a military convalescent home at Highton. Here\r\nhe communicated often in writing, and had an appreciation of sounds\r\nwithout distinguishing words. At a picnic on December 4 he killed a\r\nsnake. While returning in the dark he began to whistle a song the\r\nrest of the party were singing. At the end of the song he clapped his\r\nhands and said, “What is the next item on the program?” Thereafter he\r\nwas able to hear and speak. Seen four days later he asked to join the\r\nofficers’ training school. However, he was discharged as permanently\r\nunfit for the service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse in hospital of an oniric delirium.\r\n\r\n=Case 477.= (BUSCAINO and COPPOLA, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian gun-maker, 27 (father neurotic; grandmother and mother,\r\nalcoholic; patient excessive onanist), was called to arms June 14,\r\n1915, and went into artillery service in the Tolmino, early in\r\nSeptember. Some time later, a shell burst about 30 meters away and\r\nkilled his lieutenant. The patient, however, was not hurt and did not\r\neven fall. He became mute and inaccessible, and was sent to a military\r\nhospital, and thence to an asylum in Udine, where he was restless and\r\nhallucinatory. October 2, he was sent to Florence on two months’ leave\r\nfor convalescence. He was still hallucinated, always seeing his dead\r\nlieutenant. He spoke rarely, slept little, and his conduct became more\r\nand more queer. Now and again, he would act exactly as if he were at\r\nthe front. November 5, he started off to find his brother, but was\r\nmet by a hospital attendant, who promptly took him to a clinic. Here\r\nhe was inaccessible and lived in a hallucinatory way a soldier’s life\r\nat the front: in continual movement, shielding his eyes with his\r\nhands as if looking far into the distance, bending down to turn an\r\nimaginary lever, apparently taking part of his aim, crouching in a\r\ncorner, clapping his ears with his palms, and obeying hallucinatory\r\ncommands: “Ready,” “Fire,” and the like. As to his interpretation\r\nof the actual surroundings, he would give a military salute at the\r\nentrance of the physician, as if he were the lieutenant. Another\r\npatient near by was interpreted as a spy. Hypodermic injections,\r\nNovember 6, were interpreted as military antityphoid injections. On\r\nsucceeding days he piled dry horse-chestnut leaves for a parapet, which\r\nbecame the scene of battle. November 12 he had become a little more\r\nlucid. November 14, he evidently heard whistling and made the leaves\r\nready as a bed for horses. November 15, he rolled up his blanket in a\r\nmilitary fashion and hid in a cell corner. He explained, November 16,\r\nthat he was a sentinel and had not been relieved by the corporal. He\r\nhad saved everybody’s lives by signaling from a tree the presence of\r\nfour airplanes. He could not be convinced he was in an institution for\r\nthe insane. November 20, he was virtually recovered but amnestic for\r\nwhat he had done since commitment. Headaches and dizziness. November\r\n21, he remembered some of his dreams, especially one of being blinded\r\nand another of being tied by a German to a tree. By November 29 he had\r\nbecome lucid and oriented, but there was an amnestic gap for his stay\r\nat the clinic. Early in December the fields of vision were contracted;\r\npolyopia and a glaring and burning sensation before the eyes (after\r\neach test conjunctival and tear duct inflammation).\r\n\r\nDecember 21, discharged well.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the nature of oniric delirium, see discussion under Cases 333\r\nand 450, Chavigny had but two cases out of 260 in which a _rapid_\r\ncurability was noted (90 per cent finally curable). Chavigny’s\r\ntreatment consists of rest in bed, quiet, purgation if necessary, and\r\nwarm or cold shower baths. Chavigny remarks upon the extraordinary\r\ntransformation from apathy to lucidity in the course of a few minutes,\r\nbrought about by arranging a slight but definite emotional shock to the\r\npatient, namely, by mentioning in his presence something about home or\r\nfamily. One bit of technic was to get the patient to write or dictate a\r\nletter home.\r\n\r\nRégis remarks that battle dreams of this nature occasionally affect\r\nalcoholics in garrison or at home. The victim ought not to be\r\nhastily committed to an asylum, but should be treated in a military\r\nneuropsychiatric service with isolation chambers and open wards.\r\nRégis organized early in the war at Bordeaux a central psychiatric\r\nservice along these modern lines. He remarks that the central service\r\nought to receive not only patients from the military hospitals, but\r\nalso patients from the temporary auxiliary hospitals of the city and\r\ndistrict round about. A pooling of the military and civilian issue upon\r\nrational lines is here indicated.\r\n\r\nRégis and others have remarked upon the necessity of differentiating\r\nthese battle deliria from toxic and infectious psychoses.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion: Deafmutism, recovery of speech with electrical\r\ntreatment; deafness cured by suggestion in writing.\r\n\r\n=Case 478.= (BUSCAINO and COPPOLA, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA fusileer, 20 (mother neurotic, brother hemiparetic from infantile\r\ndisease; patient had extreme otorrhea from an early otitis media),\r\nentered the army January 15, 1915. He was sent to the Isonzo in\r\nMay and was slightly injured in the nape of the neck and the left\r\ncalf by fragments of a shell that exploded near by. He was picked\r\nup unconscious and taken to the hospital at Servignano. There he\r\nwas given electric treatment, and in a period of 18 days recovered\r\nhis speech, passing through a phase of stammering. He was sent to a\r\nspecial hospital in Florence, still deaf, and passed into a state of\r\nmental excitement with visual hallucinations of soldiers. He was given\r\nchloral and bromide. He insisted that he was incurably deaf. August\r\n22, he was admitted to Buscaino’s clinic, completely deaf, slightly\r\nstuporous, somewhat indifferent, and innocent of any effort to make\r\nhimself understood (contrary to the habits of an organically deaf\r\nperson). Simulation could be excluded. It was possible to awaken the\r\npatient during sleep by auditory stimuli, whereupon he opened his eyes\r\nbut could not hear. He talked well and spontaneously, telling about\r\nhis accident, reading and answering by signs. He was assured,--always\r\nin writing,--that upon the following Sunday his hearing would be\r\nrestored. Upon that day, during the visit of a lady,--one of the\r\npatient’s friends,--hearing was suddenly and almost completely restored\r\nin the left ear. The patient was so moved by this that he cried when\r\nthe physician came. Upon the following day, he gradually began to\r\nhear with his right ear. A slight diminution of hearing in the right\r\near persisted, however, until September 24, and was associated with\r\nheadache and pains in the left ear--pains which the patient compared to\r\nhis ear pains in childhood (remains of otitis with retraction of the\r\ntympanic membrane).\r\n\r\n\r\nParaplegia: Cured by administration of Iron Cross.\r\n\r\n=Case 479.= (NONNE, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAfter heavy shelling a soldier fell for two days into a clouded state\r\nfrom which he waked with complete paraplegia of the lower extremities,\r\nand total anesthesia from the pelvis downward (reflexes and electric\r\nexcitability normal).\r\n\r\nOn the third day after his reception in Nonne’s wards, he was _about\r\nto be_ hypnotized when news came that he had been promoted to a\r\nlieutenantcy and had received the Iron Cross. He fell forthwith into\r\nhysterical convulsions, in the midst of which the hitherto paralyzed\r\nlegs worked perfectly well! Even after the hysterical attack was over,\r\nthe man could still move his legs in bed normally, but had absolute\r\nastasia-abasia. Next day, with deep hypnosis, markedly improved. After\r\neight more days of hypnosis the new lieutenant got back his normal gait.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock, burial: Mutism. Cure by getting drunk.\r\n\r\n=Case 480.= (PROCTOR, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA patient, 25, nine years in the service, was buried in a dugout by\r\nan explosive shell at Ypres, June 17, was taken out unconscious, and\r\neventually reached the hospital at Versailles. Consciousness had\r\nreturned a few days after the injury. There was ringing in the ears,\r\ndifficulty in hearing, and inability to speak. He arrived at the\r\nDuchess of Connaught’s Hospital at Taplow, July 12, when, aside from\r\nthe above-mentioned symptoms and a rapid heart action (108 at rest), he\r\nseemed perfectly well. About August 14, he began occasionally to refuse\r\nsolid nourishment and remained in bed, eyelids closed but twitching at\r\ntimes, especially when spoken to. He resisted having his eyelids opened.\r\n\r\nAugust 27, he was allowed to go to the village with companions, and\r\ngot drunk, found his voice, for two days talked and sang incessantly.\r\nDischarged September 9, cured.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock and burial: Mutism. Cure by work in a vineyard with wine to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n=Case 481.= (ANON, May, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _British Medical Journal_ reports a case of cure\r\nof emotional mutism. This robust young soldier at Verdun was buried by\r\nthe explosion of a shell and was thereafter found unable to speak. A\r\nweek later he arrived at the ambulance in the interior, and was still\r\nmute. He could understand what was said to him without difficulty,\r\nand was able to reply by signs. He did not even move the lips when\r\nrequested to pronounce such words as _mamma_ and _papa_, but was\r\neventually induced to whisper these words.\r\n\r\nThe laryngoscope showed complete paralysis of the vocal cords, which\r\nwere in extreme abduction (it was possible to see several tracheal\r\nrings). There was no reaction on the part of the pharyngeal mucosa upon\r\nstimulation.\r\n\r\nA fortnight passed without restoration of speech, though at one\r\ntime, not having bolted the closet door, the patient was startled\r\nwhen a nurse rushed in, and he said, “Oh, pardon, Madam.” The mutism\r\npersisted. He was then given work in the vineyard, plenty of wine to\r\ndrink, and hard work. After a time (not specified) speech suddenly\r\nreturned. According to this correspondent, “this indeed is a universal\r\nexperience, namely, that hard manual work is the best remedy for such\r\nfunctional incapacities of traumatic origin.”\r\n\r\n_Re_ Cases 480 and 481, compare cures by anesthesia with chloroform,\r\nnitrous oxide, and the like.\r\n\r\n_Re_ gradual cures as opposed to sudden ones, Dundas Grant deprecates\r\nviolent measures in the treatment of mutism during the period of\r\nexhaustion after Shell-shock. However, Dundas Grant does not advocate\r\nan expectant treatment, but employs a gradual reëducation of the voice\r\nthrough imitation of the teacher. The voice is sometimes restored at a\r\nsitting, sometimes gradually; see, for example, Case 578 of Briand and\r\nPhilippe, and Case 586 of MacCurdy.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock, unconsciousness: Deafmutism: Spontaneous recovery of\r\nspeech and gradual recovery (several months’ isolation) of hearing.\r\n\r\n=Case 482.= (ZANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA musketeer was deafened and stunned by a near-by shell explosion. On\r\ncoming to, he found no wound, but was deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\nSpeech returned after ten days, and hearing partially, but there was\r\na tonic stuttering. He had to hunt anxiously for words, talked like\r\na child in infinitives and telegram style, although he could express\r\nhimself in writing perfectly well.\r\n\r\nHearing improved on the right side very quickly, but on the left side\r\nconditions varied from total deafness to subtotal deafness. There was\r\na general hyperesthesia of the skin, pain on pressure on the temples,\r\nexaggeration of skin and tendon reflexes, marked tremor in both hands.\r\nThe man was anxious, depressed, and irritable. During caloric tests\r\nof the vestibular apparatus in the course of the next few weeks, the\r\nman had an hysterical attack of crying twice, following which all the\r\nphenomena got worse.\r\n\r\nRest and isolation from all such influences procured an almost complete\r\nrecovery in several months.\r\n\r\n_Re_ differential recoveries, see also Case 585 of Liébault, in which\r\nspeech was recovered by suggestion and reëducation, and hearing by a\r\nprocess of reëducation alone.\r\n\r\n_Re_ isolation, Roussy and Lhermitte remark that in all the\r\npsychoneuroses of war, isolation is a valuable and indeed an\r\nindispensable aid to psychotherapy. The application of this old\r\nclassical method of Weir Mitchell reinforces the persuasive talk of\r\nthe doctor on the day of admission, allows the man to think over\r\nthe promises made to the doctor, and permits longer observation. It\r\ndepends on the case, whether rigorous isolation on limited diet shall\r\nbe employed. See below a general discussion of the psycho-electric and\r\nreëducative method employed in French centres.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarches; battles; slight shell wound of left upper arm: Hysterical\r\nanesthesia of the arm and tremors (NO paresis). Causes slight--disease\r\nobstinate (partly explained by furloughs among sympathetic friends).\r\n\r\n=Case 483.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 26, without heredity, always well, in long marches and\r\nseveral battles early in the war, August 23 sustained slight shell\r\nwounds of thighs and left upper arm. He was unconscious about five\r\nminutes. In eight days, the wounds were healed, and all movements were\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the trauma the arms trembled, and at times the legs.\r\nTreatment was instituted (baths, drugs, massage, electricity), but\r\nwithout result. After a month’s treatment and a furlough at home, the\r\npatient was sent, January 3, 1915, to the Jena Nerve Hospital. He was\r\na powerful man of middle size, with some small movable scars on the\r\nleft upper arm, remains of the shell injury; two similar scars of the\r\ngluteus maximus. The deep reflexes were slightly exaggerated, as were\r\nthe skin reflexes. The touch and pain sense in the left arm was absent\r\nas far as the shoulder in typical segmental fashion. Arm movements were\r\nfree; there was an occasional tremor in both arms, especially the left.\r\nThis tremor would pronouncedly increase upon intentional movements and\r\nwith emotion.\r\n\r\nHe said that about two weeks before, at home, he had waked up in the\r\nnight and lain down on the floor beside his bed, feeling giddy in his\r\nhead. In a week the tremors had diminished, leaving only a very slight\r\ntremor of the left hand. The patient went to considerable pains to\r\nconceal his tremor, holding his hand in a military position at the seam\r\nof the trousers, on the medical visit. Sometimes he would succeed in\r\nmaking the tremor quite disappear. February 5, he was busy about the\r\nward work, going errands and carrying trays. He would intentionally\r\nspare his left hand in this work. Upon trying gymnastic exercises, the\r\ntremors of the left hand and also of the right reappeared. After a few\r\ndays these tremors again disappeared, only to come back on the 12th,\r\nwhen there was a constant tremor also when the patient was at rest. He\r\nhad been affected when observing another patient (8[7]). Accordingly,\r\nhe was separated from this patient and put in a psychiatric ward. The\r\ntremor remained of varying intensity, sometimes being absent for hours\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n    [7] See Case 8 of Binswanger’s article.\r\n\r\nRequest for furlough at the beginning of March was refused with the\r\nstatement that it would be granted when cure was complete. The patient\r\nwas inaccessible to psychotherapeutic influence. He was always of a\r\nfriendly, modest demeanor, sleeping well, and performing all bodily\r\nfunctions properly. On any exertion the pulse ran to 134. The heart was\r\nnormal. There were outbreaks of perspiration.\r\n\r\nMarch 26, he renewed his request for leave, desiring his Easter\r\nfurlough. He was told he might expect it. March 31, the tremor was\r\nfound to have quite disappeared. Upon his return, April 12, there was\r\na marked tremor of the left arm, especially of the wrist joint, which\r\nagain disappeared after some days. The middle of June he was released\r\nas capable of garrison duty with the recruits.\r\n\r\nIf there was a mechanical factor in this case, it must have been the\r\nshaking-up of the body by the shell explosion. His skin lesions were\r\nslight. The main factor was doubtless the emotional shock. The tremor\r\nsupervened upon a very brief period of unconsciousness. It is hard,\r\naccording to Binswanger, to explain the localization of the cutaneous\r\nanesthesia without the development of a corresponding paresis. May it\r\nbe, inquires Binswanger, that the wound of the left upper arm at the\r\nmoment of the setting-in of unconsciousness, or perhaps at the moment\r\nof waking from unconsciousness, directed the mind forthwith upon the\r\nleft arm and in this way produced localized disorder of sensation? If\r\nso, why did the wound of the gluteal region not produce corresponding\r\ndisorders of feeling and sensation of an hysterical nature? The\r\nobstinacy of the disease stands in striking disproportion to the\r\nslightness of the causative factors at work.\r\n\r\nAccording to Binswanger, this is perhaps due to the long furlough which\r\nthe patient had. According to Binswanger’s experience, as that of many\r\nothers, home works badly for these hysterical patients; their friends\r\nsympathize with them too much.\r\n\r\n_Re_ furloughs, Ballard states that severe Shell-shock cases should\r\nget analogous treatment to that of civilian psychoneurotics, namely, a\r\ncomplete removal from the environment in which the illness began. He\r\nadvocates three months’ leave, after which the man is to be sent to a\r\nconvalescent home, and thence to a command dépôt. He states that if a\r\nrelapse then occurs, such a patient will never be a soldier. Ballard\r\nwould allow the men to walk about with their “pals (not with escorts).”\r\nCimbal remarks that German data show that home furloughs should be\r\navoided in every instance where possible. Fiessinger remarks, on the\r\nbasis of English experience, that a Shell-shock patient treated by\r\nrest, suggestion, and manual occupation may go back to the line “and\r\non a subsequent occasion prove a hero.” (See Case 474 of Gilles.) But\r\nForsyth remarks that it is probably injudicious to send any cases of\r\nShell-shock, with few exceptions, back to the firing line, because\r\ntheir fighting value has been permanently deteriorated, and because, if\r\nthe fear of return to the trenches is removed, recovery is more rapid.\r\nThe experience here is not unlike that of industrial accident board\r\ncases with rapid recovery after the decree of compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWar stress in a volunteer banker: Hysterical seizures. Treatment by\r\nhydrotherapy.\r\n\r\n=Case 484.= (HIRSCHFELD, February, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA banker, a volunteer (articular rheumatism at three years; at 18, some\r\nform of lung and tracheal inflammation; tendency to fainting spells\r\non cold days--heart disease was said to have been found), as a result\r\nof the strain and excitement of the war had hysterical attacks during\r\na fortnight before observation in hospital, consisting of sensations\r\nsuddenly developing in the region of the heart, stiffness of the whole\r\nbody, disorders of movement, without loss of consciousness.\r\n\r\nNovember 23, 1914, he was examined in bed in the dorsal position,\r\nwith the muscles of the legs, back, and neck in a state of tonic\r\ncontraction. He was unable to answer questions. The pupil reactions\r\nwere normal in the seizure. The attack ceased in two minutes, as the\r\nresult of hitting heavy blows on the chest with a moist handkerchief\r\nand the threat of a strong and painful application of the electric\r\ncurrent. The patient then got out of bed at request, walked about a\r\nlittle incoördinately for a time, but after a few minutes was able to\r\nwalk perfectly and to talk once more.\r\n\r\nExamined, November 25, he was found to be pale, fairly well nourished,\r\nwith a somewhat accelerated pulse, and a melancholy, slightly apathetic\r\nexpression. A systolic murmur at the right apex; accentuation of\r\nsecondary pulmonary sound; increased knee-jerks; trembling of the lids\r\n(Rosenbach).\r\n\r\nBy December 12, the patient was completely well. The seizures had not\r\nrecurred. The treatment was by hydrotherapy. A preliminary treatment\r\nis advocated by Hirschfeld, to insure peripheral circulation, either\r\nby light baths, hot douches, or packs. More important than this\r\npreliminary treatment is the cooling off process by means of tepid\r\ndouches or partial baths. These partial baths are given at 28°C. for\r\nthe intense effect of the cold. Sometimes this treatment can be\r\nconcluded with a dry pack. The patients are treated by Hirschfeld three\r\ntimes a week with both the warming and the cooling procedure.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hydrotherapy, Mott has found the continuous warm bath of great\r\nvalue in Shell-shock cases coming back from France. He keeps the\r\npatient in the water from a quarter to three-quarters of an hour, or\r\nlonger. A warm bath and a drink of warm milk at bedtime may permit a\r\nman to get on without hypnotics, or to get on with lesser amounts of\r\nhypnotics. The effect of these baths is doubtless largely somatic.\r\nSome writers stress the suggestive value of hydrotherapy as well\r\nas of electricity, radiant heat baths, and the like (Ballard). A\r\nneuropsychiatric center properly equipped with a hydrotherapeutic\r\nplant can do therapeutic work by means of the suggestion afforded by\r\na cold shower, which may act quasi miraculously, like electricity\r\n(Roussy and Boisseau). In fatigue and exhaustion cases, along with\r\nadrenalin and strychnin, Aimé gives mild hydrotherapy without other\r\nsedatives. Laehr’s free sanatorium at Schönow treats the arrhythmia and\r\ntachycardia cases with rest and hydrotherapy.\r\n\r\nBrasch reports rather poor results with hydrotherapy in the cardiac\r\nneuroses. Weichardt has used the continuous bath as a form of\r\npsychotherapy and permits the symptoms of psychoneurosis to subside\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: low blood pressure: Pituitrin.\r\n\r\n=Case 485.= (GREEN, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA lance corporal of the Expeditionary Force, 26, went to France feeling\r\nvery fit, February, 1916. He was blown up by a shell July 1, and\r\nfaintly remembered crawling out of some water. He came to in a dugout,\r\ndumb and partially deaf, and was blind for a few minutes. August 17, he\r\nwas admitted to Mott’s wards at Maudsley, mute but with hearing normal.\r\nThe hands were dusky, sweating, cold, and slightly tremulous. He was\r\ngiven to battle dreams and used to wake in a sweat and terror after\r\na pantomime of bomb-throwing. He had headache and was depressed. He\r\ncomplained of feeling cold and the surface temperature was subnormal.\r\nThe blood pressure was also subnormal (according to Green, nightmares\r\nare most marked in cases with low blood pressure; these are, in fact,\r\nseverer cases of Shell-shock than cases with high blood pressure; only\r\n10 of 27 cases with blood pressure above 120 showed nightmares).\r\n\r\nSeptember 25, he was able to speak in a whisper. The dreams had become\r\nless terrifying. The other symptoms had been slowly improving.\r\n\r\nNovember 25-28, all of the symptoms returned upon hearing the death of\r\nhis brother in action.\r\n\r\nThe man was now put on extract of pituitrin gr. 2, t.d.s. (better\r\nresults are claimed by Green from pituitrin extract than from\r\npituitary fluid injections, as these sometimes cause dizziness, of\r\nwhich no case treated with extract complained). As in other cases, the\r\nextract was immediately followed by an increase in blood pressure, a\r\ngeneral improvement and a diminution of headache and depression. The\r\nbomb-throwing pantomimes still persisted, but the patient was less weak\r\non waking. The treatment was continued for seven days, whereupon the\r\nsurface temperature began to rise and the patient himself felt that\r\nhe was much warmer. The pituitrin was discontinued after a month’s\r\ntreatment, yet the improvement persisted. The man was boarded out of\r\nthe army and in March, 1917, wrote that he was still feeling better.\r\n\r\n    SHELL-SHOCK, PITUITRIN, AND BLOOD PRESSURE (EDITH GREEN)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Blood pressure, surface temperature, and pulse\r\n    in a case of functional mutism.

Healing was\r\nrapid, but the hand assumed a peculiar position. The second and third\r\nphalanges of the fingers were extended, whereas the first phalanx was\r\nflexed. The four fingers were as if glued together. Both phalanges of\r\nthe thumb were flexed, the wrist was in extension, and the tendon of\r\nthe palmaris seemed contractured. The fingers could not be moved and\r\nthe wrist was very mobile. There was pain on attempts to move the hand\r\npassively, and small clonic contractions were made by the fingers.\r\nThere were no sensory disorders, but there was a maceration of the\r\ninterdigital spaces.\r\n\r\nMechanotherapy accelerated the contracture, and massage, motor\r\nreëducation, bromides, and sedative drugs, had no effect. Under\r\nkelene-anesthesia the contracture would disappear. In January,\r\n1915, the hand was put up in plaster in a position opposite to the\r\ncontracture. The intense pain of the first days was treated by opium.\r\nThe patient was sent on leave, and, at the end of two months, the\r\nplaster was removed; but the hand at once resumed its faulty position,\r\nand attempts to alter its position again provoked pain. Elastic\r\ntraction was then tried for six weeks, and the bad position was\r\nsomewhat modified but not improved by hyperextending the second phalanx\r\non the first, and putting the third in slight flexion on the second.\r\nHot compresses were unsuccessful also. May 14, 1915, the position was\r\nstill irreducible; there was no R. D. or electrical hyperexcitability.\r\nThis was not a question of radial paralysis, since finger extension was\r\ndistinct; nor a paralysis of the median, since the thumb was flexed.\r\nThe contracture, in fact, does not affect a special nerve territory,\r\nand the disorder is in the ulnar, radial, and median territories.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrthopedic case.\r\n\r\n=Case 487.= (SOLLIER, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA patient suffered from a rupture of the peroneal nerve in its lower\r\npart, September, 1915, and had operation scars before and behind the\r\nexternal malleolus. He was immobilized for 45 days at first, and then\r\nfor 30 days, with the foot in extension on account of the pain produced\r\nin the endeavor to put it into normal position. A 6 cm. atrophy was\r\nthen found to affect the calf, and there was a fibrous retraction of\r\nthe tendo Achillis and of the calf muscles. There was no anesthesia,\r\nthe toes moved easily, the foot was fixed in equinus, with about 7\r\ncm. of the heel above the ground. He was placed in various orthopedic\r\ninstitutions and was treated with mechanotherapy, but without result.\r\n\r\nAt the neurological center, however, in six weeks, he was got to\r\nwalk, with his heel on the ground, by means of massage and manual\r\nmobilization. The atrophy diminished a centimeter and the foot became\r\nmobile in all directions.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sollier, mechanotherapy by means of apparatus is apt to\r\nbe ineffective, especially in contractures, because its action ceases\r\nthe moment it ought to commence, namely, when the patient is beginning\r\nto react a little painfully after recovery from anesthesia. In cases\r\nof retraction, mechanotherapy with apparatus does not allow the proper\r\ncombination of massage with progressive mobilization.\r\n\r\n_Re_ orthopedic cases, Jones classes the conditions that create an\r\northopedic case under four heads (note especially the fourth):\r\n\r\n1. Mechanical injury to bone, joint, muscle, or nerve.\r\n\r\n2. Atrophy and disease of these structures primarily due to the injury.\r\n\r\n3. Incoördination of movement due to disease of the brain--a result of\r\natrophy and disease of peripheral structures.\r\n\r\n4. Psychological conditions which can be overcome by reëducational\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n    MECHANOTHERAPY (COLOLIAN)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ROTATION OF SHOULDER]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ROTATION OF SHOULDER]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANKLE EXTENSION]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANKLE EXTENSION]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FLEXION AND EXTENSION]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ROTATION OF HIP]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ELBOW FLEXION AND EXTENSION]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CIRCUMDUCTION OF THIGH]\r\n\r\n\r\nFavorable effects of lumbar puncture.\r\n\r\n=Case 488.= (RAVAUT, August, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn accountant, 20, in the 135th infantry sustained shock from mine\r\nexplosion near his trench, March 6. He was kept two days at the relief\r\nstation. March 8, at the ambulance, he did not appear to understand\r\nquestions and had a fixed stare. He complained of a violent headache\r\nand kept pressing his head between his hands. He kept looking about him\r\nanxiously, and the slightest noise made him jump. He would mutter a\r\nfew incomprehensible words, and in reply to a question would give only\r\nthe last phrase which he happened to have been saying. Lumbar puncture\r\nshowed a very slight excess of albumin. Next day, he answered his name.\r\nMarch 12, he could speak in monosyllables, and he began to understand\r\nwhat was said. After the lumbar puncture, the headache disappeared and\r\ndid not set in again. March 13, he began to be able to write and say\r\nshort phrases. March 16, expression was good though hesitant, and the\r\npatient wrote a letter to his parents, telling about his shock. Lumbar\r\npuncture showed that the albumin was now normal. From the rear, April\r\n5, the patient sent Ravaut a postcard in perfect form, telling how he\r\nwas ready to go back to the front.\r\n\r\n_Re_ lumbar puncture, Imboden quotes Podmanizky as having used lumbar\r\npuncture as a method of suggestion for the cure of abasia. See also\r\ncases 560 and 561, in which Claude cured two cases of dysbasia by\r\nthe device of stovaine anesthesia of the spinal cord. Pastine also\r\nhas a case in which a slight improvement was produced on removal of\r\ncerebrospinal fluid, and a sudden and complete cure was brought about\r\nby the second puncture, a very painful tap. Pastine’s case is thought\r\nby him (1916) to be in part at least organic.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet wound of forearm: Hysterical clenching of fist. Recovery by\r\nfatiguing the flexors.\r\n\r\n=Case 489.= (REEVE, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 28, was thrice wounded between August 18, 1914, and July 14,\r\n1916. The third time, a bullet passed through the fleshy part of the\r\nforearm, whereupon the hand became clenched and remained so after the\r\nwound was surgically healed. As a case of war neurosis, the man was\r\ntreated by electricity, massage, passive movements, and fixation in a\r\nstraight splint during a period of nine months, without result. He was\r\nadmitted to Maghull Military Hospital, April 18, 1917.\r\n\r\nTwo days after admission a treatment was given whose principle consists\r\nin producing a condition of fatigue in the muscles responsible for\r\ncontracture. This fatigue is produced by continuous passive movements\r\nin a direction opposed to the normal action of the muscles in question.\r\nMany hours of forcible movement are sometimes necessary in the case of\r\nthe more powerful muscles before the limp, toneless fatigue condition\r\nis brought about. Relays of men are told off for this purpose. Patients\r\nare got to assist in the work, particularly such as have been cured by\r\nthe treatment. Also, the patient is himself told about the nature of\r\nspasms and the relief which the method will bring. This patient was\r\ntold that after the flexor muscles were fatigued they would no longer\r\nbe able to pull the fingers into the clenched position, whereupon the\r\nantagonistic muscles on the back of the forearm would begin to work.\r\n\r\nThe fingers were forcibly opened without interruption for six hours,\r\nin each case as soon as the fingers closed into the palm. In a few\r\nhours they began to return more slowly, and at the end of the six hours\r\nremained extended. The extended position was still found the following\r\nmorning. The extensor muscles were feeble in action, but improved day\r\nby day. The spasm did not return. The patient was discharged July 2,\r\n1917, about two and a half months after admission to Maghull. The hand\r\nwas now strong and useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet through shoulder girdle: Hysterical adduction of arm. Treatment\r\nby induced fatigue.\r\n\r\n=Case 490.= (REEVE, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man, 29, was in hospital more than two years before the Reeve fatigue\r\ntreatment was applied to a functional contracture. This man had a\r\nbullet pass through the right scapula and out the pectoralis major,\r\nJune 4, 1915, was (according to patient’s story) operated two months\r\nlater, then further operated for drainage of septic wounds, and from\r\nAugust, 1915, had his arm fixed to the side, going into spasm at any\r\nattempt to move it passively. The elbow was extended and at first the\r\nfingers were tightly flexed and wrist extended. The finger flexion and\r\nwrist flexion cleared in March, 1917, and recurred in May. Electrical\r\nmassage in June, 1917, yielded free movement, but the spasm returned.\r\n\r\nThe man was admitted to Maghull, June 12, 1917, that is, a little over\r\ntwo years after his injury. The arm sprang back to the side like a\r\nclasp knife on being released. The wrist and fingers were moved freely.\r\nThree days after admission the elbow was forcibly flexed for some\r\nhours, whereupon the spasm disappeared. Next day the arm was forcibly\r\nabducted and reabducted: for four or five hours the arm could be\r\nvoluntarily abducted. Two assistants were necessary, such was the force\r\nof the adductor contraction. At the end of a week the patient was found\r\nable to lift his hand to the back of his head. There was no longer\r\nspasm.\r\n\r\n_Re_ abrupt treatments, amongst which Reeve’s treatment by induced\r\nfatigue may be counted, Babinski and Froment consider that abrupt\r\ntreatment is far superior to slower psychotherapy combined with\r\nisolation, whether or not we are dealing with a recent or an old\r\ndisease. So far as psychotherapy goes, Babinski wants to obtain\r\na definite improvement, if not a cure, on the first application\r\nof treatment. According to Babinski, the patient’s faith in his\r\nphysician’s power to cure him is most active at this first meeting,\r\nwhose emotionality favors the cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurial and bruises of back: Hysterical cross-legs. Treatment by induced\r\nfatigue of contractured muscles.\r\n\r\n=Case 491.= (REEVE, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man, 32, was buried by a shell and bruised about the back, August 2,\r\n1916. He was bedfast until February, 1917. Every attempt to move the\r\nlegs brought on tremors. He was then allowed up; but the attempt to\r\nwalk caused one foot to knock the other, and his ankles became bruised,\r\nnecessitating cotton wool pads for feet.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted to Maghull, June 12, with one leg crossed over the\r\nother and the thigh adductors spastic, especially on the right.\r\n\r\nThe fatigue treatment was carried out in dorsal decubitus, each leg\r\nbeing pulled by a man, and the separation repeated when necessary. Four\r\nhours a day for three days of this work finally reduced the spasm so\r\nthat the patient was able to walk with assistance. On the sixth day he\r\nwalked a mile without assistance. The spasm has not returned.\r\n\r\n_Re_ leg contractures, Bérard got successful results by continuous\r\nextension combined with injections of 1 per cent novocain into the\r\nsciatic nerve trunk and the contractured muscles. According to Babinski\r\nand Froment, there ought to be an almost certain cure of any genuine\r\nhysterical state. They quote the observations of Souques, Meige, Albert\r\nCharpentier, Clovis Vincent, Roussy, and Léri as proving this claim.\r\n\r\nThe Reeve method, so far as it is psychotherapeutic, bears a\r\nresemblance to Clovis Vincent’s first stage of what the poilu calls\r\n_torpillage_, namely, the stage of crisis and of intensive reëducation.\r\nBut Clovis Vincent uses in his direct and forcible reëducation the\r\ngalvanic current.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet wound of neck: Hysterical torticollis. Treatment by induced\r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\n=Case 492.= (REEVE, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 20, had a bullet pass through the back of the neck, July 10,\r\n1916, and returned to his dépôt surgically well October 1. A fortnight\r\nlater a Zeppelin raid turned his troop out in the middle of the night,\r\nand on the morrow the man’s neck was twisted around and inclined upon\r\nthe left shoulder.\r\n\r\nTreatment followed in various hospitals, with fixation in the corrected\r\nposition by plaster of Paris but without result. The patient was\r\nadmitted to Maghull, April 18, 1917, with spasm of left trapezius and\r\nright sternomastoid muscles. Under hypnosis the deformity could be\r\neasily corrected. Unfortunately, it returned.\r\n\r\nThe fatigue treatment described by Reeve was started a week after\r\nadmission to Maghull. The neck was forcibly straightened and\r\nrestraightened upon return to its twist. In a few hours the contracting\r\nmuscles had become fatigued; the neck was straight.\r\n\r\nThe next day the deformity returned slightly. The fatigue treatment was\r\nrepeated. The patient was discharged well, July 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurial by shell explosion: Abasia, tremors. Claw foot persistent two\r\nyears cured by induced fatigue.\r\n\r\n=Case 493.= (REEVE, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man, 24, buried by a shell, February, 1915, had had a functional\r\n“claw foot” for more than two years, cured by the Reeve fatigue\r\ntreatment in less than a week. According to Reeve, claw foot is perhaps\r\nthe most common of the war contractures, particularly intractable, and\r\noften seen out of hospital with an “inside splint.”\r\n\r\nAfter his burial this man could not walk, had tremors, was in bed for\r\nfour months and on getting up showed strongly inverted foot. Three\r\nmonths’ splint treatment, strong faradic currents, massage, passive\r\nmovements, special boots with leather wedges to tilt the foot over,\r\nwere methods of treatment tried, but unsuccessful. At Maghull from\r\nNovember 18, 1916, he was treated by exercises, passive movements,\r\nsuggestive and reëducative measures, and after a few months got about\r\nwithout sticks.\r\n\r\nThe claw foot continued. Toward the end of June, 1917, the feet were\r\nforcibly flexed and everted for eight hours. The deformity disappeared,\r\nbut returned slightly next day. Further fatigue treatment for eight\r\nhours caused the spasm to cease permanently. He was discharged quite\r\nnormal, July 20, 1917. Reeve remarks that this fatigue method might be\r\napplicable to certain hysterical contractures in civil practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkull trauma over right eye: Delirium, febrile? post-traumatic?\r\nexhaustive? Operation: Epileptiform excitement. Later, explosive\r\ndiathesis: Operation: Euphoria. Seizures and slight mental change.\r\n\r\n=Case 494.= (BINSWANGER, October, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier (brother choreic, sister infantile palsy) had had measles\r\nat 13 and in his fever climbed out of bed upon a couch, fell from\r\nthe couch and was found by his mother lying on the floor. He was of\r\nmoderate intellectual grade, of an emotional, passionate Saxon nature\r\nand had now and then been intoxicated.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1914, he was wounded over the right eye. He did not lose\r\nconsciousness but concluded that he could not get back to his own lines\r\non account of the enemy fire. Using a knapsack to cover his head, he\r\nlay down for twenty-four hours, until rescued by a passing body of the\r\nsanitary corps who were about to leave him for dead when he called\r\nloudly to them.\r\n\r\nHe was very weak in hospital and, towards the evening of the day after\r\nreceiving his injury, he must have fallen into some sort of psychotic\r\nstate lasting ten days. For this he remained quite amnestic, although\r\nhe was told by comrades that he had hallucinations and had scolded and\r\nyelled, hearing voices. Apparently there were situation-deliria--the\r\ncall to go over the top. Temperature, which had run to 38.8, after ten\r\ndays sank to normal, and consciousness cleared up.\r\n\r\nWas this a case of protracted febrile delirium? Or of psychosis due\r\nto _commotio cerebri_, that is, an effect of heightened intracranial\r\npressure? Or was it exhaustion-delirium following loss of blood, sleep\r\nand food?\r\n\r\nBut this was not the end. The wound suppurated, and in May, 1915,\r\neight months after the injury, operation was performed to relieve this\r\nabscess. Temperature immediately rose to from 38.4 to 38.6, the fever\r\nlasting three days, and a second psychotic phase with complete amnesia\r\nentered. He went into this phase immediately after recovering from\r\nthe operative narcosis, looking wildly about and cursing the sister.\r\nThe patient was violently excited and was put in a straight jacket\r\non the second day. This phase may be regarded as one of epileptiform\r\nexcitement with delirium. The operation may have played a part in the\r\npsychosis.\r\n\r\nThere were no further psychotic phenomena which could be attributed\r\nin any way to _commotio_. There were, however, attacks of cortical\r\norigin and emotional seizures. The patient became emotionally excitable\r\nand lost all inhibitions against expression of emotion, such as\r\ncrying. Once he actually tried to suppress his emotion with a noose\r\nabout his throat. He became seclusive and withdrew within himself--a\r\nvictim of Kaplan’s explosive diathesis, or of Bonhoeffer’s emotional\r\nhyperesthetic defect condition.\r\n\r\nA second operation was performed in September, 1916, to loosen the\r\nbrain scar, and a large splinter of bone was removed. During the\r\noperation, under local anesthesia, there was a severe cortical\r\nseizure with complete disappearance of the reflexes. Ether was then\r\nadministered. Later, in the same day, there were several minor cortical\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nAfter this operation the man’s emotional status changed; he was no\r\nlonger irritable or exclusive, but became slightly euphoric and\r\ncontented. He received during the next two weeks four tablets of\r\nSedobrol and for a long time thereafter two tablets daily. There were\r\nnever any phenomena of bromidism or any suggestive effects of the\r\nbromides.\r\n\r\nThe first attack after the second operation came in November, 1916, and\r\nwas followed by slight dysarthria. Repeated attacks followed which were\r\nattributed to contractions in the scar. Accordingly, a third operation\r\nwas performed and an attempt was made to bridge over a defect in the\r\nright frontal bone. The man’s emotional status remained good after the\r\noperation, but further attacks appeared six weeks later and there were\r\nspells of dizziness. Occasionally, in process of thinking, he said\r\nsomething stuck in between his thoughts. Sometimes thinking broke off\r\nsharply as if he had cut through a wire with an electrical current in\r\nit. There was a slight reduction in attention and a slightly increased\r\nfatiguability.\r\n\r\n\r\nHard service; shell explosion with loss of teeth: Vomiting. Cure by\r\nrestoration of self-confidence.\r\n\r\n=Case 495.= (MCDOWELL, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA married reservist was called up at the outbreak of the war and went\r\nthrough Mons, the Marne, and the Aisne and was finally blown up by a\r\nshell at Ypres. Early in November, 1914, he lost his speech but got\r\nit back in time to get home for Christmas. A number of teeth had been\r\nlost in the injury. Vomiting began first in England. While on leave at\r\nhome he vomited at every meal. Asked whether it was his food or his\r\nthoughts, he said, “You are quite correct, Sir, you know I have always\r\nbeen with thinking.”\r\n\r\nUnder medical care, June, 1915, he was found suffering from hesitating\r\nspeech, general tremulousness and emotionality. He worried a great deal\r\non account of money matters at home. He lay awake thinking. A child\r\nbecame ill and died, and all the while he got worse, “thinking all the\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\nIt was explained to him that the vomiting was a matter of emotions. The\r\nlost teeth were replaced by false ones. As he began to get control of\r\nhis emotions, he vomited less and increased in weight. Finally he was\r\nboarded for discharge and was sick again on the day of the meeting. A\r\nfortnight later when sent to sign discharge papers he vomited once more.\r\n\r\nAccording to McDowell, the vagus may possibly be incriminated as a\r\ncause of these gastric disturbances. Practically, the vomiting is a\r\nresult of emotional stress. The cure is to produce insight on the\r\npart of the patient, the removal of worry and the restoration of\r\nself-confidence.\r\n\r\nMichell Clarke cured such cases with milk diet.\r\n\r\nRoussy and Lhermitte find hysterical vomiting to be relatively common\r\nand as a rule without difficulty in diagnosis; but they remark that\r\nthere is often some underlying organic condition to be sought for and\r\ntreated after the neuropathic element has vanished. They remark, also,\r\nthat there is no tendency to spontaneous cure of the disease. They\r\nadvocate a strict dietetic régime and psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCure of self-accusatory (“started retreat from Mons”) and other\r\ndelusions by “autognosis.”\r\n\r\n=Case 496.= (BROWN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nCapt. William Brown, in the discussion at the Section of Psychiatry of\r\nthe Royal Society of Medicine, January 25, 1916, speaks of a method of\r\ntreatment which he calls _autognosis_--a method of giving the patient\r\nself-knowledge, by revealing to the patient through his own confessions\r\nthe cause of mental change leading to his symptoms. One of Brown’s\r\nexamples is that of a sergeant in the firing-line during the retreat\r\nfrom Mons. He was admitted to Maghull with the delusion that people\r\nthought he had given the signal for the retreat from Mons on a silver\r\nwhistle, a shooting prize of his. German officers used silver whistles\r\nthat made a note like his own. In fact, he had other like delusions,\r\nsuch as that people thought him responsible for an Edinburgh railroad\r\naccident in connection with his troop-train. A German spy might have\r\nheard this.\r\n\r\nIn the process of procuring autognosis, Capt. Brown found that at the\r\nage of 12 this man had been falsely accused of stealing pork pies from\r\na shop, and had been brought before a magistrate. In point of fact, he\r\nproved an alibi, but he was greatly worried by the charge. According to\r\nCapt. Brown, this incident of the insistence of the false accusation\r\nwas the beginning of his tendency to delusions. In two months’ time\r\nthere was a remarkable improvement.\r\n\r\n_Re_ psychoanalysis, autognosis and various modifications, Forsyth\r\nremarks that when the acute stage is passed, the Shell-shock case\r\nbecomes an everyday neurosis in which war experiences are merely the\r\nlatest phases in the patient’s life, and that psychoanalysis may then\r\nbecome necessary. Eder regards the “mechanisms” of what he terms “war\r\nshock” as the Freudian mechanisms of hysteria, and has commended\r\npsychoanalysis for a few cases, preferring hypnotism for acute\r\ncases. Adrian and Yealland decry psychoanalysis on the score of time\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeafmutism in three men shell-shocked at one time.\r\n\r\n=Cases 497, 498, 499.= (ROUSSY, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nThere were three Zouaves in a first-line trench north of Arras, January\r\n14, 1915, who were blown up by a bomb thrown from the enemy trench\r\nsome hundreds of meters away, by a mortar, a _crapouillaud_. This\r\nprojectile burst with a great noise, louder than that of a bomb, and\r\nmade a very strong windage. A dozen men were blown under the trench\r\nwall, just after entering the trench; two were killed; and the others,\r\nmost of whom had been buried to the neck, were pulled out and carried,\r\ntrembling, to the nearest relief post. Two of the three Zouaves were\r\nbleeding at nose and ears, and all three were absolutely deaf and\r\nmute. Evacuated to an ambulance, and thence to Paris, they arrived at\r\nVal-de-Grâce, January 17, that is to say, three days after the shell\r\nburst. They communicated with the attendants by signs; one got hold\r\nof paper and wrote several hours in the day rapid notes about the\r\naccident. However, hysteria or pure simulation was suspected in these\r\nthree Zouaves, and they were placed in small separate rooms. They\r\nwere informed through the physician’s remarks to his staff that these\r\nwere cases of nothing but simple nervous shock such as we had often\r\nobserved, and the claim was made that they would be completely well\r\neither on the morrow or the day after.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, two of them partially recovered hearing and got back\r\ntheir voices. They became loquacious and began to tell about the\r\nbattle. The day after, the third patient began to speak. Two of them\r\nshowed traces of auricular hemorrhage, and in fact, actual ear lesions\r\nwere found in all three. One had a suppurative right middle ear, with\r\nperforation; another had both drums perforated and a suppurative middle\r\near, also on both sides. The third, who recovered his speech after the\r\nothers, had perforation of the left tympanum with a little suppuration\r\nof the right ear tympanum and a slight tear of the right tympanum. In\r\nApril, 1915, the hearing was cured.\r\n\r\nThese men had been under fire several months, and had taken part in the\r\nbattle of the Marne. It was not a question of their first baptism of\r\nfire, and in fact, each of them had been previously wounded. According\r\nto Roussy, the story is, that the shell-burst produces by displacement\r\nof air tympanic perforation, and at the same time a violent nerve\r\nshock with loss of consciousness for a few minutes. The men come to,\r\nbut the ear lesion, probably exaggerated by the nervous status of its\r\nbearer, creates a complete bilateral deafness. This deafness produces\r\nan absolute hysterical mutism.\r\n\r\n_Re_ case groups of war neurosis, several writers speak of dangers\r\nof contagion, but also emphasize the values of contact of patients\r\nwith one another in the securing of therapeutic results. What\r\nMott has termed the _atmosphere of cure_ was no doubt present in\r\nthe three instances of Roussy just cited. The cure of one may act\r\nheterosuggestively to produce the cure of a second, and so on.\r\nFunctional deafmutes are somewhat refractory as a rule. H. Campbell\r\nstates that there is some danger attached to allowing large numbers\r\nof functional cases to consort together too closely. He suggests\r\nmaking use of small wards and screens, and a process of sorting out\r\npatients so that they shall not affect one another injuriously. Steiner\r\nespecially stresses the value of individual rooms in preventing psychic\r\ninfection, of which, he says, the danger is large in open dormitories.\r\nThe psychic contagion is as a rule that of hysterical seizures and\r\ntremors; but complaints about faulty hospital arrangements are also\r\nreadily spread. Steiner advocates never questioning a nervous patient\r\nconcerning his troubles in the presence of other soldiers. To reach 60\r\nto 70 patients, Steiner had one examining and treatment room. Roussy’s\r\ninstitution at Salins in 1917 had a service limited to traumatic\r\nhysteria, from which, in three months’ time, 200 subjects had been\r\ndischarged cured (see Boschi).\r\n\r\n\r\nDysentery: Milk diet persisted in: Vomiting, incontinence, inability to\r\nwalk. Cure by persuasion.\r\n\r\n=Case 500.= (MCDOWELL, December, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 25, a low menial when war broke out, developed “dysentery\r\nand gastritis” at the Dardanelles, although even before the dysentery\r\nhis nerves had gone bad. He had diarrhoea and vomiting, was sick every\r\nday, found himself unable to walk, and found himself always wet with\r\nurine dribbling day and night. Arriving in England and treated in a\r\nhospital, he still had vomiting. He had lived on milk and custard and\r\nbeen kept in bed.\r\n\r\nCapt. McDowell convinced the patient that his legs were not as weak as\r\nhe supposed. He was encouraged to walk, put upon light diet and then\r\nupon ordinary diet. He became an active worker in the ward, later going\r\nfor five-mile route marches. Two months later he went back to duty\r\nin good health, weighing seven pounds more than before. This man was\r\nweakminded and, when his dysentery was cured, did not dare to start\r\neating ordinary food. He was a victim of hospital régime. Individual\r\nattention would have obviated much of the subsequent state.\r\n\r\n_Re_ vomiting, see remarks under another case of McDowell (Case 495).\r\n\r\n_Re_ incontinence, see Case 384, of Guillain and Barré.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficer dies in convulsions: Servant develops hysterical convulsions,\r\nwhich vanish on being explained as such.\r\n\r\n=Case 501.= (HURST, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn officer and his servant were blown up by a shell. The servant ran to\r\nfetch a stretcher for the officer, to whom he was much attached, but\r\non his return the officer made a few convulsive movements and died.\r\nImmediately after, the servant had a fit. During the next two months he\r\nhad eleven more. Hurst made a diagnosis of hysterical fits resulting\r\nfrom emotion, explained his idea of their origin and nature to the\r\nservant, and the convulsions then ceased completely.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hysterical convulsions, see remarks under Case 443.\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse of a case with crises of trembling.\r\n\r\n=Case 502.= (ROUSSY, April, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in the artillery, who had been in the lines from August\r\nas a kitchenman, looking after the food of the first line trenches,\r\nwith which his shelter was connected by communication trenches, 800\r\nmeters away, was on January 17, 1915, with three other men placed in\r\nthe shelter kitchen of the trenches but a short distance away from\r\nthe French artillery. The firing passed over the heads of these men\r\nbut they could feel the windage, which obliged them to lie down each\r\ntime. The evening of that day, several hours after firing had ceased,\r\nthe kitchenman had a shivering spell, with trembling that lasted all\r\nnight; after which these crises came on every day. He had finally to be\r\nevacuated to the rear.\r\n\r\nAccording to Roussy, such patients always have neuropathic taint and\r\na history of previous crises. Such a patient ought to be handled\r\nwith rather severe discipline. In this way, according to Roussy, the\r\nreappearance of a severe attack of convulsions can be prevented. But\r\nthese patients cannot go back to the front.\r\n\r\n_Re_ tremors, see Cases 224 and 225.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo cases of lameness cured by persuasion: Russel.\r\n\r\n=Case 503.= (RUSSEL, August, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA man on crutches, paralyzed completely in the right leg, partially\r\nin the left, developed paralysis in the right arm from the use of the\r\ncrutch. There were marked vasomotor changes in the right leg and arm\r\ntogether with anesthesia to pinprick. Assured that he could move the\r\nlegs perfectly he said that he had tried and failed. After a persuasive\r\ntalk in private he began to use the arm, and to walk perfectly. It\r\nseems that in the trenches he had a sharp pain in the right knee, after\r\nwhich he did not use the leg and it gradually became more and more\r\nuseless. It had been paralyzed for three months. The reason he did not\r\nuse this leg was not on his own account, but on account of his mother\r\nat home. He seemed really grateful for the cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Case 504.= (RUSSEL, August, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant in hospital for a year for shell-shock still had a marked\r\nshaking of the right leg whenever he raised it from the ground. He\r\nwalked in leaning on a silver headed cane. The functional nature of\r\nhis shaking was explained to him by Russel, whereupon he walked out\r\nnormally saying he could do without his cane. Russel suggested that\r\ncrutches and sticks thus given up were often donated to the shrine. The\r\nsergeant whose cane must have cost at least three pounds beat a hasty\r\nretreat carrying the cane in front of him.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Russel’s general point of view concerning malingerers and\r\npsychogenic cases, see under Case 458.\r\n\r\n\r\nHard patrol work: Delirium; head tremor augmented by excitement:\r\nVirtual recovery on bandaging neck, isolation, open air, to-and-fro\r\ntransfers to mental and nervous wards.\r\n\r\n=Case 505.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA metal moulder in civil life, 29, in military service 1907 to 1909 (no\r\nhereditary taint, moderately good scholar), became unconscious for a\r\nhalf hour after taking a cold drink following a somewhat long practice\r\nmarch, at some time during his first year of military service.\r\n\r\nHe was in several skirmishes in Belgium and Northern France early in\r\nthe war, being once surrounded in patrol work (November 11) by Turcoes\r\nand Zouaves. There was a lively exchange of shots, in the course of\r\nwhich five of the eight men on patrol fell. The three survivors hid\r\nthemselves for three days in a quarry, and on the fourth were found by\r\nthe advancing troops, and immediately went into battle.\r\n\r\nBut during a pause while on the point of taking coffee, the man\r\nsuddenly fell sick, tried to carry on, but lost consciousness and\r\napparently remained unconscious for about three-quarters of an hour. It\r\nseems that he raved and shouted and tried to bite his fingers, being\r\nheld with great difficulty by several comrades. He was removed to a\r\ndressing-station three km. distant.\r\n\r\nAt the dressing-station, his head began to shake, although he was\r\nunaware of this until his attention was called to it by his comrades.\r\nHe said that he felt restless and that his head ached almost\r\ncontinually. He was carried to the reserve hospital, and from thence,\r\nDecember 9, 1914, to the nerve hospital at Jena, where he was unaware\r\nof the shaking of his head (which had now lasted for three weeks),\r\nand said that he felt a thick fog in his head (to say nothing of\r\nheadaches), and was only free and clear in his head while standing in\r\nthe open air.\r\n\r\nHis sleep was restless and poor; there were war dreams almost every\r\nnight. In the process of getting to sleep, his arms and legs frequently\r\ntwitched. He would soon tire and feel weak. Also since his dangerous\r\nexperience, he had noticed a change in his speech: always fluent\r\nbefore, it was now hard for him to speak because one had to exert one’s\r\nhead so much in speaking.\r\n\r\nThis head tremor was in fact the most marked symptom of his illness. It\r\nwould increase on every active motion of the head, but ceased almost\r\nentirely when attention was diverted. The head would then be held bent\r\nto the right.\r\n\r\nDuring emotional excitement, the shaking spasm would spread over the\r\nentire upper part of the body, but would remain more severe upon the\r\nright than upon the left side. The forearms would fall into a lively\r\nshaking movement of pronation and supination. The hands and fingers\r\nwould be attacked by a less marked tremor. After calm had set in,\r\na fine tremor of the right hand would remain plainly noticeable.\r\nThe musculature of facial expression would frequently fall into\r\nspasmodic movement, the left corner of the mouth twitching, the lips\r\nset for whistling, or the upper lip making movements as if snuffing\r\nspasmodically.\r\n\r\nPhysically the man was of medium height, strongly built, with adherent\r\nlobules, and a somewhat pointed skull. The teeth were defective and\r\nirregularly placed. Both deep and skin reflexes were increased. Marked\r\ndermatographia and mechanical excitability of the muscles: periosteal\r\nreflexes strongly developed; numerous pressure points in the head.\r\nThe right temple and back of the head were painful on percussion.\r\nThe patient showed no disturbance in touch and pain sensibility.\r\nOutstretched tongue showed marked fibrillary twitching; speech was\r\ndifficult, being slow, awkward, stumbling, and sometimes hesitating\r\n(suggesting the speech of general paresis). At other times, the speech\r\nwas of a peculiar sighing, tremulous nature, reminding one of the\r\nspeech of children complaining or asking for pity. Rest was secured\r\nby injections of salt solution. A few days later, the treatment was\r\ncontinued by a bandage about the neck. After this the tremor grew\r\nslighter and would even remain absent for some hours. The patient\r\nwas told to rest in bed and not to speak much; being “seriously ill,”\r\nhe was kept alone. He was often irritated, querulous, and subject to\r\noutbursts of profanity. He took food well and slept well, receiving\r\nsodium bicarbonate.\r\n\r\nThe bandage was changed after five days. The tremor was very marked.\r\nThe patient was furious because visitors were refused to him. He\r\nwas especially angry with his nearest relatives and his betrothed,\r\nand wrote defiant letters to all of them. He became one of the most\r\ntroublesome patients in the psychiatric division of the hospital. He\r\ncomplained sometimes of anxiety and feelings of unrest. He received\r\ntreatment by pantopon. He continued to be a very disagreeable patient,\r\nfeeling himself opposed and not properly considered. He thought himself\r\nseriously ill, behaved much like a spoiled child, and was of the\r\nopinion that he would not get well in the hospital because they were\r\ngrieving him so. His appetite became bad; he complained of pains in the\r\nloins and of rheumatism in the legs. A cord was found hidden in the\r\nbed. The patient expressed suicidal thoughts at various times.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of January there was marked improvement. The\r\nheadshaking ceased almost entirely; the patient walked in the garden\r\nsome hours daily. However, in the middle of January, on refusal of\r\nfurlough, the head-shaking began again markedly. At his request\r\na bandage was placed on the head again for a few days. He seemed\r\nemotionally very tender; his head would shake at the sight of a dead\r\nrabbit.\r\n\r\nHe was transferred to the nerve division of the psychiatric clinic at\r\nthe end of January. He had recently begun to complain of flickering\r\nbefore the eyes. The ophthalmologists established an existence of a\r\nchoroiditis disseminata. The eye examination had a markedly depressing\r\neffect upon the patient, and the shaking spasm of the head appeared\r\nagain. Upon being told that he would have to be sent back to the\r\npsychiatric section of the clinic, the shaking immediately disappeared\r\n(24 hours after it had begun).\r\n\r\nThereafter slow improvement followed. He stayed in the open a great\r\ndeal and walked. March 2, he showed a vehement outburst of anger,\r\nquarreling and using violence with a comrade. He was brought back to\r\nthe psychiatric section, and in transit had a severe hysterical attack\r\nwith unconsciousness, crying fits, and stepping movements of the\r\nextremities. He was promptly taken to a section for those seriously\r\nill. The next day, upon his assurance that he could control himself, he\r\nwas put in a more quiet division. He began to take part in gymnastic\r\nexercises, worked as a coachman, and then as an experiment was sent to\r\na gentleman’s estate for recreation. At last accounts he was feeling\r\nwell except that he occasionally had headaches during work. He could\r\nnot work so hard as before on account of the rapid onset of fatigue,\r\nespecially when working in the sun. The head-shaking recurred but\r\nseldom and lasted for a few hours only when the patient became angry or\r\nwhen there was much noise about.\r\n\r\n\r\nRationalization of war memories: Returned to duty.\r\n\r\n=Case 506.= (RIVERS, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\nA young English officer was wounded just as he was extricating himself\r\nfrom burial in a mass of earth. He became nervous and sleepless and\r\nlost his appetite. After the wound had healed, he was sent home on\r\nleave, which had to be extended as he got worse. An out-patient in\r\nLondon for a time, he was finally sent to a convalescent home, still\r\ntroubled with insomnia, battle dreams and concern about his recovery.\r\nHe made light of his condition and was on the point of being returned\r\nto duty by the medical board, when his sleeplessness led to his being\r\nsent to Craighlochart War Hospital.\r\n\r\nHe could not sleep without a light in the room, else every sound\r\nattracted his attention. He tried hard all day long to banish all\r\nunpleasant and disturbing thoughts, but at night it took him a long\r\ntime to get to sleep and then came vivid dreams of warfare. He did not,\r\nhimself, feel that he could ever forget the war scenes.\r\n\r\nRivers, in general believing that the attempt to banish such\r\nexperiences absolutely from the mind is poor psychotherapy, narrated\r\nhis views to the patient. Rivers advised him no longer to try to\r\nbanish the memories, but to try to transform them into tolerable,\r\nif not pleasant, companions. The war experiences and anxieties were\r\ntalked over. That night the man had the best night he had had for five\r\nmonths, and during the following week the sleeplessness was no longer\r\nso painful and distressing. If unpleasant thoughts came, they had to\r\ndo rather with home life than with the war. General health improved;\r\ninsomnia diminished. He was at last able to return to duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nRationalization of war memories.\r\n\r\n=Case 507.= (RIVERS, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\nAn English officer was buried by shell explosion and developed severe\r\nheadache, vomiting and disorder of micturition, yet remained on duty\r\nfor more than two months. Collapse came when he went out to seek a\r\nfellow officer and found the body blown to pieces, with head and limbs\r\nsevered from the trunk. This vision haunted him in dreams. Sometimes\r\nthe officer appeared as on the battlefield; again as leprous. The\r\nofficer would come nearer and nearer in the dream, until the patient\r\nwoke pouring with sweat and in utmost terror. Accordingly, he was\r\nafraid to go to sleep, and spent all day thinking painfully about the\r\nnight to come. Advice to keep all thoughts of war out of mind merely\r\nbrought the memories in sleep upon him with redoubled force and horror.\r\n\r\nRivers’ therapy was to draw attention to the fact that the terrible\r\nmangling proved conclusively that the officer had been killed outright\r\nand without pain. The officer said he would now no longer attempt to\r\nbanish the thoughts and memories of his friend, but would concentrate\r\non the pain and suffering his friend had been spared. No dreams at all\r\ncame for several nights, but one night in his dream he went out into\r\nNo-Man’s-Land and saw the mangled body, but without horror. He knelt\r\ndown, as he had in the original experience, and woke as he was taking\r\noff the Sam Browne belt to send to the relatives. A few nights later\r\ncame another dream in which he talked with his friend. There was but\r\none more dream in which horror occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nRationalization of war memories: Eventually unfitted for military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n=Case 508.= (RIVERS, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\nA young English officer, after doing well for a period, was rendered\r\nunconscious by shell explosion. The first thing he remembered was being\r\nled by his servant towards his base, thoroughly broken down. He had\r\nheadaches, sleeplessness, war dreams and spells of terrible depression\r\nappearing with absolute suddenness, unlike ordinary “blues.” For ten\r\ndays in hospital no such attack appeared, but one evening he came to\r\nRivers pale and anxious. A few minutes before, he had been writing\r\na letter in his usual mood, when this causeless depression came on.\r\nIn the afternoon he had walked about on some neighboring hills. The\r\nletter dealt with no depressing matter. In ten minutes the depression\r\nvanished. Nine days later another came as he was standing idly looking\r\nout of a window. The attack lasted for several hours, as no physician\r\nwas present to meet the issue. If he had had a revolver he would have\r\nshot himself.\r\n\r\nRivers was inclined to interpret these gusts of depression as due to a\r\nforgotten but active experience. As there was no definite tendency to\r\ndissociation, Rivers hesitated to plunge in with the hypnotic method,\r\nnothing short of which, however, served to recall the incident. The man\r\nwas gravely apprehensive about fitness for further service, and was\r\nrepressing his fear, as he thought it either was cowardice or would\r\nbe called cowardice. The patient, by his discussions with Rivers, had\r\nalready become familiar with the idea that the gusts of depression\r\nmight be due to a submerged experience. Perhaps, however, there had\r\nbeen no experience, and the patient was advised that possibly the thing\r\nrepressed was the idea about fitness for service. Accordingly, the\r\npatient agreed to face the situation. One transient attack of morbid\r\ndepression occurred, after an operation. Then the man fell into a state\r\nof anxiety neurosis such that he was passed by a medical board as unfit\r\nfor military service.\r\n\r\n\r\nRationalization of war memories: Commission relinquished.\r\n\r\n=Case 509.= (RIVERS, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\nAn oldish English officer lost consciousness while looking at the havoc\r\nwrought by shell explosion. Probably there was a second shell that sent\r\nhim off. He was eventually admitted to an English hospital with paresis\r\nand anesthesia of legs, severe headache, sleeplessness and terrifying\r\ndreams. Hypnotic drugs and advice neither to read nor to talk about\r\nthe war were the measures adopted and after two months in hospital he\r\nwas given three months leave. He buried himself in the heart of the\r\ncountry, away from relatives, with aspirin and bromides. He began to\r\nsleep better and had less headache. When the president of the medical\r\nboard asked a question about trenches at the end of his period of\r\nleave, however, he broke down and wept. He again repaired to the\r\ncountry for two months’ leave, for the chosen treatment by isolation\r\nand repression.\r\n\r\nAn order was then given that all officers must be either in hospital or\r\non duty. He was sent to an inland watering place and treated by baths,\r\nelectricity and massage, whereupon he rapidly became worse, especially\r\nas to sleep. He was transferred to Craiglochart in an emaciated state,\r\nwith an expression of anxiety and dread, paresis of legs, sleeplessness\r\nand war dreams.\r\n\r\nHe was now advised to give up repressing, to read and talk a little\r\nabout the war, and to accustom himself to thinking about war\r\nexperiences. He did this but half-heartedly, as he thought the ideal\r\ntreatment was what he had so long followed. Nevertheless, he got\r\ndistinctly better and the content of the war dreams was altered to home\r\nscenes. He was still loath to acknowledge his improvement and thought\r\nthat he would have recovered if he had not been taken from his retreat\r\nand sent to hospital. As it was obvious that he would be of no further\r\nuse in the army, he was allowed to relinquish his commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nRationalization of war memories, without redeeming feature as nucleus.\r\n\r\n=Case 510.= (RIVERS, February, 1918.)\r\n\r\nAn English officer was flung by shell explosion so that his face struck\r\nthe ruptured and distended abdomen of a dead German. The officer\r\ndid not immediately lose consciousness and got distinct impressions\r\nof taste and smell and an idea of their source. After a period of\r\nunconsciousness he came to, vomiting and much shaken. He carried on\r\nseveral days, still troubled by vomiting and haunted by taste and\r\nsmell images. Several months later he was observed by Rivers suffering\r\nfrom horrible dreams, in which the battle experience was faithfully\r\nreproduced. He got no relief except when he went into the country,\r\nfar from every suggestion of war. Rivers’ psychotherapeutic plan of\r\nfinding a redeeming feature in the experience, upon which the patient\r\nmight concentrate, failed because there was no redeeming feature.\r\nAccordingly, it was thought best that the man should leave the army and\r\nseek the conditions that had given him slight relief.\r\n\r\n_Re_ psychoanalysis and its modifications, see remarks under Case\r\n496, under which several favorable opinions were mentioned. Boschi\r\nin his report on French conditions gives no reference concerning\r\npsychoanalysis or hypnosis. Bruce has found blended with the war dreams\r\nmany episodes quite alien to the war, and considers that the patient’s\r\nante-bellum history is of importance, since ante-bellum emotions may\r\nbe revivified by the war. Craig states that he has not been impressed\r\nfavorably by the results of psychoanalytic treatment. Arinstein from\r\nRussian experience gives preference to Dubois’ psychotherapy over\r\nhypnosis and psychoanalysis. Nonne states that the data of the war\r\nprove that hysteria is neither a degenerative disease according to\r\nclassical theory, nor a disease based upon Freudian principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost rheumatic “paraplegia” (or abulia?) cured by removal of crutches,\r\nafter question of discharge “unfit” had been raised.\r\n\r\n=Case 511.= (VEALE, November, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 23, had fever with swelling of several joints and\r\ntemperature in 1915, and was furloughed to England. He complained of\r\npains in the limbs and shortness of breath, and was put in hospital.\r\nAs he did not improve, he was sent to a special hospital for baths and\r\nelectricity. There he remained from August, 1915, to March, 1916, with\r\nD’Arsonval baths, cataphoresis, electric treatment and massage.\r\n\r\nHe was now sent to the second Northern General Hospital to see whether\r\nhe should be discharged permanently unfit. Here he shuffled along\r\non two crutches, very tremulous, and sweating, and suffering from\r\npalpitation on exertion. He wanted to take poison if he could not be\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nThe crutches were taken away. He was asked to walk up and down. He had\r\nto be supported at first and fell several times. The exercises were\r\ncontinued. Massage and drugging were stopped. The next day he was able\r\nto stand alone. In twenty-four hours he walked by himself. The other\r\npatients in the ward encouraged him on account of the genuine exertions\r\nhe was making to get well. April 7, he returned to duty, smart and well\r\nset up.\r\n\r\nBabinski and Froment always give the suspected subject the benefit\r\nof the doubt, never uttering the word simulation in the presence\r\nof the soldier, and proceed to psychotherapy; for psychotherapy\r\nwill act to cure simulation or exaggeration just as it acts to cure\r\nhysteria. They say that in their experience, all these disorders of\r\ndoubtful nature--that is, that lie diagnostically between hysteria,\r\nexaggeration, and simulation--are as a rule cured by resort to\r\npsychotherapy provided that the due amount of energy, tact, and\r\nperseverance is employed. See also remarks under Case 453. Veale’s case\r\n(511) never showed _mauvaise volonté_, and nothing more than aboulia.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Trench foot,” “neuritis,” a year of astasia-abasia or at least of\r\ncomplaint of inability to stand or walk. Treatment by a “cruel though\r\njustifiable” process.\r\n\r\n=Case 512.= (VEALE, November, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA regular army man, 38, well built and muscular, in Flanders the\r\nfirst winter, returned to England in January, 1915, with “trench\r\nfoot.” “Neuritis” then developed, with loss of power to walk. Baths,\r\nelectricity, massage, sympathetic wheeling about in a chair by women,\r\nall failed.\r\n\r\nJanuary 11, 1916, he still complained of inability to walk or stand.\r\nThe reflexes were exaggerated. He was able to get into a wheel chair\r\nfrom bed by jerks, associated with palpitation, tremors, flushing and\r\nsweating.\r\n\r\nHe was told that he had now recovered from the neuritis. Crutches,\r\nsticks and wheelchair were removed. He flopped about and then lay on\r\nthe bed exhausted. In a few days he began to shuffle about and was\r\nput on the stationary bicycle. January 29, he left the hospital well,\r\nremarking that though the treatment at first seemed cruel, it was fully\r\njustified.\r\n\r\n_Re_ genuine polyneuritis, Mann gives German experience regarding\r\nneuritis as somewhat frequent and affecting a special form which\r\nhe terms polyneuritis neurasthenica. He states that the commonest\r\ninstances of mononeuritis developing in the war are the sciatic and\r\ntrigeminal. The neuritis often outlasts the other symptoms. The\r\ntreatment was rest, tepid baths, and electricity. Naturally, alcohol\r\nand syphilis must be excluded in the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nNonne also described non-alcoholic, non-syphilitic, and non-infectious\r\npolyneuritis in neurasthenics, which he, however, finds most common in\r\nthe ulnar, median, radial, anterior crural and posterior tibial nerves.\r\n\r\n_Re_ “spa” treatment, Turner thinks there may be easily too much\r\nmassage, electricity, bathing. He prefers segregation in special\r\nhospitals to “spa” measures in general hospitals, prefers occupation to\r\nrest, and calls attention to the stimulating value of the gratuity to\r\nbe paid on leaving the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock paraplegia: Treatment by bed, cigarettes and chocolates\r\naltered to isolation, no tobacco, no visitors, faradization. Recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 513.= (BUZZARD, December, 1916.)\r\n\r\nEarly in the war, a lad, 19, was blown up by a shell. He was sent home\r\nparalyzed from waist down, and was seen by Capt. Buzzard after he had\r\nspent ten months in various hospitals, “carefully nursed, on the water\r\nbed, constantly using a bed urinal, smoking innumerable cigarettes,\r\nand eating countless chocolates.” He could not move his legs. They\r\nwere wasted and flaccid. The knee-jerks could be got with difficulty.\r\nPlantar reflexes flexor. Complete anesthesia from umbilicus downwards,\r\nbut preservation of abdominal reflexes. The navel did not shift\r\ndownwards when the patient attempted to sit up. The incontinence was\r\nnot real; urine was passed into the urinal at appropriate intervals.\r\n\r\nBuzzard directed treatment “not to his spinal cord but to his mind;\r\nisolation; the stoppage of tobacco and all visits; the assurance that\r\nhe would rapidly get well, together with some suggestive faradization\r\nof his legs.” This brought about a cure in a very short period. The\r\natrophied legs eventually grew strong enough to walk.\r\n\r\n_Re_ cigarettes in Shell-shock, Mott decries the over-liberal gifts of\r\ncigarettes that induced cigarette habits in both officers and men. Of\r\ncourse, the cigarettes are still more detrimental to cases of soldier’s\r\nheart than to other cases of neurosis. Mott remarks how over-frequent\r\nare the social tea-parties, joy rides and drives given by well-meaning\r\nladies for the “poor dears,” actually perpetuating neuroses.\r\n\r\n_Re_ atrophy, Babinski and Froment again bring up the question whether\r\nmuscular atrophy can be brought about by a hysterical motor disorder.\r\nIn point of fact, Charcot and Babinski were the first to describe\r\nthe true hysterical amyotrophy, but this hysterical amyotrophy is\r\nexceptional in hysterical paralysis, and is slight when it occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock blindness, mutism, deafness: Blindness spontaneously\r\nvanished, 24 hours. Mutism, 2-3 months. Deafness cured by “small\r\noperation.”\r\n\r\n=Case 514.= (HURST, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA lance corporal, 26, became blind, deaf and dumb, though without\r\nlosing consciousness, when blown up by a shell, August 29, 1916. His\r\nsight returned next day. On reaching England he talked in his sleep.\r\nEncouragement, electricity, etherization failed to effect improvement.\r\nOne night in November he woke up and asked the sister for a drink;\r\nthereafter he talked normally.\r\n\r\nSeven months after the shell explosion he was transferred to the\r\nneurological section at Netley, March 21, 1917. Deaf to air and bone\r\nconduction, a loud noise behind him caused a slight tremor of hands,\r\nwith blinking and dilatation of pupils; but further stimuli of the same\r\nsort failed to produce such reactions. Normal nystagmus and giddiness\r\non functional tests of vestibular nerve and canals. The internal ear\r\nwas then probably free from organic changes. Since shell-shock mutism\r\nis always hysterical, it was probable that the deafness was hysterical.\r\nUnder hypnosis (staring at lines for fifteen seconds) he showed no\r\nchange. During natural sleep, also, a shout of “Fire” and metallic\r\nnoises failed to wake the patient or to produce contraction of eyelids.\r\nElectric suggestion (despite the patient’s belief in electricity) and\r\nreëducation failed.\r\n\r\nApril 16, he was told that a small operation would have to be done\r\nApril 20. To this he readily consented. Two small incisions were made\r\nbehind the ear under light ether and suture was inserted. A loud noise\r\nwas made during the “operation”; he heard this noise and jumped from\r\nthe table. To his intense delight normal hearing returned in a few\r\nminutes. Next day hearing was tested and found normal to air and bone\r\nconduction. He was discharged to duty three weeks later and on his way\r\nto France, June 29, demonstrated his normal hearing to the physicians.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeafness: cure by stimulating vestibular apparatus.\r\n\r\n=Case 515.= (O’MALLEY, May, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private, 20 years of age, lost speech and hearing after the battle\r\nof Neuve Chapelle. Eight days later he came under the care of the\r\nlaryngologist in a very excited state, pointing to lips and ears and\r\ncarrying a note with information concerning his deafmutism.\r\n\r\nDr. O’Malley wrote on a piece of paper that he would restore the\r\npatient’s speech and hearing. Dr. O’Malley then used the mirror until\r\nthe point of retching, and wrote, “You can speak now; count up to ten\r\nloudly.” He did.\r\n\r\nDr. O’Malley next used the cold water douche to the right ear to\r\nthe point of giddiness, then shouting through a speaking-tube (see\r\ndescription below). The patient then found he could hear and the tears\r\nstreamed down his face. Thereafter he was able to converse freely. Dr.\r\nO’Malley writes:\r\n\r\n    The treatment of functional deafness consists in exciting the\r\n    vestibular apparatus as follows. Cold or hot water is allowed\r\n    to flow in a steady stream into and out of the external\r\n    auditory meatus by means of a tube attached to a receptacle\r\n    placed about one and a half to two feet above the patient’s\r\n    head and continued until he becomes very giddy and an active\r\n    nystagmus is produced. A speaking-tube three feet long is then\r\n    used by placing the ear-piece in the ear so treated, and the\r\n    surgeon shouts into the mouth-piece the assertion, “You hear\r\n    now,” and the answer, “Yes” comes promptly. The tube is now\r\n    dropped and a conversation held as if no deafness ever existed.\r\n    So far I have found the treatment of one ear sufficient. The\r\n    patient is usually very emotional, as the disturbed vestibular\r\n    function, which in these cases responds easily and markedly,\r\n    causes him to feel as uncomfortable as a bad sailor on a\r\n    stormy voyage. This feeling, however, rapidly gives way to one\r\n    of pleasure at the return of his hearing. Where functional\r\n    deafness and mutism co-exist it does not appear to be material\r\n    which is treated first. In two cases of this kind under my care\r\n    I treated the loss of voice first.\r\n\r\n\r\nBullet through mouth; Hysterical mutism. Treatment by operative\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\n=Case 516.= (MORESTIN, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Colonial infantryman, 32, was wounded December 17, 1914, at the\r\nBoisselle, being struck by a bullet which entered on the right side in\r\nthe upper part of the neck and came out behind the left side of the\r\nmouth, having traversed the tongue, broken two teeth, and caused a\r\ngood deal of hemorrhage by mouth. The patient felt his tongue swell,\r\nand from this time on he could not pronounce a word. He was sent to\r\nthe ambulance, then to Mien, then to Saint Germain, and finally to\r\nMorestin’s surgical service. With wounds by this time healed, the\r\npatient found it hard to open his mouth. There was no trace of fracture\r\nof the lower jaw. The tongue could be only incompletely examined. The\r\nman swallowed liquids easily but could take no solid food. He tried\r\nhard to speak, made pantomime movements, grew emotional and lachrymose.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, it seemed that his inability to articulate\r\nsound could not be due directly to the lesion. There must be either\r\nsimulation or hysteria. For four days he was attentively watched, and\r\nnot once did he pronounce a word. He grew more and more stricken and\r\nhumiliated by his plight. Rigorous diet did not cause his mutism to\r\ncease. Isolation and ennui did not decide him to talk. Accordingly,\r\nit was announced, in the man’s hearing, that an operation was to be\r\ndone to restore speech. January 9, 1915, his face was copiously washed\r\nwith alcohol and ether. Cocaine was injected to secure anesthesia and\r\nresolution of the muscles of mastication. Six c.c. of a 1-100 solution\r\non each side. Shortly the surgeon began to open the jaws, against\r\ndecreasing resistance. The tongue, which was not spastic, was seized\r\nwith a tractor and rhythmic movements were executed with it. After a\r\nfew of these movements, joy was painted on the features of the patient.\r\nHe said that he wanted to speak and that he was about to speak. He\r\nshook the surgeon’s hands effusively and said, “_Merci_.” Although\r\nthe first words came hard, little by little speech became free and a\r\nperfectly sincere elation at having recovered speech set in.\r\n\r\nThis man was neuropathic, having always been a rather strange,\r\nirritable and restless person, and given to nervous crises in anger, in\r\nwhich he lost consciousness entirely.\r\n\r\n_Re_ pseudo operations as forms of disguised persuasion, almost\r\ncountless methods have been used. See Cases 514, 515, 518, 519,\r\nespecially 521, 560, 561. Sham injections under ethyl chloride have\r\nbeen made (Goldstein). See also under Case 484, _re_ continuous bath,\r\nand under Case 488, _re_ lumbar puncture. Very close to these methods\r\nare the methods of _torpillage_ of Vincent and the methods employed by\r\nYealland in England and Kaufmann in Germany. See under Cases 574, 563,\r\nand 564, and 570.\r\n\r\nLéri quotes Babinski as saying, “We cannot fight hysteria in trench\r\nwarfare; manoeuvres are necessary.”\r\n\r\n_Re_ treatment of mutism, Chavigny remarks that the principle of\r\ntreatment for mutism is quite different from the principles of\r\ntreatment of paralysis. The reëducation of mutism is psychic. Chavigny\r\nclaims probably absolute success in the treatment of mutism through\r\nfaradism to the larynx region simultaneously with a signal given to the\r\npatient to make an effort to pronounce the letter A. Garel modifies the\r\ntreatment (in case the faradic apparatus is not at hand), by a vigorous\r\nand sudden blow to the patient’s epigastrium simultaneously with the\r\npatient’s endeavor to imitate the movement of the doctor’s lips.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Impairment of vision (even commanded men to fire on\r\nkindred troops!) Improvement by verbal suggestion, faradization,\r\ninjections.\r\n\r\n=Case 517.= (MILLS, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant-major, 29, in private life a bookkeeper, said that shrapnel\r\nstruck the ground in front of him and burst as it struck. Unconscious\r\nfor a moment, the sergeant-major thereafter saw everything imperfectly,\r\nled his men in the wrong direction, and even commanded them to fire in\r\nthe direction of his own troops.\r\n\r\nSeven days afterwards the eyes looked normal, fundi were normal, vision\r\nwas reduced to the perception of hand movements; with a plus 10 sphere\r\nthe right eye could count fingers at 5 c.m. and with a plus 8 sphere\r\nthe left eye could count fingers at 3 c.m. There was a right frontal\r\nanalgesia.\r\n\r\nTreatment: Sweating; rest in bed for several weeks; assurance of\r\ncomplete recovery. There was a slow but constant improvement, aided by\r\nfaradization and injections of strychnine sulphate into the temporal\r\nregion, but the prospect of a return to the front retarded the\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\n_Re_ injections into the temple, see also Case 521 of Bruce. _Re_ cure\r\nof blindness, Grasset has a case of a blind deafmute who was cured\r\nby a nurse. She put a pencil in his hand and guided the pencil while\r\nshe wrote a question. The patient replied in very good MSS. In blind\r\ndeafmutes sight is described as returning first, hearing next, and\r\nspeech last.\r\n\r\nFor other cases of blindness, see especially under Section C, Cases 433\r\nto 438, with discussions thereunder.\r\n\r\n_Re_ retardation of improvement by the prospect of further military\r\nservice, Lewandowski has insisted upon the strong factor of the wish in\r\nall such functional conditions. Lewandowski wants all functional cases,\r\nhowever, to be sent to duty in the rear or to be discharged as unfit.\r\n\r\n\r\nAphonia: manipulation in larynx.\r\n\r\n=Case 518.= (O’MALLEY, May, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA corporal, 28, had a bullet pass through his neck from a point in the\r\nmiddle line at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage to a point\r\nbehind the right sternomastoid muscle, two inches below the point of\r\nentry. The corporal lost his voice at the time of injury, spat up a\r\nteaspoonful of blood, and thereafter was able to whisper only. The\r\nlaryngoscopic examination betrayed no intralaryngeal lesion. Treatment\r\nas described below enabled the patient to speak. O’Malley describes his\r\ntechnique as follows:\r\n\r\n    The patient is placed in the common position for the\r\n    examination of the larynx, the tip of the tongue being\r\n    seized in a piece of linen by the left hand fingers and the\r\n    laryngeal mirror introduced with the right hand. The patient\r\n    is then requested to say “e” or cough, and if the cords do\r\n    not approximate, they can be made to do so by using moderate\r\n    friction on the fauces and pharynx with the mirror to excite\r\n    secretion. The latter begins to drop into the larynx, and\r\n    acting as a foreign body, a protective reflex is at once\r\n    excited which adducts the cords to prevent the secretion from\r\n    entering the trachea. At the same time an involuntary cough\r\n    is produced to expel the mucus, and if the friction and flow\r\n    of secretion are maintained and the patient is urged to cough\r\n    vigorously, voluntary coughing and a tendency to retching with\r\n    forced laryngeal notes will rapidly follow. It is usually\r\n    best to persist until retching occurs, as the cords are then\r\n    forced together to protect the larynx and trachea from the\r\n    possible entrance of regurgitated stomach contents. Involuntary\r\n    laryngeal sounds are thus produced and the patient is conscious\r\n    of laryngeal effort. Some of these cases are at the moment\r\n    very shallow breathers, which can be demonstrated by X-ray\r\n    screening, but the act of retching causes a wide excursion\r\n    of the diaphragm with a more pronounced expiratory blast,\r\n    to be rapidly followed by deeper inspirations. This method\r\n    of treatment is best carried out just before a meal, as the\r\n    stomach is then practically empty and the unpleasant effects\r\n    of the sudden regurgitation of food are avoided. When the\r\n    explosive sounds accompanying retching have occurred two or\r\n    three times the mirror is withdrawn, the tongue released, and\r\n    the patient is requested to swallow, take a deep breath, and\r\n    cough, and then urged to count up to ten, directing his voice\r\n    to a certain point on the ceiling. This method has given me\r\n    uniformly good results, and was rapidly effective in all cases\r\n    coming under treatment soon after the onset of the neurosis.\r\n\r\n_Re_ methods for curing aphonia, Muck has a method called the “ball”\r\nmethod. A ball is put into the larynx to cause a temporary suffocation,\r\nwhich produces a reflex that starts the adductors. He would apply\r\nthe method as soon as the man was well over the shock that produced\r\naphonia. Muck states that he has applied the ball method, not only to\r\ncases of aphonia, but to cases of mutism and deafness, with success.\r\n\r\nTilly mentions a case in which the patient refused to open his mouth,\r\nso the device was adopted of passing an electrode through the left\r\nnostril so that it finally reached the larynx. A spasm was produced,\r\nwhich was carried to the point of considerable cyanosis, but the\r\naphonia was relieved and for the first time in three months the man\r\nspoke. Incidentally he began to hear also.\r\n\r\n_Re_ treatment of aphonia, Schultz has used the electric current\r\nexternally over the larynx, all the while carrying on a laryngoscopy.\r\nSchultz remarks upon the fatigue that may come during the first few\r\nsittings. Roussy and Lhermitte remark that, although aphonia sometimes\r\nexists from the outset of shock, it is often a phase in recovery from\r\nmutism.\r\n\r\nLiébault notes that, not only cases of true nervous aphonia but cases\r\nof laryngitis, apparently of infectious origin, and cases of true voice\r\nstrain, may also turn up for treatment. Some men have been improperly\r\ndischarged from the army for aphonia actually due to voice strain.\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical aphonia in a mechanician (war time contributory?). Cure by\r\nsuggestive manipulation of larynx.\r\n\r\n=Case 519.= (VLASTO, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA mechanician was refitting an engine valve, when steam was suddenly\r\nput on and the drains were opened out. Some of the steam entered the\r\nthroat of the mechanician, who rushed up, gasping, unable to speak.\r\nOedema of the larynx was thought of; but there was no complaint except\r\nthe inability to speak.\r\n\r\nA month later he was discharged to the hospital ship at Plassy, where\r\nhe got faradic treatment, the effect of which was to cause him pain\r\nwithout recovery of voice. The man could whisper well enough and\r\ncough fairly loudly. The vocal cords of the larynx appeared normal\r\non laryngoscopic examination, but adduction of the cords was not be\r\nproperly effected. He was now given rest and constant assurances that\r\nhe would get well.\r\n\r\nTen days later, another laryngoscopic examination was made, with mild\r\nmechanical stimulation of the air passage. The patient remarked that\r\nhe had never been so near being able to speak since his dumbness came\r\non. The patient was now informed that his muscle of talking was going\r\nto be replaced and that the success of the operation depended upon his\r\nhelp, so that he was to shout out as soon as he became conscious of\r\nthe physician’s working inside his throat. The patient was given ether\r\nlightly, into the second stage. When consciousness was about to return,\r\nthe laryngeal mirror was placed lightly on the larynx. The patient was\r\ncommanded and encouraged to count out loud and shout. Speech returned\r\npermanently.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that there was no specific war effect underlying\r\nthe phenomena, unless we regard the fact of its being war time as\r\ncontributory to the shock produced by an incident in every day engine\r\nroom duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nGradual onset of mutism and amnesia without special occasion. Faradism.\r\nDream.\r\n\r\n=Case 520.= (SMYLY, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was slightly wounded in the arm and returned to the trenches.\r\nLater he found himself in hospital at Boulogne, unable to speak and\r\nunable to remember what had happened to him from the time he was in\r\nthe trenches. It appears that his voice and memory had gradually\r\ndisappeared, according to what was told him by his comrades.\r\n\r\nA month afterward, in a London hospital, the patient was roused\r\nsuddenly from sleep, and then proved able to speak, although there was\r\ngreat difficulty in getting each word out. Two months later, he went to\r\nbed, feeling indisposed, in the night had a kind of fit, and remained\r\nunconscious until the following night; the next morning, his voice was\r\nagain lost. The aphonia persisted for a fortnight, and the patient\r\ncould hear only loud shouting when close to his ear. He was anxious\r\nto get well and requested electricity from the physician, Dr. Smyly,\r\nhaving heard probably of another case cured thereby. Dr. Smyly applied\r\nfaradic current to the larynx externally, instructing the patient to\r\nblow at the same time. At first the patient spoke so low that he could\r\nnot hear himself speak, but on suggestion succeeded in speaking up\r\nloudly enough. He was shortly able to speak and hearing improved. The\r\nclimax arrived with a bad dream one night, from which the patient awoke\r\nin a fright and found himself able to hear and speak perfectly.\r\n\r\n_Re_ nocturnal spontaneous cures, see observations by Mott under Case\r\n473. Note also in this case the presence of what Mott has termed “the\r\natmosphere of cure.”\r\n\r\n_Re_ relapses, see Case 476 as well as remarks under Case 474. _Re_\r\nspecial cases of mutism, Goldstein has insisted upon a greater\r\nindividualization of treatment for functional mutes than even for\r\nother neurotics, and advocates the establishment of schools within\r\nthe hospitals and aftercare institutions. He thinks the problem very\r\nserious.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock blindness: Cure by a course of injections in the temple.\r\n\r\n=Case 521.= (BRUCE, May, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier from Gallipoli was admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital\r\nat Edinburgh, blind. He had been at Gallipoli from May 1, 1915, until\r\nAugust 12, when a shell explosion blew in his trench and buried him.\r\nHe was dug out nervous and tremulous. Shortly afterwards there was\r\nthe bright flash of a second shell, and amnesia set in until he found\r\nhimself in hospital. He could not see at all with the left eye and the\r\nsight of the other was poor. He arrived in Scotland, October 9. He was\r\nnervous, excitable and now somewhat depressed, complaining of blindness\r\nand pain in the left eye, and headache. The left eyelid drooped. The\r\nfundus was normal. He had not been given an anesthetic.\r\n\r\nIt was explained to him that the eye had not been injured; that it had\r\nbecome weak from the explosion; that he would be given a series of\r\ninjections into the left temple of a strong drug which would restore\r\nthe sight of the eye.\r\n\r\nGradually increasing quantities of normal saline solution were given\r\nevery morning. After four days he said that the treatment was doing\r\nhim good. A week later he said that the eye was much stronger. After\r\nthe fifteenth injection he could not sleep. The headache was worse,\r\nand there was “moving about inside his head.” Early in the morning he\r\nwent to sleep after a period of restlessness. He awoke at eight o’clock\r\nable to see perfectly, and was overjoyed at the result. There was some\r\nblurring and four days later he said he was becoming blind again. More\r\nnormal saline was injected, causing pain. After that there was no\r\nrelapse, and the man was sent back to his unit.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Shell-shock blindness, Ormond and Hurst recommend a light\r\nhypnosis; taking the functionally blind man into a dark room and\r\nrequesting him to make his mind a blank. Some cases are refractory. An\r\nanesthetic may be used with suggestion in the semi-conscious stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeafness, cured by suggestion in writing.\r\n\r\n=Case 522.= (BUSCAINO and COPPOLA, 1916.)\r\n\r\nL. G., 20 years old; fusileer. (Mother of neuropathic constitution.\r\nFather died in 50th year of heart disease. One brother had hemiparesis\r\nfrom infantile cerebropathia.) The patient suffered from infantile\r\notitis media bilateralis, which was followed by abundant chronic\r\notorrhea from his fifteenth year. He relates that for a long time he\r\nwas obliged to wear a very large handkerchief on his shoulders to\r\nreceive the pus, which came from an ear. No sex disease. Nothing of\r\nimportance in the physical anamnesis.\r\n\r\nPatient entered the army, Jan. 15, 1915. In May, he was sent to the\r\nfront (Basso Isonzo). Towards the end of July, while he was in the\r\ntrench, a grenade exploded a short distance from him, causing slight\r\nabrasions at the nape of the neck and in the fleshy part of the left\r\ncalf. He was picked up in an unconscious state, and taken to the\r\nhospital at Cervignano, where he was admitted as a deafmute and was\r\ngiven electric treatments. After 18 days or so, first stammering and\r\nthen pronouncing with difficulty a few words, he finally regained his\r\nspeech entirely. Deafness continued, however.\r\n\r\nBeing transported to a special hospital in Florence, he was in a\r\nstate of psychic excitement for several days, showing also visual\r\nhallucinations--saw “many soldiers,” saw “many soldiers all about him.”\r\nHe was treated with chloral and bromide. The suspicions of several\r\nphysicians were aroused by the obstinate declaration by the patient\r\nthat he was incurably deaf.\r\n\r\nOn being admitted to the clinic on August 22, he showed complete\r\ndeafness in addition to a slight degree of stupor; he remained\r\nimpassive to the glance of his questioner without showing signs of\r\nworry about his condition, nor did he make any effort to make himself\r\nunderstood by making lip-movements (which is in contrast to another\r\npatient affected by organic deafness, who on the contrary made great\r\nefforts to understand anything said to him, clearly showing his great\r\ngrief over his incapacity).\r\n\r\nHe failed to respond to auditory stimuli either by air or by bone\r\nconduction. It was possible from the beginning to exclude suspicion\r\nof simulation; during the day, indeed, it was not possible by any of\r\nthe repeated attempts to awaken surprise in the patient by means of an\r\nacoustic stimulus. At night, while the patient slept, it was possible,\r\nhowever, to awaken him by calling his name, or by making a fairly loud\r\nsound; the patient would then open his eyes but was quite unable to\r\nhear. Neither confusion nor hallucinations were in evidence.\r\n\r\nHe was able to converse very well and spontaneously (he remembers\r\nhaving lost consciousness at the explosion of the grenade and not\r\ncoming to until after his arrival at the hospital at Cervignano); he\r\nread correctly both mentally and aloud, and answered by signs the\r\nquestions put to him in writing. Being face to face with hysterical\r\ntraumatic deafness, notwithstanding no other hysterical phenomena\r\nwere noticed, a successful attempt was made with suggestive therapy,\r\nthe patient being emphatically assured (always in writing) that the\r\nfollowing Sunday his hearing would be restored without doubt. The\r\nfollowing Sunday, in fact, during the visit of a lady (one of his\r\nfriends), hearing in his left ear was suddenly and almost completely\r\nrestored to the patient. He was in profound emotion on account of this,\r\nand upon the appearance of the physician he had a hard weeping spell.\r\nDuring the following day, he began slowly to hear with the right ear.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of his stay at the clinic, however (until\r\nSeptember 24, 1915), a slight hypo-acusia in the right ear persisted,\r\nalong with severe headaches and pains in the left ear (which the\r\npatient compared to the suffering as a child with otitis).\r\n\r\nAt the otoscopic examination by a specialist, only residuals of the old\r\ncatarrhal otitis with retraction of the tympanic membrane were found.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock story reproduced in hypnosis. Recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 523.= (MYERS, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private had been found wandering in a village, in shirt and socks,\r\nunable to give name, regiment, or number. He was admitted at a field\r\nambulance, and seen by Major Myers three days later. No Christian\r\nname seemed familiar to him. The past was a blank. He was depressed.\r\nThere was numbness over the occiput. The legs, hands and tongue\r\nwere tremulous. The left arm and leg and the left side of the face,\r\nchest and abdomen were hypalgesic. The knee-jerks were exaggerated;\r\npseudo-clonus of left knee and right ankle. There had been a nightmare\r\nof bombs thrown into trenches--one thrown by a German hit him in the\r\nneck and woke him up in a cold sweat.\r\n\r\nIn hypnosis the dream was repeated, and points about his previous life\r\nwere dragged out piecemeal. Next, the names of village and near-by\r\ntown, and finally his own name, regiment and number were elicited.\r\nAfter the bomb-throwing, he said, “I must have gone off my head and\r\nrun away. I must have taken off my clothes in a field. I spent the\r\nfirst night under a hedge. I spent the next two nights in a wood. I ate\r\nnothing. The next night I was walking along a road on the outskirts\r\nof a village and I was taken to a house by two men.” On waking, he\r\nproved unable to remember these things and was promptly rehypnotized,\r\nwhereupon the memories became clearer and more ample. More powerful\r\nsuggestion was given, and complete recovery of memory followed the\r\nsecond period of hypnotism. The pupils became larger. The despondency\r\ndisappeared, together with the occipital numbness and the left-sided\r\nhypalgesia. He was transferred to a base hospital, and thence after\r\nthree weeks to a hospital in England, made an uninterrupted recovery,\r\nand rejoined his regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock story reproduced in hypnosis. Recovery.\r\n\r\n=Case 524.= (MYERS, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nPrivate, 29, seen by Major Myers in a base hospital the day after\r\nentrance, was in a stupor from which he had to be repeatedly roused to\r\nanswer questions. He could recall neither name, regiment nor age, and\r\nwas unable to write or read except a few letters in very large type.\r\nTwice he said the words _war_ and _comrade_, and made a gesture as if\r\nfollowing. He agreed that a shell came and intimated that he had pains\r\nin the forehead. He could not hold his hands out for many seconds\r\nwithout dropping them. Knee-jerks brisk.\r\n\r\nFour days later he was very little better, never having spoken\r\nvoluntarily, but replying _yes_ to the utterance of his name, and was\r\nable with great effort to write his name. He still intimated his severe\r\nheadache. The next day the names of his two children were given. He\r\ncould not read aloud the figure 2 but held up two fingers. Next day, he\r\ngave syllable by syllable his wife’s name from her photograph.\r\n\r\nA week from admission he was hypnotized and persuaded to talk about the\r\nevents that preceded his disorder, breathing excitedly, gesturing, and\r\nevidently visualizing the scenes. He had been in the trenches, had been\r\nsent to draw water at a camp, and had been knocked down when two or\r\nthree shells burst over him. He carried out post-hypnotic suggestions.\r\n\r\nHe was hypnotized again, two days later, and now described how, after\r\nshelling, he had lain on the ground, dazed; had risen, picked up the\r\nwater bottle, returned to the trenches, and then lost all sense and\r\nreason. He recalled how his mates had told him he was silly, but had\r\nlost all intervening memories. But the full details were elicited by\r\npersuasion. Next day he complained that he still wrote with difficulty.\r\nUnder hypnosis, his speech and writing were restored to normal. He was\r\ndischarged two days later to an English hospital.\r\n\r\nHe was then passed for foreign service, being prevented from active\r\nservice in the field by occasional severe headaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurial after explosion of a “coal box”: Automatism, amnesia,\r\ndeafmutism: Recovery by hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 525.= (MYERS, September, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant, 18, with nineteen months service in the army, 11 months\r\nin France, was seen by Lt. Col. Myers at a clearing station to which\r\nhe had been transferred after three days in another clearing station,\r\nwith a note “Found in the streets of B----, asking his way to the fire\r\ntrench; could not be got to speak on admission nor since; seems deaf,\r\nbut now writes rationally.”\r\n\r\nMute and very deaf at the second C. C. S., he regained a good deal\r\nof his hearing with encouraging talk and also became able to cough\r\nand utter P, B, F and S, finally whispering name, regimental number,\r\nand the like. At the same time he could write fluently. After being\r\nburied he had lost himself until he had asked his way of a military\r\npoliceman at the crossroads in B----. There was amnesia again until he\r\nhad been 48 hours in the clearing station at B----. The throat hurt\r\nas if it were pulled down when he tried to speak, and his head ached\r\nwhen he tried to remember. There was much tremor, especially of right\r\narm. In a quiet room adjoining, the tremors increased and there was\r\nmuch agitation. Lt. Col. Myers suggested cure and encouraged the man,\r\nfinally inducing a mild hypnotic state in which he spoke aloud, at\r\nfirst hesitatingly, later fluently.\r\n\r\nThe man eventually remembered what had happened after he had extricated\r\nhimself. He had run, as he thought, towards the fire trench, taken\r\na wrong direction, and met a Frenchman who gave him eggs and bread,\r\nallowed him to sleep on a couch, put him on a cart and drove him to\r\nB----. He was then very giddy and asked his way of the policeman. The\r\nshell by which he was “terribly shaken” was a “coal box.” Posthypnotic\r\nsuggestion that the headache would not recur and that he would shake\r\nhands with the orderly was successful. He now talked in a proper voice,\r\nat first hesitatingly. He looked another man as his clay-colored face\r\nresumed a normal aspect. After a good night’s sleep he was evacuated\r\nto a base hospital, thence to an English hospital, whence he wrote six\r\ndays later in gratitude for the successful treatment, stating that he\r\nwas now nearly well and hoped to be fit for light duty.\r\n\r\nSix weeks later he wrote that he was still dizzy. He also remembered\r\ncertain further details of his experience; how he had wandered into a\r\nlistening sap in front of the Huns’ barbed wire and had had a tussle\r\nwith three Huns, after which he was buried during the heavy shelling.\r\n\r\n    This case belongs in the group termed by Myers “A Group,”\r\n    namely, the physical group, in which the patient has been\r\n    lifted, buried or knocked over by a shell or otherwise felt\r\n    physical or chemical effects of an explosion (in contrast with\r\n    the B Group, or psychical group, in which fear of the noise\r\n    or emotional response to the mutilation of companions is the\r\n    exciting cause). Predisposing affections occur as often in the\r\n    physical group as in the psychical group. The average age of\r\n    mutism cases seen by Lt. Col. Myers is twenty-five. Mutism is\r\n    rare among commissioned officers. Lt. Col. Myers has heard of\r\n    but one or two cases.\r\n\r\n    With respect to the technique of getting these men to utter\r\n    sounds, Lt. Col. Myers states that he first assures the patient\r\n    that he has already cured many cases of loss of speech by the\r\n    method about to be employed. The patient is next asked to copy\r\n    his teacher as the sounds (not the vowels) B, D, finally V, S\r\n    and K are made. The patient is, as a rule, shortly induced to\r\n    make the necessary movements of lips, tongue or throat. “You\r\n    see you are beginning to talk. Now let me hear you cough.” The\r\n    patient coughs. “You see you are able to make a noise. I want\r\n    you next to cough out an A (Continental pronunciation).” After\r\n    a time the patient adds this vowel to the cough. Other vowels\r\n    are now taught him. Eventually a consonant is prefixed to the\r\n    vowel instead of the cough. The patient is now delighted with\r\n    his progress and can shortly repeat surname and regimental\r\n    number.\r\n\r\n\r\nMutism: Recovery by hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 526.= (HURST, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA transport driver, 31, was run over by a loaded wagon at Gallipoli in\r\nMay, 1915, and fractured his pelvis. He remained perfectly conscious\r\nbut unable to speak for three days. At the beginning of August, when he\r\nwas admitted to the war hospital, he still spoke with great difficulty\r\nand with contortions of his face. Even when he did not speak, he had\r\nfacial contortions and that mental condition characteristic of tic,\r\nnamely: although he was able to control the contortions by will, he\r\nfelt uncomfortable during the control and finally gave way to the\r\nirresistible impulse.\r\n\r\nUnder hypnotism, it was suggested to him that he would be able to speak\r\nwithout difficulty and would no longer have the contractions of the\r\nface. When he came out of hypnosis he was able to talk quite normally,\r\nsang next evening at a concert, and a few days later he took part in a\r\nplay. The facial contortions persisted in hypnosis and even afterwards,\r\nbut vanished after a second hypnosis.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hypnosis as treatment of mutism, Ballard remarks that a genuine\r\nreturn of speech and a merely hypnotic speech must be distinguished.\r\n\r\nNonne is the great exponent of the use of hypnotism in treatment of\r\nthe war hysterias. He got as good results from high as from lower\r\nclasses of men. He remarks that the hypnosis does not protect against\r\nrecurrence if the patient again falls under the original conditions\r\nthat brought about the first attack. Hypnosis may be used also as a\r\ndiagnostic measure between functional and organic cases. Even tics and\r\ntremors have been at times cured.\r\n\r\n_Re_ employment of hypnotism, Hurst suggests that it may well be\r\nused, not only in mutism, but in hysterical deafness, blindness,\r\nand occasionally in psychasthenia. It is not a cure-all for the war\r\nhysterias, but is to be used as a not infrequent form of treatment.\r\nNonne claims cures of 51 out of 63 cases of hysteria major (28 rapidly,\r\n23 more gradually). Ten of his 63 proved refractory to hypnosis\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nStammering: Cured by hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 527.= (HURST, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn Australian, 22, wrote the following, August 21, 1916:\r\n\r\n    “You may be a little surprised to hear that I am in the Hos.\r\n    suffering from shell-shock, which has taken away my speech and\r\n    hearing. It is some sixteen days now since it happened.… We\r\n    were in the trenches and going for dear life, when two of us\r\n    spotted a German machine gunner in a hole, so we made up our\r\n    minds to have him. We made a charge at him, and I just remember\r\n    getting to him when a high-explosive shell burst at my head; it\r\n    seemed as if it burst inside my head; everything went black.\r\n    I tried to call out and couldn’t, and I could not hear my\r\n    mates--only just a terrible bursting in my head all the time. I\r\n    never remembered anything more until I came to on the boat. The\r\n    Drs. have told me that I will get alright in time. I saw a good\r\n    deal of France.… There is not a young man there who is not in\r\n    the Army. The girls and women work in the fie----”\r\n\r\nThe abrupt ending of the letter was due to the entrance of Major Hurst.\r\nThe patient had been hypnotized but his deafness had persisted during\r\nthe hypnotic sleep, so that suggestions could not be effectively taken.\r\nHe heard nothing whatever during a very heavy thunderstorm, was unable\r\nto make any sign whatever, and could not even cough.\r\n\r\nHe was now told in writing that his speech and hearing would be\r\nrestored when ether was given. After a few whiffs, he struggled and\r\nbefore he was under began to repeat the word “Mother.” Etherization was\r\ndiscontinued before his limbs had even become relaxed. As he was coming\r\nto, he was requested to repeat various words, and when the anesthetic\r\nhad passed, he was talking normally and had completely recovered\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nNow, however, his memory had become a complete blank. From a short time\r\nbefore his shell-shock up to the moment of his regaining consciousness\r\nafter etherization, he remembered nothing of his loss of speech or\r\nhearing, nothing about the events in his letter, and nothing about\r\nMajor Hurst, whom he felt he had not previously seen. According to\r\nHurst, this patient had become (_a_) speechless from fright at the time\r\nof the shell explosion, (_b_) deaf from the noise of the explosion,\r\nand (_c_) unconscious from the windage. After he came to at the time\r\nof the explosion, an autosuggestion to the effect that he had lost his\r\npower of speech and hearing occurred. Ether broke down this inhibition\r\nof speech and hearing by interfering with the control of the high over\r\nlower cerebral centers.\r\n\r\n_Re_ emotional stammering, Chavigny treats by voice gymnastics,\r\nrhythmical breathing movements, sounds spoken by metronome with\r\nsimultaneous movements of arms or trunk, and by singing. _Re_\r\nhysterical stuttering, Roussy and Lhermitte remark that the symptoms\r\nare always very pronounced, come on suddenly, and cease just as\r\nsuddenly under the influence of electrical treatment. The history will\r\ndifferentiate hysterical stuttering. The effects of treatment will also\r\nhelp. Genuine non-hysterical stammering may, of course, be increased\r\nthrough emotion or shock. Dundas Grant aids the stutterer by having him\r\ntwist a button or carry out some other muscular movement simultaneously\r\nwith the attempt to speak. He also has the patient endeavor to expand\r\nthe lower part of his chest during the effort.\r\n\r\nMacMahon notes that Shell-shock stammering is chiefly a difficulty with\r\nvowel sounds and voiced consonants, and amounts to a speech inhibition,\r\naccompanied sometimes by amnesia for words and suggesting a form of\r\naphasia. Mild cases of such stammering are cured simultaneously.\r\nMacMahon relies in part upon especially regulated breathing movements\r\nand the attendant sense of repose. The cases of old cured stammering\r\nthat have come back under Shell-shock are harder to treat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo burials; shell-shock: Mutism and amnesia. Recovery aided by\r\nhypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 528.= (MYERS, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nMajor C. S. Myers recites hypnotic cure in a case of mutism. He remarks\r\nthat malingering is sometimes suspected in these cases. There was,\r\nhowever, in this case a severe constipation which lasted five days from\r\nthe shock, and a retention of urine with catheterization during the\r\nsame period. This private, 32 years, came to a base hospital, mute but\r\nable to read and write as follows:\r\n\r\n    “I was buried alive on ---- and again on ---- [5 months and\r\n    4½ months respectively before admission], and then I had the\r\n    misfortune to have two shells burst over me on ---- [four days\r\n    before admission]. There was shelling for about 20 minutes and\r\n    then two bursted over my head. I did not remember any more\r\n    until you came to see me, but I am still living in hopes to\r\n    regain my speech back.”\r\n\r\nIt seems that he had wandered off with a lance-corporal for three days\r\nafter the first burial, and neither he nor his comrade were able to\r\nfind their regiment.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding was slow and look vacant. There were jerky movements of\r\nthe arms and a snoring sound from the nasopharynx. Voluntary movements\r\nwere restricted, weak, slowly executed, jerky, and incoördinated, but\r\nnot tremulous. Station was unsteady; failure in finger-to-nose test. He\r\ncould imitate the sound _ah_, and the consonants _s_ and _p_.\r\n\r\nKnee-jerks exaggerated; plantars flexor; abdominal reflexes absent;\r\npupils reacted; eye movements normal; moderate restriction of visual\r\nfields on temporal side; watch not heard even in contact with ear;\r\nheard better by air than by bone conduction.\r\n\r\nIn the next two days, the patient became brighter and movements became\r\nbetter. On the seventh day stupor and ataxia had disappeared. Familiar\r\nnames could be repeated and the next day could be given on request.\r\nThe patient would sweat profusely in giving replies. There was no\r\nspontaneous speech. A week later speech had improved.\r\n\r\nUnder hypnosis he spoke more fluently though feebly, and became\r\nemotional upon being questioned as to trench life, waking up suddenly\r\nfrom hypnosis and wiping the sweat from his chest.\r\n\r\nThe next day, forgotten events of the second burial were recalled\r\ntogether with what followed. Post-hypnotic suggestion of the\r\nperformance of eccentric actions was successful.\r\n\r\nNext day his memory had returned save in reference to the two days’\r\nwandering after the first burial; and under hypnosis the events of\r\nthose two days were recalled. He was then transferred to an English\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hypnosis for “war shock,” Eder remarks that the usual objections\r\nto hypnosis cannot apply because the majority of cases have no\r\nneuropathic antecedents. Eder, as psychoanalyst, endeavors to level\r\nhypnotic suggestion against the so-called “complexes.” Elliot Smith\r\nand Pear commend Lt.-Col. Myers’ results, but regard the results of\r\nhypnotic treatment as brilliant but erratic. Colin Russel, regarding\r\nhypnotism as an induced hysteria, remarks that a true hysteria can\r\nhardly be cured by adding more, although he has sometimes used the\r\ntreatment with apparent success. Podiapolsky notes that some 17\r\nper cent of his functional cases will, at a word, drop off into an\r\nartificial deep slumber. He thinks chloroform should not be given\r\nto these subjects without an attempt to secure this artificial deep\r\nslumber first. Chavigny, highly commending suggestion, notes that the\r\nuse of hypnotism is prohibited in military hospitals in France. A\r\nremark of Smirnow indicates that the Russian authorities also look with\r\ndisfavor upon hypnosis, but he notes certain patients whom he cured\r\nby hypnosis, so that apparently Russia did not absolutely forbid the\r\nuse of hypnosis in war cases. Another Russian, Arinstein, prefers the\r\nDubois method to hypnosis.\r\n\r\nRoussy and Lhermitte definitely state that the psychotherapy of\r\nDejerine, Dubois, and Babinski beneficially replaces hypnotic\r\nsuggestion, “which ought definitely to be rejected.” However, if the\r\nconclusions of Bernheim are sound, there can be no theoretical claim of\r\ndistinction between hypnosis and other forms of suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFifteen bayonet wounds; recommendation for Victoria Cross: Hysterical\r\ncontracture of hand, revealed by hypnosis as the bayonet clutch.\r\n\r\n=Case 529.= (EDER, August, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA left-handed Irishman, 23, on December 22, 1915, got 15 bayonet\r\nwounds, 14 of which were on the right side of the body. He was in the\r\ntrenches with 23 men, when they were attacked by about 200 Turks. He\r\nand a sergeant leaped out of the trench into a bayonet attack with\r\nTurks.\r\n\r\nHe was admitted to the hospital January 26, 1916, for a hysterical\r\ncontracture of the right hand. The fingers were semi-flexed and could\r\nnot be passively extended. Col. Purves Stewart noted that there was an\r\nanesthesia and analgesia to pin-pricks and cotton wool on the whole of\r\nthe right arm. “At the beginning of the examination, the patient felt\r\npin-pricks at the wrist; as examination continued, the boundary of\r\nanesthesia steadily increased until it reached the shoulder, by which\r\ntime the previously sensitive spots were now anesthetic.” Later there\r\nwas a complete right hemianesthesia.\r\n\r\nIn telling his story, this soldier repeatedly emphasized that “You must\r\nclutch your rifle very firmly and never let it up, guarding yourself\r\nall the time.” This was the explanation of the contracture. According\r\nto Eder, in the unconscious, he was still clutching the rifle, fighting\r\nthe good fight, and symbolizing the desire by the grasping hand. In\r\nhypnosis, suggestion was made that the fight was over and the rifle\r\ncould be let go, whereupon the hand was immediately relaxed.\r\n\r\nThe analgesia, thinks Eder, was present during the fight and passed\r\naway subsequently. In fact, the soldier said that he felt no pain\r\nduring the fight and did not know that he was wounded until his\r\nattention was called to the fact that blood was flowing from him.\r\nAccording to Eder, the unconscious mind refused to feel pain. At Col.\r\nStewart’s first prick or two “the unconscious took no notice, but as\r\nthe pricks continued, the former memory was revived and the unconscious\r\nbecame on guard.” He had been recommended for the V. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nGunshot of forearm: Hysterical contracture, wrist and fingers: Cure by\r\nhypnosis, “indecently quick.”\r\n\r\n=Case 530.= (NONNE, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn infantryman, without special hereditary taint and previously well,\r\nwas shot September, 1914, in the right forearm. A paralysis of the\r\nhand and fingers persisted after the wound had healed. Several reserve\r\nhospitals failed to cure the paralysis.\r\n\r\nEight months after the injury he arrived at Nonne’s clinic at\r\nEppendorf, with a flexor contracture of the right wrist joint as well\r\nas of the fingers (exclusive of thumb). The finger tips were deeply\r\nsunk in the flesh of the palm. Extension could only be brought about\r\nagainst strong resistance. There was a total anesthesia for all\r\nsensations in the hand and fingers. No contraction of visual fields.\r\n\r\nThe patient, upon suggestion, fell immediately into hypnosis. At\r\nfirst the contracture was released with some difficulty; then, with\r\ngreater ease, and then without any resistance whatever. During the same\r\nhypnotic séance the patient finally became able to extend actively\r\nboth fingers and wrist; and next day, after the patient had convinced\r\nhimself of his cure, he was able voluntarily to stretch the hand and\r\nfingers with normal amplitude and power. The disturbance of sensibility\r\nhad spontaneously disappeared.\r\n\r\nThis cure was, from the patient’s point of view, indecently quick.\r\nHe said everybody must feel he was a malingerer, and in fact he felt\r\nso himself. He went back into service, where he had been for several\r\nmonths at the date of Nonne’s report.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Nonne’s enthusiasm for hypnosis, see under Case 526. Nonne,\r\ncontrary to Babinski and Froment, would regard even the severe and\r\nobstinate vasomotor disturbances as purely functional and as not\r\neven “sub-organic.” The basis of this belief is that hypnosis cures\r\nthese phenomena as well as various tics and pertinacious tremors.\r\nFrench observers consider that these tics and tremors may even be\r\norganic in their nature, basing their ideas upon the non-success of\r\nsuggestion. (It may be noted [see under Case 528] that the French\r\nmilitary authorities do not allow the use of hypnotism in the army.)\r\nWith respect to the present case (530), of course, the French observers\r\nwould not deny the power of hypnotism to produce the cure. Babinski and\r\nFroment’s Postscript to the English edition of their work on hysteria,\r\nremarks that, though Roussy and Lhermitte state that vasomotor symptoms\r\nmay disappear along with the psychotherapeutic cure of paralyses and\r\ncontractures, yet Roussy and Boisseau later admitted that improvement\r\nin thermal and vasomotor control is at best an exceedingly slow one.\r\n\r\nMore recent personal communications indicate that there is still room\r\nfor some question as to the curability by suggestion of such disorders\r\nas tic, tremor, vasomotor imbalance, and the like. In short, the true\r\nscope of the “pithiatic” or suggestion-curable diseases is still\r\nsomewhat a matter of controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: “Doll’s head” anesthesia, mutism: Hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 531.= (NONNE, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nAn officer, mute for five months following shell-shock, had been for\r\nfour months treated in a succession of hospitals--field hospital, war\r\nhospital, two reserve hospitals.\r\n\r\nHe had no acquired or hereditary neuropathic taint, but even in the\r\nperiod before the critical shock he had been under tremendous physical\r\nand mental strain. The explosion produced a total anesthesia of the\r\nskin of the head, face, neck and shoulder region--in short, what\r\nCharcot called the “doll’s head” form of sensory disorder. Moreover,\r\nthere was a marked contraction of the visual fields.\r\n\r\nThe patient, when treatment was given, fell at once into a deep\r\nhypnosis and began to intone, and then to speak isolated words, and\r\nfinally to speak complete sentences. All that was left of his mutism\r\nwas a slight over-fatiguability of the speech organs. This also cleared\r\nup in the next few days. He was discharged well, and had already\r\nbeen--December, 1915--some months in the field.\r\n\r\nCase 531, though an officer, responded to hypnosis well, and Nonne\r\nremarks that hypnotizability is independent of the presence of\r\nany neuropathic tendencies, or of any loss of resistance through\r\nexhaustion. One trouble with the hypnotic method, according to Nonne,\r\nis the fatigue of the hypnotizer and his inability to rely upon\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Charcot, Nonne remarks that the work of Charcot on hysteria is not\r\nsufficiently well-known, especially as civilian practitioners in peace\r\ntimes had few cases. _Re_ taint, Nonne found such tendencies absent\r\nin more than half of his cases with careful anamneses. The absence of\r\nadequate psychogenic cause is a not uncommon experience according to\r\nNonne. Nonne, finding 26 cases of pure neurosis amongst 1800 cases of\r\nwar injury, had a considerable number of odd erroneous diagnoses in the\r\ngroup. Not only were cerebrospinal paralyses wrongly diagnosticated,\r\nbut ischemic paralysis, plexus paralysis, arthritis deformans and\r\nsynovitis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA soldier is put in the Landsturm at 22 and later called “unfit” by\r\nreason of tremors after mine-explosion (history of tremors at 14 after\r\na fall), but is cured by hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 532.= (GRÜNBAUM, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA _Landsturm_ soldier, 22 (father excitable, family otherwise normal),\r\nhad a history of being the best scholar in the class and well up to his\r\nfourteenth year. At 16 he fell from a tree and though he apparently\r\nsustained no injury his head and arm began to tremble. He became unable\r\nto learn and gave up his preparations to be a teacher. The tremor,\r\nhowever, disappeared in six months and he went into some technical\r\nwork. At 16½ years he went as cabin-boy, but in a fortnight he was\r\nsent home by the physician. He then began to breed carrier pigeons\r\nand got first prizes at international exhibitions. He also went into\r\nfoundry work and did well as an apprentice. He worked well at home and\r\nbusied himself with setting up small electrical and other machines.\r\nHe had never been interested in women and loved his pigeons best, and\r\ntherefore was regarded by people who knew him as not quite right. He\r\nwas also non-alcoholic.\r\n\r\nAfter mobilization he was sent back twice but finally was put into a\r\n_Jäger_ Battalion. After reaching the front he had to have a hernia\r\noperation and on getting well went back to his place and a few days\r\nlater a mine exploded near him. He was much frightened and fell down\r\nunconscious. On regaining consciousness he felt a “running” in the legs\r\nand tremors in the hands. The latter grew stronger and began to affect\r\nthe arms.\r\n\r\nAfter two months in hospital he went to garrison unrecovered, was\r\nplaced in the _Landsturm_ and did four months station duty in Russia.\r\nThe tremors persisted and when his comrades played a bad practical joke\r\non him the tremors got so bad that he was sent back home as unfit for\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nHe was a stocky looking, well-nourished man of middle height, without\r\nvisceral disease or sign of organic nervous disorder. The shaking\r\ntremor grew much more powerful in any state of excitement but always\r\npaused sufficiently to permit the execution of any particular movement.\r\nThe head movements were continuous, slight rotations. There were a few\r\nregions of anesthesia to touch, but these areas differed at different\r\nexaminations. There was a general hyperesthesia. Conjunctival, corneal\r\nand pharyngeal reflexes were absent. The man was slightly excitable,\r\napprehensive, depressed, complained of sleeping badly, did not want to\r\nsit or stand and felt as if he wanted to run away, no matter where.\r\nIn dropping off to sleep he would fall out of bed and talked aloud in\r\nhis sleep. He thought he was incurably sick. Intelligence and school\r\nknowledge were very good.\r\n\r\nHe was hypnotized eight times for periods of about five minutes each.\r\nHypnosis was extremely easy to accomplish. At the second trial the\r\nmanual tremor disappeared. After the third trial there was an essential\r\nimprovement in the shaking tremor. Moreover, his emotional state had\r\nbecome happier. He began to sleep well. He was now free from disease\r\nand regained confidence and looked upon himself as well and fit for\r\nwork. Undoubtedly without hypnotism this man would have been released\r\nfrom service after a few months of inconsequential hospital care\r\nwithout pension.\r\n\r\n_Re_ tremors, see remarks under Case 308, concerning the possibly\r\norganic nature of many of the so-called Shell-shock tremors; an opinion\r\napparently shared in by Meige and by Guillain. Babinski also found that\r\nthese tremors were not influencible by psychotherapy. Yet here is an\r\ninstance in which tremors are reported cured by hypnosis, and moreover,\r\ntremors that were recurrent from an ante-bellum attack at 14. See\r\nremarks under Case 530.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock, slight injury, unconsciousness: Astasia-abasia: Recovery\r\nunder hypnosis, two séances.\r\n\r\n=Case 533.= (NONNE, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA musketeer, without neuropathic taint and without nervous symptoms\r\nbefore the war (parents both dead of tuberculosis, eleven brothers and\r\nsisters died young), saw four comrades killed by a shell October 27,\r\n1914. The musketeer himself was slightly injured superficially in the\r\nback. He remained unconscious for three hours and on coming out showed\r\ngeneral tremor of the body, felt pressure in the head, was lachrymose\r\nand unable to walk or stand. He was subject to insomnia. He was in four\r\ndifferent hospitals, finally reaching Eppendorf. Diagnosis rendered at\r\nthe first hospital and carried on through the others was hemorrhage\r\ninto the spinal canal.\r\n\r\nFor two months at Eppendorf he lay in extension. He was then examined\r\nby Nonne, who found general neuropathic habitus, pronounced “cramp\r\nneurosis” in the lower extremities, psychogenic astasia-abasia,\r\nhyperidrosis of the lower extremities, marked cyanosis of feet and\r\nlower legs, increased tendon and skin reflexes, pseudoclonus, no\r\nBabinski or Oppenheim reflexes. The man complained of pressure in the\r\nhead, sleeplessness, a feeling of depression and hopelessness. Pulse\r\n120-130.\r\n\r\nHypnosis proved easy. After the first treatment the man stood and\r\nwalked and showed no tremor. The next day the hypnosis was repeated and\r\nthe cyanosis of the legs disappeared. Sleep on the second night was\r\ngood. Appetite returned and the man fell into a good emotional state.\r\nThereafter the patient was intentionally ignored by the physicians\r\nand could soon not be distinguished in any respect from the other\r\nnon-nervous convalescents.\r\n\r\nThis case is expressly stated by Nonne to resemble in all respects\r\nthose formerly described by Oppenheim as “traumatic neurosis.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCrural monoplegia: Cured by hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 534.= (HURST, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA Belgian soldier fell into mud on the collapse of a roof from which he\r\nwas observing the enemy. It was an hour before he got his left leg out\r\nof the mud, and found it fixed in extension. He was sent to England,\r\nwhere for three months the leg remained stiff. The spastic paralysis\r\ndid not seem organic as the leg was dragged behind. The knee and ankle\r\ncould be bent only by using much force. The entire leg was in all ways\r\nanesthetic. Babinski sign gave additional proof that the condition was\r\nhysterical: when the patient lay with arms folded and legs apart and\r\nthen tried to sit up, the normal leg was lifted and the paralyzed leg\r\nremained flat.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hurst, the paralysis and stiffness were due to an\r\nautosuggestion from the legs being embedded in mud. The anesthesia\r\nwas probably a matter of medical suggestion produced in the course of\r\nexamination during the three months of disability. According to Hurst,\r\nBabinski is right in supposing that hysterical anesthesia is almost\r\ninvariably produced by the observer.\r\n\r\nAccordingly a strong faradic current was passed through the leg, and\r\nhe was assured that sensation and power would be restored. However, he\r\ncould still walk only with difficulty.\r\n\r\nHypnosis was therefore resorted to and repeated on several occasions.\r\nHe went back to duty in three weeks, although he still held the leg\r\nsomewhat stiff when he walked.\r\n\r\n_Re_ recurrences after hypnotism, see remarks of Nonne under Case 530.\r\nHowland also notes that cases treated by hypnotism must be followed up\r\nto prevent relapse. In the above case of Hurst’s, it will be noted that\r\nthe hypnotic treatment was several times repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock, emotional (slight trauma): Tremors and sensory impairment:\r\nCure by hypnosis, thrice repeated.\r\n\r\n=Case 535.= (NONNE, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA reservist, always well, not neuropathic (mother had had seizures,\r\npossibly epileptic, for many years) was wounded in the left calf by a\r\nshell fragment, about the middle of December, 1914. He was at the same\r\ntime, as a result of the shell explosions near by, afflicted with a\r\ntremor of the whole body; this tremor gradually increased and proved\r\nrefractory to all treatment for nine months.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of September, 1915, the patient reached Nonne’s wards,\r\nshowing tremor of head, arms and legs, with pronounced hypalgesia of\r\nthe whole body, abolition of frontal and conjunctival reflexes, and\r\ncontraction of the visual fields.\r\n\r\nThe tremor of the head was completely removed at the first hypnotic\r\ntreatment. There was a slight recurrence of this tremor two days later,\r\nand traces of it could be observed for nine days. A third hypnotic\r\ntreatment swept away this tremor, which did not return.\r\n\r\nThe patient was discharged after about four weeks, suitable for\r\ngarrison duty.\r\n\r\n_Re_ traumatic neurosis, Nonne dislikes this term of Oppenheim, because\r\nsuch a term rather tends to connote unfavorable prognosis. As quoted\r\nunder Case 530, Nonne holds that the war data show that hysteria is\r\nneither a form of degeneration nor an affair built on the Freudian\r\nschema.\r\n\r\nNonne in fact maintains that the hysterical syndrome may occasionally\r\noccur with much greater ease in a normal person than ever has been\r\nknown before. It is precisely in these cases of normals getting\r\nhysterical that Nonne gets especially good results with hypnosis. If\r\nthe development of the hysterical syndrome had extended over days or\r\nweeks, then the hypnotic cure was a slower one. The above reservist\r\ndeveloped his Shell-shock gradually and required three hypnotic\r\ntreatments. But although the number of doses of hypnotism required may\r\nbe said roughly to depend upon the time which the condition took to\r\ncome to a head, yet there is no similar rule _re_ duration. A miracle\r\ncure may be brought about even in cases that have lasted over a year.\r\nThis result, if confirmed, would signify that the hysterical condition\r\nonce fixated did not especially increase in its tenacity.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hypnosis in Germany, it should be noted that Nonne is the chief\r\nprotagonist for hypnosis, at least among the well-known neurologists.\r\nPsychoelectric cures, which the Germans term Kaufmann’s cure, are also\r\ngreatly in vogue in German clinics. Despite the well-based claims of\r\nLt.-Col. Myers and of Eder, some English observers appear to condemn\r\nhypnosis as inadequate, or even as dangerous.\r\n\r\nA series of relatively successful cases like those here mentioned\r\nmight yield a wrong impression of the value of hypnosis (see Feiling’s\r\nunsuccessful case 369).\r\n\r\n\r\nHysterical paraplegia of gradual development: recovery only under\r\nrepeated hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 536.= (NONNE, December, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA volunteer, of nervous parents, had for four years suffered from\r\nattacks of uncertain (hysterical or epileptic) nature. These attacks\r\ncame on again after strenuous marching in the campaign in Belgium and\r\nFrance. Released from service at the front and detailed for guide\r\nduty, he proved unsuitable for this work, too, and was sent back to a\r\nhospital at home. Here there gradually developed a paralysis of the\r\nlower extremities. Treatment proved ineffective.\r\n\r\nAt the end of January, 1915, he came to Nonne’s wards at Eppendorf with\r\na paralysis that had lasted six months. There was a total paraplegia\r\ninferior, with anesthesia for all sensation from the knees downward.\r\nThe lower legs and feet were cyanotic and cold. The tendon and skin\r\nreflexes were lively. There was a moderate contraction of the visual\r\nfields on both sides.\r\n\r\nUnder hypnosis, the patient proved able to move both joints somewhat,\r\nbut very weakly and slowly. The patient was hypnotized daily for a\r\nweek, and made slow progress. Only after another week did it prove\r\npossible to get him to stand. After four weeks, his gait had so\r\nimproved as to look like that of a tired old man. Three weeks more of\r\ntreatment permitted the patient to walk, run and hop normally. Repeated\r\n_waking_ suggestion had failed to accomplish anything in this case. The\r\nimprovement followed only hypnosis. It seems to be a general principle\r\nthat in cases of gradual development, the recovery by hypnosis will\r\nalso be gradual.\r\n\r\n_Re_ repeated hypnosis for cases of gradual development, see remarks\r\nunder the preceding case (535).\r\n\r\n\r\nStruck by rifle butt: blindness of an eye already poor. Shell-shock:\r\ndysbasia. Hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 537.= (ORMOND, May, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant, 20 years, managed to get into the army despite the fact\r\nthat he had never been able to use his left eye, owing to hypermetropia\r\nand amblyopia. He was hit on the left side of the head by a rifle butt,\r\nand knocked unconscious, in June. On recovering, he found he could not\r\nsee at all with his left eye, which he had never been in the habit of\r\nusing. August 10, he was wounded slightly in the left thigh. August 23,\r\nwhile still on duty, with the wound not completely healed, he was blown\r\nup by a shell. He regained consciousness on a stretcher. Feeling the\r\npain in his old wound, he thought he should be unable to walk.\r\n\r\nOn shipboard, he found that he actually could not walk. He kept his\r\nleft eye covered by a shade on account of headache that would follow\r\nexposure to light. He was much excited and had bad nightmares.\r\n\r\nAfter the journey home from the Dardanelles, it was found that the left\r\neye was normal except for the hypermetropia, despite the fact that he\r\nwas quite unable to see with the eye.\r\n\r\nHe was hypnotized four times, losing the nightmares and much of the\r\nheadache after the first treatment; the eye pain on exposure to\r\nlight, after the second treatment; and the blindness, after the third\r\ntreatment. He was now able to see with his left eye as well as before\r\nhe was struck. He was still unable to walk without crutches. Hypnotized\r\nthe fourth time, he was told he could walk, and did so.\r\n\r\nFor hypnotic treatment of blindness, see under Case 521. _Re_ blindness\r\nof eye already poor, see Cases 294-301 (296 and 297 eye cases). Ormond\r\nstates that in the treatment of Shell-shock blindness, he first tried\r\nrest, tonics, cutting off tobacco, confinement in bed, isolation,\r\npersuasion, encouragement, counter-irritation; but that all these\r\nmeasures failed. Suggestion and hypnosis succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion; concussion; retinal hemorrhage: Blindness. Cure by\r\nhypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 538.= (HURST, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nAn English private, 22, was looking over a parapet, July 18, 1915.\r\nHe afterward remembered sand thrown in his eyes and a fall backward,\r\nhitting his head, after a shell had struck the sandbags in front of\r\nhim. He was unconscious 24 hours. Upon recovery, he found himself\r\ncompletely blind, save that he could just tell light from darkness with\r\nthe left eye. His eyes were sore and eyelids blackened; there was also\r\nsevere headache and partial deafness.\r\n\r\nHearing returned and the headache improved shortly; but the condition\r\nof the eye seemed more permanent. On forcibly opening the eyes,\r\nSeptember 14, they were turned far upwards so that the iris could\r\nscarcely be seen. Some sand grains were buried in the conjunctiva, not\r\nin the cornea. There was no inflammation about the sand grains.\r\n\r\nIn hypnosis, he was told that he would see on waking. The moment he\r\nwoke, this suggestion was repeated forcibly and his eyes were held\r\nopen. He cried out that he could see; tears ran down his cheeks; he\r\nfell on his knees in gratitude. Three days later, he said he was able\r\nto see as well as he had ever seen. There was, however, an opacity\r\nof the vitreous of the left eye, the result of a retinal hemorrhage:\r\ndoubtless the result of injury at the time of the explosion. September\r\n30, he had perfect vision in the right eye and 6/36 in his left.\r\n\r\n_Re_ results of hypnotic treatment, Lt.-Col. Myers, summarizing 23\r\ncases of Shell-shock, got apparently complete cures in 26 per cent, and\r\ndistinct improvement in another 26 per cent. He failed to hypnotize 35\r\nper cent, and got no improvement after hypnosis in 13 per cent. Is the\r\nrecovery after hypnosis complete and permanent? Lt.-Col. Myers believes\r\nthat it may be, but others remark the tendency to relapse (see Case\r\n534). Similar objections may be made to the psychoelectric treatment as\r\nused by Vincent, Yealland, or Kaufmann. See under Case 535.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppendix operation: Post-operative retention of urine. Relief by\r\nhypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 539.= (PODIAPOLSKY, August, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 32, operated for appendicitis, had a post-operative\r\nretention of urine. Hypnotic suggestion was requested to reëstablish\r\nexcretion of urine before resort should be had to the catheter.\r\n\r\nSomnambulistic amnesia was obtained at once and without questioning him\r\nP. suggested to him directly that he must feel the need of micturition.\r\nThe suggestion was unsuccessful. However, bearing in mind psychogenic\r\nobstacles of an unknown nature, P. questioned the patient as to\r\nsensations and learned that in the operation the skin had been burned\r\nabout the urinary passage and that the patient feared micturition.\r\nBesides this, micturition was painful on account of the wound above the\r\nappendix. The patient also feared that the sutures would yield.\r\n\r\nAccordingly assurance was given that the burned parts would be\r\ninsensible and that the bladder could be emptied without effort and\r\nwithout endangering the sutures. Analgesia was produced by a few\r\npassages of the hand upon the bed clothes. Complying with post-hypnotic\r\nsuggestion the patient urinated after a quarter of an hour of sleep,\r\nand in thirty-six hours retention was relieved.\r\n\r\nWith respect to frequency of immediate somnambulism for the first\r\ntrial, P. states that, although authorities set the percentage of\r\nsuccessful immediate somnambulisms at 17-20 per cent, war conditions\r\nyield three or four times as high a percentage. The war has produced a\r\nsuitable soil for hypnotism. Hypnosis is impossible in from 1½ to 2 per\r\ncent of cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nWound of sciatic nerve: Pains after operation. Relief by hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 540.= (PODIAPOLSKY, August, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA German prisoner, 33, was admitted to a Russian Hospital, November\r\n11, 1916, with “a bad wound of upper right thigh, marked pains in\r\nright sciatic nerve especially affecting feet.” Morphine and pantopon\r\ndid not abolish the pain. Insomnia. November 13, the sciatic nerve\r\nwas surgically freed from a scar and laid in the midst of the femoral\r\nbiceps. Every evening pantopon was injected; but the pains and insomnia\r\npersisted nevertheless.\r\n\r\nNovember 19, he was hypnotized. The pain stopped. He had an excellent\r\nnight, and the next day felt only a slight pain in the toes.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, while giving him suggestion in the German language,\r\nP. had said fingers instead of toes (inadvertently, since the Russian\r\nlanguage uses the same term for both). He slept well to November 29 but\r\nstill felt a slight pain in the toes. On November 29 another hypnotic\r\nsitting was given, and the toes this time were named correctly. The\r\nnext day the patient said, “You have relieved me of all the rest of my\r\npain.” He had no pain thereafter and the morphine and pantopon were\r\ndispensed with. Sleep returned.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this patient had his hair grow white in a few months of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\r\nShip blown up by mine: Stereotyped explosion dream by survivor: Cure by\r\nhypnosis (also of antebellum habitual headache).\r\n\r\n=Case 541.= (RIGGALL, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA survivor of H.M.S. T.B. II, blown up by a mine off Harwich,\r\nwas admitted to the naval hospital at Chatham, March 3, 1916, a\r\nwell-nourished, nervous looking lad, aged 20. After the accident, he\r\nbegan to dream, always the same dream, of the explosion, waking up with\r\nthe cry of the ship mates, and then unable to sleep the rest of the\r\nnight. The knee and ankle-jerks were somewhat exaggerated.\r\n\r\nApril 15, when there had been no improvement, he was hypnotized. The\r\npatient was told to lie back in an arm chair, make himself comfortable\r\nand allow muscles to relax. He was told to fix his eyes and concentrate\r\nhis attention on an electric lamp. The suggestion of sleep was made,\r\nand he was repeatedly told in a monotonous voice that he was becoming\r\nmore and more sleepy. Then in an emphatic voice he was told that the\r\ntreatment would completely cure him. He had no more dreams after this\r\nfirst sitting.\r\n\r\nHypnosis was continued every other day until April 20, when he was\r\ndischarged cured. After the first sitting hypnosis was induced by\r\nsimply telling the patient to go to sleep, which he would immediately\r\ndo on entering the room, while still standing up. At subsequent\r\nsittings, he was made to write twenty times such phrases as: “I feel\r\nmuch better”; “I shall have no more bad dreams.”\r\n\r\nOnce when a tooth was to be pulled a post-hypnotic suggestion that no\r\nmore pain would be felt was given, nor was any pain felt. Headache\r\npersisted after the first two or three sittings. Accordingly, during\r\nhypnosis a pencil was pressed to the forehead with the suggestion that\r\nit would burn and that after waking there would be an itching pain for\r\nhalf an hour, followed by recovery from headache. Curiously enough, a\r\ndistinct erythema of the skin was observed over the point of pressure.\r\nToothache and headache vanished.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock from air-craft bomb: Amnesia: Recovery under hypnosis (also\r\nremoval of a headache dating from childhood).\r\n\r\n=Case 542.= (BURMISTON, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nMay 22, 1916, a stoker, 26, was found on shipboard in a workshop\r\nbehind oil drums, refusing to come out, looking dazed, not recognizing\r\nmessmates, suspicious and complaining of headache. He reached the Royal\r\nNaval Hospital at St. Malo, May 24, answering questions “Don’t know,”\r\nand physically normal except for diminished knee-jerks. At the end of\r\ntwo or three weeks he would answer questions about his stay at the\r\nhospital, but complained of headache or weight in the head. Wassermann\r\nreaction, negative.\r\n\r\nSpecial examination on May 26, showed an amnesia for everything up to\r\nhis arrival at St. Malo. For example, he did not know the name or use\r\nof a hammer or a pressure gauge, though he knew the pressure gauge was\r\nmade of brass and glass, having seen brass and glass in the hospital\r\nwards. He had no idea of the nature of a ship. He was sent to the\r\nsick bay at the Royal Naval Barracks at Chatham, July 7, carrying a\r\nrecommendation that he be retrained as a stoker.\r\n\r\nHe was put under hypnosis, induced by gazing at the brass knob of\r\na paper weight. He went off easily, was told there was nothing to\r\nworry about, taken back to the beginning of his illness, and asked\r\nwhat happened. He told about a bomb explosion from aircraft, and how\r\nhe had lost his memory after a nearby explosion. He told how he was\r\nmarried and had a child 21 months old. During the narrative about bombs\r\nfalling, his worry was such that he was put in a deeper hypnotic sleep,\r\nand was told that he would remember all that had happened. Upon being\r\nordered to wake up, he remained dazed for a few moments, and then said\r\nthat he was all right. Asked about his marriage, he replied that of\r\ncourse he was married and had a child.\r\n\r\nAfter four days leave, he returned, July 13, without trouble except a\r\nheadache, from which it appeared that he had suffered ever since a\r\nfall when a child. He was again put into a hypnotic state and asked to\r\nremember the accident that caused the headache. He was conducted back\r\nthrough the years, and finally described a white house in India, his\r\nfall in the area, the black people in white clothes, the cut bleeding\r\nhead. He was told that he would have no more of such headaches. On\r\nbeing wakened, he said that his headache was gone, and retold the story\r\nof the accident. August 2, he said he had never felt better in his\r\nlife. September 1, he was drafted to a seagoing ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock, unconsciousness: Convulsions (recollection of childhood\r\nconvulsions): Cure by hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 543.= (HURST, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA New Zealander was rendered unconscious for a few minutes following\r\nconcussion from a high explosive shell. Convulsions developed,\r\noccurring at least once and often several times a day.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of these convulsions, it appeared that the soldier\r\nhad had a few convulsions after falling on his head at the age of\r\n8. According to Hurst, recollection of these childhood convulsions\r\nprobably led by a process of autosuggestion to the Shell-shock\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nCaptain Crabtree hypnotized the man, suggesting recovery. The fits\r\nimmediately ceased and did not recur.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecurrent hysterical mutism. Spontaneous recovery in (_a_) 18 months\r\n(antebellum incident). (_b_) Hypnotic recovery in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n=Case 544.= (EDER, August, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in a mine accident eight years before the war, lost his\r\nspeech when his brother was killed, and then recovered his speech\r\nspontaneously after 18 months.\r\n\r\nAfter a shell explosion in Gallipoli, he was again struck speechless\r\nand also deaf.\r\n\r\nSix weeks later, he came to Dr. Eder and objected in writing to\r\ntreatment, saying that he believed in nature’s methods. God had taken\r\nhis voice away before and had restored it. Eder replied in writing\r\n“rather irreverently” that God had taken 18 months, but he could do it\r\nin a few minutes. The patient afterward consented to treatment, and\r\nspeech and hearing were duly restored in the time promised, whereupon\r\nDr. Eder told him that in point of fact his physician was merely the\r\ninstrument of Providence.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurasthenic symptoms: Cured by repeated hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 545.= (TOMBLESON, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private, 24, was admitted to hospital with diagnosis neurasthenia,\r\nMarch 11, 1916. He suffered from vertical headache; general analgesia,\r\nmore definite on the right side (patient left-handed); loss of smell\r\nand taste, also more definite on the right side; paresis of right leg,\r\nwith dragging of foot (old trench foot); and sleeplessness.\r\n\r\nThe next day Tombleson put him in a hypnotic state, third stage, and\r\nagain, March 13, but without results.\r\n\r\nMarch 14, the somnambulistic stage was reached in hypnosis, and next\r\nday the man’s headache was much relieved as a result of the suggestion\r\noffered. He was again hypnotized and the following day, March 16, the\r\nheadache had vanished and the man was in general much improved. In\r\nsomnambulism the disappearance of the analgesia was suggested, and it\r\nproved possible to make the man walk about without limp and without\r\ndragging the right foot. Next day the analgesia was much relieved. In\r\nsomnambulism the suggestions were repeated.\r\n\r\nMarch 18, the man said he was quite well, and proved to be so on\r\nexamination, except that he could not yet taste with absolute normality\r\non the right side. In somnambulism it was further suggested that the\r\ncure was a perfect one and included the sense of taste. However,\r\nMarch 25, the expected improvement had not yet occurred in the taste,\r\nwhereupon further suggestions were given in hypnotic somnambulism, _re_\r\ntaste. Next day taste had become normal.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hypnosis, Tombleson says that the most successful cases of\r\nhypnosis are those of Shell-shock psychasthenia, but that he gets\r\nvery good results with hyperthyroidism and with neurasthenia also. He\r\ngoes so far as to say that practically all cases of war neurasthenia\r\nand psychasthenia can be cured and sent back to work if treatment by\r\nhypnotic suggestion is used in a reasonable time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeurotic symptoms: Improvement under repeated hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 546.= (TOMBLESON, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private, 32, was admitted, April 15, 1916, to Tombleson’s ward from\r\nthe Cottonera Mental Ward with the diagnosis: psychasthenia with\r\nparesis of right arm. The man was very suspicious of the medical\r\nprofession, melancholy, morose and prone to tears. He had been kicked\r\nby a horse four years before and showed a depressed and very tender\r\nscar in the right parietal region. The right side of the body since\r\nthat injury had been getting weaker, but the arm was much weaker than\r\nthe leg. Anesthesia was practically complete on the right side. There\r\nwas a wasting of the muscles of the right arm and the skin of the hand\r\nand fingers was thin and shiny.\r\n\r\nBefore his transfer the man was placed in the somnambulistic state,\r\nwith suggestions of happiness and confidence in the coming cure. He\r\narrived at Valletta, April 16, in a cheerful frame of mind, stating\r\nthat there was nothing now the matter but weakness. Under somnambulism\r\nthe loss of symptoms was suggested and, April 17, the patient was well\r\nexcept for the loss of power in the arm and leg. Daily training under\r\nsomnambulism was given for a period of seven days, with suggestions\r\nespecially leveled at the paretic muscles. He was then so far recovered\r\nthat hypnotic treatment was stopped. The patient went to England, May\r\n12, 1916, well.\r\n\r\n\r\nConvulsions, “Jacksonian,” and dysbasia: Cure by hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 547.= (TOMBLESON, September, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA private, 18, was admitted to hospital, March 22, 1916, with the\r\ndiagnosis Jacksonian epilepsy, with marked functional gait. He had just\r\nhad several fits--two March 20, two March 21, and several earlier. He\r\nwas tremulous and could not stand. Much pain. Knee-jerks brisk.\r\n\r\nThere was a history of a fall into a harbor at seven, followed\r\nby bleeding from nose and ears and unconsciousness for a week.\r\nConvulsions, involving the face, arm and leg, and attended by\r\nunconsciousness, kept recurring until twelve. Five months before\r\nadmission there had been cerebrospinal meningitis. In February at\r\nSalonica he had had pneumonia.\r\n\r\nMarch 23-24 the soldier was hypnotized to the third stage, but he had\r\ntwo fits. A “funny feeling in the right big toe” was brought out and\r\nsuggested away. March 26-27 the patient was able to walk with a typical\r\nfunctional disorder. Under somnambulism the suggestions were repeated,\r\nbut on the evening of March 27 two more convulsions appeared. In\r\nsomnambulism he explained that he “had got round” the inhibition of the\r\naura.\r\n\r\nThe night of April 2 occurred two convulsions. April 5, the man was\r\nplaced in the somnambulistic stage to last three days. During the\r\nnight of April 6 he was observed to be restless for an hour, with some\r\ntwitching of the right face, yet no fit followed. The morning of April\r\n8 the patient woke feeling well. He was again placed in somnambulism to\r\nlast two days. Two hours later, however, a fit started. It was stopped\r\nat once by suggestion, but the patient woke. He was left awake the\r\nrest of the day. April 9, somnambulism: suggestions repeated; sleep to\r\nlast for two days. That evening there was a slight beginning of a fit,\r\nwhich was stopped at once by suggestion, the patient waking April 11 in\r\nanother beginning of a fit, stopped by suggestion.\r\n\r\nThereafter no more fits recurred at all. May 12, 1916, well.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgoraphobia: Cure by hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 548.= (HURST, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA captain was (with one lieutenant) the sole survivor among his\r\nbattalion officers at Ypres. The captain received the D. S. O. for his\r\ngallant conduct in saving the remnant of his battalion. He now felt\r\nhe could never face responsibility again and that he would disgrace\r\nhimself if he ever got into danger. He developed a terrible dread of\r\nopen places and became more and more depressed. When he heard that\r\nthere was going to be an attack at Neuve Chapelle, he broke down but\r\nmanaged to get through the first day of the battle. He was worse\r\noff than ever in the evening, felt that he could not face another\r\nday’s fighting, was invalided home, and arrived in a condition of\r\nexhaustion and feeling of disgrace. He had bad dreams at night. Rest\r\nwas insufficient to restore confidence. Hypnosis was followed by rapid\r\nimprovement, and the man was soon able to get back to duty.\r\n\r\n_Re_ agoraphobia, see Section A, XI, Psychopathoses, and also Steiner’s\r\ncase (182) of claustrophobia, in which shells were preferred to safety\r\nin a tunnel.\r\n\r\n\r\nStress on Eastern front; cardiac seizures; cellulitis: In\r\nconvalescence, manual tremors. Treatment eventually by forcing and\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\n=Case 549.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA subaltern officer, 24, in civil life a student of mathematics, had\r\nserious hereditary taint on both sides (father, alcoholic; maternal\r\ngrandfather, victim of “severe nervous disease”). As a boy he developed\r\nnormally, and was a good student. He served as volunteer in 1911 to\r\n1912, but in drill in 1913 he had had to be released from service on\r\naccount of nervous heart and difficulty with respiration.\r\n\r\nHowever, he was called to the colors at the outbreak of the war, and\r\nwas subjected to tremendous strain in the eastern campaign; and he was\r\nput in the pack train at the end of November for cardiac seizures. He\r\nhad a cellulitis with furunculosis following, and at the beginning of\r\nDecember there was suppuration of the whole right tibia. He was treated\r\nin hospital and slowly recovered.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of March, 1915, without obvious external cause, while\r\nsitting in a café, the convalescent officer felt a cramp in his right\r\nhand, and strong movements of the hand to right and left followed. He\r\nwas treated with bromides, but unsuccessfully. The tremors became more\r\nmarked and then again from time to time grew weaker. Electric treatment\r\nincreased the shaking to a maximal degree. April 27, the patient was\r\nbrought to the nerve hospital at Jena.\r\n\r\nThe patient was a fat and muscular man, of average size, with very\r\nsmall ears and poorly-developed, adherent lobules, and syndactylism\r\nof the second and third toes of both feet; reflexes increased; marked\r\ndermatographia; a static fine tremor with rapid oscillations. The\r\ntremor became a positive tonus if the arm and hand were stretched out\r\nhorizontally. Face and chest reddened easily.\r\n\r\nWhenever any other voluntary movement was carried out (even slight\r\nfinger movements of the left hand or of the right or left foot\r\nwhile lying in bed) this right-sided convulsive tremor immediately\r\ndisappeared. The movements could also be made to disappear by slight\r\nturning movements of the head or of the tongue. Moreover, when the\r\nmind was diverted, as in reading, the tremors ceased. When the patient\r\nthought intensely of some mathematical problem, he could bring his\r\nshaking to a stop. The left grip was stronger than the right. In the\r\nRomberg position there was a marked swaying to the left and backwards.\r\n\r\nSubjectively, the patient complained of nothing but a circumscribed\r\nheadache in the left parietal region and of sleep interrupted by\r\nfrightful dreams. At first the condition remained unchanged. There was\r\nmuch insomnia, and the slightest noise caused fright. Headaches in\r\nthe daytime also were produced by any noise, and these headaches were\r\nlocalized in the left parietal region. The tremors of the right hand\r\npersisted except as he caused them to stop as above mentioned. He could\r\nwrite well with his left hand. He would drum with his left hand on the\r\ntable until the tremor of his right hand disappeared. He could play on\r\nthe piano, playing first with the left hand until the right had become\r\nquiet. He was a very irritable man, passing into anger and extreme\r\nprofanity at the slightest occasion, and it was very difficult to bring\r\nhim to any kind of orderly activity or persistence in therapeutic\r\nmeasures. These consisted of baths, massage, and gymnastics, but they\r\nproved quite unavailing.\r\n\r\nAs the fellow got more and more intolerable, and as upon May 27 at\r\nabout 9 o’clock in the evening, he disturbed the quiet of the entire\r\nhospital by a severe paroxysm of scolding, he was placed in a single\r\nroom in the psychiatric department. He was placed in bed, cut off from\r\nall communication with others, and forced to carry out his exercises.\r\n\r\nFor two days he was surly, crabbed and obstinate, but then changed\r\nhis demeanor completely; he became friendly and obedient. The tremor\r\ncompletely disappeared.\r\n\r\nFive days later he was able to carry out all active gymnastic exercises\r\nwith great energy and without the slightest disturbance in the right\r\narm. At date of report he was busy in the garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive weeks’ field service: Loss of speech. Cure by verbal and electric\r\nsuggestion in three weeks.\r\n\r\n=Case 550.= (SCHOLZ, December, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA grenadier, 21, of healthy stock, physique, and habits, lost his\r\nspeech, April 15, 1916, five weeks after going into the field. May 5,\r\nexamination showed him a well-nourished healthy man (lively reflexes\r\nand slight dermatographia), able to communicate only by signs and\r\nwriting. The laryngoscope showed almost complete immobility of the two\r\nvocal cords, which lay in the cadaveric position, as in paralysis of\r\nthe recurrent nerves. In endeavoring to pronounce the vowels ā and ee\r\nthe cords trembled but failed to move toward each other. The patient’s\r\neffort to speak was such that his head soon got deep red and sweat\r\nstreamed from the forehead.\r\n\r\nSpeech exercises were started by passing the electric current through\r\nthe larynx during the processes of laryngoscopy. The patient was\r\nmeantime assured that his larynx was healthy and that he would soon\r\nlearn to speak again. At the first sitting, the patient felt himself\r\nable to cough aloud.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days, the patient was able to speak the separate vowels\r\ntolerably well, and was then made to go on with such words as Anna,\r\nOtto, Hurrah. The vocal cords began to move better. Fatigue was a\r\nfeature of the first treatments, of such a degree that words that could\r\nbe pronounced during the first part of the sitting were lost toward the\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThe grenadier assiduously set himself to say over and over again the\r\nwords that he had learned, and would come to the sister radiant with\r\njoy at his success. In ten days he was able to speak again perfectly,\r\nthough giving the impression of a slight stuttering. After three weeks\r\nhospital stay he was discharged cured and fit for service.\r\n\r\n\r\nStruck by a rifle butt on right side of head; old wound of right thigh:\r\nHysterical right hemiplegia and deafmutism. Treatment by faradization:\r\nReturn of speech and improvement of hearing. Full recovery by\r\nsuggestion. Hysterical CONVULSIONS developed BY HETEROSUGGESTION from\r\nconvulsive neighbor.\r\n\r\n=Case 551.= (ARINSTEIN, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian corporal, 21, was knocked unconscious, September 13, 1915,\r\nby a butt of a rifle which struck the right side of his head. He came\r\nto in a short time. He was examined in hospital, early in October, and\r\nbesides a small skin wound of the head, there was evidence of a wound\r\non the anterior aspect of the thigh. There was paralysis of both right\r\narm and right leg, and anesthesia of the entire right side of the body,\r\nface and even of the tongue. There were also pains over the whole\r\nright side of the body. The abdominal reflexes were present on both\r\nsides; the tendon reflexes were in excess on the hemiplegic side; there\r\nwere no pathological reflexes of any sort. The patient’s hearing was\r\ndiminished, and he could not speak at all although he could understand\r\nthe speech of others perfectly.\r\n\r\nSpeech returned after a single séance of suggestion with faradism to\r\nthe throat. Hearing began to improve. The patient’s suggestibility\r\nwas a favorable factor in his cure, but there were some unfavorable\r\nfeatures. One day, he saw a neighbor go into convulsions and proceeded\r\nto develop convulsions himself. These hysterical convulsions continued.\r\nAccording to Arinstein, such undesirable complications appear under\r\nconditions of extreme crowding of hospital patients suffering\r\nfrom shell-shock. Progressive séances of psychotherapy caused the\r\ndisappearance of all the signs of paralysis, and at the time of the\r\nreport, there was no disability, except that the full use of the hand\r\nhad not yet been regained.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock and burial; labyrinthine disease on one side: DEAFMUTISM.\r\nCures, relapses and eventual cure by general anesthesia, more than four\r\nmonths after shock.\r\n\r\n=Case 552.= (DAWSON, February, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA private, 30, had been 12 years in the service. July 8, 1915, he was\r\npartially buried by a shell which killed two companions.\r\n\r\nOn admission to hospital he spoke a few sentences but was deaf, and\r\nnext morning could neither speak nor read, nor did he take food for 36\r\nhours thereafter.\r\n\r\nAdmitted to the King George Hospital, July 18, he was found stuporous,\r\nbut started violently if touched, made signs indicating his wants, took\r\nno interest in surroundings, and resisted efforts to arouse him. He was\r\nwithout signs of organic disease. It seems that he had been a nervous\r\nchild, with nightmares and fits.\r\n\r\nJuly 24, he was given gas for dental extraction, partly in the hope\r\nthat he would recover speech; but though he struggled violently, he\r\nmade no sound. He had by this time become rather intelligent in a\r\nchildlike manner, being pleased to see his small boy, but taking no\r\nnotice of his wife. It transpired afterward that he did not recognize\r\nher.\r\n\r\nPhonation in whisper now began. There was then a relapse, and for a\r\nweek or more no food was taken. Such relapses with irritation and\r\nhypobulia and an obstinate constipation recurred; but improvement\r\ncame on slowly. He became able to read short printed words, and later\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\nFor another month there was no improvement and he lost heart and the\r\nwill to get well, brightening up only when offered a motor drive or\r\nsomething else pleasant. He was transferred to an auxiliary hospital,\r\nagainst his will, September 18.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, he was brought back to the King George Hospital, excited,\r\nshouting, struggling and evidently drunk. On a day’s leave from the\r\nconvalescent hospital he had come up to London, and in alcoholic\r\nelation began to laugh and talk. Morphia did not reduce his violence.\r\nHe insisted on seeing the physician, to tell him the good news. Hearing\r\nwas still diminished, though if attention were diverted, direct answers\r\nwere given to some questions. Sleep followed.\r\n\r\nThe next day he spoke perfectly but could hear nothing. There was no\r\nfurther progress for three weeks, though he occasionally caught sounds.\r\nHe now became bright and pleasant and had lost all irritability and\r\nsulkiness. Galvanic and faradic current had no effect on the ears.\r\n\r\nNovember 27, after elaborate preparation to heighten the suggestive\r\neffect, the patient was kept in bed and given gas and ether up to the\r\nabolition of the corneal reflex. As he was coming round, the doctor\r\nshouted that he could now hear well. He was overcome with joy and had\r\nhysterical convulsions. He could hear, but with the right ear only. In\r\npoint of fact, the left ear on examination showed signs of labyrinthine\r\ndeafness. He was placed on home service.\r\n\r\n_Re_ etherization for functional deafness and mutism, Ninian Bruce\r\nmaintains that ether is more satisfactory than chloroform. The loss\r\nof consciousness in cases of deafness and mutism ought to be a\r\nrelatively slight one, and the patient should be suddenly roused to the\r\nrealization that he is speaking. Recovery from chloroform anesthesia\r\nis, according to Ninian Bruce, too slow to allow the patient to catch\r\nthe point that he is now speaking and hearing when he was formerly dumb\r\nor deaf. A failure with the method is a bad thing for the patient, as\r\nhe loses confidence in the method, whereupon some other method must be\r\nresorted to.\r\n\r\n_Re_ etherization for deafmutism, see technic of Ninian Bruce under\r\nCase 553. Penhallow has a case in which during primary etherization the\r\npatient reviewed in a loud voice the whole story of his speech loss.\r\nHe was found to have recovered speech and hearing after coming out of\r\nether.\r\n\r\n_Re_ anesthesia by gas, Abrahams has used nitrous oxide for cure of\r\nhysterical paraplegia. Proctor also reports the use of light ether\r\nanesthesia for bringing out the voice of functional mutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock functional deafness (five months). Yes-No test. Cure by\r\nsuggestion on emerging from ether anesthesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 553.= (BRUCE, May, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Edinburgh,\r\ncompletely deaf in the left ear. He had been under shell fire a number\r\nof times in France and was eventually thrown down and made unconscious\r\nby a shell explosion on his left. He did not remember the noise of the\r\nexplosion or anything until he found himself in hospital. After the\r\nexplosion he had begun to stutter, and the stuttering had grown worse.\r\nExamination of the ear indicated that the deafness was functional. He\r\nwas given ether and when just under was asked if he could hear anything\r\nspoken in his right ear. He said, “Yes.” With the right ear closed he\r\nwas asked if he could hear when his left ear was spoken into. He said,\r\n“No.” This test was repeated several times. After covering his right\r\near, he gave his name, regiment, etc., in reply to questions whispered\r\ninto his left (previously deaf) ear. The incongruity was pointed out.\r\nHe was now suddenly wakened. He laughed hysterically with joy over his\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nBut the next morning he was again stone deaf in the left ear.\r\nBlistering and electricity failed to produce benefit. He was, however,\r\npuzzled about himself.\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight he was again given ether and a little chloroform was\r\nadded. The yes-no test was again positive. He was allowed to recover\r\ngradually from the chloroform, but he had now lost recollection of what\r\nhad happened. The left ear remained deaf. Ether was again given. He was\r\nasked to close his right ear with his finger. While answering questions\r\naddressed to his left ear, he was suddenly awakened and immediately\r\nsaid that his hearing had come back. This return proved permanent. He\r\nreturned to his dépôt. In the conversations under ether there was no\r\nstuttering. He had been totally deaf in the left ear for five months.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlow in neck by rifle butt: aphasia, right hemiplegia and\r\nhemianesthesia, and especially (here MEDICAL suggestion) trismus:\r\nRecovery by anesthetic and suggestion.\r\n\r\n=Case 554.= (ARINSTEIN, September, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian soldier was struck in the head and neck by a rifle butt, and\r\ndeveloped paralysis of right arm and leg with loss of speech. After the\r\nexcitement experienced by the patient when exhibited to the students\r\nby the late Prof. M. N. Szukowsky in the neurological clinic of the\r\nMilitary Medical Academy, trismus developed.\r\n\r\nThe patient spent a year in various hospitals, the most diverse methods\r\nof treatment by drug therapy, electricity, and suggestion yielding no\r\nresults. The patient had to be fed chiefly by nose and rectum, though\r\nsmall quantities of fluids were fed through the mouth through an\r\nopening formed by the falling out of one tooth in the upper jaw. The\r\npatient became greatly emaciated and weak and was, October 29, 1915,\r\nbrought into the nervous wards of the hospital.\r\n\r\nHe showed flaccid paralysis of left arm and leg, together with\r\nanesthesia, analgesia and thermanesthesia over the whole left side of\r\nthe head, extreme general atrophy of muscles, somewhat more marked on\r\nthe palsied side. The temperature of the paralyzed half of the body\r\nwas not lowered. No knee or Achilles reflex obtained upon either the\r\naffected or the healthy side (general exhaustion?). Abdominal and\r\ntesticular reflexes lively. The pupils responded well to light. Corneal\r\nreflexes lively. The neck was held awry to the left, and the head\r\nwas inclined somewhat downwards and leftwards; hearing on left side\r\nimpaired. The jaws could not be opened even with the greatest effort.\r\nWassermann reaction negative.\r\n\r\nPatient thought himself incurable. Purves Stewart’s case, in which\r\nchloroform and oxide of nitrogen were used, was the basis of\r\nArinstein’s treatment. It was suggested to the patient that he submit\r\nto narcosis with the proviso that he would not be operated upon. His\r\nconsent was secured; with the coöperation of others, the chloroform\r\nwas administered November 6. The stage of excitability was not well\r\nmarked. 8 gr. of chloroform was used altogether, by the drop system.\r\nNevertheless, even with the weak initial excitability, the patient\r\nbecame capable of some movements with paralyzed hand and foot. On\r\nopening mouth, the patient yawned yet uttered no sound. Between the\r\njaws was put a rubber insertion and upon awakening the patient was\r\nlet see with his own eyes that his jaws were open and that therefore\r\nfood might be introduced through the mouth. Upon repetition of the\r\nnarcosis, 5 gr. of chloroform was used altogether, and the stage of\r\nexcitability was this time better marked. To strengthen movements in\r\nthe paralyzed extremities, the device of pricking the patient with a\r\npin on the unaffected half of the body, with the unaffected hand and\r\nleg held horizontal by assistants, was adopted. The patient then made\r\nreflex defensive movements in the paralyzed extremities, especially the\r\nhand. At this point the narcosis was suspended, and the irritation with\r\nthe pin was continued until consciousness returned. At this moment, the\r\npatient’s attention was called to the disappearance of the paralysis\r\nand his restored ability to move the paralyzed extremities.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on, the patient’s condition underwent a sharp\r\ntransition. Artificial feeding became unnecessary. The patient ate by\r\nmouth; the mouth was opened by the leverage of a small stick held by\r\nthe patient between his teeth. Speech returned gradually. In reading\r\naloud the patient aided the movements of his lips with his hands. At\r\nthe time of report the patient spoke well, ate normally, had gained in\r\nweight, and with some effort could sit down and even stand and walk.\r\nAll this was attained in a relatively short time after a whole year of\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\nThe author felt that the success attained in this case gave him the\r\nright to use the same method where the cause was not a contusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen months’ field service; severe FEBRILE DISEASE: Afterward hysterical\r\nTRIPLEGIA, MUTISM, “JUMPING-JACK” reactions to stimulation of feet.\r\nCure by anesthesia, verbal suggestion, faradism to palate.\r\n\r\n=Case 555.= (ARINSTEIN, September, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian private, 30, brought to a field reserve hospital, June 20,\r\n1915, was in a grave condition diagnosed typhoid. By the end of June\r\nthe general condition had improved and the temperature had fallen.\r\n\r\nJuly 9, worse; happening to be in the company of a sanitary in a\r\nprivy, he was observed suddenly to fall unconscious, with both feet\r\nand left arm paralyzed. Soon afterward he lost the power of speech.\r\nFrom September 30 to October 19, he lay in field hospital; but was\r\nthen transferred to the nerve hospital with diagnosis: convulsive\r\nparalysis and aphasia. At entrance, complete paralysis of both legs\r\nand left hand; loss of speech and aphonia (speech understood). Upon\r\ntouching a foot, strong convulsions developed with legs rapidly drawn\r\napart and drawn together much in the manner of dancing toys. The mouth\r\nwas twisted to the left. Though he silently opened his mouth and made\r\nrapid movements with the lower jaw, he could not utter a single sound,\r\neither vowel or consonant. Left hypalgesia. Hypesthesia of skin of hand\r\nand mucosa of tongue. Knee-jerks absent because of the strain of the\r\nmuscles of the legs. Wassermann negative.\r\n\r\nThe history showed that the speech of the patient had been incorrect\r\nand indistinct from childhood. Moreover, in 1908, in chopping wood in\r\nthe forest he had fallen under a sleigh and hurt his left hand, which\r\nhad not since fully recovered. He had volunteered for the war.\r\n\r\nThe psychogenic character of the disease seemed clear. Suggestion was\r\nfollowed by ether narcosis, during which, on pricks of the healthy side\r\nwith a pin, the patient made defensive movements with the paralyzed\r\nhands, and also moved both legs. Speech was not regained either during\r\nor immediately after the narcosis, although the patient gave forth\r\nindefinite sounds. Speech was restored on the same day, September\r\n7, with verbal suggestion and faradic brush applied to palate. The\r\npatient at once began to speak clearly and distinctly, read his prayer\r\nbook, and described distinctly and in detail how he went to war. From\r\nthat moment the convulsive movements in the feet disappeared, the\r\nregion of anesthesia on the left side narrowed, speech was permanently\r\nreëstablished, and the patient began to move with his feet and finally\r\nbegan to walk after six months of paralysis. Before that time no\r\nmedical treatment had had the slightest effect. The effort to stop\r\nmechanically the jerks even temporarily by means of plaster casts had\r\nbeen unsuccessful. In sleep the twitches ceased, but upon reawakening,\r\neven before full consciousness returned, the jerkings would resume. It\r\nis curious to note that upon falling asleep under the anesthetic the\r\npatient would issue always one and same kind of yells--“_Help, there\r\ngoes the German! They are shooting! Russians, do not yield!_”\r\n\r\n_Re_ chloroform anesthesia, Milligan remarks that the treatment should\r\nbe carried out in a quiet, single room, with the chloroform slowly\r\nadministered and the suggestions made by the anesthetist during the\r\noptimal phase for suggestion,--just before the stage of involuntary\r\nstruggling.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; unconsciousness: Mutism and musical alexia. Cure by\r\nanesthesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 556.= (PROCTOR, October, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA private, 23, was admitted to the Duchess of Connaught’s Hospital at\r\nTaplow from Gallipoli, September 10, 1915. A shell had exploded behind\r\nthis man. He had been picked up, unconscious, and remained so about a\r\nday. He recovered without the power of speech. Cerebration was slow at\r\nfirst but improved steadily.\r\n\r\nThe man had been a professional musician. Curiously enough, though his\r\nability to read ordinary print was as good as ever, his reading of\r\nmusic was lost with the speech.\r\n\r\nSeptember 20, he was etherized, but being of a phlegmatic type, he\r\nwas not readily excited and took the anesthesia very quietly. After\r\nperseverance, however, he was induced to talk. The ability to read\r\nmusic returned with the voice. He was discharged, October 4, 1915.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the use of anesthetics for curing deafmutism, Colin Russel rather\r\ndisapproves of this method on the ground that no attempt is made to get\r\nat the genuine pathogenesis of the case and that accordingly there may\r\nbe a tendency to recurrence.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the peculiar musical alexia, see discussion under Cases 353 and\r\n450 of confusion and amnesia. The most highly selective amnesias\r\nhave been found in confusional cases. However, Case 556 had been a\r\nprofessional musician and the effect may have been a highly specialized\r\nsuggestion. See also Case 369 of Feiling for differentiated musical\r\ndisorder. Mott has used the retained knowledge of tones as an avenue of\r\napproach in certain mute cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock; burial (24 hours?); unconsciousness, 13 days: Deafmutism.\r\nChloroform narcosis cured the deafness (!), not the mutism.\r\n\r\n=Case 557.= (GRADENIGO, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn Italian infantryman was buried under Mt. Zebio after shell\r\nexplosion. After 24 hours he was found and dug out. He remained\r\nunconscious for 13 days and came out absolutely deaf and mute.\r\n\r\nAt hospital he was markedly depressed and cried very readily on being\r\nspoken to. The tympanic membrane had lost its sensitiveness to pain.\r\nAs for the speech mechanism, the larynx proved negative. All the\r\nmovements of the soft palate, tongue and vocal cords could be normally\r\nperformed. The tongue was anesthetic to touch, but the taste function\r\nwas perfectly preserved. The cheeks and various parts of the face were\r\nalso anesthetic to touch, and the lobules of the ears could even be\r\npierced with large pins without reaction by the patient.\r\n\r\nHe tried to pronounce labials, opening and closing the lips rapidly;\r\nbut the expiratory movement was too weak, and not a single sound was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAt the patient’s request, he was chloroformed. During a very violent\r\nexcited phase, he did emit groaning sounds. The narcosis, however, did\r\nnot put an entire stop to the mutism, since only a few inarticulate\r\nsounds could be emitted, and those only after great efforts. Curiously\r\nenough, however, the chloroform narcosis had caused the _deafness_\r\nto disappear entirely. Another narcosis upon the patient’s insistent\r\nrequest was given but remained without results, and at the time of\r\nreport, the patient though cheerful and intelligent-looking, was still\r\nmute.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatment of two cases.\r\n\r\n=Cases 558 and 559.= (SMYLY, April, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier was out with a bombing party when a shell burst. He came to\r\nin a casualty clearing station, and was sent on to Salonica, deaf, dumb\r\nand jumpy. Two months later, an attempt at hypnosis failed; faradism of\r\nvocal cords failed.\r\n\r\nThe patient dreamed one night that if he vomited he could speak. Ipecac\r\nproduced vomiting without speech. The patient, however, wanted a second\r\ndose, and while waiting for it, uttered an exclamation, which he did\r\nnot himself hear, however. In the meantime, Dr. Smyly had been trying\r\nto hypnotize a second soldier, dumb but not deaf. This man’s dug-out\r\nhad been blown in on him seven months before, whereupon the patient\r\nbecame very shaky, but did not become sick for a week. He was then\r\nsent to hospital, and his voice gradually disappeared. He suffered\r\nfrom violent headache and spasmodic movements of the arms and legs.\r\nSuggestion seemed powerless, and ether was unexpectedly given to the\r\npatient. While going under the ether, he said, “Oh dear, oh dear”\r\nseveral times indistinctly. It seems that another physician had already\r\ntried to cure the patient of dumbness by removing teeth without an\r\nanesthetic.\r\n\r\nWhile this therapy was proceeding with the dumb man, the deaf-and-dumb\r\nman disappeared. It seems that the smell of the gas had caused him to\r\ntake refuge on an outhouse-roof. The next day he had recovered voice\r\nand hearing completely, partly from shock and partly through suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe etherized patient did not recover voice but lost the spasmodic\r\nmovements and his insomnia. A week later ether was again administered,\r\nand the patient was strapped down; as he was coming to, faradism was\r\napplied to the head and face. The patient then quickly recovered his\r\nvoice and still retains it.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell wound: Hysterical dysbasia from contracture. Many methods of\r\ntreatment fail. Success with “a new measure,” _e.g._ stovaine.\r\n\r\n=Case 560.= (CLAUDE, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA sergeant was struck in the suprapubic region, December 15, 1915, by a\r\nshell fragment and got a large hematoma in the perineal region (shell\r\nfragment visible on X-ray). The man was treated a year in a center for\r\nphysiotherapy and was then treated in a neurological center, where a\r\nfaulty position of the right thigh maintained in extensor rotation and\r\nabduction was found. The patient walked on crutches, legs wide apart,\r\nbalancing with body.\r\n\r\nUpon transfer to Bourges, an intraspinal injection of stovaine (after\r\nwithdrawal of 2-3 cc. fluid, 1 cc. stovaine, 0.07 to the cc., mixed\r\nwith cerebrospinal fluid) was made. This reduced the contracture and\r\npermitted the patient to place his legs parallel. They were then\r\nbandaged in the parallel position. The bandages were removed two days\r\nlater and the limbs did not reassume their faulty position. The man was\r\nshortly able to walk with a cane; progress was rapid. This man was very\r\ndesirous of cure and refused to be invalided, believing he was to be\r\ncured, and had received medal and war cross. Simple motor reëducation\r\nin competent hands had been without effect. A new kind of measure, such\r\nas stovaine, proved successful.\r\n\r\n_Re_ “new measures” for hysteria, see items under Case 516. See also\r\nremarks upon cures by lumbar puncture under Case 488.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurial: Hysterical dysbasia. Treatment by stovaine anesthesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 561.= (CLAUDE, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA chasseur, buried June 24, 1916, had a number of general symptoms,\r\napparently got well and was given seven days’ leave at home. On the way\r\nhe felt abdominal pain which he thought due to the jolting of the car.\r\nSuddenly he felt his legs trembling on extension. He left the train\r\nand went into a hospital where a diagnosis of radicular and spinal\r\nlesions was made. Two months later he was sent to Claude who found that\r\nhe could walk only with knees flexed. If he was requested to stand up\r\nand extend his legs on the thigh, a trembling set in suggestive of an\r\nepileptoid trepidation. Even in the horizontal position the same clonic\r\ntrepidation occurred which only stopped if the patient flexed his legs\r\non the thighs.\r\n\r\nHowever, no sign of organic lesion could be found. There was an\r\nanalgesia limited to the ankles. Psycho-physiotherapeutic treatment was\r\nunavailing. January 28, 1917, the stovaine injection method was tried.\r\nAfter anesthesia had set in, it was found possible still to produce the\r\nspastic state by extending the legs; but a half hour after injection\r\nthe spastic state could no longer be produced. The patient was shown\r\nthat the trepidation was abolished. During the period of return of\r\nsensibility, the legs were constantly moved and the patient constantly\r\ntold to make movements himself. He was convinced of his power. There\r\nwas no longer any clonus. The patient remained all day in bed without\r\nepileptiform movements. Next day he complained merely of weakness in\r\nthe legs and was got to walk without having convulsive tremors. During\r\nthe next few days he began to walk with a cane, later without support,\r\nand there were no more contractions except transiently in the left leg\r\nif the patient walked a little too long. He left the hospital cured.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock deafmutism: Psychic treatment.\r\n\r\n=Case 562.= (BELLIN and VERNET, January, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in a colonial regiment was sent, August 14, 1916, to an\r\nevacuation post with a diagnosis “deafness following shell-shock, unfit\r\nfor service.” The patient asked that he be spoken to very loud because\r\nhe could not hear, and he himself spoke in whispers. He kept watching\r\nhis interlocutors’ lips and moved his own as if to pronounce the words.\r\n\r\nA shell had burst nearby fourteen months before in June, 1915. After\r\nbeing in several hospitals, he was sent to an oto-rhino-laryngological\r\nservice where he had his hearing reëducated and was taught lip reading.\r\nIt was soon perceived that he could hear without lip reading and he\r\nwas assured that he could be cured at once, but naturally he was not\r\nconvinced. He produced a carefully filed paper stating “atrophic\r\nozenous rhinitis, deafness from labyrinthine shock following shell\r\nexplosion, hearing diminished 60 per cent right, 30 per cent left.”\r\n\r\nHowever, energetic psychotherapy was started and in the absence\r\nof electricity, subcutaneous injections of ether were given. Such\r\npatients had always been cured, and a drug injected under the skin,\r\nnot dangerous but extremely painful would cure him! This treatment was\r\ncarried out in a dugout near enough to the lines to be daily “potted.”\r\nThe patient was left for a space to reflect, and he finally accepted\r\nthe chance of cure. He was exhorted to stand courageously the pain and\r\nto breathe deeply and to repeat a word more and more loudly. Finally\r\nhe was made to speak normally and eventually to cry out loudly. He now\r\nfelt much astonished, and in his astonishment forgot his deafness. He\r\nsaid that he had never spoken or heard since the accident, that he had\r\nbeen a deafmute from the first month of his illness, and that for the\r\nlast three months he had been able to speak only in a whispered voice.\r\n\r\nHe should have been watched a few days to confirm the cure. This was\r\nimpossible in the crowded dugout and no risk could be run of his\r\nescaping. Kept over night he was found next day unable to hear and\r\ntalking in the same voice as before.\r\n\r\nHe was now found to be either an exaggerator or a simulator. He was\r\ngiven a half hour to exercise his voice in and told that he must\r\nsucceed unless he was a simulator. At the end of half an hour it was\r\nfound that he had skipped. He was sent back by the division surgeon\r\nwith orders to send him to the otological service for inquiry. The\r\notological service found an atrophic ozenous rhinitis, a normal larynx,\r\nperfect audition. He was given a psychic X-raying and a few electric\r\nsparks were also drawn from his neck. He then began to talk in a loud\r\nvoice and to hear normally. August 30, he was sent out completely cured\r\nand rejoined his regiment.\r\n\r\n_Re_ treatment of deafmutism by other means than pseudo operations\r\nand anesthesia, see remarks under Case 556 concerning Colin Russel’s\r\nopinion that anesthesia does not get at the true genesis of cases. _Re_\r\nthe teaching of lip reading to Shell-shock deafmutes, see discussion\r\nunder Case 580.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrachial monoplegia. Cure by electrical suggestion (physician\r\nbored-looking, brief, and authoritative).\r\n\r\n=Case 563.= (ADRIAN and YEALLAND, June, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAdrian and Yealland had occasion to treat an officer with a persistent\r\nfunctional paralysis of the arm, which had successfully withstood\r\nhypnotism, psychoanalysis, rest, massage, anesthesia with ether, and\r\npainful electrical treatment.\r\n\r\nThis patient knew something of the functions of the brain and was\r\nprepared to discuss his condition exhaustively. He was told, however,\r\nthat he had come to be cured and that the nature of his cure would be\r\nexplained to him afterwards. Without further discussion, the motor\r\nareas of the cortex were mapped out rapidly. The measurements were\r\nrepeated aloud to impress and mystify the patient. He was assured that\r\nas soon as the shoulder area of the cortex was stimulated faradically,\r\nhe would be able to raise his shoulder, and that then the rest of his\r\narm would recover. An exceedingly mild faradic current was then applied\r\nto the scalp for a few moments and he was then ordered to move his\r\nshoulder. He did so at once. In a few minutes, all of the paralysis had\r\nvanished and the patient could raise 30 pounds. Adrian and Yealland\r\nbelieve that the success here was largely due to the fact that the\r\npatient was not allowed to discuss the case or criticize the treatment\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that the patient should be convinced that the\r\nphysicians understand the case and can cure him. No physical sign\r\nshould be examined as if it were interesting or obscure. An attitude of\r\n“mild boredom bred of perfect familiarity with the patient’s disorder”\r\nis cultivated. If the case is exhibited it should be exhibited “as a\r\nperfect example” of the type of case that is cured in five minutes by\r\nappropriate treatment. “Rapidity and an authoritative manner are the\r\nchief factors in the reëducative process.”\r\n\r\n_Re_ psychoelectric treatment, see Yealland’s book, published while\r\nthis compilation was going to press, _Hysterical Disorders of Warfare_,\r\n1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrachial monoplegia following use of sling after bruise or wound.\r\nTechnique of electrical suggestion and rapid reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 564.= (ADRIAN AND YEALLAND, June, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAdrian and Yealland give the following typical case of paralysis of the\r\narm as a very frequent and very curable form of war neurosis, occurring\r\nas a rule after a slight wound or bruise necessitating the use of a\r\nsling. The patient, having received a slight wound of the forearm,\r\nfor months had a useless arm, which he could move but slightly at the\r\nshoulder on exerting a superhuman effort. Occasionally he could flex\r\nthe fingers through a small angle. There was complete anesthesia of the\r\nhand and arm of long-glove type. This anesthesia was not complained\r\nof, and might not be noticed until suggested to the patient by the\r\nphysician. It is well to elicit the anesthesia, however, in view of the\r\ntreatment to be applied. There was no wasting of muscles; the sensory\r\nloss was typical of hysterical anesthesia; nor could the whole arm\r\nhave been involved by an injury that did not affect the upper arm and\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nThe patient was told that he was very lucky to have come off with such\r\na slight injury; his arm was to be set right in five minutes by the\r\napplication of a special form of electricity. He was then made to sit\r\non a large pad electrode connected with an induction coil; the other\r\nterminal is connected with a wire brush. The first effect, he was told,\r\nwould be the return of feeling in the forearm; power would return with\r\nthe feeling. The wire brush with a fairly strong current was drawn\r\ndownwards over the forearm from elbow to wrist. He was told that he\r\ncould now feel as far as the wrist, and a pin was used to convince him\r\nthat he could thus feel. If he had not felt the pinprick, the current\r\nwould have been increased in strength until he could feel. The hand was\r\nnow treated in the same way.\r\n\r\nHe was now told that, as feeling had returned to the arm, the power\r\nof movement would be restored shortly. Adrian and Yealland remark\r\nthat laymen seem to consider that loss of power and loss of feeling\r\nare inseparably connected. The electrode was now used to produce\r\ncontraction in the muscles. Under these circumstances, the arm will be\r\nused hesitatingly, with an appearance of great effort; but the patient\r\nis nevertheless convinced that power is returning.\r\n\r\n“Rapid reëducation follows at once. He is given no time to think, but\r\nurged to move the arm more and more strongly, to grip the physician’s\r\nhand, to flex and extend the elbow, etc., and the pressure is not\r\nrelaxed until the whole arm has returned to its normal vigor. If\r\nrecovery is stationary, faradization is repeated with stronger and\r\nstronger currents. If it seems as though he might relapse on leaving\r\nthe hospital, he is told that this is very unlikely, but that if it\r\nshould occur, he should report sick at once and come back for treatment\r\nwith a current far stronger than that already used.”\r\n\r\nAdrian and Yealland claim that they have applied their combination\r\nof suggestion and reëducation in more than 250 cases (including 82\r\ncases of mutism, 34 of deafness, 18 of aphonia, 37 brachial or crural\r\nmonoplegia, 46 paraplegia, 16 hemiplegia, and 18 of non-organic gait\r\ndisturbance), and that although a majority of the cases have been\r\nof several months’ standing, treatment has been almost immediately\r\nsuccessful in at least 95 per cent of the cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nExposure in the retreat from Mons: Persistent hysterical sciatica.\r\nTreatment by faradism and verbal suggestion.\r\n\r\n=Case 565.= (HARRIS, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA soldier developed pains about the hips and down the right thigh after\r\ngetting wet through in the retreat from Mons, August, 1914. He was\r\ntreated for a period of nine months in various convalescent homes and\r\nmilitary hospitals, incidentally receiving forty baths at Droitwich. He\r\nhobbled on a stick, leaning upon the left leg and dragging the right\r\nstiffly. The thigh was tender and hyperesthetic.\r\n\r\nThe proper treatment of cases of hysteria, according to Harris, is\r\nstrong faradism, applied by a small electrode or wire brush to the\r\nmoistened skin. The stimulus is made powerful enough to force the\r\npatient to admit that he feels. The theory is that the powerful\r\nstimulation “breaks down the psychical auto-inhibition which produces\r\nthe hysterical anesthesia.”\r\n\r\nFaradism is only the first phase of the treatment. Verbal suggestion\r\nfollows. Building on the basis of the feeling produced by the faradism\r\nor on the basis of the ocular evidence of motion in the hitherto\r\nparalyzed muscles, the patient is informed that the electricity will\r\nnow be more and more strongly felt and that he will be cured in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe two elements in the therapy, then, are: encouraging verbal\r\nsuggestion and the suggestion afforded by the paraphernalia of a\r\ncomplex looking, noisy machine. The knowledge on the part of the\r\npatient that a powerful and mysterious stimulus, namely, electricity,\r\nis being employed is a third element of suggestion.\r\n\r\nPersistent hysterical sciatica, such as that of the present case, may\r\nrequire prolonged treatment. In this instance, the man was completely\r\ncured in five minutes, so that he was made able to run across the room.\r\nHe said he would now be able to go back to the front, and wondered why\r\nhe could not have been cured before.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrognosis of intensive reëducation in reflex (physiopathic)\r\ndisorder--complete recovery (except for the hysterical fraction of the\r\ndisease) not expected.\r\n\r\n=Case 566.= (VINCENT, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA young soldier was superficially wounded in the left knee, in August,\r\n1914. A year later, he showed amyotrophy of the left calf, which\r\nmeasured 2.5 cm. less than the right, a weak slow Achilles reflex on\r\nthe left side, cyanosis and hypothermia of the left foot, weakness and\r\nlimitation of movements in the left foot, with slight contracture in\r\nflexion of leg upon thigh.\r\n\r\nThenceforward and for eight months, this soldier was submitted at\r\nthe Tours Centre to intensive reëducation. For two hours every day\r\nupon prescription he walked, ran, and hopped upon the left leg. In\r\nSeptember, 1916, after twelve month’s training, there was a certain\r\nimprovement in his disorder. The leg was now completely extended upon\r\nthe thigh, and the amplitude in the movement of the foot was almost\r\nnormal; but the amyotrophy, vasomotor disorder and certain electrical\r\ndisturbances remained quite unchanged. The man himself recognized that\r\nhis status was greatly improved, but he could not walk more than four\r\nor five kilometers without great fatigue.\r\n\r\nIn view of the inferior results of reëducation in some of these cases,\r\nshould any attempt at all be made to reëducate? Vincent thinks that\r\nthat should be; but that it should be borne in mind that sometimes no\r\nresults may be obtained. If the reflex disorder (in the Babinski sense)\r\nis minimal and the chief difficulty is hysterical, then sometimes\r\nthe man may go back to service after reëducation; but in intense\r\nexamples of reflex (physiopathic) disorder, invaliding has often proved\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n_Re_ values of intensive reëducation, Vincent’s technique and results\r\nhave logical resemblances to those of Yealland and of Kaufmann. Vincent\r\nestablished in the 9th district neurological center a method of\r\nintensive reëducation which is particularly suited to _old_ hysterical\r\ncases. He divides the treatment into three stages: First, the stage\r\ncalled by the _poilu_ by the picturesque name of _torpillage_;\r\nsecondly, the stage of fixation; thirdly, the stage of training.\r\nAccording to Roussy and Lhermitte, there are few cases at the front\r\nsuitable for the treatment of Clovis Vincent, which is especially\r\ndevised for the old cases. See under Case 574 for further details of\r\nVincent’s treatment.\r\n\r\n_Re_ prognosis of the physiopathic disorder, there has been some\r\ncontroversy in France. See discussion under Case 530. _Re_ suitable\r\ntreatment for physiopathic disorders, Babinski and Froment suggested\r\nthe application of heat. The warm bath test is also of value in\r\ndiagnosis. Babinski and Froment claim progressive improvements with hot\r\nbaths, hot air douches, and light baths--but counsel great prudence.\r\nThe improvement is never rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\nWound of calf; operations: hysterical contracture with “physiopathic”\r\nfeatures. “Brutally conquered” by reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 567.= (FERRAND, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA French infantryman, class of 1912, was wounded, May 12, 1915, in\r\nthe upper third of the right calf. His posterior tibial artery had to\r\nbe ligated. In a few weeks the wound was healed, but he began to walk\r\nbadly, presenting a contracture of the calf with retraction of the\r\ntendo Achillis.\r\n\r\nToward the last of 1915 a surgeon under the impression that the disease\r\nwas organic cut the tendo Achillis but the soldier could not walk any\r\nbetter. As he could not take the position of equinism, he semiflexed\r\nhis knee and walked upon a crutch.\r\n\r\nAnother surgeon was now found to perform a tenotomy on the flexors of\r\nthe leg and put the patient in a plaster cast to correct the flexion\r\nand immobilize in extension. This second operation was in July, 1916.\r\nThe patient now walked without a crutch.\r\n\r\nHe was then sent to a neurological center, Dec. 8, 1916, walking\r\non two canes, right leg in forced extension on thigh, in permanent\r\nand absolute contracture. All movements except leg flexion could\r\nbe executed, though slowly and weakly; but positive movements were\r\nimpossible, except flexion of the knees. There was no sensory disorder.\r\nReflexes were normal save that the leg reflexes were a little stronger\r\non the affected side, and the patellar reflex on that side was\r\nnullified by the contracture. Electrical reactions proved normal. There\r\nwere marked trophic disturbances of the right foot and of the lower\r\nthird of the lower leg. There was a certain amount of edema, cyanosis,\r\ncoldness and thickening of skin; marked muscular over-excitability of\r\nthe distal extremity of the leg. In short, Ferrand was here dealing\r\nwith a case of Babinski’s group of the so-called physiopathic cases.\r\nThe man was somewhat feeble-minded, and anxious and a trembling\r\nsuppliant for cure.\r\n\r\nHe was put, December 15, in a reëducation room and by means of fatigue,\r\ninduced by violent physical exercises, was (Ferrand states) “brutally\r\nconquered.” The contracture after a half hour of physical movement of\r\nflexion and extension of the leg ceased. The patient was shown how\r\nhe could himself both flex and extend the limb himself; he was then\r\ncaused to do this spontaneously. These active movements were aided and\r\nat times provoked by somewhat painful galvanic discharges. The patient\r\nthen walked slowly, and flexed both knees to the maximum. He was cured\r\nafter a treatment of 2½ hours. There were, of course, some (surgical)\r\nintra-articular adhesions in the knee and it was necessary for the\r\npatient to break these adhesions. An X-ray had shown the bone to be\r\nintact. A slight hydrarthrosis developed the next day, but a few days\r\nlater he was able to walk as well as anyone. For five weeks he followed\r\na training platoon in the reëducation work and was evacuated, January\r\n23, 1917, to his station, though he had entered the neurological center\r\nwith the idea that he was to be invalided with a pension.\r\n\r\nHe had a few relics of physiomotor disorder when he left, including\r\nthe abnormal delicacy of skin and muscular over-excitability above\r\nmentioned. On the basis of this and similar cases Ferrand believes\r\nthat, although the physiopathic group of Babinski exists, it does not\r\nsignify a separate clinical syndrome and the occurrence of physiopathic\r\nsymptoms does not contraindicate psychotherapy.\r\n\r\n_Re_ this controversy, see remarks under Case 530.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Paraparesis. Cure by electricity.\r\n\r\n=Case 568.= (TURRELL, January, 1915.)\r\n\r\nTurrell, in a paper on electrotherapy at a base hospital, narrates\r\na case of spinal concussion which rapidly yielded to the persuasive\r\ninfluence of Bergonié’s machine for electrically provoked exercises.\r\nTurrell grants that such a rapid cure would probably be attributed to\r\nsuggestion, but thinks that the term _demonstration_ might be preferred\r\non account of the vigor and amplitude of the muscular contractions\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nThis soldier was driving an ammunition wagon at the front, when a shell\r\nexploded under the wagon, killing one horse and severely wounding\r\nthe other. The patient himself was blown into the air, fell, dragged\r\nhimself to a trench where he lay all night, and found himself in the\r\nmorning unable to walk or stand. He recalls that pins were stuck into\r\nhis legs by the examining medical officer and that they produced no\r\nsensation. When he was finally brought to the Third Southern Medical\r\nHospital, he was unable to draw up or move his legs, or to stand up\r\n(yet neurologically normal).\r\n\r\nAfter a few days’ rest in bed, he found himself able to walk a few\r\nsteps with assistance, and was then transferred to the Radcliffe\r\nInfirmary for electrical treatment. This treatment consisted in\r\nelectrically provoked exercises to the back (positive) and seat and\r\nthighs (negative). He was able to walk back to his ward, leaning on\r\na wheelchair. Next day he walked to the electrical department with\r\nsticks, and after the exercises were repeated, he was found able to\r\nwalk without assistance. On the third day, the Morton wave current was\r\napplied to the back, to clear up any persistent stiffness. The patient\r\nwas then discharged on sick furlough.\r\n\r\n_Re_ the Morton wave and similar applications of electricity,\r\nZeehandelaar speaks of a high frequency hall fitted up at Berlin.\r\nTouching the walls of the hall with the finger elicited a powerful\r\nspark. The scheme appeared to be on a commercial basis, and it was\r\nproposed to start similar institutions for poor metabolism and neuroses\r\nin other cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nA year’s field service, gunshot; typhoid fever: Astasia-abasia:\r\nLourdes-like cure: Residual amnesia.\r\n\r\n=Case 569.= (VOSS, November, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier in service from the outbreak of war, shot in September,\r\n1915, afterward suffering from fainting spells, was treated in several\r\nhospitals. He developed a typhoid fever at Lindau, which was at first\r\ntaken for hysterical fever. Eventually he came to the observation of\r\nVoss, unable to stand and falling hysteria-wise if compelled to walk.\r\n\r\nThorough examination was made. It was emphatically explained to him\r\nthat there could be no reason why he should not stand or walk.\r\n\r\nA miracle occurred. From the second day of his hospital stay he\r\nnot only walked about but began to polish doors and windows with\r\ninexhaustible strength.\r\n\r\nBut when he was about to be told that he must now be looked upon as\r\nwell, the miracle was not so manifest. It now transpired that he had\r\nserious gaps of memory and disorders in recognition, a sphincter\r\ndisorder and ever since his typhoid incontinence with fluid feces.\r\n\r\nIn short, waking suggestion had caused a very prominent symptom to\r\ndisappear, but the total personality remained sick. According to Voss,\r\nthe procedures of Kaufmann are dubious just because they cannot stand\r\nthe test of time. Yet so far as the cure of this man’s astasia-abasia\r\nwas concerned, it was not at all unlike the cures wrought at Lourdes.\r\n\r\n_Re_ miracles of this sort, see cases of Colin Russel (503 and 504)\r\nas well as those of Veale (511 and 512). Voss’ arguments run parallel\r\nwith the contentions of various persons that the miracle cures (such\r\nas those by anesthesia, electric suggestion, and hypnosis), do not get\r\nsufficiently to the bottom of the affections in question. Buzzard,\r\nin the preface to Yealland’s book on the _Hysterical Disorders of\r\nWarfare_, remarks that the question of the ultimate prognosis in cases\r\nthus suddenly cured must be left unanswered.\r\n\r\n\r\nDysbasia after a fall: “Kaufmann” cure in six weeks.\r\n\r\n=Case 570.= (SCHULTZE, August, 1916.)\r\n\r\nSevere dysbasia, due to monoplegia of the right leg of sudden origin (a\r\nfall), was variously treated 64 weeks without effect.\r\n\r\nJuly 15, 1916, the patient walked in on a stick, and fell down on\r\ntrying to walk without. August 1, 1916, at 9 o’clock, he was rapidly\r\nexamined: Anesthesia to pain and temperature; inability to lift right\r\nfoot; the right knee could be lifted about a hand-breadth above the\r\nbody if the foot was supported.\r\n\r\nAt 9:10, a small electrode was applied: sensibility became normal at\r\nonce. Second application: leg raised much better. The man was told\r\nthat he was better and that his hand could be put under the heel.\r\nThird application: Leg raised 8 cm. The patient showed pleasure at the\r\nadvance. Fourth application (slightly increased strength): Patient\r\nable to stand and to lift knee with flexion at 135° while standing.\r\nWalking exercises under direction. At 9:30, five minutes recess was\r\ngiven for fatigue, whereupon the exercises were taken up again and\r\ntransition made from stationary running to walking without aid as well\r\nas a variety of other associated acts (grasping handkerchief instead of\r\nphysician’s hand, and the like). The patient became exhausted after 8\r\nor 9 minutes running about, and another pause was given.\r\n\r\nThe large brush electrode with stronger current was now given to the\r\nback and to the back of the right leg. Practice in slow walking,\r\nlifting knee, and holding hip joint firm. The patient became tired, but\r\nremained very willing. Exercises in pulling on stockings, in climbing\r\nstairs--the whole concluded at 10 o’clock, whereupon it was found that\r\nthe patient could walk alone for a distance of 50 meters. The patient\r\nwas a very suggestible one. It was striking that the patient in the\r\ntime between 9:35 and 9:40 minutes could walk better on the right\r\n(that is, the previously affected leg) than upon the left. Rest in bed\r\nand phenacetine were ordered, with the suggestion that in the morning\r\nhe would walk much better. He became irritated after the treatment but\r\ngrew quieter in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nOn August 3, he was found able to walk well, better when not observed\r\nthan when observed. August 5, he complained that his leg was worse\r\nand used a cane, without permission. He was roundly scolded by the\r\nphysician and threatened with being sent to bed if he did not practice\r\nearnestly. August 7, he was better, and confessed that he could not\r\nwalk as well on command as he could alone; the exercises were nothing\r\nbut a fraud and he could go out and beat everything up (_alles\r\nzerschlagen_) if he did not have to carry out such exercises.\r\n\r\nAugust 15, he was much better, quiet, and satisfied. The lameness was\r\npractically gone. August 30, there was no sign of lameness, even when\r\nhe was observed. According to Schultze, the Kaufmann method is not\r\nmerely an Erb tradition, and rather special measures need to be taken\r\nin executing it.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Kaufmann’s cure, Imboden sums up this “highly logical and brutal\r\nmethod” as a method in which powerful electric shocks and loud military\r\norders to perform certain exercises secure results. Imboden suggests\r\nthat relapses may follow, sometimes on the slightest provocation.\r\nMann states that Kaufmann’s method of suggestion and electric shock\r\nforms very good treatment; yet Mann states there have been two deaths\r\nunder this treatment: in both instances there was an enlarged thymus\r\nat autopsy. A better technique, especially the use of the faradic\r\ncurrent alone, might have avoided these deaths. Mann himself prefers\r\nto Kaufmann’s _Ueberrumpelung_ milder methods, such as rest. Kaufmann\r\nkeeps up the sitting until the man is cured, even if it takes two hours\r\nof electricity and staccato commands. For similar persistance, see the\r\ntreatment by induced fatigue of Reeve (Cases 489-493).\r\n\r\n\r\nWound of shoulder: Heterosuggestion of BRACHIAL paresis. Electrical\r\nsuggestion of muscular power. Recovery in five days.\r\n\r\n=Case 571.= (HEWAT, March, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA reënlisted soldier arrived at the Royal Victoria Hospital, as a case\r\nof ulnar paralysis. He had been wounded in France six months before by\r\na bullet which passed through the fleshy part of the shoulder, above\r\nthe middle third of the clavicle. Power in the right arm gradually\r\ndiminished; yet two months after the wound he seemed fit enough to be\r\nsent to Egypt. The paresis developed, and in a month’s time he was\r\ninvalided home. He had been unable to use a rifle for months.\r\n\r\nThe healed bullet wounds were found about the region of the brachial\r\nplexus. The patient was sure the bullet had damaged the nerves in\r\nthat region. The right arm and hand were limp and over-inclined to\r\nblueness, and the muscles were flabby. Active movements of all sorts\r\ncould be carried out with the arm but not against resistance. There was\r\na definite anesthesia and analgesia throughout, and responses to touch\r\nand pain stimuli were irregular.\r\n\r\nBy way of treatment, the patient had the muscles of the paretic arm\r\nstimulated electrically, and at the same time he was told that no nerve\r\nof the neck had been injured. He was greatly surprised to see his\r\npalsied arm move vigorously.\r\n\r\nA milk isolation treatment in bed behind screens was adopted, whereat\r\nthe patient was angry, looking upon the Weir-Mitchell treatment as\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, another electrical application secured complete power\r\nin the arm and abolished sensory disturbance. Three days later the man\r\nwent back to full duty. According to Fergus Hewat, someone doubtless\r\nhad suggested to this patient that he had received a nerve injury.\r\nHe had become obsessed thereby and developed a typical functional\r\nparalysis. This was a “cortical misinterpretation,” which disappeared\r\nupon forcible demonstration of the error.\r\n\r\n\r\nExposure; intestinal disorder in weakminded neuropath: Camptocormia and\r\nhysterical paraplegia: Cure by psycho-electric treatment.\r\n\r\n=Case 572.= (ROUSSY AND LHERMITTE, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA French territorial, 45, was observed at the Centre Neurologique,\r\nAugust 28, 1916. He was a victim of hysterical paraplegia with tripod\r\ngait. There was a stiffness of the lumbar vertebral column which had\r\nlasted six months. This paraplegia had begun spontaneously after cold\r\nand an attack of diarrhoea followed by constipation. The camptocormia\r\nand disorder of gait had come on gradually in the ambulance. He came\r\non a stretcher. He was found to be able to walk with great difficulty\r\nby leaning both hands on a cane. The two legs were tremulous in a\r\npseudospastic gait. The next day, after a single psycho-electric\r\ntreatment, cure was complete. This patient was mentally somewhat weak\r\nand a constitutional neuropath. He was discharged, cured, October 20,\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrachial monoplegia, hysterical (or feigned?). Found able to descend\r\nladder with arms only.\r\n\r\n=Case 573.= (CLAUDE, July, 1916.)\r\n\r\nClaude had a case of a soldier with right-sided brachial monoplegia,\r\nwhich had lasted for 18 months and defied efforts to cure. There was a\r\nquestion of simulation, and Claude handed the case over to Vincent.\r\n\r\nThe case came on service, June 20, and was seen June 21. He was then\r\ntreated and found able to descend a ladder applied to a wall with the\r\nhelp of his arms only. On June 24, he was found able to lift a weight\r\nof 10 kilos, and could now write with the right hand, although he had\r\nbeen writing only with his left. This man had looked like a simulator\r\nto many physicians. He may have been a simulator or an hysteric. In any\r\ncase, he was cured.\r\n\r\n\r\nVicissitudes of treatment of hysterical brachial monoparesis (shell\r\nburial).\r\n\r\n=Case 574.= (VINCENT, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA French private was buried in a trench upon the explosion of a large\r\nshell, November, 1914. He said he had had a “fracture of the occiput”\r\nand had fainted away without regaining consciousness for several hours.\r\n\r\nHe was evacuated to Dunkirk, then Saint Nasire, and then to\r\nSables-d’Olonne. He showed no paralysis or paresis of limbs. During the\r\nfirst month, he had violent pains in the head, spells and vomiting.\r\nThere was a slight aphasic disorder. He was treated by cupping upon the\r\nhead and by applications of ice.\r\n\r\nAfter the visit of the inspector general, he was sent to Nantes to be\r\ntrephined. Dr. Mathieu regarded an operation as useless. He was treated\r\nwith bromides and the faradic current by Miraillé, applied to the right\r\narm, which had become paretic.\r\n\r\nJune, 1915, he started on a three-months convalescent leave in Paris.\r\n\r\nFrom October to December, he had electric treatment at the Grand-Palais.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1915, he went to the Salpêtrière under P. Marie, where he was\r\ngiven electric treatment.\r\n\r\nJanuary 1916, he went to Maison-Blanche under Laignel-Lavastine, where\r\nhe was given electricity 4½ months.\r\n\r\nApril 4 he went back to his dépôt.\r\n\r\nPresented to the invaliding board, May 11, at Decize, he was sent to\r\nthe neurological center at Bourges. He was there given massage and\r\nmovements. Upon entrance he had a functional inactivity of the right\r\narm. He should have been cured a long time before by the therapeutics\r\nemployed. He was then sent to Vincent at the neurological center at\r\nTours for special motor reëducation. Vincent found almost complete\r\nfunctional incapacity of the right arm, without atrophy, with normal\r\nreactions, no R. D., and normal arterial pressure. June 26, 1916, the\r\npatient was able to write, although slowly. He could sign a letter, and\r\ncould lift a weight of 10 kilos.\r\n\r\nThe details of Vincent’s method mentioned under Case 566 are pursued,\r\nto use his own words, with _methodical ruthlessness_. This form of\r\nreëducation consists in manoeuvres that make the patients yield\r\ndespite themselves. The galvanic current is used to force a man to\r\nreact voluntarily or automatically. See, for example, Claude’s case of\r\na hysterical brachial monoplegic (Case 574) found able to descend a\r\nladder with the use of his arms only. After the physician’s victory is\r\nsecured, then a sort of consolidation must be obtained by means of the\r\nexecution of certain movements on the part of the patient for an hour\r\nor two. As another factor in the situation set up by Clovis Vincent,\r\nis the enthusiasm generated in the moral atmosphere in which the cure\r\ntakes place. Mott has also insisted upon this atmosphere of cure, which\r\nMott believes is in part responsible for the good results of Adrian and\r\nYealland. Roussy and Boisseau, at Salins, started out with a process\r\nsimilar to that of Vincent, with a preliminary period of isolation.\r\nRoussy also uses the faradic current instead of the galvanic (see\r\nremarks of Mann concerning deaths with the Kaufmann method in Germany,\r\nunder Case 570). Vincent’s three stages are given in Chart 19, page\r\n897.\r\n\r\n\r\nStruck by shell fragment; run over by shell; paresis and regionary\r\nsense disorder. Treatment by reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 575.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA German subaltern officer, 27, was wounded September 25, 1914, in a\r\nbattle in France. He gave the following account:\r\n\r\n“We had been firing without interruption four days, and then were sent\r\nback. While going back from cover we were under shell fire. Three or\r\nfour horses fell. I got a glancing blow from a shell fragment in the\r\nback of the head, and fell down. I was not quite unconscious. I tried\r\nseveral times to get up, but I could not, for I had very bad pains\r\nin the head and a confused feeling in it, too. I remember also that\r\na wheel ran over my foot, and that I got a sharp blow in the chest.\r\nThen I was unconscious for about an hour. When I awoke, there were two\r\ncomrades busy over me and they pulled me back of the firing-line. Then\r\nI got to a field hospital.”\r\n\r\nThe man arrived at the nerve hospital (Jena), October 8, 1914, with\r\ninsomnia, respiratory disturbance, sudden perspiration, feelings of\r\ncold in the right foot, and poor appetite. He had had nausea for a few\r\ndays. Lungs and heart proved normal. X-ray of the right foot showed\r\nnormal relations. The man was a small, powerfully-built man, well\r\nnourished, with lively reflexes, especially the knee reflexes, of which\r\nthe right was greater than the left; slight patellar clonus, right;\r\nleft plantar reflex greater than right; segmental disorder of touch\r\nand pain sense in the right foot and lower leg, a zone of analgesia\r\nlying above the zone of total anesthesia. Gait was lame on account of\r\ninability to move the right ankle joint. In walking, the right foot was\r\ntrailed.\r\n\r\nTreatment was suggestive and supported by active gymnastic exercises,\r\nbreathing exercises, exercises in moving the right leg, massage,\r\nfaradism and local hydrotherapy. The gait gradually improved, the cold\r\nfeeling disappeared from the right leg, disturbances of pain and touch\r\nsense disappeared. The patient was released on the 2d of February,\r\n1915, capable of garrison duty.\r\n\r\nWith respect to this man, who was married, he was from a healthy family\r\nand had healthy children. He is said, however, to have suffered from\r\nconvulsions for a long time in early life, but thereafter had never\r\nbeen sick in any way. He was a good student and had been a post-office\r\nofficial since 1908. After two years’ military service, he became, in\r\n1910, _Unteroffizier-Aspirant_. Later he was advanced to his subaltern\r\nposition in the reserve.\r\n\r\nThis case seems to be a characteristic example of segmental disorder of\r\nsensations of both touch and pain, combined with a paresis in the same\r\nregion. Mechanical and mental factors seem to have been present, and\r\nthe case belongs in what Binswanger calls the “hysterosomatic” group.\r\n\r\n_Re_ Binswanger’s so-called hysterosomatic group, he defines the cases\r\nas having emotional, mechanical, and toxic (gas) factors. On the whole,\r\nthey are best classified as a kind of psychoneurosis. Binswanger finds\r\nall physical and drug treatment without result except as supportives.\r\nHe has used hydrotherapy and electrotherapy with the perfectly clear\r\nconception that the procedures were of suggestive value only. In fact,\r\nBinswanger had before defined such procedures as _Realsuggestionen_ or\r\nmaterial suggestions. Common verbal suggestion, says Binswanger, will\r\nwork sometimes only when aided by these material suggestions. See also\r\nunder Case 576.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-traumatic (ANTEBELLUM) seizures with unconsciousness: Further\r\nseizures, astasia-abasia, anesthesias, following no special period of\r\nstress in field service. Recovery by reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 576.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nO. F., 26, healthy, of a healthy family, in military service,\r\n1908-1910, a miner in October, 1912, had fallen into a shaft from a\r\nconsiderable height, and is said to have been unconscious for three\r\ndays and two nights and to have had some sort of attack a short time\r\nafter waking. Later he had another attack, beginning with violent\r\nheadaches, running from the back to the fore part of the head, then\r\ndizziness, then a fall with unconsciousness. The whole attack lasted\r\nabout four minutes and was followed by feelings of extreme fatigue.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in the spring of 1913 these attacks had begun to repeat\r\nthemselves two or three times a week. In the spring of 1914 there had\r\nagain been two attacks at an interval of two weeks. They had occurred\r\non the way to work and had been introduced by the same symptoms as\r\nbefore. They lasted about half an hour.\r\n\r\nHe was in the war in France from August 6, 1914. While he was cooking,\r\none day, in the middle of September, he had an attack and this without\r\nspecial occasion. The next attack occurred a little while afterwards,\r\nat the time of an assault. He said that he fell down and lost his\r\nsenses. When he came to his senses again, he found he could not move\r\nhis legs.\r\n\r\nHe was taken to a reserve hospital in Germany, and while there had\r\nseveral attacks with unconsciousness and spasmodic convulsions--the\r\nlast on December 7, 1914. He was transferred to the Jena Hospital on\r\nthe 11th.\r\n\r\nThe Jena examination had the benefit of an inquiry concerning the case.\r\nIt seems that he had left the field hospital in the enemy’s country, in\r\na half-conscious condition, and rode away therefrom aimlessly. It was\r\nonly in Germany that he, on his own story, found his bearings again.\r\nHowever, upon admission the disturbance in walking was very noticeable,\r\nsince the patient came hobbling through the garden of the clinic with\r\nthe upper part of his body bent forward, and with the support of two\r\ncanes. The legs were moved with difficulty; he seemed to take short,\r\ntripping steps, with the toes dragging on the ground. His inability to\r\nwalk he explained through the violent pains which he would feel in the\r\njoints of the legs and an extraordinary weakness in his legs.\r\n\r\nPhysically, the man was a tall, strongly built and well-nourished\r\nsubject. Neurologically, the knee-jerks were somewhat decreased and\r\nweaker on the right side than on the left; the Achilles reflexes\r\nwere lively. The plantar reflex was not obtainable on the left side;\r\ndecreased on the right. The abdominal reflexes were absent on both\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nMost remarkable was the general diminution in sensitiveness of the skin\r\nto touch and pain, involving the whole body, up to the neck, where the\r\nsensory impairment abruptly ceased in a sharp line. The anesthesia\r\nwas not everywhere complete. In a few places pencil strokes were\r\nsuccessfully localized and recognized. Deep pin-pricks were everywhere\r\nrecognized as itching. When the trunk was everywhere examined on both\r\nsides symmetrically, a strong pressure with a pin-head was felt as a\r\nstrong pressure on the right side, but was felt not at all on the left\r\nside. Anesthesia and analgesia were total in the legs. Deep folds of\r\nskin could be punctured by needles without reaction.\r\n\r\nThe legs could be moved freely upon urgent request with the patient in\r\ndorsal decubitus. Still these movements were slow and difficult, as\r\nexplained by the patient, on account of violent pains in the joints.\r\nIf put on his feet, he would begin to sway greatly and permit himself\r\nto slide down to the ground, stating that he was quite incapable of\r\nstanding or walking without aid. With two canes, however, he could move\r\nfreely about in the ward and in the garden, and even with considerable\r\nspeed, in a peculiar, dragging, shuffling way; in the execution he gave\r\nno sign of pain, contentedly smoking a cigar or a pipe.\r\n\r\nWhile his status was being taken on admission, he became suddenly dull\r\nand irresponsive, with a staring look. He could not state his age or\r\nhis birthplace. However, he became clear shortly, upon urging, and\r\nexplained the spell by saying that the blood had risen to his head.\r\nA few days later, he was transferred to the psychiatric division. He\r\nwas given strict rest in bed, smoking was forbidden, prolonged baths\r\nwere used, and the legs were massaged. He felt very comfortable in the\r\nprolonged baths and could then move his legs without pain.\r\n\r\nA few days later he was taken out of bed several times a day, the canes\r\nbeing removed immediately, and he was led about the day-room with the\r\nlight support of two nurses. Being promised a cigar as a reward, he\r\nproved able to walk through the day-room supported by but one nurse.\r\nA week later the pains in walking exercises had disappeared. He had\r\nbecome able to walk alone, supporting himself lightly along the wall\r\nwith one hand. Walking was still uncertain and slow.\r\n\r\nDecember 20, the patient could stand free without support, swaying\r\nslightly; improvement became rapid. He could shortly stand and walk\r\nwithout support though his walk was still awkward and on a wide base\r\nwith knees pressed in and body bent forward, soles were kept applied to\r\nthe ground. December 22, the patient could walk in the garden without\r\naid.\r\n\r\nDecember 23, there was a spell of great weariness and complaint of\r\nbeing sick. The patient lay down on the bed, cried aloud, and had\r\nrhythmic twitchings and sudden movements with arms and legs. He\r\nscratched the right half of his face with his right hand. This spell\r\nlasted about a minute. It was repeated in the same way twice within the\r\nhalf hour.\r\n\r\nHe had complete amnesia for these attacks. The pupillary reactions were\r\nentirely normal in the attacks. He had been in bad spirits that day\r\nbecause a Christmas furlough had been refused. The attacks provoked\r\nno bad consequences and his gait improved. He was on furlough from\r\nthe 30th to January 3; on the 4th he was transferred to the nerve\r\ndepartment, but on the 12th of January he was reprimanded for a breach\r\nof discipline, whereupon at 9:15 he had an hysterical attack with the\r\nsame coördinate rhythmic motions as before. This attack lasted about 20\r\nminutes. Two hours before the attack he had complained of weariness and\r\na boiling-hot feeling in the body. Long walks were taken. On February\r\n15 he began to feel very happy. He was informed that the charge against\r\nhim for leaving his troop had been dropped. He complained of sudden\r\nweariness and headache and was markedly depressed, but he had no\r\nhysterical attack.\r\n\r\nAfter February 23 he took part regularly in gymnastics, executing the\r\nmovements with joy and without special weariness. He wanted to be\r\ndischarged. He was discharged as fit for garrison duty and he has since\r\ngone back to field service.\r\n\r\n_Re_ gymnastics, Binswanger holds that they have a special value\r\nin overcoming inner psychic resistances and weak-willed persons.\r\nThe _Realsuggestionen_ (see under preceding case, 575), such as\r\nhydrotherapy and electrotherapy, serve to concentrate the person’s\r\nattention on certain regions. These regional suggestions then smooth\r\nthe way for the curative suggestion, namely, the constant and\r\nmonotonously repeated assurance that recovery is advancing. At the next\r\nstage, according to Binswanger, gymnastic exercises may be brought\r\nin to overcome hopelessness, indifference, or exaggeration of morbid\r\nfeelings. Binswanger sets methodical tasks for the attention and the\r\nwill (a so-called _Uebungstherapie_). If these gymnastics lead to\r\nmanifest improvement, then a proper educational therapy is prescribed,\r\nwhich is no longer a merely exercise therapy, but consists of actions\r\nof actual value in hospital routine. The convalescents are gradually\r\nled to carry on housework, food service, gardening (the latter under\r\nsupervision). Hospital clerical work is a suitable occupation.\r\n_Re_ supervision over gardening, mentioned by Binswanger, Canadian\r\nexperience indicates that the idea of supervision may be greatly\r\nextended. Particularly is this true in vocational reëducation. Kidner\r\ndescribes the functions of a vocational counsellor, who has to have\r\nan expert knowledge of industry and methods of industrial training,\r\nas well as an acquaintance with the varying demands for workers, a\r\nknowledge of the seasonal variations in employment, and a knowledge\r\nof occupational diseases. _Re_ occupational therapy, Todd estimates\r\nthat from 0.5 to 1 per cent of wounded men in France will require\r\nvocational reëducation. Occupational therapy is the proper vestibule to\r\nvocational training. He lists the following forms of treatment used in\r\ninstitutions for vocational reëducation:\r\n\r\n    Active mechanotherapy.\r\n    Passive mechanotherapy.\r\n    Galvanic, static, and faradic electricity.\r\n    Vibration.\r\n    Hot air baths and blasts.\r\n    Water baths.\r\n    Colored light.\r\n    Massage.\r\n    Gymnastics.\r\n\r\nCentral specialized institutions such as those developed in France\r\nare necessary, and such centres should be large rather than small,\r\naccording to Todd, and should contain not less than 200 beds. Todd\r\ninsists that work is, after all, the most important measure of\r\nreëducation; and Turner, speaking of the home for neurasthenics at\r\nGolders Green, says that during a period of three months (the number of\r\nthe patients is limited to 100, and three months is the limit of stay),\r\nthe vast majority, even of the most obstinate cases, get well through\r\nthe effects of sympathy and insistance upon work. Near Golders Green\r\nis the Maida Vale Hospital for nervous cases, so that in case of need\r\nthe physicians there may treat the patients. Salmon gives a list of the\r\noccupations which are suitable for these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlown up by shell; wounds, right side, distention and bloody urine:\r\nParesis of right foot and spasticity of hip; later rectal and bladder\r\nincontinence.\r\n\r\n=Case 577.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA Russian from the Ukraine was received at the nerve hospital, Jena,\r\nDecember 12, 1914. Through an interpreter it was established that he\r\nwas a peasant, had been under shell fire in a skirmish at the beginning\r\nof November, and had been hurled (so he said) 1¼ meters into the air\r\nwithout loss of consciousness. There was a wound of the right shoulder\r\nand also, he thought, of the legs, from the air pressure. Becoming a\r\nGerman prisoner, he had been treated in various hospitals.\r\n\r\nHe was a strong man of medium height, with a healthy complexion. There\r\nwere two healed wounds of the right shoulder, and near the twelfth\r\nspinous process a third similar scar. There were a number of ulcers and\r\nfuruncles over the os sacrum.\r\n\r\nNeurologically, the knee-jerks and Achilles jerks could not be\r\nobtained, and the plantar reflex, extinct on the left, was weak on\r\nthe right. Sensitiveness to pain on both sides was lost from the\r\nknee downwards but there was hyperalgesia in the thigh. Inaccurate\r\nstatements in response to tactile tests were made, apparently on\r\naccount of lack of understanding. In lying down, there was a slight\r\nrestriction in the movements of the legs, and active movements of\r\nthe joints of the foot on the right side were impossible. Gait was\r\nataxic-paretic, more markedly so right than left. He could walk only\r\nwith two canes, and during walking the musculature of the thigh fell\r\ninto a spastic tension. The tongue deviated to the left. There were\r\nsevere rheumatic pains in the thighs.\r\n\r\nIt appears that some weeks before, this Russian soldier had suffered\r\nfrom severe rheumatic pains in both sides and was at that time\r\nabsolutely unable to walk or stand. At that time, however, there was no\r\nquestion of a crural paraplegia of organic origin, since the man could\r\nmove his legs well enough when in dorsal decubitus. There were no\r\nsigns of paralysis of the rectum or bladder at that time.\r\n\r\nTreatment at Jena consisted in regular walking exercises with support\r\nat the shoulders. The lower legs and feet remained weak and paretic.\r\nThe decubital ulcers disappeared.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of December rectal incontinence began, the stool being\r\ndischarged without the patient’s noticing it while being led to the\r\nbath. Later there was incontinence of feces in bed. Pains in the legs\r\nwere constantly complained of. Nevertheless improvement in walking was\r\nmaintained. The toes were dragged at every step and the knee-joints\r\nwere thrown outward in walking. The musculature of the lower legs was\r\nweak. Knee-jerks could not be elicited more than before. He constantly\r\ncomplained of pains in the knees and right hip. The rectal disorder did\r\nnot again occur during January.\r\n\r\nToward the close of January, the patient’s right lower leg and left\r\nfoot would occasionally feel asleep; both legs felt cold and itched.\r\nIn a general way, however, the pains had become less marked than they\r\nwere at first. It seemed that he had no sensations at stool, and\r\nconsequently had to resort to the closet at a definite time. Moreover,\r\nurine was discharged irregularly and involuntarily when he coughed. It\r\nappears that a few days after receiving his wounds in battle, there had\r\nbeen pains on micturition as well as blood in the urine, and it appears\r\nthat he had been catheterized. It is probable that he had suffered\r\nfrom distention, as he described his abdomen, thighs and sex organs as\r\nswollen.\r\n\r\nIn February he began to be able to move alone with two canes through\r\nthe ward, but he moved his legs from the knee downward very little, and\r\ndragged them after the rest of the body. Upon galvanic examination, the\r\nperoneal and tibial nerve trunks were found normally excitable. At this\r\ntime the sensibility situation had changed somewhat, since complete\r\nanalgesia was present only in the foot, and hypalgesia had developed\r\nupon the anterior surfaces of the lower legs. Pin-pricks were described\r\nas touches. The posterior surface of the left lower leg was normally\r\nsensitive. There was an oblong stripe about 3 cm. long, beginning in\r\nthe popliteal space and stretching downward on the left side. The\r\nright lower leg was entirely insensitive. The posterior surfaces of\r\nboth thighs as far as the gluteal folds were completely insensible\r\nto pain. The Wassermann reaction of the blood was negative. In this\r\ncondition the patient was transferred to a prison camp hospital.\r\n\r\n_Re_ bloody urine, see Section B, Case 202. _Re_ rectal incontinence,\r\nit might be inquired whether this was possibly functional. Roussy\r\nand Lhermitte devote a chapter to visceral disorders. They do not\r\nlist rectal incontinence amongst the disorders noted in this war, nor\r\nhave any cases of hysterical anorexia or disorders of sensation in\r\nthe intestinal tract been seen during the war despite the occurrence\r\nof these latter disorders in the civilian group. The main digestive\r\ndisorder that the war cases show is vomiting (see Cases 495 and 500).\r\n\r\n\r\nEmotionality: Shell explosion; mutism. Recovery by reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 578.= (BRIAND and PHILIPPE, September, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA plumber, 27, went into the infantry. He was very emotional and was\r\nbut a short time in the trenches when the explosion of shells threw him\r\ninto a state of mutism. Deafness, rather curiously, did not manifest\r\nitself for several days. He had to go back on horseback, and, as he was\r\na poor horseman, slipped off the horse, giving himself a bad fright.\r\nWhen he got up, he had lost his hearing.\r\n\r\nHe was sent to several hospitals and finally to Val-de-Grâce, in July,\r\n1915. He recovered hearing in fifteen days, but the mutism persisted\r\nseveral months. According to Briand and Philippe, this is a typical\r\ncase, except for the duration of the mutism. The first treatment was\r\ngiven this patient August 6. His respiration was examined and tracing\r\nwas taken. August 15, on the morning visit, he was found able to\r\nwhistle very distinctly the first bars of “Au Clair de la Lune,” and\r\nthen began to sing the first verses, articulating distinctly, but\r\nstammering a little. He was now left to his own resources, without\r\nspecial exercises, from August 15 to September 26, and completely lost\r\nthe benefit of his previous exercises. A week of special treatment\r\nallowed him to recover speech again, enough to take up every day life.\r\nThe patient went out well.\r\n\r\nThe general lines of the examination in this case took up attitude\r\nin abdominal respiration and the question of respiratory pauses,\r\nespecially pauses in abdominal respiration, which, in the above case,\r\nwere exaggerated. Expiration was deficient and disordered. The normal\r\nadaptations that had been established during his childhood learning of\r\nspeech had failed, and the patient would not have been able by himself\r\nto regain proper balance of respiration for speech.\r\n\r\nThe examination was continued to learn the difficulties of innervation\r\nof the muscles of phonation whose proper delicacy had been lost. Such\r\na patient is a kind of bad gymnast, executing an exercise known to be\r\nhard by contracting all the muscles of the region, both the antagonist\r\nand the agonist muscles. Reëducation must, therefore, endeavor to sweep\r\naway the contractions that block sound. Then the patient must be made\r\nto perform the contractions necessary in phonation and articulation\r\nunconsciously. The methods used for teaching children might here be\r\nemployed, but more elaborate and designed methods can be used with the\r\nadult, _e.g.,_\r\n\r\n    1. Breathing exercises, especially with the idea of making\r\n       respiration complete.\r\n\r\n    2. Blowing exercises.\r\n\r\n    3. Whistling.\r\n\r\n    4. Vowel sounding.\r\n\r\nSéguin and Rouma, on the other hand, counsel beginning exercises with\r\nconsonants in stammerers and dyslalics.\r\n\r\n_Re_ tests for functional deafness, Ranjard states that on account of\r\nthe complexity of Shell-shock deafness, exact diagnosis needs to be\r\nmade. Examination of the hearing by speech alone, or by the watch-tick,\r\nyielded poor results; and an accurate mathematical acoumeter (_Sirène\r\nà voyelles_, Marage) is recommended. See especially chapter on the\r\nfunctional examination of audition in Bourgeois and Sourdille’s _War\r\nOtitis and War Deafness_, a work translated and highly recommended by\r\nthe English otologist, Dundas Grant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days’ skirmish on East front: Unconsciousness, later delirium,\r\nstill later (six weeks) stammering, hysterical stigmata: Recovery by\r\nisolation and reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 579.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA traveling salesman in civil life, 36, as a non-commissioned officer\r\ntook part in severe fighting in the East shortly after the outbreak of\r\nthe war. He was under violent shell fire at one time for five hours at\r\na stretch. In the middle of November, after a skirmish in the woods\r\nwhich had lasted for three days, he was found unconscious. According\r\nto his own story, he was awakened from this unconsciousness about a\r\nweek later in a hospital. He described himself as quite unable to say\r\nanything about what had gone on during that week.\r\n\r\nThe medical report on the case stated that he arrived at the hospital,\r\nNovember 18, in a dormant state of mind. He had appeared markedly\r\nexcited and kept incessantly talking about military matters, such as\r\nthe placing of machine guns, the occupation of the edge of the woods\r\nby his company, addressing the nurse as “Captain,” and the sister as\r\n“Mrs. Captain,” making as it were an official report to them. He showed\r\nshyness, and always an extreme excitement. His hands and legs were in\r\nconstant motion; he complained of headaches and itching finger-tips.\r\nSleep could be achieved only by drugs. This mental state lasted till\r\nNovember 26, when he became oriented. Sleep improved, but he complained\r\nof pains in the back of the head.\r\n\r\nUpon transfer to a convalescent home, December 5, he was still\r\noccasionally excited and sometimes sleepless. On December 30, the\r\npatient began to stammer; his speech had before this been somewhat\r\ndifficult, but the stammering began suddenly; speech was indistinct and\r\nslow; syllables failed to follow one another at like intervals. The\r\nheadache at this time radiated from the middle of the top of the head\r\nto the side of the neck. There was a complaint of vibrating pains on\r\nthe two sides of the vertebral column, and a feeling of weakness and\r\nunsteadiness in walking. The patient would sway with eyes closed and\r\nturn sidewise. The heart action was tumultuous, the pulse irregular and\r\nuneven.\r\n\r\nThe patient was transferred back to the reserve hospital on January 2,\r\n1915, whereupon the stammering became worse, sleep restless, and arms\r\nand legs subject to spasmodic pains and twitching. On January 25, he\r\nwas removed to the Jena Hospital. He remarked that at the convalescent\r\nhome he became very much excited at the Christmas celebration and had\r\nto cry, whereupon his speech became more and more difficult; he could\r\nnot find the beginnings of words and had to stammer. Upon admission\r\nhe also complained of sharp pains in the soles of the feet and in the\r\nfinger-tips.\r\n\r\nNeurologically, there was marked dermatographia, the deep reflexes were\r\nincreased, abdominal reflexes were absent; there were points of pain\r\non pressure in both supra-orbital regions, and there was a general\r\nhypalgesia with the exception of the head, the lower legs, the feet,\r\nthe scrotum, the penis and the anal region. Pin-pricks were recognized\r\non the right side only, when the patient was tested bilaterally. They\r\ncould be recognized on both sides when the patient was examined on one\r\nside at a time. There was a static tremor on both sides (?). He could\r\nmove his arms, but in dorsal decubitus he could move his legs only\r\njerkily and uncertainly. His gait was waddling with dragging of toes.\r\n\r\nThere was a marked photophobia. The palatal and swallowing reflexes\r\nwere in excess; speech was hesitant and stammering. The first letters\r\nof words, especially initial consonants, could be pronounced with\r\ndifficulty, explosively with cheeks blown up, after several attempts.\r\nThe consonant would be repeated several times before the vowel could\r\nbe added. The patient’s name was Singer, and he would pronounce it: _S\r\n… S … S … Si … n … n … ger_; the last syllable (_ger_) being brought\r\nout with a strong accentuation. The whole process took five seconds.\r\nThe word _Flanelllatten_ took 14 seconds. It seems that the patient\r\nhad already suffered (in 1907) from nasal catarrh and disturbance of\r\nhearing from stoppage of the Eustachian tubes. Another attack in 1908\r\nhad been accompanied by an irritating cough, and there seems to have\r\nbeen catarrh on the right in 1913, as well as cerumen on the left side.\r\n\r\nTreatment: The patient was isolated; in the next few days there was\r\nimprovement in the headache. The patient complained of muscular\r\ntwitchings, which would occur suddenly in different parts of the body.\r\nOn February 1 there was a subjective feeling of happiness since all\r\npains had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe patient was given regular exercises in speaking and there was\r\ngradual improvement in speech. Body-weight increased, regular walks\r\nwere taken, and the patient occupied himself with garden work.\r\n\r\nBy June, 1915, he had still further remarkably improved, working now\r\nall day long, partly in the garden, partly in the hospital office.\r\nDisturbance of speech was not noticed except for hesitation before the\r\nlast syllables of long words during comparatively long conversations.\r\nAll trace of difficulty in walking had disappeared. In this patient no\r\nhereditary taint could be proved. He appears to have been of normal\r\ndevelopment, serving in the army from 1901 to 1903. In his life as a\r\ntraveling salesman, there was frequently catarrh of the throat, and\r\nin 1912 there was a marked swelling of the vocal cords with extreme\r\nhoarseness and inability to speak, which condition was cured after\r\nlocal treatment.\r\n\r\n_Re_ hysterical speech and voice disorders, Binswanger has found them\r\namongst the most obstinate conditions, often persisting when all other\r\nhysterical phenomena have dropped away. He states that apparently the\r\ncure of some of these cases must be postponed until the end of the war.\r\n\r\n_Re_ general results of the therapeutic treatment of the war hysterias,\r\nBinswanger states that he has been able to send some cases back to\r\nthe front that have successfully stayed there. He has had failures,\r\nhowever, even amongst men who have had no _mauvaise volonté_ and have\r\nthemselves desired to be sent back to the front.\r\n\r\nGordon Wilson observed 250 cases of Shell-shock at the Ypres salient\r\nand on the Somme. Fifty of these cases complained of deafness, and 17\r\nof the 50 were found to have actual nerve deafness. Wilson treated\r\n“fixed idea” cases by hypnotism, and sometimes by cold water run into\r\nthe ear. He, in general, divides the cases in to (_a_) cases of nerve\r\ndeafness, (_b_) fixed idea cases, and (_c_) malingerers.\r\n\r\nMarage states that frequent exposure to the noise of shells for long\r\nperiods may produce a permanent deafness, as has long been known\r\nin naval gun-makers and boiler-makers in peace times. He advocates\r\nobturators, a good form being plasticine wrapped in gauze moulded to\r\nthe shape of the internal meatus. Celluloid plugs, sometimes used, have\r\nbeen known to be set afire by the flash of a shell. Cerumen sometimes\r\nprotects against deafness, but Mott speaks of the driving of the wax\r\ninto the tympanum as a dangerous effect in certain shock cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURIAL by shell explosion: DEAFMUTISM. Treatment: phonetic reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 580.= (LIÉBAULT, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA machine gunner, 26, was buried at Rheims, January 5, 1915, by the\r\nexplosion of a large shell bursting over the dugout. He was unconscious\r\nthree days and deafmute on coming to, without amnesia but with a\r\nfeeling of constriction in the throat.\r\n\r\nAfter fifteen days in the ambulance he was sent for four months to the\r\nMaritime Hospital at Brest, and treated by hypnotism. Seven or eight\r\nsittings had no other result than to fatigue him. There were then three\r\nmonths of convalescence. Returned to Vannes, September 20, 1915, he\r\nwas put into the auxiliaries. As he could not work much he was sent,\r\nDecember, 1915, to the Hôtel-Dieu at Nantes. Here electric vibratory\r\nmassage was given, which secured a few hoarse sounds.\r\n\r\nPhonetic reëducation was then undertaken at Prés-à-goutrière, May 10,\r\nand his respiratory capacity increased from 170 the first week to 250\r\nand 300 the following weeks. His blowing strength was raised from 15\r\nto 20 to 25 at the same time. In a few weeks he was much improved and\r\nJune 27 passed on to his auditory reëducation. The respiratory capacity\r\nin this man was insufficient. He could not speak, but his respiratory\r\nmovements were good and he learned again to speak in a voice as good as\r\never.\r\n\r\nAccording to Liébault, it is a general principle that, if the\r\nrespiratory capacity is increased, the voice will clear or become\r\nbetter; but, if the respiratory capacity remains stationary, the voice\r\nwill not improve. It is the same with normal persons. A subject with\r\na very subnormal respiratory capacity cannot speak loudly, but, if\r\nhis respiratory capacity approaches normal, he can speak normally.\r\nAccording to Liébault, all cases of this sort have had some respiratory\r\nanomaly and each case must be systematically examined with the aid of\r\nanthropometric tables, including weight, height and chest capacity.\r\nThe vocal disorder is proportionate to the degree of functioning of\r\nthe phonating apparatus taken as a whole. It is not merely that the\r\nlarynx should be examined, but the motor side of the apparatus, the\r\nrespiratory muscles, the resonating apparatus, the lips, the mouth, the\r\nnasal fossæ and the pharynx.\r\n\r\n_Re_ curability of different types of war deafmute, Roussy and Boisseau\r\nmaintain that the type (_a_) that comes gesticulating, pointing to the\r\nears, and desirous of writing, is the type that responds most rapidly\r\nto psychotherapy. There are two other types less responsive: (_b_) is\r\nan apathetic type, with impassive and stupid facies, lies immobile\r\nin bed, or sits in a chair in mental confusion; type (_c_) shows a\r\nfacies of terror, looks haggard and anxious, confused, disoriented, and\r\npossibly delirious.\r\n\r\n_Re_ general treatment of deaf cases, Zange suggests that emotion\r\nshould not be aroused by intense auditory impressions, that he\r\nshould not be reminded of his shock, and should be kept as cheerful\r\nas possible. Zange states that he found the static electric current\r\nof service, and got good results in hysterical deafness of sudden\r\ndevelopment by applying a strong faradic current.\r\n\r\n\r\nA year’s service; leave: Hysterical aphonia developed at home.\r\nRespiratory gymnastics.\r\n\r\n=Case 581.= (GAREL, April, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA soldier, 35, went on leave August, 1915. Arriving at his farm, he had\r\na violent feeling of moral perturbation and suddenly lost his voice.\r\nWhen he returned from leave he seemed stupid, spoke very few words\r\nand seemed to look about in a vague and undecided way. He was several\r\nmonths in this state and sent January, 1916, to Saint-Luc.\r\n\r\nThe vocal cords were there found of a normal color and without\r\nparalysis. “It was, therefore,” remarks Garel, “a nervous aphonia\r\nsusceptible of instantaneous cure.” The patient was made to make a\r\nsound in the lowest tone possible. While he was making this attempt,\r\nsharp pressure was exerted upon the lower part of the sternum, to\r\nprovoke expiratory reinforcement. The sound emitted was loud, to the\r\ngreat astonishment of the patient, who, thus aided by suggestion,\r\nshortly began to talk aloud.\r\n\r\nIn this particular patient a temporary return of voice was readily\r\nobtained, but not maintained. Special exercises had to be instituted,\r\nwhereupon the patient immediately fell back into a complete aphonia. He\r\nwas then made to scan words, syllable by syllable, executing with his\r\narms classical movements of respiratory gymnastics, or sometimes with\r\nthe utterance of every syllable the epigastrium was manually compressed\r\nor the shoulders suddenly lowered. The patient could now read a book\r\nin a jerky manner, and after a few lines he could read without his\r\nshoulders being pressed.\r\n\r\nAnother plan was to have the man read or talk while walking. As soon\r\nas he was stopped and accosted, however, he lost his voice again. Up\r\nto the time of report it was impossible to secure a definite return of\r\nvoice, as the patient was not willing to associate words with peculiar\r\nmovements. It might make him ridiculous. Accordingly, the nurses were\r\nrequested not to fulfil requests unless they were made aloud. Recovery\r\nwas to be hoped for from this measure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWounded: Recurrent stammering: Reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 582.= (MACMAHON, August, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA young English officer, previously cured of stammering while a boy,\r\nfell to stammering again after being twice wounded. The impediment was\r\nof the laryngeal type. When spoken to he was often quite speechless. In\r\nShell-shock stammering, the chief difficulty according to MacMahon is\r\nin the production of voice consonants and vowel sounds. In mild cases\r\nthe trouble is best left alone.\r\n\r\nThis officer was anxious to pass into the regular army from the reserve\r\nto which he was attached. The stammering prevented this. He was treated\r\nnine months and improved rapidly. He passed through the trying ordeal\r\nof the medical board successfully and went to his regiment.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases the patient is taught how to fill his lungs properly.\r\nHe is taught to acquire an inferior lateral costal expansion in\r\ninspiration. During expiration the abdominal muscles are trained to\r\ncontract slowly and strongly, pressing the diaphragm upwards and\r\ndrawing the lower ribs downwards and inwards. This steady breathing\r\nproduces a sensation of repose in the stammerer. He is not to raise the\r\nupper chest and not to tense the throat, tongue or jaws.\r\n\r\nThe main vowel sounds are now taught. The main vowel sounds are oo,\r\noh, au, ah, a and ee. They combine in six ways, oh and oo in the word\r\nwound, ah and ee make the long i, au and ee in boy, oh and oo in road,\r\na and ee in rain and fair, ee and oo in new and you. There are also\r\nwords in which no main vowel or compound sounds appear, which may be\r\nplaced either on the open ah position or the closed ee position. Such\r\nwords as long, abbot, among, which are on the position of ah and such\r\nwords as it, sister, minister which are in the position of ee. The\r\nvoice consonants are b, d, g, j, l, m, n, r, v, w, y, z, w being oo\r\nsound and y the ee sound. The breathed consonants are c, f, h, k, p, q,\r\ns, t.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of stammering intensified by Shell-shock is more\r\ndifficult than that of Shell-shock stammering de novo.\r\n\r\n\r\nWound of face: Speech disorder. Recovery by reëducation in two months.\r\n\r\n=Case 583.= (MACMAHON, August, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAn officer was wounded under his left eye, October 7, 1916. His speech\r\nwas affected only five days later in a casualty clearing station.\r\nObserved by MacMahon, November 5, he was found to speak with great\r\ndifficulty and became exhausted after a few words. He was tensing all\r\nthe muscles in attempting to speak. Breathing advice was given and\r\ncounsel how to relax in the abnormal efforts.\r\n\r\nNovember 12, the officer, who was at Number One London General\r\nHospital, began to speak with more freedom. “I am getting a bit better.\r\nI feel I must keep quiet, and it comes after a bit. I think far quicker\r\nthan I speak.” He said that the breathing exercises had helped him most.\r\n\r\nNovember 15, he still spoke in a rather staccato way; but the words\r\ndid not check as they had. In a week further there had been so much\r\nimprovement that he was discharged with a prognosis of complete\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1917, he had recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell wound and burial: Camptocormia (psychoelectric treatment\r\nsuccessful in one séance) and lameness (long reëducative treatment\r\nsuccessful).\r\n\r\n=Case 584.= (ROUSSY and LHERMITTE, 1917.)\r\n\r\nAt a Neuropsychiatric Center, September 2, 1916, arrived a chasseur,\r\n29, showing lameness of a pseudocoxalgic type on the left side,\r\ncombined with an anterior camptocormia. The whole situation had lasted\r\na year. The chasseur had been wounded by shell explosion on the left\r\nside and was buried on July 29, 1915. He lost consciousness and had\r\nrespiratory trouble and mutism. His arched walk and lameness began\r\nAugust 20, 1915.\r\n\r\nHe had a number of terms in hospital and six months at the dépôt. He\r\nwas sent back to the front, June 20, 1916, being proposed for auxiliary\r\nwork. There was some mental weakness. After one séance of electric\r\ntreatment, the improper attitude of the trunk was corrected. The\r\nlameness, however, persisted and required long daily reëducation.\r\n\r\nThe patient was discharged cured, October 20, 1916, without lameness or\r\ncamptocormia. There were a few persistent lumbar pains.\r\n\r\n_Re_ treatment of war psychoneuroses, Roussy and Lhermitte recommend\r\nrational and persuasive psychotherapy after the manner of Dejerine,\r\nDubois, Babinski, and others. Hypnosis, they say, should definitely be\r\nrejected. Mental contagion must be staved off, and Roussy and Lhermitte\r\nbelieve that almost all cases are curable and should be sent back as\r\ncompetents.\r\n\r\nThey maintain that the medical officer himself plays the leading part.\r\nMany patients are “cured” when they find “good masters”; this mastery\r\nof the combined confessor and educator is greatly aided by prestige.\r\nHe must speak with authority, with “iron in the velvet glove”; but\r\nwith patience and persistence. If a long sitting fails, postpone work\r\non the pretext of resting the patient. The patient must not be early\r\nthreatened with discipline. Even exaggerators and malingerers must be\r\ntalked to as if neuropathic.\r\n\r\nA careful medical examination, besides correcting false diagnoses and\r\ndemonstrating hystero-organic associations, will give the patient\r\nconfidence in his physician.\r\n\r\nA new patient is more easily cured than an old one. In general,\r\npatients should be treated as soon as possible after the shock.\r\nContractures are habitually more persistent than paralysis; tremors and\r\ntic are more pertinacious than deafmutism; ante-bellum psychoneuroses\r\nare less easy to treat than cases developed by the war alone.\r\n\r\nThe neurological centers near the front, with their discipline,\r\ninaccessibility to friends, and nearness to the front, present a\r\nsituation which yields easier and quicker cures than the interior; but\r\nafter the two-years’ experience which proved this fact, according to\r\nRoussy and Lhermitte, many cases still get sent back into the interior\r\nfor many months,--cases that ought to be cured near the front. Cases\r\nhaving convulsive attacks get confinement in separate rooms; chronic\r\nneuropaths are kept in bed on a milk diet.\r\n\r\nThe general features of the treatment of psychoneuroses commended by\r\nRoussy and Lhermitte are summed up in what they call the psychoelectric\r\nand reëducative method, divided into four stages: A stage (_a_) of\r\npersuasive conversation; (_b_) isolation; (_c_) faradization; and\r\n(_d_) physical and psychical reëducation. Roussy and Lhermitte got\r\nduring six months in one of the army neurological centers, 98 to 99\r\nper cent of recoveries. Clovis Vincent, in a special interior hospital\r\n(see for Clovis Vincent’s treatment, a summary under Case 575). _Re_\r\nthe first stage of persuasive conversations, Roussy and Lhermitte\r\ndiscuss on the day of admission the general nature of the patient’s\r\ncondition, and place him in the atmosphere of cure, in contact with\r\nrecovered patients. The conversation takes place in the physician’s\r\nconsulting room. The patient is gotten to promise on oath that he will\r\nsubmit to any methods of treatment. Although one may pass from the\r\nfirst stage to the third or electrical stage, forthwith, Roussy and\r\nLhermitte recommend several days of isolation. The patient is placed\r\nin a separate room, and kept in bed on a milk diet. This isolation\r\ntreatment of Weir Mitchell allows reinforcement of the suggestion by\r\ntalks on the medical rounds, allows the patient, perhaps, to beg for\r\nthe electrical treatment, which he may have refused at first, and\r\nlengthens the period of observation. According to Roussy and Lhermitte,\r\nspontaneous recovery not infrequently takes place during this phase of\r\nisolation. Lameness of long standing, tremors, and deafmutism disappear.\r\n\r\nThe third stage is that of faradization, executed by the physician\r\nwith only such attendants as may be necessary to support the patient.\r\nAt first, the man lies nude upon the bed, but later may be treated\r\nwhile sitting, standing, walking, or running. Feeble currents are used\r\nat first; later stronger ones. The poles are applied to the affected\r\nparts, and sometimes to especially sensitive parts of the skin, such as\r\nthe ears, neck, lips, soles, perineum, and scrotum. Energetic treatment\r\nby the rapid method is indicated in the vast majority of cases,\r\nespecially at the front. If a case is seen early, the rapid energetic\r\ntreatment almost always cures at once. The success of the method\r\ndepends upon the production of a crisis, which ought to be produced\r\nat the first sitting. Sometimes this sitting has to be continued for\r\nhours. Some patients require two or three sittings; some, still more.\r\nInstead of faradism, a cold jet of water, or even painful subcutaneous\r\ninjections of ether, may be used.\r\n\r\nThe fourth stage is that of physical and psychical reëducation,\r\nimportant in long-standing cases. The various forms of physiotherapy\r\nare carried out by special assistants or head nurses, accompanied by\r\npsychotherapy, and if necessary by electricity. According to Roussy\r\nand Lhermitte, these reëducative methods used alone, without previous\r\nfaradic treatment, are not successful. Relapse follows premature\r\ntransference from the front to hospitals in the interior, and too early\r\nsick leave.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock deafmutism. Speech recovered by suggestion and reëducation;\r\nhearing by reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 585.= (LIÉBAULT, October, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA corporal, 20, was exposed to the shock of an aerial torpedo, January\r\n18, 1916, at Souchez. The torpedo fell a meter away. There was no loss\r\nof consciousness, but the patient was agitated for several hours, not\r\nknowing what he was doing. Evacuated to hospital, he remained several\r\ndays in a stupid state. He was completely deaf and remembered poorly\r\nwhat had happened. He made every effort to speak, but could not. His\r\nhead felt on fire. He could not open his mouth well and his lower jaw\r\nwas almost in a state of contracture. He felt that his tongue could not\r\nmove easily. In this status he remained until February, always trying\r\nto talk, but not succeeding.\r\n\r\nHe then arrived at Hôtel-Dieu. The mouth was now opening better and\r\nhe was in a better general status, though always feeling fatigued.\r\nVibratory massage was given to the laryngeal region. He was gradually\r\ngot to emit a few sounds in a low voice. He was sent, April 26, to\r\nPrés-à-goutrière. He was now somewhat vocal, but at times would become\r\ncompletely aphonic once more. The voice during the first few weeks of\r\ntreatment became better, and the respiratory capacity was increased\r\nfrom 450 the first week to 460 and 500 in the next two weeks.\r\n\r\nMay 12, he suddenly lost his voice again and wanted to commit suicide.\r\nHowever, in three more days he was able to speak normally again and has\r\nhad no relapse. He was then put under auditory reëducation and at the\r\ntime of report his hearing had slightly improved.\r\n\r\nLiébault remarks that during the time when the patient could not speak\r\nhis jaw muscles were contracted and his tongue could not mobilize well.\r\nHe could think words but could not articulate them. It was accordingly\r\nimportant to cultivate the normal functioning of these muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\nGassing; tracheitis; crash from airplane; unconsciousness: mutism;\r\nstammering. Reëducation; hypnosis.\r\n\r\n=Case 586.= (MACCURDY, July, 1917.)\r\n\r\nA lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps, 23, described as “unusually\r\nnormal,” a successful business man, athletic, socially popular, had\r\nbeen for a year in the Infantry. He was caught suddenly in a gas\r\nattack, and, though he recovered after a few days in bed, had a severe\r\ntracheitis and laryngitis. The lieutenant had been very proud of his\r\nvoice and its carrying power. He went to a laryngologist in London, who\r\nsaid that he would never be able to sing again--a matter of some worry.\r\n\r\nHe soon became an expert airman. In the spring of 1917 he was shot\r\nat by antiaircraft guns in a trip over the enemy’s lines. One of the\r\nwings was hit and so weakened that in landing the lieutenant crashed to\r\nthe ground. He was unconscious for three hours and on coming to tried\r\nto shout to his servant in the distance, who, on arrival, found the\r\nlieutenant quite unable to speak.\r\n\r\nAccording to MacCurdy, there was here a conversion hysteria with\r\nregression to the tracheitis that followed the gassing. The mutism\r\nMacCurdy regards as a pathological degree of an effort of protection\r\nfor his voice. In hospital three weeks later he learned to whisper a\r\nfew words, though with great mental effort. He regained the voiced\r\nsounds by coughing and then saying “ah.” Stammering now developed.\r\nNot more than one or two words could be said at a breath. Training to\r\nsay two, three, four and then five letters in one expiration yielded\r\nimprovement in the stammering. Under mild hypnosis, to the degree\r\nmerely of distraction, normal speech was re-attained. There was no\r\nrelapse. Singing was then practiced and in a period of six weeks the\r\nsinging voice was virtually as good as it ever had been.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock: Loss of consciousness, possibly hemorrhage from head:\r\nSpontaneous gradual recovery from anesthesias in three months: Recovery\r\nfrom paralysis by reëducation in a few more weeks.\r\n\r\n=Case 587.= (BINSWANGER, July, 1915.)\r\n\r\nA German youth of 19 volunteered at the outset of the war as a motor\r\ncycle rider. About the end of October, he was hurled from his wheel by\r\na shell which struck close beside him and exploded, knocking his back\r\nagainst a pile of beams. He lost consciousness. There may have been\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\nHe came to, two hours later, in the dressing station, hardly able to\r\nmove his limbs. Such movements as he could make were painful. There\r\nwas an evident contusion of the back. He had a fainting fit after his\r\nbath in the field hospital and then could get to bed only with support.\r\nSevere pains in the legs, especially in the knee.\r\n\r\nIn the reserve hospital, there was a second similar fainting spell,\r\nfollowed by buzzing in the head, feelings of pressure in the chest and\r\nan irregular pulse; all of which phenomena disappeared the morning\r\nafter the fit.\r\n\r\nA careful examination about the middle of November showed the\r\npersistence of a severe paresis of the left arm, and a less marked\r\nmotor weakness of the right arm. Both legs were paretic, and there\r\nwere no spontaneous movements of the leg. This paresis of the legs was\r\ncombined with complete anesthesia and analgesia. Sensory impairment was\r\nfound only in the right arm and trunk, and there was no evidence of\r\nsensory impairment in the left arm. Both motor and sensory disturbances\r\nof the arm disappeared rapidly.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the beginning of December, 1914, the complete insensibility\r\nof the lower extremities up to the groin still persisted. The\r\nanesthesia then began to retreat, so that four days later, the upper\r\nlimit of anesthesia was somewhat below the groin. There could be found\r\na circumscribed area of anesthetic skin over the os sacrum up as far as\r\nthe second vertebra of the os sacrum; but the skin around this area,\r\nas well as over each tuber ischii, gave normal sensation.\r\n\r\nThe anesthesia continued to retreat: to the middle of the thigh at the\r\nmiddle of December; to a level 3 cm. above the knee-cap at the end of\r\nDecember; to the upper end of the knee-cap on the right side and the\r\nmiddle of the left knee-cap, January 1. January 11, the anesthesia had\r\nretreated to a level 10 cm. below both right and left patella. February\r\n8, sensibility in the legs had entirely returned.\r\n\r\nWhile the anesthesia was pursuing this favorable course, the motor\r\nsymptoms failed to improve to any marked extent, although active motion\r\nof the legs with the patient in dorsal decubitus had gradually returned\r\nto a limited degree.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis upon arrival at the Jena Nerve Hospital was “rheumatism\r\nof the left side of the body and dislocation of the spine.”\r\n\r\nThe treatment consisted at first of rest in bed and moist dressings of\r\nthe legs, but the treatment had to depend greatly upon the diagnosis.\r\nThe patient complained of difficult micturition; yet there were no\r\nother positive signs of organic disease, of spine or cord.\r\n\r\nHysteria was the diagnosis preferred to rheumatism, despite the fact\r\nthat examination at the Jena Hospital failed to show any disorder in\r\npain or tactile sense.\r\n\r\nThe patient was a rather tall man of slender build, with a slightly\r\naccentuated second pulmonic sound, decidedly increased tendon reflexes,\r\nweak plantar reflexes, and many points painful on pressure in various\r\nparts of the head, over the spine, and in the sciatic regions. The\r\nvertebral sensibility to pressure was most acute in the region of\r\nthe third, fourth, and fifth thoracic vertebrae. There was a marked\r\ndermatographia. There was no other sensory disorder and no motor\r\ndisorder of the arms, though the left hand-grasp was weak. All passive\r\nmovements could be successfully carried out with the legs. Upon bending\r\nat the hip, there were subjective feelings of tension in the posterior\r\nparts of the thighs. In active motion there was a marked limitation in\r\nleg movements, which appeared to be executed with great difficulty with\r\nbut small excursion and with considerable trembling. The knee-joint\r\ncould be flexed only when the sole of the foot had support. The lower\r\nleg could not be extended. The excursion in the joints of the feet and\r\ntoes was slight. Muscular strength was in general decreased. There\r\nwere no feelings of pain in muscular action but merely feelings of\r\ngreat effort. Gait was slow, shuffling, unsteady, hesitating and only\r\npossible with support. Fatigue set in after a few steps. In walking,\r\nthe legs could hardly be bent at the knee. The soles of the feet\r\ndragged on the ground. The patient was unable to stand upright, and\r\nwhen placed upon his feet, anxiously and stiffly clung to some support.\r\nWithout support, he fell over backwards. When supported he could move\r\nhis legs at the hip and lift the feet from their base by bending the\r\nknee-joints. The patient could not sit in a chair or in bed except with\r\nsupport; otherwise he would fall to the right side. In dorsal decubitus\r\nhe complained of pain in the loins.\r\n\r\nWith this hysterical picture, treatment of a psychotherapeutic nature\r\nwas carried out. The patient was given methodical exercises in walking\r\nand standing, during which affirmative suggestions about his new\r\ncapacity to walk and stand were given with monotonous repetition.\r\n\r\nFor the first fortnight he walked with the support of two nurses for\r\na half hour every day. He was very industrious and willing to execute\r\nthis treatment; and later began to exercise with a cane. Two days\r\nlater, he omitted the cane and found himself able to walk about without\r\nsupport. He was shortly able to stand without swaying, although for\r\nsome time the walk was upon a rather wide base and somewhat slow and\r\nsuggestive of spastic paresis.\r\n\r\nThe general condition of this patient remained good. His appetite and\r\nsleep were good. After the middle of March, 1915, there were no more\r\npeculiarities in walking, and the patient was able to take somewhat\r\nlong walks in the city and vicinity. He applied for work in the airship\r\ndivision, for which he already possessed some experience.\r\n\r\nThe youth appears to have been of a normal mental and bodily\r\ndevelopment, though his mother is said to have been nervous and a\r\nsister died of convulsions in childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nShell-shock with loss of consciousness: Deafmutism, rhythmic head\r\nmovements, anesthesia, asymmetrical areflexia. Recovery by suggestion\r\nwith faradism, massage and reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 588.= (ARINSTEIN, September, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA Russian private, 30, literate, lost consciousness upon the explosion\r\nof a large shell, November 10, 1915. He was brought to hospital,\r\nNovember 14, completely deaf and dumb, and with his head rhythmically\r\nswaying sidewise 60 to 70 times per minute. The swaying ceased during\r\nsleep. The head was carried inclined to the right; there was complaint\r\nof headache. The left leg, the trunk and the hairy part of the head\r\nwere anesthetic. The knee-jerks were obtained with difficulty, the\r\nAchilles jerks were lively; the throat and conjunctival reflexes were\r\nabsent; the abdominal and cremasteric reflexes were lively. The right\r\nplantar reflex was absent; the left normal. The vision of the right eye\r\nwas impaired, and there was a monocular diplopia of this eye. The drum\r\nmembranes were pulled in, and the disorder of hearing was explained on\r\nthe basis of labyrinthine shock.\r\n\r\nAfter a séance of written suggestion with faradism to neck and small\r\npalate and vibratory massage to throat, speech returned. November 26,\r\nthe patient read in a loud voice a written phrase. He did not speak\r\nagain independently until early in December, when he read aloud written\r\nmatter. The return of spontaneous speech was gradual. Hearing returned\r\nDecember 5, when he was able to hear in the right ear by means of a\r\ntube. In the sitting posture there was less swaying of the head. If the\r\npatient lay down, rhythmic movements of the head became stronger and\r\nmore rapid (120).\r\n\r\n\r\nShell explosion; unconsciousness: Amnesia; paralyses. Reëducation.\r\n\r\n=Case 589.= (BATTEN, January, 1916.)\r\n\r\nA corporal in the Belgian army was mobilized when the war broke out,\r\nand was in action continuously in the retreat from Liège, in the siege\r\nof Antwerp, and finally on the Yser until October 27, 1914, when the\r\nexplosion of large shells rendered him unconscious. He recovered\r\nconsciousness only in hospital at Calais. Though he was able to see and\r\nhear well, he was dazed and remembered nothing of what had happened. In\r\nfact, he did not understand what was said to him.\r\n\r\nIn a week’s time, his memory and intelligence returned, save for\r\nperiodic attacks in which he was dazed. From the very beginning he had\r\nbeen quite unable to move his legs, and at first the arms were weak. He\r\nhad a series of attacks of violent struggling in November and December,\r\n1914, which the corporal himself called fainting attacks, claiming\r\nthat he did not move his legs in the attacks but only his arms. In\r\nfact, he claimed that he could move neither head, body, nor legs, but\r\nonly the arms. He said, “Sometimes I try hard and set my teeth, but\r\nI do not know how to move my head and my legs; I try but they do not\r\nmove.” Sphincter control was maintained. Although he could see, when he\r\nattempted to read, everything went black.\r\n\r\nHe was finally admitted to the National Hospital for the Paralyzed and\r\nEpileptic on July 8, 1915, on the service of Major Walshe. He was thin\r\nand wasted. He was firmly convinced, according to the notes of Major\r\nWalshe, that he was seriously paralyzed. He said he could not lift his\r\nhead; when his body was lifted, his head fell back, or rather perhaps\r\nwas definitely thrown back, lolling about alarmingly. However as he lay\r\nin bed he frequently lifted his head unconsciously and placed his hands\r\nunder it. When asked to lift his head, the sternomastoids were strongly\r\ncontracted, but at the same time the neck extensors also, so that the\r\nhead was stiffly and strongly held in an extended position. Despite\r\nthe patient’s statement that he could not move the trunk muscles, he\r\ncould turn over readily in bed, and when trying to move the head the\r\ntrunk was fixed in a strong opisthotonos, and the abdominal walls were\r\nrigid. When requested to move his legs, he made no movement whatever,\r\nthough during head movements the legs were strongly fixed in extension.\r\nOn passive movements, there was no active muscular resistance. There\r\nwas an indefinite blunting of all kinds of sensations. Reflexes were\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nMajor Walshe worked hard with the patient, inducing him first to lift\r\nhis head from the pillow, and finally to move the legs. In three weeks’\r\ntime, the corporal could just sit up, and at the end of another month,\r\nhe was able to stand in the walking machine. At the end of a third\r\nmonth, he was walking upon crutches, and at the end of another, he\r\ncould walk upon two sticks with his feet wide apart, moving as if glued\r\nto the floor. To quote Batten, “The corporal will eventually get well\r\nbut not, I think, before the end of the war.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE. EPICRISIS[8]\r\n\r\n    Così od’ is che solava la lancia\r\n      d’Achille e del suo padre esser cagione\r\n      prima di trista e poi di buona mancia.\r\n\r\n    Thus I have heard that the lance of Achilles,\r\n      and of his father, used to be occasion\r\n      first of sad and then of healing gift.\r\n\r\n                        Inferno, Canto XXXI, 4-6.\r\n\r\n    [8] Material is here drawn _passim_ from the compiler’s\r\n    SHATTUCK LECTURE on =Shell-shock and After=, read before the\r\n    Massachusetts Medical Society, Boston, June 18, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMINOLOGY\r\n\r\n=1.= =Shell-shock, a lay term, usually refers to the medical entity or\r\ndisease-group: functional neurosis, or more briefly, neurosis.=\r\n\r\nThe history of the term Shell-shock will repeat that of Railway\r\nSpine in the last century; the term will fall into disuse when the\r\ncases subsumed thereunder get their exact medical diagnoses--which,\r\n_statistically speaking_, will prove to be as a rule psychoneuroses,\r\neither hysteria (pithiatism), neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion,\r\n“prostration”), or psychasthenia (obsessive neurosis).\r\n\r\n=2.= =But the laity cannot be got to use the term Shell-shock in this\r\nexact sense, because the laity cannot make exact diagnoses.=\r\n\r\nIn the post-bellum and reconstruction period the physician will need\r\nto guard against regarding all cases _called_ Shell-shock as really\r\nneuroses, merely on the ground that Shell-shock is _probably_ neurosis.\r\nLaymen will in the reconstruction period succumb to the lure of the 100\r\nper cent and gossip about cures and failures in the same loose manner\r\nthat is but too familiar in discussions of Lourdes, Christian Science,\r\nthe Emmanuel Movement. It will be worth while to preserve a certain\r\ngenerality and comprehensiveness for the term Shell-shock, which will\r\nstand to medicine as the term weeds stands to botany.\r\n\r\n=3.= =In short, keep the connotation but try not for any denotation of\r\nthis lay term Shell-shock in the lay mind!=\r\n\r\nThe dangerous history of the term _dementia praecox_ may be recalled.\r\nNeither _dementia_ nor _praecox_ is an exact term except for the\r\nstatistical majority of cases of schizophrenia. Yet does not the layman\r\nhearing the term _dementia_ feel entitled to assume that a victim must\r\nbe _demented_ or become so?\r\n\r\n=4.= =The term Shell-shock appears to be a perfect term for the\r\nordinary man, as it means much and little, connotes enormously and\r\ndenotes a minimum and casts the lay hearer back upon the expert.=\r\n\r\nBut confronted by the term _Shell-shock_, the ardent social worker or\r\nthe ordinary man fails to get any incorrect notion about the nature,\r\nand especially about the prognosis, of the condition. If there is any\r\nsuggestion of prognosis, it is the correct suggestion of curability\r\npossibly conveyed by the suddenness implied in the term shock; but\r\nI defy the ordinary man to get from the ordinary term Shell-shock\r\nvery much that denotes anything in particular. All he gets is an\r\nenormous connotation. This connotation may run back for the race into\r\ntree stumps, savages brandishing spears, palatial decorations, the\r\nprotrusion of animal spirits, the Leyden jar (sometimes familiarly\r\nknown as the “shock bottle”), and the aspen shaking of the man in\r\nfear or its interior equivalent. But whether the slang runs back so\r\nfar or no, and whether the shell is a shell of powder or a shell of\r\nfear, and whether the shock is of solid particles or in a moral sense,\r\nthe problem is implicitly laid down in the slang (see historical\r\ndiscussion, Shattuck Lecture).\r\n\r\n=5.= =The terminological difficulties are clarified somewhat by the\r\nFrench distinction of états commotionnels and états émotionnels in the\r\nShell-shock group.=\r\n\r\nThe French very neatly distinguish what they term _états commotionnels_\r\nfrom _états émotionnels_. They think of the _états commotionnels_ or\r\ncommotional states much as we think of _commotio cerebri_, that is, of\r\na physico-chemical happening in the brain of an essentially curable\r\n(or reversible) nature; that is, of something that falls short of\r\nbeing, as they say, _lésionnel_, namely, as bringing about a structural\r\nlesion. That is, they distinguish a brain with a visible focal lesion\r\nfrom one which has sustained a physical jar or commotion, and they\r\ndistinguish the effects of both of these from the _états émotionnels_\r\nor emotional effects of an injury. The nomenclature here brings out one\r\nof the most fundamental difficulties in the whole field of so-called\r\nShell-shock, namely, the distinction between structural conditions,\r\nmicroscopic or macroscopic, on the one hand, and functional conditions\r\nof a psychopathic nature, on the other. The _commotion_ would affect\r\nthe neurones themselves in some perhaps invisible but still genuine\r\nphysico-chemical way, whereas the _emotion_ would affect these neurones\r\nmerely after the manner of the normal emotional life, except that the\r\nneurones would perhaps deliver an excessive stream of impulses.\r\n\r\n=6.= =Terminology, especially in the matter of explanations to laymen=\r\n(Americans demand monosyllabic explanations as a preliminary to taking\r\nsuggestions!), =is not always assisted to clearness by physicians= on\r\naccount of the old ontological fallacy that Charcot insisted on.\r\n\r\nWould that the medical profession understood neuroses at their\r\ntrue value! Only too frequent is the impression on the part of\r\nthe profession that _imaginary_ symptoms are by the same token\r\n_non-existent_! I have even heard a physician well-trained in somatic\r\nlines say that Shell-shock did not exist because Shell-shock was\r\nnothing but neurosis, and neuroses were characterized by imaginary\r\nsymptoms,--accordingly neuroses, being imaginary, do not exist! All of\r\nwhich reminds us that many of the profession were entirely skeptical\r\nwhen Charcot made his original observations. Some men here in America\r\nfelt that, whereas hysteria might occur in Paris, it did not occur to\r\nany extent in America. The Shell-shock data of this war will abundantly\r\nprove to the profession the existence of the neuroses, and I feel\r\nthat physicians will have to brush up their ontology to the extent of\r\nconceding that _a symptom may be_ in a sense _imaginary and yet not_ in\r\nany sense _non-existent_.\r\n\r\n=7.= =Babinski points out a case of hysterical paralysis of a leg\r\nwhich led the patient to lean so heavily upon his arm as to produce an\r\norganic crutch paralysis.= It would be to no point to argue that the\r\nhysterical paralysis was here non-existent. Of course we shall have to\r\nmeet the false analogies drawn from methods of cure. If a paralysis can\r\nbe cured in a few minutes by the electric brush, or by hypnosis, or on\r\nemergence from chloroform, or by some other modern miracle.\r\n\r\n=8.= =Is it too much to ask the profession not ever to say that this\r\nrapid and seemingly miraculous cure was brought about because the\r\ndisease was non-existent?=\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSTIC DELIMITATION PROBLEM\r\n\r\n=9.= =The delimitation problem=, taken up in Section A, =is not\r\nidentical with the differentiation problem=, taken up especially in\r\nSection C but _passim_ in Sections B and D; by delimitation we may\r\nrefer to the process of localizing the diagnostic battle through\r\nexclusion of the other great groups of mental diseases that _à priori_\r\n=ought= not to come in question, but do come in question sometimes,\r\nbefore we slice down to the question.\r\n\r\n=10.= =Is there or is there not evidence of destructive lesion in the\r\nnervous system of this so-called Shell-shocker? Is this man a victim of\r\norganic or of functional neurosis? This latter is what may be termed\r\nthe differentiation problem.=\r\n\r\nConfining ourselves now to the delimitation problem, what are the major\r\ngroups of _mental diseases_ that might come in question?\r\n\r\nI shall enumerate these. We think of mental diseases as I, syphilitic;\r\nII, hypophrenic (that is, feeble-minded in some of its phases,\r\nincluding even slight degrees of subnormality not entitled to be called\r\nfeeble-minded in the ordinary sense); III, epileptic; IV, alcoholic\r\n(or due perhaps to some drug or poison); V, encephalopathic (in the\r\nsense of some focal brain disease); VI, symptomatic (in the sense of\r\nsome somatic disease); VII, senile (or presenile). The seven groups\r\nso far enumerated, I believe, the general profession is pretty well\r\nequipped to consider, at least roughly to diagnosticate and to handle\r\nwith due respect to the interests of the patient and of the community.\r\nI am bound to say that some of my colleagues would not go so far as\r\nto the competence of physicians in general in these fields, and one\r\nis aware that a plenty of mistakes have occurred even in these groups\r\nthrough the bad judgment of practitioners. Nevertheless, I hold to the\r\nconception that our profession is reasonably well equipped to handle\r\nthese greater groups, having in mind all the while the appropriate\r\ntemporary calling-in of the specialist. But there are two more groups,\r\nin addition to these seven, in which I am not so sure that the\r\ngeneral profession knows as much as it should. I refer to VIII, the\r\nschizophrenic group, commonly known as the dementia praecox group; and\r\nIX, the cyclothymic group, sometimes termed the manic-depressive group.\r\nIt is the victims of the diseases that constitute these latter groups\r\nthat ought unconditionally to be excluded with few exceptions from the\r\narmy; and it is the study of these conditions which ought to be carried\r\nout as a part of every man’s post-graduate training, not merely for his\r\nwork on draft boards, but for his work in civilian and reconstruction\r\npractice. There is another group of, X, psychoneuroses, with which the\r\nprofession regards itself as familiar, and with which it doubtless is\r\nfamiliar, in what might be called _blooming examples_ of hysteria,\r\nneurasthenia, and psychasthenia. But the nub of the situation lies in\r\nthe fact that the diagnosis of instances which are not such blooming\r\nexamples is difficult, and hence it was that I qualified my statement\r\nas to the competence of the practitioner in this tenth group. It is, of\r\ncourse, the tenth group, of psychoneuroses, into which the majority of\r\nthe Shell-shock cases fall.\r\n\r\n=11.= =Now a study of the literature of the belligerents having\r\nShell-shock in mind as its special topic and aim proves to require a\r\nstudy of war literature in all of these groups.= There are cases of\r\nso-called Shell-shock which even well-prepared medical men have placed\r\nin the neurosis group, when they should have been placed in one or\r\nother of the groups mentioned.\r\n\r\n=12.= In short, =whereas the Shell-shock delimitation problem deals=\r\nwith groups, I, II, III, IV, VI, VIII, IX and (as our compilation\r\nshows) =especially with groups I, III and VI=, on the other hand =the\r\nshell-shock differentiation problem= deals primarily with groups V and\r\nX.\r\n\r\nTo clear the decks for action _re_ the differentiation problem, let\r\nus dismiss the major troubles of the delimitation problem as shown in\r\ngroups I (syphilitic), III (epileptic), VI (somatic) and thereafter\r\nvery briefly refer to the residue of the delimitation problem. For\r\nconvenience of reference, a few out-standing remarks concerning the\r\ngeneral relations of these divisions to war and peace conditions are\r\ninserted here. We dealt in the diagnostic order of exclusion with\r\n190 cases, distributed as in the table below (bear in mind that the\r\nmethod of this book precludes attaching great statistical weight to the\r\ncomparative figures, since the various authors published their cases\r\nfor their special rather than their typical interest).\r\n\r\n       I. Syphilopsychoses                                      34\r\n      II. Hypophrenoses (feeble-mindedness and imbecility)      18\r\n     III. Epileptoses                                           33\r\n      VI. Pharmacopsychoses (alcohol; morphine)                 17\r\n       V. Encephalopsychoses (focal brain lesion cases)         15[9]\r\n      VI. Somatopsychoses                                       29\r\n     VII. Geriopsychoses (senile--a null class)                  0\r\n    VIII. Schizophrenoses                                       16\r\n      IX. Cyclothymoses                                          7\r\n       X. Psychoneuroses                                        12[9]\r\n      XI.

The syphilitic basis of sundry military\r\ndifficulties, quite unsuspected by the laity and probably not too well\r\nunderstood by service men, is suggested by Case 1, a case of desertion\r\nby a French officer of high rank. Nor is Case 2, in which visions of\r\nsubmarines proved syphilitic, without its warning. Such cases point\r\nonly too obvious a moral:\r\n\r\n=14.= =Neurosyphilitics have no place in the army or navy.=\r\n\r\nEight cases (Cases 3-10) follow in which the aggravation or\r\nacceleration or liberation of neurosyphilis has come about under the\r\nconditions of war. Some of these cases suggest the gravity of the\r\nproblems of compensation, allowance and pension that may arise. We\r\nmight ask,\r\n\r\n=15.= =Should not a government which enlists a syphilitic pay\r\nfull allowances to him when under war conditions he becomes a\r\nneurosyphilitic?=\r\n\r\nFor the government was theoretically able to learn at the start\r\n(within a small margin of error by means of the serum test) whether\r\nthe man was syphilitic. If a one-eyed man loses his remaining eye in\r\nan industrial accident in civil life, his damages are often fixed at\r\ndamages for total blindness; for the industrial firm should not have\r\nemployed a one-eyed man in an industry dangerous to eyes. The principle\r\ncannot differ with a man hired in a spirochete-bearing state: The\r\ncompany has hired a man who may under traumatic conditions become an\r\nincompetent neurosyphilitic, and should pay damages accordingly when\r\nthe aggravation begins.\r\n\r\n=16.= =What are the responsibilities of government if the neurosyphilis\r\nis due to a syphilis acquired during the war?=\r\n\r\nOften such infection may be due to a tragical form of “negligence.”\r\nBut, as pointed out in a work on Neurosyphilis, 1917, I believe\r\nthat any form of licensing system, official or virtual, which would\r\npermit the purchase of syphilis in or near military zones, abolishes\r\nthe argument of “negligence.” A man acquiring syphilis under the\r\nconnivance of government ought to stand as well as a syphilitic hired\r\nby the government, when it shall come to the question of compensation\r\nfor incapacity. Yet, it may be argued, the man might have remained\r\ncontinent after all. The point is left to the mercy of jurists.\r\n\r\n=17.= =The share of neurosyphilis in the “crimes” and disciplinary\r\nproblems of the army= is intimated in three cases (Cases 11 to 13).\r\n\r\n=18.= The latter part of the series (Cases 14 to 31) embraces =problems\r\nof a more medical nature, touching traumatic paresis and “Shell-shock\r\nparesis.”= Unusual, these cases may be readily conceded to be; but\r\ntheir infrequency is not such as to put them out of the field of\r\nconsideration in the “Shell-shock” group.\r\n\r\nVery intriguing to the diagnostician would be the cases of\r\n_pseudo_tabes and _pseudo_paresis (Cases 23 and 26 of Pitres and\r\nMarchand), were such cases at all frequent.\r\n\r\nCase 28, in which shell-shock (the physical event) apparently caused\r\nrecurrence of a syphilitic (!) hemiplegia, is particularly instructive\r\nand might better belong with the series (under Section B: Nature and\r\nCauses, Cases 286-301) in which _ante-bellum_ weak spots were picked\r\nout by shell-shock and war conditions. But Case 28 is placed here for\r\nits syphilitic interest.\r\n\r\nCase 29 stands out as a warning example not to crowd the hypothesis and\r\ntry to make syphilis sponsor for everything, even when it plainly is at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nCases 32-34 are cases in which syphilis played a part, though possibly\r\na minor part, in certain peculiar mental reactions.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the part played by syphilopsychoses and syphiloneuroses in\r\nthe war, we find, that\r\n\r\n=19.= =Syphilis may have occasionally a serious military effect=, as in\r\nthe case of desertion by a French officer of high rank.\r\n\r\n=20.= =Important problems of pension, retirement, and compensation\r\nare brought out=, and as no previous war has had the benefit of the\r\nWassermann reaction and other exact tests bearing upon the nature,\r\nprogress, and curability of neurosyphilis, we may hope for a far more\r\nscientific determination of these questions by review boards during and\r\nafter the war.\r\n\r\n=21.= We find a few instances in which neurosyphilis has played a\r\npart in the discipline of troops. According to one author (Thibierge,\r\n1917), syphilis has become a genuine epidemic among French soldiers\r\nand mobilized munition workers. In Germany, also, it may be remembered\r\nthat Hecht has claimed that no less than an equivalent of sixty army\r\ndivisions has been temporarily withdrawn from fighting on the Teutonic\r\nside for venereal diseases. In this connection, Neisser had recommended\r\nthe giving of salvarsan and mercury in the trenches. According to\r\nHecht, the appearance of syphilis should be a signal for sending a man\r\nto the front. Hecht also made the somewhat bizarre suggestion that\r\nspecial companies of syphilitics should be formed, for convenience of\r\ntreatment, on the firing line.\r\n\r\n=22.= A more solid foundation is laid for the theory that =general\r\nparesis= may be =evoked by trauma=--a conclusion already fairly well\r\nestablished by civilian cases, notably those of industrial accident.\r\n\r\n=23.= The question whether shell-shock (the physical event) can produce\r\ngeneral paresis is probably to be settled in the affirmative, for it\r\nmay always prove difficult to show that the physical shell-shock did\r\nnot actually produce mechanical molar lesions of the brain, permitting\r\nthe rapid advance of spirochetes. It is perhaps easier to prove that\r\nshell explosion may precipitate neurosyphilis in the form of tabes\r\ndorsalis (take, for example, Cases 21 and 22). The cases of most\r\nimportance in the question of traumatic neurosyphilis and traumatic\r\nparesis are cases 20, 21, 22, 24 and 25.\r\n\r\n=24.= The picking out of preëxistent weak spots by Shell-shock is given\r\nclear illustration, as in the case of Shell-shock recurrence of an\r\nold syphilitic hemiplegia (Case 28). Only on such a basis could the\r\nsyphilitic ocular palsy of Case 19 be satisfactorily explained.\r\n\r\n=25.= =The coexistence of functional phenomena with organic syphilitic\r\nphenomena is demonstrated= by Cases 29 and 30; perhaps also in Case 16.\r\n\r\n=26.= It must be said that presumably there will be, unless our\r\nauthorities are more successful than in the past, a considerable\r\nincrease in venereal disease as the result of army life in wartime.\r\nThere will be a certain number of cases of neurosyphilis a number of\r\nyears after discharge from the army caused by infection acquired during\r\nservice. (Germany is said to have got its crop of neurosyphilis after\r\nthe War of 1870, in the early eighties of the last century.) The names\r\nof all soldiers acquiring syphilis and not considered cured at the\r\ntime of discharge should, under ideal conditions, be given to health\r\norganizations in their home states so that they may be accorded proper\r\ncare and treatment.\r\n\r\n=27.= =Shell-shock and epilepsy.= The authorities have been somewhat\r\nsurprised by the number of epileptics that have gotten by the draft\r\nboards. The statistics are not yet ripe, but certainly the enlistment\r\nof an epileptic is not a rarity. There are some singular instances\r\nin the war literature showing how hard it sometimes is to bring\r\nout epilepsy. There is the English case, for example, of a man, an\r\nepileptic’s son, who had himself been epileptic from 11-18, who\r\nentered the Expeditionary Force at the outbreak of hostilities, went\r\nthrough the retreat from Mons and through two years of active warfare\r\nwithout having a single epileptic convulsion. In fact, in September,\r\n1916, he was put in charge of eight men on guard duty. Apparently the\r\nnew responsibilities worried him, and two months later he had become\r\nepileptic to the extent of petit mal.\r\n\r\nAnother man who had never been epileptic (though his sisters had been)\r\nwas wounded four times, was never worried by shell fire, got somewhat\r\ndepressed after the death of his father and five brothers in the\r\nservice, but did not become epileptic until finally he was blown up and\r\nburied three times in one day, and it was a whole month later when he\r\nbecame epileptic, although treatment by rest and bromides apparently\r\nresolved the affair.\r\n\r\nOther cases seem to show that war experiences can bring out epilepsy,\r\nalthough in most instances it would appear that there was an epileptic\r\nor otherwise neuropathic heredity in these cases.\r\n\r\n=28.= There is one author, Ballard, who has actually propounded a\r\n=theory of Shell-shock as epileptic=, pointing out the occurrence\r\nof epilepsy long after the early symptoms of Shell-shock have\r\ndisappeared.[10] There does not appear to have been any increase in\r\nepileptics as the result of the war, either from the standpoint of\r\nShell-shock or from the standpoint of brain injury, so far as the\r\nrecords of the National Hospital for the Paralyzed and Epileptic in\r\nLondon are able to show.\r\n\r\n    [10] In one instance, fugue and other minor symptoms were\r\n    later replaced by epilepsy; in another, an epileptic confusion\r\n    developed eight months after an explosion, and in a third,\r\n    a case of mine explosion, stammering resolved into mutism\r\n    and mutism finally into epilepsy. Of course there is a\r\n    so-called general resemblance among all forms of hyperkinesis\r\n    or irritative discharge of the nervous system. If we term\r\n    epileptic all the things that various authors have termed\r\n    epileptoid, we may be doing nothing more than to say that we\r\n    believe these cases all subject to epileptic hyperkinesis.\r\n    In that direction, of course, it has long been said that\r\n    dipsomania was really a form of epilepsy. Whether Shell-shock\r\n    is ordinarily subject to recurrence in such wise as to imitate\r\n    the recurrence of attacks of dipsomania, of manic-depressive\r\n    psychosis or of epilepsy, is, to say the least, doubtful at\r\n    this time.\r\n\r\n=29.= As in all other instances of mental or nervous disease, when an\r\n=epileptic returns from the war=, whether or not he was potentially or\r\nactually an epileptic before the war, his relatives are bound to term\r\nhim a case of =Shell-shock=. I am familiar with a case in a hospital\r\nin a certain Atlantic port, a case of pronounced and obvious epilepsy.\r\nIn the wards he is treated as the hero of every occasion. Not only the\r\nnurses and attendants, but the other patients and often the physicians\r\ncan hardly resist thinking of him as somehow a case of Shell-shock. It\r\nis a comment upon the status of mental hygiene in general that this\r\nself-same epileptic, had there been no war, would have been, as it\r\nwere, a common or garden epileptic, mute and inglorious on some sunny\r\nhillside.\r\n\r\n=30.= In passing I may note how many instances in the medicolegal\r\npart of the war literature there are of =epileptics who come up for\r\ncourtmartial= or for medical examination pending courtmartial. We may\r\nsuspect that many a case of epileptic fugue has been regarded as a\r\ncase of desertion. There is the case of an epileptic who left camp one\r\nmorning and got drunk. Investigation showed that he left camp before\r\nanything epileptoid had happened. He developed in his drunkenness a\r\npretty clearly epileptic crisis with great violence, for which he had\r\na complete loss of memory. The French Council condemned him to five\r\nyears of labor, not admitting in this instance that responsibility was\r\ndiminished by reason of the man’s being epileptic. In short, from the\r\nmilitary point of view, he should, so to say, have known enough not to\r\nhave gotten drunk, and so have avoided getting his epileptic crisis. Of\r\ncourse the decision was here very close, and a like decision would not\r\nalways be rendered. To add to the complication of this particular case,\r\nthe very first epileptoid crisis which caused it to be known that the\r\nman fell into the epileptic group was due to Shell-shock, or at least\r\ndeveloped immediately after the bursting of a shell nearby. On the\r\nwhole, however, the relation between epilepsy and Shell-shock is not a\r\nclose one.\r\n\r\n=31.= =The question of epilepsy in the war= is considered in a series\r\nof 33 cases (Cases 53-85). The considerations range from banal cases\r\ndeveloping quite incidentally, up to cases regarded by one author\r\n(Ballard) as illustrating a theory of Shell-shock as epileptic (Cases\r\n82-84). First are considered two cases actually syphilitic. In the\r\nfirst (Case 53), the diagnosis had to be revised from epilepsy to\r\nneurosyphilis (the convulsions of this neurosyphilitic were brought\r\nout by alcohol, and the reporter, Hewat, remarks that the serum of any\r\npatient developing epileptiform seizures between 35 and 50 years of age\r\nshould be subject to test). In Case 54, the soldier got his syphilis\r\nin wartime and the syphilis acted to bring out an epilepsy with which\r\nthe patient was hereditarily tainted (epilepsy syphilogenic, _i.e._,\r\nreactive to syphilis).\r\n\r\nCase 55 might perhaps better have been considered in the group of\r\nhypophrenoses, as he was epileptic and imbecile. He was at first\r\ncondemned by court martial to five years’ imprisonment for leaving his\r\npost in the presence of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAnother mixed case is Case 57, in which another feeble-minded subject\r\nshowed seizures of a psychogenic nature, which he was able eventually\r\nto stop by clenching his teeth.\r\n\r\nSeven cases (Cases 58-64) are cases of a disciplinary nature, amongst\r\nwhich attention may be called to Case 62, the “specialist in escapes.”\r\nThe medicolegal questions of responsibility in the drunken epileptic\r\n(Case 58) are particularly perplexing.\r\n\r\n=32.= Case 64 is one of =epilepsy following antityphoid inoculation\r\none-half hour=. There were five attacks during a fortnight and then\r\nno others. The antityphoid inoculation came eight weeks after a shell\r\nwound of the thigh, which had not served to bring out the epilepsy in\r\nthis patient. Bonhoeffer had three other instances of the sort: one in\r\na severely tainted subject, and the others in alcoholics.\r\n\r\n=33.= The next group of cases, 66-77, yields a series of the most\r\ninteresting =medical problems=, some of which scarcely belong in\r\nan account of psychoses incidental in the war. Case 66 is one with\r\nrecovery from Jacksonian seizures after decompression of the upper\r\nRolandic region, which was edematous following an (apparently very\r\nslight) scalp wound and shell-shock.\r\n\r\n=34.= The cure by studied neglect (in Case 67) is one of\r\n=hystero-epileptic= convulsions occurring in series. Case 68\r\ndemonstrates the superposition of hysterica phenomena over a genuine\r\nepilepsy, a case therefore with two diagnoses: not hystero-epilepsy,\r\nbut epilepsy =and= hysteria.\r\n\r\n=35.= The theoretical implications of Case 69 are striking: The\r\ncase was one of musculo-cutaneous neuritis (gross enlargement), in\r\nassociation with which =Brown-Séquard’s epilepsy= developed, waxing\r\nand waning with the disease of the nerve. Another case of possible\r\nreactive epilepsy is Case 70, and a case of epilepsia tarda brings up\r\nthe same issue (Case 71). Cases 72-74 are cases with strong psychogenic\r\ncomponents, of which Case 74 is particularly instructive on account of\r\nthe gradual building up of a remarkable visual aura of an approaching\r\nfire-wheel, this aura developing after scotoma from looking at the sun.\r\nCases 75 and 76 are cases of somewhat doubtful epilepsy, one of fugue\r\nand the other of a solitary epileptic episode following 38 artillery\r\nbattles in two months.\r\n\r\n=36.= Friedmann discusses =narcoleptic seizures=, regarded as due to\r\nthe =brain fag of trench life= (Case 77). Sham fits and epileptoid\r\nattacks controllable by will appear in Cases 78 and 79 respectively.\r\nCase 80 is a striking case of a man with epileptic taint, which two\r\nyears’ service, four wounds, the death of a father and five brothers,\r\nand eventually Shell-shock and burial thrice in one day, served at last\r\nto bring out.\r\n\r\n=37.= =Shell-shock and bodily disease.= In civilian psychopathic\r\nhospital practice, if a case is not syphilitic, not feeble-minded, not\r\nepileptic, not alcoholic, and without signs of intracranial pressure or\r\ndisorder of reflexes, then we, as specialists, must consider whether\r\nthe disease in question is not due to some form of bodily disorder\r\noutside the nervous system; for example, we think in practice of\r\ninfectious psychoses, of exhaustive states such as the puerperium,\r\nof toxic states such as may be found in cardiorenal cases, and of\r\nglandular phenomena such as we are familiar with in the thyroid\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nUnder the war conditions, it might be thought that these somatic\r\ndisorders yielding the so-called symptomatic mental diseases would be\r\nfrequently found.\r\n\r\nAside from these rarities in puzzling diagnosis, we find more commonly\r\nin the literature evidence of\r\n\r\n=38.= =The soldier’s heart, the so-called “D.A.H.,”= or disordered\r\naction of the heart, of the English army reports. This soldier’s\r\nheart is sometimes associated with hyperthyroidism, and sometimes\r\nhyperthyroidism is found alone, with symptoms suggesting those of a\r\nsort of diffuse Shell-shock.\r\n\r\nOne author claims rapid cures of hyperthyroidism by the relatively\r\nsimple process of hypnosis. Perhaps this is not too unlikely in view\r\nof the still obscure relations between mind and hormones. A little\r\nmore surprising, perhaps, is the assertion met with that psoriasis is\r\nsometimes a Shell-shock phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe literature clearly shows, however, that, as in most special\r\nproblems, the internist is still in demand. I recall how one internist\r\nwas misled on the witness stand into stating that he was a “general\r\nspecialist.” This is what we would all need to be, were we to solve the\r\nproblems of Shell-shock in the time allotted to us by the war.\r\n\r\n=39.= Following are =special cases= to show how near the somatic\r\n(“symptomatic”) may be to Shell-shock.\r\n\r\nThe somatic group of psychoses, sometimes termed symptomatic, is\r\nillustrated in 29 cases (Cases 118-146), and comprises cases ranging\r\nall the way from rabic phenomena to those of hyperthyroidism. Possibly\r\nthe first two cases (Cases 118 and 119) might better be placed among\r\nthe encephalopsychoses. Case 118, one of _rabies_, was that of a farmer\r\nwithout history of having been bitten by a dog, who eventually came\r\nto autopsy and received the Pasteur Institute diagnosis of rabies. A\r\ndiagnosis of angina was at first made. When the symptoms became more\r\nserious and masseter spasm developed, a question of tetanus arose.\r\nLater the diagnosis of meningitis was suggested. At this point, the\r\nsymptoms became predominantly psychotic.\r\n\r\nCase 119 was one of seven cases reported by Lumière and Astier, in\r\nwhich delirium and hallucinations appeared as a complication of\r\n_tetanus_. The case in question had been given anti-tetanic serum.\r\n(Another case showed identical symptoms without having been given\r\nanti-tetanic serum.)\r\n\r\nThat a local tetanus could be mistaken for hysteria might seem _à\r\npriori_ unlikely, but Cases 120 and 121 indicate as much; and Case\r\n121 is interesting on account of the officer’s own description of his\r\nlocal tetanus and its treatment. A psychosis apparently related with\r\ndysentery occurred in Case 122. Hysteria followed typhoid fever in Case\r\n123. Another form of typhoid fever complication is perhaps shown in\r\nCase 124, wherein the diagnostic question lay between dementia praecox\r\nand a post-typhoid encephalitis.\r\n\r\n_Paratyphoid fever_ has diagnostic complications, as shown in Cases 125\r\nand 126, wherein the mental symptoms outlasted the fever (Case 125),\r\nand psychopathic taint was brought out (Case 126).\r\n\r\n_Diphtheria_ was also represented in the matter of nervous and mental\r\nsymptoms in Cases 127 and 128. In Case 127 the nervous symptoms\r\nappeared eight days after evacuation for diphtheria. There were a few\r\nsensory symptoms (hypalgesia, hypoacusia, and peculiar bone sensations)\r\nin this subject. The phenomenon in Case 128 was apparently one of\r\nhysterical paraparesis; nor does it appear in this case that the\r\nhysterical paralysis was preceded by polyneuritis.\r\n\r\n_Malarial effects_ are present in three cases (Cases 129-131), of\r\nwhich Case 129 showed an amnesia, Case 130 a Korsakow syndrome, and\r\nCase 131 anterior horn symptoms. Case 132 exemplifies 15 instances of\r\nacroparesthetic disorders in so-called trench foot. This case, like\r\nseveral others, is inserted in this group, not because the symptoms\r\nare psychotic, but because they might cause diagnostic difficulty as\r\nagainst hysterical phenomena.\r\n\r\nCase 133 is an autopsied case of bronchopneumonia following bullet\r\ninjury of the spine. Microscopic examination of the spinal cord\r\nshowed small cavities in the first and fourth dorsal segments. This\r\nmyelomalacia was doubtless related with the bullet injury of the\r\nspine, although the spinal cord was not itself directly touched by\r\nthe bullet. Case 134 might be regarded perhaps as one of Shell-shock\r\nand should be considered in relation with the cases at the head of\r\nSection B (Cases 197-209). The case might be regarded as functional,\r\nexcept for a decubitus that developed. Despite this decubitus, there\r\nwas recovery. The case is placed in the somatic group on account of\r\n_pulmonary phenomena_ which it seemed well to relate with those of Case\r\n133. Compare also Case 136, in which reflex phenomena are associated\r\nwith a bullet wound of the pleura. Case 135 is a many-sided case,\r\nwith ante-bellum hysteria and certain Shell-shock phenomena. While\r\nunder observation, the patient caught typhoid fever and then developed\r\nneuritis. This neuritis was very probably not post-typhoidal so much as\r\nhysterical. Accordingly, the case should be considered in connection\r\nwith the ante-bellum weak spot series, Section B (Cases 286-301). There\r\nwas in this case a cure by reëducation.\r\n\r\nThe reflex hemiplegia with double ulnar syndrome in Case 136 seemed to\r\nhave followed a bullet _wound of the pleura_. According to the authors,\r\nPhocas and Gutmann, there is considerable literature upon nerve\r\ncomplications of pleura trauma, including syncope, epilepsy, and (more\r\nrarely) hemiplegia.\r\n\r\n_Heart cases_ are illustrated by Cases 137-139: the first one of\r\nhysterical tachypnoea, and the others of the so-called soldiers’ heart.\r\n\r\n_Diabetes mellitus_ seems to have followed war strain and shell wound\r\nin Case 140.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether shell-shock and burial had anything to do with\r\nthe appearance ten days later of _lipomata_, which proved to be the\r\ninitial phenomenon in a pronounced Dercum’s disease. (Case 141).\r\n\r\n_Hyperthyroidism_ is illustrated in four cases (Cases 142-144).\r\nThe first (Case 142) appears to have been cured by inducing deep\r\nsomnambulism (Tombleson claims cures by suggestion in eight cases of\r\nhyperthyroidism). Neurasthenia or questionable Graves’ disease (Case\r\n145) followed Shell-shock. That of Case 144 followed 10 months’\r\nservice, at times under protracted shell fire. A _forme fruste_ of\r\nGraves’ disease is shown in Case 145, in which the phenomena followed\r\ngassing and shelling.\r\n\r\nA somewhat curious _somatic complication_ in a case of Shell-shock\r\nhysteria was the finding of a needle in the left upper arm, which was\r\nthen extracted. (Case 146).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF WAR NEUROSES\r\n\r\n=40.= Regarding our rough delimitation of the Shell-shock group as\r\nwell in hand, having put upon one side three of the most disturbing\r\ngroups (save one) in our process of demarcation, =we must proceed to\r\nthe Shell-shock material itself: a material now definable as assuredly\r\nnon-syphilitic, non-epileptic, non-somatic=,[11] as beyond question\r\nwithout narrow relations with feeble-mindedness, alcohol and drug\r\nstates, schizophrenia and cyclothymia, and =as probably of the general\r\nnature of the psychoneuroses=.\r\n\r\n    [11] In the limited _non-encephalic_ sense of the term somatic\r\n    (“symptomatic”) of some writers.\r\n\r\nNote that in this epicrisis I have designedly not followed the order\r\nof presentation of the text materials. The process of _diagnosis per\r\nexclusionem in ordine_ which I find most serviceable in civilian\r\npsychopathic hospital practice is the elimination of possibilities in\r\nthe order presented in Chart 1 or in Paragraph 10 of this epicrisis.\r\nBecause this book will find its greatest use in peace times as a\r\nkind of illustrative commentary on the peace material that presents\r\nitself in general practice or in psychopathic hospital voluntary,\r\ntemporary-care, and out-patient practice, I chose to arrange the\r\ndelimiting material according to the order of the practical key devised\r\nfor civilian practice. We may now profitably change our order of\r\nconsideration and consider whether\r\n\r\n=41.= =The most practical key or sequence of consideration in the\r\nendeavor to delimit Shell-shock neuroses is probably: Exclude (1)\r\nsyphilis, (2) epilepsy, (3) somatic disease= (of a sort able to produce\r\n“symptomatic” effects somewhat like those of Shell-shock).\r\n\r\nBelow I shall still permit myself some general words concerning\r\nthe other more easily excluded groups because of the light which\r\nfeeble-mindedness, alcoholism, schizophrenia, cyclothymia, and even old\r\nage can theoretically throw on the nature of Shell-shock.\r\n\r\n=42.= Suppose then that syphilis, epilepsy, and somatic (non-nervous)\r\ndisease are out of the running, =we come practically down to the\r\npsychoneuroses=, knowing that knotty problems are at hand in telling\r\nthem from structural traumatic effects: =But, after all, what are\r\nfunctional neuroses?= What do we really know about the neuroses other\r\nthan to say that they are _not_ distinguished by the existence of the\r\nstructural lesions which characterize organic disease of the nervous\r\nsystem? Is not the definition of neurosis purely by negatives? However\r\ntrue this definition by negatives may be from the genetic and general\r\npathological viewpoint, the work of Charcot and in particular of\r\nBabinski has yielded a number of positive features from the clinical\r\nviewpoint, which to some degree make up for the lack of anything\r\npositive in the neurones themselves as studied post-mortem. An eminent\r\nGerman has recently declared that the data of this war itself go far to\r\nprove some of the long dubious contentions of the Frenchman, Charcot;\r\nand the work of Babinski during the war has strengthened and developed\r\nthe conceptions of his master, Charcot, as well as the ante-bellum\r\nconceptions of Babinski himself.\r\n\r\n=43.= Let me insist that =the problem is practical enough: Organic\r\nversus functional neurosis=. The point I want to make is that, when so\r\nmuch theoretical doubt concerning organic and functional neuropathy\r\nholds sway, the practical doubts in the individual case under the\r\nvarying conditions of civilian practice and in the upheavals of\r\nmilitary practice, must be still more in evidence. Case after case\r\ndescribed in the literature of every belligerent has passed from\r\npillar to post and from post to pillar before diagnostic resolution\r\nand therapeutic success. Colleagues meeting, for example, at the Paris\r\nNeurological Society, find themselves reporting the same case from\r\ndifferent standpoints,--the one announcing a semi-miraculous cure of\r\na case which another had months before claimed only as a diagnostic\r\ncuriosity. In the midst of such discussions and controversies, there\r\nmust inevitably be a renaissance in neurology.\r\n\r\n=44.= =In cases of alleged Shell-shock, the hypothesis of focal\r\nstructural damage to the nervous system or its membranes has to be\r\nraised.=\r\n\r\nShell bursts and other detonations can produce =hemorrhage in the\r\nnervous system and in various organs without external injury=. Thus a\r\nman died from having both his lungs burst from the effects of a shell\r\nexploding a meter away. Hemorrhage into the urinary bladder has been\r\nidentically produced. Lumbar puncture yields blood in sundry cases of\r\nshell explosion without external wound, and Babinski has a case of\r\nhematomyelia produced while the victim was lying down, so that the\r\nfactor of direct violence through fall can be excluded. In sundry\r\ncases, not only blood but also lymphocytes have been found, sometimes\r\nin a hypertensive puncture fluid.\r\n\r\n=45.= Moreover, =in cases of alleged Shell-shock there may be a\r\ncombination of structural and functional disease=.\r\n\r\nA herpes or the graying-out of hair overnight can suggest organic\r\nchanges. A case may combine lost knee-jerks (suggesting organic\r\ndisease) with urinary retention (suggesting functional disorder).\r\n\r\n=46.= Again, =there is a group of war neuroses=, especially clearly\r\nbrought out in cases of ear injury, =in which the functional disorder\r\nsurrounds the organic as a nucleus=. But these “periorganic” neuroses\r\nare no proof that the neuroses in question are organic in nature.\r\nHysterical anesthesia, paralysis, or contracture may occur on the\r\nside of the body which has received a wound: =the process of such a\r\nperitraumatic disorder is, nevertheless, a functional process=.\r\n\r\n=47.= But, when the problem is statistically taken, =the majority\r\nof cases of alleged Shell-shock without external wound prove to be\r\nfunctional, as indicated by their clinical pictures=. Thus, after\r\na mine explosion, a man was hemiplegic, tremulous and mute. After\r\nsundry vicissitudes, the tremors were hypnotized away. Then the mutism\r\nvanished, to be supplanted by stuttering. Finally the hemiplegia\r\nremained. So far as the mutism and the tremors went, this man might\r\nbelong in the =majority group of Shell-shock cases, namely, the\r\nfunctional group=. Assuming the hemiplegia to be really organic, we\r\nshould regard this man as a mixed case, organic and functional.\r\n\r\n=48.= =But do we not know all= we need to know or all we are likely\r\nto know =about the neuroses already= from old civilian studies? There\r\nare some cases without very close relations to the war: Thus, we\r\nconceive of (_a_) psychoneuroses incidental to the war and such that\r\nthey might very probably have developed without the entrance of war\r\nfactors; and on the other hand, we conceive of (_b_) psychoneuroses\r\n(to be dealt with _in extenso_ later) in which war factors (either\r\nphysical Shell-shock or other factors) forcibly enter. There are in\r\nthis group of incidental psychoneuroses 12 cases. The first, described\r\nas a constitutional _intimiste_, a psychasthenic _en herbe_, was one\r\nin which a hallucination was developed in the field, and in which\r\nthree phases of a psychopathic nature--(_a_) over-emotionality, (_b_)\r\nobsessions, (_c_) loss of feeling of reality--developed. In this case\r\nthe war work at first seemed to better the man’s general condition,\r\nand he gave two years of effective service. This officer in effect\r\n=invented his own Shell-shock equivalent= in a hallucination of Germans\r\nappearing in his trench. The case may be compared with one described in\r\nSection B, namely, Case 347: that of a Russian soldier who developed\r\nperfectly characteristic war dreams, though his entire service had been\r\nrendered in the rear and he had not had experiences in action.\r\n\r\nPossibly Case 171, that of _hysterical fugue_, might be regarded as one\r\nof Shell-shock, since two shells burst near him prior to his fugue. The\r\nman had had analogous crises, certified by Régis, in adolescence, and\r\nhad received the diagnosis hysteria. In this instance, we are dealing\r\nmerely with an habitual somnambulist who has a characteristic fugue\r\nfollowing explosion of two shells. The war is in a sense responsible\r\nfor the fugue, yet not directly, and the fugue would, without the\r\nstress and strain of war, probably never have developed (see sundry\r\ncases in the group in which ante-bellum phenomena are newly evoked in\r\nwar: Cases 286-301).\r\n\r\nThe hysterical psychosis of an Adventist (Case 172) might be regarded\r\nas liberated by military service; the terrible fear of the guns shown\r\nby the psychoneurotic (Case 173) proceeded to the point of fugue. A\r\nShell-shock victim whose war bride was pregnant, developed fugue with\r\namnesia and mutism (Case 174). Under hypnosis, it appeared that his\r\nfugue began with his running away from shells. Case 175 was that of a\r\nneurasthenic who volunteered and had to be sent back from the front\r\nafter three months. In this case, war dreams were supplanted by sex\r\ndreams, and the fear of insanity became ingrained. The phenomena here\r\nwere largely ante-bellum and the war brought them out once more, as\r\nmight other disturbing experiences.\r\n\r\nCase 176 is here introduced to show that =neurasthenia may develop in a\r\nman without hereditary taint= or acquired soil. There was a very slight\r\nshrapnel injury of the skull, which somewhat clouds the diagnosis in\r\nthe case. Five months’ war experience brought out the neurasthenia.\r\nCase 177 deals with a point in the diagnosis of psychasthenia, which,\r\naccording to Crouzon, shows arterial hypotension, a condition important\r\nto distinguish from that of pulmonary tuberculosis and of Addison’s\r\ndisease. Compare this case with Case 169: a case of depression treated\r\nby pituitrin. Case 178 is a case of psychasthenia following several\r\nmonths’ service by a man who probably should never have entered\r\nmilitary service.\r\n\r\nAnother case of ante-bellum origin is Case 179. _Antityphoid\r\ninoculation_ appears to have been the initial factor in the case of\r\n_neurasthenia_ No. 180. Compare Case 65, epilepsy after antityphoid\r\ninoculation. Case 181 was that of a non-commissioned reserve German\r\nofficer whose neurasthenia was distinguished by _sympathy with the\r\nenemy_. He did not want to let his men shoot at the enemy because\r\nthe idea came forcibly to him that the enemy soldiers had wives and\r\nchildren. This symptom of sympathy with the enemy was also shown by\r\nanother German (Case 229). Compare the sentiments of a Russian under\r\nnarcosis (Case 555).\r\n\r\nTo sum up concerning the small group of psychoneuroses presented in\r\nthe section on Psychoses Incidental in the War, we are dealing with\r\ncases in which the phenomena are either continuous with ante-bellum\r\nphenomena, or are of such a nature that they might well have been\r\nbrought out by other factors than those of war. These cases by the\r\ndesign of their choice throw little or no light upon the relation of\r\nphysical shell-shock or its equivalent to the psychoneuroses, though\r\nin a few instances the factor of shell explosion is not entirely\r\nto be excluded, and in one instance (Case 170) a hallucination may\r\nbe regarded as a virtual equivalent of an emotional shock of great\r\ncompelling power.\r\n\r\nExamples are available of hysteria (Cases 171, 172, 173, 174), of\r\nneurasthenia (Cases 175, 176, 179, 180, and 181), and of psychasthenia\r\n(Cases 177, 178, and possibly 170).\r\n\r\n=49.= =Let us now contrast with these specified ante-bellum or non-war\r\ncases= the situation which will face us in =the war group=.\r\n\r\nSection B contains 174 cases (Cases 197-370). Autopsied cases (Cases\r\n197-201) are put first and are followed by cases in which lumbar\r\npuncture data are available (Cases 202-207). A third group of cases\r\nis that in which so-called organic symptoms are much in evidence,\r\neither independently or in association with functional symptoms (Cases\r\n208-219). There follows a small group of three cases with shrapnel\r\nwound (Cases 220-222), in which hysterical symptoms were prominent, as\r\nagainst the prevalent and correct conception that wounded cases are not\r\nso prone to psychoneurosis as non-wounded cases. Three cases specially\r\nmarked by tremors (Cases 223-225) follow, the last of which gives the\r\nvictim’s (a French artist) own account of his feelings. The next two\r\ncases (Cases 226 and 227) give respectively a German and a British\r\nsoldier’s account of Shell-shock symptoms.\r\n\r\nThere then follows a great group of =cases= (Cases 228-273) =arranged\r\naccording to the part of the body= chiefly affected by hysterical\r\nsymptoms. The arrangement is one of toe to top, or as one might more\r\ntechnically say, cephalad. This =cephalad arrangement= naturally begins\r\nwith cases with symptoms affecting one leg or foot (Cases 228-235).\r\nThen follow cases of paraplegia (Cases 236-241). As we proceed cephalad\r\nthen follow four cases of the so-called hysterical bent back, or\r\ncamptocormia (Souques). Then come walking disorders (Cases 246-248).\r\nStill proceeding cephalad, disorders of one arm and hand are considered\r\nin a series of six cases (Cases 249-254). Bilateral phenomena,\r\nsymmetrical or asymmetrical, follow in Cases 255-258. Now reaching the\r\nhead, we deal with cases of deafness (Cases 259-260), of deafmutism\r\n(Cases 261-263), of speech disorder (Cases 264 and 265), with two\r\nspecial cases (Cases 266 and 267). Eye symptoms are dealt with in a\r\nseries of cases (Cases 268-272), and Case 273 deals with cranial nerve\r\ndisorder supposed to be due to shell windage without explosion.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the above arrangement of 46 cases (Cases 228-273) is that\r\nthe reader dealing with cases of hysterical disorder due to physical\r\nshell-shock, or some equivalent thereof, may inspect the data in a few\r\nanalogous cases described more or less fully in the literature. By\r\nreference to the index, the reader will be able to find still further\r\ncases to illustrate the symptom in question.\r\n\r\nThe next series of cases (Cases 274-281) are to illustrate the\r\ncontentions of Babinski concerning the elective exaggeration\r\nof reflexes under chloroform, and the =conception of reflex or\r\nphysiopathic disorders= based thereon--a topic to which return is made\r\nin Section C on Diagnosis, and elsewhere. A small group of cases (Cases\r\n282-285) illustrate the delay of Shell-shock and kindred symptoms in\r\ncertain instances, cases that suggest a refractory period of greater\r\nlength than usual, or the interposition of some unusual factor.\r\n\r\nThe next group of cases (Cases 286-301) is of special note, bringing\r\nout what is discussed below, namely, =the emphasis, reminiscence,\r\nor repetition of antebellum phenomena=, and the picking out of weak\r\nspots in the organism by Shell-shock. Possibly Cases 302-303 belong\r\nin the same group of illustrations of the driving in of ante-bellum\r\neffects. Cases 304 and 305 are definitively cases in which hereditary\r\ninstability is a factor, whereas Cases 306 and 307 form a foil to\r\nthese, in that the phenomena develop in subjects confidently stated to\r\nbe without hereditary or acquired psychopathic tendency.\r\n\r\nThe next series of cases (Cases 308-320) shows =peculiar phenomena=;\r\n_e.g._, monocular diplopia, shell-shock psoriasis, synesthesia,\r\npuerilism, and the like. Shell-shock equivalents of various sorts are\r\nplaced in a group of cases (Cases 321-325). The next series of cases\r\n(Cases 326 to the end of this Section: 370) show tendencies to general\r\nneurasthenic, psychasthenic, and other psychopathic phenomena, rather\r\nthan the more definite phenomena discussed in the early part of this\r\nsection in the series arranged “cephalad.”\r\n\r\n=50.= Rehearsing more briefly these findings, what is the nature of\r\nthese disorders? The literature is practically unanimous on the point:\r\n=We have to do merely with the classical problem of the neuroses=, and\r\nwhen all the data are some day united, we shall doubtless know a great\r\ndeal more about the neuroses.\r\n\r\n=51.= =Locus minoris resistentiae.= That the process, whatever else\r\nit does, is rather apt to pick out pre-existent weak spots in the\r\npatient (the habitual gastropath becoming subject to vomiting; the old\r\nstammerer stammering once more or even becoming mute; the man always\r\n“hit in the legs” by exertion, now becoming paraplegic) is obvious.\r\nThe striking instances in which an old cured syphilitic monoplegia, or\r\nan old hysterical hemichorea, comes back under the influence of shell\r\nexplosion in precisely the limits and with precisely the appearance of\r\nthe former disease, indicate how various a factor may be the =locus\r\nminoris resistentiae=.\r\n\r\n=52.= But, =without= weak spot, =without= acquired soil, =without=\r\nheredity, we must now erect the hypothesis that, =the classical\r\nneuroses may= in some, though certainly a minority of cases, =afflict\r\nnormal men=. Under the war conditions of investigation touching the\r\nfamily and personal histories of the men, perhaps we should not be too\r\nsure of this hypothesis; but the army records will after the war allow\r\nus to make or break the point forever and thereby throw the clearest\r\nlight upon the vexing problems of industrial medicine, wherein progress\r\nin general has been so slow on account of the partisanship of the\r\ncorporation and plaintiff’s attorneys.\r\n\r\n=53.= =Purely psychogenic war cases exist=: Though Shell-shock denotes,\r\nto say the least, _shocks_ and _shells_--yet we know Shell-shock _sans_\r\nany shock and _sans_ any shell, nay _sans_ either shell or shock.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a soldier may get war dreams though he has never been in\r\nthe fighting zone and never by any chance observed the circumstance of\r\nwar, or the fact that a man can become mute on the second day after\r\na shell explosion because the night before he had dreamed of some\r\nhysterically mute patients in his ward--these facts again, although\r\nthey argue a psychogenic origin for the phenomena of so-called\r\n“Shell-shock,” do not at all mean that actual physical explosion in\r\nother cases may not be tremendously important.\r\n\r\n=54.= This is shown by the exceedingly interesting phenomena of\r\n=localization or determination of symptoms= to a given region under\r\nthe special local influence of the explosion. Thus, in the schematic\r\ncase, an explosion to the left of the soldier produces anesthesia and\r\nparalysis on the left or exposed side. Now and again a case will show\r\nsuch anesthetic and paralytic phenomena upon the side exposed to the\r\nexplosion and some hypertonic, irritative phenomena upon the other\r\nside. One gets the figure in one’s mind of an organism fixed, immobile\r\nand numb, on the spot by the explosion--and the other half of the body,\r\nas it were, attempting to run away from the situation. One side of the\r\nbody, as it were, plays ’possum, the other tends to flight.\r\n\r\n=55.= Of course these physical phenomena should not blind us to the\r\nemotional ones. Now and then the multiple causes of a case may be\r\nanalyzed, as, for example, one of blindness in which a =series of\r\nfactors= emerged, such as =excitement, blinding flashes, fear, disgust\r\nand fatigue=. I cannot here go further into these details, and I\r\nneed no longer insist upon the fact that =surrounding the problem\r\nof Shell-shock means surrounding the problem of nervous and mental\r\ndiseases= as a whole, and that thus to be a Shell-shock analyst means\r\nto be a neuropsychiatrist.\r\n\r\n=56.= The organic problems of the nervous system are brought up\r\nconstantly in differential diagnosis, but the functional problems\r\ndivide themselves up in a perturbing manner into a fraction properly\r\ntermed the “psychopathic” (that is, after the manner of hysteria), and\r\n“non-psychopathic” (that is, after the manner of reflex disorders of\r\nCharcot, newly named “physiopathic” by Babinski).\r\n\r\n=57.= For the moment we are not discussing differential diagnosis,\r\nbut are merely trying to circumscribe the features we wish to call\r\n=Shell-shock features: We have concluded to call them functional--but\r\nwhat is it to be functional?=\r\n\r\nToo simple is the reply:\r\n\r\n                       FUNCTIONAL = NON-ORGANIC.\r\n\r\nInaccurate and misleading is the reply\r\n\r\n                         FUNCTIONAL = PSYCHIC.\r\n\r\nWe may more correctly express the situation, pathologically speaking,\r\nin the following categories (see chart, page 870):\r\n\r\n    ORGANOPATHIC (Lesional, destructive):\r\n\r\n    (_a_) gross, or (_b_) microscopic, or perhaps (_c_) chemical.\r\n\r\n    DYNAMOPATHIC (functional, irritative, inhibitory,--but\r\n    reversible _ad originem_):\r\n\r\n    (_a_) psychopathic; (_b_) physiopathic (“reflex”).\r\n\r\n=58.= As to the high psychic functions, we had thought of them as\r\nsplit in hysteria, in dissociation of personality. And we had roughly\r\ndistinguished these conditions as =psychopathic= from conditions we\r\ncalled =neuropathic=, regarding the latter neuropathic disorders as on\r\nthe model of the effects of cutting off or destroying certain necessary\r\nneurons. However clear or unclear we were as to the nature of the\r\nneuropathic, it does not here matter. Babinski’s point is that there is\r\nanother kind of dynamic disease that operates, not after the manner of\r\nhysteria, but after a manner reminding one of the forgotten “reflex”\r\ndisorders of Charcot--disorders that fitted the textbooks so poorly\r\nthat the textbooks dropped them out. In short, what you might call\r\n=the dynamopathic or functional in nervous disease has been shown to\r\nfall into two parts=--a =psychopathic= fraction and a non-psychopathic\r\nfraction. Babinski calls this non-psychopathic fraction =physiopathic=\r\nor reflex. And these reflex or physiopathic disorders have a different\r\norder of curability from that of hysterical or psychopathic disorders.\r\nBy what simple device did Babinski prove this? By chloroforming the\r\npatient. Under chloroform, when all the other reflexes were stilled,\r\nBabinski could bring out, in relief as it were, certain reflexes, or\r\neven hypertonuses, that were in the waking life wholly concealed,--yet\r\nat the same time consciousness, in the usual sense of that term, had\r\nvanished. Accordingly, the proof of a new type of functional disease,\r\nat times concealed by the overlay of higher neurones, was now plain.\r\nDoes not this offer new leads of the greatest value in that most\r\nintricate of fields, psychopathology? Is not the model here offered of\r\ndiseased =nervous functions=, =non-psychic= in nature (in the ordinary\r\nsense of psychic) =but of almost equally complex nature=:\r\n\r\nWhoever wins the great war from the military point of view, there\r\ncan be no doubt as to what writers contributed most from the war\r\ndata concerning the doctrine of hysteria, especially concerning the\r\ntheoretical delimitation of hysteria from other forms of functional\r\nnervous disease: There can be no other answer than that, in theoretical\r\nneurology at least, the French have already won the war, if only by\r\nmeans of the remarkable concept set up by Babinski of the so-called\r\n_physiopathic_ (that is, non-neuropathic and non-psychopathic).\r\n\r\nBut how has this splitting of functional neuroses into psychopathic\r\nand physiopathic been rendered certain? By the tremendous modern\r\nsharpening of differential diagnosis dating from, _e.g._, the discovery\r\nof the Babinski reflex. This brings us to the brink of considerations\r\nconcerning the differential diagnostic problem.\r\n\r\nFirst it may be well to regard the whole problem in the light of those\r\nmental diseases that we slid over when we were delimiting Shell-shock\r\nas against syphilis, epilepsy and somatic disease.\r\n\r\n=59.= =Why do some authors think of Shell-shock as an “officer’s\r\ndisease”?= It is clear that they cannot be thinking so much of the\r\nphysiopathic cases as of the psychopathic ones. But psychopathic\r\nconditions are obviously more readily brought about in complex and\r\nlabile apparatus. This point comes out strongly in relation with\r\nthe =comparative stability of the feeble-minded=, at least of most\r\nfeeble-minded, that get into war relations.\r\n\r\nThe possible relations of Shell-shock to feeble-mindedness are of some\r\ninterest. We know that Shell-shock picks out certain nervous and\r\nmental weaklings and indeed that one author claims as high a percentage\r\nas 74 for war neuroses having a hereditary or acquired neuropathic\r\nbasis. How far does feeble-mindedness itself count among these\r\nsupposedly susceptible nervous and mental weaklings? Is a feeble-minded\r\nperson especially in condition for Shell-shock?\r\n\r\nThere are rumors of experiments to show that if in an aquarium\r\ncontaining some jelly fish alongside bony fishes, you explode a\r\nsubstance, the jelly fish ride through unscathed whereas the bony\r\nfishes are killed by the shock. The jelly fish presumably had too\r\nsimple an organization.\r\n\r\nThere is something to be said for the idea that in man also the higher\r\nand more complex specimens are more susceptible to Shell-shock,\r\nthat is, to the neuroses of war, than are the lower and more simple\r\ncombatants. Some statistics indicate that officers, who are in the main\r\nof a higher and more complex organization than the private soldiers,\r\nare much more susceptible than are private soldiers to the neuroses of\r\nwar. Doubtless we shall not be able to verify these statistics until\r\nlong after the war and, so far as I know, no very inclusive statistics\r\nhave been presented.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I judge from the case history literature that the\r\nfeeble-minded, unless they be of that very high level sometimes called\r\nsubnormal, are not particularly susceptible to the neuroses. It is\r\nobvious that idiots and, for the most part, imbeciles, do not get\r\ninto military service. As for what the English term the feeble-minded\r\nor what we in America are now terming morons, it may well be that\r\nour draft boards do not always exclude. High French authorities have\r\nspecifically determined in certain instances that the high-grade\r\nfeeble-minded would be perfectly suitable for certain branches of the\r\nservice. There is the case, for example, of a sandwich man of Paris\r\nwho somehow got into the French army and was being perpetually sent\r\nto look for the squad’s umbrella and the key to the drill ground, but\r\nsang and swung his gun with joy as he went to the front, and apparently\r\ndid very well there. This man had been a state ward and, as you know,\r\nwell-trained state wards are frequently exceedingly good at elementary\r\nforms of drill.\r\n\r\nThen there is another case of an obvious imbecile who was quite without\r\nany idea of military rank and often got punished for treating his\r\nsuperiors like his comrades and was the butt of his section, but on the\r\nfiring-line remained cool, careless of danger--a magnificent example\r\nto his comrades--at last surrounded and taken prisoner. Here the story\r\nmight have ended and the folly of enlisting imbeciles in the army might\r\nhave seemed perfectly plain, except that our imbecile forthwith escaped\r\nfrom the Germans, swam the Meuse and got back to his regiment!\r\n\r\nHere then are cases in which the slight degree of hypophrenia--it seems\r\nunwise to give it the opprobrious title “feeble-mindedness”--would have\r\nbeen entirely inconsistent with the development of Shell-shock. Such\r\nmen are, perhaps, =too simple to develop neuroses=. On the other hand,\r\nit would appear that certain of the slight degrees of hypophrenia, such\r\nas we might find in so-called subnormal or stupid persons, would prove\r\ncapable of “catching Shell-shock” as it were, and then find themselves\r\nentirely incapable of rationalizing the situation. In short, =there\r\nmay be a group of psychic weaklings, just complex enough to fall into\r\nthe zone of potential neurotics, but just simple enough to render the\r\nprocesses of rationalization= (or what one author terms _autognosis_)\r\n=and of psychotherapy in general entirely unavailing=.\r\n\r\nAfter the war we may be confronted with a number of persons with\r\ntheir edges dulled by the war experiences. One has met even brave\r\nofficers who, after months of furlough, still maintain that they will\r\nnever get back to their normal will and initiative. Whether these\r\n=hypoboulic persons= have not been reduced to subnormality so as to\r\nresemble the slighter degrees of hypophrenia or feeble-mindedness\r\ncan hardly be determined now. They will form =important problems in\r\nmental reconstruction=, for with the best will in the world, the\r\noccupation-therapeutist with all her technic, may be unable to force\r\nor coax the will of such hypoboulics into proper action. Nor will the\r\nordinary environment of home and neighborhood turn the trick properly.\r\nExpert social work in adjustment, both of the returned soldier to\r\nhis environment and of the environment to the returned soldier, may\r\nbe necessary. I speak of this problem here not because these persons\r\nare hypophrenic or feeble-minded in the ordinary sense, but we must\r\nconstantly bear in mind our experience in the teaching of hypophrenics\r\n(both in the schools for the feeble-minded and in the community) when\r\nwe are facing problems of mental reconstruction.\r\n\r\n=60.= As for =alcoholism=, Lépine’s figures bespeak its importance\r\nas a hospital-filler and a good deal of prime interest surrounding\r\nalcoholism has been developed in the war; but on the whole, so far\r\nas I can determine from the war case literature, there is little or\r\nno direct relation between alcoholism and Shell-shock, despite the\r\nfact that in a number of instances alcohol has complicated the issue\r\nand very possibly helped in a general demoralization of the victim.\r\nHowever, the alcoholic amnesias and particularly a few instances of\r\nthe so-called pathological intoxication have exhibited a certain\r\nmedicolegal interest, recalling what was just said above about the\r\nresponsibility of a drunken epileptic. Alcohol remains, I should say,\r\npending exact monographic work upon this topic, purely a contributory\r\nfactor for the war neuroses.\r\n\r\nIt must be that the exigencies of the war have prevented full reports\r\nof alcoholic cases; or perhaps they are regarded as of such every-day\r\noccurrence as not to demand case reports. The alcohol and drug group is\r\nrepresented by 17 cases (Cases 86-102).\r\n\r\nThe so-called pathological intoxication is illustrated in Cases 86\r\nand 87. Case 86 was entirely amnestic for an attack of hallucinations\r\nin which he tried to transfix comrades with a bayonet. Cases 87-97\r\nare cases of disciplinary nature,--the majority from a German writer,\r\nKastan. Case 88 illustrates desertion in alcoholic fugue, and Cases\r\n90-92 are three further cases of desertion in alcoholism.\r\n\r\nCases 94 and 95 give a =partial explanation of some German atrocities=.\r\nAt least, here are cases in which the atrocities, with attempted\r\nmurder and rape, are described more or less fully in transcripts of\r\nmedicolegal reports. Case 98 throws a curious cross-light upon the war,\r\nin that a drunken soldier got an unmerited long leave after paying 100\r\nsous for an injection of petrol in his hand. Cases 99-102 are cases\r\nof morphinism, illustrating the effects of the war upon the fate of\r\nmorphinists.\r\n\r\n=61.= =That war makes nobody go mad= in the asylum or lay sense of\r\nthe term =has been abundantly proved by the data of this war--and\r\nthis conclusion is of value in our medical endeavors to establish a\r\nproper lay conception of the nature of Shell-shock=. Consider first\r\nschizophrenia (dementia praecox).\r\n\r\nThat the causes of dementia præcox, still unknown as they are, lodge\r\nmore in the interior of the body or in special individual reactions\r\nof the victim’s mind, seems to be shown by the phenomena of this war,\r\nsince there seems to be no great number of dementia præcox cases\r\ntherein produced. To be sure, some schizophrenic subjects do get into\r\nthe service, and sometimes their delusions and hallucinations get their\r\ncontent and coloring from the war. Thus a Russian, wounded in the army,\r\ndeveloped delusions concerning currents running from his arm to the\r\nGerman lines and felt that he was, so to say, the Jonah of the Russian\r\nfront, as he could determine shell fire to the spot where he was by the\r\narm currents.\r\n\r\nNow and then a case shows a scientifically beautiful admixture of\r\nordinary dementia præcox phenomena with the effects of shell wound or\r\nshock. A picturesque case from the standpoint of German psychiatric\r\ndiagnosis is one of a soldier who boxed the ear of a kindly sister\r\nwho tried to steer him from a room where the examination of another\r\npatient, a woman, was going on. On the whole, the eminent German\r\npsychiatrist who examined him felt that the case was really one\r\nof psychopathic constitution, as he had shown somewhat similar\r\nirascibility on a slight occasion before. However, much to the\r\nastonishment of all, the patient developed further symptoms. His ego\r\ngot terribly swollen. At last he was fain to utter a denunciation of\r\nthe entire _Junkertum_ and of the Kaiser: he said in fact that he was\r\nan Inhabitant of the World and not of Prussia merely. Over here we\r\nallow such persons to edit newspapers and write books with impunity,\r\nbut the eminent German psychiatrist, before mentioned, was constrained\r\nto alter his diagnosis of this cosmopolite from psychopathic\r\nconstitution to dementia praecox!\r\n\r\nThe group is represented by 16 cases (Cases 147-162).\r\n\r\n=62.= There are four cases (Cases 148-151) of a =disciplinary= nature.\r\nThe first (Case 148) was actually arrested as a spy because he was\r\nmaking drawings near a petroleum tank. Of two cases of desertion, one\r\nwas due to a fugue of catatonic nature (Case 149), and the other (Case\r\n150) was one of desertion with behavior suggesting schizophrenia.\r\nHowever, this man was determined to be responsible for his act,\r\nand condemned to 20 years in prison. This latter case might be\r\nconsidered also in connection with Group III (the epilepsies), Group\r\nIV (the pharmacopsychoses), and possibly Group XI (the unresolved\r\npsychopathias).\r\n\r\nCase 151 was likewise alcoholic and disciplinary: the man went so far\r\nas to keep a cigar in his mouth while the captain was rebuking him\r\nand was, in fact, an old sanatorium case, afflicted with some sort of\r\ndegenerative disease, presumably dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n=63.= That =schizophrenic symptoms may be aggravated by service= is\r\nshown likewise in the case that follows, namely, Case 152, a man\r\nwho had been hearing false voices for some two years, had heard his\r\nown thoughts, and felt his personality changing. The military board\r\ndecided that the mental disease had been aggravated by service. Case\r\n153 might offhand be regarded as a malingerer, as he shot himself\r\nin the hand. Upon military review, a delusional state set in, and\r\nin the course of no very long time a state of schizophrenic apathy.\r\nIn point of fact, however, this man had already been in several\r\nhospitals for previous examination, and had served in the army in\r\nrelatively normal intervals. Case 154 is that of a dementia praecox\r\nwho volunteered for three years in French infantry but forthwith gave\r\nindications of mental deterioration. This case of a dementia praecox\r\nvolunteer may be compared with Case 36: that of a superbrave imbecile\r\nwho swam the Meuse, back from a German prison; with Case 47, that\r\nof the feeble-minded person with an insubordinate desire to remain\r\nat the front; with Case 163, a maniacal volunteer; and Case 175, a\r\nneurasthenic volunteer.\r\n\r\n=64.= =Diagnostic questions= are brought up by Cases 155-166, in the\r\nformer of which Bonhoeffer made at first a diagnosis of some form of\r\npsychogenic disease, possibly hysterical, but had eventually to alter\r\nthe diagnosis to hebephrenia or catatonia. Case 156 was possibly one\r\nof Shell-shock, though the man remained on duty for a month with but\r\none symptom, trembling of the arm. For nine months he showed a variety\r\nof symptoms apparently consistent with the diagnosis hysteria, but\r\nthen developed catatonic and paranoic symptoms clearly warranting the\r\ndiagnosis dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n=65.= Schizophrenia may not only be aggravated by service, but as Case\r\n157 shows, =war experience may have a definite effect upon the content\r\nof hallucinations and delusions=. Thus, a man wounded in the left\r\nshoulder built up the idea of currents running from his left arm to the\r\nGermans, such that if anything were touched by the arm, bombardment of\r\nthe Russians would at once start up. The arm, in short, was charmed.\r\n\r\n=66.= =Psychopathic bravery= is not shown in the feeble-minded\r\nonly: Case 158 is that =of an Iron Cross winner= who, after an\r\nhysterical-looking attack with hallucinatory reminiscences of a Gurkha\r\nwhom he had bayoneted, turned out to be =hebephrenic=. Case 159 might\r\nat first sight have been placed among the encephalopsychoses on account\r\nof the trauma to the occiput, and in fact the mystical hallucinations\r\nshown were of a visual nature (a rainbow-colored bird with the face\r\nof the Holy Virgin). In point of fact, there was probably no causal\r\nrelation between the mystical delusions and the brain injury.\r\n\r\n=67.= Case 156, above mentioned, might perhaps be interpreted as\r\none of =Shell-shock dementia praecox=, but the interval of nine\r\nmonths, though filled with hysterical symptoms, is decidedly long\r\nin which to suppose that shell-shock factors could be in process of\r\ncausing dementia praecox. Cases 160 and 161 are more suspicious. Six\r\nGerman soldiers were killed by a German shell within the zone of\r\nGerman fire, two steps away from the subaltern officer (Case 160),\r\nwho carried on for some hours, made his report duly, but thereafter\r\ndeveloped tremors and lost consciousness. According to Weygandt,\r\nthe case is one suggestive of dementia praecox, but very possibly\r\nshould be regarded as one of psychoneurosis. At all events, it would\r\nbe dangerous to found a doctrine to the effect that dementia praecox\r\ncan be initiated by shell-shock upon such a case as 160. Case 161 is\r\nsimilarly doubtful. There are a number of symptoms in this man (the\r\nsole survivor of an explosion in a blockhouse) consistent with the\r\ndiagnosis Shell-shock, and a number of others which hardly can be given\r\nany other interpretation than that of catatonic dementia praecox. But\r\nthe available medical data do not begin until five months after the\r\nshell explosion. We must conclude here also that no definite evidence\r\nexists that dementia praecox can be initiated by the physical factor\r\nshell-shock. Case 162 is one in which there are shell-shock factors and\r\nfatigue factors in a man who had once ante-bellum shown signs of mental\r\ndisorder, and who developed delusions subsequent to a fugue following\r\nshell-shock. The most one could make of this case would be to say that\r\na latent schizophrenia had been liberated by shell-shock.\r\n\r\n=68.= To sum up concerning the schizophrenias (dementia praecox\r\ngroup), there are =cases of great disciplinary interest= in which\r\nalleged espionage and desertion =turn out actually to be schizophrenic\r\nphenomena=. Again, there are interesting diagnostic problems in the\r\ndifferential diagnosis of hysteria and catatonia. There is evidence\r\nthat experience in the war may be woven into the hallucinatory and\r\ndelusional contents of cases of pre-existent psychosis.\r\n\r\n=69.= As to the important question whether shell-shock can initiate\r\ndementia praecox, the evidence from these reported cases is against\r\nthe hypothesis; but if the query be, whether Shell-shock might not\r\naggravate dementia praecox, it may be stated that =a military board\r\nhas decided that dementia praecox may be aggravated by some forms\r\nof military service. There is no reason to suppose that shell-shock\r\nfactors might not operate in this way.= Cases 152 and 162 will be of\r\nservice in the proof of this contention; and Case 162 seems to be\r\ndefinitely one in which a latent schizophrenia, showing itself in\r\none ante-bellum attack, was liberated once more after shell-shock.\r\nOf course, the plan of this book and the method of choice of its\r\ncases precludes any statistical conclusions of great weight from the\r\nrelative number of cases found in the different groups; and it might\r\nwell happen that psychiatrists would not report cases of an everyday\r\nand commonplace nature which might yet be very frequent. On the whole,\r\nhowever, it would not appear that dementia praecox is at all a frequent\r\nphenomenon in the war.\r\n\r\n=70.= =Nor can the cyclothymias= (manic-depressive psychoses) =be\r\ncharged up to war factors= to any important extent.\r\n\r\nOn account of the somewhat close resemblance between the phenomenon of\r\nmanic-depressive psychosis and what we ordinarily feel ourselves--a\r\nlogical situation reflecting merely the fact that the phenomena of\r\nover-activity (mania) and of under-activity (depression) are merely\r\nquantitative variations from the normal--it might be supposed that\r\nthe war life and its shock and strain would start up the cyclothymias\r\nin some numbers. Why should not a shell explosion start up a mania or\r\nthrow a man into a depression? In point of fact the literature somehow\r\ndoes not agree with this presupposition.\r\n\r\nSome years ago in Massachusetts a brief investigation was made of\r\nthe assigned causes of the successive attacks in a great number of\r\ncyclothymic (manic-depressive) cases, and it was found that each\r\nsuccessive attack progressively had less of the physical in the\r\nprevious history. Something like 45% of all the first attacks had a\r\npretty obvious cause in the soma, such as a kidney disease, a heart\r\ndisease, a puerperal condition and the like, but the second attacks\r\nfailed to show even 20% of such obvious somatic causes, and the third\r\nattacks even less than 10%, and so on.\r\n\r\nNow war conditions and even the shell explosions themselves have\r\napparently not set up any such conditions as those of mania or of\r\ndepression. Most of the instances of cyclothymia are instances of men\r\nwho are cyclothymic before they enter the army. These experiences,\r\nwhen after the war we can sift them all out, may allow us to form\r\nbetter ideas as to the etiology of many of the psychoses, and the great\r\nwar may thus prove a gigantic experimental reagent which will aid in\r\nsolving some of the major problems of mental hygiene.\r\n\r\n=71.= =The cyclothymic or manic-depressive group is represented in\r\nstrikingly few cases=, seven in number (Cases 163-169). One of the\r\nideas in the literature concerning the manic-depressive group has\r\nbeen that it is very possibly remotely allied to Graves’ disease,\r\na hypothesis upheld by Stransky in Aschaffenburg’s Handbook.\r\nHyperthyroidism itself has been, of course, a rather striking feature\r\nin the foreground or background of many sick patients in the war.\r\nHowever, war factors have proved able to bring out very few instances\r\nof cyclothymic (manic-depressive) disease. Amongst our seven cases,\r\nthe first (Case 163) was that of a maniacal Alsatian of 59 years, who\r\nvolunteered because of his hypomania. Case 165, the case of a German\r\nwho pelted French trenches with apples from an appletree in No Man’s\r\nLand, was another case in which the war had little or nothing to do\r\nwith the development of the mania. One of fugue (Case 164) was a case\r\nof melancholia and anxiety not closely related with war experience. In\r\nthree further cases trench life and war stress may be thought to have\r\nliberated the cyclothymic phenomena. Case 166 was that of a man of\r\n38, previously referred to, who developed arteriosclerosis and whose\r\ndepression and hallucinations had followed four months of trench life\r\ndevoid of battles or injury. It is possible that this case should be\r\nregarded rather as syphilitic or of some unknown organic origin. At all\r\nevents, it is not clear that it could be made to bear a heavy weight\r\nof hypothesis concerning the genesis of cyclothymic psychoses. Case\r\n167, a naval officer who distinguished himself greatly by work on land\r\nin Belgium, was regarded by its reporter as one of manic-depressive\r\npsychosis with the fatigue of war as its base. It might be queried\r\nwhether the man’s distinguished work was not due to an early phase\r\nof hypomania, after which the cyclothymic effects began. In Case\r\n168 there was some evidence of the effect of war stress, as certain\r\nhallucinations grew more intense after the bombardment of Dunkirk;\r\nbut in point of fact, this man had shown a predisposition and indeed\r\na period of so-called neurasthenia ante-bellum. It is doubtful,\r\ntherefore, whether there is any case here abstracted which can be used\r\nto support the hypothesis that the manic-depressive (cyclothymic) group\r\nof mental diseases has had or is likely to have its genesis in war\r\nstress. The remaining case (Case 169) is one illustrating a method of\r\ntreating low blood pressure in depression.\r\n\r\nTo sum up concerning the cyclothymias: War stress seems to have had\r\nsingularly little effect in the production of fresh attacks, and so far\r\nas we are aware, no effect in starting up a manic-depressive diathesis,\r\nunless Case 167,--that of the naval officer who distinguished himself\r\nin land battles,--looks in that direction. It is, of course, to\r\nbe conceded that hypomania might readily be overlooked under war\r\nconditions, and that suicidal melancholias, belonging in this group,\r\nmight be interpreted as natural war-made depressions. Very possibly,\r\ntherefore, this result (running to the effect that the cyclothymic\r\nforms of mental disease are rare in military life) may need revision.\r\n\r\n=72.= =Summary of general considerations concerning the nature of the\r\nShell-shock neuroses (paragraphs 40-71).=\r\n\r\n=Having= (_a_) =roughly delimited the Shell-shock neuroses from\r\nsyphilis, epilepsy, and somatic disease, we inquired=\r\n\r\n(_b_) =What, after all, are functional neuroses?

The above diagram indicates that\r\n    “functional” contains more than “psychic.” Doubtless much that\r\n    goes under the name “unconscious” belongs in the right lower\r\n    quadrant of this diagram. See discussion in text.\r\n\r\n(_k_) We found many war cases showing emphasis, reminiscence, or\r\nrepetition of ante-bellum phenomena (weak spots, locus minoris\r\nresistentiae, imitation), but\r\n\r\n(_l_) we also found that perfectly sound untainted men could succumb to\r\nShell-shock neurosis.\r\n\r\n(_m_) We found a few purely psychogenic cases without sign or suspicion\r\nof physical shock.\r\n\r\n(_n_) We studied the localization (traumatotropic) group.\r\n\r\n(_o_) We arrived, with the aid of Babinski, at the necessity of\r\nsplitting functional cases into psychopathic and physiopathic.\r\n\r\n=73.= =Summary of general considerations: continued.=\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves looking on the Shell-shock neuroses as, like other\r\nfunctional neuroses, in a sense mental diseases. Perhaps we would\r\nbetter say (to get rid of all suspicion of medicolegal “insanity”) that\r\nthe Shell-shock neuroses seemed to us in some sense psychopathic. But,\r\nthough the Shell-shock neuroses looked psychopathic and were presumably\r\nmore functional than organic in nature, it was a curious thing that,\r\npractically speaking, the Shell-shock neuroses proved to be farther\r\naway from the more functional of the psychoses than from certain\r\norganic psychosis.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we found reliable authors insisting on the _practical_\r\ndiagnostic necessity of excluding syphilis, epilepsy, somatic\r\ndisease--whereas the nature and causes of the Shell-shock neurosis\r\nseemed _theoretically_ to withdraw them most remotely from that triad\r\nof mainly organic disorders. By the same token, _theoretically_ one\r\nmight have supposed these Shell-shock neuroses to draw very near\r\nto those far less organic disorders (schizophrenia, cyclothymia,\r\nfeeble-mindedness (_i.e._, the slighter degrees likely to be found in\r\nmilitary service, alcoholism))--yet _practically_ few large diagnostic\r\nproblems came to light as between the Shell-shock neuroses and the\r\ntetrad of dynamic or lightly organic diseases above listed.\r\n\r\n=74.= Diagrammatically this situation is presented in Chart 17.\r\n\r\nBut why should the Shell-shock neuroses seem so “organic”? Partly, it\r\nis probable, because the term “organic” is too often used to mean\r\n“subcortical.” In another diagram the truer relations are depicted,\r\nwith four classes of phenomena (Chart 18).\r\n\r\n(_a_) Organic mental (cortical), _e.g._, general paresis.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Functional mental (cortical), _e.g._, hysteria.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Organic neural (subcortical), _e.g._, tabes dorsalis.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Functional neural (subcortical), _e.g._, “reflex” disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSTIC DIFFERENTIATION PROBLEM\r\n\r\n=75.= =Having disposed of the problem of the rougher= DELIMITATION\r\n=of the Shell-shock neuroses, we approach the problem of their finer=\r\nDIFFERENTIATION. =For the sake of the present argument we propose to\r\nregard the Shell-shock neuroses as essentially= DYNAMOPATHIC, _i.e._,\r\n=functional whether in the ordinary mind-born (psychogenic) sense of\r\nclassical hysteria or in the modern nerve-born (neurogenic) sense of\r\nBabinski. The problem of this differentiation will accordingly be that\r\nbetween the dynamopathic and the organopathic.=\r\n\r\nIn the orderly diagnosis of mental disease, from the standpoint of\r\nthe major orders or groups, we ordinarily come at this point to the\r\nfocal brain diseases. In analyzing the neuro-psychiatric problem of\r\na so-called Shell-shocker, it is, of course, our bounden duty to\r\nexclude syphilis. Even though the percentage of syphilitic victims of\r\nShell-shock is not high, yet these cases promise so much from treatment\r\nthat they deserve to get their diagnosis as early as possible, and the\r\nEnglish workers who have worked most in the syphilitic field insist\r\nupon this point.\r\n\r\nWe next proceed, as above indicated, to the elimination of hypophrenia\r\nwith all the various grades of feeble-mindedness. Thirdly, we try to\r\nexclude the various forms of epilepsy; and fourthly, the effects of\r\nalcohol, drugs and poisons.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary civilian practice, such as that at the Psychopathic\r\nHospital, the orderly elimination for diagnostic purposes of the great\r\ngroups of the syphilitic, hypophrenic (feeble-minded), epileptic and\r\nalcoholic, leaves us with cases in which there either is or is not\r\nimportant evidence of organic nervous-system disease, such as that\r\nshown in cases with heightened intracranial pressure or in cases with\r\nasymmetry of reflexes and other forms of parareflexia. In military\r\npractice these logical questions of prior elimination of syphilis,\r\nfeeble-mindedness, epilepsy, and alcoholism must go a-glimmering at\r\nfirst, unless their signs are so obvious as to permit diagnosis by\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\n=76.= But the nervous and mental cases almost one and all give rise\r\nto =the suspicion= at least of =organic disease=, possibly traumatic\r\nin origin. Even when a man falls to the ground without a scratch\r\nupon his skin, there is some question whether in his fall he has not\r\nsustained some slight intracranial hemorrhage which the lumbar puncture\r\nfluid might show. Add to this that the signs of hysteria are very\r\noften unilateral, and it will readily be conceived how much like an\r\norganic case an hysteric in the casualty clearing station may look.\r\nRapid decision may be necessary in order to get immediate effects\r\nin psychotherapy a few minutes or hours after the shell explosion,\r\nand one may need to choose between applying a possibly unsuccessful\r\npsychotherapy forthwith and making a thorough neurological examination.\r\nAs Babinski has pointed out, making a thorough neurological examination\r\ngives opportunity for all sorts of medical suggestion to be conveyed\r\nto the patient. It would appear that many an hysterical anesthesia has\r\nbeen given to a patient by the very suggestion of the physician testing\r\nsensation. Here one does not refer to malingering in the conscious and\r\ndesigned sense of the term, but to the operation of some genuinely\r\npsychopathic, that is to say, hysterical process.\r\n\r\n=77.= In the case of head injury, naturally the majority of nerve\r\nphenomena will ordinarily be upon the opposite side of the body to\r\nthe side of the head that is injured. The reverse situation holds\r\nfor hysterical cases, wherein it would appear that the bursting of a\r\nshell, let us say upon the left side of the body, seems to determine\r\ncontractures, paralyses and anesthesias to that same left side of the\r\nbody; now and then complicated cases appear which put the neurologist\r\nthrough his best paces. Such a case is that of a man who was wounded on\r\nthe left side of the head and promptly developed a =hemiplegia= on the\r\nsame (=left=) side, =with aphasia=. Now aphasia ought to be the result\r\nof a lesion on the left side of the brain in the common run of cases,\r\nwhereas left-sided hemiplegia ought to be the result of lesion on the\r\nright side of the brain. In point of fact, the analyst of this case\r\nfelt that he was dealing with a direct injury on the left side of the\r\nbrain, leading to aphasia, and a lesion by =contrecoup= on the right\r\nside of the brain, leading to a left-sided hemiplegia.\r\n\r\nIt is not only at the casualty clearing stations and along the lines\r\nof communication that the difficulties in telling Shell-shock in the\r\nneurotic sense from traumatic psychosis and the effects of focal brain\r\nlesions are found, since the literature amply shows that diagnostic\r\nproblems remain open for weeks or months in the various institutions of\r\nthe interior, to which all the belligerents have been forced to send\r\ntheir cases.\r\n\r\n=78.= A glance at the differential tables that have been developed, for\r\nexample, by the French neurologists, will show how fine the diagnosis\r\nbetwixt a hysterical and an organic disease may be, especially when\r\nwe consider how often there are admixtures of the two. The rule holds\r\nfor the vast majority of cases that absolute bullet wounds or shrapnel\r\nwounds do not produce Shell-shock; and the statistical story is so\r\nclear that one might almost think of the wounds as in some sense\r\nprotective against shock, that is, against Shell-shock, not against\r\ntraumatic or surgical shock. Nevertheless, by some process whose nature\r\nis obscure, the hysteric is apt to pick up some slight wound and, as it\r\nwere, surround this wound with hysterical anesthesia, hyperesthesia,\r\nparalysis or contractures.\r\n\r\nThe chances are, if we should collect all our civilian cases of Railway\r\nSpine and of industrial accident with traumatic neuroses, we should\r\nbe able to prove this same strange relation between slight wound in a\r\nparticular part of the body and the local determination of hysterical\r\nsymptoms to that region. Of course, the determination follows no known\r\nlaws of nerve distribution to skin or muscles, and the effect is\r\napparently a psychopathic or, at all events, a dynamic process without\r\nclear relations to the accepted landmarks.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to suggest, that aside from the hurry of war, the\r\ndifferential diagnoses here are more difficult than those in civilian\r\npractice; but the difficulties are at least as great as those that\r\nhave faced the civilian practitioner. What needs emphasis is that just\r\nbecause we have concluded that the statistical majority of the cases\r\nof so-called Shell-shock belongs in the division of the neuroses,\r\nwe should =not feel= too =cock-sure that= a given case of =alleged\r\nShell-shock= appearing in the war zone or behind it =is necessarily= a\r\ncase of =neurosis=.\r\n\r\nAfter the early “period of election” for psychotherapy in the war\r\nzone has passed, there can be no excuse except general war conditions\r\nfor not according to every case of alleged Shell-shock a complete\r\nneuropsychiatric examination, having due regard to the ideas of\r\nBabinski concerning medical suggestion of new increments and appendices\r\nto the original hysteria, developed in battle or shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, been able to find in the literature good instances of\r\npuzzling diagnosis in which such conditions are in evidence as acute\r\nmeningitis of various forms, hydrophobia, tetanus, and the like.\r\n\r\nEspecially in the diagnosis against Shell-shock hysterias we may need\r\nto think of the abnormal forms of tetanus, to which an entire book in\r\nthe _Collection Horizon_ has been devoted. The differential diagnostic\r\ntables here draw up distinctions between local tetanus, involving, let\r\nus say, the contracture of one arm, as against a hysterical monoplegia.\r\n\r\n=79.= The focal brain group of psychoses here termed\r\nencephalopsychoses, is illustrated by a comparatively short series of\r\ncases, 16 in number (Cases 103-117). Many more cases of this group are\r\npresented in Section B, On the Nature and Causes of Shell-shock. The\r\nmotive here is to show sundry effects of focal brain lesions produced\r\nin the war and not related with shell-shock. Case 103 was the curious\r\ncase (see above) of aphasia with hemiplegia--not upon the right side,\r\nbut upon the left side. There had been a wound in the left parietal\r\nregion, and the aphasia was presumably consequent upon a direct\r\naffection of the left hemisphere. On the other hand, the left-sided\r\nhemiplegia may probably be regarded as due to lesions on the right side\r\nof the brain produced by contrecoup. The case not only has surgical\r\nimplications and suggestions of importance, but also it throws some\r\nlight on the possibilities in concussion of minor degree. As the\r\ncases in Section B (On the Nature and Causes of Shell-shock) show,\r\nshell-shock, the physical factor, is apt to produce anesthesia and\r\nparalysis or contracture on the side exposed to the shell-shock. The\r\nmeans by which these symptoms ipsilateral with the shock are produced\r\nis commonly thought to be the “hysterical mechanism,” whatever that\r\nmay be. Lhermitte, however, suggests that in some cases such phenomena\r\nmight be due to an actual brain jarring with contrecoup effects.\r\nHowever, it must be granted that Case 103 did not come to autopsy.\r\n\r\n=80.= Case 104 might perhaps better be considered in the section\r\non alcoholism, since a gun-shot wound of the head may be regarded\r\nas having produced intolerance of alcohol in the classical manner,\r\nsimilar to that described in Case 97, wherein, however, the trauma\r\nwas ante-bellum. Peculiar crises associated with cortical blindness,\r\nvertigo, and hallucinations, characterized a case of brain trauma by\r\nbullet (Case 105). Case 106 is that of a Tunisian, who before the war\r\nhad had a number of theopathic traits with mystical hallucinations,\r\nbut after a gun-shot wound of the occiput developed lilliputian\r\nhallucinations and micromegalopsia.\r\n\r\n=81.= Cases 107-112 are cases of infection or probable infection. Cases\r\n107 and 108 are instances of meningococcus meningitis, the second\r\nof which appears to have followed shell-shock (?). Case 107 led to\r\npsychosis with dementia. Case 109 developed a meningitic syndrome,\r\nwhich followed shell explosion a metre away, the syndrome lasting 14\r\nmonths. The spinal puncture fluid was several times found to contain\r\nblood. There was apparently no infection of the fluid as in Case\r\n112. Possibly Case 109 should be set down as an unusual example of\r\nshell-shock psychosis, chiefly dependent upon meningeal hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n=82.= A syphilitic (Case 110) in which appropriate tests were made\r\nand found positive, showed at autopsy a yellowish abscess or area of\r\nsoftening in the right hemisphere. The curious point about this case\r\nwas that the only neurological phenomenon in the case was the absence\r\nof knee-jerks in the early part of the day; later in the day, they\r\nwould appear once more. Possibly Case 111, a case of somewhat doubtful\r\nnature but presumably of organic hemiplegia, ought to be aligned\r\nmore with the group of cases illustrating the nature and causes of\r\nShell-shock. The case was not one with the physical factor shell-shock,\r\nsince the phenomena began ten days after a serene convalescence\r\nfollowing an operation for chronic appendicitis. Perhaps the case was\r\none of organic lesion grafted upon a neurosis.\r\n\r\n=83.= Case 112 is the one noted above of infection of the spinal fluid.\r\nIt is the only case of infected meningeal hemorrhage observed by\r\nGuillain and Barré in a wide experience. As a rule, these hemorrhages\r\nremain aseptic and have a favorable prognosis. The organism cultivated\r\nfrom the spinal fluid proved to be the pneumococcus. Case 113 yielded\r\na somewhat remarkable phenomenon and perhaps would be more logically\r\nconsidered in relation with the series of cases in Section B that show\r\nthe picking up of ante-bellum weak spots (Cases 287-301); for this\r\nsubject had had two serious affections of the brain ante-bellum. He had\r\nhad a poliomyelitis at five, affecting the left leg, and he had had a\r\nright hemiplegia with aphasia following pneumonia, at 20. He was struck\r\n(but apparently not wounded) by shrapnel on the right shoulder, and\r\ndeveloped athetotic movements of the right hand, as well as a general\r\nweakness of the left leg. In this case, according to Batten, the stress\r\nhad been sufficient to bring into prominence symptoms due to an old\r\ncerebral lesion. Whether the mechanism in this case is hysterical is\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n=84.= That not every case of hemianesthesia is hysterical is suggested\r\nby Case 114, in which the diagnosis of hysteria was actually made; but\r\nthe diagnosis was soon rendered doubtful by the fact that there was no\r\nevidence of autosuggestion or heterosuggestion. Other phenomena make a\r\ndiagnosis of thalamic hemianesthesia more likely.\r\n\r\n=85.= Although Shell-shock is not the subject of this section, yet\r\na case of syndrome strongly suggesting multiple sclerosis is here\r\ninserted, following shell-shock (Case 115). The co-existence of\r\nhysterical and organic symptoms is illustrated in Case 116, one of\r\nmine explosion, and Case 117, one of injury to back. Case 116 somewhat\r\nresembled another case of Smyly (Case 219).\r\n\r\n=86.= =Differential Diagnosis between Organic and Hysteric Hemiplegia.\r\nBabinski, 1900.=\r\n\r\n    _Organic Hemiplegia_                  _Hysterical Hemiplegia_\r\n\r\n  1.

These cases differ in no respect from those of Section B\r\nexcept that many of them are more puzzling and dubious and have been\r\npresented by their reporters more from the standpoint of diagnosis\r\nthan from that of etiology or therapeutics. In general arrangement,\r\nthe cases roughly correspond to those of Section B. First are four\r\ncases illustrating the value of =lumbar puncture= data (Cases 371-374).\r\nThere follow cases with either a mixture of =organic and functional\r\nsymptoms=, or such a constellation of symptoms as might readily lead\r\nto erroneous diagnosis (Cases 375-381). =Retention= and =incontinence=\r\nof urine after shell-shock are illustrated in Cases 382-384. =Crural\r\nmonoplegia=, =monocontractures=, and other affections of one leg\r\nare shown in Cases 385-392; but these monocrural cases are in many\r\nrespects peculiar or even unique as compared with the monocrural cases\r\nof Section B. Peculiar paraplegias or spasms affecting =both legs=\r\nare found in the series 393-395.

The =simulation question= is presented\r\nin a series of 20 cases (Cases 453-472).\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL NATURE OF SHELL-SHOCK\r\n\r\n=89.= We are now ready to consider in how far Shell-shock[13] is a\r\ndistinctive disease. The physical event, shell-shock[13] we have seen\r\nat work in most of the major groups of mental disease and in some\r\ngroups of nervous disease. Shell-shock, the physical event, has started\r\nup a “Shell-shock” paresis, a “Shell-shock” epilepsy, a “Shell-shock”\r\nGraves’ disease, a “Shell-shock” dementia praecox, wherein the term\r\n“Shell-shock” is merely a more specific term than the term “traumatic.”\r\nThe physical event, shell-shock, has in special ways also changed the\r\nresponses of the feeble-minded, the alcoholic, the cyclothymic, and the\r\npsychopathic person of whatever ill-defined sort may get into military\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n    [13] I capitalize Shell-shock here (as elsewhere) to indicate\r\n    the name of a supposed disease entity and leave shell-shock\r\n    without an initial capital to indicate the physical event.\r\n\r\nThe physical event, shell-shock, has likewise caused focal irritative\r\nand destructive brain disease, spinal cord disease, peripheral nerve\r\ndisease; and many well-recognized species of the so-called “organic”\r\ndiseases of the nervous system have been produced. Shell-shock\r\n“organic” diseases have proved as difficult to tell from all sorts of\r\nShell-shock “functional” diseases as ever have been the organic and\r\nfunctional analogues of these diseases in peace practice.\r\n\r\nBut, besides (_a_) sharing in the cause of mental and nervous disease\r\n(in the sense of “Shell-shock” general paresis and “Shell-shock” tabes,\r\nwherein at least one other factor, _viz._ the spirochete, is known to\r\nbe at work) and (_b_) producing mental and nervous disease by killing\r\nor weakening or sensitizing neurones in the classical manner of the\r\n“focal” lesion, the physical event, Shell-shock, (_c_) appears able to\r\nbring out the subtler diseases and dispositions of mind which we term\r\npsychoneuroses, that is, hysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia. Just\r\nas we have for years spoken of “traumatic” psychoneuroses, so we may\r\nnow speak of “Shell-shock” psychoneuroses--nor should anyone believe\r\nwe cheat ourselves with the idea that the adjective “Shell-shock”\r\nhas helped us more _re_ genesis than the adjective “traumatic.”\r\n“Shell-shock hysteria” and “traumatic hysteria” are on precisely the\r\nsame--slippery--footing in the matter of their origin. The physics and\r\nchemistry of the psychoneuroses remain in Egyptian darkness.\r\n\r\nThe physical event, shell-shock, then, as the common man might say,\r\naffects body, brain, and mind in a great number of familiar ways; and\r\nthese familiar ways remain as plain or as blind as the neuropathology\r\nand the psychopathology of today leave them. If thunderstorms and\r\nearthquakes got suddenly more frequent, we should have numbers of\r\n“lightning neuroses” and “earthquake hysterias,” neither of which would\r\nrender the physics and chemistry of the psychoneuroses immediately a\r\nwhit clearer.\r\n\r\nWhen the common man speaks of some one as suffering from lightning\r\nstroke or earthquake, he is entitled to be met halfway by his hearer,\r\nwho readily understands that the victim is suffering some sort of\r\ntransient or permanent effects of the stroke or quake. In a like common\r\nsense should the term shell-shock be taken. Stroke, quake, or shock,\r\neach physical event is recognized as a factor in the situation. An\r\nevent has become a factor. A condition for which the noun “shell-shock”\r\nwas descriptive, in the present tense of some event, has passed into\r\nhistory; and the adjective “shell-shock” is now explanatory of the past\r\ncause, or one of the past causes, of a new situation. Shell-shock, the\r\nphysical event, takes part in a great number of pathological events\r\nand as such lapses from noun to adjective.\r\n\r\nBut what are these pathological events, _viz._, the conditions of\r\ndisease, that supervene? So far, in our consideration of psychoses\r\nincidental in the war, we have found Shell-shock _varieties_, perhaps,\r\nof mental disease; again, possibly a few Shell-shock _species_,\r\nusing both these terms, variety and species, in a quasi botanical or\r\nzoölogical sense. But in either instance we do not rise, under the\r\nordinary principles of nomenclature, beyond the adjective: Is there\r\nany evidence that shell-shock, the physical happening, has issued in a\r\npathological event of greater dignity, namely, a _genus of disease_?\r\nCan shell-shock rise to the dignity of a proper noun, Shell-shock,\r\nso that we might think of _e.g._, a new genus of the psychoneuroses,\r\nsomething coördinate with hysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia? None,\r\nI believe, has the hardihood to propose a new genus of mental or\r\nnervous disease for Shell-shock regarded as a pathological event. _A\r\nfortiori_, it is unheard-of to think of Shell-shock, the pathological\r\nevent, as representing a new _order_ of such events, coördinate with\r\nthe psychoneuroses or the epilepsies, for example.\r\n\r\nShell-shock, the pathological event, we conclude, is a variety or a\r\nspecies, hardly a genus or an order of mental or nervous diseases.\r\nIf we can keep in mind the obvious distinction between shell-shock,\r\nthe physical event, and Shell-shock, the pathological event, we shall\r\nsave ourselves much trouble. And if we can apply the ordinary criteria\r\nfor the differentiation of the great groups (or orders) and the\r\nlesser groups (or genera) of mental and nervous disease to the given\r\nconcrete case, we shall not go far wrong therapeutically in any case of\r\nso-called Shell-shock. For Shell-shock, the pathological event, becomes\r\na humble variety or species of disease whose therapeutic indications\r\nare in larger part those of higher and comparatively well-recognized\r\ngenera of disease, _e.g._, hysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia.\r\n\r\nA shock is not a smash, a crush, a breach. A shock literally shakes.\r\nThe shaken thing stays, for a time at least. Shaken up or down, the\r\nvictim of shock is not at first thought of as done for. The spirit of\r\nthe language is against the thought of shock as destruction or even as\r\npermanent irritation. Shock ought to be a “functional” rather than an\r\n“organic” thing, as medicine bandies these terms about. Shell-shock or\r\nSurgical Shock, it is all one to the logic of shock, which is thought\r\nof as a physical or chemical disturbance of mechanisms and arrangements\r\nthat are, or ought to be readjustable. The one character which the late\r\nProfessor Royce told me (in conversation) he could find in the term\r\n“functional” was the idea “reversible.” Shock is or ought to be, as a\r\npathological event, reversible.\r\n\r\nIf this thought is in the backs of our minds as we think of\r\nShell-shock, it can readily be seen why the “organic,” that is,\r\nnon-reversible diseases, do not take kindly to the term Shell-shock.\r\nShell-shock, the pathological event, prefers to be an item in the\r\npathology of function. Can we further specify? The pathology of\r\nfunction, neuropsychically taken, considers such great groups as the\r\npsychoneuroses; (so far as we know) the cyclothymias; some of the\r\nsymptomatic psychoses; a portion of the alcohol and drug group; some\r\nof the epilepsies; perhaps the dementia præcox group; not to mention\r\nvarious unresolved psychopathias. The psychoneuroses are the group most\r\ninnocent of every “organic” taint: the machinery is assumed to be most\r\nnormal in them and presumably the effects of disorder most reversible.\r\n\r\nShall we not therefore accept the psychoneuroses as the group in which\r\nto place those pathological happenings called Shell-shock? It will\r\ndo no harm to make this choice if we do it humbly in the spirit of\r\nacknowledgment that we know next to nothing about the psychoneuroses.\r\nThe psychoneuroses should fall on their knees to Shell-shock rather\r\nthan that Shell-shock make obeisance to the psychoneuroses. For what is\r\na psychoneurosis? It is a functional disease of the nervous system in\r\nwhich the mind plays an important part--it is also probably much else.\r\nBut the “much else” is as likely to be found in Shell-shock as anywhere\r\nelse during these particular years.\r\n\r\nThus, rehearsing in a broad way =the case arrangement of Section B=,\r\nwe find, first, autopsied cases and cases with lumbar puncture data;\r\nthen cases with prominent admixture of organic phenomena; a few cases\r\nto illustrate the victims’ own impressions of their disease; the long\r\ntoe to top, or “cephalad” series (crural monoplegias and paraplegias,\r\ncampto-cormias, astasia-abasias, brachial monoplegias, brachial\r\nparaplegias, deafmutism, blindness); the series to illustrate the idea\r\nof reflex or physiopathic disorders; the series of delayed Shell-shock\r\nphenomena; the series to show the picking out by Shell-shock of\r\nante-bellum weak spots and tendencies in the organism; cases touching\r\nthe hereditary question; peculiar and unique cases; examples of\r\nShell-shock equivalents; and cases of a psychopathic rather than local\r\nhystero-traumatic trend.\r\n\r\n=90.= At the outset of Section B (Shell-shock: Nature and Causes), we\r\nface the question of the possibly organic nature of Shell-shock. It is\r\nsafe to say that the vast majority of cases of Shell-shock do not die\r\nof Shell-shock, and the collection of material from true Shell-shock\r\ncases that are killed by accident or intercurrent disease has proved a\r\nmatter of great difficulty under military conditions. Of course, it is\r\npossible to answer the question _à priori_, by agreeing that any case\r\nwith structural lesion of whatever sort, is by the same token not a\r\ncase of Shell-shock.\r\n\r\n=91.= Apparently the most informatory case yet presented is that\r\nof Mott (Case 197). In this case, death came in 24 hours, and the\r\nimmediate cause of death was doubtless a small hemorrhage of the\r\nspinal bulb. There was a congestion of veins in the bulb, as well as a\r\ncongestion of the pia mater over all other parts of the brain. Nor was\r\nthe bulbar hemorrhage unique, for there were a number of superficial\r\npunctate hemorrhages. In short, the brain was not even grossly normal,\r\nsuch as one might desire in a case of true Shell-shock as conceived\r\nby _à priori_ workers. Yet, according to Mott, there are microscopic\r\nchanges of an intimate nature that lie nearer to the microscopic\r\npossibilities in true Shell-shock. For example, in the bulb itself\r\nthere was a distinct and photographable change of nerve cells: =the\r\nvago-accessorius nucleus had cells in a state of chromatolysis=. The\r\ninternal alterations of these cells, with dissolution of chromatic\r\nmaterial, may possibly indeed have been the direct cause of death or\r\nan indicator of its direct cause. Here again, to accord full justice\r\nto Mott’s contention, we are dealing perhaps more with a phenomenon of\r\nthe cause of death than with a Shell-shock phenomenon. According to\r\nMott, the Shell-shock symptoms themselves are due to capillary anemia\r\nand to nerve cell changes such as he found in various regions. These\r\nnerve cell lesions were of the nature of chromatolysis and identical\r\nwith those of the vago-accessorius nucleus. In this connection, one\r\nthinks of the ideas of Crile concerning exhaustion and its effect upon\r\ncertain nerve cells and other cells, and indeed the whole conception\r\nruns back to the early years of discussion of the meaning of chromatin\r\ndeposits in nerve cells, and to the work on fatigue of such cells.\r\nIt may well be that Mott’s suggestion is sound, and that changes of\r\nthe order of chromatolysis are what subtend some, if not most, of the\r\nphenomena of Shell-shock. On account of the myriad interconnections of\r\nneurones and the remote effects upon normal neurones of disturbances\r\nof a microchemical or microphysical nature in a few neurones, it\r\nwould not do to throw out of court forthwith such a contention as\r\nthat of Mott by triumphantly pointing to the miracle cures of certain\r\nShell-shock phenomena; for it will not necessarily be the chromatolytic\r\n(or otherwise microchemically or physically altered) cells that will\r\nbe directly responsible for the symptoms in question. Cells whose\r\nactivity is but temporarily in abeyance (perhaps by phenomena akin to\r\ndiaschisis) might be reached from an unusual source in the process\r\nof “miracle cure,” whereupon the newly opened paths of energy might\r\nconceivably remain open. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that there\r\nare considerable stretches of speculation in the thread of this\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\n=92.= Particularly important is the question, how frequently such\r\nhemorrhages as those found by Mott in Case 197 occur. Cases are given\r\nin the text which show such hemorrhages.\r\n\r\nRather often quoted in this relation is Case 201, a case of Sencert,\r\nin which a shell exploded one metre away from a soldier and injured\r\nhim so that he died that night through the bursting of the pleura\r\nof both lungs within a thoracic cage which was quite intact. This\r\nsort of finding reminds one of cases in which the inner partitions\r\nof houses are burst by explosion when the outer walls remain intact.\r\nIn particular, one thinks of the physical changes within an aneroid\r\nbarometer, which have been shown to come about when something is\r\nexploded near by. If such an event may happen as the bursting of the\r\nlungs within an otherwise intact body, so also is there evidence that\r\na similar event occurs in the nervous system. Clinical evidence of\r\nthis is obtained in the hemorrhage and pleocytosis of spinal fluid\r\nobtained early in the clinical examination of certain cases. In fact,\r\nin Case 205 (one of Souques), there is a pleocytosis of the fluid\r\nas late as a month after shell-shock. When there is no pleocytosis\r\nor hemorrhage, there may be a hypertension of the fluid,--a finding\r\nsometimes attributed to Dejerine (see, for example, Case 207, of\r\nLeriche). It might be inquired whether the fall sustained by the\r\npatient as a result of the shell explosion could not be responsible for\r\nthe hemorrhage, and this may indeed be the fact in certain instances.\r\nBabinski has offered in Case 209, an instance in which hematomyelia\r\n(with later partial recovery) was produced in a subject who was lying\r\nprone in the performance of machine-gun duty (the phenomena in this\r\ncase were well described by the victim himself, a veterinary student\r\nwho was six months a captive in Germany). Doubtless, it would not be\r\ndifficult to produce a complete series of cases with and without trauma\r\nto the tissues investing the nervous system, with definite clinical or\r\nautopsy evidence of organic lesions of the nervous system, whether by\r\nmechanical impact, by the concussion (windage) of the air, or even by\r\nthe effects of muscular contractions.\r\n\r\n=93.= A case of Chavigny’s (Case 198), in which there was an extremely\r\ncareful autopsy, showed a strongly blood-stained cerebrospinal fluid;\r\nin fact, there was an intradural hemorrhage, though of minor degree and\r\npossibly not the cause of death; and throughout the brain substance\r\nthere were slight hemorrhagic points. But there was no sign whatever\r\nof fracture of the cranial vault or base. Another case of similar\r\nmeningeal hemorrhage but sharply localized, was Case 199, an instance\r\nof minor explosion in which neither skin nor muscles, bone or viscera\r\nshowed any lesion; and the death, which occurred in seven days, seemed\r\nhardly explicable on the basis of hemorrhage itself. In fact, this case\r\nwould require the sort of microscopic examination performed by Mott in\r\nCase 197 for a proof of the cause of death, which was thought by the\r\nreporters themselves (Roussy and Boisseau) to be within the field of\r\nhistology.\r\n\r\n=94.= Case 200 seems to bring proof that there may be areas of gross\r\nsoftening within the spinal cord produced by the concussion of the\r\ncord from shell-burst, although there had been no fracture of the\r\nspine itself and no penetration of splinters of shell or of bone into\r\nthe spinal canal or the substance of the cord itself. The argument\r\nhere is that the tissues that lie between the agent of violence and\r\nthe interior of the spinal cord are affected _en bloc_ by the impact,\r\nthe resultant gross or molar lesions being several millimetres or\r\ncentimetres from the point reached by the impinging body or force.\r\nHow complicated such a situation might be, we may recall from a case\r\npreviously studied, namely, Case 103 (Lhermitte), wherein a missile\r\nstruck the left side of the skull and produced lesions beneath its\r\npoint of impact, but at the same time apparently caused a _contre-coup_\r\neffect upon the opposite hemisphere. That particular case did not come\r\nto autopsy, but Lhermitte’s explanation of its queer association of\r\naphasia with ipsilateral hemiplegia seems sound enough. In fine, what\r\nwith the mechanical trauma to which many victims of shell explosion\r\nare subject, what with the findings in sundry autopsies, and what with\r\nthe determination of hemorrhage in the spinal fluid early after the\r\nshock, it might be conceived that the majority of cases of Shell-shock\r\nare actually cases of mechanical injury to the brain or spinal cord in\r\nwhich hemorrhage or laceration and overriding of neuronic tissues would\r\nbe found. Nor would such a hypothesis be _prima facie_ absurd with the\r\nevidence afforded by certain cases of Shell-shock having an admixture\r\nof reflex phenomena and other symptoms proved by the older neurologists\r\nto be beyond peradventure organic. (Compare, for example, such a case\r\nas that of Case 210, with herpes zoster and segmentary symptoms.) It\r\nshould be remembered, however, that Mott in the case cited above (Case\r\n197) sharply distinguishes between the hemorrhages (especially the\r\nbulbar hemorrhage which caused death) and the nerve cell chromatolysis\r\nwhich he regarded as possibly at the basis of Shell-shock symptoms.\r\nIt is decidedly doubtful whether the hypothesis of microscopic or\r\nlarger hemorrhages, or of local areas of destruction of neurones will\r\nsuffice for the explanation of true Shell-shock. This is not to say\r\nthat in the diagnosis of true Shell-shock (that is, roughly speaking,\r\nthe psychoneurosis), we shall not need to concede and consider in\r\nevery case the possibility of =traumatic focal brain disease=. This\r\nwill always need =to be faithfully excluded= in all cases unless the\r\ninitial set-up of symptoms is so suggestive of immediately curable\r\npsychoneurosis that without further ado miracle-therapy is undertaken\r\nand executed. But in virtually all the slower cases, an exclusion of\r\norganic brain and cord disease is undertaken. Admixtures of organic and\r\nfocal phenomena are quite in the order of everyday occurrence.\r\n\r\n=95.= Especially good instances of this co-existence of functional\r\nand organic symptoms are found in ear cases; and it may be suspected\r\nthat when, after the war, all these data can be suitably gathered and\r\ncompared, it will be from the field of otology that some of the most\r\nfruitful hypotheses will be developed. In the cases of Shell-shock\r\ndeafness, mechanical peripheral factors are admixed with central\r\nfactors in phenomena admitting in some ways more exact diagnosis than\r\nin other fields. We may await the correlation of these data by some\r\nworker, equally skilled in otology and neurology, with the profoundest\r\ninterest. Analogous results may be hoped from a correlation of\r\nneurological and ophthalmological conceptions.\r\n\r\n=96.= Suffice it to say that the differentiation of organic and\r\nfunctional phenomena has long been possible on the basis of what we\r\nknow concerning various reflexes (_e.g._, the Babinski reflex and\r\nits congeners); and the net result of this work is that the majority\r\nof Shell-shock cases,--that is, cases in which the physical factor\r\nshell-shock has entered,--are probably not cases in which a coarse\r\norganic disease could be proved to exist, or assumed with any color\r\nof likelihood to exist. Even limiting ourselves to cases in which the\r\nphysical factor shell-shock or some sort of impact with or without\r\nan external wound occurred, we shall find cases enough of a truly\r\nfunctional nature, as indicated by their reflexes, to render it quite\r\nimpossible to assert that they are in the classical sense “organic”\r\ncases. Putting these cases with the physical shell-shock factors\r\ntogether with the other large series of cases in which precisely\r\nsimilar symptoms occur without the presence of the physical shell-shock\r\nfactor, we shall find ourselves convinced that classical Shell-shock\r\nphenomena are by and large what is called functional. We shall arrive\r\nat the hypothesis that they are cases of hysteria or other form of\r\npsychoneurosis, entitled to the diagnosis of traumatic hysteria (or\r\nhysterotraumatism, in the sense of Charcot), or not, according to\r\nwhether the physical factor shell-shock was in evidence. What now\r\nunderlies the concept functional, as we use it in Charcot’s sense of\r\nhysterotraumatism, or in the more modern phrase traumatic hysteria?\r\nDo we perhaps mean some microchemical or microphysical change of a\r\nreversible nature, similar to that described by Mott, _e.g._, in Case\r\n197? It is not possible to answer this question at this time.\r\n\r\n=97.= But if we give up the hypothesis of organic disease of the\r\nnervous system (that is, the hypothesis of coarse lesions, small or\r\nlarge, conceived to be the direct effect of mechanical impact), can we\r\nincriminate any other factor? Chemical factors from the gas of bursting\r\nshells may be thought of; yet in abundant cases there is no evidence\r\nthat these have been in play. They and a variety of other special\r\ncauses may be found working in a few instances but have nothing to do\r\nwith the moot question.\r\n\r\n=98.= Upon giving up the organic hypothesis, the modern functionalist\r\nis very apt to run directly into the embrace of hysteria. If a thing\r\nis not physical, it must be psychical in its genesis, so runs the\r\nargument. What, after all, is a neurosis? We mean ordinarily by\r\nneurosis, something functional rather than structural. We often mean\r\nsomething psychical rather than peripheral. Accordingly, as we have\r\nseen, many writers rush to the hypothesis that Shell-shock effects,\r\nexcept in a few unusual instances of organic disease, are functional;\r\nand not only are they functional but psychic, and maintained by some of\r\nthe so-called “mechanisms” which abound in modern speculative writing.\r\n\r\n=99.= Case 253, a case of Tinel, may serve to illustrate this point.\r\nTinel’s patient was not subject to shell-shock at all, but was wounded\r\nin the arm. Three weeks later, he was able to flex his forearm only\r\nby means of the supinator longus. It was found that the biceps was\r\nsoft and flaccid, though the electrical reactions of the biceps were\r\nnormal. Now, since flexion of the forearm is normally produced by a\r\nsynergic contraction of the biceps and supinator longus, the situation\r\nin Tinel’s case was striking in that the functions of the biceps and\r\nsupinator longus had been separated out by a process which could not be\r\nhysterica. The hypothesis is that in hysteria it has always been found\r\nimpossible to split the synergic action of these two muscles. What has\r\nhappened? In Tinel’s picturesque phrase, the biceps muscle has been\r\n=stupefied= by a process which involved no destruction of a nerve trunk\r\nor any important nerve elements. This process of stupefaction passed\r\naway with a few weeks’ massage and rhythmic faradism. But what is this\r\nprocess of stupefaction, as Tinel calls it? No definite answer can be\r\ngiven. But is not the process analogous to what may happen in a variety\r\nof cases of shell explosion in which, for one reason or another, sundry\r\nneurones are, as it were, stupefied, stunned, anesthetized, or thrown\r\nout of gear by some internal physico-chemical readjustment of unknown\r\nnature? Perhaps that readjustment, though in Tinel’s case it probably\r\ntook place within the tissues of the arm itself, is analogous to the\r\nchromatolytic process in nerve-cell bodies suspected by Mott to be at\r\nthe bottom of certain Shell-shock symptoms as in Case 197.\r\n\r\n=100.= Are there, then, phenomena of peripheral nerve shock analogous\r\nto the phenomena of spinal cord and brain shock which we find in so\r\nmany cases? But if so, it is clearly unnecessary, and indeed injurious\r\nfor us to conceive that cases proved not to be organic must necessarily\r\nbe hysterical. Several authors have called a halt upon this undue\r\nextension of the concept of hysteria to include all the non-organic\r\nphenomena. Take, for example, the case of the Victoria Cross winner\r\n(Case 529), reported by Eder, in which a contracture was shown by\r\nhypnosis to be a representation of the patient’s clutch upon his\r\nbayonet (he had been at Gallipoli and was wounded in fourteen places\r\nduring a bayonet fight with Turks). It would not be possible--in fact,\r\nit would seem almost impolite--to refuse to entertain the hypothesis of\r\na kind of symbolism in the bayonet-clutch contracture of Eder’s case;\r\nbut it would, on the contrary, be far from exact to consider all cases\r\nof contracture to be even probably or possibly symbolic in the manner\r\nof the bayonet-clutch. There are, many workers feel, many functional\r\nphenomena that are non-hysterical, and as it were infra-hysterical in\r\nthe sense that the “mechanisms” (to use that over-worked term) are\r\nin neurones below the level of complexity required by hysteria. This\r\ntheoretical possibility (that the functional should be divided into\r\nthe psychical and the infrapsychical) has been given a new status by\r\nthe work of Babinski and his associates. That work seems to show that\r\nthe older doctrines of Charcot concerning the existence of “reflex”\r\ndisorders, are perfectly sound.\r\n\r\n=101.= Babinski has been able to bring into the light of observation\r\nthe morbid operation of certain of these reflex arcs. Even in cases\r\nwhere in the waking life the central nervous system is able to\r\noverpower the reflex arcs in question and permit the limb or limbs to\r\nwork reasonably well and smoothly, the process of chloroform anesthesia\r\nwill quickly bring out an odd and unsuspected interior situation. The\r\nchloroform suspends the operation of numerous neurones, including those\r\nthat have to do with the downflow of cerebral inhibitions, those silent\r\nstreams of impulse that serve to keep the knee-jerks, for example,\r\nin leash. Now at a time when all the other muscles of the body are\r\nrelaxed, the withdrawal of the cerebral inhibitions by chloroform\r\nanesthesia may cause a phenomenon to appear in certain reflex arcs\r\nthat argues an excess of activity; thus in the leg, for example, an\r\nankle-clonus, or a patella-clonus, or a degree of contracture, may be\r\nbrought about early in chloroform anesthesia, though there had been\r\nlittle or no suspicion of such a tendency in the waking life. The\r\ncerebral inhibitions in the waking life have been enough to dampen the\r\nardor of the reflex arc in question. It must be remarked that these\r\ncases of reflex, or, as Babinski termed them, _physiopathic disorders_,\r\nas a rule occur in cases locally wounded. It is the locally wounded\r\nlimb that develops functional excess of contained reflex arcs. Does\r\nthis occur by a process of neuritis, or by some other unknown process?\r\nWhatever the answer to this question, Babinski and his associates\r\nappear to have shown the existence of a group of physiopathic or reflex\r\ndisorders; disorders below the level of the psyche and below the\r\ntheatre of operations of hysteria.\r\n\r\n=102.= Practically speaking, also, it is important not to consider\r\nevery functional situation hysterical, since the non-hysterical\r\nfunctional changes may be extremely obstinate to treatment. Both\r\nphysician and patient suffer if the patient is treated along\r\npsychotherapeutic lines for hysterical symptoms, some of which turn out\r\non investigation to be functional enough but non-psychic. The peculiar\r\nconfiguration of symptoms shown in cases with the physical shell-shock\r\nor its equivalent, is perhaps dependent upon what neurones are locally\r\naffected. If there has been good evidence of near-by explosion or of\r\nwound, it will be especially important to learn just what parts of the\r\nnervous system and just what synergic neurones and other structures\r\nwere affected. Whether the process within these neurones be one\r\nanalogous to the dissolution of chromatin, or whether the process is\r\nmore like one of narcosis, or narcosis and stupefaction, or whether the\r\nprocess is more like that of a stun, or like the plight of the nerves\r\nin a foot for a long time “asleep,” it may be impossible to say; but it\r\nis entirely unnecessary to soar directly to the higher mental process,\r\nunnecessary in short, to assume a hysterical dissociation when the\r\ndissociation may be far lower down in the nervous system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT OF SHELL-SHOCK NEUROSES\r\n\r\n=103.= We have pictured the practical situation in which the neuroses\r\nof the war find themselves--a situation bristling with diagnostic\r\ndifficulties. The great proposition deducible therefrom is,\r\n\r\n=The diagnostic problem in Shell-shock is the diagnostic problem of\r\nneuropsychiatry at large.=\r\n\r\nThe neuroses of war have this in common with the neuroses of\r\npeace--that they need to be distinguished from all other nervous and\r\nmental diseases. One cannot be a specialist in Shell-shock unless one\r\nis a neuropsychiatric specialist; even the neuropsychiatrist has much\r\nto learn from the internist, the orthopedist, the neurosurgeon, as well\r\nas from the psychologist.\r\n\r\n=But however wide the diagnostic field for Shell-shock, the therapeutic\r\nfield is wider still.= For the neuropsychiatric reconstructionist has\r\nto face the peculiarities of the military status of his ward, the\r\ndifficulties of demobilization into civilian life (a canal system\r\nwith very precise technic for the opening and closing of locks), the\r\nchoice and timing of the proper measures of bedside occupation, of\r\noccupation therapy in a broader sense, of prevocational and vocational\r\ntraining--the whole complicated by the character changes that may have\r\nset in to bowl over all one’s preconceptions. The nub of the matter,\r\nafter the era of the _manière forte_, the brusque psychotherapy, the\r\nrough jarring of the man back into approximate normality is, perhaps,\r\nthis potentiality of subtle character changes defying possibly\r\nanybody’s analysis, but stimulating us all to our best endeavor,\r\nwhether we are physicians, psychologists, occupation-workers, social\r\nworkers, or nurses. Now that all sorts of reconstruction programs\r\nare in the air, each claiming its share, or more than its share,\r\nof attention, let us not forget that no one can stake out in any\r\nsmall plot the measures of refitting, readjustment, readaptation,\r\nrehabilitation--all these terms with slightly differing denotation have\r\nbeen used--especially when we take into account that not only must\r\nthe patient be refitted to his entourage, but also not seldom the\r\nentourage to its returned Shell-shocker.\r\n\r\n=104.= It is proper to place these general considerations first\r\nbecause =the slow, patient, prosaic measures of reëducation are apt\r\nto be forgotten in our enthusiasm for the lightning-like cures of\r\nthe hypnotic, the psychoelectric, the pseudo-operative, and other\r\npsychotherapeutic forms=. Psychotherapy in all its forms has come into\r\nits own in Shell-shock. Miracles or their equivalents are daily wrought\r\nby men who are not prophets. Lourdes and Christian Science have their\r\nunassuming rivals. Let us remember, however, that even Lourdes and\r\nChristian Science never solved 100% of the problems placed before them,\r\neven though the votaries have the best will in the world to be cured.\r\nIf the will itself is disordered, what can be done save investigate?\r\nAnd the _mauvaise volonté_ is by no means absent from some of our\r\nprospective patients; witness one man, a Frenchman, who so resented\r\nbeing cured by _torpillage_, _i.e._, by the electric brush, that he\r\ncarried his case against Clovis Vincent, who cured him of his hysteria,\r\nclear to the Academy! And, even after we have cured our cases by these\r\nmodern miracles, let us not be too proud of ourselves! One soldier\r\nsent back to Australia, hysterically mute for months, got his voice\r\nback after killing a snake--a peculiar instance of occupation-therapy,\r\nnot enumerated in courses on reconstruction. And remember the man who\r\njumped the wall and got drunk, breaking back into the hospital to\r\nshow his doctor how his refractory voice had at last come back. Thus\r\nthere are cures and cures (even a newspaper cure of mutism by a moving\r\npicture vision of the antics of Charlie Chaplin), and spontaneous\r\nnon-medical cures as well as medical ones, and slow cures due to _vis\r\nmedicatrix_, as well as to shrewd reëducation measures.\r\n\r\n=105.= I shall not attempt to cover systematically the topic of\r\nShell-shock therapy in this epicrisis. The reader must go through the\r\ntreated cases, especially in Section D but _passim_ elsewhere, if he is\r\nto obtain a proper conception of all the methods so far employed--and\r\nat the end he cannot know the ultimate outcome of the cases. Patrons\r\nof the miracle cures and the _manière forte_ are having their day: on\r\nthe whole, the law of =sudden onset, sudden ending= has much to say for\r\nitself in the hysterical (pithiatic) group. Forebodings of relapse in\r\nthese =torpedoed= cases may indeed have some foundation: but figures\r\nare yet lacking, and relapses may be as expectantly predicted in the\r\n=slow-onset, slow-cure= group. =The decision must be post-bellum.= Nor\r\nmust the fact that a few absolutely normal subjects have succumbed _de\r\nnovo_ to Shell-shock blind us to the fact that, statistically speaking,\r\nmost cases are _ab ovo_ psychopaths in whom relapses, recurrences, or\r\nnew instances of neurosis may be confidently expected. For these _ab\r\novo_ psychopaths, what can suffice but (_a_) removal of the disease\r\nby the _vis medicatrix naturae_; or (_b_) reëducation, intellectual\r\nor (_c_) moral (as the case may be); or else (_d_) some plan of\r\nenvironmental shielding from new occasions of disease?\r\n\r\n=106.= I shall content myself with a brief survey (insisting that\r\nthe details be read of at least the leading cases in each treatment\r\nsubgroup) of the cases offered in Section =D= (Shell-shock: Treatment\r\nand Results), consisting of 117 cases (Cases 473-589). The cases are\r\nin general arranged with the =spontaneous and quasi-natural cures= at\r\nthe outset,--a series of 11 cases (Cases 473-483). The remainder of\r\nthe section deals with cures under medical conditions, although many\r\ncases naturally show an interplay of non-medical factors in the cure or\r\npersistence of one or more symptoms.\r\n\r\nA few cases illustrative of the =physical value of hydrotherapy=,\r\n=mechanical therapy=, and =drugs= are given in a short series (Cases\r\n484-489). A treatment of hysterical contractures by =induced fatigue=\r\nis dealt with in Cases 489-493; and the occasional value of =surgery=\r\nis shown by Case 494.\r\n\r\nThe simpler methods of =persuasion and explanation= follow in a series\r\nof 19 cases (Cases 495-513).\r\n\r\n=Pseudo-operations= and =suggestive operative manipulation= of avail in\r\nthe treatment of certain local hysterical phenomena are considered in a\r\nseries of eight cases (Cases 514-521). The comparatively long =hypnotic\r\nseries= follows: 27 cases (Cases 522-548). The above-mentioned cures\r\nby pseudo-operation and by hypnosis may be classified with those that\r\nfollow, _i.e._, mainly rapid cures by =psychoelectric= methods and by\r\n=suggestion on emergence from anesthesia= (Cases 549-574), as modern\r\nmiracles. These cases of modern miracle are followed by a briefer set\r\nof =reëducative cases= (Cases 575-589).\r\n\r\nThroughout the treatment section are scattered instances in which, not\r\na cure, but merely a modification or even a persistence of symptoms was\r\nthe outcome. It is useful to bear in mind, while reading cases in the\r\netiological and diagnostic sections, these main divisions of treatment\r\ninto what might be called (1) spontaneous, (2) rapid (or “miraculous”)\r\nand (3) slow or reëducative.\r\n\r\n=107.= It is beyond the scope of this book to deal systematically with\r\nthe hospital and administrative side of these questions. Especially\r\nthe zone question is of practical importance, that is, the question of\r\narrangements at the front, on evacuation lines, and in the interior.\r\nRoussy and Lhermitte have particularly discussed these matters.\r\n\r\nAfter thirty months’ experience in the psychiatric centers of two\r\narmies, Damaye suggested an organization of psychiatric centers in two\r\nparts,--First, a service draining patients =from the firing line=,\r\nrapidly give them first care and evacuate them, =in charge of special\r\nattendants=, to: Second, a psychiatric or neurological =center in the\r\ncommunication zone= (_étapes_) without danger of bombardment and at a\r\ndistance from the guns. The more serious cases will then be evacuated,\r\nthirdly, into the interior from these centers along communication\r\nlines. But most will have gotten well at the front.\r\n\r\n=108.= By orthopedists and mechanotherapeutists too much stress may\r\nindeed be laid on non-psychiatric measures, as Duprat hints. Yet\r\nperhaps neuropsychiatrists may need as much coaching in the opposite\r\ndirection. One must remember the non-psychopathic fraction of these\r\nShell-shock disorders and their need of diathermy (Babinski). Duprat\r\nsays that the centers for physiotherapy cannot effectively do the work\r\nof all Shell-shock therapy, as the physiotherapists have their aims\r\nfixed on nerves and muscles rather than the mind. Each case requiring\r\npsychotherapy ought to be studied in an =experimental psychological\r\nlaboratory= from a number of points of view such as mechano-motor\r\ncapacity, the sensibility, emotional and intellectual sides, memory,\r\nimpulses and the like. Testing apparatus should be available\r\ntogether with dynamometers, sphygmometers, chronoscopes, ergographs,\r\npneumographs, cardiographs and recording apparatus.\r\n\r\n                               CHART 19\r\n\r\n               PSYCHOELECTRIC AND REËDUCATIVE TREATMENT\r\n\r\n    PHASE   I.

PROLONGED SPECIAL TRAINING\r\n\r\n                                               After Clovis Vincent\r\n\r\nSpecialists for consultation should be available, including\r\nophthalmologists, otologists, laryngologists and electrical\r\nspecialists. The tests over, the patient should be examined as it\r\nwere, in a free state and his habits and character noted. Hypnosis may\r\nbe tried but it should not be prolonged. Psychic contagion is to be\r\navoided especially in the case of subjects with epileptoid crises.\r\n\r\nIt would be well to establish for the cases regarded as susceptible to\r\npsychotherapy, =reëducation centers= like those for the re-adaptation\r\nof the tuberculous. The improved tuberculous are sent to health centers\r\nunder the Ministry of the Interior for three months at the maximum and\r\nemerge much better able to support the exigencies of life. According\r\nto Duprat, there ought to be =psychotherapy centers= which should not\r\nin any sense recall asylums for the insane. Set in the country but\r\nnot far from the city, managed by the psychological physicians and\r\n“_médecins psychologues, plus éducateurs que médecins_.” The personnel\r\nshould consist of students going into psychiatry and of teachers whose\r\npedagogical practice ought to enable them to second the efforts of the\r\npsychiatrists. In this way we might avoid the perpetuation of some of\r\nthe psychopathies of war.\r\n\r\n=109.= Possibly “putting forward the best foot” may yield a wrong\r\nimpression of the proportion of what I have termed “miracle cures.”\r\nOther devices of a slower nature are mentioned throughout the book.\r\nPerhaps much depends on the temperament of the psychotherapeutist,\r\nas _e.g._, Laignel-Lavastine has remarked about the method of\r\npsychotherapy by means of conversation: that =one might easily remain\r\nin a honeymoon state in military psychotherapy=. When hundreds and\r\nthousands of functional nervous cases pass through one’s hands it is\r\nnecessary to remember that behind the conversation there stands the\r\nimposing finger of material force.\r\n\r\nCompare the work of Clovis Vincent, Yealland, Kaufmann.\r\n\r\n=110.= On the other hand, Rows points out that shock is a term that\r\ndoes not explain at all adequately the great variety of mental\r\nillnesses occurring in the soldiers at the front. The term is popularly\r\nused for cases which recover quickly, but in the majority of cases\r\nthere is a residuum after the shock has disappeared. Accordingly Rows’\r\nwork has dealt chiefly with underlying causes, conditions, and factors.\r\nHere we may consider\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The =war strain= before breakdown;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) =Special causes= of shock, such as death of comrades near\r\n          by, near-by shell explosions and blowing up of trenches;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) =Fatigue and exhaustion= with lowered capacity of\r\n          resistance.\r\n\r\n    The men themselves find that they have\r\n\r\n    (_d_) undergone a =change of character=, having become\r\n          irascible, unable to sustain interest and attention;\r\n          solitary and morose, and less capable of self-control.\r\n          Anxiety, worry and a state of morbid expectancy set in.\r\n          Everyday trifles are exaggerated.\r\n\r\n    But below these cases are still deeper ones, such as\r\n\r\n    (_e_) revival of =horrible memories and terrifying dreams=\r\n          of war scenes, together with memories of incidents of\r\n          past life.\r\n\r\n    (Rows attributes to Dejerine the idea that the cause of all\r\n    cases of hysteria and neurasthenia must be sought in antecedent\r\n    emotion.)\r\n\r\nEmotion compels attention, and to such a degree in some cases that\r\nthe memories and attendant fears and anxieties cannot be expelled.\r\nHallucinations and delusions may then develop. The patient is largely\r\nincapable of reasoning about his status; he lacks “insight into the\r\nnature and mode of origin of his mental illness. This insight can be\r\nprovided by explaining to him in plain language the mechanism of simple\r\nmental processes, by enabling him to understand that every incident is\r\naccompanied by its own special emotional state, and that this emotional\r\nstate can be re-awakened by the revival of the incident in memory.” The\r\npatient and the physician now “begin to realize that they have some\r\nground in common.… The mystery of the illness will be swept away and\r\nthe physician will be able to … show him how he can educate himself\r\nto regain that which was lost.” “The patient can be induced to face\r\nthe trouble.” “The excessive emotional tone will thus be stripped away\r\nand the patient will thus become able to appreciate the real value of\r\nthe incident.” “The reëducation must vary with each case in order to\r\novercome the difficulties connected with the specific cause which has\r\nbeen discovered.”\r\n\r\nRows’ work has been done at the Red Cross Hospital at Maghull, and\r\nseveral of the Maghull cases have been reported in Elliot Smith and\r\nT. H. Pear’s book on Shell-shock. A somewhat similar point of view\r\nhas been maintained by Wm. Brown, who has suggested the neat term\r\n_autognosis_ for psychoanalysis. W. A. Turner speaks of the Maghull\r\npoint of view as one of modified psychoanalysis.\r\n\r\n=111.= Or again a species of combination of the _manière forte_ and the\r\n_manière douce_ (operations, shall we say with William James, of the\r\n“tough-minded” and the “tender-minded” respectively?) may be used as in\r\nthe formula\r\n\r\nSYMPATHY + FIRMNESS (MOTT).\r\n\r\n=112.= More special devices, suggesting faintly the methods of animal\r\ntraining, may be used, as described in the following account of a new\r\n=isolation and psychotherapeutic service= established in May, 1915,\r\nat the =Salpêtrière= for soldiers with functional nervous diseases.\r\nThe basic idea has long been held by Dejerine,--the avoidance of\r\nheterosuggestion by other patients, imitation, ill effects of visits\r\nfrom members of the family. The functional additions that come from\r\nnear-by organic patients are among the disadvantages of the ordinary\r\ntreatment. The isolation service of the neurological center is composed\r\nof 34 beds, arranged in two halls, with three extra rooms. Each bed is\r\nisolated. The régime in one of the rooms is more rigorous than in the\r\nother, and =it is an advance for a patient to be moved from the first\r\nto the second room=. The patient on wakening has no right to leave his\r\nbox or communicate with his neighbors. He leaves only to be treated\r\nby hydrotherapy or electrotherapy. He takes his meals in isolation,\r\nreceives no calls, and has no leave to go out. The physician sees the\r\npatient twice a day and carries on psychotherapy and motor reëducation,\r\nas well as special treatments.\r\n\r\nWomen nurses care for the patients. A system of control and of\r\n=progressive rewards= has been installed, being a sort of metric\r\nevaluation of the process of cure. As the cure proceeds the patient’s\r\nlot is progressively mitigated, or if he gets worse the regime is\r\nclamped down. Suppose a man a victim of paralysis of leg--the height to\r\nwhich he can lift his leg is measured in centimeters daily as well as\r\nthe time during which he can hold the leg in air; or, the progress of\r\nan ankle, or of the forearm or the arm in a case of arm contracture,\r\nis measured. The grade obtained by our =scholar in psychotherapy= is\r\ninscribed upon a slate. Finally, walks, concerts, visits and eventually\r\npermission to go out into the town are granted.\r\n\r\n=113.= =Can Shell-shock neuroses be prevented=, other than by stopping\r\nor modifying the war or by weeding out Shell-shock candidates as\r\nthey volunteer or are drafted? Morton Prince offers points of some\r\nsuggestive value. The very various proportions of neurosis observed in\r\ndifferent units and arms of the service suggest that various degrees\r\nof preparedness may have played a part. Bernheim says =suggestion= is\r\nan =idea accepted=. Aside from a possible increase of simulation, much\r\nmight depend on what idea administered really got accepted! Morton\r\nPrince’s plan is that the prevention must be based upon the education\r\nof the mind. This therapeutic education should be based, however,\r\non a preliminary systematic study by a board of specialists in the\r\npsychoneuroses of (_a_) the mental attitude of minds generally toward\r\nshell fire, and (_b_) clinical varieties of this “shock” neurosis as it\r\noccurs in trench warfare, (_c_) its frequency and disabling incidence,\r\nand (_d_) the state of mind previous to the trauma of those suffering\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the findings of such a study, first, the regimental\r\nsurgeon through lectures and clinical demonstrations would be\r\ninstructed systematically in the symptoms and pathology of the disease\r\nand the methods of psychotherapy for its prevention.\r\n\r\nSecond, soldiers, including officers, could then, in units of say 100,\r\nin turn be instructed in the nature of the disease through lectures by\r\nregimental surgeons. Shell-shock, they should be told, is a form of\r\nhysteria caused by mental factors. The work of the instruction should\r\nbe done in France in the atmosphere of the war, wherein would be formed\r\nan attitude of healthy mental preparedness instead of an attitude of\r\nfear and mystery. Has mental hygiene this great scope? =Is morale\r\nmerely education?=\r\n\r\n=114.= =What after all, is Morale?= We hope to learn a little about it\r\nfrom this war for use hereafter, when we can say with the Florentine\r\n\r\n    _e quindi uscimmo a riveder le stelle_\r\n\r\n    And thence we issued out again to see the stars\r\n\r\n                          Inferno, Canto XXXIV, 139.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThese references were collected in the main by Sergeant Norman Fenton\r\nboth before and after his entering the army, in connection with\r\npreparations for the work of one of the Neuropsychiatric Training\r\nSchools (that at Boston), established by the Division of Neurology\r\nand Psychiatry of the Surgeon-General’s Office, U. S. Army. The\r\nwork, through the year 1917, at least, is not a mere _vernis de\r\nbibliographe_, but is based on a first-hand search through journals\r\navailable in the Boston Medical Library and the New York Academy of\r\nMedicine (to whose officers thanks are due for very special privileges\r\naccorded). After Sergeant Fenton’s departure for service in the war\r\nneurosis hospital, 117, American E. F., France, the work was finished\r\nby the writer in considerable haste by skimming the current indexes\r\nand gathering the more prominent titles for 1918 (some for 1919).\r\nThe titles, be it noted, go beyond the scope of the case-material in\r\nthe body of the book and cover also a variety of reconstructional,\r\nreëducational, clinical-neurological, neurosurgical, and other topics\r\nbearing indirectly on neuropsychiatry. These auxiliary subjects are by\r\nno means completely covered, but it was thought the titles might help\r\nother inquirers. Under the war conditions numerous errors have no doubt\r\ncrept into the references, which errors we hope will not, by reason of\r\nthe short space of time covered by the bibliography, prove particularly\r\nmisleading. The auxiliary topics can be referred to in the Index under\r\npage-numbers after the word “Bib.”\r\n\r\nE. E. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n    =Abadie.= La neuro-psychiatrie d’urgence aux armées.
