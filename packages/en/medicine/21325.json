Boston, Massachusetts\r\n\r\nLibrary of Congress Catalogue Card Number 76-165987\r\nStandard Book Number 0-87821-036-9\r\n\r\nPrinted in the U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MY FATHER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was stimulated to write these Outlines of Greek and Roman Medicine by\r\na recent sojourn in the south-eastern part of Europe. The name of the\r\nbook defines, to some extent, its limitations, for my desire has been to\r\ngive merely a general outline of the most important stages in the\r\nadvancement of the healing art in the two Empires to which modern\r\ncivilization is most deeply indebted. There are a few great works on the\r\nhistory of medicine by continental writers, such, for instance, as those\r\nby the German writers, Baas, Sprengel, and Puschmann, but, generally\r\nspeaking, the subject has been much neglected.\r\n\r\nI cherish the hope that this little work may appeal to doctors, to\r\nmedical students, and to those of the public who are interested in a\r\nnarration of the progress of knowledge, and who realize that the\r\ninvestigation of the body in health and disease has been one of the most\r\nimportant features of human endeavour.\r\n\r\nThe medical profession deserves censure for neglect of its own history,\r\nand pity 'tis that so many practitioners know nothing of the story of\r\ntheir art. For this reason many reputed discoveries are only\r\nre-discoveries; as Bacon wrote: \"Medicine is a science which hath been,\r\nas we have said, more professed than laboured, and yet more laboured\r\nthan advanced; the labour having been, in my judgment, rather in circle\r\nthan in progression. For I find much iteration, and small progression.\"\r\nOf late years, however, the History of Medicine has been coming into its\r\nkingdom. Universities are establishing courses of lectures on the\r\nsubject, and the Royal Society of Medicine recently instituted a\r\nhistorical section.\r\n\r\nThe material I have used in this book has been gathered from many\r\nsources, and, as far as possible, references have been given, but I have\r\nsought for, and taken, information wherever it could best be found. As\r\nMontaigne wrote: \"I have here only made a nosegay of culled flowers, and\r\nhave brought nothing of my own but the thread that ties them together.\"\r\n\r\nI have to express my indebtedness to my friend, Mr. J. Scott Riddell,\r\nM.V.O., M.A., M.B., C.M., Senior Surgeon, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, for\r\nhis great kindness in reading the proof-sheets, preparing the index and\r\nseeing this book through the press and so removing one of the\r\ndifficulties which an author writing overseas has to encounter; also to\r\nmy publishers for their courtesy and attention.\r\n\r\nJAMES SANDS

Medicine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nEARLY ROMAN MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n     Origin of Healing--Temples--Lectisternium--Temple of\r\n     Æsculapius--Archagathus--Domestic Medicine--Greek Doctors--Cloaca\r\n     Maxima--Aqueducts--State of the early Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the healing art in Ancient Rome is shrouded in\r\nuncertainty. The earliest practice of medicine was undoubtedly theurgic,\r\nand common to all primitive peoples. The offices of priest and of\r\nmedicine-man were combined in one person, and magic was invoked to take\r\nthe place of knowledge. There is much scope for the exercise of the\r\nimagination in attempting to follow the course of early man in his\r\nefforts to bring plants into medicinal use. That some of the indigenous\r\nplants had therapeutic properties was often an accidental discovery,\r\nleading in the next place to experiment and observation. Cornelius\r\nAgrippa, in his book on occult philosophy, states that mankind has\r\nlearned the use of many remedies from animals. It has even been\r\nsuggested that the use of the enema was discovered by observing a\r\nlong-beaked bird drawing up water into its beak, and injecting the water\r\ninto the bowel. The practice of healing, crude and imperfect, progressed\r\nslowly in ancient times and was conducted in much the same way in Rome,\r\nand among the Egyptians, the Jews, the Chaldeans, Hindus and Parsees,\r\nand the Chinese and Tartars.\r\n\r\nThe Etruscans had considerable proficiency in philosophy and medicine,\r\nand to this people, as well as to the Sabines, the Ancient Romans were\r\nindebted for knowledge. Numa Pompilius, of Sabine origin, who was King\r\nof Rome 715 B.C., studied physical science, and, as Livy relates, was\r\nstruck by lightning and killed as the result of his experiments, and it\r\nhas therefore been inferred that these experiments related to the\r\ninvestigation of electricity. It is surprising to find in the Twelve\r\nTables of Numa references to dental operations. In early times, it is\r\ncertain that the Romans were more prone to learn the superstitions of\r\nother peoples than to acquire much useful knowledge. They were\r\ncosmopolitan in medical art as in religion. They had acquaintance with\r\nthe domestic medicine known to all savages, a little rude surgery, and\r\nprescriptions from the Sibylline books, and had much recourse to magic.\r\nIt was to Greece that the Romans first owed their knowledge of healing,\r\nand of art and science generally, but at no time did the Romans equal\r\nthe Greeks in mental culture.\r\n\r\nPliny states that \"the Roman people for more than six hundred years were\r\nnot, indeed, without medicine, but they were without physicians.\" They\r\nused traditional family recipes, and had numerous gods and goddesses of\r\ndisease and healing. Febris was the god of fever, Mephitis the god of\r\nstench; Fessonia aided the weary, and \"Sweet Cloacina\" presided over the\r\ndrains. The plague-stricken appealed to the goddess Angeronia, women to\r\nFluonia and Uterina. Ossipaga took care of the bones of children, and\r\nCarna was the deity presiding over the abdominal organs.\r\n\r\nTemples were erected in Rome in 467 B.C. in honour of Apollo, the\r\nreputed father of Æsculapius, and in 460 B.C. in honour of Æsculapius of\r\nEpidaurus. Ten years later a pestilence raged in the city, and a temple\r\nwas built in honour of the Goddess Salus. By order of the Sibylline\r\nbooks, in 399 B.C., the first _lectisternium_ was held in Rome to combat\r\na pestilence. This was a festival of Greek origin. It was a time of\r\nprayer and sacrifice; the images of the gods were laid upon a couch, and\r\na meal was spread on a table before them. These festivals were repeated\r\nas occasion demanded, and the device of driving a nail into the temple\r\nof Jupiter to ward off \"the pestilence that walketh in darkness,\" and\r\n\"destruction that wasteth at noonday\" was begun 360 B.C. As evidence of\r\nthe want of proper surgical knowledge, the fact is recorded by Livy\r\nthat after the Battle of Sutrium (309 B.C.) more soldiers died of wounds\r\nthan were killed in action. The worship of Æsculapius was begun by the\r\nRomans 291 B.C., and the Egyptian Isis and Serapis were also invoked for\r\ntheir healing powers.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the great plague in Rome (291 B.C.), ambassadors were\r\nsent to Epidaurus, in accordance with the advice of the Sibylline books,\r\nto seek aid from Æsculapius. They returned with a statue of the god, but\r\nas their boat passed up the Tiber a serpent which had lain concealed\r\nduring the voyage glided from the boat, and landing on the bank was\r\nwelcomed by the people in the belief that the god himself had come to\r\ntheir aid. The Temple of Æsculapius, which was built after this plague\r\nin 291 B.C., was situated on the island of the Tiber. Tradition states\r\nthat, when the Tarquins were expelled, their crops were thrown into the\r\nriver, and soil accumulated thereon until ultimately the island was\r\nformed. In consequence of the strange happening of the serpent landing\r\nfrom the ship the end of the island on which the Temple of Æsculapius\r\nstood was shaped into the form of the bow of a ship, and the serpent of\r\nÆsculapius was sculptured upon it in relief.\r\n\r\nThe island is not far from the Æmilian Bridge, of which one broken arch\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nOvid represents this divinity as speaking thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"I come to leave my shrine;\r\n    This serpent view, that with ambitious play\r\n    My staff encircles, mark him every way;\r\n    His form--though larger, nobler, I'll assume,\r\n    And, changed as gods should be, bring aid to Rome.\"\r\n\r\n(Ovid, \"Metamorphoses,\" xv.)\r\n\r\nHe is said to have resumed his natural form on the island of the Tiber.\r\n\r\n    \"And now no more the drooping city mourns;\r\n    Joy is again restored and health returns.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the custom for patients to sleep under the portico of the Temple\r\nof Æsculapius, hoping that the god of the healing art might inspire them\r\nin dreams as to the system of cure they should adopt for their\r\nillnesses. Sick slaves were left there by their masters, but the number\r\nincreased to such an extent that the Emperor Claudius put a stop to the\r\ncruel practice. The Church of St. Bartholomew now stands on the ruins of\r\nthe Temple of Æsculapius.\r\n\r\nEven in very early times, however, Rome was not without medical\r\npractitioners, though not so well supplied as some other nations. The\r\nLex Æmilia, passed 433 B.C., ordained punishment for the doctor who\r\nneglected a sick slave. In Plutarch's \"Life of Cato\" (the Censor, who\r\nwas born in 234 B.C.), we read of a Roman ambassador who was sent to the\r\nKing of Bithynia, in Asia Minor, and who had his skull trepanned.\r\n\r\nThe first regular doctor in Rome was Archagathus, who began practice in\r\nthe city 219 B.C., when the authorities received him favourably and\r\nbought a surgery for him; but his methods were rather violent, and he\r\nmade much use of the knife and caustics, earning for himself the title\r\nof \"butcher,\" and thus having fallen into disfavour, he was glad to\r\ndepart from Rome. A College of Æsculapius and of Health was established\r\n154 B.C., but this was not a teaching college in the present meaning of\r\nthe term.\r\n\r\nThe doctors of Ancient Rome took no regular course of study, nor were\r\nany standards specified, but as a rule knowledge was acquired by\r\npupilage to a practising physician, for which a honorarium was paid.\r\nSubsequently the Archiatri, after the manner of trade guilds, received\r\napprentices, but Pliny had cause to complain of the system of medical\r\neducation, or rather, to deplore the want of it. He wrote: \"People\r\nbelieved in anyone who gave himself out for a doctor, even if the\r\nfalsehood directly entailed the greatest danger. Unfortunately, there is\r\nno law which punishes doctors for ignorance, and no one takes revenge on\r\na doctor if through his fault someone dies. It is permitted him by our\r\ndanger to learn for the future, at our death to make experiments, and,\r\nwithout having to fear punishment, to set at naught the life of a human\r\nbeing.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the time when Greek doctors settled in Rome, medical treatment\r\nwas mainly under the direct charge of the head of each household. The\r\nfather of a family had great powers conferred upon him by the Roman law,\r\nand was physician as well as judge over his family. If he took his\r\nnew-born infant in his arms he recognized him as his son, but otherwise\r\nthe child had no claim upon him. He could inflict the most dire\r\npunishments on members of his household for which they had no redress.\r\n\r\nCato, the Elder, who died in B.C. 149, wrote a guide to domestic\r\nmedicine for the use of Roman fathers of the Republic, but he was a\r\nquack and full of self-conceit. He hated the physicians practising in\r\nRome, who were mostly Greeks, and thought that their knowledge was much\r\ninferior to his own. Plutarch relates that Cato knew of the answer given\r\nto the King of Persia by Hippocrates, when sent for professionally, \"I\r\nwill never make use of my art in favour of barbarians who are enemies of\r\nthe Greeks,\" and pretended to believe that all Greek physicians were\r\nbound by the same rule, and animated by the same motives. However, Cato\r\ndid a great deal of good by attempting to lessen the vice and luxury of\r\nhis age.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks in Rome were looked at askance as foreign adventurers, and\r\nthere is no doubt that although many were honourable men, others came to\r\nRome merely to make money out of the superstitious beliefs and credulity\r\nof the Roman people. Fine clothes, a good house, and the giving of\r\nentertainments, were the best introduction to practice that some of\r\nthese practitioners could devise.\r\n\r\nThe medical opinions of Cato throw a sidelight upon the state of\r\nmedicine in his time. He attempted to cure dislocations by uttering a\r\nnonsensical incantation: \"_Huat hanat ista pista sista damiato\r\ndamnaustra!_\" He considered ducks, geese and hares a light and suitable\r\ndiet for the sick, and had no faith in fasting.\r\n\r\nAlthough the darkness was prolonged and intense before the dawn of\r\nmedical science in Rome, yet, in ancient times, there was a considerable\r\namount of knowledge of sanitation. The great sewer of Rome, the _Cloaca\r\nMaxima_, which drained the swampy valley between the Capitoline and\r\nPalatine Hills, was built by order of Tarquinius Priscus in 616 B.C. It\r\nis wonderful that at the present time the visitor may see this ancient\r\nwork in the Roman Forum, and trace its course to the Tiber. In the\r\nForum, too, to the left of the Temple of Castor, is the sacred district\r\nof Juturna, the nymph of the healing springs which well up at the base\r\nof the Palatine Hill. _Lacus Juturnæ_ is a four-sided basin with a\r\npillar in the middle, on which rested a marble altar decorated with\r\nfigures in relief. Beside the basin are rooms for religious purposes.\r\nThese rooms are adorned with the gods of healing, Æsculapius with an\r\nacolyte holding a cock, the Dioscuri and their horses, the head of\r\nSerapis, and a headless statue of Apollo.\r\n\r\nThe Cloaca Maxima was formed of three tiers of arches, the vault within\r\nthe innermost tier being 14 ft. in diameter. The administration of the\r\nsewers, in the time of the Republic, was in the hands of the censors,\r\nbut special officers called _curatores cloacarum_ were employed during\r\nthe Empire, and the workmen who repaired and cleansed the sewers were\r\ncondemned criminals. These ancient sewers, which have existed for\r\ntwenty-five centuries, are monuments to the wisdom and power of the\r\npeople who built them. In the time of Furius Camillus private drains\r\nwere connected with the public sewers which were flushed by aqueduct and\r\nrain water. This system has prevailed throughout the centuries.\r\n\r\nThe Aqueducts were also marvellous works, and although they were added\r\nto in the time of the Empire, Sextus Julius Frontinus, curator of waters\r\nin the year A.D. 94, gives descriptions of the nine ancient aqueducts,\r\nsome of which were constructed long before the Empire. For instance, the\r\n_Aqua Appia_ was conducted into the city three hundred and twelve years\r\nbefore the advent of Christ, and was about seven miles long. The _Aqua\r\nAnio Vetus_, sixty-two miles in length, built in B.C. 144, was conveyed\r\nacross the Campagna from a source in the country beyond Tivoli. Near\r\nthis place there is a spring of milky-looking water containing\r\nsulphurous acid, sulphurated lime, and bicarbonate of lime, used now,\r\nand in ancient times for the relief of skin complaints. This water, at\r\nthe present day, has an almost constant temperature of 75°.\r\n\r\nIn course of time, when the Roman power was being extended abroad, the\r\npursuit of conquest left little scope for the cultivation of the\r\npeaceful arts and the investigation of science, and life itself was\r\naccounted so cheap that little thought was given to improving methods\r\nfor the treatment of the sick and wounded. On a campaign every soldier\r\ncarried on his person a field-dressing, and the wounded received\r\nrough-and-ready first-aid attention from their comrades in arms.\r\n\r\nLater, when conquest was ended, and attention was given to the\r\nconsolidation of the provinces, ease and happiness, as has been shown by\r\nGibbon, tended to the decay of courage and thus to lessen the prowess of\r\nthe Roman legions, but there was compensation for this state of affairs\r\nat the heart of the Empire because strong streams of capable and robust\r\nrecruits flowed in from Spain, Gaul, Britain and Illyricum.\r\n\r\nAt its commencement, the Empire was in a peaceful, and, on the whole,\r\nprosperous condition, and the provincials, as well as the Romans,\r\n\"acknowledged that the true principles of social life, laws,\r\nagriculture, and science, which had been first invented by the wisdom of\r\nAthens, were now firmly established by the power of Rome, under whose\r\nauspicious influence the fiercest barbarians were united by an equal\r\ngovernment and common language. They affirm that with the improvement of\r\narts the human species was visibly multiplied. They celebrate the\r\nincreasing splendour of the cities, the beautiful face of the country,\r\ncultivated and adorned like an immense garden; and the long festival of\r\npeace, which was enjoyed by so many nations, forgetful of their ancient\r\nanimosities, and delivered from the apprehension of future danger.\" Thus\r\nwrote the Roman historian, and Gibbon states that when we discount as\r\nmuch of this as we please as rhetorical and declamatory, the fact\r\nremains that the substance of this description is in accordance with the\r\nfacts of history. Never until the Christian era was any thought given to\r\nthe regular care of the helpless and the abject. Slaves were often\r\ntreated like cattle, and the patricians had no bond of sympathy with the\r\nplebeians. Provisions were sometimes distributed to the poor, and taxes\r\nremitted, but for reasons of State and not from truly charitable\r\nmotives. Authority was also given to parents to destroy new-born infants\r\nwhom they could not support. The idea of establishing public\r\ninstitutions for the relief of the sick and the poor did not enter the\r\nminds of the ancient Romans.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the state of the healing art throughout the period of\r\nthe Roman Empire, it is necessary to devote the next chapters to a\r\nconsideration of the rise and progress of medical science in Greece,\r\nfor it cannot be too strongly emphasized that Roman philosophy and Roman\r\nmedicine were borrowed from the Greeks, and it is certain also that the\r\nGreeks were indebted to the Egyptians for part of their medical\r\nknowledge. The Romans were distinguished for their genius for law-giving\r\nand government, the Greeks for philosophy, art, and mental culture\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate I.

In the \"Iliad\" he is hailed as\r\nthe disperser of epidemics, and, in this respect, the ancients were well\r\ninformed in attributing destruction of infection to the sun's rays.\r\nChiron, the Centaur, it was believed, was taught by Apollo and Artemis,\r\nand was the teacher, in turn, of Æsculapius, who probably lived in the\r\nthirteenth century before Christ and was ultimately deified as the Greek\r\ngod of medicine. Pindar relates of him:--\r\n\r\n    \"On some the force of charmèd strains he tried,\r\n    To some the medicated draught applied;\r\n    Some limbs he placed the amulets around,\r\n    Some from the trunk he cut, and made the patient sound.\"[1]\r\n\r\nÆsculapius was too successful in his art, for his death was attributed\r\nto Zeus, who killed him by a flash of lightning, or to Pluto, both of\r\nwhom were thought to have feared that Æsculapius might by his skill gain\r\nthe mastery over death.\r\n\r\nAmid much that is mythological in the history of Æsculapius, there is a\r\ngroundwork of facts. Splendid temples were built to him in lovely and\r\nhealthy places, usually on a hill or near a spring; they were visited by\r\nthe sick, and the priests of the temples not only attended to the\r\nworship of Æsculapius, but took pains to acquire knowledge of the\r\nhealing art. The chief temple was at Epidaurus, and here the patients\r\nwere well provided with amusements, for close to the temple was a\r\ntheatre capable of seating 12,000 people, and a stadium built to\r\naccommodate 20,000 spectators.\r\n\r\nA serpent entwined round a knotted staff is the symbol of Æsculapius. A\r\nhumorist of the present day has suggested that the knots on the staff\r\nindicate the numerous \"knotty\" questions which a doctor is asked to\r\nsolve! Tradition states that when Æsculapius was in the house of his\r\npatient, Glaucus, and deep in thought, a serpent coiled itself around\r\nhis staff. Æsculapius killed it, and then another serpent appeared with\r\na herb leaf in its mouth, and restored the dead reptile to life. It\r\nseems probable that disease was looked upon as a poison. Serpents\r\nproduced poison, and had a reputation in the most ancient times for\r\nwisdom, and for the power of renovation, and it was thought that a\r\ncreature which could produce poison and disease might probably be\r\ncapable of curing as well as killing. Serpents were kept in the Temples\r\nof Æsculapius, and were non-poisonous and harmless. They were given\r\ntheir liberty in the precincts of the temple, but were provided with a\r\nserpent-house or den near to the altar. They were worshipped as the\r\nincarnation of the god, and were fed by the sick at the altar with\r\n\"popana,\" or sacrificial cakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wellcome's Medical Diary (Copyright) By permission\r\nof Burroughs Wellcome & Co.\r\n\r\nPlate II.--HYGEIA\r\n\r\nThe Greek Deity of Health.]\r\n\r\nMany of the Greek gods and goddesses were held to have power over\r\ndisease. Hygeia, known as Salus to the Romans, was said to have been the\r\ndaughter of Æsculapius, and to have taken care of the sacred serpents\r\n(Plate II).\r\n\r\nMelampus was considered by the Greeks the first mortal to practise\r\nhealing. In one case he prescribed rust, probably the earliest use of\r\niron as a drug, and he also used hellebore root as a purgative. He\r\nmarried a princess and was given part of a kingdom as a reward for his\r\nservices. After his death he was awarded divine honours, and temples\r\nwere erected for his worship. The deification of Æsculapius and of\r\nMelampus added much to the prestige of doctors in Greece, where they\r\nwere always held in honour; but in Rome the practice of medicine was not\r\nconsidered a highly honourable calling.\r\n\r\nSomething can be learned from the writings of Homer of the state of\r\nmedicine in his time, although we need hardly expect to find in an epic\r\npoem many references to diseases and their cure. As dissection was\r\nconsidered a profanation of the body, anatomical knowledge was\r\nexceedingly meagre. Machaon was surgeon to Menelaus and Podalarius was\r\nthe pioneer of phlebotomy. Both were regarded as the sons of Æsculapius;\r\nthey were soldiers as well as doctors, and fought before the walls of\r\nTroy. The surgery required by Homer's heroes was chiefly that of the\r\nbattlefield. Unguents and astringents were in use in the physician's\r\nart, and there is reference to \"nepenthe,\" a narcotic drug, and also to\r\nthe use of sulphur as a disinfectant. Doctors, according to Homer, were\r\nheld in high esteem, and Arctinus relates that two divisions were\r\nrecognized, surgeons and physicians, the former held in less honour than\r\nthe latter--\"Then Asclepius (Æsculapius) bestowed the power of healing\r\nupon his two sons; nevertheless, he made one of the two more celebrated\r\nthan the other; on one did he bestow the lighter hand that he might draw\r\nmissiles from the flesh, and sew up and heal all wounds; but the other\r\nhe endowed with great precision of mind, so as to understand what cannot\r\nbe seen, and to heal seemingly incurable diseases.\"[2]\r\n\r\nMachaon fought in the army of Nestor. Fearing for his safety, King\r\nIdomeneus placed him under the charge of Nestor, who was instructed to\r\ntake the doctor into his chariot, for \"a doctor is worth many men.\" When\r\nMenelaus was wounded, a messenger was sent for Machaon, who extracted\r\nthe barbed arrow, sucked the wound and applied a secret ointment made\r\nknown to Æsculapius by Chiron the Centaur, according to tradition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wellcome's Medical Diary (Copyright) By permission\r\nof Burroughs Wellcome & Co.\r\n\r\nMACHAON (SON OF ASKLEPIOS),\r\n\r\nThe first Greek military surgeon, attending to the wounded Menelaus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Wellcome's Medical Diary (Copyright) Permission of\r\nBurroughs Wellcome & Co.\r\n\r\nPlate III.-FACADE OF TEMPLE OF ASKLEPIOS--RESTORED (Delfrasse).]\r\n\r\nThe practice of Greek medicine became almost entirely restricted to the\r\ntemples of Æsculapius, the most important of which were situated at\r\nRhodes, Cnidus and Cos. The priests were known as Asclepiadæ, but the\r\nname was applied in time to the healers of the temple who were not\r\npriests. Tablets were affixed to the walls of these temples recording\r\nthe name of the patient, the disease and the cure prescribed. There is\r\nevidence that diseases were closely observed. The patients brought gifts\r\nto the temples, and underwent a preliminary purification by ablutions,\r\nfasting, prayer and sacrifice. A cock was a common sacrifice to the god.\r\nNo doubt many wonderful cures were effected. Mental suggestion was used\r\ngreatly, and the patient was put to sleep, his cure being often revealed\r\nto him in a dream which was interpreted by the priests. The expectancy\r\nof his mind, and the reduced state of his body as the result of\r\nabstinence conduced to a cure, and trickery also played a minor part.\r\nAlbeit, much of the treatment prescribed was commendable. Pure air,\r\ncheerful surroundings, proper diet and temperate habits were advocated,\r\nand, among other methods of treatment, exercise, massage, sea-bathing,\r\nthe use of mineral waters, purgatives and emetics, and hemlock as a\r\nsedative, were in use. If a cure was not effected, the faith of the\r\npatient was impugned, and not the power of the god or the skill of the\r\nAsclepiades, so that neither religion nor the practice of physic was\r\nexposed to discredit. Great was the wisdom of the Greeks! These temples\r\nwere the famous medical schools of ancient Greece. A spirit of\r\nemulation prevailed, and a high ethical standard was attained, as is\r\nshown by the oath prescribed for students when they completed their\r\ncourse of study. The form of oath will be found in a succeeding chapter\r\nin connection with an account of the life of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IV.--HEALTH TEMPLE--RESTORED (Caton).\r\n\r\n_Face p. 20._]\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Health Temple, or Asklepieion, of Cos were brought to\r\nlight in 1904 and 1905, by the work of Dr. Rudolf Herzog, of Tübingen.\r\nDr. Richard Caton, of Liverpool, has been able to reconstruct\r\npictorially the beautiful buildings that existed two thousand years ago.\r\nThey were situated among the hills. The sacred groves of cypresses were\r\non three sides of the temple, and \"to the north the verdant plain of\r\nCos, with the white houses and trees of the town to the right, and the\r\nwide expanse of turquoise sea dotted by the purple islands of the Ægean,\r\nand the dim mountains about Halicarnassus, to the north-east.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greek Gymnasia were in use long before the Asclepiades began\r\nto practise in the temples. The Greeks were a healthy and strong race,\r\nmainly because they attended to physical culture as a national duty. The\r\nattendants who massaged the bodies of the athletes were called _aliptæ_,\r\nand they also taught physical exercises, and practised minor surgery and\r\nmedicine. Massage was used before and after exercises in the gymnasium,\r\nand was performed by anointing the body with a mixture of oil and sand\r\nwhich was well rubbed into the skin. There were three classes of\r\nofficials in the gymnasia; the director or magistrate called the\r\n_gymnasiarch_, the sub-director or _gymnast_, and the subordinates. The\r\ndirectors regulated the diet of the young men, the _sub-directors_,\r\nbesides other duties, prescribed for the sick, and the attendants\r\nmassaged, bled, dressed wounds, gave clysters, and treated abscesses,\r\ndislocations, &c.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the Greeks, in insisting upon the physical\r\ntraining of the young, were wiser in their generation than the people of\r\nthe present day; and not only the young, but people of mature age, took\r\nexercises suited to their physical requirements. The transgression of\r\nsome of Solon's laws in reference to the gymnasia was punishable by\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe third stage in the history of Greek medicine has now been reached.\r\nThe first stage was primitive, the second associated with religion, and\r\nthe third connected with philosophy. The classification of Renouard is\r\naccurate and convenient. In the \"Age of Foundation,\" he recognizes four\r\nperiods, namely:--\r\n\r\n(1) The Primitive Period, or that of Instinct, beginning with myth, and\r\nending with the destruction of Troy, 1184 years before Christ.\r\n\r\n(2) The Sacred or Mystic Period, ending with the dispersion of the\r\nPythagorean Society, 500 years before Christ.\r\n\r\n(3) The Philosophic Period, ending with the foundation of the\r\nAlexandrian library, 320 years before Christ. This period is made\r\nillustrious by Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n(4) The Anatomic Period, ending with the death of Galen, about 200 years\r\nafter Christ.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Greek medical philosopher was Pythagoras (about 580 B.C.).\r\nHe was born at Samos, and began life as an athlete, but a lecture which\r\nhe heard on the subject of the immortality of the soul kindled\r\nenthusiasm for philosophical study, the pursuit of which led him to\r\nvisit Egypt, Phoenicia, Chaldea, and perhaps also India. He was imbued\r\nwith Eastern mysticism, and held that the air is full of spiritual\r\nbeings who send dreams to men, and health or disease to mankind and to\r\nthe lower animals. He did not remain long in Greece, but travelled much,\r\nand settled for a considerable time in Crotona, in the South of Italy,\r\nwhere he taught pupils, their course of study extending over five or six\r\nyears. The Pythagorean Society founded by him did much good at first,\r\nbut its members ultimately became greedy of gain and dishonest, and the\r\nSociety in the lifetime of its founder was subjected to persecution and\r\ndispersed by angry mobs. Pythagoras possessed a prodigious mind. He is\r\nbest known for his teaching in reference to the transmigration of\r\nsouls, but he was also a great mathematician and astronomer. He taught\r\nthat \"number is the essence of everything,\" and his philosophy\r\nrecognized that the universe is governed by law. God he represented by\r\nthe figure 1, matter by the figure 2, and the universe by the\r\ncombination 12, all of which, though fanciful, was an improvement upon\r\nmythology, and a recognition of system.\r\n\r\nIn the practice of medicine he promoted health mainly by diet and\r\ngymnastics, advised music for depression of spirits, and had in use\r\nvarious vegetable drugs. He introduced oxymel of squills from Egypt into\r\nGreece, and was a strong believer in the medicinal properties of onions.\r\nHe viewed surgery with disfavour, and used only salves and poultices.\r\nThe Asclepiades treated patients in the temples, but the Pythagoreans\r\nvisited from house to house, and from city to city, and were known as\r\nthe ambulant or periodic physicians.\r\n\r\nHerodotus gives an account of another eminent physician of Crotona,\r\n_Democedes_ by name, who succeeded Pythagoras. At this time, it is\r\nrecorded that the various cities had public medical officers. Democedes\r\ngained his freedom from slavery as a reward for curing the wife of\r\nDarius of an abscess in the breast.\r\n\r\nThe dispersal of the Pythagoreans led to the settlement of many of them,\r\nand of their imitators, in Rome and various parts of Italy. Although\r\nPythagoras was a philosopher, he belongs to the Mystic Period, while\r\nHippocrates is the great central figure of the Philosophic Period.\r\nBefore studying the work of Hippocrates, it is necessary to consider the\r\ndistinguishing features of the various schools of Greek philosophy.\r\nRenouard shows that the principles of the various schools of medical\r\nbelief depended upon the three great Greek schools of Cosmogony.\r\n\r\nPythagoras believed in a Supreme Ruler of the Universe, and that spirits\r\nanimated all life, and existed even in minerals; he also believed in\r\npreconceived purpose. With these views were associated the Dogmatic\r\nSchool of Medicine, and the name of Hippocrates, and this belief\r\ncorresponds to modern vitalism.\r\n\r\nLeucippus and Democritus, rejecting theology, considered vital action\r\nsecondary to the operation of the laws of matter, and believed that\r\natoms moved through pores in the body in such a way as to determine a\r\nstate of health or disease. With this philosophy was associated the\r\nMedical School of Methodism, a system said to have been founded by\r\nAsclepiades of Prusa (who lived in Rome in the first century before\r\nChrist), and by his pupil Themison (B.C. 50). The third school of\r\nmedical thought, that of Empiricism, taught that experience was the only\r\nteacher, and that it was idle to speculate upon remote causes. The\r\nEmpirics based these views upon the teaching of philosophers known as\r\nSceptics or Zetetics, followers of Parmenides and Pyrrho, who taught\r\nthat it was useless to fatigue the mind in endeavouring to comprehend\r\nwhat is beyond its range. They were the precursors of modern\r\nagnosticism.\r\n\r\nThe Eclectics, in a later age, formed another medical sect, and had no\r\ndefinite system except that they made a selection of the views and\r\nmethods of Dogmatists, Methodists and Empirics.\r\n\r\nThe Greek philosophers as a class believed in a primary form of matter\r\nout of which elements were formed, and the view held in regard to the\r\nelements is expressed in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses.\"[4]\r\n\r\n    \"Nor those which elements we call abide,\r\n    Nor to this figure nor to that are ty'd:\r\n    For this eternal world is said of old\r\n    But four prolific principles to hold,\r\n    Four different bodies; two to heaven ascend,\r\n    And other two down to the centre tend.\r\n    Fire first, with wings expanded, mounts on high,\r\n    Pure, void of weight, and dwells in upper sky;\r\n    Then air, because unclogged, in empty space\r\n    Flies after fire, and claims the second place;\r\n    But weighty water, as her nature guides,\r\n    Lies on the lap of earth; and Mother Earth subsides.\r\n    All things are mixed of these, which all contain,\r\n    And into these are all resolved again.\"\r\n\r\nFire was considered to be matter in a very refined form, and to closely\r\nresemble life or even soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Wheelwright's translation of \"Pindar.\"\r\n\r\n[2] Arctinus, \"Ethiopis.\" Translated in Puschmann's \"Hist.

He belonged to the family of the\r\nAsclepiadæ, and, according to tradition, could trace his ancestors on\r\nthe male side to Æsculapius, and on the female side to Hercules. He is\r\nsaid to have received his medical education from his father and from\r\nHerodicus, and to have been taught philosophy by Gorgias, the Sophist,\r\nand by Democritus, whom he afterwards cured of mental derangement.\r\n\r\nThere was a very famous medical school at Cos, and the temple there held\r\nthe notes of the accumulated experience of his predecessors, but\r\nHippocrates visited also, for the purpose of study, various towns of\r\nGreece, and particularly Athens. He was a keen observer, and took\r\ncareful notes of his observations. His reputation was such that his\r\nworks are quoted by Plato and by Aristotle, and there are references to\r\nhim by Arabic writers. His descendants published their own writings\r\nunder his name, and there were also many forgeries, so that it is\r\nimpossible to know exactly how many of the works attributed to him are\r\nauthentic; but by a consensus of opinion the following books are\r\nconsidered genuine: \"Prognostics,\" seven of the books of \"Aphorisms,\"\r\n\"On Airs, Waters and Places,\" \"On Regimen in Acute Diseases,\" the first\r\nand third books of \"Epidemics,\" \"On the Articulations,\" \"On Fractures,\"\r\nthe treatise on \"Instruments of Reduction,\" and \"The Oath\"; and the\r\nbooks considered almost certainly genuine are those dealing with\r\n\"Ancient Medicine,\" \"Surgery,\" \"The Law,\" \"Fistulæ,\" \"Ulcers,\"\r\n\"Hæmorrhoids,\" and \"On the Sacred Disease\" (Epilepsy). The famous\r\nHippocratic Collection in the great libraries of Alexandria and Pergamos\r\nalso comprised the writings of Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nThe genius of Hippocrates is unsurpassed in the history of medicine. He\r\nwas the first to trace disease to a natural and intelligible cause, and\r\nto recognize Nature as all-sufficient for healing, and physicians as\r\nonly her servants. He discussed medical subjects freely and without an\r\nair of mystery, scorning all pretence, and he was also courageous enough\r\nto acknowledge his limitations and his failures. When the times in which\r\nhe lived are considered, it is difficult to know which of his qualities\r\nto admire most, his love of knowledge, his powers of observation, his\r\nlogical faculty, or his courage and truthfulness.\r\n\r\nThe central principle of belief of Hippocrates and the Dogmatists was\r\nthat health depended on the proper proportion and action in the body of\r\nthe four elements, earth, water, air, and fire, and the four cardinal\r\nhumours, blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. The due combination\r\nof these was known as _crasis_, and existed in health. If a disease were\r\nprogressing favourably these humours became changed and combined\r\n(coction), preparatory to the expulsion of the morbid matter (crisis),\r\nwhich took place at definite periods known as critical days. Hippocrates\r\nalso held the theory of fluxions, which were conditions in the nature of\r\ncongestion, as it would now be understood.\r\n\r\nIn his time public opinion condemned dissection of the human body, but\r\nit is certain that dissections were performed by Hippocrates to a\r\nlimited extent. He did not know the difference between the arteries and\r\nthe veins, and nerves and ligaments and various membranes were all\r\nthought to have analogous functions, but his writings display a correct\r\nknowledge of the anatomy of certain parts of the body such as the joints\r\nand the brain. This defective knowledge of anatomy gave rise to fanciful\r\nviews on physiology, which, among much that is admirable, disfigure the\r\nHippocratic writings.\r\n\r\nThe belief that almost all medical and surgical knowledge is modern,\r\nthough flattering to our self-complacency, is disturbed by the study of\r\nthe state of knowledge in the time of Hippocrates. To him we are\r\nindebted for the classification of diseases into sporadic, epidemic,\r\nand endemic, and he also separated acute from chronic diseases. He\r\ndivided the causes of disease into two classes: general, such as\r\nclimate, water and sanitation; and personal, such as improper food and\r\nneglect of exercise.\r\n\r\nHe based his conclusions on the observation of appearances, and in this\r\nway began a new era. He was so perfect in the observation of external\r\nsigns of disease that he has never in this respect been excelled. The\r\nstate of the face, eyes, tongue, voice, hearing, abdomen, sleep,\r\nbreathing, excretions, posture of the body, and so on, all aided him in\r\ndiagnosis and prognosis, and to the latter he paid special attention,\r\nsaying that \"the best physician is the one who is able to establish a\r\nprognosis, penetrating and exposing first of all, at the bedside, the\r\npresent, the past, and the future of his patients, and adding what they\r\nomit in their statements. He gains their confidence, and being convinced\r\nof his superiority of knowledge they do not hesitate to commit\r\nthemselves entirely into his hands. He can treat, also, so much better\r\ntheir present condition in proportion as he shall be able from it to\r\nforesee the future.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote about the history of Medicine, a study which is much neglected\r\nat the present time. There is no generation of men so wise that they\r\ncannot with advantage adopt some ideas from the remote past, or, at\r\nleast, find the teaching of their predecessors suggestive. Hippocrates\r\nwas one of the first to recognize the _vis medicatrix naturæ_, and he\r\nalways aimed at assisting Nature. His style of treatment would be known\r\nnow as expectant, and he tried to order his practice \"to do good, or, at\r\nleast, to do no harm.\" When he considered interference necessary,\r\nhowever, he did not hesitate even to apply drastic measures, such as\r\nscarification, cupping and bleeding. He made use of the narcotics\r\nmandragora, henbane, and probably also poppy-juice, and as a laxative\r\nused greatly a vegetable substance called \"mercury,\" beet and cabbage,\r\nand cathartics such as scammony and elaterium! He was able to diagnose\r\nfluid in the chest or abdomen by means of percussion and auscultation,\r\nand to withdraw the fluid by the operation of paracentesis, and he\r\nrecognized also that the fluid should be allowed to flow away slowly so\r\nas to minimize the risk of syncope. He operated also for empyema. In\r\nregard to the methods of Hippocrates for the physical examination of the\r\nchest it is reasonable to suppose that the Father of Medicine indirectly\r\ninspired Laennec to invent the stethoscope. Hippocrates prescribed fluid\r\ndiet for fevers, allowed the patients cold water or barley water to\r\ndrink, and recommended cold sponging for high fever. In his writings\r\nwill be found his views on apoplexy, epilepsy, phthisis, gout,\r\nerysipelas, cancer and many other diseases common at the present day.\r\n\r\nIn the province of _Surgery_, Hippocrates was surprisingly proficient,\r\nalthough he lived before the Anatomic Period. He had various lotions for\r\nthe healing of ulcers; some of these lotions were antiseptic and have\r\nbeen in use in recent times. His opinions on the treatment of fractures\r\nare sound, and he was a master in the use of splints, and considered\r\nthat it was disgraceful on the part of the surgeon to allow a broken\r\nlimb to set in a faulty position. He resected the projecting ends of the\r\nbone in the case of compound fracture. He had a very complete knowledge\r\nof the anatomy of joints, was well acquainted with hip-joint disease,\r\nand could operate upon joints. Accidents were no doubt common in the\r\ngymnasia, and practice in the treatment of fractures and dislocations\r\nextensive and of a high order of excellence. Hippocrates used the sound\r\nfor exploring the bladder, and understood the use of the speculum for\r\nexamining the rectum, and in operations for fistula and piles. He\r\nunderstood the causation of club-foot, and could cure cases of this\r\ndeformity by bandaging. He was skilful also in obstetric operations. He\r\ntrepanned the skull, which appears to have been a common operation in\r\nhis day. He had clear and sound views in reference to wounds of the\r\nhead, recognizing that trivial-looking wounds of the scalp might become\r\nvery serious. Hippocrates gave directions as to the indications for\r\nusing the trepan, and warned the operator against mistaking sutures of\r\nthe cranial bones for fracture.\r\n\r\nHe did not describe amputations as generally understood, but removed\r\nlimbs at a joint for gangrene. When necessary he made use of mechanical\r\nappliances for reducing dislocations, and recommended doctors to furnish\r\ntheir surgeries with an adjustable table, fitted with levers, for\r\ndealing with the reduction of dislocations, and for various other\r\nsurgical manipulations. Excision of tumours was not a common operation\r\nof Hippocratic surgery, although it had been a part of Hindu practice in\r\nvery ancient times. On the subject of _Obstetrics_, Hippocrates wrote a\r\ngreat deal, and although many of his theories seem absurd at the present\r\nday, yet, on the whole, the treatment he recommends is efficacious.\r\nRegarding _Gynæcology_, in his treatise on \"Airs, Water and Places,\" it\r\nis interesting to observe that he says that the drinking of impure water\r\nwill cause dropsy of the uterus. Adams, commenting on this, has in mind\r\nhydatids, but it is evident that both Hippocrates and his translator and\r\ncritic have mistaken hydatidiform disease of the ovum for hydatid\r\ndisease of the womb. In the books which are considered genuine the\r\nreferences to diseases of women are meagre, and it is likely that the\r\nauthor had little special knowledge of the subject. That part of the\r\nHippocratic collection which is not considered genuine deals rather\r\nfully with the subject of gynæcology.[5] In it are described sounds\r\nmade of wood and of lead, dilators and uterine catheters. Sitz baths\r\nwere in use, and fumigations were very extensively employed in\r\ngynæcological practice. Pessaries were made by rolling lint or wool into\r\nan oblong shape, and were medicated to be emollient, astringent or\r\npurgative in their local action. The half of a pomegranate was used as a\r\nmechanical pessary, and there are also references to tents, and to\r\nsuppositories for the bowel.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with _Dietetics_, Hippocrates displays close observation and\r\nsound judgment. The views held generally at the present day coincide\r\nclosely with his instructions on food and feeding. In the treatise on\r\nAncient Medicine, he states that men had to find from experience the\r\nproperties of various vegetable foods, and discovered that what was\r\nsuitable in health was unsuitable in sickness, and that the accumulation\r\nof these discoveries was the origin of the art of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe Sydenham Society initiated, and Dr. Adams brilliantly accomplished,\r\na noble work in the publication in 1849 of \"The Genuine Works of\r\nHippocrates,\" from which \"The Law,\" and \"The Oath\" are here quoted. The\r\nformer is the view of Hippocrates of the standards which should govern\r\nthe practice of medicine; the latter is that by which all the\r\nÆsculapians were bound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE LAW.\r\n\r\n\"(1) Medicine is of all the arts the most noble; but, owing to the\r\nignorance of those who practise it, and of those who, inconsiderately,\r\nform a judgment of them, it is at present far behind all the other arts.\r\nTheir mistake appears to me to arise principally from this, that in the\r\ncities there is no punishment connected with the practice of medicine\r\n(and with it alone) except disgrace, and that does not hurt those who\r\nare familiar with it. Such persons are like the figures which are\r\nintroduced in tragedies, for as they have the shape, and dress, and\r\npersonal appearance of an actor, but are not actors, so also physicians\r\nare many in title but very few in reality.\r\n\r\n\"(2) Whoever is to acquire a competent knowledge of medicine, ought to\r\nbe possessed of the following advantages: A natural disposition;\r\ninstruction; a favourable position for the study; early tuition; love of\r\nlabour; leisure. First of all, a natural talent is required, for, when\r\nNature opposes, everything else is vain; but when Nature leads the way\r\nto what is most excellent, instruction in the art takes place, which the\r\nstudent must try to appropriate to himself by reflection, becoming an\r\nearly pupil in a place well adapted for instruction. He must also bring\r\nto the task a love of labour and perseverance, so that the instruction\r\ntaking root may bring forth proper and abundant fruits.\r\n\r\n\"(3) Instruction in medicine is like the culture of the productions of\r\nthe earth. For our natural disposition is, as it were, the soil; the\r\ntenets of our teacher are, as it were, the seed; instruction in youth is\r\nlike the planting of the seed in the ground at the proper season; the\r\nplace where the instruction is communicated is like the food imparted to\r\nvegetables by the atmosphere; diligent study is like the cultivation of\r\nthe fields; and it is time which imparts strength to all things and\r\nbrings them to maturity.\r\n\r\n\"(4) Having brought all these requisites to the study of medicine, and\r\nhaving acquired a true knowledge of it, we shall thus, in travelling\r\nthrough the cities, be esteemed physicians not only in name but in\r\nreality. But inexperience is a bad treasure, and a bad friend to those\r\nwho possess it, whether in opinion or reality, being devoid of\r\nself-reliance and contentedness, and the nurse both of timidity and\r\naudacity. For timidity betrays a want of powers, and audacity a want of\r\nskill. There are, indeed, two things, knowledge and opinion, of which\r\nthe one makes its possessor really to know, the other to be ignorant.\r\n\r\n\"(5) These things which are sacred are to be imparted only to sacred\r\npersons; and it is not lawful to impart them to the profane until they\r\nhave been initiated in the mysteries of the science.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE OATH.\r\n\r\n\"I swear by Apollo, the physician, and Æsculapius, and Health, and\r\nPanacea, and all the gods and goddesses, that, according to my ability\r\nand judgment, I will keep this oath and this stipulation--to reckon him\r\nwho taught me this art equally dear to me as my parents, to share my\r\nsubstance with him, and relieve his necessities if required; to look\r\nupon his offspring in the same footing as my own brothers, and to teach\r\nthem this art, if they shall wish to learn it, without fee or\r\nstipulation; and that by precept, lecture, and every other mode of\r\ninstruction, I will impart a knowledge of the Art to my own sons, and\r\nthose of my teachers, and to disciples bound by a stipulation and oath\r\naccording to the law of medicine, but to none others. I will follow that\r\nsystem of regimen which, according to my ability and judgment, I\r\nconsider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever is\r\ndeleterious and mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if\r\nasked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner I will not give\r\nto a woman a pessary to produce abortion. With purity and with holiness\r\nI will pass my life and practise my Art. I will not cut persons\r\nlabouring under the stone, but will leave this to be done by men who\r\nare practitioners of this work. Into whatever houses I enter, I will go\r\ninto them for the benefit of the sick, and will abstain from every\r\nvoluntary act of mischief and corruption, and, further, from the\r\nseduction of females or males, of freedmen and slaves. Whatever, in\r\nconnection with my professional practice, or not in connection with it,\r\nI see or hear, in the life of men, which ought not to be spoken of\r\nabroad, I will not divulge as reckoning that all such should be kept\r\nsecret. While I continue to keep this Oath inviolate, may it be granted\r\nto me to enjoy life and the practice of the Art, respected by all men,\r\nin all times! But should I trespass or violate this oath, may the\r\nreverse be my lot!\"\r\n\r\nIt would be a great task to attempt anything like a full review of the\r\nwritings of this great doctor of antiquity, but enough has been written\r\nto reveal the great powers of his mind, and to show that he was far in\r\nadvance of his predecessors, and a model for his successors. In the\r\nisland of Cos, made illustrious by the name of Hippocrates, it is\r\nstrange to find that he has no fame now other than that of being\r\nregarded in the confused minds of the people as one of the numerous\r\nsaints of the Greek Church.[6]\r\n\r\n\"When,\" says Littré, \"one searches into the history of medicine and the\r\ncommencement of science, the first body of doctrine that one meets with\r\nis the collection of writings known under the name of the works of\r\nHippocrates. The science mounts up directly to that origin, and there\r\nstops. Not that it had not been cultivated earlier, and had not given\r\nrise to even numerous productions; but everything that had been made\r\nbefore the physician of Cos has perished. We have only remaining of them\r\nscattered and unconnected fragments. The works of Hippocrates have alone\r\nescaped destruction; and by a singular circumstance there exists a great\r\ngap after them as well as before them. The medical works from\r\nHippocrates to the establishment of the School of Alexandria, and those\r\nof that school itself, are completely lost, except some quotations and\r\npassages preserved in the later writers; so that the writings of\r\nHippocrates remain alone amongst the ruins of ancient medical\r\nliterature.\" Sydenham said of Hippocrates: \"He it is whom we can never\r\nduly praise,\" and refers to him as \"that divine old man,\" and \"the\r\nRomulus of medicine, whose heaven was the empyrean of his art.\"\r\n\r\nHippocrates died in Thessaly, but at what age is uncertain, for\r\ndifferent authors have credited him with a lifetime of from eighty-five\r\nto a hundred and nine years. By virtue of his fame, death for him was\r\nnot the Great Leveller.\r\n\r\nHippocrates had two sons, Thessalus and Draco; the former was physician\r\nto Archelaus, King of Macedonia, the latter physician to the wife of\r\nAlexander the Great. They were the founders of the School of Dogmatism\r\nwhich was based mainly on the teaching and aphorisms of Hippocrates. The\r\nDogmatic Sect emphasized the importance of investigating not the obvious\r\nbut the underlying and hidden causes of disease and held undisputed sway\r\nuntil the foundation of the Empirical Sect at Alexandria.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] _Vide_ \"History of Gynæcology,\" by W.

He did not practise medicine, but studied it as a branch of\r\nphilosophy, and instead of observing and investigating, attempted to\r\nsolve the problems of health and disease by intuition and speculation.\r\nHis conceptions were inaccurate and fantastic.\r\n\r\nHe elaborated the humoral pathology of Hippocrates. The world, he\r\nthought, was composed of four elements: _fire_ consisting of pyramidal,\r\n_earth_ of cubical, _air_ of octagonal, and _water_ of twenty-sided\r\natoms. The marrow consists of triangles, and the brain is the perfection\r\nof marrow. The soul dominates the marrow and the separation of the two\r\ncauses death. The purpose of the bones and muscles is to protect the\r\nmarrow against changes of temperature. Plato divided the \"soul\" into\r\nthree parts: Reason, enthroned in the brain; courage in the heart; and\r\ndesire in the liver. The uterus, he believed, excites inordinate\r\ndesires. Inflammations are due to disorders of the bile, and fevers to\r\nthe influence of the elements. His theories in regard to the special\r\nsenses are very fantastic, for instance, smell is evanescent because it\r\nis not founded on any external image; taste results from small vessels\r\ncarrying taste atoms to the heart and soul.\r\n\r\n_Aristotle_, born B.C. 334, was the son of Nichomachus, physician to the\r\nKing of Macedonia, and of the race of the Asclepiads. His inherited\r\ntaste was for the study of Nature; he attained the great honour of being\r\nthe founder of the sciences of Comparative Anatomy and Natural History,\r\nand contributed largely to the medical knowledge of his time. Aristotle\r\nwent to Athens and became a follower of Plato, and the close\r\ncompanionship of these two great men lasted for twenty years. At the age\r\nof 42, Aristotle was appointed by Philip of Macedon tutor to Alexander\r\nthe Great, who was then aged 15, and the interest of that mighty prince\r\nwas soon aroused in the study of Natural History. Aristotle and\r\nAlexander the Great, teacher and pupil, founded the first great Natural\r\nHistory Museum, to which specimens were sent from places scattered over\r\nthe then known world. Aristotle, besides his philosophical books, wrote:\r\n\"Researches about Animals,\" \"On Sleep and Waking,\" \"On Longevity and\r\nShortlivedness,\" \"On Parts of Animals,\" \"On Respiration,\" \"On Locomotion\r\nof Animals,\" and \"On Generation of Animals.\" He was greatly helped in\r\nthe supply of material for dissection in his study of comparative\r\nanatomy by his pupil, Alexander the Great. Aristotle pointed out the\r\ndifferences in the anatomy of men and monkeys; he described the anatomy\r\nof the elephant and of birds, and also the changes in development seen\r\nduring the incubation of eggs. He investigated, also, the anatomy of\r\nfishes and reptiles. The stomachs of ruminant animals excited his\r\ninterest, and he described their structure. The heart, according to\r\nAristotle, was the seat of the soul, and the birthplace of the passions,\r\nfor it held the natural fire, and in it centred movement, sensation and\r\nnourishment. The diaphragm, he believed, separated the heart, the seat\r\nof the soul, from the contaminating influences of the intestines. He did\r\nnot advance beyond the conception that nerves were akin to ligaments and\r\ntendons, and he believed that the nerves originated in the heart, as did\r\nalso the blood-vessels. He named the _aorta_ and _ventricles_. He\r\ninvestigated the action of the muscles, and held that superfoetation was\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWhen Aristotle retired to Chalcis, he chose Tyrtamus, to whom he gave\r\nthe name of _Theophrastus_, as his successor at the Lyceum.\r\nTheophrastus was the originator of the science of Botany, and wrote the\r\n\"History of Plants.\" He also wrote about stones, and on physical, moral\r\nand medical subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 331 B.C.,\" wrote Kingsley, \"one of the greatest intellects\r\nwhose influence the world has ever felt, saw, with his eagle glance, the\r\nunrivalled advantages of the spot which is now Alexandria, and conceived\r\nthe mighty project of making it the point of union of two, or rather of\r\nthree worlds. In a new city named after himself, Europe, Asia and Africa\r\nwere to meet and hold communion.\" The School of Alexandria became, after\r\nthe decay of Greek culture, the centre of learning for the world, and\r\nwhen the Empire of Alexander the Great was subdivided, the Egyptian\r\nshare fell to the first Ptolemy, who, under the direction of Aristotle,\r\nfounded the Alexandrian Library, containing at first fifty thousand, and\r\nfinally seven hundred thousand volumes. Every student who came to the\r\nUniversity of Alexandria, and possessed a book of which there was not a\r\ncopy in the Alexandrian Library, was compelled to present the book to\r\nthe library. The first Ptolemy also fostered the study of medicine and\r\nof dissection. Eumenes likewise established a library at Pergamos. It\r\nis instructive to follow the history of the great Library of Alexandria.\r\nThe greater part of the library, which contained the collected\r\nliterature of Greece, Rome, India and Egypt, was housed in the famous\r\nmuseum in the part of Alexandria called the Brucheion. This part was\r\ndestroyed by fire during the siege of Alexandria by Julius Cæsar. Mark\r\nAntony, then, at the urgent desire of Cleopatra, transferred to\r\nAlexandria the books and manuscripts from Pergamos. The other part of\r\nthe library was kept at Alexandria in the Serapeum, the temple of\r\nJupiter Serapis, and there it remained till the time of Theodosius the\r\nGreat, until in 391 A.D. both temple and library were almost completely\r\ndestroyed by a fanatical mob of Christians led by the Archbishop\r\nTheophilus. When Alexandria was taken by the Arabs in 641, under the\r\nCalif Omar, the destruction was completed.\r\n\r\nPtolemy gathered to the museum at Alexandria a number of very learned\r\nmen, who lived within its walls and were provided with salaries, the\r\nwhole system closely resembling a university. Grammar, prosody,\r\nmythology, astronomy and philosophy were studied, and great attention\r\nwas given to the study of medicine. Euclid was the teacher of\r\nMathematics, and Hipparchus of Alexandria was the father of Astronomy.\r\nThe teaching of medicine and of astronomy was for long based upon\r\nobservation of ascertained facts. The Alexandrian School endured for\r\nclose upon a thousand years, and its history may be divided into two\r\nperiods, namely, from 323 to 30 B.C., during the period of the\r\nPtolemies, and from 30 B.C. to 640 A.D. The second period was\r\ndistinguished for the study of speculative philosophy, and of the\r\nreligious philosophy of the Gnostics, and was not a scientific period.\r\n\r\nJulius Cæsar was not the only Roman Emperor who brought trouble upon the\r\nAlexandrian School, for the brutal Caracalla took away the salaries and\r\nprivileges from the _savants_, and prohibited scientific exhibitions and\r\ndiscussions. In recent excavations in the Baths of Caracalla in Rome,\r\nthe ruins of a library have been discovered, and it is believed by some\r\narchæologists that Caracalla supplied this library with books and\r\nparchments from Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe Asclepiadæ of Cos and Cnidos had discoursed upon the phenomena of\r\ndisease, without attempting to demonstrate its structural relations;\r\nlike the sculptors of their own age, they studied the changing\r\nexpression of vital action almost wholly from an external point of view.\r\nThey meddled not with the dead, for, by their own laws, no one was\r\nallowed to die within the temple. But the early Alexandrians were\r\nsubject to no such restrictions; and turning to good account the\r\ndiscoveries of Aristotle in natural history and comparative anatomy,\r\nthey undertook for the first time to describe the organization of the\r\nhuman frame from actual dissections.[7]\r\n\r\nThus there was inaugurated at Alexandria the Anatomic Period of\r\nMedicine, which lasted till Egypt came under the sway of the Romans.\r\nMedical practice became so flourishing at Alexandria that three great\r\nspecialities were established, namely, Surgery, Pharmacy, and Dietetics,\r\nand a great variety of operations were performed. Lithotomy was much\r\npractised by specialists. A foul murder was perpetrated by lithotomists\r\nat the instigation of Diodotus, the guardian of Antiochus, son of\r\nAlexander, King of Syria (150 B.C.), young Antiochus, at the age of 10,\r\nbeing done to death under the pretence that he had a stone in his\r\nbladder.\r\n\r\nAbout 150 B.C. a sect called the Essenes was established for the study\r\nof curative and poisonous substances. The members were not all\r\nphysicians, by any means, for one of the chief was King Mithridates, who\r\ninvented the remedy known as mithridaticum. This celebrated nostrum of\r\nantiquity is said to have been a confection of twenty leaves of rue, a\r\nfew grains of salt, two walnuts, and two figs, intended to be taken\r\nevery morning and followed by a draught of wine.\r\n\r\nTwo famous physicians and anatomists, _Herophilus_ (335-280 B.C.) and\r\n_Erasistratus_ (280 B.C.) took part in the medical teaching at\r\nAlexandria in the early days of that seat of learning. It is recorded\r\nthat they did not confine their investigations to the dissection of the\r\ndead, but also vivisected criminals. _Cleombrotus_, another physician\r\nat this school, was sent for to attend King Antiochus, and was rewarded\r\nwith a hundred talents, equal to about £15,000 sterling.\r\n\r\nThere were several physicians of the name of _Chrysippos_ connected with\r\nthe Alexandrian School. One was physician to Ptolemy Soter, the King of\r\nEgypt, and tutor to Erasistratus. This Chrysippos introduced the\r\npractice of emptying a limb of blood before amputation, according to the\r\nrecent method of Esmarch, and is said to have employed vapour baths in\r\nthe treatment of dropsy.\r\n\r\nIn Alexandria, anatomy was properly studied.[8]\r\n\r\n_Herophilus_ made many anatomical discoveries, and some of the names he\r\ngave to parts of the body are now in use, for instance, torcular\r\nHerophili, calamus scriptorius, and duodenum. He described the\r\nconnection between the nerves and the brain, and the various parts of\r\nthe brain, and recognized the essential difference between motor and\r\nsensory nerves, although he thought the former arose in the membranes\r\nand the latter in the substance of the brain. He believed that the\r\nfourth ventricle was the seat of the soul. He attributed to the heart\r\nthe pulsations of the arteries, but thought that the pulmonary veins\r\nconveyed air from the lungs to the left side of the heart, and he\r\nobserved the lacteals without determining their function. Herophilus\r\noperated upon the liver and spleen, and looked upon the latter as of\r\nlittle consequence in the animal economy. He had a good knowledge of\r\nobstetric operations. His ideas in relation to pathology did not proceed\r\nmuch further than the belief that disease was due to corruption of the\r\nhumors. He was more scientific and accurate when he taught that\r\nparalysis results from a defect in the nerves.\r\n\r\n_Erasistratus_ studied under Chrysippos (or Chrysippus), and under\r\nMetrodorus, the son-in-law of Aristotle. Herophilus had been a student\r\nat Cos, Erasistratus at Cnidos, so that the teaching of the two great\r\nGreek medical schools was introduced into Alexandria. Xenophon, of Cos,\r\none of the followers of Erasistratus, first resorted to the ligation of\r\nvessels for the arrest of hæmorrhage, although for many years in later\r\ntimes this important practice was lost through the neglect of the study\r\nof the history of medicine. Erasistratus and Herophilus, it is sad to\r\nrelate, considered that vivisection of human beings, as well as\r\ndissection of the dead, was a necessary part of medical education, and\r\nbelieved that the sufferings of a few criminals did not weigh against\r\nthe benefit likely to accrue to innocent people, who could be relieved\r\nor cured of disease and suffering as the result of the knowledge gained\r\nby dissection of the living. This cruel and nefarious practice was\r\nfollowed \"so that the investigators could study the particular organs\r\nduring life in regard to position, colour, form, size, disposition,\r\nhardness, softness, smoothness, and superficial extent, their projection\r\nand curvatures.\"\r\n\r\nThe followers of these teachers, unfortunately, became very speculative\r\nand fond of discussions of a fruitless kind, and, according to Pliny, it\r\nwas easier \"to sit and listen quietly in the schools than to be up and\r\nwandering over the deserts, and to seek out new plants every day,\"[9]\r\nand so, in the third century before Christ, the school of _Empiricism_\r\nwas established, the system of which resembled the older Scepticism. It\r\nrested upon the \"Empiric tripod,\" namely, accident, history and analogy.\r\nThis meant that discoveries were made by accident, knowledge was\r\naccumulated by the recollection of previous cases, and treatment adopted\r\nwhich had been found suitable in similar circumstances. _Philinus of\r\nCos_, a pupil of Herophilus, declared that all the anatomy he had\r\nlearned from his master did not help him in the least to cure diseases.\r\nPhilinus, according to Galen, founded the Empirici, the first schismatic\r\nsect in medicine. Celsus[10] wrote of this sect that they admit that\r\nevident causes are necessary, but deprecate inquiry into them because\r\nNature is incomprehensible. This is proved because the philosophers and\r\nphysicians who have spent so much labour in trying to search out these\r\noccult causes cannot agree amongst themselves. If reasoning could make\r\nphysicians, the philosophers should be most successful practitioners, as\r\nthey have such abundance of words. If the causes of diseases were the\r\nsame in all places, the same remedies ought to be used everywhere.\r\nRelief from sickness is to be sought from things certain and tried, that\r\nis from experience, which guides us in all other arts. Husbandmen and\r\npilots do not reason about their business, but they practise it.\r\nDisquisitions can have no connection with medicine, because physicians\r\nwhose opinions have been directly opposed to one another have equally\r\nrestored their patients to health; they did not derive their methods of\r\ncure from studying the occult causes about which they disputed, but from\r\nthe experience they had of the remedies which they employed upon their\r\npatients. Medicine was not first discovered in consequence of reasoning,\r\nbut the theory was sought for after the discovery of medicine. Does\r\nreason, they ask, prescribe the same as experience, or something\r\ndifferent? If the same, it must be needless; if different, it must be\r\nmischievous.\r\n\r\nIn the third and second centuries before Christ, many physicians wrote\r\ncommentaries on diseases and attacked the teaching of Hippocrates.\r\nAmong these, _Serapion of Alexandria_, an Empiric who lived in the third\r\ncentury before Christ, is noteworthy for having first used sulphur in\r\nthe treatment of skin diseases, and Heraclides wrote on strangulated\r\nhernia. Serapion added somewhat to the system of Philinus, and was\r\nresponsible for introducing the principle of analogy into the system of\r\nEmpiricism. The foundation of Empiricism marked the decline of the\r\nmedical school of Alexandria. We are indebted to Celsus for a full\r\ndescription of the teaching of this sect, and, at the same time, for an\r\nexposure of its fallacies. Serapion was a convert from the school of\r\nCos, which was the stronghold of medical dogmatism, and, like nearly all\r\napostates, he was consumed with animosity and bitterness towards those\r\nwith whom he had formerly been in agreement. Cnidos was the stronghold\r\nof the Empirics.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] \"The Medical Profession in Ancient Times.\" Watson, p. 90.\r\n\r\n[8] Arctinus: \"Ethiopis,\" Translated in Puschmann's \"Hist.

He studied both rhetoric and\r\nmedicine at Alexandria and at Athens. He began as a teacher of rhetoric\r\nin Rome, but, although he was the friend of Cicero, he was not very\r\nsuccessful, and abandoned this study for the practice of medicine. He\r\nhad a great deal of ability and shrewdness, but no knowledge of anatomy\r\nor physiology, and he condemned all who thought that these subjects of\r\nstudy were the foundation of the healing art. He specially inveighed\r\nagainst Hippocrates, and with some reason, for the disciples of\r\nHippocrates had elevated the teaching of their master almost into a\r\nreligion, and were bound far too closely to his authority, to the\r\nexclusion of original thought and progress.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades had many pupils, and his teaching led to the foundation of\r\nthe Medical School of the Methodists. His most important maxim was that\r\na cure should be effected \"_tuto, celeriter, ac jucunde_,\" and he\r\nbelieved that what the physician could do was of primary importance, and\r\n_vis medicatrix naturæ_ only secondary. He was thus directly opposed to\r\nthe teaching of Hippocrates. He had little or no faith in drugs, and\r\nrelied mainly upon diet, exercises and massage, and, to some extent,\r\nupon surgery. His practice of prescribing wine in liberal doses added to\r\nhis popularity. It was the custom to take wine very much diluted with\r\nwater, but Asclepiades ordered wine in full strength or only slightly\r\ndiluted. He practised bronchotomy and tracheotomy, and recommended in\r\nsuitable cases of dropsy scarification of the ankles, and advised that,\r\nin tapping, an opening as small as possible should be made. He also\r\nobserved spontaneous dislocation of the hip. He was a very famous man in\r\nthe Roman Republic, and was well acquainted with philosophy, especially\r\nthe philosophy of the Epicureans. Although he was almost entirely\r\nignorant of anatomy, he was far from being a quack. He had great powers\r\nof observation and natural shrewdness, and his success largely\r\ncontributed to the establishment of Greek doctors and their methods in\r\nRome. There is grim humour in his description of the Hippocratic\r\ntreatise on therapeutics, which he called \"a meditation on death.\" Pliny\r\nrelates that Asclepiades wagered that he would never die of disease, and\r\nhe won the wager, for he lived to old age and died of an accident!\r\n\r\n_Themison, of Laodicea_, lived in the first century before Christ, and\r\nwas a pupil of Asclepiades of Prusa, the founder of the School of\r\nMethodism. His views on atoms and pores led him to adopt a very simple\r\nexplanation of health and disease, for he considered that these pores\r\nmust be either constricted or dilated, and the aim of the physician\r\nshould be to dilate the constriction, and _vice versa_. This epitomized\r\nsystem of medicine did away with the use of many classes of drugs, and,\r\nfrom its simplicity, was quickly learned. A jeering opponent of the\r\nsystem of the Methodici said that it could be taught in six months, and\r\nGalen, in later years, ridiculed it, and called its practitioners \"the\r\nasses of Thessaly.\"\r\n\r\nThe great fault of Dogmatism was its absolute reliance on the wisdom of\r\nHippocrates, and Methodism was marred by its insufficiency and\r\nsophistry.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his extravagant theories, Themison possessed skill in\r\npractice. He was the first physician to describe rheumatism, and he also\r\nis thought to have been the pioneer in the medicinal use of leeches. A\r\nbook on elephantiasis ascribed to him is not definitely known to be\r\nauthentic. It is worthy of note that he was anxious to write on\r\nhydrophobia, but a case he had seen in early youth so impressed his mind\r\nwith horror that the mere thought of the disease caused him to suffer\r\nsome of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe views of the Methodists were less extreme than those of the\r\nDogmatists and Empirics. Celsus wrote of the Methodists: \"They assert\r\nthat the knowledge of no cause whatever bears the least relation to the\r\nmethod of cure; and that it is sufficient to observe some general\r\nsymptoms of distempers; and that there are three kinds of diseases, one\r\nbound, another loose, and the third is a mixture of these.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThere were several physicians of the name of Themison at different\r\ntimes, and it is probably the founder of the Methodici who was satirized\r\nby Juvenal thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"How many patients Themison dispatched\r\n    In one short autumn.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThe joke which is based on attributing a cure to Nature alone, and death\r\nsolely to the physician's want of skill, is one of the most\r\ntime-honoured.\r\n\r\nThemison lived at the close of the Roman Republic, and it will now be\r\nnecessary to consider the state of the healing art in Rome under the\r\nrule of the emperors.\r\n\r\nJulius Cæsar--one of the first triumvirate--invaded and conquered Gaul\r\nand Britain, and after these great military achievements, found that he\r\ncould not sheath his sword until he had met in battle his rival Pompey.\r\nCæsar defeated Pompey at Pharsalia, in Thessaly (48 B.C.), and pursued\r\nhim to Egypt. Pompey was murdered in Egypt, and his last followers\r\nfinally defeated in Spain, and in 45 B.C. Julius Cæsar returned to Rome,\r\nand was declared perpetual _imperator_. On March 15, 44 B.C., he was\r\nassassinated. It is possible that the career of this great man may have\r\npromoted the surgery of the battlefield, but his reign as Emperor was\r\ntoo short, and the political situation of his time too acute, to permit\r\nof much progress in the arts of peace generally, and in the medical art\r\nparticularly. Julius Cæsar bestowed the right of Roman citizenship on\r\nall medical practitioners in the city.\r\n\r\nReferring to the death of Julius Cæsar, Suetonius writes that among so\r\nmany wounds there was none that was mortal, in the opinion of the\r\nsurgeon Antistus, except the second, which he received in the breast.\r\n\r\nOctavianus was appointed one of the second triumvirate, his colleagues\r\nbeing Mark Antony and Lepidus. Lepidus was first forced out of the\r\ntriumvirate, and Octavianus and Mark Antony then came into conflict.\r\nDuring these rivalries, a great civic work was accomplished by Marcus\r\nAgrippa, who built the aqueduct known as _Aqua Julia_. A landmark in\r\nhistory is the battle of Actium, in which Octavianus defeated Mark\r\nAntony and his ally Cleopatra, and within a few years Octavianus was\r\nproclaimed Emperor as Augustus Cæsar (27 B.C.). Under his rule Rome\r\ngreatly prospered, and we shall now consider the state of medicine and\r\nof sanitation during his illustrious reign.\r\n\r\nIn the Roman Empire there was a spirit of toleration abroad, \"and the\r\nvarious modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all\r\nconsidered by the people as equally true; by the philosopher, as equally\r\nfalse; and by the magistrate, as equally useful. And thus toleration\r\nproduced not only mutual indulgence, but even religious concord\"\r\n(Gibbon).\r\n\r\nThe systems of philosophy in vogue were those of the Stoics, the\r\nPlatonists, the Academics, and the Epicureans, and of these only the\r\nPlatonists had any belief in God, who was to them an idea rather than a\r\nSupreme Being. The great aim of both the wise and the foolish was to\r\nglorify their nationality, and their beliefs, their rites, and their\r\nsuperstitions, were all for the glory of mighty Rome.\r\n\r\nEducated Romans were able to speak and write both Latin and Greek, and\r\nthe latter language was the vehicle used by men of science and of\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nThe population of the city of Rome at the beginning of the Augustan age\r\nwas not less than half a million of people, and probably exceeded this\r\nnumber. There was no middle class, a comparatively small number of\r\ngentry, a very numerous _plebs_ or populace, and many slaves. The\r\nEmperor Augustus boasted that after the war with Sextus Pompeius he\r\nhanded over 30,000 slaves, who had been serving with the enemy, to their\r\nmasters to be punished. The slaves were looked upon by their masters as\r\nchattels. The plebs had the spirit of paupers and, to keep them\r\ncontented and pacific, were fed and shown brutalizing spectacles in the\r\narenas. Augustus wrote that he gave the people wild-beast hunts in the\r\ncircus and amphitheatres twenty-six times, in which about 3,500 animals\r\nwere killed. It was his custom to watch the Circensian games from his\r\npalace in view of a multitude of spectators.\r\n\r\nThroughout the country generally agriculture prospered, and the supply\r\nof various grasses for feeding cattle in the winter increased the\r\nmultitude of the flocks and herds; great attention was given also to\r\nmines and fisheries and all forms of industry. Virgil praised his\r\nbeautiful and fertile country:--\r\n\r\n    \"But no, not Medeland with its wealth of woods,\r\n    Fair Ganges, Hermus thick with golden silt,\r\n    Can match the praise of Italy....\r\n    Here blooms perpetual spring, and summer here\r\n    In months that are not summer's; twice teem the flocks:\r\n    Twice does the tree yield service of her fruit.\r\n    Mark too, her cities, so many and so proud,\r\n    Of mighty toil the achievement, town on town\r\n    Up rugged precipices heaved and reared,\r\n    And rivers gliding under ancient walls.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe city of Rome was not a desirable place for medical practice, for the\r\nlower classes were degraded and thriftless, and the relatively small\r\nupper classes were tyrannical, debauched, superstitious, selfish and\r\ncruel. The younger Pliny, who was one of the best type of Romans, tried\r\nto investigate the purity of the lives of the Christians, and did not\r\nhesitate to put to torture two women, deaconesses, who belonged to the\r\nnew religion, but he \"could discover only an obstinate kind of\r\nsuperstition carried to great excess.\" His conduct and his opinion speak\r\neloquently of the nature of a Roman gentleman of the Empire. As for the\r\nstate of the poor under Augustus, 200,000 persons in Rome received\r\noutdoor relief. Although the rich had every luxury that desire could\r\nsuggest and wealth afford, the great need of the common people was food.\r\nThe city had to rely mainly on imported corn, and the price of this at\r\ntimes became prohibitive owing to scarcity--sometimes the result of\r\npiracy and the dangers of the sea, but often caused by artificial means\r\nowing to the merchants \"cornering\" the supply--and it was necessary for\r\nthe State, through the Emperor, to intervene to make regulations and to\r\ndistribute the grain free or below its market value. It has been\r\ncomputed that about 50,000 strangers lived in Rome, many of whom were\r\nadventurers.\r\n\r\nThe imperial city was the happy hunting-ground of quacks, who gave\r\nthemselves high-sounding names and wore gorgeous raiment. They went\r\nabout followed by a retinue of pupils and grateful patients. In some\r\ncases the patients were compelled to promise, in the event of being\r\ncured, that they would serve their doctor ever afterwards. The retinue\r\nof students, no doubt, was rather disturbing to a nervous patient, and\r\nMartial wrote:--\r\n\r\n    \"Faint was I only, Symmachus, till thou\r\n      Backed by an hundred students, throng'dst my bed;\r\n    An hundred icy fingers chilled my brow:\r\n      I had no fever; now I'm nearly dead.\"[14]\r\n\r\nBesides quack doctors there were drug sellers (_pharmacopola_), who sold\r\ntheir medicines in booths or hawked them in the city and the country. In\r\nthe time of the Empire the medicines of the regular practitioners were\r\nsold with a label which specified the name of the drug and of the\r\ninventor, the ingredients, the disease it was to be used for, and the\r\nmethod of taking it. Drug sellers dispensed cosmetics as well as\r\nmedicines, and some of the itinerant dealers sold poison. The regular\r\nphysicians bought medicines already compounded by the druggists, and the\r\nlatter, as in our own day, prescribed as well as the physicians.\r\n\r\nDepilatories were much in vogue, and were usually made of arsenic and\r\nunslaked lime, but also from the roots and juices of plants. They were\r\nfirst used only by women, but in later times also by effeminate men.\r\nTweezers have been discovered which were adapted for pulling out hairs,\r\nand most of the depilatories were recommended to be applied after the\r\nuse of the tweezers. The duty of pulling out hairs was performed by\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nMost of the medical practitioners in the time of Augustus were either\r\nslaves or freedmen. Posts of responsibility and of honour were sometimes\r\nassigned to freedmen, as is shown by the appointment by Nero of Helius,\r\na freedman, to the administration of Rome in the absence of his imperial\r\nmaster. Cicero wrote letters to his freedman Tiro in terms of friendship\r\nand affection. The master of a great household selected a slave for his\r\nability and aptitude, and had him trained to be the medical adviser of\r\nthe household; and the skill shown by the doctor sometimes gained for\r\nhim his freedom.\r\n\r\nThere were 400 slaves in one great household of Rome, and they were all\r\nexecuted for not having prevented the murder of their master.[15] It is\r\nrecorded that physicians were sometimes compelled to do the disgusting\r\nwork of mutilating slaves.[16] The price of a slave physician was fixed\r\nat sixty solidi.[17] The great majority of physicians in Rome were\r\nfreedmen who had booths in which they prescribed and compounded, and\r\nthey were aided by freedmen and slaves who were both assistants and\r\npupils. The medical profession, as has been shown, never attained the\r\nsame dignity as in Greece. It should be understood that there was a\r\nclass of practising physicians in Rome quite distinct from the slave\r\ndoctors. The following account of Lucius Horatillavus, a Roman quack of\r\nthe time of Augustus, is taken from the _British Medical Journal_ of\r\nJune 10, 1911, and originated in an article in the _Société Nouvelle_,\r\nwritten by M. Fernand Mazade:--\r\n\r\n\"He was a handsome man, and came from Naples to Rome, his sole outfit\r\nbeing a toga made of a piece of cloth adorned with obscene pictures and\r\na small Asiatic mitre. Like many of his kind at that day, he sold\r\npoisons and invented five or six new remedies which were more or less\r\nhaphazard mixtures of wine and poisonous substances. He had the good\r\nluck to cure his first patient, Titus Cnoeus Leno, who, being a poet,\r\nstraightway constituted himself the _vates sacer_ of his physician, and\r\ninduced some of his fashionable mistresses to place themselves under his\r\nhands. So profitable was Horatillavus's practice that he is said to have\r\nsaved 150,000 sesterces in a few months. But for a moment his good\r\nfortune seemed to abandon him. A Roman lady, Sulpicia Pallas, died\r\nsuddenly under his ministrations. This may have been due to his\r\nignorance or carelessness; but he was accused of having poisoned his\r\npatient. This event might have been expected to bring his career to an\r\nend; but it was not long before he recovered the confidence of the\r\npeople whom he deluded with his mystical language and promises of cure.\r\nHe had three methods of treatment, all consisting of baths--hot, tepid,\r\nor cold--preceded or followed by the taking of wonder-working medicines.\r\nHoratillavus treated every kind of disease, internal and external; he\r\neven practised midwifery, which was then in the hands of women. Ten\r\nyears after he settled in Rome he had accumulated a fortune of some\r\n6,000,000 sesterces. He had a villa at Tusculum, whither he went three\r\ntimes a month; there he led a luxurious life in the most beautiful\r\nsurroundings, and there his evil fate overtook him. His orchard was his\r\nespecial pride. One day he found that birds had played havoc with his\r\nfigs, the like of which were not to be found in Italy. Determined to\r\nprevent similar depredations in future, he poisoned the fig trees.\r\nContinuing his walk, he plucked fruits of various kinds here and there.\r\nWhile eating the fruit he had culled and drinking choice wine, he put\r\ninto his mouth a poisoned fig, which he had inadvertently gathered, and\r\nquickly died in convulsions. Before passing away, however, he is said to\r\nhave composed his own epitaph. This M. Mazade believes he has found. It\r\nreads: \"The manes of Sulpicia Pallas have avenged her. Here lies Lucius\r\nHoratillavus, physician, who poisoned himself.\" If the epitaph is\r\ngenuine, it is a confession of guilt. The death of the quack by his own\r\npoison is a curious Nemesis. The manner of his death proves that it was\r\naccidental, as few quacks are bold enough to take their own medicines.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] \"De Medic.,\" lib. 1.\r\n\r\n[12] \"Sat.,\" x, 221.\r\n\r\n[13] Rhodes's version.\r\n\r\n[14] Handerson's translation.\r\n\r\n[15] \"Tacit.

In 34 B.C., Agrippa, under the\r\ninfluence of Augustus, had improved the water supply of Rome by\r\nrestoring the Aqua Marcia, and Augustus had repaired and enlarged the\r\ncloacæ, and repaired the principal streets. Road commissions were\r\nappointed 27 B.C. The Aqua Virgo was built 19 B.C. Many of the\r\n_collegia_, or guilds, founded for the promotion of the interests of\r\nprofessions and trades had been misused for political purposes, and\r\nAugustus deprived many of them of their charters. _Curæ_, or\r\ncommissions, were appointed to superintend public works, streets and the\r\nwater-supply; and the Tiber was dredged, cleansed and widened, and its\r\nliability to overflow reduced. No new building could be built more than\r\n70 ft. high. Augustus also established fire brigades. It has been said\r\nthat he found the city built of brick and left it built of marble.\r\n\r\nHe revived many old religious customs, such as the Augury of Public\r\nHealth, and identified himself closely with the rites and customs of the\r\npeople. He inculcated that sense of duty which the Romans called\r\n_pietas_, and attempted to improve the morals of the citizens by the\r\nenactment of sumptuary laws; the philosophers hoped to do good in the\r\nsame direction by appealing to the intellect and reason, a method that\r\nwas equally ineffectual. Marriages and an increased birth-rate were\r\nencouraged, and parents were honoured and given special privileges. The\r\nwisdom and prudence of Augustus were strangely accompanied by credulity\r\nand superstition. He was a profound believer in omens, and attached\r\ngreat importance to astrology. His horoscope showed that he was born\r\nunder the sign of Capricorn.\r\n\r\nHe suffered from various illnesses, although in his younger days he\r\nlooked handsome and athletic. He carefully nursed his health against his\r\nmany infirmities, avoiding chiefly the free use of the bath; but he was\r\noften rubbed with oil, and sweated in a stove, after which he was bathed\r\nin tepid water, warmed either by a fire, or by being exposed to the heat\r\nof the sun. When, on account of his nerves, he was obliged to have\r\nrecourse to sea-water, or the waters of Albula, he was contented with\r\nsitting over a wooden tub, (which he called by a Spanish name,\r\n_Dureta_), and plunging his hands and feet in the water by turns.[18]\r\nHis physician was Antonius Musa, to whom was erected, by public\r\nsubscription, a statue near that of Æsculapius. During an attack of\r\ncongestion of the liver when heat failed to give relief, Antonius Musa\r\nadvised cold applications for the Emperor, which had the desired effect.\r\nSuetonius, the historian, wrote that this was \"a desperate and doubtful\r\nmethod of cure.\" A more desperate and doubtful method of cure, however,\r\nwas carried out by the same physician. He successfully banished an\r\nattack of sciatica that greatly troubled Augustus by the expedient of\r\nbeating the affected part with a stick. Antonius Musa received honours\r\nfrom Augustus, and the Emperor also exempted all physicians from the\r\npayment of taxes, and from other public obligations.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Augustus natural philosophy made little progress, and\r\nVirgil strongly desired its advancement. Human anatomy, as a study, had\r\nnot been introduced, and physiology was almost unknown. In medicine, the\r\nstandard of practice was the writings of Hippocrates, and the Materia\r\nMedica consisted of remedies suggested by the whimsical notions of their\r\ninventors.\r\n\r\nPliny wrote that the water cure was the principal remedy in his day, as\r\nit was indeed throughout the Empire, and it was certainly the most\r\npopular. Seneca was very severe on the sentiment of a poem written by\r\nMæcenas, the friend and counsellor of Augustus, but it serves to reveal\r\nsome of the most dreaded maladies of the time:--\r\n\r\n    \"Though racked with gout in hand and foot,\r\n    Though cancer deep should strike its root,\r\n    Though palsy shake my feeble thighs,\r\n    Though hideous lump on shoulder rise,\r\n    From flaccid gum teeth drop away;\r\n    Yet all is well if life but stay.\"\r\n\r\nMalaria was one of the principal causes of mortality in and near Rome in\r\nthe reign of Augustus Cæsar.\r\n\r\nAugustus's fatal illness occurred in A.D. 14 from chronic diarrhoea, and\r\nthe Emperor, like the true Roman that he was, displayed great calmness\r\nand fortitude in his last days.\r\n\r\nTiberius succeeded to the throne in A.D. 14, and began a career of\r\ninfamy. How little knowledge was likely to gain from his patronage is\r\nshown by the fact, recorded by Pliny, that the shop and tools of the\r\nartist who discovered how to make glass malleable were destroyed.\r\nAssassins and perpetrators of every abomination were the fit companions\r\nof this tyrant.\r\n\r\nThrasyllus, the astrologer, lived with Tiberius, who was a firm believer\r\nin the magic arts. This reign is made illustrious in the history of\r\nmedicine by the work of Celsus.\r\n\r\nCaligula, who became Emperor in A.D. 34, was guilty of the most inhuman\r\nconduct. Criminals were given to the wild beasts for their food, and\r\neven people of honourable rank had their faces branded with hot irons as\r\na punishment by order of this mad tyrant.\r\n\r\nClaudius, the successor of Caligula, completed some very important\r\npublic works in his reign, including great aqueducts and drains, but\r\nlearning was at a low ebb in his day. Claudius Etruscus, the freedman of\r\nthe Emperor Claudius, erected baths referred to by Martial. The ruins of\r\nthe arches of the Aqua Claudia still remain.\r\n\r\nThrasyllus, a son of the astrologer who lived in the time of Tiberius,\r\nis said to have predicted to Nero the dignity of the purple. Nero would\r\nhave been favourably disposed towards physicians if he had heeded the\r\nadvice of his tutor, Seneca, who wrote: \"People pay the doctor for his\r\ntrouble; for his kindness they still remain in his debt.\" \"Great\r\nreverence and love is due to both the teacher and the doctor. We have\r\nreceived from them priceless benefits; from the doctor, health and life;\r\nfrom the teacher, the noble culture of the soul. Both are our friends,\r\nand deserve our most sincere thanks, not so much by their merchantable\r\nart, as by their frank goodwill.\"[19] The practice of necromancy in the\r\ntime of Nero had grown to such an extent that an edict of banishment\r\nwas issued against all magicians, but this did not lessen the popularity\r\nof the magicians, who indeed prospered under the semblance of\r\npersecution, and were honoured in times of public difficulty and danger.\r\nThe practice of astrology came from the Chaldeans, and was introduced\r\ninto Greece in the third century before Christ. It was accepted by all\r\nclasses, but specially by the Stoic philosophers. In 319 B.C., Cornelius\r\nHispallus banished the Chaldeans from Rome, and ordered them to leave\r\nItaly within ten days. In 33 B.C., they were again banished by Marcus\r\nAgrippa, and Augustus also issued an edict against them. They were\r\npunished sometimes by death, and their calling must have been lucrative\r\nto induce them to continue in spite of the severe punishments to which\r\nthey made themselves liable. The penal laws against them, however, were\r\nin operation only intermittently. They were consulted by all classes,\r\nfrom the Emperor downwards.\r\n\r\nThere were many physicians in the reign of Nero, but none of great\r\neminence. Andromachus was physician to the Emperor, and had the title of\r\n_archiater_, which means \"chief of the physicians.\"\r\n\r\nAn account of the archiaters is of interest. The name was applied to\r\nChrist by St. Jerome. There were two classes of archiaters in time, the\r\none class called _archiatri sancti palati_; the other, _archiatri\r\npopulares_. The former attended the Emperor, and were court physicians;\r\nthe latter attended the people. Although Nero appointed the first\r\narchiater, the name is not commonly used in Latin until the time of\r\nConstantine, and the division into two classes probably dates from about\r\nthat time. The _archiatri sancti palati_ were of high rank, and were the\r\njudges of disputes between physicians. The Archiatri had many privileges\r\nconferred upon them. They, and their wives and children, did not have to\r\npay taxes. They were not obliged to give lodgings to soldiers in the\r\nprovinces, and they could not be put in prison. These privileges applied\r\nmore especially to the higher class. When an _archiater sancti palati_\r\nceased attendance on the Emperor he took the title of ex-archiater. The\r\ntitle _comes archiatorum_ means \"count of the Archiatri,\" and gave rank\r\namong the high nobility of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe _archiatri populares_ attended the sick poor, and each city had\r\nfive, seven or ten, according to its size. Rome had fourteen of these\r\nofficers, besides one for the vestal virgins, and one for the gymnasia.\r\nThey were paid by the Government for attending the poor, but were not\r\nrestricted to this class of practice, and were well paid by their\r\nprosperous patients. Their office was more lucrative but not so\r\nhonourable as that of the archiaters of the palace. The _archiatri\r\npopulares_ were elected by the people themselves.\r\n\r\nSuetonius describes the treatment Nero underwent for the improvement of\r\nhis voice: \"He would lie upon his back with a sheet of lead upon his\r\nbreast, clear his stomach and bowels by vomits and clysters, and forbear\r\nthe eating of fruits, or food prejudicial to his voice.\" He built, at\r\ngreat expense, magnificent public baths supplied from the sea and from\r\nhot springs, and was the first to build a public gymnasium in Rome.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that in the time of Nero there was a class of\r\nwomen poisoners. Nero employed one of these women, Locusta by name, and\r\nafter she had poisoned Britannicus, rewarded her with a great estate in\r\nland, and placed disciples with her to be instructed in her nefarious\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nThere was also a very ignorant class of oculists in Rome in the time of\r\nNero, but at Marseilles Demosthenes Philalethes was deservedly\r\ncelebrated, and his book on diseases of the eye was in use for several\r\ncenturies. The eye doctors of Rome employed ointments almost entirely,\r\nand about two hundred seals have been discovered which had been attached\r\nto pots of eye salves, each seal bearing the inventor's and proprietor's\r\nname. In the time of Galen, these quack oculists were very numerous, and\r\nGalen inveighs against them. Martial satirized them: \"Now you are a\r\ngladiator who once were an ophthalmist; you did as a doctor what you do\r\nas a gladiator.\" \"The blear-eyed Hylas would have paid you sixpence, O\r\nQuintus; one eye is gone, he will still pay threepence; make haste and\r\ntake it, brief is your chance; when he is blind, he will pay you\r\nnothing.\" The oculists of Alexandria were very proficient, and some of\r\ntheir followers, at various times throughout the period of the Roman\r\nEmpire, were remarkably skilful. Their literature has perished, but it\r\nis believed that they were able to operate on cataract.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Nero in A.D. 68, the direct line of the Cæsars became\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Suetonius: \"Lives of the Cæsars,\" lxxxii.\r\n\r\n[19] Seneca \"De Benefic.,\" vi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPHYSICIANS FROM THE TIME OF AUGUSTUS TO THE DEATH OF NERO.\r\n\r\n     Celsus--His life and works--His influence on Medicine--Meges of\r\n     Sidon--Apollonius of Tyana--Alleged miracles--Vettius\r\n     Valleus--Scribonius Longus--Andromachus--Thessalus of\r\n     Tralles--Pliny.\r\n\r\n\r\nAulus Cornelius Celsus lived in the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius.\r\nReferences in his works show that he either lived at the same time as\r\nThemison or shortly after him. Verona has been claimed as his\r\nbirthplace, but the purity of his literary style shows that he lived for\r\na considerable time in Rome, and he was probably educated there. In\r\nPliny's account of the history of medicine, Celsus is not mentioned as\r\nhaving practised in Rome, and it is almost certain that he combined the\r\npractice of medicine with the study of science and literary pursuits;\r\nhis practice was not general, but restricted to his friends and\r\ndependents. His writings show that he had a clinical knowledge of\r\ndisease and a considerable amount of medical experience. He wrote not\r\nonly on medicine but also on history, philosophy, jurisprudence and\r\nrhetoric, agriculture and military tactics. His great medical work, \"De\r\nMedicina,\" comprises eight books. He properly begins with the history\r\nof medicine, and then proceeds to discuss the merits of the controversy\r\nbetween the Dogmatici and the Empirici. The first two books deal with\r\ngeneral principles and with diet, and the remaining books with\r\nparticular diseases; the third and fourth with internal diseases, the\r\nfifth and sixth with external diseases and pharmacy, and the last two\r\nare surgical, and of great merit and importance. In his methods of\r\ntreatment there can be discerned the influence of Asclepiades of Prusa,\r\nand the Hippocratic principle of aiding rather than opposing nature, but\r\nsome of his work displays originality. His devotion to Hippocrates\r\nhindered very much the exercise of his own powers, and set a bad\r\nexample, in this respect, to his successors.\r\n\r\nHe was rather free in the use of the lancet, but not to the same extent\r\nas his contemporaries, and he advocated the use of free purgation as\r\nwell as bleeding. He never could rid his mind of the orthodox humoral\r\ntheories of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n(1) _Surgery._--Although Celsus is the first writer in Rome to deal\r\nfully with surgical procedures, it must not be inferred that the\r\npractice of this art began to be developed in his time, for surgery was\r\nthen much more advanced than medicine. Many major operations were\r\nperformed, and it is very instructive for doctors of the present day to\r\nlearn that much that is considered modern was well understood by the\r\nancients. There is no greater fallacy than to suppose that medical\r\npractice generally, and surgery in particular, has reached no eminence\r\nexcept in very recent times. The operation of crushing a stone in the\r\nbladder was devised at Alexandria by Ammonius Lithotomos, (287 B.C.),\r\nand is thus described by Celsus:--\r\n\r\n\"A hook or crotchet is fixed upon the stone in such a way as easily to\r\nhold it firm, even when shaken, so that it may not revolve backward;\r\nthen an iron instrument is used, of moderate thickness, thin at the\r\nfront end but blunt, which, when applied to the stone and struck at the\r\nother end, cleaves it. Great care must be taken that the instrument do\r\nnot come into contact with the bladder itself, and that nothing fall\r\nupon it by the breaking of the stone.\"\r\n\r\nCelsus describes plastic operations for the repair of the nose, lips and\r\nears, though these operations are generally supposed to have been\r\nrecently devised.\r\n\r\nHe describes lithotomy, and operations upon the eye, as practised at\r\nAlexandria, both probably introduced there from India. Subcutaneous\r\nurethrotomy was also practised in his time.\r\n\r\nTrephining had long been a well-known operation of surgery. There is an\r\naccount in detail of how amputation should be performed.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of Celsus in reference to dislocations and fractures is\r\nremarkably advanced. Dislocations, he points out, should be reduced\r\nbefore inflammation sets in, and in failure of union of fractures, he\r\nrecommends extension and the rubbing together of the ends of the broken\r\nbone to promote union. If necessary, after minor measures have failed to\r\npromote union, he recommends an incision down to the ends of the bones,\r\nand the open incision and the fracture will heal at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that Celsus knew of the danger of giving\r\npurgatives in strangulated rupture of the bowels. For uncomplicated\r\nrupture he recommends reduction by taxis and operation. Cauterization of\r\nthe canal is part of the operation. He also gives careful directions for\r\nremoving foreign bodies from the ears.\r\n\r\nCelsus writes very fully on hæmorrhage, and describes the method of\r\ntying two ligatures upon a blood-vessel, and severing it between the\r\nligatures. His method of amputating in cases of gangrene by a simple\r\ncircular incision was in use down to comparatively modern times. He\r\ndescribes catheterization, plastic operations on the face, the resection\r\nof ribs for the cure of sinuses in the chest walls, operation for\r\ncataract, ear disease curable by the use of the syringe, and operations\r\nfor goitre. These goitre operations are generally supposed to be a\r\nrecent triumph of surgery.\r\n\r\nCelsus also had knowledge of dentistry, for he writes of teeth\r\nextraction by means of forceps, the fastening of loose teeth with gold\r\nwire, and a method of bursting decayed and hollow teeth by means of\r\npeppercorns forced into the cavity. He has described also many of the\r\nmost difficult operations in obstetrics.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that Celsus lived centuries before the\r\nintroduction of chloroform and ether, it is wonderful to contemplate\r\nwhat was accomplished long ago.\r\n\r\nThe qualities which should distinguish a surgeon were described by\r\nCelsus thus: \"He should not be old, his hand should be firm and steady,\r\nand he should be able to use his left hand equally with his right; his\r\nsight should be clear, and his mind calm and courageous, so that he need\r\nnot hurry during an operation and cut less than required, as if the\r\nscreams of the patient made no impression upon him.\"\r\n\r\n(2) _Anatomy._--Celsus understood fairly well the situation of the\r\ninternal organs, and knew well the anatomy of the chest and female\r\npelvis. His knowledge of the skeleton was particularly complete and\r\naccurate. He describes very fully the bones of the head, including the\r\nperforated plate of the ethmoid bone, the sutures, the teeth, and the\r\nskeletal bones generally. Portal states that Celsus knew of the\r\nsemicircular canals. He understood the structure of the joints, and\r\npoints out that cartilage is part of their formation.\r\n\r\nCelsus wrote: \"It is both cruel and superfluous to dissect the bodies\r\nof the living, but to dissect those of the dead is necessary for\r\nlearners, for they ought to know the position and order which dead\r\nbodies show better than a living and wounded man. But even the other\r\nthings which can only be observed in the living, practice itself will\r\nshow in the cures of the wounded, a little more slowly but somewhat more\r\ntenderly.\"\r\n\r\n(3) _Medicine._--His treatment of fevers was excellent, for he\r\nrecognized that fever was an effort of Nature to throw off morbid\r\nmaterials. His recipes are not so complicated, but more sensible and\r\neffective than those of his immediate successors. He understood the use\r\nof enemas and artificial feeding. In cases of insanity he recognized\r\nthat improvement followed the use of narcotics in the treatment of the\r\naccompanying insomnia. He recognized also morbid illusions. He\r\nrecommended lotions and salves for the treatment of some eye diseases.\r\n\r\nAlthough Celsus practised phlebotomy, he discountenanced very strongly\r\nits excessive use. The physicians in Rome, in his time, carried bleeding\r\nto great extremes. \"It is not,\" wrote Celsus, \"a new thing to let blood\r\nfrom the veins, but it is new that there is scarcely a malady in which\r\nblood is not drawn. Formerly they bled young men, and women who were not\r\npregnant, but it had not been seen till our days that children, pregnant\r\nwomen, and old men were bled.\" The reason for bleeding the strong and\r\nplethoric was to afford outlet to an excessive supply of blood, and the\r\nweak and anæmic were similarly treated to get rid of evil humours, so\r\nthat hardly any sick person could escape this drastic treatment.\r\n\r\nEmetics were greatly used in the time of Celsus. Voluptuaries made use\r\nof them to excite an appetite for food, and they used them after eating\r\nheavy meals to prepare the stomach for a second bout of gluttony. Many\r\ngourmands took an emetic daily. Celsus said that emetics should not be\r\nused as a frequent practice if the attainment of old age was desired.\r\n\r\nCelsus excelled as a compiler, and had the faculty of selecting the most\r\nadmirable contributions to the art of healing from previous medical\r\nwriters. His writings also give an account of what was best in the\r\nmedical practice of Rome about his own time. He had a great love for\r\nlearning, and it is remarkable that he was attracted to the study of\r\nmedicine, for he was a patrician, and members of his class considered\r\nstudy of that kind beneath the dignity of their rank.\r\n\r\nIn the Augustan age, when literature in Rome reached its highest level,\r\nthe literary style of Celsus was fit to be classed with that of the\r\ngreat writers of his time. He was never quoted as a great authority on\r\nmedicine or surgery by later medical writers; and Pliny refers to him as\r\na literary man, and not as a practising physician. From the fact that\r\nhe elaborated no new system, and founded no new medical sect, it is not\r\nstrange that he had no disciples.\r\n\r\nIn later centuries his works were used as a textbook for students, not\r\nonly for the information they supplied, but also because of their\r\nexcellence as literature.\r\n\r\nParts of the foregoing synopsis of the writings of Celsus are drawn from\r\nthe writings of Hermann Baas and of Berdoe.\r\n\r\n_Meges of Sidon_ (20 B.C.) was a famous surgeon who practised in Rome\r\nshortly before the time of Celsus. He was regarded by Celsus as the most\r\nskilful surgeon of that period, and his works, of which nothing now\r\nremains, were quoted by Celsus, and also referred to by Pliny. Meges was\r\na follower of Themison. He is said to have invented instruments used in\r\ncutting for stone, and he wrote on tumours of the breast and dislocation\r\nof the knee. There have been several famous doctors called _Eudemus_.\r\nOne of these was an anatomist in the third century before Christ, and a\r\ncontemporary, according to Galen, of Herophilus and Erasistratus. He\r\ngave great attention to the anatomy and physiology of the nervous\r\nsystem. There was, however, another Eudemus, a physician of Rome, who\r\nbecame entangled in an intrigue with the wife of the son of the Emperor\r\nTiberius. He aided her in an attempt to poison her husband in A.D. 23.\r\nHe was put to torture, and finally executed by order of Tiberius.\r\n\r\n_Apollonius of Tyana_ was born four years before the Christian era, in\r\nthe time of Augustus Cæsar, and is known chiefly for the parallel that\r\nhas been drawn by ancient and modern writers between his supposed\r\nmiracles and those of the Saviour. His doings as described by\r\nPhilostratus are extraordinary and incredible, and he was put forward by\r\nthe Eclectics in opposition to the unique powers claimed by Christ and\r\nbelieved in by His followers. Apollonius is said to have studied the\r\nphilosophy of the Platonic, Sceptic, Epicurean, Peripatetic and\r\nPythagorean schools, and to have adopted that of Pythagoras. He schooled\r\nhimself in early manhood in the asceticism of that philosophy. He\r\nabstained from animal food and strong drink, wore white linen garments\r\nand sandals made of bark, and let his hair grow long. For five years he\r\npreserved a mystic silence, and during this period the truths of\r\nphilosophy became known to him. He had interviews with the Magi in Asia\r\nMinor, and learned strange secrets from the Brahmans in India. In Greece\r\nhe visited the temples and oracles, and exercised his powers of healing.\r\nLike Pythagoras, he travelled far and wide, disputing about philosophy\r\nwherever he went, and he gained an extraordinary reputation for magical\r\npowers. The priests of the temples gave him divine honours and sent the\r\nsick to him to be cured. He arrived in Rome just after an edict had been\r\npromulgated by Nero against magicians. He was tried before Telesinus,\r\nthe consul, and Tigellinus, the base favourite of the Emperor. He was\r\nacquitted by Telesinus because of his love of philosophy, and by\r\nTigellinus because of his fear of magic. Subsequently, at Alexandria,\r\nApollonius, in virtue of his magic power, affirmed that he would make\r\nVespasian emperor, and afterwards became the friend of Titus,\r\nVespasian's son. On the accession of Domitian, Apollonius stirred up the\r\nprovinces against him, and was ordered to be brought in custody to Rome,\r\nbut he surrendered himself to the authorities, and was brought into the\r\npresence of the Emperor to be questioned. He began to praise Nerva, and\r\nwas immediately ordered to prison and to chains. It is said that he\r\nmiraculously escaped, and spent the remainder of his days in Ephesus.\r\n\r\nThe relation of Apollonius to the art of medicine is connected with his\r\nvisits, on his travels, to the temples of Æsculapius, and his healing of\r\nthe sick and alleged triumph over the laws of Nature. He was also\r\ncredited with raising the dead, casting out devils and other\r\nmiracle-working that appears to have been borrowed from the life of\r\nChrist. No doubt he was a genuine philosopher and follower of\r\nPythagoras. His history is, on the whole, worthy of belief, except the\r\npart relating to miracles. It is noteworthy that he did not claim for\r\nhimself miraculous power. Newman in his \"Life of Apollonius\" takes the\r\nview that the account of the miracles of Apollonius is derived from the\r\nnarrative of Christ's miracles, and has been concocted by people\r\nanxious to degrade the character of the Saviour. The attempt to make him\r\nappear as a pagan Christ has been renewed in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of medical practice he succeeded by imposture probably, but\r\nalso in a genuine way by means of suggestion, and no doubt he had also\r\nacquired medical knowledge from study and travelling among people who\r\nhad healing powers and items of medical knowledge perhaps unknown at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n_Vettius (or Vectius) Valleus_, was of equestrian rank but he did not\r\nconfer any honour on the medical profession. He was one of the lewd\r\ncompanions of Messalina, the wife of the Emperor Claudius, and was put\r\nto death in A.D. 48. He was a believer in Themison's doctrines, and is\r\nsaid by Pliny[20] to have founded a new medical sect, but nearly all the\r\nMethodici attempted to create a new sect by adding to, or subtracting a\r\nlittle from, the tenets of Methodism.\r\n\r\n_Scribonius Largus_ (about A.D. 45) was physician to Claudius and\r\naccompanied him to Britain. He wrote several medical books, and is\r\nreputed to have used electricity for the relief of headaches.\r\n\r\n_Andromachus_, the elder, was physician to Nero, and the first\r\narchiater. He was born in Crete. He was the inventor of a compound\r\nmedicine called after himself, \"Theriaca Andromachi.\" He gave\r\ndirections for making it in a poem of 174 lines. This poem is quoted by\r\nGalen, who explains that Andromachus gave his instructions a poetical\r\nform to assist memory, and to prevent the likelihood of alteration.\r\n\r\n_Andromachus_, the younger, was the son of the first archiater, and was,\r\nlike his father, physician to Nero. He wrote a book on Pharmacy, in\r\nthree volumes.\r\n\r\n_Thessalus of Tralles_, in Lydia, lived in Rome in the reign of Nero,\r\nand dedicated one of his books to the Emperor. He was a charlatan with\r\nno medical knowledge, but with a good deal of ability and assurance. He\r\nsaid that medicine surpassed all other arts, and he surpassed all other\r\nphysicians. His father had been a weaver, and in his youth Thessalus\r\nfollowed the same calling, and never had any medical training. This did\r\nnot prevent him, however, from acquiring a great reputation as a doctor,\r\nand making a fortune from medical practice. At first, he associated\r\nhimself with the views of the Methodici, but afterwards amended them as\r\nhe thought fit, until he had convinced the public, and perhaps also\r\nhimself, that he was the founder of a new and true system of medicine.\r\nHe spoke in very disrespectful and violent terms of his predecessors,\r\nand said that no man before him had done anything to advance the science\r\nof medicine. Besides having an endowment of natural shrewdness and\r\nability, he was equipped with great powers of self-advertisement, and\r\ncould cajole the rich and influential. He was an adept in the art of\r\nflattery. Galen often refers to him, and always with contempt. Thessalus\r\nwas able, so he said, to teach the medical art in six months, and he\r\nsurrounded himself with a retinue of artisans, weavers, cooks, butchers,\r\nand so on, who were allowed to kill or cure his patients. Sprengel\r\nstates that, after the time of Thessalus, the doctors of Rome forbore to\r\ntake their pupils with them on professional visits.\r\n\r\nHe began a method of treatment for chronic and obstinate cases. The\r\nfirst three days of the treatment were given up to the use of vegetable\r\ndrugs, emetics, and strict dietary. Then followed fasting, and finally a\r\ncourse of tonics and restoratives. He is said to have used colchicum for\r\ngout. The tomb of Thessalus on the Appian Way was to be seen in Pliny's\r\ntime. It bore the arrogant device \"Conqueror of Physicians.\" The success\r\nof Thessalus seems a proof of the cynical belief that the public take a\r\nman's worth at his own estimate.\r\n\r\nPliny, the elder, lived from A.D. 23 to 79, dying during the eruption of\r\nVesuvius when Pompeii and Herculaneum were destroyed. He was not a\r\nscientific man, but was a prodigious recorder of information on all\r\nsubjects. Much of this information is inaccurate, for he was not able\r\nto discriminate between the true and the false, or to assign to facts\r\ntheir relative value.\r\n\r\nHis great book on Natural History includes many subjects that cannot\r\nproperly be considered as belonging to Natural History. It consists of\r\nthirty-six books and an index, and the author stated that the work dealt\r\nwith twenty thousand important matters, and was compiled from two\r\nthousand volumes.\r\n\r\nAlthough Pliny was not a physician he writes about medicine, and paints\r\na picture of the state of medical knowledge of his time. His own\r\nopinions on the subject are of no value. He believed that magic is a\r\nbranch of medicine, and was optimistic enough to hold that there is a\r\nscore of remedies for every disease. His writings upon the virtues of\r\nmedicines derived from the human body, from fish, and from plants are\r\nmore picturesque than accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] H. N., xxix, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST AND SECOND CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA.\r\n\r\n     Athenæus--Pneumatism--Eclectics--Agathinus--Aretæus--Archigenes--\r\n     Dioscorides--Cassius Felix--Pestilence in Rome--Ancient surgical\r\n     instruments--Herodotus--Heliodorus--Cælius Aurelianus--Soranus--\r\n     Rufus of Ephesus--Marinus--Quintus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Athenæus_, of Cilicia, a Stoic and Peripatetic, founded in Rome the\r\nsect of the _Pneumatists_ about the year A.D. 69. It was inspired by the\r\nphilosophy of Plato. The pneuma, or spirit, was in their opinion the\r\ncause of health and of disease. They believed that dilatation of the\r\narteries drives onward the pneuma, and contraction of the arteries\r\ndrives it in a contrary direction. The pneuma passes from the heart to\r\nthe arteries. Their theories also had reference to the elements. Thus,\r\nthe union of heat and moisture maintains health; heat and dryness cause\r\nacute diseases; cold and moisture cause chronic diseases; cold and\r\ndryness cause mental depression, and at death there are both dryness and\r\ncoldness. In spite of these strange opinions the Pneumatists made some\r\nscientific progress, and recognized some diseases hitherto unknown.\r\nGalen wrote of the Pneumatists: \"They would rather betray their country\r\nthan abjure their opinions.\" The founder of the sect of Pneumatists was\r\na very prolific writer, for the twenty-ninth volume of one of his works\r\nis quoted by Oribasius. The teaching of the Pneumatists speedily gave\r\nway to that of the _Eclectics_, of whom Galen was by far the most\r\ncelebrated. They tried to reconcile the teaching of the Dogmatists,\r\nMethodists, and Empirics, and adopted what they considered to be the\r\nbest teaching of each sect. The Eclectics were very similar to, if not\r\nidentical with, the _Episynthetics_, founded by a pupil of Athenæus, by\r\nname, _Agathinus_. He was a Spartan by birth. He is frequently quoted by\r\nGalen, but none of his writings are extant.\r\n\r\n_Aretæus, the Cappadocian_, practised in Rome in the first century of\r\nour era, in the reign of Nero or Vespasian. He published a book on\r\nmedicine, still extant, which displays a great knowledge of the symptoms\r\nof disease very accurately described, and reliable for purposes of\r\ndiagnosis. He was the first to reveal the glandular nature of the\r\nkidneys, and for the first time employed cantharides as a\r\ncounter-irritant (Portal, vol. i, p. 62). It is not surprising that\r\nAretæus followed rather closely the teaching of Hippocrates, but he\r\nconsidered it right to check some of \"the natural actions\" of the body,\r\nwhich Hippocrates thought were necessary for the restoration of health.\r\nHe was not against phlebotomy, and used strong purgatives and also\r\nnarcotics. He was less tied to the opinions of any sect than the\r\nphysicians of his time, and was both wonderfully accurate in his\r\nopinions and reliable in treatment. Aretæus condemned the operation of\r\ntracheotomy first proposed by Asclepiades, and held \"that the heat of\r\nthe inflammation becomes greater from the wound and contributes to the\r\nsuffocation, and the patient coughs; and even if he escapes this danger,\r\nthe lips of the wound do not unite, for both are cartilaginous and\r\nunable to grow together.\" He believed, also, that elephantiasis was\r\ncontagious. The writings of Aretæus consist of eight books, and there\r\nhave been many editions in various languages. Only a few chapters are\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\n_Archigenes_ was a pupil of Agathinus, and is mentioned by Juvenal. He\r\nwas born in Syria and practised in Rome in the reign of Trajan, A.D.\r\n98-117. He introduced new and very obscure terms into his writings. He\r\nwrote on the pulse, and on this Galen wrote a commentary. He also\r\nproposed a classification of fevers, but his views on this subject were\r\nspeculative theories, and not based upon practical experience and\r\nobservation. To him is due the credit of suggesting opium for the\r\ntreatment of dysentery, and he also described accurately the symptoms\r\nand progress of abscess of the liver. By some authorities he is thought\r\nto have belonged to the sect of the Pneumatici.\r\n\r\n_Dioscorides_ was the author of a famous treatise on Materia Medica. At\r\ndifferent times there were several physicians of this name. He lived\r\nshortly after Pliny in the first century, but there is some doubt as to\r\nthe exact time. His five books were the standard work on Materia Medica\r\nfor many centuries after his death. He compiled an account of all the\r\nmaterials in use medicinally, and gave a description of their properties\r\nand action. This entailed great knowledge and industry, and is of value\r\nas showing what drugs were used in his time. Since then practically the\r\nwhole of Materia Medica has been changed. He held largely to the\r\northodox beliefs of Dogmatism, but a great deal of what he recommends is\r\nnot comprised in the doctrines of this sect, and is decidedly Empirical.\r\nIt is difficult or impossible to identify many of the drugs referred to\r\nby Dioscorides, partly because his descriptions are brief, partly\r\nbecause the mistakes of his predecessors are found in his book.\r\n\r\nHe exercised as much authority in Materia Medica as Galen did in the\r\npractice of medicine, and the successors of each were content, in the\r\nmain, to follow blindly. A large work was published in England in 1806\r\nto illustrate the plants of Greece described in the treatises of\r\nDioscorides.\r\n\r\n_Cassius Felix_ is supposed to have lived in the first century of our\r\nera, but practically nothing is known of his history. He wrote a book on\r\nmedicine consisting of eighty-four questions on medical and physical\r\nsubjects and the answers to them.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 79, after the eruption of Vesuvius, there was a great pestilence\r\nin Rome, which historians ascribed to the pollution of the air by the\r\neruption. Fugitives crowded into Rome from the devastated part of the\r\ncountry, and there was great poverty and an accumulation of filth in the\r\ncity, which was, doubtless, the true cause of the pestilence. Treatment\r\nof fever at that time was very imperfect at the best, and proper means\r\nof prevention and treatment were entirely absent in time of pestilence.\r\nIt has been computed that ten thousand people died daily at that time in\r\nRome and the surrounding district. Excavations at Pompeii have done a\r\ngreat deal to reveal the state of surgical knowledge towards the end of\r\nthe first century of our era. Professor Vulpes has written an account of\r\nthe surgical instruments recovered from the ruins, and there is a\r\ncollection of ancient surgical instruments in the Naples museum. Vaginal\r\nand rectal specula have been found: also a forceps for removing\r\nfractured pieces of bone from the surface of the brain. There is an\r\ninstrument considered by Professor Vulpes to have been used as an artery\r\nforceps. Other instruments discovered are: Forceps for removing tumours;\r\ninstruments for tapping in cases of dropsy (such an instrument was\r\ndescribed by Celsus); seven varieties of probes; bronze catheters; 89\r\nspecimens of pincers; various kinds of knives, bone-elevators, lancets,\r\nspatulas, cauteries, saws, and trephines.[21]\r\n\r\nThere were several physicians and surgeons of the name of _Herodotus_. A\r\nfamous surgeon of that name lived in Rome about A.D. 100. He was a pupil\r\nof Athenæus, and is quoted by Galen and Oribasius. This Herodotus,\r\naccording to Baas, was the discoverer of pomegranate root as a remedy\r\nfor tapeworm.\r\n\r\n_Heliodorus_ was a famous surgeon of Rome, and lived about the same time\r\nas Herodotus. He was the contemporary of Juvenal. He performed internal\r\nurethrotomy, and wrote on amputations, injuries of the head, and hernia.\r\n\r\n_Cælius Aurelianus_ probably lived in the first century of the Christian\r\nera, but some writers believe that he was a contemporary of Galen and a\r\nrival, because the one never mentions nor is mentioned by the other; but\r\nthis view is unnecessarily severe upon the standard of medical ethics\r\nattained by the leaders of the profession in early times. From the style\r\nof his writings, it has been deduced that Cælius Aurelianus was not a\r\nnative of Greece or of Rome. He belonged strictly to the sect of the\r\nMethodici, and his writings are important as revealing very fully the\r\nteaching of this sect. He mentions some diseases not previously\r\ndescribed, and had a good knowledge of symptoms. He divided diseases\r\ninto two classes, acute and chronic, or, more in conformity with the\r\nterminology of the Methodici, those of constriction and those of\r\nrelaxation. Aurelianus did not concern himself with inquiring into the\r\ncausation of diseases. His method was to find out the class to which a\r\ndisease belonged, and to treat it accordingly. He was very practical in\r\nhis views, and did a great deal to place treatment upon a satisfactory\r\nbasis. His chief weakness was his failure to recognize the various\r\ndifferences and gradations, and he attached far too much importance to\r\nthe two classes recognized by his school. He withheld active treatment\r\nuntil he had ascertained to his own satisfaction the class to which the\r\ndisease belonged. Cælius Aurelianus wrote three books on acute diseases\r\nand five on chronic diseases. He cites the case of a patient who was\r\ncured of dropsy by tapping, and of a person who was shot through the\r\nlungs with an arrow and recovered. He agreed with Aretæus in condemning\r\ntracheotomy. His books are not written in a good literary style.\r\n\r\n_Soranus_, of Ephesus, was an eminent physician of the Methodist school,\r\nwho practised in Rome in the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. He wrote a\r\ngreat work on diseases of women, of which a Greek manuscript, copied in\r\nthe fifteenth century, was discovered in La Bibliothèque Royale in Paris\r\nby Dietz, who was commissioned by the Prussian Government to explore the\r\npublic libraries of Europe. The same investigator also discovered\r\nanother copy of the work, in a worse state of preservation however, in\r\nthe Vatican library. Parts of the writings of Soranus are preserved in\r\nthe writings of Oribasius. There is no doubt that Soranus was a very\r\naccomplished obstetrician and gynæcologist. His description of the\r\nuterus and its ligaments and the displacements to which the organ is\r\nliable reveals a practical knowledge of anatomy. Unlike most medical\r\nwriters of ancient times, he did not adopt the method of recording\r\nvarious methods of treatment copied from previous writers, but his\r\ntextbook is systematic. In writing about a disease he begins with a\r\nhistorical introduction, and proceeds to describe its causation,\r\nsymptoms, and course, and the treatment of its various phases. His\r\naccount of obstetrics shows that the art was well understood in his\r\ntime. His work on the subjects of dystocia, inflammation of the uterus,\r\nand prolapse is perhaps the best. He refers also to hysterectomy. It is\r\ninteresting to note that he used the speculum. He describes the\r\nqualifications of a good midwife. She need not know very much anatomy,\r\nbut should have been trained in dietetics, materia medica, and minor\r\nsurgical manipulations, such as version. She should be free from all\r\ncorrupt and criminal practices, temperate, and not superstitious or\r\navaricious.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the subject of inversion of the uterus, Soranus points\r\nout that this condition may be caused by traction on the cord. It is\r\nnoteworthy that he recognized the method of embryotomy as necessary when\r\nother measures had failed.\r\n\r\nIn his time leprosy was very prevalent. It had probably been brought in\r\nthe first place from the East into Italy by Pompey. Some of the remedies\r\nused by Soranus for this disease are to be found in the works of Galen.\r\nSoranus wrote books on other medical subjects, but there is difficulty\r\nin deciding as to what is spurious and what is genuine in the works\r\nattributed to his authorship. There were other physicians of the same\r\nname. Galen quotes a book by Soranus on pharmacy, and Cælius Aurelianus\r\none on fevers. He is also quoted by Tertullian, and by Paulus Ægineta,\r\nwho writes that Soranus was one of the first Greek physicians to\r\ndescribe the guinea-worm. Soranus, in the opinion of St. Augustine, was\r\n_Medicinæ auctor nobilissimus_. He was far removed from the prejudices\r\nand superstitions of his time, as is shown by his denunciation of\r\nmagical incantations.\r\n\r\n_Rufus_, of Ephesus, also lived in the reign of Trajan (A.D. 98-117).\r\nHis books reveal the state of anatomical knowledge at Alexandria before\r\nthe time of Galen. The recurrent nerves were then recently discovered.\r\nHe considered the spleen a useless organ. He understood that pressure on\r\nthe nerves and not on the carotid arteries causes loss of voice, and\r\nthat the nerves proceed from the brain, and are sensory and motor. The\r\nheart, he considered, was the seat of life, and he observed that its\r\nleft ventricle is smaller and thicker than the right. The method of\r\nchecking bleeding from blood-vessels by torsion was known to him. He\r\ndemonstrated the investing membrane of the crystalline lens of the\r\neye.[22] He wrote also a treatise in thirty-seven chapters on gout. Many\r\nof the works of Rufus are lost, but fragments are preserved in other\r\nmedical writings.\r\n\r\n_Marinus_ was an anatomist and physician who lived in the first and\r\nsecond centuries after Christ. Quintus was one of his pupils.\r\n\r\nMarinus wrote twenty volumes on anatomy, of which Galen gives an\r\nabridgment and analysis. Galen says that Marinus was one of the\r\nrestorers of anatomical science. Marinus investigated the glands and\r\ncompared them to sponges, and he imagined that their function was to\r\nmoisten and lubricate the surrounding structures. He discovered the\r\nglands of the intestines. He also wrote a commentary on the aphorisms of\r\nHippocrates. It is uncertain if he is the Postumius Marinus who was\r\nphysician to the younger Pliny.\r\n\r\n_Quintus_ was renowned in Rome in the first half of the second century\r\nafter Christ. Like Galen he suffered from the jealousy and persecution\r\nof his professional rivals, who trumped up a charge against him of\r\nkilling his patients, and he had to flee from the city. He was known as\r\nan expert anatomist, but published no medical writings. It has been\r\nstated by some of the writers on the history of medicine that Quintus\r\nwas the tutor of Galen, but this statement is lacking in definite\r\nproof.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] For full description and plates see Dr. John Stewart Milne's\r\n\"Surgical Instruments in Greek and Roman Times\" (Clarendon Press, 1907).\r\n\r\n[22] \"Portal,\" vol. i, p. 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nGALEN.\r\n\r\n     His life and works--His influence on Medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Claudius Galenus_, commonly known as Galen, has influenced the progress\r\nof medical science by his writings probably more than any other medical\r\nwriter. His influence was paramount for fourteen centuries, and although\r\nhe made some original contributions, his works are noteworthy mainly as\r\nan encyclopædia of the medical knowledge of his time and as a review of\r\nthe work of his predecessors. There is a great deal of information in\r\nhis books about his own life. He was born at Pergamos in A.D. 130 in the\r\nreign of Hadrian. His father was a scholar and his mother somewhat of a\r\nshrew. Galen, in his boyhood, learned much from his father's example and\r\ninstruction, and at the age of 15 was taught by philosophers of the\r\nStoic, Platonist, Peripatetic, and Epicurean schools. He became\r\ninitiated, writes Dr. Moore, into \"the idealism of Plato, the realism of\r\nAristotle, the scepticism of the Epicureans, and the materialism of the\r\nStoics.\" At the age of 17 he was destined for the profession of medicine\r\nby his father in consequence of a dream. He studied under the most\r\neminent men of his day. He went to Smyrna to be a pupil of Pelops, the\r\nphysician, and Albinus the platonist; to Corinth to study under\r\nNumesianus; to Alexandria for the lectures of Heraclianus; and to\r\nCilicia, Phoenicia, Palestine, Crete, and Cyprus. At the age of 29 Galen\r\nreturned from Alexandria to Pergamos (A.D. 158), and was appointed\r\ndoctor to the School of Gladiators, and gained much distinction.\r\n\r\nHe went to Rome for the first time in A.D. 163-4, and remained for four\r\nyears; and during this period he wrote on anatomy and on the teaching of\r\nHippocrates and Plato. He acquired great fame as a practitioner and, if\r\nhe had so desired, might have attended the Emperor; but it is probable\r\nthat Galen thought that the office of physician to the Emperor might\r\nprevent him from leaving Rome if he wished to do so. He also gave public\r\nlectures and disputations, and was called not only the \"wonder-speaker\"\r\nbut the \"wonder-worker.\" His success gave rise to envy, and he was\r\nafraid of being poisoned by his less successful rivals. The reason why\r\nhe left Rome is not certain, and the possible causes of his departure\r\nare discussed by Dr. Greenhill in the \"Dictionary of Greek and Roman\r\nBiography and Mythology.\" A pestilence raged in Rome at this time, but\r\nit is unlikely that Galen would have deserted his patients for that\r\nreason. Probably he disliked Rome, and longed for his native place. He\r\nhad been in Pergamos only a very short time when he was summoned to\r\nattend the Emperors Marcus Aurelius and L. Verus in Venetia. The latter\r\ndied of apoplexy on his way home to Rome, and Galen followed Marcus\r\nAurelius to the capital. The Emperor soon thereafter set out to\r\nprosecute the war on the Danube, and Galen was allowed to remain in\r\nRome, as he had stated that such was the will of Æsculapius. The\r\nEmperor's son Commodus was placed under the care of Galen during the\r\nfather's absence, and at this time also (A.D. 170) Galen prepared the\r\nfamous medicine _theriaca_ for Marcus Aurelius, who took a small\r\nquantity daily. The Emperor Septimius Severus employed the same\r\nphysician and the same medicine about thirty years afterwards. It is\r\nrecorded that the philosopher Eudemius was successfully treated by Galen\r\nfor a severe illness caused by an overdose of theriaca, and that the\r\ntreatment employed was the same drug in small doses.\r\n\r\nGalen stayed several years in Rome, and wrote and practised as on his\r\nformer visit. He again returned to Pergamos, and probably was in Rome\r\nagain at the end of the second century. It is certain he was still alive\r\nin the year 199, and probably lived in the reign of the Emperor\r\nCaracalla.\r\n\r\nHe was not only a great physician, but a man of wide culture in every\r\nway. In matters of religion he was a Monotheist. There was persecution\r\nof the Christians in his day, and it is likely that he came little into\r\ncontact with the disciples of the new religion, and heard distorted\r\naccounts of it, but in one of his lost books, quoted by his Arabian\r\nbiographers, Galen praises highly the love of virtue of the Christians.\r\n\r\nHe no doubt found the practice of medicine lucrative when he had gained\r\npre-eminence, and it is recorded that he received £350 for curing the\r\nwife of Boetius, the Consul.\r\n\r\nGalen wrote no less than five hundred treatises, large and small, mostly\r\non medical subjects, but also on ethics, logic, and grammar. His style\r\nis good but rather diffuse, and he delights in quoting the ancient Greek\r\nphilosophers. Before his time, as we have seen, there were disputes\r\nbetween the various medical sects. The disciples of Dogmatism and of\r\nEmpiricism had been opposed to each other for several centuries, and the\r\nEclectics, Pneumatists, and Episynthetics had arisen shortly before his\r\ntime. Galen wrote against slavish attachment to any sect, but \"in his\r\ngeneral principles he may be considered as belonging to the Dogmatic\r\nsect, for his method was to reduce all his knowledge, as acquired by the\r\nobservation of facts, to general theoretical principles. These\r\nprinciples he, indeed, professed to deduce from experience and\r\nobservation, and we have abundant proofs of his diligence in collecting\r\nexperience, and his accuracy in making observations; but still in a\r\ncertain sense at least, he regards individual facts and the details of\r\nexperience as of little value, unconnected with the principles which he\r\nhad laid down as the basis of all medical reasoning. In this fundamental\r\npoint, therefore, the method pursued by Galen appears to have been\r\ndirectly the reverse of that which we now consider as the correct method\r\nof scientific investigation; and yet, such is the force of natural\r\ngenius, that in most instances he attained the ultimate object in view,\r\nalthough by an indirect path. He was an admirer of Hippocrates, and\r\nalways speaks of him with the most profound respect, professing to act\r\nupon his principles, and to do little more than expound his doctrines,\r\nand support them by new facts and observations. Yet, in reality, we have\r\nfew writers whose works, both as to substance and manner, are more\r\ndifferent from each other than those of Hippocrates and Galen, the\r\nsimplicity of the former being strongly contrasted with the abstruseness\r\nand refinement of the latter.\"[23]\r\n\r\nA list of the various editions of Galen's works is given in Dr. Smith's\r\n\"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology\" (1890 edition,\r\nvol. ii, pp. 210-12), and also the titles of the treatises classified\r\naccording to the branch of medical science with which they deal, and it\r\nis convenient to follow this classification.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--WORKS ON ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY.\r\n\r\nGalen insisted upon the study of anatomy as essential, and in this\r\nrespect was in conflict with the view held by the Methodists and the\r\nEmpirics who believed that a physician could understand diseases without\r\nany knowledge of the exact structure of the body. His books on anatomy\r\nwere originally fifteen in number. The last six of these are now extant\r\nonly in an Arabic translation, two copies of which are preserved in the\r\nBodleian Library at Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe directions he gives for dissection show that he was a master of the\r\nart. In dissecting out the portal vein and its ramifications, for\r\ninstance, he advises that a probe should be inserted into the vein, and\r\nthe point of the probe gradually advanced as the surrounding tissue is\r\ncut away, so that finally the minute branches are exposed; and he\r\ndescribes the use of the blowpipe, and other instruments used in\r\ndissection. He carried out the experiment of tying the iliac and\r\naxillary arteries in animals, and found that this procedure stopped the\r\npulse in the leg and arm, but caused no serious symptoms, and he found\r\nthat even the carotid arteries could be tied without causing death. He\r\nalso pointed out that tying the carotid artery did not cause loss of\r\nvoice, but that tying the artery carelessly so as to include the nerve\r\nhad this effect. He was the first to describe the ductus arteriosus, and\r\nthe three coats of the arteries.\r\n\r\nIt is highly improbable that Galen dissected human bodies in Rome,\r\nthough he dissected a great variety of the lower animals. He writes that\r\nthe doctors who attended Marcus Aurelius in the German wars dissected\r\nthe dead bodies of the barbarians. The chief mistakes made by Galen as\r\nan anatomist were due to his assumption that what is true of the anatomy\r\nof a lower animal is true also when applied to man.\r\n\r\nGalen greatly assisted the advance of physiology by recognizing that\r\nevery part of the body exists for the purpose of performing a definite\r\nfunction. Aristotle, like Plato, had taught that \"Nature makes nothing\r\nin vain,\" and Galen's philosophy was greatly influenced by the teaching\r\nof Aristotle. Galen regarded his work as \"a religious hymn in honour of\r\nthe Creator, who has given proof of His Omnipotence in creating\r\neverything perfectly conformable to its destination.\"\r\n\r\nHe regarded the structure of various parts, such as the hand and the\r\nmembranes of the brain, as absolute perfection, although his idea of the\r\nhuman hand was derived from a study of the ape's, and he had no\r\nknowledge of the arachnoid membrane of the brain, but it would be unfair\r\nto criticize his conclusions because of his failure to recognize a few\r\ncomparatively unimportant details. He discovered the function of the\r\nmotor nerves by cutting them experimentally, and so producing paralysis\r\nof the muscles; the platysma, interossei, and popliteus muscles were\r\nfirst described by him. He was the greatest authority on the pulse, and\r\nhe recognized that it consisted of a diastole (expansion) and a systole\r\n(contraction) with an interval after the diastole, and another after the\r\nsystole. Aristotle thought that arteries contained air, but Galen taught\r\nthat they contained blood, for, when an artery was wounded, blood gushed\r\nout. He was not far from the discovery of the circulation. He described\r\nthe heart as having the appearance of a muscle, and considered it the\r\nsource of natural heat, and the seat of violent passions. He knew well\r\nthe anatomy of the human skeleton, and advised students to go to\r\nAlexandria where they might see and handle and properly study the bones.\r\nHe recognized that inspiration is associated with enlargement of the\r\nchest, and imagined that air passed inside the skull through the\r\ncribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, and passed out by the same\r\nchannel, carrying off humours from the brain into the nose. But some of\r\nthis air remained and combined with the vital spirits in the anterior\r\nventricles of the brain, and finally exuded from the fourth ventricle,\r\nthe residence of the soul. Aristotle had taught that the heart was the\r\nseat of the soul, and the brain relatively unimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--WORKS ON DIETETICS AND HYGIENE.\r\n\r\nGalen was a strong advocate of exercises and gymnastics, and eulogizes\r\nhunting specially. He recommends cold baths for people in the prime of\r\nlife. As old age is \"cold and dry,\" this is to be treated with hot baths\r\nand the drinking of wine. He thought that wine was particularly suitable\r\nfor the aged, and that old people required three meals a day, others two\r\nmeals. He had a very high opinion of pork as an article of diet, and\r\nsaid that the strength of athletes could not be maintained without this\r\nform of food.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--ON PATHOLOGY.\r\n\r\nGalen believed in the doctrine of the four elements, and his\r\nspeculations led him into a belief in a further subdivision. \"Fire is\r\nhot and dry; air is hot and moist; for the air is like a vapour; water\r\nis cold and moist, and earth is cold and dry.\" He held that there were\r\nthree principles in man--spirits, solids, and humours--and eight\r\ntemperaments ranging between health and disease and compatible with\r\nlife. He retained a good deal of the teaching of the Pneumatic school,\r\nand believed that the _pneuma_ was different from the soul, but the\r\nvehicle for the interaction of soul and body. From his theory of the\r\naction of the air through the nose on the contents of the ventricles of\r\nthe brain is explained his use of sternutatories, and his belief in the\r\nefficacy of sneezing. Galen's classification of inflammations shows that\r\nhis pathology was not nearly so accurate as his anatomy and physiology.\r\nHe described (_a_) simple inflammation caused by excess of blood alone;\r\n(_b_) inflammation the result of excess of both pneuma and blood; (_c_)\r\nerysipelatous inflammation when yellow bile gains admission, and (_d_)\r\nscirrhous or cancerous when phlegm is present. He did good service by\r\ndividing the causes of disease into remote and proximate, the former\r\nsubdivided into two classes--predisposing and exciting.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--ON DIAGNOSIS.\r\n\r\nHe relied greatly on the doctrine of \"critical days,\" which were thought\r\nto be influenced to some extent by the moon. His studies of the pulse\r\nwere very useful to him in diagnosis. No doubt, he was an expert\r\ndiagnostician mainly owing to his long, varied, and costly medical\r\neducation, and his great natural powers of judgment. He asserted that\r\nwith the help of the Deity he had never been wrong, but even his most\r\nardent admirers would not be wanting in enthusiasm if they amended\r\n\"never\" into \"hardly ever.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--ON PHARMACY, MATERIA MEDICA, AND THERAPEUTICS.\r\n\r\nIn these subjects Galen was not as proficient as Dioscorides, whose\r\nteaching he adopted with that of other medical authors. In Galen's works\r\nthere are lengthy lists of compound medicines, several medicines being\r\nrecommended for the same disease, and never with very marked\r\nconfidence. He paid high prices for various nostrums, and, sad to\r\nrelate, placed great faith in amulets, belief in which was general in\r\nhis time, and nowhere held more strongly than in superstitious Rome.\r\nMedicines were classified by him according to their qualities, by which\r\nhe meant, not their therapeutic effects, but their inherent dryness or\r\nmoistness, coldness or heat. A medicine might be cold in the first\r\ndegree, and not in the second degree. Paulus Ægineta followed this\r\nstrange and foolish doctrine of Galen very closely, as the following\r\nextracts from his book on Materia Medica will show:--\r\n\r\n\"Cistus (rock-rose).--It is an astringent shrub of gently cooling\r\npowers. Its leaves and shoots are so desiccative as to agglutinate\r\nwounds; but the flowers are of a more drying nature, being about the\r\nsecond degree; and hence, when drunk, they cure dysenteries and all\r\nkinds of fluxes.\"[24]\r\n\r\n\"Ferrum (iron).--When frequently extinguished in water, it imparts a\r\nconsiderable desiccative power to it. When drunk, therefore, it agrees\r\nwith affections of the spleen.\"[25]\r\n\r\nMany features, however, of Galen's teaching and practice of therapeutics\r\nare worthy of praise. He enunciated two fundamental principles: (1) That\r\ndisease is something contrary to Nature, and is to be overcome by that\r\nwhich is contrary \"to the disease itself\"; and (2) that Nature is to be\r\npreserved by what has relation with Nature. He recognized that while the\r\ninvading disease was to be repelled, the strength and constitution of\r\nthe patient should be preserved, and that in all cases the cause of the\r\ndisease was to be treated and not the symptoms. Strong remedies should\r\nnot be used on weak patients.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--SURGERY.\r\n\r\nGalen conformed to the custom of the physicians in Rome, and did not\r\npractise surgery to any extent, although he used the lancet in\r\nphlebotomy, and defended this practice against the followers of\r\nErasistratus in Rome. He is said to have resected a portion of the\r\nsternum for caries, and also to have ligatured the temporal artery.[26]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--GYNÆCOLOGY.\r\n\r\nGalen had little more than a superficial knowledge of this subject, and\r\nwas quite ignorant of the surgery of diseases of women. He was not so\r\nwell informed as Soranus was as to the anatomy of the uterus and its\r\nappendages, but deserves credit for having been better acquainted with\r\nthe anatomy of the Fallopian tubes than his predecessors. He had\r\nerroneous views on the causation of displacements of the uterus. Several\r\nof the books inaccurately attributed to the authorship of Galen deal\r\nwith the medical treatment of various minor ailments of women.\r\n\r\nGalen was a man of wide culture, and one of his essays is written for\r\nthe purpose of urging physicians to become acquainted with other\r\nbranches of knowledge besides medicine. As a philosopher he has been\r\nquoted in company with Plato and Aristotle, and his philosophical\r\nwritings were greatly used by Arabic authors. In philosophy, as in\r\nmedicine, he had studied the teachings of the various schools of\r\nthought, and did not bind himself to any sect in particular. He\r\ndisagreed with the Sceptics in their belief that no such thing as\r\ncertainty was attainable, and it was his custom in cases of extreme\r\ndifficulty to suspend his judgment; for instance, in reference to the\r\nnature of the soul, he wrote that he had not been able to come to a\r\ndefinite opinion.\r\n\r\nGalen mentions the discreditable conduct of physicians at consultations.\r\nSometimes several doctors would hold a consultation, and, apparently\r\nforgetting the patient for the time, would hold violent disputations.\r\nTheir main object was to display their dialectical skill, and their\r\narguments sometimes led to blows. These discreditable exhibitions were\r\nrather frequent in Rome in his time.\r\n\r\nWith Galen, as with Hippocrates, it is sometimes impossible to tell what\r\nworks are genuine, and what are spurious. He seemed to think that he was\r\nthe successor of Hippocrates, and wrote: \"No one before me has given the\r\ntrue method of treating disease: Hippocrates, I confess, has heretofore\r\nshown the path, but as he was the first to enter it, he was not able to\r\ngo as far as he wished.... He has not made all the necessary\r\ndistinctions, and is often obscure, as is usually the case with ancients\r\nwhen they attempt to be concise. He says very little of complicated\r\ndiseases; in a word, he has only sketched what another was to complete;\r\nhe has opened the path, but has left it for a successor to enlarge and\r\nmake it plain.\" Galen strictly followed Hippocrates in the latter's\r\nhumoral theory of pathology, and also in therapeutics to a great extent.\r\n\r\nIt is a speculation of much interest how it was that Galen's views on\r\nMedicine received universal acceptance, and made him the dictator in\r\nthis realm of knowledge for ages after his death. He was not precisely a\r\ngenius, though a very remarkable man, and he established no sect of his\r\nown. The reason of his power lay in the fact that his writings supplied\r\nan encyclopædic knowledge of the medical art down to his own time, with\r\ncommentaries and additions of his own, written with great assurance and\r\nconveying an impression of finality, for he asserted that he had\r\nfinished what Hippocrates had begun. The world was tired of political\r\nand philosophical strife, and waiting for authority. The wars of Rome\r\nhad resulted in placing political power in the hands of one man, the\r\nEmperor; the disputations and bickerings of philosophers and physicians\r\nproduced a similar result, and Galen, in the medical world was invested\r\nwith the purple.\r\n\r\nThe effect, therefore, of Galen's writings was, at first, to add to and\r\nconsolidate medical knowledge, but his influence soon became an obstacle\r\nto progress. Even in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Galenism\r\nheld almost undisputed sway.\r\n\r\nThe house of Galen stood opposite the Temple of Romulus in the Roman\r\nForum. This temple, in A.D. 530, was consecrated by Pope Felix IV to the\r\nhonour of the saints, Cosma and Damiano, two Arabian _anargyri_ (unpaid\r\nphysicians) who suffered martyrdom under Diocletian.\r\n\r\nThe date of Galen's death is not exactly known, but was probably A.D.\r\n200.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] Dr. Bostock's \"History of Medicine.\"\r\n\r\n[24] \"Paulus Ægineta,\" vol. iii, p. 74.\r\n\r\n[25] _Ibid._, p. 242.\r\n\r\n[26] \"Encyl. Brit.,\" Surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE LATER ROMAN AND BYZANTINE PERIOD.\r\n\r\n     Beginning of Decline--Neoplatonism--Antyllus--Oribasius--Magnus--\r\n     Jacobus Psychristus--Adamantius--Meletius--Nemesius--Ætius--\r\n     Alexander of Tralles--The Plague--Moschion--Paulus Ægineta--Decline\r\n     of Healing Art.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of Galen marks the beginning of the decline of medical science\r\nin ancient times, and this decline was contemporaneous with the\r\noverthrow of the Roman State. As everybody knows, the decline and fall\r\nof the Roman Empire resulted from the profligacy and incapacity of the\r\nemperors, luxurious living and vice among the people, tyranny of an\r\noverbearing soldiery at home, and the attacks of barbarian foes\r\ngradually increasing in strength. Rome fell quickly into the hands of\r\nthe barbarians, and her power was broken. In A.D. 395, was founded the\r\nByzantine Empire, also styled the East Roman, Greek, or Lower Empire,\r\nwhich lasted for more than a thousand years, and took its name from the\r\ncapital, Byzantium or Constantinople. In this empire medical science\r\nmaintained a feeble and sickly existence. During this _Byzantine Period_\r\nthere were a few physicians of note, but they were mainly commentators,\r\nand medical science retrograded rather than progressed.\r\n\r\n_Neoplatonism_ exerted a powerful influence upon the healing art. It was\r\nfounded by Plotinus, and was for three centuries a formidable rival to\r\nChristianity. The Neoplatonists believed that man could intuitively know\r\nthe absolute by a faculty called _Ecstasy_. Neoplatonism is a term which\r\ncovers a very wide range of varying thought; essentially, it was a\r\ncombination of philosophy and religion, arising from the intellectual\r\nmovement in Alexandria. It covered a great deal of mysticism, magic and\r\nspiritualism, and the followers of the system, as it developed, became\r\nbelievers in the efficacy of certain exercises and symbols to cure\r\ndiseases. They entered as Kingsley wrote, \"the fairy land of ecstasy,\r\nclairvoyance, insensibility to pain, cures produced by the effect of\r\nwhat we now call mesmerism. They are all there, these modern puzzles, in\r\nthose old books of the long bygone seekers for wisdom.\" It is wonderful\r\nhow mankind in their pursuit of knowledge seem to have progressed in a\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nThe influence which Christianity exerted upon the investigation of\r\nmedical science during the early centuries of our era will be considered\r\nat length in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n_Antyllus_ was perhaps the greatest surgeon of antiquity. He lived\r\nbefore the end of the fourth century A.D., for he is quoted by\r\nOribasius, but is not mentioned by Galen. The time in which he lived was\r\nabout the year A.D. 300. He was a voluminous writer, but his works have\r\nperished except for quotations by later writers. The fragments of his\r\nwritings were collected and published in 1799. Antyllus performed an\r\noperation for aneurism, which consisted in laying open the sac, turning\r\nout the clots, securing the vessels above and below, and allowing the\r\nwound to heal by granulation. As this operation was performed without\r\nanæsthetics or antiseptics it was attended with great mortality, and the\r\nrisk of secondary hæmorrhage was very great. Antyllus had operations for\r\nthe cure of stammering, for cataract, and for the treatment of\r\ncontractures by the method of tenotomy. He also removed enlarged glands\r\nof the neck. It was part of the practice of Antyllus to ligature\r\narteries before cutting them, a method which was subsequently\r\n\"rediscovered\" owing to neglect of the study of the history of medicine.\r\nHe gave directions for avoiding the carotid artery and internal jugular\r\nvein in operations upon the neck.\r\n\r\nA fragment of the writings of Antyllus is preserved by Paulus\r\nÆgineta,[27] and shows the quality of the work done in bygone ages. It\r\nis his description of the operation of tracheotomy, and runs as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"When we proceed to perform this operation we must cut through some part\r\nof the windpipe, below the larynx, about the third or fourth ring; for\r\nto divide the whole would be dangerous. This place is commodious,\r\nbecause it is not covered with any flesh, and because it has no vessels\r\nsituated near the divided part. Therefore, bending the head of the\r\npatient backward, so that the windpipe may come more forward to the\r\nview, we make a transverse section between two of the rings, so that in\r\nthis case not the cartilage but the membrane which unites the cartilages\r\ntogether, is divided. If the operator be a little timid, he may first\r\nstretch the skin with a hook and divide it; then, proceeding to the\r\nwindpipe, and separating the vessels, if any are in the way, he may make\r\nthe incision.\" This operation had been proposed by Asclepiades about\r\nthree hundred years before the time of Antyllus.\r\n\r\n_Oribasius_ was born at Pergamos, the birthplace of Galen, about A.D.\r\n326. He studied under _Zenon_, who lectured and practised at Alexandria,\r\nand was expelled by the bishop, but afterwards reinstated by command of\r\nthe Emperor Julian (A.D. 361). When Julian was kept in confinement in\r\nAsia Minor, Oribasius became acquainted with him, and they were soon\r\nclose friends. When Julian was raised to the rank of Cæsar, Oribasius\r\naccompanied him into Gaul. During this journey Oribasius, at the request\r\nof his patron, made an epitome of the writings of Galen, and then\r\nextended the work by including a collection of the writings of all\r\npreceding medical authors. When this work was finally completed it\r\nconsisted of seventy books under the title \"Collecta Medicinalia.\" He\r\nwrote also for his friend and biographer Eunapius two books on diseases\r\nand their treatment, and treatises on anatomy and on the works of Galen.\r\nHe earned for himself the title of the Ape of Galen. In the \"Life of\r\nOribasius,\" by Eunapius, we find that Julian created Oribasius Quæstor\r\nof Constantinople, but after the death of Julian, Oribasius was exiled,\r\nand practised among the \"barbarians,\" attaining great fame. In his exile\r\nhe married a rich woman of good family, and to one of his sons,\r\nEustathius by name, he addressed an abridgment of his first great book,\r\nthe smaller work being called the \"Synopsis.\" He ultimately returned\r\nfrom exile, and again reached a very honourable position, to which he\r\nwas well entitled in virtue of the great fortitude with which he had\r\nborne adversity.\r\n\r\nAn edition of Oribasius was published at Paris between 1851 and 1876, in\r\nsix volumes, by Daremberg and Bussemaker, under the patronage of the\r\nFrench Government. The authors of this edition took infinite pains to\r\nshow the sources from which the writings of Oribasius had been derived,\r\nchief of which were the original writings of Galen, Hippocrates,\r\nSoranus, Rufus, and Antyllus. Oribasius was almost entirely a compiler,\r\nbut also did some original work. To him is due the credit of describing\r\nthe drum of the ear and the salivary glands. He described also the\r\nstrange disease called lycanthropy, a form of insanity in which the\r\npatient thinks himself a wolf, and leaves his home at night to wander\r\namongst the tombs.\r\n\r\nOribasius was held to be the wisest man of his time. There was something\r\nvery charming in his manner and conversation, and the barbarians\r\nconsidered him as little less than a god.\r\n\r\n_Magnus_, a native of Mesopotamia, was a pupil of Zenon and lectured at\r\nAlexandria. He was famous for his eloquence and dialectical skill, and\r\nwrote a book on \"Urine\" which is referred to by Theophilus.\r\n\r\n_Jacobus Psychristus_ was a famous physician who practised at\r\nConstantinople, A.D. 457-474. He was called \"the Saviour\" because of the\r\ngreat success of his treatment.\r\n\r\n_Adamantius_ of Alexandria both taught and practised medicine. He was a\r\nJewish physician who was expelled from Alexandria in A.D. 415, and\r\nsettled in Constantinople.\r\n\r\n_Meletius_ was a Christian monk who lived in the fourth century,\r\naccording to some authorities, but it is probable that he belonged to a\r\nlater period, the sixth or seventh century. He wrote on the nature of\r\nman, but the book is of no value as a contribution to physiology.\r\n\r\n_Nemesius_, Bishop of Emissa, at the end of the fourth century wrote a\r\nbook called \"De Natura Hominis,\" and came very close to two important\r\ndiscoveries, namely, the functions of the bile and the circulation of\r\nthe blood. Of the former, he wrote, \"The yellow bile is constituted both\r\nfor itself and for other purposes; for it contributes to digestion and\r\npromotes the expulsion of the excrements; and therefore it is in a\r\nmanner one of the nutritive organs, besides imparting a sort of heat to\r\nthe body, like the vital power. For these reasons, therefore, it seems\r\nto be made for itself; but, inasmuch as it purges the blood, it seems to\r\nbe made in a manner for this also.\"[28]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the circulation of the blood, Nemesius wrote: \"The\r\nmotion of the pulse (called also the vital power) takes its rise from\r\nthe heart and chiefly from its left ventricle. The artery is with great\r\nvehemence dilated and contracted, by a sort of constant harmony and\r\norder, the motion commencing at the heart. While it is dilated it draws\r\nwith force the thinner part of the blood from the neighbouring veins,\r\nthe exhalation or vapour of which blood becomes the aliment for the\r\nvital spirit. But while it is contracted it exhales whatever fumes it\r\nhas through the whole body and by secret passages, as the heart throws\r\nout whatever is fuliginous through the mouth and nose by\r\nexpiration.\"[29]\r\n\r\nThis book was first translated into English in 1636.\r\n\r\nNemesius also wrote on religion and philosophy. In regard to his medical\r\nwritings, although he did not go far enough to anticipate the discovery\r\nof Harvey, his contribution to medical science was remarkable.\r\n\r\n_Ætius_ was born in Mesopotamia and lived at the end of the fifth or the\r\nbeginning of the sixth century. He studied at Alexandria, and settled at\r\nConstantinople, where he attained to the honour of court chamberlain,\r\nand physician to the Emperor Justinian. He was the first notable\r\nphysician to profess Christianity. In compounding medicines, he\r\nrecommended that the following prayer should be repeated in a low voice:\r\n\"May the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob deign to\r\nbestow upon this medicament such and such virtues.\" To extract a piece\r\nof bone sticking in the throat, the physician should call out loudly:\r\n\"As Jesus Christ drew Lazarus from the grave, and as Jonah came out of\r\nthe whale, thus Blasius, the martyr and servant of God, commands, 'Bone,\r\ncome up or go down.'\"\r\n\r\nÆtius wrote the \"Sixteen Books on Medicine,\" and these contain original\r\nmatter, but are of value mainly as being a compilation of the medical\r\nknowledge of his time. He was the first writer to mention certain\r\nEastern drugs, such as cloves and camphor, and had a great knowledge of\r\nthe spells and charms used in the East, more especially by the Egyptian\r\nChristians. All the nostrums, amulets and charms that were used at the\r\ntime are enumerated, and display a gloomy picture of the superstition\r\nand ignorance that prevailed. The surgical and gynæcological sections of\r\nthe writings of Ætius are, in most parts, excellent. He treated cut\r\narteries by twisting or tying, and advised the irrigation of wounds with\r\ncold water. In the operation of lithotomy he recommended that the blade\r\nof the knife should be guarded by a tube. He used the seton and the\r\ncautery, which was much in vogue in his day, especially in cases of\r\nparalysis. He quotes Archigenes, who wrote: \"I should not at all\r\nhesitate to make an eschar in the nape of the neck, where the spinal\r\nmarrow takes its rise, two on each side of it ... and if the ulcers\r\ncontinue running a good while, I should not doubt of a perfect\r\nrecovery.\"\r\n\r\n_Alexander of Tralles_ lived from A.D. 525 to 605. He was the son of a\r\nphysician, and one of five brothers, who were all distinguished for\r\nscholarship. He studied philosophy as well as medicine, and travelled in\r\nFrance, Spain, and Italy to extend his knowledge. He took up permanent\r\nresidence in Rome, and became very celebrated. When he became too old to\r\ncontinue active practice, he found leisure to write twelve books on\r\nmedical diseases, following to some extent the teaching of Galen. The\r\nstyle of these books is elegant, and his description of diseases\r\naccurate. Alexander of Tralles was the first to open the jugular vein\r\nin disease, and employed iron and other useful remedies, but he lived\r\nin superstitious times, and was very credulous. For epilepsy, he\r\nrecommended a piece of sail from a wrecked vessel, worn round the arm\r\nfor seven weeks.[30] For colic, he recommended the heart of a lark\r\nattached to the right thigh, and for pain in the kidneys an amulet\r\ndepicting Hercules overcoming a lion. To exorcise gout, he used\r\nincantations, these being either oral or written on a thin sheet of gold\r\nduring the waning of the moon. Writing a suitable inscription on an\r\nolive leaf, gathered before sunrise, was his specific for ague.\r\nAlexander appears at times to have doubted the efficacy of such remedies\r\nas amulets, for he explains that his rich patients would not submit to\r\nrational treatment, and it was necessary, therefore, to use other\r\nmethods reputed to be curative.\r\n\r\nIn the age of Justinian great scourges devastated the world. In A.D. 526\r\nAntioch was destroyed by an earthquake, and it is said that 250,000\r\npeople perished, but the most dreadful visitation on mankind was the\r\ngreat plague which raged in A.D. 542 and the following years, and, as\r\nGibbon writes, \"depopulated the earth in the time of Justinian and his\r\nsuccessors.\" _Procopius_, who was versed in medicine, was the historian\r\nof the period. This fell disease began between the Serbonian bog and\r\nthe eastern channel of the Nile. \"From thence, tracing as it were a\r\ndouble path, it spread to the east, over Syria, Persia, and the Indies,\r\nand penetrated to the west, along the coast of Africa, and over the\r\ncontinent of Europe. In the spring of the second year, Constantinople,\r\nduring three or four months, was visited by the pestilence; and\r\nProcopius, who observed its progress and symptoms with the eyes of a\r\nphysician, has emulated the skill and diligence of Thucydides in the\r\nlatter's description of the plague of Athens. The infection was\r\nsometimes announced by the visions of a distempered fancy, and the\r\nvictim despaired as soon as he had heard the menace and felt the stroke\r\nof an invisible spectre. But the greater number, in their beds, in the\r\nstreets, in their usual occupation, were surprised by a slight fever, so\r\nslight, indeed, that neither the pulse nor the colour of the patient\r\ngave any signs of the approaching danger. The same, the next, or the\r\nsucceeding day, it was declared by the swelling of the glands,\r\nparticularly those of the groin, of the armpits, and under the ear; and\r\nwhen these buboes or tumours were opened they were found to contain a\r\n_coal_, or black substance, of the size of a lentil. If they came to a\r\nfirst swelling and suppuration, the patient was saved by this kind and\r\nnatural discharge of the morbid humour. But if they continued hard and\r\ndry, a mortification quickly ensued, and the fifth day was commonly the\r\nterm of his life. The fever was often accompanied with lethargy or\r\ndelirium; the bodies of the sick were covered with black pustules or\r\ncarbuncles, the symptoms of immediate death; and in the constitutions\r\ntoo feeble to produce an eruption, the vomiting of blood was followed by\r\na mortification of the bowels. To pregnant women the plague was\r\ngenerally mortal; yet one infant was drawn alive from its dead mother,\r\nand three mothers survived the loss of their infected foetus. Youth was\r\nthe most perilous season: and the female sex was less susceptible than\r\nthe male; but every rank and profession was attacked with indiscriminate\r\nrage, and many of those who escaped were deprived of their speech,\r\nwithout being secure from a return of the disorder. The physicians of\r\nConstantinople were zealous and skilful, but their art was baffled by\r\nthe various symptoms and pertinacious vehemence of the disease; the same\r\nremedies were productive of contrary effects and the event capriciously\r\ndisappointed their prognostics of death or recovery. The order of\r\nfunerals and the right of sepulchres were confounded; those who were\r\nleft without friends or servants lay unburied in the streets, or in\r\ntheir desolate houses; and a magistrate was authorized to collect the\r\npromiscuous heaps of dead bodies, to transport them by land or water,\r\nand to inter them in deep pits beyond the precincts of the city.... No\r\nfacts have been preserved to sustain an account, or even a conjecture,\r\nof the number that perished in this extraordinary mortality. I only\r\nfind, that during three months 5,000, and at length 10,000, persons died\r\neach day at Constantinople; that many cities of the East were left\r\nvacant, and that in several districts of Italy the harvest and the\r\nvintage withered on the ground.\"[31]\r\n\r\nThe spread of disease from East to West was again exemplified in the\r\nMiddle Ages, in the time of the Crusades, when the Crusaders carried\r\nhome diseases to their native lands. The Knights of St. John, it is\r\ninteresting to observe, superintended hospitals at home, and wore the\r\nwhite dress which in earlier times had distinguished the Asclepiades.\r\n\r\n_Moschion_ probably lived in the sixth century, and was a specialist in\r\ndiseases of women. His writings were studied when Soranus was forgotten,\r\nbut in course of time it was discovered that Moschion's work was nothing\r\nbut an abbreviated translation of the works of Soranus. \"Further, it is\r\nheld by Weber and Ermerins that even the original Moschion is not based\r\ndirectly on Soranus, but on a work on diseases of women written in the\r\nfourth century by Cælius Aurelianus, who in his turn drew from\r\nSoranus.... It is interesting to follow the history of this book through\r\nits various stages in the light of these different editions, and we\r\nwould suggest that the first Latin version, for the use of\r\nLatin-speaking matrons and midwives, was produced before the fall of the\r\nWestern Empire in the fifth century; its Greek sister just fits in with\r\nthe development of Eastern or Greek-speaking Empire at Constantinople in\r\nthe sixth century; and the version in barbarous Latin points to a later\r\nperiod, when learning was beginning to make way again in Western\r\nEurope.\"[32] Moschion's book is a catechism consisting of 152 questions\r\nand answers.\r\n\r\n_Paulus Ægineta_ was the last, and one of the most famous, of the Greek\r\nphysicians. He was born probably in the seventh century in the island of\r\nÆgina, but there is some doubt as to the exact period in which he lived.\r\nHe quotes Alexander of Tralles and Ætius, and therefore lived at a later\r\nperiod than they did, either in the sixth or seventh century. The works\r\nof Paulus are compilations, but reveal the skill and learning of the\r\nauthor. He wrote several books, but only one, and that the principal,\r\nremains, and is known by the title of \"De Re Medica Libri Septem.\" Dr.\r\nAdams, of Banchory, translated this book for the Sydenham Society, and\r\nthe introduction shows the scope of the work: \"In the first book you\r\nwill find everything that relates to hygiene, and to the preservation\r\nfrom, and correction of, distempers peculiar to the various ages,\r\nreasons, temperaments, and so forth; also the powers and use of the\r\ndifferent articles of food, as is set forth in the chapter of contents.\r\nIn the second is explained the whole doctrine of fevers, an account of\r\ncertain matters relating to them being premised, such as excrementitious\r\ndischarges, critical days, and other appearances, and concluding with\r\ncertain symptoms which are the concomitants of fevers. The third book\r\nrelates to topical affections, beginning from the crown of the head and\r\ndescending down to the nails of the feet, and so on. Briefly, the fourth\r\nbook treats of external diseases; the fifth, of wounds and bites from\r\nvenomous animals; the sixth book is the most important and is devoted to\r\nsurgery, and contains original observations, and the seventh book\r\ncontains an account of the properties of medicines.\" Paulus wrote a\r\nfamous book on obstetrics, which is now lost, but it gained for him\r\namong the Arabs the title of \"the accoucheur.\"\r\n\r\nThe sixth book on surgery, as has justly been observed by Adams,\r\n\"contains the most complete system of operative surgery which has come\r\ndown to us from ancient times.\" Many important surgical principles are\r\nenunciated, such, for instance, as local depletion as against general,\r\nand the merit of a free external incision. He first described varicose\r\naneurism, and performed the operation of bronchotomy as described by\r\nAntyllus. He favoured the lateral operation for removal of stone from\r\nthe bladder, and amputated the cancerous breast by crucial incision. He\r\nalso had an operation, like that of Antyllus, for the cure of aneurism.\r\nIn brief, Paulus performed many of the operations that are practised at\r\nthe present day. He travelled in the practice of his calling, and not\r\nonly had great fame in the Byzantine Empire and in Arabia in his\r\nlifetime, but exercised great influence for some centuries. His writings\r\ninspired Albucassis, one of the few surgeons and teachers of the Middle\r\nAges.\r\n\r\nAfter the time of Paulus Ægineta the practice of medicine and surgery\r\nsuffered a very rapid decline, and for five centuries no progress was\r\nmade. The Middle Ages form a dark and melancholy period in the history\r\nof medicine, and we have to come to comparatively recent times before we\r\nfind the skill and knowledge of the Ancients equalled, while it is only\r\nat the present day that they are rapidly being excelled.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] \"De re Med.,\" vi, 33.\r\n\r\n[28] C. 28, p. 260, ed.

They conceived that the Almighty had to be\r\npropitiated by signs and symbols. Words, they considered, were the\r\ndirect gift of God to man, and, therefore, signs representing words were\r\nof great avail. Hence arose the use of amulets and cabalistic signs, or,\r\nrather, the common use, for they had been in evidence long prior to the\r\nfoundation of this sect. Amulets were worn on the person. The Jews had\r\nphylacteries or bits of parchment on which were written passages from\r\nthe Scriptures. In the first century after Christ, Jews, Pythagoreans,\r\nEssenes, and various sects of mystics combined and formed the\r\n_Cabalists_ and _Gnostics_. Their creed embraced the magic of the\r\nPersians, the dreams of the Asclepiads, the numbers of Pythagoras, and\r\nthe theory of atoms of Democritus. The Sophists of Alexandria actually\r\nregarded magic as a science. A section of the early Christians were\r\nGnostics, and were imbued with the philosophy of the Orientals.\r\nAccording to the beliefs of the Cabalists and Gnostics, demons were the\r\ncause of disease. These sects interrogated evil spirits to find out\r\nwhere they lurked, and exorcised them with the help of charms and\r\ntalismans. Various geometric figures and devices were held to have power\r\nagainst evil spirits. One of these figures was the device of two\r\ntriangles interlaced thus [Symbol: David's Star]. This was used\r\nas a symbol of God, not only by Cabalists and Gnostics, but also\r\nby Jews. The great majority of the early Christians opposed the\r\nGnostics, and repudiated and abhorred their strange mixture of\r\nthe Christian religion with Eastern philosophy.\r\n\r\nChrist came into the world at a time when the evils of _slavery_ were\r\nprobably at their worst. He did not directly condemn slavery, and the\r\nreason of this is to be found in the study of the nature of His mission.\r\nHe came to regenerate the individual, and not, primarily, society. \"His\r\nlanguage in innumerable similes showed that He believed that those\r\nprinciples He taught would only be successful after long periods of time\r\nand gradual development. Most of His figures and analogies in regard to\r\n'the Kingdom of God' rest upon the idea of slow and progressive growth\r\nor change. He undoubtedly saw that the only true renovation of the world\r\nwould come, not through reforms of institutions or governments, but\r\nthrough individual change of character, effected by the same power to\r\nwhich Plato appealed--the love-power--but a love exercised towards\r\nHimself as a perfect and Divine model. It was the 'Kingdom of God' in\r\nthe soul which should bring on the kingdom of God in human society....\r\nAnd yet ultimately this Christian system will be found at the basis of\r\nall these great movements of progress in human history. But it began by\r\naiming at the individual, and not at society; and aiming alone at an\r\nentire change of the affectional and moral tendencies.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThe moral teaching of the _Stoics_, second only to that of the Christian\r\nreligion, had an effect in preparing the way for the introduction of\r\nhumane principles of treatment for the bond and the oppressed. But the\r\nStoics, like many of the Christians, did not always make their actions\r\naccord with their principles. Seneca tells of a Stoic who amused himself\r\nby feeding his fish with pieces of his mutilated slaves. Juvenal, who\r\nwrote when Stoicism was at the height of its influence, asks \"how a\r\nslave could be a man,\" and Gaius, the Stoical jurist, in the reign of\r\nMarcus Aurelius, classes slaves with animals.\r\n\r\nConstantine, in his own character, did not display the beauties of the\r\nChristian religion, though his advisers who framed his laws acted under\r\nthe influence of Christian teaching. This emperor passed laws in\r\nreference to slavery. He wrote to an archbishop: \"It has pleased me for\r\na long time to establish that, in the Christian Church, masters can give\r\nliberty to their slaves, provided they do it in presence of all the\r\nassembled people with the assistance of Christian priests, and provided\r\nthat, in order to preserve the memory of the fact, some written document\r\ninforms where they sign as parties or as witnesses.\" In pagan times\r\nthere was a somewhat similar system of a master being able to redeem a\r\nslave and register the redemption in one of the temples.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Justinian, influenced largely by the teaching of\r\nChristianity, did a great deal to relieve the burdens of slavery. \"We do\r\nnot transfer persons from a free condition into a servile--we have so\r\nmuch at heart to raise slaves to liberty.\" In the words of one of the\r\nEarly Fathers of the Church, \"No Christian is a slave; those born again\r\nare all brothers.\"\r\n\r\n_Gladiatorial Games_ were condemned by the Stoics, but these\r\nphilosophers did not influence the common people. Constantine, in the\r\nyear before his acceptance of Christianity, gave a multitude of\r\nprisoners as prey to the wild beasts of the arena. In A.D. 325 he\r\npromulgated this law: \"Bloody spectacles, in our present state of\r\ntranquillity and domestic peace, do not please us; wherefore we order\r\nthat all gladiators be prohibited from carrying on their profession.\"\r\nHuman sacrifices, which at one time took place in Rome, even in the time\r\nof Pliny and Seneca, were abolished under the same influence as checked\r\ngladiatorial sports.\r\n\r\nConstantine passed laws against the licentious plays and spectacles\r\nwhich flourished in Greece and Rome in pagan times.\r\n\r\nSeneca wrote: \"Monstrous offspring we destroy; children too, if weak and\r\nunnaturally formed from birth, we drown. It is not anger, but reason,\r\nthus to separate the useless from the sound.\"[34] Julius Paulus, a\r\nStoic, in the time of the Emperor Severus (A.D. 222), held that the\r\nmother who procured abortion, starved her child, or exposed it to die,\r\nwas, in each case, equally guilty of murder. The Christian Fathers, in\r\nopposing these evils, were acting in accordance with the teaching of\r\ntheir founder, and they incessantly condemned these evil practices, and\r\nwith greater and more far-reaching power than the Stoics. Although the\r\nStoics anticipated many of the reforms of the Christians, Stoicism\r\nnever had any penetrating effect on the masses of the people, and\r\ndiffered in this respect from Christianity. The chief obstacle to the\r\nprevention of the exposure of children was the great amount of pauperism\r\nwhich prevailed in the Roman Empire, and Christian emperors and councils\r\nhad no choice but to allow many of these unfortunate children to be\r\ntaken as slaves, rather than that they should perish from cold and\r\nhunger, or be torn by ravenous beasts. The pagan emperors, it is true,\r\nhad done something to found orphanages, but these institutions were not\r\ncommon until the Middle Ages. Trajan in A.D. 100 supported 5,000\r\nchildren at the expense of the State, and endowments were created by him\r\nfor this purpose. Hadrian, Antoninus, and Marcus Aurelius made similar\r\nbenefactions, and Pliny endowed a charity for poor children.\r\n\r\nIn the pre-Christian period, social clubs existed for the purpose of\r\npeople having meals together, helping one another, and providing burial\r\nfunds. The Emperor Julian condemned the Christians for supporting not\r\nonly their own poor, but also poor strangers outside their faith. For\r\nages the Church took charge of the poor. Her enemies said that as much\r\npauperism was created as was relieved, and, no doubt, as is usual in the\r\ndistribution of charity, the good done was not unmixed with evil.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPITALS.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the important question of the foundation of hospitals,\r\nthere are two opposing opinions--one, attributing their foundation\r\nalmost entirely to Christianity,[35] and the other denying to\r\nChristianity any pre-eminent influence.[36] The truth lies between these\r\ntwo conflicting views, but nearer to the statement of Mr. Brace than of\r\nMr. McCabe. The truths and influences of Christianity, in the mind of\r\nthe latter author, are obscured by the many errors of the Church,\r\nespecially in the Early and Middle Ages; and it is of the utmost\r\nimportance to distinguish, where necessary, between the teaching of the\r\nFounder of Christianity as disclosed in the New Testament, and the\r\nteaching of the Church which made many very evident errors, and whose\r\npractice soon became different from that inculcated by its Founder, so\r\nthat at times the Christianity of the Church was as different from\r\nChrist's teaching as the vine of Sodom from the grapes of Eshcol. The\r\nfact that Christianity emerged from this eclipse points to it as\r\nsomething more than a humanly devised system.\r\n\r\nIn very early times, the sick were allowed to remain at the temples for\r\nthe treatment of their diseases, and medical students also attended for\r\ninstruction. This system was the hospital system of later times,\r\nalthough the temples were not hospitals in the present sense of the\r\nword. The system in vogue in the temples of Æsculapius in Greece and\r\nRome has already been described in this book, but the temples of Saturn\r\nserved the same purpose in Egypt four thousand years before Christ.\r\nProfessor Ebers of Leipzig, a high authority on the subject, says that\r\nHeliopolis undoubtedly had a clinique in connection with the temple. The\r\nEmperor Asoka founded many hospitals in Hindustan, and Buddhists and\r\nMohammedans both possessed hospitals (\"Encyclopædia Britannica\").\r\n\r\nPatients were attracted to temples, not only by receiving the services\r\nof the priest-physicians, but also in the superstitious belief that\r\nspecial virtue attached to the precincts of sacred buildings. Thus, in\r\nthe temples of Æsculapius, sick people tried to get as near to the altar\r\nas possible. \"It may fairly be surmised that the disuse of these temples\r\nin Christian times made the necessity of hospitals more apparent, and so\r\nled to their institution, in much the same way as in this country the\r\nsuppression of monasteries, which had largely relieved the indigent\r\npoor, made the necessity of poor laws immediately evident.\"[37] During\r\nHadrian's reign the first notice of a military hospital appears.\r\n\r\nThe _iatria_, or _tabernæ medicæ_, described by Galen and others, were\r\nnot for in-patients, but of the nature of dispensaries for the reception\r\nof out-patients. Seneca refers to valetudinaria, rooms set aside for the\r\nsick in large private houses. The first hospital in Rome in Christian\r\ntimes was founded by Fabiola, a wealthy lady, at the end of the fourth\r\ncentury. Attached to it was a convalescent home in the country.\r\nPulcheria, later, built and endowed several hospitals at Constantinople,\r\nand these subsequently increased in number. Pauline abandoned wealth and\r\nsocial position and went to Jerusalem, and there established a hospital\r\nand sisterhood under the direction of St. Jerome. St. Augustine founded\r\na hospital at Hippo. McCabe states justly: \"In the new religious order a\r\nphilanthropic heroism was evolved that was certainly new to Europe. In\r\nthe whole story of Stoicism there is no figure like that of a Catherine\r\nof Sienna sucking the sores of a leper, or a Vincent de Paul.\" It\r\nappears evident that Christianity was an important factor in the\r\nfoundation of hospitals and charitable institutions, not directly, but\r\nfrom its beneficent influence on the character of individuals; and the\r\nRoman Church, in this respect, acted in conformity with the teachings of\r\nthe Christian faith.\r\n\r\nOf greater importance is the consideration of the influence of\r\nChristianity, and of the Church, on the investigation and elimination of\r\ndisease. In this matter the Church deserves the severest censure. It is\r\nno exaggeration to say that she hindered the scientific progress of the\r\nworld for centuries. She applied to the explanation of the causation of\r\ndisease, the _demon theories_ inherited from Egypt, Persia, and the\r\nEast. The Bible itself reflects the views on demonology current at the\r\ntime of the events recorded. If demons were the cause of disease,\r\nlogically the treatment of diseases should have been in the hands of\r\npriests, not of physicians. The priests held that they were the proper\r\npeople to interpret the will of the Almighty; diseases were direct\r\ndispensations of Providence.\r\n\r\n\"It is demons,\" says Origen, \"which produce famine, unfruitfulness,\r\ncorruptions of the air, and pestilence. They hover concealed in clouds,\r\nin the lower atmosphere, and are attracted by the blood and incense\r\nwhich the heathen offer to them as gods.\"[38] \"All diseases of\r\nChristians,\" wrote Augustine, \"are to be ascribed to these demons:\r\nchiefly do they torment fresh-baptized Christians, yea! even the\r\nguiltless new-born infants.\" Hippocrates, long before the Christian era,\r\nwrote with great wisdom in reference to the so-called sacred diseases:\r\n\"To me it appears that such affections are just as much divine as all\r\nothers are, and that no one disease is either more divine or more human\r\nthan another; but all are alike divine, for each has its own nature, and\r\nno one arises without a natural cause.\"[39]\r\n\r\nThe devil might be driven out in disgust, it was thought, by the use of\r\ndisgusting materials--ordure, the grease made from executed criminals,\r\nthe livers of toads, the blood of rats, and so on. The same belief in\r\ndemoniacal possession led to the most inhuman treatment of lunatics, and\r\nthe Church in this respect is put to shame when we compare its action\r\nwith the wiser and more humane practice of the Moors. This belief helped\r\nto strangle medical progress for centuries, and is directly attributable\r\nto the Church. As late as 1583, the Jesuit fathers at Vienna boasted\r\nthat they had cast out 12,642 devils. That God dispenses both health and\r\ndisease is a very different belief from that involved in \"demoniacal\r\npossession.\" Travellers in remote parts of the East at the present day\r\ntell of alleged cases of demoniacal possession, but investigation does\r\nnot reveal any difference between these cases and epilepsy or acute\r\nmania.\r\n\r\nIn the first centuries of the Christian era men demanded overt signs of\r\nthe favour of God, and the objects of veneration kept in the churches\r\nand monasteries were held to be capable of curing disease. The Latin\r\nChurch had either a saint or a relic of a saint to cure nearly every\r\nill that flesh is heir to. St. Apollonia was invoked against toothache;\r\nSt. Avertin against lunacy; St. Benedict against stone; St. Clara\r\nagainst sore eyes; St. Herbert in hydrophobia; St. John in epilepsy; St.\r\nMaur in gout; St. Pernel in ague; St. Genevieve in fever; St. Sebastian\r\nin plague; St. Ottila for diseases of the head; St. Blazius for the\r\nneck; St. Laurence and St. Erasmus for the body; St. Rochus and St. John\r\nfor diseases of the legs and feet. St. Margaret was invoked for diseases\r\nof children and the dangers of childbirth.\r\n\r\nWhat the influence of Christ's life on earth on the medical art of His\r\ntime was is a difficult question. It must be remembered that He came to\r\nsave the souls and not the bodies of men, not to rapidly alter social\r\nconditions nor to teach science. The eternal life of man was _the_\r\nsubject of transcendent importance, and it is no doubt true that many of\r\nthe early Christians neglected their bodies for the cure of their souls.\r\nAs against this, the gospel of love taught that all men are brothers,\r\nboth bond and free, and this led to mutual help in physical suffering,\r\nand to the foundation of charitable institutions. In the times of\r\npersecution of the Christians many of them welcomed suffering and death\r\nas the portal to eternal bliss.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that the _miraculous cures_ wrought by Christ for\r\nHis own purposes were an intimation to His followers to neglect the\r\nordinary means of natural cure, and that this placed a Christian doctor\r\nin the position of having to abandon his calling. This is not so. To St.\r\nLuke--a Christian physician and the writer of the third Gospel and the\r\nActs of the Apostles--the performance by Christ of miracles of healing\r\npresented no difficulties, for he was the travelling medical adviser of\r\nSt. Paul, and accompanied him on three journeys, from Troas to Philippi,\r\nfrom Philippi to Jerusalem, and from Cæsarea to Rome (A.D. 62). St. Paul\r\nwrote: \"For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble\r\nwhich came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above\r\nstrength, insomuch that we despaired even of life, but we had the\r\nsentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves,\r\nbut in God, which raiseth the dead: who delivered us from so great a\r\ndeath, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that He will yet deliver us.\"\r\nSt. Paul exercised faith, but also used the means of cure prescribed by\r\n\"the beloved physician.\" In a very scholarly book published by the\r\nDublin University Press in 1882, the Rev. W. K. Hobart, LL.D., shows\r\nthat St. Luke was acquainted with the technical medical terms of the\r\nGreek medical writers. St. Luke was an Asiatic Greek. Dr. Hobart writes:\r\n\"Finally, it should not be left out of account that, in any illness from\r\nwhich he might be suffering, there was no one to whom St. Paul would be\r\nlikely to apply with such confidence as to St. Luke, for it is probable\r\nthat, in the whole extent of the Roman Empire, the only Christian\r\nphysician at this time was St. Luke.\" In later years the pretence of\r\nperforming miracles to cure diseases had a great effect in advancing\r\nsuperstition and retarding scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nTacitus and Suetonius record miracles alleged to have been performed by\r\nVespasian. He is said to have anointed the eyes of a blind man at\r\nAlexandria with the royal spittle, and to have restored his sight.\r\nAnother case was that of a man who had lost the use of his hands, and\r\nVespasian touched them with his foot and thus restored their function.\r\nIt is interesting to follow the career of Proclus, the last rector of\r\nthe Neoplatonic School, \"whose life,\" says Gibbon, \"with that of his\r\nscholar Isidore, composed by two of their most learned disciples,\r\nexhibits a most deplorable picture of the second childhood of human\r\nreason.\" By long fasting and prayer Proclus pretended to possess the\r\nsupernatural power of expelling all diseases.\r\n\r\nThe priests of the Church denounced the practice of _Anatomy_, and so\r\nchanged the progress made by the Alexandrian School, and by men like\r\nGalen, into the ignorance of a thousand years. The body was the temple\r\nof the Holy Ghost, and should not therefore be desecrated by\r\ndissection. \"Strangers' rests\" and hospitals were connected with the\r\nmonasteries, and were exceedingly useful, notably in the time of the\r\nCrusades, but these Church institutions were in a very insanitary\r\ncondition, for the maxim that cleanliness is next to godliness had\r\nlittle application among the religious orders of the Middle Ages. Dr.\r\nWalsh attempts to show that the Reformers blackened the fair fame of the\r\nChurch they had left, and states that it is to \"this unfortunate state\r\nof affairs, and not real opposition on the part of the Popes to\r\nscience,\" that we owe the belief in \"the supposed opposition between the\r\nChurch and Science.\"[40] That the Popes did something to foster medical\r\nscience in a spasmodic kind of way, that papal physicians were appointed\r\nand that the Church exercised control over some seats of learning may be\r\nfreely admitted. That the monasteries preserved some of the Latin\r\nclassics that they were not all corrupt, and that all monks were not\r\nignorant and idle, are facts beyond dispute. No doubt, too, the enemies\r\nof Christianity have overstated their case, but when all is said, the\r\nfact remains that the Church enjoyed great opportunities for promoting\r\nknowledge and investigating disease, and failed to avail itself of them\r\nto such an extent that for ages no real progress was made. This is\r\ncertainly not an extreme opinion. It would be nearer the truth to say\r\nthat not only was no progress made, but that the advances made by\r\nHippocrates, by the school of Alexandria, by Celsus, and by Galen, were\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in spite of the dreadful blunders and perversions of the\r\nChurch in the Early and Middle Ages, and the partial eclipse which\r\nChristianity suffered, the teaching of its Founder slowly but surely\r\nended the harsh and cruel ways of the pagans, and was the prime factor\r\nin promoting the altruism of later times, of which medical knowledge and\r\nmedical service form a very important part.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] \"Gesta Christi; or a History of Human Progress under Christianity,\"\r\nby C.

The Greeks fully\r\nrecognized that mental culture could not reach its highest perfection if\r\nthe development of the body were neglected. Lucian attributes not only\r\nthe bodily grace of the Ancient Greeks, but also their mental\r\npre-eminence, to the gymnastic exercises which they practised. They were\r\nalso an important factor in the excellence of Greek sculpture, and\r\nprobably the most important part of their medical treatment.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the baths of the Romans and the gymnasia of the Greeks\r\nbecame in time the haunts of the lazy and voluptuous. The gymnastic\r\nexercises of the Greeks date from very early times, and at first were\r\nof a warlike nature, and not reduced to a system. Each town possessed a\r\ngymnasium, and three very important ones were situated at Athens.\r\n\r\nVitruvius describes the general plan of an ancient gymnasium. It\r\ncomprised a great stadium capable of accommodating a vast concourse of\r\nspectators, many porticoes where athletes exercised and philosophers and\r\nsages held discussions and lectured, walks and shady groves, and baths\r\nand anointing rooms. The buildings, in true Grecian fashion, were made\r\nvery beautiful, being adorned with statues and works of art, and\r\nsituated in pleasant surroundings.\r\n\r\nUp to the age of 16 boys were instructed in gymnastics, in music and in\r\ngrammar, and from 16 to 18 in gymnastics alone. The laws of Solon\r\nregulated the use of the gymnasia, and for very many years these laws\r\nwere strictly enforced. It appears that married women did not attend the\r\ngymnasia, and unmarried women only in some parts of Greece, such as\r\nSparta, but this custom was relaxed in later years.\r\n\r\nThe office of Gymnasiarch (Superintendent of Gymnasia) was one of great\r\nhonour, but involved also a great deal of expense to the holder of the\r\noffice. He wore a purple cloak and white shoes. Officers were appointed\r\nto supervise the morals and conduct of the boys and youths, and the\r\nGymnasiarch had power to expel people whose teaching or example might\r\nbe injurious to the young.\r\n\r\nGalen relates that the chief teachers of the gymnasia were capable of\r\nprescribing suitable exercises, and thus had powers of medical\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nBefore exercises were commenced, the body was anointed, and fine sand or\r\ndust applied. Regulation of the diet was considered of very great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe games of the gymnasia were many and various, including games of\r\nball, tug-of-war, top-spinning, and a game in which five stones were\r\nplaced on the back of the hand, thrown upwards, and caught in the palm.\r\nOne kind of game or exercise consisted in throwing a rope over a high\r\npost, when two boys took the ends of the rope, one boy on each side, the\r\none trying to pull the other up. The most important exercises, however,\r\nwere running, walking, throwing the discus, jumping, wrestling, boxing,\r\nand dancing.\r\n\r\nThe first public gymnasium in Rome was built by the Emperor Nero. In the\r\ntime of the Republic Greek exercises were held in contempt by the\r\nRomans, and the first gymnasia in Rome were small, and connected only\r\nwith private houses or villas.\r\n\r\nThe gymnasia were dedicated to Apollo, the god of healing, and exercises\r\nwere considered of greater importance for restoring health than\r\nmedicinal treatment. The directors of the gymnasia were in reality\r\nphysicians, and acted as such. Plato states that one of these, Iccus by\r\nname, was the inventor of medical gymnastics. As in our own day, many\r\ncreditable gymnasts, originally weak of body, had perfected their\r\nstrength by systematic exercise and careful dieting.\r\n\r\nHippocrates had occasion to protest against prolonged and laborious\r\nexercises, and excessive massage, and recommended his own system, that\r\nof moderation. He applied massage to reduce swellings in suitable cases,\r\nand also recognized that the same treatment was capable of increasing\r\nnutrition, and of producing increased growth and development.\r\nHippocrates described exercises of the kind now known as Swedish,\r\nconsisting of free movements without resistance.\r\n\r\nGalen generally followed the teaching of Hippocrates on gymnastics, and\r\nwrote a whole book on the merits of using the strigil. Oribasius, and\r\nAntyllus, too, in their writings, recommend special exercises which\r\nappealed to their judgment.\r\n\r\nThe ancient physicians had great faith in the efficacy of exercises in\r\ncases of dropsy, and Asclepiades employed this method of treatment very\r\nextensively, using also pleasant medicaments, so that Pliny said \"this\r\nphysician made himself the delight of mankind.\" Patients suffering from\r\nconsumption were commonly sent to Alexandria to benefit from the\r\nclimate, but Celsus considered the sea voyage most beneficial because\r\nthe patient was exercised bodily by the motion of the ship. Germanicus\r\nwas cured by riding exercise, and Cicero was strengthened by travelling\r\nand massage.\r\n\r\nFrom the writings of Greek and Roman physicians there is no other\r\nconclusion to be drawn but that exercises and gymnastics were in great\r\nvogue for medical purposes, and were of the utmost benefit. It seems\r\nlikely that the exercises of the Greeks, and the baths of the Romans,\r\nboth freed from the abuses which took away in time from their merits,\r\ncould be adopted at the present day and encouraged by physicians with\r\ngreat advantage to their patients. There is a strong tendency at present\r\nin that direction.\r\n\r\nBelonging to a different class were the contests of the athletes, who,\r\nexcept in very early times in Greece, were people of the baser sort\r\nwhose bodies were developed to the neglect of their minds. Those who\r\nunderwent the severest training ate enormous quantities of meat, and\r\ntried to cultivate bulk and weight rather than strength. They did not\r\ncompete, as a rule, after the age of thirty-five years. Euripides\r\nconsidered these athletes an encumbrance on the State. Plato said they\r\nwere very subject to disease, without grace of manner, violent, and\r\nbrutal. Aristotle declared that the athletes had not the active vigour\r\nthat good citizens ought to possess.\r\n\r\nThe athletes and gladiators of Rome were mostly Greeks. Both Plutarch\r\nand Galen deride them. The former condemned the whole business, and\r\nGalen wrote six chapters to warn young men against becoming athletes. He\r\nsaid that man is linked to the divine and also to the lower animals,\r\nthat the link with animals was developed by athletics, and that athletes\r\nwere immoderate in eating, sleeping, and exertion, and were therefore\r\nunhealthy, and more liable than other people to disease and sudden\r\ndeath. Their brutal strength was of use only on rare occasions and\r\nunsuited for war, or for useful work.\r\n\r\nIn the time of St. Paul, the athletes were evidently abstemious, for he\r\nwrote \"every man who striveth in the games is temperate in all things,\"\r\nbut in Rome, at most periods of their history this class of men was\r\nnotorious for grossness and brutality.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATHS (_Balneæ_).\r\n\r\n_Greek Baths._--In Greece from very early times inability to read and to\r\nswim were considered the marks of the ignorant. In Homer's time\r\nover-indulgence in warm baths was considered effeminate.[41] The system\r\nof bathing was never so complete in Greece as in Rome, but in the former\r\ncountry there were both public and private baths, and ancient Greek\r\nvases display pictures of swimming-baths and shower-baths, and also of\r\nlarge basins for men and for women round which they stood to bathe. The\r\nGreek baths were near the gymnasia. After the bath, the bathers were\r\nanointed with oil and took refreshments. Sometimes a material consisting\r\nof a lye made of lime or wood-ashes, of nitrum and of fuller's earth was\r\napplied to the body. Towels and strigils were employed for rubbing and\r\nscraping after the anointing; the strigil was, as a rule, made of iron.\r\n\r\nNatural warm springs used for curative purposes are mentioned by ancient\r\nGreek writers.\r\n\r\n_Roman Baths._--Bathing, which was not much in vogue in Rome in the most\r\nancient times, was more common during the Republic, and became a factor\r\nin the decay of the nation in the time of the Empire. Seneca informs us\r\nthat the ancient Romans washed their arms and legs every day and their\r\nwhole bodies once a week. The bath-room was near the kitchen in the\r\nRoman house, to be convenient for the supply of hot water. Scipio's bath\r\nwas \"small and dark after the manner of the ancients.\" In the time of\r\nCicero, the use of baths, both public and private, was general, and\r\nhot-water and hot-air baths are both mentioned. It has been computed\r\nthat there were 856 baths in Rome in the time of Constantine.\r\n\r\nThe public baths were at first used only by the poor, but the mother of\r\nAugustus went to the public bath, and in time even the emperors\r\npatronized them. The baths were opened at sunrise and closed at sunset\r\nexcept in the time of Alexander Severus, when they were open also at\r\nnight. The charges for admission were very low. The ringing of a bell\r\nannounced that the bath was ready. Baths were taken seven or eight times\r\nin succession when the people were given to luxury, and some of them\r\nwasted almost the whole day there. The voluptuaries of the Empire bathed\r\nnot only before the principal meal of the day, but also afterwards to\r\npromote digestion as they thought. The perspiration induced by the bath\r\ntook the place of honest sweat induced by work or exercise, and\r\nexcessive hot-bathing and perspiring in some cases had a fatal ending.\r\n\r\nGalen and Celsus differ in their directions to bathers. Galen\r\nrecommended first the hot-air bath, next the hot-water bath, then the\r\ncold bath and finally rubbing; Celsus recommended sweating first in the\r\ntepid chamber, then in the hot chamber, and next the pouring of hot,\r\nthen tepid, and lastly, cold water over the head, followed by the use of\r\nthe strigil, and anointing and rubbing.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the baths at Pompeii, which was largely a pleasure resort,\r\nis typical of the public baths that were in general use. These baths had\r\nseveral entrances, and the principal one led to a covered portico from\r\nwhich a lavatory opened. The portico ran round three sides of a\r\ncourtyard (_atrium_) in which the attendants waited, and it was also the\r\nexercise-yard for the young men. Advertisements of the theatres and\r\ngladiatorial shows were exhibited on the walls of the atrium. The\r\nundressing room was also the reception room and meeting-place. The\r\nbathers' garments were handed over for custody to slaves, who were, as a\r\ngeneral rule, a very dishonest class. The _frigidarium_ contained a cold\r\nbath 13 ft. 8 in. in diameter, and a little less than 4 ft. deep. It had\r\ntwo marble steps, and a seat under water 10 in. from the bottom. Water\r\nran into the bath through a bronze spout, and there was a conduit for\r\nthe outflow, and an overflow pipe. The frigidarium opened into the\r\n_tepidarium_ which was heated with hot air from furnaces, and furnished\r\nwith a charcoal brazier and benches. The brazier at Pompeii was 7 ft.\r\nlong and 2-1/2 ft. broad. The tepidarium was commonly a beautifully\r\nornamented apartment, while the anointing-room was conveniently situated\r\noff it. Pliny has described the various unguents used by wealthy and\r\nluxurious Romans. From the tepidarium the bather might enter the\r\n_caldarium_ or sweating room, an apartment constructed with double walls\r\nand floor, between which hot air was made to pass. This room contained a\r\n_labrum_, or circular marble basin, containing cold water for pouring\r\nover the head before the bather left the caldarium. The method of\r\nheating rooms by passing hot air between the \"hanging\" and the lower\r\nfloor was in use in the better class of houses, and the device can at\r\npresent be seen in some of the buildings on the Palatine Hill in Rome,\r\nand in the ruins of the great Baths of Caracalla. After a course of\r\nsweating the bather had the sweat removed from his body by the strigil,\r\nin much the same way as a horse is scraped with a bent piece of\r\nhoop-iron by a groom. The _guttus_ was a small vessel with a narrow neck\r\nadapted for dropping oil on the strigil to lubricate its working edge.\r\nPliny states that invalids used sponges instead of strigils. Rubbing\r\nwith towels followed the use of the strigil, and the bather finally\r\nlounged in the tepidarium for a varying period before entering the outer\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe boilers in use at Pompeii were three in number. The lowest one,\r\nimmediately over the furnace, contained the hottest water. The next\r\nabove and a short distance to the side held tepid water, and the\r\nfarthest removed contained cold water. This system was economical\r\nbecause as the very hot water was drawn off from the lowest boiler a\r\nsupply of tepid water flowed down from the boiler next above, and from\r\nthe highest to the middle boiler.\r\n\r\nA smaller suite of bathing apartments adjoining the men's establishment\r\nwas for the use of women.\r\n\r\nThe most important baths formed only a part of the great establishments\r\ncalled _thermæ_. Adjoining the baths of the thermæ were a gymnasium for\r\nsports and exercises, a library for the studious, lounging places for\r\nthe idle, halls for poets and philosophers, in which they declaimed and\r\nlectured, museums of art, and sometimes shady groves. These complete\r\nestablishments were first erected by Marcus Agrippa in the time of\r\nAugustus. Succeeding emperors vied with each other in providing\r\nmagnificent thermæ, and the ruins of the Baths of Caracalla remain in a\r\nwonderful state of preservation to this day. The building of these baths\r\nbegan in A.D. 216. The structure, 1,050 ft. long and 1,390 ft. broad,\r\nwas on a scale of almost incredible magnificence. Priceless statues and\r\nrare objects of art have been unearthed from the ruins. In recent years\r\nexcavations have revealed a complicated system of subterranean corridors\r\nand galleries which existed for the purpose of carrying leaden\r\nwater-pipes to the baths, and providing a passage-way for the host of\r\nslaves who acted as bath-attendants. The great buildings were well lit\r\nby windows in the walls of the courtyards, and these openings also\r\nallowed for ventilation. A great stadium and beautiful gardens adjoined\r\nthe Baths of Caracalla. In the north-west section of these baths Alessio\r\nValle has very recently discovered the remains of a great public\r\nlibrary. When Caracalla pillaged Alexandria he probably carried off many\r\nof the books from the famous library there to enrich his baths. The\r\nruins of the library in the Baths of Caracalla reveal circular tiers of\r\ngalleries for the display of manuscripts and papyri. There were 500\r\nrooms round these baths. The great hall had a ceiling made in one span,\r\nand the roof was an early example of reinforced concrete, for it was\r\nmade of concrete in which bronze bars were laid. The lead for the\r\nwater-pipes was probably brought from Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe Thermæ of Diocletian could accommodate 3,200 bathers. Its tepidarium\r\nwas 300 ft. long by nearly 100 ft. wide, \"vaulted in three bays with\r\nsimple quadripartite groining, which springs from eight monolithic\r\ncolumns of Egyptian granite about 50 ft. high and 5 ft. in diameter\"\r\n(Middleton).\r\n\r\nFrom the medical point of view, these great bathing institutions were\r\ncapable of being used for the treatment of various diseases, and for\r\nphysical culture. No doubt, they were extensively employed for these\r\npurposes and with good results, but their legitimate use became\r\nincreasingly limited, and abuse of them was a prime factor in promoting\r\nnational decay. To show to what an extent luxurious bathing was carried\r\nin some instances, it is interesting to read that baths were taken\r\nsometimes in warm perfumes, in saffron oil, and that the voluptuous\r\nPoppæa soothed her skin in baths of milk drawn from a herd of 500\r\nshe-asses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] Od. viii, 249.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nSANITATION.\r\n\r\n     Water-supply--Its extent--The Aqueducts--Distribution in\r\n     city--Drainage--Disposal of the Dead--Cremation and\r\n     Burial--Catacombs--Public Health Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER-SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Greece, the cities were supplied with water from springs over\r\nwhich beautiful fountains were erected. The Greek aqueducts were not on\r\nthe same grand scale as the Roman, but were usually rectangular channels\r\ncut in the rock, or made of pipes or masonry. Great care was taken in\r\nthe supervision of these public works.\r\n\r\nThe first Roman aqueduct, according to Frontinus, dates from 312 B.C.\r\n\r\nPliny wrote of the Claudian aqueduct: \"But if anyone will carefully\r\ncalculate the quantity of the public supply of water, for baths,\r\nreservoirs, houses, trenches, gardens and suburban villas, and, along\r\nthe distance which it traverses, the arches built, the mountains\r\nperforated, the valleys levelled, he will confess that there never was\r\nanything more wonderful in the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nFrontinus, who was controller of the aqueducts in the time of Nerva and\r\nof Trajan, describes nine aqueducts, of which four belonged to the days\r\nof the Republic, and five to the reigns of Augustus and Claudius.\r\n\r\n\"The total water-supply of Rome has been estimated at 332,306,624\r\ngallons a day, or, taking the population at a million, 332 gallons a\r\nhead. Forty gallons a day is now considered sufficient.\"[42]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Aqua Virgo at the present day supplies the magnificent\r\nFontana di Trevi, and the glorious fountains in the Piazzo di Spagna and\r\nthe Piazzo Navona.\r\n\r\nThe Romans not only provided great aqueducts for the Imperial City, but\r\nalso built them throughout various parts of the Empire. In Rome, the\r\naqueducts were built to supply both the low and the high levels of the\r\ncity. The reason why the Romans did not build underground aqueducts, as\r\nis done at the present day, has been variously explained. Perhaps they\r\ndid not fully understand that water will find its own level over a great\r\ndistance. They also would have found great difficulty in overcoming the\r\nhigh pressure of the water.\r\n\r\nIn their conduits they built shafts at frequent intervals designed to\r\nrelieve the pressure of compressed air in the pipes. The water from the\r\nneighbourhood of Rome rapidly encrusted channels and pipes with\r\ncalcareous deposits. Probably the great advantage of accessibility to\r\nleaks and defects gained by building unenclosed aqueducts appealed\r\nstrongly to the ancient Romans. They did not fully understand the\r\ntechnical difficulties involved in the \"hydraulic mean gradient.\" No\r\nmachinery was used to pump the water or raise it to an artificial level.\r\nA strip of land 15 ft. wide was left on either side of the aqueducts,\r\nand this land was defined at intervals by boundary stones. No trees were\r\ngrown near the aqueduct, to avoid the risk of injuring the foundations,\r\nand any breach of the rules for the preservation of the aqueducts was\r\nseverely punished by fines.\r\n\r\nVitruvius gives rules for testing the water, and points out that water\r\nled through earthen pipes is more wholesome than water coming from\r\nleaden ones. He states that the \"fall\" of an aqueduct should be not less\r\nthan 1 in 200. A circuit was often made to prevent the too rapid flow of\r\nthe water, and intermediate reservoirs were constructed to avoid a\r\nshortage of water in the case of a broken main. Reservoirs were also\r\nused for irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe water from the aqueduct was received at the walls of the city in a\r\ngreat reservoir called _castellum aquarum_, externally a beautiful\r\nbuilding and internally a vast chamber lined with hard cement and\r\ncovered with a vaulted roof supported on pillars. The water flowed\r\nthence into three smaller reservoirs, the middle one filled by the\r\noverflow of the two outer ones. The outer reservoirs supplied the public\r\nbaths and private houses, while the middle one supplied the public ponds\r\nand fountains, so that, in the event of a shortage of water, the first\r\nsupply to fail was the least important. The amount of water provided for\r\nprivate use could be checked, for purposes of revenue, by means of this\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\nAt first the aqueducts were not connected with private houses, but,\r\nlater, private persons were allowed to buy the water which escaped from\r\nleaks in the aqueducts. Next, private connections were made with the\r\npublic mains, and, finally, reservoirs were built at the expense of\r\nadjoining households, but these reservoirs, although built with private\r\nmoney, were considered part of the public property. Water rights were\r\nrenewed with each change of occupant. The water-supply to a house was\r\nmeasured by the size of the pipe through which it passed at the in-flow\r\nand at the out-flow of the reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe _curatores aquarum_ had very responsible duties. Under their orders,\r\nin the time of Trajan, were 460 slaves who were subdivided into various\r\nclasses, each of which had its own particular duties to perform in\r\nconnection with the maintenance and control of the water-supply. A\r\nsupply of pure water and proper drainage are of first importance in\r\nsanitation, and it is evident that the Romans understood these matters\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nThe drains of Athens, built of brick and stone and provided with\r\nair-shafts, ran into a basin from which pipes carried the sewage beneath\r\nthe surrounding plain which it helped to fertilize.\r\n\r\nThe chief drain of Rome was the Cloaca Maxima, and there was a great\r\nnetwork of smaller drains. The privy in private houses was usually\r\nsituated near the kitchen, and a common drain from the kitchen and the\r\nprivy discharged into the public cloaca. A pipe opened just above the\r\nfloor of the closet to supply water for flushing. Ruins of very small\r\nrooms have been discovered in the Via Sacra of the Roman Forum, and it\r\nhas puzzled archæologists to discover their use, but they are thought to\r\nhave been sanitary closets. The sewers of Rome drained into the Tiber.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSAL OF THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nBoth in Greece and Rome earth-burial and cremation were employed for the\r\ndisposal of the dead. Near the Temple of Faustina in the Roman Forum,\r\nunder the Via Sacra, have been found the graves of some of the dwellers\r\nof the hills before Romulus founded the city. In Rome, burial within the\r\ncity was forbidden from the time of the Twelve Tables. Exceptions were\r\nmade in the case of emperors, vestal virgins, and famous men, such as\r\nthose who had been honoured with triumphs. The large cemetery for the\r\npoor lay on the east side of the city and the tombs of the rich were\r\nalong the roadsides. The remains of some of these can now be seen along\r\nthe Appian Way. One of these tombs is the Tomb of the Scipios, which, as\r\nByron wrote, \"contains no ashes now.\" Near the Tomb of the Scipios can\r\nbe seen a door with high steps which leads to the _columbaria_. These\r\nare little rooms provided with pigeon-holes for the reception of the\r\nashes of the freedmen of notabilities. Inscriptions show that some of\r\nthese freedmen were physicians, and others musicians and silversmiths.\r\nThe shops of the perfumers stood in a part of the Forum on the Via\r\nSacra. Perfumes were much used at incinerations to disguise the smell of\r\ndecomposition before the fires were kindled. The Christians opposed\r\ncremation and favoured earth burial, and in time the business of the\r\nperfume-sellers failed, and Constantine bought their shops.\r\n\r\nThe _Catacombs_ were used almost entirely by the Christians. If all the\r\npassages of the Catacombs could be placed in line, it is said that they\r\nwould extend the whole length of Italy. They were hewn out of volcanic\r\nsoil very well suited for the purpose, and were probably extensions, in\r\nthe first place, of quarries made for the purpose of obtaining building\r\ncement. They were used by the Christians, not only for the religious\r\nrite of burial, but also as secluded meeting places. The bodies were\r\nlaid in _loculi_, sometimes in two or three tiers, the loculi being\r\nfilled in with earth and stone.\r\n\r\nMany of our public health regulations had their counterpart in ancient\r\ntimes, for instance, any factory or workshop in Rome which created a\r\npublic nuisance had to be removed outside the city. The _spoliarium_ of\r\nthe Coliseum was an ancient morgue.\r\n\r\nA detached building or room, _valetudinarium_, was provided in large\r\nhouses for sick slaves. This was for the purpose of preventing infection\r\nas well as for convenient attendance on the sick.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] \"Dict. of Gr. and Rom.

A few were paid very large fees, but the\r\nrank and file did not make more money than was equal to keeping them in\r\ndecency.\r\n\r\nSeleucus paid Erasistratus about £20,000 for curing his son Antiochus.\r\nHerodotus mentions that the Æginetans (532 B.C.) paid Democedes, from\r\nthe public treasury, £304 a year; the Athenians afterwards paid him £406\r\na year, and at Samos he received £422 yearly. Pliny says that Albutius,\r\nArruntius, Calpetanus, Cassius and Rubrius each made close upon £2,000 a\r\nyear, and that Quintus Stertinius favoured the Emperor by accepting\r\nabout £4,000 a year when he could have made more in private practice.\r\nThe surgeon Alcon made a fortune of nearly £100,000 by a few years'\r\npractice in Gaul. Pliny states that Manlius Cornutus paid his doctor\r\n£2,000 for curing him of a skin disease, and Galen's fee for curing the\r\nwife of a consul was about £400 of our money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcademics, 56\r\n\r\nAdamantius, 116\r\n\r\nAdams of Banchory, 31, 32, 124\r\n\r\nÆsculapius, 3, 13, 14\r\n ----, College of, 6\r\n ----, temple of, 4, 14,
