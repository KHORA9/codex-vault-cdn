Applying\r\nthis rule to the case of 20 cubic meters under a hydrostatic pressure\r\nof 30 millimeters, we find:\r\n\r\n           20 × 30 = 600 kilogrammeters.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a pressure of 80 millimeters, we have:\r\n\r\n           20 × 80 = 1,600 kilogrammeters.\r\n\r\nIf we admit a product of 50 per cent., we shall have in the two cases,\r\nfor the power actually necessary:\r\n\r\n           600\r\n          ---- = 1,200 kilogrammeters, or 16 H.P.\r\n          0.05\r\n\r\n         1,600\r\n         ----- = 3,200 kilogrammeters, or 43 H.P.\r\n          0.05\r\n\r\nSuch are the limits within which the power of the motor should be able\r\nto vary.\r\n\r\nAfter successively examining all the different systems of engines now\r\nin existence, and finding none which, in a plain form, was capable of\r\nfulfilling the conditions imposed, Mr. E.D. Farcot decided to study\r\nout one for himself. Almost from the very beginning of his researches\r\nin this direction, he adopted the Woolf system, which is one that\r\npermits of great variation in the expansion, and one in which the\r\nsteam under full pressure acts only upon the small piston. There are\r\nmany types of this engine in use, all of which present marked defects.\r\nIn one of them, the large cylinder is arranged directly over the small\r\none so as to have but a single rod for the two pistons; and the two\r\ncylinders have then one bottom in common, which is furnished with a\r\nstuffing-box in which the rod moves. With this arrangement we have but\r\na single connecting rod and a single crank for the shaft; but, the\r\nstuffing-box not being accessible so that it can be kept in a clean\r\nstate, there occur after a time both leakages of steam and entrances\r\nof air.\r\n\r\nMr. Farcot has further simplified this last named type by suppressing\r\nthe intermediate partition, and consequently the stuffing-box. The\r\nengine thus becomes direct acting, that is to say, the steam acts\r\nfirst upon the lower surface of the small piston during its ascent,\r\nand afterward expands in the large cylinder and exerts its pressure\r\nupon the upper surface of the large piston during its descent.\r\nMoreover, the expansion may be begun in the small cylinder, thanks to\r\nthe use of a slide plate distributing valve, devised by the elder\r\nFarcot and slightly modified by the son.\r\n\r\nAs the volume comprised between the two pistons varies with the\r\nposition of the latter, annoying counter-pressures might result\r\ntherefrom had not care been taken to put the chamber in communication\r\nwith a reservoir of ten times greater capacity, and which is formed by\r\nthe interior of the frame. This brings about an almost constant\r\ncounter-pressure.\r\n\r\nThe type of motor under consideration, which we represent in the\r\naccompanying plate, is possessed of remarkable simplicity. The number\r\nof parts is reduced to the extremest limits; it works at high speed\r\nwithout perceptible wear; it does not require those frequent repairs\r\nthat many other cheap engines do; and the expansion of the steam is\r\nutilized without occasioning violent shocks in the parts which\r\ntransmit motion. Finally, the plainness of the whole apparatus is\r\nperfectly in accordance with the uses for which it was devised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARCOT'S IMPROVED WOOLF COMPOUND ENGINE.]\r\n\r\n_Details of Construction._--Figs. 1 and 2 represent the motor in\r\nvertical section made in the direction of two planes at right angles.\r\nFigs. 3 and 4 are horizontal sections made respectively in the\r\ndirection of the lines 1-2 and 3-4.\r\n\r\nThe frame, which is of cast iron and entirely hollow, consists of two\r\nuprights, B, connected at their upper part by a sort of cap, B¹, which\r\nis cast in a piece with the two cylinders, C and _c_. The whole rests\r\nupon a base, B², which is itself bolted to the masonry foundation.\r\n\r\nEach of the uprights is provided internally with projecting pieces for\r\nreceiving the guides between which slides the cross-head, _g_, of the\r\npiston rod. The slides terminate in two lubricating cups designed for\r\noiling the surfaces submitted to friction.\r\n\r\nThe cross-head carries two bearings, _g¹_, to which is jointed the\r\nforked extremity, D, of the connecting rod, whose opposite extremity\r\nreceives a strap that embraces the cranked end of the driving shaft,\r\nA. It will be remarked that the crank, A¹, and the bearings, _g¹_,\r\nare very long. The end the inventor had in view in constructing them\r\nthus was to diminish friction.\r\n\r\nTo the shaft, A, are keyed the coupling disks, Q, which are cast solid\r\nat a portion of their circumference situated at 180° with respect to\r\nthe parts, A², of the cranked shaft, the object of this being to\r\nbalance the latter as well as a portion of the connecting rod, D.\r\n\r\nThe shaft, A, also receives the eccentric, E, of the slide valve, the\r\nrod, _e_, of which is jointed to the slide valve rod through the\r\nintermedium of a cross-head, _e¹_, analogous to that of the pistons,\r\nand which, like the latter, runs on guides held by the support, b.\r\n\r\nThe two pistons, _p_ and P, are mounted very simply on the rod, T, as\r\nshown in Fig. 1, and slide in cylinders, _c_ and C, whose diameters\r\nare respectively equal to 270 and 470 millimeters.\r\n\r\nThe slide valve box, F, is bolted to the cap-piece, B¹, as seen in\r\nFig. 4. As for the slide valve, _t_, its arrangement may be\r\ndistinguished in section in Fig. 2. Its eccentric is keyed at 170° so\r\nas to admit steam into the small cylinder during the entire travel,\r\nwhich latter is 470 mm.\r\n\r\nTo permit of the expansion beginning in the small cylinder, Mr. Farcot\r\nhas added a sliding plate, _t¹_, which abuts at every stroke against\r\nthe stops, _s_. These latter are affixed to the rod, S, whose lower\r\nextremity is threaded, and which may be moved vertically, as slightly\r\nas may be desired, through the medium of the pinions, S¹, when the\r\nhand-wheel, V, is revolved. A datum point, _v_, and a graduated\r\nsocket, _v¹_, allow the position of the stops, _s_, and consequently\r\nthe degree of expansion, to be known.\r\n\r\nSteam is introduced into the small cylinder through the conduit, _i_,\r\nand its passage into the large one is effected through the conduit,\r\n_f_. The escape into the interior of the frame is effected, after\r\nexpansion, through the horizontal conduit, _h_. The pipe, H, leads\r\nthis exhaust steam to the open air.\r\n\r\nThe pipe, I, leads steam into the jacket, C¹, of the large cylinder,\r\nthis latter being provided in addition with a casing of wood, C², so\r\nas to completely prevent chilling.\r\n\r\nThe regulator, R, is after the Büss pattern, and is set in motion by a\r\nbelt which runs over the pulleys, _a_ and _a¹_. It is mounted upon a\r\ndistributing box, R¹, to which steam is led from the boiler by the\r\npipe, _r¹_. After traversing this box, the steam enters the slide\r\nvalve box through the pipe, _r²_, its admission thereto being\r\nregulated by the hand-wheel, R², which likewise serves for stopping\r\nthe engine.\r\n\r\nThe cocks, _x_, are fixed at the base of the uprights, B, for drawing\r\nfrom the frame the condensed water that has accumulated therein.\r\n\r\nThe lubricating apparatus, V, which communicates, through the tube,\r\n_u_, with the steam port, _r¹_, permits oil to be sent to the large\r\nand small cylinders through the tubes, _u¹_ and _u²_.\r\n\r\nMr. Farcot has recently adapted this type of motor to the direct\r\nrunning of electric machines that are required to make 400 revolutions\r\nper minute.--_Publication Industrielle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON AND STEEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the recent meeting of the Iron and Steel Institute, London, the\r\npresident-elect (Mr. Bernard Samuelson, M.P.), delivered the following\r\ninaugural address:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD'S PRODUCTION OF PIG IRON.\r\n\r\nHe showed that the world's production of pig iron has increased in\r\nround numbers from 10,500,000 tons in 1869 to 20,500,000 tons in 1882.\r\nThe blast furnaces of 1869 produced on the average a little over 180\r\ntons per week, with a temperature of blast scarcely exceeding 800°\r\nFahr. The consumption of coke per ton of iron varied from 25 to 30\r\ncwt. To-day our blast furnaces produce on the average upward of 300\r\ntons per week.\r\n\r\nThe Consett Company have reached a production of 3,400 tons in four\r\nweeks, or 850 tons per week, and of 134 tons in one day from a single\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nFrom the United States we have authentic accounts of an average\r\nproduction of 1,120 tons per furnace per week having been attained,\r\nand that even this great output has lately been considerably exceeded\r\nthere. Both as to consumption of fuel and wear and tear, per ton of\r\niron produced, these enormous outputs are attended with economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT OF THE BLAST.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Consett furnace they were obtained although the\r\nheat of the blast was under 1,100° Fahr., while heats of 1,500° to\r\n1,600° are not uncommon at the present day in brick stoves, thanks to\r\nthe application of the regenerating principle of ex-president Sir W.\r\nSiemens.\r\n\r\nBut an economy which promises to be of great importance is now sought\r\nin the recovery and useful application of those constituents of coal\r\nwhich, in the coking process, have hitherto been lost; or, as an\r\nalternative, in a similar recovery in those cases in which the coal is\r\ncharged in a raw state into the blast furnace, as is the practice in\r\nScotland and elsewhere. This recovery of the hydrocarbons and the\r\nnitrogen contained in the coal, and their collection as tar and\r\nammoniacal liquors, and subsequent conversion into sulphate of ammonia\r\nas to the latter, and into the various light and heavy paraffin oils\r\nand the residual pitch as to the former, have now been carried on for\r\na considerable time at two of the Gartsherrie furnaces; and they are\r\nalready engaged in applying the necessary apparatus to eight more\r\nfurnaces. In the coke oven the recovery of these by-products--if that\r\nname can be properly applied to substances which yield the most\r\nbrilliant colors, the purest illuminants, and the flesh-forming\r\nconstituents supplied by the vegetable world--would appear at first\r\nsight to be simpler; but it has presented its own peculiar\r\ndifficulties; the chief of which was, or was believed to be, a\r\ndeterioration in the quality of what has hitherto been the principal,\r\nbut what may, perhaps, come to be regarded hereafter as the residual\r\nproduct, namely, the coke. But the more recent experience of Messrs.\r\nPease, at Crook, appears not to justify this opinion. You will see on\r\nour table specimens of the coke produced in the Carves-Simon oven,\r\nyielding 75 to 77 per cent. of coke from the Pease's West coal, which\r\nthey have now had at work for several months. Twenty-five of these\r\novens are at work, and the average yield of ammoniacal liquor per ton\r\nof coal has been 30 gallons of a strength of 7° Twaddell, valued at\r\n1d. per gallon at the ovens; the quantity of tar per ton has been 7\r\ngallons, valued at 3d. per gallon. These products would therefore\r\nrealize 4s. 3d. per ton of coal. Of course the profit on the ton of\r\ncoke is considerably more, and to this has to be added the value of\r\nthe additional weight of coke, which in the ordinary beehive ovens\r\nfrom coal of the same quality is only 60 per cent. or in beehive ovens\r\nhaving bottom flues about 66 per cent., while in the Carves ovens it\r\nis, as I have said, upward of 75 per cent. Against these figures there\r\nis a charge of 1s. 4d. per ton of coke for additional labor, including\r\nall the labor in collecting the by-products; the interest on the first\r\ncost of the plant, which is considerable, and probably some outlay for\r\nrepairs in excess of that in the case of ordinary ovens, has also to\r\nbe charged. Mr. Jameson takes credit for the combustible gas, which is\r\nused up in the Carves ovens, but which remains over in his process,\r\nand is available, though not nearly all consumed, in raising steam for\r\nthe various purposes of a colliery, including, no doubt, before long,\r\nthe generation of electricity for its illumination. It is right to\r\nstate that prior to 1879 Mr. Henry Aitken had applied bottom flues for\r\ntaking off the oil and ammoniacal water to beehive ovens at the Almond\r\nIronworks, near Falkirk. He states that the largest quantity of oil\r\nobtained was eleven gallons, the specific gravity varying from 0.925\r\nto 1.000, and that the water contained a quantity of ammonia fully\r\nequal to 5½ lb. of sulphate of ammonia to the ton of coal coked. The\r\nresidual permanent or non-condensed gases were allowed to issue from\r\nthe end of the condenser pipe, and were burnt for light in the\r\nengine-houses, but it was intended to force them into the oven again\r\nabove the level of the coke. Owing to the works being closed, nothing\r\nhas been done with these ovens for some years. I may mention, by the\r\nway, that it is proposed to apply the principle of Mr. Jameson's\r\nprocess to the recovery of oil and ammonia from the smouldering waste\r\nheaps at the pit-bank, by the introduction into these of conduits\r\nresembling those which he applies to the bottom of the beehive oven.\r\nThere is every reason to expect that one or more of these various\r\nmethods of utilizing valuable products which are at present lost will\r\nbe carried to perfection, and will tend to cheapen the cost at which\r\niron can be produced, and still further to increase its consumption\r\nfor all the multifarious purposes to which it is applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDERFUL USES AND DEMAND FOR IRON AND STEEL.\r\n\r\nBut the world's annual production of 20,000,000 tons of pig iron is\r\nitself sufficiently startling, and without attempting to present to\r\nyou the statistics of all its various uses--for which, in fact, we do\r\nnot possess the necessary materials--the increased consumption of more\r\nthan 9,000,000 tons since 1869 becomes conceivable when we consider\r\nhow some of the great works in which it is employed have been\r\nextending during that or even a shorter interval. And of these I need\r\nonly speak of the world's railways, of which there were in 1872\r\n155,000 miles, and in 1882 not less than 260,000, but probably more\r\nnearly 265,000 miles. In the United States alone about 60,000 miles\r\nof railway have been built since 1869--the year, I may remind you in\r\npassing, in which the Atlantic and Pacific States of the Union were\r\nfirst united by a railway; while in our Indian Empire the\r\ncommunication between Calcutta and Bombay was not completed till the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of iron and steel for wood in the construction of\r\nships, and the enormous increase in the tonnage of the world, in spite\r\nof the economy arising from the employment of steamers in place of\r\nsailing ships, is perhaps the element of increased consumption next in\r\nimportance to that of railways. I do not think that the materials are\r\navailable for estimating with any accuracy the amount of this\r\nincrease, but I believe I am rather understating it if I take the\r\nconsumption of iron and steel used last year throughout the world in\r\nshipbuilding as having required considerably more than 1,000,000 tons\r\nof pig iron for its production, and that this is not far short of four\r\ntimes the quantity used for the same purpose before 1870. And so all\r\nthe other great works in which iron and steel are employed have\r\nincreased throughout the world. It would be tedious to indicate them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nAmong those which rank next in importance to the preceding, I will\r\nonly name the works for the distribution of water and gas, which in\r\nthis country and in the United States have been extended in a ratio\r\nfar greater than that of the increase of the population, and which,\r\nsince the conclusion of the Franco-German war, and the consolidation\r\nof the German and Italian States, are now to be found in almost every\r\nEuropean town of even secondary importance; and bridges and piers, in\r\nthe construction of which iron has almost entirely superseded every\r\nother material.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine what would have been the state of the iron\r\nindustry in this country if we had been called upon to supply our full\r\nproportion of the enormously increased demand for iron. To meet that\r\nproportion, the British production of pig iron should have been close\r\non 11,000,000 tons in 1882, a drain on our mineral resources which\r\ncannot be replaced, and which, especially if continued in the same\r\nratio, would have been anything but desirable. Fortunately, as I am\r\ndisposed to think, other countries have contributed more than a\r\nproportionate amount to the increase in the world's demand; and,\r\nparadoxical as it may appear, it is possible that, to this country at\r\nleast, the encouragement given by protective duties to the production\r\nof iron abroad may have been a blessing in disguise.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF BESSEMER STEEL.\r\n\r\nTo speak of the enormous increase in the production of steel by the\r\nintroduction of the Bessemer process has become a commonplace on\r\noccasions like the present, and yet I doubt whether its real\r\ndimensions are generally known or remembered. In 1869 the manufacture\r\nof Bessemer steel had already acquired what was then looked upon as a\r\nconsiderable development in all the principal centers of metallurgical\r\nindustry, except the United States, but including our own country,\r\nGermany, France, and Austria, and the world's production in that year\r\nwas 400,000 tons. Last year it was over 5,000,000 tons, and it has\r\ndoubled in every steel-producing country during the last four years,\r\nexcept in France, where, during this latter period, the increase has\r\nnot been much more than one-fourth. What is almost as remarkable as\r\nthe enormous increase in the production of Bessemer steel is the great\r\ndiminution in its cost. In the years preceding 1875, the price of\r\nrails manufactured from Bessemer ingots fluctuated between £10 and £18\r\nper ton, and I remember Lord George Hamilton when he was\r\nUnder-Secretary for India of Lord Beaconsfield's administration in\r\n1875 or 1876, congratulating himself on his good fortune in having\r\nbeen able to secure a quantity of steel rails for the Indian\r\ngovernment at £13 per ton. Within the last three years we have seen\r\nthem sold under £4 10s. in this country, and £5 10s. in Germany and\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATEST IMPROVEMENTS IN IRON MAKING.\r\n\r\nThis great reduction is the cumulative result of a number of\r\nconcurrent improvements, partly in the conversion of the iron, and\r\npartly in the subsequent treatment of the ingot steel. In most of the\r\ngreat steelworks the iron is no longer remelted, but is transferred\r\ndirect from the blast furnace to the converter, a practice which\r\noriginated at Terre-Noire, and was long considered in this country to\r\nbe incompatible with uniformity in the quality of the steel produced.\r\nThe turn-out of the converter plant has been gradually increased in\r\nthis country to more than four times that of fourteen years ago, while\r\nthe practice of the United States is stated by a recent visitor to\r\nhave reached such an astounding figure that I am afraid to quote it\r\nwithout confirmation; but the greatest economy arises no doubt in the\r\nlabor and fuel employed in the mill.\r\n\r\nCogging has taken the place of hammering. Even wash-heating will be,\r\nif it is not already, generally dispensed with by the soaking process\r\nof our colleague, Mr. Gjers, which permits of the ingot, as it leaves\r\nthe pit, being directly converted into a rail.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEEL RAILS 150 FEET LONG.\r\n\r\nAn extract from a letter addressed to me by our colleague, Mr. E.W.\r\nRichards, will describe better than any words of mine the perfection\r\nat which steel rail mills have arrived. He says, \"Our cogging rolls\r\nare 48 in. diameter, and the roughing and finishing rolls are 30 in.\r\ndiameter. We roll rails 150 feet long as easily as they used to roll\r\n21 feet. Our ingots are 15½ inches square, and weigh from 25 to 30\r\ncwts. according to the weight of rail we have to roll. These heavy\r\ningots are all handled by machinery. We convey them by small\r\nlocomotives from the Bessemer shop to the heating furnaces, and by the\r\nsame means from the heating furnaces to the cogging rolls.\r\n\r\nSo quickly are these ingots now handled that we have given up second\r\nheating altogether, so that after one heat the ingot is cogged from\r\n15½ inches square down to 8 inches square, then at once passed on to\r\nthe roughing and finishing rolls, and finished in lengths, as I have\r\nsaid before, of 150 ft., then cut at the hot saws to the lengths given\r\nin the specifications, and varying from 38 ft. to about 21 ft. The 38\r\nft. lengths are used by the Italian 'Meridionali' Railway Company, and\r\nfound to give very satisfactory results.\" I need scarcely say that in\r\na mill like this, the expenditure of fuel and labor and the loss by\r\nwaste caused by crop ends are reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC STEEL.\r\n\r\nThe enormous production of steel has required the importation of large\r\nquantities of iron ore of pure quality from Spain, Algeria, and\r\nelsewhere, into this country, France, Belgium, Germany, and the United\r\nStates; and these supplies have contributed greatly to the reduction\r\nin the price of steel to which I have referred, and what is, perhaps,\r\nof equal importance, they have prevented the great fluctuations of\r\nprice which formerly prevailed. In 1869 this trade was in its infancy,\r\nand almost confined to the importation of the Algerian ores of Mokta\r\nel Hadid into France, while in 1882 Bilbao alone exported 3,700,000\r\ntons of hematite ores to various countries to which the exports from\r\nthe south of Spain, Algeria, Elba, Greece, and other countries have to\r\nbe added. Great Britain alone imported 3,000,000 tons of high class,\r\nincluding manganiferous iron ores last year.\r\n\r\nIt is questionable whether the mines of pure iron existing in Europe\r\nwould long bear a drain so great and still increasing; but happily the\r\nquestion no longer presses for an answer, because the problem of\r\nobtaining first-class steel from inferior ores has been solved by the\r\ngenius of our colleagues, Mr. Snelus and Messrs. Thomas and Gilchrist,\r\nand by the practical skill and indomitable resolution of Mr. Windsor\r\nRichards. It is no part of the duty of the Institute to assign to each\r\nof these gentlemen his precise share in the development of the basic\r\nprocess. Whatever those shares may be, I feel sure you will agree with\r\nyour council as to the propriety of their having awarded a Bessemer\r\nmedal to two of these gentlemen--Messrs. Snelus and Thomas--to Mr.\r\nSnelus as the first who made pure steel from impure iron in a Bessemer\r\nconverter lined with basic materials; to Mr. Thomas, who solved the\r\nsame problem independently, and so clearly demonstrated its\r\npracticability to Mr. Richards by the trials at Blaenavon, as to have\r\nled that gentleman to devote all his energies and the great resources\r\nof the Eston Works to the task of making it what it now is, a great\r\ncommercial success. All difficulties connected with the lining of the\r\nconverter and in insuring a durability of the bottom, nearly, if not\r\nquite, equal to that in the acid process, appear now to have been\r\nsuccessfully surmounted, and I am informed by Mr. Gilchrist that the\r\npresent production of basic steel in this country and on the Continent\r\nis already at the rate of considerably more than 500,000 tons per\r\nannum, and that works are now in course of construction which will\r\nincrease this quantity to more than a million tons.\r\n\r\nOur members will have the opportunity of seeing the process at work\r\nduring their visit to Middlesbrough, at the Eston Works of Messrs.\r\nBolckow, Vaughan & Co., which are now producing 150,000 tons per annum\r\nof steel of the highest quality from the phosphoretic Cleveland ores;\r\nand also at the North-Eastern Steel Company's Works. I believe it is\r\nthe intention of the latter company to make a pure, soft steel\r\nsuitable for plates, for which, according to the testimony of Mons.\r\nDelafond, of Creuzot, and others, the basic steel is peculiarly\r\nsuitable on account of its remarkable regularity. I shall have the\r\npleasure of presenting to Mr. Snelus the medal which he has so well\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONORS AND REWARDS TO INVENTORS.\r\n\r\nThe presentation to Mr. Thomas is deferred. His arduous labors having\r\naffected his health, he is at present in Australia, after having, I am\r\nhappy to say, received great advantage from the voyage; and his\r\nmother, justly proud of his merits, and appreciating fully the value\r\nof their recognition by the award which we have made, has requested us\r\nnot to present the medal by proxy, but to await the return of her son,\r\nin order that it may be handed to him in person. But honors, whether\r\nconferred by the Crown, by learned bodies, or, as in this case, by the\r\ncolleagues of the recipient, though they stimulate invention, are by\r\nthemselves not always sufficient to encourage inventors to devote\r\ntheir labor to the improvements of manufactures or to induce\r\ncapitalists to assist inventors in the prosecution of costly\r\nexperiments; and it is on this account that the protection of\r\ninventions by patent is a public advantage. The members of our\r\nprofession, unlike some others, have not been eager to apply for\r\npatents in the case of minor inventions; on the contrary, they have\r\nfreely communicated to each other the experience as to improvement in\r\ndetail which have resulted from their daily practice. It has been well\r\nsaid that all the world is wiser than any one man in it, and this free\r\ninterchange of our various experiences has tended greatly to the\r\nadvancement of our trade. But new departures, like the great invention\r\nof Sir H. Bessemer, and important improvements like the basic process,\r\nrequire the protection of patents for their development.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PATENT LAWS.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the patent laws is, therefore, of interest to us, as it\r\nis to other manufacturers. You are aware that the Government has\r\nintroduced a bill for amending these laws. If that bill should pass,\r\nit will effect several important changes. It will, in the first place,\r\nenable a poor man to obtain protection for an invention at a small\r\ncost; secondly, it will make it more difficult than at present for a\r\nmerely pretended invention to obtain the protection and prestige of a\r\npatent; thirdly, it will promote the amalgamation of mutually\r\ninterdependent inventions by the clause which compels patentees to\r\ngrant licenses; and, lastly, it will enable the Government to enter\r\ninto treaties with other powers for the international protection of\r\ninventions. If you should be of opinion that these are objects\r\ndeserving of your support, I hope that you will induce your\r\nrepresentatives in the House of Commons to do all that is in their\r\npower to assist the Government in passing them into law.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF THE SIEMENS-MARTIN PROCESS.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the open hearth or what is known as the Siemens-Martin\r\nprocess of making steel, during the interval from 1869 to the present\r\ntime, has been no less remarkable than that of the Bessemer process;\r\nfor though it has not attained the enormous dimensions of the latter,\r\nit has risen from smaller beginnings. Mr. Ramsbottom started a small\r\nopen-hearth plant at the Crewe Works of the London and North-Western\r\nRailway, in 1868, for making railway tires, and the Landore Works were\r\nbegun by Sir W. Siemens in the same year. On the Continent there were\r\na few furnaces at the works of M. Emile Martin, at the Firming Works,\r\nand at Le Creuzot. None of these works, I believe, possessed furnaces\r\nbefore 1870, capable of containing more than four-ton charges,\r\nordinarily worked off twice in twenty-four hours. The ingots weighed\r\nabout 6 cwt., and the largest steel casting made by this process, of\r\nwhich I can find any account, did not exceed 10 cwt. At the present\r\nday, we have furnaces of a capacity of from 15 to 25 tons, and by\r\ncombining several furnaces, single ingots weighing from 120 to 125\r\ntons have been produced at Le Creuzot. The world's production of\r\nopen-hearth steel ingots for ship and boiler plates, propeller shafts,\r\nordnance, wheels and axles, wire billets, armor plates, castings of\r\nvarious kinds, and a multiplicity of other articles, cannot have been\r\nless than from 800,000 to 850,000 tons in 1882.\r\n\r\nThe process itself has followed two somewhat dissimilar lines. In this\r\ncountry, iron ores of a pure quality are dissolved in a bath of pig\r\niron, with the addition of only small quantities of scrap steel and\r\niron. At Le Creuzot large quantities of wrought iron are melted in\r\nthe bath. This iron is puddled in modified rotating Danks furnaces\r\ncontaining a charge of a ton each. The furnaces have a mid-rib\r\ndividing the product into two balls of 10 cwt., which are shingled\r\nunder a 10-ton hammer. The iron is of exceptional purity, containing\r\nless than 0.01 per cent. of phosphorus and sulphur. I should add that\r\nthe two rotating furnaces produce 50 tons of billets in twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT PRODUCTION OF WROUGHT IRON.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the world's production of wrought iron has not been\r\nstationary. I cannot give very accurate figures, as the statistics of\r\nsome countries are incomplete, while in others the output of puddled\r\nbar only, and not that of finished iron, has been ascertained. The\r\nnearest estimate which I can arrive at is a production increased from\r\nabout 5,000,000 tons in 1869 to somewhat over 8,000,000 tons of\r\nfinished iron in 1882; an increase all the more remarkable when it is\r\nconsidered that at the present time iron rails have been almost\r\nentirely superseded by steel. It is due, no doubt, in part to the\r\nextensive use of iron plates and angles in shipbuilding; but, apart\r\nfrom these, and from bars for the manufacture of tin-plates, the\r\nconsumption has increased for the numberless purposes to which it is\r\napplied in the world's economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF PUDDLING.\r\n\r\nThere has been no striking improvement in the manufacture of puddled\r\niron, partly on account of the impression that it is doomed to be\r\nsuperseded by steel. Mechanical puddling has made but little progress,\r\nand few of the attempts to economize fuel in the puddling furnace, by\r\nthe use of gas or otherwise, have been successful. I would, however,\r\ndraw attention to the remarkable success which has attended the use of\r\nthe Bicheroux gas puddling and heating furnaces at the works of\r\nOugrée, near Liege. The works produce 20,000 tons of puddled bars per\r\nannum, in fifteen double furnaces. The consumption of coal per ton of\r\nordinary puddled bar is under 11 cwt., and per ton of \"fer à fin\r\ngrain\" (puddled steel, etc.) 16 cwt. The gas is produced from slack,\r\nand the waste heat raises as much steam as that from an ordinary\r\ndouble furnace. The consumption of pig iron per ton of puddled bar was\r\nrather less than 21½ cwts. for the year 1882; and that of \"mine\" for\r\nfettling was 33 lb. The repairs are said to be considerably less than\r\nin the ordinary furnaces, and the puddlers earn from 25 to 30 per\r\ncent. more at the same tonnage rate. I have already mentioned the\r\nlarge consumption, reckoned in tons of pig iron, of the materials for\r\nshipbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROSS OF IRON AND STEEL SHIP BUILDING.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to add that the gross tonnage of iron vessels classed\r\nduring 1882 by the three societies of Lloyd's, the Liverpool Registry,\r\nand the Bureau Veritas was 1,142,000, and of steel 143,000 tons, and\r\nthat the proportion of steel to iron vessels is increasing from year\r\nto year. I am informed by our colleague, Mr. Pearce, of Messrs.\r\nElder's firm, that the largest vessel built by them in 1869 was an\r\niron steamer, of 3,063 tons gross, with compound engines of 3,000\r\nhorse power, working at 60 lb. pressure; speed, 14 knots.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GIGANTIC STEAMER.\r\n\r\nThe largest vessel now on the ways is the Oregon, of 7,400 tons gross,\r\nand 13,000 horse power; estimated speed, 18 knots. The superficial\r\narea of the largest plates in the former was 22½ square feet; that of\r\nthe largest plate in the latter is 206 square feet. The Oregon is an\r\niron vessel, but some of the largest vessels now being built by Mr.\r\nPearce's firm are of steel.\r\n\r\nThe information which I have obtained from Messrs. Thomson, of\r\nGlasgow, is especially emphatic as to the supersession of iron by\r\nsteel in the construction of ships. They say that large steel plates\r\nare as cheap as iron ones, and that they have never had one bad plate\r\nor angle in steel. This is confirmed by Mr. Denny, who says: \"Whenever\r\nour shipwrights or smiths have to turn out anything particularly\r\ndifficult in shape, and on which much 'work' has to be put, they will\r\nget hold of a piece of steel if they can.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE MACHINERY AND TOOLS.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that the rolls, the hammers, the\r\nmachinery for punching, drilling, planing, etc., used in the\r\nmanufacture and preparation of plates and angles for shipbuilding and\r\narmor plates are on a scale far different at the present date from\r\nwhat they were in 1869. Perhaps the most striking examples of powerful\r\nmachinery for these purposes are the great Creuzot hammer, the falling\r\nmass of which has recently been increased to 100 tons, and the new\r\nplaning machines at the Cyclops Works, which weigh upward of 140 tons\r\neach, for planing compound armor plates 19 in. thick and weighing 57\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF IRON AND STEEL.\r\n\r\nSome of the eminent men who have preceded me in this chair have made\r\ntheir inaugural address the occasion for a forecast of the\r\nimprovements in practice and the developments in area of the great\r\nindustry in which we are engaged. Several of these forecasts have been\r\nverified by the results; in other cases they have proved to be\r\nmistaken; nor need this excite surprise. I believe that few would have\r\npredicted, when the consideration of the subject was somewhat\r\nunfortunately deferred through want of time at our Paris meeting of\r\n1878, that the basic process would so speedily prove itself to be of\r\nsuch paramount value as we now know it to possess. On the other hand,\r\nthe extinction of the old puddling process has long been the favorite\r\ntopic of one of our most practical ex-presidents, and I have shown you\r\nby figures that the process is not only not yet dead, but that the\r\nmanufacture of wrought iron is actually flourishing side by side with\r\nthat of its younger brother, steel. How much longer this may continue\r\nto be the case it would not be easy to foretell, but there can be\r\nlittle doubt that, just as for rails steel has superseded iron as\r\nbeing cheaper and vastly more durable, so it will be in regard to\r\nplates for constructive purposes, and especially for shipbuilding. It\r\nis now an ascertained fact that steel ships are as cheap, ton for ton\r\nof carrying capacity, as iron ones, and it is probable that as the\r\ndemand for, and consequently the production of, steel plates\r\nincreases, steel ships will become cheaper than those built of iron;\r\nbut, what is more important, they have been proved to be safer, and no\r\ntime can long elapse before this will tell on the premiums of\r\ninsurance. Steel forgings also are superseding, and must to an\r\nincreasing extent, supersede iron; while it is probable that the\r\nformer will in their turn be replaced for many purposes by the\r\nbeautiful solid steel castings which are now being produced by the\r\nTerre-Noire Company in France, the Steel Company of Scotland, and\r\nother manufacturers, by the Siemens-Martin process. On this subject I\r\nbelieve Mr. Parker can give us valuable information; and on a cognate\r\nbranch, namely, the production of steel castings from the Bessemer\r\nconverter, an interesting paper will be submitted to us by Mr. Allen\r\nat our present meeting.\r\n\r\nI may here mention incidentally, that I have of late had occasion to\r\nmake trials on a considerable scale of edge tools made from Bessemer\r\nsteel, which show that, except perhaps in the case of the finest\r\ncutlery, there is no longer any occasion to resort to the crucible for\r\nthe production of this quality of steel.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY DEMAND FOR IRON AND STEEL.\r\n\r\nBut it is in the further development of the world's railways that we\r\nmust mainly look in the future, as in the past, for the support of our\r\ntrade. In India the railway between Calcutta and Bombay was only\r\ncompleted in 1870, and at the present time, with a population of\r\n250,000,000, it has less than 10,000 miles of railway, while the\r\nUnited States, with only 50,000,000, possesses more than 100,000\r\nmiles. In other words, the United States have fifty times as many\r\nmiles of railway in relation to the population as India. Even Russia\r\nin Europe has 14,000 miles, or, in relation to its population, nearly\r\nfive times as great a mileage as our Indian Empire; and the existing\r\nIndian railways are so successful pecuniarily, and give such promise\r\nof contributing to the wealth of the Indian people--or perhaps it\r\nwould be more just to say, of rescuing them from their present state\r\nof poverty and depression--that it should be the aim of those who are\r\nresponsible for the well-being of our great dependency to give to its\r\nrailways the utmost and most rapid development.\r\n\r\nAs to the United States themselves, I look upon their railways as a\r\nlittle more than the main arteries from which an indefinitely large\r\ncirculating system will branch out. Besides these countries I need\r\nonly allude to the Dominion of Canada, whose vast territory bids fair\r\nto rival that of the United States in agricultural importance, to our\r\nAustralian colonies, to Brazil, and other countries in which railways\r\nare still comparatively in their infancy, to show that, quite apart\r\nfrom the renewal of existing lines, the world's manufacture of rails\r\nhas an enormous future before it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND WORKMEN.\r\n\r\nI look on the excellent feeling which happily prevails between the\r\nemployers and the workmen in our great industry as another of the most\r\nimportant elements of its future prosperity. It confers honor on all\r\nconcerned that by our Boards of Conciliation and Arbitration, ruinous\r\nstrikes, and even momentary suspensions of labor, are avoided; and\r\nstill more that masters like our esteemed Treasurer, Mr. David Dale,\r\nshould deserve, and that large bodies of workmen should have the\r\nmanliness and discernment to bestow on him, the confidence implied in\r\nchoosing him so frequently as an arbitrator. I believe that similar\r\nfriendly relations exist in some, at any rate, of the other great\r\ncenters of the iron and steel industries, and that although our\r\nmethods may not be adapted to the habits of all, there is no country\r\nin which some way does not exist, or may not be found, to avoid those\r\ncontests which were so fatal to our prosperity in former days. Lastly\r\nI regard as one of the most hopeful signs of the future the increased\r\nestimate of the value of science entertained by our practical men. In\r\nthis respect we may claim with pride that the Iron and Steel Institute\r\nhas been the pioneer, at any rate, so far as this country is\r\nconcerned. But the conviction that the elements of science should be\r\nplaced within the reach of those who occupy a humbler position in the\r\nindustrial hierarchy than we do who are assembled here is rapidly\r\nspreading among us. The iron manufacturers of Westphalia have been the\r\nfirst to found an institution in which the intelligent and ambitious\r\nironworker can qualify himself by study for a higher position, and I\r\nhope when this Institute visits Middlesbrough in the autumn, some\r\nprogress will have been made in that locality toward the establishment\r\nof a similar school. Other districts will doubtless follow, and the\r\nresult will be, to quote the words of Sir W. Siemens on a late\r\noccasion, that \"by the dissemination of science a higher spirit will\r\ntake possession of our artisans; that they will work with the object\r\nof obtaining higher results, instead of only discussing questions of\r\nwages.\" It is on the mutual co-operation in this spirit of all the\r\nworkers of every grade in our great craft that we may build the\r\nhope--nay, that we may even cherish the certain expectation--of\r\nplacing it on even a higher eminence than that which it has already\r\nattained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"SWALLOW,\" A NEW VEHICLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graceful vehicle shown in the accompanying cut is much used in\r\nPoland and Russia, and we believe that it has already made its\r\nappearance at Paris. The builder is Mr. Henri Barycki, of Warsaw, who\r\nhas very skillfully utilized a few very curious mechanical principles\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SWALLOW.]\r\n\r\nThe driver's seat is fixed in the interior of a wide ring to which are\r\nfastened the shafts. This ring revolves, by the aid of three pulleys\r\nor small wheels, within the large ring resting on the ground. It will\r\nbe seen that when the horse is drawing the vehicle, the friction of\r\nthis large wheel against the ground being greater than that of the\r\nconcentric one within it, the latter will revolve until the center of\r\ngravity of the whole is situated anew in a line vertical to the point\r\nat which it bears on the ground. The result of such an arrangement is\r\nthat the driver rolls on the large wheel just as he would do on the\r\nsurface of an endless rail. As may be conceived, the tractive stress\r\nis, as a consequence, considerably diminished.\r\n\r\nThere are two side wheels which are connected by a flexible axle to\r\nthe seat of the carriage, but these have no other purpose than that of\r\npreventing the affair from turning to one side or the other.\r\n\r\nThe \"swallow,\" for so it is named, is made entirely of steel and\r\nwrought iron. It is very easily kept clean; the horse can be harnessed\r\nto it in three minutes; and, aside from its uses for pleasure, it is\r\ncapable of being utilized in numerous ways.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n[Our excellent contemporary, _La Nature_, is mistaken in its account\r\nof the above vehicle. It is an American invention and was first\r\npublished, with engraving, in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, December 16,\r\n1882.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORING AN OIL WELL.\r\n\r\nHOW THE HOLE WAS MADE AND THE OIL BROUGHT UP.\r\n\r\n\r\nA letter from Bradford, Pa., says: The machinery used in boring one of\r\nthese deep oil wells, while simple enough in itself, requires nice\r\nadjustment and skill in operating. First comes the derrick, sixty feet\r\nhigh, crowned by a massive pulley.\r\n\r\nThe derrick is a most essential part of the mechanism, and its shape\r\nand height are needed in handling the long rods, piping, casting, and\r\nother fittings which have to be inserted perpendicularly. The borer or\r\ndrill used is not much different from the ordinary hand arm of the\r\nstone cutters, and the blade is exactly the same, but is of massive\r\nsize, three or four inches across, about four feet long, and weighing\r\n100 or 200 pounds. A long solid rod, some thirty feet long, three\r\ninches in diameter, and called the \"stem,\" is screwed on the drill.\r\nThis stem weighs almost a ton, and its weight is the hammer relied on\r\nfor driving the drill through dirt and rock. Next come the \"jars,\" two\r\nlong loose links of hardened iron playing along each other about a\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nThe object of the jars is to raise the drill with a shock, so as to\r\ndetach it when so tightly fixed that a steady pull would break the\r\nmachinery. The upper part of the two jars is solidly welded to another\r\nlong rod called the sinker bar, to the upper end of which, in turn, is\r\nattached the rope leading up to the derrick pulley, and thence to a\r\nstationary steam engine. In boring, the stem and drill are raised a\r\nfoot or two, dropped, then raised with a shock by the jars, and the\r\noperation repeated.\r\n\r\nIf I may hazard a further illustration of the internal boring\r\nmachinery of the well, let the reader link loosely together the thumbs\r\nand forefingers of his two hands, then bring his forearms into a\r\nstraight line. Conceiving this line to be a perpendicular one, the\r\npoint of one elbow would represent the drill blade, the adjacent\r\nforearm and hand the stem, the linked finger the jars, and the other\r\nhand and forearm the sinker bar, with the derrick cord attached at a\r\npoint represented by the second elbow. By remembering the immense and\r\nconcentrated weight of the upright drill and stem, the tremendous\r\nforce of even a short fall may be conceived. The drill will bore many\r\nfeet in a single day through solid rock, and a few hours sometimes\r\nsuffices to force it fifty feet through dirt or gravel. When the\r\ndebris accumulates too thickly around the drill, the latter is drawn\r\nup rapidly. The debris has previously been reduced to mud by keeping\r\nthe drill surrounded by water. A sand pump, not unlike an ordinary\r\nsyringe, is then let down, the mud sucked up, lifted, and then the\r\ndrill sent down to begin its pounding anew. Great deftness and\r\nexperience are needed to work the drill without breaking the jars or\r\nconnected machinery, and, in case of accident, there are grapples,\r\nhooks, knives, and other devices without number, to be used in\r\nrecovering lost drills, cutting the rope, and other emergencies, the\r\nbriefest explanation of which would exceed the limits of this letter.\r\n\r\nThe exciting moment in boring a well is when a drill is penetrating\r\nthe upper covering of sand rock which overlies the oil. The force with\r\nwhich the compressed gas and petroleum rushes upward almost surpasses\r\nbelief. Drill, jars, and sinker bar are sometimes shot out along with\r\ndebris, oil, and hissing gas. Sometimes this gas and oil take fire,\r\nand last summer one of the wells thus ignited burned so fiercely that\r\na number of days elapsed before the flames could be extinguished. More\r\noften the tankage provided is insufficient, and thousands of barrels\r\nescape. Two or three years ago, at the height of the oil production of\r\nthe Bradford region, 8,000 barrels a day were thus running to waste.\r\nBut those halcyon days of Bradford have gone forever. Although\r\nnineteen-twentieths of the wells sunk in this region \"struck\" oil and\r\nflowed freely, most of them now flow sluggishly or have to be \"pumped\"\r\ntwo or three times a week.\r\n\r\n\"Piping\" and \"casing,\" terms substantially identical, and meaning the\r\nlining of the well with iron pipe several inches in the interior\r\ndiameter, complete the labor of boring. The well, if a good flowing\r\none, does all the rest of the work itself, forcing the fluid into the\r\nlocal tanks, whence it is distributed into the tanks of the pipe-line\r\ncompanies, and is carried from them to the refineries. The pipe lines\r\nnow reach from the oil regions to the seaboard, carrying the petroleum\r\nover hill and valley, hundreds of miles to tide-water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CEMENT RESERVOIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annexed figures represent, on a scale of 1 to 50, a plan and\r\nvertical section of a reservoir of beton, 11 cubic meters in capacity,\r\ndesigned for the storage of drinking water and for collecting the\r\noverflow of a canal. The volume of beton employed in its construction\r\nwas 0.9 cubic meter per cubic meter of water to be stored.

The Alauzet machine, shown in the accompanying\r\ncut, is designed to perform this work mechanically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALAUZET'S MACHINE FOR GRINDING LITHOGRAPHIC INKS.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a flat, cast iron, rectangular frame,\r\nresting upon a wooden base which forms a closet. In a longitudinal\r\ndirection there is mounted on the machine a rectangular guide, along\r\nwhich travel two iron slides in the shape of a reversed U, which make\r\npart of two smaller carriers that are loaded with weights, and to\r\nwhich are fixed cast-steel mullers.\r\n\r\nAt the center of the frame there is fixed a support which carries a\r\ntrain of gear wheels which is set in motion by a pulley and belt.\r\nThese wheels serve to communicate a backward and forward motion,\r\nlongitudinally, to the mullers through the intermedium of a winch, and\r\na backward and forward motion transversely to two granite tables on\r\nwhich is placed the ink or color to be ground. This last-named motion\r\nis effected by means of a bevel pinion which is keyed to the same axle\r\nas the large gear wheel, and which actuates a heart wheel--this latter\r\nbeing adjusted in a horizontal frame which is itself connected to the\r\ncast iron plate into which the tables are set.\r\n\r\nThis machine, which is 2 meters in length by 1 meter in width,\r\nrequires a one-third horse power to actuate it.

In addition to this it is so constructed as to\r\ngive the best of results as regards evaporation, thanks to the lengthy\r\ntravel that the current of steam makes in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERRE & QUIDET'S EVAPORATING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nIt may be seen from an examination of the annexed cuts, the apparatus\r\nconsists essentially of a cylindrical reservoir, in the interior of\r\nwhich revolves a system formed of seven pipes, with radiating disks,\r\naffixed to plate iron disks, EE. The reservoir is mounted upon a\r\ncast-iron frame, and is provided at its lower part with a cock, B,\r\nwhich permits of the liquid being drawn off when it has been\r\nsufficiently concentrated. It is surmounted with a cover, which is\r\nbolted to lateral flanges, so that the two parts as a whole constitute\r\na complete cylinder. This shape, however, is not essential, and the\r\ninventors reserve the right of giving it the arrangement that may be\r\nbest adapted to the application that is to be made of it.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the apparatus there is a conduit whose diameter is\r\ngreater than that of the pipes provided with radiators, and which\r\nserves to cross-brace the two ends, EE, which latter consist of iron\r\nboxes cast in a piece with the hollow shaft of the rotary system.\r\n\r\nThe steam enters through the pipe, F, traverses the first evaporating\r\npipe, then the second, then the third, and so on, and continues to\r\ncirculate in this manner till it finally reaches the last one, which\r\ncommunicates with the exit, G.\r\n\r\nMotion is transmitted to the evaporator by a gearing, H, which is\r\nkeyed on the shaft, and is actuated by a pinion, L, connected with an\r\nintermediate shaft which is provided with fast and loose pulleys.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is very efficient in its action, and this is due, in the\r\nfirst place, to the use of radiators, which greatly increase the\r\nheating surface, and second, to the motion communicated to the\r\nevaporating parts. In fact, each of the pipes, on issuing from the\r\nliquid to be concentrated, carries upon its entire surface a pellicle\r\nwhich evaporates immediately.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement devised by Messrs. Perré and Quidet realizes, then,\r\nthe best theoretic conditions for this sort of work, to wit:\r\n\r\n    1. A large evaporating surface.\r\n    2. A very slight thickness of liquid.\r\n    3. A constant temperature of about from 100° to 120°, according\r\n       to the internal pressure of the steam.\r\n\r\nOwing to such advantages, this apparatus will find an application in\r\nnumerous industries, and will render them many services.--_Revue\r\nIndustrielle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FLYING.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American:_\r\n\r\nYour correspondent on this subject in the issue of April 14 cites an\r\narray of facts from which it would seem the proper conclusions should\r\nbe inferred. I think the whole difficulty arises from a confusion of\r\nterms, and by this I mean a want of care to explain the unknown\r\nstrictly in terms of the known; and I think underlying this error is a\r\nmisconception as to what an animal is, and what animal strength is,\r\nonly of course with reference to this particular discussion, i.e.,\r\nin so far only as they may be considered physical organisms having no\r\nreference to the intellectual or moral development, all of which lies\r\nbeyond the sphere of our discussion.\r\n\r\nPurely with reference to the development of physical strength, which\r\nalone is under consideration, any animal organism whatsoever must be\r\nconsidered simply in the light of a machine.\r\n\r\nA compound machine having two parts, first an arrangement of levers\r\nand points of application of power, all of which is purely mechanical,\r\ntogether with an arrangement of parts, designed, first, to convert\r\nfuel or food into heat, and, secondly, to transform heat into force,\r\nwhich is purely a chemical change in the first instance, and a\r\ntransformation of energy in the second. So much for the animal--man or\r\nbeast--as a machine physically considered.\r\n\r\nWhat then is animal strength considered in the same light? The animal\r\nis not creative. It can make nothing--it can only transform. Does it\r\ncreate any strength or force? No. The strength it puts forth or exerts\r\nis merely the outcome of this transformation, which it is the office\r\nof the machine to perform.\r\n\r\nWhat do we find transformed? Simply the energy, or potential,\r\ncontained in the fuel or food we put into the machine. Its exact\r\nequivalent we find transformed to another form of energy, known as\r\nanimal strength, which is simply heat within the system available for\r\nthe working of its mechanical parts. How, then, is this energy which\r\nexists in the shape of animal strength used and distributed? This is\r\nthe question the answer of which underlies this whole discussion as a\r\nprinciple. It is distributed to the different parts of the machine in\r\nproportion to the relative amount of physical work that nature has\r\nmade it the office of any particular part to perform.\r\n\r\nLet us see how it is with the bird machine. In course of flight he is\r\ncalled upon to remain in the air, which means that should he cease to\r\nmake an effort to do this, i.e., should he cease to expend energy in\r\ndoing it, he would fall during the first second of time after ceasing\r\nto make the effort some sixteen feet toward the center of the earth.\r\nBut he remains in the air for hours and days at a time. What is he,\r\nthen, doing every second of that time? He is overcoming the force of\r\ngravitation, which is incessantly pulling him down. That is, every\r\nsecond he is doing an amount of work equal to his weight--say 10 lb.\r\nmultiplied by 16--say 160 lb. approximately; all this by beating the\r\nair with his wings. Now let us institute a slight comparison--and the\r\nwork shall be performed by a man, who climbs a mountain 10,000 feet\r\nhigh in 10 hours. The man weighs 150 lb.; he climbs 10,000 feet;\r\n1,500,000 foot pounds is, then, the work done. He does it in 10 hours,\r\nor 36,000 seconds, which gives an amount of work of only 42 foot\r\npounds per second performed by his muscles of locomotion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the ten hours the man is exhausted, while the bird\r\ndelights in further flight. To what is this difference of condition\r\ndue? _It is due simply to the difference in the machine;_ but this,\r\nyou say, is not explaining the unknown in terms of the known. Let us\r\nsee, then, if we cannot do this. In the two accounts of work done as\r\nabove cited in the case of the man and the bird, an amount of energy,\r\ni.e., heat of the system, has been expended just proportional to the\r\nwork done.\r\n\r\nNow while the bird has expended more energy in this particular work of\r\nlocomotion than has the man, we find the bird machine has done little\r\nelse; he has consumed but little of his available heat force in\r\nexercising his brain or the other functions of his system, or in\r\npreserving the temperature of the body, and but little of his animal\r\nheat, which is his strength, has been radiated into space. In short,\r\nwe find the bird machine so devised by nature that a very large\r\nproportion of the available energy of the system can be used in\r\nworking those parts contrived for locomotion, and resist the force of\r\ngravity, or, what is the same thing, nature has placed a greater\r\nrelative portion of the whole furnace at the disposal of these parts\r\nthan she has in man. The breast muscles of the bird are so constructed\r\nas to burn a far greater proportional amount of the fuel from which\r\nall energy is derived than do the muscles of the rest of the body\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nLet us see how it is with the man who has climbed the mountain. In\r\nthis machine we find affairs in a very different state. During his\r\nclimbing he has been doing a vast amount of other work, both internal\r\nand external. His arms, his whole muscular system, in fact, has been\r\nvigorously at work, all drawing upon his total available energy. His\r\nbrain has been in constant and unremitted action, as well as the other\r\ninternal organs, which require a greater proportional amount of energy\r\nthan they did in the bird. Besides this, he has been radiating his\r\nanimal heat into space in a far greater amount. All these parts must\r\nbe supplied; they cannot be neglected while the accumulated surplus is\r\ngiven to the machinery for locomotion or lifting. This then is what\r\nconstitutes what I call the difference in the machine, which is purely\r\none of organic development depending upon the functions nature has\r\ndetermined that the different organs shall perform. As for the\r\npterodactyl quoted in the last article, I have only to remark that\r\nthis discussion arose purely from a consideration of what was the best\r\ntype of flying apparatus nature had given man to study, and I claim\r\nthat this prehistoric bird of geology does not come within this class.\r\nFor if it is not fully established that this species had become\r\nextinct long before the appearance of man on the globe, it is at least\r\ncertain that the man of that early day had not dreamt of flying and\r\nwas presumably content if he could find other means to evade the\r\npterodactyl's claw.\r\n\r\nF.J.P., U.S. Army.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PORTRUSH ELECTRIC RAILWAY, IRELAND.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A paper recently read before the Society of Arts,\r\nLondon.]\r\n\r\nBy DR. EDWARD HOPKINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1881, Mr. W.A. Traill, late of H.M. Geological\r\nSurvey, suggested to Dr. Siemens that the line between Portrush and\r\nBushmills, for which Parliamentary powers had been obtained, would be\r\nsuitable in many respects for electrical working, especially as there\r\nwas abundant water power available in the neighborhood. Dr. Siemens at\r\nonce joined in the undertaking, which has been carried out under his\r\ndirection. The line extends from Portrush, the terminus of the Belfast\r\nand Northern Counties Railway, to Bushmills in the Bush valley, a\r\ndistance of six miles. For about half a mile the line passes down the\r\nprincipal street of Portrush, and has an extension along the Northern\r\nCounties Railway to the harbor. For the rest of the distance, the\r\nrails are laid on the sea side of the county road, and the head of the\r\nrails being level with the ground, a footpath is formed the whole\r\ndistance, separated from the road by a curbstone. The line is single,\r\nand has a gauge of three feet, the standard of the existing narrow\r\ngauge lines in Ulster. The gradients are exceedingly heavy, as will be\r\nseen from the diagram, being in parts as steep as 1 in 35. The curves\r\nare also in many cases very sharp, having necessarily to follow the\r\nexisting road. There are five passing places, in addition to the\r\nsidings at the termini and at the carriage depot. At the Bushmills\r\nend, the line is laid for about 200 yards along the street, and ends\r\nin the marketplace of the town. It is intended to connect it with an\r\nelectrical railway from Dervock, for which Parliamentary powers have\r\nalready been obtained, thus completing the connection with the narrow\r\ngauge system from Ballymena to Larne and Cushendall. About 1,500 yards\r\nfrom the end of the line, there is a waterfall on the river Bush, with\r\nan available head of 24 feet, and an abundant supply of water at all\r\nseasons of the year. Turbines are now being erected, and the necessary\r\nworks executed for employing the fall for working the generating\r\ndynamo machines, and the current will be conveyed by means of an\r\nunderground cable to the end of the line. Of the application of the\r\nwater power it is unnecessary to speak further, as the works are not\r\nyet completed. For the present, the line is worked by a small\r\nsteam-engine placed at the carriage depot at the Portrush end. The\r\nwhole of the constructive works have been designed and carried out by\r\nMr. Traill, assisted by Mr. E.B. Price.\r\n\r\nThe system employed may be described as that of the separate\r\nconductor. A rail of T-iron, weighing 19 pounds to the yard, is\r\ncarried on wooden posts, boiled in pitch, and placed ten feet apart,\r\nat a distance of 22 inches from the inside rail and 17 inches above\r\nthe ground. This rail comes close up against the fence on the side of\r\nthe road, thus forming an additional protection. The conductor is\r\nconnected by an underground cable to a single shunt-wound dynamo\r\nmachine, placed in the engine shed, and worked by a small agricultural\r\nsteam engine of about 25 indicated horse power. The current is\r\nconveyed from the conductor by means of two springs, made of steel,\r\nrigidly held by two steel bars placed one at each end of the car, and\r\nprojecting about six inches from the side. Since the conducting rail\r\nis iron, while the brushes are steel, the wear of the latter is\r\nexceedingly small. In dry weather they require the rail to be slightly\r\nlubricated; in wet weather the water on the surface of the iron\r\nprovides all the lubrication required. The double brushes, placed at\r\nthe extremities of the car, enable it to bridge over the numerous\r\ngaps, which necessarily interrupt the conductor to allow cart ways\r\ninto the fields and commons adjoining the shore. On the diagram the\r\ncar is shown passing one of these gaps: the front brush has broken\r\ncontact, but since the back brush is still touching the rail, the\r\ncurrent has not been broken. Before the back brush leaves the\r\nconductor, the front brush will have again risen upon it, so that the\r\ncurrent is never interrupted. There are two or three gaps too broad to\r\nbe bridged in this way. In these cases the driver will break the\r\ncurrent before reaching the gap, the momentum of the car carrying it\r\nthe 10 or 12 yards it must travel without power.\r\n\r\nThe current is conveyed under the gaps by means of an insulated copper\r\ncable carried in wrought-iron pipes, placed at a depth of 18 inches.\r\nAt the passing places, which are situated on inclines, the conductor\r\ntakes the inside, and the car ascending the hill also runs on the\r\ninside, while the car descending the hill proceeds by gravity on the\r\noutside lines.\r\n\r\nFrom the brushes the current is taken to a commutator worked by a\r\nlever, which switches resistance frames placed under the car, in or\r\nout, as may be desired. The same lever alters the position of the\r\nbrushes on the commutator of the dynamo machine, reversing the\r\ndirection of rotation, in the manner shown by the electrical hoist.\r\nThe current is not, as it were, turned full on suddenly, but passes\r\nthrough the resistances, which are afterward cut out in part or\r\naltogether, according as the driver desires to run at part speed or\r\nfull speed.\r\n\r\nFrom the dynamo the current is conveyed through the axle boxes to the\r\naxles, thence to the tires of the wheels, and finally back by the\r\nrails, which are uninsulated, to the generating machine. The conductor\r\nis laid in lengths of about 21 feet, the lengths being connected by\r\nfish plates and also by a double copper loop securely soldered to the\r\niron. It is also necessary that the rails of the permanent way should\r\nbe connected in a similar manner, as the ordinary fish plates give a\r\nvery uncertain electrical contact, and the earth for large currents is\r\naltogether untrustworthy as a conductor, though no doubt materially\r\nreducing the total resistance of the circuit.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo is placed in the center of the car, beneath the floor, and\r\nthrough intermediate spur gear drives by a steel chain on to one axle\r\nonly. The reversing levers, and also the levers working the mechanical\r\nbrakes, are connected to both ends of the car, so that the driver can\r\nalways stand at the front and have uninterrupted view of the rails,\r\nwhich is of course essential in the case of a line laid by the side of\r\nthe public road.\r\n\r\nThe cars are first and third class, some open and some covered, and\r\nare constructed to hold twenty people, exclusive of the driver. At\r\npresent, only one is fitted with a dynamo, but four more machines are\r\nnow being constructed by Messrs. Siemens Bros., so that before the\r\nbeginning of the heavy summer traffic five cars will be ready; and\r\nsince two of these will be fitted with machines capable of drawing a\r\nsecond car, there will be an available rolling stock of seven cars. It\r\nis not intended at present to work electrically the portion of the\r\nline in the town at Portrush, though this will probably be done\r\nhereafter; and a portion, at least, of the mineral traffic will be\r\nleft for the two steam-tramway engines which were obtained for the\r\ntemporary working of the line pending the completion of the electrical\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nLet us now put in a form suitable for calculation the principles with\r\nwhich Mr. Siemens has illustrated in a graphic form more convenient\r\nfor the purposes of explanation, and then show how these principles\r\nhave been applied in the present case.\r\n\r\nLet L be the couple, measured in foot-pounds, which the dynamo must\r\nexert in order to drive the car, and _w_ the necessary angular\r\nvelocity. Taking the tare of the car as 50 cwt., including the weight\r\nof the machinery it carries, and a load of twenty people as 30 cwt.,\r\nwe have a gross weight of 4 tons. Assume that the maximum required is\r\nthat the car should carry this load at a speed of seven miles an hour,\r\non an incline of 1 in 40. The resistance due to gravity may be taken\r\nas 56 lb. per ton, and the frictional resistance and that due to other\r\ncauses, say, 14 lb. per ton, giving a total resistance of 280 lb., at\r\na radius of 14 inches. The angular velocity of the axle corresponding\r\nto a speed of seven miles an hour, is 84 revolutions per minute. Hence\r\nL = 327 foot pounds, and _w_ = (2[pi] × 84) / 60.\r\n\r\nIf the dynamo be wound directly on the axle, it must be designed to\r\nexert the couple, L, corresponding to the maximum load, when revolving\r\nat an angular velocity, w, the difference of potential between the\r\nterminals being the available E.M.F. of the conductor, and the current\r\nthe maximum the armature will safely stand. This will be the case in\r\nthe Charing-cross Electrical Railway. But when the dynamo is connected\r\nby intermediate gear to the driving wheels only, the product of L and\r\n_w_ remains constant, and the two factors may be varied. In the\r\npresent case L is diminished in the ratio of 7 to 1, and _w_\r\nconsequently increased in the same ratio. Hence the dynamo, with its\r\nmaximum load, must revolve at 588 revolutions per minute, and exert a\r\ncouple of forty-seven foot-pounds. Let E be the potential of the\r\nconductor from which the current is drawn, measured in volts, C the\r\ncurrent in amperes, and E1 the E.M.F. of the dynamo. Then E1 is\r\nproportional to the product of the angular velocity, and a certain\r\nfunction of the current. For a velocity [omega], let this function be\r\ndenoted by _f_(C). If the characteristic of the dynamo can be drawn,\r\nthen _f_(C) is known.\r\n\r\nWe have then\r\n\r\n                w\r\n       E1 = -------- f\r\n             [Omega]                            (1.)\r\n\r\nIf R be the resistance in circuit by Ohm's law,\r\n\r\n          E - E1\r\n     C = --------\r\n             R\r\n\r\n               w\r\n       = E  ------- f(C)\r\n            [Omega]\r\n        ----------------\r\n                R\r\n\r\nand therefore\r\n\r\n         [Omega](E - CR)                        (2.)\r\n     w = -----------------\r\n              f(C)\r\n\r\nLet _a_ be the efficiency with which the motor transforms electrical\r\ninto mechanical energy, then--\r\n\r\n     Power required = L w = a E1 C\r\n\r\n                            w\r\n                   = a C ------- f(C)\r\n                         [Omega]\r\n\r\nDividing by _w_,\r\n\r\n           a C f(C)\r\n      L = -------- .                            (3.)\r\n           [Omega]\r\n\r\nIt must be noted that L is here measured in electrical measure, or,\r\nadopting the unit given by Dr. Siemens in the British Association\r\nAddress, in joules. One joule equals approximately 0.74 foot pound.\r\nEquation 3 gives at once an analytical proof of the second principle\r\nstated above, that for a given motor the current depends upon the\r\ncouple, and upon it alone. Equation 2 shows that with a given load the\r\nspeed depends upon E, the electromotive force of the main, and R the\r\nresistance in circuit. It shows also the effect of putting into the\r\ncircuit the resistance frames placed beneath the car. If R be\r\nincreased, until CR is equal to E, then _w_ vanishes, and the car\r\nremains at rest. If R be still further increased, Ohm's law applies,\r\nand the current diminishes. Hence suitable resistances are, first, a\r\nhigh resistance for diminishing the current, and consequently, the\r\nsparking at making and breaking of of the circuit; and, secondly, one\r\nor more low resistances for varying the speed of the car. If the form\r\nof _f_(C) be known, as is the case with a Siemens machine, equations 2\r\nand 3 can be completely solved for _w_ and C, giving the current and\r\nspeed in terms of L, E, and R. The expressions so obtained are not\r\nwithout interest, and agree with the results of experiment.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed that an arc light presents the converse case to a\r\nmotor. The E.M.F. of the arc is approximately constant, whatever the\r\nintensity of the current passing between the carbons; and the current\r\ndepends entirely on the resistance in circuit. Hence the instability\r\nof an arc produced by machines of low internal resistance, unless\r\ncompensated by considerable resistance in the leads.\r\n\r\nThe following experiment shows in a striking form the principles just\r\nconsidered: An Edison lamp is placed in parallel circuit with a small\r\ndynamo machine, used as a motor. The Prony brake on the pulley of the\r\ndynamo is quite slack, allowing it to revolve freely. Now let the lamp\r\nand dynamo be coupled to the generator running at full speed. First,\r\nthe lamp glows, in a moment it again becomes dark, then, as the dynamo\r\ngets up speed, glows again. If the brake be screwed up tight, the lamp\r\nonce more becomes dark. The explanation is simple. Owing to the\r\ncoefficient of self-induction of the dynamo machine being\r\nconsiderable, it takes a finite time for the current to obtain an\r\nappreciable intensity, but the lamp having no self-induction, the\r\ncurrent at once passes through it, and causes it to glow. Secondly,\r\nthe electrical inertia of the dynamo being overcome, it must draw a\r\nlarge current to produce the kinetic energy of rotation, i.e., to\r\novercome its mechanical inertia; the lamp is therefore practically\r\nshort-circuited, and ceases to glow. When once the rotation has been\r\nestablished, the current through the dynamo becomes very small, having\r\nno work to do except to overcome the friction of the bearings, hence\r\nthe lamp again glows. Finally, by screwing up the brake, the current\r\nthrough the dynamo is increased, and the lamp again short-circuited.\r\n\r\nIt has often been pointed out that reversal of the motor on the car\r\nwould be a most effective brake. This is certainly true; but, at the\r\nsame time, it is a brake that should not be used except in cases of\r\nemergency. For this reason, the dynamo revolving at a high speed, the\r\nmomentum of the current is very considerable; hence, owing to the\r\nself-induction of the machine, a sudden reversal will tend to break\r\ndown the insulation at any weak point of the machine. The action is\r\nanalogous to the spark produced by a Ruhmkorff coil. This was\r\nillustrated at Portrush; when the car was running perhaps fifteen\r\nmiles an hour, the current was suddenly reversed. The car came to a\r\nstandstill in little more than its own length, but at the expense of\r\nbreaking down the insulation of one of the wires of the magnet coils.\r\nThe way out of the difficulty is evidently at the moment of reversal\r\nto insert a high resistance to diminish the momentum of the current.\r\n\r\nIn determining the proper dimensions of a conductor for railway\r\npurposes, Sir William Thomson's law should properly apply. But on a\r\nline where the gradients and traffic are very irregular, it is\r\ndifficult to estimate the average current, and the desirability of\r\nhaving the rail mechanically strong, and of such low resistance that\r\nthe potential shall not vary very materially throughout its length,\r\nbecomes more important than the economic considerations involved in\r\nSir William Thomson's law. At Portrush the resistance of a mile,\r\nincluding the return by earth and the ground rails, is actually about\r\n0.23 ohm. If calculated from the section of the iron, it would be 0.15\r\nohm, the difference being accounted for by the resistance of the\r\ncopper loops, and occasional imperfect contacts. The E.M.F. at which\r\nthe conductor is maintained is about 225 volts, which is well within\r\nthe limit of perfect safety assigned by Sir William Thomson and Dr.\r\nSiemens. At the same time the shock received by touching the iron is\r\nsufficient to be unpleasant, and hence is some protection against the\r\nconductor being tampered with.\r\n\r\nConsider a car requiring a given constant current; evidently the\r\nmaximum loss due to resistance will occur when the car is at the\r\nmiddle point of the line, and will then be one-fourth of the total\r\nresistance of the line, provided the two extremities are maintained by\r\nthe generators at the same potential. Again, by integration, the mean\r\nresistance can be shown to be one-sixth of the resistance of the line.\r\nApplying these figures, and assuming four cars are running, requiring\r\n4 horse power each, the loss due to resistance does not exceed 4 per\r\ncent. of the power developed on the cars; or if one car only be\r\nrunning, the loss is less than 1 per cent. But in actual practice at\r\nPortrush even these estimates are too high, as the generators are\r\nplaced at the bottom of the hills, and the middle portion of the line\r\nis more or less level, hence the minimum current is required when the\r\nresistance is at its maximum value.\r\n\r\nThe insulation of the conductor has been a matter of considerable\r\ndifficulty, chiefly on account of the moistness of the climate. An\r\ninsulation has now, however, been obtained of from 500 to 1,000 ohms\r\nper mile, according to the state of the weather, by placing a cap of\r\ninsulite between the wooden posts and T-iron. Hence the total leakage\r\ncannot exceed 2.5 amperes, representing a loss of three-fourths of a\r\nhorse power, or under 5 per cent, when four cars are running. But\r\napart from these figures, we have materials for an actual comparison\r\nof the cost of working the line by electricity and steam. The steam\r\ntramway engines, temporarily employed at Portrush, are made by Messrs.\r\nWilkinson, of Wigan, and are generally considered as satisfactory as\r\nany of the various tramway engines. They have a pair of vertical\r\ncylinders, 8 inches diameter and one foot stroke, and work at a boiler\r\npressure of 120 lb., the total weight of the engine being 7 tons. The\r\nelectrical car with which the comparison is made has a dynamo weighing\r\n13 cwt., and the tare of the car is 52 cwt. The steam-engines are\r\ncapable of drawing a total load of about 12 tons up the hill,\r\nexcluding the weight of the engine; the dynamo over six tons,\r\nincluding its own weight; hence, weight for weight, the dynamo will\r\ndraw five times as much as the steam-engine. Finally, compare the\r\nfollowing estimates of cost. From actual experience, the steam-engine,\r\ntaking an average over a week, costs--\r\n\r\n                                          £  s. d.\r\n  Driver's wages.                         1 10  0\r\n  Cleaner's  \"                            0 12  0\r\n  Coke, 58½ cwt. at 25s. per ton.         3 13  1½\r\n  Oil, 1 gallon at 3s. 1d.                0  3  1\r\n  Tallow, 4 lb. at 6d.                    0  2  0\r\n  Waste, 8 lb. at 2d.                     0  1  4\r\n  Depreciation, 15 per cent. on £750.     2  3  3\r\n                                        ----------\r\n                           Total.        £8  4  9½\r\n\r\nThe distance run was 312 miles.

Heavier traffic will tell very much in favor of the\r\nelectric car, as the loss due to leakage will be a much smaller\r\nproportion of the total power developed.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the cost of the tramway engines is very much\r\nin excess of what is usual on other lines, but this is entirely\r\naccounted for by the high price of coke, and the exceedingly difficult\r\nnature of the line to work, on account of the curves and gradients.\r\nThese causes send up the cost of electrical working in the same ratio,\r\nhence the comparison is valid as between the steam and electricity,\r\nbut it would be unsafe to compare the cost of either with\r\nhorse-traction or wire-rope traction on other lines. The same fuel was\r\nburnt in the stationary steam-engine and in the tramway engines, and\r\nthe same rolling stock used in both cases; but, otherwise, the\r\ncomparison was made under circumstances in favor of the tramway\r\nengine, as the stationary steam-engine is by no means economical,\r\nconsuming at least 5 lb. of coke per horse-power hour, and the\r\nexperiments were made, in the case of the electrical car, over a\r\nlength of line three miles long, which included the worst hills and\r\ncurves, and one-half of the conductor was not provided with the\r\ninsulite caps, the leakage consequently being considerably larger than\r\nit will be eventually.\r\n\r\nFinally, as regards the speed of the electrical car, it is capable of\r\nrunning on the level at the rate of 12 miles per hour, but as the line\r\nis technically a tramway, the Board of Trade Regulations do not allow\r\nthe speed to exceed 10 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nTaking these data as to cost, and remembering how this will be reduced\r\nwhen the water power is made available, and remembering such\r\nconsiderations as the freedom from smoke and steam, the diminished\r\nwear and tear of the permanent way, and the advantage of having each\r\ncar independent, it may be said that there is a future for electrical\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nWe must not conclude without expressing our best thanks to Messrs.\r\nSiemens Bros. for having kindly placed all this apparatus at our\r\ndisposal to-night, and allowing us to publish the results of\r\nexperiments made at their works.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THOMSON-HOUSTON ELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe generator is known as the \"Thomson spherical,\" on account of the\r\nnearly spherical form of its armature, and differs radically from all\r\nothers in all essential portions, viz., its field magnets, armature,\r\nand winding thereof, and in its commutator; both in principle and\r\nconstruction, and, besides, it is provided with an automatic\r\nregulator, an attachment not applied to other generators. The annexed\r\nview of the complete machine will convey an idea of the general\r\nappearance and disposition of its parts.\r\n\r\nThe revolving armature which generates the electrical current is made\r\ninternally of a hollow shell of soft iron secured to the central\r\nportion of the shaft between the bearings, and is wound externally\r\nwith a copper conducting wire, constituting three coils or helices\r\nsurrounding the armature, which coils are, however, permanently\r\njoined, and in reality act as a single three-branched wire.\r\n\r\nThis wire, being wound on the exterior of the armature, is fully\r\nexposed to the powerful magnetic influence of the field poles, which\r\ninclose the armature almost completely. The armature will thus be seen\r\nto be thoroughly incased and protected, at the same time that all the\r\nwire upon it is subject to a powerful action of the surrounding\r\nmagnets, resulting in an economy in the generation of current in its\r\ncoils. The form of the armature being spherical, very little power is\r\nlost by air friction, and no injury can occur from increased speed\r\ndeveloping centrifugal force. The field magnets, which surround the\r\narmature, are cast iron shells, wound outside with many convolutions\r\nof insulated copper wire, and are joined externally by iron bars to\r\nconvey the magnetism. These outer bars serve also as a most efficient\r\nprotection to the wire and armature of the machine during\r\ntransportation or otherwise. Objects cannot fall upon or rest upon the\r\nwire coils and injure them. The coils of wire upon the field magnets\r\nsurround not only the iron poles or shells, but are situated also so\r\nas to surround likewise the revolving armature, and increase the\r\neffect produced in it by direct induction and magnetism. This feature\r\nis not used in any other generator, nor does any other make use of a\r\nspherical armature. The shaft is mounted in babbitted bearings of\r\nample size, sustained by a handsome frame therefor, and is of steel,\r\nfinely turned and perfectly true. The shaft and armature together are\r\nbalanced with the utmost care, and run without buzz or rumble. The\r\narmature wire is kept cool by an active circulation of air over its\r\nwhole surface during revolution. The commutator, or portion from which\r\nthe currents developed in the armature are carried out for use, is a\r\nbeautiful piece of mechanism. It is mounted upon the end of the shaft,\r\nand has attached to it the wires, three only, coming from the armature\r\nwire through the tubular shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THOMSON SPHERICAL.]\r\n\r\nThe commutator is peculiar, consisting of only three segments of a\r\ncopper ring, while in the simplest of other continuous current\r\ngenerators several times that number exist, and frequently 120!\r\nsegments are to be found. These three segments are made so as to be\r\nremovable in a moment for cleaning or replacement. They are mounted\r\nupon a metal support, and are surrounded on all sides by a free air\r\nspace, and cannot, therefore, lose their insulated condition. This\r\nfeature of air insulation is peculiar to this system, and is very\r\nimportant as a factor in the durability of the commutator. Besides\r\nthis, the commutator is sustained by supports carried in flanges upon\r\nthe shaft, which flanges, as an additional safeguard, are coated all\r\nover with hard rubber, one of the finest known insulators. It may be\r\nstated, without fear of contradiction, that no other commutator made\r\nis so thoroughly insulated and protected. The three commutator\r\nsegments virtually constitute a single copper ring, mounted in free\r\nair, and cut into three equal pieces by slots across its face. Four\r\nslit copper springs, called commutator brushes or collectors, are\r\nallowed to bear lightly upon the commutator when it revolves, and\r\nserve to take up the current and convey it to the circuit. These\r\ncommutator brushes are carried by movable supports, and their position\r\nis automatically regulated so as to control the strength of the\r\ndeveloped current--a feature not found in other systems. This feature,\r\nas well as the fact that the commutator can be oiled to prevent wear,\r\nsaves attendance and greatly increases the durability of the wearing\r\nsurfaces, while the commutator brushes are maintained in the position\r\nof best adjustment. The commutator and brushes, in consequence, after\r\nweeks of running, show scarcely any wear.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTOMATIC CURRENT REGULATOR.\r\n\r\nThis consists of a peculiar magnet attached to the frame of the\r\ngenerator, and the movable armature of which has connections to the\r\nsupports of the commutator brushes for controlling their position. The\r\nregulator magnet is so formed as to give a uniform attraction upon\r\nits armature in different positions. In Thomson's improved form this\r\nis accomplished in a novel manner by making the pole of the magnet\r\nparaboloidal in form, and making an opening in the movable armature to\r\nencircle said pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CURRENT REGULATOR]\r\n\r\nThe armature is hung on pivots so as to be free to move only toward\r\nand from the regulating magnet on changes in the current traversing\r\nthe latter, and being connected to the commutator brushes,\r\nautomatically adjusts their position. By this means the power of the\r\ngenerator is adapted to run any number of lights within its limit of\r\ncapacity, or may be short circuited purposely or by accident without\r\ndifficulty arising therefrom; and a number of instances have occurred\r\nwhere the injurious effects of a short circuit accidentally formed\r\nhave been entirely obviated by the presence of the regulator. In one\r\ninstance four generators, in series representing over forty lights'\r\ncapacity, were accidentally short circuited, and no injury or even\r\nnoticeable action took place except a quick movement of the regulators\r\nin adapting themselves to the new conditions. Had this accident\r\noccurred to generators unprovided with regulators, great injury or\r\npossible destruction of the apparatus would have resulted. It is\r\nimportant to a full understanding of the regulation, to state that its\r\naction is independent of resistances introduced, that it saves power\r\nand carbons in proportion to lights extinguished, and that it\r\ncompensates for speed variations above the minimum speed. The manner\r\nof its action is to control the generation of current at the source in\r\nthe armature, and it does so by combining certain electrical actions\r\nso as to obtain a differential effect, such that when small force of\r\ncurrent only is required it alone is furnished, and when the maximum\r\nforce is needed the same shall be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CONTROLLER MAGNET.]\r\n\r\nOn the larger generators we combine with the regulator magnet above\r\ndescribed an exceedingly sensitive controller magnet governing the\r\nregulation, and by whose accuracy the smallest variations of current\r\nare counteracted, and the operation of the generator rendered perfect.\r\nThe controller magnet is contained in a box placed on the wall or\r\nother support near the generator, and consists of a delicate double\r\naxial magnet controlling the admission of current to the regulator,\r\nupon the generator, and its action is exceedingly simple and\r\neffective. So perfect is the action that in a circuit of twenty-five\r\nto thirty lights, lights may be removed or put out in rapid succession\r\nwithout apparently affecting those that remain. Besides, we have been\r\nenabled to put out even eight or ten lights together instantly, while\r\nthe remainder burn as before. The features above set forth are\r\npeculiar to the Thomson-Houston system, and have been thoroughly\r\ncovered by patents, and cannot therefore be adopted into other\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THOMSON ARC LAMP.\r\n\r\nThis lamp is essentially a series lamp; that is, any number of them\r\ncan be put on one circuit wire, but a single lamp, used alone, burns\r\nequally well. It consists of a metal frame supporting at the bottom\r\nthe holder for the globe and lower carbon, which is insulated from the\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nThe annexed figure of the plain lamp will convey an understanding of\r\nits general appearance. The upper carbon is fed downward by the\r\nmechanism contained in the box above, and is carried by a vertical\r\nround rod called the carbon holding rod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THOMSON ARC LAMP.]\r\n\r\nIn the regulating box of the lamp there exists a simple mechanism, the\r\nresult of careful study and experiment to discover the best and\r\nsimplest combination of appliances, which would obviate the necessity\r\nfor the use of clockwork or dash-pots, from which fluids might be\r\naccidentally spilled, for obtaining a gradual feeding of the carbon as\r\nfast as it is consumed in producing the light, and at the same time to\r\nmaintain the arc or space between the carbons in burning, of such\r\nextent as to give a steady, noiseless light, of greatest possible\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe lamp, once adjusted, does not require any readjustment, and, in\r\nfact, is built in such a manner as to avoid the presence of adjusting\r\ndevices in it. The lamp also contains an automatic safety device for\r\npreserving the continuity of the circuit in case of accidental injury\r\nto the feeding mechanism or the carbons of the lamps. This is quite\r\nimportant when a considerable number of lights are operated upon one\r\ncircuit wire, as a break in the circuit, due to a defective lamp,\r\nwould result in the extinguishment of all the lights. With the safety\r\ndevice mentioned, such a break does not occur, but the flow of current\r\nis preserved through the faulty lamp.\r\n\r\nBy an exceedingly simple device upon the carbon holding rod, the lamps\r\nare extinguished when the carbons are burned out, and injury by\r\nburning the holders completely avoided.\r\n\r\nThe system is based upon the joint inventions of Elihu Thomson and\r\nEdwin J. Houston, for generators, regulators, and electric lamps, and\r\nalso the patents of Elihu Thomson, in generators, regulators, and\r\nelectric lamps; all of which are now operated and controlled by the\r\nThomson-Houston Electric Co., 131 Devonshire Street, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MODIFICATION OF THE VIBRATING BELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the causes which gives rise to induction in the telephone lines\r\nrunning along the Belgian railroads is that there are so many electric\r\nbells in the stations.\r\n\r\nMr. Lippens proposes as a remedy for the trouble a slight modification\r\nof the vibrating bell of his invention so as to exclude from the line\r\nthe extra currents from the bell.\r\n\r\nIn one of the styles (Fig. 1) a spring, R, is attached at T to a fixed\r\nmetallic rod, and presses against the rod, T¹. The current enters\r\nthrough the terminal, B, traverses the bobbins, passes through T,\r\nthrough the spring, through T¹, and makes its exit through the other\r\nterminal. The armature is attracted, and the point, P, fixed thereto\r\ndraws back the spring from the rod, T¹, and interrupts the current;\r\nbut, at the moment at which the point touches the spring, and before\r\nthe latter has been detached from the rod, T¹, the electro-magnet\r\nbecomes included in a short circuit, and the line current, instead of\r\npassing through the bobbins for a very short time, passes through the\r\nwire, T, the armature, and the rod, T¹, so that the extra current is\r\nno longer sent into the line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nIn another style (Fig. 2) the current is not interrupted at all, but\r\nenters through the terminal, B, traverses the bobbins, and goes\r\nthrough C to the terminal, B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the armature is attracted, the spring, R, which is fixed to\r\nit presses against the fixed metallic rod, T, and thus gives the\r\nelectricity a shorter travel than it would take by preference. The\r\ncurrent ceases, then, to pass through the bobbins, demagnetization\r\noccurs, and the spring that holds the armature separates anew. The\r\ncurrent now passes for a second time into the bobbins and produces a\r\nnew action, and so on. There is no longer, then, any interruption of\r\nthe current, and the motions of the hammer are brought about by the\r\nchange in direction of the current, which alternately traverses and\r\nleaves the bobbins.\r\n\r\nIn a communication that he has addressed to us on the subject of these\r\nbells, Mr. Lippens adds a few details in regard to the mode of\r\napplying the ground pile to micro-telephone stations.\r\n\r\nBeing given any two stations, he puts into the ground at the first a\r\ncopper plate, and at the second a zinc one, and connects the two by a\r\nline wire provided with two vibrating bells and two telephone\r\napparatus. The earth current suffices to actuate the bells, but, in\r\norder to effect a call, the inventor is obliged to run them\r\ncontinuously and to interrupt them at the moment at which he wishes to\r\ncommunicate. The correspondent is then notified through the cessation\r\nof noise in the bells, and the two call-apparatus are thrown out of\r\nthe circuit by the play of the commutator, and are replaced by the\r\nmicro-telephone apparatus.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly impracticable to allow vibrating bells to ring\r\ncontinuously in this manner. The ground pile would, at the most, be\r\nonly admissible in cases where the call, having to be made from only\r\none of the stations, might be effected by a closing of the\r\ncircuit.--_La Lumiere Electrique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advantage of lighting vessels by electricity was shown when the\r\nsteamer Carolina, of the old Bay Line between Baltimore and Norfolk,\r\nran into the British steamship Riversdale in a dense fog off Cedar\r\nPoint, on Chesapeake Bay.

The numbers are supposed to be read after\r\nfixation, the plate being held against the sky.\r\n\r\nSchumann's statement that a gelatino bromide plate is less sensitive\r\nwhen developed at 30° C. than when developed at 5°, is contested; the\r\nmore recent investigations of Dr. Eder serving to demonstrate that a\r\ndeveloper at a moderate high temperature acts very much more rapidly\r\nthan when the temperature is low; but when a sufficient time is\r\nallowed for each developer to thoroughly penetrate the film, the\r\ndifference becomes less apparent.

The fixed and washed plate is put in a bath of bromide\r\nof copper (ten per cent. solution); the film whitens immediately, and\r\nwhen the color is even all over, the plate is taken out and plunged\r\ninto a bath of the ordinary ferrous oxalate developer. It takes a dark\r\nolive tint, which is very non-actinic, the shadows meanwhile remaining\r\nvery clear.--_Photo.

I only\r\nmade one batch of plates at the time, which possessed several\r\nimportant features I considered an advantage, and I think well worth\r\nwhile following out. I do not think it can be denied that ordinary\r\ngelatine plates, if exposed in a weak light, fall very short of the\r\nresults obtained with wet collodion when compared side by side,\r\ngelatine being almost useless under these conditions, and there is a\r\ndecided gain in the result in this respect if the emulsion be made\r\nwith zinc bromide.\r\n\r\nIn using bromide of zinc there is a slight difficulty to overcome, but\r\nit _can_ be overcome, as I have succeeded in making a perfect\r\nemulsion. It will, I have no doubt, be remembered that Mr. L. Warnerke\r\nwas the first to call attention to this salt in the days of collodion\r\nemulsion; and I think he claimed for an emulsion prepared with it that\r\nthe image would stand more forcing without fogging to gain any amount\r\nof intensity. This was said of a collodion emulsion, and I also find\r\nthat it is the same when used in a gelatine emulsion. I have heard a\r\ngreat many say, when speaking about the intensity of gelatine plates,\r\nthat they can get any amount of intensity. I grant that in a studio\r\nwhere the operator has full command over the lighting of his subject\r\nby means of blinds, but it is not so in the field, especially when the\r\nlight is dull. I have seen thousands of negatives, and as a rule I\r\nhave found want of intensity has been the fault, and generally through\r\nthe light. Now if we can find a remedy for this, it will be a step in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nWhat I claim for bromide of zinc is that a rapid plate can be made\r\nwith it, and any degree of intensity can be readily obtained with a\r\nvery small proportion of pyrogallic acid in the developer. The cry as\r\nalways is to use plenty of pyrogallic acid and you can get any amount\r\nof intensity. I remember, in the early days of gelatine, as much as\r\nsix grains being recommended, and I have myself, under extraordinary\r\ncircumstances, used as much as ten grains to the ounce; but I think it\r\nis now, to a certain extent, a thing of the past. With the plates to\r\nwhich I refer, I found that I only required to use for a 7½ × 5 plate\r\none grain of pyrogallic acid in about three ounces of developer to get\r\nfull density without the slightest difficulty. If the ordinary\r\nquantity were used far too much density was obtained, and the plate\r\nruined beyond recovery; but with so small a quantity of pyro. the\r\nplate was not so much stained as with a larger quantity, and the\r\nnegative took far less time to develop on account of the intensity\r\nbeing so readily obtained.\r\n\r\nIn making a gelatine emulsion with zinc it must be _decidedly acid_ or\r\nit fogs. I prefer nitric acid for the purpose. I also found that some\r\nsamples of the bromide behaved in a very peculiar way. All went on\r\nwell until it came to the washing, when the bromide of silver washed\r\nout slowly, rendering the washing water slightly milky; this continued\r\nuntil the whole of the bromide of silver was discharged from the\r\ngelatine, and the latter rendered perfectly transparent as in the\r\nfirst instance. I remember a gentleman mentioning at one of the\r\nmeetings of the South London Photographic Society that he was troubled\r\nin the same way as I was at that time. I think if a few experiments\r\nwere made in this direction with the zinc salt and worked out, it\r\nwould be a great advantage.--_Wm. Brooks, in Br.

It is\r\nproposed to face the external walls with red Suffolk bricks and\r\nCorsham Down stone dressings, the chimneys to be finished with moulded\r\nbricks. The attic gables, etc., would be half-timbered in oak, and the\r\nroof covered with red Fareham tiles laid on felt. Internally, the hall\r\nand corridors are to be laid with tiles; the wood finishing on ground\r\nfloor to be of walnut, and on first floor of pitch pine. The ground\r\nfloor contains drawing-room, 23 ft. by 16 ft., with octagonal recess\r\nin angle (which also forms a feature in the elevation), and door\r\nleading to conservatory. The morning-room, 16 ft. by 16 ft., also\r\nleads into conservatory. Dining-room, 20 ft. by 16 ft., with serving\r\ndoor leading from kitchen. The hall and principal staircase are\r\nconveniently situated in the main part of the house, with doors\r\nleading to the several rooms, and entrances to garden. The domestic\r\noffices, though conveniently placed, are entirely cut off from the\r\nmain portion of the house by a door leading from the hall. In the\r\nbasement there is ample cellar accommodation for wine or other\r\npurposes. The first floor contains four bed-rooms, two dressing-rooms,\r\nbath-room, w.c., etc. The attic floor, reached by the servants'\r\nstaircase, contains two servants' bed-rooms, day and night nurseries,\r\nand box and store rooms. The estimated cost is £3,800. The design is\r\nby Mr. Charles C.

He belongs to an ancient Scottish family, many\r\nmembers of which have risen to distinction in Scotland and also in the\r\nNew World.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 he took a first class in mathematics, and he afterward won the\r\njunior (1846) and the senior (1847) university mathematical\r\nscholarships. He returned to Oxford for a term or two, and gave a\r\ncourse of lectures in Balliol College on Geometry of Three\r\nDimensions--a favorite subject of his. He was examiner in the\r\nmathematical schools in 1857-58. On leaving Oxford, he immediately, we\r\nbelieve, took an active part in the working management of the business\r\nof the Queen's printers, about this time resigned to him by his\r\nfather, Andrew Spottiswoode, brother of the Laird of Spottiswoode. The\r\nbusiness has largely developed under his hands.\r\n\r\nOther subjects than mathematics have occupied his attention: at an\r\nearly age he studied languages, as well Oriental as European.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM SPOTTISWOODE.]\r\n\r\nAs treasurer and president, he has been continuously on the Council\r\nof the Royal Society for a great many years, and through his\r\nexceptional gifts as an administrator he has rendered it invaluable\r\nservices. He has rendered similar services to the British Association,\r\nto the London Mathematical Society, and to the Royal Institution. We\r\nhave permission to make the following extract from a letter written by\r\na friend of many years' standing: \"In the councils (of the various\r\nsocieties) he has always been distinguished by his sound judgment and\r\nhis deep sympathy with their purest and highest aims. There never was\r\na trace of partisanship in his action, or of narrowness in his\r\nsympathies. On the contrary, every one engaged in thoroughly\r\nscientific work has felt that he had a warm supporter in Spottiswoode,\r\non whose opportune aid he might surely count. The same breadth of\r\nsympathy and generosity of sentiment has marked also his relations to\r\nthose more entirely dependent upon him. The workmen in his large\r\nestablishment all feel that they have in him a true and trustworthy\r\nfriend. He has always identified himself with their educational and\r\nsocial well-being.\" We give here a list of some of the offices Mr.\r\nSpottiswoode has held, and of the honors that have been bestowed upon\r\nhim: Treasurer of the British Association from 1861 to 1874, of the\r\nRoyal Institution from 1865 to 1873, and of the Royal Society from\r\n1871 to 1878.

Bolton &\r\nWanklyn, and adapted by them, we understand, to the metallurgical\r\nbranches also.\r\n\r\nWhen bone ash or any other substance containing phosphate of lime is\r\ntreated with sulphuric acid, the products formed are superphosphate of\r\nlime and hydrated sulphate of lime; this mixture is known as\r\nsuperphosphate of lime, in commerce, and is the substance used in this\r\nprocess. This substance is capable of absorbing carbonic acid and\r\nammonia from foul gas. The complete action can only take place in the\r\npresence of a certain proportion of carbonic acid, so that the process\r\nis not so successful with \"well-scrubbed illuminating gas.\" The\r\nsuperphosphate is converted into carbonate of lime, while the ammonia\r\ncombines with the phosphoric acid to form phosphate of ammonia; the\r\nhydrated sulphate of lime is also acted upon, and forms carbonate of\r\nlime and sulphate of ammonia; so that, presuming the action to be\r\ncomplete, and the material to be thoroughly saturated with carbonic\r\nacid and ammonia from the foul gas, the result is a mixture of\r\ncarbonate of lime and phosphate and sulphate of ammonia.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the mixture absorbs one equivalent of\r\ncarbonic acid for every four equivalents of ammonia; therefore, if the\r\nsuperphosphate process be substituted for the ordinary washers and\r\nscrubbers, a large proportion of the carbonic acid and also the whole\r\nof the sulphureted hydrogen is left in the gas, and must be dealt with\r\nin other ways.\r\n\r\nThis superphosphate process has been at work at the South Metropolitan\r\nGas Works, Old Kent Road, for nearly two years. In practice it is\r\nusual to water the superphosphate before use with ammoniacal liquor,\r\nand it is used in dry purifiers, in layers about eight inches thick.\r\n\r\nThis process has been thoroughly investigated at the Munich Gas Works,\r\nby Drs. Bunte and Schilling, and the report made by these gentlemen\r\nproves its practical efficiency, and therefore the question of its\r\nadvantage, as compared with washing and scrubbing, is based chiefly\r\nupon financial considerations. It is evident that in foreign parts,\r\nor in any place where there is a difficulty in disposing of the\r\nammonia, the obtaining of the same in a dry form offers several\r\nadvantages as compared with having it as a weak solution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECONVERSION OF NITRO-GLYCERIN INTO GLYCERIN.\r\n\r\nBy C.L. BLOXAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following experiments on this subject appear to possess some\r\ninterest at the present moment:\r\n\r\n1. Nitro-glycerin was shaken with methylated alcohol, which dissolves\r\nit readily, and the solution was mixed with an alcoholic solution of\r\nKHS (prepared by dissolving KHO in methylated spirit, and saturating\r\nwith H_{2}S gas). Considerable rise of temperature took place, the\r\nliquid became red, a large quantity of sulphur separated, and the\r\nnitro-glycerin was entirely decomposed.\r\n\r\n2. Nitro-glycerin was shaken with a strong aqueous solution of\r\ncommercial K_{2}S. The same changes were observed as in 1, but the\r\nrise of temperature was not so great, and the liquid became opaque\r\nvery suddenly when the decomposition of the nitro-glycerin was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n3. The ordinary yellow solution of ammonium sulphide used in the\r\nlaboratory had the same effect as the K_{2}S. In this case the mixture\r\nwas evaporated to dryness on the steam bath, when bubbles of gas were\r\nevolved, due to the decomposition of the ammonium nitrite. The pasty\r\nmass of sulphur was treated with alcohol, which extracted the\r\nglycerin, subsequently recovered by evaporation. Another portion of\r\nthe mixture of nitro-glycerin with ammonium sulphide was treated with\r\nexcess of PbCO_{3} and a little lead acetate, filtered, and the ammonium\r\nnitrite detected in the solution. These qualitative results would be\r\nexpressed by the equation--\r\n\r\n       C3H5(NO)+3NH4HS = C3H5(OH)3 + 3NH4NO2 + S3,\r\n\r\nwhich is similar to that for the action of potassium hydrosulphide\r\nupon gun-cotton.\r\n\r\n4. Flowers of sulphur and slaked lime were boiled with water, till a\r\nbright orange solution was obtained. This was filtered, and some\r\nnitro-glycerin powered into it. The reduction took place much more\r\nslowly than in the other cases, and more agitation was required,\r\nbecause the nitro-glycerin became coated with sulphur. In a few\r\nminutes, the reduction appearing to be complete, the separated sulphur\r\nwas filtered off. The filtrate was clear, and the sulphur bore\r\nhammering without the slightest indication of nitro-glycerin.\r\n\r\nThis would be the cheapest method of decomposing nitro-glycerin.\r\nPerhaps the calcium sulphide of tank-waste, obtainable from the alkali\r\nworks, might answer the purpose.--_Chemical News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBONIC ACID AND BISULPHIDE OF CARBON.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A paper read before the Royal Society, April 5, 1883.]\r\n\r\nBy JOHN TYNDALL, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemists are ever on the alert to notice analogies and resemblances in\r\nthe atomic structure of different bodies. They long ago indicated\r\npoints of resemblance between bisulphide of carbon and carbonic acid.\r\nIn the case of the latter we have one atom of carbon united to two of\r\noxygen, and in the case of the former one atom of carbon united to two\r\nof sulphur. Attempts have been made to push the analogy still further\r\nby the discovery of a compound of carbon and sulphur analogous to\r\ncarbonic oxide, but hitherto, I believe, without success. I have now\r\nto note a resemblance of some interest to the physicist, and of a more\r\nsettled character than any hitherto observed.\r\n\r\nWhen, by means of an electric current, a metal is volatilized and\r\nsubjected to spectrum analysis, the \"reversal\" of the bright band of\r\nthe incandescent vapor is commonly observed. This is known to be due\r\nto the absorption of the rays emitted by the vapor by the partially\r\ncooled envelope of its own substance which surrounds it. The effect is\r\nthe same in kind as the absorption by cold carbonic acid of the heat\r\nemitted by a carbonic oxide flame. For most sources of radiation\r\ncarbonic acid is one of the most transparent of gases; for the\r\nradiation from the hot carbonic acid produced in the carbonic oxide\r\nflame it is the most opaque of all.\r\n\r\nAgain, for all ordinary sources of radiant heat, bisulphide of carbon,\r\nboth in the liquid and vaporous form, is one of the most diathermanous\r\nbodies ever known. I thought it worth while to try whether a body\r\nreputed to be analogous to carbonic acid, and so pervious to most\r\nkinds of heat, would show any change of deportment when presented to\r\nthe radiation from hot carbonic acid. Does the analogy between the two\r\nsubstances extend to the vibrating periods of their atoms? If it does,\r\nthen the bisulphide, like the carbonic acid, will abandon its usually\r\ntransparent character, and play the part of an opaque body when\r\npresented to the radiation from the carbonic oxide flame. This proved\r\nto be the case. Of the radiation from hydrogen, a thin layer of\r\nbisulphide transmits 90 per cent., absorbing only 10. For the\r\nradiation from carbonic acid, the same layer of bisulphide transmits\r\nonly 25 per cent., 75 per cent. being absorbed. For this source of\r\nrays, indeed, the bisulphide transcends, as an absorbent, many\r\nsubstances which, for all other sources, far transcend _it_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAIR, ITS USE AND ITS CARE.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Abstract of a paper read before the Pennsylvania State\r\nMedical Society, at Norristown, May 10, 1883.--_N.Y. Med. Jour._]\r\n\r\nBy JOHN V. SHOEMAKER, A.M., M.D., Physician to the Philadelphia\r\nHospital for Skin Diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this paper is to briefly describe the hair and its\r\nimportant functions, and to suggest the proper manner of preserving it\r\nin a healthy state.\r\n\r\nI know full well that much has been written upon this useful part of\r\nthe human economy, but the constant increase of bald heads and\r\nbeardless faces, notwithstanding all our modern advancement in the\r\napplication of remedies to the cure of disease, prompts me to point\r\nout to you the many ways of retaining, without medication, the hair,\r\nwhich is a defense, ornamentation, and adornment to the human body.\r\n\r\n[Dr. Shoemaker here gave an interesting history of the growth and\r\ndevelopment of the hair and its uses, which we are compelled to omit.\r\nThen, proceeding, he said:] Now, the hair, which fulfills such an\r\nimportant function in the adornment and health of the body, requires\r\nboth constitutional and local care to keep it in its normal, healthy\r\nstate. When I say constitutional care, I mean that the various organs\r\nof the body that assist in nourishing and sustaining the hair-forming\r\napparatus should, by judicious diet, exercise, and attention to the\r\nnervous system, be kept healthy and sound, in order that they in turn\r\nmay assist in preserving the hairs in a vigorous condition.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, that essential material, food, which is necessary\r\nto supply the waste and repair of all animal life, should be selected,\r\ngiven, or used according to good judgment and experience.\r\n\r\nThus, mothers should feed their infants at regular intervals according\r\nto their age, and not permit them to constantly pull at the breast or\r\nthe bottle until the little stomach becomes gorged with food, and some\r\nalimentary disorder supervenes, often setting up a rash and\r\ninterfering with the growth and development of the hair. It is\r\nlikewise important, in case the baby must be artificially fed, to\r\nselect good nutritious food as near as possible like the\r\nmother's--cow's milk, properly prepared, being the only recognized\r\nsubstitute. Care and discretion should likewise be taken by parents\r\nand nurses, after the infant has developed into childhood, to give\r\nsimple, substantial, and varied food at regular periods of the day,\r\nand not in such quantities as to overload the stomach. Children need\r\nactive nutrition to develop them into robust and healthy men and\r\nwomen; and it is from neglect of these important laws of health, and\r\nin allowing improper food, that very often bring their results in\r\nscald head, ring-worm, and scrofula, that leave their stamp in the\r\npoor development of the hair. With the advent of youth and the advance\r\nof years, food should be selected and partaken of according to the\r\njudgment and experience of its acceptable and wholesome action on the\r\nconsumer.\r\n\r\nThe meals should also be taken at regular intervals. At least four\r\nhours should be left between them for the act of digestion and the\r\nproper rest of the stomach.\r\n\r\nIt is, on the contrary, when the voice of nature has been stifled,\r\nwhen judgment and experience have been set aside, that mischief\r\nfollows; when the stomach is teased and fretted with overloading, and\r\nthe food gulped down without being masticated, gastric and intestinal\r\nderangement supervenes, which is one of the most prolific sources of\r\nthe early decay and fall of the hair.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system, which is one of the most important portions of the\r\nhuman structure, and which controls circulation, secretion, and\r\nnutrition, often by being impaired, plays a prominent part in the\r\nproduction of baldness. Thus, it has been demonstrated by modern\r\ninvestigation that the nerves of nutrition, by their defective action,\r\nare often the cause of thinning and loss of hair. The nutritive action\r\nof a part is known to suddenly fail, the hair-forming apparatus ceases\r\nto act, the skin changes from a peculiar healthy hue to a white and\r\nshining appearance, and often loses at the same time its sensibility;\r\nthe hairs drop out until very few remain, or the part becomes entirely\r\nbald. It is the overtaxing of the physical powers, excessive brain\r\nwork, the exacting demands made by parents and teachers upon\r\nchildren's mental faculties, the loss of sleep, incessant cares,\r\nanxiety, grief, excitement, the sudden depression and exaltation of\r\nspirits, irregular and hastily bolted meals, the lack of rest and\r\nrecreation, the abuse of tobacco, spirits, tea, coffee, and drugs of\r\nall forms, that are fruitful sources of this defective action of the\r\nnerves of nutrition, and consequent general thinning and loss of hair.\r\n\r\nThe hair, particularly of the head, should also receive marked local\r\nattention. In reference to the use of coverings for it, I know of no\r\nbetter rules than those which I laid down in my chapter on clothing in\r\n\"Household Practice of Medicine\" (vol. i., p. 218, William Wood & Co.,\r\nNew York), in which I state that the head is the only part of the body\r\nso protected by nature as to need no artificial covering.\r\n\r\nThe stiff hats so extensively worn by men produce more or less injury.\r\nPremature baldness most frequently first attacks that part of the head\r\nwhere pressure is made by the hat. It is, indeed, a pity that custom\r\nhas so rigidly decreed that men and women must not appear out of doors\r\nwith heads uncovered. It would be far better for the hair if to be\r\nbare-headed were the rule, and to wear a hat the exception.\r\n\r\nSince we can not change our social regulations in this respect, we\r\nshould endeavor to render them as harmless as possible.\r\n\r\nThe forms of hats that are least injurious are: for Winter, soft hats\r\nof light weight, having an open structure, or pierced with numerous\r\nholes; for Summer, light straws, also of open structure.\r\n\r\nAs regards the head-covering of women, the fashions have been for\r\nseveral years favorable to proper form. The bonnet and hat have become\r\nquite small, and cover but little of the head. This beneficial\r\ncondition, however, is in part counterbalanced by the weight of false\r\ncurls, switches, puffs, etc., by the aid of which women dress the\r\nhead. These, by interfering with evaporation of the secretions,\r\nprevent proper regulations of the temperature of the scalp, and\r\nlikewise lead to the retention of a certain amount of excrementitious\r\nmatter, both of which are prolific sources of rapid thinning and loss\r\nof hair in women.\r\n\r\nFalse hair has likewise sometimes been the means of introducing\r\nparasites, which give rise to obstinate affections of the scalp.\r\n\r\nCleanliness of the entire surface of the skin should next demand\r\nattention, and that should be done by using water as the medium of\r\nablution. It is a well-known physiological law that it is necessary,\r\nin order to enable the skin to carry on its healthful action, to have\r\nwashed off with water the constant cast of scales which become mingled\r\nwith the unctuous and saline products, together with particles of dirt\r\nwhich coat over the pores, and thus interfere with the development of\r\nthe hairs. Water for ablution can be of any temperature that may be\r\nacceptable and agreeable, according to the custom and condition of the\r\nbather's health. Many chemical substances can be combined with water\r\nto cleanse these effete productions from the skin. Soap is the most\r\nefficacious of all for cleanliness, health, and the avoidance of\r\ndisease. Soap combines better with water to render these unctuous\r\nproducts miscible, and readily removes them thoroughly from the skin.\r\nThe best variety of soap to use is the pure white soap, which cannot\r\nbe so easily adulterated by coloring material, or disguised by some\r\nperfume or medicinal substance. Ablution with soap and water should be\r\nperformed once or twice a week at least, particularly to the head and\r\nbeard, in order to keep open the hair tubes so that they may take in\r\noxygen, give out carbon, carry on their nutrition, and maintain the\r\nhairs in a fine, polished, and healthy condition. In using water to\r\nthe scalp and beard, care should be taken not to use soap-water too\r\nfrequently, as it often causes irritation of the glands, and leads to\r\nthe formation of scurf. It is equally important to avoid using on the\r\nhead, the daily shower-bath, which, by its sudden, rapid, and heavy\r\nfall, excites local irritation, and, as a result, loss of hair quickly\r\nfollows. In case the health demands the shower-bath, the hair should\r\nbe protected by a bathing cap. The most acceptable time to wash the\r\nhair, to those not accustomed to doing it with their morning bath, is\r\njust before retiring, in order to avoid going into the open air or\r\ngetting into a draught and taking cold. After washing, the hair should\r\nbe briskly rubbed with rough towels, the Turkish towel heated being\r\nparticularly serviceable. Those who are delicate or sick, and fear\r\ntaking cold or being chilled from the wet or damp hairs, should rub\r\ninto the scalp a little bay rum, alcohol, or oil, a short time after\r\nthe parts have been well chafed with towels. The oil is particularly\r\nserviceable at this period, as it is better absorbed, and at the same\r\ntime overcomes any dryness of the skin which often follows washing.\r\n\r\nIt might be well to add in this connection that I have frequently been\r\nconsulted, by those taking salt-water baths, as to the care of the\r\nhair during and after the bath. If the bather is in good health, and\r\nthe hair is normal, the bather can go into the surf and remain at\r\nleast fifteen minutes, and on coming out should rub the hair\r\nthoroughly dry with towels.\r\n\r\nLadies should permit it remain loose while doing so, after which it\r\ncan be advantageously dressed.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, often injurious to both men and women having some\r\nwasting of the hair to go into the surf without properly protecting\r\nthe head; the sea water has not, as is often thought, a tonic action\r\non the scalp; on the contrary, it often excites irritation and general\r\nthinning. Again, it is most decidedly injurious to the hair for\r\npersons to remain in the surf one or two hours, the hair wet, and the\r\nhead unprotected from the rays of the sun. This latter class of\r\nbathers, and those who hurriedly dress the hair wet, which soon\r\nbecomes mouldy and emits a disagreeable odor, are frequent sufferers\r\nfrom general loss and thinning of the hair.\r\n\r\nAn agreeable and efficient adjunct after ablution, which I have\r\nalready referred to, is oil. Oil has not only a cleansing action upon\r\nthe scalp, but it also overcomes any rough or uneven state of the\r\nhair, and gives it a soft and glossy appearance.\r\n\r\nThe oil of ergot is particularly serviceable in fulfilling these\r\nindications, and, at the same time, by its soothing and slight\r\nastringent action upon the glands, will arrest the formation of scurf.\r\nIn using oil, the animal and vegetable oils should always be\r\npreferred, as mineral oils, especially the petroleum products, have a\r\nvery poor affinity for animal tissues.\r\n\r\nPomatum is largely used by many in place of oil, as it remains on the\r\nsurface and gives a full appearance to the hairs, thus hiding,\r\nsometimes, the thinness of the hair.\r\n\r\nIt will do no harm or no special good if it contains pure grease, wax,\r\nharmless perfume, and coloring matter, but it is often highly\r\nadulterated, or, the fat in it decomposing, sets up irritation on the\r\npart to which it is applied. I therefore always advise against its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe comb and brush are also agents of the toilet by which the hair is\r\nkept clean, vigorous, and healthy. The comb should be of flexible gum,\r\nwith large, broad, blunt, round, and coarse teeth, having plenty of\r\nelasticity. It should be used to remove from the hairs any scurf or\r\ndirt that may have become entangled in them, to separate the hairs and\r\nprevent them from becoming matted and twisted together.\r\n\r\nThe fine-tooth comb, made with the teeth much closer together, can be\r\nused in place of the regular toilet comb just named when the hair is\r\nfilled with very fine particles of scurf, dirt, or when parasites and\r\ntheir eggs infest the hairs. It should, however, always be borne in\r\nmind that combs are only for the hair, and not for the scalp or the\r\nskin, which is too often torn and dug up by carelessly and roughly\r\npulling these valuable and important articles of toilet through the\r\nskin as well as the hair.\r\n\r\nThe brush with moderately stiff whalebone bristles may be passed\r\ngently over the hair several times during the day, to brush out the\r\ndust and the dandruff, and to keep the hair smooth, soft, and clean;\r\nrough and hard brushing the hair with brushes having very stiff\r\nbristles in them, especially the metal or wire bristles, is of no\r\nservice, but often irritates the parts and causes the hair to fall\r\nout. [Dr. Shoemaker then denounced the use of the so-called electric\r\nbrush, saying its use was injurious, as also was the effort to remove\r\ndandruff by the aid of the comb and brush. Continuing, he remarked:]\r\nAnd now the question arises, Should the hair be periodically cut? It\r\nmay be that cutting and shaving may for the time increase the action\r\nof the growth, but it has no permanent effect either upon the\r\nhair-bulb or the hair sac, and will not in any way add to the life of\r\nthe hair.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, cutting and shaving will cause the hair to grow\r\nlonger for the time being, but in the end will inevitably shorten its\r\nterm of life by exhausting the nutritive action of the hair-forming\r\napparatus. When the hairs are frequently cut, they will usually become\r\ncoarser, often losing the beautiful gloss of the fine and delicate\r\nhairs. The pigment will likewise change--brown, for instance, becoming\r\nchestnut, and black changing to a dark brown. In addition, the ends of\r\nvery many will be split and ragged, presenting a brush like\r\nappearance. If the hairs appear stunted in their growth upon portions\r\nof the scalp or beard, or gray hairs crop up here and there, the\r\nmethod of clipping off the ends of the short hairs, of plucking out\r\nthe ragged, withered, and gray hairs, will allow them to grow\r\nstronger, longer, and thicker.\r\n\r\nMothers, in rearing their children, should not cut their hair at\r\ncertain periods of the year (during the superstitious time of full\r\nmoon), in order to increase its length and luxuriance as they bloom\r\ninto womanhood, and manhood. This habit of cutting the hair of\r\nchildren brings evil in place of good, and is also condemned by the\r\ndistinguished worker in this department, Professor Kaposi, of Vienna,\r\nwho states that it is well known that the hair of women who possess\r\nluxuriant locks from the time of girlhood never again attains its\r\noriginal length after having once been cut.\r\n\r\nPincus has made the same observation by frequent experiment, and he\r\nadds that there is a general opinion that frequent cutting of the hair\r\nincreases its length; but the effect is different from that generally\r\nsupposed. Thus, upon one occasion he states that he cut off circles of\r\nhair an inch in diameter on the heads of healthy men, and from week to\r\nweek compared the intensity of growth of the shorn place with the rest\r\nof the hair. The result was surprising to this close and careful\r\nobserver, as he found in some cases the numbers were equal, but\r\ngenerally the growth became slower after cutting, and he has never\r\nobserved an increase in rapidity.\r\n\r\nI might also add that I believe many beardless faces and bald heads in\r\nmiddle and advancing age are often due to constant cutting and shaving\r\nin early life. The young girls and boys seen daily upon our streets\r\nwith their closely cropped heads, and the young men with their\r\nclean-shaven faces, are, year by year, by this fashion, having their\r\nhair-forming apparatus overstrained.\r\n\r\nI also must condemn the modern practice of curling and crimping, the\r\nuse of bandoline, powders, and all varieties of gum solutions, sharp\r\nhair-pins, long-pointed metal ornaments and hair combs, the wearing of\r\nchignons, false plaits, curls, and frizzes, as the latter are liable\r\nto cause headaches and tend to congestion. Likewise I protest against\r\nthe use of castor-oil and the various mixtures extolled as the best\r\nhair-tonics, restoratives, vegetable hair-dyes, or depilatories, as\r\nthey are highly injurious instead of beneficial, the majority of\r\nhair-dyes being largely composed of lead salts. But, should your\r\npatients wish to hide their gray hairs, probably the best hair-dye\r\nthat can be used safely is pyrogallic acid or walnut juice, the hairs\r\nbeing first washed with an alkaline solution to get rid of the grease.\r\nNitrate of silver is also a good and safe hair-dye, but its\r\napplication should be done by one experienced in its use. The\r\njudicious use of these hair-dyes will give the hair above the surface\r\nof the skin a brownish-black appearance, the intensity of the color of\r\nwhich depends upon the strength of the solution. But hair-dyeing for\r\npremature grayness should be avoided, as the diseased condition may be\r\naverted by the proper remedies. Never permit the hair to be bleached\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining the fashionable golden hue, as the\r\narsenical solution generally used is highly dangerous; but, if your\r\npatients must have their hair of a golden color, insist upon their\r\nhairdresser using the peroxide of hydrogen, which is less dangerous\r\nthan the preparation first mentioned.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most pernicious compounds used for the hair at the\r\npresent day is that which is sold in the shops as a depilatory. It is\r\nusually a mixture of quicklime and arsenic, and is wrongly used and\r\nrecommended at this time by many physicians to remove hairy moles and\r\nan excessive growth of hair upon ladies' faces. Its application\r\nexcites inflammation of the skin; and, while it removes the hair from\r\nthe surface for a time, it often leaves a scar, or makes the part\r\nrough, congested, and deformed.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the hair will grow after a short period stronger,\r\ncoarser, and changed in color, which will even more disfigure the\r\nperson's countenance. With the present scientific knowledge of the\r\napplication of electrolysis, hairs can be removed from the face of\r\nladies or children, or in any improper situation, in the most harmless\r\nmanner without using such obnoxious and injurious compounds as\r\ndepilatories.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, let me add that, if the hair becomes altered in\r\ntexture, or falls out gradually or suddenly, or changes in color, a\r\ndisease of the hair, either locally or generally, has set in, and the\r\nhair, and perhaps the constitution, now needs, as in any other\r\ndisease, the constant care of the physician.\r\n\r\nA general remedy for this or that hair disease that may develop will\r\nnot answer, as hair diseases, like other affections, have no one\r\nremedy which will overcome wasting, thinning, or loss of color.\r\nPatients reasoning upon this belief, frequently apply to me for a\r\nremedy to restore their hair to its full vigor or give them back its\r\ncolor. I always reply that I have no such remedy.\r\n\r\nThe general health, as well as the scalp and hairs, must be examined\r\ncarefully, particularly the latter, with the lens and microscope. All\r\nchanges must be watched, and the treatment varied from time to time\r\naccording to the indications.\r\n\r\nNo one remedy can, therefore, under any circumstances, suit, as the\r\nremedy used to-day may be changed at the next or succeeding visit. No\r\nremedy for the hair will be necessary if the foregoing advice be\r\nfollowed which I have just narrated, and which is the result of some\r\nseven years of labor and experience.\r\n\r\nThe proper consideration and putting into practice of these\r\nsuggestions will most certainly secure to the rising generation fewer\r\nbald heads and more luxuriant hair than is possessed at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      [Concluded from SUPPLEMENT No. 387, page 6179.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF EFFECTIVE BREATHING IN DELAYING THE PHYSICAL\r\nCHANGES INCIDENT TO THE DECLINE OF LIFE, AND IN THE PREVENTION OF\r\nPNEUMONIA, CONSUMPTION, AND DISEASES OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\nBy DAVID WARK, M.D., 9 East 12th Street, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\nDuring the past winter inflammation of the lungs has destroyed the\r\nlives of many persons who, although they were in most cases past the\r\nmeridian of life, yet still apparently enjoyed vigorous health, and, I\r\nhave little doubt, would still have been alive and well had the\r\npreventive means here laid down against the occurrence of the disease\r\nfrom which they perished been effectively practiced at the proper\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe most important anatomical change occurring during the progress of\r\npneumonia is the solidification of a larger or smaller part of one or\r\nboth lungs by the deposit in the terminal bronchial tubes and in the\r\nair cells of a substance by which the spongy lungs are rendered as\r\nsolid and heavy as a piece of liver. The access of the respired air to\r\nthe solidified part being totally prevented, life is inevitably\r\ndestroyed if a sufficiently large portion of the lungs be invaded.\r\n\r\nThis deposit succeeds the first or congestive stage, and it occurs\r\nwith great rapidity; an entire lobe of the lung may be rendered\r\nperfectly solid by the exudation from the blood of fully two pounds of\r\nsolid matter in the short space of twelve hours or even less. The\r\nrapidity with which the lungs become solidified amply accounts for the\r\npromptly fatal results that often attend attacks of acute pneumonia.\r\nIf recovery takes place, the foreign matter by which the lung tissue\r\nhas been solidified is perfectly absorbed and the diseased portion is\r\nfound to be quite uninjured. The only natural method by which the\r\nblood can be freed from the presence of foreign matter is by the\r\noxidation--the burning--of such impure matters; the results being\r\ncarbonic acid gas that escapes by the lungs and certain materials that\r\nare eliminated chiefly by the kidneys. But when these blood impurities\r\nexist in the vital fluid in unusually large quantities, or if the\r\nrespiratory capacity be inadequate, the natural internal crematory\r\noperations are a partial failure. But nature will not tolerate the\r\npresence of such impurities in the vital fluid; if they cannot be\r\neliminated by natural means they must by unnatural means; therefore\r\nsuch material is very frequently deposited in various parts of the\r\nbody, the point of deposit being often determined by some local\r\ndisturbance or irritation.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if a person whose blood is in fairly good condition\r\ntakes a cold that settles on his lungs, he either recovers of it\r\nspontaneously or is readily cured by means of some cough mixture; but\r\nif his blood be loaded with tubercular matter, the latter is extremely\r\nliable to be deposited in his lungs; the cough that was excited in the\r\nfirst place by a simple cold becomes worse and persistent, in a few\r\nmonths his lungs show signs of disorganization, and he has consumption\r\nof the acute or chronic type, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the impure matter by which the blood is loaded\r\nbe of the kind that causes the pulmonary solidifications of pneumonia,\r\nthe latter disease is very likely to be developed if a cold on the\r\nlungs be caught.\r\n\r\nThe liability of any individual to attacks of acute pneumonia is\r\ntherefore determined very largely by the presence or absence in his\r\nblood of the matter already alluded to. If his blood be free from it,\r\nno cold, however severe, is competent to originate the disease.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question but that good living and sedentary habits\r\nhave a strong tendency to befoul the blood; the former renders\r\neffective respiration all the more necessary for the removal from the\r\nblood of whatever nutritive matter has been taken beyond the needs of\r\nthe system, and the latter inevitably diminishes the respiratory\r\nmotions to the lowest point consistent with physical comfort. From\r\nthese conditions originates the active predisposing cause of\r\npneumonia, to which we have already alluded.\r\n\r\nThe disease is more fatal in the very young and in the aged; the\r\nmortality seems to bear a direct ratio to the respiratory capacity; in\r\nyoung subjects the breathing powers have not been fully developed like\r\nthe other physical capacities, while in the old the respiratory volume\r\nhas been diminished by the stiffening of the chest walls and of the\r\nlungs by the senile changes already detailed.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question but that protection from cold and judicious\r\nattention to the health generally, by suitable exercise and diet, has\r\na powerful tendency to prevent that overloaded condition of the blood\r\nto which I believe acute pneumonia to be chiefly due; still I have no\r\ndoubt but that the most active preventive measure that can be adopted\r\nis keeping up the respiratory capacity to the full requirements of the\r\nsystem, a precaution which is specially necessary to ease-loving and\r\nhigh-living gentlemen who are past the prime of life. I am of the\r\nopinion that if such persons would cultivate their breathing powers by\r\nthe simple means here recommended, their liability to pneumonia would\r\nbe notably reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE FIRST STAGE OF CONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\nThe progress of tubercular consumption has been divided by pathologists\r\ninto three stages. The first stage being that in which a deposit of\r\ntubercular matter occurs in the lung tissue, the second is entered on\r\nwhen the tubercles soften, and the third when they have melted down,\r\nbeen expectorated, and cavities have formed. But the real beginning of\r\nthis most insidious and justly dreaded disease not infrequently\r\nantedates for a long time, often for several years, the deposit of any\r\ntubercular matter. During all this time an expert examiner can detect\r\nthe slight but very significant changes already taking place in the\r\npulmonary organs. Physicians determine the condition of the lungs\r\nchiefly through the sounds elicited by percussion of the chest walls\r\nby the end of the middle finger, or a small rubber hammer adapted to\r\nthe purpose, and by those produced by the respired air rushing in to\r\nand out of the bronchial tubes and air vesicles. The percussion sounds\r\nyielded by the chest during what has been aptly called the\r\npre-tubercular stage do not differ from those elicited in health,\r\nbecause it is only when some morbid matter exists in the lungs that\r\nthe percussion note is altered, therefore negative results only are\r\nobtained in the real first stage by this mode of examination. But\r\nimportant information can be obtained by interrogating the sounds due\r\nto the inspired air rushing into and distending the air vesicles. When\r\nthe lungs are perfectly healthy, these are breezy and almost musical.\r\nDuring the pre-tubercular stage they become drier and harsher;\r\nqualities of evil omen that continue to increase as time passes, if\r\nproperly directed means be not adopted to correct the evil; but so far\r\nnone of the symptoms that indicate the slightest deposit of tubercle\r\ncan be detected, but the breathing capacity of such persons is never\r\nup to the full requirements of the system. The reader is referred to\r\nthe table already given, which exhibits the decline of the breathing\r\ncapacity of persons suffering from consumption in its several stages.\r\nWhen the disease has made such decided progress that tubercles are\r\nalready deposited in the lungs in sufficient quantity to give rise to\r\nthe physical signs by which their presence is proved, this carefully\r\ncompiled table shows that the diminution of the vital capacity already\r\namounts to one-third of that considered by Dr. Hutchinson to be\r\nnecessary to the maintenance of health.\r\n\r\nDuring the pre-tubercular stage the breathing capacity rarely falls so\r\nmuch as 33 per cent. below the healthy standard, but it is never up to\r\nthe normal vital volume. This fact is most significant, especially\r\nwhen it occurs in an individual whose relatives have succumbed to this\r\ndisease; but it rarely attracts sufficient attention from such persons\r\nas to induce them to have their breathing capacity measured, much less\r\nto take effective measures to bring and keep it up to the healthy\r\nstandard. So long as there are, to them, no tangible symptoms of\r\napproaching mischief, and they feel fairly well, they act as if they\r\nthought \"that all men were mortal but themselves.\" Yet it is from\r\namong persons who have an inherited but latent tendency to tubercular\r\ndisease, and whose lung power is below par, that the great army of\r\nconsumptives who die every year is recruited. It is very difficult to\r\ninduce persons who ought to be interested in this matter to take\r\neffective measures for their future safety when the terrible symptoms\r\naccompanying the last stages of the disease often fail to shake the\r\nsufferer's confident expectation of recovery; and we sometimes see\r\nthem engaged in laying plans for the future when death is imminent. I\r\nregret deeply to be obliged to make these statements, because I am\r\nconvinced that if the suggestions laid down in this work were\r\ngenerally reduced to practice by those who have reason to dread the\r\ndevelopment of tubercular disease, many valuable lives would be saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF TUBERCULAR MATTER IN THE BLOOD.\r\n\r\nDuring the digestive processes the starchy, saccharine, and albuminoid\r\nelements of food are dissolved, and the fatty matters are emulsified.\r\nA uniform milky solution is thus formed, which is rapidly absorbed\r\ninto the general circulation; some of it passes directly through the\r\nwalls of the vessels into the blood, and some is taken up by the\r\nlacteals and reaches the vital fluid by traversing the complicated\r\nseries of tubes known as the absorbent system, and the numerous glands\r\nconnected with it. The chief function of the starchy and fatty food\r\nelements is to keep up the physical temperature, by being submitted to\r\noxidation in the organism; therefore it is not necessary that they\r\nshould experience any vitalizing change, but are fitted to discharge\r\ntheir duties in the vital domain by simply undergoing the solution\r\nthat fits them for absorption. But the materials intended to enter\r\ninto the composition of the body must be developed into living blood,\r\nin order to be fitted to become part and parcel of the organs by which\r\npower is evolved, and through the use of which we see, hear, feel,\r\nthink, and move. This wonderful process begins and is carried forward\r\nin the absorbent system, which has been described by Dr. Carpenter as\r\na great blood-making gland. But the vital transformation is not\r\ncompleted until the nutritive materials have been submitted to the\r\naction of the liver, and afterward to the influence of oxygen in the\r\ncapillaries of the lungs. The food that was eaten a few hours before\r\nis thus converted into rich scarlet arterial blood, if every part of\r\nthe complex vitalizing processes has been properly conducted. But the\r\ninfluence of oxygen is requisite, not only to complete the\r\nvitalization of the embryo blood in the lungs, it is an absolutely\r\nessential element in every step of the vitalizing process in the\r\nabsorbents.\r\n\r\nThe average quantity of food required to sustain an ordinary man in\r\nhealth and strength, I have previously stated, is about two pounds\r\navoirdupois daily, and an equal weight of oxygen is necessary to the\r\nintegrity of the vitalizing processes undergone by the food, and to\r\nmaintain the physical temperature. When the requisite supply of oxygen\r\nis reduced, the extrication of heat within the system is promptly\r\ndiminished, but the vitalization of digested food is unfavorably\r\naffected much more slowly, but with equal certainty. If the quota of\r\noxygen existing in the arterial blood of the vessels whose duty it is\r\nto supply the vital fluid to the absorbent system, be inadequate to\r\nenable these operations to go on properly, the life-giving processes\r\nmust necessarily be imperfectly accomplished. Under these\r\ncircumstances the digested material is imperfectly vitalized, and is\r\ntherefore inadequately fitted to be used in building up and repairing\r\nthe living body. But its course in the system cannot be delayed, much\r\nless stopped.\r\n\r\nThe blood possesses a definite constitution, which cannot be\r\nmaterially altered without the rapid development of grave, perhaps\r\nfatal consequences. The nutritive matters received into the blood must\r\nbe given up by it to the tissues for their repair, whether such\r\nmaterials are well or ill fitted for the vital purposes. Dr. B.W.\r\nCarpenter, of London, the celebrated physiologist, makes the following\r\npertinent statements on this subject, which I condense from his great\r\nwork on physiology: \"We frequently find an imperfectly organizable\r\nproduct, known by the designation of tubercular matter, taking the\r\nplace of the normal elements of tissue, both in the ordinary process\r\nof nutrition, and still more when inflammation is set up.\r\n\r\nFrom the examination of the blood of tuberculous subjects it appears\r\nthat, although the bulk of the coagulum obtained by stirring or\r\nbeating is usually greater than that of healthy blood, yet this\r\ncoagulum is not composed or well elaborated fibriae, for it is soft\r\nand loose, and contains an unusually large number of colorless blood\r\ncorpuscles, while the red corpuscles form an abnormally small\r\nproportion of it. We can understand, therefore, that such a constant\r\ndeficiency in capacity for organization must unfavorably affect the\r\nordinary nutritive processes; and that there will be a liability to\r\nthe deposit of imperfectly vitalized matter, instead of the normal\r\nelements of tissue, even without any inflammation. Such appears to be\r\nthe history of the formation of tubercles in the lungs and other\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nWhen it occurs as a kind of metamorphosis of the ordinary nutritive\r\nprocesses and in this manner, it may proceed insidiously for a long\r\nperiod, so that a large part of the tissue of the lungs shall be\r\nreplaced by tubercular deposit without any other sign than an\r\nincreasing difficulty of respiration.\" These views are strongly\r\ncorroborated by the following facts:\r\n\r\nIn making post mortem examinations of persons who have died of\r\nconsumption, tubercles of different kinds are found in the same\r\nsubject; some of these, having been deposited during what is called\r\nthe first stage of the disease before the breathing powers were much\r\nimpaired, bear evident traces of organization in the form of cells and\r\nfibers more or less obvious, these being sometimes almost as perfectly\r\nformed as living matter, at least on the superficial part of the\r\ndeposit, which is in immediate contact with the living structures\r\naround.\r\n\r\nThis variety of tubercle has a tendency to contract and remain in the\r\nlungs without doing much injury. But as the disease progressed, and\r\nthe breathing capacity progressively diminished, tubercular matter\r\noccurs, evincing less and less organization, showing a tendency to\r\nbreak down and cause inflammation in the surrounding lung tissue,\r\nuntil at last we find crude yellow tubercles that have become\r\nsoftened, and formed cavities almost as soon as they were deposited.\r\n\r\nSome cases of chronic consumption pass in a few months through the\r\nvarious stages from the deposit of the first tubercle to a fatal\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the disease is determined largely by the nature of the\r\ntubercular matter at the time it is deposited.\r\n\r\nThe variety of matter which has been partially vitalized commonly\r\nexists in small quantity, has a strong tendency to maintain its\r\nsemi-organized condition unchanged by time, and rarely causes\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nA small or moderate quantity of this sort of tubercle exists in the\r\nlungs of many persons, in whom it produces no tangible symptoms, and\r\nwho are therefore quite unconscious of its presence; and even when it\r\ndoes exist in sufficient quantity to develop the symptoms of lung\r\ndisorder, the progress of the disease is slow, often continuing for\r\nmany years. It constitutes a variety of consumption which is specially\r\namenable to proper treatment. On the other hand, the soft, yellow,\r\ncheesy, tubercular matter, which is totally destitute of any vitality,\r\nis too often deposited in large quantities, acts on the adjacent lung\r\ntissue as an active irritant, causes inflammation, undergoes\r\nsoftening, forms cavities, defies treatment, and rapidly hurries the\r\nsufferers to a premature grave. These facts, taken in connection with\r\nthe immunity from lung diseases enjoyed by those whose respiratory\r\ncapacity is well developed and properly used, as well as the\r\nbeneficial effects that are promptly secured in the favorable\r\nvarieties of consumption by any important increase in the vital\r\nvolume, I believe fully justify the statement that _tubercles are the\r\nresults of defective nutrition directly traceable to inadequate\r\nrespiratory capacity_, either congenital or acquired--in other words,\r\ntubercles are composed of particles of food which have failed to\r\nacquire sufficient life while undergoing the vital processes, because\r\nthe person in whom they occur habitually breathed too little fresh\r\nair.\r\n\r\nPersons who possess what is called the scrofulous constitution are\r\nspecially liable to the occurrence of tubercular matter when their\r\nrespiration is defective, or they are exposed to any other influences\r\nthat favor its development in the organism. But habitually defective\r\nrespiration, or the breathing of an atmosphere containing too little\r\noxygen, which practically amounts to the same thing, has a very\r\npowerful tendency in the same direction, in persons who are apparently\r\nas free from scrofulous taint as any human being can be.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VALUE OF COD-LIVER OIL IN THE PREVENTION OF CONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\nThere is a broad but not commonly recognized distinction between what\r\nconstitutes a medicine and a food. All the materials that normally\r\nenter into the composition of the living body, and are necessary to\r\nthe maintenance of health and strength, may be property classed as\r\nfoods, whether they be obtained from the animal, vegetable, or mineral\r\nkingdoms; thus the iron, sulphur, phosphorus, lime, potash, etc.,\r\nrequired by the system usually exist in and are organically combined\r\nwith the various foods in common use, and they are perhaps quite as\r\nessential to the physical well-being as albuminoid, fatty, and\r\nsaccharine matters. When the system is suffering from lack of any of\r\nthe above mentioned chemicals, their administration is to be regarded\r\nas the giving of nutritive substances, although they be prescribed by\r\na physician in divided doses and procured from a pharmacist.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a medicine is any substance that does not naturally\r\nenter into the composition of the body, but which has the power, when\r\nskillfully used, to modify the physical processes so that\r\nphysiological disorder--disease, shall be replaced by physiological\r\nharmony--health. Belladonna, hyoscyamus, opium, etc., are familiar\r\nexamples of medicaments. Therefore a food is any substance that is\r\ncapable of directly contributing to the nutrition of the body, and\r\nmedicine is a substance competent, under proper conditions, to secure\r\nthe same results indirectly. Viewed in the light of the above\r\ndefinition, cod-liver oil is to be regarded as a very valuable food,\r\nas well as a most effective remedy both for the prevention and cure of\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nI have previously stated that food is divided by physiologists into\r\nthree great classes. The albuminoids are used to build up the\r\norganism, while the fatty and saccharine are burned in the body to\r\nkeep it warm. Although these are the chief functions devolving on the\r\nabove mentioned food elements, yet they are mutually interdependent on\r\neach other for the proper performance of their several offices. Thus\r\nthe albuminoids cannot undergo the wonderful vitalizing process\r\nnecessary to fit them to enter into and form part of the living body,\r\nexcept an adequate quantity of fatty matter be present to assist in\r\nthe vital transformation. On the other hand, the assistance of the\r\nalbuminoids is equally necessary to enable the fatty and saccharine\r\nfoods to maintain the internal heat of the body. Of all fatty matters,\r\nwhether derived from the animal or vegetable kingdom, none possesses\r\nthe property of stimulating and perfecting the nutritive processes in\r\nso high a degree as cod-liver oil; it is more readily emulsified and\r\nfitted for absorption by the pancreatic secretion during intestinal\r\ndigestion than any other fatty matter of which we have any knowledge.\r\nThe beneficial effects of its use have been proved in myriads of cases\r\nof confirmed consumption, and if it were used for prolonged periods by\r\npersons who are losing weight, and whose breathing capacity is too\r\nlittle, along with effective cultivation of the latter function, many\r\npersons would escape this disease who now succumb to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF NORMAL BREATHING ON THE FEMALE GENERATIVE\r\nORGANS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe body is divided into three separate stories by two partitions. The\r\ndiaphragm, A, separates the cavity of the chest from that of the\r\nabdomen. The partition, _D_, forms a floor for the digestive cavity,\r\nF, and a roof for the pelvis; the pelvic cavity is occupied mainly by\r\nthe generative organs. The upper part of the uterus is firmly fixed to\r\nthe partition, D, by which the pelvis is covered. Now, the diaphragm,\r\nA, and the external respiratory muscles are in ceaseless motion\r\nperforming the act of breathing. The diaphragm acts like the piston of\r\na pump, both on the lungs above, and on the contents of the abdominal\r\nand pelvic cavities below. When it rises from B to A, it diminishes\r\nthe size of the thoracic cavity, compresses the lungs, and assists in\r\nthe expiratory part of breathing; at the same time it acts through the\r\ncontents of the abdominal cavity on the pelvic roof, D, to which the\r\nuterus is attached, and raises it from D to C. When the diaphragm\r\ncontracts, it descends from A to B, increases the size of the thoracic\r\ncavity, inflates the lungs, promotes the inspiratory part of\r\nbreathing, pushes the walls of the chest and abdomen outward from F to\r\nE, and lowers the pelvic roof at the same time the uterus sinks from C\r\nto D. When the effect of these respiratory motions is not diminished\r\nby muscular debility, rigidity of the thoracic walls, or by unsuitable\r\nclothing, they have so direct an effect on the pelvic contents that\r\nthe uterus and its appendages make two distinct motions every time a\r\nwoman breathes. When the diaphragm rises and the breath is expelled,\r\nthe womb is elevated from one inch to one inch and a half, because the\r\nroof of the pelvis, to which it is attached, is lifted about this\r\ndistance, because of gentle suction from above. The uterus and its\r\nappendages are thus kept in constant motion, up and down, chiefly by\r\naction of the muscles by which breathing is carried on.\r\n\r\nSeveral influences combine to maintain the circulation of the blood.\r\nThe pumping action of the heart and the affinity of the blood for the\r\nwalls of the capillary vessels require to be assisted by the motion\r\nboth of the body as a whole and of its parts in order to keep the\r\ncirculation flowing equably through every tissue. Therefore muscular\r\naction and the resulting bodily motion play a very important part in\r\nmaintaining the general and local blood circulation. During the\r\ncontraction of a muscle, the blood current flowing through it is, for\r\nthe time being, retarded, but when relaxation occurs the blood flows\r\ninto its vessels more freely than if no momentary cessation had taken\r\nplace. When the body or any of its parts is deprived of motion, the\r\nblood circulation stagnates, and the nutrition, general or local, as\r\nthe case may be, promptly becomes impaired. This is specially true of\r\nthe uterus. Gentle but constant motion is absolutely essential to keep\r\nup a healthy uterine blood circulation. Nature has provided for the\r\nautomatic performance of all the ceaseless internal motions that are\r\nnecessary to the continuance of life and the preservation of health;\r\nthus the heart beats, the respiratory muscles act, the stomach\r\nexecutes a churning motion during gastric digestion, the intestines\r\npass on their contents by worm-like contractions, automatically\r\nwithout our supervision and without causing fatigue, being under the\r\ncontrol of the sympathetic system of nerves chiefly. It is equally\r\ntrue, but not so well recognized, that the previously described\r\nmotions that are committed to the pelvic organs from the respiratory\r\napparatus are absolutely necessary to the continued health of the\r\nuterus and its appendages. But the womb is not under the control of\r\nthe voluntary muscles, therefore it cannot be directly moved by them,\r\nnor are its necessary motions influenced by the sympathetic system of\r\nnerves as are the heart, stomach, and intestines, etc., but it is\r\nfortunately under the indirect but positive control of involuntary\r\nmuscles that never, as long as breathing continues, cease their work.\r\nNature has thus made ample provision to keep the uterus in automatic\r\nmotion. As before stated, the natural ceaseless heavings of the lungs,\r\nchest, and diaphragm, aided by the muscles inclosing the abdomen, have\r\nthe duty assigned them of communicating automatic motion to the uterus\r\nand the other contents of the pelvis. When the diaphragm descends from\r\nA to B, and the lungs are filled with air, the uterus sinks in the\r\npelvic cavity in obedience to the downward pressure from above, as\r\nbefore stated; the circulation through the uterus is then for a moment\r\nretarded, but the next instant, when the lungs are emptied of air and\r\nthe diaphragm rises, the blood flows forward more freely than if it\r\nhad not been momentarily obstructed. Ample provision has thus been\r\nmade to maintain a healthy circulation through the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe uterine motions I have described are fully adequate for the\r\npurposes indicated. But when the natural stimulus of motion is\r\nwithheld, the circulation becomes sluggish causing congestion, which\r\nmay develop into inflammation. Under these conditions the uterus\r\ngradually becomes displaced, falling backward, forward or downward as\r\nthe case may be. The blood vessels by which the uterus is supplied\r\nthus have their caliber diminished by bending; the circulation through\r\nthem is retarded just as the flow of water in a rubber tube is\r\nobstructed by a kink. A very good idea of what occurs in the uterus\r\nunder the conditions just described may be obtained by winding a\r\nstring around the fingers.\r\n\r\nAs the coats of the arteries are thick, and the pressure exerted by\r\nthe ligature has less power to prevent the arterial blood flowing\r\noutward past the string to the end of the finger than it has to\r\nprevent the return of the venous blood toward the heart, therefore the\r\npart beyond the ligature soon becomes congested, the blood stagnating\r\nin the capillaries. If the ligature be sufficiently tight and kept on\r\nlong enough, mortification will take place, but if the circulation be\r\nonly moderately obstructed, the congestion will continue until\r\nulceration occurs. A similar condition is developed in the uterus when\r\nthe necessary natural stimulus of motion fails to be communicated to\r\nit or when it is so far out of its proper place that the circulation\r\nthrough it is obstructed.\r\n\r\nI believe the above described condition to be a most potent but\r\ninadequately recognized cause of the various forms of uterine diseases\r\nthat distress so many women.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOWING HOW THE BREATHING POWERS MAY BE DEVELOPED.\r\n\r\nWhen the circumference of the chest bears a due proportion to the size\r\nof the body generally; when its walls and the lungs possess a suitable\r\ndegree of elasticity; when the strength of the respiratory muscles is\r\nadequate to their work, and no undue opposition is offered to the\r\nbreathing motions by the clothing--then the vital volume is always up\r\nto the full requirements of the system. But when one or all of these\r\nare lacking in any important degree, the breathing capacity is\r\nproportionately diminished. If the testimony of the spirometer be\r\ncorroborated by the impaired physical condition of the individual, its\r\ncorrection should be sought in part at least by enlarging the chest,\r\nincreasing the elasticity of its walls and of the lungs, and by\r\naugmenting the strength of the respiratory muscles. These results may\r\ncommonly be secured by diligent and persevering use of the following\r\nexercises:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nA trapeze, Fig. 2, should be suspended from the ceiling, so that the\r\nbar shall be six inches above the head of the person who is to use it;\r\nthe toes should be placed under straps nailed to the floor to keep\r\nthem in position. Then if the bar be grasped and the body thrown\r\nforward, the trapeze, the arms, and the body will form the segment of\r\na circle.\r\n\r\nThe exercise is taken by causing the body to describe a complete\r\ncircle in the manner indicated in the cut. Little muscular effort is\r\nrequired if the motion be rapid, because the momentum is sufficient to\r\ncarry the body around; but if the rotation be slow, more exertion is\r\nrequired. This movement is specially adapted to the breathing powers\r\nof weak persons, yet the most vigorous can readily get from it all the\r\nexercise their chest and lungs require.\r\n\r\nBy means of these exercises the chest is gently but effectively\r\nexpanded in every direction and the elasticity of its walls promoted,\r\nthe air cells are expanded, and the lungs are rendered more permeable\r\nto the respired air, and the strength of the respiratory muscles is\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nFig. 3 illustrates an exercise for the chest that is taken without any\r\napparatus other than an ordinary doorway. The exerciser should stand\r\nin the position indicated in the engraving, and then step forward with\r\neach foot alternately as far as possible without stretching the chest\r\ntoo severely. The longer the step the more vigorous the exercise will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nFig. 4 shows an exercise taken between two chairs; the position\r\nindicated in the cut having been assumed, the chest is then slowly\r\nlowered and raised three to six times. This exercise is adapted to\r\nstrong persons only.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF ADEQUATE RESPIRATION IN SPECIAL CASES.\r\n\r\nWhen the nutrition of the body is promoted by effective respiration,\r\nand waste matters are promptly removed, the chances that tubercle will\r\nbe developed in persons who are predisposed thereto are reduced to a\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\nBetter materials are furnished by the nutritive processes to renew the\r\ntissues, so that the occurrence of those degenerations that result in\r\nvarious fatal affections, peculiar to the decline of life, are\r\nrendered much less probable or are prevented altogether, and the\r\nchances that death shall take place by old age is increased. The\r\nsystem possesses much greater resisting power against the influence of\r\nmalaria and the poisons that give rise to typhoid fever, scarlatina,\r\ndiphtheria, measles, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the motions of a woman's respiratory organs are normal and are\r\nproperly communicated to the pelvic organs, she enjoys the greatest\r\npossible immunity attainable against the development of any diseases\r\npeculiar to the sex.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVITAL DISCOVERIES IN OBSTRUCTED AIR AND VENTILATION.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read by Wm. C. Conant before the Polytechnic Association\r\nof the American Institute, New York, May 10, 1883.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose that we all consider ourselves to be sufficiently impressed\r\nwith the importance of ventilation. If I should stop here to declaim\r\nagainst foul exhalations, or to dwell upon the virtues of fresh air,\r\nyou might feel inclined to interrupt me by saying, \"Oh, we know all\r\nabout that! If you have anything practical to advance, come to the\r\npoint.\" Gentlemen, I beg your pardon, but I must say that the great\r\nfact concerning ventilation, as yet, is that its strongest advocates\r\nare not conscious of one-half the seriousness of the subject; and the\r\nsecond fact is that the supposed means of ventilation prescribed by\r\nscience _fail to secure it_.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is my point to-night--the supreme necessity, still urgent,\r\nand _universally_ urgent, for a reformation of the breath of life. I\r\nbelieve in a promised time when the days of a man's life shall again\r\nbe as the days of a tree. And next to the abolition of vice and sin, I\r\nbelieve that the very grandest factor of such result must be an entire\r\ndisuse of obstructed air for the lungs. I propose to bring forward\r\nsome evidence of the necessity, and likewise of the possibility, of a\r\nreform so radical and sweeping as this. The subject is too wide for\r\nthe occasion. I shall be able to read only extracts from what I have\r\nprepared, in the few minutes that you can give with patience to my\r\nunpracticed lecturing.\r\n\r\nThe best prescription that doctors have to give (when we are not too\r\nfar gone to take it) is to live out of doors. Why is this? Why is life\r\nout of doors proverbially synonymous with robust health? Why is it\r\nthat a superior vitality, and a singular exemption from disease,\r\nnotoriously distinguish dwellers in the open air, by land or sea?\r\nWithout disparaging the virtues of exercise or of bracing temperature,\r\nindispensable as these are for the recuperation of enfeebled\r\nconstitutions, we must admit that among the native and settled\r\ninhabitants of the open air high health is the rule in warm climates\r\nas well as in cold, and with the very laziest mortals that bask in the\r\nsun, or loaf in the woods. The fact is that simple vegetative health\r\nseems to be nearly independent of all other external conditions but\r\nthat of a pure natural diet for the lungs. Man in nature seems to\r\nthrive as spontaneously as plants, by the free grace of air, earth,\r\nand sun. On the other hand, the very diseases from which houses are\r\nsupposed to defend us--that most numerous class resulting from\r\ncolds--are the special scourge of the lives that are most carefully\r\nshielded from their commonly supposed cause--exposure to the open air.\r\nThose diseases diminish, and entirely disappear, just so far as\r\nexposure in the pure and freely moving air becomes complete and\r\nhabitual. Soldiers, inured to camp life, catch cold if they once sleep\r\nin a house; and, generally speaking, the inhabitants of the free air\r\ncontract colds _only_ by exposure to confined exhalations from their\r\nown or other bodies, within the walls of houses. The explanation of\r\nthis is plain and simple: Carbonic acid detained within four walls\r\naccumulates in place of the breath of life--oxygen--and narcotizes the\r\nexcretory function of the skin. The moment that this great and\r\ncontinual vent of waste and impurity from the system is obstructed,\r\ninternal derangement ensues in every direction. All hands, so to\r\nspeak, are strained to extra duty to discharge the noxious\r\naccumulation. The lungs labor to discharge the load thrown back upon\r\nthem, with hastened respiration, increased combustion, and feverish\r\nheat. The pores of the mucous membrane in the nose, throat, alimentary\r\ncanal, or bronchial passages, are forced by an aggravated discharge\r\n(or catarrh), and this congestive and inflammatory pressure is a fever\r\nalso. There is nothing of \"cold\" about it except as an auxiliary and\r\nantecedent, in cases where an external chill has struck upon nerves\r\nalready half paralyzed by the universal narcotic--carbonic acid--which\r\nhouse dwellers may be said to \"smoke\" perpetually.\r\n\r\nSo much for nerve-poison; but blood-poisoning is a still more terrible\r\ncharacteristic of house-protected existence. It is now the almost\r\nuniversal opinion of the medical profession that the whole class of\r\nmalarial and zymotic diseases that make such frightful progress and\r\nhavoc in the most civilized communities, are due to living germs with\r\nwhich the exhalations of organic waste and decay are everywhere loaded\r\nin inconceivable numbers. They are known to multiply themselves many\r\ntimes over, every two or three hours. They swarm into the blood by\r\nmillions, through all the absorbents, especially those of the lungs,\r\nthat drink the atmosphere in which they are suffered to linger and\r\npropagate. Mr. Dancer, the eminent microscopist, counted in a sample\r\nfrom such an atmosphere a number of organized germs equivalent to\r\n3,700,000 in the volume of air hourly inhaled by one person. That is\r\nover 60,000 germs per minute, and about 2,000 in every breath. In the\r\nblood, they still propagate, and feed, and grow, consuming its oxygen,\r\nthus defeating its purification, and turning that stream of otherwise\r\nhealthful and invigorating nutrition into a stream of effete and\r\ncorrupt matter--a sewer rather than a river of life--or at best an\r\nimpoverished and impure supply for the support of existence.\r\n\r\nThe same pestilential but invisible hosts of bacteria, mustered and\r\nbred in the close filthiness of Oriental cities, and jungles, swarm\r\nout as Asiatic cholera on the wings of the wind, sweeping the wide\r\nworld with havoc. Settled on the tropical shores of the Eastern\r\nAtlantic, they lie in wait for their victims in the sluggish and\r\nterrible coast fever. On the western coast of the same ocean, perhaps\r\nfrom some cause connected with oceanic or atmospheric currents, they\r\nmake devastating irruptions inland, as yellow fever, in every\r\ndirection where the walls of their enclosure are low enough to be\r\nfreely passed. These, let us remember, are all essentially the same\r\norganic poison that is engendered _wherever_ life and death are plying\r\ntheir perpetual game; and this, like Cleopatra's \"worm, will do its\r\nkind\" in the veins of man, wherever obstructions, natural or\r\nartificial, temporary or permanent, interfere with its prompt\r\ndiffusion in the vastness of the general atmosphere. Our \"house of\r\nlife\" stands generously open, for every \"inmate bad\" to come and go\r\nthrough the absorbent, unquestioned, except in the stomach, where the\r\ntangible poisons have to go by the act of swallowing and where they\r\nare often challenged and ejected. It seems at first thought very\r\nstrange that we are not so well protected by natural instinct or\r\nsensibility from the subtle poisons of the atmosphere as from those\r\nthat can affect us only by the voluntary act of swallowing. The\r\nobvious explanation, however, of this apparent neglect is that Nature\r\nprotects us in general from gaseous poisons by her own system of\r\nventilation; and if, when we devise houses, necessarily excluding that\r\nsystem, we fail to devise also a sufficient substitute for it, the\r\nconsequences of such negligence are as fairly due as when we swallow\r\ntangible poison.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto referred only to the _dispersion_ of poisonous\r\nexhalations, as if the best and most necessary thing the atmosphere\r\ncan do for us were to dilute the dose to a comparatively harmless\r\npotency. But this is now known to be not the true remedial process\r\nwith respect to the zymotic germs. The most wonderful achievement of\r\nrecent investigation reveals a philosophy of both bane and antidote\r\nthat astonishes us with its simplicity as much as with its efficiency.\r\nAt the moment when humanity stands aghast at the announcement that\r\ngerms are not destroyed by disinfectants, comes the counter discovery\r\nthat they are rendered harmless by oxygen. It seems that it makes no\r\ndifference, really, of what sort or from what source are the bacteria\r\nthat we take into the blood. The only material difference to us\r\ndepends on _the sort of atmosphere_ in which their hourly generations\r\nare bred. For example, the bacteria _developed in confined air_, from\r\na simple infusion of hay, are found by experiment to be as capable of\r\ngenerating that most terrible of blood poisoners, the malignant\r\npustule, as are the bacteria taken from the pustule itself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the bacteria from the malignant pustule itself,\r\nafter propagating for a few hours in pure and free air, become a\r\nperfectly harmless race, and are actually injected into the blood\r\nwith impunity. The explanation of the strange discovery is this--note\r\nits extreme simplicity--bacteria bred in copious oxygen perish for\r\nwant of it as soon as they enter the blood vessels; whereas those\r\ninured to an unventilated atmosphere for a few generations, which\r\nmeans only a few hours, are prepared to thrive and propagate\r\ninfinitely within our veins; and that is the whole mystery of blood\r\npoisoning and zymotic diseases. Taken in connection with the narcotic\r\nor _nerve-poisoning_ power of carbonic acid (to which all the classes\r\nof diseases resulting from colds are due), we have also in this simple\r\nbut grand discovery the whole mystery of the question with which we\r\nset out--why free air is health, and why sickness is a purely domestic\r\nproduct. The restitution of natural health to mankind demands only,\r\nbut demands absolutely, the constant diffusion in copious and\r\ncontinuous floods of atmospheric oxygen, of the nerve-poisoning\r\ncarbonic acid of combustion (organic and inorganic), and of the\r\nblood-poisoning bacteria of organic decomposition.\r\n\r\nWe find, then, as a matter both of experience and of philosophy, that\r\nlife or death, in the main and in the long run, turns on the single\r\npivot of atmospheric movement or obstruction. The resistance of mere\r\nrising ground or dense vegetation to a free movement of the air from\r\nlow-lying levels performs an obstructive office similar to that of the\r\nwalls and roofs of houses, and with like effect. The invariable\r\ncondition of unhealthy _seasons_ and _days_ is a state of rarefaction\r\nand stagnation of the atmosphere, when the poison-freighted vapor\r\ncannot be lifted and dispersed, and every one complains of the sultry,\r\nclose, \"muggy\" (meaning _murky_) feeling of the air. Few reflect, when\r\nfretted by the boisterous winds of March, upon the vital office they\r\nperform in dispersing and sanitating the bacteria-laden exhalations\r\nlet loose by the first warmth from the soaked soil and the macerated\r\ndeposits of the former year.\r\n\r\nThe passing air, then, that we breathe so lightly, is on other\r\nbusiness, and carries a load we little think of, and that is not to be\r\ntrifled with. This grand carrier of nature, on business of life or\r\ndeath, must not be detained, must not be hindered! or they who\r\ninterfere with the business by restraining walls and roofs will take\r\nthe consequences. It is a good deal like stopping a bullet, except as\r\nto consciousness and suddenness of effect.\r\n\r\nThat men live at all in their obstructed and therefore poison-loaded\r\natmosphere, is a proof of the wonderful efficiency of the protective\r\neconomy of Nature within us; so wonderful, indeed, that few can\r\nbelieve the fact of living to be consistent with the real existence of\r\nsuch a deadly environment as science pretends to reveal. It is a\r\ncommon impression, therefore, that actual results fail to justify the\r\nalarm sounded by sanitarians. Hence the necessity for calling\r\nattention at the outset to an ample and manifest equivalent for the\r\ndeadly dose of confined exhalations taken daily by all civilized men.\r\nWe perceive that that dose is not lost, like the Humboldt River, in a\r\n\"sink,\" but reappears, like the wide-sown grass, in a perennial and\r\nuniversal crop of diseases, almost numberless and ever increasing in\r\nnumber, peculiar to house-dwellers. The trail of these plagues stops\r\nnowhere else; it leads straight to the imprisoned atmosphere in our\r\nartificial inclosures, and there it ends. That marvelous protective\r\neconomy of Nature within us, to which we have referred, is no\r\nperpetual guaranty against the consequences of our negligence; it is\r\nonly a limited reprieve, to afford space for repentance; and unless we\r\nhasten to improve the day of grace, the suspended sentence comes down,\r\nupon us at last with force the more accumulated by delay.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, the grand problem of sanitary science (almost\r\nuntouched, almost unrecognized) proves to be no other and no less than\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nWhat can be done to remedy the obstructive nature of an inclosure, so\r\nthat its gaseous contents shall _move off_, and be replaced by pure\r\nair, as freely, as rapidly, and as incessantly, as in the open\r\natmosphere?\r\n\r\nIt happens to be the most necessary preliminary in approaching this\r\nproblem, to show how _not_ to do it, for that, respectfully be it\r\nspoken, is what we have hitherto practiced, as results abundantly\r\nprove. Fallacies, both vulgar and scientific, obstruct our way. A\r\nfundamental fallacy respects the very nature of the work, which is\r\nsupposed to be _to get in fresh air_. In point of fact, this care is\r\nboth unnecessary and comparatively useless. Take care of the bad air,\r\nand the fresh air will take care of itself. Only make room for it, and\r\nyou cannot keep it out. On the other hand, unless you first make room\r\nfor it, you cannot keep it _in_; pump it in and blow it in as you may,\r\nyou only blow it _through_, as the Jordan flows comparatively\r\nuncontaminated through the Dead Sea. This is a law of fluids that must\r\nbe kept in view. The pure air is quite as ready to get out as to get\r\nin; while the air loaded with poisonous vapors is as sluggish as a\r\ngorged serpent, and will not budge but on compulsion. Such compulsion\r\nthe grand system of wind _suction_, actuated by the sun, supplies on\r\nthe scale of the universe; and this we must imitate and adapt for our\r\nmore limited purposes.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if we need not pause to notice so shallow though\r\ncommon a notion as that which usually comes in right here, namely,\r\nthat confined air will move off somehow of itself, if you give it\r\nliberty; being supposed to be much like a cat in a bag, wanting only a\r\nhole to make its escape. Air is ponderable matter--as much so as\r\nlead--and equally requires force of some kind to set it or keep it in\r\nmotion. But applied philosophy itself relies on a fallacious, or, at\r\nbest, inadequate source of motive power for ventilation. It gravely\r\nprescribes ventilating flues and even holes, and promises us that the\r\nwarmed air within the house will rise through these flues and holes,\r\ncarrying its impurities away with it, from the pressure of the cooler\r\nand denser air without. But we very well know that the best of flues\r\nand chimneys will draw only by favor of lively fires or clear weather.\r\nThey fail us utterly when most needed, in warm and murky weather, when\r\nthe barometer is low, and the thin atmosphere drops, down its damp and\r\ndirty contents, burying us to the chimney tops in a pestilent\r\ncongregation of vapors.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, so far as I can discover, these holes and flues, at best\r\na little fire at the bottom of the latter, are the sole and\r\nall-sufficient expedients of science and architecture for ventilation\r\nto this _day_, in spite of their total failure in experience. I can\r\nfind nothing in standard treatises or examples from philosophers or\r\narchitects, beyond a theoretical calculation on so much expansion of\r\nair from so many units of heat, and hence so much ascensional force\r\n_inferred_ in the ventilating flue--a result which never comes to\r\npass, yet none the less continues to be cheerfully relied on.\r\nUnfortunately for the facts, they contradict the philosophy, and are\r\nonly to be ignored with silent contempt. A French Academician's report\r\non the ventilation of a large public building, lately reprinted by the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, states with absolute assurance and exactness\r\nthe cubic feet of air changed per minute, with the precise volume and\r\nvelocity of its ascension, by burning a peck of coal at the bottom of\r\nthe trunk flue. No mention is made of the anemometer or any other\r\ngauge of the result asserted, and we are left to the suspicion that it\r\nis merely a matter of theoretical inference, as usual; for every one\r\nwho has had any acquaintance with practical tests in these matters\r\nknows that no such movement of air ever takes place under such\r\nconditions, unless by exceptional favor of the weather.\r\n\r\nI have seen a tall steam boiler chimney induce through a four inch\r\npipe a suction strong enough to exhaust the air from a large room as\r\nfast as perfect ventilation would require. But this, it is well known,\r\nrequires four hundred or five hundred degrees of heat in the chimney.\r\nI never saw an ordinary domestic fire of coals produce any noticeable\r\nventilating suction, without the use of a blower, urging the\r\ncombustion to fury, and I presume nobody else ever did.\r\n\r\nBut, while nobody ever saw an active suction of air produced by the\r\nmere heat of a still or unexcited fire--unless the _quantity_ of heat\r\nwere on a very large scale--everybody has seen a roaring current\r\nsucked through the narrowed throat of a chimney or a stove by a\r\nblazing handful of shavings, paper, or straw. It is very remarkable,\r\nwhen you come to think of it, that the burning of an insignificant\r\npiece of paper, with less heat in it, perhaps, than a pea of\r\nanthracite, will cause a rush of air that a bushel of anthracite\r\ncannot in the least degree imitate. It is not only a curious but a\r\nmost important fact. In short, it is _the cardinal_ fact on which\r\nventilation practically turns. But what is the nature of it? There are\r\nthree factors in the phenomenon. In the first place, the mechanical\r\npeculiarity of flame, or gas in the moment of combustion, as compared\r\nwith a gas like air merely heated, is _an almost explosive velocity of\r\nascent._ The physical peculiarity from which this results is the\r\nintensity of its heat--commonly stated at 2,000 degrees, as to our\r\ncommon illuminating gas--acting instantaneously throughout its mass,\r\njust as in gunpowder. The gas goes up the flue in its own flash, like\r\nthe ignited charge in the barrel of a gun: the burning coals can only\r\n_send_, and by a leisurely messenger, namely, the moderately heated\r\ngases, and contiguous air, that rise only by the gravitation or\r\npressure of the surrounding atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is not the small flame itself that roars in the chimney but\r\nthe rush of air induced by it. The semi-explosion of flame is but for\r\nan instant, though constantly renewed, and its explosive impulse\r\ncannot carry its light products of combustion very far through\r\nstationary and resistant air. It is _the induction of air_ carried\r\nwith it by such semi-explosive impulse (under proper mechanical\r\nconditions) that is strange to our observation and understanding, and\r\nis the second factor in the phenomenon we are accounting for and\r\npreparing to utilize.\r\n\r\nThe process, as it actually is, may be clearly exhibited by a very\r\nsimple means. Let anyone take a tube, say an inch in diameter--a roll\r\nof paper will do as well as anything--and, applying it closely to his\r\nmouth, try the whole force of his lungs through it upon any light\r\nobject. The amount of effect will be found surprisingly small; and\r\nunless the tube is a short one, it will be so far absorbed by friction\r\nand atmospheric resistance as to be almost imperceptible. Then let him\r\nhold the same tube near to the mouth, but not in contact, and repeat\r\nthe experiment. With the best adjustment, the effect may be described\r\nas tenfold or fifty-fold, or almost any fold--the effect of the simple\r\nblowing being merely nominal as compared with the induced current\r\nadded by blowing _into_ the tube instead of _in_ it. The blast enters\r\nthe free and open orifice with all the contiguous air which its\r\nsurface friction and the vacuum of its movement can involve in its\r\nrolling vortex. While the entrance is thus crowded with pressure, the\r\nexit is free; and the result at the exit is a blast of well sustained\r\nvelocity and _magnified volume;_ ready itself to repeat the miracle on\r\na still larger scale if provided with the apparatus for doing so. To\r\ntest this, now place a second and larger tube in such position as to\r\nprolong the first in a straight line, but with a slight interval\r\nbetween the meeting ends; so that the blast, as magnified in volume in\r\nentering the first tube, may enter in like manner the second tube and\r\nbe magnified again. With correct adjustments this experiment will\r\nprove more surprising than the first. Put on a third and still larger\r\ntube in the same way, and still larger surprise will meet a still\r\nlarger volume and force of blast, like a stiff breeze set in motion by\r\nthe puny effort of a single expiration. Of course, the prime impulse\r\nmust bear a certain proportion to the result; and the inductive or\r\ntractional friction of the initial blast, of flame or breath, will be\r\nused up at length unless re-enforced. In ventilating practice, there\r\n_is_ such re-enforcement, from an excess of gravity in the cooler\r\natmosphere outside the flue in which the flame is operating with its\r\nheat as well as its ascensional traction; so that there has been found\r\nno limit to the extensions and fresh inductions that may be added to\r\nthe first or trunk flue, with increase rather than diminution of power\r\nat every point. But the terms on which such extensions must be made\r\nhave been referred to in our illustration, and must be accurately\r\nascertained and observed. They constitute what is, in effect, the\r\nthird factor in the phenomenon of a roaring draught, and also,\r\ntherefore, ineffective ventilation. That is, the entering or induced\r\ncurrent of air must always find its channel of progress and exit\r\ncertain correct degrees larger than the opening by which it entered.\r\nEvery one knows that a stove or chimney wide open admits of but little\r\nsuction in connection with even the blaze of paper or shavings.\r\n\r\nThe mobility of air seems almost preternatural, when the proper\r\nconditions for setting a current in motion are supplied. But without a\r\ncurrent established, it is surprising in turn to find how obstinately\r\nand elusively immovable it can be. It is like tossing a feather; or\r\ntrying to drive a swarm of flies; dodging and evading every impulse\r\napplied. But, given a flue, to define and conduct a stream; an upright\r\nflue, to take advantage of the slighter gravity of the warmed air\r\nwithin it; and a flue contracted at the inlet and expanded as it\r\nrises, so as to free, diffuse, and lighten the column of air, toward\r\nthe exit; _then_, initiate an induced current of air at the inlet, by\r\nthe injection of a jet of gas in the state of semi-explosive action\r\ncalled flame; the pressure pushing upward from the crowded entrance\r\nfinds easier way and less resistance the farther it goes in the\r\nexpanding flue; the warmth and reduced gravity of the stream comes in\r\nas an auxiliary in overcoming friction and any exceptional obstruction\r\nin the state of the atmosphere; and now, as the ball is once set\r\nrolling, with a little _aid_ instead of resistance from gravitation,\r\nits initial impulse all the while sustained by the gas jet, and\r\nfriction reduced to a very small incident--there is nothing to prevent\r\nthe current rolling on with accelerated velocity (within the\r\nlimitations imposed by increasing friction) and rolling on forever. I\r\nmight, if I had time, add a curious consideration of the law of\r\n_vortex motion_ in elastic fluids, demonstrated by Helmholtz, which\r\nrelieves the motion of such fluids from friction, as wheels facilitate\r\nthe movement of a solid; and which also sucks into the rolling vortex\r\nthe contiguous air, thus entraining it, as we have seen, so much more\r\neffectively than could be done by a direct and rigid current, like a\r\njet of water, for instance. A wheel set in motion on an almost\r\nfrictionless bearing of metalline, runs without perceptible abatement\r\nof velocity, until one begins to involuntarily question whether it\r\nwill ever stop. In the all but free winds that roll with minimized\r\nfriction in the higher atmosphere, there seems to be a self-moving\r\nforce; so persistent is simple momentum in a mass so infinitesimally\r\nobstructed and so infinitely wheeled. An active current of air in a\r\nventilating flue is only less perfect in the same conditions; and so\r\nit is quite conceivable, and not incredible, that such a current may\r\nbe gradually established and thenceforward permanently maintained by a\r\nsmall motor flame barely more than enough to overbalance the minimized\r\nfriction. This is not a supposed or theoretically inferred fact, like\r\nthe facts of ventilation sometimes alleged by theorists. On the\r\ncontrary, the theory I have offered is merely an attempt to explain\r\nfacts that I have witnessed and that anyone can verify with the\r\nanemometer. But the _theory_ by no means covers the art and mystery of\r\nventilation; for ventilation is truly an _art_ as well as a mystery.\r\nThe art lies in a consummate experience of the sizes, proportions, and\r\nforms of flues, their inlets, expansions, and exits, with many other\r\nincidental adaptations necessary, in order to insure under _all_\r\ncircumstances the regular exhaustion of any specific volume of air\r\nrequired, per minute. And this art has by one man been achieved. It\r\nwould be a double injustice if I should neglect from any motive to\r\ninform my audience to whom I am indebted for what I know about\r\nventilation practically, and even for the knowledge that there is any\r\nsuch fact as a practicable ventilation of houses; one who is no\r\ntheorist, but who has felt his way experimentally with his own hands,\r\nfor a lifetime, to a practical mastery of the art to which I have\r\nattempted to fit a theory; every one present who is well informed on\r\nthis subject must have anticipated already in mind the name of Henry\r\nA. Gouge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECENT ERUPTION OF ETNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 20th of March, a long series of earthquakes\r\nspread alarm throughout all the cities and numerous villages that are\r\nscattered over the sides of Mt. Etna. The shocks followed each other\r\nat intervals of a few minutes; dull subterranean rumblings were heard;\r\nand a catastrophe was seen to be impending. Toward evening the ground\r\ncracked at the lower part of the south side of the mountain, at the\r\nlimit of the cultivated zone, and at four kilometers to the north of\r\nthe village of Nicolosi. There formed on the earth a large number of\r\nvery wide fissures, through which escaped great volumes of steam and\r\ngases which enveloped the mountain in a thick haze; and toward night,\r\na very bright red light, which, seen from Catania, seemed to come out\r\nin great waves from the foot of the mountain, announced the coming of\r\nthe lava.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERUPTION OF MOUNT ETNA, MARCH 22, 1883.]\r\n\r\nEleven eruptions occurred during the night, and shot into the air\r\nfiery scoriæ which, in a short time, formed three hillocks from forty\r\nto fifty meters in height. The jet of scoriæ was accompanied with\r\nstrong detonations, and the oscillations of the ground were of such\r\nviolence that the bells in the villages of Nicolosi and Pedara rang of\r\nthemselves. The general consternation was the greater in that the\r\nlocality in which the eruptive phenomena were manifesting themselves\r\nwas nearly the same as that which formed the theater of the celebrated\r\neruption of 1669. This locality overlooks an inclined plane which is\r\ngiven up to cultivation, and in which are scattered, at a short\r\ndistance from the place of the eruption, twelve villages having a\r\ntotal population of 20,000 inhabitants. On the second day the\r\ncharacter, of the eruption had become of a very alarming character.\r\nNew fissures showed themselves up to the vicinity of Nicolosi, and the\r\nlava flowed in great waves over the circumjacent lands. This seemed to\r\nindicate a lengthy eruption; but, to the surprise of those interested\r\nin volcanic phenomena, on the third day the eruptive movement began to\r\ndecrease, and, during the night, stopped entirely. This was a very\r\nfortunate circumstance, for this eruption would have caused immense\r\ndamages. It cannot be disguised, however, that the eruptive attendants\r\nof this conflagration remain under conditions such as to constitute a\r\npermanent danger for the neighboring villages. It has happened, in\r\nfact, that in consequence of the quick cessation of the eruption,\r\nthose secondary phenomena through which nature usually provides a\r\nsolid closing of the parasitic craters have not occurred. So it is\r\nprobable that when a new eruption takes place it will be at the same\r\npoint at which manifested itself the one that has just abated.--_La\r\nNature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICS WITHOUT APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTake an ordinary wine bottle and place it in front of and within a few\r\ninches of a lighted candle. Blow against the bottle with your mouth at\r\nabout four or six inches distant from it and in a line with the flame.\r\nVery curiously, notwithstanding the presence of the bottle and its\r\ninterception of the current of air, the candle will be immediately\r\nextinguished as if there were no obstacle in the way. This phenomenon\r\nis readily understood when we reflect that the bottle receives the\r\ncurrent of air on its polished surface and divides it into two, one of\r\nwhich is guided to the right and the other to the left. These two\r\ncurrents, after separating and driving back the surrounding air, meet\r\nagain at the very spot at which the flame is situated, and extinguish\r\nthe candle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODE OF EXTINGUISHING A CANDLE PLACED BEHIND A\r\nBOTTLE.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the experiment can be reproduced by putting the\r\ncandle behind a stove pipe, a cylinder of glass or metal, a\r\ncylindrical tin box, or any other object of the same form with a\r\ndiameter greater than that of a bottle, but not having a rough or\r\nangular surface, since the latter would cause the current to be lost\r\nin the surrounding air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAVELS OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome recent discussions of the constitution of the sun have turned in\r\npart upon what is known as the sun's proper motion in space. This is\r\none of the most surprising and interesting things that science has\r\never brought to light, and yet it is something of which comparatively\r\nfew persons have any knowledge. It is customary to look upon the sun\r\nas if it were the center of the universe, an immovable fiery globe\r\naround which the earth and other planets revolve while it remains\r\nfixed in one place. Nothing could be further from the truth. The sun\r\nis, in fact, the most wonderful of travelers. He is flying through\r\nspace at the rate of not less than a hundred and sixty millions of\r\nmiles in a year, and the earth and her sister planets are his fellow\r\nvoyagers, which, obeying his overpowering attraction, circle about him\r\nas he advances. In other words, if we could take up a position in open\r\nspace in advance of the sun, we should see him rushing toward us at\r\nthe rate of some 450,000 miles a day, chased by his whole family of\r\nshining worlds and the vast swarms of meteoric bodies which obey his\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\nThe general direction of this motion of the solar system has been\r\nknown since the time of Sir William Herschel. It is toward the\r\nconstellation Hercules, which, at this season, may be seen in the\r\nnortheastern sky at 9 o'clock in the evening. As the line of this\r\nmotion makes an angle of fifty odd degrees with the plane of the\r\nearth's orbit, it follows that the earth is not like a horse at a\r\nwindlass, circling around the sun forever in one beaten path, but like\r\na ship belonging to a fleet whose leader is continually pushing its\r\nprow into unexplored waters.\r\n\r\nThe path of the earth through space is spiral, so that it is all the\r\ntime advancing into new regions along with the sun. She is on a\r\nboundless voyage of discovery, and her human crew are born and die in\r\nwidely separated tracts of space. Think of the distance over which the\r\ntravels of the sun have borne the earth only since the beginning of\r\nhuman history! Six thousand years ago the earth and sun were about a\r\nmillion millions of miles further from the stars in Hercules than they\r\nare to-day. Columbus and his contemporaries lived when the earth was\r\nin a region of the universe more than sixty thousand millions of miles\r\nfrom the place where it is now, so that since his time the whole human\r\nrace has been making a voyage through space, in comparison with which\r\nhis longest voyage was as the footstep of a fly.\r\n\r\nThus the great events in the history of the world may be said to have\r\noccurred in different parts of the universe. An almost inconceivable\r\ndistance separates the spot which the earth occupied in the time of\r\nAlexander from that which it occupied when Cæsar invaded Gaul. The sun\r\nand the earth have wandered so far from their birthplace that the mind\r\nstaggers in the attempt to guess at the stupendous distance which now\r\nprobably separates them from it. It may be that the motion of the\r\nsolar system is orbital and that our sun and many of the stars, his\r\nfellow suns, are revolving around some common center, but if so, no\r\nmeans has yet been devised of detecting the form or dimensions of his\r\norbit. So far as we can see, the sun is moving in a straight line.\r\n\r\nSince space is believed to be filled with some sort of ethereal\r\nmedium, curious consequences are seen to follow from the motions that\r\nhave been described. A solid globe like the earth rushing at great\r\nspeed through such a medium will encounter some resistance. If the\r\nmedium be exceedingly rare, as it must be in fact, the resistance will\r\nbe correspondingly small, but still there will be resistance. If the\r\nsun stood still, the earth, owing to the inclination of its axis to\r\nthe plane of its orbit, around the sun, would encounter the resistance\r\nof the ether principally on its northern hemisphere from summer to\r\nwinter, and on its southern hemisphere from winter to summer. But in\r\nconsequence of the motion of the sun shared by the earth, this law of\r\ndistribution is changed, and from summer to winter the earth plows\r\nthrough the ether with its north pole foremost, while from winter to\r\nsummer, although the resistance of the ether is encountered more\r\nevenly by the two hemispheres, yet it is still felt principally in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, and the south pole remains practically protected.\r\nIt follows that the southern hemisphere, and particularly the south\r\npolar regions are more or less completely sheltered the whole year\r\naround. It might then be supposed that the impact of the particles of\r\nthe ether shouldered aside by the earth in its swift flight and the\r\ncompression produced in front of the advancing globe would tend to\r\nraise the temperature of the northern hemisphere as compared with the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, while the south pole, being more or less directly\r\nin the wake of the earth, and in a region of rarefaction of the ether,\r\nwould constantly possess a remarkably low temperature.\r\n\r\nNow, it is known that the south polar regions are more covered with\r\nice and snow than those of the north, and that the temperature there\r\nthe year around is lower. Whether this difference is owing to the\r\neffects of the earth's journey through the ether, is a question.\r\n\r\nThe sun, too, moves with his northern hemisphere foremost, and it is\r\nworthy of remark that it has been suspected that the northern\r\nhemisphere of the sun radiates more heat than the southern.\r\n\r\nBut whatever effect it may or may not have upon the meteorological\r\ncondition of the earth, the fact that the solar system is thus\r\nvoyaging through space is in itself exceedingly interesting. Not the\r\nwildest traveler's dream presents to the imagination such a voyage as\r\nthis on which every inhabitant of the earth is bound. A glance at a\r\nstar map shows that the direction in which we are going is carrying us\r\ntoward a region of the heavens exceedingly rich in stars, many, and\r\nperhaps most, of which are greater suns than ours. There can be little\r\ndoubt that when the sun arrives in the neighborhood of those stars, he\r\nwill be surrounded by celestial scenery very different from and much\r\nmore brilliant than that of the region of space in which he now is.\r\nThe inhabitants of the globe at that distant period will certainly\r\nbehold new and far more glorious heavens, though the earth may be\r\nunchanged.--_N.Y. Sun._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPAGATION OF MAPLE TREES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not presume that all people over three score years of age are so\r\nentirely ignorant as I am, but probably there are some. I have lived\r\nmore than sixty years almost in the woods, and I never observed, and\r\nnever heard any other person speak of, the blooming, seeding, and\r\nmaturing of the water maple. I have a beautiful low of water maple\r\nshade trees along the street in front of my house. In March, 1882, I\r\nobserved that they were in bloom, and many bees were swarming about\r\nthem. After the bees left them I noticed the seed (specimens inclosed\r\nof this spring's growth) in millions. As the leaves put out in April\r\nthe little knife blade seeds fell off, so thick as to almost cover the\r\nground. My grandson picked up three or four hatfuls, and I sent the\r\nseed to my farm and had them drilled in like wheat, when I planted\r\ncorn. The result is I have from 300 to 500 beautiful maples from 6\r\ninches to three feet high. I noticed the blooms again this spring, but\r\na cold snap killed the blooms, and only now and then can I find a\r\nseed. I had a sugar tree in my yard, which bloomed and bore seed which\r\ndid not fall off through the summer. My yard now has as many little\r\nsugar trees as it has leaves of blue grass.\r\n\r\nIt strikes me that the gathering and planting of maple seed is the\r\nbest way to wood the prairies of the West and the worn-out lands of\r\nthe Eastern and Middle States. The tree is valuable for shade and for\r\ntimber, and is as rapid in growth as any tree within my knowledge. I\r\nnoticed some trees of this sort yesterday which are from 2½ to 3½ feet\r\nin diameter. The lumber from such timber makes beautiful furniture.\r\nThis is intended only for those who have been as non-observant as\r\nmyself, and not the wise, who are always posted.\r\n\r\n                                       Franklin, Tenn.    J.B.M.\r\n\r\nThe seeds inclosed were the samaras of _Acer rubrum_, called the\r\n\"soft\" maple in many localities, and \"red\" maple in others. We have\r\nseen trees only three or four inches in diameter full of blossoms.\r\nThis is one of the earliest trees to bloom in spring, and the pretty\r\nwinged samaras soon mature and fall. The sugar maple, _Acer\r\nsaccharinum_, blossoms later, and the seeds are persistent till\r\nautumn, and lie on the ground all winter before germinating. The\r\nlumber from this latter is more valuable than soft maple, being\r\nharder, heavier, and taking a better polish. Soft maple makes an\r\nox-yoke which is durable and not heavy.

It has slender stems clothed with\r\ndistinctly veined leaves, and produces a profusion of creamy white\r\nfragrant flowers in pendulous clusters, as shown in the annexed\r\nengraving, for which we are indebted to Messrs Veitch of Chelsea, who\r\ndistributed the plant a few years ago. On several occasions Messrs\r\nVeitch have exhibited it trained parasol fashion and covered\r\nabundantly with elegant drooping clusters of flowers, and as such it\r\nhas been much admired. When planted out in a warmish greenhouse and\r\nallowed to twine at will around an upright pillar, it is seen to the\r\nbest advantage, and, though not showy, makes a pleasing contrast with\r\nother gayly tinted flowers. It is so unlike any other ornamental plant\r\nin cultivation, that it ought to become more widely known than it\r\nappears to be at present.--_The Garden._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAVAGES OF A RARE SCOLYTID BEETLE IN THE SUGAR MAPLES OF\r\nNORTHEASTERN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the first of last August (1882) I noticed that a large\r\npercentage of the undergrowth of the sugar maple (_Acer saccharinum_)\r\nin Lewis County, Northeastern New York, seemed to be dying The leaves\r\ndrooped and withered, and finally shriveled and dried, but still clung\r\nto the branches.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the plants affected were bushes a centimeter or two in\r\nthickness, and averaging from one to two meters in height, though a\r\nfew exceeded these dimensions. On attempting to pull them up they\r\nuniformly, and almost without exception, broke off at the level of the\r\nground, leaving the root undisturbed. A glance at the broken end\r\nsufficed to reveal the mystery, for it was perforated, both vertically\r\nand horizontally, by the tubular excavations of a little Scolytid\r\nbeetle which, in most instances, was found still engaged in his work\r\nof destruction.\r\n\r\nAt this time the wood immediately above the part actually invaded by\r\nthe insect was still sound, but a couple of months later it was\r\ngenerally found to be rotten. During September and October I dug up\r\nand examined a large number of apparently healthy young maples of\r\nabout the size of those already mentioned, and was somewhat surprised\r\nto discover that fully ten per cent. of them were infested with the\r\nsame beetles, though the excavations had not as yet been sufficiently\r\nextensive to affect the outward appearance of the bush. They must all\r\ndie during the coming winter, and next spring will show that, in Lewis\r\nCounty alone, hundreds of thousands of young sugar maples perished\r\nfrom the ravages of this Scolytid during the summer of 1882.\r\n\r\nDr. George H Horn, of Philadelphia, to whom I sent specimens for\r\nidentification, writes me that the beetle is _Corthylus\r\npunctatissimus_, Zim, and that nothing is known of its habits. I take\r\npleasure, therefore, in contributing the present account, meager as it\r\nis, of its operations, and have illustrated it with a few rough\r\nsketches that are all of the natural size, excepting those of the\r\ninsects themselves, which are magnified about nine diameters.\r\n\r\nThe hole which constitutes the entrance to the excavation is, without\r\nexception, at or very near the surface of the ground, and is\r\ninvariably beneath the layer of dead and decaying leaves that\r\neverywhere covers the soil in our Northern deciduous forests. Each\r\nburrow consists of a primary, more or less horizontal, circular canal,\r\nthat passes completely around the bush, but does not perforate into\r\nthe entrance hole, for it generally takes a slightly spiral course, so\r\nthat when back to the starting point it falls either a little above,\r\nor a little below it--commonly the latter (see Figs. 1 and 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 1 and 2--Mines of Corthylus\r\npunctatissimus.]\r\n\r\nIt follows the periphery so closely that the outer layer of growing\r\nwood, separating it from the bark, does not average 0.25 mm. in\r\nthickness, and yet I have never known it to cut entirely through this,\r\nso as to lie in contact with the bark.\r\n\r\nFrom this primary circular excavation issue, at right angles, and\r\ngenerally in both directions (up and down), a varying number of\r\nstraight tubes, parallel to the axis of the plant (see Figs. 1, 2, and\r\n3). They average five or six millimeters in length, and commonly\r\nterminate blindly, a mature beetle being usually found in the end of\r\neach. Sometimes, but rarely, one or more of those vertical excavations\r\nis found to extend farther, and, bending at a right angle, to take a\r\nturn around the circumference of the bush, thus constituting a second\r\nhorizontal circular canal from which, as from the primary one, a\r\nvarying number of short vertical tubes branch off. And in very\r\nexceptional cases these excavations extend still deeper, and there may\r\nbe three, or even four, more or less complete circular canals. Such an\r\nunusual state of things exists in the specimen from which Fig 3 is\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 3 and 4--Mines of Corthylus\r\npunctatissimus.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that with few exceptions, the most important of which\r\nis shown in Fig 4, all the excavations (including both the horizontal\r\ncanals and their vertical off shoots) are made in the sap-wood\r\nimmediately under the bark, and not in the hard and comparatively dry\r\ncentral portion. This is, doubtless, because the outer layers of the\r\nwood are softer and more juicy, and therefore more easily cut, besides\r\ncontaining more nutriment and being, doubt less, better relished than\r\nthe drier interior.\r\n\r\nThis beetle does not bore, like some insects, but devours bodily all\r\nthe wood that is removed in making its burrows. The depth of each\r\nvertical tube may be taken as an index to the length of time the\r\nanimal has been at work, and the number of these tubes generally tells\r\nhow many inhabit each bush, for as a general rule each individual\r\nmakes but one hole, and is commonly found at the bottom of it. All of\r\nthe excavations are black inside.\r\n\r\nThe beetle is sub-cylindric in outline, and very small, measuring but\r\n3.5 mm in length. Its color is a dark chestnut brown, some specimens\r\nbeing almost black. Its head is bent down under the thorax, and cannot\r\nbe seen from above (see Fig. 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 5.--Corthylus punctatissimus.]\r\n\r\nShould this species become abundant and widely dispersed, it could but\r\nexercise a disastrous influence upon the maple forests of the\r\nfuture--_G. Hart Merriam, M D, in American Naturalist._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED SPIDER.\r\n\r\n(_Tetranyehus telarius._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe red spider is not correctly speaking an insect, though it is\r\ncommonly spoken of as such, neither is it a spider, as its name would\r\nimply, but an acarus or mite. Whether its name is correct or not, it\r\nis a most destructive and troublesome pest wherever it makes its\r\npresence felt, it by no means confines itself to one or only a few\r\nkinds of plants, as many insects do, but it is very indiscriminate in\r\nits choice of food, and it attacks both plants grown under glass and\r\nthose in the open air. When these pests are present in large numbers,\r\nthe leaves on which they feed soon present a sickly yellow or scorched\r\nappearance, for the supply of sap is drawn off by myriads of these\r\nlittle mites, which congregate on the under sides of the leaves, where\r\nthey live in a very delicate web, which they spin, and multiply very\r\nrapidly; this web and the excrement of the red spider soon choke up\r\nthe pores of the leaves, which, deprived of their proper amount of\r\nsap, and unable to procure the carbon from the atmosphere which they\r\nso much need, are soon in a sorry plight. However promiscuous these\r\nmites may be in their choice of food plants--melons, cucumbers, kidney\r\nbeans, hops, vines, apple, pear, plum, peach trees, limes, roses,\r\nlaurustinus, cactuses, clover, ferns, orchids, and various stove and\r\ngreenhouse plants being their particular favorites--they are by no\r\nmeans insensible to the difference between dryness and moisture. To\r\nthe latter they have a most decided objection, and it is only in warm\r\nand dry situations that they give much trouble, and it is nearly\r\nalways in dry seasons that plants, etc., out of doors suffer most from\r\nthese pests. Fruit trees grown against walls are particularly liable\r\nto be attacked, since from their position the air round them is\r\ngenerally warm and dry, and the cracks and boles in the walls are\r\nfavorite places for the red spider to shelter in, so that extra care\r\nshould be taken to prevent them from being infested, this may best be\r\neffected by syringing the trees well night and morning with plain\r\nwater, directing the water particularly to the under sides of the\r\nleaves, so as, if possible, to wash off the spiders and their webs. If\r\nthe trees be already attacked, adding soft soap and sulphur to the\r\nwater will destroy them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1--Red Spider (magnified). A 1. Ditto\r\n(natural size). 2. Underside of head. 3. Foot. 4. Spinneret.]\r\n\r\nSulphur is one of the most efficient agents known for killing them,\r\nbut it will not, however, mix properly with water in its ordinary\r\nform, but should be teated according to the following recipe:\r\n\r\nBoil together in four gallons of water 1 lb. of flowers of sulphur and\r\n2 lb. of fresh lime, and add 1½ lb. of soft soap, and, before using, 3\r\ngallons more of water, or mix 4 oz of sulphate of lime with half that\r\nweight of soft soap, and, when well mixed, add 1 gallon of hot water.\r\nUse when cool enough to bear your hand in it. Any insecticide\r\ncontaining sulphur is useful. The walls should be well washed with\r\nsome insecticide of this kind. Old walls in which the pointing is bad\r\nand the bricks full of nail holes, etc., are very difficult to keep\r\nfree from red spider. They should be painted over with a strong\r\nsolution of soot water mixed with clay to form a paint. To a gallon of\r\nthis paint add 1 lb. of flowers of sulphur and 2 oz of soft soap.\r\n\r\nThis mixture should be thoroughly rubbed with a brush into every crack\r\nand crevice of the walls, and if applied regularly every year would\r\nprobably prevent the trees from being badly attacked. As the red\r\nspider passes the winter under some shelter, frequently choosing\r\nstones, rubbish, etc., near the roots of the trees, keeping the ground\r\nnear the trees clean and well cultivated will tend greatly to diminish\r\ntheir numbers. In vineries one of the best ways of destroying these\r\ncreatures is to paint the hot water pipes with one part of fresh lime\r\nand two parts of flowers of sulphur mixed into a paint. If a flue is\r\npainted in this way, great care should be taken that the sulphur does\r\nnot burn, or much damage may be done, as the flues may become much\r\nhotter than hot water pipes. During the earlier stages of growth keep\r\nthe atmosphere moist and impregnated with ammonia by a layer of fresh\r\nstable litter, or by painting the hot water pipes with guano made into\r\na paint, as long as the air in the house is kept moist there is not\r\nmuch danger of a bad attack. As soon as the leaves are off, the canes\r\nshould be dressed with the recipe already given for painting the\r\nwalls, and two inches or so of the surface soil removed and replaced\r\nwith fresh and all the wood and iron work of the house well scrubbed.\r\nIf carnations are attacked, tying up some flowers of sulphur in a\r\nmuslin bag and sulphuring the plants liberally, and washing them well\r\nin three days' time has been recommended.\r\n\r\nTobacco water and tobacco smoke will also kill these pests, but as\r\nneither tobacco nor sulphuring the hot water pipes can always be\r\nresorted to with safety in houses, by far the better way is to keep a\r\nsharp look out for this pest, and as soon as a plant is found to be\r\nattacked to at once clean it with an insecticide which it is known the\r\nplant will bear, and by this means prevent other plants from being\r\ninfested. These little mites breed with astonishing rapidity, so that\r\ngreat care should be exercised in at once stopping an attack. A lady\r\nfriend of mine had some castor oil plants growing in pots in a window\r\nwhich were badly attacked, and found that some lady-birds soon made\r\nshort work of the mites and cleared the plants. The red spider lays\r\nits eggs among the threads of the web which it weaves over the under\r\nsides of the leaves; the eggs are round and white; the young spiders\r\nare hatched in about a week, and they very much resemble their parents\r\nin general appearance, but they have only three pairs of legs instead\r\nof four at first, and they do not acquire the fourth pair until they\r\nhave changed their skins several times; they are, of course, much\r\nsmaller in size, but are, however, in proportion just as destructive\r\nas the older ones. They obtain the juices of the leaves by eating\r\nthrough the skin with their mandibles, and then thrusting in their\r\nprobosces or suckers (Fig. 2), through which they draw out the juices.\r\nThese little creatures are so transparent, that it is very difficult\r\nto make out all the details of their mouths accurately. The females\r\nare very fertile, and breed with great rapidity under favorable\r\ncircumstances all the year round.\r\n\r\nThe red spiders, as I have already stated, are not real spiders, but\r\nbelong to the family Acarina or mites, a family included in the same\r\nclass (the arachnida) as the true spiders, from which they may be\r\neasily distinguished by the want of any apparent division between the\r\nhead and thorax and body; in the true spiders the head and thorax are\r\nunited together and form one piece, to which the body is joined by a\r\nslender waist. The arachnidæ are followed by the myriapoda\r\n(centipedes, etc.), and these by the insectiæ or true insects. The red\r\nspiders belong to the kind of mites called spinning mites, to\r\ndistinguish them from those which do not form a web of any kind. It is\r\nnot quite certain at present whether there is only one or more species\r\nof red spider; but this is immaterial to the horticulturist, as their\r\nhabits and the means for their destruction are the same. The red\r\nspider (Tetranychus telarius--Fig. 1) is very minute, not measuring\r\nmore than the sixtieth of an inch in length when full grown; their\r\ncolor is very variable, some individuals being nearly white, others\r\ngreenish, or various shades of orange, and red. This variation in\r\ncolor probably depends somewhat on their age or food--the red ones are\r\ngenerally supposed to be the most mature. The head is furnished with a\r\npair of pointed mandibles, between which is a pointed beak or sucker\r\n(Fig. 2). The legs are eight in number; the two front pairs project\r\nforward and the other two backward; they are covered with long stiff\r\nhairs; the extremities of the feet are provided with long bent hairs,\r\nwhich are each terminated by a knob. The legs and feet appear to be\r\nonly used in drawing out the threads and weaving the web. The thread\r\nis secreted by a nipple or spinneret (Fig. 4) situated near the apex\r\nof the body on the under side. The upper surface of the body is\r\nsparingly covered with long stiff hairs.--_G.S.S., in The Garden._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HELODERMA HORRIDUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the curious lizard found in our Western Territories\r\nand in Mexico, and variously known as the \"Montana alligator,\" \"the\r\nGila monster,\" and \"the Mexican heloderma,\" is becoming decidedly\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nAs noted in a recent issue of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, a live specimen\r\nwas sent last summer to Sir John Lubbock, and by him presented to the\r\nLondon Zoological Gardens. At first it was handled as any other lizard\r\nwould be, without special fear of its bite, although its mouth is well\r\narmed with teeth. Subsequent investigation has convinced its keepers\r\nthat the creature is not a fit subject for careless handling; that its\r\nnative reputation is justified by fact; and that it is an exception\r\nto all known lizards, in that its teeth are poison fangs comparable\r\nwith those of venomous serpents.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Mexican reputation of the lizard, in a recent issue of\r\n_Knowledge_, Dr. Andrew Wilson, whose opinion will be respected by all\r\nnaturalists, says that \"without direct evidence of such a statement no\r\nman of science, basing his knowledge of lizard nature on the exact\r\nknowledge to hand, would have hesitated in rejecting the story as, at\r\nleast, improbable. Yet it is clear that the stories of the New World\r\nmay have had an actual basis of fact; for the _Heloderma horridum_ has\r\nbeen, beyond doubt, proved to be poisonous in as high a degree as a\r\ncobra or a rattlesnake.\r\n\r\n\"At first the lizard was freely handled by those in charge at Regent's\r\nPark, and being a lizard, was regarded as harmless. It was certainly\r\ndull and inactive, a result probably due to its long voyage and to the\r\nwant of food. Thanks, however, to the examination of Dr. Gunther, of\r\nthe British Museum, and to actual experiment, we now know that\r\n_Heloderma_ will require in future to be classed among the deadly\r\nenemies of other animals. Examining its mouth, Dr. Gunther found that\r\nits teeth formed a literal series of poison fangs. Each tooth,\r\napparently, possesses a poison gland; and lizards, it may be added,\r\nare plentifully supplied with these organs as a rule. Experimenting\r\nupon the virulence of the poison, _Heloderma_ was made to bite a frog\r\nand a guinea pig. The frog died in one minute, and the guinea-pig in\r\nthree. The virus required to produce these effects must be of\r\nsingularly acute and powerful nature. It is to be hoped that no case\r\nof human misadventure at the teeth of _Heloderma_ may happen. There\r\ncan be no question, judging from the analogy of serpent-bite, that the\r\npoison of the lizard would affect man.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HELODERMA HORRIDUM, OR GILA MONSTER]\r\n\r\nIn an article in the London _Field_, Mr. W.B. Tegetmeier states that\r\nthis remarkable lizard was first described in the _Isis_, in 1829, by\r\nthe German naturalist Wiegmann, who gave it the name it bears, and\r\nnoted the ophidian character of its teeth.\r\n\r\nIn the _Comptes Rendus_ of 1875, M.F. Sumichrast gave a much more\r\ndetailed account of the habits and mode of life of this animal, and\r\nforwarded specimens in alcohol to Paris, where they were dissected and\r\ncarefully described. The results of these investigations have been\r\npublished in the third part of the \"Mission Scientifique an Mexique,\"\r\nwhich, being devoted to reptiles, has been edited by Messrs. Aug.\r\nDumeril and Becourt.\r\n\r\nThe heloderm, according to M.F. Sumichrast, inhabits the hot zone of\r\nMexico--that intervening between the high mountains and the Pacific in\r\nthe districts bordering the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It is found only\r\nwhere the climate is dry and hot; and on the moister eastern slopes of\r\nthe mountain chain that receive the damp winds from the Gulf of Mexico\r\nit is entirely unknown. Of its habits but little is known, as it\r\nappears to be, like many lizards, nocturnal, or seminocturnal, in its\r\nmovements, and, moreover, it is viewed with extreme dread by the\r\nnatives, who regard it as equally poisonous with the most venomous\r\nserpents. It is obviously, however, a terrestrial animal, as it has\r\nnot a swimming tail flattened from side to side, nor the climbing feet\r\nthat so characteristically mark arboreal lizards. Sumichrast further\r\nstates that the animal has a strong nauseous smell, and that when\r\nirritated it secretes a large quantity of gluey saliva. In order to\r\ntest its supposed poisonous property, he caused a young one to bite a\r\npullet under the wing. In a few minutes the adjacent parts became\r\nviolet in color, convulsions ensued, from which the bird partially\r\nrecovered, but it died at the expiration of twelve hours. A large cat\r\nwas also caused to be bitten in the foot by the same heloderm; it was\r\nnot killed, but the limb became swollen, and the cat continued\r\nmewing for several hours, as if in extreme pain. The dead specimens\r\nsent to Europe have been carefully examined as to the character of the\r\nteeth. Sections of these have been made, which demonstrate the\r\nexistence of a canal in each, totally distinct from and anterior to\r\nthe pulp cavity; but the soft parts had not been examined with\r\nsufficient care to determine the existence or non-existence of any\r\npoison gland in immediate connection with these perforated teeth until\r\nDr. Gunther's observations were made, as described by Dr. Wilson.\r\n\r\nHitherto, as noted in a previous article, American naturalists have\r\nregarded the heloderm as quite harmless--an opinion well sustained by\r\nthe judgment of many persons in Arizona and other parts of the West by\r\nwhom the reptile has been kept as an interesting though ugly pet.\r\nWhile the Indians and native Mexicans believe the creature to be\r\nvenomous, we have never heard an instance in which the bite of it has\r\nproved fatal.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, \"C.E.J.,\" writing from\r\nSalt Lake City, Utah, under date of September 8, says, after referring\r\nto the article on the heloderm in our issue of August 26:\r\n\r\n  \"Having resided in the southern part of this Territory for\r\n  seventeen years, where the mercury often reaches 110° or more in\r\n  the shade, and handled a number of these 'monsters,' I can say\r\n  that I never yet knew anybody or anything to have perished from\r\n  their bite. We have often had two or three of them tied in the\r\n  door-yard by a hind leg, and the children have freely played\r\n  around them--picking them up by the nape of the neck and watching\r\n  them snap off a small bit from the end of a stick when poked at\r\n  them. We have fed them raw egg and milk; the latter they take with\r\n  great relish. At one time a small canine came too near the mouth\r\n  of our alligator (_mountain alligator_, we call them), when it\r\n  instantly caught the pup by the under jaw and held on as only it\r\n  could (they have a powerful jaw), nor would it release its hold\r\n  until choked near to death, which was done by taking it behind the\r\n  bony framework of the head, between the thumb and finger, and\r\n  pressing hard. The pup did considerable howling for half an hour,\r\n  by which time the jaw was much swollen, remaining so for two or\r\n  three days, after which it was all right again. By this I could\r\n  only conclude that the animal was but slightly poisonous. I never\r\n  knew of a human being having been bitten by one. My sister kept\r\n  one about the house for several weeks, and fed it from her hands\r\n  and with a spoon. The specimens have generally been sent (through\r\n  the Deseret Museum) to colleges and museums in the East.\r\n\r\n  \"The Indians have a great fear that these animals produce at will\r\n  good or bad weather, and will not molest them. Many times they\r\n  have come to see them, and told us that we should let them go or\r\n  they would talk to the storm spirit and send wind and water and\r\n  fire upon us. An old Indian I once talked with told me of another\r\n  who was bitten on the hand, and said it swelled up the arm badly,\r\n  but he recovered. From some reason we never find specimens less\r\n  than 12 or 14 inches long, I never saw a young one. There is a\r\n  nice stuffed specimen, 18 inches long, in our museum here.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock's specimen, shown in the engraving herewith, for\r\nwhich we are indebted to the London _Field_, is about 19 inches in\r\nlength. Its general color is a creamy buff, with dark brown markings.\r\nThe forepart of the head and muzzle is entirely dark, the upper eyelid\r\nbeing indicated by a light stripe. The entire body is covered with\r\ncircular warts. It is fed upon eggs, which it eats greedily.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know whether the northern specimens, if\r\nvenomous at all, are as fully equipped with poison bags and fangs as\r\nDr. Gunther finds the Mexican specimen to be. Some of our Western or\r\nMexican readers may be able to make comparative tests. Meantime it\r\nwould be prudent to limit the use of the \"monster\" as a children's\r\npet.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing appeared in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN of Oct. 7, 1882.\r\n\r\nWe are now indebted to a correspondent, Mr. Wm. Y. Beach, of the Grand\r\nView Mine, Grant County, Southern Arizona, for a fine specimen of this\r\nsingular reptile, just received alive. The example sent to us is about\r\ntwenty inches long, and answers very well to the description of the\r\nmonster and the engraving above given.\r\n\r\nIn the course of an hour after opening the box in which the reptile\r\nhad been confined during its eight days' journey by rail, it became\r\nvery much at home, stretching and crawling about our office floor with\r\nmuch apparent satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOur correspondent is located in the mountains, some nine miles distant\r\nfrom the Gila River. He states that the reptile he sends was found in\r\none of the shops pertaining to the mine, which had been left\r\nunoccupied for a week or so.\r\n\r\nApropos to the foregoing, we have received the following letter from\r\nanother correspondent in Arizona:\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American:_\r\n\r\n  My attention has been called to an article in your issue of Oct.\r\n  7, 1882, relating to the _Heloderma horridum_, or commonly known\r\n  as the Gila Monster.\r\n\r\n  During a residence of ten years in Arizona I have had many\r\n  opportunities of learning the habits of these reptiles, and I am\r\n  satisfied their bite will produce serious effects, if not death,\r\n  of the human race. I know of one instance where a gentleman of my\r\n  acquaintance by the name of Bostick, at the Tiga Top mining camp,\r\n  in Arizona, was bitten on the fingers, and suffered all the\r\n  symptoms of poison from snake bite. He was confined to his bed for\r\n  six weeks and subsequently died. I am of the opinion his death was\r\n  in part caused by the effects of the poison of the Gila Monster.\r\n\r\n  The Hualzar Indians are very much afraid of them, and one I showed\r\n  the picture to of the Monster in your paper remarked, \"Chinamuck,\"\r\n  which in Hualzar language means \"very bad.\" He said if an Indian\r\n  is bitten, he sometimes dies.\r\n\r\n  I have seen them nearly two feet in length. Never, to my\r\n  knowledge, are they kept as pets in our portion of Arizona.

The learned professor in question asserted that\r\nit did not so grow upon the teat; but, with all due respect to the\r\nprofessor's claim to credibility on other matters, I must in this\r\ninstance take the liberty of stating that he is in error. The young\r\nkangaroo actually oozes out, if I may use such an expression, from the\r\nteat. Strange as the statement may seem, it is a fact that the first\r\nindication of life on the part of the kangaroo offspring is a very\r\nslight eruption, in size not larger than an ordinary pin head. This\r\ngrowth gradually resolves itself into the form of the marsupial, and\r\nis not detached until close upon the expiring of of the fourth month.\r\nIt is carried by the mother during that period, and thenceforth exists\r\npartially at least on herbage. Indeed, from the fourth till the\r\nseventh month it is almost constantly in the pouch, only coming out\r\noccasionally toward the close of evening to crop the grass. I had at\r\none time in my possession a specimen of the kangaroo germ which I cut\r\nfrom off the teat, complete in form, whose entire weight was less than\r\nan ounce; and, at the same time, I had a kangaroo in my possession\r\nwhich measured seven feet six inches from the top of the ears to the\r\nextremity of the tail.\r\n\r\nYour readers would doubtless feel interested with a few particulars as\r\nto my life among the kangaroos in a genuine kangaroo country. I have\r\nread somewhere about the exceeding beauty of the eyes of the gazelle;\r\nhow noted hunters have alleged that their nature so softened on\r\nlooking into the animal's eyes that they (the hunters) had no heart to\r\ndestroy the creature. Now, I have never seen a gazelle, and so cannot\r\nindulge in comparisons; but if their eyes are more beautiful than\r\nthose of a middle-aged kangaroo, they may indeed be all that huntsmen\r\nsay of them. With respect to the old kangaroos, their eyes and face\r\nare simply atrocious in their repulsive ugliness.\r\n\r\nNothing in nature could surpass the affection which the female\r\nkangaroo manifests for her young. There is something absolutely\r\ntouching in the anxious solicitude displayed by the dam while the\r\nyoung ones are at play. On the least alarm the youngster instantly\r\nensconces himself in the pouch of his gentle mother, and should he, in\r\nthe exuberance of his joy, thrust his head out from his place of\r\nrefuge, it is instantly thrust back by his dam. I have, on several\r\noccasions, by hard riding, pressed a doe to dire extremity, and it has\r\nonly been when hope had entirely forsaken her, or when her capture was\r\ninevitable, that she has reluctantly thrown out the fawn. Their method\r\nof warfare has often reminded me of the style of two practiced\r\npugilists, the aim of each being to firmly gripe his opponent by the\r\nshoulder, upon accomplishing which, the long hind leg, with its horny\r\nblade projecting from its toe, comes into formidable play. It is\r\nlifted and drawn downward with a rapid movement, and one or other of\r\nthe combatants soon shows the entrails laid bare, which is usually the\r\n_grand finale_. The sparring that takes place between the marsupials\r\nwhile trying to get the advantageous gripe is marvelous--I had almost\r\nsaid scientific; for the style and rapidity of the animals' movements\r\nmight excite the admiration of the Tipton Slasher.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, these animals have their social distinctions almost\r\nas well defined as in the case of the human species. Thus, one herd\r\nwill not, on any consideration, associate with another; each tribe has\r\nits rendezvous for morning and evening reunions, and each its leader\r\nor king, who is the first to raise an alarm on the approach of danger,\r\nand the first to lead the way, whether in ignominious retreat,\r\nconfronting a recognized foe, or standing at bay. These leaders are\r\ngenerally extremely cunning, one old stager with whom I was intimately\r\nacquainted having baffled all attempts to effect its capture for more\r\nthan ten months. I got him at last by a stratagem. He had a knack of\r\nalways keeping near a flock of sheep, and on the approach of the dogs\r\ndodged among them.\r\n\r\nBy this means he had always succeeded in effecting his escape, and\r\nmore than that, this noble savage had actually drowned several of our\r\nbest dogs, for, if at any time a dog came upon him at a distance from\r\nthe sheep flocks, he would make for a neighboring swamp, on nearing\r\nwhich he has been known to turn round upon the pursuing dog, seize\r\nhim, and carry him for some distance right into the swamp, and then\r\nthrust the dog's head under water, holding him there till he was\r\ndrowned. It was amusing to see how some of our old knowing warrior\r\ndogs gave him best when they noticed that he was approaching a flock\r\nof sheep, well remembering, from former experience, that it was of no\r\nuse trying to get him on that occasion, and that when near the water\r\nthe attempt at his capture was both dangerous and impracticable.\r\n\r\nIf you take a new and inexperienced dog into your hunt after an old\r\nman, he invariably gets his throat ripped up, or is otherwise\r\nmaltreated until well used to the sport. After a dog has had one\r\nseason's experience he becomes a warrior, and it is a wonderfully\r\nclever kangaroo that can scratch him after he has attained that\r\nposition. The young recruit, if we may so speak of a dog who has never\r\nhad any practice, is over-impetuous, rushing into the treacherous\r\nembraces of the close hugger somewhat unadvisedly, and is fortunate if\r\nhe escapes with his life as a penalty for his rashness. The dog of\r\nexperience always gripes his marsupial adversary by the butt end of\r\nthe tail, close to the rump, or at its juncture with the spinal\r\nvertebræ. Once the dog has thrown his kangaroo, he makes for the\r\nthroat, which he gripes firmly, while at the same time he is careful\r\nto keep his own body as far as he conveniently can from the quarry's\r\ndangerous hind quarters. In this position dog and kangaroo work round\r\nand round for some time until one or the other of the combatants is\r\nexhausted. It is noteworthy that the kangaroo will only make use of\r\nits sharp teeth in cases of the direst extremity. On such occasions,\r\nhowever, it must be conceded that the bite is one of a most formidable\r\ncharacter--one not to be any means underrated or despised.\r\n\r\nShould those few incidents prove of sufficient interest in your\r\nestimation, I may state that I shall willingly, at some future time,\r\nforward you particulars of the \"ways peculiar\" of the emirs,\r\nbandicoots, wombats, opossums, and other remarkable animals, the\r\nobservance of which formed almost my sole amusement during a rather\r\nlengthy sojourn in the bush of South Australia.\r\n\r\nSEPTIMUS FREARSON.\r\n\r\nAdelaide, S.A., April, 1883.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE PEPPERMINT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn more than one periodical the botanical name of this plant has been\r\ngiven as Mentha arvensis, var. purpurascens. It will be well,\r\ntherefore, to point out that this is an error before the statement is\r\nfurther copied and the mistake perpetuated. The plant has green\r\nfoliage, with not a trace of purple, and less deserves the name\r\npurpurascens than the true peppermint (Mentha piperita), of which a\r\npurplish leaved form is well known. The mistake probably arose in the\r\nfirst place in a printer's error. The history is as follows:\r\n\r\nFor some years past a large quantity of a substance called menthol has\r\nbeen imported into this country, and extensively used as a topical\r\napplication for the relief of neuralgia, and in some instances as an\r\nantiseptic. This substance in appearance closely resembles Epsom\r\nsalts, and consists of crystals deposited in the oil of peppermint\r\ndistilled from the Japanese peppermint plant. This oil, when separated\r\nfrom the crystals, is now largely used to flavor cheap peppermint\r\nlozenges, being less expensive than the English oil. The crystals\r\ndeposit naturally in the oil upon keeping, but the Japanese extract\r\nthe whole of it by submitting the oil several times in succession to a\r\nlow temperature, when all the menthol crystallizes out from the oil\r\nand falls to the bottom of the vessel. The source of the Japanese\r\npeppermint oil has been stated to be Mentha arvensis, var. javanica.\r\nOn examining several specimens of this plant in our national herbaria\r\nI found that the leaves tasted like those of the common garden mint\r\n(Mentha viridis), and not at all like peppermint, and that therefore\r\nthe oil and menthol could not possibly be derived from this plant.\r\n\r\nI then asked my friend, Mr. T. Christy, who takes great interest in\r\nmedicinal plants, to endeavor to get specimens from Japan of the plant\r\nyielding the oil. After many vain attempts, he at last succeeded in\r\nobtaining live plants. These were cultivated in his garden at Malvern\r\nHouse, Sydenham, and when they flowered I examined the plant and found\r\nthat it differed from other forms of M. arvensis in the taste, in the\r\nacuminate segments of the calyx of the flower, and in the longer leaf\r\nstalks; the leaves also taper more toward the base. Dr. Franchet, the\r\ngreatest living authority on Japanese plants, to whom I sent\r\nspecimens, confirmed my opinion as to the variety deserving a special\r\nname, and M. Malinvaud, a well known authority on mints, suggested the\r\nname piperascens, which I adopted, calling the plant Mentha arvensis,\r\nvar. piperascens. Specimens of the plant kindly lent by Mr. Christy\r\nfor the purpose were exhibited by me at an evening meeting of the\r\nLinnæan Society, and by a printer's error in the report of the remarks\r\nthen made, the name of the plant appeared in print as Mentha arvensis,\r\nvar. purpurascens.\r\n\r\nI trust that the present note, through the medium of _The Garden_,\r\nwill prevent the perpetuation of this error. This is the more\r\nimportant, as I hope that the plant will come into cultivation in this\r\ncountry. It is a robust plant of rapid growth, as easily cultivated as\r\nthe English peppermint, and seems to require less moisture, and is\r\ntherefore capable of cultivation in a great variety of localities. The\r\nincreasing demand for menthol, which can only be procured in small\r\nquantities from the English peppermint, and the high price of English\r\npeppermint oil, lead to the hope that instead of importing menthol\r\nfrom Japan, it will be prepared in this country from the Japanese\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nWith the appliances of more advanced civilization, it ought to be\r\npossible for the oil and menthol to be made in this country at less\r\nprice than the Japanese products now cost.\r\n\r\nAt the present time large quantities of cheap peppermint oil are\r\nimported into this country from the United States, and Chinese oil is\r\nimported into Bombay for use in the Government medical stores. There\r\nis no reason why this should be the case if the Japanese plant were\r\ncultivated in this country. In Ireland, where labor is cheap and the\r\nclimate moist, this crop might afford a valuable source of income to\r\nenterprising cultivators. It may be interesting to note here that the\r\nplant used in China closely resembles the Japanese one, differing\r\nchiefly in the narrower and more glabrous leaves. I have therefore\r\nnamed it Mentha arvensis f. glabrata, from specimens sent to me from\r\nHong Kong, by Mr. C. Ford, the director of the Botanic Gardens there.\r\n\r\nE.M.

In October they will have ripened off,\r\nand must be taken out of the soil and stored in paper bags in a dry\r\nroom secure from frost. They will have made little bulbs, from the\r\nsize of a hazel nut downward, according to their vigor. In the\r\nsubsequent spring they should be planted like the old bulbs, and the\r\nlarger ones will flower during the season, while the smaller specimens\r\nmust be again harvested and planted out as above described.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA catalogue containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at\r\nthis office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\nScientific American Supplement.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\n      Terms of Subscription, $5 a Year.\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the\r\nUnited States or Canada.
