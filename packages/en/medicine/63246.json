_Fellare_).\r\n\r\n\r\nVery much more abominable and repulsive still is the habit of\r\nIrrumation[1] (_penem in os arrigere est irrumare_—to erect the _penis_\r\nand insert it into the mouth of another person) and the practice of\r\nthe _Fellator_[2] (_si quis vel labris vel lingua perfricandi atque\r\nexsugendi officium peni praestat_—one who with the lips or the tongue\r\nperforms the office of rubbing and sucking another’s _penis_). This the\r\nGreeks called λεσβιάζειν (to follow the Lesbian mode), because the vice\r\nwas especially practised by the Lesbian women, though in common with\r\nall others of the sort it came originally from Asia. _Lucian_ in his\r\n_Pseudologista_[3], in which he severely criticizes the the dissolute\r\nTimarchus, who had taken the expression ἀποφρὰς (unmentionable) in ill\r\npart, says: “By the gods, what should make you fly into a passion,\r\nsince it is a matter of common report that you are a _Fellator_ and\r\na _Cunnilingus_[4]. Are you as much in the dark as to the meaning\r\nof these words as you are about that of ἀποφρὰς (unmentionable)? and\r\ndo you take them for titles of honour? Or is it that you are now\r\naccustomed to them, but not to ἀποφρὰς, and so wish to erase it as\r\nsomething unknown to you from the list of your Titles? (ch. 28).—I\r\nam well aware what were your practices in Palestine, in Egypt, in\r\nPhoenicia and Syria, as well as in Hellas and Italy, and above all\r\njust now in Ephesus, where you set the crown on your extravagances,\r\n(ch. 11).—However you will never persuade your fellow-citizens that\r\nthey ought not to regard you as the filthiest of all men, the very\r\nrefuse of the whole city. Now it may be you rely on the belief of the\r\ngenerality in Syria, that you have never been accused (there) of any\r\nguilt or vice. But by Hercules! the city of Antioch looked on at the\r\nwhole history, when you carried off the young man who came from Tarsus,\r\nand—but there, it would not become me to go over such ground again.\r\nAll who were there know the facts and remember it all, that time when\r\nthey saw you sitting at his knees (καὶ σὲ μὲν ἐς γόνυ συγκαθήμενον\r\nἰδόντες), and doing you know very well what to him, that is if you have\r\nnot utterly and entirely forgotten the whole matter, (ch. 20).—But\r\nwhen they caught you lying at the knees of the son of Oinopion the\r\nCooper (τοῦ μειρακίου ... ἐν γόνασι κείμενον—lying at the knees of the\r\nstripling), what make you of that? Did they not surely take you for a\r\nman of the sort to be expected, when they saw you doing such a thing?\r\n(ch. 28).—How, by Zeus! after such a deed, have you the effrontery to\r\ngive us the kiss of salutation?—Sooner kiss an adder or a viper? The\r\ndanger and pain of the bite a Physician may yet remove, if called in.\r\nBut after your kiss and with such poison on his lips who dare draw\r\nnear to Temple or altar? What god would listen to the suppliant? how\r\nmany vessels of holy water, how many lustrations, would be needful?\r\n(ch. 24).—In Syria you are known as ῥοδοδάφνη (rose-laurel)[5]; why, a\r\nman cannot explain for very shame, great Athené!—But in Palestine as\r\nφραγμὸς (the hedge)[6], on account of the prickles of your beard, I\r\nsuppose. In Egypt again as συνάγχη (sore throat),—and this is a well\r\nknown business. It must have been a close thing with you not to be\r\nchoked, that time you came across the sailor of a three-master, who\r\nfell upon you and stopped your mouth for you (ὃς ἐμπεσὼν ἀπέφραξέ σοι\r\nτὸ στόμα).”\r\n\r\nThis passage brings us next to a gloss of the _Pseudo-Galen_[7], on\r\nwhich _Naumann_[8], after laying down his view as to the _Morbus\r\nphoeniceus_ (Purple Plague),—a subject to be discussed presently,—goes\r\non to express himself thus: “However we must go yet farther. In the\r\nabove cited work of the Pseudo-Galen is included an Index of words,\r\n_which with a high degree of probability we may conclude to refer to\r\nVenereal diseases, so far as known to the Ancients_ (loco citato,\r\nunder word στρυμάργου, p. 142). We read there that _Dioscorides_\r\ncalled στρυμάργους or στομάργους (evil-mouthed) men in whom the\r\nlonging for sensual indulgence had risen to frenzy. Of similar meaning\r\nto this would seem to be the expressions μυοχάνη (_maxillarum hiatu\r\ninsignis_—conspicuous for the wide opening of the arm-pits) or μυσάχνη\r\n(_meretrix_—prostitute), μῦσος (_facinus abominandum_—an abominable\r\nact), σαράπους (crura ambulando divaricans—straddling the legs in\r\nwalking), and γρυπαλώπηξ (from γρύπος _curvus_—curved, hooked,)\r\nprobably denoting the erection of the _penis_; at any rate a dissolute\r\nman is called in Aristophanes κυναλώπηξ (fox-dog). But most notable\r\nis the added observation, to the effect that Erasistratus called such\r\npersons ῥινοκολοῦροι (_i. e._ _qui mutilati naribus sunt_—men who\r\nhave been mutilated in their noses). Just at the time of the Greek\r\noccupation of Egypt, _Rhinocorura_ or _Rhinocolura_ was the name of a\r\nwretched sort of “Botany Bay” situated at the North-Eastern extremity\r\nof the country, lying in the desert on the shores of the Mediterranean\r\nbetween Gaza and Pelusium, and serving as a place of residence for\r\nlepers (_Pliny_, Hist. Nat., Bk. V. ch. 4. _Livy_, Hists. Bk. XXXV.\r\nch. 11). Now if we bring together all the information given here, and\r\nespecially if we consider the various shameful forms of indulgence of\r\nthe sexual impulse and the mutilation of the nose that is connected\r\nwith them, _there cannot be much doubt left that these ancient and\r\nfragmentary notices refer to Venereal evil_, whether in conjunction\r\nwith leprous affections or not.”\r\n\r\nBut to test the correctness of these explanations and conclusions,\r\nit will be necessary first of all to quote the gloss itself in full:\r\n_στρυμάργου._ οἶδε καὶ ταύτην τὴν γραφὴν ὁ Διοσκουρίδης, οὐ μόνον τὴν\r\n_στομάργου_, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῦτο οὐχ ὡς κύριον ὄνομα ἐξηγεῖται, ἀλλὰ τὸν\r\nμανικῶς ἐπτοημένον περὶ τὰ ἀφροδίσια δηλοῦσθαί φησιν· εἰρῆσθαι γὰρ παρὰ\r\nτῷ Ἱπποκράτει καὶ ἀλλὰ πολλὰ κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον ἐπίθετα, καθάπερ\r\n_μυοχάνη, σαράπους, γρυπαλώπηξ_· ἀλλὰ καὶ παρ’ Ἐρασιστράτῳ φησὶν ὁ\r\n_ῥινοκολοῦρος_, that is to say:—στρυμάργου: Dioscorides knows this\r\nform also, not merely that of στομάργου, but this too he regards not\r\nas a proper name, but says that it signifies one who is madly set upon\r\nlove-indulgences; for that in Hippocrates as well many other epithets\r\nof the same sort (which refer to the same sort of vice) are mentioned,\r\ne. g. μυοχάνη, σαράπους, γρυπαλώπηξ; also he says that in Erasistratus\r\n(the expression) ῥινοκολοῦρος is found.\r\n\r\nThe reader sees in the first place that it is not merely expressions\r\npeculiar to Dioscorides that are here cited, as we might be led to\r\nsuppose by Naumann’s statement, but that they are every one of them\r\nfound, as we shall presently prove more particularly, in _Hippocrates_,\r\nthe ῥινοκολοῦρος of Erasistratus of course excepted. _Dioscorides_\r\nmentions them only in his commentary on the Second Book of the\r\n“Epidemia”, when laying down the passages to be cited immediately, and\r\ndeclares them not to be proper names, but adjectives which all refer\r\nto insane indulgence in the pleasures of love; accordingly there can\r\nbe no question here of _bodily disorders_, let the words in themselves\r\nsignify what they will. Now if we examine into this more closely, we\r\nshall find first of all that we must obviously read στυμάργου in place\r\nof στρυμάργου, for not only is this form given by the author of the\r\ngloss (under στομάργου[9]), quoted on the preceding page, but the text\r\nalso of Hippocrates[10] offers it in both passages; whereas στρυμάργου\r\ngives no sort of sense.\r\n\r\nThe word στυμάργος in fact is derived either from στῦμα[11], the act\r\nof erecting the penis, and and ἔργον (work), so signifying anyone\r\nwho performs the work of causing an erection of the penis,—or else\r\nfrom στύω[12], I erect the penis, and μάργος[13], (mad), i. e.\r\none who erects, uses, the penis in a madly lascivious fashion, so\r\nan _Irrumator_, and with this _Hesychius’_ interpretation agrees:\r\nλεσβιάζειν,—πρὸς ἀνδρὸς στόμα στύειν, (to lesbianize,—to erect the\r\npenis in a man’s mouth). Στομάργος on the other hand is formed by a\r\ncombination of στόμα, the mouth, and ἔργω or ἔργον (I work, work),\r\na word constantly used to express the employment of the genital\r\norgans[14], in fact indulgence in love generally, and signifies a man\r\nwho performs the work (of love) with the mouth, so a _Fellator_[15].\r\nNow since only the most abandoned lust, lust that has really grown\r\ninto a form of insanity, is capable of undertaking such obscenities,\r\nthe interpretation of _Dioscorides_ μανικῶς ἐπτοημένον περὶ τὰ\r\nἀφροδίσια (one that is insanely, madly, set on the pleasures of love)\r\nis quite satisfactory, assuming a hesitation on the part of the author\r\nto set forth the actual fact more explicitly, especially as we have\r\nalready proved under the head of Paederastia[16] how unnatural sexual\r\ndesires were commonly regarded as a _Mania_ or form of insanity. Even\r\nif we were not in a position adequately to explain the rest of the\r\nwords, yet the phrase that comes next to them καὶ ἄλλα πολλὰ κατὰ τὸν\r\nαὐτὸν τρόπον (and many others of the same fashion) at once shows that\r\nthey bear the same signification as στύμαργος and στομάργος, or at any\r\nrate that they must all alike refer to unnatural satisfaction of the\r\nsexual impulse, for τρόπος (fashion) is the very word particularly\r\nappropriated to imply such-like practices, as we see from the\r\nexpressions Κρῆτα τρόπον, Ἑλληνικὸν τρόπον[17], (Cretan fashion, Greek\r\nfashion) used to indicate paederastia.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the word μυοχάνη the readings differ greatly in the\r\ndifferent MSS. of Galen. Franz in his edition of the Glossaries to\r\nHippocrates gives μιοχάνης and μυοχάνης, while the Pseudo-Galen\r\nexplains it under the word μυοχάνη as ἐπίθετον χασκούσης· εἰ δὲ\r\n_μυριοχαύνη_ γράφοιτο, ἡ ἐπὶ μυρίοις ἂν εἴη χαυνουμένη (epithet applied\r\nto a woman who gapes; now if _μυριοχαύνη_ were read, it would mean “the\r\nwoman who gapes wide for ten thousand men”); besides, various readings\r\nare found here,—μηοχάνη for μυοχάνη, also μιριοχάνη, and μυιοχάνη\r\nfor μυριοχαύνη. Erotian says μηριοχάνη ὄνομα γυναικὸς (Meriochané—a\r\nwoman’s name). In the text of Hippocrates[18] is found Μυριοχαύνη,\r\nand the same form is given by the editions of Galen[19]. Inasmuch as\r\nχάνω and χαύνω both have the same meaning of gaping wide, that is with\r\nthe mouth, it will practically make no difference which we choose as\r\nthe end of the word; hence we have merely to consider the first part\r\nμου- or μυριο-, all the rest of the forms being obviously erroneous.\r\nIf we read μουχάνη, we must suppose it compounded of μύος and χάνη;\r\nbut inasmuch as μύος is merely a mistaken variant for μῦσος, the word\r\nmust be read μυσοχάνη. Μῦσος in its turn we must derive either from\r\nμύζω, I suck,—so a woman who sucks with open mouth[20], or from μυσιάω,\r\nI snort through the nose, particularly in the act of coition, and\r\nconsequently read μυσιοχάνη, i. e. a woman who with mouth open snorts\r\nthrough the nose, precisely what the fellatrix undoubtedly does when at\r\nher work. This emendation certainly makes better sense, and is all the\r\nmore likely from the fact that μυιοχάνη and μυριοχάνη are also found\r\nas _variae lectiones_. Naumann would seem desirous of reading μυσάχνη\r\n(μυζάχνη), in which case it must be formed from μύζω, I suck, and ἄχνη\r\n(froth), in fact the secretion that adheres to the surface (of the\r\n_glans penis_)[21]. This last reading is all the more admissible, as\r\naccording to Suidas[22] the word also occurs in Archilochus. Possibly\r\nhowever we must regard as equally correct the form μυριοχαύνη, and\r\ntake it in the meaning given by the Gloss, viz. _in millibus hians_!\r\n(gaping in a thousand openings!), bearing in mind _Lampridius’_[23]\r\nexpression about Heliogabalus: _Quis enim ferre posset principem per\r\ncuncta cava corporis libidinem recipientem!_ (For who could endure a\r\nPrince _that welcomed lustful pleasure by every opening of the body_!)\r\n\r\nThe readings also vary as to σαράπους (turning out the feet); _Franz_\r\ngives ἀγράπους and ἀράπους; in the text of Hippocrates[24] on the other\r\nhand, as well in the Commentary of Galen it appears as ἡ Σεραπὶς, the\r\nlatter also giving it in the genitive—τῆς Σεράπιδος. But inasmuch as\r\nthe name of the goddess occurs sometimes as Σέραπις, sometimes as\r\nΣάραπις;, and as the genitive ending—πιδος easily admits of change\r\ninto—πόδος, it may very likely be that after all Σαράπους stood\r\noriginally in Hippocrates’ text. The author of the Gloss (loco citato\r\np. 136.) explains the word by ἡ διασεσηρότας καὶ διεστῶτας ἔχουσα τοὺς\r\nδακτύλους τῶν ποδῶν that is, a woman who has the toes drawn apart and\r\nseparated. But how are we to bring this explanation into agreement with\r\nthe κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον, (after the same fashion), that is to say,\r\nwith one of the modes of Love that are under discussion? Think of the\r\n_fellator_ or _fellatrix_, we are told, cowering down (ἐν γόνασι,—on\r\nthe knees) according to _Lucian’s_ picture (p. 229 above), and you will\r\nsee the stress of the body’s weight must always fall on the front part\r\nof the foot, and to widen the point of support he is instinctively\r\ncompelled to spread the toes. Well! but who can fail to see how very\r\nforced such an explanation is? still we do not in the least know how\r\nwe are to deal with it further. Of course we might leave the author\r\nof the Gloss his interpretation and proceed to look about for another\r\nof our own, though we have in many cases to confess the fact that our\r\ninvestigations undertaken with this end in view have not exactly led to\r\nany definite results. With the reading Σεραπίς we really do not know\r\nhow to deal. Perhaps the common representation, or else some particular\r\nquality, of the goddess so named gave occasion for a comparison\r\nwhich we now fail to understand, one that might possibly suggest an\r\nexplanation of the _Harpocratem reddere_ (to recall Harpocrates)\r\nof Catullus (69.) implying _irrumare_[25]. Whether the reader will\r\ntake within his purview the Σεραφίμ, ἐμπρηστάς· ἔμπυρα στόματα· ἢ\r\nθερμαίνοντας (Seraphim: kindlers; fiery mouths: or, making hot) of\r\n_Suidas’_ Lexicon, we must leave to him; in that case _Martial’s_ (II.\r\n28.) _calda Vetustinae nec tibi bucca placet_ (nor does Vetustina’s\r\nhot mouth please you) might afford an analogy. Proceeding to consider\r\nσαράπους, we find _Hesychius_ has σαραπίους, which he explains by\r\nμαινίδας (mad-women), and _Dioscorides_ is at one with him in regarding\r\nthe vice as something done μανικῶς (madly). In _Diogenes Laertius_\r\n(I. 4.) we read Pittacus was called: σαράποδα καὶ σάραπον διὰ τὸ\r\nπλατύπουν εἶναι καὶ ἐπισύρειν τὼ πόδε. (_turning out the feet_, because\r\nof his being flat-footed and trailing his two feet). It would be\r\nhardly credible to suppose that the author of the Gloss borrowed his\r\nexplanation cited just above from Diogenes Laertius or Suidas, in whom\r\nthe passage occurs as well. Further, the MSS. of Diogenes give also\r\nσυράπους, a word found several times in the sense of “to stand with\r\nlegs apart,” and Naumann too must have understood this in our passage,\r\nfor he gives as his rendering _crura ambulando divaricans_ (straddling\r\nthe legs in walking). Now leaving altogether out of the question the\r\nfact that the feminine form is found in Hippocrates, and assuming\r\nthe word to be used of men, it might perfectly well signify the\r\n_irrumator_, who takes the _fellator_ between his opened thighs[26], a\r\nposture that was generally regarded as obscene[27]. Indeed if we think\r\nof the _fellator_ as sitting on the ground at his work, the word of\r\ncourse can be equally well used of a woman, or _fellatrix_.\r\n\r\nAs to γρυπαλώπηξ we read in _Hippocrates_ (loco citato p. 629.) as\r\nfollows: “Satyrus in Thasos bore the nick-name of γρυπαλώπηξ; when\r\nabout twenty five he suffered from frequent nightly pollutions, and\r\nyet by day the same happened him even more constantly. When he was\r\nthirty years of age, he got consumption and died.” From this we see\r\nat once the question is of a dissolute man, who in consequence of his\r\nvicious practises had brought on such a weakness of the genitals, that\r\nhe suffered from continual evacuation of seed, the result being that\r\neventually Phthisis was set up, to which he succumbed. As variations\r\nof reading we find noted in _Franz’s_ Gloss ῥυπαλώπηξ and τρυπαλάπηξ;\r\nSchneider in his Lexicon renders γρυπαλώπηξ by “griffin-fox”, so he\r\nmust evidently have derived it from γρύψ (a griffin) and ἀλώπηξ (a\r\nfox). The Ancients depict the fox as a cunning, crafty animal and\r\nassign several characteristics as marking his behaviour that must\r\nprobably be taken into consideration in the present connection,—and\r\nparticularly the way he seizes and kills the hedge-hog. According to\r\n_Aelian_[28] he endeavours to throw the creature on its back, so that\r\nits mouth comes uppermost, and then discharges its urine into it.\r\nNow in order to signify the _irrumator_, the Ancients really could\r\nhardly have invented a better expression, when they, firmly convinced\r\nof course of the fact as stated, compared him to a fox. But what is\r\na γρυπαλώπηξ? _Hesychius_ under the word γρυπός (hooked, curved)\r\nexplains it as τὰ ἔξω τοῦ στόματος καμπυλόῤῥις· ὁ ἐπικαμπῆ τὴν ῥῖνα\r\nἔχων. (hook-nosed outside the mouth; a man having his nose bent down).\r\n_Suidas_ again says γρυπός, ὁ καμπυλόῤῥιν (γρυπός,—a hook-nosed man);\r\nso a man with a nose bent down crooked over the mouth. Now this we\r\nmight very well understand as applying to the _fellator_, inasmuch as\r\nhis nose, when the _irrumator_ presses down hard on him, as the sailor\r\ndoes to _Timarchus_ (p. 230 above), is of necessity compressed and\r\nbent down towards the mouth; γρυπαλώπηξ would according to this be a\r\nman who, like Timarchus in _Lucian_, is at once an _irrumator_ and a\r\n_fellator_. Of yet another word, κυναλώπηξ (fox-dog) cited by Naumann,\r\nwe propose to speak under the head of the _Cunnilingue_, who as we\r\nshall see might likewise be signified by the expression.\r\n\r\nFinally, as to ῥινοκολοῦρος (nose-docked), for which the MSS. also have\r\nῥινοκλοῦρος, it is certainly the case that in Antiquity the man who\r\npractised vice with strange women (_Moechus_,—adulterer) had his nose\r\ncut off[29], and as _Moechus_ equally signifies the _fellator_[30],\r\nthe latter also may very well have been obliged to forfeit his nose.\r\nFollowing this hint, it would be quite legitimate to suppose the\r\npunishment to have been put for the vice, and a _fellator_ called\r\nῥινοκολοῦρος (nose-docked) on this ground; in the same way as the loss\r\nof the nose might be looked upon as a consequence of vice, and anyone\r\nseeing a man in this case would at once think of his dissolute past\r\nlife, as indeed frequently happens at the present day amongst ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe town of Rhinocolurus,—and its history is more than\r\nproblematical,—would seem to have nothing whatever to do with the\r\nquestion. The passages from _Pliny_ and _Livy_ which Naumann quotes\r\ngive absolutely nothing beyond the name; and the mere existence of\r\nthe name _Diodorus_[31] certifies, in his story of how Actisanes\r\nproceeded against the Robbers in a way of his own: “He did not wish\r\nto put the guilty to death, nor yet to leave them unpunished. So he\r\nhad the accused brought up out of the whole country and inquired into\r\neach case most scrupulously; such as were found to be guilty all had\r\ntheir noses cut off by his orders, and were banished to the most remote\r\nspot in the Desert. The town he founded for them there received in\r\nremembrance of the punishment inflicted on its inhabitants the name of\r\nRhinocolura. It lies on the borders of Egypt and Syria, not far from\r\nthe sea-shore that borders the desert in that region, and displays an\r\nalmost complete absence of all requisites for comfortable habitation.\r\nFor the surrounding district possesses a soil thoroughly saturated\r\nwith salt, while inside the town very little water is to be found and\r\nthat positively tainted and of quite a bitter taste.” Diodorus relates\r\nfurther that these Colonists lived by catching quails; but of _Leprosy_\r\nthere is no mention either here or in Strabo or Seneca, so that\r\nNaumann’s statement to the effect that it served as a dwelling-place\r\nfor Lepers lacks entirely, up to the present and at any rate so far as\r\nwe know, any historical foundation, though the character of the place\r\nis not against such a hypothesis. Nor is any question raised in any\r\nauthor as to the vicious life of the inhabitants of Rhinocolura,—in\r\nfact in later times it was actually famous for the number of its _men\r\nof piety_[32].\r\n\r\nThough the explanation of ῥινοκολοῦρος given just now might very well\r\nat a pinch be regarded as satisfactory, still we think it hardly\r\nanswers sufficiently well to the κατὰ τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον (after the same\r\nfashion), while the variant ῥινοκλοῦρος seems to point to ῥιναύλουρος\r\nor ῥιναύλουρις as the true reading. In _Tatian_ (Orat. ad Graecos p.\r\n83.) in fact we read: _ῥιναυλοῦσι_ τὰ αἰσχρά, κινοῦνται δὲ κινήσεις ἃς\r\nοὐκ ἐχρῆν, καὶ τοὺς ὄπως δεῖ μοιχεύειν ἐπὶ τῆς σκηνῆς σοφιστεύοντας αἱ\r\nθυγατέρες ὑμῶν καὶ οἱ παῖδες θεωροῦσι. (They flute their obscenities\r\nthrough the nose, and make movements that in decency they should not\r\nmake, while actors who teach on the stage the whole art of how to\r\ndebauch a woman are the spectacle your daughters and your boys gaze\r\nat.) The Scholiast observes on this ῥινοκτυποῦσιν, οἱονεὶ τὸ πνεῦμα\r\nτοῖς ῥώδωσι, συνέλκοντες ποιὸν ἦχον ἐπὶ καταγέλωτι ἀποτελοῦσι, (they\r\nmake a noise with the nose, a sort of breathing with the nostrils; by\r\ndrawing in these they produce a certain sound by way of mockery), and\r\nin _Lucian_, Lexiphanes ch. 19., we find ἔοικα δὲ καὶ ῥιναυστῆσειν,\r\n(and I am like to go nose-playing), of which the Scholiast gives the\r\nfollowing explanation: ἀντὶ τοῦ ταῖς ῥισὶ καταυλῆσαι, ἐποίουν γὰρ τοῦτο\r\n_ῥιναυλοῦντες_, ἤτοι διὰ τῶν ῥινῶν ψοφοῦντες ἐπὶ διασυρμῷ τινῶν καὶ\r\nχλεύῃ. (put instead of _fluting with the nostrils_; for they used to do\r\nthis when they nose-fluted, or in other words, made a noise with the\r\nnostrils by way of mocking people and joking). Now if we take ῥιναυλεῖν\r\n(to nose-flute) in these passages,—and all this confirms what has been\r\npreviously said (above p. 144.) on the word ῥέγχειν (to snort) in the\r\nSpeech of Dio Chrysostom,—for _fistulam canere per nares_, _to play the\r\nflute with the nose_, and at the same time remember that _Eustathius_\r\n(as was noted above, p. 236. Note 2.) derived ἀπομύζουρις and μύζουρις\r\nfrom μυζᾶν-οὐράν (οὐρά,—the tail, the penis), the Greeks would seem\r\nto have said ῥιναυλεῖν-οὐράν, _penem pro fistula canere_, (to play on\r\nthe penis instead of a flute), and we should have the adjective or\r\nsubstantive ῥιναύλουρις, _qui penem pro fistula canit per nares_, (one\r\nwho plays on the penis instead of a flute with the nostrils), which\r\nadmirably expresses not only the action of the _fellator_, but also the\r\nmusic he makes to accompany it, as he is compelled to snort, drawing\r\nhis breath heavily through the nose.\r\n\r\nWhich explanation the reader will choose, we must really leave to him,\r\nfor interpretations of words of this sort can never be brought to the\r\nabsolute test of evidence, inasmuch as nick-names as a rule take their\r\norigin only too often in external circumstances. Still this much we\r\nthink we may pronounce with certainty, that the words of the Gloss\r\nhave to do simply _de rebus venereis_, with matters of love, and not\r\nwith Venereal complaints, and thus Naumann’s propositions[33] at least\r\nare devoid of foundation. Perhaps it may be possible by means of a\r\ncomparison of the licentious representations on old Vases, of which\r\nthe late _Hofrath_ Böttiger would seem to have possessed a choice\r\ncollection, and some examples of which are preserved also at Berlin,\r\nin connection with one or other of the words given in the Gloss, as\r\ngenerally with the embodiments in Art of the _Venus ebria_ (drunken\r\nVenus), to afford a better explanation, one that may indeed be of\r\nno particular value to the student of Antiquity pure and simple,\r\nbut nevertheless is indispensable to the Physician for the correct\r\nunderstanding of sundry diseases of the Ancients, or at any rate one\r\nsufficient to avoid incorrect assertions and false conclusions, and to\r\nrefute such.\r\n\r\nWe are not in a position to give a systematic history of the spread of\r\nthe vice of the _fellator_ and _irrumator_; but at any rate this much\r\nis certain that in Imperial times the Vice was most widely indulged in,\r\nas the Epigrams of _Martial_, and what _Suetonius_ relates in his Life\r\nof Tiberius (chs. 44, 45.) sufficiently bear witness.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases of the Fellator.\r\n\r\n§ 22.\r\n\r\nNow to pass on to the medical point of view, no one presumably will\r\ndeny that the mouth of the _fellator_ must necessarily be exposed\r\nto various complaints as a consequence of his Vice. Nevertheless\r\nthere prevails universally, so far as our studies up to the present\r\nhave enabled us to judge, complete silence among the Physicians of\r\nAntiquity as to the practice of λεσβιάζειν (to Lesbianize, to practise\r\n_fellation_) as a cause occasioning morbid affections of the mouth\r\nand the contiguous parts. This is the more surprising, as we find\r\nthat non-professional Writers are not entirely unacquainted with such\r\neffects, as we shall show directly. For our purpose this silence is\r\ndoubly unfortunate, depriving us as it does of all means of submitting\r\nsuch affections of the mouth as are described by Physicians to any\r\nproper appreciation in regard to their ætiological relationships,—an\r\nappreciation that in any case must naturally have been in view of our\r\nknowledge of the vice of the _fellator_ one of extreme difficulty.\r\nThe difficulty is this: _fellator_ and _fellatrix_, equally with the\r\n_Cunnilingue_, the fornicater and fornicatrix, were liable to suffer\r\nfrom ulcers of the throat, for example, as a result of their peculiar\r\nvice, but in the former case these ulcers were primary, in the latter\r\nsecondary,—now how is an inquirer to discover any diagnostic sign here,\r\nwhereby to distinguish the one class from the other? Yet all the while,\r\ncertainty on this point is of the very highest importance in view of\r\nthe question as to the existence of Venereal disease in Antiquity,\r\nthe chief argument always alleged against accepting the fact of such\r\nexistence being the absence of secondary symptoms such as are nowadays\r\ncommonly met with, especially about the throat[34].\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that not one, so far as we know, of the authors who\r\nhave studied the history of Venereal Disease makes any mention of\r\nthis circumstance; neither do the Pathologists ever bring forward the\r\nvice of the _fellator_ as an ætiological factor. _Clossius_[35] it is\r\ntrue speaks of _Irrumatio_, relying on _Perenotti di Cigliano_ and\r\n_Fabre_; but these last are really speaking of the _Cunnilingue_, not\r\nof the _fellator_. Probably they are of Erasmus’ opinion: λείχαζειν\r\n_ni fallor tale quiddam est Graecis, quale fellare Latinis. Nam vox\r\netiamnum manet, tametsi rem iam olim e medio sublatam arbritor._\r\n(λειχάζειν—to practise licking,—if I am not mistaken, is a similar\r\npractice with the Greeks to that of _fellation_ with the Romans. The\r\nword indeed still remains, but the thing I believe to have long since\r\nentirely disappeared). On this however _Forberg_ (loco citato p. 304.)\r\nvery justly adds: _Vereor ut vere: certe audio, ne ab nunc hominum\r\nquidem moribus plane abhorrere id schematis, quid viderint ii, quibus\r\nmagnas urbes adire licet._ (I fear this is not true: at any rate I am\r\ntold this sort of practice is not entirely repugnant to the habits\r\nof some men even of our own day, to judge by what those see who have\r\nthe opportunity of visiting large cities). How many primary ulcers of\r\nthe throat, especially in the case of common Prostitutes, may have\r\nbeen mistaken for secondary ones, and have been treated accordingly,\r\nin fact are treated so still, without the Physician having a suspicion\r\nof how they were actually incurred! But what the Physicians of our own\r\ntimes are ignorant of, though familiar enough to many of the Laity,\r\nthis knowledge we cannot reasonably demand from the Physicians of\r\nAntiquity. Yet supposing they did actually possess this knowledge, it\r\nwas very excusable if they looked at what lay nearest before their eyes\r\nand regarded all throat ulcers as being primary,—in just the same way\r\nas any Practitioner of to-day finds it excusable in a Colleague that\r\nhe thinks only of secondary ulcers, inasmuch as what in Ancient times\r\nhappened very commonly is practised at the present day at any rate much\r\nless frequently. Consequently the absence of mention on the part of the\r\nold Physicians of secondary ulcers of the throat in connection with\r\ncomplaints of the genital organs cannot be considered as any sort of\r\nproof of their non-existence.\r\n\r\nAmong the maladies to which the _fellator_ was exposed, we have in the\r\nfirst place to reckon the _foul smell from the mouth_[36], which is\r\nmentioned as especially prevalent among the Romans. The Physicians\r\nas a rule derived it, if no local symptoms, of ulcers, etc., were\r\napparent, from some fault of the stomach[37],—an instance surely where\r\nthe Laity were cleverer than the Profession! The sympathy between the\r\nmouth and the genitals and anus makes it evident why at the present day\r\nwe notice, particularly in immoral women, an evil smell from the mouth,\r\nwhich they endeavour to conceal by chewing burned coffee and the like.\r\nNo doubt this was the case in Antiquity[38] as well, so we are by no\r\nmeans justified in attributing every instance of foul breath in harlots\r\nand cinaedi to the practice of _fellation_.\r\n\r\nYet another consequence of _fellation_ was _pain in the mouth_\r\n(στομαλγία, mouth-ache; only we must remember as to this that _Pollux_,\r\nOnomast. III. 7. 69., cites ἀλγεῖν,—to suffer pain, as a synonym of\r\n_to love_), _tongue-ache_ (γλωσσαλγία[39]) and _toothache_[40], and\r\ngenerally pains of the palate and throat, rendering voice and speech\r\nindistinct. Hence _Martial_ says[41]:\r\n\r\n    Qui recitat lana fauces et colla revinctus,\r\n    Hic se posse loqui, posse _tacere_ negat.\r\n\r\n(The man who reads aloud his works, his throat and neck bound about\r\nwith wool, declares he cannot speak, yet cannot hold his tongue).\r\n\r\nBut the evil by no means stopped here; there more often occurred as\r\nthe result of the habit of _fellation_ acute no less than chronic\r\ninflammations of the palate (sore throats, quinseys). In the passage\r\nquoted a little above from _Lucian’s_ Pseudologistae, it is said of\r\nTimarchus: “In Egypt on the other hand they called you συνάγχη (sore\r\nthroat),—as everybody knows.” In explanation _Lucian_ adds: “It must\r\nhave been a close thing with you not to be choked, that time you came\r\nacross the sailor of a three-master, who fell upon you and stopped your\r\nmouth for you.” Without in any way detracting from the importance of\r\nwhat we are told here, it still appears to us, on full consideration,\r\nthat Timarchus was not merely a _fellator_, but an _irrumator_ as\r\nwell, and this is the more probable as he no doubt acquired this\r\nnickname, because he, _bene vasatus_ (well provided with a big\r\n_member_), frequently brought on sore throat, that is to say in those\r\nwho served him as _fellators_!\r\n\r\nMoreover this reveals to us the real meaning of a passage of\r\n_Aretaeus_, one that has often been quoted before as connected with\r\nVenereal disease. This occurs in the 9th Chapter of the Book[42],\r\nwhich would certainly seem to admit only of a direct application;\r\nstill we are convinced that much of the pathological description of\r\nsore throat (Ch. 7.) and many symptoms of the complaints of the uvula\r\n(Ch. 8.) owe their origin to _fellation_. Undoubtedly we have nowadays\r\nmuch fewer occasions to note affections of the uvula, which were of\r\nvery common occurrence among the Ancients[43], as is shown by their\r\nown accounts,—a circumstance hardly to be wondered at if we consider\r\nthe particulars told us about Timarchus. _Aretaeus_ in Ch. 9. makes a\r\ndistinction between κίων (pillar, uvula) or columella (little pillar,\r\nuvula), when the whole uvula is inflamed and swollen, σταφυλὴ or uva\r\n(bunch of grapes), when only the lower part is affected, and ἰμάντιον\r\n(little strap), when the palatal membrane is attacked. “Κίων”, he goes\r\non, “occurs most frequently with old men, σταφυλὴ with young men and\r\nsuch as are in the prime of life, affection of the palatal membranes\r\n(τὰ ὑμενώδεα) in those who are at the age of puberty and in boys.” The\r\nninth Chapter runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Ulcers of the Throat.\r\n\r\nUlcers arising in the throat of a benignant and harmless nature are\r\ncommon, the malignant and dangerous rare. Benignant ulcers of the sort\r\nare clean, of slight extent and superficial, neither inflamed nor\r\npainful. The malignant on the contrary are broad, hollow, lardaceous,\r\nwith a white, livid, or black covering. These ulcers are known as\r\n_aphthae_. But if the covering is very tough, then the malady is an\r\neschar, and is so called. At the edge of the eschar are set up an\r\nintense redness, inflammation and a congested state of the veins, as\r\nin _anthrax_ (carbuncle, malignant pustule), while small, distinct\r\nand unconnected, elevations of the mucous membrane appear, which\r\nare continually uniting with fresh ones that successively follow,\r\nand so an extensive ulcer is established. If this extends from the\r\nouter mouth too far inwards, in fact once it has attacked the uvula\r\nand relaxed it, the disease spreads over the tongue, gums and lips,\r\nwhile the teeth become loose and blackened. Further the inflammation\r\nattacks the throat. Patients so affected die in a few days after the\r\ninflammation and fever are set up, of the evil odour and of hunger;\r\nthe ulcer propagates itself by way of the wind-pipe to the chest, so\r\nthat very likely suffocation supervenes the same day. For lungs and\r\nheart can tolerate neither so foul an odour nor the ulcers themselves\r\nnor the ichor (puriform, septic matter) coming from them, but cough\r\nand difficulty of breathing supervene. Origin of this affection of\r\nthe throat is the swallowing of cold, pungent, hot, sour, or strongly\r\nastringent, substances. Now these parts serve the chest on behalf\r\nof the voice and the breathing, as also the abdomen for sifting the\r\nnutriment, and the stomach for swallowing food. But when these inward\r\nparts, viz. abdomen, stomach and chest, are attacked by a disease, the\r\ndisease is in turn conveyed and carried to the œsophagus, the tonsils\r\nand neighbouring regions.\r\n\r\nChildren up to the age of puberty suffer most in this way, for children\r\nhave the very greatest and most marked desire for coolness, because\r\nwith them the natural heat is at its greatest; the longing for foods of\r\nvarious sorts and cold beverages is boundless; while they shout loudly\r\nboth in quarrel and at play. This is equally true of girls up to the\r\ncommencement of menstruation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to locality, _Egypt_ gives most numerous examples of the\r\ndisease, for this country has at once a dry air to breathe, and many\r\nsorts of comestibles,—roots, herbs, garden vegetables, pungent seeds;\r\nwhile the drink is either thick, being Nile water, or artificially made\r\npungent with barley or with grape-skins. In _Syria_ the disease is also\r\nfound, especially in Coelesyria. For this reason the ulcers in question\r\nare known as _Egyptian_ or _Syrian_ ulcers.\r\n\r\nThe mode and fashion in which death occurs in these cases is\r\ndeplorable. The pain is a cutting and burning pain, as in anthrax\r\n(carbuncle, malignant pustule), the breath foul-smelling, the patient\r\nexhaling an intensely offensive breath, and re-inhaling into the chest\r\nanother no less so. Patients are so loathsome to themselves they cannot\r\ntolerate their own smell; the face is pale or livid, the temperature\r\nexcessively high, the thirst as distressing as in fever. Yet they\r\nreject drink when offered from dread of the pain of swallowing; for\r\nthey undergo great agony both by the compression of the palate and\r\nby the return of the liquid through the nose. No sooner have they\r\nlain down than they spring up again; then finding they cannot bear an\r\nupright posture, no sooner have they sat down than they are forced by\r\ntheir agony to lie back once more. Most commonly they move about in\r\nan upright attitude. For as they are unable to sleep, they avoid all\r\nrest, as though they were fain to drive away one torture with another.\r\nInhalation is deep, for they long for fresh air to cool themselves;\r\nexhalation on the contrary short and hurried, for the ulcers already\r\nburning like fire are heated yet further by contact of the feverish\r\nbreath as it streams out. Hoarseness comes on, and loss of voice, and\r\nthis goes on continuously increasing, until suddenly coming to the end\r\nof their resistance they give up the ghost.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the portion of the work devoted to Therapeutics (Bk. I. ch. 9.),\r\nwhich bears the title: Θεραπεία τῶν κατὰ τὴν φαρύγγα λοιμικῶν παθῶν,\r\n(Pestilential Affections of the Throat Regions, their Curative\r\nTreatment), caustics are especially recommended, as the actual cautery\r\ncannot be employed, and finally we read: “In some cases the uvula\r\nis destroyed right back to the bones of the palate, and the throat\r\nto the root of the tongue and the epiglottis, and in consequence of\r\nthis destruction they can get down neither solid food nor liquid, for\r\nliquids return through the nose, and so the patient dies of hunger.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow if we examine these statements more closely, we cannot first of\r\nall help wondering how the ætiological factors named by _Aretaeus_\r\ncould possibly be regarded by him as sufficient to account for such\r\ndangerous ulcerations,—ulcerations which he himself even calls λοιμώδεα\r\n(of pestilential character), though of course they are perfectly\r\nadequate to explain simple ulcers of the throat. Indulgence in pungent\r\ncomestibles and beverages is as little adequate to cause such symptoms\r\nas are the shouting and greediness of children, not to mention the fact\r\nthat these are in no way peculiar to Egypt or Syria. The whole account\r\nshows us clearly that while _Aretaeus_ was well acquainted with the\r\nforms the disease took, the ætiological factors were obscure to him and\r\nit was merely in a spirit of ill-timed speculation he subjoined them,\r\nproving once more how right _Appuleius_ was when he exclaims: _Dii\r\nboni! Quam facilis, _licet non artifici medico_, cuivis tamen docto\r\nVenereae cupidinis comprehensio._ (Great gods! how easy it is for any\r\neducated man, _always excepting a medical practitioner_, to understand\r\nthe passion of love).\r\n\r\nWe have already more than once in the course of these investigations\r\nproved how Egypt and Syria must be regarded as the nursery of\r\nlicentiousness in Antiquity, and the passage quoted from _Lucian_\r\n(above p. 229.) directly establishes the fact for us; again, a little\r\nfurther on (p. 240. Note I.) it was mentioned how boys particularly,\r\n(but also young girls), were used and specially trained as _fellators_.\r\nHence _Martial_[44] wishes he had a boy,\r\n\r\n    Niliacis primum puer is nascatur in oris:\r\n      Nequitias tellus scit dare nulla magis.\r\n\r\n(In the first place my boy must be born on the banks of Nile: no\r\nother land can produce more finished wickedness). From all this, as\r\nwell as from a comparison of the passage in Lucian, we believe we are\r\namply justified in concluding that Aretaeus’ ulcers of the throat,\r\nthese Αἰγύπτια καὶ Συριακὰ ἕλκεα (Egyptian and Syrian sores) were\r\nnot unfrequently a consequence of _fellation_[45]. That this should\r\nbe so is readily intelligible, when we consider the liability to\r\ncorruption and the acrid quality of secretions from the _glans penis_\r\nin hot countries. Again the βουβαστικὰ ἕλκεα (Bubastic sores), which\r\n_Salmasius_ cites from _Aëtius_[46] as being identical with the\r\nEgyptian and Syrian ulcers, find a satisfactory explanation on this\r\nhypothesis, for _Herodotus_[47] tells us in his time of the licentious\r\nworship of Bubastis, daughter of Isis, at Bubastos. In this expression\r\n(βουβαστικὰ ἕλκεα) the malady is named from one particular place, where\r\nit was probably specially prevalent, whereas in Aretaeus it is spoken\r\nof as general throughout the country.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we must not pass over the fact that Casaubon\r\ncommenting on the passage of Persius (V. 187.) to be quoted directly\r\nis inclined to regard the ἕλκεα Συριακὰ (Syrian sores) as a punishment\r\nof the Dea Syra (Syrian goddess). In this he relies on a passage of\r\n_Plutarch_[48] that runs to this effect: “But of the Syrian goddess\r\nthe superstitious believe that, if a man eat a sprat or anchovy, the\r\ngoddess consumes his shin-bones, fills his body full of sores, melts\r\ndown his liver.” The legend must at any rate be of great antiquity, for\r\nwe meet with it in _Menander_, in a fragment which _Porphyrius_[49]\r\nhas preserved,—in which however swelling of the belly and the feet\r\nis in question. To this also would seem to refer what _Persius_ (loco\r\ncitato) says:\r\n\r\n    Hinc grandes Galli et cum sistro lusca sacerdos,\r\n    Incussere _Deos inflantes corpora_, si non\r\n    Praedictum ter mane caput gustaveris alli.\r\n\r\n(Then the tall Galli, and the one-eyed priestess with her sacred\r\nrattle, instil terror of _the gods that make men’s bodies swell_,\r\nunless three times at dawn you have eaten the prescribed head of\r\ngarlic). True we cannot from the passage of Plutarch directly conclude\r\nthat ulcers of the throat also were ascribed to the anger of the Syrian\r\ngoddess in consequence of indulgence in a fish diet; rather should\r\nwe expect what is said to apply primarily to external skin-ulcers,\r\noccurring on other parts, as just on the shin-bone. Still we shall be\r\nquite justified in making the reference general, more particularly as\r\nliver-complaint is also ascribed to the goddess’s interference, and\r\nwe shall see that in Antiquity the cause of all ulcers was supposed\r\nto lie in some fault of the liver. Now as the fish had necessarily to\r\nbe put into the mouth to be swallowed, and as it was always supposed\r\nthe punishment of the goddess followed immediately on the offence,\r\nand affected the immediately active part, throat-ulcers might very\r\nnaturally be taken to be a result of such punishment. This again only\r\nfurther confirms our explanation just above to the effect that ulcers\r\nof the throat were a consequence resulting from vicious indulgence. For\r\nthe Temple-service of the Dea Syra was of course connected with every\r\nsort of licentious practice.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration this marked prevalence of _Corrosion of\r\nthe Shin-bones_, we might argue with considerable probability that\r\nit pointed to the existence of a disease of the bones following as a\r\nresult of vicious indulgence. On the other hand the observation that\r\nthe precise time the body became covered with ulceration was after\r\nindulgence in fish-eating cannot help being of weight in connection\r\nwith the doctrine of Leprosy; for to the present day we note as very\r\nfrequent among peoples whose chief nutriment is fish various forms\r\nof Leprosy. And again, we may very likely see in this prohibition of\r\na fish diet, which is also mentioned by _Athenaeus_[50], a sanitary\r\nregulation justified by experience as necessary in Syria, where\r\nskin-diseases and ulcerations were so common.\r\n\r\nBut not alone in Egypt and Syria did _fellation_ lead to suchlike\r\nunhappy results; we find the same to have been the case at Rome, as is\r\nproved by the following passage of _Martial_[51], a passage that has\r\nhitherto been completely overlooked in this connection, but which is\r\nnone the less of great importance:\r\n\r\n    _Indignas premeret pestis cum tabida fauces\r\n      Inque ipsos vultus serperet atra lues_:\r\n    Siccis ipse genis flentes hortatus amicos\r\n      Decrevit Stygios Festus adire lacus.\r\n    Nec tamen obscuro pia polluit ora veneno,\r\n      Aut torsit lenta tristia fata fame:\r\n    Sanctam Romana vitam sed morte peregit,\r\n      Dimisitque animam nobiliore via.\r\n    Hanc mortem fatis magni praeferre Catonis\r\n      Fama potest: huius Caesar amicus erat.\r\n\r\n(_When corrupting disease began to sorely afflict his unworthy throat\r\nand black contagion was creeping to his very face_, Festus, himself\r\nwith dry cheeks, comforted his weeping friends, and determined to\r\nseek the pools of Styx. But still he never disgraced his dutiful lips\r\nwith darkling poison, nor brought on a painful, miserable end by slow\r\nhunger; nay! rather by a Roman death he completed his holy life, and\r\ndismissed his soul the nobler way. Such a death fame may well exalt\r\nabove great Cato’s end; Caesar was his friend).\r\n\r\nThe words _indignae fauces_ (unworthy throat) obviously point to the\r\npractice of _fellation_, whereby he had brought on himself the _pestis\r\ntabida_ and _atra lues_, (corrupting disease, black contagion), and so\r\nwe have here a clear statement of the cause by one _doctus venereae\r\ncupidinis_ (learned in the passion of love), which cause was quite\r\nunknown to the _artifex medicus_ (medical practitioner). The _pia ora_\r\n(dutiful lips) are therefore to be taken merely ironically, as also the\r\n_sancta vita_ (holy life). Even the Cinaedus, as well as the maidens\r\nwho prostitute themselves in honour of Astarté, are invariably, as we\r\nhave seen, described in the Old Testament as _sanctus_ (holy), and we\r\nread e. g. in Job. Ch. XXXV. 14., of a good-for-nothing, how he will\r\ndie like such a _sanctus_. It was precisely this signification of\r\n_sanctus_ that led us to the idea of taking the throat affection for\r\na secondary consequence of paederastia, especially if we understand\r\na _double entendre_ to underlie the last words _huius Caesar amicus\r\nerat_ (Caesar was his friend). The Commentators it is true take them\r\nmerely as said by way of contrast with the death of Cato of Utica, who\r\nwas forced by Caesar’s enmity to take his own life, and as implying\r\nthis was not the case with Festus, consequently that his suicide is\r\nso much the more remarkable[52]. However it is doubtful which Caesar\r\nis meant, whether the word is merely a Title or a proper name. In\r\nthe second—and certainly this at first appeared to us to be the more\r\nlikely,—view we were of course bound then to turn our attention to\r\nhis character for dissoluteness. However as both _Catullus_[53] and\r\n_Suetonius_[54] represent him merely as a _Cinaedus_ in regard to the\r\nmale sex, if that is to say we subscribe to the accepted opinion, we\r\nafterwards came to the conclusion it was rather the _Emperor_ generally\r\nthat is spoken of here, and consequently that any other Emperor, e. g.\r\nTiberius, or Nero, or another, might be intended. It is true that if\r\n_pathicus_ (pathic) and _omnium virorum mulier_ (wife of all men) are\r\ntaken in a wider sense, there would be nothing to make the supposition\r\nimpossible that Julius Caesar is pointed at. Only that perhaps another\r\npassage of _Martial_ would seem to go against this, a passage where he\r\nseeks to excuse the several excesses and vices of a certain Gaurus by\r\ninstancing an exalted personage as patronizing each of them, and says\r\nfinally (Bk. II. 89.):\r\n\r\n    Quod fellas; vitium dic mihi cuius habes?\r\n\r\n(But for your _fellation_: tell me whose vice you follow in this?)\r\nStill against the _cinaedus_ view the words _indignae fauces_ (unworthy\r\nthroat) speak clearly. Probably in this connection the following\r\npassage of _Martial_ should also come in,—where the Poet says of his\r\nservant (Bk. I. Epigr. 102.):\r\n\r\n    Destituit primos virides Demetrius annos:\r\n      Quarta tribus lustris addita messis erat.\r\n    Ne tamen ad Stygias famulus descenderet umbras,\r\n      _Ureret implicitum cum scelerata lues_,\r\n    Cavimus et domini ius omne remisimus aegro:\r\n      Munere dignus erat convaluisse meo.\r\n    Sensit deficiens sua praemia, meque patronum\r\n      Dixit, ad infernas liber iturus aquas.\r\n\r\n(Demetrius left us in the first years of his bloom; the fourth summer\r\nwas but just added to his three lustres. We took all means to save our\r\nfaithful house-slave from descending to the shades of Styx, when he\r\nwas consuming under a malignant contagion that had fastened upon him,\r\nand remitted all my master’s rights for the sick lad,—who indeed well\r\ndeserved to win recovery at my hands. On his death-bed he recognized\r\nwhat I had done for him, and called me his _master_, though so soon to\r\ngo forth a free man to the streams of the nether world.)\r\n\r\nWas this _famulus_ (house-slave) the same person as the _puer_ (boy,\r\nslave), who is mentioned by _Martial_, bk. XI. 95.?\r\n\r\nThat not boys only, but girls too, had to suffer in this way among the\r\nRomans, and lost their lives from the complaint in question, is shown,\r\nwe think, by the following Epigram of _Martial_, Bk. XI. Epigr. 91.:\r\n\r\n    Aeolidon Canace iacet hoc tumulata sepulchro,\r\n      Ultima cui parvae septima venit hiems.\r\n    Ah scelus, ah facinus! properas quid flere viator?\r\n      Non licet hic vitae de brevitate queri.\r\n    _Tristius est leto leti genus: horrida vultus\r\n     Abstulit et tenero sedit in ore lues:\r\n    Ipsaque crudeles ederunt oscula morbi;\r\n      Nec data sunt nigris tota labella rogis._\r\n    Si tam praecipiti fuerant ventura volatu,\r\n      Debuerant alia fata venire via.\r\n\r\n(Canacé of the Aeolians lies buried in this tomb, who died a child,—her\r\nseventh winter was her last. Oh! the shame and horror of it! haste, a\r\ntear, thou that passest by. Here is no occasion to lament the short\r\nspan of human life. Sadder than death is the way of her death; a dread\r\ncontagion ate away her face, and settled in the tender little mouth.\r\nCruel disease infected her very kisses; and her lips were half gone\r\nwhen they were consigned to the grim pyre. If death must needs have\r\ncome to her with a flight so swift, at least he should have taken\r\nanother way. Death so hasted to close the issue of her persuasive\r\nvoice, that her tongue might not have time to bend the cruel goddesses\r\nto mercy).\r\n\r\nBesides the passages quoted, there are several others to be found in\r\n_Martial_, that must be taken as referring to the _fellator_; but\r\nsince the maladies that occur are equally prevalent in the case of the\r\n_Cunnilingue_, it will be more convenient to adduce them under that\r\nhead. Further, we only require to mention the fact that _pale lips_\r\nseem to have been regarded as a mark of the _fellator_[55].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cunnilingue.\r\n\r\n§ 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the vice of the _fellator_ is far surpassed in baseness by that\r\nof the _Cunnilingue_ (_qui opus peragit linguam arrigendo in cunnum,\r\neumque lambit_,—one who works by putting his tongue up into the female\r\norgan, and licking it). The Greeks called this practice σκύλαξ (a\r\npuppy), because it is a habit of dogs[56], and Hesychius explains it\r\nby σχῆμα ἀφροδισιακὸν, ὡς τὸ τῶν φοινικιζόντων (a method of love,\r\nresembling that of those who phoenicize). We have already, in the\r\npassage of _Lucian_ quoted a little above, found φοινικίζειν and\r\nλεσβιάζειν put side by side; _Galen_ moreover[57] does the same in\r\nthe following passage, a noteworthy one for our purpose on several\r\naccounts: “The drinking of sweat, urine and the menstrual blood of\r\nwomen is vicious and shameful, and not less so when a person, as\r\nXenocrates proposes to do, smears the regions of the mouth and throat\r\nwith excrement, and swallows it down. He speaks also of taking the\r\nwax of the ears. For my part I could never bring myself to take this,\r\neven though by that means I were never to be ill again. But excrement\r\nI consider yet more disgusting, and it is for a man of any decency far\r\nmore shameful to be called an Excrement-Eater[58] than an αἰσχρουργὸς\r\n(worker of obscenities) or a _cinaedus_. But of αἰσχρουργοὶ[59]\r\n(workers of obscenities), we abominate Phoenicians more than the\r\nLesbians, and it seems to me the man does something of the same sort\r\nas the former who drinks menstrual blood (μᾶλλον βδελλυττόμεθα τοὺς\r\n_φοινικίζοντας_ τῶν λεσβιαζόντων ᾧ[60] φαίνεταί μοι παραπλήσιόν τι\r\nπάσχειν ὁ καὶ καταμηνίου πίνων.) _A sensible man will neither seek\r\nto collect experiences on the point, nor yet on a practice, which it\r\nis true involves less_, but still is sufficiently shameful, that of\r\nsmearing a part of the body with excrement, because he has some hurt at\r\nthat spot,—or with human seed. Xenocrates calls this latter commonly\r\nγόνος (seed, semen), and distinguishes with minute care between cases\r\nwhere simple seed rubbed in by itself is of benefit, and cases where\r\nthe female has the same effect after combination with the male, as it\r\nis discharged from the woman’s womb.”\r\n\r\nThis explanation of Galen’s to the effect that the φοινικίζων (one\r\nwho phoenicizes) resembles the man who drinks menstrual blood, shows\r\nclearly that φοινικίζειν is _not_, as all the Lexicons give it, and\r\n_Forbiger_ (loco citato) also assumes, identical with λεσβιάζειν. It\r\nis true _Forbiger_ (p. 329. Note v.) gives the meaning _cunnilingere_\r\nas well, although the explanation is undoubtedly unsatisfactory which\r\nhe offers _à propos_ of an Epigram,[61]—one certainly apposite in this\r\nconnection, to the effect that the reason for this signification is,\r\n_quod cunnilingos a natando in mari quodam Phoenicei coloris (mari\r\nrubro) dixissent_, (that they had called them _cunnilingues_ from their\r\nswimming as it were in a sea of Phoenician purple colour—a red sea);\r\nfor the words in the Epigram, ἐν φοινίκῃ δὲ καθεύδεις (but you sleep\r\nin Phoenicia) cannot stand for anything else but simply φοινικίζειν, as\r\nindeed the passage from _Aloisia Sigaea_, which is quoted by Forbiger\r\nhimself, proves conclusively[62]: _Cum vellet mediam lambere, se velle\r\ndicebat in Liguriam_, (When he wanted to lick my middle, he used to say\r\nhe would fain _be into Liguria_—that is, would fain lick, _ligurire_).\r\nAccordingly just as λεσβιάζειν came into use as the distinctive\r\nname for the vice of the _fellator_, because it was practised\r\nto a distinctive degree in Lesbos, so too to be a _cunnilingue_\r\nwas called φοινικίζειν, because the habit was at home among the\r\nPhoenicians. Undoubtedly men’s shamelessness was carried so far that\r\nthey actually used women and girls at their period of menstruation\r\nfor this purpose,—a fact of the highest interest for us, as we shall\r\nshow directly. _Seneca_[63] expresses himself plainly enough on the\r\nsubject: “Quid tu, cum Mamercum Scaurum consulem faceres, ingnorabas,\r\n_ancillarum suarum menstruum ore illum hiante exceptare_? num quid enim\r\nipse dissimulabat? num quid purus videri volebat?” (How came it you\r\nwere ignorant, when making Mamercus Scaurus consul, _that he was in\r\nthe habit of catching in his open mouth the menstrual discharge of his\r\nmaidservants_? Did he make any concealment of it himself? did he pose\r\nas a pure-minded man? nay! not he). Again in another place[64]:\r\n\r\n“Nuper Natalis tam improbae linguae quam impurae, _in cuius ore feminae\r\npurgabantur_.” (Quite lately Natalis showed himself as malignant of\r\ntongue as he is unchaste, _into whose mouth women were used to purge\r\nthemselves_).\r\n\r\nNow if first of all we bear steadfastly in mind that this φοινικίζειν\r\nwas a vice, which prevailed primarily and especially among the\r\nPhoenicians and was later on disseminated abroad by them, and then\r\nconsider how the Greeks designated every vice, and particularly\r\nexcesses in love, as νόσος (disease), in the same way precisely as\r\nthe Romans used _morbus_ (disease),—comp. § 17—we _must_ see that\r\nφοινικίζειν is the same thing as νόσος φοινικίη (Phoenician disease),\r\nand shall be in a position to form an opinion on the Gloss[65] falsely\r\nascribed to _Galen_, which reads: _φοινικίη νόσος_· ἡ κατὰ Φοινίκην\r\nκαὶ κατὰ τὰ ἄλλα ἀνατολικὰ μέρη πλεονάζουσα. δηλοῦσθαι δὲ κἀνταῦθα\r\n_δοκεῖ_ ἡ ἐλεφαντιάσις. (_Phoenician disease_: a disease prevalent in\r\nPhoenicia and about the Eastern parts. Elephantiasis _appears_ to be\r\nsignified by this).\r\n\r\nEven granting the first part of this Gloss to have been really written\r\nby _Galen_, the last sentence at any rate is obviously an extraneous\r\nand later addition. This is at once indicated by the use of the word\r\nδοκεῖ (it appears), which comes in curiously, standing as it does\r\nnext-door to the _definite_ statement that this νόσος (disease) was\r\ncommon in Phoenicia; for surely anyone who knew this, must also have\r\nknown what the disease was. Again if he had wished to describe it by\r\nsome such phrase as the English “a sort of Elephantiasis”, he could\r\nhardly have failed to express himself in a different way to what he\r\nhas. But as a matter of fact, _Galen_ knew perfectly well, as we have\r\nalready seen, what φοινικίζειν was, and consequently what the φοινικίη\r\nνόσος (Phoenician disease) was, and it could not by any possibility\r\nhave occurred to him to suppose it any form of Elephantiasis.\r\nUnfortunately _Prof. Naumann_[66] has allowed himself to be misled by\r\nthis extraneous addition; he writes: “In the Work of a Pseudo-Galen is\r\ngiven a short explanation of the φοινικίη νόσος (Phoenician disease),\r\nor rather to speak strictly, the _conjecture_ is made,[67] that\r\nthis malady, a common one in Phoenicia and the East, may have been\r\nElephantiasis.” True indeed the word might _with equal likelihood_\r\nexpress a disease characterized by redness of the skin φοινίκιος s.\r\nφοινίκεος i. q. puniceus, purpureus, cruentus; φοινιγμὸς irritatio\r\ncutis per vesicantia—φοινίκιος or φοινίκεος = Phoenician purple,\r\npurple, blood-red; φοινιγμὸς = irritation of the skin by rubefacients).\r\nOr should we suppose _some leprous-venereal malady_ endemic and\r\naboriginal among the trading Phoenicians to be signified, which was\r\ncalled the _Morbus Phoeniceus_ (Phoenician disease) in the same way\r\nas in more modern times people spoke of the _Morbus Gallicus_ (French\r\ndisease,—Syphilis)? In any case it is remarkable that _Themison_ (who\r\nalso noted incidentally that Satyriasis at times attacks a population\r\nepidemically,—speaks of the special frequency of Satyriasis in Crete\r\n(_Caelius Aurelianus_, Acut. Morb. bk. III. ch. 18). As is well known,\r\nPhoenician and Hellenic Colonies had converged here; and the island\r\nremained in uninterrupted and active commercial intercourse with the\r\nmaritime cities of Phoenicia.\r\n\r\nAccording to the general supposition the Gloss of the Pseudo-Galen has\r\nreference to a passage of _Hippocrates_ occurring in the Second book of\r\nthe Prorrhetica,[68] where we read as follows: “But λειχῆνες—tetters,\r\nas also λέπραι and λεῦκαι,—scaly leprosies and white leprosies, where\r\nany of these occur in the young or mere children, or after appearing\r\non a small scale shall then increase but slowly, in these cases it\r\nis not right to call the exanthema or eruption an apostasis,\r\n(transitional state), but a νόσημα,—condition of disease. On the\r\nother hand where any of these affections occurs on a large scale and\r\nsuddenly, it would then be an apostasis. But whereas λεῦκαι arise out\r\nof _the most deadly diseases_, as e. g. the νοῦσος ἡ φθινικὴ,—wasting\r\ndisease, as it is called, λέπραι and λειχῆνες do so from the\r\nmelancholic, or diseases proceeding from black bile. And of such the\r\neasier to cure are those that occur in the youngest patients and are of\r\nthe latest origin, and arise in the softest and most fleshy parts of\r\nthe body.” _Foesius_ observes on the passage: “Nemini autem dubium est,\r\nquin hac parte _mendosi sint codices omnes_, cum ἡ νοῦσος ἡ φθινικὴ\r\nκαλουμένη scribitur. Nam φοινικίη νόσος ex Galeni exegesi procul\r\nomni dubio reponendum.” (Now no one can doubt that _all the MSS. are\r\ndeceptive_ here, reading as they do ἡ νοῦσος ἡ φθινική. For φοινικίη\r\nvόσος must undoubtedly be restored from the Exegesis of Galen). _J. W.\r\nWedel_[69] on the contrary writes: “Legunt quidam pro φοινικίη—φθινικὴ,\r\net vertunt tabem seu morbum tabidum, _sed contra fidem codicum\r\ncorrectiorum_, quibus Galenus ipse assentitur, et rei ipsius, de qua\r\ntextus agit, evidentiam.” (Some read φθινικὴ for φοινικίη, and render\r\nit _wasting_ or _wasting disease_,—_but against the authority of the\r\nbetter class of MSS._, with which Galen himself agrees, and against\r\nthe evidence of the context of the matter treated of). In the latter\r\nof these two statements Wedel, in spite of his mistaken view of the\r\nmatter generally, is perfectly right; whether he is so in the former as\r\nwell, we are not in a position to say, for alas! we lack the critical\r\napparatus absolutely indispensable for such a decision, not so much as\r\nthe Edition of _Mackius_ being on the shelves of our University Library.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we ought to make quite sure what Hippocrates\r\nunderstood under the name λεῦκαι. A disease of the Skin no doubt;\r\nbut of what particular nature it was, would seem not to be so easy\r\nto determine. According to _Coac. praenotion._ (Vol. I. p. 321.)\r\nHippocrates distinguished a λεύκη συγγενής and a λεύκη μὴ συγγενής\r\n(λεύκη inborn, and not inborn), the latter attacking individuals\r\nonly after puberty. _Hesychius_ says λεύκη, ἄνθος τι τῶν περὶ τὸ\r\nσῶμα γινόμενον, ἄλφος δὲ λευκή τις ἐν τῷ σώματι. (λεύκη—white\r\nleprosy, an eruption coming out on the exterior parts of the body,\r\nbut ἄλφος—dull-white leprosy, a form of λεύκη in the body). _Galen_,\r\n_Definit. med._ (Vol. XIX. p. 140) λευκή ἐστιν ἡ ἐπὶ λευκὸν χρῶμα τοῦ\r\nσώματος παρὰ φύσιν μεταβολή. (λεύκη is the change to an unnatural\r\nwhite colour of the body). According to this it would appear to be\r\nmerely superficial discolorations of the skin that writers understood\r\nby λεῦκαι,—a view that _Rayer_[70] seems to coincide with. _Pollux_ on\r\nthe other hand offers an explanation as follows: ἀλφὸς μέλας, ἐπιδρομὴ\r\nσκιώδης, ἐπιπόλαιος, εὐίατος, ἀλφὸς λευκὸς, λευκότης ἐπιτρέχουσα τῇ\r\nἐπιδερματίδι, αὐχμηρὰ, δυσίατος· _λεύκη_, ὅταν ἐπιτείνῃ ἡ λευκότης,\r\nκαὶ φύσῃ τρίχωσιν λευκήν, εἰ δὲ κεντήσειας, ὕφαιμος, δυσίατος, ἐστιν\r\nὅτε ὑπέρυθρος· _ἐπανθεῖ δὲ_ αὐτὸ (?) τοῖς _χείλεσιν, οἷον ἁλὸς ἄχνη_.\r\n(Black ἀλφός, a dark-coloured spreading eruption, superficial and\r\neasily curable; white alphos, a whiteness running over the epidermis\r\n(of the prepuce), dry harsh and difficult to cure; λεύκη, when the\r\nwhiteness extends, and produces a growth of white hairs, and if\r\nyou prick it, it is suffused with blood, difficult to cure, also\r\nsometimes reddish in hue. And the eruption comes out on the lips _like\r\nsea-foam_). Here λεύκη is evidently a much more deeply penetrating\r\nmalady, as indeed it is described by _Celsus_[71] and _Galen_.[72] It\r\ncorresponds with the white Leprosy of Moses. But the most curious thing\r\nis the statement appended to the effect that the affection broke out\r\non the lips like sea-foam. This is certainly to be referred to some\r\nother form of λεύκη, unless indeed we are to take it in connection\r\nwith the succeeding words in the text, λειχὴν ἄγριος (malignant\r\ntetter), in which case, as we have seen with regard to Mentagra (Tetter\r\nof the chin), the remark is based on a perfectly sound observation;\r\nand besides, the αὐτὸ gives absolutely no sense. On the other hand\r\nif Pollux’ datum in reference to the seat of λεύκη is correct, it\r\nmust obviously afford much light for clearing up the meaning of the\r\npassage in Hippocrates, and in deference to it we shall be bound to\r\nread φοινικίη instead of φθινικὴ,[73]—an emendation that presents no\r\ndifficulty, since φθινικὴ might very easily be read for φοινικίη, and\r\nindeed (as pointed out in the Note) was actually so read.\r\n\r\nBut one emendation leads on to another, and we shall find ourselves\r\nbound, on the analogy of the θαυμαστὸν πάθος (wonderful complaint) in\r\nDio Chrysostom, to read here also θαυμαστωτάτων νοσημάτων (of the most\r\nwonderful diseases) for θανατωδεστάτων ν., and translate accordingly:\r\n“but λεῦκαι arise out of the most terrible aberrations of the mind,”\r\nsuch for instance as the vice of the _cunnilingue_ is. If we examine\r\nfurther, we shall see it is not λευκαὶ but λεῦκαι that stands in the\r\ntext, so it cannot be a question of a skin-affection of the leprosy\r\ntype at all, for λευκὸς (white) rather implies transparent and shiny,\r\nand _Martial_ (XI. 99.) in a passage to be discussed more fully later\r\non, says:\r\n\r\n    Non ulcus acre, _pustulaeve lucentes_,\r\n    Nec triste mentum, sordidique lichenes,\r\n\r\n(No biting ulcer, or _shiny pustules_, nor yet disfigured chin, and\r\nfoul scabs). Accordingly we have here nothing whatever to do with the\r\nleprous-like λευκὴ, but only with _pustulae lucentes_ (shiny pustules),\r\nwhich as we shall show presently were a consequence of the practices\r\nof the _cunnilinigue_. We have the more right to assume this, as the\r\nold Physicians ascribe λευκὴ to the φλέγμα (phlegmatic humour),—an\r\nexplanation all the more likely to have been given, as directly\r\nafterwards follow the words, αἱ δὲ λέπραι καὶ οἱ λειχῆνες ἐκ τῶν\r\nμελαγχολικῶν (but leprosies and tetters arise out of the melancholic\r\ndiseases). True this is in contradiction with another passage of\r\nHippocrates,[74] for in this we read: _λέπρη_ καὶ κνησμὸς καὶ ψώρη καὶ\r\n_λειχῆνες_ καὶ ἀλφὸς καὶ ἀλώπεκες ὑπὸ _φλέγματος_ γίνονται. (_leprosy_,\r\nand itch, and scab, and _tetters_, and dull-white leprosy, and manges,\r\narise from _phlegm_). This much at any rate appears to us to result,\r\nviz. that the whole passage under discussion cannot possibly be by\r\nHippocrates, but much more probably is due to some author of the\r\nAlexandrine age, who enjoyed ample opportunities for studying the\r\nconsequences of the unnatural excesses as so often observed since\r\nPompey the Great’s time.\r\n\r\nTo assume that Hippocrates was actually acquainted with these in any\r\ncompleteness would up to the present be premature; at any rate we are\r\nbound, so far as our study of his writings enables us to judge, to deny\r\nhim any knowledge of the fact that sexual excesses were the cause of\r\nthe different affections of the genital organs chronicled by him. Of\r\ncourse he may have supposed all this to be notorious and the knowledge\r\nof it common property, but a host of statements would be found to tell\r\nagainst any such supposition. Opportunities of making acquaintance with\r\nthe vice of the _cunnilingue_ could certainly not have been lacking,\r\nit being so familiar a thing in his time that _Aristophanes_[75] again\r\nand again derided it in his Comedies. Whatever conclusion we come to on\r\nthis head, at least the passage of Hippocrates cannot justify anyone\r\nin maintaining that the φοινικίη νοῦσος,—(Phœnician disease) was true\r\nElephantiasis, even if, as may be, the preliminary proposition that\r\nelephantiasis was a _consequence_ of debauchery be made good,—a point\r\nto which we propose later on to return. On the subject of Satyriasis in\r\nCrete, we have already expressed our views.\r\n\r\nJust as the Phoenicians carried the seed of the vice to Greece and\r\nother lands, so at a later period was it disseminated from Syria to\r\nItaly; and so _Ausonius_ says (Epigr. 128.):\r\n\r\n    Eunus Syriscus inguinum liguritor,\r\n    Opicus[76] magister (sic eum ducet Phyllis)\r\n    Muliebre membrum quadriangulum cernit:\r\n    Triquetro coactu Δ literam ducit.\r\n    De valle femorum altrinsecus pares rugas,\r\n    Mediumque, fissi rima qua patet, callem\r\n    Ψ dicit esse: nam trifissilis forma est.\r\n    Cui ipse linguam quum dedit suam, Λ est:\r\n    Veramque in illis esse Φ notam sentit.\r\n    Quid imperite, Ρ putas ibi scriptum\r\n    Ubi locari Ι convenit longum?\r\n    Miselle doctor, Ȣ tibi sit obscoeno,\r\n    Tuumque nomen Θ sectilis signet.\r\n\r\n(Eunus from Syria, glutton of the privy parts, Opican (clownish) master\r\n(Phyllis teaches him his letters) sees the woman’s organ four-cornered:\r\nwhen compressed to a triangle he makes it out the letter Δ. From the\r\nvalley between the thighs start two furrows, a pair one on either side,\r\nwhile between them is a line, where lies the opening, the crack of the\r\nfissure; this he declares is Ψ; for ’tis three-pronged in outline.\r\nThen when he puts in his own tongue to it, lo! it is Λ; and he can\r\nfeel there is a true Φ marked therein. What, dunce, think you a Ρ is\r\ninscribed there, where a long Ι should by rights be placed? Miserable,\r\ncontemptible scholar, may the Ȣ (a noose) reward your foulness, and\r\nthe cleft Θ (letter of condemnation, being initial of θάνατος,—death)\r\nbe set against your name!) The more detailed interpretation of these\r\nobscene hieroglyphics the reader may find in the commentators on the\r\npassage, as well as in _Forberg_, loco citato p. 335.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases of the Cunnilingue.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 24.\r\n\r\nCan anyone believe such a vice as this was practised without incurring\r\npunishment? Yet there prevails amongst the Physicians of Antiquity,\r\neven including Galen, who knew the facts, an unbroken silence. It is\r\nimpossible to suppose that girls and women could have their genital\r\norgans purged in this mode altogether without evil results, more\r\nparticularly as actual experience in more modern times has proved that\r\nas a consequence of the habit of _cunnilingere_ inflammations of the\r\nexternal genitals have been set up in girls, as well as ulcerations in\r\nolder women through the licking of these parts by dogs. Among Ancient\r\nwriters we have found no vouchers for this; but on the other hand\r\nseveral such exist to show the mischief that results from the habit\r\nto the _cunnilingue_ himself. Excluding from consideration the _pale\r\ncomplexion_[77] and evil _smell from the mouth_, which were equally\r\nconsequences of the other forms of vice already mentioned, we have\r\n_paralysis of the tongue_ mentioned, at any rate in one passage[78]:\r\n\r\n    Sidere percussa est subito tibi, Zoile, lingua,\r\n        Dum lingis. Certe, Zoile, nunc futuis.\r\n\r\n(Your tongue, Zoilus, has been stricken with a sudden doom, while in\r\nthe act of licking. Why! surely, Zoilus, you copulate now). True this\r\nmalady must be counted as one of very rare occurrence; but this is by\r\nno means the case with the ulcerations, which would seem not always\r\nto have confined their attacks to the tongue, but to have extended\r\nalso, just as with the _fellator_, to the other parts of the mouth as\r\nwell. This cannot but have had the effect of making it very difficult\r\nin diagnosis to distinguish between an affection of the sort due to\r\n_fellation_ and one due to the vice of the _cunnilingue_.\r\n\r\nHere again it is _Martial_ to whom we are indebted for the proofs of\r\nour assertions. He leaves no room for doubt as to the way Manneius was\r\npunished for his debauchery in the following passage[79]:\r\n\r\n    _Lingua maritus, moechus ore Manneius,_\r\n    _Summoenianis inquinatior buccis:_\r\n    Quem cum fenestra vidit a Suburrana\r\n    Obscoena nudum lena, fornicem claudit,\r\n    Mediumque mavult basiare, quam summum:\r\n    Modo qui _per omnes viscerum tubos_ ibat,\r\n    Et voce certa consciaque dicebat:\r\n    Puer, an puella matris esset in ventre;\r\n    (Gaudete cunni, vestra namque res acta est!)\r\n    _Arrigere linguam non potest fututricem\r\n    Nam, dum tumenti mersus haeret in vulva_[80]\r\n    Et vagientes intus audit infantes,\r\n    _Partem gulosam solvit indecens morbus;\r\n    Nec purus esse nunc potest, nec impurus._\r\n\r\n(_Manneius was a husband with his tongue, a fornicator with his mouth,\r\na more polluted wretch than the big-cheeked wenches of the suburbs._\r\nWhen a vile bawd saw him naked from a window in the Suburra, she shuts\r\nher brothel up, and had rather kiss his middle than his head. The man\r\nwho but now could _penetrate every vessel of the inwards_, and say with\r\nassured voice and certain knowledge whether it were a boy or a girl\r\nin the mother’s belly,—rejoice, rejoice, organs of women, for your\r\nbusiness is done for you,—the same _cannot erect a fornicating tongue_.\r\nFor at the very moment _he is plunged tight in the swollen vulva_, and\r\nhears the babes whimpering within, lo! _a shocking disease paralyses\r\nhis greedy tongue. Now can he be neither clean, nor yet unclean_).\r\n\r\nThe Commentators, in particular _Farnabius_, refer the complaint spoken\r\nof in the passage just quoted to paralysis of the tongue. Farnabius\r\nsays in fact: “Paralysisne ἀπὸ τῆς ἀφέδρου καὶ τῶν ἐμμηνιῶν, quorum\r\nmalefico humore marcescunt segetes, apes moriuntur etc., Plin. c.\r\n15 Lib. V., an sideratio?” (Is paralysis intended, _resulting from\r\nthe menstruation and menstrual_ discharges, the poisonous humour of\r\nwhich will wither up crops, kill bees, etc.—Pliny ch. 15. Bk. V., or\r\na sudden stroke?) Even supposing us willing to admit the possibility\r\nof menstrual blood bringing on paralysis of the tongue, there can\r\nat any rate be no question of such a thing here, inasmuch as it was\r\nwith a pregnant woman Manneius carried out his vicious practises, and\r\nwomen in pregnancy do not _usually_ menstruate,—a fact about which the\r\nPhilologist naturally enough was only imperfectly posted. Of course\r\nthe possibility is always there, although the Poet says nothing about\r\nit; and the expression _vulva tumens_ (swollen organ) evidently stands\r\nhere, as is clearly shown by what follows, for _uterus gravidus_\r\n(pregnant womb)[81]. The _solvere_ (to loose, destroy) points in any\r\ncase to a destruction, a dwindling, of the part, brought about by the\r\n_indecens morbus_ (shocking disease),—which disease might very likely\r\nfind its explanation in the _scelerata lues_ (noxious contagion)\r\nmentioned on page 258 above. As a result of this, naturally enough\r\nnot only did _arrigere_ (to erect—the tongue) become impossible, but\r\nthe _impurus_ (_Cunnilingus_) (unclean cunnilingue) grew generally\r\nincapable of practising his vice. Nor yet was he _purus_ (clean)[82]\r\naltogether, for was he not a _cunnilingue_?—and now he was even less\r\n_purus_, because he suffered from the _indecens morbus_ (shocking\r\ndisease), which even Farnabius has so far rightly understood, that\r\nhe explains _nec purus_ (nor yet clean) by _morbo illo contaminatus_\r\n(because contaminated by the said disease).\r\n\r\nRather more doubtful and difficult is the interpretation of the\r\nfollowing passage of _Martial_[83], which would yet appear to be\r\npertinent here:\r\n\r\n    Non dixi, Coracine, te cinaedum;\r\n    Non sum tam temerarius, nec audax,\r\n    Nec mendacia qui loquar libenter.\r\n    Si dixi, Coracine, te cinaedum,\r\n    Iratam mihi Pontiae lagenam,\r\n    Iratum calicem mihi Metili.\r\n    _Iuro per Syrios tibi tumores,\r\n    Iuro per Berecynthios furores._\r\n    Quod dixi tamen, hoc leve et pusillum est.\r\n    Quod notum est, quod et ipse non negabis:\r\n    _Dixi te_, Coracine, _cunnilingum_.\r\n\r\n(I never called you a _cinaedus_, Coracinus; I am not so rash or\r\nso reckless, not being one to speak lies willingly. If I called\r\nyou a _cinaedus_, Coracinus, may Pontia’s jar be my enemy, and\r\nMetilius’ poisoned cup. _I take oath by your Syrian tumours, by your\r\nBerecynthian frenzies._ What I _did_ say is a trivial, an insignificant\r\nthing, a thing well known, that you will not yourself deny,—_I said_,\r\nCoracinus, _you were a cunnilingue_).\r\n\r\nWhat were these _Syrii tumores_ (Syrian tumours) that afflicted the\r\n_cunnilingue_ Coracinus? _Beroaldus_, Annotat. ch. 25., understands\r\nthem as “tumores et vibices a cultris et flagris quibus sacerdotes\r\nCybeles (quam deam Syriam esse volunt) se sauciabant.” (the swellings\r\nand weals from the knives and scourges with which the priests of\r\nCybelé,—whom they claim to be the Syrian goddess—used to wound\r\nthemselves). _Farnabius_ on the contrary thinks only _Berecynthios\r\nfurores_ (Berecynthian frenzies) to be intended in this explanation,\r\nand makes the _tumores Syrii_ mean “_ulcera et morbos quibus credebatur\r\nirata Isis inflare peierantes_,” (ulcers and maladies with which the\r\nangry Isis was supposed to afflict false swearers), appealing to the\r\npassage of Persius[84], already brought forward a few pages back (p.\r\n254.), which reads:\r\n\r\n    Hinc grandes Galli et cum sistro lusca sacerdos,\r\n    _Incussere Deos inflantes corpora_, si non\r\n    Praedictum ter mane caput gustaveris alli.\r\n\r\n(Then the tall Galli, and the one-eyed priestess with her sacred\r\nrattle, instil terror of _the gods that make men’s bodies swell_,\r\nunless three times at dawn you have eaten the prescribed head of\r\ngarlic).\r\n\r\nWhether this passage affords any direct proof would seem doubtful,\r\ninasmuch as the _inflare corpus_ (to make the body swell) properly\r\nspeaking only refers to the abdomen. To this also the eating of the\r\nallium (garlic), which no doubt first won its magic significance on\r\naccount of its carminative properties, appears to point.\r\n\r\nHowever another explanation is possible. Referring back to the passage\r\nof _Porphyrius_ quoted above on p. 254., the _tumores_ Coracinus had\r\ncontracted in consequence of his general incontinence with women,\r\nwhich incontinence had at last brought him as a _senex_? (old man) to\r\nsuch a condition of weakness that nothing was left him but the vice of\r\n_cunnilingere_ to satisfy his still unexhausted lubricity. A side light\r\nin this case may be thrown on the matter by Horace’s description of the\r\n_Anus libidinosa_ (The lecherous old woman) in Epodes VIII. 9. 19.:\r\n\r\n    Venter mollis et femur _tumentibus_\r\n      Exile _suris_ additum.—Fascinum\r\n    Quod ut superbo provoces ab inguine\r\n      Ore allaborandum est tibi.\r\n\r\n(Flabby belly and skinny thigh joined with swollen calves,—A tool, that\r\nrequires you, in order to call it up from the supercilious groin, to\r\nwork it with the mouth). _Casaubon_ in his commentary on the passage of\r\n_Persius_ is for connecting this, as well as the _Tumores Syrii_, with\r\nἕλκεα Συριακὰ (Syrian sores), and—as quoted on p. 253 above—to regard\r\nthem as a consequence of the wrath of the _Dea Syria_ (Syrian goddess).\r\nNo doubt as a matter of fact the _tumores_ were a result of debauchery,\r\none that was prevalent in Syria and was disseminated thence to Rome,\r\nfor they attacked a _cunnilingue_ no less than other debauchees; but\r\nthis brings us no nearer to a knowledge of their nature. We should\r\nperhaps be inclined to regard them as swellings of the tonsils or of\r\nthe lympathic glands of the throat, having the same significance as the\r\ninguinal buboes in affections of the genitals.\r\n\r\nBut what are the _Berecynthii furores_ (Berecynthian frenzies)?\r\nPossibly nocturnal pains in the bones, that torment a patient to the\r\npitch of frenzy? The metaphor, drawn from the nocturnal rites of\r\nCybelé, must be admitted to be a happy one. Still, however acceptable\r\nconjectures of the sort may be to many, we cannot take them seriously.\r\nIt appears to us most judicious to regard the _Syrii tumores_ as being\r\nulcerations that covered the body of Coracinus, and by their violent\r\nitching reduced him to a state of frenzy. Our view as stated is\r\nconfirmed by Epigram 108. of _Ausonius_:\r\n\r\n\r\nIN SCABIOSUM POLYGITONEM.\r\n\r\n    Thermarum in solio si quis Polygitona vidit\r\n    Ulcera membrorum scabie putrefacta foventem,\r\n    Praeposuit cunctis spectacula talia ludis.\r\n    Principio tremulis gannitibus aëra pulsat,\r\n    Verbaque lascivos meretricum imitantia coetus\r\n    Vibrat et obscoenae numeros pruriginis implet.\r\n    _Brachia deinde rotat velut enthea daemone Maenas,_\r\n    Pectus, crura, latus, ventrem, femora, _inguina_, _suras_,\r\n    Tergum, colla, humeros luteae Symplegadis antrum.\r\n    Tam diversa locis vaga carnificina pererrat,\r\n    Donec marcentem calidi fervore lavacri\r\n    Blandus letali solvat dulcedine morbus.\r\n    Desectos sic fama viros, ubi cassa libido\r\n    Femineos coetus et non sua bella lacessit,\r\n    Irrita vexato consumere gaudia lecto:\r\n    Titillata brevi quum iam sub fine voluptas\r\n    Fervet et ingesto peragit ludibria morsu.\r\n    Turpia non aliter Polygiton membra resolvit,\r\n    Et quia debentur suprema piacula vitae,\r\n    Ad Phlegethonteas sese iam praeparat undas.\r\n\r\n(_To the scabby Polygiton._—If any man caught sight of Polygiton on the\r\nseat of the Thermae bathing the sores on his limbs all rotten with\r\nscab, he preferred so entertaining a spectacle to all the games. First\r\nhe beats the air with twittering, whining noises, and utters broken\r\nsounds in imitation of the wanton embraces of harlots, and completes\r\nthe symphony of his foul-minded lechery. _Then he twirls his arms about\r\nlike a Maenad under the god’s afflatus_; breast, legs, flank, belly,\r\nthighs, _groin_, _calves_, back, neck, shoulders, cave of the bemired\r\nSymplegades,—i. e. hollow between buttocks,—in so many different places\r\ndoes the shooting torture fly, until he droops and faints in the warmth\r\nof the hot bath and the disease is soothed and gives a fatal respite.\r\nSo it is said castrated eunuchs, when barren desire tries hard for\r\nembraces with women and for contests they cannot properly engage in,\r\nare consumed with empty transports on the tossed and tumbled bed,—till\r\neventually their lust, tickled and tickled, flames high for a last\r\nmoment, and completes the wanton act by applying the mouth and biting.\r\nSo with Polygiton a final spasm relaxes his disfigured limbs, and the\r\nlast sin-offerings of his life being due, thus makes himself ready for\r\nthe waves of Phlegethon).\r\n\r\nTrue the connexion with the vice of _cunnilingere_ is apparently lost\r\nhere, but this also may be preserved without any great straining of\r\nthe words, as we shall see presently; and accordingly the _Tumores\r\nSyrii_ can be quite well regarded as a consequence of the vice of the\r\n_cunnilingus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMentagra (Tetter of the Chin).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 25.\r\n\r\nEver since the so-called first appearance of Venereal Disease, most of\r\nthe advocates of the antiquity of the complaint have made a point of\r\nbringing in _Mentagra_[85] within the purview of the quotations they\r\nadduce to prove their contention, although strictly speaking they were\r\nnever likely to succeed in a direct demonstration that the disease was\r\nreally and truly connected with sexual excesses. Accordingly, to the\r\npresent day the majority of them see in it nothing more than a form\r\nof Leprosy, particularly as _Hensler_[86] and _Sprengel_ were among\r\nthose who decided in favour of its leprous character. Instead of giving\r\na useless list of names of the different authors, who in former days\r\ndeclared for the one view or the other, we think it more expedient\r\nto quote first of all the capital authority, a passage in Pliny[87],\r\nsetting this down as it stands so as to be able afterwards to form a\r\ncorrect appreciation of its bearing:\r\n\r\nCap. I. “Sensit et _facies_ hominum novos omnique aevo priore\r\nincognitos, non Italiae modo, verum etiam universae prope Europae\r\nmorbos: tunc quoque non tota Italia, nec per Illyricum Galliasve aut\r\nHispanias magnopere vagatos, aut alibi, quam Romae circaque: sine\r\ndolore quidem illos ac sine pernicie vitae: sed tanta foeditate, ut\r\nquaecunque mors praeferenda esset.\r\n\r\nCap. II. “Gravissimum ex his _lichenas_ appellavere _Graeco nomine_:\r\n_Latine_, quoniam a mento fere oriebatur, _ioculari primum lascivia_\r\n(ut est procax natura multorum in alienis miseriis) mox et usurpato\r\nvocabulo, _mentagram_: occupantem in multis totos utique vultus, oculis\r\ntantum immunibus, descendentem[88] vero et in colla pectusque ac manus,\r\nfoedo cutis furfure[89].\r\n\r\nCap. III. “Non fuerat _haec lues_ apud maiores patresque nostros.\r\nEt primum _Tiberii Claudii Caesaris_ principatu medio irrepsit in\r\nItaliam, quodam Perusino equite Romano Quaestorio scriba, quum in\r\nAsia apparuisset inde contagionem eius importante.

Moreover the human _face_ experienced new diseases, and such\r\nas had been unknown in any former age not merely to Italy but to the\r\nwhole of Europe very nearly, and these not widely diffused over Italy\r\ngenerally, or through Illyricum or the provinces of Gaul or of Spain,\r\nor indeed anywhere else but just in Rome and its neighbourhood. They\r\nwere painless, it is true, and did not involve loss of life, but were\r\nof such a horrible nature that death in any form would have been\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\nCh. II. The most serious of these diseases they called\r\n_lichenes_,—scabs, a Greek name; in Latin, as the malady generally\r\nshowed itself first on the chin, it was known as _mentagra_,—chin-bane,\r\nscab or tetter of the chin, at the first by way of jest and\r\nmockery—for it is the nature of the multitude to make merry at\r\nothers’ misfortunes,—but soon this became the recognized word. In many\r\npersons it covered absolutely the whole countenance, the eyes alone\r\nbeing left unaffected, with a horrible scurf of the skin, going down\r\nsometimes to the neck as well, and breast, and hands.\r\n\r\nCh. III. _This plague_ had not existed among our ancestors or fathers.\r\nFor the first time it crept into Italy in the middle of the reign of\r\n_Tiberius Claudius Caesar_, a certain Perusinius, a Roman knight and\r\nQuaestorian secretary, after a period of service in Asia, importing\r\nthe contagion from there. But women did not suffer from the malady,\r\nor slaves, nor yet common folk of humble or middle-class station; but\r\nnobles, and this particularly by the rapid infection of an embrace. In\r\nmany cases the scar, where patients had submitted to medical treatment,\r\nwas more horrible than the disease itself. For indeed it was curable\r\nby caustics, except when the body had been consumed to the very bones,\r\nthe slowness of the treatment defeating its own end. Physicians\r\narrived from Egypt, _mother-land of such taints_, practising this cure\r\nexclusively, to their own great profit. If, that is, it is true that\r\nManilius Cornutus, of the Praetorians and governor of the Province of\r\nAquitania, offered 200,000 sesterces for his cure when attacked by this\r\ndisease).\r\n\r\nHere if ever, it particularly behoves us to begin with an elucidation\r\nof the meaning of the name given to the malady under discussion.\r\n_Gruner_[91] long ago called attention to the divergence of opinion\r\nas to the signification of λειχῆνες (scabs) among the writers of\r\nAntiquity, but without success in putting the actual facts in a clear\r\nlight. We must try if we can be more fortunate. An old etymologist\r\nsays: λειχὴν παρὰ τὸ λείχω, καὶ γὰρ φάσιν ἐκ τοῦ λείχειν τὸ πάθος\r\nἐπαίρεται[92], (λειχὴν comes from λείχω,—I lick, because they say\r\nthe complaint is set up by licking). On this we may say.—there is no\r\ndoubt λειχῆνες and λιχῆνες are derived from λείχειν or λίχειν, but\r\nthe explanation _Kraus_ gives of the reason in his Lexicon we cannot\r\nthink conceivable, viz. “because Lichen, the same as a parasitic plant\r\ndoes, or a skin-disease in animals, always creeps round further and\r\nfurther (see _Herpes_,—creeping eruption), or _as it were licks its\r\nway_,” for λείχειν is not so much _lambere_, λάπτειν,—to lick over,\r\nlick along, as _lingere_, _ligurire_[93],—to lick up, lick up greedily.\r\nAt the same time it is true the word (_lambere_) was used by the\r\nRomans in a somewhat similar sense, so perhaps we ought not to refer\r\nto _lambit flamma_ (a flame licks), but rather to Plautus’ expression\r\n(_Pers. prolog. 5._), “_quorum imagines lambunt hederae sequaces_”\r\n(whose images creeping ivy-tendrils lick, i. e. entwine). Most probably\r\nthere are two different stems underlying the word. Of these one is\r\nλέγειν,—to lay, etc., hence λέγνη, the edging, the border, λίγνυς, soot\r\n(depositing itself on the edge), together with the bye-forms λέχω, λίχω\r\nwith which in fact λιχὴν, _moss_[94], so far as it forms on the edge,\r\nthe surface, fringes it, would be connected. The other stem will be\r\nλίγω, or λείγω (comp. λίβω and λείβω), λείχω and λείχην, λίγγω, λίζω,\r\nto which would have to be referred also λίγυς and λιγυρὸς,—clear,\r\nshrill (ligurire, lingere,—to lick greedily, to lick), in all of which\r\nthe underlying sense is of licking, and the noise connected with it.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that later on the derivatives of these stems suffered\r\nmanifold variations and corruptions; but how much of all this is to\r\nbe attributed to speakers and writers among the Greeks themselves,\r\nand how much to subsequent transcribers and editors of their work, it\r\nmight be difficult to decide. But every day we have occasion to note a\r\nnumber of words, to which accident or other circumstances have given an\r\nambiguous character. These, used quite unsuspectingly by the ignorant,\r\nmake the better informed person blush, or else extort a smile from him\r\nthat often enough causes the speaker no little embarrassment to know\r\nthe reason. Undoubtedly it was the same with the Greeks and Romans,\r\nand so confusions between λίχω and λείχω, λιχὴν and λειχὴν, might have\r\neasily arisen, from which people were subsequently unable to extricate\r\nthemselves. Originally perhaps λείχω, equally with _lingo_ and\r\n_ligurio_ (to lick), may have had the simple sense of licking, and only\r\nthrough later accretions to the meaning, have acquired an ambiguous\r\ncharacter; soon however this got transferred to it to the exclusion of\r\nall others, and we find it used preferentially as the regular word for\r\n_cunnilingere_. The correctness of our conclusion would seem to follow\r\nabove all from the passage of _Aristophanes_[95] given below, where it\r\nis the additional words that narrow down the meaning of λείχω (I lick),\r\nand definitely bring out the special signification. The words are said\r\nof Ariphrades, who reminds us of the ἀποφρὰς (unmentionable), the name\r\nLucian appropriates to Timarchus:\r\n\r\n    Οὐδὲ παμπόνηρος, ἀλλὰ καὶ προσεξεύρηκέ τι·\r\n    τὴν γὰρ αὑτοῦ _γλῶτταν αἰσχραῖς ἡδοναῖς μαίνεται,\r\n    ἐν κασαυρίοισι λείχων τὴν ἀπόπτυστον δρόσον_,\r\n    καὶ μολύνων τὴν ὑπήνην, καὶ κυκῶν τὰς ἐσχάρας.\r\n\r\n(Nor yet utterly villainous is he, but he has discovered yet another\r\ndevice; for he polluted his own tongue with foul delights, _in the\r\nstews licking up the abominable dew_, defiling the hair on the upper\r\nlip, and tumbling the girls’ _nymphae_).\r\n\r\nIn the following Epigram[96] of an unknown author λείχω is found used\r\nabsolutely, without any supplementary words:\r\n\r\n    _Χείλων_ καὶ _λείχων_ ἴσα γράμματα· ἐς τί δὲ τοῦτο;\r\n    _Λείχει_ καὶ _Χείλων_, κἂν ἴσα, κἂν ἄνισα.\r\n\r\n(Χείλων,—a proper name, also means _of the lips_,—and\r\nλείχων,—licking,—have the like letters; now what does this point to?\r\nChilon licks lips, whether lips like his own, or whether unlike). In\r\nexplanation of this Epigram _Forbiger_ says (loco citato p. 326.):\r\n“Lusus in Chilonem cunnilingum. Hunc ait iure quodam suo lingere, qui\r\nvel nomine iisdem literis constante prae se fert lingentem et lingentem\r\nquidem tum labra oris, ut labris ligentis similia, tum cunni, ut\r\ndissimilia.” (Pun on the name of Chilon, a _cunnilingue_. The poet says\r\nhe (Chilon) licks by a sort of inherent right of his own, who even in\r\nhis name, made up of the same letters, proclaims himself as licking,\r\nand licking now the lips of the mouth, which are like the lips of\r\nthe licker, now those of the female organ, which are unlike). Χεῖλος\r\nwas in fact used also of the lips of a woman’s organ, the _nymphae_;\r\nthe Scholiast on τὰς ἐσχάρας (the _nymphae_) in the passage from\r\nAristophanes given a little above, interprets this word by τὰ χείλη\r\nτῶν γυναικείων αἰδοίων (the lips of the female privates). According\r\nto _Schneider_ in his Lexicon χείλων (adj.) signifies _thick-lipped_.\r\nPerhaps it was this very Epigram that led _Lambert Bosius_ to make the\r\nstatement that χείλων arose by a mere transposition of the letters from\r\nλείχον.\r\n\r\nNow if λείχην,—for we consider it should be thus accented,—is derived\r\nfrom λείχω (I lick), we cannot but regard it as meaning: something\r\n_produced by licking, a complaint brought on by licking_, and\r\nparticularly _by the licking of the cunnilingue_! Surely the Greeks\r\ncould hardly have expressed themselves more clearly. Then the fact that\r\nthe name came from the mouth of the common people is the very best\r\nreason for its not having been understood by the educated. Yet all\r\nthe while an entirely similar form of expression has grown up in the\r\nmouth of the German common people, the real meaning of which very few\r\nhave fathomed, but which most certainly arose in the same way as the\r\nGreek λείχην. No doubt many of my readers have again and again heard\r\nit said of some one with an eruption round the mouth, that is, someone\r\nsuffering from _Herpes labialis_ (Creeping eruption of the lips):\r\n“Well! you _have_ been licking!”—for which educated people substitute\r\nthe obviously insufficient, “You _have_ been picking!” Very commonly\r\nagain one may hear: “You _have_ been licking _greben_, or picking\r\n_greben_; and this word _greben_ is understood as being identical with\r\n_grieben_,—_greaves_ in English, i. e. the remnants of lard that has\r\nbeen cut up into pieces and fried, because the separate pustules of\r\nthe _herpes labialis_ resemble in appearance the _greaves_. So people\r\nsometimes also say still more explicitly, “You _have_ been licking,\r\nor picking, _greaves_; and one of them has been left sticking to your\r\nmouth, to prove your greediness!”\r\n\r\nThis explanation may seem a very likely one to many; nevertheless we\r\nincline to believe the word to be of later origin, and to have arisen\r\nfrom ignorance of the actual facts. We consider it more probable\r\nthat _greben_ owes its origin to some corruption of language growing\r\nout of _gremium_, the bosom. We have been led to this conjecture by\r\na statement of _Adelung’s_ in his Dictionary, Article “Grieben”,\r\nwhere he says: “In middle-Latin _grieben_, (greaves), were called,\r\nin accordance with a common interchange change of the letters b. and\r\nm. _gremium_”,—though indeed we cannot regard the word as solely and\r\nentirely mediæval Latin, for it is found occurring as early as _Pliny_\r\n(Hist. Nat. XII. 19.) and _Columella_ (Res Rust. XII. 19. 3.), and is\r\nevidently connected with _cremare_ (to burn). So just as in this case\r\n_cremium_ and _gremium_ may have been used interchangeably, has _grebe_\r\ngrown out of _greme_ in German, and the latter come to be used as a\r\nsynonym of _griebe_,—the latter words according to this having as\r\nlittle in common with one another as the former. However those better\r\npractised in the science of word formation must here decide!\r\n\r\nNow as to the word _Mentagra_ (Tetter, Scab). This was evidently a\r\nword first framed by the Romans, as is distinctly stated not alone by\r\n_Pliny_, but by _Galen_ as well (De compos. medic. secundum locos Bk.\r\nV., edit. Kühn Vol. XII. p. 839.). The latter says: Ἐκδόριον λειχήνων·\r\nταύτῃ Πάμφιλος χρησάμενος ἐπὶ Ῥώμης πλεῖστον ἐπορίσατο _ἐπικρατούσης ἐν\r\nτῇ πόλει τῆς μεντάγρας λεγομένης_. (Blister for Lichenes (Scabs); in\r\nthis way Pamphilus in his practise at Rome made most headway against\r\n_the Mentagra as it was called, then prevalent in the city_). It is\r\nusually considered to be formed on the analogy of _Podagra_, _Chiragra_\r\n(gout of the feet, gout of the hands) etc. from _mentum_, the chin,\r\nand ἄγρα, the act of catching, seizing hold of,—so a disease that\r\nattacks the chin. But more probably all these words are compounded not\r\nwith ἄγρα at all, but with ἄλγος (suffering). That is to say just as\r\nἀλγαλέος, by Attic interchange of letters, becomes ἀργαλέος (grievous),\r\nκεφαλαλγία becomes κεφαλαργία (head-ache), and ληθαλγία, ληθαργία\r\n(drowsiness, lethargy), so from ποδαλγία we get ποδαργία, and then by\r\nmetathesis ποδάγρα (gout). (Comp. _Doederlein_ “Lateinische Synonyme\r\nund Etymologien”,—Latin Synonyms and Etymologies Pt. 4. p. 424.). The\r\nremark _Pliny_ adds however “_ioculari primum lascivia_” (at first by\r\nway of jesting mockery) evidently points to some ambiguity underlying\r\nthe word. But whether this consists in the recognition of the likeness\r\nin sound between _mentum_, the chin, and _menta_, or _mentula_,\r\nthe virile member, or is to be looked for in the ἄγρα, it might be\r\ndifficult to determine. Still it seems probable, but without wishing to\r\nentirely exclude the former hypothesis, that the latter is the case, as\r\nwill appear directly.\r\n\r\n_Galen_[97] distinguishes between λειχὴν ἁπλοῦς and λειχὴν ἄγριος\r\n(simple _lichen_, and malignant _lichen_) in his enumeration of\r\nSkin-diseases, and still more plainly in another place[98] he says:\r\n“λειχὴν is likewise a Skin-disease; there are two forms of it, ὁ μὲν\r\nἥμερος καὶ πρᾳότερος, ὁ δὲ ἄγριος καὶ χαλεπώτερος (the one benignant\r\nand milder, the other malignant and more serious). But in both of them\r\nminute scales are detached from the skin, and the part of the skin\r\nunderneath the scales is reddened and almost ulcerated. The affection\r\narises from a salt phlegmatic humour (φλέγματος ἁλμυροῦ) and yellow\r\ngall, hence the scales fall from the skin as in glazed pottery-ware\r\n(? ἐπὶ τῶν ἁλμῶν τῶν κεραμίων). The affection is cured by internal\r\nphlegmagogues and external embrocations.” We have already on p. 139.\r\nabove, in the footnote on ἄγριος (wild, savage) and χαλεπός (hard,\r\nharsh), noted how these words are used with special reference to the\r\nvice of paederastia, but they are also applied generally to the vice,\r\nthe different forms of which we have been examining here. This follows\r\nfrom _Plato_[99] and _Plutarch_[100], at any rate so far as ἄγριος is\r\nconcerned, which indeed we may conveniently render by _vicious_. The\r\noriginal meaning being overlooked, λείχην and λιχὴν had been taken as\r\nsynonymous,—possibly the Latin _lichenos_ first led to the mistake;\r\nthen naturally enough an appropriate epithet was sought, to signify\r\nthe _lichen_ which was the result of licking in a vicious fashion. But\r\nthis according to the already existing mode of speech could be nothing\r\nelse than ἄγριος[101] again,—λειχὴν ἄγριος, with which λειχὴν ἁπλοῦς,\r\n_lichen insons_, (simple, innocent _lichen_) was naturally contrasted.\r\n\r\nYet while _Criton_, as cited in _Aëtius_, simply and quite\r\ncorrectly interpreted Mentagra by ἄγριος λειχὴν (fierce, malignant\r\nlichen), _Galen_ appears to have been still ignorant of the special\r\nmeaning. This is shown by the words ἥμερος and πρᾳότερος (gentle,\r\nbenignant,—milder), which obviously are correct opposites of ἄγριος\r\nonly _if_ the latter is understood, as it is in _Celsus_, as equivalent\r\nto _ferus_ (fierce, malignant), but in no way account for the ἁπλοῦς\r\n(simple, innocent), which Galen no doubt found already established as\r\ndistinguishing epithet of λιχὴν. How little he fathomed the nature of\r\nthe evil, is proved by his ætiology of it, which makes the complaint\r\nresult from the φλέγμα ἁλμυρὸν (salt phlegmatic humour) and the χολὴ\r\nξανθὴ (yellow gall). The unprofessional _Martial_ had a better word to\r\nsay on the subject when he wrote his _sordidique lichenes_ (filthy,\r\nsqualid-looking lichens). Similarly it would seem the _agra_ in\r\nMentagra should be taken as pointing to ἄγριος (fierce, malignant).\r\nCan it be perhaps that in this way the μολύνων τὴν ὑπήνην (polluting\r\nthe hair on the upper lip) of _Aristophanes_, the Latin _barbam\r\ninquinare_ (to pollute the beard), have come to be used as synonyms for\r\n_cunnilingere_? _Martial_ seems to imply it by his _triste mentum_,\r\n_mentum periculosum_ (disfigured chin, perilous chin). Perhaps too the\r\n_Sycosis menti_ (Sycosis,—fig-like eruption, of the chin) of _Celsus_\r\nand the later Greek medical writers should likewise be regarded as\r\ncoming under this head. At a matter of fact, _Archigenes_ says so in\r\nso many words, as cited in _Galen_ (De comp. med. secundum locos.\r\nBk. V. edit. Kühn Vol. XII. p. 847.), ἐπὶ δὲ τῶν _συκωδῶν τῶν ἐπὶ τοῦ\r\nγενείου, λεγομένων δὲ μενταγρῶν, ὑπὸ δέ τινων λειχήνων ἀγρίων_, ποιεῖ\r\nκ. τ. λ. (but in the case of the sycotic, or fig-like, eruptions\r\non the chin, which are called mentagrae, and by others malignant\r\nlichens, he proceeds as follows, etc.), and calls the affection of the\r\nchin, as do other Physicians, generally ἐξανθήματα ἐν τοῖς γενείοις\r\n(efflorescences, eruptions on the chin),—p. 824.\r\n\r\nIf we have thus succeeded in establishing the meanings of _lichens_\r\nand _mentagra_, the rest of the passage of _Pliny_ will admit of easy\r\nexplanation. The disease in many cases it seems invaded the whole\r\nface, in the same way as the _atra lues_ (black contagion) in the\r\npassages quoted above from _Martial_ under _fellation_. Perhaps all of\r\nthese,—indeed, _Pliny_ also says _lues_,—are the be referred, as is\r\nactually done by _Farnabius_ in his notes, to _mentagra_, seeing that\r\nthe disease could perfectly well, though certainly much seldomer, arise\r\nequally from the practise of _fellation_. The _double entendre_ between\r\n_mentum_ (the chin) and _menta_ or _mentula_ (the virile member) would\r\nso acquire all the more point.\r\n\r\nThe expression _foedo cutis furfure_ (with a horrible scurf of the\r\nskin) appears to have led a number of authors to believe that this was\r\nthe capital characteristic of the complaint, and that the distinction\r\nbetween λιχὴν and λείχην was merely one of degree. This view was\r\nadvocated in particular by _Willian_[102], who ascribes it also to\r\n_Paulus Aegineta_[103] as well as to _Oribasius_[104] though both of\r\nthese authors limit themselves to saying that the moderately siccative\r\nremedies are of no benefit in λείχην ἄγριος (malignant lichen), whereas\r\nthe more violent ones aggravate it, and that for this reason it was\r\ncalled ἄγριος. Hence Willian’s _Lichen agrius_ (malignant lichen) has\r\nnothing in common with the _lichen_ of the Greeks and Romans but the\r\nmere name, for it follows clearly from the words _foediore cicatrice_\r\n(with a more horrible scar) that occur a little further down in\r\n_Pliny_, that a process of skinning over by ulceration was part of the\r\ndisease, and did not owe its existence solely to the caustic remedies\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe _immunity of women_[105] equally admits of easy explanation, for\r\nin the first place women were not likely to have readily conceived\r\nthe idea of acting after the manner of a _cunnilingue_[106], and even\r\nif _fellation_ is admitted to be an occasionally concurrent cause of\r\n_mentagra_, still it would seem, as already stated, to supervene much\r\nless often as a consequence of the latter vice; while in cases where it\r\ndoes, it is of a milder form and it is rather the internal parts of the\r\nmouth that are imperilled. Besides, it is to be remembered that women\r\ngenerally speaking suffer less frequently from pustulous disorders of\r\nthe cutaneous glands affecting the face than men do, as is well seen at\r\nthe present day with Acne. In the parts neighbouring on the genitals\r\nthis is exactly reversed. Still this immunity of women must not be\r\ninsisted on too far, as those persons of the female sex who used to\r\npractise _fellation_, the Summoenianae (women of the suburbs) lay too\r\ncompletely outside the range of _Pliny’s_ observation.\r\n\r\nAs to the _servi_ (slaves) and _Plebs humilis_ (Commons of humble\r\nstation), these were surely unlikely, however little restraint they\r\nmay have put on their sensual appetites, to have readily fallen into\r\nsuchlike forms of vice,—forms which spring as a rule from the brain of\r\nunoccupied, rich idlers. We have only to appeal to modern experience\r\nto substantiate this. How many individuals of the lowest and middle\r\nclasses have the records of forensic medicine to show as having been\r\npaederasts and so on? Wild aberrations in morals have at no period\r\nbegun with the common man! So we see it was the Proceres (Nobles) who\r\nwere in an especial degree attacked by the _mentagra_.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the most conspicuous cause of _mentagra_, the practice\r\nof _cunnilingere_ was by no means the _only_ way of getting it, for\r\nthe malady, like _condylomata_ on the genital organs, was evidently\r\nconnected with a contagion,—a fact which is clearly enough brought\r\nout by the layman _Pliny_, whereas the Physicians say nothing about\r\nthis. Accordingly the disorder was capable of being disseminated by\r\n_kissing_ from one individual to another. But it was not the _velox\r\ntransitus osculi_ (swift transmission of a kiss) that was instrumental\r\nin spreading the disease, but rather the _basium_ (wanton kiss),—which\r\ndepended on some yet unidentified lascivious device[107], sucking,\r\nplaying with the tongue or the like. Still we must remember that at\r\nthe very time the _mentagra_ was spreading with such terrible rapidity,\r\na perfect _mania for kissing_ had broken out at Rome. _Martial_\r\ndescribes this admirably in the two following Epigrams, which are of\r\nthe very highest importance in connection with our subject:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Book XII. Epigram 59:_\r\n\r\nDE IMPORTUNIS BASIATORIBUS.\r\n\r\n    Tantum dat tibi Roma basiorum\r\n    Post annos modo quindecim reverso,\r\n    Quantum Lesbia non dedit Catullo.\r\n    Te vicinia tota, te pilosus\r\n    Hircoso premit osculo colonus.\r\n    Hinc instat tibi textor, inde fullo,\r\n    Hinc sutor modo pelle basiata,\r\n    Hinc _menti dominus periculosi_,\r\n    Hinc defioculusque et inde lippus,\r\n    Fellatorque recensque cunnilingus.\r\n    Iam tanti tibi non fuit redire.\r\n\r\n(_Of pestilent Kissers_: Rome bestows more kisses on you, on your\r\nreturn to her after fifteen years’ absence, than ever Lesbia gave\r\nCatullus. The whole neighbourhood kisses you, and the hirsute\r\ncountryman presses you in his goaty embrace. One side the weaver is\r\nupon you, the other the fuller, here the cobbler who but now kissed his\r\nleather; here comes _the owner of a perilous chin_, here the one-eyed\r\nman and here the blear, and the _fellator_, and the _cunnilingue_\r\nfresh from work. Now surely to return was not of such importance to you\r\nas all this.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Book XI. Epigram 98:_\r\n\r\nAD BASSUM.\r\n\r\n    Effugere non est, Basse, basiatores.\r\n    Instant, morantur, persequuntur, occurrunt\r\n    Et hinc et illinc, usquequaque, quacunque.\r\n    _Non ulcus acre pustulaeve lucentes_,\r\n    _Nec triste mentum sordidique lichenes_,\r\n    Nec labra pingui delibuta ceroto,\r\n    Nec congelati gutta proderit nasi.\r\n    Et aestuantem basiant et algentem,\r\n    Et nuptiale basium reservantem.\r\n    Non te cucullis asseret caput tectum,\r\n    Lectica nec te tuta pelle veloque,\r\n    Nec vindicabit sella saepius clausa.\r\n    Rimas per omnes basiator intrabit.\r\n    Non consulatus ipse, non tribunatus,\r\n    Saevique fasces, nec superba clamosi\r\n    Lictoris abiget virga basiatorem.\r\n    Sedeas in alto tu licet tribunali,\r\n    Et e curuli iura gentibus reddas:\r\n    Ascendet illa basiator atque illa:\r\n    Febricitantem basiabit et flentem:\r\n    Dabit oscitanti basium natantique,\r\n    Dabit et cacanti. Remedium mali solum est\r\n    Facias amicum, basiare quem nolis.\r\n\r\n(_To Bassus_: Escape the kissers, no! it is not to be done, Bassus.\r\nThey set upon you, wait for you, pursue you, meet you, here, there,\r\nand everywhere, in every street, at every corner. _Neither acrid ulcer\r\nnor shiny pustules, neither disfigured chin_ nor foul scabs, nor lips\r\nanointed with pink salve, nor the drop at the tip of a frozen nose will\r\nsave you. They kiss a man sweating with heat and starving with cold,\r\nnay! even a man keeping his lips pure for the nuptial kiss. A head\r\nmuffled in hoods will not exempt you, nor a litter guarded with rug\r\nand curtain, nor the sedan kept closed most of the time get you off.\r\nThe kisser will in by every chink. Not the very consulship, not the\r\ntribuneship, not the stern fasces and threatening rod of the shouting\r\nlictor will keep away the kisser. Though you sit exalted on the high\r\ntribunal, or give laws to the people from the curule seat, both to one\r\nand the other the kisser will climb up. He will kiss a man shaking with\r\nfever, and drivelling with cold. He will give a kiss to a man gaping,\r\nto a man swimming, even to a man shitting! The one and only cure for\r\nthe plague is to make a real friend, whom you will not need to kiss).\r\n\r\nNow we shall be in a position to explain to our satisfaction what\r\n_Martial_ meant by _basia lasciva_ (wanton kisses),—XI. 24.—_basia\r\nmaligna_ (pestilent kisses),—XII. 55.—and _Petronius_ (ch. 23.) by his\r\n_conspuere aliquem basio immundissimo_ (to beslobber anyone with a most\r\nfilthy kiss); and we shall be in no way surprised at the fact that\r\n_mentagra_ not only attacked the Roman nobles as a virtual epidemic,\r\nbut that the _velox transitus osculi_ (the swift transmission of a\r\nkiss) was alleged by Pliny as a reason of its communication.\r\n\r\nFinally as to the historical factor in connection with _mentagra_,—it\r\nis implied in the account Pliny gives that it was _only at Rome_ it\r\nwas regarded as a new disease. It must have been already known to\r\nthe Greeks, for they possessed the name _Lichen_ for it. The Greek\r\nphysicians, of whom several of the ones quoted by _Galen_ lived some\r\nconsiderable time before Claudius, know nothing about the disease being\r\na new one, while _Galen_ himself says simply, _ἐπικρατούσης_ ἐν τῇ\r\nπόλει τῆς μεντάγρας λεγομέμης, (when the _mentagra_ as it was called\r\n_was prevalent_ in the city). _Plutarch_ again, though he (Symposiaca\r\nbk. VIII. Quaest. 9.) wrote a special Chapter on new diseases, with\r\nparticular reference to Elephantiasis, never mentions _mentagra_ at\r\nall. He represents it as having been introduced into Rome from Asia,\r\nand it was from Egypt, the _Genetrix talium vitiorum_ (Mother-land\r\nof suchlike abominations), the Physicians[108] were imported who\r\nunderstood how to cure the disorder. We have more than once noted that\r\nAsia was the breeding place of sexual excesses, and described how vice\r\nspread from thence over different countries and how as a result of\r\nthese practices the affections of the parts naturally concerned that\r\narose first in Asia subsequently passed on to these same countries.\r\nFor Rome this was in an especial degree the case with Egypt, where the\r\nundermining of morality had gone farthest; _Martial_[109] spoke justly\r\nwhen he said “_Nequitias tellus scit dare nulla magis_,” (No other land\r\nknows better how to produce finished rascality). But the intercourse\r\nwith Asia and Egypt arose mainly in the time of Pompey, and became from\r\nthat period ever more active, while concurrently luxury was on the\r\nincrease and the old Virtus (manly virtue) of the Romans disappearing\r\nmore and more every day,—above all when Tiberius by his own example\r\nelevated every form of vice into a sort of fancy article demanded by\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nNot that the Emperor went unpunished, for he himself probably suffered\r\nfrom _mentagra_. _Julian_[110] says of him, that when Romulus had\r\ninvited to the feast of the Saturnalia all gods and Caesars, Tiberius\r\nappeared with the rest, “but when he turned round to take his seat,\r\non his back could be seen in thousands scars, marks of burnings and\r\nscrapings, indurated weals and callosities, results of his excesses\r\nand wild lusts, cankers and scabs as it were burnt in”. Nay! according\r\nto _Suetonius_[111] his face itself bore _crebri et subtiles tumores_\r\n(a multitude of minute swellings); and _Tacitus_[112] says of him:\r\n_Praegracilis et incurva proceritas, nudus capillo vertex, ulcerosa\r\nfacies, ac plerumque medicaminibus interstincta_, (Tall and of a\r\nmost graceful, albeit bowed, figure; the head bald, the face covered\r\n_with ulcers_, and generally patched with medical plasters). When\r\n_Galen_[113] mentions a τροχίσκος πρὸς ἕρπητας ὁ Τιβηρίου Καίσαρος (a\r\nlozenge for creeping eruptions, Tiberius Caesar’s), this does not in\r\nany way necessarily imply that this was prescribed as a remedy against\r\neruptive symptoms on the _face_, for Tiberius, as we see from the\r\npassage quoted from _Julian_, suffered from eruptions on all the other\r\nparts of his body. Even if an affection of the face was intended, the\r\nexpression ἕρπης (creeping eruption), in view of the marked tendency\r\nof the disease to spread to neighbouring parts, was not at all an\r\nunnatural one to be used; and we may say, speaking generally, that\r\nthe view which holds the Greeks to have indicated by the word ἕρπης\r\nany one definite and distinct form of eruption is entirely mistaken.\r\n_Bertrandi_[114] indeed endeavours to show that _mentagra_ was a form\r\nof malignant tetter. That the application of plasters as a remedy in\r\n_mentagra_ was frequently recommended and employed is shown both by\r\n_Galen_ and _Aëtius_[115].\r\n\r\nBut in proportion as the exciting cause grew ever more and more common,\r\nthe _cunnilingue_ being now no longer contented with girls, but\r\nemploying for the satisfaction of his shameful mania women and even\r\npregnant women as well, and at last actually women during menstruation,\r\nthe resulting consequences were bound to occur not only more frequently\r\nbut also in a more dangerous form. At first it was merely single\r\npustules, which appeared round the mouth and took possession of the\r\nchin, and which were confounded with _Sycosis menti_ (Sycosis,—fig-like\r\neruption of the chin), a complaint liable to arise from other causes\r\nas well and one long since familiar, without attracting particular\r\nattention as anything uncommon. Later on when neither morbid vaginal\r\nphlegm nor yet menstrual blood repelled the _cunnilingue_ any longer,\r\nthere was set up a diseased process in the cutaneous glands, the\r\nresulting secretion rapidly drying formed a white crust or scurf, and\r\nthis was detached in flakes resembling bran. All this could not fail to\r\narouse remark, and accordingly the Romans, little practised in medical\r\ndiagnosis, saw in it a new disease, which in turn received a new name.\r\nJust as in more modern times the introduction of Venereal disease was\r\nattributed to a leprous Knight from the Holy Land, so now at Rome\r\n_Perusinus, eques Romanus, Quaestorius scriba_ (Perusinus, a Roman\r\nknight, a secretary in the Quaestorian office) was held responsible\r\nfor bringing _mentagra_ from Asia. As a matter of fact he probably\r\ngot his _mentagra_ in Asia in exactly the same manner in which it was\r\nacquired in Rome,—if indeed we are on general grounds to give any\r\nweight to this part of the story. At any rate modern times have given\r\nus many examples of how much credence mankind is ready to give to an\r\naccount of the introduction of a disease by one definite individual.\r\nBut the disease did not stop at the cutaneous glands, the hair-glands\r\nwere also involved, the hair fell away, and ulcers formed, which spread\r\naround with destructive virulence, as was particularly the case in\r\nMartial’s day. On the other hand it is true deep-seated ulceration\r\nnever supervened, but the disease rather extended on the surface from\r\nthe face onwards, spreading more or less over the whole of the rest\r\nof the body[116], and thus assumed the form of Psora (Itch) or Lepra\r\n(Leprosy),—a phænomenon we shall have to return to once more later, its\r\nright appreciation being of the utmost importance for the History of\r\nVenereal Disease.\r\n\r\nNow, since on the one hand every _cunnilingue_ is not attacked by\r\n_mentagra_, while on the other sometimes ulcers of the inner portion\r\nof the mouth, sometimes _mentagra_, and the latter sometimes local,\r\nsometimes of wide extent, are noted, the following question calls\r\nfor an answer. What circumstances conditioned these phænomena and,\r\ngenerally, the special frequency of _mentagra_ in Italy? Leaving out of\r\naccount a variety of other considerations, we are bound in this place\r\nto call in along with other factors of our explanation some special\r\nand particular influence of the _Genius epidemicus_ (the aggregate of\r\nepidemical conditions at large), which just at that time favoured the\r\nrise of skin complaints. However slight the material Antiquity affords\r\nus on this point, and especially so far as concerns the time a little\r\nbefore and after Our Lord’s birth, still we _do_ find a datum for Italy\r\nat any rate which we certainly ought not to leave unutilized. This is\r\nthe statement of _Pliny_ (ch. 5. and Bk. XX. ch. 52.) to the effect\r\nthat it was in the time of Pompey the Great, or according to _Plutarch_\r\n(loco citato) in that of Asclepiades, that _elephantiasis_ first showed\r\nitself in Italy. It follows that at that period favourable external\r\ncircumstances also were in existence in connection with the conditions\r\nof disease at large,—as indeed the ready extension of _mentagra_ from\r\nthe chin onwards to the rest of the body proves even more clearly.\r\n\r\nBut it must not for a moment be supposed that therefore _mentagra_\r\nwas of _epidemic origin_. Without at all wishing to embark on the\r\nconsideration of the ætiological factors of _elephantiasis_, we may\r\njust mention the fact that according to Pliny’s account this disease\r\ntoo, equally with _mentagra_, would seem to have always begun with the\r\n_face_[117]. The conjecture is all but unavoidable, that very possibly\r\nin either case it was the practices of the _cunnilingue_ that supplied\r\nthe exciting cause for the misfortune; and this would also probably\r\nexplain how it was _elephantiasis_ came to be connected in men’s minds\r\nwith the _Morbus phoeniceus_ (Phoenician disease). Still, as already\r\nexplained, this would only be equivalent to making it responsible in\r\n_individual_ cases,—cases that tend inevitably to render the proper\r\nunderstanding of the action of _elephantiasis_, as well as of its\r\nhistory, considerably more difficult. May it not also be to some extent\r\nthe case that under the general name of _elephantiasis_ forms of\r\ndisease of very different sorts have been confounded? The views held\r\nby the Ancients on this and on the other skin diseases still remain in\r\ntoo much obscurity for anyone to be able to give a decisive judgement\r\non the point. For the rest most probably the _atra lues_ and _scelerata\r\nlues_ (black contagion, abominable contagion), spoken of above,\r\nlikewise come under the category of _mentagra_. This we have felt\r\nourselves constrained to ascribe not solely to the practise of the vice\r\nof the _cunnilingue_ as a cause, but to _fellation_ also,—only that in\r\nthe latter case, as we have pointed out, it is rather the inner, in the\r\nformer rather the external parts, that became affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nMorbus Campanus.\r\n\r\n(Campanian Disease).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 26.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the commentators on _Horace_, and particularly _Laevinus\r\nTorrentius_[118] have referred the much-discussed _Morbus\r\nCampanus_[119] to the head of _mentagra_; accordingly this will be no\r\ninappropriate place at any rate to mention it, though without aiming at\r\na complete explanation. _Horace_ represents two buffoons, _Messius_ and\r\n_Sarmentus_, as rallying each other for the amusement of the company:\r\n\r\n        — — Messi clarum genus Osci,\r\n    Sarmenti domina extat, ab his maioribus orti\r\n    Ad pugnam venere. Prior Sarmentus: _Equi te\r\n    Esse feri similem dico._ Ridemus: et ipse\r\n    Messius: _Accipio_; caput et movet. _O, tua cornu\r\n    Ni foret exsecto frons_, inquit, _quid faceres, cum\r\n    Sic mutilus miniteris?_ At illi foeda cicatrix\r\n    Setosam laevi frontem turpaverat oris.\r\n    _Campanum in morbum_, in faciem permulta iocatus\r\n    Pastorem saltaret uti Cyclopa, rogabat;\r\n    Nil illi larva aut tragicis opus esse cothurnis.\r\n    Multa Cicirrus ad haec.\r\n\r\n(Messius was sprung of the renowned race of the Oscans,\r\nSarmentus’ mistress is yet living; from these ancestors derived, they\r\ncame to the fray. First begins Sarmentus: “I declare you are just like\r\nan unbroken horse.” At this sally we laugh, and Messius himself says:\r\n“I accept the likeness,” and tosses his head. “Oh! if your horn had\r\nnot been amputated from your brow,” says he then, “what _would_ you\r\ndo, since you threaten us so fiercely, mutilated as you are?” Now an\r\nugly scar disfigured the left side of his shaggy brow. After making a\r\nnumber of jibes at his _Campanian disease_, and his face, he asked him\r\nto dance the shepherd Cyclops; saying there needed no mask and tragic\r\nbuskins. Many jests Cicirrus added as well).\r\n\r\nMessius who is chiefly spoken of in the above passage, is in the\r\nfirst place represented as an Oscan by birth. Now the whole race of\r\nthe Oscans was, as _Festus_ informs us, notorious for its unnatural\r\nexcesses in matters of Love; we read in him, p. 191: “_Obscum_ duas\r\ndiversas et contrarias significationes habet. Nam Cloatius putat eo\r\nvocabulo significari sacrum, quo etiam leges sacrae Oscae dicuntur, et\r\nin omnibus fere antiquis commentariis scribitur _Opicum_ pro Obsco, ut\r\nin Titini fabula quinta: Qui Obsce et Volsce fabulantur, nam Latine\r\nnesciunt. A quo etiam verba impudentia, et elata appellantur obscena,\r\n_quia frequentissimus fuit usus Oscis libidinum spurcarum_.” (_Obscum_\r\nhas two different and contrary meanings. For Cloatius considers\r\n_sacred_ to be signified by the word, in which sense sacred laws are\r\nspoken of as leges Oscae (_Oscan_ laws), and in almost all the old\r\ncommentaries _Opicum_ is written for _Obscum_, as in the fifth Fable\r\nof Titinius: “Who converse in _Obscan_ and Volscian, because they know\r\nnot how in Latin.” Whence also indecent words, and swelling ones,\r\nare called _obscene_, _because the practice of unclean lusts was most\r\nfrequent among the Oscans_[120].)\r\n\r\nAgain on p. 194., “Oscos, quos dicimus, ait Verrius Opscos ante dictos,\r\nteste Ennio, cum dicat: De muris res gerit Opscus. Adiicit etiam,\r\nquod _stupra inconcessae libidinis obscena dicantur, ab eius gentis\r\nconsuetudine inducta_. Quod verum esse non satis adducor, cum apud\r\nantiquos omnes fere obscena dicta sint, quae mali ominis habebantur.”\r\n(The _Oscans_, as we call them, Verrius says were formerly called\r\n_Opscans_, on the evidence of Ennius, for he says: “The Opscan directs\r\nhis attack upon the walls.” He adds further that _debaucheries of\r\nlawless love are called “obscene”, as taking this name from the habits\r\nof the nation in question_. But I am not sufficiently convinced of the\r\ntruth of this, inasmuch as in nearly all the ancient writers things\r\nare called _obscene_ that were held to be of evil omen). However\r\nwhat the _spurca libido_ (unclean lust) consisted in may be readily\r\nconjectured from the following explanations of _Festus_: _Oscines aves_\r\nAppius Claudius esse ait, quae _ore canentes_ faciant auspicium, ut\r\n_corvus_[121], cornix, noctua, (Divinatory birds—_Oscines_ aves—are,\r\nsays Appius Claudius, such as give an augury by _singing with the\r\nmouth_, as _the raven_, the crow, the owl); if only we remember\r\nhow the _fellator_, as was shown on a previous page, was nicknamed\r\n_corvus_ (raven). Again in an Epigram of _Ausonius_ already quoted a\r\n_cunnilingue_ is called _Opicus magister_; so that we cannot doubt the\r\nquestion is here of that vice which is practised with the mouth.\r\n\r\nIn another Epigram of _Ausonius_ quoted and explained above, where the\r\ndifferent forms of the _obscoena Venus_ (obscene Love) are specified,\r\nCrispa there mentioned practises,\r\n\r\n    _Et quam Nolanis capitalis luxus inussit_,\r\n\r\n(That vice too which headlong wantonness branded on the men of\r\nNola), and this _capitalis luxus_[122] of the men of Nola, as the\r\ngeneral sense of the whole passage clearly shows, is nothing else but\r\n_fellation_. But the town of Nola was in Campania, and the inhabitants\r\nof Campania again consisted for the most part of Oscans; so whatever\r\nis true of the latter, must needs also apply to the Campanians. The\r\nNolans and Oscans or Opicans being _fellators_ and _cunnilingues_, the\r\nCampanians must be so too; and as a matter of fact _Plautus_ (Trinum.\r\nII. 4. 144.) tells us: _Campas genus multo Syrorum antidit patientia_,\r\n(The Campanian race far outdoes that of the Syrians in _passivity_).\r\n\r\nNow Messius being represented as an Oscan, and this by way of mockery,\r\nas all expounders admit, the point of the jest must evidently refer\r\nto this _luxus capitalis_, and Messius accordingly be regarded as a\r\n_fellator_. Now let us look if this view finds any confirmation in\r\nwhat follows[123]. First of all Sarmentus says Messius is _equi feri\r\nsimilis_ (like an unbroken horse). Wherein precisely the satire of this\r\nconsists is indeed somewhat doubtful, the commentators maintaining\r\nan obstinate silence on the point; but there _must_ be some allusion\r\nof some sort intended. We can scarcely suppose this to be to the\r\n_Hectoreus equus_ (the Hectorean stallion) of Ovid[124] or the _equus\r\nsupinus_ (the stallion lying supine) of Horace,—Sat. II. 7. 50.[125].\r\nThe unbroken horse is noticeable as galloping with head down between\r\nthe fore-feet, a position taken, as we have already pointed out, by\r\nthe _cunnilingue_, but which in accordance with the passage of Lucian\r\nquoted above can equally well be that of the _fellator_[126]. Messius\r\nmust have understood the allusion, for he says, “_Accipio_”,—_caput et\r\nmovet_, (“I accept”,—and moves his head). Sarmentus takes the movement\r\nas a threat, for he in his turn understands the _equus ferus_ (wild\r\nhorse) in yet another sense as _aries_ (a ram)[127], and adds: If only\r\nyour horn had not been amputated! What should make you threaten to\r\nbutt, _mutilus_ (mutilated)[128] as you are?\r\n\r\nNow in explanation of what it was led Sarmentus to indulge in this\r\njest, Horace goes on to say that Messius carried on the left side\r\nof his brow a hideous scar. At this Sarmentus directs his wit,\r\nmaking allusion to the _Campanus morbus_ (Campanian disease) and\r\nMessius’ disfigured face, finishing up by asking the latter _pastorem\r\nsaltaret uti Cyclopa_ (to dance the shepherd Cyclops), adding that\r\nfor this he would need neither mask nor tragic buskins. But the\r\n_Campanus morbus_[129] is indeed nothing else but the _capitalis\r\nluxus_ (headlong wantonness) of the Nolans, the peculiar vice of the\r\nOscans, _fellation_ in fact, which Messius practised, and to which\r\nhe owed his _foeda cicatrix_ (hideous scar), his disfigured face;\r\nand on both these points Sarmentus proceeds to rally him at great\r\nlength (_permulta iocatus_,—indulging in very many jests), without\r\nHorace however recording his wit any further. In the _pastorem Cyclopa\r\nsaltare_ (to dance the shepherd Cyclops) again is contained an allusion\r\nthat has hitherto been quite misunderstood, one which _Lucian_ in\r\nhis Pseudologistae (ch. 27.) will best explain for us. He says to\r\nTimarchus: “But in Italy, great gods! you acquired the heroic nickname\r\nof ὁ Κύκλωψ (the Cyclops), because at one time you wanted to practise\r\nyour vice in imitation of the old legend, as it is found in _Homer_,\r\nand actually, as you lay there drunk, held the κισσύβιον (wassail-bowl)\r\nin your hand like a wanton Polyphemus; and the young man hired for the\r\npurpose with outstretched _hasta_ (spear), that was well sharpened,\r\nthrew himself upon you like another Odysseus, to thrust out your\r\neye[130].\r\n\r\n    Yet did he miss his aim, and the spear turned slantwise beside you;\r\n    So that its point sped past, the edge of your chin merely grazing.\r\n\r\nThus it is by no means unreasonable to speak of you as using\r\n“cold-mouthed phrases” (Ψυχρολογεῖν). But you, Cyclops, opening your\r\nmouth, and gaping as wide as mortal man can, had your cheeks plugged\r\nby him, or better you longed, as Charybdis with the ships was fain to\r\nswallow down helm and sail and all, you longed to absorb the whole\r\nΟὖτις (No-man).”\r\n\r\nFinally the nickname Messius bears, _Cicirrus_ or _Cicerrus_, would\r\nseem to embody a jesting allusion, as it was no doubt given him on\r\naccount of his throaty, croaking voice. It signifies the same thing as\r\nκερκίδες (hawks) in Dio Chrysostom, and like that word is to be derived\r\nfrom κέρχω (to croak)[131].\r\n\r\nThe _Morbus Phoeniceus_ (Phoenician disease) was not, as we have seen,\r\nelephantiasis at all, and neither was the _Morbus Campanus_ (Campanian\r\ndisease) mentagra. But just as elephantiasis might supervene as a\r\nconsequence of _Morbus Phoeniceus_, so the _foeda cicatrix_ (hideous\r\nscar), a mark left behind it by a previous malady, was a consequence\r\nof the _Morbus Campanus_. Now what was the nature of this malady that\r\nthe mark it left behind showed as a _foeda cicatrix_, is precisely\r\nwhat we would wish to determine. The Commentators all take the _cornu\r\nexsectum_ (a horn amputated) as giving the explanation, though this is\r\nby no means absolutely necessary according to the general drift of the\r\npassage as explained; and Sarmentus might perfectly well under these\r\ncircumstances, arguing from the presence of a scar, assume or at any\r\nrate profess to assume as the cause from which this had originated,\r\nthe previous existence of a horny excrescence, without the latter as\r\nan actual matter of fact having ever had any previous existence. To\r\nus at any rate the _cornu exsectum_ appears to stand in only a remote\r\nconnection with the _foeda cicatrix_, which was no doubt later on made\r\nthe subject of manifold further witticisms; only Horace has given us no\r\nmore details about the matter, either because they had entirely escaped\r\nhis memory, or possibly because he had not perfectly grasped the point\r\nof these jokes. Certainly the conspicuously placed _at_ (but) seems to\r\npoint to a distinction of what follows from what precedes—unless indeed\r\nit is so placed merely to mark the transition from the _oratio directa_\r\nto the _oratio indirecta_.\r\n\r\nHowever, granted there actually was an excrescence previously existing,\r\nwhich had been removed by the knife, of what nature was the said\r\nexcrescence? It is scarcely possible, with Heindorf, to suppose the\r\nSatyriasis of Aristotle[132] to be intended here; with much greater\r\nprobability _Schneider_ in his Greek Dictionary, under the word\r\nδιονυσιακὸς (Dionysiac, connected with Dionysus) drew attention to the\r\ndefinition of _Galen_ (edit. Kühn XIX. p. 443.): διονυσίσκοι εἰσὶν\r\nὀστώδεις ὑπεροχαὶ ἐγγὺς κροτάφων γιγνόμεναι. λέγονται δὲ κέρατα ἀπὸ\r\nτῶν κερασφορούντων ζάων κεκλημένα. (διονυσίσκοι are bony excrescences\r\ngrowing near the temples, and they are called horns, so named from\r\nthe animals that carry horns). A passage of _Heliodorus_ (_Cocchi\r\nAnt., Graecorum chirurgici libri, e collect. Nicetae Florent._ 1754.\r\nfol., p. 125.) which _Oribasius, De fracturis_, has preserved, gives\r\na slightly different account; it reads: Ὀστώδης ἐπίφυσις ἐν παντὶ μὲν\r\nγίγνεται μέρει τοῦ σώματος, πλεοναζόντως δὲ ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ, μάλιστα\r\nδὲ πλησίον τῶν κροτάφων·Ὅταν δὲ δύο ἐπιφύσεις γένωνται πλησιάζουσαι\r\nτοῖς κροτάφοις, κέρατα ταῦτα τινες εἴωθασιν ὀνομάζειν, ἔνιοι δὲ\r\n_διονυσιακοὺς_ τοὺς οὕτω πεπονθότας ἀνθρώπους προσηγόρευσαν. (Bony\r\noutgrowth may occur in every part of the body, but pre-eminently on\r\nthe head, and particularly near the temples. But when there are two\r\nsuch growths in the neighbourhood of the temples, some are wont to call\r\nthem _horns_, but others name the patients so afflicted διονυσιακοὶ).\r\nThen follows the description of the outgrowth, and the method of its\r\nremoval by excision. On this passage _Cocchi_ found an old marginal\r\ngloss from the hand of Nicotas (?), κέρατα μὲν λέγεται ἀπὸ τῆς τῶν\r\nκεράτων ἐκφύσεως, τῶν γιγνομένων τοῖς ἀλόγοις ζώοις. _Διονυσιακοὺς_ δὲ\r\nαὐτοὺς προσαγορεύουσιν, ἀπὸ τῆς πρὸς τὸν θεὸν ἐμφερείας _ὡς αὐτός_\r\nφησιν ἐν τοῖς χειρουργουμένοις,—(they are called horns from the growth\r\nof the horns that appear on the lower animals. And they name them\r\nδιονυσιακοὶ from the likeness to the god Dionysus, as he says himself,\r\nin the carved figures),—which on the whole confirms the statement of\r\nHeliodorus, though he (Cocchi) prefers, following this indication,\r\nto emend the passage of Galen also so as to read, διονυσιακοί, _οἷς_\r\nὀστώδεις ὑπεροχαὶ ἐγγὺς κροτάφων _γίγνονται_, (Dionysiaci, so they are\r\ncalled, i. e. those in whom bony excrescences grow near the temples).\r\nThis much, that we should read διονυσιακοὶ for διονυσίσκοι, is evident,\r\nbut whether the rest of the emendations are to be accepted may well\r\nbe open to doubt, as the second clause of the sentence, “and they are\r\ncalled κέρατα (horns), so named from the animals that carry horns”,\r\nobviously implies that the term διονυσιακοὶ is used in reference not to\r\nthe individual, but to the outgrowth. Schneider indeed agrees with the\r\nemendation of Cocchi, but has in error put Sarmentus in the place of\r\nMessius.\r\n\r\nNow supposing the latter has actually had an earlier bony outgrowth,\r\nit is not exactly evident why after its skilful removal a _foeda\r\ncicatrix_ (hideous scar) should have remained,—if indeed we do not\r\nprefer to regard the _foedus_ (hideous, foul) as perhaps pointing to\r\nthe _cause_ that had occasioned the outgrowth in question. In that case\r\nit would certainly be interesting to see thus referred to the vice of\r\nthe _fellator_ affections of the bones carrying the same meaning as our\r\nown tophi (concretions on the bone in gouty affections). But in all\r\nprobability it was merely cutaneous tubercles that had been removed\r\nby surgical means, the actual cautery or the knife, and these, as is\r\ninvariably their nature to do, had left behind an ugly scar. Thus\r\nMessius would seem to have resembled Calvus _tuberossimae frontis_\r\n(with brow most thickly covered with tubercles) in Petronius (ch. 15.)\r\nand the face represented on a gem, of which a delineation is said to be\r\nfound in _Corius’_ Museum Etruriae Plate II. fig. 3.,—a work we have\r\nbeen unable to procure. But enough of the Morbus Campanus[133]!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSodomy, or Bestiality.\r\n\r\n§ 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the various forms of vice hitherto considered we have seen mankind\r\napproximating more and more closely to the animal and putting himself\r\nto a greater or less degree on the same footing; now we behold him in\r\n_Sodomy_[134] sinking finally far _below_ the level of the animal,\r\nrenouncing not merely the human but even the animal nature, in virtue\r\nof which he has been able so far to call himself at lowest a member of\r\nthe species. So it is with complete justice that _Plutarch_[135] says:\r\n“At gallus si gallum conscendat absente gallina, vivus comburitur,\r\naruspice aliquo pronuntiante grave atroxque id esse ostentum. Ita\r\nipsi homines hoc confessi sunt, castitate a brutis se superari, eaque\r\nnaturae vim non facere voluptatum percipiendarum causa. Vestras\r\nlibidines natura, quamquam legis auxilio fulta, tamen intra suos non\r\npotest coercere fines: quin eae instar fluvii exundantes atrocem\r\nfoeditatem, tumultum confusionemque naturae gignant in re venerea. Nam\r\net capras, porcas, equas iniverunt viri, et feminae insano mascularum\r\nbestiarum amore exarserunt. Ex huiusmodi enim coitibus vobis sunt\r\nMinotauri, Silvani seu Aegipanes atque (ut mea fert sententia) etiam\r\nSphinges et Centauri nati[136]. Enimvero fame coactus canis aut avis\r\naliquando cadavere humano vescitur; ad coitum nullus unquam est homo a\r\nbestia sollicitatus, bestias vero cum ad hanc, tum ad alias voluptates\r\nvos vi trahitis ac contra jus usurpatis.” (But if the cock tread\r\nthe cock in the absence of the hen, he is burned alive, any augur\r\npronouncing this to be a serious and sinister prodigy. Thus men have\r\nthemselves admitted that they are surpassed by brutes in chastity,\r\nand that the latter do not do violence to nature with a view to the\r\ngratification of their desires. Whereas your lusts nature cannot,\r\nthough seconded by the aid of law, restrain within their due bounds, or\r\nstay them from overflowing like a river in flood and producing horrid\r\nabominations, a wild cataclysm and confusion of nature in matters of\r\nlove. For men have had intercourse with she-goats and sows and mares,\r\nwhile women have been inflamed with mad love of male beasts. Indeed\r\nit is from such unions that your Minotaurs have been engendered,\r\nand Silvani or Aegipans, and—as I suppose,—the Sphinxes too and\r\nCentaurs[136]. True under compulsion of hunger, dog and bird sometimes\r\nfeed on a human corpse; but no man has ever been invited to coition by\r\nany beast, though you constrain beasts by force to this as well as to\r\nother shameful pleasures, and use them contrary to all right).\r\n\r\nLike all other forms of vicious lust, Sodomy too was an outcome of\r\nAsiatic[137] and Egyptian luxury, and already in quite early times\r\nfamiliar in those regions,—in fact, as is the case with sexual excesses\r\ngenerally, this vice appears to have developed from the religious cult\r\nof the countries named. Among the Egyptians[138] at any rate we meet\r\nwith Mendes, the sacred Goat or Pan, worshipped by means of Sodomy on\r\nthe part of his female devotees, who were shut up along with him.\r\n\r\n_Boettiger_[139] goes so far as to conjecture that the tame snakes\r\nin the temple of Aesculapius, which were also kept in private\r\nhouses[140] as a plaything of the women, were trained and employed\r\nby them for purposes of Sodomy. In confirmation a passage is brought\r\nforward in this connection by _Forberg_, loco citato, p. 368, from\r\n_Suetonius_[141], in which the mother of Augustus, Atia, is spoken\r\nof: “In Asclepiadis Mendetis Θεολογουμένων libris lego, Atiam cum\r\nad sollemne Apollinis sacrum media nocte venisset, posita in templo\r\nlectica, dum ceterae matronae dormirent, obdormisse; draconem repente\r\nirrepsisse ad eam paulloque post egressum: illamque expergefactam\r\n_quasi a concubitu mariti purificasse se_ et statim in corpore eius\r\nexstitisse maculam, velut depicti draconis, nec potuisse unquam\r\neximi, adeo ut mox publicis balneis perpetuo abstinuerit”[142]. (In\r\nthe books of the _Theologoumena_ (sacred writings) of the Asclepiad\r\nMendes I read how Atia, who had come to the wonted festival of Apollo\r\nat midnight, when her litter had been set down in the Temple, and\r\nthe other matrons were sleeping, herself fell asleep; how a snake\r\nsuddenly crept in to her, and presently emerged again; and how on\r\nwaking she _purified herself as after intercourse with her husband_,\r\nand immediately there appeared a mark on her body, representing the\r\nlikeness of a snake, which could never be got rid of, so much so that\r\nsoon she left off ever after frequenting the public baths).\r\n\r\nHowever the Roman women seem to have especially made use of the\r\nass[143] for the satisfaction of their _nymphomania_, an animal that\r\nwas famed in Antiquity for its salaciousness.\r\n\r\nThat under such circumstances the women’s genitals, and the men’s no\r\nless, were exposed to many sorts of injury, may be readily supposed;\r\nthough we have sought in vain so far for any direct evidence of\r\nthe fact. So we may perhaps be allowed to quote here an observation\r\noriginating with _Abu Oseibah_, De vitis medicorum illustrium, (On\r\nthe Lives of Famous Physicians), according to _Reiske_[144]. This\r\nproperly speaking belongs to a later period chronologically, but it is\r\npertinent in the present connection. Reiske says: “Caput XIII. habet\r\nobservationem—2. de ingenti _penis inflammatione, quae nata fuerat ex\r\nimpuro cum bestia concubitu_, cum coruncula urethram obstruente, sanata\r\nmodo prorsum empirico atque crudeli. Impositum glabro lapidi penem\r\nmedicus subito praeter aegri expectationem, qua poterat vi percutiebat\r\nmanu in pugnum coacta, ut obturaculum et ulcus dissiliret. Sapit hic\r\ncasus _luem veneream_; et posset inservire illis pro argumento, qui\r\nmorbum hunc etiam veteribus cognitum fuisse contendunt. Cadit autem is\r\ncasus circa annum Christi 940.” (Chapter XIII contains the following\r\nobservation,—2. Of a violent _inflammation of the penis, which had\r\noriginated in unclean intercourse with a beast_, with a coruncle, or\r\nknot, constricting the urethra, cured in a manner to the last degree\r\nempirical and cruel. The penis being laid on a rough stone, the\r\nPhysician suddenly when the patient was not expecting it, struck it as\r\nheavily as ever he could with his doubled fist, so that the stoppage\r\nand ulcer might burst. This case has a smack of the _Venereal disease_\r\nabout it; and might serve as an argument for those who hold that this\r\ndisease was known to the Ancients as well. But the case falls about the\r\nyear of Our Lord 940.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClimate.\r\n\r\n§ 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we have made ourselves acquainted with the various use\r\nto which the Ancients put the genital organs, we are confronted\r\ninevitably with the question,—how were the genitals themselves\r\naffected by it all? Impossible to suppose they can have preserved\r\ntheir integrity absolutely intact, while at the same time such parts\r\nas were substituted in use for the one or the other form of them,\r\nwere exposed,—as is abundantly proved by the different diseases\r\ndescribed, diseases affecting the _pathic_, the _fellator_ and the\r\n_cunnilingue_ respectively,—to manifold complaints, and very often\r\nhad to pay severely for the misuse to which they were put. Granting\r\nthat the unnatural use of the mouth and the rectum must necessarily\r\nhave endangered those parts specifically more than the penis, an organ\r\nparticularly adapted and intended for friction, still this will by no\r\nmeans imply the entire immunity of the latter from ill effects. Indeed\r\nthe fact of such immunity is sufficiently disproved by the passages\r\nquoted specifically under paederastia, without taking into account\r\nat all the large number of actual maladies of the genitals that are\r\nmentioned by professional and non-professional writers of Antiquity.\r\nWith some of these we have already made acquaintance,—maladies which no\r\none would for a moment think of ascribing _exclusively_ to the practice\r\nof the vice of paederastia.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we must look for other factors, which being in part\r\nunconnected with the use of the genitals, are not like this to be\r\nregarded as an immediately efficient cause, but rather as predisposing\r\ncircumstances, exercising from the first an independent influence on\r\nthe normal condition of those organs. For mere use or misuse cannot\r\npossibly be taken as in itself a sufficient reason to account for\r\ndisease, even though the Ancients may have looked upon complaints\r\nof the genitals partly as a direct consequence of _illicita Venus_\r\n(unlawful Love), or in other words as it were a result of the vengeance\r\nof outraged Nature. The genitals, like all organs of the human body,\r\nexhibit over and above their functional activity on behalf of the\r\ngeneral organism and its reproduction, evidences also of an independent\r\nactivity directed towards the maintenance of their own integrity\r\nand individual existence,—and these are bound to differ more or\r\nless according to difference of locality and difference of time, as\r\nindeed may be predicated of the organism as a whole, if we trust the\r\nindications it gives.\r\n\r\nNow this differentiation according to locality is conditioned above\r\nall else by climate; hence the question we have now first of all to\r\nanswer is this: _what influence did climate manifest in Ancient times\r\non the activity of the genital organs in general and in particular?_\r\nand, _to what extent may a factor favourable to the rise of affections\r\nof the genitals be deduced from it?_ True, direct information on the\r\npoint has so far reached us only sparingly, still such as we have is\r\nenough to justify a general view on the whole question, especially if\r\nwe reinforce it with the results of more recent observation,—always\r\nprovided this be done with proper precaution, for we sometimes find\r\nthe Ancients commending the climate of a particular country as being\r\nexceedingly healthy, whereas in more modern times exactly the opposite\r\nis noted. As the evidence extant and available extends only to Asia,\r\nand in particular Syria, Palestine and Asia Minor, to Egypt, Greece\r\nand Italy, there can for the present be no question except as to the\r\nclimate of these countries.\r\n\r\nNext as to _the influence of sexual activity in general_,\r\n_Hippocrates_[145] himself tells us, after discussing the climate\r\nof Asia: “But ἡδονή (pleasure) must necessarily predominate (among\r\nthem), and this is why among animals so many varieties are found; and\r\nI suppose this to be equally true in the case of the Egyptians and\r\nLydians also.” Of course ἡδονή in this passage signifies concupiscence\r\nin particular;—no special proof is needed of this. As a matter of fact\r\nwe observe at the present day how in hot climates, where the whole\r\nvegetative life presents a luxuriant character, and all Nature appears\r\nto feel the procreative impulse unceasingly, man too falls in with the\r\nuniversal stress and strain of each species to maintain its foothold.\r\nYet as this must inevitably be done at the expense of the individual\r\nlife, we see the effort very frequently resulting in the production of\r\nbarren or sexless blossoms, and not fruit at all. The son of the South\r\nis like a tree growing in rich, rank soil; he ripens betimes to the\r\nsexual life, but equally early is constrained to abandon it again. The\r\nyouthful imagination springs up in its fresh quick activity, while the\r\nbody withers concurrently, and stung by lust,—lust that is yet further\r\nexaggerated by the misuse of _aphrodisiacs_, at last has nothing left\r\nbut to drag out an invalid existence, finding a morbid gratification\r\nin the artificial ways and means whereby imagination, sickened and\r\ndebauched by its own extravagances, seeks to supply from extraneous\r\nsources the failing titillation of desire the organ craves. No better\r\nconfirmation of all this can be found than what is supplied already in\r\nour investigations as so far conducted.\r\n\r\nWe saw how in Asia lust and its abominable brood arose and extended\r\nthence over neighbouring lands, and how the rhythmic rites of the\r\n_Venus ebria_ (drunken Venus) could indeed refine, but hardly\r\nincrease their excesses. Babylon, Syria and Egypt were the nurseries\r\nof licentiousness, finding only at Rome a really self-taught and\r\ncompetent rival. The clear sky of Greece could cover only inhabitants\r\nof corresponding character in body and mind, and none but a Greek\r\nwas capable of setting up the ideal, and verifying it in practice,\r\nof a fair soul in a fair body. Deep as the Greek may have sunk in\r\ndegradation after the fall of national liberty and under foreign\r\ninfluence, and though unbridled lust may have often mastered\r\nindividuals, it never dominated the nation as a whole, it was\r\nartificially brought into existence and was never dependent on climate.\r\nEven at Rome, colossal as was the scale on which vice manifested\r\nitself, it ever remained but a foreign importation, for which foreign\r\nwantons had first paved the way at a period when the climate of Asia\r\nexerted a more immediate influence there than that of Greece.\r\n\r\nLike licentiousness in general, Polygamy also, in part owing its\r\nexistence to it as it does, was a consequence of the Asiatic climate;\r\nbut how far it may be fairly held to have influenced the rise of\r\nVenereal disease, we do not as yet venture to decide; we feel\r\nconstrained to keep this point over for later investigations. The same\r\napplies to Polyandry,—in its strict sense, when we regard it as a\r\nform of marriage; though of course over and above this it comes into\r\nconnection with vice, inasmuch as every prostitute lives in a state of\r\nPolyandry, as does every amateur of the sex in one of Polygamy. Under\r\nthese circumstances affections of the genitals cannot but arise among\r\npersons otherwise healthy, as every Physician of large practice can\r\nverify by examples, and as experiments on animals have sufficiently\r\ndemonstrated to be the case[146]. Nevertheless these hints, for we\r\ncannot and ought not to look upon them as anything more than hints,\r\nas any more complete discussion would carry us too far a-field for\r\nour present purpose,—may very well suffice to recall to the reader’s\r\nmemory the influence exerted by climate on the genital functions,\r\nespecially as adequate proofs in confirmation of all this are comprised\r\nin our preceding Sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 29.\r\n\r\nFar more important in view of our immediate object is the _influence\r\nexerted by Climate on the individual activity of the genital organs_,\r\nand here again we have in the first place to fix our eyes on Asia and\r\nEgypt. The burning rays of the sun to which these regions and their\r\ninhabitants are exposed, increase in a marked way the activity of the\r\nskin, and of course in the same proportion do the secretions from the\r\nmucous surfaces become less in quantity, but their product more highly\r\ncharged in quality. Then, this being the case, a certain acridity or\r\ncorroding quality of the secretion is readily set up, often making\r\nitself noticeable by a characteristic smell. This same influence\r\nmust equally manifest itself in the mucous membrane of the inner\r\nparts of the genitals, and vaginal mucus accordingly acquire an acrid\r\nquality[147], if it is not removed pretty frequently from the surface\r\nof the membrane, and becoming as it were rancid, exert a corrosive\r\neffect on everything it comes in contact with[148].\r\n\r\nNow shortly before as well as shortly after the commencement of\r\nmenstruation the secretion of mucus in the genitals is increased,\r\nand thus the menstrual blood, having in any case a tendency to\r\ndecomposition, will mingle with this acrid, strong-smelling mucous\r\ndischarge, and in this way assume a foul, acrid character itself[149].\r\nThis is the origin of the ill repute into which menstrual blood, and\r\nthis especially in hot climates, has fallen from the earliest times\r\nonwards, for no doubt the virulent qualities alleged against it really\r\nbelong to it solely and entirely as a result of the admixture with it\r\nof this vaginal mucus. Sea-water and fresh river-water are each of them\r\nseparately innocuous for health, but mix them together so as to make\r\nbrackish water, and the exhalations given off become highly detrimental!\r\n\r\nA similar state of things exists also in connection with the male\r\ngenital organs. The surface of the _glans penis_, where it lies\r\ncontiguous to the external skin, exhibits along with the latter an\r\nincreased secretion from the sebaceous follicles[150], the discharge\r\nfrom which, if it is allowed to remain any length of time between\r\nthe prepuce and the _glans_[151], likewise acquires an acrid quality;\r\nthen re-acting on these parts, sets up an inflammatory condition of\r\nthe aforesaid sebaceous follicles. “In fact”, says _Niebuhr_[152] “the\r\nMedical Officer of the English at Haleb (Russel) ascertained that in\r\nhot countries more copious humours collect about the _glans penis_ than\r\nin cold; and a friend of mine in India, who in that hot climate had\r\nemployed only the ordinary European precautions to ensure cleanliness,\r\ngot a sort of ulcers on the _glans_, an inconvenience he would have\r\nbeen much more likely to escape, had he been circumcised. Subsequently\r\nhe always washed this part of his person very carefully, and from\r\nthat time forth experienced no trace of a recurrence of the trouble.\r\nWashing the whole body and particularly the privates is an absolute\r\nnecessity in hot countries; and it is perhaps for this reason that the\r\nreligious founders of the Jews, the Mohammedans, the Fire-Worshippers,\r\nthe Heathen in India, etc., have commanded the observation of this\r\npractice.”\r\n\r\nIn close accord with this is the story _Flavius Josephus_[153] relates\r\nof _Apion_ the Egyptian: “Wherefore it appears to me Apion deservedly\r\npaid a fitting penalty for his scorn of ancestral customs; for only\r\nwhen forced by necessity was he circumcised, ulceration having been\r\nset up about his privates (his _glans penis_); and as a matter of fact\r\nthe circumcision proved vain, for gangrene supervened, and he died in\r\nterrible pain.” Again the passage just quoted will also afford a clear\r\nunderstanding of the following from _Philo_[154]:\r\n\r\n“Therefore were it more becoming, quitting childish and frivolous\r\nmockery altogether, intelligently and earnestly to investigate the\r\ncauses in which this custom (Circumcision) originated, rather than\r\nto accuse whole nations of folly in a spirit of mere prejudice.\r\nIt certainly does not seem probable to an intelligent enquirer,\r\napproaching the question in this mood, that so many thousands of\r\nfolk in every age should have been circumcised without a sufficient\r\ncause, submitting to great pain merely to mutilate their own and\r\ntheir children’s bodies. On the other hand there are many inducements\r\nto adopt outright and follow up the custom of our forefathers; and\r\nin an especial degree the four following. First, _the prevention of\r\na virulent disease and one very difficult to cure_. This is known\r\nas _Anthrax_,—a denomination derived, as I suppose, from the ardent\r\n(fierce) burning (ἀπὸ τοῦ καίειν ἐντυφόμενον) that accompanies it,\r\nand _readily arises in such as have the foreskin intact_. Secondly, to\r\nsecure that purity of the whole person obligatory upon the Priestly\r\ncaste. Whence it comes that the Priests in Egypt also scrupulously\r\nshave the whole body; for there is something collects and is deposited\r\nunderneath the hair as well as under the foreskin, that must be\r\nremoved.”\r\n\r\nFrom a comparison of these two passages from Niebuhr and from Philo\r\nrespectively it may be gathered that the _anthrax_ disease above\r\nmentioned did not in any way owe its rise to a _specifically_\r\nsyphilitic origin, as has been now and again assumed by different\r\nenquirers. What we really learn from them is to recognize the liability\r\nof the sebaceous follicles of the _glans penis_ to lapse into a\r\ncondition of ulceration. True this tendency can be minimised to some\r\nextent by circumcision, as well as by unremitting care to secure\r\ncleanliness; yet it can never be completely removed, conditioned as\r\nit really is by climatic influences that do not admit of elimination.\r\nWhen once the corroding vaginal mucus of the woman, particularly in\r\ncombination with the menstrual blood with its readiness to undergo\r\nputrefaction[155] re-acting on the mucous membrane, has set up sores\r\nand ulcers, then follows as a necessary consequence a still more\r\ndangerous mixture of matter and mucus. Next when under these conditions\r\nthe man’s _glans_, possessing as it does an equally great liability in\r\nits cutaneous glands to be attacked by ulceration, enters in coition a\r\nvagina in this state, it cannot occasion much surprise if blennorhoea\r\nof the urethra or ulceration of the _glans penis_ supervene[156],\r\nespecially if we consider the fact that the act of coition sets the\r\norgans concerned in enhanced activity, making them more susceptible\r\nthan ever to external injurious irritations. This is yet more likely to\r\nbe the case, as concurrently a large amount of secretion is yielded by\r\nthe morbidly affected mucous surface of the vagina, and very possibly\r\nthis secretion undergoes under the influence of nervous excitation (as\r\nthe saliva does under the influence of anger) some vital-chemical,\r\ncontagious alteration of composition. Again supposing the woman to be\r\nat the time of coition actually in menstruation, a period when her\r\ngenital organs are _ipso facto_ roused to a condition of exaggerated\r\nactivity, the disturbance must be yet greater, and the mischief\r\nresulting even more manifest.\r\n\r\nThis will in part account for the fact that ulcers on the genitals,\r\nbrought about by coition, are so ready in Asia to assume a putrid\r\ncharacter, and show that the Ancients had good reason to designate them\r\nby the name ἄνθραξ (anthrax, malignant pustule). For that ἄνθραξ was\r\nactually a consequence of coition we may see from a passage, already\r\ncited by Hensler and Simon, from Bishop _Palladius_[157], who relates\r\nof a certain Hero, how the Demon led him to Alexandria, how he there\r\nvisited theatres and horse-races, and roamed round the taverns. “And\r\nthus, being by this time a glutton and a drunkard, he _fell moreover\r\ninto the mire of lust after women_; and being now set upon sinning,\r\n_he lived with a certain actress_, (and had carnal intercourse with\r\nher?). _Then when he had done all this, by a (Divine) providence he\r\ngot an “anthrax” on the glans penis; and was so sick for six months\r\nthat his (private) parts rotted away and dropped off of themselves._\r\nBut subsequently recovering and getting off with the loss of these\r\nmembers, coming to a knowledge of God and a remembrance of the heavenly\r\nkingdom, and after confessing all that had befallen him, he fell asleep\r\na few days afterwards, without having had the time to manifest works\r\n(of repentance).” In spite of the difficulties some of the expressions\r\nin the text exhibit, the main fact is perfectly plain, and admits of\r\nno doubt whatever, viz. that Hero had brought the ἄνθραξ on himself by\r\ncarnal intercourse with an actress, and the moral reflections Palladius\r\ntags on to it cannot invalidate the fact. The objections _Astruc_\r\nraises against the conclusiveness of the passage have already been\r\nrefuted by _Hensler_ (Geschichte der Lustseuche,—History of Venereal\r\nDisease, I. pp. 317 sqq.), who while citing as parallel instances the\r\npassages adduced by _Becket_ from the early XVth Century, very justly\r\nremarks: “What proof _would_ they have, if this is not conclusive?”\r\n\r\nDid the female genitals perhaps receive the names ἐσχάρα (scab) and\r\nἄνθραξ (malignant pustule), _because_ they very often made men a\r\npresent of these things?!\r\n\r\nIn any case it is an interesting fact that to this day in India\r\n_anthrax_ and chancrous ulcers are looked upon as akin, and both\r\naccording to _Sir William Jones_ (Asiatic Researches Vol. II.) are\r\nknown by the name Nar Farsi or Ateshi Farsi (_Ignis Persicus_—Persian\r\nFire) to the Cabirajas or Indian physicians. Now if we think of the\r\ngreat care taken by the Jews to ensure the multiplication of their\r\nrace, the readiness with which various forms of ulceration pass over\r\ninto mortification in hot localities,—as is shown by the examples of\r\nApion and Hero,—and consequently the serious liability of the organs\r\nof generation to be destroyed, it will occasion less surprise when we\r\nread among the laws of _Moses_[158] the following injunction: “And if a\r\nman shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her\r\nnakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the\r\nfountain of her blood; and both of them shall be cut off from among\r\ntheir people.” Surely great and serious resulting injuries must in no\r\ninconsiderable number of instances have been before his eyes for a\r\nLawgiver to feel himself constrained to assign the death penalty to\r\nthe act of coition with women during menstruation,—and this in spite\r\nof the fact that he had already in a general way declared the woman\r\nat this time, as well as everything she touched, to be unclean. Again\r\non the other hand coition with women in this condition must with the\r\nJews have been amongst things practised with more than ordinary\r\nfrequency, if only such an extreme punishment availed to check it;\r\nand so we cannot really be surprised to find that the Holy Books of\r\nthat Nation perhaps earlier than the writings of any other People were\r\nacquainted only too well with diseases of the genital organs acquired\r\nby coition. The particular disease that broke out in consequence of the\r\nworship of Baal-Peor has been discussed above in §§ 8 and 9; while the\r\nfact that the Mosaic books contain the first traces of a knowledge of\r\n_Gonorrhoea_ has long been regarded as proved beyond a doubt[159].\r\n\r\nIf the Climate already exerted such an influence on the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants, how much greater must this have been where foreigners\r\nwere concerned, on whom all endemic excitants of disease in a country\r\nnotoriously work with augmented virulence. In Antiquity this fact must\r\nhave been even more conspicuously true, inasmuch as at that period the\r\nNations still remained much more unmixed than they subsequently became.\r\nIt is a thing which always hitherto, speaking generally, has been far\r\ntoo little taken account of by Pathologists, but which is surely of\r\nvast importance in connection with the rise and spread of Venereal\r\ndisease,—without its being in any way implied that we must necessarily\r\ntherefore adopt the theory of its American origin[160]. If we are not\r\nmuch mistaken, this factor was operative also in the case of the Plague\r\nof Baal-Peor. Now what holds good for the Jews, must equally hold good\r\nfor the other peoples of Asia and of Egypt, and even in an enhanced\r\ndegree, since these, as we have seen above, gave way to vicious\r\nindulgence to a yet more excessive degree.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, then as now distinctions no doubt existed, and probably\r\nin Antiquity as at the present day there were districts, whose\r\nphysical conditions of climate might be regarded as actually forming\r\na counteracting factor, and where in spite of excesses the genital\r\norgans seldom became diseased. The evidence for this must be given\r\nby later investigations, for we must of necessity first possess a\r\ngeographical Nosology of Venereal disease at the present day, if we\r\nare ever to succeed in finding and utilizing the materials for the\r\nsame in Antiquity. What has been so far collected by the meritorious\r\n_Schnurrer_ in his Geographical Nosology is too incomplete to justify\r\nus at present in drawing any certain conclusions, more particularly as\r\nthe greatest part of the material contributed by him is drawn from the\r\ncommunications of non-medical enquirers.\r\n\r\nThe climate of _Greece_ neither exercised any pre-eminently\r\nstimulating effect on the sexual activity of the genitals, nor yet did\r\nit afford a ground for the enhancement of their individual activity.\r\nThus enjoying as it did in consequence of that happy combination of\r\nits seasons justly celebrated by ancient Writers[161] the advantages,\r\nwithout the disadvantages, of the Tropics, and its inhabitants\r\npossessing all functions in a more vigorous proportion, the climate\r\ncould not possibly have been directly favourable to the rise of\r\naffections of the genitals; and for this reason made unnecessary all\r\nprecautionary measures aimed at them, such as were required in Asia.\r\n_Italy_ exhibits but little analogy with the Greek climate; still it\r\ncannot certainly without considerable qualification be reckoned among\r\nfactors favourable to maladies of the genital organs. From this we\r\nmay at any rate partly explain why the physicians of Greece and Rome\r\ngive so little satisfactory information on the diseases in question,\r\nthough indeed, as we shall see presently, in this case other and quite\r\ndistinct factors were at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 30.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen that Climate is _ipso facto_ an important factor\r\nfavourable to the rise of affections of the genital organs. How much\r\n_more_ powerful an influence must it exert on such affections when\r\nalready in existence. Thus the question, _what influence did Climate\r\nmanifest in Antiquity on the character and course of affections of the\r\ngenitals_, is one of the utmost moment in connection with a History of\r\nVenereal disease,—the more so as on a correct answer being given to\r\nit depends the correctness of our views as to the form taken in such\r\ncases by the morbid process in Ancient times. True such a question\r\npresupposes the existence of these affections, and ought therefore,\r\nstrictly speaking, only to be raised after the conclusion of our\r\npresent investigations. However we think enough evidence has already\r\nbeen adduced in the preceding pages to remove all possible doubt from\r\nthe mind of an attentive reader as to such being the case. Besides,\r\nthis appears to us the more convenient course,—to survey in its\r\nentirety the influence exerted by Climate, rather than to take up our\r\ninvestigation of the subject afresh in different places, and thus to a\r\ngreater or less extent mangle the discussion of it.\r\n\r\nPreponderance of the vegetative principle combined with a certain\r\nslackness of tissue is the character of all organisms coming under\r\nthe influence of the climate of Southern lands. In these countries an\r\nextra-ordinary stimulus acts on the mucous membrane of the genitals,\r\nand the character described will find its expression here also.\r\nReaction will proceed not so much from the arterial side, or show\r\nitself under the guise of sthenic inflammation, but rather take the\r\nform merely of intensified secretion. What this increased secretion\r\naims at is the removal of the abnormal stimulus, and the flow of\r\nmucus so originating manifests itself as simple, so to speak merely\r\ncatarrhal, blennorrhoea. This, where the atmosphere is not impregnated\r\nwith moist vapours, readily disappears, if only somewhat greater care\r\nis bestowed on the maintenance of cleanliness,—and all the more so, as\r\nre-absorption, which in hot climates acts vigorously on all the mucous\r\nmembranes generally, very soon gets the upper hand again in the case\r\nof that of the genital organs, seconded as it is by the activity of\r\nthe external skin. The latter is always in a condition of enhanced\r\naction at the same time, while the extent of its surface of course\r\nmarkedly exceeds that of the mucous membrane of the genitals. On the\r\nother hand where the atmosphere is especially moist, the activity of\r\nthe skin, as well as the process of re-absorption internally, appears\r\nto be less; and so under these circumstances the mucous flow will\r\nassume more of a chronic character, but at the same time to an even\r\ngreater degree be free from inflammatory reaction.\r\n\r\nAll the more recent observations agree in one thing, viz. that in\r\nSouthern countries the gonorrhoeal forms predominate, and speaking\r\ngenerally, almost always run a mild course that hardly calls for\r\nmedical interference. There is no doubt Climatic conditions in\r\nAntiquity differed but little from those of to-day; so that we may\r\nsafely assume that equally in Ancient times blennorrhoea showed the\r\nsame general characteristics, a fact which existing traditions moreover\r\nprove beyond question. The frequency of blennorrhoea of the genital\r\norgans in Antiquity is shown at once by the just quoted passage from\r\nthe Mosaic Books, while its mildness of character may be gathered\r\namongst other things from the remedies employed by the old Physicians,\r\nwho almost without exception followed the principle laid down by\r\n_Celsus_ (VI. 18.), to treat gonorrhoea _levibus medicamentis_ (with\r\ngentle remedial measures), if they were called upon to apply treatment\r\nat all. At least this is true of acute blennorrhoea; the chronic form\r\nof the complaint, with which alone as a general rule they had to do, of\r\ncourse required astringents. No doubt each failure of arterial reaction\r\nafforded yet another reason for the belief on the part of the Ancients\r\nthat gonorrhoea was a result of weakness of the seed-secreting vessels,\r\nand their idea that the discharge was merely badly prepared semen.\r\nSupposing, as must have happened, that marks of increased activity\r\nappeared, these proceeded not so much from the circulatory system\r\nat all as from the nerves, and _Galen_[162] was correct in referring\r\nPriapism under these conditions to spasmodic convulsion.\r\n\r\nSo much for mucous discharge. It was the same also with the various\r\nforms of ulceration of the genitals. The conditions to be enumerated\r\npresently in the next Section were already present to counteract their\r\nrise in any considerable proportion. Further, if they did appear in\r\nthe high lands of Asia and in Upper Egypt more frequently than did\r\nblennorhoea,—this much is shown plainly at any rate by present-day\r\nexperience,—still they lasted but a short time, as the preponderant\r\nactivity of vegetative growth, seconded by extraneous assistance, soon\r\nmastered the disease, and quickly restored again the loss of tissue.\r\nThe course of events was otherwise indeed on lower levels, as in Syria\r\nand Lower Egypt, districts which besides their high temperature also\r\nshowed a considerable degree of moisture in the atmosphere and soil.\r\nHere accordingly the different forms of ulceration, unless careful\r\nprecautions were taken, assumed a malignant character, and readily\r\npassed over into gangrene (ἄνθραξ), as we saw a little above happened\r\nin the cases of Apion and Hero. By this means it is true every specific\r\ncharacteristic of the morbid alteration was annihilated; _but_ this\r\nonly made the risk to the individual so much the greater, the patient\r\nbeing at best only too apt to lose the organ attacked\r\n\r\nAgain, though sometimes the part escaped destruction by gangrene,\r\neven then its cure was often difficult owing to the fact that, where\r\nthe malady had been neglected, worms made their appearance in the\r\nulcers[163], and set up so profuse and so far spreading a suppuration\r\nthat the patient eventually succumbed to it. Of this we have an example\r\nin the Emperor Galerius Maximianus, mentioned by _Eusebius_[164], and\r\nto which allusion is made as early as in the Book of Ecclesiasticus\r\n(XIX. 2, 3.), when the Author, Jesus the son of Sirach, says: “Wine and\r\nwomen will make men of understanding to fall away: and he that cleaveth\r\nto harlots will become impudent. _Moths_ (_otherwise[165]—Rottenness\r\nand worms_) shall have him to heritage, and a bold man shall be taken\r\naway.” The use of knife and actual cautery must naturally have played\r\nan important part under these circumstances in the treatment adopted;\r\nbut these the patient often dreaded more than the malady itself,\r\nand chose suicide rather than submit to them, like the “Municeps”\r\nwhose story Pliny tells in the passage quoted in a previous chapter.\r\nBut now supposing suchlike ulcers to be situated in the mouth of a\r\n_fellator_ or _cunnilingue_, then their course must have been all the\r\nmore rapid, and the danger involved all the greater, if the patient\r\nlived in such a climate as described; and it was in this way the\r\nΑἰγύπτια καὶ Συριακὰ and Βουβαστικὰ ἕλκεα (Egyptian and Syrian sores,\r\nBubastic sores) mentioned above acquired their evil repute. Still in\r\nthe majority of cases these climatic influences could be counteracted\r\nby appropriate medical aid and dietetic measures, or at any rate their\r\neffect considerably reduced. Hence it was that cases of the sort only\r\nvery rarely appeared in Antiquity, and for this very reason were noted\r\nby the Historians, when they did occur.\r\n\r\nThe human organism possessed in Southern lands yet another way of\r\ncombating the enemy’s attacks, one which would seem to have escaped the\r\nnotice of the Physicians of Antiquity, and which, though recognized\r\nin modern times, has yet never been at all adequately appreciated\r\nand utilized in the history of Venereal disease, viz. _the reaction\r\nexhibited by the skin in diseases of the genital organs in hot\r\nclimates_. So long as authorities thought of the external skin as\r\nmerely compacted of separate and distinct layers of tissue, there could\r\nnot really be any question of an accurate knowledge of its functions\r\nwhether under healthy or under morbid conditions. The investigations of\r\n_Breschet_ and _Roussel de Vauzène_[166] as confirmed and reinforced by\r\n_Gurlt_[167], have now taught us to understand that the skin, over and\r\nabove these layers, possesses as a matter of fact,—a fact formerly only\r\nconjectured,—special organs belonging to the same class as the glands,\r\nto wit the skin, hair and sweat glands. These share amongst them the\r\nfunction hitherto ascribed to the skin generally, and especially\r\nbring into correlation the sympathies of the different parts, so much\r\nso that they may be said to be almost the sole and only seat of the\r\nmanifold forms of skin-diseases. All this we endeavoured first to\r\ndemonstrate in the series of Articles on Skin-diseases in “_Blasius’_\r\nHandwörterbuch der Chirurgie und Augenheilkunde” (Manual of Surgery and\r\nOphthalmology), and so pave the way for a compendious Survey of our\r\nknowledge of the Skin-diseases up to the present time.\r\n\r\nNow while the sweat-glands stand in a special connection of sympathy\r\nand antagonism with the lungs, the same correlation exists in a\r\npeculiar degree between the glands of the mucous membrane of the\r\nintestinal canal and of the genital organs on the one hand and the\r\ncutaneous glands on the other which secrete the _sebum_ or sebaceous\r\nhumour. It would take us too far a-field, if we undertook in this\r\nplace to enter upon a detailed explanation of this circumstance, which\r\nhowever is still in sore need of further clearing up. We shall content\r\nourselves with recalling the fact that Onanists (Masturbators) not only\r\noften betray themselves by having a nose with a shiny, tallowy looking\r\nsurface that comes from excessive secretion of _sebum_, but also not\r\nless frequently by their face being covered with _acne_ pustulus.\r\nOne more fact we must mention is that the outbreak of _acne_ very\r\noften with girls heralds the approach of each period of menstruation,\r\nand accompanies it[168]. These are signs clearly pointing to the\r\nconclusion that stimulations of the genitals are reflected back on the\r\nglands of the skin, for _acne_ is nothing else but an affection of\r\nthese glands, as we have demonstrated in the Work just mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut indeed there are proofs of this antagonism still nearer to\r\nhand. How frequently have our physicians observed an eruption[169]\r\nresembling _roseola_ or _urticaria_ in character, at the—very often\r\nsudden—appearance of which the gonorrhoeal symptoms have much decreased\r\nin severity or disappeared altogether! These skin affections have been\r\nascribed to the balsam of Copaiva or the Cubebs pepper administered\r\nin these cases, which are supposed to have stimulated the intestinal\r\nmucous membrane and so sympathetically excited the skin. This may\r\nvery possibly sometimes be the case; but it could not but occur\r\nmuch more frequently, if the remedial agents mentioned are to bear\r\nthe sole and entire blame. No doubt in some patients a particular\r\nidiosyncrasy may have given rise to sympathetic action stimulative of\r\nthe intestinal canal, but in the majority the reaction of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the genitals on the cutaneous glands has undoubtedly been\r\na chief contributory factor under epidemic influences, while the drugs\r\nexhibited have played only a subordinate part in producing the result.\r\nThere are cases where the gonorrhœa has been treated simply and solely\r\nby mere antiphlogistic methods, and yet such an eruption has been\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nBut it is not in gonorrhœa only that these phænomena appear; they have\r\nbeen noted as well in chancre, being then ascribed to the sublimate\r\nof mercury and looked upon as affording a criterion that the drug had\r\nexercised its full effect on the original complaint. In most cases this\r\nwas without doubt a mistake, for Biett, Rayer and other authorities\r\nhave noted the most widely divergent forms of skin-disease to appear\r\nconcurrently with the existence of chancre, and in consequence have\r\ncome to regard them as primitive symptoms. In fact cases have actually\r\nbeen observed, where these were the sole primary symptoms of contagion\r\nafter indulgence in unclean coition. At the same time it is only fair\r\nto say that this has been doubted in many quarters, observers trying to\r\nexplain the fact of the absence of other symptoms by saying the ulcers,\r\nwhich are frequently very minute, may have been overlooked. At least\r\nexperience has sufficiently taught us this much, that the so-called\r\nsecondary symptoms, and therefore the skin-affections as well, appear\r\nthe more readily in proportion as the ulcers of the genitals are\r\nsmaller and more superficial; and we ourselves believe that never\r\nwithout local reaction on the genital organs from coition do so-called\r\nsecondary appearances arise,—only it is not invariably ulcers that are\r\nto looked for.\r\n\r\nNow when even in our temperate climate the cutaneous glands play a not\r\nunimportant part in the morbid processes of Venereal disease, how much\r\nmore must this be the case in Asia and Egypt, where the activity of\r\nthe skin generally and that of the cutaneous glands in particular is\r\neven under normal conditions far more conspicuously energetic, as may\r\nbe seen from the constant oily state of the skin, more particularly in\r\nNegroes. This oily grease on the skin is in fact nothing more nor less\r\nthan the product of the action of the cutaneous glands. These glands\r\nare peculiarly apt to become morbidly affected in travellers visiting\r\nthe South during their acclimatisation; though natives too are yearly\r\nattacked in the Summer months by complaints of the skin-glands.[170]\r\nThe fact has long been recognized[171] that in Southern countries not\r\nonly the greater number of skin-diseases, but even Venereal disease\r\nitself in an especial degree, appear as an exanthema of the skin,\r\nand for this reason it there displays far less destructive effects;\r\nbut as a rule enquirers have contented themselves with the general\r\nhabit, without (as pointed out before) adequately turning the fact to\r\nadvantage in connection with the History and Theory of Venereal disease.\r\n\r\nThis preponderating bias towards the external skin must obviously\r\nmanifest itself equally in other diseases of the mucous membranes, and\r\nso too in those of the genital organs. Reabsorption in particular,\r\nacting with increased vigour on the mucous surfaces, will prove its\r\nbeneficial presence also in the diseases affecting them. The foreign\r\nmatter that comes in contact with these surfaces is assimilated to a\r\nless degree by the mucous glands and by those of the _glans penis_, and\r\nno time is allowed it to exert a destructive influence on the small\r\nsurface receiving it; on the other hand it is quickly thrown back\r\non the much more extensive surface of the external skin, and there\r\ndealt with by the cutaneous glands with their powerful secretive and\r\nassimilatory action, being either assimilated or expelled externally.\r\n\r\nIn particular localities this quickly happens without any striking\r\nsymptoms being locally perceptible in the skin, as e. g. in Numidia,\r\nLibya[172] and the Northern part of Peru[173], where the disease is\r\nsaid to cure itself without extraneous medical aid, and among the\r\ninhabitants generally to be practically non-existent (?). Though\r\nthis is not the case in other countries, still the cutaneous glands\r\nbecome involved in the morbid process of the disease, and secrete\r\nwith augmented copiousness, and the secretion being simultaneously\r\naltered in character, it fails to be driven out externally, inasmuch\r\nas external elimination is at once stopped owing to the fact that the\r\ncutaneous glands, like the uterus in pregnancy, close their orifice,\r\nso as to be enabled to carry out their function in their recesses.\r\nFor this reason the glands swell, and manifest themselves in the\r\nform of _papillae_ or tubercles (very often as little bladders, or\r\nblebs), changing later either into pustules, if the morbid products\r\nare eventually expelled[174], or else gradually disappear, if the\r\nprocess of assimilation and re-absorption has been sufficiently\r\nvigorous. Supposing damp, cold or other unfavourable influences to be\r\nat work, suppuration may very well supervene, or degenerative processes\r\ncommence, and so on, and _the disease pass over into leprosy and\r\nelephantiasis_. This is above all the case in Egypt, where from the\r\nfirst, chancres on the genitals would seem to possess a marked tendency\r\ntowards scurfy and scabby formations[175].\r\n\r\nIf these are the facts at the present day,—and no one doubts they\r\nare,—there only remains the question: were they so in Ancient times\r\nas well? Here we come face to face with the difficult problem as to\r\nthe relation of leprosy with Venereal disease,—a problem which for\r\nCenturies has been the subject of dispute, and in spite of the very\r\ncareful enquiries of a Hensler and of other investigators, cannot\r\nby any means be regarded as solved. Our own investigations on the\r\nLeprosy of the Ancients are as yet too incomplete, and the nature of\r\nthe subject demands such far-reaching inquisition into the most widely\r\ndifferent individual phænomena, that we are compelled, in order to\r\neconomise our space, to renounce all idea of submitting the subject\r\nto any more detailed examination in the present Work. Besides, in our\r\nSecond Part we shall be coming back to it again, when we have under\r\ninvestigation the question as to whether or no the Venereal disease of\r\nthe XVth Century was developed from leprosy.\r\n\r\nFor our present purpose the following statement must suffice:\r\nThe Climate of Asia and Egypt was in Antiquity, as mentioned\r\nalready, undoubtedly but little different from what it is to-day,\r\nand the influence it exerted therefore must have shared in this\r\nresemblance[176].\r\n\r\nAs to _mentagra_, we have already proved a little above that it was\r\na consequence of the vice of the _cunnilingue_, and as according to\r\nPliny’s report the latter claimed Egypt for its fatherland, obviously\r\nthe climate of that country must have been in part responsible for\r\nits origination. Now affections of the genital organs being found in\r\nAntiquity as the result of sexual intercourse, it follows that in this\r\ndirection also Climate must have exerted its influence, and that in\r\nthe very same way as we have just above seen it do,—in other words\r\nmanifold affections of the skin must have originated in consequence of\r\nirritation and other morbid effects on the genital organs. True the\r\nAncient physicians say not a word of this; but then they derive the\r\ngreater proportion of the skin-diseases, which they mass all together\r\nin the most admired confusion, from internal mischief of various sorts,\r\nand regard them all as _apostases_ (suppurative inflammations carrying\r\noff the effect of fevers, etc.),—at any rate a proof they were not\r\nentirely unacquainted with the antagonistic relations existing between\r\nthe skin and other organs.\r\n\r\nSo far as the genitals are concerned, they seem to have adequately\r\nrealized only the _consensus_ between the uterus and the skin[177],\r\nwhereas in male subjects they appear to have put down most of the\r\neffects observed to the liver. But on these points we shall have\r\nsomething further to say later on. Still the assertion to the effect\r\nthat Eunuchs are not attacked by _calvities_ (baldness) (_Hippocrates_,\r\nI. 400; _Galen_, XVIII. A. 40., also p. 42., where mention is made\r\nof the excesses _in Baccho et Venere_—in Wine and Love—peculiarly\r\nprevalent at his epoch), which was a frequent consequence of vice in\r\nAntiquity[178], points to the _consensus_ between genitals and skin\r\nhaving been already noted. Even more is the fact, vouched for by\r\n_Archigenes_[179], that castration was recommended by some Physicians\r\nas a cure for elephantiasis, such as to arouse the suspicion that the\r\nphysicians of Antiquity knew perfectly well what influence affections\r\nof the genital organs exerted on diseases of the skin. This is made\r\nall the more likely by Archigenes (ch. 120.) not only speaking of the\r\ndisease as being contagious, but also describing the skin-affection as\r\nsecondary in character. He further declares its cause to be unknown,\r\nputs on record the extreme lubricity of the patients (Satyriasis pp.\r\n74, 133, 269.), and even says in so many words that such as were\r\ncastrated did not contract elephantiasis!\r\n\r\nWe have seen how _mentagra_ attacked the _cunnilingue_, and afterwards\r\npassed over into _psora_; in just the same way might elephantiasis,—a\r\ncomplaint indeed which the Gloss of the Pseudo-Galen actually puts in\r\nconnection with the Morbus Phoeniceus (Phoenician Disease),—be brought\r\non by indulgence in coition. This is in no way contradicted by the\r\npreference the disease exhibits for first making its appearance in the\r\nface, inasmuch as the cutaneous glands of the face are in a relation\r\nof special sympathy with the genital organs. That leprosy too no less\r\nthan elephantiasis was communicated and contracted by coition is shown\r\nby a host of examples given in the Mediæval Historians[180]; in fact,\r\na large number of Physicians held Venereal disease to be a species of\r\nleprosy or elephantiasis, while some made it actually originate in\r\nthe act of coition with leprous persons; yet for all that we do not,\r\naccording to _Hensler_, (“Vom Aussatz”,—On Leprosy, p. 396.), find it\r\nanywhere recorded that the genital organs were first affected,—apart\r\nthat is from what _Astruc_ has brought forward on purpose to support\r\nhis own view. As everybody knows, _he_ refers all local evils existing\r\nprior to the end of the XVth Century to Leprosy.\r\n\r\nBut what would follow supposing traces _were_ actually to be found\r\nproving that what was known in Asia as leprosy did as a matter of fact\r\nfirst show itself in the genitals? Before we enter upon the closer\r\nexamination of reasons for this supposition, we must quote a passage\r\nfrom the Work of _Von Roeser_ already several times mentioned, a\r\npassage equally important for the pathology of Venereal disease as for\r\nits History. _Von Roeser_, (p. 68.) writes thus: “Primary syphilis\r\nmanifests itself _in Egypt in the very rarest cases on the prepuce\r\nor glans of the verge_; the chancres are more commonly found on the\r\nouter skin of the penis nearer the _mons Veneris_, or actually on\r\nthis in the hairy parts which among Egyptians and Arabs are generally\r\nkept shaved, _or else on the scrotum_. _Pruner_[181] told me that the\r\noccurrence of a chancre on the prepuce, which indeed is absent in\r\nMohammedans owing to circumcision, or on the _glans penis_ is in the\r\nratio of 1: 3 to chancres on the last mentioned parts, hence in that\r\ncountry Astruc’s opinion that syphilitic ulcers hardly ever formed on\r\nthe exterior of the verge, is strongly contradicted,—as is no less true\r\namongst ourselves. That circumcision is not the sole cause of this\r\nphænomenon is manifest from the fact that in Smyrna and Constantinople\r\nI saw plenty of chancres on the _glans_, as well as amongst Jews at\r\nhome, though I am not going to deny that circumcision may have some\r\nshare in causing the rarity of the appearance of a chancre on the\r\n_glans_,—but this does not in any way explain the frequency of their\r\nappearance on the scrotum and the _mons Veneris_. A tendency to take\r\nthe exanthematic type, a tendency which makes itself known also by the\r\nfact of _many chancres_ commonly appearing at once and _showing in a\r\nmarked degree a preference for scurfy and scabby forms_, might very\r\npossibly afford a better explanation of the phænomenon in question.”\r\n\r\nNow as to the supposition just expressed, this is based on a repeated\r\nexamination of a passage of the very utmost importance in the history\r\nof leprosy, viz. Ch. XIII. of Leviticus—a chapter which has exercised\r\nTheologians no less than Physicians for Centuries, but without our\r\nbeing enabled to regard the investigations it has given rise to as in\r\nany way concluded. However it is no intention of ours to provide in\r\nthis place a commentary on this Chapter, more particularly as we do\r\nnot possess the philological acquirements necessary for a critical\r\nappreciation of the results so far obtained. Neither, speaking in\r\ngeneral terms, has anything like sufficient progress in the study of\r\noriginal sources for the history of leprosy as yet been made to enable\r\nan adequate judgement to be formed; we much prefer to limit our efforts\r\nat present to contributing sundry observations, which stand in close\r\nconnection with our immediate object, and at the same time may afford\r\nreaders, whether scientific or philological authorities, an opportunity\r\nof favouring us with their judgement as specialists.\r\n\r\nThe correct understanding of the whole passage appears to us to\r\ndepend in the first place on the success of the endeavour to find a\r\ncertain and definite explanation of the expression בְּעוֹר בְּשָׂרוֹ\r\n(b’ôr b’sarô,—“skin of the flesh” in English Authorized Version).\r\nLuther rendered this by: _on the skin of his flesh_; the Septuagint\r\ntranslators give it as ἐν δέρματι χρωτὸς αὐτοῦ (in the skin of the\r\nsurface); while _de Wette_ (whose Translation of the passage generally\r\nwe hereby ask the reader to consult, space not allowing us to quote the\r\nwhole Chapter) translates it _on the skin of his body_, and understands\r\nby the expression every part of the external skin.\r\n\r\nSupposing this translation the correct one, it will be a hard matter to\r\nexplain how it was the hair should simultaneously have turned _white_,\r\na circumstance which strangely enough caused even Hensler no surprise.\r\nRosenmüller in his Scholia on the passage says: _Schilling_ (_De lepra\r\np. 7._) observat, in lepra alba pilos albescere_, (_Schilling_, On\r\nLeprosy p. 7. notes that in white leprosy the hair grows white); but\r\nit is only the _partes pilosae aut capillatae_ (hairy parts, parts\r\ncovered with long hair) that are here intended, and these are to be\r\nunderstood as including merely the head, eye-brows, chin, armpits and\r\npubic region. Obviously the hair on other parts of the body cannot be\r\ntaken here into consideration, as it is specifically almost colourless,\r\nand though it is true it may have had a stronger coloration in many\r\nJews, surely they did not _all_ belong to the race of Esau. Again\r\nall writers on leprosy, when this mischief affecting the hair is in\r\nquestion, speak solely of the hair of the parts named[182]. So when\r\n_Haly Abbas_ in a passage quoted by Hensler (_Excerpta_ p. 9.), in\r\nwhich he is treating of _Allopitia_ and _Tyria_ (forms of leprosy),\r\nsays, _Nonnunquam totius accidit pilis corporis_ (Sometimes this\r\nhappens to all the hair of the body), this also is to be understood\r\nmerely of the parts above named. Indeed _Hensler_ himself (Vom\r\nAussatz,—On Leprosy, p. 304.) assumes this when, after speaking of the\r\nhair of the head and beard, he goes on: “But this mischief may also\r\nattack other hairy parts of the body. _Haly Abbas_ says, (_Excerpta_\r\np. 9.) At times this affects also the hair of the whole body. True the\r\npassage of _Hippocrates_, in view of the erroneous punctuation, seems\r\nto belong more properly to what follows, still even by itself it would\r\nbe probable enough, as _the preliminary symptoms are found particularly\r\nin the arm-pit and the groin_, and might of course extend their ravages\r\nthere, just as much as on the head.” However should anyone wish to\r\nunderstand here _all_ the hairy parts of the body mentioned, and\r\nsuppose the Author to be speaking in the first instance in a general\r\nsense, then what follows will not agree, for the hair of the head and\r\nbeard was _not_ changed into _white_, but into _yellow_ (צָהֹב), as V.\r\n30 states. There are left therefore only the eye-brows, arm-pits and\r\nthe pubic region, to which the transformation to white can apply.\r\n\r\nGranting these considerations to be correct, it is impossible to\r\nunderstand the _b’ôr b’sarô_ as signifying the whole exterior surface\r\nof the skin; it must imply a local limitation. But the limited area\r\nintended can be nothing but _the genitals_, and this agrees best at\r\nonce with the facts and with the usages of Biblical phraseology. In\r\nmore than one passage, in fact, of the Old Testament _basar_, like σάρξ\r\n(flesh) in the New, has the meaning of “sexual parts”; and even in\r\nEnglish the word _flesh_, particularly in ecclesiastical language, is\r\nconsecrated by custom in this sense. So Luther was perfectly justified\r\nin the passage under discussion in translating as he did: _on the\r\nskin of his flesh_, that is to say, of his genitals. The particular\r\ncombination of _b’ôr b’sarô_ we have not it is true been able to find\r\nused generally in the books of the Old Testament, but we must not\r\ntherefore conclude absolutely that it is unique and peculiar to this\r\nXIIIth. Chapter; though indeed, if such _were_ the case, it would\r\nmerely be an additional confirmation of the explanation we have given.\r\n\r\nSo far as the matter of fact goes, such an assumption offers no\r\ndifficulties,—indeed it actually removes several, as e. g. that\r\nconnected with the coloration of the skin, and not only proves that\r\nalready at that date pustules on the genitals had been observed that\r\nwere free from any suspicion of malignant character, but further that\r\nalong with a suspicious pustule or similar symptom (scurf, ulcer) there\r\nwent a simultaneous general affection of the skin as a whole, which was\r\nheld to be diagnostic for the local malady, and accordingly proclaimed\r\neven the suspected leper free from taint after his recovery from it.\r\nFor evidently we must take verses 12 and 13 as indicating this, where\r\nit is stated in so many words: “And if the leprosy break out (פָּרַח,\r\n—blossom) abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of\r\nhim that hath the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as\r\nappeareth to the priest; then the priest shall look: and behold, if\r\nthe leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean\r\nthat hath the plague; it is all turned white: he is clean.” (English\r\nRevised Version). The last words have been wrongly referred by some\r\nInterpreters to the “Bohak” (bright spot), which is mentioned in verse\r\n39., but really nothing more than this is intended:—after the eruption\r\nis dried up, and the skin has returned to its natural white colour,\r\nthen the hitherto sick man is to be declared clean[183].\r\n\r\nThis diagnostic eruption again points to another fact, viz. that the\r\nleprosy must have had its seat in a part of the body, the cutaneous\r\nglands of which stand in a relation of lively sympathy with those of\r\nthe skin generally, and this according to modern experience can only\r\nbe the cutaneous glands of the genital organs. Sometimes inoculation\r\nwith cow-pox lymph brings out a general eruption of the whole skin,\r\nbut this circumstance cannot well be made pertinent here, as really\r\nand truly the lymph is a resultant product of a feverish affection,\r\nand therefore its innate tendency is towards a reproduction of itself\r\nunder circumstances of feverish stimulation, and to set the whole\r\norganism, and consequently the whole cutaneous glandular system, in a\r\nstate of enhanced activity. How the diagnostic eruption comes about\r\nmay be gathered from the statement of the case given just above; while\r\nthe passage quoted from _von Roeser’s_ Work will explain the rest.\r\nStill for the present this much may suffice to put the expert reader\r\nin a position to test our conjecture,—for indeed so far it makes no\r\nprofession to be more than a conjecture. Supposing it found tenable,\r\nthen the further consequences that cannot but grow from it for the\r\nelucidation of the Chapter in discussion may be readily developed. On\r\nthe other hand, if it is devoid of justification, it would be quite\r\nuseless further to elaborate a hypothesis, plunging a subject obscure\r\nenough without this in even deeper darkness. Further than this we\r\nonly need to mention that _Hensler_ and others hold _mentagra_ to be\r\nindicated in the bald chin and scurfy (scall) chin of Leviticus (XIII.\r\n29 sqq.), which if they are right would merely be another point in\r\nfavour of our view.\r\n\r\nFinally there can hardly be any need for us to observe that we have no\r\nidea of holding leprosy in general to be a consequence of excesses;\r\non the contrary we believe, to return to the problem we started with\r\nat the beginning of this Section, that we are bound to agree to the\r\nopinion first explicitly laid down by _Becket_[184], viz. _that under\r\nthe widely comprehensive notion of Leprosy were included other forms\r\nof skin-diseases owing their existence to some previous affection of\r\nthe genital organs_,—in precisely the same way as this happened in the\r\nMiddle Ages, and as may be the case occasionally even at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 31.\r\n\r\nWhat precise influence Climate exerted on the form taken and course run\r\nby affections of the genital organs _in Greece and Italy_, can be only\r\napproximately laid down, as the information supplied by Physicians,\r\nthough ample in quantity, mostly leaves the point indefinite as to\r\nwhere the observations were made, whether in Asia Minor and Egypt\r\n(Alexandria), or in Greece and Italy. The last named country indeed\r\nwas, as is well known, almost entirely devoid of independent native\r\nmedical Writers.\r\n\r\nThe mild, genial sky of Greece and Italy impressed on all forms of\r\ndisease, including diseases of the genitals, a mild character. There,\r\non the confines of East and West, we find, it is true, the same natural\r\ntendencies prevailing as in Asia, but always on a less exaggerated\r\nscale. _Von Roeser_ (loco citato p. 70.) says: “In conclusion we\r\nshould note further that in Egypt gonorrhœa is a complaint of very\r\nrare occurrence, in Greece and Turkey a very common one. That the\r\nexanthematic character taken by syphilis is not(?) responsible for the\r\nfact of its not manifesting itself as gonorrhœa is confirmed by the\r\ncircumstance that it occurs much more frequently in Greece than amongst\r\nourselves, whereas syphilis in that country has (though not in an\r\nidentical form) the exanthematic type to an even greater degree than in\r\nour own.” _D. Hennen_[185] found Venereal disease rare in Cephalonia,\r\nbut on the contrary gonorrhœa quite common.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the tendency to determine towards the skin is clearly\r\nnoticeable in Greece as well, but not to such an extent as to outweigh\r\nthe local affection. The latter accordingly takes a more independent\r\nform than is the case in Asia, and for this reason, though making its\r\nappearance more frequently, neither follows so rapid a course nor\r\nshows so destructive a character,—if only the organism is seconded to\r\nsome extent in the efforts to combat the malady. This is shown by the\r\nstatements _Galen_ has left as to gonorrhœa and ulcers occurring in\r\nconnection with bubonic swellings,—a matter we shall have occasion to\r\nspeak of later. While in Asia the skin affection is manifested by the\r\nformation of pustules and scurf, in Greece and neighbouring countries\r\nof the South it rather takes the shape of _papillae_ and small blisters\r\nor blebs, and only in obstinate cases breaks out in tubercles. Hence\r\n_lepra_, _psora_, _lichen_, and _elephantiasis_ are the forms under\r\nwhich we must look for it in the medical Writers of Antiquity, who\r\nhowever say nothing as to the origin of these diseases, or else,\r\nas we have seen before, refer them all to deficiency of the moist\r\nhumours[186].\r\n\r\nWe have never yet succeeded, though we have before now expended much\r\ntime on the effort, in getting a clear grasp of the ideas the Ancient\r\nphysicians intended to express by the different designations they gave\r\nto the various skin-diseases. So we are constrained to postpone deeper\r\ninvestigation of the question to a subsequent occasion, or wait to see\r\nwhether meantime some other enquirer, better equipped for the work,\r\nmay not throw light on the chaos. Only so far as _Scabies_ (Scab) is\r\nconcerned, it would seem allowable to assume allusions to be intended\r\nto vicious living as a cause of the malady. It cannot be without a\r\nreason that for centuries this one above all other skin diseases seems\r\nto have fallen under special disrepute; and the term to have been used\r\nby poets, by _Martial_[187] for example, to indicate that sensual\r\nindulgence had been at work. In fact, several of the earliest Writers\r\non Venereal disease hold it to be a sort of _scabies_, and even at a\r\nlater period there is for long frequent mention made of _Venereal scars\r\nor scabs_. Possibly also in Greece lepra (leprosy) was looked upon as a\r\nform of skin-disease that was come by in no reputable way, and commonly\r\nregarded as an inheritance of the debauchees[188], just as we saw to be\r\nthe case with _mentagra_ at Rome.\r\n\r\nAffections of the external skin consequent upon complaints of the\r\ngenital organs being thus no less common in Ancient times than they are\r\nto-day, it follows that in inverse proportion forms of ulceration of\r\nthe palate and nose, as well as complaints affecting the bones, must\r\nhave fallen into the background and have been of more rare occurrence,\r\njust as is observed to be the case in the present day[189]. So, to\r\ncombine all the varying forms under one generalisation, we may say that\r\nthis represents a type of disease of an exceedingly mild and favourable\r\ncharacter, particularly if attention is directed only to the external\r\nsymptoms, as indeed was habitually done by the old pathologists.\r\nFor even the skin-affection itself presents so little that is\r\ncharacteristic, or at any rate shows itself under such varying shapes,\r\nthat even at the present day its diagnosis is extremely difficult,\r\nbeing very often based solely and entirely on the admission of the\r\npatient, whether voluntary or forced from him, of having suffered from\r\ngonorrhœa or chancre. But if the so-called secondary symptoms are\r\nmore or less completely absent, or lack distinctness, what is there\r\nthen left beyond the primary affections of the genitals and their\r\nsuccedanea? Full and sufficient descriptions of these are not lacking;\r\nwe have already quoted numerous examples, and we shall find others yet\r\nclearer and more precise later on.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the subject of the influence exerted by Climate, we\r\nare bound to return once more to the question, _in what relation\r\ndid contagion_, if contagion there was, _stand to this climatic\r\ninfluence?_ The existence of contagion in the case of gonorrhœa is\r\ncertified by the passage of _Galen_ already quoted by Naumann, which\r\nwe propose later on to give in full, besides being implied long before\r\nby the law of purification of the Mosaic Books. So far as ulcerous\r\nformations, condylomata and skin-affections such as _mentagra_ etc.,\r\nare concerned, proof is supplied by the facts we have previously given.\r\nAccording to more modern experience all forms of contagion exhibit in\r\nSouthern countries a more fugitive type than elsewhere and spread with\r\nproportionately greater readiness. Whereas in such as are naturally\r\nfugitive, the intensity may for that very reason be less injurious,\r\nfixed and stable forms of contagion on the contrary must obviously\r\nlose in strength, at any rate so far as their local effects go. They\r\nwill be the less able to make good a lodgement in the organism,\r\nfrom the fact that, stimulating the latter as they do to a general\r\nactivity, they are the more readily resisted and prevented by this very\r\nstate of enhanced activity. For just as, speaking generally, chronic\r\ncomplaints, uncomplicated by fever, can only be removed by artificially\r\nsetting up a feverish condition, that is to say by calling on the\r\norganism as a whole to share in the local manifestations of disease.\r\nPrecisely the same is true of local affections set up by any fixed\r\nand stable contagion, and so the removal of the actual contagion can\r\nonly be successfully brought about either by direct decomposition and\r\ndestruction of the affected tissue or by metamorphosis into a fugitive\r\nform.\r\n\r\nNow inasmuch as the contagion was rapidly thrown off from the point of\r\nfirst infection upon the cutaneous glands,—and this happened the more\r\nreadily, the more fugitive its character was,—the affections there set\r\nup by it standing in such clear relation as they did with the primary\r\nsymptoms, were necessarily bound also to exhibit a greater or less\r\ndegree of the contagious character, as indeed is observed according\r\nto _Jos. Frank_, _Biett_ and other authorities even in Europe to the\r\npresent day. In Greece, where the transformation was less often to\r\npustular and scurfy forms, more frequently merely to papillae or at\r\nworst little bladder-like risings, or blebs (Phlyctaenae), while at the\r\nsame time the energy of the skin was not so pronounced, the interval\r\nbetween the appearance of the primary and secondary symptoms was\r\ngreater, and the contagiousness of the skin-affections undoubtedly less\r\nprominent, it cost the organism in that climate much more strenuous\r\neffort to set in action the elimination of the disease by the skin.\r\nConsequently the nervous system as well was injuriously affected by\r\nsympathy to a greater extent, while the exanthematic forms showed\r\nthemselves in more obvious conjunction with itch (_psora!_). This was\r\npartially the case in Italy too, though here the climate approximated\r\nmore nearly to that of Lower Egypt, leading to a more frequent\r\nappearance of pustulous forms, as shown by the prevalence in that\r\ncountry of _mentagra_.\r\n\r\nBut just as climatic influence relaxed the intensity of contagion, and\r\ndiminished concurrently the malignancy of disease-types, local as well\r\nas general, so on the contrary, in those cases where other influences\r\ntended to counteract its effect, while the organism was not strong\r\nenough to overmaster the assaults of the enemy by general or local\r\nactivity, it sought to guard against the contagion rising to a higher\r\ndegree of independence; it set up mortification of the ulcers, by which\r\nmeans the contagion itself was directly destroyed. From all this it\r\nmay be concluded, that although climate must evidently be acknowledged\r\nto be an important factor favourable to the rise of affections of the\r\ngenital organs in Antiquity as much as at the present day, yet on the\r\nother hand it tended by its own action to combat the mischief it had\r\noriginated; and so, at any rate so far as the development of the morbid\r\nprocess is concerned, is to be regarded to an almost equal degree as a\r\ncounteracting influence at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 32.\r\n\r\nThe experience of all ages has conclusively proved that a large\r\nproportion of such morbid phæenomena as occur in consequence of local\r\nclimatic conditions are capable equally of being produced sooner or\r\nlater in countries and neighbourhoods the climate of which is entirely\r\ndifferent by help of the _genius epidemicus_; and that the readiness\r\nwith which they are so produced varies in direct ratio with the degree\r\nin which the climate is associated with and seconds the favourable\r\nfactors. It is indeed extremely difficult, in view of the low level\r\nof development to which the science of Epidemics, in general no less\r\nthan in particular, has as yet attained, to show this as applicable in\r\nany given case, more especially if it is a question of the epidemic\r\ncondition of some disease of which the pathological relations\r\nthemselves are far from being as yet adequately known. Still this must\r\nnot prevent us from making at any rate an attempt at investigation of\r\nthe question, how much or how little effort has been manifested by such\r\ninfluence in the course of years.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of the genius epidemicus on diseases in general\r\nis a twofold one. _Either_ it supplies the capital, most essential\r\nexternal circumstances conditioning the production of a disease,\r\nin fact is related to it as cause to effect. In virtue of it the\r\ndisease is an _epidemic_ disease, coming into existence for the first\r\ntime concurrently with the development of the genius epidemicus,\r\ndisappearing again with the cessation of its prevalence, and once\r\nagain springing up if and when the genius epidemicus makes a second\r\nre-appearance. _Or else_ the most essential external conditioning\r\ncircumstances are specifically independent of the genius epidemicus;\r\nwhile the latter takes merely a remote share in the way of favouring or\r\ncounteracting the production of the disease, manifesting its influence\r\nrather in modifying the form and direction of such morbid reactions as\r\nhave arisen in the organism without its intervention at all,—in other\r\nwords _the disease is subject to epidemic influence_.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately hitherto these two kinds of influence exerted by the\r\ngenius epidemicus have been only too often confounded, and no adequate\r\ndistinction drawn between epidemic diseases on the one hand and\r\ndiseases subject to epidemic influence on the other. This has been\r\nespecially so with regard to Venereal disease, the epidemic character\r\nof which curiously enough enquirers have felt bound to vindicate, as\r\nwell at the beginning of the XVth. Century as here and there even at\r\nthe present day. The baselessness of such an opinion is so perfectly\r\nobvious to anyone who weighs the matter with any care, that we really\r\ndo not think it necessary to devote more pains now to proving the\r\npoint, particularly as we propose to treat it more fully in another\r\nplace. On the other hand Venereal disease _is_ subject to epidemic\r\ninfluence, in fact it is so perhaps to a greater extent than many\r\nother forms of sickness, as will be clearly shown in the course of\r\nour historical investigations. Accordingly the only question still\r\nwanting an answer is, how far such influence may have been effectual\r\nin Antiquity. This question of course presupposes the existence\r\nalready of a number of diseases appearing in consequence of Venereal\r\nexcesses; still we possess sufficient proof, as previously stated\r\nin the course of our enquiries into the influence of climate, to\r\njustify a provisional assumption of their existence for our immediate\r\npurpose. For openly admitting as we do our ignorance in relation to the\r\ninfluence of the genius epidemicus on sexual activity generally and on\r\nthe individual activity of the genital organs in particular, and noting\r\nthe problem to be one that can only be solved in the future, there is\r\nnothing else left us to investigate here but this, viz. _the influence\r\nof the genius epidemicus in reference to the forms taken and course\r\nfollowed by diseases occurring in consequence of Venereal excesses_.\r\n\r\nIt may be collected from later experience and observation that there\r\nare three clearly marked forms of the genius epidemicus or _epidemic\r\ncondition_, that exercise a preponderating influence on affections\r\nof the genitals and Venereal disease, and condition the frequency of\r\nthe occurrence of one or the other type of these, viz. _catarrhal_,\r\nconditioning blennorrhœal affections, the _exanthematic_, conditioning\r\ncomplaints of the cutaneous glands, and the _typhoïdal_, conditioning\r\nvarious forms of chancre and their malignancy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the influence of the _genius epidemicus catarrhalis_\r\nand _exanthematicus_, it would seem to be difficult to arrive at\r\nany definite conclusion as to what precisely this was in Asia and\r\nthe South of Europe, since the Climate was _ipso facto_, as already\r\nshown, pre-eminently favourable to blennorrhœal and cutaneous\r\naffections; nevertheless the rise and spread of mentagra as well as\r\nof elephantiasis in the time of Pompey the Great does afford some\r\nindication at any rate so far as Italy is concerned. No doubt the\r\nHippocratic writers several times mention the prevalence of skin\r\naffections at particular periods; but the expressions they employ are\r\ntoo general to make it possible for us to take these into special\r\nconsideration in this place. However there is one passage we must\r\nmake an exception of,—a passage of the greatest importance for our\r\npurpose, even though in all probability it refers to the commencement\r\nof a combined erysipelas-typhoïdal condition, to which we shall have\r\noccasion to return again later. In it Hippocrates relates how after\r\na dry Summer with Southerly winds and frequent rain there followed\r\na mild, wet Winter, next cold and even snow-storms succeeded in the\r\nSpring with much rain, and finally a very hot Summer again. In the\r\nSpring began inflammatory fevers and erysipelas, and[190] “in many\r\ncases aphthae and ulcerations formed in the mouth, many rheums occurred\r\nin the genitals taking the form of ulcers and abscesses on the external\r\nand internal surface of the sexual parts; also eye troubles, with\r\ndischarge, obstinate, persistent and painful; also growths, which are\r\ncalled σῦκα (figs) on the inner and outer surface of the eye-lids,\r\ncausing many to lose their sight; besides they frequently occurred\r\non other parts liable to ulceration and particularly on the genital\r\norgans.” In this passage the expressions ἑλκώματα, φύματα, ἔξωθεν\r\nἔσωθεν τὰ περὶ βουβῶνας (ulcers and abscesses on the external and\r\ninternal surface of the sexual parts) is as a rule misunderstood by\r\nthe annotators. But really ἔξωθεν (on the outside) evidently refers\r\nto ἑλκώματα (ulcers), while ἔσωθεν (on the inside) goes with φύματα\r\n(abscesses), and signifies a swelling and inflammation of a mucous\r\ngland resulting in suppuration, as may be seen from the next quoted\r\nAphorism[191]. “Such patients as have φύματα (abscesses) in the urethra\r\nfind relief, so soon as these have suppurated and broken.” That this\r\nrelief (λύσις) consisted in the cessation of pain and of the retention\r\nof urine may be gathered not only from Galen’s commentary on the first\r\npassage, and from the λύεται ὁ πόνος (the suffering is relieved) in\r\nthe repetition of the same Aphorism, but Hippocrates actually says so\r\ndistinctly in a third passage[192].\r\n\r\nSupposing the view, still generally held even in the last Century,\r\nthat regards gonorrhœa as a result of an ulcer in the urethra, to\r\nhave been already adopted in Hippocrates’ time,—and inasmuch as the\r\nexpression γονοῤῥοία, so far as we know, never occurs in his writings,\r\nthe assumption would not only not be absurd, but such a view would\r\nreally be preferable to that which makes out the discharge to be badly\r\nmade semen,—we shall find in this passage an expression of the fact of\r\nthe more common occurrence of gonorrhœa, the most troublesome symptom\r\nof which, viz. the pain suffered during micturition (πόνος, δυσουρία,\r\nἰσχουρία, suffering, difficulty in micturition, retention of urine),\r\ndisappears, as is well known, concurrently with the commencement of\r\nthe discharge (πύου ῥαγέντος, φυμάτων ῥαγέντων,—when the pus has\r\nbroken out, when the abscess has broken), or if it does not entirely\r\ndisappear, is at any rate sensibly diminished. But it is not really\r\nneedful to accept this as having been the ruling opinion; the facts may\r\nvery well be accounted for by supposing that in virtue of the _epidemic\r\ncondition_ a strongly marked tendency was set up on the part of the\r\nglandular organs to inflammatory and suppurative action, by which not\r\nmerely the glands of the external skin (ἑλκώματα ἔξωθεν),—ulcerations\r\non the outside, Moses’‏‎ יְהֹוָה צְבָאוֹת), but also those of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the urethra (φύματα ἔσωθεν,—abscesses on the inside) were\r\naffected, exactly as is observed at the present day, especially in the\r\nchronic forms of gonorrhœa.\r\n\r\nThe gonorrhœa then in this case would seem to have been of a more\r\nmalignant type and to have been combined with ulceration. This best\r\nagrees with the general delineation of the _epidemic condition_ as\r\na whole, the exanthematic character of which declared itself in\r\nthe fig-like growths or tumours,—the σῦκα αἰδοίοισιν (figs on the\r\ngenitals). _Grimm_ (Vol. I. p. 490.) already remarks on this passage\r\nof Hippocrates: “One might be tempted in this case to regard the\r\nulcerations of the genital parts and their consequences, the fig-like\r\ntumours, as being the first signs of disease due to incontinence.\r\nIndeed what was there to hinder an evil of the sort in those times\r\nand under a warm climate from signalizing itself,—then subsequently\r\nso far losing its malignant character that its nature was completely\r\nmisunderstood? Something of the same kind actually happens under our\r\nown eyes in connection with this very disease.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 33.\r\n\r\nStill more important were the effects of these meteorological\r\nconditions on ulcers of the genitals _already in existence_. We\r\nread (loco citato p. 482.): “Even before the beginning of Spring,\r\nconcurrently with the commencement of the cold time, erysipelas made\r\nfrequent appearances sometimes with, sometimes without, visible cause;\r\nit showed itself highly malignant in type, and carried off many. Many\r\nagain suffered from painful affections of the pharynx (anginae,—sore\r\nthroats), loss of voice (affections of the wind-pipe), inflammatory\r\nfevers with delirium, aphthae in the mouth, φύματα (abscesses) in the\r\ngenital organs, ophthalmias, ἄνθρακες (malignant pustules), etc.—Also\r\nmany got erysipelas from external causes, at such spots as these had\r\nhappened to affect them, even after the smallest injuries[193], and\r\nin all parts of the body. Above all sexagenarians suffered in this way\r\nin the head, if they were treated in the smallest degree carelessly.\r\nEven under careful and scientific treatment wide-spread phlegmonous\r\naffections frequently occurred, while the erysipelas spread to a\r\nserious extent and with great rapidity in all directions. In most\r\nof the patients so affected the metamorphosis that succeeded was to\r\nulcerations, whilst _muscles, sinews and bones fell away to a serious\r\ndegree_. But the morbid product that collected did not resemble\r\nordinary matter (pus), but was a sort of putrid _sanies_, occurring\r\nequally in combination and by itself[194]. Such as were attacked in the\r\nhead, became bald over the whole head and chin, the bones were laid\r\nbare and fell away, and such ῥεύματα (morbid discharges) as described\r\noccurred frequently, whether with or without fever. Symptoms of the\r\nkind however were more terrifying than really destructive[195], for\r\namong patients in whom these (ῥεύματα) came to maturity and resulted\r\nin suppuration, the majority were saved; on the contrary many died\r\namong those in whom the phlegmonous affections and the erysipelas\r\ndisappeared, without undergoing any such metamorphosis into other forms\r\nof disease. Moreover the same thing happened to those in whose case\r\n(the morbid product) attacked some other part of the body. For with\r\nmany of them the whole upper and fore arm fell away; while in some\r\npatients the disease attacked the ribs, the sole difference being\r\nwhether some destruction was wrought on their anterior or posterior\r\naspect; in others again the whole thigh or the lower leg or the whole\r\nfoot was laid bare. _But the most dangerous of all was, when this or\r\nthe like happened in the neighbourhood of the private parts or to the\r\nprivate parts themselves_, and the mischief manifested itself in the\r\nform of ulcers, and as the result of external causes. In many patients\r\nsuchlike symptoms occurred during, before, as well as after the\r\nfever”[196].\r\n\r\n_Galen_, who has left us a Commentary on this passage (Vol. XVII.\r\nA.) mentions in the first place that aphthae, φύματα (abscesses)\r\nof the genitals, etc. specifically possessed (p. 661.) nothing of\r\nκακοηθεία (malignity), but only when as in this case they occurred in\r\nconjunction with a putrid general condition. “The putrid character\r\neasily arises even without a pestilential general condition, if the\r\nparts are attacked by phlegmonous affections or erysipelas, and spreads\r\nlikewise over the neighbouring parts lying uppermost; hence it is we\r\nare compelled after cutting away the decayed tissues to cauterize the\r\nplace. It is no wonder then, when such a condition has arisen that\r\nupper and fore-arm, thigh and lower leg, ribs and head are attacked,\r\nif the private parts suffer above all others.—So far the author has\r\ndiscussed those affections of a kind akin to erysipelas which associate\r\nthemselves with ulcerations or other comparatively insignificant\r\nexternal cause; in what follows he speaks of such attacks as occurred\r\nwithout any such occasioning cause”[197].\r\n\r\nNow if we examine these statements, so far as they are of immediate\r\ninterest in view of our object, we may unhesitatingly conclude from\r\nthem, that in Hippocrates’ time a large number of patients suffered\r\nfrom ulcers of the genitals. These it seems under the influence of the\r\nprevailing typhoïdal conditions were assailed by inflammation of an\r\nerysipelas-like type, rapidly passing over into humid gangrene, which\r\nlatter destroyed the parts attacked, readily extended its ravages, and\r\neventually killed the patient. This is an observation which _Galen_\r\nlikewise had frequent occasion to make (so probably under the head of\r\nInfluence of the Climate of Asia, pp. 318, 326, 329.), without any\r\nexactly definite typhoïdal conditions having been prevalent[198], and\r\neven saw himself under these circumstances very generally constrained,\r\nin order to put a stop to the spread of the mortification, _to amputate\r\nthe gangrenous tissue, and afterwards cauterize the wound_. What was\r\nthe origin of these ulcers of the genitals is indeed not stated; but\r\nit is certain they were not invariably conditioned by the prevailing\r\n_genius epidemicus_. Besides, since Hippocrates several times mentions\r\nthem without giving the cause that produced them, it is a more likely\r\nconjecture to suppose that this cause was one universally familiar (it\r\nconsisted in an act of unclean intercourse with women), than to assume\r\nit to have been _absolutely unknown_ to physicians generally[199].\r\n\r\nAgain the result of this investigation is of still more especial\r\ninterest in so far as it enables us to properly appreciate\r\nThucydides’ notice of the so-called _Plague of Athens_.[200] This has\r\nbeen discussed by very many writers, and has given occasion to the\r\nmost widely different explanations. He relates as follows: “For the\r\ndisease which at first had its stronghold in the head, beginning from\r\nabove downwards traversed by degrees the whole body; and even supposing\r\na patient to have escaped the worst, yet a seizure of the extremities\r\nput its mark upon him. For it attacked the genitals and the extremities\r\nof the hands and feet; and many escaped death, but with the loss of\r\nthese parts.” Even more clearly does the poet _Lucretius_[201] paint\r\nthe disease, when he says:\r\n\r\n    Profluvium porro qui tetri sanguinis acre\r\n    Exierat; tamen in nervos huic morbus et artus\r\n    Ibat et _in partes genitales corporis ipsas_,\r\n    Et graviter partim metuentes limina leti\r\n    _Vivebant ferro privati virili_.\r\n\r\n(Then too if any one had escaped the acrid discharge of noisome blood,\r\nthe disease would yet pass into his sinews and joints and onward even\r\n_into the sexual organs of the body_; and some from excessive dread of\r\nthe gates of death _would live bereaved of these parts by the knife_.\r\nMunro’s translation).\r\n\r\nThough we really are concerned only with the last words of Thucydides,\r\nso far as they relate to the genitals, yet what precedes has given\r\noccasion to such extraordinary interpretations that we feel bound to\r\ndevote some attention to this as well. The whole passage proved itself\r\nan especial _stone of stumbling_ to those writers who endeavoured to\r\nidentify the Athenian plague with _scarlet-fever_, as _Malfatti_ did,\r\nor with _small-pox_, like _Scuderi_ and _Kraus_. In fact this is why\r\nthe last named says as he does[202]: “The loss of the private parts\r\nand the extremities (στερισκόμενοι τούτων,—being deprived of these,\r\nwith the loss of these) would certainly seem to point merely to the\r\nloss of the _free use_ of these parts, in consequence of ulcerations,\r\nswellings of the joints, lesions and contractions, for the entire\r\nmembers are not likely to have been destroyed by mortification or\r\namputated by the surgeon? Indeed it is only in deference to the verses\r\nof Lucretius that the latter opinion has become the one generally held;\r\nbut even Ancient commentators[203] have felt that the Roman poet may\r\nvery possibly have mistaken Thucydides’ meaning. Moreover I feel myself\r\ndisposed to agree with them particularly on this ground, that the\r\nmortification of the whole of any of the greater limbs, though it _has_\r\nbeen observed in pestilential fevers, in _Typhus contagiosus putridus_\r\n(putrid infectious Typhus) amongst others, yet makes a comparatively\r\nrare symptom of the disease, and at the same time so dangerous a one\r\nthat it can hardly be, as Thucydides alleges it was, that many (πολλοὶ)\r\nafter such a serious affection escaped death, while on the contrary\r\nsome (εἰσὶ δ’ οἵ) only did so with the loss of the eyes.” Any one who\r\nwill compare the just quoted passages of Hippocrates and Galen with the\r\naccount of Thucydides, will want no further proof that as a matter of\r\nfact mortification of the extremities did supervene, an occurrence that\r\neven in later times[204] is not of the extreme rarity that _Kraus_\r\nand others believe. Again the fact that _many_ of those attacked\r\nescaped with their lives is the less surprising when one remembers that\r\nThucydides is not speaking of entire arms and feet as having fallen\r\noff, but only of ἄκρας χεῖρας καὶ πόδας, that is to say, fingers and\r\ntoes. However supposing any one to prefer not to supply ἄκρων with\r\nτούτων, but take it as used in its full extent, maintaining that\r\nhands and feet as well as genitals were entirely destroyed, even this\r\nwould not belong to the category of _extremely rare_ phenomena, for\r\nHippocrates actually saw the extremities entirely fall off in similar\r\ncircumstances, while if only the ῥεύματα (morbid discharges) came duly\r\nto maturity and maturation supervened, the major part (οἱ πλεῖστοι\r\nτούτων ἐσώζοντο,—the majority of these were saved) escaped with their\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFinally the passage of Thucydides gives no sort of evidence to prove\r\nthat the ἀκρωτηρίων ἀντίληψις (seizure of extremities) occurred solely\r\nin those attacked by the fever as metastasis and so on. For the first\r\nsentence quoted, to the effect that the disease traversed the whole\r\nbody, evidently refers back to the preceding clause ἐπικατιόντος τοῦ\r\nνοσήματος ἐς τὴν κοιλίαν (when the disease descends into the abdomen),\r\nand for this reason is connected with it by the conjunction γὰρ—“for”.\r\nThe succeeding words καὶ εἴ τις ἐκ τῶν μεγίστων περιγένοιτο (and even\r\nsupposing a patient to have escaped the worst) may very well be taken\r\nin this way; μεγίστων (the greatest, worst things) is made not a Neuter\r\nabsolute, like τὰ ἔσχατα (last extremities) and such like phrases\r\nin other places, but κακῶν (evils) is supplied to go with it, and\r\nthe whole translated: “even supposing a patient escaped the greatest\r\nevils”, that is to say if he were not attacked by the λοῖμος (Plague)\r\nin the forms of head and abdominal affections, “yet it marked him”,\r\nthat is it made its existence manifest by gangrene of the extremities\r\nsupervening[205]. This Thucydides, a layman writing on a medical\r\nsubject, supposes to be a mere manifestation of the λοῖμος (Plague),\r\nwhile Hippocrates regarded it as the proof of the erysipelas-putrid\r\ncondition, which caused the already previously existing ulcers etc. to\r\nassume this character.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the fact that at Athens ulcers of the feet\r\nwere of frequent occurrence; and these must, no less than the ulcers\r\nof the genitals previously existing in any case, have necessarily\r\nbeen likewise assailed by the general unhealthy condition of things,\r\nand when this happened, have passed over into gangrene. Thucydides in\r\nfact says expressly at the beginning of his delineation of the disease\r\n(ch. 49.): τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἔτος, ὡς ὡμολογεῖτο, ἐκ πάντων μάλιστα δὴ ἐκεῖνο\r\nἄνοσον ἐς τὰς ἄλλας ἀσθενείας ἐτύγχανεν ὄν. εἰ δέ τις καὶ προέκαμνέ τι,\r\n_ἐς τοῦτο πάντα ἀπεκρίθη_. (For indeed that year, as was universally\r\nadmitted, chanced to be of all years one especially free from other\r\ndiseases in general; and indeed if any one suffered previously from\r\nany complaint, _all ended in this_, the plague.)” We have seen how\r\nHippocrates observed the prevalence of ulcers of the genitals at the\r\nperiod of the special meteorological conditions he drew attention to,\r\nand without doubt in the same way such existed at Athens as well, and\r\nwere subsequently dominated by the prevailing erysipelas-typhoïdal\r\nconditions. This was manifested in one of two ways; either the ulcers\r\nbecame gangrenous, or the patient was attacked by typhus, precisely\r\nas is noted to be the case at the present day[206]. But under either\r\neventuality the existing contagion was annihilated, in the one case\r\nby the general feverish reaction of the organism[207]. But in those\r\ncases where neither fever nor mortification supervened, the contagion\r\nundoubtedly assumed a more strongly effective character, was more\r\nreadily infectious, set up more deeply penetrating ulcerations, and\r\nthe tendency towards the skin being the predominating one, exanthematic\r\neruptions with an inclination to ulcerative forms (ἐκθύματα μεγάλα,\r\nἕρπητες πολλοῖσιν μεγάλοι,—great pustules, extensive creeping eruptions\r\nin many cases) were observed by Hippocrates to be set up in Summer,\r\n(loco citato p. 487.). All these are factors of the highest importance\r\nfor the history of Venereal disease, as it is only by them that we\r\nshall be enabled to solve the great riddle of the origin of Venereal\r\ndisease in the XVth. Century,—a riddle to which the answer would long\r\nago have been found, if only enquirers had not been in the habit almost\r\ndown to our own days of persistently looking upon Venereal disease as\r\nan isolated phænomenon.\r\n\r\nTrue it is impossible from the passage of Thucydides to decide with\r\nany certainty whether the extremities, hands, feet and genitals, fell\r\noff of their own accord or were removed by the knife; but our own\r\nopinion is that both was the case, for of course there were Physicians\r\nat Athens, and until they had learned their powerlessness against the\r\nprevailing sickness, they no doubt employed the remedial means at\r\ntheir disposal, and these consisted according to Hippocrates solely\r\nand simply in the use of scalpel and cauterizing iron, all other\r\nmeasures having proved unavailing. That these were equally resorted to\r\nin ulcerations of the genitals we see from the passage of Galen quoted\r\nabove, and the Poem of the Priapeia, p. 74, confirms the same in the\r\nmost convincing way.\r\n\r\nEnough has been alleged to prove how far the view expressed in many\r\ndifferent forms, to the effect that, in the Athenian Plague as well\r\nas in the meteorological conditions and their results as laid down by\r\nHippocrates, it is a question of Venereal disease, is justified by\r\nfacts, and to show that even in Antiquity materials are to be found to\r\ndemonstrate conclusively that the _genius epidemicus_ exercised a not\r\nunimportant influence on the rise, form and course of the ulcerations\r\nof the genital organs. In what way this influence acted on the\r\ncomplaints consequent on paederastia and the vices of the _cunnilingue_\r\nand the _fellator_ and affecting the posterior and mouth, we cannot\r\nat any rate at the moment demonstrate historically, but it seems only\r\nprobable that previously existing ulcerations in the mouth and throat\r\nmust under an erysipelas-typhoïdal general condition have proved\r\nthemselves in the highest degree dangerous to the sufferers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SECTION.\r\n\r\nInfluences which served to hinder to a greater or less degree the\r\ninception of Diseases consequent upon the Use or Misuse of the Genital\r\nOrgans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 34.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been fully proved in the course of our previous investigations\r\nthat Asia and Egypt must be regarded as the two focus-points of\r\nexaggerated sensual licence, the conditions of climate being most\r\nfavourable in those regions for the generation of affections consequent\r\nupon sexual excesses. So it may be fairly concluded without further\r\nproof that in the same parts of the world attention was early devoted\r\nto the problem how to render such influences,—no mere passing ones, be\r\nit observed, but continuously operative,—as little harmful as possible.\r\nNow in what way could this end be more adequately attained than by\r\n_cleanliness_ carried out to the highest possible degree? As a matter\r\nof history, the merest superficial acquaintance with the customs and\r\nusages of Antiquity clearly shows that equally in Asia and in Egypt\r\nconcern for bodily cleanliness had occupied the particular attention\r\nof both political and sacerdotal Legislators from the most remote\r\nperiod. More than this, it had come to be looked upon by the people\r\nas so entirely necessary, as to be all but inextricably blended with\r\ntheir very life and being. Any idea of vexatious compulsion entirely\r\ndisappeared, and the laws and ordinances directed to this object are in\r\nforce to this day as fully as they were thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nInhabitants of the temperate zone who visited these lands were bound to\r\nthink,—unless they gave more careful consideration to the subject than\r\nmost were likely to do,—such almost universal and such scrupulous care\r\nfor cleanliness exaggerated; and so we find, e. g. the Greek writers,\r\nwho cite many of the usages of this description, invariably referring\r\nto them merely as a sort of curiosity. In later times, e. g. in _St.\r\nAthanasius_,[208] they are even condemned as being prompted by the\r\nDevil, in order to diminish the amount of time to be devoted to pious\r\nexercises. It may well be that in course of time a too scrupulously\r\nprecise dependence on ancestral custom had brought many of these usages\r\ninto ridicule, especially when they were practised in countries where\r\nin some cases the reasons for their observance altogether cease to be\r\noperative. Yet anyone who considers with due care the conditions under\r\nwhich they were originally introduced, will find himself constrained to\r\nadmit that the Lawgiver was only obeying a behest of necessity.\r\n\r\nIf the different customs and usages of the Ancients in connection with\r\ntheir careful attention to cleanliness are examined more minutely, they\r\nare found to be divisible into two classes, according as (1.) their\r\nobject was to prevent uncleanliness, or (2.) to banish it, when once\r\nadmitted. All measures connected with sanitary police supervision, the\r\nenforcement of which in modern civilized States leads to such endless\r\ndifficulties, were almost entirely in the hands of the Priests, to whom\r\nthe People were accustomed to accord an unquestioning obedience. It\r\nwas an easy matter therefore to prevent any injurious contamination\r\nfrom extending over a wide area; it sufficed simply to declare unclean\r\nwhatever might prove injurious to health to ensure its being avoided\r\nin practice,—and in the majority of instances with the most scrupulous\r\ncare. This is a factor in the problem that appears never to have been\r\nproperly appreciated by our Historical Pathologists; otherwise they\r\nmust long ago have abandoned many prejudices regarding the knowledge\r\npossessed by the Ancients as to contagious matter. For how _could_\r\npractical observations be collected on infection and the liability to\r\ninfection, when every possible chance of infection was carefully and\r\ngenerally avoided? Most of the Peoples of Antiquity considered contact\r\nwith a dead body a pollution, more than this, they thought even the\r\nneighbourhood of a corpse to have the same effect. They hung up notices\r\nto warn the passers-by, and placed vessels of water (ἀδάνιον, ὄστρακον,\r\nγάστρα—water-stoup, earthen vessel, water-pot) before the house where\r\na dead man lay, that those who came in and out might be able to purify\r\nthemselves again on the spot[209]. Of course all did not go so far as\r\nthe Persians, who declared every sick person unclean. Still it is a\r\nfact, and this most certainly not merely among the Jews, that all the\r\nvarious infectious skin-diseases that were massed together under the\r\nname of Leprosy[210], and also Gonorrhœa (Clap), made the sufferer,\r\nand also everything he touched, unclean, and caused them to be set\r\napart where no one should come in contact with them; and this continued\r\nso long as the sickness lasted.\r\n\r\nNow does it really need any further proof that these diseases developed\r\na perfectly well-known form of contagious matter: or is an arbitrary\r\nand imaginary theory to be adopted by preference, to the effect that\r\ninjunctions of the sort owed their existence merely to the caprice of\r\nthe Legislator, and were not based on any actual experience of real\r\ndetriment resulting from their neglect in favour of others? At any\r\nrate it is certain that, where these laws were in force and where each\r\nindividual followed them out exactly, a disease that is communicable\r\nonly by close contact could not possibly be disseminated over any wide\r\narea. This could not take place under such circumstances, even though\r\nit had been engendered in its original form and continued prevalent for\r\na long period of time.\r\n\r\nHowever it was not only the sick that were avoided, but all possible\r\ncauses as well that might lead to the disease. It was not only the\r\neffort required and the pain, but most likely the possibility also\r\nof injury resulting, that made the weakly Asiatic forgo the _Jus\r\nprimae noctis_ (Right of the first night), and declare unclean the\r\nsupposed[211] injurious effects of the vaginal blood that flowed on\r\nthe rupture of the hymen, as well as the act of defloration itself.\r\nPollution was guarded against in this case, as it was by the regulation\r\nbanishing women during the time of menstruation from the neighbourhood\r\nof men, a regulation that had the binding force of law amongst almost\r\nall the Nations of Antiquity. The same held good for the time of\r\npurification of women who had been lying-in,[212] a condition which\r\nwas supposed in some unexplained way to be able to exert a possibly\r\ninjurious influence on the genital organs of the husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepilation.\r\n\r\n§ 35.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this it might yet happen that contact with a sick\r\nperson could not be avoided, and all possible causes of the diseases\r\nin question escaped. Attention therefore was naturally directed to the\r\neffort to make the admission of the contagion and of matters having\r\ndeleterious effects as difficult as might be. There were two means for\r\nattaining this end held to be especially effective,—depilation and\r\ncircumcision.\r\n\r\nThe hair as is well known is particularly apt to attract and retain all\r\nkinds of moisture; and it will of course do this in the case of the\r\ngenital secretions, whether healthy or morbid, if they come in contact\r\nwith it. These secretions will the more readily exert an injurious\r\neffect, as each hair is accompanied by at least two cutaneous glands,\r\npossessing an excretory duct or pore, and in those parts of the\r\nbody where a thicker and stronger growth of hair is found, develop a\r\nconsiderably increased degree of activity,—an increased activity which\r\nthey exhibit in any case in hot countries. “Hence too the Priests in\r\nEgypt shave the body carefully; for there is something collects under\r\nthe hair, that must be removed,” _Philo_ says in a passage cited above,\r\nand a fragment of _Theopompus_ preserved by _Athenaeus_[213] also tells\r\nus, that this habit existed also among the Greeks, as well as among\r\ndifferent peoples of Italy.\r\n\r\nIn later times however the habit gradually disappeared in these\r\ncountries; and is only found again at the period of greatest luxury,\r\nwhen the Pathics endeavoured by the removal of hair from all parts\r\nof the body, except the head, to assimilate their outward appearance\r\nto the feminine type[214]. Especially were they bound to rid the\r\nposteriors[215] of hair, as one penetrating into the anus during\r\nunnatural connexion might easily cause small cuts at the orifice, and\r\nproduce chafings of the penis. For the same reason paederasts, as\r\nindeed was the case with all amateurs of Love, invariably took care\r\nto remove all hair from the genitals[216], to avoid endangering the\r\nposterior and the private parts of their mistresses. Even more than\r\nmen, did _women_ seek to remove the hair from their private parts,\r\nas they do to this day in the East. This appears never to have been\r\nthe case among the Jews; but in Asia and in Egypt the custom was\r\nobserved by all classes of the people, and probably from those lands\r\nfirst spread into Greece and Italy. It seems to have been adopted\r\nvery generally by Greek women;[217] but it was _especially_ hetaerae\r\nand “filles de joie”[218] who practised local as well as general\r\ndepilation. A similar state of things must have existed at Rome[219],\r\nwhere older women resorted to the removal of hair from the genitals as\r\na means of concealing their age[220]. In any case whether in Greece\r\nor in Italy the purpose and special object of depilation seems to have\r\nbeen soon lost sight of, and the practice to have been still to some\r\nextent kept up merely as a matter of fashion. Nevertheless it is a\r\nfact that the habit has continued even down to modern times in these\r\ncountries, and is actually followed there to some extent on the ground\r\nof cleanliness[221].\r\n\r\nDepilation is completed by the _polishing_ of the skin with pumice,\r\netc., a treatment that made it very much less liable to take up dirt of\r\nall kinds. This and the _anointing_ of the body, that commonly followed\r\nit, as it did the bath (see later), guarded against the introduction\r\nof foreign matter into the tissues to an important extent, yet without\r\ninterfering with transpiration, which in southern countries takes\r\nplace more by the cutaneous glands than by the sweat-pores. This fact\r\ngoes some way to explain how it was that the contagious plagues of\r\nAntiquity, generally of a transient character, never properly speaking\r\nacquired any wide extension, unless they were carried along with\r\nthe _Genius epidemicus_ at the same time; and that even the latter,\r\nas is the case at the present day, could seldom master and reverse\r\nendemic predispositions. This last consideration merits the particular\r\nattention of the Historical Pathologist, as giving him a partial\r\nindication why Antiquity comes so far behind later times in regard\r\nto startling epidemics, at the same time teaching him to regard Asia\r\nas the home of Endemic, Europe of Epidemic Diseases. This ought to\r\nsafeguard him against many over-hasty conclusions in his views of the\r\nprogressive developement and evolution of disease in general. At the\r\nsame time it will undoubtedly destroy not a few agreeable dreams, where\r\nhe has allowed imagination to outrun reality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCircumcision[222].\r\n\r\n§ 36.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Herodotus_ himself represents circumcision as a very ancient usage\r\neven in his time, as to which it is a moot point whether the Egyptians\r\nor Ethiopians first practised it. From the Egyptians it would seem to\r\nhave passed on to the Phoenicians and Syrians in Palestine, from the\r\nColchians to the Syrians living on the banks of the river Thermodon\r\nand Parthenius and to the Macronians[223]. To the present day we find\r\nCircumcision practised, as all the world knows, among the Mohammedans,\r\nPersians and Jews, among the Kaffirs on the South-East Coast of\r\nAfrica, the Abyssinian Christians[224], the inhabitants of the Pacific\r\nIslands[225], as well on the mainland of America,—and this not merely\r\namong the coast dwellers, but also in several inland districts of South\r\nAmerica[226].\r\n\r\nWithout in this place going into the different reasons that have been\r\nalleged to account for the original introduction of Circumcision,\r\nespecially among the Jews, we may yet say, looking back to our\r\nprevious exposition in § 29., that we hold ourselves bound to see in\r\nCircumcision originally a religious-hygienic measure, intended to guard\r\na part of the body already in the earliest times held in such high\r\nhonour among the Egyptians, Indians etc. as was the penis, against any\r\nprobable chance of defilement by uncleanliness (sebaceous smegma on the\r\n_glans penis_); for it was found that the uncurtailed prepuce made the\r\nmaintenance of a clean _glans penis_ much more difficult, favouring\r\nas it did the collection of the smegma resulting from the sebaceous\r\nsecretions, and thus gave occasion for the formation of pustules and\r\nulcers and the like inconveniences. These were referred not to the\r\nnatural cause, but rather looked upon as a deserved punishment due to\r\nthe anger of the offended deity to whom the penis was sacred, the deity\r\nbeing himself defiled and made unclean by the uncleanliness of the\r\norgan. To escape such anger men were ready enough to remove a part, the\r\ndirect utility of which was as little obvious at the first glance as\r\nthat of the hair that grew in its neighbourhood,—a proceeding they were\r\nthe more willing to agree to, as the mischief the uncurtailed prepuce\r\noccasioned was often enough manifested.\r\n\r\nAt first only the Priests, who of course were at the same time the\r\nPhysicians of primitive Peoples, were allowed to undertake the\r\nperformance of this operation; subsequently it devolved upon the people\r\ngenerally as well, either by direct command or because they were now\r\nconvinced of the utility of circumcision. This utility however must\r\nhave grown less and less frequently visible in proportion as fewer\r\nuncircumcised individuals were left in evidence; and so in the same\r\ndegree the hygienic motive fell more and more into the background.\r\nThus only the religious was left, and this was now taken as the sole\r\nreason and sufficient explanation of the universal custom. Circumcision\r\naccordingly came to be a symbol signifying adoption among such as were\r\ninitiated into the Egyptian Mysteries, and similarly adoption among\r\nthe initiated of the Lord, adoption into the peculiar People of God.\r\nIt is in this fashion the various discordant views as to the origin\r\nof circumcision, all of which proceeded in the first instance from\r\na more or less one-sided point of view, may most satisfactorily be\r\nbrought into agreement. True the motive for the operation was supplied\r\nby a pathological factor, but one which owed its force to a religious\r\nidea, and thus at first the knife was regarded not so much from the\r\n_physician’s_ point of view as from the _religious_ side.\r\n\r\nBut again later, when religious ideas of the sort were more and more\r\ndisappearing before a cool examination of actual nature, when the\r\ntale of diseases originating in the anger of a deity was growing\r\nevery day fewer, belief became impossible in the religious meaning of\r\ncircumcision, or indeed such belief was deliberately rejected, now\r\nthat a clear and natural explanation of the rite was to be found. The\r\nreligious motive in turn made way for the medical-hygienic, as in\r\n_Philo_ in the passage quoted above, and even Our Lord seems to have\r\nheld no other view of the rite, when he says[227]: “If a man received\r\ncircumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken;\r\nare ye wroth with me, because I _made a man every whit whole_ on the\r\nsabbath?” _De Wette_ in his Translation adds: “that is to say, not\r\nsimply, as in circumcision, in one member, but in the whole body.” In\r\nfact the question is here of the healing of the man “which had been\r\nthirty and eight years in his infirmity” (Ch. V.), whom Christ had\r\nmade whole at the Pool of Bethesda on the Sabbath, for which reason\r\nthe Jews wished to put him to death. The sick man was afflicted in his\r\nwhole body, i. e. in every limb, for without help he could not leave\r\nhis bed and go down into the Pool. Thus Christ we see contrasts the\r\nhealing of all the members with circumcision, making it plain that in\r\nhis view the latter makes whole merely a single member, the penis, or\r\nat least puts it in such a condition that it cannot become sick (ὑγιῆ\r\nἐποίησα,—I made whole); accordingly the rite possessed for him only a\r\npurely medico-hygienic aim.\r\n\r\nAs to the introduction of Circumcision among the Jews, this may very\r\nlikely, as we have already pointed, have taken place in the following\r\nmode: Evidently the Jews when in Egypt were not yet circumcised, as\r\nthe speech of the lord Joshua clearly implies, “This day have I taken\r\nthe reproach of Egypt from off you;” for in the eyes of the Egyptians\r\nthe uncircumcised condition of the Jews was a reproach, just as in\r\nlater times “Uncircumcised” was the strongest word of abuse with\r\nthe Jews themselves.[228] Moses brought up by the Egyptian Priests,\r\ninitiated into their secret wisdom, must necessarily have been\r\ncircumcised, and so have known the hygienic as well as religious point\r\nof view. Convinced of its expediency, he determined to introduce it\r\namong the Jews, in order to make them by outward sign in some sort\r\na holy and pure priestly Nation.[229] For this reason we find the\r\ncommand to circumcise on the eighth day after birth specified among\r\nthe _Laws of Purification_,[230] yet without any further supplemental\r\naddition,—which would certainly not have been omitted, if it had at\r\nthat time been regarded as a symbolic sign of covenant. Circumcision\r\ndid not yet possess its purely symbolic meaning; and so it is not yet\r\nincluded among the laws given at Sinai, where the blood of the Burnt\r\nOfferings seals the covenant with God.\r\n\r\nBut subsequently when the Jews at Shittim gave themselves to the\r\nlicentious worship of Baal Peor, not merely the expediency stood out\r\nin glaring conspicuousness, but the positive necessity of observing\r\nthe laws of purity in general, including that of circumcision in\r\nparticular. Thus the long conceived idea of Moses came to maturity,\r\nto enjoin upon the People the rite of circumcision as special symbol\r\nof unity with Jehovah; though he could not hope to bring about its\r\nuniversal adoption by adults, until these were on the point of actually\r\nsetting foot on the Promised Land. This could only be after the death\r\nof Moses; consequently it was Joshua at Arolath who first circumcised\r\nall those who had been born in the Wilderness. Now all the sufferings\r\nof the march were forgotten, the land flowing with milk and honey,\r\nthat was to content all their highest wishes, lay before their eyes,\r\nand so they were willing enough to consent to purchase its everlasting\r\npossession at the cost of what is certainly a painful, but at the same\r\ntime on the whole only a trifling, operation. But then when every male\r\nwas circumcised, there was no longer any evidence, as explained above,\r\nto convince people of the necessity of the observance, and thus for\r\nthe future Circumcision appeared in the guise of a _purely_ religious\r\nsymbol, as the sacramental outward and visible sign of adoption into\r\nsonship with Jehovah,—a point of view subsequently consistently kept to\r\nthroughout the Old Testament.\r\n\r\nFinally with regard to the notion, expressed in many different forms,\r\nthat Circumcision was originally introduced on behalf of increased\r\nfruitfulness on the part of the Sons of Abraham,[231]—an idea found as\r\nearly as in the pages of _Philo Judaeus_, it would appear not to be\r\nso much the greater length of the foreskin that came into question,\r\nbut rather the same general reasons that ensured a condition of\r\ncleanliness in the procreative organs; for the alleged interruption\r\nof the ejaculation of the semen owing to the excessive length of the\r\nforeskin can after all only occur, if the latter is at the same time\r\nunduly contracted at its orifice in such a way that during the act of\r\ncoition it cannot be drawn back over the _glans_. Supposing, as we\r\nhave seen to be the case, complaints affecting the _glans penis_ when\r\ncovered with the normal prepuce to be readily set up through climatic\r\ninfluences, the free use of the organ of procreation must of course\r\nin this way have been interfered with, or even in extreme cases,\r\ncompletely prevented. But inasmuch as the Jew, in this resembling most\r\nof the Nations of Antiquity, made a numerous posterity his highest\r\nglory,[232] and as this could only be obtained on the condition of\r\na healthy procreative member, every endeavour must obviously have\r\nbeen made to remove anything likely to be prejudicial to the part\r\nso profoundly reverenced, anything capable of disturbing, or even\r\naltogether frustrating, the due performance of its functions.\r\n\r\nBut just as this removal of a part of the prepuce, and the consequent\r\nincreased possibilities of cleanliness of the _glans_, more or\r\nless counteracted the injurious effects of Climate tending to set\r\nup diseases of the _glans penis_ in general, it must have equally\r\nexercised as against possible affections of this part resulting from\r\ncoition a certain prophylactic influence,—though undoubtedly this was\r\nnot _so_ great as it has been in some quarters represented to be, as we\r\nintend to explain more fully elsewhere. Hence to some extent, but only\r\nto a limited extent, can the practice of circumcision be regarded as\r\na proof of the existence of Venereal disease in Antiquity; but at the\r\nsame time to refer it to this as _sole_ motive, as _Stoll_[233] does,\r\nis quite inadmissible.\r\n\r\nWhat has here been said of _the Circumcision of men_, holds good also\r\nin the main of _that of maids and women_. This consists in the removal\r\nof the _praeputium clitoridis_; but neither the amputation of the\r\nClitoris itself in so-called _Tribads_ must be confounded with it,\r\nnor yet the operation on the exaggerated nymphae or inner _labia_, of\r\nwomen. The Arabs, among whom this practice,—female circumcision,—is\r\nespecially rife at the present day as it was of old,[234] call the\r\npart that is subjected to circumcision نوي (_nava_), the circumcision\r\nitself خفض (_battar_) or خفض (_chaphad_), and what is cut away in\r\ncircumcision بظر (_bätr_). Usually the circumcision of maids is first\r\nperformed on the completion of the tenth year by women who make it\r\ntheir special business and who are known as مبظّرة (_mobatterat_).\r\nThese women perambulate the streets and openly call out, “Any maids to\r\ncircumcise?”[235] Besides the Arabs, Circumcision of maids is to be\r\nfound among the Copts or modern Egyptians,[236] the Ethiopians,[237] in\r\nsome districts of Persia,[238] among the Negroes in Bambuk[239] and the\r\nPanos in the province of Maynas in South America, the latter actually\r\nrestricting the practice to the women.[240]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaths and Bathing.\r\n\r\n§ 37.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of all precautions adopted it was impossible to keep away\r\neverything unclean from the body, while this latter by its own\r\nexcrements was constantly making itself more or less unclean;[241]\r\nhence it was only natural that from the most primitive times men’s\r\nattention was directed towards means of removing the uncleanliness so\r\ncontracted. But the defilement was never more than an external one;\r\nit concerned merely the skin and the orifices of the mucous membrane,\r\nwhile the matter requiring removal was of a sort soluble in water, and\r\nthus water was always the chief and foremost means employed to secure\r\ncleanliness. Doctrines of Cosmogony further confirmed the practice;\r\nthese made water the origin of all things, a direct effluence of the\r\ndeity and therefore itself divine,—a means not only of purification,\r\nbut of sanctification as well.\r\n\r\n    Θάλασσα κλύζει πάντα τἀνθρώπων κακά,\r\n\r\n(The sea washes away all evils of mankind) was the refrain, one that\r\nresounds to this day in our ears from the East; so that we cannot\r\nwonder that baths and bathing formed a capital factor both in the\r\npublic and private life of the Ancients. Whatever view might be taken\r\nof sexual intercourse, all agreed in this, that a certain defilement\r\nwas connected with it, which (as follows indeed from our exposition on\r\nearlier pages) might easily become injurious to the organs brought into\r\nactivity, and could only be obviated by dint of _baths_ and a system of\r\n_bathing_.[242]\r\n\r\nThus we read in _Herodotus_:[243] “But as often as a _Babylonian_ has\r\nhad intercourse with his wife, he sits down beside a lighted censer,\r\nand his wife does the same on the opposite side; then when morning has\r\ncome, both _bathe_ themselves, for they will touch no vessel until they\r\nhave washed. The same practice is followed by the _Arabians_ too.”\r\nWhether bathing after _each_ act of coition was a national custom\r\nof the _Egyptians_, we have been unable to discover, but _Clement\r\nof Alexandria_[244] states that they were forbidden, as was almost\r\neverywhere the case in Antiquity, to enter the temple without having\r\nwashed or bathed themselves after sexual intercourse; while the Priests\r\nwere bound to bathe after every nocturnal pollution.[245] This was\r\nequally an ordinance of the _Jews_, who at the same time were rendered\r\nby such pollution unclean till the evening. The last named People\r\nwere also obliged to wash after every act of coition; at any rate\r\n_Josephus_[246] and _Philo_[247] declare it to have been so, for in\r\nthe Old Testament it is nowhere enjoined. As is generally known, this\r\ncustom has been kept up in the East down to the present day, even among\r\nthe Christian populations,—affording a concurrent testimony to the\r\nnecessity for its observance in these countries.\r\n\r\nWhether the _Greeks_ deliberately and with intention made use of baths\r\nand bathing immediately after sexual intercourse, it is difficult to\r\nascertain quite for certain; but it seems probable, as not only does\r\nMythology more than once[248] make express mention of the bath after\r\ncoition, but the phrase ὅσιος ἀπ’ εὐνᾶς ὤν (being holy, purified,\r\nafter the couch) points to the same conclusion. Moreover there is a\r\npassage in _Lucian_,[249]—though it is quite true he often describes\r\nRoman customs,—that might be thought to prove the same.\r\n\r\nClearer indications are forthcoming in the case of the _Romans_, who\r\nnot only must not undertake any sacred function or enter a Temple, if\r\nthey had failed to bathe after carrying out coition,[250] but were\r\nalso bound generally after every act of cohabitation to wash the\r\nparts brought into use. At any rate this holds good of the women,\r\nand so applies to the Roman matron (comp. the passage of _Suetonius_\r\nquoted in § 27) as to Atia, the mother of Augustus, as well as in an\r\neven greater degree to the amica (mistress) or courtesan. The regular\r\nname for this was _aquam sumere_ (to take water).[251] Indeed there\r\nwere actually special attendants _aquarioli_ (water-boys),[252] whose\r\nbusiness it was not merely to fetch water for this purpose, but\r\nalso in particular to bathe and cleanse the “filles de joie” after\r\nsexual intercourse. For this reason _Lampridius_ says of the Emperor\r\nCommodus (ch. 2), _aquam gessit, ut lenonum ministeriis probrosis natum\r\nmagis, quam in loco crederes, ad quem fortuna pervexit_ (he fetched\r\nwater, so that you would more readily suppose him born to perform the\r\nshameful offices of pandars than in the station whereto fortune raised\r\nhim). Such cleanliness was especially obligatory on those who had to\r\ndo with the preparation of food and drink, such as bakers, cooks and\r\nbutlers;[253] and if we do not find it directly enjoined among many\r\nancient Peoples, the only reason of this is that they were already\r\naccustomed to wash and bathe every morning[254] immediately on leaving\r\ntheir bed.\r\n\r\nIn the same way as after natural coition the parts brought into use\r\nwere bathed and washed, this was also done after _unnatural_, and so we\r\nread in the Collection of Priapeia (Carm. 40.):\r\n\r\n    Falce minax et parte tui maiore, Priape,\r\n      Ad fontem, quaeso, dic mihi qua sit iter?\r\n    Vade per has vites, quarum si carpseris uvas\r\n      Quas aliter sumas, hospes, habebis aquas—\r\n\r\n(Standing in threatening attitude with my bristling pruning-knife\r\nand your better part, Priapus, I enquire: “Pri’thee tell me, which\r\nis my way to the fountain?” “Go through yonder vines, but if you\r\ndare to pluck the grapes, you will find, stranger, _water you must\r\ntake_ elsewhere”). Clearly this is to be taken as meaning paederastia\r\nor irrumation looked upon as punishments inflicted for the theft\r\ncontemplated; and shows us at the same time it was not without a\r\n“double entendre” that Priapus was set up as a direction-post to\r\nfountains, a point that _Lomeier_[255] has already brought out with\r\nperfect correctness. Again the _fellator_ after his work used to\r\ncleanse the mouth with water, as we learn from several passages in\r\n_Martial_; thus amongst other places we read in one, of Lesbia,[256]\r\n\r\n    Quod fellas et aquam potes, nil Lesbia peccas,\r\n    Qua tibi parte opus est, Lesbia, sumis aquam.\r\n\r\n(You _fellate_ and then drink water; you do no wrong in this, Lesbia;\r\nwhere lies your work, there Lesbia you _take water_).\r\n\r\nIf we further add to this scrupulous cleanliness the quiet life led by\r\nthe women of Antiquity, who spent most of their time, as women still do\r\nin the East, reclining, it is evident that in spite of the predisposing\r\ninfluence of Climate, injurious secretions from the vagina and uterus,\r\nor indeed ulcerations of these parts, must—speaking generally, and in\r\nproportion—have occurred but rarely. Moreover such maladies of the\r\nsort as were contracted were quickly got rid of again spontaneously,\r\nfor very often even at the present day rest and cleanliness suffice by\r\nthemselves for the removal of primary affections of the genitals. On\r\nthe other hand it cannot be denied that a careless non-observance of\r\nthese primeval laws of cleanliness must have then avenged itself all\r\nthe more severely on the offending individual, and given occasion for\r\nthe setting up of incurable diseases.\r\n\r\nBut great as the counteracting effect of the frequent use of baths\r\nin Antiquity was on the rise of diseases in general, and of those\r\nresulting from sexual excesses in particular, none the less in other\r\nways did these same baths, directly or indirectly, _give occasion\r\nfor their rise and spread_. As to their _direct_ effect in this\r\ndirection,—we certainly find but scanty evidence of any in the\r\nauthorities, and even such as _are_ forthcoming may very possibly be\r\nreferred to the head of general want of cleanliness[257]. Still in\r\nview of the fact that at the present day the cellar baths of the Jews\r\ncontribute to some degree to the spread of disease, and especially of\r\nskin-disease of different types, as did baths generally in the Middle\r\nAges, the conjecture is surely justified that similar results followed\r\nin Antiquity, especially at Rome under the Emperors.\r\n\r\n_Indirectly_ maladies consequent upon sexual excesses were helped on by\r\nthe mere fact that the ancient Baths afforded manifold opportunities\r\nfor such excesses. The bath-attendants, or _aquarioli_ (water-boys),\r\nwho fetched the water for bathing, not only carried on vicious\r\npractices with the women frequenting the place themselves, but also\r\nmade a business of procuration, as already pointed out just above, p.\r\n214. The lascivious Roman Ladies took their own slaves with them to\r\nthe Baths, that they might attend upon their mistresses.[258] At first\r\nthe same bathing Establishments were used equally by both sexes, but\r\nnot at the same time; and according to _Dio Cassius_,[259] _Agrippa_\r\nwould appear to have first, 721 A. U. C., established the public Baths\r\nat Rome for men and women, from which place later on Baths open to\r\nboth sexes were introduced into Greece, as _Plutarch_[260] states.\r\nThe Greeks called these Establishments ἀνδρόγυνα λούτρα (men-women,\r\nmale-female, baths), and used to set up an image of Hermaphroditus\r\nin front of them.[261] In the Imperial period, when all shame was\r\nlaid aside and Heliogabalus himself _in balneis semper cum mulieribus\r\nfuit_ (always visited the Baths in company of the women) (_Lampridius_\r\nch. 2), the use of the Baths both by men and women, and this at the\r\nsame time, had become an established custom, as may be seen from\r\nseveral passages of _Martial_;[262] and it was in vain the Emperors\r\n_Hadrian_,[263] _Marcus Antoninus_[264] and _Alexander Severus_[265]\r\nendeavoured to restrain the abuse by enactments. These were just as\r\nunavailing as were the invectives of the Fathers of the Church.[266]\r\n\r\nThe Bathing Apartments, from which antique Roman modesty had excluded\r\nalmost every glimmer of external light, were now patent to the eyes\r\nof the passer-by. Fitted up with every device of the most refined\r\nluxury,[267] they were transformed into regular brothels;[268] and\r\naccordingly were not allowed to open their doors earlier than one hour\r\nbefore the ordinary establishments of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe same opportunities which the Baths gave for vice with women, they\r\nafforded no less for vice between men,—for paederastia. There it was\r\nthat amateurs looked about for _bene vasatos_ and καλλιπύγους, (men\r\nwith fine instruments, men with handsome buttocks), and this among the\r\nGreeks as well as among the Romans,[269] though the latter in this as\r\nin other things beat the record of all other nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD SECTION.\r\n\r\nRelation of the Physician to Diseases consequent upon the Use or Misuse\r\nof the Genital Organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 38.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding Sections we have become acquainted with the various\r\ninfluences capable of favouring or counteracting the rise of diseases\r\nconsequent upon the use or misuse of the genitals in Antiquity. At\r\nthe same time we have shown how a multitude of affections of the most\r\ndifferent kinds attacked, as a result of the unnatural gratification\r\nof sexual desire, those parts which under these circumstances had\r\nto undertake the rôle of the genital organs of the one or the other\r\nsex. Thirdly we have brought forward in the course of the enquiry at\r\nany rate some examples, proving beyond a doubt that the sexual parts\r\nthemselves too under favourable external conditions sometimes became\r\ndiseased as the consequence of indulgence in sexual intercourse.\r\nStill these results were for the most part based on the evidence\r\nof non-medical Writers, for of set purpose we abstained as much as\r\npossible from calling the professional Writers into Court on these\r\npoints, so as to be able to treat in their proper mutual connexion\r\nwhatever statements these latter have left us as to the maladies in\r\nquestion. This course appeared to us all the more necessary, as it is\r\nprecisely the medical evidence which the opponents of the existence of\r\nVenereal disease in Antiquity believe themselves able to utilize in\r\njustification of their opinions.\r\n\r\nBut before we proceed to the detailed examination of the actual\r\nstatements, it would seem expedient to get an answer to the following\r\nquestion: _whether indeed the Physicians of Antiquity generally were in\r\na position to acquire an adequate knowledge of the bodily consequences\r\nof vicious living?_ In fact on the correct answer to this question\r\nobviously depends the correct appreciation of the medical Writings as\r\nsources for the History of Venereal disease. Only under the condition\r\nthat this question may be answered in the affirmative, can the evidence\r\nsupplied by the Physicians be regarded as satisfactory for their own\r\nperiod. That it cannot of course be so for all periods, has been\r\npointed out already in our examination of the authorities for Antiquity\r\ngenerally. Indeed for long periods of time Physicians had no special\r\n_locus standi_, inasmuch as each individual in the case of the most\r\nusual maladies endeavoured to help himself, and if the family recipes\r\nleft him stranded, then betook himself with prayers for assistance to\r\nthe Gods and their intermediaries on earth, the Priests. This still\r\ncontinued, even after the Physicians had won their recognition as\r\na special profession, and we find accordingly throughout Antiquity\r\npopular, sacerdotal, and professional or _medical_ medicine, if we may\r\nbe allowed the expression, continuing to exist simultaneously side by\r\nside, and not a trace anywhere of the ridiculous limitation according\r\nto which no man has a right to be well without the help of a doctor.\r\n\r\nNow having made it clear by what we have said, that in order to gain\r\nknowledge of a disease in Antiquity it is by no means enough to go to\r\nthe Physicians only, even when such existed, that the latter should\r\nnever be regarded as sole possessors of whatever was known from the\r\npoint of view of pathology and therapeutics, we are bound to apply\r\nthe same rule in the case of diseases consequent upon vicious habits.\r\nOf this the foregoing Sections contain amply sufficient proofs. It has\r\nthere been shown how the genital organs were under the protection of\r\nspecial deities. Diseases affecting them were ascribed to the vengeance\r\nof the said deities, as at Athens to Dionysus, at Lampsacus to Priapus.\r\nTo them sufferers had recourse to win by their prayers the removal of\r\nthe divine anger, as well as its consequences; and all this happened\r\nnot only in times when Physicians did not as yet exist, but no less\r\nwhen they did and in defiance of them, as the poems of the Priapeia\r\nsufficiently prove.[270] How long these ideas lived on is shown by the\r\npictures _Philo_ (p. 315) and _Palladius_ (p. 318) draw of their times,\r\nwhile the XVth. and XVIth. Centuries reproduced the same scenes.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious reason for this no doubt was the _enigma presented\r\nby the origin_ of diseases of the genitals, particularly for any one\r\nunacquainted with the existence of contagions and their modes of\r\nactivity. The man who with a healthy penis had accomplished coition,\r\nobserved some days afterwards, though without resenting the fact, a\r\nmucous discharge to have been set up, or an ulcer, pustule, or what\r\nnot, to have appeared. The cause of these affections he sought for in\r\nvain, for of course the mere act of coition was the very last thing he\r\nwas likely to regard as such. Rather accustomed, wherever the cause of\r\nany phænomenon was unknown to him, to ascribe it to the intervention\r\nof the deity, he saw in his complaint likewise the Θεῖον (divine) as\r\neventual cause. Naturally therefore it was divine assistance, and\r\nnot human, that would avail to relieve him of his pain. Long after\r\nthis time moreover, when men had ceased to refer all diseases to the\r\nvengeance of the gods, and now discovered natural causes for maladies\r\nof the genitals, as for other diseases, anything rather than just\r\nthe act of coition was looked upon as cause of the observed effects,\r\nas indeed is the case to this day among the Turks,[271] and as the\r\nearliest Writers on Venereal disease abundantly show to have been so\r\nin their time. That the Physicians were no exceptions to this rule, we\r\nshall show on a later page.\r\n\r\nA much more weighty reason however why the patient attacked by some\r\naffection of the genitals turned not to men (Physicians) for help, but\r\nto the Gods, and the Priests who represented them, was the feeling of\r\n_shame_. Since first Adam and Eve had recourse to the fig-leaf, it has\r\never been a habit among all peoples of the ancient as of the modern\r\nworld to withdraw the procreative parts from the view of others by\r\ncovering them. But above all did the Ancients regard the exposure of\r\nthese parts[272] one of the severest trials to which modesty could be\r\nexposed; and rightly enough therefore designate them by the name of\r\n_pudenda_, αἰδοῖα, _the parts of shame_. Neither the wide extension of\r\nPhallic worship, nor yet the compulsory exposure of the Ephebi[273] and\r\nthe naked exercises of maidens and youths at Sparta[274], can fairly\r\nbe cited in this connexion as proofs to the contrary.\r\n\r\nIn our own day the most accomplished voluptuaries are in no wise\r\nshocked at undertaking in secret the most shameful doings, but yet\r\nwhen it comes to showing the Physician the diseased instruments of\r\ntheir bestial lusts, often put this off so long as to run great risks\r\nof entirely losing the signs of their manhood; and without a doubt it\r\nwas the same at the period when habitual depravity had reached its\r\nculminating point of enormity. Even Priapus himself asks (Carm. 3):\r\n\r\n    Nec mihi sit crimen, quod mentula semper operta est.\r\n\r\n(Nor let it be laid as a crime against me, that my member is ever\r\ncovered up.) If with this is compared the poem from the Priapeia\r\nquoted on p. 74 of Vol. I., no one can fail to agree with us when we\r\nsay that the field of observation open to Physicians in Antiquity\r\nwith regard to diseases of the genitals can never have been at all\r\nextended. Even the Priests, at any rate in later times, were only\r\nresorted to in the more serious instances; but even so their journals\r\nof cases, supposing them ever to have kept such, would have been a far\r\nbetter source of information than those of the Physicians. We find a\r\nconfirmation of this in the Mosaic Books of the Law, which contain the\r\nearliest and clearest delineations we possess of affections of the\r\ngenital organs both in men and women.\r\n\r\nBut if men were so reluctant, how much more so must women have\r\nbeen, who were universally held to have committed a crime if they\r\nhad given any part of their body to the eyes of a stranger. Just as\r\nthe assistance of the Physician was disdained in childbirth, and to\r\naccount for the fact the fable of Agnodicé invented, in the same way\r\nin complaints of the genitals women hesitated to submit themselves to\r\nthe inquisition of the Physician. But seeing the female sexual organs\r\nare pre-eminently the home and breeding place of Venereal disease,\r\nthis closed what was precisely the most direct way to a correct\r\nunderstanding of maladies of the genitals. The ancient Physicians,\r\nlike our own forefathers, could at best make leucorrhœa the universal\r\nscape-goat; and accordingly even _Galen_, as we shall find presently,\r\nlaid no stress on the circumstance, and drew no inference from it, that\r\nwherever men were attacked by gonorrhœa, the women with whom they had\r\nhad coition likewise suffered from the complaint.\r\n\r\nFurther, to this general sense of shame was added a certain timidity\r\nbefore the professional status of real Physicians as a class, as well\r\nas the pretty universally prevalent idea of the _ignominiousness of a\r\nsickness brought on by a person’s own fault_, at any rate among the\r\neducated part of the population. This comes out in the following\r\npassage of _Plato_,[275] where he says: “Does it appear to you\r\ndisgraceful to stand in need of medical help, when it is not wounds at\r\nall or such sicknesses as depend on the seasons that have befallen, but\r\nwhen a man through indolence and a way of life such as we have noted\r\n(i. e. a very luxurious one), is filled full of fluxes and accumulations\r\nof wind like a sea, giving occasion to the noble sons of Asclepius\r\nto designate these complaints by the names of superfetations and\r\ncatarrhs?” This was more than a mere expression of individual opinion;\r\nthere is no doubt affections of the genital organs, more especially if\r\ntheir relation to sexual intercourse was known, belonged to the class\r\nof diseases held to be most disgraceful,[276] and the Poet is justified\r\nin saying:\r\n\r\n    _Diis me legitimis nimisque magnis_\r\n    Ut Phoebo puta, filioque Phoebi\r\n    _Curatum dare mentulam verebar_.\r\n\r\n(To the lawful gods, deities too exalted for me, such for instance as\r\nPhoebus, and Phoebus’ son, I feared to entrust my member for cure.)\r\nThus it was not to the “noble sons of Asclepius”, in other words the\r\nPhysicians, who treated freemen only, that patients resorted for help,\r\nbut to the gods, or else to the medical underlings (ὑπηρέται τῶν\r\nἰατρῶν,—subordinate assistants of the physicians), to the slave-doctors\r\nand quacks, who plied their trade in the doctor’s shops,—establishments\r\nwhere, as we have seen above, paederasts and pathics foregathered.\r\nExactly the same state of things prevailed down to the middle of the\r\nlast Century; and to this day a majority of such sufferers rarely as a\r\nmatter of fact come under any other hands.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge and observations of these Cullers of simples and\r\nCompounders of balsams, if indeed as a rule they really possessed the\r\nformer, or knew how to make the latter, necessarily perished on their\r\ndecease, or at best were passed on by tradition to their successors in\r\nthe doctor’s shops, without professional Physicians or medical Science\r\nbeing one whit advantaged. To such men it was a matter of perfect\r\nindifference what was the origin of the disease for which they sold\r\ntheir powders and decoctions, for as _Plato_ (De legg. IV. 720) says,\r\nthey paid no attention to the existing conditions of disease, and did\r\nnot care to give a thought to any such thing. But at any rate,—and this\r\nwas the chief point,—the patient was spared a humiliating confession,\r\nand was glad enough to buy the privilege even at the cost of possible\r\nruin to his health. We must further remember that the “filles de joie”\r\nin Greece and at Rome were mostly slave-women, who from the very\r\nfact of their status could make no claim to treatment by free-born\r\nphysicians, and that during the flourishing period of Greek medicine\r\nunder the Hippocratic school it was chiefly persons of the lowest\r\nstation or else sailors and foreign traders and the like who sought\r\nenjoyment in the arms of prostitutes. Such men by their constant\r\nchange of abode made all continued observation a simple impossibility,\r\nso that the very imperfect knowledge possessed by the scientifically\r\ntrained Physicians with regard to diseases of the genitals and their\r\nconsequences need occasion little surprise.\r\n\r\nIt is true of course that at the period of universal degradation\r\nof morals Physicians must have found no lack of opportunities for\r\nobservation; but the great majority of them were incapable of utilizing\r\nthese, actually blocked the way of set purpose, as we shall see\r\npresently, that led in the direction of more accurate investigation,\r\nor else troubled their heads little about the cultivation of Science\r\nor the systematic record of observations. The latter, if they had\r\npublished them, whether in writing or orally, could only have been\r\ndetrimental, particularly in the case of physicians of the character\r\nof Charidemus’ medical attendant,[277] to their own interests. In\r\nfact they were bound to call all their subtlety into play for the\r\nexpress purpose of concealing the true cause of diseases of this type,\r\na circumstance which no doubt we have to thank for a large number of\r\nthe extravagant and often more than ludicrous statements regarding the\r\norigin of Venereal disease in the XVth. and XVIth. Centuries.\r\n\r\nBut as a matter of fact the public itself was no less careful to\r\nguard the secret, as we gather from _Martial_,[278] as well as from\r\nthe fact that _Galen_ felt himself constrained even in his day to\r\ncompose a special Treatise on dissimulated diseases. This sort of\r\nintentional deception on the part of patients was so much the easier,\r\nas Physicians in those times, as said above, in virtue of their\r\npathological views,—some of which indeed may very well have originated\r\nin this way,—were little accessible to the truth. For these reasons\r\nthey deserved, at any rate to some degree, the satiric lash of Martial;\r\nand were very generally ridiculed by the more discerning of the laity.\r\nThis comes out in the important words of _Appuleius_ (Metamorph.\r\nX. 211.) as follows: “Crederes et illam fluctuare tantum vaporibus\r\nfebrium: nisi quod et flebat: _Heu medicorum ignavae mentes!_ Quid\r\nvenae pulsus, quid caloris intemperantia, quid fatigatus anhelitus\r\net utrimque secus iactatae crebriter laterum mutuae vicissitudines?\r\n_Dii boni! Quam facilis, licet non artifici medico, cuivis tamen docto\r\nvenereae cupidinis comprehensio_, cum videas aliquem sine corporis\r\ncalore flagrantem.” (Could you imagine her so tempest-tossed by the\r\nvapours of mere fever,—not to mention that she kept forever crying:\r\n“_Oh! the sorry wits of doctors!_” What means the throbbing vein,\r\nthe excessive temperature, the labouring breath, and the hurried\r\ninterchange of heaving flank, panting now on one side now on the other?\r\n_Great heavens! how easy the diagnosis, not of course for a medical\r\nexpert, but for any one learned in the symptoms of love_, when you see\r\na person burning, yet without bodily fever-heat).\r\n\r\nBut does all this justify us in casting a stone at our medical\r\ncolleagues of Ancient times? For the last three hundred years we\r\nimagine ourselves clearly acquainted with Venereal disease and all its\r\nforms; yet how many a bubo has been mistaken for a strangulated hernia,\r\nanal callosity, or the like, how many a case of vaginal gonorrhœa\r\nfor simple _fluor albus_ (white discharge, leucorrhœa), how many a\r\ncondyloma on the posteriors for hæmorrhoidal swellings, and accordingly\r\nnot treated as the physician in _Juvenal_, _medico ridente_ (the\r\nphysician grinning the while), treated them,—that is duly cut away or\r\nligatured?\r\n\r\nLastly to all these reasons was added further the _mildness and\r\nabsence of danger characterizing the disease_ itself, at any rate in\r\nthe majority of instances,—as proved in our earlier investigations.\r\nTo our own day genuine amateurs of Love, thanks to those who supply\r\n“advice, direction and information” on these subjects, endeavour as a\r\nrule, at any rate in the earlier stages, to cure without assistance the\r\nwounds received in the fight. This was equally so in Antiquity, as the\r\nfollowing significant passage of _Galen_[279] shows: “This is pretty\r\nwell all I have to say at present as to ephemeral fevers. For _patients\r\nwho have contracted fever consequent upon a bubo, do not consult\r\nphysicians as to what they must do; but after first treating the ulcer\r\nwhich occasioned the bubo and then the bubo itself_, bathe after the\r\nabatement of the severity of the attack. After that if any one says a\r\nword as to the “diatriton” (fast till the third day), all laugh and\r\ndeclare him a precisian: I suppose because they are of the opinion that\r\nnothing must be resigned to nature that is not invariably there.”\r\n\r\nWe know quite well that the Ancients called all glandular swellings\r\nbuboes, and that they were perfectly well acquainted[280] with those\r\nglandular swellings in the arm-pits and the groin which follow upon\r\nulcers of the fingers and toes; but this in no way justifies us in\r\nreferring the above passage, which is certainly written in a general\r\nsense, _solely_ to suchlike buboes and not equally to those in the\r\nsoft tissues; more particularly as _Galen_, in the place where he is\r\ndealing expressly with the treatment of buboes and the phlegmonous\r\naffections preceding them and occasioning ulcers (loco citato p. 881),\r\nexplicitly mentions phlegmonous symptoms as κατὰ αἰδοῖον (affecting the\r\nprivates) and γυναικὶ κατὰ μήτραν ἢ αἰδοῖον (in women affecting womb\r\nand privates),—loco citato p. 893. Hence we think ourselves justified\r\nin drawing attention to the passage as containing an indication of\r\nthe reason why ulcers of the genital organs pursued a milder course\r\nand admitted of an easier cure in Antiquity, because the _ephemera_\r\nevidently facilitated the assimilation and elimination of the\r\ncontagion, this taking place either at the point primarily attacked,\r\nor else occurring because it (the ephemeral fever) led to an enhanced\r\nactivity of the cutaneous glands by provoking an exanthematous eruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 39.\r\n\r\nBut for no small part of this reluctance on the part of patients the\r\nPhysicians were themselves to blame. We have no wish in this place\r\nto enlarge upon the possibility of professional indiscretion in\r\ntheir case, though long ago the Hippocratic masters saw themselves\r\nconstrained to guard their scholars against it.[281] Of far greater\r\nweight was the nature of the _treatment_, especially that applied to\r\nulcers of all kinds, which was excellently adapted to fill sufferers\r\nwith fear and trembling. Already _Hippocrates_[282] taught that\r\nulcers with callous margins must be cauterized or else cut away with\r\nthe knife. _Galen_[283] declares himself even more plainly in the\r\nsame sense: “But if the margins of the ulcer merely are discoloured\r\nand callous, they must be removed right to where the healthy flesh\r\nbegins. Supposing this condition to have extended more widely, then the\r\nquestion arises,—whether we ought to cut away all the diseased tissue,\r\nor prefer a more tedious method of cure. It is natural and necessary\r\nin this case to consult the inclination of the patient; for whereas\r\nsome prefer to avoid the knife and submit to a more tedious treatment,\r\nothers on the contrary are ready for anything, so long as they get\r\ncured.” The same procedure was adopted with ulcers of the genitals,\r\nespecially gangrenous ulcers, as is proved at once by the passage\r\nalready quoted on p. 176 of Vol. II above.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic, for whom the genital organs were an object of veneration,\r\nwas no doubt horrified, as the Turk is to this day,[284] at the idea\r\nof any such operation on himself; while the licentious Roman, who\r\nmust have dreaded its very probable result in the entire loss of the\r\nfurther use and enjoyment of the parts in question,[285] sought any\r\nother means for choice, preferred to have recourse to Priapus or even\r\nresorted to suicide, like the _Municeps_ of Pliny mentioned on p. 257,\r\nbefore he trusted himself to the physicians who ever since the Carnifex\r\n(Butcher) Archagathus had appeared at Rome, strove to rival one another\r\nin infatuation for cautery and amputation. In any case it was only the\r\ndirest necessity[286] that drove the sufferer under such circumstances\r\nto the physician; while the latter had really and truly no reason for\r\nenquiring into the origin of the evil, as very often absolutely no\r\nalternative was left him but to grasp the knife or cauterizing iron. In\r\nthis way medical procedure could not but have fallen into disrepute,\r\nwhile physicians were in most instances necessarily deprived of all\r\nopportunity of systematic observation.\r\n\r\nWhether there were other factors as well to induce the old Physicians\r\nto apply the ordinary treatment of ulcers in general to those of the\r\ngenital organs, we cannot indeed as yet for the time being determine.\r\nCertainly the conjecture is an obvious one that they may well have\r\nhad an inkling of the specific nature of such ulcers, and that it\r\nwas not merely the local mischief they sought to put a stop to by\r\nearly application of cautery and knife. However it is only further\r\nand more careful investigations that must be allowed to decide the\r\npoint,—the more so, as the general _views as to the formation of\r\nulcers_ held by the Ancients seem in many respects to tell against it.\r\nThus _Galen_[287] says: “The mode in which these (ulcers involving\r\ndestruction of substance) are set up however is twofold; they arise\r\neither by removal of surrounding tissue (ἐκ περιαιρέσεως) or by eating\r\naway (ἐξ ἀναβρώσεως). How the former acts is well known. As to the\r\neating away, if it proceed from the inward parts of the organism, it\r\nis an outcome of the evil humours; but if it arise from outside, then\r\nit is a result of the physician’s remedial measures or of fire.” From\r\nthis we gather that all ulcers of the genitals, as well as others,\r\nwhich did not result from the action either of remedial measures or of\r\nfire, were held as being necessarily an outcome of the evil humours\r\nof the body. Further, that this view was not in any way peculiar\r\nto the time of Galen, but was a direct and necessary consequence\r\nof the further development of the pathology of “humours,” follows\r\nfrom the circumstance that we find the same opinion expressed by\r\n_Hippocrates_.[288] Again _Plato_ shared the latter author’s general\r\ndoctrine of _apostasis_ (suppurative inflammation taking off evil\r\nhumours) in his “Timaeus”, where he derives from the white phlegm,\r\nstriking outwards to the skin, cutaneous eruptions, rashes and the like\r\nmaladies, from the acrid, salty phlegm on the other hand the fluxes of\r\nall types, bearing different names according to the different parts of\r\nthe body affected.\r\n\r\nIf we do not choose to infer from this the proof of a then occurring,\r\ngenuine and consistent genesis of the affections peculiar to the\r\ngenitals, we are bound at any rate to admit that such a view must\r\nnecessarily have debarred all thought of any _specific_ character as\r\nbelonging to ulcers of these organs,—the more so as to this very day\r\nwe look in vain for any clear conception of really characteristic\r\nsymptoms marking out Venereal ulcers in particular. Further, the\r\nknowledge that ulcers of the genitals were contracted through sexual\r\nintercourse, lacked entirely, so far as the ancient Physicians were\r\nconcerned, the necessary confirmation and authority to induce them to\r\nmake a special and distinctive class of morbid process to include them,\r\nbecause as a rule they paid no sort of attention to the occasioning\r\ncause, unless in virtue of its being still present and active, or else\r\nby the necessity for its elimination, it could afford some indication\r\nfor therapeutic purposes. _Galen_ brings this out best and most\r\nclearly in the following passage:[289] “Moreover it will be a fitting\r\noccasion now to make it clear that not one of the causes directly\r\noccasioning the diathesis, or particular condition of body, will give\r\nany indication as to treatment; guiding signs for the purpose must\r\nrather be gathered from the complaint itself. What is to be done in\r\nany individual case depends on the immediate purpose and the nature of\r\nthe part attacked, on the predominant temperament and the like facts.\r\nFor to put it shortly, _in no case can an indication as to what is\r\nbeneficial be taken from any one of the factors that are no longer\r\nexistent_,—i. e. in actual operation. But as it often happens that in\r\norder to diagnose some affection that cannot be recognized either by\r\nhelp of ratiocination or by the senses, we are obliged to inquire into\r\nthe cause that occasioned it, laymen conclude the guiding signs for\r\nremedial treatment to be taken from the same source. But this is by\r\nno means so. This may be plainly seen in those instances where the\r\ndiathesis is quite well known in all its details; for whether it be\r\n_ecchymosis or ulceration or erysipelas or putrescent ulcer_ (σηπεδὼν)\r\n_or phlegmonous affection in any organ, it is perfectly useless to\r\ntrace out the cause that occasioned it_ (αἴτιον ποίησαν), _if this\r\nlatter is now no longer active_. On the other hand for any affection,\r\na clear insight into which is lacking, a knowledge of the occasioning\r\ncause is useful.”\r\n\r\nThis principle was equally applied to affections of the genitals, the\r\nantecedent act of coition being regarded as affording absolutely no\r\nhelp in diagnosis, as we see from the passage of _Galen_ to be next\r\ndiscussed. In this passage the declaration of a gonorrhœal patient to\r\nthe effect that the women with whom he had connection suffered no less\r\nthan himself from the malady, was entirely without influence on our\r\nauthor in the way of inducing him to assume and lay down a _specific_\r\ntype of gonorrhœa. Under these circumstances it is really a matter\r\nfor no surprise[290] that the old Physicians in discussing affections\r\nof the genitals never allege sexual intercourse as an occasioning\r\nfactor amongst others; and the conclusion drawn that such affections\r\nin Antiquity were not contracted by coition, _because_ the ancient\r\nWriters do not definitely and in every single instance assign this as\r\na cause, evidences really and truly merely the absence of any accurate\r\nstudy of their works and the knowledge of their views that is acquired\r\nas a result of such study. It is abundantly clear however that the\r\nneglect of the etiological factors referred to led eventually to their\r\nbeing completely overlooked; and it is no less obvious that this must\r\nneeds have been a source of manifold mistakes, which degraded the\r\nphysician in the eyes of the non-professional laity, very often made\r\nhim ridiculous by reason of this ignorance, and brought down, as we\r\nhave seen, many a cut of the satirist’s whip on his devoted shoulders.\r\nBut how many of our colleagues are there not at the present day whom\r\nVenereal disease involves in the same doubts and difficulties?\r\n\r\nHowever it may perhaps be suggested that, although the ancient\r\nPhysicians did not feel themselves obliged to make any mention of\r\nsexual intercourse as cause of affections of the genitals, they cannot\r\nfor all that have failed to notice the phænomena of infection. To say\r\nnothing of the fact that in no small proportion of instances affections\r\nof the genitals under the favouring conditions previously described\r\ndid not as a matter of fact arise through infection, but actually in\r\na sense spontaneously,[291] and further that to this day we possess\r\nabsolutely no criterion to distinguish such diseases arising in this\r\nway,—for it is only superficial and indolent observers that deny the\r\npossibility of such origination altogether,—apart from all this,\r\nthe view which the Ancients took as a whole of the general question\r\nof infection was one in the highest degree inadequate. For this\r\nstate of things, as _Heyne_[292] long ago pointed out, the τὸ θεῖον\r\n(the divine element), or in other words the prevalent opinion that\r\ninfectious diseases were an infliction of the offended deity, is mainly\r\nresponsible. In these very diseases of the genitals, we have in fact\r\nseen how they were ascribed to the wrath of Dionysus and Priapus; and\r\nhow long such ideas lasted, and how intimately they were interwoven\r\nwith the life of the people, may be gauged by the circumstance that\r\neven the Christian Fathers themselves took every pains and used every\r\neffort to maintain them.\r\n\r\nNow is it really in any way reasonable to expect the physicians of\r\nthose times to have so completely extricated themselves from the\r\npredominant range of ideas? and have we any right to abuse them for\r\ntheir beliefs at the present moment, when in our own day there are to\r\nbe found not a few physicians who deny absolutely the contagiousness of\r\nVenereal disease under its different forms? All the old practitioners\r\ncould do was to draw attention to the fact that underlying the τὸ θεῖον\r\nthere lurked some natural cause, and this view Hippocrates did actually\r\nmaintain in his writings. As to the indicative signs of this cause\r\nperceptible by the senses, as to the material substance, whatever it\r\nmay be, that communicates infection, into all this they could hardly\r\nbe expected to initiate investigations,[293] deficient as they were in\r\nevery sort of aid and assistance for the task. For I ask, have we, in\r\nspite of all our researches, thus far attained to any satisfactory and\r\ncertain results? Could the Anti-Contagionists ever have come forward\r\nat all, if we had been successful in demonstrating the contagion to be\r\nperceptible to the senses?\r\n\r\nBesides all this, we actually find to the present day that in the\r\ncountries in question the contagion exhibits but a low degree of\r\nvirulence, and only under epidemic influence, as at the epoch of the\r\nAthenian Plague, did it assume a virulent character at all,—a fact\r\nthat will be made yet clearer in our Continuation of the History of\r\nVenereal Disease. But wherever the contagion did exhibit this virulence\r\nof character, the ulcers that were set up passed over as a rule into\r\ngangrenous mortification, or else the physicians either exterminated\r\nit altogether by the actual cautery or removed it along with the part\r\nin which it had established itself. Thus any further spread of the\r\ncontagion in its original form was not to be expected, as in patients\r\nof the sort there can be no doubt all desire for coition must have been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nIf we now bring together the results of our discussion so far, we\r\nshall find reason to believe that, speaking generally, the ancient\r\nphysicians,—that is physicians properly so called,—possessed but scanty\r\nopportunities, especially in the case of women,[294] of observing\r\nwith any precision the origin and course of affections of the genital\r\norgans, for it was mostly only the malignant forms of these that came\r\nunder their notice, and these were of their very nature, except when\r\nepidemic conditions were at work, necessarily of infrequent occurrence.\r\nTheir pathological views stood in the way of unprejudiced observation,\r\n_conspicuous_ characteristic symptoms were as little to be found\r\nthen as they are nowadays, any adequate knowledge of the material\r\n_substrata_ of contagions was lacking to them in these as in other\r\nforms of disease, and thus they felt no direct inducement to class the\r\n_primary_ affections of the genitals as forming a special category of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThen again with regard to the _secondary_ symptoms, the ancient\r\npractitioners in the cases treated by them made the occurrence of such\r\nall but impossible, for scalpel and cauterizing iron either entirely\r\neradicated the contagion along with its material _substratum_, or\r\nelse removed it with all speed before it could be reabsorbed into the\r\nsystem. Even when these did nevertheless appear, in some instances too\r\ngreat an interval of time intervened, in others the parts attacked\r\nwere too remote from the spot primarily affected for it to have been\r\npossible for them to be referred to any direct inter-communication.\r\nIndeed this was made an actual impossibility in most cases, as it\r\nwas just those very spots that are the usual seat of the secondary\r\naffections which were attacked primarily in consequence of the\r\ndifferent modes of _Venus illegitima_ (abnormal love) with such extreme\r\nfrequency as to make it barely practicable for the keenest eye at a\r\ndiagnosis to discover any actual distinction between the two,—and\r\nthis without taking into account the circumstance that in view of the\r\npronounced tendency conditioned by climatic causes for the morbid\r\nprocess to strike outwards to the external skin, mischief in the mucous\r\nmembranes and bones must necessarily have fallen to a considerable\r\nextent into the background.\r\n\r\nIf circumstances put it out of the power of the ancient Physicians to\r\nunite under one whole the separate forms of Venereal disease, to look\r\nat the morbid process in its entirety, it is no less self-evident that\r\nfor the same reasons they could have found no occasion to invent a\r\n_special name_ for a thing that was simply invisible to them. Hence\r\nthe conclusion drawn that, because no such special name is found,\r\n_therefore_ Venereal disease cannot have existed, strictly speaking\r\nrequires no further consideration. Still, granting for the sake of\r\nargument that they had recognized at any rate the generic difference\r\nof the primary affections, were they therefore bound to introduce\r\na special name for them? _Galen_ shall supply the answer. He says,\r\nmentioning[295] that the old Physicians possessed no special name for\r\ndepression of the skull in conjunction with fissure of the bone: “It\r\nis better to give a clear description than to fall back miserably on\r\nbarbarous names, which the younger physicians have invented in great\r\nplenty.” In another place[296] he finds fault with the different\r\ndesignations given to ulcers, and then proceeds: “If I consented to\r\nenumerate all the names, I should be running the risk of deliberately\r\nteaching what I recommend others to avoid, when I say that the true\r\nsearcher after truth must needs withdraw his attention from the\r\nnomenclature that has grown up, and fix his eyes on the actual fact.”\r\n\r\nWhile these expressions of opinion demonstrate the uselessness of the\r\nnames, they show at the same time that no inconsiderable number of\r\nsuch names must no doubt have been in existence. So far as affections\r\nof the genitals are concerned, not only is this indicated by the Greek\r\nφθινὰς,—wasting disease and the Latin _robigo_,—ulcerous sore, not\r\nto mention the ambiguous ἄνθραξ,—carbuncle, malignant pustule, but\r\n_Celsus_ expressly declares the fact, saying (Bk. VI ch. 18) at the\r\nbeginning of his description of Diseases of the sexual parts: “Proxima\r\nsunt ea, quae ad partes obscoenas pertinent, quarum apud Graecos\r\nvocabula et tolerabilius se habent et accepta iam usu sunt, cum omni\r\nfere medicorum volumine atque sermone iactentur, apud nos foediora\r\nverba, ne consuetudine quidem aliqua verecundius loquentium commendata\r\nsunt.” (Next come such words as apply to the parts of shame, the Greek\r\nnames for which are at once less offensive and are now sanctioned by\r\nusage, as they are constantly occurring in every medical book and\r\nmedical discussion, whereas our native (Latin) names are coarser and\r\nare not even recommended by any custom on the part of those who speak\r\nwith some regard to modesty). Celsus himself communicates but few\r\nof these words, for he wrote _simul et pudorem et artis praecepta\r\nservans_, (observing at once the laws of modesty and the rules of his\r\nart); while between him and the writers of the Hippocratic school\r\nmedical Literature is all but a blank to us. The same is the case\r\nbetween _Celsus_ and _Galen_; and of a period so important for our\r\npurpose as that of the licentious Emperors, likewise not a single\r\nindependent medical Writer has come down to us. In fact even the\r\nFragments of the Compiler Oribasius, lately made known to the world by\r\nMai, contain, alas! nothing more than the headings of the Chapters most\r\ninteresting to us.\r\n\r\nIn such a condition of things it is really verging on the borders\r\nof folly to hope to give a dogmatic and decisive judgement as to\r\nthe knowledge of Venereal disease possessed by the Physicians of\r\nAntiquity,—the more so as the extant medical Works have never once\r\nbeen adequately ransacked, as _Naumann_ only the other day proved in\r\nthe case of _Galen_. But of a surety it is easier to maintain the\r\nAncients knew nothing of Venereal disease, than to devote the best part\r\nof a man’s life-time to the investigation, how much the Ancients did\r\nactually know about it!\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 40.\r\n\r\nIf we turn now from these discussions to the statements of the ancient\r\nPhysicians themselves, there are two different ways in which we may\r\nregard them ourselves and present them to the reader’s eyes. _Either_\r\nwe put down consecutively everything that has been said by one and the\r\nsame Author and examine each single datum we owe to him by itself, _or_\r\nwe bring together the data given by different writers on one and the\r\nsame subject, and then compare these one with another. The first way,\r\nthe one generally followed by historians of Venereal disease hitherto,\r\ngives us it is true the general results of the knowledge possessed by\r\nthe several writers on the different forms of Venereal disease; but,\r\nseeing on the one hand we do not in most instances actually possess\r\nall the works of our Author, while on the other even when we do, we\r\nare not justified in looking upon his report as embodying a _résumé_\r\nof all the knowledge of his time, the advantages of such a way of\r\ndealing with the subject are on the whole but slight, while it has the\r\n_dis_advantage of rendering considerably more difficult the general\r\nsurvey of the information possessed by Antiquity as to Venereal\r\ndisease, which nevertheless is really our immediate and capital\r\nconcern, and cannot fail moreover to occasion a host of contradictions.\r\n\r\nThe second way not only relieves us from this disadvantage, but also\r\nensures us that general Survey which is peculiarly necessary, and to\r\nthe absence of which the circumstance is chiefly to be ascribed that it\r\nhas been possible hitherto to convince the opponents of the antiquity\r\nof Venereal disease only in the most incomplete manner of its actual\r\nexistence in those times at all, as the exposition of the contrary\r\nview, in itself incomplete, was bound in its fragmentary presentment\r\nto seem even more incomplete still. Of course, in following the second\r\nway of exposition, there is an unavoidable dislocation of the data\r\ncommunicated by each individual writer, but this is a thing of but\r\nlittle moment, more particularly as its inconvenience is minimised by\r\nour giving the passages, when quoted for the first time, _in extenso_,\r\nso as to have on subsequent occasions merely to refer back to them.\r\nAgain the want of a clear marking of dates, a point undoubtedly of\r\ngreat importance in historical researches, is readily obviated by our\r\nlaying down the available fixed points of our chronology in the general\r\nSurvey that forms a necessary conclusion to our exposition.\r\n\r\nNo doubt _Hensler_ and _Alex. Simon_ had already struck out this second\r\nway of exposition; but the latter writer merely examined the data of\r\nthe several Writers by themselves without making any effort to build\r\nthem up into one whole. To do this was, it is true, a proceeding\r\nquite foreign to the method adopted by the Ancients, but for our own\r\ntime, accustomed as we now are to demand a systematic exposition of a\r\nsubject, it seems absolutely indispensible. _Hensler_ on the other hand\r\nin his treatment of the question fixed his particular attention solely\r\non the Middle Ages, and made it his immediate aim merely to prove that\r\npreviously to the ninetieth year of the XVth Century local affections\r\nof the genital organs were already well known, and had been subjected\r\nto treatment.[297]\r\n\r\nNow with regard to the actual exposition that follows, we shall refrain\r\nin it as much as possible from going into particulars, such as the text\r\nitself or the views of the Authors might seem to make obligatory, as\r\nthe needful space fails us, at any rate for the present. Moreover the\r\nmatter coming under review has been discussed already by many others,\r\nwhile as for critical elucidations, let them be as pressingly required\r\nas they may, we lack all the necessary _apparatus criticus_. In fact in\r\nthe case of several Writers, the translation, let alone the original\r\ntext, was with difficulty accessible, for which reason many a passage\r\nof those already known may perhaps have been passed by unregarded.\r\nA complete collection of all passages, including those still\r\nunknown,—for the harvest as was mentioned above has by no means been\r\nall reaped,—will certainly not be demanded by any reasonable reader\r\nfrom a Student of thirty, for hardly even a greybeard Enquirer surely\r\ncould boast of having read all printed works of the ancient Physicians.\r\nFor the rest, our present object is not at all to give an exhaustive\r\nexposition of all the ideas and observations of ancient Physicians as\r\nto affections of the genital organs; it only concerns us here to bring\r\ntogether what is true and directly available for our task. Under this\r\nhead would certainly seem to come the following seven points:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Gonorrhœa= (_Clap_).\r\n\r\n Nimia profusio seminis,—excessive flow of seed (Celsus), γονόῤῥοια.\r\n\r\nGonorrhœa, the name of which is compounded of γονή (badly made semen)\r\nand ῥεῖν (to flow),[298] consists in an affection of the seminal\r\nvessels, not of the private parts themselves, which merely serve as the\r\nroad for the excretion of the seed.[299] _Two kinds_ of gonorrhœa must\r\nbe distinguished, according as the malady is, or is not, combined with\r\nerection of the penis.[300]\r\n\r\n_Gonorrhœa with erection of the penis_ is called sometimes _Satyriasis_\r\nor _Satyriasmus_ sometimes _Priapism_,[301] and is a species of\r\ncramp,[302] which however only attacks the penis, belongs to the\r\ncategory of the emphysemata, or inflations,[303] and is conditioned\r\nby an afflux of the humours, particularly of conspissated or badly\r\ncompounded humours.[304] However this last phænomenon is only a\r\nsymptom of that morbid lasciviousness which _Paulus Aegineta_ entitles\r\nPriapism, while he designates the condition connected with it by\r\nthe name of Satyriasis, this having its origin in an inflammatory\r\naffection of the seminal vessels.[305] No proof is needed that both\r\nthese views are right so far as this, that gonorrhœa is both spasmodic\r\nand inflammatory, and in either case may be accompanied by priapism.\r\nNothing, or only very little, is evacuated of a nature to make the\r\npatients experience relief; and if there is, they are again attacked\r\nby the evil, until the original cause of the erection is eliminated,\r\non which the penis relaxes of itself and subsides.[306] According to\r\n_Paulus Aegineta_ paresis of the spermatic vessels,—the second form\r\nof gonorrhœa,[307]—supervenes, if the disease is not relieved, or\r\nelse general spasms. Patients attacked by such spasms succumb rapidly,\r\nsuffering from cold sweats and tympanitic distension of the abdomen.\r\n_Alexander of Tralles_ (IX. 10) saw the erection even continue after\r\nthe death of the patient. This form is not a common one; it occurs\r\npre-eminently among young people,[308] and according to _Themison’s_\r\nobservations, who frequently saw the complaint in Crete, where however\r\nit was probably very often a result of pederastia, is subject to\r\nepidemic influence.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ of this form of gonorrhœa demands according to\r\n_Paulus Aegineta_ (loco citato) immediate general blood-letting,—this\r\n_Galen_[309] also recommends, and practised with advantage,—local\r\ncupping or leeching, simple clysters, cooling and composing\r\nembrocations and poultices of solanum (nightshade) or cicuta (hemlock)\r\nin the lumbar region, of litharge, Cimolian earth, psymithium\r\n(white-lead) with vinegar, water or sweet wine, on the perineum.\r\nInternal remedies are a decoction of mallows, mercury and birch-bark,\r\nsap of rue, decoction from the root of the iris, nymphaea (water-lily)\r\nand adianthum (maidenhair). Diuretics are injurious. Patients should\r\nat the same time be put upon a low, vegetable diet, and the supine\r\nposture avoided. _Galen_ (loco citato) recommended in addition emetics,\r\nbut not purgatives, also embrocations of _ceratum rosaceum_, friction\r\nand subsequently gymnastic exercises. _Alexander of Tralles_ insists\r\nparticularly on the patient avoiding[310] all wanton scenes and\r\nthoughts, and forbids the use of any cold, specially astringent things,\r\nwhereby the resolution of the contraction is made more difficult (πάθος\r\nδυσδιαφόρητον γενέσθαι,—the affection is rendered hard to be resolved).\r\n\r\nGonorrhœa without erection of the penis, that is to say gonorrhœa\r\nproper, exhibits a persistent, involuntary discharge of the seed,[311]\r\nhas some analogy with _incontinentia urinae_, and usually depends\r\nlike the latter on weakness or failure in the retentive power of the\r\nspermatic vessels.[312] Very often an inflammatory stage supervenes,\r\nmaking the complaint approximate to the first form; patients secrete\r\ncopious and hot semen, which provokes them to ejaculation,—an\r\nejaculation however that is followed by great exhaustion. If they\r\navoid copulation, headache is established, pains in the stomach and\r\nnausea, while nocturnal pollutions cause them similar inconveniences\r\nto those they incur from coition. The ejaculation is accompanied by\r\nheat and smarting pain,—and this not solely among men but with women\r\nas well; for one of these patients, _Galen_ writes,[313] told me that\r\nnot only himself, but also _the women with whom he had accomplished\r\ncoition_, experienced during the discharge a biting, burning pain.\r\nOn the contrary, according to _Aretaeus_,[314] it would seem the\r\nonly symptoms found in conjunction with the complaint are itching\r\nof the privates, a voluptuous feeling and a violent inclination\r\nto sexual intercourse. This datum admits of ready explanation if\r\nwe consider the fact that in southern countries the inflammatory\r\nstage that makes its appearance is very brief and as a rule hardly\r\nnoticeable, provided,—though no doubt this condition was pretty often\r\nbroken,—coition was not indulged in during its course.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact in the great majority of instances the Physician\r\nhad only the chronic form to treat. Generally speaking a patient\r\nfirst notices the complaint, when the discharge begins; and then the\r\nlatter, when once the inflammatory stage is over, proceeds day and\r\nnight undisturbed and without special voluptuous feeling, without\r\nwanton dreams,[315] often without any particular sensation at all.\r\nThe actual discharge is a thin, cold, pale, sterile flux. Towards the\r\nend of the illness it becomes thicker, assumes an acrid quality, and\r\neventually ceases altogether to flow.[316] But if the malady persists,\r\nespecially in young people, then according to _Aretaeus_, the whole\r\nvisage of the sufferers assumes a greyish look; they grow sluggish,\r\natonic, spiritless, faint-hearted, indolent, dull, weak, emaciated,\r\nincapable of effort, unhealthy-looking,[317] pale, womanish, have\r\nno appetite, feel chilly, complain of heaviness in the limbs, are\r\nweak-loined, feeble and unfit for anything. According to _Galen_, the\r\nabdomen falls in, besides all the rest of the body collapsing more or\r\nless and withering; while patients become lean, of a yellowish pale\r\ncomplexion and hollow-eyed. In this way the complaint not unfrequently\r\npaves the road to paralysis, or else sufferers die of _tabes_ or\r\nwasting.[318] Specifically and in itself the disease is not dangerous,\r\nbut it provokes various other complaints, and represents a highly\r\ndisagreeable, ill-reputed affection (Aretaeus),[319] that almost\r\nalways follows a chronic course,[320]—for which reason Aretaeus and\r\nCaelius Aurelianus actually treat of it under the head of chronic\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nGonorrhœal pus is infectious, as is implied by the Mosaic Laws of\r\nPurification (Leviticus Ch. XV.), and the malady is communicated by\r\ncoition, as is seen from the words of _Galen_,—p. 428. But as early\r\nas the Fourth Century the idea was prevalent that the _conjunction of\r\nthe stars_ was not devoid of influence, as such or such a conjunction\r\nmight from a man’s very birth determine that _the individual was to\r\ndie of gonorrhœa_. This at any rate is maintained by _Julius Firmicus\r\nMaternus_,[321] who lived in the time of Constantine the Great.\r\nThe disease has to be carefully distinguished from the nocturnal\r\npollutions,[322] that are at times one of the sequelae of gonorrhœa.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is, according to _Aretaeus_, at the commencement that\r\nfor an ordinary rheum or flux, by keeping the parts affected cool,\r\nin order to counteract the flow of the humours to them; by degrees\r\ngoing on to a heating and at the same time desiccating procedure,\r\nthen the application of fresh wool to the part, the employment of\r\nfriction, embrocations of _ceratum rosaceum_ or _oinanthinum_ with\r\nwhite wine, olive oil with melilot, marjoram, rosemary, poultices of\r\nbarley-meal, saltpetre and dyll, but above all rue, with the addition\r\nof honey or, according to _Celsus_, vinegar; as further treatment,\r\nstimulating cataplasms, of a strength to redden the skin or even to\r\nbring out pustules on it, so as to draw off the afflux of the humours,\r\nor else as an alternative, plasters of the nature of the _emplastrum\r\nviride_ (green plaster), of _baccae lauri_ (laurel berries). As for\r\ninternal treatment, the patient should drink decoctions of: _semen\r\nlactucae_ (lettuce juice), _cannabis_ (hemp), _rad. orcheos_ (orchis\r\nroot), _nymphaeae_ (waterlily), _halicacabi_ (bladder-wort), etc.;\r\nand take _castoreum_ (beaver oil), or the antidotes of _Symphon_,\r\n_Philo_, or _Bestinus_, which are prepared from _viper’s flesh_.\r\nIn case of very profuse discharge, the patient should be directed\r\nto drink hard red wine; if he is acrid with bile (χολωδέστερον καὶ\r\nδριμύτερον,—over-bilious and acrid), lukewarm baths are brought into\r\nrequisition (Alexander of Tralles). On one point all authorities are\r\nagreed, that the main thing to depend on is diet. Both food and drink,\r\nsays Celsus, must be cold, a precaution Themison also recommended in\r\nsatyriasis, whereas Caelius Aurelianus denounces it. The patient must\r\nnot indulge in semen-forming matters, such as cause flatulency, but\r\ntake nourishing food, flesh of animals but not fish, a little light\r\nwine with it, for the constant ejaculation is weakening; he should be\r\ncareful as to resting,[323] lie on a cool bed, either on the right side\r\nor the left (Paulus Aegineta), not on the back (Celsus).\r\n\r\nWhere the complaint is of longer continuance, exercise in the open\r\nair and the use of cold baths is to be recommended, which latter\r\n_Celsus_[324] it appears prefers to see resorted to, as well as cold\r\naspersions, almost at the very commencement; a mode of treatment\r\nthat is even now coming into fashion again among ourselves, as the\r\nwater-cure mania makes further and further progress. _Galen_[325]\r\nrecommended, besides diet and medicine, that with a view to\r\nretarding the preparation of semen, gymnastic exercises, particularly\r\nsuch as bring the upper part of the body into activity, e. g.\r\nball-playing both with great and little balls and the casting of leaden\r\ndisks, be resorted to. After bathing, patients must rub and wash over\r\nthe hips with desiccative ointments, oil expressed from red, coarse\r\nolives, roses or quinces, wax-salves with the juices of _sempervivum_\r\n(evergreen house-leek), _solanum_ (nightshade), _umbilicus Veneris_\r\n(navelwort), _portulaca_ (purslain), linseed boiled in water, etc.\r\nI once saw, he says, the Intendant of a Gymnasium Athletes lay a\r\nleaden disk on the lumbar region of an athlete as a measure against\r\nnocturnal pollution,—a means _Caelius Aurelianus_ prescribed _also_ for\r\ngonorrhœal patients,—and afterwards recommended the same treatment to\r\nanother sufferer from these, who was thankful for the advice. Others\r\nagain found lying on the _agnus castus_ beneficial to them, as well as\r\nthe taking of its juice along with rue. Violently active refrigerants\r\nin the form of ointments, prepared from poppy and _atropa mandragora_\r\nshould not be employed, and this equally applies to sleeping on\r\nthese plants when they are in bloom, for they act injuriously on the\r\nkidneys. On the other hand sleeping on roses was advantageous,—Caelius\r\nAurelianus added to the list the leaves and flowers of _vitex_ (agnus\r\ncastus, Abraham’s balm). “Besides these I have excogitated many other\r\nspecifics for patients of the sort, and found their utility confirmed\r\nin practice. For instance those afflicted with such a condition of\r\nbody should pay particular attention to this. When the accumulation of\r\nsemen that has to be ejaculated is at its greatest, they should during\r\nthe day take a nourishing yet moderate meal, and then when they lie\r\ndown to sleep accomplish sexual intercourse.[326] But on the following\r\nday, after taking their fill of sleep, they should on rising chafe\r\nthemselves till the skin is reddened. Next they should rub the body all\r\nover with oil; then soon after take some well-leavened, pure bread,\r\nbaked in the baking-pan, and mixed with wine, after which they may then\r\ngo about their customary business. Between the rubbing with oil and the\r\nmeal of bread patients may go for a walk, if there is a spot convenient\r\nfor the purpose in the neighbourhood, _except in the colder time of the\r\nyear, for at that season it is better for them to stay indoors_.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to _gonorrhœa in women_, it is all but impossible to\r\narrive at any accurate knowledge of what the Ancient Physicians knew\r\nconcerning it. The reason of this is that the views held as to the\r\neffect of deteriorated menstrual blood and of the ῥοῦς γυναικεῖος\r\n(female discharge), by means of which the whole body was supposed\r\nto purge itself of evil humours,[327] absolutely precluded the\r\npossibility of any unprejudiced observation, in precisely the same\r\nway as down to quite modern times the _fluor albus_ (white flux,\r\nblennorrhœa) conditioned the extremely imperfect knowledge possessed by\r\nthe faculty of female gonorrhœa. We purpose to leave over the inquiry\r\ninto the points which differentiate the two (male and female gonorrhœa)\r\nto another opportunity; and will only note here that gonorrhœa in\r\nwomen, strictly so called, was by no means utterly unknown,—in fact\r\nthere is no doubt whatever as to its being distinguished from the ῥοῦς\r\nγυναικεῖος (female discharge), as is shown by the passage of _Galen_\r\nquoted above, and still more clearly by _Aretaeus_,[328] who speaks\r\nof γονόῤῥοια γυναικεῖα (female gonorrhœa) distinctly as ἄλλος ῥόος\r\nλευκὸς, another species of white flux. Whether perhaps this knowledge\r\nwas first accumulated at the epoch of Tiberius and his fellows cannot\r\nindeed be positively determined; but certainly the word ἐλέξαμεν (we\r\nhave named it) of the text of Aretaeus may very well leave room for\r\nsuch a conjecture, and as a matter of fact Aretaeus would appear\r\nto have lived under Domitian, and was therefore a contemporary of\r\nMartial’s!\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Ulcers and Caruncles in the Urethra.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen from Hippocrates, Celsus and Galen that the\r\nancient Physicians had observed the inflammation and subsequent\r\nmatteration of the small mucous glands of the urethra evidenced by the\r\nsymptoms of painful micturition, and seeing that mere tenesmus, as\r\nwell as dysentery, are denominated ἑλκώσις (ulceration) by them, it is\r\nby no means improbable that many a urethral ulcer and many a case of\r\ngonorrhœa may have been treated under the name of ischuria (retention\r\nof urine). This is the more likely, as we learn from a passage of\r\n_Celsus_[329], one usually misinterpreted in several respects, that\r\nthe urethral discharge was explained as due to an extension of\r\nthe ulcer to the spermatic cords (_vasa deferentia_,—seed-bringing\r\nvessels). Yet further confirmation is afforded by a passage of\r\n_Actuarius_,[330] already cited by Simon, and our own conjecture\r\nexpressed on a previous page thus justified.\r\n\r\nUlcers however also occurred in the urethra[331] unconnected with\r\ntubercular swellings (ἀφανὲς ἕλκος,—invisible ulcer); these not\r\nunfrequently occasioned bleeding,[332] and made their presence known\r\nby the accompanying pain, while synchronously small irregularly-shaped\r\nparticles (ἐφελκύδες) were ejected.[333] The appropriate treatment of\r\nthese ulcers has been described by _Paulus Aegineta_ (loco citato);\r\nit consisted in injections of honey and milk (_Aëtius_, IV. 2. 19.,\r\nand _Actuarius_ also recommended _enemata morsus expertia_,—clysters\r\nfree from biting acridity), introduction of lotus pounded in a leaden\r\nmortar by means of a feather or a twisted piece of lint (λεπτὸν\r\nστρεπτὸν,—light material twisted,—an anticipation of the bougie?)\r\nalong with a mixture of gall-apple, flowers of zinc (oxide of zinc),\r\nstarch-flour and aloes smeared in equal parts with rose-sap and\r\nplantain-sap.\r\n\r\nNot unfrequently such ulcers give rise to the establishment of\r\n_caruncles in the urethra_, particularly _in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe neck of the bladder_, though they occur[334] also in the ear,\r\nnose, as well as in connection with the privates and anus, in the\r\nlatter case presenting the symptoms of ischuria (retention of urine),\r\ninterfering as they do with the outflow of the urine. The presence of\r\nthese caruncles may be diagnosed by the preceding symptoms, as also\r\nby the circumstance that the urine is evacuated by the introduction\r\nof a _catheter_, that this occasions pain at the seat of ulceration\r\nand breaks through the caruncle, causing the urine to pass mixed\r\nwith blood and the remains of the caruncle. It is necessary to know\r\nif a thrombus (blood-clot) or calculus blocks the urethra; but as\r\nto whether we pronounce the mischief to be situated in the urethra\r\nitself and the cause of the ischuria to be there as well, this is a\r\ndistinction of no practical or scientific value.[335] For as a rule\r\nit was solely as being the excretory duct of the bladder that the\r\nurethra had some little attention directed to it; while any signs\r\nit exhibited were generally regarded simply as symptoms connected\r\nwith the urinary bladder and the kidneys. Partial _growing up, or\r\nmorbid extuberance, in the urethra_ (συσσάρκωσις,—a growing together)\r\nfollowing on a previous ulceration is described by _Heliodorus_, as\r\ngiven in Oribasius,[336] occasioning either a narrowing of the urethral\r\npassage in one spot or its being filled up over its entire superficies\r\nwith morbid outgrowths of tissue. Partial narrowing causes dysuria or\r\nstrangury (difficulty of micturition), the narrowing of the whole canal\r\nby morbid outgrowths, ischuria (impossibility of micturition, retention\r\nof urine). The outgrowth must be removed by means of a small lancet.\r\nThe mode of procedure is then as follows. The patient is placed on his\r\nback, the penis straight out; then with the fingers of the left hand\r\nthe operator compresses it behind the spot where the growth is found,\r\nin order to prevent the blood from flowing inwards when the incision\r\nis made; next he takes the knife in the right hand, pushes the point\r\ninto the urethra, divides it as far along as the base of the morbid\r\ngrowth, but not so as to go beyond it. This done, he proceeds to cut\r\nout the growth by means of a circular incision, and compresses the\r\nurethra between the fingers, causing the growth to spring forwards.\r\nSupposing it now projects but does not actually spring out, it is\r\nextracted by means of a _mydion_ (boat-shaped instrument). After the\r\nremoval of the growth the urethra must be protected from contact with\r\nthe urine, which during the first few days is best done by applying an\r\n_ipoterion_, or compress,[337] made of papyrus. The mode of preparing\r\nthis is described in detail later on, and a sort of elastic catheter\r\nindicated. Catheters of copper and tin might also be used, or a\r\nquill taken for the purpose. The tin or lead catheters are not to be\r\ninserted till after the third day, and carry in front a projecting\r\nshield. The application of a bandage described is declared to be of\r\ngreat advantage. Scirrhosities of _the neck of the bladder_, abscesses\r\nand the like, are mentioned by _Galen_ (loco citato) as occurring\r\noccasionally. With regard to _diseases of the prostates_ subsequent\r\ninvestigations must authenticate the amount of knowledge possessed of\r\nthese by the physicians of Antiquity.\r\n\r\n_Inflammation of the testicles_[338] is usually characterized according\r\nto _Paulus Aegineta_[339] by pain under strong pressure by the fingers,\r\nwhile only a slight pressure causes no uneasiness. Redness and heat\r\nare slight externally, but the latter is perceptible deep in by an\r\ninvestigating finger. Sometimes fever is associated with it, and if\r\nthe inflammation is not quickly combated, the pain, _Celsus_ tells\r\nus,[340] extends to the inguinal and lumbar regions, the parts swell,\r\nthe spermatic cord grows thicker and at the same time indurated. Both\r\nauthorities make the treatment consist at first in blood-letting at the\r\nankle,[341] and the use of soft poultices of bean-meal,[342] pounded\r\ncumin, linseed, etc. to which in cases of induration is added later on\r\na mixture of crocus and wine. In obstinate instances poultices are used\r\nof _rad. cucumeris agrestis_ (root of the wild cucumber);[343] _Paulus\r\nAegineta_ under these circumstances prescribes grapes, peas, cumin,\r\nbrimstone, nitre and resin, made into a cataplasm with honey, besides\r\nsundry wax-salves. A considerable list of remedial agents is found\r\nenumerated in _Marcellus_ (ch. 33.) intended to combat the _tumores et\r\ndolores testiculorum_ (swellings and pains in the testicles); of these\r\nwe will only mention the salves of mutton-suet and nitre, the sea-water\r\ncompresses, the poultices of _rad. cicutae_ (hemlock root), white of\r\negg, frankincense and ceruse (white lead). _Aretaeus_[344] gives us\r\nan interesting piece of information to the effect that in order to\r\ncounteract neuralgia of the testicles and spermatic cord, accompanied\r\nat the same time by intestinal colic, the spermatic cord was _cut\r\nout_, being looked upon as the cause of the suffering. Important too\r\nis the case related by _Hippocrates_,[345] where a patient at Athens\r\nsuffered from _prurigo_ (itch) of the whole body, but above all of the\r\n_testicles_ and the forehead, his skin having grown thick and hard as\r\nit does in leprosy, so that nowhere could it be pulled up above the\r\ngeneral surface.\r\n\r\n_Induration_ of the testicles is mentioned by _Galen_,[346] who assigns\r\nit as one cause of sterility. The same author[347] likewise speaks of\r\nthe testicles being affected with _aphthae_ (διδύμους ἀφθῶντας), which\r\nhe says should be treated with _terra cimolia_ (Cimolian chalk) and\r\nmyrtle-berries.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Ulcers of the Genitals.\r\n\r\n φθινάς, ἄνθραξ, ἔσχαρα,—robigo, cancer. (Wasting ulcer, malignant\r\n pustule, scab,—ulcerous sore, eating, suppurating ulcer).\r\n\r\nThough we cannot exactly subscribe to Alexander Simon’s declaration\r\nto the effect that it would fill whole volumes, if we wished to cite\r\nsystematically and in full all that has been said by the oldest\r\nand earlier medical Writers on ulcerous affections that attack the\r\nsexual parts from the points of view of pathology and therapeutics,\r\nstill the number of such passages is no doubt sufficiently imposing.\r\nUnfortunately their contents cannot be described as equally important;\r\nfor the pathological side is sacrificed to the therapeutic,—in fact the\r\ngreat majority give nothing more than the general names ἕλκος (ulcer)\r\nor φλεγμονὴ αἰδοίου (inflamed tumour of the privates), and then at\r\nonce pass on to discuss the remedial measures expedient. This mode\r\nof procedure is indeed quite consistent with the general character\r\nof medical science in those days, for it is always the case that the\r\nmore medicine declines, the more practitioners think themselves bound\r\nto look for remedial means nowhere but in the prescription-books.\r\nCuriously enough we find that almost every thing given by the later\r\nphysicians already has a place in the pages of _Celsus_; the latter\r\nprobably utilized the Alexandrian physicians, on whose knowledge the\r\nlater Writers appear to have made little advance.\r\n\r\nNow with regard to ulcers of the genitals in general,—these are of\r\nfrequent occurrence, as to begin with the parts are from their very\r\nconstitution prone to putrefactive changes, as well owing to their\r\nmoist nature, possessing as they do so many glands that draw moisture\r\ntogether, and being covered with hair, as because they are at the\r\nsame time excretory organs[348]. The time of year exerts an influence\r\non the appearance of such ulcers, for they show themselves chiefly\r\nin the summer,[349] particularly when a South wind is blowing,[350]\r\na wind that is moist and warm and fosters a tendency towards the\r\nresolution of fluid and solid parts alike. Thus ulcers of the genitals\r\nare likewise subject to epidemic influence, as has been clearly\r\ndemonstrated on previous pages. They are acquired by coition, and\r\nthat equally by natural coition, as the instance of Hero mentioned on\r\na previous page shows without a shadow of doubt, as by the unnatural\r\nforms, and particularly by paederastia, which last caused the malady\r\nof Naevolus’ slave also referred to in an earlier passage. Moreover in\r\nthe hot regions of Asia and Africa want of cleanliness also, especially\r\nwhen men were uncircumcised, gave occasion, as in Apion’s case, to\r\nthe establishment of ulcers of the genitals. These were looked upon\r\nby the Ancient physicians in most instances as an outcome of the evil\r\nhumours of the body,—an opinion which need cause us less surprise as\r\neven in much more modern times a large number of physicians have\r\nendeavoured to explain the origin of chancres by an antecedent general\r\ninfection, that manifested itself in this way, viz. by the appearance\r\nof these sores. Ulcers not unfrequently took the form of aphthae,\r\nparticularly in women,[351] being in that case more superficial,\r\nbut for that very reason readily eating their way over adjacent\r\nparts,—(_cancer_, eating ulcer). In many instances inflammation\r\n(φλεγμονὴ, ἐρυσίπελας—phlegmonous inflammation, erysipelas) and\r\nswelling of the parts affected were accompanying circumstances. They\r\nwere often painful,—sometimes moist, sometimes dry. In the majority of\r\ncases they assumed under favouring conditions a putrefactive character\r\n(φαγέδαινα,—phagedenic or eating ulcer), under which circumstances\r\nworms actually bred in the sores, or else they manifested from the\r\nvery first a marked tendency to pass over into gangrene (ἄνθραξ,\r\n_carbunculus_,—malignant pustule, carbuncle), where as a rule merely an\r\nulcer developing from a minute bladder (bleb) or φύμα existed in the\r\nfirst instance. On the other hand its course was often very chronic,\r\nwithout phlegmonous ulcers at all, or if these were present, either\r\nthey were callous, or else condylomatous outgrowths sprung from them.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these varying factors did the _treatment of ulcers\r\nof the genitals_ vary, though without any universally recognized\r\nspecial distinction from that adopted for ulcers in general.\r\nSpeaking generally, purgings by the rectum are not indicated; but\r\npreferably in affections of the genitals revulsory treatment by\r\nemetics is employed.[352] If blood-letting is resorted to, it must\r\nbe either in the hollow of the knee or at the ankle.[353] As to local\r\nmeasures, fatty matters according to _Antyllus_ are not good for the\r\ngenitals,[354] whereas astringents and desiccatives are beneficial,\r\nif that is to say the phlegmonous condition is absent.[355] On the\r\ncontrary if the latter is found, this must in the first place be\r\ncombated, then a mixture applied consisting of sifted resin and\r\npounded cumin, or alternatively a poultice of barley-meal, hydromel\r\nand vine-leaves reduced to a pulp, or else cumin with butter and\r\ntree-resin.[356] Above all Galen[357] recommended in the early stages\r\nbefore the appearance of an eating or phagedenic ulcer (κατὰ τῶν ἐν\r\nαἰδοίοις φλεγμονῶν ἐν ἀρχῇ, πρὶν ὑποφαίνεσθαι τινα νομώδη σηπέδονα,—in\r\nphlegmonous affections of the privates at the commencement, before any\r\neating ulceration appear) a _ceratum rosaceum_ (wax-salve of roses),\r\nthe preparation of which he gives _in extenso_, and Aëtius copying\r\nfrom him; its activity is enhanced by the addition of a little _oleum\r\nsabinum_ (Sabine oil). If the ulcers are complicated with _swelling_,\r\na compound of white-lead (ψιμύθιον) and triturated vine-leaves is\r\napplied,[358] sea-water compresses,[359] or poultices of boiled lentils\r\nand pomegranate rind.[360] For _painful_ ulcers pompholyx (flowers of\r\nzinc)[361] was particularly recommended, or a decoction of linseed\r\nwith the addition of myrrh; also woman’s milk may be advantageously\r\nused as well,[362] especially with the addition of _anodynes_, and\r\nabove all pompholyx or flowers of zinc. _Paulus Aegineta_ (loco citato)\r\nprescribed the application of butter and resin melted together in\r\nequal parts, or linseed ground up with myrrh and resin. In _raw_ and\r\n_dry_ ulcers of the genitals the aloe was very generally prescribed;\r\nit was powdered and sprinkled over the sore,[363] or if a phlegmonous\r\ncondition was already established, dissolved in water.[364] In the\r\nsecond case _Oribasius_[365] prescribed likewise the use of lead,—and\r\nindeed it was a usual recommendation with regard to most of the\r\nrecognized remedies that they should be pounded and triturated in\r\nleaden mortars with leaden pestles.\r\n\r\nSuperficial ulcers _of an aphthae-like character_ were treated as early\r\nas in _Hippocrates’_ time and indeed by him[366] with a decoction of\r\nmyrtle-berries boiled in wine. As a remedy against _moist_ ulcers a\r\ncertain mixture of Crito’s, compounded of frankincense and myrrh boiled\r\nin sweet wine, had a great reputation;[367] but above all the powder\r\nof _charta usta_ (papyrus ash), anise and _cucurbita_ (gourd)[368]\r\nwas employed, after the ulcer had been washed with urine; further the\r\n_cortex pinus_ (cork-tree), _lapis haematites_ (bloodstone, haematite\r\niron-ore),[369] to which frankincense was added in the case of more\r\ndeep-seated ulcers,[370] also _cadmium ustum_ (burnt calamine) (Paulus\r\nAegineta); likewise washing with urine proved beneficial.[371] In\r\n_spreading or eating_ ulcers (νομῶδες ἕλκος) a poultice was applied\r\nof lentils, pomegranates and oxymel[372] reduced to a pulp; but a\r\nstill more usual remedy was to sprinkle verdigris over the sore,[373]\r\nand especially verdigris in conjunction with a salve made of\r\n_charta usta_ (papyrus ash), sulphur, lead-slag, honey and _ceratum\r\nrosaceum_ (wax-salve of roses); another remedy highly thought of was\r\nthe _pastillus corax_ (corax cake), the ingredients of which were\r\nverdigris, chalk, gallnut, frankincense, turpentine, wax, oil of\r\nmyrtles and beef-tallow; this was particularly beneficial in combating\r\nthe carbunculous form of the disease. Very often however recourse to\r\nthe cauterizing iron and the knife was unavoidable, especially if\r\ngangrene supervened, or if the callosity of the edges of the ulcer made\r\ncicatrisation impossible.\r\n\r\nSuch were the general methods of treatment employed for ulcers of the\r\ngenital organs, but these naturally varied according to the various\r\ndistinctions between the several sorts conditional on the situation of\r\nthe sore. Thus it becomes our next business to indicate on what parts\r\nof the body ulcers were observed:—\r\n\r\n\r\nA. ULCERS ON THE MALE GENITAL ORGANS.\r\n\r\nIt is invariably the case that forms of ulceration affecting the male\r\ngenitals are the most familiar and best known, and this was equally\r\ntrue in Antiquity. Whatever information the Ancient physicians deemed\r\nit necessary to record on the subject is found as early as _Celsus_\r\nlaid down with something approaching to completeness in his writings\r\n(VI. 18.).\r\n\r\n\r\na. _Ulcers of the Prepuce._\r\n\r\nAccording to Leonidas[374] fissures and cracks in the prepuce\r\nfrequently occurred, in all cases of the latter being too tight and\r\nbeing forcibly drawn back. On these supervened pain and phlegmonous\r\ninflammation; and then if a cure were not speedily effected, the\r\nedges assumed a condition of callosity, necessitating the use of the\r\nknife for its removal. However, more often than not the wound broke\r\nout again, because as was noted as early as by _Hippocrates_,[375]\r\nwounds of the prepuce are as a rule obstinate in healing. To meet this\r\neventuality _Galen_[376] provides an entirely suitable procedure. While\r\nulcers of the glans penis demand desiccative remedies, those of the\r\nprepuce rather call for _epilotics_,[377] especially anise. Supposing\r\nthe prepuce to become gangrenous, it must be cut away circularly,\r\nand the bleeding stopped by cauterization; if this treatment is not\r\nneedful, a mixture of verdigris with honey, or pomegranate and vetch is\r\napplied.[378] Ulcers on the inner fold of the prepuce, as also on the\r\nskin of the penis generally, are mentioned by _Celsus_ (VI. 18.), the\r\nlatter likewise by _Galen_.[379] Such ulcers on the inner fold of the\r\nprepuce, Celsus states, not unfrequently give occasion to the setting\r\nup of phimosis and paraphimosis; and yet another consequence, a morbid\r\ngrowing together of glans and prepuce was observed by _Oribasius_ (loco\r\ncitato, 5.) and _Paulus Aegineta_ (VI. 56.), for which these authors\r\nprescribe appropriate medical and surgical treatment. Under the name of\r\n_cancer_ (eating ulcer) of the prepuce Celsus, it would seem, describes\r\nthe νομὴ (spreading ulcer) of the Greek physicians, which commences by\r\nthe ulcer turning black. Occasionally too the ulcers developed out of\r\nthemselves morbid growths, excrescences or condylomata, particularly\r\nthe form known as _thymion_ (warty excrescence).\r\n\r\n\r\nb. _Ulcers of the Glans Penis._\r\n\r\nThese are, as pointed out by _Celsus_ (VI. 18.), best described by\r\ntaking their pathological and therapeutic aspects together; but it\r\nwould serve no useful purpose to quote once more in this place the\r\npassages dealing with this part of the subject, which have been so\r\noften printed already. He makes a distinction, as does _Galen_,[380]\r\nbetween dry and clean, moist and suppurative, ulcers, the latter of\r\nwhich readily lead to phimosis and paraphimosis. The discharge is\r\nsometimes thin and watery, sometimes purulent, and on occasion becomes\r\nevil-smelling; the ulcerations both spread superficially and penetrate\r\ninwards, and may actually destroy the glans underneath the prepuce,\r\nso that it perishes altogether. When this happens, _Paulus Aegineta_\r\n(VI. 57.) has a leaden pipette inserted in the orifice of the urethra,\r\nto enable the patient to pass water. In other cases the prepuce grows\r\ninto one with the ulcerated glans penis (_Celsus_, _Paulus Aegineta_,\r\n_Oribasius_). Ulcers _circa coronam glandis_ (round the crown of the\r\nglans penis) are mentioned by _Aëtius_.[381]\r\n\r\nA special kind is the _cancer colis_ (eating ulcer of the member),\r\nprobably the same as the νομὴ (spreading ulcer) of the Greeks, which\r\nAëtius[382] delineates as a spreading, flaccid ulcer, which on pressure\r\nemits a thin bloody discharge, that subsequently becomes feculent.\r\nHemorrhage is apt to supervene according to Celsus on the shedding of\r\na cicatrix artificially produced by operation or the cauterizing iron.\r\nAnother species of _cancer_ is the φαγέδαινα (phagedenic, eating\r\nulcer) of the Greeks, which extends rapidly and penetrates to the\r\nbladder. It appears to be identical with ἄνθραξ (malignant pustule),\r\nthough Celsus mentions the _carbunculus colis_ (carbuncle of the\r\nmember) in a special category; for the description he gives, bk. V.\r\nch. 28., of carbuncle is equally applicable to the phagedaena.[383]\r\nἌνθραξ (malignant pustule) begins with itching, later on a pustule,\r\nor else a number of little bladders or blebs resembling millet-seeds\r\nappear, which burst in much the same way as a blister due to burning\r\ndoes, leaving behind an _ulcus crustaceum_ (scab-encrusted ulcer),\r\nresembling the cicatrix of a burn; this is firmly adherent and black\r\nin colour. The surrounding tissue is likewise black and violently\r\ninflamed, the inflammation not unfrequently having an erysipelas-like\r\ncharacter. _Galen_[384] designates the process ἀνθράκωσις, and declares\r\nthat buboes are an accompanying feature. He holds the ulcers of the\r\ngenitals occurring under the special climatic conditions laid down by\r\nHippocrates above to have been partly ἄνθραξ,[385] the disease to which\r\nHero succumbed.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of ulcer affecting the male genitals is mentioned by\r\n_Pollux_[386] under the name of θηρίωμα (malignant sore), which\r\n_Celsus_ (V. 28.) likewise speaks of, but without particularizing its\r\nsituation. The same fact applies to ulcers of the glans penis as to\r\nthose of the prepuce, viz. that many forms of morbid outgrowths arise\r\nfrom them; in other instances callosities on the edges of the ulcers\r\nare built up, leaving behind a callous protuberance, which the Greeks\r\nappear to have called ἥλος (a nail), the Romans _clavus_ (a nail).[387]\r\nThe proper treatment to be followed in each of these special cases is\r\ngiven by Celsus and the Writers he cites.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. ULCERS OF THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, as indeed in the discussion of the female genital\r\norgans generally, we once again meet with the difficulty due to the\r\nindefiniteness of the names given to the several parts. Not only do\r\nthe Greeks constantly make use of the general expression αἰδοία, μόρια\r\n(privates, parts), but they likewise employ ὑστέρον and μήτρα (the\r\nwomb) sometimes as meaning the vagina, sometimes the uterus, though\r\nit is true the later Writers like _Galen_[388] designate the vagina ἡ\r\nὑστέρα, the uterus ὁ ὑστέρος, yet without keeping consistently to the\r\ndistinction. The same applies to the use in Latin of _locus_ (place),\r\n_pars_ (part), and _vulva_ (womb), which last word stands for the\r\nuterus in _Celsus_, _Pliny_ and most of the later Writers.\r\n\r\nPassing over the indefinite expressions _dolores_ (pains),\r\n_inflammatio_ or _phlegmoné_ (inflammation) of the genitals, although\r\nthe treatment prescribed for them clearly implies that very often\r\nulceration was concurrently present, we find the various kinds of\r\nulcers of the female genitals most fully and systematically described\r\nby _Aretaeus_,[389] _Paulus Aegineta_ (III. 65-68.) and _Aëtius_[390]\r\nfollowing Archigenes, Soranus and Aspasia.[391][392]\r\n\r\n_Abscesses_ _Aëtius_ says (loco citato, ch. 110.) occur on the female\r\n_labia_; if these extend in the direction of the anus, they must not\r\nbe opened with the knife, as fistulas are liable to be set up, but\r\nthere is no fear of this when they extend towards the urethra. The\r\nsame author (p. 109.) speaks of _pustulae scabrae_ (scabrous, scurfy\r\npustules) in the vagina and orifice of the womb, which throw off\r\nbran-like scales, as also (ch. 108.) of _tubercula miliaria_ (miliary\r\ntubercles) in the same localities. These may no doubt be recognized\r\nby touch, but are better diagnosed by means of the uterine speculum,\r\nor _Dioptra_, and _ex coitus affrictu_ (in consequence of friction\r\nin coition) interfere with menstruation and conception. Obviously\r\nwhat is here pointed to is the swollen mucous glands, which in our\r\nmodern practice likewise are frequently observed in gonorrhœal cases.\r\nOften the ulcers take a form characterized by _fissures_ (ῥαγάδες,\r\n_fissurae_,—fissures, _rimae_,—cracks), particularly at the orifice of\r\nthe uterus.[393] Sometimes they become callous, at others give rise to\r\nmorbid outgrowths; as a rule the discharge is a thin watery juice, and\r\npain is felt during coition.[394]\r\n\r\nUlcers strictly so called, says Aretaeus, are either superficial, in\r\nfact rather excoriations than ulcers, and far-spreading; they itch\r\nas though salt had been sprinkled on the surface, give off a small\r\nquantity of thick pus, free from smell, and are not malignant. To this\r\nclass probably belong the aphthae-like ulcers of Hippocrates.[395] In\r\nother cases they are more deep-seated; being then painful, discharging\r\nan evil-smelling pus, and having a less mild character than the\r\nformer, but still not such as to be described as malignant. If they\r\npenetrate yet deeper, the edges then become rough, the discharge\r\ntakes the form of a malodorous juice, while the pain is more severe\r\nthan in the other kinds. The actual tissue of the womb is partially\r\ndestroyed in the latter case, while morbid outgrowths form, which make\r\ncicatrization extremely difficult. This last kind was known also as\r\n_phagedaena_, (eating ulcer); it is dangerous, especially if the pain\r\nincreases and the patient falls into low spirits. An offensive juice is\r\ndischarged, so foul that the patient herself is hard put to bear it;\r\nthe ulcer is highly intolerant of being touched for the application\r\nof remedial means; it may end fatally, and is known under the name\r\nof “Crab-ulcer”. Νομὴ (spreading ulcer),[396] carbuncle and _sordida\r\nulcera_ (foul ulcers) of the uterus are mentioned by _Aëtius_ (loco\r\ncitato), who shows the mode of investigating them by means of the\r\nuterine speculum and a treatment consisting mainly of injections[397]\r\nand pessaries prepared of a number of different remedies. Not\r\nunfrequently unskilful treatment of ulcers of the vagina occasioned\r\nmorbid outgrowths, which according to _Celsus’_ teaching,[398] must be\r\nremoved by surgical means. Lastly the fact that ulcers of the genital\r\norgans of women were prejudicial to men who consummated coition with\r\nthem and were for that reason dreaded by them, is clearly implied in\r\nthe narrative of _Cedrenus_.[399]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Ulcers of the Fundament.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how fissures and ulcers of the fundament were a\r\nnot unusual consequence of the vice of the pathic, yet not the faintest\r\nindication of the fact is to be found in the medical Writers. The\r\nknowledge possessed by the Ancients as to affections of the fundament\r\nhave been collected with a very considerable degree of completeness by\r\n_Aëtius_,[400] especially as copying Galen; the remaining authorities\r\ntreat them as a rule in conjunction with the corresponding affections\r\nof the genitals, and mostly recommend the same remedies for them. So\r\nfar therefore as they are concerned we refer back to the information\r\ngiven in connection with the latter. At the same time the remark may\r\nbe permitted that this juxtaposition of the two seems to point to the\r\nAncients having held, as we maintain they did, the view that affections\r\nof the genitals and affections of the anus arose from like causes and\r\nwere of like character, as is shown by their dealing with the one and\r\nthe other class of diseases on the same general lines.\r\n\r\n_Ardentes dolores_ (burning pains)[401] and _pruritus_ (itching)[402]\r\nof the anus are not uncommon. _Inflammations_[403] often supervene as a\r\nconsequence of fissures, morbid growths and ulcers. _Rhagades_ (cracks)\r\nand _fissures_[404] are found either in the sphincter muscle or in the\r\nrectum, and are an accompaniment of condylomata, whenever the latter\r\nbecome inflamed and spread, causing the surrounding tissue to rupture;\r\nthe edges frequently assume a callous condition, and then require to be\r\nbroken down and thus transformed into a simple ulcer. Often abscesses\r\nare set up[405] as a result of the inflammation, and these are liable\r\nto lead to fistulas. The ulcers[406] on occasion assume the character\r\nof the νομὴ φαγέδαινα (eating and spreading ulcer). Supposing them\r\nsituated on the sphincter ani, they must neither be cut nor cauterized,\r\nas severance of the muscle makes it impossible for the patient to\r\nretain the faeces. This loss of retentive power may also occur apart\r\nfrom any operation, if the νομη (spreading ulcer) destroy the muscle.\r\nSupposing on the contrary the νομὴ to be below the sphincter, knife or\r\ncauterizing iron may either of them be employed. In some instances\r\nulcers lead to a morbid growth at the orificium ani, that must be\r\nobviated by means of pipettes of lead.[407] In other cases _rhagades_\r\n(cracks) and ulcers lead eventually to morbid outgrowths.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Buboes.\r\n\r\n Bubo, panus (swelling resembling the thread wound on bobbin of a\r\n shuttle), paniculus (diminutive of same), inguen (swelling in the\r\n groin).\r\n\r\nUnder the name of _bubo_ the ancient Physicians understood any form\r\nof inflammation of the lymphatic glands. Now such inflammation occurs\r\nabove all other places in the inguinal region, and thus inflammation\r\nof the inguinal glands came to be especially indicated by the word, as\r\nwell as the inguinal region itself. Similarly the Romans used _inguen_\r\n(the groin) both for the region and for the disease. Subsequently\r\nmany distinctions were drawn; a phlegmonous affection combined with\r\nswelling was called a βουβὼν (bubo), while the name φῦμα (swelling)\r\nwas appropriated to a swelling of the glands characterized by its\r\nrapid establishment and its tendency to suppuration (bubo with\r\nsuppurative pustule in the centre), and φύγεθλον (burning swelling)\r\nto one conjoined with (cutaneous) inflammation of an erysipelas\r\ncharacter,[408] which last form, if it passes on into induration, is\r\nknown as χοιρὰς or _struma_ (scrofulous or strumous swelling). The\r\nbest exposition from the points of view equally of pathology and\r\ntherapeutics is found in _Galen_.[409] The glands in virtue of their\r\nspongy structure are peculiarly liable to take up rheums or fluxes of\r\nall descriptions; accordingly the glands of the groin, armpits and\r\nneck swell, directly ulcers are set up in the toes, fingers or head.\r\nThe body being overloaded with evil humours is another reason for the\r\nestablishment of buboes, and in this case they are more difficult\r\nto cure. Further, _Hippocrates_[410] derived buboes in women from\r\ninterrupted menstruation, and maintains[411] that the most part owe\r\ntheir origin to some affection of the liver.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Writers however are agreed that among other occasioning\r\ncauses ulcers hold the first place,[412] though none of them speak\r\nexpressly of ulcers of the genitals, unless indeed we see good to make\r\nthe passage of Hippocrates discussed a little above refer to these. No\r\ndoubt in this passage the words ἑλκώματα, φύματα ἔξωθεν ἔσωθεν τὰ περὶ\r\nβουβῶνας (ulcerations, tumours external and internal in the inguinal\r\nregion) might admit of such an explanation, in which case the words\r\nmust be taken not as referring to each single patient, but rather\r\nheld to mean that ulcers and glandular swellings with a tendency to\r\nsuppuration were set up, the latter occurring in some patients in the\r\nurethra, in others in the groin. Such an interpretation is favoured\r\nby the case of the Eunuch discussed in § 20, for there can be no doubt\r\nthe metathesis of buboes into fistulous ulcers was noted by Celsus and\r\nother observers. Still it is highly improbable that ulcers on the feet\r\nshould have afforded the sole and only cause of buboes; it is much\r\nmore natural to suppose that this, as being the more rare case, was\r\nfor that very reason brought into special prominence by the ancient\r\nPhysicians. Besides we have seen above that the old Physicians seldom\r\nor never really had an opportunity of seeing the sympathetic buboes, as\r\npatients treated the ulcers themselves, and the buboes then disappeared\r\nspontaneously. Oribasius no less than other Writers holds buboes\r\nfollowing on an ulcer to be without danger.\r\n\r\nLastly the cases are very rare in which secondary buboes under the\r\nprevailing tendency and course of the disease are thrown out on the\r\nskin, and if they do arise, the ulcer as a rule heals up. This being\r\nso, the Physician is consulted, only supposing the buboes refused to\r\ndisappear. On the contrary if the ulcer was still there, the Physician\r\nsought actually to stimulate it to enhanced activity, as is distinctly\r\nimplied by what _Galen_ says (loco citato). Lint smeared with\r\n_tetrapharmacum_ (compound of wax, tallow, pitch and resin), liquified\r\nby the addition of _oleum rosaceum_ (oil of roses) was applied and warm\r\npoultices over that; while on the actual bubo was laid in the first\r\ninstance wool moistened with oil, to which when the pain and swelling\r\nof the part were relieved, was added an admixture of salt. Plethoric\r\nor cacochymic (generating evil humours) subjects are to be bled or\r\ncupped. If the bubo is inflamed and inclined to suppurate, it must be\r\nscarified, the patient having first been purged. Dispersion is then\r\nattempted, in this case by means of pulp and honey poultices, but not\r\nby plasters, as these are apt to provoke inflammation. If pus appears,\r\nrecourse must not be had at once, as some advise, to opening with\r\nthe knife; rather the poultices should be persevered with till the\r\ninflammation is relieved. Acrid poultices are suitable only when the\r\nmetathesis to induration has already begun.\r\n\r\nIf dispersion does not follow and the matter has collected in greater\r\nquantities, then the most elevated spot, the same where the skin is the\r\nthinnest, should be opened. Should a part of the skin be discoloured,\r\nit must be cut away. Some advise always cutting out a piece in the\r\nshape of a myrtle-leaf, others make very long incisions; but this\r\nnot only causes a disfiguring scar, but often also interferes with\r\nthe movement of the part. As a general rule a single incision is\r\nsufficient, which should be made diagonally across the inguinal region,\r\nnot parallel with the direct diameter of the thigh, as then the edges\r\nare brought actually into contact when the limb bends.[413] After the\r\nopening of the abscess, it should be treated by preference with finely\r\nsifted frankincense, as should all forms of ulcer. We may mention\r\nfurther that according to Sextus Placitus Papyriensis[414] the wearing\r\nof a stag’s genitals was considered a _prophylactic_ against buboes.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Exanthemata on the Genitals.\r\n\r\nLong ago _Hensler_ endeavoured in the Graduation Theme of his\r\nmentioned in the list of Historical Authorities to prove that\r\ncertain eruptions occurring on the genitals were communicated and\r\nacquired as the result of coition. In particular did this apply\r\nabove all to _herpes_ (creeping eruption), under which name must be\r\nunderstood, as is distinctly implied in a passage of _Galen_,[415] a\r\nform of eruption accompanied by ulceration. It is true the passages\r\nof _Hippocrates_[416] cited by Hensler in regard to the _herpes\r\nesthiomenos_ (eating herpes) would appear to be open to some doubt\r\nand obscurity, while the interpretations given by _Pollux_ (Onomast.\r\nIV. 25. 191.) _φλυκτίς_, φλύκταινα ἐπιμήκες, μάλιστα περὶ βουβῶνας\r\nκαὶ μασχάλας. _φύγεθλον_, φῦμα περὶ βουβῶνα μετὰ πυρετοῦ, (φλυκτίς, a\r\nlong-shaped blister, particularly in the groin and armpits. φύγεθλον,\r\na tumour in the groin accompanied by fever) refer probably only to\r\nbubonic swellings; still these objections hardly apply to the φύματα\r\n(swellings) described in § 32,—the less so as _Celsus_ himself (VI.\r\n18.) explains: “Tubercula etiam, quae φύματα Graeci vocant, _circa\r\nglandem_ oriuntur, quae vel medicamentis vel ferro aduruntur; et cum\r\ncrustae exciderunt, squama aeris inspergitur, ne quid ibi rursus\r\nincrescat;” (Tuberculous swellings also, which the Greeks call φύματα,\r\narise _about the glans penis_, and are burned away either by caustic\r\ndrugs or by the actual cautery. Afterwards when the scabs have fallen\r\noff, the sore is dusted with slag of bronze, to prevent any second\r\ngrowth later on). Moreover it is possible the passage of _Galen_,[417]\r\nπρὸς δὲ τὰ ἐν αἰδοίοις φυόμενα ἀπίου σπέρμα ἐπίπασσε καὶ τραγείᾳ χολῇ\r\nπεριχρῖε. (But for growths on the privates sprinkle pear-juice and rub\r\nin goat’s gall) may refer to these cases, though no doubt it may also\r\nbe held to apply to the tubercles occurring in the female vagina (§\r\n41,—3. B.).\r\n\r\nAgain _epinyctis_ (night-pustule),[418] which Hensler also mentions\r\nbut declares to be equally open to suspicion as to interpretation,\r\nwould seem hardly pertinent in this connection, for the violent pain\r\nexperienced at once tells against the likelihood of its being an\r\naffection of this class. Its appearance _in eminentibus partibus_ (on\r\nprominent parts, on the extremities) finds a clear explanation in the\r\nwords added by _Pollux_ (loco citato, 197.) περὶ κνήμας καὶ πόδας ἐν\r\nνυκτὶ γενομένη (appearing on legs and feet during the night); while it\r\nis proved that Celsus meant to indicate nothing else by it from his\r\nwords in describing φλυζάκιον (little blister), which he says occurs\r\n_raro in medio corpore, saepe in eminentibus partibus_,—rarely on the\r\ntrunk, frequently on prominent parts, extremities. Still we do not for\r\na moment wish to dispute the fact that the male genitals were at any\r\nrate among the Ancients counted as belonging to the _partes eminentes_,\r\nand as chancrous blebs do usually appear suddenly and often during the\r\nnight, it is quite possible these may have been all along intended by\r\n_epinyctis_,—especially as on Hippocrates’ authority[419] creeping\r\neruptions (ἕρπητες) arise from night-pustules (ἐκ τῶν ἐπινυκτίδων.)\r\nHowever _Pollux_ (loco citato, 206.) likewise again mentions the legs\r\nand feet (κνήμαις καὶ ποσίν), declaring these eruptions attack those\r\nof elderly people. From this we may conclude the epinyctis of the\r\nAncient writers to have been very likely nothing else but that form of\r\n_impetigo_ (scabby eruption) which is vulgarly known as the _salt-flux_.\r\n\r\n_Aetius_[420] mentions _pustulae spontaneae in pudendis_ (pustules\r\nspontaneously set up on the privates), provoking _phimosis_, and\r\ndescribes[421] _scabies scroti_ (scab of the scrotum) with metathesis\r\ninto ulceration and scaliness, after the disappearance of which very\r\noften acute _pruritus scroti_ (itch of the scrotum) is left behind.\r\n_Galen_ (XIX. p. 449.) defines _psoriasis scroti_ (itching of the\r\nscrotum) as a form of induration of the scrotum accompanied by itching,\r\nas well as in some instances by ulcers.\r\n\r\nUnder exanthematic types come also the various _condylomata_. These\r\nwhen they appeared on the genitals and in other localities of the body,\r\nwere called by the Greeks σῦκος, συκώσις, σύκωμα, συκώδης ὄγκος, (fig,\r\nfiglike excrescence, figlike swelling, figlike lump), by the Romans\r\n_ficus_ (fig), whereas the same disease when it showed itself on the\r\nfundament, received the name of condyloma[422] _par excellence_. At\r\nthe same time this distinction was by no means strictly observed;\r\nin particular the larger forms of _thymus_ (warty excrescence) were\r\ndesignated by the name σῦκος (fig), albeit it would seem that _thymus_\r\nwas used as specific name for all protuberances on the fundament and\r\ngenitals. Σῦκος or _ficus_ is according to _Galen_[423] an ulcerative\r\ntubercle secreting moisture,—the _varus_ (blotchy eruption) on\r\nthe contrary being dry, according to _Oribasius_[424] of circular\r\nshape and reddish colour, hardish and rather painful. It is found\r\nabove all on the hairy parts of the body, the head, chin, fundament\r\nand genitals,[425] as the passages quoted above in § 13 from Martial\r\nshow. They occurred, as it would seem, most frequently on the female\r\ngenitals, in which situation they are described so long ago as by\r\n_Hippocrates_[426] under the name of κιων (pillar, pillar-like\r\nexcrescence) and said to be evil-smelling. _Aspasia_[427]\r\nsays, “condyloma est rugosa eminentia. Rugae enim circa os uteri\r\nexistentes dum inflammantur, attolluntur et indurantur, tumoremque ac\r\ncrassitudinem quandam in locis efficiunt.” (a condyloma is a wrinkled\r\nprotuberance. For when the wrinkles surrounding the orifice of the\r\nuterus grow inflamed, they become prominent and indurated, occasioning\r\na swelling and thickening in the parts). _Paulus Aegineta_ (III. 75.,\r\nVI. 71.) describes them under the name of _hemorrhoids_ as painful,\r\nreddish, excrescences suffused with blood, which break (διαλείμμασι),\r\nand give off a pale discharge in drops. Much more common was the\r\nappearance of _condylomata on the fundament_,[428][429] particularly\r\nin male subjects; in which case they were specially ascribed to\r\npederastia, as we have already seen. This makes it impossible to decide\r\ndefinitely which condylomata were of primary and which of secondary\r\ncharacter; but the fact in no way authorizes us to deny altogether the\r\noccurrence of the latter in Ancient times.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Morbid Outgrowths on the Genital Organs.\r\n\r\n σαρκώδη βλαστήματα, verrucae. (fleshy outgrowths, warty excrescences).\r\n\r\nThe general name θύμος (_thymus_,—warty excrescence), or according to\r\nCelsus perhaps more correctly θύμιον (small warty excrescence), appears\r\nto have been used by the Greeks to designate all morbid outgrowths,\r\nand particularly those of the genitals and fundament, while they\r\nappropriated the expressions σῦκος, ἀκροχορδὸν, and μυρμήκια (fig or\r\nfiglike excrescence, wart with a neck, wart growing directly on the\r\nskin) to signify the different subordinate species. The θύμιον, which\r\n_Celsus_[430] is the first Writer to delineate in detail, is a warty,\r\nreddish,—according to Paulus Aegineta white too in some cases, and as\r\na rule painless,—fleshy outgrowth, slender at the base, broader above,\r\nrather hard and rough at the top. Thus it bears a certain resemblance\r\nto the flower of the thyme, from which circumstance comes the name.\r\nThe upper part is easily split, and then bleeds,—more than might be\r\nexpected Aëtius says from its size; the same also sometimes happens\r\nspontaneously. Usually it has the size of an Egyptian bean, though\r\noccasionally it is quite small. Sometimes one such growth appears, at\r\nothers several are found together, now on the palms of the hands, now\r\non the soles of the feet; but the worst are always those on the genital\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nAccording to _Aëtius_, who calls the larger sorts σῦκος (fig),\r\n_thymus_ is also found on the fundament and on the face, in women on\r\nthe _labia_, in the entrance to the vagina and in the vagina itself,\r\nspreading thence to the fundament and even over the thighs. This is\r\nconfirmed by _Oribasius_, who as well as Paulus Aegineta and perhaps\r\nCelsus, distinguishes a _malignant_ and a _non-malignant_ form. The\r\nnon-malignant growths generally disappear of themselves; but if they\r\nare amputated, there remains behind, so says Celsus, a circular root\r\nwhich penetrates deep into the flesh; and not only do they grow again,\r\nbut further take the character of the malignant form, become painful\r\nand filled with a bloody ichor. The malignant show themselves both\r\nwith and without ulceration, as well as after the disappearance of the\r\nnon-malignant growth; they are harder, rougher and larger, have a dirty\r\nlivid hue, and are painful, particularly on being touched. Thymus on\r\nthe glans penis is more dangerous than when affecting the prepuce,[431]\r\nmore especially if it assume a carcinomatous character. If of the\r\nnon-malignant type it should be lightly scarified with the point of\r\na scalpel, then some mild escharotic employed, for which the Writer\r\njust named gives several prescriptions. If of the malignant type, it\r\nis according to Paulus Aegineta either tied with a horse-hair and then\r\nremoved by knife or cautery, or according to what Oribasius says the\r\nlatter is at once resorted to. But seeing thymus on the prepuce is\r\noften found affecting the inner and outer surfaces simultaneously,\r\ncautery must not be employed on both at once, for in that way the\r\nforeskin would be destroyed altogether. The better plan is to begin\r\nwith those situated on the inner surface, first cutting them away, then\r\ncauterizing, and finally when they are cicatrized proceeding to the\r\ntreatment of the others. But not a few are incurable.\r\n\r\nἈκροχορδὸν[432] is a smooth, circular, fleshy protuberance, having a\r\nslender circular base, so that it looks as though it hung on a string,\r\nwhence the name. It is painless and callous, usually has the same\r\ncolour as the skin, while its dimensions seldom exceed those of a\r\nbean. As a rule several occur together, but disappear again of their\r\nown accord, especially if they are only small, though on occasion\r\nthey get inflamed and suppuration follows; they leave no root behind\r\non amputation. According to _Galen_ and _Aëtius_ they occur on the\r\nfundament, according to Philumenes, as given in the latter author,\r\nlikewise on the female genitals. They are removed either by means of a\r\nthread or with the lancet, though escharotics and other acrid remedies\r\nare also employed.\r\n\r\nA highly inveterate form is the μυρμήκια, or _formica_ (ant) of\r\nlater Writers, which is almost always discussed by medical Authors\r\nconcurrently with ἀκροχορδόν. It is, Celsus tells us, less prominent\r\nand harder than the θύμιον, has deeper roots, is more painful, broad at\r\nthe bass and slender at the top, less suffused with blood and seldom\r\nlarger than a lupin-bean. The colour according to Aëtius is blackish.\r\nOn its being touched, the patient has the sensation of having been\r\nbitten by an ant. As an exactly similar growth appears on the hands,\r\nmost Writers, e. g. Celsus and Oribasius, speak only of this latter;\r\nbut Aëtius describes it expressly as occurring on the fundament and\r\non the female genitals; and it was observed in the latter situation\r\nby Philumenes, or Aëtius (loco citato, ch. 105.) in the case of _his\r\nown wife_, whom he cured by three days’ fumigation with _origanum_,\r\n(wild-marjoram). Not to mention the usual escharotic remedies, for\r\nwhich Aëtius in especial gives several formulæ, the following modes\r\nof treatment recommended by the medical Writers evidently apply to\r\nwarts on the hands only,—by extirpation with a myrtle-leaf shaped\r\nscalpel called a _scolopomachaerion_ (small pointed surgical knife),\r\nsqueezing off by means of a quill or metal pipette, and above all\r\nsucking with the lips and gnawing off. This last was in _Galen’s_ time\r\nespecially[433] a very fashionable treatment and is described by him as\r\na new discovery made at Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 42.\r\n\r\nRetrospect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we now turn back again and make a brief survey of the various forms\r\nof affections of the genitals described on preceding pages, comparing\r\nthem with those of the present day, such as we have opportunity to\r\nobserve in modern times, we think every unprejudiced reader will be\r\nfound ready to admit that they agree with these latter in _very\r\nnearly every_ respect whatever, and that _every_ doubt would be\r\nremoved, if only the medical Writers had appended to the records\r\nof their observations in each case the words, “got by infection in\r\ncoition.” But to what cause do we refer such cases as a matter of\r\nfact, notwithstanding the denial on the part of the patient that he\r\nhas exposed himself to any infection? Do we not take it for granted as\r\na certainty that such infection did actually precede? Are we in the\r\nhabit of noting down in every instance in our day-book of cases the\r\nantecedent act of coition that occasioned the chancre or what not; and\r\ndoes this omission in any way imply that this did not first occur? To\r\nour mind at any rate the fact suffices that non-professional observers\r\nand even a professional one like Galen have supplied irrefutable\r\nevidence that some of these affections were acquired by coition.\r\nAmongst others, morbid outgrowths for example are manifestly shown\r\nto have been so set up by the statement that they occurred on the\r\nfundament of pathics; and it needs no great perspicacity to draw the\r\nconclusion that if (unnatural) coition produced them in the pederast,\r\nthe same maladies occurring on the genital organs owed their origin to\r\nthe same cause.\r\n\r\nBut granting these maladies originated in coition, there must\r\nnecessarily have been some other factors active as well, besides the\r\nmere act. Thus when patients are found explaining to the physician\r\n(Galen) that the women with whom they had accomplished coition suffered\r\nfrom the same evil as themselves (gonorrhœa), no one surely can suppose\r\nanything but that a transmission of the disease took place in virtue\r\nof a contagion. Such affections of the genitals as are transmitted\r\nin coition by contagion we are wont to regard as primary forms of\r\nVenereal disease; and those acquired and disseminated in the same way\r\nin Antiquity must accordingly be designated by the same name. But these\r\nprimary forms extended not only to the genitals; they were equally\r\nand in the same way acquired through the various modes of _Venus\r\nillegitima_ (abnormal Love) in the anus and the mouth, localities\r\nwhere we are accustomed nowadays to see the secondary symptoms chiefly\r\nappear. Consequently it was impossible for the Ancients,—and is really\r\nand truly no less so down to the present moment for the Moderns,—to\r\nmake a definite distinction between primary and secondary forms. It is\r\nequally impossible to deny outright the former existence of the latter\r\nin these localities, the more so as, however wide the dissemination\r\nof vicious practices of various sorts, no very large number of men\r\nsuffering from a diseased member are likely to have misused mouth or\r\nanus.\r\n\r\nBut if we are forced in considering the secondary forms to leave mouth\r\nand anus almost entirely out of the question,[434] then only cutaneous\r\ndiseases and those affecting the bones are left us, for _ozaena_\r\n(fetid polypus), which was regarded as incurable by the Ancient\r\nphysicians,[435] cannot any more than the others be taken into account\r\nin connection with primary affections of the mouth, unless indeed we\r\nare prepared to look upon the ῥέγχειν (snorting) of the men of Tarsus\r\nas a secondary complaint of pathics.\r\n\r\nWith regard to _cutaneous affections_, we have seen how the forms\r\nof _lichen_ and _mentagra_ passed over into _psora_ and _lepra_ (§§\r\n23, 25), and how the conclusion to be drawn from this is plain, viz.\r\nthat the secondary cutaneous forms of Venereal disease were formerly\r\nassigned as belonging to leprosy. This seems to be confirmed by a\r\npassage of _Johannes Moschus_[436] that has only just been brought\r\nunder our notice, in which it is related how a monk of the Monastery\r\nof Penthula could no longer master the appeals of the flesh, travelled\r\nto Jericho to get relief from the “superfluity of his naughtiness” in\r\na brothel in that place; how when he had entered the house, he was\r\nsuddenly attacked by leprosy, whereupon he speedily returned to his\r\nMonastery. How much Venereal disease has in common with elephantiasis\r\nmust be determined by later investigations. At any rate it is worth\r\nwhile to note its frequent occurrence in Egypt, its establishment in\r\nItaly along with the various forms of _lichen_, its infectiousness, as\r\nwell as the statement of Celsus (III. 25.), who calls it an _ignotus\r\npaene in Italia morbus_ (a disease almost unknown in Italy), and that\r\neven the bones would appear to be affected by it.\r\n\r\nLastly, inasmuch as the tendency of the morbid process to strike\r\noutwards to the skin was conditioned by the influence of climate, while\r\ncutaneous forms of Venereal disease were amongst the most common of\r\noccurrences, it follows that not only were affections of the mucous\r\nmembranes bound to fall proportionally into the background and appear\r\nwith less frequency, but those of the bones as well. Still the mucous\r\nmembranes _were_ sometimes attacked, and _affections of the bones_ did\r\nalso undoubtedly occur, though with incomparably greater rarity,—such\r\naffections being, as is well known, at the present day of rare\r\noccurrence, and especially so in hot climates. Corrosion of the tibia\r\nis mentioned by Plutarch, and peculiar pains of the periosteum, which\r\nare so deep-seated and stable as to make the patient believe the bones\r\nthemselves to be the seat of the mischief, are spoken of as early as\r\nby _Archigenes_ cited by _Galen_,[437] the latter adding that these\r\npains were commonly known as οστοκοποι (racking the bones). If further\r\nwe ought to count in this connection those forms of _exostosis_ (morbid\r\nexcrescence) _of the bones of the skull_ described above in § 26,\r\nwhich it seems were so prevalent among the inhabitants of Cyprus as to\r\nhave gained for the island according to some authorities its name of\r\nΚεραστία (horned),[438] we should actually have to hand proofs of the\r\nexistence in Antiquity of _all_ the symptoms that at the present day\r\nconstitute Venereal disease. All we need to do is to unite these into\r\none general picture and give the name that is now sanctioned by custom,\r\nin order to arrive at the final result,—that _Venereal Disease_, though\r\nnot recognized and described as such by the Ancient Physicians, _was as\r\na matter of fact existent in Antiquity_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving reached this general result at the conclusion of the first Part\r\nof our Investigations, we would now seem only to have to co-ordinate\r\nthe various pieces of evidence thus far brought together without\r\nreference to time and place, but merely on the principle of similarity\r\nof contents, under local and temporal conditions, in order to obtain\r\na general exposition of _the development of Venereal Disease in\r\nAntiquity_. Willing as we may be to undertake the task, and necessary\r\nas its performance is,—for it is precisely this that constitutes the\r\nHistory properly so called of the Disease,—still we must freely admit\r\nthat for the present the fixed data indispensable for the work are too\r\nfew to enable us to do more than offer suggestive hints. At the same\r\ntime to supply these missing data by hypotheses that must necessarily\r\nlack all positive grounds, is not, at any rate in our opinion,\r\nconsistent with the dignity and duty of a Historian.\r\n\r\nAs to the _local_ determinations, those defining the places, to which\r\nsuch or such information given us belongs, are extremely scanty, and\r\nsuch as they are, we owe them mainly to the non-professional Authors.\r\nAmong the Physicians, who from the nature of the case must be chiefly\r\nconsidered here, they are all but entirely wanting; true they are\r\nalmost all Greek instances, still in the majority of cases it is left\r\nabsolutely undetermined whether the observations, the mere results of\r\nwhich moreover are given us, were made in Greece, at Rome or in Asia\r\nMinor. But even supposing knowledge amounting to certainty _were_\r\navailable on this point, yet the local range as compared with the whole\r\nAncient world is too limited to entitle us to use it successfully as\r\nevidence in drawing up a general History of the Disease.\r\n\r\nThe _temporal_ determinations are in no better case. This is especially\r\nso where the Physicians are concerned; not to mention the general\r\nuncertainty as to the epoch at which most of them lived and made their\r\nobservations, they are for the most part bad witnesses for this reason\r\nif for no other, that they have obviously copied one from another,\r\nor at any rate so far as their works are extant for our examination,\r\nutilized,—with the possible exception of Galen,—certain common sources\r\nof information, which unfortunately have been completely lost. The loss\r\nis the more to be deplored as the authorities in question belonged just\r\nto the most flourishing period of scientific Medicine, that of the\r\nAlexandrian physicians.\r\n\r\nYet another drawback is that up to the present we are entirely without\r\ninformation as to the consecutive order of the series of epidemics\r\nin Antiquity, by the indirect help of which alone do the historical\r\nfactors conditioning Venereal disease become discernible; while so\r\nfar as appears, there is no reasonable hope of our ever attaining\r\nany clearer light on the point. Nay! even if we did possess the\r\ninformation, it could only apply to Greece, Rome and Asia Minor, for\r\nas previously pointed out, in countries situated in the hot Zone the\r\n_genius epidemicus_ (general consensus of epidemic conditions) is but\r\nrarely as a rule strong enough to override the _genius endemicus_\r\n(general consensus of endemic conditions). As much therefore as can in\r\nsuch a state of things be predicated with some basis of reason as not\r\nentirely hypothetical may be pretty well summed up as follows:—\r\n\r\nDiseases of the genital organs developed little by little among nearly\r\nall the Peoples of Antiquity known to us at all intimately under the\r\nfavouring conditions detailed in preceding pages. At the same time in\r\nvirtue of the large number of counteracting influences they seldom\r\nattained to any high degree of intensity, and remained mostly local,\r\ntaking the form of mucous discharges and superficial ulcers, without\r\nprovoking any general reaction of the organism. Even when such reaction\r\ndid occur, it was the skin that felt it, in such a way as to throw off\r\nthe effects of morbid activity in the form of cutaneous maladies. These\r\nconditions lasted usually as long as the different Peoples continued\r\nto cultivate mutual exclusiveness; directly they abandoned this, and\r\nindividual members of different foreign stocks began to combine to\r\ngratify an unbridled licentiousness, affections of the genitals not\r\nonly increased in frequency, but over and above this a malignant\r\ncharacter was stamped upon them, with which both the development and\r\nthe intensity of any particular contagion stood in direct ratio.\r\n\r\nExamples are to be found in the Plague of Baal Peor among the Jews\r\nat Shittim (§§ 8. and 9. above), in the introduction of the cult of\r\nDionysus at Athens (§ 98.) and of Priapus at Lampsacus (§ 7.), both\r\nof which latter are connected with the March of Bacchus to and from\r\nIndia, as well as lastly in the introduction of the Lingam-worship in\r\nIndia itself (§ 6.). All these phænomena point to the conclusion that\r\na remarkable frequency and malignity of affections of the genitals was\r\nconnected with influences conditioned from without, amongst which we\r\nhave to reckon the general epidemic conditions. This becomes the more\r\ninteresting and important from the fact that we meet with the same\r\nthing again in the XVth. Century, a period when the incorrect view\r\ntaken of the circumstances led to the most contradictory opinions being\r\nheld. However both influences and effects were merely transitory, as\r\nis proved by the unanimous consensus of authorities that the phænomena\r\nprovoked by the conditions disappeared again after a certain interval\r\nof time, an interval that seems among the Jews only to have lasted\r\nsomewhat longer under endemic influence.\r\n\r\nStill under no circumstances does this justify us in arguing to a total\r\nabsence of all affections of the genital organs,—as is proved, no\r\ndoubt after an interval of more than a thousand years, (if indeed we\r\nare to admit the occurrences just mentioned to count at all as actual\r\nhistorical facts), by (1) the general weather conditions laid down by\r\nHippocrates and their consequences, and (2) an event that probably was\r\nconnected with the same conditions, the Plague of Athens described by\r\nThucydides. Here we find indisputable proof given us that affections\r\nof the genitals, as also most likely the contagion conditioning them,\r\nincreased under favourable epidemic influence in frequency, malignity\r\nand intensity, while concurrently the secondary forms manifested\r\nthemselves pre-eminently by symptoms of an exanthematic type.\r\n\r\nFor close on five hundred years onwards we are again left without\r\ninformation; but the statements contributed by Celsus show that\r\nmeantime there had been ample opportunities of observing and treating\r\naffections of the genitals. In the time of Pompey the Great, when\r\nThemison made his observations on the wide prevalence of satyriasis\r\nin Crete, there was developed, it would appear, though from what\r\ncauses is not known, a general consensus of predominantly exanthematic\r\nconditions, that seems to have continued for a long period of time,\r\nno doubt as was to be expected with sundry interruptions intervening.\r\nUnder favour of these conditions was developed in the first instance\r\nelephantiasis, and later on under the Emperor Claudius _mentagra_,\r\nwhich above all in Martial’s time afflicted the Romans, while caricous\r\ntumours (_ficus_) became an every-day complaint. From that epoch\r\nonwards, direct historical evidences more and more tend to disappear,\r\ntill eventually it is only in the prescription-books of Physicians that\r\nwe gather any inkling of the continued necessity for medical aid and\r\nconcurrently of the existence of Venereal Disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n                                  OF\r\n

this Book in two Vols. August\r\n               MDCCCXCVIII at Nymeguen, Holland, at the\r\n                    Printing-House of G. J.

XII. 37., Ruminatio autem dicta est\r\na _ruma_, eminente gutturis parte, per quam dimissus cibus a certis\r\nanimalibus revocatur (Now rumination is so called from the _ruma_, or\r\ngullet, the upper portion of the throat, by which food after being\r\nswallowed is brought up again by certain animals). It is true _Varro_\r\ngives another explanation: ruminare propter _rumam_, id est prisco\r\nvocabulo mammam (to ruminate so called on account of the _ruma_, that\r\nis in old Latin the breast); and so one might equally well understand\r\nby _irrumare_ the custom of voluptuaries, one that is still practised,\r\nof employing the space between the bosoms as _vagina_. At any rate\r\n_Dr. Hacker_ of Leipzig assured the author he had on several occasions\r\nobserved cases where prostitutes had chancrous swellings between the\r\nbosoms, as well as under the arm-pits,—for these also are employed with\r\nthe same object.—Does _ruma_ possibly stand for _rima_ (a chink)? In\r\nany case we should compare what _Suidas_ gives under the words ῥῦμα,\r\nῥῦμη and ῥύμματα. Synonyms are _comprimere linguam_, _buccam offendere_,\r\netc. (to compress the tongue, to hit against the cheek).\r\n\r\n[2] The etymology of _fellare_ is still obscure. _Vossius_, Etymolog.,\r\nderives it from the Æolic φηλᾶν for θηλᾶν and θηλάζειν, to suck the\r\nbreasts. _Pliny_, Hist. Nat. bk. XI. 65., says of the tongue of cats:\r\nimbricatae asperitatis ac limae similis, attenuansque lambendo cutem\r\nhominis (of a ridged roughness of surface, like a file, capable of\r\nwearing through the human skin by licking). The meanings which _Suidas_\r\ngives under φελλά, etc. would seem to point to an old stem φέλλω,—to\r\nroughen, to file.\r\n\r\n[3] _Lucian_, Works, edit. Lehmann, Vol. VIII. pp. 56-84.\r\n\r\n[4] πρὸς θεῶν, εἶπέ μοι, τὶ πάσχεις, ἐπειδὰν κἀκεῖνα λέγωσιν οἱ πολλοὶ,\r\n_λεσβιάζειν_ σε καὶ _φοινικίζειν_; (for translation see text above); as\r\nto φοινικίζειν, this will be discussed later on. The word λεσβιάζειν\r\noccurs in Aristophanes, Frogs 1335; and he also uses λεσβιεῖν in\r\nthe same sense, Wasps, 1386., μέλλουσαν ἤδη λεσβιεῖν τοὺς ξυμπότας;\r\n(a girl standing ready to λεσβιεῖν—love in the Lesbian mode,—the\r\nrevellers). On this passage the Scholiast remarks: ἵνα μὴ τὸ παλαιὸν\r\nτοῦτο καὶ θρυλλούμενον δι’ ἡμετέρων στομάτων εἴπω σόφισμα, ὅ φασι\r\nπαῖδας Λεσβίων εὑρεῖν. (this ancient trick, a matter of common gossip\r\nto any in our mouths, which they say the children of the Lesbians\r\ninvented).—_Suidas_ s. v. _Λεσβίαι_· μολύναι τὸ στόμα. Λέσβιοι γὰρ\r\nδιεβάλλοντο ἐπὶ αἰσχρότητι. (under the word Λεσβίαι—Lesbian women, to\r\ndefile the mouth. For the Lesbians were reproached for foulness).\r\n_Hesychius_: λεσβιάζειν· πρὸς ἄνδρα στόμα στύειν. Λεσβιάδας γὰρ τὰς\r\nλαικαστρίας ἔλεγον. (to play the Lesbian; to use the mouth to a man for\r\nan obscene purpose. For they used to call wanton courtesans Lesbians).\r\n_Eustathius_, Comment. ad Homeri Iliad, p. 741., εἰσὶ βλασφημίαι\r\nκαὶ ἀπὸ ἐθνῶν καὶ πόλεων καὶ δήμων πολλαί, ῥηματικῶς πεποιημέναι·\r\n_ἐθνῶν_ μὲν, οἵον _κιλικίζειν_ καὶ _αἰγυπτιάζειν_, τὸ πονηρεύεσθαι, καὶ\r\n_κρητίζειν_, τὸ ψεύδεσθαι· ἐκ _πόλεων_ δὲ, οἷον _λεσβιάζειν_, τὸ\r\nαἰσχροποιεῖν· εἶτα παραγαγόντες Φερεκράτους χρῆσιν ἐν Ἰάμβῳ τὸ δώσει\r\nδέ σοι _γυναῖκας ἑπτὰ Λεσβίας_· ἐπάγουσιν ἀμοιβαῖον τί· _καλον_ γε\r\nδῶρον ἕπτ’ ἔχειν λαικαστρίας· ὡς τοιούτων οὐσῶν τῶν Λεσβίων γυναικῶν·\r\nἐκ _δήμων_ δὲ βλασφημία, τὸ _αἰξωνεύεσθαι_, ἤγουν κακολεγεῖν. Αἰξωνεῖς\r\nγὰρ δημόταται Ἀττικοί, σκωπτόμενοι ὡς κακολόγοι, καθὰ καὶ οἱ Σφήττιοι\r\nἐπὶ ἀγριότητι. (And there are many reproaches applying to nations, and\r\ncities, and demes, implied in the use of certain words; for instance in\r\nthe case of nations, to play the Cilician, and to play the Egyptian,\r\ni. e. to be a rogue, and to play the Cretan, i. e. to be a liar; again,\r\nin the case of cities, to act the Lesbian, i. e. to act filthily;\r\nfurther we may bring forward a passage of Pherecrates in Iambic verse,\r\nviz. the line, “And he shall give thee seven Lesbian women,” to which\r\nthe answering verse is, “Verily! a noble gift, to get seven harlots,”\r\nimplying that such was the character of the Lesbian women. Lastly an\r\nexample of such a reproach applying to demes, to play the Æxonian, in\r\nother words to be foul-mouthed. For the Æxonians were Attic demes-men,\r\nridiculed as being evil-speakers in the same way as the Sphettians were\r\non the ground of rusticity). The word σόφισμα (trick) in the passage\r\nof the Scholiast to Aristophanes explains the word “dogma” in Martial,\r\nbk. IX. 48., Dic mihi, percidi, Pannice, _dogma_ quod est? (Tell\r\nme, Pannicus, what is the trick of the paederast?). _Theopompus_ in\r\n“Ulysses” says: δι’ ἡμετέρων στομάτων εἴπω σόφισμ’ ὅ φασι παῖδας Λεσβίων\r\nεὑρεῖν. (a certain trick common in our mouths which they say children\r\nof the Lesbians invented). _Strattis_ in “Pytisus”: τῷ στόματι δράσω\r\nταῦθ’ ἅπερ τοῦ αἰσχροῦ τάττεται [ταῦθ’ ἅπερ οἱ Λέσβιοι]. (with my mouth\r\nI will do those things that are reckoned as obscene,—those things that\r\nthe Lesbians do).]\r\n\r\n[5] Haud scio an Rhododaphnes cognomine a Syris isti tradito\r\ntecte sugilletur cunnilingus, ita ut rosa lateat cunnus, in lauri\r\nfolio lingua lingens, (I cannot say for certain whether by the\r\nsurname of “Rhododaphne”—rose-laurel—given the man by the Syrians\r\nit is covertly suggested he was a _cunnilingus_, as much as to say\r\nthat while a _cunnus_—female organ—is suggested by the rose, a\r\nlicking tongue is the same in the laurel-leaf), says _Forberg_, loco\r\ncitato p. 281. _Suidas_, s. v. ῥοδωνία· ἔστι μὲν ὁ τῶν ῥόδων λείμων·\r\nἄλλοι δὲ καὶ τὴν _ῥοδοδάφνην_ οὕτω φασὶ καλεῖσθαι (under the word\r\nῥοδωνία—rose-garden: it is the meadow of roses; but others again say\r\nthis is called ῥοδοδάφνη). _Pliny_, Hist. Nat. XVI. 33. _Hesychius_, s.\r\nv. ῥοδωνία says: δηλοῖ δὲ καὶ _τὸ ἀνδρὸς αἰδοῖον_ αὕτη. (under the word\r\nῥοδωνία—rose-garden: this signifies also _the human genitals_).\r\n\r\n[6] The explanation of this is to be found in the Priapeia\r\nCarmina, 75.\r\n\r\n  _Barbatis_ non nisi _summa_ petet.\r\n\r\n(With bearded men will touch but the extremities).\r\n\r\n[7]_Pseudo-Galen_, Works, edit. Kühn, Vol. XIX. p. 142.\r\n\r\n[8] Handbuch der Klinik (Hand-book of Clinical Medicine), vol.\r\nVII. p. 88. Also at a yet earlier date in Schmidt’s Jahrbuch 1837.,\r\nVol. XIII. p. 101.\r\n\r\n[9] _Στομάργου_, ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ τῶν ἐπιδημιῶν ὁ Διοσκουρίδης\r\nοὕτως γράφει, καὶ δηλοῦσθαι φησὶ τοῦ λαλοῦντος μανικῶς· οἱ δὲ ἄλλοι\r\n_στυμάργου_ γράφουσι καὶ ὄνομα κύριον ἀκούουσι. (_Στομάργου_: in the\r\nsecond Book of the Epidemia Dioscorides writes the word thus, and says\r\nit signifies such as talk insanely; others however write στυμάργου, and\r\nunderstand it as a proper name).\r\n\r\n[10] _Hippocrates_, Bk. II. sect. 2. edit. Kühn, Vol. III. p.\r\n436., Καὶ ἡ Στυμαργέω ἐκ ταραχῆς ὀλιγημέρου πολλὰ στήσασα, κ. τ. λ.\r\n(And the female slave of Stymargeos having after a few days’ disturbance\r\nre-established much, etc.)—The same passage occurs in _Galen_, Comments\r\non the Epid. bk. II. edit. Kühn, Vol. XVII. A. p. 324., with an\r\nexplanation of the subject-matter, and also has Στυμαργέω.—_Ibidem_,\r\np. 458., ἡ _Στυμάργεω_ οἰκέτις ἡ _Ἰδουμαῖα_ ἐγένετο, κ. τ. λ. (the\r\nfemale slave of Stymargeos, the Idumaean, was, etc.).—_Galen_ cites\r\nthe passage, _loco citato_ p. 467., without comment, but he likewise\r\nreads Στυμάργεω. In two other passages, in which he comments on the\r\nstatements last quoted from Hippocrates, the text is obviously corrupt.\r\nIn “De tremore, palpitatione, convulsione et rigore” (Of Trembling,\r\nPalpitation, Convulsion and Rigor), edit. Kühn, vol. III. p. 602, it\r\nreads: Ἐστυμάργεω οἰκέτις, ᾗ οὐδὲ αἵμα ἐγένετο, ὡς ἔτεκε θυγατέρα, κ.\r\nτ. λ. (a female slave of Estymargeos, in whose case flowed no blood at\r\nall, when she gave birth to a daughter, etc.). Also _Assmann_ in his\r\nIndex to Kühn’s Edition of Galen, pp. 232 and 307., represents it by\r\n_Estymergi ancilla_ (a female slave of Estymergus). However there can\r\nbe no doubt Ἡ Στυμάργεω οἰκέτις (The female slave of Stymargeos) ought\r\nto be read in Galen; on the other hand we see clearly from this passage\r\nthat the text of Hippocrates is quite wrong in giving the Proper name\r\nἡ Ἰδουμαῖα (the Idumaean), and this, as indeed the sense too requires,\r\nmust be changed into ᾗ αἵμα οὐδὲ (in whose case not even blood); and\r\none is more especially convinced of this on reading the explanation\r\ngiven by _Galen_, _loco citato_. Besides this, following Galen’s lead,\r\nwe should read δεῖ ἐλθεῖν for διελθεῖν and προφάσεως for προφάσιος.\r\nAlso he has ἀφορμὴν instead of ἀχὴν.—The _second_ passage of _Galen_\r\noccurs in the “De venae sectione” (On the opening of a Vein) adv.\r\nErasistrat., ch. 5.: ἐκεῖνο δέ πως εἴρηται; _ἐκ τοῦ μαργέω_ οἰκέτιδος\r\n_οὐδὲ αἵμα ἐγένετο_, ὡς ἔτεκε θυγατέρα, ἀπέστραπτο τὸ στόμα _πρός_ [τῆς\r\nμήτρας καὶ ἐς] ἰσχίον καὶ σκέλος ὀδύνη, παρὰ σφυρὸν τμηθεῖσα _ἐράϊσε_\r\n[ἐῤῥῄισε], καίτοι τρόμοι τὸ σῶμα _περικατεῖχον_ [πᾶν κατεῖχον]· ἀλλ’ ἐπὶ\r\nτὴν πρόφασιν _χρὴ ἐλθεῖν_ καὶ τῆς προφάσεως _τὴν τροφήν_. (Now how is\r\nthis account given? from a female slave of Stymargeos not even blood\r\nflowed, when she gave birth to a daughter; the mouth was distorted from\r\n(the womb, and in) loin and leg there was pain; on being cut (bled) on\r\nthe ankle, she found relief, though shudderings ran down the (whole)\r\nbody; but we must go to the cause, and the origin of the cause). Here\r\ntoo it is evident, besides the emendations already pointed out as\r\nnecessary, we must read ἐκ Στυμάργεω, as the edition of Kühn, vol. XI.\r\np. 161., does actually and rightly read. _Dioscorides_ may be right\r\nso far, that the word, _strictly speaking_, is not a “Nomen proprium”\r\n(Proper name), but in the passage named it stands for one, if only, as\r\nis likely enough, for a nickname, as it is called.\r\n\r\n[11] _Athenaeus_, Deipnos., bk. I. ch. 8., quotes from the “Phaon” of\r\nthe Comic Poet Plato: τρίγλη—καὶ _στύματα μισεῖ_. (a mullet,—and hates\r\nerections). Comp. bk. VII. ch. 126.\r\n\r\n[12] The verb στύω (I erect the penis) occurs often in\r\n_Aristophanes_, e. g. “Acharnians” 1218., στύομαι (I have an erection),\r\n“Peace”, 727., ἐστυκότες (men with penes standing), “Lysistr.” 214.,\r\nἐστυκὼς (a man with penis standing), 598., στῦσαι (to make the penis\r\nstand), 869., ἔστυκα γὰρ (for my penis was standing); always in the\r\nsense of to make, or have, an erection.\r\n\r\n[13] _Suidas_ explains μάργος by μαινόμενος (being mad) and\r\n_Hesychius_ also by ὑβριστὴς (recklessly insolent), a word we have\r\nalready learned from repeated examples to recognize as signifying\r\nunnatural lust. _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedag., bk. II. ch. 1. p.\r\n146., says: καὶ ἡ λαιμαργία, μανία περὶ τὸ λαιμόν, καὶ ἡ γαστριμαργία,\r\nἀκρασία, περὶ τὴν τροφήν· ὡς δὲ καὶ τοὔνομα περιέχει, μανία ἐπὶ\r\nγαστέρα· ἐπεὶ μάργος, ὁ μεμῃνώς. (And gluttony, i. e. madness in\r\nconnection with the gullet, and greediness, i. e. intemperance in\r\nconnection with food, in other words as the name implies, madness as to\r\nthe belly; for μάργος means a madman).\r\n\r\n[14] _Lucian_, Pseudologist. ch. 21., uses ἔργον (work) of the\r\n_Irrumator_ and _Fellator_. Similarly _Horace_, Epod. VIII. 19, says:\r\n\r\n                      fascinum\r\n      Quod ut superbo provoces ab inguine,\r\n     _Ore allaborandum_ est tibi.\r\n\r\n(a member ... that needs, for you to provoke it to rise from the\r\nunsympathetic groin, to be worked with your mouth). _Ovid’s_ phrase\r\n“dulce opus” (sweet task) and _Horace’s_ “molle opus” (gentle task)\r\nare familiar. Comp. _Hesychius_, s.v. ἀῤῥητουργία,—αἰσχρουργία,\r\nκακουργία, τὰ ἀῤῥητα ἐργάζεσθαι, (under the word ἀῤῥητουργία, infamous\r\naction,—base action, evil action, the performance of infamous tasks).\r\n\r\n[15] The word στόμαργος is found in _Sophocles_, in a passage\r\nwhere Electra says to Clytaemnestra (581):\r\n\r\n    Κήρυσσέ μ’ εἰς ἅπαντας, εἴτε χρὴ, κακὴν,\r\n    εἴτε _στόμαργον_, εἴτ’ ἀναιδείας πλέαν.\r\n    Εἰ γὰρ πέφυκα _τῶνδε τῶν ἔργων_ ἴδρις\r\n    σχεδόν τι τὴν σὴν οὐ καταισχύνω φύσιν.\r\n\r\n(Proclaim me to all, if need be, an evil woman, _foul-mouthed_ and full\r\nof shamelessness. For if I am cunning _in these tasks_, it is but that\r\nI am not far from sharing your own character). _Suidas_ under the word\r\ninterprets στόμαργος here by φλύαρος (prating). _Philo_, De Monarchia\r\nbk. I. edit. Mangey, vol. II. p. 219., says: _στομαργίᾳ_ χρήσασθαι καὶ\r\nἀχαλίνῳ γλώσσῃ, βλασφημοῦντας οὓς ἕτεροι νομίζουσι θεούς. (to indulge\r\nin _loose talking_ and an unbridled tongue, blaspheming such as other\r\nmen hold to be gods). The _Etymologicum Magnum_ s. v. γλώσσαργον,\r\n_στόμαργον_ ἠ ταχύγλωσσον, (under the word idle-tongued,—_foul-mouthed_\r\nor loose-tongued). Whereas _Aristophanes_ has the word στοματουργός,\r\n“Frogs” 848.,\r\n\r\n    ἔνθεν δὴ _στοματουργὸς_ ἐπῶν\r\n    βασινίστρια λίσπη\r\n    γλῶσσ’....\r\n\r\n(So thence a _phrase-making_ word-sifting, smooth tongue ...)\r\n\r\n[16] Comp. p. 172 above. _Lucian_, Pseudolog. ch. 31., calls it\r\nπαροινῶν (acting drunkenly). _Athenaeus_, Deipnos. bk. XIII. ch. 80.,\r\nφιλόπαις δ’ ἦν _ἐκμανῶς_ καὶ Ἀλέξανδρος, ὁ βασιλεύς. (And he was a\r\nlover of boys, _to an insane degree_, was Alexander the King). _Dio\r\nChrysostom_, Tarsica I. p. 409., says of the ῤέγχειν (snorting of the\r\nCinaedi): ἀλλ’ ἐστὶ σημεῖον τῆς αἰσχάτης ὕβρεως καὶ _ἀπονοίας_ (but\r\nit is a sign of the most abandoned insolence and _infatuation_), and\r\nagain p. 412.: ὡς ἤδη μανία τὸ γιγνόμενον ἔοικεν αἰσχρᾷ καὶ ἀπρέπει\r\n(so now the resulting condition resembles madness, disgraceful and\r\nunseemly madness). _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedag. bk. III. ch. 8.,\r\nπερὶ τὰ παιδικὰ _ἐκμανῶς_ ἐπτοημένοι (men set upon enjoyments with boys\r\n_insanely_). But above all is the following passage from Juvenal (Sat.\r\nVI. 299) apposite in this connection:\r\n\r\n    ... Quid enim Venus ebria curat?\r\n    Inguinis et capitis quae sint discrimina nescit.\r\n\r\n(For of what does drunken love take heed? What are the differences\r\nbetwixt groin and head, she ignores). _Seneca_, De ira II.: _Raptus_\r\nad stupra et _ne os quidem libidini exceptum_. (Carried away\r\ninto obscenities and not even the mouth held secure from lust).\r\n_Lactantius_, VI. 23., Quorum teterrima libido et execrabilis _furor_\r\nne _capiti_ quidem parcit. (Whose most foul lust and abominable\r\n_frenzy_ spares not even _the head_).\r\n\r\n[17] _Xenophon_, Cyropaed. II. 2. 28. Hence too _Cicero_, Tuscul.\r\nV. 20., Haberet etiam _more Graeciae_ quosdam adolescentes amore\r\nconiunctos (he would keep also, _after the fashion of Greece_, sundry\r\nyoung men bound to him in ties of affection); of course it is a\r\nquestion here of Paedophilia merely, but we have seen how readily this\r\nwas confounded with Paederastia. _Aristophanes_, Eccles. 918.,\r\n\r\n    ἤδη τὸν ἀπ’ Ἰωνίας\r\n    τρόπον τάλαινα κνησιᾷς·\r\n    δοκεῖς δέ μοι καὶ λάβδα κατὰ τοὺς Λεσβίους.\r\n\r\n(Now, wretched woman, you itch after the fashion of Ionia; and you\r\nappear to me to long even for the _Lambda_ (licking) of the Lesbian\r\nmode). Hence _motus Ionicos_ (Ionic movements) in _Horace_, Odes III.\r\n5. 24. and _Plautus_, Stich. V. 7. 1., Quis _Ionicus_ aut cinaedus qui\r\nhoc tale facere posset. (What _Ionian_ or cinaedus is there could show\r\nhimself capable of such an act as this).\r\n\r\n[18] _Hippocrates_, Epidem. bk. II. sect. 1. edit. Kühn, Vol. III. p.\r\n435.\r\n\r\n[19] Comment. in Hippocrat. Epidem., bk. II. edit. Kühn, Vol. XVII. A.\r\np. 312.\r\n\r\n[20] _Martial_, bk. XII. 55., Nec clusis aditum neget labellis. (and\r\nrefuse not access by shutting the lips).\r\n\r\n[21] Μύζουσις is cited by _Eustathius_ on Homer, Odyssey XVII. p. 1821.\r\n52. and XIV. p. 1921. end, as also ἀπομύζουρις on Iliad XI. p. 867.\r\n44., in the sense of _fellatrix_, παρὰ τὸ μυζᾶν, ἤγουν θηλάζειν οὐράν.\r\n(connected with μυζᾶν, to suck, that is to say to suck like an infant\r\na man’s member). _Suidas_ says: μυζεῖ καὶ μύζει, θηλάζει λείχει μῦ,\r\nμύζει· ἀπὸ τοῦ μῦ παρῆκται τὸ μύζειν, πολλοῖς ἄλλοις ὁμοίως· μύζειν δέ\r\nἐστι τὸ τοῖς μυκτῆρσιν ἦχον ἀποτελεῖν. _Ἀριστοφάνης_ τί μύζεις,—(μυζεῖ\r\nand μύζει,—sucks like an infant, licks with a _mooing_ noise, _moos_);\r\nfrom this _mooing_ noise is derived μύζειν as is the case with other\r\nsimilar words; now μύζειν is to produce the noise made in the nostrils\r\nin the act of sucking. Aristophanes has τί μύζεις; (what is the\r\nmooing noise you make?) On this passage of Aristophanes (Thesmoph.\r\n238.) the Scholiast observes: τοῦτο δὲ φώνημα σημαίνει ἔκλυσίν τινα\r\nἀφροδισιαστικήν· ὅθεν καὶ μύται ἐλέγοντο τὸ παλαιὸν ἀφροδισιασταὶ καὶ\r\nγυναικομανεῖς. (Now this sound proclaims a certain dissoluteness in\r\nlovemaking; whence of old voluptuaries and men mad after women were\r\ncalled also μύται). Μῦς, the mouse, also comes from the same stem,\r\nfrom its picking and gnawing; so does μυῖα, the fly, and as _Aelian_,\r\nHist. Anim. bk. XV. ch. 1., says of a fish, ὑποχανὼν κατέπιε τῆν μυῖαν\r\n(it gaped its mouth and swallowed down the fly), we might perhaps read\r\nμυιοχάνη after flies, as if she wanted to catch flies, a fly-catcher,\r\nfly-trap, unless indeed we prefer to take μυιοχάνη as being a\r\ncompound-word expressing a high degree of lecherousness. The lecherous\r\nnature of the fly is well-known, as well as their habit of licking,\r\nwhich makes _Varro_, de Re Rust. III. ch. 15., say: Non ut muscae\r\n_liguriunt_. (They do not _lick_, like flies). Ligurire (to lick) is\r\nused in the sense of _fellare_ and _cunnilingere_. _Aelian_, Hist.\r\nAnim. bk. IV. ch. 5., mentions a fish, χάνη, which is particularly\r\nlustful: χάνη δὲ ἰχθὺς λαγνίστατος (Now the χάνη is a most lustful\r\nfish). Again μυσαροχάνη (μυσαρὸς, filthy) would be a significant word\r\nfor a _fellatrix_.\r\n\r\n[22] _Suidas_, s. v. _μυσάχνη_, ἡ πόρνη παρὰ Ἀρχιλόχῳ· καὶ _ἐργάτις_\r\nκαὶ _δῆμος_ καὶ _παχεῖα_. Ἱππῶναξ δὲ _βορβορόπιν_ καὶ ἀκάθαρτον ταύτην\r\nφησίν. ἀπὸ τοῦ βορβόρου καὶ _ἀνασυρτόπολιν_, ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνασύρεσθαι.\r\nἈνακρέων δὲ _πανδοσίαν_ καὶ _λεωφόρον_, καὶ _μανιόκηπον_· κῆπος γὰρ\r\nτὸ _μόριον_. Εὔπολις _εἰλίποδα_, ἐκ τῆς εἰλήσεως τῶν ποδῶν τῆς κατὰ\r\nτὴν μίξιν. (under the word μυσάχνη; this means “the prostitute” in\r\nArchilochus; also in same sense _working-woman_, and _commonalty_,\r\nand _brawny wench_. Also Hipponax calls an unclean woman of the sort\r\n_filthy-eyed_ (βορβορόπις) from βόρβορος, mire, and _town-exposer_\r\nἀνασυρτόπολις from ἀνασύρεσθαι, to pull up the clothes. Also Anacreon\r\nuses _all-giving_ and _public thoroughfare_ and _mad in the privates_\r\n(μανιόκηπος); for κῆπος (a garden) means a woman’s private parts.\r\nEupolis uses _walking with a rolling gait_, from the rolling of the\r\nlegs, the result of sexual intercourse).\r\n\r\n[23] _Lampridius_, Life of Heliogabalus ch. 5. _Clement of Alexandria_,\r\nPaedag. bk. III. p. 254. edit. Potter, ἁβροδίαιτος περιεργία πάντα\r\nζητεῖ, πάντα ἐπιχειρεῖ, βιάζεται πάντα· συνέχει τὴν φύσιν· τὰ γυναικῶν\r\nοἱ ἄνδρες πεπόνθασιν καὶ γυναῖκες ἀνδρίζονται παρὰ φύσιν· γαμούμεναί\r\nτε καὶ γαμοῦσαι γυναῖκες· _πόρος δὲ οὐδεὶς ἄβατος ἀκολασίας_.\r\n(delicately-living idleness searches out all things, attempts all\r\nthings, forces all things. It constrains Nature. Men have come to\r\nendure the treatment proper to women, while women act as men contrary\r\nto nature; women are both given in marriage and themselves take men in\r\nmarriage, and _no way of impurity is left untrod_. Again of a similar\r\nsignificance are perhaps the words μυριοστόμος (ten-thousand-mouthed)\r\nand ἀθυροστόμος, ἀθυροστομία, ἀθυροστομέω (unrestrained of mouth,\r\nunrestrainedness of mouth, to be unrestrained of mouth), and εὐρόστομος\r\n(wide-mouthed). _Epicrates_ said of a lecherous girl, ἡδ’ ἀρ’ ἦν μυωνία\r\n(she was a regular mouse-hole), and _Philemon_ called another μῦς\r\nλεύκος) (white mouse), while _Aelian_, Hist. Anim. Bk. XII. ch. 10,\r\ngives yet another similar expression, μυωνίαν ὅλην ὀνομάσας (having\r\nnamed her a complete mouse-hole); she is a perfect mouse-hole, in other\r\nwords she has as many entrances as a mouse-hole. Instead of μυριοχαύνη\r\nwe might also read μυριομήχανος (of ten-thousand devices), referring to\r\nthe _fessus mille modis_ (fatigued by a thousand modes of pleasure) in\r\n_Martial_, bk. IX. 58. and on the analogy of Δωδεκαμήχανος (of a dozen\r\ndevices), a name borne by the “fille de joie” Cyrené, because she had\r\ncontrived twelve different _postures of Love_. Comp. _Suidas_, under\r\nword δωδεκαμήχανος, and the Scholiast on Aristophanes, “Frogs” 1356.\r\nAlso μιαροχάνη (μιαρὸς, polluted) might be defended, on reference to\r\n_Aristophanes_, Acharnians 271-285.\r\n\r\n[24] _Hippocrates_, Epidem. bk. II. Vol. III. p. 436. Galen, vol. XVII.\r\nA. p. 322.\r\n\r\n[25] Perhaps the word was σαπερδίς, which in _Aristotle_, Hist. Anim.\r\nVIII. 30., signifies a certain fish, for in _Athenaeus_, Deipnos. p.\r\n591., σαπέρδιον (the diminutive) is the nick-name of a _hetaera_, and\r\nwhen _Diogenes_ (Diogenes Laertius, VI. 2. 6.) made a scholar wear a\r\nσαπέρδης, the latter threw it away (ὑπ’ αἰδοῦς ῥίψας), (having cast it\r\nfrom him in disgust). Note at the same time that the word _Sarapis_\r\nalso occurs in _Plautus_ (Paenulus V. 5. 30 sqq.), where Anthemonides\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n      Ligula, i in malam crucem\r\n    Tune hic amator audes esse, hallex viri?\r\n    Aut contrectare, quod mares homines amant?\r\n    Deglupta maena, _Sarapis_ sementium,\r\n    Mastruga, ἃλς ἀγορᾶς ἅμα; tum autem plenior.\r\n    Allii ulpicique, quam Romani remiges.\r\n\r\n(Thou mannikin, go to and be crucified! Dost dare to play the lover\r\nhere, thou Tom Thumb of a man? or to meddle with what male men love?\r\nSkinned sprat, _Sarapis_ of the corn-crops, sheepskin, common salt\r\nof the market; and yet reeking worse of garlic and leek than Roman\r\nbargees!). To restore this undoubtedly corrupt text is beyond our\r\npowers, but this much at any rate results from the passage as a\r\nwhole that _Sarapis_ or _Sarrapis_ here too signifies a vicious man.\r\nAnthemonides certainly takes Hanno, to whom this speech is addressed,\r\nfor a _cinaedus_, for he says later on: “nam te cinaedum esse arbitror\r\nmagis quam virum” (but I reckon you to be a cinaedus rather than a\r\nman), and he had previously said: “Quis hic homo est _cum tunicis\r\nlongis_, quasi puer cauponius?” (Who is this fellow _with the long\r\ntunics_, like a waiter at a cookshop?) and “Sane genus hoc muliebrosum\r\nest tunicis demissitiis.” (Surely this is a womanish sort, _with his\r\ntrailing tunics_). Similarly _Turnebus_, Adversar. bk. X. ch. 24.,\r\nmentions the fact that _Hesychius_ explains σάραπις by περσικὸς χιτὼν\r\n(a Persian tunic). However he prefers to read, instead of _Sarrapis_,\r\n_arra pisa ementium_, (pledge of such as buy at the price of one pea) in\r\nreference to the vice of Bacchus, “obscoenum et mollem virum, qui pro\r\narra dari possit vilis mercimonii.” (a foul and deboshed man, fit only\r\nto be given as pledge at the value of any cheap commodity).\r\n\r\n[26] Comp. the passage of Lucian quoted on p. 229 above. _Suetonius_,\r\nTiberius ch. 44., “Majore adhuc et turpiore infamia flagravit,\r\nvox ut referri audirive, nedum credi, fas sit. Quasi pueros primae\r\nteneritudinis, quos pisciculos vocabat, institueret, ut natanti\r\nsibi _inter femina versarentur_ ac luderent, lingua et morsu sensim\r\nappetentes, atque etiam quasi infantes firmiores, necdum tamen lacte\r\ndepulsos, inguini seu papillae admoveret; pronior sane ad id genus\r\nlibidinis et natura et aetate. Quare Parrhasii quoque tabulam, in qua\r\nMeleagro Atalanta ore morigeratur, legatam sibi sub conditione, ut si\r\nargumento offenderetur, decies pro ea sestertium acciperet, non modo\r\npraetulit, sed et in cubiculo dedicavit.” (He was guilty of a yet\r\nmore flagrant and abominable villainy, so much so it hardly admits\r\nof being related or listened to, let alone believed, to this effect.\r\nHe arranged that boys of tender years, whom he called his little\r\nfishes, should move about between his thighs, as he swam, and play\r\nthere making darts at him with tongue and mouth and biting him softly;\r\nalso infants of somewhat stronger growth, but still not yet weaned,\r\nhe would put to his member as if to their mothers’ teat, being indeed\r\nboth by natural disposition and time of life more apt to this form\r\nof indulgence. So when a picture of Parrhasius, in which Atalanta is\r\nrepresented _gratifying_ Meleager with her mouth, was willed to him\r\nwith the stipulation that, if he objected to the subject, he should\r\nhave a million serterces instead, not only did he choose the painting,\r\nbut actually enshrined it in his bed-chamber). _Theophrastus_, Charact.\r\nch. 11., ὁ δὲ βδελυρὸς τοιοῦτος, οἵος ὑπαντήσας γυναιξὶν ἐλευθέραις\r\n_ἀνασυράμενος_ δεῖξαι τὸ αἰδοῖον. (But he was such a filthy wretch,\r\nthat on meeting free women he would _pull up his clothes_ and show\r\nhis private parts.—_Dionysius of Halicarnassus_, Excerpt. de Legat.\r\nch. 9. says of the Tarentine Philonis, _ἀνασυράμενος_ τὴν ἀναβολὴν\r\nκαὶ σχηματίσας ἑαυτὸν ὡς αἴσχιστον ὀφθῆναι, τὴν οὐ λέγεσθαι πρέπουσαν\r\nἀκαθαρσίαν κατὰ τῆς ἱερᾶς ἐσθῆτος τοῦ πρεσβευτοῦ κατεσκέδασε.\r\n(_raising his mantle_ and throwing himself into the most disgusting\r\nposture to be exposed in, he bespattered the Ambassador’s sacred robe\r\nwith the unspeakable filth).—_Galen_, Exhortat. ad artes ch. 6.,\r\nἀνασυράμενοι προσουροῦσι. (lifting up their clothes, they make water\r\nover it).—_Lucian_, Cataplus 13., καὶ σὺ δὲ ὦ Ἑρμῆ; σύρετ’ αὐτὸν εἴσω\r\nτοῦ ποδός. (You too, Hermes? drag ye him within your leg). _Clement\r\nof Alexandria_, Protrept. p. 13, mentions an Ἀφροδίτη περιβασίη\r\nAphrodité protectress,—or otherwise, Aphrodité that stretches the legs\r\napart), known also to _Hesychius_, and explained by some Commentators\r\nas “stretching the legs apart”. In _Suidas_ σαίρειν is explained by\r\n_hiare_ (to gape open); and the Lexicographers give σάραβος as meaning\r\nγυναικεῖον αἰδοῖον (a woman’s privates) and the word is found in _Dio\r\nChrysostom_, De regno IV. 75., as the name of a Tavern-keeper,—also\r\nif we are not mistaken, in Plato. σάρων too _Hesychius_ explains by\r\nγυναικεῖον (woman’s parts). He also has ἀρρενώπες (masculine-looking),\r\nwhich some interpret by Androgyne (man-woman) or _fellator_. The\r\nreading ἀγράπους occurring, we might also read γυρόπους (crook-footed);\r\n_Suidas_ under word γραῦς (old woman) cites: ἡ γρῆϋς, ἡ χερνῆτις, ἡ\r\nγυρὴ πόδας. (the old woman, the spinster, the _crooked of feet_).\r\n\r\n[27] _Catullus_, Carm. 35. 64.,\r\n\r\n    An continentes quod sedetis insulsi\r\n    Centum, aut ducenti, non putatis ausurum\r\n    Me una ducentos _irrumare sessores_?\r\n\r\n(Think you, because you sit there side by side, a hundred fools, or two\r\nhundred, think you I shan’t dare to _irrumate_ two hundred _sitters_ at\r\nonce?).\r\n\r\n[28] _Aelian_, Hist. Anim. bk. VI. ch. 24., ἡ δὲ ἡσύχως καὶ πεφεισμένως\r\nτοῦ ἑαυτῆς στόματος ἀνατρέπει αὐτούς. (but the fox, quietly and so\r\nas to forbear biting with its mouth, turns them over). ch. 64., ἥδε\r\nχανεῖν τε καὶ ἐνδακεῖν οὐ δυναμένη, κᾆτα οὔρησεν αὐτοῦ ἐς τὸ στόμα.\r\n(but she—the fox—being unable to open her mouth and fix her teeth in,\r\nfinally made water into its mouth).\r\n\r\n[29] Virgil, Aen. VI. 494., says of Deiphobus, Helen’s paramour:\r\n\r\n    Atque hic Priamiden laniatum corpora toto\r\n    Deiphobum vidit, lacerum crudeliter ora,\r\n    Ora manusque ambas, populataque tempora raptis\r\n    Auribus, _et truncas inhonesto vulnere naris_.\r\n\r\n(And now Deiphobus he sees, the glorious Priam’s son;\r\n\r\n    But all his body mangled sore, his face all evilly hacked,\r\n    His face and hands; yea, and his head laid waste, the ear lobes lacked,\r\n    And _nostrils cropped unto the root by wicked wound and grim_.\r\n\r\n      WILLIAM MORRIS’S translation).\r\n\r\n_Martial_, bk. III. Epigr. 85.,\r\n\r\n    Quis tibi persuasit _nares abscindere moecho_?\r\n      Non hac peccatum est parte, marite, tibi\r\n    Stulte, quid egisti? nihil hic tua perdidit uxor,\r\n      Cum sit salva sui mentula Deiphobi.\r\n\r\n(Who persuaded you to crop the adulterer’s nostrils? ’Twas not with\r\nthis part the offence was done you, sir husband! Foolish man, what\r\nhave you done? in this your wife has lost naught, so long as her\r\nDeiphobus’ member is safe and sound). _Martial_, bk. II. Epigr. 83.,\r\n\r\n    Foedasti miserum, marite, moechum:\r\n    Et se, qui fuerant prius, requirunt\r\n    _Trunci naribus_ auribusque vultus.\r\n    Credis te satis esse vindicatum?\r\n    Erras!

Think you\r\nyour revenge is complete? Nay! you are mistaken; the fellow can still\r\n_irrumate_!)—a passage that might very well be made to prove our point.\r\n\r\n[30] _Martial_, bk. XI. Epigr. 61.,\r\n\r\n    Lingua maritus, _moechus ore_ Maneius.\r\n\r\n(Maneius is a husband with his tongue, a debaucher with his mouth). Bk.\r\nIII. Epigr. 84.,\r\n\r\n    Quid narrat tua _moecha_? non puellam\r\n    Dixi, Tongilion. Quid ergo? _Linguam!_\r\n\r\n(What tale is it your harlot tells? Nay! I did not say _girl_,\r\nTongilion. What then? Why, _tongue!_).\r\n\r\n[31] _Diodorus_, Bk. I. ch. 60. Same is related in _Strabo_, Geogr. bk.\r\nXVI. p. 759.—_Seneca_, De Ira bk. III. ch. 20.\r\n\r\n[32] _Sozomen_, Hist. Eccles. bk.

(But Rhinocolura at that time abounded in\r\n_men of piety_, not invited thither, but _natives_, the most eminent\r\nof whom I have been informed devoted themselves in that place to\r\nthe study of Wisdom. I knew personally Melanas, then Bishop of the\r\nchurch there, and Dionysius, governing a monastery lying to the South\r\nof the City, and Solon, brother of Melanas and his successor in the\r\nBishopric.). The same is affirmed by _Nicephorus_ as well, (Hist.\r\nEccles. bk. XI. ch. 38.). Within the last two years there has appeared\r\na Tract or Occasional Paper, dealing with the Colony at Rhinocolura,\r\nbut unfortunately we cannot put our hand on the more precise memorandum\r\nof its contents.\r\n\r\n[33] As to his views on the _Morbus Phoeniceus_ (Phoenician Disease),\r\nthis will be discussed under the head of the vice of the _Cunnilingue_.\r\n\r\n[34] _Bonorden_, “Die Syphilis” (Syphilis).

Hence the expressions, _os male\r\nolens_, _anima foetida_, _gravis_, _graveolens_, _graveolentia oris\r\nspiritus ieiunio macer_, _ieiuna anima_, _hircosum osculum_, _basia\r\nolidissima_. (evil-smelling mouth, fetid breath, foul, ill-smelling,\r\nfetid smell of the breath from the mouth—hungry and lean, fasting\r\nbreath, goaty kiss, most smelly embraces). Possibly too this was the\r\norigin of the Lemnian women’s punishment. Comp. above p. 148.\r\n\r\n[37] _Galen_, Comment. on Hippocrates’ De Humor. bk. II., edit. Kühn,\r\nVol. XVI. p. 215. Different means of counteracting this evil are given\r\nby _Galen_, De parabilib. bk. II. ch. 7., Vol. XIV. p. 424. of Kühn’s\r\ned., where amongst other matter we read: διαμασῶνται δέ τινες καὶ τῆς\r\nπίτυος φύλλα, ὅταν ἐκπορεύωνται, _καὶ ὕδατι διακλύζονται_, (but others\r\nchew up even leaves of the pine, when they go abroad, and _wash out the\r\nmouth with water_), the Latin _lavare_, _aquam sumere_ (to wash, to\r\ntake water)?—as to which later.\r\n\r\n[38] _Martial_, VI. 55.,\r\n\r\n    Quod semper cassiaque cinnamoque\r\n    Et nido niger alitis superbae\r\n    Fragras plumbea Nicerotiana,\r\n    Rides nos, Coracine, nil olentes,\r\n    Malo, quam bene olere, nil olere.\r\n\r\n(Because forever scented with cassia and cinnamon and smeared with\r\nspices from the nest of the proud phoenix, you are fragrant of the\r\nleaden caskets of Niceros, you laugh at us that are unscented; I had\r\nrather even than smell sweet, not smell at all).\r\n\r\n[39] So _Euripides_, Medea 525., joins together στόμαργον γλωσσαλγίαν\r\n(busy-mouthed tongue-tiresomeness, i. e. wearisome talkativeness).\r\n\r\n[40] Perhaps there is an allusion to this in _Martial_, bk. XI.\r\n\r\n[41] _Martial_, Bk. VI. Epigr. 41. Also bk. IV. Epigr. 41.,\r\n\r\n    Quid recitaturus circumdas vellera collo?\r\n    Conveniunt nostris auribus illa magis.\r\n\r\n(Why do you when going to read your verses aloud wind woollen wraps\r\nround your throat? The wool were better in our ears). The _tacere_\r\n(to hold his tongue) in the first Epigram stands for _fellare_, as\r\nin _Martial_, VII. IX. 5. 96. Perhaps too the verse of Epicharmus\r\ngiven in _Aulus Gellius_, Noct. Attic. I. ch. 15. is applicable in\r\nthis connection, οὐ λέγειν δύνατος, ἀλλὰ σιγᾷν ἀδύνατος. (Not able to\r\nspeak, yet unable to be silent). Comp. _Martial_, VI. 54. VII. 48. XII.\r\n35.—“_Harpocratem_ reddere (to recall _Harpocrates_” in _Catullus_\r\n74. 4.) Again _Minutius Felix_, In Octav., says: “Esse malae linguae,\r\netiamsi _tacerent_” (To be of a _foul_ tongue, _even if they kept\r\nsilence_). _Priapeia_, 27. 4., “altiora tangam” (I will touch higher\r\nthings). In part we may have to look for the same allusion also in\r\n_Ausonius’_ Epigrams 46, 47 and 51, and several other very similar ones\r\nin the Anthology.\r\n\r\n[42] _Aretaeus_, De causis et signis acutorum morborum, (Of the causes\r\nand symptoms of Acute Diseases). Comp. De Curatione acut. morb., (Of\r\nthe treatment of Acute Diseases), Bk. I. ch. 9.\r\n\r\n[43] _Martial_, bk. X.

Epigr. 14.: Urbis deliciae\r\nsalesque Nili. (Darling of the City, savour of the Nile).\r\n\r\n[45] The fact that, according to _Prosper Alpin_ De Medicina\r\nAegypt.—(Of Egyptian Medicine, Bk. I. ch. 14.), gangrenous sore-throat\r\nprevails all the year round among children in Egypt, need not prejudice\r\nour conclusion; in fact it rather helps to explain how the sore-throat\r\nbrought on by _fellation_ was able so readily and quickly to assume the\r\nmalignant type described.\r\n\r\n[46] _Aëtius_, Tetrab. I. Serm. IV. ch. 21. Perhaps the “Cancer oris”\r\n(cancer of the mouth) in boys, of which _Celsus_, VI. 15., makes\r\nmention, belongs to the same category.\r\n\r\n[47] _Herodotus_, Bk. II. ch. 60.\r\n\r\n[48] _Plutarch_, De superstitione II. 170 D., Τὴν δὲ Συρίαν θεὸν οἱ\r\nδεισιδαίμονες νομίζουσιν ἂν μαινίδας τὶς ἢ ἀφύας φάγῃ τὰ ἀντικνήμια\r\nδιεσθίειν, ἕλκεσι τὸ σῶμα πιμπλάναι, συντήκειν τὸ ἧπαρ. (for\r\ntranslation see text above). We may add that μαινίδας is the _maena_\r\n(sprat) of the Romans, for which _Hesychius_ has σαραπίους, while\r\n_Plautus_ uses _deglupta maena_ (skinned sprat) as a contemptuous name\r\nfor a vicious debauchee (above p. 238. Note 1.). By the Dea Syra some\r\nhave understood the goddess Derceto, who was worshipped at Ascalon\r\nunder the image of a maiden, whose lower half ended in a fish. To her\r\nthe fishes were sacred, and for this reason the Syrians were forbidden\r\nto eat fish. Comp. _Lucian_, De Dea Syra p. 672. _Diodorus Siculus_,\r\nII. 4.\r\n\r\n[49] _Porphyrius_, De Abstinentia bk. IV. ch. 15.,\r\n\r\n    παράδειγμα τοὺς Σύρους λαβέ·\r\n    Ὅταν φάγωσιν ἰχθὺν ἐκεῖνοι διά τινα\r\n    Αὑτῶν ἀκρασίαν, τοὺς πόδας καὶ γαστέρα\r\n    Οιδοῦσιν· εἶτα σακκίον ἔλαβον· εἰς δ’ ὁδὸν\r\n    Ἐκάθισαν αὐτοὶ ἐπὶ κόπρου καὶ τὴν θεὸν\r\n    Ἐξιλάσαντο τῷ ταπεινῶσαι σφόδρα.\r\n\r\n(As an example take the Syrians: These people, when they have eaten\r\nfish, in consequence of some unwholesome quality in themselves, swell\r\nin feet and belly. Then they take quickly a wallet; and down they sit\r\nby the road-side on dung, and so appease the goddess by their exceeding\r\nhumbleness). At Athens ἕλκη ἔχειν ἐν τοῖς ἀντικνημίοις (to have sores\r\non the shin-bones) would seem to have been a usual thing, according to\r\n_Theophrastus_, Charact. XIX.\r\n\r\n[50] _Athenaeus_, Deipnosoph. bk. VIII. p. 346. d. Indeed it would seem\r\nthat the Stoic _Antipater_ of Tarsus related how a Syrian Queen Gatis\r\nwas excessively fond of eating fish, and accordingly forbad anyone ἄτερ\r\nΓάτιδος (except Gatis) in the whole country to indulge in it, and from\r\nthis circumstance came the name of Atergatis—the Syrian Venus!\r\n\r\n[51] _Martial_, Bk. I. Epigr. 79. Possibly also the passage in\r\n_Hippocrates_, Epidem. bk. VII., Vol. III. 691 of Kühn’s ed., ὁ τὸ\r\nκαρκίνωμα τὸ ἐν τῇ φάρυγγι καυθεὶς ὑγιὴς ἐγένετο ὑφ’ ἡμέων, (The\r\npatient who was cauterized for cancer of the throat recovered under\r\nour treatment), which Jöhrens in a quotation to be given presently\r\n(below § 25.) refers to Venereal disease, as is also done by him in the\r\ncase of the throat-ulcers mentioned in the Tract of _Hippocrates_, De\r\nDentitione (On Teething), Vol. I. p. 484. of Kühn’s ed.\r\n\r\n[52] A striking analogy to this suicide is to be found in the\r\nwell-known passage of _Pliny_ (Epist. bk. VI. epist. 24.), one of much\r\nimportance in connection with affections of the genitals, which may\r\ntherefore very well be quoted here by anticipation:\r\n\r\n_C. Plinius Macro Suo S._ Quam multum interest, quid a quo fiat!\r\nEadem enim facta claritate vel obscuritate facientium aut tolluntur\r\naltissime, aut humillime deprimuntur. Navigabam per Larium nostrum,\r\nquum senior amicus ostendit mihi villam, atque etiam cubiculum, quod\r\nin lacum prominet. Ex hoc, inquit, aliquando municeps nostra cum\r\nmarito se praecipitavit. Causam requisivi. _Maritus ex diutino morbo\r\ncirca velanda corporis ulceribus putrescebat: uxor, ut inspiceret,\r\nexegit: neque enim quemquam fidelius indicaturam, possetne sanari.\r\nVidit, desperavit: hortata est, ut moreretur, comesque ipsa mortis,\r\ndux immo et exemplum et necessitas fuit._ Quod factum ne mihi quidem,\r\nqui municeps, nisi proxime auditum est; non quia minus illa clarissimo\r\nArriae facto, sed quia minor est ipsa. Vale. (Caius Pliny to his friend\r\nMacer, Greeting.—What a vast difference it makes, by whom a particular\r\nthing is done! For the very same actions in virtue of the fame or\r\nobscurity of the doers are raised to the topmost pinnacle or brought\r\ndown to the lowest depth. I was sailing along our Lake of Larius, when\r\nmy companion and elder pointed out a certain country house to me, nay,\r\na particular bed-room, which projects into the Lake. From this chamber,\r\nhe said, some time ago a fellow-countrywoman of ours threw herself,\r\nalong with her husband. I asked the reason. _The husband, it seemed,\r\nin consequence of a disease of long standing was rotting with ulcers\r\non the private parts of the body. The wife demanded a right to look;\r\nfor she thought no one else likely to give a more conscientious opinion\r\nthan herself as to whether he could be cured. She saw, and despaired\r\nof recovery; so she urged him to die, and herself was companion of his\r\ndeath, giving in fact at once incitement, example and compulsion to\r\nthe deed._ This achievement I had never, though a man of the country,\r\nheard of till that moment; not because it was a whit less glorious than\r\nArria’s renowned exploit, but solely because the doer was less famous.\r\nFarewell).\r\n\r\n[53] _Catullus_, Carm. 57:\r\n\r\n    Pulchre convenit improbis cinaedis\r\n    Mamurrae pathicoque, Caesarique.\r\n\r\n(An excellent understanding exists between the vile _cinaedi_, the\r\npathic Mamurra and Caesar).\r\n\r\n[54] _Suetonius_, Vita Jul. Caesaris chs. 49, 51, 52., where Curio, the\r\nElder, calls him (Caesar) “omnium mulierum virum, et omnium virorum\r\nmulierem” (husband of all women, and wife of all men). The same indeed\r\nwas said also of _Alcibiades_. In _Athenaeus_, Deipnos. bk. XII. p.\r\n535., we read in a fragment of the Comic Poet _Pherecrates_:\r\n\r\n    Οὐκ ὢν ἀνὴρ γὰρ Ἀλκιβιάδης, ὡς δοκεῖ,\r\n    ἀνὴρ ἁπασῶν τῶν γυναικῶν ἐστι νῦν.\r\n\r\n(For not being a man at all, Alcibiades, it seems, is now husband of\r\nall our women).\r\n\r\n[55] _Catullus_, Carm. 80.:\r\n\r\n    Quid dicam, Gelli, _quare rosea ista labella_\r\n      _Hiberna fiant candidiora nive,_\r\n    Mane domo cum exis, et cum te octava quiete\r\n      E molli longo suscitat hora die.\r\n    Nescio quid certe est. An vere fama susurrat,\r\n      _Grandia te medii tenta vorare viri_?\r\n    Sic certe clamant Virronis rupta miselli\r\n      Ilia, et _emulso labra notata sero_.\r\n\r\n(Would you have me tell, Gellius, why those rosy lips grow whiter\r\nthan the winter’s snow, when you sally out from home in the morning,\r\nand when the eighth hour of the long summer day wakes you from gentle\r\nsleep? Nay! I know not what it is for sure. Does report say true, that\r\nwhispers _you mouth the swollen member of a man’s middle_? So at any\r\nrate declare the deboshed vigour of poor feeble Virro, and _your own\r\nlips marked by the humour you draw out_). _Martial_, Bk. VII. Epigr.\r\n94.:\r\n\r\n    Bruma est, et riget horridus December,\r\n    Audes tu tamen osculo nivali\r\n    Omnis obvios hinc et hinc tenere,\r\n    Et totam, Line, basiare Romam.\r\n    Quid possis graviusque saeviusque\r\n    Percussus facere atque verberatus?\r\n    Hoc me frigore basiet nec uxor.\r\n    Blandis filia nec rudis labellis.\r\n    Sed tu dulcior, elegantiorque,\r\n    Cuius livida naribus caninis,\r\n    Dependet glacies, rigetque barba,\r\n    Qualem forficibus metit supinis\r\n    Tonsor Cinyphio Cilix marito.\r\n    Centum occurrere malo _cunnilingis_,\r\n    Et Gallum timeo minus recentem.\r\n    Quare si tibi sensus est pudorque,\r\n    Hibernas, Line, basiationes,\r\n    In mensem, rogo, differas Aprilem.\r\n\r\n(’Tis winter time, and the shuddering chill of December is upon us.\r\nNone the less, Linus, you dare to greet with your frosty salute all men\r\nyou meet here and there, and to kiss all Rome. What more disagreeable\r\nor more cruel could you do, if you had been struck or thrashed? With\r\nan embrace so chilling may no wife kiss me, or unripe maid with\r\nwheedling lips. But you,—you think yourself more attractive and more\r\npleasing, you from whose dog-like nose a blue icicle hangs, whose beard\r\nis frozen stiff, such a beard as the Cilician shearer crops with his\r\nupward-pointing clippers from the chin of a Cinyphian he-goat. I had\r\nrather meet a hundred _cunnilingues_; I am less afraid of a Gaul new\r\ncome to town. Wherefore, if you possess any sense or any shame, I do\r\nbeseech you, Linus, defer your wintry salutes till April is come). Now\r\n_Linus_ is designated by _Martial_, bk. VII. Epigr. 9, as a _fellator_,\r\nand bk. XI. Epigr. 26., as a _cunnilingue_.\r\n\r\n[56] Whence also the proverbial saying in _Suidas_: κύνα δέρειν\r\nδεδαρμένην· τὸ τοῦ Φερεκράτους· σχῆμα δέ ἐστι ἀκόλαστον εἰς τὸ\r\nαἰδοῖον· εἴρηται δὲ ἐπὶ τῷ, ἄλλο πασχόντων αὖθις ἐφ’ οἷς πεπόνθασιν ἡ\r\nπαροιμία. (to skin the skinned bitch; expression of Pherecrates; is an\r\nabominable practice in connection with the private parts; the proverb\r\nis spoken of such as suffer something a second time over, after having\r\nsuffered it once already). Similarly _Plautus_, Trinum. II. 4. 27.,\r\nEdepol _mutuum_ mecum facit (By my faith, he plays give and take with\r\nme). Again κυνάμυια (shameless fly) is found in _Suidas_, which he\r\nexplains by ἀναιδεστάτη· παρεσχημάτικε τὸ ὄνομα ἀπὸ τοῦ κυνὸς καὶ τῆς\r\nμυίας· ὁ μὲν γὰρ κύων ἀναιδής, ἡ δὲ μυῖα θρασεῖα, (a most shameless\r\nwoman: name borrowed figuratively from the dog and the fly; for the\r\ndog is shameless, and the fly audacious)—probably with a reference to\r\n_Homer_, II. XXI. 394., where κυνόμυια is found, and the Scholiast\r\nobserves: ἀναιδής ὡς μυῖα, ἐκ δύο ἀναιδῶν τελείων, τοῦ τε κυνός καὶ\r\nτὴς μυίας, διὰ τὸ ὑπερβάλλον τῆς ἀναιδείας. (shameless as a fly; from\r\ntwo completely shameless creatures, the dog and the fly; on account\r\nof the excessive degree of their shamelessness). Further there is in\r\nthis connection the word κυναλώπηξ (fox-dog), which was a nick-name\r\nof _Philostratus_, as we see from _Aristophanes_, Knights 1078., on\r\nwhich passage the Scholiast observes: λέγει δὲ αὐτὸν καὶ πορνοβοσκὸν\r\nκαὶ καλλωπιστὴν (now he calls him both brothel-keeper and dandy). If\r\nwe derive the word from τὸν κύνα (frenulum praeputii,—ligament of the\r\nprepuce,—Paulus Aegineta, VI. 54.) ἀλωπίζειν, it would designate the\r\n_fellator_, as ἀλωπὸς, ἀλωπίζειν, ἀλωπηκίζω is formed from α privative\r\n(negative) and λῶπος, λώπη (the covering, skin, wool); and ἀλωπηκία\r\nis to be explained in the same way,—but not from the scab or mange of\r\nthe fox, nor yet as the Etymologicum Magnum would have it, because the\r\nplaces where the fox discharges his urine die, the grass e. g. dries\r\nup and withers. Hence ἀλώπηξ might be taken as _bald-headed_, and\r\nthen the further meaning of licentious dissoluteness given to it, for\r\nin Antiquity baldness was very usually looked upon as a consequence\r\nof sexual excesses, and as every one knows, Caesar was called by his\r\nsoldiers _moechus calvus_ (the bald-headed adulterer). But old men, who\r\nin particular are bald-headed, especially practised, owing to their\r\nlack of the power of erecting the penis, the vice of _irrumation_\r\nand of the _cunnilingue_, which makes _Martial_ say (IV. 50.) _Nemo\r\nest, Thai, senex ad irrumandum_ (No one, Thais, is too old a man for\r\nirrumation). κυναλώπηξ would then be a _bald-headed cunnilingue_.\r\nPossibly however this idea was also partly due to a reminiscence of\r\nthe fox’s habit, when desirous of following up a scent, of sticking\r\nhis head to the ground (_Aelian_, Hist. Anim. VI. ch. 24.),—a manœuvre\r\nhe also adopts, as is generally known, when dying. In evidence of this\r\nview may be quoted what _Cicero_, Orat. pro Domo ch. 18., says to\r\nSextus Clodius: _ligurris_ (you are a licker), and ch. 31. Quaere hoc\r\nex Sexto Clodio, iube adesse, latitat omnino; sed si requiri iusseris,\r\ninvenient hominem apud sororem tuam (Publii Clodii) _occultantem se\r\ncapite demisso_ (Require this of Sextus Clodius, bid him appear; he\r\nlurks entirely out of sight. But if once you order him to be sought\r\nout, they will find the man at your sister’s house (Publius Clodius’s)\r\n_hiding himself with head held down_.) Comp. _Catullus_, 87. In\r\n_Martial_, Bk. IV. Epigr. 53., _canis_ is used in same sense as κύων\r\nin Greek,—apparently? Perhaps the women of Antiquity made use of dogs\r\nas well to serve as _cunnilingues_. According to _Brockhusius_ on\r\nTibullus I. 7. 32., II. 4. 32. they were usual companions of “ladies of\r\npleasure” at Rome, whence too _suburanae canes_ (bitches of the Subura)\r\nin _Horace_, Epod. V. 58. and _Subura vigilax_ (the watchful Subura)\r\nin _Propertius_, IV. 7. 15. During the Middle Ages at any rate such an\r\nemployment of dogs was nothing unusual. This is stated by _Panormita_,\r\nHermaph. Epigr. XXX., Epitaphium Nichinae Flandrensis, Scorti egregii:—\r\n\r\n    Pelvis erat cellae in medio, qua saepe lavabar,\r\n    Lambebat madidum blanda catella femur.\r\n\r\n(Epitaph on Nichette the Fleming, a famous Harlot:—There stood a basin\r\nin middle of the chamber, in which I would many a time wash myself, the\r\nwhile my fawning bitch-pup licked her mistress’s dripping thigh).\r\n\r\nand Epigr. XXXVII.,\r\n\r\n    Te viset Jannecta, sua comitante catella,\r\n    Blanda canis dominae est, est hera blanda viris.\r\n\r\n(Jeannette shall visit you, her bitch-pup accompanying her; complacent\r\nis the hound to its mistress, the lady complacent to men).\r\n\r\n[57] _Galen_, De simplic. medicament. temperamentis ac facultat. Bk. X.\r\nch. 1., edit. Kühn Vol. XII. p. 249.\r\n\r\n[58] κοπροφάγος (Excrement-Eater). To this _Martial_, bk. III. Epigr.\r\n77., seems to allude, when he says:\r\n\r\n    Nescio quod stomachi vitium secretius esse\r\n      Suspicor, ut quid enim, Baetice, _saprofagis_?\r\n\r\n(I suspect there exists some secret vitiation of the stomach; else why,\r\nBaeticus, do you _eat putrid meat_?)\r\n\r\n[59] It is evident from this that Meier in his above mentioned Article\r\non Paederastia is wrong in citing the expression αἰσχρουργὸς (worker\r\nof obscenities) as being used for the direct equivalent of _cinaedus_.\r\nIncidentally we would take this opportunity of further observing\r\nthat the word παιδοκόραξ (boy-raven, i. e. a person ravenous after\r\nboys), which is also mentioned in the same Article as synonymous with\r\n_cinaedus_, is wrongly referred to paederastia, for it really, like the\r\nLatin _corvus_ (raven), signifies a _fellator_. Its true explanation\r\nis given in _Pliny_, Hist. Nat. bk. X. ch. 15., Corvi pariunt cum\r\nplurimum quinos. _Ore eos parere aut coire vulgus arbitratur._ (Ravens\r\nproduce at most a brood of five each pair. _The vulgar believe these\r\nbirds produce or copulate with the mouth)._—Aristoteles (De gen anim.\r\nBk. III. ch. 6.) negat,—sed illam exosculationem, quae saepe cernitur,\r\nqualem in columbis, esse. (Aristotle denies this,—but adds that there\r\nis the same billing, which is often noticed, as with doves). Hence also\r\n_Martial_, bk. XIV. Epigr. 74.,\r\n\r\n    Corve salutator, quare fellator haberis?\r\n      In caput intravit mentula nulla tuum.\r\n\r\n(You raven that salute your mate, why are you thought to be a\r\n_fellator_?

And\r\nindeed you live with us, _but you sleep in Phoenicia_, and though no\r\nchild of Semelé, are thigh-bred).\r\n\r\n[62] In particular it is the following Epigram in _Brunck’s_ Analecta\r\nthat has given occasion to this explanation:\r\n\r\n    Ἀλφειοῦ στόμα φεῦγε· φιλεῖ κόλπους Ἀρεθούσης.\r\n      _πρηνὴς ἐμπίπτων ἁλμυρὸν ἐς πέλαγος._\r\n\r\n(Fly the Alpheus’ mouth; he loves the bosom of Arethusa, _falling\r\nheadlong into the salt sea_). Forbiger might have further cited the\r\nfollowing passage from _Aristophanes_, Knights 1086, 87.,\r\n\r\n    ΑΛ. Καὶ γὰρ ἐμοὶ καὶ γῆς καὶ τῆς ἐρυθρᾶς γε θαλάσσης\r\n    χὤτι γ’ἐν Ἐκβατάνοις δικάσεις, _λείχων_ ἐπίπαστα.\r\n\r\n(Verily for me you shall be judge over earth and the Red Sea to boot\r\nand all the realm of Ecbatana, _licking up_ comfit-cakes,—? pickles).\r\nHere ἐπίπαστα is, as probably also in v. 103., the Salgama (pickles\r\nin brine) of _Ausonius_, Epigr. 125.; which moreover affords at any\r\nrate a partial explanation of the passage in _Pollux_, Onomast. bk.\r\nVI. ch. 9. p. 61., bk. X. ch. 24. p. 96. Still, even if according to\r\nthis _Phoenicia_ were used in the sense of the genital organs of women\r\nat time of menstruation, it by no means follows that φοινικίζειν meant\r\n_only_ to have dealings with women in menstruation, any more than it\r\ndoes that it is identical with καταμηνίου πίνων (drinking of menstrual\r\nblood), as it has been shown just above not to be.

But\r\nby ἐρυσίβη is signified _mildew_, _blight_, _smut on grain_, the same\r\nthing therefore as the Romans called _rubigo_ or _robigo_, on which\r\n_Servius_, on Virg. Georg. I. 151., has the following observation:\r\nRobigo genus est vitii, quo culmi pereunt, quod a rusticanis calamitas\r\ndicitur. Hoc autem genus vitii ex nebula nasci solet, cum _nigrescunt\r\net consumuntur_ frumenta. Inde Robigus deus et sacra eius septimo\r\nKalendas Maias Robigalia appellantur. Sed _haec abusive_ robigo\r\ndicitur; nam _proprie robigo est_, ut Varro dicit, _vitium obscoenae\r\nlibidinis quod ulcus vocatur: id autem abundantia et superfluitate\r\nhumoris_ solet nasci, quae Graece σατυρίασις dicitur. (_Robigo_ is a\r\nsort of blight, that kills the corn-stalks, which is spoken of as a\r\n_disaster_ by the peasants. Now this kind of blight commonly springs\r\nfrom a mist or exhalation, the crops blackening and being burnt up.\r\nHence the god Robigus, and his feast-day on the seventh day before\r\nthe Kalends of May (April 24.), known as the Robigalia. But this is\r\ncalled _robigo_ only by a misnomer; for properly speaking _robigo_\r\nis, as Varro says, a vitiation due to abominable licentiousness and\r\nis called an ulcer, and it commonly springs from that abundance and\r\nover-copiousness of the humour, which in Greek is called Satyriasis).\r\nThese words are for our purpose pose of the highest importance,\r\nteaching us as they do, that _a distinctive form of ulceration, that\r\nthe patient had brought on himself by sexual excesses, was not only\r\nfamiliar among the Romans_ but actually bore the _special_ name of\r\n_robigo_. It must have displayed a distinctive redness, and have\r\nconsumed the parts affected similarly to the smut or rust of grain,\r\nor the rust of iron. It is surely a sufficient indication to call the\r\nchancre-ulcer a blight, a burning: Comp. anthrax, carbo (malignant\r\npustule, carbuncle). To this day in Germany it is vulgarly said of any\r\none attacked by the primary forms of Venereal disease, “the man has\r\nburned himself”. _Festus_, (edit. Dacier p. 451.) says: _Robum_ rubro\r\ncolore et quae rufo significare, at bovem quoque rustici appellant,\r\nmanifestum est, unde et _materia quae plurimas venas eius coloris\r\nhabet_ dicta est rubor, (_Robus_ clearly indicates things of a red\r\nor reddish colour,—now countrymen even speak of an ox as _robus_;\r\nhence _any substance having manifold veins of this colour_ is called\r\n_rubor_). Now such is habitually the case with the penis attacked by\r\nphimosis or paraphimosis and under the morbid condition of constant\r\nerection (Satyriasis) superinduced by these. Again this shows us the\r\nreason why Priapus is so frequently called “_ruber_ hortorum custos”\r\n(the _red_ keeper of gardens),—_Priapeia_ Praef. 5.; and why he is\r\nsaid, “_Ruber_ sedere cum _rubente_ fascino,” (to sit, _red_ with his\r\n_ruddy_ verge),—_Horace_, Odes 84. Sat. I. 8. 5. Now as the blight in\r\ngrain was regarded specially as a consequence of the dew (mil_dew_),\r\nand _ros_ (dew) again is used in the sense of the male semen, as well\r\nas for the moisture secreted in the female vagina during coition, we\r\nmight draw yet another analogy from this, and at the same time a proof\r\nof the _verecundia loquentium_ (shamefacedness in speech),—p. 43.,\r\nof the _old_ Romans. Thus it would seem the Greeks too indicated by\r\ntheir φθινὰς the same thing as the Romans by _robigo_. That it was a\r\nhuman disease, is clearly enough shown by the passage from Pollux,\r\nand besides we can see it was so from another in _Plutarch_ in his\r\nLife of Galba (ch. 21.), where he says: Τιγελλῖνον μὲν οὐ πολὺν ἔτι\r\nβιώσεσθαι φάσκοντος· χρόνον, ὑπὸ _φθινάδος νόσου_ δαπανώμενον, (For he\r\nsaid that Tigellinus would not live much longer, being exhausted by a\r\nwasting disease),—a quotation proving at the same time the deadliness\r\nof the malady. Once more, _Hesychius_ has for φθινὰ also φοινία,\r\nsaying, _φοινία_. ἐρυσίβη (φοινία: red blight, and as the adjective\r\ncorresponding would necessarily be φοινικίος or φοινίκινος, it follows\r\nthat φοινικίη νόσος and φθινικὴ νόσος,—φθινικὴ being the adjective\r\nfrom φθινὴ or φθινὰς, (which however would more strictly speaking be\r\nφθινακή), would mean exactly the same thing, viz. an “Ulcus rubrum et\r\nrodens ex coitu cum foeda muliere natum” (red eating ulcer, coming from\r\ncoition with an unclean woman), the fatal event of which affection\r\nwas a matter of common observation among the Ancients. Now if this\r\ninterpretation is the right one in the passage of Hippocrates, it is\r\nclear that λεῦκαι were the consequences of this malady, and accordingly\r\nwe should have a proof that in Antiquity, no less than in modern\r\ntimes, primary ulcers not only preceded secondary affections of the\r\nskin, but were actually _recognized as such_. However as the proofs\r\nfor this _aperçu_ are still too fragmentary on the side of the ancient\r\nPhysicians, we must suspend our immediate judgement on the point, and\r\ncontent ourselves for the present with saying, that φοινικίη νοῦσος\r\nstood originally in the text in the sense of _cunnilingere_ (to be a\r\n_cunnilingue_), whereas a later inquirer put φθινικὴ into its place,\r\ninasmuch as in his time their meanings had become identical as that\r\nof a bodily ailment, and so _the consequence_ of the vice instead of\r\nthe vice itself found its way even into the text. For granted φθινὰς\r\nhas the meaning of _robigo_ (blight), there is no doubt this only came\r\nto be the case as late as in the time of the Alexandrine critics.\r\nBesides this, φοινικιστὴς is also found in the _Etymologicum Magnum_\r\nfor _Cunnilingus_; we read: γλωττοκομεῖον, ἐν ᾧ οἱ αὐληταὶ ἀπετίθεσαν\r\nτὰς γλώττας· εἴρηται δὲ καὶ τὸ _γυναικεῖον αἰδοῖον_ ὑπὸ Εὐβούλου\r\n_φοινικιστὴν_ σκώπτοντος· (γλωττοκομεῖον, tongue-hole, place in which\r\nfluteplayers insert their tongues); _the female privates_ also called\r\nso by Eubulus, making a scoff at the φοινικιστὴς,—_cunnilingue_). The\r\n_Etymologicum Magnum_ further has as synonyms for _cunnilingere_:\r\n_γλωττοστροφεῖν_, περιλαλεῖν καὶ στωμύλλεσθαι· _γλωττοδεψεῖν_,\r\nαἰσχρουργεῖν (_to ply the tongue_: to talk excessively, to babble;\r\n_to work or soften with the tongue_: to do obscenely), and for\r\n_cunnilingus_, _γλώσσαργον_, στόμαργον (_tongue-busy_: mouth-busy).\r\n\r\n[74] _Hippocrates_, περὶ παθῶν, edit. Kühn Vol. II. p. 409.\r\nIt is true this Work is reckoned among the spurious ones, and _Galen_\r\n(Vol. XI. p. 63.) ascribes it to _Polybius_.\r\n\r\n[75] _Aristophanes_, Acharnians 271.\r\n\r\n    Πολλῷ γὰρ ἐσθ’ ἥδιον, ὦ Φαλῆς Φαλῆς\r\n    κλέπτουσαν εὑρόνθ’ ὡρικὴν ὑληφόρον,\r\n    τὴν Στρυμοδώρου Θρᾷτταν ἐκ τοῦ Φελλέως,\r\n    μέσην λαβόντ’ ἄραντα, καταβαλόντα καταγιγαρτίσαι·\r\n\r\n(For ’tis much pleasanter, Phales, Phales! when you have found a\r\nblooming woodcutter girl filching wood, say Strymodorus’ Thracian maid\r\nfrom Phelleus, to take her round the middle and lift her up and throw\r\nher down and take the kernel right away),—where perhaps we should read\r\nΣτυμοδώρου for Στρυμοδώρου.

(But in the case of _lichenes_, scabs, on the chin the malady\r\nis most troublesome. Now it brings on itchings and a critical condition\r\nof the afflicted and no small danger; for it creeps sometimes over\r\nthe whole face, and _attacks the eyes_, and generally is productive\r\nof the _most utter disfigurement_. Wherefore physicians should devote\r\nmore than ordinary care to its treatment, watching _the crises of the\r\nmalady, and the intervals, and judging from the symptoms that have\r\nbecome chronic such as have but just broken out_, on the appearance of\r\nwhich it will be expedient to exhibit siccative medicines. On the other\r\nhand when _it has resolved itself into the itch or leprosy_, exhibit\r\ncathartics in combination with the siccatives). The same is contributed\r\nalso by _Aëtius_, Tetrab.

In the Wasps, 1280-1283,\r\n_Aristophanes_ says, speaking of the same Ariphrades:\r\n\r\n    Εἶτ’ Ἀριφράδην πολύ τι θυμοσοφικώτατον,\r\n    ὃν τινά ποτ’ ὤμοσε μαθόντα παρὰ μηδενὸς,\r\n    ἀλλ’ ἀπὸ σοφῆς φύσεος αὐτόματον ἐκμαθεῖν\r\n    γλωττοποιεῖν εἰς τὰ πορνεῖ’ εἰσιόνθ’ ἑκάστοτε\r\n\r\n(Then Ariphrades, much more ingenious-clever, who he swore without\r\never having learnt the trick from any, but all out of his own wisdom,\r\ndiscovered how to work the tongue, going into the brothels everywhere).\r\n\r\nAlso Peace 883-885.:\r\n\r\n    ΤΡ. τίς; ΟΙΚ. ὅστις; Ἀριφράδης,\r\n    ἄγειν παρ’ αὑτὸν ἀντιβολῶν. ΤΡ. Ἀλλ', ὦ μέλε,\r\n    τὸν ζωμὸν αὐτῆς προσπεσὼν ἐκλάψεται.\r\n\r\n(_Trygaeus._ Who? _Servant._ Who? why Ariphrades, begging to bring her\r\nto him. _Trygaeus._ But, dear man, he will fall on her, and lick up her\r\nbroth).\r\n\r\n[96] _Anthologia Graeca_, cum versione Latina _Hugonis Grotii_,\r\nedita ab H. de Bosch (_Greek Anthology_, with Latin version by _Hugo\r\nGrotius_, edit. H. de Bosch) Utrecht 1795. 4to., Vol. I. p. 38. bk. II.\r\nTit. 5. Epigr. 9. _Brunck’s_ Analecta, Vol. III. p. 165. Epigr. 76.\r\nHere too should be quoted the following Epigram (_Brunck’s_ Analecta,\r\nVol. II. p. 386. Anthology, bk. II. Tit. 5. Epigr. 8.) of _Ammianus_,\r\nwhich at the same time speaks for the general meaning of _licking_:\r\n\r\n    Οὐχ ὅτι τὸν κάλαμον λείχεις, διὰ τοῦτό σε μισῶ,\r\n     Ἀλλ’ ὅτι τοῦτο ποιεῖς καὶ δίχα τοῦ καλάμου.\r\n\r\n(Not because you lick the _reed_, not for this do I abominate you; but\r\nbecause you do so even without the reed). _Ausonius_, Epigr. 126.,\r\nendeavours in another way, by initial letters, to indicate λείχει (he\r\nlicks):\r\n\r\n    Λαῒς, Ἔρως, et Ἴτυς, Χείρων et Ἔρως, Ἴτυς alter\r\n      Nomina siscribis, prima elementa adime:\r\n    Ut facias verbum, quod tu facis, Eune magister:\r\n      Dicere me Latium non decet opprobrium.\r\n\r\n(Λαῒς, Ἔρως, and Ἴτυς, Χείρων and Ἔρως, Ἴτυς repeated,—if you write\r\nthese names, then take off the first letters, you make a verb with them\r\nthat means what you do, learned Eunus; it does not become me to name\r\nthe abomination nation in Latian speech). At the same time we see from\r\nthis that in the IVth. Century, where _Ausonius_ lived at Bordeaux, the\r\nvice of the _cunnilingue_ was still constantly practised and that not\r\neven in secret. Should the words of _Clement of Alexandria_, Paedagog.\r\nII. ch. 8. p. 178., also be brought into connection with this: ἡ δὲ\r\nἐπιτήδευσις τῆς εὐωδίας, δελεάρ ἐστι ῥαθυμίας, πόῤῥωθεν _εἰς λίχνον_\r\nἐπιθυμίον ἐπισπωμένης. (And the cultivation of sweet perfume is a bait\r\nof idleness, indirectly alluring to dainty voluptuousness)? The _male\r\nolere_ (to have an evil smell) held good equally for the _cunnilingue_.\r\n\r\n_Diogenes Laertius_, V. 65., quotes verses of _Crates_, where we\r\nread: οὔτε _λίχνος_, πόρνης ἐπαγγελλόμενος παρῇσι (nor dainty desire,\r\nproclaimed on the cheeks of a harlot); the same occur also in _Clement\r\nof Alexandria_, loco citato ch. 10. Finally yet another quotation, from\r\n_Martial_ (XI. 59.), should come in here; he says to a pathic:\r\n\r\n    At tibi nil faciam: sed lota mentula laeva\r\n    λειχάζειν cupidae dicet avaritiae,\r\n\r\n(But to _you_ I will do no harm; nay! rather shall my member, when\r\nyour left hand has done its work and been washed, say to your grasping\r\navarice,—now lick, fellate, me). This passage has been misunderstood by\r\nmost of the commentators, because they chose to read _lana_ (woollen\r\ncloth) for _laeva_ (the left hand), or else thought to find here a\r\nreference to manustupration (masturbation with the hand). But really\r\nit means nothing more than that the poet declares he will resort to\r\n_irrumation_, after his mentula (member) has been washed with the left\r\nhand, [the Latin cannot mean this; _lotā_ is ablative case, and must\r\nbe taken with _laevā_. _Transl._],—a usage to which we shall come back\r\nagain subsequently; but which is at once clearly authenticated by a\r\nfragment of _Lucilius_, where we read:\r\n\r\n    Laeva lacrimas mutoni absterget amica.\r\n\r\n(With the left hand his mistress wipes the tears from his penis).\r\n\r\n[97] _Galen_, Isagoge ch. 18. (edit. Kühn Vol. XIV. 779).\r\n\r\n[98] _Galen_, loco citato ch. 13. pp. 657, 758.\r\n\r\n[99] _Plato_, Phaedo p. 81 A., οἱ ἀφικομένη ὑπάρχει αὐτῇ εὐδαίμονι\r\nεἶναι, πλάνης καὶ ἀγνοιας καὶ φόβων καὶ _ἀγρίων ἐρώτων_ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων\r\nκακῶν τῶν ἀνθρωπείων ἀπηλλαγμένῃ. (So having come there, the soul is\r\nin a state of assured happiness being free of error and ignorance and\r\nfear, and _fierce passions_ and the other ills of mankind).\r\n\r\n[100] _Plutarch_, De solert. anim. p. 972 D., _Ἔρωτες_ δὲ πολλῶν οἱ μὲν\r\nἄγριοι καὶ περιμανεῖς γεγόνασιν, οἱ δὲ ἔχοντες οὐκ ἀπάνθρωπον ὡραϊσμόν.\r\n(But for the passions of many, some are naturally fierce and frantic,\r\nbut there are others again that show no anti-social effeminacy). The\r\n_Etymologicum Magnum_ says: ἄγριοι οἱ παιδεράσται, ἤτοι _ὅτι ἄγριόν\r\nἐστι τὸ πάθος_ ἡ παιδεραστία. (wild,—means the paederasts, that is,\r\nbecause the _passion of paederastia is a wild one_). Perhaps too the\r\nphrase of Theocritus is referable to the same: ἄγριον, ἄγριον ἕλκος\r\nἔχει κατὰ μηρὸν Ἄδωνις (a savage, savage wound has Adonis in the thigh).\r\n\r\n[101] In _Hesychius_ occurs also the form ἀγριοψωρία (malignant\r\nitch). Whether the latter is connected with our subject, technical\r\ninvestigations must inform us. The passing over of Mentagra into Psora\r\n(Itch) points that way.\r\n\r\n[102] Willian, “Die Hautkrankheiten” (Skin-Diseases), transl. by F.\r\nFriese, Breslau 1794. 4to., Vol. 1. pp. 29 and 32.\r\n\r\n[103] _Paulus Aegineta_, De re Med. bk. IV. ch. 3., ἀγρίους δὲ\r\nκαλοῦσι λειχήνας τοὺς ὑπὸ τῶν μετρίως ξηραινόντων οὐδὲν ὀνιναμένους.\r\nὑπὸ δὲ τῶν σφοδρῶς παροξύνοντας. (now they call _malignant lichens_\r\nthose which get no benefit from the milder siccatives, and are actually\r\naggravated by the more violent).\r\n\r\n[104] _Oribasius_, De morb. curat., edit. Eunap. bk. III. ch.\r\n59., in Steph. collect. p. 637., Ergo quibus nihil affertur auxilii\r\nab iis medicamentis quae mediocriter siccant et exacerbantur ab iis\r\nquae siccant vehementer, eas λειχῆνας ἄγριους vocant. (Accordingly such\r\n_lichens_ as are in no way benefited by remedies that are moderate\r\nsiccatives, and are aggravated by those that are violent ones, these\r\nthey call λειχῆνας ἀγρίους (malignant lichens)).\r\n\r\n[105] _Jöhrens_, in his Dissertation already cited speaks\r\nthus on the subject (p. 47): “De feminis, cum suavia maritorum evitare\r\nnequiverint, quomodo ab ista infectione liberae evaserint, maius\r\nrestat dubium: nos opinamur, cum viri barbam saepius radi soliti\r\nfuerint, ea propter patentibus a novacula poris virulentum illud\r\nfermentum aut incentivum toxicum facilis sese insinuare et characterem\r\nsuum imprimere; imberbes contra feminas, glabritie cutis resistente\r\n_porisque minus patulis_, sospitari potuisse.” (In the case of women,\r\nwhen they have been unable to avoid the caresses of husbands, it\r\nremains very doubtful how they have got off free from this infection.\r\nOur own opinion is that as men have always been accustomed to have the\r\nbeard shaved frequently, for this reason the pores being opened more\r\nwidely by the action of the razor, that virulent ferment and active\r\npoison creeps in more easily and produces its characteristic effect. On\r\nthe other hand women being beardless, the baldness of the skin offering\r\nan obstacle and the _pores being less open_, have been able to escape).\r\n\r\n[106] However this did happen in isolated cases, as is shown\r\nby the example of Philaenis, who indeed was a Tribad properly, in\r\n_Martial_, bk. VII. Epigr. 67.,\r\n\r\n    Post haec omnia cum libidinatur,\r\n    Non fellat, putat hoc parum virile.\r\n    Sed plane medias vorat puellas.\r\n    Di mentem tibi dent tuam, Philaeni,\r\n    Cunnum lingere quae putas virile.\r\n\r\n(After all these indulgences when she still feels lustful, she does not\r\n_fellate_, this she deems unmanly; she just mouths girls’ middles. The\r\ngods give you your desire, Philaenis, you who think it a _manly_ vice\r\nto act the cunnilingue). Comp. bk. IV. Epigr. 41. But it was always a\r\nvery exceptional thing to find this vice practised among women; in fact\r\n_Juvenal_, Sat. II. 47-49., denies it altogether:\r\n\r\n            Non erit ullum\r\n    Exemplum in nostro tam detestabile sexu,\r\n    Taedia non lambit Cluviam, nec Flora Catullam.\r\n\r\n(No such detestable example is to be found in our sex,—Taedia does not\r\nlick Cluvia, nor Flora Catulla).\r\n\r\n[107] It is a surprising circumstance that the words _basium_,\r\n_basiare_, _basiator_ (kiss, to kiss, kisser) appear only to have\r\ncome into use by the Romans from the time of Catullus onwards, and\r\nare found almost exclusively in Martial, Juvenal and the still later\r\nPetronius, so coinciding with a period in which dissoluteness of morals\r\nhad reached the highest pitch among the Romans. Some would derive the\r\nword _basium_ from βάζω, loqui, (to speak); so perhaps it may have been\r\nused in a similar way to narrare (to tell) in _Martial_ (III. 84.) in\r\nthe sense of _cunnilingere_. Βάζω, βαίνω, βεινῶ and βινῶ (to speak,\r\nto go, to have sexual intercourse) seem all to have one and the same\r\nstem. The second of the two Epigrams of _Martial_ quoted in the text\r\nreminds us almost involuntarily of the first Tarsica of Chrysostom.\r\nApparently _basium_ and _basiare_ always imply a _vicious kiss_, to\r\n_kiss viciously_, in a general way. Hence _Martial_, XI. 62., Mediumque\r\nmavult basiare quam summum, (And she had rather kiss his middle than\r\nhis head). _Petronius_, Sat., Ultime cinaedus supervenit,—extortis\r\nnos clunibus cecidit, modo basiis olidissimis inquinavit. (Finally a\r\n_cinaedus_ appeared,—he made at us with writhing buttocks, and anon\r\nbefouled us with most evil-smelling kisses).\r\n\r\n[108] _Galen_, loco citato, mentions in particular the\r\nphysicians. _Crito_ and _Pamphilus_, who lived in the reign of\r\nDomitian, and who accordingly were contemporaries of _Martial’s_, as\r\npre-eminently successful in the treatment of _mentagra_.\r\n\r\n[109] Also _Hippocrates_, De aere aq. et loc. p. 549. Vol. I.\r\ned. Kühn, says: ἀλλὰ τὴν _ἡδονὴν κρατέειν_, διότι πολύμορφα γίνεται\r\nτὰ ἐν τοῖς θηρίοις· περὶ μὲν οὖν _Αἰγυπτίων_ καὶ Λιβύων οὕτως ἔχειν\r\nμοι δοκεῖ. (But that _love of pleasure_ gained the mastery, inasmuch\r\nas the passions in beasts are of many forms; now with regard to the\r\n_Egyptians_ and Libyans this seems to me to be the case).\r\n\r\n[110] _Julian_, Caesares, in “Opera Omnia” Paris 1630. 4to.,\r\nPt.

II. 56., Graeco\r\nnomine lichenes appellatur, quod vulgo mentagram appellant, et est\r\nvitium, quod per totam faciem solet serpere, oculis tantum immunibus;\r\ndescendit vero in collum et pectus ac manus, foedat cutem; eosque,\r\nqui sic vexantur, osculari non convenit, quoniam contactus eorum\r\nperniciosus fore perhibetur. (In Greek nomenclature the name _lichenes_\r\nis given to what the common people call _mentagra_, and is a malady\r\nthat as a rule creeps over the whole face, the eyes alone being\r\nunaffected. But it also goes down to the neck and breast and hands,\r\ndisfiguring the skin. It is not right for those so afflicted to kiss,\r\nfor their contact is said to be injurious.)—_Marcellus Empiricus_, De\r\nmed. liber ch. 19., Ad lichenem sive mentagram, quod vitium neglectum\r\nsolet per totam faciem et per totum corpus serpere et plures homines\r\ninquinare.

(For _lichen_ or\r\n_mentagra_, a malady which if neglected will creep over the whole face\r\nand the whole body, and disfigures many men. Indeed Soranus a Physician\r\nat one time sold his professional services in Aquitania to two hundred\r\npatients suffering from this disease).\r\n\r\n[117] _Marcellus Empiricus_, De medicam. liber ch. 19.,\r\nAdversum _Elephantiasin, quod malum plerumque a facie auspicatur,\r\nprimumque oritur quasi lenticulis variis et inaequalibus, cute alba,\r\nalibi tenui, plerisque locis dura et quasi scabida et ad postremum sic\r\nincrescit ut ossibus, caro adstricta, tumescentibus primum digitis\r\natque articulis indurescat_. Hic morbus peculiariter Aegyptiorum\r\npopulis notus est nec solum in vulgus extremum, sed etiam reges ipsos\r\nfrequenter irrepsit, unde adversus hoc malum solia ipsis in balneo\r\nrepleta humano sanguine parabantur.

The ashes therefore of a burned\r\nweasel and the blood of the corresponding beast, that is to say the\r\nelephant, were mixed together and used as an ointment in the remedial\r\ntreatment of bodies so afflicted).—_Actuarius_, Meth. med. bk.

On diseases of the _Face_, reads: Ad affectus eminentes, _facieique\r\npruritus ac principum elephantiae_, (For the principal affections,\r\n_itchings of the face and the beginnings of elephantiasis_).

The author believes the Morbus Campanus to have\r\nbeen identical with Sycosis or θύμιον (large wart), but to have had no\r\nconnection with the _Lues Venerea_ (Venereal Contagion).\r\n\r\n[120] Noteworthy is the explanation of _Isidore_, Etymol. bk.\r\nIV. ch. 9. 17., _Oscedo_ est, qua infantum ora exulcerantur, dicta\r\na languore oscitantium. (_Oscedo_ is a complaint whereby children’s\r\nmouths become ulcerated, so called from the languor of those gaping);\r\nthe latter part is unintelligible. Were these _oscitantes_ (gapers)\r\npossibly _fellators_? _Lucian_, Pseudolog. ch. 27. says of Timarchus,\r\nἀναπετάσας τὸ στόμα, καὶ ὡς ἔνι πλατύτατον κεχηνὼς, ἠνείχου τυφλούμενος\r\nὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τὴν γνάθον.

XI. 15.\r\n\r\n[122] _Luxus_ in the sense of sexual excess occurs not\r\nunfrequently in ancient writers, e. g. in _Tacitus_, Hist. IV. 14.,\r\n_Suetonius_, Nero 29. _Capua luxurians_ is well known from the\r\nhistory of Hannibal. It is worth noting that _Paracelsus_ gives the\r\nname _luxus_ to Venereal disease; he says, De causis et origine luis\r\nGallicae, (Of the Causes and Origin of the French Contagion), bk. I.\r\nch. 5.: _Luxus_ autem nomen quod attinet, illud ab influentia, id\r\nest, efficiente causa desumptum esse intelligendum est. Est autem\r\n_luxus_ irritatio quaedam ac titillatus spermatis, ad perficiendum\r\nactum venereum, a morbis in corpore latentibus causata, itaque Veneris\r\nimpressione a morbo in actu ipso facta, tum ex vulgari luxu fit\r\n_luxus morbi_ seu _morbidus_. Proinde _luxus_ hic non naturalis sed\r\n_Satyricus_ dicendus erit. (But _luxus_ the name that is applied to\r\nit, this name must be understood as being taken from the influencing\r\ncircumstance or efficient cause. Now _luxus_ is a certain irritation or\r\ntickling of the seed, leading to the performance of the Venereal act\r\nand caused by diseases latent in the body, and so a strong motion of\r\nlove being made in consequence of the disease in the act itself, then\r\nfrom the common expression _luxus_, is formed _luxus_ of the disease,\r\nor morbid _luxus_. It follows this _luxus_ will have to be called not\r\nnatural, but _Satyric luxus_).\r\n\r\n[123] Possibly a _double entendre_ lurks even in the _ad\r\npugnam venere_ (they came to the fight). _Festus_, under the word,\r\nsays: Osculana pugna in proverbio, quo significabatur victos vincere,\r\n(An Osculan—otherwise Asculan,—fight a proverbial saying that signified\r\nthe vanquished being victorious).

Epigr. 105.\r\n\r\n[125] It is worthy of note that _Rhazes_, Elchavi seu\r\nContinens, Brescia 1486. fol., p. 276., mentions certain ulcers on\r\nthe verge, that come from _ascensio mulieris supra virum_ (the woman\r\ngetting on the man)!\r\n\r\n[126] _Seneca_, Nat. Quaest. bk.

I. ch. 23., ἵππος δούρειος μηχάνημα εἰς\r\nδιάλυσιν τοῦ τείχους (a horse of wood an engine for the destruction\r\nof the wall). Further ἵππος (horse) is used as a nickname for a lewd\r\nman. The Scholiast on _Oribasius_, Collect. Med. bk. XXIV. ch. 8. in\r\n_A. Mai_, Auct. Class. e vatican. codd. edit. Vol. IV. p. 30. mentions\r\nἵππος πύργος (horse tower), but in what sense we have not been able to\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n[128] _Mutilus_, κολοβὸς, κόλος, the special expression\r\nfor beasts that have lost one or both horns.

(As to the Campanian disease, this is either foulness of\r\nmouth, or arrogance. For the Campanians are said to be foul, arrogant.\r\nSo let us take it as foul. In another sense, the Campanians, who\r\nwere also called Oscans are filthy of mouth. For which reason we say\r\n_Osceni_—obscene). _Lambinus_ expresses himself yet more distinctly:\r\nCampani, qui antea Osci dicebantur, habiti sunt ore impuro atque\r\nincesto; τοῦτ’ ἔστι τῷ στόματι αἰσχροποιοῦντες καὶ λεσβιάζοντες,\r\nmorbum igitur animi intellige, ut Od. I. 37. (The Campanians,\r\nwho were previously called Oscans, were considered of impure and\r\nabominable mouth; that is to say as acting uncleanly with the mouth or\r\n_Lesbianizing_; understand therefore a mental disease, as in Od. I.\r\n37.). The Latin _Morbus_ is frequently so used.\r\n\r\n[130] _Homer_, Iliad XI. 233.\r\n\r\n          (κἀκείνου)\r\n    Ἀτρείδης μὲν ἅμαρτε, παραὶ δέ οἱ ἐτράπετ’ ἔγχος·\r\n    αἰχμὴ δ’ ἐξεσύθη παρὰ νείατον ἀνθερεῶνα.\r\n\r\n(Now him Atreides missed, and his spear was turned aside past him,\r\nand the point sped rushing past the very edge of his chin). Similarly\r\n_Diogenes_ according to Diogenes Laertius’ (VI. 53.) report parodied the\r\nHomeric verse (Iliad X. 282): “No sleeper must drive a spear through\r\nyour back,” as he woke a handsome youth, who lay incautiously asleep.\r\n\r\n[131] In _Festus_, under the word bigenera (hybrids), we read:\r\n_Cicursus_ ex apro et scropha domestica, (_Cicursus_ from the wildboar\r\nand the domestic sow).

Hoc\r\ntantum dicam, aenigma illud, quod in Clodii Metelli uxorem iactum\r\nputant: In triclinio Coa, in cubiculo Nola, respicere ad hanc Lesbiam\r\net Campanam foeditatem.

The riddle is found in _Quintilian_,\r\nInstit. Orat. VIII. 6.; but is differently explained in Forberg, loco\r\ncitato p. 283. He says: _Coam_ dici, quod voluerit in triclinio coire,\r\n_Nolam_, quod noluerit in cubiculo, (that she was called a _Coan_,\r\nbecause willing to have intercourse on the banquet-couch, a Nolan,\r\nbecause unwilling to do so in the bed-chamber), that is to say, Clodia\r\nwould satisfy her lust only publicly, not in private.\r\n\r\n[134] _Hier.

Perhaps too the expression κίναδος belongs in this connection,\r\nof which the Scholiast on Aristophanes, Clouds 447., says, εἶδός τι\r\nθηρίου.—κακοῦργος οὖν, φησὶν, ὡς ἀλώπηξ, τινὲς δὲ κίναδος ζῶον μικρὸν\r\n_τὸ αἰδοῖον εἰςσωθοῦν καὶ ἐξωθοῦν_. (a kind of beast,—mischievous,\r\nthey say, as a fox, but others say κίναδος means a little animal that\r\n_forces its way in and out of the privates_). Suidas brings forward the\r\nsame statement, under the word κίναδος. From the connection in which\r\n_Democritus_ mentions it in Stobaeus’ Sermon. 42., περὶ κιναδέων τε καὶ\r\nἑρπετέων (Of κίναδοι and Creeping Things), _Schmeider_ in his Lexicon\r\nsupposes it to signify _snakes_ particularly.

(Indeed in a hot climate,\r\nwhen the secretions from the skin, from the sebaceous glands, from the\r\nrecesses of the vagina, increase in abundance and in foulness, it is\r\nnot surprising that the menstrual blood, remaining for a time as it\r\ndoes in the regions contiguous to the anus, these regions being in a\r\nstate of sur-excitation, quickly acquires an evil smell). So _Haller_\r\ntoo says (Elem. Physiolog. Vol. VII. pt. II. p. 146.), _Ex Asia\r\nvidetur opinio de menstrui sanguinis foetida et venenata natura ad nos\r\npervenisse_, et per medicos potissimum Arabes ad Europaeos transiisse.\r\nIn calidissimis certe regionibus, si ad aestuosum aerem immundities\r\naccesserit, non repugnat, sanguinem in loco calente, in vicinia faecum\r\nalvinarum retentum, acrem fieri et foetire.... _Lentorem aliquem possit\r\nmucus admistus addidisse._ (_It is from Asia that the opinion as to the\r\nfetid and poisonous character of menstrual blood would seem to have\r\ncome to us_, being transmitted mainly by the Arab physicians to those\r\nof Europe. No doubt in very hot climates, if dirty habits be added to\r\nthe extreme heat of the atmosphere, there is nothing at all unlikely\r\nin the blood, retained as it is in a hot locality, in close proximity\r\nto the faeces in the bowels, growing sour and smelling foul.... _A\r\ncertain viscous quality may very well have been added by the admixture\r\nof mucous discharge_). What has been observed as to the injuriousness\r\nof menstrual blood by our predecessors since _Pliny_ (Hist. Nat. VII.\r\n15. XIX. 10.

Versuche und Beobachtungen,—Physiological\r\nInvestigations and Observations, transl. from the English, Leipzig\r\n1778. 8vo., pp. 50-54.) long ago maintained. It is more probable\r\nhowever that any slight putrefactive action occurring is in each case\r\ndue not so much to this as to the _acid quality_ of the menstrual\r\nblood, which in conjunction with the acid vaginal mucus undergoes\r\na kind of acetous fermentation in the vagina, the product of which\r\nhas thus a corrosive effect. _Retzius_ indeed has lately not only\r\nfound menstrual blood to possess an exceedingly acid reaction, but\r\neven proved that it contains free phosphoric and lactic acids.

Even _Astruc_, the eager advocate\r\nof the American origin of Venereal disease, says (Vol. I. p. 92.):\r\nSane constat in hac nostra Europa, quae magis temperata est, si cum\r\nmenstruatis res habeatur, balanum et praeputium leviore phlogosi\r\naut superficiariis pustulis, quae tamen brevi cessant, _plerumque_\r\naffici. Quanto graviora ergo iis impendere credendum est, quos in\r\ncalidiore et aestuante climate misceri cum foeminis non pudet, dum\r\nillis menses actu fluunt natura acerrimi et quasi virosi. Ideo forsan\r\nfactum est, ut medici Arabes, qui regiones calidiores incolebant,\r\nquam Graeci et Latini, et primi et saepe disseruerint de pustulis et\r\nulceribus virgae, oriundis ex coitu cum foeda muliere, hoc est (?),\r\ncum muliere menstruata. (It is an undoubted fact that in this Europe\r\nof ours, though enjoying a more temperate climate, if intercourse is\r\nhad with women during menstruation, the _glans penis_ and prepuce are\r\n_generally_ attacked by some little inflammation or by superficial\r\npustules, which however soon disappear. What much more serious\r\nconsequences then must we suppose threaten those who in a warmer\r\nclimate, one steaming with heat, are not ashamed to make coition with\r\nwomen, whilst their _menses_ are actually flowing, these being from\r\nthe nature of the case exceedingly acrid and almost poisonous. Perhaps\r\nthis is why the Arab physicians, who lived in warmer countries than the\r\nGreek and Latin practitioners, first and most often treated of pustules\r\nand ulcers of the verge, arising from coition with an unclean woman,\r\nthat is to say (?) with a woman during menstruation).

(for translation see text above). For\r\nκατὰ _τινὰ_ οἰκονομίαν (by a certain providence) we ought probably to\r\nread κατὰ _θινὰν_ or _θείαν_ οἰκονομίαν, a collocation of words\r\nconstantly found in Palladius, and occurring in this very chapter a\r\nfew lines before, in the sense of “by Divine providence”. On the other\r\nhand the words τὰ πρὸς τὸ ἕλκος ἑαυτοῦ διελέγετο are to us absolutely\r\nunintelligible. _Helvetius_ translates the passage: Incidit in coenum\r\nfemineae cupiditatis et cum peccare constituisset cum quadam mima\r\nassidue colloquutus, _ulcus suum aperuit_, (He fell into the mire\r\nof lust after women, and having set his mind on sinning, constantly\r\nconversing with a certain actress, _he opened his sore_. Indeed the\r\nγυναικείη ἐπιθυμία (womanly lust) itself is ambiguous, as strictly\r\nspeaking it points to something unmanly, and if we compare with it\r\nthe γυναικεία νοῦσος (womanly disease) of Dio Chrysostom (p. 209.),\r\nour thoughts cannot but turn to the vice of the pathic,—which however\r\nHero could not very well practise with an actress, and to which he\r\ncould hardly owe an _anthrax_ on the _glans penis_. But ch. 35. shows\r\nus plainly enough that _Palladius_ in using the phrase means lust,\r\nindulgence with women, accomplishing coition. It is related in that\r\nchapter of the Abbot Elias, how he had founded a nunnery, and was\r\nthereupon assailed by violent desire to abuse the nuns; wherefore he\r\nprayed, ἀπόκτεινόν με, ἵνα μὴ ἴδω αὐτὰς θλιβομένας. ἢ _τὸ πάθος_ μου\r\nλάβε, ἵνα αὐτῶν φροντίζω κατὰ λόγον. (Kill me, that I may not see them\r\ntroubled, or else take away my _passion_, that I may look upon them\r\nwith reason and moderation). Thereafter he fell asleep and dreamed the\r\nangels had castrated him, and on waking found indeed that he still\r\npossessed his genitals, but he declared, ὅτι οὐκέτι ἀνέβη εἰς τὴν\r\nκαρδίαν μου πάθος _γυναικὸς ἐπιθυμίας_. (there no more entered into my\r\nheart the passion of _lust after_ women). But now what does τὰ πρὸς τὸ\r\nἕλκος mean? Guided by the general sense, we might take it as meaning\r\nthe genital organs, though we have searched in vain for analogous\r\npassages. But in that case it could be made to apply only to the\r\nfemale genitals or to the rectum, because these only exhibit a breach\r\nof continuity (ἕλκος,—a wound); or else we should have to suppose the\r\nseed to be looked upon in a sort of way as matter discharged, and the\r\nmale genitals, which secrete it, therefore called ἕλκος (a wound), for\r\notherwise the ἑαυτοῦ (his own) cannot be got in. No less uncertain\r\nis the meaning of διελέγετο; “to converse” cannot possibly be taken\r\nas the sense here. _Suidas_ and _Hesychius_ explain διαλέγεσθαι by\r\nσυνουσιάζειν (to associate with). _Pollux_, Onomast. V. 93. περὶ\r\nμίξεως ζώων (On the intercourse of Animals) says, διαλεχθῆναι.—οὐδ’\r\nἡ διάλεξις, ἀλλὰ διειλέχθην αὐτῇ καὶ διειλεγμένος εἰμὶ ὡς Ὑπερίδης.\r\nII. 125. Ὑπερίδης δὲ διειλεγμένος, ἐπ’ ἀφροδισίων. Ἀριστοφάνης δὲ\r\nδιαλέξασθαι ἔφη. (διελεχθῆναι,—not ordinary conversation, but it means\r\n“I had converse with her”, or “I am conversant”, as says Hyperides,\r\nII. 125. Now Hyperides says “conversant with”, speaking of love\r\nintercourse; and Aristophanes “to have converse with”). Comp. Küster\r\nand Brunck on Aristophanes’ Plut. 1083. Moeris p. 131. Abresch, lect.\r\nAristaenet. p. 50. But the meaning of accomplishing coition is implied\r\nalready in προσομιλῶν (associating with), so that διαλέγεσθαι must\r\nhere indicate some other more special circumstance. The Scholiast\r\nof Aristophanes on Lys. 720 interprets διαλέγουσιν by διορύττουσιν\r\n(bore through), penetrate); accordingly we must take διαλέγεσθαι as\r\ndeponent, in which case we should have to read τὰ πρὸς τὸ ἕλκος _αὐτῆς_\r\nδιελέγετο (he penetrated _her_ private parts), and make the τὰ πρὸς\r\nἕλκος refer to the actress and her hymen (or fibula?), just as in the\r\npassage cited from Josephus on p. 315. the expression περὶ τὸ αἰδοῖον\r\n(about the privates) signifies the foreskin. If we would keep ἑαυτοῦ\r\n(his own), then we must take διαλέγομαι in the sense of καθαίρειν (to\r\npurify) (Hesychius says διαλέγειν, ἀνακαθαίρειν,—to purify), and put\r\nin an οὐκ (not),—i. e. he did not purify his genitals. If we keep to\r\nthe meaning of separation, division, we might understand the sentence\r\nas saying that Hero tore apart his foreskin; though really ἕλκος could\r\nscarcely be applied with any propriety to the male genitals at all. For\r\nits being used of the female genitals on the other hand a good analogy\r\nis offered by ἐσχάρα (a scab), which occurs in Aristophanes, Knights\r\n1286. and often elsewhere. Eustathius, on Odyss. p. 1523., says: δῆλον\r\nδ’ ὅτι ἐσχάραν καὶ τὸ γυναικεῖον ἐκάλουν μόριον. (Now it is evident they\r\nused to call the female part ἐσχάρα). However in this case the learned\r\nreader must be left to decide for himself.\r\n\r\n[158] _Leviticus_ ch. 20. v. 18. It is true _Maimonides_ according\r\nto _Selden_, Uxor Hebraica (The Jewish Wife), Frankfurt 1673. 4to.,\r\np. 133., says: At vero si esset mensibus immunda, tametsi deducta\r\nfuerit, _etiam et coitus sit secutus_, nuptiae non perficiebantur.\r\n(But indeed if she were unclean with menstruation, though she had\r\nbeen led forth to a husband’s house, _even if coition had followed_,\r\nthe marriage was not proceeded with)—but in that case of course it\r\nhappened unwittingly; though no doubt it may very well on the other\r\nhand have been done not unfrequently wittingly. _Festus_ explains the\r\nLatin word _imbubinare_ by “menstruo mulierum sanguine inquinare” (to\r\npollute with the menstrual blood of women), which might almost justify\r\nus in conjecturing, that _buboes_ had been observed to originate\r\nfrom intercourse with women during menstruation. _Hippocrates_, De\r\nnatura pueri (On the Bodily Constitution of the Boy), edit. Kühn Vol.\r\nI. p. 390., derives affections of the sort in women from arrested\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\n[159] _Leviticus_ Ch. 15. Want of space forbids our giving this\r\nChapter here; but anyone who will read it through carefully, must\r\neasily see that in it the question is merely of a morbid discharge\r\nfrom the genitals (basar), the duration of which was uncertain. For\r\nthis reason those affected continued still unclean for nine days\r\nafter the cessation of the flux, whereas the man who had encountered\r\nordinary pollution (verse 16.) was unclean only till the evening.\r\nThe Septuagint translators render the flux by ῥύσις (flowing, flux),\r\nthe person affected by the flux γονοῤῥυής (having a flux from the\r\ngenitals), while they say of ordinary pollution, ὡς ἐὰν ἐξέλθῃ ἐξ\r\nαὐτοῦ κοίτη _σπέρματος_ (“if any man’s seed of copulation go out of\r\nhim”). _Astruc_ and others wished to refer the flux from the genitals\r\nto Lepra (Leprosy), but in that case the Leprosy must needs have been\r\npreviously noticeable in the person affected by the flux, and the flux\r\ntherefore been really a symptom. Thus it would have demanded no further\r\nspecial ordinance for purification, as that commanded for Leprosy would\r\nhave been used for it. Again the same would also have occurred, had\r\nthe flux been noticed as _first_ symptom of the Leprosy, for then the\r\nPriest was bound to have confined the person so affected and put him\r\nunder observation, to see whether the other symptoms of Leprosy would\r\nshow themselves as well. But of this there is nothing whatever to be\r\nfound in the writings attributed to Moses, who clearly distinguishes\r\nbetween the flux and Leprosy, as also does the Author of II Samuel III.\r\n29. Speaking generally, no other Author ever mentions the flux as a\r\nconstant or frequent symptom of Leprosy, while _Schilling_ even denies\r\nits occurrence altogether. Comp. _Hensler_, Vom abendl. Aussatze (On\r\nOriental Leprosy), pp. 130, 396.\r\n\r\n[160] _Astruc_, De morbis venereis (Of Venereal diseases), p. 93., Quid\r\nigitur mirum varia, heterogenea, acria multorum virorum semina (et\r\nsmegmata we may add) una confusa, cum acerrimo et virulento menstruo\r\nsanguine mixta, intra uterum aestuantem et olidum spurcissimarum\r\nmulierum coercita, mora, heterogeneitate, calore loci brevi\r\ncomputruisse ac prima morbi venerei semina constituisse, quae in\r\nalios, si qui forsan continentiores erant, contagione dimanavere?...\r\nCum ergo in omnibus terrae locis, _ubi lues venerea antiquitus endemia\r\nfuisse videtur_, eundem aeris fervorem cum pari incolarum impudicitia\r\nconiunctum fuisse manifestum sit, haud inanis inde locus est colligendi\r\nmorbum natura eundem, quo regiones longissime dissitae et inter quas\r\nnulla fuit commercii communio, simili modo infestabantur, a simili\r\ncausarum earundem concursu, in quo tantum convenirent, generatum\r\nolim fuisse et _generari etiamnum_, si indigenae iisdem moribus\r\nvivant. (What is there surprising then in the fact that the various,\r\nheterogeneous, acrid seminal fluids of a number of different men (and\r\nunguents as well, we may add), all confounded together and mixed with\r\nthe exceedingly acrid and virulent menstrual blood, confined within\r\nthe steaming hot and fetid womb of the dirtiest of women, by long\r\ncontinuance in one place, by heterogeneity of components, by the heat\r\nof the locality, should very soon have grown putrid, and so laid the\r\nfirst seeds of Venereal disease,—which then passed on by contagion\r\nto other men, men that were very possibly more self-restrained?...\r\nSo, inasmuch as in all parts of the world, _wherever Venereal disease\r\nappears to have been endemic in Antiquity_, it is plain the same heat\r\nof the atmosphere was united with a similar immorality on the part of\r\nthe inhabitants, there is therefore sufficient ground for concluding\r\nthat the disease, identical in its nature and one whereby regions\r\nfar removed from one another and between which existed no commercial\r\nintercourse were attacked in a like way, was originally produced by a\r\nlike conjunction of identical causes, a conjunction wherein these only\r\nagreed,—and _is still so produced_, supposing the inhabitants to still\r\nlive after the same fashion). _Wizmann_ (loco citato p. 32.) moreover\r\nis of opinion that Venereal disease under the conditions just named\r\noriginates in Turkey to this day _in its true form_.

L’incubation des oeufs que cette mouche deposait\r\nsans cesse dans les plaies ou dans les appareils, étoit favorisée par\r\nla chaleur de la saison, l’humidité de l’atmosphère et la qualité de\r\nla toile à pansement (elle étoit de coton) la seule qu’on ait pu se\r\nprocurer dans cette contrée. La présence de ces vers dans les plaies\r\nparaissait en accélérer la suppuration, causait des demangeaisons\r\nincommodes aux blessés et nous forçait de les panser trois ou quatre\r\nfois le jour. Ces insectes, formés en quelques heures, se développaient\r\navec une telle rapidité, que du jour au lendemain, ils étaient de la\r\ngrosseur d’un tuyau de plume de poulet. On faisait à chaque pansement\r\ndes lotions d’une forte décoction de rhue et de petite sauge, qui\r\nsuffisaient pour les détruire; mais ils se reproduisaient bientot après\r\npar le défaut des moyens propres à écarter l’approche des mouches\r\net à prévenir l’incubation de leurs oeufs. (During the action of\r\nsuppuration, the only inconvenience the wounded met with was from the\r\nworms or larvae of the blue fly, common in Syria. The hatching of the\r\neggs, which this fly was continually depositing in the wounds or their\r\ndressings, was favoured by the heat of the season, the moisture of the\r\natmosphere, and the nature of the material used for bandages. This was\r\ncotton, the only material for the purpose that could be procured in\r\nthat country. The presence of these worms in the wounds appeared to\r\naccelerate their suppuration, caused the wounded men to suffer from\r\ntroublesome itchings and forced us to renew the dressings three or four\r\ntimes a day. These insects, formed in a few hours, developed with such\r\nextraordinary rapidity, that from one day to the next, they reached\r\nthe size of a fowl’s quill. At each dressing lotions were applied\r\nof a strong decoction of rue and dwarf sage, which was effectual in\r\ndestroying them; but they reappeared again very soon afterwards owing\r\nto the want of proper means for preventing the approach of the flies\r\nand hindering the hatching of their eggs).

Yet heaven-sent punishment\r\novertakes him, commencing with his very flesh and going on to assail\r\nthe life. For an incessant suppurative inflammation attacks him in\r\nthe region of the private parts of the body; then later on a wound\r\npenetrating deep in like a fistula and an incurable eating sore\r\naffecting these inmost intestines. Then from these an indescribable\r\nnumber of worms bred, and a corpse-like smell was given off, the whole\r\nbulk of the bodily parts having through high living and under the\r\ninfluence of the disease changed into an exaggerated superfluity of\r\nfat. Then this rotting away, displayed an intolerable and an appalling\r\nspectacle to his attendants; while among his physicians, some finding\r\nthemselves utterly unable to endure the exceeding horribleness of\r\nthe stench, put an end to their lives; while others, the whole bulk\r\nhaving gone to complete rottenness, and the patient in a condition\r\nthat admitted no hope of recovery, being unable to afford any help,\r\nwere cruelly put to death).

This much is certain, that if both sexes are fully developed,\r\nand live chaste, an extensive series of mutually connected pustules may\r\narise, _just as if they were produced by the swelling of the glands\r\nin the skin_.

On the other hand in a cold\r\none, because it is drawn within, it is turned back contrary to the\r\nmotion of its nature, and more often feeds upon the solid parts of the\r\nbody. Again it appears more frequently in a hot region than in a cold\r\none; for in the latter case the surrounding air (driving it within as\r\nit does) hinders the disease from extending to the skin, whereas in\r\nthe former it draws it to the skin and keeps it there).

Meantime compare\r\nwhat _Hensler_, “Vom Abendländischen Aussatze”, (On Oriental Leprosy),\r\npp. 228 sqq., says on the subject.\r\n\r\n[176] _Galen_, Ad Glaucon. de meth. med. II., edit. Kühn Vol. XI.\r\np. 142., says: κατὰ γοῦν τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρειαν _ἐλεφαντιῶσι πάμπολλοι_\r\nδιά τε τὴν δίαιταν καὶ _τὴν θερμότητα τοῦ χωρίου·—ἅτε δὲ θερμοῦ τοῦ\r\nπεριέχοντος ὄντος καὶ ἡ ῥοπὴ τῆς φορᾶς αὐτῶν πρὸς τὸ θέρμα γίνεται_·\r\n(At any rate in the neighbourhood of Alexandria very many persons\r\nsuffer from elephantiasis as well through their mode of life as owing\r\nto _the heat of the locality_;—for indeed as a result of the excessive\r\nheat of the climate, the tendency of their constitution is also towards\r\nheat). In Germany and Mysia he asserts the disease is seldom observed,\r\nand in Scythia almost never.\r\n\r\n[177] Phlyctaenae (blisters) in erysipelas of the uterus are mentioned\r\nby Hippocrates, De ant. mulierum, edit. Kühn II. p. 541. _Galen_, edit.\r\nKühn Vol. XVII. A. p. 358., ἴσθι γὰρ ὅτι τὰ ἐξανθήματα ἐν ταῖς τῆς\r\nμήτρας διαθέσεσιν εἰς τὸ δέρμα ἐκραγέντα σημαίνουσιν ὅτι ἡ φλεγμονὴ\r\nἢ ἐρυσίπελας ἐκ τοῦ ἀποζέοντος καὶ λεπτοῦ αἵματος ἐν ταῖς μήτραις\r\nἐγγίνεται, ὡς ἐν τῷ περὶ γυναικείης φύσεως γέγραπται. (Be assured that\r\nthose eruptions that break out on the skin in certain morbid conditions\r\nof the womb signify that the inflammation or erysipelas proceeds from\r\nthe deficiency and poorness of the blood in the womb, as is stated in\r\nmy Work, On the Female Constitution).\r\n\r\n[178] _Aristotle_, Problem IV. 18.\r\n\r\n[179] _Aëtius_, Tetrab, IV. serm. 1. ch. 122., Novimus quosdam\r\naudaciores qui sibi ipsis testes ferro resecarunt; castratis enim non\r\nin peius malum ipsum procedet. Neque enim temere reperias, inquit\r\nArchigenes, ullum aliquem castratum elephantiasi laborantem, neque item\r\nfacile mulierem. Quare etiam quidam ex confidentioribus medicis manum\r\nadmoverunt, et quotquot sane ex eis ex sectione periculum evaserunt,\r\nper consequentis curationis usum perfecte ab hac maligna affectione\r\nliberati sunt. (We know of some bolder spirits who have amputated their\r\nown testicles with the knife; for after castration the actual evil will\r\nnot then proceed to any worse length. For, says Archigenes, you will\r\nnot readily find any single case of a castrated man suffering from\r\nelephantiasis, nor will you easily discover a woman at all affected by\r\nthis disease. Wherefore, in fact, some of the more daring practitioners\r\nhave operated, and there is no doubt that such of their patients as\r\nescaped the dangerous effects of the operation, have been through\r\nthe employment of subsequent precautions completely freed from this\r\nmalignant complaint). Comp. _Hensler_, “Vom Aussatz”, (On Leprosy),\r\np. 401. With regard to _the immunity of women_, an assertion likewise\r\nmade in connection with _mentagra_ (p. 288), _von Roeser_ writes (loco\r\ncitato p. 67.) referring to Venereal disease: “Above all it is now the\r\ncase in Greece and Turkey that the practising physician,—and I have\r\nbeen assured of the fact by many persons,—exceedingly seldom meets with\r\nsyphilitic female patients in his practice; that yet notwithstanding\r\nthis none of _the sequelæ and different forms of subsequent mischief_\r\nthat are usually found resulting from the disease when every kind of\r\nmedical aid is neglected, are seen in patients of that sex.”—P. 71.,\r\n“Only poison would seem, as a result of the secretive process exerted\r\nby the affected parts of the skin and the mucous membrane, which is\r\nmuch more powerful in women than in men, to be more readily eliminated\r\nfrom the body than is the case with men, so much so indeed that it is\r\nan almost unheard of thing in Egypt to find a female patient under\r\nmedical treatment.”—still this does not justify the conclusion that\r\nwomen _never_ suffered from Venereal disease, as even von Roeser\r\nhimself admits. Again Larrey, loco citato p. 253., actually found\r\nhimself constrained in view of the wide dissemination of the disease\r\namong the French soldiers, to establish a special hospital for infected\r\nwomen, in order to check the spread of the complaint.\r\n\r\n[180] Comp. _Foot_, “Abh. über die Lustseuche” (Treatise on Venereal\r\nDisease), transl. from the English by _H.

II. ch. 13. edit.\r\nKühn p. 180.) can hardly be cited as evidence on the other side in this\r\ncase, as the question there discussed is elephantiasis, not the leprosy\r\nof the Jews at all. Any how we read there: τρίχες ἐν μὲν τῷ παντὶ\r\nπροτεθνήσκουσι, χερσὶ μηροῖσι κνήμῃσι, αὖθις ἥβῃ, γενείοισι ἀραιαὶ,\r\nψεδναὶ δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῇ κεφαλῇ κόμαι· τὸ δὲ μᾶλλον πρόωροι, πολιοὶ καὶ\r\nφαλάκρωσις ἀθρόη· οὐκ εἰς μακρὸν δὲ ἥβη καὶ ἐπιμίμνοιεν παυραὶ τρίχες,\r\nἀπρεπέστεραι τῶν ἀποιχομένων. (Hair dies first in every part, on hands,\r\nthighs, shins; again on pubes and cheeks it becomes thin, and scanty\r\nalso on the head. The locks are prematurely white, and baldness becomes\r\ngeneral; nor is it long before pubes and cheeks are bare, and if a few\r\nscanty hairs should remain, they are uncomely as compared with those\r\nthat have disappeared). Nor would it be any fairer to cite the fact\r\nthat Albinos are covered over the whole body with a fine, white, woolly\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n[183] Already _J. D. Michaelis_, “Fragen an eine Gesellschaft gelehrter\r\nMänner, die auf Befehl Ihro Majestät des Königs von Dänemark nach\r\nArabien reisen,” (Questions addressed to a Society of Learned Men,\r\ntravelling at the Command of HM. the King of Denmark to Arabia),\r\nFrankfurt-on-the-Main 1762., p. 23., says in the 11th. question on\r\nLeprosy under head No. 8.: “Does it possess a natural diagnostic mark\r\nin this, if it breaks out everywhere at once, and covers the whole\r\nbody? From Leviticus XIII. 12-13. we might seem to be almost justified\r\nin concluding this to be so.

Πλάτων δὲ αὐτὸν ἐν Σκύθαις ὡς _λάλον_ σκώπτει·\r\nεἶχε δὲ Μελάνθιος λέπραν. (Melanthius the Tragedian; for he is derided\r\non account of his luxurious living and gluttony. But Plato laughs at\r\nhim in the “Scythians” as a _garrulous_ person; now Melanthius had\r\n_leprosy_). The same thing is mentioned in the “Peace”, 803., with\r\nthe addition, καὶ πολὺ μᾶλλον ἐν Κόλαξιν Εὔπολις ὡς κίναιδον αὐτὸν\r\nδιαβάλλει καὶ κόλακα· ἀλλὰ καὶ ὡς λευκὰς ἔχοντα καὶ λεπράς. (and\r\nstill more severely does Eupolis in his “Flatterers” ridicule him\r\nas being _pathic_ and a flatterer; moreover as having whites,—white\r\nleprosies,—and leprosies). Here we would particularly call attention\r\nto the λευκαί (white leprosies), which we have already noted as a\r\nconsequence of the habits of the _cunnilingue_; and with this the\r\nλάλον (garrulous, talkative) of the Comic poet Plato agrees very\r\nwell, for _Hesychius_ explains γλωσσοστροφεῖν (to ply the tongue) by\r\n_περιλαλεῖν_ and στωμύλλεσθαι (_to be very talkative, to babble_). Thus\r\n_lepra_ would seem to be attached as penalty to the vice of the pathic,\r\nElephantiasis is stated to be infectious by _Aretaeus_, Morb. chron.,\r\nII. 12. and _Paulus Aegineta_, IV. 1.; however, present day experience\r\ntells us nothing of this, and the later Greek physicians refer it again\r\nto deficient gall (Marx, Orig. contag., p. 78.); what was the meaning\r\nof its great contagiousness in earlier times?\r\n\r\n[189] _Von Roeser_, loco citato p. 69.

(And if the Summer is a dry\r\none, the diseases will cease more speedily; if on the other hand it is\r\nrainy, they become chronic, and such that cancerous sores are set up on\r\nany pretext, if an injury of any sort occur).\r\n\r\n[194] _Galen_, in his Commentary on this passage (Vol. XVII. A. p.\r\n671) says in this connection: διεσήπετο δ’ ὑπὸ τῶν μοχθηρῶν χυμῶν ὑγρῶν\r\nτὰ στερεά· ποικίλον δ’ εἶναι τὸ ῥεῦμα διὰ τὴν τῶν σηπομένων διαφθορὰν\r\nεὔλογον· ὑπὸ γὰρ κοινῆς αἰτίας τῆς σηπεδόνος ἕκαστον τῶν σηπομένων ἴδιον\r\nεἶδος ἴσχει τῆς διαφθορᾶς. (But under influence of the morbid moist\r\njuices the solid parts rotted away; so it is only reasonable to expect\r\nthe discharge to be complex, resulting from the destruction of the\r\nparts rotted away; for although proceeding from one common cause, that\r\nof decomposition, each of the rotting parts has its own particular form\r\nof decomposition).\r\n\r\n[195] _Galen_, in his Commentary loco citato p. 672., adds: φοβερωτέραν\r\nεἶχε φαντασίαν ἐν τοῖς περὶ κεφαλὴν μορίοις, διὰ τὸ κᾂν βραχὺ τὴν παρὰ\r\nφύσιν ἐνταῦθα παραλαχθείη, πλέον γίνεσθαι τὸ αἶσχος ἢ κατὰ τὰ ἄλλα\r\nμόρια μεγάλην ἐκτροπὴν εἰς τὸ παρὰ φύσιν ἔχοντα. μηροῦ μὲν γὰρ τὸ\r\nβραχίονος ἢ κνήμης ἢ πήχεως ἀποῤῥυὲν δέρμα μικροτέραν ἔχει φαντασίαν,\r\nεἰ δὲ τῆς κεφαλῆς συναποπέσοιεν αἱ τρίχες τῷ δέρματι καὶ πολὺ μᾶλλον\r\nἡ τοῦ γενείου σὺν αὐταῖς, ἡ μὲν φαντασία τοῦ πάθους γίνεται μεγάλη, ὁ\r\nκίνδυνος δ’ ᾗττον ἢ εἰ περὶ αἰδοῖα συμβαίη τὸ τοιοῦτον πάθος ἢ λάρυγγα\r\nκαὶ θώρακα καί τι τῶν κυρίων· οὐ μόνον δὲ τὰ περὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν οὕτως\r\nγινόμενα φοβερὰ μᾶλλον ἦν ἢ κακίω, ἀλλὰ καὶ καθ’ ὁτιοῦν ἄλλο μέρος\r\nοὕτως ἐκπίπτοντα· κακίω γὰρ ἦν ἐφ’ ὧν ἀπέστησεν εἰς τὸ βάθος ὁ τὸ\r\nἐρυσίπελας ἐργαζόμενος χυμὸς κ. τ. λ. (It offered a more terrifying\r\nappearance where the parts about the head were affected, because even\r\nif only a small deviation occur there from what is normal, the feeling\r\nof disgust experienced is greater than in connection with other parts\r\nof the body, even when showing a great divergence towards what is\r\nabnormal. For the fact of the skin of the thigh being perished, or even\r\nwhen showing of the upper arm, or of the leg, or fore-arm, affords a\r\nless formidable appearance, but if the hair fall from the head and the\r\nskin along with it, and still more if that of the cheeks and chin go\r\nwith it, the appearance of injury is very great; but the danger is all\r\nthe while really less than if the like were to happen to the private\r\nparts or larynx and thorax or any of the vital parts. And not only are\r\nsuch things when they happen to the head more terrifying than actually\r\ndangerous, but also when it so falls out with regard to any other part;\r\nfor much more dangerous is the case of those in whom the humour that\r\nsets up erysipelas has penetrated deeply in, etc.).\r\n\r\n[196] Hippocrates, loco citato p. 284., πολλοῖσι μὲν γὰρ βραχίων καὶ\r\nπῆχυς ὅλος [ὅλως] περιεῤῥύη· οἷσι δ’ ἐπὶ τὰ πλευρὰ ταῦτα ἐκακοῦτο ἢ\r\nτῶν ἔμπροσθέν τι ἢ τῶν ὄπισθεν· οἷσι δὲ ὅλος ὁ μηρὸς ἢ τὰ περικνήμια\r\nἐψιλοῦτο καὶ ποὺς ὅλος· ἢν δὲ πάντων χαλεπώτατον τῶν τοιούτων, ὅτε περὶ\r\nἥβην καὶ αἰδοῖα γενοίατο, καὶ τὰ μὲν περὶ ἕλκεα καὶ μετὰ προφάσιος\r\nτοιαῦτα· πολλοῖσι δὲ ἐν πυρετοῖσι καὶ πρὸ πυρετοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ πυρετοῖσι\r\nξυνέπιπτεν.

(And in the Summer\r\n... occur also _putrefactions of the privates_ and transpirations).\r\n\r\n[199] Very possibly in many cases these affections of the\r\nextremities and genital organs owed their existence to _anthrax_\r\nor _carbuncle_; for not only does _Hippocrates_ (p. 487.) say that\r\nἄνθρακες πολλοὶ κατὰ θέρος καὶ ἄλλα ἃ σὴψ καλέεται (many cases\r\nof malignant pustule in Summer-time, as well as other complaints\r\nknown under the general name of putrefaction) appeared under these\r\nmeteorological conditions, but _Galen_ likewise (Method. med. bk. XIV.,\r\nedit. Kühn Vol. X. p. 980.) observed an _anthrax_ epidemic in Asia,\r\nthat itself began with numerous _phlyctaenae_ (blisterous swellings)\r\nresembling millet seeds; these subsequently broke and gave rise to an\r\nἕλκος ἐσχαρῶδες (scabby sore). Indeed the destruction of the skin took\r\nplace even without the previous occurrence of _phlyctaenae_. πολλάκις\r\nδὲ οὐ μία _φλύκταινα_ γεννᾶται κνησαμένων, ἀλλὰ _πολλαὶ_ μικραὶ καθάπερ\r\nτινὲς κέγχροι καταπυκνοῦσαι τὸ μέρος ὧν ἐκρηγνυμένων ὁμοίως ἐσχαρῶδες\r\nἕλκος γεννᾶται· κατὰ _δὲ τοὺς ἐπιδημήσαντας ἄνθρακας ἐν Ἀσίᾳ καὶ\r\nχωρὶς φλυκταινῶν_ ἐνίοις εὐθέως ἀπεδάρη τὸ δέρμα. (And often _not one\r\nphlyctaena_ is originated on patients scratching themselves, but _many_\r\nminute ones like millet seeds, closely covering the affected part;\r\nand when these have broken, a kind of scabby sore is produced. And in\r\ncases of _anthrax_ (malignant pustule), which was at one time epidemic\r\nin Asia, in some patients even without there having been previous\r\n_phlyctaenae_, the skin was immediately destroyed).—Comp. _Galen_, De\r\ntumor. praeternat.

Further, this information is in\r\nany case of importance for the more correct appreciation of the facts\r\nas to the Plague of Athens.\r\n\r\n[200] _Thucydides_, Peloponnesian War, bk. II. ch. 49.,\r\nΔιεξῄει γὰρ διὰ παντὸς τοῦ σώματος ἄνωθεν ἀρξάμενον τὸ ἐν τῇ κεφαλῇ\r\nπρώτον ἱδρυθὲν κακόν· καὶ εἴ τις ἐκ τῶν μεγίστων περιγένοιτο, τῶν γε\r\nἀκρωτηρῖων ἀντίληψις _αὐτὸν_ ἐπεσήμαινε· κατέσκηπτε γὰρ ἐς αἰδοῖα καὶ\r\nἐς ἄκρας χεῖρας καὶ πόδας· καὶ πολλοὶ στερισκόμενοι τούτων διέφευγον·\r\n(for translation see text above). In this passage it is usual to\r\nread ἀντίληψις _αὐτοῦ_ ἐπεσήμαινε, supplying κακοῦ from the previous\r\nclause to go with αὐτοῦ—(the seizure of the disease itself on the\r\nextremities manifested itself); but even supposing the double genitive\r\nwith ἀντίληψις defensible, the construction is still very awkward,\r\nand is made still more so by the fact that in taking it this way we\r\nare compelled to translate ἐπεσήμαινε by “manifested itself” (mali\r\nvis, apprehendens extremas corporis partes se prodebat, manifestam\r\nfaciebat,—the strength of the disease declared itself, made itself\r\nmanifest, in seizing the extremities of the body,—is Wittenbach’s\r\ninterpretation, Select. Hist. p. 367.), without by so doing obtaining\r\nany clear meaning of the sentence. On the other hand this is got\r\ndirectly we read with _Reiske_ (Annotations p. 21. in his “Thucydides\r\nReden, übersetzt von Reiske, nebst lateinischen Anmerkungen über\r\ndessen gesammtes Werk,”—Speeches in Thucydides translated into German\r\nby Reiske, together with Latin Notes on his “Histories” generally,\r\nLeipzig 1761. 8vo.) ἀντίληψις _αὐτὸν_ ἐπεσήμαινε,—a seizure put its\r\nmark on him. But whether αὐτοῦ is read or αὐτὸν in any case it will\r\nbe impossible to take the sentence as _Kraus_, p. 54., has done, when\r\nhe says: “The pustulous suppurative eruption begins with the head and\r\nspreads little by little over the entire body even to the hands and\r\nfeet. The fact that Thucydides had the eruption especially in his\r\nmind when he speaks of the gradual spread of the evil throughout the\r\nwhole body is shown by the expressions chosen by him “The disease goes\r\nthrough the entire body and _marks_ (ἐπεσήμαινε) hands and feet.” Now\r\nby what other of the symptoms mentioned would the affection of the\r\nhands and feet have been likely to make itself evident except by the\r\neruption?” There must surely be few readers of Thucydides capable of\r\nputting so radically false an interpretation on the Historian’s words.\r\n\r\n[201] _Lucretius_, De rerum natura bk.

Now if one or the other got typhus, or if such a patient\r\nwas already lying there, or was brought there, _the Venereal cases\r\nwithout exception took the typhus_, and particularly so during the\r\nmercurial treatment.”\r\n\r\n[207] _Schönlein_, “Vorlesungen”, (Prelections), Vol. II. p. 48., “The\r\nsyphilitic exanthema either remains stationary when typhus arises, or\r\ndisappears instantly and for ever—or the part affected with syphilis\r\nbecomes gangrenous.” _Neumann_, “Specielle Pathologie und Therapie”,\r\n(Special Pathology and Therapeutics), Vol. II. p. 107., “Violent,\r\nsevere typhoïdal fevers cure syphilis completely; its symptoms\r\ndisappear with the commencement of the illness and never return.—Again\r\nafter Petechial fever I have in most cases observed that the syphilis\r\ntroubles that disappeared at its commencement never came back again.”\r\n_Historical_ vouchers will be afforded in plenty by our later\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n[208] Works, Vol. I. p. 765.

This fact points to various conclusions as\r\nto liability to infection in Leprosy and the obscurity in which the\r\ncauses of the disease are involved.\r\n\r\n[211] In accordance with the explanations given on a previous page\r\nit might be thought quite conceivable that so long as the hymen\r\nwas intact, a part of the mucous discharge of the vagina and of\r\nthe menstrual blood was retained, and acquired a certain degree of\r\nmalignity. This acting on points of the penis where the surface had\r\nbeen accidentally broken in the act of defloration, or even on the\r\nmucous membrane of the urethra, might exert an injurious influence.\r\n\r\n[212] _Euripides_, Iphigeneia in Tauris 380. _Porphyrius_, bk.

(Now all the\r\nBarbarians that dwell towards the West, use pitch as a depilatory,\r\nand shave their bodies. Indeed amongst the Tyrrhenians establishments\r\nare fitted up in numbers for this purpose, and there are artistes who\r\npractise this profession, like barbers among ourselves. And when men\r\ngo into their shops, they expose themselves in every part, feeling no\r\nshame of spectators nor of passers-by. And this custom is followed\r\nalso by many of the Greeks and of the inhabitants of Italy, who have\r\nlearned it from Samnites and Messapians). The depilation of men and\r\nboys was attended to by women (_Martial_, XI. 79.) at the period of the\r\nhighest degree of dissoluteness; in fact there was a special guild of\r\nsuch women, known as _ustriculae_. _Tertullian_, De pallio ch. 4. In\r\nthe same way men performed this service for women, as e. g. _Domitian_,\r\naccording to _Suetonius_, ch. 22., Erat fama, quasi concubinas ipse\r\ndevelleret (Rumour went, to the effect that the Emperor used to “pluck”\r\nhis mistresses with his own hand,)—and _Heliogabalus_ according to\r\n_Lampridius_, ch. 31., In balneis semper cum mulieribus fuit, ita ut\r\neas ipse psilothro curaret, ipse quoque barbam psilothro accurans,\r\nquodque pudendum dictu est, eodem quo mulieres accurabantur, et eadem\r\nhora. Rasit et virilia subactoribus suis ad novaculam manu sua, qua\r\npostea barbam fecit. (At the baths he was always with the women,\r\ngoing so far as to apply the “psilothrum” (a depilatory) in their\r\ntreatment himself, finishing off his own beard also with “psilothrum”,\r\nand using, disgusting to relate, the same as the women were being\r\ntreated with, and at one and the same time. Moreover he shaved his\r\ndebauchees’ (pathics) privates to the navel with his own hand, and then\r\nshaved his own beard).\r\n\r\n[214] They used to remove the hair on the _face_ (_Martial_, III. 74.),\r\nfrom the _nose_ (Ovid, Art. Amand. I. 520.), on the arches of the\r\n_eyebrows_ (Cicero, Orat. pro Roscio), from the armpits (_Juvenal_,\r\nXIV. 194., _Seneca_, Epist. 115.), on the _arms_ (_Martial_, III. 63.),\r\nthe _hands_ (_Martial_, V. 41.), on the _legs_ (_Juvenal_, IX. 12.) As\r\nto the beard, that has already been spoken of.\r\n\r\n[215] _Martial_, II. 62., Cui praestas culum, quem, Labiene, pilas. (To\r\nwhom you give your fundament, Labienus, that you strip of hair).\r\n\r\n[216] _Martial_, II. 62.,\r\n\r\n    Quod pectus, quod crura tibi, quod brachia vellis,\r\n    Quod cincta est brevibus _mentula tonsa_ pilis,\r\n    Haec praestas, Labiene, tuae, quis nescit? amicae.\r\n\r\n(You pluck your chest, your legs, your arms, your _shaven member_ is\r\nsurrounded by short hair,—all these pains you offer, everyone knows it,\r\nto your mistress.) Bk.

For the same reason Mnesilochus was freed of hair on the genitals\r\nand in all other parts of the body, so as not to be recognised in the\r\nassemblage of women.\r\n\r\n[218] Aristophanes, Eccl. 718., says of prostitutes:\r\n\r\n    καὶ τάς γε δούλας οὐχὶ δεῖ κοσμουμένας\r\n    τὴν τῶν ἐλευθέρων ὑφαρπάζειν Κύπριν,\r\n    ἀλλὰ παρὰ τοῖς δούλοισι κοιμᾶσθαι μόνον.\r\n    κατωνάκῃ _τὸν χοῖρον ἀποτετιλμένας_.\r\n\r\n(And the slave-women ought not to bedizen themselves and snatch\r\naway the love that is free-women’s by rights; but should lie with\r\nslaves only, their pudenda plucked clean to please the wearer of the\r\nsmock.)

Such _nice allurements_ are for girls. You are mistaken\r\nif you think yours is of a sort that a man’s member should be fain\r\nto belong to it.) This passage, together with those quoted a little\r\nabove from Aristophanes and Theopompus, will explain sufficiently what\r\n_Horace_ (Sat. I. 2. v. 36.) meant by his “mirator _cunni_ Cupiennius\r\n_albi_,” (Cupiennius admirer of a _white organ_), for the _albus_\r\n(white) here evidently stands for _rasus_, _depilatus_, _nudus_,\r\n(shaven, freed from hair, bare); as in _Juvenal_, Sat. I. 111., Nuper\r\nin hanc urbem _pedibus_ qui venerat _albis_, (Who but now had arrived\r\nin this city with white, i. e. bare, feet.) The commentators have\r\nhitherto always explained it by _matrona stola alba_, seu _candida_,\r\n_vestita_, (a matron clad in a white, or glistening-white, robe),\r\nbecause, as _Heindorf_ puts it, no other interpretation is to hand.\r\nBut really there are several possible explanations on similar lines.\r\nIt might be for “_canus_ cunnus”, (hoary, aged; organ) (_Martial_, bk.\r\nIX. 38., bk. II. 34.), though again the meaning of _depilatus_ (free\r\nof hair), in another sense, might equally well be at the bottom of\r\nthis, as is the case with _cana labra_ (hoary, white, lips)—IX. 28. Or\r\n_albus_ (white) may be taken as synonymous with _increta_, _cerussata_\r\n(whitened with chalk, painted with ceruse), to which _Martial_ supplies\r\nthe explanation, when he says (III. 42.),\r\n\r\n    Lomento rugas uteri quod condere tentas,\r\n    Polla, tibi ventrem, non mihi labra linis;\r\n\r\n(When you endeavour to hide the wrinkles on your stomach with powder,\r\n’tis your own belly, Polla, not my lips, you smear with the stuff),—as\r\nalso bk. IX. 3., Illa _siligineis_ pinguescit adultera _cunnis_,\r\n(It—i. e. your penis—in adulterous loves, grows fat on women’s organs\r\npowdered with fine wheaten flour); [but another way of taking the line\r\nis: She, i. e. your mistress,—adulterous dame, grows fat on wheaten\r\ncakes—cakes baked in the shape of _cunni_.] The _Lomentum_, which is\r\nnot derived from _lavimentum_ or _lavamentum_ (something to wash with),\r\nas Scheller, following Voss, makes it to be, but from the Greek λείωμα\r\nfaba communita (_ground_ beans), was bean-meal (_Vegetius_, De re\r\nveterin. V. 62., says: in subtilissimo lomento, hoc est farina fabacea,\r\n(in the finest _lomentum_, that is bean-flour.); and at the present\r\nday the Japanese, it seems, according to _Thunberg_, use a kind of\r\nbean-meal instead of soap. Roman ladies were most careful to maintain\r\nthe _aequor ventris_ (smoothness of the belly)—_Aulus Gellius_, Noctes\r\nAtt. I. 2.); whence _Martial_, (III. 72.) says, addressing Laufella,\r\nwho refuses to bathe with him:\r\n\r\n    Aut tibi pannosae pendent a pectore mammae\r\n    Aut _sulcos uteri_ prodere nuda times.\r\n\r\n(Either your breasts hang flabby from your bosom, or you fear, if you\r\nstrip, to betray the furrows on your belly.) To obviate wrinkles on\r\nthe face, they sprinkled their faces with chalk; and so _Petronius_,\r\n(Satyr. ch. 23.) says: et inter rugas malarum tantum erat cretae, ut\r\nputares detectum parietem nimbo laborare, (and amidst the wrinkles of\r\nthe cheeks was so much chalk, that you would think a partition-wall\r\nhad been stripped and was wrapped in a cloud of dust); and we read\r\nin _Lucian’s_ poem (Greek Anthology, Bk. II. tit. 9.) μὴ τοίνυν τὸ\r\nπρόσωπον ἅπαν ψιμύθῳ κατάπλαττε. (Now don’t besmear all your face with\r\nceruse). However if _cunnus must_ be taken as equivalent to _femina_\r\n(a woman), it would be on all fours with _albus amicus_ (white,\r\nwhite-faced, friend) in _Martial_ (bk. X. 12.), which _Farnabius_\r\nexplains by σκιατρόφος (reared in the shade, delicate), answering\r\nmore or less to our “_Whey-face_”. At any rate _any_ of these\r\ninterpretations are for certain nearer the truth than the _stola alba_\r\n(clad in _a white robe_) one.\r\n\r\n[221] Italae nonnullae se depiles tangere amant circa partes hymenaeo\r\nsacras, _veritae foetationem morpionum_ (Some Italian women like\r\nto feel the skin bare of hair round those parts that are sacred to\r\nmarriage, _fearing the foul breeding of lice_), writes _Rolfink_,\r\n“Ordo et methodus generationi dicat. partium cognoscendi fabricam,”\r\n(Orderly and Systematic Knowledge of the Structure of the Parts\r\ndevoted to Procreation). Jena 1664. 4to., p. 185. This may have been\r\none motive among the Ancients also for the removal of the hair, for\r\nAristotle in his time (Hist. Anim. bk. V. ch. 25.) is acquainted with\r\nfelt-lice (crabs), and calls them φθεῖρες ἄγριοι (wild lice), without\r\nhowever mentioning what part of the person they infest. His words are:\r\nἔστι δὲ γένος φθειρῶν, _οἳ καλοῦνται ἄγριοι_, καὶ σκληρότεροι τῶν\r\nἐν τοῖς πολλοῖς γιγνομένων· εἰσὶ δὲ οὗτοι καὶ δυσαφαίρετοι ἀπὸ τοῦ\r\nσώματος. (There is another kind of lice, _called wild lice_, and more\r\ntroublesome than the common sort. It is most difficult to rid the body\r\nof these). _Celsus_, De re medica bk. VI. chs. 6. and 15., mentions\r\nthem as occurring in the eye-lashes: Genus quoque vitii est, qui inter\r\npilos palpebrarum pediculi nascuntur. φθειρίασιν Graeci nominant.\r\n(There is another kind of taint, lice that breed among the hair of the\r\neyelids; it is called in Greek φθειρίασις—lousiness.)\r\n\r\n[222] _Lockervitzens, Christ._ Disp.

Sic praeceptum _circumcisionis_, antiquissima plane\r\nconsuetudo, idcirco fortassis instituta fuerat, atque tanquam ritus\r\nsacer, tanquam praeceptum quoddam, de quo dispensari nemo queat,\r\nintroducebatur, quod circumcisus videatur difficilius morbum urethrae\r\ncontrahere, rariusque ablato scilicet praeputio, intra quod virus\r\nhaeret, rodit, cancros facit, quod et ipsum efficitur pessime in\r\nphymosi, paraphymosi. Glans ipsa in homine minus facile virus resorbere\r\nvidetur, occallescens nempe.... Nota viriginitatis sedulo examinata est\r\nin neonuptis puellis; custodia foeminarum per totum orientem; adulterii\r\ncrimen, maxime foeminarum, morte expiatum _videntur docere, scivisse\r\nantiquitatem remotissimam, morbum quendam gravem, immundum volgivaga\r\nVenere dari et communicari_. (With _Hensler_ I pronounce it—Venereal\r\ndisease—to be of most ancient origin, and to have been of such\r\nfrequency among the Egyptians, Jews, as well as the Greeks and Romans,\r\nthat it may well _be possible to discover in it the cause of sundry\r\nhabits, customs, laws and enactments of these Peoples_.... For instance\r\nthe precept of circumcision, evidently an extremely ancient custom, was\r\nvery possibly first instituted for this reason, and was introduced in\r\nthe guise of a sacred rite, a ceremonial precept from which there can\r\nbe no dispensation, because the circumcised man would seem less readily\r\nto contract disease of the urethra, and in cases where the prepuce has\r\nbeen removed, inside which the poison remains adherent and corrodes,\r\nless frequently suffers from chancres, an effect that follows in its\r\nworst form in phymosis and paraphymosis. The _glans penis_ itself in\r\na man thus treated seems to absorb the poison less easily, being in\r\nfact grown partially callous.... The fact that the sign of virginity\r\nwas scrupulously examined in newly married virgins, the careful guard\r\nkept over women throughout the East, the penalty of death attached to\r\nthe crime of adultery, especially in women, _all seem to show that the\r\nremotest Antiquity was aware of some serious, foul disease being given\r\nand communicated by indiscriminate Love_.\r\n\r\n[234] _Strabo_, Geograph.

Hence we commonly find\r\namong the Ancients the custom, merely after the evacuation of urine\r\nand fæces, of cleansing the parts concerned. Accordingly _Josephus_,\r\nDe Bello Judaic. Bk. II. ch. 8., says: καίπερ δὲ φυσικῆς οὔσης τῆς\r\nτῶν σωματικῶν λυμάτων ἐκκρίσεως ἀπολούεσθαι μετ’ αὐτὴν, καθάπερ\r\nμεμιασμένοις, ἔθιζον. (And even though the evacuation of the bodily\r\ndefilements was in the course of nature, they were accustomed to wash\r\nthemselves after it, as in the case of men polluted). The Romans used\r\nfor the purpose a sponge fastened to the end of a stick, as we see from\r\n_Seneca_, Letter 70, where he says: Lignum, quod ad emendanda obscoena\r\nadhaerente spongia positum est, totum in gulam sparsit, (The stick\r\nthat is placed with a sponge fixed to it for cleansing filth, this he\r\nshook right in his mouth). Slaves took stones, bulbs, etc. for the\r\npurpose. _Aristophanes_, Plut. IV. 1. After making water it was usual\r\nto wash the hands. _Petronius_, Satyr. 27. Exonerata ille vesica, aquam\r\npoposcit ad manus. (After relieving his bladder, he asked for water for\r\nhis hands). This care for cleanliness roused, as mentioned before, the\r\nutmost anger on the part of Saint Athanasius; but it is to this day the\r\ncustom among the Turks, for it is enjoined by the Koran (Sure IV. 42.),\r\neven adding that only one hand ought to be used (_Niebuhr_, Description\r\nof Arabia, p. 78.), namely the _left_. The same hand was used also by\r\nthe Romans, as well as perhaps by all ancient Peoples. Hence _Martial_\r\nsays, bk. XI. 59., sed lota mentula laeva.... (but my member, when\r\nmy left hand has been washed....). With the left hand, amica manus\r\n(the _mistress_ hand), masturbation was performed, _Martial_, IX. 42.\r\nXI. 74.; it served to cover the genitals, _Lucian_, Amor. 13., hence\r\naccording to _Ovid_, Ars amandi, Bk. II. 613.\r\n\r\n    Ipsa Venus pubem quoties velamina ponit,\r\n    Protegitur laeva semireducta manu\r\n\r\n(Venus herself, as oft as she lays aside her garments, half withdrawn\r\ncovers herself with her left hand), and Priapus is represented in Art\r\nholding the penis with the left hand, Priapeia 24. 34. If we are not\r\nmistaken, this was also the case with Horus among the Egyptians. What\r\nhas just been said explains at the same time the reason why the left\r\nhand has from of old been held in disrepute, an idea still preserved in\r\nthe expression, to marry, to be married, _with the left hand_.\r\n\r\n[242] _Friedr. Hoffmann_, Diss. med. 3., asserit luem Veneream\r\nConstantinopolidos non grassari, quod feminae munditiei apprime\r\nstudiosae post opus aquam sumant et locos diligenter colluant (asserts\r\nthat Venereal disease is not prevalent at Constantinople, because\r\nthe women being extremely careful of cleanliness take water after\r\ntheir work and scrupulously wash the parts), says _Astruc_, I. p.\r\n108. This is further confirmed by _Oppenheim_, “Ueber den Zustand der\r\nHeilkunde etc. in der Türkei,” (On the Condition of Medical Science\r\netc. in Turkey), Hamburg 1838., p. 81., who writes: “Without the great\r\ncleanliness of the Turks, who after any single occasion of coition not\r\nonly practise washing, but wherever at all possible, go to the bath as\r\nwell, the disease (Venereal) would undoubtedly be still more widely\r\nspread.”\r\n\r\n[243] Herodotus, Histor.

The\r\nsame Writer, De mercede meretricis non accepienda in sacrar., (Of\r\nHarlots’ Hire not meet to be Taken in the Holy Place), Works edit.\r\nMangey Vol. II. p. 265., moreover states that in his time the public\r\nwomen made frequent use of warm baths.\r\n\r\n[248] _Europa_ bathed in Crete after coition with Zeus (Antigonus\r\nCarystius, Hist. mirab. 179.), Venus after the first embraces of Vulcan\r\n(Athenaeus, Deipnos.

(passing\r\ntheir nights in this way, enjoying indiscrimate sleep and a couch\r\nteeming with wantonness; from the which each man when he has risen,\r\nstraightway is in need of bathing). _Hesiod_, Works and Days 731.,\r\nwrites,\r\n\r\n    μηδ’ αἰδοῖα γονῇ πεπαλαγμένος ἔνδοθι οἴκου\r\n    ἑστίη ἐμπελαδὸν παραφαινέμεν, ἀλλ’ ἀλέασθαι.\r\n\r\n(Nor yet when done with generation, within the house hard by the hearth\r\nexpose the privates, but retire aside).\r\n\r\n[250] _Persius_, Sat. II. 15.,\r\n\r\n    Haec sancte ut poscas, Tiberino in gurgite mergis\r\n    Mane caput bis terque et _noctem flumine purgas_.\r\n\r\n(That you may make this request free from taint, you plunge your head\r\nin Tiber’s flood twice and three times at dawn, and _purge away your\r\nnight in the stream_). _Gregory the Great_, Answers to ten Questions\r\nof Augustine, first English Bishop: Vir cum propria uxore dormiens,\r\nintrare ecclesiam, non debet, sed neque lotus intrare statim debet....\r\nEt quamvis de hac re diversae hominum nationes diversa sentiant, atque\r\ncustodire videantur, _Romanorum tamen semper atque ab antiquioribus_\r\nusus fuit, post ad mixtionem propriae coniugis et lavacrii\r\npurificationem ab ingressu ecclesiae paullatim reverenter abstinere. (A\r\nman sleeping with his own wife, ought not to enter a church, and not\r\neven when washed ought he to enter immediately after.... And although\r\non this matter different nations of mankind hold different opinions\r\nand appear to keep different customs, yet the Romans’ practice always\r\nand from the most ancient times has ever been, that subsequently to\r\nintercourse with his lawful wife and the purification of the bath a man\r\nreverently abstain for a while from entering a church). For the same\r\nreason _Tibullus_ says, Carmina bk. II. 1.,\r\n\r\n    Vos quoque abesse procul jubeo discedite ab aris,\r\n    Queis tulit hesterna gaudia nocte, Venus.\r\n\r\n(You too I bid stand afar off, depart ye from the altars, to whom\r\nyesternight Venus brought her joys).

(And so she came forward outside her chamber, and\r\nif she _were going for water_).—_Cicero_, Orat. pro Caelio, ch. 14.\r\nrepresents his grandfather Appius Claudius Caecus, who (442 A. U. C.)\r\nhad constructed the Appian Way, say to his depraved granddaughter:\r\nIdeo aquam adduxi ut ea tu inceste uterere? (Was it for this I brought\r\nthe water to Rome, that you might use it for abominable purposes?)\r\nComp. Casaubon on Cicero, Letters to Atticus, bk. I. Letter 16. For\r\nthe same reason women and girls who only rarely participated in sexual\r\nintercourse were called _siccae_ (dry) (_Plautus_, Miles Glor. III.\r\n1. 192. _Martial_, XI. Epigr. 82. _Petronius_, Sat. 37.), in contrast\r\nto the _uda puella_ (wet girl) _Juvenal_, Sat. X. 321. _Martial_, XI.\r\n17., who was obliged to wash herself frequently. So too _illota_ or\r\n_illauta_ virgo (unwashed maid) stands for _intacta_ virgo (untouched\r\nmaid), as in _Plautus_, Poenul. I. sc. 2. 22. Nam quae lavata est,\r\nnisi perculta est, meo quidem animo, quasi _illauta_ est. (For she who\r\nis washed, unless she is bedecked as well, in my opinion, is as good\r\nas _unwashed_). In fact the whole of this scene is important for our\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[252] _Festus_, p. 19. under word _Aquarioli_: Aquarioli\r\ndicebantur mulierum impudicarum sordidi asseclae. (Aquarioli, or\r\nwater-boys, a name given to the shameless attendants of immodest\r\nwomen).—_Tertullian_, Apologet. ch. 43. They were also known as\r\n_baccariones_ from baccarium, a word which _Isidor_ explains by\r\naquarium (a water vessel). An old Gloss says: baccario πορνοδιάκονος,\r\nmeritricibus aquam infundens (baccario, a prostitutes’ attendant, one\r\nwho pours water for whores); another: aquarioli, βαλλάδες, βαλλὰς, from\r\nβάλλων ὕδωρ, ab aqua jaciunda (water-boys, or throwers, from throwing\r\nwater). These aquarioli at the same time carried on the business of\r\nprocurers; so _Juvenal_ says, Sat. VI. 331., veniet conductus aquarius.\r\n(Some water-carrier will come, hired for the purpose). Comp. _Lipsius_,\r\nAntiq. lect. I. 12. Hence also the word _aquaculare_ was used meaning\r\nlenocinari (to be a pandar); see _Turnebus_, Adversar. XIV. 12. XXVIII.\r\n5. Besides this they held themselves, especially in the public baths,\r\nat the disposal of lustful women, very often earning in this way the\r\nBath farthing they had to pay. Probably Dasius in _Martial_, bk. II.\r\nEpigr. 52., was such an Aquariolus.\r\n\r\n    Novit loturas Dasius numerare, poposcit\r\n    Mammosam Spatalen pro tribus, illa dedit.\r\n\r\n(Dasius knew well how to count the women going to bathe; he asked\r\nbig-bosomed Spatalé the price for three, and she gave it). Hence the\r\n_quadrantaria permutatio_ (farthing barter) in Cicero, Orat pro Caelio\r\nch. 26. Comp. _Juvenal_, Sat. VI. 428.,\r\n\r\n    Callidus et cristae digitos impressit aliptes,\r\n    Ac summum dominae femur exclamare coegit.\r\n\r\n(The artful masseur too pressed his fingers on the clytoris, and\r\nmade the upper part of his mistress’ thigh resound under his hands).\r\nFrom the passage of _Martial_ it follows that _Busch_, “Handbuch der\r\nErfindungen,” (Manual of Inventions), vol. II. p. 8., is mistaken in\r\nsaying: _Women_ and persons not yet adult had the bath _gratis_; in\r\nfact in the passage from Juvenal, Sat. II. 152., quoted by him, it\r\nis a question of boys only. For the rest, the Aquarioli recall the\r\nλουτροφόροι (water-bearers) of the Greeks; these were boys, whose\r\nduty it was to fetch the water for the Bride’s bath before marriage.\r\n_Pollux_, Onomast.

But if it has been indulged in\r\nby man or woman, they ought to be cleansed in the river or in flowing\r\nwater, before they touch the victuals).

II. 371).\r\n\r\n    Μὴδὲ γυναικείῳ λυτρῷ χρόα φαιδρύνεσθαι,\r\n\r\nπαραινεῖ· κοινὰ δὲ ἀνέωκται ἀνδράσιν ὁμοῦ καὶ γυναιξὶ τὰ βαλανεῖα·\r\nκἀντεῦθεν ἐπὶ ἀκρασίαν ἀποδύονται· ἐκ τοῦ γὰρ εἰσορᾶν, γίνεται\r\nἀνθρώποις ἐρᾶν· ὥσπερ ἀποκλυζομένης τῆς αἰδοῦς αὐτοῖς κατὰ τὰ λουτρὰ·\r\nαἱ δὲ μὴ εἰς τοσοῦτον ἀπερυθριῶσαι, τοὺς μὲν ὀθνείους ἀποκλείουσιν,\r\nἰδίοις δὲ οἰκέταις συλλούονται, καὶ δούλοις ἀποδύονται γυμναὶ, καὶ\r\nἀνατρίβονται ὑπ’ αὐτῶν, ἐξουσίαν δοῦσαι τῷ κατεπτηχότι τῆς ἐπιθυμίας,\r\nτὸ ἀδεὲς τῆς ψηλαφήσεως· οἱ γὰρ παρεισαγόμενοι παρὰ τὰ λουτρὰ ταῖς\r\nδεσποίναις γυμναῖς, μελέτην ἴσχουσιν ἀποδύσασθαι πρὸς τόλμαν ἐπιθυμίας\r\nἔθει πονηρῷ παραγράφοντες τὸν φόβον. (And of a truth they would not\r\nstrip before their own husbands, feigning a pretended plausibility of\r\nmock-modesty; but for other men, whosoever will, may readily see the\r\nwomen that are so close shut up at home, naked at the Baths. For there\r\nthey are nowise ashamed to strip before the spectators, looking on\r\nlike dealers in human flesh; whereas Hesiod (Works and Days, bk. II.\r\n371.) advises “But do not, for the earning of a woman’s price, let her\r\nwash her skin bright and clean.” Now the Baths are open for men and\r\nwomen alike. And hence their stripping leads to incontinence; for from\r\nseeing, men come to desire, as though their modesty were washed away\r\nin the Baths. Other women that have not attained such effrontery, shut\r\nout strangers indeed, but wash along with their own house-slaves, and\r\nare stripped naked before their servants and are rubbed by them, giving\r\nopportunity to the man a-tremble with longing, the free right to handle\r\nwithout fear; for the men that are admitted into the Baths with their\r\nnaked mistresses take care to strip in such a way as to correspond to\r\nthe daring audacity of their longing, putting down fear to the count of\r\nevil habit).—_Cyprian_, De Virginum habitu: Quid vero, quae promiscuas\r\nbalneas adeunt, quae oculis ad libidinem curiosis, pudori ac pudicitae\r\ndicata corpora prostituunt, quae cum viros ac a viris nudae vident\r\nturpiter ac videntur, nonne ipsae illecebram vitiis praestant. (But in\r\ntruth, those women that frequent indiscrimate Baths, that expose to\r\nprying and lustful eyes their bodies that should be dedicate to modest\r\nshamefacedness, that along with men see what is disgraceful to see and\r\nin nakedness are seen by men, do not such women offer an enticement to\r\nsinfulness?) Comp. _Mercurialis_, De arte Gymnast. bk. I. ch. 10.—It\r\nis true we read in _Julius Caesar_, De bello Gallico bk. VI. ch. 21.,\r\nof the ancient Germans: Intra annum vero vicessimum feminae notitiam\r\nhabuisse, in turpissimis habent rebus; cuius rei nulla est occultatio,\r\nquod et _promiscue in fluminibus perluuntur_, (But to have known a\r\nwoman under the twentieth year is held by them most disgraceful; and\r\nthere is no concealment of it, as _they bathe indiscriminately in the\r\nrivers_); but here the antecedent clause bars any suspicion of sexual\r\nexcesses having been invited by the practice.\r\n\r\n[267] _Seneca_, Epist. 86. says, speaking of the bath of Scipio:\r\nBalneolum angustum, tenebricosum ex consuetudine antiqua; non videbatur\r\nmaioribus nostris caldum nisi obscurum. (A little narrow bath-chamber,\r\ndim and gloomy after the antique fashion; our fathers could not believe\r\na bath warm unless it was dark too).—Next he describes explicitly the\r\nluxury of the Roman Baths, and then goes on,—In hoc balneo Scipionis\r\nminimae sunt rimae magis quam fenestrae, muro lapideo exsectae, ut\r\nsine iniuria munimenti lumen admitterent. At nunc _blattaria_ vocant\r\n_balnea_, si qua non ita aptata sunt, ut totius diei solem fenestris\r\namplissimis recipiant; nisi et lavantur et colorantur; nisi ex solio\r\nagros et maria prospiciant.... Imo si scias, non quotidie lavabatur.\r\nNam ut aiunt, qui priscos mores urbis tradiderunt, brachia et crura\r\nquotidie abluebant, quae scilicit sordes opere collegerant: ceterum\r\ntoti nundinis lavabantur. Hoc loco dicet aliquis, liquet mihi\r\nimmundissimos fuisse. Quid putas illos oluisse? militiam, laborem,\r\nvirum. Postquam munda balnea inventa sunt, spurciores sunt. (In this\r\nbath of Scipio there are tiny chinks rather than windows, cut through\r\nthe stone wall, so as to admit light without detriment to the shelter\r\nafforded. But nowadays men call them _Baths for night-moths_, any\r\nthat are not disposed in such a way as to let the sunlight enter all\r\nday long by immense windows; if they are not washed and sun-burned at\r\nonce; if they cannot look out on fields and sea from the pavement....\r\nIf you must know the truth, he did not bathe every day. For we are\r\ntold by those who have handed down accounts of the primitive manners\r\nof the City, our ancestors would wash daily arms and legs, for these\r\nhad grown soiled with the dust of toil: but they washed all over only\r\non market-days. Hearing this, it will be said, “It appears to me they\r\nmust have very filthy people.” Well! what think you it was they smelt\r\nof? Of fighting, and honest work, and manly vigour. Sweet, clean Baths\r\nhave been introduced; but the population is only more foul). Comp.\r\n_Plutarch_, Quaest. convival. VIII. 9. _Sidonius Apollinaris_ bk. II.\r\nEpist. 11. _Pliny_, Hist. nat.

Yet the Turk will never admit, or rather\r\nhe simply cannot bring himself to conceive, that he has contracted\r\nan infection through unclean cohabitation, but will be found always\r\nto give some other cause as occasioning his sickness. In fact the\r\nlanguage itself shows this; the Turkish expression for gonorrhœa is\r\n“_Belzouk_”, literally: chill of the back (from _bel_, back and _zouk_,\r\ncold), and chill or overheating will always be represented as having\r\nbrought it on.”—Moreover _Zeller von Zellenberg_, Abh. über die ersten\r\nErscheinungen venerischer Lokal-Krankheitsformen und deren Behandlung,\r\n(Dissertation on the earliest Appearances of Forms of Local Venereal\r\nDisease, and their Treatment), Vienna 1810., p. 7., is of the opinion,\r\nthat the reason of the imperfect knowledge possessed by the Ancients of\r\ngonorrhœa, chancre and buboes is to be found in this delayed appearance\r\nof the symptoms of disease after coition.\r\n\r\n[272] We see this in the clearest possible way from the passage of\r\n_Herodotus_, bk. I. ch. 9, 10., where Candaules wishes to induce Gyges\r\nto see his wife naked, in order to convince him of her beauty, but the\r\nlatter objects: ἅμα δὲ κιθῶνι ἐκδυομένῳ συνεκδύεται καὶ τὴν αἰδῶ γυνή·\r\nπάλαι δὲ τὰ καλὰ ἀνθρώποισι ἐξεύρηται, ἐκ τῶν μανθάνειν δεῖ·\r\n(but when she strips off her tunic, a woman strips off therewith\r\nher modesty likewise; now mankind have long ago ascertained what is\r\nhonourable, and from this we must learn how to act). Then Herodotus\r\nadds to this further (ch. 10.), παρὰ γὰρ τοῖσι Λυδοῖσι, σχεδὸν δὲ\r\nπαρὰ τοῖσι ἄλλοισι βαρβάροισι, καὶ ἄνδρα ὀφθῆναι γυμνὸν, ἐς αἰσχύνην\r\nμεγάλην φέρει· (for among the Lydians, as indeed among pretty nearly\r\nall Barbarians, for a person to be seen naked is counted for the\r\ngreatest disgrace).

(It is\r\nno long time since it appeared to the Greeks, as it does still to most\r\nof the Barbarian peoples, shameful and ridiculous for men to be seen\r\nnaked). In reference to the genital organs _Hesiod_ says (Works and\r\nDays 733.):\r\n\r\n    μηδ’ αἰδοῖα γονῇ πεπαλαγμένος ἔνδοθι οἴκου\r\n    ἑστίῃ ἐμπελαδὸν παραφαινέμεν, ἀλλ’ ἀλέασθαι·\r\n\r\n(Nor yet when done with generation, within the house hard by the hearth\r\nexpose the privates, but retire aside). St. Augustine, De civit. dei\r\nbk. XIV., Omnes gentes adeo tenent in usu pudenda velare, ut quidam\r\nbarbari illas corporis partes nec in balneis undas habeant. (All\r\nnations in fact make it a habit to cover the privates, so much so that\r\nsome Barbarians do not expose the parts of the body naked even in the\r\nBaths). _St. Ambrose_, Offic. I. 18., Licet plerique se et in lavacro,\r\nquantum possunt, tegant, ut vel illic, ubi nudum totum est corpus,\r\nhuius modi intecta portio sit. (Most men may also cover themselves,\r\nas much as they can, even in the Bath, so that even there, where the\r\nwhole body is naked, a part may so be hidden). _Arnobius_, bk. V.,\r\nPropudiosa corporum monstratur obscoenitas, obiectanturque partes\r\nillae, quas pudor communis abscondere, quas naturalis verecundiae lex\r\niubet, quas inter aures castas sine venia nefas est ac sine honoribus\r\napellare praefatis. (The foulest abomination of men’s bodies is\r\nexhibited, and those parts exposed, which common modesty, the natural\r\nlaw of shamefacedness, bids us conceal, which among ears polite it\r\nis forbidden to name without asking pardon and making a preface of\r\napologies).—bk. III., Insignire his partibus, quas enumerare, quas\r\npersequi probus audeat nemo, nec sine summae foeditatis horrore mentis\r\nimaginatione concipere. (To parade those parts, which no honourable man\r\ndare name or describe, nor even without a shudder at such a height of\r\nfoulness conceive a mental picture of). Comp. p. 42. and _Oppenheim_,\r\nloco citato p. 128., who undoubtedly ranks the importance of the vice\r\nof paederastia too high, when he finds in it the main reason for the\r\nfeeling of shame prevalent among the Turks.\r\n\r\n[273] _Aristophanes_, Wasps 578., παίδων τοίνυν δοκιμαζομένων αἰδοῖα\r\nπάρεστι θεᾶσθαι.

At Rome likewise in cases of marriage disputes\r\nthe men were obliged to offer their genital organs for examination\r\n(_Quintilian_, Declam. 279.), a Law which was only revoked by\r\nJustinian. Comp. _Gundlingiana_ No. 23. pp. 342 sqq. We learn from\r\n_Plato_, Theaetet. 151., ποίαν χρῆ ποίῳ ἀνδρὶ συνοῦσαν ὡς ἀρίστους\r\nπαῖδας τίκτειν, (what sort of maid must mate with what sort of man\r\nto produce as fine children as may be), that the marriageable girls\r\nwere examined by the midwives,—a procedure that Plato wished to see\r\nuniversally introduced in his ideal State (De legg. bk. XII.). But\r\nagainst this _Theodoretus_, Contra Graecos bk. IX., declaims vigorously.\r\n\r\n[274] In any case it is an error to suppose that by this it is implied\r\nthat the maidens and young men were absolutely naked. They were merely\r\nμονόπεπλοι (single-frocked), clothed in a single short frock, slit\r\nup at the hips, for which reason they were also known by the name\r\nφαινομηρίδες (showing the thighs) (_Pollux_, Onomastic. VII. 55.), a\r\ncostume which was pretty much the general Doric one; thus _Moeris_ says\r\nδωριάζειν τὸ παραγυμνοῦσθαί τινα μέρη, (to follow Dorian fashions,\r\nto expose certain parts).

The meaning of γυμνὸς is\r\nnothing more than “lightly clad”, in mere underclothing, without outer\r\ncloak. So _Eubulus_, (Athenaeus bk. XIII. p. 568.) says, speaking of\r\nthe brothel-girls, γυμνάς—ἐν λεπτονήτοις ὑμέσιν ἑστωτας (standing\r\n“naked”—in light-spun garments). _Aelian_, Var. hist. XIII. 37., ἐν\r\nχιτωνίσκῳ γυμνὸς, (“naked” in a tunic). Similarly _nudus_ (naked) in\r\nLatin, as _Cuper_ (Observat. bk. I. ch. 7.) long ago pointed out,\r\noften has no other meaning, but merely stands for _tunicatus_ (clad\r\nin the tunic), in tunic only, without cloak or toga. We see this very\r\nclearly in _Petronius_, Satir. 55., Aequum est induere nuptam ventum\r\ntextilem,—Palam prostare nudam in nebula linea. (’Tis right a bride\r\nshould put on woven wind,—that she should stand openly for sale,\r\n“naked” in a linen cloud!) In precisely the same way the Jews use their\r\nword עָרֹם (arôm), Isaiah Ch. XX. 2., Job Ch. XXIV. 7. 10. I Samuel\r\nch. XIX. 24., and the Arabs مسلوخ (mesluch).\r\n\r\n[275] _Plato_, Republic, bk. II. p. 405. The Speech of _Lysias_ Ὑπὲρ\r\nΦανίου contains a passage, preserved for us by _Athenaeus_, bk. XII. p.\r\n552., in which these principles are expressed in Court, to induce the\r\nJudges to condemn the dissolute Cinesias: τοῦτον δὲ τὸν ὑπὸ πλείστων\r\nγινωσκόμενον οἱ θεοὶ οὕτως διέθεσαν, ὥστε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς αὐτοῦ βούλεσθαι\r\nζῆν μᾶλλον ἢ τεθνάναι, παράδειγμα τοῖς ἄλλοις, ἵν’ ἴδωσιν ὅτι τοῖς ἄλλοις\r\nὑβριστικῶς πρὸς τὰ θεῖα διακειμένοις, οὐκ εἰς τοὺς παῖδας ἀποτίθενται\r\nτὰς τιμωρίας, ἀλλ’ αὐτοὺς κακῶς ἀπολύουσι, μείζους καὶ χαλεπωτέρας,\r\nκαὶ τὰς νόσους, ἢ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀνθρώποις, προσβάλλοντες· τὸ μὲν γὰρ\r\nἀποθανεῖν ἢ καμεῖν νομίμως κοινὸν ἅπασιν ὑμῖν ἐστίν· τὸ δ’ οὕτως ἔχοντα\r\nτοσοῦτον χρόνον διατελεῖν, καὶ καθ’ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν ἀποθνήσκοντα μὴ\r\nδύνασθαι τελευτῆσαι τὸν βίον, τούτοις μόνοις, προσήκει τοῖς τὰ τοιαῦτα,\r\nἅπερ οὗτος, ἐξημαρτηκόσιν. (But this man, who is known to most of you,\r\nthe gods have brought to such a pass that his enemies may well wish him\r\nto live rather than die, to be an example to other men, showing them\r\nthat where men’s conduct is too violently overbearing towards the gods,\r\nthese do not inflict punishments on their children, but pay them out in\r\nperson with misfortunes, bringing down on them calamities and diseases\r\ngreater and more severe than fall to the lot of others. For death and\r\nsickness are admittedly common to all of you; but to continue so long\r\nin such a condition, and dying every day, yet not be able to have\r\ndone with his life, this is the fate only of men who have committed\r\nsuch evil deeds as he has). Again, the Taxili, an Indian people,\r\nregarded any bodily sickness as disgraceful, and on its appearance gave\r\nthemselves to the fire; αἴσχιστον δ’ αὐτοῖς νομίζεσθαι νόσον σωματικήν·\r\nτὸν δ’ ὑπονοήσαντα καθ’ αὑτοῦ τοῦτο ἐξάγειν ἑαυτὸν διὰ πυρὸς νήσαντα\r\nπυράν, (But they hold a bodily disease to be most disgraceful; and the\r\nman who has formed a suspicion of the existence of such in himself,\r\ngoes through the fire, after making a funeral pyre) says _Strabo_,\r\nGeograph. bk. XV. p. 716. 65. We should compare with this the suicide\r\nof Festus spoken of above and of the “Municeps” _Pliny_ tells of.\r\n\r\n[276] _Aretaeus_, De caus. et sign. chron. morb. (On the Causes and\r\nSymptoms of Chronic Diseases), bk. II. ch. 5., says indeed explicitly\r\nof gonorrhœa: ἀνώλεθρον μὲν ἡ γονόῤῥοια, _ἀτερπὲς δὲ καὶ ἀηδὲς μέσφι\r\nἀκοῆς_, (Gonorrhœa is not indeed a dangerous complaint, but it is\r\none that is hateful and abominable of repute).\r\n\r\n[277] _Martial_, bk. VI. Epigr. 31.,\r\n\r\n    Uxorem, Charideme, tuam scis ipse sinisque\r\n    _A medico futui_. Vis sine febre mori!\r\n\r\n(Your wife, Charidemus, you know _to be entered by the doctor_ of your\r\nown knowledge, and suffer it. You are fain to die without a fever!)\r\nSimilar instances occurred equally in the time of Hippocrates, as we\r\ngather from the oath, in which stands the clause: εἰς οἰκίας δὲ ὁκόσας\r\nἂν ἐσίω, ἐσελεύσομαι ἐπ’ ὠφελείῃ καμνόντων, ἐκτὸς ἐὼν πάσης ἀδικίης\r\nἑκουσίης καὶ φθορίης τῆς τε ἄλλης, καὶ _ἀφροδισίων ἔργων, ἐπί τε\r\nγυναικείων σωμάτων καὶ ἀνθρώπων ἐλευθέρων τε καὶ δούλων_. (Also into\r\nwhatsoever houses I enter, I will go in there for the succour of sick\r\npersons, devoid of all voluntary offence and all evil-doing, and above\r\nall of all amorous practices, whether on the persons of women or free\r\nmen or slaves). At the same time we learn from this document, that even\r\nthen paederastia was wide-spread enough already, and that physicians\r\nwere actually not ashamed to abuse their patients in this, as in other\r\nvicious ways! Undoubtedly it is from no other reason that the Turk\r\nat this very moment will rather expire than allow a clyster to be\r\nadministered to him.\r\n\r\n[278] _Martial_, bk. II. Epigr. 40.,\r\n\r\n    Omnes Tongilium medici iussere lavari,\r\n    O stulti! febrem creditis esse? gula est.\r\n\r\n(All the doctors ordered Tongilius to bathe; fools! think you it is a\r\nfever? it is gluttony that is the matter). Comp. bk. XI. Epigr. 87.\r\n\r\n[279] _Galen_, Method. medendi, bk. VIII. ch. 6., edit.

For this\r\nreason it was called διάτριτον θεσσαλείον (Thessalus’ _diatriton_),\r\nand the physicians who held to it διατριτάριοι ἰατροὶ (doctors of the\r\n_diatriton_), as we gather from the subsequent statement of _Galen_.\r\nOf the ephemera in case of buboes _Galen_ also speaks, ad Glauconem\r\nmeth. med. bk. I. ch. 2., edit. Kühn Vol. XI. p. 6., καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ βουβῶσι\r\nδὲ πυρετοὶ τούτου τοῦ γένους εἰσὶ, πλὴν εἰ μὴ χωρὶς ἕλκους φανεροῦ\r\nγένοιντο, (Moreover the fevers that follow on buboes are of this kind,\r\nthe exception being if they have not been without open ulceration).\r\n_Celsus_ moreover, De re med. bk. VI. ch. 18., says à propos of\r\ndiseases of the genitals, that he means to undertake their description,\r\nquia in vulgus eorum curatio praecipue cognoscenda est, quae\r\ninvitissimus quisque alteri ostendit, (because a general acquaintance\r\nis particularly desirable with the means of curing such complaints as\r\nevery man is most reluctant to make known to another).\r\n\r\n[280] _Galen_, Meth. med., bk. XIII. ch. 5. p. 881., οὕτως οὖν\r\nκαὶ δι’ ἕλκος ἐν δακτύλῳ γινόμενον ἤτοι ποδὸς ἢ χειρὸς οἱ κατὰ τὸν\r\nβουβῶνα καὶ τὴν μασχάλην ἀδένες ἐξαίρονταί τε καὶ φλεγμαίνουσι, τοῦ\r\nκαταῤῥέοντος ἐπ’ ἄκρον τὸν κῶλον  αἵματος ἀπολαβόντες πρῶτοι· καὶ κατὰ\r\nτράχηλον δὲ καὶ παρ’ ὦτα πολλάκις ἐξῄρθησαν ἀδένες, ἑλκῶν γενομένων\r\nἤτοι κατὰ τὴν κεφαλὴν ἢ τὸν τράχηλον ἤ τι τῶν πλησίων μορίων·\r\nὀνομάζουσι δὲ τοὺς οὕτως ἐξαρθέντας ἀδένας βουβῶνας.

Bernhold,\r\nStrasburg 1786., p. 2., writes in his Introduction to the Callistus:\r\nSiquidem verum est, antiquos herbis ac radicibus eorum corporis vitia\r\ncurasse: quia etiam tunc genus mortalium _inter initia non facile\r\nse ferro committebat_.

(If in fact it is\r\ntrue that the Ancients cured the diseases of their bodies by means of\r\nherbs and roots: for even then the race of mortals _at the beginning\r\ndid not readily entrust its cure to the knife_. And this is what even\r\nnow the most part do; and, unless constrained by a sore need and by the\r\nhope of actual recovery, do not suffer operations to be performed on\r\nthem, which in very deed are hardly to be endured).\r\n\r\n[287] _Galen_, Method. medendi bk.

In fact he answers this question in the\r\naffirmative so far as regards semen and menstrual blood, appealing to\r\nthe poisonous quality of the spittle of dogs in rabies.\r\n\r\n[292] _Heyne_, De febribus epidemicis Romae falso in pestium censum\r\nrelatis Progr., (On certain Epidemic Fevers at Rome incorrectly\r\nreferred to the Category of Plagues,—a Graduation Exercise), Göttingen\r\n1782., p. 4.

(For indeed this was the cause which\r\nwithdrew and kept back Antiquity generally from a more precise\r\nacquaintance with nature and so with diseases, viz. that everything\r\nwhich regarded the more intimate knowledge of it, and above all\r\neverything that was somewhat out of the common course of things, became\r\na matter of religious scruples and superstition). Comp. _C. F. H.\r\nMarx_, Origines Contagii, (Original Causes of Contagion) Carlrühe and\r\nBaden 1824.\r\n\r\n[293] As a rule they ascribed the origin of the contagion to σῆψις\r\n(putrefaction), and from their point of view septic, or putrefactive,\r\ndiseases were pretty much the same as infectious (_Galen_, De febr.\r\ndiff. I. 4.). Hence it would seem probable the ἕλκεα σηπεδόνα\r\n(putrefying ulcers) were at any rate partly looked at in the same\r\nlight,—a circumstance of the highest importance as bearing on ulcers of\r\nthe genitals, as in that case these latter are manifestly represented\r\nas being infectious. It is to be hoped that experts will give their\r\ndecision as to this. At any rate as early as _Galen’s_ time (De locis\r\neffect. bk. VI. ch. 5., edit. Kühn Vol. VIII. p. 422.) the action of\r\ncontagion was regarded as analogous to that of the electric ray-fish\r\n(νάρκη θαλάττιος) and the magnet, and the conclusion was drawn: ταῦτά\r\nτε οὖν ἱκανὰ τεκμήρια τοῦ σμικρὰν οὐσίαν ἀλλοιώσεις μεγίστας ἐργάζεσθαι\r\nμόνῳ τῷ ψαῦσαι. (these then are sufficient evidences of the fact that a\r\nsmall creature may produce very great variations by contact alone).\r\n\r\n[294] These were treated by the female physicians (αἱ ἰατρίναι),\r\n_Galen_, De loc. effect. VI. 5., Vol. VIII. p. 414. and the midwives,\r\nwho had to examine the female genitals in cases of disease affecting\r\nthem, and report the results to the Physicians. Σκέψασθαι κέλευσον τὴν\r\nμαῖαν ἁψαμένην τοῦ τῆς μήτρας αὐχένος, (bid the midwife examine by\r\ntouch the neck of the womb), _Galen_ says, loco citato p. 433.\r\n\r\n[295] _Galen_, De morborum causis, ch. 9., edit.

He says\r\nexplicitly: “However I do not propose to follow up to its original\r\ncause the history either of gonorrhœa, valuable as the results might\r\nbe, nor that of any other complaint liable to occur. It is sufficient\r\nfor my purpose to elucidate my Authorities for Venereal disease at its\r\nfirst appearance from the circumstances of their epoch, though no doubt\r\nincidentally the eye must sometimes take a wider sweep and look further\r\nand higher.”\r\n\r\n[298] _Galen_, De loc. affect, bk.

(for how great a force in the way of stimulating\r\nthe secretion of the surrounding glands is exerted by the species\r\nof spasm of the parts that follows on amatory action, you may learn\r\nfrom the seizures in the more serious forms of epilepsy, as also from\r\nthe affection which is known as gonorrhœa. For in violent epileptic\r\nseizures, because the whole body is strongly convulsed, and with it the\r\nprocreative parts, for this reason the semen is secreted; whereas in\r\ngonorrhœas the affection is one solely of the actual seminal vessels.\r\nAccordingly whatever tension these parts undergo in the diseases\r\nmentioned is the same in degree as they experience on secreting semen\r\nin acts of sexual intercourse).

II. ch. 5.,\r\nἈνώλεθρον μὲν ἡ γονόῤῥοια, _ἀτερπὲς δὲ καὶ ἀηδὲς μέσφι ἀκοῆς_· ἣν\r\nγὰρ ἀκρασίη καὶ _πάρεσις_ τὰ ὑγρὰ ἴσχῃ καὶ γόνιμα μέρεα, ὅκως διὰ\r\nψυχρῶν ῥέει ἡ θορὴ, οὐδὲ ἐπισχεῖν ἐστὶ αὐτὴν οὐδὲ ἐν ὕπνοισι· ἀλλὰ\r\nγὰρ ἤν τε εὕδῃ, ἤν τε ἐγρηγορέῃ, ἀνεπίσχετος ἡ φορὴ, ἀναίσθητος δὲ ἡ\r\nῥοὴ τοῦ γόνου γίγνεται· _νοσέουσι δὲ καὶ γυναῖκες τήνδε τὴν νοῦσον_,\r\nἀλλ’ ἐπὶ κνησμοῖσι τῶν μορίων καὶ ἡδονῇ προχέεται τῇσι ἡ θορή· ἀτὰρ\r\nκαὶ πρὸς ἄνδρας ὁμιλίῃ ἀναισχύντῳ· ἄνδρες δὲ οὐδ’ ὅλως ὀδάξονται·\r\nτὸ δὲ ῥέον ὑγρὸν λεπτὸν, ψυχρὸν,  ἄχρουν, ἄγονον· πῶς γὰρ ζωογόνον\r\nἐκπέμψαι σπέρμα ψυχρὴ οὖσα ἡ φύσις· ἢν δὲ καὶ νέοι πάσχωσι, γηραλέους\r\nχρὴ γενέσθαι πάντας τὴν ἕξιν, νωθώδεας, ἐκλύτους, ἀψύχους, ὀκνέοντας,\r\nκωφούς, ἀσθενέας, ῥικνούς, ἀπρήκτους, ἐπώχρους, λευκοὺς, γυναικώδεας,\r\nἀποσίτους, ψυχροὺς, μελέων βάρεα, καὶ νάρκας σκελέων, ἀκρατέας, καὶ ἐς\r\nπάντα παρέτους· ἥδε ἡ νοῦσος ὁδὸς ἐς παράλυσιν πολλοῖσι γίγνεται· πῶς\r\nγὰρ οὐκ ἂν τῶν νεύρων ἥδε ἡ δύναμις πάθοι τῆς ἐς ζωῆς γένεσιν φύσιος\r\nἀπεψυγμένης. (Gonorrhœa is not indeed a dangerous thing, but it _is_ a\r\ndisagreeable one, and one that is _in the highest degree unseemly in\r\nrepute_. For if incontinence and _paresis_ attack the soft procreative\r\nparts, the semen flows all the same even though the organs are cold,\r\nnor is it possible to stop it even in sleep; for whether a man sleep,\r\nor wake, the running is continual, and the flow of the seed goes on\r\nunconsciously. _And women also are subject to this complaint_; but in\r\ntheir case the discharge of the semen is accompanied with itchings and\r\nwith pleasurable feeling, as well as with shameless intercourse with\r\nmen, whereas men are not in any way excited. And the moisture that\r\nis discharged is thin, cold, colourless, unfruitful; for how should\r\nits nature, that is cold, send forth fertile semen? And if young\r\nmen suffer from it, they are bound to grow old in constitution and\r\ncondition, sluggish, relaxed, lifeless, hesitating, dull of hearing,\r\nweak, shrunken, ineffectual, pallid, white, womanish, without appetite,\r\nchilly, heavy of limb, and stiff of leg and palsied in every part. This\r\ncomplaint is the avenue to paralysis for many; for how should this\r\npower of the nerves not suffer when the natural parts pertaining to the\r\ngeneration of life are chilled).\r\n\r\n[315] _Celsus_ De re med. bk. IV. ch. 21., Est etiam circa naturalia\r\nvitium, nimia profusio seminis, quod sine venere, sine nocturnis\r\nimaginibus sic fertur, ut interposito spatio, tabe hominem consumat.\r\n(There is another complaint connected with the private parts, viz.\r\nexcessive discharge of semen, which apart altogether from love, and\r\napart from nocturnal pollutions in dreams, is so persistent that, given\r\na sufficient interval of time, it destroys a man by wasting).\r\n\r\n[316] _Alexander of Tralles_, bk. IV. ch. 9., δέονται γὰρ οὗτοι τῶν\r\nἐπικιρνώντων καὶ ἐμψυχόντων πάνυ καὶ λουτρῶν εὐκράτων· ὥστε παχυνθεῖσαν\r\nἠρέμα τὴν γονὴν καὶ εὔκρατον γενομένην, μηκέτι φέρεσθαι. (For these\r\npatients require compound and very cooling drugs, and lukewarm baths;\r\nso that the seed growing quietly thicker and well-conditioned, may no\r\nlonger flow away).\r\n\r\n[317] _Galen_, Definit. medic. n. 288. (XIX. p. 426.), Γονόῤῥοιά\r\nἐστιν ἀπόκρισις ἐπιφέρουσα σπέρματος νόσημα μετὰ τοῦ τήκεσθαι τὸ σῶμα\r\nκαὶ ἀχρούστερον ἀποτελεῖσθαι· γίνεται δὲ ἀτονησάντων τῶν σπερματικῶν\r\nἀγγείων, ὥστε τρόπον τινὰ παρειμένων αὐτῶν μὴ κρατεῖσθαι τὸ σπέρμα.\r\n(Gonorrhœa is a discharge producing a diseased state of semen\r\naccompanied by wasting of the body and an unhealthy-looking complexion;\r\nand it arises through the semen vessels having become atonic, so that,\r\nthese being in a way paralysed, the semen is not retained).\r\n\r\n[318] _Actuarius_, Method. med. bk. I. ch. 22., Et in seminis quidem\r\nprofluvio, neque coles intenditur, neque aeger eadem qua sanus\r\nafficitur voluptate, sed perinde ac si superfluum quiddam excerneretur,\r\nsensu privatur. Quod si morbus moram traxerit, necesse est ut aeger\r\nin colliquationem collabatur ac pereat; quod pinguior humoris portio\r\neiiciatur ac vitalis spiritus non parum una effluat. (Moreover in\r\nthis excessive flux of semen, neither is the member erected, nor does\r\nthe patient experience the same pleasure as he does in health, but\r\nexactly as though something superfluous were being eliminated, he is\r\nrobbed of sensation. But if the malady runs a more protracted course,\r\nthe sufferer cannot but fall into collapse and succumb, inasmuch as\r\nthe richer portion of the humour is ejaculated, and the vital spirit\r\nmust escape along with it). As early as _Hippocrates_, De morbis bk.\r\nII., edit. Kühn Vol. II. p. we read: ἡ νωτιὰς φθίσις ἀπὸ τοῦ μυελοῦ\r\nγίνεται· λαμβάνει δὲ μάλιστα νεογάμους καὶ φιλολάγνους ... καὶ ἐπὴν\r\nοὐρέῃ ἢ ἀποπατέῃ, προέρχεταί οἱ θορὸς πουλὺς καὶ ὑγρὸς, καὶ γενεὴ οὐκ\r\nἐγγίνεται, καὶ ὀνειρώσσει, κἂν συγκοιμηθῇ γυναικί, κἂν μή. (Spinal\r\nconsumption arises from the marrow; and it attacks particularly newly\r\nmarried men and lascivious subjects.... And every time the patient\r\nmakes water or evacuates, semen flows from him copious and wet, and\r\nhe does not succeed in generating, and has nocturnal pollutions,\r\nwhether he sleep with a woman or no). Ought this not to be referred to\r\ngonorrhœa?\r\n\r\n[319] _Aretaeus_, p. 424. loco citato; also De curat. morb. chron. bk.\r\nII. ch. 5., καὶ τοῦ ἀτερπέος τοῦ πάθεος εἵνεκεν καὶ τοῦ κατὰ σύντηξιν\r\nκινδυνώδεος καὶ τῆς ἐς διάδεξιν γένος χρείης λύειν χρὴ μὴ βραδέως\r\nτὴν γονόῤῥοιαν πάντων κακῶν οὖσαν αἰτίην· (Equally on account of the\r\ndisagreeable nature of the malady as on account of the risk of _tabes_\r\nor wasting and for the sake of the needful maintenance of posterity,\r\ngonorrhœa should be rapidly cured, being the cause of very many evils).\r\nTruly if not another passage remained to us from the Ancient writers\r\nbesides these two of Aretaeus’, they alone would suffice to convince us\r\nof the existence in his time of virulent gonorrhœa brought on by sexual\r\nintercourse; and it is quite inconceivable how _Simon_, Versuch einer\r\nkrit. Gesch. (Essay towards a Critical History), Bk. I. p. 24., can\r\nsay: “Thus for instance _all_ the symptoms, which Aretaeus mentions in\r\nhis Chapter on Gonorrhœa, speak for _true seminal flux_!”\r\n\r\n[320] _Theodorus Priscianus_, bk. II. logic, ch. 11., Satyriasis,\r\ngonorrhœa vel priapismus, quibus similis est sub immoderata patratione\r\nmolestia, his accidentibus disterminantur. Gonorrhœa sine veretri\r\nextensione vel usus venerii desiderio, spermatis affluentissima sub\r\neffusione corpora debilitat et per chronica tempora producitur.\r\n(Satyriasis, gonorrhœa or priapism, maladies involving similar\r\ninconvenience as in immoderate copulation, are distinguished by the\r\nfollowing particularities. Gonorrhœa without erection of the member\r\nor desire for the enjoyment of love, debilitates the body by a most\r\ncopious discharge of semen, and is protracted over chronic periods of\r\ntime).\r\n\r\n[321] _Julius Firmicus Maternus_, Astronomica bk. III. chs. 7 and 8.,\r\nIn loco octavo ♀ ab horoscopo constituto ... si ☿ cum ea fuerit vel\r\ncum ☿ Venerem in hoc loco positam, malevola stella respexerit, vel\r\nper quadratum vel diametrum, vel si cum ipsis, in hoc loco fuerit\r\ninventa, omne eius qui natus fuerit patrimonium dissipatur vel\r\nqualicunque proscriptione nudatur, _mors vero illi per gonorrheam_,\r\nid est _defluxionem seminis_, aut contractionem vel spasmum aut\r\napoplexin fertur. (In the eighth place determined by the horoscope\r\nstands ♀ Venus.... If ☿ (Mercury) be in conjunction with it, or if\r\nVenus standing in this place with ☿ (Mercury) be faced by an evil\r\nstar, whether by quadrate or diameter, or if such star is found in\r\nconjunction with them in this place, all the patrimony of him who has\r\nbeen born under this conjunction is wasted, or is lost utterly by some\r\nproscription or another, and _his death is brought about by gonorrhœa,\r\nthat is to say a flux of the semen_, or cramp or spasm or apoplexy.)\r\n\r\n[322] Caelius Aurelianus, Morb. Chron. bk. V. ch. 7., Item antecedens\r\ncausa supradictae passionis, quam _seminis_ appellamus _lapsum_,\r\nfuisse probatur, a qua discernitur, si quidem illa passio etiam per\r\ndiem vigilantibus aegris fluere facit semen, nulla phantasia in usum\r\nvenereum provocante. (Such is proved to have been another antecedent\r\ncause of the above named malady, which we call _discharge of semen_;\r\nbut a distinct cause has to be assigned, if it so be that the malady\r\nin question makes the semen flow even by day and when the patients\r\nare awake, and though no dream provokes to the exercise of love).\r\n_Philagrius_ appears to have made this distinction quite correctly,\r\nwhen as quoted by _Aëtius_ (Tetrab. III. serm. 3. ch. 34.), De seminis\r\nin somno profluvio, Philagrii (On the discharge of semen in sleep,\r\naccording to Philagrius), he says: Semen in somnis profundere dicuntur\r\nquicumque dum dormiunt, _naturae genitale semen_ emittunt, quod ipsum\r\neis ut plurimum ob vitiati humoris materiam, aut materiae multitudinem\r\naut ob partium seminalium robur contingit. Iam vero quidam et ob\r\nanimi moestitiam aut inediam, per somnos praeter consuetudinem semen\r\nexcreverunt, atque id materiae acrimonia irritati, non ob partium\r\nseminalium robur, pertulerunt etc. (They are said to discharge semen in\r\nsleep, whoever during slumber, ejaculate _the genital seed of nature_,\r\nbecause they possess it in the greatest degree of abundance either on\r\naccount of the constituting material of the semen being vitiated or\r\non account of the copiousness of this material, or else on account of\r\nthe vigour of the seminal organs. But there are also many cases where\r\nmen have emitted semen in sleep contrary to their wont in consequence\r\nof sadness of spirits or fasting, having done so because irritated\r\nby the acridness of the material, and not through any vigour of the\r\nseminal organs, etc.). The only pity is that Aëtius has not preserved\r\nfor us his (Philagrius’) opinion as to gonorrhœa, and has not shown\r\nclearly exactly what belongs to Philagrius in the Chapter; for a great\r\ndeal, as indeed is stated, is from Galen and referred by the compiler\r\nto gonorrhœa. Philagrius in fact only lived in the latter half of\r\nthe Fourth Century,—A.D. 364 according to Sprengel, 300 according to\r\nLessing.\r\n\r\n[323] _Actuarius_, Meth. med. bk. IV. ch. 8., Convenit ad haec reliqua\r\nvictus ratio, quae ad siccitatem declinet, sed non sit calidior, verum\r\nfrigida. Insuper nutriendus aeger est, viresque modice reficiendae;\r\nnamque ob continuam excretionem languet corpus et imbecillum est.\r\nQuies apta est, et balnea quae humectent tamen alioqui non sunt\r\nidonea. Animalia agrestia, quae refrigerantibus exsiccantibusque\r\ncondiantur, sunt accommodata et vinum pauculum tenueque. (Consistent\r\nwith this are the remaining rules of diet. This should incline towards\r\ndryness, but must not be at all hot, but cold. Further the sufferer\r\nmust be adequately nourished, and his strength fairly well kept up;\r\nfor owing to the constant ejaculation of semen the body grows languid\r\nand weak. Rest is desirable, and baths, in other circumstances used\r\nfor moistening the body, are not here advisable. Game, seasoned with\r\ncooling and desiccating condiments, is appropriate, and a little thin\r\nwine.)\r\n\r\n[324] _Celsus_, bk. IV. ch. 21. In hoc affectu salutares sunt\r\nvehementes frictiones, perfusiones natationesque quam frigidissimae.\r\n(In this complaint violent frictions are advantageous, also aspersions\r\nand plunge baths as cold as they can be borne).\r\n\r\n[325] _Galen_, De sanitate tuenda bk. VI. ch. 14. (VI. p. 444.),—The\r\nbest illustration in reference to the statements made in this\r\nconnection by _Aëtius_ (Tetrab. III. serm. 3. ch. 33.), which indeed\r\nis superscribed as Galen’s and draws most of its material from him\r\nand from Aretaeus, showing however in many ways that it was based on\r\npersonal observation or that the author had before him some better and\r\nolder authority. Unfortunately the passage, previously glanced at, was\r\nsubsequently mislaid by us, and so we are able merely to give it in a\r\nFootnote, with the request that the reader will complete from it what\r\nis said in the text. Profluvium igitur seminis, vasorum seminariorum\r\naffectio est, non pudendi, _quae dolorem quidem non ita valde inferre\r\nsolet, molestiam autem non vulgarem et_ pollutionem exhibet ob assiduum\r\net invitis contingentem seminis fluxum. Oboritur autem aliquando\r\netiam ex seminariorum vasorum fluxione, _quandoque etiam satyriasi\r\npraecedente profluvium seminis succedit_. Contingit autem affectio\r\nmaxime pubertatem transgressos citra decimum quartum annum, imo aliis\r\netiam aetatibus. Est autem semen quod profluit, aquosum, tenue, citra\r\nappetentiam coeundi et ut plurimum quidem citra sensum, quandoque vero\r\ncum voluptate quadam promanans. Corrumpitur affectis sensim universum\r\ncorpus ac gracilescit, praesertim circa lumbos. Consequitur et\r\ndebilitas multa, non ob multitudinem seminis profluentis sed ob locorum\r\nproprietatem. _Non solum autem viris sed et mulierculis hoc accidit,\r\net in feminis sane aegre tollitur._ Ceterum cura communis est cum ea\r\nquae in omni fluxione adhibetur. _Primum igitur in quiete et pauco\r\ncibo ac aquae potu affectos asservare oportet_; deinde etiam lumbos\r\net pubem contegere lanis vino et rosaceo aut oenanthino aut melino\r\nmadefactis. Neque vero ineptae sunt spongiae posca imputae. Sequentibus\r\nvero diebus cataplasmatis ex palmis, malis, acacia hypocisthide,\r\noenanthe, rhoe rubro et similibus. Insessibus item adstringentibus\r\nutendum est, ex lentisci, rubi, myrti et similium in vino austero sive\r\nmero sive diluto decocto. Cibis autem utendum qui aegre corrumpantur\r\net difficulter permutantur et resiccandi vim habent. Dandum etiam cum\r\npotu et cibis, viticis ac _cannabis_ semen praesertim tostum. Rutae\r\nitem semen ac folia, lactucae semen et cauliculi ac nymphaeae radix.\r\nIn potu vero quotidie pro communi aqua, _aqua in qua ferrum saepe\r\nextinctum est_ praebeatur. Quidam vero corticem radicis halicacabi ex\r\naqua eis bibendum praebuerunt, neque ineptum fuerit huius aliquando\r\npericulum facere. _Antidotus_ etiam _haec magnae celebritatis_ tum ad\r\nhoc modo semen profudentes, tum ad assidua in omnis profluvia commode\r\nexhibetur. Seminis salicis ʒvjj calaminthae ʒvj seminis viticis albae\r\nʒv rutae ʒjv seminis cicutae ʒjj cum aqua in pastillos digerito et\r\nex eis ad Ponticae nucis magnitudinem cum poscae cyathis tribus\r\npraebeto. _Omnem vero acrium rerum esum et multi vini potum_ et olerum\r\nexhibitionem _vitare oportet_, diaetam vero universam resiccatoriam et\r\nadstringentem constituere. Post prima autem mox tempora ad unctiones et\r\nexercitatricem diaetam transeundum, per quam totum corpus et praesertim\r\naffecta, ad sanitatem perducantur, et plurima quidem tempora circa\r\nunctiones immorandum, paucies vero lavandum, si aut lassitudini aut\r\ncruditati mederi velimus. Bonum fuerit etiam, _si nihil prohibuerit, ad\r\nfrigidae lavationem_ defugere, quae omnem morbum ex fluxione obortum\r\ndepellere consuevit, maxime si medicamentaria qualitate aqua praedita\r\nsit, velut sunt in Albulis aquae, quae etiam in potu acceptae eis summe\r\nprosunt. Sunt autem sapore subsalso et tactu lactei teporis. Convenit\r\nitem per intervalla quaedam illitionibus et epithematis et malagmatis\r\nuti, quae rubefacere et emollire possint, atque ea quae in profundo\r\nhaerent ad superficiem transferre. _Decubitus_ porro _frequenter\r\nin latus fiat_, calaminthae foliis et rutae et viticis substratis.\r\nEpithema autem in eis usu venit hocce. Capillum Veneris multum\r\ncontundito et terito cum aceto aut apii succo aut seridis aut psyllii\r\neoque cochlearum carnes coctas excipito et simul in linteolum infarta\r\ncoxendicibus imponito. Utendum vero et praescripto ad priapismum\r\ncerato et iis quae paulo mox ad seminis in somno profluvia dicentur.\r\n_Omnem autem de rebus venereis cogitationem excludere oportet._ (Thus\r\nwe see excessive discharge of semen is an effection of the seminal\r\nvessels, not of the member. _This complaint does not indeed as a rule\r\ncause any very great pain, but it does occasion no ordinary degree\r\nof inconvenience_ and defilement in consequence of the constant\r\ninvoluntary discharge of semen. However sometimes it may arise from\r\na flux in the seminal vessels, and _occasionally on an antecedent\r\nattack of satyriasis profuse discharge of semen supervenes_. The malady\r\nparticularly attacks those who have passed the period of puberty but\r\nare under fourteen, but other ages are also liable. And the semen\r\nthat is discharged is watery, thin, the discharge being unaccompanied\r\nwith any desire for coition, and indeed as a rule without any feeling\r\nwhatever, though at times taking place with a certain voluptuous\r\nsensation. The whole body of those attacked suffers and becomes wasted,\r\nespecially in the lumbar region. There follows great weakness, not so\r\nmuch owing to the amount of the semen discharged as to the nature of\r\nthe parts affected. _Again, this disease is not peculiar to men, but\r\nassails young women as well, and in the case of females is eliminated\r\nwith very great difficulty._ However the treatment is the same as that\r\napplied in all fluxes. First of all therefore patients must observe\r\nrest and a scanty diet both in food and drinking water; then the loins\r\nand pubis should be covered with cloths moistened with wine, and\r\n_rosaceum_ and oenanthinum and melinum (oil of roses, of young vine\r\nbuds, of melilot). Sponges soaked in posca (acid drink of vinegar and\r\nwater) are also appropriate. Then on the succeeding days cataplasms\r\nof palms, apples, acacia, hypocisthis (parasitic plant growing on\r\nthe cisthus), wild vine, red wild-poppy, and the like. Embrocations\r\nmoreover should be employed of an astringent character, consisting\r\nof a decoction of the mastic, bramble, myrtle and the like, in hard\r\nwine, whether unmixed or diluted. Diet should embrace such foods as\r\nresist corruption and deterioration, and possess a desiccative quality.\r\nAlong with the food and drink should be administered the juice of the\r\nagnus castus and of _hemp_, especially after boiling. Also the juice\r\nand leaves of rue, the juice of lettuce and colewort and the root of\r\nnymphaea (water-lily). As to drink for daily use, instead of ordinary\r\nwater, water should be given in which _iron has been repeatedly\r\ntempered_. Some practitioners indeed have administered the bark of the\r\nroot of the bladder-wort in water as a beverage for such patients,\r\nand it will not be inappropriate to make trial of this on occasion.\r\nAnother _antidote of great renown_ is exhibited with advantage both for\r\nsufferers from this discharge of semen, as well as for constant fluxes\r\nof all kinds. Take of juice of the sallow Ʒvjj, of calamint Ʒvj, of\r\njuice of the white agnus castus Ʒv, of rue Ʒjv, of juice of hemlock\r\nƷjj; compound with water into small cakes or lozenges, and administer\r\none of these of the size of a hazel-nut along with three cups of posca\r\n(vinegar and water). _But the patient must avoid all eating of acrid\r\nthings and the drinking of much wine_ and the use of vegetables; the\r\ndiet must be generally of a desiccative and astringent type. Moreover\r\npresently after the earlier stages embrocations and an active mode\r\nof life should be adopted, whereby the whole body and particularly\r\nthe parts affected are brought into a healthy state; the embrocations\r\nshould be persevered in for long periods of time, but washing on the\r\nother hand sparingly employed, if we wish to remedy the lassitude and\r\nacrid habit of body. It will be of advantage moreover, _if there is\r\nnothing to prevent, to have recourse to cold bathing_, which has the\r\nproperty of expelling all diseases arising from flux, more especially\r\nif the water is endowed with a healing quality, such as the waters of\r\nAlbulae, which also are of the greatest use in these cases when taken\r\nas a drink. They are of a slightly salt taste, and of a milky warmth to\r\nthe touch. Further, it is suitable to employ at intervals lotions and\r\npoultices and plasters, such as will redden and soften the skin, and\r\nbring to the surface those matters that lie latent underneath. Again,\r\n_rest should frequently be taken lying on the side_, the leaves of\r\ncalamint and rue and agnus castus being spread as a couch. A poultice\r\nemployed in these cases is as follows. Pound a quantity of Venus-hair\r\nand rub it up with vinegar or parsley juice or that of endive or\r\nfleabane, add to it the cooked meat of snails, pack all together in a\r\nlinen cloth and lay upon the hips. Also the wax plaster prescribed for\r\npriapism should be employed, and the remedies to be mentioned presently\r\nfor discharges of semen during sleep. Lastly _all thinking about love\r\nought to be avoided_.)\r\n\r\n[326] Similarly _Aretaeus_, Morb. chron. therap. bk. II. ch. 5., says:\r\nεἰ δὲ καὶ σώφρων ἔοι ἐπὶ τοῖσι ἀφροδισίοισι καὶ λούοιτο ψυχρῷ, ἐλπὶς\r\nὡς ὤκιστα ἀνδρωθῆναι τὸν ἄνθρωπον, (And if he indulge with moderation\r\nin love and bathe in cold water, there is good hope that the man will\r\nrapidly recover manly vigour). This need surprise us the less, if we\r\nremember that the notion of a superfluitas seminis (superfluity of\r\nseed),—this was why Diogenes practised onanism, _Galen_, Vol. VIII. p.\r\n419.,—was all the time in the background, and gonorrhœa according to\r\nCaelius Aurelianus and other authorities actually arose from too great\r\nself-continence. Si igitur Venerem exercere consueverit et crebriore\r\nuti concubitu, nunc autem continentius et purius innocentiusque degat,\r\nsine dubio a copia id sustinet cum partes illam ferre nequeunt. (If\r\ntherefore a man is in the habit of practising love and indulging in\r\nfairly frequent cohabitation, well and good; but if on the contrary\r\nhe live a too continent, pure and innocent life, without a doubt he\r\nendures this evil from the over-copiousness (of semen), as the parts\r\ncannot tolerate it.) This idea owed its origin partly to the confusion\r\nof gonorrhoea with nocturnal pollutions,—a confusion found even in the\r\npassage from Galen quoted a little above, and in especial was revived\r\nin the XVth. and XVIth. Centuries under the auspices of the monks and\r\nnuns. It at the same time gave occasion to the practice of resorting to\r\ncopulation with a maiden as a cure for gonorrhœa. At any rate it was an\r\nopinion already found in Hippocrates, that copulation was a desiccative\r\nmeasure which in diseases arising from the phlegmatic humour\r\n(_Hippocrates_, Epidem. bk. VI. Vol. III. p. 609., _Galen_, XVII. A. p.\r\n284.) is of advantage to hot and moist constitutions (_Galen_, Vol. VI.\r\np. 402.)\r\n\r\n[327] _Galen_, De sympt. caus. bk. III. ch. 11. (VII. p. 265.), ἀλλὰ\r\nκαὶ τὰ μοχθηρὰ διὰ τῶν ὑστερῶν ῥεύματα, καλεῖται δὲ _τὸ σύμπτωμα_ ῥοῦς\r\nγυναικεῖος, ἐκκαθαιρομένου κατὰ τοῦτο τὸ μόριον ἅπαντος τοῦ σώματος\r\nγίγνεται. (Besides there are the troublesome fluxes by way of the womb;\r\nand the _symptom_ of these is known as “female discharge”, and takes\r\nplace as the whole body purges itself by this part). _Nonnus_, ch. 204.\r\n_Paulus Aegineta_, bk. II. ch. 63. _Rufus_ of Ephesus, bk. I ch. 44.\r\n\r\n[328] _Aretaeus_, De sign, chron. morb. bk. IV. ch. 11., ἄλλος ῥόος\r\nλευκὸς ἡ ἐπιμήνιος κάθαρσις λευκὴ δριμεῖα καὶ ὀδαξώδης ἐς ἡδονήν.\r\nἐπὶ δὲ τοῖσι καὶ ὑγροῦ λευκοῦ, πάχεος, γονοειδέος πρόκλησις· τόδε τὸ\r\nεἶδος _γονόρῤῥοιαν γυναικείαν ἐλέξαμεν_· ἔστι δὲ τῆς ὑστέρης φύξις,\r\nοὕνεκεν ἀκρατὴς τῶν ὑγρῶν γίγνεται· ἀτὰρ καὶ τὸ αἷμα ἐς χροιὴν λευκὴν\r\nἀμείβει. (Another white discharge is the menstrual purging, white,\r\nacrid, and provoking a pleasurable itching. But in addition to these\r\nforms there is also a calling out of a moist, white, thick, semen-like\r\ndischarge; and this species we have named “_female gonorrhœa_”; and\r\nit is an escape from the womb, because this cannot retain the moist\r\nhumours. Further, it actually changes the blood to a white colour.)\r\nPerhaps too what _Galen_, De semine bk. II. ch. 1. (IV. p. 599.), says\r\nis pertinent in this connection: ταῖς δ’ ἄλλαις ἔλαττόν τε καὶ ὑγρὸν\r\nἐκπίπτον φαίνεται πολλάκις ἔσωθεν ἐξ αὐτῶν τῶν ὑστερῶν, ἵναπερ οὐρεῖ.\r\n(but in other women there appears to be a smaller and moist discharge\r\nvery often, inside, coming from the womb itself, in micturition). Again\r\n_Theod. Priscianus_, bk. III. 10., says: Aliquando etiam spermatis\r\nspontanei et importuni fluxu feminae fatigantur, quod Graeci gonorrhœam\r\nappellant. (Sometimes too women are troubled with a discharge of\r\ninvoluntarily and unexpectedly emitted semen, a complaint the Greeks\r\ncall gonorrhœa.) Comp. the passage quoted above from Aëtius.\r\n\r\n[329] _Celsus_, De re medica bk. VI. ch. 18., Solet etiam interdum ad\r\n_nervos_ ulcus descendere; profluitque pituita multa sanies tenuis\r\nmalique odoris, non coacta at aquae similis, in qua caro recens lota\r\nest; doloresque is locus et punctiones habet. Id genus quamvis inter\r\npurulenta est, tamen lenibus medicamentis curandum est.... Praecipueque\r\nid ulcus multa calida aqua fovendum est, velandumque neque frigori\r\ncommittendum. (Moreover the ulcer is wont sometimes to descend to the\r\n_cords_; and then there is discharged a quantity of phlegm, a thin\r\n_sanies_ of an ill odour, not congealed but like water in which a\r\npiece of fresh meat has been washed; and the place experiences pain\r\nand a pricking sensation. This sort, though it comes under the head of\r\npurulent complaints, should nevertheless be treated with mild drugs....\r\nAnd above all this form of ulcer should be fomented with copious\r\nwarm water, and should be covered and not exposed to cold). From the\r\nlast sentence it may be concluded that it is not the acute form of\r\nblennorrhœa of the urethra that is in question here (bk. IV), but the\r\nchronic. The words _ad nervos_ (to the cords) have given occasion\r\nto some very extraordinary explanations. _Simon_, Krit. Gesch. Vol.\r\nI p. 23., considers it would be most natural to refer this to the\r\ninside of the member, to the urethra in fact, though as a matter of\r\nfact gonorrhœa of the glans penis might just as likely be intended in\r\nthe passage. But in the latter case the interpretation is absolutely\r\nimpossible, as the glans penis is never called _nervus_. The corpora\r\ncavernosa it is true are described in several places by _Galen_, e. g.\r\nDe loc. aff. bk. VI. ch. 6., as “a pipe-like cord, for the body is\r\ncord-like in form, the whole being hollow like a pipe”, but he adds\r\nχωρὶς τῆς καλουμένης βαλάνου (always excepting the glans penis, as it\r\nis called), and indeed that _nervus_ generally signifies the penis is\r\nevident at once from Horace, Epod. XII. 19.; even the plural _nervos_\r\nis found in _Petronius_, Sat. 129., 134.,—so the Greeks similarly\r\nuse νεῦρον (nerve, cord) for the penis, sometimes with the addition\r\nσπερματικὸν (spermatic, seminal), as Eustathius points out,—Comm. on\r\nthe Iliad, X. 1390. However Celsus had no idea of this in his mind;\r\neverything shows that with him the _ad nervos_ points to nothing but\r\nthe _vasa deferentia_ or spermatic cords, as he distinctly declares\r\nhimself in bk. VII. ch. 18: Dependent vero (testiculi) ab inguinibus\r\nper _singulos nervos_, quos κρεμαστῆρας Graeci nominant. (But the\r\ntesticles hang from the groin by separate cords, which the Greeks call\r\nκρεμαστῆρες,—suspenders). Similarly _Columella_, De re rustic. bk. VI.\r\nch. 26., Testium nervos, quos Graeci κρεμαστῆρας ab eo appellant, quod\r\nex illis genitales partes dependent. (The cords of the testicles, which\r\nthe Greeks name κρεμαστῆρες,—suspenders, because the genital parts\r\nhang by them); again _Pollux_, Onomast. bk. II. Ch. 4., κρεμαστῆρας δὲ\r\nλέγονται τὰ νεῦρα, τοῦς διδύμους ἀνέχει. (κρεμαστῆρες,—suspenders, is\r\nthe name of the cords; and they support the testicles). The possibility\r\nof the suppuration extending to the seed reservoir and the spermatic\r\ncords is proved by the case lately observed and made known by _Ricord_.\r\n\r\n[330] _Actuarius_, Method. med. bk. IV. ch. 8., Caeterum non est\r\nignorandum, nonnunquam in interna penis parte exiguum tuberculum\r\noboriri, quod dum disrumpitur, sanguinem aut exiguum puris effundit;\r\nquare quidam arbitrantur ex profundo ea prodire, citraque rationem\r\nmetuere coeperunt. Verum res ex penis dolore deprehenditur. Venae autem\r\nsectione sola, victuque frigidiusculo aegrum a molestia vindicavimus.\r\n_Quod si vitium moram traxerit et vulnus_ (ἕλκος?) _altius pervenerit_,\r\nenemata morsus expertia, qualibus in lippitudine utimur, infundimus.\r\nBalneo ac omni mordenti evidenterque calefaciente tum cibo tum potione\r\nabstinemus, ita namque promptius aeger valetudinem recipit. (However it\r\nmust not be forgotten that sometimes a small tubercle is established in\r\nthe internal part of the penis, which on bursting discharges blood and\r\na small quantity of pus; for which reason some suppose these symptoms\r\nto proceed from a deep-seated evil, and have been unreasonably alarmed.\r\nBut the truth may be gathered from the pain in the penis. However by\r\nthe mere opening of a vein and a cooling diet we have saved a patient\r\nfrom all inconvenience. On the other hand if the mischief has followed\r\na protracted course and the sore (ἕλκος?,—ulcer) has penetrated farther\r\nin, we introduce clysters free from biting acridity, such as we make\r\nuse of for blear-eyed patients. We forbid the bath, and everything\r\nacrid and manifestly heating whether in food or drink, for in this way\r\nthe sufferer recovers his health more rapidly).\r\n\r\n[331] _Paulus Aegineta_, bk. III. ch. 59., εἰ δὲ κατὰ τὸν καυλὸν\r\nἔνδον τῆς τοῦ αἰδοίου τρήσεως ἀφανὲς ἕλκος γένηται, γινώσκεται ἐκ\r\nτοῦ πύον ἢ αἷμα κενοῦσθαι χωρὶς οὐρησέως.

(But if in the canal within the\r\nperforation of the member an invisible ulcer arise, it is recognized\r\nfrom the fact of matter or blood being discharged without micturition.\r\nAnd it is treated first by being _rinsed_ with a weak honey-mixture,\r\nand then with milk and afterwards by mixing with the milk the salve of\r\nthe _aster atticus_, or the white lozenge, or a preparation of lotus\r\npounded in a leaden mortar; _a feather_ should be dipped in this and\r\nit should be rubbed on, or else _a piece of thin material made into a\r\ntwist_ should be smeared with it and the drug introduced by this means;\r\nbut the best of all is by taking equal parts of gall-apple, flowers of\r\nzinc, starch-flour and aloes smeared with rose-sap and plantain-sap).\r\n\r\n[332] _Caelius Aurelianus_, Morb. chron. bk.

(For they suffer either because the bladder is\r\nunable to secrete or because its orifice is stopped; but both these\r\ncomplaints of the bladder have one symptom in common, viz. retention of\r\nurine.... Now the _stoppages_ of the orifice are produced by _blocking_\r\nor by _closing up_; and stoppages are caused by a clot or dense\r\nmatter or a calculus or chalkstone or some growth that has formed in\r\nthe actual passage, as is also observed to occur in other, external,\r\norgans, the ears, the nostrils, genitals, or fundament; but closure\r\nis due either to a tumour following on phlegmonous affections or by\r\nindurations or other swellings which dilate the neck of the bladder\r\nand discharge the tumour into the internal passage). Comp. _Caelius\r\nAurelianus_ bk. V. ch. 4.\r\n\r\n[335] _Galen_, De loc. affect. bk. I. ch. 1.

(Accordingly if we suspect some accretion of\r\ntissue, the result of ulceration, to be blocking the neck of the\r\nbladder, our diagnosis will depend both on the foregoing signs of\r\nthe existence of an ulcer and also on the fact of the urine being\r\nvoided on the introduction of a _catheter_. Sometimes moreover I have\r\nnoted the following case to occur; on turning the catheter about pain\r\nwas experienced at the part of the canal where we had previously\r\nconjectured the ulceration to be situated, and the tissue being broken\r\ndown by the catheter, there followed after the evacuation of the urine\r\nsome blood and particles of tissue.... Whether in this case we ought to\r\ndescribe the mischief as something affecting the urethral canal, or say\r\nthat the cause is something lying in the same canal, is scientifically\r\nunimportant). For the catheter must always have the shape of the\r\npassage leading to the bladder (Method. med. bk. IV. ch. 7. X. p.\r\n301.); accordingly it must be bent into the shape of the letter\r\n“S” (Introduct. ch. 19. Vol. XIV. p. 788). The inventor of it was\r\nErasistratus (ibid. p. 751.). The employment of the catheter is well\r\ndescribed by _Paulus Aegineta_ bk. VI. ch. 59., who adds that different\r\ncatheters must be used according to age and sex.\r\n\r\n[336] _Oribasius_, Bk. L. ch. 8.

IV. ch. 7. (XIII. p. 725.), who gives it as\r\na φάρμακον (remedy) invented by Heraclides of Tarentum, but which is\r\nnot described in detail.

Now this sympathy between the different\r\norgans escapes many physicians; and sometimes they actually cut out\r\nthe spermatic cords as if these contained the special cause of the\r\nsuffering). In the edition due to Kühn’s industry the word κρεμαστῆρες\r\nis translated by _musculos cremasteres dictos_ (the muscles called\r\ncremasteres). The expression is also found in the “De sign. acut.” II.\r\n6., and _Petit_ in his Commentary on the first named passage declares\r\nin all seriousness that the sympathy was sufficiently well known to\r\nanatomists, arising from the connection of the cremasteres muscles with\r\nthe peritonaeum and its processes, which statement appears to rest on\r\nthe datum of _Galen_, De usu partium bk. XIV. ch. 11. (IV. p. 193.) and\r\nDe semine bk. II. ch. 5. (IV. p. 635.), where the cremasteres certainly\r\nare called μυώδη σώματα (muscular bodies) and compared with the round\r\nligaments of the womb. Still _Galen_ says distinctly in the latter\r\npassage that they contained arteries, veins and the spermatic ducts,\r\nin the Isagoge ch. 11. (XIV. p. 719.) ὃς (γόνος) φέρεται ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς\r\nδιὰ τῶν κρεμαστήρων (it,—the seed,—is conveyed to them through the\r\ncremasteres). On the other hand in the “De musc. sect.” Vol. XVIII.\r\nB. p. 997., the musculi cremasteres properly so called are clearly\r\ndescribed, and the statement added: Τὸ δὲ ἔργον αὐτῶν ἀνατείνειν\r\nτὸν ὄρχιν· ὅθεν ἔνιοι κρεμαστῆρας αὐτοὺς ὀνομάζουσι (but their duty\r\nis to hold up the testicles, for which reason some name them the\r\ncremasteres,—suspenders). Neither Blancard-Kühn nor yet Kraus’s Lexicon\r\ngive under the word “Cremaster” any meaning but that of the muscles;\r\nthe same is true of Schneider. Comp. _Paulus Aegineta_ bk. VI. ch. 61.,\r\nwhere the spermatic cords are also called παραστάται (supporters), as\r\nalso by Galen, Defin. med. XIX. p. 362. and De semine bk. I. Vol. IV.\r\np. 565., where they are spoken of as κιρσοειδῆς παραστάται (varicose\r\nparastatae). A denomination Herophilus first made use of (Galen IV. p.\r\n582.) and which according to _Athenaeus_ Deipnos. bk. IX. p. 396. was\r\nlikewise given to the testicles.\r\n\r\n[345] _Hippocrates_, Epidem. bk. V., edit. Kühn Vol. III. p. 548.\r\nBesides Hippocrates mentions almost exclusively the sympathetic\r\nswellings of the testicles that occur in cases of interruptions of\r\nthe respiration, particularly in coughs. Sextus Placitus Papyriensis\r\nlikewise, ch. 92. 4., ch. 101. 2., speaks of prurigo veretri (itching\r\nof the privates).\r\n\r\n[346] _Galen_, De semine ch. 15.

Both authors also make mention in\r\nthis connection of _sarcosis testium_ (swelling of the flesh of the\r\ntesticles). _Rambach_, Thesaurus Eroticus, a work which now for the\r\nfirst time is within our reach to consult, quotes under _ova_ pro\r\ncoleis (ova,—eggs, put for testicles):\r\n\r\n            Vel tantus ad ora veniret\r\n    Aut aliis causis ita computresceret ovum,\r\n    Ne fieri posset quin crudelis medicina\r\n    Ova recidisset, medici reprobabilis usus.\r\n\r\n(In fact such foulness appeared, or from other causes the testicle was\r\nso rotten, that nought could be done but for cruel surgery to cut out\r\nthe testicles,—the horrid habit of doctors), and assigns to it the name\r\n_Ovidius Pseud._ Is this perhaps a specimen of those old lines properly\r\nto be ascribed to some mediaeval monk?\r\n\r\n[348] _Galen_, Method. med. bk. V. ch. 4.

(And in this respect with regard\r\nto the privates and fundament we constantly come back to the same\r\nconditions of causation, viz. that these parts are readily affected\r\nby putrefaction, as well owing to their natural moistness as because\r\nthey are channels for excretions).

In Diocletian’s time\r\nwhen persecutions of the Christians were general, a fair and modest\r\nmaiden was charged with having spoken disrespectfully of the gods;\r\nfor punishment she was sent to a brothel with the order that she must\r\nreimburse the brothel-keeper three shillings a day. The latter was\r\nto make her serve as a prostitute, and she was to receive all who\r\nwished to go with her. Account however was taken of the fact that she\r\ndeclared _she had an ulcer on her privates_, and this obliged them to\r\nwait till it was cured (προσφασιζομένη ἕλκος ἔχειν ἐπὶ κρυπτοῦ τόπου\r\nκαὶ τούτου ἀπαλλαγὴν ἐκδέξασθαι) (pretexting she had an ulcer in a\r\nsecret place, and must wait for its removal). The same story is told by\r\n_Palladius_, Hist. lausiac. ch. 148., as having happened at Corinth,\r\nwho calls the ulcer an evil-smelling one, that might easily stir the\r\nrepugnance of her visitors against the girl, (λέγουσα, ὅτι ἕλκος ἔχω\r\nτι εἰς κεκρυμμένον τόπον, ὅπερ ἐσχάτως ὄζει, καὶ δέδοικα μὴ εἰς μῖσός\r\nμου ἔηθητε τῷ ἀποτροπαίῳ τοῦ ἕλκους· ἔνδοτε οὖν μοι ὀλίγας ἡμέρας καὶ\r\nἐξουσίαν μου ἔχετε καὶ δωρεάν με ἔχειν,)—(saying “I have an ulcer in\r\na secret part, which smells very ill, and I fear you may come to feel\r\nrepugnance towards me owing to the foulness of the ulcer; grant me\r\ntherefore a few days, then may work your will of me and I undertake to\r\ngive myself freely”). The last sentence shows clearly that the ulcer\r\nwas easy to cure. Comp. Nicephorus, Hist. eccles. bk. VII. chs. 12, 13.\r\n\r\n[400] _Aëtius_, Tetrab. IV. serm.

The remark of _Galen_,\r\nIsagog. ch. 20. (XIV. p. 792.), is interesting that _falling way of\r\nthe nose_ from the palate gives sufferers an apelike look, ἀλλὰ κἂν\r\nἐξ ὑπερώας μεσίζῃ ἡ ῥὶς, ὥς φησι, σιμοῦνται ἀθεραπεύτως,—(but if the\r\nnose separates from the palate, they get flat-nosed, as they say,\r\nlike monkeys,—incurable.) A special _nasal syringe_, rhynenchytes, is\r\nmentioned by _Caelius Aurelianus_, Chron. bk. I. ch. 4., bk. III. ch.\r\n2. Comp. _Calmasius_, Ad Solin p. 274.\r\n\r\n[436] _Johannes Moschus_, Pratum spirituale (Meadow of the Soul) ch.\r\n14. in Magna Bibliotheca veterum Patrum (Great Library of the Ancient\r\nFathers) Vol. XIII. Paris 1644. fol., p. 1062. Ὁ Ἀββᾶς Πολυχρόνιος\r\nπάλιν ἡμῖν διηγήσατο, ἡμῖν λέγων, ὅτι ἐν τῷ κοινοβίω τοῦ Πενθουκλὰ,\r\nἀδελφὸς ἦν πάνυ προσέχων αὑτὸν καὶ ἀσκητής· ἐπολεμήθη δὲ εἰς πορνείαν,\r\nκαὶ μὴ εἰσενεγκὼν τὸν πολέμον, ἐξῆλθεν τοῦ μοναστηρίου καὶ ἀπῆλθεν εἰς\r\nἸεριχὼ πληρῶσαι τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν αὐτοῦ· _καὶ ὡς εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ καταγώγιον\r\nτῆς πορνείας, εὐθέως ἐλεπρούθη ὅλως_· καὶ θεασάμενος ἑαυτὸν ἐν τοιούτῳ\r\nσχήματι, εὐθέως ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὸ μοναστήριον αὐτοῦ, εὐχαριστῶν τῷ\r\nθεῷ καὶ λέγων, ὅτι ὁ  θεὸς ἐπήγαμέν μοι τὴν τοιαύτην νόσον, ἵνα ἡ ψυχή\r\nμου σωθῇ. (The Abbot Polychronius again related an incident to us,\r\ntelling us how in the Monastery of Penthula there was a brother well\r\nself-disciplined and ascetic. But he was sorely tempted to fornication,\r\nand unable to fight the temptation, he went forth from the Monastery\r\nand departed to Jericho to fulfil his desire; and when he _entered into\r\nthe common house of fornication, straightway he became leprous all\r\nover_. And when he saw himself in such a case, straightway he returned\r\nto his Monastery, blessing God and saying, “God hath brought down this\r\ndisease upon me, that my soul might be saved”).\r\n\r\n[437] _Galen_, De locis affect. bk. II. ch. 8. (VIII. pp. 91, 104.).\r\nτοὺς δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν περὶ τὰ ὀστέα προστυπεῖς εὑρήσεις, ὡς αὐτῶν δοκεῖν τῶν\r\nὀστέων ὄντας· ... ὅτι δ’ οἱ τῶν περικειμένων τοῖς ὀστοῖς ὑμένων πόνοι\r\nβύθιοί τ’ εἰσὶν, τοῦτ’ ἔστι διὰ βάθους τοῦ σώματος ἐπιφέροντες αἴσθησιν,\r\nαὐτῶν τε τῶν ὀστῶν ἐπάγουσιν φαντασίαν ὡς ὀδυνωμένων, οὐδὲν θαυμαστόν·\r\nὀνομάζουσι γοῦν αὐτοὺς _ὀστοκόπους_ οἱ πλεῖστοι, γίνονται τὰ πολλὰ\r\nμὲν ἐπὶ γυμνασίοις, ἔστιν ὅτι δὲ καὶ διὰ ψύξιν, ἢ πλῆθος. (Now you will\r\nfind patients suffering from pains in the parts surrounding the bones\r\ninclined to suppose they are suffering from the bones themselves....\r\nAnd it is not at all surprising that pains in the membranes that lie\r\nabout the bones being deep-seated, that is giving a sensation of\r\nbeing deep-seated in the body, make patients imagine it is the bones\r\nthemselves that suffer. In fact they call them generally bone-racking\r\npains; and they are set up as a rule after bodily exercises, but also\r\nsometimes as a consequence of cold or heat).\r\n\r\n[438] _Natalis Comes_, Mythologia bk. III. p. 383., Deinde dicta\r\n(Cyprus) _Cerastia_, ut inquit Xenagoras in libro secundo de insulis,\r\nquod illam homines habitarent, _qui multos tumores, tanquam cornua\r\nquaedam in capitibus habere_ viderentur, cum cornua κέρατα dicta\r\nsint a Graecis et κεράσται cornuti. (Then it (Cyprus) was also named\r\n_Cerastia_, as Xenagoras says in his second Book “On Islands”, because\r\nits inhabitants _often had protuberances that looked like horns on\r\ntheir heads_, for horns are called κέρατα in Greek, and those having\r\nhorns κεράσται. Comp. _Stephanus_, De urbibus, under word Κύπρος, and\r\nΣφήκεια. _Tzetzes_, in Lycophron. Cassandr. 474. p. 173., ἐκαλεῖτο\r\nδὲ καὶ Κεραστία, ὡς μὲν Ἀνδροκλῆς ἐν τῷ περὶ Κύπρου λέγει, διὰ τὸ\r\n_ἐνοικῆσαι αὐτῇ ἄνδρας, οἳ εἶχον κέρατα_· ὡς δὲ Ξεναγόρας ἐν τῷ περὶ\r\nΝήσων, διὰ _τὸ ἔχειν πολλὰς ἐξοχὰς_, ἃς κέρατα καλοῦσι, Κεραστία\r\nὠνομάσθη. (And it was also called Κεραστία, according to Androcles\r\nin his Book “On Cyprus”, _because men lived in it who had horns_;\r\nbut according to Xenagoras in his “On Islands”, because they had\r\nmany protuberances, which they call horns, for this reason it was\r\nnamed Κεραστία). Even supposing the etymology to be a fable, is\r\nthe fact therefore on which it was based bound to be mythical too?\r\nAgain _Pollux_, Onomast. bk. IV. ch. 25., says, Κέρατα, ἐν τῷ τόπῳ\r\nτῶν κεράτων περὶ τὸ μέτωπου _πωρώδεις ἐκφύσης_, (horns,—_a sort of\r\ncallous outgrowths_ at the place where horns grow on the forehead).\r\nThe words succeeding περὶ τὸ δέρμα (on the skin) are no doubt more\r\nappropriately taken with ἕρπης (creeping eruption) that comes next\r\nafter them. In _Sextus Placitus Papyriensis_, ch. XI. 5. we read:\r\nElephantis stercus illitum omnes tumores emendat, et _duritias, quae in\r\nfronte nascuntur_, mire tollit, (Elephant’s dung rubbed on cures all\r\nswellings, and removes in a wonderful way the _callosities that grow on\r\nthe forehead_), but this really and truly can only be held applicable\r\nto cutaneous tubercles.)",
