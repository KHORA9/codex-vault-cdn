It consists\r\nof two distinct branches: that treating of medical law, to which\r\nthe designation of MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE properly applies; and that\r\nrelating to the application of medical, surgical, or obstetrical\r\nknowledge to the purposes of legal trials, FORENSIC MEDICINE.[1]\r\n\r\nThe term STATE MEDICINE, which is sometimes erroneously used as\r\nsynonymous with forensic medicine, properly applies to a more extended\r\nfield of medical inquiry; _i.e._, to all applications of medical\r\nknowledge to the public welfare. State medicine, therefore, while\r\nexcluding medical jurisprudence, includes, besides forensic medicine,\r\npublic hygiene, medical ethics, medical education, and military and\r\nnaval medicine.\r\n\r\nTOXICOLOGY, the science of poisons, may be divided into _medical\r\ntoxicology_, whose object is the prevention or cure of all forms of\r\npoisoning, and _forensic toxicology_, whose aim is the detection of\r\ncriminal poisoning. In its last-named relation toxicology differs from\r\nforensic medicine in one important particular. In all cases other than\r\nthose of poisoning in which questions involving medical knowledge\r\narise, the answers are entirely within the functions of the physician,\r\nthe surgeon, or the obstetrician, but the problems of forensic\r\ntoxicology require for their solution the further aid of the chemist\r\nand the pharmacologist.\r\n\r\nForensic medicine is an applied science, partly legal, partly medical,\r\ncalling for information and investigation in widely divergent lines,\r\nand becoming more minutely ramified with the progressive advances in\r\nmedical knowledge and in those sciences of which medicine is itself\r\nan application. Its development has been dependent partly upon the\r\nslow though progressive tendency of medicine from the condition of an\r\nempirical art toward that of an exact science, and partly upon the\r\nmore rapid and more advanced development of criminal jurisprudence.\r\nMedical jurisprudence had reached a high development during the early\r\nhistory of the Roman Empire, and at a period long anterior to the first\r\nrecognition of forensic medicine.\r\n\r\nAlthough the literature of modern medico-legal science is very\r\nlargely written from the medical point of view and by physicians, its\r\nearlier history is to be found in fragmentary form, partly in medical\r\nliterature, but principally in the writings of historians, in the\r\nearlier criminal codes, and in the early records of legal proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest historical periods the functions now exercised by\r\nthe priest, the lawyer, and the physician were performed by the\r\nsame person, who, presumably, made use of what medical knowledge he\r\npossessed in the exercise of his legal functions. Among the Egyptians\r\nat a very early period it is certain that medical questions of fact\r\nwere considered in legal proceedings, and that the practice of medicine\r\nwas subject to legal regulation. According to Diodorus,[2] “when a\r\npregnant woman was condemned to death, the sentence was not executed\r\nuntil after she was delivered.” The same author tells us[3] that “the\r\nphysicians regulated the treatment of the sick according to written\r\nprecepts, collected and transmitted by the most celebrated of their\r\npredecessors. If, in following exactly these precepts which are\r\ncontained in the sacred books, they did not succeed in curing the sick,\r\nthey could not be reproached, nor could they be prosecuted at law; but\r\nif they have proceeded contrary to the text of the books, they are\r\ntried, and may be condemned to death, the legislator supposing that but\r\nfew persons will ever be found capable of improving a curative method\r\npreserved during so long a succession of years and adopted by the most\r\nexpert masters of the art.” With the system of legal trial in use among\r\nthe Egyptians[4] it is difficult to imagine that the question of the\r\nexistence of pregnancy in the one case, or of malpractice in the other,\r\nwould not be the subject of contest, and, if contested, determined\r\nwithout the testimony of obstetricians or of physicians.[5]\r\n\r\nMedical knowledge among the Hindoos was further advanced than among\r\nthe Egyptians. In the Rig Veda (about 1500 B.C.) occur a few medical\r\nreferences, among which is the statement that the duration of pregnancy\r\nis ten (lunar) months.\r\n\r\nThe earliest purely medical Sanskrit texts are the Ayur Vedas of\r\nChâraka and Sûsruta, which were probably written about 600 B.C., but\r\nwhich are undoubtedly compilations of information which had been handed\r\ndown during many centuries before that time. In each of these is a\r\nsection devoted to poisons and their antidotes (Kalpa), in which it is\r\nwritten that a knowledge of poisons and antidotes is necessary to the\r\nphysician “because the enemies of the Rajah, bad women, and ungrateful\r\nservants sometimes mix poison with the food.” Full directions are\r\nalso given for the recognition of a person who gives poison, and to\r\ndifferentiate the poisons themselves, whose number, from all the\r\nkingdoms of nature, is legion. The age at which women may marry is\r\nfixed at twelve years, while men may not marry before twenty-five. The\r\nduration of pregnancy is given as between nine and twelve lunar months,\r\nthe average being ten. The practice of medicine is restricted to\r\ncertain castes, and requires the sanction of the Rajah, and the method\r\nof education of medical students is prescribed.[6]\r\n\r\nIt is singular that the Greeks were apparently destitute of any\r\nknowledge of legal medicine. Although medicine and jurisprudence were\r\nhighly developed among them, allusions to any connection between the\r\ntwo are of very rare occurrence and uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe Hippocratic writings (_ca._ 420 B.C.) contain many facts which\r\nare of medico-legal interest: the possibility of superfœtation was\r\nrecognized;[7] the average duration of pregnancy was known, and\r\nthe viability of children born before term was discussed,[8] the\r\nrelative fatality of wounds affecting different parts of the body was\r\nconsidered,[9] and the Hippocratic oath makes the physician swear that\r\nhe “will not administer or advise the use of poison, nor contribute to\r\nan abortion.” The position of the physician in Greek communities was an\r\nexalted one. No slave or woman might be taught medicine,[10] although\r\nlater free-born women were permitted to practise in their native\r\nplaces. Homer also refers to physicians as men of learning and of\r\ndistinction.[11] The Greek physician was therefore in a position, both\r\nfrom his information and from his standing in the community, to aid in\r\nthe administration of justice.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were also extremely litigious and possessed a code of\r\ncriminal procedure which was elaborate, and in many respects resembled\r\nthose now in use in England and the United States.[12] The writings of\r\nthe Greek orators, Demosthenes, Æschines, Lysias, Antiphon, Isocrates,\r\netc., which have come down to us substantiate the claim of Ælian\r\nthat “to Athens mankind is indebted for the olive, the fig, and the\r\nadministration of justice.”[13]\r\n\r\nThe writings of the Greek physicians contain no reference to any legal\r\napplication of their knowledge, and certain passages in the writings\r\nof the orators seem to indicate that, while a physician was called to\r\ninspect and treat a wounded person, the testimony as to the patient’s\r\ncondition was given in court by others.\r\n\r\nThus in the case against Euergos and Mnesibulus, in which an old woman\r\nhad died some days after an assault, Demosthenes[14] states that he\r\nnotified the accused to bring a surgeon and cure the woman; but that\r\nas they did not do so, he himself brought his own surgeon and showed\r\nhim her condition in the presence of witnesses. Upon hearing from the\r\nsurgeon that the woman was in a hopeless condition, he again explained\r\nher state to the accused and required them to find medical aid.\r\nFinally, on the sixth day after the assault the woman died. He further\r\nasserts that these statements would be proved by the depositions.[15]\r\n\r\nThe third Tetralogy of Antiphon[16] (B.C. 480) relates to a case in\r\nwhich the defence was essentially the same as that which was the\r\nsubject of a vast amount of medical expert testimony in a celebrated\r\ntrial for murder in New York not many years ago. A person wounds\r\nanother, who dies some days afterward. The assailant is accused of\r\nmurder and sets up the defence that the deceased perished, not from\r\nthe wounds inflicted, but in consequence of unskilful treatment by the\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\nIn neither of these cases is any mention made of physicians having been\r\ncalled upon for testimony; indeed, the statements would lead to the\r\ninference that they were not. In another case in which a poor and sick\r\ncitizen is accused of malingering to obtain the customary pecuniary\r\naid from the State, Lysias[17] summons no medical evidence but relies\r\nentirely upon a statement of his client’s case.[18]\r\n\r\nMedical legislation was not more advanced during the ascendancy of\r\nthe Roman Empire, although medical science was greatly developed,\r\nprincipally by the labors of Celsus, and of Galen and other Greek\r\nphysicians. A few cases are mentioned by the historians which would\r\nseem to indicate a closer connection between law and medicine than\r\nhad existed among the Greeks, but they refer rather to the custom of\r\nexposing the bodies of those who had died by violent means to public\r\nview, in order that any one might express his opinion as to the cause\r\nof death, than to any appeal to medical science in the administration\r\nof justice. Thus Suetonius[19] says that the physician Antistius\r\nexamined the dead body of Julius Cæsar (B.C. 44), and declared that of\r\nall the wounds only that received in the breast was mortal.\r\n\r\nPliny[20] cites an early instance of contested interpretation of\r\npost-mortem appearances in the case of Germanicus, who died A.D.\r\n19, by the action of poison, said the enemies of Piso, because the\r\nheart did not burn. The friends of Piso, while admitting the fact\r\nof non-consumption, attributed it to the deceased having had heart\r\ndisease. The same author[21] quotes Masurius as having declared a child\r\nborn after thirteen (lunar) months to be legitimate, in an action for\r\nthe possession of property, on the ground that no certain period of\r\ngestation was fixed. The Emperor Hadrian (A.D. 117-138), according to\r\nGellius, sought medical information in a similar case, and decreed the\r\nlegitimacy of a child born in the eleventh (lunar) month, “after having\r\nconsidered the opinions of ancient philosophers and physicians.”[22]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Justinian collections, the “Codex” (A.D. 529), the\r\n“Institutes” (A.D. 533), the “Digests,” or “Pandects” (A.D. 534),\r\nand the “Novels” (A.D. 535-564), prepared by the best legal talent\r\nof the age, under the direction of Tribonian, do not provide for the\r\nsummoning of physicians as witnesses; they contain an expression which\r\nindicates that at that time the true function of the medical expert\r\nwas more correctly appreciated than it is to-day. His function was\r\nstated to be judicial rather than that of a witness.[23] There is\r\nalso a provision that in cases of contested pregnancy, midwives (who\r\nwere considered as belonging to the medical profession) should, after\r\nexamination of the woman, determine whether or no pregnancy exist, and\r\nthat their determination should be final. The practice of medicine,\r\nsurgery, and midwifery was regulated. Those desiring to practise must\r\nhave been found competent by an examination. The number of physicians\r\nin each town was limited. They were divided into classes, and were\r\nsubject to the government of the Archiatri. Penalties were imposed upon\r\nthose guilty of malpractice or of poisoning. The Justinian enactments\r\ncontain abundant internal evidence of having been framed in the light\r\nof medical knowledge. They contain provisions relating to sterility\r\nand impotence, rape, disputed pregnancy, legitimacy, diseased mental\r\nconditions, presumption of survivorship, poisoning, etc., which\r\nindicate that the medical knowledge of the time was fully utilized in\r\ntheir construction.[24]\r\n\r\nThe Germanic peoples at about the same period possessed codes in\r\nwhich traces of a rudimentary medical jurisprudence existed. The most\r\nancient of these was the Salic law (A.D. 422), in which the penalties\r\nto be paid for wounds of different kinds are fixed. The Ripuarian law,\r\nof somewhat later date, takes cognizance of the crime of poisoning.\r\nThe laws of the Bavarians, Burgundians, Frisians, Thuringians, and\r\nVisigoths contain practically nothing of medico-legal interest. The Lex\r\nAlamannorum has numerous provisions relating to wounds, and expressly\r\nprovides that the gravity of the injury shall be determined by a\r\nphysician.[25]\r\n\r\nDuring the period of about a thousand years, intervening between\r\nthe Justinian and Caroline (_vide infra_) codes, the advancement of\r\nmedicine and jurisprudence suffered almost complete arrest. The guilt\r\nor innocence of an accused person was determined rather by his own\r\nconfession under torture, or by “the judgment of God” as shown by\r\nordeal or by judicial combat, than by testimony either expert or of\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nEven during the night of the Middle Ages, instances are recorded in\r\nwhich the opinions of physicians were sought to determine questions of\r\nfact in judicial proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn the duchy of Normandy, in 1207-45, the laws provided for the\r\nexamination of those claiming to be sick (to evade military service or\r\nappeal to judicial duel), of persons killed, and of women.[26]\r\n\r\nIn a decretal of Innocent III., in 1209, the question whether a certain\r\nwound was mortal was determined by physicians.[27]\r\n\r\nThere is extant in the statutes of the city of Bologna, under date of\r\n1249, an entry to the effect that Hugo di Lucca had been assigned the\r\nduty, when called upon by the podesta, and after having been sworn, to\r\nfurnish a true report in legal cases.[28]\r\n\r\nIn the kingdom of Jerusalem (_ca._ 1250) a person claiming exemption\r\nfrom trial by battle because of sickness or of wounds was visited by\r\na physician (_fisicien au miége_) and a surgeon (_sérorgien_), who\r\nexamined him and made oath as to his condition.[29]\r\n\r\nSworn surgeons to the king are also mentioned in letters patent of\r\nPhilippe le Hardi in 1278, of Philippe le Bel in 1311, and of Jean II.\r\nin 1352.[30] That of Philippe le Bel refers to Jean Pitardi as one of\r\n“his well-beloved sworn surgeons in his Chastelet of Paris,” whose\r\nfunctions are partly indicated by the extracts from the registers given\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe registers of the Châtelet at Paris from 1389 to 1392 record several\r\ninstances in which medical aid was rendered in judicial proceedings.\r\nUnder date of March 22d, 1389-90, “Maître Jehan Le Conte, sworn surgeon\r\nto the king our sire,” reports to Maître Jehan Truquam, lieutenant to\r\nthe provost, that “upon that day in the morning one Rotisseur had gone\r\nfrom life unto death in consequence of the wounds which he had received\r\non the Monday evening preceding.”[31] Under date of July 22d, 1390,\r\nis an account of the examination of one Jehan le Porchier, accused of\r\nintent to poison the king (Charles VI.), in which there is reference\r\nto a very early instance of toxicological expert evidence. In the\r\nwallet of the accused certain herbs were found. The account proceeds:\r\n“Richart de Bules, herbalist, was summoned, to him the above-mentioned\r\nherbs were shown, and he was commanded that he should examine them and\r\nconsider well and duly, reporting the truth of what he should find.\r\nThe said Richart, after having examined them with great diligence,\r\nreported that in the box in which these herbs were he had found six\r\nleaves, namely: one leaf of _jacia nigra_, and one of round plantain,\r\ncalled in Latin _plantago minor_, and four of sow-thistle (_lasseron_),\r\ncalled in Latin _rosti poterugni_, and says that the leaf of _jatria\r\nnigra_ is poisonous, but that in the others there is no poison known\r\nto the deponent.”[32] On August 12th, 1390, “Jehan Le Conte and Jehan\r\nLe Grant, sworn surgeons of our sire the king,” are present at the\r\ntorture of a prisoner, but for what purpose does not appear. In another\r\ncase the same Jehan Le Conte testified that a wound in the head of a\r\ndeceased person was made with an axe.[33] At a later period in Italy,\r\nthe infliction of “the question” took place under medical supervision.\r\nZacchias devotes a chapter, _De Tormentis et Pœnis_,[34] to the\r\nconsideration of the different methods of torture, the degrees of pain\r\nand danger attending each, and the conditions of age, sex, and health\r\nwhich render its application inadmissible.[35]\r\n\r\nDuring this period, as indeed from the earliest times, the practice\r\nof medicine was regulated by law. Thus a law of King Roger of Sicily\r\n(1129-54) punished those who practised medicine without authority with\r\nimprisonment and confiscation of goods; and an edict of Frederick II.\r\n(1215-46) imposed like penalties upon those who presumed to practise\r\nexcept after graduation at the school of Salernum.[36]\r\n\r\nMedico-legal science was formed in the middle of the sixteenth century\r\nby a simultaneous awakening of jurists and physicians to the importance\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\nIt was in Germany that expert medical testimony was first legally\r\nrecognized. In 1507, George, Bishop of Bamberg, proclaimed a criminal\r\ncode in his domains. This was subsequently adopted by other German\r\nstates, and finally was the model upon which the _Caroline Code_, the\r\nfirst general criminal code applying to the whole empire, was framed\r\nand proclaimed at the Diet of Ratisbon in 1532.[37]\r\n\r\nThese codes, particularly the Caroline, distinctly provide for\r\nutilizing the testimony of physicians. Wounds are to be examined by\r\nsurgeons who are “to be used as witnesses;”[38] and in case of death\r\none or more surgeons are to “examine the dead body carefully before\r\nburial.”[39] They also contain provisions for the examination of women\r\nin cases of contested delivery, or suspected infanticide;[40] for the\r\nregulation of the sale of poisons;[41] for the detection and punishment\r\nof malpractice;[42] and for examination into the mental condition in\r\ncases of suicide and of crime.[43]\r\n\r\nAn early work on the practice of criminal law, based on the Caroline\r\nCode, was published by the Flemish jurist, Josse de Damhouder, in 1554.\r\nIt contains a chapter treating of the lethality of wounds, which should\r\nbe determined by expert physicians and surgeons,[44] and describes\r\nthe course which is to be pursued in the judicial examination of dead\r\nbodies. This is probably the earliest printed book (other than the laws\r\nthemselves) containing reference to medico-legal examinations,[45] and\r\nantedates the writings of physicians upon the subject.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was only in 1670 that the Ordinances of Louis XIV. gave\r\nto France a uniform criminal code, medico-legal reports were made by\r\nphysicians and surgeons to the courts more than a century before.\r\nIndeed, the earliest medico-legal work written by a physician[46] is\r\nthe 27th book of the Œuvres d’Ambroise Paré, first printed in 1575,\r\nin which he directs the forms in which judicial reports shall be\r\nmade in various medico-legal cases.[47] During the remainder of the\r\nsixteenth century France produced but three treatises on medico-legal\r\nsubjects.[48] One of these, written by the jurist A. Hotman, distinctly\r\nmentions the employment of physicians to determine questions of fact.\r\n\r\nIn Italy works on medical jurisprudence were published at the close of\r\nthe sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century. The earliest\r\nof these was a chapter of Codronchius, treating of the “method of\r\ntestifying in medical cases,” in 1597.[49] At about the same time, but\r\ncertainly later, appeared the work of Fortunatus Fidelis, to whom the\r\nhonor of being the first writer on medical jurisprudence is given by\r\nmany.[50]\r\n\r\nThe great work of Paulus Zacchias, physician to Pope Innocent X., was\r\nfirst printed at Rome, 1621-35. This medico-legal classic contains\r\nin the first two volumes the “_Quæstiones_” and in the third the\r\ndecisions of the Roman Rota. It treats of every branch of medico-legal\r\nscience, and discusses physiological questions of legal interest,\r\nbesides dealing with questions such as the infliction of torture and\r\nmiracles.[51]\r\n\r\nAlthough the “Quæstiones Medico-legales” of Zacchias was the first\r\nsystematic work upon medical jurisprudence, his countrymen in\r\nsucceeding centuries have contributed but little to this science. It is\r\nonly during the latter part of the present century that Italians have\r\nagain become prominent in medico-legal literature.\r\n\r\nIn France legal medicine progressed but little from the time of Paré to\r\nthe latter part of the eighteenth century. Several treatises appeared,\r\nbeing chiefly upon legitimacy and kindred subjects,[52] with a few\r\ntreating of reports, signs of death, etc.[53]\r\n\r\nToward the end of the eighteenth century the labors of Louis, Petit,\r\nChaussier, and Fodéré elevated legal medicine to the rank of a science.\r\nThe investigations of Louis (Ant. L.) were numerous and important in\r\nthis as in other subjects,[54] and the “_causes célébres_” contain\r\nreports of many trials in which he threw light upon doubtful medical\r\nquestions.[55] Antoine Petit, a contemporary of Louis, contributed an\r\nextensive work on the duration of pregnancy as affecting legitimacy.[56]\r\n\r\nSomewhat later Fr. B. Chaussier, between 1785 and 1828, published\r\nat Dijon a number of treatises on infanticide, viability, surgical\r\nmalpractice, etc.[57] Fodéré, a Savoyard, was the first to publish a\r\nsystematic treatise on medical jurisprudence in France, which was first\r\nprinted in 1798 and in a much enlarged form in 1813.[58] This last\r\nedition is an exhaustive treatise upon all branches of legal medicine\r\nand public hygiene, and won for its author the appointment as Professor\r\nof Forensic Medicine in the University of Strassburg.\r\n\r\nAt about the same period appeared the works of Mahon[59] and of\r\nBelloc,[60] both of which went through three editions in ten years, and\r\nthose of Biessy.[61]\r\n\r\nThe most industrious and original of French professors of legal\r\nmedicine was Orfila. A native of Minorca, he graduated in medicine\r\nat Paris in 1811, and devoting himself to chemical and toxicological\r\ninvestigations, published the first edition of his “Traité des\r\nPoisons” in 1814. This work, which may be regarded as the foundation\r\nof experimental and forensic toxicology, went through five editions\r\nto 1852, and was translated into several foreign languages. The first\r\nedition of his “Leçons de Médecine légale” appeared in 1821, and the\r\nfourth in 1848. Besides these Orfila published a work on the treatment\r\nof asphyxia and a great number of papers on medico-legal subjects,\r\nprincipally in the _Annales d’Hygiène_, of which he was one of the\r\nfounders with Andral, Esquirol, Leuret, and Devergie. Orfila occupied\r\nthe chair of chemistry and medical jurisprudence in the University\r\nof Paris for upward of thirty years, and was employed as expert in\r\ninnumerable cases before the courts.\r\n\r\nContemporaneous with Orfila, and almost as prominent, was Devergie, the\r\nfirst edition of whose “Médecine légale,” in three volumes, appeared in\r\n1836, and the third in 1852.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 the first edition of the Manual of Briand and Brosson was\r\npublished. This work, the tenth edition of which was published in 1879,\r\nis the first in which a jurist was associated with a physician in the\r\nauthorship,[62] and is one of five of which one of the authors is a\r\nlawyer.[63]\r\n\r\nSpecial treatises on the medico-legal relations of insanity were\r\npublished by Georget (1821), Falvet (1828), Esquirol (1838), and Marc\r\n(1840), and on midwifery by Capuron (1821).\r\n\r\nTardieu, Professor of Legal Medicine in the University of Paris\r\n(1861-79), published a most important series of monographs on hygienic\r\nand medico-legal subjects,[64] besides many papers, principally in the\r\n_Annales d’Hygiène_, _etc._, and testified before the courts in many\r\n“_causes célébres_.”\r\n\r\nThe first work of medico-legal interest to appear in Germany was the\r\n“Medicus-Politicus” of Rodericus à Castro, a Portuguese Jew living in\r\nHamburg, printed in 1614, which deals principally with medical ethics\r\nand the relations of physicians, but contains chapters on simulated\r\ndiseases, poisoning, wounds, drowning, and virginity.[65]\r\n\r\nIt was only toward the end of the seventeenth century that the\r\nsubject was scientifically treated, and during the latter part of\r\nthe seventeenth century and the beginning of the eighteenth great\r\nprogress was made in the development of forensic medicine in Germany.\r\nJohannes Bohn, one of the originators of the experimental method of\r\ninvestigation in physiological chemistry and physics, at the University\r\nof Leipzig, was also one of the earliest German contributors to the\r\nliterature of legal medicine. Besides smaller works he published two\r\nnoteworthy treatises: in 1689 a work on the examination of wounds\r\nand the distinction between ante-mortem and post-mortem wounds, and\r\nbetween death by injury, strangulation, and drowning.[66] In 1704 a\r\nwork giving rules for the conduct of physicians in attending the sick\r\nand in giving evidence in the courts.[67] At about the same period M.\r\nB. Valentini, professor in the University of Giessen, published three\r\nimportant works, containing collections of medico-legal cases, and of\r\nthe opinions and decisions of previous writers.[68] Another extensive\r\ncollection of cases and decisions was published in 1706 by J. F.\r\nZittmann, from a MS. left by Professor C. J. Lange, of the University\r\nof Leipzig;[69] and still another by J. S. Hasenest[70] appeared in\r\n1755.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the eighteenth century, the Germans\r\ncultivated legal medicine assiduously, and a great number of works upon\r\nthe subject were published. Among these may be mentioned those of M.\r\nAlberti, professor at the University of Halle;[71] H. F. Teichmeyer,\r\nof the University of Jena;[72] A. O. Gölicke, of the universities of\r\nHalle and Duisburg, who was the first to prepare a bibliography of\r\nthe subject;[73] J. F. Fasel (Faselius), professor at Jena;[74] J. E.\r\nHebenstreit and C. S. Ludwig, professors at Leipzig;[75] C. F. Daniel,\r\nof Halle;[76] J. D. Metzger, professor at Königsberg, the author of\r\na number of works, one of which, a compendium, was translated into\r\nseveral other languages;[77] J. V. Müller, of Frankfurt;[78] J. C. T.\r\nSchlegel, who collected a series of more than forty dissertations by\r\nvarious writers;[79] M. M. Sikora, of Prague;[80] J. J. von Plenck,\r\nprofessor in Vienna, who published a work on forensic medicine and\r\none on toxicology;[81] K. F. Uden, subsequently professor in St.\r\nPetersburg, who was the first to publish a periodical journal devoted\r\nto legal medicine, which was afterward continued by J. F. Pyl at\r\nStendal;[82] and J. C. Fahner.[83]\r\n\r\nAt this period compends for students were published in Germany, which\r\nindicate by their number the extent to which this science was the\r\nsubject of study. Among these those of Ludwig (1765), Kannegieser\r\n(1768), von Plenck (1781), Frenzel (1791), Loder (1791), Amemann\r\n(1793), Metzger (1800), and Roose may be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Germans of the present century have maintained the pre-eminence\r\nin legal medicine achieved by their forefathers. Among a great\r\nnumber of investigators and writers a few may be mentioned: C. F. L.\r\nWildberg, professor at Rostock, was a most prolific writer, edited\r\na journal devoted to state medicine, and contributed a valuable\r\nbibliography of the subject;[84] A. F. Hecker, professor at Erfurth\r\nand afterward at Berlin, and J. H. Kopp each edited and contributed\r\nextensively to a medico-legal journal.[85] A much more important\r\nperiodical was established in 1821 by Adolph Henke, professor in\r\nBerlin, and was continuously published until 1864. Henke also wrote\r\na great number of articles and a text-book on legal medicine.[86]\r\nJos. Bernt, professor at Vienna, published a collection of cases, a\r\nsystematic treatise, and a number of monographs,[87] as well as the\r\nMS. work left by his predecessor in the chair, F. B. Vietz. A handbook\r\ncontaining an excellent history of medico-legal science was published\r\nby L. J. C. Mende, professor at Griefswald,[88] who also contributed\r\na number of monographs, chiefly on obstetrical subjects. K. W. N.\r\nWagner contributed but little to the literature of the subject, but\r\nit was chiefly by his efforts, while professor in the University\r\nof Berlin, that a department for instruction in state medicine was\r\nestablished there in 1832. A. H. Nicolai, also professor at Berlin,\r\npublished a handbook[89] besides numerous articles in the journals.\r\nF. J. Siebenhaar published an encyclopædia of legal medicine, and\r\nin 1842 established a journal devoted to state medicine, which in\r\nits continuations was published until 1872.[90] J. B. Friedreich,\r\nprofessor at Erlangen, after editing a journal devoted to state\r\nmedicine from 1844 to 1849, established one of the most important of\r\ncurrent medico-legal periodicals in 1850,[91] to both of which he\r\nwas a frequent contributor until his death in 1862. Ludwig Choulant,\r\nprofessor at Dresden, and more widely known as the author of important\r\ncontributions to the history of medicine, published two series of\r\nreports of medico-legal investigations.[92]\r\n\r\nThe foremost forensic physician of this period in Germany was\r\nunquestionably John Ludwig Casper, professor in the University of\r\nBerlin and “forensic physician” (gerichtlicher Physicus) to that city,\r\nwho greatly extended the department established in the university\r\nunder Wagner. He made innumerable investigations, some of which are\r\npreserved in several collections of cases,[93] others in his classic\r\nHandbook,[94] and still others in the periodical which he established\r\nin 1852, and which is now the most important current medico-legal\r\njournal.[95]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary in this place to make mention of one work by living\r\nauthors, as its appearance marked a new departure in medico-legal\r\nliterature, and as in it the fact that forensic medicine extends over\r\nso wide a field of inquiry as to require treatment at the hands of\r\nspecialists was first recognized. To Josef von Maschka, professor in\r\nthe University of Prague, the credit is due of having been the first\r\nto produce, with the collaboration of twenty-two colleagues, a truly\r\nsystematic work on modern forensic medicine.[96]\r\n\r\nEnglish works upon this subject did not exist prior to the present\r\ncentury,[97] although physicians were employed by the courts to\r\ndetermine medical questions of fact at a much earlier date. Paris and\r\nFonblanque, in the third Appendix of their “Medical Jurisprudence,”\r\ngive the text of reports by the Colleges of Physicians of London and\r\nof Edinburgh concerning the cause of death as early as 1632 and 1687\r\nrespectively.[98]\r\n\r\nLectures on medical jurisprudence were given at the University of\r\nEdinburgh by A. Duncan, Sr., at least as early as 1792.[99] The title\r\nof Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in a British university was\r\nconferred for the first time, however, upon A. Duncan, Jr., at the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh in 1806.[100]\r\n\r\nThe first English work on medical jurisprudence worthy of consideration\r\nis the medical classic known as Percival’s “Medical Ethics.” This\r\nwas first published in 1803, and contains in its fourth chapter an\r\nadmirable epitome of legal medicine.[101] A more elaborate work, based\r\nvery largely, however, upon the writings of continental authors,\r\nwas published by G. E. Male in 1816.[102] In 1821 Professor John\r\nGordon Smith published the first systematic treatise on forensic\r\nmedicine,[103] and was one of the first in Great Britain to show the\r\nimportance of the subject.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1823, appeared the elaborate and scholarly work\r\nof Dr. Paris and Mr. Fonblanque, the first in the English language\r\nin whose authorship members of the medical and legal professions\r\nwere associated.[104] In 1831, Prof. Michael Ryan published the\r\nfirst edition of his “Manual of Medical Jurisprudence” from the\r\nmemoranda of his lectures on the subject in the Westminster School of\r\nMedicine.[105] A similar work was published by Professor T. S. Traill,\r\nof the University of Edinburgh, in 1836.[106] The awakened interest in\r\nmedico-legal subjects among the medical profession during the decade\r\n1830-40 is evidenced by the publication in the medical journals of\r\nthe lectures of A. Amos, in 1830-31; of A. T. Thomson, at the London\r\nUniversity, in 1834-35; of H. Graham, at Westminster Hospital, in\r\n1835; of W. Cummin, at the Aldersgate Street School, in 1836-37; and\r\nof T. Southwood Smith, at the Webb Street Theatre of Anatomy, in\r\n1837-38.[107]\r\n\r\nAmong the noteworthy contributions to the science previous to 1850\r\nare the writings of Dease (1808), Haslam (1817),[108] Christison, the\r\nsuccessor of Professor Duncan in the University of Edinburgh, and best\r\nknown as a toxicologist, Forsyth (1829),[109] Chitty (1834),[110]\r\nWatson (1837),[111] Brady (1839),[112] Skae (1840),[113] Pagan\r\n(1840),[114] and Sampson (1841).[115]\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Dr. Alfred Swaine Taylor (b. 1806, d. 1880), the first\r\nProfessor of Medical Jurisprudence in Guy’s Hospital, published his\r\n“Elements of Medical Jurisprudence.” This, the most important work upon\r\nthe subject in the English language, is now in its twelfth English\r\nand eleventh American edition. During forty years of devotion to\r\nforensic medicine Dr. Taylor also contributed other important works and\r\nnumerous papers, published for the most part in the Reports of Guy’s\r\nHospital.[116] In 1844, Dr. Wm. A. Guy, Professor of Forensic Medicine\r\nin King’s College, published the first edition of his excellent\r\nwork.[117] In 1858, Fr. Ogston, Professor of Medical Jurisprudence\r\nin the University of Aberdeen, published a syllabus and subsequently\r\n(1878) a complete report of his lectures.[118] In 1882, C. M. Tidy,\r\nProfessor of Chemistry and Forensic Medicine in the London Hospital,\r\nwho had previously (1877) been associated with W. B. Woodman in the\r\nauthorship of a valuable handbook, began the publication of a more\r\nextended work, which was interrupted by his death in 1892.[119]\r\n\r\nThe first Spanish work on legal medicine was that of Juan Fernandez\r\ndel Valles, printed in 1796-97.[120] No further contribution to\r\nmedico-legal literature was furnished by Spain until the appearance in\r\n1834 of the work of Peiro and Rodrigo, which went through four editions\r\nin ten years.[121] Ten years later, in 1844, Pedro Mata, Professor of\r\nLegal Medicine and Toxicology at Madrid, published the first edition of\r\na work, which in the development of its subsequent editions, has become\r\nthe most important on the subject in the Spanish language.[122]\r\n\r\nThe first Portuguese medico-legal treatise was that of Jose Ferreira\r\nBorjes, first printed at Paris in 1832.[123]\r\n\r\nA posthumously published report of the lectures of Albrecht von Haller\r\nwas the earliest Swiss work on forensic medicine.[124]\r\n\r\nIn Sweden the earliest medico-legal publication was a comprehensive\r\ntreatise by Jonas Kiernander, in 1776,[125] which was followed in 1783\r\nby a translation of Hebenstreit, by R. Martin. The voluminous writings\r\nof the brothers Wistrand (A. T. and A. H.), including a handbook,\r\nwere published at Stockholm, between 1836 and 1871. Between 1846 and\r\n1873, several articles upon medico-legal subjects were published at\r\nHelsingfors, in Finland, by E. J. Bonsdorff, O. E. Dahl, and J. A.\r\nEstlander. In 1838 Skielderup[126] published his lectures on legal\r\nmedicine, delivered at Christiania, and Orlamundt[127] published\r\na handbook at Copenhagen in 1843. The earliest recognition of\r\nmedico-legal science in Russia was in the lectures of Balk,[128] begun\r\nin 1802 at the then newly founded University of Dorpat.\r\n\r\nAlthough dissertations upon subjects of medico-legal interest were\r\npublished at the University of Leyden as early as the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century,[129] and the works of Pineau,[130] Zacchias,[131]\r\nLudwig,[132] von Plenk,[133] and Metzger[134] were printed in Holland,\r\neither in Latin or in the vernacular, no original systematic work on\r\nlegal medicine in the Dutch language has yet appeared.\r\n\r\nThe only Belgian contribution to the literature of forensic medicine,\r\nother than articles in the journals, is a text-book by A. Dambre, first\r\npublished at Ghent in 1859.[135]\r\n\r\nTwo medico-legal works have been printed in the Japanese language, one\r\na report of the lectures of Professor Ernst Tiegel, at the University\r\nof Tokio,[136] the other a treatise by Katayama.[137]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the development of forensic medicine has kept pace\r\nwith that in the mother country. In an introductory address delivered\r\nat the University of Pennsylvania in 1810, the distinguished Dr.\r\nBenjamin Rush dwelt eloquently upon the importance of the subject.[138]\r\nIn 1813, Dr. James S. Stringham was appointed Professor of Medical\r\nJurisprudence in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New\r\nYork, and a syllabus of his lectures was published in the following\r\nyear.[139] At the same period (1812-13) Dr. Charles Caldwell delivered\r\na course of lectures on medical jurisprudence in the University of\r\nPennsylvania.[140] In 1815, Dr. T. R. Beck was appointed Lecturer on\r\nMedical Jurisprudence in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the\r\nWestern District of the State of New York; and soon after Dr. Walter\r\nCharming was appointed Professor of Midwifery and Medical Jurisprudence\r\nin Harvard University. In 1823, Dr. Williams, in the Berkshire Medical\r\nInstitute, and Dr. Hale, of Boston, each lectured upon the subject.[141]\r\n\r\nIn 1819, Dr. Thomas Cooper, formerly a judge in Pennsylvania, and at\r\nthat time Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy in the University of\r\nPennsylvania, reprinted, with notes and additions, the English works\r\nof Farr, Dease, Male, and Haslam.[142] The works of Ryan, Chitty,\r\nTraill, and Guy were also reprinted in this country shortly after their\r\npublication in England.\r\n\r\nIn 1823, Dr. Theodric Romeyn Beck published at Albany the first edition\r\nof a treatise as admirable for scholarly elegance of diction as for\r\nprofound scientific research. This remarkable work, _facile princeps_\r\namong English works on legal medicine, has had twelve American and\r\nEnglish editions, and has been translated into German and Swedish.[143]\r\n\r\nPapers upon medico-legal subjects or reports of lectures were published\r\nby J. W. Francis,[144] J. Webster,[145] R. E. Griffith,[146] R.\r\nDunglison,[147] J. Bell,[148] and S. W. Williams[149] between 1823\r\nand 1835. In 1840, Amos Dean, Professor of Medical Jurisprudence at\r\nthe Albany Medical College, published a medico-legal work, followed\r\nby another in 1854, which with the later work of Elwell are the only\r\ntreatises on forensic medicine upon the title-pages of which no\r\nphysician’s name appears.[150]\r\n\r\nNumerous papers and tracts upon medico-legal subjects were published by\r\nJ. J. Allen, T. D. Mitchell, H. Howard, D. H. Storer, J. S. Sprague,\r\nJ. S. Mulford, J. F. Townsend, and A. K. Taylor between 1840 and 1855.\r\nIn the latter year appeared the first edition of the admirable work of\r\nFrancis Wharton and Dr. Moreton Stillé, the first American product of\r\nthe collaboration of members of the two professions, now in its fourth\r\nedition.[151]\r\n\r\nBetween 1855 and 1860 no systematic treatises on legal medicine were\r\npublished, although the medical journals contained numerous articles\r\nbearing upon the subject. In 1860 the first edition of a treatise\r\nwritten from the legal aspect was published by J. J. Elwell.[152] In\r\n1869 Dr. J. Ordronaux, recently deceased, widely known as a teacher of\r\nlegal medicine and a graduate in law as well as in medicine, published\r\na treatise which has been extensively used as a text-book.[153] At the\r\npresent time the great number and variety of articles published in\r\nthe medical and legal journals, bearing upon every branch of forensic\r\nmedicine and of medical jurisprudence, and written for the most part\r\nby specialists, is evidence of the assiduity with which the science is\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nThe wide appreciation of the importance of medico-legal science in\r\nthe United States is also indicated by the fact that at the present\r\ntime there are but few medical schools in which the subject is not\r\ntaught. To ascertain the extent of medico-legal instruction at the\r\npresent time, a circular of inquiry was sent to the deans of 124\r\nmedical schools and of 56 law schools in the United States and British\r\nprovinces. Answers were received from 103 medical colleges. Of these\r\nonly 3 are without a teacher of “medical jurisprudence.” In 38 the\r\nteacher is a physician, in 50 he is a lawyer, in 5 he is a graduate\r\nin both professions, and 3 have two teachers, one a lawyer, the\r\nother a physician. The average number of lectures given is 21, and\r\nthe average in those schools in which the teacher is a lawyer, and\r\ntherefore presumably teaches only medical jurisprudence, is 15. The\r\nmedico-legal relations of their subjects are taught in their lectures\r\nby the neurologist in 62 schools, by the surgeon in 66, by the\r\nobstetrician in 69, and by the chemist (toxicology) in 91. It appears\r\nfrom these reports that not only is the importance of medico-legal\r\nscience appreciated, but that in the majority of our medical schools\r\nthe distinction between medical jurisprudence and forensic medicine\r\nis recognized in the fact that the instructor is a lawyer, who\r\npresumably teaches medical jurisprudence, while the different branches\r\nof forensic medicine and toxicology are taught by the specialists\r\nmost competent to deal with them. Every practising physician requires\r\nthorough instruction in medical jurisprudence, which, being strictly\r\nlegal, is best taught by one whose profession is the law. The general\r\npractitioner only requires so much knowledge of the different branches\r\nof forensic medicine as will enable him to intelligently fulfil his\r\nobligations in such medico-legal cases as will be forced upon him as\r\nresults of his ordinary practice. He can become a medical expert only\r\nby a particular study of and a large experience in some particular\r\nbranch of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn our law schools the teaching of medico-legal science is not as\r\ngeneral as in schools of medicine. Of 35 law schools, only 10 have\r\nprofessors of medical jurisprudence. Of these 6 are lawyers, 1 is a\r\nphysician, 2 are graduates in both professions, and 1 is a doctor of\r\ndivinity.\r\n\r\nIn this work the existence of specialists in the various branches\r\nof medico-legal science has been recognized for the first time in a\r\ntreatise in the English language. Each branch has been assigned to\r\na specialist in that subject, or at least to one who has made it a\r\nparticular study.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement of the matter, the primary division into the three\r\nsciences of medical jurisprudence, forensic medicine, and toxicology\r\nhas been adopted. The division of pure medical jurisprudence is\r\ncontained in the present volume, while the legal aspects of neurology,\r\nobstetrics, etc., will be treated of in future volumes along with the\r\nsubjects to which they relate. In the division of forensic medicine the\r\nclassification of Casper has been followed: _i.e._, _Thanatological_;\r\nincluding those branches in which the subject of inquiry is a dead body\r\n(contained in the present volume). _Bio-thanatological_; relating to\r\nquestions concerning both dead bodies and living persons (in the second\r\nvolume). _Biological_; relating to living persons (in the second and\r\nthird volumes). The applications of the microscope to forensic medicine\r\nwill be treated of in the second volume. The fourth volume will contain\r\nthe division relating to toxicology.\r\n\r\n  R. A.

But the importance of prescribing certain educational\r\nqualifications for those who made such practices their means of gaining\r\na livelihood soon became apparent, and as early as the year 1422,\r\nduring the reign of Henry the Fifth in England, an act of Parliament\r\nwas adopted forbidding any one, under a penalty of both fine and\r\nimprisonment, from “using the mysterie of fysyck unless he hath studied\r\nit in some university and is at least a batchellor of science.”\r\n\r\nAs a result of this and other statutory regulations, a class of\r\nprofessional men grew up, who were called “physicians,” because they\r\nprofessed to have the qualifications required by such legal regulations\r\nto wisely prescribe drugs and medicines for the cure of diseases.\r\nA chirurgeon or surgeon—Latin, chirurgus; Greek, _χειρουργος_,\r\ncompounded of _χειρ_, the hand, and _ἐργειν_, to work—as the\r\nderivation of the word shows, was one who professed to cure disease or\r\ninjuries by manual treatment and appliances.\r\n\r\nIt would be more interesting than profitable to trace the history\r\nof these terms, and of the professions of medicine and surgery from\r\nthe early times, when the clergy administered healing to the body as\r\nwell as to the soul, and when barbers were generally surgeons, and\r\nblood-letting by the knife-blade and the use of leeches caused the\r\ncommon application of the term “leech” to those who practised surgery.\r\n\r\n_Definition._—For the purposes of this treatise, however, it will\r\nbe sufficient to define the term “physician,” as meaning any one who\r\nprofesses to have the qualifications required by law to practise\r\nthe administration of drugs and medicines, and the term “surgeon,”\r\nas meaning any one who professes to have the like qualifications to\r\nperform surgical operations, for the cure of the sick or injured.\r\n\r\nFor a list of the early statutes of England relating to the practice of\r\nmedicine the reader may consult Ordronaux’ “Jurisprudence of Medicine,”\r\np. 5, note 2.\r\n\r\nThe present statutory regulations throughout the United States and in\r\nEngland and Canada will be more particularly referred to and synopsized\r\nhereafter in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nACQUIREMENT OF LEGAL RIGHT TO PRACTISE MEDICINE AND SURGERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Now Generally Regulated by Statute._—In nearly all of the United\r\nStates, as well as in England, France, Germany, and other civilized and\r\nintelligent communities, the legal right to practise the administration\r\nof drugs and medicines, or to perform operations in surgery for the\r\npurpose of curing diseases or injuries, has for many years been the\r\nobject of statutory legislation. The necessity and propriety of\r\nregulating by law such practices is generally conceded. It is manifest\r\nto all that a person engaging in the practice of medicine or surgery\r\nas a profession is holding himself out to the world, and especially to\r\nhis patients, as one qualified by education and experience to possess\r\nmore than ordinary skill and ability to deal with the great problems\r\nof health and life. He professes to the world that he is competent and\r\nqualified to enter into the closest and most confidential relations\r\nwith the sick and afflicted, and that he is a fit and proper person to\r\nbe permitted freely, and at all hours and all seasons, to enter the\r\nhomes, the family circle, and the private chamber of persons suffering\r\nfrom disease or injury. All this he professes and does upon his own\r\naccount, and for his own profit.\r\n\r\n=Statutory Regulation of the Right to Practise, Constitutional.=—The\r\nexercise by the States of these statutory powers is upheld as a valid\r\nexercise of the “police power,” to protect the health of the community.\r\nWhen the constitutionality of such enactments has been questioned,\r\nit has been attacked upon the alleged ground that the statutes under\r\nquestion unjustly discriminated in favor of one class of citizens and\r\nagainst another class; and as depriving those already engaged in the\r\npractice of medicine or surgery of “their property without due process\r\nof law.” State _v._ Pennoyer, 18 Atl. Rep., 878; _ex parte_ Spinney,\r\n10 Nev., 323; People _v._ Fulda, 52 Hun. (N. Y.), 65-67; Brown _v._\r\nPeople, 11 Colo., 109.\r\n\r\n_Opinion of United States Supreme Court._—This subject has been\r\ncarefully considered by the United States Supreme Court in a recent\r\ncase, and the broad extent of the legislative powers of the States to\r\nregulate such matters clearly and fully declared. Dent _v._ West Va.\r\n(129 U. S., 114). The Court say—pp. 121 _et seq._—Mr. Justice Field\r\ndelivering the opinion, in which all the other Justices concur: “The\r\nunconstitutionality asserted consists in its [the statutes] alleged\r\nconflict with the clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which declares\r\nthat no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\r\nwithout due process of law; the denial to the defendant of the right to\r\npractise his profession, without the certificate required, constituting\r\nthe deprivation of his vested right and estate in his profession, which\r\nhe had previously acquired.\r\n\r\n“It is undoubtedly the right of every citizen of the United States\r\nto follow any lawful calling, business, or profession he may choose,\r\nsubject only to such restrictions as are imposed upon all persons\r\nof like age, sex, and condition. This right may in many respects be\r\nconsidered as a distinguishing feature of our republican institutions.\r\nHere all vocations are open to every one on like conditions. All may\r\nbe pursued as sources of livelihood, some requiring years of study and\r\ngreat learning for their successful prosecution. The interest, or,\r\nas it is sometimes termed, the estate acquired in them, that is, the\r\nright to continue their prosecution, is often of great value to the\r\npossessors, and cannot be arbitrarily taken from them, any more than\r\ntheir real or personal property can be thus taken. But there is no\r\narbitrary deprivation of such right where its exercise is not permitted\r\nbecause of a failure to comply with conditions imposed by the State\r\nfor the protection of society. The power of the State to provide for\r\nthe general welfare of its people authorizes it to prescribe all such\r\nregulations as, in its judgment, will secure or tend to secure them\r\nagainst the consequences of ignorance and incapacity as well as of\r\ndeception and fraud. As one means to this end it has been the practice\r\nof different States, from time immemorial, to exact in many pursuits\r\na certain degree of skill and learning upon which the community may\r\nconfidently rely, their possession being generally ascertained upon\r\nan examination of the parties by competent persons, or inferred from\r\na certificate to them in the form of a diploma or license from an\r\ninstitution established for instruction on the subjects, scientific\r\nand otherwise, with which such pursuits have to deal. The nature and\r\nextent of the qualifications required must depend primarily upon the\r\njudgment of the State as to their necessity. If they are appropriate\r\nto the calling or profession, and attainable by reasonable study or\r\napplication, no objection to their validity can be raised because of\r\ntheir stringency or difficulty. It is only when they have no relation\r\nto such calling or profession, or are unattainable by such reasonable\r\nstudy and application, that they can operate to deprive one of his\r\nright to pursue a lawful vocation.\r\n\r\n“Few professions require more careful preparation by one who seeks\r\nto enter it than that of medicine. It has to deal with all those\r\nsubtle and mysterious influences upon which health and life depend,\r\nand requires not only a knowledge of the properties of vegetable and\r\nmineral substances, but of the human body in all its complicated\r\nparts, and their relation to each other, as well as their influence\r\nupon the mind. The physician must be able to detect readily the\r\npresence of disease, and prescribe appropriate remedies for its\r\nremoval. Every one may have occasion to consult him, but comparatively\r\nfew can judge of the qualifications of learning and skill which he\r\npossesses. Reliance must be placed upon the assurance given by his\r\nlicense, issued by an authority competent to judge in that respect,\r\nthat he possesses the requisite qualifications. Due consideration,\r\ntherefore, for the protection of society, may well induce the State to\r\nexclude from practice those who have not such a license, or who are\r\nfound upon examination not to be fully qualified. The same reasons\r\nwhich control in imposing conditions, upon compliance with which the\r\nphysician is allowed to practise in the first instance, may call for\r\nfurther conditions as new modes of treating disease are discovered, or\r\na more thorough acquaintance is obtained of the remedial properties\r\nof vegetable and mineral substances, or a more accurate knowledge\r\nis acquired of the human system and of the agencies by which it is\r\naffected. It would not be deemed a matter for serious discussion that\r\na knowledge of the new acquisitions of the profession, as it from time\r\nto time advances in its attainments for the relief of the sick and\r\nsuffering, should be required for continuance in its practice, but\r\nfor the earnestness with which the plaintiff in error insists that,\r\nby being compelled to obtain the certificate required, and prevented\r\nfrom continuing in his practice without it, he is deprived of his right\r\nand estate in his profession without due process of law. We perceive\r\nnothing in the statute which indicates an intention of the legislature\r\nto deprive one of any of his rights. No one has a right to practise\r\nmedicine without having the necessary qualifications of learning and\r\nskill; and the statute only requires that whoever assumes, by offering\r\nto the community his services as a physician, that he possesses such\r\nlearning and skill, shall present evidence of it by a certificate or\r\nlicense from a body designated by the State as competent to judge of\r\nhis qualifications. As we have said on more than one occasion, it may\r\nbe difficult, if not impossible, to give to the terms ‘due process\r\nof law’ a definition which will embrace every permissible exertion\r\nof power affecting private rights and exclude such as are forbidden.\r\nThey come to us from the law of England, from which country our\r\njurisprudence is to a great extent derived, and their requirement\r\nwas there designed to secure the subject against the arbitrary\r\naction of the crown and place him under the protection of the law.\r\nThey were deemed to be equivalent to ‘the law of the land.’ In this\r\ncountry the requirement is intended to have a similar effect against\r\nlegislative power, that is, to secure the citizen against any arbitrary\r\ndeprivation of his rights, whether relating to his life, his liberty,\r\nor his property. Legislation must necessarily vary with the different\r\nobjects upon which it is designed to operate. It is sufficient, for\r\nthe purposes of this case, to say that legislation is not open to the\r\ncharge of depriving one of his rights without due process of law, if\r\nit be general in its operation upon the subjects to which it relates,\r\nand is enforceable in the usual modes established in the administration\r\nof government with respect to kindred matters: that is, by process or\r\nproceedings adapted to the nature of the case.”\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY COMMON-LAW RULE CONCERNING SUITS BY PHYSICIANS.\r\n\r\nThe common-law rule was that the physician could not sue and recover\r\nfor his services, though he might for the medicines he furnished. The\r\ntheory of the law followed the etiquette of his profession and forbade\r\nhim from making a specific contract for pay for his services, and\r\nobliged him to receive what his patient chose to give him, which was\r\ncalled his “_honorarium_.”\r\n\r\n_The Early Common-Law Rule No Longer in Force._—As time went on this\r\ntheory vanished from the law. For many years it has lost its place\r\namong the rules of professional etiquette. In its stead statutory\r\nprovisions have been adopted which forbid a recovery for services\r\nperformed by persons not legally authorized to practise. The right to\r\ncontract with the patient or with those who employ the medical man, and\r\nhis remedies to enforce such contracts, will be treated of hereafter.\r\n\r\n_Statutory Regulations in New York State._—Most of the States of the\r\nUnited States have enacted statutory regulations prescribing in one\r\nform or another the necessary qualifications which entitle a physician\r\nor surgeon to practise, and prescribing penalties for practising\r\nwithout having complied with such statutory requirements. In the State\r\nof New York such matters were regulated for the first time by statute\r\nin 1787. This was followed by a general enactment on the subject of\r\nthe organization of county medical societies, and of State medical\r\nsocieties having boards of censors, to whom was committed the power to\r\nexamine applicants for license to practise, and of issuing licenses\r\n(Laws of 1813, p. 94). This law remained in force, with certain\r\nmodifications, until 1844, when all acts regulating the practice\r\nof medicine and surgery were repealed. A history of the statutory\r\nregulations in New York State up to the act of 1844 on this subject\r\nwill be found in the case of Bailey _v._ Mogg, 4 Denio, 60.[154]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the passage of the act of 1813, and for many years\r\nafterward, nearly all of the physicians in New York State practised\r\nin accordance with the theories and precepts of what is now called\r\nthe regular or allopathic school of medicine. That act provided that\r\nthe physicians in the respective counties of the State of New York\r\nshould meet in the respective counties and organize county medical\r\nsocieties. As a consequence of the fact that the physicians of that day\r\nwere chiefly of the allopathic school, they necessarily obtained the\r\ncontrol of the county medical societies and State medical societies.\r\nHence it became difficult, if not impossible, for physicians who\r\nwished to practise upon other theories and tenets than those obtaining\r\nin that school, to obtain licenses to do so. With the growth of the\r\nhomœopathic school of medicine and the eclectic school of medicine,\r\ncame applications to the legislature asking for those practising under\r\nthose schools the same rights and privileges of organizing county and\r\nState societies as had been extended to physicians generally by the\r\nact of 1813; so that in 1857, by Chapter 384, the legislature of New\r\nYork State enacted that the homœopathic physicians might meet in their\r\nrespective counties and organize county medical societies, with boards\r\nof censors having the same powers and privileges which were granted by\r\nthe act of 1813; and by other laws similar privileges were granted to\r\nthe so-called eclectic school. After the passage of the act of 1844,\r\ndown to about 1874, as hereinbefore stated, there was no limitation\r\nupon the right to practise medicine or surgery in this State.\r\n\r\nThe inharmonious and injurious effect of such policy of the State\r\nbecoming manifest, the legislature, by Chapter 436 of Laws of 1874,\r\nrequired all persons desiring to practise medicine or surgery to\r\nobtain a certificate as to their qualifications from the censors of\r\nsome one of these medical societies. By the Laws of 1880, Chapter 513,\r\nadditional and more extensive and particular provisions were made in\r\nreference to this matter, and all the physicians then practising were\r\nrequired, on or before the time limited in the act, to file with the\r\ncounty clerks of their respective counties their licenses to practise\r\ngranted by the censors of their county medical societies, or a diploma\r\nof some chartered school of medicine; and those persons who desired\r\nto become licensed who were not in practice were likewise required to\r\nobtain similar licenses or certificates and file the same. A diploma\r\nof a chartered school or medical college was given the same effect as a\r\nlicense issued by the censors.\r\n\r\n_Recent Legislation in New York State._—The whole matter, however,\r\nof licensing physicians to practise has, in the State of New York,\r\nbeen recently regulated by Chapter 468, Laws of 1889, and 499 of 1890,\r\nwhich have reference to the qualifications of persons becoming medical\r\nstudents, and Chapter 507 of 1890, which gives to the Regents of the\r\nUniversity of the State of New York power to select boards of examiners\r\nfrom persons nominated by each of the three State medical societies,\r\nviz., the New York State Medical Society, Homœopathic Medical Society,\r\nand Eclectic Medical Society. These boards prepare questions which are\r\nto be approved by the State Board of Regents; examinations are held\r\nin different parts of the State upon these questions, the examination\r\npapers are certified to that one of these boards of examiners which\r\nthe student may elect, and that board in turn certifies whether or\r\nnot the examination has been successfully undergone; and upon its\r\ncertificate the Board of Regents licenses the student to practise, and\r\nhis examination papers are filed in the office of the Board of Regents\r\nand become a matter of record. These provisions have been enlarged and\r\nmodified slightly by various statutes since enacted. They are all now\r\nembodied in Chapter 601 of Laws of 1893. They will be found carefully\r\nsynopsized below.\r\n\r\n_Penal Provisions in New York State._—The New York Penal Code, which\r\nwent into effect in 1882, enacted that a person practising medicine or\r\nsurgery, or pretending to be a physician or surgeon, without a license\r\nor a diploma from some chartered school, should be deemed guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment (Penal Code, Section\r\n356); and the same statute, 357, made it a misdemeanor for a person,\r\nwhether licensed or not, to practise medicine or surgery, or do any\r\nother act as a physician or surgeon, while intoxicated, by which the\r\nlife of any person is endangered or his health seriously affected.[155]\r\n\r\n_Giving “Patented” Medicines No Exception._—At one time an attempt was\r\nmade to claim, that under the patent laws of the United States a person\r\nhad the right to administer patent medicines without being punishable\r\nfor practising without a license, but this doctrine was repudiated by\r\nthe courts. Thompson _v._ Staats, 15 Wend., 395; Jordan v. Overseers,\r\netc., 4 Ohio, 295.\r\n\r\n_Courts may Compel Granting of License._—A person who is qualified\r\nand complies with reasonable rules of a licensing body, can compel\r\nsuch body to license him. This was held to be the law in the case of\r\nThe People _ex rel._ Bartlett _v._ The Medical Society of the County\r\nof Erie, which is also an important authority in respect to a vexed\r\nquestion of medical ethics. It appeared in that case that under the\r\ngeneral laws of New York in regard to the organization of medical\r\nsocieties, a medical society had refused to receive as a member a\r\nperson otherwise qualified, because he had advertised in the public\r\nprints a certain cure, including a mechanical appliance used in\r\ntreating throat troubles; it being forbidden by the code of ethics of\r\nthe American Medical Association, which the County Medical Society\r\nhad adopted as one of its by-laws, that a physician or surgeon should\r\nadvertise. The Court of Appeals of the State of New York held that this\r\nconstituted no defence to a proceeding instituted by such person to\r\nobtain a mandamus compelling the society to admit him to membership, if\r\notherwise qualified.[156]\r\n\r\nIt has also been decided that a medical society had no right to make\r\na by-law establishing a fixed fee-bill, or tariff of charges, and\r\nproviding for the expulsion of a member charging at a different rate\r\nthan that prescribed. Such a by-law was declared unreasonable and void\r\nin the case of People _v._ Medical Society of Erie County, 24 Barb.,\r\n570.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these decisions was, so far as they affect the validity\r\nof by-laws, attempted to be avoided in that State by Chapter 445 of\r\nLaws of 1866, by which it is expressly enacted that the county medical\r\nsocieties of the State of New York may make such rules and by-laws as\r\nthey see fit, “not inconsistent with the laws of said State, and may\r\nenforce them by expulsion or other discipline.” It may be considered\r\ndoubtful whether this legislation can accomplish its purpose in the\r\ncase of the adoption of a by-law void as against public policy.\r\n\r\n=No Particular Schools Recognized by the Courts.=—The general trend of\r\nthe decisions in all the States, whenever any questions in reference\r\nto schools of medicine have been before our courts, is to avoid\r\nrecognizing any particular system or school. The theory of the New\r\nYork courts upon this subject is well expressed by the liberal-minded\r\nand learned Judge Daly in the New York Court of Common Pleas, in the\r\ncase of Corsi _v._ Maretzek, 4 E. D. Smith, 1-5. In that case it was\r\nclaimed that a certificate of incapacity because of sickness, given\r\nby a “homœopathic” physician to an opera-singer, was not binding. It\r\nwas argued that the employment of a “homœopathic” physician under the\r\ncontract did not fulfil a provision thereof which required the event of\r\nthe singer’s sickness to be certified to by “a doctor,” to be appointed\r\nby the director.\r\n\r\nThe Court said: “The system pursued by the practitioner is immaterial.\r\nThe law has nothing to do with particular systems. Their relative\r\nmerit may become the subject of inquiry, when the skill or ability of\r\na practitioner in any given case is to be passed upon as a matter of\r\nfact. But the law does not, and cannot, supply any positive rules for\r\nthe interpretation of medical science. It is not one of those certain\r\nor exact sciences in which truths become established and fixed, but\r\nis essentially progressive in its nature, enlarging with the growth\r\nof human experience, and subject to those changes and revolutions\r\nincident to any branch of human inquiry, the laws of which are not\r\nfully ascertained. The labors of the anatomist, the physiologist, and\r\nthe chemist have contributed an immense storehouse of facts; but the\r\nmanner in which this knowledge is to be applied in the treatment and\r\ncure of diseases has been, and will probably continue to be, open to\r\ndiversity of opinion. No one system of practice has been uniformly\r\nfollowed, but physicians from the days of Hippocrates have been divided\r\ninto opposing sects and schools. The sects of the dogmatists and the\r\nempirics divided the ancient world for centuries, until the rise of\r\nthe methodics, who, in their turn, gave way to innumerable sects.\r\nTheories of practice, believed to be infallible in one age, have been\r\nutterly rejected in another. For thirteen centuries Europe yielded\r\nto the authority of Galen. He was implicitly followed—his practice\r\nstrictly pursued. Everything that seemed to conflict with his precepts\r\nwas rejected; and yet, in the revolutions of medical opinion, the\r\nworks of this undoubtedly great man were publicly burned by Paracelsus\r\nand his disciples; and for centuries following, the medical world\r\nwas divided between the Galenists and the chemists, until a complete\r\nascendency over both was obtained by the sect of the Vitalists. This\r\nstate of things has been occasioned by the circumstance that medical\r\npractitioners have often been more given to the formation of theories\r\nupon the nature of disease and the mode of its treatment, than to\r\nthat careful observation and patient accumulation of facts, by which,\r\nin other sciences, the phenomena of nature have been unravelled. I\r\nam far from undervaluing the great benefits conferred upon mankind\r\nby the study of medicine, and have no wish to minister to any vulgar\r\nprejudice against a useful and learned profession, but it is not to be\r\noverlooked that, as an art, it has been characterized, in a greater\r\ndegree, by fluctuations of opinion as to its principles and the mode\r\nof its practice, than, perhaps, any other pursuit. That it has been\r\ndistinguished by the constant promulgation and explosion of theories,\r\nthat it has alternated between the advancement of new doctrines and\r\nthe revival of old ones, and that its professors in every age have\r\nbeen noted for the tenacity with which they have clung to opinions,\r\nand the unanimity with which they have resisted the introduction of\r\nvaluable discoveries. They still continue to disagree in respect to the\r\ntreatment of diseases as old as the human race; and at the present day,\r\nwhen great advances have been made in all departments of knowledge, a\r\nradical and fundamental difference divides the allopathist from the\r\nfollowers of Hahnemann, to say nothing of those who believe in the\r\nsovereign instrumentality of water.\r\n\r\n“In fact, nothing comparatively is known of the philosophy of disease.\r\nIts eradication or cure, where the result of human agency is, in\r\nthe great majority of instances, attributable rather to the careful\r\nobservation, judgment and experience of the particular practitioner,\r\nthan to the application of general or established methods available to\r\nall. The popular axiom, that ‘doctors differ,’ is as true now as it\r\never was, and as long as it continues to be so, it is impossible for\r\nthe law to recognize any class of practitioners, or the followers of\r\nany particular system or method of treatment, as exclusively entitled\r\nto be regarded as doctors. In adverting to the conflicting views\r\nand differences of opinion, that exist and have ever existed in the\r\npractice of the healing art, it is not to call in question the value\r\nof learned, skilful and experienced physicians, but merely to show\r\nthe error of attempting, in the present state of medical science,\r\nto recognize, as matter of law, any one system of practice, or of\r\ndeclaring that the practitioner who follows a particular system is a\r\ndoctor, and that one who pursues a different method is not.” And see\r\nalso White _v._ Carroll, 42 N. Y., 161; Ordronaux’ “Jurisprudence of\r\nMedicine,” 27.\r\n\r\nThis decision was prior to the statute of 1874 and the provisions of\r\nthe Penal Code before noted. Since those statutes, it is a misdemeanor\r\nto practise except as permitted by the provisions of those statutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN NEW YORK AND ELSEWHERE PRACTITIONER WITHOUT LICENSE CANNOT SUE AND\r\nRECOVER FOR HIS FEES.\r\n\r\nSince the passage of the New York Act of 1844 (Laws of 1844, p. 406),\r\nthere has been no precise statutory provision in that State prohibiting\r\nin terms persons who practise physic or surgery without a license,\r\nfrom suing to obtain a recovery for services performed. But this is of\r\nlittle consequence, for, as we have already stated, so practising has\r\nbeen declared to be a misdemeanor by the Penal Code of New York.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-settled principle that when any act is declared by statute\r\nto be criminal, a contract calling for the performance of such an act\r\nis illegal and void. The early English authorities on this point are\r\nfully collated in Wheeler v. Russell (17 Metc., Mass., 258), and the\r\nlater English and American cases may be found in “American and English\r\nCyclopædia of Law,” title “Contracts,” Vol. III., p. 872 _et seq._; see\r\nalso _id._, Vol. XVIII., p. 440. Further consideration of the validity\r\nof contracts for medical and surgical services will be had hereafter.\r\nA full synopsis of the statutes of the different States regulating the\r\nlicensing of physicians and surgeons in force at the time this volume\r\ngoes to press will be placed in another chapter.\r\n\r\nIn a suit between a person who has performed medical and surgical\r\nservices, and one who employed him, it is said that the person\r\nperforming the services is presumed to have been licensed to do\r\nso.[157] If the State sues for a penalty, a different rule is claimed\r\nto prevail.[158]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MAY A DIPLOMA OR LICENSE BE PROVED IN A COURT OF LAW?\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the foregoing considerations that in any proceedings\r\nto punish for practising without license or legal authority, and in\r\nactions to recover payment for professional services in the States and\r\ncountries, where a license or diploma of a regularly chartered school\r\nor college is required by statute to entitle the person to practise, it\r\nmay become important to establish—first, the legal authority to grant\r\nthe license or diploma; and second, the genuineness of the license or\r\ndiploma produced. It frequently happens that the diploma or license has\r\nbeen obtained in another State or country. Under the New York statutes,\r\nespecially the laws of 1880 and 1890, it was made necessary to file a\r\ndiploma. When it had been issued by a chartered school of another State\r\nit must be certified to by some lawfully incorporated medical college\r\nin this State, before being received for filing, or regarded by the law\r\nas conferring upon its possessor the right to practise in that State.\r\n\r\nAs to the chief element of authenticity, namely, the legal\r\nincorporation or authority of the body or institution granting the\r\ndiploma, it is clear that the act of incorporation itself would be\r\nthe best evidence of the incorporation of the college or school, and\r\na special act granting the power to license to a board of censors or\r\nother official body or board would have to be produced to show the\r\nright vested in that board or body to grant a license. In Georgia it\r\nhas been held (Hunter _v._ Blount, 27 Ga., 76), that to prove a diploma\r\ngiven to a physician in another State, the existence of the college,\r\nand the fact of its being a chartered institution, must be shown by\r\nproducing its act of incorporation.\r\n\r\nIn Thornton’s case (8 Term Rep., 303; same case, 3 Esp., 4), it was\r\nheld that the mere production in court of a diploma under the seal\r\nof one of the universities, is not of itself evidence to show that\r\nthe person named in the diploma received the degree which the diploma\r\nspecified. In another and later case, however, Simpson _v._ Dunmore\r\n(9 M. & W., 45; same case, 5 Jurist, 1012), it was held that it was\r\nunnecessary for the person producing a license from the Apothecaries’\r\nCompany (an incorporated body) to practise as an apothecary, the seal\r\non which license was proved to be genuine, to give any additional\r\nevidence of his identity with the person named in the license. The\r\nreason for this doctrine is probably to be found in the well-known rule\r\nof evidence, that identity of both christian name and family name, is\r\nsufficient to raise a presumption of fact that the person bearing the\r\nname is the identical person so named in any written instrument.\r\n\r\nIn Walmsley _v._ Abbott (1 K. & P., 309; same case, 5 D. & R., 62),\r\nproof of the signature of one of the examiners who signed a certificate\r\nof examination was held sufficient to warrant the acceptance of the\r\ncertificate in evidence in the first instance. In another case the\r\nproof was that a person previously a stranger to the place went to a\r\ntown which was the seat of a university, and was told that a certain\r\nbuilding was the college, and that a certain person whom he saw there\r\nwas the librarian, and that this librarian showed him what purported\r\nto be the seal of the university, and also a book which the librarian\r\nstated was the book of acts or records of the university, and the seal\r\nso shown him was compared with the seal of a certain diploma, the\r\ngenuineness of which was in question, and a copy was made from the said\r\nbook of acts, of an entry stating that the degree of M. D. had been\r\nconferred by the university upon a person bearing the same name as that\r\nin the diploma, and this proof was held a sufficient authentication of\r\nthe diploma, and of the act or authority of the university conferring\r\nthe degree. Collins case, 1 Addison & Ellis, 695; same case, 3 N. & M.,\r\n703.[159]\r\n\r\n_The Rule in Criminal Prosecutions._—We have seen above, that in a\r\ncriminal prosecution the burden is on the defendant to produce and\r\nprove his license, but to warrant a conviction for practising without\r\na license it must be shown that the accused actually _practised_. It\r\nis not enough to show that he is called by persons whom he attends\r\npersonally, that is, for whom he prescribes, or to whom he gives\r\nmedicine or whom he treats. There must be proof shown that he has done\r\nthis on his own account or for his own profit. But proof of a single\r\nact connected with other circumstances, such as tend to show that he\r\nheld himself out as a physician, is enough. Burham _v._ State, 116\r\nInd., 112; Hill _v._ Bodie, 2 Stew. and P. (Ala.), 56; Pedgrift _v._\r\nSchiller, 8 C. B., N. S., 200 (same case, 6 Jurist, N. S., 1341). And\r\nif he simply practises “massage,” he does not fall within the acts\r\nagainst practising medicine, even though he pretends to accomplish as\r\nmuch good as could have been accomplished by a regular physician. Smith\r\n_v._ Lane, 24 Hun, N. Y., 632. But see also Leech _v._ Ripon, 12 Cent.\r\nL. J., 479; State _v._ Schultz, 11 Reporter, 701.[160]\r\n\r\n_Falsely Pretending to be a Licensed Practitioner Generally a\r\nMisdemeanor._—In some of the States, and in England, it is not\r\nonly made a misdemeanor to practise without a license, but falsely\r\npretending to be a licensed practitioner is made a misdemeanor. Such\r\nis the provision of the Penal Code of New York heretofore cited. In\r\nEngland such a statute has been somewhat strictly construed in the\r\ncase of Carpenter _v._ Hamilton (37 Law Times Rep., 157). In that\r\ncase it appeared that a person advertised himself as “John Hamilton,\r\nM.D.,” of the “Metropolitan Medical College of New York.” It further\r\nappeared that he was not registered as required by the law of England.\r\nIn a prosecution against him for falsely pretending to be a licensed\r\nphysician, the only proof of his practising being as just stated, an\r\nacquittal was sustained by a majority of the court, which held that it\r\nwas a question of fact to be determined by a trial court whether or\r\nnot what he did was _pretending_ to be a physician authorized to treat\r\na patient. The Court intimated that the person simply pretended to be\r\nwhat he really was, namely, a doctor of medicine of the Metropolitan\r\nMedical College of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE AND LOCAL BOARDS OF HEALTH—POWERS GOVERNED BY SPECIAL STATUTES.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the rules and regulations prescribed by the general\r\nstatutes, modern sanitary science has developed so broadly throughout\r\nmost of the civilized states and countries, that the different\r\ngovernments have established state boards of health, and in many\r\ninstances local boards of health, the latter being limited in their\r\nauthority and operation to specific municipal divisions, to which\r\nboards the government has committed the power to pass certain sanitary\r\nrules and regulations, which rules and regulations may have an\r\nimportant bearing upon and relation to the practice of medicine and\r\nsurgery. The jurisdiction and powers of these boards are to be found\r\nin the special statutes creating them, and prescribing their powers\r\nand duties, and cannot be treated of extensively here. They will be\r\nconsidered further under the special subjects to which they relate.\r\n\r\n_Physicians Bound to Report Contagious Cases and Not Liable for\r\nMistaken Report._—The duty to promptly report[161] to boards of\r\nhealth every case of contagious or infectious disease is manifest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOF THE CONTRACTUAL RELATION BETWEEN PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPLOYMENT AND RIGHTS IN REGARD TO COMPENSATION.\r\n\r\n_Legal Character of the Employment._—Whatever may have been the\r\ntheories of the Roman civil law, and following it of the early English\r\ncommon law, as to the character of the employment of physicians and\r\nother professional men, it is now so well settled that the reciprocal\r\nduties and obligations arising between physician and patient, or\r\nattorney and client, and the like, are to be classed under and\r\ngoverned by the law of contracts, that any extended discussion of\r\nthese theories is unnecessary here.[162] Mr. Ordronaux, in the second\r\nchapter of his interesting work on the “Jurisprudence of Medicine,”\r\nhas considered them fully, and has quoted amply from the books of the\r\nearlier and later text-writers, and from the expressions of the judges,\r\nto show what these theories and rules were; and he and all later\r\nauthorities agree that the ancient notion, that professional services\r\nare always gratuitous unless a special contract to pay for them is\r\nmade, has long been abandoned. He observes (pp. 13 and 14): “But in\r\nour day the increase in the number of professional practitioners, and\r\ntheir exclusive devotion to a special class of services as a means\r\nof living, has essentially modified the practical character of the\r\ncontracts with their patrons. Although in legal acceptation a mandate,\r\nyet from force of circumstances growing out of an altered state of\r\nsociety, the _mandate_ is practically changed into a contract of hire\r\n(_locatio operis_). _This doubtless reduces professions to the status\r\nof artisanship_, and places them on a par with manual labor, conjoined\r\nto the special skill of a particular calling. But it also simplifies\r\nthe contract, removes it from the category of innominate or imperfect\r\nobligations, requiring the intervention of legal fictions to furnish\r\na means for their enforcement, and brings it within the pale of\r\nconsensual agreements based upon a sufficient consideration.”\r\n\r\nThe physician’s right to sue on contract in England was declared by\r\nlegislative enactment by Chap. 90 (Sec. 31), 21 and 22 Victoria. It has\r\nnever been denied in the United States. Adams _v._ Stephens, 26 Wend.,\r\n451-455.\r\n\r\n_Physicians’ and Surgeons’ Service in a Sense Voluntary._—Though it\r\nis true, as in the case of many other doctrines of ancient law which\r\nwere formulated under social conditions far different from those which\r\nprevail in modern times, that these rules and theories have long\r\nsince lost their potency as distinct rules governing actions at law,\r\nnevertheless the legal aspect of the peculiar relationship between\r\nphysician and patient, is still affected by the idea that the service\r\non the part of the physician is voluntary—that is, the physician or\r\nsurgeon is not bound to come and perform services whenever or wherever\r\nhe is called. He is at liberty to refuse any and every patient who\r\nattempts to employ him.\r\n\r\n_Patients may Cease Employing at Any Time, unless there is a Contract\r\nfor a Certain Period._—And when he is employed, the patient may at any\r\nmoment discharge him, without incurring liability in damages, unless a\r\nspecial contract has been entered into between them that the services\r\nshall be rendered for a fixed period.\r\n\r\n_Service once Begun by Physician must be Continued until Notice of\r\nIntention to Cease is Given by Him._—If, however, the services are\r\nbegun, they must be continued until notice has been given of the\r\nintention to discontinue them, and a reasonable time allowed the\r\npatient to obtain the services of another person. The reasons for this\r\nrule will be considered more fully below.\r\n\r\n_Contracts either Express or Implied._—The contract between the\r\nphysician and patient may be an express one, that is, one in which all\r\nthe terms are agreed upon or _expressed_ between the parties, or it may\r\nbe what is called an implied contract, or one in which the patient, or\r\nanother person, simply calls on the physician or surgeon to come and\r\nperform services, and neither party specifically stipulates or agrees\r\nupon any of the terms of the employment.\r\n\r\n_Express Contracts may Include any Stipulation Not Contrary to Public\r\nPolicy._—In the case of an express contract the agreement of the\r\nparties settles and determines their mutual obligations, whether it\r\nbe written or merely verbal. But an express contract may also be made\r\nin such a form that certain conditions are required to be performed\r\nby the physician before he becomes entitled to any compensation for\r\nhis services. It may also embody an agreement that the patient shall\r\npay certain sums at certain times as the treatment goes on, or that no\r\nother physicians shall be employed without the consent of the attending\r\nphysician, or if so employed that they shall be under the direction of\r\nthe attending physician.\r\n\r\nAlmost anything may be stipulated which is not contrary to public\r\npolicy, and a breach of any such stipulation entitles the aggrieved\r\nparty to rescind the contract and cease from performing it.[163]\r\n\r\n_Qualifications of the Rule that Express Contracts may Include any\r\nStipulation._—Some qualifications of this rule of law must, however,\r\nbe noted. A breach by the patient of any one of these stipulations\r\nwould entitle the physician to treat the engagement as terminated like\r\nany other contractual relation, and to bring his action for a recovery\r\nfor services rendered up to the time of the breach; but it is doubtful\r\nwhether he would have any action for damages for failure to permit him\r\nto perform further services. This doubt arises from the legal doctrine,\r\nhereinbefore referred to, that a patient is always at liberty to\r\ndismiss his physician at any time without notice, and without assigning\r\nany cause, which recognizes and grows out of the fact that if the trust\r\nand confidence of the patient are destroyed, or impaired, no matter how\r\nunreasonably or unjustly, the relation between them must thereafter\r\nbe unprofitable to both parties, and dangerous to the patient. On the\r\nother hand there is little doubt but that whenever an express contract\r\nis made by a physician to treat a patient for a certain length of time\r\nfor a particular disease or injury, the physician is not at liberty to\r\narbitrarily terminate that relation or his connection with the case,\r\nunless he has in the contract specifically reserved the right so to do.\r\n\r\n_Contracts Making Payment Contingent upon Successful Treatment\r\nValid._—The express contract between the parties may also contain a\r\nstipulation, by which the physician makes his compensation contingent\r\nupon his effecting a cure. Smith _v._ Hyde, 19 Vt., 54; Mack _v._\r\nKelly, 3 Ala., 387. See also Coughlin _v._ N. Y. Cen. R. R. Co., 71\r\nN. Y., 443. In such a case, however, if the patient does not permit\r\nthe physician opportunity to treat him during the time named in the\r\ncontract, or for a reasonable time, if no specific time is fixed, the\r\ncourts would probably permit the physician to recover a reasonable\r\ncompensation for his services for the time during which he treated his\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n_Physician must Allow Reasonable Time to Supply his Place if he\r\nQuits his Patient._—In any event, whether the contract be express\r\nor implied, conditional or unconditional, the law through motives of\r\npublic policy, and with a just regard for the welfare of the sick and\r\ninjured, undoubtedly requires that if a physician has once taken charge\r\nof a case, and determines to abandon it, he must give the patient\r\nreasonable notice and reasonable opportunity to supply his place. If he\r\nfails to do this he is liable in damages for the results that follow as\r\nthe proximate consequence of his abandoning the case.\r\n\r\n_This Rule True even in the Case of a Charity Patient._—This is true,\r\nit is believed, even when the patient is a charity patient, and the\r\nservices are gratuitous. Shiels _v._ Blackburn (1 H. Blacks., 159). For\r\nany other rule less strict might entail the most serious consequences.\r\nOrdronaux, “Jur. of Med.,” 13 and 14, citing Inst., lib. 3, 26, 11;\r\nPothier, “Du Contrat Mandat,” Chap. I., § 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMENTS OF THE CONTRACT BETWEEN PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT.\r\n\r\n_Duties of Physician._—When the relations between physician and\r\npatient are not defined otherwise by express contract, the implied\r\ncontract is, and the law presumes, that the physician contracts, first,\r\nto use the necessary care and attention; second, to use the necessary\r\nskill; third, in case the physician furnishes his own medicines (and\r\nthe obligation to furnish them would probably be imposed, if it was the\r\ncustom of the school or class of physicians to which the particular\r\nphysician belonged to do so), that the medicines are proper and\r\nsuitable. As a corollary of these duties it necessarily follows, also,\r\nthat the physician contracts that the instruments or appliances which\r\nhe uses are free from taint or contagion, and are suitable and proper\r\nfor the uses to which they are put. Upon this theory an action could be\r\nmaintained against a physician for using impure vaccine.\r\n\r\n_Duties of Patient._—The patient on his part contracts, first, to\r\ngive the physician information concerning the facts and circumstances\r\nof the case, and full opportunity to treat him properly; second, to\r\nobey his instructions and follow his directions, and, third, to pay\r\nhim the reasonable worth and value of his services. The different\r\nbranches of this contract are reciprocal. The failure of either party\r\nto fulfil the obligation of any one of them which is imposed upon\r\nhim, would bar him of his remedies against the other party to recover\r\ndamages for any breach, or any proximate result of his breach, of\r\nsuch obligations. The necessary care and attention required of the\r\nphysician in such a case are measured by the requirements of the case\r\nand the physician’s duties to his other patients, modified, however,\r\nby the rule that the physician is presumed to know, at the time he\r\ntakes up the case, the condition and situation of his other patients\r\nat that time. Consequently, if those who have first employed him are\r\nso situated at the time that his services for them are likely to be\r\nsoon and continuously required, he cannot without making himself liable\r\nin damages undertake another case and then neglect it, but he should\r\neither decline to take it, or should with the full knowledge and\r\nconsent of the patient make provision for the temporary substitution\r\nof some other physician, during the time that his prior obligations\r\nengross his attention. Nevertheless, if the situation and condition of\r\nthose to whom he has first contracted his services is such that he had,\r\nalthough he exercised due professional knowledge and skill, no reason\r\nto apprehend that these patients would need his exclusive service,\r\nand by a sudden development, arising from those occult causes which\r\nobtain in all serious diseases and injuries, any of his prior patients\r\nsuffer a sudden and dangerous relapse, or from an accession of new and\r\ndangerous symptoms and conditions so that he must fly to their aid,\r\nhe would not be liable to another patient, to whom he had afterward\r\ncontracted his services, for neglecting his case; still he should in\r\nsuch instances use extra means to obtain the services of some other and\r\nequally skilful man.\r\n\r\n_Only Ordinary and Usual Skill Required._—The degree and character\r\nof necessary skill contracted for has been variously defined by the\r\ncourts. When malpractice is discussed, a more extended consideration\r\nof this matter will be required. At present the doctrine laid down\r\nin Shearman and Redfield on “Negligence,” paragraphs 433-435, may be\r\nadopted. It is as follows:\r\n\r\n“Although a physician or surgeon may doubtless by express contract\r\nundertake to perform a cure absolutely, the law will not imply such\r\na contract from the mere employment of a physician. A physician is\r\nnot an insurer of a cure, and is not to be tried for the result of\r\nhis remedies. His only contract is to treat the case with reasonable\r\ndiligence and skill. If more than this is expected it must be expressly\r\nstipulated for.... The general rule, therefore, is, that a medical\r\nman, who attends for a fee, is liable for such want of ordinary care,\r\ndiligence or skill on his part as leads to the injury of his patient.\r\nTo render him liable, it is not enough that there has been a less\r\ndegree of skill than some other medical man might have shown, or a less\r\ndegree of care than even himself might have bestowed; nor is it enough\r\nthat he himself acknowledged some degree of want of care; there must\r\nhave been a want of competent and ordinary care and skill, and to such\r\na degree as to have led to a bad result.... But a professed physician\r\nor surgeon is bound to use not only such skill as he has, but to have\r\na reasonable degree of skill. The law will not countenance quackery;\r\nand although the law does not require the most thorough education or\r\nthe largest experience, it does require that an uneducated, ignorant\r\nman shall not, under the pretence of being a well-qualified physician,\r\nattempt recklessly and blindly to administer medicines or perform\r\nsurgical operations. If the practitioner, however, frankly informs his\r\npatient of his want of skill, or the patient is in some other way fully\r\naware of it, the latter cannot complain of the lack of that which he\r\nknew did not exist.”[164]\r\n\r\n_Average Standard of Skill of any Professed School must be\r\nAttained._—It is also a rule that one who professes to adhere to\r\na particular school must come up to its average standard, and must\r\nbe judged by its tests, and in the light of the present day. Thus a\r\nphysician who would practise the reckless and indiscriminate bleeding\r\nwhich was in high repute not very many years ago, or should shut up\r\na patient in fever and deny all cooling drinks, would doubtless find\r\nthe old practice a poor excuse for his imbecility. So, if a professed\r\nhomœopathist should violate all the canons of homœopathy, he would\r\nbe bound to show some very good reasons for his conduct, if it was\r\nattended with injurious effects. Upon many points of medical and\r\nsurgical practice all of the schools are agreed, and indeed common\r\nsense and universal experience prescribe some invariable rules, to\r\nviolate which may generally be called gross negligence. Yet the patient\r\ncannot justly complain if he gets only that quality and kind of service\r\nfor which he bargains. If he employs a cheap man, he must expect cheap\r\nservice. Puffendorf, in his “Law of Nature and Nations,” observes:\r\n“We read a pleasant story of a man who had sore eyes and came to a\r\nhorse-doctor for relief. The doctor anointed his eyes with the same\r\nointment he used among his horses, upon which the man falls blind,\r\nand the cause is brought before the judge, who acquits the physician.\r\nFor if the fellow, says he, had not been an ass he had never applied\r\nhimself to a horse-doctor.” See also Jones on Bailments, 100; 1 Field’s\r\n“Lawyers’ Briefs,” sub. Bailments, Sec. 573; Musser _v._ Chase, 29 Ohio\r\nSt., 577; Lanphier _v._ Phipos, 8 Carr. & Payne, 478.\r\n\r\n_Degree of Care and Skill Used a Question of Fact._—In an action\r\nat law, whether brought by a physician to recover for his services,\r\nor by a patient to recover for malpractice or neglect, it is always\r\na question of fact, to be determined by the jury under proper\r\ninstructions as to the measure of care and skill required, whether or\r\nnot the physician has in a given case used that degree of care and\r\ndisplayed that amount of skill which might reasonably be expected of a\r\nman of ordinary ability and professional skill. These same rules apply\r\nto the surgeon. He must possess and exercise that degree of knowledge\r\nand sense which the leading authorities have announced, as a result of\r\ntheir researches and experiments up to the time, or within a reasonable\r\ntime before, the issue or question to be determined is made.[165]\r\n\r\n_Rule in Leading Case of Lanphier v. Phipos._—In the case of Lanphier\r\n_v._ Phipos, 8 C. & P., 478, already cited, Chief Justice Tyndall\r\nenunciated the rule as to the degree of skill required of a physician\r\nor surgeon, which has been followed by all the courts since then. He\r\nsaid: “Every person who enters into a learned profession undertakes to\r\nbring to the exercise of it a reasonable degree of care and skill. He\r\ndoes not, if he is an attorney, undertake at all events to gain the\r\ncause, nor does a surgeon undertake that he will perform a cure; nor\r\ndoes the latter undertake to use the highest possible degree of skill,\r\nas there may be persons of higher education and greater advantages\r\nthan himself; but he undertakes to bring a fair, reasonable and\r\ncompetent degree of skill. And in an action against him by a patient,\r\nthe question for the jury is whether the injury complained of must be\r\nreferred to a want of proper degree of skill and care in the defendant,\r\nor not. Hence he is never presumed to engage for extraordinary skill,\r\nor for extraordinary diligence and care. As a general rule, he who\r\nundertakes for a reward to perform any work is bound to use a degree\r\nof diligence, attention and skill, adequate to the performance of his\r\nundertaking; that is, to do it according to the rules of the art;\r\n_spondet peritiam artis_. And the degree of skill arises in proportion\r\nto the value and delicacy of the operation. But he is in no case\r\nrequired to have more than ordinary skill, for he does not engage for\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n_Physician Must Instruct Patient how to Care for Himself, etc._—A\r\ncorollary of these rules is, that the physician must give proper\r\ninstruction to his patient how to take care of himself, how to manage a\r\ndiseased or injured member, when and how to take any medicines that may\r\nbe prescribed, what diet to adopt, and that in case the physician fails\r\nto give these instructions he is liable for any injuries that result\r\nfrom this failure. Carpenter _v._ Blake, _supra_.\r\n\r\n_Patient Must Inform Physician Fully Concerning his Case—His\r\nCommunications Privileged._—On the other hand, as we have already\r\nstated, the patient owes the duty to his physician of informing him\r\nfully of all the varied symptoms of his disease, or the circumstances\r\nattending his injury, and to freely and with due confidence answer\r\nall questions concerning his past history which would tend to throw\r\nany light upon his present condition. To battle with the occult\r\nforces which play so important a part in determining the course or\r\nconsequences of disease, it is absolutely essential that the physician\r\nshould know all that is possible to be known of the patient’s history,\r\nand of the history of the patient’s family. As we shall see later on,\r\nall such communications are, in most of the States of the Union and\r\nelsewhere, by statutory enactment made privileged, and without the\r\nconsent of the patient the physician or surgeon is absolutely forbidden\r\nto divulge any communication or information which he receives in order\r\nto enable him to prescribe. This rule applies equally whether the\r\nphysician or surgeon is acting for hire or is treating the person as a\r\ncharity patient, and it has been extended by construction by the courts\r\nin some States, so as to include examinations made by jail physicians\r\nor other physicians sent by the prosecuting officials of the State to\r\nexamine a prisoner, for purpose of giving evidence, but who allowed\r\nthe prisoner to suppose that they were there simply to treat him in\r\ntheir professional capacity. People _v._ Murphy, 101 N. Y., 126. At\r\nthe same time the courts have been careful to make an exception in the\r\ncase of advice given for the purpose of enabling the person receiving\r\nthe advice to commit a crime, and of any information received by the\r\nphysicians while the persons asking for it were engaged in a criminal\r\nattempt. All of these interesting questions will be examined and\r\ntreated of at length hereafter.[166]\r\n\r\n_Conditions of Contract Between Physician and Patient Further\r\nConsidered._—It has been observed that the contract between the\r\nphysician and patient may be conditional or unconditional. By this it\r\nis meant that limitations upon the reciprocal obligations between them\r\nmay be imposed, or extensions of such obligations made, by special\r\nagreement. The physician may contract to cure, and may make the cure\r\na condition precedent to receiving any reward for his services or\r\nmedicaments, and a breach of such a contract will be enforced by\r\nthe courts as a bar to an action for services rendered or medicines\r\nfurnished. The patient may agree to come to the physician’s home or to\r\na hospital or other place agreed upon between them, for the purpose of\r\nbeing treated, or of being operated upon by a surgeon, and a failure\r\nto perform such an agreement on the part of the patient absolves the\r\nmedical man from carrying out his agreement to treat the patient.\r\nIn the case already suggested of a request by the medical man for\r\ninformation as to the patient’s past history, or that of the patient’s\r\nfamily, or the circumstances concerning the injury or symptoms of\r\nthe disease, if the patient should give false information, or should\r\nwilfully neglect to give true information, the physician would have a\r\nright, upon giving reasonable and due notice, and opportunity to employ\r\nsome one else, as already intimated, to decline to proceed further with\r\nhis care of the case, and might sue and recover pay for the services\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\n_Physicians Cannot Contract that they shall Not be Responsible for\r\nWant of Ordinary Care and Skill._—An important and salutary exception\r\nto the general rule that all parties may contract freely as between\r\nthemselves stipulations measuring their reciprocal obligations,\r\ndoubtless applies to the relations between physician and patient.\r\nIt is an exception which has been applied to the contract relations\r\nexisting between a common carrier and a shipper or a passenger. This is\r\nthat persons contracting to perform services which are to a certain\r\nextent public in their nature, and which, as in the case of the common\r\ncarrier or in the case of the physician or surgeon, are founded\r\nupon conventional relations, and affect the public welfare, are not\r\npermitted, from reasons of public policy, to contract for a release or\r\nescape from liability arising out of their own negligence or wrong. In\r\nshort, a physician or surgeon cannot contract with a patient that the\r\npatient shall waive any claim for damages growing out of his want of\r\nordinary care and skill. Nevertheless, the physician or surgeon may\r\nfrankly inform his patient of his want of knowledge and experience as\r\nto the particular kind of treatment required by any special and unusual\r\ndisease or injury. If after full information on this point, and full\r\nopportunity to employ some one else, the patient insists that the\r\nphysician or surgeon go on with such treatment as he is able to give\r\nto the case, and injuries result which a more skilful and experienced\r\npractitioner might have avoided, it is probable that the courts would\r\nhold that the practitioner was not liable under such circumstances,\r\nor that such circumstances could be pleaded in mitigation of damages.\r\nBut it would be the duty of the practitioner in such a case to be\r\nexceedingly careful in performing any surgical operations, and not\r\nadminister any powerful drugs with the strength and medicinal qualities\r\nof which he was not acquainted. If he should assume to perform such\r\noperations or administer such drugs instead of confining himself to\r\nmodifying the ravages of disease by the use of well-known simple\r\nremedies, or protecting against the consequences of severe injury by\r\nthe use of ordinary antiseptic dressings and treatment, he would no\r\ndoubt be liable for any resulting damage, and could not recover pay for\r\nhis service.\r\n\r\n_Experiments Not to be Tried on Patients—This Rule Applies to Charity\r\nPatients._—For like reasons of public policy it has been held that a\r\nphysician has no right to try experiments on his patient.[167] In this\r\nrespect a charity patient will be protected by law and compensated for\r\ndamages received from experiments on his health and person, just as\r\nmuch as a person from whom a large fee could be expected. Humanity and\r\npublic policy both forbid that experiments should be tried upon one\r\nclass of patients any more than another. However this may be, in a\r\ncase of extreme danger, where other resorts have failed and everything\r\nelse done that could reasonably be required, and if the patient and\r\nhis family consent after full information of the dangerous character\r\nof the operation, or the unknown qualities and powers of the drug to\r\nbe administered, the practitioner would be justified and protected if\r\nsome new methods of treatment not entirely developed or known to the\r\nprofession, but supposed to be efficacious, should be adopted, although\r\nthe result might prove unfavorable. In such a case, however, it would\r\nbe extremely perilous for the physician to stand upon his own judgment\r\nalone. He should consult the best talent in his profession available,\r\nand abide by the judgment of his colleagues or a fair majority of them;\r\nand even then should apply to his course of action the maxim. When in\r\ndoubt run no risks; better let a patient perish from disease or injury,\r\nthan while attempting uncertain experiments with the surgeon’s knife\r\nor the use of dangerous drugs. The safe rule is to take no chances,\r\nunless there is a consensus of judgment of several physicians. It\r\nmay be objected that if no experiments are tried no new medicines or\r\nsurgical devices could be discovered, or their effects observed. The\r\nanswer to this objection is that vivisection, and other experiments\r\nupon live animals, permit of experimentation to a considerable degree,\r\nand often effectually point out the proper course of treatment of the\r\nhuman subjects. In the case of drugs and medicines the practice is well\r\nknown of physicians trying the effects thereof upon their own persons,\r\nin their zeal and anxiety to give to the world new discoveries. But,\r\nas heretofore observed, the law does not recognize the right of the\r\nmedical or surgical practitioner to tamper with his patients’ health by\r\nthe use of untried experiments, without imposing upon the practitioner\r\nliability for all injuries proximately resulting from their use. All\r\nof such matters will, however, fall more properly under consideration\r\nwhen the liability of the physician and surgeon for malpractice is\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE LEGAL RIGHT OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS TO RECOVER COMPENSATION\r\nFOR SERVICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liability to Pay for Services._—An important matter for physicians\r\nand surgeons is the question as to who is responsible, or liable to pay\r\nfor their services. If there is an express contract this question does\r\nnot arise; but in most instances the person performing the services\r\nrenders them upon call, and it is necessary for him to understand his\r\nlegal right to recover pay for services in the absence of an express\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\n_Person Treated, and not Person calling in Physician, Employs Him\r\nand is Liable._—In the first place, it must be stated as a general\r\nproposition that the person for whom the services are actually\r\nrendered, or upon whom the operation is performed, is bound to pay for\r\nthem, if otherwise capable in law of making contracts and incurring\r\nobligations. And secondly, that one who calls a physician or surgeon\r\nto attend a patient is not presumed to have contracted to pay for the\r\nservices rendered, unless his relations with the patient are such that\r\nhe would be obligated in law to pay, even if he had not himself called\r\nin the medical man.\r\n\r\nIn the first case it is presumed that the patient is liable, because he\r\nreceives the benefit of the services, and nothing less than a distinct\r\nunderstanding that he was not to pay will relieve him from this\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\n_Married Women and Infants Generally Not Liable._—Where such a person\r\nis a married woman, unless the case arises in States or countries\r\nwhere married women have been declared by statutes to be liable\r\nthe same as if single, this rule does not obtain. Nor is an infant\r\npersonally liable when he is living with his parent or guardian. Hull\r\n_v._ Connelly, 3 McCord (S. C.), 6; Klein _v._ La Amoreaux, 2 Paige\r\nCh., 419; Atchinson _v._ Bruff, 50 Barb., 384; Wilcox _v._ Smith, 26\r\nBarb., 341. But the contract of an infant for medicine and medical\r\nattendance is deemed a contract for necessaries, and will be held\r\nvalid and enforced against his estate if there is no person standing\r\n_in loco parentis_ who can be held liable. 3 Barn. & Cress., 484; 2\r\nKent Com., 236. In cases when the parent of the infant or the husband\r\nof the married woman is liable, this liability obtains because the\r\nservices rendered are deemed necessary, and fall within the common-law\r\nobligation of such persons to provide and pay for necessaries for those\r\nwhom they are bound to support and maintain.\r\n\r\n_Burden upon Physicians Treating Minors to Show Services\r\nNecessary._—But even in such cases the burden is upon the person\r\nperforming the services, to show that they were necessary, and it is\r\nhis duty to know, or learn, the true legal status of the patient, and\r\nthe true legal relations of the patient to the person other than the\r\npatient from whom payment is to be claimed. As said in the case of\r\nCrain _v._ Baudouin (55 N. Y., 256-261), “in the case of minor children\r\neven, the law imposes this duty upon those who would furnish them with\r\nnecessaries, relying upon the credit of their fathers, and seeking\r\nto charge them. (Hunt _v._ Thompson, 3 Scam., 179; Van Valkinburgh\r\n_v._ Watson, 13 J. R., 480).” “_A fortiori_, it is so in the case of\r\nan adult married daughter living with her husband.” And as to the\r\nliability of the husband of a married woman in the absence of statute\r\ngiving her legal capacity to contract and charge her separate estate.\r\nConsult Moody _v._ Osgood, 50 Barb., 628; Potter _v._ Virgil, 67 Barb.,\r\n578; Crain _v._ Baudouin, 55 N. Y., 256-261.\r\n\r\n_Mother of Infant probably Liable after Father’s Death._—It has been\r\na much disputed question whether after the father’s death the mother\r\nbecomes responsible for necessaries furnished for her minor children.\r\nThe theory of law upon which a father is made liable proceeds upon the\r\nground that he is bound to support the child and has a right to the\r\nchild’s services during its minority.[168] It has been held that the\r\nmother after the death of the father is entitled to those services.\r\nCampbell _v._ Campbell, 3 Stock. (N. J.), 265; Cain _v._ Dewitt, 8\r\nIowa, 116; Furman _v._ Van Size, 56 N. Y., 435-439, disapproving\r\nBentley _v._ Richtmeyer (4 Comstock, 38), and approving _In re_ Ryder,\r\n11 Paige, 185. If she is entitled to the services of her child, she\r\nmust be bound to support and care for it; and so it was held in Furman\r\n_v._ Van Size cited above.\r\n\r\n_Estates of Insane Persons Liable in a Proper Case._—Persons of\r\nunsound mind are liable for necessaries furnished for their benefit,\r\nand can be made to pay therefor at reasonable and proper rates, but\r\nthey cannot make contracts for a specific rate. It is always a question\r\nof fact as to what sum should be charged against their estates, if they\r\nhave any.\r\n\r\n_Master Not Liable for Services Rendered Servant without Special\r\nContract._—In the case of master and servant, while at common law as\r\nbetween a master and servant the master was bound to provide medicine\r\nand food for the servant when the servant was an inmate of the master’s\r\nhouse, this is an obligation which a third person could not enforce,\r\nand the master can only be held liable for services rendered to the\r\nservant, upon proof of a specific contract with him to pay for them.\r\n\r\n _Case of Crain v. Baudouin Considered._—The case of Crain _v._\r\n Baudouin, _supra_, affords an interesting discussion before the\r\n highest court of New York State, as to the question as to how far a\r\n father calling a physician for an adult child for whom he is not bound\r\n to provide, although lying sick at the father’s house, can be held\r\n liable for the services rendered upon such call. In that case the\r\n plaintiff attended as a physician upon the daughter of the defendant,\r\n who was sick at his house. The daughter was of full age, married and\r\n living with her husband, but was brought from that of her husband to\r\n that of her father in order that she might be under the care of her\r\n mother. Defendant was present when plaintiff made his calls, gave the\r\n latter a history of the patient’s illness, and received directions\r\n as to her treatment. He told others of the frequency and length of\r\n the plaintiff’s visits, and of his opinion of the case, without any\r\n disclaimer of liability. The Court held, however, that these facts\r\n were insufficient to imply a promise on the father’s part to pay\r\n for the services, and that the additional facts that the defendant\r\n consented to the calling in of a consulting physician, and that a bill\r\n was sent in by the plaintiff, unless acknowledged and acquiesced in by\r\n defendant, or that he had before this employed other physicians, were\r\n also insufficient to raise an implication of law of such a promise\r\n to pay. The plaintiff relied in his argument upon the fact that the\r\n patient was a daughter of the defendant, but the Court held that any\r\n presumption which might arise from this had the daughter been under\r\n age, was overcome by the fact that she was past a majority, and was\r\n married and lived with her husband and children. The plaintiff also\r\n relied to support his cause of action upon the interest exhibited\r\n by the defendant in the course of treatment pursued, and the other\r\n facts as to the presence of the defendant when the plaintiff made\r\n his professional calls alone and in consultation; his receiving\r\n directions as to treatment; his recognition to others of the fact that\r\n the plaintiff was in attendance; his reciting to others a knowledge\r\n of the frequency and length of the visits of plaintiff without any\r\n disclaimer on the part of the defendant of liability. The Court said\r\n as to these facts: “It is true that particular acts will sometimes\r\n give rise to particular obligations, duties and liabilities. But the\r\n party whose acts are thus to affect him must be in such predicament\r\n as that those acts have, of legal necessity, a significance attached\r\n to them, at the time, which he may not afterward repel.... It has\r\n been held that a special request by a father to a physician to attend\r\n upon his son, then of full age but lying sick at the father’s house,\r\n raised no implied promise on the part of the father to pay for the\r\n services rendered.” See Boyd _v._ Sappington, 4 Watts (Pa.), 247; and\r\n so in Veitch _v._ Russell, 3 Ad. & Ell. (N. S.), 927, it is said:\r\n “A physician attends in every case on request; that fact alone is\r\n not enough for the inference of a special contract;” and see Sellen\r\n _v._ Norman, 4 Carr. & P., 284. Still less where there has been no\r\n special request by the father to the physician, and no more than\r\n acquiescence in his calls. As it would be unnatural for the parent\r\n of an invalid child, though legally emancipated, or for an intimate\r\n and confidential friend of hers, not to know the rise and course of\r\n her malady, not to be interested in the state of it as disclosed at\r\n any time to skilled inspection, not to be so anxious as to be in\r\n waiting when scientific skill was to be applied for its cure, not to\r\n be ready to receive directions for treatment in the intervals; so it\r\n is not to be implied in the one case more than in the other that,\r\n from these manifestations, because unaccompanied with an express\r\n repudiation of liability, a liability may be implied. They are to be\r\n referred to natural affection and friendly sympathy, rather than to\r\n an acquiescence in the rendition of a personal benefit, or counted as\r\n acts done under a sense of legal obligation.” The Court further said\r\n that “even if it should be assumed that the usage exists that the\r\n physician called to consult with him who is in attendance, with the\r\n consent of the person who has employed the latter, is in contemplation\r\n of law in the hire of that person, still the assent of the defendant\r\n to the calling in of the consulting physician, and his expression of\r\n desire to be present when he came—until he is shown to have employed\r\n the plaintiff—is a basis too weak for an implication of law, that\r\n he promised to pay his consultation fees. Still less it is a fact\r\n from which to imply a promise to pay the plaintiff.” This case is,\r\n however, close to the border line, and it may be well criticised\r\n and denied its apparent full weight of authority, notwithstanding\r\n the very great learning and ability of the learned Judge Folger,\r\n who wrote the opinion, upon the ground that it appears that the\r\n father had as a witness expressly denied calling in the plaintiff or\r\n authorizing anybody to call him in, or authorizing the employment of a\r\n consulting physician, and that on the trial the Court had found upon\r\n the whole testimony in the case that the defendant had never employed\r\n the plaintiff. Taking the decision as a whole it cannot be regarded\r\n as determining that upon such a set of circumstances as is there\r\n disclosed, the father could not in any event have been held liable,\r\n but rather that the trial court having found upon the whole testimony\r\n that the defendant was not liable, having witnesses before it fully\r\n able to judge of their capability, the appellate court could not say\r\n as a matter of law that a finding in favor of the defendant should be\r\n overruled. This case is considered here at some length chiefly for\r\n the purpose of affording an illustration to physicians and surgeons\r\n which will suggest to them the advisability of care in ascertaining in\r\n all cases who is responsible for their charge for services.

C.), 42.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIABILITY OF THIRD PERSONS CALLING A PHYSICIAN—GENERAL RULE.\r\n\r\nAs to liability for services rendered, when the medical man is called\r\nby one person to attend another, it may be stated as a general rule\r\nthat in order to create such a liability it must appear that the person\r\ncalling either actually intended to become responsible, or acted in\r\nsuch a manner that the physician was led to suppose that he so intended.\r\n\r\n_Liability of Railway Company Calling Physician in Case of Accident\r\nto Employees, etc._—Another more troublesome question has arisen\r\nwhere physicians and surgeons have been called in by employees of a\r\nrailway company in case of sudden accident or injury. In one case in\r\nNew York, the Superior Court of New York City held, that although the\r\ngeneral superintendent of a railroad company testified that he had\r\ngeneral authority to hire and discharge men, and that he had employed a\r\nphysician, the railroad company was not liable.[169]\r\n\r\n This doctrine seems to be opposed to the weight of authority. See\r\n cases collated in Vol. 18, “Am. and Eng. Cyclopædia of Law,” p. 434\r\n _et seq._, some of which are: Toledo, etc., R. R. Co. _v._ Rodrigues,\r\n 47 Ill., 188; Same _v._ Prince, 50 Ill., 26; Indianapolis, etc., R. R.\r\n _v._ Morris, 67 Ill., 295; Cairo, etc., R. R. Co. _v._ Mahoney, 82\r\n Ill., 73; Atchison, etc., R. R. _v._ Beecher, 24 Kansas, 228.\r\n\r\n _Same Rule does Not Prevail in United States in Case of Accidents to\r\n Passengers._—The cases just noted were all cases of employees. In\r\n the cases of injured passengers it has been doubted whether the same\r\n rule applied, some State courts holding that in that case there is no\r\n obligation to furnish medical and surgical attendance, but that the\r\n physician attending must look to the persons whom they attended. Union\r\n Pacific R. R. Co. _v._ Beatty, 35 Kansas, 265; Brown _v._ Missouri, 67\r\n Missouri, 122.\r\n\r\n _Different in England._—In England a different rule prevails—one\r\n more humane and in consonance with the moral obligation imposed by\r\n the relationship of the parties. In Walker _v._ The Great Western\r\n R. R. Co., a recent case (Law Reports, 2 Exch., 228), Chief-Justice\r\n Kelley, in the course of the argument, made this remark: “Must a board\r\n be convened before a man who has his legs broken can have medical\r\n attendance?”\r\n\r\n But in Cox _v._ The Midland Counties R. R. Co. (3 Wellsby, H. &\r\n G., 268), the station master, employed as the chief officer of the\r\n passenger and other departments, called in a surgeon to perform an\r\n operation upon a passenger injured by a train. The road was held not\r\n liable.\r\n\r\n On the other hand, in Langan _v._ Great Western R. R. Co. (30 Law\r\n Times, N. S., 173), a sub-inspector of railway police was held to have\r\n implied power to employ a surgeon for an injured employee. But in\r\n Arkansas an attorney for a railroad company was held not authorized to\r\n do so. St. Louis, etc., R. R. Co. _v._ Hoover, 53 Ark., 377.\r\n\r\n _Doctrine in Indiana the More Sensible One._—The more sensible\r\n doctrine seems to be established in this country, in the State of\r\n Indiana at least, in the case of Terre Haute R. R. Co. _v._ McMurray\r\n (98 Ind., 358), in which the Court held that where there was great\r\n necessity for the employment of a surgeon, the conductor of a train\r\n has authority to employ the surgeon, if the conductor is the highest\r\n officer in rank on the ground at the time. But in that case the Court\r\n expressly states that this liability grows out of the exigencies of\r\n the case; not out of any theory of general authority.\r\n\r\n _Authority of Railroad Physician to Employ Nurses, etc.,\r\n Doubtful._—It has also been disputed whether the authority of the\r\n company’s physician extended far enough to render the company liable\r\n for services performed by nurses employed by him, or for board and\r\n lodging engaged by him for injured employees. In Bingham _v._ Chicago,\r\n etc., R. R. Co. (79 Iowa, 534), it was held that the authority was\r\n sufficient, but in that case testimony appeared tending to show that\r\n an agent of the company who had authority to employ the physician had\r\n authorized him to employ two nurses. The converse doctrine—namely,\r\n that the fact that a physician of the company was authorized to\r\n buy medicines on the credit of the company does not authorize the\r\n inference that he has power to render the company liable by a contract\r\n for board and nursing of a person injured on the company’s road—was\r\n held in Maber _v._ The Chicago, etc., R. R. Co., 75 Missouri, 495;\r\n Brown _v._ The Missouri R. R., 67 Missouri, 122. To the same effect,\r\n see Louisville, etc., R. R. Co. _v._ McVeigh, 98 Ind., 391; Cooper\r\n _v._ N. Y. C. & C., 6 Hun, 276; and St. Louis, etc., R. R. Co. _v._\r\n Hoover, 53 Arkansas, 377. 2 Redfield on Railways, 114:\r\n\r\n On the other hand, where a physician and surgeon has been duly\r\n employed by a sub-officer or servant of the railroad company,\r\n ratification of this employment, by those having authority to employ\r\n him and to render the company liable, will be inferred from slight\r\n circumstances.\r\n\r\n Such was the case of Louisville R. R. Co. _v._ McVeigh, which has been\r\n cited.\r\n\r\n And in another case where information of the fact of the employment\r\n had been conveyed to the company’s general manager, and he had\r\n neglected and omitted to repudiate the employment or to terminate it,\r\n and the surgeon went on and performed services, it was held that from\r\n these facts a ratification will be inferred. Indianapolis R. R. Co.\r\n _v._ Morris, _supra_. See also Toledo, etc., R. R. Co. _v._ Rodrigues,\r\n _supra_; Same _v._ Prince, _supra_; Terre Haute, etc., R. R. Co. _v._\r\n Stockwell, 118 Ind., 98.\r\n\r\n_Presentation and Retention of Doctor’s Bill Raises No Presumption of\r\nLiability._—The presentation of a bill to a person containing charges\r\nagainst him for services rendered another person, and his retention\r\nof that bill without disclaimer of liability, does not raise a\r\npresumption of liability, for it is not necessarily an account stated.\r\nTo constitute an account stated, there must be not only a statement of\r\naccount, but acquiescence in it; mere retention of the account is not\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n_Bills Presented Not Conclusive as to Amounts Charged._—On the other\r\nhand, if a bill is presented which contains charges which are not\r\nacquiesced in, the person making out and presenting the bill is not\r\nabsolutely bound by the charges therein contained, although such a bill\r\naffords some evidence as to the value of the services rendered.[170]\r\n\r\n_Claims Against Estates of Deceased Persons._—A bill for a physician’s\r\nservices constitutes a claim against the estate of a deceased person,\r\nlike any other debt. In some States it is a preferred claim.[171] In\r\nthis connection it should be observed that short statutes of limitation\r\nexist in most countries and States applicable to such cases, shorter\r\nthan the ordinary limitation imposed by law upon the right to sue upon\r\nclaims for services rendered (which is six years). In order to preserve\r\nhis legal rights, the physician should as soon as possible after the\r\ndeath of the person for whom his services have been rendered, ascertain\r\nwho is the administrator or executor of the estate of such person, and\r\nfile with such representative, personally, proof of his claim.\r\n\r\n_Patient who Receives Benefit of Services of Consulting Physician\r\nLiable._—The liability of a patient for the services of a consulting\r\nphysician is generally governed by the same rules as his liability to\r\nthe physician in immediate charge of the case.[172]\r\n\r\nWhere the patient accepts the services of a consulting physician,\r\nalthough he has not directly requested them, he must pay for them if\r\nhe receives the benefit of them without objecting, because it will be\r\npresumed that he ratified the act of the physician who was in charge of\r\nthe case, in calling the other physician into consultation.[173]\r\n\r\nBut, however this may be, it is a principle of professional ethics,\r\nwhich has almost acquired the authority of legal doctrine, that a\r\nphysician in charge of a case should obtain the full assent of a\r\npatient, or of his family and friends, if he is too ill to give his own\r\nconsent, to the calling of another physician in consultation.\r\n\r\n_No Other Stranger can be Called into Sick-Room without Assent of\r\nPatient._—A limitation upon the authority and right of an attending\r\nphysician is, that if he desires or attempts to call in a stranger not\r\na physician, he must obtain his patient’s consent. The obligation of\r\na physician toward his patient of secrecy and confidence is regarded\r\nas very strict, and if a physician should call in a student or other\r\nstranger, without first consulting his patient, or those who are in\r\nsome measure related to him and connected with him, it would be a very\r\nsevere stretch of morals and possibly of law. In fact, in a recent case\r\nin Michigan, a physician was held liable for damages who called in a\r\nstranger, an unmarried man, who was an unprofessional man, to be with\r\nhim while he was in attendance on a confinement case. In that case both\r\nthe physician and the person so called in, and who was present at that\r\ntime, were held liable in damages; and it was further held that the\r\nright to recover was not affected by the fact that the patient supposed\r\nthat the person so called in was a medical man, and therefore submitted\r\nto his presence without objection.[174]\r\n\r\nThe statutes which create the privilege as to professional\r\ncommunications and information necessary to enable the physician to\r\nprescribe, might not apply to students or other strangers, and this is\r\nprobably the reason for the rule of law laid down in the Michigan case.\r\nThe obligation to preserve inviolate a communication as a privileged\r\ncommunication, including in the meaning of the word “communication”\r\nall knowledge or information received while in attendance upon a case,\r\nwould be held to have been broken by the act of the physician in\r\nbringing in a stranger who would not be privileged from testifying.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURE OF RECOVERY FOR SERVICES RENDERED.\r\n\r\n_Terms of Express Contract Govern—Reasonable Worth the Rule in Implied\r\nContracts._—In case of an express contract its terms necessarily\r\nmeasure the amount of the charges. In the absence of an express\r\ncontract fixing the value of the services to be rendered, the measure\r\nof damages for breach of payment is like that in any other case of\r\npersonal services, the reasonable worth and value of the services\r\nperformed. So likewise if medicines or appliances are furnished, which\r\nare not reasonably to be expected and furnished, according to the\r\ncustom of the school to which the physician or surgeon belongs, the\r\nreasonable worth and value at the time of furnishing them, and at the\r\nplace of furnishing them, is the measure fixed by the law to determine\r\nwhat shall be recovered for them.[175]\r\n\r\n_Value—How Proved._—When the medical man is compelled to go into\r\ncourt to enforce payment for his services, it has been questioned\r\nwhether he can testify to the services rendered, and the facts and\r\ncircumstances surrounding the patient at the time of the treatment,\r\nbecause it has been claimed that he could not do so without violating\r\nthe statute against the disclosure by physicians of information\r\nreceived which is necessary to enable them to prescribe. The tendency\r\nof the later decisions, however, seems to be that the breach of the\r\npatient’s contract to pay relieves the physician from his obligation\r\nof secrecy, and consequently, that if it is necessary for him to go\r\ninto court and prove the value of his services, he may testify, within\r\nreasonable limitations, to all matters necessary to inform the court\r\nfully as to the nature and extent of the disease or injuries of the\r\npatient, in order that he may show the responsibility imposed upon him\r\nand the extent of the services that he has rendered. This subject will\r\nbe fully considered under the head of “Privileged Communications.”\r\nThe usual course of practice where there is not an express contract\r\nfixing the charges, is to prove the facts and circumstances showing the\r\ntreatment and services, and then to produce other physicians who, in\r\nanswer to a hypothetical question stating the facts and circumstances\r\nin the case, assuming them as true, are allowed, if they state they\r\nknow the value of such services, to give an expert opinion as to what\r\nthat value is.[176] It has also been said (Ordronaux, “Jurisprudence\r\nof Medicine,” § 43), that if a fee-bill of charges for such services\r\nhas been established by an association of physicians recognized by\r\nlaw, such as a county medical society or a State medical society,\r\nincorporated pursuant to statute, such fee-bill can, if properly\r\nauthenticated as having been adopted by the association, be offered in\r\nevidence on behalf of the patient and against the physician. But such\r\na fee-bill in such a case would not be held to be conclusive evidence\r\nof the value of the services, but will be received in evidence, if at\r\nall, merely for the purpose of showing what was the usual and ordinary\r\ncharge in such cases. As we shall see later on, under “Malpractice,” a\r\njudgment for services rendered, however small, is a bar to an action of\r\nmalpractice, because a judgment for the value of the services rendered\r\ninvolves proof on the part of the plaintiff, and a finding on the part\r\nof the court, that the services had value and were skilfully performed\r\nand properly rendered.[177]\r\n\r\n_Custom of Physicians to Treat Each Other Gratis,\r\nEnforceable._—Physicians frequently treat each other, and it has been\r\nheld, where the custom exists to do so without charge, that such a\r\ncustom is binding. Of course, this rule does not prevent physicians\r\nfrom making an express contract to waive the custom and agreeing that\r\nthe services be compensated.\r\n\r\n_Elements to be Proved in an Action for Service, etc.—General\r\nAdvice._—The result of these rules may be thus summarized, viz.: The\r\nelements to be established in an action for services by a physician\r\nagainst a patient are three in number—(1) the employment; (2) the\r\nperformance of the services;[178] and (3) the value of the services,\r\nthat value being either a fixed value determined by the terms of the\r\ncontract between the parties, or the reasonable worth and value of the\r\nservices determined by evidence of experts upon that subject. It is,\r\ntherefore, important that physicians and surgeons should be advised,\r\nwhen entering upon the practice of their profession, to keep a record\r\nof their transactions and of their business generally. Because, if they\r\nare compelled to go into court to recover for their services, they will\r\nbe called upon to describe with minuteness the character and extent\r\nof the services they have performed in order that the value thereof\r\nmay be correctly ascertained and determined in the suit. Any person in\r\nactive practice who is not blessed with a most tenacious and particular\r\nmemory is liable to forget a great many details which, with a record in\r\nhand, properly kept, could be brought to his memory and be testified to\r\nwith absolute truthfulness and conviction. And the record itself, when\r\nproperly shown to be a book of original entry, is generally receivable\r\nin evidence, as a memorandum of the transaction.[179]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n OF THE PRIVILEGES AND DUTIES OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS WHEN SUMMONED\r\n AS EXPERT WITNESSES IN COURTS OF JUSTICE.[180]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introductory—Distinction Between Expert Witnesses and Other\r\nWitnesses._—One of the most important positions that a medical man\r\nis called upon to assume by virtue of his professional character, is\r\nthe position of expert witness. Most writers on medical jurisprudence\r\nconfine themselves, in the discussion of this subject, to presenting\r\nthe medico-legal rules which appertain to this position, and concede\r\nits high importance. Before defining what is meant by the term expert\r\nwitness, or treating of the rules which determine the status of such\r\nwitnesses in court, and their duties, it seems advisable to introduce\r\nthe subject by a brief consideration of the distinction between\r\nordinary witnesses and expert witnesses. When medicine and law are\r\nunited in the purpose of investigating facts, and bringing about a\r\nlegal determination as to what are or are not facts, they co-operate\r\nwith each other in this way. The law furnishes the machinery for the\r\ninquiry and the rules which determine how it shall be prosecuted.\r\nThe medical man, however, is called upon as an assistant to the law,\r\nbecause of his skill and experience in his profession, which enable\r\nhim to ascertain and interpret the circumstances from which the facts\r\nsought to be established are to be inferred. Ordinary witnesses testify\r\nconcerning matters of observation, the court and jury being endowed\r\nwith the sole power to determine the credibility of their evidence\r\nand the true result of their observations. Yet the border line of\r\ndistinction between witnesses who testify merely to actual matters\r\nof observation, and those who give their opinions upon and draw\r\ninferences from established facts and circumstances, is a wavering\r\none. The general rule of evidence is well understood, that hearsay\r\nevidence is inadmissible, and yet, like any other rule, this has its\r\nexceptions which grow out of the necessities of given cases. This is\r\nso because there are and always will be, matters brought before courts\r\nfor investigation and determination, long after the witnesses who\r\npersonally saw the facts and circumstances of the particular case in\r\nwhich such matters are concerned have died, or have withdrawn beyond\r\nthe reach of the process of the court. Possibly no record in writing\r\nof such facts and circumstances has been left, or if in writing it\r\nlacks the sanctity of being a judicial writing, and hence is no better\r\nevidence than any other form of hearsay evidence. For this reason in\r\nmatters of family history, pedigree, custom, and the like, hearsay\r\nevidence is permitted, and is entitled to as much weight as any other\r\nevidence, if the witnesses giving it be trustworthy.\r\n\r\n_In Matters of Common Experience Witnesses in General Often State\r\nConclusions._—Moreover, in matters of common experience, the testimony\r\nof any witness, if carefully analyzed, often shows that he is sometimes\r\nallowed to draw, and state, his conclusions and inferences, instead\r\nof being required to confine his evidence simply to telling in the\r\nstrictest possible way, and with the closest limitations, what he\r\nactually witnessed. A good illustration of this is the case of a\r\nperson who sees a crime of homicide committed by shooting, and is\r\ncalled upon to testify in court. He would be allowed to testify that\r\nthe defendant, if he could identify the prisoner at the bar as such,\r\nwas the person whom he saw fire the shot, although he might not have\r\nexamined him with close scrutiny, and might never have seen him before\r\nthe crime. In saying that the defendant was the person who fired\r\nthe shot, while he would be in terms testifying to a fact, he would\r\nstill be drawing an inference, and giving an opinion, based upon his\r\nrecollection of the person whom he saw engaged in the act of firing,\r\nand of the likeness or resemblance of such person to the prisoner at\r\nthe bar, which would be a matter of comparison and of opinion. So, too,\r\nalthough he could not see the bullet take its course from the mouth\r\nof the gun and imbed itself in the body of the deceased, yet if he\r\nsaw the firing, heard the explosion, saw the flash and smoke of the\r\npowder, observed the direction in which the accused pointed the weapon,\r\nand saw the deceased stagger and fall, he would be allowed to testify\r\nin answer to a direct question whether or not the accused shot the\r\ndeceased. And, yet in making up that answer he would be testifying not\r\nsimply to a matter of actual observation, but to a conclusion. As it\r\nis in reference to the question of identity so it is as to many other\r\nmatters which come before our courts, in all of which the witnesses are\r\npermitted, without objection, to testify to conclusions and to give\r\nanswers which are the result of inferences which they draw themselves,\r\nrather than a statement of their actual observations. The law is not\r\na metaphysical but a practical science, limited and confined by the\r\npractical restrictions which experience has shown must be put upon\r\nit, in order to enable it to accomplish its object of administering\r\njustice between man and man. Men form such conclusions as have been\r\nindicated, instinctively and unconsciously, and it would be practicably\r\nimpossible for them to narrate any occurrence without embodying in\r\ntheir narration some of these natural and unconscious conclusions.\r\nThe law, therefore, includes among the matters which witnesses are\r\npermitted to characterize as facts, those daily and hourly inferences\r\nand deductions which all men are accustomed to make, and concerning\r\nwhich no two men who are properly constituted can greatly differ.\r\nIt is true that this practice sometimes leads to error, but it has\r\ngrown out of necessity. The greatest safeguard is, that upon the\r\ntrial of a question of fact both sides are represented by counsel,\r\nand the opportunity which cross-examination offers to an advocate of\r\neven reasonable and ordinary skill is such, that these conclusions\r\nand inferences may be sifted down through the chain of observation,\r\nand the process of drawing these conclusions and inferences from a\r\nseries of facts, tested in such a manner that the improbability,\r\nprobability, or truth of any given inference or conclusion may be\r\ndetermined with substantial accuracy. The illustrations which have\r\nbeen given above exhibit the simplest form in which so-called direct\r\ntestimony can be demonstrated to be not always positive and direct\r\ntestimony, but somewhat a matter of inference. Other examples and\r\nillustrations of common occurrence will exhibit still more closely the\r\nline between actuality and opinion. At times it becomes essential to\r\nthe determination of a question, that the courts should know whether or\r\nnot a person was angry, whether or not he was intoxicated, or whether\r\nor not at a given time, when his mental status was under observation,\r\nhe acted rationally or irrationally. Lay witnesses have for many years\r\nbeen permitted to testify from observation, and without possessing any\r\nspecial qualification to do so, as to the existence or non-existence of\r\nsuch conditions as those just mentioned in a person whose actions are\r\nunder consideration. It is manifest that in making any such inferences\r\nthe witnesses’ testimony is mainly a conclusion based on inference.\r\nTake the case of anger. How shall that be determined? It is difficult\r\nto describe anger. A loud voice, a flushed face, the use of bitter\r\nwords, nervous, excitable, demonstrative action—all these symptoms\r\nmight occur, or but few of them might occur. So, too, in the matter\r\nof intoxication. It is well known that some individuals exhibit the\r\neffects of intoxicants in an entirely different manner and degree from\r\nothers. Some men who are very much intoxicated, so as to be quite\r\nincapable, in the eye of the law, of forming a criminal intent, or of\r\ncontracting an obligation which would be valid, may still be able to\r\nwalk perfectly straight, or to talk without much confusion. Others,\r\nwhose walk and demeanor would indicate a considerable degree of\r\nintoxication, might be mentally clear and unruffled and even stimulated\r\nby intoxicants to precise mental co-ordination and reasoning. Again,\r\nthere are persons, as to whom a witness, after stating that he had\r\nobserved them, and after stating the particular matters and things in\r\nwhich such persons were engaged, might with apparent accuracy state\r\nthat they acted rationally or irrationally, and yet such persons might\r\nnevertheless, upon further examination, be found to have been acting\r\naccording to a particular custom or habit, or idiosyncrasy of long\r\nyears’ standing. Thus it is apparent that in each of these cases,\r\nwhen the witness attempts to state what, out of necessity, the court\r\ntreats as a fact—viz., whether a given person is or is not angry,\r\nor intoxicated, or irrational—the witness is really testifying to\r\nthe result, in his own mind, of his observations of the condition\r\nand conduct of the person who is under investigation, when compared\r\nwith a standard which the witness has erected for himself. Hence such\r\nresults are really matters of opinion evidence, pure and simple. Other\r\nexamples of a like character are found in statements as to weight,\r\nheight, distance, speed, and the like, as to which men of common\r\npowers of observation, who are not strictly experts, are, because\r\nof convenience and necessity and the probability of reasonable and\r\nordinary accuracy, commonly permitted to give their own judgment and\r\nconclusions as evidence.\r\n\r\n_All Witnesses Often Permitted to Draw and State Conclusions in Matters\r\ninvolving Numerous and Complicated Details._—Thus the practical\r\nnecessity of the administration of justice has led to the establishment\r\nof the rule, that where the details of an occurrence are numerous and\r\ncomplicated, and are incapable of precise description by ordinary\r\nobservers, witnesses are permitted to use, in testifying, general\r\nexpressions which really embody their conclusions from the facts or\r\ndetails observed by them. Greenleaf on Evidence, Section 440, note A;\r\nWharton on Evidence, Section 434.\r\n\r\nWharton says that “the distinction between expert witnesses and\r\nordinary witnesses is this: the non-expert witness testifies to\r\nconclusions which may be verified by the adjudicating tribunal; the\r\nexpert, to conclusions which cannot be so verified. The non-expert\r\ngives the results of a process of reasoning familiar to every-day life;\r\nthe expert gives the results of a process of reasoning which can be\r\ndetermined only by special scientists.” See also People _v._ Fernandez,\r\n35 N.Y., 49. People _v._ Deacons, 109 N.Y., 374-382.\r\n\r\nThis learned writer (Wharton) also says, at Section 437 of the same\r\ntreatise:\r\n\r\n“Where conclusions depend upon facts whose evidential weight can only\r\nbe determined by those familiar with a particular specialty, then these\r\nconclusions may be given by experts in such specialty.” Such also is\r\nthe exact derivative meaning of the word expert, it being derived from\r\nthe Latin word “_expertus_,” meaning, literally, “experienced,” and\r\nhence skilled by experience.\r\n\r\n_Functions of an Expert Witness Essentially Judicial._—It is the\r\nfunction of an expert witness to reason about facts, to explain their\r\nconnection with one another, and to draw conclusions and inferences\r\nfrom them. Hence, a witness, however expert in any ordinary sense in\r\nhis specialty, when he is called upon merely to narrate facts which he\r\nhas observed, is an ordinary witness, and is governed by the same rules\r\nwhich apply to the ordinary witnesses. When, however, he is called\r\nupon, in addition to recounting facts, to explain or interpret them by\r\nreference to assumed facts, he becomes properly an expert witness. It\r\nthus appears that an expert witness must necessarily perform a part\r\nof the duties which devolve upon the court or the jury. His position\r\nis, therefore, essentially judicial, except that he has no power to\r\nenforce his determinations by judicial process. The importance and\r\nresponsibility which the law thus confers upon an expert are of the\r\nhighest character. He ranks the coequal with the tribunal itself in his\r\npeculiar province, so far as relates to his individual responsibility.\r\nThat this should tend to elevate such witnesses to a high social\r\nposition, and ought to require the most exact and faithful integrity of\r\npurpose and statement, is self-evident.\r\n\r\n_Difference Between Status of Expert Witnesses in France and Germany\r\nand in the United States and England._—In some foreign countries,\r\nnotably in Germany and in France, experts in medico-legal matters have\r\nan assured official position, and are generally not allowed to be\r\nselected at hap-hazard according to the will or the length of the purse\r\nof those who need their services. The consequence of this method of\r\nobtaining expert evidence is, that expert witnesses in those countries\r\ncommand a high measure of respect and honor.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, in this country, where the opposite practice\r\nprevails, the weaknesses of human nature are such that the common\r\npeople, newspapers, lawyers, and even the courts in some recorded\r\nopinions and decisions, have come to express a great want of confidence\r\nin the weight and value of expert testimony. This deplorable result\r\nof a bad system of procedure is universally recognized, yet our State\r\nlegislatures have as yet refrained from attempting to correct it.\r\n\r\nHence, in considering the value of expert testimony _in matters of\r\nmedical jurisprudence_, it must be conceded, in the first instance,\r\nthat the difference between the system prevailing in this country\r\nand in England, and that which prevails on the Continent, notably in\r\nGermany and France, has not tended to raise but to depress the value of\r\nsuch testimony in the first-named countries. In the latter countries,\r\nthe experts upon medico-legal questions are officers of the court,\r\nor are treated as such. They form, in a sense, a part of the judicial\r\nsystem, and the expression of their opinions consequently carries with\r\nit great weight. Moreover, under the system which prevails there,\r\nit has been possible for men to be educated up to a high degree of\r\nskill and experience in the particular branches of physiological or\r\npsychological or physical investigations which they pursue, while here\r\nin America, and to a certain extent also in England, experts are such\r\nfor other reasons, and by the operations of other causes, than the fact\r\nof their permanent employment in that capacity. As a general thing they\r\nbecome skilled in their profession or in the particular branches of\r\nit in which they practise as specialists, and are summoned to testify\r\nsimply because they are selected by one party or another to a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Wharton’s View of this Question in the Main Hostile to the\r\nPrevailing System Here._—The effect of the methods which thus prevail\r\nhas not been entirely to the advantage of the medical profession or of\r\nour courts. Wharton, in his work on “Evidence,” Section 454, observes\r\nupon this point: “When expert testimony was first introduced it was\r\nregarded with great respect. An expert was viewed as the representative\r\nof a science of which he was a professor, giving impartially its\r\nconclusions. Two conditions have combined to produce a material change\r\nin this relation. In the first place it has been discovered that no\r\nexpert, no matter how learned and incorrupt, speaks for his science as\r\na whole. Few specialties are so small as not to be torn by factions,\r\nand often the smaller the specialty the bitterer and more inflaming and\r\ndistorting are the animosities by which these factions are possessed.\r\nParticularly is this the case in matters psychological, in which there\r\nis no hypothesis so monstrous that an expert cannot be found to swear\r\nto it on the stand, and to defend it with vehemence. ‘_Nihil tam\r\nabsurdo_,’ which being literally translated means that there is nothing\r\nso absurd that the philosophers won’t say it! In the second place,\r\nthe retaining of experts by a fee proportioned to the importance of\r\ntheir testimony is now as customary as is the retaining of lawyers. No\r\ncourt would take as testimony the sworn statement of the law given by\r\ncounsel retained on a particular side, for the reason that the most\r\nhigh-minded men are so swayed by an employment of this kind as to lose\r\nthe power of impartial judgment; and so intense is this conviction that\r\nin every civilized community the retention by a judge of presents from\r\nsuitors visits him not only with disqualification but disgrace. Hence\r\nit is that, apart from the partisan character of their opinions, their\r\nutterances, now that they have as a class become the retained agents\r\nof the parties, have lost all judicial authority and are entitled only\r\nto the weight which sound and consistent criticism will award to the\r\ntestimony itself. In making this criticism a large allowance must be\r\nmade for the bias necessarily belonging to men retained to advocate\r\na cause, who speak not as to fact but as to opinion, and who are\r\nselected, on all moot questions, either from their prior advocacy of\r\nthem or from their readiness to adopt the opinion to be proved. In this\r\nsense we may adopt the strong language of Lord Kenyon, that skilled\r\nwitnesses come with such a bias on their minds to support the cause\r\nin which they are embarked, that hardly any weight should be given to\r\ntheir evidence.”\r\n\r\nThis author then proceeds to show that under the civil law system the\r\nconclusions of experts were formerly treated as unassailable facts,\r\nbut under the English and American common law system this is not the\r\ncase, but their testimony is to be weighed by the court. He says:\r\n“The grounds on which the conclusion is reached may be asked for: the\r\nexpert’s capacity for drawing conclusions, as well as his premises,\r\nmay be assailed. Cases of conflict are to be determined, not by the\r\nnumber of witnesses, but by the weight of their testimony, and though\r\nthe opinion of an expert of high character may be entitled to great\r\nrespect, yet if questioned, its authority must ultimately rest upon the\r\ntruth, material and formal, of the reasoning on which it depends.”\r\n\r\nJudge Davis, of the Supreme Court of Maine, in Neil’s case (cited\r\nin Wharton and Stille’s “Medical Jurisprudence,” Vol. I., Section\r\n294), said: “If there is any kind of testimony that is not only of no\r\nvalue, but even worse than that, it is in my judgment that of medical\r\nexperts. They may be able to state the diagnosis of a disease more\r\nlearnedly, but upon the question whether it had at a given time reached\r\na stage that the subject of it was incapable of making a contract, or\r\nirresponsible for his acts, the opinions of his neighbors, of men of\r\ngood common sense, would be worth more than that of all the experts in\r\nthe country.”\r\n\r\nSuch stinging criticisms as these, and others which might be cited,\r\nof a like character, may not be always merited. It is certain that\r\nmedical experts’ opinions, if fully enlightened by scientific research\r\nand free from partisan bias, ought to occupy a position like that\r\nof judicial opinions in weight and decisiveness upon the questions\r\nsubmitted to them. Such was the position occupied in the public\r\nestimation, and in that of judges and counsel, by the great Dr. Caspar\r\nin Germany, and Foedere or Pinel, and others since their time, in\r\nFrance. But this position was acquired chiefly because of the fact\r\nalready mentioned, that under the system of administration of justice\r\nwhich prevails in those countries these great men were regarded, and\r\nacted, as a component part of the judicial system. They were called\r\nin as officers of the law to assist the court in forming a judgment,\r\nand determining disputed questions of fact, in cases involving life\r\nand death, or the devolution of property, where scientific experience,\r\nknowledge and skill, not possessed by judges or by counsel, was\r\nnecessary for the determination of the questions involved. The root\r\nof the evil in America is, as already pointed out, to be found in\r\nthe system which allows parties to retain and pay their own experts\r\nwithout any substantial restrictions. Sooner or later, among the other\r\nreforms in our judicial system, it will be found necessary to reform\r\nthis evil by the enactment of laws requiring that the witnesses in\r\nmedico-legal cases, particularly those in which a crime is alleged\r\nto have been committed, shall be designated by the court, or by some\r\npublic authority, and paid from the public treasury instead of by\r\nthe parties. Such experts would then occupy their proper position of\r\nspecial counsel, advising and assisting the legal counsel and the\r\ncourt, but they would not be taken out of this sphere and put in the\r\nutterly inconsistent one of witnesses. Their status and their duties\r\nwould be as clearly distinguished from that of expert witnesses as now\r\nknown, as the status and duty of the lawyer are from the status and\r\nduty of the judge. The present system has been said to be very much\r\nlike putting a lawyer, who has just argued his client’s case, on the\r\nbench to decide it. Whether experts should be appointed as permanent\r\ngovernment officials, like our judges, or should be selected specially\r\nfor each case like juries, referees, or arbitrators, and in the latter\r\nevent whether they should be nominated by the parties and selected by\r\nthe court from such nominees, or otherwise, are all questions of detail.\r\n\r\nOur judges and lawyers seem slow to recognize the fact that the duties\r\nof experts are judicial, or at least quasi-judicial; to pass upon\r\ncertain facts which neither the court nor the jury can understand\r\nwithout their aid. But, as we have seen from the citations just given,\r\njudges and lawyers have fully recognized the unreliability of expert\r\ntestimony, produced as it now is in England and in this country at\r\nthe whim and selection of the parties and paid for, much or little,\r\naccording to the means of the parties.[181]\r\n\r\n_Method of Preliminary Examination of Experts—On Medical Questions a\r\nLicensed Physician Presumed Competent._—As the system exists here, the\r\nonly power that the court has over the selection of an expert, is to\r\ndetermine, in advance of his testimony and of the elucidation of his\r\nopinions, whether or not he is competent as an expert. But this power\r\naffords little or no check or restriction, because in the effort to get\r\nall the light that is possible upon the questions under consideration,\r\nand to avoid unduly interfering with counsel in the conduct of the\r\ncase at bar, the practice has become universal, and is recognized in\r\nthe decisions and text writers, of permitting any medical man who has\r\na license to practise his profession, to testify as an expert, and to\r\ngive his opinion as such on any question cognate to his profession.\r\nThis is so without regard to the amount of study and experience he\r\nmay have had in the particular matter under consideration. The naked\r\nfact that he is licensed to practise is enough. He then—that is,\r\nafter testifying that he is a practising physician—is clothed with\r\nthe garment of authority. The only way in which his knowledge can be\r\ntested is by cross-examination as to his experience and skill, and\r\npossibly by contrasting him as he appears upon the witness-stand and\r\nhis history as he gives it, with other and more or less experienced and\r\nskilful men who follow him.\r\n\r\nThe rule is, that when a witness is produced to give an opinion on a\r\nmedical question, he is interrogated by the counsel who produces him\r\nas to his qualifications. At this point, before he is allowed to give\r\nhis opinion, it is proper and customary that the counsel upon the other\r\nside of the case should be allowed an opportunity to cross-examine\r\nas to his competency, and then the court determines whether or not\r\nhe is a competent witness. If the court pronounces him competent, a\r\nhypothetical question is put to him stating the facts of the case, as\r\nthe counsel interrogating him claims them to be established by the\r\nevidence, and the expert is then asked to give his opinion on the\r\nquestion at issue, based upon an assumption that the facts stated are\r\ntruly stated. Then the opposing counsel has the right to cross-examine,\r\nand to ask his views and opinions upon the same question at issue, but\r\nassuming as true other and different facts or premises, as he claims\r\nthem to be established by the evidence. This often involves a test of\r\nwit and intelligence, and of forensic acumen, between the counsel and\r\nthe witness, which serves very little useful purpose, except perhaps to\r\nelucidate more strongly than has been here stated the defects of the\r\nsystem which now obtains. It is also not unusual, and in fact is the\r\nresult of the workings of human nature, that under the manipulations of\r\ncounsel skilled in cross-examination, skilled in methods of indirection\r\nin stating facts, and armed with the powerful weapon of the rule\r\nwhich permits them to insist upon a categorical yes-or-no answer to a\r\nquestion, the jury and the court become confused, the witness loses\r\nhis temper, or becomes affected more strongly than ever before by bias\r\nagainst his persecutors, as he feels them to be, and the examination\r\nends in a farce. This is not always the case, and the illustration\r\ngiven is an extreme one. Like the citations from judicial criticism of\r\nexpert testimony which have been given, these matters are only adverted\r\nto here as danger signals, a warning to both professions, and with an\r\nearnest suggestion of the necessity of reform.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERTS, HOW SUMMONED INTO COURT.\r\n\r\n_They Must Obey the Summons and Appear and be Sworn. In General they\r\nneed Not Give their Opinions unless Duly Compensated._—An expert\r\nwitness is brought into court like an ordinary witness by the usual\r\nprocess of the court. This process is, under the American system, an\r\nordinary subpœna, and, being process of the court, whether or not he\r\nhas been paid or promised compensation for giving his opinion he must\r\nobey the process to the extent at least of appearing in court when\r\ncalled, to be sworn. Interesting questions have been raised as to his\r\nobedience to the subpœna to the extent of testifying when he has not\r\nbeen compensated. It has been argued, and the argument is sustained\r\nby the decisions of courts of high authority in some States, that\r\nhis knowledge and skill, acquired by study and by experience, is his\r\nproperty, of which he cannot be deprived without just compensation,\r\nunder his constitutional rights guaranteed to him by the organic law\r\nof this country. On the other hand, in some other States it has been\r\nheld that he is so far a necessary part of the judicial system that he\r\nmay be called upon to give the results of his experience, knowledge,\r\nand skill forming his opinion, without payment other than the ordinary\r\ncompensation to witnesses. It is believed, however, that the better\r\nopinion is the former; that he does not stand on the same footing as\r\nan ordinary witness, whose province it is to testify solely to matters\r\nof observation of fact, but that he stands in the position of one who\r\nhas something to give; something to impart in the way of knowledge or\r\nexperience, which is his property as much as any other thing movable or\r\nimmovable of which he is possessed.\r\n\r\nA somewhat different question has arisen in the case of a witness who,\r\nlike a family physician or attending physician, has learned facts\r\nand has been paid for his attendance, or who exacts payment for his\r\nattendance, as a physician from his patient, and this question is;\r\nwhen such a professional man has been called upon to testify to the\r\ninformation he thus attained, whether he can be asked for, and required\r\nto give, opinions based on those facts? Necessarily, having learned the\r\nfacts by observation, such as the appearance, symptoms, and actions of\r\nthe patient, he is, when testifying as to these matters, nothing more\r\nor less than an ordinary witness, because he is testifying to matters\r\nof observation. As to these matters public policy requires, except so\r\nfar as it has been modified, or rather extended, by our statutes which\r\nforbid testimony as to privileged communications, that he must testify,\r\nthe same as any other witness. But suppose that, having so testified to\r\nthe facts, he is asked to give his opinion; for example, in an insanity\r\ncase, whether the symptoms that he found in his patient led him to the\r\nbelief as a professional man of experience and skill that his patient\r\nwas sane or insane. The question is, Can he be compelled to give that\r\nopinion, if he chooses to decline to give it without the promise or\r\nassurance of further compensation than the mere _per diem_ fee and\r\nmileage of an ordinary witness? The best authority is to the effect\r\nthat he must so testify, the reasoning of the court being that his\r\nopinion is only a part of what he derived from his original relation of\r\nphysician to his patient. Wright _v._ The People, 112 Ill., 540; same\r\ncase, 33 Alb. L. J., 79.\r\n\r\n_Same Rule in Civil and Criminal Cases._—The rule is the same whether\r\nthe professional man is called to testify as an expert in civil or\r\ncriminal cases. In either one he is not obliged to give an opinion as\r\nsuch, independent of a personal knowledge of the facts in the case,\r\nwithout being paid or assured reasonable compensation therefor. His\r\nproper course of conduct is, when he has obeyed the subpœna and is in\r\nthe presence of the court and has been sworn, and the questions put\r\nby counsel disclose that the object of his examination is to elicit\r\nfrom him an opinion, to state to the court that he has not been paid\r\nany other compensation than that of an ordinary witness, and that he\r\nrespectfully declines to give an opinion in the case as an expert,\r\nwithout compensation proportionate to the value of his opinion.[182]\r\n\r\n_Whether Witness Competent a Question for Court in Limine._—After\r\nthe expert is placed upon the stand, as we have seen, the counsel\r\nupon the side of the case by which he is summoned interrogates him\r\nas to his capacity, the purpose of the interrogation being that his\r\nanswers shall qualify him and show him to be an expert. Whether or\r\nnot he is an expert so as to permit the giving of his opinion as\r\npart of the case to go to the jury, is for the court to decide _in\r\nlimine_, that is, at the threshold, and as a matter of discretion, and\r\nthe exercise of that discretion, if fair and reasonable, will not be\r\ndisturbed upon appeal by the higher court. It is permissible, but also\r\ndiscretionary, after the counsel calls the witness and has apparently\r\nqualified him, for the counsel upon the other side to cross-examine\r\nthe witness as to his qualifications before he is examined in chief,\r\nwith a view of determining whether or not there are limitations upon\r\nthose qualifications which should prevent the court from permitting him\r\nto testify as an expert. The general rule is as stated by Greenleaf\r\nin his work on Evidence, Sec. 440, that it is not necessary that the\r\nmedical expert should have actually practised his profession. Nor is it\r\nessential that the witness should belong to any particular school of\r\nmedicine. The law does not undertake to pass upon conflicting theories\r\nof medical practice, in determining the question of the qualification\r\nof a medical expert. It is proper, however, for counsel to inquire as\r\nto what school of medicine the witness is an adherent, because of its\r\nimportance in weighing the value of his testimony after it has been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n_Persons Not Duly Licensed Sometimes Held Not Competent._—It has\r\nalso been a mooted question in those States where it is necessary, in\r\norder to enable a person to practise physic or surgery, that he should\r\nbe licensed, whether a person practising without a license, however\r\nextensive his reading and practice, would be considered qualified as\r\nan expert witness in a court of justice. This point, so far as diligent\r\nexamination discloses, has not been determined in any reported case,\r\nalthough it has been suggested at _nisi prius_ and has been, in one\r\ninstance within the knowledge of the writer, decided that he is not\r\nto be considered an expert in matters involving medical knowledge and\r\nskill. The reasoning of the court was that the policy of the State\r\nis to prohibit persons not possessing the qualifications required\r\nto obtain a license, from acting in any capacity as professors and\r\npractitioners of medicine or surgery. If the witness is a member of\r\nthe profession, legally qualified as such, it has been held that he is\r\nsufficiently qualified as an expert if he shows that he possesses the\r\naverage ability of members of his profession. Hall _v._ Costello, 48\r\nN. H., 176; Tellis _v._ Kidd, 12 Ala., 648; Wharton on Evidence, Sec.\r\n446; Rogers on Expert Testimony, Secs. 17 and 18; Slocovich _v._ Orient\r\nMutual Ins. Co., 108 N. Y., 56.\r\n\r\nAs to the question whether it is necessary that the witness should\r\nactually have practised his profession, see the last-cited text-writer,\r\nSecs. 43 and 44, who seems to have entertained views opposite to those\r\nstated by Professor Greenleaf.\r\n\r\nWharton on Evidence, Sec. 439, states the rule as follows: “He must\r\nhave special, practical acquaintance with the immediate line of inquiry\r\nmore than a mere vague, superficial knowledge. But he need not be\r\nacquainted with the _differentia_ of the specific specialty under\r\nconsideration.... A general knowledge of the department to which the\r\nspecialty belongs would seem to be sufficient.”\r\n\r\n_Interested Persons may still Testify as Experts._—Since the law\r\nforbidding interested persons from being witnesses has been changed,\r\nit has been suggested that an interested person although otherwise\r\nqualified might not be a competent witness to give an opinion as an\r\nexpert. But the established doctrine is that he may give such an\r\nopinion; the weight of it, however, would be for the jury to determine.\r\nGreenleaf on Evidence, Redfield’s edition, Sec. 440, citing Lockwood\r\n_v._ Lockwood, 2 Curtis, 309; Dillon _v._ Dillon, 3 Curtis, 96, 102.\r\nSee also Dickinson _v._ Fitchburg, 13 Gray, 546.\r\n\r\n_Testimony of Expert, how Impeached._—Sometimes, on cross-examination\r\nor otherwise, the fact becomes known that the witness who is proposed\r\nas an expert has expressed an opinion on the subject in hand contrary\r\nto that which he has given upon the witness-stand, and the question has\r\nbeen raised as to establishing that fact at the outset and before his\r\ntestimony goes before the jury, in order to enable the trial judge to\r\ndetermine whether he is competent. The rule in that case is that the\r\ntestimony as to his prior expression of opinion is not to be received\r\nat that time, but will come properly up as rebuttal, he having been\r\nasked upon his cross-examination, giving time and place, whether he\r\nhas made the statements attributed to him. An expert witness may in\r\nother respects be impeached like any other witness, that is, by the\r\noaths of persons who know him and have known his reputation, and who\r\ntestify that his reputation for truth and veracity is bad and that they\r\nwould not believe him under oath. He may also be impeached by producing\r\nwitnesses to prove that his special knowledge or technical skill is\r\nnot reliable or adequate to the undertaking which he has assumed. But\r\nthis testimony must be from personal knowledge of the man and not\r\nfrom general reputation. Wharton on Evidence, Sec. 437; Le Rose _v._\r\nCommonwealth, 84 Pa. St., 200.[183]\r\n\r\n_General Rule as to Required Amount of Skill and Experience\r\nStated._—The general rule may be stated thus, as derived from these\r\nand other authorities:\r\n\r\nThe extent of the previous study and investigation, and the amount of\r\nskill and information which must be shown, will depend upon the facts\r\nof each particular case. But some special and peculiar knowledge or\r\nskill must be established, the amount of it to be determined by the\r\ntrial judge in his discretion. The possession of such knowledge and\r\nskill is presumed in medico-legal cases if the witness is a licensed\r\npractitioner.\r\n\r\n_Some Practical Suggestions as to Conduct of Witnesses on the\r\nStand._—In this preliminary examination, the conduct and demeanor\r\nof the witness are of no little importance, because it is then and\r\nthere that he makes his first impression upon the court and jury.\r\nHe should be perfectly open and unreserved in stating his means of\r\nspecial information, in explaining what are the limits of his personal\r\nexperience and the extent of his reading; but, at the same time, it\r\nwould be well for him to avoid all appearance of self-glorification\r\nand all tendency to exaggerate his individual acquirements. Often has\r\nit occurred that expert witnesses of undoubted capacity and honesty,\r\nwho are unfortunately grandiose and self-assertive in their manner,\r\nhave, however honest and able they might be, lost entirely their weight\r\nwith the court and jury by undue self-complacency and exaggeration of\r\ntheir personal qualifications, during their preliminary examination.\r\nThis is a matter requiring tact and judgment and nerve, and should be\r\nfully understood between counsel calling him and the witness, before\r\nthe witness is placed upon the stand. In that event, it will be quite\r\nsafe for the witness to closely follow the questions of counsel by his\r\nanswers, and to volunteer little or nothing. If his answers are not\r\nfull and complete enough, counsel can renew the question in the same or\r\nin other form or carry the matter into greater detail. If, on the other\r\nhand, his answer is too full or he appears too eager, he may create\r\na prejudice against him which nothing can overthrow, and which the\r\nart of counsel upon the other side in cross-examination and in making\r\ncomments upon his testimony when summing up before the jury, will very\r\neffectually use to destroy his weight as an expert.[184]\r\n\r\n_Scope and Extent of Examination of Expert Witnesses._—Having stated\r\nhow experts may be summoned and qualified, it remains to consider the\r\nscope and extent to which they may be examined.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of the sciences and the progress of research in special\r\nfields of knowledge have made expert testimony of large importance\r\nduring the present century. The basis of its admission is the fact\r\nthat there are certain processes of reasoning which an ordinary jury\r\nis incapable of performing, even with the assistance of courts and\r\nlawyers. Oftentimes in the administration of justice in our courts,\r\nproof is given of circumstances which although admitted would have\r\nlittle or no significance in the mind of an ordinary juror, and\r\nwhich he would be unable to contrast and compare with other facts,\r\nsuccessfully, without the aid of those more familiar with scientific\r\nmatters and the inductive process of reasoning than he is. In such\r\ncases it is necessary that the jury should be specially enlightened\r\nby persons who have, through training, skill and experience, acquired\r\nthe power to enlighten them. A common instance and illustration of\r\nthis matter is to be found in the case of homicide by poisoning. A\r\nhuman body is found dead; externally there may be no _indicia_ to\r\nshow positively the cause of death. Under such circumstances the\r\nlaws of all civilized countries permit what is called a post-mortem\r\nexamination by skilled physicians, who, finding no external evidences\r\nof the cause of death, are permitted by the officers of the law to\r\nremove the internal portions of the body for special and careful\r\nexamination. If this discloses traces of inflammation or of lesions of\r\nan abnormal character, further power is vested in the authorities to\r\nhave at the expense of the State a chemical examination of the internal\r\norgans. If this examination, which is necessarily long and excessively\r\ntechnical, results in the discovery of any poisonous substance, such\r\nas would produce death, and if it is found in sufficient quantities to\r\nproduce death, these persons who made the post-mortem examination and\r\ndiscovered the outward indications of the administration and effects\r\nof the poison, and the chemists who discovered the poison itself in\r\nthe tissues of the body, in sufficient quantities to produce death,\r\nare called as experts before the jury. The post-mortem examiners\r\nexplain what the appearance of the body was, as distinguished from the\r\nappearances of the body of an individual who had died from natural\r\ncauses. The chemist describes his course of experimentation, the\r\nvarious deductions which he made from his experiments, the tests which\r\nhe applied in his investigation in discovering poison, and is then\r\nallowed to testify that the poisonous substance was found in sufficient\r\nquantities to produce the physical appearances which the post-mortem\r\nexaminers have described, and to accomplish the death of the human\r\nbeing in whose body the poison was found. It is obvious that the power\r\nof observation and the skill, which the skilled chemists and physicians\r\nused as the basis of their reasoning in this case, were such as an\r\nordinary man, unskilled and inexperienced, would not possess, and the\r\nability to use them must have come from the study of treatises on\r\nsuch subjects, and from teaching and experience, to such an extent as\r\nto entitle the persons so testifying to be considered by the courts\r\nas qualified to express an accurate and sound opinion on the matters\r\nand things under investigation. Thus it appears how, in such cases, a\r\ndeparture became essential to the successful administration of justice,\r\nfrom the strict rule that witnesses shall testify solely to matters of\r\nfact and observation, and why it has long been considered that some\r\nwitnesses must be allowed to testify to opinions and conclusions.\r\n\r\nAgain, in a like case, a body is found bearing evidences of wounds or\r\nbruises. The question to be determined is whether they were inflicted\r\nbefore or after death; if before death, whether they were sufficient to\r\ncause death. Some wounds and injuries might be sufficiently apparent\r\nand dangerous so that the common, inexperienced eye would at once\r\ndetect that they were sufficient to cause death. But in most instances\r\nthis is not the case, and in such instances the testimony of experts\r\nis required by the necessity of the case, to show that the wounds and\r\ninjuries were sufficient to cause death.\r\n\r\n_The General Rules Stated as to Subjects for Expert Testimony._—Hence\r\nthe general rule is, that wherever the facts to be investigated\r\nare such that common experience and knowledge of men do not enable\r\nthem to draw accurate conclusions, but are such that the study and\r\nexperience of specialists do enable such specially endowed persons to\r\ndraw accurate conclusions, then the inferences and deductions they\r\nhave drawn can be testified to by those who qualify themselves before\r\nthe court as persons having sufficient skill and experience as such\r\nspecialists to entitle them to give opinions. The cases in which expert\r\ntestimony is permitted to be given are set forth in Rogers on Expert\r\nTestimony, Sec. 6, quoting from Jones _v._ Tucker (41 N. H., 546), as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“1. Upon questions of science, skill, or trade, or others of like kind.\r\n\r\n“2. Where the subject-matter of inquiry is such that inexperienced\r\npersons are unlikely to prove capable of forming a correct judgment\r\nwithout such assistance.\r\n\r\n“3. Where the subject-matter of investigation so far partakes of the\r\nnature of science as to require a course or previous habit of study in\r\norder to the attainment of knowledge of it.”\r\n\r\nSo also Chief Justice Shaw of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, in\r\nNew England Glass Co. _v._ Lovell (7 Cushing, 319), said:\r\n\r\n“It is not because a man has a reputation for sagacity and judgment\r\nand power of reasoning that his opinion is admissible in testifying\r\nas a witness. If so, such men might be called in all cases to advise\r\nthe jury, and it would change the mode of trial; but it is because a\r\nman’s professional pursuit, or his peculiar skill and knowledge of some\r\ndepartment of science not common to men in general, enable him to draw\r\ninferences where men of common experience, after all the facts have\r\nbeen proved, would be left in doubt.”\r\n\r\nTo the same effect see Muldowney _v._ Illinois Central R. R. Co., 36\r\nIowa, 472; Wharton on Evidence, Sec. 436; Greenleaf on Evidence, Sec.\r\n441.\r\n\r\n_Qualifications of this General Rule._—The extent to which an expert\r\nwitness can go in giving his opinion is limited to matters of science\r\nand skill, and does not extend to the expression of views on matters\r\nof legal or moral observation, or the manner in which others would\r\nprobably be influenced if the parties had acted in one way rather than\r\nin another. Campbell _v._ Richards, 5 B. & Ad., 345.\r\n\r\nSo it has been held that the question whether a physician has honorably\r\nand faithfully discharged his duty in a given case, either to his\r\nmedical profession or to his patient, is not a question of science but\r\nof pure ethics, upon which the jury is as competent to decide as any\r\none else, and in such a case an opinion would not be allowed to be\r\ngiven either by another medical practitioner or by a professor in the\r\nscience of morals. Rogers on Expert Testimony, Sec. 11, citing Ramadge\r\n_v._ Ryan, 9 Bing., 333.\r\n\r\nThere are also some matters of fact which apparently transcend the\r\ndividing line between common experience and judgment and scientific\r\nexperience and judgment, as to which expert testimony is not\r\nreceivable, but the jury and court must weigh the facts and draw the\r\ninferences for themselves. An interesting example of this is found in\r\nthe case of Manke _v._ The People, 78 N. Y., 611 (17 Hun, 410), cited\r\nin Stephens’ “Digest of the Law of Evidence,” p. 107, note H, decided\r\nin the New York Court of Appeals a few years ago. In that case one\r\nAdolf was killed by a gunshot, and pieces of paper were found near the\r\nscene of the homicide bearing certain marks. An expert was called upon\r\nto say whether they were powder-marks, and whether the condition of the\r\npaper was such that in his opinion it was wadding which had been fired\r\nfrom a gun. This evidence was held to be inadmissible by the General\r\nTerm of the Supreme Court, and this decision was affirmed by the Court\r\nof Appeals. These courts held that the question as to whether this was\r\na wad fired from a gun was a matter which the jury was as competent to\r\njudge of as the witness. In delivering the opinion at General Term,\r\nPresiding Justice Talcott said that this case was very close to the\r\nborder line, but in his judgment it was beyond the province of experts\r\nand within the province of jurors.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in that case the evidence of chemists who had examined\r\nthe wadding, and had discovered the marks on it which were said to\r\nbe powder-marks, and upon analysis had determined that they were\r\npowder-marks, or that they were marks of powder which had exploded,\r\nwould have been clearly admissible.\r\n\r\nThe subjects concerning which medical men may be called upon to\r\ntestify as experts are as numerous as the diseases, injuries, mental\r\nand physical conditions of the human race which fall within the range\r\nof the practice of medicine and surgery. It is therefore practically\r\nimpossible to give them in detail.[185]\r\n\r\n_Practical Suggestions and Admonitions Embodied in Rules._—It\r\nis deemed advisable that the following practical suggestions and\r\nadmonitions to physicians, concerning their duties as expert witnesses,\r\nshall here be given.\r\n\r\nFirst: A physician should refuse to testify as an expert unless he is\r\nconscious that he is really qualified as an expert.\r\n\r\nSecond: After accepting the responsibility, his first duty should be\r\nto make a diligent examination and preparation for his testimony,\r\nunless it is upon a subject with which he is familiar and which he\r\nis satisfied that he has already exhausted, by reading the best\r\nauthorities that he can find, and by careful reflection upon particular\r\nquestions as to which his opinion will be asked.\r\n\r\nThird: Where he is to make an examination of facts, such as the\r\npost-mortem examination of a body, a chemical analysis or an\r\nexamination of an alleged insane person, he should insist upon having\r\nplenty of time and full opportunity for doing his work thoroughly. He\r\nshould take particular pains to make his examination open and fair,\r\nand, if possible, should invite opposing experts to co-operate with him\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nFourth: He should be honest with his client before the trial in\r\nadvising him and giving him opinions, and upon the trial should\r\npreserve an absolutely impartial attitude, concealing nothing,\r\nperverting nothing, exaggerating nothing.\r\n\r\nFifth: On the preliminary examination as to his qualifications as a\r\nwitness he should be frank and open in answering questions. He should\r\nstate fully the extent and the limits of his personal experience and of\r\nhis reading upon the subject, without shrinking from responsibility,\r\nyet without self-glorification.\r\n\r\nSixth: He should be simple, plain, and clear in his statement of\r\nscientific facts and principles, avoiding the use of technical\r\nlanguage, and trying to put his ideas in such form that they will be\r\ngrasped and comprehended by men of ordinary education and intelligence.\r\n\r\nSeventh: He should avoid stating any conclusions or principles of which\r\nhe is not certain, but having an assurance that he is right he should\r\nbe firm and positive. He should admit the limitations of his knowledge\r\nand ability. Where a question is asked which he cannot answer, he\r\nshould not hesitate to say so; but he should refuse to be led outside\r\nthe subject of inquiry, and should confine his testimony to those\r\nscientific questions which are really involved in the case, or in his\r\nexamination of the case.\r\n\r\nEighth: And finally, he should always bear in mind that at the close\r\nof his testimony an opportunity is usually given to him to explain\r\nanything which he may be conscious of having said, which requires\r\nexplanation; and partial statements which need a qualification to make\r\nthem a truth. This is the physician’s opportunity to set himself right\r\nwith the court and with the jury. If the course of the examination has\r\nbeen unsatisfactory to him, he can then, by a brief and plain statement\r\nof the general points which he has intended to convey by his testimony,\r\nsweep away all the confusion and uncertainty arising from the long\r\nexamination and cross-examination, and can often succeed in producing\r\nfor the first time the impression which he desires to produce, and can\r\npresent the scientific aspects of the case briefly and correctly.\r\n\r\nProbably no man was ever so gifted as to be able in practice to carry\r\nout all of these principles in giving medical testimony. If he could,\r\nhe would be the ideal expert witness. But the principles are, after\r\nall, simple and easily followed in the main. Any physician who knows\r\nhis subject and who has a clear head and the ordinary faculty of\r\nexpression, by observing these principles can make himself invaluable\r\nas an expert witness. There is no branch of the profession which brings\r\na broader fame, greater influence, or larger emoluments than this.\r\nThere is no branch, on the other hand, in which men of real ability\r\nmake more lamentable failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMALPRACTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.—MALPRACTICE may be defined to be—\r\n\r\n1st. Wilful acts on the part of a physician or surgeon toward a person\r\nunder his care, by which such person suffers death or injury;\r\n\r\n2d. Acts forbidden by express statute, on the part of a physician or\r\nsurgeon, toward a person under his care, by which such person suffers\r\ndeath or injury;\r\n\r\n3d. Negligent acts on the part of a physician or surgeon in treating a\r\npatient, by means of which such patient suffers death or unnecessary\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nThese various divisions will be considered in the order in which they\r\nare above set forth.\r\n\r\n=Wilful Malpractice.=—The cases which fall within the first two\r\ndivisions of this definition are such acts as render the medical\r\nman liable to punishment in a criminal prosecution, and may not\r\nnecessarily, although in some instances they may, constitute grounds of\r\nliability in a civil suit against him.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the first class of cases may be cited those instances,\r\nhappily not numerous in the annals of the profession, where a physician\r\nor surgeon when treating a female patient has had carnal connection\r\nwith her, representing that he was using that method of treating her to\r\ncure her disease. Such a case was Reg. _v._ Case, 1 Eng. Law & Eq., 544\r\n(s. c., 1 Den. C. C., 580).[186]\r\n\r\n_Honest Intent no Defence in Such Cases._—In Reg. _v._ Reed, 1 Den.\r\nC. C., 377 (s. c., 2 Car. & K., 967), it was contended as a defence\r\nthat the defendant really believed that he was curing his patient by\r\ntreating her in this extraordinary way. The Court, per Wildes, C. J.,\r\nbrushed aside this contention with scorn, saying: “The notion that a\r\nmedical man may lawfully adopt such a method of treatment is not to\r\nbe tolerated in a court of justice;” and in this case and in others,\r\nconvictions have been sustained for the crime of rape or of attempting\r\nto commit rape.[187]\r\n\r\nAnother example of wilful malpractice would be wilful neglect of a\r\npatient by his medical attendant, who became intoxicated voluntarily,\r\nthough this will generally come under the second subdivision, as most\r\nstates and countries have enacted statutes making it a criminal offence\r\nto practise medicine or surgery when intoxicated.\r\n\r\n=Acts Forbidden by Statute.=—Within the second subdivision of the\r\ndefinition, or acts declared unlawful by statute, fall the cases\r\nof committing or attempting to commit an abortion, and cases of\r\nprescribing for or treating a patient by one voluntarily intoxicated.\r\nIf the abortion is attempted without the knowledge or consent of the\r\nwoman, and under the pretence of performing a necessary operation upon\r\nher to cure disease, undoubtedly the physician would be liable to a\r\ncriminal prosecution by the State for the offence of committing an\r\nabortion and to civil action by her to recover damages. If the abortion\r\nwas committed with her consent, while she would have no right of action\r\nagainst him for damages, he would be liable to criminal prosecution\r\nunder the statute.\r\n\r\n_Abortion Not a Crime by the Common Law._—At common law it was not\r\na crime to commit an abortion with the mother’s consent if the child\r\nhad not quickened. In Mitchell _v._ Com., 78 Ky., 204 (s. c., 39\r\nAm. Reports, 227), the Court, per Hines, J., says: “After a patient\r\ninvestigation we are forced to the conclusion that it was never called\r\na punishable offence at common law to produce, with the consent of the\r\nmother, an abortion prior to the time when the mother became quick with\r\nchild. It was not even murder at common law to take the life of the\r\nchild at any period of gestation, even in the very act of delivery.”\r\nSee also Evans _v._ People, 49 N. Y., 86.\r\n\r\nThe inhumanity and danger to society of this rule became manifest at a\r\nvery early period, and both in England and in this country statutes\r\nwere adopted, varying somewhat in the degree and kind of punishment and\r\nin the nomenclature of the crime, but all of them making the offence\r\nof committing an abortion, no matter at what stage of gestation, a\r\ncrime.[188]\r\n\r\n_The Common-Law Doctrine Criticised._—Professor Elwell in his valuable\r\nwork on “Malpractice, Medical Evidence and Insanity,” pp. 250, 251,\r\nmakes the following remarks upon this subject: “The idea once existed\r\nquite generally, and it still exists to some extent, that there is no\r\noffence in destroying the embryo or fœtus before there is a manifest\r\nknowledge of life by the mother, derived from motion of the child\r\ncalled ‘quickening.’ How absurd to suppose that there is no life\r\nuntil the mother can feel the muscular motions of the child! As well\r\nmight we deny the vitality of the blood because it cannot be felt.\r\nThe muscular tissues, and even the bones to which they are attached,\r\nmust have some degree of substance before there can be motion, and of\r\ncourse this development depends upon life. Though this foolish notion\r\nis now fully exploded in medicine, it still lingers in the popular\r\nmind, and doubtless leads to much crime. The life of the fœtus or\r\nembryo immediately after conception is just as positive physiologically\r\nas at any subsequent period. Quickening being an incident or sign\r\nin the course of development of the fœtus, it indicates not the\r\ncommencement of a new state of existence, but only a new manifestation\r\nof pre-existing life.... It is uncertain in its appearance, sometimes\r\ncoming on at three months, sometimes at six months, and sometimes not\r\nat all.”\r\n\r\n_Legal Definitions of Terms, “Quick with Child,” etc._—In Evans _v._\r\nPeople, 49 N. Y., 86, following R. _v._ Wycherly, 8 C. & P., 262,\r\nit was held that a woman is “quick with child” from the period of\r\nconception after the commencement of gestation, but is “pregnant with\r\nquick child” only when the child has become “quickened in the womb.”\r\nThis distinction has been discussed in State _v._ Cooper, 2 Zab., N.\r\nJ., 52, and since the Evans case, the same court in New York State has\r\nheld that the expression, “woman with child,” means “pregnant woman.”\r\nEckhardt _v._ People, 83 N. Y., 42 (s. c., 38 Am. Rep., 462).\r\n\r\n_Death of Child by Abortion._—If, in attempting to produce an\r\nabortion, the child is caused to be born alive but before the end of\r\nthe period of gestation, and when it is not capable of sustaining life,\r\nand it dies, the person producing the abortion and bringing the child\r\ninto the world at this time and in this manner is guilty of murder.\r\nWharton’s Crim. Law, sec. 942; Rex. _v._ West, 2 Cox Crim. Cases, 500;\r\nCom. _v._ Brown, 14 Gray, Mass., 419.\r\n\r\n_Death of Mother by Abortion._—So also where in consequence of\r\nproducing an abortion the death of the mother occurs, the person\r\nproducing the abortion is guilty of murder at common law. 4\r\nBlackstone’s Com., 201; 1 Bishop’s Crim. Law, 328. In some of the\r\nStates, however, these offences are declared to be only manslaughter.\r\n\r\nFurther consideration of the subject of abortion will be had under that\r\ntitle in another part of this work.\r\n\r\n_Statutes Generally Except Abortions Necessary to Save Life._—It\r\nshould be noted here, however, that nearly all the statutes which\r\ndefine and punish the crime of abortion, or the crime of manslaughter\r\nor murder committed in consequence of abortion, declare that when it is\r\nnecessary to produce a miscarriage in order to save life, the act of\r\ndoing so is excepted from the effect of the statute.\r\n\r\n=Negligent Malpractice.=—Under the third subdivision of the\r\ndefinition, viz., when by reason of the negligent acts on the part\r\nof the physician or surgeon the patient suffers death or unnecessary\r\ninjury, may be placed the most numerous cases of malpractice, according\r\nto the generally accepted meaning of the term.\r\n\r\n_Criminal Liability for Negligent Malpractice._—It is manifest that\r\nnot every degree of negligence which causes death or injury ought to\r\nrender the physician or surgeon liable to indictment and punishment\r\nfor a crime. The general theory of the criminal law is based upon the\r\ndoctrine that in order to constitute a crime there must be either\r\nan intent to do the wrong, or such a degree of negligence in the\r\nperformance of a given act as to supply the place of the intent to do\r\nwrong, and require punishment for the protection of society, upon the\r\nground that the carelessness of the defendant is so great as to make\r\nit necessary and proper to punish him, in order to deter others from\r\nfollowing his example.\r\n\r\n_Doctrine of Leading Case of Com. v. Thompson._—In Com. _v._ Thompson\r\n(6 Mass., 134), Parsons, C. J., observes: “There was no evidence to\r\ninduce the belief that the prisoner by his treatment intended to\r\nkill or injure the deceased and the ground of express malice must\r\nfall. It has been said that implied malice may be inferred from the\r\nrash and presumptuous conduct of the prisoner in administering such\r\nviolent medicines. Before implied malice can be inferred, the judges\r\nmust be satisfied that the prisoner by his treatment of his patient\r\nwas wilfully regardless of his social duties, being determined on\r\nmischief.... To constitute manslaughter, the killing must have been the\r\nconsequence of some unlawful act. Now there is no law which prohibits\r\nany man from prescribing for a sick person with his consent; and it is\r\nnot a felony, if through his ignorance of the quality of the medicine\r\nprescribed, or of the nature of the disease, or of both, the patient,\r\ncontrary to his expectations, should die. The death of a man killed by\r\nvoluntarily following a medical prescription cannot be adjudged felony\r\nin the party prescribing unless he, however ignorant of medical science\r\nin general, had so much knowledge or probable information of the fatal\r\ntendency of the prescription that it may be reasonably presumed by\r\nthe jury to be an act of wilful rashness at least, and not of honest\r\nintention and expectation to cure.”\r\n\r\n_The Doctrine of the Thompson Case Too Broad._—This lax statement\r\nof the law, made by the learned chief justice in this case, has been\r\nmuch doubted and criticised. It appears to be unsound in the length to\r\nwhich it goes in requiring, in order to constitute criminal liability,\r\nwhat may be termed excessive gross carelessness or wilful gross\r\ncarelessness. It apparently runs counter to the prevailing opinions of\r\nthe English judges, and to the later decisions of the courts in the\r\nUnited States, although it is followed and approved in Rice _v._ The\r\nState, 8 Mo., 561.\r\n\r\nIn Rex _v._ Long (4 Car. & P., 308-310), Park, J., said: “I call it\r\nacting wickedly when a man is grossly ignorant and yet affects to cure\r\npeople, or when he is grossly inattentive to their safety.”\r\n\r\nSo in Rex _v._ Spiller (5 Car. & P., 353), the Court said: “If a\r\nperson, whether a medical man or not, professes to deal with the\r\nlife and health of another, he is bound to use competent skill and\r\nsufficient attention; and if he causes the death of another through\r\ngross want of either he will be guilty of manslaughter.”\r\n\r\nBishop, in his work on Criminal Law, lays down the rule that not every\r\ndegree of carelessness renders a practitioner liable to criminal\r\nprosecution, and that it must be gross, or, as more strongly expressed,\r\n“the grossest ignorance or most criminal inattention.”[189]\r\n\r\nNevertheless he quotes with approval (2 Bishop Crim. Law, 264) the\r\nremark of Willes, J., that a medical man is taking a leap in the dark\r\nif he knew he was using medicines beyond his knowledge; and also the\r\nremarks of Bayley, J., in Rex _v._ Simpson (1 Lewin, 172), who said in\r\nthat case: “I am clear that if a person not having a medical education,\r\nand in a place where a person of a medical education might be obtained,\r\ntakes it upon himself to administer medicines which may have an\r\ninjurious effect, and such medicines destroy the life of the person to\r\nwhom they are administered, it is manslaughter. The party may not mean\r\nto cause death, or the medicine may produce beneficent effects, but he\r\nhas no right to hazard medicine of a dangerous tendency when medical\r\nassistance can be obtained. If he does, he does it at his peril.”[190]\r\n\r\n_Gross Negligence Defined._—In general it may be stated that gross\r\nnegligence is necessary to constitute criminal liability, but this may\r\nbe predicated upon, or inferred from, such want of ordinary care and\r\nskill as shows gross ignorance, or such want of attention as indicates\r\nwilful disregard of the well-known laws of life and health.[191]\r\n\r\n_Gross Negligence Resulting in Injury a Misdemeanor._—It has also been\r\nheld that although death does not but injury does ensue, as the result\r\nof gross negligence or inattention, that constitutes a misdemeanor\r\npunishable criminally.[192]\r\n\r\n_In Determining Degree of Negligence Circumstances and Conditions\r\nGovern._—It should be noted, however, that the circumstances and\r\nconditions attending the act of alleged criminal malpractice should\r\nbe given much weight. So also should due weight be given to the\r\nadvancement of knowledge and education in the world in general, and\r\nin the medical profession in particular. In an early English case,\r\none of the judges remarked that not as much knowledge and skill could\r\nbe expected of a surgeon or physician in a sparsely settled country\r\ndistrict as in a city, and that he was at a loss to know what degree\r\nof knowledge and skill should be required of such a person. But in\r\nGram _v._ Boener, 56 Ind., 447, Worden, J., said: “It seems to us that\r\nphysicians or surgeons practising in small towns, or in poorly or\r\nsparsely settled country districts, are bound to possess and exercise\r\nat least the average degree of skill possessed and exercised by the\r\nprofession in such localities generally. It is not true, as we think,\r\nto say that if a physician and surgeon has exercised such a degree\r\nof skill as is ordinarily exercised in the particular locality in\r\nwhich he practises, that would be sufficient. There might be but few\r\npractising in the given locality, all of whom might be quacks, ignorant\r\npretenders to knowledge not possessed by them, and it would not do\r\nto say that because one possessed and exercised as much skill as the\r\nother, he could not be chargeable with the want of reasonable care and\r\nskill.”[193]\r\n\r\n_Unlicensed Practitioner Causing Death Guilty of Manslaughter._—Since\r\nthe adoption by most civilized states and countries of the salutary\r\npractice of regulating by statute the practice of medicine and surgery,\r\nand forbidding persons not duly licensed from practising, and making it\r\na misdemeanor to violate any of these statutes, it is clear that any\r\nperson not having the requisite medical education and a license, who\r\nattempted to administer drugs and medicines or to perform operations,\r\nand through want of ordinary knowledge and skill caused the death of\r\nanother, would be held guilty of manslaughter, because he brought about\r\nthe death while he himself was engaged in a violation of the law. In\r\nsome states where no discrimination in this respect is made between\r\nmisdemeanors and felonies, the crime would be murder, punishable by\r\ndeath; and it has always been the law that an empiric or quack holding\r\nhimself out as a regular physician is bound to have and exhibit the\r\ndegree of skill and care which he professes, and will be strictly held\r\nto the standard of skill of educated and licensed medical men.[194]\r\n\r\nAs to the legal meaning of the term “ordinary care and skill,” and the\r\nrules of evidence applicable in cases of malpractice, a full discussion\r\nwill be had below, when considering the subject of civil liability for\r\nmalpractice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIVIL LIABILITY FOR MALPRACTICE.\r\n\r\nAny person holding himself out to be a physician or surgeon, or any\r\nphysician or surgeon, who is guilty of malpractice, is liable for\r\ndamages, to be recovered in a civil action, instituted by the person\r\ninjured, or by those having a legal right to such person’s services.\r\nThis is so whether the injured person actually employed the defendant\r\nto prescribe or treat him, or not. The liability flows out of the\r\nrelationship, without regard to the element of employment, and it may\r\nresult from negligence in treatment, or in prescribing, or in giving\r\ninformation and instructions to the patient as to how to take care of\r\nhimself when under treatment. The rules of law applicable to the duties\r\nof a physician to his patient are stated and the authorities supporting\r\nthem cited in Chapter IV. of this work.[195]\r\n\r\n=Ordinary Care and Skill Only Required.=—The leading cases in America\r\non the subject of civil liability for malpractice are: Leighton _v._\r\nSargent, 7 N. H., 460, and Carpenter _v._ Blake, 60 Barb., 485 (s. c.\r\non appeal, 75 N. Y., 12). In the former case the Court said: “In a\r\nscience encumbered with so many sources of error and difficulties, it\r\nis obvious what cause we have for proceeding with the utmost caution,\r\nand for advancing from step to step with the greatest circumspection.\r\nIt is in consideration of those peculiar difficulties that beset and\r\nencompass the physician and surgeon, that all enlightened courts have\r\nheld that but ordinary care and skill shall be required of them, and\r\nthat mere errors of judgment shall be overlooked, if the general\r\ncharacter of treatment has been honest and intelligent, and that the\r\nresult of the case shall not determine the amount of the responsibility\r\nto which he is held; and that when unskilfulness or negligent treatment\r\nof his patient is charged to a surgeon, it is not enough to show that\r\nhe has not treated his patient in that mode or has not used measures\r\nwhich in the opinion of others, though medical men, the case required;\r\nbecause such evidence tends to prove errors of judgment, for which the\r\ndefendant is not responsible, as much as it goes to prove a want of\r\nreasonable skill and care for which he may be responsible. Alone it is\r\nnot evidence of the latter, and therefore a party must go further and\r\nprove, by other evidence, that the defendant assumed the character and\r\nundertook to act as a physician without the education, knowledge, and\r\nskill which entitled him to act in that capacity.”\r\n\r\nIn Carpenter _v._ Blake, upon the last appeal (75 N. Y., 12), it was\r\nsaid that the reasonable ordinary care and diligence which the law\r\nrequires of physicians and surgeons is that which persons engaged in\r\nthe same general line of practice have and exercise in like cases.[196]\r\n\r\n_Story’s Statement of the Rule._—Story in his work on Bailments, p.\r\n433, with his usual felicitous method of statement says: “In all cases\r\nwhere skill is required it is to be understood that it means _ordinary_\r\nskill in the business or employment which the bailee undertakes; for\r\nhe is not presumed to undertake for extraordinary skill, which belongs\r\nto a few men only in his business or employment, or for extraordinary\r\nendowments or acquirements. Reasonable skill constitutes the measure of\r\nthe engagement in regard to the thing undertaken.”\r\n\r\n_Occult Influences Should be Considered by Lawyers and Judges._—In\r\nthis connection it should be borne in mind by lawyers and judges, that\r\nin the case of a physician treating disease, or a surgeon repairing\r\nan injury, occult influences frequently play a most important part.\r\nProfessor Elwell in his work on Malpractice, etc., p. 25, lays great\r\nstress on this element of uncertainty. He says: “In the case of\r\nphysicians, surgeons, attorneys, etc., another and important element\r\nbesides skill enters into the result, and for this reason the degree\r\nof responsibility is to a certain extent and in a manner indicated\r\nand influenced. This important element is the operation of causes and\r\ninfluences over which the practitioner has but little or no control.\r\nThey are occult, and no human foresight is able to anticipate them\r\nbefore they have completely deranged and materially interfered with\r\nhis plans by bringing about a different result than that confidently\r\ndepended upon.”[197]\r\n\r\n_Change and Advancement in Medical Knowledge also to be\r\nConsidered._—It should on the other hand be clearly understood that\r\nthe constant change and improvement which are going on in medical and\r\nsurgical education, in the discovery of new remedies and new methods\r\nof treatment, and in the invention of new instruments, tend constantly\r\nto elevate the average skill and intelligence of the profession, and\r\nwith them the standard by which the courts will determine liability for\r\nnegligence. What would have been, but a few years ago, fully recognized\r\nby the courts as ordinary skill in the treatment of disease and the\r\nperformance of operations, would now be regarded as antiquated and less\r\nthan ordinary skill, because of the advancement in the knowledge of\r\nmeans which can be devoted to the treatment of disease and injury.[198]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that what is the degree of skill to be required\r\nof one practising in a small town or a country district sparsely\r\ninhabited, and what is required in the case of a city practitioner, may\r\ndiffer to some extent with the circumstances. Quacks and pretenders,\r\nhowever, must be judged by the standard of regular practitioners.[199]\r\n\r\n=Degree of Care and Skill a Mixed Question of Law and Fact.=—What\r\nconstitutes reasonable care and skill is a mixed question of law and\r\nfact, like any other question of negligence. Where the evidence is\r\nundisputed and no conflicting inferences can be drawn from the facts\r\npresented, it is the duty of the Court to determine whether or not\r\nthere is sufficient proof of want of ordinary care and skill to be\r\nsubmitted to the jury. Where, however, the evidence is conflicting on\r\nthat point, or the inferences to be drawn from the facts established\r\nmight be differently drawn by different men having the same opportunity\r\nfor observation, and the same circumstances before them, it is for\r\nthe jury to say whether or not the defendant has exercised reasonable\r\ncare and skill, guided by proper directions from the Court as to the\r\nmeasure of skill required. This involves the question as to how far\r\nthe practitioner is bound to be familiar with the methods, appliances,\r\ndrugs, and methods of treatment of his profession in general.[200]\r\n\r\n_Experimentation Not Permissible._—Experimentation, whether upon\r\ncharity patients or pay patients, is equally prohibited by well-settled\r\nrules of law. In other words, a departure from known methods of\r\ntreatment for the purpose of or by way of trying unknown remedies, or\r\noperations not usually adopted by the profession, if an unfortunate\r\nresult occurs, renders the defendant liable (McNevins _v._ Lowe, 40\r\nIll., 209).\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURE OF DAMAGES.\r\n\r\nThe measure of damages in cases of malpractice may vary with the kind\r\nof malpractice. In the case of wilful malpractice, the element of\r\ngross negligence justifies punitive or retaliatory damages, in those\r\nStates where any such damages are allowed. That is, damages which will\r\nnot only compensate for the injuries inflicted, but which will, by\r\npunishing the wrong done, tend to repress similar acts in the future.\r\nThe tendency of the courts and of legal authority of the present time\r\nis, however, to limit as often as possible the cases in which punitive\r\ndamages are allowed, upon the theory that if a grossly negligent act is\r\ncommitted it will require criminal prosecution, and that the strong\r\narm of the State should be invoked to punish the wrong, rather than to\r\nline the pocket of the injured person.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in cases of malpractice, damages for want of\r\nordinary care and skill are recompensed as in any other cases of\r\nnegligence. They may include loss of time of the patient, inability\r\nto earn his living, such sum as the jury thinks is reasonable to be\r\ngiven as a compensation for the extra pain and suffering, and, where\r\nthe injury is permanent, such further sum as will indemnify the\r\npatient for the injury or deformity which he may suffer on account of\r\nthe defendant’s neglect. Citation of authority upon this question of\r\ndamages is almost unnecessary.[201]\r\n\r\n_Liabilities of Partners, etc._—It has been held that where two\r\nphysicians were partners, and one of them committed an act of negligent\r\nmalpractice, both were liable in a civil court for damages.[202]\r\n\r\nBut the declarations of the partner who is guilty of the negligent act,\r\nmade as to the act committed, and in the absence of the other partner,\r\nare not admissible as against the other partner. And so also is the\r\nrule as to declarations of the partner who committed the act after its\r\ncommission as to the propriety of the treatment, and opinions expressed\r\nby him in reference thereto.[203]\r\n\r\nIt has also been held that one surgeon who recommends the employment of\r\nanother during his absence from town is not liable for acts committed\r\nduring his absence.[204]\r\n\r\n_Suits for Injuries to Married Women and Minor Children._—When the\r\nperson injured is a married woman, her husband may sue for loss of\r\nservices on account of malpractice, and when the injured person is a\r\nminor child the parent may sue as in any case of negligence. A third\r\nperson, such as the husband of a woman injured by malpractice, or\r\nthe father of minor child so injured, can only recover the value of\r\nthe services thereby lost, and in some cases the enhanced expense of\r\nmedical attention and nursing thereby rendered necessary.\r\n\r\n=Inspection of the Injured Person at the Trial—Before Trial\r\nImproper.=—In an action in which the injury is to a portion of the\r\nbody which may be seen, such as the shortening of a limb on account of\r\nimproper treatment of a fracture, the limb may be exhibited to the jury.\r\n\r\nIt has been much discussed whether the defendant in a malpractice or\r\nother negligence case can compel the plaintiff to permit his person\r\nto be examined by physicians before trial, to enable the defendant to\r\nknow the full extent of the injury so far as it is perceptible. In\r\nthe latest cases the examination of plaintiff before trial was not\r\nallowed.[205]\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the Supreme Court of Iowa in the case of Schroder _v._ C.,\r\nR. I. & P. R. R. Co., 47 Iowa, 375, held that the court had inherent\r\npower and jurisdiction to compel the plaintiff to submit to such an\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThis decision has been followed by the courts of several of the western\r\nand southern States, while in others the power has been denied. These\r\ncases will be found fully collected in Roberts _v._ O. & L. C. R. Co.\r\nand in U. P. R. R. Co. _v._ Botsford cited above.\r\n\r\nThe ground of the decision of the United States Supreme Court and of\r\nthe New York Court of Appeals seems to be, that in the absence of\r\nlegislative provision permitting a court to order such an examination,\r\nit has no inherent power to do so, and did not derive any such powers\r\nfrom the common-law courts of England, which never had exercised such\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nIn some of the cases which deny the right to compel such examination,\r\nit is claimed that if such a statute was passed as would confer upon\r\nthe courts power to compel such an examination, the statute would\r\nbe unconstitutional, and much is said in those decisions about the\r\nsacredness and immunity of the person. It seems difficult, however,\r\nto understand why such statutes should be considered as differing in\r\nany respect from statutes permitting orders for the examination of\r\nwitnesses and parties before trial, or for the discovery and inspection\r\nof books and papers, and the like, which statutes have been enacted for\r\nmany years and have never been held to be unconstitutional. Surely an\r\nhonest suitor having a just claim for damages for personal injuries\r\nwould not object to such an examination, because the result would\r\noften strengthen his case, while a dishonest suitor having a false\r\nand unmeritorious claim ought to be exposed and have his false claims\r\ndefeated, in the interests of justice and truth. On the other hand,\r\na suitor who was honestly mistaken in his belief that he had been\r\ndisfigured or injured by an act of malpractice might often discover his\r\nmistake, and be saved the annoyance and expense of defeat after a trial\r\nin open court.\r\n\r\nSome of the most frequent cases of alleged malpractice, brought before\r\nthe courts, are those in which it is claimed that a fractured limb\r\nhas been improperly set, with the result that it becomes crooked or\r\nshortened; when the fact is, as is conclusively shown by Prof. Frank\r\nH. Hamilton in a paper published by him many years ago, and quoted\r\nwith approval by Professor Elwell, in his work on Malpractice, etc.,\r\nthat the percentage of cases, in certain kinds of fractures, in which\r\nperfect results are obtained by even the most eminent surgeons, is very\r\nsmall. In such cases as these the true state of affairs might often be\r\ndisclosed by careful inspection prior to the trial. On the whole more\r\ngood than harm would seem to be the probable outcome of permitting such\r\nexaminations, in malpractice cases, if not in all cases of alleged\r\npersonal injuries.\r\n\r\n=Evidence in Malpractice Cases.=—The prevailing trial practice in\r\nmalpractice cases is to prove the condition of the patient prior to\r\nthe employment of defendant and at the time the treatment in question\r\nbegan, the methods of treatment adopted, and instructions given,\r\nand the condition of the patient during and after such treatment,\r\nand then to place other physicians on the witness-stand, and put to\r\nthem hypothetical questions involving the facts as established by\r\nthe evidence, and calling upon them to state whether the method of\r\ntreatment adopted indicated proper skill and care, or even the usual\r\nand recognized methods of the profession.[206]\r\n\r\nIn some States evidence of the general reputation of the defendant for\r\nskilfulness or the contrary is held admissible. In other States such\r\nevidence is held inadmissible (see Vol. XIV., Am. and Eng. Encyclopædia\r\nof Law, p. 83, and cases collected in Note 6).\r\n\r\n=Contributory Negligence.=—In conclusion it should be stated that\r\nthe patient is bound to follow obediently all proper directions given\r\nhim by his physician or surgeon, as to his diet, mode of life, time\r\nof taking and quantity of medicine to be taken, or the care of a\r\ndiseased or injured member. Any disobedience of such directions which\r\ncontributes to prevent a recovery will bar him from his right of action\r\nfor malpractice, even though the medical man may have been somewhat\r\nnegligent. In short, the same rule as to contributory negligence\r\napplies in this as in any other case of negligence. This principle has\r\nbeen so long and so well settled that citation of authority in support\r\nof it is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF EVIDENCE\r\n\r\nCONCERNING\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\nBETWEEN\r\n\r\nPHYSICIAN AND PATIENT.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nCHARLES A. BOSTON,\r\n\r\n_Counsellor-at-Law, of the New York City Bar_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS.\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIAL communications between physician and patient not\r\ninfrequently may relate to matters that are the subjects of inquiry\r\nbefore judicial tribunals. When these communications are by law\r\nexcluded from disclosure in evidence, they are termed _privileged_\r\ncommunications. When such a disclosure is forbidden it is upon grounds\r\nof public policy,[207] “because greater mischiefs would probably result\r\nfrom requiring or permitting its admission, than from wholly rejecting\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON LAW.\r\n\r\nThe common law required an inviolable secrecy to be observed by\r\nattorneys with reference to the communications which they had received\r\nfrom their clients.[208] But writers upon the law of evidence state\r\nthat under the English rule protection from disclosure in evidence in a\r\ncourt of justice was not extended to communications between a medical\r\nman and his patient.[209]\r\n\r\n_Reasons for the Rule._—It does not clearly appear, in any of the\r\ncases usually cited as authority, why the distinction is made between\r\nlegal and medical advisers, but it is apparent that the privilege does\r\nnot rest upon considerations of honor nor of confidence,[210] nor\r\neven upon the urgency of the situation under which the communication\r\nis made; for disclosures are made to a physician frequently to save\r\nlife, or to a priest for reasons of eternal import, while those made\r\nto an attorney insure at most protection from temporal annoyance.\r\nThe privilege of attorneys seems to be founded upon considerations\r\nof public policy in the administration of justice in the courts;\r\nattorneys are a part of the system, as are grand jurors, petit jurors,\r\nand judges,[211] and even arbitrators;[212] but physicians are no\r\npart of that system, and a disclosure of confidences made to them in\r\nno way tends to weaken the system or render it ineffectual, while the\r\ncompulsory examination of lawyers would tend to the suppression of\r\nthe truth in litigation by discouraging confidence between attorney\r\nand client. This, perhaps, can be assigned as the reason for the\r\ndistinction; a distinction which does not differentiate lawyers from\r\nphysicians, but agents in the administration of justice from all\r\nothers.[213]\r\n\r\n_Criticism of the Rule._—Though the privilege of attorneys was adopted\r\nto enforce respect for the law as securing the rights of persons\r\nentitled to its protection, by establishing inviolable confidence\r\nbetween them and the officer who represents them in their dealings\r\nin the law, and though it was not the purpose of the law to enforce\r\nsentiment or to elevate one profession above another, the sentimental\r\nidea did not suffer neglect for the want of advocates. Justice Buller\r\nlamented the narrowness of the rule,[214] and Mr. Best has criticised\r\nit as harsh in itself, of questionable policy, and at variance with the\r\npractice in France and the statute law in some of the United States of\r\nAmerica.[215]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RULE IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nIt is to be assumed, in the absence of statutes varying the rule, and\r\nof decisions to the contrary, in the several States of the United\r\nStates, that in those States which derived their law from England the\r\nsame rule of evidence obtains as that above enunciated. But many of the\r\nlegislatures have by statute extended the privilege to communications\r\nbetween physicians and their patients, as well as to other specified\r\nconfidential communications which it does not fall within the scope of\r\nthis work to discuss.[216]\r\n\r\n_States and Territories in which there are No Restrictive\r\nStatutes._—The following States and Territories have no statute\r\nrestricting the nature of the disclosures which a physician may be\r\ncompelled to make in a court of justice: Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut,\r\nDelaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky,\r\nLouisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire,\r\nNew Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,\r\nTennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.[217]\r\n\r\n_States and Territories in which there are Restrictive Statutes._—The\r\nfollowing States and Territories have statutes restricting disclosures\r\nby physicians: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Indian\r\nTerritory, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana,\r\nNebraska, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,\r\nOklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and\r\nWyoming.[218]\r\n\r\n_The Rule in United States Courts._—In trials at common law in the\r\ncourts of the United States, the laws of the several States, except\r\nwhere the Constitution, treaties, or statutes of the United States\r\notherwise require or provide, are regarded as rules of decision.[219]\r\nSection 858 of the Revised Statutes of the United States prescribes\r\nrules with reference to competency notwithstanding color and interest\r\nof witnesses, and in actions by or against executors, administrators,\r\nor guardians, and then provides that “in all other respects the laws of\r\nthe State in which the court is held shall be the rules of decision as\r\nto the competency of witnesses in the courts of the United States in\r\ntrials at _common law_, and in _equity_ and _admiralty_.” Accordingly\r\nit has been held by the Supreme Court of the United States that in\r\nan action in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern\r\nDistrict of New York, on a policy of life insurance, the evidence of a\r\nphysician, inadmissible under Section 834 of the New York Code of Civil\r\nProcedure, was properly excluded.[220] But in criminal prosecutions in\r\nUnited States Courts, the privilege secured by State statutes does not\r\navail.[221]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATUTES.\r\n\r\nAs the effect of these statutes depends largely upon their language,\r\nthe construction put upon the law in one State is chiefly serviceable\r\nin interpreting that of another State in those particulars where the\r\ntwo are similar.\r\n\r\n_Statutory Declarations of Policy._—A comparative view of the several\r\nlaws shows that in the following States and Territory there are\r\ndeclarations of policy prefixed to the prohibition of disclosures,\r\nthat show the reason of the enactment, namely: California, Colorado,\r\nIdaho, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, and\r\nUtah.[222] The declaration is to the effect that there are particular\r\nrelations in which it is the policy of the law to encourage confidence\r\nand to preserve it inviolate, and that therefore the prohibition of the\r\nstatute is laid.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF THE STATUTES.\r\n\r\nThe common purpose of the statutes is to restrict the rule compelling\r\ndisclosures so as to protect communications with a physician in his\r\nprofessional capacity; but the limit to which the protection is\r\nextended differs in the various States. An analytic comparison of the\r\nstatutes tends to show how far the interpretation of one is useful in\r\nconstruing another.\r\n\r\n_I. Nature of the Exclusion._—In California, Idaho, Minnesota,\r\nMontana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, and Washington the\r\nstatutes apply only to testimony in civil actions.[223] The other\r\nstatutes make no distinction between civil and criminal proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe active words are of course different in the several statutes, but\r\nthey indicate a purpose to extend a privilege that the person entitled\r\nto it may insist upon maintaining, with the single exception of the\r\nlaw of North Carolina, which provides that the presiding judge of a\r\nsuperior court may compel a disclosure, if in his opinion the same is\r\nnecessary to a proper administration of justice.\r\n\r\nSome of the statutes show clearly that it is the patient’s privilege,\r\nand suffer the patient or his representatives to waive it, either\r\nexpressly or by conduct which the law declares to amount to a\r\nwaiver.[224] Others are silent on this subject.\r\n\r\nIn California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska,\r\nNevada, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah,\r\nWashington, and Wyoming, it is expressly provided that the patient’s\r\nconsent is necessary before a disclosure will be permitted.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Oregon, if the patient offer himself\r\nor a physician or surgeon as a witness, that is to be deemed a consent.\r\n\r\nIn Nevada, in any suit or prosecution for malpractice, if the patient\r\nor party suing or prosecuting shall require or give consent, and any\r\nphysician or surgeon shall give testimony, then the defendant may call\r\nany other physicians or surgeons as witnesses without the consent of\r\nthe patient or party suing or prosecuting.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio and Wyoming, if the patient voluntarily testify the physician\r\nmay be compelled to testify on the same subject.\r\n\r\n_II. The Witness._—In Indiana, Ohio, and Wyoming the privileged\r\nwitness is termed a _physician_; in the other States and Territories,\r\nthe privilege extends to a _physician_ or _surgeon_.\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas and Indian Territory the privilege is secured to a person\r\n_authorized to practise_ physic or surgery; in California, Montana,\r\nand Nevada, to a _licensed_ physician or surgeon; in Colorado, to a\r\nphysician or surgeon _duly authorized_ to practise his profession\r\n_under the laws of the State_; in Michigan, New York, North Carolina,\r\nand Wisconsin, to a person _duly authorized_ to practise physic or\r\nsurgery; in Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington, to a _regular_ physician\r\nor surgeon; in Iowa and Nebraska, to a _practising_ physician or\r\nsurgeon; in the remaining States and Territories, these statutes do not\r\nin terms distinguish between licensed and unlicensed practitioners.[225]\r\n\r\nIn New York, by the amendment of 1893 to Sec. 836 of the Code of Civil\r\nProcedure it is provided that in an action for the recovery of damages\r\nfor a personal injury the testimony of a physician or surgeon attached\r\nto any hospital, dispensary, or other charitable institution, as to\r\ninformation which he acquired in attending a patient in a professional\r\ncapacity in such institution, shall be taken before a referee. It\r\ndoes not appear whether this amendment is intended to take away the\r\nprivilege, or merely to regulate the manner of taking such testimony\r\nwhen it is otherwise admissible.[226]\r\n\r\n_III. The Evidence._—The character of the communications which\r\nare privileged differs under the several statutes. In Arkansas,\r\nCalifornia, Colorado, Idaho, Indian Territory, Michigan, Minnesota,\r\nMissouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota,\r\nOregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin, they are\r\ncharacterized as _information_; in Indiana, as _matter committed_; in\r\nIowa and Nebraska, as _confidential communications_; in Kansas, Ohio,\r\nOklahoma, and Wyoming, as _communications_; in Iowa and Nebraska, it\r\nis further provided that they be _properly intrusted_; and in Kansas\r\nand Oklahoma, that they be with reference to a _physical_ or _supposed\r\nphysical disease_.\r\n\r\nIn Kansas and Oklahoma, any knowledge obtained by a _personal\r\nexamination_ of a patient is also expressly privileged.\r\n\r\nIn Indiana, Ohio, and Wyoming, _advice_ given by the physician is\r\ncovered by the protection.\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas, Indian Territory, and Missouri, the privilege is limited\r\nto information acquired _from the patient_; and in Kansas and Oklahoma,\r\nto communications made _by the patient_.\r\n\r\nThe statutes of Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Indian\r\nTerritory, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada,\r\nNew York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah,\r\nWashington, and Wisconsin expressly limit the protection to matter\r\nacquired while attending in a professional capacity; and all of these,\r\nsave Indiana, as well as Iowa and Nebraska, confine the privilege to\r\ninformation necessary to enable the witness to prescribe or act for the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nIn New York it is provided that “a physician or surgeon may upon a\r\ntrial or examination disclose any information as to the mental or\r\nphysical condition of a patient who is deceased, which he acquired\r\nin attending such patient professionally, except confidential\r\ncommunications and such facts as would tend to disgrace the memory of\r\nthe patient, when the protection has been expressly waived on such\r\ntrial or examination by the personal representatives of the deceased\r\npatient, or if the validity of the last will and testament of such\r\ndeceased patient is in question, by the executor or executors named\r\nin said will, or the surviving husband, widow, or any heir at law,\r\nor any of the next of kin of such deceased, or any other party in\r\ninterest.”[227]\r\n\r\nThe notable characteristics of the several statutes which thus far\r\nhave been pointed out are discernible in the express language of the\r\nacts. In writing or using any treatise or compilation on privileged\r\ncommunications between physician and patient, it is to be constantly\r\nborne in mind that the privilege is of statutory origin; that the\r\nstatutes are often dissimilar; and that the value of a judicial\r\ninterpretation of one law in the construction of another varies with\r\nthe dissimilarity.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE STATUTES.\r\n\r\nThe judicial decisions which are discussed here are those that deal\r\nwith the privilege secured by the restrictive laws. The analogy between\r\nthe privilege of a client with regard to his attorney’s disclosures,\r\nand that of a patient with regard to the testimony of his physician, is\r\nnot so complete as to make it essential to present here, for the sake\r\nof their bearing upon the subject now under consideration, a study of\r\nthe principles to be deduced from the numerous decisions with reference\r\nto attorneys as witnesses. The analogous cases of clergymen and priests\r\nare also beyond the scope of this treatment.\r\n\r\n_Rules of Construction._—The restrictions are in derogation of the\r\ncommon law[228] and in accordance with the rule of interpretation\r\nordinarily adopted should be strictly construed,[229] but the courts\r\nhave generally looked at the policy of the enactments, and have\r\nconstrued them so as to preserve inviolably the confidence existing\r\nbetween physician and patient, without narrowing their effect to a\r\nstrict interpretation of their language.\r\n\r\nIn Indiana, under a former law which protected matters _confided_, it\r\nwas said that the statute should be given a broader scope than the\r\nword _confided_ in a strict sense imports, so as to cover matters\r\nlearned by observation and examination.[230] But, though the statute\r\nin terms absolutely prohibits a disclosure, it has been said, in\r\nIndiana, that it gives no right to the physician to refuse to testify\r\nwhere the patient waives the privilege,[231] and that it creates\r\nno absolute incompetency, because to hold otherwise would result in\r\nobstructing justice without subserving the purpose of the statute.[232]\r\nIn Missouri, there is a dictum that the privilege should be carefully\r\nlimited to what the statute requires, not so much because it is in\r\nderogation of the common law as because it is in exclusion of the best\r\nevidence, on the ground of privilege;[233] but in this very case, the\r\nreal question was whether the word _oral_ should be construed into\r\nthe statute so as to exclude from its protection information acquired\r\nby inspection and observation, and it was held that no such narrow\r\ninterpretation was proper. In a later case the narrowing dicta of\r\nthe foregoing opinion were disapproved,[234] and subsequently the\r\ndisposition to make a liberal construction was shown by the highest\r\ncourt of the State, although a general rule of interpretation was not\r\nannounced.[235] In New York, the rule that a statute in derogation\r\nof the common law is strictly construed does not apply to the Code\r\nof Civil Procedure.[236] But before the enactment of this statutory\r\nrule[237] there was a tendency to interpret liberally the law\r\nprohibiting disclosures.[238] In Arkansas the tendency seems to be to\r\nconstrue the law strictly.[239] The spirit of interpretation will be\r\nmore fully illustrated in the discussion of particular cases which\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nIn New York it was claimed that the protection afforded by the statute\r\nis nullified by the provision for the examination of a party before\r\ntrial,[240] but it was held that the statutes are consistent and the\r\nphysician cannot be made to disclose, though his patient may be.[241]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSES OF ACTIONS.\r\n\r\n_Criminal Actions and Evidence of Crime in Civil Actions._—The\r\nstatutes confining the restriction to civil actions have been cited\r\nabove.[242] In Iowa, in an action for breach of promise to marry,\r\nit was said that the privilege does not extend to the protection of\r\nadvice for the commission of a crime.[243] In New York the rule was\r\nat first embodied in the Revised Statutes of the State,[244] but\r\nupon the adoption of the Code of _Civil_ Procedure it was included\r\ntherein,[245] and subsequently the provision of the Revised Statutes\r\nwas repealed.[246] In that State by law the rules of evidence in civil\r\ncases are applicable also to criminal cases, except as otherwise\r\nexpressly provided;[247] and the statutes provide no different rule in\r\ncriminal actions as to this class of evidence. Notwithstanding this\r\nfact, however, it has been said by the Court of Appeals, in a case\r\nwhere there was an attempt to screen a murderer by insisting that\r\nhis victim’s physician was not a competent witness as to information\r\nacquired by him while attending his patient,[248] that the design\r\nof the law was to enable the patient to make known his condition to\r\nhis physician without the danger of disclosing what would annoy his\r\nfeelings, damage his character, or impair his standing while living,\r\nor disgrace his memory when dead, but that it was not intended to\r\nprotect a murderer rather than to shield his victim; and quoting from\r\nthe opinion of Talcott, J., in the court below,[249] the Court said:\r\n“The purpose for which the aid of the statute is invoked is so utterly\r\nforeign to the purpose and object of the act and so diametrically\r\nopposed to any intent which the legislature can be supposed to have\r\nhad in enacting it, so contrary to and inconsistent with its spirit,\r\nwhich most clearly intended to protect the patient and not to shield\r\none who is charged with his murder; that in such a case the statute is\r\nnot to be so construed as to be used as a weapon of defence to a party\r\nso charged instead of a protection to his victim.” Accordingly it was\r\nheld that the evidence was not to be excluded under the statute. But\r\nthe rule is still applicable to criminal actions. In a later case,\r\nwhere the accused was indicted for abortion, the same court held, that\r\nwhere the patient was living and the disclosure tended to convict her\r\ntoo of crime or to cast discredit and disgrace upon her, the evidence\r\nof her physician as to information acquired by him in attendance\r\nupon her was inadmissible in the trial of the man charged with the\r\ncrime.[250] In a still later case,[251] the General Term of the Supreme\r\nCourt held, where the accused was on trial for murder and he had\r\nconfided to a physician what he had done, that the physician could not\r\ndisclose the confidence. The rule deducible from these decisions seems\r\nto be that in New York the privilege extends to criminal actions, even\r\nthough they be trials for murder, and even though the person accused\r\nbe the patient, but that the statute will be applied only for the\r\nprotection of the patient, and where it is apparent that no injury can\r\npossibly be done to the patient or his memory by the admission of the\r\nevidence, and the interests of justice demand the disclosure, for the\r\npunishment of a person for an injury done to the patient involving a\r\nviolation of the criminal law, and the patient is not alive to waive\r\nthe privilege, that the disclosure is not forbidden.\r\n\r\nIn New York efforts have been made to exclude from the operation of\r\nthe statute other classes of actions, to which it has been urged that\r\nthe reasons for the enactment do not apply, or in which the mischief\r\nalleged to be wrought by its enforcement has been suggested as ground\r\nfor believing that the legislature could not have intended to include\r\nthem. Of these, actions for divorce on the ground of adultery are one\r\nclass; but it has been held that they constitute no exception.[252]\r\n\r\n_Testamentary Causes._—In New York it was long supposed that the\r\npolicy of the law excepted probate proceedings; it was so held by\r\nthe Surrogate of New York City;[253] and also by the General Term\r\nof the Supreme Court,[254] by which it was stated that the practice\r\nhad prevailed for a half-century in will cases,[255] but the Court\r\nof Appeals,[256] has decided that testamentary cases constitute no\r\nexception to the rule, the judge who delivered the opinion stating\r\nthat there is no more reason for allowing secret ailments of a patient\r\nto be brought to light in a contest over his will than in any other\r\ncase, and that if mischief be wrought by the law the remedy lies with\r\nthe legislature and not with the courts. The legislature has since\r\nafforded the remedy,[257] but not to the extent of adopting the rule of\r\nthe earlier cases. In Indiana, in an action to set aside a will, the\r\ntestimony of the testator’s physician has been excluded.[258] And in\r\nMichigan and Missouri it seems that testamentary cases are no exception\r\nto the general rule.[259]\r\n\r\n_Lunacy and Habitual Drunkenness._—It has been claimed in New York\r\nthat inquisitions of lunacy are an exception, and recently it has been\r\nheld that the alleged lunatic’s physician may testify as to his mental\r\ncondition because no one is better qualified to testify,[260] but this\r\ndecision seems to be at variance with the principle of the decisions\r\nof the Court of Appeals with reference to testamentary cases, and\r\npresents no satisfactory reason for a distinction. In a similar case in\r\nthe Supreme Court, Chambers, it was held that a medical attendant at an\r\nasylum could not testify.[261] It has also been held that a physician\r\ncannot make an affidavit as to the appearance and condition of his\r\npatient to support a petition for the appointment of a committee for\r\nhim as an habitual drunkard.[262]\r\n\r\n_Fraud._—Still another class of actions in which contending principles\r\nhave been invoked to make an exception in the law of privilege, is\r\nactions on life-insurance contracts. The contract of insurance is\r\n_uberrimæ fidei_, and the defence of fraud in the application is\r\nfrequently interposed to defeat a claim under a policy. Medical\r\ntestimony would often be the most satisfactory evidence to establish\r\nthe fraud, and efforts have been made to introduce it under that\r\nexcuse, but without avail. In the case of Dilleber _vs._ Home Life\r\nInsurance Company, in the Supreme Court of New York at General\r\nTerm,[263] the question seems to have been directly before the\r\ncourt, and Davis, P. J., dissenting, insisted that the suppression\r\nof a physician’s testimony ought not to be permitted so as to cover\r\nup a fraud, but the majority of the court held otherwise; the case\r\nwas subsequently overruled, but not on the ground urged by Justice\r\nDavis.[264] The number of insurance cases in which the rule has been\r\nenforced seems to leave it beyond question that it will not be relaxed\r\nfor the purpose of establishing fraud,[265] although that announcement\r\nhas not been specifically made. There seems no reason that the rule\r\nshould be relaxed in that regard when it is not relaxed to establish\r\nthe crime of the patient; though the mischief that may be done in such\r\ncases is apparent.[266]\r\n\r\n_The Witness._—The statutory provisions as to the professional\r\nstatus of the witness whose testimony is excluded have already been\r\nshown.[267] The facts which establish the relation of physician\r\nand patient will be treated later.[268] The witness is a member of\r\na profession, but there is very little discussion in the cases as\r\nto what constitutes a physician or surgeon.[269] The language of\r\nthe statutes as well as their policy and intent has been said to\r\nplainly embrace a physician who casually or in any way attends and\r\nprescribes for a patient, whether he be a family physician or the usual\r\nmedical attendant or not.[270] The spirit of the acts would protect\r\ncommunications made to any person attending the patient in the accepted\r\ncapacity of physician or surgeon wherever that might have happened,\r\nthough the letter would confine it in some instances to duly authorized\r\nor duly licensed persons. It does not seem to have been established\r\nwhether such authority or license must have been granted under the\r\nlaws of the State where the trial is conducted, nor how the several\r\nstatutes apply to communications made elsewhere, especially in States\r\nor countries where authority or license to practise is not required by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIt has been said with reference to the New York law that it is\r\nabsolutely necessary that the witness should be a _duly qualified_\r\nphysician;[271] and it has been held that the words “duly authorized”\r\nmean those persons who are not prohibited by the penal code from\r\npractising, so that an unlicensed physician may be compelled to\r\ndisclose confidential communications.[272] Whether the same rule would\r\nbe applied with reference to information obtained in another State by\r\na physician duly authorized to practise there although prohibited from\r\npractising in New York, is a question that is suggested as a case\r\nwithin the reason of the law but outside of its letter, and one which\r\ndoes not seem to have been answered.\r\n\r\nIn New York, in an action by a physician for compensation for his\r\nservices, it was held that a person who merely answered for a physician\r\nat his office in his absence, and was not himself a physician, is not a\r\nwitness whose testimony is privileged.[273]\r\n\r\nIn Missouri it has been held that a drug and prescription clerk is\r\nnot a privileged witness.[274] The question arose in the same State,\r\nwhether a dental surgeon is forbidden to testify under the statute, but\r\nits determination was not essential to the judgment and it was left\r\nunanswered.[275]\r\n\r\nTo establish the privilege it is necessary that the person who insists\r\nupon it to exclude testimony should show by competent evidence that the\r\nwitness belongs to the class privileged under the law.[276] But where\r\nthe physician testified that he was a regular practising physician and\r\nattended in that capacity, and he was not examined further as to his\r\ndue authority, it was held that a failure to produce his license could\r\nnot be urged on appeal as reason for compelling him to testify.[277]\r\nThe Court said that if the privilege were the physician’s he might, if\r\nthe objection were taken, be required to prove by the best evidence\r\nthat he was duly authorized, but as it is the patient’s privilege, in\r\nthe absence of objection to the sufficiency of the proof, the patient\r\nis entitled to the benefit of the presumption that the physician had\r\nthe license which the law requires to entitle him to practise.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIVER OF THE PRIVILEGE.\r\n\r\n_Who may Waive._—Those States in which the law provides for a waiver\r\nhave been enumerated;[278] in others the courts have determined that\r\nthe privilege of waiving is implied in the reason for the law. In\r\nIndiana it has been held that although the statute contains in terms\r\nan absolute prohibition, it creates no absolute incompetency and\r\nthe privilege may be waived by the person for whose benefit it is\r\nmade or his legal representative.[279] Under the Michigan law it\r\nwas claimed that the physician is forbidden to reveal confidences\r\neven though he have his patient’s consent, but it has been held that\r\nthe law only creates a privilege on the same footing with other\r\nprivileged communications, which the public has no interest in\r\nsuppressing when there is no desire for suppression on the part of\r\nthe person concerned.[280] In Missouri too the patient may waive the\r\nprivilege.[281]\r\n\r\nThe protection vouchsafed by the law is designed for the benefit of the\r\npatient, and therefore the physician himself cannot waive it.[282] The\r\npatient can disclose his own physical condition if he so desires.[283]\r\n\r\nBut the physician cannot refuse to testify if the patient waives the\r\nprivilege.[284]\r\n\r\nThe patient can waive the privilege during his life.[285]\r\n\r\nAs it existed prior to 1891 the New York law provided that the\r\nprohibition should operate unless it was expressly waived upon the\r\ntrial or examination by the patient.[286] This was interpreted to mean\r\nthat the patient himself was the only person who could make a waiver;\r\nand that, therefore, the possibility of waiver ceased with the death\r\nof the patient, while the privilege of secrecy continued unabated,\r\nso that those claiming under the deceased patient could not waive\r\nthe privilege, nor insist upon the testimony of the physician, even\r\nthough their interests were in jeopardy on account of his silence.[287]\r\nIt seems, however, that a patient can during his lifetime waive the\r\nprivilege, the waiver to take effect after his death.[288] The express\r\nwaiver required by the statute may be given by the patient’s attorney,\r\nbecause of the nature of the attorney’s agency in conducting an action\r\nfor the patient.[289]\r\n\r\nNone of the other statutes are in the exact terms of the New York\r\nstatute, but those of California, Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana,\r\nNevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington,\r\nand Wyoming provide that the testimony shall not be given unless the\r\n_patient_ consent; in Iowa, the waiver provided for is that of the\r\n_person_ in whose favor the prohibition is made; and in Nebraska, of\r\nthe _party_ in whose favor the provision is enacted.\r\n\r\nIn Indiana, the privilege extends beyond the death of the patient, and\r\nit may be waived by the party who may be said to stand in the place of\r\nthe deceased and whose interests may be affected by the disclosure.[290]\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, what the patient may do in his lifetime, those who\r\nrepresent him after his death may also do for the protection of\r\nthe interests which they claim under him.[291] In Missouri the\r\nrepresentatives of the patient may waive;[292] and where the dispute\r\nis between devisees and heirs at law all claiming under a deceased\r\npatient, either the devisees or heirs may call the attending physician\r\nof the testator as a witness regarding information acquired by him in\r\nhis professional attendance.[293] In Nevada it has been said that the\r\nparents of a seven-year-old infant, may waive for the infant.[294]\r\n\r\n_Objections to the Admission of Privileged Communications; When and\r\nby Whom Made._—Having considered who can waive the privilege, it\r\nis material to discuss also the question who may insist upon the\r\nenforcement of the law. If the protection were only enforced on the\r\nclaim of privilege by the patient, the very object of the statutes\r\nwould be defeated in the large majority of instances because of the\r\nabsence of the patient and every one interested in his behalf to\r\nassert his right. It rests, therefore, with any party to raise the\r\nobjection and assert the prohibition. But it seems that the physician\r\nhimself, unless a party, cannot make the objection.[295] It seems to\r\nhave been thought in some of the cases that the right to insist upon\r\nthe enforcement of the law is coupled with an interest derived from\r\nthe patient. This idea started from the language used in the early\r\ncases enforcing the privilege at the instance of those claiming under\r\ndeceased patients;[296] and it led to some confusion where the right\r\nof representatives to waive the privilege was denied; but it seems\r\nto be clear that the right to object differs from the right to waive\r\nin that the latter is necessarily and logically dependent upon the\r\nrelation between the patient and his representative, while the former\r\nis obviously suggested as the best method of enforcing the law. In\r\nIndiana it has been said that the statute gives to the representative\r\nof a deceased patient the right to object;[297] but that this is not\r\nby reason of the relationship appears from another case in the same\r\nState, where on an application for a new trial the Court voluntarily\r\nrefused to grant one for newly discovered evidence disclosed to it\r\nby a physician’s affidavit, on the ground that if the patient should\r\nobject in the new trial the evidence would be excluded.[298] In this\r\nState it has been held that the widow of the patient cannot object to\r\nthe disclosure, if his administrator with the will annexed waives the\r\nprivilege.[299]\r\n\r\nIn Michigan it has been said that the physician cannot avail himself\r\nof the statute for his own benefit; but that was in a case where the\r\ncommunication was not really of the privileged class.[300] In New\r\nYork, in proceedings to which a physician was a party an examination\r\nof his books of account before trial has been refused on the ground of\r\nprivilege, and for the same reason a motion to direct a physician to\r\nturn his books of account over to a receiver has been denied.[301]\r\n\r\nIn Montana it has been said that when the patient consents no one else\r\ncan object to the reception of the physician’s testimony.[302]\r\n\r\nIn New York it has been said that the benefits of the law are to be\r\ndispensed alike to those familiar with and those ignorant of its\r\nexistence and applicability, and it is therefore no reason to refuse\r\nits enforcement, that the patient did not know that his communication\r\nwas privileged.[303]\r\n\r\nBut, as in other cases of the receipt of improper evidence, it would\r\nseem that the objection should be made at the time it is offered, and\r\nif the objection is not then made, it will not avail to raise it later\r\nor on appeal.[304] It should not be prematurely made.[305] In New\r\nYork where in pursuance of a special feature of practice in probate\r\nproceedings,[306] certain witnesses are regarded as the surrogate’s\r\nwitnesses though produced at the instance of the contestant, and the\r\ncontestant, after giving notice that the evidence of physicians as such\r\nwitnesses was material, refused to examine them, and the surrogate\r\nrequired the proponent to suggest a line of examination, it was held\r\nthat it did not lie with the contestant to object to the physicians’\r\ntestimony as privileged, because she had lost her right to object by\r\ngiving notice that the evidence of those witnesses on these points was\r\nmaterial.[307]\r\n\r\nObjection cannot be raised in the progress of an examination after the\r\nforbidden testimony has been in part received without objection; for\r\nthat would unjustly enable a party to open the door and get in all he\r\ndesired and then to close it to the disadvantage of his adversary; when\r\nthe door is once properly opened the examination may be continued until\r\nit is complete, despite the objection of the party at whose instance it\r\nwas begun.[308]\r\n\r\nIn Indiana, where there was no objection, it was held that the evidence\r\nshould not be withdrawn from the consideration of the jury or its\r\nweight diminished by comments on its value as matter of law.[309]\r\n\r\nBut when such evidence has already been admitted in the face of\r\nobjection, it is not necessary for the party to object again, as\r\nnothing is waived by conforming with a rule already laid down.[310]\r\nWhere it is apparent that no harm is done to the objecting party by an\r\nimproper ruling on the receipt of privileged communications, no weight\r\nwill be given to an exception to such ruling.[311]\r\n\r\n_What Constitutes a Waiver of the Privilege._—The statutory provisions\r\nas to what constitutes a waiver have been set forth above.[312] In\r\nCalifornia it has been held that cross-examination of the physician\r\nby the patient, calling for privileged matter, is a waiver of\r\nprivilege.[313] In Indiana it has been held that consent to disclosure\r\ncannot be inferred from the patient’s simply giving the name of his\r\nfamily physician in applying for a policy of insurance on his life,\r\nand that a waiver in such an application should be evidenced by a\r\nstipulation too plain to be misunderstood.[314] And a physician’s\r\nstatements of the cause of his patient’s death, furnished to an\r\ninsurance company, in pursuance of a stipulation of a policy that\r\nsatisfactory proof of death shall be submitted to the company, are not\r\nrendered admissible by that stipulation.[315]\r\n\r\nIt has also been held that consent to the evidence of one physician\r\nis no consent that another physician may divulge confidential\r\ncommunications;[316] and that the physician cannot testify that he\r\nfound no evidence of injury on the examination of his patient, in\r\norder to contradict her;[317] the patient had already testified as\r\nto her condition and what the physician had done, but not as to\r\nanything said to her by her physician; she had expressly declined\r\nto testify concerning communications except as to his prescription\r\nfor her injury, and without asking him to disprove her assertions\r\nthe trial Court permitted him to say that he had found no evidence\r\nof injury; this was held to be error. It has also been held that the\r\ntaking of a physician’s deposition and filing it, for the purpose\r\nof breaking the force of his testimony in a deposition taken by the\r\nopposite party, is no consent in itself to the reading of the other\r\nparty’s deposition.[318] But when, in an action against a physician for\r\nmalpractice, the patient testifies as to the manner of treatment, the\r\nphysician is then at liberty to introduce the testimony of himself or\r\nanother physician as to the facts thus put in issue by the patient.[319]\r\n\r\nIn Iowa it has been held that the testimony of a patient regarding the\r\ncondition of his health is not a waiver of privilege, so as to allow\r\nhis opponent to introduce the testimony of his physician to contradict\r\nhim.[320]\r\n\r\nIn Michigan a physician has been allowed to contradict his patient as\r\nto the time when her trouble commenced, but on the ground that it had\r\nnot been shown that the information was necessary to enable him to\r\nprescribe.[321] But it has been held that waiver as to one physician is\r\nnot waiver as to another regarding a different time.[322]\r\n\r\nIn Missouri, the calling of a physician by the patient as a witness\r\nto testify as to information acquired while attending, is a\r\nwaiver.[323] But offering one physician as a witness is not a waiver\r\nof the privilege with reference to another.[324] An applicant for\r\ninsurance may, by an express waiver in his application, make an\r\nefficient waiver, binding upon any one claiming under the contract of\r\ninsurance.[325]\r\n\r\nIn Nevada a waiver has been implied from the testimony of the patient\r\nand her mother, where the patient was an infant seven years of\r\nage.[326] And it was said that the parents of such an infant may make\r\nthe waiver.\r\n\r\nIn New York it has been held that reference to a family physician\r\nwhen answering questions on an application for insurance, is not a\r\nwaiver;[327] nor is the presence of a third person, in aid of the\r\npatient;[328] nor is the bringing of an action for damages for an\r\ninjury;[329] nor is the examination of the physician in a former trial\r\nby the opposing party;[330] but where the ban of secrecy is once\r\nremoved in an action and the information once lawfully made public, at\r\nthe instance of the patient, it cannot be restored, and the disclosure\r\nmay then be compelled in any subsequent action;[331] it would seem,\r\ntoo, that a physician who becomes a witness to his patient’s last\r\nwill and testament at the patient’s request is then subject to a\r\nthorough examination on all points involving the patient’s testamentary\r\ncapacity.[332]\r\n\r\nWhere the patient testified herself and called an attending physician\r\nto prove her physical condition, this was not a consent to the\r\nexamination of another attending physician, and it was said that the\r\nopposite party by tactics on cross-examination could not compel the\r\npatient to abandon a privilege which she refused to waive.[333] Fish,\r\nJ., in delivering the opinion of the Court in the last-mentioned case,\r\nsaid of the operation of the statute, that it allows the patient to\r\nuse the testimony of the attending physician if he thinks his evidence\r\nwill benefit his case, and to object and exclude it in case he thinks\r\nit will not benefit him; he may call to his aid the testimony of any\r\none whose views he approves and exclude that of another whose testimony\r\nmight tend to controvert that given with the consent of the patient;\r\nthat in this case the excluded witness was the best witness and could\r\ntell nothing else than the patient had disclosed if she had told the\r\ntruth and it would relate solely to what she and the other physician\r\nhad described, but that the Court could not consider whether the\r\nstatute tended to promote the cause of justice, and he distinguished\r\n_McKinney v. Grand Street Railroad Company_,[334] on the ground that\r\nthere the consent had been that the same physician should disclose what\r\nhe knew, while here the waiver of the excluded physician’s testimony\r\nhad been constantly withheld.\r\n\r\nA decision which seems to be at variance with _Record v. Village of\r\nSaratoga Springs_ is _Treanor v. Manhattan Railway Company_,[335] where\r\nit was said that the patient cannot promulgate and uncover his maladies\r\nand infirmities in court and keep his physician under obligations to\r\nsilence, and that he cannot, to mulct another in damages, inflame a\r\njury with a false or exaggerated story of his injuries and sufferings\r\nand preclude the physician from making a truthful statement of the case.\r\n\r\nBut where the patient testifies as to what passed between him and his\r\nphysician, the physician may testify on the same subject, as a waiver\r\nis inferred from the circumstances; for the reason, that the patient,\r\nhaving gone into the privileged domain to get evidence on his own\r\nbehalf, cannot prevent the other party from assailing such evidence\r\nby the only testimony available, and the rule is no longer applicable\r\nwhen the patient himself pretends to give the circumstances of the\r\nprivileged interview.[336] The requirement that a physician file with\r\na board of health a certificate of the cause of death does not abrogate\r\nthe privilege in a judicial proceeding.[337]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVIDENCE EXCLUDED.\r\n\r\n“_Information._”—In Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan,\r\nMinnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, North\r\nDakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin the\r\nprivileged matter is characterized as _information_.[338]\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas it seems that the information must be a _confidential\r\ncommunication_;[339] but in the other States where it has been\r\nnecessary to construe the word it has received a broader interpretation.\r\n\r\nIn Michigan _information_ is not confined to confidential\r\ncommunications made by the patient, but includes whatever in order to\r\nenable a physician to prescribe was disclosed to any of his senses and\r\nwhich in any way was brought to his knowledge for that purpose;[340]\r\nit covers a letter written to a physician,[341] and matters observed\r\nby him;[342] but it does not include information acquired by a third\r\nperson; for instance, the time when a physician saw his patient\r\nmay be disclosed by her mother;[343] and the fact of treatment or\r\nnon-treatment is not _information_;[344] nor are the facts that the\r\nphysician was the patient’s family physician, and that he attended him\r\nprofessionally; nor are statements of the dates of such attendance and\r\nthe number of such visits;[345] nor the facts that the physician has\r\nbeen called upon to examine and prescribe for a person and that his\r\npatient had told him that she would want him to testify for her in a\r\nlawsuit.[346]\r\n\r\nIn Missouri the statute protects information received _from the\r\npatient_; but this is not confined to oral communications, and includes\r\nknowledge gained by inspection of the patient’s person.[347] In _Lunz\r\nv. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company_ protection was said not\r\nto extend to information of this sort apparent on casual inspection,\r\nwhich any one might make, nor to symptoms which are obvious before\r\nthe patient submits himself to any examination, such as an inflamed\r\nface, a bloodshot eye, alcoholic fumes, or delirium; nor to facts\r\nso superficial that in regard to them no confidence could have been\r\nreposed. But this distinction between hidden and patent facts is\r\ndisapproved in _Kling v. City of Kansas_,[348] and the statement is\r\nmade that the law does not rest on the confidence imposed. Knowledge\r\nor communications concerning the cause of a patient’s condition and\r\nthe extent of his injuries have also been held to be included in the\r\nterm information, because the disclosure of these matters involved\r\nthe indirect disclosure of the condition;[349] but it was said that\r\nthe physician may testify as to knowledge acquired independent of\r\ncommunications from the patient and of examination or inspection\r\nmade by the witness for the purpose of treatment.[350] As divulging\r\nprivileged information, a physician has not been allowed to answer\r\nwhat his patient’s hurts were, why he left a hospital, or whether\r\nhe required longer treatment;[351] and it has also been held that a\r\nphysician cannot give his opinion as to the mental condition of his\r\npatient based upon privileged knowledge.[352]\r\n\r\nIn New York _information_ comprehends all knowledge acquired by the\r\nphysician by communication, observation, or inspection;[353] it\r\nhas been said to extend to all facts which necessarily come to the\r\nknowledge of the physician in a given professional case;[354] and it\r\nincludes as well the opinion of the physician based upon his knowledge\r\nas the knowledge itself.[355]\r\n\r\nThe physician cannot disclose the nature of his patient’s disease,\r\nwhether he learned it by observation or examination or from what his\r\npatient told him;[356] nor can he testify as to what he told his\r\npatient.[357] In _Edington v. Ætna Life insurance Company_[358] it\r\nwas said by Judge Earl that the statute was aimed at confidential\r\ncommunications and secret ailments, and that it did not extend to\r\nmatters superficially apparent, such as a fever, a fractured leg\r\nor skull, or raving mania apparent to all;[359] but this view was\r\ndisapproved expressly in the later case of _Renihan v. Dennin_.[360]\r\n\r\nThe privileged information has been said to include knowledge acquired\r\nthrough the statements of others surrounding the patient.[361] But\r\nit would seem that the fact that a third person was present during a\r\nphysician’s visit may be shown by the physician, as well as what passed\r\nbetween the patient and the third person, if it was such information\r\nas a layman would have gathered.[362] The information from the third\r\nperson regarding the patient is protected even though the patient be\r\nabsent;[363] but not if the third person does not employ the physician,\r\nand the information thus acquired is not necessary to enable the\r\nphysician to act in a professional capacity.[364] It is suggested in\r\none case, but not determined, that it would be improper for a physician\r\nto state the value of the services of a nurse in attendance upon his\r\npatient, as that would involve a consideration of the condition of his\r\npatient;[365] but it has been held that a physician can testify to the\r\nfact of a nurse’s services.[366]\r\n\r\nBut it is information regarding the patient that is privileged, and\r\ntherefore a physician may disclose what his patient told him about\r\nanother, even though the subject of inquiry be the attitude of the\r\npatient toward the other;[367] and likewise the physician may disclose\r\nwhat he told his patient about a third person;[368] so also the\r\nphysician may testify as to family events in no way connected with\r\nphysical complaints.[369] It has been held, too, that admissions\r\nmade by a patient to his physician, tending to show contributory\r\nnegligence on the part of the patient, at a time when the communication\r\ncould not well have been made to enable the physician to prescribe,\r\nnamely, on the physician’s third and last visit, may be proven by the\r\nphysician.[370]\r\n\r\nThe physician may properly testify that he did attend as\r\nphysician,[371] and that the patient was sick, and he can state when\r\nand how often he attended him,[372] and whether his knowledge was\r\nacquired while in professional attendance,[373] but it is open to the\r\nCourt to determine from the evidence whether it was so acquired.[374]\r\n\r\n“_Matter Committed._”—In Indiana the protection covers _matter\r\ncommitted_. It would seem that the use of the word _committed_\r\nimplies confidence and that the protected matter is only confidential\r\ncommunications; but an earlier statute in that State applied to\r\n“matters confided,” and it was held to cover matters learned by\r\nobservation or examination, or by communication from the patient,\r\nwhether learned under an injunction of secrecy, express or implied,\r\nor not;[375] and it has been held that the present law forbids the\r\ndisclosure of matters learned in a sick-room, no matter how the\r\nknowledge may have been acquired.[376]\r\n\r\n“_Confidential Communications._”—The laws of Iowa and Nebraska protect\r\nconfidential communications properly intrusted. The construction\r\nput upon the word _confided_ in Indiana has been shown. In Iowa it\r\nhas been said that a confidential inquiry for advice to facilitate\r\nthe commission of a crime or the infraction of law, is not properly\r\nintrusted and is not privileged;[377] but where the advice is sought\r\nfor a purpose which may or may not be lawful, the presumption is that\r\nit is lawful, and the communication is privileged.[378] It has been\r\nsaid that whether or not a physician treated a person for a particular\r\ndisease, is not a confidential communication.[379]\r\n\r\nThe word confidential is not narrowly construed, for a physician has\r\nbeen prevented from disclosing whether his patient said that a car\r\nwas in motion when he was injured, because the injury would be more\r\nsevere if in motion;[380] and the fact that the physician’s partner was\r\npresent does not remove the seal of secrecy, or permit the partner to\r\ntestify.[381]\r\n\r\n“_Communications._”—In Ohio and Wyoming _communications_ are\r\nprivileged; and in Kansas and Oklahoma communications with reference\r\nto a physical or supposed physical disease and any knowledge obtained\r\nby a personal examination of a patient. It does not appear whether a\r\nnarrower construction would be given to the term _communications_ than\r\nto the term _information_; but it would seem not, if a person deprived\r\nof speech is to be protected,[382] or if the term _communications_ is\r\nnot to be construed as meaning _oral communications_.\r\n\r\n“_From the Patient; by the Patient._”—The former qualifying terms\r\nare used in the statutes of Arkansas, Indian Territory, and Missouri;\r\nthe latter in the statutes of Kansas and Oklahoma. The liberal\r\ninterpretation put upon this term in the Missouri law has already\r\nbeen shown.[383] The law of the Indian Territory is adopted from\r\nArkansas.[384] The statute is strictly construed in Arkansas,[385] but\r\nthis term does not seem to have received interpretation.\r\n\r\n“_Advice._”—The laws of Indiana, Ohio, and Wyoming expressly cover the\r\nphysician’s advice. In New York it is incompetent for the physician\r\nto disclose what he told his patient;[386] but advice to a patient\r\nconcerning a third person is not privileged.[387]\r\n\r\n_The Relation of Physician and Patient._—Under each of the statutes,\r\nthe relation of physician and patient must have existed at the time\r\nthe information was acquired. In those cases where the relation is\r\nestablished by contract and is recognized by both physician and patient\r\nas existing, no difficulty arises in determining that it does exist.\r\nIt is in those cases where some one of these elements is lacking that\r\nthe difficulties are met. In California it has been held that the\r\nrelation exists where a physician attends and prescribes for a person,\r\nnotwithstanding he was employed by another, who seeks to disclose\r\nthe evidence.[388] In Michigan, where the physician was employed by\r\ndirection of the prosecuting attorney to examine the defendant in jail,\r\nand so notified the defendant at the outset of the examination, and\r\nhe submitted voluntarily to a personal examination, and there was no\r\nintention to prescribe or to act as the defendant’s physician, it was\r\nheld that the relation did not exist, and that the physician could\r\ntestify as to the defendant’s physical condition.[389]\r\n\r\nIn one New York case it has been said that the relation is one\r\nof contract, and that the test is whether the physician would be\r\nchargeable with malpractice or negligence for failure to advise or\r\nprescribe in case the alleged patient were in urgent need of it at\r\nthe time.[390] But the decisions of the Court of Appeals extend\r\nthe privilege to cases where this test would lead to a different\r\nconclusion.[391]\r\n\r\nWhere the physician to a county jail was called in to attend a\r\nprisoner and examined him, though there was no prescription at the\r\ntime, but it appeared that the doctor told the prisoner what he should\r\nprescribe, and subsequently two physicians came to see the prisoner\r\nat the instance of the coroner and examined him as they would have\r\nexamined one of their patients, though they did not prescribe and had\r\nno conversation about a prescription, it was held that the prisoner\r\nhad, under the circumstances, reason to suppose that the relation\r\nof physician and patient did exist between him and all three of the\r\nphysicians, and that their testimony as to what they learned on such\r\nvisits should have been excluded; and the rule is thus stated: whenever\r\nthe patient has reason to suppose that the relation exists and does in\r\nfact and truth so suppose, in a case where the physician attends under\r\ncircumstances calculated to induce the opinion that his visit is of a\r\nprofessional nature, and the visit is so regarded and acted upon by the\r\nperson attended, the relation of physician and patient contemplated by\r\nthe statute may fairly be said to exist.[392]\r\n\r\nBut the fact that it is the duty of a physician to prescribe for a\r\nperson in case of need, does not constitute the relation, though\r\nthe position of the physician gives him the opportunity to observe\r\nsuch person; so, therefore, a jail physician was not precluded from\r\ntestifying as to what he had observed of a prisoner, where it did not\r\nappear that he had ever attended the latter in a professional capacity\r\nor had ever been called on to attend him.[393]\r\n\r\nIt would seem, however, that where it is the duty of a physician to\r\nattend a person in a professional capacity or to acquire knowledge\r\nconcerning him in such capacity, he cannot disclose information\r\nactually acquired in the performance of his duty. It has been said\r\nthat a medical attendant at an insane asylum cannot testify as to the\r\nmental condition of an inmate;[394] and that a physician employed in a\r\nhospital to notice and enter in its records the arrival and condition\r\nof the patients coming in, cannot testify as to information so\r\nacquired.[395]\r\n\r\nIt is immaterial that another person employs the physician to examine\r\nthe patient, and to report to the employer, and that the person\r\nexamined does not appear to desire any knowledge as to his condition;\r\nif the examination is made as a professional act, the relation of\r\nphysician and patient is established between the physician and the\r\nperson examined, even though it be the only interview.[396]\r\n\r\nAnd in a case where the public prosecutor sent a physician to a person\r\nfor the purpose of making a professional examination, so as to obtain\r\nevidence against another person charged with crime, and the person\r\nexamined accepted the services of the physician in a professional\r\ncharacter, it was held that he could not testify as to the results of\r\nhis examination.[397]\r\n\r\nBut where the district attorney sent a physician to jail to make an\r\nexamination of a prisoner’s mental and physical condition, and he made\r\nsuch examination, and it did not appear that he prescribed for or\r\ntreated the prisoner or that the prisoner accepted his services, the\r\nopinion of the physician as to his mental condition was admitted.[398]\r\n\r\nWhere the defendant employed a physician to examine the plaintiff, and\r\nhe went as coming from the defendant for that purpose, and examined\r\nthe plaintiff in the presence of his attending physician, but not as\r\nthe plaintiff’s physician and not for the purpose of prescribing, the\r\nrelation of physician and patient was not established.[399] Where a\r\nphysician examined the plaintiff at the instance of the plaintiff’s\r\nphysician, but it was not shown that he was requested or expected\r\nto treat or prescribe or to advise in respect to either, or that he\r\ndid either, it was held that the relation was not established;[400]\r\nbut a physician consulted by the patient’s regular physician for the\r\npurpose of advice concerning his treatment is a physician contemplated\r\nby the statute;[401] as is also the partner of a physician who\r\nis present during a conference with the patient or who overhears\r\nsuch a conference.[402] Attendance at the patient’s house is not\r\ncontemplated as essential by the law, and it makes no difference\r\nwhere the examination is conducted.[403] But where the physician was\r\nalso a county clerk and the alleged patient was an attorney, and the\r\nconsultation took place in the clerk’s office and consisted of an\r\nexamination of an eruption on the skin, which was made gratuitously and\r\nwithout a prescription being made or asked for, the relation was held\r\nnot to have been established, notwithstanding that the clerk made use\r\nof his knowledge and learning as a physician in forming his opinion,\r\nand that it was in confidence that he possessed medical skill that the\r\nperson requested the examination.[404]\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that the relation once established continues always;\r\nthe secrecy growing out of the relationship, as to knowledge then\r\nacquired, always continues unless properly waived; and the physician\r\nwill not be allowed to testify in regard to matter which is partly the\r\nresult of such information, though another part may have been acquired\r\nindependent of the relation;[405] but where it is clear that the matter\r\ndesired is independent of the relation of physician and patient, such\r\nevidence is admissible if otherwise competent.[406]\r\n\r\n“_Professional Capacity._”—The States in which the statutes limit\r\nthe privilege to information acquired in a professional capacity\r\nhave been enumerated.[407] As to what constitutes a professional\r\ncapacity, the discussion of the facts that establish the relation of\r\nphysician and patient, and of the information necessary to enable a\r\nphysician to prescribe or a surgeon to act, makes it unnecessary to\r\ndiscuss at length the meaning of this phrase. The decision in _Lunz\r\nv. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company_[408] would make it\r\nappear that in Missouri information apparent on a casual inspection\r\nwhich any one might make is not received in a professional capacity,\r\nbut this idea is disapproved in the later case of _Kling v. City of\r\nKansas_.[409] Information acquired by the physician by observing the\r\npatient on the street anterior to his employment as a physician is not\r\nreceived by him in a professional capacity.[410]\r\n\r\nIn New York, where the physician had not seen the patient before or\r\nsince his interview for the purpose of treatment, and he was asked\r\nwhat his opinion was, based on a general sight of the man before the\r\nexamination, it was held that the physician could not properly answer,\r\nas all the information upon which the opinion would be based must\r\nhave been acquired in a professional capacity;[411] but in another\r\ncase a physician was permitted to express his opinion as to the mental\r\ncondition of a patient whom he had seen at various times when not\r\nin attendance, excluding from his mind any knowledge or information\r\nobtained while acting as her medical attendant and confining his answer\r\nto such knowledge and information as he had obtained by seeing her when\r\nnot his patient.[412] It has been said that where information is not\r\nsuch as is obtained on sight by any person, but by removing clothing\r\nand by percussion and listening to the action of the lungs, these are\r\nprofessional acts and the information may be considered as obtained\r\nprofessionally.[413] It has been said that information received in a\r\nprofessional capacity involves a decision, though it may be negative;\r\nand that signing as witness to a will is not a professional act.[414]\r\n\r\n_Matter Necessary to Enable a Physician to Prescribe or a Surgeon to\r\nAct._—A list of those States whose laws limit the privilege to matter\r\nnecessary to enable the witness to prescribe or act for the patient is\r\nto be found in another place.[415]\r\n\r\nIn Arkansas, where six hours after delivery, the patient stated to her\r\nphysician who attended at accouchement, that she had never been engaged\r\nto marry and never had promised to marry, the statements were held not\r\nto be necessary to enable the physician to act.[416]\r\n\r\nIn Iowa, a physician who had treated a patient for injuries was not\r\nallowed to testify whether his patient told him that the car on which\r\nhe was injured was in motion at the time, because as the injury would\r\nbe likely to be more severe if the car was in motion, that information\r\nwas necessary to enable the physician to prescribe.[417]\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, a physician was allowed to contradict his patient as\r\nto when her trouble commenced, in the absence of evidence that\r\nsuch information was necessary to enable him to act.[418] Where a\r\nphysician was asked whether he treated a person for typhoid fever,\r\nand he answered that she was not so diseased, it was held that this\r\ninformation was not necessary to enable him to act.[419] And the same\r\nwas held to be true where a physician examined a prisoner at the jail\r\nand testified that he was diseased, the prisoner having been notified\r\nat the time of the examination that it was made by direction of the\r\nprosecuting attorney and there being no intention to prescribe or act\r\nfor the prisoner.[420] But it has been stated that all disclosures by\r\na patient to a physician respecting ailments are privileged whether\r\nnecessary to enable the physician to prescribe or not.[421]\r\n\r\nIn Minnesota, a physician was allowed to disclose statements as to\r\nsuffering made by his patient, but not for the purpose of enabling him\r\nto prescribe or act.[422]\r\n\r\nIn Missouri, it has been said that information as to the way in which\r\nan injury was inflicted is of the greatest necessity for successful\r\ntreatment; and that it is information which physicians universally\r\ndemand and receive.[423] In another case, with reference to the cause\r\nof a patient’s condition, it was said that while knowledge of the\r\ncause may not be necessary, the disclosure of the cause cannot be made\r\nwithout a disclosure of the condition, and that as a medical person\r\ncannot tell indirectly what he is forbidden to tell directly, the\r\nphysician’s evidence of the cause is inadmissible.[424] In another case\r\nit was said that any information, necessarily coming to a physician in\r\norder to treat his patient, is to be regarded as necessary information\r\nthough unimportant, and that the test is how it was acquired, not\r\nwhether it could have been acquired in a different way, and therefore\r\nit was incompetent for a physician to testify that his patient was\r\ndrunk when he treated him.[425]\r\n\r\nIn New York, in an early case,[426] where a man consulted a physician\r\nwith reference to committing an abortion and told him that a certain\r\nwoman was pregnant by him, this admission was said not to be essential\r\nto enable him to prescribe, even if the relation of physician and\r\npatient were considered established; but this seems to be at variance\r\nwith the later case of _People v. Brower_,[427] where the accused\r\nconsulted a physician with reference to the treatment of a woman on\r\nwhom he had attempted to commit an abortion, and admitted that he\r\nhad done so, and the physician was not permitted to disclose it.\r\nA broader view is now taken of the word _necessary_. It has been\r\nheld by the Court of Appeals that a physician could not testify\r\nthat his patient had a venereal disease while under his care as a\r\nphysician, the presumption being that he learned it for the purpose of\r\nprescribing;[428] and again, that it is assumed from the relationship\r\nthat the information would not have been imparted except for the\r\npurpose of aiding the physician to prescribe.[429] But this presumption\r\ndoes not attach to information regarding a patient, communicated by a\r\nthird person.[430]\r\n\r\nWhere a person went to a physician to call for medicine, and\r\nit appeared that he was not consulting for himself and was not\r\nrepresenting any one else who needed or desired medical assistance, the\r\nphysician was allowed to testify as to a conversation which took place\r\nat that time.[431]\r\n\r\nIn the case of _Edington v. Ætna Life Insurance Company_,[432] it was\r\nsaid that before the exclusion, the facts on which it is justified\r\nmust appear in some way, and the Court must know somewhat of the\r\ncircumstances; from the opinion it is easy to infer that it is only\r\nconfidential communications and information as to secret ailments which\r\nmay be regarded as necessary within the statute; but this view was\r\noverruled in _Grattan v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company_,[433]\r\nand there it was distinctly stated that it is enough that the witness\r\nacquired the information in his character as physician and in the due\r\nand proper exercise of his calling, and that it is not incumbent on\r\nthe person objecting, to show by formal proof that the information\r\nwas necessary to enable the witness to prescribe. In this case the\r\nexamination of the witness was as to the cause of his patient’s\r\ndeath, and the argument urged upon the attention of the Court was that\r\ninformation regarding the cause of death could not be necessary to\r\nenable the physician to prescribe, as the utility of the prescription\r\nceased with the death and before the cause was determined; but the\r\nCourt held that the privilege attached, because, although the death was\r\nthe result of the cause, the facts constituting the cause were learned\r\nwhile the physician was attending the living patient in a professional\r\ncapacity and from the symptoms manifested at that time.\r\n\r\nIn consonance with the decision in _Grattan v. Metropolitan Life\r\nInsurance Company_,[434] it has been held that a physician who\r\namputated a patient’s leg could not testify as to its condition at the\r\ntime it was amputated.[435]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the physician does not prescribe does not defeat the\r\nprivilege; if the information is acquired in the course of professional\r\nemployment the statute operates, for the decision that neither advice\r\nnor medicine is needed is a professional act within the spirit of the\r\nlaw.[436] _Medicus optimus, medicamentum minimum_, is the maxim used in\r\nanother case to illustrate this point.[437]\r\n\r\nBut it cannot be predicated as matter of law that a physician cannot\r\nexclude from his consideration facts learned or opinions formed while\r\nattending as physician; therefore he can testify as to his opinion on\r\nhypothetical facts which might be deemed to relate to another person as\r\nwell as the patient; and where the physician testified that he could\r\nso form an opinion, his opinion of such assumptions was held to be\r\nadmissible in evidence as expert testimony.[438]\r\n\r\nBut it is not all information which will be presumed to have been\r\nnecessary to enable the physician to act; it seems that where the\r\nknowledge is such that it is evidently immaterial to the physician’s\r\ndecision, it will be admitted. Such a case is that of _Hoyt v.\r\nHoyt_,[439] where the testimony of physicians was admitted to show\r\nthe attitude of their patient toward his daughter and their advice\r\nto him concerning her, the evidence being for the purpose of showing\r\nthe testator’s opinion and not the physicians’. It has also been held\r\nthat a statement made by a patient on the physician’s last visit as\r\nto what occurred at the time the patient was injured, tending to show\r\ncontributory negligence, was not necessary information.[440] And a\r\nphysician’s evidence of the declaration of his patient as to making a\r\nwill and the doctor’s advice on that subject have been admitted.[441]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROVINCE OF THE COURT IN DEALING WITH THE PRIVILEGE.\r\n\r\nAll questions of the competency of evidence are solved by the Court\r\nand not by the jury.[442] The facts establishing the privilege are\r\npresented to the Court for its consideration. In Iowa it has been held\r\nthat a fair trial demands that it should not be made to appear to the\r\njury in an action that the patient is reluctant to waive his privilege,\r\nand that therefore the subject-matter of waiver has no place in the\r\ntaking of testimony except when introduced by the party permitted to\r\nmake it, and the Court should not allow the patient to be asked to\r\nanswer under oath whether he is willing to waive his privilege.[443]\r\n\r\nWhether it is the duty of the Court to enforce the privilege where it\r\nis apparent and the patient is not present to object, is a question\r\nthat seems to be variously regarded. In Indiana a court has refused\r\na new trial for newly discovered evidence of the privileged sort, on\r\nthe ground that if objection were madeon the new trial it would be\r\nrejected.[444] But where the evidence of a physician to contradict\r\nanother physician, who was witness to a will, was received without\r\nobjection, it was said that it should not be withdrawn by the Court\r\nfrom the consideration of the jury or its value commented on as matter\r\nof law.[445]\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, it has been said that a commissioner, whose ordinary duty\r\nis to take all evidence offered, should refuse to take this privileged\r\nevidence; and that it should be stricken out without motion by the\r\njudge when returned by the commissioner, and that the physician should\r\nnot be allowed to violate the privilege.[446] It has also been held\r\nthat an order for the compulsory physical examination of a person by\r\na physician for the purpose of testifying should not be granted, and\r\nthat evidence so obtained should be stricken out, but on the ground\r\nthat it was a violation of personal liberty, rather than of statutory\r\nprivilege.[447]\r\n\r\nBut in New York it has been held that where a person voluntarily in\r\nan action exhibits an injured part as evidence, the adverse party is\r\nentitled to follow it up by a personal or professional inspection of\r\nthe injured part.[448]\r\n\r\nIn Missouri, it has been said that the physician should be told that he\r\nis not at liberty to testify as to privileged information.[449]\r\n\r\nIn New York, in an early case in chancery, the chancellor said that\r\na master was wrong in supposing there was legal evidence before him,\r\nwhere a physician had given evidence privileged under the statute;[450]\r\nbut this decision was reversed on appeal, the Court of Errors saying\r\nthat as no objection was made before the master by a party, the\r\nevidence was competent and legal.[451] This question seems to have been\r\nsettled in New York by the decision in _Hoyt v. Hoyt_,[452] that the\r\nlaw does not prohibit the examination of a physician but it prohibits\r\nthe evidence being received in the face of objection, so that if no\r\nobjection is made by a party it is not the province of the Court to\r\nreject the evidence.\r\n\r\nWhere it appears that privileged information was improperly admitted,\r\nit is not ground for reversal on appeal if it is apparent that the\r\nappellant was not injured by its reception.[453]\r\n\r\nWhere the Court is not empowered to reject the evidence of its own\r\nmotion, the objection upon which it can reject is the objection of\r\na party to the suit, and doubtless of the patient, but not of the\r\nphysician.[454] But because of the privilege, it has been held that a\r\nphysician will not be ordered to turn over his books of account to a\r\nreceiver appointed in proceedings supplementary to an execution on a\r\njudgment against him.[455] Nor will examination of his books of account\r\nbefore trial be compelled.[456]\r\n\r\nIt is the province of the courts, however, to enforce the law and not\r\nto legislate by grafting exceptions upon it.[457] They have refused\r\ntherefore to except, by judicial decision, from the operation of the\r\nlaw, criminal proceedings, testamentary causes, evidence of crime in\r\ncivil actions, cases of lunacy and habitual drunkenness and fraud,[458]\r\nin all of which it was urged in argument without effect that the\r\nadministration of justice was impeded by the privilege; but where the\r\nspirit of the law was violated by an enforcement of its letter and\r\nthe privilege made a cloak to shield the murderer of the patient,\r\nit was held to be inapplicable.[459] The courts have also refused\r\nby mere judicial decision to limit the privilege to the life of the\r\npatient.[460]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF ENFORCING THE PRIVILEGE.\r\n\r\nThe courts are not warranted in admitting incompetent evidence in order\r\nto prevent the failure of justice by the exclusion of the privileged\r\ntestimony. A letter written by a physician is inadmissible as evidence\r\nof the privileged facts which it states;[461] and a certificate of\r\nthe cause of death, required by law to be signed by the physician and\r\nfiled, is not admissible to prove the cause of death in an action in\r\nwhich the physician cannot testify.[462]\r\n\r\nThe making of the objection does not raise a presumption against the\r\nperson making it.[463] In Iowa it has been held that the patient should\r\nnot be interrogated under oath as to whether or not he will waive his\r\nprivilege, for the jury ought not to be prejudiced against him by any\r\nshow of reluctance.[464] In Michigan, however, it has been held that a\r\npatient’s failure to produce his physician as a witness is a legitimate\r\nfact for the jury to consider.[465]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARACTER AND WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE TO SUSTAIN THE OBJECTION.\r\n\r\nWhere the objection is made, the burden of proof to establish the\r\ngrounds of privilege is upon the person objecting.[466] In Missouri\r\nit has been said that the statement of the physician, that he cannot\r\nseparate his impressions received in his relation of physician from\r\nthose received at other times, is not in itself sufficient to justify\r\nthe exclusion of his evidence; that the facts themselves must appear to\r\nthe Court, and it might be developed on proper cross-examination that\r\ndiscrimination could be made.[467]\r\n\r\nBut it would seem that because of the necessarily delicate nature of\r\nthe inquiry, to avoid disclosing what the statute forbids, the burden\r\nis overcome with slight evidence, and inferences and presumptions\r\nare freely indulged in aid of the privilege; for instance, where the\r\nphysician was not permitted to answer whether he did converse with\r\nhis patient about an injury, or whether he made an examination with\r\nreference to it, it was urged that the objection was prematurely made,\r\nbut it was held that the fact that the patient consulted a physician\r\non the occasion to which the inquiry related, when considered with the\r\nnature of the questions, justified the exclusion in the absence of\r\nother proof.[468] But the physician may testify that he did attend\r\nhis patient as physician;[469] and he may answer the question whether\r\nthe information was necessary to enable him to act in his professional\r\ncapacity;[470] for while his testimony on that point is not conclusive,\r\nand the Court uses its own judgment in reaching a determination, his\r\ntestimony is competent evidence.[471] He may also testify that a person\r\nwas ill and was his patient, that he attended as physician, and he can\r\nstate when he attended and how many times.[472]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that where the evidence justifies the conclusion that\r\ninformation regarding the patient is acquired while attending in a\r\nprofessional capacity, it is not essential to show by formal proof that\r\nthe information was necessary.[473]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PHYSICIAN WITH REFERENCE TO THE PRIVILEGE.\r\n\r\nThe privilege established by law is a rule of evidence, and not a\r\nregulation of a physician’s general conduct outside of a proceeding in\r\nwhich rules of evidence are applicable.[474] The courts have, however,\r\nnot hesitated to intimate that it is a physician’s duty to observe the\r\nsame secrecy in his general walk and conversation.[475]\r\n\r\nThe physician may testify as an expert on hypothetical questions\r\nsubmitted to him regarding facts which might be equally true of any\r\nother person than his patient, and excluding from his consideration\r\nprivileged knowledge.[476] And he may also testify as to matters\r\nwhich came to his knowledge before or after or independent of his\r\nemployment as physician,[477] or which were immaterial to his acting in\r\na professional capacity, and as to which his patient could have had no\r\nreasonable ground for believing that they were necessarily disclosed\r\nin order that the physician might so act.[478] It is the patient’s\r\nprivilege and not the physician’s; and, therefore, the physician is\r\nnot absolutely incompetent as a witness, and has no right to refuse to\r\ntestify.[479] But where he is a party he may object and then he will\r\nnot be forced to disclose his patient’s confidence.[480]\r\n\r\nIn Indiana it has been held that where the patient testifies in an\r\naction against his physician for malpractice the physician is then\r\nat liberty to testify or to introduce any other witness to testify\r\nconcerning the matters in controversy.[481]\r\n\r\nIn Michigan, a physician who was plaintiff in a libel suit was not\r\npermitted to insist upon the privilege to prevent the disclosure of his\r\nmaltreatment of his patient or what other physicians had discovered\r\nwith regard to it by visits to his patients.[482]\r\n\r\nThe measure of the physician’s exemption and liability in testifying\r\nis the language of the statute, and not his idea of his duty to his\r\npatient or the patient’s injunctions of confidence or secrecy.[483]\r\n\r\nIn some of the States there are statutory provisions entitling\r\nphysicians to sue for compensation for their professional\r\nservices.[484] The statutes regarding privileged communications are\r\nto be construed together with these. There seems to be no reason why\r\na physician’s right of action for his services and medicines should\r\nnot survive the prohibition of his evidence; but it would seem that\r\nhe cannot as a witness in such an action testify regarding privileged\r\nmatter. But he can prove it by other witnesses.[485]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESULT OF THE LEGISLATION.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless due to considerations of public policy that the\r\nstatutes changing the common-law rule have been enacted;[486] but\r\nthey have not proved an unalloyed benefit, and some of their features\r\nhave brought about conditions which in some cases have embarrassed\r\nthe administration of justice. The law in New York may be taken for\r\nillustration; it formerly cut off the safest means of ascertaining the\r\nmental condition and competency of a testator;[487] it now precludes a\r\nphysician from disclosing the condition of his patient who is a lunatic\r\nor habitual drunkard,[488] though it be the most satisfactory evidence;\r\nit shuts out much testimony tending to show fraud in insurance\r\ncases;[489] it precludes a physician from stating the cause of his\r\npatient’s death,[490] though there is no longer any secrecy connected\r\nwith it, for the law makes it the duty of the physician to make, for\r\nfiling with the local board of health, a certificate of the probable\r\ncause of the death of a patient.[491] It has been the subject of much\r\nadverse criticism,[492] but all such considerations are properly to be\r\naddressed to the legislature and not to the courts. It seems to be the\r\nmost far-reaching in its exclusion, and though it has been the longest\r\nin existence, was modified at the legislative sessions of 1891, 1892,\r\nand 1893, a fact which tends to show that there was sound reason in the\r\ncriticisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A SYNOPSIS OF THE LAWS\r\n\r\n  OF THE\r\n\r\n  SEVERAL STATES AND TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES OF\r\n  AMERICA, AND OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, AND\r\n  OF THE NORTH AMERICAN PROVINCES OF GREAT\r\n  BRITAIN, REGULATING THE PRACTICE\r\n  OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY,\r\n\r\n\r\n  PREPARED FROM THE LATEST STATUTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM A.

It is not intended to include provisions\r\nregulating apothecaries, druggists, chemists, and dentists, or the sale\r\nof drugs, medicines, and poisons; nor provisions for the organization\r\nand procedure of boards of medical examiners, except so far as they\r\nregulate the requirements demanded from applicants for permission to\r\npractise; nor provisions with reference to the duties of clerks or\r\nregistrars in the preparation and safe-keeping of records in their\r\ncare; nor those defining the duties of members of boards, and punishing\r\nthe misconduct of such members; nor those prescribing qualifications\r\nfor appointment to the public medical service; nor former laws not now\r\napplicable to candidates; nor regulations of the form of certificates\r\nor licenses, where the issuing of them is committed to some public\r\nfunctionary or body; nor provisions with reference to the powers and\r\ndisabilities of local institutions to confer diplomas or degrees, nor\r\nwith reference to medical students except as candidates for admission\r\nto practise. In the synopsis words of the masculine gender are\r\nuniformly used except when the law by its terms makes a distinction\r\nbetween men and women, in which case the distinction is indicated.]\r\n\r\n\r\nALABAMA.\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—The board of censors of the Medical Association of\r\nthe State of Alabama and the board of censors of the county medical\r\nsocieties in affiliation with the said association are boards of\r\nmedical examiners (Code 1887, s. 1,301). In the absence of such board\r\nof medical examiners in any county, the county commissioners may\r\nestablish a board of from three to seven physicians of good standing,\r\nresident in the county, whose authority shall terminate whenever a\r\nboard is organized in accordance with the constitution of and in\r\naffiliation with said association (_ib._, s. 1,296). Where the board\r\nof examiners is constituted as provided in sec. 1,296, it must issue a\r\nlicense to practise medicine in any one or more of its branches in the\r\ncounty, if on examination the applicant is found duly qualified, and is\r\nof good moral character (_ib._, s. 1,297).\r\n\r\nIn a county having only the medical board provided for in sec. 1,296,\r\na regular graduate of a medical college in the United States, having\r\na diploma, is entitled to practise medicine without a license, upon\r\nrecording his diploma in the office of the judge of probate of the\r\ncounty (_ib._, s. 1,298).\r\n\r\nA license issued by the last-mentioned board must be recorded in the\r\noffice of the judge of probate of the county (_ib._, s. 1,299). The\r\nlicense or diploma, after record, is evidence of authority; if the\r\noriginal be lost, a certified copy of the record is sufficient evidence\r\n(_ib._, s. 1,300). Without a certificate of qualification from the\r\nboard provided for in sec. 1,301, except as above provided, no person\r\ncan lawfully practise medicine in any of its branches or departments\r\nas a profession or means of livelihood (_ib._, s. 1,302). The standard\r\nof qualification, method or system, and subjects of examination are\r\nprescribed by the medical association of the State (_ib._, s. 1,303).\r\n\r\nThe board of medical examiners, on application, must examine an\r\napplicant for a certificate of qualification as a practitioner of\r\nmedicine, and if he be found qualified, and of good moral character\r\nmust issue a certificate (_ib._, s. 1,304).\r\n\r\nPhysicians having a license as above before the organization in a\r\ncounty of a board, are on application thereto entitled to a certificate\r\nwithout examination and to be registered as licensed practitioners of\r\nmedicine (_ib._, s. 1,305).\r\n\r\nThe certificate is a license throughout the State. It must be recorded\r\nin the office of the judge of probate of the county in which the person\r\nresides at the time of issue. Upon recording it, the judge must indorse\r\na certificate of record and sign it and affix the seal of the court\r\n(_ib._, s. 1,306). Such certificate, or, if lost, a certified copy of\r\nthe record, is evidence (_ib._, s. 1,307).\r\n\r\nPENALTY.—A contract for the services of a physician or surgeon is void\r\nunless he has authority to practise; proof of authority is not required\r\nat trial except on two days’ notice (_ib._, s. 1,318).\r\n\r\nPractising medicine or surgery without a certificate is a misdemeanor\r\nunder a penalty of a fine of from $25 to $100. This provision is not\r\napplicable to physicians practising medicine in Alabama in 1890, who\r\nare graduates of a respectable medical college and have complied with\r\nthe law by having their diplomas recorded by the judge of probate in\r\nthe county where they practise; nor to a physician who has practised in\r\nthe State for the past five years (Act 1890-91, c. 376); nor to women\r\npractising midwifery (Code 1887, s. 1,308).\r\n\r\nFEES.—The statutory fees are as follows:\r\n\r\nTo judge of probate, for record of diploma, or license or certificate,\r\n$1 (_ib._, s. 1,298, 1,299, 1,306).\r\n\r\nTo board of medical examiners, for examination, actual expenses (_ib._,\r\ns. 1,304).\r\n\r\n\r\nARIZONA.\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—It is unlawful for any person to practise medicine,\r\nsurgery, or other obstetrics unless he have a diploma regularly issued\r\nby a medical college lawfully organized under the laws of the State\r\nwherein it is located, or a license issued and authorized by a board\r\nof medical examiners under and by virtue of the laws of any State or\r\nTerritory. The diploma must state that the person named is qualified to\r\npractise medicine and surgery in all of its departments (Penal Code,\r\n1887, s. 617, as amended Act of April 11th, 1893).\r\n\r\nA diploma granted for moneyed consideration or other article of value\r\nalone, or revoked or cancelled by the college by which it was issued or\r\nby act of the legislature, is not a sufficient qualification (_ib._, s.\r\n618).\r\n\r\nEvery practitioner of medicine, surgery, or obstetrics must register in\r\nthe county recorder’s office his name, residence, and place of birth,\r\nand present his diploma or license, and the county recorder must make\r\na copy of it under the record of his name, residence, and place of\r\nbirth. The person registering must subscribe and verify an affidavit in\r\nwriting, annexed to the copy as transcribed, that he is the identical\r\nperson named in the diploma (_ib._, s. 619, as amended by Act of April\r\n11th, 1893).\r\n\r\nDEFINITION, EXCEPTION.—Any person is regarded as practising medicine\r\nwho professes publicly to be a physician or habitually prescribes for\r\nthe sick, or appends to his name “M.

The clerk must\r\ngive him a certificate of record, which may be attached to the diploma\r\n(_ib._, s. 3).\r\n\r\nIn all cases of doubt as to the reputability of a college, it is the\r\nduty of the clerk of the county court, when a diploma is offered for\r\nrecord, to make inquiry of the Secretary of the State where the said\r\ncollege exists as to its reputability and requirements for graduation,\r\nand if the said clerk shall find that the said college does not conform\r\nto the requirements of this article, he shall not receive the diploma\r\nand the holder shall not be allowed to practise in the State. The\r\naggrieved applicant may apply to the State board of medical examiners,\r\nwhose decision shall govern the clerk in his action (_ib._, s. 4).\r\n\r\nIf after recording any diploma it shall come to the knowledge of the\r\nclerk making the record, or any other judicial or executive officer of\r\nthe State, that the record was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation,\r\nit shall be his duty to institute before the said court of record\r\nproceedings to have such record reversed, and the holder of the diploma\r\nshall be judged guilty of a misdemeanor (_ib._, s. 5).\r\n\r\nEXCEPTIONS.—The act does not affect the standing of any one practising\r\nat the time of its passage by virtue of a license under the then\r\nexisting law, nor any one then legally engaged in the practice of\r\nmedicine and surgery, nor does it prevent midwives from practising\r\ntheir calling or any one else from giving such simple domestic remedies\r\nas they are in the habit of using (_ib._, s. 6).\r\n\r\nEXAMINATIONS.—The constituted State board of medical examiners is\r\nauthorized to examine persons having no diploma from a medical college,\r\nand if found qualified to practise medicine and surgery issue a\r\ncertificate entitling the holder to practise in this State (_ib._, s.\r\n7).\r\n\r\nSYSTEMS, DEFINITION.—No discrimination of schools of medicine is\r\nallowed.

The board issues\r\ncertificates to all who furnish satisfactory proof of having received\r\ndiplomas or licenses from legally chartered medical institutions in\r\ngood standing (Act 1875-76, c. 518, s. 3).\r\n\r\nThe medical society of the State, the eclectic medical society of the\r\nState, and the State homœopathic medical society each appoint annually\r\na board of seven examiners who must be regular graduates (Act 1877-78,\r\nc. 576; amending Act 1875-76, c. 518).\r\n\r\nThe board examines diplomas as to genuineness. The affidavit\r\naccompanying the diploma must state that the applicant is its lawful\r\npossessor, and the person therein named; that the diploma was procured\r\nin the regular course of medical instruction and without fraud or\r\nmisrepresentation of any kind, and that the medical institution\r\ngranting it had, at the time of granting the same, a full corps of\r\nmedical instructors, and was at said time a legally incorporated\r\ninstitution, actually and in good faith engaged in the business of\r\nmedical education, and in good standing as a medical institution, and\r\nthat the applicant had complied with all the requirements of said\r\ninstitution. The affidavit may be taken before any person authorized\r\nto administer oaths, and must be attested under the hand and official\r\nseal of the officer, if he have a seal. The board may hear such further\r\ntestimony as they deem proper to hear as to the verification of the\r\ndiploma or the identity of the person, or the manner in which the\r\ndiploma was procured, and if it appears that any fact stated in the\r\naffidavit is untrue, the application is rejected. No board entertains\r\nan application rejected by another; a rejected application cannot be\r\nrenewed for at least one year (_ib._, s. 4, as amended by Act 1877-78,\r\nc. 918); no certificates are granted except to persons presenting\r\ndiplomas or licenses from legally chartered medical institutions in\r\ngood standing (_ib._, s. 5).\r\n\r\nCertificates must be recorded in the county of residence and the record\r\nindorsed thereon. A person removing to another county to practise must\r\nprocure an indorsement to that effect on his certificate from the\r\ncounty clerk, and must record the certificate in the county to which he\r\nremoves (_ib._, s. 6).\r\n\r\nThe board refuses certificates to individuals guilty of unprofessional\r\nconduct. The applicant is given an opportunity to be heard, by\r\ncitation; the attendance of witnesses may be compelled by subpœna;\r\nwitnesses may be examined at the hearing by either side, and either\r\nside may examine medical experts as to whether such conduct is\r\nunprofessional; if it appears to the satisfaction of the board that\r\nthe applicant is guilty of the unprofessional conduct set out in the\r\ncitation, no certificate can be granted. No application is refused for\r\nunprofessional conduct more than one year before the application. If\r\nthe holder of a certificate is guilty of unprofessional conduct, the\r\ncertificate must be revoked by board granting it; no revocation is\r\nvalid without similar proceedings to the foregoing (_ib._, s. 10).\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.—Any person is regarded as practising medicine who\r\nprofesses publicly to be a physician, or habitually prescribes for the\r\nsick, or appends to his name “M.D.”\r\n\r\nEXCEPTIONS.—The act does not prohibit gratuitous services in cases of\r\nemergency; nor apply to lawfully commissioned surgeons of the United\r\nStates army or navy practising their profession (_ib._, s. 11, as\r\namended 1877-78, c. 576).\r\n\r\nITINERANT VENDERS.—A license of $100 a month is exacted from itinerant\r\nvenders of drugs, nostrums, ointments, or appliances for treatment\r\nof disease, and from persons publicly professing to cure or treat\r\ndisease, injury, or deformity by any medicine, drug, or drugs, nostrum,\r\nmanipulation, or other expedient (Act 1877-78, c. 576, amending Act\r\n1875-76, c. 518, s. 12).\r\n\r\nPENALTY.—The penalty for violation of the act is a fine of from $50 to\r\n$500, or imprisonment in the county jail from 30 to 365 days, or both,\r\nfor each and every offence.

Each applicant, upon receiving from the secretary of the\r\nboard an order for examination, receives also a confidential number,\r\nwhich he must place upon his examination papers so that, when the\r\npapers are passed upon, the examiners may not know by what applicant\r\nthey were prepared. Upon each day of examination all candidates are\r\ngiven the same set or sets of questions. The examination papers\r\nare marked on a scale of 100.

If a diploma is found genuine and in possession of the person to\r\nwhom it was issued, the board, on payment of the fee to its secretary,\r\nmust issue a certificate. If a diploma is found fraudulent or not\r\nlawfully in possession of the holder or owner, the person presenting\r\nit, or holding or claiming possession, is guilty of a misdemeanor,\r\npunishable with a fine of from $20 to $100 (_ib._, s. 3).\r\n\r\nThe certificate must be recorded in the office of the county recorder\r\nin the county wherein the holder resides, within sixty days after its\r\ndate. Should he remove from one county to another to practise medicine,\r\nsurgery, or obstetrics, his certificate must be recorded in the county\r\nto which he removes. The recorder must indorse upon the certificate the\r\ndate of record (_ib._, s. 4).\r\n\r\nAny one failing to pass is entitled to a second examination within\r\ntwelve months without a fee; any applicant for examination, by notice\r\nin writing to the secretary of the board, is entitled to examination\r\nwithin three months from the time of notice, and the failure to\r\ngive such opportunity entitles such applicant to practise without a\r\ncertificate until the next regular meeting of the board. The board\r\nmay issue certificates to persons who, upon application, present a\r\ncertificate of having passed a satisfactory examination before any\r\nother State board of medical examiners, upon the payment of the fee\r\nprovided in sec. 3 (_ib._, s. 6, as amended c. 66, Laws 1888, 22 Gen.\r\nAssembly).\r\n\r\nThe board may refuse a certificate to a person who has been convicted\r\nof felony committed in the practice of his profession, or in connection\r\ntherewith; or may revoke for like cause, or for palpable evidence of\r\nincompetency, and such refusal or revocation prohibits such person\r\nfrom practising medicine, surgery, or obstetrics, and can only be made\r\nwith the affirmative vote of at least five physicians of the State\r\nboard, in which must be included one or more members of the different\r\nschools of medicine represented in the said board; the standing of a\r\nlegally chartered medical college from which a diploma may be presented\r\nmust not be questioned except by a like vote (_ib._, s. 7).\r\n\r\nDEFINITION, EXCEPTIONS.—Any person is deemed practising medicine,\r\nsurgery, or obstetrics, or to be a physician, who publicly professes\r\nto be a physician, surgeon, or obstetrician, and assumes the duties,\r\nor who makes a practice of prescribing, or prescribing and furnishing\r\nmedicine for the sick, or who publicly professes to cure or heal by any\r\nmeans whatsoever; but the act does not prohibit students of medicine,\r\nsurgery, or obstetrics from prescribing under the supervision of\r\npreceptors or gratuitous services in case of emergency; nor does it\r\napply to women at the time of its passage engaged in the practice of\r\nmidwifery, nor does it prevent advertising, selling, or prescribing\r\nnatural mineral waters flowing from wells or springs, nor does it\r\napply to surgeons of the United States army, navy, or marine hospital\r\nservice, nor to physicians defined therein who have been in practice\r\nin this State for five consecutive years, three years of which must\r\nhave been in one locality, provided such physician shall furnish the\r\nState board with satisfactory evidence of such practice and shall\r\nprocure a proper certificate, nor to registered pharmacists filling\r\nprescriptions, nor does it interfere with the sale of patent or\r\nproprietary medicines in the regular course of trade (_ib._, s. 8).\r\n\r\nPENALTY.—A person practising medicine or surgery without complying\r\nwith the act, and not embraced in the exceptions, or after being\r\nprohibited as provided in sec. 7, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable\r\nwith a fine of from $50 to $100, or imprisonment in the county jail\r\nfrom ten to thirty days (_ib._, s. 9).\r\n\r\nFiling or attempting to file as one’s own the diploma of another, or\r\nthe certificate of another, or a diploma or certificate with the true\r\nname erased and the claimant’s name inserted, or a forged affidavit of\r\nidentification, is forgery (_ib._, s. 10).\r\n\r\nFEES.—To county recorder, 50 cents (_ib._, s. 4).\r\n\r\nTo State board, for certificate to holder of diploma, $2 (_ib._, s. 3).\r\n\r\nTo secretary of State board, in advance, by candidate for examination,\r\n$10 (_ib._, s. 6).\r\n\r\nBy practitioner for five years, $2 (_ib._, s. 8).\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS.\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—It is unlawful for a person who has not attended two\r\nfull courses of instruction and graduated in some respectable school of\r\nmedicine, either of the United States or of some foreign country, or\r\nwho cannot produce a certificate of qualification from some State or\r\ncounty medical society, and is not a person of good moral character, to\r\npractise medicine in any of its departments for reward or compensation,\r\nfor any sick person; provided in all cases when any person has been\r\ncontinuously engaged in practice of medicine for ten years or more, he\r\nshall be considered to have complied with the provisions of the act\r\n(Gen.

Students who had matriculated in a New York medical school\r\nbefore June 5th, 1890, are exempt from this preliminary education\r\nrequirement provided that the degree be conferred before August 1st,\r\n1895.\r\n\r\nThe regents may in their discretion accept as equivalent for any part\r\nof the third and fourth requirements evidence of five or more years’\r\nreputable practice of medicine, provided such substitution be specified\r\nin the license (_ib._, s. 145).\r\n\r\nEach board is required to submit to the regents as required lists of\r\nsuitable questions for a thorough examination in anatomy, physiology,\r\nand hygiene, chemistry, surgery, obstetrics, pathology and diagnosis\r\nand therapeutics, including practice and materia medica. From these\r\nlists the regents are required to prepare question papers for all these\r\nsubjects, which at any examination are required to be the same for all\r\ncandidates, except that in therapeutics, practice, and materia medica\r\nall questions submitted to any candidate shall be chosen from those\r\nprepared by the board selected by that candidate, and shall be in\r\nharmony with the tenets of that school as determined by its State board\r\nof medical examiners (_ib._, s. 146).\r\n\r\nExaminations for a license are required to be given in at least four\r\nconvenient places in this State at least four times annually in\r\naccordance with the regents’ rules, and exclusively in writing and in\r\nEnglish. Each examination is conducted by a regents’ examiner who shall\r\nnot be one of the medical examiners. At the close of each examination\r\nthe regents’ examiner in charge is required to deliver the question\r\nand answer papers to the board selected by each candidate, or its duly\r\nauthorized committee, and such board, without unnecessary delay, is\r\nrequired to examine and mark the answers and transmit to the regents an\r\nofficial report stating the standing of each candidate in each branch,\r\nhis general average, and whether the board recommends that a license\r\nbe granted. Such report must include the questions and answers and is\r\nfiled in the public records of the university. If the candidate fails\r\non a first examination, he may, after not less than six months’ further\r\nstudy, have a second examination without fee. If the failure is from\r\nillness or other cause satisfactory to the regents they may waive the\r\nrequirement of six months’ study (_ib._, s. 147).\r\n\r\nOn receiving from a State board an official report that the applicant\r\nhas successfully passed the examinations and is recommended for\r\nlicense, the regents are required to issue to him, if in their judgment\r\nhe is duly qualified therefor, a license to practise medicine. The\r\ncontents and execution of the license are regulated in detail by the\r\nact.\r\n\r\nApplicants examined and licensed by other State examining boards\r\nregistered by the regents as maintaining standards not lower than those\r\nprovided by this article, and applicants who matriculated in a New\r\nYork State medical school before June 5th, 1890, and who shall have\r\nreceived the degree of “M.D.” from a registered medical school before\r\nAugust 1st, 1895, may, without further examination, on the payment of\r\nten dollars to the regents, and on submitting such evidence as they may\r\nrequire, receive from them an indorsement of their license or diploma\r\nconferring all the rights and privileges of a regents’ license issued\r\nafter an examination.\r\n\r\nIf any person whose registration is not legal because of some error,\r\nmisunderstanding, or unintentional omission shall submit satisfactory\r\nproof that he had all the requirements provided by law at the time of\r\nhis imperfect registration, and was entitled to be legally registered,\r\nhe may, on the unanimous recommendation of a State board of medical\r\nexaminers, receive from the regents under seal a certificate of the\r\nfacts, which may be registered by any county clerk and shall make valid\r\nthe previous imperfect registration.\r\n\r\nBefore any license is issued, it must be numbered and recorded in a\r\nbook in the regents’ office, and its number noted in the license. This\r\nrecord in all legal proceedings has the same weight as evidence that is\r\ngiven to a record of conveyances of land (_ib._, s. 148).\r\n\r\nEvery license to practise medicine is required, before the licensee\r\nbegins to practise, to be registered in the county clerk’s office,\r\nwhere such practice is to be carried on, with his name, residence,\r\nplace and date of birth, and the source, number, and date of his\r\nlicense. Before registering, each licensee is required to file an\r\naffidavit of the above facts, and that he is the person named in\r\nthe license, and had, before receiving the same, complied with all\r\nthe requisites as to attendance, terms, and amount of study and\r\nexaminations required by law and the rules of the university as\r\npreliminary to the conferment thereof; that no money was paid for such\r\nlicense except the regular fees paid by all applicants therefor; that\r\nno fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake in any material regard was\r\nemployed by any one or occurred in order that such license should be\r\nconferred.\r\n\r\nEvery license, or if lost a copy, legally certified so as to be\r\nadmitted as evidence, or a duly attested transcript of the record of\r\nits conferment, shall before registration be exhibited to the county\r\nclerk, who, only in case it was issued or indorsed as a license under\r\nseal by the regents, shall indorse or stamp on it the date and his name\r\npreceded by the words, “Registered as authority to practise medicine\r\nin the clerk’s office,—— County.” The clerk is required thereupon\r\nto give to every physician so registered a transcript of the entries\r\nin the register with a certificate under seal that he has filed the\r\nprescribed affidavit (_ib._, s. 149).\r\n\r\nA practising physician having registered a lawful authority to\r\npractise medicine in one county and removing such practice, or a part\r\nthereof, to another county, or regularly engaged in practice or opening\r\nan office in another county, must show or send by registered mail to\r\nthe clerk of such other county his certificate of registration. If\r\nsuch certificate clearly shows that the original registration was of\r\nan authority issued under seal by the regents, or if the certificate\r\nitself is indorsed by the regents as entitled to registration, the\r\nclerk is required thereupon to register the applicant in the latter\r\ncounty, and to stamp or indorse on such certificate the date, and his\r\nname preceded by the words, “Registered also in—— County,” and return\r\nthe certificate to the applicant (_ib._, s. 150).\r\n\r\nEvery unrevoked certificate and indorsement of registration is\r\npresumptive evidence that the person named is legally registered.\r\nNo person can register any authority to practise medicine unless\r\nissued or indorsed as a license by the regents. No such registration\r\nis valid unless the authority registered constituted at the time of\r\nregistration a license under the laws of the State then in force. No\r\ndiploma or license conferred on a person not actually in attendance at\r\nthe lectures, institution, and examinations of the school conferring\r\nthe same, or not possessed, at the time of its conferment, of the\r\nrequirements then demanded of medical students in this State as\r\na condition of their being licensed, and no registration not in\r\naccordance with this article, shall be lawful authority to practise,\r\nnor shall the degree of doctor of medicine be conferred _causa honoris_\r\nor _ad eundum_, nor if previously conferred shall it be a qualification\r\nfor practice (_ib._, s. 151).\r\n\r\nEXCEPTIONS.—The law does not affect commissioned medical officers\r\nserving in the United States army, navy, or marine hospital service\r\nwhile so commissioned; or any one while actually serving on the\r\nresident medical staff of any legally incorporated hospital; or any\r\nlegally registered dentist exclusively engaged in the practice of\r\ndentistry; or any manufacturer of artificial eyes, limbs, or orthopædic\r\ninstruments or trusses in fitting such instruments on persons in\r\nneed thereof; or any lawfully qualified physician in other States\r\nor countries meeting legally registered physicians in this State in\r\nconsultation; or any physician residing on a border of a neighboring\r\nState and duly authorized under the laws thereof to practise medicine\r\ntherein whose practice extends into this State, and who does not open\r\nan office or appoint a place to meet patients or receive calls within\r\nthis State; or any physician duly registered in one county called to\r\nattend isolated cases in another county, but not residing or habitually\r\npractising therein (_ib._, s. 152).\r\n\r\nPENALTY.—A person practising without lawful registration or in\r\nviolation of this article forfeits to the county $50, for each\r\nviolation and for every day of unlawful practice. To practise under\r\na false or assumed name or falsely personate another practitioner\r\nof like or different name is a felony. The violation of the other\r\nprovisions of the act, or buying, selling, or fraudulently obtaining\r\na medical diploma, license, record, or registration, or aiding or\r\nabetting such buying, selling, or fraudulently obtaining, or practising\r\nmedicine under cover of a diploma or license illegally obtained, or\r\nsigned and issued unlawfully or under fraudulent representation or\r\nmisstatement of fact in a material regard, or after conviction of a\r\nfelony attempting to practise medicine, or appending “M.D.” to the\r\nname or assuming to advertise the title of doctor in such manner as to\r\nconvey the impression that one is a legal practitioner of medicine or\r\nany of its branches without having legally received the medical degree,\r\nis a misdemeanor punishable with a fine of not less than $250, or\r\nimprisonment for six months for the first offence, and for subsequent\r\noffences with a fine of not less than $500 or imprisonment for not less\r\nthan one year, or both fine and imprisonment (_ib._, s. 159).\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.—As used in the article, university means the University\r\nof the State of New York. Medical school means any medical school,\r\ncollege, or department of a university registered by the regents as\r\nmaintaining a proper medical standard and as legally incorporated.\r\nMedicine means medicine and surgery; physician means physician and\r\nsurgeon (_ib._, definitions).\r\n\r\nFEES.—To regents, for examination, $25 (_ib._, s. 145).\r\n\r\nTo regents, for license without examination under sec. 148, $10 (_ib._,\r\ns. 148).\r\n\r\nTo county clerk, for registering affidavit and certificate, $1 (_ib._,\r\ns. 149).\r\n\r\nTo county clerk, for registration in an additional county, 25 cents\r\n(_ib._, s. 150).\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—No person can lawfully practise medicine or surgery, or\r\nany of the branches thereof, nor in any case prescribe for the cure of\r\ndisease for a fee or reward unless he shall have been first licensed\r\n(Code 1883, s. 3,122, as amended Act of 1885, c. 117, s. 1).\r\n\r\nThe board of medical examiners of the State consists of regularly\r\ngraduated physicians appointed by the medical society of the State\r\n(_ib._, s. 3,123, 3,126).\r\n\r\nThe board must examine all applicants for a license to practise\r\nmedicine or surgery, or any of the branches thereof, on anatomy,\r\nphysiology, surgery, pathology, medical hygiene, chemistry, pharmacy,\r\nmateria medica, therapeutics, obstetrics, and the practice of medicine,\r\nand grant to a competent applicant a license or diploma authorizing him\r\nto practise medicine and surgery or any of the branches thereof (_ib._,\r\ns. 3,124).\r\n\r\nWhere he has not been refused a license by the board, two members of\r\nthe board may grant a temporary license to any applicant to continue in\r\nforce no longer than the next regular meeting of the board (_ib._, s.\r\n3,125, as amended Act of 1889, c. 181, s. 3).\r\n\r\nThe board of examiners must assemble when and where the medical society\r\nassembles, which society must assemble at least once a year; the board\r\nmust remain in session from day to day till all applicants during the\r\nfirst five days after its meeting have been examined and disposed of\r\n(_ib._, s. 3,127).\r\n\r\nPENALTY, EXCEPTIONS.—A person practising without obtaining a license\r\nfrom the board shall not be entitled to sue for or recover any medical\r\nbill for services; and a person who has begun the practice of medicine\r\nor surgery in the State for a fee or reward since February 23d, 1885,\r\nwithout first obtaining such a license, shall in addition be guilty\r\nof a misdemeanor and punishable with a fine of from $25 to $100, or\r\nimprisonment at the discretion of the court for each offence; but the\r\nact does not apply to women pursuing the avocation of midwife, nor to\r\nany reputable physician or surgeon residing in a neighboring State,\r\ncoming into this State for consultation with a registered physician\r\nresident therein, except a physician residing in a neighboring State\r\nregularly practising in this State, nor does it apply to physicians who\r\nhave a diploma from a regular medical college prior to January 1st,\r\n1880 (_ib._, s. 3,132, as amended Act of 1885, c. 117, s. 2; Act of\r\n1885, c. 261, s. 1; Act of 1889, c. 181, s. 1).\r\n\r\nThe board may rescind a license upon satisfactory proof that a licensee\r\nhas been guilty of grossly immoral conduct (_ib._, s. 3,133).\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—Every person practising medicine or surgery in the\r\nState was required before January 1st, 1892, to appear personally\r\nbefore the clerk of the superior court of the county where he resided\r\nor practised, for registration, and all persons beginning to practise\r\nare likewise to appear and register within thirty days after obtaining\r\na license (Act of 1889, c. 181, s. 3, as amended Act of 1891, c. 90).\r\n\r\nAny person applying for registration must produce and exhibit before\r\nthe clerk a license from the board of medical examiners, or make oath\r\nthat he was practising medicine or surgery in this State prior to March\r\n7th, 1885, and thereupon the clerk shall register the date, with the\r\nname and residence of the applicant, and shall issue a certificate of\r\nregistration. The certificate entitles the recipient to practise in\r\nany county in the State, but if he removes his residence to another\r\ncounty he must exhibit his certificate to the clerk of such county and\r\nbe registered. Persons having a temporary license are not entitled to\r\nregister but may practise so long as the license is in force (Act of\r\n1889, c. 181, s. 4, as amended Act of 1891, c. 420).\r\n\r\nPENALTY, EXCEPTIONS.—To practise without registration and a\r\ncertificate is a misdemeanor punishable with a fine of from $25 to\r\n$100 or imprisonment for each offence, but this act does not apply to\r\nwomen pursuing the avocation of midwife nor to reputable physicians\r\nor surgeons residing in a neighboring State coming into the State for\r\nconsultation with a registered physician of this State (Act of 1889, c.\r\n181, s. 5).\r\n\r\nLICENSE FEE.—A license of $10 for each county in which he carries\r\non business is exacted from every (itinerant?) medical practitioner,\r\none-half for the use of the county and one-half for the use of the\r\nState; but a State license may be obtained from the State treasurer for\r\n$30 good for twelve months, and he is then exempt from the portion of\r\nabove tax due the State (Act 1891, c. 323).\r\n\r\nFEES.—To the secretary of the board, before issuing a license or\r\ndiploma, $10.\r\n\r\nTo the secretary of the board, for temporary license, $5 (Code, 3,130).\r\n\r\nTo clerk of the court, for registration and certificate, 25 cents.\r\n\r\nTo clerk of the county, for registration on removal, no fee (Act 1889,\r\nc. 181, s. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH DAKOTA.\r\n\r\nBOARD OF EXAMINERS.—The governor appoints a State board of examiners\r\nof nine members, eight of whom are practising physicians in good\r\nstanding; no member of any college or university having a medical\r\ndepartment shall be appointed.

The law allowed persons in continuous practice for five years\r\nor more, two years to comply with its provisions. In case a person is\r\na graduate of a school of medicine in any State or foreign country in\r\nwhich any condition or restriction is imposed by law upon the practice\r\nof medicine by graduates of medical schools in Ohio, he is subject to\r\nthe same restrictions or conditions.

If a graduate of medicine he must present his diploma to the board\r\nof examiners for verification as to its genuineness. If found genuine\r\nand the person named therein be the person claiming and presenting\r\nthe same, the board issues its certificate, which is conclusive. If\r\nnot a graduate, he must submit to an examination as the board shall\r\nrequire, and if the examination be satisfactory the board issues its\r\ncertificate, and the lawful holder is entitled to all the rights and\r\nprivileges mentioned in the act (Act February 28th, 1889, s. 1).\r\n\r\nThe governor appoints three persons from among the most competent\r\nphysicians of the State, residents of the State for seven years and of\r\nat least five years’ practical experience in their profession, to be\r\nthe board of examiners (_ib._, s. 2).\r\n\r\nThe board must issue certificates to all who furnish satisfactory\r\nproof of having received a diploma or license from a legally chartered\r\nmedical institution in good standing of whatever school of medicine,\r\nand they are not permitted to make discrimination against holders of a\r\ngeneral license or diploma under any school or system of medicine in\r\ngood standing (_ib._, s. 3, as amended February 21st, 1891).\r\n\r\nThe verification of a diploma consists in an affidavit of the holder\r\nand applicant that he is the person therein named, taken before any\r\nperson authorized to administer oaths, attested under the hand and\r\nofficial seal of the official, if he have a seal; graduates may present\r\ntheir diplomas and affidavits by letter or proxy. The act allows\r\npersons taking advantage of section 13 ninety days after its passage in\r\nwhich to procure a certificate (_ib._, s. 4, as amended February 21st,\r\n1891).\r\n\r\nAll examinations of persons not graduates or licentiates must be made\r\ndirectly by the board, and certificates authorize the person named to\r\npractise medicine and surgery (_ib._, s. 5).\r\n\r\nThe holder of a certificate must have it recorded in the office of\r\nthe county clerk of the county in which he resides, and the record\r\nmust be indorsed thereon. On removal to another county to practise he\r\nmust procure an indorsement to that effect on the certificate from the\r\nclerk, and have the certificate recorded in the office of the clerk of\r\nthe county to which he removes (_ib._, s. 6).\r\n\r\nThe examinations may be wholly or partly in writing and must be of an\r\nelementary and practical character, but sufficiently strict to test the\r\nqualifications of the candidate as a practitioner (_ib._, s. 8).\r\n\r\nThe board may refuse a certificate to an individual guilty of\r\nunprofessional or dishonorable conduct, and may revoke for like causes,\r\nafter giving the accused an opportunity to be heard in his defence\r\nbefore the board (_ib._, s. 9).\r\n\r\nDEFINITION, EXCEPTIONS.—Any person is regarded as practising medicine\r\nwho professes publicly to be a physician and to prescribe for the\r\nsick, or appends to his name the letters “M.D.;” but the act does\r\nnot prohibit students from prescribing under the supervision of a\r\npreceptor, nor gratuitous services in cases of emergency, nor does it\r\napply to commissioned surgeons of the United States army, navy, and\r\nmarine hospital service (_ib._, s. 10).\r\n\r\nITINERANT VENDER.—Any itinerant vender of any drug, nostrum, medicine,\r\nointment, or appliance of any kind intended for the treatment of\r\ndisease or injury, who shall publicly profess to cure or treat\r\ndiseases, injuries, deformities, or ailments by any drug, nostrum,\r\nmedicine, or other appliance, shall pay a license to the Secretary of\r\nthe State of $100 per month.\r\n\r\nViolation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not\r\nmore than $500 or imprisonment in a county jail for not more than six\r\nmonths, or both.

Each board is to consist of seven members appointed by\r\nthe governor from the full lists of the members of the said medical\r\nsocieties, and is to be composed exclusively of members of the same\r\nmedical society. Each appointee must be a registered physician in good\r\nstanding, and shall have practised medicine or surgery under the laws\r\nof the State for not less than ten years prior to his appointment.\r\n\r\nThe governor is to fill vacancies and may remove a member for continual\r\nneglect of duties or on the recommendation of the medical society with\r\nwhich he may be in affiliation, for unprofessional or dishonorable\r\nconduct (_ib._, s. 6).\r\n\r\nEXAMINATIONS.—For the purpose of examining applicants each board is\r\nto hold two or more stated or special meetings in each year after due\r\npublic notice. A majority constitutes a quorum, but the examination may\r\nbe conducted by a committee of one or more members authorized by the\r\nboard (_ib._, s. 9).\r\n\r\nThe boards not less than one week prior to each examination must\r\nsubmit to the council questions for thorough examination in anatomy,\r\nphysiology, hygiene, chemistry, surgery, obstetrics, pathology,\r\ndiagnosis, therapeutics, practice of medicine, and materia medica; and\r\nthe council must select therefrom the questions for each examination,\r\nand such questions for each examination shall be the same for all\r\ncandidates, except that in the departments of therapeutics, practice of\r\nmedicine, and materia medica the questions shall be in harmony with the\r\nteachings of the school selected by the candidate (_ib._, s. 10).\r\n\r\nThe examinations are to be in writing under rules prescribed by the\r\ncouncil. After an examination the board must act on it without\r\nunnecessary delay and transmit to the council an official report of\r\nits action stating the examination average of each candidate in each\r\nbranch, the general average, and the result, and whether successful\r\nor unsuccessful. The report must embrace all the examination papers,\r\nquestions, and answers, which shall be kept for reference and\r\ninspection for not less than five years (_ib._, s. 11).\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—The council must forthwith issue to each applicant\r\nreturned as having successfully passed said examination, and adjudged\r\nby the council to be duly qualified, a license to practise medicine and\r\nsurgery. The council must require the same standard of qualifications\r\nfrom all candidates except in therapeutics, practice of medicine, and\r\nmateria medica, in which the standard shall be determined by the boards\r\nrespectively. Before the license is issued, it must be recorded in a\r\nbook in the office of the council, and the number of the book and page\r\ncontaining the record noted on the face of the license; the records\r\nshall have the same weight as evidence as that given to conveyance of\r\nland (_ib._, s. 12).\r\n\r\nOn and after July 1st, 1894, any person not theretofore authorized to\r\npractise medicine and surgery in the State may deliver to the secretary\r\nof the council a written application for a license with satisfactory\r\nproof that the applicant is more than twenty-one years of age, is of\r\ngood moral character, has obtained a competent common-school education,\r\nand has received a diploma conferring the degree of medicine from\r\nsome legally incorporated medical college of the United States, or\r\na diploma or license conferring the full right to practise all the\r\nbranches of medicine and surgery in some foreign country. Applicants\r\nwho have received their degree in medicine after July 1st, 1894, must\r\nhave pursued the study of medicine for at least three years, including\r\nthree regular courses of lectures in different years in some legally\r\nincorporated medical college or colleges prior to the granting of said\r\ndiploma or foreign license. Such proof shall be made, if required,\r\nupon affidavit, and if the council is satisfied with the same it shall\r\nissue to the applicant an order for examination before such one of the\r\nboards of examiners as the applicant may select. In case of failure at\r\nthe examination the candidate, after the expiration of six months and\r\nwithin two years, shall have the privilege of a second examination by\r\nthe same board without additional fee. Applicants examined and licensed\r\nby State boards of medical examiners or State boards of health of other\r\nStates, on filing in the office of the medical council a copy of said\r\nlicense certified by the affidavit of the president and secretary of\r\nsuch board, showing also that the standard of acquirements adopted by\r\nsaid board is substantially the same as is provided by secs. 11, 12,\r\nand 13 of this act, shall without further examination receive a license\r\nconferring on the holder all the rights and privileges provided by\r\nsecs. 14 and 15 (_ib._, s. 13).\r\n\r\nFrom and after March 1st, 1894, no person shall enter upon the practice\r\nof medicine or surgery unless he has complied with this act and shall\r\nhave exhibited to the prothonotary of the court of common pleas of\r\nthe county in which he desires to practise a license duly granted,\r\nwhich shall entitle him to be duly registered in the office of such\r\nprothonotary.\r\n\r\nPENALTY.—Violating the provisions of this act shall be a misdemeanor\r\npunishable with a fine of not more than $500 for each offence (_ib._,\r\ns. 14).\r\n\r\nEXCEPTIONS.—The act does not interfere with or punish commissioned\r\nmedical officers serving in the army or navy of the United States,\r\nor its marine hospital service, while so commissioned, or medical\r\nexaminers of relief departments of railroad companies, while so\r\nemployed, or any one while actually serving as a member of the resident\r\nmedical staff of any legally incorporated hospital, or any legally\r\nqualified and registered dentist exclusively engaged in the practice\r\nof dentistry, nor interfere with or prevent the dispensing and sale\r\nof medicine or medical appliances by apothecaries [or] pharmacists,\r\nnor interfere with the manufacture of artificial eyes, limbs, or\r\northopædical instruments or trusses of any kind _for_ (_sic_) fitting\r\nsuch instruments on persons in need thereof, or any lawfully qualified\r\nphysicians and surgeons residing in other States or countries meeting\r\nregistered physicians of this State in consultation, or any physician\r\nor surgeon residing on the border of a neighboring State and duly\r\nauthorized under the laws thereof to practise medicine and surgery\r\ntherein, whose practice extends into the limits of this State, provided\r\nsuch practitioner shall not open an office or appoint a place to\r\nmeet patients or receive calls within the limits of Pennsylvania, or\r\nphysicians duly registered in one county of this State called to\r\nattend cases in another, but not residing or opening an office therein.\r\n\r\nThe act does not prohibit the practice of medicine and surgery by any\r\npractitioner who shall have been duly registered before March 1st,\r\n1894, according to the Act of June 8th, 1881, and one such registration\r\nshall be sufficient warrant to practise medicine and surgery in any\r\ncounty (_ib._, s. 15).\r\n\r\nFORMER LAWS.—All acts or parts of acts inconsistent with this are\r\nrepealed (_ib._, s. 17).\r\n\r\nFEES.—To the secretary of the council, upon application for a license,\r\n$25.\r\n\r\nTo the secretary of the county, upon application for a license by\r\nlicensees in other States, $15 (_ib._, s. 13).\r\n\r\nTo the prothonotary, upon exhibition of a license, for registry, $1\r\n(_ib._, s. 14).\r\n\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION.—Every physician must cause his name and residence to\r\nbe recorded in the town clerk’s office of the town where he resides\r\n(Public Statutes, 1882, c. 85, s. 12).\r\n\r\nPENALTY.—Wilful neglect or refusal to perform this duty is punishable\r\nwith a fine not exceeding $20 (_ib._, s. 11).\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—All physicians engaging in the practice of medicine\r\nor surgery, before doing so, must submit their diplomas to a board\r\nconsisting of three reputable physicians in each county.

A person not a graduate of medicine and who has not practised\r\nmedicine in this State under a certificate must be examined by the\r\nState board of health, or the two members thereof in the congressional\r\ndistrict where he resides, or if he resides out of the State by the\r\ntwo members in the congressional district nearest to his place of\r\nresidence, who, together with a member of the local board of health who\r\nis a physician, if there be such a member of the local board of health\r\nof the county in which the examination is held, shall examine him and\r\nif upon a full examination they find him qualified to practise medicine\r\nin all its departments, they, or a majority of them, shall grant him\r\na certificate to that effect, and thereafter he shall have the right\r\nto practise medicine in the State to the same extent as if he had the\r\ndiploma and certificate above mentioned. The members of the State board\r\nof health in each congressional district must, by publication in some\r\nnewspaper printed in the county in which their meeting is to be held,\r\nor if no such paper is printed therein, in some newspaper of general\r\ncirculation in such district, give at least twenty-one days’ notice of\r\nthe time and place of their meeting for the examination of applicants\r\nfor permission to practise medicine, published at least once a week for\r\nthree consecutive weeks before the day of such meeting.\r\n\r\nThis section does not apply to a physician or surgeon called from\r\nanother State to treat a particular case or to perform a particular\r\nsurgical operation in the State, or who does not otherwise practise in\r\nthe State (Code of W. Va., 1891, c. 150, s. 9).\r\n\r\nEvery person holding a certificate must have it recorded in the office\r\nof the secretary of the State board of health, and the secretary is\r\nrequired to indorse on said certificate the fact of such recordation\r\nand deliver the same to the person named therein or his order.\r\n\r\nThe State board of health may refuse certificates to individuals guilty\r\nof malpractice or dishonorable conduct, and may revoke certificates for\r\nlike causes; such revocation being after due notice and trial by the\r\nsaid board, with right of appeal to the circuit court of the county in\r\nwhich such individual resides; but no such refusal or revocation shall\r\nbe made by reason of his belonging to or practising in any particular\r\nschool or system of medicine (_ib._, s. 10).\r\n\r\nThe examination fee is not retained if a certificate is refused, but\r\nthe applicant may again, at any time within a year after refusal, be\r\nexamined without an additional fee, and if a certificate be again\r\nrefused he may, as often as he sees fit, on payment of the fee, be\r\nexamined until he obtains a certificate (_ib._, s. 11).\r\n\r\nExaminations may be wholly or partly in writing, and shall be of an\r\nelementary and practical character, embracing the general subjects of\r\nanatomy, physiology, chemistry, materia medica, pathology, pathological\r\nanatomy, surgery, and obstetrics, but sufficiently strict to test the\r\nqualifications of the candidate as a practitioner of medicine, surgery,\r\nand obstetrics. The chapter does not apply to females practising\r\nmidwifery (_ib._, s. 12).\r\n\r\nDEFINITION, EXCEPTIONS.—Any person is regarded as practising medicine\r\nwho professes publicly to be a physician, and to prescribe for the\r\nsick, or who appends to his name “M.D.” This act also applies to\r\napothecaries and pharmacists who prescribe for the sick.

S., 1878, s. 1,436, as amended c. 131,\r\n1887).\r\n\r\nNo person practising physic or surgery, or both, prohibited by the\r\nabove section from testifying in a professional capacity as a physician\r\nor surgeon, shall assume the title of doctor, physician, or surgeon by\r\nmeans of any abbreviation or by the use of any other word or words,\r\nletters of the alphabet of the English or any other language, or any\r\ndevice of whatsoever kind, printed, written, or painted, or exhibited\r\nin any advertisement, circular, handbill, letter, or other instrument,\r\nnor on any card, sign, door, or place whatsoever.\r\n\r\nPENALTY, EXCEPTIONS.—A violation of this act is a misdemeanor\r\npunishable with a fine of from $25 to $100, or imprisonment in a county\r\njail from ten days to sixty days for each offence (s. 1, c. 256, 1881,\r\nas amended c. 40, 1882).\r\n\r\nOn complaint in writing under oath before any magistrate or justice of\r\nthe peace charging the commission of an offence against the provisions\r\nof this act in his county, it is the duty of the district attorney to\r\nprosecute the offender, and in all such prosecutions the burden of\r\nproof shall be upon the defendant to establish his right to use such\r\ntitle under the provisions of this act (_ib._, s. 2).\r\n\r\nAny person prohibited by sec. 1 from assuming the title of doctor,\r\nphysician, or surgeon who shall practise or pretend to practise\r\nphysic or surgery, or both, is not exempted from any, but is liable\r\nto all, of the legal penalties and liabilities of malpractice, and\r\nignorance shall be no excuse for a failure to perform or for neglect\r\nor unskilfully performing or attempting to perform any of the duties\r\nrequired by law of practising physicians or surgeons. The act does not\r\nprevent students from practising under the direction of a qualified\r\npreceptor, nor women from practising midwifery, nor veterinarians from\r\npractising in their special department (_ib._, s. 3).\r\n\r\n\r\nWYOMING.\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—No person can lawfully practise medicine, surgery, or\r\nobstetrics who has not received a medical education and diploma from\r\nsome regularly chartered medical school having a _bona fide_ existence\r\nwhen the diploma was granted (R.

To file or attempt to file as his own a diploma or certificate\r\nof another, or a forged affidavit of identification, is a felony\r\nsubject to a fine and imprisonment in the penitentiary (_ib._, s.\r\n1,928).\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the police, sheriff, or constable to arrest all\r\npersons practising medicine, surgery, or obstetrics without complying\r\nwith these provisions (_ib._, s. 1,929).\r\n\r\nEXCEPTIONS.—This chapter does not apply to persons in emergency\r\nprescribing or giving advice in medicine, surgery, or obstetrics in\r\na section of country where no physician, surgeon, or obstetrician\r\nresides, or where no physician, surgeon, or obstetrician resides\r\nwithin a convenient distance, nor to persons prescribing in their own\r\nfamilies, nor to persons claiming to practise medicine, surgery, or\r\nobstetrics in any section of the State where no physician or surgeon\r\nhaving a diploma or a certificate resides (_ib._, s. 1,930).\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE.—On the trial of persons charged with the violation of\r\nthis chapter it shall be sufficient for the prosecution to show that\r\ndefendant has practised medicine, surgery, or obstetrics within the\r\ncounty where the indictment is found at any time since the passage of\r\nthe act (1876), and the defendant shall not after proof be entitled to\r\nacquittal until he shows by the testimony of some competent witness\r\nupon oath that the defendant has received a medical education, and a\r\ngenuine diploma from some regularly chartered medical school; provided\r\nthat the defendant may show such facts by depositions taken in the same\r\nmanner as depositions in civil cases (_ib._, s. 1,931).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL ACTS.—The Act 21 and 22 Victoria, c. 90, and the amendments\r\nthereof and additions thereto, are generally spoken of as the Medical\r\nActs.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL COUNCILS.—There is a general council of medical education and\r\nregistration of the United Kingdom, with branch councils for England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland (21 and 22 Vict., 1858, c. 90, s. 3, 6).\r\n\r\nMembers of the general council are chosen as provided in 49 and 50\r\nVict., c. 48, s. 7; those representing the medical corporations must be\r\nqualified to register under this act (21 and 22 Vict., c. 90, s. 7).\r\n\r\nThe general council appoints a registrar for England, and the branch\r\ncouncils for Scotland and Ireland appoint respectively a registrar for\r\nScotland and Ireland (_ib._, s. 10, 11).\r\n\r\nREGISTRAR.—It is the duty of the registrars to keep their registers\r\ncorrect, and to erase the names of all registered persons who shall\r\nhave died, and from time to time to make the necessary alterations in\r\nthe addresses or qualifications of persons registered. It is lawful for\r\nthe registrar to write a letter to any registered person, addressed to\r\nhim according to his address on the register, to inquire whether he has\r\nceased to practise or has changed his residence, and if no answer be\r\nreturned within six months from the time of sending the letter, it is\r\nlawful to erase the name of such person from the register, but it may\r\nbe restored by direction of the general council (_ib._, s. 14).\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—Persons possessed of one or more of the qualifications\r\ndescribed in Schedule A, on the payment of a fee not exceeding £5, are\r\nentitled to register on the production to the registrar of the branch\r\ncouncil for England, Scotland, or Ireland the document conferring\r\nor evidencing the qualification in respect whereof he seeks to be\r\nregistered, or upon transmitting by post to such registrar information\r\nof his name and address, and evidence of his qualifications and of the\r\ntime or times at which they were obtained. The several colleges and\r\nbodies mentioned in Schedule A may transmit from time to time to the\r\nregistrar, under their respective seals, lists of the persons who by\r\ngrant of such colleges and bodies respectively, are for the time being\r\nentitled to register, stating the qualifications and residences of such\r\npersons, and it shall be lawful for the registrar on the payment of the\r\nsaid fee to enter in the register the persons mentioned in such lists\r\nwith their qualifications and places of residences as therein stated\r\nwithout other application (_ib._, s. 15).\r\n\r\nThe general council is required to make orders for regulating the\r\nregisters from time to time (_ib._, s. 16).\r\n\r\nPersons actually practising medicine in England before August 1st,\r\n1815, were entitled to register under the act (_ib._, s. 17).\r\n\r\nAny two or more of the colleges and bodies in the United Kingdom\r\nmentioned in Schedule A may, with the sanction and under the direction\r\nof the general council, unite or co-operate in conducting the\r\nexaminations required for qualifications to be registered (_ib._, s.\r\n19, 37 and 38 Vict., c. 34).\r\n\r\nThe privy council may suspend the right of registration in respect of\r\nqualifications granted by any college or body (_ib._, s. 21).\r\n\r\nAfter such revocation, no person shall be entitled to register in\r\nrespect to any qualification granted by such college before revocation\r\n(_ib._, s. 22).\r\n\r\nThe privy council may issue an injunction directing any body entitled\r\nto grant qualifications to desist from imposing upon any candidate\r\nfor examination an obligation to adopt or refrain from adopting\r\nthe practice of any particular theory of medicine or surgery as a\r\ntest or condition of admitting him to examination or granting him\r\na certificate; and in the event of their not complying, may order\r\nthat such body cease to have the power of conferring a right to be\r\nregistered so long as they shall continue such practice (_ib._, s. 23).\r\n\r\nWhere any person entitled to be registered applies to the registrar\r\nof any branch council for that purpose, such registrar is required\r\nforthwith to enter in a local register the name and place of residence,\r\nand the qualifications in respect of which the person is so entitled\r\nand the date of registration; and in case of the branch council for\r\nScotland or Ireland, to send to the registrar of the general council a\r\ncopy of the entry, and the registrar of the general council is required\r\nto cause the same to be entered in the general register; and such\r\nregistrar is required to cause all entries made in the local register\r\nfor England to be entered in the general register (_ib._, s. 25).\r\n\r\nNo qualification is entered on the register, on the first registration\r\nor by way of addition to a regular name, unless the registrar be\r\nsatisfied by proper evidence that the person claiming it is entitled to\r\nit. Any appeal from the decision of the registrar may be decided by the\r\ngeneral council or by the council for England, Scotland, or Ireland, as\r\nthe case may be. Any entry proved to the satisfaction of such general\r\ncouncil or branch council to have been fraudulently or incorrectly made\r\nmay be erased from the register by an order in writing of such general\r\ncouncil or branch council (_ib._, s. 26).\r\n\r\nMEDICAL REGISTER.—The registrar of the general council is required\r\nto cause to be printed, published, and sold under the direction of\r\nsuch council, every year, a correct register of the names with the\r\nrespective residences and medical titles, diplomas, and qualifications\r\nconferred by any corporation or university or by a doctorate of the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, with the dates thereof, of all persons\r\nappearing on the general register as existing on January 1st in every\r\nyear. Such register is called the _Medical Register_, and a copy of\r\nthe _Medical Register_ for the time being is evidence that the persons\r\ntherein specified are registered according to the act, and the absence\r\nof the name of any person from such copy is evidence, until the\r\ncontrary be made to appear, that such person is not so registered;\r\nprovided, that in the case of any person whose name does not appear\r\nin such copy, a certified copy under the hand of the registrar of the\r\ngeneral council or a branch council of the entry of the name of such\r\nperson on the general or local register shall be evidence that such\r\nperson is so registered (_ib._, s. 27).\r\n\r\nIf any college or body exercise any power it possess of striking off\r\nfrom its list the name of any one of its members, it shall signify\r\nhis name to the general council and the said council may, if they see\r\nfit, direct the registrar to erase from the register the qualification\r\nderived from such college or body in respect of which such member was\r\nregistered, and the registrar shall note the same therein, but the name\r\nof no person shall be erased from the register on the ground of his\r\nhaving adopted any theory of medicine or surgery (_ib._, s. 28).\r\n\r\nIf any registered medical practitioner shall be convicted in England or\r\nIreland of any felony or misdemeanor, or in Scotland of any crime or\r\noffence, or shall be after due inquiry judged by the general council to\r\nhave been guilty of infamous conduct in any professional respect, the\r\ngeneral council may, if they see fit, direct the registrar to erase the\r\nname of such medical practitioner from the register (_ib._, s. 29).\r\n\r\nEvery person registered who may have obtained any higher degree or\r\nother qualification is entitled to have it inserted in the register\r\nin substitution for or in addition to his qualification previously\r\nregistered, on the payment of such fee as the council may appoint\r\n(_ib._, s. 30).\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION.—No person is entitled to receive for any medical or\r\nsurgical advice, or attendance, or for the performance of any operation\r\nor for any medicine which he shall have both prescribed and supplied,\r\nunless he prove upon the trial that he is registered under this act\r\n(_ib._, s. 32, as amended 23 and 24 Vict., c. 7, s. 3).\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.—The words “legally qualified medical practitioner” or\r\n“duly qualified medical practitioner,” or any words implying a person\r\nrecognized by law as a medical practitioner or member of the medical\r\nprofession in any act of Parliament, mean a person registered under\r\nthis act (_ib._, s. 34, as amended 23 and 24 Vict., c. 7, s. 3).\r\n\r\nEXEMPTIONS.—If they so desire, registered persons are exempt from\r\nserving on juries, and in all corporation, parish, ward, hundred, and\r\ntown offices, and in the militia (_ib._, s. 35).\r\n\r\nDISQUALIFICATIONS.—No unregistered person is permitted to hold any\r\nappointment as a physician, surgeon, or other medical officer in the\r\nmilitary or naval service, or in emigrant or other vessels, or in any\r\nhospital, infirmary, dispensary, or lying-in hospital, not supported\r\nwholly by voluntary contributions, or in any lunatic asylum, jail,\r\npenitentiary, house of correction or of industry, parochial or union\r\nworkhouse or poor-house, parish union, or other public established\r\nbody or institution, or to any friendly or other society for affording\r\nmutual relief in sickness, infirmity, or old age, or as a medical\r\nofficer of health (_ib._, s. 36, as amended 23 and 24 Vict., c. 7, s.\r\n3).\r\n\r\nNo certificate required by any act from any physician or surgeon\r\nlicentiate in medicine and surgery, or other medical practitioner, is\r\nvalid unless the signer be registered under this act (_ib._, s. 37, as\r\namended 23 and 24 Vict., c. 7, s. 3).\r\n\r\nPENALTY.—Wilfully procuring or attempting to procure one’s self to be\r\nregistered by making or producing or causing to be made or produced\r\nany false or fraudulent representation or declaration, or aiding or\r\nabetting therein, is a misdemeanor in England and Ireland, and in\r\nScotland a crime or offence, punishable by fine or imprisonment. The\r\nimprisonment cannot exceed twelve months (_ib._, s. 39).\r\n\r\nWilfully and falsely pretending to be or taking or using the name\r\nor title of physician, doctor of medicine, licentiate in medicine\r\nand surgery, bachelor of medicine, surgeon, general practitioner, or\r\napothecary, or any name, title, addition, or description implying\r\nregistration under this act, or recognition by law as a physician or\r\nsurgeon or licentiate in medicine and surgery, or practitioner in\r\nmedicine, or apothecary, is punishable on summary conviction by a\r\npenalty not exceeding £20 (_ib._, s. 40, 41).\r\n\r\nDECEASED PHYSICIANS.—Every registrar of deaths in the United Kingdom,\r\non receiving notice of the death of any medical practitioner, is\r\nrequired to transmit to the registrar of the general council and the\r\nregistrar of the branch council a certificate of such death with the\r\ntime and place, and on the receipt of such certificate the medical\r\nregistrar is required to erase the name of the deceased from the\r\nregister (_ib._, s. 45).\r\n\r\nEXCEPTIONS.—The general council was by the act empowered by special\r\norder to dispense with such provisions of this act or such part of any\r\nregulations made by its authority as to them should seem fit, in favor\r\nof persons at the time of its passage practising medicine or surgery\r\nin any part of Her Majesty’s dominions other than Great Britain and\r\nIreland by virtue of any of the qualifications in Schedule A, and in\r\nfavor of persons practising medicine or surgery within the United\r\nKingdom on foreign or colonial diplomas or degrees before the passage\r\nof this act, and in favor of any persons who had held appointments as\r\nsurgeons or assistant surgeons in the army, navy, or militia, or in the\r\nservice of the East India Company, or who were acting as surgeons in\r\nthe public service, or in the service of any charitable institution,\r\nand in favor of medical students who commenced their professional\r\nstudies before its passage (_ib._, s. 46).\r\n\r\nThe _qualifications_ specified in _Schedule A_ are as follows:\r\n\r\n1.

provided always such person is engaged in no medical practice\r\nexcept as such resident physician or medical officer (22 Vict., c. 21,\r\ns. 6).\r\n\r\nThe following qualification was added by 23 and 24 Vict., c. 7, s. 1:\r\n\r\nA diploma or license in surgery granted by any university in Ireland\r\nlegally authorized to grant the same.\r\n\r\nThe act 39 and 40 Vict., c. 40, in sec. 3, provides that all persons\r\nwho have obtained from any university of the United Kingdom legally\r\nauthorized to confer the same, the degree of bachelor in surgery, shall\r\nbe permitted to register the same as a qualification under 21 and 22\r\nVict., c. 90.\r\n\r\nThe diploma of a member of the King’s and Queen’s College of Physicians\r\nin Ireland, and the degree of Master in Obstetrics of any university in\r\nthe United Kingdom are added to the qualifications in Schedule A of the\r\nMedical Act of 1858 (49 and 50 Vict., c. 48, s. 20).\r\n\r\nThe change of name of any of the corporations named in 21 and 22 Vict.,\r\nc. 90, is not to alter or affect the qualifications constituted by the\r\nact (23 and 24 Vict., c. 66, s. 3).\r\n\r\nREVOCATION OF LICENSE.—The Society of Apothecaries may strike\r\noff from the list of licentiates of said society the name of any\r\nperson who shall be convicted in England or Ireland of any felony or\r\nmisdemeanor, or in Scotland of any crime or offence, or who shall,\r\nafter due inquiry, be judged by the general council to have been\r\nguilty of infamous conduct in any professional respect, and the said\r\nsociety shall forthwith signify to the general council the name of the\r\nlicentiate so stricken off (37 and 38 Vict., c. 34, s. 4).\r\n\r\nWOMEN.—The Society of Apothecaries is not relieved from any existing\r\nobligation, nor deprived of any right, to admit women to the\r\nexaminations required for certificates to practise as apothecaries, or\r\nto enter the lists of licentiates of said society, any women who shall\r\nhave satisfactorily passed such examinations, and fulfilled the other\r\ngeneral conditions imposed upon persons seeking to obtain from the said\r\nsociety a qualification to be registered under 21 and 22 Vict., c. 90\r\n(_ib._, s. 5).\r\n\r\nThe act 39 and 40 Vict., c. 41, extends the powers of every body\r\nentitled under 21 and 22 Vict., c. 90, to grant qualifications for\r\nregistration so that it may grant any qualification for registration\r\ngranted by such body without distinction of sex—but nothing in this\r\nact is compulsory.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Act of 1886 (49 and 50 Vict., c. 48) modified the foregoing\r\nacts as follows:\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION.—A person cannot lawfully be registered under the medical\r\nacts in respect of any qualification referred to in any of those acts\r\nunless he has passed such qualifying examination in medicine, surgery,\r\nand midwifery as is in this act mentioned (49 and 50 Vict., c. 48, s.\r\n2).\r\n\r\nA qualifying examination shall be an examination in medicine, surgery,\r\nand midwifery held for the purpose of granting a diploma or diplomas\r\nconferring the right of registration under the medical acts, by any of\r\nthe following bodies:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Any university in the United Kingdom, or any medical corporation\r\nlegally qualified at the time of the passage of this act to grant such\r\ndiploma or diplomas in respect of medicine or surgery; or\r\n\r\n(_b_) Any combination of two or more medical corporations in the same\r\npart of the United Kingdom, who may agree to hold a joint examination\r\nin medicine, surgery, and midwifery, and of whom one at least is\r\ncapable of granting such diploma as aforesaid in respect of medicine,\r\nand one at least is capable of granting such diploma in respect of\r\nsurgery; or\r\n\r\n(_c_) Any combination of any such university as aforesaid with any\r\nother such university or universities, or of any such university or\r\nuniversities with a medical corporation or corporations; the bodies\r\nforming such combination being in the same part of the United Kingdom\r\n(_ib._, s. 3 [1]).\r\n\r\nThe standard of proficiency at said examinations shall be such as\r\nsuffices to guarantee the possession of knowledge and skill requisite\r\nfor the efficient practice of medicine, surgery, and midwifery. It\r\nis the duty of the general council to secure the maintenance of such\r\nstandard of proficiency, and it may appoint such number of inspectors\r\nas it may determine who shall attend at all or any of the said\r\nexaminations (_ib._, s. 3 [2]).\r\n\r\nThe inspectors are not to interfere with the conduct of any\r\nexamination, but to report to the general council their opinion as\r\nto the sufficiency or insufficiency of every examination which they\r\nattend, and such other matters in relation thereto as the general\r\ncouncil may require (_ib._, s. 3 [3]).\r\n\r\nIf it appears to the general council that the standard of proficiency\r\nin medicine, surgery, and midwifery, or in any of those subjects or\r\nany branch thereof required at such examinations by any such body, is\r\ninsufficient, the privy council, on a report from the general council\r\nafter considering such report, and any objection thereto by any body\r\nto which it relates, may by order declare that the examination of\r\nsuch body or bodies shall not be deemed a qualifying examination for\r\nregistration, and Her Majesty, with the advice of the privy council,\r\nmay revoke such order if upon further report from the general council,\r\nor any body to which it relates, it seems to her expedient (_ib._, s. 4\r\n[1]).\r\n\r\nDuring the continuance of such order, the examinations held by the\r\nbody or bodies to which it relates shall not be deemed qualifying\r\nexaminations, and a diploma granted to a person passing such\r\nexaminations shall not entitle such person to registration (_ib._, s. 4\r\n[2]).\r\n\r\nIf a medical corporation represent to the general council that it\r\nis unable to enter into a combination for holding a qualifying\r\nexamination, and the general council is satisfied that the said\r\ncorporation has used its best endeavor to do so on reasonable terms,\r\nthe general council may on the application of such corporation appoint\r\nany number of examiners to assist at the examinations for granting a\r\ndiploma conferring on the holder the right of registration (_ib._, s. 5\r\n[1]).\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the said assistant examiners to secure at the said\r\nexaminations the maintenance of such standard of proficiency in\r\nmedicine, surgery, and midwifery as is required from candidates at\r\nqualifying examinations, and any examination held subject to this\r\nsection shall be deemed a qualifying examination (_ib._, s. 5 [2]).\r\n\r\nPRACTITIONER’S RIGHTS.—A registered medical practitioner shall be\r\nentitled to practise medicine, surgery, and midwifery in the United\r\nKingdom, and subject to any local law, in any other part of Her\r\nMajesty’s dominions, and to recover in due course of law in respect\r\nof such practice, any expenses or charges in respect of medicaments\r\nor other appliances, or any fees to which he may be entitled, unless\r\nhe is a fellow of a college of physicians, the fellows of which are\r\nprohibited by by-law from recovering at law their expenses, charges or\r\nfees, in which case such prohibitory by-law, so long as it is in force,\r\nmay be pleaded in bar of any legal proceeding instituted by such fellow\r\nfor recovery of expenses, charges, or fees (_ib._, s. 6).\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF GENERAL COUNCIL.—The constituent members of the general\r\ncouncil are designated by this act in sec. 7.\r\n\r\nMembers of the general council representing the registered medical\r\nprofession must themselves be registered medical practitioners, and\r\nmembers of the branch council for the part of the United Kingdom in\r\nwhich they are elected (_ib._, s. 8).\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL AND FOREIGN PRACTITIONERS.—When a person shows to the\r\nsatisfaction of the registrar of the general council that he holds\r\nsome recognized colonial medical diploma or diplomas granted to him\r\nin a British possession to which this act applies, and that he is of\r\ngood character, and is by law entitled to practise medicine, surgery,\r\nand midwifery in such British possession, he shall on application to\r\nthe said registrar, and on the payment of such fee not exceeding £5,\r\nas the general council may determine, be entitled without examination\r\nin the United Kingdom to be registered as a colonial practitioner in\r\nthe medical register; provided he proves to the satisfaction of the\r\nregistrar:\r\n\r\n(1) That the said diploma or diplomas was or were granted to him at a\r\ntime when he was not domiciled in the United Kingdom, or in the course\r\nof a period of not less than five years during the whole of which he\r\nresided outside of the United Kingdom; or\r\n\r\n(2) That he was practising medicine or surgery or a branch of medicine\r\nor surgery in the United Kingdom on the prescribed day, and that he has\r\ncontinued practising the same either in the United Kingdom or elsewhere\r\nfor not less than ten years immediately preceding the prescribed day\r\n(_ib._, s. 11).\r\n\r\nWhen a person shows to the satisfaction of the registrar of the\r\ngeneral council that he holds some recognized foreign medical diploma\r\nor diplomas granted in a foreign country, to which this act applies,\r\nand that he is of good character, and is by law entitled to practise\r\nmedicine, surgery, and midwifery in such foreign country, he shall\r\non application to said registrar, and on payment of such fee, not\r\nexceeding £5, as the general council may determine, be entitled without\r\nexamination in the United Kingdom to be registered as a foreign\r\npractitioner in the medical register; provided he proves to the\r\nsatisfaction of the registrar:\r\n\r\n(1) That he is not a British subject; or\r\n\r\n(2) That, being a British subject, the said diploma or diplomas was or\r\nwere granted to him at a time when he was not domiciled in the United\r\nKingdom or in the course of a period of not less than five years,\r\nduring the whole of which he resided out of the United Kingdom; or\r\n\r\n(3) That, being a British subject, he was practising medicine or\r\nsurgery, or a branch of medicine or surgery in the United Kingdom on\r\nthe prescribed day, and that he has continued practising the same\r\nin the United Kingdom or elsewhere, for not less than ten years\r\nimmediately preceding the said prescribed day (_ib._, s. 12).\r\n\r\nThe medical diploma granted in a British possession or foreign country\r\nto which this act applies, which is to be deemed requisite, shall\r\nbe such a diploma as may be recognized by the general council as\r\nfurnishing a sufficient guarantee of the possession of the requisite\r\nknowledge and skill for the efficient practice of medicine, surgery,\r\nand midwifery.\r\n\r\nWhen the general council have refused to recognize any such diploma,\r\nthe privy council may, on appeal, after communicating with the general\r\ncouncil, order the general council to recognize such diploma.\r\n\r\nIf the refusal of the registration of a colonial or foreign\r\npractitioner be on any other ground, the registrar of the general\r\ncouncil shall, if required, state in writing the reason for the\r\nrefusal, and the person refused may appeal to the privy council, which,\r\nafter communicating with the general council, may dismiss the appeal\r\nor order the general council to enter the name of the applicant on the\r\nregister.\r\n\r\nA person may be registered both as a colonial and foreign practitioner\r\n(_ib._, s. 13).\r\n\r\nThe medical register shall contain separate lists of the names and\r\naddresses of colonial and foreign practitioners, and the provisions\r\nof 21 and 22 Vict., c. 90, relating to persons registered and to the\r\nmedical register, and to offences, shall apply in the case of colonial\r\nand foreign practitioners registered under this act so far as may be\r\n(_ib._, s. 14).\r\n\r\nAny registered practitioner on the list of colonial or foreign\r\npractitioners who is in possession of or obtains any recognized\r\ncolonial or foreign medical diploma granted in a British possession or\r\nforeign country to which this act applies may cause a description of\r\nsuch diploma to be added to his name in the medical register (_ib._, s.\r\n15).\r\n\r\nAny registered medical practitioner on the medical register by virtue\r\nof English, Scotch, or Irish qualifications, and in possession of a\r\nforeign degree in medicine, may cause a description of such foreign\r\ndegree to be added to his name as an additional title in the medical\r\nregister, provided he satisfy the general council that he obtained such\r\ndegree after a proper examination and prior to the passage of this act\r\n(_ib._, s. 16).\r\n\r\nHer Majesty may from time to time, by order in the council, declare\r\nthat this act be deemed to apply to any British possession or foreign\r\ncountry which in the opinion of Her Majesty affords the registered\r\nmedical practitioners of the United Kingdom such privileges of practice\r\nin the said British possessions or foreign countries as to Her Majesty\r\nmay seem just; and on and after the day named in such order such\r\nBritish possession or foreign country shall be deemed to be a British\r\npossession or foreign country to which this act applies. Her Majesty\r\nmay also renew or revoke any such order, and upon such revocation such\r\npossession or foreign country shall cease to be a possession or country\r\nto which this act applies without prejudice to the right of any person\r\nwhose name has already been entered on the register (_ib._, s. 17).\r\n\r\nNothing in the Medical Act of 1858 shall prevent a person holding\r\na medical diploma, entitling him to practise medicine or surgery\r\nin a British possession to which this act applies, from holding an\r\nappointment as a medical officer in any vessel registered in that\r\npossession (_ib._, s. 18).\r\n\r\nDEFAULT OF GENERAL COUNCIL.—In default of the general council to\r\nperform any duty, the privy council may notify their opinion to\r\nthe general council, and on the failure of the general council to\r\ncomply with any direction of the privy council, the privy council may\r\nthemselves give effect to such direction, and for that purpose exercise\r\nany power vested in the general council, and of their own motion do\r\nanything which they are authorized to do in pursuance of a report or\r\nsuggestion from the general council (_ib._, s. 19).\r\n\r\nSANITARY SCIENCE.—Every registered medical practitioner to whom a\r\ndiploma for proficiency in sanitary science, public health or state\r\nmedicine has after special examination been granted, by any college or\r\nfaculty of physicians or surgeons or university in the United Kingdom,\r\nor by any such bodies acting in combination, shall, if such diploma\r\nappear to the privy council or general council to deserve recognition\r\nin the medical register, be entitled on the payment of such fee as the\r\ngeneral council may appoint, to have such diploma entered in the said\r\nregister in addition to any other diploma or diplomas in respect of\r\nwhich he is registered (_ib._, s. 21).\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE.—Any act of the privy council shall be sufficiently signified\r\nby an instrument signed by the clerk of the council, and every order\r\nand act signified by an instrument purporting to be signed by the clerk\r\nof the council shall be deemed to have been duly made and done by the\r\nprivy council, and every instrument so signed shall be received in\r\nevidence without proof of the authority or signature of the clerk of\r\nthe council or other proof (_ib._, s. 22).\r\n\r\nThe following copies of any orders made in pursuance of medical acts or\r\nthis act shall be evidence:\r\n\r\n(1) Any copy purporting to be printed by the Queen’s printer, or by any\r\nother printer in pursuance of an authority given by the general council.\r\n\r\n(2) Any copy of an order certified to be a true copy by the registrar\r\nof the general council, or by any other person appointed by the general\r\ncouncil, either in addition to or in exclusion of the registrar, to\r\ncertify such orders (_ib._, s. 23).\r\n\r\nRIGHTS UNAFFECTED.—This act does not vary the rights of persons\r\npractising as registered medical practitioners on the day preceding the\r\nday when it goes into effect (_ib._, s. 24).\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the repeal of any enactment repealed by this act, no\r\nperson legally entitled to practise as a medical practitioner in any\r\ncolony or part of Her Majesty’s dominions other than the United Kingdom\r\nshall cease to be so entitled if he would have been entitled if no such\r\nrepeal had taken place (_ib._, s. 25).\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.—In the act the word diploma means any diploma, degree,\r\nfellowship, membership, license, authority to practise, letters,\r\ntestimonial, certificate or other status or document granted by any\r\nuniversity, corporation, college, or other body or by any departments\r\nof or person acting under the authority of the government of any\r\ncountry or place within or without Her Majesty’s dominion (_ib._, s.\r\n27).\r\n\r\nFEES.—The fees are to be determined by the general council within the\r\nlimits set by the various sections authorizing fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL COUNCIL.—There is a body styled “The Medical Council of\r\nBritish Columbia,” composed of seven members who are registered medical\r\npractitioners elected by the votes of registered medical practitioners\r\n(Cons. Acts 1888, c. 81, s. 2, 3, 4, 5).\r\n\r\nNo person can lawfully vote at such election unless his fees to the\r\ncouncil have been paid; and no person is eligible to election unless\r\nqualified to vote at such election (_ib._, s. 14).\r\n\r\nA register of such qualified voters is required to be prepared by the\r\nregistrar of the council and no person is entitled to vote whose name\r\nis not on the register; it is the duty of the registrar to examine into\r\nthe written complaint of any medical practitioner as to the improper\r\nomission or insertion of any name in the list; and appeal from his\r\ndecision lies to a judge of the supreme court in a summary way, whose\r\ndecision shall be final, and no unregistered person may vote (_ib._, s.\r\n16, 17).\r\n\r\nREGISTER.—The council is required to appoint a registrar and to cause\r\na register to be kept by him of the names of all persons who have\r\ncomplied with this act and with the rules and regulations made by the\r\ncouncil respecting the qualifications of practitioners of medicine or\r\nsurgery, and those persons only whose names are inscribed in the said\r\nregister, are deemed qualified and licensed to practise medicine or\r\nsurgery except as hereinafter provided (_ib._, s. 26).\r\n\r\nThe registrar is required to keep his register correct, and to make the\r\nnecessary alterations in the addresses and qualifications of registered\r\npersons (_ib._, s. 27).\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—Every person at the passage of the act (1886)\r\nregistered under the medical ordinance of 1867 is entitled to be\r\nregistered under this act (_ib._, s. 28).\r\n\r\nThe council is required to admit upon the register any person who shall\r\nprocure from any college or school of medicine and surgery requiring\r\na three-years’ course of study, a diploma of qualification, provided\r\nhe furnish to the council satisfactory evidence of identity and pass\r\nbefore the members thereof a satisfactory examination touching his\r\nfitness and capability to practise as a physician and surgeon (_ib._,\r\ns. 29).\r\n\r\nThe council is required to admit upon the register every person\r\nmentioned in 49 and 50 Vict., c. 48, of the Acts of Parliament of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, duly registered under the imperial Medical Act, prior\r\nto and inclusive of June 30th, 1887, upon complying with the orders,\r\nregulations or by-laws of the council and giving due proof of such\r\nregistration, and that the person applying for registration has not\r\nlost the benefit of same by reason of misconduct or otherwise, and upon\r\npayment of the fees fixed by the council, not to exceed one hundred\r\ndollars (Act 1893, c. 27, s. 2).\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF COUNCIL.—The council is required to make orders,\r\nregulations, or by-laws for regulating the register and the fees to\r\nbe paid for registration, and to make rules and regulations for the\r\nguidance of examiners, and may prescribe the subjects and modes of\r\nexamination, and make all such rules and regulations in respect of\r\nexaminations not contrary to this act as they deem expedient and\r\nnecessary (Cons.

Every person mentioned in chap. 48 of Act 49 and 50 Vict. of the\r\nParliament of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n4. Every graduate in medicine upon examination of the University of\r\nManitoba.\r\n\r\n5.

Appeal lies from the registrar’s decision to the\r\ncouncil (_ib._, s. 35).\r\n\r\nThe registrar, if dissatisfied with the evidence adduced, may, subject\r\nto appeal to the council, refuse registration until proper evidence is\r\nfurnished, duly attested by oath or affirmation before a judge of any\r\ncounty court (_ib._, s. 36).\r\n\r\nFRAUDULENT REGISTRATION.—Any entry proved to the satisfaction of the\r\ncouncil to have been fraudulently or incorrectly made may be erased\r\nfrom the register by order in writing of the council (_ib._, s. 38).\r\n\r\nIf a person procures or causes to be procured his registration by false\r\nor fraudulent representations or declarations, the registrar may,\r\non the receipt of sufficient evidence of the falsity or fraudulent\r\ncharacter, represent the matter to the council, and may on the written\r\norder of the president, attested by the seal of the college, erase his\r\nname from the register, and cause notice of the fact and cause to be\r\npublished in the Manitoba _Gazette_, and after such notice has appeared\r\nsuch person shall cease to be a member of the College of Physicians\r\nand Surgeons, and to enjoy any privilege enjoyed or conferred by\r\nregistration at any further time without the express sanction of the\r\ncouncil (_ib._, s. 39).\r\n\r\nFORFEITURE OF RIGHTS.—Any registered medical practitioner convicted\r\nof felony or misdemeanor before or after the passage of the act or his\r\nregistration forfeits his right to registration, and by direction of\r\nthe council his name shall be erased. If a person known to have been\r\nconvicted of felony or misdemeanor presents himself for registration,\r\nthe registrar may refuse registration. If any person registered be\r\njudged, after due inquiry by the council, to have been guilty of\r\ninfamous or unprofessional conduct in any respect, the council may\r\ndirect the registrar to erase his name (_ib._, s. 40).\r\n\r\nThe council may, and upon the application of any three registered\r\nmedical practitioners shall, cause inquiry to be made into the case of\r\na person liable to have his name erased from the register, and on proof\r\nof such conviction or such infamous or unprofessional conduct shall\r\ncause his name to be erased; but no erasure shall be made on account of\r\nhis adopting or refraining from adopting the practice of any particular\r\ntheory of medicine or surgery, nor on account of conviction for a\r\npolitical offence out of Her Majesty’s dominions, nor on account of the\r\nconviction which ought not in the opinion of the council or committee\r\ndisqualify him from the practice of medicine or surgery (_ib._, s. 41).\r\n\r\nThe council may order to be paid, out of funds at their disposal,\r\nsuch costs as to them may seem just, to any person against whom any\r\ncomplaint has been made which, when fully determined, is found to have\r\nbeen frivolous and vexatious (_ib._, s. 42).\r\n\r\nAn entry erased by order of the council shall not be again entered\r\nexcept by order of the council or a judge or court of competent\r\njurisdiction (_ib._, s. 43).\r\n\r\nIf the council think fit, they may direct the registrar to restore any\r\nentry erased, without a fee, or on payment of a fee not exceeding the\r\nregistration fee, as the council may fix (_ib._, s. 44).\r\n\r\nThe council is authorized to ascertain the facts of any case for the\r\nexercise of its powers of erasing and restoring by committee (_ib._, s.\r\n45).\r\n\r\nThe act provides in detail for proceedings before such committee\r\n(_ib._, s. 46 to 50).\r\n\r\nNo action shall be brought against the council or committee for\r\nanything done _bona fide_ under the act. Appeal from the decision to\r\nerase lies to any judge of the court of Queen’s Bench for Manitoba,\r\nand such judge may make such order as to restoration or confirmation\r\nof erasure or for further inquiry, and as to costs, as to him may seem\r\nright (_ib._, s. 51).\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE.—In a trial under this act the burden of proof as to\r\nregistration is on the person charged (_ib._, s. 53).\r\n\r\nThe production of a certificate that the person named is duly\r\nregistered, certified under the hand of the registrar, is sufficient\r\nevidence of registration, and his signature in the capacity of\r\nregistrar is _prima facie_ evidence that he is registrar without proof\r\nof signature or that he is registrar (_ib._, s. 54).\r\n\r\nThe registrar is required to print and publish from time to time under\r\nthe direction of the council a correct register of the names and\r\nresidences, with medical titles, diplomas, and qualifications conferred\r\nby any college or body, with the date thereof, of all persons appearing\r\non the register as existing on the day of publication (_ib._, s. 55).\r\nThe register is called “The Manitoba Medical Register;” a copy thereof\r\nfor the time being purporting to be so printed and published is _prima\r\nfacie_ evidence that the persons specified are registered (_ib._, s.\r\n56).\r\n\r\nIn the case of any person whose name does not appear in such copy, a\r\ncertified copy under the hand of the registrar of the council of the\r\nentry of the name of such person on the register is evidence that\r\nsuch person is registered (_ib._, s. 57). The absence of the name of\r\nany person from such copy is _prima facie_ evidence that he is not\r\nregistered (_ib._, s. 58).\r\n\r\nPRACTITIONER’S RIGHTS.—Every person registered is entitled according\r\nto his qualifications to practise medicine, surgery, or midwifery, or\r\nany of them as the case may be, and to demand and recover full costs\r\nof suit, reasonable charges for professional aid, advice, and visits,\r\nand the cost of any medicine or other medical appliances rendered or\r\nsupplied by him to his patient (_ib._, s. 59).\r\n\r\nNEGLECT TO REGISTER.—A person neglecting to register is not entitled\r\nto the rights and privileges conferred, and is liable to all penalties\r\nagainst unqualified or unregistered practitioners (_ib._, s. 60).\r\n\r\nUNREGISTERED PERSONS.—It is not lawful for any person not registered\r\nto practise medicine, surgery, or midwifery for hire, gain, or hope of\r\nreward (_ib._, s. 61).\r\n\r\nNo person is entitled to receive any charge for medical or surgical\r\nadvice or attendance, or the performance of any operation, or for\r\nany medicine which he may have prescribed or supplied, unless he be\r\nregistered, but this provision does not extend to the sale of any drug\r\nor medicine by a licensed chemist or druggist (_ib._, s. 62).\r\n\r\nNo person can be appointed as a medical officer, physician, or\r\nsurgeon in the public service, or in any hospital or other charitable\r\ninstitution not supported wholly by voluntary contribution, unless he\r\nbe registered (_ib._, s. 63).\r\n\r\nNo certificate required from any physician or surgeon or medical\r\npractitioner is valid unless the signer be registered (_ib._, s. 64).\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.—The expression “legally qualified medical practitioner,”\r\nor any other words importing legal recognition as a medical\r\npractitioner or member of the medical profession, in any law, is\r\nconstrued to mean a person registered under this act (_ib._, s. 65).\r\n\r\nIMMUNITIES.—A person registered under this act is exempt from jury and\r\ninquest duty if he desire it (_ib._, s. 66).\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS.—No duly registered member of the College of Physicians\r\nand Surgeons is liable in an action for negligence or malpractice by\r\nreason of professional services requested or rendered, unless it be\r\ncommenced within one year from the termination of such service (_ib._,\r\ns. 67).\r\n\r\nEXAMINATIONS.—The University of Manitoba is the sole examining body\r\nin medicine, and the council of the university may grant to any person\r\na certificate under the seal of the university that the council of\r\nthe university have been satisfied that the person mentioned in the\r\ncertificate is, by way of medical education and otherwise, a proper\r\nperson to be registered under this act; but such certificate shall not\r\nbe granted until the person making such application shall have given\r\nevidence of qualification by undergoing an examination or otherwise,\r\nas the statutes of the university require, and the applicant shall in\r\nall other respects first comply with the rules and regulations of the\r\nuniversity in that behalf (_ib._, s. 68).\r\n\r\nHOMŒOPATHISTS.—Until a homœopathic medical college for teaching\r\npurposes is established in Manitoba, in the case of candidates wishing\r\nto be registered as homœopathists, the full time of attendance upon\r\nlectures and hospitals required by the university statutes may be spent\r\nin such homœopathic medical colleges in the United States or Europe as\r\nmay be recognized by the University of Manitoba (_ib._, s. 69).\r\n\r\nEvery candidate who at the time of his examination signifies his\r\nwish to be registered as a homœopathic practitioner shall not be\r\nrequired to pass an examination in materia medica or therapeutics, or\r\ntheory or practice of physic, or in surgery or midwifery, except the\r\noperative practical parts thereof, before any examiners other than\r\nthose homœopathic examiners who shall be appointed by the University of\r\nManitoba (_ib._, s. 70).\r\n\r\nUNLAWFUL PRACTICES.—To wilfully procure or attempt to procure\r\nregistration by false or fraudulent representation or declaration, is\r\npunishable by a penalty not exceeding $100.

The register\r\nis called the Medical Register; a copy for the time being purporting to\r\nbe so printed and published, or a certificate signed by the president\r\nof the council, and attested by the registrar with the corporate seal\r\nof the council, is _prima facie_ evidence that the persons therein\r\nspecified are registered and qualified; the absence of a name from such\r\ncopy or the want of such certificate is _prima facie_ evidence that\r\nsuch person is not registered. If a name does not appear on the copy, a\r\ncertified copy, under the hand of the registrar of the council, of the\r\nentry of a name on the register is evidence of registration (_ib._, s.\r\n8).\r\n\r\nENTRANCE UPON STUDY.—A person beginning or entering on the study\r\nof physic, surgery, or midwifery, for the purpose of qualifying to\r\npractise in the province, must have obtained from the council a\r\ncertificate that he has satisfactorily passed a matriculation or\r\npreliminary examination in the subjects enumerated in the act, unless\r\nhe has passed a matriculation examination for the medical course in\r\narts and science at some college in Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, the\r\nUnited States of America, or the Continent of Europe (_ib._, s. 10).\r\n\r\nThe act prescribes formalities for admission to such preliminary\r\nexamination (_ib._, s. 10).\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—Subject to the exceptions hereinafter, no person\r\ncan lawfully practise physic, surgery, or midwifery unless he be\r\nregistered, or unless he shall have received from the council a license\r\nto practise (_ib._, s. 11).\r\n\r\nNo person is entitled to registration or license unless he shall\r\nsatisfy the council that he has passed a matriculation or preliminary\r\nexamination; that after passing such examination he has followed his\r\nstudies for not less than four years, one of which may be under the\r\ndirection of one or more general practitioners duly licensed; that\r\nduring such four years he has attended at some university, college,\r\nor incorporated school of medicine in good standing, courses of\r\nlectures amounting together to not less than twelve months on general\r\nanatomy, on practical anatomy, on surgery, on practice of medicine,\r\non midwifery, on chemistry, on materia medica and pharmacy, and on\r\nthe institutes of medicine or physic, and one three-months’ course\r\nof medical jurisprudence; that he has attended the general practice\r\nof an hospital in which are not less than fifty beds under the charge\r\nof not less than two physicians or surgeons, for not less than one\r\nyear or two periods of not less than six months each; that he has\r\nalso attended two three-months’ courses or one six-months’ course of\r\nclinical medicine, the same of clinical surgery; that he has, after an\r\nexamination in the subjects of the course, obtained a degree or diploma\r\nfrom such university, college, or incorporated medical school if such\r\ninstitution require a four-years’ course for its diploma, or for the\r\nwant of such degree or diploma that he has satisfactorily passed an\r\nexamination in the various branches hereinbefore specified before the\r\nexaminers appointed by the council; that he is not less than twenty-one\r\nyears of age; that he has paid to the registrar of the council a fee\r\nof ten dollars.

In the\r\ncase of a person whose name does not appear in such copy, a certified\r\ncopy, under the hand of the registrar, of the entry of his name on\r\nthe register is evidence that such person is registered under the\r\nprovisions of this chapter (_ib._, s. 5).\r\n\r\nSTUDENTS.—No person can begin or enter on the study of physic,\r\nsurgery, or midwifery, for the purpose of qualifying himself to\r\npractise in the province, unless he shall have obtained from the\r\nprovincial medical board a certificate that he has satisfactorily\r\npassed a matriculation examination in the subjects specified in the\r\nchapter (_ib._, s. 6).\r\n\r\nThe chapter prescribes the prerequisites to admission to preliminary\r\nexaminations (_ib._, s. 7, 12).\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATION.—Subject to the exceptions hereinafter, no person\r\ncan lawfully practise physic, surgery, or midwifery unless his name\r\nbe registered and unless he shall have received from the provincial\r\nmedical board a license to practise (_ib._, s. 8).\r\n\r\nNo person is entitled to be registered or to receive a license\r\nto practise unless he satisfy the board that he has passed the\r\nmatriculation or preliminary examination; that after passing such\r\nexamination he has followed his studies during a period not less than\r\nfour years (one of which may be under the direction of one or more\r\ngeneral practitioners duly licensed); that during such four years he\r\nhas attended at some university, college, or incorporated school of\r\nmedicine in good standing, courses of lectures amounting together to\r\nnot less than twelve months on general anatomy, on practical anatomy,\r\non surgery, on the practice of medicine, on midwifery, on chemistry,\r\non materia medica and pharmacy, and on the institutes of medicine or\r\nphysiology, and one three-months’ course of medical jurisprudence;\r\nthat he has attended the general practice of a hospital in which\r\nare not less than fifty beds under the charge of not less than two\r\nphysicians or surgeons, for a period of not less than one year or two\r\nperiods of not less than six months each; that he has also attended\r\ntwo three-months’ courses or one six-months’ course of clinical\r\nmedicine, and the same of clinical surgery; that he has, after an\r\nexamination in the subjects of the course, obtained a degree or diploma\r\nfrom such university, college, or incorporated medical school, or,\r\nfor want of such degree or diploma, that he has satisfactorily passed\r\nan examination in the various branches hereinbefore specified before\r\nexaminers to be appointed by the provincial medical board; that he\r\nis not less than twenty-one years of age; and that he has paid the\r\nregistrar twenty dollars.\r\n\r\nThe provincial medical board has power, subject to the approval of\r\nthe governor in council, to make such alterations in the foregoing\r\ncurriculum as may from time to time be required (_ib._, s. 9).\r\n\r\nThe last preceding section does not apply to any person in actual\r\npractice duly registered under chap. 56 of Revised Statutes, 3d series;\r\nsuch persons are entitled to be registered and receive a license to\r\npractise under this chapter without fee. Notwithstanding such section,\r\nany person on producing to the said board conclusive evidence that\r\nhe has passed a matriculation or preliminary examination such as is\r\nrequired for persons beginning their medical studies in Nova Scotia;\r\nthat he has, before graduating or taking a diploma, studied for at\r\nleast four years in the manner provided in sec. 9 or pursued what\r\nthe board deem an equivalent course of study, and has passed a final\r\nexamination in the subjects of such course; or, for the want of any of\r\nsuch requirements, shall have fulfilled such conditions as the board\r\nmay determine and shall pay a fee of twenty dollars, shall be entitled\r\nto be registered and to receive a license to practise (_ib._, s. 10).\r\n\r\nPOWERS OF BOARD.—The said board among other powers has the power\r\nto examine all degrees, diplomas, licenses, and other credentials\r\npresented or given in evidence for the purpose of entitling the owner\r\nto practise in Nova Scotia; and to oblige the owner to attest on oath,\r\nor by affidavit, that he is the person whose name is mentioned therein,\r\nand that he became possessed thereof honestly; to cause every member\r\nof the profession practising in Nova Scotia to enregister his name,\r\nage, place of residence, place of nativity, date of license or diploma,\r\nand the place where he obtained it, in the register of the board; to\r\nappoint medical examiners to hold final examinations, such examiners\r\nto be regular qualified practitioners of not less than five years’\r\nprofessional standing, and three years’ residence in the province\r\n(_ib._, s. 12).\r\n\r\nREGISTER.—The registrar is required to keep his register correct, and\r\nto erase the names of all registered persons who shall have died, left\r\nthe province without any intention of returning, or ceased to practise\r\nfor five years, and to make from time to time the necessary alterations\r\nin the addresses or qualifications of persons registered. A name erased\r\nis required to be restored by the order of the board upon sufficient\r\ncause duly shown (_ib._, s. 15).\r\n\r\nNEGLECT TO REGISTER.—Persons entitled to register and neglecting\r\nor omitting to register are not entitled to any of the rights or\r\nprivileges conferred so long as the neglect or omission shall continue\r\n(_ib._, s. 16).\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF MEDICINE OR SURGERY.—No person shall be refused\r\nregistration or a license on account of the adoption or the refusal to\r\nadopt the practice of any particular theory of medicine or surgery. In\r\ncase of such refusal the party aggrieved has the right to appeal to the\r\ngovernor in council, who, on due cause shown, is required to issue an\r\norder to the board to register the name of such person and to grant him\r\na license (_ib._, s. 17).\r\n\r\nPOWERS OF REGISTRAR.—No qualification is entered unless the registrar\r\nis satisfied by proper evidence that the person claiming is entitled to\r\nit, and any appeal from the decision of the registrar may be decided\r\nby the board, and any entry proving to the satisfaction of the board\r\nto have been fraudulently or incorrectly made may be erased from the\r\nregister by order in writing of the board (_ib._, s. 18).\r\n\r\nFORFEITURE OF RIGHTS.—A medical practitioner convicted of felony or,\r\nafter due inquiry, judged by the board to have been guilty of infamous\r\nconduct in any professional respect, thereby forfeits his right to\r\nregistration, and if registered his name shall, by the direction of the\r\nboard, be erased from the register (_ib._, s. 19).\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL QUALIFICATIONS.—A registered person may have a higher\r\ndegree or an additional qualification obtained by him, inserted in\r\nthe register in substitution for or in addition to a qualification\r\npreviously registered, on the payment of such fee as the board may\r\nappoint (_ib._, s. 20).\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF REGISTERED PERSONS.—Every registered person is entitled\r\naccording to his qualifications to practise medicine, surgery, or\r\nmidwifery, or either or any of them as the case may be, and to demand\r\nand receive reasonable charges for professional aid, advice, and visits\r\nand the cost of any medicine or any medical or surgical appliances\r\nrendered or supplied by him to his patients (_ib._, s. 21).\r\n\r\nNo person is entitled to recover such charge unless he shall prove\r\non the trial that he is registered under this chapter. This does not\r\ninterfere with the sale by qualified druggists or chemists of articles\r\nproperly belonging to their business (_ib._, s. 22).\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.—The words “legally qualified medical practitioner” or\r\n“duly qualified medical practitioner,” or any other words importing a\r\nperson recognized by law as a medical practitioner or a member of the\r\nmedical profession, when used in any act of the legislature or legal or\r\npublic document mean a person registered under this chapter (_ib._, s.\r\n23).\r\n\r\nUNREGISTERED PERSONS.—No person shall be appointed as a medical\r\nofficer, physician, or surgeon, in any branch of the public service,\r\nor in any hospital or other charitable institution, unless he be\r\nregistered under the provisions of this chapter (_ib._, s. 24).\r\n\r\nNo certificate required from any physician or surgeon or medical\r\npractitioner is valid unless the signer be registered (_ib._, s. 25).\r\n\r\nOFFENCES AND PENALTIES.—For a person without registration or license\r\nto practise physic, surgery, or midwifery for hire, gain, or hope of\r\nreward, or wilfully or falsely pretend to be a physician, doctor of\r\nmedicine, surgeon, or general practitioner, or to take or use any name\r\nor description implying or calculated to lead people to infer that he\r\nis registered, or to profess by public advertisement, card, circular,\r\nsign, or otherwise to practise physic, surgery, or midwifery, or to\r\ngive advice therein or in anywise to lead people to infer that he is\r\nqualified to practise physic, surgery, or midwifery, is punishable with\r\na forfeiture of $20 for each day that he so practises or leads people\r\nto infer that he is practising (_ib._, s. 26).\r\n\r\nOn trial of such cause the burden of proof as to the license or right\r\nof the defendant to practise physic, surgery, or midwifery is on the\r\ndefendant (_ib._, s. 28).\r\n\r\nIf a person wilfully procures or attempts to procure registration by\r\nmaking or producing, or causing to be made or produced, a false or\r\nfraudulent representation or declaration, he, and all persons knowingly\r\naiding or assisting therein, are each punishable with a forfeiture of\r\nnot less than $100 (_ib._, s. 30).\r\n\r\nTo wilfully and falsely pretend to be or take or use any name or\r\ndescription implying registration, is punishable with a forfeiture not\r\nexceeding $100 (_ib._, s. 31).\r\n\r\nSuits under this chapter are not to be begun after one year from the\r\ndate of the offence or cause of action (_ib._, s. 32).\r\n\r\nEXCEPTIONS.—This chapter does not prevent a competent female from\r\npractising midwifery in Nova Scotia, except that she must satisfy the\r\nboard of her competency, and obtain a certificate from the registrar\r\nbefore she can lawfully practise in the city of Halifax (_ib._, s. 33).\r\n\r\nNothing in the chapter prevents any person from giving necessary\r\nmedical or surgical aid or attendance to any one in urgent need of it,\r\nprovided such aid or attendance is not given for hire or gain, nor the\r\ngiving of it made a business or way of gaining a livelihood (_ib._, s.\r\n34).\r\n\r\nEvery person residing in the province and who shall have practised\r\ntherein prior to January 1st, 1850, is entitled on proof thereof to\r\nhave his name registered and receive a license to practise under this\r\nchapter (_ib._, s. 36).\r\n\r\nA person while employed in active service in Her Majesty’s naval\r\nor military service as a physician or surgeon may practise physic,\r\nsurgery, or midwifery with (_sic_) registration or license (_ib._, s.\r\n37).\r\n\r\nSchedule B of the chapter prescribes the subjects for a matriculation\r\nor preliminary examination of those commencing the study of medicine.\r\n\r\nFEES.—To the registrar, for registration under secs. 9 and 10, $20.\r\n\r\nTo the registrar, for a preliminary examination under sec. 7, $10.\r\n\r\nFor registering additional qualifications, such fee as the board may\r\nappoint (_ib._, s. 20).\r\n\r\n\r\nONTARIO.\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS, ETC.—There is a corporation styled “The College\r\nof Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario” (Rev, St., 1887, c. 148, s. 2).\r\n\r\nAll persons registered according to the provincial acts 29 Victoria, c.\r\n34, and 37 Victoria, c. 45, and amendatory acts, are members of said\r\ncorporation (_ib._, s. 3);

Appeal from the decision of\r\nthe registrar may be decided by the council; any entry proved to the\r\nsatisfaction of the council to have been fraudulently or incorrectly\r\nmade may be erased from the register by order of the council in writing\r\n(_ib._, s. 33 [1]).\r\n\r\nIf the registrar be dissatisfied with the evidence adduced by a person\r\nclaiming to be registered, he has power, subject to appeal to the\r\ncouncil, to refuse registration until such evidence is furnished, duly\r\nattested by oath or affidavit before a judge of the county court of any\r\ncounty (_ib._, s. 33 [2]).\r\n\r\nERASURE AND RESTORATION OF NAME.—A practitioner is liable to have his\r\nname erased from the register where he has been convicted before or\r\nafter registration of an offence which, if committed in Canada, would\r\nbe a felony or misdemeanor, or where he has been guilty of any infamous\r\nor disgraceful conduct in a professional respect (_ib._, s. 34 [1]).\r\n\r\nThe council may, and on the application of any four registered medical\r\npractitioners must, cause inquiry to be made into the case of a person\r\nalleged to be liable to have his name erased under this section, and on\r\nproof of such conviction or conduct shall cause his name to be erased\r\nfrom the register. The name of a person shall not be erased on account\r\nof his adopting or refraining from the practice of any particular\r\ntheory of medicine or surgery; nor on account of a conviction for a\r\npolitical offence out of Her Majesty’s dominions, nor of conviction\r\nfor an offence which ought not either from its trivial nature or its\r\ncircumstances to disqualify a person from practising medicine or\r\nsurgery (_ib._, s. 34 [2]).\r\n\r\nThe council may order to be paid out of any funds at their disposal\r\nsuch costs as they may deem just to any person against whom any\r\ncomplaint has been made, which, when finally determined, is found to\r\nhave been frivolous and vexatious (_ib._, s. 34 [3]).\r\n\r\nWhen the council direct the erasure of any name or entry, it shall\r\nnot be again entered except by direction of the council or any of the\r\ndivisions of the high court of justice (_ib._, s. 35 [1], as amended\r\nAct 1891, c. 26, s. 3).\r\n\r\nIf the council think fit, they may direct the registrar to restore\r\nany name or entry erased, without fee, or on payment of such fee not\r\nexceeding the regular fee as the council may fix (_ib._, s. 35 [2]).\r\n\r\nThe council is required to ascertain facts, in the exercise of its\r\npowers of erasing and restoring, by a committee of their own body of\r\nnot more than five, and a written report of the committee may be acted\r\non by the council (_ib._, s. 36 [1], as amended Act 1891, c. 26, s. 4).\r\n\r\nAt least two weeks’ notice of the first meeting of the committee for\r\nascertaining the facts of any case must be served on a person whose\r\nconduct is subject to inquiry, and such notice must embody a copy of\r\nthe charges or a statement of the subject-matter of the inquiry, and\r\nspecify the time and place of meeting. The testimony is under oath, and\r\nsubject to cross-examination and the full right to call evidence in\r\ndefence and reply. In the event of the non-attendance of such person\r\nthe committee, on the proof of personal service of the notice, may\r\nproceed with the inquiry in his absence and without further notice\r\n(_ib._, s. 36 [5]).\r\n\r\nNo action can be brought against the council or committee for anything\r\ndone _bona fide_ under this act notwithstanding want of form in the\r\nproceedings. Any person whose name has been ordered erased may appeal\r\nfrom the decision of the council to any division of the high court\r\nat any time within six months from the date of the order of erasure,\r\nand the judge may make such order as to restoration, confirmation, or\r\nfurther inquiries by the committee or council and as to costs, as to\r\nhim shall seem right (_ib._, s. 37, as amended Act 1891, c. 26, s. 5).\r\n\r\nThe appeal may be by a summons served on the registrar to show cause,\r\nand is founded upon a copy of the proceedings before the committee, the\r\nevidence taken, the committee’s report, and the order of the council\r\ncertified by the registrar.

That he has reached the age of twenty-one years.\r\n\r\n3. That he has followed his studies during a period of not less than\r\nfour years, commencing from the date of his admission by the board to\r\nstudy medicine.\r\n\r\n4. That during said four years he attended at some university, college,\r\nor incorporated school of medicine within Her Majesty’s possessions not\r\nless than two six-months’ courses of general or descriptive anatomy,\r\nof practical anatomy, of surgery, of the practice of medicine, of\r\nmidwifery, of chemistry, of materia medica and general therapeutics, of\r\nthe institutions of medicine or physiology and general pathology, of\r\nclinical medicine, and of clinical surgery; one six-months’ course or\r\ntwo three-months’ courses of medical jurisprudence, one three-months’\r\ncourse of botany, one three-months’ course of hygiene, and a course\r\nof not less than twenty-five demonstrations upon microscopic anatomy,\r\nphysiology, and pathology.\r\n\r\n5. That he attended the general practice of a hospital in which are\r\ncontained not less than fifty beds under the charge of not less than\r\ntwo physicians or surgeons, for not less than one and one-half years or\r\nthree periods of not less than six months each.\r\n\r\n6. That he has attended six cases of labor and compounded medicines for\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\nEach six-months’ course shall have consisted of one hundred and twenty\r\nlectures except in the case of clinical medicine, clinical surgery, and\r\nmedical jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nOf four years’ study required by this section, three six-months’\r\nsessions, at least, must be passed in attending upon lectures at a\r\nuniversity, college, or incorporated school of medicine recognized by\r\nthe board.\r\n\r\nThe first of such courses must have been attended during the session\r\nimmediately succeeding the preliminary examination, and the last\r\nduring the fourth year of study, and the candidates must undergo an\r\nexamination on the final subjects of the curriculum at the end of the\r\nsession in the fourth year of study (_ib._, art. 3,985).\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF COLLEGE.—All persons obtaining a license to practise from\r\nthe College of Physicians and Surgeons of the province are members of\r\nthe college, but are not eligible for governors within four years from\r\nthe date of their admission as members (_ib._, art. 3,986).\r\n\r\nWOMEN.—The provincial medical board has power to make regulations\r\nrespecting the admission of women to the study and practice of\r\nmidwifery. Women who were legally qualified on the 31st of October,\r\n1879, to practise as midwives in the province, while required to\r\nconform to the rules of said college, retain their right. Nothing in\r\nthe act or the regulations shall prevent women in the country from\r\npractising midwifery or assisting at accouchements without being\r\nadmitted to the study or practice of midwifery; but they must obtain a\r\ncertificate from a duly licensed physician certifying that they have\r\nthe necessary knowledge (_ib._, art. 3,987).\r\n\r\nREGISTER.—The medical board is required to cause to be kept by the\r\nregistrar a register of persons duly licensed and registered, and\r\nwho have complied with the law and the regulations of the board, and\r\nthose persons only whose names are inscribed therein are deemed to be\r\nqualified and licensed (_ib._, art. 3,988).\r\n\r\nThe registrar is required from time to time to make the necessary\r\nalterations in the register (_ib._, art. 3,989).\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE.—The registrar, under the direction of the board of\r\ngovernors, causes to be printed, published, and distributed to the\r\nmembers, from time to time, a copy, called _The Quebec Medical\r\nRegister_, of the register, containing names, surnames, residences,\r\nmedical titles, diplomas, and qualifications conferred by a college\r\nor other medical body, with the dates of the same. A printed copy,\r\ncertified under the hand of the registrar as such, is _prima facie_\r\nevidence that the persons named and entered have been registered in\r\naccordance with this law. The absence of the name of any person from\r\nsuch copy is _prima facie_ proof that such person has not been lawfully\r\nregistered; provided always in case a person’s name does not appear\r\non such printed copy, a copy or extract from the register certified\r\nby the registrar of the college of the entry of such person’s name on\r\nthe register is proof that such person is duly registered (_ib._, art.\r\n3,990).\r\n\r\nA certificate under the hand of the registrar of the payment of the\r\nannual contribution of members of the college is _prima facie_ evidence\r\nthat such payments have been made (_ib._, art. 3,991).\r\n\r\nNEGLECT TO REGISTER.—A person entitled to register who neglects to\r\nregister is not entitled to practise medicine, surgery, or midwifery,\r\nor to claim any of the rights and privileges conferred, and is liable\r\nfor all penalties imposed for practising without registration, saving\r\nthe right of certain members holding a license from the College of\r\nPhysicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada (_ib._, art. 3,992).\r\n\r\nESTABLISHED PRACTITIONER.—A person who has attended medical lectures\r\nduring three sessions of a medical school in the British possessions,\r\nand who has actually been engaged in the practice of medicine for\r\nover thirty years in the province, may, on proof of these facts to\r\nthe satisfaction of the provincial medical board, and producing a\r\ncertificate signed by two resident medical practitioners in the\r\nneighborhood where he has practised that he has succeeded in his\r\nprofession, and is entitled to the consideration of the board, be\r\nentitled to a license and to registration without an examination\r\n(_ib._, art. 3,993).\r\n\r\nUNREGISTERED PERSONS.—No person unless otherwise authorized is\r\nentitled to recover any charge for medical or surgical advice, or\r\nprofessional service, or for the performance of any operation, or for\r\nany medicines prescribed or supplied, nor is he entitled to any of the\r\nrights or privileges conferred, unless he has registered according\r\nto law and paid his annual contribution to the college (_ib._, art.\r\n3,994).\r\n\r\nNo certificate required from any physician or surgeon or medical\r\npractitioner is valid unless the signer is registered (_ib._, art.\r\n3,995).\r\n\r\nPERSONS GUILTY OF FELONY.—Any registered member of the medical\r\nprofession convicted of felony forfeits his right to registration,\r\nand the medical board causes his name to be erased from the register\r\n(_ib._, art. 3,996).\r\n\r\nIf a person known to have been convicted of felony presents himself\r\nfor registration, the registrar is required to refuse him registration\r\n(_ib._, art. 3,997).\r\n\r\nOFFENCES AND PENALTIES.—A person not entitled to register convicted of\r\nhaving practised in contravention of this law, for reward or the hope\r\nof reward, is liable to a penalty of $50.\r\n\r\nA like penalty is incurred by every person assuming the title of\r\ndoctor, physician, or surgeon, or any other name implying that he is\r\nlegally authorized to practise, if unable to establish the fact by\r\nlegal proof, and by every person who in an advertisement in a newspaper\r\nor in a written or printed circular, or on business cards or on signs,\r\nassumes a designation so as to lead the public to believe that he is\r\nduly registered or qualified; and by every person who offers or gives\r\nhis services as a physician, surgeon, or accoucheur for gain or hope of\r\nreward, if he be not duly authorized and registered.\r\n\r\nBURDEN OF PROOF.—In every prosecution, proof of registration is\r\nincumbent on the party prosecuted.\r\n\r\nWITNESSES.—Members of the college are not incompetent witnesses by\r\nreason of their membership.\r\n\r\nCOSTS.—The court imposing a penalty adds costs, and, in default of\r\npayment within a delay which it fixes, condemns the defendant to\r\nimprisonment in a common jail of the district for sixty days (_ib._,\r\nart. 3,998).\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE.—In cases where proof of registration is required, the\r\nproduction of a printed or other copy or extract from the register,\r\ncertified under the hand of the registrar of the college, is sufficient\r\nevidence that all persons named therein are registered practitioners\r\nand any certificate upon such proof, or other copy of the register or\r\nextract from such register, purporting to be signed by any person in\r\nhis capacity of registrar of the college, is _prima facie_ evidence\r\nthat such person is registrar without proof of the signature or of his\r\nbeing in fact such registrar (_ib._, art. 3,999).\r\n\r\nHOMŒOPATHISTS.—The rights of homœopathists are not affected by the\r\nforegoing sections (_ib._, art. 4,002).\r\n\r\nThe homœopathic physicians and surgeons of the province form a\r\ncorporation under the name of the Montreal Homœopathic Association\r\n(_ib._, art. 4,003).\r\n\r\nThe corporation has power to appoint three medical graduates of a\r\nBritish or provincial university or medical licentiates of a British\r\nor provincial college or board legally incorporated to be a board of\r\nexaminers, to examine all persons who may desire to obtain a license to\r\npractise homœopathic medicine (_ib._, art. 4,008).\r\n\r\nA person desiring to be examined touching his qualifications to\r\npractise according to the doctrines and teaching of homœopathy shall\r\ngive notice in writing of at least one month to the secretary or\r\ntreasurer of the association, and show that he is not less than\r\ntwenty-one years of age; has followed medical studies for not\r\nless than four years under the care of one or more duly qualified\r\nmedical practitioners; has attended at some recognized university or\r\nincorporated school of medicine not less than two six-months’ courses\r\nof anatomy, physiology, surgery, theory and practice of medicine,\r\nmidwifery, chemistry, materia medica, and therapeutics respectively,\r\nand not less than one six-months’ course of clinical medicine and\r\nmedical jurisprudence respectively, or their equivalents in time;\r\nand shall have complied with the regulations of such university or\r\nincorporated school of medicine with regard to such courses, and\r\nshall have followed such other course or courses as may hereafter be\r\nconsidered by the board of examiners requisite for the advancement of a\r\nmedical education.\r\n\r\nAll such persons shall, at a regularly appointed time and place, be\r\nexamined on all the aforesaid branches by the board of examiners\r\n(_ib._, art. 4,009).\r\n\r\nIf the board be satisfied by examination that a person is duly\r\nqualified to practise either or all of said branches of medicine, as\r\ntaught and practised by homœopathists, they shall certify the same\r\nunder the hands and seals of two or all of such board.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant-governor, on receipt of such certificate, may, if\r\nsatisfied of the loyalty, integrity, and good morals of the applicant,\r\ngrant to him a license to practise medicine, surgery, and midwifery, or\r\neither of them, conformably to the certificate, and all such licensees\r\nare entitled to all the privileges enjoyed by licentiates of medicine\r\n(_ib._, art. 4,010).\r\n\r\nThe corporation appoints a secretary who keeps a register of names of\r\nall persons duly licensed to practise medicine, surgery, and midwifery,\r\nor either of them, according to the doctrines and teachings of\r\nhomœopathy.\r\n\r\nOnly those whose names are inscribed in said register are qualified\r\nand licensed to practise according to the doctrines and teachings of\r\nhomœopathy (_ib._, art. 4,015).\r\n\r\nThe said secretary is required to make the necessary alterations in\r\nthe addresses or qualifications of the persons registered (_ib._, art.\r\n4,016).\r\n\r\nOFFENCES AND PENALTIES.—A person practising according to the\r\nhomœopathic doctrines for reward in contravention of this act, or\r\nassuming a title implying that a person is legally authorized to\r\npractise according to homœopathic doctrines, if unable legally to\r\nestablish such authorization; or by advertisement published in a\r\nnewspaper or in a written or printed circular, or on business cards or\r\nsigns, assuming a designation to lead the public to believe that he is\r\nduly registered and qualified to practise according to the doctrines of\r\nhomœopathy; or offering or giving his services as physician, surgeon,\r\nor accoucheur for gain or hope of reward, if not duly authorized or\r\nregistered, is punishable with a penalty of $50.\r\n\r\nBURDEN OF PROOF.—In every prosecution, the proof of registration is\r\nincumbent on the party prosecuted.\r\n\r\nCOSTS.—The court may condemn the defendant to pay $50 in addition to\r\ncosts within a delay which it determines, and to imprisonment of sixty\r\ndays in a common jail of the district on default of payment within the\r\ndelay (_ib._, art. 4,017).\r\n\r\nWITNESSES.—A member of the corporation is not an incompetent witness\r\non account of his membership (_ib._, art. 4,018).\r\n\r\nFEES.—The provincial board of medical examiners may establish\r\nexamination fees (_ib._, art. 3,981).\r\n\r\nMembers of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of the Province of\r\nQuebec are required to pay an annual fee of $2 (_ib._, art. 3,986).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORENSIC MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nTHANATOLOGICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE\r\n\r\n  LEGAL STATUS OF THE DEAD BODY;\r\n\r\n  THE DISPOSAL AND OBLIGATION TO DISPOSE OF THE SAME;

BECKER, A.B., LL.B., ETC.,\r\n\r\n  _Counsellor at Law, etc.; Professor of Civil Law and Medical\r\n  Jurisprudence, Law Department, University of Buffalo._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGAL STATUS OF THE DEAD BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Disposal and Obligations to Dispose of the Same.=—There is no right\r\nof property, in the ordinary sense of the word, in a dead human body;\r\nbut for the health and protection of society it is a rule of the common\r\nlaw, and which has been confirmed by statutes in civilized states\r\nand countries, that public duties are imposed upon public officers,\r\nand private duties upon the husband or wife and the next of kin of\r\nthe deceased, to protect the body from violation and see that it is\r\nproperly interred, and to protect it after it is interred. A parent is\r\nbound to provide Christian burial for a deceased child, if he has the\r\nmeans, but if he has not the means, though the body remains unburied\r\nso long as to become a nuisance, he is not indictable for the nuisance\r\nalthough he could obtain money for the burial expenses by borrowing it\r\nof the poor-law authorities of the parish, for he is not bound to incur\r\na debt. (Reg. _v._ Vann, 2 Div. C. C., 325; 15 Jur., 1,090.) On the\r\nother hand it has been held in England, that every householder in whose\r\nhouse a dead body lies is bound by the common law, if he has the means\r\nto do so, to inter the body decently, and this principle applies where\r\na person dies in the house of a parish or a union. (Reg. _v._ Stewart,\r\n12 A. & D., 1,272.) And the expense may be paid out of the effects of\r\nthe deceased. (Tugwell _v._ Hayman, 3 Camp., 298, and note.)\r\n\r\nIn Pierce _v._ The Proprietors Swan Point Cemetery, 10 R. I., 227,\r\ns. c., 14 Am. Rep., 667, the Court said: “That there is no right\r\nof property in a dead body, using this word in its ordinary sense,\r\nmay be well admitted, yet the burial of the dead is a subject which\r\ninterests the feelings of mankind to a much greater degree than many\r\nmatters of actual property. There is a duty imposed by the universal\r\nfeelings of mankind to be discharged by some one toward the dead; a\r\nduty, and we may also say a right, to protect from violation; it may,\r\ntherefore, be considered as a sort of _quasi_ property, and it would\r\nbe discreditable to any system of law not to provide a remedy in such\r\na case; ... but the person having charge of it cannot be considered as\r\nthe owner of it in any sense whatever, he holds it only as a sacred\r\ntrust for the benefit of all who may from family or friendship have\r\nan interest in it.” See also Wyncoop _v._ Wyncoop, 42 Pa. St., 293; 4\r\nAlbany Law Jour., 56; Snyder _v._ Snyder, 60 How. Prac., 368; Weld _v._\r\nWalker, 130 Mass., 422; Guthrie _v._ Weaver, 1 Mo. Apps., 136; Johnson\r\n_v._ Marinus, 18 Abb. N. C., 72, and note.[493]\r\n\r\nThe law casts the duty of burial of the wife upon the husband, and\r\nof the husband upon the wife. In Secord _v._ Secord (cited in note 1\r\nabove), the Court said: “There are cogent reasons connected with public\r\npolicy and the peace of families, where in the absence of testamentary\r\ndisposition the possession of a corpse and the right to determine its\r\nburial should follow the administration of the estate.” Inasmuch as\r\nthe husband has the first right to administer upon the estate of the\r\nwife, and the wife upon the estate of the husband, the law imposes the\r\ncorrelative duty of burial upon the person having such right; and so\r\nit has been held that the husband is liable for the necessary expense\r\nof the decent interment of his wife from whom he has been separated,\r\nwhether the party incurring the expense is an undertaker or mere\r\nvolunteer.[494]\r\n\r\nWhere the deceased leaves a will appointing executors, the executors\r\nhave a right to the possession of the body, and the duty of burial\r\nis imposed upon them, but it has been doubted whether at common law\r\na direction by will concerning the disposal of the body could be\r\nenforced, and therefore the right to make such direction has been\r\nconferred by statute in several States.[495]\r\n\r\nAnd where a widow ordered a funeral of her husband, it was held that\r\nshe was liable for the expense, although she was an infant at the time,\r\nthe Court holding that the expense fell under the head of necessaries,\r\nfor which infants’ estates are liable.[496]\r\n\r\nIf there be no husband or wife of the deceased, the nearest of kin\r\nin the order of right to administration is charged with the duty of\r\nburial.[497]\r\n\r\nSuch acts as casting a dead human body into a river without the rites\r\nof sepulture (Kanavans Case, 1 Me., 226); stealing a corpse (2 East,\r\nPC., 652) or stealing for dissection a dead body of one executed when\r\nthe death sentence did not direct dissection (Rex _v._ Cundick, D. &\r\nR., n. p., 13), were indictable offences at common law.[498]\r\n\r\nIn the works of the early dramatists, and by some writers of fiction,\r\nit has been stated, or implied, that the body of a deceased person\r\ncould be seized and detained to compel the payment of his debts. This\r\nwas never the law. In Jones _v._ Ashburnham, 4 East, 460, it was held\r\nthat to seize a dead body on pretence of arresting for debt would be\r\n_contra bonos mores_, and an extortion on the relatives, and that case\r\ndistinctly overrules any authority to be derived from the case of Quick\r\n_v._ Coppleton, 1 Vent., 161, to the effect that forbearance to seize\r\nor hold a body upon such a pretence would afford any consideration for\r\na promise to pay a debt. So, also, where a jailer refused to give up\r\na body of a person who had died while a prisoner in execution in his\r\ncustody, to the executors of the deceased, unless they would satisfy\r\ncertain claims against the deceased due the jailer, the Court issued\r\na peremptory mandamus in the first instance, commanding that the body\r\nshould be delivered up to the executors (Rex _v._ Fox, 2 Q. B., 247).\r\nAnd in R. _v._ Scott, 2 Q. B., 248, it was said, that a jailer who\r\nshould attempt to do so would be guilty of misconduct in his public\r\ncharacter, for which he would be liable to prosecution.[499]\r\n\r\n_How and by Whom the Dead Human Body may be Removed or Exhumed._—Where\r\nthe right of burial has been exercised, and the body interred in\r\nits final resting-place, no person has any right to interfere\r\nwith it without the consent of the owner of the grave, or of the\r\nproperly constituted public authorities. In Foster _v._ Dodd, 8 D.\r\n& E., 842-854, it was held, that a dead body belongs to no one, and\r\nis, therefore, under the protection of the public. If it lies in\r\nconsecrated ground, ecclesiastical authorities will interpose for\r\nits protection; but whether in ground consecrated or unconsecrated,\r\nindignities offered to the remains or the act of indecently\r\ndisinterring them, are the ground of an indictment.[500]\r\n\r\nEven the purchaser of land upon which is located a burial-ground may\r\nbe enjoined from removing bodies therefrom, if he attempts to do so\r\nagainst the wishes of the relatives or next of kin of the deceased.\r\nEvery interment is a concession of the privilege which cannot afterward\r\nbe repudiated, and the purchaser’s title to the ground is fettered with\r\nthe right of burial.[501]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the right of the municipal or state authorities,\r\nwith the consent of the owner of the burial lot or in the execution of\r\nthe right of eminent domain, to remove dead bodies from cemeteries is\r\nwell settled.[502]\r\n\r\nAfter the right of burial has once been exercised by the person charged\r\nwith the duty of burial, or where such person has consented to the\r\nburial by another person, no right to the corpse remains except to\r\nprotect it from unlawful interference.[503]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where a husband did not freely consent to the burial\r\nof his wife in a lot owned by another person, it was held that a court\r\nof equity might permit him, after such burial, to remove her body,\r\ncoffin, and tombstones to his own lot, and restrain any person from\r\ninterfering with such removal.[504]\r\n\r\nIn Rhodes _v._ Brandt, 21 Hun, N. Y., 1, the defendant brought an\r\naction against one Beelard to recover for services rendered by him, as\r\na physician, in treating a child of Beelard’s for a fracture of the\r\nthigh-bone, in which action Beelard set up malpractice on the part of\r\nthe defendant as a defence. During the pendency of the action the child\r\ndied and was buried. Subsequently Beelard, the father, acting under the\r\nadvice of his counsel, directed and allowed the plaintiff, a physician,\r\nto cause the body of the child to be exhumed, and a portion of the\r\nthigh-bone to be removed, in order that it might be used in evidence on\r\nthe trial of the question of malpractice. After the bone was removed,\r\nthe body was returned to the grave. The defendant thereupon caused the\r\nplaintiff to be arrested for unlawfully removing the body from the\r\ngrave contrary to the provisions of the statute, and the plaintiff\r\nsued the defendant for malicious prosecution. The Court held that the\r\nplaintiff had not removed the body from the grave “for the purpose of\r\ndissection or from mere wantonness,” as these terms were used in the\r\nstatute (3 R. S., 6th ed., 965), for violation of which he had been\r\narrested, nor had he committed any offence against public decency or\r\nthe spirit of the statute.[505]\r\n\r\n_Autopsies, by Whom Ordered; the Rights of Relatives and Accused\r\nPersons._—As shown in a previous article in this volume, on the Powers\r\nand Duties of Coroners and Medical Examiners, in cases of sudden or\r\nsuspicious death, it has been the law for nearly a thousand years\r\nthat an inquisition or inquest _super visum corporis_ must be held by\r\nan officer known as a coroner, and that this office and its powers and\r\nduties were inherited by this country as part of the English common-law\r\nsystem in force at the time of the formation of the republic of the\r\nUnited States. When a body has been buried, and the coroner believes\r\nthat an inquest is necessary, he has power to disinter the body and\r\nhold an inquest, and he may direct a post-mortem examination to be\r\nmade, but after having done so he must cause the body to be reinterred.\r\nIt is now well settled that in holding such an inquest, and making such\r\nan autopsy or post-mortem examination required by his official duty,\r\nthe coroner has authority to employ, and it is his duty to employ,\r\nprofessional skill and aid, and his contract will bind the county to\r\npay a reasonable compensation for the same.[506]\r\n\r\nAs will be seen below from a synopsis of the statutes relating to\r\nthis matter, many of the States have enacted statutes defining and\r\nprescribing the duties of the coroner and other public officers in such\r\ncases. At an early period in England (see 2 and 3 Will. IV., chap. 75,\r\nsec. 7) it was enacted by the English Parliament that any executor\r\nor other person having lawful possession of the body of a deceased\r\nperson, and not being an undertaker or other party entrusted with the\r\nbody for the purpose only of interment, might lawfully permit the body\r\nof such deceased person to undergo an anatomical examination, unless\r\nto the knowledge of such executor or other party such person should\r\nhave expressed his desire during his life in writing, or verbally in\r\nthe presence of two or more witnesses during his illness whereof he\r\ndied, that his body after death might not undergo such examination, or\r\nunless the surviving husband or wife or known relative of the deceased\r\nshall require the body to be interred without such examination. By\r\nanother section of this statute (sec. 10), professors of anatomy and\r\nother persons duly licensed were declared not liable to punishment for\r\nhaving in their possession human bodies when having such possession\r\naccording to the provisions of the act.\r\n\r\nSection 308 of the New York Penal Code, subdivision 3, as amended\r\nby chapter 500, Laws 1889, enacts that whenever and so far as the\r\nhusband, wife, or next of kin of the deceased, being charged by law\r\nwith the duty of burial, may authorize dissection for the purpose\r\nof ascertaining the cause of death and no further, the right exists\r\nto dissect the dead human body. The same statute also provides that\r\nwhenever any district attorney of that State, in the discharge of\r\nhis official duties, shall deem it necessary, he may exhume, take\r\npossession of, and remove the body of a deceased person, or any\r\nportion thereof, and submit the same to a proper physical or chemical\r\nexamination or analysis, to ascertain the cause of death, which\r\nexamination or analysis will be made on the order of a justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of the State, or the county judge of the county in which\r\nthe dead bodies shall be, granted on the application of the district\r\nattorney, with or without notice to the relatives of the deceased\r\nperson, or to any person or corporation having the legal charge of\r\nsuch body, as the court may direct.

Bar_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE POWERS AND DUTIES\r\n\r\n  OF\r\n\r\n  CORONERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS.\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n\r\n  AUGUST BECKER,\r\n  _Of the Buffalo (N. Y.) Bar_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWERS AND DUTIES OF CORONERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE CORONER AND HIS COURT.\r\n\r\n_Coroner an Ancient Officer._—The office of coroner is one of the\r\nmost important and ancient known to the common law. A coroner, or\r\n_coronator_, was so called because he had principally to do with\r\nthe pleas of the crown, or suit wherein the king was immediately\r\nconcerned.[507] The office is first mentioned in a charter granted in\r\nthe year 925 by King Athelstan, to the authorities of Beverley. The\r\noffice as at present constituted was not clearly established until\r\nafter the Norman conquest.\r\n\r\nUnder this head come the lord chief justice and puisne justices of the\r\nKing’s Bench, who are supreme and sovereign coroners respectively.[508]\r\nThe duties of the office of coroner involve questions of the greatest\r\ninterest to society, to government, and to the rights and privileges\r\nof the individual citizen. The office has lost much of the honor and\r\nrespect which formerly appertained to it. Its character and importance\r\nhave been much diminished in latter times, making striking contrast\r\nwith the high estimation it was held in by our ancestors in days when\r\nnone but the gentry and knights of the shire were deemed eligible.\r\n\r\nIn fact so great was the dignity of this office in ancient times, that\r\nit was never presumed that coroners would condescend to be paid for\r\ntheir services.[509] They were chosen by all the freeholders of the\r\ncounty court for life or good behavior, and were liable to be removed\r\nfor cause by the writ _de coronatore exonerando_. There were three\r\nkinds of coroners at common law: _Virtute officii_; _virtute cartæ sive\r\ncommissionis_; and _virtute electionis_.[510] The office of coroner\r\nwas brought to America by the colonists along with the institutions of\r\nthe common law, and may be said to exist in the several States with all\r\nthe common-law incidents, except so far as they may have been modified\r\nby statute. The present defined powers of coroners in Great Britain and\r\nthe United States, unless modified by British statutes and American\r\nacts, are derived from the English Stat. de Officio Coronatoris, 4\r\nEdward I., s. 2. Coroners _virtute officii_ and _virtute cartæ sive\r\ncommissionis_ are unknown to our institutions. Here the office of\r\ncoroner may be classed under the head of coroners _virtute electionis_.\r\nGenerally speaking the coroner is a county officer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORONER’S DUTIES BOTH JUDICIAL AND MINISTERIAL.\r\n\r\nBy the common law his powers and duties are both judicial and\r\nministerial. In his ministerial capacity he is merely a substitute for\r\nthe sheriff, as when the sheriff is a party.[511] His powers and duties\r\nthereunder it is not the present purpose to state and define. His\r\njudicial authority relates to inquiries into cases of sudden death, by\r\na jury of inquest, _super visum corporis_, or, as it is more commonly\r\ndefined, an inquisition, with the assistance of a jury, over the body\r\nof any person who may have come to a sudden or violent death, or who\r\nmay have died in prison.[512] It is not necessary that the death should\r\nbe both violent and sudden, and that both these circumstances must\r\nconcur to give the coroner jurisdiction. It is sufficient to give the\r\ncoroner jurisdiction if the death occurs from any violence done to\r\na person by another, although such violence may not have terminated\r\nthe life of a party suddenly, and it is still the duty of the coroner\r\nto hold an inquest.[513] Indeed the presumption is that he has acted\r\nin good faith and on sufficient cause.[514] And so when several\r\npersons have been suddenly killed by the same violent cause, under\r\ncircumstances proper to be inquired of by a coroner’s inquest, it is\r\nproper and necessary for the coroner, acting in good faith, to hold a\r\nseparate inquest over each body.[515] A coroner’s inquest is a judicial\r\ninvestigation. The coroner cannot delegate his authority to any one.\r\nNeither can he appoint a deputy under the common law. He must act in\r\nperson as any other judicial officer; and it may safely be said that a\r\ncoroner has no power to appoint a deputy coroner, except where special\r\nprovision is made therefor by statute.[516] In England, a coroner’s\r\ncourt is a court of record, and it has accordingly been held that\r\ntrespass cannot be maintained for turning a person out of a room where\r\nthe coroner is about to take an inquisition.[517] But in this country,\r\nit may safely be said that a coroner’s court is not one of record,\r\nbut of inferior jurisdiction.[518] The performance of the functions\r\nof a coroner are judicial in their character; so judicial that he is\r\nprotected under the principles which protect judicial officers from\r\nresponsibility in a civil action brought by a private person. His\r\nproceedings amount to entries concerning matters of public interest,\r\nmade under the sanction of an official oath, and in compliance or\r\npresumed compliance of the law.[519]\r\n\r\n_Of his Authority to Hold an Inquest._—His authority to hold an\r\ninquest is not confined to the body of a person who may have died\r\nwithin his territorial jurisdiction, but extends to all bodies\r\nbrought within his jurisdiction, no matter where death may have taken\r\nplace.[520] So in any case where, after burial, an inquest becomes\r\nnecessary to determine the manner of the death of a person who, dying\r\nin one, is buried in another county, the coroner of the latter county\r\nis the proper officer to hold the inquest.[521] A coroner cannot hold\r\na second inquest while the first is existing. As we have seen, in\r\nholding an inquest the coroner performs a judicial duty, and he is\r\n_functus officio_ as soon as the verdict has been returned. He can hold\r\nno second inquest in the same case unless the first has been quashed\r\nby a court of competent jurisdiction, and a new inquiry ordered. He\r\ncannot set aside or quash his own inquest. If he were allowed to hold\r\ntwo inquests, not only might the greatest inconvenience arise from the\r\ninconsistent findings of the respective juries, but such a practice\r\nwould be liable to great abuse, and as the object of the proceeding is\r\nmerely preliminary, the main purpose being to ascertain whether it is\r\nprobable that a crime has been committed, and to examine the facts and\r\ncircumstances and preserve the evidence, all the ends of this inquiry\r\nare answered by one inquisition, _super visum corporis_. We believe no\r\nreported case is to be found in this country where a second inquisition\r\nhas been held, the first remaining undischarged, nor is any such\r\npractice known to or recognized by our laws.[522]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INQUEST MUST BE HELD UPON VIEW OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\nThe coroner can in no case hold an inquest except upon view of the\r\nbody. This is jurisdictional and cannot be waived by any one. He is\r\nnot bound to hold an inquest before burial of the body takes place.\r\nWhen it has been buried, and he believes an inquest necessary, he\r\nis vested with authority to have the body disinterred and hold his\r\ninquest, and if necessary direct a post-mortem examination to be\r\nmade, but after having done so, he must cause it to be reburied.[523]\r\nDeep interests are involved in the proper discharge of the duties of\r\ncoroners; the character, liberty, and perhaps the life of a citizen\r\naccused of crime on the one hand, and on the other the aiding of public\r\njustice in establishing the guilt and securing the punishment of the\r\nactual criminal. Many of the questions which fall within the scope\r\nof a coroner’s inquisition are of an intricate and most perplexing\r\ncharacter, a correct solution of which can only be arrived at by minds\r\nthe best instructed and habituated to their investigation. In many\r\ncases some of these questions can be satisfactorily settled by the\r\nevidence of persons having cognizance more or less direct of the facts;\r\nin others, however, they can only be solved by the facts deduced from\r\npathological anatomy, and other circumstances connected with the dead\r\nbody, the cause of the extinction of life in which is the subject of\r\nthe inquest.\r\n\r\n_In Massachusetts Office of Coroner Abolished._—Indeed, in\r\nMassachusetts the office of coroner was abolished in 1877, and the\r\ngovernor was invested with power, and it is his duty, to appoint, by\r\nand with the advice and consent of the council, able and discreet men,\r\nlearned in the science of medicine, to be medical examiners, whose\r\nduties are to make examinations as provided in the statute upon the\r\nview of the dead bodies of such persons only as are supposed to have\r\ncome to their death by violence.[524]\r\n\r\n_Coroner may Employ Professional Skill._—A thorough examination aided\r\nby professional skill is in general absolutely necessary to the proper\r\nadministration of justice. It would no doubt be strange if a coroner\r\nhad no authority to pledge the responsibility of the county for the\r\ncompensation of all auxiliary services which are necessary to the\r\nproper execution of his office, and which he can by no other means\r\ncommand; for instance, when his duty requires him to disinter a body,\r\nhe cannot be expected to do it with his own hands, or by hands paid\r\nfor with his means. Indeed it has been said that, in this enlightened\r\nage, a coroner who would consign to the grave the body over which he\r\nhad held an inquest, without availing himself of the lights which the\r\nmedical science has placed within his reach, would in most cases fall\r\nshort of what his official duty requires.[525] It is the generally\r\naccepted view of the law now that it is the duty of a coroner holding\r\nan inquest _super visum corporis_ to avail himself of professional\r\nskill and aid, and his contract will bind the county to the payment of\r\na reasonable compensation for making a post-mortem examination.[526]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nWhether such examination should take place before the coroner has\r\nempanelled a jury seems to be an open question. We would venture the\r\nopinion that it should not, inasmuch as the jury ought to see and\r\nview the body in the same condition, as near as may be, as it was\r\nwhen found, and not after it has been mutilated, as it must need be\r\nby a post-mortem examination. It is, however, settled that the post\r\nmortem should not be in the presence of the jury, and that they are to\r\nbe instructed by the testimony of the physicians who are designated\r\nby the coroner to make the examination.[527] The coroner’s right to\r\ndissect the dead body of a human being does not extend to all cases.\r\nSuch a power could be wielded with the most injurious effects upon a\r\ncommunity. His power to dissect is confined to those cases where he is\r\nauthorized by law to hold an inquest upon the body. But a post-mortem\r\nexamination, conducted by surgeons employed by a coroner holding an\r\ninquest, is not a part of the inquest in such a sense as that every\r\ncitizen has a right freely to attend it. At common law it was essential\r\nto the validity of a coroner’s inquisition that the jury should view\r\nthe body. And so is our law. But it was never required that the body\r\nshould be dissected in any case. It is discretionary with the coroner\r\nto cause a dissection to be made, and to select the surgeons. He has\r\nalso a discretion to determine whether any person, and what persons,\r\nmay be present besides the surgeons. Not even the jurors have a\r\nright to witness the examination. They are to be informed of what it\r\ndiscloses by the testimony of the surgeons. Indeed, no person has a\r\nright to be present at the post-mortem examination upon the ground that\r\nhe is suspected of having caused the death. He loses no legal right by\r\nbeing excluded. He has no right to dissect the body. If the coroner’s\r\njury pronounce him guilty, the inquest, like the indictment of a grand\r\njury, simply makes him liable to arrest.[528]\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS STATUTORY PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nThe statute law of Massachusetts has already been referred to. It\r\nhas abolished the office of coroner and in its place put medical\r\nexaminers, so called, who are presumed to be learned in the science\r\nof medicine. Their powers, however, are not co-extensive with those\r\nof coroners. A medical examiner cannot hold an inquest. He cannot\r\nhold an autopsy without being thereto authorized in writing by the\r\ndistrict attorney, mayor, or selectmen of the district, city, or town\r\nwhere a dead body lies. He can only upon receiving notice that there\r\nhas been found, or is lying within the county, the dead body of a\r\nperson who is supposed to have come to his death by violence, repair\r\nto the place where such body lies, view and take charge of the same.\r\nIf he deems a further examination necessary and is authorized so to\r\ndo, he must make an autopsy in the presence of two or more discreet\r\npersons, whose attendance he may compel by subpœna if necessary, and\r\nhe must then carefully reduce or cause to be reduced to writing every\r\nfact and circumstance tending to show the condition of the body and\r\nthe cause and manner of death, together with the names and addresses\r\nof the witnesses. If he deems it necessary, he may employ a chemist\r\nto aid in the examination of the body or of substances supposed to\r\nhave caused or contributed to the death,[529] the record of which\r\nhe must subscribe.[530] Such an autopsy does not, however, upon\r\nthe trial of an accused render other competent evidence, as to the\r\ncondition and appearance of the dead body at the time of the autopsy,\r\ninadmissible.[531] The autopsy may be followed by an inquest held, not\r\nby the examiner, but by a justice of the district, police, or municipal\r\ncourt for the district or city in which the body lies, or a trial\r\njustice. One of these functionaries must hold an inquest upon being\r\nnotified by a medical examiner that in his opinion a death was caused\r\nby violence, and after hearing the testimony draw up and sign a report\r\nand issue process for apprehension of a person charged by the report\r\nwith the commission of an offence, if he is not in custody.[532]\r\nEven though a medical examiner reports that a death was not caused\r\nby violence, and the district attorney or the attorney-general is\r\nof a contrary opinion, either one may, notwithstanding such report,\r\ndirect an inquest to be held in accordance with the provisions of the\r\nstatute.[533]\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK’S STATUTORY PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nIn New York the powers and duties of coroners are defined by statute.\r\nCoroners in the city of New York are governed by a special act relating\r\nto that city exclusively. For the State at large it is provided\r\nthat whenever a coroner is informed that a person has been killed\r\nor dangerously wounded by another, or has suddenly died under such\r\ncircumstances as to afford a reasonable ground to suspect that his\r\ndeath has been occasioned by the act of another by criminal means, or\r\nhas committed suicide, he must go to the place where the person is, and\r\nforthwith inquire into the cause of the death or wounding, and summon\r\nnot less than nine nor more than fifteen persons, qualified by law to\r\nserve as jurors, if such death or wounding be of a criminal nature, to\r\nappear before him forthwith at a specified place, to inquire into the\r\ncause of death or wound, and if it appears from the evidence taken or\r\nduring the inquisition, that any person or persons are chargeable with\r\nthe killing or wounding, or that there is probable cause to believe\r\nthat any person or persons are chargeable therewith, and if they are\r\nnot in custody the coroner must forthwith issue a warrant for the\r\narrest of the person or persons charged with such killing or wounding,\r\nwho must be arraigned before the coroner for examination, and the\r\ncoroner has power to commit the person or persons so arrested to await\r\nthe result of the inquisition. A coroner is disqualified from acting\r\nas such in any case where the person killed or dangerously wounded is\r\na co-employee with the coroner of any person or persons, association\r\nor corporation, or where it appears that the killing or wounding\r\nhas been occasioned, directly or indirectly, by the employer of the\r\ncoroner.[534] It is further provided that whenever a convict shall\r\ndie in any State prison, it shall be the duty of the inspector having\r\ncharge of the prison and of the warden, physician, and chaplain of the\r\nprison, if they or either of them shall have reason to believe that\r\nthe death of the convict arose from any other than ordinary sickness,\r\nto call upon the coroner having jurisdiction to hold an inquest upon\r\nthe body of such deceased convict.[535] The New York Criminal Code\r\nfurther provides that when six or more of the jurors appear, they must\r\nbe sworn by the coroner to inquire who the person was, and when, where,\r\nand by what means he came to his death or was wounded as the case may\r\nbe, and into the circumstances attending the death or wounding, and\r\nto render a true verdict thereon according to the evidence offered to\r\nthem or arising from the inspection of the body.[536] The coroner may\r\nissue subpœnas for and summon and examine as witnesses every person\r\nwho in his opinion, or that of any of the jury, has any knowledge of\r\nthe facts; and he must summon as a witness a surgeon or physician,\r\nwho must, in the presence of the jury, inspect the body, and give a\r\nprofessional opinion as to the cause of the death or wounding.[537] The\r\njury, after inspecting the body and hearing the testimony, must render\r\ntheir verdict, and certify it by an inquisition in writing, signed by\r\nthem, and setting forth who the person killed or wounded is, and when,\r\nwhere, and by what means he came to his death or was wounded, and if\r\nhe were killed or wounded, or his death were occasioned by the act of\r\nanother by criminal means, who is guilty thereof, in so far as by such\r\ninquisition they have been able to ascertain.[538] The testimony of the\r\nwitnesses examined before the coroner’s jury must be reduced to writing\r\nby the coroner, or under his direction, and must be forthwith filed by\r\nhim, with the inquisition, in the office of the clerk of the court of\r\nsessions of the county, or of a city court having power to inquire into\r\nthe offence by the intervention of a grand jury.[539]\r\n\r\nIf, however, the defendant be arrested before the inquisition can be\r\nfiled, the coroner must deliver it with the testimony to the magistrate\r\nbefore whom the defendant is brought.[540] If the jury find that\r\nthe person was killed or wounded by another under circumstances not\r\nexcusable or justifiable by law, or that his death was occasioned by\r\nthe act of another by criminal means, and the party committing the act\r\nbe ascertained by the inquisition and is not in custody, the coroner\r\nmust issue a warrant signed by him with his name of office, for the\r\narrest of the person charged.[541] The coroner has power to compel\r\nthe attendance of a witness and testify, and he may punish a witness\r\nfor disobedience, as upon a subpœna issued by a magistrate.[542] The\r\ncoroner’s warrant may be served in any county; and the officer serving\r\nit must proceed thereon, in all respects, as upon a warrant of arrest\r\non an information, except that when served in another county it need\r\nnot be indorsed by a magistrate of that county.[543] When the defendant\r\nis brought before the coroner, he must proceed to examine the charge\r\ncontained in the inquisition or information, and hold the defendant to\r\nanswer, or discharge him therefrom, in all respects as upon a warrant\r\nof arrest on an information.[544]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE JURY AND INQUEST.\r\n\r\n_Jurors Must be Sworn by Coroner._—The jurors summoned by a coroner to\r\nattend an inquest must be from the county or jurisdiction wherein the\r\ncoroner is empowered to act. He cannot proceed with the inquest until\r\nhe has summoned and sworn the jury. The jurors are not challengeable,\r\nand therefore they should be carefully selected and sworn by the\r\ncoroner himself. His duties are judicial and he can only take an\r\ninquest _super visum corporis_, and an inquest in which the jury is not\r\nsworn by himself is absolutely void and of no effect.[545]\r\n\r\n_They Must Investigate and Determine the Facts._—After being sworn\r\nby the coroner they must investigate and determine and are the sole\r\narbiters of the facts; the coroner’s duty being to instruct them in\r\nthe law. They must go, view, and examine the body together, and not\r\nseparately. It is essential to the validity of the inquest that the\r\njury should view the body.[546]\r\n\r\n_Coroner may Compel Attendance of Witnesses._—When the coroner sits\r\nto hold an inquest, he sits as a judicial officer, armed with all the\r\nordinary powers possessed by judicial officers. He may compel the\r\nattendance of jurors whose qualifications are usually such as are\r\nrequired of jurors in a court of record. It is his duty to present\r\nbefore the jury all the material testimony within his power, touching\r\nthe death as to the manner whereof the jury are to certify, and that\r\nwhich makes for as well as against the party accused. It is his duty\r\nto summon before his inquest every person whom he has any reason to\r\nbelieve possesses any knowledge relative to the death which he is\r\ninvestigating. He is to summon such persons to attend before him for\r\nexamination. He has full authority to compel obedience to his subpœnas.\r\nHe has this power by the common law.[547] If a post-mortem examination\r\nis made, the examining surgeons should testify before the jury as to\r\nthe matters disclosed by the examination.[548] The witnesses produced\r\nmust be sworn by the coroner, and their testimony reduced to writing by\r\nhim or under his direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHTS OF ACCUSED PARTY.\r\n\r\nThe coroner is not required to take the testimony of the witnesses who\r\nare examined before the jury in the presence of the party accused.\r\nThe accused has not the right to be represented by counsel, or to\r\ncross-examine the witnesses.[549] He is not permitted to produce\r\nwitnesses before the coroner to show himself innocent of the crime. The\r\ncoroner is not required to examine any witnesses to establish the guilt\r\nof such party when brought before him by virtue of process issued after\r\nthe finding of the inquisition.[550]\r\n\r\n_Deliberation by Jury and Return of an Inquisition._—After the\r\nevidence has been taken, and the jury instructed in the law by the\r\ncoroner, the jury should retire to deliberate upon their verdict.\r\nDuring such deliberation and until they have arrived at their verdict\r\nthe coroner should not be present in the room where the jury is\r\ndeliberating. After they have agreed on their verdict it should be\r\nreduced to writing, and the coroner is bound to accept it as final in\r\nhis court. The inquisition should then be signed by the coroner and\r\njury.[551] If the inquest is signed by the coroner and duly certified\r\nby him, the jurors having signed by making their cross marks, and the\r\nwhole being certified by the coroner, his certificate of the signatures\r\nof the jurors is sufficient and the inquisition is properly made.[552]\r\nIf several jurors on the inquest have the same christian and surname,\r\nit is not necessary in the caption of the inquisition to distinguish\r\nthem by abode or otherwise.[553] The law requiring the coroner to make\r\na return of the testimony with the inquisition cannot be satisfied\r\nshort of some official certificate indicating that the witnesses named\r\nwere sworn before him, to the matter insisted on as evidence against a\r\nprisoner. At least if there be no formal authentication, there should\r\nbe proof _aliunde_ that the memorandum presents the testimony of the\r\nwitness truly.[554]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE EFFECT OF THE EVIDENCE AND VERDICT.\r\n\r\nUnder the common law formerly, a coroner’s inquisition was equivalent\r\nto an indictment by a grand jury upon which the accused might be\r\ntried. But in this country no person can be tried upon a coroner’s\r\ninquisition, yet the inquisition of a coroner’s jury finding a person\r\nguilty of murder has about the same force against him, until the\r\ngrand jury passes upon his case, that an indictment found by them has\r\nthereafter, prior to his trial.\r\n\r\n_Coroner has Power to Issue Process of Apprehension._—If a person is\r\ncharged with the crime in the inquisition, the coroner has power and\r\nhe issues his process for the apprehension of the accused when not in\r\ncustody solely upon the inquisition. The inquisition, though taken in\r\nthe absence of the prisoner, and upon the testimony of witnesses he\r\ncould not cross-examine, settles the question of his guilt until the\r\ngrand jury passes upon the case. It justifies the commitment of the\r\nprisoner to jail, in the same manner that the testimony of witnesses\r\ndoes taken before a justice of the peace. The coroner can only examine\r\nthe prisoner in the same manner as upon a warrant of arrest or on\r\ninformation, and is not authorized to examine witnesses either against\r\nthe prisoner or for him, when he is apprehended by virtue of process\r\nissued subsequent to the finding of the inquisition by the jury, or in\r\ncustody of the coroner without process at the time the same is found.\r\n\r\n_Privilege of Prisoner upon Arrest._—The prisoner has the privilege\r\nof telling his own story before the coroner, which is to be returned\r\nwith the inquisition, and that is all. He cannot be discharged on it,\r\nhowever plausible it may be; and he has not the privilege of proving it\r\ntrue before the coroner. He should, therefore, not be discharged, and\r\nhe cannot have the case investigated again before it is passed upon by\r\nthe grand jury.[555]\r\n\r\n_Under the provisions of the New York Criminal Code_ the defendant\r\nagainst whom an inquisition has been found by a coroner’s jury is\r\nentitled to a hearing before a magistrate, whether he has been arrested\r\nbefore the inquisition has been filed or is arrested after such filing.\r\nUnder the provisions of sec. 779, in the case of a defendant who has\r\nbeen arrested before the inquisition can be filed, the prisoner is\r\nentitled to be examined before the magistrate, before whom he may be\r\nbrought, as provided in sec. 781, and in the case of a prisoner who has\r\nnot been arrested until after the inquisition was filed, under secs.\r\n781 and 783 the defendant is entitled to be heard before a magistrate\r\nin all respects as upon a warrant of arrest on an information. The\r\nmagistrate must proceed to examine the charge contained in the\r\ninquisition, and hold the defendant to answer or discharge him\r\ntherefrom.[556] The information is the allegation made to a magistrate\r\nthat a person has been guilty of some designated crime.[557]\r\n\r\n\r\n WHEN EVIDENCE TAKEN BEFORE CORONER OF A PARTY CHARGED WITH CRIME\r\n ADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE UPON HIS TRIAL SUBSEQUENTLY.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing which distinguishes between the proceedings of a\r\ncoroner’s inquest and any other official proceedings taken and\r\nreturned in the discharge of official duty as to their admissibility in\r\nevidence. A witness, therefore, may be contradicted by the production\r\nof a deposition thus given by him before a coroner.[558] But the line\r\nis sharply drawn in what cases the testimony of a witness examined\r\nbefore a coroner’s inquest can be used on his subsequent trial, and in\r\nwhat cases it cannot. When a coroner’s inquest is held before it has\r\nbeen ascertained that a crime has been committed, or before any person\r\nhas been arrested charged with the crime, and a witness is called and\r\nsworn before the coroner’s jury, the testimony of that witness, should\r\nhe afterward be charged with the crime, may be used against him on his\r\ntrial, and the mere fact that at the time of his examination he was\r\naware that a crime was suspected, and that he was suspected of being\r\nthe criminal, will not prevent his being regarded as a mere witness,\r\nwhose testimony may be afterward given in evidence against himself.\r\nIf he desires to protect himself he must claim his privilege. But\r\nif, at the time of his examination, it appears that a crime has been\r\ncommitted, and that he is in custody as the supposed criminal, he\r\nis not regarded merely as a witness, but as a party accused, called\r\nbefore a tribunal vested with power to investigate preliminarily the\r\nquestion of his guilt, and he is to be treated in the same manner as\r\nif brought before a committing magistrate, and an examination not\r\ntaken in conformity with the statute cannot be used against him on his\r\ntrial for the offence.[559] So the doctrine as to silence being taken\r\nas an implied admission of the truth of allegations spoken or uttered\r\nin the presence of a person, does not apply to silence at a judicial\r\nproceeding or hearing, and since the proceedings at a coroner’s inquest\r\nare of a judicial character, what there transpired must be considered\r\nas a part of the proceedings.[560] The leading cases which have been\r\nbefore the New York Court of Appeals upon this important question,\r\nand from which that court has finally deduced that rule, may be here\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n _Hendrickson Case._—In the first case the wife of the defendant\r\n died suddenly in the morning, and in the evening of the same day a\r\n coroner’s inquest was held. The defendant was called and sworn as a\r\n witness upon the inquest. At that time it did not appear that any\r\n crime had been committed, or that the defendant had been charged with\r\n any crime, or even suspected, except so far as the nature of some of\r\n the questions asked of him might indicate such a suspicion. On his\r\n subsequent trial on an indictment for the murder of his wife, the\r\n statements made by him at the coroner’s inquest were held admissible,\r\n on the ground that he was not examined as a party charged with the\r\n crime, that it had not appeared even that a crime had been committed,\r\n and that he had simply testified as a witness on the inquiry as to the\r\n cause of the death.[561]\r\n\r\n _McMahon Case._—Following this came the _McMahon Case_, in which\r\n it appeared that the defendant was arrested by a constable, without\r\n warrant, on a charge of having murdered his wife. The constable took\r\n him before the coroner, who was holding an inquest on the body, by\r\n whom he was sworn and examined as a witness. It was held that the\r\n evidence thus given was not admissible on the prisoner’s trial for the\r\n murder, and his conviction was reversed upon that ground.[562]\r\n\r\n _Teachout Case._—The doctrine of this case was more clearly defined\r\n and somewhat limited in a later case, the _Teachout Case_. In that\r\n case the defendant appeared at the coroner’s inquest in pursuance of\r\n a sub-pœna to testify, and voluntarily attended; he was not under\r\n arrest, but was informed by some one that it was charged that his wife\r\n had been poisoned and that he would be arrested for the crime. Before\r\n he was sworn he was informed by the coroner that there were rumors\r\n that his wife came to her death by foul means and that some of those\r\n rumors implicated him, and that he was not obliged to testify unless\r\n he chose. He said he had no objection to telling all he knew. The\r\n Court in delivering its opinion preludes it by a reference to these\r\n facts as showing that the statements made were voluntary in every\r\n legal sense, and held that a mere consciousness of being suspected\r\n of a crime did not so disqualify him that his testimony, in other\r\n respects freely and voluntarily given before the coroner, could not\r\n be used against him on his trial on a charge subsequently made of\r\n such crime. On that ground it held the evidence properly admitted,\r\n at the same time referring with approval to the _McMahon Case_,\r\n and distinctly limiting the rule of exclusion to cases within its\r\n bounds.[563]\r\n\r\n _Mondon Case._—Then followed the _Mondon Case_, where on the\r\n finding of the body of the deceased, the defendant was arrested\r\n without warrant as the suspected murderer. While he was thus in\r\n custody the coroner empanelled a jury and held an inquest, and the\r\n defendant was called as a witness before the inquest and was examined\r\n by the district attorney and by the coroner. The prisoner was an\r\n ignorant Italian laborer unfamiliar with the English language. He\r\n was unattended by counsel, and it did not appear that he was in any\r\n manner informed of his rights, or that he was not bound to answer\r\n questions tending to criminate him He was twice examined; on the first\r\n occasion the examination was taken by questions put either by the\r\n district attorney or by the coroner, and the result written down by\r\n the coroner, who then read the evidence over to him, line by line, and\r\n asked him if he understood it and if it was the truth, and he said it\r\n was, and the coroner then reswore him to the deposition. The coroner,\r\n after taking the defendant’s testimony on the first day, came to the\r\n conclusion that the defendant did not understand English well enough\r\n to be examined, and that it ought to be taken through an interpreter,\r\n which was done, in order that they might get it a little better and\r\n a little fuller. It was held that the defendant’s testimony was not\r\n admissible upon his trial on the indictment.[564] It will be seen that\r\n this latter case follows in direct line with the rule announced in the\r\n _McMahon Case_ and clearly distinguishes another case, the _McGloin\r\n Case_, upon the authority of which the trial court held the testimony\r\n of the prisoner in the _Mondon Case_ admissible.\r\n\r\n _McGloin Case._—The case of _McGloin_ was not that of the examination\r\n of a prisoner on oath before a magistrate before whom he was taken\r\n involuntarily, while in custody, and interrogated by the magistrate,\r\n who to all appearance had power to require him to answer, but while\r\n under arrest the prisoner said to the inspector of police who had him\r\n in charge that he would make a statement. The inspector then said\r\n that he would send for a coroner to take it. The coroner was then\r\n sent for and came to police headquarters and took down in writing the\r\n confession dictated by the prisoner, the coroner asking no questions\r\n and not acting in any official capacity, but as a mere amanuensis to\r\n take down the confession and prove the contents. It was held that the\r\n confession of the prisoner was admissible in evidence upon his trial\r\n for murder.[565]\r\n\r\n_Rule in Pennsylvania._—The rule in Pennsylvania is substantially that\r\nwhen the testimony given by the prisoner under oath before a coroner’s\r\ninquest, previous to him being charged or suspected of the murder of\r\nthe individual upon whose body the inquest was sitting, may afterward\r\nbe given in evidence against him, on his trial for the murder of such\r\nperson.[566]\r\n\r\n_Rule in Nebraska._—The statements of a prisoner to be competent\r\nevidence must have been voluntarily made. In cases of declaration\r\nmade on an examination before a coroner’s inquest by a person under\r\narrest or charged with the crime and also under oath, they are not\r\nadmissible. But when the person, although he be subsequently charged\r\nwith the offence, appears voluntarily, and gives testimony, before any\r\naccusation has been made against him, his statements are admissible in\r\nevidence against him on the trial of an indictment for the crime.[567]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICO-LEGAL AUTOPSIES.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nH. P. LOOMIS, A.M., M.D.,\r\n\r\n_Professor of Pathology in the University of the City of New York;\r\nVisiting Physician and Curator to Bellevue Hospital, New York;\r\nPathologist to the Board of Health, New York City; President New York\r\nPathological Society, etc., etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOPSIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MEDICAL examiner before proceeding with an autopsy, especially if\r\ncalled before the body has been removed from the place where it was\r\nfound, should carefully note certain facts. These should be entered\r\nby himself or an assistant with great care, in a note-book, as this\r\nbook can be introduced as evidence in any trial. A satisfactory way\r\nis to dictate to the assistant as the examination proceeds, and at\r\nthe conclusion the assistant reads the notes taken, and the examiner\r\nverifies them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURROUNDING OBJECTS—POSITION OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\nThese should be first noted. The character of the soil; the condition\r\nof the ground, and whether it shows footprints; if so, their direction;\r\nthe evidence of any struggle; the presence of any weapon; and finally,\r\nthe exact position in which the body lies, especially the position of\r\nthe hands and feet. This is important, for the body may be found in a\r\nposition which the deceased could not have assumed on the supposition\r\nof the wound or injury having been accidental or homicidal. If possible\r\na photograph should be taken of the body in the exact position in\r\nwhich it is found. If it is absolutely necessary to remove the body,\r\nit should be done with great care, keeping the body in as horizontal a\r\nposition as possible.\r\n\r\nThe character of the surrounding soil should be noted. This is of\r\nspecial importance when the body to be examined has been exhumed: for\r\nthe question of preservation of the body and the ability to recognize\r\npathological changes may be brought up at a trial. This was an\r\nimportant point raised in the Buchanan case (New York, 1893).\r\n\r\nIf a body be found in the water, examine the character of the water and\r\nthe temperature, and if found near the shore, the character of shore\r\nand bottom.\r\n\r\n=Blood.=—The situation of blood-stains, and their number and extent,\r\non clothing or surrounding objects should be noted. This will often\r\nshow whether a struggle has taken place after receiving the fatal\r\nwound, and is also of medico-legal importance if made at the time the\r\nbody is found, for it may be so situated as to show that the body has\r\nbeen interfered with after death.\r\n\r\nAgain, spots of blood found upon articles of clothing or upon\r\nsurrounding objects should be noted as to their form and direction, for\r\nthey may serve to furnish an indication of the position of the person\r\nwith respect to them when the wound was inflicted. For example, if the\r\nspot was oval, the presumption is that the person was placed obliquely\r\nwith respect to the stain while the hemorrhage was occurring. The force\r\nwith which the blood was thrown out will in some measure be indicated\r\nby the obliquity or length of the spot. The amount of blood will also\r\noften indicate whether the person has died suddenly, the exact spot\r\nwhere death occurred, whether a struggle took place, and will also\r\npreclude the possibility of a person moving after receiving the fatal\r\ninjury. When we examine a body, especially when found in a room, care\r\nmust be taken not to be misled by the accidental diffusion of blood by\r\npersons going in and out, or touching the body (see BLOOD-STAINS, Vol.\r\nII.)\r\n\r\n=Clothing.=—The examination of the clothing should be thorough. A\r\ndescription of each article should be noted, and the order in which it\r\nis removed; for often it is important to prove that the garments were\r\nworn by or belonged to the deceased. If any blood is on the clothing,\r\nnote whether the blood is in large patches, or whether it is sprinkled\r\nover the garment: the amount of the blood and what garments are stained\r\nby it. Note and examine whether the blood has flowed down the front\r\nof the clothing, whether it has soaked the inner garments, or again,\r\nwhether it has collected along the back; for these appearances will\r\nsometimes demonstrate whether a wound was inflicted while the person\r\nwas sitting, standing, or lying down. For example, if the throat is\r\ncut while the person is lying down, the blood will be found on each\r\nside of the neck along the back and not down the front of the body.\r\nFew suicides cut their throats in a recumbent position, and this\r\ndistribution of the blood may serve to distinguish a suicidal from a\r\nhomicidal wound.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the clothing may also serve to show whether there\r\nhas been any struggle, and the presence of dry spots or mud on it may\r\nsometimes serve to connect an accused person with an act of murder.\r\nThis is well illustrated in the case of Reg. _v._ Snipe, reported in\r\nBeck’s “Medical Jurisprudence,” where evidence was adduced to show\r\nthat some spots of mud on the boots and clothing of the prisoner, when\r\nexamined microscopically, contained infusoria, shells, and some rare\r\naquatic vegetables. The mud of the ditch close to where the body was\r\nfound, as also the mud on the clothing of the dead body, presented\r\nthe same microscopical appearances. The medical expert who gave this\r\nevidence swore that in his opinion the mud spots on the body and on\r\nthe prisoner’s boots were derived from the same ditch, for the mud\r\nof all the other ditches in the locality was found, on microscopical\r\nexamination, to be different. The well-known case which occurred in\r\nNew York a few years ago, known as the “Shakespeare case,” furnishes\r\nan example of the importance of carefully examining all stains on the\r\nclothing found on bodies.\r\n\r\nIf there are several stabs or cuts on the body involving the dress, it\r\nshould be noted whether they are blood-stained, and if so, whether the\r\nstain is on the inside or outside of the garments, for sometimes in\r\nsimulated personal injury a stain of blood may be inadvertently applied\r\nto the outside of the dress, as in wiping a weapon.\r\n\r\n=Weapons.=—If a weapon is found, the character of the weapon and its\r\nexact position should be noted. This is frequently of importance in\r\ntelling whether a person has died from an accidental or self-inflicted\r\nwound. In a case where death occurs immediately or within a few\r\nminutes, the weapon is found near the body, or often so tightly grasped\r\nin the hand that it can be with difficulty removed. If the weapon\r\nis found near the body it should be noted on which side and at what\r\ndistance, and it must be questioned whether it could have fallen on\r\nthe spot or been thrown there by the deceased. It is compatible with\r\nsuicide that the weapon should be found at some distance from the body.\r\nAn instance has been recorded where an individual was discovered in\r\nbed with his throat cut, and the bloody razor was found closed and in\r\nthe pocket of the deceased. If a weapon cannot be discovered, or is\r\nconcealed, it is strong presumptive evidence of homicide; especially\r\nwhen the wound is such as to produce speedy death.\r\n\r\nNote whether the weapon is sharp or blunt, straight or curved. If a\r\nknife, the handle and inner portion should be examined, for the blade\r\nmay have been washed.\r\n\r\nIf the wound has involved any large vessels, it is improbable that the\r\nweapon can have been thrown any distance from the body, and when it is,\r\nthere are always fair grounds to expect interference with the original\r\nposition of the body. One circumstance which always strongly points to\r\nsuicide is the finding of the weapon firmly grasped in the hand of the\r\ncadaver. The hand of a dead person cannot be made to grasp or retain\r\na weapon as does the hand which has grasped it at the last moments of\r\nlife. The amount of blood on the weapon should be noted, but it must be\r\nremembered that a knife may have produced a fatal stab wound and still\r\nno blood be found on it. This is explained by the fact that in a rapid\r\nplunge the vessels were compressed, and only after the drawing of the\r\nknife and relieving of the pressure blood began to flow, or possibly\r\nthe blood may have been wiped off the knife by the elasticity of the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nWhen a person has died of a gunshot wound, especially at close range,\r\nit is important to look for any wadding or paper found in the wound, as\r\nin a number of instances the finding of such has led to the detection\r\nof the criminal. For example, handwriting has been found on the paper,\r\nor it has formed part of a printed page the rest of which has been\r\nfound in possession of the accused. When a gun is discharged near the\r\nbody, a portion of the wadding is almost always found in the irregular\r\nwound produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nHaving completed the examination of the surroundings, one next proceeds\r\nwith the post-mortem examination, which should be conducted according\r\nto a well-defined plan, following which the results obtained will\r\nalways be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIf possible the body should be removed to a large, well-ventilated, and\r\nespecially well-lighted room. No artificial light, if it can possibly\r\nbe avoided, should be used when performing the autopsy; artificial\r\nlight is especially bad on account of its yellowness and its power to\r\nmodify natural color. Many diseased conditions cannot be satisfactorily\r\ndetermined by artificial light. The body should be placed on a high\r\ntable, and the facility with which the autopsy is made will often\r\ndepend on having the table high enough to render stooping unnecessary.\r\nNever make an autopsy, if it can possibly be avoided, on a body while\r\nin a coffin, as the examination is always unsatisfactory. The size and\r\nsurroundings of the room, and how it is lighted, should be entered in\r\nthe note-book.\r\n\r\n=Instruments.=—If possible the following instruments should be at hand\r\nbefore proceeding with an examination, although some of them may be\r\ndispensed with:\r\n\r\n(1) Large section knife; (2) scalpels; (3) enterotome (for opening\r\nintestines and stomach); (4) costotome, or large bone forceps (for\r\ncutting ribs); (5) scissors, large and small (one blade blunt); (6)\r\nsaw; (7) chisel; (8) dissecting forceps; (9) probe; (10) blowpipe; (11)\r\ncurved needles and strong twine; (12) measuring and graduated glass;\r\n(13) small scales.\r\n\r\nBesides the above instruments, some basins containing water; sponges,\r\nbottle of flexible collodion, Lugol’s solution of iodine for the\r\namyloid test, will be needed.\r\n\r\n=Post-Mortem Wounds.=—Various plans have been proposed to protect\r\nthe operator’s hands from the post-mortem wounds which are often so\r\ndangerous, such as wearing rubber gloves, smearing the hands with\r\ncarbolized vaselin, both of which have their disadvantages: the gloves\r\nbeing too clumsy, and the vaselin rendering it almost impossible to\r\nhold the knife steady. Gloves should always be worn, however, where the\r\nbody has undergone much decomposition, or where the person may have\r\ndied from any septic disease. A method which I have found satisfactory\r\nis to cover all cuts and hangnails with flexible collodion, and then\r\nto have a basin of clean water at hand, and from time to time to rinse\r\none’s hands in the water. It is from bathing the hands in the cadaveric\r\nfluids and not from cuts that most of the danger comes. If possible an\r\nabsolutely new board, large enough upon which to examine the organs,\r\nshould be at hand, for it may be claimed at a trial that the organs and\r\ntissues, if placed and examined on surrounding objects, have become\r\ncontaminated.\r\n\r\n=Toxicological.=—If a chemical analysis of the various organs and\r\ntissues is to be made, and it is impossible to have the chemist\r\npresent, the medical examiner should obtain some new glass jars of\r\nsuitable size, with close-fitting glass covers. These jars should\r\nbe rinsed with distilled water, and in them the various organs are\r\nto be placed; if possible with no preserving fluid on them. But if\r\nit is found impossible to deliver the jars to the chemist at once,\r\nalcohol may be poured over the organs in the jars, but it is specially\r\nimportant that a sample of this alcohol should be retained, that a\r\nchemist may at a future date test the same for any impurities. After\r\nthe organs and tissues have been placed in the jars, the mouths should\r\nbe closed and sealed, and the seal remain in the custody of the\r\nexaminer until the jars are delivered to the chemist.\r\n\r\n=Parts to be Preserved for the Chemist.=—In cases of suspected\r\npoisoning, it is not sufficient that the stomach and intestines alone\r\nshould be preserved for the chemist as has been indicated, each part\r\nby itself; for it should be remembered that the portion of poison\r\nremaining in the alimentary tract is but the residue of the dose\r\nwhich had been sufficient to destroy life, and if the processes of\r\nelimination have been rapid no trace of the poison will be found in the\r\nalimentary canal but can readily be detected in other organs. Again,\r\nthe poison may not have been introduced by the mouth, in which case\r\nnone may be found in the digestive tract.\r\n\r\nThe chemist should receive, besides the stomach and entire intestinal\r\ncanal, the liver, one or both kidneys, the spleen, a piece of muscle\r\nfrom the leg, the brain, and any urine found in the bladder.\r\n\r\nWhen it is impossible for any reason to obtain the whole of any organ,\r\nthe part removed should be carefully weighed and its proportion to the\r\nrest of the organ noted.\r\n\r\nIt is also of extreme importance to preserve in sealed and labelled\r\njars those parts of a body which may show the evidence of disease, or\r\non the appearance of which one’s evidence is founded.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF AUTOPSY.\r\n\r\nIn making the autopsy, the operator should stand on the right side of\r\nthe body and make the incision by grasping the knife firmly in the\r\nhand, and cutting with the whole of the blade and not with the point.\r\nThe knife should be swept along from the shoulder rather than from the\r\nwrist, thus making a long, smooth, deep cut; never a jagged one.\r\n\r\nThe method of examining the human body after death will vary somewhat\r\naccording to the objects in view. These objects may be threefold: (1)\r\nTo ascertain whether a person has died from violence or poison; (2) to\r\nestablish the cause of death, especially if it has been sudden; and (3)\r\nto ascertain the lesion of a disease, or to confirm a diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between a medico-legal and pathological autopsy\r\nis that in the former case everything which might subserve the ends\r\nof justice should be carefully noted, and the changes found most\r\naccurately described; especially any abnormalities found on the\r\nexternal examination of the body. A photograph should be taken of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe head should be opened and the brain examined first, and not last,\r\nas is often done in the ordinary autopsy.\r\n\r\nCareful notes should be taken during each step of the examination, to\r\nbe reread, verified, and signed at the completion of the autopsy.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that most of the lesions of disease which are\r\nfound, indicate the disease rather than the cause of death; that often\r\nthe lesion found will seem hardly extensive enough to cause death, and\r\nthat from accidents and injuries apparently trivial, death may result.\r\nIt must often be acknowledged that no sufficient cause of death can be\r\nfound, but the more accurate and careful the examinations (especially\r\nwhen a microscopical examination of the organs is made) the fewer will\r\nbe the number of such cases. If no apparent lesion is found, it must\r\nnot be forgotten that many poisons destroy life and leave no trace that\r\nthe pathologist can discover.\r\n\r\nCare should always be exercised not to mistake the ordinary post-mortem\r\nappearance which we find at autopsies for the lesions of disease.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the human body, whether it be made from a\r\nmedico-legal or pathological standpoint, is divided into two main\r\ndivisions:\r\n\r\n(1) The external examination, and\r\n\r\n(2) The internal examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nIts minuteness will depend on the character of the case, as when the\r\nperson is unknown, or when suspected to have died from unnatural\r\ncauses. In such cases the external examination is very important.\r\n\r\nThe following are the steps to be followed:\r\n\r\n(1) Give a =general description= of the body; apparent age, height, and\r\nweight of the individual; color of the hair and eyes; condition of the\r\nteeth; and the evidence of any personal peculiarities or abnormalities.\r\n\r\n(2) Note the =color of the skin= and observe whether there are any\r\nspots of CADAVERIC LIVIDITY, and if present where situated.\r\n\r\n(3) =Contusions.=—Note whether there are any contusions, and, if\r\npresent, their character, situation, length, breadth, and depth should\r\nbe described, and whether they are accompanied by inflammation or by\r\nthe evidences of gangrene.\r\n\r\nIt is often important to determine whether a contusion has been\r\ninflicted before or after death. This is to be done by cutting into\r\nthe ecchymoses and if the extravasated blood or the coloring matter\r\nof the blood is found free in the tissues, one can be almost certain\r\nthat it is an ante-mortem injury. In post-mortem discolorations the\r\nblood is found in the congested vessels. The situation of ante-mortem\r\ncontusions will not generally correspond to the discolorations produced\r\nby decomposition; the latter being confined to the most dependent\r\nparts. It should be remembered that the contusions produced by blows\r\non a body dead only a few hours cannot be distinguished from those\r\nwhich were received during life; and also that putrefactive changes\r\nmake it well-nigh impossible to distinguish between ante-mortem and\r\npost-mortem injuries. It should also be borne in mind that blows or\r\nfalls sufficient to fracture bones or rupture organs may leave no mark\r\non the skin (see WOUNDS, Vol. I., pp. 467, 474, _et seq._).\r\n\r\n(4) =Wounds.=—The situation, depth, extent, and direction of any\r\nwound should be recorded, as also the condition of its edges; the\r\nchanges in the surrounding tissues, and whether inflicted by a cutting,\r\npointed, or rounded instrument; or by a bullet. In the latter case the\r\ncourse and direction of the ball should be ascertained by dissection\r\nrather than by the use of the probe, and the character of foreign\r\nbodies, if any are found in the wound, should be noted. What nerves\r\nor blood-vessels, particularly arteries, have been injured, should be\r\nascertained. It is often important to determine whether a wound was\r\nmade before or after death. The following may serve as a differential\r\npoint: In all wounds made after death there is slight bleeding,\r\nnon-contraction of the edges, and absence of blood in the tissues. This\r\nis the opposite of ante-mortem wounds. Again, wounds inflicted within\r\ntwo hours after death cannot be differentiated from those made during\r\nlife (see GUNSHOT WOUNDS, Vol. I., p. 610 _et seq._; WOUNDS, Vol. I.,\r\np. 476 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n(5) =Fractures.=—If there are any evidences of fractures, the\r\nsituation of the bones involved should be noted, and whether they\r\nare accompanied by contusions of the soft parts. Fractures which are\r\ninflicted during life are always accompanied by much more extravasation\r\nof blood, more injury to the soft parts, and more evidences of reaction\r\nthan those occurring after death. It is a well-known fact that it is\r\nmuch more difficult to produce a fracture in a dead than a living body\r\n(see WOUNDS, Vol. II., p. 482 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n(6) =The temperature= of the body should be taken.\r\n\r\n(7) =The rigidity and flexibility= of the extremities should be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n(8) =The state of the eyes= should be noticed, and the relative size of\r\nthe pupils.\r\n\r\n(9) Attention should be paid to the condition of the cavities of the\r\nmouth and nose. The neck should be specially examined for marks of\r\nexternal injury, or signs of ecchymosis or compression.\r\n\r\n(10) =Genitals.=—The external genitals should be very carefully\r\nexamined for evidence of injury, the presence of syphilitic lesions,\r\nand in the female the condition of the vagina should be particularly\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n(11) =Œdema of the Feet.=—If there is evidence of œdema in any part of\r\nthe body, especially about the ankles, its situation and extent should\r\nbe noted.\r\n\r\n(12) =Ulcers and Abscesses.=—The situation and extent of any ulcer\r\nfound on the body should be recorded, as also the presence and\r\nsituation of any abscess.\r\n\r\n(13) =Burns.=—The extent of a burn, as also the state of the parts\r\ninvolved, should be noted. For example, whether they are inflamed or\r\nshow blisters, etc. (see HEAT AND COLD, Vol. I., p. 647 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n(14) =Hands.=—In medico-legal cases the hands of a dead person should\r\nalways be examined for the presence of cuts, excoriations, or foreign\r\nsubstances found upon them; especially should the dorsal extremities\r\nbe examined. This examination will often indicate that there has been\r\na mortal struggle before death. The impression of a hand or of some\r\nof the fingers is often found on the skin of a dead body. The exact\r\nsituation where found should be noted. This may be of importance, as\r\nwhen it occurs where it would have been impossible or improbable for\r\nthe deceased to have caused it.\r\n\r\nFor appearances in death from lightning or electricity, see Vol. I., p.\r\n701 _et seq._, and in death from hanging, strangulation, and garroting,\r\nsee Vol. I., pp. 713, 746, 781, _et seq._\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nHaving completed the examination of the external parts of the body, the\r\nnext proceeding is to open the body and make an internal examination.\r\n\r\nThis should be done by following a regular method, so as to examine the\r\nrelations of parts and not to injure one organ while removing another.\r\n\r\nIn opening the various organs an incision should be made which will\r\nexpose the greatest amount of surface at one cut. Never make a number\r\nof small and always unsatisfactory incisions in an organ. In opening\r\ncertain organs like the brain and heart, the incisions are so planned\r\nthat the parts of the organ may be folded together, and, if necessary,\r\ntheir relations to one another and the whole organ studied. Such organs\r\nare opened as one would open a book to examine its pages.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that after death the blood leaves the\r\narteries and left side of the heart, and collects in the veins and the\r\nright cavities of the heart. Especially does it collect in the vessels\r\nof the most dependent portions of the body and of the various organs,\r\nso that local congestions may often disappear after death; and again,\r\nthey may be found at an autopsy where they were not present during\r\nlife. Especially is this true of the mucous membranes such as those of\r\nthe trachea and bronchi, and also of the blood in the sinuses of the\r\ndura mater.\r\n\r\nIn making autopsies it is a cardinal rule that _all_ the cavities\r\nof the body should be examined, and not alone the one where one\r\nmight expect to find a lesion. At medico-legal autopsies, the great\r\ncavities—the head, the thorax, and the abdomen—should be examined in\r\ntheir successive order from above downward. The reason for beginning\r\nwith the head is that the amount of blood in the brain and its\r\nmembranes may be determined accurately; for, if the heart and great\r\nvessels of the neck are opened first, the blood will drain away from\r\nthe brain and local congestions disappear. In pathological autopsies,\r\nthe opening of the head first is not so important, and often the\r\nvertebral column need not be opened at all, for it is a complicated\r\nprocess and takes time; but in medico-legal cases, especially where a\r\nquestion as to the cause of death may arise, and has not satisfactorily\r\nbeen determined, after all the other cavities are examined the\r\nvertebral column should always be opened and the cord removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEAD.\r\n\r\nMake an incision across the vertex of the skull from ear to ear.\r\nDissect the anterior flap forward until within about three inches of\r\nthe bridge of the nose, and the posterior flap backward to the external\r\noccipital protuberance. Examine the internal surface of the scalp for\r\necchymosis and evidences of injury. A circular incision is then made\r\nwith a saw through the cranium as far backward and forward as the\r\nflaps have been reflected. An incision through the temporal muscle is\r\nnecessary so that the teeth of the saw may not become clogged by the\r\nmuscle fibres. When the cranium has been sawed through, a stout hook is\r\ninserted under its upper edge and it is removed with a quick jerk. If\r\nthe dura mater is very adherent to the calvaria, it may be necessary\r\nto remove it with the bone, by cutting through it at the level of the\r\ncranial incision. Examine the calvaria as also the other bones of the\r\nskull after the brain has been removed and the dura stripped off, for\r\nevidence of fracture.\r\n\r\nNote the symmetry, thickness, and density of the cranial bone, and\r\nremember that depressions along the sagittal suture are for the\r\nPacchionian bodies, and are not pathological.\r\n\r\n=Dura Mater.=—The dura mater may be slightly adherent to the bone\r\nof the cranium. This is especially seen in old people and does\r\nnot indicate disease. The Pacchionian bodies are seen along the\r\nlongitudinal sinus. Examine the internal surface of the dura mater\r\nfor the presence of clots, tumors, or inflammatory lesions. Open the\r\nlongitudinal sinus and examine for thrombi. Remove the dura mater by\r\nan incision following the cranial incision, the falx cerebri between\r\nthe anterior lobes being drawn back and divided. Note whether the dura\r\nmater is adherent to the pia mater, and the condition of its internal\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n=Pia Mater.=—The brain, covered by the pia mater, is now exposed.\r\nNote the degree of congestion of the membrane, its adherence, and the\r\nexistence of pus, blood, or serum on its surface or in its meshes.\r\nRemember that a considerable amount of serum may be present within\r\nnormal limits, especially in cachectic subjects, without indicating\r\ndisease, but when the serum is so extensive as to raise the pia mater\r\nand to depress the convolutions, we have a pathological amount which\r\nmay be a simple dropsy due to some general cause, or the result of a\r\nchronic meningitis. Enough serous effusion in the pia mater to produce\r\na condition which has been called by some writers “serous apoplexy,” I\r\nbelieve never occurs as a primary condition.\r\n\r\nLoss of transparency and thickening of the pia mater, especially along\r\nthe longitudinal fissure, is often seen in old people and does not\r\nindicate disease.\r\n\r\n=Brain.=—Remove the brain by raising the anterior lobes with the\r\nfingers of the left hand and cutting through the nerves, vessels,\r\nand the tentorium as they appear. The medulla is cut as low down as\r\npossible, and the brain as it rolls out is caught in the left hand.\r\n\r\nAfter being placed on a clean board or in a large clean dish, it\r\nis minutely examined. The average weight of an adult male brain is\r\nforty-nine and one-half ounces; of the female, forty-four ounces. Its\r\nproportional weight to that of the rest of the body is as 1 to 45.\r\n\r\nLay the brain first upon its convex surface and examine the arteries\r\nat the base for atheroma, thrombi, emboli, and aneurisms. Examine the\r\npia mater of the base, especially for the evidences of hemorrhage,\r\ntumors, tubercles, and inflammatory lesions. Next turn the brain over\r\non its base, and proceed to open its various cavities and examine its\r\ninternal structure. Separate the two halves of the cerebrum, until the\r\ncorpus callosum is exposed. Make an incision downward and outward at\r\nthe junction of the corpus callosum with the cerebrum, and the roof of\r\nthe lateral ventricles will be cut through and their cavities exposed.\r\nProlong the incision forward and backward so as to expose the cornua.\r\nThe size and contents of the ventricles should be noted, as also the\r\ncondition of the ependyma. The floor of the lateral ventricles being\r\nthe most frequent spot of hemorrhage, if one is found its extent and\r\nthe parts involved by it should be noted; especially its relation to\r\nthe internal capsule.\r\n\r\nTransverse incisions (about one-sixteenth of an inch apart) are made\r\nthrough the ganglia seen on the floor of the lateral ventricles. Thus\r\nany lesions in the substance of the ganglia will be disclosed. Three or\r\nfour longitudinal incisions are now made outward into the hemispheres\r\nnearly to the pia mater. These will divide the hemispheres into long,\r\nprism-shaped pieces held together by the pia mater and a little of the\r\ncortex, thus enabling the brain afterward to be folded together, and\r\nthe relations of lesions to the brain as a whole studied. The third\r\nventricle is now examined by cutting through the fornix and corpus\r\ncallosum at the foramen of Monroe. Next, the fourth ventricle is opened\r\nby a longitudinal incision through the lower portion of the vermiform\r\nprocess; its contents, the condition of its vessels and ependyma\r\nnoted. Then the floor of the fourth ventricle is divided by transverse\r\nincisions one-sixteenth of an inch apart, and careful examination made\r\nfor the presence of minute hemorrhages: for here is a place in the\r\nbody where almost a microscopical lesion (hemorrhage) may cause sudden\r\ndeath. Each hemisphere of the cerebellum is now opened by a number\r\nof incisions starting from the fourth ventricle and passing outward\r\ninto its substance. The presence of any tumors or hemorrhage in the\r\ncerebellum will now be recognized.\r\n\r\nIn opening the brain, when clots, areas of softening, tumors, etc.,\r\nare discovered, their exact location in relation to surrounding\r\nparts should be noted and the blood-vessels examined for areas of\r\ndegeneration or aneurism. This examination can be facilitated by\r\nallowing a stream of water to flow over the affected part. This will\r\nwash out the affected area and allow the vessels to appear.\r\n\r\n=Eye.=—In rare cases it may be necessary to remove the eye. This can\r\nbe done by breaking through the roof of the orbit with a saw or chisel\r\nand dissecting away the muscles so as to expose the optic nerve and the\r\nposterior portion of the organ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHORAX AND ABDOMEN.\r\n\r\nThe body being placed on its back, and the operator standing on the\r\nright side, an incision is made through the skin, fascia, and muscles\r\nfrom the top of the sternum to the pubic bone, passing to the left\r\nof the umbilicus and dividing everything down to the sternum and\r\nthe subperitoneal tissue. A small incision is now made through the\r\nperitoneum below the ensiform cartilage. Into this opening two fingers\r\nof the left hand are inserted, and by spreading the fingers and\r\nholding the knife horizontally the peritoneum can be divided to the\r\npubes without injuring the intestines. The skin and muscles are now\r\ndissected from the chest as far back as the false ribs. This dissection\r\nmay be facilitated by keeping the skin and muscles on the stretch and\r\ncutting with the flat part of the knife. In order to better expose the\r\nabdominal cavity, the recti muscles are divided beneath the skin at\r\ntheir insertion in the pubic bone. Examine the cut surface of the chest\r\nand abdominal muscles, and note their color, amount, and consistency.\r\nObserve whether the chest muscles show the evidence of any parasitic\r\ndisease such as trichinosis. The mammary glands are now examined from\r\nbehind and opened if necessary.\r\n\r\n=Superficial Examination of Abdominal Cavity.=—This should be done\r\nbefore opening the chest cavity, because the position of organs\r\nmay become modified, and blood and other fluids are liable to find\r\ntheir way from one cavity into another; and again, the blood in the\r\npresenting portion of the abdominal organs will change its color after\r\nexposure to the air.\r\n\r\nNOTE THE FOLLOWING POINTS: (_a_) The _relative position_ and _general\r\ncondition_ of the abdominal organs.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _color_ and _amount of blood_ in the presenting parts.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Whether there are any _signs_ of _inflammation_ or the evidence\r\nof foreign bodies or tumors.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Examine the _vermiform appendix_.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _The amount of fluid in the abdominal cavity._ Normally a small\r\nquantity of reddish serum will be found, particularly in warm weather,\r\nat the most dependent portion of the abdominal cavity. If the quantity\r\nis small it can only be ascertained by raising the intestines from the\r\npelvis. When the fluid is considerable, the exact amount should be\r\nascertained and its character noted.\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Perforation_, _invagination_, and _hernia_ of the intestines\r\nshould be looked for.\r\n\r\n(_g_) Determine the _height of the diaphragm_. Normally, on the right\r\nside, it is at the junction of the fifth rib with the sternum, and on\r\nthe left it reaches as high as the sixth. A variety of pathological\r\nconditions change its position. For instance, it may be raised when\r\nthe contents of the abdomen are greatly increased in volume, and in\r\nnew-born children who have never breathed. It may be depressed by\r\nenlargement of the lungs, disease of the heart, or fluid in the pleural\r\nor pericardial cavities. The presence of air or gas in the pleural\r\ncavity can be determined either by filling the abdomen with water and\r\npuncturing the diaphragm beneath the fluid so that the air will bubble\r\nup, or a puncture may be made through the thorax between the ribs, and\r\nthe flame of a match will be deflected by the escaping air.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHORAX.\r\n\r\nThe thorax is opened by cutting the sterno-costal cartilages as close\r\nto the end of the ribs as possible, the cut being made downward,\r\noutward, and backward, and the knife held obliquely so as not to injure\r\nthe underlying parts. Quite often the cartilages will be found ossified\r\nand it will be necessary to divide them by a costotome. Next, separate\r\nthe clavicles by a semi-lunar incision at their attachment to the\r\nsternum.\r\n\r\nRaise the sternum with the left hand and separate it from the\r\nunderlying parts. If there is any adherence of the sternum a slight\r\ntwist will be sufficient to remove it.\r\n\r\n=Superficial Examination of Thorax.=—Observe the position, color,\r\nand degree of distention of the _lungs_. It should be remembered that\r\nhealthy lungs, as soon as the chest is opened, owing to their inherent\r\nelasticity, will collapse, and when this normal collapse is not seen\r\nit is generally due to a loss of elasticity as occurs in emphysema,\r\nto inflammatory diseases binding the lung to the chest wall, or to\r\nthe alveoli being filled with solid or fluid substances or pent-up\r\nair. Most complete distention is seen when death is due to drowning or\r\nsuffocation.\r\n\r\nThe area of the _heart_ uncovered will vary according to the degree of\r\ncollapse of the lungs and to the abnormal size of the heart. Normally\r\nthe cardiac area exposed is quadrangular in shape, and about three and\r\na half inches in its longest diameter. Examine the _pleural cavities_\r\nfor the presence of adhesions, foreign bodies, or fluid. If fluid is\r\nfound it should be removed, measured, and its character noted. It\r\nis to be remembered that in warm weather, or when putrefaction has\r\ncommenced, a moderate amount of reddish serum is found in the pleural\r\ncavities which has no pathological significance. Lastly, examine the\r\n_mediastinum_ as to the condition of the _thymus gland_ and _great\r\nvessels_ outside the pericardium.\r\n\r\n=Pericardium.=—Open the pericardium by an oblique incision along\r\nthe anterior wall, and prolong this incision downward and outward\r\ntoward the diaphragm and upward to its reflection from the great\r\nvessels. Normally, about a drachm of clear serum, sometimes, however,\r\nblood-stained from decomposition, will be found in the pericardial sac.\r\nThe amount is best ascertained by raising the heart. Note next the\r\ncontents of the pericardium and whether there is any serous, fibrous,\r\nor purulent exudation. If an abnormal amount of fluid is present,\r\nremove, measure, and note its character. Observe whether there are any\r\nadhesions between the two surfaces of the pericardium. White patches\r\nare often seen on the visceral surface of the pericardium, especially\r\nover the ventricles. These have no pathological significance and are\r\ndue to slight thickenings of the pericardium.\r\n\r\n=The Heart.=—Having passed the hand over the arch of the aorta and\r\nnoticed whether there is any evidence of aneurism or dilatation, we\r\ngrasp the heart firmly by the apex, raising and drawing it forward.\r\nWe remove it by cutting through the vessels at its base. Test the\r\nsufficiency of the aortic and pulmonary valves by allowing a stream of\r\nwater to flow into these vessels, the heart being held in a horizontal\r\nposition and care being taken not to pull the valves open.\r\n\r\nTo apply the water test to the mitral and tricuspid valves, the\r\nauricles are first opened so as to expose the upper surface of these\r\nvalves, and by allowing a stream of water to flow through the aortic\r\nand pulmonary valves into the cavities of the ventricles, the degree of\r\nsufficiency of these valves can readily be ascertained.\r\n\r\nAnother rough test is what is known as the “finger test.” The mitral\r\nvalve will normally allow two fingers, held flat and in contact,\r\nto pass through its opening. The tricuspid in the same way allows,\r\nnormally, three fingers to pass; or if a more accurate test of the\r\ndegree of insufficiency is desired, the valvular orifices should be\r\nmeasured. Normally, the aortic orifice is one inch across; the mitral,\r\none and eight-tenths inches; pulmonary, one and two-tenths inches; and\r\nthe tricuspid about two inches.\r\n\r\nWe open first the cavity of the right ventricle by making an incision\r\nover its anterior border close to the septum. Prolonging the incision\r\ndownward to the apex and upward through the pulmonary artery, the\r\ncavity of the ventricle will be fully exposed. The left ventricle is\r\nsimilarly opened by an incision through its anterior wall which is\r\nprolonged upward through the aortic valve. The cavities of the auricle\r\nand ventricle, especially those of the right side, will often contain\r\nblood-clots. These clots are _usually_ post-mortem clots formed during\r\nthe last hours of life or after death. It may sometimes be necessary to\r\ndistinguish these post-mortem clots from what are known as ante-mortem\r\nclots. The latter are usually of firm consistency, dry, of a whitish\r\ncolor, and closely entangled in the trabeculæ, while the former are\r\nsucculent, moist, of a reddish-yellow color, and are easily detached\r\nfrom the walls of the heart cavities. Ante-mortem clots are rarely\r\nseen, and the medical examiner should be careful not to attribute the\r\ncause of death to the post-mortem clots which are so often seen. After\r\nthe heart is opened we can with more care and greater accuracy examine\r\nthe condition of the valves and recognize the extent of valvular\r\nlesions.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the endocardium should now be examined and any\r\nabnormality noted. Often it will be seen stained a deep red color.\r\nThis is not due to disease, but is caused by the absorption of the\r\ncoloring matter of the blood which has been set free by decomposition.\r\nThe size of the heart cavity and the thickness of the heart walls\r\nshould be noted, as also their consistency and color. It should be\r\nremembered that the heart walls may appear unusually flabby as the\r\nresult of decomposition, or apparently thickened when death occurs in\r\nextreme systole. The interior of the heart can be further examined by\r\npassing the enterotome into each auricle, carrying the incision through\r\nthe mitral and tricuspid valves to join at the apex with the previous\r\nincision, which has been prolonged through the ventricles to the apex.\r\nThus the auriculo-ventricular valves are completely exposed.\r\n\r\nHaving removed the blood from the heart it is next weighed. The average\r\nnormal weight of the human heart is about twelve ounces in the male,\r\nand a little less in the female: its size roughly corresponding to the\r\nclosed hand of the individual. Normally, the thickness of the walls of\r\nthe left ventricle about its middle is five-eighths to two-thirds of an\r\ninch, and of the right ventricle one-eighth to one-quarter of an inch.\r\n\r\nNote the condition of the aorta above the heart, whether it is dilated,\r\natheromatous, or shows calcareous deposits. Examine the coronary\r\narteries by opening them with a blunt-pointed scissors. Disease of\r\nthese vessels with thrombosis is one of the causes of sudden death\r\nwhich is often overlooked.\r\n\r\n=The Lungs.=—The lungs are removed by lifting them from the pleural\r\ncavity and cutting through the vessels and bronchi at their base. If\r\na lung is very adherent it is sometimes better to remove the organ\r\nwith the costal pleura attached so as not to tear the lung substance.\r\nExamine the external surface of the lung as to its shape, color, and\r\nconsistency. Next open the large bronchi with a blunt-pointed scissors,\r\nand prolong the incision into the pulmonary substance along the minute\r\nbronchi. Observe the contents of the bronchial tubes, the appearance of\r\nthe mucous membrane, and their relative thickness. Remember that it is\r\nvery difficult to tell the condition in which the mucous membrane was\r\nduring life on account of the early post-mortem changes which affect\r\nit, and also because the contents of the stomach may have been forced\r\nafter death up the œsophagus and down the bronchi, giving the tubes a\r\npeculiar reddish and gangrenous appearance.\r\n\r\nHaving examined the bronchi, the lung is turned over and its base\r\ngrasped firmly in the left hand. An incision is made from apex to base,\r\nwhich will expose at a single cut the greatest extent of pulmonary\r\nsurface. Note the color of the lung substance, and whether the alveoli\r\ncontain blood, serum, or inflammatory products. Blood and serum can\r\neasily be forced from the lungs by pressure between the fingers, while\r\ninflammatory exudations cannot. Examine carefully for the presence of\r\nmiliary tubercles.\r\n\r\nIf a question should arise whether a portion of a lung is consolidated,\r\nthis part can be removed, placed in water, and if the air cells are\r\nconsolidated the portion will sink; if there is only congestion it will\r\nfloat. By squeezing the lung between the fingers an inflammation of the\r\nsmaller bronchi (bronchitis) can be recognized by the purulent fluid\r\nwhich will exude at different points. It should be remembered that in\r\nnormal condition the lower lobes and posterior aspect of the lungs will\r\napparently be very much congested as a result of gravity.\r\n\r\n=Neck, Larynx, and Œsophagus.=—Throw the head well backward, and\r\nplace a block beneath the neck. Make an incision from the chin to\r\nthe upper part of the sternum. Dissect the soft parts away on each\r\nside from the larynx and thyroid body, then cut along the internal\r\nsurface of the lower jaw from the symphisis to its angle. Through this\r\nincision introduce the fingers into the mouth, and grasp and draw\r\ndown the tongue. By dividing the posterior wall of the pharynx and\r\npulling downward these parts, the trachea and œsophagus can readily be\r\nremoved together, a ligature having been first placed around the lower\r\nportion of the œsophagus. Open now the pharynx and œsophagus along\r\ntheir posterior border. Examine the mucous membrane carefully for the\r\nevidences of inflammation, caustic poison, tumors, foreign bodies,\r\nor strictures. With an enterotome open the larynx and trachea along\r\ntheir posterior wall. Observe if there is any evidence of œdema of\r\nthe glottis, and note the condition of the mucous membrane. Remember\r\nthat redness of the larynx is very commonly the result of post-mortem\r\nchanges and is also seen in bodies which have been kept cold. Dissect\r\noff and examine the thyroid gland.\r\n\r\n\r\nABDOMEN.\r\n\r\nHaving completed the examination of the organs of the thorax, we next\r\nproceed to examine those contained in the abdominal cavity. We first\r\nraise and,dissect off the omentum, noting if it is abnormally adherent.\r\n\r\nThe first organs to be removed are:\r\n\r\n=The Kidneys.=—Drawing the intestines aside we cut through the\r\nperitoneum over the kidneys, and introducing our left hand we grasp\r\nthe organs with their suprarenal capsules attached. Raising first one\r\nkidney and then the other, we easily divide the vessels and the ureters\r\nas close to the bladder as possible. The kidneys are often found\r\nimbedded in a mass of fat which must first be removed. Their surface is\r\nsometimes of a greenish color owing to the beginning of putrefaction.\r\nWe note the size of the organ, its color and weight. A normal kidney\r\nweighs from four and one-half to five ounces. Grasping the kidney\r\nfirmly in the left hand, we make an incision in its capsule along its\r\nconvex border, and with a forceps strip off the capsule and note its\r\ndegree of adherence and the condition of the surface of the organ;\r\nwhether it is smooth or granular. Prolonging our incision already\r\nmade through the cortex of the organ, inward toward the pelvis, we\r\ndivide the organ into two halves and now closely examine the internal\r\nstructure. The average thickness of the cortex, which should be about\r\none-third of an inch, is noted; as also its degree of congestion, and\r\nwhether the normal light (tubes) and reddish (vessels and tufts) lines\r\nare seen running through it. If these alternate light and dark markings\r\nare lost and the organ has not undergone decomposition, the presence\r\nof some of the forms of Bright’s disease may be suspected. If the cut\r\nsurface of the organ presents a waxy appearance, the amyloid test\r\nshould be applied by first washing the cut surface of the organ and\r\ndropping upon it a few drops of Lugol’s solution of iodine, when the\r\namyloid areas will appear as dark mahogany spots on a yellow background.\r\n\r\nThe pelvis of the kidneys should be examined for calculi and the\r\nevidence of inflammatory lesions. The suprarenal capsules readily\r\ndecompose, but if the autopsy is not made too late hypertrophy,\r\ntuberculosis, tumors, and degeneration in them may be recognized.\r\n\r\n=The Spleen.=—This organ will be found in an oblique position at the\r\nleft side of the stomach. Grasping it firmly in the left hand and\r\ndrawing it forward, it can easily be detached. Normally in the adult\r\nit is about five inches in length by three inches in breadth by one\r\ninch in thickness, and weighs about seven ounces. The size, color,\r\nand consistency of the organ should be noted, as well as abnormal\r\nthickenings of its capsule and the presence of any tubercles or tumors\r\nin its substance. The spleen softens very early as the result of\r\ndecomposition, and this decomposition should not be mistaken for a\r\npathological condition.\r\n\r\n=The Intestines.=—In cases of suspected poisoning the greatest care\r\nshould be taken in the removal of the intestines and the stomach.\r\nDouble ligatures should be placed in the following situations so as\r\nto preserve the contents of the organs intact: (1) at the end of the\r\nduodenum; (2) at the end of the ilium; and (3) at the lower portion\r\nof the rectum; and an incision should be made with a pair of scissors\r\nbetween these ligatures. The jejunum and ilium should first be removed\r\ntogether by seizing the gut with the left hand, keeping it on the\r\nstretch, and cutting with a pair of scissors through the mesentery\r\nclose to its intestinal attachment. The cæcum, colon, and rectum should\r\nthen be removed in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nThe intestines being placed in large absolutely clean dishes, which\r\nhave previously been rinsed with distilled water, are opened; great\r\ncare being taken that none of the intestinal contents are lost. The\r\nsmall intestines should be opened in one dish and the large intestine\r\nin another. A portion of the intestines where morbid appearances are\r\nmost likely to be seen in cases of poisoning are the duodenum, the\r\nlower part of the ilium, and the rectum. The comparative intensity of\r\nthe appearances of irritation should be especially noted. For example,\r\nif the stomach appears normal and the intestines are found inflamed the\r\npossibility of poison from an irritant may be denied.\r\n\r\nThe intestines are opened along their detached border by the\r\nenterotome. Care should be taken to distinguish the post-mortem\r\ndiscolorations which are usually seen along the intestines from those\r\nproduced by disease. The former are most marked in the dependent\r\nportions. They are apt to occur in patches which can be readily\r\nrecognized by stretching the wall of the gut. The darkish brown or\r\npurple discolorations which are sometimes seen as the result of\r\ndecomposition are due to the imbibition from the vessels of decomposed\r\nhæmoglobin. Much care and experience are necessary to tell the amount\r\nof congestion which is within normal limits and to recognize changes of\r\ncolor produced by decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe pathological lesions ordinarily looked for in the examination\r\nof the intestines are ulcers, perforation, hemorrhages, strictures,\r\ntumors, and the evidences of various inflammations. To obtain an\r\naccurate idea of the various portions of the mucous membrane of the\r\nintestines, it is sometimes necessary to remove their contents. When\r\nvery adherent this should be done by allowing as small a portion\r\nof distilled water as possible to flow over their surface. If any\r\nabnormalities are noticed along the intestinal tract, an accurate\r\ndescription should be given of their situation and extent; as also the\r\namount of congestion seen in different portions of the intestinal tract.\r\n\r\nIf possible the different portions of the intestines, as well as the\r\nstomach, should be examined immediately after being exposed to view,\r\nas under the influence of the air those parts which are pale may\r\nbecome red, and slight redness may become very pronounced. In this way\r\nonly can we estimate the degree of vascularity of the various parts\r\nafter death. However, in cases of suspected poisoning, _when it is\r\nimpossible for the chemist to be present at the autopsy, the medical\r\nexaminer should not open the stomach and intestines_, but place them\r\nin sealed jars. As soon as possible afterward, the chemist being\r\npresent, they should then be examined in the manner indicated. What\r\nmay be lost by waiting, in changes of color which have taken place,\r\nwill be more than counterbalanced by the data which the chemist will\r\nobtain from observing the contents and mucous membrane of the stomach\r\nand intestines when they are first exposed. The characteristic odors\r\nof certain poisons are so evanescent that they quickly disappear after\r\nopening of the stomach and intestines.\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough examination of the intestines, they are to be put with\r\ntheir contents into wide-mouthed vessels, each part by itself, and\r\nthe basins in which they were opened washed with distilled water and\r\nthe washings put into the same bottle. As soon as the intestines are\r\ntransferred to the jars they should be sealed.\r\n\r\n=The Stomach.=—The stomach and duodenum are removed together. They\r\nare opened by passing the enterotome into the duodenum and dividing\r\nit along its convex border, the incision being continued along the\r\ngreater curvature of the stomach as far as the œsophageal opening. They\r\nshould be opened in a large glass dish which has been carefully washed\r\nwith distilled water. The chemist and medical examiner will carefully\r\nnote the quantity, odor, color, and reaction of the stomach contents;\r\nalso whether luminous or not in the dark; the presence or absence of\r\ncrystalline matter, foreign substances, undigested food or alcohol.\r\n\r\nPortions of the contents should be placed in a small glass bottle and\r\nsealed, so that at a future time they may be examined microscopically.\r\nOnly in this way can an absolute knowledge of the character of the\r\nstomach contents be obtained. In certain medico-legal cases the ability\r\nto decide the character of the stomach contents is of the utmost\r\nimportance. The mucous membranes of the stomach and duodenum must be\r\nnext carefully examined for evidences of hemorrhages, erosions, tumors,\r\nand of acute or chronic inflammations. The appearance of the rugæ and\r\ntheir interspaces, principally in the region of the greater curvature,\r\nshould be noted; because here traces of poison and its effects are\r\nmost frequently seen. If the stomach is inflamed, the seat of the\r\ninflammation should be exactly specified, as also that of any unusual\r\ncoloration.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the blood-vessels are also noted. Vascularity or\r\nredness of the stomach after death should not be confounded with the\r\neffects of poison or the marks of disease. It may occur in every\r\nvariety of degree or character and still be within normal limits.\r\nVascularities which we might call normal are seen in the posterior part\r\nof the greater end and in the lesser curvature, and may cover spaces\r\nof various extent. Rigot and Trosseau have proven by experiment that\r\nvarious kinds of pseudo-morbid redness may be formed which cannot be\r\ndistinguished from the varieties caused by inflammation; that these\r\nappearances are produced after death and often not until five or eight\r\nhours afterward, and that they may be made to shift their place and\r\nappear where the organ was previously healthy, merely by altering the\r\nposition of the stomach. Ulcers, or perforations of the stomach as the\r\nresults of disease, as also the digestion of the stomach after death,\r\nhave been mistaken for the effects of _irritant poisons_.\r\n\r\nWhen perforation of the stomach is the result of caustic poisons, the\r\nedges of the opening are very irregular, and are of the same thickness\r\nas the rest of the organ. The parts not perforated are more or less\r\ninflamed, and traces of the action of the caustic are found in the\r\nmouth, pharynx, and œsophagus. This is the opposite condition to that\r\nseen in spontaneous perforation.\r\n\r\nIn considering perforation of the stomach the following points given by\r\nTaylor are well to remember:\r\n\r\n(1) A person may have died from perforation of the stomach and not from\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\n(2) A person laboring under disease may be the subject of poison.\r\n\r\n(3) A person laboring under disease may have received blows or\r\ninjuries on the abdomen, and it will be necessary to state whether the\r\nperforation did or did not result from the violence.\r\n\r\n(4) The perforation of the stomach from post-mortem changes may be\r\nmistaken for perforations from poison.\r\n\r\n_Corrosives_, if they do not produce perforation of stomach, will\r\ngenerally cause intense inflammation accompanied by softening of the\r\ninner coat, sometimes ending in gangrene. The inflammation varies as to\r\nits extent and intensity, sometimes affecting principally the mouth and\r\nœsophagus, but generally the changes are more pronounced in the stomach\r\nand duodenum, while in rare cases the inflammatory process may extend\r\nthrough the whole alimentary canal. The mucous membranes are sometimes\r\nbright red with longitudinal or transverse patches of a blackish color,\r\nformed by extravasated blood between the coats. _Carbolic acid_ often\r\nproduces in the stomach and œsophagus white patches—when these patches\r\nare carefully examined, an ulcerated surface beneath them is generally\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n_Narcotic Poisons._—It is a common but mistaken idea that these\r\npoisons produce some mark or characteristic effect upon the stomach\r\nwalls; that they induce a rapid tendency to putrefaction; that the\r\nblood is in a fluid state; that hemorrhages are seen in various\r\nparts; that the stomach and intestines show sloughing without any\r\ninflammation. Some of these conditions may and probably do occur, but\r\nthey are far from being invariable in their appearance. Experiments\r\nmade by Orfila on animals with narcotic poisons prove the above\r\nstatement. In conclusion, I would emphasize the fact that the _narcotic\r\npoisons produce no characteristic changes in the stomach that can be\r\ndetected_.\r\n\r\n=The Liver.=—The liver should be removed from the body and no attempt\r\nmade to examine the organ _in situ_. After raising first one lobe and\r\nthen the other, the diaphragm should be cut on either side and the\r\nsuspensory and lateral ligaments divided, then the organ can easily\r\nbe removed. The weight of the organ is ascertained, as also the\r\nmeasurements of its size recorded. The normal weight is from fifty to\r\nsixty ounces. The organ is normally about twelve inches in length by\r\nseven inches in depth by three and one-half inches in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe gall bladder is first examined to determine the character and\r\namount of the bile and the presence or absence of gall stones,\r\ninflammatory lesions, and tumors.\r\n\r\nAt autopsies the surface of the liver, especially along the free\r\nborder, is generally seen to be of a greenish or dark-brown color.\r\nThis discoloration is due to the action of the gases developed\r\nby decomposition on the coloring matter of the blood, and has no\r\npathological significance. The character of the surface of the liver\r\nis now noted, whether smooth or rough. The organ is opened by deep\r\nincisions in various directions, and the color, consistency, and blood\r\nsupply of the liver tissue carefully recorded. The presence of new\r\nconnective tissue, amyloid degeneration, abscesses, or tumors should\r\nnot be overlooked. It should be remembered that, of all the poisons,\r\nphosphorus alone leaves characteristic appearances in the liver.\r\n\r\n=The Pancreas.=—The pancreas is now easily removed, and its size and\r\nweight recorded. Normally it should weigh three ounces and measure\r\neight inches in length by one and one-half inches in breadth by one\r\ninch in thickness. The organ should be opened by a longitudinal cut and\r\nexamined for evidences of acute or chronic inflammation, fat-necrosis,\r\ntumors, calculi, and amyloid degeneration.\r\n\r\n=Genito-Urinary Organs.=—It is very important in medico-legal cases\r\nthat all the urine should be preserved and obtained uncontaminated;\r\ntherefore before the bladder is opened a catheter should be introduced\r\nand the urine drawn off into a clean bottle which has previously been\r\nrinsed with distilled water. If more convenient the bladder itself can\r\nbe punctured at its upper portion, a pipette introduced, and the urine\r\ndrawn off in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe genito-urinary organs are removed together. This is done in the\r\nfollowing manner. The body of the penis is pushed backward within the\r\nskin and cut off just behind the glans penis; the remaining portion of\r\nthe rectum is raised. This with the prostate gland, bladder, and penis\r\nattached is removed by carrying the knife around the pelvis close to\r\nthe bone and separating the pubic attachments. The organs are then laid\r\non a clean board and the urethra is opened on a grooved director passed\r\ninto the bladder, and the incision prolonged so that the internal\r\nsurface of the bladder itself will be completely exposed. Examine the\r\n_urethra_ for strictures, inflammatory lesions, and ulcers. Examine\r\nthe _bladder_ for congestion, hemorrhages, inflammation, and ulcers\r\nof its mucous surface, and note the thickness of its walls. Open the\r\n_rectum_ and examine for ulcers, strictures, tumors, and the evidence\r\nof hemorrhage. The _prostate_ gland is opened by a number of incisions\r\ninto its substance. Examine for hypertrophies, tumors, and inflammatory\r\nlesions. Force the _testicles_ through the inguinal canal, and cut\r\nthem off. Weigh, open, and examine them for evidence of inflammation,\r\ntuberculosis, and tumors.\r\n\r\n=Female Organs.=—Before removing these organs, any abnormalities such\r\nas adhesions, malpositions, and tumors should be noted. Dissect the\r\norgans away from the pelvic bones by carrying the point of the knife\r\naround the pelvis close to the bone. Cut through the vagina at its\r\nlower third, and the rectum just above the anus. The organs can now\r\nreadily be removed. Examine the _vulva_ for ulcers, hypertrophies, and\r\ntumors. Open and examine the _bladder_. Open the _vagina_ along its\r\nanterior border and carefully examine its mucous surface for evidences\r\nof inflammation.\r\n\r\nTHE UTERUS.—Before opening the uterus, its size and shape should be\r\nrecorded. The average normal weight of the organ is about one and\r\none-quarter ounces; its length three inches, breadth two inches, and\r\nthickness one inch. Open the organ along its anterior surface by a\r\nblunt-pointed scissors passed through the cervix, and the incision\r\ncarried as far as the fundus. Note the thickness of its walls and any\r\nabnormalities of its mucous membrane. During menstruation, the mucous\r\nmembrane of the body is thickened, softened, and covered with blood\r\nand detritus. Retention cysts are found in the mucous membrane of the\r\ncervix and are not generally of pathological significance.\r\n\r\nRemove, measure, and weigh the _ovaries_. Their normal weight is about\r\none drachm each; their size, one and one-half, by three-quarters, by\r\none-half inch. Open the organs by a single incision and examine for\r\nthe evidences of acute and chronic inflammations, tumors, and cysts.\r\nThe _corpora lutea_ in various stages can be easily recognized in the\r\nsubstance of the organ. Open the _Fallopian tubes_ and examine their\r\ncontents and the condition of their membranes (see DISPUTED PREGNANCY\r\nAND DELIVERY, Vol. II.).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPINAL CORD.\r\n\r\nTo remove the cord, the body should be placed on its face with a block\r\nbeneath the thorax. An incision is made through the skin and muscles\r\nalong the entire length of the vertebral column and the soft parts\r\ndissected away so as to expose the transverse process of the vertebræ.\r\nThe lamina are divided with a saw through the articulate process (a\r\ndouble-bladed saw specially adapted for this work can be obtained).\r\nAfter the lamina have been completely severed, these together with the\r\nspinous process can now be readily torn away with a stout hook and the\r\ncord exposed. A long chisel with a wooden mallet will often greatly\r\nfacilitate this work. Great care should be exercised not to injure\r\nthe cord. The roots of the spinal nerves are now severed, and the\r\ncord removed within its membrane. It should be remembered that serous\r\nfluid within the membranes of the cord, as also intense congestion,\r\nespecially along its posterior aspect, is often seen as the result of\r\npost-mortem change. The cord is laid on a clean board and the dura\r\nmater opened with a blunt-pointed scissors along its anterior aspect,\r\nand an examination made for the presence of hemorrhage, inflammatory\r\nlesions, and tumors. Softening of the cord can generally be detected by\r\nthe finger passed along it. This, however, is not a perfectly accurate\r\ntest, especially if the body has been dead some time. The cord is\r\nnow cut by transverse incisions about half an inch apart throughout\r\nits entire length, and the cut surface examined for the evidences of\r\ndisease such as hemorrhages, softening, and inflammatory lesions.\r\n\r\nAfter the cord has been removed, examine the vertebral column for the\r\nevidences of fractures and displacements.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE AUTOPSIES.\r\n\r\nLate autopsies are those performed after partial or complete\r\ndestruction of the soft parts of the body, through the natural\r\nprocesses of decomposition, or the examination of bones exhumed long\r\nafter interment. The term may be employed also to mean the inspection\r\nof an embalmed body, dead for some time.\r\n\r\nThe object of late autopsies is to determine identity, or to establish\r\nthe guilt or innocence of suspected persons. An examination of the\r\nskeleton even many years after death may give important information as\r\nto the manner in which the deceased came to his end. This cannot better\r\nbe illustrated than by the citation of one or two cases.\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated case of “Eugene Aram,” the bones of his victim were\r\ndiscovered thirteen years after the crime had been committed. A man who\r\nafterward proved to be Aram’s accomplice was arrested on suspicion. He\r\nconfessed the crime, and the opinion formed by the medical witnesses\r\nwas confirmed by his statements. The skull presented evidence of\r\nfracture and indentation of a temporal bone. Aram argued the case in\r\nhis own behalf, but the testimony was too strong against him: he was\r\nconvicted and executed.\r\n\r\nTaylor records the case of a man, Guerin, who was convicted of the\r\nmurder of his brother from evidence obtained from an examination of the\r\nskeleton three years after interment. Here, again, blows upon the head\r\nwere the cause of death, and the fractures were plainly perceptible\r\nupon the exhumed skull.\r\n\r\nAn autopsy upon a body before the soft parts have been entirely\r\ndestroyed, or upon an embalmed body, should be conducted in much\r\nthe same manner as ordinary autopsies. In these cases the method of\r\nburial should be noted. If it be a case of murder, and the body has\r\nbeen hurriedly put into the ground, it is not likely that the custom\r\nof Christian nations has been observed—that of laying the body full\r\nlength, with the head to the west.\r\n\r\nIn the case of partially destroyed bodies, the remaining soft parts\r\nwill give little evidence of the mode of death unless the violence has\r\nbeen very extensive, and even then it may be impossible to determine\r\nwhether a wound was inflicted prior to or after death. Recourse must\r\nbe had to the skeleton, and the only evidence it can furnish is of\r\nfractures, unless, as happened in one case, a rope be found about the\r\ncervical vertebræ.\r\n\r\nWhen the skeleton only is found, Taylor lays stress upon the following\r\npoints:\r\n\r\n(1) Whether the bones belong to a human being or one of the lower\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n(2) If a human being, whether male or female.\r\n\r\n(3) The length of time they have probably remained in the ground.\r\n\r\n(4) The probable age of the individual to whom they belonged. If the\r\nmaxillary bones be found, much information may be obtained from an\r\nexamination of the teeth.\r\n\r\n(5) The probable stature of the individual during life.\r\n\r\n(6) The race to which he belonged. The conformation of the skull and\r\nthickness of the bones will give important information on this point.\r\n\r\n(7) It should be determined whether solitary bones belong to the right\r\nor left side, and whether they form parts of one or more than one\r\nskeleton.\r\n\r\n(8) Whether they have been fractured, and if so, whether it occurred\r\nduring life, or by accident at the time of the exhumation. If it\r\noccurred during life, whether it be recent or of long standing.\r\n\r\n(9) The presence or absence of personal deformities, of supernumerary\r\nfingers or toes, of curvature of the spine, of ankylosis of one or more\r\njoints.\r\n\r\n(10) Whether they have been calcined, as murderers sometimes try to\r\nmake away with the bodies of their victims by burning. Especially is\r\nthis the case in infanticides (see IDENTITY, Vol. I., p. 408 _et seq._;\r\nTIME OF DEATH, Vol. I., p. 452 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOPSIES OF FRAGMENTS.\r\n\r\nThese cases are usually cases of murder in the perpetration of which\r\nthe criminal has mutilated the body with a view to destroying all\r\ntraces of identity.\r\n\r\nThe importance which attaches to autopsies of fragments rests upon\r\nthe fact that parts of a body may be found widely separated, and that\r\none portion may be found before the others. In such cases it will be\r\nnecessary to determine if they belong to one and the same body. The\r\nexamination is conducted chiefly with a view to establishing this.\r\n\r\nThe examiner must note the manner in which the fragment has been\r\nseparated; whether it is clean cut, as by one who understood something\r\nof anatomy, or, whether it has been separated roughly and by one\r\nignorant of the body structure. The determination of this point will\r\nbe one link in the chain of evidence which may lead to the detection\r\nof the criminal, or the acquittal of one accused. An anatomist or\r\na butcher would be likely to cut through at a joint, and to do it\r\nneatly. The exact point at which the severance has taken place should\r\nbe noted. The place of finding, the circumstances under which found,\r\nthe condition and general appearance of the fragment should all be\r\ncarefully recorded. The color of the skin will indicate with some\r\naccuracy the race to which the individual belonged. The probable\r\nsex may be determined by the presence or absence of hair, and the\r\ngeneral conformation. This, however, will not apply in the case of\r\nchildren. The probable age may be fixed upon from the size and degree\r\nof development of the fragment. The cut surface should be carefully\r\ndescribed, and if possible a drawing should be made of it.\r\n\r\nThere are special considerations which apply to certain parts of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n=The Head.=—The exact point of severance should be recorded. The\r\nnumber of vertebræ which remain attached to the head should be counted,\r\nand if the section pass through a vertebra, its number and the amount\r\nof it missing should be stated. The sex will be apparent in all\r\ninstances; the race may be determined both by the color of the skin\r\nand by the shape of the head; the age may be approximated, though care\r\nmust be had in expressing an opinion, for the manner of living is well\r\nknown to affect the appearance of age. Evidence of violence prior\r\nto death should be noted, and the presence or absence of fractures\r\nascertained; also observe the color of the hair and whether it be thin\r\nor abundant; the presence or absence of beard or mustache, and if\r\npresent the color; and the color of the eyes.\r\n\r\n=The Arm.=—The following points should be determined: the color of the\r\nskin as indication of race; the probable sex from its shape and general\r\nconformation; the probable age from its size and degree of development;\r\nmarks of any kind, such as tattooing; and deformities, such as signs of\r\nold or recent fracture, or dislocation; and supernumerary fingers.\r\n\r\n=The Leg.=—The examination of the leg should be conducted in much the\r\nsame manner as that of the arm.\r\n\r\n=The Trunk.=—An examination of the trunk will reveal the race, sex,\r\nand probable age, and may give evidence as regards the manner in which\r\nthe deceased came to his or her death. Any marks or deformities should\r\nbe recorded, and in all cases the viscera should be examined.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICO-LEGAL REPORTS.[568]\r\n\r\nAfter making a medico-legal autopsy, it will be necessary for the\r\nmedical examiner to draw up a report of his findings, and the\r\nconclusions based thereon. The report should be clear and concise, and\r\nthe language such as a coroner’s jury can understand. Technical terms\r\nshould be avoided, and when their employment is necessary they should\r\nbe explained in the margin or in parentheses.\r\n\r\nThe report should be drawn up in somewhat the following manner:\r\n\r\n1. When and under what circumstances the body was first seen; stating\r\nhour of day, day of week and month.\r\n\r\n2. When deceased was last seen living, or known to be alive.\r\n\r\n3. Any circumstances that would lead to a suspicion of suicide or\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\n4. Time after death at which the examination was made, if it can be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n5. The external appearance of the body: whether the surface is livid or\r\npallid.\r\n\r\n6. State of countenance.\r\n\r\n7. Any marks of violence on the person, disarrangement of the dress,\r\nblood-stains, etc.\r\n\r\n8. Presence or absence of warmth in the legs, abdomen, arms, armpits,\r\nor mouth.\r\n\r\n9. Presence or absence of rigor mortis.\r\n\r\nTo give any value to this point it is necessary for the witness to\r\nobserve the nature of the substance upon which the body is lying;\r\nwhether the body be clothed or naked, young or old, fat or emaciated.\r\nThese conditions materially influence the rapidity of cooling and the\r\nonset of rigor mortis.\r\n\r\n10. Upon first opening the body the color of the muscles should be\r\nnoted. Carbon monoxide poisoning causes them to be of a cherry-red\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n11. The condition of the blood and its color.\r\n\r\n12. The state of the abdominal viscera, describing each one in\r\nthe order in which it is removed (see p. 370). If the stomach and\r\nintestines are inflamed the seat of the inflammation should be exactly\r\nspecified; also all evidences of softening, ulceration, effusion of\r\nblood, corrosion, or perforation. The presence of hardened fæces in the\r\nrectum will bear evidence that no purging occurred immediately before\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n13. The state of the heart and lungs. (For special consideration of the\r\nlungs in cases of suspected infanticide, see Vol. II.; and of persons\r\ndrowned, see Vol. I., p. 805 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n14. The state of the brain and spinal cord.\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough consideration of the results of the examination,\r\nconclusions must be drawn from this examination; never from the\r\nstatements of others. The conclusions commonly relate to whether\r\ndeath was due to natural or unnatural causes; if to unnatural causes,\r\nwhat are the facts which lead the examiner to this opinion. As the\r\nconclusions are intended to form a summary of the whole report, they\r\nmust be brief and tersely stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PERSONAL IDENTITY,\r\n\r\n  INCLUDING\r\n\r\n  THE METHODS USED FOR ITS DETERMINATION IN THE\r\n  DEAD AND LIVING.\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n\r\n  IRVING C. ROSSE, A.M., M.D., F.R.G.S. (ENG.),\r\n\r\n  _Professor of Nervous Diseases, Georgetown University; Membre du\r\n  Congrès International d’Anthropologie Criminelle, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL IDENTITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\nIdentity is the determination of the individuality of a person. In\r\njurisprudence the term is applied to the recognition of a person who is\r\nthe object of a judicial action. The establishment of the individuality\r\nof a person is known as _absolute_ identity; while the relations of a\r\nperson with some particular act is known as _relative_ identity.\r\n\r\nThe great number and variety of facts concerned in the investigation\r\nof questions of identity are of considerable gravity and importance in\r\ntheir juridical bearing, and at the same time they are among the most\r\ninteresting and most useful of the applications of modern medicine to\r\nthe purposes of the law.[569]\r\n\r\nAmong the varied researches of legal medicine looking to an\r\ninterpretation of facts, no other question occurs in which the solution\r\ndepends more upon morphological and anatomical knowledge, and none is\r\nmore dependent upon purely objective, visible, tangible facts.\r\n\r\nPersonal identity often constitutes the entire subject-matter of\r\ndispute in a civil case. Upon it may depend the question of absence or\r\nof marriage, of kinship or of filiation involving the possession of\r\nan estate, in which case the court often requires the most subtle of\r\nscientific evidence to assist in its decision. Many anthropological\r\nand medical facts, now appropriated by criminology and penal science,\r\nare useful in proving not only the present but in attesting future\r\nidentity, thereby preventing in great measure the dissimulation of\r\nprisoners, deserters, false claimants to life insurance, fraudulent\r\npensioners, and the like.\r\n\r\nSuch matters are of daily occurrence. The special agents of the U. S.\r\nPension Office detect and cause the punishment of many fraudulent\r\nclaimants. Stratagems and conspiracies to defraud life-insurance\r\ncompanies go much further than mere substitution. Instead of a\r\n“fraudulent” a positive death may come up for investigation, and in\r\norder to defraud an insurance company of a large amount, a body may\r\neven be procured by homicide to consummate the deception, as was done\r\nin the Goss-Udderzook tragedy near Baltimore in 1872.\r\n\r\nA celebrated case now before the Supreme Court of the United States and\r\ninvolving the question of personal identity is that of the Mutual Life\r\nInsurance Company of New York, the New York Life Insurance Company, and\r\nthe Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut\r\n(Consolidated), plaintiffs in error, vs. Sallie E. Hillmon.\r\n\r\nIt is pre-eminently in criminal trials that the personal identity of\r\nthe victim often constitutes an essential connecting link. Before it\r\ncan move, the law requires, at the outset, proof of the individuality\r\nof both the author of a crime and of the victim. I shall, therefore,\r\nnot touch upon such elusive individuals as Charlie Ross and Jack\r\nthe Ripper, but limit my remarks to a synthetical exposition of the\r\nbest-known facts regarding identification of the dead body and the\r\ninterpretation of its organic remains.\r\n\r\nThe identity of a living person, or even our own identity, is often a\r\ndifficult point to establish. It may also require medical evidence,\r\noftentimes of a most involved character, to establish the fact of\r\ndeath. Hence the medico-legal process of connecting a dead body, or\r\nthe remains or traces of the same, with a human being once known to\r\nhave lived and moved on earth, is beset with difficulties that may give\r\nrise to still greater antagonisms of evidence. The question of personal\r\nidentity is one of the hardest that could possibly come before a court.\r\nCelebrated cases and judicial errors have given it great notoriety.\r\nThere are consequently few questions in forensic medicine that require\r\nmore attention and sagacity, and none upon which the medical legist\r\nshould pronounce with more reserve and circumspection. Medical men are\r\nabsolutely the _only_ persons qualified to assist in resolving the\r\nreally delicate question of personal identity; yet the physician and\r\nthe lawyer pursue the same line of logic and of inquiry. As the former\r\nmust have a subject to dissect or to operate upon, so must the lawyer\r\nin pursuing a criminal investigation first prove a visible material\r\nsubstance known in legal phraseology as the _corpus delicti_, which he\r\nmust connect with some personality, with some human being once known\r\nto have lived. In this important process the physician’s testimony\r\nbeing the indispensable guide of the court’s inference, he should limit\r\nhimself to purely anatomical and material knowledge. The medical expert\r\nhas absolutely nothing to do with guilt or innocence, as that is a\r\nquestion for the jury. He should, above all things, be absolutely free\r\nfrom prejudice, suspicion, or undue suggestion, and should remember\r\nthat in thus sinking his personality his sole function as a skilled\r\nwitness in cases of identity is to furnish testimony which, when taken\r\nin connection with other evidence in the case, may establish such a\r\n_corpus delicti_ as would justify the inference of a crime.\r\n\r\nA nice point may arise as to dispensing with the proof from the body\r\nitself, when the substantial general fact of a homicide is proved\r\n_aliunde_, as in the case of a criminal causing the disappearance\r\nof his victim’s body by means of its decomposition in lime or other\r\nchemical menstrua, or by submerging it in an unfathomable spot in the\r\nsea. Under circumstances such as the following: a person is seen to\r\nenter a building and is not seen to leave it, although all means of\r\negress therefrom are watched; another person is seen to ignite the\r\nbuilding, which thereupon burns down, and the charred remains of a\r\nhuman body are found in the ruins; the proof of identity from the body\r\nitself might be dispensed with in view of the substantial general fact\r\nof a homicide having been committed. In a delicate case where the man\r\nof art hesitates and finds no _corpus delicti_, the investigation of\r\nimprints and stains may give a clew of great value to the expert. Yet\r\nit is only upon absolute evidence, and in the strongest possible case,\r\nthat the fundamental principle of the _corpus delicti_ is disregarded.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Ruloff, the child’s body was not produced and no trace\r\nof it could be alleged to have been found; nevertheless the prisoner\r\nwas found guilty of murder. This case was speedily overruled (18 N. Y.,\r\n179), on the ground that a dangerous precedent had been pronounced.\r\n\r\nSo indispensable is the showing of the _corpus delicti_ in cases\r\nof recognition that lawyers have come to regard even the judicial\r\nconfession of an accused as often the flimsiest and most unsatisfactory\r\nkind of evidence. Numerous cases of demonstrated fallibility of\r\nconfessions are cited in the books, where the statement was utterly\r\nlacking in anything except motive or hallucination. In the Proceedings\r\nof the New York Medico-Legal Society, December 6th, 1876, Mr. James\r\nAppleton Morgan mentions the case of a German servant-girl who\r\nassured her mistress, whose little boy, a child of seven, had just\r\ndied and been buried, that she (the servant) had poisoned the boy.\r\nThe servant swore to her crime and was taken into custody, and it was\r\nonly when no poison was discovered upon exhuming the child’s body and\r\nexamining its stomach that against her own protest she was acquitted\r\nof the possibility of the crime. Another case of the kind that has\r\nhad medico-legal notoriety was tried a few years ago before a court\r\nin Brittany. The accused declared that he had killed his servant and\r\nthrown the body in a pond. His guilt seemed certain, when the alleged\r\nvictim put in an appearance, thus reducing the evidence to the strange\r\nhallucination that had prompted the confession.\r\n\r\nBut the most wonderful of these is the celebrated case of Boorn, in\r\nwhich medico-legal evidence took no part. In view of the seeming\r\nhopelessness of his case, the accused confessed to murder in\r\nexpectation of mercy from the court, but was finally acquitted on the\r\nalleged victim walking into court and confronting the man who had sworn\r\nto having killed him.\r\n\r\nAlthough wisdom and experience point to the necessity of showing\r\nsomething corporal and material in cases involving questions of life\r\nand death, yet very small traces or minute remains of a human body may,\r\nin certain circumstances, constitute a _corpus delicti_ that may lead\r\nto trial if not to conviction. In 1868 the Lambert case, for murder on\r\nthe high seas, was tried before Judge Benedict in the United States\r\nCourt, the only _corpus delicti_ alleged being a large pool of blood\r\nand brains found on the forecastle of a ship at sea, out of sight of\r\nland or other vessel. Circumstances, acts, and words pointed strongly\r\nto the murder of one of the crew, who was believed to have been brained\r\nwith an axe and thrown overboard. Notwithstanding the fact that\r\nanimosity was known to exist between the accused and the missing man,\r\nit further appeared that the accused, in a state of great excitement,\r\nhad followed the missing man forward and returned alone with a hatchet\r\nin his hand, yet the jury in this instance were not satisfied as to\r\nthe establishment of a _corpus delicti_ beyond a reasonable doubt and\r\naccordingly failed to convict.\r\n\r\nTwo classical cases, that of Gardelle and of Dr. Webster, mentioned\r\nin many of the books, stand forth as instances of conviction where\r\nfragments of the human body were recognized after attempts to destroy\r\nthem by intense heat. The conviction of Dr. Webster rested almost\r\nentirely upon medico-legal evidence; but it is probable that upon the\r\nsame circumstantial evidence the increased industry of counsel would\r\nhave so rung the changes in regard to its uncertain and unsafe nature,\r\nand would have so used the knowledge gained from advanced discoveries\r\nin the regions of the probabilities of science, as to have secured the\r\nacquittal of the prisoner had the trial taken place at the present time.\r\n\r\nA similar affair of great medico-legal interest is the Goss-Udderzook\r\ntragedy, already referred to, an account of which is given by Drs.\r\nLewis and Bombaugh among the “Remarkable Stratagems and Conspiracies\r\nfor Defrauding Life Insurance Companies,” New York and London, 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTITY OF BURNT REMAINS.\r\n\r\nThe medical jurist will no doubt find cremation a formidable barrier in\r\nelucidating the question of identity, although the entire destruction\r\nof a dead body is a matter of extreme difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the case of calcination chemical analysis of the ash would detect\r\nthe phosphate of lime, but this would throw no light upon the\r\nsubject, since the ash of human bones and that of the lower animals\r\nis identical. If the burnt bone is entire, the state of the epiphyses\r\nmay enlighten the question of the determination of age. The following\r\ntwo cases, in which fragments or portions of bone had been submitted\r\nto the action of fire, show how medical training and some knowledge of\r\ncomparative anatomy may contribute to the establishment of guilt or may\r\nattest innocence.\r\n\r\nIn the case of The Queen _vs._ John Henry Wilson, for murder, the\r\naccused burnt his step-father in a lime-kiln for over a week, and on\r\nstrewing ashes from the kiln fine fragments of bone picked up were\r\nafterward identified as human. At the trial identity rested on the fact\r\nof finding two buttons and a buckle, which were recognized as part of\r\nthe deceased’s wearing apparel when last seen.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, that of a young woman supposed to be in the family\r\nway who should not have been, it was thought that she had been confined\r\nand made away with the infant. Under this supposition the premises\r\nwhere she lived were searched by the chief constable, who found in\r\nthe stove some bones and fragments of bones that had been burnt. On\r\nexamination by a qualified medical man, the fragments turned out to be\r\nnot human bones, but those of some other animal, presumably those of a\r\npig and of a chicken, which the family, who lived in a tenement-house\r\nwithout a back yard, had put in the stove to get rid of the refuse.[570]\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTIFICATION OF HUMAN BONES.\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether certain bones are human or not, the medical jurist\r\nshould exercise great caution in venturing an opinion as to the precise\r\nanimal of which he may believe they formed a part. There is no great\r\ndifficulty in detecting the smallest fragments of bone by means of\r\nthe microscope, but we cannot say with safety whether the fragments\r\nbelonged to a mouse, a man, or an elephant. A real difficulty occurs in\r\nrecognizing the nature and origin of the bony remains when only a small\r\nfragment or a single bone is submitted for report. If a sufficient\r\nportion of the skeleton be submitted it can be easily recognized as\r\nhuman, as in the imbedded remains of the troglodyte found in the\r\nlimestone deposit of Luray Cave, Virginia, and only in the exceptional\r\ncase of the bones of one of the manlike apes could a difficulty of\r\ndistinction arise. The characteristic signs that distinguish a gorilla\r\nskeleton, for instance, are the smaller thumb; notable length of tibia\r\nand of radius, although this relative length of extremities has been\r\nremarked in negroes; small facial angle, 30° to 40° in the monkey, 70°\r\nto 80° in man; very inferior cranial capacity, the maximum in a gorilla\r\nbeing 550 cubic centimetres, while the minimum in the human species is\r\nfrom 970 with a maximum of 1,500 to 1,900 centimetres; a low index of\r\nthe foramen magnum; convexity of the squamo-parietal suture, and larger\r\nand more salient canines and incisors. The volume of the endocranium\r\nin the female gorilla, like that of the human species, is smaller\r\nthan that of the male; this difference being almost 80 c.c. for the\r\nanthropoid female.\r\n\r\nIn studying the osseous system it should be remembered that certain\r\nmodifying elements, as artificial compression, pathological\r\ndeformities, posthumous distortions, and hygrometric conditions, may\r\naffect particularly the skull, and if due allowance be not made for\r\nthese the study may lead to glaring absurdities. Not longer ago than\r\n1725 there was found in a quarry at Œningen the skull of a fossil\r\nbatrachian compressed into rude resemblance to the human cranium, which\r\nwas announced to the world as Scheuchzer’s “_Homo diluvii testis et\r\ntheoscopos_,” and as the remains of one of the sinful antediluvians who\r\nperished in the Noachic deluge.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE THE BONES OLD OR RECENT?\r\n\r\nAn important point may arise in questions of identification of bones as\r\nto the oldness: whether they are old or recent. The first indication\r\nis furnished by the presence or by the absence of the soft parts.\r\nThe existence of the periosteum and of the spinal marrow is the most\r\npersistent proof of a recent state; but these alone with the soft parts\r\nare usually destroyed in two or three years. In ordinary circumstances\r\na body becomes skeletonized in about ten years, although in exceptional\r\ncases the cadaver may resist decomposition after many years.[571]\r\n\r\nThis summer in transferring an old cemetery in Georgetown, D. C., the\r\nremains of the grandmother of one of the writer’s patients were found\r\nin such a state of preservation as to be easily recognized after fifty\r\nyears of burial. More recently, in unearthing the remains of an old\r\ngraveyard in East Washington, a striking peculiarity was noticed in the\r\nfact that many bodies of young people buried in recent years when taken\r\nup consisted of a few blackened bones and shreds of grave-clothes.\r\nwhile the remains of many older people buried long before the Civil War\r\nwere found in an excellent state of preservation. One of these was a\r\nMr. Fullin, who died from the effects of a sunstroke forty years ago\r\nand was buried in a metallic case. An old lady who attended his funeral\r\nwas present when his remains were unearthed and said they looked as\r\nnatural as when he was laid away in 1852. The features were well\r\npreserved and even the white linen of the shroud was unsoiled.\r\n\r\nAlterations in the texture of the bone, such as that caused by\r\ndryness and by diminution in the proportion of organic matter, may be\r\nascertained by histological examination, and one of the characters of\r\nage may be furnished by taking into consideration the specific weight.\r\nPlacing the skull at an average density of 1,649, that of an infant\r\nwould be 1,515, an adult 1,726, and that of old age 1,636.\r\n\r\nAscertaining the proportion of organic and inorganic matter, the\r\nphosphates and carbonates, by chemical means may furnish an additional\r\nhelp in the interpretation of the remains.\r\n\r\nWith all these diagnostic methods it may still be impossible to\r\nestablish identity either absolute or relative, even where a whole\r\nskeleton is in question. The evidence may, however, be of great\r\njuridical use to the accused, as in the case of Van Solen, tried for\r\nthe murder of Dr. Henry Harcourt, where the collective facts pointed to\r\nthe identification of a body dead two years. The jury, however, after a\r\nsecond trial, were instructed to acquit unless they were certain that\r\nthe remains were Harcourt’s. They acquitted, as no _one_ decided and\r\napparent feature was known to have existed by which the remains could\r\nbe identified beyond a doubt.[572]\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTITY IN CASE OF ENTIRE SKELETON OR IN CASE OF ISOLATED BONES.\r\n\r\nWhere an entire human skeleton has been discovered, the objects of\r\ninquiry here, as in the case of fragments or remains, are to establish\r\nthe identity of the victim and that of the author of the act, and to\r\ncollect all available information relative to the nature of the death\r\nand to the diverse circumstances attending the commission of the deed.\r\n\r\nIn gathering evidence from the examination of the skeleton or of\r\nisolated bones, with a view to find out the probable cause of death\r\nof the person of whom they form a part, a great variety of questions\r\nwill arise for consideration, such as those relating to race, stature,\r\nage, sex, and trade or occupation; the exterior signs furnished by\r\ndentition; the traces of congenital peculiarity or of injury, and the\r\nsigns of disease either hereditary or acquired.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF RACE.\r\n\r\nThe question of race in connection with the subject of identification\r\nis of more than usual importance in the United States, owing to our\r\nmotley population, composed as it is of aboriginal Americans, Chinamen,\r\nnegroes, and of Europeans and their descendants. I well remember the\r\nfirst human bones that I saw exhumed. They were discovered in digging\r\nthe foundation of a building near a kitchen-midden on one of the\r\ntributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. The apparent oldness of the bones\r\nand the finding of stone arrow-heads, tomahawks, and fragments of\r\naboriginal pottery in the immediate vicinity were additional accessory\r\nfacts that strengthened the presumption of the bones being those of a\r\nChoptank Indian.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, there is not much trouble in recognizing the\r\nplatycnemic tibiæ of the mound-builder, the skull of a Flathead Indian,\r\nan Inca skull, a negro skull, or even the skull peculiar to the lower\r\norder of Irish.\r\n\r\nIn many very old skulls a considerable portion of hair is often found\r\nattached. This of course may lend assistance in the matter of race\r\nidentity. A few years since I undertook at the Smithsonian Institution\r\na series of micro-photographs of the structure and arrangement of hair,\r\nwith a view to race classification as suggested by Professor Huxley.\r\nVarious specimens of hair from the yellow races were compared with\r\nthat of fair and of blue-eyed persons, with the hair of negroes, with\r\nreindeer hair, and with the hair-like appendage found on the fringy\r\nextremity of the baleen plates in the mouth of a “bowhead” whale. The\r\nexperiments, though far from satisfactory, were sufficiently conclusive\r\nto enable one to recognize approximately the horse-like hair of some of\r\nthe yellow races, that of the negro, and that of a blond Caucasian.\r\n\r\nBeyond the forementioned characteristics, the task of race recognition\r\nfrom observation of the skull is one of great difficulty and perplexity\r\nwith illusory results. A considerable experience of several years with\r\nthe large collection of skulls in the Army Medical Museum enables me to\r\nspeak advisedly on this point.[573]\r\n\r\nAlthough the technical procedures of craniometry require special\r\nmeasurements and employ an arsenal of special instruments, the results\r\nare far from conclusive as regards the determination of human types.\r\nTime and space do not permit the mention even in epitome of the\r\nvarious methods most relied upon by trained craniologists. Among the\r\noldest operations of cephalometry, as well as the most incomplete,\r\nis the measurement of the so-called facial angle, which is employed\r\nto distinguish the skull of a lower order of animal from that of the\r\nnegro and the white man. This angle, acute in the skulls of the lower\r\nanimals, approaches a right angle as we ascend the zoological scale;\r\nbeing from 30° to 65° in the various apes; 75° in the Mongolian; about\r\n70° in the negro, and between 80° and 90° for whites. The prognathous\r\n(projecting) jaws of the negro cranium are distinctive, as well as\r\nthe shape of the nasal opening, which in the black is an equilateral\r\ntriangle, while it is isosceles in the white. The books usually speak\r\nof the Eskimo skull as pyramidal, which in point of fact is not true.\r\nInspection and examination of a large collection of Eskimo crania\r\nhas changed and greatly modified some of the previous notions of the\r\nconventional Eskimo skull. From more than one hundred, collected in the\r\nvicinity of Bering Strait,[574] I find that the skulls present very\r\nconsiderable variations among themselves; some being brachycephalic,\r\nothers dolichocephalic. In many the facial angle is 80°, and in\r\none instance 84°, which exceeds that observed by me in many German\r\nskulls. Nor is the prominence of the zygomatic arches such a constant\r\ndifference in the configuration as to justify one in speaking of the\r\nskull as pyramidal. On the contrary, in many of the specimens lines\r\ndrawn from the most projecting part of the zygomatic arch and touching\r\nthe sides of the frontal bone, instead of forming a triangle on being\r\nelongated, might, like the asymptotes of a parabola, be extended to\r\ninfinity and never meet. The index of the foramen magnum in these\r\nskulls is about the same as that of European crania. The internal\r\ncapacity shows marked difference, the cubic contents of the endocranium\r\naveraging that of the French or Germans.\r\n\r\nAs some modern writers lay great stress on the measurement of the\r\ncranial capacity, not only as an aid to race identification, but as an\r\nadjunct in the study of the criminal and insane classes, it may not be\r\namiss to give the salient facts relative thereto.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that the cranial capacity may vary with the intellectual\r\nstate, hydrocephalic skulls, of course, being excluded. Microcephalic\r\nadults give a figure inferior to that of gorillas, some being as low\r\nas 419 c.c. Andaman Islanders and autochthonous Australians appear, in\r\nrespect to cranial capacity, to be most badly off. The capacity of an\r\nAndaman has been found as low as 1,094 c.c.; while that of Australians\r\n(autochthonous) and of some American tribes show an average capacity\r\nof 1,224 c.c. in the normal as well as in their deformed crania. The\r\ncranial capacity increases in the yellow races and attains its maximum\r\nin the white races. In the middle European race 1,500 c.c. may be\r\naccepted as the average; 1,750 c.c. is the maximum, and anything above\r\nis macrocephalic; while the minimum is 1,206 c.c., which is rather too\r\nlow than too high. According to Topinard’s nomenclature of the cranial\r\ncapacity, macrocephalic in the adult European male are those having\r\na capacity of 1,950 c.c. and above; a large skull is one of 1,950 to\r\n1,650 c.c.; average or ordinary, 1,650 to 1,450 c.c.; small, 1,450 to\r\n1,150 c.c.; microcephalic 1,150 c.c. and below. It would seem that the\r\nskulls of the insane are below the type, a measurement of sixteen male\r\nskulls giving an average of only 1,449 c.c. Scotchmen head the list\r\nwith the most voluminous skulls, and according to a tabular statement\r\nmade up from Welcker, Aitken, Broca, and Meigs, the English come next,\r\nwith a capacity of 1,572 c.c. Then follow Eskimo, 1,483 c.c.; Germans,\r\n1,448 c.c.; French, 1,403 to 1,461 c.c.; South African negroes, 1,372\r\nc.c.; Ancient Peruvians, 1,361 c.c.; Malay, 1,328 c.c.; Mexican, 1,290\r\nc.c.; Hottentot and Polynesian, each 1,230 c.c.; Australians, 1,364\r\nc.c.; and Nubians, 1,313 c.c. The cranial capacity in man, like that\r\nof the anthropoid apes, varies according to sex, the difference being\r\nso great that it is necessary to measure separately.\r\n\r\nIn the troglodyte skulls of prehistoric times the variation is not\r\nmore than 99.5 c.c.; but in the contemporaneous races the difference\r\nvaries from 143 to 220 c.c. French craniologists usually speak of the\r\nAuvernats as possessing the highest cerebral capacity (1,523 c.c.), and\r\nmention the skull of a Parisian of 1,900 c.c. as the highest known.\r\nSome Eskimo skulls, however, measure from 1,650 to 1,715 c.c., and\r\ntwo eurycephalic Indian skulls in the anatomical section of the Army\r\nMedical Museum measure respectively 1,785 and 1,920 c.c.\r\n\r\nMr. Havelock Ellis, speaking of the psychic characteristics of\r\ncriminals, says that the lower human races present a far larger\r\nproportion of anatomical abnormities than the ordinary European\r\npopulation; and Sir William Turner writes of the skulls collected\r\nduring the _Challenger_ expedition that although their number is\r\ncertainly too limited to base any broad generalization on, as to the\r\nrelative frequency of occurrence of particular variations in the\r\ndifferent races, there is obviously a larger proportion of important\r\nvariations than would occur in a corresponding number of skulls of\r\nthe white races. Thus, for example, the squamo-frontal articulation\r\nis found in less than two per cent of European skulls, while it is\r\nfound in twenty per cent of negroes, according to Ecker, and 16.9 in\r\nAustralian skulls, according to Virchow. Again, the spheno-pterygoid\r\nforamen is found in 4.8 per cent of European skulls and in 20 per cent\r\nof American Indians; 30 per cent in Africans; 32 per cent in Asiatics,\r\nand 50 per cent in Australians. The wormian bones are also more common\r\namong the lower races; as a rule, the cranial sutures coalesce much\r\nearlier and the teeth are more precocious.\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY, though of undoubted service in craniometry, has been\r\napplied as a crucial test in the matter of identity and found wanting.\r\nIt is objected to on the ground that it has no character of precision,\r\nand that photographs of the skull have the common defect of being\r\ncentral, not orthogonal projections, such as anthropometry requires.\r\nBesides, the lenses of cameras are not uniformly perfect. Anatomists\r\nknow, moreover, that salient differences in any collection of crania\r\nprevent methodical enumeration and constitute the stumbling-block of\r\nethnic craniology. Cephalometry shows, further, that dolichocephalic,\r\nmesaticephalic, and brachycephalic skulls do not belong exclusively to\r\nthe white, the yellow, or the black race, but exist among the three as\r\na result of evolution.\r\n\r\nOn this subject Professor Lombroso, among the foremost contemporaneous\r\nmedico-legal writers, cites the cranial asymmetry of Pericles, of\r\nRomagnosi, of Bichat, of Kant, of Chenevix, and of Dante, who presented\r\nan abnormal development of the left parietal bone and two osteomata\r\non the frontal bone. Besides, there is the Neanderthaloid skull of\r\nRobert Bruce and the ultra-dolichocephaly noticeable in the skull of\r\nO’Connell, which contrasts with the mesocephaly of the Irish. The\r\nmedian occipital fossa is noticeable in the skull of Scarpa, while\r\nVolta’s skull shows several characteristics which anthropologists\r\nconsider to belong to the lower races, such as prominence of the\r\nstyloid apophyses, simplicity of the coronal suture, traces of the\r\nmedian frontal suture, obtuse facial angle (73°), and moreover the\r\nremarkable cranial sclerosis, which at places attains a thickness\r\nof 16 mm. (five-eighths of an inch). Further mention is made of the\r\nsubmicrocephaly in Descartes, Tissot, Hoffman, Schumann, and others.\r\n\r\nDe Quatrefages noted the greatest degree of macrocephaly in a lunatic,\r\nthe next in a man of genius. Cranial capacity in men of genius is\r\nusually above the average, having been found as high as 1,660 c.c. in\r\nThackeray, 1,830 c.c. in Cuvier, and 2,012 c.c. in Tourgueneff. The\r\ncapacity is often found above the average in insanity, but numerous\r\nexceptions occur in which it drops below the ordinary average, as in\r\nthe submicrocephalic skulls of Liebig, Döllinger, Hausmann, Gambetta,\r\nDante, and Shelley.\r\n\r\nFrom what has just been said, it follows that skull measurements for\r\nmedico-legal purposes have no more significance than the fact that some\r\nmen are taller and some shorter than others. The medical jurist should,\r\ntherefore, not be too dogmatic in drawing conclusions as to race from\r\nthe skull alone. To complete the diagnosis in the matter of skeletal\r\nrace peculiarity, the splay foot of the negro with the unusual backward\r\nprojection of the heel-bone, as well as the greater relative length of\r\nthe tibia and of the radius, may be taken into consideration. There\r\nare other characteristics of the lower jaw and of the facial bones\r\ngenerally, the study of which leads up to the realm of transcendental\r\nanatomy; so their further consideration would hardly appeal to the\r\n“dispassionate, sympathetic, contemplative jury” of our enlightened\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF HEIGHT OR STATURE.\r\n\r\nWhen we have the entire skeleton to deal with, the height or stature\r\nmay be determined with a reasonable degree of certainty by allowing\r\nfrom one to two inches for the soft parts. Most of the proportions\r\ngiven in works on artistic anatomy approach mathematical exactness. For\r\ninstance, if both upper and lower extremities are extended after the\r\nmanner of spokes in a wheel, and a point corresponding to the umbilicus\r\nbe taken as a centre, the circumference of a circle described therefrom\r\nshould touch the bottom of the feet and the tips of the middle\r\nfingers. When the arms are extended horizontally the line included in\r\nthe middle-finger tips equals the height in the generality of men,\r\nalthough in exceptional cases it may vary. The negro giant, Nelson\r\nPickett, is reported to have been eight feet four inches high, while\r\nhis outstretched arms measured nine feet from tip to tip. Ordinarily\r\nthe upper part of the symphysis pubis is the centre of the body. Some\r\nanatomists contend that this important point is really below the\r\nsymphysis in the average man. The length of the foot about equals that\r\nof the head. According to Quetelet, its length is just one-ninth of the\r\nbody in women, a little more than one-ninth in men. The conventional\r\nrepresentation of the human foot with a second longer toe is, according\r\nto Professor Flower (see “Fashion in Deformity”), of negro origin and\r\ndoes not represent what is most usual in our race and time. Statistics\r\nof measurements made in England by several observers on hundreds of\r\nbarefooted children fail to show one instance in which _the second toe\r\nis the longer_.[575]\r\n\r\nTaken singly the bones may enable an approximate estimate of the height\r\nof the person when alive; but it should be remembered in connection\r\nwith this subject that the height is not a fixed quantity, since it\r\ndiffers according to upright or recumbent position, also before and\r\nafter a night’s rest. Moreover, the alleged height of the deceased may\r\nhave been taken in boots and is probably incorrect.\r\n\r\nMany tables of measurements have been constructed for the purpose\r\nof determining the height from the dimensions of the bones; but the\r\nrelation that exists between the total height and the dimensions of\r\ndifferent bones varies according to age, sex, asymmetry, and individual\r\npeculiarities, hence the tables will not bear the critical examination\r\nthat warrants their use with assured correctness, even in a majority\r\nof cases. The femur is the bone that gives the best results in these\r\nmeasurements. Isolated fragments have been included in the enumeration;\r\nthe nose and the middle finger multiplied by 32 and by 19 or 20 giving\r\nthe approximate height. While the foregoing calculations will not bear\r\nscientific scrutiny, they are of sufficient importance to be taken in\r\nconnection with other facts in determining the probable length of the\r\nskeleton. Among the most trustworthy of these tables are those of Dr.\r\nDwight, of Harvard University.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF AGE.\r\n\r\nThe age is a still more difficult matter to state precisely. Even\r\nduring life one may be as much as ten years out in guessing the age of\r\nan adult, while the error may be from fifteen to twenty years in the\r\ncase of a corpse. Dr. Tourdes mentions a case where the age was guessed\r\nas sixty and sixty-five in a deceased person aged eighty-five.\r\n\r\nThe state of the osseous system and the condition and number of the\r\nteeth, which strictly speaking are not bone, are among the surest\r\nguides in the determination of age. The signs furnished thereby may\r\nvary according to the periods of increase, maturity, and decline.\r\n\r\nDuring fœtal life and even at the epoch of birth the bone centres are\r\nfew. The distal end of the femur, the proximal end of the tibia, and\r\nthe astragalus are ossified at birth. Points of ossification appear\r\nin successive order of development. The exact period at which the\r\nbones begin to ossify and the progress of bony union being detailed\r\nin standard works on anatomy, it would be superfluous to repeat them\r\nhere. These changes are, however, not absolutely certain as to time\r\nand order, as the tip of the acromion process of the scapula sometimes\r\nremains ununited throughout life; the ossification of the sternum and\r\nof the costal cartilages is very uncertain, while the teeth, like\r\ncertain railway trains, are only due when they arrive.\r\n\r\nFrom the character of the progress of consolidation of the skeleton\r\nthe age may be estimated with a reasonable approach to accuracy up to\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years, which is the stationary period as regards\r\nalteration in the osseous system. Above this period it is difficult\r\nto arrive at the age. About forty the cranial sutures[576] begin to\r\ndisappear, although the time of the closure of the sutures varies\r\nwithin large limits; the coccyx becomes consolidated; ossification\r\nbegins in the thyroid cartilage and in that of the first rib (although\r\nthis state of the rib is regarded by many as pathological); the\r\nlower jaw, which in the fœtus and in infancy formed an obtuse angle,\r\nnow assumes nearly a right angle. As senility progresses toward\r\ndecrepitude, the bones become lighter and more brittle, owing to\r\nfatty atrophy, and their medullary canal larger; the jaw returns to\r\nits infantile shape from loss of teeth and atrophy of the alveolar\r\nprocesses; the bodies of the vertebræ (according to some authorities)\r\nbevel off in front; osteophytes are formed, and the neck of the femur\r\napproaches the horizontal. (See Abortion and Infanticide.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF SEX.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of sex there should be no difficulty, after noting the\r\nproof furnished by the aggregate characteristics of both male and\r\nfemale skeletons. The points of contrast between the two skeletons\r\nare not so striking before the age of puberty. Generally speaking the\r\ncranial capacity of an adult woman is less, although it is contended\r\nthat since the great majority of males of the human species are taller,\r\nheavier, and larger than the females, it follows that if due allowance\r\nbe made for these variations, it will appear that the brain capacity\r\nof woman is relatively very little, if at all, inferior to that of\r\nman. The mastoid processes of the female skull are smaller; the lower\r\njaw-bone is relatively smaller and lighter; the ribs are lighter and\r\ncompressed; the spine is relatively longer; the collar and shoulder\r\nbones and the sternum[577] are smaller and lighter; there is a less\r\npronounced angle in the femur, the neck of which approaches a right\r\nangle, while smallness of the patella in front and narrowness of the\r\narticulating surfaces of the tibia and femur, which in man form the\r\nlateral prominences, are said to make the knee-joint in women a sexual\r\ncharacteristic. But it is the striking contrast in the pelvis that\r\nfurnishes a sexual significance that is of greater value than all the\r\nrest of the skeleton together. From a glance at the text-book account\r\nof the pelvis, it does not appear that much anatomical knowledge is\r\nnecessary to identify the important points that give shape to the\r\nfemale pelvis. Its greater diameter (except the vertical), larger and\r\nmore curved sacrum and coccyx, and great spread of the arch of the\r\npubes are well-nigh incontestible signs. The differences as detailed\r\nin the books can be objected to only on the possibility of a so-called\r\nhermaphrodite pelvis in one of the other sex. We sometimes see a very\r\nlarge pelvis in a subject who by a teratological freak became a man.\r\nMasculine characteristics are, however, oftener found in women than\r\nfeminine characteristics in men; hence the conclusion that the presence\r\nof feminine characteristics leaves but little doubt as to the sex, but\r\nthat certain masculine indications, while giving a great probability\r\nfor the male sex, are not absolutely decisive. (See Hermaphroditism.)\r\n\r\nThe finding of fœtal bones around or about the supposed female skeleton\r\nis suggestive. It could not be inferred from this fact alone that the\r\nwoman was or was not pregnant at the time of death, since the absence\r\nof fœtal remains on the one hand might imply their entire decomposition\r\nin advance of those of the adult; on the other hand, the indiscriminate\r\nhabit of undertakers, who often bury still-borns with adults, may\r\naccount for their presence.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL SIGNS AND EVOLUTION OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\nThe trade or occupation leaves but few marks on the bones that are\r\nuseful in the matter of identification. It is in the recent and\r\nwell-preserved cadaver, or, better still, in the living subject, that\r\nthe _professional signs_ are of importance. As a rule, the relatively\r\nlarger scapulæ point to the fact of a day-laborer; necrosis of the\r\nlower jaw suggests a worker in phosphorus; worn and discolored teeth\r\na user of tobacco, and aurification of the teeth might suggest the\r\nprevious social condition. Gold crowns and fillings and dental\r\nprosthesis generally are among the most common and, at the same time,\r\namong the most useful signs of identification. By this means the bones\r\nof persons killed by Indians on the Western plains have been recognized\r\nyears afterward. The traveller Powell, massacred in Abyssinia, was\r\nrecognized in this way. From the presence of artificial teeth and the\r\nmechanical appliances for fixing them, dentists may recognize their\r\nown work beyond a doubt. One of the most common-hackneyed of these\r\ncases is that of Professor Webster.[578] Later cases, in which this\r\nkind of proof established convincing and conclusive identification,\r\nare those of Dr. Cronin, assassinated in Chicago in 1889, and of the\r\nbomb-thrower, Norcross. Every now and then accounts appear in the daily\r\npress of corpses having been recognized by inspection of the teeth.\r\nIn Washington, only a short time since, the remains of an unknown\r\nman were exhumed from the Potter’s Field for judicial reasons. The\r\nunrecognized body had been found in the Potomac in an advanced stage\r\nof decomposition. From the signs furnished by the teeth the remains\r\nwere identified as those of a person who had disappeared mysteriously\r\nand under circumstances that pointed to his having been murdered\r\nat a Virginian gambling den, and his body thrown into the river.\r\nIn connection with this subject the Goss-Udderzook tragedy is of\r\ninstructive interest.\r\n\r\nIn every important case a cast of the mouth should be taken, in order\r\nto set at rest any question that may subsequently arise as to the\r\ncondition of the jaw, the absence of teeth, their irregularity or\r\nother dental peculiarities. A cast of the mouth of the deceased in the\r\nHillmon case showed all the teeth to be regular and perfect, while\r\nit is alleged that Hillmon’s teeth were just the opposite. External\r\nsigns furnished by dentition may assist greatly in fixing both age and\r\nidentity. The evolution of the human dental system has been so well\r\nstudied from intra-uterine life to old age that we may approximately\r\ntell the age, especially of children, from the teeth alone. This sign,\r\nso valuable in childhood, loses its value as the dentition progresses.\r\nElaborate tables and dental formulæ to be found elsewhere deal with\r\nthe two periods of dentition, the relative position and number of the\r\nteeth, and the like.\r\n\r\nAt birth the jaws show points of ossification only; but children are\r\nsometimes born with central incisors, as the writer has, in common\r\nwith others, noted in several instances. The _first dentition_ takes\r\nplace from the seventh to the thirtieth month; the _second_ between\r\nfour and five years. In rachitic children these periods are later;\r\nbut a syphilitic taint may hasten their development. The twenty-eight\r\nteeth characterize early youth. Wisdom teeth appear between eighteen\r\nand twenty-five, sometimes as late as thirty years. The presence of\r\nthirty-two teeth indicates maturity. This number is sometimes exceeded.\r\nDr. Tidy, in his work on “Legal Medicine,” reports having seen several\r\nchildren between six and seven years with forty-eight teeth. Instances\r\nare recorded of cutting the teeth at advanced age, seventy and one\r\nhundred and eighteen years; of adults who have never had teeth; of\r\nsupernumerary teeth, and of a third dentition. What purported to be a\r\nthird dentition came under my notice some years ago, in the person of\r\nan old negro “voodoo doctor.” A more recent case, said to have occurred\r\nin an old man of seventy-four, at Seymour, Ind., is reported in the\r\n_Weekly Medical Review_, St. Louis, Mo., April 16th, 1892, p. 314.\r\n\r\nThe pathological signs furnished by the teeth should, of course, be\r\nlooked upon as a personal characteristic that may lend additional light\r\nin the question of identity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGENITAL PECULIARITIES, DEFORMITIES, AND INJURIES.\r\n\r\nBut congenital peculiarities or injuries of other parts of the skeleton\r\nare studied to greater advantage in determining proof or disproof of\r\nidentity. We may recognize cranial asymmetry; the peculiar conformation\r\nof the idiot skull; the prognathous skull of the negro; the pyramidal\r\nskull of some of the yellow races, and the oval head of the white\r\nman; besides the ethnic artificial deformities already touched upon\r\nin considering the question of race. A metopic cranium, a cleft\r\npalate, a deformed spine or pelvis, a larger left scapula—indicative\r\nof left-handedness; a shortened extremity; bowed legs, club foot, the\r\npresence of extra fingers or toes, and the relative length of the\r\nfingers are each and all valuable facts in judiciary anthropology. In\r\nwomen of Spanish extraction the fifth finger is almost as long as the\r\nfourth—a fact so well known that glove-makers take advantage of it in\r\nsending gloves to Mexico, the Antilles, or to South America.\r\n\r\nAn estimate of the length of the hand seems to be a matter of\r\ndifficulty, notwithstanding the extensive observation of high\r\nauthority. In the majority of cases the ring-finger is longer than the\r\nindex.\r\n\r\nImportant evidence is furnished from the existence of _injuries_ such\r\nas fractures, whether old or recent; the marks of gunshot wounds, of\r\ntrephining, amputation, excision, or other surgical operation on the\r\nbones. The remains of an old, ununited fracture in his left humerus\r\nenabled Sir William Fergusson to verify and settle all doubt as to\r\nthe identity of the body of the great missionary and explorer, Dr.\r\nLivingston.[579] The existence of an injury may constitute evidence of\r\ngreat importance to the accused, as happened in the case of an English\r\ngentleman charged with murder, where the trial turned on the deposit of\r\ncallus in a broken rib, the only bone produced in court. From the state\r\nof this callus there could be no doubt that the fracture must have\r\nbeen produced about eight or ten days before death, and could not have\r\nbelonged to the deceased. There was, therefore, complete failure of the\r\nidentity, and the accused was discharged.[580]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, circumstances may arise in which the existence or\r\nnot of an injury is a fact of great importance to the prosecution.\r\nAmong other specimens in the Army Medical Museum at Washington, the\r\nbones of the forearm of Wirtz, executed for inhuman treatment of\r\nprisoners during the Civil War, show no remains or trace of fracture;\r\nyet it was claimed in defence at the trial that he could not have been\r\nguilty of the atrocities attributed to him, for the reason that this\r\narm was disabled from a fracture.\r\n\r\n_Disease of the bones_, whether hereditary or acquired, is an\r\nessential descriptive element in reconstituting individuality.\r\nCaries and necrosis, rickets, spinal disease, ankylosis, and other\r\nexternal manifestations of bone lesion may furnish pointers of such\r\nvalue as often to be incontestible. They are so evident as not to\r\nrequire detailed mention; but much care in such cases is necessary to\r\ndistinguish between disease, decay, and violence, and artefacta. The\r\nlast may have resulted from the axe or spade of the grave-digger or\r\nfrom post-mortem lesions made at the necropsy, as in the remains of\r\nthe notorious Beau Hickman of Washington, whose body on being exhumed\r\nshowed that sundry amputations and reamputations had been made on the\r\nprincipal limbs. Having died in a public hospital, the cadaver had been\r\nutilized in rehearsal of these operations previous to its burial in the\r\nPotter’s Field.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the phalanges, known as “baseball fingers,” are valuable\r\nindications. This was one of the facts of identification in the\r\ncelebrated Cronin case.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF BURIAL.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the exhumed bones may throw some light on the question\r\nas to the probable length of time they have been under ground, as well\r\nas the probable cause of death. If the bones were entirely denuded of\r\nsoft parts we should hardly expect them to be those of a corpse buried\r\nonly three or four months previously. The noting of such an injury as\r\na fracture inflicted by some sharp instrument on a skull found in a\r\ncesspool was sufficient, with other evidence of a general character, to\r\nconvict a prisoner tried at the Derby Lent Assizes in 1847.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of the kind under consideration, special attention should\r\nbe paid to the surroundings, every little detail of which should be\r\nnoted with the utmost accuracy; for such articles as clothes, jewelry,\r\nbuttons, and in fact anything that may furnish an inference,[581] may\r\nnot only throw light on the identity of the person, but otherwise\r\nassist justice. Cases are recorded in which the identity has been\r\nestablished principally by the clothing found with the skeleton.\r\nIn Taylor’s “Medical Jurisprudence” a case is mentioned where the\r\nskeleton, portions of clothes, buttons, and boots of a Cornish miner\r\nwere identified after twenty-six years’ submersion in water. Somewhat\r\nsimilar circumstances, a few years ago, enabled the arctic explorer,\r\nLieutenant Schwatka, and others to identify the remains of Lieutenant\r\nIrving, of the ill-fated Franklin party.\r\n\r\nIn exceptional circumstances, as that of great cold, for instance,\r\norganic remains may be preserved indefinitely. Visitors to the Junior\r\nUnited Service Club in London may remember the mammoth bones discovered\r\nin digging the foundation of the club-house. Accounts of remarkable\r\npreservation of bodies discovered a long time after the occurrence of\r\nAlpine accidents, and the finding of well-preserved mammoth remains in\r\nthe Siberian ice, are matters of common knowledge. A few years since,\r\nin assisting to take the remains of a mammoth from an ice cliff in\r\nEscholtz Bay, Alaska, I came across the skull of a musk-ox and the\r\nrib of a reindeer which showed the deformity and callus of a united\r\nfracture, yet there are geological reasons for believing that thousands\r\nof years must have elapsed since these remains were entombed in the ice.\r\n\r\nA precaution to be taken in judicial investigation of bones is to\r\nascertain whether they belong to more than one body, as they may have\r\nbeen put together with a view to deceive. Each bone should be examined\r\nseparately, to ascertain whether it is a right or left bone or belongs\r\nto the same skeleton. They should be put together with intelligence\r\nand care, and if incomplete parts of a skeleton they may be laid in\r\nsand or putty and photographed, or the medical man may go further and,\r\nAgassiz-like, reconstruct the skeleton from the fragments. In the case\r\nof a fracture the bones should be sawn longitudinally in order to study\r\nthe callus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAIR AND NAILS.\r\n\r\nSince the hair and nails resist decomposition an unusually long\r\ntime, and are even believed to grow after somatic death, they may be\r\nconsidered as accessories of such value in the question that occupies\r\nus as to make it possible to verify certain characteristics regarding\r\nthe remains of the cadaver even after years of inhumation. For\r\ninstance, hypertrophy of the great toe-nail, the length and color of\r\nthe hair, baldness, or a long beard might furnish evidence of the best\r\nkind. Both hair and nails may, however, change after death. A case is\r\nmentioned[582] in which the hair changed from a dark brown to red after\r\ntwenty years of burial. Accredited cases of the growth of hair after\r\ndeath are also on record. Dr. Caldwell, of Iowa, states that he was\r\npresent in 1862 at the exhumation of a body which had been buried for\r\nfour years. He found that the coffin had given at the joints and that\r\nthe hair protruded through the openings. He had evidence to show that\r\nthe deceased was shaved before burial, nevertheless the hair of the\r\nhead measured eighteen inches, the whiskers eight inches, and the hair\r\nof the breast four to six inches.[583] Quite recently in unearthing the\r\nremains of an old cemetery in Washington, D. C., a number of persons\r\nnoticed that when the body of a young girl, supposed to be about twelve\r\nor thirteen years of age, was taken up it was found that her hair\r\nhad grown until it extended from her crown to her feet. Many careful\r\nobservations seem to prove the molecular life of the hair and nails\r\nafter somatic death. It suffices to quote the well-known case mentioned\r\nin Ogston’s “Medical Jurisprudence,” of several medical students who\r\nwere brought to trial for having in custody the dead body of an idiot\r\nboy. When found on the dissecting-table the body was so disfigured\r\nthat there was only one means left of proving its identity. The boy\r\nhad a whim during life of permitting his nails to grow, and had not\r\nallowed them to be cut for many years previous to his death. They had\r\ncompletely curled round the tips of his fingers and toes till they had\r\nthus come to extend along the palmar and plantar surfaces in a strange\r\nway. The counsel for the prosecution availed himself of the knowledge\r\nof this fact, and his proof seemed to be complete, when a medical\r\nman came forward and gave in evidence that it was not an unusual\r\ncircumstance for the nails to grow for several inches after death. This\r\nastounding statement so nonplussed the judge that the case was allowed\r\nto drop as not proven.\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases the hair may be _green_. I saw a case some years\r\nsince, for which no cause could be assigned, and only a few days ago\r\nI saw another in a man who worked in a brass-foundry. At the Cronin\r\ntrial a barber, who had counted the victim among his customers,\r\nrecognized the shape of the head and texture of the hair. Subsequent\r\nevidence of medical experts was conclusive as to the identity of hair\r\nfound clinging to a trunk, the hair cut from the head of the murdered\r\nman, and that of a single hair discovered on a cake of soap. This\r\nsingle strand, being lighter in color in some portions than in others,\r\nseemed to indicate that it could not have come from the head of the\r\ndeceased, whose hair was brown. But it was shown that hair placed on\r\nsoap or other alkaline substances becomes bleached in a manner similar\r\nto the color of a single thread. This evidence of vital importance\r\nlinked the hair found in the trunk with that cut from Dr. Cronin’s\r\nhead, and went far toward proving that one of the murderers had washed\r\nhis hands with the soap after the deed had been done.\r\n\r\nReviewing the signs furnished by the osseous system, it will be seen\r\nthat the study of the skeleton alone is beyond contradiction more\r\nsatisfactory and more important in establishing identity than that\r\nof all the other organs. Consequently a correct interpretation of\r\nthe facts observed and judicious application of the rules deducible\r\ntherefrom may in the matter of a human skeleton put its identity\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. But the expert should remember that as no\r\ntwo cases are just alike, unexpected questions and unforeseen features\r\nmay present themselves, giving to each case merits of its own. At best\r\nthe medical man’s conclusions will be probabilities, not certainties;\r\ntherefore his expressions of opinion should be the more guarded, as\r\nupon it may hang the life of an innocent man.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTIFICATION OF MUTILATED REMAINS.\r\n\r\nMany of the foregoing remarks on the identity of the skeleton apply\r\nin cases where mutilated remains or a portion only of the body has\r\nbeen recovered. Circumstances often occur in which bodies may require\r\nidentification after having been drowned and partly eaten by fishes\r\nor crabs, or after having been partly eaten by buzzards, or torn into\r\nfragments by animals, as has happened in the remains of a dead infant\r\npartly devoured by a dog, and in the case of a farmer who died in the\r\nwoods and was subsequently eaten by his own hogs. After accidents\r\nand fires where many persons perish; after a railway disaster where\r\nbodies have been mangled, drowned, burnt, and frozen, all in the same\r\naccident; or after an explosion from steam or gas or in a mine, or\r\nfrom gunpowder, dynamite, or other substance, the human remains are\r\ngenerally in such a state as to defy all attempts at recognition.\r\n\r\nTo dispose of a dead body in order to avoid detection, criminals will\r\nmutilate, disfigure, and chop into fragments the remains, which they\r\nafterward place in a trunk, a wardrobe, or throw into a sewer or other\r\nhiding-place. Scarcely a year passes that judiciary medicine is not\r\nconcerned with cases of the kind. The frequency of such crimes has been\r\nattributed by some to the so-called contagion of murder; others offer\r\nthe simple law of the series in explanation; others still believe that\r\nimitation is the principal cause. While there is no doubt a grain of\r\ntruth in each of these, less philosophic minds will look upon such a\r\nbeastly proceeding as a mark of the complete satisfaction sought by the\r\ndestructive instinct.\r\n\r\nWhy such things should be is of less concern than the fact that\r\ncriminal mutilation of the dead body is not confined to any age or\r\ncountry. Though more frequent in the last fifteen years, it takes up\r\nquite a space in the history of human cruelty. The violent passion,\r\nwrath, and vengeance that caused the prophet Isaiah to be sawn in two\r\nat the age of one hundred years by order of Manasses and Agag cut into\r\npieces by Samuel have not materially changed in the days of Jack the\r\nRipper; and we find such crimes in antipodal parts of the world, among\r\nvaried sociological conditions, no matter whether it be the North\r\nAmerican Indian, who scalps and mutilates his enemy and places the\r\nsevered penis in the mouth, or the civilized European, who cuts up the\r\nbody of his victim and serves it in a curry at a feast of assembled\r\nfriends.[584]\r\n\r\nThis new point of judiciary medicine has lately been elaborated by\r\nEuropean writers under the title of _Dépeçage Criminel_, a term which\r\napplies to the operation resorted to by an assassin having for its end\r\nthe getting rid of the body of the victim and to render more difficult\r\nthe establishment of its identity.\r\n\r\nThe cleverness of experts scarcely keeps pace nowadays with the more\r\ncomplicated proceedings adopted by criminals. In fact, at a trial of\r\nthis kind truth and science are often the under dogs in a fight, than\r\nwhich none in forensic medicine is longer and more embarrassing. To\r\ncause a rapid disappearance of the proofs of a homicide, with a view\r\nto escape the investigations of justice, murderers have been known\r\nliterally to make hash of the victim which was subsequently eaten by\r\nthemselves and others. Gruner relates the case of a man who, having\r\nkilled and cut into pieces his victim, boiled and roasted the fragments\r\nand ate them with his wife. Such examples, however, suggest morbid\r\nrather than passional phenomena, which manifestly call for rigid\r\nscrutiny into the mental state of the culprit, who may be more of a\r\nlunatic than a malefactor.\r\n\r\nIn cases of infanticide new-born children are sometimes cut into pieces\r\nand the fragments burnt in order to facilitate the disappearance of the\r\ncadaver. There does not appear to be, however, any well-authenticated\r\ninstance of the operation having been done on a living child. Generally\r\nthe dismemberment is done in order to cause more ready disappearance of\r\nthe remains.\r\n\r\nThe medico-legal problem to be solved in cases of criminal mutilation\r\nis to establish the identity of the victim and that of the author of\r\nthe crime.\r\n\r\nMany apparently trivial circumstances may assist in the formation of an\r\nopinion as to the identity of the culprit. If the victim be an adult,\r\na man is the author of the deed; if an infant, a woman, the mother, is\r\nalmost always the guilty one. The London _Lancet_ (May 30th, 1863, p.\r\n617) reports a case in which the body of a child, of apparently four to\r\nsix months, was found in the sewage of a water-closet, minus an arm cut\r\noff below the shoulder, presumably that a vaccination-mark might not be\r\nadduced as evidence. A young woman was suspected. Several women deposed\r\nhaving seen a dusky-brown mother’s mark near the child’s navel. After\r\nsteeping in pure water a portion of the skin said to include the mark,\r\nand after washing, the mark gradually reappeared at the end of three\r\ndays, perfectly distinct. It was recognized by witnesses and produced\r\nat the trial as corroborative evidence. The accused was found guilty.\r\n\r\nIn a case of infanticide at Tarare, in 1884, the upper extremity of a\r\nfœtus was found to have been disarticulated after the manner of carving\r\nthe wing of a fowl. This having suggested to Dr. Lacassagne a cook as\r\nthe author of the crime, she was speedily discovered and convicted. A\r\nfew years later an analogous case occurred in Florence and was reported\r\nby Dr. A. Montalti.\r\n\r\nThe instrument used for mutilating the body may furnish a suggestion\r\nof identity, to be dispelled or affirmed upon further investigation.\r\nThe mode of section observed in various instances has led to the\r\nrecognition of a butcher as the culprit. An expert would have but\r\nlittle trouble in distinguishing the hacking and mangling of a body\r\nfrom the careful cutting and preservation of muscles and blood-vessels\r\nin dissections made by medical students, whom the public, by the way,\r\ninvariably suspect in cases of mutilation. If it can be ascertained\r\nthat the instrument used was operated either by a left-handed person or\r\nby an ambidexter, such a fact may prove of importance. Sometimes the\r\nfragments are tied or sewn up in a package. The manner in which the\r\nknot is tied may indicate the occupation of the culprit. In one case\r\nthe regularity of the sewing revealed that it was the work of a woman.\r\nExamination of the remains of clothing and of neighboring objects where\r\nthe crime was committed may result in the identification of the victim\r\nor of the murderer. Indeed, it is the careful noting of trivial facts\r\nand their combination that is so valuable in all investigations of\r\nthis class. A compound fact made up of minor facts, which considered\r\nseverally would possess but little value, may sometimes solve the\r\npuzzle in a case where no single fact of conclusive value is obtainable.\r\n\r\nHaving collected as much of the mutilated remains as possible, the\r\nfirst step toward identification is to replace the pieces in anatomical\r\norder, to note carefully their correspondence or otherwise, and to\r\nascertain whether the fragments belong to the same body or to two or\r\nseveral individuals. This is often a delicate and difficult matter,\r\nespecially where decomposition is advanced or where the horror has been\r\npushed to its utmost limits, as in the case of a fratricide committed\r\nin France by several persons, who fragmented the cadaver with a saw and\r\nhatchet; boiled the remains and fed them to hogs; and, after crushing\r\nthe bones with a hammer, threw the fragments into a deep gorge.\r\nAgain, the body may be divided into numerous pieces, a hundred or\r\nmore, and disposed of in widely different localities, as in a pond, a\r\nmanure-heap, a river, or a cesspool. The chopped-up remains of infants\r\nhave been boiled in lye and afterward thrown into a privy or put in a\r\nbarrel of vinegar. A mother has also been known to cook with cabbage\r\nthe dismembered remains of her six-months’ child and serve it at a meal\r\nof which both she and her husband partook.\r\n\r\nNumerous counterparts of such cases happening in late years could\r\nbe cited where the object was to favor the disappearance of the\r\ncadaver, and in which the establishment of the identity turned on\r\nthe examination of some small part of the organism; the uterus, the\r\nspermatic cord, the lobe of the ear, the hair, or the teeth furnishing\r\na positive demonstration that led to judiciary results.\r\n\r\nPUTREFACTION goes on very fast in a corpse that has been mutilated; but\r\nit is slower in parts which, on being separated just after death, have\r\nbecome bloodless in consequence of the hemorrhage. After submersion\r\nthe outward signs of putrefaction put a notable obstacle in the\r\nway of identification, and after drowning the body becomes rapidly\r\nunrecognizable.\r\n\r\nSupposing it impossible to reconstitute the cadaver in all its\r\nessential parts, it is always possible, by following the instructions\r\nalready given for examining the skeleton, to infer from one or\r\nseveral parts of the cadaver the sex, age, height, and sometimes\r\npathological peculiarities of the victim. Examination of the skeleton\r\nand teeth is of capital importance in an investigation of this class.\r\nThe indications furnished thereby having already been touched upon,\r\nand being about all that we are justified in saying, it is only\r\nnecessary to repeat that many of the details relative to these special\r\nindications are so confusing as to suggest caution in using the\r\nstatistical tables of even high authority, as the observations they\r\nrest on are not of sufficient extent to deserve confidence.\r\n\r\nA survey of the head, limbs, trunk, and genital parts will give the\r\nmost useful indications. The HEAD, in fact, is the surest index\r\nfor justice, and one that lends promptness in the discovery of the\r\nassassin. Typical illustrations of this occur in the Goss-Udderzook\r\ncase and in the recent example of the bomb-thrower, Norcross. In the\r\ncase of a woman murdered by her husband at Antwerp in 1877 and cut\r\ninto one hundred and fifty-three pieces and her remains thrown into\r\na privy, the color of the hair, the lobule of a torn ear, and the\r\nuterus of a woman having had children furnished special signs that\r\nled to identity and condemnation. Examination of the _brain_ and its\r\nmembranes, though furnishing no very notable characteristics in the\r\nmatter of identification, may nevertheless be regarded as a natural\r\ncorollary to that of the skull. Brain weight, which is greatest\r\nbetween thirty and forty years, 1,200 to 1,450 grams in man, 1,100 to\r\n1,500 in woman, diminishes toward the sixtieth year. It is said that\r\nthe diminution takes place a few years sooner in the opposite sex.\r\nThe estimated loss of weight in a person of eighty years is admitted\r\nto be from 90 to 150 grams. Another sign of age is the tendency to\r\ndegeneration found in the pineal gland, the cortical substance, the\r\noptic and striate thalami, and in the brain capillaries.\r\n\r\nThe state of the eyes, if not too decomposed, may still become a sign\r\nof identity. For instance, the color of the iris, an arcus senilis,\r\na pterygium, a cataract or an operation for the same, an iridectomy,\r\netc., are signs that occasion may utilize.\r\n\r\nThe TRUNK may show, as it has in several instances, incised wounds\r\nthat caused death before the mutilation. Besides, the organs therein\r\ncontained may by their weight, dimension, and tissue alteration\r\nindicate the progress of age and of degeneration. Modifications of the\r\ncirculatory and respiratory apparatus are obviously characteristic. As\r\nage advances the only organ whose weight increases with the number of\r\nyears, the heart, may become hypertrophied or dilated; its coronary\r\narteries may undergo an alteration; the pericardium thickens, and in\r\nfact arterial atheroma and degeneration generally may begin between\r\nthirty-five and forty years. It should, however, be borne in mind that\r\nthese signs of senility may come much later or even not at all. In a\r\nman of eighty-four years Tourdes found no notable tissue lesion; in\r\nanother of one hundred and four Lobstein found no trace of ossification\r\nof the arteries of the trunk and upper extremities, and in Thomas\r\nParr, aged one hundred and fifty-two years, Harvey found absolutely no\r\nlesion of this kind. Although toward eighty years the heart increases\r\nin weight in both sexes, the opposite has been observed in exceptional\r\ncases. Placing the average weight of this organ in the adult at 266\r\ngrams for men, 220 for women, it will be found that progress in weight\r\ngives toward the eightieth year an increase of 90 grams for men and\r\n60 for women. Yet a case of cardiac atrophy is reported in a woman of\r\neighty whose heart weighed but 170 grams.\r\n\r\nDiminished weight of the lungs becomes accentuated with years.\r\nEspecially is this the case after pseudo-melanosis and senile\r\nemphysema. The state of the lungs of stone-cutters and miners and\r\nvarious thoracic and abdominal diseases may likewise become signs of\r\nidentity. A cirrhosed liver, an enlarged spleen, a senile kidney, and\r\nthe like, are sufficiently obvious in their bearings on this question.\r\n\r\nLike the trunk, the ARMS AND LEGS, in cases of the class under\r\nconsideration, show but few traces of disfigurement other than the\r\nfact of their having been disjointed. The manner in which the sections\r\nwere made and the proceedings employed for the disarticulation would\r\nequally affirm an experienced hand or the reverse. Such facts have of\r\nlate years assisted in the discovery and condemnation both of a farmer\r\nand of a medical student, and also in the case of the cook already\r\nmentioned, who cut off her child’s arm after the manner of carving the\r\nwing of a fowl. The existence of deformity, injury, and disease in the\r\nlimbs should, of course, claim attention, but their relativity in an\r\ninvestigation of the kind is too apparent to require further comment.\r\n\r\nMutilation of the GENITAL ORGANS is not so common. Persons familiar\r\nwith border warfare have observed the savage custom of cutting off\r\nthe victim’s penis and placing it in his mouth. In more civilized\r\ncommunities the culprits are generally women in whom hatred and\r\nferocity prompt an act that marks the evident satisfaction sought by\r\nthe destructive instinct. Sometimes, however, the genital organs have\r\nbeen cut from the cadaver of a woman, presumably for the purpose of\r\nconcealing traces of rape that may have preceded the murder. The signs\r\nfurnished by the female genital organs as to virginity, maternity,\r\nand the menopause are so easily demonstrated at the necropsy as to\r\nbecome positive proofs of identity. The uterus loses both in size\r\nand weight with age. This along with hard, atrophied, and germless\r\novaries attests the stoppage of menstruation. The question of identity\r\nmay turn on the age at which menstruation ceases, as happened in an\r\naction of ejectment in the case of Doe on the demise of Clark _vs._\r\nTatom. The period known as change of life, when the uterus and ovaries\r\nlose their function, though placed at forty-five and fifty years, is\r\nquite uncertain. In spite of _averages_, menstruation is occasionally\r\ncontinued to seventy and upward.[585]\r\n\r\nThe signs furnished by the genital organs of the male are of less\r\nimportance. Atrophy and diminished weight of the testicles and rarity\r\nor absence of the spermatozoids are indications of senility; although\r\nspermatozoids have been observed at ninety-four years. The structure\r\nof the spermatic cord at different periods of life from the last\r\nof intra-uterine to the first of extra-uterine life, in puberty,\r\nand in old age, is accompanied by characteristic modifications of\r\ndevelopment and regression, which are of interest on the question of\r\nmedico-forensic diagnosis of identity, as shown by Dr. Pellacani.[586]\r\n\r\nCongenital deformity of the genital parts, as epispadias or\r\nhypospadias; marks of circumcision, useful in India to identify\r\nMussulmans above eleven years; traces of disease that may have left\r\nextensive cicatrices, as phagadenic chancre, suppurating buboes, etc.,\r\nmay also furnish characteristics of evidential value.\r\n\r\n\r\nENTIRE CADAVER DEAD BUT A SHORT TIME.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a body that has been dead a short time only, recognition\r\nfrom the features, even by the nearest relatives, is often a matter\r\nof the greatest difficulty. The change produced in the color and form\r\nof the body, especially after drowning, is a formidable obstacle to\r\nidentification by likeness and general type of face. Pages could be\r\nfilled with the mere mention of the multiplied instances of mistaken\r\nidentity of the living, many of whom have been punished because they\r\nhad the misfortune to resemble some one else. How much more careful,\r\nthen, should be the medical examination of the remains in the progress\r\nof decay, with the distortion and discoloration of the features, and\r\nthe consequent change or destruction of the peculiar expression of\r\nthe countenance by which human features are usually distinguished and\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\nAmong the innumerable instances of mistaken personal identity and cases\r\nof resemblance mentioned in history and fable, from the time of Ulysses\r\ndown to the days of Rip Van Winkle’s dog Schneider, it appears that\r\nthis animal is credited with more sagacity than man in the matter of\r\nrecognizing his master even after years of absence. Indeed, recognition\r\nby animals may be considered a proof of identity. Many persons can\r\nrecall instances of the kind, though perhaps not so dramatic as the one\r\nof the dog in the Odyssey, who recognized his master after twenty years\r\nof absence and died immediately thereafter.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, time and circumstances will so alter resemblance\r\nas to account for some of these most striking proofs of the fallibility\r\nof human testimony that we see illustrated in chapters on mistaken\r\nidentity. We easily forget the true image of persons and things,\r\nand time promptly modifies them. The evidence of the senses may be\r\nso little trusted in this regard that father, mother, husband, and\r\nnurse may attest a false identity in the case of their own children.\r\nA nurse has been known to testify to the identity of the severed head\r\nof a woman whom thirteen other persons were sure they recognized from\r\ncharacteristic signs, when the supposed victim put in an appearance and\r\nthus attested her own existence. The head of the unrecognized victim of\r\nthis strange controversy is preserved in the museum of the Strassburg\r\nFaculty.\r\n\r\nIn another case of historical notoriety in France, forty witnesses on\r\neach side swore to the personality; while in the celebrated Tichbourne\r\ntrial no less than eighty-five witnesses maintained positively, under\r\nthe most rigid and scrutinizing cross-examination, that a certain\r\nperson was Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichbourne, a baronet; at the same\r\ntime a corresponding number were equally unshaken in their conviction\r\nthat he was a Wapping butcher, Arthur Orton.\r\n\r\nResemblances often bring about remarkable coincidences. A case is said\r\nto have occurred in Covington, Ky., where two men met, each the double\r\nof the other in form, stature, and feature, each having lost a right\r\nleg, amputated at the knee, and each being blind in the left eye from\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nPuzzle and perplexity are not confined to remarkable cases and judicial\r\nerrors; for so many people are unskilled in correct observation that\r\nit is a matter of common occurrence for two individuals to be mistaken\r\nthe one for the other. The writer for some years has frequently been\r\nmistaken for a certain naval officer he is said to resemble, while the\r\nofficer in question has become so accustomed to being called “Doctor”\r\nthat he answers to the title without protest.\r\n\r\nA case that has of late been much quoted in the journals is that of\r\nTiggs. What was supposed to be his mangled body was identified by\r\nhis wife, and further identification was forthcoming from one of his\r\nchildren and the employer of the deceased. The coroner had granted\r\na certificate for burial, and as the hearse neared the door, to the\r\nsurprise of all parties the real Tiggs entered the house and gave a\r\nsatisfactory account of his absence.\r\n\r\nMost mistakes of this kind are the result of existing imperfections\r\nin the average human mind or in its use. So few people are skilled in\r\nminute observation that Lord Mansfield’s dictum regarding the “likeness\r\nas an argument of a child being the son of a parent” should be received\r\nwith a certain degree of reserve, especially in the question of\r\nidentity from likeness after death. In Ogston’s “Medical Jurisprudence”\r\na case is related of a father who could not recognize the body of his\r\nson drowned at sea ten days previously. The mother, however, identified\r\nher boy from the existence of two pimple-looking projections on the\r\nfront of the chest, which proved to be supplementary mammæ.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the changes in the face and countenance two weeks after\r\ndeath are such that it is well-nigh impossible to establish identity\r\nfrom the features alone. Yet in exceptional cases the external results\r\nof putrefactive decomposition have been so delayed or modified as\r\nto produce very small changes in the features even after many years\r\nof burial. Bodies have been known to retain a remarkable state of\r\npreservation for long periods in such circumstances as burial in a\r\npeat bog, in the sand of the desert, and in the frozen ground of cold\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nEven _photography_ in the matter of identity is not to be trusted.\r\nThough an important accessory to other evidence, it is often, and very\r\nproperly, objected to by lawyers on the ground of being incompetent,\r\nirrelevant, and immaterial. The picture presented for comparison may\r\nnot be an original one or it may have been taken years previously. The\r\ndifficulty in recognizing one’s own most intimate friends from pictures\r\ntaken only a few years back is a matter of common knowledge. Besides,\r\nthe negative from which the picture was taken may have been retouched\r\nor altered, consequently it would not be the same as produced by the\r\ncamera, and is, therefore, valueless as evidence. It is held to be\r\nincompetent to prove a photograph by merely asking a witness whether or\r\nnot he recognizes the picture in question as that of a certain person.\r\n\r\nIn all cases where photographic pictures are required in a court of\r\nlaw the authorities are that the artist who took the picture must be\r\nproduced and show that he took the picture, and that it is a correct\r\nrepresentation of the original of which it claims to be a picture. If\r\npossible the negatives themselves should be called for and reproduced.\r\nDr. Tidy states that he has known a volume of smoke appear in a print\r\nas issuing from a chimney, and used as evidence of the existence of a\r\nnuisance, when no smoke existed in the original negative. Only slight\r\nfamiliarity with the method of taking photographic pictures and the\r\nchemistry involved in the process suffices to show that many little\r\ndetails of sensitizing, exposing, developing, and printing greatly\r\nchange the general appearance of the face. Some of the tricks that may\r\nbe played with photography, illustrating its comparative incompetency\r\nas evidence in the matter of personal identification, I have seen in a\r\nseries of pictures at the Department of Justice in Washington. All were\r\nphotographs of the same person taken in such varying circumstances that\r\nno two are alike or recognizable as the same person, until scrutiny\r\nis brought to bear on the profile of the nose.[587] In considering\r\nphotography in its bearing on this branch of medicine, it must also be\r\nborne in mind that a certain degree of imperfection arises from want\r\nof uniformity in the lenses of cameras. I have already mentioned the\r\nwant of precision in photographing the skull, the common defect being\r\ncentral not orthogonal projection such as anthropometry requires.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURFACE SIGNS OF IDENTITY.\r\n\r\nExamination of the surface of the skin and of its appendages may in\r\ncertain cases take decisive importance. Valuable medical proof is often\r\nfurnished by scars, nævi, growths on the skin, pock-marks, traces of\r\nskin disease or of scrofula, and by the so-called professional stigmata\r\nwhich would suggest the trade, character of work, or occupation of\r\nthe deceased. Thus cigarette-stains on the fingers of smokers, or\r\nsilver-stains on the hands of photographers, the horny palm of the\r\nlaborer, or the soft, delicate hand of one not accustomed to work,\r\nwould be indicative. The alterations in the hand make it, so to\r\nspeak, the seat of election; for in the majority of trades that may\r\nbe mentioned it is the hand alone that bears the principal marks of\r\ndaily work that indicate the calling. A case is recorded of a person\r\nwho previously to his assassination was lame and walked with a crutch.\r\nAlthough the body was cut into fragments, an examination revealed in\r\nthe palm of the hands characteristic callosities, showing prolonged use\r\nof support of this kind. In another instance of criminal mutilation a\r\ntattoo-mark found on the arm proved an overwhelming charge against the\r\nassassin and drew forth his confession. An accused was also convicted\r\nof murder after establishing the only missing link, the question of\r\nidentity, which turned on the finding of cupping-marks and a tattoo\r\non the body of the murdered man. Personal identity of the bodies of\r\ninfants has, moreover, been proved by means of a small blister; by a\r\npatch of downy hair; by the similarity existing between two pieces\r\nof thread used to tie the umbilical cord; and by the severed end of\r\nthat part of the funis attached to the infant fitting precisely to the\r\ncorresponding portion attached to the after-birth. In addition to these\r\na methodical examination may put in evidence other facts that may be\r\nderived from diverse influences that leave characteristic traces.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS FURNISHED BY MARKS, SCARS, STAINS, ETC., ON THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nBut of all the surface signs, whether congenital or acquired, that\r\nmay throw light on the antecedents of the decedent, birth-marks,\r\nfreckles, cicatrices, tattooes, and the professional signs furnish the\r\nbest indications. Birth-marks (_nævi materni_), from their supposed\r\nindelibility, have given rise to discussion at many celebrated\r\ntrials. As a rule, these marks are permanent and seldom lose their\r\ndistinctness, though in exceptional cases they may undergo atrophy\r\nin the first years of life. Hence testimony as to the existence of\r\nbirth-marks may often be uncertain when it has reference to a period a\r\nlong way back. In a recorded case of supposed recognition of a person\r\nhaving a mark of this kind on her face, the alleged victim turned up\r\nand established her identity as well as the fact that she did not have\r\nthe birth-mark attributed to her.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of the electrolytic method it was customary\r\nto resort to cauterization, excision, vaccination, and tattooing the\r\npigmentary spot in order to modify or remove these congenital marks.\r\nSuch proceedings usually left more or less of an indelible scar which\r\noccasion might utilize in the matter of medico-legal diagnosis. The\r\ntraces of nævi may, however, be entirely removed by electrolysis. I\r\nhave recently seen a nævus of large dimension on the face of a young\r\nwoman so completely destroyed as to leave no trace of the operation.\r\n\r\nThe _possibility of the disappearance of a scar_ in such circumstances\r\ndepends here, as it does in other instances, on the depth of the wound.\r\nA cicatrix being the result of a solution of continuity in the derma,\r\nthe question arises whether a wound that has divided the derma without\r\nloss of substance and healed by first intention leaves any perceptible\r\nscar. Some are of the opinion that a cicatricial line persists, but\r\ngrows fainter with time. Histological examination in a question of\r\nthis kind might prove conclusive by showing the structure of the\r\nfibrocellular tissue that constitutes the cicatrix. In the case of very\r\nsuperficial burns or wounds, the scar may completely disappear if the\r\nepidermis alone or the superficial part of the derma is attacked; on\r\nthe other hand, if there has been long suppuration or loss of substance\r\nfrom ulcers, chancres, or buboes, especially on the neck, groins,\r\nlegs, or genital parts, traces of their lesion will be found. It may,\r\ntherefore, be asserted as a general rule that all scars resulting from\r\nwounds and from skin diseases which involve any loss of substance are\r\n_indelible_. A scar on the face is one of the points at issue in the\r\ncelebrated Hillmon case already mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs the matter of cicatrices is treated in the section on WOUNDS,\r\nfurther mention here would be superfluous.\r\n\r\n\r\nTATTOOING.\r\n\r\nOf all the scars that speak, none in judiciary medicine affords better\r\nsigns of identity by their permanency and durable character and the\r\ndifficulty of causing their disappearance than those furnished by\r\ntattoo-marks.\r\n\r\nThe custom of tattooing having existed from the earliest historical\r\nepochs is of interest not only from an ethnological but from a medical\r\nand pathological point of view, while it is of great importance in\r\nits relation to medical jurisprudence in cases of contested personal\r\nidentification which may be either established or refuted by this\r\nsign. So trustworthy is it in many instances as to become a veritable\r\nideograph that may indicate the personal antecedents, vocation, social\r\nstate, certain events of one’s life, and even their date.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the history of a subject mentioned by Hippocrates,\r\nPlato, Cæsar, and Cicero, it may be pertinent to say that tattooing is\r\nprohibited by the Bible (Leviticus xix., 28) and is condemned by the\r\nFathers of the Church, Tertullian among others, who gives the following\r\nrather singular reason for interdicting its use among women: “_Certum\r\nsumus Spiritum Sanctum magis masculis tale aliquid subscribere potuisse\r\nsi feminis subscripsisset._” (_De Virginibus_ velandis. Lutetiæ\r\nParisorum, 1675, fº, p. 178.)\r\n\r\nIn addition to much that has been written by French, German,[588] and\r\nItalian authors, who have put tattooing in an important place in legal\r\nmedicine, the matter of tattoo-marks a few years since claimed the\r\nattention of the law courts of England, the Chief Justice, Cockburn, in\r\nthe Tichbourne case, having described this species of evidence as of\r\n“vital importance,” and in itself final and conclusive. This celebrated\r\ntrial has brought to light about all the knowledge that can be used in\r\nthe investigation of this sign as a mark of identity. Absence of the\r\ntattoo-marks in this case justified the jury in their finding that the\r\ndefendant was not and could not be Roger Tichbourne, whereupon the\r\nalleged claimant was proved to be an impostor, found guilty of perjury,\r\nand sentenced to penal servitude.[589]\r\n\r\nThe practice of tattooing is found pretty much over the world, notably\r\nin the Polynesian Islands and in some parts of Japan. It is, however,\r\nnot found in Russia, being contrary to the superstitions of the people,\r\nwho regard a mark of this kind as an alliance or contract with evil\r\nspirits. Its use appears to be penal only, and is limited to Siberian\r\nconvicts. The degrading habit, confined to a low order of development,\r\nexists at the present time as a survival of a superstitious practice of\r\npaganism, probably owing to perversion of the sexual instinct, and is\r\nstill common among school-boys, sailors, soldiers, criminals, and the\r\nlowest order of prostitutes living in so-called civilized communities.\r\nIndeed, unanimity of opinion among medical and anthropological writers\r\nassigns erotic passion as the most frequent cause of tattooing, and\r\nshows the constant connection between tattoo-marks and crime. Penal\r\nstatistics show the greater number of tattooed criminals among the\r\nlowest order, as those who have committed crimes against the person;\r\nwhile the fewest are found among swindlers and forgers, the most\r\nintelligent class of criminals. Even amid intellectual advancement\r\nand æsthetic sensibility far in advance of the primitive man, such as\r\nexists in London and New York, for instance, are to be found persons\r\nwho make good incomes by catering to this depraved taste for savage\r\nornamentation. Persons who have been to Jerusalem may remember the\r\ntattooers, who try to induce travellers to have a cross tattooed on the\r\narm as a souvenir of the pilgrimage. If a writer in the _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_, 15th June, 1881, is to be believed, it appears that the Prince\r\nof Wales on his journey to the Holy Land had a Jerusalem Cross tattooed\r\non his arm, April 2d, 1862. The “Cruise of the _Bacchante_” also tells\r\nhow the Duke of York was tattooed while in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe process is now rapidly done, an Edison electric pen being utilized\r\nfor the purpose, and some of the wretched martyrs have the hardihood\r\nto be tattooed from head to foot with grotesque designs in several\r\ncolors. I know of several instances: one of a man in Providence, R.\r\nI.; another of a Portuguese barber, who has striped poles, razors,\r\nbrushes, and other emblems of his calling over the entire body. Another\r\nman has likenesses of Abe Lincoln and of Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany on\r\nhis respective shins. A Nova Scotian, tattooed from head to foot, has\r\namong other designs that of “St. George and the Dragon” on his back;\r\nwhile a Texas ranchman, six feet two inches tall, underwent the torture\r\nof eight weeks’ profanation of his body in order to appear in blue,\r\nbrown, and red, with an irreverent image on his back of the Immaculate\r\nConception and thirty-one angels.[590]\r\n\r\nA singular mixture of erotic and religious emblems is often found among\r\nthe varied and fantastic signs used in tattooing. I recall the case\r\nof a man who had represented on his back a fox-hunt, in which riders\r\nfollowed the hounds in full pursuit of a fox about to take cover in\r\nthe anus. In another case of a man accused of criminal attempt on two\r\nlittle girls, examination of the sexual organs revealed a tattoo on the\r\nback of the penis representing the devil with horns and red cheeks and\r\nlips. When the little girls were asked if the accused had shown them\r\nhis virile member, they answered, “This man unbuttoned himself and said\r\nto us: ‘I am going to make you see the devil.’” In the face of such\r\naffirmations, the accused confessed his crime and was condemned. Other\r\ntattoo signs of the grossest emblems of unnatural passion have been\r\nfound among low prostitutes, pederasts, and tribades.\r\n\r\nStatistics founded on numerous facts show many cases of tattooing\r\nof the penis and even of the labia majora in the lowest order of\r\nprostitutes, but these unclean images and revelations of lustful\r\ninstinct do not occur in the same order of frequency as those noted\r\non the forearm, the deltoid, or the inferior extremities. So valuable\r\nare these marks in their bearing on the class, vocation, character,\r\nand tastes of a person that the finding of anchors and ships would\r\nindicate a sailor; while flags, sabres, cannon, and other warlike signs\r\nwould indicate a soldier, etc. It is also noticeable that in the\r\ntattooing practised by lunatics the image relates in some way to the\r\nnature of the peculiar form of mental disease from which they suffer,\r\nand it is chiefly among the more severe and incurable cases of mental\r\ndegeneration that these signs are found. (See Dr. Riva’s article, “Il\r\ntatuaggio nel Manicomio d’Ancona,” _Cronica del Manicomio d’Ancona_,\r\nNovember, 1888.)\r\n\r\nAlmost always the motive that prompts these disfigurements of the\r\nskin is the result of impulse, of thoughtlessness, or of orgy, and\r\nalmost all the tattooed come to repent of their folly. The subject\r\nof _détatouage_ has of late taken a polemic turn in some of the\r\nContinental journals. There are besides many cases on record of\r\nsevere accidents and complications following the operation, such as\r\nsevere inflammation, erysipelas, abscess, and gangrene. Dr. Beuchon\r\ngives statistics of forty-seven cases, in which four were followed\r\nby mutilation and eight by death either directly or in consequence\r\nof an amputation. A certain proportion of what is known as _syphilis\r\ninsontium_ is to be found among the reported statistics of tattooing.\r\nDr. Bispham, of Philadelphia, informs me that while at Blockley\r\nHospital he saw thirty cases of syphilis that had been communicated by\r\nthe same tattooer.\r\n\r\nTattooing may sometimes be _accidental_. I have seen a departmental\r\nclerk with an elongated tattoo on the back of his hand caused by\r\naccidental wounding with an inked pen. A bursting shell during a\r\nnaval engagement has caused a characteristic tattoo on the face of a\r\nwell-known officer to be seen any day in Washington. Two cases of the\r\nbluish-black discoloration of the skin from taking nitrate of silver\r\nhave also come under my observation. Both occurred in medical men,\r\none of whom lives in Florida, the other in the District of Columbia.\r\nSilver discolorations of this kind are indelible, but I learn from\r\none of these gentlemen that large doses of iodide of potassium cause\r\ntemporary fading of the discoloration, which returns on stopping the\r\nmedicine.[591]\r\n\r\nThe _indelibility of tattoo-marks_ is such that their traces may be\r\neasily recognized in the cadaver, though in a somewhat advanced\r\nstage of putrefaction. They have even been recognized on a gangrenous\r\nlimb. Sometimes, however, it is impossible to recognize at first\r\nsight whether there has or has not been a tattoo. A strong light and\r\na magnifying glass and a microscopic examination of the neighboring\r\nganglia to detect the presence of coloring matter may assist in\r\nremoving doubt. It has been found on the bodies of tattooed cadavers\r\nthat the ganglia are filled with grains of coloring matter of the\r\nsame nature as that employed in making the tattoo. Attempts to remove\r\ntattoo-marks generally leave a vicious scar that is equally indelible.\r\nAn efficacious method is to tattoo the mark with a solution of\r\ntannin, which is followed by brushing over with nitrate of silver.\r\nA red cicatrix follows, and when the epidermis separates the tattoo\r\ndisappears. A better method, however, is by means of the electric\r\nneedle already mentioned in speaking of the electrolysis of nævi.\r\n\r\nThat _a tattoo-mark may disappear_ by the effects of time and leave no\r\ntrace is a matter that Cooper reports after examining the mutilated\r\nremains of a cadaver, and the statistics of Caspar, Tardieu, and\r\nHutin place it as high as nine in the hundred. An officer of the\r\nUnited States Revenue Marine lately called my attention to several\r\nsuperficial tattooes on the back of his hand which had disappeared. The\r\ndeeper ones, however, remained. The _spontaneous disappearance of a\r\ntattoo_ seems to be possible when the operation has been done in such\r\na superficial way as not to have passed the rete Malpighii, or when\r\nthe tattooing has been done with some substance not very tenacious,\r\nas vermilion, which appears to be easily eliminated. But when the\r\nparticles of coloring matter penetrate into the fibro-elastic tissue of\r\nthe derma, the disappearance of the tattoo is rare.\r\n\r\nIn seventy-eight individuals tattooed with vermilion alone, Hutin\r\nfound eleven upon whom the tattoo had disappeared. Out of one hundred\r\nand four tattooes made with a single color, India-ink, writing ink,\r\nblue or back, not a single one had completely disappeared. The results\r\nare identical if the tattooes are made with two colors. Thus in 153\r\ntattooes with vermilion and India-ink, one instance showed a fading of\r\nthe black, in another it had completely disappeared, the red being well\r\nmarked; twenty times the red was partly effaced, the black being well\r\nmarked; and in sixteen cases the red had completely disappeared, the\r\nblack remaining visible.[592]\r\n\r\nA tattoo-mark may sometimes be altered, in which case it proves\r\ndeceptive as an index. A workman changing his trade seeks to transform\r\nthe insignia of his first calling into those of the second, or a\r\ncriminal in order to avoid identity will make a change. In the former\r\ninstance the transformation is not difficult to detect, but in the\r\nlatter so much care is required to recognize the change that penal\r\nscience has relegated the sign to a secondary place.\r\n\r\nAs to the length of time since a tattoo-mark has been executed,\r\nauthorities are that it is impossible to tell after two or three weeks.\r\nWhether a tattoo-mark is real or feigned is easily settled by simply\r\nwashing the part. This question, as well as that of the judicial\r\nconsequences of such marks, is hardly pertinent to the matter in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF PROFESSIONAL STIGMATA.\r\n\r\nThe so-called professional signs are of undoubted value in the surface\r\nexamination for establishing identity, but it does not seem that\r\ntheir importance warrants the extreme prolixity given to them by some\r\nContinental writers, and even by one in the city of Mexico, Dr. Jose\r\nRamos.[593] For instance, it is pretended that cataract is more common\r\namong jewellers because of the fineness of their work; yet out of 952\r\ncataracts, of which a record has been kept, only two cases occurred in\r\njewellers. Besides, there is not one special sign or physical trace\r\nleft on the body by which a prostitute may be known, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that in life the collective appearance would seldom deceive an\r\nexperienced man.\r\n\r\nOnly in the case of sodomy, where anal coitus has been frequent, would\r\ncharacteristic signs be found. On anal examination of 446 prostitutes,\r\nDr. Coutagne[594] found the signs of post-perineal coitus in 180.\r\nHe cites the case of a young prostitute presenting the astonishing\r\ncontrast of a gaping anus surrounded by characteristic rhagades, with\r\nthe genital parts of an extreme freshness, a very narrow vagina, and\r\nnon-retracted hymen, constituting by their reunion a still firm ring.\r\nA fact yet more curious is shown by a specimen in the collection of\r\nthe museum of the laboratory of legal medicine at Lyons. The genital\r\norgans of the cadaver of a woman of twenty-eight or thirty years showed\r\na hymen intact and firm, but on examining the anal region it was\r\nsurprising to find an infundibuliform deformity with all the signs of\r\nsodomitical habits, which of course rectified the opinion that had been\r\nmade regarding the chastity of this woman.\r\n\r\nMany of the signs enumerated as peculiar to different callings have\r\nno special anatomical characteristic that is easy to distinguish with\r\nprecision, consequently they do not present a degree of certainty or\r\nconstancy sufficient to be invoked as strong medico-legal proof of\r\nidentity. Moreover, the effects of time or treatment may have caused\r\nalteration or disappearance of many of the signs in question, which\r\nwould at best be of negative rather than of absolute value.\r\n\r\nTo arrive at an impartial appreciation of the relative value of the\r\nprofessional stigmata as signs of identity, a certain number of the\r\nsigns should be thrown aside as illusory. Others, on the contrary, are\r\ndurable, special, and constant, and assist in establishing the identity\r\naccordingly as the lesions or alterations are complete or evident; but\r\nit should be borne in mind that the physical alterations and chemical\r\nmodifications resulting from the exercise of certain trades are not in\r\nour country so important from a medico-legal point of view as they are\r\nin Europe, where class distinctions are more defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF STAINS AND DIFFERENT IMPRINTS.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner that a very small portion or fragment of the human\r\nbody may suffice to establish the _corpus delicti_, so will minute\r\nremains or traces, as finger-marks, footprints, and other material\r\nsurroundings, even smells or traces of perfume, be of great assistance\r\nto justice in determining the identity of both culprit and victim, and\r\nat the same time throw light on the attendant circumstances of the\r\ndeed. The traces of a bloody hand or foot, smears of tar or paint,\r\nthe various spots or stains found on fabrics, instruments, etc., may\r\ninvolve questions of great nicety the relativity of which is apparent,\r\nespecially in criminal trials. Newspapers have familiarized the public\r\nwith many cases of the kind, in which medical experts have demonstrated\r\nblood and other stains with sufficient accuracy and positiveness to\r\nsatisfy a jury. The Cronin case is a notable instance.\r\n\r\nIMPRINTS MADE BY FINGER-TIPS are known to be singularly persistent.\r\nIn four specimens of inked digit marks of Sir William Herschel, made\r\nin the years 1860, 1874, 1885, and 1888 respectively, though there\r\nwas a difference of twenty-eight years between the first and last, no\r\ndifference could be perceived between the impressions. The forms of\r\nthe spirals remained the same, not only in general character, but in\r\nminute and measurable details, as in the distances from the centre\r\nof the spiral and in the direction at which each new ridge took its\r\nrise. Sir William Herschel has made great use of digit-marks for\r\nthe purposes of legal attestation among natives of India.[595] The\r\nextraordinary persistence of the papillary ridges on the inner surface\r\nof the hands throughout life has been a theme of discussion by the\r\nRoyal Society,[596] and Mr. Galton has devised a method of indexing\r\nfinger-marks.[597]\r\n\r\nThe IMPRESS OF A NAKED FOOT covered with blood may serve to direct the\r\ninvestigations of justice. In a criminal affair in France, where eight\r\nindividuals were implicated, comparative experiments upon the identity\r\nof the foot, made with a view to determine to which of the individuals\r\nought to be attributed the bloody footprints found near a wardrobe,\r\nit was shown that a degree of recognition could be established on\r\nreproducing the footprints with defibrinated blood. From the eight\r\nimprints of the left foot of each individual, impregnated with blood,\r\nmeasures and comparisons could be made, thus helping to establish the\r\ndifference or the resemblance with those found near the wardrobe.\r\n\r\nImprints thus obtained may be looked upon as a kind of documentary\r\nevidence, but too much importance should not be attached to them as\r\narticles tending to prove criminality. The futility of such evidence\r\nis shown in the varying sizes of different impressions of the foot of\r\nthe same person—first in rapid progression, secondly by standing,\r\nand third by slow advance. The results appear less sure in the case of\r\nfootprints made in mud, sand, dust, or snow. Nevertheless many facts\r\nrelating thereto may be noted with great certainty. The question has\r\nbeen mooted as to whether or not the impress left upon the soil gives\r\nalways the exact dimensions of the foot that has made them. One side\r\nhas contended that the footprints _are a little smaller_, while the\r\nother refutes this opinion and thinks that they are _a little larger_.\r\nThe consistency of the soil, which does not seem to have entered into\r\nthe discussion, doubtless accounts for the small differences that have\r\ngiven rise to this discrepancy of opinion. The outline of the sole of\r\nthe foot and the relative position of the toes are more or less neatly\r\ndesigned as the ground is more or less wet or soft. The means employed\r\nfor taking impressions of foot or other tracks in mud, etc., show\r\nconsiderable ingenuity on the part of those who have elaborated the\r\nsubject. To discover foot-marks in mud, powdered stearic acid is spread\r\nover the imprint and a heat of at least 212° is applied from above. By\r\nthis means a solid mould may be taken of the imprint. These researches\r\nhave been extended to the exact reproduction of imprints left upon snow\r\nby pouring melted gelatine upon the imprint previously sprinkled with a\r\nlittle common table salt, which rapidly lowers the temperature of the\r\nsnow about fifteen degrees and permits the mould to be taken without\r\ntoo much hurry. The study has been extended to the configuration of the\r\nplantar imprints in tabetics, but it does not appear so far to be of\r\nmuch medico-legal value.\r\n\r\nThe question may arise as to the length of time since the imprints\r\nwere made. This would, of course, depend upon many circumstances, as\r\nweather, temperature, and the like. It is a fact that in Greenland\r\nfootsteps in snow have been recognized many months after they were\r\nmade. A few summers ago, on an arctic expedition, I climbed Cape\r\nLisbourne, Alaska, in company with another person. The ground being\r\nthawed in many places, our feet left very decided imprints in the mud.\r\nA year afterward I visited the same spot, and on again making the\r\nascent was astonished to recognize the footsteps made the year before.\r\n\r\nCircumstances sometimes direct expert attention to vestiges of other\r\nanimals. The tracks of a dog or of a horse may become the object of a\r\nmedico-legal inquest. The books record a case in which it was necessary\r\nto ascertain whether a bite had been made by a large or a small dog.\r\nThis question was settled by producing the dogs and comparing their\r\nteeth with the scars. Persons familiar with border life know the\r\nimportance of trails and the minute observation that is brought to bear\r\non them by the experienced frontiersman. In following cattle-thieves\r\nand murderers, while with the Fourth United States Cavalry on the Rio\r\nGrande frontier, I have known the peculiarity of a horse’s footprint in\r\nthe prairie to tell a tale of great significance.\r\n\r\nObservation in this respect may extend to such apparently trivial\r\nobjects as the tracks of wheels, as those of a wagon, a wheelbarrow,\r\nor a bicycle, or to the singular imprints left by crutches or a\r\nwalking-stick. The imprint left in the ground by a cane usually occurs\r\nin the remarkable order of every two and a half or every four and a\r\nhalf steps. Investigation of such circumstances may result in material\r\nfacts that may be of great assistance in establishing the relation of\r\none or several persons with some particular act.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFORMITIES AND PATHOLOGICAL PECULIARITIES.\r\n\r\nThe existence of deformities or injuries is so apparent in serving to\r\nestablish identity that it seems almost superfluous to mention them,\r\nexcept for the purpose of deciding whether the wounds were made during\r\nlife or after death. In the matter of gunshot wounds on persons who\r\ntook part in the late Civil War, many of whom unfortunately belong to\r\nthe vagrant class and are often found dead, their wounds sometimes\r\nafford excellent means of identification. In many instances the\r\nmultiple character of these wounds is almost incredible. When on duty\r\nat the Army Medical Museum, in connection with the preparation of the\r\n“Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion,” I saw a man\r\nwho was literally wounded from the crown of his head to the sole of his\r\nfoot, the scars being fifty-two in number.\r\n\r\nWOUNDS MADE DURING LIFE might show the suggillation peculiar to\r\nbruises or traces of inflammation. Besides, the gaping nature of the\r\nlips of the wound, the fact of hemorrhage having taken place and the\r\ncoagulation of the blood, the infiltration of blood into the cellular\r\ntissue, etc., are surgical facts that would leave but little doubt as\r\nto the infliction of the wounds during life.\r\n\r\nThe _cause of death_ is often a difficult matter to determine, as\r\nit may have been accidental, suicidal, or the result of homicide.\r\nThe causes relating thereto are, moreover, so many and varied that\r\nspace and time compel a reference to other headings of this work. In\r\nforming an opinion as to _the probable date of death_ the extent of\r\nputrefaction is the chief guide. If death is quite recent, we may be\r\nguided by the post-mortem rigidity or the extent to which the body has\r\ncooled. The march of putrefactive decomposition would, of course, be\r\nregulated by circumstances. It takes place very rapidly in persons who\r\nhave succumbed to excessive fatigue or to any disassimilative excesses\r\nor derangement resulting in ante-mortem change of the tissues, such\r\nas those occurring in virulent or infectious diseases. The body of\r\nan infant decays more rapidly that that of an adult. The course of\r\nputrefactive phenomena is also influenced by the seasons, the extent\r\nof the exposure to air, and to other mesological causes. There is a\r\nmanifest difference in the special putrefactive change accordingly as\r\na body is buried in the earth, submerged in a fluid, thrown into a\r\ncesspool, or buried in a dung-heap.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases, especially where the body has been much mutilated, it\r\nmay be desirable to know whether there was _one or several murderers_.\r\nWhile no definite rule can be laid down on this point, we are justified\r\nin supposing that there were two or more assassins when the body of the\r\nvictim shows both gunshot and knife wounds, or that two persons were\r\nconcerned in the dismemberment and mutilation of a body which shows the\r\nsimultaneous presence of parts skilfully cut, while others show evident\r\nawkwardness.\r\n\r\nWhere there is _more than one mortal wound_ on the same dead body,\r\na question of medico-legal significance may arise. This occurred in\r\nthe Burton murder case at Newport, R. I., in 1885, which gave rise to\r\ndiscussion of the following abstract question: “Whether it is possible\r\nfor an individual, with suicidal intent, and in quick succession,\r\nto inflict a perforating shot of the head and another of the chest\r\nimplicating the heart. Or, reversing the proposition, is it incredible\r\nthat a person bent on self-destruction can, with his own hand, shoot\r\nhimself in the heart and in the head?”\r\n\r\nAfter consideration of the case referred to and reversal of the\r\nprevious decision of the coroner, the supposed suicide proved to be\r\na homicide. Yet if the abstract question of possibilities is alone\r\nregarded, there is no doubt of the fact that a suicide could shoot\r\nhimself in such manner, both in the head and the heart, or, changing\r\nthe order, of shots in the heart and in the head. The number of\r\ncases recorded establishes beyond a doubt the feasibility of the\r\nself-infliction of two such wounds, and make it clear that the theory\r\nof suicide may be maintained in such circumstances.[598]\r\n\r\n\r\nJUDICIAL ANTHROPOMETRY.\r\n\r\nOf late years the subject of anthropometric identification has taken\r\nsuch a place before justice that it cannot be ignored by the medical\r\nlegist. The facts of scientific anthropology have here been applied in\r\nsuch a way as to establish with great certainty both the present and\r\nfuture identity of individuals who attempt dissimulation of their name\r\nand antecedents. The method used principally in the identification\r\nof criminals and deserters from the army has been adopted in the\r\npublic service[599] and by most municipalities, with the exception of\r\nNew York, where the subsequent identification of persons connected\r\nwith municipal affairs has been and may be a source of no little\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\nThe system is based on three recognitory elements: photography,\r\nanthropometric measurements, and personal markings, from which a\r\ndescriptive list is made that gives absolute certainty as to individual\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\nOwing to the illusory nature of photography and the difficulty\r\nin finding the portrait of any given individual in the large and\r\nconstantly increasing collection of a “rogues’ gallery,” the matter\r\nhas been simplified and facilitated by grouping the photographic\r\ncollection according to the six anthropological coefficients of sex,\r\nstature, age, and color of the eyes. Each of these primordial groups is\r\nagain subdivided in such a way as to reduce the last group to a small\r\nnumber, when the portrait is easily found and verified on comparing the\r\nmeasurements of the head, of the extended arms, the length of the left\r\nfoot, and that of the left middle finger.\r\n\r\nThe photographic proof for each individual consists of two portraits\r\nside by side, one of which is taken full face, the other in profile of\r\nthe _right_ side. On the back of the photographic card is recorded with\r\nrigorous precision all personal markings or peculiarities.\r\n\r\nThe measurements, which can be made by any person of average\r\nintelligence in three or four minutes, are extremely simple. The\r\n_right_ ear is always measured, for the reason that this organ is\r\nalways reproduced in the traditional photograph which represents the\r\nright face. Other special measurements are taken on the left side. The\r\nheight sitting, dimensions and character of the nose, color of eyes,\r\netc., are also noted.\r\n\r\nIt is contended that by these measurements alone the identity of an\r\nindividual whose face is not even known may be established in another\r\ncountry by telegraph. The application of the system has proved of great\r\nservice in the apprehension of deserters from the United States army\r\n(when the authorities have been able to find the card), while it is\r\nclaimed to have caused the disappearance of numerous dissimulators of\r\nidentity in the prisons of Paris. The police authorities of that city\r\nreport that out of more than five hundred annual recognitions by the\r\nforegoing means, not one mistake has yet occurred.[600]\r\n\r\nTo avoid a _possible source of error_ mensuration of the organs and the\r\nascertainment of their form may be resorted to in the case of a cadaver\r\nthat is much decayed, or in one that has been purposely mutilated or\r\nburned by the assassin in order to prevent recognition. A sufficient\r\nnumber of cases may be cited in which the measurement of a limb or a\r\nbone of a deceased person known to have been lame or deformed during\r\nlife has resulted in the establishment of identity or the reverse.\r\n\r\nA mistake may be prevented in the case of supposed mutilation of a\r\ndrowned body, which may have been caused by the screw of a passing\r\nsteamer. Other errors may result from carelessness, incorrect\r\nobservation of signs, and neglect to follow the ordinary precautions\r\nthat should obtain in all researches on identity of the dead body.\r\n\r\nCertain circumstances indicative of the _mental state of the culprit_\r\nmay throw light on the identity. A person of unsound mind would\r\ncertainly be suggested as the perpetrator of such a deed as that of\r\nthe woman already mentioned, who after killing and cutting up her\r\ninfant, cooked portions of the remains with cabbage and served them\r\nat a meal of which she herself partook. Equally conclusive should be\r\nthe inference in the case cited by Maudsley of a person who, for no\r\nascertainable motive, kills a little girl, mutilates her remains, and\r\ncarefully records the fact in his note-book, with the remark that the\r\nbody was _hot and good_.\r\n\r\nThe _handwriting_ left by the assassin might also furnish a strong\r\npresumption as to the existence of a mental lesion, since the writing\r\nof the insane is often characteristic, especially in the initial stage\r\nof dementia. I recall the case of a former patient, an _aphasic_,\r\nimprisoned for having stabbed a man in the abdomen and for having\r\nwounded his wife in such a way that her arm had to be amputated. Having\r\nlost the power to express himself phonetically, this man used a book\r\nand pencil, but his writing showed a degree of _agraphia_ which alone\r\nwould establish his identity beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\nWhile it is quite possible that dishonest transactions, and even theft,\r\nmay take place by _telephone_ and the voices of the perpetrators may\r\nbe unmistakable between distant cities, it is more likely that the\r\nphonographic registration of speech or other sound by means of a\r\n_gramophone_ should become a matter of medico-legal investigation and a\r\npossible means that may lend great assistance in establishing personal\r\nidentity. Although no precedent may be cited, it is not going into\r\nthe domain of theoretical hypothesis to mention a discovery of such\r\nreal scientific certainty that for years after death, and thousands of\r\nmiles away, gives an indefinite number of reproductions that cannot\r\npossibly be mistaken by any one familiar with the voice before it had\r\nbecome “Edisonized.” Some gramophone disks lately shown me from Germany\r\nregistered greetings and messages to relatives in Washington, who were\r\ndelighted to recognize the exact reproduction of familiar tones and\r\naccents of the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nSo limitless is the field of research in this direction that there is\r\nscarcely an anthropological, biological, or medical discovery that\r\nmay not sooner or later be applied with profit in the investigations\r\nof personal identity where the combined efforts of an attorney and an\r\nexpert are required.\r\n\r\nAfter the most rigid and scrutinizing anatomical and material\r\nexamination is made and the closest inquisition entered on, it may\r\noften be impossible to give a reasonable explanation for the cause\r\nof the physical facts observed. The medical man should remember that\r\nhis is the one great exception to the rule that rigidly excludes\r\nopinions, and that scientific men called as witnesses may not give\r\ntheir opinion as to the general merits of the case, but only as to the\r\nfacts already proved. This qualifying rule being altogether reversed\r\nin investigations into personal identity, and the physician’s opinion\r\nas to identity being indispensable, it becomes a matter of most\r\nserious import that this opinion should be grounded upon absolute and\r\nwell-attested facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICO-LEGAL DETERMINATION\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHE TIME OF DEATH.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nH. P. LOOMIS, A.M., M.D.,\r\n\r\n_Professor of Pathology in the University of the City of New York;\r\nVisiting Physician and Curator to Bellevue Hospital, New York;\r\nPathologist to the Board of Health, New York City; President New York\r\nPathological Society, etc., etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICO-LEGAL DETERMINATION OF THE TIME OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF DEATH.\r\n\r\nTHE cessation of respiration and the absence of audible heart-beats\r\nare signs generally regarded as sufficient in themselves to determine\r\nthe reality of death. But persons have been resuscitated from a state\r\nof asphyxia or have recovered from a state of catalepsy or lethargy in\r\nwhom, _to all appearances_, the respiratory and circulatory processes\r\nhave been arrested.\r\n\r\nSo it is advisable that we should be acquainted with some absolute\r\ntests of death which are not connected with the heart-sounds or the\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that these important functions, although apparently\r\nheld in abeyance, must be speedily re-established so as to be\r\nrecognized, or death will rapidly follow. This condition of apparently\r\nsuspended animation is seen among hibernating animals; the bear, for\r\ninstance, will remain for four or five months without food or drink\r\nin a state of lethargy—the heart-action and respiration hardly\r\nappreciable. Yet it will be sufficiently rapid to sustain life during\r\nthe slow metabolic processes. A number of well-authenticated cases are\r\nreported in which persons could slacken their heart-action, so that\r\nno movement of the organ could be appreciated. The case of Colonel\r\nTownsend, reported by Cheyne, is an example. He possessed the power of\r\napparently dying, by slowing his heart so that there was no pulse or\r\nheart-action discernible. The longest period he could remain in this\r\ninanimate state was half an hour.\r\n\r\nInstances have occurred in the new-born child where without question\r\nthere have been no heart-beats or respiratory movements for a number of\r\nminutes, the limit being set at five.\r\n\r\nThese are exceptional cases, and it is setting at defiance all\r\nphysiological experience to suppose that the heart-action and\r\nrespiration can be suspended entirely when once they are established,\r\nfor a period as long. So, then, if no motion of the heart occurs during\r\na period of five minutes—a period five times as great as observation\r\nwarrants—death may be regarded as certain.\r\n\r\nThe respiratory movements of the chest are sometimes very difficult\r\nto observe. They can always be better appreciated if the abdomen and\r\nchest are observed together. There are two methods to determine whether\r\nrespiration is absolutely suspended or not. First, by holding a mirror\r\nin front of the open mouth, observing whether any moisture collects on\r\nits surface. Second, by placing on the chest a looking-glass or basin\r\nof water, and reflecting from it an image by artificial or sun light.\r\nThe slightest movement would be registered by a change in position of\r\nthe image. While the writer considers the absence of heart-beats and of\r\nrespiratory movement an absolute test of death, still some cases may\r\noccur in which the establishment of this test is very difficult, and\r\nthe following additional tests may be employed:\r\n\r\n1. Temperature of the body same as surrounding air.\r\n\r\n2. Intermittent shocks of electricity at different tensions passed into\r\nvarious muscles, giving no indication whatever of irritability.\r\n\r\n3. Careful movements of the joints of the extremities and of the lower\r\njaw, showing that rigor mortis is found in several parts.\r\n\r\n4. A bright needle plunged into the body of the biceps muscle\r\n(Cloquet’s needle test) and left there, showing on withdrawal no signs\r\nof oxidation.\r\n\r\n5. The opening of a vein, showing that the blood has undergone\r\ncoagulation.\r\n\r\n6. The subcutaneous injection of ammonia (Monte Verde’s test), causing\r\na dirty-brown stain indicative of dissolution.\r\n\r\n7. A fillet applied to the veins of the arm (Richardson’s test),\r\ncausing no filling of the veins on the distal side of the fillet.\r\n\r\n8. “Diaphanous test:” after death there is an absence of the\r\ntranslucence seen in living people when the hand is held before a\r\nstrong light with the fingers extended and in contact.\r\n\r\n9. “Eye test:” after death there is a loss of sensibility of the eye\r\nto light, loss of corneal transparency, and the pupil is not responsive\r\nto mydriatics.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM CHANGES.\r\n\r\nThe human body after death undergoes certain changes which will be\r\ndiscussed under the following heads:\r\n\r\n1. Cooling of the body.\r\n\r\n2. Flaccidity of the body.\r\n\r\n3. Rigor mortis.\r\n\r\n4. Changes in color due to\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Cadaveric ecchymoses.\r\n  (_b_) Putrefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOLING OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\nImmediately after death there is a slight rise of temperature, supposed\r\nto be due to the fact that the metabolic changes in the tissues still\r\ncontinue, while the blood is no longer cooled by passing through the\r\nperipheral capillaries and lungs.\r\n\r\nThe body gradually cools and reaches the temperature of the surrounding\r\nair in from fifteen to twenty hours; this is the ordinary course,\r\nbut the time may be influenced by a variety of causes, such as the\r\ncondition of the body at the time of death, manner of death, and\r\ncircumstances under which the body has been placed.\r\n\r\nIn certain diseases, as yellow fever, rheumatism, chorea, and tetanus,\r\nthe temperature of the body has been known to rise as high as 104° F.\r\nand remain so for a time. Again, it has been observed that when death\r\nhas taken place suddenly, as from accident, apoplexy, or acute disease,\r\nthe body retains its heat for a long time. The bodies of persons dying\r\nfrom hanging, electrocution, suffocation, or poisoning by carbon\r\ndioxide, do not generally cool for from twenty-four to forty-eight\r\nhours, and cases are recorded where three days have elapsed before the\r\nbody was completely cold. On the other hand, bodies dead from chronic\r\nwasting diseases or severe hemorrhage cool very rapidly, even in four\r\nor five hours.\r\n\r\nIn determining the temperature of a dead body the hand is not a\r\nreliable guide: the thermometer should always be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLACCIDITY.\r\n\r\nThe first effect of death from any cause is general relaxation of the\r\nentire muscular system. The lower jaw drops, the eyelids lose their\r\ntension, the limbs are flabby and soft, and the joints become flexible.\r\n\r\nIn from five to six hours after death, and generally while the body is\r\nin the act of cooling, the muscles of the limbs are observed to become\r\nhard and contracted, the joints stiff, and the body unyielding. Muscles\r\nwhich are contracted in the death-agony do not necessarily become\r\nrelaxed at any time.\r\n\r\nThe muscular tissues in the dead body can be considered as passing\r\nthrough three stages: (1) flaccid but contractile, (2) rigid and\r\nincapable of contraction, (3) relaxed and incapable of further\r\ncontractility.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGOR MORTIS.\r\n\r\nThis is sometimes called cadaveric rigidity and occurs generally within\r\nsix hours after death and disappears within sixteen to twenty-four\r\nhours. Many theories have been advanced to account for it, but the most\r\nprobable one is that the rigidity is due to the coagulation of the\r\nmyosin in the muscles by the weak acids which are no longer removed\r\nfrom the system; the muscles always give an acid reaction and are\r\nopaque instead of transparent; after putrefaction has set in ammonia is\r\ndeveloped, the myosin dissolved, and so flaccidity results.\r\n\r\nRigor mortis occurs first in the muscles of the eyelid, next the\r\nmuscles of the lower jaw and neck are affected, then the chest and\r\nupper extremities; afterward it gradually progresses from above\r\ndownward, affecting the muscles of the abdomen and lower limbs. The\r\nrigidity disappears in the same sequence. The period after death\r\nwhen rigor mortis manifests itself, together with its duration, is\r\nchiefly dependent upon the previous degree of muscular exhaustion.\r\nBrown-Séquard has demonstrated that the greater the degree of muscular\r\nirritability at the time of death, the later the cadaveric rigidity\r\nsets in and the longer it lasts. He has also shown that the later\r\nputrefaction sets in, the more slowly it progresses.\r\n\r\nThe more robust the individual and the shorter the disease, the more\r\nmarked and persistent is this muscular rigidity. It has been noticed\r\nthat the bodies of soldiers killed in the beginning of an engagement\r\nbecome rigid slowly, and those killed late quickly. This explains the\r\nreason why bodies are sometimes found on the battle-field in a kneeling\r\nor sitting posture with weapons in hand.\r\n\r\nIf the rigidity of rigor mortis after it is once complete is overcome,\r\nas in bending an arm, it never returns; but if incomplete it may\r\nreturn. This will serve at times to distinguish real death from\r\ncatalepsy and its allied conditions. While the _average_ duration of\r\nrigor mortis has been given as sixteen to twenty-four hours, it must\r\nbe remembered that in some cases it has been known to last only a few\r\nhours, as in death by lightning or by electrocution. In other cases it\r\nhas persisted for seven and fourteen days.\r\n\r\nThis long continuance of rigor mortis has been noted in death from\r\nstrychnine and other spinal poisons, in suffocation, and in poisoning\r\nby veratrum viride.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric conditions modify to a large extent the duration of rigor\r\nmortis. Dry, cold air causes it to last for a long time, while warm,\r\nmoist air shortens its duration. Also immersion in cold water brings on\r\nrigor mortis quickly and lengthens its duration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCADAVERIC ECCHYMOSIS—CADAVERIC LIVIDITY OR HYPOSTASIS.\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours after death the skin of the body, which is of a\r\npale, ashy-gray color, becomes covered by extensive patches of a bluish\r\nor purple color, which are most pronounced and are first seen on the\r\nback part of the trunk, head extremities, ears, face, and neck, and are\r\ndue to the blood, before coagulating, settling in the most dependent\r\nparts of the body, producing a mottling of the surface with irregular\r\nlivid patches. There is also a stagnation of blood in the capillary\r\nvessels, especially in those in the upper layer of the true skin or in\r\nthe space between the cuticle and cutis. The discoloration continues to\r\nincrease until the body is cold, when it is entirely arrested. Later\r\non, just before putrefaction begins, the color deepens, and the change\r\nappears to proceed from an infiltration of blood pigment into the\r\ndependent parts of the body.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the discolorations are appearing on the surface of the\r\nbody, _internal hypostasis_ is also taking place, most marked in the\r\ndependent portions of the brain, lungs, intestines, kidneys, and spinal\r\ncord.\r\n\r\nThis condition in the brain may be mistaken for so-called congestive\r\napoplexy; in the lungs, for pulmonary apoplexy or the first stage\r\nof lobar pneumonia; in the intestines and spinal meninges, for the\r\nbeginning of inflammatory changes.\r\n\r\nThe position of these hypostases will afford the best correction for\r\nthis possible error. The appearances presented by cadaveric ecchymoses\r\nhave often been mistaken for the effects of violence applied during\r\nlife. Innocent persons have been accused and tried for murder or\r\nmanslaughter on charges afterward proved to be groundless. Therefore it\r\nis of the utmost importance that the medical jurist should be able to\r\ndistinguish between ante-mortem and post-mortem ecchymoses.\r\n\r\nThe following are the points of difference:\r\n\r\n1. Situation. Post-mortem ecchymoses are seen on that portion of the\r\nbody which has been most dependent, generally the posterior aspect,\r\nand they involve principally the superficial layers of the true skin;\r\nante-mortem ecchymoses may occur anywhere, and generally the deeper\r\ntissues are discolored.\r\n\r\n2. In cadaveric lividity there is no elevation of the skin and the\r\ndiscoloration terminates abruptly.\r\n\r\n3. After cutting into the tissues where an ecchymosis has been produced\r\nby violence, the blood without the vessels is free in the tissue; this\r\nis not so in cadaveric ecchymosis.\r\n\r\n4. Post-mortem ecchymoses are very extensive, ante-mortem generally\r\nlimited in area.\r\n\r\nA peculiar appearance of cadaveric lividity is observed in bodies\r\nwhich have been wrapped in a sheet and allowed to cool or that have\r\ncooled in their clothing. It occurs in the form of bands or stripes\r\nover the whole surface, and often gives an appearance as of a person\r\nflogged. The explanation of this appearance is that the congestion of\r\nthe vessels takes place in the interstices of the folds, while the\r\nparts compressed remain whole. The unbroken condition of the cuticle,\r\ntogether with the other characteristics just mentioned, are sufficient\r\nto distinguish these ecchymoses from those produced by violence. While\r\ncadaveric lividity is seen in all bodies after death, it is especially\r\npronounced in those persons who have died suddenly in full health or\r\nby violence, as from apoplexy, hanging, drowning, or suffocation. It\r\nis very slight in the bodies of those who have died from hemorrhage or\r\nanæmia.\r\n\r\nThe time at which cadaveric lividity appears varies greatly. Casper,\r\nwho has investigated the subject thoroughly, sets the time at from\r\ntwelve to fifteen hours after death.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTREFACTION.\r\n\r\nAt a period varying from a few hours to three days after death, certain\r\nchanges are seen in the human body which show that putrefaction has\r\ncommenced. A change of color appears first upon the middle of the\r\nabdomen and gradually spreads over the rest of the body; it is first\r\npale green, which gradually deepens, and finally becomes purplish or\r\nbrown. This change in color is due to the action on the hæmoglobin of\r\nthe gases developed by decomposition. Similar discoloration makes its\r\nappearance on the chest, between the ribs, on the face, the neck, the\r\nlegs, and lastly on the arms, where it is more marked along the large\r\nvenous trunks, and has sometimes been mistaken for marks of violence.\r\nThe eyeballs become flaccid, and if exposed to the air the conjunctiva\r\nand cornea become dry and brown. Gases are formed, not only in the\r\nhollow organs of the abdomen but also in the skin. Those developed in\r\nthe cavities of the head and face force frothy, reddish fluid or mucus\r\nfrom the mouth and nostrils, and may cause swelling of the features and\r\nprotrusion of the eyes and tongue. It must be remembered that the gases\r\nwhile producing distention of the abdomen may also cause changes in the\r\nposition of the blood and slight displacement of the organs; they may\r\nalso force undigested food into the mouth and into the larynx, and so\r\nlead to suspicion of death from suffocation.\r\n\r\nAs putrefaction advances, after a period of five or six days the entire\r\nsurface of the body becomes green or brown, the cuticle becomes loose\r\nand easily detached; the tissues flaccid and often bathed in a reddish\r\nserum in such situations as the neck, the groin, and the back part of\r\nthe scalp. The thorax and abdomen become enormously distended, the\r\nfeatures distorted and scarcely recognizable, and the hair and nails\r\nloosened. Beyond this, it is impossible to follow the changes leading\r\nto disintegration with any degree of certainty. The changes which I\r\nhave just described as produced by putrefaction are the _ordinary_\r\nones seen in a body exposed to the air at a moderate temperature, but\r\nit must be remembered that the time and rapidity of the development of\r\nthese changes may be influenced by a large number of factors, and that\r\nthey are of very little importance in estimating the time of death. I\r\nhave seen bodies buried two months that have shown fewer of the changes\r\nproduced by putrefaction than others dead but a week.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a body buried in a coffin will be as follows after a\r\nperiod varying from a few months to one or two years. The soft tissues\r\nwill have become dry and brown and the face and limbs covered with a\r\nsoft white fungus. Hard white crystalline deposits of calcium phosphate\r\nwill be found on the surface of the soft organs, and when found on\r\nthe surface of the stomach care should be taken not to confound them\r\nwith the effects of poison. In time the viscera become so mixed\r\ntogether that it is difficult to distinguish them. For the most part\r\nthe changes that take place in a body buried in a coffin are similar,\r\nbut much slower, to those that occur if the body is exposed to the air\r\nor buried in soil. Even under apparently identical circumstances the\r\nmost varied results have been observed, so it is not possible for a\r\nmedical jurist to fix a definite period of death or the time of burial\r\nfrom the appearance of an exhumed body. For example, Taylor records a\r\ncase where after thirty-four years’ interment an entire and perfect\r\nskeleton was discovered, surrounded by traces of shroud and coffin,\r\nwhile in an adjoining grave all that remained of a body that had been\r\ndead twenty-five years were the long bones and base of the skull, In\r\none case a body was found well preserved after six years’ burial and in\r\nanother after even thirty years’ interment.\r\n\r\nThis brings us next to a consideration of those factors that favor or\r\nretard decomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES FAVORING PUTREFACTION.\r\n\r\n1. =Temperature.=—Putrefaction advances most rapidly at a temperature\r\nbetween 70° and 100° F. It may commence at any temperature above 50°\r\nF., but it is wholly arrested at 32° F. So one day’s exposure of a\r\nbody in summer may effect greater changes than one week in winter.\r\nAfter freezing, putrefaction takes place with unusual rapidity upon\r\nthe thawing out of the body. A temperature of 212° F. stops all\r\nputrefactive changes.\r\n\r\n2. =Moisture.=—Putrefaction takes place only in the presence of\r\nmoisture. An excess of moisture, however, seems to retard the process,\r\npossibly by cutting off the excess of air. The viscera according to\r\nthe amount of water they contain decompose at different times after\r\ndeath—for instance, the brain and eye rapidly, the bones and hair\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n3. =Air.=—Exposure to air favors decomposition by carrying to the body\r\nthe micro-organisms which bring about putrefaction; absence of air soon\r\narrests the changes: this is seen in bodies hermetically sealed in\r\nlead coffins, which remain unchanged for a long period of time. Moist\r\nrather than dry air favors putrefaction by lessening evaporation. Air\r\nin motion retards while still air favors the change.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that a body decomposes more rapidly in air than\r\nin water or after burial. Given similar temperatures, the amount of\r\nputrefaction observed in a body dead one week and exposed to the air\r\nwill about correspond to one submerged in water for two weeks or buried\r\nin a deep grave for eight weeks.\r\n\r\n4. =Age.=—The bodies of children decompose much more rapidly than\r\nthose of adults; fœtuses still more rapidly. Aged bodies decompose\r\nslowly, probably on account of a deficiency of moisture. Fat and flabby\r\nbodies decompose quickly for the same reason.\r\n\r\n5. =Cause of Death.=—In cases of sudden death, as from accident or\r\nviolence, the body decomposes more rapidly than when death results\r\nfrom disease. Putrefaction sets in early in death from the infectious\r\nfevers, such as typhus, pyæmia, and typhoid fever, also in death from\r\nsuffocation by smoke or coal gas, by strangulation or after narcotic\r\npoisoning. Those parts of a body which are the seat of bruises,\r\nwounds, or fractures, decompose rapidly; this is especially seen in\r\nparts after a surgical operation.\r\n\r\n6. =Manner of Burial.=—When a body is buried in low ground in a damp,\r\nswampy, clay soil, decomposition advances rapidly, as also when the\r\ngrave is shallow so the body can be exposed to constant variations of\r\ntemperature. A porous soil impregnated with animal and vegetable matter\r\nfavors putrefaction, as also burying a body without clothes or coffin;\r\nthis is especially seen where infants have been thrown into the ground\r\nand loosely covered with earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES RETARDING PUTREFACTION.\r\n\r\n1. =The Temperature.=—Below 32° F. and above 212° F. putrefaction is\r\nentirely arrested. The rapidity of the change considerably lessens as\r\nthe temperature advances above 100° F. A remarkable instance of the\r\npreservative power of cold is given by Adolph Erman, who states that\r\nthe body of Prince Menschikoff, a favorite of Peter the Great, exhumed\r\nafter ninety-two years’ burial in frozen soil, had undergone hardly any\r\nchange. Buried in hot sand as is seen in the desert, a body putrefies\r\nvery slowly and generally becomes mummified.\r\n\r\n2. =Moisture.=—Absence of moisture retards decomposition. In the dry\r\nair of the desert bodies have been preserved for a long period of time.\r\n\r\n3. =Air.=—If access of air to a body be prevented in any way by its\r\ninclosure in a coffin, by closely fitting clothes, or by complete\r\nimmersion in water, putrefaction is retarded.\r\n\r\n4. =Age.=—Adults and old people decompose more slowly than children.\r\nMales are said to change less rapidly than females, lean people than\r\nfleshy ones.\r\n\r\n5. =Cause of Death.=—Putrefaction is delayed after death from chronic\r\ndiseases unless they are associated with dropsy. Poisoning by alcohol,\r\nchloroform, strychnine, and arsenic retard putrefaction. In the latter\r\ncase the putrefactive changes seem to stop after they have once\r\ncommenced, and often a result very similar to mummification is seen.\r\nDeath from the mineral acids, especially sulphuric, appears to delay\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\n6. =Manner of Burial.=—Putrefaction is retarded by burial a short\r\ntime after death; by interment on high ground, in dry, sandy, or\r\ngravelly soil; by having the grave deep, over six feet in depth if\r\npossible by the body being well wrapped and secured in a tight coffin,\r\na lead one being the best in this respect. Lime or charcoal applied\r\nfreely about a body will retard decomposition, as will also injection\r\nof the body through the arteries with such substances as arsenic,\r\nchloride of zinc, or antimony. The ultimate effect of putrefaction\r\nis to reduce all bodies to inorganic compounds, chiefly water,\r\nammonia, and carbon dioxide. Three conditions are necessary for its\r\nestablishment, (1) a given temperature, (2) moisture, (3) free access\r\nof air.\r\n\r\nThe order in which the various organs and tissues undergo\r\ndecomposition, as given by Casper, who has investigated the subject\r\ncarefully, is as follows: Trachea and larynx, brain of infants, stomach\r\nand intestines, spleen, omentum and mesentery, liver, brain of adults,\r\nheart and lungs, kidney, bladder and œsophagus, pancreas, large\r\nvessels, and last of all the uterus.\r\n\r\nAs the result of putrefaction, fluids, generally blood-stained, collect\r\nin the serous cavities of the body, and should not be confounded\r\nwith serous effusions occurring during life. So also the softening\r\nof the organs and tissue resulting from decomposition should be\r\ncarefully distinguished from those resulting from inflammation. These\r\ncadaveric softenings are most frequently found in the brain, spleen,\r\nand gastro-intestinal mucous membrane. Inflammatory softenings are\r\ndifferentiated by being rarely general but almost always limited, by\r\nthe substance of the inflamed part being infiltrated with serum or\r\npus and showing traces of vascular injection. In doubtful cases the\r\npathologist should have recourse to the microscope.\r\n\r\nAs the result of putrefaction, various changes take place in the mucous\r\nmembrane of the stomach and intestines which simulate the effects\r\nof poisons. The color of the stomach varies from red, which becomes\r\nbrighter on exposure to the air, to a brown, slate, or livid purple. We\r\ncan only presume that these color-changes are the result of irritant\r\npoisons when they are found in non-dependent parts and parts not in\r\ncontact with organs engorged with blood, when they are seen soon after\r\ndeath, and when the membrane is covered with coagulated blood, mucus,\r\nor flakes of membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS ON PUTREFACTION OF SUBMERSION IN WATER.\r\n\r\nThere are certain modifications of the putrefactive changes when bodies\r\nhave been submerged in water. In the first place, the changes are much\r\nless rapid; they often do not show themselves until about the twelfth\r\nday, and then as discolorations appearing generally first about the\r\nears and temples, then on the face, from which they spread to the neck,\r\nshoulders, chest, abdomen, and finally to the legs. This is almost the\r\ninverse order of the putrefactive changes in bodies exposed to the air.\r\nAs a result of the formation of gases, the body in a short time becomes\r\nbuoyant; after floating on the surface of the water for a time, the\r\ngases escape and the body sinks, rising a second time when fresh gas\r\nhas formed.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of decomposition in water varies, being most rapid when\r\nthe temperature is from 64° to 68° F. Stagnant as well as shallow water\r\nfavors putrefaction. If a body becomes coated with mud the change is\r\ndelayed. Submersion in a cesspool also retards it, and the conditions\r\nare such as to favor the formation of adipocere.\r\n\r\nAfter a body has been removed from the water an exposure of a very few\r\nhours to the air causes rapid decomposition, so that in twenty-four\r\nhours more marked changes may occur than would have resulted from a\r\nfortnight’s longer submersion. The face soon becomes bloated and black,\r\nso that identification is well-nigh impossible. It is quite important\r\nin medico-legal cases to estimate the time which has elapsed since\r\ndeath in bodies found submersed in water. The following are the various\r\nchanges ordinarily seen at different periods of time, as estimated by\r\nDevergie, who has especially investigated the subject:\r\n\r\n=First Four or Five Days.=—Little change: rigor mortis may persist,\r\nparticularly if the water is cold.\r\n\r\n=Fourth or Fifth Day.=—Skin of the ball of the thumb and little\r\nfinger, also the lateral surface of the fingers, begins to whiten. This\r\nwhitening gradually extends to the palms of the hands and soles of the\r\nfeet. The skin of the face will appear softened and of a more faded\r\nwhite than the rest of the body.\r\n\r\n=Fifteenth Day.=—Face slightly swollen and red; a greenish spot\r\nbegins to form on the neck and skin of the mid-sternum. The skin of the\r\nhands and feet is quite white and wrinkled. The subcutaneous cellular\r\ntissue of the thorax is reddish and the upper part of the cortical\r\nsubstance of the brain of a greenish tint.\r\n\r\n=At One Month.=—The face is reddish-brown, the eyelids and lips green\r\nand swollen, and the neck slightly green. A greenish discoloration is\r\nalso seen over the upper and middle part of the sternum. The skin is\r\nwrinkled. The hair and nails still remain intact. The scrotum and penis\r\nare distended by gas. The lungs become very emphysematous and overlap\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAPONIFICATION.\r\n\r\nWhen the bodies were removed from the Cimetière des Innocents in Paris,\r\nin 1786, Fourcray observed that many of them had been converted into\r\na substance which he termed ADIPOCERE. He gave it this name because\r\nit resembles both fat (_adeps_) and wax (_cera_). Under certain\r\ncircumstances which will be considered later, it is known to be a\r\nlate product of the putrefactive processes. Adipocere is a substance\r\nof a cheese-like consistency, yellow or yellowish-brown in color,\r\nand composed chiefly of a mixture of the fatty acids. Chevreul has\r\nshown by analysis that it is a true ammoniacal soap, but that when\r\nformed in water impregnated with lime a calcareous may be substituted\r\nfor an ammoniacal base. This may take place either in a body exposed\r\nto river-water or buried in a grave wet by water containing calcium\r\ncarbonate or sulphate. Saponification can only take place when animal\r\nfat is in contact with nitrogenous matter. Neither fat nor fibrin when\r\nkept separate will saponify. Skin deprived of all its fat will not be\r\ntransformed into adipocere.\r\n\r\nSaponification commences in the fat of the female breast, of the cheeks\r\nand other parts of the body where large accumulations of fat are found,\r\nsuch as around the kidneys and in the omentum. As fat is distributed\r\nextensively throughout the body, nearly all parts may undergo this\r\ntransformation. Taylor gives the following conditions as favorable to\r\nthe change:\r\n\r\n1. Bodies of young persons, because the fat is abundant and chiefly\r\nexternal.\r\n\r\n2. Bodies of corpulent adults.\r\n\r\n3. Exposure of bodies to the soil of water-closets.\r\n\r\n4. The immersion of bodies in water, the change taking place more\r\nrapidly in running than in stagnant water.\r\n\r\n5. Humid soil, especially when bodies are placed in it one upon the\r\nother. In this case the lowest of them is first changed.\r\n\r\nWhen a body has been completely saponified it may remain in this state\r\nfor years. In one instance, after seventeen years’ burial many of the\r\norgans could still be recognized.\r\n\r\nThe time required for saponification to take place is sometimes of\r\nmedico-legal importance. Three years are _usually_ necessary for bodies\r\nburied in the earth. The change occurs more rapidly in water. Cases are\r\nrecorded where the body of a new-born child was completely saponified\r\nin six weeks, and again, the change had commenced in a body which had\r\nbeen in the water about four months; but these are unusual cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nDATA UPON WHICH OPINION AS TO TIME OF DEATH IS FORMED.\r\n\r\nThe changes which take place in a body before putrefaction sets in may\r\nenable a medical jurist to form an opinion as to the probable time\r\nwhich has elapsed since death; yet it must be remembered, to pronounce\r\nthe time which has elapsed can only be done approximately, for very\r\nmany conditions will have to be considered, which will vary in each\r\nindividual case. The importance of considering the minutest detail is\r\nwell illustrated by the death of Prince de Condé, Duke of Bourbon,\r\nwho was found dead in his bedroom in the chateau of St. Cyr. When\r\ndiscovered at 8 o’clock in the morning, the deceased was found partly\r\nundressed, hanging by his cravat to one of the window shutters. The\r\nbody was cold and the lower extremities rigid. As in asphyxia from\r\nhanging the warmth of the body is usually preserved longer than under\r\ncommon circumstances, viz., from twelve to fifteen hours, before which\r\nperiod rigidity is seldom complete, the medical examiner inferred that\r\nthe deceased must have died very soon after he retired to his bedroom\r\non the previous night. As this was proven to have been 10 P.M., it\r\nfollowed that only ten hours had elapsed—a short time for cooling and\r\nrigidity to have taken place. It was thus rendered probable that the\r\nhanging took place soon after deceased reached his bedroom. It was\r\nalleged that the duke had been murdered, and that his body had been\r\nafterward suspended to create a suspicion of suicide. The condition of\r\nthe body was, among other things, adverse to this opinion. From 10 to\r\n12 o’clock it was proved there were numerous attendants moving about\r\nnear the duke’s apartments. They would have heard any unusual noise the\r\nduke must have made in resisting his assailant. But no noise was heard\r\nin the room at that or any other time, and the presumption of this\r\nbeing a homicide was thus strongly rebutted.\r\n\r\n=Cadaveric rigidity=, while often it will aid to, is not a reliable\r\nguide. When once it is established it may remain two, three, or four\r\ndays, according to the season of the year and other circumstances, and\r\nwhen it exists there is no rule by which it can be determined whether a\r\nbody has been in this state three hours or three days.\r\n\r\n=Putrefaction=, while appearing on an average, under a mean\r\ntemperature, in from three to six days, is yet influenced by many\r\ncircumstances. The heat and moisture of the surroundings, the age, sex,\r\namount of flesh on the body, mode of death, position and coverings of\r\nbody, all must be considered.\r\n\r\n=The temperature= of the body aids us, yet the retention of warmth by\r\nthe abdominal viscera may be met with in a marked degree twenty hours\r\nafter death; in one case, personally known to me, the thermometer\r\nregistered 76° F. seventeen hours after death.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the body, its rigidity, and the evidences of\r\nputrefaction all furnish data from which we can estimate the _probable_\r\ntime which has elapsed since death. It must be remembered that no one\r\nof them furnishes any positive proof.\r\n\r\nSome medical jurists have attempted to give a more definite character\r\nto these changes in the recently dead body by dividing the interval\r\nbetween the stopping of the heart’s action and the beginning of\r\nputrefaction into three periods. In the first, the warmth, pliability,\r\nand muscular irritability remain. In the second, these conditions are\r\nlost and the body is cold and rigid. In the third, the body is cold\r\nand pliant, the muscles are relaxed, and the joints are flexible, the\r\ncadaveric rigidity having entirely ceased.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt about the existence of these stages, but when we\r\ncome to define the precise time at which one begins and the other ends,\r\nwe find it impossible. For example, the first stage embraces a period\r\nwhich cannot be more closely defined than by stating that the person\r\nmay have been dead from a few minutes to twenty hours—a statement too\r\nvague to be upheld by a counsel who defends a prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe changes which take place in these periods and the average time they\r\nlast have been given as follows by Devergie:\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD, _Few Minutes to Twenty Hours_.—Characterized by warmth\r\nof the body and general or partial relaxation of the voluntary muscles.\r\nTo what portion of this period the special case belongs must be\r\nestimated according to the degree of heat in the trunk and extremities\r\nand the degree of rigidity in the muscles, the neck and the jaws\r\ncommonly showing this condition first, the legs last. Warmth of the\r\nbody rarely remains as long as twenty hours; in general it is sensibly\r\ncold in from ten to twelve hours. During this period the muscles are\r\nsusceptible of contraction under the galvanic current, and in the early\r\nstage under the stimulus of blows.\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD, _Ten Hours to Three Days_.—The body is perfectly cold\r\nthroughout and rigidity is well marked. The muscles no longer respond\r\nto stimuli. The duration of this period seems long, yet in one instance\r\nthe body will be found cold and rigid nine hours after death. Again,\r\ncooling and rigidity may not come on for three or four days.\r\n\r\nTHIRD PERIOD, _Three to Eight Days_.—The body is perfectly cold. The\r\nlimbs and trunk pliant and free from cadaveric rigidity. The muscles\r\nare not capable of contracting. In summer this period is much shorter;\r\noften it will come on before three days.\r\n\r\nPutrefaction commences when a body is kept under the most favorable\r\nconditions, in from six to twelve days, as a slight greenish\r\ndiscoloration of the abdomen which gradually spreads throughout the\r\nbody. The time at which putrefaction shows itself and the rapidity with\r\nwhich it advances is dependent upon so many factors, many of which\r\nit is impossible often for the medical examiner to ascertain, that\r\ntoo much reliance must not be placed upon it. Casper estimates the\r\nfollowing to be the _average_ changes generally found in the periods of\r\ntime given:\r\n\r\nTWENTY-FOUR TO SEVENTY-TWO HOURS after death a slight green color is\r\nvisible over the centre of the abdomen. The eyeballs are soft and yield\r\nto external pressure.\r\n\r\nTHREE TO FIVE DAYS after death the green color of the abdomen becomes\r\nintensified and general, spreading if the body be exposed to the air or\r\nburied in the ground in the following order: genitals, breast, face,\r\nneck, upper and lastly lower extremities.\r\n\r\nEIGHT TO TEN DAYS after death the discoloration becomes more\r\nintense, the face and neck presenting a shade of reddish-green. The\r\nramifications of the superficial veins on the neck, breast, and limbs\r\nbecome very apparent. Finally the patches congregate. Gases begin to be\r\ndeveloped and distend the abdomen and hollow organs and to form under\r\nthe skin in the subcutaneous and intermuscular tissue. The cornea falls\r\nin and becomes concave. The sphincter ani relaxes.\r\n\r\nFOURTEEN TO TWENTY-ONE DAYS after death the discoloration over the\r\nwhole body becomes intensely green, with brownish-red or brownish-black\r\npatches. The body is bloated and appears greatly increased in size\r\nfrom the development of gases within the abdomen, thorax, and scrotum,\r\nand also in the cellular tissue of the body generally. The swollen\r\ncondition of the eyelids, lips, nose, and cheeks is usually of such\r\nextent as to obliterate the features and to destroy the identity of the\r\nbody. The epidermis peels off in patches, while in certain parts, more\r\nparticularly the feet, it will be raised in blisters filled with red or\r\ngreenish liquid, the cuticle underneath frequently appearing blanched.\r\nThe color of the iris is lost. The nails easily separate and the hair\r\nbecomes loosened.\r\n\r\nFOURTH TO SIXTH MONTH after death the thorax and abdomen burst and the\r\nsutures of the skull give way from the development of gases within the\r\nhead. The viscera appear pulpy, or perhaps disappear, leaving the bones\r\nexposed. The bones of the extremities separate at the joints. At an\r\nadvanced stage the soft parts gradually disappear.\r\n\r\nIn giving an opinion as to how long a time has elapsed since death when\r\na body has undergone marked putrefactive changes, we must consider\r\ncarefully not only the conditions of the organs, but the mode of death\r\nand the “surroundings.” By these I mean the quantity of clothing worn,\r\nthe depth of the grave in which the body has been interred, the season\r\nof the year, the heat and moisture of the atmosphere. The question\r\nsometimes presents itself to the medical examiner, Of two persons\r\nfound dead, which died first? The importance of this point was well\r\nillustrated in the “Lizzie Borden case.” By a careful consideration of\r\nall the conditions presented by each body in the ways I have indicated,\r\nthe question will not ordinarily be a difficult one to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nMEDICO-LEGAL CONSIDERATION\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nWOUNDS,\r\n\r\nINCLUDING\r\n\r\nPUNCTURED AND INCISED WOUNDS, AND WOUNDS MADE BY BLUNT INSTRUMENTS\r\nOTHER THAN GUNSHOT WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nGEORGE WOOLSEY, A.B., M.D.,\r\n\r\n_Professor of Anatomy and Clinical Surgery in the Medical Department of\r\nthe University of the City of New York; Surgeon to Bellevue Hospital;\r\nMember Medical Society of the County of New York, New York Academy of\r\nMedicine, New York Surgical Society, etc., etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nTHE surgical and medico-legal ideas of wounds are quite different, the\r\nlatter including the former as well as other varieties of injuries.\r\n\r\n=Definitions.=—Surgically a _wound_ means a solution of continuity and\r\nrefers to every such lesion produced by external violence or developing\r\nspontaneously. The medico-legal acceptation of the term is much broader\r\nand includes any injury or lesion caused by mechanical or chemical\r\nmeans. Vibert[601] quotes Foderé as defining a wound medico-legally as,\r\n“Every lesion of the human body by a violent cause of which the results\r\nare, singly or combined, concussion, contusion, puncture, incision,\r\ntear, burn, twist, fracture, luxation, etc.; whether the cause is\r\ndirected against the body or the body against the cause.” The same\r\nauthor quotes another definition of a wound as, “Every lesion however\r\nslight, resulting in concerning or affecting the body or health of an\r\nindividual.” Taylor[602] defines a wound in a medico-legal sense as “a\r\nbreach of continuity in the structures of the body whether external or\r\ninternal, suddenly occasioned by mechanical violence.” Thus, the term\r\nwound in its medico-legal acceptation includes not only surgical wounds\r\nbut contusions, fractures, burns, concussion, etc. In France at least\r\nthe voluntary inoculation of syphilis has been considered as coming\r\nunder the category of wounds.[603]\r\n\r\nMedico-legally, the severity of a wound is much more important than\r\nthe kind of wound. Thus we may consider wounds according to their\r\ncomparative gravity, as mortal, severe, or slight.\r\n\r\nA _mortal_ wound is one which is directly fatal to life in a\r\ncomparatively short time, usually from hemorrhage, shock, or the injury\r\nof a vital part. A wound may result fatally without being a mortal\r\nwound, as when a slight wound causes death on account of some wound\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n_Severe wounds_, or “wounds causing grievous bodily harm,” as they have\r\nlong been called, do not put life in imminent danger, though they may\r\nbe inconvenient or detrimental to health. Pollock, C. B., says that a\r\nwound causing grievous bodily harm is “any wound requiring treatment.”\r\n\r\nA medical opinion or certificate may be required as to the danger of a\r\ngiven wound, and on this opinion may depend the question of bail for\r\nthe prisoner. By the danger of a wound in such a case is usually meant\r\nimminent danger, as any wound may be remotely dangerous to life.\r\n\r\n_Slight wounds_, as already stated, may result fatally under certain\r\nconditions. Under the French practice a slight wound is one which does\r\nnot incapacitate one from work for more than twenty days. Looked at\r\nin another way, slight or severe wounds may be classified according\r\nas they are completely curable, leaving no infirmity or disturbance\r\nof function, or not completely curable. The latter are such as are\r\nnecessarily followed by permanent or temporary infirmity.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the severity of any given wound may sometimes be\r\nleft to the jury to decide from the description of the wound, or a\r\nmedical opinion may be required.\r\n\r\nAlthough the intent of the assailant is often of equal or greater\r\nimportance than the severity or kind of wound, yet this can only\r\noccasionally be inferred from the surgical aspects of the wound.\r\n\r\nThe classes of wounds to be treated in the following pages are incised\r\nand punctured wounds and wounds with blunt instruments, some of the\r\ncharacteristics of which we will now consider.\r\n\r\n=Incised wounds= are such as are produced by a cutting instrument, and\r\nthey are distinguished by the following characteristics: They measure\r\nmore in length than in the other dimensions. They are usually straight\r\nin _direction_, though not infrequently curved, and they may even be\r\nzig-zag, especially where the skin lies in folds. The _edges_ of an\r\nincised wound are linear, and show no signs of contusion. They are\r\neither inverted or everted and the edges and sides of the wound are\r\nretracted. The eversion of the skin is due to its elasticity, but in\r\nsome regions of the body, _e.g._, in the scrotum, etc., the skin is\r\ninverted owing to the contraction of the muscle fibres immediately\r\nbeneath. The gaping of the wound is due to the retraction of the\r\ndivided muscles and fibrous structures. It varies according as the\r\nmuscles are cut directly across or more lengthwise, and in proportion\r\nto the distance of the wound from the points of attachment of the\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nThe fibrous tissues, fasciæ, and aponeuroses retract less, and so give\r\na somewhat irregular surface to a large wound.\r\n\r\nOgston[604] divides incised wounds into three parts, the commencement,\r\ncentre, and end, of which the end often has two or more serrations\r\ndiffering from the commencement, which has but a single point. There\r\nare often one or more slight, superficial, tentative incisions situated\r\nalmost always, though not invariably, near the commencement.[605] The\r\ndeepest part of the wound is more often near the commencement. If\r\nthere are angular flaps on the edges their free angles point to the\r\ncommencement of the wound.\r\n\r\nCoagula and clots of blood are to be found in the wound, more or less\r\nfilling it up if it has not been interfered with. On examination the\r\nends of the divided vessels are found plugged with clots which may\r\nprotrude somewhat from their openings.\r\n\r\nIf the wound is seen very shortly after its infliction, hemorrhage is\r\nin progress, and the divided arteries show their position by their\r\nindividual, intermittent jets of blood. The severity of incised wounds\r\ndepends upon the amount of hemorrhage, which is greater the deeper and\r\nlarger the wound, and the more vascular the tissues in which it occurs,\r\nespecially if large and important vessels are concerned. In the latter\r\ncase an incised wound may be very rapidly fatal.\r\n\r\nIncised wounds present the least favorable conditions for the\r\nspontaneous arrest of hemorrhage of any form of wounds. The edges of an\r\nincised wound may be quite rough and even dentated or lacerated if the\r\nedge of the weapon be rough and irregular.\r\n\r\nThe kind and condition of a weapon which has produced a given incised\r\nwound may often be learned by an examination of the characteristics of\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\nWeapons cutting by their weight as well as by the sharpness of their\r\nedges, such as axes, etc., may cause a certain amount of contusion\r\nabout a wound; they crush the soft parts to a certain extent, and the\r\nbones may be indented or even fractured.\r\n\r\nWounds caused by fragments of bottles, pieces of china, earthenware,\r\nor glass, though strictly speaking incised wounds, are often curved,\r\nangular, and irregular, and their edges jagged and contused.\r\n\r\nWounds caused by scissors may sometimes be of the nature of incised\r\nwounds. When they present a double wound of triangular shape, with the\r\napex of the triangle blunt, they are more of the nature of punctured\r\nwounds. In general a “tail” or long angle in the skin at one end of an\r\nincised wound indicates the end of the wound last inflicted, and some\r\nlight may thus be thrown upon the inflicter of the wound.\r\n\r\nIncised wounds present very favorable conditions for healing by primary\r\nunion, but often fail in this and heal by secondary union. When an\r\nincised wound fails to unite by primary union, bleeding continues\r\nfor several hours or even as long as a day, the blood being mixed\r\nmore or less with a serous discharge. The latter continues until the\r\nthird day or so. By the fourth or fifth day the surface has begun to\r\ngranulate, and there may be a more or less profuse purulent discharge\r\nfrom the surface. The granulating surfaces do not necessarily discharge\r\npus, however. For some days, therefore, after the infliction of an\r\nincised wound, or until the surface is covered with granulations, the\r\ncharacteristics of the wound permit of a diagnosis as to the nature of\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\nThe _diagnosis_ of an incised wound is generally without difficulty.\r\nSome wounds by blunt instruments, however, in certain regions of the\r\nbody, resemble incised wounds very closely. Such instances are found\r\nwhere a firm, thin layer of skin and subjacent tissue lies directly\r\nover a bony surface or a sharp ridge of bone. These are seen most often\r\nin the scalp or in wounds of the eyebrow where the sharp supra-orbital\r\nridge cuts through the skin from beneath. The diagnosis of an incised\r\nwound can often be made with great probability from the cicatrix. This\r\nis especially the case if the wound has healed by primary union and the\r\ncicatrix is linear.\r\n\r\nThe _prognosis_ in incised wounds is good as to life unless a large\r\nvessel has been divided or unless an important viscus has been\r\npenetrated. The prognosis as to function varies with the position and\r\nextent of the wound, and the circumstance of the healing of the wound.\r\n\r\n=Punctured Wounds, Stabs, etc.=—These are characterized by narrowness\r\nas compared to depth, though the depth is not necessarily great.\r\nThey are more varied in character than incised wounds owing to the\r\ngreat variety of form of the weapons by which they may be made. From\r\nthe form, etc., of a particular wound we may often infer the variety\r\nof weapon by which it was produced. According to the weapon used,\r\npunctured wounds have been divided into several classes, of which M.\r\nTourdes distinguishes four: 1st. _Punctured wounds by cylindrical or\r\nconical instruments_ like a needle. If the instrument be very fine like\r\na fine needle, it penetrates by separating the anatomical elements\r\nof the skin, etc., without leaving a bloody tract. Such wounds are\r\ngenerally inoffensive, even when penetrating, if the needle is aseptic,\r\nand they are difficult to appreciate. On the cadaver it is almost\r\nimpossible to find the tract of such a wound. If the instrument be a\r\nlittle larger it leaves a bloody tract, but it is difficult to follow\r\nthis in soft tissues, more easy in more resistant structures, such as\r\ntendon, aponeurosis, cartilage, or serous membrane.\r\n\r\nIf the instrument be of any size this variety of punctured wounds\r\npresents a form quite different from that of the weapon. Instead of a\r\nround wound it is generally a longitudinal wound with two very acute\r\nangles and two elongated borders of equal length, showing but little\r\nretraction. This is the shape of the wound even when the instrument\r\nproducing it is so large that the resulting wound resembles that made\r\nby a knife (see Fig. 2). The direction of the long axis of these wounds\r\nvaries in different parts of the body and is uniform in the same part.\r\nTheir shape and direction are explained by the tension of the skin or\r\nstill more clearly by the direction of the fibres of the skin, just\r\nas with the same round instrument in a piece of wood a longitudinal\r\nopening or split would be made parallel to the grain (see Fig. 1). In\r\nsome regions, as near the vertebræ, the fibres may run in different\r\ndirections, and the resulting wound is stellate or triangular in shape\r\nas if a many-sided instrument had caused it. As the direction of the\r\nfibres of the various tissue layers, such as aponeuroses, serous and\r\nmucous membranes, etc., may be different, a deep wound involving\r\nseveral such layers would have a different direction for each layer. In\r\nillustration of this, examine the figure of a wound through the wall of\r\nthe stomach (see Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Direction of the Long Axis of Wounds of the\r\nBack caused by Conical Instruments.\r\n(After Langer.)]\r\n\r\nThe wounds above described when large are smaller than the weapon,\r\nas the splitting of the skin has certain limits and also owing to the\r\nelasticity of the skin, which is put on the stretch by the weapon and\r\nrelaxed on its withdrawal. When such wounds are small they are larger\r\nas a rule than the instrument causing them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Slit-like Wound caused by a Pointed Conical\r\nInstrument 2.5 cm. in Diameter. Natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 3.—Wounds of Stomach Wall by a Conical Instrument,\r\nshowing the Different Direction of the Long Axis of the Wounds in\r\nDifferent Layers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—Stab-Wound of the Skin with a Knife a Few\r\nMinutes before Death.]\r\n\r\n2d. _Punctured wounds by instruments both sharp pointed and cutting_,\r\nlike a knife or dagger. If these wounds are perpendicular to the\r\nsurface, they have more or less the form of the weapon used. The angles\r\nmay show whether the knife, etc., had one or two cutting edges, but\r\neven though the back of the knife is broad the wound may resemble\r\none caused by a double-edged weapon. Thus stab-wounds from a common\r\npocket-knife show only exceptionally a wedge-shape, but regularly a\r\nslit, the edges of which are slightly curved to one another and end in\r\ntwo acute angles. The reason of this lies in the fact that the wound is\r\nonly caused by the cutting edge of the knife, so that we cannot tell\r\nas a rule which angle was occupied by the back of such a knife (Figs.\r\n4 and 5). The depth of these wounds may equal the length of the weapon\r\nor be almost any degree less, but the depth may even be greater than\r\nthe length of the weapon by reason of a depression of the parts at\r\nthe time of the blow. The wound is often shorter and broader than the\r\nweapon causing it, though more often it is larger than the weapon from\r\nthe obliquity of the wound and the movement of the weapon on being\r\nwithdrawn. The wound is smaller than the instrument where the parts are\r\non the stretch at the time the wound is inflicted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—Nine Suicidal Stab-Wounds in the Region of the\r\nHeart made by a Knife used for Cutting Rubber.]\r\n\r\nThis variety of punctured wounds may resemble the former class in the\r\ndirection of its long axis, if the cutting edge of the instrument is\r\nblunt. The regularity and smoothness of the edges distinguish them from\r\ncertain contused wounds.\r\n\r\n3d. _Wounds made by instruments with ridges or edges_, files, foils,\r\netc. If the edges are cutting the wound presents more or less the shape\r\nof the weapon (Fig. 6). But this is not always so, probably from the\r\ninstrument puncturing obliquely or from the tissues being unequally\r\nstretched (Fig.7). If the edges are not cutting the wound resembles\r\nthose of the first class, though the edge often presents little tears,\r\nand the wound may thus be more or less elliptical with two unequal\r\nangles. The wound of entrance and exit may be different.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—Stab-Wounds caused by a Three-Sided Sharp-Edged\r\nPointed Instrument.]\r\n\r\n4th. _Irregular perforating instruments_, the wounds from which\r\nresemble contused wounds.\r\n\r\n=Contusions and Contused Wounds.=—A contusion is a wound of living\r\ntissues by a blow of a hard body, not sharp-edged or pointed, or by a\r\nfall, crushing, or compression, and without solution of continuity of\r\nthe skin. A contusion usually involves a moderately large surface in\r\ncomparison to the two other classes of wounds. Contusions are of all\r\ndegrees of severity. If the blow or injury is slight, there is only\r\nslight redness and swelling of the skin with pain, disappearing in a\r\nfew hours, and leaving no traces. If the blow be harder it produces\r\nmore or less crushing of the tissues, accompanied by ecchymosis with\r\nor without a wound or excoriations of the skin, etc. The contusion may\r\nhave the shape of the contusing body, such as a whip, the fingers, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—Stab-Wounds caused by an Eight-Sided\r\nSharp-Edged Instrument. Some show a transition stage to wounds made by\r\na conical instrument.]\r\n\r\n=Ecchymosis.=—This is characteristic, as a rule, of contused wounds.\r\nIt consists in the infiltration of blood into the tissues, especially\r\nthe cellular tissues. The source of the blood is from the rupture\r\nof blood-vessels, and the size of the ecchymosis varies partly with\r\nthe number and size of the blood-vessels, or with the vascularity of\r\nthe part. The size of the ecchymosis also varies with the looseness\r\nof the tissues into which it is infiltrated. This looseness of the\r\ntissues may be natural as in the scrotum and eyelids, or it may be due\r\nto the attrition of the tissues caused by the blow. An ecchymosis is\r\nlarger when the contused parts cover a bony or resisting surface, and\r\nthere may be no ecchymosis whatever, even from a severe blow, where\r\nthe underlying parts are soft and yielding, as is the case with the\r\nabdominal parietes. Here we may have rupture of the viscera without any\r\nsigns of ecchymosis superficially. An ecchymosis may be infiltrative\r\nor it may mostly occupy a cavity usually formed by a traumatic\r\nseparation of the tissues; this is especially the case in the scalp\r\nand extremities when the injury is severe. These tumors, which are\r\ncalled _hematomata_, may be rapidly absorbed or they may remain a long\r\ntime and occasionally suppurate. Sometimes the anatomical conditions,\r\nespecially of the connective-tissue spaces, allow the extension or\r\nmigration of the ecchymosis under the action of gravity, even to a\r\nconsiderable distance. When it meets an obstacle it accumulates above\r\nit, as in the inguinal region for abdominal ecchymosis and at the knee\r\nfor those of the thigh. The course along which the ecchymosis travels\r\nis indicated externally by a yellowish stain, soon disappearing, so\r\nthat soon no sign persists at the site of injury, but only below where\r\nthe blood is arrested.\r\n\r\nAn ecchymosis becomes visible at varying times after the injury\r\naccording to the depth of the ecchymosis and the thinness of the\r\nskin, for the ecchymosis is mostly beneath, not in the skin. If the\r\necchymosis is superficial it shows in one or two hours or even in less\r\ntime where the skin is very thin, as in the eyelids and scrotum. In\r\nsuch cases it increases for thirty or forty hours and disappears in a\r\nweek, but may last longer, _i.e._, as long as fifteen to twenty-five\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAn ecchymosis may not show at the point struck, at least not until\r\nseveral days have elapsed, or it may only show on the under surface\r\nof the subcutaneous fat until it has imbibed its way, as it were, to\r\nthe surface. This may explain the discrepancy in the description of an\r\ninjury examined by two medical experts at different times.\r\n\r\nIf an ecchymosis is extensive and deep, especially if it occupies a\r\ncavity, there may be nothing to see in the skin for four or five days,\r\nand then often only a yellowish discoloration instead of a dark blue\r\ncolor. In such cases, too, the appearance in the skin may be more or\r\nless remote from the injury, having followed the course of the least\r\nanatomical resistance. Between these two extremes, an ecchymosis may\r\nbecome visible at almost any time. Rarely an ecchymosis occurs only\r\ndeeply between muscles (pectorals, etc.) and not superficially at all.\r\n\r\nThe extravasation of blood which forms an ecchymosis has sometimes\r\nbeen given different names, according to its extent or position, for\r\ninstance, parenchymatous or interstitial hemorrhages or apoplexies,\r\nsuffusions, ecchymoses, petechiæ or vibices. All such may, however, be\r\ncalled ecchymoses or hematomata. When blood is effused into the serous\r\ncavities of the body, special names are sometimes applied according to\r\nthe position, such as hemothorax, hematocele, etc.\r\n\r\nThe color of an ecchymosis is at first a blue-black, brown, or livid\r\nred. This color changes first on the edges, later in the darker centre,\r\nand becomes in time violet, greenish, yellow, and then fades entirely.\r\nThis change in color is owing to a gradual decomposition of the\r\nhæmoglobin of the blood. We can tell the age of an ecchymosis from its\r\ncoloration only within rather wide limits, for the rapidity of change\r\nof color varies widely according to a large number of circumstances,\r\nespecially according to whether the ecchymosis is superficial or deep.\r\nWe can only say that the first change, _i.e._, that to violet, in a\r\nsuperficial ecchymosis, occurs in two or three days.\r\n\r\nAs an exception to the above color change, we may mention\r\nsubconjunctival ecchymosis, which always remains a bright red, as the\r\nconjunctiva is so thin and superficial that the coloring matter of the\r\nblood is constantly oxidized.\r\n\r\nThe form of an ecchymosis often reproduces well enough that of the\r\ninstrument, except if the latter be large it cannot all be equally\r\napplied to the surface, and its form is not distinctly shown by that\r\nof the ecchymosis. After its first appearance an ecchymosis spreads\r\nradially, the edges becoming less clear. This change occurs more\r\nrapidly the looser the surrounding tissues, and at the end of a few\r\ndays the first form of an ecchymosis may be changed, so that an\r\nexamination to determine the nature of the weapon should be made as\r\nearly as possible.\r\n\r\nEcchymoses are more easily produced in the young, the aged, and\r\nin females, also in the case of such general diseases as scurvy,\r\npurpura, hemophilia, etc. In fact, in the last three classes they may\r\noccur spontaneously. This fact should never be lost sight of, as the\r\nattempt may be made to explain a traumatic ecchymosis in this way. The\r\ndiagnosis between the traumatic variety and such cases of spontaneous\r\necchymoses is, in general, easy, for in the latter case their number,\r\nform, size, and occurrence on parts little exposed to injury and on the\r\nmucous membranes, as well as the general symptoms of the disease, leave\r\nlittle or no room for doubt.\r\n\r\nFrom an oblique or glancing blow a considerable area of skin may be\r\nstripped up from its deep attachments forming a cavity which may be\r\nfilled by a clear serous fluid alone, or with some admixture of blood.\r\nThese cases have been studied especially by Morel Lavallée and Leser,\r\nand the fluid has been thought to be lymphatic in origin, hence the\r\nname “_lymphorrhagia_.” Carriage accidents, especially where the wheels\r\ndo not pass directly but obliquely across or merely graze the body, are\r\nespecially liable to show this form of extravasation, which is thought\r\nto be more common than is generally supposed, being often obscured by a\r\nsmall quantity of blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—Linear Wound with Nearly Clean-Cut Edges, with\r\nStrands of Tissue bridging across at the Bottom and caused by a Fall on\r\nthe Head on a Smooth Surface.]\r\n\r\n=Contused Wounds.=—If with the contusion we have a solution of\r\ncontinuity of the skin, then we have a contused wound. This may\r\nsometimes resemble an incised wound if the weapon has marked angles or\r\nedges, as a hammer, or, as we have already seen, in wounds of the scalp\r\nor eyebrow (Fig. 8). Careful examination, however, by a small lens if\r\nnecessary, is sufficient to distinguish them if they are fresh. If\r\nthey are four or five days old and have begun to granulate, it may be\r\nimpossible to distinguish them. Contused wounds present on examination\r\nsmall tears on the edges which are widely separated and more or less\r\nextensively ecchymosed. Contused wounds are often irregular, and\r\nhave thickened or swollen and ragged borders. They may, like simple\r\ncontusions, show by their shape the form of the instrument which caused\r\nthem. In contused wounds, unless they be perfectly aseptic, we usually\r\nfind sloughing of the contused, necrotic tissues. This leaves a cavity\r\nto be filled up by granulation like wounds with loss of substance.\r\nThey therefore often present large cicatrices which may be mistaken for\r\nthose of ulcers. In contused wounds the bone may sometimes show the\r\nimpression of the instrument causing the wound.\r\n\r\nA variety of contused wounds is that where the wound of the skin\r\nconsists merely of an _erosion_ or _excoriation_ with an ecchymosis\r\nbeneath. The wound may reproduce the shape of the weapon, _i.e._,\r\nfinger-nails, etc. After death the skin becomes brownish-yellow,\r\nhard, and dry, and then they are called by the French “_plaques\r\nparcheminées_.” They are distinguished, as a rule, from those produced\r\nafter death, by the ecchymosis beneath.\r\n\r\n=Lacerated wounds= resemble contused wounds very closely, but are not\r\necchymosed to any considerable extent. The solution of continuity is\r\nsometimes very extensive and irregular, and may present several flaps.\r\nThe bone or bones are often fractured at the same time. They seldom\r\nbleed much. The course of repair resembles that of contused wounds as\r\na rule. The prognosis is variable, for there may be slow and extensive\r\ncicatrization and impairment of function, etc. These wounds usually\r\nresult from machinery accidents and accidental tears, etc. They are\r\ntherefore seldom the occasion of criminal proceedings but more often of\r\na civil suit, and thus require medical examination.\r\n\r\nThe injury which causes a contusion or contused wound may not\r\ninfrequently produce effects far more serious and more or less\r\nremote from the contusion. Some of these effects it may be well to\r\nparticularize. Blows on the abdomen are sometimes quickly followed by\r\ndeath without visible lesion to account for it. That authentic examples\r\nof this exist has been denied by Lutaud, except for cases of rapid\r\ndeath following contusions of the abdomen which had caused extensive\r\nrupture of the viscera and abundant hemorrhage. But Vibert gives two\r\ncases from his own experience, which are as follows:\r\n\r\nA young man, twenty years old, received a kick in the stomach at a\r\npublic ball. Numerous witnesses of the scene testified that he only\r\nreceived this one blow. The man collapsed immediately and died in a few\r\nminutes. On autopsy nothing was found but two small ecchymotic spots in\r\nthe peritoneum covering the intestine, the largest not the size of a\r\nbean.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, the injury was also a kick in the stomach and the\r\nman died almost immediately. Absolutely no lesion was found on autopsy.\r\nBoth were in full digestion.\r\n\r\nKönig[606] says: “A number of severe contusions of the belly run\r\na rapidly fatal course without the autopsy showing any definite\r\nanatomical lesion of the viscera.” He also adds that the less severe\r\ncases at first often show very profound shock, which is out of\r\nproportion to the force of the injury. The cause of death has been\r\nexplained, like that of sudden death from a blow on the larynx, by the\r\ntheory of inhibition. These cases are often illustrated experimentally\r\non frogs, where the same result is obtained under similar conditions.\r\nSuch cases are the more remarkable from the fact that the fatal blow\r\nmay cause no ecchymosis or other mark of injury to appear on the\r\nabdominal walls.\r\n\r\nBlows on the head may produce a variety of results besides that of\r\nthe contusion itself. In fact, death itself may result though the\r\nmarks of contusion are very slight or even imperceptible. Intracranial\r\nhemorrhage, laceration with ecchymosis of the brain, on the same or\r\nopposite side to the injury, and concussion of the brain may result. Of\r\nthese only concussion will be considered now.\r\n\r\n=Concussion= has been defined as a shock communicated to an organ\r\nby a blow or fall on another part of the body, which may or may not\r\nbe remote, and without producing a material or appreciable lesion.\r\nAccording to Lutaud,[607] English pathologists understand by it a\r\ntemporary or permanent nervous exhaustion resulting from a sudden or\r\nexcessive expense of nervous energy. Its effect is observed in the\r\nfunction of an organ and especially in the brain. Concussion of the\r\nbrain causes stupidity, loss of consciousness, amnesia, coma. The\r\nintracranial lesion most often associated with concussion is ecchymosis\r\nand laceration on the surface of the brain, but there may be no lesion\r\nvisible even if the case is a fatal one. Fatal concussion has been\r\nobserved where the marks of external violence were very slight or even\r\nfailed entirely, as illustrated by the two following cases cited by\r\nVibert:[608]\r\n\r\nVibert made an autopsy on a man who had been struck by a pitchfork,\r\none of the teeth of which struck behind the ear, the other two in the\r\nface, only producing slight skin wounds. The man immediately lost\r\nconsciousness and died in two days in coma. No lesion whatever was\r\nfound within the skull, and only three slight ones externally.\r\n\r\nHe observed another case where the man fell three or four metres\r\ninto an excavation, landing on his feet, and died in a short time.\r\nOn autopsy only slight erosions and no intracranial or extracranial\r\nlesions were found.\r\n\r\nThis case belongs to a rare class where the blow is transmitted through\r\nthe spinal column without sign of injury externally or internally to\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nThe following case cited by Vibert is even more remarkable in the\r\nproduction of the severe though not fatal concussion: An officer\r\nwas riding at full speed on horseback, when his horse suddenly\r\nstopped short. By great exertion the officer clung to the horse, but\r\nimmediately lost consciousness. His fall from the horse was broken by\r\nthose about him, and the concussion he received was not due to the\r\nfall, but to the shock of stopping suddenly when his momentum was great.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, however, the diagnosis of concussion, especially if it is\r\nsevere enough to be fatal, is easily made by the marks of external\r\nviolence with or without intracranial lesions. The effects of\r\nconcussion may be transient and leave no trace, but, on the other\r\nhand, they may be prolonged and severe, _i.e._, paralysis, aphasia,\r\nloss of memory, imbecility, etc. The medical examiner should be on\r\nhis guard against simulation in respect to these prolonged effects of\r\nconcussions. One of the most frequent consequences of concussion is\r\ntemporary amnesia, which ordinarily succeeds immediately after the\r\ninjury, but sometimes develops more slowly. The following curious case\r\nis quoted from Lutaud as cited by Brouardel:\r\n\r\nA woman in getting out of a train at Versailles, where she had gone\r\nto attend the funeral of a relative, was struck by the door of the\r\ncompartment. She fell, but did not lose consciousness, and picked\r\nherself up, but forgot what she had come for.\r\n\r\nAnother result of an injury which has caused a contusion or contused\r\nwound may be a fracture or dislocation. Fractures and dislocations of\r\nspecial parts will be referred to later, in considering injuries of the\r\nseveral regions of the body, but it seems appropriate here to refer to\r\nsome of those general considerations relating to these injuries which\r\nmay especially demand the attention of the medical expert.\r\n\r\n=Fractures= may be produced by blows or falls, or from muscular action.\r\nThe medical witness may be questioned as to the cause of the fracture\r\nor, if it was produced by a blow, whether a weapon was used or not, as\r\nthe defence is likely to assert that it was caused by an accidental\r\nfall. The nature of the associated wounds and contusions, if any exist,\r\nmay, as we have seen, indicate the weapon used. If anything exists to\r\nindicate that a fall which caused the fracture was not accidental, this\r\nshould be noted, as the assailant is responsible for the effects of the\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nA number of conditions influence the ease with which a fracture is\r\nproduced and account for a fracture being due to a slight injury, and\r\nso are mitigatory circumstances in the case.\r\n\r\nFractures are more easily produced in the old and young, especially\r\nthe former, than in the adult from the same force. This is due to\r\nbrittleness of the bones in the old and their small size in the\r\nyoung. Certain diseases like syphilis, arthritis, scurvy, carcinoma,\r\nand rickets make the bones more frangible, and there is a peculiar\r\nbrittle condition of the bones known as _fragilitas ossium_, more or\r\nless hereditary, in which the bones become fractured from very slight\r\nviolence. Mercer is quoted by Taylor as stating, but on how good\r\nauthority it does not appear, that in general paralysis of the insane\r\nthe bones are particularly liable to fracture. Certain it is that not\r\nuncommonly insane patients are found dead with single or multiple\r\nfractures, but the attendants are generally convicted.\r\n\r\nIn some parts, like the orbital plate of the frontal bone, the bone is\r\nvery thin and brittle, but brittleness from any cause only mitigates,\r\nit does not excuse.\r\n\r\nTaylor[609] reports a case in point where it was proved that the bones\r\nof the skull were thin and brittle, and the fractured skull proved\r\nfatal from inflammation of the brain. The punishment was mitigated\r\nowing to the circumstance of the brittleness of the bones.\r\n\r\nSPONTANEOUS FRACTURES may occur from only a moderate degree of muscular\r\naction, and even where there is no disease of the bones, but the\r\nabove-mentioned condition of fragilitas ossium, rendering the bones\r\nmore brittle, aids in the production of such fractures. The olecranon,\r\npatella, and os calcis are particularly liable to such fractures, but\r\nthe long bones of the ribs and extremities are sometimes so fractured,\r\nas instanced in the following cases cited by Taylor:[610]\r\n\r\nThe humerus of a healthy man has been broken by muscular exertion\r\nsimply by throwing a cricket ball.[611] In 1858 a gentleman forty years\r\nold, during the act of bowling at cricket, heard a distinct crack like\r\nthe breaking of a piece of wood. He fell immediately to the ground, and\r\nit was found that his femur was fractured.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1846, a healthy man, æt. 33, was brought to Gray’s Hospital\r\nwith the following history: He was in the act of crossing one leg over\r\nthe other to look at the sole of his foot, when something was heard to\r\ngive way; his right leg hung down and he was found to have received\r\na transverse fracture of the femur at the junction of the middle and\r\nlower thirds.\r\n\r\nThe writer had a case in Bellevue Hospital during the past winter\r\n(1892-93) of a man who stated that he had been well and active until\r\nsome weeks previously, when, from muscular force alone, he sustained a\r\nfracture of the neck of the femur. Something abnormal in the bone may\r\nbe present in such cases.\r\n\r\nIn cases of spontaneous fractures there are no marks of external\r\nviolence which, if present, would remove the idea of spontaneity.\r\n\r\nFractures of the extremities are not dangerous _per se_, unless they\r\nare compound or occur in old, debilitated, or diseased persons, and\r\nthey are more severe the nearer they are to a joint. The healing of\r\nfractures is more rapid in the young than in the old and in the upper\r\nthan in the lower extremity. It is not proven that adiposity of itself\r\nimpedes union.\r\n\r\nThe question may be asked, how long before examination a given bone was\r\nfractured. As a rule, we can only say as to whether the injured person\r\nhas lived a long or short period since the injury, as the process of\r\nrepair varies according to age and constitution. No changes occur until\r\neighteen to twenty-four hours, when lymph is exuded. According to\r\nVillermé the callus is cartilaginous anywhere between the sixteenth\r\nand twenty-fifth days, it becomes ossified between three weeks and\r\nthree months, and it takes six to eight months to become like normal\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nThe question may also be asked: Has a bone ever been fractured?\r\nThe existence and situation of a fracture can often be recognized\r\nlong after the accident, by the callus or slight unevenness due to\r\nprojection of the edges or ends of the fragments. Where the bone lies\r\ndeeply covered by soft parts, it is difficult and often impossible to\r\ntell, long after union has taken place, whether or where a fracture has\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThe answering of this question may sometimes be of importance in\r\nidentifying the dead, especially in the case of skeletons. In the\r\nlatter instance by sawing the bone longitudinally we can tell by the\r\nthickness, irregularity, or structure of the bone tissue whether a\r\nfracture existed, and if it were recent or old at the time of death.\r\n\r\n=Dislocations= call for a medico-legal investigation less often than\r\nfractures. They are less common in the old and where the bones are\r\nbrittle, when fracture occurs more readily. They are seldom fatal _per\r\nse_, unless between the vertebræ or when compound. They may occur from\r\ndisease in the affected joint or even spontaneously. The diagnosis of\r\na dislocation is easy until it has been reduced, and then it may leave\r\nno trace except pain in and limitation of the motion of a joint besides\r\nswelling and ecchymosis. These effects are transient, and after they\r\nhave disappeared it may be impossible to say whether a dislocation has\r\nexisted on a living body, unless, as sometimes occurs, especially in\r\nthe shoulder joint, there may be a temporary or permanent paralysis\r\nof a nerve and muscular atrophy. After death, the existence of an old\r\ndislocation may often be recognized on dissection by scar tissue in and\r\nabout the capsule.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION AND DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nThe examination of wounds or injuries in a case which is or may become\r\nthe subject of a medico-legal investigation should be made with\r\nparticular care and exactness.\r\n\r\nAs the examination of the wounded person is to give most, and in some\r\ncases all, the information to the medical expert on which he is\r\nto base his testimony, it should be made with reference to all the\r\npossibilities of the case.\r\n\r\nThe particular variety of wound as described in the foregoing section\r\nshould be noted, and any peculiarities as to its situation, shape,\r\nextent, length, breadth, depth, direction, and the parts involved.\r\nBesides these points, the condition of the edges of the wound, whether\r\nswollen and ecchymotic, smooth and straight or dentated and irregular,\r\nand whether inverted or everted and gaping, are matters of importance.\r\nThe presence or absence of coagula and clots, the staining of the\r\ntissues with blood, the presence of ecchymosis and its comparative age,\r\nas shown by its color, should also be noted.\r\n\r\nMany of the above points help us in solving another problem, namely,\r\nthe form of the instrument used. This question will be discussed\r\nin a subsequent section, but the basis for our opinion is founded,\r\nof course, on an examination of the particulars of the wound. The\r\nsolution of still another question which often arises and which will\r\nbe discussed in the next section, namely, whether a wound was produced\r\nbefore or after death, is based upon particular features of the wound\r\nsuch as the fluid or clotted condition of the blood on the surface,\r\nor ecchymosed in the tissues, also the amount of the hemorrhage as\r\ncompared to the vascularity of the part as well as the greater or less\r\nstaining of the tissues with blood, and the conditions of the edges,\r\nwhether inverted or everted and whether or not retracted. The question\r\nas to whether a wound was directly, secondary or necessarily the cause\r\nof death, is determined, in part at least, by examination of the wound.\r\nIn this connection we take note as to whether a wound has opened or\r\ndivided a large vein or artery or is situated in such a vascular part\r\nas to be fatal from hemorrhage. We also note whether death could have\r\nbeen due to shock from the situation of the wound, or whether an\r\ninflammation which was directly responsible for death was necessarily\r\ndue to the wound, as in case of a penetrating wound of the viscera,\r\netc. Further, we note whether one of the many forms of wound diseases\r\nfrom infection of the wound has complicated the case and caused death\r\nin the case of a wound not otherwise necessarily fatal. It may be added\r\nthat often the necropsy aids us in the solution of the question as to\r\nwhether the wound was the necessary and direct cause of death, by\r\nshowing a healthy or diseased condition of the viscera.\r\n\r\nThe question as to which of a number of injuries was first inflicted,\r\nalso as to the relative position of the victim and assailant, can be\r\nanswered, if at all, only by an accurate and close examination of the\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\nFinally, the most important question of all, from a medico-legal\r\nstandpoint, namely, the distinction between homicidal, suicidal, and\r\naccidental wounds, is decided or inferred from the characteristics of\r\nthe wound after careful examination.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing questions contribute to the solution of this the\r\nmost important one. The various questions referred to above will be\r\nconsidered at greater length in the subsequent sections. They have been\r\nmerely referred to in brief above, to show the various lines of thought\r\na medical examiner must have in mind in making an examination.\r\n\r\nAs to the act of examination itself, the physician should conduct\r\nit in such a way as not to harm the wounded person. Often simple\r\ninspection is the most that can be done, or the examination may have\r\nto be deferred altogether until the physician in charge informs the\r\ncourt that an examination may be safely made. It is often necessary\r\nfor the expert to get information as to the original lesion from the\r\nphysician in charge. If the wound has been a fatal one and if we are\r\ncalled in after death, we may examine the wound on the dead body with\r\nmuch more freedom. Here we may examine the depth, direction, etc., of a\r\npunctured wound by cutting down on a probe or director. After careful\r\ninspection of the wound we may examine it by palpation, and go on to\r\nthe dissection of the wound and the surrounding parts, tracing and\r\nnoting the various vessels, muscles, etc., involved in the wound, and\r\nlooking for the presence of any foreign body in the wound.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if the cause of death be at all obscure, we should examine\r\nnot only the wound itself and the parts about the wound, but also, by\r\nan autopsy, all the cavities and organs of the body. For death may have\r\nbeen due to natural causes in an organ not examined, if the examination\r\nhas not included all, and the physician has to disprove it.\r\n\r\nIn examining at an autopsy the depth of a wound in reference to the\r\ninstrument which caused it, it should be borne in mind that the wound\r\nmay be deeper than the weapon owing to a depression of the surface by\r\nthe handle of the weapon. This may appear especially marked in the case\r\nof the movable viscera, as at the time of the accident the viscus may\r\nhave been as near as possible to the surface, and at the examination as\r\nfar as possible from the surface, as in the case of a given coil of the\r\nintestines. Also the thorax when opened at autopsy enlarges or expands\r\na little, so that the measured depth of a wound may be greater than the\r\nweapon which caused it. Vibert[612] mentions a case of a penetrating\r\nwound of the thorax involving the heart, where the measured depth of\r\nthe wound was 0ᵐ.035 greater than the length of the instrument. This\r\nmay also be accounted for by a depression or flattening of the thorax\r\nby the blow, as in the case of soft parts. It is often difficult in an\r\nexamination to measure accurately the depth of a wound, for one may\r\nfind it hard to determine the precise end of a wound. Also, for exact\r\nmeasurement it is necessary to have the parts in the same position as\r\nat the time of the accident, and these parts are more or less displaced\r\nby the necessary dissection.\r\n\r\nBesides the examination of the wound there are other points the\r\nexamination of which may aid us in solving the problems presented by a\r\ncase. Among these, the examination of the clothing or dress is perhaps\r\nthe most important. This may indicate the weapon used in an incised or\r\npunctured wound. Contused and lacerated wounds or fractures, etc., may\r\nbe produced without injuring the clothing. Blood, dirt, or grease on\r\nthe clothing may throw light on the case. In self-inflicted wounds the\r\nwound in the clothing and that on the body may not and often do not\r\ncorrespond, as an intending suicide often (a murderer rarely) opens\r\nthe clothing to select the spot for the wound. The wound in the dress\r\nis then added by a second blow not corresponding to the first. In this\r\nway we may sometimes distinguish between a homicidal and suicidal\r\nwound, and thus remove a false suspicion of murder or show that a wound\r\nwas self-inflicted to conceal other crimes or to falsely impute it to\r\nanother. The suspicion of homicide in accidental wounds may be cleared\r\nup by an examination of the dress, as in the following instance related\r\nby Taylor:[613]\r\n\r\nA woman was found dead in bed with two indentations about the middle\r\nof the right parietal bone, a large superficial clot here and three\r\nounces of clotted blood between the dura mater and skull, which latter\r\nwas fractured over an area of four inches. No other cause of death was\r\nfound. The evidence brought out the facts that she had been knocked\r\ndown the evening before, about 7:30 o’clock, by a man accidentally\r\nrunning into her. She fell on the back of the head, was stunned, raised\r\nup, and stimulated; she then walked home, ate her supper, and was\r\nlast seen at 9 o’clock by a fellow-lodger who let her in and noticed\r\nnothing unusual. The next morning she had evidently been dead some\r\ntime. Suspicion fell upon the lodger, who had often quarrelled with\r\nher, and the two claws of a hammer found in his room corresponded more\r\nor less closely with the two indentations found in the skull. At the\r\nadjourned inquest, however, the _bonnet_ worn by the deceased at the\r\ntime of the accident was found to have two indentations on the back of\r\nit corresponding to those on the woman’s skull and containing dust and\r\ndirt, and rendering probable what from the history seemed unlikely,\r\nthat the fall in the road caused the fatal injury. The examination of\r\nthe dress thus avoided an unjust accusation of murder.\r\n\r\nContused and lacerated wounds and fractures or dislocations may be\r\nproduced without injury to the dress, especially if the latter be\r\nelastic or yielding. The comparison of the wound in the clothes with\r\nthat on the body may indicate the position of the body at the time of\r\nthe blow. The examination of the clothes of the injured person may\r\nindicate a struggle which would support the idea of homicide. A blunt\r\ninstrument may indirectly cause an injury by striking something in or\r\non a person’s clothes. Instances have been reported where a wound has\r\nbeen caused by an article in the pocket, or worn outside the clothing,\r\nwithout any trace of an injury to the clothes or pocket lining.[614]\r\n\r\nThe examination of the dress may further show which of several cuts or\r\nstabs was first inflicted. This is shown by the staining of the edges\r\nof the cuts in the clothing, the edges of the first cut or stab showing\r\nno blood-stain or only on the inner surface, as the knife is clean\r\nof blood on entering and all that is removed by the clothing on its\r\nwithdrawal is found on the inner edges. If the edges of the cuts in the\r\nouter layers of clothing are bloody, it is evident that the knife was\r\nalready bloody when used, and the corresponding wound was not the first\r\ninflicted.\r\n\r\nThe imprint of the bloody hand of the assailant may sometimes be found\r\non the clothing of the one injured, and is especially important as\r\nevidence, when the hands of the assaulted are not bloody. In the case\r\nof a severe wound, especially if it is likely to become the object of a\r\ncriminal investigation, the physician should always require to see the\r\ndress of the wounded. The examination of the clothing which the accused\r\nwore at the time the assault took place may give important evidence by\r\nshowing evidences of a struggle or blood-stains. Absence of the latter\r\nwould not prove the innocence of the accused, as the clothes actually\r\nworn may be destroyed and others substituted, or the marks and stains\r\nmay be removed. In the latter case, the eye of a medical man may detect\r\ntraces of blood which otherwise would go unnoticed, and a microscopical\r\nand chemical examination would reveal the real character of the stain.\r\n\r\nBesides the examination of the clothing of the accused, the examination\r\nof his person may furnish evidence of his being engaged in a more or\r\nless desperate struggle by the scratches, marks of nails, contusions,\r\nbites, etc., on the face, neck, front of chest, forearms, and hands.\r\nIf the accused should attempt to explain these wounds and spots, the\r\nlatter may or may not verify the explanation, and thus additional\r\nevidence may be obtained as to the guilt or innocence of the accused.\r\n\r\nIt is well for the medical expert, as well as for others, to collect\r\nthe statements of the wounded person relative to the circumstances of\r\nthe injury. Also, if the accused will vouchsafe any such statements we\r\nmay compare these with one another and with the facts indicated by the\r\nwound, etc.\r\n\r\nOther points to examine, especially in cases of suspected suicide,\r\nmay be briefly mentioned. The presence of the weapon in the hand of\r\nthe victim and firmly grasped in general indicates suicide, if it\r\ncorresponds to the weapon causing the wounds, for otherwise it may\r\nhave been used for defence. If not in the hand, note the spot where\r\nthe weapon was found. In the case of a suicide, the hand as well as\r\nthe weapon held by it is likely to be bloody, also in case of murder\r\nthe generally empty hand is apt to be bloody, as the hand is naturally\r\ncarried to the wound.\r\n\r\nWe cannot further describe the many points which the medical examiner\r\nshould bear in mind in making an examination in a medico-legal case,\r\nwithout repeating too fully what will be given at greater length in\r\nsubsequent sections, reference to which should be made for further\r\nparticulars. Tardieu proposed as a basis for examining and studying\r\nwounds, (1) to visit the wounded person and see what state he is in,\r\nand to determine (2) the nature, (3) the cause, (4) the consequences\r\nof the wound. Also if the wounded person is dead (5) to examine the\r\nbody for the cause of death in order to see if the latter is due to the\r\nwound. Also (6) to determine the circumstances of the affray.\r\n\r\n=The description= of a wound should be given in plain language,\r\navoiding the use of scientific terms or expressions, so as to be\r\nreadily understood by judge and jurors. Otherwise the usefulness of the\r\nmedical expert is very much decreased. The description should also be\r\nprecise and sufficient to justify the conclusions arrived at as to the\r\ncause of a wound, its gravity and results, and the weapon used. With\r\na view to exact statement in description, it is well to take notes as\r\nto the result of the examination and not depend merely on memory. The\r\nobject of the witness should be to be understood and not to be thought\r\nthoroughly scientific.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS THE INJURY INFLICTED BEFORE OR AFTER DEATH?\r\n\r\nThis is a question which may often be asked in cases of fatal injuries,\r\nand it is one which must be answered as definitely as we are able, for\r\nthe defence may rest on the assertion that the wound or injury was post\r\nmortem and not ante mortem. What are the means we have to enable us to\r\nanswer the above question? The most important factor is the condition\r\nof the blood and the changes that it undergoes after death. For some\r\nhours after death the body retains its animal heat. As long as this is\r\nretained rigor mortis does not set in and the blood is more or less\r\nfluid. This period varies, but on the average it does not last longer\r\nthan eight or ten hours. Before this time, however, the blood has begun\r\nto undergo certain changes. These changes result in the inability of\r\nthe blood from a post-mortem wound to coagulate completely. At first\r\nthe greater part may coagulate, but after a time coagulation is less\r\nand less complete, and the coagula are not as firm as those from the\r\nblood of a living person. The period at which these changes occur also\r\nvaries, but they may generally be clearly noticed in from three to four\r\nhours after death, or even sooner. In the first two to four hours after\r\ndeath, therefore, as far as the condition of the blood is concerned, it\r\nmay be difficult or impossible to say whether a wound was made before\r\nor soon after death. In other words, this difficulty exists as long as\r\nthe tissues of the body live after the body as a whole is dead.\r\n\r\nThere are certain general pathological or occasional conditions of the\r\nbody in which the blood during life does not coagulate at all or only\r\nimperfectly, as in scurvy and in the case of the menstrual blood. Also\r\nblood in a serous cavity, especially if it be abundant or there exists\r\ninflammation, is found not to coagulate or only imperfectly. Post\r\nmortem the blood remains liquid long after death in cases of death by\r\ndrowning, asphyxia, etc., and in such cases hemorrhage may be free in a\r\nwound made some time after death. Furthermore, after putrefaction has\r\nset in the blood again becomes more or less liquid, and may flow away\r\nfrom a wound like a hemorrhage, but it no longer coagulates.\r\n\r\nThe principal signs of a wound inflicted during life are (1)\r\nhemorrhage, (2) coagulation of the blood, (3) eversion of the lips of\r\nthe wound, and (4) retraction of its sides.\r\n\r\n1. HEMORRHAGE varies in amount with the size of the wound, the\r\nvascularity of the part, and the number and size of the large vessels\r\ninvolved. In incised or punctured wounds the amount, as a rule, is\r\nquite considerable. If there is a free exit most of the blood runs\r\noff; the rest stays in the wound, where it soon coagulates with the\r\nexceptions mentioned above. But besides partly filling the wound in\r\nthe form of a clot, the edges of the wound are deeply stained with\r\nthe coloring matter of the blood, and this stain cannot be removed by\r\nwashing. This staining involves especially the muscular and cellular\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nFurther, a hemorrhage during life is an active and not a passive one;\r\nthe blood is forced into the interspaces of the tissues in the vicinity\r\nof the wound, and is found infiltrated in the cellular tissue, the\r\nmuscles, the sheaths of the vessels, etc. It is here incorporated,\r\nas it were, with the tissues so that it cannot be washed away. In an\r\nante-mortem wound the arterial nature of the hemorrhage may show by\r\nthe marks of the jets of blood about the wound or on the clothes or\r\nsurrounding objects. When a large vessel has been divided and the\r\nexit for the blood is free, this may run off without infiltrating the\r\ntissues or even staining the edges to any considerable extent, and\r\nthere may remain but little in the wound. In the case of lacerated and\r\ncontused wounds the amount of hemorrhage is less, but rarely fails\r\nentirely, and if the wound is in a vascular part it is liable to cause\r\ndeath from hemorrhage, though a whole limb may possibly be torn off\r\nwithout much hemorrhage. In the latter case, however, there are usually\r\nfound clots of blood adhering to the edges of the lacerated wound\r\nand the ends of the vessels. In contusions where there is no wound\r\nof the skin the blood is prevented from flowing externally, and its\r\naccumulation and distribution form an ecchymosis. Here again we see the\r\nactive power of the hemorrhage which infiltrates between the tissues,\r\nstains them deeply, and appears either as a mere stain or in fine\r\nclots incorporated, as it were, with the tissues or partly occupying a\r\ncavity formed by an extensive displacement of the surrounding parts.\r\nThe amount of blood varies under the same conditions as in incised\r\nwounds, and also according to the greater or less disintegration of\r\nthe tissues by the blow, allowing a larger or smaller central cavity\r\nto be formed. In “bleeders” the amount of the hemorrhage does not\r\nvary under the normal conditions, but a fatal hemorrhage may occur\r\nfrom a very insignificant wound. After hemorrhage from a wound made\r\nduring life the veins are empty about the wound, especially those\r\nsituated centripetally, while normally after death the blood is mostly\r\naggregated in the veins. They are the source of post-mortem hemorrhage,\r\nbut do not empty themselves to any great extent.\r\n\r\nThe _hemorrhage from a wound made after death_ may be extensive if\r\nthe blood remains fluid as in the cases mentioned above, _i.e._,\r\nafter death from drowning or asphyxia or after the commencement of\r\nputrefaction. Otherwise the amount of hemorrhage decreases with the\r\nlength of time after death, until the blood loses its fluidity and\r\nhemorrhage no longer occurs. In general, it is slight unless a large\r\nvein is opened, for the veins are the source of the hemorrhage. There\r\nis usually scarcely any hemorrhage after the first two to four hours.\r\nThis applies also to subcutaneous hemorrhages or ecchymoses. These\r\npost-mortem hemorrhages are passive and not active, consequently there\r\nis less infiltration of blood into the surrounding tissues, which\r\nmerely imbibe it, and the stain is less deep and may be washed off the\r\nedges of the wound, in contrast to the stain of ante-mortem wounds.\r\nAfter putrefaction has set in the hemorrhage may be more abundant,\r\nas the blood is driven to the surface by the formation of gas in the\r\nabdomen and thorax. At the same time, the coloring matter of the blood\r\ntransudes through the walls of the veins and is imbibed by and stains\r\nthe tissues, so that it may be impossible to distinguish it from a true\r\necchymosis. Fortunately these conditions are of small moment, as an\r\nexamination is seldom deferred so long.\r\n\r\nCADAVERIC ECCHYMOSES show almost invariably while the body is still\r\nwarm and the blood more or less liquid, _i.e._, during the first eight\r\nor ten hours after death. They are not due to injury or violence before\r\nor after death, but they may closely resemble ecchymoses produced on\r\nthe living body and be mistaken for them. This is the more important as\r\nthey are quite constant on the cadaver.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, it may be said that an ecchymosis due to a blow\r\nbefore death may not show till after death, as it requires some time\r\nfor a deep ecchymosis or even an ecchymosis covered by a thick layer\r\nof skin to show superficially. Thus a man kicked in the abdomen died\r\nthirty-five hours after the injury from peritonitis, due to a rupture\r\nof the bladder. No ecchymosis appeared at the site of the injuries\r\nuntil after death. It is not uncommon in cases of hanging to observe\r\nan ecchymosis along the course of the cord appearing only after death.\r\nHuize met with a case of this description. Devergie remarked that on\r\nthe bodies of those drowned ecchymoses are often hidden for a time on\r\naccount of the sodden state of the skin, and they appear only after\r\nthe water has evaporated, which may require some days. Furthermore,\r\nit is not necessary to survive long after an injury in order that an\r\necchymosis may show post mortem. If the blood is fluid at the time of\r\nthe blow and any capillaries or larger blood-vessels are torn, then we\r\nmay have an ecchymosis though death be almost instant. Casper thought\r\nthat it required some time before death for an ecchymosis to develop,\r\nand that if the person injured by a contusion died soon after the\r\ninjury, an ecchymosis would not appear after death. There are many\r\nwell-authenticated cases to prove that Casper’s opinion is wrong. Among\r\nthe most famous of these is that of the Duchesse de Praslin.[615] She\r\nwas attacked and killed by her husband while she was asleep in bed.\r\nThe thirty or so wounds showed a mortal conflict, and she could not\r\nhave survived more than one-half hour, and yet after death there were\r\nnumerous ecchymoses from the contusions.\r\n\r\nAnother case is also mentioned by Taylor.[616] A young man died\r\nsuddenly after a blow from a companion, having been struck in the side\r\na fortnight before by a heavy box, which knocked him senseless and\r\nnearly killed him. The post mortem revealed an ecchymosis on the side\r\nwhich on the authority of Casper’s opinion was attributed to the old\r\ninjury. The color of the ecchymosis would be sufficient to settle all\r\nsuch doubts, as the changes of color would have fully developed or the\r\ncolor even disappeared in part in fourteen days’ time.\r\n\r\nAn ecchymosis made post mortem does not undergo the color changes\r\nseen in ecchymoses during life, unless the tissues are œdematous in\r\nwhich the ecchymosis occurs. These changes in color have already been\r\ndescribed, the deep blue changing to violet in eighteen to twenty-four\r\nhours at the earliest. In support of the foregoing and disproving\r\nCasper’s views, Christison found that within two hours after death\r\nsevere blows on a dead body are followed by a livid discoloration,\r\nsimilar to those produced by a blow shortly before death. This livid\r\ndiscoloration is due to the effusion of a very thin layer of blood\r\nexternal or superficial to the true skin, sometimes in a stratum of\r\nthe true skin or more rarely into the cellular tissue, staining deeply\r\nthe partition walls of the fat-cells. Of course, a more or less recent\r\ncontusion or ecchymosis on a dead body was not necessarily produced at\r\nthe same time as the cause of death. It should be borne in mind in\r\nthis connection that ecchymosis is not a necessary result of a blow or\r\ncontusion.\r\n\r\nAccording to Devergie, ecchymosis does not appear when a blow inflicted\r\npost mortem is received by skin directly covering a bony surface\r\nbeneath, and rarely appears where there is a large amount of fat and no\r\nsolid point of resistance beneath the site of the blow.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the fact which Portal long ago remarked,\r\nnamely, that the spleen has been ruptured without ecchymosis or\r\nabrasion of the skin. The same absence of ecchymosis has been noticed\r\nin cases where the liver, stomach, intestines, bladder, etc., have been\r\nruptured as the result of contusing blows.\r\n\r\nThe following case cited by Taylor[617] illustrates this point. Henke\r\nreported the case of a man who died of peritonitis a few hours after\r\nfighting with another man. There was no mark on the skin or ecchymosis,\r\nthough there existed peritonitis from rupture of the small intestine.\r\nThe blow was proven by direct evidence, and though some medical\r\nwitnesses on account of the absence of external signs thought that no\r\nblow could have been struck, others of more experience admitted that it\r\ncould have been the cause of the rupture.\r\n\r\nWatson[618] reports a similar case of a girl nine years old who\r\nreceived a blow from a shoe on the abdomen. This was followed by great\r\npain, collapse and death in twenty-one hours. No marks of injury were\r\nvisible externally, but peritonitis existed from rupture of the ileum.\r\n\r\nA similar case is reported by Williamson,[619] where peritonitis\r\nresulted from complete rupture of the ileum without any trace of injury\r\nexternally, though the blow was struck by the hoof of a horse.\r\n\r\nAnother case was brought into Guy’s Hospital[620] who had been run over\r\nby an omnibus. No injury was discoverable, though the wheel had passed\r\nover the chest and abdomen. He died of peritonitis, however, which set\r\nin on the second day, and on post-mortem examination the liver and\r\nsmall intestines were found ruptured.\r\n\r\nChristison thought as the result of his experiments and experience\r\nthat the most reliable signs of an ecchymosis made during life, and\r\ndistinguishing it from one caused by a blow after death, were as\r\nfollows: The skin of the ecchymosed area is generally much darkened and\r\ndiscolored from blood infiltrated through its entire thickness; the\r\nskin is also much firmer and more elastic from swelling of the part if\r\nthe contusion is received some hours before death. But we may have an\r\neffusion beneath and not in the substance of the skin, and the above\r\nsigns might possibly be due to an injury inflicted only a few minutes\r\nafter death. The above signs may therefore be absent, and when present\r\nare not absolutely indicative of an injury received during life. In\r\ngeneral, the effects of severe contusions inflicted soon after death\r\nmay closely resemble those of slight contusions received during life.\r\n\r\nThere is little danger of contusion if the blow be inflicted on a dead\r\nbody after the loss of body heat and the beginning of rigor mortis.\r\n\r\n2. COAGULATION OF BLOOD.—As stated at the beginning of this section,\r\nblood from a wound inflicted during life coagulates with the exception\r\nof that from those suffering from certain pathological or occasional\r\nconditions or in certain locations, already mentioned. This coagulation\r\nis not immediate, but is complete in about five minutes. The entire\r\namount of blood lost is thus coagulated and the coagula are firm. These\r\ncoagula (if the wound is not interfered with) occur in the opening of a\r\nwound and on its edges, especially at the mouths of the blood-vessels,\r\nwhich are thus plugged. The blood which infiltrates the interspaces of\r\nthe tissues is coagulated in the form of these interspaces. The same is\r\ntrue of the blood of an ecchymosis whether there be a hematoma or only\r\nan infiltration between the tissues, or both. These clots represent\r\nmore or less the form of the space occupied by the blood. In the case\r\nof the scalp a subcutaneous clot may be mistaken for a depressed\r\nfracture of the skull from the fact that the edges of the clot become\r\nvery hard while the centre is still quite soft. A wound in which a\r\nlarge artery has been divided may present very little clotting in the\r\nwound if the opening is free and the blood has mostly escaped in a jet.\r\n\r\nIn a wound produced soon after death there may be some clotting,\r\nbut less in amount, firstly, because there is less hemorrhage, and,\r\nsecondly, because not all the blood clots. These conditions increase\r\nwith the length of time after death, so that after a time a wound made\r\non a cadaver would show very little if any clotting owing to very\r\nslight hemorrhage, and little or no clotting of the blood extravasated.\r\nWhen the body has lost its animal heat and rigor mortis has begun to\r\nset in, then there is no more coagulation of the blood and no more\r\nhemorrhage, under normal conditions, for the blood has mostly become\r\nclotted in the vessels of the body. Consequently, with the exception\r\nof wounds inflicted very soon after death, we can distinguish an\r\nante-mortem from a post-mortem wound by the condition in which the\r\nblood is clotted. If there is any hemorrhage, the wound being inflicted\r\nbefore the loss of animal heat and the blood remains entirely fluid on\r\nthe surface or in an ecchymosis, we know that the wound was produced\r\nafter death and some hours after death unless any of those conditions\r\nexist in which the blood does not normally coagulate. If the hemorrhage\r\nis slight or quite moderate in amount and venous in character, if the\r\nblood is only clotted in part and the clots are rather soft and do\r\nnot form a plug at the mouth of each artery, and especially if the\r\nstaining of the walls of the wound can be washed off, then the wound\r\nwas probably produced post mortem, but not so long after death as in\r\nthe first case supposed. If the characters of the hemorrhage and the\r\nclotting are still more like those normal to a wound inflicted during\r\nlife, then, as a rule, it is impossible to say from these two features\r\nof the wound, hemorrhage and clotting, whether the wound was inflicted\r\nduring life or a very short time after death.\r\n\r\n3. EVERSION OF THE LIPS OF THE WOUND.—The edges or lips of a wound\r\ninflicted during life may be inverted, instead of everted, if a thin\r\nlayer of muscular fibres is attached directly to the deep surface of\r\nthe skin, as is the case in the scrotum. The eversion of the edges of\r\nthe skin is due to their elasticity, and ceases to occur as soon as the\r\nskin loses its vitality. Consequently eversion ceases to occur soon\r\nafter death, within a very few hours. A wound in which the edges are\r\nneither inverted or everted was therefore inflicted after death. If\r\nthis sign is present and marked, the wound was inflicted during life or\r\nwithin two or three hours or less after death. If this sign is present\r\nbut very slightly marked, the wound may have been made even somewhat\r\nlonger after death.\r\n\r\n4. RETRACTION OF THE SIDES OF THE WOUND is also dependent on their\r\nvitality and ceases to occur when this is lost a few hours after death.\r\nIn the retraction of the edges of the wound we have all the parts\r\ninvolved, but unequally. The muscles, arteries, skin, and layers of\r\nconnective tissue all retract, varying in the degree of retraction\r\naccording to the order in which they are named. In different parts\r\nof the body this comparative order of retraction is liable to more\r\nor less variation. Every surgeon is familiar with this retraction\r\nof the tissues, which necessitates certain rules in the technique\r\nof operations, especially of amputations. Muscles retract the more\r\nthe longer they are and the farther the incision is made from their\r\nattachment. Without specifying a definite time, we may say that, as\r\na rule, this retraction lasts no longer than about two hours after\r\ndeath, consequently when it is absent we may infer that the wound was\r\ninflicted two hours or more after death. The amount of retraction grows\r\nless and less after death for about two hours, after which it is very\r\nslight if it occurs at all, owing to the loss of elasticity of the\r\ntissues. This sign is especially useful in the case of a mutilated\r\nbody where, by examining the degree of retraction of the muscles, we\r\nmay infer whether the mutilation was done before or after death. The\r\nsides of a cut made on the cadaver are comparatively smooth and even,\r\nowing to the absence of the unequal retraction of the various elements,\r\nwhich makes the surfaces of a gaping ante-mortem wound uneven and\r\nirregular. Relying on these circumstances in the “affaire Ramus,” cited\r\nby Vibert,[621] one was able to recognize the order in which the body\r\nhad been mutilated.\r\n\r\nOTHER MINOR SIGNS of a wound inflicted during life may be briefly\r\nmentioned. If the edges of the wound are swollen, or show signs of\r\ninflammation or gangrene, or if pus or adhesive material is present on\r\nthe edges of the wound, we may infer that the wound was inflicted some\r\nlittle time before death. Of course, if cicatrization has commenced,\r\nsome days must have elapsed before death after the wound was received.\r\nIf the blow causing a contusion was inflicted some time before death,\r\nthere will be more or less of a general swelling of the region, partly\r\ndue to the blood effused, but also partly due to œdema.\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy to say whether a _fracture_ was produced while\r\nthe body was living or dead. If the body was still warm when a\r\npost-mortem fracture was produced there is little difference from an\r\nante-mortem fracture, except that there may be a little less blood\r\neffused. In a fracture produced after rigor mortis has set in there\r\nis little or no blood effused. In the case of fractures the presence\r\nof callus, indicating the process of repair, shows that the accident\r\noccurred during life, and, as we have already seen, we may form some\r\nidea of the length of time elapsed between the injury and the time of\r\ndeath. On the cadaver it is said to be harder to cause fractures and\r\nlesions of the skin than on the living body. Casper says that fractures\r\nof the hyoid bone and the larynx are impossible after death, and he\r\nalso was not able to rupture the liver or spleen.\r\n\r\nIn distinction to the characteristic signs of a wound inflicted during\r\nlife, we may mention briefly some of the signs of post-mortem wounds\r\nwhen the wound has been inflicted from two to ten or twelve hours or\r\nmore after death:\r\n\r\n(1) The hemorrhage is slight in amount and may fail altogether.\r\n\r\n(2) The character of the hemorrhage is venous, corresponding to the\r\nsource of the hemorrhage from the veins, the arteries being nearly\r\nempty after death.\r\n\r\n(3) The edges of the wound are not deeply stained, and this staining\r\nmay be removed by washing. The spaces between the tissues are not\r\ninfiltrated with blood.\r\n\r\n(4) The blood remains either entirely fluid or, if there are clots,\r\nthese are _softer_ than those in an ante-mortem wound, and only a\r\nportion of the blood is thus clotted. There are no clots plugging the\r\nopen mouths of the arteries on the surface of the wound; the veins may\r\nor may not be closed by an imperfect clot.\r\n\r\n(5) The skin of the edges is not everted or inverted.\r\n\r\n(6) The sides of the wound do not gape and their surfaces are smooth\r\nand even, as the tissues are not unevenly retracted.\r\n\r\nRÉSUMÉ.—It is very easy from the foregoing to distinguish between a\r\nwound inflicted before death and one ten or twelve hours after death.\r\n\r\nIf the hemorrhage has been abundant and arterial, if it has infiltrated\r\nbetween and deeply stained the tissues and the stain cannot readily\r\nbe washed off; if the blood coagulates completely and the coagula\r\nare firm and are found lying in the wound, plugging the vessels, and\r\nincorporated with the tissues between which they lie; if the edges\r\nof the skin are everted and the sides of the wound are retracted and\r\nuneven—under these circumstances, we may be sure that the wound\r\nwas inflicted during life or a very short time after death. If, on\r\nthe contrary, the hemorrhage is slight in amount or almost fails\r\naltogether; if it is venous in character; if the edges of the wound\r\nare only stained by imbibition of the blood, which is not infiltrated\r\nbetween the tissues, and the stain may be washed off; if the blood is\r\nnot at all or only slightly clotted and the clots are soft; if the skin\r\nis not everted and the sides of the wound are smooth and lie nearly in\r\ncontact; if there are no clots plugging the divided arteries on the\r\nsurface—then we need have little hesitancy in saying that the wound\r\nwas produced after death, but probably not later than ten or twelve\r\nhours after death. If the wound was inflicted still longer after death\r\nand before putrefaction, then we would have a lack of the signs due\r\nto hemorrhage, clots, staining, etc. If we find the conditions more\r\nor less midway between the first two, we may be left in some doubt as\r\nto the date of the injury. Thus if the hemorrhage is moderate, the\r\nblood mostly but not altogether clotted and the clots moderately firm,\r\nthe skin slightly everted, and the sides slightly separated and not\r\naltogether smooth on their surface; if the surfaces are fairly deeply\r\nstained and the stain cannot be easily washed off—then we can only\r\nsay that the wound was inflicted during life or within two hours or\r\nso after death, and this fact is often enough for the purposes of the\r\nmedico-legal inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe same is the case with contusions where there is no bleeding\r\nexternally. If we have a bluish, violet, green, or yellow tumor with or\r\nwithout more or less superficial œdema; if this tumor fluctuates or is\r\nhard, but in either case is elastic; if on incision the skin and the\r\ntissue spaces are infiltrated with blood which is coagulated, or if\r\nthere is a cavity filled with clotted blood, the coagulum being firm\r\nand the entire amount of blood coagulated—then the wound was inflicted\r\nduring life. If, however, the surface shows a bluish or violet color,\r\nlittle or no swelling of the skin, which is of natural thickness, and\r\nthe ecchymosed area is not tense and elastic to the touch; if further\r\nthe blood is found on incision to be fluid or if coagulated only partly\r\nso, and the blood is not infiltrated into the tissue spaces, but merely\r\nimbibed by the tissues—then the blow was inflicted after death, and\r\nprobably more than two or three hours after.\r\n\r\nIn contusions especially we may have difficulty, as the sign of\r\nfluidity of the blood may fail and putrefaction may modify the\r\nconditions of the wound unless parts deep beneath the surface be\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that in some cases it is very easy to say that a wound\r\nwas inflicted post mortem. If a wound was not inflicted until ten or\r\ntwelve hours after death or even sooner, we cannot easily mistake it.\r\nBut in many cases it may be hard or impossible to say whether a wound\r\nwas inflicted during life or within an hour or two after death. Here\r\nwe must be cautious in expressing an opinion which should be guarded.\r\nBut we should remember that it is important to be able to state that a\r\nwound was inflicted before or immediately after death, as no one but a\r\nmurderer would think of inflicting a fatal injury on a body immediately\r\nafter death. In such cases a well-guarded medical opinion may often\r\nmeet all the requirements of the case.\r\n\r\nGranted that a given wound was produced before death. There are, then,\r\none or two questions which may arise, and which depend for their\r\nanswer on the length of time the wounded person could have lived and\r\nthe physiological or muscular acts which he could have performed after\r\nreceiving the injury and before death. The first of these questions may\r\nbe expressed as follows:\r\n\r\nCOULD THE VICTIM HAVE PERFORMED CERTAIN ACTS AFTER HAVING RECEIVED HIS\r\nFATAL INJURY? The term “certain acts” here refers to almost any thing\r\nor things which would require time and strength—in other words, the\r\ncontinuance of life with bodily and mental powers for a certain time\r\nafter receiving a mortal injury.\r\n\r\nThis question may be raised in relation to an attempted alibi of the\r\naccused, who may have been proved to be in the presence of the victim\r\na moment before death. If after this moment the victim has moved\r\nfrom the spot or performed certain acts before death, the attempted\r\nalibi may depend upon the answer to the question as to whether the\r\ngiven acts of the victim were compatible with the fatal character of\r\nthe wound. An alibi can aid in the acquittal of the accused only when\r\nthe nature of the injury was such that death would be supposed to be\r\nimmediate or nearly so. Great care should be taken on the part of\r\nthe medical witness in answering this question, for after very grave\r\nwounds, proving speedily fatal, the victim sometimes can do certain\r\nacts requiring more or less prolonged effort, as shown by numerous\r\nexamples. Wounds of the brain are especially noticeable in allowing\r\na survival of several hours, days, or even weeks, during which time\r\nthe injured person may pursue his occupations. Where the survival\r\nhas lasted days or weeks, the alibi has no importance, but not if\r\nthe survival is of shorter duration. The following case is cited by\r\nVibert[1] and may be mentioned in this connection, though the wound\r\nwas caused by a bullet which traversed from behind forward the entire\r\nleft lobe of the brain. After the injury the victim was seen by\r\nseveral witnesses to climb a ladder, though with difficulty, for he\r\nhad right-sided hemiplegia. He was found insensible more than half a\r\nmile away, and did not die until six or eight hours after the injury.\r\nSevere injury of important organs is sometimes not incompatible with\r\nan unexpectedly long survival. Devergie cites two illustrations of\r\nthis which are quoted by Vibert.[622] A man received several extensive\r\nfractures of the skull, with abundant subdural hemorrhage, and rupture\r\nof the diaphragm with hernia of the stomach. The stomach was ruptured,\r\nand nearly a litre of its contents was contained in the left pleural\r\ncavity. Notwithstanding all this, he was able to walk about for an hour\r\nor so and answer several questions. He died only after several hours.\r\nAnother man, crushed by a carriage, received a large rupture of the\r\ndiaphragm, complete rupture of the jejunum, and rupture and crushing of\r\none kidney. Yet he walked nearly five miles, and did not die until the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nMore rarely wounds of the great vessels are not immediately fatal.\r\nM. Tourdes is quoted by Vibert[623] as citing the case of a man who\r\ndescended a flight of stairs and took several steps after division\r\nof the carotid artery; also of one who lived ten minutes after a\r\nbullet-wound of the inferior vena-cava.\r\n\r\nEven wounds of the heart are not as speedily fatal as is commonly\r\nsupposed, and often permit of a comparatively long survival.\r\n\r\nFischer[624] found only 104 cases of immediate death among 452 cases\r\nof wounds of the heart, and healing occurred in 50 cases among 401.\r\nVibert[625] mentions two striking cases of long survival after wounds\r\nof the heart. A woman received a stab-wound which perforated the\r\nright ventricle, causing a wound one centimetre long. She did not die\r\nuntil twelve days later, when on autopsy there was found an enormous\r\nextravasation of blood in the left pleural cavity and pericardium. The\r\nsecond case, though one of bullet-wound, is equally applicable and\r\ninstructive in this connection. A man received a bullet-wound which\r\nperforated the left ventricle, the bullet being found later in the\r\npericardium. After being wounded he threw a lamp at his assassin which\r\nset fire to the room. He then went into the court-yard, drew some\r\nwater, carried it back in a bucket, extinguished the fire, and then lay\r\ndown on his bed and died.\r\n\r\nIn studying the wounds of different regions of the body, we may find\r\nmany other mortal wounds which, though speedily fatal, leave the\r\npossibility of more or less activity before death. We see, therefore,\r\nthat even in those wounds which are commonly supposed to be immediately\r\nfatal, even by many medical men where attention has not been called to\r\nthe exceptions, such exceptional cases are not uncommon in which death\r\nis not immediate. Time and even strength may thus be allowed for more\r\nor less complicated activity. An alibi cannot, therefore, be allowed\r\nwithout question on the part of the medical expert, who must exercise\r\ngreat caution in expressing an opinion. The second question which may\r\nsometimes arise in connection with the last, but having little to do\r\nwith the subject of this section, is the following:\r\n\r\nHOW LONG BEFORE DEATH HAD THE DECEASED ACCOMPLISHED CERTAIN\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ACTS? For instance, how long after a meal did he die?\r\nThis is hard to answer with precision, as digestion varies with the\r\nindividual, and digestion begun during life may go on to a certain\r\nextent after death. We may be able to say if digestion has just\r\ncommenced, is well advanced, or has terminated. What was eaten at the\r\nlast meal may be learned by the naked eye, the microscope, the color of\r\nstomach contents and their odor. The state of the bladder and rectum is\r\nsometimes called in question. All the above facts have less bearing on\r\nthe case than those in relation to the former question.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE OF DEATH FROM WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nThe cause of death should be certain and definite. In reality, there is\r\nonly one real cause, though one or many circumstances may be accessory\r\ncauses. In most cases of death from the class of wounds which we have\r\nbeen considering, there is no difficulty in determining the cause of\r\ndeath so as to be able to state it definitely. But if the deceased had\r\nrecovered from the first effects of the wound and then died, or if\r\ndeath seems as much due to disease as to injury, then the _real_ cause\r\nof death may be obscure. If the medical witness is in doubt as to which\r\nof two causes was the primary cause of death the doubt should be stated\r\nat once, as it may weaken the testimony if brought out later.\r\n\r\nWounds may be directly or indirectly fatal. They are directly fatal if\r\nthe victim dies at once or very soon after the wound, with no other\r\ncause internally in his body or externally from his environment. Wounds\r\nare indirectly or secondarily fatal if the injured person dies from a\r\nwound disease or complication, the direct consequence of the wound,\r\nor from a surgical operation necessary in the treatment of the case.\r\nWounds may also be necessarily fatal either directly or secondarily,\r\nor not necessarily fatal. In the latter case death may be due as\r\nmuch, if not more, to other causes than the wound, and sometimes not\r\nat all to the wound itself. Thus death may be due to natural causes,\r\nlatent disease, an unhealthy state of the body, imprudence or neglect\r\nof treatment, or improper treatment, etc. These various degrees of\r\nresponsibility of a wound as the cause of death we will now consider\r\nmore at length.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. WAS THE WOUND THE CAUSE OF DEATH DIRECTLY?\r\n\r\nIf so, it must have caused death in one of the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. =Hemorrhage.=—This may act by producing syncope. But the amount of\r\nthe hemorrhage may not be sufficient for this result, and still cause\r\ndeath by disturbing the function of the organ into which it is effused,\r\nas in the brain or in the pleural or pericardial cavities. The blood\r\nhere acts mechanically. Blood in the trachea may also kill mechanically\r\nby causing asphyxia.\r\n\r\nThe _amount_ of hemorrhage required to produce syncope varies under a\r\nvariety of circumstances. Less is required in the very young, the aged,\r\nand the diseased, also less in women than in men. Young infants may\r\ndie from hemorrhage from very slight wounds, even from the application\r\nof a leech or the lancing of the gums. A sudden loss of blood is much\r\nmore serious than an equal amount lost slowly. This is the reason that\r\nthe wound of an artery is more serious and more rapidly fatal than\r\na similar loss of blood from other sources. It is hard to specify\r\nthe absolute quantity which must be lost in order to cause death by\r\nsyncope. The total blood in the body is about one-thirteenth of the\r\nweight of the body, making the total amount of blood weigh about twelve\r\npounds. Of this, about one-fourth is in the heart, lungs, and large\r\nblood-vessels. According to Watson, the loss of an amount varying from\r\nfive to eight pounds is enough to be fatal to an adult. But less is\r\nenough to prove fatal in many cases, as the rapidity of the loss of\r\nblood and the age, sex, and bodily condition of the wounded person\r\naffect the amount necessary. Though death from a small artery is\r\nslower than that from a large one, yet it may occur in time, as shown\r\nin the instance quoted by Taylor,[626] where a man bled to death in\r\nthirty-eight hours from the wound of an intercostal artery. Thus, too,\r\na wound of the branches of the external carotid artery is often enough\r\nto cause death, and a wound in a vascular part may cause death from\r\nhemorrhage, though no vessel of any size be divided.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL HEMORRHAGE may be fatal from mechanical interference with the\r\nfunction of an organ, as well as from syncope. Thus we may have death\r\nfrom syncope due to hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity or, after\r\ncontusions, into the intercellular spaces and the cavity due to the\r\nblow, into which several pounds of blood may be extravasated. Internal\r\nhemorrhage is most fatal when due to the rupture of a viscus such as\r\nthe heart, lungs, liver, kidney. Taylor[627] cites a case of a man\r\nrun over and brought to Guy’s Hospital in November, 1864. He had pain\r\nin the back, but there were no symptoms or marks of severe injury. He\r\nleft the hospital and walked home, where he was found dead in bed a few\r\nhours later. His abdomen contained a large amount of blood from the\r\nrupture of a kidney. After severe flagellation blood may be effused in\r\nlarge quantity beneath the skin and between the muscles, which is just\r\nas fatal as if it had flowed externally from a wound. In fact, if the\r\ninjuries are numerous the loss of much less blood is enough to prove\r\nfatal, the element of shock here assisting that of hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n_How are we to ascertain whether a person has died from hemorrhage?_\r\nThis may be more difficult in the case of an open wound, for the body\r\nmay have been moved from the spot where it lay after the wound was\r\nreceived, and the blood on the body, clothes, and surrounding objects\r\nmay have been removed. Then the case may be presumptive only, but we\r\nmay arrive at a definite conclusion by attention to the following\r\npoints: If the wound was in a very vascular part and of some size, or\r\nif a large vessel or many moderately large vessels were divided and\r\nthe vessels, especially the veins in the neighborhood, are empty, then\r\nwe may be quite sure of death from hemorrhage. If there is no disease\r\nfound which could be rapidly fatal the case is still stronger. The body\r\nshould be pallid after fatal hemorrhage, but the same may be the case\r\nfrom death from other causes. In case the body and surrounding objects\r\nhave not been disturbed, then the amount of clotted blood in the wound,\r\non the body and clothes, and about the body, taken in connection with\r\nthe foregoing points, can leave no doubt. We should remember, however,\r\nthat not all the blood about the body was necessarily effused during\r\nlife, but a little hemorrhage may have occurred after death while the\r\nbody was still warm and the blood fluid, _i.e._, during the first four,\r\neight, or ten hours. But the amount thus lost is small. In cases of\r\ndeath from internal hemorrhage we do not have so much difficulty in\r\npronouncing an opinion, as by post-mortem examination we can determine\r\nthe amount of the hemorrhage. We can judge, too, from its position,\r\nwhether it has acted mechanically to interfere with a vital function,\r\nand has thus caused death, or whether the latter was due to syncope\r\nfrom the quantity lost.\r\n\r\n=2. Severe mechanical injury of a vital organ=, such as crushing of\r\nthe heart, lungs, brain, etc. This crushing may be accompanied by\r\nhemorrhage, but death may be more immediate than the hemorrhage would\r\naccount for. The mechanical injury done to the vital centres in the\r\nmedulla by the act of pithing is the direct cause of the sudden death\r\nwhich follows it. Exceptionally slight violence to a vital organ is\r\nfatal, but this may be better explained by attributing it to shock.\r\n\r\n=3. Shock.=—An injury is often apparently not enough to account for\r\nthe fatal result so speedily. The marks of external injury may fail\r\nentirely or be very trifling. Thus more than once persons have died in\r\nrailway collisions with no external marks of violence. So, too, a blow\r\non the upper abdomen, on the “pit of the stomach,” has been rapidly\r\nfatal without any visible injury to the viscera. Death is attributed to\r\nthe effect on the cardiac plexus, and there may be no marks externally\r\nor only very superficial ones. In Reg. _v._ Slane and Others (Durham\r\nWint. Ass., 1872), quoted by Taylor,[628] the deceased was proved to\r\nhave sustained severe injuries to the abdomen by kicks, etc., but there\r\nwere no marks of bruises. All organs were found healthy on post-mortem\r\nexamination, but the injured man died in twenty minutes. Death was\r\nattributed to shock and the prisoners were convicted of murder.\r\n\r\nDeath from concussion of the brain is another example of death from\r\nshock. This may occur with only a bruise on the scalp and with no\r\nintracranial hemorrhage or laceration of the brain. The medical witness\r\nshould be cautious in the above classes of cases in giving evidence, as\r\nthe defence may rely upon the absence of any visible signs of mortal\r\ninjury to prove that no injury was done, a principle fundamentally\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAlso a _number of injuries_, no one of which alone could be the direct\r\ncause of death, may cause death on the spot or very soon afterward.\r\nDeath in such cases, where there is no large effusion under the skin,\r\nis referred to exhaustion, which, however, is merely another term\r\nfor shock. Such cases are exemplified by prize-fighters who, during\r\nor after the fight, become collapsed and die of exhaustion. Having\r\nsustained numerous blows on the body during the many rounds, the body\r\npresents the marks of various bruises, but there may be nothing else\r\nto explain the sudden death. No one injury or bruise is mortal, and\r\nyet, when the deceased was previously sound and in good health, death\r\nmust be referred directly to the multiple injuries received in the\r\nfight. We have already stated above that if the injuries are numerous,\r\nthe loss of a smaller amount of blood may be fatal. We see, therefore,\r\nthat there is not always a specific and visible “mortal” injury to\r\naccount for death. This is a well-known medical fact, but it does not\r\naccord with the erroneous popular prejudice that no one can die from\r\nviolence without some one visible wound which is mortal. In other\r\nwords, the non-professional mind leaves out of account the idea of\r\nshock, only regarding material injury and not functional disturbance.\r\nIf the circumstances accompanying death are unknown, it is well to be\r\ncautious. But if the deceased was in ordinary health and vigor and\r\nthere was no morbid cause to account for the sudden death, we need not\r\nhesitate to refer death to the multiple injuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. WAS THE WOUND THE CAUSE OF DEATH NECESSARILY?\r\n\r\nThis brings up a number of interesting questions to be considered. In\r\nmedical jurisprudence there is probably no condition so common as that\r\nthe injury is admitted, but death is attributed to some other cause.\r\nThus _if there are several wounds_ it may be hard to decide on the\r\nrelative degree of mortality of any particular one, so as to be able to\r\nsay that death was directly or necessarily due to this or that one. The\r\ndefence may plead that death was not necessarily due to the particular\r\nwound attributed to the prisoner. This brings up the question—\r\n\r\n=Which of two or more Wounds was the Cause of Death?= No general\r\nrule can be laid down for all cases, but each case must be judged\r\nby itself. Another way of putting the question is: “_Which of two or\r\nmore wounds was mortal?_” The questions are not quite synonymous, for\r\ntwo or more of the wounds might be “mortal” but not equally the cause\r\nof death. In fact, as we have already seen, no one of the wounds if\r\nthey are multiple may be of itself mortal, but taken together they\r\nare so. Consequently we will suppose that there are but two wounds,\r\nand not multiple ones, and the question remains which of these wounds\r\nwas the cause of death. A wound may be said to be of itself mortal\r\nwhen it is the cause of death directly or indirectly in spite of the\r\nbest medical assistance. In some continental states mortal wounds are\r\ndivided into two classes, those absolutely and those conditionally\r\nmortal, the former including those in which the best medical assistance\r\nis at hand, sent for or timely rendered without everting the result.\r\nThe mortal result in the second class is conditional on want of\r\ntreatment, improper treatment, or accidental circumstances. As Taylor\r\nsays, it is better to look at the effect of the wound and the intent\r\nof the assailant, as is done in English law, rather than at accidental\r\nrelations of the wound.\r\n\r\nTo return to the question, we can readily imagine that a man may\r\nreceive two wounds at different times or from different persons, and\r\ndie after the second wound. Taylor[629] mentions the following case\r\nin which the question arose as to which of two injuries caused death:\r\nIn Reg. _v._ Foreman (C.C.C. February, 1873) the prisoner had struck\r\nthe deceased some severe blows on the head. A fortnight later, having\r\npartially recovered, another man gave him some severe blows on the\r\nhead. A fortnight later still he had left hemiplegia, and died a few\r\ndays later of a large abscess in the brain. The question arose which\r\nset of blows had been the cause of the abscess. The prisoner, the\r\nfirst assailant, was acquitted, as the deceased had had no serious\r\nsymptoms until the second assault, and there was no satisfactory\r\nmedical evidence as to the relation of the two assaults to the abscess\r\nformation. The same author also supposes the following case: A man\r\nhaving received a gunshot wound of the shoulder is doing well, when\r\nin another quarrel he receives a penetrating stab-wound of the thorax\r\nand abdomen. He dies after lingering for a time, under the effects\r\nof these wounds. If the wound of the shoulder could be proven to be\r\nthe cause of death, the second assailant could not be convicted of\r\nmanslaughter, and so too with the first assailant if it could be shown\r\nthat the victim died of the stab-wound. It might be possible for a\r\nsurgeon to decide the question definitely at once if death occurred\r\nsoon after the stab, which was found to have penetrated the heart, a\r\nlarge blood-vessel, or one of the viscera; or, on the other hand, if\r\nthe stab-wound was found to be superficial and not penetrating, and the\r\nwound in the shoulder had suppurated and caused septicæmia.\r\n\r\nIn either or any case, everything would depend upon the evidence\r\nfurnished by the medical witness. His knowledge and judgment are\r\nrequired to distinguish the guilty from the innocent.\r\n\r\nAgain, sometimes death may appear to be equally the result of either\r\nor both wounds, in which case, as far as the medical evidence goes,\r\nboth assailants would be liable to the charge of manslaughter. Or the\r\nsecond wound may be accidental or suicidal, and again the question\r\nwould arise as to the cause of death. A case illustrating this is\r\ntold by Taylor[630] substantially as follows: A grocer’s assistant\r\npursued a thief, who had stolen from a cart, into a coal-shed, where\r\nhe was stabbed twice in the abdomen. The larger wound suppurated,\r\nthe smaller wound healed up, and the man died of peritonitis. On\r\npost-mortem examination the suppurating wound was found not to involve\r\na vital part, while the small healed wound had wounded the liver\r\nand gall bladder and had set up the fatal peritonitis. The large\r\nsuppurating wound had apparently been inflicted purposely; the fatal\r\nwound, directed upward and backward, might have been accidental by the\r\ndeceased rushing upon the knife held more or less in self-defence. The\r\ncase never came to trial, as the assailant was never found, but it can\r\nbe readily imagined what complications might have arisen.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the wounded person may have taken poison or been\r\nsubsequently ill-treated, and he may have died from these causes rather\r\nthan the injury. But the question arises as to whether the wound\r\nwas necessarily the cause of death. Here, in order to exculpate the\r\nassailant, the supervening disease or maltreatment must be such as to\r\naccount for sudden or rapid death under the symptoms which actually\r\npreceded death.\r\n\r\n=Was Death Due to Natural Causes?= Again, the injury may be admitted,\r\nbut it may be claimed that death is due to natural causes. It is not\r\nunusual for wounded persons to die from natural causes, though the\r\ncase may appear otherwise to laymen. This is often seen with suicidal\r\nwounds, especially those inflicted during the delirium of a disease,\r\nor the disease may supervene later and cause death without relation\r\nto the wound. Where the wound was inflicted by another, accurate\r\ndiscrimination is especially important in order to save the accused\r\nfrom imprisonment under false accusation and consequent loss of\r\ncharacter. A careful examination is the only way to determine such\r\ncases, which depend therefore on the medical testimony.\r\n\r\nAgain, the question may arise as between DEATH FROM WOUNDS OR LATENT\r\nDISEASE, the wound perhaps being admitted, but death being attributed\r\nto latent disease. Here a close attention to symptoms and a careful\r\npost-mortem examination can alone decide. A man may die from the\r\nrupture of an aneurism, from an apoplexy or some other morbid condition\r\nafter receiving a severe wound. Or a man with a hernia may receive a\r\nblow upon it causing a rupture of the contained intestine followed by\r\nperitonitis and death, or the recipient of a blow may have a calculus\r\nin the kidney which may perforate a blood-vessel or the kidney tissue\r\nand set up a fatal hemorrhage as the result of a blow.\r\n\r\nThus, medically speaking, the result of the injury is unusual and\r\nunexpected, and due to an abnormal or unhealthy state of body of the\r\nwounded person.\r\n\r\nIf it can be clearly shown by the medical testimony that death was due\r\nto the above or any other latent diseases, the responsibility of the\r\nassailant may be lessened or removed. The law looks to this point and\r\nis lenient in its punishment in the absence of malice on the part of\r\nthe assailant. The crime is still manslaughter and may even be murder\r\nif the assailant was actuated by malice and the abnormal or unhealthy\r\nstate of the body of the victim was taken advantage of. Generally there\r\nis no intention of murder, but the nature of the wound and the means of\r\ninfliction will help to show this, which is for the jury rather than\r\nthe medical witness to decide. There is less ground for mitigation of\r\nthe punishment if the assailant was aware of the peculiar condition of\r\nthe wounded person, especially in the case of those notoriously ill or\r\nof pregnant women.\r\n\r\nClosely allied with this subject are those rare cases where ABNORMAL\r\nANATOMICAL CONDITIONS, such as a thin skull or brittle bones, cause a\r\nslight injury to be followed by unexpected and untoward results, not to\r\nbe looked for in the average individual. In such cases the evidence of\r\nthe abnormal condition furnished by the medical witness may diminish\r\nthe responsibility and mitigate the punishment.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the responsibility of the assailant may not be altogether\r\nremoved, for the question naturally arises, Was death accelerated by\r\nthe wound? This depends upon the circumstances in each case upon which\r\nthe medical witness must base his opinion. Maliciously accelerating\r\nthe death of another is regarded as criminal on the principle that\r\nthat which accelerates causes. The following cases are quoted from\r\nTaylor[631] to illustrate the above distinctions. In Reg. _v._ Timms\r\n(Oxford Lent Ass., 1870) the deceased had been struck on the head by\r\nthe accused with a hatchet, from which injury he had partly recovered\r\nunder treatment in twelve days. But six weeks later he was seized with\r\ninflammation of the brain, with convulsions, and died. At the autopsy\r\ndisease of the kidneys was found, and death was referred to this and\r\nthe inflammation of the brain due to the blows. The prisoner was\r\nconvicted after the judge had charged the jury that it was manslaughter\r\nif they believed that the blows conduced in part to the death of the\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\nIn the following cases there was no connection between the violence\r\nand the cause of death. A man struck his father on the head with a\r\nhammer and was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment, as the injury\r\ndid not appear serious. The father thought the punishment too little,\r\nbecame much excited, and was hemiplegic six days after the wound was\r\ninflicted and died three days later. No injury of the brain was found\r\nunder a fracture of the inner table at the site of the blow, but a\r\nlarge clot was found in the lateral ventricle which, in the opinion of\r\nthe medical witnesses, was not dependent on the blow, and the prisoner\r\nwas acquitted (see Reg. _v._ Saxon, Lancashire Sum. Ass., 1884). Also\r\nin Reg. _v._ Hodgson (Leeds Sum. Ass., 1876) the prisoner had struck\r\nhis wife with a belt, a short time after which she fell back and died\r\nsuddenly. The cause of death was found to be heart disease, and the\r\nblow not being causative in producing the fatal result, the prisoner\r\nwas acquitted. Or again in Reg. _v._ Thompson (Liverpool Sum. Ass.,\r\n1876): The prisoner had stabbed his wife in the cheek. The wound was\r\nsevere but not mortal. Two days later she was delivered of a child\r\nin the infirmary to which she was taken. She died nine days later of\r\npuerperal fever. The prisoner was acquitted on the charge of murder, as\r\nthere was no necessary connection between the wound and the puerperal\r\nfever. Acquittals have taken place in cases of death occasioned by\r\nterror or dread of impending danger produced by acts of violence, as\r\nin the case of Reg. _v._ Heany (Gloucester Lent Ass., 1875). Here\r\nthe prisoner in an altercation with his wife, who was suffering from\r\ncancer, held up a knife in a threatening manner, but did not touch\r\nher. This gave her a shock; she died two days later from fright. As\r\nthere was no distinct proof that death was accelerated by this act,\r\nthe prisoner was acquitted of the charge of murder. Taylor[632] found\r\namong a large number of cases occurring in England during twenty years\r\nthat the latent causes of death, as registered in wounded persons, were\r\nchiefly inflammation of the thoracic or abdominal viscera, apoplexy,\r\ndiseases of the heart and large blood-vessels, phthisis, ruptures of\r\nthe stomach and bowels from disease, internal strangulation, and the\r\nrupture of deep-seated abscesses. Sometimes the person was in good\r\nhealth up to the time of injury, while in other cases there was merely\r\na slight indisposition. It was only by carefulness on the part of the\r\nmedical experts that the true cause of death was ascertained.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be claimed that DEATH was not necessarily the result\r\nof the wound and was AVOIDABLE BY GOOD MEDICAL TREATMENT. There are\r\nmany cases of wounds not mortal with proper and skilled treatment\r\nwhich might become so by improper treatment. They may thus become\r\ndirectly mortal by interfering with a source of hemorrhage which had\r\nbeen arrested, or secondarily mortal by infection of the wound by\r\nmeddlesome treatment. It would depend on the medical witnesses to\r\ndetermine whether and how far the treatment had been responsible for\r\nthe fatal result. If the wound is not of itself mortal and it has\r\nonly become so from improper treatment, this should be a mitigating\r\ncircumstance in favor of the accused. Medically speaking, we can\r\nseldom make the sharp distinction which Lord Hale did legally between\r\na wound becoming mortal from improper treatment and one in which\r\nimproper treatment causes death irrespective of the wound. In case of\r\na slight wound this distinction might be possible, but not so in case\r\nof severe wounds. Also there would probably be no conviction, as far\r\nas the medical evidence is concerned, if the wound was only mortal\r\nin consequence of improper treatment and not mortal as its usual and\r\nprobable result. This may naturally introduce the question of the\r\nCOMPARATIVE SKILL IN TREATMENT. If death is entirely or partly due to\r\na wound the responsibility of an assailant is not altered by unskilful\r\ntreatment. The entire question of the relation of the wound to the\r\nfatal result and the effect on this result of the treatment employed\r\nis left to be determined by the medical experts, and in its solution\r\ngreat care and judgment must be used. Although a given fatal wound\r\nmight not have caused death under the best possible treatment and\r\nsurroundings, yet, according to the above rule, the assailant is held\r\nresponsible as long as the fatal result is due partly, at least, to the\r\nwound. Therefore we see the responsibility of the surgeon not only for\r\nthe life of his patient, but also for that of the prisoner. He should,\r\ntherefore, not deviate from the ordinary and most accepted practice\r\nin such cases, as any such deviation is taken hold of by the counsel\r\nfor the defence. In fact, every point of the treatment is subjected to\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nIn a lacerated wound of the foot, if death occurs from tetanus, it may\r\nbe claimed that death would not have occurred if the foot had been\r\namputated, or, if the foot were amputated and death followed, it may be\r\nclaimed that amputation was unnecessary and was the cause of death. The\r\nsurgeon should, therefore, be able to give the best reasons for every\r\nstep of treatment.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be claimed that DEATH was not a necessary result of the\r\nwound and WAS AVOIDABLE BUT FOR IMPRUDENCE OR NEGLECT on the part of\r\nthe wounded person. A man after being wounded may refuse to receive\r\nmedical assistance, or, after receiving it, may disobey instructions\r\nor refuse to submit to an operation proposed. Thus with a compound\r\ndepressed fracture of the skull the patient may either refuse to see\r\na surgeon, or he may refuse to submit to an operation proposed, or he\r\nmay with or without operation disobey the instructions as to diet and\r\nquiet, and eat or drink heavily and refuse to go to bed. Such a case we\r\ncan readily imagine might die of meningitis, etc.\r\n\r\nIf the symptoms of a wound are unfavorable from the start, or if the\r\nwound of itself is likely to prove mortal, the responsibility of the\r\nassailant is unmitigated by imprudence or neglect of medical assistance\r\nby the wounded person. This is not allowed as mitigatory, as a sane\r\nman is a free agent and is not obliged to call in or submit to medical\r\ntreatment. Moreover, a medical witness in many cases could not swear\r\nthat an operation or other plan of treatment would certainly save life.\r\nThus an amputation of the leg for wound of the foot causing tetanus\r\nis by no means a certain means of cure. But we can readily imagine a\r\ncase where the refusal to submit to the treatment proposed might be\r\nan important element in causing death. Thus in a compound depressed\r\nfracture of the skull with compression, the medical witnesses would\r\nagree that the operation would in all probability save life. This fact\r\nwould probably be only mitigatory in diminishing the penalty, and,\r\nas stated above, would not secure acquittal. But it is none the less\r\nimportant for the medical witness to bear these facts in mind and bring\r\nout the facts and conclusions clearly in his testimony.\r\n\r\nDEATH FOLLOWING SLIGHT PERSONAL INJURIES.—Here again the claim might\r\napparently be justified that death was not necessarily due to the\r\ntrifling injury. And in reality there is commonly some unhealthy state\r\nof the body to explain such an unexpected result. When the disease\r\naccounting for this unhealthy state of the body is in some other part\r\nthan the injury, an examination with ordinary care will explain the\r\ncase. But if the disease and injury are located in the same part,\r\nespecially in the head, the case is more perplexing, but may be cleared\r\nup by careful and thorough examination. Also the usual results of\r\nsuch an injury should be considered, and whether the disease would\r\nbe a usual result of the injury, or whether the sum total of the\r\npathological conditions found would be accounted for by the violence.\r\nIt should be remembered that the presence of chronic disease is no\r\nexcuse. Thus Taylor[633] cites the case of Reg. _v._ Hapley (Lewes Aut.\r\nAss., 1860), where a boy with chronic disease of the brain suffered\r\nfrom no unusual symptom until he received a severe flogging, which was\r\nfollowed by death in less than three hours. The same author mentions\r\nalso the following case to show that fatal results may follow very\r\nslight and trivial blows. Annan[634] tells of a healthy four-year-old\r\ngirl who received a slight blow from the shaft of a wheelbarrow on the\r\nskin about three inches below the knee. There was even no external\r\nmark of violence, and the injury was thought to be so slight as not\r\nto require treatment. There was pain, however, which increased on\r\nthe following day, marked constitutional symptoms appeared, and the\r\nchild died on the fourth day. Even to the punishment inflicted by\r\nschoolmasters death has been imputed.\r\n\r\nWhen DEATH occurs FROM WOUNDS AFTER LONG PERIODS the injury may be\r\nadmitted, but it may be claimed that death was not necessarily due to\r\nthe wound. Medically speaking, death is just as much the result of the\r\ninjury as if it occurred on the spot. Of course, death must be clearly\r\ntraceable to the usual and probable results of the injury, and not be\r\ndependent on any other cause. An examination of the wounded part and\r\nof the whole body will enable the medical witness to determine the\r\ncause of death and whether it is clearly traceable to the injury. A\r\ndoubt on this point may lead to acquittal. Certain forms of wounds\r\nor wounds in certain localities are especially liable to end fatally\r\nafter a long delay, but as the direct result of the wound. These are\r\nwounds of the head and of the spine. As to the first class, the injured\r\nperson may apparently recover and be doing well, when he may suddenly\r\ndie from a cerebral abscess, for instance. This is the result of the\r\ninjury, but remains a longer or shorter time latent. In wounds of the\r\nspine the patient is generally paralyzed below the point of fracture,\r\nbut is apparently in good health. In a longer or shorter time he may\r\ndie of a pneumonia, cystitis, or bedsores, which are the known and\r\nregular consequences of the injury or injured condition. Astley Cooper\r\ncites the case of a man who was injured on the head and died two years\r\nlater from the effects of the injury, as was clearly made out by the\r\ncontinuance of brain symptoms during the entire period. An interval of\r\neleven years occurred in another head injury between the injury and\r\nthe fatal result. The first result of the injury was concussion of the\r\nbrain, and the case is mentioned by Hoffbauer.[635] This long interval\r\nis unusual. There is a rule in English law by which the assailant\r\ncannot be indicted for murder if the victim of the assault lives a\r\nyear and a day. Practically this makes little difference, as nearly\r\nall cases would die within that time; but the principle is wrong as\r\nlooked at from the medical standpoint. The protracted cases concern,\r\nas above stated, mostly injuries of the head, spine, and chest, among\r\nwhich there are some cases, like the examples cited, where, according\r\nto English law, justice would fail to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. WAS A WOUND THE CAUSE OF DEATH SECONDARILY?\r\n\r\nA wound is secondarily the cause of death when the victim, having\r\nrecovered from the first ill effects, dies from some wound disease or\r\naccident or from a surgical operation rendered necessary in the proper\r\ntreatment of the wound. There may be much difficulty in establishing\r\nthe proof of death from a wound by means of secondary causes, for,\r\n1st, the secondary cause must be in the natural course of things; and,\r\n2d, there must be no other accidental circumstances to occasion the\r\nsecondary cause.\r\n\r\nThe secondary cause may be partly due to the constitution of the\r\ndeceased from habits of dissipation, which fact would serve as an\r\nexpiatory circumstance in the case. Among the secondary causes of death\r\nmay be mentioned septicæmia, pyæmia, erysipelas, tetanus, gangrene,\r\nthat is, wound diseases, also the wound accident—as we may call\r\ndelirium tremens, and surgical operations rendered necessary to the\r\ntreatment of the case. We may add, besides the regular wound diseases,\r\ninflammation in and about the wound, septic in character, perhaps not\r\njustifying the title of septicæmia, but which, with its accompanying\r\nfever, may be the “last straw” in a case which might otherwise\r\nrecover. Some of these secondary causes will now be considered more at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nSEPTICÆMIA is a general febrile disease due to the absorption into\r\nthe system from a wound of the products of bacteria or due to the\r\nintroduction into the blood and tissues of the bacteria themselves.\r\nDepending on the two sources of origin, we have two forms of\r\nsepticæmia: 1. Septic intoxication or sapremia, due to the absorption\r\nof a chemical poison, ptomaïnes, and often readily influenced and\r\ncured by the removal of the source of these ptomaïnes in decomposing\r\nblood-clots, secretions, etc. 2. Septic infection comes on less rapidly\r\nbut is more serious than the former is, if properly and quickly\r\ntreated, because the source of the trouble cannot be removed, but is\r\nin the blood and the tissues. The latter form is the more common one\r\nin wounds, though the former may occur in abdominal wounds, especially\r\nwhen a blood-clot is present. The first form begins acutely, the\r\nsecond form more gradually. The infection in septicæmia takes place\r\nthrough a wound and may be due to the weapon which caused the wound,\r\nthe unclean condition of the parts wounded, or to the subsequent\r\ntreatment or want of treatment. It may even take place through the\r\nintestinal mucous membrane as in cases of tyrotoxicon poisoning. It\r\nis most likely to occur during the first four or five days before the\r\nsurfaces of the wound granulate, and it consists in the introduction\r\nof bacteria, especially staphylococci and streptococci. The disease\r\nis characterized by severe constitutional symptoms, acute continuous\r\nfever, inflammation of certain viscera and of the wound, and nervous\r\ndisorders. A pronounced chill ushering in the fever is generally\r\nabsent. Prostration is especially marked, the patient finally passing\r\ninto a typhoid condition indifferent to surroundings. Anorexia and\r\nheadache are usually present; diarrhœa is common, vomiting is not. The\r\nskin is pale and dusky, but not commonly icteric; at first it is hot\r\nand dry, later moist and finally cold and clammy. The spleen is often\r\nenlarged. The pulse becomes weak and rapid and delirium is followed by\r\ncoma. The prognosis is grave. Antiseptic treatment generally prevents\r\nand often cures the disease, as is the case with many other of the\r\nwound diseases; hence the failure to employ it may be alleged by the\r\ndefence in mitigation of the responsibility of the assailant for the\r\nfatal result.\r\n\r\nPYÆMIA is closely allied to septicæmia. It is due to the setting\r\nfree of bacterial emboli or septic emboli from a broken-down, septic\r\nthrombus in the neighborhood of the wound, and the circulation of these\r\nemboli in the blood until they are arrested and form the characteristic\r\nmetastatic abscesses, especially in the lungs, joints, abdominal\r\nviscera, and parotid gland. Almost always the source of infection is an\r\ninfected wound. Granulation does not prevent the occurrence of pyæmia,\r\nwhich, as a rule, commences at a later stage than septicæmia. It is\r\nmost important, however, for our purpose to remember that there is\r\nsuch a thing as spontaneous pyæmia. An injury not causing a wound may\r\nhere be the exciting cause, but the resulting pyæmia is an unexpected\r\nconsequence. A bruise of a bone, for instance, by allowing bacteria,\r\nwhich in certain conditions may be circulating in the blood, to find\r\nan exit from the vessels into the bruised part, may develop an acute\r\nosteo-myelitis, which may be a starting-point of a pyæmia. It is but\r\nproper to state, however, that spontaneous pyæmia is a rare occurrence.\r\nIn fact, it is so rare that if pyæmia occurs and we find ever so\r\ntrifling an infected wound, we can safely attribute the pyæmia to the\r\nwound and not to a spontaneous origin.\r\n\r\nPyæmia begins, as a rule, in the second week of the healing process or\r\neven later. It usually begins with a chill, which may be frequently\r\nrepeated. The fever is very irregular and exacerbations occur with\r\neach metastatic abscess. The skin is icteric, the icterus being\r\nhematogenous. The pulse is rapid and becomes weaker. Infective\r\nendocarditis may develop, which increases the danger of metastatic\r\nabscesses, which may then occur in the brain. Otherwise the mind is\r\nclear and unaffected until the final delirium and coma. The disease may\r\nbecome chronic, but usually lasts a week or ten days. The prognosis is\r\nvery grave.\r\n\r\nERYSIPELAS is a still more frequent complication of medico-legal\r\nwounds, and though not so fatal as the two preceding, it is probably\r\nmore often the secondary cause of death on account of its far greater\r\nfrequence. It too is an acute infective inflammation due to the\r\npresence of a micro-organism, _streptococcus erysipelatis_. This occurs\r\nmostly in the lymphatics of the skin, and effects an entrance through\r\nsome wound or abrasion of the skin or mucous membrane, which may be\r\nalmost microscopic in size. Probably there is no such thing as true\r\n_spontaneous erysipelas_, though the wound may be often overlooked and\r\nonly visible on the closest examination. If a wound has been inflicted,\r\nthe size and severity of it cannot be alleged as a reason why it\r\nwas not the starting-point of an erysipelas. The erysipelas must be\r\nclearly traced to the injury. That is, it must occur before recovery\r\nfrom the wound or not later than a week after it has healed, for the\r\nincubation is probably not longer than this. It is difficult to connect\r\nan erysipelas with a wound if it occurs some time after it has healed\r\nor if it occurs at a different place and not about the wound. Wounds of\r\ncertain regions, as, for instance, scalp wounds, are especially liable\r\nto develop erysipelas, but this is probably owing to the imperfect\r\nantiseptic treatment or delay in applying it. Certain individuals are\r\nmore prone to it than others; thus it has been stated that blondes and\r\nthose suffering from Bright’s disease are more susceptible, though how\r\ntrue this is it is hard to say. It is also probably more prevalent at\r\ncertain times of the year, particularly in the spring. A wound after it\r\nhas scabbed over or has begun to granulate, that is, after the first\r\nfour or five days, is very much less apt to serve as the avenue for\r\ninfection. Erysipelas usually begins with a chill, or a convulsion in\r\nchildren. Nausea and vomiting are the rule. The fever is remittent and\r\nranges from 102° to 104° F., and the temperature may be subnormal when\r\nthe inflammation is subsiding. Prostration is marked and the pulse more\r\nor less weak. There may be delirium while the fever is high. Locally\r\nthere is rarely anything characteristic until twenty-four hours or\r\nso after the chill. Then we have a reddish blush with some tension,\r\nburning and itching of the skin. At first the redness is most marked\r\nabout the wound, later at the edge of the advancing, serpentine margin.\r\nIt spreads widely and rapidly, and after three or four days the part\r\nfirst attacked begins to improve. Desquamation follows. The duration\r\nmay be a week or ten days or as long as a month. The inflammation may\r\nbe much more severe, involving the subcutaneous connective tissue in\r\n_phlegmonous erysipelas_.\r\n\r\nFACIAL ERYSIPELAS is a common variety and was once regarded as\r\nidiopathic, but a wound on the skin or mucous membrane is probably\r\nalways present. The prognosis of erysipelas is usually favorable.\r\nSince the use of antiseptics it is far less common than formerly,\r\nthough still the most common of the infective wound diseases.\r\n\r\nIf a man wounded in an assault is taken to a hospital where erysipelas\r\nprevails, the question of responsibility arises, for, medically\r\nspeaking, he is subjected to great and avoidable risks.\r\n\r\nTETANUS is an infective bacterial disease affecting chiefly the central\r\nnervous system and almost always, if not always, originating from a\r\nwound. Tetanus, like erysipelas, is probably always traumatic and never\r\nstrictly idiopathic. The wound may be so slight as to escape notice.\r\nWhen it follows such injuries as simple fracture internal infection\r\nprobably occurs, though such cases are extremely rare. It is said\r\nthat the weather influences the development of tetanus, and that it\r\nis more common in the tropics. There are also certain sections where\r\ntetanus is much more common than elsewhere and where it may be said to\r\nbe almost endemic. Punctured wounds are most likely to be followed by\r\ntetanus, for they offer the best opportunity for the development of the\r\nbacteria, which are anaërobic. Wounds in dirty parts of the body, like\r\nthe hands and feet, are more apt to be followed by tetanus than those\r\nelsewhere. Tetanus usually appears about the end of the first week\r\nafter a wound has been received, but it may not appear for a longer\r\nperiod, even three or four weeks, so that the wound may have been some\r\ntime healed. To connect tetanus with a particular wound, note (1) if\r\nthere were any symptoms of it before the wound or injury, (2) whether\r\nany other cause intervened after the wound or injury which would be\r\nlikely to produce it, and (3) whether the deceased ever rallied from\r\nthe effects of the injury. Tetanus comes on suddenly without warning.\r\nThe injured person first notices that he cannot fully open the mouth,\r\nhe has lock-jaw, and the back of the neck is stiff. The muscles of the\r\nabdomen and back are next involved so that the back is arched in the\r\nposition known as _opisthotonos_, and the abdomen presents a board-like\r\nhardness. The muscles of the fauces, pharynx, and diaphragm may next\r\nbecome involved, causing difficulty in swallowing and breathing.\r\nThe thighs may or may not be involved, but the arms and legs almost\r\nnever. Owing to the spasm of the abdominal muscles, micturition and\r\ndefecation are difficult and respiration is hindered. The muscles are\r\nin the condition of tonic spasm which permits the patient no rest, the\r\nface bears the “risus sardonicus,” and the suffering is extreme. If\r\nthe patient lives more than two or three days the tonic spasm partly\r\ngives way to increased reflex irritability, in which a noise, jar,\r\nor draught of air may give rise to clonic and tonic spasms in the\r\nmuscles affected. The patient may die at such times from tonic spasm\r\nof the respiratory muscles, or he may die of prostration from want\r\nof food and sleep, worn out by the suffering and muscular spasm. The\r\nmind is usually clear to the last. Fever is not characteristic of the\r\ndisease. Tetanus may be rapidly fatal; in two or three days, or it may\r\nbe or become more chronic. The _prognosis_ of acute tetanus is almost\r\ninvariably fatal; that of chronic tetanus is grave, but a certain\r\nproportion of cases recover.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._—This is easy. It differs from a true neuritis in the\r\nperipheral nerves in that no matter where the wound is situated the\r\nfirst symptom is in the muscles of the jaw and the back of the neck,\r\nand not at the site of the injury and distally from this point.\r\n_Trismus_ is applied to a milder form of the disease in which only\r\nthe face and neck muscles are involved and “lock-jaw” is a prominent\r\nsymptom. Some cases of _tetany_ may be mistaken for so-called\r\nspontaneous tetanus. Tetany may follow child-bed, fevers, mental\r\nshocks, exposure to cold and wet, extirpation of goitre, intestinal\r\nirritation, etc. It consists of painful tonic spasms of the muscles of\r\nthe arms and feet. The attacks last one-half to two hours or more, and\r\nmay be preceded by a dragging pain. They may be brought on by pressure\r\non the nerve leading to the muscles affected. Striking the facial nerve\r\noften causes contraction of the face muscles. There is no trismus but\r\nthere may be opisthotonos. The patient seems well between the attacks\r\nand most cases recover without treatment.\r\n\r\nDELIRIUM TREMENS may occur as a secondary consequence of injuries, or\r\nnecessary surgical operations in the case of those who are habitually\r\nintemperate. Those who habitually use opium, tobacco, cannabis indica,\r\nor even tea or coffee to excess are said to be subject to it. It\r\nmay, therefore, be justly alleged that death is avoidable in very\r\nmany cases, but for an abnormal and unhealthy state of the body.\r\nThe disease is characterized by delirium, a peculiar tremor of the\r\nmuscles, insomnia, and anorexia. Pneumonia may complicate the case.\r\nThe patients die in fatal cases from exhaustion due to insomnia,\r\nlack of nourishment, and their constant activity of body and mind.\r\nThe prognosis is usually favorable, taking all cases together, but\r\nin delirium tremens secondary to surgical injuries or operations the\r\nprognosis is serious.\r\n\r\nDEATH FROM SURGICAL OPERATIONS performed for the treatment of wounds.\r\nThe operation is a part of the treatment, and if it is done with\r\nordinary care and skill the accused is responsible for the result.\r\nThe necessity and mode of operation must be left to the operator’s\r\njudgment. As the defence may turn on the necessity for and the skilful\r\nperformance of the operation, it is well to wait for the advice and\r\nassistance of others if practicable, for death is not unusual from\r\nsevere operations. The patient may die on the operating-table after\r\nlosing little blood, from fear, pain, or shock. Or he may die from\r\nsecondary hemorrhage or any of the secondary causes of death from\r\nwounds enumerated above. The evidence of the necessity of the operation\r\nmust, therefore, be presented by the operator. If an operation is\r\nnecessary and not performed, the defence might allege that death\r\nwas due to the neglect of the surgeon. Another question for the\r\nmedical witnesses to determine is whether the operation was rendered\r\nnecessary because of improper previous treatment, for if it was the\r\nresponsibility of the assailant may be influenced. The meaning of the\r\nterm “necessity” is here a matter of importance. Unless an operation\r\nis necessary to the preservation of life, if death occurs there is\r\nsome doubt whether the assailant is responsible. But, medically\r\nspeaking, we would not hesitate to urge an operation on a wounded man\r\nin order to preserve function, or even to save deformity as well as to\r\nsave life. In the case of operations done under a mistaken opinion,\r\nneither necessary to save life nor, as the result proves, to save\r\nfunction or guard against deformity, if death follows the assailant\r\nmay be relieved from responsibility. Thus an aneurism following an\r\ninjury might be mistaken for an abscess and opened with skill but\r\nwith a fatal result. It is also for the medical experts to determine\r\nwhether an operation was unnecessary or unskilfully performed, for\r\nif it were and death resulted from it, the responsibility of the\r\nprisoner is affected unless the original wound would be likely to be\r\nfatal without operation. According to Lord Hale, if death results from\r\nan unskilful operation and not from the wound, the prisoner is not\r\nresponsible. But yet death may occur as the result of the most skilful\r\noperation necessary to the treatment of a wound, and not be dependent\r\nat all on the wound itself. If the operation is skilfully performed,\r\nand yet the patient dies from secondary causes, such as those above\r\nenumerated or any others, the prisoner is still responsible, and the\r\nmedical testimony is concerned with the performance of the operation\r\nand the secondary causes of death. The relative skill of the operator\r\nor surgeon is probably not a question for the jury in criminal cases,\r\non the ground that the man who inflicts the injury must take all the\r\nconsequences, good or bad. In a civil suit, for instance an action\r\nfor malpractice, the case is otherwise, and all the medical facts and\r\nopinions are submitted to the jury. The law regards three circumstances\r\nin death after surgical operations: (1) The necessity of the operation,\r\n(2) the competence of the operator, and (3) whether the wound would be\r\nfatal without operation.\r\n\r\n_Death_ may occur _from anæsthetics_ used in an operation without any\r\nrecognizable contributing disease of the patient, or carelessness or\r\nlack of skill in the administration of the anæsthetic. Of course, the\r\nquestion of absence of contributing disease on the part of the patient\r\nand of its proper administration must be satisfactorily answered in\r\ncases of death from the anæsthetic in an operation rendered necessary\r\nin the treatment of a wound. Death from an anæsthetic may occur before,\r\nduring, or after an operation itself. Medically speaking, the necessity\r\nof the use of an anæsthetic in operations cannot be questioned, and\r\nin emergencies where an operation becomes necessary, and not a matter\r\nof choice, its use, with special care, is justifiable even with\r\nexisting organic disease, which usually contraindicates it. As death\r\nmay be alleged to be due to the use of a particular anæsthetic, it is\r\nalways best in operating on account of an injury which may require\r\na medico-legal investigation, to use that anæsthetic which is most\r\ngenerally used and indorsed in the particular section of country in\r\nquestion. Of course, it is not lawful to operate against the will\r\nof a person who preserves consciousness and will. It may be added\r\nin this connection that if a medical man be guilty of misconduct,\r\narising either from gross ignorance or criminal inattention, whereby\r\nthe patient dies, he is guilty of manslaughter, according to Lord\r\nEllenborough. Omissions or errors in judgment, to which all are liable,\r\nare not criminal.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. WAS THE WOUND MADE BY THE INSTRUMENT DESCRIBED?\r\n\r\nIt is not often necessary to prove that a weapon was used, though it\r\nmay affect the punishment. For the use of a weapon implies malice and\r\nintention and a greater desire to do injury. The prisoner may swear\r\nthat no weapon was used when the nature of the wound clearly proves\r\nthat one was used. The explanation of the prisoner of the origin of the\r\nwound may thus be discredited. We cannot often swear that a particular\r\nweapon was used, but only that the wound was made by one similar to it\r\nin shape and size. Thus Schwörer tells of the case of a man stabbed in\r\nthe face by another. The medical witness testified that the wound was\r\ncaused by a knife shown at the trial which had a whole blade, but a\r\nyear later the point of the knife which had really caused the wound was\r\ndischarged from an abscess in the cheek at the site of the wound. The\r\nsurgeon thus made a too definite statement in regard to the knife shown.\r\n\r\nIt is often very difficult to answer the above question. We base\r\nour opinion chiefly on two sources: 1st, and most important, by an\r\nexamination of the wound, and, 2d, by an examination of the instrument\r\nsaid to have been used. Certain particulars of the wound may furnish\r\nindications as to the weight, form, and sharpness of the instrument\r\nused. There are certain wounds which must have been made by an\r\ninstrument, namely, incised and punctured wounds. The above question\r\nis determined more or less by what has been said in a former section\r\non wounds, but we will now consider what special features of these and\r\nother classes of wounds indicate the nature, shape, size, etc., of the\r\nweapon used.\r\n\r\n=Incised wounds= must be made by a cutting instrument. We would here\r\nexclude those contused wounds of the scalp and eyebrows which closely\r\nresemble incised wounds, but we have already seen that we can diagnose\r\nbetween these wounds and incised wounds by careful inspection. But the\r\nlocality should put us on our guard, so that in case of wounds of these\r\ntwo regions we should be especially careful in making the examination.\r\n\r\nIn the case of incised wounds we cannot often tell the shape or size of\r\nthe weapon, but we are able to tell certain characteristics about it.\r\n_The sharpness_ of the instrument may be inferred from the clean and\r\nregular edges. The depth of the wound may also indicate the sharpness\r\nof the weapon. A long “tail” in the wound indicates that the weapon was\r\nsharp as well as that this was the part of the wound last made. If the\r\nedges of the wound are rough, we may infer that the edges of the weapon\r\nwere rough and irregular. Wounds caused by bits of china or glass or\r\nfragments of bottles, besides having rough and lacerated edges, are\r\ncharacterized by an irregular or angular course in the skin.\r\n\r\nSome cutting weapons, like an axe, act as much by means of their weight\r\nas by their cutting edges. Wounds caused by such weapons we can often\r\ndistinguish by the following signs: The edges are not as smooth as\r\nis the case with a cutting instrument, and they may be more or less\r\nlacerated and show signs of contusion. The wound is often deep in\r\ncomparison with its length, and the ends of the wound abrupt instead of\r\nslanting up from the bottom to the surface. The section of resisting\r\norgans and the impression of the edge of the weapon on the bone are\r\nfurther signs of the use of such a weapon.\r\n\r\nThe form and direction of a wound may possibly give some indication of\r\nthe form of the instrument—for instance, whether it be straight or\r\ncurved like a pruning-knife, as in the case cited by Vibert[636] of a\r\nwound of the neck which suddenly became deeper toward its extremity and\r\nchanged its direction; the whole being explained on the supposition\r\nthat it was made by a pruning-knife.\r\n\r\nBut it is in =punctured wounds= especially that we are enabled most\r\noften and most accurately to determine the kind of a weapon used.\r\nHere from the form of the wound we may judge of the form and size of\r\nthe weapon. In speaking of punctured wounds in a former section we\r\ndivided them into four groups, reference to which may here be made. In\r\nthe first group, or those caused by cylindrical or conical weapons,\r\nwhen the weapon is very fine it may leave no track at all; if a little\r\nlarger, we may infer from a linear bloody track that the weapon was\r\nneedle-like in shape. The length of the instrument or the depth to\r\nwhich it penetrated may be found, as a rule, only by dissection. If the\r\nweapon were larger and conical, we have seen that the wounds would be\r\nlinear with two angles, the length of the wound being parallel to the\r\ndirection of the fibres in the skin.\r\n\r\nHere we may judge of the form of the weapon from the following\r\ncircumstances: From a comparison of the depth with the size of the\r\nopening, we know that it was a punctured wound. The edges and angles\r\nare not smooth and even enough for a stab-wound with a knife, for the\r\nedges are torn and not cut, and a stab-wound would be the only form of\r\nwound with which we would be likely to confuse it. Furthermore, the\r\ndirection of the long axis of the wound parallel to that of the skin\r\nfibres in the region in which it occurs and the very slight retraction\r\nof the edges distinguish it from a stab-wound. By these signs we can\r\nalmost always distinguish such wounds from stab-wounds, and thus tell\r\nthe form of the weapon used. As to the size of weapon used, these\r\nwounds if of any size are generally smaller than the weapon, for the\r\nskin is put on the stretch by the weapon and yields to a certain\r\nextent. The actual wound, therefore, is smaller in circumference than\r\nthe weapon. The size of the wound is smaller than that part of the\r\nweapon occupying the wound when the weapon was arrested; it may be very\r\nmuch smaller than the weapon at its largest point. Small wounds of this\r\nkind are generally larger than the instrument producing them.\r\n\r\nThe second group of punctured wounds, or _stab-wounds_, are by far the\r\nmost common and, therefore, the most important variety of punctured\r\nwounds. If the _stab-wound_ is _perpendicular_ to the surface the\r\n_form_ of the wound may represent pretty closely that of the weapon at\r\nthe point where the latter was arrested, whether it has a single or\r\ndouble cutting edge. But even here there are exceptions. Frequently a\r\nweapon with a broad back and only one cutting edge may produce a wound\r\nresembling that of an instrument with two cutting edges, the second\r\nangle tearing as in the former class. Here on close examination we can\r\nsometimes distinguish the difference between the two angles, and judge\r\ncorrectly of the shape of the weapon. In fact, wounds made by common\r\npocket-knives are regularly slit-like and not wedge-shaped, as the\r\nwound is caused only by the cutting edge of the knife. Again, if the\r\nsingle cutting edge is blunt, in rare cases the wound is produced in\r\nthe same manner as those of the first group, or conical and cylindrical\r\ninstruments. We would be led to suppose that the wound was produced by\r\nsuch an instrument, as both angles are torn, unless the direction of\r\nthe wound might not follow that of the fibres of the skin, in which\r\ncase we would be left in doubt. Stab-wounds are sometimes angular from\r\nthe knife being withdrawn in a slightly different direction from that\r\nin which it was introduced or from an unequal retraction of the skin\r\n(see Fig. 9). If the _stab-wound_ is _obliquely directed_, we can\r\nstill judge of the general _shape_ of the weapon, with exception of\r\nthe cases above mentioned. The dimensions and size of the weapon are\r\nhere much harder to determine. The _dimensions_ of a stab-wound in the\r\nskin may be the same as those of the weapon, or of that part of the\r\nweapon which is arrested in the wound, but often they are not so. To\r\nmeasure the size of a wound exactly so as to get at the exact size of\r\nthe instrument, we should place the region of the wound in the same\r\nposition, etc., that it was when the wound was inflicted, and this we\r\ncannot often do. As the skin was tense or relaxed at the time the wound\r\nwas inflicted, so the wound in the skin appears smaller or larger, just\r\nas with a sheet of rubber under similar conditions. If the instrument\r\nis very blunt, the wound in the skin may be smaller than the weapon\r\nwhether the skin near the wound is tense or not. Thus Hofmann saw the\r\nwound from a blunt bayonet one centimetre shorter than the weapon.\r\n\r\nThe wound of the skin may be shorter and broader than the weapon\r\nused on account of retraction of the edges of the wound, and this is\r\nespecially marked when the wound lies transversely to the direction of\r\nthe skin fibres. On the other hand, the length of the external wound\r\nis more often greater than that of the weapon, because the wound is\r\nelongated by making pressure toward the cutting edge on withdrawal of\r\nthe weapon, and an oblique wound measures longer than the weapon. If\r\nthe blow is from above downward and the cutting edge of the weapon is\r\nuppermost, the length of the wound is not so likely to be increased\r\nmuch beyond the measurement of the weapon as when the cutting edge is\r\ndirected downward. There is but one condition in which a stab-wound\r\nis at all likely to correspond in dimensions with that of the weapon,\r\nand that is when the wound is perpendicular to the surface. Even here\r\nthe wound may be lengthened on withdrawal of the weapon, and we have\r\nto allow for retraction of the edges and try to put the parts in the\r\nsame condition of tension or laxity as at the time of wounding. Even\r\nin the most favorable case, therefore, we cannot with certainty tell\r\nthe exact size of the weapon. If a stab-wound be directed obliquely to\r\nthe surface, then the length of the wound is greater than that of the\r\nweapon, unless this increase be exactly counterbalanced by the lateral\r\nretraction of the wound. The size of the weapon in such oblique wounds\r\nis further obscured by the changes of size due to withdrawal of the\r\nweapon, retraction of the edges, and the condition of the tension of\r\nthe skin at the time the wound was inflicted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—Angular Stab-Wounds of the Anterior Chest Wall\r\ncaused by a Strong Pocket-Knife.]\r\n\r\nDupuytren remarks that stab-wounds are smaller than the weapon owing\r\nto the elasticity of the skin, but a lateral motion of the weapon may\r\ncause considerable enlargement of the wound. If a stab-wound has\r\ntraversed a part of the body, the wound of exit is smaller than that of\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nThe _depth_ of a punctured wound may be any part of the length of the\r\nweapon, or it may even be deeper than the length of the weapon owing to\r\na depression of the surface by the force of the blow, or the pressure\r\nof the handle of the weapon or the hand holding it. We have already\r\nseen that this may occur in a marked degree in penetrating wounds of\r\nthe abdomen involving one of the movable viscera, also in wounds of\r\nthe thorax, partly from depression of the surface and partly from an\r\nexpansion of the thorax when opened at the autopsy, thus increasing the\r\nmeasured depth of the wound. Punctured wounds of the third class made\r\nby instruments with ridges or edges, like foils, files, etc., present\r\nmore or less the shape of the weapon if the edges are cutting, but\r\nnot always so if the direction of the wound be oblique or the parts\r\nunevenly stretched. If the edges are not cutting they cause wounds more\r\nor less like the first class of punctured wounds, but we can often\r\ndistinguish them from the latter by little tears in the edges. The\r\nentrance and exit wounds may not be alike.\r\n\r\nWounds made by bits of _glass and earthenware_ have irregular and\r\nuneven edges. Taylor[637] relates a case, Reg. _v._ Ankers (Warwick\r\nLent Ass., 1845), where the wound was attributed to a fall on some\r\nbroken crockery, but the wound was cleanly incised and the prisoner\r\nwas convicted. As it may be alleged in defence that a given wound was\r\ncaused by a fall on broken crockery or other substances capable of\r\nproducing a punctured wound, it is important to notice whether the\r\nedges are lacerated and irregular or smooth and clean. The author\r\nquoted above cites another case which occurred to Watson, where the\r\nprisoner alleged that a deep, clean-cut wound of the genitals of a\r\nwoman which had caused her death was due to a fall on some broken\r\nglass. The character of the wound disproved this defence. Another\r\nfeature of such wounds, especially if they be deep in comparison to\r\ntheir length, is that they are very apt to contain small particles of\r\nthe glass or earthenware which caused them. In fact, in all wounds it\r\nis well to search for any small fragments which will throw light upon\r\nthe weapon used.\r\n\r\nWounds caused by _scissors_ are often of characteristic shape. If the\r\nscissors were open we find two symmetrical, punctured diverging wounds,\r\npresenting more or less clearly the form of the blades of the scissors.\r\nIf the blades have been approximated there is a triangular interval\r\nbetween the punctures, the apex of which is truncated if any skin\r\nremains between the punctures.\r\n\r\n_Lacerated wounds_ may not indicate the weapon used as clearly as\r\npunctured wounds, but the agent which produced them is often indicated\r\nby the appearance of the wound. They are generally accidental. But\r\nwhere they occur, as they not infrequently do, on the bodies of\r\nnew-born children, they may give rise to the charge of infanticide.\r\nIn some cases the weapon which caused the wound fits the wound\r\nproduced, and thus important evidence may be furnished the prosecution.\r\nTaylor[638] cites the case of Montgomery (Omagh Sum. Ass., 1873), where\r\na bill-hook which fitted the injuries on the skull of the deceased was\r\nfound buried in a spot to which the prisoner was seen to go. These\r\nfacts connected the prisoner with the weapon and the weapon with the\r\nmurder. In other cases the wounds may be so lacerated or contused that\r\nthe indications of the weapon are obscured.\r\n\r\n=Contusions and Contused Wounds.=—The shape of a contusing body is\r\nsometimes reproduced by the contusion and the ecchymosis. Thus we are\r\nenabled to distinguish the marks of a whip, the fingers, the fist, etc.\r\nThis is best seen when the ecchymosis is fresh, for soon the edges\r\nextend and the outline is less clearly marked. Plaques parcheminées,\r\nwhich we have already described as the marks of contused erosions,\r\nmay show the form of finger-nails, etc. Contused wounds like simple\r\ncontusions may show the shape of the weapon.\r\n\r\nIf the contusing body has a large area, the whole of this area cannot\r\noften strike the body at once, so that the outline of the contusion\r\ndoes not represent that of the weapon. But in general, severe\r\ncontusions present greater difficulties than the preceding classes of\r\nwounds. We must generally be content if we can determine whether the\r\nwound was caused by a weapon, including the fist, or by a fall, and\r\nwe are often unable to say even this. A fall is often alleged by the\r\ndefence as the cause of the injury, but of course if the prisoner\r\nwas responsible for the fall he is responsible for the results of the\r\nfall. If there are contusions or contused wounds on _several parts_\r\nof the head, or if the wounds are on the _vertex_ of the head, it is\r\npresumptive of the use of weapons. We cannot often swear that each\r\nand every wound on the head was due to the use of a weapon. On the\r\nother hand, the presence of grass, sand, gravel, etc., in a wound is\r\npresumptive of a fall and of the origin of the wound in this manner.\r\nIn case of a fall from a height the wound or wounds might be in almost\r\nany part of the body, on the vertex or elsewhere. Such a fall may be\r\nthe result of accident, suicide, or murder. It is not unusual for\r\nfemale complainants to ascribe their wounds to a fall to exculpate\r\nthe prisoner, especially if this happens to be her husband. We should\r\nremember that in the scalp or over the eyebrows a contused wound caused\r\nby a blunt instrument may resemble an incised wound. As already stated,\r\nhowever, if the wound is fresh careful examination will lead to a\r\ncorrect opinion, and the use of a sharp instrument may be disproved.\r\nIf the wound is not recent there is great difficulty in judging of\r\nthe cause. It is well to caution against accepting the interested\r\nstatements of others in regard to the use of a weapon, unless the\r\ncharacter of the wound bears them out very strongly. There may be a bad\r\nmotive for imputing the use of a certain weapon to the assailant. It is\r\nfar better to rely solely upon the evidence furnished by the wound in\r\nsuch cases.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if we could lay down some general rules to\r\ndiscriminate between wounds caused by the blow of a weapon and those\r\ncaused by falls, but this we are unable to do so as to cover all cases.\r\nEach case must be judged by itself.\r\n\r\nIf the question is asked _which of two weapons_ caused certain\r\ncontusions or contused wounds, we are still less likely to be able to\r\nanswer it. In such a case we must make an accurate examination of the\r\nform of the wound and compare it closely with that of the weapon. In\r\nsuch cases also the second source of information on which we base our\r\nopinion as to the relation of a weapon to the wound may be of use,\r\nnamely, the examination of the weapon. The presence of blood, hair,\r\ncotton or woollen fibres on one of two weapons indicates that this was\r\nthe weapon used. The presence of blood is particularly to be looked\r\nfor, and in those parts of the weapon from which it could be washed off\r\nleast easily. We should further note the condition of the point and\r\nedge of the weapon, and if the edge is broken or nicked at all, whether\r\nthis condition is old or recent. The sharpness of the edge should\r\nfurther be noted, and if the edge is sharp note whether it has recently\r\nbeen sharpened. All these points have a certain bearing on the case.\r\nAlso the location, shape, depth, etc., of the wound should be carefully\r\nnoted to see if an accidental fall would be likely to account for it.\r\nFor these features of the wound may be such that no fall could cause it.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that in incised and punctured wounds the use of a\r\nweapon may not be hard to make out, but that in general the question\r\nwhether a particular instrument caused the wound is often difficult or\r\nimpossible to answer. Often the best we can do is to say that the wound\r\ncould have been produced by the weapon.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. WAS A WOUND SELF-INFLICTED OR WAS IT INFLICTED BY ANOTHER?\r\n\r\nIn other words, was it _suicidal_ or _homicidal_? Speaking of suicide\r\nin general, its most common cause is alcoholism. It is not infrequent\r\nin youth. Lutaud[639] states that in fifteen years, presumably in\r\nFrance, there were 1,065 cases of suicide between the ages of ten\r\nand fifteen years. This seems to be only explicable on the ground of\r\nheredity or of cerebral affections. Among 27,737 cases of suicide,\r\nobserved in France, the same author gives the following commonest\r\ncauses in the order of greatest frequence: Drowning, strangulation,\r\npistol-wounds, incised and punctured wounds, poison. The age, sex,\r\nand social conditions influence the choice of means. Thus among males\r\ndrowning is preferred by the young, pistol-wounds by the adult, and\r\nhanging by the aged, while among females asphyxia is the favorite\r\nmethod, as there is no pain and no disfigurement.\r\n\r\nWhile many pathologists consider suicide an act of mental alienation,\r\nand though such may be the case in a large number or even in a\r\nmajority of cases, yet in a considerable number it is a voluntary\r\nand rationally planned act. The question, Is it suicide or homicide?\r\nmay be put in all cases of death by cutting instruments, and in many\r\nfrom other kinds of wounds. It is often, if not generally, impossible\r\nto answer it with absolute certainty. It is hardly suitable for the\r\nmedical witness to try to reconstruct the scene of the crime from the\r\nmedical facts, for he should abstain from everything not medical and\r\nshould distinguish that which is positively proven from that which is\r\nmerely probable.\r\n\r\nSuicides often leave a letter or some such indication to show that the\r\nwound was self-inflicted. If such is not the case, the question as to\r\nthe cause of the wound may or may not be medical. If the question is\r\na medical one, there are certain points to notice as to the wound,\r\nsuch as its _nature_, _situation_, _direction_, and the _number_ and\r\n_extent_ of the wounds, from which we are to form an opinion. There\r\nare also other circumstances which furnish evidence and thus assist us\r\nin answering the question. This evidence is furnished by the weapon,\r\nthe signs of struggle, the examination of the clothes and body of the\r\ndeceased and the accused, the position and attitude of the body, and\r\nany organic lesions, etc., predisposing to suicide.\r\n\r\nThe =nature= of the wound bears upon the question of the homicidal or\r\nsuicidal origin in the following way: Most suicidal wounds are incised\r\nor punctured wounds. _Incised wounds of the throat_ are generally\r\npresumptive of suicide, but a homicidal wound may be inflicted here\r\nto conceal the source of infliction of the wound. Such a wound if\r\nhomicidal would imply malice, on account of the attempt at deception\r\nand concealment, and would convict the assailant of murder. Unless\r\nthe deceased was asleep or drunk or was otherwise incapable of\r\nresistance, such a homicidal wound can often be distinguished from\r\na similar suicidal wound by the form and direction of the wound, by\r\nits irregularity, and by other wounds on the hands or person of the\r\ndeceased. Taylor[640] mentions a case in which the peculiar form of\r\nthe wound, like that made by butchers in killing sheep, led to the\r\nsuspicion that homicide had been committed by a butcher, who was\r\nsubsequently arrested, tried, and convicted of murder. The _regularity_\r\nof the wound has been taken to indicate suicide rather than homicide.\r\nThat it does so is not questioned, but it is more or less fallacious\r\nif resistance is impossible, in which case a murderer may easily make\r\na regular, clean, incised wound here. _Contused wounds_ are seldom\r\nsuicidal, for they are not sufficiently speedily or certainly fatal.\r\nThey are also more painful and disfiguring. Contused wounds usually\r\nindicate murder or accident, though there are not wanting cases of\r\nsuicide by such weapons as a hatchet or a hammer. There is more\r\ndifficulty in the case of a contused wound from a fall instead of from\r\na weapon; for here we have to decide whether the fall was accidental,\r\nsuicidal, or homicidal. The nature of the wound is of little assistance\r\nin the case of insane or delirious patients, who may commit suicide in\r\nthe most unusual and curious manner.\r\n\r\nTaylor[641] relates the case of a delirious patient in Guy’s Hospital,\r\nin 1850, who tore away the whole of the abdominal muscles from the\r\nlower part of the anterior abdominal wall. If the case had not occurred\r\nin the hospital or where there were witnesses of the deed, the nature\r\nof the wound would have indicated homicide except for the delirium.\r\nThe following case, quoted by the same author, illustrates a wound of\r\nvery unusual nature and situation, which might have been taken for\r\na homicidal wound with intent to conceal as far as the situation of\r\nthe wound was concerned. The wound was accidental and occurred in the\r\nfollowing way. A girl fifteen years old jumped on to her uncle’s knee\r\nwhile he was holding a stick between his legs which she did not notice.\r\nThe Stick passed up her anus, but she withdrew it and went on playing,\r\nthough she complained of pain. On the following night acute symptoms\r\nof peritonitis set in, and she died of it in forty-eight hours. On\r\npost-mortem examination a rent was found in the anterior part of the\r\nrectum penetrating the peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\n=The Situation or Position of the Wound.=—A suicidal wound must be in\r\nsuch a position that the deceased could have inflicted it himself. Such\r\nwounds are, therefore, generally anteriorly or laterally situated. The\r\n“site of election” for suicidal wounds is the neck for incised wounds\r\nand the chest, especially in the region of the heart, for punctured\r\nwounds. The situation of suicidal wounds, of lunatics, etc., shows all\r\nkinds of fantasies. The mere situation does not suffice to distinguish\r\nsuicidal wounds, as a murderer may simulate a suicidal wound for\r\npurposes of concealment. Some regard a wound in the back as proof\r\nagainst suicidal origin, but it is not so much the situation of a wound\r\nas the situation taken in connection with the direction which furnishes\r\nthe proof against suicide in such wounds.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, a suicidal wound, besides being in an accessible part of the\r\nbody, is also in a part commonly known to be rapidly mortal, as the\r\nneck and heart. But suicidal wounds are not always in the situation\r\nwhich is anatomically best for being rapidly fatal. Concealed wounds or\r\nwounds in inaccessible parts presumptive of murder may be suicidal and\r\nso placed to impute them to another and give rise to the suspicion of\r\nmurder. The blood-vessels of the arms and legs may be selected as the\r\nsite of a suicidal wound. This situation is often regarded as uncommon,\r\nthough the writer has met with it in one or more cases of attempted\r\nsuicide. It is illustrated in the famous case of Abdul Aziz, the Sultan\r\nof Turkey. He was found dead under suspicious circumstances with two\r\noblique, ragged wounds at the bend of each elbow, directed from above\r\ndownward and from within outward. The joint on the left side was\r\npenetrated, while only the skin and veins were involved on the right\r\nside. Death was due to bleeding from the ulnar artery and the veins.\r\nThe clothing was soaked with blood and scissors stained with blood\r\nwere found on the sofa. These wounds were consistent with suicide,\r\nthough not what would be expected. Nineteen physicians who examined the\r\nbody agreed in reporting it as suicidal, though one reason given for\r\nthis opinion, namely, “that the direction and nature of the wounds,\r\nas well as the instrument which might have effected them, lead to the\r\nconclusion of suicide,” was hardly a valid one, for the wounds were not\r\ntypical of suicide in nature, direction, or position. Such wounds are\r\nrarely homicidal, though at least one such case is mentioned.\r\n\r\nSuicidal incised wounds, as has been said, are usually in the neck,\r\nwhere they may sometimes be arrested by the larynx, especially if it be\r\nossified, though the incision often divides the larynx. The situation\r\nof the wounds is often between the larynx and the hyoid bone, and then\r\nmeeting no bony resistance, they may divide the great vessels and\r\neven nick the vertebræ. But it is rare to be so deep, at least on both\r\nsides at once. As a rule, it is deepest on the side on which it is\r\nbegun and ends more superficially. As far as the situation of a wound\r\nis concerned, there is no wound which a suicide can inflict but what\r\nmay also be inflicted by a murderer. The reverse, however, is not true.\r\nWe cannot always certainly distinguish between suicidal and homicidal\r\nwounds from their situation.\r\n\r\n=The direction of the wound= is one of the most important points to\r\nnotice. It is considered by some to furnish presumptive evidence\r\nfor the medical jurist, and taken in connection with the nature and\r\nsituation of the wound may often lead us to a positive opinion as\r\nto the question of the suicidal or homicidal nature of a wound. The\r\nevidence from the direction of wounds is only furnished by incised and\r\npunctured wounds, rarely by contused wounds. Suicidal incised wounds of\r\nthe throat are almost always directed from above downward and from left\r\nto right if the suicide be right-handed, and in the same direction from\r\nright to left if the person be left-handed. Transverse wounds in this\r\nsituation without obliquity are also compatible with suicide, though\r\nperhaps more common in homicide, while obliquely transverse wounds from\r\nabove downward and from right to left in a right-handed individual are\r\nindicative of their infliction by another. Homicidal incised wounds\r\nof the neck inflicted from behind or the right side, if the victim\r\nand assailant are right-handed, or from the left side if they are\r\nleft-handed, may have the same direction as similar suicidal wounds.\r\nSuch a wound may be inflicted by a murderer to deceive as to the cause\r\nof the wound by raising the suspicion of suicide. If an incised wound\r\nof the throat be inflicted by another from in front, then its direction\r\nis usually the reverse of a similar self-inflicted wound.\r\n\r\nHomicidal incisions, especially in the throat, may extend at one or the\r\nother end beyond the skin wound. In similar suicidal wounds at both\r\nangles of the wound the skin is the first and the last part injured,\r\nand in such wounds the spine is seldom reached. It should be borne\r\nin mind in this connection that a given suicide may be ambidextrous\r\nand this fact may be unknown to the friends of the deceased. This is\r\nespecially the case in the use of the razor from practice in shaving,\r\nand the razor is the usual weapon used in such incised wounds of the\r\nthroat. Neglect of this point may lead to an unwarranted suspicion of\r\nmurder. The two following cases cited by Taylor[642] well illustrate\r\nthis fact:\r\n\r\nIn the case of Sellis,[643] the man was generally supposed to be\r\nright-handed, though he was found dead in bed with his throat cut\r\nand the razor on the left side of the bed. In point of fact, he was\r\nambidextrous in the use of the razor. The second case, which occurred\r\nin London in 1865, was still more remarkable.\r\n\r\nA publican was found dead in bed with his throat cut in a left-handed\r\nmanner. He was supposed to be right-handed and there was bloody water\r\nin a basin in the room. His wife, who gave the alarm, had marks of\r\nbruises on her, and though she said she had found her husband dead in\r\nbed after having left it for a short time, suspicion fell upon her,\r\nespecially as they were in the habit of quarrelling. The suspicions\r\nwere removed, however, by the explanation that he had been brought up\r\nas a wood-carver, which required him to use both hands equally, and\r\nthat he had frequently threatened to kill himself, and further that the\r\nbloody water in the basin was due to a daughter washing her hands after\r\nhaving touched her father. It is even conceivable that an ambidextrous\r\nperson, to avoid suspicion of suicide or to impute murder to another,\r\nmight inflict a suicidal wound from right to left. Notwithstanding all\r\nthis, the above cases are very rare exceptions, and the rules stated\r\nabove as to incised wounds in the throat hold in almost every case.\r\n\r\nIn the case of stab-wounds of the chest, especially in the cardiac\r\nregion, the same rule as to the direction holds good, and in these\r\nwounds we can often define the direction more accurately than in the\r\ncase of incised wounds. If the suicide is right-handed the wound is\r\nregularly on the front or side of the body and directed obliquely from\r\nabove downward and from right to left, while it is from left to right\r\nin case of a left-handed suicide. A murderer from behind, or from that\r\nside the hand of which the victim would use, may inflict a wound in the\r\nsame situation and direction as a suicidal one. Here again this may\r\nbe done with the motive of concealment of the nature of the crime.\r\nHomicidal stab-wounds inflicted from in front, as they generally are,\r\nare usually directed from left to right, and they may be directed from\r\nabove downward or in the opposite direction. Oblique wounds from above\r\ndownward may be either suicidal or homicidal; those directed from below\r\nupward are almost always homicidal.\r\n\r\nWhen a wound is caused by an instrument both cutting and puncturing,\r\nsuicide cannot be admitted unless the direction of the wound is\r\ncompatible with that which the weapon which inflicted the wound, held\r\nin the hand of the deceased, might cause. Taylor recommends to place\r\nthe weapon in the hand of the deceased to see if the direction of the\r\nwound could possibly correspond with that which could be taken by the\r\nweapon in the hand of the deceased with any position possible for\r\nthe arm and hand. Therefore certain wounds by position and direction\r\nexclude suicide, but if a wound is possibly suicidal it is also\r\npossibly homicidal.\r\n\r\nThough suicidal wounds vary, the above points are sometimes of real\r\nassistance in distinguishing between suicide and homicide, especially\r\nif the body has not been moved.\r\n\r\n=Evidence Furnished by the Number and Extent of Wounds.=—Multiplicity\r\nof wounds, as a rule, indicates homicide, and indeed the reverse is\r\ntrue in a majority of cases that a single wound points to suicide.\r\nThere are many exceptions, however, to both statements. Multiple wounds\r\nare possible in suicide, and that, too, with different weapons; even\r\ndrowning or hanging may be resorted to after self-inflicted wounds have\r\nfailed. If several wounds are found, each one of which or more than\r\none of which may be considered grave, it is usual to conclude that\r\nthe wounds were not self-inflicted, but the medical expert should not\r\njudge too hastily from this fact alone, for most wounds do not kill\r\ninstantly. With the presence of several wounds in a case of suicide\r\nonly one of these, as a rule, is “mortal” in character. This being so,\r\nsome have asserted that if two mortal wounds are present, especially if\r\none of them is stupefying, such as a wound about the head, such wounds\r\nare incompatible with suicide. A definite statement of this kind cannot\r\ngo unchallenged unless the two wounds are in different parts of the\r\nbody, and both of such a nature as to be immediately or very rapidly\r\nfatal. For all cases of suicide or homicide do not die immediately\r\nfrom wounds commonly called mortal; in fact, this may be said to be\r\nthe exception rather than the rule. We may safely say, however, that\r\nif there are several distinct wounds on the throat, each involving the\r\nlarge vessels, the inference is plainly murder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—Suicidal Cut Throat from Left to Right,\r\nshowing the Tentative Cuts at the Commencement and the Serrations at\r\nthe Termination of the Wound.]\r\n\r\nSeveral wounds by the same or different weapons cannot, therefore,\r\nbe proof of homicide. The case of a lunatic suicide is reported who\r\ninflicted thirty wounds upon his head. In a case of homicide with\r\nmultiple wounds the situation or direction of some one or more of them\r\nmay give evidence as to the origin of the wounds. Ogston, Sr.,[644]\r\nstates that especially in the case of incised wounds of the throat\r\na suicide may make a number of small or superficial tentative cuts\r\nbesides the principal one, but these incisions are all usually parallel\r\n(see Fig. 10). In the case or multiple homicidal incised wounds of\r\nthe throat, on the other hand, the wounds are not parallel, owing\r\nprobably to the resistance of the victim in this case and his remaining\r\npassive in the former. The extent of the wound refers to the number\r\nand importance of the parts injured. In regard to incised wounds of\r\nthe neck, this point has been thought by some to furnish presumptive\r\nevidence of suicide or homicide—of homicide if the wounds are deep,\r\nof suicide if they are not. While it is true that suicidal wounds of\r\nthe neck are, as a rule, not very deep, and that they seldom reach the\r\nvertebræ and generally do not divide the vessels on more than one side,\r\nyet sometimes such wounds are as deep and extensive as homicidal ones.\r\nThis may imply a determined purpose not to be foiled in the attempt\r\nat suicide. Thus Marc reports a case of suicide by an incised wound\r\nof the neck, where the wound was so deep as to reach the vertebræ or\r\ntheir anterior ligaments and to divide the trachea and œsophagus, both\r\ncarotids and jugular veins. The extent of this wound was greater than\r\nin most suicides, but still we can hardly lay down a hard-and-fast\r\nrule of much practical value according to which extensive wounds are\r\nevidence of murder. Such wounds are, however, presumptive of murder\r\ntaken in connection with other signs pointing that way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Homicidal Cut Throat from Right to Left,\r\nshowing a Tentative Cut at the Commencement and the Serrations at the\r\nTermination of the Wound.]\r\n\r\nThe question may arise in regard to a wound, _whether the victim\r\nwounded himself by precipitating himself on the weapon_. This may be\r\nalleged by the defence, but it is difficult to believe if the wound is\r\ndeep, for the body would naturally repulse the weapon. If the wound is\r\ndeep the weapon must at least have been strongly held, which may or may\r\nnot be consistent with the theory of self-defence. If the direction of\r\nthe wound is oblique from above downward, or if there is one external\r\nwound and two separate tracts internally, from a second use of the\r\nweapon on the part of the person holding it, then the above allegation\r\nis doubtful, if not impossible.\r\n\r\nBy comparing the relative positions of the deceased and accused, as\r\nindicated by the witnesses and accused, with the position and direction\r\nof the wound, we may often judge whether the allegation is possible or\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nBesides the above points derived from the wound itself, there are\r\nseveral other factors which belong to the category of circumstantial\r\nevidence, but which come within the province of the medical expert.\r\nThese latter points of evidence are sometimes almost as important as\r\nthe former, while taken in connection with them they help to make the\r\nevidence far more conclusive.\r\n\r\n=Evidence furnished by the weapon= as to the origin of wounds.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen in a former section that we can often tell, by\r\nvarious signs of the wound, with what kind of a weapon it was made. We\r\nmay thus be able to say that a wound was made by a weapon similar to\r\none exhibited. Also by examination of the weapon itself and from the\r\ncircumstantial evidence of where and how it was found, we may sometimes\r\nsay that the wound was inflicted almost certainly with a particular\r\nweapon. All this evidence may sometimes be made use of in judging\r\nbetween the suicidal and homicidal origin of a wound.\r\n\r\nThe POSITION _of the weapon_ or the place where it is found is a\r\nmatter of considerable importance. If it has not been touched, its\r\nposition should be carefully examined, or inquired about if it has been\r\nmoved. The presence of a weapon which might have caused the wounds\r\nin the hand of the victim is in general proof of suicide. The weapon\r\nmust not merely lie in the hand, it must be gripped by the hand. One\r\nmight suppose that the weapon placed and held in the hand until rigor\r\nmortis sets in would still be firmly held. Casper says that this is\r\nnot so, but that the weapon falls from the grasp as soon as the hand\r\nis unbound. Also Hofmann’s[645] experiments proved the same point. By\r\nthe use of ligatures and several artificial means he tried to confine\r\na weapon in the hand of a recently dead body so that it would be as\r\nfirmly held as by a contraction of the muscles during life. These\r\nexperiments were entirely unsuccessful, for though the fingers remained\r\nclosed, the object was simply held and not grasped, and fell from the\r\nhand on the release of pressure.\r\n\r\nIn suicide the weapon is sometimes held so firmly that force is\r\nrequired to dislodge it. It seems as if the muscular spasm or grip\r\npersists after death, as cadaveric spasm, until rigor mortis occurs\r\nand sets it, as it were. The murderer, therefore, cannot imitate this\r\ngrip, and an unsuccessful attempt to do so would indicate murder. It\r\nshould be borne in mind that the weapon in the hand of the deceased\r\nmay have been for the purposes of defence; therefore it is necessary\r\nto note whether the wounds on the body correspond to those which could\r\nbe made by the weapon. Indeed, this fact is most important to note in\r\nall cases of suspected suicide where the weapon is found. If the weapon\r\nis not in the hand of the deceased, note carefully where it lies. If\r\ndeath is due to a suicidal or accidental wound which is immediately\r\nor very rapidly fatal, the weapon is generally found near the body.\r\nIf so, it is well to note on which side it lies, and if it lies near,\r\nwhether it has apparently fallen or been thrown or placed there. If\r\nthe relation of the body and the weapon has been disturbed by moving\r\neither, the position of the weapon as found by the medical witness is\r\nof little value. In cases of suicide the weapon _may_ possibly be found\r\nat some distance or even concealed, though this is exceptional. Thus\r\nTaylor[646] states that the razor in one instance was found shut at the\r\nside of the deceased, who had committed suicide by cutting his throat.\r\nIn another instance the razor was found in the pocket of the deceased,\r\nbloody and closed. As a rule, the weapon is found lying at the side of\r\na suicide if it is not grasped in the hand. If the weapon is far from\r\nthe body and the wound was quickly fatal, especially if the weapon\r\nis hid or cannot be found, it is strongly presumptive of murder. If\r\nthe weapon is found near the body it is well to note whether the edge\r\nis sharp or blunt, straight or bent, or notched, as these points may\r\nassist us in forming a judgment as to suicide or murder.\r\n\r\nA weapon belonging to the victim may be substituted by the murderer for\r\nthe one really used, and the former may be placed by the side of the\r\nbody. Therefore the weapon found should correspond to the wounds as to\r\nlength, depth, sharpness, etc., to be compatible with suicide.\r\n\r\nGenerally a suicide foiled in the attempt to take his life uses the\r\nsame weapon over again if he persists in the attempt. But he may not do\r\nso; on the contrary, if the first attempt was made with a knife, the\r\nsecond may be made with a pistol, etc. Several wounds by the same or\r\ndifferent weapons cannot therefore be an absolute proof of homicide.\r\n\r\n=The presence of blood, hair, and other substances on the weapon=\r\nused, or probably used, is a matter of some importance. Blood is\r\nnot necessarily found on the weapon used to inflict a mortal wound,\r\nespecially in the case of blunt instruments. In stab-wounds, too,\r\nthe vessels may be compressed by the blow or the weapon may be wiped\r\nas it were on withdrawal by the elasticity of the skin and by the\r\nclothing, except for a thin yellowish film. Thus it is that the first\r\nstab-wound shows no blood on the outside of the clothes but only on\r\nthe inside, but the outside of the second is usually bloody but may\r\nbe but little so. To make sure whether or not there is blood on a\r\nknife or other weapon it is necessary to examine all the depressions\r\non the instrument, as the blade itself may have been washed, and only\r\nthose traces of blood remain which are less accessible to cleaning by\r\nwashing. Blood coagulated on a blade indicates, as a rule, blood from\r\na living animal, but it may not do so. Furthermore, it may be hard to\r\ndistinguish between a thin layer or spots of dried blood not coagulated\r\nor coagulated and dried blood in a similar form.\r\n\r\nIf blood is not found on a weapon, hair and other substances which\r\ncan be identified may be. This is especially the case with blunt\r\nweapons, on which, as we have seen, blood usually fails. A fragment of\r\nthe weapon may break off in the wound, as in stab-wounds, and may be\r\nidentified as belonging to one in the murderer’s possession.\r\n\r\n=The signs of a struggle= furnish important evidence, as they are\r\nnot likely to be found in the case of suicide. If the wounds were\r\ninflicted by a cutting instrument, the existence of a struggle may be\r\nindicated by incisions on the palm of the hand or fingers or on the\r\ndorsum (see Fig 12). Such wounds would not be self-inflicted and would\r\nindicate a struggle with the murderer. Or if contusions or ecchymoses\r\nindicating the form of the foot, fist, fingers, or finger-nails are\r\nfound on the face, neck, chest, forearm, or hand of the deceased, this\r\nagain indicates a struggle with the assailant, and goes far to prove\r\nmurder. The same is true of the imprint of a bloody or dirty hand on\r\nthe clothes of the victim when the victim’s hands were not bloody. Also\r\nsuch an imprint in a position where the deceased could not have reached\r\nwith the particular hand indicated, as is the case if the impression\r\nof a right hand be found on the victim’s right arm; this indicates a\r\nstruggle with a murderer, etc. In one case of murder, on the back of\r\nthe left hand of the deceased there was found the bloody mark of a left\r\nhand evidently not that of the victim himself. The presence of marks of\r\nviolence about the mouth of the deceased, done to close it to prevent\r\nthe victim from giving an alarm, especially if surprised during sleep,\r\nis presumptive of murder. Sometimes hair or fragments of clothing\r\nbelonging to the accused are found in the grasp of the deceased,\r\nindicating a desperate struggle, and they are very suspicious of\r\nmurder. Thus Taylor[647] cites the case of a murder trial in Ireland,\r\nin 1877, where hairs found firmly grasped in the hands of the deceased\r\nwere found to correspond to the hair of the accused. The clothes of the\r\ndeceased, as well as those of the accused, often indicate a struggle\r\nunless the accused can satisfactorily account for the condition of his\r\nown clothes in some other way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—Incised Wounds of Right Hand in the Struggle\r\nof Defence. Homicide.]\r\n\r\n=The examination of the clothes and body= of the deceased and the\r\naccused may furnish important evidence.\r\n\r\nIf suicide is accomplished by a weapon like a knife, it is rare for the\r\nhand not to be bloody. If it is not bloody we may well suspect a case\r\nof supposed suicide. The presence of blood on the hand does not prove\r\nsuicide, though its absence may disprove it, as the hand is generally\r\nbloody in case of murder by being carried to the wound.\r\n\r\nThe _examination of the clothing of the deceased_ is of great\r\nimportance. As we have noticed before, a suicide generally opens them,\r\na murderer rarely. A suicide is often partly or even wholly undressed\r\nwhen he inflicts the wound, while murder is usually committed on those\r\nentirely dressed. The wound of the clothes should correspond to that of\r\nthe body in case of murder. In suicide the wounds of the body and of\r\nthe clothes may not correspond, especially if there exists a motive to\r\nfalsely impute the crime. The clothes of the deceased as well as those\r\nof the accused may indicate a struggle, as we have already noticed. Of\r\ncourse, in regard to the clothes examined, it is necessary to clearly\r\nprove that they were worn at the time by the deceased or accused,\r\notherwise serious mistakes may be and sometimes are made. In examining\r\nthe blood-spots on the clothing, note whether the blood occurs in large\r\npatches or sprinkled as by a spurting vessel or by continued violence.\r\n\r\nThe _body of the accused_ may present scratches, marks of nails,\r\ncontusions, bites, or other wounds indicative of a struggle. It would\r\nbe well to ask the accused how he received the wounds or scars, to see\r\nif his explanations tally with the injuries. It is hard to tell when\r\nwounds which have cicatrized were inflicted; we can only distinguish\r\nbetween old and recent ones, and thus control the statements of the\r\naccused. An examination of the finger-nails of the prisoner soon\r\nafter the crime may reveal blood underneath when the rest of the\r\nhands and person are free from it. Note also the site and shape of\r\nthe blood-spots, if they exist, and whether or not they came from an\r\narterial jet. These spots may be on the body or clothes of the accused.\r\nThe account of the accused as to these spots may or may not correspond\r\nto the facts as indicated by them. The above leads us to the more or\r\nless important question:\r\n\r\n\r\nCOULD THE ASSAILANT HAVE ESCAPED WITHOUT STAINS?\r\n\r\nIt is possible for the murderer to escape without being spotted with\r\nblood, but the probability of this occurrence depends on the nature\r\nof the wound and the relative positions of the deceased and the\r\nassailant at the time the wounds were inflicted. This latter fact is\r\nvery largely, if not altogether, a matter of speculation as far as\r\nthe medical evidence goes. It is a popular, though false, idea that\r\na murderer’s clothes must be bloody, and the police may be misled in\r\nexpecting to find them so in every instance. Taylor[1] cites several\r\ncases in which either no blood was found on the murderer’s clothes,\r\nor only small spots wholly out of proportion to the amount of blood\r\nwhich must have spurted or flowed from the wound. Absence of blood on\r\nthe prisoner’s clothes is often made use of by the defence to prove\r\nthe prisoner’s innocence, whereas, besides the possibilities of having\r\nhad no spots in the first place, the clothes may have been changed\r\nor washed before the examination was made. This has occurred in more\r\nthan one murder trial. Taylor[648] mentions the following cases in\r\nillustration:\r\n\r\nIt was alleged that the absence of blood-stains on the prisoner’s\r\nclothing was a strong proof of his innocence in the trial of\r\nSub-Inspector Montgomery for the murder of Mr. Glasse (Omagh Ass.,\r\nJuly, 1873). In this case the weapon was a bill-hook which had produced\r\ncontused wounds on the head. There was blood on the floor about the\r\nbody, but the wounds were not likely to have been accompanied by much\r\nspurting. Yet it was assumed that the assailant in this case must\r\nhave been covered with blood. Much stress was laid upon the absence\r\nof blood-stains. On the first two trials the jury could not agree,\r\nowing chiefly to the absence of blood-stains, but on the third trial\r\nhe was convicted and afterward admitted that he had removed the\r\nblood-stains from the clothes with cold water. Also in the case of\r\nReg. _v._ Courvoisier (C.C.C., 1840) the accused, who was tried for\r\nthe murder of Lord William Russel, had no blood-stains on his clothes.\r\nAll the vessels of the throat of the deceased had been cut to the\r\nvertebræ while he was asleep. It was contended most strongly that the\r\naccused could not possibly have committed the crime, as he had no\r\nblood-stains. But after conviction he confessed that he wore no clothes\r\nwhen he committed the murder, and he only had to wash his hands and the\r\ncarving-knife he used. Again, in the case of Reg. _v._ Thompson (Durham\r\nWint. Ass., 1863) the defence mainly relied on the absence of blood on\r\nthe prisoner’s clothing. The wound in the throat of the wife of the\r\naccused was five inches long, directed from left to right, dividing\r\nall the vessels and nerves of the neck. The medical witness stated\r\njustly that no such wound could be self-inflicted. It was rapidly\r\nfatal. No weapon was found near the body. The prisoner was convicted.\r\n\r\nThe same author cites the case of a prisoner on whose trousers worn\r\nsoon after the murder no blood-marks were found, but the trousers\r\nactually worn by him were found with blood upon them. Juries have even\r\nacquitted the prisoner apparently only because no marks of blood were\r\nfound, though the other circumstances were explicable only on the\r\ntheory of murder.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered in this connection that blood-stains may be\r\nfound on the clothing of many, especially on the coarse clothing\r\nof working-people. This may be accounted for by the occupation,\r\nflea-bites, accidental circumstances, or it may occur without\r\ndefinite explanation. Such persons may be accused of murder and yet\r\nthe blood-stains be consistent with innocence. Too much importance\r\nshould not, therefore, be attached to them, even if the accused cannot\r\nsatisfactorily explain them and if he does not attempt to do so in\r\na suspicious way. That blood on the clothing even under suspicious\r\ncircumstances may be consistent with innocence is illustrated by the\r\ncase of a suicide by cutting the throat, in 1872, cited by Taylor.[649]\r\nIn this case the son first found his father dead, and thought that he\r\nhad broken a blood-vessel. He raised the body, staining his hands and\r\nclothes, then went for help. At the inquest he was closely questioned\r\nas to the presence of the blood-stains, but there could be no doubt\r\nthat the case was one of suicide.\r\n\r\nIn general, we may say that a murderer is much more likely to escape\r\nwithout blood-stains in contused wounds, and more likely in the case\r\nof punctured wounds than in incised wounds, for in punctured wounds\r\nthe bleeding is much less free and is less likely to spurt from the\r\nwound. In the case of incised wounds he is most apt to escape without\r\nstains if he is behind or to the side of the victim when he inflicts\r\nthe wound—in other words, when a part of the body of the deceased\r\nwas between the assailant and the wound inflicted. Furthermore, the\r\nassailant is more likely to escape without blood-stains if there is a\r\nsingle wound than if there are several, and each additional wound makes\r\nit more likely that he will be spotted with blood.\r\n\r\nThe _examination of the ground or floor and the furniture_, etc., may\r\nfurnish some evidence as to the nature of the crime, and also help\r\nthe witness to answer the questions which may sometimes be asked,\r\n_i.e._, AT WHAT SPOT WAS THE VICTIM WOUNDED? and WHERE DID HE DIE?\r\nThis question is sometimes settled by examination of the spot where\r\nthe deceased lay and the furniture, etc., about. Sometimes the floor\r\nor ground and the furniture or surrounding objects at a distance give\r\nthe requisite evidence. The examination of the cracks and corners of\r\nthe floor and furniture should not be neglected, and Taylor instances\r\na case where the hair of a dog helped to clear up the case. If the\r\nbody has not been disturbed the most blood is usually found where\r\nthe deceased died. If the victim succumbs at the spot where he was\r\nwounded, blood is found only in the immediate neighborhood, except for\r\narterial jets, which may be as far distant as two metres. The separate\r\nblood-spots of an arterial jet are circular if the jet strikes the\r\nobject perpendicularly, oval or wedge-shaped with the larger end away\r\nfrom the body if it strikes the object obliquely.\r\n\r\nIf the blood-stains are more diffused and are found in other places,\r\ncareful notice should be taken as to whether the different places\r\ncommunicate with one another by traces of blood. If they do not\r\ncommunicate, it goes to show that the body was moved after active\r\nbleeding had ceased, that is, after death, but this indication is\r\nnot absolutely positive. If traces of blood do connect the larger\r\nblood-spots, it is of interest and importance to know where the\r\ndeceased was wounded and where he died, also whether he moved or\r\nif he was moved before or after death. This question is not always\r\ncapable of solution. Some injuries exclude the possibility of active\r\nmotion. Stupefying contused injuries of the head or an incised wound\r\nopening a great artery are both inflicted where there is the greatest\r\nhemorrhage, and the spot where the deceased was wounded and died should\r\nbe identical. In such cases a second large spot of blood, connecting\r\nor not with the first wound, indicates that the body has been moved.\r\nBut if the wound does not bleed much or rapidly, the wounded person\r\nmay fall at a distance from the spot where he was injured, and death\r\noccurs, as a rule, where there is the greatest amount of blood; for a\r\ncertain amount of bleeding occurs for a short time after the victim\r\nfalls or even after death. One can find in many places the signs of\r\narterial jets marking the movement of the deceased from one blood-spot\r\nto another. This is quite different from the tracks caused by dragging\r\na bleeding body. All this it is important to notice, for the dragging\r\nor passive moving of the body strongly indicates murder. Blood at a\r\ndistance may indicate the occurrence of a struggle, or that the body\r\nwas moved, or it may show the tracks of a murderer. As to the latter\r\npoint, _the imprints of the hands and feet_, whether bloody or not,\r\nmay indicate murder and establish the identity of the murderer. We\r\nhave already seen how they may occur on the deceased and indicate a\r\nstruggle, and thus be presumptive of murder. When the marks are made by\r\nthe naked foot, it is well to examine it by lining it off in squares,\r\nand so to compare it with the imprint of the foot of the accused.\r\nSimple inspection can sometimes give the required evidence. We may\r\neven get an impression of such imprints in the snow. Imprints of the\r\nboots or shoes worn by the accused compared with those imprints found\r\nat and near the scene of the crime may sometimes help to clear up the\r\ncase, but this may perhaps be considered outside of the sphere of the\r\nmedical witness. Such and other signs of a struggle about one of the\r\nblood-spots would indicate that the wound was received there, though\r\ndeath may have occurred at another spot. In such a case it would be\r\nwell to examine to see if there was much blood where the body was\r\nfound, for if there was not it would indicate that the body had been\r\nmoved there after death, and thus be strongly presumptive of murder.\r\n\r\nAs furnishing some evidence which may help to distinguish between\r\nsuicide and homicide in the origin of wounds, the question may be\r\nasked, WHAT WAS THE POSITION OF THE VICTIM WHEN INJURED OR DYING? and\r\nalso, WHAT WERE THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE VICTIM AND ASSAILANT?\r\n\r\nThe position of the victim at the moment of the injury is sometimes\r\nindicated by the position of the wound, the direction of its tract,\r\nand the direction from the wound of the blood on the body and clothes.\r\nOn the neck or extremities the course and form of the wound may\r\nindicate the position of these parts when the wound was inflicted,\r\nfor sometimes in flexions of these parts the skin lies in folds, and\r\na wound inflicted when these parts were so flexed would be irregular,\r\nwavy, or zig-zag. Further, the position and movement of these parts\r\nnecessary to restore directness to the wound may indicate the position\r\nof the parts when the wound was inflicted. The examination of the\r\nrelative positions of the wound in the clothes and the body may help\r\nto indicate the position of the body when wounded. The position of\r\nthe blood on the body and the direction of the blood from the wound,\r\nwhether below or at the sides, etc., tends to show the position of\r\nthe body when bleeding. Thus if the body was at any time in the erect\r\nposition, some of the blood-stains will be vertically below the wound,\r\nor if the victim was lying on the back then the stain would be at the\r\nsides only and not below the wound, except such stains as indicate\r\nthat they were produced by arterial jets. Few suicides cut the throat\r\nin the recumbent position; therefore it may be considered in the light\r\nof an indication of homicide if the blood-stains show that the victim\r\nwas not erect after the wound was inflicted. It is well also to note\r\nthe form, direction, and obliquity of the blood-spot. This would\r\nindicate, by comparison with the wound, the relative position of the\r\nwounded person and the blood-spot, and thus show whether the body had\r\nbeen moved or not, as, for instance, by the murderer for the purpose\r\nof robbery. The force of the bleeding is also indicated by the form of\r\nthe spot, and this would indicate how rapidly death probably ensued.\r\nThis fact might thus help us to judge whether the victim probably died\r\nwhere he was wounded, and whether other and remote blood-spots would\r\nnot be presumptive of murder. If the victim is found in night-clothes,\r\nthis fact would help to show that he was lying down when wounded. The\r\nmedical evidence as to the position of the victim when injured is,\r\ntherefore, circumstantial and not very positive; that in regard to the\r\n_relative position of the victim and assailant_ is even less positive.\r\nWe presuppose in this question that the case is one of murder. We are\r\nnot to prove murder or refute suicide. We can rarely be _positive_ as\r\nto the relative position of the assailed and the assailant. A wound\r\nin the back may be caused by some one in front with an arm behind.\r\nThe direction of the wound would indicate this, for if the assailant\r\nis right-handed and inflicts a wound on the back from in front, a\r\nstab-wound would almost always be directed from left to right, an\r\nincised wound from right to left, both from above downward. With a\r\nleft-handed murderer the direction would most likely be from right to\r\nleft and from above downward for a stab-wound, and from left to right\r\nand from above downward for an incised wound. If the assailant were at\r\nthe back of the victim and wounded him in front, the direction of these\r\nwounds would be the opposite of the above, _i.e._, from right to left\r\nfor a stab-wound and from left to right and from above downward for\r\nan incised wound with a right-handed assailant and _vice versa_ with\r\na left-handed assailant. These wounds occur more commonly than those\r\nof the back, and are especially noticeable in incised wounds of the\r\nthroat. In the case of these incised wounds of the throat inflicted\r\nfrom behind, the direction from left to right and from above downward\r\nresembles that of self-inflicted wounds in the same situation. As\r\na general rule, wounds are on the same side of the victim that the\r\nassailant was; the facts given above help to show us the exceptions.\r\nThus a wound on one side is presumptive that the murderer was on that\r\nside, or possibly at the front or back and only exceptionally on the\r\nopposite side. The presence of wounds on one side only may help to\r\nconfirm the testimony of a witness that the victim was against a wall\r\nor some other obstacle which protected the other side. The question of\r\nthe relative position of the combatants in duels and the nature of the\r\nweapons used as shown by the wounds has sometimes come up, especially\r\nin other countries, to determine whether the combat was regular and\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of suspected suicide, but where a doubt exists between\r\nsuicide and murder, or even accident, _hereditary disposition and\r\norganic affections_ of the body, such as alcoholism, incurable or\r\npainful diseases, chronic inflammation of the brain and meninges or of\r\nthe genito-urinary organs—all such and hereditary predisposition may\r\nsupport the idea of suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPUTED OR SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nClosely allied with the question of the suicidal or homicidal origin\r\nof wounds is the question whether a wound imputed to another is\r\nself-inflicted or inflicted by another. These wounds are seldom fatal.\r\nIn discussing the question whether a wound is self-inflicted or\r\ninflicted by another, we have referred occasionally to suicidal wounds\r\nwhere the circumstances were such as apparently purposely to imply\r\nmurder and impute the cause of death to some one else. This happens\r\nmore often in cases of unsuccessful suicide. Here we have recourse to\r\nthe same evidence that we have gone over in the present section which\r\nhelps to distinguish between a suicidal and a homicidal wound. The\r\ncase may be somewhat more difficult, as the unsuccessful suicide may\r\nmanufacture evidence against the accused and hide to some extent the\r\nevidence of suicide. These cases can usually be decided, however, in\r\nconnection with the circumstantial and other evidence. The majority\r\nof cases of imputed but self-inflicted wounds are very superficial,\r\noften not below the true skin. Being self-inflicted they have many\r\nof the characters of suicidal wounds. Thus they are usually situated\r\nin front and on the left or right according as the wounded person is\r\nright or left handed, and the direction is usually similar to that in\r\nsuicidal wounds. Such wounds are generally incised or punctured wounds,\r\nseldom contused wounds, and in this respect they resemble suicidal\r\nwounds. As exceptions to this rule, Bergeret[650] mentions some cases\r\nwhere females in attacks of hysteria have inflicted severe contusions\r\non themselves, and have preferred charges of attempted murder against\r\ninnocent persons. Like suicides also the hands are seldom injured,\r\nthough they may be much so in resisting homicide.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, however, these wounds differ from suicidal wounds.\r\nThus they are not usually situated over a “mortal” spot, and they are\r\noften numerous and _scattered_, sometimes parallel and sometimes not.\r\nThe wounds in the dress do not correspond even as often as in suicide.\r\nIn comparing cuts in clothing with those on the body, it is important\r\nto find what articles were worn at the time the assault was alleged to\r\nhave taken place, and to make sure that the clothes examined were those\r\nworn or alleged to have been worn. It may not be necessary that the\r\nclothes examined should have been really worn, for if they were alleged\r\nto have been worn and were not, the examination of them will almost\r\nalways show the deception or the self-inflicted nature of the wounds.\r\nThen take careful note of the position, direction, form, and size\r\nof the cut and the apparent sharpness of the weapon in the several\r\nlayers, and see if they correspond with one another and with the wounds\r\non the body in those various particulars. In imputed wounds the clothes\r\nare generally cut when off the body and can seldom be done so as to\r\ndeceive a careful examiner. Several wounds cannot exist in the same\r\nregion of the body without some being bloody and showing the marks of\r\nit on the clothes. Even a single wound of the clothes generally shows\r\nblood on the inner surface if there is a corresponding wound of the\r\nbody underneath. In simulated and imputed injuries the blood-stain may\r\nbe on the outside of the clothing instead of on the inside, showing\r\nthat it was artificial and not natural. An impostor may either do too\r\nmuch or too little, and the medical witness should be on guard against\r\nboth alternatives. Taylor[651] mentions a case which occurred in\r\nLondon some time ago, in which there were _two_ cuts in the shirt near\r\ntogether exactly alike in size, form, and direction, making it evident\r\nthat the weapon had gone through a fold of the shirt. This proved that\r\nthe shirt could not have been worn at the time it was cut, for if the\r\nshirt was folded while on the body the weapon must have gone through\r\nthe fold and then through another layer of shirt, making three cuts\r\ninstead of two, or five instead of four, before it could have reached\r\nthe body. This and other facts made self-infliction of the slight wound\r\non the chest probable. The same author cites another case showing the\r\nimperfect manner in which the cuts in the clothes are made in imputed\r\nwounds, the clothes being off the body at the time. The case occurred\r\nin Nottingham in 1872, the accused being charged with wounding the\r\nplaintiff on the highway by stabbing him in the arm, though there was\r\nno robbery or other motive for the act. The coat and shirt sleeve were\r\nfound cut, but there was no corresponding cut in the lining of the coat\r\nsleeve. The charge was clearly false, and was trumped up by the youth\r\nwho was the plaintiff because he wished to leave the place where he had\r\nbeen sent for private study.\r\n\r\nIn examining a case where the self-inflicted nature of imputed wounds\r\nis in question, the following are some of the many points to keep in\r\nmind in the examination and to be ascertained by the examination:\r\n(1) The relative position of the plaintiff and the assailant at the\r\ntime of the alleged attack. This can be compared with the position\r\nas stated by the plaintiff or other witnesses. (2) The situation,\r\ndirection, depth, nature, and number of the wounds. (3) The situation\r\nand direction of blood-marks or wounds on the dress or person of either\r\nor both. (4) The marks of blood and the quantity of it at the spot of\r\nthe alleged struggle. (5) The signs of a struggle and the various other\r\npoints of circumstantial evidence gone over in considering suicidal and\r\nhomicidal wounds.\r\n\r\nThough a severe blow may cause a slight mark, it does not follow that\r\na slight mark implies a severe injury, else the exception is made the\r\nrule. The inconsistency of the story of the plaintiff is generally so\r\npalpable that imposture is evident, but prejudice and unjust suspicion\r\nare often excited against those accused. Thus Taylor[652] states that\r\n“a strong suspicion was raised against the then Duke of Cumberland, in\r\n1810, in reference to the death of Sellis, when a skilful examination\r\nof the wounds on the deceased would have shown that they might have\r\nbeen self-inflicted.” The same author also cites the case of M. Armand,\r\na merchant of Montpelier, who at Aix in March, 1864, was tried for an\r\nalleged murderous assault on, or imputed murderous strangulation of,\r\nhis servant. The excoriation on the back of the neck was so slight as\r\nto escape the observation of some medical men, and it was evidently\r\nself-inflicted, either accidentally or purposely, as the facts showed.\r\nThe assertions of a number of medical men were taken by the court to\r\nsupport the servant’s story to the effect that his master had struck\r\nhim a severe blow on the back of his neck, rendering him insensible for\r\nmany hours from concussion of the brain. The evidence given chiefly by\r\nTardieu for the defence showed the story of the complainant to be a\r\nfabrication, and the accused was justly acquitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS A WOUND ACCIDENTAL?\r\n\r\nIn answering this question we must distinguish accidental wounds from\r\nthose self-inflicted and those inflicted by another. These three\r\nclasses comprise all wounds. In case of a trial for murder it may be\r\nalleged by the defence that the wound was caused by accident or that\r\nit was due to suicide from a fall, falls being a common class of\r\naccidental wounds. So we have to judge between accident on the one\r\nhand and homicide and suicide on the other hand. The question arises\r\nespecially in cases where the injury causing death is one commonly due\r\nto accident.\r\n\r\nAs to the QUESTION BETWEEN ACCIDENTAL AND SUICIDAL WOUNDS, they are\r\noften easily distinguished, especially if the body has not been\r\ndisturbed. In suicide there is clear evidence of design, and the\r\ncircumstantial evidence helps to make the case clear. It may not always\r\nbe possible to decide, however, as an accidental wound may sometimes\r\nresemble a suicidal or homicidal one. Accident is often shown by the\r\n_nature_ of the wound. Thus it is rare for an accidental mortal wound\r\nto be caused by a knife or similar weapon held in the hand and forced\r\ninto the body by a fall, the blow of an opening door, etc. But such\r\nexceptional cases have been reported. Incised and punctured wounds\r\nare, therefore, very rarely accidental, and most accidental wounds are\r\ncontused wounds or contusions.\r\n\r\nAgain, accident is often shown by the _situation_ of the wound, which\r\nshould be on an exposed part of the body unless the accident is due to\r\na fall from a height, when the wound may be almost anywhere. But such\r\ninjuries are easily shown to be due to falls. The fall, of course,\r\nmay be accidental, suicidal, or homicidal. Some wounds in exposed\r\nparts forbid accident on account of their nature, _i.e._, deep incised\r\nwounds of the throat. If the deceased has a life insurance, suicide\r\nis less probable, as the insurance is not paid in case of suicide. In\r\nfine, accidental wounds are distinguished from suicidal by—(1) Their\r\n_nature_; accidental wounds are almost always contused, suicidal very\r\nrarely so, only in cases of lunatics and delirious persons and where\r\nsuicide is accomplished by a fall. (2) The situation of the wound or\r\nwounds indicates their origin. We have already studied the situation\r\nof suicidal wounds and have also seen that accidental wounds are only\r\non exposed parts, except when the injury clearly indicates a fall from\r\na height. The evidence from the direction of wounds rarely applies, as\r\nthis is valuable only in incised and punctured wounds, which are seldom\r\naccidental. Both kinds of wounds are usually few in number except in\r\ncase of a fall from a height or a crush, though sometimes suicidal\r\nwounds are multiple.\r\n\r\nThe evidence from weapons, if there be any, points strongly to suicide.\r\nThe signs of a struggle are hardly consistent with either suicide or\r\naccident. The only case in which they might occur would be where a\r\nstruggle occurred to prevent a suicide from throwing himself off a\r\nheight or before a vehicle or railway train. In such a case accident\r\nwould be excluded by the signs of a struggle, and the question would\r\nlie between homicide and suicide. The examination of the clothes of\r\nthe deceased would furnish no evidence unless some letter or paper\r\nwere found stating the purpose of committing suicide. Little or no\r\nevidence would be furnished by the position of the body when found\r\nin cases which might otherwise be doubtful. Organic lesions or other\r\nfacts predisposing to suicide would furnish presumptive evidence\r\nagainst the wounds being accidental. Of all these various points the\r\nfirst, as to the nature of the wounds, is by itself the most valuable\r\nand conclusive. But this gives us no assistance in clearing up a case\r\nwhere it is doubtful whether a fall from a height or a crush by a\r\nvehicle or railway train was accidental or suicidal. Some of the other\r\npoints mentioned may aid us in such a case, and also the fact that such\r\ninjuries are far more often accidental than suicidal. But in these\r\ncases, also, certain circumstances may show that the fall was not the\r\nresult of accident.\r\n\r\nAccidental wounds are generally caused by a fall or a crush, and\r\nthe fact of their accidental character is generally established by\r\nthe circumstances of the event. Certain accidental wounds present\r\ncharacteristics which allow the true nature of the wounds to be\r\ndetermined. But in some cases a suspicion may arise and the question\r\nmay be asked as to WHETHER THE WOUND WAS ACCIDENTAL OR HOMICIDAL. For\r\ninstance, if a person receives fatal homicidal injuries, and just\r\nbefore or after death the body is thrown from a height or is run\r\nover and crushed, it may be hard to determine the murderous element\r\namong the many wounds. This is the case if the homicidal wounds were\r\ncontusions or were caused by blunt instruments, but rarely, if ever\r\nso, if they are incised or punctured wounds or both. But even in the\r\nformer instance, a close examination of the lesions and of the locality\r\nof the injury can often clear up the case. Thus in a case mentioned\r\nby Vibert,[653] as cited by Hofmann after Taylor, a woman was found\r\ndead at the foot of some stairs in a cave. She had died of a fracture\r\nof the skull and of the spine, produced by the fall. But about four or\r\nfive feet above the level of the top step there was found on the wall\r\nthe fresh marks of an arterial jet of blood. Examination showed a wound\r\nin the right temporal region which had opened the temporal artery, and\r\nit was therefore thought that the woman was wounded at the top of the\r\nstairway and then thrown down, which was afterward proved to be true.\r\nIn another case, reported by M. Tourdes, a man knocked down and killed\r\nby an axe, which crushed his skull and caused the brain to exude, was\r\nplaced in a road frequented at night by heavy wagons. The head was\r\nplaced in the rut, but the coagulated blood and brain formed a puddle\r\nwhich did not appear on the wheels or their track, and no bloody furrow\r\nwas caused by their passage. The same author mentions the case of a\r\nwoman plainly strangulated by the hands and then thrown into the ditch\r\nof the fortifications of Paris.\r\n\r\nIt is especially with regard to fractures of the skull that the\r\nquestion often comes up as to the accidental or homicidal nature of\r\nthe injury, as to whether it is due to a fall or a wound. Sometimes a\r\ndepressed fracture may show the form of the instrument. An extensive\r\ncomminuted fracture of the skull may indicate greater violence than\r\nwould be received from a fall from the little height which the\r\ncircumstances may allow. As to the slighter degrees of fracture,\r\nthe disposition of the fracture itself often shows less than the\r\nform and site of the ecchymosis, the lesion of the scalp, and the\r\nplace and position of the body when found. In such cases the traces\r\nof a struggle, the existence of other wounds, etc., may be of great\r\nimportance. In distinguishing between homicide and accident, as in\r\ndistinguishing between the latter and suicide, the most obscure and\r\ndifficult cases are those where the injury has been caused by a fall\r\nfrom a height or by a crush.\r\n\r\nThis is illustrated by the case of Madame de Tourville, which is\r\nquoted by Taylor.[654] She was killed in July, 1876, by a fall from a\r\nprecipice. Her husband, a lawyer, was accused of murder committed by\r\npushing her over a precipice in the Stelvio Pass. The place where her\r\ndead body was found was at a considerable depth below, and the injury\r\nwas chiefly in the head, which had been crushed by the fall. The body\r\nshowed no evidence of intentional violence. The prisoner’s guilt was\r\nestablished on the following points: (1) The false and inconsistent\r\nstatements made as to the occurrence; (2) the marks of the body having\r\nbeen dragged some distance so that a part of the dress was found, in\r\na bloody condition, some way from the body; (3) there were marks of\r\nblood on the prisoner’s hands and clothing. After a long trial he was\r\nconvicted, though the sentence was afterward commuted to imprisonment\r\nfor life. Of course, as we have already stated, if a person is\r\nresponsible for a fall he is also responsible for the results of the\r\nfall. This applies to many of the contused injuries and deaths from\r\nfalls in prize-fights and drunken brawls.\r\n\r\nWe may sum up the points of evidence which help us to distinguish\r\nbetween an accidental and a homicidal injury much as we did when the\r\nquestion lay between accident and suicide. (1) The evidence from the\r\nnature of the wound is not quite so conclusive as when the question\r\nlies between suicide and accident. For contusions and contused wounds\r\nare far more often homicidal than suicidal, and accidental wounds\r\nare almost always of this class. If, however, the wounds are incised\r\nor punctured, this fact points almost certainly to homicide. (2) As\r\nto situation, a homicidal wound may be situated almost anywhere; an\r\naccidental wound, except in falls from a height, only on an exposed\r\nplace. (3) The direction of the wound can seldom help us in the case\r\nof contused wounds which, practically, are the only ones in question,\r\nthough it may possibly be incompatible with accident. (4) As to the\r\nnumber of wounds, homicidal wounds are far more apt to be multiple\r\neither in a small area or scattered in such a way that an accident\r\ncould hardly account for them all. (5) A weapon may give evidence more\r\noften here than when suicide is in question, for a weapon may be used\r\nto inflict contused wounds which may resemble those received in a fall.\r\nThe evidence furnished by a weapon or blood, hair, etc., on the weapon,\r\netc., is strongly in favor of murder. (6) The evidence from a struggle\r\nis also more important because it is more often found. A struggle may\r\noccur in homicide, and only in homicide, as a rule, so that signs\r\nof a struggle are strong evidence of murder and against the idea of\r\naccident. (7) The examination of the clothes and body of the deceased\r\nmay give valuable evidence, showing, as it may, signs of a struggle or\r\nother marks of an assailant and indicating murder. (8) Examination of\r\nthe position and attitude of the body and of the spot where it lay and\r\nthe ground around may furnish more or less proof of murder, as in the\r\ncase quoted above. Thus the track of the murderer may be discovered\r\nor the body may have been interfered with and moved or robbed, all\r\nindicating homicide.\r\n\r\nIn any case, whether it is desired to distinguish accidental from\r\nsuicidal or homicidal wounds, those cases present the most difficulty\r\nwhich result from falls from a height or crushes. But, as the case of\r\nMadame de Tourville shows, the above given and other circumstances may\r\noften show even then that the fall or the crush was not the result of\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nFALLS FROM A HEIGHT may, therefore, be the result of suicide, homicide,\r\nor accident. The injuries are similar in all three cases. A fall of six\r\nto eight metres causes, as a rule, numerous lesions, and shows such\r\na traumatism that the case usually excludes the possibility or, at\r\nleast, the probability that the wounds resulted from blows. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, the gravity of the lesion is not proportional to the height\r\nof the fall. Thus Vibert[655] relates the case of a man, afterward\r\nemployed for several years in the École de Médicine, who jumped from\r\nthe top of the column of the Bastile, a height of fifty metres. He\r\nrebounded on to some canvas stretched at the foot of the monument, then\r\nfell to the ground, and was able to get up and walk away. Curiously\r\nenough, he killed himself later by jumping from the top of an omnibus\r\nin motion. In the case of falls from a height, it is especially true\r\nthat with grave lesions internally the skin may be intact or only\r\nslightly ecchymosed or eroded, or the ecchymosis may be only deeply\r\nseated so as not to appear superficially. In the latter case, if life\r\nhad continued the ecchymosis might have shown itself at some spot on\r\nthe surface in a few days, but these falls from a height are fatal as\r\na rule. In falls from a height, besides ecchymoses, which may occur\r\nwhere there are no other injuries or may fail where there are many\r\ninjuries, the _lesions_ consist of fractures of bones and ruptures of\r\ninternal organs, with or without surface wounds. The _fractures_ may\r\nbe of a number of bones, and especially of those which first touched\r\nthe ground, though the skull may be fractured at some part whether or\r\nnot it was struck in the fall. These fractures are often comminuted,\r\nespecially fractures of the skull and pelvis, and when the fall is from\r\na great height. Ruptures of muscles may occur with the fractures.\r\n\r\nRuptures of internal organs are not rare in such cases. According\r\nto Vibert,[656] the order of frequency of rupture of the various\r\norgans is as follows: liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs, heart, stomach,\r\nintestines, bladder, brain. Rupture of the liver occurs especially on\r\nthe anterior and inferior surfaces and the bleeding is rather abundant.\r\nThe healthy spleen does not rupture readily, except from a severe\r\ntraumatism, but if it is hypertrophied it may rupture spontaneously\r\nfrom muscular violence. The lung may be ruptured internally without\r\nshowing the rupture on the surface and with the ribs intact. Two such\r\ncases are mentioned by Vibert,[657] and he refers to others mentioned\r\nby Nelaton and Holmes. Rupture of the brain without fracture of the\r\nskull is very rare, though cases have been observed and reported,\r\namong others by Casper-Liman. In falls from a height the rupture of\r\nthe aorta, mesentery, diaphragm, and larynx have been noted. It should\r\nbe remembered in this connection that rupture of the liver, intestine,\r\nbladder, etc., may be caused by contusions without sign of violence\r\nexternally, and such cases cannot, therefore, be attributed to falls\r\nunless there are other signs of the latter.\r\n\r\nIn _crushes_ caused by a heavy vehicle, the lesions resemble in many\r\nrespects those due to a fall from a height. Thus we find fractures and\r\ninternal ruptures, but we more often and regularly find subcutaneous\r\necchymoses and ecchymoses between the muscles. The skin is often\r\nstripped up extensively and the injuries are generally limited to the\r\nregion injured. It is rare to find that the cause of the injury leaves\r\nno trace on the skin, for it usually gives the form to the erosions\r\nor ecchymoses. Sometimes, for instance, the marks of a horseshoe are\r\nclearly visible. Ruptures of internal organs may occur here too when\r\nthere are slight external marks of violence or even none at all. Thus\r\nVibert[658] relates the case of a man with the head crushed, but with\r\nno signs of injury to the trunk save a few erosions at the level of\r\nthe sternum, who had not only rupture of the kidneys, the liver, and\r\nthe spleen, but also of the lungs and of the heart. In the heart the\r\napex was completely detached and floating in the pericardium, which\r\nwas intact. There was no fracture of the ribs nor subcutaneous or\r\nsub-muscular ecchymoses. The age of the subject was thirty-two, so\r\nthat the costal cartilages were not probably ossified, which may have\r\naccounted for the absence of fracture of the ribs.\r\n\r\n_Crushes by the fall of heavy weights_ resemble the latter class of\r\ncrushes, and differ from falls from a height in the fact that the\r\nwounds are usually limited to one region. The lesions themselves are\r\nmore or less similar. Similar internal lesions may be caused by the\r\ncompression of the chest and body by the knee of a murderer, which may\r\noccasion rupture of the internal organs, fractures of ribs, etc. Thus,\r\ntoo, from the pressure of a crowd the ribs may be fractured and the\r\nlungs injured. It is particularly in these cases of injury from crushes\r\nor falls from a height that we may have most difficulty, as far as the\r\nmedical evidence goes, of distinguishing between accident, suicide,\r\nand murder. But the various points and considerations mentioned above\r\nwill sometimes enable the medical witness to clear up the case. In\r\nsome cases the non-medical evidence, circumstantial and otherwise, may\r\nbe sufficient of itself, or at least in conjunction with the medical\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIn falls from a less high place the difficulty is somewhat different,\r\nfor here there may arise the question between a fall and a contusion or\r\ncontused wound, and the question generally lies between accident and\r\nmurder, or, very rarely, between accident and suicide. We have referred\r\nto both of these questions above, and from the facts mentioned the case\r\ncan often be solved.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF MORE THAN ONE INJURY WHICH WAS THE FIRST INFLICTED?\r\n\r\nWe can sometimes tell the order in which wounds were received, but\r\nthe question is rarely answerable with certainty. If one wound is\r\nmortal and one or more are not, whether the wounds are suicidal or\r\nhomicidal, it has sometimes been considered that the former must have\r\nbeen inflicted last. But we cannot admit that as a general rule the\r\nmost grave wound was the last inflicted. For the murderer or suicide,\r\nespecially the former, may go on wounding after the infliction of a\r\nmortal wound, especially as it is the exception, and not the rule,\r\nto die instantly after a mortal wound. Several assailants may have\r\ninflicted wounds at the same time, which would still further increase\r\nthe difficulty. The question might then arise, Which assailant had\r\ninflicted the mortal wound or which had first inflicted a mortal wound?\r\nUnder such circumstances, it would not be easy to give a specific\r\nanswer. There are several signs which may indicate which wound was\r\nfirst inflicted in certain cases. An instrument may become duller or\r\neven bent or twisted after and on account of the first wound, and the\r\nsubsequent wounds would vary accordingly. The wound of the clothes\r\ncorresponding to the first stab-wound may be and often is only bloody\r\ninternally, while the second and following wounds are bloody on both\r\nsides. The following case quoted by Taylor[659] from the _Annales\r\nd’Hygiene_, 1847, p. 461, illustrates this point. A man received three\r\nstabs from an assailant, one in the back at the level of the eighth\r\nrib, traversing the lung and heart and causing rapid death, and two on\r\nthe left elbow, cutting the coat and shirt but only grazing the skin.\r\nThe first one was evidently the first inflicted, for both the wounds in\r\nthe clothing on the arm were bloody externally at the edges, although\r\nthere was no blood effused here. The correctness of this opinion was\r\nconfirmed at the trial.\r\n\r\nThe point of a knife arrested and broken off in a bone may show that\r\nthis was the last wound. The amount of bleeding may show which was the\r\nfirst wound. Thus if several severe wounds have been inflicted, all\r\nor several of which would naturally cause profuse hemorrhage, and one\r\nshowed signs of such hemorrhage while another did not, the former would\r\nbe likely to be the first wound inflicted. Or if one showed slight\r\nhemorrhage where much would be expected, this fact would indicate that\r\nit was one of the last inflicted. The absence of the signs of spurting\r\nblood may tell which of two or more fatal wounds were first inflicted,\r\nfor this would indicate that this wound was inflicted when the heart\r\naction was weakened by loss of blood or even after death, and the\r\nother wound or wounds which did not present this sign would have been\r\nthe first received. In fact, if any of the signs are present about a\r\nwound which we have seen to indicate that a wound was inflicted at any\r\ntime after death, this would show that this wound was not the first\r\nreceived, and that the other or others were inflicted earlier.\r\n\r\nQuestions as to the CONSEQUENCES of WOUNDS NOT FATAL may often be\r\nbrought up in civil actions for damages. In certain countries the\r\nquestion of the consequences as to _incapacity_ may determine whether\r\nan injury shall be the ground of a criminal as well as of a civil\r\naction. Thus in France an injury which involves an incapacity of twenty\r\ndays or more subjects the assailant to a criminal action. The term\r\n“incapacity” in this instance refers to general incapacity and not\r\nto incapacity for fine and professional work. The latter, however,\r\ncomes in under the civil action which may be instituted against the\r\nassailant or those directly or indirectly responsible for the injury.\r\nThe amount of the incapacity, its causes, whether due wholly or partly\r\nor not at all to the given injury, the probable duration of the\r\nincapacity, the treatment which it has and will necessitate, and many\r\nother such questions form part of the medical testimony required in\r\nsuch cases. Sometimes with slight wounds the results, accompaniments,\r\nand complications may prolong the incapacity very greatly, as also the\r\nstate of health and the habits of the wounded person, the neglect of\r\ntreatment, improper treatment, etc.\r\n\r\nAny bodily or mental infirmity or ill-health which may result from an\r\ninjury and its necessary treatment in the past and future, all these\r\nquestions and many more unnecessary to mention may be required of the\r\nmedical witness. No general rules can be laid down for all such cases.\r\nIn giving his testimony the medical man must depend in any particular\r\ncase upon his knowledge, judgment, and experience.\r\n\r\nWe can seldom give a precise solution of the _question of survival_\r\nto determine the succession or inheritance if several of a family die\r\ntogether in an accident. In case of death from inanition, cold or heat,\r\nor in drowning especially, if some have wounds more or less grave in\r\nthemselves, we can sometimes form an opinion. With wounds we cannot\r\noften do so, although in case of murder, the nature of the wounds, the\r\nposition of the bodies, the examination of the spot of the accident or\r\ntragedy, may sometimes help us to form an opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCISED AND PUNCTURED WOUNDS AND WOUNDS OF BLUNT INSTRUMENTS REGIONALLY\r\nCONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nThe several varieties of wounds which we have been considering vary\r\nconsiderably in their nature, their effects, their danger, and in\r\nmany other ways according to the region of the body in which they are\r\nsituated. Some of these varieties are common in one situation and\r\nalmost never occur in others. Although the nature of wounds found in\r\nthe several regions of the body is not as important for a medical\r\njurist as their danger and their influence in causing death, we will\r\nnow consider the differences they exhibit on account of the region in\r\nwhich they occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\nThese are often characterized by their apparent harmlessness and\r\ntheir real gravity sooner or later. We might almost make the opposite\r\nstatement and say that those apparently grave are often virtually\r\nharmless, though this would be true only in a limited sense and in\r\ncertain cases.\r\n\r\nAs to their _nature_, we find punctured wounds extremely rarely,\r\nincised and lacerated wounds often, while contusions and contused\r\nwounds are still more common. _Incised and lacerated wounds_ of the\r\nhead involve the scalp almost exclusively. These wounds heal remarkably\r\nwell, even when the attachment is merely by a narrow pedicle, owing\r\nto the abundant blood-supply. Hemorrhage from the incised wounds is\r\noften free, for the vessels cannot retract, but it is seldom dangerous\r\nunless the wounds are very extensive. The only way in which they differ\r\nmaterially from similar wounds elsewhere is in the greater frequency\r\nof complicating erysipelas here than elsewhere. This is probably\r\nowing to the presence of septic conditions, as the head is generally\r\ndirtier than other parts of the body, and slight wounds especially\r\nare neglected. If the scalp is shaved over a wide margin and cleaned\r\nlike other parts of the body, erysipelas is found little or no\r\noftener than with similar wounds elsewhere. The density of the scalp\r\nis so great that the redness and swelling accompanying inflammations\r\nis comparatively slight. If erysipelas follows slight wounds of the\r\nhead, there is some reason to suspect constitutional predisposition or\r\ncareless treatment. From infection of such wounds of the scalp abscess\r\nor diffuse cellulitis of the scalp may develop as well as erysipelas.\r\nThe constitutional symptoms in such a case may be marked or even\r\nsevere, but the prognosis is favorable. In very rare cases necrosis of\r\nthe skull may result or the inflammation may even extend to the brain.\r\nThese incised and lacerated wounds of the scalp are usually accidental\r\nor inflicted by another; they are rarely self-inflicted. _Contusions\r\nand contused wounds_ are the most common forms of injury to the head.\r\nThese two kinds of injuries are almost invariably inflicted by another\r\nor are accidental. We have already seen that contused wounds of the\r\nscalp or over the eyebrow may closely resemble incised wounds in these\r\nlocalities. This fact should be borne in mind, as careful examination\r\ncan usually distinguish them if they are fresh and until they begin to\r\ngranulate. These wounds are liable to the same complications as incised\r\nwounds, in fact more liable, as the contusion makes the wound more\r\nsusceptible to inflammation and the edges are more apt to be infected\r\nat the time of the injury.\r\n\r\nOne of the _results_ of contusions of the head is the extravasation of\r\nblood, most often between the aponeurosis of the occipito-frontalis\r\nmuscle and the pericranium. These extravasations are usually in the\r\nform of a hematoma. Such hematomata often present a hard circular or\r\noval rim with a softer centre, and may readily be mistaken for fracture\r\nof the skull with depression. The diagnosis between hematoma and\r\ndepressed fracture is not usually difficult, however, for with hematoma\r\nthe ridge is elevated above the level of the skull and is movable on\r\nthe surface of the skull; also the wounded edges often pit on pressure.\r\nWith depressed fracture, on the other hand, the edge is at or about the\r\nlevel of the rest of the skull; it is sharper, more irregular, and less\r\nevenly circular. Contusions and the resulting hematoma may occasionally\r\nend by suppurating, but this event is rare. Contusions and contused\r\nwounds may occasionally show the marks of a weapon, indicating that\r\nthey were inflicted by another. Also the position of the injury will\r\nindicate its origin, whether it is accidental or inflicted by another,\r\nfor the former would not naturally occur on the vertex unless the fall\r\nwas from a considerable height.\r\n\r\nAnother result of injuries to the head, especially of contusions and\r\ncontused wounds, is FRACTURE OF THE SKULL. This may be simple or\r\ncompound, depressed or not, etc. Fractures are serious inasmuch as\r\nthey imply a degree of violence which may do damage to the brain.\r\nThe fracture itself, especially if properly treated, affords a good\r\nprognosis, irrespective of any brain lesion. One variety of fracture of\r\nthe skull offers an exception to this favorable prognosis, and that is\r\nfractures of the base of the skull. These may be fatal directly from\r\ninjury of the vital centres at the base of the brain or soon fatal from\r\nhemorrhage in these parts. Or the fatal result may be secondary to an\r\ninflammation or meningitis which good treatment is often unable to\r\nprevent. It should not be considered that these fractures are uniformly\r\nfatal, for quite a considerable proportion recover. Fracture of the\r\nbase usually occurs as the result of a fall. The injured person may\r\nland on the feet or buttocks, and yet receive a fracture of the base of\r\nthe skull, the force of the fall being transmitted through the spine to\r\nthe base of the skull. Fracture of the base of the skull usually occurs\r\nfrom an injury to the vault, not by _contre coup_, but by extension\r\nof a fissure found higher up in the skull. This extension takes place\r\nin the same meridian line of the skull with that of the force which\r\nproduced the fracture, and in this way the base of the skull is\r\nfractured in different parts according to the point and direction of\r\nthe application of the force. Thus in case the force compresses the\r\nskull antero-posteriorly the fracture will pass antero-posteriorly\r\ntoward the base from the front or the back, whichever received the blow\r\n(see Fig. 13). Fractures of the vault of the skull occasionally occur\r\nopposite to the point struck; this may occur by _contre coup_, but not\r\nalways so, as not infrequently in such rare cases a close examination\r\nmay reveal an extension of a fissure from the point injured to the\r\nopposite pole of the skull. The shape and rarely the size of a fracture\r\nof the skull, especially if punctured in character, may show the shape\r\nand more rarely the size of the instrument or object which produced\r\nit. Apart from fracture of the base, the prognosis in fracture of the\r\nskull is serious, mainly on account of the danger of inflammation,\r\nwhich is greater in compound fractures, and also on account of the more\r\nremote danger of irritation from depressed fragments causing epilepsy,\r\ninsanity, etc., at a later period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—Several Fractures of the Left Half of the\r\nBase of the Skull, Running Parallel to One Another and Approaching One\r\nAnother, also Separation of the Mastoid Suture. The injury was caused\r\nby a fall on the left side of the back of the head.]\r\n\r\nA circumstance that Taylor[660] says is connected with fracture of the\r\nskull with depression—namely, that the person, sensible as long as the\r\nobject producing the fracture remained wedged in, became insensible and\r\nbegan to manifest other fatal symptoms as soon as it was removed—must\r\nbe extremely exceptional. It may be explained, if it occurs, by the\r\noccurrence of hemorrhage after the object which occluded an open\r\nvessel by its presence or its pressure was removed. For it should be\r\nremembered that the symptoms of compression in a depressed fracture\r\nof the skull are very rarely due to the compressing effect of the\r\ndepressed bone, but rather to an injury of the brain, intracranial\r\nhemorrhage, or a local and temporary interference with the circulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—“Terraced” Fracture of the Left Parietal Bone\r\nnear the Sagittal Suture, caused by the Lower Part of the Rim of a\r\nRound-Headed Hammer. The blow was struck from the right side. ½ natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nWe may truly say that wounds of the head are dangerous in proportion as\r\nthey affect the brain. The existence of affection of the brain may be\r\nhard to tell from the appearances, for an injured person may recover\r\nfrom the first effects of a comparatively slight wound and yet die\r\nsuddenly later.\r\n\r\n=Concussion= is the name applied to one of the effects on the brain\r\nof a more or less violent blow directly on the head or transmitted\r\nindirectly to the head. Though the term “concussion” implies a\r\nfunctional rather than an organic lesion, yet in the majority of cases\r\nit is equivalent to laceration of the brain. With laceration of the\r\nbrain there is usually more or less effusion of blood which may be\r\nlimited to a very thin layer. Concussion may exist without laceration\r\nof the brain. Even death has been known to occur from concussion of\r\nthe brain without any visible signs of injury to the brain, so that\r\nthe concussion must have been functional and the fatal result due to\r\nshock of the nervous system. Fatal concussion does not, therefore,\r\nnecessitate the existence of compression or visible injury of the\r\nbrain. Concussion may sometimes be due to a violent fall upon the feet,\r\nin which case the shock is transmitted through the spinal column to\r\nthe head with or without fracture of the base of the skull. It was in\r\nthis way that the Duke of Orleans, the son of Louis Philippe, died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—Fractures of the Skull caused by a Four-sided\r\nHammer. One caused by the Corner, the Other by the End of the Head of\r\nthe Hammer. ¼ natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Four-sided Fracture caused by a Hatchet-Shaped\r\nInstrument, the Edges Formed by Depression of the Broken Outer Table of\r\nthe Skull.]\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms of_ concussion show all degrees of severity. Thus the\r\ninjured person may become confused and giddy with or without falling,\r\nhe may become pallid and nauseated and may vomit, but after a short\r\nperiod he recovers gradually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—Fracture of Parietal Bone with Depression,\r\ncaused by the Blow of an Axe.]\r\n\r\nWith a more severe injury, with which there is generally some\r\nlaceration of the brain, the injured person falls and lies quiet\r\nand relaxed, apparently unconscious, though often he can be partly\r\nroused. Paralysis and anæsthesia are absent. The heart is feeble and\r\nfluttering, the skin cold and clammy. The pupils, as a rule, react\r\nto light, but otherwise vary considerably. Urine and fæces may be\r\npassed involuntarily. As he begins to regain consciousness, vomiting\r\nusually occurs. Consciousness usually returns within twenty-four or\r\nforty-eight hours, when headache and indisposition to exertion are\r\ncomplained of, and this may last for a long time. Occasionally the\r\nsymptoms instead of abating increase, and coma supervenes, often\r\nindicating meningitis, encephalitis, or intracranial hemorrhage. In\r\nother cases the person may die almost immediately on the spot where he\r\nfell, while in still others apparent recovery takes place and death\r\noccurs later either suddenly or after a reappearance of symptoms.\r\nIn such cases, _abscess of the brain_ may occur and be the cause of\r\nthe fatal result. These abscesses are the result of the injury, which\r\nmay be almost anything from a compound fracture to a slight contusion\r\nnot leaving any scar. The abscess may occur within a week[661] or not\r\nuntil after months or years. This interval of apparent recovery may\r\nlead to the false supposition that death was not due to the injury,\r\nbut to some intervening cause. It is well to bear in mind that about\r\nhalf of the cases of abscess of the brain are not traumatic. A large\r\nmajority of these are due to suppuration in the middle ear, a few to\r\nseptic diseases or tuberculosis. The situation of the abscess often\r\ndistinguishes between the traumatic and non-traumatic varieties. The\r\ntraumatic variety is usually found beneath the injury or sometimes\r\ndirectly opposite, where the brain is injured by a kind of focussing\r\nof the radiated effects of the blow. The cases of abscess of the brain\r\ndue to ear disease are usually found in the temporal lobe of the brain\r\nlying over the position of the ear or in the cerebellum behind it.\r\nThe uncertainty of the nature and the extent of the cerebral injury\r\nin so-called contusion of the brain renders it necessary to be very\r\ncareful in giving a _prognosis_. Any injury should be considered\r\nserious which has produced unconsciousness, for such an injury may\r\nproduce enough laceration of the brain to render serious danger\r\npossible or even probable. We have seen that as a rule the symptoms\r\nof concussion come on immediately, but it is possible that symptoms\r\nat first so slight as to escape notice may become serious in a few\r\nhours or days. A gradual hemorrhage may sometimes account for this.\r\nThe knowledge of certain acts performed or a conversation held at the\r\nlast moment before the injury may be retained after recovery from\r\nconcussion of the brain. This is not necessarily the case, for instead\r\nof remembering up to the moment of the injury, the injured person may\r\nremember only up to a certain time shortly before, or a part and not\r\neverything may be remembered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Wounds of the Vault of the Cranium caused by\r\nArtillery Side-Arms, followed by Death shortly after.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _diagnosis_ of concussion of the brain _from alcoholism_ is\r\nsometimes a matter of medico-legal interest or importance. Concussion\r\nmay be so slight as to simulate intoxication. The history often clears\r\nthe case up. The history of a blow or a fall or the presence of marks\r\nof violence on the head indicates concussion, though the blow or fall\r\nmay not have caused the symptoms, which may be due to alcoholism. The\r\nodor of the breath may indicate alcoholism, but here too we may have\r\nboth present and the concussion may be responsible for the symptoms.\r\nOr again the alcohol may have been given as a heart stimulant after\r\nthe accident. This combination often occurs. If there is no odor in\r\nthe breath, the presumption is in favor of concussion. As mistakes are\r\nstill not infrequently made in diagnosis, those cases in which there\r\nis any ground for doubt should be carefully watched for developments.\r\nIn general, the existence of concussion is more often overlooked than\r\nthe coexisting alcoholism, so that if there is any doubt in a given\r\ncase it should be treated as one of cerebral injury. The injury which\r\ncauses the concussion in such cases is often due to the alcoholism. We\r\nmay be able to verify this supposition if the injury is such as would\r\nbe likely to be caused by a fall. There may be nothing found in the\r\nbrain after death to distinguish between concussion and alcoholism. A\r\nbruise on the head only indicates a probability of concussion, for the\r\nbruise and alcoholism may both be present, the former perhaps due to\r\nthe latter. The presence of alcohol in the stomach would indicate the\r\nexistence of alcoholism.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of an injury which has caused concussion of the brain\r\nis an _extravasation_ or _effusion of blood_. Extravasation of blood\r\nin or on the brain is one of the commonest causes of death from injury\r\nto the head. It may occur with or without marks of external injury. A\r\nperson suffering from such an extravasation of blood may recover from\r\nthe first effects of the injury, and at a varying time afterward the\r\nsymptoms may return and increase so as to result fatally. In such a\r\ncase the opening of the bleeding vessel may have become plugged until\r\nsome exertion, emotion, or excitement on the part of the injured person\r\nhas loosened the plug. A hemorrhage may have ceased from partial\r\nsyncope and return with a stronger heart action due perhaps to the\r\nadministration of alcohol. This effusion may occur on the surface of\r\nthe brain in connection with a superficial laceration of the brain or\r\njust beneath or outside the dura mater and not involving the brain\r\ndirectly. The latter cases are almost always due to the effects of\r\nviolence, though there is at least one case of apparently spontaneous\r\nrupture of the middle meningeal artery. The violence which causes\r\na rupture of the branches of this artery may be so slight as to\r\nleave no bruise or so severe as to cause fracture of the skull. The\r\nmost important symptom of such extradural hemorrhage is a period of\r\nconsciousness after recovery from the first effects of the injury,\r\nthen stupor may appear and deepen into coma. A subdural hemorrhage may\r\ncause almost the same symptoms, though the injury is usually such as\r\nhas produced a depressed fracture. This hemorrhage is most often due\r\nto the rupture of a number of small vessels under the fracture, though\r\nif one larger vessel is ruptured it is most often the middle cerebral.\r\nA thin layer of hemorrhage in connection with a superficial laceration\r\nof the brain is of frequent occurrence with or without the other two\r\nforms of intracranial hemorrhage. If the brain is lacerated we may have\r\nconvulsions in addition to other symptoms. Death occurring during or\r\nsoon after a prize-fight may occur from some of the above classes of\r\nintracranial extravasations. It may be questioned whether the blows or\r\na fall caused the hemorrhage. It is generally due to a fall in such\r\ncases, but may be due to blows, but the guilt is the same unless the\r\nfall was accidental. As the result of severe traumatism the vessels of\r\nthe interior of the cerebrum may be ruptured or hemorrhage may occur\r\ninto the ventricles of the brain. In such cases the symptoms will\r\nresemble those of ordinary apoplexy, only the cause is different from\r\nthe latter and the injury is usually so severe as to leave no doubt as\r\nto the existence of a traumatism. The following question may arise in\r\ncases of intracranial hemorrhage and especially in the latter class of\r\nsuch cases, _i.e._, in cerebral hemorrhage:\r\n\r\nWAS THE EXTRAVASATION OF BLOOD DUE TO DISEASE OR VIOLENCE?—It may\r\nbe alleged in defence that the hemorrhage was the natural result\r\nof disease. Where the hemorrhage is extradural or subdural or in\r\nconnection with a superficial laceration of the brain, the cause is\r\nalmost always traumatic. We have referred to one case of extradural\r\nhemorrhage from spontaneous rupture of the middle meningeal\r\nartery.[662] Subdural hemorrhage may occur from _Pachymeningitis\r\nhæmorrhagica interna_, but this condition is readily diagnosed on\r\npost-mortem examination and often with considerable certainty during\r\nlife. A history of alcoholism, headache, impaired intellect, unsteady\r\ngait, occasional losses of consciousness, stupor increasing to coma,\r\netc., indicates such a condition.\r\n\r\nIt is in cases of cerebral hemorrhage that there is the most difficulty\r\nin discriminating between that due to disease and that due to injury.\r\nIt may be alleged that the hemorrhage was from diseased vessels, or\r\nthat the effects of a blow, which cannot be denied, were aggravated by\r\ndisease of the cerebral vessels or by excitement due to intoxication or\r\npassion. Cerebral hemorrhage from disease is rare before 40 years of\r\nage, except in alcoholics. When the hemorrhage is due to disease the\r\nblood-vessels are diseased. The most frequent site of such hemorrhages\r\nis the course of the lenticulo-striate artery in the ganglia of the\r\nbase or the white substance of the centrum ovale.\r\n\r\nWhen injury is the cause of the hemorrhage it is usually found beneath\r\nthe point injured or directly opposite to this. External signs of the\r\nblow are generally visible if it be severe enough to cause a cerebral\r\nhemorrhage. The vessels may be perfectly healthy and the victim quite\r\nyoung if the hemorrhage is due to an injury, also the ruptured vessels\r\nmay be plainly torn. The most difficult cases are those where there\r\nis the history of an injury and at the same time such a condition of\r\ndisease of the cerebral vessels, etc., as would account for spontaneous\r\nhemorrhage. Where the injury was slight in the case of alcoholics or\r\naged people the medical witness should be especially careful in stating\r\nthat a cerebral hemorrhage was due to the injury. Then, too, in the act\r\nof falling from the occurrence of a cerebral hemorrhage due to disease\r\nthe head may be injured and show marks of violence. It should be borne\r\nin mind that an injury to the head may be inflicted when disease of the\r\nbrain, vessels, or membranes already exists. In such a case a slight\r\nblow might cause extensive hemorrhage, but as that which accelerates\r\ncauses, death, even though it might sooner or later have occurred in\r\nthe same manner without injury, is due to the injury inflicted.\r\n\r\nFrom the above considerations we see that spontaneous cerebral\r\nhemorrhage and that due to disease are not always easily distinguished\r\nfrom that due to violence. In severe injuries the structure of the\r\nbrain is plainly bruised, etc., but the greatest difficulty exists in\r\ncases of slight violence where arteritis of the cerebral blood-vessels\r\ncoexists. The spontaneous extravasation of blood in or upon the brain\r\nfrom excitement does not usually occur except with diseased vessels,\r\nold age, or alcoholism. It is rare, therefore, in the young and\r\nhealthy. If there is any doubt as to the origin of the hemorrhage, the\r\nmedical witness should state the cause most probable in his judgment.\r\nTaylor[663] supposes the case of a man excited by passion, alcohol,\r\nor both, who becomes insensible and dies after being struck a blow so\r\nslight that it would not have affected a healthy person. If examination\r\nreveals a quantity of blood effused into the substance of the brain,\r\nthere can be little doubt in the mind of the medical man that the\r\nexcitement was the principal cause of the effusion. On the other hand,\r\nif a severe blow or a violent fall on the head had been received in a\r\npersonal conflict with another and it is found that death was due to an\r\neffusion of blood upon the surface, there can be little doubt in the\r\nmind of the medical examiner that death was due to the blow, which\r\nwould satisfactorily account for the conditions found without reference\r\nto coexisting excitement, etc. In fact, in all cases where a question\r\nis raised as to the cause of the hemorrhage, it is most important to\r\nconsider whether the violence was not sufficient to account for the\r\nhemorrhage without the coexistence of disease or excitement. It is\r\nalso most important to bear in mind that after severe injuries, as\r\nafter a fall, causing extensive fracture of the skull, followed or not\r\nwith extravasation of blood, the injured person may walk about and die\r\nsome distance from the place of the accident and where no chance for\r\na similar accident exists. In this way the suspicion of murder may be\r\noccasioned, as illustrated in the following case cited by Taylor:[664]\r\nA man was accused of the murder of his companion, who was found dead in\r\na stable with fracture of the temporal bone which had caused rupture of\r\nthe middle meningeal artery. The accused stated that the deceased had\r\nbeen injured by falling from his horse the day before. After the fall,\r\nhowever, the deceased had gone into a public-house, where he remained\r\nsome time drinking before returning to the stable. The extravasation\r\nhad here taken place gradually, as is characteristic of hemorrhage from\r\nthe middle meningeal artery, and perhaps the excitement due to the\r\ndrinking had influenced it.\r\n\r\nTHE DATE OF AN EFFUSION OF BLOOD may sometimes be a matter of\r\nimportance in determining whether a given extravasation of blood in or\r\non the brain was caused by a recent blow or had existed previously. The\r\ncolor and consistence of these effusions indicate whether they are old\r\nor recent; the precise date we cannot state, but the information we\r\ncan give is often all that is required. The color of recent effusions\r\nis red, which changes after some days to a chocolate or brown, which\r\ngenerally turns to an ochre color (see Plate I.). This latter color\r\nmay be met with from twelve to twenty-five days after the injury. The\r\nconsistence of the coagula also becomes firmer with age, and as the\r\ncoagula become firmer they are more or less laminated and the expressed\r\nlymph may lie between the laminæ or around the coagula.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE—PLATE I.\r\n\r\nEXTRAVASATIONS IN SEVERAL PORTIONS OF THE ARACHNOID, WITH HEMORRHAGES\r\nIN NEIGHBORING PORTIONS OF THE BRAIN. DEATH IN FOUR DAYS.\r\n\r\nCEREBRAL ABSCESS. EPILEPSY, PARESIS. DEATH 3¼ YEARS AFTER THE INJURY.\r\n\r\nRECENT AND OLD CEREBRAL EFFUSIONS.]\r\n\r\nOn account of the many layers of the brain coverings, a rough diagram\r\nof the coverings as given by Taylor[1] may be of much use to the\r\nmedical expert in illustrating his evidence so as to make it clear to\r\nthe court (see Fig. 19).\r\n\r\n=Wounds of the brain= vary very widely in their immediate results\r\naccording to the part of the brain injured. Thus sometimes a slight\r\nwound of the brain may be instantly fatal and often a severe wound in\r\nanother part is not so. Extensive wounds may occur especially in the\r\nfrontal lobes with remarkably slight disturbance. If a person with a\r\nwound of the brain survives the first effects of the injury the danger\r\nof inflammation remains. This danger may not be removed for a long\r\ntime, for the inflammation may develop very slowly, not showing itself\r\nfor from three to ten weeks or even later. Thus Taylor[665] cites\r\nthe case of a child who was accidentally shot through the brain. The\r\nsymptoms of inflammation did not appear until the twenty-sixth day and\r\ndeath occurred on the twenty-ninth day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—Diagramatic Representation of the Skull and\r\nMembranes of the Brain for Exhibition in Court. _a_, Skull with outer\r\nand inner tables and diploë; _b_, dura mater; _c_, arachnoid membrane;\r\n_d_, pia mater.]\r\n\r\n=Wounds of the face= heal remarkably well on account of its great\r\nvascularity. If severe they may leave great deformity or disfigurement,\r\nwhich may be the ground of a civil suit and thus require the testimony\r\nof a medical expert. If the wound involves the orbit or its contents it\r\nmay be more serious, either from a fracture of the thin upper or inner\r\nwall of the orbit, separating it from the brain, or from extension of\r\na secondary inflammation of the contents of the orbit to the brain.\r\nWounds of the eyebrow may cause supra-orbital neuralgia or amaurosis\r\nfrom paralysis of the upper lid. Some fractures of the nose, especially\r\nthose due to severe injury near the root of the nose, may be more\r\nserious than they appear. For in such cases, of which the writer has\r\nseen several, the fracture is not confined to the nose, but involves\r\nalso the ethmoid bone and its cribriform plate forming part of the base\r\nof the skull. In such a case a fatal meningitis is a common result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—Double Fracture of the Thyroid and Cricoid\r\nCartilages of the Larynx, from the Blow of a Flat-Iron.]\r\n\r\n=Wounds of the neck= are very rarely accidental, more often homicidal,\r\nbut most often suicidal. In nature they are most often incised wounds.\r\nAs we have already seen, the kind and condition of the weapon used is\r\noften indicated by the character of the wound. We have also seen that\r\nin many cases a suicidal wound of the neck can be distinguished from a\r\nhomicidal one with more or less probability or even certainty. Wounds\r\nof the neck are often dangerous, and they may be rapidly fatal if they\r\ndivide the main vessels, especially the carotid arteries. Wounds of the\r\nlarynx, trachea, and œsophagus are grave and often fatal from entrance\r\nof blood into the air-passages or from subsequent œdema or inflammation\r\noccluding the air-passages. Wounds of the sympathetic and pneumogastric\r\nnerves may be fatal, and those of the recurrent laryngeal nerves cause\r\naphonia. The situation of the average suicidal or homicidal cut-throat\r\nwound is in front, generally across the thyro-hyoid membrane, sometimes\r\ndividing the cricoid-thyroid membrane, and not at the side of the neck\r\nwhere the great vessels lie and would be more easily divided. The\r\nforce is expended, as a rule, before the great vessels are reached.\r\nThe epiglottis may be cut or detached and the incision may even reach\r\nthe posterior wall of the pharynx, but the majority of the suicidal\r\ncases recover with proper treatment. The homicidal cases are more often\r\nfatal from division of the great vessels, though, as already stated, in\r\neither class of cases a fatal result may occur if the air-passages are\r\nopened from the entrance of blood into them and the consequent asphyxia.\r\n\r\nCONTUSIONS of the neck may be so severe as to cause unconsciousness\r\nor even death. The latter may be due to a reflex inhibitory action,\r\nas in cases of death from a blow upon the pit of the stomach. As a\r\nresult of such contusions we may have a fracture of the larynx usually\r\nconfined to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages (see Fig. 20). This\r\nmay be followed by hemorrhage from the larynx, some of which may\r\npass down into the trachea and threaten death from asphyxia. Later\r\nemphysema often develops throughout the tissues of the neck, and there\r\nis great danger of œdema of the larynx. The prognosis is serious unless\r\ntracheotomy is performed early or the case is closely watched. It is\r\nmost serious where the cricoid cartilage had been fractured, as this\r\nrequires a greater degree of violence. Whereas incised wounds of the\r\nthroat are most often suicidal, contusions are most often accidental\r\nor inflicted by another. Among the latter class of injuries may be\r\nincluded the so-called _garroting_, by which a person is seized\r\nviolently around the throat, usually from behind, and generally with a\r\nview to strangle and rob. In such cases the larynx or trachea may be\r\ninjured in the same way as by a contusing blow.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS AND INJURIES OF THE SPINE AND SPINAL CORD.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the spine resemble more or less closely those of the\r\nhead. FRACTURES OF THE SPINE generally occur in combination with\r\ndislocation, as fracture-dislocation. Thus displacement is generally\r\npresent and causes a fatal compression or crushing of the cord. When\r\nthe cord has once been crushed at the site of the displacement of the\r\nfracture-dislocation there is no hope of its ever healing. Therefore\r\nthe lower end of the cord is never again in functional connection with\r\nthe brain. These injuries are more rapidly fatal the higher up they\r\nare. If the injury is above the fourth cervical vertebra death is\r\nnearly immediate, for then even diaphragmatic breathing is impossible,\r\nand the injured person dies of asphyxia. Fracture of the odontoid\r\nprocess of the axis, which regularly occurs in hanging, may occur\r\nfrom falls on the head, etc., and is not always immediately fatal.\r\nThus in one case[666] the person lived fifteen months and in another\r\ncase sixteen months. In the latter case the fracture was due to the\r\npatient turning in bed while his head was pressed on the pillow. In\r\nsome cases it may be questioned how far this injury may result from\r\ndisease of the bones or ligaments. Therefore a careful examination of\r\nthese parts should be made after death, which will usually enable\r\nus to answer this question, which may be brought up by the defence.\r\nIt is hardly necessary for our purpose to enumerate the symptoms of\r\nfracture-dislocation of the spine. Of course the patients are almost\r\nalways unable to walk and so are bed-ridden. A marked feature of\r\nfracture-dislocation of the spine is the length of time intervening\r\nbetween the injury and the fatal termination, and yet the injury is\r\nwholly responsible for the death of the injured person. This delay may\r\nlast for months or even for years with careful treatment. But sooner or\r\nlater the case generally ends fatally, though not necessarily so. Where\r\nthe cord has been entirely crushed the result is almost always fatal;\r\nwhere the cord is not so injured recovery may and often does occur.\r\nAccording to Lutaud, fractures of the spine are sometimes followed\r\nby secondary paralysis coming on after healing of the fracture. At the\r\noutset we can seldom give a definite _prognosis_, which can only be\r\ngiven after watching the developments of the case. The prognosis is\r\nmore favorable in fracture of the arches alone or when the injury is in\r\nthe lower part of the spine and not very severe. The commonest cause\r\nof fracture-dislocation of the spine is forced flexion of the spinal\r\ncolumn. Injuries to the spine are generally the result of falls or\r\nblows on the spine, especially in its lower part. Lutaud[667] states\r\nthat after forced flexion of the spine without fracture paraplegia may\r\nsometimes occur, which is attributed to forced elongation of the cord.\r\nThis paraplegia, which may seem to be grave, is completely recovered\r\nfrom as a rule.\r\n\r\nIncised or punctured wounds of the spinal cord are rare, as it is so\r\nwell protected except in the very highest part behind. Here between\r\nthe occiput and the atlas and between the latter and the axis, and to\r\na less extent between the axis and the third cervical vertebra, the\r\ncord is more exposed, owing to the narrowness of the laminæ. It is here\r\nthat _pithing_ is done, which is almost instantly fatal, as the medulla\r\noblongata and upper part of the spinal cord are the parts injured,\r\nand they contain the respiratory and other vital centres. Pithing may\r\nbe done with such a small needle-like instrument as to leave scarcely\r\nany trace. Only a slightly bloody streak may persist, which may appear\r\nsuperficial if the instrument is introduced obliquely. Such a mark\r\nin this location with no other apparent cause of death should always\r\nlead to an examination of the upper part of the cord, which will\r\nalways reveal the cause of death in such cases. Pithing is practised\r\nespecially in infanticide.\r\n\r\nAs with the brain, so with the spinal cord, we may have CONCUSSION due\r\nto the shock of a contusing blow. Concussion of the spinal cord, as of\r\nthe brain, may be fatal without showing scarcely a mark of violence\r\nexternally or internally. As the cord is so well protected from injury,\r\nit must be extremely rare to have concussion of the cord without some\r\nactual lesion of its substance. As concussion of the cord is not often\r\nthe result of the injuries of which we are treating, but rather of\r\nrailroad injuries and the like, it will not be considered at length\r\nin this connection. As a result of a blow or fall on the spine or\r\ncommunicated to it, hemorrhage may occur in the substance of the cord\r\nor around it between or outside its membranes. In very rare cases such\r\na hemorrhage may occur spontaneously as the result of disease, of which\r\nthe writer has seen one case. It may be associated with concussion\r\nor laceration of the cord. It may destroy life directly by extension\r\nor indirectly by leading to a spreading inflammation. Hemorrhage in\r\nor about the cord causes a gradual compression of the cord, and in\r\ncases of fracture of the spine often adds to the compression due to\r\nthe displacement of the bones. In hemorrhage into the substance of the\r\ncord paralysis comes on early or immediately and may be complete while\r\nsymptoms of irritation fail. The latter symptoms are most marked in\r\nmeningeal hemorrhage in which paralysis is delayed in appearance and\r\ngenerally incomplete. The products of an inflammation due to an injury\r\nmay compress the spinal cord in the same way that hemorrhage does.\r\n\r\nWounds and injuries of the varieties we are considering, affecting the\r\nspine and spinal cord, are generally accidental, less often homicidal,\r\nand almost never suicidal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE THORAX AND THORACIC ORGANS.\r\n\r\n=Wounds of the thorax caused by incising, puncturing, or blunt\r\ninstruments.= These wounds are most often punctured wounds; contused\r\nwounds are common and incised wounds are not rare. They are perhaps\r\nmost often homicidal in origin or at least inflicted by another, and\r\nthe accidental origin of these wounds is probably the least common.\r\n\r\nIncised or punctured non-penetrating wounds of the thoracic wall are\r\nrarely grave. Bleeding, as a rule, is not serious, though it may be\r\nquite free. Such wounds may be accompanied by emphysema, though not\r\npenetrating, owing to the movements of the chest and a valve-like\r\naction of the edges of the wound. Contused wounds of the thorax are\r\nmore dangerous, especially if the violence was great, owing to the\r\ncomplicating fracture of the ribs, rupture of the thoracic viscera, etc.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE RIBS is a common result of contusions of the chest.\r\nIt is more dangerous when due to a direct blow or injury, as then the\r\nsplintering occurs internally and may wound the lungs, heart, or large\r\nvessels, while with fracture from indirect violence, from compression\r\nof the chest, the splintering of the ribs occurs externally. Fracture\r\nof the upper ribs requires more force than that required to fracture\r\nthe lower ones, and consequently the former is the more dangerous. The\r\ndiagnosis of fracture of the ribs is generally quite easy by means of\r\ncrepitus felt or heard, false motion, local tenderness, etc. FRACTURE\r\nOF THE STERNUM may be serious if depressed on account of the wounding\r\nof the viscera behind it. Devergie[668] cites such a case where the\r\ndepressed portion of the sternum produced a transverse non-penetrating\r\nwound of the heart about an inch in length, which had caused death in\r\nthirteen days. Simple fracture of the sternum without displacement of\r\nthe fragments is rarely serious unless injury of the thoracic viscera\r\nis produced by the same violence. Wounds or injuries of the thorax\r\nare grave or not according as they penetrate or injure the thoracic\r\nviscera or do not do so. A wound may just penetrate the thoracic wall\r\nwithout wounding the thoracic viscera, and is then serious as a rule\r\nonly when followed by inflammation. In fact, many of the penetrating\r\nwounds of the thorax wounding the viscera are only grave on account\r\nof consecutive inflammation. We have already seen that various\r\ncharacteristics of wounds of the thorax, especially of stab-wounds,\r\nenable us to determine the kind of weapon used, its size, sharpness,\r\netc., and sometimes to identify the weapon itself. In much the same way\r\nwe can often determine whether the wound was suicidally or homicidally\r\ninflicted. The cause of death in wounds of the thorax may be directly\r\ndue to the wounding of one or more of the thoracic viscera, or it\r\nmay be due to the inflammation occasioned by it. Wounds of the lower\r\npart of the thorax may involve at the same time the thoracic cavity\r\nproper and its contained viscera, the diaphragm and the abdomen and\r\nits viscera. This is the order in which the different parts would\r\nbe met with in a wound from behind forward; the order might be the\r\nreverse of this in a wound from before backward. Penetrating wounds\r\nof the thorax may involve the lungs, heart, or great blood-vessels.\r\nOf these, the lungs are most often injured, which is easily accounted\r\nfor by the greater size of the lungs. In =wounds of the lungs= the\r\nimmediate danger is from hemorrhage. The hemorrhage appears externally\r\nthrough the wound and from the mouth, being coughed up. Where the\r\nlungs are injured by a blow, fall, or crush without external injury,\r\nblood appears in the mouth only. The blood coughed up from the lungs\r\nis bright red and frothy, and it may also be frothy at the external\r\nwound. Hemorrhage from the external wound may be slight, especially if\r\nthe wound is oblique and acts as a valve. In wounds of the lungs most\r\nof the blood may collect in the pleura or in the lungs, and thus, by\r\ncompression from without or by displacement by the blood within it,\r\nprevents air from entering the lungs and produces asphyxia, which may\r\nbe fatal. More or less dyspnœa usually occurs at first. Emphysema is\r\ngenerally present in the cellular tissues, but this latter symptom\r\nmay also occur at times with non-penetrating wounds of the chest. If\r\ndeath does not occur speedily from hemorrhage by compression of the\r\nlungs or heart, there are good hopes of saving the patient, but the\r\nprognosis should be reserved. For even when the first effects of the\r\nwound of the lung are survived, the patient may die from the effects\r\nof inflammation, recurring hemorrhage, or a too sudden relaxation of\r\nregimen. Thus, for instance, if too much food, talking, or exertion are\r\nindulged in the case may on this account terminate fatally, and such\r\naggravating causes of death may mitigate the sentence.\r\n\r\n=Wounds of the heart= are among the most fatal. Although it was once\r\nconsidered, and is usually thought now by laymen, that wounds of\r\nthe heart must be necessarily and instantly fatal, the facts are\r\notherwise. If the wound is small and oblique life may be prolonged,\r\nand cases are recorded[669] in which wounds of the heart were not\r\ndirectly fatal, and in some of which recovery would have probably\r\nresulted if not for other diseases. Cases in which the heart wall\r\nwas wounded but not penetrated, and in which healing took place,\r\nare not very rare.[670] Thus Callender removed a needle from the\r\nsubstance of the heart. But there is perhaps only one case[671] on\r\nrecord in which a wound penetrating the cavities of the heart was\r\nrecovered from. It is the rule rather than the exception that wounds\r\nof the heart, penetrating or not, are not immediately fatal. Thus\r\nin a series of twenty-nine cases of penetrating wounds mentioned by\r\nDevergie,[672] as collected by Ollivier and Sanson, only two ended\r\nfatally within forty-eight hours, the rest in periods ranging from\r\nfour to twenty-eight days. This delay in the fatal result has been\r\nattributed to the arrangement of the muscle fibres crossing one another\r\nand tending to close the wound, or at least to make it smaller. As to\r\nthe various parts of the heart wounded, the right side, especially\r\nthe ventricle, is most often wounded. Thus out of fifty-four cases\r\nof wounds of the heart, Taylor[673] states that the right ventricle\r\nwas wounded in twenty-nine cases, both ventricles in nine, the right\r\nauricle in three, and the left auricle in one case. This greater\r\nfrequency of wounds of the right side of the heart is easily accounted\r\nfor by its more exposed position anteriorly, just beneath the chest\r\nwall in a part of its extent. The rapidity of death depends largely\r\nupon the site and extent of the wound. Lutaud[674] states that out of\r\ntwenty-four cases of wounds of the right ventricle only two were fatal\r\nwithin forty-eight hours, and out of twelve cases of wounds of the left\r\nventricle three were not immediately fatal. Wounds of the auricles are\r\ngenerally fatal immediately, especially if the cavity is extensively\r\nlaid open. It is the general opinion that wounds of the auricles are\r\nmost rapidly fatal, next those of the right ventricle, and lastly\r\nthose of the left ventricle. This difference is probably due to the\r\ncomparative thickness of the walls of these parts. Thus the wall of\r\nthe left ventricle is so thick as to tend to close a wound unless it\r\nbe extensive. In wounds of the heart death rarely occurs from external\r\nhemorrhage, which may be quite slight or even altogether wanting where\r\nthe wound is due to a crush or fracture of the ribs. Death is usually\r\ndue to the compression of the heart by the blood in the pericardium.\r\nThis usually causes syncope, or a slighter pressure may be fatal by\r\ncausing cerebral or pulmonary anæmia or shock. Death may occur suddenly\r\nin this manner or not until after some time. Thus in penetrating\r\nstab-wounds little or no blood probably escapes at first, in most\r\ncases, but it may ooze or, later on, suddenly burst out into the\r\npericardium. Therefore after a wound of the heart the patient does not,\r\nas a rule, die immediately, as formerly and often at the present time\r\nerroneously supposed. This fact is of little importance as a rule in\r\nsurgery, for the patients generally die sooner or later, but it is of\r\nimportance in medical jurisprudence, for upon it may hang the solution\r\nof questions of murder, suicide, or justifiable homicide. It also\r\naccounts for the fact that the injured person can exercise voluntary\r\npower after the injury. Thus Watson[675] met with a case where a man\r\nran eighteen yards and died six hours after a stab-wound of the right\r\nventricle. The coronary artery was divided and the pericardium was\r\nfilled with blood. Also Boileau met with an accidental penetrating\r\nstab-wound through both ventricles in a soldier who ran two hundred\r\nyards, then fell and died in five minutes. A boy admitted to Guy’s\r\nHospital in 1879 lived forty-two hours with a bayonet-wound transfixing\r\nthe right auricle, the septum, the left ventricle, the mitral valve,\r\nand entering the left auricle.\r\n\r\nMinute wounds of the chest are sometimes made by needles, etc., in the\r\nregion of the heart with the intention of killing infants or children.\r\nTaylor[676] also mentions the case of a fatal wound of the heart from\r\na needle, the result of accident. We have already cited the case of a\r\nneedle lodged in the heart wall and removed by Callender by operation.\r\nThat the puncture of the heart by a small instrument is not necessarily\r\nserious is proved by the experiments of Senn,[677] by which he found\r\nthat “the heart can be punctured with a perfectly aseptic, medium-sized\r\naspirator needle without any great immediate or remote danger.”\r\n\r\nIn cases of RUPTURE OF THE HEART the question may come up as to whether\r\nit was the result of disease or violence. We have already seen that\r\nrupture of the heart may occur from falls or crushes without marks of\r\nviolence to the chest. In general, we may say that in rupture of the\r\nheart from violence the right side and base are most often involved,\r\nwhile in rupture from disease the left ventricle is generally ruptured,\r\nespecially near the apex. The exciting causes of rupture of a diseased\r\nheart are often violent emotions or exertion, which may both be present\r\nin a quarrel with another and cause rupture without direct violence.\r\nThe cause need be but slight if the heart is diseased, whether the\r\ncause is a natural one or outward violence. Rupture from disease may\r\ntherefore excite suspicions of murder, but those cases can usually be\r\nsatisfactorily solved by examination of the organ post mortem. A slight\r\ndegree of violence may cause rupture of a diseased heart about ready\r\nfor rupture from natural causes. When a diseased heart ruptures during\r\na quarrel, the symptoms of rupture of the heart may be observed to come\r\non suddenly before and without the infliction of any violence.\r\n\r\n=Wounds of Arteries and Veins=, especially within the thorax.—Wounds\r\nof large trunks are generally speedily mortal. In the chest we may\r\noccasionally meet with wounds of the intercostal or internal mammary\r\nvessels or the vena azygos veins. These wounds are often serious and\r\nmay be fatal. We have already seen that blood in the large cavities of\r\nthe body, like the chest, is commonly not coagulated, or at least the\r\ngreater part of it. We have already seen, too, that after wounds of the\r\ncarotid artery the victim may preserve the power of locomotion for a\r\nshort time, but not the power of struggling. This fact may be important\r\nto help distinguish between murder and suicide. In such wounds of the\r\ncarotid the voice may be lost, as the trachea is often divided. Death\r\nfrom wounds of large vessels may be due to loss of blood, and if this\r\ndanger is passed the case may still terminate fatally, as in a case\r\nwhere the brachial was tied for injury and death occurred in three days\r\nfrom gangrene. The wounds of comparatively small vessels may prove\r\nfatal from hemorrhage, etc.\r\n\r\nIn wounds of blood-vessels death may occur from the _entrance of air_\r\ninto them. In some cases where this is supposed to have occurred it is\r\nquite probable that death was really due to hemorrhage. A considerable\r\nquantity of air may enter the circulation, especially the arterial\r\ncirculation, without a fatal result. When death does occur it is owing\r\n(1) to “mechanical over-distention of the right ventricle of the heart\r\nand paralysis in the diastole,” or (2) to “asphyxia from obstruction\r\nto the pulmonary circulation consequent upon embolism of the pulmonary\r\nartery.”[678] Senn found that fatal air embolism could hardly occur\r\nspontaneously in a healthy jugular vein, as the walls collapse readily\r\nfrom atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\n=Wounds and Ruptures of the Diaphragm.=—These may be due to weapons,\r\nfracture of the ribs, falls or crushes, and disease. They also occur\r\nas the result of congenital malformation, though these cases seldom\r\nsurvive long. These injuries are generally homicidal or accidental in\r\norigin. As a rule, the viscera are wounded at the same time, or, if not\r\nwounded, at least herniated, and may thus become strangulated. It is\r\ntherefore hard to estimate the danger in such cases, but the prognosis\r\nis at all times serious. The most serious cases of such injury to the\r\ndiaphragm are due to violent contusions or falls when the stomach and\r\nintestines are full. The hemorrhage is usually slight, but hernia of\r\none or more of the abdominal viscera usually occurs in such cases,\r\nand is said to be more readily produced during inspiration when the\r\nfibres are on the stretch. According to Devergie, rupture of the\r\ndiaphragm with hernia is more common on the left side in the central\r\ntendon in front of the crura and at the junction of the left muscular\r\nleaflet. Also on either side of the ensiform cartilage and especially\r\non the left side there occurs an area of the diaphragm which may be\r\ncongenitally weak or even absent, and here too rupture and hernia are\r\nlikely to occur. _Phrenic_ or _diaphragmatic hernia_ occurs especially\r\nafter lacerated wounds, even after the wounds have apparently healed.\r\nIf hernia occurs long after the injury was inflicted, it may be asked\r\nwhether the wound was the cause of the hernia, and so of death. This\r\ncan only be determined by examination. Almost any or all of the movable\r\nabdominal viscera may be found in a diaphragmatic hernia. It was once\r\nsupposed that this accident would be immediately fatal, but this is\r\nfar from the truth. Devergie relates the case where a person lived\r\nnine months with the stomach and colon in the chest and died from\r\nanother cause. Thus a person may have a phrenic hernia and die from\r\nanother cause, or having had a rupture or wound of the diaphragm he may\r\nsuddenly acquire a diaphragmatic hernia by reason of a blow or sudden\r\nexertion, or the latter may strangulate an existing hernia. A person\r\nwith a diaphragmatic hernia may have the power of moving or walking,\r\nbut is more or less incapacitated owing to the compression of the lungs\r\nwhich exists and the consequent dyspnœa, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS AND CONTUSED INJURIES OF THE ABDOMINAL WALL AND VISCERA.\r\n\r\nSuch wounds and injuries of the abdominal wall may be incised,\r\npunctured, or due to blunt instruments, etc. They are usually homicidal\r\nor accidental, seldom suicidal except in delirious patients or\r\nlunatics. The cause of death in such cases may be due to hemorrhage,\r\nshock, etc., or to secondary inflammation, which is especially likely\r\nto occur in penetrating wounds. The kind of weapon used may often\r\nbe judged from the nature of the wound. Incised and non-penetrating\r\npunctured wounds are usually simple and not grave, but may be otherwise\r\nfrom hemorrhage from the deep epigastric artery, or from inflammation\r\nin or between the muscles, or in the subperitoneal connective tissue.\r\nIn the latter case peritonitis may occur, but is rare. A ventral hernia\r\nmay, however, result later on, as also from a cicatrix, especially if\r\nit is transverse. In such cases the question arises whether the natural\r\nresults of the wound were aggravated by unskilful or improper treatment\r\nor even wilful neglect on the part of the patient or practitioner.\r\n\r\nCONTUSIONS of the abdomen are more serious often than those of the\r\nchest, for there is less power of resistance. We have already seen\r\nthat death may occur from a contusion of the abdomen too slight to show\r\na mark of ecchymosis or a serious injury internally. This has been\r\nattributed by some to an effect on the solar plexus or reflexly on\r\nthe cardiac plexus causing a fatal inhibition. Lutaud and others have\r\nexpressed the doubt whether the cases reported by Travers, Allison,\r\nWatson, Cooper, Vibert, and others were carefully examined, and have\r\ninferred that some visible organic change must have been present. Some\r\nsuch cases, however, have been examined with especial reference to this\r\npoint, and no physical injuries and no other cause of death elsewhere\r\nhas been found. There is no ground, therefore, for a jury to doubt that\r\na contusion of the abdomen was the cause of death because there are no\r\nvisible marks of injury.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is a well-known fact that the blows severe enough to cause\r\nrupture of the abdominal viscera may sometimes leave no trace of\r\nviolence in or on the abdominal wall. On the other hand, it must be\r\nremembered that effusions of blood may be found post mortem in the\r\nsheaths of muscles without indicating violence, so that blood may be\r\nfound effused in considerable quantity in and around the abdominal\r\nmuscles without violence having been done. In such cases, therefore, we\r\nshould note whether abrasions or ecchymoses of the skin are absent or\r\nnot. If they are absent and there is no other evidence of a blow, the\r\nmedical witness should hesitate to attribute such an effusion of blood\r\nbetween the muscles to an act of violence.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the chest, so wounds of the abdomen are serious, as\r\na rule, mainly as they involve the abdominal viscera. The viscera may\r\nbe wounded by a penetrating wound or by rupture, and the fatal result\r\nis due sometimes to internal hemorrhage or to shock, but generally to\r\nsecondary septic peritonitis, which may be fatal in a few hours or\r\nonly after days or weeks. Occasionally wounds of the abdominal viscera\r\nundergo spontaneous cure without surgical interference and with or\r\nwithout medical treatment. But as a rule they are fatal unless they\r\nreceive proper surgical treatment. A wound of the abdominal wall may\r\nbe penetrating without wounding any of the viscera. Such wounds may be\r\nfatal if they are infected, otherwise they usually heal readily and\r\nwithout danger unless they are extensive and the abdominal contents\r\nare exposed to the air. The gravity of penetrating wounds varies\r\nsomewhat with the particular viscus or viscera injured. It is well not\r\nto examine wounds of the abdomen by the finger or probe too freely\r\nunless a laparotomy is anticipated; for a simple wound or penetrating\r\nwound without wounding of the viscera may thus be infected. Enough\r\nexamination is necessary to diagnose between a simple and a penetrating\r\nwound of the abdominal wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OR WOUNDS OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA.\r\n\r\nTHE LIVER is most often wounded of any of the abdominal viscera, with\r\nthe possible exception of the intestines, because of its size, and it\r\nis most often ruptured partly because of its size, but mostly owing to\r\nits friable consistence. Such injuries most often involve the right\r\nlobe, as it is much the larger of the two principal lobes. The anterior\r\nsurface and inferior border is the most frequent site both of wounds\r\nand ruptures of the organ. Ruptures rarely pass entirely through\r\nthe organ, but are generally not more than an inch or two in depth.\r\nThey are usually directed antero-posteriorly or obliquely, rarely\r\ntransversely, and the lacerated granular edges are not much separated\r\nas a rule (see Fig. 21). Rupture of the liver may be due to a blow,\r\ncrush, or fall, or even to sudden muscular action if the organ is large\r\nand fatty. Thus Taylor[679] relates the case of a woman who died after\r\nchild-birth of uræmic convulsions, and in whom there was quite an\r\nextensive hemorrhage into the liver beneath its capsule, and apparently\r\ndue to violent muscular contraction. As we have already seen, the liver\r\nmay be ruptured without the abdomen showing the marks of external\r\nviolence. Rupture or wound of the liver is one of the causes of the\r\nfatality of wounds and injuries of the abdomen. The fatal result may\r\nbe and often is due to hemorrhage; in other cases it is due to shock\r\nor the occurrence of peritonitis. Wounds of the liver heal readily\r\nand hemorrhage is arrested at once, as a rule, by the approximation\r\nof the edges. There may be little blood in and about the wound, but\r\nit collects in the right iliac region or in the pelvis and is not\r\nwholly coagulated. Unless the wound or rupture involves the vena cava,\r\nportal vein, or a large branch of either of these, the hemorrhage is\r\napt to be slow and the victim may survive hours or even days, except\r\nfor active exertion or repeated violence. Two cases illustrating the\r\nslowness of the hemorrhage have occurred in Guy’s Hospital. In one[680]\r\nthe man, showing no urgent symptoms at the time, was sent away, and\r\ndied a few hours later in a police-station. In this case the liver was\r\nruptured nearly through its thickness, and a basinful of blood had\r\nbeen effused, causing death. In the other case,[681] which occurred\r\nto Wilks, the patient survived the accident ten days, and Taylor[682]\r\ncites a case which was reported to have ended fatally eight years after\r\nthe accident. As a rule the injury is fatal, without treatment, within\r\nforty-eight hours. Not being immediately fatal as a rule, the victim of\r\na rupture or wound of the liver can walk about, and may be capable of\r\nmore or less severe muscular exertion after the injury, though the fact\r\nof such exertion has sometimes been used by the defence to prove that\r\nthe rupture was not due to the particular violence in question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—Ruptures of the Liver from a Fall from a\r\nConsiderable Height, causing Immediate Death.]\r\n\r\n_Wounds and ruptures of the gall-bladder_ result in the effusion\r\nof bile. While rupture of the liver is not necessarily followed by\r\nperitonitis, rupture of the gall-bladder with the effusion of bile\r\ngenerally causes peritonitis, and is fatal in this way and not from\r\nhemorrhage. Rupture of the gall-bladder may be favored by the presence\r\nof gall-stones, but the result is still attributable to the injury.\r\n\r\nSPLEEN.—Ruptures of the spleen may be due to a bruising violence\r\nin this region, and here too the skin may not show the marks of the\r\ncontusion, though this fact is still employed by the defence to try\r\nto disprove the connection between the injury and the result. It is\r\nimportant to remember, from a medico-legal point of view, that an\r\nenlarged and softened spleen may be ruptured from a comparatively\r\nslight muscular exertion. This might occur in a sudden movement to\r\navoid a blow, and the charge of manslaughter might be affected by\r\nthe mode of the production of the injury and the previous abnormal\r\ncondition. Only direct violence is liable to rupture the healthy normal\r\nspleen. Rupture and wounds of the spleen may be and generally are fatal\r\nfrom hemorrhage, owing to the vascularity of the organ; more rarely are\r\nthey fatal from shock. Peritonitis is not a result to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe hemorrhage accumulates in the lower and left side of the abdomen or\r\nin the pelvis, and coagulation is imperfect if present at all.\r\n\r\nKIDNEYS.—These are occasionally ruptured from violence, but more often\r\nfrom accident. Wounds of the kidney are rare, owing to the depth from\r\nthe surface at which they lie. They are more accessible from behind. A\r\nwound from behind is generally extra-peritoneal unless it perforates\r\nthe organ; not so a wound from in front. Accidents in which the lumbar\r\nregion is forcedly flexed are most apt to be followed by injury to the\r\nkidney. The injury may cause no prominent symptoms, but usually lumbar\r\npain and tenderness, frequent micturition and hematuria, and in severe\r\ncases the symptoms of hemorrhage and shock are present. The injury may\r\nbe speedily fatal from hemorrhage or collapse, or more slowly fatal\r\nfrom peritonitis, when the peritoneum is involved, or from abscess\r\nand septic infection, or from uræmia if the other kidney is diseased.\r\nSlight injuries are generally recovered from. As is the case with the\r\nliver and spleen, so after injuries of the kidney the victim may walk\r\nabout, etc., unless there is copious and immediate hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nTHE BLADDER may be wounded directly through the hypogastrium, vagina,\r\nor rectum; it may be punctured by a broken fragment of the pelvis,\r\nespecially the pubis, or it may frequently be ruptured from blows,\r\ncrushes, or falls. The latter accident occurs especially where the\r\nbladder is distended. The bladder may also rupture spontaneously from\r\nover-distention, which may or may not be favored by disease of the\r\nbladder wall, in which case rupture occurs more easily. Medico-legally\r\nthe question may arise whether the rupture was spontaneous or due to\r\ninjury. In this connection it should be remembered that the injury may\r\nleave no external mark of violence, and a case is recorded in which the\r\nbladder was ruptured by a fall in wrestling; but the question can be\r\ndetermined only by an examination of the bladder. If the wall of the\r\nbladder is thinned by the pressure of a calculus or from other causes,\r\nor if it is weakened by tubercular, syphilitic, or carcinomatous\r\ndeposits or ulcerations, it may be spontaneously ruptured from\r\nslight distention or a slight degree of violence may rupture it. If\r\nviolence has been employed it is responsible for the rupture, though\r\nthe diseased condition may act as a mitigating circumstance; not so\r\na distended bladder, as the latter is not abnormal. In spontaneous\r\nrupture from over-distention without disease of the bladder wall,\r\nstricture, hypertrophied prostate, or some such condition must be\r\npresent to account for the over-distention. Spontaneous rupture of\r\nthe bladder can, therefore, only occur when either disease of the\r\nbladder wall or obstruction of the urethra is present. No condition\r\nexcludes rupture from violence. If there is an injury followed by\r\nthe symptoms of rupture of the bladder and death and the bladder and\r\nurethra are healthy, there can be little doubt that death was due to\r\nthe injury. Wounds or rupture of the bladder may be extra-peritoneal\r\nor intra-peritoneal. Rupture from disease of the bladder wall occurs\r\nat the site of the diseased and weakened spot, which is most often at\r\nthe base of the bladder. Rupture of the bladder from violence occurs\r\nmost often on the postero-superior wall, running downward from the\r\nurachus, in which case the peritoneum would be involved. A punctured\r\nwound of the bladder wall may be so minute that the leakage is very\r\nslow and the customary symptoms may be obscured, or the opening may be\r\nvalvular in character, perhaps allowing escape of urine only when the\r\nbladder is not distended. The _symptoms_ consist of pain, inability\r\nto micturate, and the presence of blood in the little fluid which can\r\nbe drawn by a catheter. Fluid injected is not all returned and the\r\nbladder cannot be distended. After a time varying from a few hours to\r\na few days, depending upon the size of the opening and the condition\r\nof the urine, peritonitis or peri-vesical cellulitis is set up, the\r\nformer being generally fatal, the latter not necessarily so. Prompt\r\nsurgical treatment may save the patient’s life by avoiding peritonitis.\r\nExtra-peritoneal ruptures are far less dangerous than intra-peritoneal,\r\nas in the former case cellulitis and abscess in the cellular tissue\r\naround the bladder, which may subsequently be treated by operation\r\nand drainage, take the place of peritonitis in the latter case, for\r\nwhich prevention is the only safe treatment. In extra-peritoneal\r\nrupture death, if it occurs, is generally due to septicæmia; in the\r\nintra-peritoneal variety it is due to peritonitis. These cases of\r\ninjury to the bladder may die suddenly and speedily from shock or from\r\nperitonitis in three to seven days, or not until fifteen days or so. In\r\npunctured and incised wounds the urine escapes more slowly, peritonitis\r\ndevelops less early, and death is longer delayed. Hemorrhage in injury\r\nto the bladder is not usually serious; the blood is found partly in\r\nthe bladder, partly in the pelvis, where the fluid extravasated by\r\nperitonitis is also found. The victim of a wound or rupture of the\r\nbladder may often walk about for some time after the injury.\r\n\r\nSTOMACH AND INTESTINES.—Punctured wounds, or, more rarely, incised\r\nwounds of the abdomen may involve these organs, or they may be ruptured\r\nby blows, crushes, and falls, or from disease. Stab-wounds of these\r\nviscera may be multiple from a single stab, the instrument traversing\r\none coil, perhaps, and then wounding others, though this is less often\r\nthe case than with gunshot wounds. Ruptures too may be multiple,\r\nthough less often so than wounds. The ileum is most liable to rupture,\r\nthough several cases of rupture of the jejunum are on record. Like\r\nthe bladder, the stomach and, to a less extent, the intestines are\r\nmore liable to be ruptured when distended. Ruptures of the stomach or\r\nintestines are seldom attended with much hemorrhage, while wounds may\r\noccasionally cause a serious and fatal hemorrhage from the wounding of\r\na large blood-vessel. The principal danger lies in the leakage of the\r\ncontents of the stomach and intestines, which almost always sets up a\r\nseptic peritonitis. This may sometimes become localized and go on to\r\nspontaneous cure, though as a rule it becomes general and is fatal. In\r\nsuch cases early operation may avoid the fatal peritonitis. A punctured\r\nwound may be so small as to be closed by the mucous membrane, avoiding\r\nthe escape of the contents of the gut. Or a wound may not entirely\r\npenetrate the wall of the stomach or intestines, which only gives way\r\nsome days, perhaps, after the injury, though the injury is entirely\r\nresponsible for the delayed result. These injuries are sometimes\r\nfatal immediately or very speedily from shock, while in other cases\r\nof very extensive injury there may be almost no shock, and the victim\r\nis aware of no serious injury. It is an important point to remember\r\nmedico-legally that spontaneous rupture of the stomach or intestines\r\nmay occur owing to ulceration due to disease. This can be determined\r\nby a careful examination of the wall of the stomach or intestines at\r\nthe site of the rupture. A slight injury may also cause rupture if the\r\nwall of the gut is weakened by disease, as the disease causes greater\r\nliability to rupture. Here too it is to be remembered that a severe\r\ninjury causing rupture may leave no mark of violence on the abdominal\r\nwall. The power of walking or other muscular exertion after such\r\ninjuries of the stomach or intestines is not infrequently preserved, as\r\nrecorded in numerous cases.[683] The prognosis in such injuries of the\r\nstomach and intestines is always extremely grave.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCISED, PUNCTURED, AND CONTUSED WOUNDS OF THE GENITAL ORGANS.\r\n\r\nThese are not common as medico-legal cases. Self-castration or\r\nmutilation is sometimes practised by lunatics, idiots, or even\r\nintoxicated persons. Thus a man who, while intoxicated, cut off his\r\ngenital organs and died the next day from the effects of hemorrhage was\r\nseen by Demarquay.[684] Circumcision in infants is also sometimes fatal\r\nfrom phlegmonous inflammation.[685]\r\n\r\nIncised, lacerated, or contused wounds of the female genitals may be\r\nfatal from hemorrhage from many small vessels. Deeply incised wounds\r\nof the female genitals proves wilful and deliberate malice; accident\r\nis out of the question and suicide is improbable in such cases. But we\r\nsometimes have to determine between accidental, self-inflicted, and\r\nhomicidal wounds of these parts, as accidental wounds may occasionally\r\nresemble those made by design and so may furnish more or less\r\ndifficulty, unless all the circumstances are known. Thus Taylor[686]\r\nrelates the case of a child in whom a sharp-pointed stick entered and\r\npassed through the posterior wall of the vagina as she fell from a\r\ntree. The stick was removed by a woman, and the child died in a little\r\nover a day from peritonitis. Unless the circumstances were known, this\r\ncase might have caused suspicion of homicide.\r\n\r\nLunatics, idiots, and drunkards sometimes inflict on themselves wounds\r\nunlike ordinary suicidal ones. In other cases the various points we\r\nhave enumerated in a previous section to distinguish between suicide,\r\nhomicide, and accident may be applied to solve the case.\r\n\r\nContused wounds, such as kicks, etc., of the female genitals may\r\nbe fatal from hemorrhage due to the laceration of the parts.[687]\r\nLike the wounds of the eyebrows, contused wounds of the vulva may\r\nsometimes resemble incised wounds owing to the sharp bony surfaces\r\nbeneath. Careful examination allows a discrimination to be made from\r\nincised wounds. If hemorrhage occurs a long time after the alleged\r\nviolence, it is probably due to natural causes, especially in cases of\r\nmetrorrhagia, etc. It may be alleged in defence that contused wounds\r\nof the female genitals were inflicted post mortem, but besides the\r\nother features which we have already seen help to distinguish between\r\nante-mortem and post-mortem wounds, we may add that kicks and other\r\ncontusions of the vulva, if fatal, are so from hemorrhage or effusion\r\nof blood, and no post-mortem hemorrhage is enough to cause death.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCISED, PUNCTURED, AND CONTUSED WOUNDS OF THE EXTREMITIES.\r\n\r\nThese may be fatal if a large blood vessel or vessels are opened, or\r\nsometimes if a compound fracture or wound of a joint becomes infected.\r\nThey may also in some cases be fatal from shock, from the severity\r\nof the injury. As a rule they are the cause of civil suits, not of\r\ncriminal ones. The various injuries may cause disability for a longer\r\nor shorter time, or even permanently, and more or less deformity may\r\nalso remain. This may be the case with fractures, especially if they\r\noccur near the joints, in which case great caution should be exercised\r\nin giving an opinion or prognosis. It is a common mistaken idea of the\r\nlaity that a fractured or dislocated limb can be made in every case as\r\ngood as before the injury. On the contrary, they not infrequently leave\r\na slight deformity and impairment of function, sometimes even under the\r\nbest treatment. Dislocations may also leave a lasting disability or\r\nweakness, often owing to the carelessness of the injured person.\r\n\r\nWounds of an artery or vein, or both, may result in an aneurism or\r\nan arterio-venous aneurism. Wounds of nerves may cause paralysis and\r\nanæsthesia of the parts supplied. Wounds of muscles or tendons may\r\ncause weakness or complete loss of motion of particular joints. Wounds\r\nof the soft parts, if infected, may lead to cellulitis and phlegmonous\r\ninflammation, which may result in much injury. Wounds of joints, if\r\npenetrating, are serious, for without the proper treatment they may\r\nresult in suppuration in the joint, disorganization of the joint,\r\nand final ankylosis. Before the use of antiseptic treatment such\r\nwounds were not uncommonly fatal. Fractures, simple or compound, or\r\ncontusions of bone especially in young subjects, may be followed by\r\nosteo-periostitis and its consequences, which may require a long time\r\nfor recovery after the fracture is entirely recovered from, and a still\r\nlonger time before the limb can be used. These and many other of the\r\nvarious results of wounds and injuries of the extremities, causing\r\ndeformity or disability, or both, can often be cured or improved by\r\nsurgical treatment or operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE MEDICO-LEGAL CONSIDERATION\r\n\r\n  OF\r\n\r\n  GUNSHOT WOUNDS.\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n  ROSWELL PARK, A.M., M.D.,\r\n\r\n  _Professor of Surgery in the University of Buffalo_; _Attending\r\n  Surgeon to the Buffalo General Hospital_; _Fellow of the German\r\n  Congress of Surgeons_; _of the American  Orthopædic Association_;\r\n  _of the American Genito-Urinary Surgeons’ Association_; _of the\r\n  New York Academy of Medicine_, _etc., etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGUNSHOT WOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\nFEW medical men there are who have long engaged in practice who have\r\nnot been compelled to take part in some medico-legal controversy in\r\ncases of accidental or alleged homicidal gunshot wounds. So soon as\r\ndeath occurs the surgeon ceases to work as such, but may continue to\r\nwork as a medical jurist, and in preparation for this event must be\r\nready to answer any questions bearing upon the case which, though\r\npossibly ridiculous in surgery, are or may be necessary in law. He\r\nmay be called upon to testify as to the precise nature of a wound\r\ninflicted upon the body of a man seen before or after death; as to the\r\nmeans by which it was inflicted; whether the purport was suicidal or\r\nhomicidal; how much blood was lost; whether the weapon was near to or\r\nat a distance from the body when fired; whether it were possible that\r\nthe deceased could have fired it himself; whether after the reception\r\nof the wound the person could have moved or performed any act—in other\r\nwords, whether death was instantaneous. He may be asked also as to\r\ngenuine or spurious blood-stains, whether genuine blood-stains were\r\nhuman or from some other animal; whether possibly they were from the\r\nbody of the deceased. He will be expected to tell from what direction\r\nthe bullet or missile was fired; which the wound of entrance and which\r\nof exit, and many other things possible concerning the circumstances\r\nunder which death occurred. It is unnecessary to state that questions\r\nof this nature call not only for conventional surgical skill, but for\r\nthe highest degree of shrewdness and general information, as well as\r\nsometimes for expert knowledge with regard to small-arms and their\r\nballistics.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that the first duty of a medical jurist is to\r\ncultivate a habit of minute observation. When this is combined with a\r\nknowledge of what the law requires and with the results of a technical\r\neducation, he will be able to meet all or nearly all of the scientific\r\nquestions which may be asked of him. A learned judge once said that\r\n“a medical man when he sees a dead body should notice everything.”\r\nCertainly he should make a minute scrutiny of the body to note whether\r\nthere are upon the dress or hands of the deceased marks of blood, or\r\nwhether blood-stains are noted in different parts of the room; whether\r\nthe body or any part of it is cold or warm; whether the limbs are cold\r\nor rigid or pliant, since by these means the accurate date of death may\r\nbe more accurately determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION AND DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nIn determining facts attending a suspicious case of gunshot wound,\r\nthere should be noted, if known, 1st, the exact time of death, as\r\nwell as of infliction of the wound; 2d, location and attitude of the\r\nbody; 3d, condition of clothing; 4th, anything of importance in its\r\nenvironment; 5th, external appearance of the body, as well as state\r\nof countenance; 6th, exact description of all marks of violence and\r\nof blood-stains; 7th, the presence of cadaveric rigidity and the\r\nsurface upon which cadaver has been lying, as well as its age and\r\ncondition of general nourishment; 8th, time when deceased was last\r\nseen alive or known to have been alive; 9th, time after death at which\r\nexamination is made; 10th, all physical circumstances corroborating\r\nor arousing suspicions of suicide or homicide; 11th, account of an\r\naccurate internal post-mortem examination, in which direction of\r\nthe bullet or missile is noted, along with a careful description of\r\nparts disturbed or injured in its course, large vessels or nerves cut\r\nacross, effusions of blood, and in every way as accurate a description\r\nas possible of the exact damage done. To this also should be added a\r\nminute scrutiny of other parts, in order to establish clearly that\r\ndeath was due to the alleged injury, or on the other hand that it may\r\nhave resulted from natural causes, and that the injury in question was\r\nonly a consecutive and contributing cause. Especially should there be\r\nexamined those organs in which occur the most common causes of death,\r\nnamely, the brain, the heart and great blood-vessels, and the viscera.\r\nMoreover, if an operation has been performed the post-mortem examiner\r\nshould be prepared to speak with reasonable positiveness as to whether\r\nsaid operation was, in the first place, necessary if life were to be\r\npreserved, and, in the second place, whether death were due to the\r\ninjury proper or to the attempt to save life thus made necessary.\r\nFor the determination of all this, obviously the best time for the\r\nperformance of the examination is the earliest possible moment after\r\ndeath. Nevertheless, bodies are sometimes exhumed for this purpose, and\r\nmuch information is obtainable even after a considerable interval of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIf death has been caused by a bullet which has not passed through the\r\nbody, but lodged, it should by all means be obtained, since evidence\r\nof the greatest value may inhere in it. Moreover, in first noting the\r\nposition of the body, the direction of the wound, or the location of\r\na blood-clot upon the floor or clothing or elsewhere, may indicate to\r\nthe surgeon or other astute person the point at which the bullet may\r\nbe found concealed or buried in some soft or hard object. This bullet\r\nshould be recovered, if possible, at all events, although if taken\r\nfrom the body itself the evidence it conveys may possibly weigh more\r\nheavily than if removed from some object outside the body. The exact\r\nnumber of gunshot wounds with a minute description and location of each\r\nshould be committed to paper at once, as well as any statement, if at\r\nall reliable, concerning the number of shots fired, since valuable\r\ndeductions may be reached as to the number of bullets which have passed\r\nthrough or which have lodged within the body. It is well sometimes,\r\nalso, before dissecting out the bullet-wound, to insert first a stiff\r\nand then a flexible probe or something which shall, if possible,\r\nfollow the bullet-track, since occasionally a question comes up of\r\nthe direction in which it was fired. Even though surgeons well know\r\nthat such questions are impossible of satisfactory answer, owing to\r\nthe manner in which a bullet is diverted in its course by the various\r\ntissues of the body, it will nevertheless create a good impression\r\nas to the thoroughness and exactness of an examination should it be\r\nbrought out, in answer to questioning, that this had been done. Many\r\nan excellent surgeon has been surprised upon the stand by the question\r\nfrom one of the counsel as to whether he knew that some certain writer\r\nhad stated that it was always well, in trying to determine the course\r\nand direction of a bullet, to put the patient or the body, as the case\r\nmight be, in the exact position in which it was when the shot was\r\nfired, providing this be known. The accomplished surgeon knows that\r\nthis is a matter of very trifling import, but the witness’ status\r\nwill be much better established with the jury if he can show himself\r\nfamiliar with this possible method of examination.\r\n\r\nWhen a suspected person is brought before a magistrate, accused of\r\nhomicidal attempt, it is very likely that the judge will require a\r\nwritten statement or opinion from the surgeon in attendance as to\r\nthe extent and danger of the victim’s injuries, and especially as to\r\nwhether these are of a character dangerous to life. The meaning of\r\nthese words is left entirely to the sagacity of the surgeon. A mere\r\nnaked declaration of this fact is insufficient. He must, if called\r\nupon by the court, give his grounds for his belief, and these may be\r\nrigorously examined by counsel. He will also probably be asked as to\r\nthe presumable duration of life and possibly the effect of operation.\r\nThus the prisoner’s immediate liberty or restraint may depend upon the\r\nsurgeon’s words. Perhaps the only advice which can be offered here\r\nis to qualify between injuries directly dangerous to life and those\r\nin which life is endangered merely by possible complications, such\r\nas sepsis, gangrene, etc. Still, aside from wounds which are either\r\nfatal or may be nearly completely recovered from, there is another\r\nquite large class of those causing grievous bodily harm in which it\r\nis a question for the jury always to decide what was the intent of\r\nthe accused. A medical witness may thus in such a case be of great\r\nassistance to the court by giving an account of the injury devoid of\r\ntechnicalities, and of its possible consequences. It should also always\r\nbe stated, if known, whether the patient was under the influence of\r\nliquor or any narcotic at the moment of injury.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of wounds either of the living or dead body, it\r\nshould always be determined for medico-legal purposes whether there\r\nis about them fluid or coagulated blood or ecchymosis, that is,\r\nlivid discoloration of the skin from effused blood. The color of the\r\necchymotic spot will give a valuable clew as to the time between the\r\ninfliction of the wound and death. Putrefaction of such a wound must\r\nnot be mistaken for gangrene. In giving reports on such cases care\r\nshould be taken to distinguish between facts and inferences. In fact,\r\nthe inferences had better be kept unreported or confined to a separate\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nShould there be any possible suspicion of a combination of poisoning\r\nand gunshot wound, the stomach contents should be carefully preserved\r\nand sealed up in the presence of witnesses before turning over the\r\nsame to the analytical chemist, whose receipt for the package, with\r\na careful description of the same, will probably have to be placed\r\nin evidence. Any fact on the condition of the stomach with regard to\r\ndigestion is always worth noting. In the case of Reg. _v._ Spicer\r\n(Berks Lent Assizes, 1846) a most important point hinged on the\r\nexamination of the stomach. The body was found at the foot of a\r\nstairway. The prisoner stated that after he and his wife had had their\r\ndinner he heard a fall. The woman had died instantaneously and the\r\ndeath occurred about the dinner-hour. Upon examination the stomach was\r\nfound empty, without a trace of food. It was, therefore, clear that a\r\npart at least of the prisoner’s story was untrue.\r\n\r\nEvidence as to whether the wounds were superficial or deep may be\r\nof value. If the edges are swollen or large, or if granulation or\r\ncicatrization have commenced, it is evident that the person must have\r\nlived some hours or some days after their reception. The same is true\r\nof suppuration, adhesion, or gangrene. It must also be remembered in\r\nthis connection that very few gunshot wounds will show much change in\r\nless than ten or twelve hours save that due to the extravasation of\r\nblood. Should the question come up as to whether a gunshot wound had\r\nbeen inflicted before or after death, we may remember the principal\r\ncharacteristics of a wound inflicted during life, which are more or\r\nless eversion, more or less hemorrhage with diffusion of blood into the\r\ntissues, and the presence of clots. In a wound made after death little\r\nor no blood is effused, unless it come from some vessel very near the\r\nsurface, in which case it will be venous in character and will not\r\ncoagulate as does that which is poured out of a wound in the living.\r\nThe track of the bullet also will not be found filled with coagula.\r\nIn these respects a little will depend upon whether the body has lost\r\nits animal heat or not. The gunshot puncture of a divided artery in a\r\ndead body will present a very different appearance from one inflicted\r\nbefore death, even though it be the cause of death. Bleeding after\r\ndeath is exclusively venous, and there does not occur extravasation\r\nof blood in the cellular tissues, nor does it coagulate. Questions of\r\nthis character come up sometimes in the case of multiple wounds or\r\ninjuries, and it is, at times, of importance to be able to determine\r\nwhether the assault or injury has been continued after death. Changes\r\nin color of an ecchymosed spot rarely begin until after the expiration\r\nof twenty-four hours, when its dark margins become lighter, and as time\r\ngoes on the whole area passes through successive shades of violet,\r\ngreen, and yellow; its area may also increase sometimes to remarkable\r\nproportions, but the central portions are always darker than the\r\nperiphery, the darkest spot corresponding to the centre of violence.\r\nEcchymosis is longer in disappearing in the old than in the young. Its\r\nvarious features also will vary a little in accordance with the tissues\r\nbruised.\r\n\r\nGunshot wounds pertaining to spurious suicidal attempts are usually\r\nfound not to involve vital parts, while they will have most of the\r\ncharacteristics of injuries inflicted from a weapon near at hand. The\r\nskin or the clothing will show powder-marks, and if a wad is a feature\r\nof the cartridge used, it may be found in one place or the other. In\r\nthese cases there is also relatively more laceration and bruising,\r\nwhile sometimes the hand which held the weapon may be blackened or\r\nburnt by the discharge of the same. Self-inflicted wounds, in other\r\nwords, must necessarily partake of the character of near wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE FROM THE SITUATION OF THE WOUND.\r\n\r\nIt has been generally noted that suicidal wounds are for the most part\r\nconfined to the front or lateral parts of the body; gunshot wounds\r\nof this character being found usually in the region of the heart,\r\nthe face, and the temples. The presence of an injury to these parts\r\nis not necessarily indicative of suicide, but the existence of such\r\ninjuries in other parts of the body is at least negative evidence of\r\nhomicidal attempt. Moreover, Orfila has observed that it is not so much\r\nthe situation as the direction of the wound which gives evidence for\r\nor against the presumption of suicide. The question has been raised\r\nwhether it were possible to have a gunshot wound without external\r\nevidence. There has been recorded more than one case where a bullet\r\nentering through the open mouth has penetrated the brain without\r\npassing through the vertex of the skull and has killed instantly\r\nwithout leaving any external mark.\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary to establish, if possible, the direction of such a\r\nwound, and this may be coupled with a knowledge of the right-handedness\r\nor the left-handedness of the person who inflicted it, or may shed\r\nlight in this way upon some personal peculiarity which may lead to\r\nthe detection of the guilty person. Thus it is said of Sir Astley\r\nCooper that in one instance he remarked that a certain wound could\r\nnot have been inflicted except by a left-handed person, and that his\r\nobservation led to the detection of the murderer. It has been stated\r\nthat for the detection of the weapon or instrument used it should\r\nbe placed first in one hand of the deceased and then in the other,\r\nwhile the other extremities are so manipulated that it may be clearly\r\ndetermined whether suicidal attempt were possible or no. There is\r\nordinarily little difficulty experienced in distinguishing suicidal\r\nfrom accidental wounds. In the former case extraneous signs and\r\ncircumstances point more clearly to the intent of the deceased than do,\r\nperhaps, the peculiarities of the wound itself. This is to be settled\r\nmainly by the evidence of those who find the body; in other words, by\r\ncircumstantial evidence.\r\n\r\nIn suicides ordinarily one wound only is met with. At any rate,\r\nprobably one only that has destroyed life. Consequently the presence of\r\nseveral wounds, each of which was necessarily fatal, constitutes almost\r\nconclusive evidence of murder, the strength of the same depending upon\r\nthe necessary fatality of more than one of these. Thus it is hardly\r\nconceivable that a suicide should shoot himself through the heart\r\nand through the brain; the coexistence of two such wounds would be\r\nalmost conclusive of homicide. The existence of multiple wounds is a\r\nrather strong presumption of insanity or drunkenness of the person who\r\ninflicted them. Men who kill when under the influence of liquor not\r\ninfrequently inflict injuries enough to be several times fatal.\r\n\r\nThe coexistence of wounds made by cutting weapons, as well as firearms,\r\nis not unknown. These are occasionally suicidal, ordinarily they\r\nbetoken murderous attempt. If suicidal the deceased will ordinarily be\r\nfound to have been a lunatic.\r\n\r\nBut evidence is to be obtained also from signs and circumstances\r\nseparable from the wound itself. Thus the position of the body may be\r\nsuch as to invalidate the theory of accident or suicide. The position\r\nof the weapon, too, is something to be noted with great care. Whether,\r\nfor instance, this be firmly held within the hand of the corpse, or\r\nwhether it had been simply placed there after his death; whether it be\r\nfound where it would seem to have been most naturally dropped after its\r\ndischarge, or found somewhere where it could scarcely have been placed\r\nor thrown by the deceased; whether it be found at such a point that it\r\nis clearly evident from other signs it could not have been dropped by\r\nthe deceased, since death must have been caused too quickly for him to\r\nhave traversed the intervening space.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE FROM THE WEAPON AND PROJECTILE.\r\n\r\nEvidence of great value may be obtained often from the weapon itself.\r\nFirst of all, from the position in which it is found, as stated above;\r\nsecond, from a careful examination of itself. It should be noted\r\nwhether there be any blood upon it, and whether this be so fresh as\r\nnot to have caused any rust; whether it may possibly be so smeared\r\nwith blood as to indicate a hand-to-hand conflict; or whether any part\r\nof the weapon may have been used as a club or bludgeon, as would be\r\nshown by the presence upon it of hair entangled in dry blood. When such\r\nblood is removed from the weapon it should be carefully examined with\r\nthe microscope, since from the detection and identification of hair or\r\nfibres of fabric evidence of the greatest value may be adduced. Next\r\nit should be ascertained whether a weapon shows signs of having been\r\nrecently discharged or whether it be evident that it could not have\r\nbeen so, and such determination of the time element as may be afforded\r\nby a study of this kind should be contrasted with that made after a\r\nstudy of the wound. If the weapon be a revolver or a repeating arm of\r\nany kind, it should be determined if possible how many cartridges or\r\nbullets have been fired, and whether at or about the same time, and\r\nthis information should be compared with the evidences obtained from\r\nthe body and from the room or locality in which the suicide or murder\r\noccurred. If, for instance, it be determined that three cartridges\r\nhave been fired and but two bullet-wounds are found in the body, an\r\nexamination of the room may show where went the third bullet. Next the\r\ncalibre of the weapon should be noted and the weight of the ball which\r\nit discharged and its dimensions should be compared with any which\r\nmay be found in or about the body. The weight of the bullets attached\r\nto cartridges of various sizes and makes is usually stamped upon the\r\npackages in which they are sold, or can readily be obtained from the\r\nmakers of the same. A bullet taken from a body weighing after its\r\nremoval more than do the other bullets undischarged in the weapon by\r\nwhich an injury is alleged to have been inflicted is rather presumptive\r\nevidence against the injury from that source.\r\n\r\nCAN A BULLET LOSE IN WEIGHT BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN IT LEAVES THE BORE\r\nOF A GUN AND ITS DISCOVERY IN A BODY?—Here springs up a question upon\r\nwhich some very interesting evidence has been adduced in different\r\ntrials. To discuss this matter completely the question should be\r\ndivided into two, the first being:\r\n\r\nDOES A BULLET SUFFER LOSS OF WEIGHT DURING ITS COURSE THROUGH THE PIECE\r\nAND THE AIR BEFORE IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE BODY?—A personal\r\nletter received from Captain Charles Shaler, of the Ordnance Department\r\nof the United States Army, in reply to certain questions, tends to\r\nfully settle that a lead bullet suffers a certain loss of weight in the\r\nbarrel due to the friction between the bullet and the bore; this is\r\nknown as “leading” and varies according to circumstances. “Patching”\r\nthe bullet is often resorted to in order to reduce the leading;\r\nlubrication is also practised. The fusing of a bullet takes place\r\nespecially with lead bullets. A ball which has been partly fused in\r\nthe bore will lose the fused portions in the bore or in flight, and\r\nwill move irregularly on account of the resulting irregularity of form.\r\nA .45-calibre, 500-grain service bullet, lead alloyed with tin, was\r\nweighed without lubricant and was found to weigh 500.5 grains. It was\r\nthen lubricated in the cannelures and was fired into a butt composed of\r\nthree barrels placed end to end and filled with sawdust. Tho bullet was\r\nrecovered, no lubricant being found in the cannelures, and re-weighed,\r\nthe weight obtained being 485.5. The loss of weight was, therefore,\r\n15 grains or three per cent, some of which may have been due to the\r\nbullet penetrating the sawdust. A German-silver “jacketed” .30-calibre\r\nbullet, weighing before firing 231 grains, fired without lubrication,\r\nwhen recovered and re-weighed was found to have suffered a loss of\r\nweight of one-half grain or one-quarter of one per cent. The other part\r\nof the main question is:\r\n\r\nDOES THE BULLET LOSE IN WEIGHT IN ITS COURSE THROUGH THE BODY?—This\r\nis, of course, intended to pertain only to those instances in which\r\nthere is no evidence of splitting or division of the bullet, and\r\nrefers only to the effect of friction or attrition. June 5th, 1878,\r\nin Saratoga County, Mrs. Jesse Billings was accidentally killed by a\r\nbullet. Her husband was arrested and tried for murder. On the first\r\ntrial he was acquitted. A second trial, however, was held, and some\r\nvery interesting expert testimony was brought out on matters pertaining\r\nto these questions. The medical evidence is published in full by Dr.\r\nLewis Balch, of Albany, in the Transactions of the Medical Society\r\nof the State of New York for 1881. The rifle from which the bullet\r\nwas supposed to have been fired was found in a well, and was sworn to\r\nhave belonged to Jesse Billings. In it was found a cartridge of the\r\ntype known as the Commercial Long No. 44. This gun became an important\r\nfactor in the case, and most of the evidence as to whether it was the\r\nweapon with which the murder had been committed was referred to the\r\nmedical experts. The defence in the first trial claimed that all the\r\nlead fired was found in Mrs. Billings’ head. On the second trial the\r\nsame claim was not made, but that it was a smaller bullet than a .44\r\nand its weight less than 220 grains; that in consequence this rifle\r\ncould not have been that from which the shot was fired, for it only\r\ncalled for a .44 ball, and that it would have thrown a bullet with\r\nsuch force that it must have gone entirely through the head. They\r\nfurther claimed that powder-marks and grains of powder were found in\r\nthe window-sash, showing that the weapon was fired near the window, and\r\nthat the hole in the glass was not large enough to admit a full-sized\r\n.44 ball. The verdict was mainly won upon these statements. A question\r\nfor the medical experts to answer was, what would be the effect upon\r\nthe skull of a .44-calibre ball fired from a Ballard rifle, the ball\r\nweighing 220 grains and the charge of powder being 28 grains? also what\r\nwould be the effect upon the ball? Experts from the Ordnance Corps and\r\nfrom the rifle factories were able to testify that the bullet found\r\nin Mrs. Billings’ head was originally a .44-calibre ball; also that\r\nits markings showed the peculiar left-handed twist used in rifling\r\nthis particular arm. The defence maintained that it could not have\r\nbeen a .44, claiming that the hole in the window-pane showed that. The\r\noriginal window produced in court was no criterion, since from repeated\r\nhandling the hole made by the bullet had become enlarged and changed\r\nin shape. Both of the experts for the defence believed that the ball\r\ncould not make a hole smaller than itself when passing through glass.\r\nThis necessarily supposes that the ball after being fired is the same\r\ncalibre as before, which, as shown above, is not always the case. So\r\nDr. Balch fired forty-five rounds from the Billings rifle with 220\r\ngrains of lead and 28 grains of powder. The shots were fired through\r\nglass set in sashes, the glass being 28×13¼, double thick and American\r\nmake. The rifle was discharged at varying angles and at distances\r\nvarying from two to seventy feet, and he obtained one shot where the\r\nhole made would not admit a full-sized ball. His summary was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Balls unable to pass through   1\r\n  Balls partly passed            3\r\n  Balls passed                  18\r\n  Cartridge passed              21\r\n  Glass broken out               2\r\n                                —\r\n        Total                   45\r\n\r\nOther rounds were fired from a Colt’s navy revolver, old style, .36\r\ncalibre, at distances varying from ten to twenty feet. The holes made\r\nwere so large that the barrels and ramrods could be passed without\r\ntouching. The examination of the one instance noted above where the\r\naperture in the glass was smaller than the ball is explained by Balch\r\nas follows: “A ball conoidal in form, passing with great velocity,\r\nstrikes glass, penetrates, but does not break the glass at the point of\r\nentrance. The point struck is instantly disintegrated, and so rapid is\r\nthe stroke that it has not time to call upon the surrounding particles\r\nfor support; hence the smallness of the hole. As glass is made it\r\nvaries in elasticity; some parts which are to be cut into panes cool\r\nfaster than others. A bullet striking the portion of the glass which\r\nhas cooled quickly strikes an object which will yield somewhat to the\r\nforce; in doing this a hole will be made smaller than if that more\r\nbrittle had been struck. Furthermore, all rifles taper more or less\r\nfrom breech to muzzle, that is, the muzzle will measure one or more\r\nthousandths or hundredths less than the breech. The bullet being forced\r\nthrough the narrow aperture yields to the pressure and becomes smaller.\r\nThe gun under consideration was measured at the New York Armory, and\r\nfound to be .44 at the breech or chamber and .423 at the muzzle.\r\nConsidering these various facts, statements that a ball of known size\r\nwill make a hole through glass smaller than the size of the ball when\r\nfired do not admit of doubt as to their verity. Some statements bearing\r\non this same point contained in a recent letter from Captain Shaler, of\r\nthe United States Army, deserve mention here. The following experiment\r\nwas made in Washington by Captain Lyon in October, 1880:\r\n\r\n“Noticing a statement in a newspaper to the effect that a ball fired\r\nfrom a rifle would, in passing through glass, make a round hole smaller\r\nthan the diameter of the ball used, the following experiment was made:\r\n\r\n“Service ammunition used, in a calibre .45 Springfield rifle to\r\npenetrate glass.\r\n\r\n  ═════════════════════╤═══════════════════╤════════════════════════\r\n       Time Fired.     │ Size of Hole made │       Remarks.\r\n                       │ in Glass, inches. │\r\n  ─────────────────────┼───────────────────┼────────────────────────\r\n           1           │       0.570       │\r\n           2           │       0.550       │\r\n           3           │       0.600       │\r\n           4           │       0.600       │\r\n           5           │       0.575       │\r\n           6           │       0.575       │ The frame holding the\r\n           7           │       0.590       │   glass was placed 25\r\n           8           │       0.620       │   yards from the muzzle\r\n           9           │       0.600       │   of the gun.\r\n                       │                   │\r\n  Average size of hole │       0.586       │\r\n  Calibre of bullet    │       0.458       │\r\n                       │      ──────       │\r\n  Difference           │       0.125       │\r\n  ─────────────────────┴───────────────────┴────────────────────────\r\n\r\n“From the above it will be noted that there is no uniformity in the\r\nsize of the holes and that they all exceed the diameter of the bullet.\r\n\r\n“These experiments were supplemented by some made recently in which\r\na sash containing six panes of ordinary window-glass was placed\r\nat twenty-five yards from the firer and the glass was successively\r\npenetrated (a separate pane being used in each case) by bullets from a\r\nservice .45-calibre Springfield rifle, a .30-calibre Springfield rifle,\r\na .45-calibre Colt’s revolver and a .22-calibre revolver. In every case\r\nthe hole made was much larger than the bullet making it.”\r\n\r\nWith reference also to the effect of a ball being smaller than its\r\noriginal diameter after it leaves the piece, Captain Shaler states:\r\n“All very compressible bullets forced by inertia lose a certain amount\r\neven though they also gain force by slugging. Forcing by inertia tends\r\nto shorten the bullet and increase the diameter, while slugging tends\r\nto lengthen the bullet and reduce its diameter. Whether the bullet is\r\nsmaller after it leaves the piece depends upon the bullet used and the\r\nmethod of forcing employed.”\r\n\r\nTo return to the Billings case, it was claimed that the bullet was\r\nalso too small. It weighed 165 grains, 55 less than when it was fired\r\nfrom the rifle. Balch found in firing at human skulls, the subjects in\r\nall the trials but two being placed in a sitting posture, sometimes\r\nwith a sash like the Billings window in front of the subject, that the\r\nball lost lead in accordance with the resistance it met with and the\r\namount of bone ploughed in its passage. These experiments conclusively\r\nprove that the weight of a ball taken from a body after being fired,\r\nit having traversed a bone in its flight, is by no means evidence of\r\nits weight before firing; in other words, a ball always loses some\r\nlead when passing through bone. With the same rifle as that produced\r\nat the trial he made a series of experiments in the dissecting-room,\r\nendeavoring to make a bullet enter the skull at the same point and in\r\nnearly as possible the same direction as in the case of the murdered\r\nwoman. In six such experiments there were varying losses of lead, all\r\nthe bullets used being the same general weight. In two trials the\r\ndistance was but ten feet from the muzzle, yet more lead was lost\r\nthan in any of the other four. The least loss recorded took place at\r\nthe longest distance, thirty-five feet. This in part accounts for the\r\nloss of lead, for at ten feet the bullet has not acquired its greatest\r\npenetrating power, for he showed by experiment that a 220-grain bullet\r\nfired at a human skull will lose more lead than was missing from the\r\nBillings bullet, thus disposing of the question raised by the defence\r\nthat a ball could not have weighed 220 grains before being fired.\r\n\r\nJust how to account for the missing lead has never been clearly\r\nestablished. We have to remember that a few grains may be left in\r\nthe bore of a rifle, especially if rusty; that in passing through\r\nglass another portion is lost, and finally it is scarcely conceivable\r\nthat any bullet should penetrate an adult skull, especially in\r\nthe neighborhood of the mastoid processes, without losing quite a\r\nperceptible percentage of its mass by friction.\r\n\r\nIt was also claimed by the defence that the ball taken from Mrs.\r\nBillings’ head had been fired from a weapon of low velocity, which\r\nwas held to account for the fact that the ball failed to pass out of\r\nthe skull. The rifle when tested at the Government Arsenal showed\r\na mean velocity of 999 feet per second. Had it been as high as was\r\nsupposed by the defence, namely, 1,300 or 1,400 feet, the argument\r\nthat a bullet driven with this force would always go through the skull\r\nwould have more weight, but with the velocity found by actual test the\r\nenergy of the ball was lessened to nearly one-half of that supposed.\r\nThe bullet which killed Mrs. Billings did not pass entirely through\r\nthe skull. It ploughed into the opposite side and broke before it a\r\ntriangular piece of bone which broke the skin externally. This shows\r\nthe resistance of external fascia against perforation. A study of the\r\nlines of fracture in this particular case proved very interesting, but\r\nperhaps would be somewhat irrelevant here. A measurement of the skull\r\nand of the bullet-track through it shows the former to have been of\r\nmore than ordinary thickness and density, and the channel ploughed in\r\nthe bone by the bullet along the base of it to have been nearly two\r\ninches in length. Dr. Balch gives the following conclusions to his very\r\ninteresting evidence: 1st. A leaden ball passing through bone loses\r\nlead in proportion to the amount of bone traversed. 2d. If the petrous\r\nportion of the temporal bone be the part struck by the ball and struck\r\nsquarely at the base, that portion of the bone is crumbled or broken in\r\nsuch exceedingly fine pieces as to defy restoration. 3d. That if the\r\nball struck any part of the skull the petrous portion will be broken,\r\nbut can be usually recognized and generally put together again. 4th.\r\nThat a ball of given calibre fired through glass may make a hole\r\nenough smaller than the full size of the ball before firing to prevent\r\nan unfired ball of like calibre passing.\r\n\r\nIn all this kind of experimentation upon cadavers for the purpose of\r\neliciting evidence by reproducing as nearly as possible ante-mortem\r\ninjuries, we must not forget that Casper has strongly insisted that\r\n“it is extremely difficult to break up the organic cohesion of dead\r\norgans.... If we endeavor to fracture the skull of a dead adult we\r\nshall find that an amount of force which if applied in life would\r\nindubitably produce fissures if not fracture, or complete crushing\r\nof the skull, leaves the dead skull quite uninjured.... The most\r\npowerful blows struck down upon the body, laid down horizontally, were\r\nwithout result, and only after repeated violent blows were we able to\r\nproduce perhaps one or a few fissures in the occipital or parietal\r\nbone, or in the temporal bone (squamous portion), and usually in the\r\nlatter. We were unable to produce more considerable effects, such as\r\ncomplete smashing of the skull or fissures of its base, even in one\r\nsingle instance. The dead skull seems to have considerably more power\r\nof resistance, and after its removal fissures of the bone were more\r\neasily produced by similar blows” (Vol. I., p. 245). And again: “The\r\nresult of my experiments on the dead body in regard to gunshot wounds\r\ncould only be to make more complete the proof of the resistance of\r\nthe dead corporeal tissues, in contradistinction to the tissues when\r\nalive. After I had already learned this peculiarity from my experiments\r\nwith contused wounds, this peculiar resistent property was found to be\r\nconfirmed in a most remarkable manner” (“Forensic Medicine,” Vol. I.,\r\np. 271).\r\n\r\nIf the number of bullets known to have been fired, or, more important\r\nstill, which have been found exceeds the number which could have been\r\ndischarged from the weapon in question, a very large element of doubt\r\nand uncertainty is introduced which must be quieted by other and more\r\ncircumstantial evidence. Should two different weapons be in question,\r\nit is very necessary to establish from which of them the bullets have\r\nbeen discharged. This can be done mainly by weight and evident calibre\r\nof the bullets, or some other peculiarity; possibly in disputed cases\r\neven by analysis of the metal.\r\n\r\n=Wounds by Shot-Guns.=—In most of what has been said it has been\r\nsupposed that the injury has been inflicted by an arm of the kind\r\ncommonly described under the terms pistol, revolver, or rifle. Gunshot\r\nwounds are, however, occasionally inflicted with shot-guns and a charge\r\nof shot varying in size from small bird-shot up to that generally known\r\nas buck-shot. It is characteristic of such missiles that they separate\r\nafter their discharge from the gun, and a determination of the degree\r\nof their separation is approximately a determination of the distance\r\nof the mark from the muzzle of the weapon. In suicide or accidental\r\ndischarges of a shot-gun the muzzle is so near the body that the charge\r\nof shot acts very much as would a single bullet of the size of the\r\nbore of the gun, and near wounds thus inflicted, while necessarily\r\nlarge, have about them a minimum laceration and disturbance of tissue,\r\nso that perhaps only by their size could one say, viewing the wound\r\nalone, that the weapon used had been a shot-gun. On the other hand, at\r\na distance of a few feet the shot begin to separate to such an extent\r\nthat there is much more laceration of tissue, and after separation to\r\nan indeterminate, because variable, number of feet we get such marks\r\nas individual shot may make. This distance is indeterminate because it\r\nis predicated on the size of the gun, the dimensions of shot, and the\r\nweight of the charge of powder. The writer, for instance, has recently\r\nseen one case where the muzzle of the gun could not have been more than\r\ntwo feet away from the surface of the foot at which it was discharged,\r\nthe consequence being a round and very slightly ragged hole through the\r\nmid-tarsal region from dorsum to sole.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for a single grain of shot to produce death. Such a\r\ncase is related by Ollivier d’Angers: a thief scaling a wall received\r\nat a distance of fifteen paces a charge of shot from a fowling-piece;\r\nhe fell dead immediately. The charge had struck him in the breast,\r\ncentring over a space of three or four inches, but one shot had\r\npenetrated the aorta over the attachment of the sigmoid valves, and\r\nanother had traversed the entire wall of this vessel.\r\n\r\nPOWDER-MARKS.—A very important part of evidence in case of near wounds\r\nof gunshot character pertains to the powder-marks upon the clothing\r\nand skin. Naturally every one knows that when a weapon is discharged\r\nnear a given surface there will be more or less powder-marking upon\r\nthat surface, the same being due to particles of gunpowder which are\r\nincompletely or not at all consumed, and which are black because\r\nof the charcoal they contain; but the circumstances under which\r\npowder-marks of a given character can be inflicted are so extremely\r\nvariable that no statistics or information of value in a general\r\nway can be given. Thus the fineness of the marks will depend upon\r\nthe fineness of the powder, and the area covered and the depth of\r\nthe marking upon the same, upon the distance of the muzzle from the\r\nsurface; and the only way to make out the exact distance of the muzzle\r\nfrom the surface at the time of the infliction of a given wound is to\r\nuse the same weapon, if possible, with cartridges or charges out of the\r\nsame lot as that used at the time of injury. Distances could, perhaps,\r\nbe stated in round numbers, but their value would only be remotely\r\napproximate, and in a given case the best evidence is to be obtained by\r\nexperiment with the fire-arm in question.\r\n\r\n=Dimensions of Perforations.=—At different times a great deal of\r\nweight has been attached to the dimension of the perforation through\r\nsuch objects as wood, glass, or even through the bones of the body,\r\nmade by the bullet which is supposed or known to have destroyed\r\nlife. Wrong inferences have been drawn sometimes from a study of\r\nundischarged bullets or cartridges similar, at least before firing,\r\nto that which has been taken from a given body. It has been stated,\r\nfor instance, that such a bullet was too large to have passed through\r\nsuch an aperture or to have made such a hole, or that it was so much\r\nsmaller than a certain hole that it was not the particular missile\r\nwhich made that perforation. Upon this matter has hinged a great deal\r\nof uncertainty and consequently a good deal of study. The size of\r\nopening which a bullet of given calibre will make through wood depends\r\nupon the distance of the weapon, the firing charge, the velocity of\r\nthe bullet, the extent to which its shape has been altered by passing\r\nthrough the given barrier, by the heat of the explosion, by the impact\r\nof the air upon the heated and consequently softened metal, and by the\r\ndensity and thickness of the wood, as well as by the resistance which\r\nit may have offered mainly from its being fixed in place or movable.\r\nThere is, however, ordinarily less question about the size of a similar\r\nhole through a piece of glass or bone. It is generally supposed that\r\na bullet passing through a window-pane will shatter it. This depends,\r\nhowever, mainly upon the perfection of fixation of the glass in its\r\nresting-place. If for purposes of experiment panes of glass be tacked\r\ninto a shutter and bullets be fired at them from varying distances,\r\nthey will be practically invariably shattered. It is, however, quite\r\ndifferent if the pane of glass be firmly fixed in a frame by means of\r\nputty which has become old and hard, and especially if the window-frame\r\nitself be closely fitted in the casing. Under these circumstances a\r\nbullet will often make a clearly punched hole, or one with very few\r\nradiating lines of fracture. Experiment, therefore, to secure evidence\r\nshould be made under circumstances exactly parallel to those which\r\nnecessitate such evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE FROM EXAMINATION OF THE DEAD BODY.\r\n\r\n=Fractures.=—Considerable evidence of great interest with respect to\r\nthe effect of a bullet-wound upon the skull and the possibility of\r\nfractures being produced at the base by _contre coup_ will be found in\r\nthe statement of the case of The People _v._ Elisha B. Fero, published\r\nby Dr. Charles T. Porter, of Albany, in the _Journal of Psychological\r\nMedicine_, April, 1870. Mrs. Fero was murdered while in her bed and\r\nwas found to have been bruised about the head and body, her husband\r\nclaiming that the deed was that of a robber who had attacked them\r\nboth. He was found with slight bruises or scratches about the face and\r\nblack marks as if from burnt powder between the middle fingers of his\r\nright hand. The first autopsy appears to have been carelessly made,\r\nbut a flattened conical ball weighing twenty-six and one-half grains\r\nwas found lodged in the middle of the right cerebral hemisphere. It\r\nhad not gone completely through the brain. Its base fitted the shells\r\nof the metallic cartridges used in Fero’s revolver. Eight days after\r\ndeath a second examination was made, after which the head was removed\r\nand preserved in 95% alcohol. A theory of the prosecution was that\r\nMrs. Fero was murdered by her husband; that he shot her, as well as\r\nstruck her numerous blows upon both sides of the head and its front\r\nand back with some broad, heavy, and elastic body, making fractures\r\nfound on autopsy. Not the least interesting part of the testimony\r\nis that referring to the condition of tissues alleged to have been\r\nbruised after long preservation in alcohol. The expert testimony in\r\nthis case appeared to show that such fractures as were found, without\r\nreference to the fact of external bruises, were due to the unskilful\r\nmanner in which the skull-cap was removed. In this connection it\r\nis well right here to emphasize the fact that fresh fractures can\r\nbe produced in the skull by too forcible or injudicious efforts\r\nto remove the calvarium when making autopsies, or that fractures\r\npreviously existing can be extended or complicated in the same way.\r\nShaw in his “Manual of Anatomy” says: “The question whether there has\r\nbeen a fracture of the cranium previous to death is sometimes more\r\ndifficult to decide than a person not accustomed to make dissections\r\nmight imagine. If the fracture has occurred immediately before the\r\npatient’s death, there will be found coagulated blood upon the bones\r\nand in the fissures. If the patient has survived for some time, there\r\nwill be marks of inflammation and, perhaps, pus in contact with the\r\nskull, but if a fracture has been made in making the examination,\r\nwhich sometimes happens in even very careful dissectors’ hands, the\r\nblood in the fracture will not be coagulated, nor will there be any\r\neffusions around the portions. In Beck’s _Medical Journal_, Vol.\r\nXXII., p. 28, Mr. Alcock some time since stated in a public lecture in\r\nLondon that he had known a fracture of the base of the skull produced\r\nby the awkward and violent tearing of the upper portion by the saw in\r\npenetrating enough to divide the bones, and this to be mistaken by the\r\ninexperienced operator for fracture of the skull producing death. Being\r\na medico-legal case, it might have led to melancholy consequences had\r\nnot the error been detected by an observer.” That an extensive and\r\noften complicated fracture by _contre coup_ can occur as the result of\r\ngunshot injuries of the skull is a fact well known to all surgeons of\r\nexperience and laid down in all text-books and illustrated in all large\r\nmuseums.\r\n\r\nIn view of these well-known facts, it would always be well to insist\r\nin cases of this kind that the saw alone should be used and not the\r\nhammer nor the chisel. When a cranial bone is fractured blood is\r\npoured out from the ruptured vessels, as is always the case with any\r\nbone. Its amount varies indefinitely with the number and size of the\r\nruptured vessels, the activity of circulation, the length of time a\r\nperson lives, etc. The blood may collect in circumscribed masses or\r\nbecome infiltrated in the surrounding tissues, although usually both\r\nphenomena are observed. The extent to which infiltration takes place\r\ndepends upon the quantity of blood and the nature of the surrounding\r\ntissues. In loose tissues like those about the orbit infiltration is\r\nmuch more rapid and extensive.\r\n\r\n=Examination of the Weapon.=—French medical jurists have tried to\r\nindicate how we may determine the time elapsed between the death of a\r\nperson and the discharge of a weapon found near the body, but exact\r\nstatements in this matter are utterly out of the question. Certain\r\nfacts bearing on the subject are these: When recently discharged there\r\nwill be found adhering to the barrel of the piece and consisting of the\r\nfouling of which sportsmen complain, a quantity of potassium sulfid\r\nmixed with charcoal. This is shown by its forming a strong alkaline\r\nsolution with water, evolving an odor of hydrogen sulfid, and a dark\r\nprecipitate with a solution of acetate of lead. Depending upon the\r\ndegree of exposure to air and moisture, after some hours or days this\r\nsulfid becomes converted into potassium sulfate, which forms a neutral\r\nsolution with water and gives a white precipitate with acetate of lead;\r\nbut if a considerable time has elapsed since the discharge of the piece\r\noxid of iron (iron rust) with traces of sulfate may be found (_Ann.\r\nd’Hygiene_, 1834, p. 458; 1837, p. 197; 1842, p. 368).\r\n\r\nWAS THE WEAPON FIRED FROM A DISTANCE OR NEAR BY?—A gunshot injury\r\nfrom a bullet implies at least one wound, namely, that of entrance,\r\nand perhaps another, that of exit. It does not always happen that the\r\nbullet passes through the body. The appearance of the wound of entrance\r\nis usually one of irregular circular puncture, its edges perhaps\r\nslightly torn or lacerated, with a purplish or dark areola, varying in\r\nwidth from a line or two to one-half inch. When the weapon is fired\r\nclose to the body there are likely to be more or less powder-marks,\r\nand possibly actual burning from the heat and flame of the gunpowder.\r\nIf the part of the body injured had been covered by clothing at the\r\ntime, the marks of powder and of burning would probably be confined to\r\nthe same. Bleeding is usually slight and occurs more commonly from the\r\nwound of entrance than from that of exit. Regularity of either of these\r\nwounds depends in large measure upon the angle at which the bullet has\r\nstruck the surface. When striking very obliquely the wound may be more\r\noval or the bullet may have ploughed a furrow or a channel, by a study\r\nof which the relative position of the assailant and the assailed at\r\nthe moment of injury may, perhaps, be determined. It is of importance\r\nto determine if possible the approximate distance at which the bullet\r\nwas fired, since the question of self-defence, for instance, may hinge\r\nupon evidence of this character. The charge of powder and the weight of\r\nthe bullet being known, one may sometimes estimate this distance by the\r\ndepth of penetration or the appearance of the bullet. Still, the nature\r\nof the tissues must figure largely in such consideration. Many suicides\r\nwho shoot themselves in the head show only one wound of entrance and\r\nnone of exit.\r\n\r\n=Experiments Testing Powder-Marks.=—Powder-marks and burns from\r\nweapons ordinarily used will scarcely appear when the distance has\r\nexceeded ten or twelve feet. LaChese, of Antwerp, found that in\r\nfiring a gun even from a distance of only four feet the skin was only\r\npartially blackened.\r\n\r\nAs the result of experiments made with a Ballard rifle, old style, .44\r\ncalibre, with bullets of 220 grains and 28 grains of powder, Dr. Balch,\r\nof Albany, found that powder-marks were made at distances as follows:\r\n\r\nAt two feet, particles too numerous to count, with some of the\r\nlubricant blown upon the board;\r\n\r\nAt four feet the same;\r\n\r\nAt six feet the same;\r\n\r\nAt eight feet, nine grains of powder;\r\n\r\nAt ten feet, five grains of powder in one case and six in another.\r\n\r\nThat these were powder-grains were shown in court by picking some\r\nof them out, placing them on a glass, and igniting them with a\r\ngalvano-caustic point. From those at ten feet no distinct flash could\r\nbe elicited; from those obtained at eight feet distinct flashes were\r\nseen (Trans. New York State Med. Soc., 1881).\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated case of Peytle, brought in 1839 for the murder of his\r\nwife, who had been killed by two bullets entering near the nose, the\r\neyebrows, lashes, and lids were completely burned, and a large number\r\nof powder grains were imbedded in the cheeks. Experiments being made\r\nin order to ascertain the distance necessary to produce these effects,\r\nit was found that the weapon must have been held within a distance of\r\ntwelve inches.\r\n\r\n=Wounds of Entrance and of Exit.=—A great deal has been written in\r\ntime past about the peculiarities of the wounds of entrance and of\r\nexit, much of which cannot be maintained under expert criticism. It is\r\ntrue that the wound of entrance will usually be well defined, the skin\r\nslightly depressed and appearing as above noted. It is true also that\r\npowder-marks will appear about this wound rather than that of exit.\r\nUsually, too, the orifice of exit is larger, less regular, its edges\r\neverted slightly, with more or less laceration of the skin, and quite\r\nfree from any powder-marks or evidence of burning. The depression at\r\nthe border of the wound of entrance differs after some days, by which\r\ntime the contused margins slough away, and its appearance is daily\r\nchanged by a process of granulation providing the individual recover\r\nor live long enough. According to Dupuytren, the hole in the clothing\r\nis smaller than that made by the same bullet in the skin. These are\r\nall points worth remembering when fitting bullets into wounds which\r\nthey are supposed to have made; but the conditions under which gunshot\r\npunctures occur are constantly varying, and the significance of local\r\nmarkings is mainly the product of experience, care, observation,\r\nand reasoning. Thus the shape of either of these wounds will depend\r\nnaturally upon the integrity of the bullet and its original shape\r\nand dimensions. Matthysen’s experiments give the following: A pistol\r\nfired at twelve paces distance, with a ball 15 mm. in diameter, made\r\na wound in chest of 8¼ mm. diameter, and at its point of exit at the\r\nback one of 10 mm. In two experiments at the same distance as above,\r\nthe entrance wound was 4 mm. larger in diameter than that of exit, and\r\nwhen a larger ball with a diameter of 17 mm. was used the same results\r\nwere preserved, both wounds being less in size than the ball which made\r\nthem. A spherical ball will usually cause more loss of substance than\r\na conical, while the latter will cause usually more irregularity of\r\noutline and may even give the wound of entrance a slit-like appearance.\r\nComplications may also occur from other sources; a single wound of\r\nentrance may give rise to two or more wounds of exit due to splitting\r\nof the bullet, or if the bullet have been divided and the larger part\r\nlodged in the bone, only the smaller portion passing out, the wound\r\nof exit may in reality be much smaller than that of entrance. Again,\r\na bullet may split into fragments before striking the body, and of\r\nthese one may enter the body, or one or more of them lodge. Multiple\r\nwounds are possible even from one bullet, as when it passes through\r\ntwo different parts of the body. Again, when two wounds, for instance,\r\nare discovered, one of them may be regarded as that of exit, when in\r\nreality they may be two wounds of entrance, neither bullet having left\r\nthe body. So while it is possible in some cases to decide which is\r\nwhich, too much dependence should not be placed upon appearances of\r\nthis kind, least of all until after a careful autopsy has been made.\r\n\r\n=Course of the Projectile.=—When a bullet traverses a body the two\r\napertures may be nearly opposite to each other, although the bullet\r\nmay not have taken a direct course between them, having been deflected\r\nby tissues of varying density in its course. This leads to the mention\r\nof the effect of animal tissues upon the course of bullets, with which\r\nworks on military surgery deal extensively.\r\n\r\nThe following is a remarkable illustration, yet authentic, of a\r\ndevious path of a ball. In a duel with pistols between two students\r\nat Strasburg one fell, apparently mortally wounded in the neck, but\r\nrecovered without feeling any inconvenience from his wound. It was\r\nfound that the bullet had struck the larynx and had gone completely\r\naround the neck. It was taken out by simply making an incision over it.\r\nOther instances may be cited where bullets have made a circuit around\r\nthe head, thorax, or abdomen. The ball may make a half circuit of the\r\nbody and lodge or emerge at a point opposite that at which it entered,\r\nthus leading one to suppose that it must have passed directly through\r\n(Wharton and Stille).\r\n\r\nAs the writer of a chapter on the effect of projectiles of small-arms,\r\nin the Third Surgical Volume of the “Medical and Surgical History of\r\nthe War of the Rebellion,” p. 709, says: “Such bullets attain great\r\nrange and effectiveness as oppose least frontage of resistance to air;\r\ntheir velocity consequently is greater. Rotation upon their long axes\r\ntends to give them steadier flight and more direct course. By their\r\npointed apices they pierce more easily the structures opposed to them.\r\nSuch bullets, owing to the elasticity of the skin, make a wound of\r\nentrance perhaps a trifle smaller in diameter than themselves, while\r\nspherical balls are more likely to carry a portion of the integument in\r\nwith them.”\r\n\r\nThe differences of structure and density of the muscle tissues and\r\ntheir aponeuroses encountered by a bullet in its passage materially\r\ninfluence the directness of its course unless its velocity be very\r\ngreat, while round bullets are the more easily deflected from their\r\ncourse. The track of a small conical bullet passing swiftly through\r\na muscle is more cleanly cut than that made by a round bullet, but\r\nin all gunshot wounds there is usually found a regular canal, with\r\nlacerated walls, with more or less destruction along the area of\r\ninjury, shading off concentrically until lost in healthy tissue. There\r\nis always loss of substance dependent on muscle tension or direction\r\nof the bullet, whether transverse or obliquely to the direction of\r\nthe muscle fibres; the more fibrous structures are torn and lacerated\r\nor simply perforated, mainly owing to their different tension at the\r\ninstant; their openings seldom correspond to those of the muscle\r\ntissues or those upon the surface of the body, because of the constant\r\nchange in the relation of the parts due to muscle action. This makes\r\nit often difficult to follow the course of a bullet with accuracy. The\r\nirregularity of a bullet-track due to these causes constitutes one of\r\nthe great sources of danger, since cavities and pouches thus formed\r\ngive lodgment to foreign matter driven in with the bullet, by retention\r\nof which a fertile source of sepsis is maintained. Gunshot injuries\r\nof bone may be classified as contusions, simple fractures, partial\r\nfractures, penetrations, perforations, and complete fractures with more\r\nor less comminution or loss of substance, all of these, of course, in\r\nthe surgical sense compound. These are all manifestations of mechanical\r\nforce acting in accordance with established laws. On autopsy these will\r\nbe ascertained, while one or more portions or all of a bullet may be\r\nfound imbedded in or attached to some bone. The best illustration of\r\nsuch accidents will be found in the “Medical and Surgical History of\r\nthe War of the Rebellion.”\r\n\r\nSuch questions as pertain to the position of the wounded person when\r\nshot or that of his antagonist, and other similar inquiries, can only\r\nbe settled by reference to particular circumstances of individual\r\ncases. Position of the wound may help a little. A bullet-wound directly\r\nin the centre of the top of the head could scarcely be received by a\r\nperson standing unless his assailant occupied an elevated position. If\r\naccompanied by evidence of severe blows by which the deceased might\r\nhave been knocked down, it might show that he had been shot after\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\n=Wounds by Small Shot.=—Small shot rarely traverse the entire body\r\nunless discharged from such proximity as to make a clean, round\r\nopening. Paley relates the following instance: A boy was shot in the\r\nneck by the accidental explosion of his own gun, No. 8 shot. He died\r\ninstantly. He was lying forward of the muzzle so that it was nearly in\r\ncontact with the skin of the neck. A large round hole was produced, in\r\ndiameter one and one-half inches, whose edges were slightly darkened\r\nby powder. The wound of exit at the back of the neck, at the third\r\nvertebra, was a mere slit in the skin scarcely an inch in length with\r\nthe diameter placed vertically. The smallness of this aperture may\r\nhave been owing to the greater part of the charge being lodged in the\r\nbody. Dr. Lowe states that in some experiments it was found that a\r\nround aperture might be produced by a discharge of small shot at a\r\nmuch greater distance than that assigned by Dr. LaChese, namely, ten\r\nto twelve inches. Even admitting such exceptional instances, it will\r\nscarcely ever occur that a wound from a small shot can be mistaken for\r\none produced by a leaden bullet.\r\n\r\nDe Vergie has shown that when the ball enters a portion of the body\r\nwell covered with fat, this often protrudes between the edges of the\r\nwound and may alter its character. If clothing have been carried in\r\nsome shreds of it may show upon the wound, and such fragments of\r\ntexture will nearly always characterize the wound at once as that of\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\n=Wounds by Blank Charges.=—Experience has shown that no matter with\r\nwhat the piece is charged, it is capable, when fired close by, of\r\nproducing a wound which may prove fatal. Thus a gun loaded with wadding\r\nor gunpowder only may cause death. A portion of clothing may be carried\r\ninto the wound and lead to death from hemorrhage, or death may occur\r\nfrom many secondary causes, such as tetanus or sepsis. Accidents so\r\nfrequently occur from weapons discharged in sport, not loaded with\r\nball or shot, that it is worth while to bear this in mind. It has been\r\nobserved, for instance, that persons attempting to commit suicide have\r\nforgotten to put a bullet in the pistol, nevertheless the discharge\r\nof the weapon into the mouth has sufficed, from the wadding alone,\r\nto produce a considerable laceration and hemorrhage (Taylor). Many\r\nfatal accidents have taken place by the discharge of wadding from\r\ncannon. LaChese has ascertained by experiment that a piece charged with\r\ngunpowder alone is capable of producing a penetrating wound somewhat\r\nresembling that produced by gunshot, when the piece is large and\r\nfired within six feet of the body (_Ann. d’Hygiene_, 1836, p. 368).\r\nThis arises from unexploded grains of powder acting as pellets of\r\nsmall shot. Sweet has experimented with pistols loaded with gunpowder\r\nand wadding in order to determine the effect of their discharge at\r\ndifferent distances. At twelve inches he found that the clothing was\r\nlacerated and the skin abraded, but the wadding did not penetrate; at\r\nsix inches the clothes were lacerated and the wadding penetrated to\r\nthe depth of one-half inch; at one and one-half inches from the chest\r\nthe wadding passed into the thoracic cavity between the ribs, and at a\r\nsecond experiment carried away a portion of the ribs.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that an ordinary wadding such as loosely wrapped paper,\r\nrag, or similar material, especially as prepared by one not accustomed\r\nto military use of a weapon, would not produce a wound which would\r\nresemble that made by a bullet, and it is doubtful whether such a wound\r\ncould be produced at a greater distance than six inches from the body.\r\n\r\nIt is on record that in Paris, in 1858, a circus cannon of four inches\r\nbore, loaded with three ounces of grain powder retained by a wad of\r\nold theatre bills loosely folded together and rammed home with only\r\nmoderate force, was discharged in the direction of the boxes at a\r\ndistance of about one hundred and fifty feet. A man seated in one of\r\nthese boxes opposite the muzzle of the gun, leaning forward, his arms\r\ncrossed upon the handle of his umbrella, had his arm broken above the\r\nelbow immediately upon its discharge. Several portions of wadding\r\nwere found beneath the place where the man sat, but no marks existed\r\nupon his clothing nor upon the anterior part of the arm, which must\r\nhave been inaccessible to any projectile that did not first strike\r\nthe forearm. It was concluded that the fracture had been caused by\r\nthe violent and sudden starting of the man backward, which must have\r\nbrought his arm against the hard part of the partition. An experiment\r\ntried with the cannon proved that any wadding that could be made with\r\npaper was dispersed in passing, or lost all power of mischief, at much\r\nless distance than one hundred and twenty feet (_Annales d’Hygiene_,\r\n1859, p. 420, Wharton and Stille).\r\n\r\n=The Mannlicher Rifle.=—It may be of interest here to note the effects\r\nof the rifle-bullets used in the most recently invented improved\r\narms. The last new projectile used in the German army, 1892, with the\r\nMannlicher rifle, has an inner core of lead inclosed in a casing of\r\nsteel or firm metal, which prevents the lead, even when softened by\r\nheat, from becoming deformed and enlarged by contact. The weight of\r\nthe bullet is much less than any of the old, but to its higher rate of\r\nvelocity and its pointed shape, which is preserved, must be ascribed\r\nits greater perforating power. Owing to this immense velocity and the\r\nsmall surface of contact, it meets with little resistance on striking\r\na person, has no time to stretch the various tissues it encounters,\r\ncauses little or no commotion of the neighboring parts, and merely\r\npunches a hole, carrying the contused elements before it clear out\r\nof the wound without seriously damaging the surrounding wall of the\r\nbullet-track. This absence of contusion must lead to more frequent\r\ndeaths from hemorrhage, while when this arm is used we shall hear very\r\nlittle of deflection or deviation of the bullet from its path, since\r\nit has sufficient power to pass directly through any part of the body\r\nwhich it may meet on its way. The result in battle will be a reduction\r\nof the list of wounded, but a terrible augmentation of that of the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTITY FROM A FLASH OF GUNPOWDER.\r\n\r\nTaylor states the following: “Among the singular questions which have\r\narisen out of this subject is the following: whether the person who\r\nfires a gun or pistol during a dark night can be identified by means\r\nof the light produced during the discharge. This question was first\r\nnegatively answered by a class in physical science in France, whereas\r\nlater a case tending to show that their decision was erroneous was\r\nsubsequently reported by Fodere. A woman positively swore that she\r\nsaw the face of the prisoner, who fired at another during the night,\r\nsurrounded by a kind of glory, and that she was thereby enabled to\r\nidentify him. This statement was confirmed by the deposition of the\r\nwounded party. Desgranges, of Lyons, performed many experiments on\r\nthis subject, and he concluded that away from every source of light\r\nthe prisoner who fired the gun might be identified within a moderate\r\ndistance; if the flash were very strong, the smoke very dense, and the\r\ndistance great, the person firing the piece could not be identified.\r\nThe question was raised in England in the case of Reg. _v._ White at\r\nthe Croydon Autumn Assizes, 1839. A gentleman was shot at while driving\r\nhome on a dark night, being wounded in the leg. When he saw the flash\r\nof the gun he saw that the piece was levelled toward him, and the\r\nlight of the flash enabled him to recognize at once the features of\r\nthe accused. In cross-examination he said he was quite sure he could\r\nsee the prisoner and was not mistaken as to his identity; but the\r\naccused was skilfully defended and he was acquitted. A similar case was\r\ntried at the Lewes Lent Assizes, 1862, Reg. _v._ Stapley. The prisoner\r\nshot at the prosecutor on a dark December evening, and the latter\r\nswore that he distinctly saw the prisoner by the flash of the gun and\r\ncould identify him by the light on his features. His evidence was\r\ncorroborated and the man was convicted. A case is also quoted, Rex _v._\r\nHaines, in which some police officials were shot at by a highwayman\r\nduring a dark night. One of these stated that he could distinctly see\r\nfrom the flash of the pistol that the robber rode a dark-brown horse\r\nof remarkable shape, and that he had since identified the horse at a\r\nstable in London. He also was positive that the prisoner had on a rough\r\nbrown great-coat.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be enough evidence in this direction to show that\r\nidentification under these circumstances is occasionally possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL MEDICO-LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe result of the wonderful advance in the practice of surgery\r\nmade during the past fifteen years has been in a large measure to\r\nrevolutionize the treatment of gunshot wounds, and inasmuch as the\r\nresult of many homicidal attempts will depend in large measure upon\r\nwhat the surgeon can do for the victim of assault, it may not be amiss\r\nto very briefly epitomize in this place something of what modern\r\nsurgeons believe with regard to the best treatment of bullet-wounds,\r\nexpressed in a general way. They have learned, among other things,\r\nthat the harm which a bullet does is done by it during its flight, and\r\nthat after it has come to a stop it is, _per se_, an almost invariably\r\nharmless foreign body. This is practically always the case unless it\r\nhas carried in with it foreign material which may serve as a source of\r\nseptic infection.\r\n\r\nIn time past there has always been a strong feeling, which had,\r\nhowever, nothing scientific to justify it, that every gunshot wound was\r\na poisoned one. Of late, since bacteriology has attained the proportion\r\nof a science, it has been held that bullets were necessarily sterilized\r\nby the heat of the discharge of powder behind them. Very recently\r\nDr. B. Von Beck, Medical Director of the 14th German Army Corps, has\r\nmade experiments upon the amount of heat imparted to leaden and other\r\nbullets after firing. After making an allowance for specific heat and\r\nthe conductivity of the different metals used, he found that even when\r\nthe projectiles encountered resistance from three to four times greater\r\nthan that offered by the human body the results were as follows:\r\nTemperature of leaden bullets of .45 calibre, when recovered, 69° C.;\r\nof .30 calibre, covered with steel, when recovered, 78° C.; of .30\r\ncalibre, covered with copper, when recovered, 101° C. He states that\r\nthese experiments disprove the theory that certain lesions in wounds\r\ncan be in any way attributed to the heat imparted by the bullet.\r\n\r\nWhile these experiments prove that the bullets may be heated to the\r\nabove degrees when recovered, they by no means prove that they are so\r\nheated at the time when they inflicted the wound. During the year 1892\r\nsome very interesting experiments were carried on by Dr. Lagarde, of\r\nthe Army Medical Department (_New York Medical Journal_, Oct. 22d,\r\n1892, p. 458). He experimented by deliberately infecting bullets and\r\nthen firing them into cotton, and animals as well, studying the effect\r\nboth on the bullets themselves and upon the animals. Some of these\r\nbullets were taken from the original packages, while others had been\r\nintentionally rolled in dirt. The experiments were carefully carried\r\nout and appear reliable, and the conclusions given by the author, which\r\ninterest us here, are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The vast majority of cartridges in original packages are sterile\r\nor free from septic germs because of the disinfection and absolute\r\ncleanliness observed in the process of their manufacture.\r\n\r\n(2) The majority of gunshot wounds are aseptic because the vast\r\nmajority of the projectiles inflicting them are either sterile or free\r\nfrom septic germs.\r\n\r\n(3) The heat developed by the act of firing is not sufficient to\r\ndestroy all the organic matter of the projectile, the cherished notions\r\nof three centuries or more to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nThe results as set forth justify the assumption that a septic bullet\r\n_can_ infect a gunshot wound. The average bullet-wound, however,\r\nis sterile so far as infection from the bullet is concerned, and\r\nin accordance with this view of its usual innocence there need be\r\nno longer the clamor for removal of the missile which the fears of\r\nprevious generations have nearly always called for; and the best\r\npractice among _military surgeons_ of to-day is rather to let the\r\nbullet remain where lodged than to make a more serious wound for its\r\nremoval. Exceptions to this rule occur only in cases where operation\r\nis called for on account of injury done by the bullet while still in\r\nmotion. It is also held to be a violation of simple physiological\r\nand surgical rules to probe or carelessly search for a bullet whose\r\nlocation cannot be made out from a study of signs and symptoms in a\r\ngiven case. The act of probing breaks up blood-clot, often brings on\r\nfresh hemorrhage, is in a majority of cases unsatisfactory, frequently\r\nintroduces specific elements from without, and really gives little, if\r\nany, more information than can be gathered from a study of the case\r\nwithout the use of the probe. If every ordinary bullet-wound which did\r\nnot call for immediate operation because of injury to some essential\r\nor vital part—such as a large blood-vessel or nerve-trunk, or some of\r\nthe viscera—were antiseptically and hermetically sealed at the very\r\noutset, there would be a much smaller percentage of death from gunshot\r\nwounds, either in civil or military practice, than now obtains. And it\r\nmight be a matter upon which to go to the jury whether violation of\r\nsuch rules, to-day, does not mitigate the offence of the accused.\r\n\r\nRecent discoveries in so-called cerebral localization have instigated\r\nnumerous operations upon the skull and brain for the relief of\r\npressure, as from blood-clot, or for removal of depressed bone or a\r\nbullet which twenty years ago would have been impossible. The brain is\r\nno longer the _terra incognita_ of the past generation of medical men,\r\nand it is now often possible for the surgeon to intervene in such a way\r\nas to save life in cases previously considered hopeless; in fact, such\r\nis now his duty when consent can be gained, and it should be held that\r\nhe is culpable when deficient in general knowledge in this respect.\r\n\r\nIn wounds of the thoracic cavity it should now be held that so long\r\nas air has entered through a bullet-wound there are cases where free\r\nincision, even with removal of ribs, can scarcely increase the dangers,\r\nwhile permitting opportunity for much more accurate exploration and\r\ndetermination of life-saving methods. The experiments of numerous\r\ninvestigators, the writer included, have shown that bullet-wounds of\r\nthe heart need not be always and invariably fatal, and have afforded\r\nan element of hope from the possible surgery of even this organ. The\r\nwriter looks forward to the time when some accomplished yet daring\r\nsurgeon, getting the right patient at the right time and in the right\r\nplace, _i.e._, where conveniences are at hand, shall, in some case of\r\nperforating wound of the pericardium or of the heart itself, resect\r\nsome portion of the anterior thoracic wall, lay open the pericardium,\r\nmaintaining meanwhile artificial respiration if necessary, and suture\r\na wound in the heart-substance, thereafter closing the pericardium\r\nand external wound, and save life which would otherwise be surely\r\nsacrificed. With others he has done this upon animals, hence why may it\r\nnot be done in man?\r\n\r\nIn the mean time for, first, the recognition and, second, the surgical\r\ntreatment of perforating wounds of the abdominal viscera, American\r\nsurgeons have won for themselves the greatest credit, and an already\r\nlong list of successful laparotomies after gunshot wounds of the\r\nintestines, with intestinal suture or resection, has shown the very\r\ngreat value of this procedure, even though it has kept some would-be\r\nmurderers from the gallows.\r\n\r\nThese lines are inserted here because the time and effort which\r\nsurgeons have devoted to this kind of surgery deserve only the highest\r\nencomiums and encouragement from the legal profession, although to our\r\ndeep regret they have not always met with the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE VARIOUS CONDITIONS WHICH COMPLICATE GUNSHOT WOUNDS AND MAKE\r\nTHEIR RESULTS UNCERTAIN,\r\n\r\n=Delirium Tremens= is one of the commonest and must always be\r\nregarded as one of the most serious. It is well known to surgeons\r\nthat a slight injury even, and often a severe one, is enough to\r\nprovoke manifestations of this character in intemperate persons. The\r\nmedico-legal question under these circumstances is this: Would the\r\nsame amount of injury have been likely to cause death in a person of\r\nordinary health and vigor? The law as applied to these cases has been\r\nstated by Lord Hale: “It is sufficient to prove that the death of a\r\nperson was accelerated by the malicious acts of the person, although\r\nthe former labored under a mental disease at the time of the act. The\r\nintent of the accused may often be judged by the character of the wound\r\nand the means of its infliction. Drunkenness of the victim admits of\r\nno excuse when his assailant is aware, or ought to have been aware,\r\nof the condition of his victim. It is held that the assailant ought\r\nto have known that violence of any kind to such a person is likely to\r\nbe attended by dangerous results. It is known also that a wound which\r\naccelerates death causes death.” The commissioners who were appointed\r\nto define criminal law on the subject of homicide have thus expressed\r\nthemselves: “Art. 3. It is homicide although the effect of the injury\r\nbe merely to accelerate the death of one laboring under some previous\r\ninjury or infirmity, for although if timely remedies or skilful\r\ntreatment had been applied, death might have been prevented” (Taylor,\r\np. 327).\r\n\r\n=Death from Surgical Operations Necessitated by Gunshot Wound.=—The\r\nmodern treatment of serious or so-called penetrating gunshot wounds\r\nwhere the cranium, thoracic viscera, or the abdominal viscera,\r\nespecially the intestines, have been perforated one or more times,\r\ncalls for surgical procedures which are of severity and danger in\r\nproportion to the gravity of the wound which necessitates them, and\r\nwhich, while they often save life, must necessarily often fail. Indeed,\r\nsuch operations may prove fatal upon the operating-table, _i.e._,\r\npatients may die before the conclusion of the operation. The question\r\nmay, therefore, arise whether the person who inflicted the wound should\r\nbe held responsible for his act, or whether by the intervention of\r\nthe surgeon the responsibility may not at least be shifted from the\r\nshoulders of the accused. The law in this respect is explicit and\r\nregards such operation as the outcome of necessity and a legitimate\r\npart of treatment, so that if it be undertaken in good faith, with\r\nreasonable care and skill, the accused will be held responsible, be the\r\nresult what it may. The question of necessity and the plan of operation\r\nare left to the judgment of the surgeon in charge. Considering the\r\nresponsibility involved in such cases and the possibility of a suit\r\nbeing raised, we should always advise the operator to secure the\r\ncounsel of other surgeons or practitioners in his vicinity. The\r\nverdict of such a counsel of talent will always stand. According to\r\nLord Hale, when death takes place from an unskilful operation under\r\nsuch circumstances, and not from the wound, the responsibility of\r\nthe prisoner naturally ceases, but the burden of proof that such has\r\nbeen unskilfully performed rests naturally with the defence. It is\r\nmuch better also in these cases that the primary responsibility be\r\nborne by one surgeon from the beginning of the case, though he may\r\nassociate with himself as many others as he chooses, since the ends\r\nof justice have more than once been defeated by a division of such\r\nresponsibilities. Should it be made to appear that the surgeon in\r\ncharge has not availed himself of such means as are supposed to be in\r\nthe hands of every competent practitioner and has neglected ordinary\r\nantiseptic precautions, it would not be difficult to show that the\r\noperation had been unskilfully performed, and the prisoner would\r\nnaturally get the benefit of such defence. At the present date of\r\nwriting there exists a large class of the profession who still continue\r\nto do surgery according to the views and practices of twenty or thirty\r\nyears ago, and who, while perhaps carrying out some of the forms of\r\nantiseptic surgery, are still ignorant of its fundamental principles\r\nand consequently guilty of neglect, since there is now no reason why\r\nall should not practise them. The writer holds to the view that if it\r\ncan be shown that these precautions were not adopted when others would\r\nhave adopted them, it constitutes criminal neglect.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, circumstances may arise where a simple or a more\r\nserious operation would have saved life, as, for instance, in cases\r\nof hemorrhage, and where a surgeon from timidity or carelessness\r\nhas failed to take the necessary steps. Such neglect as this should\r\ninure to the benefit of the accused, but when at any time it can be\r\nshown that the possible benefits of operation have been offered to\r\nthe deceased before his death and have been declined, the surgeon at\r\nleast is relieved of all further responsibility. Among the dangers of\r\noperations under these circumstances are of course to be reckoned those\r\npertaining to the use of anæsthetics. The surgeon in charge, however,\r\nis responsible for the selection of his assistants, at least when\r\nassistants are at hand, and must be regarded as equally competent in\r\nthis as in other features of the operation; and even though the patient\r\ndie from collapse or the anæsthetic, the burden of proof must rest with\r\nthe defence to show that it had been unskilfully administered.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The assistance which the microscope may afford in the\r\nprocurement of evidence in cases of gunshot wound is beautifully\r\nillustrated in the expert testimony reported by Dr. James, of St.\r\nLouis, in the presidential address before the American Society of\r\nMicroscopists, in Washington, August, 1891, printed in Vol. XIII. of\r\nits Transactions. It occurred in St. Louis, in the case of The People\r\n_v._ Vail, who had a pistol in his pocket at the instant when his wife\r\nfell from a wagon against him, knocking him, as he claimed, against\r\nthe wheel of the wagon, the pistol being discharged by accident. By\r\na minute study of the fibres of the various textures making up his\r\novercoat and of the effect of the explosion of powder upon textile\r\nfabrics almost in contact with it, he was enabled to establish the\r\naccident and secure the acquittal of the accused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEATH\r\n\r\n  BY HEAT AND COLD,\r\n\r\n  INCLUDING\r\n\r\n  INSOLATION IN ITS MEDICO-LEGAL ASPECTS.\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n  ENOCH V. STODDARD, A.M., M.D.,\r\n\r\n  _Emeritus Professor of Materia Medica and Hygiene in the University\r\n  of Buffalo_; _Member of the Medical Society of the State of New York\r\n  and of the Central New York Medical Association_; _Fellow of the New\r\n  York Academy of Medicine and of the American Academy of Medicine_;\r\n  _Late Surgeon 65th Regt. N. Y. Vols._; _Late\r\n  Health Commissioner, Rochester,\r\n  N. Y._; _etc., etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH BY HEAT AND COLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\nThe production and regulation of heat in the body is a problem by\r\nno means elucidated. We consider heat production to be of internal\r\norigin, by a complex process involving tissue metamorphosis, chemical\r\nchanges in nutrient elements, muscular movements, etc. Heat regulation\r\nis accomplished, not only by variation in the loss of heat by the\r\nbody, but by what is more important, variations in the amount of heat\r\ngenerated. It is an accepted physiological conclusion that there exists\r\nin the body a thermotaxic nervous mechanism which controls its normal,\r\nas well as its abnormal, manifestations of heat.\r\n\r\nThe average temperature of the body in health is 37° C. (98.6° F.), in\r\nthe axilla. Taken in the vagina or rectum, .9° C. (1.3° F.) higher is\r\nnoted. The daily average range of variation is about 1° C. (1.8° F.).\r\n\r\nIn disease or injury considerable variations occur; very high, as well\r\nas very low, temperatures are met. In severe neuroses and some forms of\r\nmalarial disease a temperature of 42.2° C. (115° F.) has been recorded,\r\nand after an injury 71° C. (122° F.).[688]\r\n\r\nVery low temperatures are reported in several cases of acute\r\nalcoholism, accompanied by exposure to cold, where a temperature of\r\n28.8° C. (75° F.) in the rectum was noted, recovery following.[689]\r\n\r\nSuch extreme temperatures, though authentic, are exceptional.\r\n\r\nVery high temperatures in febrile conditions are borne because\r\nremitting; and low temperatures, subject to periods of elevation,\r\nare met in wasting and other conditions. Very high and very low\r\ntemperatures are also noted, just before death, in acute diseases and\r\nconditions specially involving the nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which the temperature may be raised without destroying\r\nlife has been investigated by Berger, Bernard, Chossat, and others.[690]\r\n\r\nTheir experiments show that if an elevation of temperature of the body\r\n7.20° C. (13° F.) be maintained for any length of time in warm-blooded\r\nanimals, death ensues. Depression of the temperature of warm-blooded\r\nanimals 12° C. (20° F.), or even less than these degrees below the\r\nnormal, results fatally. Portions of the body may be frozen and yet,\r\nunder appropriate treatment, recover. But freezing of the whole body\r\nmust necessarily prove fatal.\r\n\r\nGreat differences in ability to endure extremes of heat and cold\r\nappear among different nations and in different individuals. The very\r\nyoung and the very old are unable to bear exposure to extreme cold.\r\nIn both, the capacity for heat production is low and the vital powers\r\nare soon enfeebled to a critical degree. The healthy adult can, with\r\nproper precautions, safely endure great extremes of heat and cold.\r\nThe experience of arctic explorers in the expeditions of Kane, Nares,\r\nGreely, and others has demonstrated the power of endurance, for a\r\nconsiderable period, of a temperature from 90° to 100° F. below the\r\nfreezing-point. On the other hand, laborers employed in pottery and\r\nother establishments, using ovens raised to 148° to 315° C. (300° to\r\n600° F.) or higher, are often exposed for some time without injury to\r\ntemperatures approaching these intense figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF EXTREME COLD.\r\n\r\nLegal inquiry into the conditions of death from cold occurs almost\r\nentirely in cases of unintentional exposure. Cold has been employed,\r\nhowever, with homicidal intent. The depressing influence of continued\r\nlow temperatures is observed in the death-rates of cities, in winters\r\nof protracted severity, where the proportionate mortality among\r\ninfants, the aged and enfeebled shows marked increase. While age is a\r\nprominent predisposing and contributing factor, other causes exist.\r\nExhaustion from severe and prolonged exertion, deprivation of food,\r\nintoxication, former illness, and other conditions of depression lessen\r\nthe powers of the body to resist cold. Thus an exposure which might be\r\nsafely borne in perfect health might result fatally in the same person\r\nin conditions of depression just referred to (Case 1).\r\n\r\nInvestigation may be demanded in case of the death of\r\n\r\nA. Young children.\r\n\r\nB. The injured.\r\n\r\nC. The insane.\r\n\r\n=A. In Young Children.=—This may be in the new-born or older children.\r\n\r\nIn the _new-born_ exposure to cold soon causes death, as warmth is\r\nessential to the life of the young being. The length of time necessary\r\nto a fatal issue is modified by several conditions. In the immature or\r\nprematurely born infant the resisting power is much less than in the\r\nchild born at full term and otherwise healthy. In cases of suspected\r\ninfanticide by exposure the question of the maturity of the child at\r\nbirth is to be decided. Careful examination of the place in which the\r\nbody was discovered should be made as to its lack of warmth; and the\r\ndegree of external cold at the time of probable exposure should be\r\nrecorded. The circumstances as to whether the exposure was inadvertent\r\nor accidental, as in cases of premature or unexpected delivery, or\r\nwhether from intentional and deliberate purpose or from culpable\r\nneglect, should be carefully considered. The post-mortem examination\r\nshould decide whether the appearances and conditions of the body are\r\nthose peculiar to death from cold (Case 2).\r\n\r\nDeath may occur from culpably careless exposure to cold, as a\r\ncontributory if not as a direct cause, in such conditions of\r\nenfeeblement. Criminal neglect to provide medical attendance, food, and\r\nother essentials has been proven in some cases of the so-called “faith\r\ncure” or “prayer cure.” Exposure may be resorted to with deliberate\r\nhomicidal intent. It may, in some cases of death, become an important\r\nlegal question to decide whether a studied and persistent neglect of\r\nthis nature may not have been followed, with the purpose of getting rid\r\nof a troublesome care (Cases 2 and 3).\r\n\r\n=B. Exposure of the injured or wounded=, thereby inducing some\r\ngrave condition or complication which under proper care would have\r\nbeen avoided, may raise an important question in injuries inflicted\r\nby another, with or without criminal intent. It is undeniable that\r\nserious or fatal results may follow a slight wound, otherwise trivial,\r\nwhere the injured person was subjected, accidentally or intentionally,\r\nto extreme cold for a considerable period. While such cases are\r\ncomparatively rare, they may demand investigation.\r\n\r\n=C. Exposure of the Insane.=—While it must be admitted that the\r\ninsane subject is usually indifferent to matters of temperature, death\r\nfrom exposure to cold may call for special examination. Carelessness,\r\nincompetence, or wilful neglect on the part of nurses or keepers of\r\ninsane hospitals, or deliberate criminal intent in such or others\r\nhaving the care of or an interest in the death of an insane person may\r\nlead to a judicial inquiry.\r\n\r\nSudden death has been reported as occurring, in several cases, _after\r\nthe ingestion of large quantities of cold water_ when the person was\r\ngreatly heated. It is somewhat difficult to explain all such cases\r\nreported on a single line of causation. Some observers have attributed\r\ndeath to syncope or asthenia by the shock produced, in the sudden\r\neffect of the cold upon the sympathetic nervous system inducing heart\r\nfailure. This seems the most natural explanation.\r\n\r\nOthers consider the causative factor to be the formation of thromboses\r\nin the capillaries of the brain, lungs, and other organs, inducing\r\nactive and obstructive congestions causing death by apnœa or coma.\r\nOthers regard these cases as similar to “heat apoplexy.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of external cold, the vessels of the skin are\r\ncontracted and the internal splanchnic areas dilated. Thus the surface\r\nof the body contains less blood and the internal organs a larger\r\nproportion. This vascular change is one of the important factors in\r\nmaintaining the uniform temperature of the body. The thermometer,\r\nplaced in the mouth, in such conditions frequently indicates a rise of\r\ntemperature. This is probably due, not only to the increased volume\r\nof blood collected in the internal organs, but also to an increased\r\nproduction of heat through a thermogenic action.\r\n\r\nIn exposure for a time to severe cold the nose, ears, cheeks, hands,\r\nfeet, and other portions of the body, after the first appearance of\r\ndusky lividity, become bloodless and white, lose sensation, and become\r\ncongealed; a condition known as “frost-bite.” From this, recovery\r\nwithout injury is possible under appropriate treatment, by which the\r\ntemperature is gradually raised and the circulation restored. Where\r\nthe latter result is not secured, the part becomes gangrenous and is\r\nultimately removed by a process of inflammation and sloughing.\r\n\r\nIf the application of cold be protracted and the temperature\r\nextreme, the loss of heat becomes rapid and symptoms of depression\r\nof the heart’s action appear. Painful sensations of the surface and\r\nother portions of the body are experienced, succeeded by impaired\r\nsensation and anæsthesia. The skin acquires a dusky, reddish, and\r\nlivid appearance, with the formation occasionally of vesicles or\r\nblisters. With the lessened sensation stiffness of the limbs appears,\r\ndue to failing muscular contractility. The congestion of the central\r\nportions of the nervous system induces a condition of advancing stupor,\r\nresulting in complete coma with ultimate suspension of respiration and\r\nthe heart’s action.\r\n\r\nDeath from exposure to cold may be rapid or slow. In cases of recovery\r\nthe period of reaction is a critical one. The depression of the heart\r\nis apt to continue, and gangrene of parts of the body is likely to\r\noccur. Ulcers and sores healing with difficulty develop in some cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of those who are suffering from the effects of extreme\r\ncold, the restoration of the congealed or “frost-bitten” portions of\r\nthe body should be gradually accomplished. Raising the temperature\r\nrapidly is liable to induce the death and destruction of the affected\r\nparts. Ice or snow should, at first, be rubbed upon the frozen part,\r\nto be succeeded later by cold water. The patient should be placed in\r\na cool room and distant from the fire or source of heat. As soon as\r\nwarmth begins to return the part should be enveloped in wool, cotton,\r\nor some substance of poor conducting powers. If the whole body be\r\nchilled, frictions of the surface with stimulating lotions are of\r\nbenefit, wrapping the person in woollen or fur coverings or garments\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nHot coffee or alcoholic stimulants are of value as restoratives, but\r\nthe latter are to be avoided during an exposure to cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.\r\n\r\nThe appearances indicative of death from cold are sufficiently marked\r\nto enable one to decide whether exposure to cold was the chief\r\ndetermining cause of death, provided that a careful consideration of\r\nthe circumstances of season, temperature, place, and other conditions\r\nbe also had.\r\n\r\nIn the examination of a body in a case of apparent death from cold, the\r\nlimbs and internal organs may be found frozen. It must be remembered\r\nthat this occurs after, not before, death; and the frozen condition\r\nmust not be mistaken for “rigor mortis.”\r\n\r\nIn cases where a body is found, in freezing conditions of atmosphere,\r\nshowing commencing putrefaction, the death must not be hastily\r\nattributed to cold, which prevents putrefaction. It is evident that if\r\ncold was the cause of death the temperature of the body had been raised\r\nsince that event, or, more probably, death occurred from other causes\r\nand the body remained some time before becoming frozen.\r\n\r\nThe finding of a body in the snow or frozen in severe weather must not\r\npreclude the search for other causes of death, such as apoplexy, etc.,\r\nwhich may have occurred anterior to the freezing.\r\n\r\nObservers generally have agreed upon the presence of certain\r\npost-mortem conditions in cases of death from cold.\r\n\r\nEXTERNALLY.—Upon the skin are found dusky reddish patches, irregular\r\nin outline, which are in sharp contrast with the general pallor of the\r\nsurface. Krajewskey,[691] Ogston,[692] Dieberg,[693] and others, in the\r\nseveral series of cases reported by them, all describe this condition.\r\nThe skin otherwise is pale.\r\n\r\nINTERNALLY.—The viscera, including the brain, are congested. The heart\r\ncontains a large quantity of blood in the cavities of both sides, and\r\nthe large vessels leading from it are also full. The color of the blood\r\nis a bright red, resembling its arterial hue. This condition has been\r\ngenerally noted and described; but some excellent observers have not\r\nreferred to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF EXTREME HEAT.\r\n\r\nThe application of moderate heat to the surface of the body causes\r\ndilatation of the cutaneous capillaries. In such application the\r\nexhalant and perspiratory function of the skin is increased, by which\r\nmeans a rise in general body temperature is prevented. If, however,\r\nsevere physical exertion accompany the exposure, a more pronounced\r\nresult is induced and a depressing effect upon the nervous system\r\nbecomes manifest. If the degree of heat be raised and the exertion\r\nincreased and prolonged, marked depression ensues. Under circumstances\r\nof quiet and rest a high degree of temperature is borne by man without\r\ndepression or discomfort, but with continued and severe muscular effort\r\nthe rise in animal temperature is productive of distress and depressing\r\nconditions. In the Turkish or Russian baths, in the healthy subject,\r\na temperature of 48.8° to 54.4° C. (120° to 130° F.) produces profuse\r\nperspiration but no depression, and a plunge in or affusion of cold\r\nwater is not only borne with impunity but is acceptable. In conditions\r\nof heat accompanied by physical exhaustion, such sudden exposure to\r\ncold would prove extremely dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn the condition of rest, exposed to external heat, the tendency to\r\nelevation of body temperature arises from the external causes alone,\r\nwhich in no way specially modify the nutritive functions. But in the\r\nsecond condition the internal processes of nutrition, which have been\r\nsubject to great stimulation, are suddenly embarrassed by suppression\r\nof the compensating activity of the cutaneous surface, and severe\r\norganic and nervous derangements follow.\r\n\r\nIn the summer season the temperature rises to 32.3° C. (90° F.) and\r\neven much higher in certain localities. During the prevalence of such\r\nheat, the mortality among young children, the aged and enfeebled is\r\nvery marked; these two periods of life being very susceptible to the\r\ndepressing effects of heat. A high temperature is easily borne if the\r\nair be pure and the atmosphere be not saturated with moisture. Telluric\r\nelectric conditions also have a modifying influence, undoubted though\r\nobscure.\r\n\r\nIn certain occupations an intensely heated atmosphere is endured with\r\nimpunity for a considerable time, provided the air be maintained in a\r\ncondition of purity and water be supplied to the person exposed. The\r\nstokers upon ocean steam-ships, where a forced draught is employed, are\r\nsubjected to extreme heat, sometimes reaching 60° C. (140° F.). Resort\r\nto forced and continuous ventilation of the stoke-rooms, with short\r\nhours of duty, renders tolerance of the high temperatures possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNSTROKE.\r\n\r\nThe terms “_sunstroke_,” “_insolation_,” “_coup de soleil_,” are\r\napplied to conditions induced, not alone by exposure to the rays of\r\nthe sun, but rather by a combination of great heat with other exciting\r\ncauses. They are used to designate attacks occurring in very hot\r\nweather after exposure to solar or other sources of extreme heat.\r\nThe striking and usual phenomena are exhaustion, unconsciousness,\r\nstertorous respiration, and death, occurring by syncope, within a\r\nfew moments or hours. In a number of cases the symptoms of cerebral\r\napoplexy with death by coma are present.\r\n\r\nIn others, the condition seems one of complete exhaustion. The majority\r\nof cases seem to be a combination of these several conditions, with\r\ndeath resulting from syncope.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary phenomena of the attack are pain in the head, hurried\r\nrespiration sometimes stertorous, violent beating of the heart with\r\nfailing of its power, oppression within the chest and, occasionally,\r\nnausea and vomiting. The pupils are sometimes dilated and sometimes\r\ncontracted, but in all cases exhibit lessened sensitiveness to light.\r\nThe suddenness of the attack modifies the symptoms developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\nThese are exhaustion with syncopic tendency and a rapid rise in the\r\ntemperature of the body to a point destructive to the activity of the\r\nnervous centres. This is accompanied by an abnormal condition of the\r\nblood, resulting from loss of its watery portions, with retention of\r\neffete products and impaired aeration. A tendency to general stasis,\r\nspecially marked by congestions of the lungs and brain, is present.\r\nThe change in the blood is a very important factor. In some cases, not\r\nfatal at the outset, this induces a septic condition.\r\n\r\nThe greatly elevated temperature of the body undoubtedly produces\r\ncertain modifications which type it, in some respects, as a febrile\r\ndisease; but this, with the septic tendency due to blood changes, is\r\nnot sufficient to designate it as a purely “_thermal fever_,” as some\r\nhave claimed. It is something more than this.\r\n\r\nSunstroke occurs more commonly in tropical than temperate\r\nclimates;[694] and usually in the day-time, at the period of greatest\r\nsolar activity, those attacked being engaged in labor involving\r\nconsiderable exertion. It occasionally, though rarely, occurs at night.\r\nThe military service affords abundant opportunity for observation. Here\r\nthe seizures are on the march, rarely in camp. Fatigue, prolonged and\r\nextreme exertion, ill-adjusted clothing and accoutrements, with the\r\ndeprivation of cool water, are fully as active factors as the heat of\r\nthe sun. The death-rate ranges between forty and fifty per cent, the\r\nmild cases being excluded. Death in some cases is marked by syncope,\r\nin others by apnœa, though the majority seem to die by a combination\r\nof both, as in most cases the pulmonary congestion is more or less\r\npronounced. Undoubtedly the character of the symptoms and mode of death\r\nare influenced, in many cases, by individual tendencies leading to\r\napoplectic conditions or to cardiac or other complications.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThis must be adjusted to the pathological conditions of the patient.\r\nAs already indicated, two classes of cases are met: one marked by\r\nexhaustion, with tendency to death by syncope; the other, a state of\r\nor tendency to cerebral congestion or apoplectic conditions. Exactly\r\nopposite methods of treatment are demanded. In the first, frequency\r\nand feebleness of the heart’s action, with faintness of the heart\r\nsounds and embarrassment of respiration, indicate the tendency to\r\ndeath by nervous exhaustion, and must be met by placing the patient\r\nin a condition of absolute rest and quiet in a cool place. Stimulants\r\nmust be promptly administered, though cautiously on account of the\r\ntendency to nausea and vomiting. Hypodermic injections of alcohol or\r\nether, or rectal enemata of turpentine, alcohol, or other stimulants,\r\nafford means of securing speedy effects when the stomach is irritable.\r\nCarbonate of ammonia and other cardiac stimulants are recommended.\r\nDepleting agents, or such as prove depressing, are to be avoided. In\r\nsome cases, hypodermic injections of small doses of morphine prove\r\nbeneficial. Individual cases must modify therapeutic procedures.\r\n\r\nIn the second class of cases the tendency to cerebral congestion\r\nindicates sedative and depleting procedures. Blood-letting has been\r\nrecommended by some authors, if employed with extreme judgment and\r\ndiscrimination.[695] Cold applied to the head and also to the whole\r\nbody by rubbing with ice[696] or by effusion and the wet sheet, or\r\nother means, is indicated if the temperature is high (104° to 105° F.).\r\nActive catharsis, by promptly acting purgative enemata, is also to be\r\nresorted to in most cases. The convulsions occurring in some cases are\r\nsuccessfully modified and controlled by inhalations of small quantities\r\nof chloroform.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.\r\n\r\nThese, though not clearly characteristic, are pronounced. In some cases\r\nno distinct conditions are found.[697] Local congestions are present in\r\nnearly all cases. Upon the skin are found petechial and livid spots,\r\npallor being occasionally noted. Ecchymoses and subserous hemorrhages\r\nare also common. These conditions have been described as resembling\r\nthose of spotted typhus (Levick).\r\n\r\nRigor mortis is marked and occurs early, putrefaction beginning soon\r\nafter death. The lungs are highly congested and often œdematous, and\r\neffusions of serum are frequently found in the pleural cavities.[698]\r\n\r\nThe heart is usually changed in color and consistence, with the left\r\nventricle contracted and the aorta empty, while the right ventricle\r\nand pulmonary arteries are dilated and engorged. The blood is fluid\r\nand dark.[699] The large vessels of the pia and dura are full of\r\ndark blood. Congestion of the cerebral mass is not always noted. The\r\nventricles contain serum; and extravasations of blood into the cervical\r\nsympathetic ganglia and vagus are sometimes found. The kidneys are\r\nusually moist and œdematous; the liver and spleen congested and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNS AND SCALDS.\r\n\r\nFor all purposes of practice it is unnecessary to draw any distinction\r\nbetween a burn and a scald, for in reality none exists, except as\r\nregards the nature of the causative agent. In some cases requiring\r\ninvestigation, this may prove to be a matter of much importance.\r\n\r\n=Definition.=—A =burn= is an injury produced by the application to the\r\nbody of a heated substance, flame or radiant heat.\r\n\r\nA =scald= is an injury produced by the application of a liquid at or\r\nnear its boiling-point.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEARANCES AS INDICATING ORIGIN.\r\n\r\nA hot body may produce a burn of any intensity, ranging between\r\nreddening of the skin and complete charring of the tissues, according\r\nas its temperature is elevated and the period of contact prolonged: the\r\nshape of the object and its size being indicated by the form of the\r\nburn. Metallic substances heated to a temperature of 100° C. (212° F.)\r\nare capable of producing redness and vesication and other injurious\r\neffects. At this temperature the albuminous elements of the blood and\r\nother fluids undergo coagulation. Some bodies require to be heated to\r\nredness, or nearly so, in order to produce a defined burn.\r\n\r\nVery hot and partially-fused solids cause burns of greater severity\r\nthan where the heated body is of a character favoring prompt removal.\r\nIn such cases their adhesion to the skin involves the tearing away\r\nof the superficial portions of the derma in their removal, or they\r\nby their adherence prolong the contact of the heated body, thus\r\nintensifying their destructive action.\r\n\r\n=Metals in a state of fusion= produce burns which cannot be easily\r\ndistinguished from those caused by solid bodies. Such burns are classed\r\nas scalds. Their effects may vary in any degree between slight redness\r\nand complete destruction of the tissues with charring. Burns caused by\r\nmelted solids are less regular in form and outline than those caused by\r\nheated solids. They are usually of greater severity on account of the\r\nhigh temperature to which they have been raised.[700]\r\n\r\n=Boiling Water.=—Scalds by boiling water may be so slight as to\r\nproduce redness only, or they may be so severe as to cause marked and\r\ncharacteristic symptoms. Those noted in severe cases are an ashy hue\r\nof the skin, accompanied by a soaked or sodden appearance and the\r\nproduction of blisters. Occasionally these features are not easily\r\ndistinguished from those of burns from other sources. Blackening of the\r\nskin and charring of the tissues never result from burns by boiling\r\nwater. As in all burns, a large surface involved renders an early fatal\r\nissue probable. In severe cases, not necessarily fatal, gangrene of the\r\nparts injured sometimes occurs. Most of those met with are accidental,\r\nyet cases of scalding by hot water with intent to injure are not\r\nuncommon, aside from injuries and death resulting from explosion\r\nof boilers, bursting of steam-pipes, etc. Occasional instances are\r\nrecorded of death of children, the insane or feeble persons by\r\ninadvertent immersion in a bath of hot water (Case 21).\r\n\r\nSevere and fatal burns of the mouth, fauces, and larynx in young\r\nchildren occur from _inhaling steam_ or swallowing boiling water from a\r\nteapot or kettle in an attempt to drink (Case 5).\r\n\r\n=Burns by burning oil= produce effects and appearances similar to those\r\nby melted metals.\r\n\r\n=Burns by flame= are specially characterized by scorching of the\r\nsurface. Hairs upon the part actually burned are scorched and usually\r\nalso those in the vicinity of the burned patches. Such conditions\r\ncould not result from scalds by hot water, boiling oil, or from a hot\r\nbody only.\r\n\r\n=Burns by petroleum= or its derivatives resemble the burns from flame,\r\nexcept that the injured portions of the body are not only scorched but\r\nblackened and are usually burned more severely than by flame alone, as\r\nthe clothing holds the burning substance in contact with the parts. The\r\nodor of the agent is also very noticeable.\r\n\r\n=Burns by Acids and Corrosive Agents.=—The injury produced by a\r\nmineral acid, the caustic alkalies, etc., has frequently been the\r\nsource of judicial inquiry. “Vitriol-throwing,” as it has been termed,\r\nhas been and occasionally is resorted to with malicious intent to\r\ninjure. No case of death resulting directly and solely from this cause\r\nis recorded, but grave injuries, involving loss of sight, etc., have\r\nresulted. A case is referred to by Taylor[701] where sulphuric acid\r\nwas poured into the ear of a woman while asleep by her husband. Death\r\nensued, after six weeks, from disease of the brain resulting indirectly\r\nfrom the use of the acid.\r\n\r\nThe appearances of a burn by a mineral acid are distinguished from heat\r\nburns with little difficulty. The eschar which results is not dry and\r\nleathery, as in a burn by heat, but soft and readily sloughing away.\r\nThere is no redness around the site of the injury, the color of the\r\nburn being uniform, and no blisters are formed. There is no blackening\r\nof the skin and the hairs are not scorched. The color of the skin\r\naround the injured portion may afford valuable evidence of the nature\r\nof the agent employed. Nitric acid produces a yellow stain, sulphuric\r\nacid a dark brown, and chlorohydric acid a brownish-yellow stain.[702]\r\nThe clothing also is capable of affording characteristic evidence by\r\nthe discolorations produced; and the destructive agent employed may be\r\ndetermined by a chemical analysis of the fabric.[703]\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to distinguish a post-mortem from an ante-mortem\r\nburn by an acid when no vital reaction has taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSIFICATION OF BURNS.\r\n\r\nA classification of burns according to the severity of the injury\r\ninflicted is the most practical course. Upon this plan, burns may be\r\ndivided into four general classes:\r\n\r\nI. Burns in which the skin or subcutaneous cellular tissues only are\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nII. Burns which involve the muscles, nerves, and blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nIII. Burns involving the internal organs and bones.\r\n\r\nIV. Burns in which the other three classes are variously mixed.\r\n\r\nCLASS I.—The skin in cases such as may occur from a brief contact with\r\na hot body or water near the boiling-point shows a slight redness or\r\nscorching with no enduring mark. Pain is considerable.\r\n\r\nCLASS II.—In the mildest cases the cutis is destroyed in its whole\r\nthickness, and the parts injured are occupied by eschars of a\r\nyellowish-gray or brownish color. The surrounding skin is reddened,\r\nand the formation of blisters occurs either immediately or after an\r\ninterval of a few hours. In these cases a shining cicatrix remains\r\nafter the healing, without contraction of surrounding parts. In the\r\nseverer cases the subcutaneous cellular tissue and underlying muscles\r\nand nerves are destroyed. The blackish eschars formed are insensible\r\nand separate by suppurative process, leaving a granulating surface\r\nbelow. Extensive redness of surrounding tissues, with more or less\r\nvesication, is usually noted. The resulting cicatrices, together with\r\nthe skin and adjoining structures, are prone to contraction, resulting\r\nin considerable deformity, according to location and extent. So great\r\nis the deformity in injuries of the extremities, or even some parts of\r\nthe head and trunk, that extensive surgical operations become necessary\r\nto relieve it.\r\n\r\nCLASS III.—Burns of this class are so severe that an immediately\r\nfatal issue is usually the result. Such instances involve a prolonged\r\nexposure to flame or to a source of intense heat. The appearances\r\ndescribed as belonging to the preceding class are in part found here\r\nwith the addition of charring or carbonizing the parts destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF BURNS.\r\n\r\nThe effects of burns may be considered as I., _Local_, and II.,\r\n_Constitutional_.\r\n\r\n=Local Effects.=—In different instances the effects vary in accordance\r\nwith the extent and severity of the burn. Redness, blisters,\r\ndestruction of the cuticle and of the subcutaneous cellular tissue,\r\nblackening of the skin, scorching of the hair, and roasting of portions\r\nof the body are met with in varying degrees. In some severe cases all\r\nthese are found upon a single body. The redness produced varies in\r\nintensity and extent, according to the nature of the agent producing\r\nthe burn, its form, and the length of time the part was exposed.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the infliction of the burn a special line of redness\r\nappears between the burned parts and the uninjured skin. This _red line\r\nof demarcation_ is formed by intensely injected vessels and becomes a\r\nvery important medico-legal sign in some cases. The vesication may be\r\nsingle or multiple, consisting of one or two large and full blisters\r\nor a number of large and small ones, scattered over the portions\r\nburned, some unbroken and still holding their contents, others broken\r\nand denuded of cuticle or with breaks from which their serum has\r\nescaped upon the surrounding parts. In some cases of burning _cracks\r\nor fissures_ in the skin occur, due to the effect of the heat, making\r\nit dry and brittle and causing it to rupture by the movements of the\r\npatient (Case 8). These fissures are most frequently noted in proximity\r\nto the joints.[704] They resemble wounds, and it occurs occasionally\r\nthat it is important to accurately distinguish their character. In\r\nsome cases the skin only is fissured; in others the subjacent tissues\r\nare also involved. This difference depends upon the depth of the burn.\r\nIn the first condition the skin splits, leaving the subcutaneous fat\r\nexposed, which in some instances is partially melted by the heat and\r\nflows out over the edge of the crack upon the surrounding skin (Cases\r\n8, 13). The blood-vessels in such cases usually are not burned and,\r\nowing to their elasticity, remain stretching across the fissure (Case\r\n14). The smaller may be seen by careful examination with a lens:\r\nthey should always be looked for. In the second class of injuries\r\nthe vessels are involved in the burn and break with the cracking of\r\nthe skin. The importance of careful observation of these fissures is\r\nemphasized in cases of apparent wounds associated with burning. It may\r\nbe necessary to decide whether the wounds are the result of the action\r\nof heat as above described or were caused by some sharp instrument or\r\nweapon. Careful inspection of the edges of the wounds will show whether\r\nthey are ragged, as the result of fissure, or clean-cut by some sharp\r\ninstrument. The absence of evidences indicating hemorrhage upon the\r\nsurrounding parts and the detection of uncut blood-vessels extending\r\nacross the fissure will establish the differential diagnosis. Wounds of\r\nthe above character resulting from the action of fire may exist on the\r\nsame body with wounds of actual violence. It is important, therefore,\r\nin all cases to examine each wound with special care and record its\r\nposition, shape, depth, and other characteristics.\r\n\r\n=Constitutional Effects.=—As in all sudden and violent injuries, the\r\neffect of a severe burn upon the nervous system is very marked. This\r\nis manifest in the symptoms of “shock,” with pallor and coldness of\r\nthe surface of the body, a feeble pulse, chills or shivering, and a\r\ntendency to collapse. In other cases, proving immediately fatal, these\r\nsymptoms are followed by obstructed respiration with death from coma\r\nsucceeding. In other cases convulsions precede death, while in such as\r\nare not immediately fatal a reaction more or less imperfect ensues upon\r\nthe first constitutional symptoms.\r\n\r\nDeath from cerebral congestion or effusion may result before any\r\ndefinite evidence of reaction appears. In some instances pulmonary\r\ncongestion or œdema occurs, with or without pleural effusion,\r\nterminating in death before reaction. This period usually covers\r\nthe first two days. In some cases immediate death results from\r\nthe depression produced by the severity of the pain. During the\r\nsubsequent two weeks a period of inflammatory reaction succeeds, when\r\ninflammations of the thoracic and abdominal viscera, with ulcerative\r\nprocesses in some organs, are developed and induce a fatal termination\r\n(Cases 10, 11, 16).\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF DEATH.\r\n\r\nThe causes of death are due to several conditions. This fact\r\nis explained in part by the relation which exists between the\r\ncerebro-spinal and sympathetic nervous systems, and of the nervous\r\nsupply of the surface to that of the internal organs, which in cases\r\nof extensive injury proportionately modify the conditions of the\r\nvisceral organs. As death in burning results from various causes, it is\r\nconvenient to consider them under two classes:\r\n\r\n1st. Those _immediately_ fatal.\r\n\r\n2d. Those fatal _after an interval_.\r\n\r\nThe FIRST DIVISION would include cases in which the deprivation of\r\nfresh air and the presence of asphyxiating products of combustion\r\n(carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide) were the immediate causes of death\r\nby _suffocation_ or _asphyxia_ (Cases 9, 18).\r\n\r\n_Accidents_ in endeavoring to escape or _injuries_ by falling walls\r\nor timbers may cause death immediately, and burning the body occur\r\nsubsequently.\r\n\r\nImmediate death may result from _syncope_ or _collapse_ from the\r\nviolence of the shock to the nervous system by the pain resulting from\r\nthe burns.\r\n\r\nThe SECOND DIVISION includes those conditions where death may result\r\nearly, from a series of causes less immediate than those just mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Cerebral congestion_ and _effusion_, resulting in death from coma,\r\nis not unusual (Case 15). In this connection Taylor[705] cites a case\r\nof alleged poisoning by opium, in the treatment of a burn, in a child\r\ndying comatose, and emphasizes the undesirability of administering\r\nopium or its preparations to children in cases of burns of any\r\nseverity. The danger claimed to exist is hardly to be considered.\r\nIn the case referred to, Abernethy, who was a witness in the case,\r\nascribed death to coma induced by the effect of the burn. The\r\npowerfully depressing influence of the pain in sensitive organizations\r\nand liability to death from shock therefrom must be remembered.\r\n\r\n_Inflammatory conditions_ of the _respiratory tract_ or organs are\r\ncommon results; _pneumonia_, _bronchitis_, and sudden congestion or\r\nœdema of the lungs are frequent (Cases 11, 15, 16).\r\n\r\n_Inflammation of the intestines_, inducing _peritonitis_ and\r\n_ulcerations_ of the intestines with or without resulting hemorrhage,\r\noccurs as a frequent lesion (Case 10).\r\n\r\n_Gangrene_ or _septicæmia_ causes death in other instances.\r\n\r\n_Exhaustion_, from extensive and prolonged suppuration or from severe\r\nand long-continued pain and other conditions, terminates other cases\r\n(Case 12).\r\n\r\nLegally, burns and scalds are included among injuries endangering life,\r\nbut are not described as wounds. They may be considered dangerous\r\naccording to the extent of surface which they cover, rather than the\r\ndepth to which they involve the tissues.\r\n\r\nThe extensive injury to the sensory nerve structures and the\r\nsuspension of function or destruction of a considerable portion of the\r\nperspiratory tracts render large superficial burns far more fatal than\r\nthose confined to a small part of a limb, for example, which may be\r\ndeeply burned. From a medico-legal point it is desirable to establish\r\nthe fact of how large a surface must be injured to prove fatal. The\r\neffort to reduce the subject to a statement of an exact minimum area of\r\nsquare inches seems very objectionable and liable to lead to erroneous\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to make a general statement, subject to some\r\nqualifications, which may serve as a basis of conclusion, as each\r\nindividual case must be considered in its own circumstances.\r\n\r\nA burn involving two-thirds of the body may be regarded as necessarily\r\nfatal; but the injury of a much less proportion, even one-fourth of\r\nthe surface, has resulted in death. The qualifications to be made\r\nin burns of less extent are pronounced. The _part affected_ is of\r\nmuch importance. Burns of the trunk are more fatal than those of the\r\nextremities; and those of the genital organs[706] and lower part of the\r\nabdomen are especially so (Case 7).\r\n\r\nThe character of the burn, whether single and continuous or multiple\r\nand scattered over various portions of the body, is a very important\r\nmodifying circumstance, involving the questions of excessive pain and\r\nthe difficulty in insuring necessary treatment for all parts injured.\r\n\r\nThe physical condition of the patient and sensitiveness of the nervous\r\nsystem to pain exert a powerfully determining influence. Burns in\r\nchildren and sensitive, nervous females are specially serious and call\r\nfor an unfavorable prognosis.\r\n\r\n=Spontaneous Combustion.=—Spontaneous combustion of the human body\r\nhas been seriously discussed in this connection, and explanations of\r\npopularly reported cases have been attempted. The writer refers to\r\nthe subject here for the sole purpose of stating that no trustworthy\r\nevidence of the possibility of any such condition or result exists.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nIn cases of severe burns the constitutional as well as the local\r\nconditions demand attention. Locally, a great variety of applications\r\nhas been employed: starch, gum, oxide of zinc, solution of caoutchou,\r\ncollodion, cotton wadding, a mixture of linseed oil and lime-water\r\non cotton or lint, and many other agents are used. The important\r\nconsideration is to exclude the air from and to afford a protective\r\ncovering for the injured surface. The constitutional treatment varies\r\nin different cases; but its main object is to relieve pain, induce\r\nreaction from the shock, and support the depressed nervous system.\r\n\r\nFor the first opium or its preparations in proper doses is indicated.\r\nAlcoholic stimulants in some cases are demanded in addition. After\r\nthe stage of reaction has occurred the therapeutics must be governed\r\nby inflammatory conditions; or later by the exhaustion from continued\r\npain, suppuration, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.\r\n\r\nIn the EXTERNAL post-mortem examination of a burned body careful\r\nnote should be made of the sex, probable age, and every circumstance\r\nleading to the establishment of the identity of the individual. The\r\nparts burned should be specially examined as to their condition,\r\nwhether exhibiting redness, vesication, or charring. The amount of\r\nsurface covered by the burns should be computed; also the relation of\r\nthe burned parts to those uninjured, whether separated by a sharply\r\nmarked line of redness or merging into the sound skin without a line\r\nof demarcation. The condition of the blisters should be examined as\r\nto whether they are full or empty and their contents as to whether\r\nconsisting of clear or turbid serum.\r\n\r\nINTERNALLY.—In some cases no lesions are found on examination. These\r\nare usually cases where death occurred from shock or severe pain (Case\r\n12). Ordinarily the mucous membrane of the respiratory tracts is\r\ncongested. In some instances, however, no redness has been discernible.\r\nWhere death occurred by suffocation and asphyxia, the trachea and\r\nbronchial tubes have been found to contain a dark smoky or sooty\r\nmucus[707] (Case 9).\r\n\r\nThe serous membranes of the brain, thorax, and abdomen are in many\r\ncases found reddened with effusions, more or less considerable,\r\ninto the ventricles of the brain and the pleural, pericardial, and\r\nperitoneal cavities from the sudden inflow of blood from the surface,\r\ncaused by the local injuries.\r\n\r\nWhen the body has been badly charred or incinerated the skeleton\r\nusually remains, and it is possible to determine the age from the size\r\nand development of the bones and the sex from the shape of the bones\r\nof the pelvis. Careful search should be made for special articles of\r\nidentity. False teeth,[708] a watch and chain, buttons, etc., have\r\nalone been sufficient to identify the incinerated remains (Case 23).\r\nWhere the whole body and even the bones have been reduced to ashes,\r\nsome portions of bone, etc., may be found on careful search. Sifting\r\nthe ashes will give some pieces of bone, etc., which may be sufficient\r\nto disclose the presence of human remains[709] (Case 24). A chemical\r\nanalysis of the ashes also will aid in establishing this fact. In cases\r\nwhere cremation of the body has been resorted to to conceal crime, the\r\nlength of time necessary to entirely consume the human body may become\r\nan important question. A period of less than ten hours has been proven\r\nsufficient.[710]\r\n\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF THE OCCURRENCE OF DEATH.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, death may occur from direct causes during the\r\nfirst forty-eight hours after the infliction of the burn, or may take\r\nplace during a period extending from the second day to the fifth or\r\neven the sixth week. In the great majority of cases the fatal result\r\noccurs during the first five or six days. In some instances it may be\r\nimportant to establish the fact as to _how long after the infliction of\r\nthe burn the person may have survived_.\r\n\r\nInflammation and suppuration would not ordinarily begin until about\r\nthe third day, hence the existence of this condition would indicate\r\nthat the person had probably lived two days or more; and the state of\r\nadvancement of these processes would afford some further evidence. The\r\nexistence of intestinal inflammations and ulcerations, which require\r\nsome days for their appearance and development, would also give some\r\nindication of the probable time elapsing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS THE BURN ANTE MORTEM OR POST MORTEM?\r\n\r\nIn describing the anatomical characters of a burn occurring during\r\nlife, =vesication=, the formation of blisters, is regarded as a marked\r\nsymptom.\r\n\r\nWhile it is not an invariable result in a burn of the living body,\r\nit is so constant as to become one of the most important factors in\r\nanswering the question as to the ante-or post-mortem infliction of\r\nthe burn. Where the burn has been caused by a scalding fluid, or by\r\nburning of the clothing, or the direct application of flame, blisters\r\nare more likely to occur than where contact with a highly heated body\r\nhas taken place. In the formation of a blister the cuticle is raised\r\nfrom the derma or true skin by the effusion of a highly albuminous\r\nserum, and the surrounding skin is of a bright or coppery red color.\r\nThe time of the appearance of such a blister is not fixed. It may occur\r\nalmost immediately or may not do so for several hours, an interval\r\nsufficiently long for death to occur from shock. It must be remembered\r\nthat a burn inflicted in a condition of great depression of the vital\r\npowers with insensibility may be followed by no vesication or redness,\r\nbut upon reaction and return of sensation both redness and blisters\r\nmay appear (Case 17). In the absence of blisters, therefore, it cannot\r\nbe decided that for this reason the burn was post mortem. If from a\r\nblister formed on the living body the cuticle be carefully removed,\r\nthe site of the blister will present an intensely reddened base. In\r\nthe dead body, if the cuticle be removed, no red base appears, but the\r\nsurface of the blister becomes dry and of a grayish color.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the presence of blisters is noted, can it be\r\nconcluded that the burn was ante mortem? While their presence affords\r\nreason for an affirmative answer, careful examination of the blisters\r\nas to their character and contents must be made in order to decide; the\r\npresence of apparent blisters is not alone sufficient (Cases 20, 18;\r\nPlate II.).\r\n\r\nElaborate experiments have been made in order to decide the possibility\r\nof producing blisters post mortem.\r\n\r\nLeuret,[711] in experiments upon dropsical subjects twenty-four hours\r\nafter death, shows the possibility of raising a blister post-mortem,\r\nbut one which can be distinguished from one of ante-mortem production,\r\nin that it contains a reddish serum very slightly albuminous. He urges\r\nextreme care in deciding this question.\r\n\r\nChristison[712] found it impossible to produce a blister a few hours\r\nafter death. In a patient unconscious from narcotic poison, heat\r\napplied four hours before death produced a blister and a red line was\r\nformed around the burns. In the burns produced half an hour after\r\ndeath, in the same patient, blisters formed in two places only, and\r\nthese were covered by dry skin and contained air. No redness appeared\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nChampouillon[713] agrees with Leuret in his conclusions, from\r\nexperiments upon dropsical subjects.\r\n\r\nKosack[714] considers blisters with albuminous contents diagnostic of\r\nburns during life, but states the necessity for care in deciding in the\r\nabsence of other signs of reaction.\r\n\r\nWright[715] was able to produce blisters three and a half hours\r\nafter death containing a small quantity of pale serum. On the same\r\nbody, similar experiments fifteen hours after death produced blisters\r\ncontaining no serum.\r\n\r\nCaspar[716] states, as a result of experiments, that blisters may be\r\nproduced by flame after death; that they result from vaporization of\r\nthe fluid beneath the cuticle by the heat employed; that they are not\r\nfound to contain serum and no line of redness is found at their base.\r\nThe presence after death of vesications containing serum and surrounded\r\nby a reddish base is an evidence that the burn was inflicted ante\r\nmortem. He distinctly says: “It is quite impossible to confound a burn\r\ninflicted during life with one inflicted after death.”\r\n\r\nWoodman and Tidy,[717] in an extended series of experiments, conclude\r\nthat while blisters can be produced post mortem, they are readily\r\ndistinguished from those formed ante mortem in containing no serum; and\r\neven in dropsical subjects, where blisters containing some fluid were\r\nformed, the presence of but a mere trace of albumin was shown; and, in\r\nall, no redness about the base of the blisters was produced, nor any\r\nappearance of redness after removal of the cuticle.\r\n\r\nTaylor[718] has never observed vesications in post-mortem experiments\r\non infants. He cites a case of drowning where the person, “pulseless\r\nand apparently dead,” was imprudently placed in a _hot_ bath. Blisters\r\ncontaining bloody serum were formed over several portions of the body.\r\nHe concludes that hot water on the living and recently dead body, so\r\nfar as vesication is concerned, produces similar effects.\r\n\r\nIn experiments on the dead body immediately after death the writer has\r\nfailed to produce any blister containing serum or fluid. The so-called\r\nblisters are produced by the rapid expansion and evaporation of the\r\nfluid beneath the cuticle over the portion to which the heat was\r\napplied, and differ distinctly from blisters caused during life, in the\r\nabsence of serum or any redness of adjacent or subjacent parts (Plate\r\nII.).\r\n\r\nChambert[719] concludes that in living bodies and in dead bodies within\r\ntwenty-four hours after death blisters can be produced, and that less\r\nheat will develop them in the living. He specially emphasizes the\r\ndifference, in the albuminous character of the contents, of a blister\r\nformed ante mortem and of one formed post mortem.\r\n\r\nJastrowitz[720] emphasizes the difference between blisters formed\r\nduring life and those occurring in œdematous conditions.\r\n\r\nBlisters are to be distinguished from the bullæ arising from\r\nputrefaction. There is little danger of confounding such cases. In\r\nconditions of putrefaction no redness or line of demarcation exists,\r\nand the green discoloration and other conditions of the skin will\r\nsuffice to establish the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nSchjerning[721] considers blisters containing highly albuminous serum\r\nas diagnostic of burns produced during life. In some conditions of\r\ndepression of nutrition blisters occasionally form, but are not liable\r\nto be confounded with those caused by burning.\r\n\r\nA second anatomical feature of much importance, even more so than\r\nvesication, is the condition of the skin to which the heat was applied.\r\nIt assumes a dusky red color and a dry and parchment-like condition\r\n(Case 8). Surrounding this is an area of grayish-white skin bounded by\r\na sharply defined and deeply injected =red line=, which in turn shades\r\ninto the color of the surrounding skin. These features are more or less\r\npronounced according to the degree of heat applied and to the length of\r\ntime of contact; or, in other words, to the depth and severity of the\r\nburn (Plate I.).\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS OF DISTINGUISHING ANTE-MORTEM FROM POST-MORTEM BURNS.\r\n\r\nDifferentially, a distinction is to be made between the surrounding\r\n_redness_ and _the line of redness_. The redness due to capillary\r\ndistention is transient, disappears under pressure during life,\r\nand fades after death. The line of redness is permanent, changing\r\nbut little under pressure, and remains after death. It is a vital\r\nreactionary effort, a true line of separation between living and\r\ndead tissue, formed in the same manner as the line of demarcation in\r\nsphacelus or gangrene. This line of redness, developed only during life\r\nand permanent after death, is of great significance in cases with\r\na medico-legal bearing. It has been already stated that in persons\r\nin a condition of depressed vitality the appearance of redness and\r\nvesication is sometimes very tardy and imperfect, and that death from\r\nshock or pain may occur before their development at all. They are vital\r\nprocesses and require time for their appearance in proportion to the\r\nactivity of the powers of reaction. Hence in cases of burning resulting\r\nfatally where vesication and redness do not appear, the circumstances\r\nmust be carefully considered before deciding that the burns produced\r\nwere post mortem. With these qualifications, it may be stated that the\r\npresence of the red line is almost uniform in burns inflicted during\r\nlife and absent in those occurring after death.\r\n\r\nIf upon a body bearing evidences of exposure to heat there be found\r\nblisters containing highly albuminous serum, and such blisters, after\r\nthe removal of the cuticle, present a bright red base surrounded by\r\na bright and sharp line of demarcation, with redness of adjacent\r\nsurface, we are justified in concluding that the burns were inflicted\r\nante mortem or, at farthest, within a few moments of death. If, on the\r\ncontrary, the red line is absent and the blisters contain a thin watery\r\nfluid, with a yellowish and dry condition of their base after removal\r\nof the cuticle, the presumption is that the burning occurred post\r\nmortem.\r\n\r\nWhere _a number of burns_ are found upon a body, the question whether\r\nthey were produced simultaneously may be raised. This can be answered\r\nby examination as to their condition. If some show signs of recent\r\ninfliction, while others are in conditions of suppuration or other\r\nchanges which only occur after an interval, a difference of time in\r\nproduction would be probable. But if all present mainly the same\r\nconditions, the probability of their occurring at the same time may be\r\nconcluded (Plates I. and II.).\r\n\r\n=The Condition of the Blood.=—Special examination of the blood of\r\npersons dying from the effect of burns has been made by competent\r\nobservers. While it is not at present possible to define an exact and\r\nconstant condition, specially characteristic, some features of interest\r\nhave been recently recorded.\r\n\r\nThe color of the blood has been variously reported; in some cases as\r\nbeing of a dark color and in others of a bright arterial hue. Death\r\nby asphyxia or suffocation, by the deprivation of oxygen, and by the\r\nproducts of combustion, would be accompanied by a dark or venous hue\r\nof the blood. An atmosphere containing an excess of carbon monoxide,\r\nresulting from combustion, would cause death by apnœa with an arterial\r\nhue to the blood.[722] But other influences must be considered.\r\nAccording to Schjerning,[723] it is difficult to deduce positive\r\nconclusions from the condition of the blood. The changes induced by the\r\nspleen and kidneys, as well as the varying intensity of the degree of\r\nheat to which the body may be subjected, tend to render positive and\r\nconstant conclusions from this source difficult.\r\n\r\nFalk[724] refers to the bright red color of the blood found in some\r\ncases, and explains this condition in part by the influence of chemical\r\nchanges in the tissues surrounding the vessels.\r\n\r\nWertheim[725] describes certain conditions observed by him and mentions\r\nan increase in the number of the leucocytes, together with the presence\r\nof hæmoglobin and melanin.\r\n\r\nHoppe Seyler meets with similar results and arrives at the same\r\nconclusions in his observations.\r\n\r\nPonfik,[726] on the contrary, is doubtful of the constant presence of\r\nsome of these conditions and also of their diagnostic value.\r\n\r\nSeliger[727] confirms the conclusions of Wertheim, in that he describes\r\nthe presence of crystalline bodies and of dark discolorations (melanin).\r\n\r\nSome spectroscopic analyses have disclosed the presence of bands\r\nadditional to those of normal blood. The lack of uniformity of\r\nconditions described and of conclusions reached leaves the subject in a\r\nposition of uncertainty. Examination of the blood of those dying from\r\nburns has not been so extensively and minutely followed as to enable us\r\nto decide questions which may arise in any case.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF PLATE II.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.—ANTE-MORTEM BURN.\r\n\r\nScald by steam from a boiler bursting, July, 1892.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken sixty hours after the accident. The injury\r\ncovered one-half of the surface of the body. The red line is sharply\r\nmarked; the extensive blisters formed are broken and their contents\r\nhave escaped; the serum drying has produced yellowish discolorations;\r\nthe blush of redness on adjacent parts is well marked. Death resulted\r\non the fifth day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGURE 2.—POST-MORTEM BURN.\r\n\r\n_Exp. 1._ (Appearances after application of a _tin can containing\r\nboiling water_.) The cuticle was raised by expansion. The blisters\r\ncontained no serum and no red line is developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGURE 3.—POST-MORTEM BURN.\r\n\r\n_Exp. 2._ (Appearances after the application of _iron at a dull red\r\nheat_.) No proper blister formed; the cuticle was raised, as in\r\nprevious experiment. There was no serum and no red line or redness of\r\nadjacent parts. The cuticle is charred at one point, where the iron was\r\nbrought into contact with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE—PLATE II.\r\n\r\nBURN, TWO HOURS AFTER DEATH, BY IRON AT A DULL RED HEAT.\r\n\r\nBURN, TWO HOURS AFTER DEATH, BY TIN CAN CONTAINING BOILING WATER.\r\n\r\nBURN BY STEAM, SIXTY HOURS AFTER INJURY.\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM AND ANTE-MORTEM BURNS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS DEATH ACCIDENTAL, SUICIDAL, OR HOMICIDAL?\r\n\r\nNearly all deaths occurring from burning are accidental, very few\r\nhomicidal, and hardly more than a few exceptional cases suicidal.\r\n\r\nIt is important in cases of legal investigation to note the position of\r\nthe body when found and its relation to the apparent source of fire;\r\nthe parts of the body and clothing burned, etc.; evidences of violence\r\nshould be carefully observed, such as contusions, fractures of bones,\r\nwounds of the soft parts, evidences of strangling, etc. (Case 22).\r\nThese should be specially sought in the site of the burned portions,\r\nas burning and cremation of the victim are sometimes a resort to\r\nconceal homicide. In considering the character of the apparent wounds,\r\nit must be remembered that extensive injuries, resembling wounds, may\r\nresult from the effects of fire,[728] and these must be carefully\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nInability to detect special marks of violence need not preclude the\r\npossibility of its commission and of its being a possible cause of\r\ndeath (Case 19). The parts burned, the character and depth of the\r\nburns, and their relation to the apparent source of burning, with\r\nconsideration of their probable simultaneous exposure, are all\r\ncircumstances of weight in forming an opinion. The position of the\r\nbody in relation to the fire should also be considered. In accidental\r\nburning, except in cases of intoxication, epileptic seizures, or other\r\nsources of helplessness, the victim is quite likely to be found at a\r\ndistance from the fire, owing to his efforts to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASES.\r\n\r\n CASE 1. _Death from Cold._ _Accidental_ (Dr. Hilty in Caspar’s\r\n _Vierteljahrschrift_, II., 1865, p. 140).—Male, æt. 52; intoxicated.\r\n Severe winter weather; death from exposure.

Liebig and\r\n Bischoff, of Giessen, March, 1850).—The man Stauff was tried at\r\n Darmstadt for the murder of the Countess of Goerlitz, whom he had\r\n attacked and murdered in her chamber, and then fired the furniture in\r\n order to conceal the crime. It was uncertain whether she had died from\r\n injury to the head or from strangulation. The tongue protruded and was\r\n swollen, as in cases of strangling, and maintained this condition. He\r\n was convicted chiefly on circumstantial evidence. After conviction\r\n he confessed that he had strangled her and then set fire to the\r\n furniture, which he had piled up about her.\r\n\r\n CASE 23. _Murder. Body Burned._ _Identified_ (“Report of the Trial\r\n of Prof. Webster,” etc., Boston, 1850).—Prof. Webster killed Dr.\r\n Parkman and then burned the body, in portions, in a furnace in his\r\n laboratory. Search among the cinders of the furnace disclosed pieces\r\n of human bones and a set of false teeth which the dentist who made\r\n them recognized as made by him for Dr. Parkman, etc.\r\n\r\n CASE 24. _Murder.

The body was burned in a wood stove, with pine shingles. The\r\n ashes were thrown into a swamp near by. They were found and carefully\r\n sifted. Pieces of bone of various sizes, identified as human, were\r\n found, as also a few porcelain buttons, etc. A few hairs found, with\r\n stains, completed the identity. Experiments in this case showed that\r\n the body could have been consumed within _ten_ hours. The prisoner was\r\n convicted of murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE MEDICO-LEGAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\n  OF\r\n\r\n  ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM N. BULLARD, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICO-LEGAL RELATIONS OF ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS the frequency of accidents caused by electricity is rapidly\r\nincreasing, we have of late years been enabled to generalize in\r\na manner never before possible in regard to their results, and\r\nalthough our present conclusions must be recognized as provisional\r\nand perhaps temporary—to be changed or modified in accordance with\r\nfuture knowledge—yet we have obtained a basis of fact on which we\r\ncan securely rely. The general laws of injury and accident through\r\nelectricity have been fairly well determined, although many of the\r\ndetails are not yet thoroughly worked out or understood. The advances\r\nof knowledge in this direction are so rapid that an article on this\r\nsubject, if it deals too closely with details, is liable to become out\r\nof date almost before it has left the press. Like all large subjects\r\nwhen first made objects of general interest and investigation, and in\r\nregard to which we are on the threshold only of knowledge, the facts\r\ndiscoverable may lead us at any time in unexpected directions and open\r\nout new fields of thought and inquiry. We shall try to limit ourselves\r\nhere, as far as possible, to proved facts, and leave questions doubtful\r\nor in dispute to be settled later; contenting ourselves merely with\r\npointing them out and, perhaps, in some cases giving the facts on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\nElectrical accidents and injuries may be divided into those which\r\nare caused by the atmospheric electricity—lightning proper, globes\r\nof fire, St. Elmo’s fire—and those produced through the agency of\r\nmechanical or artificial electricity—electrical machines, batteries,\r\ndynamos, etc. The effects caused by these different agents probably\r\nvary only in degree: the atmospheric electricity in the form of\r\nlightning, etc., being so much more powerful than the charges usually\r\nproduced artificially as to cause some difference in the results.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES FROM ELECTRICAL MACHINES AND\r\nCONDUCTORS.\r\n\r\n=Medical Electricity.=—In the ordinary use of the mild forms of\r\nelectricity employed for medical purposes, certain phenomena may at\r\ntimes occur, which, although not of any serious import or of long\r\nduration, may yet cause considerable inconvenience, pain, or discomfort\r\nto the patient or others, and may even be of some importance from a\r\nmedico-legal point of view. We shall not enter here into the discussion\r\nof the proper methods of application of medical electricity, nor do\r\nmore than point out that if these be not followed with care the patient\r\nmay be not only not benefited, but made worse, and may even suffer\r\nconsiderable injury. The increase of pain caused by the improper\r\napplication of certain currents is usually temporary and of minor\r\nconsequence. But serious and lasting inflammations may be caused by\r\nthe careless, ignorant, or injudicious use of the stronger currents\r\ninternally, and metritis and peri-uterine inflammations have been not\r\ninfrequently reported from the unskilled practice of the methods of\r\nApostoli. These subjects, however, scarcely come under the scope of\r\nthis article.\r\n\r\nIn addition, however, to these troubles we may have _external_ injuries\r\nproduced. Even in cases where the current amounts to not more than a\r\nfew milliamperes burns may be caused by the ordinary electrodes of the\r\ngalvanic battery. The faradic current when medically used does not, as\r\na rule, produce any external injuries. Such might be caused by a spark\r\nfrom a static machine, but it would be due to gross carelessness, and\r\nis very unusual. Burns, however, from the use of the galvanic current\r\nare not very uncommon. They usually occur under the electrode after it\r\nhas been for a few moments stationary in contact with the skin. They\r\noccur in certain patients with extraordinary readiness, especially in\r\nthose with organic spinal lesions, and where the sensation is somewhat\r\ndiminished, and where also some trophic lesion might be supposed to\r\nexist. They are not confined, however, to this class of cases, but\r\nmay occur in any one if the electrode be retained too long in any one\r\nplace, and especially if it be allowed to become dry. These burns are\r\npeculiar in appearance and can usually be recognized at once. They are\r\ncircular, as if punched out, about the size of a common pencil or a\r\nlittle smaller, comparatively deep, gray with perhaps a dark ring at\r\nthe circumference, and frequently surrounded by a reddened area. The\r\nedges are sharp. Their peculiarity consists (1) in their painlessness\r\nand (2) in their size, regular form, their depth in comparison to their\r\nextent, and the sharp limitation of the area of tissue destroyed.\r\nOne or more may occur under a broad electrode, and they are probably\r\nproduced at those points where the contact is imperfect or the\r\nconduction in some other way impeded. They heal without much difficulty\r\nand leave no serious results.\r\n\r\nOther unpleasant symptoms produced by currents in medical use may be\r\nmentioned for the sake of completeness, and also as an introduction\r\nto the more serious symptoms caused by stronger currents. Dizziness,\r\nvertigo, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, and syncope are readily caused\r\nby even slight currents. The sensation of light in the eyes and the\r\nmetallic taste in the mouth are the results of medical currents of\r\nordinary strength when applied to the head or in its neighborhood, and\r\nstronger currents applied at greater distances cause these sensations.\r\nAll the above symptoms may be readily caused by even slight currents,\r\nwhether galvanic or faradic, passed through the head. The syncope thus\r\nproduced is to be carefully differentiated from the syncope caused\r\npsychically by excitement or fear of the application of electricity.\r\nHysterical women, and even persons who show no special signs of\r\nnervous instability, may faint at the suggestion of the application\r\nof electricity. I have seen a large, strong, well-built Italian man,\r\nperfectly sound physically, so far as could be detected, except some\r\nslight local neuralgia, faint from pure fright when the electricity was\r\nto be applied. But even the application of moderately severe shocks\r\nfrom the ordinary medical battery are not likely to produce serious\r\nresults. These shocks are ordinarily caused by the opening or closing\r\nof the galvanic current, and are most severe when the current passes\r\nthrough some portion of the head. A still more powerful shock may be\r\ngiven by reversing the current in a galvanic battery by means of the\r\ncommutator.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRENTS OF HIGH TENSION—STRONG ARTIFICIAL CURRENTS.\r\n\r\nPassing on now to the consideration of the stronger currents, we\r\ncome to those used for mechanical purposes, for electric lighting,\r\nelectric railways, and other analogous objects. These currents start\r\nfrom dynamos or from storage batteries, and accidents are caused by\r\nthem whenever they are diverted from their proper course and are\r\ncaused to come in contact with or to pass through any portion of the\r\nhuman body in any considerable strength. Accidents not infrequently\r\noccur from direct contact with the batteries or dynamos, but still\r\nmore frequently they are produced in their circuit along the wires or\r\ntransmitters. They may also be caused, as some of the most fatal have\r\nbeen, by contact with metallic or other readily conducting objects\r\nwhich have themselves accidentally come in contact with some portion\r\nof an electric circuit (usually wires) and have diverted the whole, or\r\nmore usually a portion, of the current to themselves. Thus was killed\r\na young man in New York, the clerk in a store, who while lifting the\r\nmetal-edged cover of a show-case brought it in contact with the charged\r\nwires of an electric light and received an immediately fatal shock. As\r\na rule, those meeting with accidents from dynamos or electric machines\r\ndirectly are employees of electric companies, who are presumed to\r\nhave more or less knowledge of the risk of carelessness, or they may\r\nbe workers in institutions or factories in which such machines are in\r\nuse. Many of the accidents due to wires also occur to linemen and other\r\nemployees of electric, telephone, or telegraph companies or of electric\r\nrailway companies in charge of wires or electric outfit. So long as the\r\ncurrent transmitters and terminals (wires, etc.) are properly insulated\r\nand in their proper position in relation to other conductors, it is\r\nunusual for accidents to occur, except in cases of gross ignorance or\r\ncarelessness. Unfortunately, however, proper insulation is not always\r\naccomplished, and frequently wires and other transmitters are removed\r\nfrom their proper positions by accidents and otherwise. So long as and\r\nwherever the system of overhead wires exists, if there be among these\r\nwires any which are the transmitters of strong electric currents,\r\nthere is always a risk, and often a very serious one, that at some time\r\nor other one of these current-bearing wires will come into contact\r\nwith some other non-current-bearing and ordinarily harmless wire in\r\nsuch a manner that the current of the first should be diverted, in\r\nwhole or in part, on to the ordinarily innocuous wire, which thereby\r\nbecomes at once charged and dangerous. Such an accident may be due to\r\nthe displacement of either wire or to any other cause which brings\r\nthe two in contact, either direct or indirect, at a point where the\r\ncurrent-bearing wire is not sufficiently insulated. The current having\r\nonce passed out of its proper circuit will, of course, follow the\r\npaths of best conduction, and may hence suddenly appear in unexpected\r\nquarters and produce the most dangerous and even fatal effects. It\r\nis accidents of this character which most frequently occur among the\r\npeople who are neither employees of electric companies nor engaged in\r\nfactories or buildings where electrical machines are employed.\r\n\r\n=Insulation of Wires and Other Electrical Transmitters.=—We cannot\r\nmention here the various methods employed to insulate wires, as the\r\ngeneral principles of insulation are well known. Electric wires even\r\nwith very strong currents can be insulated and can be kept insulated\r\nif sufficient pains be taken and sufficient money be expended. But\r\nthis is very expensive and in many cases is not done. Only partial\r\ninsulation is attempted, and even this is not always carried to\r\nthe degree intended or stipulated. Hence so long as overhead wires\r\nof various kinds exist, accidents from the transmission of strong\r\nelectric currents along ordinarily harmless wires are liable at any\r\ntime to occur, as practically little or no attempt at keeping the\r\ncurrent-bearing wires covered with a thoroughly insulating material\r\nis in most cases made. It is usually deemed sufficient that glass or\r\nother insulators should be so placed that under ordinary conditions the\r\nwire will not come into contact with any conductor which may cause any\r\nessential part of its current to diverge. In most cases a so-called\r\ninsulating material is placed over the wire itself, but this usually is\r\ninsufficient at the outset or becomes so before very long and is then\r\nnot renewed.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that underground electric wires\r\nor transmitters cannot produce accidents. On the contrary, the\r\ncurrent may be diverted from them to the gas or water pipes or to any\r\nother conductors which come into contact with them or can attract\r\nto themselves a portion of their current. Severe shocks have been\r\nexperienced by persons attempting to draw water at their faucet from\r\ncauses of this character. At the same time, so far as mere safety is\r\nconcerned and freedom from electrical accidents, it would seem that\r\nunderground wires are preferable to overhead wires.\r\n\r\nElectrical wires have not infrequently come in contact with telegraph\r\nand telephone wires causing unpleasant results. Telephone boxes have\r\nbeen set on fire, and also telegraph boards and tables, and in certain\r\ncases what might have been serious conflagrations have been started\r\nin this manner. By means of proper arrangements on the telegraph and\r\ntelephone circuits these dangers can be at least partially avoided,\r\nbut there is always the risk that the automatic alarms and other\r\ncontrivances do not act, and the still greater one that persons or\r\nthings may come into contact with these charged wires and receive\r\ndangerous or serious injuries.\r\n\r\n=Electric Cars.=—The danger from the overhead wires in the trolley\r\nsystem of electric cars would not be great were these wires properly\r\nsupported, properly insulated, and properly protected. Each of these\r\nterms must be explained. Wires which fall for any cause whatever short\r\nof being intentionally removed cannot be deemed properly supported in\r\nthe sense in which we use the term. Any one of these electric wires\r\nwhich falls is liable to produce serious injury to persons or animals\r\n(many horses have been killed by them), or to set fire to objects with\r\nwhich it comes into immediate or indirect contact, the amount of injury\r\nbeing in part dependent upon the nature and the condition (wet or dry)\r\nof the object and its position in relation to other conductors. Wires\r\nas dangerous as these car wires should be so supported that no ordinary\r\naccident, no condition of the weather, strong winds, or heavy falls of\r\nsnow should be capable of wrenching them from their supports, and they\r\nshould be placed in such positions and with such protection as not to\r\nreceive blows from passing or falling objects.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these wires should be properly insulated. This is to be\r\nunderstood to mean that all the wires which carry the electric current,\r\nor are liable to carry it, should be attached to their poles or other\r\nsupport in such a manner that no appreciable quantity of electricity is\r\nunder any circumstances liable to be diverted to the poles or supports,\r\nand in this way cause destruction or injury. In addition to this the\r\nside wires should be so covered that if any accident occurs, it will\r\nbe difficult or impossible for the current to pass away from them to\r\nother objects. The middle wire on which the trolley runs cannot be\r\nthus covered, but must be left bare, and hence, if knocked down or\r\nbrought into contact with properly conducting objects, must be the most\r\ndangerous; but on the other hand from its position it is less liable to\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nWhen we say that these wires should be properly protected we mean that\r\nsuch arrangements and contrivances should be used as will prevent them\r\nwhile in their usual position from coming into contact with dangerous\r\nobjects, particularly with other wires. This may be accomplished by\r\nguard wires or in other ways. It is plainly of great importance that\r\nthis should be specially cared for, and particularly in a city where\r\nthere are many overhead wires, and perhaps a considerable number of\r\ndead or non-used wires. If the electricity comes into contact with one\r\nof these no one can tell where it may be transmitted or what harm it\r\nmay do.\r\n\r\nThe principles which apply to these overhead wires of course apply\r\n_ceteris paribus_ to all other electric overhead wires, and in like\r\nmanner the statements made in regard to the diffusion or spreading\r\nof currents in underground wires are applicable to all methods of\r\ntransmitting electricity mechanically through the ground so far as the\r\nconditions are similar. An electric current will always follow the path\r\nof best conduction, and where several paths are opened it will follow\r\nthem proportionally according to the excellence of their conduction or\r\ninversely to the amount of their electric resistance.\r\n\r\nWe shall not enter here into any questions in regard to the diffusion\r\nof electricity, its transmission through fluids, water, air or other\r\ngases, nor shall we discuss the relations of good or bad conductors to\r\nelectricity except so far as this relates to certain portions of the\r\nhuman body. An elementary knowledge of physics and electricity must be\r\npresupposed.\r\n\r\nWe can now enter more directly upon the immediate subject of this\r\narticle, that is, the effect upon the human body of severe or\r\nmoderately strong currents of electricity derived from artificial\r\nsources. The accidents produced by these currents may be divided into\r\ntwo classes, the direct and the indirect. Under the direct we place\r\nall those conditions which are apparently produced by the action\r\nof the electricity itself, such as the general shock, the loss of\r\nconsciousness, the burns, etc. On the other hand, all those accidents\r\nare to be considered indirect which are not primarily due to the action\r\nof the electric current, but are only secondary results thereof. These\r\nare largely determined by the immediate surroundings and conditions at\r\nthe time. Such, for example, are the surgical injuries due to falls\r\ncaused by the loss of consciousness produced by the electric shock.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIRECT ACCIDENTS.\r\n\r\nThese will be considered first, as they do not demand so detailed a\r\ndescription as the direct. They are traumatic in character and are the\r\nresult either of loss of consciousness, momentary or lasting, or of\r\nthe involuntary muscular contraction which may be occasioned by the\r\nelectric shock. They are among the most frequent effects of severe\r\nelectric shocks. These accidents consist in contusions, fractures,\r\ndislocations, wounds, and any other injuries which may be produced from\r\nsudden loss of consciousness while in a dangerous position. Death may\r\nreadily occur either immediately or as the more or less delayed result\r\nof such injuries. If the person shocked falls into the water he may be\r\ndrowned, or if into the fire he will be burnt. The varieties of such\r\naccidents dependent on the sudden loss of consciousness produced by\r\nthe electricity are, of course, innumerable, and their occurrence must\r\nlargely depend upon the position of the victim at the moment of the\r\nshock. We see, perhaps, most of these accidents in linemen on the tops\r\nof poles or houses or in other exposed places, but persons who receive\r\nshocks when simply standing on the ground or when sitting are not\r\nexempt from severe surgical injuries other than burns. They are often\r\ncast to the ground with great violence, and not infrequently are thrown\r\nto a distance of several feet. This is caused by the violent muscular\r\ncontraction produced by the electric shock, and it may occasion, like\r\nany violent push or fall, severe injuries from contact with the\r\nvarious objects against which they may be forced. Although much rarer,\r\nit is also possible that the violence of these muscular contractions\r\nmay be such as of themselves to cause injury, as rupture of a muscle or\r\ntendon. As practically all these indirect accidents are traumatic and\r\nsurgical in character, they do not differ from other accidents similar\r\nin kind, but otherwise caused, and are to be treated on the same\r\ngeneral principles as these.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECT ACCIDENTS.\r\n\r\nQuite different from the indirect are the direct accidents; those\r\nproduced by the immediate (direct) action of the electricity. These\r\nare of various kinds, which we shall consider separately. They may be\r\ndivided into immediate and late symptoms, and they vary much according\r\nto the severity of the shock and the constitution of the patient,\r\nand the part of the body through which the electricity passes. The\r\ncharacter of the current which gives the shock, whether constant or\r\ninterrupted, also naturally has an influence on the effect.\r\n\r\n=General Principles.=—A shock may be given in three ways with an\r\nordinary galvanic battery. If the current be sufficiently strong, a\r\ndistinct shock will be produced when the circuit is closed and again\r\nwhen the circuit is opened, while with a current of the usual strength\r\nfor medical purposes, the sensation while the current is passing\r\nthrough the body steadily is much less and is often limited to a\r\nsensation of burning at the seat of the electrode. A shock may also\r\n(thirdly) be produced by a reversal of the current, and the shock thus\r\ncaused is stronger for the same current than that produced in either of\r\nthe other ways.\r\n\r\nThe strength of these shocks is shown both by the sensation produced\r\nand by the amount of muscular contraction caused. When now a shock\r\nis caused by a continuous or constant current which starts from\r\nan ordinary dynamo or other electric generator or storer, it is\r\npractically always caused by the opening or closing of the circuit,\r\nor, what is essentially the same, the diversion of a part or the whole\r\nof the current from its proper path to and through some portion of the\r\nhuman body causes a shock at the time of the entrance of the body into\r\nthe circuit and another at the time of its exit therefrom. Shocks\r\nfrom reversal of current when such current arises from a constant\r\nmachine might occur, but only through some peculiar accident. Hence\r\nthe shocks (distinguished from any other effects of electricity) which\r\nare received by the person coming into contact with a constant current\r\nare felt only at the moment of entering the circuit (closure) and of\r\nleaving it (opening). If a person introduces himself between the two\r\nwires of an electric circuit in which a constant current is used, in\r\nsuch a manner as to cause the current to pass through his body, he\r\nwill feel the shock only at the moment when he touches the second wire\r\nand completes the circuit, and at the moment when he lets go one of\r\nthe wires and opens the circuit (unless the current be so strong or\r\nbe so placed that he can divert to himself sufficient electricity to\r\ncause a shock, or, in other words, close a secondary circuit in some\r\nother way). While the current is passing through the body, although it\r\nmay burn and cause tingling and other unpleasant symptoms, there is\r\nno proper shock. In other words, an electric shock is caused only by\r\na _change_ in the amount of electricity passing through the body or a\r\nportion thereof.\r\n\r\nIf we now consider the effects of =alternating currents=, we find\r\nthat we have another factor to deal with. The general principles are\r\nexactly the same, but inasmuch as the reversal shock is stronger than\r\nthe closure or opening shocks, other things being equal, we are likely\r\nto receive a stronger shock from a current of the same force, and in\r\naddition to this, as in alternating machines the reversals occur with\r\nconsiderable rapidity, the person who becomes connected with this\r\ncircuit receives a number of strong shocks within a short space of\r\ntime. This is a much more serious matter than to permit a current of\r\nequal strength to flow through the body without change.\r\n\r\n—The effect of this form of electricity on the human body is first\r\nstimulating and then tetanizing to the muscles. It consists in a very\r\nrapidly interrupted current, the shocks being at times so frequent that\r\nthey are not singly perceptible. There is probably also a distinct\r\ndifference in the action of this current from that of the galvanic\r\ncurrent aside from its rapid interruption. This is not, however, of so\r\ndefined a character as to enable us at the present time to distinguish\r\nin man the results of severe injuries and deaths caused by this form\r\nfrom those caused by other strong currents. Practically this form of\r\ncurrent is but little used, except in medical batteries and for the\r\npurposes of experimentation in laboratories.\r\n\r\n=Static electricity= has, so far as we know, rarely or never caused\r\nserious injuries or death. The sparks produced in this way have\r\nsometimes caused burns, and it is conceivable that a strong electric\r\ncurrent produced in this way might be dangerous. The symptoms could not\r\nbe distinguished from those caused by other forms of electricity.\r\n\r\n=Summary.=—The greatest source of danger from electric currents is the\r\nshock produced by them. In ordinary constant or continuous currents\r\nthis is produced only at the moment of the opening and the closure of\r\nthe circuit. In alternating currents a shock is also produced at each\r\nreversal of the machine. Faradic and static currents are rarely or\r\nnever used mechanically or in the arts.\r\n\r\n=Resistance.=—The resistance of the human body to electric currents\r\nhas been very variously estimated.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for these variations are: (1) that the different tissues\r\npresent different resistances; (2) that the resistance in the same\r\ntissue varies greatly under different circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe tissue which offers the greatest resistance and also practically\r\nthe greatest variation is the skin, or, more properly speaking, the\r\nepidermis. The resistance of this is many times as great as that of the\r\nrest of the body, and when perfectly dry it is impervious to currents\r\nof great strength. Witz states that in using a Ruhmkorf coil with an\r\nestimated force of 250,000 volts in Guinea-pigs and rabbits, it is\r\nadvisable to cut through the skin in order to apply the electrodes\r\ndirectly to the flesh, or, at least, to wet the skin thoroughly,\r\notherwise the shock caused by the full strength of the battery (six\r\njars charged from the coil) would not cause death. Various animals\r\noffer rates of resistance which vary somewhat apparently according to\r\nthe nature of the animal, but are probably largely dependent on the\r\nconducting power of its tissues, that is, of its skin. The variations\r\nbetween the resistance of similar animals, according to the condition\r\nof the skin at the time of the experiment, are much greater than those\r\nwhich are found between animals of different species under similar\r\nconditions, or which are referable to specific susceptibility. Mr.\r\nHarold P. Brown testified in the Kemmler case (Court of Appeals, State\r\nof New York—State of New York _ex rel._ William Kemmler against\r\nCharles F. Durston, agent and warden) that he had in the course of his\r\nexperiments seen a horse weighing 1,320 pounds, with a resistance of\r\n11,000 ohms, killed by an alternating current at 700 volts.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of the different cutaneous surfaces of the human body\r\nas measured by Jolly in Siemens’ units was from 400,000 down to 15,000\r\nin the male and to 8,000 in the female (Siemens’ unit is to the ohm as\r\n1.06 to 1.00).\r\n\r\nTschirfew and Watteville made the resistance from 80,000 to 3,000 ohms.\r\n\r\nExperiments made at the Edison Phonograph Factory and Edison Laboratory\r\nin July, 1889, on 259 males between the ages of eleven and fifty-one,\r\nshowed a resistance, measured between the hands immersed to the wrists\r\nin a solution of caustic potash independent of polarization, averaging\r\n986 ohms and varying from 1,970 to 550 ohms.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of 236 men employed at Messrs. Bergmann & Co.’s\r\nElectrical Works in New York appears to have averaged 1,184 ohms and\r\nto have varied from 1,870 to 610 ohms. These measurements were also\r\ntaken between the hands, which were washed with soap and water and then\r\ndipped in jars containing a solution of caustic potash. The battery\r\nconsisted of four chromic-acid cells each having an E. M. F. of 2 volts.\r\n\r\nAs shown in all the experiments on animals and more especially in the\r\ncases of electrocution, the continuance or duration of the current has\r\nmuch effect on the resistance. As the current continues the resistance\r\ndiminishes. Thus in the case of McElvaine the resistance between the\r\nimmersed hands was at the beginning 800 ohms and at the end of the\r\ncontact of fifty seconds had decreased to 516 ohms. In this case, when\r\nthe current of 1,500 volts was applied from the forehead to the leg,\r\nthe resistance was practically steady at only 214 ohms. Of course the\r\nsmall resistance in these cases (electrocutions) depends largely on the\r\nperfect contact secured.\r\n\r\nAccording to the amount of resistance offered do the effects of severe\r\nshocks of electricity differ. This is shown especially well in the\r\naction of lightning, but is also true of powerful currents produced\r\nmechanically. If the resistance of the skin be slight at the moment of\r\nentering the circuit of a strong current, the current will pass through\r\nit with comparative ease and without causing much injury; but if on the\r\nother hand the resistance is great, the current will be, as it were,\r\nmomentarily retarded or stored, heat will be developed, and there will\r\nensue a burning and charring of the tissue of a special kind. These\r\nburns occur principally at the places where the current is specially\r\nresisted, that is, at the point of entrance of the current to the body\r\nand at its point of exit. This is the cause of the frequent burns in\r\nthe heel or sole of the foot in the case of those struck by lightning\r\nwhile standing, as the electricity passes away from the body into the\r\nground and finds a strong resistance at the point of leaving the body.\r\nThis is also the cause of the burns where the current leaves the body\r\nfrom any other cause, as from the contact or proximity of a metallic\r\nobject. The greater the resistance so long as the current passes, other\r\nthings being equal, the more severe is the burn. It is for this reason\r\nthat in medical electricity we usually use wet sponges on the skin or\r\nelectrodes moistened with salt and water or with other fluids which\r\nwill assist in rendering the passage of the electricity through the\r\nskin more easy. Solutions of chlorid of sodium and of certain other\r\nsalts do this.\r\n\r\n=The mechanical effects= of currents vary thus according to the\r\nresistance encountered. They also vary according to the intensity or\r\nconcentration of the current. If a current of moderate force be applied\r\nthrough a small metallic point, it will burn, pain, and produce active\r\nirritative symptoms, while if the same amount be applied over a large\r\nsurface simultaneously, it may have little or no irritating effect. We\r\nhave, therefore, three factors in determining the mechanical effect of\r\nany electric current on the body: (1) the condition of the body, that\r\nis, the amount of resistance which the current will encounter at its\r\nentrance and exit; (2) the amount and intensity of the current; and (3)\r\nthe character of the current. For practical purposes of the more severe\r\ncurrents we have only to deal with the continuous and alternating.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECT SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nThe direct symptoms produced by powerful mechanical currents of\r\nelectricity may be divided into three classes: I. The mechanical; II.\r\nThe essential or internal; III. The mental or psychical.\r\n\r\nThese classes are fairly distinct, but they are not absolute, and\r\ncertain symptoms are on the borders.\r\n\r\nThe most important mechanical symptoms produced by these currents are\r\n=burns=. These occur at all points of strong resistance externally,\r\nhence especially at the points of entrance and departure of the\r\ncurrent. They vary from all grades, from the lightest possible, where\r\nonly the fine hairs on the skin are singed, to those of extraordinary\r\ndepth and severity. The characteristic burn from powerful currents\r\nis, however, well distinguished. It consists in a deep hole of\r\nvarious shapes with clear-cut edges surrounded by an inflamed area\r\nand containing in its cavity a mass of blackened tissue which only\r\nseparates from the portions below after several days, and causes\r\na wound which, though not very painful, heals very slowly. The\r\nseverity of electric burns is often at first sight underrated, and\r\ntheir duration, when severe, is unexpectedly long. It occasionally\r\nhappens that after a burn of this character appears nearly healed, the\r\nsurrounding and, in appearance, healthy tissue breaks down, perhaps\r\nunder a healthy skin, and a destructive process occurs which much\r\nretards recovery. This is evidently due to tissue destruction from a\r\nstrong electric current of such a character as to produce necrobiosis\r\nwithout the external appearances of a burn. These burns are, perhaps,\r\noftenest seen on the hands, but this is only because these parts are\r\nmore likely to come into contact with the current. They may occur in\r\nany portion of the body.\r\n\r\n=Eyes.=—The injurious effect of electric light upon the eyes has been\r\ncarefully studied by several competent observers. So far as known it\r\nhas been caused solely by the arc light. The symptoms produced by\r\nexposure of the eyes for a considerable period to the electric light\r\nmay be slight or severe. In the slighter cases we find merely an acute\r\nconjunctivitis with a slight central scotoma which passes off within\r\ntwenty-four to forty-eight hours. The symptoms are those usual in acute\r\nconjunctivitis—photophobia, lachrymation, sensation of a foreign body\r\nunder the lids, discomfort in the eyes, and swelling of the lids. In\r\nthe more severe cases all these symptoms are increased; the photophobia\r\nand lachrymation may be intense. There is sometimes severe pain in\r\nthe supra-orbital nerve, and occasionally a tendency to somnolence.\r\nIn these cases we find an intense conjunctivitis with chymosis, a\r\ncentral scotoma which may render the patient for the time practically\r\nblind, and on ophthalmoscopic examination a congestion of the vessels\r\nof the retina and choroid, a neuro-retinitis, and sometimes even\r\nhemorrhages into the retina. There is sometimes peripapillary œdema\r\nand infiltration around the optic nerve. The pupil of the eye in these\r\ncases is usually much contracted. There is sometimes loss of epithelium\r\nfrom the cornea.\r\n\r\nIn certain severe cases there is produced in addition to the eye\r\nsymptoms an erythema of the face. Bresse states that this erythema can\r\nbe produced on the face, arm, or hand by exposure to the voltaic arc\r\nat a distance of thirty to forty centimetres. The blush grows deeper\r\nfor three or four hours, then remains stationary for a time, and ends\r\nin desquamation leaving a very durable pigmentation. The erythema is\r\naccompanied by a sensation of smarting.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the light and the length of time required to produce\r\nthese effects probably vary somewhat according to the color of the\r\nlight. Emrys Jones states that he is informed that either excess or\r\ndefect of current gives a less injurious light than the normal current;\r\nthe excess gives a more violet, the defect a more orange light. On the\r\nother hand, Charcot considered that the harmfulness of the electric\r\nlight was due at any rate in considerable part to the chemical or\r\nviolet rays, and Bresse found that when violet rays were added to an\r\nelectric light as by aluminium it was more injurious than before to\r\nanimals. What part the brilliancy of the light plays in determining\r\nthe pathological results is not yet fully settled. The heat, however,\r\ndoes not, as a rule, seem to have much effect unless in extraordinary\r\ninstances where the cornea is burned.\r\n\r\n=Muscular Contractions.=—Another effect of electricity which is\r\nexternally visible on the human system is muscular contraction.\r\nSlight muscular contractions are produced purposely in many cases in\r\nmedical treatment therapeutically or for the sake of diagnosis. When\r\nthe stimuli are sufficiently strong and follow each other with great\r\nrapidity, or when a strong continuous current is passed through the\r\nmuscles, they are brought into a state of continuous contraction or\r\ntetanus, and in this condition they will remain for a long period\r\nor until the electric stimulus is removed. In cases where a severe\r\nelectric shock is received as from an electric wire, the muscles\r\nwhich come in contact with the wire immediately contract and remain\r\ncontracted while the current continues to pass through them. As a\r\nresult of this we often find that when a severe electric shock has been\r\nreceived through the hands by means of a wire or other conductor the\r\nsufferer’s hands are involuntarily closed upon the wire or conductor,\r\nand cannot be unclosed by any voluntary effort until the current is\r\nstopped. While thus holding the conductor the hands are often very\r\nseverely burnt. Under these circumstances a strong force is required to\r\nremove a person from a charged wire if the current be not turned off,\r\nand it can only be done at a considerable risk unless by those expert\r\nand provided with special means.\r\n\r\nNot only the muscles immediately in contact with the conductor, but\r\nnearly all the voluntary muscles of the body may be thus affected\r\nby a powerful current. Another effect of this involuntary muscular\r\ncontraction is the forcible muscular movements produced by the shock.\r\nAs previously stated, when a sufficiently strong shock occurs, the\r\nvoluntary muscles of the trunk and limbs may be thrown into sudden\r\ncontraction in such a manner as to throw the person violently and\r\nforcibly on to the ground, or against some object or objects in the\r\nneighborhood. In this way one may be propelled several feet, and many\r\nvarieties of surgical injury may be caused. Rarely the force of the\r\ncontraction is such as of itself to rupture muscles or tendons, and it\r\nmight even fracture bones or dislocate joints already predisposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nESSENTIAL OR INTERNAL SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nWe pass now to what we may consider the internal or essential\r\nconditions of electric shock, leaving the mental or psychical results\r\nfor examination later.\r\n\r\nWhen a person receives a severe electric shock, the symptoms are\r\nusually as follows: In the first place there may be little or nothing\r\nexcept a burn or burns, though usually there is some sensation at the\r\nmoment of the shock. This may be a simple dizziness, and is often\r\naccompanied by the sensation of a brilliant flash of light before the\r\neyes, and sometimes by a sense of impending danger. Usually, however,\r\nthere is a loss of consciousness more or less complete and more or\r\nless lasting according to the severity of the shock and the character\r\nand course of the current. In the less severe cases this gradually\r\npasses away, and in many cases the patient, although weak and feeling\r\nshaken and tired, suffers no further ill effects beyond those of the\r\nburns and mechanical injuries. Sometimes there follows a general tremor\r\nwhich may last a few hours or for days, and occasionally a clonic\r\nrhythmical spasm of one or more extremities. The loss of consciousness\r\nmay, however, be accompanied or followed by a condition of collapse,\r\nin which the pale face, profuse perspiration, cold extremities,\r\nand feeble pulse all suggest the administration of stimulants and\r\nrestoratives. As a rule, in the stage of unconsciousness the face is\r\nreddened and rather cyanotic. The pupils are dilated as a rule and the\r\nrespiration stertorous or absent; the pulse may be full or feeble,\r\nsometimes imperceptible for a time. The unconsciousness sometimes\r\nlasts for hours, and all means of stimulation, electricity, artificial\r\nrespiration, rubbing, have to be applied before the patient can be\r\nrestored. Sometimes this condition is succeeded by delirium (Moyer). In\r\na certain number of cases the shock is immediately fatal, and in others\r\nthe patients cannot be recalled from their unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nThe secondary results of the shock, aside from the injuries, may be\r\nvery slight or again may be serious and lasting. They are far more\r\napt to be of the first class, and when long or continued motor or\r\nsensory changes unconnected with injuries follow, we are justified\r\nin suspecting mental or psychical phenomena. One class of secondary\r\nresults is the motor. In addition to weakness, unsteadiness and tremor\r\nof the limbs and trunk, it is not uncommon for the patient to suffer\r\nfrom grand rhythmical movements, at first, perhaps, of all extremities,\r\nbut soon limited to the extremity or extremities which were most\r\nexposed or injured by the current. We have personally seen these\r\nmovements, and feel convinced that they can be distinguished from most\r\nof the ordinary forms of convulsive motions and tremors. The whole\r\nlimb is moved at once and not separate muscles, and the movement is a\r\nlarge, rhythmical one, slow and co-ordinated, not at all suggestive of\r\ntremor. Movements of this character are sometimes seen in so-called\r\nfunctional disease (hysteria and allied conditions). They more nearly\r\nresemble the movements seen in some forms of Jacksonian epilepsy\r\nthan any others known to me as occurring in organic disease, but I\r\nbelieve them in these cases to be always strongly suggestive, if not\r\nabsolutely significant, of functional affections. A case reported by\r\nDr. Robert, of El Paso, well illustrates this condition. The patient,\r\na male, twenty-eight years old, received a shock through a telephone\r\nwire. When seen first, reaction was slowly taking place, the entire\r\nmuscular system was in clonic convulsions. Temperature 97°; pulse\r\nrapid and of low tension; respiration 50; no cerebral symptoms. An\r\nhour later the movements were limited to the left upper and the right\r\nlower extremities, and there was pain running from the region of the\r\nspine down the left arm. Twenty-four hours after the shock, temperature\r\n99.5°; respiration 40; pulse 100. Had slept well, but the movements in\r\nthe left arm had never ceased. The next day these motions were limited\r\nto the muscles of the forearm, and on the fourth day they had wholly\r\nceased. These convulsions consisted in extensive motions of the whole\r\nextremity or of muscles or muscle-groups, and not of simple tremor. If\r\nthe movements were forcibly controlled, severe pain ensued.\r\n\r\nNext to the motor symptoms the sensory are the most important. Pain\r\nnot infrequently occurs after the recovery of consciousness in the\r\naffected limb; it is apt to be sharp, severe, darting and neuralgic\r\nin character. This may last at intervals for some days, a dull ache\r\noccurring at first between the intermissions. It disappears of itself\r\nin time without lasting effects.\r\n\r\nHyperæsthesia may exist at first. Should this continue, or if\r\nanæsthesia not due to secondary traumatic conditions should appear\r\nlater, we should be inclined to place these symptoms in the third class.\r\n\r\nOf other symptoms occurring in accidents from currents of high\r\npotential, those which seem to be due to the direct action of the\r\nelectricity are not serious. Buzzing in the ears and a metallic taste\r\nin the mouth often occur at the very beginning before the consciousness\r\nis involved. Nausea and vomiting frequently occur later. There is\r\noften considerable dizziness and vertigo. Patients sometimes complain\r\nof sensations as of an electric shock running through the body which\r\noccur without cause some hours or even days after the real shock. Some\r\nof these sensations are certainly to be reckoned under the mental or\r\npsychical symptoms. Susceptibility to the effects of electricity, of\r\nlightning, and of thunder-storms, though undoubtedly in many cases\r\npsychical, has probably in some cases an actual foundation. This is\r\ncertainly the case in lightning stroke. On the other hand, in the large\r\nmajority of cases of electric accidents no such result follows, and in\r\nmany we are expressly told that such a result was looked for but not\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe temperature, as affected by the electricity alone and not as\r\nsecondary result of injuries, is not always easy to determine. It seems\r\nto be in most cases lowered at first, being in that of Moyer 97.5° and\r\nin that of Robert 97°. Later it may rise to a certain extent, usually\r\nto not more than 101°, but here again the influence of traumata is\r\ndifficult to separate.\r\n\r\nThe pulse may be full and soft or weak and compressible. It is\r\nfrequently very feeble, sometimes almost imperceptible, and often\r\nrapid. It is apt to remain rapid and somewhat soft for days in severe\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe respiration is at first rapid in severe cases unless the shock be\r\nso great as to cause its cessation. This rapidity remains for a varying\r\nperiod and then disappears.\r\n\r\nAs a typical case of the results of shock from an electric wire, we\r\nwill mention the one reported by Dr. F. W. Jackson. The patient, a\r\nman twenty-two years old, came in contact with a live electric-light\r\nwire, touching it with his hands. He was thrown a distance of about\r\nten feet and then back again, “swinging back and forth two or three\r\ntimes.” His hands were in contact with the wire about three minutes,\r\nwhen the current broke and he fell to the ground unconscious. Was seen\r\ntwo hours later by physician. Temperature 100°; pulse 100, strong and\r\nbounding; pupils dilated; headache; nervous and irritable; reflexes\r\nincreased. The headache was accompanied by insomnia which continued for\r\nthree days, after which it disappeared, and he resumed work apparently\r\nnone the worse for his accident. The palmar surfaces of both hands\r\nand the anterior surfaces of the forearms were blackened from the tips\r\nof the fingers to a point midway between the wrists and the elbows,\r\nand these parts were exceedingly sensitive to the touch. The least\r\nirritation of the muscles would cause them to contract violently. This\r\ncondition ceased on the second day. The current was from a fifty-light\r\narc circuit of about 2,100 volts; 6.8 amperes. The accident took place\r\nout-of-doors on a very rainy night. The amount of electricity which the\r\npatient received was, as in all such cases, very uncertain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATAL CURRENT.\r\n\r\nThe amount of current which will produce a fatal effect varies with\r\nthe character of the current and with the points of contact. Currents\r\npassing through the head or those which affect the pneumogastric nerves\r\nare much more dangerous than others of the same character and equal\r\nstrength passing through one extremity, for example.\r\n\r\nThe same current will, of course, also produce different effects,\r\naccording to the facility of its conduction into and through the body,\r\nand this depends again on the completeness of the contact and whether\r\nthe body or the portion thereof concerned enters directly into the\r\ncircuit or only forms, as it were, a partial conductor and diverts a\r\ncertain portion only of the current to itself. Again, the condition of\r\nthe epidermis, whether dry or wet, and the position of the person in\r\nrelation to good conductors, metallic or otherwise, has much effect.\r\n\r\nIf the skin and clothes be wet, the resistance to the current is\r\nlessened and it passes more readily into the body. In the same way, if\r\na person stands in close relation to a good conductor and places his\r\nhand on one wire of a high-tension electric circuit, he will receive a\r\nmuch more severe shock than if not connected with such conductor. Thus\r\na person standing in a pool of water (water is a good conductor), and\r\nmore strongly if standing on the metallic rail of a railway track, and\r\ntouching one wire of an electric circuit with one hand, receives a much\r\nstronger shock than if he were standing on dry land, or if his boots\r\nwere rubber or he was otherwise insulated.\r\n\r\nThe accidents most frequent in practice are those in which the current\r\nhas been partially diverted from its original course and the person has\r\nnot entered fully into the circuit. In such cases it is not usually\r\npossible to estimate accurately or even approximately the amount of\r\ncurrent which the person has received. No calculations can, therefore,\r\nbe based on these accidents. Again, we find that a person may be\r\nseriously or even fatally injured by a current which another person\r\nseems to bear with impunity.\r\n\r\nD’Arsonval in 1887, in France, advised 500 volts as the maximum for\r\nthe continuous current and 60 volts as the maximum for the alternating\r\ncurrent which might be employed without special permission.\r\n\r\nOur only accurate knowledge in regard to fatal currents comes from the\r\nexperience derived from electrocutions. From these it appears that an\r\nalternating current of 1,500 volts is deadly if it passes through the\r\nbody for more than a few seconds and if the contact is perfect.\r\n\r\n=Death.=—Death may ensue immediately as the result of an electric\r\nshock without any evident preliminary symptoms, or it may occur later,\r\neither as the direct result of the shock or as the consequence of the\r\nexhaustion produced by the burns and other injuries, or directly from\r\nthe injuries themselves. If death does not occur immediately and if\r\nappropriate means of aid are at hand, the sufferer usually survives\r\nand the effect of the electric shock gradually passes away. The danger\r\nafter this arises from the burns and other injuries, and almost all the\r\ndeaths not immediate are the results of these.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTROCUTION.\r\n\r\nElectricity has been adopted in the State of New York as the agent\r\nfor the execution of condemned criminals. This has given rise to much\r\ndiscussion as to what form of current were the best adapted for this\r\npurpose and as to what amount were required to produce death at once\r\nand painlessly. These questions may now be regarded as practically\r\nsettled, at least so far as regards the purposes mentioned, and we\r\nshall only refer incidentally to the discussions and their results.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1890 a committee consisting of Dr. Carlos F. MacDonald, Dr. A.\r\nD. Rockwell, and Prof. L. H. Landy made a report to the superintendent\r\nof prisons at Albany in regard to the efficiency of the electrical\r\nappliances and dynamos placed in the State prisons of Sing Sing,\r\nAuburn, and Clinton. This report gave details of various experiments\r\nmade on animals to determine the amount of current and the time\r\nrequired to produce a fatal result.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of August, 1890, occurred the first electrocution, that of\r\nWilliam Kemmler, alias John Hart, at Auburn Prison. Dr. MacDonald in\r\nhis official report to the governor in relation to this says: “It is\r\nconfidently believed that when all the facts in the case are rightly\r\nunderstood the first execution by electricity will be regarded as\r\na successful experiment. As might have been expected at the first\r\nexecution by this method, there were certain defects of a minor\r\ncharacter in the arrangement and operation of the apparatus. But in\r\nspite of these defects the important fact remains that unconsciousness\r\nwas instantly effected and death was painless.”\r\n\r\nThe efficiency, rapidity, and painlessness of this form of execution\r\nhave been confirmed by the later experiences. Up to the present date\r\n(May 26th, 1892) eight condemned criminals have been executed in the\r\nState of New York. Apparently all the officials who are intrusted with\r\nthe care and inspection of this subject seem satisfied that this is, on\r\nthe whole, the wisest, easiest, and most effective form of death thus\r\nfar practised among civilized nations. The _Medico-Legal Journal_ of\r\nNew York, in printing the official report of the recent executions of\r\nfour men made by Drs. C. F. MacDonald and S. B. Ward to the warden of\r\nSing Sing Prison, states that it furnishes “indisputable evidence of\r\nthe fact (1) that the deaths were painless and the victims unconscious\r\nfrom the instant of contact; (2) that they were certain and unattended\r\nwith any of the revolting scenes so frequently witnessed at the\r\nscaffold; (3) that the method is humane so far as inflicting physical\r\npain or suffering, and from all sides considered infinitely preferable\r\nto the death by hanging; and that so long as capital punishment for\r\nmurder exists in New York, we need not desire to change the method of\r\npunishment.” These claims would seem to be thus far substantiated.\r\n\r\nThe value of this method of execution is now beyond doubt. When\r\nproperly performed it is rapid, painless, and not repulsive. The\r\ncriminal has probably no physical sensation of pain or discomfort due\r\nto the mode of death from the moment the first shock occurs. Since the\r\nrapidity of the transmission of the electric current through the body\r\nis in these cases much greater than the rapidity of the transmission\r\nof sensation, it seems just to conclude that no sensation from the\r\nelectricity reaches the consciousness. The only distress suffered\r\nby the criminal is the unavoidable mental suffering natural to his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical means employed in electrocution are practically the\r\nsame at Sing Sing, Clinton, and Auburn prisons. A special room is\r\nprovided for the purpose, which should be, if possible, in the\r\nbasement with a concrete floor: this room must be of sufficient size\r\nto admit readily the criminal with the attendant officers, the warden\r\nand other officials in charge or on duty at the execution, and the\r\nwitnesses for whom seats are usually provided at a little distance\r\nfrom the criminal’s chair, and also to allow of plenty of room for the\r\nmanagement of the electrical apparatus, and a good space around the\r\nchair in which the criminal is placed. The electrical plant consists of\r\nan alternating-current dynamo and its accessories, placed wherever may\r\nbe convenient, according to the arrangements of the buildings of the\r\ninstitution, but connected by means of wires with the switch-board in\r\nthe execution-room. In the execution-room also should be the voltmeter,\r\nthe ammeter, and such other instruments of measurement or precision as\r\nmay be required. In charge of these and of the switch-board during the\r\nexecution is the electrical expert, an official paid by the State of\r\nNew York. Means of communication by electric bells or otherwise are, of\r\ncourse, arranged between the execution-room and the engineer in charge\r\nof the dynamo, so that the current can be produced as desired.\r\n\r\nThe chair in which the criminal is placed is made of stout beams of oak\r\nand is securely fastened to the floor and insulated. It is perfectly\r\nplain, with broad arms and an upright back, which latter can be tilted\r\nbackward a little by means of a special arrangement and firmly fixed in\r\nthe desired position. This is accomplished by means of a bar of wood\r\nwhich is firmly attached at one end to the lower portion of the back\r\nand runs forward thence parallel to the seat of the chair and alongside\r\nof it; to the anterior end of this is fastened a perpendicular bar\r\nrunning downward, which can be raised or lowered at will, and securely\r\nfastened at any height. As this is raised or lowered, it raises or\r\nlowers the anterior end of the horizontal beam and correspondingly\r\nlowers or raises the opposite end to which the back of the chair\r\nis attached, thus moving the latter. When the anterior end of the\r\nhorizontal bar is raised the posterior end is lowered and the back of\r\nthe chair is straightened. Attached to the upper portion of the back of\r\nthe chair is a head-rest, which can be raised or lowered as desired: it\r\nmay, as in the case of Kemmler, have a horizontal arm which projects\r\nforward and from which the head-electrode may be suspended. The chair\r\nis also furnished with broad leather straps firmly attached, two of\r\nwhich pass around the body, one around each upper arm, one around each\r\nlower arm, and one around each leg. There is also a broad conjoined\r\nor compound strap which passes over the head, encircling the forehead\r\nand the chin and securing the head firmly to the head-rest. When\r\nthese straps are properly adjusted and fastened, any marked degree of\r\nmovement is impossible. The adjustment and fastening of these straps\r\ncan be performed very rapidly, in practiced hands taking not more than\r\nforty seconds.\r\n\r\nThe electrodes used have varied slightly in different cases. In the\r\ncase of Kemmler they each consisted of a bell-shaped rubber cup about\r\nfour inches in diameter, with a wooden handle through which passed\r\nthe wires into the bell to end in a metallic disk about three inches\r\nin diameter, faced with sponge. The upper electrode was so arranged\r\nas to rest firmly on the top of the head, where it was held closely\r\nby means of a spiral spring: it was attached to the horizontal arm of\r\nthe head-rest, a sliding arrangement shaped like a figure 4.\r\nThe lower electrode was in this case attached to the lower part of the\r\nback of the chair, and projected forward at a level with the hollow of\r\nthe sacrum. There was also connected with it a sliding arrangement,\r\nand a spiral spring which in connection with a broad strap around the\r\nprisoner’s lower abdomen rendered contact secure.\r\n\r\nIn the later executions these electrodes have been somewhat modified\r\nand differently applied. The head-electrode is now so formed as to\r\ncover the forehead and temples, and can be easily fastened in this\r\nposition without a spring. The lower electrodes have been applied to\r\nthe leg in each case, sometimes apparently to the calf and sometimes\r\nmore to the outer side, where they are securely strapped. They are\r\nmade of such a shape as to cover a considerable portion of the surface\r\nin this region. It is not a matter of importance to which leg the\r\nindifferent electrode is attached, but they have actually been applied\r\nin most cases to the right leg, though in some they were attached to\r\nthe left. They are thoroughly moistened, usually with a solution of\r\nsalt and water, and a drip may be arranged so as to keep them wet\r\nduring the passage of the current or other means employed to this\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe electromotive pressure, as shown by readings of the voltmeter by\r\nProfessor Laudy, in the cases of Slocum, Smiler, Hood, Jugigo, and\r\nLoppy, varied from 1,458 to 1,716 volts. The ammeter showed a variation\r\nof from two to seven amperes.\r\n\r\nThe alternating current in the case of McElvaine made roughly 150\r\nperiods per second.\r\n\r\nThe number of contacts made in each case and the duration of each\r\ncontact were as follows:\r\n\r\n  ═══════════════════╤════════════╤═════════════════════════════════════\r\n                     │            │           TIME, SECONDS.\r\n                     │ Number of  ├─────────┬────────┬────────┬─────────\r\n                     │ Contacts.  │  1st.   │   2d.  │   3d.  │  4th.\r\n  ───────────────────┼────────────┼─────────┼────────┼────────┼─────────\r\n  Kemmler            │      2     │    17   │   70   │        │\r\n  Slocum             │      2     │    27   │   26   │        │\r\n  Smiler             │      4     │    10   │   10   │   10   │   19\r\n  Hood               │      3     │    20   │   20   │   20   │\r\n  Jugigo             │      3     │    15   │   15   │   15   │\r\n  Loppy              │      4     │    15   │   11   │   15½  │   10½\r\n  McElvaine          │      2     │    50   │   36   │        │\r\n  Tice               │      4     │          Total time, 50.\r\n  ───────────────────┴────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\nIn the case of McElvaine, the first contact of fifty seconds was made\r\nthrough the hands, the second contact of thirty-six seconds from the\r\nhead to the leg. The hands were immersed in cells containing tepid\r\nsalt water, connected respectively with the opposite poles of the\r\ndynamo. Kennelly states that in this case, with the hands immersed\r\nand the electromotive force at 1,600 volts, the current began at 2.0\r\namperes, and in fifty seconds had increased to 3.1 amperes, indicating\r\na resistance between the electrodes of from 800 ohms at the beginning\r\nto 516 ohms at the end. In the second application from the forehead\r\nto the leg with an electromotive force of 1,500 volts, the current\r\namounted to 7.0 amperes during the thirty-six seconds contact,\r\nindicating a resistance practically steady at 214 ohms.\r\n\r\nAlternating currents of from 1,600 to 1,700 volts and upward may be\r\nconsidered fatal currents, and as capable of producing death when\r\ncontact is perfect. Dr. MacDonald goes so far as to say: No human being\r\ncould survive the passage through his body of an alternating current\r\nof more than 1,500 volts for a period of even twenty seconds, contact\r\nbeing perfect.”\r\n\r\nThe physical phenomena caused in the body by electrocution as at\r\npresent conducted are comparatively simple, and such as we should\r\nlogically expect. The instant the body of the patient enters into the\r\ncircuit of the current, all the voluntary muscles appear to be thrown\r\ninto a condition of violent contraction which continues so long as\r\nthe current lasts, and on cessation of the current is replaced by\r\na condition of extreme muscular relaxation. All _consciousness_ is\r\napparently lost immediately on the application of the current. This\r\nprobably has never returned in any case, but on the removal of the body\r\nfrom the circuit of the current the relaxation of the muscles causes\r\nmovement, and sometimes, as in the case of Kemmler, slight spasmodic\r\nmovements of the chest have occurred. The pupils in this case were\r\ndilated. The condition of contraction and rigidity is renewed at each\r\nnew application of the current, to cease immediately when the current\r\nis removed.\r\n\r\nIn Kemmler chest movements and possibly heart-beat occurred after the\r\nfirst contact, the former perhaps half a minute after the cessation of\r\nthe current.\r\n\r\nIn Slocum there were chest movements and radial pulsation after the\r\nfirst contact. In Smiler no movement of the chest, but radial pulsation\r\nafter the third contact. In Jugigo a slight fluttering of the radial\r\npulse when final contact was broken, which rapidly ceased. In Hood no\r\nmovement or pulse-beat.\r\n\r\nIn some of the patients superficial burns have been caused by imperfect\r\ncontact of the electrodes, either on the head or at the position of the\r\nlower electrode. In Kemmler’s case the cerebral cortex was somewhat\r\naffected under the head-electrode.\r\n\r\nThe practical effect of the application of the current to the criminal\r\nfastened in the death-chair, as seen by the bystander, is that\r\nimmediately on its reaching him the whole body is straightened and\r\nrendered rigid in extension, the extremities tend to straighten out,\r\nand the face may grow red and turgid. There is reported at times\r\nswelling and turgidity of the neck. The whole body remains in this\r\ntetanic, stiffened condition until the removal of the current, when all\r\nthe muscles relax and the body sinks back into the chair in a state of\r\ncomplete muscular collapse.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL OR PSYCHICAL SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nThe third class of results which are found after electrical shocks\r\nfrom high-tension currents are the mental or psychical. By the use of\r\nthese terms we do not wish to imply that they are voluntary. They are,\r\nhowever, so far as our present knowledge of pathology reaches, largely\r\nfunctional. This is precisely the class of cases which, when resulting\r\nfrom railway accidents, are placed under the head of railway-brain\r\nor railway-spine. They may be considered in the present state of our\r\nknowledge as traumatic functional neuroses, though it is probable that\r\nwhen our means of examination and investigation are more complete\r\nwe may succeed in discovering a visible or perceptible lesion. The\r\nsymptoms affecting motion and sensation in these cases are frequently\r\naccompanied by others of an emotional character, and in many cases\r\nthere seem to be partially or wholly voluntary conditions and symptoms\r\nwith the involuntary. There is in many cases a characteristic loss or\r\ndiminution of the force and power of volition, but in others this is\r\nnot perceptible.\r\n\r\nThese conditions are so well known when produced by other causes that\r\nwe do not consider it proper to enter into a full consideration of them\r\nhere, but we cannot leave this important subject without a few general\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nNo form of affection or disease has caused more discussion among the\r\nmedical profession or figured more prominently in the courts than this,\r\nand even now there are many questions in relation to these conditions\r\nstill under dispute. Our own view, confirmed both by observation and\r\nexperience, is that the tendency in New England, at least, has been\r\non the whole to underrate the severity, the duration, and the amount\r\nof suffering caused by these conditions. That because there have\r\nbeen cases of malingering, of deception, and of rapid cure after\r\nthe receipt of damages, and because in addition to this a certain\r\nvisible emotional and at times apparently controllable element exists,\r\nthe profession, and above all the laity, are led to conclude that\r\nthis forms the essential condition and basis of the disease. On the\r\ncontrary, in a very large proportion of cases the symptoms are such as\r\ncannot possibly be voluntarily assumed; they produce extreme discomfort\r\nand often much suffering for the patient, and frequently last for\r\nyears, rendering their victims incapable of carrying on their former\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nFortunately in the patients suffering from electric shock the\r\nseverer forms of these affections are not so common. In most of the\r\ncases reported recovery has been more or less rapid. Cases in which\r\nprevious hysteria or neurasthenia have existed are more liable to\r\nthese manifestations than persons of a previously equable nervous\r\nconstitution, but these latter are by no means wholly exempt. To\r\nconsider these conditions, as is sometimes done, as the fault of the\r\npatient seems to us both unwarrantable and unjust.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the consideration of the action of electricity in\r\nanother form, that of natural electricity or lightning. The effects\r\nof this are practically the same as those of the forms previously\r\ndescribed, except such differences as seem to be fairly accounted for\r\nby the vastly greater force of the currents with which we have to\r\ndeal. Injuries and deaths from lightning stroke have been recognized\r\nand described for many centuries, and we have now a large collection\r\nof careful observations on them. They occur in most temperate regions\r\nwith comparative frequency. In France the number of deaths from 1835\r\nto 1852 inclusive (eighteen years) was 1,308. In England, including\r\nWales, there were in twenty years, 1865 to 1884 inclusive, 416 deaths.\r\nIn 1846 Mr. Eben Merriam, of Brookline, wrote to Mr. Arago that in the\r\nthree last years about 150 persons had been killed by lightning in the\r\nUnited States. In thirty years, from 1855 to 1884 inclusive, we find\r\n101 deaths in Massachusetts from this cause.\r\n\r\n=Exposure.=—Injuries and deaths from lightning may occur in various\r\nplaces and under various conditions. The severe lightning strokes are\r\npopularly supposed to occur only during thunder-storms, and in this\r\nlatitude this is undoubtedly, as a rule, true, but lightning strokes\r\nare reported to have occurred, particularly in the South, from a clear\r\nsky, and there seems no reason to doubt that this may happen. It is\r\nsaid also that dangerous discharges from the earth to the atmosphere\r\nmay take place at a considerable distance from an atmospheric storm.\r\nAs a rule, the lightning is more likely to strike some tall object,\r\nas a tree or a tower or steeple, and for this reason, and to avoid\r\ninjury from falling branches, the shelter of trees should not be sought\r\nduring thunder-storms if lightning stroke be dreaded. Ships at sea are\r\nfrequently struck by lightning, partly perhaps on account of the height\r\nof the masts and partly on account of the metal in or on them.\r\n\r\nLightning obeys the same general laws as the other forms of\r\nelectricity and naturally follows the paths of least resistance.\r\nPersons, therefore, who are in the neighborhood of or in contact\r\nwith good conductors are in more danger of injury by lightning than\r\nwhen surrounded by or in contact with poor conductors. The proximity\r\nor contact of a large metallic object exposed in a thunder-storm is\r\nconsequently more or less dangerous. On the other hand, the absence\r\nof tall objects or of specially good conductors of any kind does not\r\ninsure safety. In many cases persons in fields are struck, and cases\r\nare related of persons struck on the prairies in the West. In Fredet’s\r\ncase a shepherd was found dead in the midst of the barren moors\r\n(landes) in Southern France.\r\n\r\nMore accidents appear to occur directly to persons out-of-doors than\r\nto those in houses or other buildings. When inside buildings, persons\r\nstruck are usually near an open door or window through which the\r\nlightning enters, and they are more exposed to danger from this source\r\nif there be some metal object or good conductor in the vicinity.\r\nPersons carrying or wearing metallic objects render themselves thereby\r\nmore liable to be injured in this way.\r\n\r\nNot only does the liability to injury from lightning vary somewhat\r\naccording to the exposure or position of the person, both in relation\r\nto the free access of the atmospheric air and to the contact with or\r\nneighborhood of metallic objects or other good conductors, but also\r\nthe severity of the injuries may be largely dependent upon what they\r\nare wearing or carrying and the condition of their clothing at the\r\ntime. If the clothing be wet it will act as a good conductor, as will\r\nalso any metallic object about the person. We have already referred to\r\nthe action of metallic objects upon the passage of the electricity to\r\nand from the body and to the condition of the skin in relation thereto.\r\nThe laws of conduction and resistance are precisely the same for the\r\nelectricity of lightning as for the other forms. Hence the greater the\r\nresistance to the electricity at the points where it enters or leaves\r\nthe body, the deeper will be the burn. Thus we find not infrequently\r\nthat the lightning, in its course from the head to the feet, meets with\r\na chain or a truss, and almost invariably at least a portion of the\r\ncurrent follows this, causing a deep burn where it again passes into\r\nthe skin. All the external burns of the lightning, except the initial\r\none, are determined by the position and conditions of the body, the\r\nclothing, and the conductors near. All electricity obeys the same law\r\nand, roughly speaking, follows the path or paths of least resistance.\r\n\r\nThe clothing worn by a person when struck by lightning may be acted\r\nupon in the most various ways. Sometimes it is wholly stripped off the\r\nunfortunate sufferer, who, as in a case reported by Cook and Boulting,\r\nmay have to be protected with sacks or other hastily improvised\r\ncoverings. In a case reported by Nason, a girl of thirteen was struck\r\nwhile in the street and most of her clothes stripped off and torn to\r\nshreds, and the top of her hat, which contained steel wires, was torn\r\nfrom the brim. In the case of Wilks the body was stripped entirely\r\nnaked and absolutely nothing left on except a portion of the left arm\r\nof the man’s flannel shirt. The clothing is sometimes torn to the\r\nfinest shreds, like those of a mouse’s nest, as described by Van Horn,\r\nand in another case (Claes), where the patient was struck while on\r\nboard ship, his woollen jacket was torn into fine bits, which stuck\r\nto the ropes, and the deck was covered with fibres of wool as fine as\r\nthose of cotton-wool. In this case the woof of the trousers was said to\r\nhave been wholly destroyed, while the web was untouched.\r\n\r\nThe clothing is also often burnt. Not only are holes burnt in it as is\r\nusually the case at the point where the lightning strikes and at the\r\npoint where it leaves the body, but it may be set on fire. It may be\r\nfound smoking or in flames.\r\n\r\nOf all portions of the clothing injured, perhaps the coverings of the\r\nfeet are the most frequently so, as the electricity is very apt to\r\nleave the body through the feet, and the resistance opposed is great.\r\nHence the boot or shoe is frequently injured. Sometimes it is pierced\r\nas by a bullet, or a large hole is torn in it, or it may be torn to\r\npieces or reduced almost to lint, while the foot remains uninjured. It\r\nmay be torn, shrivelled, and burnt. In one case the soles of the shoes\r\nhad disappeared; in another the leg of the boot was clearly divided\r\nfrom the sole and both straps were torn out; while again in another the\r\nshoe was carried wholly off.\r\n\r\nThe amount of injury to the clothing does not necessarily correspond to\r\nthe amount done to the body. A person may be killed by lightning while\r\nthe clothing is uninjured. On the other hand, the clothing may be torn\r\nto pieces, carried away, or even partially burnt, while the portion of\r\nthe body underneath remains unhurt.\r\n\r\n=Symptomatology.=—The symptoms of stroke by lightning resemble, in a\r\ngeneral way, those due to high-tension currents of electricity. As in\r\nthe case of the latter, they can be divided into the direct, produced\r\nimmediately by the lightning itself, and the indirect, or secondary,\r\nproduced through the medium of other factors.\r\n\r\nIn the milder cases the person struck feels dazed and benumbed and\r\nmay or may not lose consciousness for a short time. At the moment\r\nstruck they may have the sensation of a blow, and they often see a\r\nblinding flash. On recovery of their faculties there may be a temporary\r\nanæsthesia or weakness of one or more extremities, which rarely lasts\r\nmore than twenty-four hours. There is a general shock to the system,\r\nsometimes slight loss of memory for a time, and occasionally nausea\r\nand vomiting. There are often discolorations of the skin of medium\r\nextent, and frequently burns and blisters. These persons have usually\r\nreceived the stroke on one extremity or have escaped the full force.\r\nIn the more severe cases the patient loses consciousness immediately\r\nand may continue unconscious for some hours. He passes into a condition\r\nof collapse with rapid, feeble pulse and cold extremities, and the\r\npupils are dilated. On recovery of his senses the same symptoms as in\r\nthe less severe cases, only more pronounced, are found. The loss of\r\nmemory may be marked and the intellect temporarily weakened, while the\r\nweakness and anæsthesia of the extremities persist longer. The external\r\ninjuries, burns, and wounds are liable to be more severe.\r\n\r\nIn the fatal cases where death is directly due to the electricity it is\r\nusually instantaneous or at least without recovery of consciousness. It\r\nmay be caused by shock or by apoplexy, _i.e._, intracranial hemorrhage\r\nor by the direct effect of the electricity on the brain. Of course\r\ndeath is often due to burns or to indirect traumatic injuries.\r\n\r\nThe indirect traumatic injuries caused by lightning are due either to\r\nthe loss of consciousness of the patient, which causes him to fall and\r\nthus sustain injury, or to the direct action of the electricity upon\r\nhim, knocking him down or throwing him to some distance, sometimes\r\nwith great violence, or lastly, and perhaps the most frequent cause,\r\nto the impact or pressure of objects which are torn or cast down by\r\nthe electricity and by striking or falling on a person produce great\r\ninjury. Thus persons have been killed by the fall of buildings, sheds,\r\nor trees which were struck by the lightning, or their branches. Of\r\ncourse all kinds of traumata may be produced thus.\r\n\r\nThe direct external injuries caused by lightning are burns,\r\nsubcutaneous hemorrhages, discolorations and markings of the skin\r\neither dendritic or metallic, lacerations or wounds.\r\n\r\n=Burns= occur in nearly all, perhaps all, severe cases of lightning\r\nstroke. They may be of any or all degrees, and may extend over very\r\nsmall points or over the whole or nearly the whole body. They may\r\nconsist in a simple singeing of the hair, or they may be very deep and\r\nextend to the bone. As before stated, the deep burns are found at the\r\npoints of resistance to the current, at its points of entrance and exit\r\nfrom the body, and, to a lesser degree, at all points where its course\r\nis impeded. This occurs wherever the clothes are fastened tightly or\r\npressed against the body, hence especially at the neck, waist, knees,\r\nand sometimes at the ankles. The position of the burns is determined,\r\ntherefore, by the point at which the lightning strikes the person, the\r\nposition at the moment, and by the arrangement of the dress and the\r\npresence of metallic substances. In the large majority of cases the\r\nupper portion of the body is the part first touched by the lightning,\r\nand thence it descends along the body to the ground. We are apt,\r\ntherefore, to find a severe burn about the upper portion of the body,\r\nthe head, neck, or shoulders; then a scorching, singeing, or burning,\r\nmore or less severe, in the form of a stripe or stripes more or less\r\nbroad down the body: the burns being deeper where the clothes are\r\ntighter or where metallic objects come into contact with or are near\r\nthe body; and finally a deep burn at the nearest point of contact with\r\nthe ground, usually the heel or some portion of the foot.\r\n\r\nThe burns, however, vary greatly. The eyes may be burnt and severely\r\ninjured or destroyed. The lightning has been known to enter the mouth\r\nand burn the mucous membrane within. The deeper burns not infrequently\r\nassume the form of holes. In Heusner’s cases about twenty whitish-gray\r\nspots, varying from the size of a lentil to that of a pea, were found\r\non the soles of the feet. The hair is usually singed and may be burnt\r\noff in large areas, or wholly as in a case reported by Bernard.\r\n\r\n=Wounds.=—These may be direct or indirect. We shall speak here only\r\nof the first. Like burns they occur usually at the points of greatest\r\nresistance, that is, the places of entrance and exit, but they may\r\nbe found in any part of the body. They may be clean-cut, as if made\r\nby a sharp knife, or they may be lacerated and ragged with the edges\r\ncontused or burnt. They may consist of holes which look as if they had\r\nbeen punched out.\r\n\r\n=Contusions= or ecchymoses. These may also be produced directly by the\r\nlightning, and like burns and wounds are most apt to occur where the\r\nresistance is greatest. They may be of considerable importance in a\r\nmedico-legal sense, as in Fredet’s case, where there were ecchymoses\r\non the neck similar to those produced by the fingers of a hand applied\r\nfor strangulation. In the case related by Cook and Boulting the right\r\nside of the body appeared like an exaggerated example of post-mortem\r\nstaining. There are sometimes found also dark-brown spots, small or\r\nlarge, which may be soft and, when cut, containing fluid blood, or they\r\nmay be hard and like parchment, dry, and bloodless on section.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with these are the so-called dendroid or dendritic\r\nmarks, which are dark-colored reddish bands or stripes, often more or\r\nless dichotomously branched, not disappearing under pressure, found on\r\nthe bodies of those struck by lightning. Though usually of the form\r\nmentioned, they may assume other shapes, as that of an irregular star\r\nwith zig-zag rays. Balfour has figured an excellent example of these.\r\n\r\n=Metallic staining= of the skin has been known to occur where metals\r\nwere in contact with it at the time of the lightning stroke. These\r\nstains may be permanent and are due to the introduction of the finely\r\ndivided metal. Richardson has succeeded in producing this artificially\r\nin animals. He found two conditions required, that the metallic\r\nconductor should be sufficiently fine to offer resistance to the\r\ncurrent and that the current itself should be an electric discharge of\r\nlow tension.\r\n\r\nLoss of hair is said to have occurred from lightning, though the hair\r\nwas not burnt. One case has been reported where after a severe stroke\r\nall the hair on the body is said to have fallen out.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nUnder this heading we shall consider only such symptoms as are, so far\r\nas can be ascertained, the direct result of the electricity and not\r\nthose secondary to injuries.\r\n\r\nWe will consider first those relating to the nervous system.\r\n\r\n=Loss of Consciousness.=—This occurs to a greater or less extent in\r\nall but the very mildest cases. It varies throughout all degrees from\r\na slight momentary benumbing of the faculties to the most profound\r\nstupor or coma. It may then last hours or even days. On recovery\r\nthe patient is apt to have some loss of memory, to be dazed and\r\nconfused for some time, and a certain obtuseness or blunting of the\r\nintellectual faculties may persist for a considerable period. This\r\nloss of consciousness is often accompanied by flushing of the face and\r\ndilatation of the pupils, or on the other hand the patient may present\r\nall the symptoms of collapse.\r\n\r\n=Loss of memory= in regard to the lightning stroke after recovery of\r\nconsciousness is not rare. It is frequently complete so far as any\r\nrecollection of the lightning goes, and there may be no remembrance of\r\nthe thunder-storm. Sometimes a defective memory persists together with\r\ngeneral mental impairment (James).\r\n\r\n=Mental Disease.=—A condition of mental impairment lasting at least\r\nweeks or months may occur. Mania and the delirium of terror are said to\r\nhave occurred.\r\n\r\nVarious symptoms of the disturbance of the nervous equilibrium are not\r\nuncommon. Among these we may mention tremor, insomnia, and nervous\r\ndread of thunder-storms and of electricity. There is no doubt that some\r\npersons who have been exposed to lightning stroke do, at least for a\r\ntime, become unusually susceptible to the influences of atmospheric\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n=Loss of Motion—Paralysis.=—This is a very frequent result of a\r\nstroke from lightning. Hemiplegia is not uncommon. In Bonnet’s case\r\nthe patient was struck on the head by the lightning, which caused a\r\nlacerated wound in the left temple, but did not injure the aponeurosis.\r\nOn recovery of consciousness the patient was found to have a left\r\nhemiplegia involving the face and both extremities accompanied\r\nby a diminution of sensation over the left half of the body. The\r\nsensation became normal in two days, but a partial hemiplegia remained\r\npermanently. In the case of Durand there was a nearly complete right\r\nhemiplegia with accompanying hyperæsthesia and some affection of\r\nspeech. Deglutition and mastication were difficult, and there was\r\npersistent hiccough. There was photophobia and hyperæsthesia. The\r\npatient improved in two weeks and finally recovered. There is often a\r\ntemporary hemiplegia.\r\n\r\nNearly all forms of paralyses of the extremities may occur. We may\r\nhave paralysis of all the extremities or of both arms or legs, or\r\nmonoplegias. Paraplegia occurs not very rarely. It is usually of short\r\nduration. It may be accompanied by paralysis of the bladder. Single\r\nmuscles or muscle groups only may be affected.\r\n\r\nPtosis may occur with paralysis of other branches of the third nerve,\r\ncausing diplopia. Facial paralysis occurs also alone; in one case it\r\nlasted only twenty-four hours, in another one month.\r\n\r\nDifficulty in mastication is sometimes found, but much more frequently\r\ndifficulty in deglutition is reported.\r\n\r\nRetention of urine, dysuria, or incontinentia urinæ may all occur, and\r\nthere is sometimes a paralysis of the rectum, usually temporary, and\r\nsometimes obstinate constipation, which in one case was combined with\r\nparalysis of the bladder and monoplegia.\r\n\r\nAphasia in various degrees and various forms of dysphasia or difficulty\r\nin speech are not uncommon. They are apt to be temporary.\r\n\r\nLoss of co-ordination in the lower extremities with partial paralysis\r\nof bladder and rectum is reported.\r\n\r\n=Convulsions.=—Epilepsy may be brought on by lightning: this would\r\nbe more likely to occur in a person previously subject to epileptic\r\nattacks. Hysterical convulsions and spasms may also be produced,\r\nboth immediately and as a more remote result, usually in persons\r\npredisposed. Tetany and catalepsy are said to occur.\r\n\r\nClonic spasms of the whole body and convulsive movements of the limbs\r\nare not very infrequent. In some cases a marked sensitiveness remains\r\nfor a time in the limbs struck, so that if touched they are immediately\r\nthrown into clonic spasms.\r\n\r\n=Disturbances of Sensation.=—_Pain_ occurs in nearly all cases. It is\r\nmost frequently a secondary result of the burns and other injuries.\r\nNot rarely, however, it exists as a direct symptom in the form of a\r\nburning or stinging neuralgia in the limb or limbs affected. Sometimes\r\nthe first sensation on the recovery of consciousness seems to be pain\r\nall over the body or confined to some portions only, but the amount\r\nand character of the pain, aside from that produced by the injuries,\r\nvaries much. One patient had a burning pain in the back and leg lasting\r\nonly half an hour after recovery of consciousness. In another case\r\nthere were pains all over at the end of the first week. On the whole,\r\nsevere pain in some or all of the limbs, and less commonly in the\r\nhead, without paralysis and lasting some days is not rare. In one case\r\nreported by Paige the patient had intense pain in the head, neck, arms,\r\nand chest; that in the head was constant, severe, and lasted seven\r\ndays, elsewhere less constant.\r\n\r\nPain in the arms accompanied by paralysis and anæsthesia and lasting\r\nthree months has been reported.\r\n\r\nHeadache is not rare as a later or secondary symptom.\r\n\r\nDisturbances of sensation other than pain are not rare.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of hyperæsthesia almost always exists in the portion\r\naffected immediately after the stroke. This is often so marked that\r\nit cannot be wholly due to the burns or other injuries. It is usually\r\nvery temporary and ceases in a few hours. In some cases a permanent or\r\nlasting sensitiveness to the action of electricity is said to remain.\r\n\r\nAnæsthesia, loss or diminution of sensation, occurs either with or\r\nwithout paralysis. In the cases reported by Balfour, one boy said\r\nhe could not feel his legs and another that his arms were cut off.\r\nIn a case reported by Free there was loss of sensation in the right\r\nupper extremity from the elbow to the fingers and in the left lower\r\nextremity from the knee to the toes. As a rule, the loss of sensation\r\nis temporary and quickly passes away, but it may last, in company with\r\nparalysis, for some time. In such cases either an organic lesion or a\r\ntraumatic neurosis is to be suspected.\r\n\r\nParæsthesiæ are very common after lightning stroke. Most frequent,\r\nperhaps, is the subjective sensation of numbness. Tingling,\r\nformication, and the sense of “pins and needles” may occur.\r\n\r\n_Reflexes._—As a rule, the deep reflexes seem to remain normal. The\r\nsuperficial reflexes of the parts affected are at least temporarily\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n=Special Senses.=—_Sight._—Affections of the eye. The eye and the\r\nsurrounding parts may be directly injured by burning. We also find many\r\nserious conditions caused by the lightning the pathology of which will\r\nbe considered later. When a person is first struck he may perceive a\r\nflash of light or a ball of fire before losing consciousness. While\r\nunconscious the pupils are usually dilated, but react. Sight may be at\r\nonce totally lost, but this is usually only temporary. There may be\r\namblyopia; photophobia, lachrymation, and pain are not uncommon for a\r\ntime. Cataract may be produced and other severe ocular affections may\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n_Hearing._—Sudden and total deafness may be caused by lightning, as in\r\nthe case of Cook, where perforation of both tympana was found. This may\r\nprove to be only temporary, as in the case of Nason, where the patient,\r\nthough totally deaf at first, is reported as hearing fairly on the\r\nfifth day; on the seventeenth day, however, the hearing was still dull.\r\nThe deafness may be permanent. With deafness tinnitus is apt to occur.\r\nHyperacustia, or extreme sensitiveness to noise, has also been reported\r\nin several cases.\r\n\r\n_Smell and Taste._—The person affected sometimes has noticed a smell\r\nresembling that of sulphur, and this has also been said to have been\r\napparent to others. A metallic taste in the mouth is not rare.\r\n\r\n=General Symptoms.=—When first struck by lightning and while still\r\nunconscious, the patient has usually a flushed and reddened face,\r\nwith dilated pupils. Immediately following, or perhaps without this\r\npreliminary stage, appear the symptoms of collapse. Cyanosis may occur,\r\nand the patient may appear to be asphyxiated.\r\n\r\nFever, not caused by injuries, may sometimes occur, but certainly not\r\nto any extreme degree. In many cases the temperature when taken was\r\nnormal, and even in cases of severe stroke without serious surgical\r\ninjury the temperature has not risen above 101°. In these latter cases\r\nit is hard to say how far the temperature is affected by the burns\r\nwhich are always present.\r\n\r\nThe pulse is sometimes slow, sometimes rapid and feeble, or almost\r\nimperceptible; at times it is irregular.\r\n\r\nThe respiration is apt to be labored. In Paige’s case there was marked\r\ndyspnœa. It may be almost imperceptible. It is sometimes slow and\r\nsometimes rapid.\r\n\r\nNausea and vomiting occur often after recovery of consciousness.\r\nVertigo and reeling may exist from various causes.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that seminal emissions may occur at the moment of shock.\r\n\r\nMenstruation, when present, may be checked or may continue. Pregnant\r\nwomen do not necessarily abort.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHOLOGY AND PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nA few words must be said in regard to the pathological conditions which\r\nmay be directly produced by lightning and can be detected during life.\r\nThe burns, wounds, ecchymoses, dendritic marks, and other external\r\nsigns have already been fully considered.\r\n\r\nCertain pathological changes, however, have been found in the eyes\r\nwhich are capable of being verified during life. In addition to\r\nswelling and œdema of the lids, to the injuries from burns and to the\r\nvarious paralyses of the ocular muscles, changes in the tissues of the\r\neye itself may occur. In the first place we may find corneal opacities\r\nand adhesive iritis. Iridocyclitis may occur. Cataract formation is\r\nnot rare, and its causation has given rise to many theories. Optic\r\nneuritis and neuro-retinitis are sometimes found; and we have sometimes\r\noptic atrophy. Structural changes in the choroid may also be caused\r\nby lightning. Rupture of the choroid, hemorrhage from the choroid and\r\nretina, and partial detachment of the retina may occur from the shock\r\nwithout the patient being struck by the lightning and without rupture\r\nof the external tissues.\r\n\r\n_Ears._—Perforation of the tympanum is reported in more than one case.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTOPSIES.\r\n\r\nWe shall consider here the pathological conditions found in deaths from\r\nelectricity, whether due to artificial or to atmospheric sources. The\r\nresults are or may be the same in either, so far as we now know, and it\r\nis probable that the action of the electricity is practically the same\r\nin either case, only varying as regards the strength and tension of the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\n=Rigor Mortis.=—This has generally been found in cases of death from\r\nartificial electricity. In the case of Jugigo, who was executed by\r\nelectricity, it was present four and one-half hours after death. As\r\nregards its occurrence in death by lightning and the rapidity of its\r\nonset, there has been much discussion. It is certainly present in many\r\ncases, and the probability is there is nothing diagnostic in regard to\r\nit in deaths by lightning. When absent, its absence is probably due to\r\nthe presence of some external factor and has no relation to the form of\r\ndeath. We have, on the other hand, no proof that the rapidity of its\r\nonset is increased.\r\n\r\n=Coagulation of the Blood.=—It has been observed frequently that\r\nthe blood of persons struck by lightning does not coagulate readily.\r\nSullivan states that in certain cases of complete disorganization after\r\nlightning shock the blood is left fluid and incoagulable and its color\r\nchanged to a deep black. In one of the cases of death from artificial\r\nelectricity reported by Grange, the heart was found sixty-two hours\r\nafter death to be filled with liquid blood of a rosy vermilion color,\r\nwhich quickly became darker on contact with the air. A spectroscopic\r\nexamination of the blood showed the normal lines of oxidized blood\r\nreducible by sulphydrate of ammonium. In a case reported by Matzinger\r\nthe blood as submitted was black and perfectly fluid, the corpuscles,\r\nboth red and white, were normal, and no fibrin was detected. In those\r\nexecuted by electricity the blood seems to have been fluid and not in\r\nany way remarkable.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no evidence that the bodies of those dying from\r\nelectricity in any form suffer unusually rapid decomposition.\r\n\r\nThe only absolute sign of death from electricity is decomposition of\r\nthe tissues, but the usual signs are to be relied upon to the same\r\nextent as in ordinary cases of death.\r\n\r\n=Internal Organs.=—In the cases of death from mechanical electricity\r\nno changes in the internal organs other than those due to accidental\r\ntraumata have been found, except a considerable degree of congestion\r\nand sometimes minute hemorrhages in the heart substance beneath the\r\npericardium and into the pulmonary air-vesicles and pleura. In one of\r\nGrange’s cases the heart was filled with liquid blood; in the other it\r\nwas completely empty, the right ventricle collapsed, the walls of the\r\nleft ventricle hard and contracted.\r\n\r\nCareful autopsies were made in the cases of the criminals executed by\r\nelectricity, but no important changes caused by the electric current\r\nhave been detected either macroscopically or microscopically. A few\r\npetechial spots (Tardieu’s spots) are apt to be found underneath the\r\npericardium in the heart tissue and sometimes beneath the pleura. The\r\norgans were not extremely congested. In the case of Jugigo the vessels\r\nof the spinal cord and its membranes contained if anything less blood\r\nthan usual. In this case the amount of blood found in the brain seems\r\nto have been about normal, the vessels of the dura were moderately\r\ndilated and those of the pia “in a medium state of congestion.” In the\r\ncase of Kemmler the portion of the intracranial contents underneath\r\nthe head-electrode was somewhat affected directly by the heat, the\r\nmeningeal vessels in the dura were carbonized, and the brain cortex\r\nwas sensibly hardened to one-sixth of its depth, “where there was a\r\nbroken line of vascularity.” The post-mortem temperature in this case\r\nseems to have remained unusually high, being 97° F. in the fourth\r\nventricle and 99° F. at the back of the neck three hours after death in\r\na room where the temperature was only 83°.\r\n\r\nIn autopsies after death by lightning the results are in general\r\nanalogous. The brain and its membranes may be anæmic or congested.\r\nEffusions of blood may be found beneath the dura or in the brain\r\nsubstance itself, due to the laceration or injury of vessels. Rupture\r\nof the brain is said to have occurred, and Phayre reports a case in\r\nwhich the left hemisphere was entirely destroyed and changed into a\r\ndark gray homogeneous fluid mass, only a small portion of the corpus\r\ncallosum remaining. No extravasation of blood, laceration of the\r\nvessels or membranes, or injury of the bones was detected.\r\n\r\nEcchymotic spots are frequently found beneath the serous membranes,\r\npericardium, pleura, and peritoneum.\r\n\r\nSchmitz states that parenchymatous inflammation of the internal organs\r\nmay occur, and Sullivan reports a case where the stomach was found to\r\nbe gangrenous over a large surface, the patient having lived several\r\ndays. Cases of rupture of the heart, the liver, and the spleen are\r\nreported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE MEDICO-LEGAL CONSIDERATION\r\n\r\n  OF\r\n\r\n  DEATH BY MECHANICAL SUFFOCATION\r\n\r\n  INCLUDING\r\n\r\n  HANGING AND STRANGULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n\r\n  DANIEL SMITH LAMB, A.M., M.D.,\r\n\r\n  _Pathologist Army Medical Museum, Washington, D.C._; _Professor of\r\n  Anatomy Medical Department Howard University, Washington_; _Secretary\r\n  Association of American Anatomists_; _Late Acting Assistant Surgeon\r\n  United States Army_; _President of Association of Acting Assistant\r\n  Surgeons U. S. A._; _Member of Learned Societies_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL SUFFOCATION.\r\n\r\n=Suffocation= is the name applied to both the act of and condition\r\nresulting from the deprivation of atmospheric air. If the deprivation\r\nis due to mechanical interference, the term MECHANICAL SUFFOCATION is\r\nused.\r\n\r\nMechanical interference may be by pressure upon or obstruction within\r\nsome portion of the respiratory tract. Suffocation by pressure upon\r\nthe neck is called =hanging= when the constricting force is the\r\nweight of the body itself; and =strangulation= in all other cases.\r\nGerman writers designate strangulation by cords, ropes, and the like\r\nas _Erdrosselung_, and by the hand as _Erwürgung_; French writers do\r\nnot make this distinction. In English the word throttling is probably\r\noftener applied to strangulation by the hand than by cords.\r\n\r\nThe term =suffocation= is also applied in a _special_ sense to the\r\nact and result of pressure on the mouth, nose, or chest and abdomen,\r\nstopping the breathing; or of obstruction within the respiratory tract;\r\nor of pressure upon the tract from the œsophagus, etc.; or of breathing\r\nof irrespirable gases.\r\n\r\nStrangulation is almost always homicidal, hanging almost always\r\nsuicidal, and suffocation (limited) usually accidental, but also often\r\nhomicidal.\r\n\r\nStrangulation may be admitted, therefore, as including all cases of\r\nsuffocation by pressure on the neck, whether by cords or the hand; but\r\nexcluding hanging.\r\n\r\nIt will facilitate the study of the subject if we use the word ligature\r\nas a general term to cover the many forms of cords, ropes, etc., used\r\nin strangulation and hanging.\r\n\r\nThe word GARROTING is often used to indicate the forcible compression\r\nof the neck by the hands of thieves. The assault is usually made from\r\nbehind, and the victim is robbed while the throttling proceeds. The\r\nbrevity of the process explains why death is not more frequent. The\r\nword garroting comes from the Spanish; criminal execution in Spain and\r\nItaly is usually by means of the GARROTE, a steel collar which is\r\ntightened on the neck of the condemned by a screw. The notorious thugs\r\nof the East Indies used sometimes a soft loin-cloth, at others a lasso\r\nor long thong with a running noose. In Turkey and some other Eastern\r\ncountries the bowstring is a common mode of execution.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the reported cases of strangulation and hanging\r\nshows a great variety of forms of ligature: cords, ropes, thread,\r\nthongs, lassos, flexible twigs, bamboos, leather straps, girdles,\r\nturbans, fishing-nets, collars, cravats and other forms of neckwear,\r\nbonnet strings, handkerchiefs, sheets, etc. Women have even strangled\r\nthemselves with their own hair (Case 34). Stones, sticks, coal, and\r\nother hard substances have sometimes been inserted in the ligature to\r\nincrease the pressure (Cases 36, 38, 42, 43, 44). Drunken and otherwise\r\nhelpless persons have been strangled by falling forward with the neck\r\nagainst a firm substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms and post-mortem appearances in strangulation will vary,\r\naccording as the deprivation of air is sudden or gradual, partial\r\nor complete; and whether there is coincident pressure on the great\r\narteries, veins, and nerves of the neck.\r\n\r\nThe deprivation of air disposes to asphyxia; pressure on the great\r\narteries by cutting off the supply of arterial blood to the brain\r\ndisposes to anæmia of the brain and syncope; pressure on the great\r\nveins, by preventing the return of blood to the heart, to congestion of\r\nthe brain and coma; pressure on the great nerves, the pneumogastrics,\r\nto syncope. Statistics of hanging show that in about seventy per cent\r\nof cases death is by a mixture of asphyxia and coma. While it is\r\nprobable that the proportion is less in strangulation, yet it is also\r\nprobable that a mixed result frequently occurs.\r\n\r\nAsphyxia is from _α_ priv. and _σφίξις_, pulse—absence of pulse.\r\nApnœa from _α_ priv. and _πνέω_, I breathe—absence of breathing.\r\nSyncope, _συνκοπή_, a faint; suspended animation from sudden failure of\r\nheart. Coma, _κῶμα_, deep sleep. Richardson[729] makes the following\r\ndistinction between asphyxia and apnœa: Asphyxia is difficulty of\r\ntaking in breath; apnœa is breathlessness. There is asphyxia when the\r\nblood from the heart can go to the lungs, but there is no access of\r\nair; apnœa, when there is access of air, but the blood fails to reach\r\nthe lungs. In asphyxia the lungs obstruct the circulation; in apnœa\r\nthe obstruction is in the heart. In asphyxia the air cannot reach the\r\nblood; in apnœa the blood cannot reach the air.\r\n\r\nQuinquaud[730] and Fredericq[731] conclude from experiments on\r\nanimals that asphyxia is due to the deficiency of oxygen, not to the\r\naccumulation of carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nPage[732] divides the phenomena witnessed in an animal killed by simply\r\ndepriving it of air, without interfering with the blood-vessels of the\r\nneck, into four stages:\r\n\r\nFirst. A short stage. (In the human subject this stage could scarcely\r\nlast longer than fifty seconds, which is said to be the extreme limit\r\nof the most expert divers. The breath can be held longest if a number\r\nof deep breaths have previously been taken, so as to surcharge the\r\nblood with oxygen.)\r\n\r\nSecond. The stage of “_besoin de réspirer_,” when the want of air\r\nbegins to be felt; the animal makes vigorous and violent efforts to\r\novercome the obstacle. This stage may continue for three to four\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThird. Unconsciousness supervenes with irregular and spasmodic\r\nmovements; efforts at respiration continue.\r\n\r\nFourth. Efforts at respiration cease, but the heart still beats. This\r\nstage may last from two to four minutes. Hofmann[733] says that it may\r\nlast a half-hour. In new-born infants, asphyxiated, it may be quite\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n The post-mortem appearances in such an animal were as follows: the\r\n lungs were pale, reddish, not much distended; there were a few\r\n dilated air-cells toward the anterior border; hemorrhages irregularly\r\n dispersed over the surface of the lung, varying in number and size.\r\n The right cavities of the heart contained dark fluid blood, the left\r\n were empty. The pulmonary artery and systemic veins, even the smallest\r\n branches, were gorged with dark blood. Page adds that when the great\r\n vessels of the neck are interfered with death may occur “by coma,\r\n syncope, and even asthenia.”\r\n\r\n Colin[734] made twenty-five experiments on horses, and records three\r\n of them as follows: they were all strangled with a hempen cord at the\r\n middle of the neck. The _first_ was quiet till the second or third\r\n minute, then there were violent movements and strong efforts to dilate\r\n the chest; at four minutes, spasms; four and one-half minutes, quiet;\r\n six minutes, pupils dilated, tongue hanging out, limbs flaccid; blood\r\n black. _Second horse_: Carotid artery denuded to observe its action.\r\n In fifteen seconds, blood nearly black; four and one-quarter minutes,\r\n no pulsation in carotids; five and one-half minutes, no respiratory\r\n movement; six minutes, heart-beat ceased, except feeble contraction of\r\n auricles, which continued till twenty-first minute. _Third horse_: In\r\n five minutes respiration ceased; tracheotomy performed, but there was\r\n no attempt to breathe; eight minutes, heart ceased to beat. Similar\r\n results were obtained in ruminants and in small animals, except that\r\n the larger animals lived longer than the smaller.\r\n\r\n Faure[735] made the following experiment on a large dog. He tied a\r\n cord tightly round its neck; for fifty-five seconds it was quiet, then\r\n suddenly it became agitated, threw itself against the wall, rolled on\r\n the ground, twisted itself; bloody mucus escaped from the nose and\r\n mouth; the teeth were ground together; urine and fæces were passed.\r\n The efforts at respiration became very rapid. It fell dead at the end\r\n of three and one-half minutes.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of strangulation in the human subject resemble closely\r\nthose just described as occurring in the dog.\r\n\r\nThe FIRST or PRELIMINARY STAGE lasts a variable time, according to the\r\nsuddenness and completeness with which the access of air is prevented;\r\nit lasts until there is a demand for the air. In a case of homicide,\r\ninjuries may be inflicted on the victim in this stage which may have an\r\nimportant bearing on the cause of death. Blows on the head may cause\r\nunconsciousness, or even apoplexy; upon the stomach, may cause syncope;\r\nstab-wounds may tend to cause death from hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nThe SECOND STAGE begins with the demand for air and lasts till\r\nunconsciousness supervenes. It is characterized by frantic efforts to\r\nbreathe, efforts in which the entire body takes part. If the subject is\r\nconscious, he is intensely so; the expression of the face is intense;\r\nthe eyes may protrude, the hands be clinched; the memory is unusually\r\nactive, and the events of a lifetime may rapidly pass before the mind\r\nin a few minutes. The tongue may be thrust between the clinched teeth\r\nand bitten; and urine, fæces, and semen may be discharged.\r\n\r\nThe THIRD STAGE usually appears suddenly, and is characterized by\r\nunconsciousness and irregular involuntary movements, _i.e._, spasms;\r\nthese may end in opisthotonos; the veins become turgid, and hemorrhages\r\nmay occur from the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, ears, and into the\r\nconnective tissues of the lungs, pleura, pericardium, etc. The\r\ncirculation of venous blood in the arteries is shown by the general\r\nlividity, especially where the skin is thin, as the lips and tips\r\nof fingers. Hofmann[736] states that coincident with the oncoming\r\nof unconsciousness and convulsions the respiratory effort becomes\r\nexpiratory, followed still later by inspiratory efforts.\r\n\r\nThe FOURTH STAGE begins with the cessation of spasms and of efforts to\r\nbreathe. The subject is quiet, but the heart still beats. The stage\r\nends with the cessation of the heart-beat.\r\n\r\nDischarges of semen, urine, and fæces may occur in the first and\r\nsecond stages, from terror; in the second and third from the general\r\nagitation, and in the third and fourth from paralysis.\r\n\r\nStrangulation according to Bernard[737] causes a rise in temperature,\r\nvarying from one to two degrees (Cent.). He thinks that this is due to\r\nthe changes from arterial to venous blood, especially in the muscles.\r\n\r\nLukomsky[738] concluded from experiments that in asphyxia both\r\narterial and venous pressure is increased in the systemic circulation,\r\nbut diminished in the pulmonary artery. The highest degree of blood\r\npressure coincides with the strongest respiratory movements, especially\r\nexpiration. He also concluded that the Tardieu spots (subpleural\r\necchymoses) directly depended on the efforts of breathing and blood\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nSome writers, as Taylor and Tidy, think that death occurs sooner in the\r\nhuman subject than in the lower animals; where the access of air is\r\nsuddenly and completely prevented death may be immediate. Tardieu says\r\nthat death follows pressure of the hand sooner than that of a ligature.\r\n\r\n Fleischmann[739] placed cords round his own neck between hyoid bone\r\n and chin, tied them tightly, sometimes at the side, sometimes at the\r\n back, without respiration being interfered with, because there was no\r\n pressure on the air passages. But his face grew red, eyes protruded\r\n slightly, there was a feeling of great heat in the head, of weight,\r\n commencing dizziness, and suddenly a hissing and rustling in his ears.\r\n The experiment should stop at this point. The same symptoms occurred\r\n from applying the cord over the larynx. The first experiment lasted\r\n two minutes, the second a half-minute. The difference was due to the\r\n different situation of the cord.\r\n\r\n Dr. G. M. Hammond[740] gives an account of a personal experiment in\r\n strangulation. He sat down; a towel was passed around his neck, and\r\n the ends twisted together, making forcible compression of the neck.\r\n At first he had a feeling of warmth and tingling, first in the feet,\r\n then passing over the entire body; vision partly lost; his head felt\r\n as if it would burst; there was confused roaring in ears, like the\r\n sound heard on placing the ear to a shell; he remained conscious. In\r\n one minute twenty seconds all sensibility was abolished. After a few\r\n minutes’ rest a second similar trial was made, with similar results,\r\n except that sensibility was lost in fifty-five seconds. A stab with a\r\n knife drawing the blood caused no sensation.\r\n\r\nShould the subject recover from the immediate effects of the\r\nstrangulation there may yet be serious secondary results. Among these\r\nare convulsions and paralysis; extreme swelling of face, neck, and\r\nchest; loss of voice; lesions of larynx and lungs; abscesses. Death may\r\noccur suddenly and remotely from one of the sequelæ.[741]\r\n\r\nIn the =treatment= of strangulation the first indication obviously\r\nis to remove the pressure from the neck. Artificial respiration will\r\nprobably be required, and may be aided by ammonia applied to the\r\nnostrils, tickling of the fauces, and galvanism. Colin[742] states\r\nthat artificial respiration is useless after cessation of heart-beat.\r\n(See the treatment by galvanism under “Suffocation.”) If the body is\r\ncold, artificial heat by means of hot bottles, etc. Venesection may be\r\nnecessary. Colin strongly advises venesection to relieve the distention\r\nof the heart. Stimulants and light food are often required.\r\n\r\nLimousin[743] recommends the use of oxygen. Cobos[744] experimented on\r\nanimals by injecting oxygen hypodermically, as a means of artificial\r\nrespiration. His conclusions are that the oxygen is absorbed and carbon\r\ndioxide eliminated in the same place. The oxygen thus introduced causes\r\nno trouble. Testevin[745] cures asphyxia by hypodermic injection of\r\nether.\r\n\r\nThe after-treatment will depend on the after-conditions.\r\n\r\nThe =prognosis= is good if there is no serious injury to the neck and\r\ntreatment is promptly applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.\r\n\r\nThe =post-mortem appearances= in strangulation are external and\r\ninternal.\r\n\r\nThe external appearances are of two kinds: those directly due to\r\nviolence and accident and those due to asphyxia.\r\n\r\n=External Appearances Directly Due to Violence or Accident.=—The MARKS\r\non the neck. In some fatal cases there are either no marks at all or\r\nthey are but slight; this is more likely to be the case in suicides\r\nthan homicides, and is usually due to the ligature being soft and\r\nyielding. The victim of a homicide may, however, first be stunned and\r\nafterward strangled.\r\n\r\nMarks are said to be plainer after the body has become cold and where\r\nsubjects have recovered from attempts at suicide.\r\n\r\nThe marks of the ligature in strangulation usually encircle the neck\r\nmore completely and more horizontally than in hanging. These conditions\r\nmay, however, be reversed, because a body may be dragged by the neck\r\nafter strangulation, and there have been suicides by hanging in whom\r\nthe mark of the cord was horizontal. As a rule, however, a horizontal\r\nmark with the knot on the same level as the cord, especially if below\r\nthe larynx, suggests strangulation rather than hanging; and if there\r\nare several marks the probability is even greater. In compression with\r\nthe fingers the marks are not in a horizontal but oblique line.\r\n\r\nThe mark of the ligature is usually circular, well defined, and\r\ncorresponds closely to the breadth of the ligature; rather depressed,\r\nand usually below the larynx. As a rule this depression is not deep;\r\nthe skin at the bottom of the groove is usually very pale, while the\r\nadjacent parts are red or livid. Sometimes the bottom of the groove\r\nshows ecchymoses. Neyding[746] says that suggillations in the groove\r\nmade by the ligature on the neck are rare, but are oftener found in\r\nstrangulation than hanging, because the conditions favoring their\r\nformation are oftener found in strangulation. In most cases the skin\r\nand connective tissue of the groove and of the parts in the vicinity\r\nshow, microscopically, hyperæmias and hemorrhages. Liman[747] states\r\nthat when we find suggillation in the groove or its vicinity, we may\r\nknow that some other form of violence has been applied at the same time\r\nas that of the ligature or hand. He had not seen suggillation in the\r\nfurrow either in strangulation or in hanging, except when the injured\r\npersons had lived some time, and in cases of twisting of the umbilical\r\ncord. The absence of suggillation and ecchymosis was due, he thought,\r\nto the pressure on the capillaries. Bremme[748] says that in the\r\nsubcutaneous connective tissue of the mark of the ligature there is no\r\nhemorrhage either in strangulation or hanging, if death occurs at once\r\nand the cord is removed at once after death; but if the cord remains\r\nfor some time after death there may be hemorrhage, or if death does not\r\noccur at once whether the ligature is removed or not. It is impossible\r\nto distinguish ante-mortem from post-mortem hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nThe parchment skin seen in hanging is seldom seen in strangulation.\r\nNeyding[749] says that the dryness and induration called parchment skin\r\ndepend mainly on the amount of excoriation of the skin, and this is\r\ngreater in hanging. Tardieu explains this frequency as being due to the\r\nfact that the constriction in hanging lasts a longer time. Liman has\r\nseen the parchment skin in those strangled.\r\n\r\nThe violence used may cause ecchymoses and abrasions of the skin of the\r\nneck adjacent to the mark of the ligature.\r\n\r\nThe marks of very different constricting ligatures may be quite\r\nsimilar. Taylor[750] mentions a case in which a soft silk handkerchief\r\nwas used, and the appearance was the same as that of a narrow cord, due\r\nto the tightness with which it was tied.\r\n\r\nWhere a hard substance like a piece of coal or stone is inserted into\r\nthe ligature, usually then a soft cloth, and presses directly against\r\nsome part of the neck, there is usually a corresponding bruise.\r\n\r\nMarks of pressure by the thumb and fingers are usually on the front\r\nof the neck, and either just above or below the larynx. In many cases\r\nthese marks are only those of the finger-tips with some scratches.\r\nThese marks may show definitely the probable size of the assaulting\r\nhand, and whether right or left.\r\n\r\nMarks of strangulation may disappear rapidly after the removal of the\r\nligature. Assailants usually constrict the neck much more violently\r\nthan is sufficient to cause death. Marks of violence on the neck are,\r\ntherefore, greater in strangulation than in hanging.\r\n\r\nA great variety of external injuries other than those on the neck\r\nhave been found in the different cases reported where other forms\r\nof violence were used. With few exceptions such additional injuries\r\nindicate homicide.\r\n\r\n=External Appearances Due to Asphyxia.=—A few of these have already\r\nbeen given under the caption “Symptoms.” If death occurs quickly\r\nthere may not be any signs of asphyxia. The general LIVIDITY which\r\ncomes on in the second stage usually remains after death. The face\r\nvaries in color from violet to black and may be swollen. Casper[751]\r\nsays that the face has the appearance of any other corpse. Liman[752]\r\nfound the face livid in only one of fourteen cases. Hofmann[753] says\r\nthat the cyanosis appears during the agony because of paralysis of\r\nthe circulation and gravitation of blood. The cyanosis of the face,\r\nprojection of the eyes, and congestion of the conjunctivæ are due to\r\nthe expiratory effort. These signs are also seen in fat persons who\r\ndo not die of strangulation. Tardieu[754] mentions a dotted redness\r\nor minute ecchymosis of the conjunctivæ and skin of face, neck, and\r\nchest as constant; but this cannot be considered characteristic,\r\nbecause it has been seen, though not so well marked, in death from\r\nother causes. It has been found in suffocation from compression of\r\nthe chest and belly; and also where there is respiratory interference\r\nin the prolonged efforts of tedious labor and in convulsions.\r\nLiman[755] found it in those who were hung. It is due, according to\r\nHofmann,[756] to increased blood pressure and consequent hemorrhages.\r\nIt is of importance as tending to show that there was stasis of blood\r\nin the head and face during life. Liman[757] found cyanosis in the\r\nconjunctivæ, lips, back of mouth, and in the muscles. Maschka[758]\r\nin 234 cases of asphyxia found capillary hemorrhages of the eyes and\r\neyelids 87 times.\r\n\r\nDastre and Morat[759] claim that in asphyxia the cutaneous circulation\r\nbecomes more active than in the normal state, while at the same time\r\nthe vessels of the abdominal cavity are contracted. Laffont[760]\r\nconsiders the mechanism of this peripheral dilatation.\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM STAININGS (hypostases) are usually darker in strangulation\r\nthan in other forms of death. They appear soon, as does also\r\nputrefaction, because of the quantity and fluidity of the blood.\r\n\r\nSigns of HEMORRHAGE from the nose, eyes, and mouth may be visible;\r\nas also bloody froth from the mouth and nose. Chevers[761] never saw\r\nbleeding from the ears in strangulation. Taylor[762] states that Dr.\r\nGeoghegan informed him of a case of suicidal strangulation by a ribbon;\r\nthe violence was great, there was bleeding from the ear, and the drum\r\nwas found ruptured. In this case the mark on the neck, which was deep,\r\nnearly disappeared after the ligature was removed. Taylor also says\r\nWilde, of Dublin, saw a case of rupture of drum and hemorrhage in\r\nstrangulation. Pellier[763] says that Littré mentions a case of rupture\r\nof tympanic membrane in strangulation by a cord. Zoufal and Hofmann\r\nhave offered explanations of the occurrence (Case 35).\r\n\r\nThe FACE usually shows pain and suffering; although sometimes the\r\nfeatures are calm. In the latter case there may have been syncope.\r\n\r\nThe EYES are usually staring, prominent, and congested, and the pupils\r\ndilated. Casper[764] doubts their prominence. Budin and Coyne[765]\r\nstate that in asphyxia the dilation of the pupil progresses to a\r\nmaximum and then convulsions occur. Ophthalmoscopic examination during\r\nthe dyspnœa of asphyxia shows a lessened fulness of the retinal vessels.\r\n\r\nThe TONGUE is often swollen, dark, protruding, and sometimes bitten.\r\nMaschka[766] states that if the ligature lies above the hyoid bone, the\r\ntongue will be drawn backward; if over or below the bone, the tip of\r\nthe tongue may appear more or less between the jaws.\r\n\r\nThe HANDS are usually clinched and may have in their grasp articles\r\nwhich, under the circumstances, have a medico-legal value.\r\n\r\nThe EXTERNAL GENERATIVE ORGANS are sometimes congested; erection of\r\nthe penis may have taken place and persisted. The vagina may be moist.\r\nTardieu, Devergie, and Casper[767] deny that these appearances are\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nINVOLUNTARY DISCHARGES of urine, fæces, and seminal fluid may have\r\noccurred. There is nothing characteristic in their appearance.\r\n\r\nAll the external appearances of asphyxia are usually more marked in\r\nstrangulation than in hanging.\r\n\r\n=Internal Appearances.=—THE MARK. Usually there is hemorrhage into the\r\nloose connective tissue under the mark and in the subjacent muscles;\r\nin most cases isolated and circumscribed, but sometimes extending\r\nbeyond the line of the mark. Hemorrhage from compression by the fingers\r\nis more marked than that from ligature.[768] Sometimes there is only\r\nfulness of the subcutaneous veins.\r\n\r\nThe CAROTID ARTERIES may suffer rupture of their inner and middle\r\ncoats, especially in atheromatous subjects and when the compression\r\nhas been great. Friedberg[769] states that the injury of the carotid,\r\nif there is hemorrhage into its middle and internal coats, is a proof\r\nthat the strangulation occurred during life, and probably from pressure\r\nof the fingers on the neck, without any regard to any disease of the\r\nartery. He reports two cases. The examiner should be careful not to\r\ninjure the artery with his forceps. The vessels may contain clots.\r\n\r\nThe NECK occasionally suffers extreme injury, and, owing to the\r\nviolence used, this occurs oftener in strangulation than in\r\nhanging.[770] Occasionally the neck is broken.\r\n\r\nThe HYOID bone may be fractured (see Case 5). Maschka[771] saw one case\r\nin eighteen of Erdrosselung and five cases in fifteen of Erwürgen.\r\n\r\nThe TRACHEA is sometimes torn, or may be folded on itself.\r\n\r\nThe cartilages of the LARYNX, especially if calcareous, may be\r\nfractured. This is more likely to affect the thyroid than cricoid.\r\nThe fracture would appear to occur only as the result of enormous\r\nforce; especially in the young in whom the cartilages are so elastic.\r\nThe experiments of Keiller[772] on cadavers led him to conclude that\r\nfalls on the larynx, even from a height and with superadded force, are\r\nunlikely to fracture that organ; that severe pressure or violent blows\r\nagainst the larynx from before backward may cause fracture; but that\r\nsevere lateral pressure, as in ordinary throttling, is more likely than\r\nother forms of violence to fracture the alæ of the thyroid or even the\r\ncricoid cartilages and also the hyoid bone. Taylor[773] states that Dr.\r\nInman, of Liverpool, had informed him of a case of splitting of rings\r\nof windpipe from pressure (see Cases 5, 13). Maschka[774] in fifteen\r\ncases of choking found six fractures of the larynx.\r\n\r\nChailloux[775] has collected eight cases of fracture of larynx in\r\nstrangulation. They were all made with the fingers. The experiments\r\nof Cavasse[776] seem to show that there is no great difficulty in\r\nfracturing the thyroid in strangulation.\r\n\r\n=Internal Appearances Due to Asphyxia.=—The VEINS of the entire body\r\nare distended with very dark and very fluid blood, while the arteries,\r\nespecially in the young, are mostly empty. Experiments on the lower\r\nanimals have shown that the pulmonary artery and systemic veins to the\r\nfinest ramifications are distended with dark blood.[777]\r\n\r\nTHE HEART.—The right side, especially the auricle, is usually full\r\nof dark fluid blood, due to the mechanical impediment to the passage\r\nof blood through the lungs. If the heart continues to beat after the\r\nrespiration has ceased the right ventricle is commonly well contracted,\r\nlike the left cavities, and nearly empty, the lungs being much\r\ncongested. Sometimes the left cavities of the heart contain blood. This\r\nwould be most likely to occur if the heart should stop in the diastole.\r\nSometimes clots are found in the right ventricle. Maschka[778] found\r\nclots in the heart 25 times in 234 cases of asphyxia.\r\n\r\nThe LUNGS are usually much congested, resembling red hepatization,\r\nexcept that the blood is darker. Hemorrhages (apoplexies) into the\r\nsubstance of the lungs are common. Tardieu found patches of emphysema\r\ndue to rupture of the surface air-vesicles, giving the surface of\r\nthe lung the appearance of a layer of white false membrane. Ogston\r\nadmits this occurrence in pure strangulation but to a less extent in\r\nmixed cases. Liman[779] found the lung surface uneven, bosselated,\r\nthe prominences being of a clearer color and due to emphysema.\r\nThe lungs were in the same condition of congestion and emphysema\r\nin strangulation, suffocation, and hanging. He failed to find the\r\napoplexies described.\r\n\r\nThe lungs are sometimes anæmic. In healthy young subjects, especially\r\nchildren, the blood-vessels of the lungs often empty themselves\r\nafter the heart stops. The lungs may, therefore, be bloodless, but\r\nemphysematous from the violent efforts to breathe. Page’s experiments\r\non the lower animals showed the lungs of a pale reddish color and\r\nnot much distended; a few dilated air-cells might be seen toward\r\ntheir anterior borders, and there might be small hemorrhages over the\r\nsurface. His experiments appear to show that subpleural ecchymoses\r\noccur as a result of violent and repeated efforts to breathe. Among\r\nother experiments[780] he stopped the mouth and nostrils of a young\r\ncalf long enough to excite violent efforts at respiration; it was\r\nthen instantly killed by pithing. The lungs were found pale red,\r\nnot congested, but showed subpleural ecchymoses. Page believed\r\nthese were due to the changed relation between the capacity of the\r\nthorax and volume of lungs. Liman found these ecchymoses in cases of\r\nstrangulation, hanging, drowning, poisoning, hemorrhage, and œdema of\r\nbrain, in the new-born, etc. He failed to find them in some cases of\r\nsuffocation. He believes them due to blood pressure from stasis in\r\nthe blood-vessels. Ssabinski[781] made many experiments on dogs and\r\ncats to ascertain the presence or absence of subpleural ecchymoses in\r\nstrangulation, drowning, section of pneumogastrics, opening of pleural\r\nsac, compression of chest and abdomen, closure of mouth and nose,\r\nburial in pulverulent materials, etc. Similar hemorrhages may appear\r\non the mucous and serous membranes, as the respiratory, digestive, and\r\ngenito-urinary tracts, and pleuræ, pericardium, peritoneum, membranes\r\nof brain, and the ependyma. These are sometimes minute and stellate,\r\nat others irregular in shape; many are bright-colored. According\r\nto Tardieu the punctiform ecchymoses are rarely present except in\r\nsuffocation. Maschka,[782] in 234 cases of asphyxia, found the lungs\r\ncongested 135 times, anæmic 10, and œdematous 42. He thinks the\r\nsubpleural ecchymoses valuable signs of asphyxia.\r\n\r\nThe BRONCHIAL TUBES are usually full of frothy, bloody mucus, and the\r\nmucous membrane is much congested and shows abundant ecchymoses.\r\n\r\nThe lining membrane of the LARYNX and TRACHEA is always congested and\r\nmay be livid; the tube may contain bloody froth or blood alone.\r\n\r\nTidy comparing strangulation and hanging concludes that because\r\nstrangulation is usually homicidal, and greater violence is used,\r\ntherefore the external marks are more complete in strangulation and the\r\ncongestion of the air passages is invariably much greater.\r\n\r\nMaschka found the PHARYNX cyanotic in 216 of 234 cases of asphyxia.\r\n\r\nThe other MUCOUS MEMBRANES are generally much congested. Serum is found\r\nin the serous cavities.\r\n\r\nMaschka[783] considers the rounded, pin-head ecchymoses of the inner\r\nsurface of the _scalp_ and pericranium valuable evidence of asphyxia.\r\n\r\nThe BRAIN and membranes are sometimes congested; occasionally\r\napoplectic. Maschka[784] found congestion of brain and membranes 48\r\ntimes and anæmia 30 times in 234 cases of asphyxia.\r\n\r\nThe ABDOMINAL ORGANS are generally darkly congested, although Maschka\r\ndenies this for the liver and spleen in asphyxia.\r\n\r\nThe congestion of the viscera generally is doubtless due largely to the\r\nprior congestion of lungs and engorgement of heart.\r\n\r\n Page[785] experimented on six kittens, strangling three of them by\r\n the hand, the other three by ligature. The results of the post-mortem\r\n examinations were nearly similar: the veins were full of dark fluid\r\n blood; the right cavities of the heart were similarly gorged, the left\r\n empty; lungs pale red, not congested and not distended. Brain normal.\r\n The differences were in the lungs; in the first series there were\r\n many small, irregular, circumscribed, dark-red ecchymoses scattered\r\n over the general surface; in the second, a small number of bright-red\r\n ecchymoses, somewhat larger than a large pin-head.\r\n\r\n Langreuter[786] made some experiments on a cadaver from which\r\n enough of the posterior part had been removed to enable him to\r\n view the throat. He saw that the lateral digital pressure on the\r\n larynx closed the glottis; stronger pressure made the vocal cords\r\n override each other. Similar pressure between the larynx and hyoid\r\n bone caused apposition of the ary-epiglottic folds and occlusion of\r\n the air-passages. He experimented on sixteen bodies to ascertain\r\n the effect of blows and pressure on the larynx, with the following\r\n results: In eight cases, women, the thyroid cartilage was injured\r\n three times, the cricoid four; in eight, men, the thyroid eight and\r\n cricoid five. Whence he concluded that the larynx is better protected\r\n in women. In the sixteen cases the hyoid bone was fractured ten times.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROOF OF DEATH BY STRANGULATION.\r\n\r\nTidy[787] says that “nothing short of distinct external marks would\r\njustify the medical jurist in pronouncing death to be the result\r\nof strangulation.” On the other hand, Taylor[788] considers the\r\ncondition of the lungs described as characteristic. Liman[789] did\r\nnot think there were any internal appearances which could distinguish\r\nsuffocation, strangulation, and hanging from each other.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the value of testimony it will be well to consider the\r\nfollowing facts:\r\n\r\nA victim may be strangled without distinct marks being found. The\r\npractice of the thugs shows that this may be done with a soft cloth and\r\ncarefully regulated pressure without making marks. Taylor,[790] while\r\nadmitting the possibility, states that this admission “scarcely applies\r\nto those cases which require medico-legal investigation.”\r\n\r\nThe subject while intoxicated or in an epileptic or hysterical paroxysm\r\nmay grasp his neck in gasping for air, and leave finger-marks.\r\n\r\nDifferent constricting agents may make quite similar marks. Marks may\r\nbe made on the neck within a limited time after death, similar to\r\nthose made during life. Tidy’s experiments led him to fix this limit\r\nat three hours for ecchymoses and six hours for non-ecchymosed marks.\r\nTaylor,[791] however, doubts if such marks could be made one hour\r\nafter death. He says that the period cannot be stated positively, and\r\nprobably varies according to the rapidity with which the body cools.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, unlikely in such post-mortem attempts at deception\r\nthat the other conditions usual in strangulation would be found—such\r\nas lividity and swelling of face; prominence and congestion of eyes;\r\nprotrusion of tongue; rupture of surface air-vesicles and apoplexies in\r\nthe lung; congestion of larynx and trachea, etc.\r\n\r\nNo conclusion can be drawn from the presence or absence of any single\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nA cord may be found near a body or even around its neck; there may even\r\nbe a mark around the neck. These may be attempts at deception.\r\n\r\nMarks much like those of violence may be made by tight collars and\r\nhandkerchiefs remaining until the body is cold.\r\n\r\nCases are reported of bodies having been first strangled and then\r\nburnt or hung to cover the crime; and of partial suffocation by gags,\r\nfollowed by or coincident with strangulation (see Cases 18, 20, 24).\r\n\r\nIn apoplectics with short and full neck we may find at the borders of\r\nthe folds of skin in the neck one or more depressions, red or livid,\r\nthat bear some resemblance to the marks of a ligature; but on section\r\nthere are no ecchymoses.\r\n\r\nFroth, tinged with blood, in the air-passages is considered by\r\nTardieu[792] one of the most constant signs of strangulation.\r\n\r\nThe marks of topical medical applications, as plasters, sinapisms,\r\netc., must not be confounded with marks of violence.\r\n\r\nIn strangulation by ligature the marks are usually horizontal; in\r\nhanging, oblique. In hanging too they are usually dry and parchmenty.\r\nEcchymoses are more marked in strangulation.\r\n\r\nThe dotted markings of face, neck, and conjunctivæ described by Tardieu\r\nare more characteristic of strangulation.\r\n\r\nThe principal distinctions between strangulation and suffocation would\r\nbe the absence in the latter of marks on the neck.\r\n\r\nTaylor[793] quotes the case of Marguerite Dixblanc, in which the\r\nquestion was raised whether she had strangled her mistress, Madame\r\nRiel, or whether the body had been dragged by a rope around the neck.\r\nThe question was left unsettled by the medical evidence.\r\n\r\nThe only motive for attempting to simulate strangulation on a corpse\r\nwould seem to be to inculpate an innocent person.[794]\r\n\r\nBoth suicides and murderers are usually more violent than is necessary\r\nto destroy life; murderers more than suicides.\r\n\r\nPutrefaction may cause external marks to disappear.\r\n\r\nAll marks on a body should be carefully noted; the cavities of the\r\nskull, thorax, and abdomen carefully examined; the possibility of death\r\nhaving occurred from other causes, even in strangulation, must be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nAs Taylor well says, our judgment must not be swayed to the extent of\r\nabandoning what is probable for what is merely possible.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the cord or strangulating ligature should be carefully\r\nexamined for marks of blood, for adherent hair or other substances.\r\nThe precise manner in which the cord has been tied should be noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRANGULATION: ACCIDENTAL, SUICIDAL, HOMICIDAL, SIMULATED.\r\n\r\nThe question whether a case of strangulation is accidental, suicidal,\r\nor homicidal is very difficult to answer.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL strangulation is rare. If the body has not been disturbed,\r\nthere is usually no difficulty in arriving at a conclusion; but if\r\ndisturbed a satisfactory conclusion may not be reached.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of mention that the umbilical cord may be twisted around\r\nthe neck of a new-born infant and may have caused strangulation; the\r\nmark may give the appearance of death by violence.\r\n\r\nSUICIDAL strangulation is rare. The experiments of Fleischman (_supra_)\r\nsuggest that one may commit suicide by compressing his throat with his\r\nfingers (see Case 48).\r\n\r\nWhere a ligature of any kind has been used it is important to notice\r\nthe number and position of the knots. In a general way a single knot\r\neither in front or at the back of the neck might suggest suicide; more\r\nthan one would suggest homicide. There are, however, exceptions.\r\n\r\nSuicide has been committed by mere pressure of a cord fixed at both\r\nends a short distance from the ground; by twisting a rope several times\r\naround the neck and then tying it (the coils may continue to compress\r\neven after death); by tightening the cord with a stick or other firm\r\nsubstance; by tightening the cords or knots by means of the hands or\r\nfeet or some portion of the lower limbs; by the use of a woollen garter\r\npassed twice around the neck and secured in front by two simple knots,\r\nstrongly tied one to another.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to simulate suicide; requires great skill and\r\npremeditation on the part of a murderer. “The attitude of the body,\r\nthe condition of the dress, the means of strangulation, the presence\r\nof marks of violence or of blood on the person of the deceased, on his\r\nclothes or the furniture of the room, or both, rope or ligature, are\r\ncircumstances from which, if observed at the time, important medical\r\ninferences may be drawn.” The assassin either does too little or too\r\nmuch. Taylor[795] cites a number of cases of simulation.\r\n\r\nStrangulation is generally HOMICIDAL. The marks of fingers or of a\r\nligature on the neck suggest homicide. This is true even if the mark\r\nis slight; because infants and weakly persons may be strangled by\r\nthe pressure of the hands on the throat. Even a strong man, suddenly\r\nassaulted, may lose his presence of mind and, with that, his power of\r\nresistance; with approaching insensibility his strength still further\r\ndiminishes. This is true even if his assailant is the less powerful. It\r\nrequires more address to place a ligature on the neck than to strangle\r\nwith the hand.\r\n\r\nA victim may be made insensible by drugs or blows and then strangled by\r\na small amount of compression; or suffocation by gags and strangulation\r\nmay both be attempted.\r\n\r\nThe importance of considering the position and number of the knots in a\r\ncord is mentioned under suicidal strangulation.\r\n\r\nIn homicide, in addition to the marks on the neck, there is likely to\r\nbe evidence of a struggle and marks of violence elsewhere on the body.\r\nIt is important, therefore, to notice any evidence of such a struggle.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the cord may assist in identifying the assailant.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that homicidal strangulation may be committed\r\nwithout disturbing noise even when other persons are near.\r\n\r\n =Simulation.=—False accusations of homicidal strangulation are on\r\n record. Tardieu[796] states that a distinguished young woman (for\r\n some political purpose) was found one evening at the door of her room\r\n apparently in great trouble and unable to speak. She first indicated\r\n by gestures and then by writing that she had been assaulted by a\r\n man who tried to strangle her with his hand, and also struck her\r\n twice in the breast with a dagger. She was absolutely mute—did not\r\n even attempt to speak—quite contrary to what is always observed in\r\n unfinished homicidal strangulation. On examination by Tardieu, no sign\r\n of attempt to strangle was found, and the so-called dagger-openings\r\n in her dress and corset did not correspond in position. She confessed\r\n that she had attempted deception.\r\n\r\n The celebrated Roux-Armand[797] case was another instance of\r\n attempted deception. A servant named Roux was found on the ground\r\n in the cellar of his employer Armand; his hands and legs were tied\r\n and there was a cord around his neck. He was partly asphyxiated, but\r\n after removal of the ligature from his neck he rapidly recovered,\r\n except that he was weak and voiceless. He stated by gestures that he\r\n had been struck by his employer on the back of the head with a stick\r\n and then bound as described. The next day he could speak. Armand was\r\n imprisoned. Tardieu examined carefully into the case and the results\r\n may be stated as follows: The asphyxia was incipient, else he could\r\n not have so rapidly recovered. The cord around his neck had not been\r\n tied—simply wound around several times; the mark was slight and\r\n there was no ecchymosis. Although the legs and hands were tied, the\r\n hands behind the back, there was no doubt but that Roux could and did\r\n tie them himself. He had stated that he had been eleven hours in the\r\n cellar, in the situation in which he was found. This could not be\r\n true, for a very much shorter time, an hour probably at the furthest,\r\n would have caused death, in view of the condition of asphyxia in which\r\n he was found. Again, if his limbs had been bound for so long, they\r\n would have been swollen and discolored; but they were not. Again,\r\n if the ligature had been around his neck so long as he said, the\r\n impression of it would have been more marked. Again, if his stertorous\r\n breathing had lasted long it would have been heard by neighbors. The\r\n injury on the back of the head, said to be due to a blow, was believed\r\n by Tardieu to be due to dragging him on the ground. He further\r\n had stated that when he received the blow on the head he became\r\n unconscious, and yet he also described how Armand bound him after\r\n knocking him down. Again, he had made no outcry; but if he had been\r\n strangled while partly unconscious and afterward recovered his senses,\r\n he would have been unable to give an account of the matter; if,\r\n however, he had been strangled while conscious, there was no reason\r\n why he should not have cried out. His inability to speak the first\r\n day was assumed, because what was a simulation of absolute mutism\r\n should have been simply a loss of voice. The innocence of Armand was\r\n ultimately established.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIVE CASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMICIDE.\r\n\r\n1. _Cullingworth: Lancet, May 1st, 1875, p. 608_.—Woman.

Reports by Bernard, Lacassagne, and others. Gouffé was\r\ndecoyed into a room and strangled; afterward his body was tied up,\r\nplaced in a trunk, and taken some distance away. The murderers fled\r\nto America; but eventually Bompard returned to France and Eyraud was\r\ncaptured; both confessed. When found, the body was well advanced in\r\nputrefaction; after a very careful examination was identified. He was\r\nstrangled by the pressure of fingers; the head was afterward wrapped\r\nin a cloth which was held in place by five turns of a cord around the\r\nneck; traces of the furrows made by these cords were found. Heart\r\nempty; no blood in muscles of neck; hyoid bone intact but superior\r\nthyroid cornua fractured at base.\r\n\r\n16. _Horteloup: Ann. d’Hygiène, 1873, xxxix., pp. 408-416._—Man found\r\ndead on some leaves in a fountain at bottom of staircase; skull and\r\nspine fractured. The murderers stated that they had struck him on the\r\nhead with a crutch; then, believing him to be dead, carried him and\r\nthrew him into the fountain. When examined, his face was livid, tongue\r\nbetween teeth and bitten nearly in two; and three parallel abrasions\r\non left side of neck and one on right; slight wounds about the face\r\nin addition to the fractures mentioned. No report of examination of\r\nlungs or larynx. Horteloup concluded that the man had been strangled to\r\ndeath, and that when thrown into the fountain, alighting on his head,\r\nthe jaws were brought together and tongue bitten.\r\n\r\n17. _Laennec: Journ. de med. l’ouest, 1878, xii., pp. 68-71._—Woman,\r\nage 53; attempted strangulation by her husband. There were slight\r\necchymoses on each side of neck under angle of jaw, most marked on\r\nleft side; when seen, she complained of lassitude and lively pain in\r\nhypochondria and region of lower ribs antero-laterally; no sign of\r\nlesion. She stated that she was awakened from sleep by pressure on neck\r\nand chest and feeling of suffocation; she soon lost consciousness and\r\nso remained for some hours. Her statements were corroborated by other\r\ntestimony. Laennec considered the case one of prolonged syncope from\r\npressure on carotids.\r\n\r\n18. _Lancet, ii., 1841-42, p. 129._—Woman, found dead, her clothing\r\non fire and lower part of her body burnt. Necroscopy showed face and\r\nneck swollen as low as thyroid cartilage, and purple; eyes prominent\r\nand congested; mouth closed; tongue not noticed; front of neck below\r\nswollen part showed two dark-brown hard marks and slight marks also of\r\npressure; on incision the vessels were engorged. Blood, fluid; brain,\r\ncongested. There were no vesications from the burns and no sign of\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\n19. _Alguie: “Étude méd. and exp. de l’homicide réel ou simulé par\r\nstrangulation, relativement aux attentats dont Maurice Roux a été\r\nl’objet,” Montpellier, 1864, p. 121._—This essay contains the reports\r\nof many interesting experiments on animals and the cadaver. His\r\nconclusions in this case were that the victim had first been struck on\r\nthe neck by a club; then a ligature was placed on the neck, with many\r\nturns, tied tightly, but the knots did not remain tight. [The marks\r\nwere visible four months afterward.] The assailant then tied the limbs.\r\nThe victim recovered with temporary loss of voice, memory, etc.\r\n\r\n20. _Gatscher: Mittheil. d. Wien. med. Doct. Colleg., 1878, iv., p.\r\n45._—A man found hanging. The examiner declared that he had hung\r\nhimself. Eight years afterward, suspicion of violence. A commission\r\nappointed. The protocol had shown the blood fluid; a red-brown dry\r\nfurrow around the neck; ecchymoses in connective tissues of same;\r\nthe entire back and posterior parts of limbs showed post-mortem\r\nsuggillation. The commission declared that the man had been strangled,\r\nhad lain for at least three hours on his back, and then been hung up.\r\nThe murderer confessed.\r\n\r\n21. _Ibid., p. 46._—Woman, age 50, found dead in bed. Blood fluid; two\r\necchymoses size of beans in crico-thyroid muscles of each side; patch\r\nof hepatization size of fist, in lung; injury of body. The examiner\r\ndeclared that she had been strangled by compression of larynx with two\r\nfingers, but he could not say how long the pressure had continued, that\r\nis, whether she had died of the strangulation or of the pneumonia. The\r\nassailant stated that he had choked her and when she seemed to be dead,\r\nhad left her. The woman lived alone.\r\n\r\n22. _Waidele: Memorabilien, 1873, xviii., pp. 161-167._—Husband and\r\nwife quarrelled and fought; he stated that he choked her with her\r\nneck handkerchief, and as she turned round toward him, then choked\r\nher with his hand until she died. The examiner declared that she died\r\nof asphyxia; there was a brownish-red dry streak on each side of the\r\nneck in the laryngeal region corresponding to the handkerchief, and\r\nalso two small abrasions of skin which might have been made by the\r\nhands; he concluded, however, that she had been choked to death by the\r\nhandkerchief, because there were no ecchymoses.\r\n\r\n23. _Rehm: Friedreich’s Blätter f. ger. Med., 1883, xxxiv., pp.\r\n325-332._—Woman, age 37. Choked by the hand on the neck, and at the\r\nsame time assailant’s knee pressed against her abdomen, pressing her\r\nagainst a wall, causing hemorrhage around the pancreas. Death stated as\r\ndue to asphyxia.\r\n\r\n24. _Schüppel: Vier. ger. öff. Med., xiii., 1870, pp. 140-156._—Woman,\r\njust delivered of child, and boy ten years old, were burnt to death in\r\na fire which consumed their house. Examination of the bodies showed\r\nupon the neck of the boy a groove, and his tongue protruded. The\r\nhusband was charged with murder, was imprisoned, and committed suicide.\r\n\r\n25. _Weiss: Ibid., xxvii., 1877, pp. 239-244._—Woman strangulated by\r\nthe bands of her nightcap.\r\n\r\n26. _Isnard and Dieu: Rev. cas jud., Paris, 1841, p. 101._—Man,\r\nage 65.

Question whether\r\nits death was due to asphyxia from compression of neck by the mother\r\nwith her hand to hasten delivery. He doubted the possibility of the\r\nmother thus assisting her child. But the direction of the seven\r\nexcoriations on its face contradicted the mother’s statement. The\r\ntraces of finger-nails were distinct. The lungs and alimentary canal\r\nshowed that the child had lived. Opinion given, infanticide.\r\n\r\n29. _Ibid., p. 219._—Woman, advanced in years, habits dissipated;\r\nfound strangled.

Opinion given that she had\r\nbeen struck on head, causing unconsciousness; then partly stranded and\r\npartly suffocated by pressure on neck and chest. Body afterward burnt\r\nto cover up the crime.\r\n\r\n31. _Ibid., p. 211._—Three murders by one man. All women. All injured\r\nabout the head and then strangled by both hand and ligature. Two died;\r\none had an odor of alcohol and had apparently not resisted. The third\r\nwas resuscitated. She was strong and stout, and resisted. Marks of\r\nfingers and nails on neck. Afterward she had headaches and giddiness\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUICIDE.\r\n\r\n32. _Francis: Med. Times and Gaz., December_ 2d, 1876, _p.\r\n634_.—Hindoo lunatic, a giant, strangled himself. He passed two or\r\nthree coils of stout thread around his neck, attached the ends securely\r\nto his wrists, and then extended his arms to their utmost limit. This\r\noccurred during a ten-minute absence of his attendant, who, returning,\r\nfound the man had fallen to one side from a kneeling position, with his\r\nback against a wall, quite dead. No reason to suspect homicide.\r\n\r\n33. _Badahur: Indian Med. Gaz., December, 1882, p. 330._—Hindoo\r\nwoman, age about 17, strangled herself with the border of her _saree_.\r\nNecroscopy: Circular depressed mark caused by the border of a band\r\nof cloth, which she had passed in three coils around her neck, the\r\ncoils tightly overlapping each other; the short ends had been knotted\r\ntogether with a “granny” knot at the back of the neck, like the native\r\nwomen tie up their hair. The coils were so tight that they had to be\r\ncut off. Face swollen, dark purple; conjunctivæ congested. Tongue\r\nbetween the shut teeth; bloody froth issuing from mouth and nostrils\r\n[the examination was in September, thirty hours after death]. Skin of\r\nneck reddened in nearly a continuous line all around, both above and\r\nbelow the band, about three-fourths inch wide, evidently caused by the\r\npressure of the three folds. Considerable ecchymosis above and below\r\nthe coils; the neck underneath the folds was swollen and red. Brain and\r\nmembranes much congested. Trachea, pharynx, and œsophagus congested.\r\nLungs congested. Right cavity (auricle?) of heart full, left empty.\r\nLiver, spleen, and kidneys congested. Intestinal peritoneum congested.\r\nStomach contained half-digested food. Small intestines empty; fæces in\r\nlarge intestine. Bladder empty. Uterus and appendages congested; no\r\nevidence of catamenia.\r\n\r\n34. _Harris: Ibid._—Woman; made a loop of her hair around her neck,\r\nknelt down so as to put it on the stretch; when found, was nearly dead.\r\n\r\n35. _Geoghegan: Taylor’s “Med. Jur.,” Am. Ed., 1892, p. 413._—Informed\r\nDr. Taylor of a suicidal strangulation by a ribbon. The mark on the\r\nneck nearly disappeared after removing the ligature.

Also man found dead with handkerchief tied around neck and\r\ntwisted by razor strop. Taylor considered both as suicides. Also a\r\nthird case (Amer. edit., 1880, p. 465). A man of unsound mind twisted\r\na fishing-net firmly around his neck several times; it remained secure\r\nwithout the aid of a knot.\r\n\r\n37. _Fargues: Rec. de mém. de méd., etc., Paris, 1869, xxii., pp.\r\n443, 444._—Soldier, age 32, while drunk, strangled himself with his\r\nhandkerchief, wrapping many folds around his neck, making a deep furrow\r\nwithout ecchymosis; face pale, eyes closed, lips partly closed.\r\n\r\n38. _Borchard: Jour. de méd. de Bordeaux, 1860, v., p. 349 et\r\nseq._—Collation of cases of suicide by strangulation: First, an\r\nofficer who placed his sabre scabbard under his cravat.

Jur.,” Cases 15 to 19, 59, and 62;\r\nMaschka, “Handbuch,” p. 623.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANGING.\r\n\r\nHanging is a form of mechanical suffocation by ligature of the neck,\r\nin which the constricting force is the weight of the body itself. The\r\nFrench call it “Pendaison” or “Suspension,” preferably the former; the\r\nGermans, “Erhängen.” The expression “incomplete hanging” is applied\r\nto those cases in which the subject is partially supported; kneeling,\r\nsitting, or otherwise. The same expression has also been used for cases\r\nwhich did not prove fatal.\r\n\r\nThe pathological effects of hanging are partly those of strangulation,\r\nto which must be added the effects of the weight or fall of the body,\r\nsustained as it is only by some form of ligature around the neck. These\r\nadditional injuries will, of course, be proportioned to the weight of\r\nthe body, length of rope, and suddenness of the fall.\r\n\r\n In some countries, as the United States, England, Germany, and\r\n Austria, hanging is a mode of capital punishment. It is desirable\r\n that for judicial purposes it should be divested, as far as possible,\r\n of unnecessarily cruel features; the victim should quickly be made\r\n insensible, and death be speedy. Many suggestions to this end have been\r\n made, among which is that of Haughton. He recommended that the drop be\r\n long, say ten feet, so that the cervical vertebræ may be dislocated.\r\n He also advised that the knot be placed under the chin. Others advise\r\n that it be placed under the left ear; and others yet, as Barker, of\r\n Melbourne,[798] near the spine. In any event the rope should be “freely\r\n elastic.” G. M. Hammond[799] thinks that the object in judicial hanging\r\n should be strangulation, and that the criminal should be pulled up and\r\n left to hang thirty minutes; the rope should be soft and flexible so\r\n as to closely fit the neck; a weight should be attached to the feet of\r\n persons under 150 pounds. Larimore[800] also advocates strangulation\r\n instead of attempting dislocation of the vertebræ. Porter[801] suggests\r\n that for dislocation the noose be drawn tightly around the neck at the\r\n last moment, the knot being either at one side or, still better, in\r\n front. Dislocation may be still further assured if a hollow wooden or\r\n leaden ball be placed over the knot close to the neck, thus forming a\r\n fulcrum to throw the spinal column out of the perpendicular line at the\r\n point of pressure.\r\n\r\nHanging is a common mode of suicide, especially in insane asylums and\r\nprisons. It is sometimes accidental, and rarely homicidal. It is said\r\nto have been attempted for erotic purposes.\r\n\r\nThe compression of the neck acts in line with the axis of the body;\r\nwhile in strangulation it acts perpendicularly to that axis.\r\n\r\nThe final cause of death will depend on: 1. The suddenness and\r\ncompleteness of interference with the access of air; asphyxia. 2.\r\nPressure on the large veins of the neck, preventing the return of blood\r\nfrom the head, causing congestion of brain and coma. 3. Pressure on the\r\nlarge arteries of the neck, preventing access of blood to the brain;\r\ncausing anæmia of the brain and syncope. 4. Injury to spinal cord or\r\npneumogastric nerves or all of them; causing paralysis. A combination\r\nof numbers 1 and 2 is usually found in suicidal hanging; and probably\r\nall of them in homicidal and judicial hanging. The more protected the\r\nair-passages are from pressure the greater part will coma or syncope\r\nhave in the cause of death.\r\n\r\nMackenzie,[802] as the result of examination of 130 suicidal hangings,\r\nsays that 119 died of asphyxia, 8 of asphyxia and apoplexy, 2 of\r\nsyncope, and 1 of apoplexy alone. Coutagne[803] thinks œdema of the\r\nlungs, “œdema carminé,” has an important part in causing death.\r\n\r\nThe following conditions tend to produce asphyxia: a tight ligature,\r\nor a loose ligature above the hyoid bone. To produce coma, a loose\r\nligature pressing against the hyoid bone or larynx, especially a\r\ncretified larynx. To both asphyxia and congestion of brain, a ligature\r\njust beneath the lower jaw, or around lower part of neck.\r\n\r\nHofmann[804] states that when the ligature is placed between the larynx\r\nand hyoid bone, the base of the tongue is pushed upward against the\r\nposterior wall of the pharynx, completely stopping respiration and\r\ncausing asphyxia. Taylor[805] states that if the rope presses on or\r\nabove the larynx, the air-passages are _not_ so completely closed as\r\nwhen pressure is below the larynx. In the latter case death would be\r\nimmediate; in the former a slight amount of respiration might continue.\r\nThe instantaneous loss of consciousness is due, not to asphyxia alone,\r\nbut to compression of the large vessels, especially the carotids,\r\nagainst the transverse processes of the vertebræ, causing rupture of\r\nthe middle and inner coats, and at the same time compression of the\r\njugular veins and pneumogastric nerves. Immediate unconsciousness will\r\nalmost certainly follow compression of the pneumogastrics. He also\r\nbelieves that the loss of consciousness and of power of self-help\r\noccur at the moment that the noose is tightened around the neck. There\r\nis no record of any one who attempted suicide by hanging seeking to\r\nrecover himself, although no doubt some would have done so if the\r\nspeedy unconsciousness had not prevented. Hofmann mentions the case of\r\na man who was found hanging, and with a loaded revolver in his hand,\r\napparently having intended to shoot as well as hang himself, but lost\r\nconsciousness before he had time to discharge the revolver. According\r\nto him the causes of death are three: occlusion of the air-passages,\r\ninterruption of passage of blood to brain, and compression of\r\npneumogastric nerves.\r\n\r\nVon Buhl[806] experimented on cadavers and concluded that in hanging,\r\nthe epiglottis and arytenoids are pressed over the glottis, and the\r\ntongue and the œsophagus against the vertebræ, causing death by\r\napnœa. When the trachea was isolated from the vessels and tied, the\r\nair-passages below became dilated and the lungs emphysematous and\r\nanæmic. The heart continued to beat and blood to circulate.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral arteries being much smaller than the carotids, the\r\ncirculatory disturbance in the brain is not adjusted with sufficient\r\npromptness. Compression of the pneumogastrics, according to\r\nWaller,[807] has caused subjects to fall to the ground as if struck by\r\nlightning. He holds that the unconsciousness in hanging is the result\r\nof the compression of the pneumogastric nerves and not of the arteries.\r\nThanhöfer[808] knew a student who had acquired a certain dexterity in\r\ncompressing these nerves. One day he compressed the two nerves, his\r\npulse stopped and he became unconscious. Thanhöfer[809] tried bilateral\r\ncompression of pneumogastrics in a young man sentenced to be executed.\r\nThe pulse fell at once and the heart soon stopped; the eyes were fixed\r\nand glassy. It was some time before he regained consciousness and for\r\ntwo days there was _malaise_.\r\n\r\nHofmann says that the compression irritates and, in a higher degree,\r\nparalyzes the pneumogastric nerves and causes disturbance of the action\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\nFaure[810] denies that the constriction of the vessels of the neck has\r\nany effect in the production of symptoms[811].\r\n\r\n Coutagne believes that the pressure on the pneumogastric nerve is a\r\n factor in causing death. He hung two dogs; in one the pneumogastric\r\n nerves were dissected out and placed in front of the ligature; this\r\n dog (No. 1) lived a quarter of an hour and died of pure asphyxia with\r\n efforts at inspiration continued to the end. The other dog (No. 2),\r\n in which the nerves were compressed, died in five minutes. In both,\r\n the abdominal organs were congested and the cavities of the heart\r\n were full. The lungs of the first were dry and uniformly red; of the\r\n second were resisting, crepitant, and quite œdematous. No subpleural\r\n ecchymoses in either. The experiments on animals by Corin[812] led\r\n him to conclude that pressure on the pneumogastrics caused increased\r\n frequency of the heart-beat and slowing of respiration. Pellier[813]\r\n considers the subject quite fully. It would appear that the pressure\r\n on the pneumogastrics disposes to stop the action of the heart and\r\n cause rapid, perhaps instant death. The pressure on the carotids\r\n causes cerebral anæmia and is then only a secondary cause. Levy[814]\r\n does not think the action of the pneumogastrics is sufficiently well\r\n known.\r\n\r\nTidy states that a dog lived for three hours suspended by a rope placed\r\nabove an opening in the windpipe; and that Smith[815] mentions the case\r\nof a criminal who was hung; Chovet tried to save the man by making an\r\nopening in the trachea before the execution and introducing a small\r\ntube. The man was alive forty-five minutes after the drop, but could\r\nnot be resuscitated, although the surgeon bled him.\r\n\r\nIn a small proportion of cases of hanging, homicidal and judicial,\r\ndeath occurs by dislocation of the spine. This is said to have been\r\nfirst noticed by the celebrated Louis, who states that the Paris\r\nexecutioner was in the habit of giving a violent rotary movement to\r\nthe body of the convict as the trap was sprung, causing a dislocation\r\nof the odontoid process and compression of the cord and almost instant\r\ndeath. Taylor[816] says that for dislocation the body must be heavy and\r\nthe fall long and sudden. Devergie[817] found this to occur in about\r\ntwo per cent of cases. It is said that the Paris hangman placed the\r\nslip-knot under the chin in front, which is as Dr. Haughton suggests.\r\n\r\nDeath may occur from secondary causes after apparent recovery; from\r\ncongestion of brain and other lesions of the nervous system; these may\r\nprove fatal at remote periods.\r\n\r\nFracture of the odontoid process according to M. de Fosse is more\r\ncommon than dislocation, and the giving away of the intervertebral\r\nsubstance more likely than either of the others. The phrenic and\r\nother respiratory nerves are likely to be paralyzed; the vertebral and\r\ncarotid arteries may be ruptured. The medulla oblongata is also likely\r\nto be fatally injured. Death may also occur from hemorrhage upon the\r\ncord, causing pressure.\r\n\r\nBesides the ropes used as ligatures in judicial hanging, almost every\r\nconceivable article that could be made into the semblance of a cord has\r\nbeen used by suicides; usually, however, some portion of the bedding\r\nor clothing. When one resolves on suicide, all the precautions of the\r\nmanagers of prisons and asylums fail to prevent.\r\n\r\nThe secondary effects in those who recover involve the respiratory\r\norgans—dyspnœa, cough, bloody sputa, bronchial râles, and fever;\r\nor the nervous system—aphonia, dysphagia, numbness, chilliness,\r\nspasms, pains in neck, face, or shoulder; sometimes paralysis of\r\nbladder and rectum, and loss of memory. The marks on the neck slowly\r\ndisappear.[818] Verse[819] collated a number of cases in which the\r\nhanging was not completed and the subjects lived for varying periods\r\nafterward. Wagner and Möbius[820] discuss the spasmodic seizures and\r\namnesia, which often appear after the restoration from hanging.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS IN HANGING.\r\n\r\nObviously these will be in some respects identical with those of\r\nstrangulation. In considering the latter, some of the similarities\r\nand dissimilarities of symptoms and post-mortem appearances of\r\nstrangulation and hanging were mentioned.\r\n\r\nDeath may be immediate and without symptoms.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, no preliminary or “waiting” stage, as in\r\nstrangulation, except in those rare cases of suicide where the subject\r\ninclines his body forward with his neck against the ligature, his\r\nbody being near the floor or ground. The absence of a drop makes this\r\ncondition very similar to ordinary strangulation. The body of a victim\r\nof homicide might be similarly placed for the purpose of deception, and\r\nalso that of a subject previously made unconscious; in these cases the\r\nsymptoms and appearances would resemble those of strangulation.\r\n\r\nIn other words it is necessary that there should be a drop or fall,\r\nor at least the weight of the body, to produce the characteristics of\r\nhanging. The jerk of the fall or sudden dependence of the body upon\r\nthe ligature causes a much greater constriction of the ligature on the\r\nneck, and in a different direction, than in strangulation; and also a\r\nmuch greater pressure on the blood-vessels and nerves of the neck.\r\n\r\nTidy divides hanging into three stages:\r\n\r\nFirst stage: Partial stupor lasting thirty seconds to three minutes,\r\naccording to the length of the drop, the weight of the body, and\r\ntightness of the constriction. The testimony seems to be uniform that\r\nthere is no pain in this stage; indeed, that the feeling is rather one\r\nof pleasure.[821] The subjective symptoms described are an intense heat\r\nin the head, brilliant flashes of light in the eyes, deafening sounds\r\nin the ears, and a heavy numb feeling in the lungs. Sometimes there\r\nis a feeling of absence of weight. In many cases efforts to breathe\r\nare made for a time after the air-passages are closed. It is doubtful\r\nwhether there are any voluptuous feelings, as has been suggested.\r\n\r\n Chowne[822] reports the case of Hornshawor, “Monsieur Gouffé,” who was\r\n in the habit of hanging himself for exhibition. He fixed the noose\r\n with a knot that would not slip, sprang into it, the rope coming\r\n behind the lower jaw and the two sides passing up behind the ears.\r\n He would hang for ten to fifteen minutes, and in addition to his own\r\n weight would sustain one hundred and fifty pounds. Three times the\r\n rope slipped and he would have died but for the help of spectators. He\r\n described his sensations as follows: He lost his senses all at once.\r\n The instant the rope got in the wrong place he felt as if he could not\r\n get his breath, as if some great weight was at his feet; and could not\r\n move only to draw himself up; felt as if he wanted to loosen himself\r\n but never thought of his hands. He said: “You cannot move your arms or\r\n legs to save yourself; you cannot raise your arms; you cannot think.”\r\n\r\n Taylor[823] mentions the case of Scott, the American diver, who was\r\n in the habit of making public exhibitions of hanging. The last time\r\n he hung for thirteen minutes, the spectators not suspecting that he\r\n had died. It is supposed that the ligature had slipped. Taylor also\r\n reports a case (from Dr. Elliott) of a boy, age 11, who, to frighten\r\n his parents, tied a knot in a handkerchief and put it around a knob\r\n and his neck in one continuous ligature. The pressure against the\r\n trachea was so effective that he became unconscious and died before\r\n he could relieve himself.\r\n\r\nSecond stage: The subject is unconscious and convulsions usually\r\noccur. The convulsed face, however, is a part of the general agitation\r\nand does not indicate pain. In judicial cases the face is covered\r\nwith a cap. Sometimes there are no spasms. Urine, fæces, and semen\r\nmay be discharged in any stage. Jaquemin, however, in forty-one\r\ncases of hanging, noted discharge of urine and fæces only twice.\r\nSemen has, however, been found in the urethra where none was ejected\r\nexternally.[824]\r\n\r\nThird stage: All is quiet except the beating of the heart. As a rule,\r\nthe pulse may be felt for ten minutes.\r\n\r\n Blankenship[825] reports an execution of a man by hanging. After\r\n the rope was adjusted the pulse was 121; first minute after drop,\r\n pulse 54; second minute 52; third 39; fourth 20; fifth 0; sixth 70;\r\n seventh 73; eighth 0; ninth 34; not perceptible afterward. Died\r\n from strangulation; neck not dislocated. The heart beat once in the\r\n nineteenth minute; from the ninth to the nineteenth, only two or three\r\n times. No priapism.\r\n\r\nIn judicial executions, however, the right auricle is found in action\r\nwhen the subject is taken down at the end of the usual period of\r\nsuspension (see Case 89). Tardieu mentions a case where the heart\r\nwas beating 80 to the minute one and one-half hours after supposed\r\ndeath. It is probable that in these cases the deprivation of air and\r\ncompression of the vessels has not been complete. In such cases life\r\nmay sometimes be restored. Cases are reported where restoration has\r\nbeen possible within a period of a half-hour of suspension; although\r\nthe fatal period is usually five to eight minutes at most. If, however,\r\nthe tissues and especially the spinal cord are injured, or the ligature\r\nhas compressed below the larynx, the chance of recovery is very small,\r\neven if the body is cut down at once. According to Faure, animals\r\nexperimented upon die in twelve to twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nMany cases of “incomplete” hanging have been reported; where the feet\r\ntouch the floor, or would do so if the subject should choose to have it\r\nso. Tardieu[826] collected 261 cases, in 168 of which the feet touched\r\nthe ground, in 42 the subject was on his knees, in 29 the body was\r\nlying, in 29 sitting and in 3 squatting. Hackel,[827] in 67 cases of\r\nhanging, found it incomplete in 34 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—Suicide of Prince Condé. (See page 763.)]\r\n\r\n In one of the experiments of Faure[828] a large dog was hung, his feet\r\n touching the ground. For five minutes he was quiet, breathing without\r\n difficulty. He then tried to release himself, but instead tightened\r\n the knot; he made still greater efforts to release himself, became\r\n comatose and fell, apparently dead, at the end of ten minutes; was\r\n really dead in twenty-eight minutes.\r\n\r\nIn incomplete hanging the upper limbs may have any position; the lower\r\nlimbs are disposed according to the position of the body (Cases 1, 10,\r\n18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 37, 43, 50, 56).\r\n\r\n Faure[829] made many observations on dogs which he killed by hanging.\r\n He describes the results as follows: The dog remains quiet usually\r\n twenty to thirty seconds, sometimes eight to ten minutes; then becomes\r\n violently agitated, the body being thrown forward and backward so\r\n powerfully that it bounds to a great height; the head is in motion;\r\n the jaws parted; the feet extended and flexed; sometimes brought up\r\n to the mouth and neck, trying to remove the obstruction; the inside\r\n of the mouth is violet-colored; tongue blackish, livid, may be\r\n bitten, often falls backward; the teeth are ground together; the eyes\r\n sometimes protrude; conjunctivæ congested; urine and fæces discharged.\r\n The agitation lasts two to five minutes, and then the dog gradually\r\n becomes quiet. Toward death, however, the agitation is renewed but in\r\n a different way; the fore feet are raised and put forward, the tongue\r\n often has a peculiar spasm, the chest is raised, the eyes drawn back\r\n into the orbits, pupils contracted; all of this is over within two\r\n seconds. Such paroxysms may be repeated half a dozen times. In dying,\r\n the eye oscillates from side to side and the pupil dilates. The heart\r\n beats some time longer.\r\n\r\n Francis Bacon records that he knew a man who wanted to find out by\r\n experience if there was any suffering in hanging. He placed the cord\r\n around his neck and stepped off a bench, intending to step back again,\r\n but became immediately unconscious and would have died but for the\r\n opportune arrival of a friend. He said he saw a light before his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe first indications obviously are to let the subject down, and remove\r\nall constriction of neck and chest. Artificial respiration should then\r\nbe used, and this may be assisted by the vapor of ammonia to the nose\r\nand tickling the fauces. If the body is warm, cold affusions may be\r\napplied to the head and chest, and galvanism may be used.\r\n\r\nIf the body is cold, apply warmth. Friction of the limbs aids in\r\nrestoring warmth. If the subject can swallow give stimulants; these may\r\nalso be used by rectum. Venesection may be required to relieve cerebral\r\ncongestion or distention of the right heart and pulmonary circulation.\r\n\r\n The following cases illustrate what may be done to resuscitate one\r\n who has been hanged: A man, age 35, in good health, weight one\r\n hundred and sixty pounds, was executed with a drop of over six feet;\r\n the rope slipped behind the mastoid process. After three minutes\r\n his struggles ceased; the radial beat ceased at six and one-half\r\n minutes; all signs of life at ten and one-half minutes, and the body\r\n was blue. Fourteen and one-half minutes, body let down; mark about\r\n one-fourth inch deep on neck; swelling above and below; no fracture\r\n of vertebræ. Strong galvanism of the pneumogastrics after sixteen\r\n or seventeen minutes at intervals of four seconds caused marked\r\n respiratory efforts; sixty-six minutes, galvanism renewed; heart-beat\r\n and radial pulse recognized; epiglottis swollen, requiring the tongue\r\n to be drawn forward; a few ounces of blood removed; pupils contracted.\r\n One hundred and four minutes, galvanism renewed; subject swallowed\r\n a little brandy-and-water. One hundred and thirteen minutes, slight\r\n muscular action; cornea sensible. One hundred and eighty-six minutes,\r\n feet warm, carotid pulsation. Signs of life now increased till six\r\n hours after drop, when pupils began to dilate again. Twelve to fifteen\r\n ounces of blood were taken and pupils again contracted and pulse\r\n beat strong and steady; breathing easy, more regular; eyes followed\r\n movements of persons around the room. Died nine hours later, fifteen\r\n hours after drop. The experiments were repeatedly interrupted by the\r\n sheriff.[830] Taylor[831] reports a case of recovery. Woman, age 44;\r\n found hanging from a clothes-line, thrown over a door and fastened to\r\n a handle on the other side; her knees on the floor; white froth around\r\n the mouth; tongue protruding and swollen; face dusky and swollen; lips\r\n dark blue; brown parchment mark on neck; skin abraded over larynx;\r\n conjunctiva insensible; pupils dilated and fixed; fingers clinched;\r\n limbs flaccid; no reaction from tickling feet; no respiration; faint\r\n heart-beat and fine thready pulse. Sylvester’s artificial respiration\r\n method used at once and continued for four and one-half hours; tongue\r\n held forward by forceps. One hundred and fifteen minutes after body\r\n was first seen there was spontaneous movement of legs. One hundred and\r\n forty-five minutes, conjunctivæ sensible. One hundred and seventy-five\r\n minutes, retching. Two hundred and five minutes, free vomiting. She\r\n recovered but remembered nothing of the hanging. Keen[832] reports the\r\n results of experiments upon a criminal who was executed by hanging.\r\n He was cut down about half an hour after the drop. Faradization\r\n and galvanization of pneumogastric and recurrent laryngeal nerves\r\n caused movements of left vocal cord, but not the right; there was no\r\n reflex motion in the larynx. The left phrenic nerve made no response\r\n to stimulus. The internal intercostal nerves caused the raising of\r\n the cartilage below them (inspiratory), the external intercostals\r\n depressed the upper seven ribs (expiratory), and raised the eighth.\r\n The other four not examined. The muscles of the face retained their\r\n contractility.\r\n\r\nVery few, comparatively, however, have been restored after hanging. For\r\ncases of recovery see _Medical Times and Gazette_, London, 1871,\r\nVol. I., p. 669 (Cases 12, 13, 42, 44, 47, 49, 66).\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.\r\n\r\nThe post-mortem appearances are external and internal.\r\n\r\nThe =external= appearances are those due to the action of the ligature\r\non the neck and to other violence, if any has been done, and those due\r\nto asphyxia or syncope.\r\n\r\nThe MARKS of the ligature. If the suspension be very brief and the\r\nligature soft and supple, and the body instantly cut down after death,\r\nthere may be no mark. Allison[833] questions the value of the mark,\r\ncontending that it is post mortem, and reports cases; says it is\r\npresent only if the drop be considerable or the suspension continue\r\nafter death. Tidy says that the mark is, in a measure, independent of\r\nthe ligature and duration of suspension, and does not usually acquire\r\nits color for some hours after death; sometimes, however, it has\r\noccurred in a much shorter time. It may be slight because the ligature\r\nhas been placed over the clothing. The longer a body hangs after death,\r\nthe more the mark shows. It can be produced upon the cadaver.\r\n\r\nHarvey[834] says: “The characteristic mark is sometimes found in\r\nnon-fatal cases.... In eight instances in the present returns (of\r\nnearly 1,500 cases of hanging) there was a distinct mark.”\r\n\r\n Coutagne,[835] in twenty-four necroscopies on subjects hung, found\r\n only slight or doubtful lesions in five cases; but of these, one\r\n was in a condition of advanced putrefaction, another was apparently\r\n weakened by loss of blood from wounds, and in the other three there\r\n were marks of violence. In seventeen cases the lesions of the neck\r\n were plain; hemorrhage in connective tissue or muscle.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the mark is usually oblique, following the line of\r\nthe lower jaw upward and backward behind the mastoid processes; it\r\nmay, however, be horizontal. If the ligature encircles the neck more\r\nthan once, one mark may be circular, the other oblique. If a running\r\nnoose is used the mark may be circular, and be seen all the way around\r\nthe neck, looking like the mark of a strangulation. Taylor[836] states\r\nthat if the noose should be in front, the mark may be circular, the\r\njaw preventing the ligature from rising upward in front as much as it\r\ndoes behind. If it encircles the neck but once, its continuity is apt\r\nto be broken by the prominence of the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage,\r\nsterno-mastoid muscles, etc.\r\n\r\nIn four-fifths of the cases (117 out of 143, Tardieu) the mark is found\r\nbetween the chin and larynx; in nearly all the remaining fifth, over\r\nthe larynx; in a very few below the larynx; the last position is due\r\nto the protection of the neck by a handkerchief or beard, or where\r\nthere is some anatomical or pathological peculiarity which prevents the\r\nligature from going higher.\r\n\r\n Hofmann[837] had seen two cases of tumor of neck; one in a woman,\r\n where the cord was below the larynx; and in a man where it was over\r\n the larynx. He quotes[838] as follows: Remer, above larynx, 38;\r\n over larynx, 7; below larynx, 2. Devergie, above larynx, 20; over\r\n larynx, 7; below larynx, 1. Casper, above larynx, 59; over larynx, 9.\r\n Roth[839] in 49 cases found the ligature mark above the hyoid bone\r\n in 5; between the bone and the larynx, 31; over the larynx, 8; below\r\n the larynx, 1. Hackel found the ligature in forty per cent of cases\r\n between hyoid bone and larynx; in sixty per cent lower down. The\r\n ligature always appears lower after the body is laid down than it was\r\n in suspension. Maschka found the furrow 147 times in 153 cases above\r\n the larynx.\r\n\r\nThe mark will vary in character according to the kind of ligature used,\r\nits mode of application, the vitality of the tissues, and the period\r\nthat has elapsed since death. The result is different according as the\r\nknot or loop is single or double, a running or slip knot.\r\n\r\nThe mark may differ in character in one part of the neck from another.\r\nThe same furrow may be soft in one part and dry in another. The width\r\nof the mark does not necessarily correspond to the diameter of the\r\nligature. A double mark usually means that the ligature has been twice\r\npassed around the neck, although the marks may not be continuous or\r\nparallel. Tardieu states that a large single leather thong pressing\r\non the neck only by its borders may make a double mark. The mark is\r\nusually _depressed_. The depth of the depression, groove, or furrow,\r\nas it is called, is greater the narrower and firmer the ligature, the\r\nlonger the suspension, and the greater the weight of the body. The\r\nmark may be merely a slight depression, without color, or only a red\r\nblush, if the subject is young, tissues healthy, and suspension brief.\r\nRoth,[840] in 49 cases of hanging, found the furrow of the ligature was\r\nbrown in 40, red-brown in 6, and 3 times bluish.\r\n\r\nIn about two-thirds of the cases the bottom of the furrow, the\r\nplace of greatest pressure, is white, especially so where the knot\r\nis tied; while the edges of the furrow are usually slightly raised\r\nand red or livid. If the subject is very fat, there may be only a\r\nslight depression. Harvey[841] says that this hard, white, shining,\r\ntranslucent band from compression of the connective tissue is the first\r\nstage of the parchment or vellum skin, and is chiefly noticed in fresh\r\nbodies. The borders are swollen and œdematous, called by Lacassagne\r\n“_bourrelet de sillon_.”\r\n\r\nThe skin beyond the furrow is usually violet. Authors differ as to\r\nwhether this is due to congestion or hemorrhage. Roth[842] in 49 cases\r\nfound swelling below the furrow 27 times. Hackel found ecchymoses above\r\nthe mark in thirty-five per cent of the cases of hanging. Hofmann\r\nthinks that the lividity of the upper border of the furrow is due to\r\nthe stopping of the venous blood descending from the head.\r\n\r\nThe dry, hard, yellowish-brown, or reddish-brown “parchment” furrow,\r\ndescribed by writers, is said to be common. Ogston[843] found it in\r\none-third of his cases. It is found only when the body has remained\r\nsuspended for several hours after death; indeed, may be produced by\r\napplying the ligature to the cadaver; is not at all, therefore, a proof\r\nof suspension during life. Liman states that constriction by a ligature\r\neven for some time does not necessarily cause a mummified or excoriated\r\nfurrow. He saw cases in which the mark was soft, flat, scarcely\r\ncolored, but little interrupted, and not parchmenty. The parchment skin\r\nseems to depend very much upon a previous excoriation of the skin. Its\r\nappearance can be prevented or delayed by examining a body soon after\r\ndeath or by rehanging it; and after it has appeared it will disappear\r\non the application of some liquid. Taylor[844] compares this parchment\r\nmark to the cutis from which the cuticle has been removed for two or\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\nSlight abrasions and ecchymoses are sometimes found in the furrow.\r\nEcchymoses alone do not indicate whether suspension has been before or\r\nafter death; but abrasions with hemorrhage strongly suggest suspension\r\nduring life. Devergie regards ecchymoses of the neck as strongly\r\nsuggestive of homicide. Neyding[845] says that suggillation in the\r\ngroove is oftener found in strangulation than hanging. And Bremme[846]\r\nthat there is no hemorrhage in the subcutaneous tissue of the mark if\r\ndeath occurs at once and the cord is removed at once after death; but\r\nif the cord remains for some time after death there may be hemorrhage,\r\nor if death does not occur at once, whether the ligature be removed or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nRoth[847] found ecchymoses or small bladders at the lower margin of\r\nthe furrow, 9 times in 49 cases. Riechke found only once in 30 cases a\r\nhemorrhage beneath and on both sides of the mark. Chevers did not find\r\necchymoses of the skin of the mark in cases of hanging. Casper found no\r\necchymoses in 50 of 71 cases. Maschka has seen two cases where burns on\r\nthe neck resembled mark of ligature.\r\n\r\nThe furrow, when once distinct, remains constant for a long time after\r\ndeath, even in putrefaction. Marks from soft substances, however,\r\ndisappear sooner than those from strong and uniform compression.\r\n\r\nThe NECK nearly always appears stretched. According to Roth the\r\nmobility of the head is increased by this stretching. The HEAD is\r\nalways inclined to the opposite side to that of the knot. In suicides\r\nthe head is usually bent forward on the chest. The HANDS are often\r\nclinched so tightly that the nails are driven into the palms. This\r\noccurs more especially when the hanging has been done with violence.\r\nWhen the feet touch the ground, as often occurs in suicide, the hands\r\nmay be stretched out. Roth found the hands and feet flexed in 44 of 49\r\ncases. Taylor says that we may expect to find the hands clinched when\r\nconstriction of the neck is sudden and violent. The LEGS are usually\r\nlivid.\r\n\r\nThe FACE varies with the duration of the suspension; at first it is\r\npale, afterward livid; congested and swollen, if the subject has been\r\nlong suspended. Roth found the face pale in 43 of 49 cases. In about\r\none-half the cases the features are calm and placid (syncope). Maschka\r\nfound the lips bluish in 98 of 153 cases. The EYES are often prominent,\r\nstaring, and congested, and usually the pupils are dilated. Lacassagne\r\nand Maschka[848] look upon ecchymoses of the eyelids and conjunctivæ,\r\n“_piqueté scarlatin_,” as important as favoring the idea of hanging\r\nor strangulation. Roth found in 49 cases the eyelids closed 28 times;\r\nhalf open, 12; congested in 6; ecchymosed in 2. Pupils dilated in 31;\r\nnarrowed in 2. Dilated in 97½ per cent of Ogston’s cases (Cases 85,\r\n86; rupture of crystalline lens). Harvey[849] says the blood was found\r\nflowing from the EAR in 6 cases of nearly 1,500, but no details were\r\ngiven. Ogston, one case. Hofmann saw a case in which there was bleeding\r\nfrom the ears. He says this is not due, as has been supposed, to\r\nrupture of the tympanic membrane, but to hemorrhage from subcutaneous\r\nvessels (Case 27).\r\n\r\nThe TONGUE is usually livid and swollen, especially at the base.\r\nAccording to Tidy, Dr. Guy looks on this as showing that suspension\r\ntook place very probably during life. In about one-third of the cases\r\nthe tongue is protruded and compressed between the teeth; sometimes\r\nbitten. Some observers found it protruded only as a result of\r\nputrefaction. The protrusion of the tongue is not believed to depend\r\non the position of the ligature. Hackel in 67 cases found the tongue\r\nlying forward in all cases where the cord was between the larynx and\r\nthe hyoid; in 55 per cent in front of the teeth, in 18 per cent between\r\nthe teeth; where the ligature was lower down, the tongue was behind\r\nthe teeth. He found by experiment that in the spasmodic expiratory\r\neffort the tongue was thrust forward; in the inspiratory movement,\r\ndrawn backward. He concluded that the forward movement was the result\r\nof reflex action. Maschka[850] found the tongue between the teeth 58\r\ntimes in 149 cases. Roth in 49 cases found the tongue projecting and\r\nbitten in 22, the teeth shut in 15 others; in 15 the mouth was open;\r\nthe tongue was retracted in 30 cases.\r\n\r\n Harvey, after examining reports of nearly fifteen hundred hangings,\r\n says: “In the majority of instances immediately after death the\r\n features were placid, the face pale, the eyes not unduly prominent,\r\n the mouth closed or half open, the tongue pressed against the teeth\r\n but not protruding; the superficial veins full, but the head, neck,\r\n and trunk free from lividity. After a longer or shorter time, however,\r\n and apparently after a very few hours, in India, all this is changed.\r\n Livid patches appear about the chest, back, and shoulders; the face\r\n and head become bloated and puffy, the tongue and eyes protrude.”\r\n\r\nBloody froth is sometimes seen at the nose and mouth.\r\n\r\nSALIVA is invariably secreted and runs out of the mouth down on the\r\nchin and chest. Its presence is considered as evidence that suspension\r\noccurred during life. The URINE and FÆCES are sometimes found to have\r\nbeen expelled. These discharges occur in all kinds of violent death.\r\nTardieu found them, however, but twice in 41 cases of hanging. Roth in\r\n49 cases found discharges of fæces in 17 and urine in 4; in 15 cases\r\nnot noticed.\r\n\r\nHarvey mentions a case where internal piles had burst, and there were\r\nstains and clots of blood about the perineum and anus. In such cases\r\nwithout careful examination there would naturally be a suspicion of\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nIn about one-fourth of the cases the GENITAL ORGANS are congested.\r\nThe penis is large and more or less erect; seminal fluid, generally\r\nprostatic, and sometimes mixed with blood, is often expelled. The fluid\r\nmay pass only into the urethra and it may be necessary to press the\r\nurethra to secure it. The clitoris may be found erect, and there may be\r\na sort of menstrual flow. Orfila showed by experiment that swelling of\r\nthe sexual organs and emission of semen can be produced after death in\r\nthose who had been suspended during life. The flow of semen is found\r\nin all kinds of death by violence. Roth in 39 cases of hanging of men\r\nfound the penis enlarged 18 times and ejaculation in 19. Hackel found\r\nthe penis swollen in 43 per cent of cases of asphyxia. Erection may\r\ncome on soon or late, even days after death.\r\n\r\n=Internal Appearances.=—The CONNECTIVE TISSUE UNDER THE MARK is\r\nusually white and condensed, the more so if the body has been long\r\nsuspended. This dryness or condensation was found by Hackel in 52 per\r\ncent of hangings. Deeper-seated parts are injured only when the hanging\r\nhas been violently done. The MUSCLES, especially the sterno-mastoid,\r\nare sometimes ruptured. Hofmann[851] reports several cases.\r\nLesser[852] in 50 hangings saw 11 ruptures of muscle. Maschka never saw\r\nthe rupture in suicides. The sterno-mastoid was ruptured in the case\r\nof Wirtz (Case 96) and Guiteau (Case 95). Hackel in 67 cases failed to\r\nfind the muscle ruptured. Hofmann[853] believes that the rupture of the\r\nmuscle is sometimes post mortem. Coutagne[854] found the sterno-mastoid\r\nmuscle ruptured once in 24 cases (Cases 29, 89, 95, 96).\r\n\r\nThe LARYNX may be fractured or dislocated. These lesions are very\r\nrare in suicide; more frequent in homicide and judicial hanging,\r\nand in the old where the cartilages are calcareous. Remer found the\r\ninjury in but 1 case in 101 of suicidal hanging. Barker found the\r\nlarynx _lacerated_ in his judicial cases.[855] Harvey says that the\r\nTRACHEA was reported lacerated 11 times in nearly 1,500 cases; twice\r\nthe laryngeal cartilages were separated from each other. In 5 these\r\ncartilages were fractured, but there was nothing to show under what\r\nconditions. Hemorrhage in vicinity of larynx, 43 times. Pellier[856]\r\nreports 1 case, and adds that the existence of the lesion easily\r\nescapes notice because of the mobility of the cornua. Roth in 49 cases\r\nfailed to find any fracture. Pellier found the cricoid was injured\r\noftener than the thyroid, which is the reverse of what is found in\r\nstrangulation. Cavasse[857] was unable to cause fracture of larynx by\r\nhanging the cadaver. Chailloux[858] collected 6 cases of fracture of\r\nlarynx in hanging. He concluded that the fracture could not be produced\r\non the cadaver by hanging, and is, therefore, caused during life.\r\nCoutagne[859] in 24 cases found fracture of thyroid cartilage 8 times\r\n(Cases 9, 51, 82).\r\n\r\nThe HYOID BONE is rarely dislocated. Orfila mentions a case of\r\nfracture. Barker found the bone usually fractured in judicial cases.\r\nIn the case of Wirtz (_supra_) the greater cornu was broken. Pellier\r\nreports 2 cases. Hofmann[860] says the hyoid cornua are often\r\nfractured, especially when the ligature is between the hyoid bone and\r\nthyroid cartilage. Coutagne found fracture of hyoid bone 8 times in\r\n24 cases. He attributed the fracture to pressure against the spine.\r\nPellier speaks of fracture of STYLOID PROCESS (Cases 51, 84, 88, 89,\r\n95, 96).\r\n\r\nDr. Barker, of Melbourne,[861] states that in 50 cases of hanging by\r\nthe old method there was not one case of _fracture or dislocation of\r\nvertebræ_. After adopting his suggestion to place the knot near the\r\nspine, he found that dislocation occurred between the second and third\r\ncervical vertebræ with fracture of the third and pressure on the spinal\r\ncord. Death was sudden and complete. The drop in these cases was short,\r\nthree to four feet. Coutagne thinks that the ordinary mobility of the\r\nhead, axis, and atlas on each other have led reporters into the mistake\r\nof supposing a dislocation of vertebræ. Roth failed to find fracture\r\nof vertebræ in any of 49 cases. These injuries are especially rare in\r\nsuicide; but in violent hanging, dislocation or fracture may occur and\r\nalso rupture of the ligaments. Harvey gives 5 cases of dislocation of\r\nvertebra and 4 of fracture of vertebra in suicides. Three of the latter\r\nwere doubtful. Tardieu says these fractures have no significance as\r\nto the hanging having occurred during life. They can be produced on\r\nthe cadaver; but infiltration of clotted blood around injured vertebræ\r\nshows that suspension occurred during life (Cases 5, 7, 8, 68, 76 to\r\n79, 83, 84, 91, 92, 94).[862]\r\n\r\nThe CAROTID ARTERIES may be injured; usually the inner and middle\r\ncoats are torn; and hemorrhage may occur into the wall of the vessel.\r\nThe common carotids are the ones usually affected, and just below\r\nthe bifurcation, but the external is also occasionally injured. The\r\ninjury is said to be due to the stretching and squeezing of the artery,\r\nstretching being the most effective since the rupture often occurs at\r\na distance from the mark of the ligature. Such injury of the artery\r\ndoes not prove that hanging took place during life because it has been\r\nproduced on the cadaver; but hemorrhage into the wall of the vessel\r\nor wound or rupture after death is very improbable. Maschka says the\r\nlesion is very rare. Tardieu says that the injury to the carotid is\r\nrare and therefore unimportant. Pellier reports 4 cases of rupture of\r\ncarotid in a total of 23. Levy records the experiments of Hofmann, of\r\nVienna, and Brouardel and himself, of Paris, 5 in number. He concluded\r\nthat compression of the carotid arteries, if it produces obliteration,\r\ncan cause rapid loss of consciousness and death; and explains why in\r\nincomplete suicide the subject is unable to help himself. Coutagne\r\nfound rupture of carotids 10 times in 24 cases. He insists on the\r\nimportance of the lesion.\r\n\r\n Hofmann[863] says the rupture is always transverse, may be simple\r\n or multiple and may occur in suicides; more apt to occur when the\r\n ligature is thin. Lesser[864] tabulated 50 fatal cases of suicidal\r\n hanging; in 29, he was satisfied that the hanging occurred during\r\n life. In 3 of these the skin of the neck alone showed any lesion;\r\n there was a double mark, the skin being otherwise bloodless. In 5\r\n the deeper soft parts were the only ones affected. In 3 the skin\r\n showed lesions, the deeper soft parts none, but either the hyoid\r\n bone, larynx, or vertebræ were involved. In 12 the skin showed no\r\n mark, but the deeper soft parts and either the larynx or hyoid bone\r\n were involved; and in 6 the hyoid bone only or the bone and larynx\r\n were injured. In the remaining cases it was not possible to say that\r\n the hanging occurred during life. In 2 cases there were no marks at\r\n all; in 9 there were changes in the skin; in 4, changes in the skin\r\n and deeper parts; in 2, changes in the skin, deeper parts, and hyoid\r\n bone or larynx; in 3, changes in the skin and hyoid bone or larynx,\r\n or both. In 14 of the 50 cases the hyoid bone was fractured; in 20\r\n the larynx; and in 1 the vertebræ. The common carotid arteries were\r\n injured in 6. The number and severity of the lesions bore no constant\r\n relation to the thickness of the ligature, nor to the force used, but\r\n rather to the position of the body.\r\n\r\n Ecker[865] reported a case of suicidal hanging in a man, age 40, where\r\n the soft palate was swollen and filled up the passage so that the air\r\n evidently could not enter.\r\n\r\nThe LARYNX and the TRACHEA are usually deeply congested, of a red\r\ncolor; a violet color indicates putrefaction. Ogston reports mucus but\r\nnot bloody froth 9 times in the pharynx, 6 in the trachea, and 4 in\r\nthe lungs, in a total of 40 cases. In one case there was a quantity\r\nof blood in the larynx and pharynx. Taylor thinks that pinkish froth\r\nin the trachea indicates incomplete obstruction; and Chevers that it\r\nis due to spasmodic efforts to breathe when the obstruction is nearly\r\ncomplete. Chevers always found clear mucus in the larynx and upper\r\npart of trachea, each follicle being marked by a minute globule of\r\nmucus. Harvey states that this was noted a few times in his reports.\r\nBaraban[866] discusses the condition of the epithelium of the air\r\npassages in hanging.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the lungs and heart varies according to whether death\r\nis due to syncope or asphyxia. Ogston found, in 22 cases, the lungs\r\nwere expanded in 4 and collapsed in 2.\r\n\r\nHarvey says the LUNGS are congested in over seven-eighths of the\r\ncases; emphysematous in a few; and subpleural ecchymoses present in\r\na few. Patenko[867] experimented on dogs by hanging them. When the\r\nconstriction occurred after expiration the lungs were congested; when\r\nafter inspiration, not congested. In the first case (p. 223) the blood\r\nflows from the periphery to the heart and thence to the lungs, but\r\ncannot flow from the lungs because of the difficult circulation in the\r\ndilated pulmonary vessels and deficiency of intrathoracic pressure.\r\nThere is in both cases cerebral congestion in the region of the bulb.\r\nTardieu holds that punctiform ecchymoses and apoplexies do not occur\r\nin hanging unless suffocation has preceded. Pellier,[868] however,\r\nfound these ecchymoses 14 times in 22 cases. He says that the lesion is\r\nnot characteristic of suffocation, and quotes Lacassagne, Grosclaude,\r\nDechoudans, Vicq, Chassaing, and Legroux to the same purpose.\r\nHofmann[869] says that the ecchymoses are relatively rare in adults.\r\nMaschka[870] found them 18 times in 153 cases.\r\n\r\nHarvey states that the presence of serum in the PERICARDIUM seems more\r\na matter of time elapsed after death than anything else. Still the fact\r\nis that it is found much oftener in strangulation than in hanging.\r\nThe difference is explained by the comparative slowness of death in\r\nstrangulation. Harvey finds that in about one-half of the cases, if\r\nthe body is fresh, the right side of the HEART, pulmonary artery, and\r\nvenæ cavæ are full of dark fluid blood, the lungs being also much\r\ncongested, and the signs of death by asphyxia well marked. When blood\r\nis found in both sides of the heart, it is probable that death is due\r\nto neuro-paralysis. When decomposition is advanced all the cavities are\r\noften empty. Taylor says that if the examination is delayed for several\r\ndays, the distention may not be observed.\r\n\r\nThe STOMACH is often much congested, and this fact might sometimes\r\nsuggest the possibility of poisoning. The LIVER, SPLEEN, and KIDNEYS\r\nare usually much congested. Hofmann[871] says that this occurs in the\r\nkidney only when the body has been hung a long time.\r\n\r\nThe BRAIN is rarely much congested. In 101 cases Remer found hemorrhage\r\nbut once; and in 106 cases Casper failed to find it. Tardieu[872]\r\nsays the brain is oftenest anæmic. If, however, the body is cut down\r\nand placed horizontally, the blood-vessels of the brain may fill up.\r\nEvidence may be found in the brain suggesting insanity and therefore an\r\nexplanation of a probable suicide. Harvey says that hemorrhages in or\r\nabout the brain are found in a much larger proportion of cases in India\r\nthan in Europe in cases of hanging. “No common condition likely to\r\ncause extravasation is apparent, only one man being noted as plethoric,\r\nbut in many the rope seems to have been very tight.” Champouillon[873]\r\nreports a case of suicide in a man, age fifty-two; the rope broke and\r\nthe body fell. The physician who made the necroscopy reported a rupture\r\nof the _pons Varolii_. Champouillon believed that the rupture must have\r\nbeen made in removing the brain from the skull. Wilkie[874] reports\r\na judicial hanging in which a man age about twenty-five, fell about\r\nthree and one-half feet. A recent clot was found in the brain. The\r\nexperiments of Brouardel of hanging rabbits showed the brain anæmic.\r\n\r\nThe conjunction of the following appearances would suggest that the\r\nhanging had been of some duration: lividity of face, congestion and\r\nprominence of eyes, dryness of skin under the ligature, deep furrow,\r\ncongestion of sexual organs, swelling and lividity of lower limbs,\r\nhypostatic congestion of lungs.\r\n\r\n Page experimented on a young cat and young dog; both were hung in the\r\n same way. Examination of the cat showed the veins generally engorged;\r\n sublingual veins much engorged; tongue protruded slightly and much\r\n swollen; no frothy mucus in bronchi. In the dog the tongue did not\r\n protrude and was not swollen; right cavities of heart contained blood,\r\n left empty; brain and other organs normal. In the cat, the lungs were\r\n uniformly congested, dark red; no ecchymoses. In the dog, the lungs\r\n were much distended, posterior borders mottled violet; emphysematous\r\n patches on surface; no apoplectic effusions; subpleural ecchymoses\r\n bright red, irregular, clearly defined in outer surface, most numerous\r\n toward the roots and on the lower lobes.\r\n\r\n Pellereau[875] gives an account of hanging as seen by him in warm\r\n climates. He had not seen the elongation of the neck described nor the\r\n erection of the penis, nor subconjunctival ecchymoses, nor fracture\r\n of larynx, nor rupture of walls of carotid artery, nor subpleural\r\n ecchymoses, nor fracture of vertebra. He always found a mark on the\r\n neck; the left cavities of the heart always empty, the right always\r\n full of black blood. Mackenzie says that in 130 cases of suicidal\r\n hanging, the protrusion of the tongue between the teeth, the open and\r\n protruding eyes, clinched hands, and blue nails were very frequent,\r\n the tongue was found bitten many times, there were urethral and\r\n rectal discharges and rupture of carotid artery. The penis was found\r\n erect several times. The hyoid bone fractured 24 times in 93 cases.\r\n In no case was the larynx or vertebra fractured. In 73 cases ropes\r\n were used; in 30, portions of clothing. The marks of ropes were\r\n always well defined, indented, and parchment-like; the marks of soft\r\n ligatures faint and reddish. In no case were the muscles of the neck,\r\n the larynx, trachea, or large bronchi injured, and in none was there\r\n subcutaneous hemorrhage or blister.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH BY HANGING.\r\n\r\nAs in strangulation, no single sign in any given case is sufficient of\r\nitself to prove that death was caused by hanging. But the sum total of\r\nthe lesions found, viewed in the light of the surroundings of the body,\r\nwill suffice to lead to a definite conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a body has been found suspended does not of itself prove\r\nthat hanging caused the death, because the victim may have been killed\r\nin some other way, and the body afterward hung up to avert suspicion.\r\nChevers records many cases of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe value of the presence or absence of marks on the neck and the\r\ncharacters of the marks has been questioned. Orfila, Casper, and Vrolik\r\nhave shown by experiment that if a body is hanged within one or two\r\nhours after death the furrow, parchment skin, lividity, and the density\r\nof the connective tissue will appear just as is seen when suspension\r\nhas occurred during life; but ecchymoses and infiltration, clotted\r\nblood in the skin, connective tissue, and muscles of the neck suggest\r\nsuspension during life.\r\n\r\nIf a cord is removed _immediately_ after death, there may be scarcely\r\nany mark at all.\r\n\r\nTardieu collected 261 cases of suicide by hanging where the subject\r\nwas not entirely off the ground. In 168 the feet rested on the ground;\r\nin 42 the subject was kneeling; in 29 lying down; in 19 sitting, and 3\r\nwere huddled up or squatting. Fatal hanging may, therefore, occur in\r\nalmost any position of body. He shows incomplete hangings by thirteen\r\nplates. Taylor also collected reports of 11 cases in a few years; in 3\r\nthe subjects were nearly recumbent; in 4, in a kneeling position; in 4,\r\nsitting. Remer in 101 cases of suicidal hanging found in 14 that the\r\nbody was either standing or kneeling; in 1, sitting. Duchesne published\r\n58 cases of partial suspension, 26 of which were new. Some of these\r\nfailures of complete suspension were due to soft and elastic cords.[876]\r\n\r\nTaylor says that “that which is difficult to a conscientious medical\r\njurist in confining himself to the medical facts is often easily\r\ndecided by a jury from these as well as the general evidence afforded\r\nto them.”\r\n\r\nThe limbs may be secured by the suicide before hanging himself. Persons\r\neven with some disability of the hand have suicided by hanging.\r\nBlindness is no obstacle, nor age; a boy as young as nine and a man as\r\nold as ninety-seven.\r\n\r\nBurger[877] fully discusses the question whether the hanging is before\r\nor after death.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANGING—SUICIDAL, HOMICIDAL, OR ACCIDENTAL?\r\n\r\nHanging is usually =suicidal=. Lesser[878] states that for three\r\nyears, 1876-79, there were admitted to the Berlin morgue 274 bodies of\r\n“hanged,” of which 272 were suicidal; 2 infants of three and eighteen\r\nmonths, homicidal. One man had first tried to kill himself with\r\nsulphate of copper; another by cutting his throat; a woman by cutting\r\nher arm. The other cases were uncomplicated. Pellier states that the\r\nnumber of suicides in France from 1876-1880 was 13,445, and nearly\r\nall were by hanging. Taylor[879] states that 2,570 persons committed\r\nsuicide by hanging in England in five years, 1863-67; four-fifths of\r\nthese were males. Harvey[880] reports for three years 1,412 cases\r\nof hanging in India, of which 2 were accidental, in 3 there was\r\npresumption of homicide, the rest probably all suicidal.\r\n\r\nFeebleness of body does not preclude subjects taking their lives in\r\nthis way. They sometimes also wound or poison themselves first and\r\nhang themselves afterward. A subject being found suspended in a room\r\nfastened on the inside, would be suggestive of suicide. The absence of\r\nsigns of struggling or of any marks of injury also favors the idea of\r\nsuicide.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of a suicide breaking a rope, being injured by the\r\nfall, and rehanging himself successfully, must be admitted (Cases 57,\r\n58). The possibility of blood flowing after death must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that after beating or other violence children and\r\nwomen may commit suicide from shame. Again, as Tardieu says, many have\r\nhung themselves while partially intoxicated, and it is likely that\r\nsome such have just previous to the suicide met with falls or other\r\naccidents which have left marks like those of violence. He also records\r\nthe case of a woman who fastened a cord to a bed-post, put her head in\r\na noose while kneeling on the bed, and made a deep wound in her arm\r\nwith a razor. She closed the razor, laid it aside, and fainted from\r\nloss of blood. She must then have fallen forward and died from the\r\npressure of the cord on her neck.[881]\r\n\r\n=Homicidal= hanging is rare but does occur. Where the hands are tied\r\ntogether; where the injuries produced by the cord are severe; where\r\nthere are contusions and well-marked ecchymoses; where the laryngeal\r\ncartilages and hyoid bone are fractured or the cervical vertebræ\r\ndislocated or fractured; or where the carotids are injured or there\r\nis hemorrhage into their walls; where there are severe wounds, the\r\nhemorrhage from which would be sufficient to threaten syncope; where\r\nthere are many marks of violence on the body; where there is evidence\r\nof a severe struggle—in all these cases murder may be reasonably\r\nsuspected. The number, situation, extent, and direction of must\r\nbe carefully noted and weighed. If these are out of proportion to\r\nthe ligature, the suspension, etc., they strongly suggest homicide,\r\nalthough they may occur in suicide (see Cases 4, 11, 18, 20, 28, 29,\r\n44, 52, 55, 59, 66).\r\n\r\nHomicidal hanging may be committed by an assailant who is strong on\r\na subject who is weak, on a child, a woman, an old person; on one\r\nstupefied by liquor or narcotic poison; or by many combined against one\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nCases are reported where injuries were inflicted or poison given, and\r\nthe subject was afterward hanged to avert suspicion. Most of these\r\ncases are those of murder either by strangulation or suffocation (Cases\r\n64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 70, 74).\r\n\r\nSometimes hanging is =accidental=. Children and even older persons\r\nplay at hanging successfully. Taylor mentions the case of a boy who\r\nwitnessed a hanging and afterward tried the experiment himself to\r\nascertain the sensation, and caused his own death.\r\n\r\n Tardieu[882] relates the case of a man, T., age 37, of small stature,\r\n feeble constitution, very thin, of sinister face, eyes hollow but\r\n lively, cunning nose and mouth, who meeting a man aged 81, learned\r\n that he had some trouble with his leg and promised to cure him. The\r\n old man lived alone. T. told him to buy a strong cord as thick as his\r\n little finger and one and one-half yards long, and keep the whole\r\n thing a secret. T. would see him at his room at 7 P.M. The old man\r\n became suspicious and had T. arrested. The investigation showed that\r\n already T. had made away with three old men by hanging, who were known\r\n to be opposed to suicide. Their bodies showed no trace of violence.\r\n Two others had escaped when the cord was passed around their necks.\r\n\r\nTardieu gives a number of cases of suicidal hanging which were falsely\r\nattributed to criminal violence, in which the pressure of public\r\nopinion joined to circumstances improperly explained by inexpert\r\nphysicians caused deplorable judicial errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIVE CASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUICIDE.\r\n\r\n1. _Harvey: Indian Med. Gaz., 1876, xi., p. 2._—Man, age 30. Found\r\nhanging by turban to bars of cell door; slip-knot around neck; heart\r\nbeating feebly; died in about a minute after being cut down. “The point\r\nof suspension was forty-seven inches from the ground, the position\r\nof the noose twenty-eight inches, and the feet were forty-two inches\r\naway from the door supported on the toes.” Experiment showed that the\r\nturban could not have borne the full weight of the body. He died from\r\nstrangulation.\r\n\r\n2. _Ibid., p. 3._—Insane man, age 60. Put his neck in a V-shaped fork\r\nof a tree and let his body swing. A broad abrasion found on each side\r\nof neck. Scalp, brain, and membranes much congested; reddish serum\r\nin lateral ventricles; two ounces clear fluid in pericardium. Lungs\r\ncongested; all the heart cavities contained blood.\r\n\r\n3. _Ibid., p. 5._—Woman, age 28. Two marks of ligature on neck; one\r\ndeep and circular passed up behind left ear; the other passed from the\r\ncircular mark behind, crossed it on either side under lower jaw, thence\r\nup to chin. Appeared at first to be a case of strangulation following\r\nhanging; but the two marks were finally explained, that after the body\r\nwas taken down it was ordered up again until the police should arrive.\r\n\r\n4. _Ibid., p. 5._—Man, age 45; first cut his throat and then hung\r\nhimself. “He had probably only just had time to hang himself before\r\ndying.”\r\n\r\n5. _Ibid., p. 30._—Woman; hung herself with a twisted cloth. There\r\nwas much ecchymosis about the neck and upper part of chest; lungs much\r\ncongested; fibrin clot in left mitral orifice; liver, spleen, and\r\nstomach congested; transverse ligament of atlas ruptured.\r\n\r\n6. _Ibid._—Man, age 39. Distinct mark of cord around neck; no other\r\nmark of violence; laceration of larynx and dislocation of odontoid\r\nprocess; hands clinched; involuntary discharge of semen; thoracic and\r\nabdominal organs normal.\r\n\r\n7. _Ibid._—Man, age 70. Mark of cord around the neck, superficial\r\nin front, deep behind; second cervical vertebra dislocated; tongue\r\nslightly protruding; fingers clinched; meningeal vessels engorged;\r\nlungs tubercular, congested; right heart contained a little coagulated\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n8. _Ibid._—Sex and age not given. Found hanging on a tree; usual\r\nsigns; odontoid process fractured; rope in a double noose without knot,\r\na common _dooree_, such as is used for drawing water.\r\n\r\n9. _Ibid., p. 32._—Man, age 50. Face livid, eyes red and protruding;\r\nteeth clinched; lower jaw retracted; tongue behind the teeth; hands and\r\nfeet contracted; anus covered with fæcal matter; circular depressed\r\nmark of cord around neck, hard as parchment, slightly ecchymosed along\r\nedges; some infiltration of blood in connective tissue beneath the\r\ncord; some tearing of soft parts; laryngeal cartilage displaced. Brain\r\nand membranes congested. Right cavities of heart distended with dark\r\nblood. Trachea congested.\r\n\r\n10. _Hurpy: Ann. d’ Hygiene, 1881, vi., pp. 359-367, with\r\nillustration._—Woman, age 77, suicided by hanging in the following\r\nway: a short cord was fastened by one end to a table leg; the\r\nother end was around her neck; she lay on the floor, face downward,\r\nclothing not disordered. The brain was congested; lungs congested and\r\nemphysematous; left side of heart empty (see Fig. 23).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—Suicide. The cord on the neck is 44 cent. from\r\nthe cord on the table leg; vertex of head 30 cent. from table leg.

He lived two days.\r\n\r\n12. _Pellier: Lyon thesis, 1883, No. 188, p. 72._—Boy, age 16, hung\r\nhimself; rope broke; he was resuscitated; reddish circular furrow on\r\nneck, not like parchment; he had erection and ejaculation; buzzing in\r\nhis ears and flashes before his eyes.\r\n\r\n13. _Lacassagne: Pellier thesis (supra), p. 71._—Man; hung himself;\r\nwas cut down and sent to hospital; was aphonic for four days; then\r\na severe bronchitis set in, and at the end of a week a gangrenous\r\nexpectoration. The mark of the cord lasted fifteen days.\r\n\r\n14. _Maschka: Archiv. de l’anthrop. crim., Paris, 1886, i., pp.\r\n351-356._—Man, age about 60, found dead under a tree in the woods\r\nnear Prague. No sign of violence. A cord thick as a sugar-loaf around\r\nthe neck; another cord attached to a branch of the tree. There was at\r\nfirst a strong suspicion of violence, but the conclusion reached was\r\nthat he had hung himself and that the body had fallen from breaking of\r\nthe cord; that death was due to asphyxia was shown by the furrow on\r\nthe neck, the dark liquid blood, and the congested lungs. There was no\r\ninfiltration below the furrow in the neck, and no lesion of larynx. The\r\nman had shown signs of melancholy.\r\n\r\n15. _Friedberg: Virchow’s Archiv, 1878, lxxiv., p. 401._—Suicidal\r\nhanging. Examination twenty-eight weeks after death.

Colleg., 1878, iv., pp.\r\n97-112._—1st. Woman, age about 25; found dead sitting in bed, a\r\nhandkerchief around her neck fastened to the bed-curtain. The police\r\nthought she had been killed and then hung, but the physician concluded\r\nthat she had committed suicide. An examination of the stomach showed\r\nthat she had previously tried to poison herself with arsenic.\r\n\r\n19. 2d. Woman, age 51; found hanging in half-lying position.\r\n\r\n20. 3d. Man, age 50. First tried to kill himself with phosphorus, then\r\nsulphuric acid; finally hung himself in a half-kneeling position.\r\n\r\n21. _Müller-Beninga: Berlin. klin. Woch., 1877, xiv., p. 481._—Man,\r\nage 40; hung himself. There was no swelling of genitals and no soiling\r\nof clothing. Necroscopy showed death from asphyxia, and in urethra near\r\nmeatus quite a quantity of seminal fluid, as shown by microscopical\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n22. _Tardieu: Op. cit., p. 18._—The Prince of Condé was found hanging\r\nin his room, August 27th, 1830. He was suspended by two handkerchiefs\r\nto a window fastening, his feet, however, touching the floor. The knot\r\nwas at the back of the neck (as shown by the illustration), the face\r\nturned slightly to the left, the tongue protruding; face discolored;\r\nmucus at the mouth and nose; arms hanging and stiff; fists shut; heels\r\nraised; knees half bent. The text says that the knot was nearly under\r\nthe right ear, but the illustration shows a different position (see\r\nFig. 22, p. 743).\r\n\r\n23. _Allison: Lancet, 1869, i., p. 636._—Three cases of suicide by\r\nhanging, in which there was no mark: 1st. Woman, hung herself with a\r\npiece of sheep-net band; cut down before death. 2d. Man, hung with\r\nplough-string; cut down in about six minutes. 3d. A heavy man.\r\n\r\n24. _Tardieu: Op. cit., pp. 93-105._—Woman, died of coma and asphyxia\r\nfrom suicidal hanging, according to report of Drs. Costan and Facieu.\r\nTardieu approved their report. It was at first thought a case of\r\nhomicide with subsequent hanging, more especially because of the kind\r\nof knot used, _nœud d’artificier_. But Tardieu showed that it was also\r\na _nœud de batalier_. Her feet touched a chair, and her knees were\r\nbent. There was a neckcloth in front of her mouth, but it did not seem\r\nto have interfered with respiration.\r\n\r\n25. _Ibid., pp. 67-72._—The famous case of Marc-Antoine Calas, who\r\ncommitted suicide by hanging (see Voltaire, “Traité sur le tolérance,”\r\netc., in _Nouv. Philos. Histor._, 1772, xxxii., p. 30). He hung himself\r\nto a door. No sign of violence. The city hangman said it was impossible\r\nfor a man to commit suicide in that way. The father was accused and\r\nconvicted of homicide. Tardieu shows that the act was a suicide.\r\n\r\n26. _Ibid., p. 72._—Another famous case. A woman, age 30, hung herself\r\nto the key of her bedroom door. Her husband cut her down. He was\r\naccused and convicted of the crime and condemned to prison, where he\r\ndied. Tardieu showed that the case was one of suicide.\r\n\r\n27. _Hofmann: Wien. med. Presse, 1880, xxi., p. 201._—Man, age 68,\r\nsuicide by hanging. There was profuse hemorrhage from both ears.\r\n\r\n28. _Ibid.: 1878, xix., pp. 489-493._—Woman, found dead sitting in\r\nbed. She first tried to poison herself with arsenic, then hung herself.\r\n\r\n29. _Ibid._—Man, tried to poison himself with phosphorus and sulphuric\r\nacid, then hung himself.

She was at once cut\r\ndown, bled, and taken to hospital unconscious. Next day, face red;\r\npulse and temperature normal. Third day, conscious and could speak,\r\nbut not aloud; tongue twisted and turned to right; paralysis of right\r\nhypoglossal nerve. Uvula drawn to left.

Two months later she was\r\nstill aphonic, but the vocal cords were in better action. The right\r\nhemiparesis was lessened.\r\n\r\n43. _Grant: Lancet, 1889, ii., p. 265._—Man, age 48; found sitting\r\nagainst a door, hung to the knob by a handkerchief.\r\n\r\n44. _White: Lancet, 1884, ii., p. 401._—Woman, age 53, insane. Made\r\nseveral attempts at suicide; once with a stocking around her neck, once\r\nwith an apron; the last time by fastening a portion of her dress to a\r\nladder. She was quickly cut down, cold affusion applied, and artificial\r\nrespiration (Sylvester). The eyes were prominent and glassy, pupils\r\nwidely dilated, no reaction to light; conjunctivæ insensitive; lips\r\nlivid; tongue swollen and pale; face pale; oblique depressed mark on\r\nneck, most marked on left side; skin cold; no pulse; no heart-beat\r\nrecognizable; no respiration; no reflex action. Galvanism failed to\r\narouse any muscular action. The details are too numerous to give all of\r\nthem. There was reduplication of heart-sounds for several days, due to\r\ninterference with pulmonary circulation. She recovered both bodily and\r\nmental health.\r\n\r\n45. _Richards: Indian Med.

Ligature between\r\nhyoid bone and larynx, then crossed over itself about middle line of\r\nneck, passed up along each side of face, knotted above the head, then\r\nthrown over a beam, and on the other side the loop was caught between\r\nhis legs.\r\n\r\n55. _Hoffman: Op. cit., p. 525, illustrated._—Case communicated by Dr.\r\nRosen, of Odessa. Man, age 21, and woman, age 17, hung themselves by\r\nsame ligature thrown over an open door, one of them on each side. They\r\nhad previously tried other means of suicide without success (see Fig.\r\n24).\r\n\r\n56. _Ibid., p. 530._—Man found hanging by handkerchief to branch of\r\ntree but sitting on the ground.

Gaz., 1876, xi., p. 3._—Woman, age 20,\r\nfeeble. Her mother-in-law had kicked her; she probably had fainted;\r\nsupposing her to be dead, the husband hanged her to a tree within half\r\nan hour after the supposed death. Autopsy: No marks of injury; oblique\r\nmark of cord on right side of neck; tip of tongue between the teeth;\r\nface somewhat livid; right side of heart full of dark blood; lungs\r\ncongested posteriorly.\r\n\r\n62. _Ibid., p. 4._—Woman, age 38. Rope close under the chin passed\r\nupward behind the ears. Head bent on chest. Large wound above clavicle.\r\nUnder the rope was a depression (made after death) but no hemorrhage.\r\nMuch blood in abdomen and a hole in the liver. Kidney bruised and\r\nblackened. Right lung torn through; blood in pleuræ. Wounds were\r\nsupposed to be gunshot, but the husband confessed that he had thrust a\r\nsharp solid bamboo into her body and afterward hung it up. She died of\r\nhemorrhage.\r\n\r\n63. _Rehm: Friedreich’s Blät. f. ger. Med., 1883, xxxiv., pp.\r\n332-362._—Man, age 73; first roughly maltreated; afterward hung.\r\n\r\n64. _Tardieu: Op. cit., p. 125._—Woman found hanging in her room.\r\nCircumstances indicated homicidal strangulation and that the hanging\r\nwas done to avert suspicion. Post-mortem examination showed the base\r\nof the tongue ecchymosed, and ecchymosis extending up to the soft\r\npalate; mucous membrane of pharynx congested; connective tissue and\r\nmucous membrane between hyoid bone and larynx congested posteriorly;\r\nepiglottis showed slight ecchymosis, mucous membrane red. These\r\necchymoses were not caused by the cord, for the latter was placed below\r\nthe hyoid bone and this bone was not broken. There were also marks on\r\nthe collar-bone like the mark of two hands.\r\n\r\n65. _Ibid., p. 124._—Girl, 15 years old. Body found hanging. Post\r\nmortem showed beyond doubt that she had been violated, then strangled,\r\nthen hung. Her head showed many ecchymoses from either the fist or the\r\nfoot; blood flowing from left ear. Brain slightly congested. Tongue\r\nbetween teeth, bitten and bloody. On front of neck were two marks: the\r\nlower were impressions of fingers close together, nearly uninterrupted,\r\nand which had bruised, flattened, and tanned the skin, which here was\r\ndry, hard, and horny. This lesion was above the intraclavicular notch\r\nand extended toward the sides of the neck with regularity of curve and\r\nneatness of imprint, evidently made with the right hand. Above the\r\nfirst furrow under the skin was a kind of track, less extended, more\r\nregular, a bruising of the same nature as the preceding, but continued,\r\ndue to the pressure of the index finger and thumb of left hand. A\r\nlittle below the jaw was a livid place on the skin, which was otherwise\r\nunaffected by the ligature. There was nothing to indicate a circular\r\naction of the ligature. Froth in larynx and bronchi. Lungs apparently\r\nnormal. Food had passed from stomach into œsophagus and air-passages.\r\n\r\n66. _Ibid., p._ 122.—Woman found hanging in her room, and was\r\nresuscitated. She stated that the man who lived with her had tried\r\nto strangle her and then hung her. Tardieu saw her in hospital.\r\nRespiration short and embarrassed; pains in neck and jaw. Found narrow,\r\ncircular, sinuous, horizontal, uninterrupted line around the neck below\r\nthyroid cartilage; line everywhere equal, deep, and three to four mm.\r\nwide; the skin excoriated and covered with thick crust. Below this were\r\nseveral superficial excoriations. There were many contusions on other\r\nparts of the body. Tardieu concluded that the mark on the neck was\r\nfrom attempt to strangle; the wounds elsewhere to prevent resistance.\r\nShe had at the time pulmonary consumption. She died of this disease\r\naggravated by the assault.\r\n\r\n67. _Ibid., p. 106._—The Duroulle affair. Woman found hanging.\r\nPresumption of homicide; arrest of husband; acquitted. She was found\r\nwith her face to the floor, one end of a cord around her neck; another\r\nsimilar cord attached seven feet above to a rafter, over which it\r\npassed three times. Bidault and Boulard reported it a suicide. The\r\nresults of the post mortem were as follows: Skin of a red-violet color;\r\nface swollen; eyes prominent and congested; conjunctivæ a vinous red;\r\nlips violet; tongue swollen, tip between teeth; froth in air-passages;\r\nlungs congested; brain congested; blood fluid. Circular depression\r\naround neck with congestion of skin above and below; ecchymosis in\r\nsubcutaneous tissue on level of angle of jaw and about one centimetre\r\nin size, supposed to correspond to the knot. Tardieu reported that\r\nthe marks rather resembled those of strangulation than hanging; the\r\necchymoses were more like those produced by the hand over the mouth.\r\nThe marks on the face supposed to have been made by a supposed fall of\r\nthe body were by him considered to have been caused by violence. He\r\nbelieved the woman had been strangled and then hung.\r\n\r\n68. _Ibid., p._ 130.—The Daugats affair. Man found hanging, sitting\r\non the ground, head and trunk somewhat inclined to the left; legs\r\nstretched out; clothing not disordered; the part of the cord which\r\nwas around the neck was applied to the neck of the waistcoat and\r\nshirt; on his head a woollen cap. The ground had been recently swept.\r\nNecroscopy twenty-four hours afterward. Face pale; right eye open and\r\nprominent, left closed; mouth closed, contained food apparently from\r\nthe stomach; tongue retracted; slight mark on neck under which the\r\ntissue was normal: atlas dislocated on axis, but tissues around were\r\nnormal; no lesion in spinal canal; penis not erect; moisture having the\r\nodor of urine on the shirt; large ecchymosis and infiltration of left\r\ncheek; extensive contusions on scrotum, with hemorrhagic infiltration,\r\nespecially around right testicle. Veins of head engorged with black\r\nfluid blood. Brain normal. Some black fluid blood in right cavities of\r\nheart, left side empty. Lungs black. Other organs normal. Causse and\r\nOrfila concluded that the man had been suffocated and then hung. The\r\nwife and son confessed that they had injured the testicle through the\r\npantaloons; he then fainted; they then suffocated him with the woollen\r\ncap placed over the mouth and nose; the son kneeled on the man’s belly,\r\nthe body was then hung up and the head violently twisted.\r\n\r\n69. _Passauer: Viert. f. ger. Med. und öff. San., 1876, xxiv., pp.\r\n26-49._—Woman found hanging in a kneeling position. The ligature on\r\nthe neck was loose. The necroscopy showed the following: Tongue between\r\nthe teeth; eyelids swollen and livid; livid spots on face and left ear;\r\nlower lip torn; a number of marks on neck; one red stripe not sharply\r\nlimited; skin not parchmenty and no ecchymosis; ecchymoses of scalp;\r\nperiosteum of skull reddened; hemorrhage in temporal muscle; brain and\r\npia mater congested; much fluid in ventricle. Larynx and trachea dirty\r\nred-brown; right side of heart empty; a little dark fluid blood in\r\nleft; great vessels, including aorta, containing much dark fluid blood.\r\nLungs congested and œdematous. Liver, spleen, and kidneys congested.\r\nOpinion given that she died of asphyxia and was either choked or\r\nhanged. Reference to Royal College of Medicine, Königsberg, where the\r\nopinion was given that she died of injuries on head and neck and was\r\nafterward hanged.\r\n\r\n70. _Becker: Same journal, 1877, xxvii., pp. 463-473._—Woman, age\r\n52; found hanging. Death caused by shock and incipient asphyxia from\r\nstrangulation and probably the wounds on head and limbs.\r\n\r\n71. _Maschka: “Samm. gericht. Gutacht.,” etc. (Prag), Leipzig, 1873_,\r\npublished a number of interesting cases, in each of which there was a\r\nquestion raised as to the cause of death.\r\n\r\n72. _Ibid., p. 127._—Man found dead. Had he been strangled or hung, or\r\nhad he died some other way? Opinion, death from paralysis of the brain.\r\n\r\n73. _Ibid., p. 133._—Woman, age 42; found hanging; a mark around her\r\nneck. Did she hang herself or die of other injuries? Opinion, died of\r\nother injuries.\r\n\r\n74. _Rehm: Friedreich’s Blätt., 1883, xxxiv., pp. 322-362._—Man, age\r\n73; found hanging. Opinion, while weak, sick, and suffering from wounds\r\ninflicted by his own son, he was hanged by his daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\n75. _Hofmann: “Lehrbuch,” p. 538._—A father hung his five children,\r\nthe eldest 9 years.

Jour., 1890, lii., p. 30._—Case\r\n16; child, 6 months old, sitting on a high chair, fell between the\r\nchair guard and seat and was asphyxiated by compression of neck.\r\n\r\nSee also Tidy (_op. cit._), Cases 53 and 54.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUFFOCATION.\r\n\r\nThe term suffocation is applied in a special sense to the act and\r\ncondition of preventing access of air in other ways than by pressure on\r\nthe neck, as by pressure on the chest, by obstruction at the mouth or\r\nnose, by obstruction in the air-passages or on them from neighboring\r\norgans, by irrespirable gases, etc.\r\n\r\nThis article will consider all of these except drowning and\r\nirrespirable gases, which are treated of elsewhere by other writers.\r\n\r\n=Smothering= is generally understood to mean the act and effect of\r\nstopping the mouth and nose.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES.\r\n\r\n=External Causes.=—OVERLAYING is a frequent cause of suffocation\r\nin infants, which in such cases have usually occupied the same bed\r\nwith one or both parents. In some cases the parents have been drunk\r\nor otherwise unable to prevent the injury, and the infant may also\r\nbe partly stupefied with the alcohol derived from its mother’s milk.\r\nInfants are also sometimes overlaid by domestic animals. Again, they\r\nhave been suffocated by being pressed too closely to the mother’s\r\nbreast, or by covering with bedclothes, shawls, etc. Noble[883]\r\nattributes some cases of asphyxia in the new-born to anæmia of the\r\nbrain from pressure on the skull by forceps, etc., and recommends as\r\ntreatment for this condition hanging the child head downward, so that\r\nthe blood may gravitate to the brain (Cases 12 and 30).\r\n\r\nInfants are sometimes smothered for mercenary purposes.\r\n\r\nPersons have been suffocated by the pressure of a crowd. Pressure on\r\nthe chest combined with forcible closure of the mouth and nose was\r\nthe method of Burke and Williams, in the notorious _burking_ murders\r\n(Case 58). The close application of a hand, cloth, or plaster over nose\r\nand mouth is of itself sufficient to cause suffocation, especially\r\nin children and feeble persons. Pressure on the abdomen crowds up\r\nthe diaphragm and interferes with breathing. It is very likely that\r\nno external mark will be found in cases of pressure on the chest and\r\nabdomen, but the lungs will be marbled and emphysematous.\r\n\r\nTaking plaster casts of the face and neck without inserting tubes in\r\nthe nostrils has caused death in some cases. Suffocation often follows\r\nthe falling of walls, houses, banks of earth, piles of coal or corn or\r\nwheat. One may fall into and be imbedded in some mobile substance as\r\ncoal, wheat, corn, quicksand, or nightsoil, and be suffocated. Infants\r\nhave been destroyed[884] by burying them in manure, ashes, bran, etc.\r\nIn these cases there is not only the entrance of the foreign body into\r\nthe air-passages, but the pressure of the mass against the chest and\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\n=Internal Causes.=—The air-passages may be closed up by foreign bodies\r\nwithin them, or within adjoining organs, especially the œsophagus.\r\nA great variety of substances in one of these two ways has caused\r\nsuffocation: mud, cotton, rags, corn, meat, beans, pepper, potato\r\nskins, the fang of a tooth, artificial teeth, buckles, shells, flint,\r\nbuttons, screws, crusts of bread, bones, fruit, stones, heads of grass,\r\ncoins, slate pencils, nuts, nut-shells, shot, penholders, worms,\r\nfish, etc. (see Cases 6 and 55). Taylor[885] states that there were\r\neighty-one deaths in one year in England and Wales from food in the\r\nair-passages.\r\n\r\nShould an inspiration occur in the act of vomiting, the vomitus may\r\npass into the air-passages; a similar accident may occur in a person\r\nwho attempts to swallow and speak at the same time. Infants have been\r\nsuffocated by inspiring vomited milk. Fitz[886] states that food may\r\npass from the digestive tube to the air-passages after death.\r\n\r\nA case of suffocation in an infant by retraction of the base of the\r\ntongue is recorded. It has been stated that negroes have committed\r\nsuicide by doubling back the tongue into the throat, or, as it is\r\ncalled, swallowing the tongue.[887] In giving anæsthetics, the subject\r\nbeing supine, and the head and neck somewhat flexed, the tongue,\r\nepiglottis, and soft palate may fall backward and suffocation may\r\nfollow. Howard[888] states that pulling the tongue forward under such\r\ncircumstances may reopen the pharynx, but will not lift the epiglottis.\r\nThe thorax should be raised and head and neck extended backward. He\r\nbelieves that in giving anæsthetics the head should be lower than the\r\nshoulders. In order to avoid vomiting no food should be taken for some\r\nhours before the anæsthetic.\r\n\r\nCases are recorded of artificial teeth having fallen from the mouth\r\ninto the air-passages during anæsthesia and sleep, and in epileptic\r\nand puerperal convulsions. It would appear advisable that these teeth\r\nshould be worn only while eating (Case 13).\r\n\r\nHemorrhage from the lungs, from rupture of an aneurism or from injury\r\nof the mouth or throat, may make its way into the air-passages and\r\ncause suffocation. So also the bursting of an abscess of the tonsils or\r\nother part near the air-passages (Case 7).\r\n\r\nŒdema of the glottis from scalding or other irritation of the fauces\r\nor glottis, or from disease of the kidneys; tumors pressing on some\r\nportion of the air-passages; rapid, profuse bronchial secretion in\r\ninfants; acute double pleuritic effusion; cheesy glands ulcerating\r\ninto trachea; simultaneous œdema of both lungs—all of these may cause\r\nsuffocation (Cases 18 and 49). [For cases of enlarged thymus gland, see\r\nHofmann, _op. cit._, pp. 587, 588.]\r\n\r\nParalysis of the muscles of swallowing, from diphtheria or other\r\ncause, predisposes to suffocation. Progressive asthenia in which\r\nthe muscles are exhausted; injury of spinal cord or pneumogastrics;\r\nparalysis of muscles of respiration from the use of curare; the\r\nspasms of tetanus and strychnia poisoning; the entrance of air into\r\nthe pleural cavities with collapse of the lungs—all tend to cause\r\nmechanical suffocation either by pressure or by paralysis (for deaths\r\nin epileptics, see Cases 1, 10, 11, 33, and 40).\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that the air-passages should be _absolutely_ closed\r\nto cause suffocation.\r\n\r\nThe _cause of death_ is more likely to be pure asphyxia, because of the\r\nabsence of the complicating pressure of the hand or ligature on the\r\nvessels and nerves of the neck, and of fracture of larynx or vertebræ.\r\n\r\n=Symptoms.=—Foreign bodies[889] entering the trachea naturally fall\r\ntoward the right bronchial tube instead of the left because of the\r\nsize and position of the entrance of the right tube. If then but one\r\ntube is involved, the signs will usually be on the right side; whereas\r\nif the foreign body stop in the larynx or trachea, both sides will be\r\naffected. The latter condition is much more dangerous. The symptoms\r\nwould be resonance over the lung with the respiratory murmur partly or\r\nwholly absent; less mobility; puerile breathing on the unaffected side.\r\nIn either case there may at first be little disturbance, especially\r\nif the shape of the foreign body is such as not to greatly interfere\r\nwith the access of air; otherwise there may be at once, and almost\r\nalways will be after a time, more or less urgent dyspnœa. Diminution of\r\nthe necessary oxygen may cause convulsions, apoplexy, and other brain\r\nsymptoms. Acute emphysema of the portion of lung not obstructed may\r\nfollow its forcible distention. The local effect of the foreign body is\r\nan irritation which causes spasm and cough. It may be carried upward by\r\nthe expirations and downward again by each inspiration. Inflammation\r\nis likely to appear eventually and may involve the lung. If the\r\nobstruction is not complete there may follow periods of alternation of\r\ngood and bad health, ending perhaps in recovery. The foreign body may\r\nbe expelled after a greater or lesser interval. On the other hand death\r\nmay result from secondary causes. In the absence of correct history\r\nthe symptoms may lead to a wrong diagnosis and inappropriate treatment;\r\nas where a patient whose symptoms resulted from the presence of a piece\r\nof bone in the larynx, was treated for syphilis. A foreign body may be\r\ncoughed up from the lung into the trachea and fall backward into the\r\nopposite lung.\r\n\r\nPartial closure of the larynx, most likely caused by a flat or\r\nirregular substance, rather than globular, may cause gradual asphyxia\r\nwith symptoms of apoplexy, making the diagnosis difficult.\r\n\r\nWhen a foreign body remains a long time in the larynx, spasmodic cough\r\nand croupy breathing usually ensue, expectoration tinged with blood,\r\nhoarseness, or complete aphonia, pain, dyspnœa, possibly crepitation\r\nand dulness over the lungs. The case may end suddenly in death from\r\nclosure of the glottis, or the foreign body may pass into the trachea\r\nand set up a new train of symptoms, or it may be expelled.\r\n\r\nThe frequency with which foreign bodies in the pharynx or œsophagus\r\nobstruct respiration, and the facility with which they may usually be\r\nremoved, suggest a careful examination. Otherwise the patient may be\r\ntreated indefinitely for supposed obstruction in the air-passages.\r\nForeign bodies in the œsophagus have perforated into the trachea, and\r\neven the lungs, heart, and aorta.\r\n\r\n In complete suffocation death will occur in from two to five\r\n minutes (see remarks under Strangulation). Death may also occur\r\n instantaneously.\r\n\r\n The experiments of the Committee on Suspended Animation[890] showed\r\n that when the trachea of a dog was exposed, incised, and a tube tied\r\n in, the average time covered by the respiratory efforts after stopping\r\n up the tube with a cork was four minutes five seconds; the heart-beat\r\n stopping at seven minutes eleven seconds on the average. After four\r\n minutes ten seconds it seemed to be impossible for the dog, unaided,\r\n to recover. Faure[891] made the following experiment upon a large dog:\r\n He fixed a cork in the trachea. At first the dog was quiet; it then\r\n extended its neck, parted its jaws, and made efforts as if to vomit;\r\n then tried to walk, but its gait was uncertain; fell down and rose\r\n up. Its eyes became dull, and finally it fell down on its side, and\r\n became convulsed; then after several seconds stretched itself out.\r\n The thoracic movements were at first tumultuous, then became rapidly\r\n feeble; the heart beating very slowly. At the necroscopy the lungs\r\n filled the thorax, were full of thick dark blood and emphysematous.\r\n The blood was black and fluid in the left ventricle and arteries,\r\n and in the right cavities and veins resembled molasses. Liver darkly\r\n congested. There was no mucus in the trachea and no ecchymosis in\r\n the lungs. He also (p. 306) tried the experiment upon a large dog of\r\n fastening boards against its thorax and tightening them by means of\r\n cords. For some minutes it was quiet, but suddenly it became much\r\n agitated, stood upon its hind legs, threw itself against the wall,\r\n rolled on the ground, and uttered frightful cries; finally fell on\r\n its side. There was no movement of the thorax, but the muscles of\r\n the neck and belly were in full and rapid action, dry and sonorous\r\n râles were heard, and a large quantity of mucus appeared at the nose\r\n and mouth. The movements grew feebler, the respirations infrequent,\r\n and at the end of thirty-four minutes it was dead. The necroscopy\r\n showed the blood black and thick; heart relaxed; lungs red, a little\r\n emphysematous, containing but little blood, and on their surface were\r\n blackish points and small red spots.\r\n\r\n The death of Desdemona (Shakespeare’s “Othello”) has been much\r\n criticised. The declaration that she was strangled (or suffocated)\r\n does not consist with the symptoms described (see _Med. News_,\r\n Philadelphia, May 1st, 1886, p. 489).\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe obvious indication is to search for and remove the obstruction. The\r\nmeans and methods of treatment are fully treated of in surgical works,\r\nbut may be briefly mentioned here.\r\n\r\nLaryngoscopical examination may be necessary. A curved forceps is\r\nusually the best instrument for removing the foreign body. A tallow\r\ncandle may serve to push it into the stomach if there is no bougie at\r\nhand. Suction may be used. Sneezing may be brought on by tickling the\r\nnostrils; coughing by tickling the glottis; vomiting by irritating the\r\nfauces, or by emetic; the body of the subject may be inverted and in\r\nthis position the fauces may be tickled, or fingers may be passed back\r\ninto the pharynx. Johnson[892] says that at the moment of inversion the\r\npatient should try to take a deep inspiration; this opens the glottis\r\nand facilitates the expulsion of the foreign body. The inspiratory\r\ncurrent has no appreciable effect in retarding the movement of the\r\nforeign body in the direction of gravity.\r\n\r\nNoble recommends inversion of the body in new-born infants in which\r\nasphyxia may be supposed to be due to anæmia of the brain. Tracheotomy\r\nor laryngotomy may be necessary. It may be necessary to administer\r\noxygen. Foreign bodies like beards of grass and fish-heads can be\r\nwithdrawn only with difficulty because of their sharp projections.\r\nIntense suffering and dyspnœa in a robust subject may necessitate\r\nvenesection. Generally speaking it is better to bring up the foreign\r\nbody than to push it down into the stomach. Beveridge suggests to\r\nblow into the ear, to induce a reflex action and cause expulsion of\r\nthe foreign body. Cold affusions, artificial respiration, galvanism,\r\nfrictions of the limbs, artificial heat, stimulants by mouth and\r\nrectum, may one or all be needed.\r\n\r\nHamilton[893] says that it is useless to expect good results from\r\nelectricity if five minutes have elapsed since life appeared to be\r\nextinct; Althaus,[894] that three hours after death the muscles will\r\ncease to respond to faradization; and Richardson,[895] that a low\r\ntemperature prolongs the sensitiveness of the muscle.\r\n\r\nWith regard to insufflation, Le Bon[896] objects to it in asphyxia as\r\nbeing hurtful and not useful. Colin[897] tamponed the trachea of a\r\nhorse; in four minutes fifty seconds it was apparently dead; the tampon\r\nwas removed and insufflation practised for fifteen to twenty minutes\r\nwithout effect. He claims that artificial respiration is useless after\r\nthe circulation ceases.\r\n\r\nFell[898] and O’Dwyer[899] recommend forced inspiration. McEwen[900]\r\nuses a tracheal tube by the mouth.\r\n\r\n Dew[901] offers a new method of artificial respiration in asphyxia\r\n of the new-born; Lusk[902] considers the subject of life-saving\r\n in still-births; Forest,[903] artificial respiration in the same;\r\n Read[904] discusses Schultze’s method with approval; Duke[905] plunges\r\n the infant into hot water; Richardson[906] recommends artificial\r\n circulation by injection of vessels, or electric excitation;\r\n Jennings[907] recommends the same; Richardson[908] also considers\r\n fully the subject of artificial respiration and electrical excitation;\r\n Woillez[909] has described and recommended what he calls a spirophore.\r\n\r\nAfter the removal of a foreign body the irritation remaining may cause\r\na sensation as if the body was still lodged.\r\n\r\nDeath may occur from hemorrhage after its removal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM APPEARANCES.\r\n\r\nThese are mainly those of asphyxia. There may also be evidences of\r\nexternal violence, homicidal or accidental, as of pressure on the\r\nchest. Persistent deformity, flattening of the nose and lips, and\r\nexcoriation of these parts may result from forcible closure of mouth\r\nand nose.\r\n\r\nThe SKIN AND CONJUNCTIVA usually show patches of lividity and\r\npunctiform ecchymoses; especially lividity on the lips and limbs. The\r\nface may be pale or violet; it is often placid, especially if the\r\nsuffocation is accidental. Tardieu[910] admits that infiltration of the\r\nconjunctiva and punctiform ecchymoses of the face, neck, and chest may\r\nalso be found sometimes in women after severe labor, and in epileptics.\r\nHe records the result of the examination of those who died from\r\nsuffocation at the Pont de la Concorde, 1866. The face and upper parts\r\nof the trunk were generally light red to a deep violet or black color,\r\nwith punctated blackish ecchymoses on the face, neck, and upper part of\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nThe EYES are usually congested. Mucus and sometimes bloody froth are\r\nfound about the NOSE and MOUTH. The TONGUE may or may not protrude.\r\n\r\nThe BLOOD is usually dark and very fluid. Wounds after death may bleed.\r\nAccording to Tardieu[911] fluidity of the blood is most constant in\r\ncompression of the chest and abdomen, as also its accumulation in the\r\nvessels and right side of heart. Its color varies from red to black.\r\n\r\nThe BRAIN and pia mater are generally congested. This is said to be\r\ninvariable if the eyes are congested. Mackenzie in thirteen cases found\r\nthe brain congested in all.\r\n\r\nThe HEART varies much in appearance and condition. The right side is\r\noften full of blood; occasionally empty. Sometimes subpericardial\r\necchymoses are found, usually along the coronary vessels. The blood in\r\nthe heart may be partly coagulated if the agony has been prolonged and\r\nthere has been a partial access of air, which is gradually diminished.\r\nMackenzie[912] found the right cavities full and the left empty in\r\nnine out of thirteen cases. Johnson[913] as a result of experiment\r\non animals claims that when access of air is prevented there is a\r\nrise in pressure in the arteries, the right side of the heart fills,\r\nthe pulmonary capillaries become empty, and therefore the left side\r\nof the heart becomes empty. As a result of further experiments[914]\r\nhe verified his former conclusion, and added that in the last stage\r\nof asphyxia there is increased pressure on the pulmonary artery and\r\nlessened pressure in the systemic vessels. He thinks[915] that when\r\nboth sides of the heart contain blood, there is paralysis of vaso-motor\r\nnerves and the arteries.\r\n\r\nThe TRACHEA is usually bright red and often contains bloody froth. The\r\nLARYNX or trachea as well as PHARYNX or ŒSOPHAGUS may contain a foreign\r\nbody. If the latter has been removed the resulting irritation may be\r\nseen. The LUNGS are sometimes congested, at others normal; color red or\r\npale. Sometimes one lung only is affected. They may be emphysematous.\r\nMackenzie found them congested in all of thirteen cases examined by\r\nhim. The lungs of young persons may be found comparatively small,\r\nalmost bloodless, and emphysematous. Tardieu, Albi, and others believed\r\nthat the _punctiform subpleural ecchymoses_ indicated suffocation, and\r\nwere due to small hemorrhages from engorged vessels which ruptured\r\nin the efforts at expiration. These spots are usually round, dark,\r\nfrom the size of a pin-head to a small lentil, and well defined.\r\nThey are not like the petechiæ in the lungs and heart after purpura,\r\ncholera, eruptive fevers, etc., nor like the hemorrhages under the\r\nscalp after tedious labor, all of which are variable in size. These\r\npunctiform spots are usually seen at the root, base, and lower margin\r\nof the lungs. Hofmann states (“Lehrbuch”) that they are found in the\r\nposterior part of the lungs and in the fissures between the lobes. They\r\nare indisputably frequent after death from suffocation, and if well\r\nmarked either in adults or infants that have breathed, they indicate\r\nsuffocation, unless some other cause of death is clear. Simon, Ogston,\r\nand Tidy, however, have shown that they are sometimes absent in fatal\r\nsuffocation, and are sometimes present in the absence of suffocation,\r\nas after hanging and drowning; in fœtuses before labor has begun;\r\noften in still-births, although some of these are probably due to\r\nsuffocation from inhaling fluid or from pressure. Also in death from\r\nscarlet fever, heart disease, apoplexy, pneumonia, and pulmonary œdema.\r\nGrosclaude[916] quotes from Pinard, who declares that these ecchymoses\r\nare found in fœtuses which die from arrest of circulation. Grosclaude\r\nhimself made a large number of experiments on animals by drowning,\r\nhanging, and strangling, and fracturing the skull. The ecchymoses were\r\nfound in nearly all the cases.\r\n\r\nThe ecchymoses are partly the result of venous stasis, which overcomes\r\nthe resistance of some capillaries; and the latter rupture, partly from\r\nthe aspirating action of the thoracic wall, the lung being unable to\r\nfill itself with air, but mainly[917] from vaso-motor contraction and\r\nlateral pressure at the maximum of the asphyxia, the time of tetanic\r\nexpiration. If the asphyxia is interrupted before this stage, the\r\nspots do not appear. Similar ecchymoses may be found under the scalp,\r\nin the tympanum, retina, nose, epiglottis, larynx, trachea, thymus,\r\npericardium, in the parietal pleura, along the intercostal vessels,\r\nrarely the peritoneum, in the stomach, and sometimes the intestines;\r\nand in other parts of the body, especially the face, base of neck, and\r\nfront of chest; in convulsive affections, as eclampsia and epilepsy,\r\nand in the convulsions of strychnia and prussic acid poisoning there\r\nmay be suffusion and congestion of the lungs though not the punctated\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nMackenzie, in thirteen cases of suffocation from various causes, failed\r\nto find the Tardieu spots either externally or internally. Briand and\r\nChaudé[918] state that they are less constant and characteristic in\r\nthose who have been buried in pulverulent substances.\r\n\r\nOgston[919] holds that in infants that are smothered the ecchymoses\r\nare found in greater number in the thymus gland; while in adults dying\r\nfrom other forms of asphyxia they were found only once in that gland.\r\nThe spots are found in clusters in infants that are smothered, but\r\nonly single and scattered in adults who die from drowning, hanging or\r\ndisease. They were wanting in the lungs of but one infant.\r\n\r\nThey may be recognized as long as the lung tissue is unchanged. The\r\napoplectic spots in the lungs seen in strangulation are not found in\r\nsuffocation.\r\n\r\n Tardieu[920] from experiments on animals and examination of\r\n twenty-three new-born infants who showed traces of violence around the\r\n mouth, found the lungs rather pale and anæmic, subpleural ecchymoses\r\n well marked. All the deaths were rapid. In cases of compression of\r\n chest and abdomen[921] the congestion of the lungs was extensive,\r\n and pulmonary apoplexy frequent; more so than in other forms of\r\n suffocation. He gave strychnia to animals which died in convulsions,\r\n and found very irregular and partial congestions, generally not\r\n marked because death was so prompt; blood always fluid; no subpleural\r\n ecchymoses.\r\n\r\nThe LIVER, SPLEEN, and KIDNEYS are generally congested; the kidney more\r\nthan the other organs named. The spleen is said to be often anæmic.\r\nSemen has sometimes been found, unexpelled, in the urethra.\r\n\r\n Page[922] experimented on three kittens, suffocating them in cinders.\r\n The post-mortem examinations showed the veins engorged, left side\r\n of heart empty, right side full of dark, half-clotted blood. Lungs\r\n distended, much congested, color violet; many small fluid hemorrhages\r\n in substance; no subpleural ecchymoses. Frothy mucus tinged with blood\r\n in trachea and bronchi; bronchi congested. Brain and abdominal organs\r\n normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOF OF DEATH BY SUFFOCATION.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes difficult in a given case to state WHETHER DEATH IS DUE\r\nTO SUFFOCATION. There is no lesion which of itself could be accepted as\r\nproof. But a collation of the lesions found taken in connection with\r\nthe surroundings of the body will in many if not in most cases lead to\r\na definite conclusion.\r\n\r\nInfants have been found alive four and five hours after having been\r\nburied in the earth.[923] If the pulverulent material has penetrated\r\ninto the œsophagus and stomach, the burial has occurred during life.\r\nExceptionally when burial has occurred after death and traces of the\r\nmaterial are found in the air-passages, they are _not_ found in the\r\nœsophagus or stomach.\r\n\r\n The committee on “Suffocation,” of the New York Med. Leg. Soc.,\r\n reported[924] the following group of appearances as evidences of\r\n death by suffocation: The general venous character of the blood, the\r\n turgidity of the larger veins, the congestion of the parenchymatous\r\n organs, especially at the base of the brain, the lungs congested in\r\n a variable degree and œdematous, frothy mucus in the bronchi, the\r\n right side of the heart always fuller than the left. Fitz[925] holds\r\n that suffocation is a condition composed of a group of symptoms and\r\n appearances due most probably to accumulation of carbon dioxide in\r\n the blood and a deficiency of oxygen. The appearances are: The blood\r\n dark and fluid (though in gradual suffocation there may be clots in\r\n the right side of the heart), the right side of the heart full, venous\r\n congestion of the lungs (not constant), interstitial emphysema of the\r\n lungs, and venous congestion of the liver, kidneys, and brain. He\r\n prefers the word _engorgement_ to congestion in this connection.\r\n\r\nTardieu[926] holds that when in infants buried in pulverulent\r\nsubstances we find emphysema of the lungs in high degree, bloody froth\r\nin the air-passages, abundant subpleural and subpericardial ecchymoses\r\nand the blood fluid, the burial has occurred during life. The same\r\nlesions are found in small animals similarly treated.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that an intoxicated person or one in an\r\nepileptic spasm is practically helpless, and can, therefore, be\r\nsuffocated, accidentally or otherwise, under circumstances in which one\r\nin possession of his senses would be able to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL, HOMICIDAL, AND SUICIDAL SUFFOCATION.\r\n\r\n=Accidental suffocation= is frequent, as has already appeared.\r\n=Suicidal suffocation= is very rare. =Homicidal suffocation= occurs.\r\nForeign bodies have been forced into the air-passages. Smothering has\r\nbeen done by holding the face in various materials to prevent access\r\nof air; by pressure on the chest; by forcible closure of the mouth and\r\nnose as in burking; by laying compresses over the face, as in the case\r\nof King Benhadad,[927] whom Hazael killed. “And it came to pass on the\r\nmorrow that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water, and spread\r\nit over his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his stead.”\r\nBenhadad was already quite ill and not expected to live.\r\n\r\nDeath by suffocation[928] may be considered as presumptive of homicide\r\nunless the facts are already referable to accident.\r\n\r\nIn infants, suffocation is, of course, either accidental or homicidal;\r\nin adults usually accidental. The absence of signs of a struggle\r\nin adults suggests accident; unless there is cause of suspicion of\r\nprevious stupefying with narcotics.\r\n\r\nTaylor[929] calls attention to a dangerous practice among some\r\nattendants upon infants, of putting into the mouth of the child to\r\nquiet it a bag containing sugar; and instances a case in which the\r\nchild would have died of suffocation but for the fortunate discovery of\r\na part of the bag protruding from the mouth.\r\n\r\nIn ten years, 3,612 deaths were reported in the city of London, of\r\ninfants smothered by being overlaid.[930]\r\n\r\nInfants may be born into a mass of blood and fæces, from which the\r\nunattended mother in her weakness may be unable to remove them.\r\n\r\n Page[931] shows by experiment that the inspiratory effort when\r\n violently exerted is sufficient to convey small objects into the\r\n air-passages. Cinders passed thus into the trachea and œsophagus of\r\n kittens and rabbits. Berenguier[932] experimented on new-born pups,\r\n placing them in ashes, plaster, and starch. In ashes they lived\r\n fifteen hours; these found their way into the middle of the œsophagus,\r\n but were stopped at the glottis. Plaster and starch formed a paste\r\n with the oral mucus and the movement of the mass was not so great\r\n as the ashes. In no case did either of the materials pass beyond\r\n the glottis. Tardieu[933] examined three infants which had been\r\n buried during life. One was in ashes: the nose was obstructed, mouth\r\n full: ashes also in the œsophagus and stomach, but none in larynx\r\n or bronchi. The second infant was in manure; a greenish stuff was\r\n found in the mouth and stomach. The third in bran (confessed to by\r\n the mother); the nose and mouth were full, but there was none in the\r\n throat; a few grains in the trachea. Tardieu experimented on rabbits\r\n and Guinea pigs by burying them in bran, sand, and gravel, some of\r\n them being alive and the others dead. In those buried alive he found\r\n the substance filling the mouth and nose to the base of the tongue;\r\n in most of the cases the œsophagus and trachea were not penetrated.\r\n In the animals first killed and then buried, the substance had not\r\n passed into the mouth or nose. In one case only he found ashes in\r\n the larynx and trachea of a rabbit which had been buried many hours\r\n after death in a box of ashes. Matthyssen[934] held a Guinea pig, head\r\n downward, with its nose under mercury; the lungs were full of globules\r\n of mercury (which has a specific gravity of 13.5). A dog was plunged\r\n head first into liquid plaster-of-Paris; the plaster was found in the\r\n bronchial tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIVE CASES.\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL.\r\n\r\n1. _Huppert: Vier. ger.

(ENG.),\r\n\r\n  _Professor of Nervous Diseases, Georgetown University; Membre du\r\n  Congrès International d’Anthropologie Criminelle, etc._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH BY SUBMERSION OR DROWNING.\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE frequence and importance of drowning having arrested attention\r\nfrom the days of Noah’s Ark and those of Hippocrates down to the\r\npresent time, it is quite possible to array in chronological order the\r\nfictitious, transitory, and positive periods that mark the sequence of\r\nideas touching the subject.\r\n\r\nMooted questions relative to drowning have been debated since the\r\nfourteenth century; and modern statistics show the great development\r\nof this class of emergency, than which none is of more startling\r\ncharacter. In France between four and five thousand cases of this\r\nkind of accident are officially recognized each year, which is about\r\none-third of all the accidental deaths, and the number appears to\r\nincrease yearly. Nearly the same figures apply to the inland waters of\r\nEngland and Wales, not including the coast. The Board of Trade Return\r\nshows that out of 86,695 seamen who died in English ships abroad,\r\n53,673 were drowned, and a late report of the Fisherman’s Federation\r\nplaces the number drowned in the inland waters and upon the immediate\r\ncoasts of the United Kingdom and its adjacent islands as 6,268\r\nannually. The many hundreds drowned in the late _Victoria_ disaster\r\nand in the great storm that swept the British Isles are matters of\r\ncurrent knowledge. In our own country accounts of drowning are of daily\r\noccurrence, and help to the drowning forms the greater part of the\r\nwork done by that noble governmental branch, the Life Saving Service.\r\nNot only does the sea claim its numerous victims, but the great floods\r\nand cyclones have destroyed thousands, while on the lakes and rivers\r\ndrowning accidents are lamentably frequent. If the statistics of such\r\naccidents were as available as those of the late war, for instance, the\r\nexhibit would doubtless be surprising. Where the aggregation of killed\r\nin action is shown to be 67,058, there were drowned 106 officers and\r\n4,838 men. The small regular army lost 5 officers and 89 men from this\r\ncause; the negro troops, 6 officers and 289 men; and the volunteers\r\nfurnished a large contingent, the State of Ohio alone having lost 14\r\nofficers and 770 men from drowning.[935]\r\n\r\nAside from the point of view of public hygiene and that of pathology,\r\nfurther evidence is not wanting to show the medico-legal value of the\r\nphenomena of drowning, and the frequency and importance of the judicial\r\nquestions that may arise in this class of accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND PHENOMENA OF DROWNING.\r\n\r\nLate studies as to the cause and mechanism of _asphyxia by submersion_\r\nor drowning warrant our speaking of submersion as immersion complete\r\nenough to menace or to extinguish life.\r\n\r\nWhen an animated body or a part only of the body is immersed a\r\nsufficient time in water or any liquid medium whatever in such a way\r\nas to exclude fresh air from the respiratory orifices, suffocation\r\nfollows, and death by submersion or drowning takes place.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena occurring in such instances are mostly those common to\r\nimperfect aeration or non-aeration of the blood, and for this reason\r\nthe majority of medical writers describe asphyxia or apnœa, that is,\r\ndeath beginning at the lungs, as the determining cause of death by\r\ndrowning. It must not be thought that asphyxia is always the mode of\r\ndeath in those submerged, although it is commonly present in a certain\r\nnumber of cases. Other causes may often modify the circumstances of the\r\ndeath or directly produce it, as congestion of the brain and syncope,\r\nor the cause of death may be a mixed one. Occasionally one reads\r\naccounts of persons resuscitated from drowning who, on recovering from\r\nthe primary effects of the asphyxia, die suddenly without apparent\r\ncause after a lapse of a few minutes or several days. Such cases\r\nare explained as the secondary results of the arrested interstitial\r\nnutrition that took place during the period while breathing was\r\ntemporarily arrested. Another secondary cause is physical injury to the\r\nlungs from water penetration, which may result in a fatal pneumonia.\r\nA case related in England last summer is that of a drowning boy who,\r\non being resuscitated after submersion in contaminated water, suddenly\r\ndied of cholera.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODE OF DEATH IN DROWNING.\r\n\r\nSince various lesions may be found, accordingly as the death from\r\ndrowning has taken place from one or more of the foregoing modes, it is\r\nnecessary to have a clear notion of asphyxia and to study in detail the\r\nmechanism of arrest of the thoracic movements and of the hindrance to\r\nhæmatosis.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, there will be asphyxia when any obstacle hinders air\r\nfrom entering the pulmonary vesicles, or when the fluid that penetrates\r\nthem is of any other nature than the medium in which the animal is\r\ndestined to live. Consequently the name asphyxia is applied generically\r\nto all accidental conditions in which life is threatened by any\r\nintervention whatever of the respiration. (See MECHANICAL SUFFOCATION,\r\nVol. I., p. 705 _et seq._, and ASPHYXIATING GASES, Vol. IV.)\r\n\r\nSubmersion in any liquid medium causes asphyxia. This condition may be\r\ncaused on being surrounded by a medium devoid of oxygen and improper to\r\nsupport sufficient hæmatosis, as hydrogen, nitrogen, and the protoxide\r\nof nitrogen, gases not toxic properly speaking, but considered\r\nirrespirable. Diminished respiration from deficiency of oxygen is the\r\ntrue cause of asphyxia. No animal can maintain the respiratory process\r\nin an atmosphere devoid of oxygen or in one that does not contain\r\nat least ten per cent of this gas, and such quadrupeds as whales,\r\nhippopotami, and seals or the pygopodous birds would drown in the same\r\nmanner as a dog if kept submerged long enough. The suppression of the\r\ngaseous exchange by submersion is also fatal to such aquatic insects\r\nas hydrophiles, dytiscidæ, and the like, which drown in the same\r\nmanner as the hymenoptera, coleoptera, diptera, or other terrestrial\r\ninsects. Ants drown in less than a minute when the body is wet, and\r\nthe disappearance of apparent vitality is accompanied by convulsive\r\nmovements indicating functional trouble of the nervous apparatus. Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock found that after eight hours of immersion they could be\r\nrestored to life, and several ants after two days and five days were\r\nrestored to momentary life with feeble motions, followed by death\r\nin two hours. Even a terrestrial plant when submerged drowns like a\r\nterrestrial animal, the mechanism of asphyxia by submersion being the\r\nsame in plants and aerian animals, and due to closure of the principal\r\nway of gaseous exchange.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the interruption of the gaseous exchange necessary to\r\nsupport life, there is long persistence of vitality after submersion\r\nof some creatures in which an intra-molecular respiration or gaseous\r\ndialysis with aerated water takes place, as in ants who have not been\r\nwetted before submersion.\r\n\r\nThe resistance of new-born animals to this mode of asphyxiation is\r\nespecially noted in the greater time required to drown a pup than an\r\nadult dog. One minute and a half usually suffices to drown a dog,\r\nwhile a new-born pup often requires as much as fifty minutes. This\r\ngreat difference is owing to the less active change of tissue and the\r\nsmaller consumption of oxygen in the young animal. The more active the\r\nvital combustion and the greater the demand upon the general store of\r\noxygen in the blood, the quicker the young animal perishes when the\r\nrespiration is obstructed.\r\n\r\nIt is observed in a general way that all kinds of death caused by\r\nthe privation of respirable air have between themselves the greatest\r\nresemblance. Whatever be the obstacle that intercepts the connection\r\nof the lungs with the atmosphere, the apparent differences are only\r\nsecondary and the essential symptoms are identical, because all act\r\nin suppressing the functions of the blood and hæmatosis. In fact, the\r\nphenomena of asphyxia are constant and related to disturbances in the\r\nrespiration, innervation, and circulation, which vary according as the\r\nasphyxia is the result of submersion or of the absence of oxygen in the\r\nsurrounding medium, according as asphyxia is immediate or slow. The\r\nfatal result of asphyxia is owing to the introductory arrest of the\r\npulmonary circulation, the capillaries of the lungs being incapable of\r\nconveying venous blood. The stagnation of the blood in the lungs is\r\nfollowed by paresis of the respiratory centre and stoppage of the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAGES AND SYMPTOMS OF DEATH BY DROWNING.\r\n\r\nThe authorities are that an individual who dies asphyxiated by\r\nsubmersion passes through three stages. At first he experiences a\r\nviolent shock, followed by an inspiration of surprise, which results\r\nfrom the contact of water with the lungs causing a reflex cough. Then\r\nfor some seconds there is a voluntary suspension of respiration, giving\r\nrise to other forcible involuntary expirations. In this dyspnœic second\r\nperiod the face and brain become congested, owing to slowing of the\r\nencephalic circulation. Loss of consciousness soon follows, when the\r\ndrowning person enters the third stage, which is that of asphyxia. In\r\nthis period the individual gasps deeply, the pupils are dilated, the\r\nsphincters paralyzed, and the limbs are agitated by clonic convulsions.\r\nThis is followed by complete insensibility and speedy death.\r\n\r\nWhen a fatal termination in drowning results from that form of\r\nneuro-paralysis known as _syncope_, in which death begins at the heart,\r\nwe infer from experiments that the sudden loss of consciousness arises\r\nfrom the violent impressions that the sensitive nerves convey to the\r\nbulb. Such a result is more likely to occur in persons with weak heart\r\nand languid circulation, who are more susceptible to fright and shock\r\nor to the sudden collapse from intense cold. It is also shown that\r\nstammerers, who have a defective innervation of the phrenic and of the\r\npneumogastric, succumb more rapidly than others.\r\n\r\nThe importance of syncope as a cause of death in drowning is much\r\nrestricted when we consider the fact that the circulation is the\r\nlast of the functions extinguished in an animal that for purposes of\r\nexperiment has been subjected to submersion. This has been shown in\r\na sensuous way by experiment, aided by the resources of the graphic\r\nmethod, which registers the respiratory modifications as shown by the\r\npneumograph and also the condition of the femoral artery in connection\r\nwith a kymographion. The heart continues to beat as much as three\r\nminutes after the animal has succumbed, and recent autopsy gives almost\r\nconstant proof of asphyxia. In fact, it is held that syncope takes but\r\nsmall part in this form of death, the general agreement of opinion\r\nbeing that nothing short of a syncope that would be fatal either in or\r\nout of the liquid medium can account for the entire absence of some of\r\nthe signs of death from asphyxia.\r\n\r\nAmong the symptoms often present in drowning persons, many relate to\r\nnervous phenomena and the mental state, which may vary with individual\r\npresence of mind and moral force. Persons who have escaped this kind\r\nof death have observed auditory and visual hallucinations, as flashes\r\nof light, the ringing of distant bells, and the like. Just before the\r\noutset of the asphyxiation a rather curious functioning of the brain\r\nknown as hypermnesia[936] takes place, in which the revivescence of\r\nideas, of objects, or of facts relates to anterior impressions long\r\npast that seem to have been forgotten. According to the narratives\r\nof many drowning persons who have escaped the last consequences of\r\nasphyxia, this condition was attended by general exaltation of the\r\nmemory of such a nature that their whole previous conscious existence\r\nseemed, in an incredibly short period and with great clearness and\r\nprecision, to pass before them in panoramic review. In Admiral\r\nBeaufort’s letter to Dr. Wollaston, the memory impressions are said\r\nto have occurred in retrograde succession. A medical man resuscitated\r\nfrom drowning reports that just before losing consciousness this\r\nparticular cerebral activity, in his case, took on a most realizing\r\nsense of the situation and of the consequences to his family. This\r\ncerebral superexcitement is not, however, a constant thing, nor do all\r\nsubjects experience the ineffable agony of drowning. Persons have been\r\ntaken from the water apparently dead who, on regaining consciousness,\r\ndeclared that they experienced neither oppression nor suffering and\r\nhad no recollection of what had passed. A very intelligent woman of my\r\nacquaintance, having such an experience a few years since at Newport,\r\nquotes herself as and really believes that she is an instance of a\r\nperson once dead and afterward restored to life.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar vividness of mind has been observed in other kinds\r\nof death than drowning, notably in chronic insanity. A priest with\r\nextended experience at the Government Hospital for the Insane tells me\r\nthat he has often noticed the _vaticinatio morientium_ in the form of\r\nso-called lucid interval of the insane when called on to administer\r\nthe last rites of the Church. The condition is explainable from the\r\nstoppage of the pulmonary artery and the stimulus caused by circulation\r\nof non-oxygenated blood in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe condition known as asynesia, or amnesia, sometimes follows the\r\nreturn to consciousness in persons asphyxiated and apparently dead from\r\ndrowning. Dr. F. A. Burrell reports the case of a boy of eighteen,\r\nsubmerged for six minutes and resuscitated after four and three-quarter\r\nhours, in whom the memory of everything that had occurred from half an\r\nhour previous to the accident up to return of consciousness had been\r\nentirely obliterated. When last heard from the lapse of memory still\r\nremained.[937]\r\n\r\nThe statement that death from submersion results from true asphyxia or\r\nfrom asphyxia in a more or less modified form rests on the authority\r\nof a large number of facts. Indeed, recent investigators make the\r\nproportion so much greater than formerly as to warrant the statement\r\nthat asphyxia is the generic cause of death by drowning. Dr. S. Coull\r\nMackenzie[938] reports 305 cases of drowning, in which 297, or 93.37\r\nper cent, died from asphyxiation; 1, or .32 per cent, from syncope;\r\n1, or .32 per cent, from apoplexy and asphyxia; and in 6, or 1.96 per\r\ncent, the mode of death could not be determined because of advanced\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nAs the post-mortem signs of drowning are known to vary according to\r\na number of circumstances, it is difficult to deal with the subject\r\nunless certain fundamental points be kept in mind. These relate more\r\nparticularly to the external signs and to the different lesions that\r\nfollow the mode of death, although they are not constant. Surgeon-Major\r\nE. G. Russell[939] illustrates how widely the post-mortem appearances\r\nmay vary in cases of drowning, even when the outward circumstances of\r\nthe period of death are identical and the bodies have been subjected\r\nto precisely similar conditions as regards duration of immersion,\r\nsubsequent exposure to air, and times of necropsy. He relates that\r\nfive persons were drowned while proceeding to a ship in the Hooghley\r\nRiver. Three died the same death; and at the same time the bodies\r\nwere recovered together after the same period of immersion, and were\r\nexamined together; thus from beginning to end they had been under\r\nexactly similar conditions, yet there were very marked differences\r\nin the state of preservation of the bodies and in the post-mortem\r\nappearances. After five hours’ exposure in air at 88° F., one body, in\r\nwhich the tissues were extremely fatty, showed beginning decomposition;\r\nin the other two there were no signs. Decomposition in the scalp, face,\r\nand neck indicative of drowning had begun under water, although in\r\nordinary cases it first invades the abdomen, genitals, breasts, etc.\r\nRigor mortis present in one case was absent in the other. The penis was\r\nsemi-erect in one case, flaccid in the other, retracted and shrunken in\r\nthe third. Emission of semen and expulsion of fæces were also noted.\r\nTongue not swollen or protruded in any case, and _cutis anserina_\r\nabsent in all three, which may have been owing to the high temperature.\r\nWater was inspired into the lungs in two cases. The larynx, trachea,\r\nand bronchi had regular congestion and scarlet ecchymoses in one case\r\ncharacteristic of asphyxia, and there was muddy water in the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe first question likely to arise when a drowned body has been found\r\nis the one of identity. All the circumstances in which the body was\r\nobserved before its removal to the place where it lies for examination\r\nshould therefore be minutely detailed, and all lethal injuries and the\r\nlike should be noted with care, since the smallest accessories often\r\nlead to identification. The locality in which a drowned body is found\r\nmay be a fact of considerable importance that may help to complete\r\nthe chain of evidence in which the matter of crime or of accident\r\nturns upon the question of identity. It must be remembered that bodies\r\noften drift many miles away from the spot where the drowning occurred,\r\nowing to tides or currents. Such a circumstance I noted a few years\r\nago at Brownsville, Texas, where it was a common sight to see bloated\r\ncadavers going down the Rio Grande. Time and putrefactive changes are\r\nalso elements that enter into the matter of recognizing the drowned\r\ncadaver. To resolve this question with desirable precision, the reader\r\nis referred to more detailed instruction in the chapter on Identity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF THE APPARENTLY DROWNED.\r\n\r\nHelp to the drowned does not properly come within the province of\r\njudiciary medicine, being rather a humane question that belongs to\r\npublic hygiene. Systematic writers, however, treat the subject at\r\nconsiderable length, and the statistics of institutions for helping\r\nthe drowned give such marvellous results that it would manifestly\r\nnot be out of place to cite briefly some of the means employed for\r\nrestoring life to persons taken from the water asphyxiated and\r\napparently dead.\r\n\r\nThe prime object in resuscitating the drowned is the introduction\r\nof air into the pulmonary vesicles, which is best accomplished by\r\nartificial respiration, and the employment of such means as excite\r\nthe nervous system with a view to reanimate sensibility and develop\r\nthe reflex movements that contribute to the re-establishment of the\r\nrespiratory function.\r\n\r\nThe exigencies of drowning also call for special means to restore the\r\nanimal heat and the circulation, as well as the precaution of removing\r\nmucus and fluids from the obstructed air-passages.\r\n\r\nAs the knowledge of securing patency of the air-passages by artificial\r\nrespiration is generally diffused among medical students and is taught\r\nin some schools, it would be superfluous to repeat in detail the\r\nprocedures of Hall, Sylvester, and others.\r\n\r\nLaborde’s method of resuscitating those apparently dead has lately\r\ngained some notoriety. It consists in stimulating the respiratory\r\nreflex by regular rhythmical traction of the tongue, which should\r\nbe vigorously pulled forward fifteen or eighteen times a minute, to\r\ncorrespond in frequency to the normal respiration.\r\n\r\nAnother method, alleged to have marvellous effects over the\r\nrespiration, is that of anal dilatation. Its advocates claim\r\nthat irritation of the anus is a much more effective measure in\r\nresuscitating the drowning or narcotized.[940]\r\n\r\nRespiration may be further promoted by alternate dashes of hot and cold\r\nwater on the face and chest, by smelling-salts, tickling the throat\r\nand nares with a feather, and by electrization of the diaphragm and\r\ninspiratory muscles. Protracted galvanism may, however, prove dangerous.\r\n\r\nWhen signs of life appear, a warm tonic stimulating drink should be\r\ngiven. A hypodermic injection of caffeine is also recommended.\r\n\r\nWhatever means are employed should be used on the spot in the open air\r\nand without a moment’s delay.\r\n\r\nRestorative efforts may be kept up for two or three hours, although in\r\nthe majority of cases life is extinct in the human subject after two\r\nminutes’ submersion or even less, and the chance of restoration after\r\nfive minutes’ complete submersion is doubtful. To be sure, trained tank\r\nperformers remain under water longer than two minutes, and exceptional\r\ninstances occur of recovery after twenty minutes’ submersion in\r\nindividuals in a state of syncope or with catalepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCADAVERIC SIGNS IN CASES OF DROWNING.\r\n\r\nThe signs alleged to be common to death by drowning and characteristic\r\nof it are difficult to deal with, for the reason that there are no sure\r\nsigns of drowning and the lesions furnished by necropsy are of feeble\r\nimportance. There is consequently a divergence of opinion on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL SIGNS.\r\n\r\nAmong the external diagnostic signs consistent with the supposition of\r\ndeath by drowning, the presence of froth at the mouth and nostrils is\r\nof first importance. Cadaveric rigidity, pallor, goose-skin, rosy or\r\nviolet discolorations on various parts of the body, retraction of the\r\npenis and scrotum, fish-like expression of the eye, peculiar position\r\nof the tongue, maceration of the palmar and plantar epidermis, and\r\nconvulsive contraction of the limbs, particularly of the hands, which\r\nmay be clinched after the manner that marks death by asphyxia, are all\r\nsigns which when united form strong presumption in favor of submersion.\r\n\r\nThese typical and classic signs may, however, be varied by many\r\ncircumstances. Hence the dissidence of authors. Dr. F. W. Draper states\r\nthat after inspecting 149 drowned bodies, he has never observed that\r\nimportant sign of death, the presence of substances grasped in the\r\nhands.[941] Sand or mud in the hollow of the nails and excoriations of\r\nthe fingers are also regarded as probable, not certain, signs, since\r\neach of these might have occurred either before or after death. The\r\npeculiar clinched condition of the hand is not pathognomonic, though\r\nstrongly suggestive of drowning, as it may appear in asphyxiation\r\nfrom other causes. I have lately noticed this among the external\r\nappearances of the bodies taken from the Pompeiian excavations. The\r\nfurther index of drowning known as washer-woman’s or cholera hand,\r\nwith non-adherent tendency of the epidermis, is an effect that may be\r\nproduced upon the living after a prolonged bath, notably in the aged\r\nand habitually unclean. Nor is the position of the tongue a special\r\nand distinctive characteristic of drowning. Only a few months ago I\r\nobserved its presence in some of the victims of mechanical suffocation\r\nin the Ford’s Theatre disaster in Washington.\r\n\r\nThe shrunken state of the genital organs is apparently of little\r\npositive value as a thanatological sign, since the negative and\r\nopposite state of erection has been often observed, and Dr. Ogston\r\nstates that he met semi-erection in twenty-two cases.\r\n\r\nThe value of “goose-flesh” as a link in the chain of evidence is also\r\nweakened when we consider that it frequently occurs after other violent\r\nmodes of death. Anserine skin is often met with during life, and cases\r\nof drowning are recorded where this appearance has been absent.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the face and the general position of a drowned cadaver\r\nmay likewise vary according to the mode of death. Immobility of the\r\nbody in the attitude of agony, the horrible grimaces of asphyxia, the\r\npale, calm features of syncope, and putrefactive changes are further\r\ncircumstances of medico-legal detail that may complicate the problem\r\nand render an autopsy necessary in order to invalidate or confirm the\r\nuncertain conclusions furnished by the external signs.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNAL LESIONS.\r\n\r\nAutopsies on the drowned are remarkable owing to their negative\r\nsigns. But as an extension of diagnostic means, the autopsy may show\r\nthe vertical (though not invariable) position of the epiglottis; the\r\npresence of water and foreign matter in the bronchi; swelling and\r\nemphysema of the lungs; hydræmic engorgement of the liver; fulness of\r\nthe right heart and emptiness of the left; fluidity of the blood; water\r\nin the stomach and middle ear; and a characteristic frothy mucus or\r\nlather more or less bloody, which most observers and writers consider\r\nthe only constant post-mortem appearance of drowning.\r\n\r\nExamination of the respiratory apparatus is of extreme importance in a\r\nquestion of this kind, for it is contended that the presence of foreign\r\nbodies is a proof of submersion.[942]\r\n\r\nThis opinion is in part erroneous, since it has been observed that\r\nwhen a body is submerged after death water will penetrate the larynx,\r\ntrachea, and remote bronchi, as well as the stomach and middle ear.\r\nMoreover, Dr. Ogston states that in 48.7 per cent of cases of drowning\r\nno water was found in the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe emphysematous condition of the lungs, which are said to force\r\ntheir way out of the chest on removing the sternum, is difficult to\r\ndistinguish from the result of putrefaction. Dr. Gilberti shows that in\r\nthe drowned the lungs disintegrate rapidly, while the heart, in which\r\nputrefaction begins chronologically, is relatively in a good state of\r\npreservation.[943]\r\n\r\nSince many cases have been observed in which both sides of the heart\r\nmay be partly filled or both be empty and flaccid, or the left side\r\ndistended more than the right, we are obliged to regard the exceptions\r\nconcerning this post-mortem sign of drowning as co-extensive with the\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nExcessive fluidity of the blood depends upon the rapidity with which\r\nthe drowning took place. Slight hydræmia occurs in rapid submersion,\r\nbut when the drowning has taken place slowly a large amount of water\r\npasses into the blood. In certain poisonings by opium this fluidity\r\nalso exists; but it is claimed that analysis and the spectroscope may\r\nclear up the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nHydræmic engorgement of the liver is regarded as a characteristic fact\r\nby Lacassagne, who claims to be able to diagnosticate drowning from a\r\nsingle examination of this organ.[944]\r\n\r\nIt is now generally admitted that the presence in the stomach of a\r\ncertain quantity of liquid in which the body was found immersed may be\r\nconsidered as a sign almost certain of asphyxia by submersion.\r\n\r\nDr. Fagerlund concludes from his experiments that liquids do not\r\npenetrate after death either the stomach or anus unless strong pressure\r\nbe made. But when asphyxia occurs in water the liquid is found in the\r\nstomach and the intestines, where it is helped on by peristaltic\r\nmovements. The pylorus is an obstacle to the passage of this water,\r\nthe movement of which is easier when the stomach is empty and the\r\nsubmersion prolonged.[945]\r\n\r\nThe quantity and quality of the water may constitute important\r\nevidence; but to be of full value the water or other fluid found in the\r\nstomach ought to be the same as that in which the immersion has taken\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe liquid, which may have been taken just before drowning, should\r\nnot be noticed unless it exceeds half a pint; but anything peculiar\r\nin the fluids, either of the lungs or stomach, should be subjected to\r\nmicroscopic or other examination.\r\n\r\nPresence of water in the middle ear is regarded as a thanatological\r\nsign of great value. Dr. Bourgier claims as the result of his\r\nexamination that 23 cases out of 27 had water in the middle ear.\r\nSeveral German observers pretend to have found amniotic liquid in cases\r\nof fœtal asphyxia. The fluid may be aspired by a small pipette.\r\n\r\nMany of the foregoing signs and lesions disappear or undergo variable\r\nalterations after sojourn in water, putrefaction, etc. They may, as\r\nthey have done in the past, give rise to many controversies, so that\r\npresumptions only can be established. Hence the necessity for careful\r\nand detailed necropsy in such cases, with a view not only to minimize\r\nconjecture and uncertainty, but to prevent opposing counsel from\r\nentering the plea of negligence and incompleteness.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS THE DROWNING ACCIDENTAL, SUICIDAL, OR CRIMINAL?\r\n\r\nAssuming the probabilities to be in favor of death by submersion, the\r\nquestion next turns upon the character of the event.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of lesions it is almost impossible to say whether the\r\nindividual fell in, jumped in, or was pushed in the submerging fluid.\r\nThe person’s antecedents should be inquired into—whether subject to\r\nepilepsy, vertigo, intemperance, or mental aberration. Alcoholism is\r\nan important factor in accidental drowning, and a person intoxicated\r\nmay be drowned in very shallow water. A few years ago a young man over\r\nsix feet tall, while bathing in a tributary of the Potomac River, near\r\nWashington, was drowned in only three feet of water. On considering\r\nall these circumstances, it may not be possible, even after careful\r\ninspection of the body and minute exploration of all the organs, to\r\ndeclare the drowning the consequence of an accident. The existence of\r\ntraces of violence or of injury which may have occasioned death or\r\ndisability, of such a nature as to render the person unable to defend\r\nhimself, would seem to merit particular attention. But their presence\r\nleads to further consideration—were the marks of injury caused by the\r\nwater itself, by some object in the water, or were they self-inflicted?\r\nDislocations, fractures, and other injuries have been caused by jumping\r\nor falling into the water from a great height. I know an instance of a\r\nprofessional who, on jumping from a height of ninety feet, split his\r\nupper lip on striking the water with his mouth open. The autopsy in\r\nthe case of Odlum, the Brooklyn Bridge jumper, is said to have shown\r\nrupture of the liver. On the other hand, many persons jump from great\r\nheights into water with perfect impunity. For many weeks at the London\r\nAquarium a performer has nightly jumped into a tank from an elevation\r\nof 127 feet, and several persons have successfully jumped from bridges\r\nmuch higher.\r\n\r\nObjects in the water that may account for cadaveric lesions are\r\nnumerous. I have known a soldier, a good swimmer, to break his neck\r\non diving from a river bank.[946] Other traumatic lesions may occur\r\nin a rapid current, from the breaking up of ice, from the screw or\r\npaddle-wheel of a passing steamer, or from aquatic animals.\r\n\r\nA matter much discussed in connection with this subject—that of\r\nshark-bites—may enter into the question of survivorship where it\r\nis alleged that several persons during shipwreck or other disasters\r\nat sea have been devoured by sharks. Though an occasional accident,\r\nsuch bites are more a figment of the mind than a reality, as the\r\nconcurrent testimony of disinterested observers will show. After years\r\nof investigation among nautical people and much experience as a swimmer\r\nin widely different parts of the world, I have no personal knowledge\r\nof such injuries, and have met but two persons that had any actual\r\npersonal knowledge of shark-bites.\r\n\r\nDocumentary evidence as to shark-bites is also very scanty. During the\r\nlast fifty years soldiers by the tens of thousands have swum at Fort\r\nMonroe, Virginia, yet there is no record of one having been bitten by a\r\nshark; nor have I been able to ascertain that any accident of the kind\r\nhas occurred at Malta or at Gibraltar. There does not appear to be a\r\nrecord of any one ever having been bitten off the British Isles. I have\r\nbeen unable to ascertain that a single bite of the kind is reported\r\namong the medical records of our War or Navy Department or those of\r\nthe Marine Hospital. In the West Indies but few facts are reported\r\nindicating danger from sharks, and these are not well authenticated.\r\nThe same may be said as to newspaper accounts, which deserve about as\r\nmuch credence as the reports concerning sea-serpents. A few years ago a\r\npublic journal gave an account of a boy who was bitten while swimming\r\nnear New York and afterward died in a hospital.\r\n\r\nBut medical literature has a few reports of shark-bites. After ten\r\nyears’ diligent search I have found seven references, the earliest\r\nin the _London Medical Gazette_, 1823, and the latest in the _London\r\nLancet_, 1886. The bites occurred in Australia, South Africa, and\r\nIndia. The Hooghley and Ganges Rivers are the worst place in the world\r\nfor sharks and alligators. A particular kind of shark, the _Carcharras\r\nGangeticus_, which is very fierce and bold, sometimes dashes among the\r\ncrowds at the bathing ghâts, and has been known to bite a boy in two\r\nfeet of water. All persons bitten at these places generally die from\r\nthe bite, for the reason that the shark, living on carrion, portions\r\nof which stick between the teeth, carries infection to those whom it\r\nmay afterward bite. The former habit of throwing the dead in the river\r\nis supposed to account for the boldness of these particular sharks in\r\nattacking the human species.\r\n\r\nSelf-inflicted wounds rather suggest _suicide_, as numerous instances\r\nattest, where one or two kinds of death were intended to make assurance\r\ndoubly sure. I once saw an Eskimo stab himself and then jump overboard\r\nfrom a ship off the Siberian coast. But as a rule suicidal drowning is\r\nunaccompanied by traumatic lesions, unless it be those produced by\r\nfalls. Hence the absence of lesions leads to the presumption that the\r\nindividual while living fell into the water or other fluid accidentally\r\nor voluntarily.\r\n\r\nException may be made in the case of infanticide and _homicidal_\r\nsubmersion as the result of surprise, where a person taken unawares is\r\nsuddenly and unexpectedly pushed or thrown into the water. A case in\r\npoint is that of a man suddenly robbed and seized by three persons,\r\nwho threw him into the river. Another is that of a man who, wishing to\r\nget rid of his wife, gave her arsenic. The effects of the poison being\r\nslow he induced her to take a walk along the river, and when her back\r\nwas turned he pushed her rapidly off the bank into the stream, where\r\nshe drowned. Death by submersion is rarely the result of murderous\r\nintent, and in the case of adults it is suddenly resorted to in order\r\nto paralyze resistance and facilitate the success of crime.\r\n\r\nSubmersion is oftener intended to hide a crime. A body may be taken\r\nfrom the water after murder or rape. Whether the cadaver is recent or\r\none that has lain in the water a long time, the expert is confronted\r\nwith a question of the differences that he may expect to find in a body\r\ndrowned and one thrown into the water after death. This difficulty can\r\nonly be resolved by considering all the signs and lesions furnished by\r\nthe autopsy. No single sign or post-mortem appearance is characteristic\r\nof drowning, and none enables us surely to diagnosticate death by\r\nsubmersion either in putrid or fresh cadavers. Nor do we have any\r\nsignificant infallible signs that may serve as a parallel between\r\nthe immerged post mortem and the submerged. The exterior signs being\r\nnearly the same in the two, the diagnosis must necessarily depend upon\r\nassembled circumstances, and these are liable to vary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY AFFECT THE TIME OF SUBMERSION.\r\n\r\nPutrid decomposition is the chief obstacle to diagnosis in a body\r\nthat has been drowned. This presents great differences. The death\r\nhappening in winter or summer, in a temperate or intertropical country,\r\nand sojourn of the cadaver in salt or fresh water, are each and all\r\nimportant details to be considered in studying the submergence of a\r\nbody.[947]\r\n\r\nIt is only by studying the events in this order, along with the\r\nimmediate signs of death, that the duration of the submergence may\r\nbe conjectured. With anatomical appearances as the only guide it is\r\nimpossible to fix the time of immersion. Many elements combined may\r\naffect even the gaseous putrefaction that takes place in submerged\r\nbodies. Summer heat and shallow or stagnant water hasten the\r\ndevelopment of putrid gas and subcutaneous emphysema which bring\r\nthe cadaver to the surface, and that, too, sometimes in spite of\r\nprecautions taken to insure the submersion. A case in point is the\r\nbody of the Italian admiral, Caraccioli, mentioned in Southey’s “Life\r\nof Nelson.” Bodies weighted with lead or other heavy substance for the\r\npurpose of hiding crime have also been known to float in consequence of\r\nthe putrefactive phenomena.\r\n\r\nAt Evansville, Ind., unsuccessful efforts were made to raise a sunken\r\nsteamer with thirty head of cattle between decks. A few days after\r\nthe attempt was abandoned the steamer was suddenly seen to float. The\r\ncarcasses of the putrefying animals, swollen by gas, had sufficed to\r\nbring the wreck to the surface.\r\n\r\nA great development of gas is very noticeable in what is known as a\r\n“blasted” whale, the stomach of which assumes balloon-like proportions.\r\nA few summers ago, at Provincetown, Mass., it was my rare fortune to\r\nbe within a few feet of an enormously distended putrid whale, which\r\nsuddenly exploded.\r\n\r\nIn cold countries drowned bodies are longer in coming to the surface.\r\nIn Russia, for instance, in spring after the rivers and lakes have\r\nthawed, the bodies of numerous victims of alcoholism and accidental\r\ndrowning of the previous winter are taken from the water. Last summer,\r\nat Quebec, I was present when the body of a man drowned the winter\r\nbefore came to the surface of the St. Lawrence River. On a visit to\r\nthe northern lakes many persons connected with the navigation of Lake\r\nSuperior told me that bodies drowned in its waters seldom or never came\r\nto the surface.\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity of the water itself may be an additional cause for\r\nthe body coming to the surface. Dr. Tidy says that every structure of\r\nthe human body floats in the water of the Dead Sea. The same cannot be\r\nsaid about the buoyancy of the water of Great Salt Lake, the accounts\r\nof which have been greatly exaggerated. It does not “support a bather\r\nas if he were sitting in an arm-chair and float him like a fresh egg.”\r\nExperience shows that there is no difficulty either in swimming or in\r\nsinking in its waters, the solid constituents of which are estimated to\r\nbe about six and a half times more than that of sea-water. Analysis of\r\nDead Sea water places the solid constituents at 24.580, while that of\r\nSalt Lake is 22.282. Another strong natural brine in the United States\r\nis said to be that of Syracuse Saline, New York, which contains 17.35\r\nper cent of sodium chloride.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from what has been stated that no positive assertion can\r\nbe made as to how soon a drowned body will rise to the surface, and at\r\nbest any conclusion as to the date of submersion is so unsatisfactory\r\nthat it may be said to be an unscrupulous use of guessing privileges.\r\nErrors in legal medicine are sadder in their consequences than those\r\nof medical diagnosis. The medical legist would therefore do well to\r\npreserve the frame of mind that often doubts and rarely affirms, and he\r\nshould be circumspect enough to avoid dogmatic assertions about matters\r\nof uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEATH FROM STARVATION.\r\n\r\n  IN ITS MEDICO-LEGAL ASPECT.\r\n\r\n  BY\r\n\r\n  ENOCH V.

Foods vary greatly in their\r\nproperties as restorative or constructive agencies, some containing\r\nbut few essential properties, while others combine almost all of\r\nthe elements required. As some foods contribute elements for tissue\r\nrestoration, others are specially concerned in the calorifacient\r\nactivities of the organism,[948] while others are marked in their\r\ntendency to take part, almost exclusively, in special chemical\r\nprocesses.[949]\r\n\r\nThe various articles used as foods contain nutritive elements combined\r\nwith innutritious substances. They have been variously classified, but\r\nare conveniently divided into\r\n\r\n  I. Organic foods, {_a._ Nitrogenous (C.H.O.N.).\r\n                    {_b._ Non-nitrogenous (C.H.O.), {Oleaginous\r\n                                                    {Carbohydrates.\r\n\r\n  II. Inorganic foods, {_a._ Water, H_{2}O.\r\n                       {_b._ Saline substances.\r\n\r\nNitrogen enters largely into the composition of the body, and hence\r\nmust be abundantly supplied and in combination.\r\n\r\nOf the non-nitrogenous elements the most important are _fat_, _sugar_,\r\nand _starch_.\r\n\r\nThe _inorganic_ principles are essential to the process of nutrition.\r\n_Water_, constituting 87 per cent of the bulk of the body, is demanded\r\nin constant supply; while the _saline substances_ are necessary for the\r\nperfect performance of many of its chemical processes.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that no single element can alone carry on the nutrition\r\nof the body, and hence _variety_ in the supply of food, as well as\r\nsufficiency in its quantity, is essential to normal nutrition. Nor are\r\nthese the only factors in this complex problem. Proper preparation of\r\nfood, its supply at necessary temperatures,[950] and other requirements\r\nenter into the question of normal or sufficient alimentation.[951]\r\n\r\nAlimentation is sufficient when it is so regulated that all the\r\nfunctions of the body are performed in a complete and regular manner.\r\nInsufficient alimentation induces a series of phenomena and a result\r\nwhich have been designated “_inanition_,” or “starvation.”\r\n\r\nThe exact amount of aliment required by each individual can only\r\nbe stated in a general way. In the circumstances in which he is\r\nplaced, the supply must be of such character and quantity as shall be\r\nproportionate to the constructive and reparative needs of his body.\r\nIt is possible, however, to state a mean for the various ages and\r\noccupations of life.\r\n\r\nPhysiologists generally agree that in ordinary conditions of exercise\r\nthe following represents the amounts of the several food elements\r\nnecessary for the adult individual daily:\r\n\r\n  Albuminous substances  120 gms. = 4 oz.\r\n  Fatty substances        60  ”   = 2  ”\r\n  Carbohydrates          360  ”   =12  ”\r\n\r\nTaking the fatty matters as the unit, the daily allowance would bear\r\nthe following proportions:\r\n\r\nFats, 1; albuminoids, 2; carbohydrates, 6.\r\n\r\nThese quantities and especially the fats and carbohydrates, in\r\nconditions of hard muscular labor, must be increased; and the\r\nproportion would then stand:\r\n\r\nFats, 1; albuminoids, 1.7; carbohydrates, 7.\r\n\r\nThe division of this amount of food elements into proper portions\r\nduring twenty-four hours is important. This must be regulated by the\r\nhabits and other circumstances of the individual.[952]\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of death solely from privation of food is comparatively\r\nrare; yet it is sufficiently frequent to be considered as one of\r\nthe causes of violent death and to demand investigation, since\r\ncircumstances may be such as to constitute a homicide from criminal\r\nneglect or a suicide from intentional abstinence from food.\r\n\r\n“=Starvation=,” or “=inanition=,” may be considered as being _acute_\r\nor _chronic_ according as the requisite food has been suddenly and\r\ncompletely or gradually withheld.\r\n\r\n\r\nACUTE STARVATION.\r\n\r\nThe complete deprivation of food induces a series of modifications of\r\nthe functions of the body, differing somewhat from those developed by\r\na partial and prolonged deprivation. The length of time during which\r\ncomplete absence of food can be endured varies with circumstances.\r\nIn absolute stoppage of the food supply the acute sensations of\r\nhunger pass away after the first one or two days, and are succeeded\r\nby profound functional disturbances with weakness and depressing\r\nsensations over the epigastric region, accompanied by distressing\r\nthirst.[953] The mouth is dry and the tongue heavily coated; the breath\r\nis fetid; the skin is harsh, dry, and exhales a disagreeable odor; the\r\nfeces become more and more scanty until the latter days of life, when\r\ndiarrhœa usually supervenes; the face and extremities become rapidly\r\nemaciated; the person walks with a weak and tottering gait;[954] the\r\nurine is small in quantity and very acid; muscular feebleness gradually\r\nreaches complete inability to move; ringing in the ears, insomnia and,\r\nin some cases, hallucinations[955] with delirium and convulsions\r\nprecede death, though these latter symptoms are not uniformly\r\nobserved.[956]\r\n\r\n\r\n“CHRONIC STARVATION,” “CHRONIC INANITION.”\r\n\r\nThis form of starvation, met with most extensively during the\r\nprevalence of famine, also occurs in conditions demanding legal\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n=The symptoms= are sufficiently constant and characteristic. Emaciation\r\nbecomes extreme, the skin dry and rough, exhaling a disagreeable odor\r\nand often covered with a coating not entirely attributable to filth;\r\nthe breath is fetid and offensive. With some exceptions, the victim\r\nretains his consciousness and ability to move about, muscular efforts\r\nbecoming more and more feeble; the voice becomes faint; the evacuations\r\ninfrequent, dry and dark; the urine scanty and high-colored, death\r\noccurring suddenly at the end, with delirium in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe length of time during which these symptoms are developed and their\r\nintensity depend mainly upon the amount and character of the aliment\r\nactually supplied during the period before death.\r\n\r\nUpon the PULSE and CIRCULATION the effects of starvation are manifest\r\nin increased frequency and feebleness of the cardiac contractions and\r\nlessened force of the cardiac impulse; this is more and more marked\r\nas the anæmic condition becomes profound. In some cases the pulse is\r\ngreatly reduced in frequency, as well as in force, dropping as low as\r\nthirty-seven beats in the minute,[957] and auscultation reveals the\r\nexistence of cardiac bruits.\r\n\r\nIn connection with enfeeblement of the circulation, a tendency to\r\nhemorrhagic conditions is common, with purpuric and petechial eruptions\r\nin some cases.\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE.—A subnormal temperature is frequently noted in the\r\nprogress of chronic wasting disease. In inanition, which in some\r\nrespects induces a similarly profound disturbance of the functions\r\nof nutrition, an analogous lowering of the body temperature occurs.\r\nChossat clearly shows in his experiments the influence of starvation in\r\ndepressing the body temperature. This abasement of temperature does not\r\nremain constant, but daily oscillations appear, differing from those\r\noccurring in conditions of normal alimentation.\r\n\r\nWhile the normal diurnal variation in the fully nourished is about 0.3°\r\nto 1.0° C. (0.5° to 1.7° F.), in the starving this variation reaches\r\n3.28­­° C. (5.4° F.). This rises to nearly double this amount during\r\nthe latter days of life, and is greatly increased above this figure\r\nduring the day preceding death. The temperature at the close falls to a\r\nmean of 24.9° C. (76° F.), and at the moment of death has been noted at\r\n18.5° C. (66° F.).\r\n\r\nEMACIATION.—Loss of weight is the most striking and constant symptom\r\nof starvation. The rapidity of its production and its extent are\r\nmodified by circumstances. A very considerable loss of weight can be\r\nsustained by the ordinary individual without a fatal result.\r\n\r\nChossat[958] fully demonstrated the effects of inanition upon the\r\nvarious functions and organs of the body in animals, and has drawn the\r\nconclusion that a loss of weight exceeding four-tenths of the entire\r\nweight of the body is productive of a fatal result. These deductions\r\nmay be adopted as applicable to the human species. This statement must\r\nbe accepted as a mean, as it is capable of variation by circumstances,\r\nsuch as age, obesity, etc.\r\n\r\nDeath may occur before so great a loss has been reached in some cases,\r\nand in the obese the fat may disappear entirely and cause a loss\r\nreaching five per cent of the entire weight of the body, in a very fat\r\nanimal, without a fatal result.\r\n\r\nBouchardat[959] considers that the important question is the extent\r\nto which the blood and organs of the body contribute to this loss of\r\nweight. Impoverishment of the blood by inanition, which at the time of\r\ndeath has been found to amount to six-tenths of its solid constituents,\r\nis one of the most vitally serious elements of this loss; and a\r\nrelative increase of its watery portion appears, without regard to the\r\nemployment of water as a beverage.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that in wasting diseases extreme emaciation may\r\noccur under a liberal diet, and may continue for a considerable time\r\nbefore death.[960]\r\n\r\n_The muscular system_ becomes greatly enfeebled, atrophied, and unable\r\nto perform its functions; the loss sustained by the muscles least used\r\nbeing most marked. The extent of muscular power possible in starvation\r\nvaries in different individuals and in various circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe vigorous and healthy adult, as a rule, retains muscular power to a\r\ngreater extent and for a longer period than the child or aged person,\r\nunder similar circumstances.\r\n\r\nExposure to a rigorous climate, prolonged fatigue, etc., rapidly reduce\r\ncapacity for muscular effort in conditions of inanition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD AT WHICH DEATH OCCURS.\r\n\r\nThis is influenced by many circumstances. It is difficult to fix an\r\nexact period for the duration of life in complete deprivation of food,\r\nor acute starvation, and it is certainly more so in chronic inanition,\r\nwhen the modifying circumstances are increased in number and complexity.\r\n\r\nA large number of cases of prolongation of life during a period of\r\nabsolute deprivation of food which has been stated to extend over weeks\r\nand even months, cannot be accepted as free from error, and hence are\r\nnot considered here.\r\n\r\nA sufficient number, accurately observed and well attested by\r\nunimpeachable authorities, have led to the conclusion that the healthy\r\nadult, in a total deprivation of food, can exist for a period not\r\nexceeding ten to twelve days. On one of the Inman line of steamers, a\r\nyoung man, aged twenty years, endured absolute deprivation of all food\r\nand water during eleven days, recovery following.[961]\r\n\r\nSarah Jacobs, a child of thirteen years (“the Welsh fasting girl”), had\r\nbeen exhibited by her parents as a miraculous being under the pretence\r\nthat she had eaten nothing during _two years_.\r\n\r\nThe child being placed under complete surveillance by four nurses from\r\nGuy’s Hospital for eight days, during which period no food was taken,\r\ndied on the ninth day.\r\n\r\nThe post-mortem examination showed all organs of the body to be in a\r\nhealthy condition. The stomach was empty, with the exception of three\r\nteaspoonfuls of a thin acid fluid. The intestines were also empty and\r\ntheir walls were not thinned. A layer of fat, half an inch or more in\r\nthickness, was found under the skin of the chest and abdomen. The liver\r\nwas in a healthy condition, as also the kidneys and spleen. The bladder\r\nwas empty.\r\n\r\nThe parents were tried on a charge of manslaughter and were convicted\r\nof causing death by criminal negligence.[962]\r\n\r\nCaspar gives the details of a case observed by him of a man aged\r\nthirty-six years, who endured total abstinence from all food for eleven\r\ndays, recovery following.[963]\r\n\r\nCases are reported of miners who have been imprisoned by accidents\r\nin mines for eight, nine, and nine and one-half days, with recovery\r\nfollowing rescue at the end of this time.[964]\r\n\r\nWhile the period stated may serve as a maximum limit to which life may\r\nbe extended in acute starvation, there are circumstances which must be\r\nconsidered as modifying this.\r\n\r\n=Body Condition.=—It need hardly be stated that the individual in\r\nperfect health can sustain complete inanition longer than the enfeebled\r\nor diseased. The presence or absence of _fat_ modifies considerably the\r\npower of endurance.\r\n\r\n=Age.=—Infants bear starvation badly and succumb more quickly than the\r\nadult. The aged, while they bear a moderate amount of food better than\r\nthe young adult, do not endure a complete deprivation for so long a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n=Cold.=—The depressing influence of cold upon the vital functions,\r\nespecially in the young and feeble, renders it a powerful factor in\r\nshortening the duration of life in starvation.\r\n\r\n=The Supply of Water.=—When all food is withheld, free use of water\r\nas a drink tends to increase the length of the interval before death.\r\nIn several cases of protracted fasting, the use of water in moderate\r\namount has been resorted to with the apparent result of amelioration\r\nof some of the distressing symptoms and lengthening the period of\r\nendurance.\r\n\r\nDr. Tanner, a physician, attempted in July and August, 1880, at New\r\nYork, a complete fast of forty days’ duration, with the exception\r\nof the free use of water. In this case absolute abstinence from all\r\nnourishment is questioned, as no strict medical surveillance was\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Succi, at New York, in 1890, undertook a voluntary\r\nabstinence from food for forty days, under surveillance, with the use\r\nof simple liquids and of some narcotic substance. He completed the\r\nfast, but beyond this fact the case is without scientific value.\r\n\r\n=Catalepsy.=—Certain abnormal conditions of the nervous system are\r\nmet where the activity of the vital functions is very considerably\r\nlowered and the various processes of the economy are in a condition\r\nof semi-suspension. Cases of this character have been observed where\r\nthe supply of food has been almost entirely suspended for a period\r\nof several days, with but little emaciation and other symptoms\r\ncharacteristic of inanition.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS STARVATION ACCOMPANIED BY OTHER ILL TREATMENT?\r\n\r\nThis question may arise where evidences of starvation are apparent.\r\n\r\nSuch cases are met among young children neglected or abused by parents\r\nor those in whose care they may have been placed, or among the\r\nalienated or sick in the care of cruel or unsympathetic attendants.\r\n\r\nInfants placed with “wet-nurses” or found in the so-called “baby farms”\r\nalso furnish cases which fall under this head.\r\n\r\nA careful examination into the collateral circumstances of the case,\r\ntogether with the results of a careful post-mortem examination, usually\r\nrender a positive answer to this question possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nThe dead body exhibits appearances quite characteristic.\r\n\r\n=Emaciation= is very marked and sometimes reaches an extraordinary\r\ndegree, surpassing that of prolonged and wasting diseases.\r\n\r\nIn extreme cases the fat entirely disappears throughout the body;\r\nthe omentum and mesentery are entirely devoid of it, as well as the\r\nsubcutaneous and intermuscular cellular tissue. The muscles are\r\natrophied and the _heart_ is sometimes considerably reduced in size;\r\nthe liver and kidneys in some cases show great reduction of volume. The\r\nspleen also is small and often softened.\r\n\r\nThe =stomach= and =intestines= usually display an extensive thinning\r\nof their walls, so much so that their contents may be distinguished\r\nthrough them; their calibre also is frequently found to be diminished,\r\nthough occasionally they may be distended with gas. Usually they are\r\nempty, or contain only a small quantity of bile and fecal matter. In\r\nsome cases various foreign substances which have been swallowed by the\r\nvictims to appease hunger have been found in them.\r\n\r\nThe thinning of the walls, so constantly noted, has been considered as\r\na specially characteristic symptom of starvation.[965]\r\n\r\nThe congestion, softening, and ulcerations which have been observed\r\nin some cases cannot be considered as evidences of starvation or as\r\nits results, but rather as being due to an enteritis induced by the\r\ningestion of improper substances.\r\n\r\nThe =gall bladder= is usually found filled with dark and inspissated\r\nbile. In death by starvation the entire organs of the body exhibit no\r\nspecific form of disease. Evidences of the existence of an organic\r\naffection observed in the post-mortem examination at once raise the\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS DEATH CAUSED BY STARVATION OR DISEASE?\r\n\r\nWas the original disease aggravated by a failure to supply the patient\r\nwith food, or are the lesions observed the result of starvation?\r\nA positive conclusion can be reached in such cases by carefully\r\nconsidering the results of a post-mortem examination together with\r\nother facts elicited by the inquiry.\r\n\r\nHarriet Staunton,[966] a young girl, had been kept in close confinement\r\nby four interested persons, and removed in great haste, when in a\r\ncondition of extreme prostration, to Penge, where she died, on the\r\nday succeeding her removal, in a state of extreme exhaustion and\r\nemaciation. Fat was absent from every part of the body; the stomach and\r\nintestines were empty, contracted, and their walls were greatly thinned.\r\n\r\nA small deposit of tubercle was found at the summit of the left lung\r\nand a recent deposit of miliary tubercle beneath the arachnoid, upon\r\nthe surface of one of the cerebral hemispheres. No other tuberculous\r\ndeposits were found. The opinion given by the physicians making the\r\npost-mortem examination was that death resulted from starvation. This\r\nopinion was shared by Professor Virchow, of Berlin, who stated that the\r\ntuberculous deposits found could not explain the cause of death.\r\n\r\nIn this case the extreme emaciation, entire absence of fat, thinning\r\nof the intestinal walls, etc., were the determining conditions. While\r\nextreme emaciation alone is not sufficient to decide the case to be\r\none of starvation, its existence, taken in connection with some of\r\nthe conditions found constantly in persons known to have died of\r\nstarvation, is a strongly corroborative fact. Nor can its absence be\r\ntaken as conclusive evidence that death occurred from other cause than\r\nstarvation, since in some cases of death from inanition emaciation has\r\nnot been extreme and in a few cases not at all marked.[967] Instances\r\nof this character are reported by Taylor and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES PRODUCED BY STARVATION.\r\n\r\nThe effect of insufficient alimentation in the production of disease\r\nhas long been recognized. It is understood that this result follows the\r\ndeficiency in either quality or quantity. The so-called “famine fever,”\r\nprevalent in times of dearth, has afforded extensive opportunity for\r\nobservation of the effects produced. The symptoms developed are those\r\ndirectly referable to impoverishment of the blood. Pallor, emaciation,\r\nnervous depression, derangement of the digestive organs, and muscular\r\nenfeeblement appear in every case.\r\n\r\nThe development of strumous, herpetic, and cutaneous diseases generally\r\nis marked.\r\n\r\nOf the secondary effects, the cachectic condition induced expresses\r\nitself in pulmonary phthisis largely, while in infants and very young\r\nchildren intestinal disorders are specially frequent. Organic diseases\r\nalready existing are seriously aggravated; wounds fail to heal, become\r\nulcerative and sometimes gangrenous; while all degenerative processes\r\nare rapidly hastened to a fatal issue.[968]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ABDOMEN, contusions of, 580\r\n    post-mortem examination of, 370\r\n    wounds of, 580\r\n\r\n  ABDOMINAL VISCERA,

It was recognized by the father of medico-legal science,\r\nZacchias, in his two prefaces, one to the “lector medicus,” the other\r\nto the “lector legumperitus” (“Quæst. Med. Leg.,” Ed. Venet., 1727,\r\nfol.). In a note to the introduction of the “Medical Jurisprudence”\r\nof Dr. Paris and Mr. Fonblanque (the first work produced by joint\r\nauthorship of a physician and a lawyer, in 1823) is the following (p.\r\ni.): “Some authors have objected to the term _Medical Jurisprudence_\r\nas implying a knowledge of the laws relating to medical topics, rather\r\nthan an acquaintance with the medical science necessary for the\r\nelucidation of legal subjects. As it is our peculiar object to unite\r\nthe sciences and to show their mutual relevance, the title becomes most\r\napplicable to this, although it may have been improperly affixed to\r\nformer works.” The title of one of two existing French works in whose\r\nauthorship a lawyer is associated is: “Traité de Médecine légale, de\r\nJurisprudence médicale et de Toxicologie,” par Le Grand du Saulle, Geo.\r\nBerryer et Gab. Pouchet, 2d ed., 8vo, Paris, 1886.\r\n\r\n[2] “Bibl.

It contains no statement bearing\r\nupon our subject. It is, however, simply a collection of descriptions\r\nof remedies, and their uses, including the incantations to be used with\r\nthem. (See “Papyros Ebers,” H. Joachim, Berlin. 1890.) The same is true\r\nof the Berlin and Leyden papyri. The Bibl. Nat. (Tf. 2) possesses a\r\nChinese manuscript on legal medicine. The catalogue does not, however,\r\nstate to what period it belongs.\r\n\r\n[6] For an account of early Indian medicine, see Th. A.

In\r\nthe Attic courts the testimony was taken at a preliminary trial, and\r\nreferred to at the trial by the orator.\r\n\r\n[16] “Oratores Attici,” C.

Smith _v._ Lane, 24 Hun (New York Supreme\r\nCourt), 32.\r\n\r\n[156] Analysis of this decision shows that the main ground, upon\r\nwhich the court of last resort sustained the right of the applicant\r\nfor admission to be admitted as a member of the society, was, that\r\nthe provisions of the by-law in question were not specifically made\r\napplicable to a person applying for membership. The Court observed,\r\npp. 192 _et seq._: “The regulations embodied in the so-called code are\r\nadmirably framed, and commend themselves to every reader, as tending\r\nto raise to a still higher elevation the character of the learned\r\nand honorable profession to which they were submitted for approval\r\nand adoption. They are not limited in their scope to the range of\r\nmoral obligation, but embrace express rules of conduct, in personal,\r\nprofessional, and public relations. They are regulations in the\r\nvarious departments of morals and manners, of courtesy and etiquette,\r\nof delicacy and honor. They bind those who pledge themselves to their\r\nobservance, but cannot be recognized in law, as conditions precedent to\r\nthe exercise of an honorable profession, by learned, able, and upright\r\nmen, who have not agreed to abide by them. The non-observance of such\r\nregulations _may be made_ cause for exclusion or disfranchisement; but\r\nit must be either by the agreement of parties or by the exercise of the\r\nlaw-making power.\r\n\r\n“The applicant was not a member either of the American Medical\r\nAssociation or of the Erie County Medical Society, at the time of his\r\nalleged deviation from the formulas prescribed by these conventional\r\nrules. He was under no legal obligation to observe them, and had\r\nneither actual nor constructive notice of their existence. Those\r\nwho were _members_ of the society could not lawfully be expelled\r\nfor _antecedent_ deviation from the code (Fawcett _v._ Charles, 13\r\nWend., 477). Much less could such deviation be alleged, as cause for\r\nexclusion, against one who had never agreed to be bound by it, and as\r\nto whom it was not merely an inoperative but an unknown law.\r\n\r\n“As the relator demanded admission to the enjoyment of a franchise to\r\nwhich he was presumptively entitled, his exclusion could be justified\r\nonly by facts repelling the presumption that he was duly qualified for\r\nadmission, or by extraneous facts, showing that, if his application was\r\ngranted, there were then subsisting causes, making ‘a clear case’ for\r\nimmediate expulsion (_Ex parte_ Paine, 1 Hill, 665).\r\n\r\n“The burden was upon the appellant to establish affirmatively the\r\nexistence of such present cause for expulsion. The society waived the\r\nright of making a return and taking a formal issue on the claim of\r\nthe relator, to be determined as matter of fact by a jury, under the\r\ndirection of the court; but submitted its objections in the form of\r\naffidavits, which failed to establish cause either for exclusion or\r\nexpulsion.\r\n\r\n“The only _specific fact_ alleged in the opposing affidavits, as ground\r\nof objection, was the publication by the relator of a professional\r\nadvertisement, which was inserted in one or more of the Buffalo\r\njournals in May, 1855, and discontinued in January, 1857, more than\r\ntwo years before his application was presented. It is charged that the\r\nprinting of this notice was an empiricism, and in conflict with the\r\ncode of ethics adopted by the Erie County Medical Society.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing in the terms of the advertisement from which\r\nany inference can justly be drawn against the relator, in respect\r\neither to his personal character or his professional skill. There\r\nis no suggestion, in the affidavits, that any of the statements of\r\nfact contained in the notice are untrue, and there is nothing in\r\nits contents inconsistent with perfect good faith on the part of\r\nthe relator. It refers to the treatment of bronchitis, asthma, and\r\nconsumption, as a special department of the profession to which he\r\nhad directed his particular attention; and it alludes to his use of\r\nthe method recently introduced, of medicated inhalation, through\r\nan instrument appropriate to that purpose, in aid of such general\r\ntreatment as experience had proved to be beneficial in that class of\r\ndiseases. It is not denied that the relator possessed peculiar skill\r\nin this department of the profession; and the case discloses the fact\r\nthat the method of auxiliary treatment, introduced by him in the\r\ncounty of Erie, was not only successful in his own practice, but was\r\nadopted, with beneficial results, by members of the county society\r\nof high professional standing, and that it was accepted by a large\r\nproportion of the physicians of Western New York. If, at the time this\r\nremedy was introduced, he had been a member of the County Society or\r\nof the American Medical Association, he would not have been at liberty\r\nto direct attention, through the medium of the public journals, to\r\nthe benefits resulting from its use. This would, perhaps, have been\r\nunfortunate for those who were suffering, in that vicinity, from this\r\nparticular class of diseases; but it is undoubtedly true that the\r\nsuppression of such an advertisement would have been more considerate\r\ntoward his professional brethren, and more in accordance with the\r\nrules of delicacy and good taste. But an error, in this respect, by\r\none who had no notice of the society regulation is not cause for\r\ndisfranchisement. The act of the relator was neither immoral nor\r\nillegal. It was no violation of the by-laws; for, as to him, they were\r\nwholly inoperative. It was no present cause for _exclusion_; for the\r\npublication of the objectionable notice had been discontinued for more\r\nthan two years. When he applied for admission, he proposed to become\r\nbound by the by-laws; and this the society refused to permit, for the\r\nsole cause that he had not observed them before they became rules of\r\nconduct for him. ‘Where there is no law, there is no transgression.’\r\nThe relator, therefore, had been guilty of no legal wrong which could\r\nbar his claim to the franchise.”\r\n\r\n[157] In Macpherson _v._ Cheadell (24 Wend., N. Y., 15) the Court said,\r\np. 24:\r\n\r\n“In the first place I doubt much whether the defendant below, after\r\nretaining the plaintiff as a physician and accepting his services as\r\nsuch, could call upon him in the first instance to prove a regular\r\nlicense. In other like cases, the presumption is against the defendant.\r\nIt is so as between attorney and client, in a suit for services\r\nperformed under a retainer. Pearce _v._ Whale, 7 Donl. & Ryl., 512,\r\n515, per Bayley, Judge; 5 Barn. _v_. Cress., 38, S. C. There, if the\r\nobjection sound in the fact that the plaintiff was never admitted, or\r\nthat his admission has become inoperative, it lies with the defendant\r\nto show it. _Id._, and see Berryman _v._ Wise, 44 T. R., 566. and other\r\ncases; 1 Phil. Ev., 227, Cowen _v._ Hill’s ed. Besides, the contrary\r\nwould be doing great violence to the presumption that no man will\r\ntransgress the command of a positive law.” See also Thompson _v._ Sayre\r\n(1 Denio, N. Y., 75), where this principle seems to have been assumed\r\nas correct without question upon the strength of the decision quoted\r\nabove. A similar doctrine appears to have been enunciated in the State\r\nof Illinois in Chicago _v._ Wood, 24 Ill. App., 42; and Williams _v._\r\nPeople, 20 Ill. App., 92. It may be sound, and undoubtedly the English\r\ncases cited in Macpherson _v._ Cheadell, _supra_, tend to support it.\r\nBut in a case in which the physician’s right to practise is denied,\r\nthe safe course will be for him to have a duly authenticated copy of\r\nhis license ready to be offered in evidence. The general rule is that\r\nthe burden is on the plaintiff to show all the facts which make up his\r\nright of recovery. See Bliss _v._ Brainard, 41 N. H., 256; Salomon _v._\r\nDreschler, 4 Minn., 278; Kane _v._ Johnston, 9 Bosw., N. Y. Superior\r\nCt., 154.\r\n\r\n[158] That is, the burden devolves upon the defendant, and this\r\nnotwithstanding the presumption of innocence, of showing what must be\r\npeculiarly within his own knowledge, namely, that he has been duly\r\nlicensed. People _v._ Nyce, 34 Hun, N. Y., 298, and cases cited; 1\r\nGreenleaf on Ev., § 79, and cases cited. See, contra, State _v._ Evans,\r\n5 Jones. N. C., 250.\r\n\r\n[159] In Finch _v._ Gridley’s Executors (25 Wend., N. Y., 469-471),\r\nNelson, Ch. J., said: “I am also inclined to think the evidence which\r\nwas given competent to prove the _diploma_ from Fairfield College.\r\nThe witness identified the corporate seal, _and had himself received\r\na diploma from that institution subscribed by the same president and\r\nsecretary_. Though he did not actually see them subscribe the paper,\r\nhe had every means of becoming acquainted with their signatures; _the\r\ndelivery_ of it to him was an acknowledgment they had signed it.\r\nBesides, he was familiar with diplomas from the institution under their\r\nsignature,” etc.\r\n\r\nAnd see, also, Raynor _v._ State, 62 Wis., 289; Wendel _v._ State,\r\n_id._, 300.\r\n\r\n[160] In some of the States, persons who simply administered roots and\r\nherbs in treating disease, have been excepted from that portion of the\r\nstatute which forbids the practice of medicine and surgery without a\r\nlicense. The proper construction of such an exception is, that it is a\r\nquestion of fact for the jury, whether the person accused who claims\r\nthe benefit of the exception, simply administered a concoction of roots\r\nand herbs within the meaning of the statute, or whether, under the\r\nguise of so doing, he really held himself out as and acted as a regular\r\npractitioner. All such penal statutes are to be construed, like all\r\nother penal statutes, with due regard to the rights of the individual,\r\nand at the same time with such degree of liberality as will tend to\r\npreserve the public safety.\r\n\r\n[161] It has been held that the act of a physician in reporting to\r\na health-board in good faith that his patient is suffering from\r\nsmall-pox, is not actionable. Brown _v._ Purdy, 8 N. Y. St. Rep.,\r\n143. The Court said (per Sedgwick, J.): “In order to give the public\r\nthe protection due to it, according to the intention of the statute,\r\nany physician that possesses in fact an opinion that a patient has a\r\ncontagious disease, is bound to report the case, _whether he has_ or\r\n_has not_ used ordinary professional skill and knowledge. A physician\r\nof skill in everything but cases of small-pox, which happily are not\r\nnumerous, may, unexpectedly to himself, be called to a case which\r\npresents to him the appearance of small-pox. It may be said that\r\nhe may call in counsel. It cannot, however, be said that private\r\ncounsel should be called in rather than such as the law has appointed.\r\nCertainly, if he really thinks the case to be one of small-pox, it\r\nis his duty to communicate his opinion to the public authorities,\r\nwho furnish skilled physicians peculiarly competent to pass upon the\r\ncase. They are the experts the law points out for the physician. The\r\nattendance of these experts upon a patient can cause no injury, and\r\nthereafter the responsibility rests solely upon the public officer.”\r\n\r\nAs to how far the decision of an inspector appointed by a board\r\nof health is regarded by the law as quasi-judicial, and therefore\r\nconclusive, see Underwood _v._ Green, 42 N. Y., 140; Raymond _v._ Fish,\r\n51 Conn., 80. Health officers who were guilty of gross negligence in\r\nremoving infected persons from a city in stormy weather, and putting\r\nthem in an unprotected and unsafe structure, so that such persons died\r\nfrom the exposure, have been held liable.

In Missouri the power to license physicians is\r\nconferred upon the State Board of Health, and the Supreme Court of that\r\nState has held that the act of that board in granting or refusing a\r\nlicense is discretionary and its action in such a matter will not be\r\nenforced by a writ of _mandamus_ (State _v._ Gregory, 83 Mo., 123); and\r\na similar doctrine prevails in Minnesota, State _v._ State Med. Board,\r\n32 Minn., 324. The latest and best work on the general subject of the\r\norganization and powers of boards of health is Parker & Worthington’s\r\n“Public Health and Safety,” M.

The general rule is that\r\nin an action arising on contract damages arising for a tort cannot be\r\nset up as a counter-claim. It follows from this that in an action of a\r\nphysician for services, damages for malpractice could not be recouped\r\nor counter-claimed ordinarily. The way in which that rule is avoided,\r\nand the safer method, is for the defendant to plead that it was part\r\nof the contract of the physician (which it undoubtedly is), to perform\r\nhis services in a faithful and skilful manner, and that he committed a\r\nbreach of it, thus charging the damages which flowed from his acts as\r\na breach of contract, not as a cause of action in tort for malpractice\r\nor negligence. If that is done the counter-claim arising in malpractice\r\ncan probably be pleaded in an action for services, and possibly\r\na counter-claim in excess of the amount claimed by the physician\r\nrecovered as an affirmative judgment against him. On the other hand, in\r\nan action for malpractice brought by the patient against a physician,\r\nwhich is generally in form an action for a tortious act, or neglect,\r\nthe physician cannot plead the performance of services and the\r\nnon-payment of his bill as a counter-claim or recoupment, because that\r\narises on a contract. If there is any exception to this rule it will be\r\nfound to grow out of the language of sections 549 and 550 of the Code\r\nof Civil Procedure of the State of New York, and of similar enactments\r\nin other States, which permit counter-claims arising out of the same\r\nsubject-matter as the cause of action, to be pleaded in that action. In\r\nNew York State, however, any effect of that kind is negatived by the\r\ngeneral provision that the actions must not only arise out of the same\r\nsubject-matter but be of the same kind and class.\r\n\r\n[178] The degree of care and skill required to be shown to entitle\r\nthe physician or surgeon to recover compensation for his services has\r\nalready been stated to be simply such care and skill as are possessed\r\nby the majority of other professional men of the same school of\r\npractice at the time, or what is known as ordinary care and skill.\r\n\r\n[179] Foster _v._ Coleman, 1 E.

Y., Bar, and\r\nhis admirable lectures on Medical Jurisprudence before the Medical\r\nDepartment of the University of Buffalo.\r\n\r\n[181] The conservatism of lawyers is proverbial. It is hard to convince\r\nthem that forms that have been long in use and have been found to serve\r\na useful purpose in the past, are not applicable to new conditions as\r\nthey arise; for instance, that the methods of procuring the attendance\r\nand of examining ordinary witnesses do not fit the necessities of\r\nexpert testimony. But the question as to the defects of the system as\r\nit now exists has been brought to public attention in the journals of\r\nthe day, in papers read before medical societies and bar associations,\r\nand in arguments in legislative bodies, and it is hoped and believed\r\nthat ere long a reform, something of the character indicated, may be\r\nbrought about in this very important matter.\r\n\r\n[182] It has been a matter of great discussion whether an expert is\r\ncompellable to testify on matters of opinion, without compensation,\r\nthe weight of the decisions being that he is not bound to do so. 1\r\nGreenleaf on Evidence, § 310; 1 Warwick Law Assizes, 158; Parkinson\r\n_v._ Atkinson, 31 L.

Pollock _v._ Gregory, 9 Bosworth, N. Y.\r\nSuperior Ct. Rep., 121-124.\r\n\r\n[183] This latter case holds that a second expert may be called to\r\ntestify after the first has been thus challenged, to support his\r\ncapacity and skill. The contrary rule, however, obtains in Alabama\r\n(Tellis _v._ Kidd., 12 Ala., 643; Pugh _v._ State, 44 Ala., 33).\r\nNeither can an expert be contradicted by books of science; that is, by\r\nbooks of science introduced in evidence as such (Wharton on Evidence,\r\n666, 721). This is so because the rule is well established that books,\r\nalthough of great authority in themselves, may not, even if proven\r\nto be such, be placed in evidence. They may, however, be read to\r\nthe witness, and so be placed upon the record, passage by passage,\r\nand the witness may be asked whether he agrees with that doctrine,\r\nnot, however, as part of his direct examination, but as part of his\r\ncross-examination.\r\n\r\nA medical expert is sometimes confronted upon the witness-stand by long\r\nquotations from well known medical text-books, and he is asked whether\r\nthe doctrines, opinions, etc., there laid down are sound. Especially is\r\nthis done when such doctrines and opinions are in apparent discord with\r\nhis evidence as he gives it. In such cases as this, however honest,\r\nhowever intelligent and non-partisan the witness may be (except as\r\nany opinion on one side or the other of a disputed question may be\r\nconsidered partisan), he is placed in a very difficult position. If\r\nthe citations and questions are from well-known authors, and he is\r\na modest man, as most men of learning are, it will be difficult for\r\nhim to deny that such authorities as these have great weight, even\r\nmore weight than his experience, skill, and knowledge entitle him to\r\nclaim. On the other hand, if he takes the bold course and sticks to his\r\nopinion, he is cried down the winds by counsel in summing him up, as a\r\nman of gall, boldness, audacity and egotism. His course is difficult\r\nwhichever way he turns, but modesty as well as honesty is usually the\r\nbest policy. Perhaps the best thing for such a witness to do under\r\nsuch circumstances is to do as once did the great mental alienist Dr.\r\nJohn P. Gray, when, having given an opinion on a question of insanity,\r\nhe was cross-examined as to the different theories from time to time\r\nprevalent as to what insanity was, and having stated what theories\r\nwere then the accepted ones, he was confronted by counsel on his\r\ncross-examination with the question: “What do you think of Dr. John P.\r\nGray as an authority on that question?” and then with his own writings,\r\nquite extensive, of many years before, in which he had advocated\r\ntheories apparently different from those which he had professed\r\nupon the witness-stand. Placed in this position, the distinguished\r\ngentleman simply replied: “It is true I cherished those theories at\r\nthat time, but I lived to learn better,” thus substantially disarming\r\nany criticism that could be made of him in his capacity as a witness in\r\nthat case.\r\n\r\n[184] For general rules for the conduct of expert witnesses see _infra_.\r\n\r\n[185] The principal classes of such subjects may, however, be briefly\r\nstated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Causes of death; especially in cases of homicide, suicide, accident,\r\netc., including poisoning.\r\n\r\n2. Causes, nature, and extent of personal injuries, by violence,\r\naccidents, explosions, railway disasters, collision between vessels,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n3. Birth of infants; was infant born dead or alive; if dead, was death\r\nthe result of natural causes or of internal violence; age of infant\r\nat the time of birth or death. Also causes of alleged sterility or\r\npregnancy; time pregnancy has existed; also cases of alleged impotency.\r\n\r\n4. Rape, abortion, bastardy, pederasty, onanism, masochism, and many\r\nother matters relating to the sexual organs.\r\n\r\n5. Malpractice cases, involving the degree of care and skill usual,\r\nand that used in the case under investigation, and involving delicate\r\nquestions as to the propriety of the treatment adopted, etc.\r\n\r\n[186] See also 1 Bishop Crim. Law, sec. 36; Rex _v._ Romiski, 1 Moody,\r\n19; Reg. _v._ Ellis, 2 Car. & K., 470.\r\n\r\n[187] In such cases as these the patient would have a right of action\r\nin the civil courts for damages against the physician or surgeon,\r\nbecause he had taken wilful and wicked advantage of his professional\r\nrelation to her, to do her a grievous wrong.\r\n\r\n[188] The Pennsylvania courts at an early period refused to follow this\r\ncommon-law doctrine, and held that the moment the womb is instinct with\r\nlife in embryo and the process of gestation has begun the crime may be\r\nperpetrated.

St.\r\nTr., 1,139; Duchess of Kingston’s case (1776), 20 How. St. Tr., 355\r\n(cf. p. 572, p. 585, p. 586, p. 613); Wilson _v._ Rastall (1791)., 4\r\nTerm R.

The cases of the Duchess of Kingston (_supra_); Lord William\r\nRussel (9 How. St. Tr., 602); Dr. Ratcliff (9 How. St. Tr., 582);\r\nEarl Ferrers (19 How. St. Tr., 886), and Rex _v._ Gibbons (_supra_),\r\nwere all criminal prosecutions; and in Annesley _v._ Anglesea, Wilson\r\n_v._ Rastall, Broad _v._ Pitt, and Greenough _v._ Gaskell (_supra_),\r\nwhich were civil causes, the question of the privilege of a medical\r\nman was not really in dispute. It is well settled that communications\r\nbetween attorney and client are privileged, and yet Judge Pitt Taylor\r\nexpresses some doubt whether the protection cannot be removed without\r\nthe client’s consent in cases where the interests of _criminal justice_\r\nrequire the production of the evidence (Taylor Ev., s. 929). This\r\nintimation of a distinction between criminal and civil actions, even\r\nin the case of attorneys, suggests the possibility of a difference\r\nbetween those two classes of actions in the case of medical men. The\r\ncases cited establish authoritatively that in criminal prosecutions,\r\nat common law, confidential communications between medical man and\r\npatient are not privileged; but in civil causes, the opinions of the\r\neminent judges seem to be _obiter dicta_. It is, however, established\r\nby other decisions that mere confidential relations do not prevent the\r\ndisclosure of communications. (For the case of _bankers_, see Loyd _v._\r\nFreshfield, 2 C. & P., 325; _managers_, Anderson _v._ British Bank of\r\nColumbia. 45 L. J. Ch., 449; _clerks_, Lee _v._ Burrell, 3 Camp., 337;\r\nWebb _v._ Smith, 1 C. & P., 337; _stewards_, Vaillant _v._ Dodemead, 2\r\nAtk., 524; Earl of Falmouth _v._ Moss, 11 Price, 455; _Pursuivant of\r\nHerald’s College_, Slade _v._ Tucker, 49 L. J. Ch., 644.)\r\n\r\nThe opinions of so many eminent men, though strictly speaking _obiter\r\ndicta_, together with the uniform statements of text-writers based upon\r\nthem, leave no room for reasonable doubt that independent of statute,\r\nin civil as well as criminal causes, communications between medical\r\nadviser and patient are not entitled to protection from disclosure in\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n[210] See Duchess of Kingston’s case (_supra_, p. 91, note 3) (cf.\r\n_ib._, pp. 572, 585, 586, 613).\r\n\r\n[211] Greenleaf Ev., secs. 249, 252, 252a.\r\n\r\n[212] Greenleaf Ev. s. 249.\r\n\r\n[213] See Barnes _v._ Harris, 7 Cush., 576; Hatton _v._ Robinson, 4\r\nPick, 422.

Stats. at Large, edited by John W. Edmonds, 2d ed., p. 726)\r\nstated as their reason for suggesting a statutory privilege for\r\ncommunications between physician and patient, that “in 4 Term Rep.,\r\n580, Buller, J. (to whom no one will attribute a disposition to relax\r\nthe rules of evidence), said it was ‘much to be lamented’ that the\r\ninformation specified in this section (2 R. S., p. 406, s. 73) was not\r\nprivileged. Mr. Phillips expressed the same sentiments in his treatise\r\non Evidence, p. 104. The ground on which communications to _counsel_\r\nare privileged is the supposed necessity of a full knowledge of the\r\nfacts, to advise correctly, and to prepare for the proper defence or\r\nprosecution of a suit. But surely the necessity of consulting a medical\r\nadviser, when life itself may be in jeopardy, is still stronger. And\r\nunless such consultations are privileged, men will be incidentally\r\npunished by being obliged to suffer the consequences of injuries\r\nwithout relief from the medical art, and without conviction of any\r\noffence. Besides, in such cases, during the struggle between legal duty\r\non the one hand and professional honor on the other, the latter, aided\r\nby a strong sense of the injustice and inhumanity of the rule, will\r\nin most cases furnish a temptation to the perversion or concealment\r\nof truth, too strong for human resistance. In every view that may be\r\ntaken of the policy, justice or humanity of the rule as it exists, its\r\nrelaxation seems highly expedient.”\r\n\r\nThese or similar reasons have prevailed in many States and Territories\r\nto bring about a statutory restriction on disclosures.\r\n\r\n[217] The following cases show or tend to show that the English rule\r\nis in operation in Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New\r\nJersey, Texas, and West Virginia: Wilson _v._ Town of Granby, 47 Conn.,\r\n59; Fayette _v._ Chesterville, 77 Me., 28; Weems _v._ Weems, 19 Md.,\r\n334; Morrissey _v._ Ingham, 111 Mass., 63; Barber _v._ Merriam, 11\r\nAllen, 322; Castner _v._ Sliker, 4 Vr., 95; Steagald _v._ State, 3 S.\r\nW.

In this case a\r\nconcussion or collision took place in a street between the sleighs of\r\ntwo parties, whereby a woman sustained an injury by the shaft, or some\r\nother part of one of the parties’ sleigh, striking her immediately\r\nabove the eye, and penetrating the brain. Surgical aid was immediately\r\ncalled in, and the woman received all the care and attention that the\r\nexigencies of the case required till five days afterward, when she died\r\nin consequence of the wound received. On the sixth day the coroner held\r\nan inquest, and in this, an action to recover for his services against\r\nthe county, it was _held_ he could recover.\r\n\r\n[514] County of Lancaster _v._ Mishler, 100 Pa. St., 624. In this, a\r\nsuit by the coroner against the county to recover his fees, it was\r\n_held_ that this presumption was not conclusive, and evidence was\r\nadmissible to show that he acted in bad faith and knowingly without\r\nsufficient cause or reason. The Court said: “The duty of a coroner\r\nto hold an inquest rests on sound reason, on that reason which is\r\nthe life of the law. It is not a power to be exercised capriciously\r\nand arbitrarily against all reason. The object of an inquest is to\r\nseek information, and obtain and secure evidence, in case of death by\r\nviolence or other undue means. If there be reasonable ground to suspect\r\nit was so caused, it becomes the duty of the coroner to act. If he has\r\nno grounds for suspecting that the death was not a natural one, it is a\r\nperversion of the whole spirit of the law to compel the county to pay\r\nfor such services.”\r\n\r\n[515] County of Fayette _v._ Batton, 108 Pa. St., 591. It appeared\r\nin this case, that nineteen persons came to their death suddenly and\r\nalmost simultaneously by an explosion of fire-damp in a coal-mine. The\r\ncoroner held a separate inquest over each body at the respective homes\r\nof the deceased, qualifying the same jury separately over each body,\r\nand the inquest returned a separate finding in each case. It was _held_\r\nthat this was the necessary and proper course to pursue under the\r\ncircumstances, and that the coroner was entitled to the legal fees in\r\neach case. In Boislinieu _v._ Board of Co. Commissioners, 32 Mo., 375,\r\nit was _held_ that the coroner is the sole judge as to the propriety\r\nor necessity of holding the inquest, and his action in that respect is\r\nnot subject to revision by the county commissioners, and he is entitled\r\nto fees under the statute notwithstanding the verdict of the coroner’s\r\njury discloses that the deceased died of a natural death, and not by\r\ncasualty or violence.\r\n\r\n[516] Am. & Eng.

In People _v._ Budge, 4 Park Crim. Rep.

In Pennsylvania a physician or surgeon, employed\r\nby the coroner to make a post-mortem examination, may recover from\r\nthe county a reasonable compensation for his services; and the county\r\ncommissioners have no power to appoint a surgeon to perform such\r\nservices, so as to preclude the coroner from selecting a proper person,\r\nin the exercise of his discretion. County of Allegany _v._ Shaw, 34 Pa.\r\nSt., 301. It has been held that the authority of a coroner to employ\r\na chemist to discover whether poison caused the death of one on whose\r\nbody he holds an inquest does not restrict him to the employment of a\r\nresident of the county, and that the analysis of the chemist must not\r\nbe made in the county of the coroner, and that even though the latter\r\nwas, by corrupt appliances of others, induced to employ a chemist, it\r\nis no defence to a suit by the chemist to recover compensation for his\r\nservices. Board of Commissioners _v._ Jameson, 86 Ind., 154.\r\n\r\nIn New York he is empowered by statute to employ not more than two\r\ncompetent surgeons to make post-mortem examinations and dissections and\r\nto testify to the same.

In this case, upon\r\napplication of the defendant and upon affidavits showing sufficient\r\nreasons therefor, a coroner of Chemung County, N. Y., directed the\r\nexhumation of the body of a man, who died in California about one\r\nyear previous and was buried in Chemung County; for the purpose of a\r\npost-mortem examination to determine whether the deceased was murdered,\r\nand the body was accordingly exhumed, and an examination had without\r\nempanelling a jury. An indictment was found against the defendant\r\ncharging her with body-stealing under section 311 of the New York\r\nPenal Code, against body-stealing. It was _held_ that conceding the\r\nproceeding to have been irregular, a conviction under that provision\r\nof the Penal Code could not be sustained, and this, without regard to\r\nthe motives which actuated the defendant; that if she had committed any\r\noffence it was not that of body-stealing.\r\n\r\n[528] Crisfield _v._ Perine, 15 Hun, 200, affirmed 81 N. Y., 622. This\r\nwas an action of assault and battery and it appeared that the defendant\r\nwas a coroner, and that he held an inquest on the dead body of a man\r\nwho died after receiving personal injuries in an affray which he had\r\nwith his nephew. A post-mortem examination was about to be made by two\r\nsurgeons employed by the coroner for that purpose. The plaintiff, who\r\nwas also a physician and surgeon, was in the room when the examination\r\nwas about to be entered upon and said that he wished to remain and\r\nwitness it, but the coroner asked him to leave, and on his refusing\r\ncaused him to be put out of the room. For this act this suit was\r\nbrought. It was _held_ that the suit could not be maintained.\r\n\r\n[529] Mass. Pub.

In this case upon the trial\r\nof an indictment for murder, evidence was received on the part of the\r\nprosecution, under objection and exception, to the effect that upon the\r\ncoroner’s inquest a witness testified that shortly after the murder\r\na stranger called at her house and asked the way to Sandy Hill, and\r\nalso for a drink of water; that the prisoner with a number of others\r\nwas placed around a room, and the witness pointed out the prisoner as\r\nthe one who so called; also that a number of persons, including the\r\nprisoner passed behind her, each one repeating the question asked her\r\nby the stranger, and she identified the prisoner by his voice, and that\r\nthe prisoner on that occasion did not Footnote: deny that he was such\r\nstranger. It was held that the prisoner was not bound to speak and his\r\nsilence could not be regarded as an evidence of guilt, and that the\r\nevidence was improperly received. The Court said: “The question whether\r\nthe defendant was bound to speak, and understood that he was at liberty\r\nto speak, if he chose, was submitted to the jury by the Court in his\r\ncharge, and an exception taken thereto. The doctrine as to silence\r\nbeing taken as an implied admission of the truth of allegations spoken\r\nor uttered in the presence of a person, does not apply to silence at\r\na judicial proceeding or hearing. And if the proceedings before the\r\ncoroner were of a judicial character the evidence was erroneously\r\nreceived. It is very apparent that the examination before the coroner\r\npartook of a judicial character, and what then transpired must be\r\nconsidered as a part of the proceedings; the coroner was there, a jury\r\nhad been empanelled, and witnesses were examined whose testimony was\r\nreturned as a portion of the coroner’s proceedings. It is difficult to\r\nsee upon what ground it can be claimed that the experiments which were\r\nmade were not in connection with the proceedings before the coroner and\r\na part thereof.”\r\n\r\n[561] Hendrickson _v._ People, 10 N.

In this case the\r\nprosecution was permitted to prove upon the trial that a justice\r\nof the peace had held an inquest on the body of a dead person, and\r\nappointed another person foreman of the inquest, and directed him to\r\nswear witnesses; and while the inquest was still sitting, the foreman\r\ncalled upon and requested the defendant to be sworn and give evidence\r\nas a witness, and he was duly sworn and was examined by the foreman, in\r\npresence of the inquest. It was held on appeal that his evidence was\r\nadmissible. On this point the Court said: “If the defendant had been\r\nawakened out of sleep, charged with crime, and then, in the necessary\r\nconfusion of his faculties sworn to testify, I should have steadfastly\r\nresisted the subsequent introduction of the testimony against him.\r\nThe common law, which justifies an accused man in entire silence,\r\nappears in beautiful contrast to the continental systems, which permit\r\nthe criminal to be racked by inquisitorial skill, until something\r\nbe wrung from him which may be patched up into proof of guilt. This\r\ncase shows nothing of the kind. The phrase ‘called up’ commented on\r\nby the counsel, does not appear in the record, and if employed by the\r\nwitnesses related doubtless to the ordinary case of calling forth\r\na witness, and not awakening him from slumber. When the defendant\r\nwas sworn before the inquest, he had neither been charged with nor\r\nsuspected of crime. He might have declined to testify, and this\r\nwould have pointed suspicion directly to him. He took the risk of a\r\nstatement, and cannot complain that he met the legitimate consequences\r\nof the act. In the eye of all the authorities, it was a voluntary\r\nstatement.”\r\n\r\n[567] Clough _v._ The State, 7 Neb., 320.\r\n\r\n[568] The facts upon which the following statements are based have been\r\nlargely drawn from Taylor.
