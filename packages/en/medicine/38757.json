COCHRAN, PRINTERS,\r\n  LANCASTER, PA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the many years that the compiler has had the management of the\r\npublishing department of Messrs. Boericke & Tafel--long to look back\r\nover, yet short to live--so many inquiries came in for \"literature,\" or,\r\nin the form, \"where can I find something about\" this, that, or the\r\nother, remedy, that finally I became convinced that there might be a\r\nniche in the great world's already over-crowded library for a book\r\ncontaining, in part, at least, the information desired by my numerous\r\ncorrespondents. This determined, and the great publishing house willing\r\nto back the enterprise, came the task of collecting the material. The\r\nwork once begun, it was soon found that it is much easier to plan such a\r\nvolume than to carry out the plan, for it involved no inconsiderable\r\namount of delving in dusty piles of old journals to discover the sought\r\nfor matter, which, when brought to light, had to be scanned closely to\r\ndetermine whether it was of a nature to justify this literary\r\nresurrection. However, in the odd hours of time that could be bestowed\r\nthe work was finally completed and--the result is before you, kindly\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nThat this collection of papers has many gems is, I believe, not to be\r\nquestioned; that some better papers on the remedies than those herein\r\npresented may exist is also probable; that it may contain some that are\r\nof doubtful value is not to be denied, and even some that have no right\r\nin such a book may have crept in. But what it is, it is; take the good\r\nand, in the current phrase of the hour, \"forget\" the rest.\r\n\r\nThe part born by the editor, beyond delving for and selecting the\r\nremedies, will be found scattered through the book in bracketed small\r\ntype, and consists simply in announcing who the writer of the paper was\r\nand where it may be found; no attempt has been made at editing any of\r\nthe papers, or commenting on them, beyond a little cutting out of a\r\nlittle verbosity here and there, or of matter not bearing on the use of\r\nthe remedy.\r\n\r\nThe material was drawn from journals of all \"schools,\" wherever a paper\r\ncould be found that seemed to contain something not to be found in\r\nmedical-book literature, and to be honestly written.\r\n\r\nThe new remedies of the laboratory have been purposely ignored because\r\nthey do not come in the scheme of this book, they having a literature of\r\ntheir own that, not infrequently, may be had \"free on request\" to the\r\nlaboratories. Only remedies (with a few exceptions) such as nature gives\r\nus are included in this work.\r\n\r\nAnd now the task completed naught remains but for the compiler to\r\nsubscribe himself,\r\n\r\n

ORD., Euphorbiaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Indian Acalypha, Indian Nettle.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh plant is macerated with two parts by weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Tonnere, of Calcutta, India, seems to have been the\r\n     first to call attention to this plant as a remedy. In a\r\n     small work, _Additions to the Homoeopathic Materia\r\n     Medica_, collected and arranged by Henry Thomas, M. D.,\r\n     and published in London in the year 1858, appears the\r\n     following credited to that physician.)\r\n\r\nTincture of the _Acalypha Indica_, prepared and administered in the\r\nsixth decimal dilution, is specific in haemorrhage from the lungs. In\r\nthree cases in which I have employed it, the persons were affected with\r\nphthisis. In one case there was a tuberculous affection of the upper\r\nportion of the left lung, of some two years' standing. Haemoptysis had\r\nbeen going on for three months; the expectoration had been in the\r\nmorning pure blood; in the evening dark lumps of clotted blood, and the\r\nfits of coughing were very violent at night. In this case all\r\nhomoeopathic remedies had been tried unsuccessfully, when I\r\naccidentally discovered the virtues of the _Acalypha Indica_, that\r\nremedy having been given me by a native for jaundice. I prepared the\r\nmother tincture upon the homoeopathic principle, and took 10 drops,\r\nwhich brought on a severe fit of dry cough, followed by spitting of\r\nblood. Having noted all the symptoms experienced by myself, and finding\r\nthat they were nearly all similar to those of my patients, I gave six\r\ndrops 6th [decimal] dilution in half a tumbler of water, a spoonful to\r\nbe taken every half hour, beginning immediately (9 A.M.). At 6 P.M., the\r\nblood stopped. I continued this for eight days, and the blood has never\r\nreappeared (now three months since). The patient is improving, and\r\nauscultation proves the disease has decreased, and I am in hopes to\r\naffect a cure, yet one month since I have been giving them the medicine\r\nthey have not spit any blood, although previously one of them never\r\npassed a day without spitting a great quantity. _Calcarea carb._ is an\r\nantidote to the _Acalypha_.\r\n\r\nAnother transatlantic medical friend writes:--\"I hope you obtained some\r\nof the _Acalypha Indica_ while you were here. I have found it perfectly\r\nsuccessful in arresting haemoptysis in three cases of consumption in the\r\nlast stage; I could not perceive any other effect from its use, but the\r\ncessation of the hemorrhagic sputa was, I think, a great advantage.\"\r\n\r\nIts use in my hands has been very satisfactory, but I have only tried it\r\nin similar cases to those already cited. The first instance of my using\r\nit--in a hopeless case of phthisis--a continued and wearisome haemoptysis\r\nsuccumbed to its exhibition, and quiet sleep succeeded its use--the\r\npatient eventually died of pulmonary paralysis.\r\n\r\nIn a case of passive haemorrhage from the lungs, after _Arnica_ was used\r\nwith little benefit, _Acalypha_ benefited, and then failed; after which\r\nthe use of _Arnica_ entirely stayed the haemorrhagic flow. (Perhaps\r\n_Hamamelis_ would have at once cured, but it was not at hand.)[A]\r\n\r\n    [A] Homoeopathic Review, vol. 1, p. 256.\r\n\r\nK., a phthisical patient, had haemoptysis to a considerable extent; in a\r\nshort time his voice failed him; he took half-drop doses of 7th\r\n[decimal] dilution of _Acalypha_ in water every half hour, and in a few\r\nhours the blood spitting left him entirely.\r\n\r\n     (In 1885 Dr. Peter Cooper, of Wilmington, Delaware, read\r\n     a paper on the drug _Acalypha Indica_ of which the\r\n     following is an abstract:)\r\n\r\nProfessor Jones recapitulates as follows: \"_Time._ Haemorrhage occurs in\r\nmorning. _Blood._ Bright-red and not profuse in morning; dark and\r\nclotted in afternoon. _Pulse._ Neither quickened nor hard; rather soft\r\nand easily compressible. _Cough._ Violent and in fits at night; patient\r\nhas a played-out feeling in the morning and gains in strength as the day\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\n\"_N. B._--Worthy of trial in all pathological haemorrhages having notedly\r\na morning exacerbation.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline presentation of the drug given us by so eminent an\r\nauthority as Professor Jones, of the University of Michigan. It was his\r\n\"N. B.,\" his suggestion that _Acalypha_ was worthy of trial in all\r\npathological haemorrhages from any source, providing the morning\r\naggravation was present, that fixed my attention upon the drug\r\nespecially. At the time I had a case of haemorrhage per rectum that had\r\nbaffled me for several months. No remedy had aided the case in the\r\nleast, so far as I could see, unless it was Pond's Extract used locally\r\nin the form of injection; and I finally came to the conclusion that the\r\nrelief apparently due to the _Hamamelis_ was merely a coincidence. I had\r\ngiven all the haemorrhagic remedies I knew of or could hear of. Still the\r\nbleeding came just as often, with increasing severity. Each time the\r\npatient was sure she would \"bleed to death,\" and I was not positive she\r\nwould be disappointed. In fact, I was so hopeless that I used to delay\r\nthe answer to her summons as long as possible, so that the bleeding\r\nmight have time to exhaust itself. She became reduced in flesh and the\r\nhaemorrhagic drugs became reduced in number, until like the nine little\r\nIndians sitting on a gate the last one tumbled off and then there was\r\nnone. As soon as I read Dr. Jones' monograph on _Acalypha Indica_, I\r\ndetermined to try it. She had all the symptoms--bright-red blood in the\r\nmorning; dark and clotted in the afternoon and evening; weak and languid\r\nin the forenoon, stronger during the afternoon--except one, _i.e._,\r\ninstead of the blood coming from the lungs it came from within the\r\nportals of the anus. I procured the 6x dil. and served it in water. It\r\ngave speedy, almost immediate relief. Each subsequent attack came less\r\nprofuse and at longer intervals. She has not had a haemorrhage now for\r\ntwo months, while before she was having from seven to one (continuous) a\r\nweek. She is gaining in flesh, is in every way improved, and keeps\r\n_Acalypha Indica_ constantly by her.\r\n\r\n\r\nACIDUM LACTICUM.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Lactic acid.\r\n\r\nORIGIN.--Lactic acid is obtained from sour milk, resulting from the\r\nfermentation of the sugar of milk under the influence of casein.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION _for Homoeopathic Use_.--One part by weight of pure lactic\r\nacid is dissolved in 99 parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (A very complete proving of this remedy will be found in\r\n     Allen's _Encyclopaedia of Pure Materia Medica_, but little\r\n     use seems to have been made of it, though the following\r\n     by Dr. Tybel-Aschersleben, _Allgemeine Hom. Zeitung_,\r\n     March 13, 1890, seems to show that it is very efficient\r\n     in certain forms of rheumatism.)\r\n\r\nWe are by no means rich in remedies against arthritic rheumatism, and\r\nthose which we do use lack the reputation of being reliable. A new and a\r\nvaluable remedy will therefore be a welcome addition to this list. I say\r\nreliable, inasmuch as this remedy is truly homoeopathically indicated\r\nfor, according to Foster, of Leitz, Niemeyer's Pathology, 10th edition,\r\n2d vol., pp. 561: \"_Lactic acid in large doses and used for a long time\r\nwill produce symptoms entirely analogous to arthritic rheumatism_.\" We\r\nalso find mention elsewhere that the use of lactic acid occasioned\r\nrheumatic pains in the thigh.\r\n\r\nCLINICAL CASES.\r\n\r\n1. A young girl aet. 15 was afflicted with acute arthritic rheumatism,\r\nshe received _Acid Lacticum_ 2x dil., a dose every 2 or 3 hours, and was\r\nso much improved in two weeks that the pain had subsided, and for her\r\nremaining weakness _China off._ sufficed.\r\n\r\n2. A nine-year-old girl was confined to her bed for three weeks with\r\nacute arthritic rheumatism. _Acid Lacticum 2_ speedily cured her.\r\n\r\n3. A miner, B., had been afflicted over six weeks with acute arthritic\r\nrheumatism. The first dose of _Acid Lactic 2_ gave relief and a second\r\ndose cured the man.\r\n\r\n4. In a case with swollen and very painful joints one dose of _Acidum\r\nLactic 2_ sufficed to overcome the pain and the swelling. Against the\r\nremaining weakness _China_ proved efficacious.\r\n\r\n5. Arthritic rheumatism of the wrist vanished slowly after using _Acid\r\nLactic 2_ from two to three weeks.\r\n\r\n6. A patient afflicted with arthritic rheumatism for four weeks,\r\naccompanied by copious perspiration, soon mended under the use of _Acid\r\nLactic 2_ and was entirely cured within two weeks.\r\n\r\n7. Even in a case of chronic arthritis with inflation of the Epiphyses\r\nof Metacarpal bones and consequent partial displacement of the fingers,\r\n_Lactic Acid 2_ produced such a decided amelioration that two months\r\nlater the report said: all pains are gone even the anchylosis has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n     (It has also been successfully employed in cases where\r\n     the digestive powers are weak and is said to be\r\n     preferable to other acids in such cases. It has also been\r\n     successfully employed in cases of dyspepsia.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAETHIOPS ANTIMONIALIS.\r\n\r\n     (This remedy is prepared by triturating together equal\r\n     parts of _AEthiops mineralis_ and _Antimonium crudum_; we\r\n     may add that the first named consists of a trituration of\r\n     equal parts of _Mercurius viv._ and washed flowers of\r\n     sulphur. Therefore _AEthiops antimon._ consists of\r\n     mercury, crude antimony and sulphur.\r\n\r\n     The following clinical cases illustrating the use of the\r\n     preparation is by Dr. H. Goullon and was published in\r\n     Vol. II of the _Zeitschrift fuer Homoeopathie_:)\r\n\r\nThe following case was cured in a few days by _AEthiops antimonalis_\r\nafter having been treated by a homoeopath who strictly followed\r\nHahnemann's rules, but failed to make an impression beyond a certain\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nMiss A. inherited from her father, who was reported to have suffered\r\nfrom laryngitis, a distinct disposition to scrofulosis and tuberculosis.\r\nThis was proved two years ago by a bloody cough caused by lung catarrh.\r\nAfter the lung was affected she suffered from profuse sweats, especially\r\ndown the back, but of special interest was the appearance of a \"quince\r\ncolored\" swelling of the size of a pea at the extreme corner of the left\r\neye with suppuration which threatened the bulbus. A skilled specialist\r\nremoved by operation this pus-hearth, which no doubt acted as a\r\nfontanel. The immediate result was a large furuncle under the arm and\r\nthe affliction for which I was consulted. A patient presented herself to\r\nme whose appearance was shocking. Numerous parts of her face were\r\nliterally covered with thick, elevated fissured scabs. A scrofulent\r\nliquid was oozing out, and the worst were those parts on the side of the\r\nlower lip, the nostrils and the root of the nose. On the whole, a\r\ncertain symmetry could be observed in the arrangements of these\r\nfrightful diseased products.\r\n\r\nThis eruption, which according to its nature must be called\r\nherpetic-eczematous, had existed for five months. The patient, who has\r\nred hair, and is between 20 and 30 years old, contracted this disease at\r\nthe sight of a fainting sister. This kind of genesis is an established\r\nfact. I remember of reading in Stark's \"General Pathology\" of an\r\ninstance where a mother was affected with eczema of the lips immediately\r\non seeing her child fall on a knife.\r\n\r\nOur patient, however, lost the above mentioned sweats, which proves that\r\nthe fright had a metastatic effect. I learned that at first there\r\nappeared very small spots which developed into pustules, infecting half\r\nof the forehead. Scratching aggravated the condition, so that some\r\nplaces assumed a cup-like appearance, somewhat as favus.\r\n\r\nWhen patient came to me the face was oozing so terribly that the pillow\r\nwas thoroughly soaked in the morning, and she suffered greatly. When\r\nasked the nature of the pains she said that they were sometimes itching,\r\nsometimes tensive, and often indescribable, suddenly appearing and\r\ndisappearing.\r\n\r\nWhat should be done? Certainly no strictly homoeopathic indication\r\npresented itself since one might think of _Sulphur_, another of\r\n_Arsenicum_, _Silicea_, _Hepar sulphur_, _Causticum_, _Mezereum_, etc.\r\nIn such case I have laid down, as a rule for my guidance, never to\r\nexperiment at the cost of the patient (and my own as well as\r\nHahnemann's), but to employ a so-called empirical remedy. I know\r\n_AEthiops antimonialis_ as a very effective remedy through its\r\nrecommendation (by the Berlin Society of Homoeopathic Physicians) in\r\nophthalmia scrofulosa of the worst kind, a fact which I proved myself to\r\nbe correct. In this case, also, we find the deepest and most stubborn\r\ndisturbance of the organic juices and a subject with every indication of\r\nthe worst form of scrofula, ending in lethal cancer--dyscrasia or\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\nThe patient received the remedy in doses of the 1st centesimal\r\ntrituration, every evening and morning, as much as a point of a knife\r\nblade would hold. There was no attempt at external removal of the\r\neruption, a method so much favored by the allopaths, and yet the simple\r\ninternal effort was magical, since after a few days the scabs were dried\r\nup, had fallen off, and the terrible oozing as well as the pain had\r\nceased. The happy patient presented herself again on Friday, after\r\nhaving taken the medicine for the first time on Sunday evening. Very\r\ngreat changes could, indeed, be noticed which justified the hope for a\r\nspeedy and total cure.\r\n\r\nI again ask all my colleagues which was the principle of healing in this\r\ncase? We may soonest think of Schuessler's therapeutic maxim, the\r\nbiochemic principle. The definition that this preparation acts as a\r\nblood purifier is not sufficient, and yet it may be accepted as the most\r\nintelligent.\r\n\r\nSchoeman triturates the _AEthiops antimonalis_ with _AEthiops mercurialis_\r\n(or _mineralis_), which last consists of equal parts of quicksilver and\r\nsulphur, and says of the product: \"It acts analogous to _AEthiops\r\nmercurialis_, but stronger, and is therefore preferred to it in\r\nscrofulous eruptions of the skin, scald, milk-scab, scrofulosis\r\nconjunctivitis, keratitis, blepharitis glandulosa, otorrhoea and\r\nswellings of the glands. It is especially valuable for children as a\r\nmild but nevertheless effective remedy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAGAVE AMERICANA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Amaryllidaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, American Aloe, Maguey, Century Plant.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh leaves are pounded to a pulp and macerated with\r\ntwo parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (We find the following concerning this little known\r\n     remedy in Volume I, 1851, of the _North American Journal\r\n     of Homoeopathy_.)\r\n\r\n1. _Agave Americana or Maguey._--[Dr. Perin, U. S. A., stationed at Fort\r\nMcIntosh, in Texas, having many cases of scurvy to treat, and finding\r\nthe usual allopathic routine ineffectual, was led to make inquiry as to\r\nthe domestic remedies in use among the natives. Among others, his\r\nattention was called to the _Agave Americana_ or _American Aloe_, and he\r\nreports to the Surgeon General the following cases in which it was the\r\ndrug relied on. We extract from the _N. Y. Jour. Med._:]\r\n\r\nPrivate Turby, of Company \"G,\" 1st U. S. Infantry, was admitted into\r\nhospital March 25th, in the following state: Countenance pale and\r\ndejected; gums swollen and bleeding; left leg, from ankle joint to\r\ngroin, covered with dark purple blotches; leg swollen, painful, and of\r\nstony hardness; pulse small, feeble; appetite poor; bowels constipated.\r\n\r\nHe was placed upon lime juice, diluted and sweetened, so as to make an\r\nagreeable drink, in as large quantities as his stomach would bear; diet\r\ngenerous as could be procured, consisting of fresh meat, milk, eggs,\r\netc.; vegetables could not be procured.\r\n\r\nApril 11th. His condition was but slightly improved; he was then placed\r\nupon the expressed juice of the maguey, in doses of f. [Latin: ezh]ij.\r\nthree times daily; same diet continued.\r\n\r\nApril 17th. Countenance no longer dejected, but bright and cheerful;\r\npurple spots almost entirely disappeared; arose from his bed and walked\r\nacross the hospital unassisted; medicine continued.\r\n\r\nMay 4th. So much improved so as to be able to return to his company\r\nquarters, where he is accordingly sent; medicine continued.\r\n\r\nMay 7th. Almost entirely well; continued medicine.\r\n\r\nPrivate Hood, \"G\" Company, 1st U. S. Infantry, was admitted into\r\nhospital April 10th. His general condition did not differ much from\r\nPrivate Turby's. He had been on the sick report for eight days; had been\r\ntaking citric acid drinks, but grew gradually worse up to the time of\r\nhis admission, when he was placed upon lime-juice until the 13th, at\r\nwhich time no perceptible change had taken place. On that date he\r\ncommenced the use of the expressed juice of the maguey; same diet as the\r\ncase above described.\r\n\r\nApril 21st. General state so much improved that he was sent to his\r\ncompany quarters.\r\n\r\nMay 22d. Well; returned to duty.\r\n\r\nEleven cases, all milder in form than the two just related, were\r\ncontinued upon the lime-juice; diet the same. On the 21st of April they\r\nexhibited evidences of improvement, but it was nothing when compared\r\nwith the cases under the use of the maguey.\r\n\r\nSeven cases were under treatment during the same time, making use of\r\ncitric acid. On the 21st of April no one had improved, and three were\r\ngrowing worse.\r\n\r\nAt this time so convinced was I of the great superiority of the maguey\r\nover either of the other remedies employed that I determined to place\r\nall the patients upon that medicine. The result has proved exceedingly\r\ngratifying; every case has improved rapidly from that date. The\r\ncountenance, so universally dejected and despairing in the patients\r\naffected with scurvy, is brightened up by contentment and hope in two\r\ndays from the time of its introduction; the most marked evidences of\r\nimprovement were observable at every successive visit. From observing\r\nthe effects of the maguey in the cases which have occurred in this\r\ncommand, I am compelled to place it far above that remedy which, till\r\nnow, has stood above every other--the lime-juice.\r\n\r\nThis no doubt will appear strong language, but further experience will\r\nverify it.\r\n\r\nThe juice of the maguey contains a large amount of vegetable and\r\nsaccharine matter, and of itself is sufficiently nutritious to sustain a\r\npatient for days.\r\n\r\nThis succulent plant grows indigenous in most parts of the State, and,\r\nif I am correctly informed, in New Mexico and California. In Mexico it\r\nis well-known as the plant from which they manufacture their favorite\r\ndrink, the \"Pulque,\" and grows in great abundance. As it delights in a\r\ndry sandy soil, it can be cultivated where nothing but the cactus will\r\ngrow; for this reason, it will be found invaluable to the army at many\r\nof the western posts, where vegetables cannot be procured.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which it is used is as follows, viz.:--The leaves are cut\r\noff close to the root, they are placed in hot ashes until thoroughly\r\ncooked, when they are removed, and the juice expressed from them. The\r\nexpressed juice is then strained, and may be used thus, or may be\r\nsweetened. It may be given in doses of f. [Latin: ezh]ij. to f. [Latin:\r\nezh]iij. three times daily.\r\n\r\nIt is not disagreeable to take, and in every instance it has proved to\r\nagree well with the stomach and bowels.\r\n\r\nAfter the leaves have been cooked, the cortical portion near the root\r\nmay be removed, and the white internal portion may be eaten; it appears\r\nto be a wholesome and nutritious food. I have seen muleteers use it in\r\nthis way, and they seem to be very fond of it. I have been informed,\r\nupon good authority, that several tribes of Indians in New Mexico make\r\nuse of it in the same manner. The use of the leaf in this way, I\r\nbelieve, will ward off most effectually incipient scorbutus.\r\n\r\n     (In El Siglo Medico, 1890, Dr. Fernandez Avila reports\r\n     the case of a boy, aet. 8, who had been bitten by a\r\n     supposedly mad dog on Feb. 18. The wound healed up, but\r\n     on July 7th the boy developed all the symptoms of rabies\r\n     and on the 17th was so violent that he had to be tied and\r\n     had not tasted food for seventy-two hours as all remedies\r\n     failed to produce any effect, the doctor, having read\r\n     that _Agave Americana_ was efficacious in such cases, and\r\n     having none of the tincture at hand, gave the boy a piece\r\n     of the plant itself which he greedily ate; it was given\r\n     to him as long as he would take it. On the 25th his\r\n     symptoms had all abated and he was dismissed cured.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBROSIA ARTEMISIFOLIA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Compositae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Rag Weed, Hog Weed.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh leaves and flowers are pounded to a pulp and\r\nmacerated with two parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following concerning this little used remedy was\r\n     contributed to the HOMOEOPATHIC RECORDER, 1889, by Dr.\r\n     C. F. Millspaugh, at that time the editor):\r\n\r\nOf late years much attention has been called to the species of the genus\r\nAmbrosia (the Rag Weeds) as being, through the agency of their pollen,\r\nthe cause of hay fever. Many people afflicted with this troublesome\r\ncomplaint lay the charge directly at its doors, while others claim that,\r\nin all probability, it is the direct cause, as their sufferings always\r\ncommence during the anthesis of the plant. The general impression,\r\nhowever, both among the laity and the medical fraternity, has been that\r\nthe effect was a purely mechanical one, the nasal mucous membranes\r\nbeing directly irritated by the pollen dust in substance. If this were\r\ntrue, would not every one suffer from hay fever? Impressed with the\r\nabove report, I had the pleasure of curing two attacks while writing my\r\nwork upon \"American Medicinal Plants,\" in which the above species\r\nfigures. Since the publication of the work, all the cases I have had of\r\nthe disease (four) have yielded beautifully to the 3d centesimal potency\r\nof the drug.\r\n\r\nThe four cases, Mr. B----, Mrs. I----, Mr. C---- and Miss P----,\r\npresented the following generic symptoms: Inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembranes of the nose, adventing yearly in the autumn. At first dryness,\r\nthen watery discharges, finally involving the frontal sinuses and the\r\nconjunctival membrane. In Mr. B. and Miss P. the irritation extended to\r\nthe trachea and bronchial tubes, in Mr. B. amounting to severe asthmatic\r\nattacks. In all cases the coryza was very severe, and in previous years\r\nlasted, in spite of all treatment, from four to eight weeks. Mr. B. has\r\nfound relief from _Ambrosia_ [Latin: ezh], three times a day, in from\r\nfour to six days, for three successive years, with no return of the\r\ntrouble in the same year; Mrs. I. has been relieved in from two to four\r\ndays for two years; Mr. C. gets immediate relief in twenty-four hours\r\n(three seasons); Miss P., in this her first experience with _Ambrosia_,\r\nfound entire relief from six doses.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMYGDALUS PERSICA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Rosaceae. Amygdaleae.\r\n\r\nSYNONYM, Persica vulgaris.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Peach.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The tincture is made by pounding to a pulp the fresh bark\r\nof the twigs and macerating in two parts by weight of alcohol. The\r\ninfusion is made by taking of the bark one part and of boiling Distilled\r\nWater ten parts. Infuse in a covered vessel for one hour and strain.\r\n\r\n     (Outside the old herbalists the virtues of the bark and\r\n     leaves of the peach tree have received little attention.\r\n     The following contributed by Dr. C. C. Edson in the\r\n     _Chicago Medical Times_, 1890, however, aroused some\r\n     attention):\r\n\r\nSome ten years ago I had a little patient whose principle difficulty\r\nseemed to be an inability to retain anything whatever upon its stomach.\r\nIt would vomit up promptly everything I gave it, and I had given it\r\neverything I had ever heard of and also had eminent council, but it was\r\nno go; I was literally at my rope's end. At this juncture an elderly\r\nlady neighbor, one of \"the good old mothers,\" timidly suggested an\r\ninfusion of peach bark. Well, as it was any port in storm, I started to\r\nfind the coveted bark, which I was fortunate enough to procure after a\r\nlong tramp through the country and two feet of snow. I prepared an\r\ninfusion, gave the little patient a few swallows, and presto! the deed\r\nwas done, the child cured. * * It fills all the indications of the\r\nleaves and many more. It fills the indications of hydrocyanic acid,\r\ningluvin, ipecac or any other anti-emetic. It will more frequently allay\r\nthe vomiting of pregnancy than any remedy I have ever tried. And nearly\r\nevery case of retching or vomiting (except it be reflex) will promptly\r\nyield under its use. * * * For an adult the dose is five drops, and in\r\nurgent cases repeat every five to ten minutes until the symptoms\r\nsubside, after which give it at intervals of one to four hours as\r\nindicated. After ten years' use I am thoroughly convinced that any\r\nphysician once giving it a thorough trial will never again be without\r\nit. Of course it is not a specific for all \"upheavals of the inner man,\"\r\nbut will I think meet more indications than any other known remedy of\r\nits class.\r\n\r\n     (This brought out the following from Dr. Kirkpatrick in\r\n     the same journal):\r\n\r\nI must say that I feel a little plagued after reading what Dr. Edson\r\nsays about _Amygdalus_; he has taken the wind out of my sails, but I\r\nmust give my experience. Quite a number of years since a good friend in\r\nthe profession called on me, and asked me to visit one of his patients,\r\nhonestly stating that he thought she would die. I went a few miles in\r\nthe country to see her. She had been vomiting blood for two or three\r\ndays, and, notwithstanding she had had oxalate of cerium, bismuth,\r\npepsin, ingluvin and other good remedies, everything she swallowed would\r\ncome up, so that she looked more like a corpse than a living being. I\r\nordered them to go out and get me some of the young switches of the last\r\nyear's growth from the peach tree; I had them pound them to loosen the\r\nbark; I then nearly filled a tumbler with this bark, then covered it\r\nwith water. I ordered her a teaspoonful to be taken after each time she\r\nvomited, one dose being given then, and one every hour after the\r\nvomiting stopped. The result was, she vomited no more and made a good\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n* * * In recent cases I have very rarely had to give the second\r\nprescription to relieve morning sickness. I was visiting a doctor in\r\nQuincy; while there he told me he was afraid he would have either to\r\nmake a lady abort or let her die, from the fact that he had failed to\r\nstop her vomiting. I happened to have a sample of the medicine with me;\r\nI gave it to him, he took it to the lady and in a few days he reported\r\nher well. I may say, like Dr. Edson, it is a standard remedy with me. I\r\nhave found it very useful in haemorrhage from the bladder. Some of my\r\nlady patients find it very good in nervous headache. I have used the\r\ntincture prepared from the leaves, but it is far inferior to that\r\nprepared from the bark of the young shoots. A medical friend was going\r\nto see a lady who had morning sickness; he told me he had thought of\r\nadvising her to use popcorn; I handed him a small bottle of my\r\n_Amygdalus_ and told him to take a couple of ears of corn in his pocket\r\nand try both. The next time I met him he said my medicine had done the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Oliver S. Haines, of Philadelphia, also contributed\r\n     the following experience):\r\n\r\nApropos of the remarks made by Dr. C. C. Edson upon the efficacy of\r\ninfusion of peach _bark_ in the gastric irritability of children, we\r\nmight mention the following authentic case:\r\n\r\nAn infant, during its second summer, had been much reduced by acute\r\ndyspeptic diarrhoea. A marked feature of this case was the persistent\r\nvomiting of all food. The stomach would tolerate no form of baby food\r\nwith or without milk. The child's parents had consulted some eminent\r\nphysicians of our city. The child had been treated homoeopathically.\r\nNone of the remedies chosen seemed to produce the desired effect. After\r\na consultation it was deemed best to send the infant to the mountains.\r\nThe change aggravated its condition. While the parents hourly expected\r\ntheir baby would die, it was suggested that they send for an old\r\npractitioner living in the mountains near at hand. This man had a local\r\nreputation as a saver of dying babies. His prescription was as follows:\r\nTwo or three fresh peach _leaves_ were to be put in a cup of boiling\r\nwater, the infant to receive a \"drink\" of this infusion at frequent\r\nintervals. The effects of this remedy were as remarkable in this case as\r\nin the case narrated by Dr. Edson. Our child soon retained food and\r\neventually recovered.\r\n\r\nIt seems this ancient disciple of Esculapius had long used peach leaves\r\nand regarded them as possessing specific virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\nANAGALIS ARVENSIS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Primulaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Scarlet Pimpernel. Poor Man's Weather-Glass.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh plant, of the scarlet-flowered variety, gathered\r\nbefore the development of the flowers, is pounded to a pulp and\r\nsubjected to pressure. The expressed juice is mingled with an equal part\r\nby weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (This paper was arranged from the provings by Dr. W. H.\r\n     A. Fitz for the Organon and Materia Medica Society of\r\n     Philadelphia, and published in the _Medical Advance_,\r\n     1891)\r\n\r\nWe think of this remedy for the following clinical indications:\r\nHypochondriasis, mania, epilepsy. Amblyopia, cataract, spots on the\r\ncornea. Syphilis, hepatitis and indurated liver, visceral obstruction,\r\ninflammation of rectum (horses), hemorrhoids, inflammation of kidneys,\r\ngleet, copious urination (horses), gravel, syphilis with deranged mind,\r\nnosebleed, pain in small of back, gonorrhoea, amenorrhoea, cancer of\r\nmammea, sterility (cows), consumption, lumbago, itching, gout, bloody\r\nsweat (murrain of calves), dropsy, ill-conditioned ulcers, snake bites\r\nand hydrophobia, promotes the expulsion of splinters, inflammation of\r\nstomach (horses).\r\n\r\nIt is characterized by great tickling and itching. We find tickling and\r\npricking in the urethra, in left ear; on tip of nose; at soft palate as\r\nfrom something cold; in symphysis pubis; as from a brush against\r\nepiglottis (with hoarseness); pain in right leg and at os illium;\r\nitching on vertex and occiput; of eyelids; in left ear; on cheek bones;\r\nitching and tickling stitches on left corner of mouth and upper lip; in\r\nrectum; at anus after evacuation of bowels; on left side of chest,\r\nprincipally on nipple; on neck and scapula; on inside of upper arm, just\r\nabove elbow joint; on back of right hand; tetter on hands and fingers.\r\nIn fact, great itching all over the skin.\r\n\r\nHEADACHE just over supra-orbital ridges, with eructations and rumbling\r\nin bowels; spasmodic lancination in temples, extending to eyes; pressive\r\naching in forehead and occiput from a current of air blowing on him;\r\nintense headache and nausea, with pains throughout the body.

Then\r\nadd two drachms of pure Bromine. _Clemens._\r\n\r\n     (The following paper was translated, 1888, from the\r\n     German (_Deutsche Clinic_, March, 1859) of Dr. Th.\r\n     Clemens, by the late Dr. Samuel Lilienthal):\r\n\r\nArsenious acid, Arsenic blanc, Arsenic oxide, Flowers of Arsenic (AsO_3)\r\nis commonly used as the only preparation in which it could be\r\nassimilated. In the Solutio Fowleri we find a combination with Kali\r\ncarbonicum e Tartaro, a combination which allows to the Arsenious acid\r\nits full destructive power. Now comes Spiritus Angelicae comp. and the\r\npure chemical preparation smells like Theriac, but it ought hardly ever\r\nbe allowed to add something to a pure chemical preparation in order to\r\ngive it taste, color, and use. This Spir. Angel. comp. is made up of\r\nAnglica, Siordium, Juniper berries, Valerian, Camphor, and Alcohol, and\r\nSolutio Fowleri is prepared even to this day in the same manner, and\r\nought therefore be expelled from every pharmacopoeia, especially as it\r\nis sure to spoil in the pharmacies if kept too long on the shelves.\r\nLooking, therefore, for a better preparation, I prescribe now for the\r\nlast decade: [Symbol: Rx]. Arsen. albi. depurat. pulv., Kali carb. e\r\nTartar. [=a][=a] [Latin: ezh]j., coque cum Aqua destill. lb 1/2 ad\r\nperfect. solutionem, refriger., adde aqua destil. q. s. ut fiat solutio\r\n[Latin: ezh]xii., Dein adde Brom. pur. [Latin: ezh]ii. This solution,\r\nwhich during first eight days is frequently shaken, becomes colorless in\r\nthe fourth week, and is then ready for use. It must be kept in a dark,\r\ncool place.\r\n\r\nI will now give my reason for choosing Bromine as a combination. The\r\nstudy of mineral waters is an old pet of mine; many of them contain\r\nArsenic in combination with Bromine, and are all well known for their\r\nroborating and alterating qualities. I begun, therefore, my experiments\r\nwith minute doses of _Brom. arsen._; gradually these were increased, and\r\nI felt astonished what large doses were well borne, and how long I could\r\nuse this preparation without injurious consequences. After a few drops\r\nof my solution I could prove Arsenic in all secretions, an experiment\r\neasily made by Marsh's test. Experiments on animals with toxic doses of\r\neither solution (Clemens and Fowler) showed that the same quantity\r\n_Arsenicum brom._ is less poisonous (one has to be careful with the\r\nselection of animals, as many of them, especially ruminants, bear very\r\nlarge doses of Arsenic without injury). My preparation gives a rapid,\r\nnot destructive, but roborating action on every part of the body.\r\n\r\nIn doses of two to four drops daily, always to be taken in a full glass\r\nof water, it always shows its specific action as an antipsoricum.\r\nHerpetic eruptions and syphilitic excrescences or exanthemata dry up and\r\nheal up, while simultaneously the relaxed and thoroughly infected body\r\nsteadily increases in turgor vitals. Glandular tumors and indurations of\r\ndyscrasic origin, where any other treatment has failed, are scattered by\r\nthe long-continued use of my preparation. I have in suitable cases given\r\nit for years without noticing any hurtful sequelae, and after my patients\r\nwere cured I kept them under observation for years afterwards, and know,\r\ntherefore, that nothing injurious followed. This cannot be said of the\r\nusual arsenical preparations, and old Heim, a great admirer of Arsenic,\r\nopposed a lengthy use of it; he rather preferred larger doses, which is\r\nrather a dangerous procedure. Given for a long time for carcinoma, it\r\nstops the rapid progress of this fearful disease, and though at the same\r\ntime Chloride of arsenic was used externally, a real cure remained an\r\nimpossibility. My best successes were in obstinate cases of lues\r\ninveterata, in the first stages of tabes dorsalis (ataxie locomotrice),\r\nin the reconvalescence from exhausting acute diseases, in gastric\r\nsuppurations, inactivity of bowels, tardy digestion, constipation. In\r\ncases where _Chininum sulph._ failed in intermittent fevers, I prescribe\r\n_Brom. arsen._ twice daily, four drops, each time in a full glass of\r\nwater, gradually diminishing it to one daily dose, and in four weeks\r\neven the most obstinate cases yielded to this treatment. The patient\r\nfeels encouraged by his increasing vigor, the fever-cakes disappear, the\r\nbowels move regularly, and appetite leaves nothing to be desired. Those\r\nmean obstinate cases of intermittens larvata, often appearing in the\r\nform of unbearable neuralgiae, yield more rapidly to it than to the\r\nQuinine. It is often quite astonishing what good results can be obtained\r\nby the daily use of only one drop of this solution, kept up for a very\r\nlong time in dyscrasic constitutions, who spent a fortune to regain\r\ntheir health and failed with every other treatment. Its full solubility\r\nand rapid assimilation are the reason that it can be used without\r\ninjury, but it must be taken largely diluted. Let me give you a few\r\ncases for elucidation.\r\n\r\nSt., 46 years old, contracted syphilis several years ago and was\r\nrelieved of it by mercurial treatment and Zittman's decoction. About six\r\nyears ago he felt out of sorts, and a papular eruption appeared on\r\nforehead, temples, and especially at the root of the nose. Though\r\ntreatment was immediately instituted, still in a few weeks the face of\r\nthe patient was covered by an ugly, foul-smelling crust. Cod-liver oil\r\nwas now taken internally, and applied externally till the scuffs fell\r\noff and the eruption concentrated on three points. For six months that\r\ntreatment was kept up, but after being omitted for a few weeks, the\r\neruption spread again to its former extent. Every treatment was tried in\r\nrotation without the least benefit. In the spring 1856 he entered my\r\nclinic. In the centre of the forehead, at the root of the nose, on both\r\neyebrows, on the temples and right cheek there are moist herpetic\r\neruptions covered with crusts, exuding on least pressure an acrid ichor\r\nand easily bleeding. Around these eruptions the skin is injected,\r\nreddened, interspersed with a large network of veins. Cough and\r\nexpectoration hint to a beginning of tuberculosis, an heirloom in the\r\nfamily. Little appetite, disturbed digestion, tardy defecation, and\r\nevening fever. He is ordered Solutio arsen. brom. twice a day, four\r\ndrops in a glass of water, and already after two weeks the eruption\r\nbegins to dry up, appetite returns, and bowels are regular. A generous\r\ndiet and fresh meat several times a day are accessories to an arsenical\r\ncure. After two months two crusts fall off and the skin under them is\r\nsoft, shining, somewhat red. About July all eruption had gone, and the\r\ncough greatly improved. A few months ago I saw the patient again, and I\r\nfeel sure that the disease is eradicated.\r\n\r\nMiss W., 42 years old, passed her childhood in the West Indies, and\r\nbrought from there a peculiar skin disease. When I saw her for the first\r\ntime her features looked old for her age, skin gray and sallow, hair\r\ngray, rough, full of dandruff, and moisture oozing from the ears and\r\nforehead. The scalp feels hard and thickened. The cervical glands are\r\nindurated all around the neck. On the left chest an herpetic eruption of\r\nthe size of a dollar, and on the mamma a hard tumor of the size of a\r\nfist. For a year past this tumor began to be painful and sensitive to\r\npressure, and my advice was sought for relief of all her ailments,\r\nespecially as her hands were also in a fearful state, where the eruption\r\nlooked as if she had the itch. The nails were discolored, knobby, easily\r\nbleeding and covered with a gluey eruption. She had to wear and to\r\nchange gloves every day. For nine years she never entered society, as\r\nthe exhalation from her body disgusted even herself, and was hardly\r\nbearable, though sponging the whole body and daily renewal of linen was\r\nstrictly adhered to. In such an obstinate chronic psoric case treatment\r\nwith small doses is at first necessary, and _Arsen. brom._, two drops\r\ntwice daily, ordered, and her cold bath continued. After four weeks the\r\ndose was doubled, and after nine weeks the first glimmer of improvement\r\ncould be seen. The tumor in the mamma was smaller and painless, and\r\nwhere before it was so sensitive as to be covered with oil-silk she\r\ncould bear now the pressure of her clothing. After four months steady\r\ncontinuation of four drops twice daily, she was able to go without\r\ngloves. The scalp also was cleaner, less hard, and the ears more dry.\r\nBut with the return of spring the eruption gained new vigor. The head\r\nand hands became covered with suppurating nodules and small exuding\r\nherpetic spots, which became confluent and itched terribly, a most\r\nclassic picture of the herpes of the ancients. Though for years she had\r\nbeen accustomed to an aggravation in the spring, she never witnessed it\r\nin such severity. I now omitted the drug and ordered head and hands\r\nfrequently washed with cold water. After eight days the storm calmed\r\ndown, and it was remarkable to witness the steady decrease of the\r\ninduration in the cervical glands and mamma. After four weeks the old\r\ntreatment was renewed. During the summer months she took regularly her\r\nfour drops twice daily, and in the beginning of autumn the dose was\r\nreduced to two drops, and so continued during the whole winter. The\r\nfollowing spring crisis was the mildest one she ever experienced. During\r\nthe summer she took her four drops, during fall and winter two drops.\r\nThe third spring aggravation came with full severity, but lasted only\r\nthree days, when desquamation followed. Another year of the same\r\ntreatment and the fourth spring eruption showed itself slightly only in\r\nsmall papules behind the ears and between the fingers, and were hardly\r\nworth noticing. She now felt a slight weakness in right arm, which from\r\nchildhood up was rather weaker than the other one. After the\r\ndisappearance of the induration in the mamma the arm seemed to regain\r\nits former strength and the patient felt therefore rather astonished at\r\nthe reappearance of the weakness when its cause seemed removed, but it\r\nyielded readily to a mild constant current applied a few times, and some\r\nfaradic shocks each time from the shoulder through the arm, and in\r\nSeptember she went to Nizza in order to use sea-bathing, with the advice\r\nto take for a whole year one drop daily of her solution. She considered\r\nherself now well, but still her skin was flabby, especially on the hands\r\nwhere the epidermis often desquamated, and the nails remained hard,\r\nbrittle and without lustre.\r\n\r\nI may here remark that I found repeatedly Arsenic in the urine of such\r\npatients. A case of obstinate intermittens larvata, characterized by\r\nvomiting of chyme, also yielded to _Arsen. brom._ One case more must\r\nsuffice. A young man went to America but failed in his trade, and became\r\nbarkeeper on a Mississippi steamer, which place he had to give up on\r\naccount of intermittent fever. We find him then as hostler in Chicago\r\nwhere he was laid up with an attack of cholera, and as he did not fully\r\nrecover his strength he returned to the old home again. When I saw him\r\nfor the first time the diagnosis seemed to be first stage of Bright's\r\ndisease. Anamnesis, aetiology, and present state, albumen in the urine,\r\njustified the diagnosis. Patient is pale, bloated, oedema pedum, no\r\nappetite, white tongue, thin feverish pulse, swollen spleen, watery\r\ndiarrhoea alternating with constipation. Every drug produced vomiting,\r\nand he perfectly abhorred the old Quinine powders. I ordered four drops\r\n_Arsen. brom._ and a full meat diet. Improvement followed with the\r\ncontinuance of the treatment. After three weeks the spleen was reduced\r\nin size, his face showed better color, hardly any oedema. To\r\nstrengthen the skin he was advised to take pineneedle baths, and after\r\nthree months' treatment he could be discharged, a well man. He was\r\nadvised to take for a few months one drop daily of his solution, and to\r\ntake often an airing in the pineries which abound around Frankfort.\r\nThough he returned to America the latest reports from him are that he\r\nfeels again as well as ever, but he keeps his drops about him.\r\n\r\n_Arsen. brom._ is also a powerful remedy in diabetes mellitus and\r\ninsipidus, for I cured cases with it where the patient had already been\r\nreduced from 138 pounds to 98, and where the urine could be condensed,\r\nby boiling, into syrupy consistency. Mixed diet may be allowed, though I\r\ninsist upon large quantities of fresh meat during treatment with\r\n_Bromide of arsenic_. Let the patient take three drops thrice daily in a\r\nglass of water, and after a week the insatiable burning thirst will be\r\nquenched, and these doses must be continued till the quantity of sugar\r\nin the urine is reduced, when the drug might be taken twice a day and\r\ncontinued for a long time. A diabetic patient needs fresh pure air if he\r\nwishes to get well; confinement in a room or in the office prevents the\r\naction of any treatment, for it needs ozone to reduce the sugar of the\r\nblood into carbonic acid and water.\r\n\r\n\r\nASPIDOSPERMINE.[B]\r\n\r\n    [B] _Aspidospermine_ or _Quebrachine_ is derived from the\r\n    Chilian \"white Quebracho\" (_Aspidospermia Quebracho_). At\r\n    Santigo de Chile the bark is used as a substitute for\r\n    Cinchona as a febrifuge. The alkaloid forms salts with\r\n    Citric, Hydrochloric and Sulphuric acids.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Trituration of the alkaloid.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Edwin M. Hale communicated the following concerning\r\n     this alkaloid to the _Homoeopathic Recorder_ for 1889):\r\n\r\n_Dyspnoea._--This alkaloid is from the South American\r\ntree--_Quebracho_. The maximum dose, according to Merck, is 1/10th\r\ngrain. I use the 1/500th trituration, which I find most efficient in\r\ndoses of 2 to 5 grains.\r\n\r\nCASE I.--A boy of ten. The attacks of spasmodic dyspnoea were a sequel\r\nof hay fever. The aggravation was at night, when lying down, or sleep\r\nwas impossible. I tried _Ipecac_ and _Arsenic_, but with no effect.\r\n_Aralia_, also. (I never had any curative or palliative effects from\r\n_Aralia_.)\r\n\r\nPrescribed _Aspidospermine_, 1/500th trituration, 2 grains every two\r\nhours, all day. The night was comfortable, could lie down and sleep.\r\nContinued the remedy for four days, when he was so much better that the\r\nmedicine was suspended.\r\n\r\nCASE II.--Cardiac dyspnoea in a man of 60. Valvular disease,\r\nhypertrophy with dilatation. Distressing difficulty of breathing from\r\nthe slightest exertion; had to sit upright day and night. Face livid\r\nfrom venous stasis. _Strophanthus_ regulated and strengthened the\r\nheart's action, but only slightly benefited the dyspnoea. Five grains\r\nof _Aspidospermine_, 1/500th trituration, every two hours effected a\r\nmarvellous change. He could walk about the house and out to his carriage\r\nwith but little discomfort. He has now continued it three weeks.\r\nObserves no unpleasant symptoms. Can lie on his back and right side and\r\nis very grateful for the relief. It seems to act as well as an aid to\r\n_Digitalis_, or _Strophanthus_, in cardiac dyspnoea.\r\n\r\n\r\nAURUM MURIATICUM NATRONATUM.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME.--Chloride of Gold and Sodium.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--A mixture composed of equal parts of dry chloride of Gold\r\nand chloride of Sodium, triturated in the usual way.\r\n\r\n     (The following is an extract from a paper by Dr. H.\r\n     Goullon in the _Allg. Hom. Zeit._, bd. 114, No. 12, on\r\n     the therapeutics of this remedy):\r\n\r\nNever have I observed gold so startling in its action as in the\r\nfollowing case: The patient is a type of the scrofulous habit; reddish\r\nhair, pasty complexion, thick nose, coarse features. About thirty years\r\nof age. He has had the misfortune of being infected by syphilis, and the\r\nstill greater ill-luck of being treated by mercurial inunctions and\r\niodine to excess. All these circumstances conjoined helped to produce a\r\ncomplication of morbid conditions which would put medical art to a\r\nsevere test. Let us recall the region in which gold makes such brilliant\r\ncures, and we find it especially suitable in an uncommon swelling of the\r\nleft testicle. In this case I do not exaggerate, when I say that the\r\nscrotum was as large as a gourd of moderate size and the tumor was four\r\nor five times larger in circumference than the right testicle, which was\r\nalso swollen. The entire mass simulated an oblong, heavy weight, like\r\nthose one meets with in old-fashioned clocks, and could hardly find\r\nspace in the capacious suspensory.\r\n\r\nThe skin was also involved. On the elbow was a wide-spread herpetic\r\neruption; on different parts of the body were gummy indurations; the ear\r\ndischarged; in short, the many characteristic manifestations of the\r\nsyphilitic poison were to be seen throughout the cutaneous and mucous\r\nsystems. There were also ulcerous formations in the oral cavity and on\r\nthe sides of the tongue.\r\n\r\nAfter about four weeks the patient again set foot upon the floor,\r\nsaying: 'The drops have done wonders.' And indeed the influence upon the\r\ntesticles was so striking that now the right, which was formerly the\r\nsmaller, seemed the larger, without having actually at all increased in\r\nsize. Not the less remarkable had been the action of gold on the general\r\ncondition. The patient, formerly irritable and uneasy, is cheerful and\r\ncomfortable; enjoys sound sleep, whereas before he was disturbed with\r\nmorbid dreams; has lost his previous debility and disgust for\r\neverything; and says that his digestive power is quite a different\r\nthing. He assimilates articles of diet which he did not formerly dare to\r\ntake, unless he wished to suffer with flatulence, gastric acidity and\r\nvomiting. Among other things punch, which he 'could not even smell,'\r\nagrees well.\r\n\r\nBut, evidently, the mode of administering gold in such cases is not a\r\nmatter of indifference. And although I have only recently published a\r\ncure with high potencies (in which I subsequently corrected the mistake\r\nof the 100th _Dec._ for the _Centes._, which was what I used of the\r\n_Natrum muriaticum_), I cannot commit myself to high potencies in\r\nsyphilitic complications. Experience in these cases is always in favor\r\nof substantial doses. But, as we shall soon see, these proportionally\r\nmassive and heavy doses are always quite out of the allopathic\r\nposological range, and even on this ground one must set boundaries, and\r\nseek for the conversion of the traditional school. By two or three\r\nclinical experiences of this sort many a Saul would become a Paul in\r\nspite of all former prejudices, _vis inertia_, and most tormenting\r\nskepticism. One-half grain _Aurum muriaticum natronatum_ was dissolved\r\nin 6 grms. Spiritus vini, but of this first 6 drops are again put into a\r\nwineglass of water, of which the patient takes a teaspoonful thrice\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Tritschler, of the Gynaecological Clinic of Tuebingen,\r\n     furnishes the following on the use of this remedy in\r\n     diseases of women. From _Allg. Hom. Zeit._, bd. 94. Nos.\r\n     17. 18, 19):\r\n\r\nPermit me now to specify some practical instances of the curative powers\r\nof _Aurum_, and especially of _Aurum muriaticum natronatum_, in\r\nreference to gynaecology.\r\n\r\nCHRONIC METRITIS.\r\n\r\nThe first case is that of a woman with chronic metritis and prolapsus\r\nuteri. Hydrarg. chlorat. mit. was given at first, which acted favorably\r\non the inflammation, but whose further use was prevented by its giving\r\nrise to salivation. The intumescence of the uterus continued about the\r\nsame. Chloride of gold entirely reduced the chronic inflammation, and\r\nrestored the uterus to its natural position without external means.\r\n\r\nINDURATION OF UTERUS.\r\n\r\nThe second case was an unmarried woman at the climacteric, the vaginal\r\nportion of whose uterus showed an induration which disappeared during\r\nthe administration of chloride of gold.\r\n\r\nHYSTERICAL SPASMS.\r\n\r\nThe third case was a woman with periodical attacks of hysterical spasms,\r\nwhich involved the entire body, with unconsciousness lasting several\r\nhours, asthma, palpitation, etc., beginning with a sense of coldness,\r\nascending from the abdomen, and perceptible even to the bystanders.\r\nSometimes the attack began with pulsation through the occiput.\r\nExamination showed an inflamed uterus, filling not only the true pelvis,\r\nand interfering with urination and defecation, but the enlarged uterus\r\nperceptible through the thick abdominal walls above the pubes. At the\r\nend of seven months, _Aur. mur. nat._ had entirely reduced the swelling.\r\nThe woman has enjoyed good health for several years, quite free from the\r\nso-called hysteria.\r\n\r\nINDURATION OF CERVIX.\r\n\r\nIt happened that a woman presented an induration of the cervix, together\r\nwith a remarkable softening in the posterior uterine wall. The result of\r\ntreatment with chloride of gold was, that in proportion to the decrease\r\nof the induration there was an increase in the consistency of the\r\nsoftened posterior wall. The woman, who had been married for three years\r\nand childless, became pregnant for the first time and has since borne\r\nseveral children. With this experience, the Gold-chloride was also given\r\nfor a softening of the atrophied cervical canal, in one case until it\r\nwas curved at right angles to the body of the uterus; also in a diffused\r\nsoftening of the uterine tissues, with the result that the hitherto\r\nsterile woman, after toning up the uterine tissue, attained the joy of\r\nmotherhood. * * * * *\r\n\r\nHabitual abortion and premature labor recurring at about the same month\r\nof pregnancy generally depended upon induration in some portion of the\r\nuterus, which, preventing its natural expansion during gestation, gives\r\nrise to premature expulsion of the foetus. By the use of _Aur. mur.\r\nnat._ before and during pregnancy, the absorption of this induration\r\nwill conduce to the proper termination of parturition.\r\n\r\nA swelling of the ovary, reaching as far as the umbilicus, I have cured\r\nwith _Aur. mur. nat._, and have improved others of considerable extent\r\nvery decidedly. Martini has cured five cases of ovarian dropsy in the\r\ngreatest possible degree with the same remedy.\r\n\r\nUlcers of the os and the vaginal portion, which had resulted from\r\ninflammation and induration, some as large as a dollar, and of a\r\ngangrenous character, were healed by the use of gold, without any\r\ntopical applications.\r\n\r\nThe profession considers ulceration and induration of the uterus\r\nincurable. This dogma of theirs is based on the fact that the usual\r\nchange, the disturbance of nutrition, can neither be remedied nor\r\nhindered in its advance. Now since ulcers are generally found only in an\r\nadvanced stage of softening and induration, it is conceivable why the\r\nschool--seeking a cure solely in the use of local means--turns away\r\nalmost entirely from the employment of internal remedies. According to\r\nthe opinions of the specialists the use of different remedies, partly\r\ninsoluble, partly soluble, pure or in combination, permanent or\r\ntransient, is indicated. Others apply ointments on sponges to the\r\nsurface of the ulcers, keeping them in contact with it by tampons.\r\nOthers again prescribe injections, and with these expect to attain the\r\nend. Finally, glowing-hot iron, the galvano-cautery, or the knife and\r\nscissors remove partially or entirely the vaginal portion.\r\n\r\nNow, if the malady continues to thrive on the wounds made by these\r\nprocedures, if old cicatrices break out again, if too a permanent cure\r\nis out of the question, there is ground for supposing that the _product_\r\nof illness, the ulcer, may be cauterized, burnt and cut away, but that\r\nthe cause, the diathesis, the tendency to it, can only be removed by\r\ninternal medication. * * * * *\r\n\r\nCHRONIC METRITIS.\r\n\r\nOne day an official in Dresden brought his wife to me, who was 41 years\r\nof age. The couple, all of whose children had died soon after birth,\r\nlonged once more for children. The woman had aborted several times, and\r\nboth were intelligent enough to see that everything could not be right\r\nwith the sexual organs, and even begged for a gynaecological examination.\r\nThe result was in a few words: inflammation of both lips of the uterus,\r\na thickening of the cervical canal with a swelling of the posterior\r\nuterine wall as hard as cartilage, and retroversio uteri. Menstruation\r\ntoo early, dysmenorrhoea, blood dark, tarry, passing in clots.\r\nYellowish, fetid leucorrhoea. Stools retained, appetite changeable;\r\npains in the broad ligaments on both sides during rest as well as on\r\nexertion. The so-called \"facies uterina\"--weeps much. Frequent\r\nexclamations on the distastefulness of life since the death of all her\r\nchildren, and on account of her present childlessness. Should I register\r\nin my journal in the beginning of a scirrhus? I wrote simply: metritis\r\nchronica; intumescentia labiorum orificii et colli uteri.\r\n\r\nPrognosis, not unfavorable as far as regards the swelling, after my\r\nalready well-tested experience with _Aur. mur. nat._ But how about the\r\nremoval of sterility acquired in her 41st year. I was more cautious\r\nabout this. The cure took six months, and was not only accompanied by\r\nabsorption of the affected parts, but the woman became pregnant in good\r\ntime and gave birth to a boy with comparative comfort. Thus would the\r\nwishes of the worthy couple have been fulfilled, if their joy had not\r\nbeen banished once more by the death of the child in four weeks from an\r\nattack of eclampsia.\r\n\r\nANTEVERSION WITH PROLAPSUS.\r\n\r\nI now come in conclusion to a gratifying case, which I relate partly\r\nbecause we make ourselves guilty of sins of omission in certain\r\ninstances through neglect of the needful investigation. A woman in her\r\ntwentieth year, quite healthy, had been delivered with forceps for the\r\nfirst time two years before, nominally on account of deficient labor\r\npains. There was nothing unusual about the confinement. Immediately\r\nafter the first getting up, she began to have constant pain in the right\r\nside of the uterine region, and soon a feeling \"as if something would\r\nfall out of the parts.\" The family physician paid no attention to these\r\npersistent complaints for a whole year, until finally a constantly\r\nincreasing leucorrhoea demanded an examination. He now expressed\r\nhimself as unable to make a diagnosis alone, and the lady was referred\r\nto a celebrated gynaecologist in Leipsic. Cauterizations were now\r\nundergone at the professor's house at short intervals, and further\r\ntreatment of a similar character was to be carried out at the patient's\r\nown house, which was, however, discontinued when the patient was\r\nreferred to me. Examination showed: metritis following upon\r\nsub-involution of the uterus, anteversion with prolapsus of the whole\r\norgan. Both uterine lips were swollen, and on examination with the\r\nspeculum a greenish-yellow discharge was seen to flow from the uterus.\r\nAll local treatment was discontinued, the woman received for the first\r\ntime in April, 1876, _Aur. mur. nat._, and in June, 1876, again became\r\npregnant; the treatment with gold was continued until the 8th month of\r\npregnancy, in consequence of which the uterus was found in its normal\r\nposition on examination twelve days after her safe confinement on March\r\n30th. The menses, which up to this time had been very painful, returned\r\nfor the first time on the 25th of April, and were quite free from\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nBut now let us ask, whether we have in the salts of gold a simile for\r\nthe diseases of the female sexual organs under the comprehensive name of\r\nchronic metritis. We find in the homoeopathic proving, inflammatory\r\naffections of the internal organs; fainting depression and emaciation;\r\ngreat anxiety, sadness, dizziness, whimsical mood, weariness of life,\r\nmorbid desires, and headache; nausea, vomiting; pressure in the gastric\r\nregion; cardialgia, contractive, drawing pains in the abdomen.\r\n_Stitches in the left hypochondrium, pinching and burning in the right_,\r\nthe abdomen sensitive to touch, with distension; dull pains in the\r\nabdomen; drawing and stinging in the whole abdomen; eruption of small\r\npapules above the pubes; _decreased excretion of urine_, pressure on\r\nurinating, burning on urinating; redness, burning, swelling and moisture\r\nof the labia, _discharge of yellow mucus_, menstruation too soon and\r\nlasts too long; amenorrhoea; labor-like pains, as if the menses would\r\nappear; symptoms which certainly correspond to the whole picture of\r\nchronic metritis and its results.\r\n\r\nThe mode of administration which I have used for _Aur. mur. nat._ is in\r\ntrituration. Generally I have had the patient herself divide into three\r\nparts a 10 gr. powder of the 3d trit., and take one of these dry just\r\none hour after each meal. But I have also used the 1st and 2d\r\ntrituration. The effect cannot be seen before four weeks, hence I seldom\r\nmake a further examination before that time. Many women notice a\r\nremarkable increase of the appetite during the use of gold. After the\r\nadministration of the 1st trit. I have observed frequent, dark stools.\r\nAn increase in the urine with a thick, gray sediment is often seen.* * *\r\n\r\nUTERINE DISEASES.\r\n\r\nUterine diseases, according to my experience of many years, make more\r\nmarriages unfruitful than all the other known or fancied hindrances to\r\nchild-bearing. They can exist many years even with a blooming\r\nappearance, without apparently disturbing the general health, and on\r\nthat account are often overlooked and mistaken by physicians themselves,\r\nwho are not concerned about gynaecological examinations, or else make\r\nonly superficial investigations, not having their eyes at the ends of\r\ntheir fingers. I beg, therefore, if this communication should give rise\r\nto a more extensive use of _Aur. mur. nat._, above all things, a\r\nthorough gynaecological examination, not leaving this to the so-called\r\nsurgeons and midwives. If women complain of gastric troubles, dizziness,\r\npain in the loins and back, disturbances of urination or defecation,\r\nwith a more or less pronounced hysterical appearance, and withal\r\npurposely or unwittingly deceive themselves and the physician; if, added\r\nto these, leucorrhoea and a sensation as if everything would drop out\r\nof the abdominal cavity, one may say of the patient that her uterus is\r\ndiseased, and may base upon that his proposal for an examination, which\r\nwill give the correct information of the nature of the malady. As a\r\nrule, every deep-seated, morbid alteration in the uterine tissues\r\nentails suffering upon the nervous system, which, being in such close\r\nrelation with the uterus, not seldom apparently suffers the most.\r\n\r\nHYSTERIA.\r\n\r\nBecause the uterus receives its nerves from the sympathetic system,\r\nwhich governs nutrition, circulation, respiration with distribution of\r\nanimal heat, gestation, etc., these functions being out of sight, it is\r\ndifficult to get at the root of the matter as regards the uterus in a\r\nsuffering woman. Her sensations and fancies offer, according to her\r\neducation, organization, etc., a wide field in which to make her a\r\nburden to herself and others. Her mind is generally out of order, she\r\nknows not why. In the more advanced stages of disease, the functions of\r\nthe higher nervous system, the organs of sense, and even the mental\r\nactivities are disordered. Then appears that chameleon of diseases,\r\nwhich goes by the name of _hysteria_, suitable in so far as hysteria\r\nalmost without exception takes root in the \"hystera\" or uterus. I shall\r\ncertainly not deny the possibility of primary or purely nervous diseases\r\nof the uterus, hysteria sine materia; I am nevertheless convinced that\r\nin at least nine cases out of ten, hysteria depends upon objective,\r\nsensible, perceptible changes in the uterus. It is these whose existence\r\nI ascertain by a thorough examination, and according to these that I\r\nregulate my treatment; they give me in every case a more certain\r\nstarting point than a lengthy account of true and imaginary suffering.\r\nIf I find, however, no palpable abnormality in the tissue to remove,\r\nand prescribe _Aur. mur. nat._ simply as an excellent nervine,\r\nfollowing Niemeyer, it occasionally does good, but generally leaves me\r\nin the lurch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVENA SATIVA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Graminaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Oats.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh green plant, gathered in August, is pounded to a\r\npulp and macerated with two parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Comparatively little has been written concerning this\r\n     remedy, the tincture of oats. It acquired a bad\r\n     reputation somewhere in the \"eighties\" by being\r\n     advertised as a proprietary remedy making wonderful\r\n     cures, but analysis showed the advertised \"avena\" to\r\n     contain opium. The following outline of the drug is by\r\n     Dr. E. H. Russell, in _North American Journal of\r\n     Homoeopathy_):\r\n\r\n_Avena sativa_ is pre-eminently an anti-neurotic, quieting the nervous\r\nsystem to a remarkable degree. Its special sphere of action seems to be\r\nupon the male sexual organs, regulating the functional irregularities of\r\nthese parts perhaps as much as any drug can. It is a most useful remedy\r\nin all cases of nervous exhaustion, general debility, nervous\r\npalpitation of the heart, insomnia, inability to keep the mind fixed\r\nupon any one subject, etc., more especially when any or all of these\r\ntroubles is apparently due to nocturnal emissions, masturbation, over\r\nsexual intercourse, and the like. For these disorders it is truly\r\nspecific. It is one of the most valuable means for overcoming the bad\r\neffects of the morphine habit. In most cases in which the habitue has\r\nnot used more than four grains daily the opiate may be abruptly\r\ndiscontinued, and even substituted, without any serious results. If a\r\nlarger quantity than this amount has been taken for some time, it is\r\nbetter to gradually reduce the daily dose of morphine, in the usual\r\nmanner, simply prescribing the _Avena_ in addition. The latter should\r\nbe given in the same dose, as a rule, regardless of the amount of\r\nmorphine taken. In other words, it is not necessary to increase the\r\n_Avena_ as the opiate is withdrawn. When the quantity of morphine has\r\nnot exceeded four grains daily it should be stopped at once, as stated\r\nabove, and _Avena_ given in its stead in fifteen-drop doses, four times\r\na day, in a wineglassful of hot water. By this method the disagreeable\r\nafter-effects will be much less than though the dose of morphine is\r\ngradually reduced, and the patient will find life quite bearable, as a\r\nrule, at the end of a week.\r\n\r\n_Avena sativa_ should always be given in appreciable doses of the\r\ntincture. Fifteen drops three or four times a day, well diluted, will\r\nusually meet the case. It may be given in doses of from five to sixty\r\ndrops in rare instances. It should, however, never be given in larger\r\nquantities than twenty minims unless the patient is thoroughly\r\naccustomed to the remedy, and has found the usual dose insufficient.\r\nOtherwise there is danger of getting the physiological effect of the\r\ndrug, which is _pain at the base of the brain_. When this symptom makes\r\nits appearance the medicine should be discontinued for a day or two, and\r\nthen given in reduced doses. There seems to be no danger whatever of\r\nforming the habit of taking this drug, as it can be suddenly abandoned\r\nat any time without evil consequences, even when given in large\r\nquantities. In one case it was prescribed by the writer in sixty-drop\r\ndoses, night and morning, _for one year_, and then abruptly stopped,\r\nnothing being substituted therefore, without bad effects.\r\n\r\nWhenever a quick action is desired, and in all cases where _Avena_ is\r\ngiven to overcome the morphine habit, it should be prepared in hot\r\nwater. It is also a good plan to prescribe it in this fashion wherever\r\nindigestion complicates the case.\r\n\r\nThe writer has employed this drug in his private practice for a number\r\nof years with the most gratifying results. He has very rarely found it\r\nto fail when indicated, and on account of his high opinion of the\r\nremedy he has taken great pleasure in thus bringing it prominently to\r\nthe attention of the medical profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nAZADIRACHTA INDICA.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh bark is pounded to a pulp and macerated in two\r\nparts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following synopsis of _Azadirachta Ind._, is\r\n     contributed by P. C. Majumdar, M. D., of Calcutta,\r\n     India):\r\n\r\n_Azadirachta Indica._ Syn.: Sanskrit, Nimba; Bengala and Hindi, Nim.\r\nBelongs to the natural order Meliaeae. It is a large tree. Bark is used\r\nfor making tinctures from which provings were instituted. The leaves,\r\nbark, wood, roots and fruits, in short, every part of this tree, is\r\nintensely bitter. According to Ayurveda (Hindu System of Medicine) the\r\ndifferent parts of this tree possess different medicinal properties.\r\nBhava Misra, Charak, Susratha and several other Sanskrit authors agree\r\nthat its bark, though very disagreeable in taste, is generally used with\r\nsuccess in cases of lassitude, thirst, cough, fever, loss of appetite,\r\nhelmenthiasis, boils, bilious derangements, catarrh, vomiting, cutaneous\r\ndiseases, hiccough, gonorrhoea, etc.; its leaves are used in some\r\nforms of ophthalmic disease, helmenthiasis and disorders brought on by\r\nderanged bile or use of poisonous things. A decoction of fresh leaves is\r\nused as a favorite wash to cure old ulcers of long standing. It removes\r\nwithin a short time the sloughs and promotes the healing. The fruit is\r\npurgative, demulcent, and is used in some forms of cutaneous affections.\r\nA kind of oil is produced from the seed of ripe fruits, and this oil is\r\nsaid to cure lepra, eczema and some other obstinate skin diseases.\r\n\r\nNim is also praised by some of the Allopathic physicians for its tonic,\r\nantiseptic, astringent and anti-periodic properties. Its febrifuge\r\naction is well-known in our country. Kanirages (native physicians) use\r\nNim as the principal substance in their febrifuge medicines. The vast\r\nrange of its action is chiefly due to azaderine, margocine and katechin,\r\nthe three active principles found in this tree. Nim was proved by me and\r\none of my students, U. C. Bagchi. A full report of the proving was\r\npublished in the _Indian Homoeopathic Review_, Vol. iii, No. 1. Here I\r\ngive the most reliable and peculiar symptoms obtained in its proving.\r\n\r\nMind: Depressed and forgetful, mistakes in writing and spelling words,\r\nweak and dull, full of anxiety, inactive, could not think or remember\r\nnames of persons very familiar, or what has been done in the previous\r\nday.

Sudamina on the back.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACILLINUM, TUBERCULINUM AND AVIAIRE, THE VIRUSES OF TUBERCULOSIS.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Triturate in the usual way.\r\n\r\n     (The literature on these several preparations is so\r\n     extensive that we must confine ourselves to the paper\r\n     read by Dr. Francois Cartier, Physician to the Hospital\r\n     St. Jacques, Paris, at the International Homoeopathic\r\n     Congress, 1896, it covering the ground more completely\r\n     than any other. For fuller information on _Bacillinum_\r\n     the reader is referred to Dr. J. Compton Burnett's book,\r\n     the _New Cure for Consumption_.)\r\n\r\nI must disclaim any intention of traversing afresh the pathogenesy of\r\n_Tuberculin_, or of instituting an examination into the various\r\ntreatises put forth on the subject of the virus of tuberculosis by the\r\nallopathic as well as by the homoeopathic school.\r\n\r\nThe materia medica of _Tuberculin_ takes its rise in the complex result\r\nof the use of Koch's lymph, in experiments upon animals, and in certain\r\nsymptoms observed by those who have experimented upon themselves with\r\ndifferent products of tuberculous nature. I shall therefore indicate the\r\npublished sources, and I specially desire to place before the\r\nHomoeopathic Congress of London the tuberculous virus under certain\r\naspects which are perhaps new; and if my conclusions seem somewhat\r\nparadoxical I am content to accept, with a good grace, the criticisms of\r\nmy colleagues.\r\n\r\nFourteen years anterior to the researches of Koch, Hering, Swan and\r\nBiegler availed themselves, as a homoeopathic remedy, of the\r\nmaceration of tuberculous lungs, and of the sputa of tuberculous\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Compton Burnett in his book, \"A Cure for Consumption,\" several\r\nyears before Koch's experiments, noticed symptoms resulting from taking\r\nthe preparation which he calls _Bacillinum_.\r\n\r\nDrs. de Keghel[C] and J. H. Clarke[D] instituted an inquiry into the\r\nsymptoms produced by the employment of Koch's lymph in the case of\r\ntuberculous and non-tuberculous patients.\r\n\r\n    [C] _L' Union Homeopathique_, vol. v, No. 3.\r\n\r\n    [D] _Homoeopathic World_, vol. xxvi, No. 304.\r\n\r\nDr. Mersch[E] published a pathogenesy, based to a large extent upon that\r\nof Dr. de Keghel; it is an excellent work.\r\n\r\n    [E] \"On Tuberculin,\" an extract from the _Journal Belge d'\r\n    homeopathie_, 1895.\r\n\r\nDr. d'Abzen,[F] of Lisbon, sent to the Tuberculosis Congress of 1895, at\r\nCoimbra, a study of the works of Koch and Pasteur, and an enumeration of\r\nthe treatises published by homoeopathists.\r\n\r\n    [F] _Pathogenese, sua importancia._\r\n\r\nWe must notice also an English translation of Dr. Mersch's pathogenesy,\r\nby Dr. Arnulphy, of Chicago, in which special attention is paid to the\r\nsymptoms observed in healthy and non-tuberculous persons, with some\r\noriginal remarks about _Tuberculin_. It is published in the _Clinique_\r\nfor this year (February, 1896).\r\n\r\nNor must we overlook a series of writers who have published isolated\r\nobservations of the cases of persons cured with _Tuberculin_. Such are\r\nDrs. Lambreghts, Joussett, Zoppritz, Horace Holmes, Richardson, Young,\r\nClarke, Pinart, Youman, U. H. Merson, Snow, Lamb, Clarke, Ebersole, W.\r\nJames, Kunkel, A. Zoppritz, Steinhauf, Van den Berghe, &c.\r\n\r\nFinally, for my own part, in my articles in _L'Art Medical_, published\r\nthree years ago, and in the _Hahnemannian Monthly_ (July, 1894), I have\r\ninsisted on homoeopathic action of the viruses of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nIn certain of the pathogenesies of _Tuberculin_ we find thrown pell-mell\r\ntogether symptoms appertaining to Koch's lymph, as well as others which\r\nbelong to the product baptized by several names, such as _Bacillinum_\r\nand _Tuberculin_, in the recommendation of which Hering and Swan, and\r\nDr. J. Compton Burnett, in England, have made themselves conspicuous.\r\n\r\n_Bacillinum_--since it must be distinguished from Koch's\r\n_Tuberculin_--is a maceration of a typical tuberculous lung.[G] Koch's\r\nlymph is an extract in glycerine of dead tuberculous bacilli. The former\r\nis compound natural infection; the latter is a product of laboratory\r\nexperiment. In the one, various bacteriological species are associated\r\nwhich give, clinically, an appearance of cachexia and of hectic fever;\r\nfrom the other we may sometimes observe vascular, cardiac, renal changes\r\nhaving no connection with the clinical \"syndrome\" of pulmonary\r\ntuberculosis. To place these products together in the same pathogenesy\r\ngives an absolutely wrong sense, and the fact that both contain Koch's\r\nbacillus gives no excuse for confounding them. In my opinion there are,\r\nfrom a homoeopathic point of view, distinct differences between\r\n_Bacillinum_ and the Koch's lymph.\r\n\r\n    [G] Dr. J. Compton Burnett, in his book, \"New Cure for\r\n    Consumption,\" p. 129, makes this remark: \"The best way to get\r\n    some really good _Bacillinum_ is to take a portion of the\r\n    lung of an individual who has died of genuine bacillary\r\n    tuberculosis pulmonum, choosing a good-sized portion from the\r\n    parietes of the cavity and its circumjacent tissue, as herein\r\n    will be found everything pertaining to the tuberculous\r\n    process--bacilla, _debris_, ptomaines and tubercles in all\r\n    its stages (such was practically the origin of the matrix of\r\n    my _Bacillinum_) and preparing by trituration in spirit. In\r\n    this way nothing is lost.\"\r\n\r\nExperimentally Koch's bacillus, like many other microbes, does not\r\nreproduce a clinical symptom-group; and we homoeopaths must have an\r\nassemblage of clearly-defined symptoms before prescribing a poison on\r\nhomoeopathic principles. Such is unfortunately the case with many\r\nother microbes in pure culture. The experimental diphtheria does not\r\nresemble clinical diphtheria. The pneumococcus, pathogenetic of\r\npneumonia, is met with in many other diseases, such as pleurisy,\r\nsalpingitis, meningitis, etc. Koch's bacillus, too, sometimes remarkably\r\nmild in its effects, and seeming to meet with no reaction in the system,\r\nevolves aside as in the verrucous tuberculosis; while at other times\r\nnothing is able to arrest the action of this terrible microbe, and the\r\nworld still waits in vain for the man who shall find the means of\r\ncombatting it. The toxins of tuberculosis are far from reproducing\r\nclinical tuberculosis; yet even here we find a curious aspect sometimes\r\nassumed by certain poisons drawn from the pure cultivation of microbes.\r\nWe cannot produce with _Tuberculin_ symptoms analogous to those of real\r\ntuberculosis--as it is possible, for instance, to produce tetanus with\r\nthe toxine alone, _Tetanin_.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, in the case of a healthy man, Koch's lymph would not\r\ndevelop any reaction, its effects manifesting themselves in a febrile\r\ncongestion, which betrays the presence of tubercles. In our pathogeneses\r\n(those of Mersch-Arnulphy), we note the following symptoms--\"catarrhal\r\npneumonia with soft hepatisation, and tendency to abscess formation; at\r\npost-mortems it is not a gelatinous or fibrinous exudation which oozes\r\nout from the alveoli, but an opaque and watery fluid; 'never,' so says\r\nVirchow, 'is there found the characteristic lesion of croupous\r\npneumonia.'\" A pneumonia from which issues an aqueous and opaque\r\nliquid! I confess I do not understand it.\r\n\r\nExperimentally this same lymph of Koch gives symptoms of inflammation of\r\nthe arteries which are not found in clinical tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nAnimals inoculated with progressive doses of _Avian tuberculin_, or with\r\nserum of tuberculous animals, undergo wasting and loss of appetite, and\r\nother general symptoms. They may die of cachexia, or may develop an\r\nisolated abscess; but they do not present characteristic symptoms as\r\nthey would under the action of _Cantharis_, of _Phosphorus_, or of\r\n_Lead_.\r\n\r\nFinally, inoculation with dead bacilli may produce real tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nIn the pathogenesy put forth by homoeopathists, pulmonary symptoms do\r\nnot occupy a prominent place. Dr. Burnett, who has experimented on\r\nhimself with _Bacillinum_, notes at the end of his symptoms, after the\r\nheadache, a slight and almost insignificant cough.\r\n\r\nIn explaining the clinical forms of infectious complaints, we are\r\nfrequently forced to admit the increasingly preponderant part played by\r\nassociation of microbes--as it is the frequent case in diphtheria--and\r\nespecially the modifications which depend directly on the disposition of\r\nthe organ attacked, and not upon the action of the microbe itself.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the above considerations leads me to the following\r\nconclusions:\r\n\r\n1. That the importance of the materia medica of the tubercular virtues\r\nought not to be exaggerated. There are few characteristic symptoms to\r\ntake off; it is more wise to guide oneself in the homoeopathic\r\napplication of the therapeutics by the clinical symptoms of the\r\nevolution of the various tuberculosis, rather than by the intoxication\r\nproduced by their active products, the _Tuberculins_.\r\n\r\n2. Koch's lymph, _Bacillinum_ and _Avian tuberculin_ must be studied\r\nseparately, clinically as well as experimentally. _Bacillinum_ presents\r\nsymptoms very different from those of _Avian tuberculin_, and\r\nespecially from those of Koch's lymph; and I intend to divide my remarks\r\ninto three parts, corresponding to these three substances, which have\r\nactually become homoeopathic remedies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the time of the introduction of the ever-memorable Koch's lymph,\r\nthere were included under the head of poisonings by this drug vascular\r\nlesions, as I have mentioned above, acute arteritis, arterio-sclerosis,\r\nchanges in the vessels of the heart and the kidneys, and acute\r\nnephritis. Apropos of acute nephritis, the supposition was that the\r\nkidney became congested because of the presence in that part of certain\r\ntubercular islets, and that the kidney responded, like the tuberculous\r\nlung, under the influence of the _Tuberculin_, by acute congestion.\r\n\r\nHowever this might be, these vascular lesions drew attention to the\r\nhomoeopathicity of Koch's lymph in nephritis. Dr. Jousset has\r\nexperimented in it with encouraging results, using homoeopathic\r\ndilutions, in Bright's disease; and at the meeting of the Societe\r\nHomoeopathique Francaise on April 18, 1895, Drs. Tessier, Silva and\r\nJousset, father and son, mentioned the diminution of albumen in cases of\r\nchronic and incurable nephritis, and the appearance of that substance in\r\nacute cases.\r\n\r\nDr. Arnulphy, in a series of articles in the Chicago _Clinique_, which I\r\nhave read attentively, speaks favorably of Koch's lymph in\r\nhomoeopathic dilutions in cases of tuberculosis. Personally I have not\r\nused it, and I am loth to pass judgment on observations recorded in\r\nevery good faith. I would merely remark to my honorable colleague that\r\nKoch's lymph was used in our school in all the homoeopathic dilutions\r\npossible at the moment of its far-resounding discovery--a fact which he\r\nshould know as well as myself. To mention only one instance--Drs. Simon,\r\nV. L. Simon Boyer and Chancerel used the drug at the Hahnemann Hospital\r\nin Paris at the time of the arrival in France of the first consignment\r\nof lymph from Germany; and I am nearly certain that there is not at this\r\ntime a single country where homoeopathists have not used this remedy\r\nin all the infinitesimal dilutions. Homoeopaths and allopaths have\r\nactually taken pretty much the same side as regards the primitive\r\nformula put forward by Koch (I am not now speaking of trials of new\r\ntuberculins); and Dr. Arnulphy would be fortunate enough were he able to\r\nrevive its credit after its several years' oblivion as a cure of\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\nClinically this lymph of Koch has led to wonderful cures in lobular\r\npneumonia, for it produces pneumonia, broncho pneumonia, and congestion\r\nof the lungs in the tuberculous patient. Its homoeopathic action would\r\nthus appear more trustworthy than its isopathic, and Dr. Arnulphy makes\r\nthis remark: \"I make bold to state that no single remedy in our materia\r\nmedica, not excepting _Ipecac_, _Iodine_, _Tartar emetic_, and even\r\n_Phosphorus_, approaches the singular efficacy of _Tuberculin_ in\r\nwell-authenticated cases of that affection (broncho pneumonia, be it) in\r\nthe child, the adult, or the aged. Its rapidity of action in some cases\r\nis little short of wonderful, and all who have used it in this line are\r\nunanimous in their unbounded praise of its working.\"\r\n\r\nThe four cases quoted by Dr. Mersch (_Journal Belge d' Homeopathie_,\r\nNovember, 1894, January and May, 1895) are very instructive:\r\n\r\nThe first is that of a member of the Dutch Parliament who had contracted\r\na pneumonia which reached a chronic stage. While undergoing a relapse\r\nhis expectoration assumed a rusty-red color, which color disappeared\r\ncompletely in three days on treatment with _Tuberculin_ 30th.\r\n\r\nThe second case is that of a person who was seized, after an attack of\r\nmeasles, with broncho-pneumonia. On the fifth day Dr. Mersch prescribed\r\n_Tuberculin_ 6th. In a day or two the condition of the chest was\r\ncompletely altered.\r\n\r\nIn the third case an old lady was likewise attacked with\r\nbroncho-pneumonia, together with digestive troubles, and was for a long\r\ntime in a serious state. After the lapse of a single night, which was a\r\nrather distressing one, under the action of the remedy the amelioration\r\nwas great, and it was with difficulty that Dr. Mersch found a touch of\r\nbronchitis in the very place where the day before he had heard nothing\r\nbut the tubular _souffle_. The prescription ran: _Tuberculin_ 6th, eight\r\npackets of ten globules each, one to be taken every two hours.\r\n\r\nFinally, in a fourth case, the patient was a lady of vigorous physique,\r\nand twenty-five years of age, who had capillary bronchitis, combined\r\nwith the symptoms of angina pectoris. Dr. Mersch had once more had an\r\nopportunity of viewing with astonishment the rapidity with which the\r\ntherapeutic action of _Tuberculin_ may be manifested in such cases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Bacillinum_ deserves study from two points of view, isopathically in\r\nthe treatment of tuberculosis, homoeopathically in the treatment of\r\naffections of the respiratory organs without tuberculosis. To fully\r\nunderstand its action it is necessary to know with exactness its\r\ncomposition. Dr. J. Compton Burnett has christened it _Bacillinum_,\r\nbecause he recognized in its lower dilutions the presence of Koch's\r\nbacilli. As a matter of fact, _Bacillinum_ contains in its elements\r\neverything that a cavity of a tuberculous lung is capable of containing;\r\nthat is to say, many other things besides Koch's bacillus. The bacillus\r\nof Koch is feebly pyogenetic, and the purulent contents of the cavities\r\ninclude pyogenetic staphylococci and streptococci, to say nothing of the\r\norganic products which play a large part in the production of the hectic\r\nfever of tuberculosis. It is a combination of toxins, then, which\r\nconstitutes _Bacillinum_, and especially of toxins of a purulent nature.\r\nI lay stress upon this last fact, as it goes to sustain the opinion that\r\nI hold on the action of _Bacillinum_.\r\n\r\nThe infinitesimal dose of Homoeopathy is in no way inimical to the\r\nentrance of all the elements constituting a substance into its materia\r\nmedica. The salts of potassium owe their effect to their base as well\r\nas to their acid; _Graphites_ is analogous to _Carbo_ and _Ferrum_,\r\nbecause it contains both carbon and iron; _Hepar sulphuris calcareum_\r\nacts by reason of its sulphur as well as of its lime. _Bacillinum_,\r\nthen, combines in its action all its constituent products, owing its\r\nefficacy to its suppurative microbes as well as its inclusion of Koch's\r\nbacillus.\r\n\r\nThis method of viewing the matter, which is peculiar to myself, permits\r\nme to include in one and the same category the action of _Bacillinum_ in\r\nconsumption and its action in non-tuberculous bronchitis.\r\n\r\nI have studied conscientiously the action of _Bacillinum_ in\r\ntuberculosis, and I must confess that I am looking out still for an\r\nauthentic case of cure by this remedy. Nevertheless, in the midst of the\r\npaucity of drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis, I am happy to state\r\nthat _Bacillinum_ has produced in my hands considerable amelioration of\r\nthe symptoms of this disease. Perhaps in certain cases it produces what\r\nBernheim would call \"la treve tuberculeuse.\" But sooner or later the\r\ndrug, after ameliorating the symptoms, loses its effect, and the disease\r\nagain gets the upper hand. I wish I could be as optimistic as Dr. J.\r\nCompton Burnett in his interesting book, \"A New Cure for Consumption;\"\r\nbut that is impossible.\r\n\r\nIn looking over my observations I find that the symptom which has always\r\nundergone the greatest mitigation has been the _expectoration_. When\r\n_Bacillinum_ acts on tuberculosis the sputum is less abundant, less\r\npurulent, less green, and more a[=e]rated. It is this which has always\r\nstruck me most in the action of _Bacillinum_. It is rarely that a\r\npatient satisfied with the remedy fails to remark, \"I expectorate less.\"\r\nIn cases of dry cough at the beginning of tuberculosis I have noticed\r\nthat the drug evidently arrests the tubercular process.\r\n\r\nI would most severely criticise, as well for myself as for others, cases\r\nof so-called \"cure of tuberculosis.\" There certainly are persons in whom\r\nthe disease does not develop. These may have been accidentally\r\ninfected, and their phagocytes may have struggled against their microbe\r\nfoe. But in the case of an individual in whom the tubercle finds a\r\nsuitable field for development, it is the merest chance that he entirely\r\nrecovers without ulterior relapse; mostly it is a seeming cure, caused\r\nby a time of pause in the microbian pullulation.\r\n\r\nLast year I had under my care, at the Hospital St. Jacques, a truly\r\nextraordinary case. It has been followed out by Dr. Jousset, by Dr.\r\nCesar, head of the hospital laboratory, and by the house-physicians. It\r\nwas that of a woman who entered the hospital suffering from influenza,\r\nand who, a few days after a slight amelioration of her symptoms, was\r\nattacked with a pulmonary congestion, clearly localized in the top of\r\nthe left lung, and accompanied by all the clinical symptoms of\r\ntuberculosis--rales and moist crepitation, dulness, exaggeration of the\r\nthoracic vibration, nummular expectoration, fever, perspiration,\r\nspitting of blood--everything was there. Examination of the sputa showed\r\ndistinctly the presence of Koch's bacilli. Everyone at the hospital\r\ndiagnosed tuberculosis, myself the first. I gave her _Avian tuberculin_\r\nand in three weeks all the symptoms had disappeared. That woman left the\r\nhospital completely cured, and _a year afterwards_ her health was still\r\nperfect. In my opinion this patient never had consumption; she was\r\nattacked with pseudo-phymic bronchitis, a complication which is very\r\noften found with influenza, and which may very easily be mistaken for\r\ntuberculosis; and in spite of the presence in the sputa of Koch's\r\nbacillus I would not register it as a case of tuberculosis, because, in\r\ncontradistinction to that single case, I could mention twenty cases of\r\ntuberculosis whose symptoms neither _Avian tuberculin_ nor any other\r\nsuch drug has cured.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no connection between the clinical evolution of real\r\ntuberculosis and observations based on the autopsies of old persons\r\nwhose lungs contain cavities, but whose death was not due to\r\ntuberculosis. To admit, with Professor Brouardel, that three-fourths of\r\nthose who have died a violent death are possessed of tuberculous\r\nlesions, whose existence was not suspected while the subject was living,\r\nwould be running absolutely counter to clinical experience. The time is\r\nprobably at hand when the different kinds of tuberculosis will be\r\ndistinguished and separated, as we distinguish and separate the varieties\r\nof serious pleurisy and purulent pleurisy, of broncho-pneumonia arising\r\nfrom the presence of pneumococci, of streptococci, or of staphylococci.\r\nMalassez has already described cases of pseudo-tuberculosis, or\r\nzoogleic-tuberculosis, whose existence has only been acknowledged of\r\nlate years. Courmont has discovered a pseudo-bacillosis of a bovine\r\norigin. We have a pseudo-bacillosis of a strepto bacillar origin, not to\r\nmention the \"professional\" tuberculoses, such as that to which persons\r\nare exposed who have to breathe the fumes of charcoal.\r\n\r\nTo return to _Bacillinum_, I consider this remedy as a powerful\r\nmoderator of the muco-purulent secretion of consumption. While\r\ndiminishing the secretion it modifies the auscultation; there is less\r\nthick sputum, the cavities are drier, the peri-tuberculosis congestion\r\nless intense. The clinical symptoms follow those of the auscultation; as\r\nthe patient expectorates less he is less feeble, coughs less, gains\r\nstrength, and regains his spirits; but the tubercle remains untouched.\r\nThe peri-tuberculous congestion only is diminished, as one may observe\r\nwith the naked eye when Koch's lymph is employed in the amelioration of\r\nlupus. The peri-tuberculous inflammation disappears; the skin seems\r\nhealthy, but the yellow tubercle remains as it was, and the patient is\r\nstill uncured. Such are the limits I assign to _Bacillinum_ in its\r\naction on consumption.\r\n\r\nFar more potent is the part played by _Bacillinum_ in non-tuberculous\r\npulmonary affections, for the simple reason that the struggle is with a\r\nless redoubtable opponent. Ebersole, Young, Zoppritz, Burnett, James,\r\nHolmes, Jousset, Steinhauf have published cases of the cure of acute\r\nbronchitis, influenza diarrhoea, syphilitic eruptions, cystitis,\r\nringworm of the scalp, nephritis, idiocy, retarded dentition, cretinism,\r\ngout, rheumatism, etc., with _Tuberculin_ or _Bacillinum_.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to prescribe _Bacillinum_ successfully in non-tuberculous\r\naffections, we must observe, on auscultation, symptoms analogous to\r\nthose which are perceptible in tuberculosis. The peculiar\r\ncharacteristics which indicate _Bacillinum_ for non-tuberculous maladies\r\nof the respiratory organs are, in my opinion, the two following: The\r\nfirst is _oppression_; the second, _muco purulent_ expectoration. These\r\ntwo phenomena show themselves always in the last stage of tuberculosis;\r\nthat is to say, together with the products contained in the preparation\r\nof _Bacillinum_. _Dyspnoea resulting from bronchial and pulmonary\r\nobstruction caused by a super-abundant secretion from the mucous\r\nmembrane is marvellously relieved by Bacillinum._ I put forward this\r\nfact, not on the evidence of a single isolated observation, but on that\r\nof several cases conscientiously studied. Such expectoration leads to\r\nthe auscultation of sub-crepitant rales, sounding liquid and gurgling,\r\nhaving some analogy to the moist sounds of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nThis power of _Bacillinum_ to relieve oppression in pulmonary catarrh is\r\nin no way surprising from the point of view of the law of similars; for\r\nin the acute and infectious stage of tuberculosis the dyspnoea is a\r\ncharacteristic symptom, and is far more distressing than the cough. I\r\nhave read with pleasure in the work of Dr. Mersch, of Brussels, on\r\n_Tuberculin_, of a fact which corroborates my statement as to the\r\ninfluence of _Bacillinum_ over catarrhal dyspnoea. After the sixth\r\ndose the patient, who was suffering from bronchial asthma, was seized\r\nwith violent intercostal pains, with augmented cough; but the oppression\r\nentirely disappeared after the first day, and did not return even three\r\nmonths after the treatment had ceased.\r\n\r\nIn _L' Art Medical_ of January, 1894, and in the _Hahnemannian Monthly_\r\nof July, 1894, I published the case of an old man of eighty years of\r\nage, suffering from broncho-pneumonia, who, in the last stage of\r\nasphyxia, had been saved by _Bacillinum_. Two years ago I was called\r\nupon to treat another octogenarian who, as the result of a cold,\r\ndeveloped an obstruction in the bronchial tubes, and at the basis of the\r\nlungs. He passed sleepless nights in a sitting posture, striving to draw\r\ndeep inspirations. _Phosphorus_, _Arsenic_, and _Stibium_ produced no\r\nrelief. I gave him _Bacillinum_ 30th, and he slept the whole night\r\nthrough. Doses of this remedy, administered _at longish intervals_,\r\nalways produced a remarkable amelioration. Last year I was called to the\r\nhouse of an upholsterer. He preferred not going to bed at all to passing\r\nthe night in bed without closing his eyes. He had humid asthma with\r\nincessant cough, which ended by causing him to eject thick yellow and\r\npuriform mucus. For eight days he took _Arsenic_ and _Blatta_, and for a\r\nwhole week he passed the nights without sleeping. From the day he took\r\n_Bacillinum_ he was able to sleep. I saw him again this year in good\r\nhealth. Once or twice he was attacked with the same bronchorrhea, and\r\nhad my prescription made up at the chemists, with the same success. This\r\nyear, too, I have given _Bacillinum_ to several patients at the Hopital\r\nSt. Jacques for the same symptoms, and it has never yet failed me.\r\n\r\nWhen I am called upon to treat a patient suffering from an obstruction\r\nof the bronchial tubes occasioned by mucus, which is frequently thick\r\nand opaque and puriform--an obstruction extending to the delicate\r\nbronchial ramification, and causing oppression more frequently than\r\ncough, I turn my thoughts at once to _Bacillinum_. _Bacillinum_ is a\r\ndrug for old people, or, at any rate, for those whose lungs are old; for\r\nthose chronically catarrhal, or whose pulmonary circulation is enfeebled\r\nwithout regard to the age of the subject; for those who have dyspnoea,\r\nand who cough with difficulty from inaction of the respiratory ducts;\r\nfor the humid asthmatic, the bronchorrheal, who feel suffocated at\r\nnight; and, finally, for those who, after taking cold, are straightway\r\nattacked with pulmonary congestion. Here, I believe, is the exact\r\nsphere of action of _Bacillinum_ as a homoeopathic remedy.\r\n\r\n_Bacillinum_ has been stigmatized as an unstable product. I consider\r\nthis reproach ill-founded. _Bacillinum_ is no more unstable than\r\n_Psorinum_, which is an approved remedy in Homoeopathy. Typical\r\ntuberculous lungs contain practically almost invariable elements. Do not\r\nthe microbes produced by cultivation and the animal extracts show any\r\nvariation in quality, and do they not change in the long run?\r\n\r\nLike most homoeopathists who have made use of _Bacillinum_, I think it\r\nis best given in the high dilutions and at long intervals. Dr. J.\r\nCompton Burnett and Van der Berghe recommended the higher potencies--the\r\n1000th, 100,000, etc., whereas I content myself with the 30th, which\r\nsatisfies every requirement. As regards the intervals which must elapse\r\nbetween the doses, certain writers recommend from one to two weeks. In\r\nacute cases I generally give six globules of _Bacillinum_ 30th every two\r\nor three days; and in chronic cases of tuberculosis, etc., one dose\r\nabout twice a week.\r\n\r\nWe are no longer permitted to include in the same description the\r\ntuberculosis of birds and that of mammals. Although the two bacilli, as\r\nfar as form and color are concerned, are absolutely identical, the\r\nevolution of the two forms of tuberculosis presents characteristics so\r\ndifferent that we are forced to study them separately. At this day the\r\ndebate is a question of words, and experts discuss whether there are two\r\ndistinct genera or merely two different species.\r\n\r\nIt is this characteristic of non-transmissibility from mammals to birds,\r\nand _vice versa_, which forms the chief difference between the two kinds\r\nof tuberculosis. Strauss failed in his endeavor to inoculate a fowl with\r\ntuberculosis by injecting fifty kilogrammes of tuberculous human sputa,\r\nwhereas the fowl, absolutely impervious to human tuberculosis, became\r\ninfected when treated with a very slight quantity of the avian\r\ntuberculosis. The guinea-pig, so sensitive to the human microbe,\r\npresented encysted abscesses when treated with the virus of birds; it\r\ndies of cachexia, but never, as far as the naked eye can discern, of\r\ngeneralized tuberculosis. Rabbits are more sensitive to the avian\r\ninfection. Dogs are absolutely refractory. The monkey, so delicate in\r\nour climate, and which almost invariably perishes from tuberculosis, is\r\nuninjured by inoculation from avian virus. The parrot is a remarkable\r\nexception to the general rule; it is the only bird which resists avian\r\ntuberculosis, while, on the other hand, it is sensitive to that of man.\r\nSuch facts as these irrefutably differentiate the two kinds of\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [H]            _Tuberculosis of Birds._     _Tuberculosis of Mammals._\r\n\r\n  Aspect of        Extreme softness on        Human tuberculous\r\n  cultures.        glycerine jelly or         growths are adherent,\r\n                   on serum.                  hard and difficult to\r\n                                              break up even with a\r\n                                              strong platinum wire on\r\n                                              glycerine jelly as well\r\n                                              as on serum.\r\n\r\n  Medium of        Transferred from a         Cultivation more difficult.\r\n  cultures.        solid to a liquid\r\n                   medium the bacillus\r\n                   grows rapidly,\r\n                   having the appearance\r\n                   of rounded\r\n                   grains.\r\n\r\n  Temperature.

In our school the thing has been attempted at the Hopital\r\nSt. Jacques, where _Aviaire_ has been administered in homoeopathic\r\ndilutions, in potions or through punctures in cases of consumption. As a\r\nmatter of fact, neither allopaths nor homoeopaths have succeeded in\r\nobtaining a formula which will cure consumption with the virus of birds.\r\nAmelioration has been noted as with other remedies, but never a series\r\nof authenticated cures. Nevertheless, in every country experiments are\r\ncontinually being made; we must hope that they will end in a more\r\ndecisive success than is at present the case.\r\n\r\nHoping to profit by the homoeopathicity of an active virus, I was, I\r\nthink, one of the first who employed _Aviaire_ in non-tuberculous\r\nrespiratory affections on the lines of _Bacillinum_, and I am bound to\r\nsay that up to the present my faith in the law of similars has not been\r\nshaken by my experiments.\r\n\r\nIn _L'Art Medical_ (August, 1895) I published a number of cases in which\r\nI successfully treated localized bronchitis, generally the result of\r\ninfluenza, and reproducing the symptoms of tuberculosis, with _Aviaire_.\r\nThe most characteristic of all these observations is that of which I\r\nhave spoken above. The patient was restored to health as if by magic\r\nwith _Aviaire_ within three weeks. Dr. P. Jousset, anticipating my\r\nobservations, thus expressed himself in the number of _L'Art Medical_\r\npreceding the one which contained my remarks: \"A young woman entered the\r\nHopital St. Jacques at the end of January, 1895, with feverish\r\ninfluenzal bronchitis. At first the patient was treated with small doses\r\nof _Sulphate of Quinine_, and a little later she took _Ipecac_ and\r\n_Bryonia_ alternately. The fever disappeared and the general condition\r\nimproved considerably, and the sub-crepitant rales became confined to\r\nthe top of the left lung. The patient continued to expectorate thick\r\nnummular and puriform sputa, as in the influenza. After some days the\r\ndisease resumed its sway, the bodily forces diminished, the emaciation\r\nmade great progress, and local and general signs indicated rapid\r\nconsumption. Bacteriological analysis led to the detection of numerous\r\nKoch's bacilli. I gave over the case at this time, and some weeks\r\nafterwards I learnt with surprise that the patient was well and growing\r\nfat, and that the inoculation of the sputa had produced no effects. The\r\ncure has been maintained for three months, and the young woman has\r\nresumed her employment.\" I had prescribed _Aviaire_ 100th, five drops a\r\nday, during the whole period of the disease, unaccompanied by any other\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, more than a year afterwards the young woman\r\ncontinued in good health.\r\n\r\nFollowing this case, Dr. Jousset quoted two analogous instances in his\r\npractice, both of influential bronchitis, in which the sputa contained,\r\nfor a certain period, Koch's bacillus. One was cured with _Aviaire_ 6th\r\nand strong doses of _Sulphate of Quinine_, and the other with _Aviaire_\r\n6th and twenty drops of _Tincture of Drosera_, a day.\r\n\r\n\"What conclusions must I draw from these facts?\" says Dr. Jousset. \"That\r\nthe avian tuberculosis cured the consumption? I have failed too often in\r\nthe treatment of ordinary consumption with this remedy to admit that.\"\r\nThat is my opinion also.\r\n\r\nKoch's bacillus has been found in the nasal secretions of healthy\r\nhospital nurses, and of students of medicine, as noted by Strauss. Would\r\nit not be possible to come across it accidentally in certain kinds of\r\nexpectoration, just as the pneumococcus is found in saliva?\r\n\r\nIn one of the numbers of _La Medecine Moderne_ of last year there\r\nappeared a short article on the \"Influenzas known as pseudo-phymic.\" The\r\nwriter remarked on the strong analogy which certain complications of\r\npulmonary influenza presented to acute tuberculosis. He observed, among\r\nother forms: 1st, the influenzal bronchitis which affected one of the\r\nsummits of the lung, the most difficult form to diagnose from\r\ntuberculosis; 2d, the broncho-pneumonic form; 3d, the pleuro-pneumonic\r\nform, bearing a close resemblance to tuberculous pleurisy. I might\r\nremark that this last form is still little known and ill-defined. The\r\ninfluenza microbe always imitates to a remarkable degree the microbe of\r\ntuberculosis in certain instances; and if we wish to effect a cure on\r\nthe laws laid down by Hahnemann in certain forms of influenzal\r\nbronchitis, we must frequently seek for the simillimum in the virus of\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned oppression as one of the characteristics of\r\n_Bacillinum_. Now influenzal bronchitis is markedly accompanied by an\r\nincessant cough and by grave general symptoms. There is more frequently\r\nacute than passive, obstructive and dyspnoeic congestion. I am\r\ninclined to prefer _Aviaire_ to _Bacillinum_ in such cases, and I should\r\nlike to briefly touch upon certain cases in my practice.\r\n\r\nI have under my care a little girl of twelve years of age who has for\r\ntwo years developed an influenza which rapidly leads to pulmonary\r\nsymptoms, always distinctly localized in the top of the left lung. The\r\nmother is tuberculous, and the child, who was born with forceps, has her\r\nleft chest less developed than her right. The congestion which\r\naccompanies the influenza is sudden and severe; within twenty-four hours\r\nthe lung is invaded, and fine rales are soon heard. Twice running, at\r\nintervals of a year, _Aviaire_ 100th has stifled the symptoms in a few\r\ndays. I have seen an analogous case, only with congestion of the base of\r\nthe lung.\r\n\r\nIn my clinical report of the Hopital St. Jacques (in August, 1895) I\r\nnote ten cases of acute influenzal bronchitis with incessant cough,\r\nfever, and expectoration, rapidly cured with _Aviaire_. This year I have\r\nprescribed it with the same success as at the Hopital St. Jacques in\r\ncases of influenzal bronchitis, with active congestion. I will mention\r\ntwo cases of the pulmonary complications of measles which were rapidly\r\ndissipated by this remedy; but I must also mention a third case of\r\nmeasles in which _Aviaire_ failed and _Bryonia_ proved successful. The\r\nchild had an acute rubeolic laryngitis, and few pulmonary symptoms.\r\n_Bryonia_ was in this case more decidedly indicated than _Aviaire_.\r\n\r\nThe dilution of _Aviaire_ which I have always used is the 100th. I give\r\nusually five drops a day.\r\n\r\nIt seems that _Aviaire_ does not act in diminishing the cough like an\r\nanodyne or a narcotic, but braces up the whole organism. The relief of\r\ndebility and the return of appetite are the phenomena which I have\r\nobserved in conjunction with the diminution of the cough.\r\n\r\nI have given _Aviaire_ 100th for weeks, and even for a month, regularly\r\nevery day, without having observed excitement or aggravation. It would\r\nthus appear to be a remedy of long-lasting action, capable in certain\r\ncases of modifying the organism, and of bracing a constitution which has\r\nbecome enfeebled from the effects of influenza or of suspicious\r\nbronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with _Bacillinum_ I have noted, in my observations on\r\n_Aviaire_, considerable cough and little dyspnoea--an acute\r\ninflammatory, extremely irritating cough, such as one meets with in\r\nacute diseases or sub-acute affections in young people; a cough which\r\nfatigues, and which leads to enfeeblement and loss of appetite--in a\r\nword, a suspicious cough. To conclude my remarks, the utility of\r\n_Aviaire_ in _suspicious bronchitis_--an expression on which I again lay\r\nstress--I will recall certain indubitable examples of the cure (at the\r\nHopital St. Jacques) of bronchitis or of pulmonary congestion at the top\r\nof one of the lungs, or of bronchitis on one side only, or of congestion\r\npredominating on one side. These localizations on one side are\r\nsufficiently grave symptoms to warrant apprehension of the hatching of\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\nIf I were myself attacked, as the result of influenza or measles, or of\r\nsome weakening malady, with an incessant tickling and stubborn cough,\r\nwith certain closely localized pulmonary symptoms; if I lost my strength\r\nand appetite; if, in a word, I were attacked by bronchitis whose upshot\r\nwas highly doubtful, and which caused apprehension of tuberculosis, I\r\nshould not hesitate a single moment, with the examples which I have had\r\nbefore me, to try _Aviaire_ 100th upon myself.\r\n\r\nSuch is the conclusion of my clinical observations made at Hopital St.\r\nJacques in August, 1895.\r\n\r\nWhat I said last year I can only repeat with renewed confidence in this;\r\nand I hope that the years which follow will not cause me to alter my\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLIS PERENNIS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Compositae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, English Daisy. Garden Daisy. Hens and Chickens.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh plant, in flower, is pounded to a pulp and\r\nsubmitted to pressure. The expressed juice is then mixed with an equal\r\npart by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following is from Thomas' _Additions to the\r\n     Homoeopathic Materia Medica_, 1858. To it we may add\r\n     Dr. J. C. Burnett's statement that _Bellis_ is a remedy\r\n     for all ills that may be traced to a sudden wetting when\r\n     overheated.)\r\n\r\n_Bellis perennis_ or daisy, formerly called _consolida_, on account of\r\nits vulnerary properties; the roots and leaves were used in wound\r\ndrinks, and were considered efficacious in removing extravasated blood\r\nfrom bruises, etc. It is said to be refused by cattle on account of its\r\npeculiar taste. Lightfoot, in his _Flora Scotica_, says: \"In a scarcity\r\nof garden-stuff, they (daisies) have, in some countries, been\r\nsubstituted as pot herbs.\" My first trial with this plant as a curative\r\nagent was in the autumn of 1856. While on a visit in the neighborhood of\r\nBangor, a countryman, understanding that I was a \"doctor,\" wished me to\r\nprescribe for his foot, which he had sprained very badly. Not having\r\neither _Arnica_ or _Rhus_ with me, I determined to try the effects of\r\nthe daisy; so directed him to procure a handful of the leaves and\r\nflowers of the plant, chop them up small, boil them for a quarter of an\r\nhour in half a pint of water, and apply them in linen as a poultice\r\nround the ankle at night. The application was not made until the next\r\nmorning, but in half an hour's time the ankle admitted of very fair\r\nmotion. A piece of calico wetted and wrung out of the daisy water was\r\nthen wrapped round the ankle, and the man put his shoe on and limped\r\nabout all day, walking not less than five miles. He repeated the\r\npoultice at night, and found his ankle so much restored in the morning\r\nthat he was able to walk four miles to his work without experiencing any\r\ndifficulty. The success, in this instance, so far exceeded the previous\r\nuse of _Arnica_ and _Rhus_, especially in the time gained, that I had a\r\ntincture from the whole plant made for such uses, and have used it in\r\nsprained ankle from a fall--the ankle was well the second day. A sprain\r\nof the wrist, which had been a week ailing, yielded to the daisy in\r\nthree days. I have also successfully used it in several severe whitlows;\r\nin every case the pure tincture was used externally. The only provings I\r\nhave made with this remedy have been with the pure tincture in ten or\r\ntwenty drop doses at a time. After taking the medicine for fourteen days\r\nwithout any symptoms, I suspended the use of it--in two weeks after\r\nleaving it off, for the first time in my life I had a large boil on the\r\nback of my neck (right side), commencing with a dull aching pain; some\r\ndifficulty and a bruised pain in keeping the head erect; slight nausea,\r\nwant of appetite, and a little giddiness in the head at times. Pain in\r\nmiddle finger of the left hand, as of a gathering, for a short time\r\nonly; and at the same time pain in inner side of left forearm, as of a\r\nboil developing; two nights before similar pains in corresponding parts\r\nof the right arm--query, are these effects of _Bellis_ (this was written\r\nDecember 11, 1856). The boil on the neck came December 7, 1856; began as\r\na slight pimple with burning pain in the skin, increasing until in six\r\ndays' time it was very large, of a dark fiery purple color, and very\r\nsore burning and aching pain in it, accompanied with headache, extending\r\nfrom occiput to sinciput, of a cold aching character; brain as though\r\ncontracted in frontal region, dizziness, etc. (as before stated). I now\r\nset to work to cure myself, which by use of hot fomentations and lint\r\ndipped in [Greek: theta] tincture of _Belladonna_ externally, taking at\r\nthe same time 3d dil. _Belladonna_ internally, was soon accomplished.\r\nThree days after this was cured, another made its appearance, which\r\nspeedily succumbed to the same remedies. As I had never previously had a\r\nboil, and had not made any change in my diet, I suspected _Bellis_\r\ntincture to be the cause of the trouble. On the 12th of January, 1857,\r\nfeeling my left foot somewhat strained after running, I applied _Bellis_\r\n[Greek: theta] to the strain, which for several days aggravated the\r\nfeeling; and in five hours after the application I had another small\r\nboil (three weeks after disappearance of the last), which yielded to\r\nsame treatment as the others, by January 19, 1857. On March 7, 1857, I\r\nchewed some daisy flowers. On the 11th, a small boil appeared at the\r\nangle of the inferior maxilla, right side; _Belladonna_ [Greek: theta],\r\nexternally, cured it. The last trial I made with the third centesimal\r\ndilution of _Bellis_, taking three drops on Tuesday, 2d March, 1858, on\r\nthe following Friday a small pimple appeared a little behind the angle\r\nof _left_ inferior maxilla; it increased very much in size and pain by\r\nSaturday, when I treated it with _Belladonna_ [Greek: theta] externally,\r\nto which it soon yielded. As at no other time in my life have I suffered\r\nfrom boils, I am inclined to think these are due to the use of the\r\ndaisy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERBERIS AQUIFOLIUM.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Berberidaceae\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Oregon grape. Mountain grape.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh root and stem is pounded to a pulp and macerated\r\nin two parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (This unintentional proving was published in August,\r\n     1896, under the signature J. d. W. C. The paper referred\r\n     to by J. d. W. C. was a clipping from the _Eclectic\r\n     Medical Journal_.)\r\n\r\nIn the _Homoeopathic Recorder_ for March, 1896, p. 133, there appears\r\nan interesting article on the virtues of the plant named above--it\r\nstarts out with: \"From the fact that it will make a 'new' man of an old\r\none in a short time it is an excellent remedy.\"\r\n\r\nAs I am now over sixty years old, it seemed high time to cast about for\r\nsomething possessing the virtue specified, viz., making \"a 'new' man out\r\nof an old one\"--and to my knowledge, as I have never had five days'\r\nillness confining me to bed, or even to my room, during the said sixty\r\nyears, I considered myself an easy subject for the contemplated\r\nrejuvenation; besides all this, I am what some would call a\r\nhomoeopathic \"crank;\" and believed, and yet believe, if there be\r\nanything that can effect such a transformation it is to be found only\r\nwithin the lines of Homoeopathy, I immediately ordered quantum suf. of\r\nthe article in question from the celebrated firm of Boericke & Tafel,\r\nand started out on the trip to the \"Fountain of Youth\" in full\r\nconfidence that _something_ would come of it.\r\n\r\nThe first day I took two doses mother tincture 10-15 drops each; no\r\nspecial effect noticed--no youthfulness either! Second day, ditto; third\r\nday, one dose in morning; after bank hours went to friend's sanctum and\r\nengaged in a game of chess, and while so engaged felt a growing sense of\r\nnausea and thick-headedness--so much so, that I was obliged to excuse\r\nmyself and hurry to my own quarters. _Berberis_, however, did not once\r\noccur to me--I had scarce reached my room when the sense of nausea\r\n(seven minutes' lively walk, since it became really oppressive) had\r\n_full sway_, and having eaten nothing whatever since the previous\r\nevening (as I do not eat unless I am hungry) the straining was rather\r\nsevere, but exactly similar to some previous attacks of\r\n\"biliousness\"--in feeling, and color and taste of discharges--and still\r\n_Berberis_ did not occur to me; as soon as the strain was over I was\r\nseized with a remarkable and peculiar headache; a thing of which I have\r\nno recollection whatever to have previously experienced in any\r\nshape--the sensation was that of a strong, well-defined, compressive\r\nband of iron (or some unyielding substance), about two inches wide,\r\npassing _entirely round the head, just above the ears_--it kept on\r\ngrowing tighter and tighter; I jumped from the reclined position on a\r\ncouch, wet a folded towel in cold water, and passed it round my head so\r\nas to cover the \"band;\" but it gave little relief; about 10 o'clock I\r\nbegan to think over what I might have eaten to disagree with me so, and\r\nat last _Berberis_ came plump into sight; I at once prepared a cup of\r\nstrong, strong coffee (Hahnemann's antidote, and for which I had to send\r\nto a neighbor), believing it would antidote the _Berberis_ (or rather\r\nhoping it might), and about 12 o'clock there was a slight diminution of\r\npressure; then more coffee, black and strong, two or three mouthfuls,\r\nand again laid down; by morning the serious phase of the headache had\r\ndisappeared, but I was exceedingly tremulous in nerves and unsteady in\r\ngait up to noon, when I ventured on some oatmeal and syrup--habitually,\r\nI do not eat meat, or drink tea or coffee, nor spirituous liquors, nor\r\nuse tobacco, and have not for over thirty years.\r\n\r\nFinally, I \"made a good recovery,\" and now whenever I have a sensation\r\nof biliousness I touch my tongue to my finger after touching the cork of\r\nthe mother tincture bottle of _Berberis aqui._; with laid finger--and\r\nhave no trouble compared to what I have usually had--I believe I may\r\nsay, I am subject to bilousness by heredity, but it has removed much\r\nthereof, and this remedy, I think, is good enough for the remainder.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLATTA ORIENTALIS.\r\n\r\nSYNONYM, Indian cockroach.\r\n\r\nCLASS, Insecta.\r\n\r\nORDER, Orthoptera.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME (Indian), Talapoka.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Triturate in the usual way.\r\n\r\n     (These two papers are by Dr. D. N. Ray, of Calcutta,\r\n     India, and were originally published in the\r\n     _Homoeopathic Recorder_ in the years 1890 and 1891. A\r\n     number of papers from American physicians could be added\r\n     confirming what Dr. Ray says of the drug.)\r\n\r\nThe _Blatta orientalis_ is a common insect in India, where it is found\r\nabundantly in the dwelling houses. It has rather a flat body, from an\r\ninch to a couple of inches in length; deep brown color. It can fly a\r\nshort distance. The wings reach beyond the body and cover it completely;\r\nthe feet have several segments and are provided with prickles.\r\n\r\nPreparation.--The live animal is crushed and triturated as under class\r\nIX of American Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia, a tincture can be\r\nprepared as under class IV of the same Pharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\nThis new unknown remedy has a curious anecdote connected with it. I call\r\nit new because it has not been mentioned in any of our medical works,\r\nalthough the use of _Blatta Americana_ (American cockroach) as a remedy\r\nfor dropsy has been mentioned in journals. The Indian cockroach is used\r\nnot in cases of dropsy but in cases of _Asthma_, a most obstinate\r\ndisease to deal with. In asthma it acts almost specifically. Before I\r\nfurther proceed to give an account of this new, invaluable drug I shall\r\nnarrate here a short story how it came into use.\r\n\r\nSome years ago an elderly gentleman had long been suffering from asthma;\r\nfor over twenty years. He took all measures and tried different methods\r\nof both recognized and unrecognized medical treatments, but\r\nunfortunately all proved in vain. At last he gave up all treatment and\r\nwas getting fits daily. He was brought to such a deplorable condition\r\nthat he was left to suffer. He was in the habit of taking tea. One\r\nafternoon as usual he drank his cup of tea--afterwards he noticed that\r\nhis oppression in the chest was much less and that he was feeling\r\nunusually better, so much so that he felt himself a different being.\r\nThis led him and his friends to inquire into the cause of it. He\r\nimmediately inferred that the relief was due to the drinking of the\r\n_tea_, although he habitually drank the same tea but never before had\r\nexperienced any such changes. So this change he attributed to something\r\nin the tea. The servant who prepared the tea was sent for and\r\nquestioned. His reply was that he made the tea as usual and there was\r\nnothing new in it. The residue of the teacup was carefully examined,\r\nnothing was found there, but on examining the tea-pot a dead cockroach\r\nwas discovered. So it was concluded that this _infusion_ of cockroach\r\ndid the gentleman a world of good. The very day he drank that _cup of\r\ntea_ he had hardly any fit of asthma at night, and in a few days he got\r\nentirely well to his and his friends' surprise.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of his Providential recovery were communicated to some of\r\nhis friends--one of them, not a medical man, but quite an enterprising\r\ngentleman, took this into his head and resolved to try whether cockroach\r\ndoes any good to other asthmatic patients. For this purpose he got a lot\r\nof cockroaches, put them alive into a quantity of boiling water and\r\nmixed it after filtering the water when cool with almost the same\r\nquantity of the rectified spirit of wine, so that it might last for some\r\ntime without getting soured. This new mixture (or tincture) he began to\r\ntry in each and every case of asthma that he came across. The dose was a\r\ndrop each time, 3 or 4 doses daily, and more frequently during the fits\r\nof asthma. Within a short time he made some such wonderful cures that\r\npeople began to flock from different parts of the country to his door.\r\nSoon the number of attendants was so great that he had to manufacture\r\nthe medicine by pounds and all this medicine he distributed to patients\r\nwithout any charge. He has records of some of the cases.\r\n\r\nSome two years ago a patient of mine asked me whether we make any use of\r\n_Talapoka_ (cockroach) in our Pharmacopoeia. My reply was that we use\r\nmany loathsome insects as our remedial agents. I told him also that\r\n_Blatta Americana_ (American cockroach), I had heard, had been used in\r\ncases of dropsy, but I had no practical experience with it. He then said\r\nthe Indian cockroach is used in cases of asthma and he knew several\r\ncases had been cured with it. This struck me and I determined to try\r\nthis in cases of asthma whenever next opportunity occurred. For this\r\npurpose I got a lot of live cockroaches, killed them and pounded to a\r\nfine pulp and triturated according to class IX of American\r\nHomoeopathic Pharmacopoeia, that is, two parts by weight of the\r\nsubstance and nine parts by weight of sugar of milk, giving 1x\r\ntrituration. Thus I prepare up to 3x trituration and I also make an\r\nalcoholic solution--a few live cockroaches were crushed and five parts\r\nby weight of alcohol poured over them--it was allowed to remain eight\r\ndays in a dark, cool place, being shaken twice daily. After the\r\nexpiration of that period the alcoholic solution was poured off,\r\nstrained and filtered, when it was ready for use.\r\n\r\nI began to try both the preparations--drop doses of the tincture and\r\ngrain doses of 1x, 2x and sometimes 3x, 3 or 4 times daily when there\r\nwas no fit and almost every fifteen minutes or half hourly during the\r\nseverity of a fit. Both preparations began to answer well and I was\r\ngetting daily more and more encouraged about the efficacy of this new\r\ndrug. I had the opportunity of trying quite a number of cases of asthma\r\nwithin this short time, the reports of which I wish to publish in the\r\nfuture, but for the present I am glad to say in many cases it acted\r\nalmost specifically, that is, the whole trouble cleared away within a\r\nfortnight or so without recurrence. In some cases the severity of the\r\nparoxysm was lessened and the recurrence of the fits took place at a\r\nlonger interval; in others again only temporary benefit was observed.\r\nThis failure to benefit all cases alike I attribute to many\r\ncircumstances. Some people did not, rather could not, take the medicine\r\nregularly according to my directions owing to their untoward\r\ncircumstances; some persons were suffering from other complications\r\nalong with asthma; some again got temporary relief and in the meantime\r\ndiscontinued the medicine and came back again when there was a\r\nrecurrence of the fits, that is, they did not continue the drug for\r\nsufficient length of time. Some cases again, not having derived\r\nimmediate benefit, got impatient and discontinued the medicine without\r\nproper trial.\r\n\r\nBesides all these, I think individual idiosyncrasy has a great deal to\r\ndo. The season of the year has some influence. It is usually observed in\r\nthis country that those who are subject to periodical attacks of\r\nasthmatic fits are more prone to an attack either during the full or the\r\nnew moon, or at both the times. I believe if it is properly watched this\r\nfact will be evident all over the world. Same is true of some other\r\ndiseases, as chronic cough, chronic fevers, rheumatism, either acute or\r\nchronic, gout, elephantiasis, other glandular enlargements, etc., get\r\naggravated or are prone to aggravation during such changes of the moon.\r\nThen some people get more severe and frequent fits during the winter\r\nthan the summer and the others more during the summer than the winter.\r\nLet me here tell you that the Indian summer is very different from\r\neither the English or the American. Some part of the Indian summer\r\nseason is quite rainy and the atmosphere is saturated with moisture and\r\nother irritating ingredients, consequently a class of asthmatic people\r\nsuffer more during this season. I noticed to this class of cases _Blatta\r\norientalis_ will prove most efficacious. I have used it in bronchial and\r\nnervous asthma with better success than the stomachae.\r\n\r\nSECOND PAPER.\r\n\r\nI have of late tried _Blatta orientalis_ indiscriminately in almost all\r\ncases of asthma that have come under my treatment, and I am glad to say\r\nI have received good results in most cases, as the reports of some of\r\nthe clinical cases will show. I have not come to any definite use of\r\nthis drug yet, but I shall only mention a few facts that I have observed\r\nduring its use. It acts better in low potency and repeated doses during\r\nan attack of asthma; when the spasm subsides, the terminal asthmatic\r\ncough with wheezing and slight dyspnoea, etc., is better relieved with\r\nhigher potencies; the low potency, if continued after the spasmodic\r\nperiod is over, will make the cough more troublesome and harassing to\r\nthe patient and the expectoration tenacious, thick and very difficult to\r\nraise, but this will not be the case if the potency is changed. I had\r\nthis difficulty in a few cases when I was less acquainted with the\r\naction of the drug, but now I manage my cases better. In four patients\r\nwho continued the drug for some time in the low potency, during the\r\nparoxysm and after it was over, the cough became dry and hacking with\r\nlittle or no expectoration, the streaks of blood appeared in the sputa,\r\nwhich the patients had never observed in the course of their long\r\nillness. This appearance of blood in their sputa was the cause of a\r\ngreat anxiety to them and made them hurry over to my office. On inquiry\r\nI learned from two of them--one a lady and the other a young man--that\r\nwhile taking this remedy they felt a sensation all over the body, for\r\nfour or five days previous to the appearance of the blood, as if heat\r\nwere radiating from the ears, eyes, nose, top of the head, palms of the\r\nhands and soles of the feet. They attributed this sensation of heat all\r\nover the body and the appearance of the blood in the expectoration to\r\nthe drug. I directed them to stop the medicine at once; this they did,\r\nand with the discontinuance of it the blood disappeared from the sputa\r\nas well as the sensation of heat, but to me it was an open question\r\nwhether this appearance of blood in the expectoration was due to\r\noverdrugging, although I must say that the presence of the streaks of\r\nblood in the sputa of asthmatic patients is not an uncommon phenomenon.\r\nI resolved to give the same potency to the same patients after the\r\nlapse of some days. I did so, and to my surprise the blood-streaked\r\nsputa again appeared after they had taken the remedy ix, one grain four\r\ntimes daily. From this the patients understood it was the same medicine\r\nthat had been given to them on the last occasion and begged me not to\r\ngive it again, as the appearance of blood in the sputum frightened them,\r\nin spite of all my assurance. No more strong doses of the drug were\r\ngiven to them and they did not notice any more blood in the sputum. I\r\nhave heard other patients complain of this peculiar sensation of heat\r\nwhenever strong doses were given to them for some time. It acts better\r\non stout and corpulent than on thin and emaciated persons. The asthmatic\r\npatients subject to repeated attacks of malaria derive less permanent\r\nbenefit from the use of the drug. So, it seems to me, that in haemic\r\nasthma, which is due to the abnormal condition of the blood, it is\r\nefficacious. I have also used this drug in troublesome cough with\r\ndyspnoea of phthisical patients with good result.\r\n\r\nCLINICAL CASES.\r\n\r\nCASE I. Baln R. M., aged fifty-five, thin, emaciated and irritable\r\ntemperament, has been suffering from hereditary asthma for the last\r\ntwenty-five years. For the last six or seven years he suffered from\r\nasthmatic fits almost nightly and a troublesome cough with a good deal\r\nof frothy expectoration. He said he had not known what sleep was for the\r\nlast six or seven years, in fact, he could not lie down in bed, as that\r\nwould immediately bring on a violent fit of coughing which would not\r\ncease until he sat up, so the recumbent posture for him was almost\r\nimpracticable, and he used to sit up during the night and doze on a pile\r\nof pillows. He passed his days comparatively better, but the approach of\r\nthe night was a horror to him, his struggle, commencing at 9 or 10 P.M.,\r\nwould last till the morning. He was the father of many children and was\r\nwell taken care of, but his suffering was so great that he had no\r\nambition to live any longer. He tried almost all systems of medicine\r\nwithout much good. For the last ten years he took opium, which afforded\r\nhim slight relief at the beginning, using as high as forty-eight grains\r\nof opium in twenty-four hours. Owing to the constant sitting posture he\r\nbecame stooped, and the back of his neck stiff and painful. In April,\r\n1889, he was suddenly taken ill with fever. The fever became protracted.\r\nAfter an illness of over a month his condition became so bad that all\r\nhope of his recovery was given up. During this illness he was treated by\r\nan old school physician of some repute, but his condition daily grew\r\nworse, the asthmatic attacks became very violent and almost incessant,\r\nand the difficulty of breathing very great. He became so feeble that he\r\nhad not strength enough to enable him to bring up the expectoration; his\r\nchest was full of it; fever was less; there was general anasarca. He was\r\nsitting with head bent forward, almost touching the bed, as that was the\r\nonly position possible to him day and night. He had become almost\r\nspeechless, when I was sent for, at about 3 P.M. on the 23d of May,\r\n1889. When I was entering the patient's room a medical man came out and\r\nhinted that there was no use of my going in as the patient was just\r\nexpiring. I found the patient breathing hard; unconscious; jaws were\r\nlocked and saliva dribbling from the corners of his mouth; body cold;\r\ncold, clammy perspiration on forehead; eyes partially opened; in fact,\r\nto all appearance, he looked as if he were dead, except for the\r\nrespiratory movements. I felt his pulse and found it was not so bad as\r\nthe patient was looking. I examined the back of his chest, as that was\r\nthe only portion easily accessible, and noticed that the bronchial\r\nspasms were going on with loud mucous rale. From the character of his\r\npulse I thought that the present state of the patient was _probably_ due\r\nto the continued violent struggle and not deep coma, and that he had\r\nbecome so exhausted that he was motionless, speechless and completely\r\nunconscious. His bed was surrounded by many friends and relations, who\r\nhad come to bid him a last farewell; and it was with surprise that they\r\nall looked at me when I proposed to administer medicine to a patient\r\nwhose death was expected every minute and for whose cremation\r\npreparations were being made.\r\n\r\nI got a big phial full of water and put in it _Blatta orientalis_ 1x\r\ntrit. a few grains and tried two or three times to give him a spoonful\r\nof it, but in vain; the jaws were locked and I could not make him\r\nswallow any of that medicine; then I put some powder dry in the hollow\r\nof his lips and asked the attendants to try to give him the medicine I\r\nleft in the bottle. I was asked whether there was any hope of his\r\nrecovery, of course my answer was \"_no_,\" and I also said he could only\r\nlive a few hours. I left the patient's house with the idea of not\r\nvisiting it again, but at 9 P.M. a messenger came with the report that\r\nthe patient was slightly better, he could swallow medicine and two doses\r\nof it had been given. I was asked to see the patient again. I could\r\nhardly believe what he said, however, I went to see the patient again. I\r\nnoticed there was a slight change for the better, the pulse was steady,\r\nthe jaws were unlocked, there was mobility of the limbs, he could\r\nswallow liquid with ease and was expectorating freely, the breathing\r\nthough still difficult was slightly improved. There was the winking of\r\nthe eyelids. On the whole he was looking less lifeless, but still I\r\nentertained no hope of his recovery. I left instructions to repeat the\r\nsame medicine once or twice during the night, if required, at the same\r\ntime to give milk repeatedly, one or two spoonfuls at a time, and to\r\ninform me next morning if he had survived the night. Next morning I\r\nreally grew anxious to know what had become of my patient who had shown\r\nsymptoms slightly better with this new remedy. A messenger came with the\r\nreport that the patient passed a good night. I was requested to see him\r\nagain. When I arrived at his place at 8 A.M. I was surprised to see him\r\nso much better, he had not only regained his consciousness, but was\r\nsitting quietly in his bed, could speak slowly, the difficulty of\r\nbreathing was completely gone, but the cough occasionally troubled him\r\nand a good deal of expectoration of frothy white or sometimes of big\r\nyellowish lumps of mucus came up. He was given three doses of the same\r\nmedicine 2x trit. during the day. He passed a fair day, but at night his\r\ndifficulty of breathing again appeared in somewhat milder form. He had\r\nto take two doses of the medicine. Thus the medicine was continued for a\r\nweek and his trouble daily became less and less until after the\r\nexpiration of a week he was able to sleep at night for the first time in\r\nthe last six or seven years. I treated him over a month, and his health\r\nimproved so rapidly that he not only got rid of the asthmatic trouble,\r\nbut was soon able to go out and even attend his business. The stooped\r\ncondition of his neck with slight pain and slight chronic bronchitis did\r\nnot leave him altogether. Besides _Blatta orientalis_, I also prescribed\r\nfor him _Arsenicum alb. 6_ and _12_, _Naja tri. 6_, _Ipecac 3_, and\r\n_Antim. tart. 3_, as they were indicated. He continued well for over a\r\nyear, but in August, 1890, he had slight reappearance of the asthmatic\r\ntrouble. He again took _Blatta orientalis_ and got well.\r\n\r\nCASE II. Mrs. Nundy, a thin lady, aged twenty-three, mother of three\r\nchildren, came from a village for the treatment of asthma, from which\r\nshe had been suffering for the last eight years. For the first two or\r\nthree years she used to get two or three attacks in the year, but\r\ngradually they were repeated more frequently, though the character of\r\nthe attack remained the same throughout. It would last two days and two\r\nnights, whether any medicine was given to her or not. Nothing would\r\nalleviate her suffering during an attack--too much interference would\r\nincrease her sufferings and prolong the duration of the attack, so,\r\npractically speaking, almost nothing was given to her during an attack.\r\nThe great oppression of breathing, restlessness, profuse perspiration,\r\ninability to move or lie down and loud wheezing would be the most\r\nprominent symptoms in each attack. These would remain almost with equal\r\nviolence for nearly forty hours, when the spasms would cease with slight\r\ncough and expectoration, and she would be perfectly at ease as ever,\r\nand there would be no trace of disease left, except slight wheezing\r\nsound on auscultation. But latterly these attacks were very frequent,\r\nalmost every week or ten days. In August, 1890, she was brought here for\r\ntreatment. It is worth while to mention that she took both allopathic\r\nand native drugs during the interval of attacks to prevent their\r\nrecurrence, but without any effect. I saw her first on the morning of\r\nthe 5th of August, during an attack. I prescribed _Blatta Orientalis_ IX\r\ntrit., one grain every two hours. It was to their surprise that this\r\nattack subsided unlike all others by the evening; that is, it\r\ndisappeared within twenty hours. This encouraged the lady and her\r\nhusband so much that she wanted to have regular course of treatment\r\nunder me. I put her under tincture of _Blatta Orientalis_ IX, one drop\r\nper dose, twice daily. She continued this medicine till the time of the\r\nnext attack was over; that is, for ten days. After the expiration of\r\nthis period she began to complain of a sensation of heat all over her\r\nbody, so I changed it to 3x, one drop morning and evening. She kept\r\nwell, and after a month she went home thinking she got well. A month\r\nafter her going home she had an attack of asthma at night and took\r\n_Blatta Orientalis_ IX as before, and by the next morning she was well.\r\nThis was in October, and after two months of the last attack. She had\r\nanother attack in winter and none since.\r\n\r\nCASE III. A young man, aged thirty-four, had been suffering from asthma\r\nfor some years. He was invariably worse during the rains and the winter,\r\nand a chronic bronchitis was almost a constant accompaniment. He tried\r\nallopathic and lots of patent drugs, with only temporary amelioration of\r\nthe trouble. At last, in November, 1888, he came to my office. On\r\nexamination of his chest I found there was a chronic bronchitis. He said\r\nthat slight difficulty of breathing with hacking cough used to trouble\r\nhim every night, besides a cold would be followed by a severe attack of\r\nasthma, so its periodicity of recurrence was irregular. I treated him\r\nwith _Ipecac_, _Arsenicum alb._, etc. The first-named medicine did him\r\nthe most good, but he never got entirely well. So in July, 1889, I put\r\nhim under tincture _Blatta orientalis_ 3X, drop doses, three or four\r\ntimes daily. Under its use he began to improve steadily, and had only\r\ntwo or three attacks of asthmatic fits since he used this drug, which\r\nwere promptly relieved by the same drug in 1x potency. _Euphrasia off._\r\nwas prescribed for his cold whenever he had it. He is free from all\r\ntrouble for the last year and a half. His general condition is so much\r\nchanged that there is no apprehension of the recurrence of his former\r\nillness.\r\n\r\nCASE IV. Baln Bose, an old, corpulent gentleman, aged sixty-two, has\r\nbeen suffering from asthmatic attacks for some years. He never took any\r\nallopathic medicine, but had always been under treatment of native\r\nkabiraj (medical men), under whose treatment he was sometimes better and\r\nworse at others. Latterly he became very bad and passed several\r\nsleepless nights. He used to pass his days comparatively better, and it\r\nwas at night and in the morning he used to be worse. On the 24th of\r\nJuly, 1890, at 9 A.M. I saw him first--there was a slight touch of\r\nasthma even then. I made him try to lie down in bed; this he could not\r\ndo, owing to the coughing fit it excited while in that posture. On\r\nexamination the chest revealed chronic bronchial catarrh, and there was\r\nalso a harassing cough, with very little expectoration after repeated\r\nexertion. I prescribed _Blatta orientalis_ IX trit., one grain every two\r\nhours. He passed the night without an attack, and the next morning when\r\nI saw him he complained that only the cough was troublesome last night\r\nand no fit of asthma. The cough was somewhat troublesome even when I saw\r\nhim in the morning. I gave him tincture _Blatta ori._ 3x, one drop dose\r\nevery two hours. He passed the day and night well. He continued the\r\ntreatment for a fortnight and then went home, where he has been keeping\r\ngood health, with the exception of an occasional bronchial catarrh.\r\n\r\nCASE V. A shoemaker, aged forty-two, robust constitution, has been\r\nsuffering with asthma for three or four years. He came to my office on\r\nthe 6th of November, 1890. He had been getting asthmatic fits almost\r\nevery night since October last. During the day troublesome cough, with\r\nslight expectoration and hurried breathing made him unable to attend his\r\nbusiness. Tincture _Blatta orientalis_ IX, one drop doses, six times\r\ndaily, was given. The very first day he perceived the good effect of the\r\nmedicine and continued the same for a month, when he got well and\r\ndiscontinued the medicine. He has been keeping well ever since.\r\n\r\nCASE VI. Mr. G., aged forty, healthy constitution, had an asthmatic fit\r\non the 4th of August, 1890, preceded by a violent attack of cold, from\r\nwhich he frequently used to suffer. He had this severe cold in the\r\nmorning, and in the afternoon he began to experience a great difficulty\r\nof breathing and slight oppression and lightness of the chest--this, by\r\n9 P.M., developed into a regular fit of asthma. I was sent for. On my\r\narrival, at 10 P.M., I found he was sitting before a pile of pillows\r\nwith elbows supported on them, and struggling for breath. There was also\r\na great tightness in the chest, occasional cough, and inability to\r\nspeak. I at once put him under _Blatta orientalis_ IX trit., one grain\r\nevery fifteen minutes, and less frequently afterwards if he felt better.\r\nOn my visit next morning I found him much better, but he said his\r\ntrouble at night continued, more or less, till 2 A.M., after which he\r\ngot some rest. Now, there was a troublesome cough, slight oppression of\r\nthe chest and great apprehension of a second attack in the night. The\r\nsame medicine, 3x trit., was given to him during the day, and a few\r\npowders of 1x were left with him in case he was to get an attack at\r\nnight. There was a slight aggravation of those symptoms at night, and he\r\nhad occasion to take only two powders of 1x. The next morning he was\r\nevery way better, except the cough, for which four powders of 3x were\r\ngiven daily. In four or five days he got entirely well and had no\r\nrelapse.\r\n\r\nCASE VII. Mrs. D., aged twenty, a healthy, stout lady, mother of one\r\nchild, had been always enjoying good health, was suddenly attacked with\r\na violent fit of asthma on the 8th of August, 1890. This was the first\r\noccasion she had a fit of asthma, the result of a severe cold. At about\r\n2 A.M. she was suddenly seized with difficulty of breathing and a great\r\noppression in the chest. She could not lie down any longer in bed and\r\nhad to sit up, being supported on a pile of pillows. In the morning at 8\r\nA.M. I saw her first. I noticed she was in great agony and almost\r\nspeechless. On examination I could not detect much loud wheezing--the\r\ncharacteristic of an asthmatic attack--though the rapid movements of the\r\nwalls of the chest were even quite visible to the bystanders. The\r\npatient was feeling almost choked up, and could not express what was\r\ngoing on. She only pointed out a point, a little over the pit of the\r\nstomach most painful. There was no cough--perspiration was pouring over\r\nher body. I could not at once make out whether it was a case of pure\r\nasthma, especially as she never had it before. However, I made up my\r\nmind to give her _Blatta orientalis_ IX trit., a grain dose every\r\nfifteen minutes, and watch the effect myself. Three doses of it were\r\ngiven without much change for the better. I left a few more doses to be\r\nrepeated half hourly and promised to see her again within a couple of\r\nhours. On my return I found her in a much better condition, and she had\r\ntaken only one of those powders I had left, and they were not repeated,\r\nas she felt better. Now I thought it must have been an attack of asthma,\r\nand I continued the medicine unhesitatingly. There was no aggravation at\r\nnight, but on the next morning she was better, and the usual asthmatic\r\ncough began with slight expectoration. There was pain in the chest and\r\nhead with each coughing fit. _Blatta orientalis_ 3x trit., four to six\r\ndoses, was continued for a few days, when she got well. Again in\r\nNovember she had a slight tendency to an asthmatic fit, took two or\r\nthree doses of the same medicine and got well. Since then she had not\r\nbeen troubled again.\r\n\r\nCASE VIII. A gentleman, the keeper of a common shop, aged forty-four,\r\nbelonging to a village, had been suffering from asthma for the last\r\neight years and had always been under treatment of native kabiraj\r\n(medical men). In June, he came to the city, and I was called to see him\r\non the 14th of June, to treat him for his asthma. The day previous he\r\nhad an attack, for which he took no medicine. Each of his attacks\r\nusually lasted four or five days. I gave him _Blatta orientalis_ IX\r\ntrit., one grain every two hours, and left him six such powders to be\r\ntaken during the day. He took them and felt better the next day. He\r\nstayed here two or three days more, and when well he wanted to proceed\r\nhome, which was some couple of hundred miles. He took with him two\r\ntwo-drachm phials of _Blatta orientalis_, one of IX and the other of 3x\r\ntrit. He continued the 3x, one grain doses, two or three times daily,\r\nfor a month, and discontinued afterward. He had no more asthmatic fits.\r\nIn January last, 1891, I had a letter from him, thanking me for his\r\nrecovery and asking for some of the same medicine for a friend of his,\r\nwho had been suffering from asthma. The friend of his who used the same\r\ndrug, _Blatta orientalis_, was equally benefited.\r\n\r\nCASE IX. Mrs. Dalta, a thin lady, aged thirty-eight, mother of several\r\nchildren, had been exposed to cold, which brought on an attack of\r\nbronchitis with fever. This, in the course of a fortnight, developed\r\ninto a regular fit of asthma. She was all this time treated by an\r\nold-school physician, but when the husband of the lady saw that she was\r\ndaily getting worse, and a new disease crept in, he made up his mind to\r\nchange the treatment. I was called to see her in the morning of the 8th\r\nof June, 1890. She became very much emaciated, could not take any food,\r\nhad fever with acute bronchitis, hurried respiration, difficulty of\r\nbreathing; this she was complaining of bitterly, owing to which she\r\ncould not lie down in bed, but had to sit up day and night. There was a\r\nprolonged fit of spasmodic cough at short intervals, with slight\r\nexpectoration, but these coughing fits would make her almost breathless.\r\nThis was the first time I prescribed _Blatta orientalis_ IX in a case\r\nof asthma with fever and acute bronchitis. It answered my purpose well.\r\nShe had only ten powders during the day and passed a comparatively\r\nbetter night. Next morning when I saw her she was better, except the\r\ncoughing fits, which were continuing as before. The same medicine was\r\nrepeated. On the 10th of June she had no asthmatic trouble at night, but\r\nthere was not much improvement in her cough--_Anti. tart._ and _Bryonia_\r\nwere needed to complete the cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOLETUS LARICIS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Fungi.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Larch Agaric, Larch Boletus, Purging Agaric, White Agaric.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The dried fungus is macerated in five parts by weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Here are two typical cases out of thirteen by Dr. W. H.\r\n     Burt, which we find in the _North American Journal of\r\n     Homoeopathy_, 1866, quoted from the _Medical Investigator_\r\n     from a volume not attainable.)\r\n\r\nCASE 1. Intermittent fever: Type Quotidiana Duplex. In a large lymphatic\r\nwoman; weight about 180 lbs.; aged thirty-nine. November 4th. For the\r\nlast five weeks has had the ague. At first it was a simple quotidian.\r\nTook Quinine, which broke it for four days, when it returned; took\r\nQuinine in massive doses, which checked it for one week. It returned two\r\nweeks since, in the form of a double quotidian. The chill comes on every\r\nday at 10 A.M. and 5 P.M.\r\n\r\nThe chill lasts from one to two hours each time; hands and feet get icy\r\ncold, chills run up and down the spine, with severe pains in the head,\r\nback and limbs; followed by high fever for three hours, and then profuse\r\nsweat. Tongue furred whitish-yellow, with large fissures in the tongue;\r\nflat, bitter taste; has had no appetite for five weeks; craves cold\r\nwater all the time; bowels rather costive; has nausea during every\r\nchill, but no vomiting; very weak, can only sit up about one hour in the\r\nmorning; great depression of spirits, cries during the whole\r\nexamination; face very much jaundiced. Treatment: _Ars. 2_, every two\r\nhours, for three days. It produced constant nausea and lessened the\r\nchills, but aggravated the fever. I then determined to try the _Boletus_\r\n1st, two grs. every two hours. Took two doses when the chills came on,\r\nshe then ceased to take the medicine until 5 P.M. Took three doses, and\r\nthen fell asleep. 8th. Says she is feeling a little better, continued\r\ntreatment; 10 A.M., commenced to have a severe diarrhoea, an effect of\r\nthe medicine; discontinued the powders until 5 P.M. The fever did not\r\ncome on until 3 P.M.; had no chill; fever lasted three hours; perspired\r\nprofusely all night; slept well for the first time in a number of weeks.\r\n9th. Feeling much better. Fever came on at 4 P.M., had no chill; fever\r\nlasted four hours; nausea all the evening; sweat all night. 10th.\r\nFeeling quite well. Had no more fever, but had night sweats for a week\r\nafter. Convalescence was very slow; notwithstanding she had no more\r\nfever it was three weeks before she felt perfectly well.\r\n\r\nThis case demonstrates the fact to us that the _Boletus_ is superior to\r\nour _greatest remedial_ agents in the case of intermittents. I believe\r\nif I had not been acquainted with the therapeutic properties of the\r\n_Boletus_ I would have been compelled to treat this lady every few weeks\r\nfor two or three months with our usual remedies.\r\n\r\nCASE 2. Intermittent fever: Type quotidian. November 1st, Mrs. B., aged\r\nfifty-six. Temperament, nervous. Three weeks since had an abscess in\r\nleft ear, which made her quite sick for a week. Since then has had a\r\nfever every afternoon and night; feels chilly whenever she moves;\r\nwalking produces nausea; does not perspire any; tongue coated white;\r\nloss of appetite; bowels loose; very restless at night, cannot sleep\r\nany; getting very weak, keeps her bed most of the time. Gave _Boletus\r\nlaricis_. Had the fever but one day after.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCAREA RENALIS PRAEPARATA.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--There are two kinds of renal calculi, the phosphatic and\r\nthe uric, which should be triturated as separate preparations.\r\n\r\n     (The _Homoeopathric Examiner_, 1846, contained the\r\n     following paper, by Dr. Bredenoll. We may add that the\r\n     remedy is reported to be peculiarly beneficial in Rigg's\r\n     disease of the teeth.)\r\n\r\nMy professional engagements do not permit me to spend much time in\r\nwriting; the following case, however, I deem worthy of note.\r\n\r\nBorn of healthy parents, I remained quite healthy until my twenty-third\r\nyear. I had no trouble in getting over the diseases to which children\r\nare generally liable. Some of them, scarlet fever and measles, attacked\r\nme when I was already engaged in my professional career. I am now\r\nfifty-seven years old.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1808, while vaccinating children, I caught the itch from one\r\nof them. Although I washed myself with soap water immediately, yet a\r\npustule made its appearance in about eight days, between the little\r\nfinger and ring finger of the left hand; afterwards a few more came on\r\nat the same place and some others between the ring and middle finger. I\r\nhastened to repel this eruption as fast as possible, which I\r\nunfortunately succeeded in doing within the period of eight days.\r\n\r\nThis suppression of the eruption was followed by a host of diseases:\r\nLiability to catching cold; frequent catarrh; rheumatic complaints;\r\ntoothache; attacks of hemicrania, with vomiting; continual heartburn;\r\nhaemorrhoidal complaints, at times tumors, at times fluent; excessive\r\nemaciation; afterwards a pustulous eruption over the whole body; painful\r\nswelling of the joints, arthritic nodosities in different places; a\r\ncopper-colored eruption in the face, especially on and about the nose,\r\nwhich made me look like a confirmed drunkard, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThese affections tormented me more or less, until in the year 1833 I\r\nvisited Hahnemann at Coethen, for the purpose of studying homoeopathia\r\nwith him. Hahnemann treated me for three weeks, and I continued the\r\ntreatment at my native place. My health improved steadily, and at the\r\nend of a year I considered myself cured. This lasted until October,\r\n1836, when I was attacked with violent colic in one night. The pain was\r\nfelt in the region of the left kidney, lancinating, pinching, sore;\r\nretching ensued, resulting in vomiting of mucus, and lastly bile. I took\r\na few pellets of _Nux v._ x; after this the pain disappeared gradually,\r\nand the vomiting ceased. Next day I was well again. Two days afterwards\r\nI discovered gravel in the urine, and my sufferings had vanished.\r\n\r\nOne year elapsed in this way; however, I occasionally experienced an\r\nuncomfortable sensation in the region of the left kidney, especially\r\nwhen riding on horseback, driving in a carriage, or walking fast; I took\r\nat times _Lycopod._, at times _Nux v._, in proportion as one or the\r\nother of these two remedies appeared indicated.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1837, I was suddenly attacked with vomiting, accompanied\r\nwith violent lancinating, sore or pinching pains in the region of the\r\nleft kidney. The horrible anguish and pain which I experienced extorted\r\nfrom me involuntary screams; I was writhing like a worm in the dust. A\r\ncalculus had descended into the ureter and had become incarcerated in\r\nit. Repeated doses of _Nux_ relieved the incarceration, and I distinctly\r\nfelt that the calculus was descending towards the bladder. After\r\ntwenty-four hours of horrible suffering the vomiting ceased, the pain\r\nbecame duller and was felt in the region where the ureter dips into and\r\nbecomes interwoven with the tissue of the bladder: it continued for\r\nthree days and then disappeared all of a sudden (the stone had not got\r\ninto the bladder). Thirty-six hours afterwards the calculus entered the\r\nbulb of the urethra. I felt a frequent desire to urinate; the urine was\r\nturbid and bloody, until at last a calculus of four grains made its\r\nappearance in the urine. After this I frequently passed gravel and\r\ncalculi, at times with slight, at times violent pains, sometimes\r\naccompanied with vomiting; I kept the larger calculi, with a view of\r\nusing them hereafter as a curative agent.\r\n\r\nProfessor Nasse, of Bonn, where my son studied medicine at the time, has\r\nanalyzed the calculi, and has found them to be urate of lime. He advised\r\nme to take _Merc. dulcis_ and the _Sulphate of Soda_ for some time; it\r\nis scarcely necessary for me to say that I did not follow his advice.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of February, 1839, I felt the precursory symptoms of a\r\nnew attack, which really did break out in all its fury on the 16th, and\r\ncontinued on the 17th and 18th. I now caused 5 grains of my calculi to\r\nbe triturated in my presence with 95 grains of sugar of milk, according\r\nto the fashion of Hahnemann, and took 1/2 grain in the evening of the\r\n17th, another 1/2 grain in the morning of the 18th. On this day I passed\r\nvery turbid urine with a considerable quantity of gravel; however, in\r\nthe region where the ureter dips into the bladder, I experienced an\r\nuncomfortable sensation, but was well otherwise. On the 19th I was\r\nobliged to visit a patient at the distance of two miles; on my journey I\r\nfelt that the calculus was descending into the bladder; the urine which\r\nI emitted shortly afterwards was very turbid and bloody. That same\r\nevening, after returning home, I felt the stone in the bulb of the\r\nurethra, and on the morning of the 20th it came off during stool, but\r\nunfortunately got lost among the excrement. To judge from my feeling it\r\nmust have been larger than any of the preceding calculi, and also\r\nrougher, for its passage through the urethra was very painful and\r\nfollowed by an oozing out of blood.\r\n\r\nThe uncomfortable feeling in the region of the left kidney never\r\ndisappeared completely; it became especially painful when pressing upon\r\nthat place, when riding on horseback or in a carriage, when taking\r\nexercise or turning the body. It seems to me that the whole pelvis of\r\nthe kidneys must have been full of gravel and calculi. I now took 1/2\r\ngrain at intervals of eight days; the result was that I passed gravel\r\nand small calculi at every micturition. On the 30th of November my\r\ncondition got worse, and I continued to take 1/2 grain of _Calc. ren.\r\npraep._, at longer or shorter intervals, until October 18th, 1840. After\r\nthis period I ceased to pass any gravel, and I felt entirely well. On\r\nthe 3d of February I passed some more gravel. Another dose of 1/2 grain\r\nof _Lapis renalis_; another dose on June 3d. On June 17th precursors of\r\nanother attack; on the 18th vomiting accompanied by all the frightful\r\ncircumstances which I have detailed above; the vomiting of mucus, bile,\r\ningesta, continued at short intervals until the 26th; my tongue was\r\ncoated with yellow mucus, and my appetite had completely disappeared.\r\n_Bryon., Nux v._ and _Pulsat._ relieved the gastric symptom; on the\r\n26th, in the afternoon, I passed a calculus of the size of a pea. I now\r\nresume the use of _Calc. ren. praep._ in 1/2 grain doses, at irregular\r\nintervals. On the 23d of October I passed a calculus of the size of a\r\npea, without vomiting; there were no other precursory symptoms except\r\nthe uncomfortable feeling in the region of the kidney a few days\r\nprevious. I have felt well ever since and free from all complaint,\r\nalthough I continue the occasional use of 1/2 a grain of _Calc. ren.\r\npraep._, lest I should have a relapse.\r\n\r\nEvery time I took a dose of _Calc. ren. pr._ I found that the so-called\r\ntartar on the teeth became detached a few days afterwards. A short while\r\nago a nodosity, hard as a stone, which had appeared on the extensor\r\ntendon of the right middle finger, about nine months ago, and which\r\nthreatened to increase more and more, disappeared. I consider the tartar\r\non the teeth, calculi renales and arthritic nodosities very similar\r\nmorbid products.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I beg leave to offer the following remarks:\r\n\r\n1. Hahnemann's theory of psora is no chimera, as many theoreticians\r\nwould have us believe. I was perfectly healthy previous to my being\r\ninfected with itch. What a host of sufferings have I been obliged to\r\nendure after the suppression of the itch!\r\n\r\n2. Isopathy deserves especial notice.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the most suitable homoeopathic remedies afforded me\r\nrelief; the incarceration of calculi in the ureter especially was\r\nrelieved by _Nux_; but they were unable to put a stop to the formation\r\nof calculi; this result was only attained by the preparation of _Calc.\r\nren._\r\n\r\n\r\nCEANOTHUS AMERICANUS.\r\n\r\nNAT.

I am indebted to my friend, Dr. Burnett, for the suggestion\r\nof using _Ceanothus_.\r\n\r\nA thin and haggard looking young man presented himself to my office on\r\nthe 26th of July, 1896. He told me he had some disease of the heart and\r\nhad been under the treatment of several eminent allopathic physicians of\r\nthis city; some declared it to be a case of hypertrophy of the heart and\r\nsome of valvular disease.\r\n\r\nWithout asking him further, I examined his heart thoroughly, but with no\r\nparticular results. The rhythm and sounds were all normal only there was\r\na degree of weakness in these sounds. Dulness on percussion was not\r\nextended beyond its usual limit. So I could not make out any heart\r\ndisease in this man.\r\n\r\nOn further inquiry, I learned that the man remained in a most malarious\r\nplace for five years, during which he had been suffering off and on\r\nfrom intermittent fever. I percussed the abdomen and found an enormously\r\nenlarged and indurated spleen, reaching beyond the navel and pushing up\r\nthe thoracic viscera.\r\n\r\nThe patient complained of palpitation of heart, dyspnoea, especially\r\non ascending steps and walking fast. I thought from these symptoms his\r\nformer medical advisers concluded heart disease. In my mind they seemed\r\nto be resulted from enlarged spleen.\r\n\r\nOn that very day I gave him six powders of _Ceonothus Amer._ 3x, one\r\ndose morning and evening. I asked him to see me when his medicine\r\nfinished. He did not make his appearance, however, on the appointed day.\r\nI thought the result of my prescription was not promising. After a week\r\nhe came and reported unusually good results.\r\n\r\nHis dyspnoea was gone, palpitation troubled him now and then, but much\r\nless than before. He wanted me to give him the same powders. I gave him\r\n_Sac. lac._, six doses, in the usual way.\r\n\r\nReported further improvement; the same powders of _Sac. lac._ twice. To\r\nmy astonishment I found the spleen much reduced in size and softened\r\nthan before; I knew nothing about this patient for some time. Only\r\nrecently I saw him, a perfect picture of sound health. He informed me\r\nthat the same powders were sufficient to set him right. He gained\r\nhealth; no sign of enlarged spleen left.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEPHALANTHUS OCCIDENTALIS.\r\n\r\nNAT.

(seventh day, Sunday).\r\n\r\nRecurrence of old dreams of years ago.\r\n\r\nYawning (second day).\r\n\r\n_Generalities._--Feeling miserably on retiring.\r\n\r\nThrows himself on bed without undressing.\r\n\r\nGreat yawning fit (third day).\r\n\r\nFeels not pleasant.\r\n\r\nFeels half sick.\r\n\r\nVery dull in the morning, all morning.\r\n\r\nFeels very badly, has an ill-defined bad feeling in the evening and at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nEasily chilled in a room; better on disrobing for bed.\r\n\r\nAlternations of symptoms of mind and bodily pains. When pains of the\r\nbody are noticed, symptoms affecting the mind are suspended. The mind\r\nloses its characteristics, is clear, and one feels better.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.--In looking over the above proving we find a number of\r\nillustrations of the alternate action of the drug. But perhaps what\r\nstrikes the reader most forcibly is the way the symptoms follow Reuter's\r\nseries. The most prominent symptoms early developed, catarrhal and\r\ngastric, have come and gone within three or four days, while those\r\naffecting the chest, heart, sensorium, eyes, brain, and nerves are more\r\nslowly developed, and are the ones that persist. Another thing to be\r\nnoticed is the long duration of its action. The high-water mark in\r\nregard to its action was not reached (I mean its action on the nervous\r\nsystem) until nearly ten days after discontinuing to take it. It is an\r\n_antipsoric_ of remarkable power. Some skin symptoms developed by it\r\npersisted off and on for years, two or three of which I will mention.\r\n\"Itching of the right popliteal space,\" this after continuing for eight\r\nor nine years disappeared. I think some _Sepia_ [Greek: Ip] I took had\r\nsomething to do with its disappearance. Another: \"Itching with roughness\r\nof the skin, like eczema, above the left knee anteriorly.\" This still\r\npersists. I still have \"Itching, with an eruption resembling at times\r\nherpes zoster below the left scapula.\" This is still present, although\r\nannoying. I have done nothing to cause its disappearance.\r\n\r\nIn regard to _verifications_ I could report a goodly number. One of the\r\nfirst I ever had was a case of eczema of both hands, extending as far as\r\nthe elbows. Cured in six weeks. The provings point in the direction of\r\nkidney troubles, and I have seen it speedily cause the disappearance of\r\ndeposits in the urine that were giving much inconvenience. In a case of\r\ndropsy of cardiac and renal origin (albuminuria) in which there was\r\ngreat oedema, cured in two or three weeks. Sleeplessness, peculiar in\r\nits nature, corresponding to the proving, is relieved by it. Intercostal\r\nneuralgia, especially on left side. Anterior crural neuralgia, an\r\naggravated case, promptly relieved. I need not say that the symptoms\r\nstrongly point to rheumatism. I could say much on that part of the\r\nsubject, and there is the sphere in which it has seemed to have been\r\nuseful by the professional friend to whom I have furnished the medicine\r\nfor trial. In a monograph by Dr. R. E. Kunge, of New York, and the\r\nwriter, I ventured the prediction that _Cereus bonplandii_ would prove\r\nof value in the treatment of insanity. I send you the report of two\r\ncases. I have one other still under treatment. A patient for fourteen\r\nyears in the Middletown Insane Hospital, improving, called to see Ida\r\nReamer, a young woman of eighteen, living in New Scotland, on what is\r\ncalled the Heldeberg Mountain or hill, on the evening of April 19th,\r\n1884. For some time previously she had been living with a relative in\r\nAlbany, attending school and assisting in household labor. Had studied\r\nhard and probably overtaxed her strength. Her friends noticing that she\r\nwas not her former self, and that though usually amiable and cheerful,\r\nshe had become gloomy and taciturn, brought her home. Rest did her no\r\ngood, and I was called after she had been home for some time. On my\r\nvisit I noticed she would not answer questions; was wandering aimlessly\r\nabout the house; could not sit still, if seated, more than a few\r\nminutes. During my visit I think she changed her position a dozen or\r\nfifteen times. She would go to the water pail and get a drink, then in a\r\nminute or two would get up and go to the door. After standing a minute\r\nor two she would come in and sit down, only to rise up and repeat her\r\nrestless wanderings. I could elicit nothing from the mother of anything\r\nwrong in regard to the menstrual function. Prescribed _Cereus\r\nbonplandii_, fourth decimal. Did not call again, but was informed by her\r\nfriend that she soon regained her health. Was requested to call again to\r\nsee Ida R. on November 29th of the same year. This time there was\r\nconsiderable mental disturbance; she had attended some entertainment\r\nwhich she had considered of a questionable nature, and had been worrying\r\nover it. Although living out at service, it did not appear that she had\r\noverworked. I found her sitting still; she would sit for hours. If any\r\none disturbed her, she would curse, swear, throw boots and shoes or\r\nanything that came in her way, resisted attempts made by her friends to\r\nremove her to her home. Prescribed _Cer. bon._ 4. Saw her December 3d,\r\n7th, 10th, at the end of which time she was entirely free from any\r\nmental manifestations, and although under observation has never\r\nexperienced a return of them to the present date.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1879 was consulted in the case of Mrs. D. V., afflicted\r\nwith melancholia for a year or two. The disease had appeared just\r\nsubsequent to her confinement with her last child. Prescribed wholesome\r\nadvice in regard to mode of life, etc., and very little medicine. In a\r\nfew months she was apparently as well as ever. June 5th, 1884, was\r\ncalled to see Mrs. D. V. She had quite recently given birth to a child\r\nand was developing delusions, most of which were those of a spiritual\r\nnature. She thought she had committed the unpardonable sin, or that she\r\nhad offended some of her friends, and was constantly worrying. Appetite\r\nvery poor. Prescribed _Cer. bon._ 4, gave her nourishing diet with\r\nMaltine and Pepsin to aid digestion. On July 11th she was about the\r\nhouse attending to her household duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEIRANTHUS CHEIRI.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Cruciferae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Wall flower.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh plant is pounded to a pulp and macerated in two\r\nparts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Robert T. Cooper, of London, contributed the\r\n     following to the _Hahnemannian Monthly_, 1897):\r\n\r\nA tincture is used made from a single dark-flowered plant. No proving of\r\nthis remedy has come under my notice, yet I consider the following case\r\nworth reporting: T. T., age twenty, a clerk; admission date, 30th April,\r\n1892; never heard well on the left side, but particularly deaf the last\r\nmonth, and deafness increases; watch, hearing contact only. History of\r\nmuch earache in childhood; left ear discharges, but the discharge does\r\nnot run out. Wisdom teeth; left upper and right, lower and upper,\r\nbreaking through. Gave _Cheiranthus cheiri_.\r\n\r\n28th May, hears very much better; left, 3-1/2 inches. No medicine.\r\n\r\n11th June, continues improving gradually; left, 15 inches.\r\n\r\n25th June, continues to hear voices very fairly on the left side, but no\r\nimprovement since last time; left, 15 inches. Gave _Cheiranthus cheiri_.\r\n\r\n25th July, restoration of improving condition; left, 20 inches. No\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIONANTHUS VIRGINICA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Oleaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Fringe Tree. Snow-flower.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh bark is pounded to a pulp and macerated in two\r\nparts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following is the only proving, we believe, ever made\r\n     of this drug; it was the thesis of Dr. John W. Lawshe,\r\n     Atlanta, Ga., on his graduation, and was published in\r\n     _North American Journal of Homoeopathy_, May, 1883).\r\n\r\nThis being the first and only proving of this drug, Prof. Lilienthal\r\nrequested a copy of it for publication, which I cheerfully agreed to\r\ngive him.\r\n\r\nMonday, July 10, 1882, 9:30 A.M., I took one drop of the tincture,\r\nafter having taken the 12x and 6x potencies, one day each, without any\r\neffect. I continued taking the tincture each hour during the day,\r\nincreasing each dose one drop till five were reached, then increased\r\neach dose five drops till twenty-five were reached, but without any\r\neffect whatever.\r\n\r\nTuesday, July 11th, I began with thirty drops at 9 o'clock A.M., and\r\nincreased the dose five drops each hour till I reached one drachm, and\r\ntook three doses of one drachm each. I retired at 10 o'clock feeling\r\nperfectly well.\r\n\r\nI awoke at 4:10 A.M., Wednesday, July 12th, with a severe\r\nheadache--chiefly in the forehead and just over the eyes--especially the\r\nleft eye. Eyeballs exceedingly painful, feel sore and bruised.\r\n\r\nCutting twisting pains all through my abdomen.\r\n\r\nI turned over and lay with my face downward, which seemed to relieve the\r\nabdominal pains some, and after awhile I went to sleep. I awoke again at\r\n8:20 feeling very sick and badly all over. Head feels very sore all over\r\nand through it; heavy dull feeling in forehead and a drawing or pressing\r\nat the root of my nose. I felt so weak I had to sit down awhile before I\r\ncould finish dressing; _never_ before felt so sick at my stomach. Bitter\r\neructations, great nausea and retching, with a desire for stool.\r\n\r\nI finished dressing and looked at my tongue, which was heavily coated\r\nand of a dirty, greenish yellow color. I started down stairs and had a\r\nviolent attack of nausea and a great deal of retching before I could\r\nvomit. It seemed as though there were a \"_double suction_\" in my\r\nabdomen, one trying to force something up and the other sucking it back,\r\ntill finally, by quite an effort, I vomited a teacup full, or more, of\r\n_very dark green_ bile, rather ropy, _I think_, and exceedingly bitter.\r\nThe bile came up with a single gush and I was through. Immediately a\r\ncold perspiration broke out and stood in beads on my forehead, and I\r\nfelt very weak. Desire for stool gone after vomiting.\r\n\r\nI have a sore, weak, bruised feeling all over the small of my back;\r\nfeels very weak when standing or moving about; better sitting or lying\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nNo appetite for breakfast, but my stomach felt so weak and empty that I\r\ndrank a cup of coffee and ate half a biscuit, which relieved to some\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n9 A.M., am so nervous I cannot keep still and can hardly write down my\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n9:30 o'clock, my back in lumbar and sacral region is so sore and weak I\r\ncould hardly walk from the car to the office, every step seemed to jar\r\nmy whole body and made my headache worse.\r\n\r\n10 o'clock, have been quiet for half an hour and feel some better; have\r\na pressing or squeezing sensation in the bridge of my nose; sore\r\nconstricted feeling in the temples, with throbbing temporal arteries.\r\n\r\n10:30 o'clock, just came from stool; the first passed was watery, but\r\nthe last was more solid in appearance; stool terribly offensive, like\r\n_carrion_. Heavy, all-gone sort of feeling low down in hypogastrium;\r\ncolor of stool was dark brown with pieces of undigested food in it.\r\n\r\n11:30, just got home and feel very bad and weak. My head and back ache\r\nconsiderably, and I feel \"played out\" generally.\r\n\r\n12 o'clock, forehead and cheeks _very_ hot and dry, radial pulse 114,\r\nchilly sensation darting through body from front to back, causing a sort\r\nof shivering or involuntary jerking, forehead feels like a hot coal of\r\nfire to my hand; headache in forehead and over eyes relieved by pressing\r\nwith my hand, but I cannot bear it long for my head seems to get hotter\r\nfrom it; am exceedingly nervous, cannot lie still, involuntary jerkings\r\nin different parts of the body. Roof of mouth and tongue feel very dry,\r\nalthough there seems to be the usual amount of saliva present. No thirst\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nI went to sleep about 12:20 P.M., and was awakened at 2 o'clock for\r\ndinner. Couldn't eat anything; I tried but it nauseated me; could only\r\ndrink a cup of coffee; headache worse after waking; pulse 88; head not\r\nquite so hot, body feels chilly, and I had a shawl thrown over me; went\r\nto sleep again about 3:30.\r\n\r\nI was told that at 4:15 my face and head were covered with a profuse\r\nperspiration, and my carotid arteries pulsated very hard and rapidly; I\r\ngot up at 5 o'clock and bathed my face in cold water and felt somewhat\r\nbetter, though my head and back still ache considerably and feel quite\r\nsore; eyeballs feel bruised.\r\n\r\n6:30. Weak, empty feeling about stomach, which was relieved for awhile\r\nby eating some crackers and drinking a cup of coffee. Pulse still 88.\r\n\r\nAt 8:15 had an action from my bowels; during stool griping and cutting\r\npains in abdomen, about and below umbilicus; stool thin, watery,\r\nblackish-brown color and very offensive. I retired at 9:30 and had to\r\nhave an extra covering thrown upon me, I was so chilly, while my\r\nroom-mate lay without any covering at all. My head feels sore and\r\nbruised all over, and the small of my back is exceedingly weak and\r\nfeels, when I touch it with my hand, as though the skin were all off.\r\n\r\nThursday, July 13th. I was very nervous and restless last night after\r\ngoing to bed; didn't go to sleep till after 12 o'clock, and woke up\r\nseveral times before daylight with pains in my head, abdomen and back.\r\nGot up at 8 o'clock. My head feels sore and bruised; the bruised feeling\r\nseems to go into my brain now; every time I move, cough or laugh it\r\nseems as if my head would split open and fly in every direction; my\r\n_back_ is not so painful this morning; I couldn't eat much breakfast;\r\nstool this morning was quite copious, watery, _dark_ brown and not so\r\noffensive as yesterday.\r\n\r\n9:30. Headache better; several times this morning I have had attacks of\r\ncutting or griping pains in my intestines, in and about the umbilical\r\nregion; my tongue is very heavily coated in the centre with a thick\r\nyellowish fur; the tip is slightly red, and on each side of the tip\r\nthere are several little places that look as though blood was about to\r\nooze forth from them; my tongue feels drawn and shriveled up the centre.\r\n\r\n4:30. The only symptom at 11 o'clock was a dull, sore, aching feeling in\r\nthe umbilical and iliac regions, occasionally changing for just a minute\r\nor so to a severe griping, which was relieved some by emission of\r\nflatus. My face has a yellowish appearance; from the outer to the inner\r\ncanthus there is a reddish-yellow streak, about one-quarter of an inch\r\nwide, in the whites of both eyes; the blood vessels of the sclerotic\r\ncoat are very much enlarged and distinctly visible.\r\n\r\nFriday, July 14th. I suffered considerably after 5 o'clock yesterday\r\nafternoon and last night with pains in my abdomen, and they are more\r\nsevere this morning than yesterday; it feels just like a string tied in\r\na \"slip knot\" around my intestines in the umbilical region, and every\r\nonce in awhile it was _suddenly_ drawn tight for a minute or so, and\r\nthen _gradually_ loosened; stool this morning was very thin, watery and\r\nrather flaky; the flaky portion was dark yellow, the fluid portion\r\n_dark_ green, with a _light_ green foam or froth on top, streaked with a\r\nwhite, mucus-looking substance; flatus and faeces passed together; some\r\npain in my bowels during stool, and a hot, scalded sensation in anus,\r\nwhich lasted fifteen or twenty minutes after stool; during stool a cold\r\nperspiration broke out on my forehead and back of my hands; took quite a\r\nwhile to pass stool, and then only a small quantity passed; eyeballs\r\nfeel bruised and the whites have a yellowish cast all over, though the\r\n\"bands\" are still very distinct; my skin is quite yellow to-day and I\r\nfeel very much fatigued generally.\r\n\r\nSaturday, July 15th. Stool about natural this morning; some feeling in\r\nmy abdomen, though not so severe; no new symptoms.\r\n\r\nSunday, July 16th. The only thing unusual which I noticed to-day was the\r\npassage of considerable offensive flatus; a greater quantity after\r\nretiring than during the day.\r\n\r\nI noticed no more symptoms after Sunday night.\r\n\r\n     (The following is from a letter of Dr. E. M. Hale):\r\n\r\nSome time ago I received a letter from Dr. F. S. Smith, of Lock Haven,\r\nPa., in which, referring to _Chionanthus_, he says:\r\n\r\n\"For the first time to-day I read your article on _Chionanthus_ in the\r\nlast edition of your Materia Medica of 'New Remedies.' I have been using\r\nthis drug for over two years, as a specific for so-called sick headache.\r\nIt has done wonders for me in that disease. I had been a victim from\r\nearly childhood, and have suffered terribly. I have not had an attack\r\nfor two years. If I am threatened, a few drops, timely taken, dissipates\r\nit at once.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. B., a dentist, aged 35, dark complexion, a victim to sick headache,\r\nhad an attack on an average once in three weeks. Since taking\r\n_Chionanthus_, has not had more than two or three attacks in over two\r\nyears, and then owing to a neglect to take the medicine. I have failed\r\nin but one case, and that was a menstrual sick headache.\r\n\r\n\"I prescribe it as follows: In cases of habitual sick headache, 5 gtts.\r\nof the 2x dil. three times a day for a week, then twice a day for a\r\nweek, then once a day for a week, after which the patient only takes it\r\nwhen symptoms of the attack show themselves. I regard it almost a\r\nspecific.\"\r\n\r\n     (_Chionanthus_ is also, by some physicians, regarded as a\r\n     specific in jaundice, either acute or chronic, and the\r\n     proving seems to justify the belief.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNUS ALTERNIFOLIA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Cornaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Alternate-leaved Cornel or Dogwood. Swamp-walnut.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh bark and young twigs are pounded to a pulp and\r\nmacerated in two parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following proving of this remedy was made under the\r\n     supervision of Dr. F. H. Lutze, Brooklyn. The _Cornus\r\n     alternifolia_, or \"swamp walnut,\" has a reputation among\r\n     the people in certain localities as being a \"sure\" remedy\r\n     for \"salt rheum.\")\r\n\r\nFIRST PROVING BY R. E. ALBERTSON.\r\n\r\nCommence at bedtime Tuesday, May 12, 1896.\r\n\r\nWednesday, May 13, 1896.--Awoke this morning after a very refreshing\r\nnight's sleep, feeling as well as usual; and did not notice anything out\r\nof the ordinary during the entire day. Had stool, but somewhat scanty.\r\nAppetite fair.\r\n\r\nThursday, May 14, 1896.--Did not rest very well during night. Had dream\r\nI was spending summer in country. Did not get into anything like a sound\r\nsleep until near morning; and then was very reluctant about getting up;\r\nwould have preferred to have had a couple hours more of such sleep. I\r\nhave noticed nothing in the course of the day worthy of mention\r\nexcepting a pain across the small of the back, which lasted only a short\r\ntime and then disappeared. Stool to-day little better than yesterday.\r\n\r\nFriday, May 15, 1896.--Another restless night; would get into a light\r\nsleep off and on until near morning. Dreamed again; this time of an\r\nexciting fire drill. Up to to-day had been taking _Cornus alternifolia_\r\nthrice daily; 3 drops 30th, commencing with this morning every three\r\nhours. Stool to-day at first hard and difficult, then loose. Nothing\r\nfurther noticed to-day.\r\n\r\nSaturday, May 16, 1896.--Passed a very restless and sleepless night;\r\nguess I was awake at the striking of every hour. Tongue has been coated\r\na yellowish white for a couple of days. Stool to-day, but scanty. Feel\r\nas well as usual, but don't seem to have the ambition to do anything for\r\nany length of time.\r\n\r\nSunday, May 17, 1896.--Experienced another very restless and sleepless\r\nnight. Felt an aching in left shoulder and dull pain across forehead,\r\nmore particularly on right side. Stool to-day and appetite fair.\r\n\r\nMonday, May 18, 1896.--While I passed another restless night, it was not\r\nas bad as nights previous. Seem to hear every little noise and sound.\r\nWhen once awake, mind becomes active and then it is difficult to get\r\ninto a sleep again. Have dreamed something mostly every night; some of\r\nwhich I do not remember.\r\n\r\nTuesday, May 19, 1896.--Rested somewhat better last night; though was\r\nawake off and on. Last dose taken at bedtime.\r\n\r\nWednesday, May 20, 1896.--Experienced another restless night; was awake\r\nmost of the night until about 3 A.M., when I dropped off into a sleep.\r\n\r\nFriday, May 22, 1896.--Noticed a little sore inside of mouth (left\r\nside), which by Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday had become very\r\nannoying. When eating anything that came in contact with it, or even\r\nwhen moving the mouth in a certain direction would cause a sticking,\r\npricking pain. I also want to mention a few eruptions, small pustules on\r\nface and neck, which appeared during this proving.\r\n\r\nSECOND PROVING OF \"CORNUS ALTERNIFOLIA.\"\r\n\r\nBY F. H. LUTZE, M. D.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1, 1896.--Took 5 drops of [Greek: theta] three times daily.\r\n\r\nFebruary 6, 1896.--Took 5 drops of [Greek: theta] every two hours. On\r\nsecond day had two loose evacuations in quick succession in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nFebruary 9, 1896.--A cold feeling in chest as if it were filled with\r\ncold air or ice; this continued for two days and was very disagreeable,\r\nbut seemed to have no influence on action of heart or respiration.\r\n\r\nA second proving, commenced on April 1st, reproduced the same symptoms\r\nin same manner. Have made no proving of 30th yet.\r\n\r\nTHIRD PROVING OF \"CORNUS ALTERNIFOLIA\" 30TH DILUTION.\r\n\r\nCommenced at bedtime Sunday, June 7, 1896.\r\n\r\nMonday, June 8, 1896.--Awoke after being awake the greater part of the\r\nnight feeling as usual. Felt dull pain in right side region of liver\r\nabout 11 A.M.\r\n\r\nTuesday, June 9, 1896.--Slept very little; tossed and turned mostly all\r\nnight; could not get into any comfortable position. Tongue this morning\r\ncoated a yellowish white. No stool to-day and appetite fair.\r\n\r\nWednesday, June 10, 1896.--While I rested somewhat better than nights\r\nprevious, yet was awake considerable part of the night. Had two dreams;\r\none of dead rats mashed to a pulp; the other of coition, causing an\r\nemission. When I awoke this morning, felt a raw feeling in throat, which\r\ncontinued throughout the day; though not quite as bad as when I arose.\r\nSneezed some, too, to-day; head partially stopped up toward night. About\r\nan hour or two after dinner, which I ate with a relish, a sick sensation\r\ncame over me, a dull heavy feeling in forehead accompanied with a\r\nnauseous and dizzy feeling; could hardly pull one foot after the other\r\non my way home from work; but after being a little while in the open air\r\nand walking, feeling subsided some, and when I reached home felt much\r\nbetter; and after supper had entirely left me; though when I retired\r\nthat night I felt as though I had been doing a very hard day's work and\r\nwas glad when my body touched the bed. Stool very scanty to-day; appears\r\ndifficult to do anything; seems to be quite some gas.\r\n\r\nThursday, June 11, 1896.--Awoke very tired; sleep disturbed\r\nconsiderably; could not rest in any position. Raw feeling in throat\r\nstill this morning, with a frequent desire to clear; a feeling as though\r\nsomething lodged there and should come out. Stool to-day, but scant. A\r\ndull ache in region of heart felt in afternoon. Feel tired and drowsy.\r\nAll ambition seems to have left me. Appetite very good to-day.\r\n\r\nFriday, June 12, 1896.--Feel very well this morning and slept fairly\r\nwell during the night, though was awake a few times. To-day marks the\r\nfirst appearance of eruptions; one on the right wrist, the other on\r\nright side of chin; small pustules; in one case blind, all others\r\nforming pus.\r\n\r\nSaturday, June 13, 1896.--Experienced another restless night. Another\r\npustule has appeared on chin and also ringworm on forehead (right side);\r\nfeel very well to-day.\r\n\r\nSunday, June 14, 1896.--Slept fairly well during night. Experienced\r\nnothing particular excepting toward night an awful uneasy feeling came\r\nover me; a feeling that something terrible was going to happen.\r\n\r\nMonday, June 16, 1896.--Awoke very tired this morning; have a cough,\r\nwith a feeling as though something heavy was lying upon my chest and\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nWednesday, June 17, 1896.--Slept pretty well during night; feel very\r\nlanguid and tired; a feeling as though my legs were unable to bear me\r\nup.\r\n\r\nSunday, June 28, 1896.--Toward evening felt very tired and drowsy with\r\nheavy sensation in head; about 9:30 lay down upon the lounge and dropped\r\noff into a doze; awoke a half hour afterwards with a feeling as though I\r\nwanted to vomit, and chills, which continued for an hour when I vomited,\r\nwhich seemed to relieve me some, after which fever took the place of the\r\nchill which abated some toward morning.\r\n\r\nMonday, June 29, 1896.--Managed to get to my business, but was unable to\r\ndo anything all day on account of the weak feeling and a violent\r\npressing headache in forehead, which continued all day; worse on motion\r\nand on stooping felt as though everything would come out. About 5 P.M.\r\ndiarrhoea set in which continued all night, every half hour to an\r\nhour, the same the day following and continued right up to Sunday night,\r\nJuly 5th. Lost in that time six pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRATAEGUS OXYACANTHA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Pomaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, White or May Thorn. English Hawthorn.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh berries are pounded to a pulp and macerated in\r\ntwo times their weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The _The New York Medical Journal_, October 10, 1896,\r\n     published a communication from Dr. M. C. Jennings, under\r\n     the heading \"Crataegus Oxyacantha in the treatment of\r\n     Heart Disease,\" of which the following is the substance):\r\n\r\nDr. Green, of Ennis, Ireland, for many years had a reputation for the\r\ncure of heart disease that caused patients to flock to him from all\r\nparts of the United Kingdom. He cured the most of them and amassed\r\nconsiderable wealth by means of his secret, for, contrary to the code,\r\nhe, though a physician in good standing, refused to reveal the remedy to\r\nhis professional brethren. After his death, about two years ago, his\r\ndaughter, a Mrs. Graham, revealed the name of the remedy her father had\r\nused so successfully. It is _Crataegus oxyacantha_. So much for the\r\nhistory of the remedy. Dr. Jennings procured for himself some of the\r\nremedy, and his experience with it explains Dr. Green's national\r\nreputation. He writes:\r\n\r\n\"Case I was that of a Mr. B., aged seventy-three years. I found him\r\ngasping for breath when I entered the room, with a pulse-rate of 158 and\r\nvery feeble; great oedema of lower limbs and abdomen. A more desperate\r\ncase could hardly be found. I gave him fifteen drops of _Crataegus_ in\r\nhalf a wineglass of water. In fifteen minutes the pulse beat was 126 and\r\nstronger, and breathing was not so labored. In twenty-five minutes pulse\r\nbeat 110 and the force was still increasing, breathing much easier. He\r\nnow got ten drops in same quantity of water, and in one hour from the\r\ntime I entered the house he was, for the first time in ten days, able to\r\nlie horizontally on the bed. I made an examination of the heart and\r\nfound mitral regurgitation from valvular deficiency, with great\r\nenlargement. For the oedema I prescribed _Hydrargyrum cum creta_,\r\n_Squill_ and _Digitalis_. He received ten drops four times a day of the\r\n_Crataegus_ and was permitted to use some light beer, to which he had\r\nbecome accustomed at meal time. He made a rapid and apparently full\r\nrecovery until, in three months, he felt as well as any man of his age\r\nin Chicago. He occasionally, particularly in the change of weather,\r\ntakes some of the _Crataegus_ which, he says, quickly stops shortness of\r\nbreath or pain in the heart. His father and a brother died of heart\r\ndisease.\"\r\n\r\nAnother case was that of a young woman, who, when Dr. Jennings appeared\r\nin response to the summons, was said to be dead. \"I went in and found\r\nthat she was not quite dead, though apparently so. I put five or six\r\ndrops of _Nitrite of amyl_ to her nose, and alternately pressing and\r\nrelaxing the chest, so as to imitate natural breathing, I soon had her\r\nable to open her eyes and speak. I gave her hypodermically ten drops,\r\nand in less than half an hour she was able to talk and describe her\r\nfeelings. An examination revealed a painfully anaemic condition of the\r\npatient, but without any discoverable lesions of the heart, except\r\nfunctional.\" Under _Crataegus_ she made a good recovery. \"Her heart\r\ntrouble, though very dangerous, was only functional, and resulted from\r\nwant of proper assimilation of the food, due chiefly to the dyspeptic\r\nstate and dysentery.\"\r\n\r\nAnother case was that of a woman who \"was suffering from compensatory\r\nenlargement of the heart from mitral insufficiency,\" was taken with\r\ndyspnoea when Dr. Jennings was called and was nearly dead. Under\r\n_Crataegus_ and some other indicated remedies she made an excellent\r\nrecovery. \"In a letter from her, three months afterward, she said she\r\nwas feeling well, but that she would not feel fully secure without some\r\nof the _Crataegus_.\"\r\n\r\n\"The forty other cases ran courses somewhat similar to the three\r\ncited--all having been apparently cured. Yet I am not satisfied beyond a\r\ndoubt, that any of those patients were completely cured except those\r\nwhose trouble of the heart were functional, like the second case cited.\r\nAnd it is possible and even probable that in weather of a heavy\r\natmosphere or when it is surcharged with electricity, or if the patient\r\nbe subjected to great excitement or sudden or violent commotion or\r\nexercise he may suffer again therewith. That the medicine has a\r\nremarkable influence on the diseased heart must, I think, be admitted.\r\nFrom experiments on dogs and cats made by myself, it appears to\r\ninfluence the vagi and cardio inhibitory centres, and diminishes the\r\npulse rate, increases the intraventricular pressure, and thus filling\r\nthe heart with blood causes retardation of the beat and an equilibrium\r\nbetween the general blood pressure and force of the beat. Cardiac\r\nimpulse, after a few days' use of the _Crataegus_, is greatly\r\nstrengthened and yields that low, soft tone so characteristic of the\r\nfirst sound, as shown by the cardiograph. The entire central nervous\r\nsystem seems to be influenced favorably by its use; the appetite\r\nincreases and assimilation and nutrition improve, showing an influence\r\nover the sympathetic and the solar plexus. Also a sense of quietude and\r\nwell-being rests on the patient, and he who before its use was cross,\r\nmelancholic and irritable, after a few days of its use shows marked\r\nsigns of improvement in his mental state. I doubt if it is indicated in\r\nfatty enlargement. The dose which I have found to be the most available\r\nis from ten to fifteen drops after meals or food. If taken before food\r\nit may, in very susceptible patients, cause nausea. I find also that\r\nafter its use for a month it may be well to discontinue for a week or\r\ntwo, when it should be renewed for another month or so. Usually three\r\nmonths seem to be the proper time for actual treatment, and after that\r\nonly at such times as a warning pain of the heart or dyspnoea may\r\npoint out.\r\n\r\n     (The _Kansas City Medical Journal_, 1898, contained a\r\n     paper on the remedy, by Dr. Joseph Clements, from which\r\n     the following pertinent extracts are taken):\r\n\r\n\"About twelve years ago I was suddenly seized with terrible pain in the\r\nleft breast; it extended over the entire region of the heart and down\r\nthe brachial plexus of the left arm as far as the wrist. I pressed my\r\nhands over my heart and seemed unable to move. My lips blenched, my eyes\r\nrolled in a paroxysm of agony; the most fearful sense of impending\r\ncalamity oppressed me and I seemed to expect death, or something worse,\r\nto fall upon and overwhelm me. The attack lasted a short time and then\r\nbegan to subside, and soon I was myself again, but feeling weak and\r\nexcited. I consulted no one; took no medicine. I did not know what to\r\nmake of it, but gradually it faded from my mind and I thought no more of\r\nit until two years afterwards, when I had another attack, and again\r\nnearly a year later. Each of these was very severe, like the first, and\r\nlasted about as long and left me in about the same condition. I remember\r\nno other seizure of importance until about three years ago, and again a\r\nyear later. These were not so terrible in the suffering involved, but\r\nthe fear, the apprehension, the awful sense of coming calamity, I think,\r\ngrew upon me. From this time on, two years ago, the attacks came\r\nfrequently, the time varying from two or three months to two or three\r\nweeks between.\r\n\r\n\"I took some nitro-glycerine tablets and some pills of _Cactus Mexicana_,\r\nbut with no benefit that I could perceive. This brings me down to about\r\nfifteen months ago. I was feeling very badly, having had several attacks\r\nwithin a few weeks. My pulse was at times very rapid and weak, and\r\nirregular and intermittent.\r\n\r\n     (About this time he got hold of _Crataegus_ with the\r\n     following result):\r\n\r\n\"After getting my supply I began with six drops, increasing to ten before\r\nmeals and at bedtime. The results were marvellous. In twenty-four hours\r\nmy pulse showed marked improvement; in two or three weeks it became\r\nregular and smooth and forceful. Palpitation and dyspnoea soon\r\nentirely left me; I began to walk up and down hills without difficulty,\r\nand a more general and buoyant sense of security and well-being has come\r\nto stay. During the three months that I was taking the medicine, which I\r\ndid with a week's intermission several times, I had several slight\r\nattacks, one rather hard seizure, but was relieved at once on taking ten\r\ndrops of the medicine.\r\n\r\n     (He adds that hypodermic of _Morphia_ does not give\r\n     relief from these heart pains as quickly and as surely as\r\n     does fifteen drops of _Crataegus_. He also says, \"of\r\n     course I consider it the most useful discovery of the\r\n     Nineteenth century.\" He also names a number of \"the most\r\n     reputable and careful men in the profession,\" who are\r\n     having good results with this remedy.)\r\n\r\n     (Dr. T. C. Duncan contributes the following illustrative\r\n     cases):\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. A., a printer, came to me complaining of some pain in the side as\r\nif it would take her life. She did not have it all the time, only at\r\ntimes, usually the last of the week, when tired. I prescribed _Bryonia_,\r\nthen _Belladonna_, without prompt relief. One Saturday she came with a\r\nsevere attack, locating the pain with her right hand above and to the\r\nleft of the stomach. The pulse was strong and forcible. On careful\r\nexamination I found the heart beat below the normal, indicating\r\nhypertrophy. I examined the spine, and to the left of the vertebra about\r\ntwo inches I found a very tender spot (spinal hyperaemia). She told me\r\nthat when a girl she had several attacks, and that her own family\r\nphysician (Dr. Patchen) gave her a remedy that relieved her at once. She\r\nhad tried several physicians, among them an allopath, who gave\r\nhypodermic injections of morphia, without relief. Hot applications\r\nsometimes relieved.\r\n\r\n\"I now recognized that I had a case of angina pectoris, and that her\r\nearly attacks were due, I thought, to carrying her heavy brother. Now\r\nthe attacks come when she becomes tired holding her composing stick; at\r\nthe same time she became very much flurried, so much so that she had to\r\nstop work because she was so confused.\r\n\r\n\"I now gave her a prescription for _Cactus_, but told her I would like to\r\ntry first a new remedy, giving her _Crataegus_, saturating some disks\r\nwith the tincture (B. & T.). I directed her to take two disks every hour\r\nuntil relieved, and then less often. If not relieved to take the\r\n_Cactus_.\r\n\r\n\"She returned in a week reporting that she was relieved after the first\r\ndose of _Crataegus_. More, that hurried, flurried feeling had not\r\ntroubled her this week. Her face has a parchment skin, and the\r\nexpression of anxiety so significant of heart disease was certainly\r\nrelieved. I have not seen her since.\r\n\r\n\"In my proving of this drug it produced a flurried feeling due, I\r\nthought, to the rapid action of the stimulated heart. One prover, a\r\nnervous lady medical student, gives to-day in her report \"a feeling of\r\nquiet and calmness, mentally.\" This is a secondary effect, for it was\r\npreceded by \"an unusual rush of blood to the head with a _confused_\r\nfeeling.\"\r\n\r\n\"One swallow does not make a summer,\" neither does one case establish a\r\nremedy; but I think that as _Cactus_ has a clearly defined therapeutic\r\nrange, so it seems that _Crataegus_ may prove a valuable addition to our\r\nmeagre array of heart remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUPHEA VISCOSISSIMA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Lythraceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Clammy cuphea. Tar-weed.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh plant is pounded to a pulp and macerated in two\r\nparts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (In 1888 Dr. A. A. Roth contributed the following\r\n     concerning _Cuphea vis._ to the _Homoeopathic\r\n     Recorder_):\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, whilst battling manfully for the life of a child ill to\r\ndeath from cholera infantum, I was persuaded by a lady friend to use red\r\npennyroyal tea, and to my delight I had the pleasure of seeing a\r\nmarvellous change in less than twenty-four hours. The vomiting ceased\r\npromptly and the bowels gradually became normal. Impressed by this fact,\r\nand also the fact that it was used very extensively in home treatment by\r\ncountry people, I procured the fresh plant, and prepared a tincture as\r\ndirected in the _American Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia_ under article\r\n\"Hedeoma.\" This made a beautiful dark-green tincture, having an aromatic\r\nodor and slightly astringent taste. Of this I gave from five to ten\r\ndrops, according to age, every hour until relieved, and then as often as\r\nneeded, and found it act promptly and effectively. Feeling loath to add\r\nanother remedy to our already over-burdened Materia Medica, I deferred\r\nany mention of the fact; but now after a fair trial for two seasons I\r\nfeel justified in believing that the _Cuphea viscosissima_ will prove a\r\ntreasure in the treatment of cholera infantum. Out of a large number of\r\ncases treated I had but three square failures, and they were\r\ncomplicated with marasmus to an alarming extent before I began the\r\n_Cuphea_; one died and two finally recovered. _Cuphea_ does not act with\r\nequal promptness in all forms of cholera infantum. Two classes of cases\r\nstand out prominently; and first, those arising from acidity of milk or\r\nfood; vomiting of undigested food or curdled milk, with frequent green,\r\nwatery, acid stools, varying in number from five to thirty per day;\r\nchild fretful and feverish; can retain nothing on the stomach; food\r\nseems to pass right through the child. I have frequently had the mother\r\nsay after twenty-four hours' use of _Cuphea_: \"Doctor, the baby is all\r\nright,\" and a very pleasant greeting it is, as we all know. A second\r\nclass is composed of cases in which the stools are decidedly dysenteric,\r\nsmall, frequent, bloody, with tenesmus and great pain; high fever,\r\nrestlessness and sleeplessness. In these two classes _Cuphea_ acts\r\npromptly and generally permanently. It contains a large percentage of\r\ntannic acid, and seems to possess decidedly tonic properties, as\r\nchildren rally rapidly under its use. It utterly failed me in ordinary\r\nforms of diarrhoea, especially in diarrhoeas from colds, etc.; but\r\nin the classes mentioned I have frequently had it produce obstinate\r\nconstipation after several days' use.\r\n\r\n\r\nECHINACEA ANGUSTIFOLIA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Compositae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Pale Purple Cone-flower.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The whole plant including the root is pounded to a pulp\r\nand macerated in two parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (This rather famous drug first came to notice as \"Meyers'\r\n     Blood Purifier;\" the proprietor did not know the name of\r\n     the drug used and sent a whole plant to Professors King\r\n     and Lloyd, of Cincinnati, who identified it as _Echinacea\r\n     angustifolia_, commonly known as \"cone flower,\" \"black\r\n     Sampson,\" \"nigger head,\" etc. If we may believe all that\r\n     has been printed about it the remedy is a veritable\r\n     cure-all. The following, however, is a safe guide; it is\r\n     taken from the paper by Dr. J. Willis Candee in\r\n     Transactions, 1898, of the Homoeopathic Medical Society\r\n     of the State of New York, and credited by Dr. Candee to\r\n     Dr. J. C. Fahnstock):\r\n\r\nHe (Dr. Fahnstock) refers to the clinical application of _Echinacea_,\r\nfrom personal experience, substantially as follows: Cases of shifting\r\npains in rheumatism, for which _Puls._ had been unsuccessfully\r\nprescribed, rapidly disappeared under _Echin._ Several cases of acne\r\nresembling that caused by _Bromide of Potassium_, cured. \"A great\r\nremedy.\" When boils progress to the stage where they appear about to\r\n\"point\" then stop and do not suppurate, _Echinacea_ is the remedy. \"In\r\ncarbuncles with similar symptoms, a bluish-red color and intense pain,\r\nit will in a few hours make your patient grateful to you.\" It is of\r\ngreat value in very fetid ozaena. Beneficial in some cases of\r\nleucorrhoea with discharge bright yellow, as from a suppurating\r\nsurface. Very serviceable in gangrene, where it may be classed with\r\n_Rhus_ and _Arsenicum_, perhaps ranking between them. Has attributed to\r\nit unusually good results in a case of tuberculous disease of hip and in\r\nan old, well-dosed case of destructive syphilis of throat. \"In\r\nsuppurative processes _Echin._ is to be thought of.\"\r\n\r\nIn typhoid fever, diphtheria and appendicitis he has failed to\r\nsubstantiate the claims of other admirers of this remedy.\r\n\r\nThese clinical hints have been given place as naturally following report\r\nof the proving and also because of their coming from a closely observant\r\nhomoeopathist. It is unnecessary at this time to review in detail the\r\nalleged field of usefulness of _Echinacea_. All are familiar with the\r\npublished testimonials and indications, some of which would lead one to\r\nthink that little else is to be desired with which to combat\r\ndegenerative processes in mankind.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand are those, who, having tried the drug without\r\nsatisfactory results, are willing to cast it aside as worthless. To such\r\nit may be well to make these suggestions: 1, to ascertain whether they\r\nhave used a reliable preparation, and 2, to refrain from hasty judgment\r\nuntil guides for prescribing, more accurate than perchance the label on\r\na bottle, shall have been found and consulted.\r\n\r\nMy own limited experience would throw no particular light on the\r\nsubject. It has, however, served to impress me with confidence in the\r\nremedy and its future. The gist of trustworthy clinical findings may be\r\nstated in two words, antiseptic and alterative.\r\n\r\n     (From an article by Dr. H. W. Feller, in the _Eclectic\r\n     Medical Journal_, we quote the following generalities\r\n     concerning this remedy):\r\n\r\nIf any single statement were to be made concerning the virtues of\r\n_Echinacea_ it would read something like this: \"A corrector of the\r\ndeprivation of the body fluids;\" and even this does not sufficiently\r\ncover the ground. Its extraordinary powers--combining essentially that\r\nformerly included under the terms antiseptic, antifermentative, and\r\nantizymotic--are well shown in its power over changes produced in the\r\nfluids of the body, whether from internal causes or from external\r\nintroductions. The changes may be manifested in a disturbed balance of\r\nthe fluids resulting in such tissue alterations as are exhibited in\r\nboils, carbuncles, abscesses, or cellular glandular inflammations. They\r\nmay be from the introduction of serpent or insect venom, or they may be\r\ndue to such fearful poisons as give rise to malignant diphtheria,\r\ncerebro-spinal meningitis, or puerperal and other forms of septicaemia.\r\nSuch changes, whether they be septic or of devitalized morbid\r\naccumulations, or alterations in the fluids themselves, appear to have\r\nmet their Richmond in _Echinacea_. \"Bad blood\" so called, asthenia and\r\nadynamia, and particularly a tendency to malignancy in acute and\r\nsub-acute disorders, seem to be special indicators for the use of\r\n_Echinacea_.\r\n\r\n     (The _North American Journal of Homoeopathy_, December,\r\n     1896, contains a paper on the drug by Dr. Charles F.\r\n     Otis, from which we quote the following):\r\n\r\nI doubt if there are many physicians here assembled, who are general\r\npractitioners, who have not, at some period of their professional lives,\r\ncome in contact with one or both of these diseases either in an epidemic\r\nform or isolated cases, and in instances, have met more than their\r\nmatch; have seen their patients with tongue so swollen that it protruded\r\nfrom the mouth; with membrane gradually extending from the throat into\r\nthe posterior nares, possibly protruding from the nostrils, with the\r\nawful odor so characteristic; with a respiratory sound that told you too\r\nplainly that membrane was extending into the air passages and that the\r\nmisery of your patient would soon cease, not because of your ability to\r\nafford relief, but because death would close the scene.\r\n\r\nI need not complete the picture by mentioning the enormously high\r\ntemperature, the thread-like pulse, the cessation of the action of the\r\nkidneys, the awful agonizing expression of the face, and, perhaps, in\r\nyour efforts, intubation had been practiced without good results. It is\r\nin just this class of cases that _Echinacea_ is king. So reliable has\r\nbeen its action in my hands that I am inclined to give a favorable\r\nprognosis, and if I am so fortunate as to be called early the\r\napplication of the drug in question does not permit of the symptoms just\r\nenumerated. The whole case will usually be changed to one of a mild form\r\nfollowed by a quick recovery.\r\n\r\n     (This from a paper by Dr. W. H. Ramey in _Medical\r\n     Gleaner_):\r\n\r\nIt is a specific, I think, for the condition of the system which sets up\r\nthe boil habit. I never have found a case so bad, and I've had some very\r\nsevere ones, that an ounce and a half of _Echinacea_, taken in ten-drop\r\ndoses four times a day, would not cure. Try it in your cases of\r\nstomatitis with depraved conditions of the system, both internally and\r\nlocally. It has done me valuable service in cases of old ulcers and\r\nunhealthy sores, both as local and internal treatment. Then in your\r\ntyphoid cases, with the characteristic indication, it is simply a\r\nwonderful remedy. I have seen it step in and restore normal conditions\r\nwhen it seemed impossible for remedies to act quick enough to prevent a\r\nfatal termination.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. S. J. Hogan in _Chicago Medical Times_):\r\n\r\nOne other thing I would like to tell about it: I had a case I was\r\ntreating. Among other things, the patient had on the scalp and at the\r\nmargin of the hair on the back of the head a number of wen-like tumors;\r\nsince taking _Echinacea_ they have been entirely absorbed.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Joseph Adolphus in _Medical Gleaner_):\r\n\r\nI have seen its very beneficial action in two epidemics of smallpox. The\r\nremedy did certainly modify the severity of the disease, restrain\r\nsuppuration, check the severity of the symptoms, and promote\r\nconvalescence. I knew of several very desperate cases, which I think\r\nwould have terminated fatally but for the timely use of _Echinacea_. I\r\nfrequently saw cases of severe confluent type, wherein the symptoms were\r\nof a very serious kind, high fever, delirium; some with coma, abominably\r\noffensive odor of body and breath, urine nearly suppressed, eruption\r\nconfluent, exceedingly abundant pus, steadily improve under _Echinacea_\r\ntea taken internally and used locally over the entire body. One of the\r\nvery striking effects of the _Echinacea_ was to abate the dreadfully\r\noffensive odor of the body and breath and modify the acute severity of\r\nthe eruption.\r\n\r\n     (The following proving of _Echinacea_, conducted by Dr.\r\n     J. C. Fahnestock, of Piqua, Ohio, was read before the\r\n     American Institute of Homoeopathy, at Atlantic City,\r\n     1899):\r\n\r\nIt becomes my pleasant duty to place before the American Institute of\r\nHomoeopathy a collection of provings of _Echinacea angustifolia_.\r\n\r\nFour species of this genus are recognized. Two of them, _E. Dicksoni_\r\nand _E. dubia_, are native in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThere are two native in this country, _E. purpurea_, _Moench_. Leaves\r\nrough, often serrate; the lowest ovate, five nerved, veiny, long\r\npetioled; the other ovate-lanceolate; involucre imbricated in three to\r\nfive rows; stem smooth, or in one form rough, bristly, as well as the\r\nleaves. Prairies and banks, from western Pennsylvania and Virginia to\r\nIowa, and southward; occasionally advancing eastward. July--Rays\r\nfifteen to twenty, dull purple (rarely whitish), one to two feet long or\r\nmore. Root thick, black, very pungent to the taste, used in popular\r\nmedicine under the name of Black Sampson. Very variable, and probably\r\nconnects with _E. angustifolia_, described as follows: Leaves, as well\r\nas the slender, simple stem, bristly, hairy, lanceolate and linear\r\nlanceolate, attenuate at base, three nerved, entire; involucre less\r\nimbricated and heads often smaller; rays twelve to fifteen inches, (2)\r\nlong, rose color or red. Plains from Illinois and Wisconsin\r\nsouthward--June to August. This is a brief description of the botany of\r\nthe plant under consideration.\r\n\r\nYour chairman, T. L. Hazard, in his usual characteristic manner, went\r\nvigorously to work and secured all the provers possible. I was also\r\nfortunate enough to secure a number of provers, besides proving and\r\nreproving it myself. The results of all these provings were handed over\r\nto me to present to you in such form as seemed best.\r\n\r\nI must tarry just long enough to preface this collection and tell you\r\nthat explicit printed directions were sent to all the superintendents of\r\nthese provings. This being of too great length, I will give you the most\r\nimportant points in these directions, viz.: Let each prover be furnished\r\nwith a small blank book, in which shall be written date, name, sex,\r\nresidence, height, weight, temperament, color of eyes, color of hair,\r\ncomplexion; describe former ailments and present physical condition. In\r\nconcluding give pulse in different positions, respiration, temperature,\r\nfunction of digestion, analysis of excretions, especially the urine;\r\nanalysis of the blood, family history, habits, idiosyncrasy, etc.\r\n\r\nThe different colleges and universities were called upon to assist on\r\nthese provings. The following institutions responded to the call:\r\nCleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, the Chicago, Iowa City, and Ann\r\nArbor. None of the eastern institutions responded; don't know whether\r\ndead or just hibernating.\r\n\r\nI wish to publicly express my thanks to all who have taken part in\r\nthese provings. I think it but just to state that the University of\r\nMichigan furnished the best provings. Thanks also are extended to\r\nBoericke & Tafel for remedy furnished in the [Greek: theta], 3x, 30x,\r\nwhich were also used in the provings. One lady, who commenced the\r\nproving and had begun to develop valuable provings, contracted a severe\r\ncold and stopped, for which I am very sorry. All the rest of the provers\r\nwere males; medical students or physicians. Only a very few symptoms\r\nwere produced by the use of the 30x attenuation, a greater number of\r\nprovers not recording any at all.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms here compiled were produced by the 3x attenuation and the\r\ntincture, using from one drop to thirty drops at a dose. In proving and\r\nthen compiling the symptoms produced by this drug, I am fully aware of\r\nthe many difficulties to be met on every side.\r\n\r\nThe one great trouble that I find is that those who are unaccustomed to\r\nproving do not observe what really is going on while attempting to make\r\na proving, and are not capable of expressing the conditions so produced.\r\nI find that there are few who can take drugs and accurately define their\r\neffects. In selecting and discriminating the effects of drugs there must\r\nexist a mental superiority, and no man had this genius so highly\r\ndeveloped as Hahnemann.\r\n\r\nAfter making three different provings upon myself, I have undertaken to\r\nselect those symptoms which to the best of my ability were found in all\r\nof these different provings.\r\n\r\nI have taken special care not to omit any symptoms, even though it may\r\nhave been noticed by but one prover; but in the majority of cases you\r\nwill notice the symptoms occurred two or more times in different\r\nindividuals, thus confirming the genuineness of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nNot giving you the day-book records of these provers, a few remarks,\r\nshowing its general action, may not be out of place. As stated before,\r\nonly two recorded symptoms after the use of the 30x attenuation.\r\n\r\nAfter taking the tincture, there is soon produced a biting, tingling\r\nsensation of the tongue, lips and fauces, not very much unlike the\r\nsensation produced by _Aconite_. In these provers there soon followed a\r\nsense of fear, with pain about the heart, and accelerated pulse. In a\r\nshort time there was noticed a dull pain in both temples, a pressing\r\npain; then shooting pains, which followed the fifth pair of nerves.\r\n\r\nThe next symptom produced was an accumulation of sticky mucus in mouth\r\nand fauces. Then a general languor and weakness followed, always worse\r\nin the afternoon. All the limbs felt weak and indisposed to make any\r\nmotion, and this was accompanied by sharp, shooting, shifting pains. In\r\nquite a number of cases the appetite was not affected.\r\n\r\nThose using sufficient quantity of the tincture had loss of appetite,\r\nwith belching of tasteless gas, weakness in the stomach, pain in the\r\nright hypochondriac region, accompanied with gas in the bowels; griping\r\npains followed by passing offensive flatus, or a loose, yellowish stool,\r\nwhich always produced great exhaustion. After using the drug several\r\ndays the face becomes pale, the pulse very much lessened in frequency,\r\nand a general exhaustion follows like after a severe and long spell of\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nThe tongue will then indicate slow digestion, accompanied with belching\r\nof tasteless gas. In most of the provers, however, there was a passing\r\nof very offensive gas and offensive stools.\r\n\r\nYou will observe that the remedy exerts quite an effect on the kidneys\r\nand bladder, but I am very sorry to say that the urinary analysis made\r\ndid not show anything but the variations generally observed in ordinary\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nI must say that the provers did not go into the details as much as was\r\ndesirable. Likewise, I may say the same of the blood tests made, but\r\nwhat was given is very valuable.\r\n\r\nI could give you an expression of its special action, but will merely\r\ngive you the symptoms collected and then you can make your own\r\ndeductions.\r\n\r\n\r\nECHINACEA ANGUSTIFOLIA.\r\n\r\nA collection of symptoms from twenty-five different provers,\r\nanatomically

ORD., Ericaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Trailing Arbutus. Ground Laurel. Gravel Root.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh leaves are pounded to a pulp and macerated in\r\ntwo parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (In the subjoined paper by Dr. E. M. Hale, _North\r\n     American Journal of Homoeopathy_, 1869, the old\r\n     doctrine of signatures seems to crop out again.)\r\n\r\nThe _Gravel Root_ has long had some reputation in urinary difficulties,\r\nand even in calculous affections. The common appellation of \"Gravel\r\nroot\" shows that the popular belief points in the direction of its use.\r\n\r\nI have never tested its virtues but in one instance, and its effects\r\nseemed to be so decided and curative that I deem the case worthy of\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nA young man, aged twenty-three, applied for treatment of a long array of\r\nsymptoms, some of which seemed to indicate _enlargement of the\r\nprostate_, and others a _vesical catarrh_.\r\n\r\nThe _quantity_ of urine was nearly normal.\r\n\r\nThe _quality_ was decidedly abnormal. It contained a large amount of\r\nmucus, the phosphates, some blood, and a little pus. It was dark red,\r\ncolored blue litmus paper red (showing its acid condition).\r\n\r\nThe pain was similar to a vesical tenesmus, a pain in the region of the\r\nneck of the bladder and prostate gland. Pressure in the perineum was\r\npainful.\r\n\r\nHe had been under the most atrocious allopathic treatment; had been\r\ndrugged with copaiva, spts. nitric.-dulc., turpentine, tincture muriate\r\nof iron, and other diuretics in enormous doses.\r\n\r\nI commenced the treatment with _Sulphur_ 30th, three doses a day for a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nBy this time he had eliminated the drug-poisons from his system, and the\r\nreal symptoms of the malady began to appear uncomplicated. The blood and\r\npus disappeared from the urine, there was less mucus, and the urine was\r\nof a lighter color.\r\n\r\nA red, sandy sediment, however, remained. This sediment was not \"gritty\"\r\nunder the finger, at least no such sensation was perceptible.\r\n\r\nSecond prescription: _Lycopodium_ 30th and 6th, the former in the\r\nmorning, the latter in evening, for a week. No improvement except a\r\nslight diminution of the sediment.\r\n\r\nNo medicine was given for four days, at which time there appeared\r\ndysuria, pain in the region of the prostate, mucous sediment, and\r\nitching at the orifice of the urethra.\r\n\r\nWhile undecided as to the next prescription, I happened to take up a\r\nvial of tincture _Epigea repens_, which I had prepared from the fresh\r\nplant, while on a visit to Mackinaw six months before. Knowing the high\r\nestimate placed on this plant, by the people, in the treatment of gravel\r\nI resolved to test its virtues. Ten drops of the mother tincture were\r\nprescribed, to be taken every four hours.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards my patient brought me several small brownish\r\nparticles, having the appearance of fine sand. When crushed and pressed\r\nbetween the fingers they had a decidedly gritty feel. Under the\r\nmicroscope they had the appearance of rough coarse sand. The discharge\r\nof calculi kept up for nearly a week, under the use of the _Epigea_, and\r\nthen ceased, and with it all the symptoms of irritation of the bladder.\r\n\r\nIt is just possible that the discharge of gravel may have been a\r\ncoincidence. It is equally possible that the _Lycopodium_ acted\r\ncuratively; but I am inclined to believe their disintegration and\r\nexpulsion was caused or aided by the use of the last medicine.\r\n\r\nFurther observations are needed to place the curative powers of this\r\nplant on a certain basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nERYNGIUM AQUATICUM.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Umbeliferae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Button Snakeroot. Water Eryngo.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh root is pounded to a pulp and macerated in two\r\nparts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Although a well-known remedy, the following concerning\r\n     its early history may not be out of place here. It is\r\n     from Thomas' _Additions_.)\r\n\r\n\"For spermatorrhoea properly so called, or emission of semen without\r\nerections, there is no remedy which has yet received the sanction of\r\nexperience.\"--_Repertory._\r\n\r\n\"We have one, however, to propose for trial--it is the _Eryngium\r\naquaticum_, which has two remarkable cures, reported by Dr. Parks\r\n(Pharmacentist, Cin.), to recommend it.\r\n\r\n\"CASE I.--A married man injured his testicles by jumping upon a horse;\r\nthis was followed by a discharge of what was considered semen for\r\nfifteen years, during which time he was treated allopathically and\r\nhomoeopathically. Dr. Parks exhibited a number of the usual remedies\r\nwithout permanent benefit. He then gave a half-grain dose, three times a\r\nday, of the third decimal trituration of the '_Eryngium aquaticum_.' In\r\nfive days the emissions were entirely suppressed, and have not returned\r\nto this time (over two years ago). The emissions were without erections\r\nday or night, and followed by great lassitude.\r\n\r\n\"CASE II.--A married man, not conscious of having sustained any injury,\r\nwas troubled for eight or ten years with emissions at night--with\r\nerections. The semen also passed by day with the urine. The loss of\r\nsemen was followed by great lassitude and depression, continuing from\r\ntwelve to forty-eight hours. There was also partial impotence. Had been\r\ntreated allopathically. Dr. Parks gave him Phos. acid for two weeks,\r\nwithout material benefit. He then exhibited the _Eryngium aquaticum_, as\r\nabove, with the like excellent and prompt result.\"[I]\r\n\r\n    [I] Drs. Hill and Hunt, Homoeopathic Surgery.\r\n\r\nI used this remedy with a patient who was quite broken down from\r\nspermatorrhoea; the emissions left him, but he suffered from vertigo\r\nand dim-sightedness whenever he took a dose of the medicine. He is now\r\nwell through the use of other medicines. Our English _Eryngo_--the _E.\r\nmaritimum_, is noted as an aphrodisiac, and is very similar in\r\nappearance to the _Eryngium aquaticum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUPHORBIA COROLLATA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Euphorbiaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Milk Weed. Wild Ipecac. Blooming or Flowering Spurge.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh root is pounded to a pulp and macerated in two\r\nparts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (In _North American Journal of Homoeopathy_, Dr. E. M.\r\n     Hale has, among other things, the following to say of\r\n     this drug):\r\n\r\nIts action on the system is intense and peculiar. It is called by the\r\ncountry people by the expressive name of _Go-quick_, referring to its\r\nquick and prompt action. I am indebted to Dr. A. R. Brown, of\r\nLitchfield, Mich., for many interesting facts relating to its action. It\r\nis considered, by those who use it, as the most powerful \"revulsive\r\nagent\" in their Materia Medica, in all cases of local congestion,\r\nespecially of the lungs and head; also in inflammation of the pleura,\r\nlungs, and liver, and is used as a substitute for bleeding and Calomel.\r\nIts admirers allege that it will certainly _arrest_ the progress of the\r\nabove affections in a few hours, and break up all simple fevers. This is\r\nof course erroneous, but it reminds one of the Helleborine of the\r\nancients, so graphically described by Hahnemann. In fact no drug with\r\nwhich I am acquainted so much resembles the _Veratrum album_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAGOPYRUM.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Polygonaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Buckwheat.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh mature plant is pounded to a pulp and macerated\r\nin two parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following paper was published in the Transactions of\r\n     the Homoeopathic Society of Maine in 1895. It is by Dr.\r\n     D. C. Perkins, of Rockland, Me.)\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no well proven remedy in the Materia Medica, of equal\r\nvalue to that of which I present a brief study, that has been so wholly\r\noverlooked by the homoeopathic profession. There certainly is none\r\nwhich possesses a more marked individuality, and which more fully fills\r\na place by itself. It is safe to say that not one in ten of those who\r\npractice the healing art has ever used it or is familiar with its\r\npathogenesis. Having not unfrequently cured cases with it, which had\r\nrefused to yield to other remedies apparently well indicated, I have\r\ncome to regard it as among the important drugs in our super-abundant\r\nMateria Medica. Its effects upon mental conditions are marked by\r\ndepression of spirits, irritability, inability to study, or to remember\r\nwhat has been read, bringing to our minds _Aconite_, _Bryonia_,\r\n_Chamomilla_, _Coffea_, _Colocynth_, _Ignatia_, _Lachesis_, _Mercury_,\r\n_Nux vomica_, _Staphisagria_, _Stramonium_, and _Veratrum_. Its effects\r\nupon the head are deep-seated and persistent. There is vertigo,\r\nconfusion, severe pain in many parts of head, with upward pressure\r\ndescribed as of a bursting character. The pain may be in forehead, back\r\nof eyes, through temporal region on either side, but always of a\r\npressive or bursting nature. For congestive headaches it is as valuable\r\nas _Belladonna_, _Glonoine_, _Nux vomica_, or _Sepia_.\r\n\r\nIn and about the eyes there is itching, smarting, swelling, heat and\r\nsoreness; the itching being especially marked and usually regarded as\r\ncharacteristic. The last named symptom is no less prominent in\r\naffections of the ears, as has often been shown in the efficacy of\r\nbuckwheat flour in frost-bites, or erysipelas of those useful organs,\r\nfrom time immemorial. Here the similarity to _Agaricus_ will readily be\r\nrecognized. The nose does not escape. It is swollen, red, inflamed and\r\nsore. There is at first fluent coryza with sneezing, followed by\r\nfulness, dryness and the formation of crusts. Nor is the burning absent\r\nwhich has been elsewhere noted. There is much soreness and somewhat\r\npersistent pain from even gentle pressure.\r\n\r\nThe face is pale or unevenly flushed, with dark semi-circles below the\r\neyes. Later, the face becomes swollen, hot and dry, as though severely\r\nsunburnt, and the lips are cracked and sore. The mouth feels dry and\r\nhot, and yet saliva is not wanting. There is soreness and swelling of\r\nroof of mouth, and the tongue is red and fissured along its edges. The\r\nbad taste in the morning reminds us of _Pulsatilla_.\r\n\r\nIn the throat, there is soreness with pain just back of the isthmus of\r\nthe fauces, a feeling of excoriation and soreness extending deep down in\r\nthe pharynx. The uvula is elongated, the tonsils are swollen and red,\r\nthere is a sensation of rawness in the throat strikingly reminding us of\r\n_Phytolacca_. Externally, there is scarlet redness of the neck below the\r\nmastoid process, throbbing of the carotids, the neck feels tired, the\r\nhead heavy and the parotid glands are swollen and painful. It is\r\nunnecessary to name the remedy having similar symptoms.\r\n\r\nWhile the symptoms produced on the digestive tract are not characterized\r\nby that intensity noted elsewhere, they are still valuable. There is\r\npersistent morning nausea which should lead us to study this remedy in\r\nthe vomiting of pregnancy. Contrary to _Lycopodium_ and _Nux moschata_\r\nthe appetite is improved by eating. The empty or \"all-gone\" feeling at\r\nthe stomach is like that of _Sepia_.\r\n\r\nIn the abdomen there is fulness and pain but no rumbling. Discharges of\r\nflatus are frequent and annoying. The region of the liver is painful,\r\ntender and there is aggravation from pressure, compelling the patient to\r\nlie on the left side. The stools are pappy, or watery, profuse,\r\noffensive and followed by tenesmus.\r\n\r\nOn the male genital organs there is profuse perspiration of an offensive\r\nodor. The urine is scalding, and pain extends from testicles to abdomen.\r\nIn females the drug acts with force upon the right ovary, producing pain\r\nof a bruised or burning character, noted particularly when walking.\r\nThere is pruritus with slight yellow leucorrhoea, the discharge being\r\nmore noticed when at rest than when exercising. So far as known this\r\nlatter symptom does not occur under the action of any other remedy.\r\n\r\nIn the chest we find a heavy, pulsating pain extending to all its parts.\r\nThis is persistent, and is worse from a deep inspiration. Around the\r\nheart there are dull pains with oppression and occasional sharp pains\r\npassing through the heart. Pressure with the hand increases the\r\noppression. The pulse is increased but is extremely variable. There is\r\nreason to believe that _Cactus grandiflora_, or _Spigelia_ are often\r\ngiven in affections of the heart, where _Fagopyrum_, if given, would\r\naccomplish better results.\r\n\r\nOn the muscular system the action of the remedy stands out in bold\r\nrelief. There is stiffness and soreness of all the muscles of the neck,\r\nwith pain, and a feeling as if the neck would hardly support the head.\r\nPains extend from occiput to back of neck and are relieved by bending\r\nthe head backward. There are dull pains in small of back, with stitching\r\npains in the region of the kidneys. Pains with occasional sharp stitches\r\nextend from the arms to muscles of both sides of chest. Rheumatic pains\r\nin the shoulders of a dull aching character. Stinging and burning pains\r\nextend the whole length of fingers, aggravated by motion. Streaking\r\npains pass through arms and legs with sharp pains extending to feet.\r\nPains extend from hips to small of back, and these also frequently run\r\ndown to the feet. In the knees there is dull pain and weakness, while\r\ndeep in the limbs there is burning and stinging. There is numbness in\r\nthe limbs, with dragging in the joints, especially right knee, hip and\r\nelbow. Stooping to write causes constant severe pain through chest and\r\nin region of liver. This group of symptoms gives _Fagopyrum_ a striking\r\nindividuality and establishes it in an uncontested position among the\r\nlong list of remedies prescribed for rheumatic complaints.\r\n\r\nScarcely less important are the symptoms of the skin. There is intense\r\nitching of the arms and legs, becoming worse toward evening. Blotches\r\nlike flea-bites appear in many localities, sometimes all over the body,\r\nare sore to the touch and are multiplied by scratching. These eruptions\r\nare persistent and the itching is intense. Blind boils may be developed\r\nand attain a large size. The itching of the face is especially marked\r\nabout the roots of the whiskers. Itching of the hands which is \"deep in\"\r\nis persistent and annoying, this condition being supposed to be the\r\nresult of irritation of the coats of the arteries.\r\n\r\nThe sleepiness is unlike that of _Belladonna_, _Nux vomica_, _Sepia_ or\r\n_Sulphur_, occurring early in the evening and characterized by\r\nstretching and yawning. It is not profound, and when the mind is\r\ndiverted the patient gets wide awake, but soon relapses unless\r\nconversation is continued. In bed, sleep is disturbed by troublesome\r\ndreams and frequent waking. Aggravations occur after retiring, ascending\r\nstairs, from deep inspiration, walking in bright sunlight, lying on\r\nright side, riding in cars, and when stooping or writing. Ameliorations\r\noccur after taking coffee, from cold applications, from motion in cold\r\nair, and from sitting still in warm room.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAGUS SYLVATICUS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Cupuliferae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, European Beech.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The Beech Nuts are pounded to a pulp and macerated in five\r\nparts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (In volume XIII of the _American Observer_, Dr. E. W.\r\n     Berridge, contributes the following concerning the action\r\n     of _Fagus sylvaticus_ or Beech nuts):\r\n\r\n\r\nBEECH NUTS. (From _Medical Museum_--_London, 1781_--_vol. ii., pp. 97,\r\n294._) From a dissertation on hydrophobia, by Christian Frederick\r\nSeleg, M. D., of Enbenstoff, in Saxony, printed in Eslong, in 1762.\r\n\r\nA boy aged 13 had eaten four days ago a large quantity of beech nuts. I\r\nfound him in great pain, languid, and terrified with apprehensions of\r\npresent death. Pulse very unequal, sometimes extremely quick, sometimes\r\nlanguid and intermittent; skin burning violently; mouth flowing with\r\nfroth and saliva, intolerable thirst, entreating for drink, but as soon\r\nas any liquid was brought he seemed to shudder with equal horror, as if\r\nhe had been eating unripe grapes. Soon after eating the nuts he had been\r\nseized with torpor, gloominess and dread of liquids. He had not been\r\nbitten by any rabid animal.\r\n\r\nNext (5th) day, early in the morning, he was the same, but seemed to\r\ntalk more in his wildness and perturbation of mind, and his mouth flowed\r\nwith foam more abundantly; the urine he had voided by night was red and\r\nfirey, depositing a copious turbid white sediment, resembling an\r\nemulsion of beech nuts, subsiding as deep as the breadth of the finger\r\nat the bottom of the vessel. A few hours before he died he vomited a\r\nporraceous bile, after which he died quietly.\r\n\r\nThe author in the _original_ work gives a number of fatal cases of\r\n_spontaneous_ hydrophobia. This work should be examined.\r\n\r\nJohn Bauhin (_Hist. Plants_, vol. i, pp. 2, 121) says that the nuts will\r\ndisorder the head like darnel; hogs grow stupid and drowsy by feeding on\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nRay (_Hist. of Plants_, tom. ii, p. 1382) and Mangetus (_Biblioth.\r\nPharm._, vol. i, p. 910) says the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAXINUS EXCELSIOR.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Oleaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, European Ash.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh leaves are pounded to a pulp and macerated with\r\ntwo parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (In the _Union Medicale_, November, 1852, two French\r\n     physicians detailed several cases of gout and rheumatism\r\n     treated with _Fraxinus excelsior_, or ash leaves, one of\r\n     Rademacher's favorite remedies. Of the two physicians,\r\n     one of them, Dr. Peyraud, was himself relieved of the\r\n     gout by this treatment.)\r\n\r\nAsh-leaves were highly recommended by Rademacher, and have been quite\r\nextensively used in Germany on his suggestion. In the _Union Medicale_\r\nfor Nov. 27, 1852, two French physicians, Drs. Pouget and Peyraud,\r\ndetailed several cases of gout and rheumatism cured by an infusion of\r\nash-leaves in boiling water. Dr. Peyraud himself was one of those\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\n\"In 1842, Dr. Peyraud had his first attack of gout, which was severe,\r\nand lasted for twenty-five days. During the three following years the\r\nattacks increased in frequency and severity. Having derived little\r\nbenefit from the remedial means which he had resorted to, he listened to\r\nthe suggestion of one of his patients, an inhabitant of the department\r\nof Dordogne, in France, who advised him to try an infusion of\r\nash-leaves, informing him, at the same time, that his forefathers had\r\nbeen cured by this prescription, and that many of the country people got\r\nrid of 'their pains' by employing it. Dr. Peyraud took the infusion of\r\nash-leaves and from 1845 to 1849 had no fit of gout. He then had an\r\nattack, which yielded in five days to the infusion of ash-leaves, used\r\nunder the observation of Dr. Pouget. These circumstances recalled to the\r\nrecollection of Dr. Pouget a fact which he might otherwise never again\r\nhave considered. It was this: that when he was a physician at Soreze, in\r\n1824, the peasants of that place had spoken to him of the great power\r\nwhich an infusion of ash-leaves had in driving away pains. He afterwards\r\ndiscovered that it had been used forty years ago as a gout-specific by\r\nthe peasants of Auvergne.\r\n\r\n\"A commercial traveller, who had been gouty for twenty years, and had\r\nsaturated himself with the syrup of Boubee and other vaunted specifics,\r\nconsulted Dr. Pouget. At this time he was an almost constant prisoner in\r\nhis room with successive attacks. After eleven days' use of the\r\ninfusion, he was able to walk two kilometres (one and a quarter English\r\nmiles); in fifteen days he resumed his journeys, and was able to travel\r\nwithout suffering, by diligence, from Bordeaux to Quimper.\r\n\r\n\"Several other cases are detailed, some of them acute, and others\r\nchronic. Articular rheumatism, in numerous instances, was also benefited\r\nby the infusion of ash-leaves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFUCUS VESICULOSIS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Algae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Sea-wrack. Bladder-wrack. Sea-kelp.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh alga gathered in May or June are pounded to a\r\npulp and macerated in two parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following letter, by Dr. J. Herbert Knapp to the\r\n     _Homoeopathic Recorder_, was published in 1896):\r\n\r\nAfter treating many cases of exophthalmic goitre, I have come to the\r\nconclusion that I have found a specific for that disease in _Fucus\r\nvesiculosis_ (sea-wrack). I might record one case. Mrs. Mary B., aet. 24\r\nyears, German, came into my clinic at the Brooklyn E. D. Homoeopathic\r\nDispensary to be treated for swelling of the neck of several years'\r\nduration. I gave her the tincture of _Fucus ves._, thirty drops three\r\ntimes a day. The treatment began December 1, 1895, and patient was\r\ndischarged cured, on October 2, 1896. Would be pleased to hear from any\r\nothers who have had any experience with _Fucus vesiculosis_.\r\n\r\n     (The foregoing brought out this by Dr. R. N. Foster, of\r\n     Chicago):\r\n\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to be able to say a word confirmatory of the\r\nremarks made in your December issue by J. Herbert Knapp, M. D.,\r\nrespecting the above named drug.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, while turning over the pages of that very useful book,\r\n\"The American Eclectic Dispensatory,\" by John King, M. D., I chanced to\r\nnotice the following sentences: \"_Fucus vesiculosis_, sea-wrack, or\r\nbladder-wrack,... has a peculiar odor, and a nauseous saline taste....\r\nThe charcoal of this plant has long had the reputation of a deobstruent,\r\nand been given in goitre and scrofulous swelling.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as I now remember, this is the only hint I ever received which\r\nled me to try the drug in goitre. At the same time, I do not feel sure\r\nof this. Perhaps I had met in some medical journal a statement\r\nrespecting the relation of this drug to goitre, which fact led me to\r\nlook it up in the \"Eclectic Dispensatory.\" But if so, I cannot recall\r\nthe authority. At all events, I was led to try the remedy in a\r\npronounced case of goitre, with such good results that I have never\r\nsince given any other remedy for that disease, either in the\r\nexophthalmic or in the uncomplicated form. And what is more, I have\r\nnever known it to fail to cure when the patient was under thirty years\r\nof age. After that time of life, or about that period, it seems to be no\r\nlonger efficacious.\r\n\r\nI have now used it on more than twenty-four cases, with the same\r\nunvarying result, and never with any other result--that is, no\r\nunpleasant consequences have ever accompanied or followed its use.\r\n\r\nI published this fact in the _Medical Investigator_ after I had used it\r\nin a few cases, and again announced it in the Chicago Homoeopathic\r\nMedical Society still later; and again have frequently repeated it with\r\ngrowing confidence and of greater numbers of cases in medical societies,\r\nin colleges, and in private conversation with physicians.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the fact is so utterly unknown that your journal publishes Dr.\r\nKnapp's inquiry respecting it, which shows how easily a good thing may\r\nbe forgotten, and how readily a genuine specific may be superseded by a\r\nhost of abortive procedures right under the eyes of the profession. It\r\nis most probable that more real good things have been forgotten or cast\r\naside in medicine than it now, or at any one time, possesses.\r\n\r\nRespecting this _Fucus vesiculosis_ and its use in goitre, I would like\r\nto add a few words. The drug is of variable quality. If one specimen\r\nfails to give satisfaction it ought to be discarded and another tried.\r\nThe pharmacist must be importuned to make special efforts to give us an\r\narticle that is not inert, but contains all the activity that belongs to\r\nthe drug.\r\n\r\nTime is required for effecting a cure. This varies according to the age\r\nand size of the goitre. Three months may suffice for a small goitre of\r\none year's growth. Six months may be required for one twice as large and\r\nof longer standing. A year and a half is the longest period during which\r\nI have had to continue the medicine. But during all that time the goitre\r\nwas manifestly diminishing.\r\n\r\nThe dose is a teaspoonful of the tincture twice or three times daily, in\r\na well-developed case. Half a teaspoonful twice a day will answer in\r\nrecent cases.\r\n\r\nSmaller doses seem not to produce any effect.\r\n\r\nThe medicine is very unpleasant to the taste, but causes no disturbance\r\nafter it has been taken. It ought to be taken, each dose in about two\r\nounces of water, and preferably between meals.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAULTHERIA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Ericaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Wintergreen.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The distilled oil from the leaves of Gaultheria procumbens\r\nis used and dispensed in one or two drop tablets.\r\n\r\n     (These two papers were contributed to the _Homoeopathic\r\n     Recorder_, 1894, by Dr. Benj. F. Lang, York, Nebraska, on\r\n     the action of _Gaultheria_.)\r\n\r\nMy attention was first called to its use about ten years ago in southern\r\nOhio, where I received most pleasing results in the treatment of\r\ninflammatory rheumatism. Afterwards to a somewhat more disagreeable\r\nclass of complaints in form of neuralgia. While I am not a champion of\r\nany specific, I want to say that this drug has given me the quickest and\r\nmost satisfactory results of any remedy in the Materia Medica. If there\r\nis anything that a man wants relief from quick and \"now,\" it is from\r\nthese excruciating pains. Often was I called to treat some obstinate\r\ncases of ciliary neuralgia, or facial, or in fact nearly every form of\r\nneuralgia, and found my skill taxed to its utmost to bring out the balm.\r\nDid I find it in the homoeopathic indicated remedy? I trust so, but\r\nnot in any Materia Medica. I don't say but what I got some results from\r\nthem, but I found it in this a \"helper;\" it came to my relief\r\nimmediately and to the great comfort of the patient. In severest cases\r\nof neuralgias of the head and face it would do its work quick and well.\r\nEqually well has it served me in very severe cases of neuralgia of\r\nstomach and bowels, while for the past few years it has done faithful\r\nwork in ovarian and uterine neuralgias following or preceding difficult\r\nmenstruation. I have many a dear friend to-day whose relief from\r\nsuffering was found in this remedy.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that it should be given a prominent place in our Materia\r\nMedica. Lest this article should become tedious, I will cite a few\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nMr. A., travelling man from Chicago, a few years ago called on me for\r\ntemporary relief of a severe case of ciliary neuralgia; said he had\r\nsuffered for many years with it, every spring especially, and that he\r\nhad consulted great numbers of physicians of Chicago, Milwaukee and\r\nCincinnati, and, as he said, \"had taken bushels of drugs, both old and\r\nnew school,\" with only temporary relief. So he expected nothing more, as\r\nhe was told he must wear it out. I told him I thought I could give him\r\nrelief. I furnished him one-half ounce of _Gaultheria_, with directions\r\nto take; did not see him again for two years, when he came into my\r\noffice one day and greeted me by saying I was the only man that could\r\never give him any permanent relief from his sufferings; that he never\r\nhad any return after first day taking medicine, and unlike most patrons\r\nwanted to make me a present of a $5 (five dollar bill), which of course\r\nno doctor refuses. I cite this first, as it was of long standing and had\r\ntested the ability of a number of prominent men.\r\n\r\nMiss B., dressmaker, came to me suffering terribly with facial neuralgia\r\nand greeted me similar to No. 1; that she expected nothing but temporary\r\nrelief, as she had been afflicted for a long time. Gave her two (2)\r\ndrachms of oil W.; told her to take one dose immediately and another in\r\ntwo hours if the pain did not quiet down. She was careful to ask if it\r\nwas an opiate, as she objected to that. I assured her it was not; saw\r\nher next day, said that pain disappeared and had not returned. I was\r\nacquainted with the lady for three and one-half years, and she only had\r\none return of the disease, which the same remedy relieved immediately.\r\nMany cases more could I cite in which it never has failed me.\r\n\r\nMrs. G., No. 3. I was called to relieve a severe case of neuralgia of\r\nstomach and bowels this last summer, who had been under the care of two\r\nof my worthy competitors. They had exhausted their pill case, and for\r\nabout three weeks the poor woman had suffered everything but death\r\nitself. After diagnosing the case I put her on this remedy, and in two\r\nhours she was relieved and after two days was able to be about, and was\r\ncured shortly by no other remedy than it. I want to say you will find a\r\ntrue friend in this remedy in all forms of neuralgia, and only give a\r\nfew suggestions now; but if it should be necessary could give scores to\r\nprove its value.\r\n\r\nI mentioned in the beginning that it had been of great value in\r\ninflammatory rheumatism. So it has, and will give later many cases of\r\nimmediate and permanent relief if it would be of any value to the\r\nprofession. A word as to the best way of giving the drug. I have found\r\nthat the dose should never be less than five drops, and if pain is\r\nsevere fifteen drops repeated in half hour; afterward two hours apart.\r\nFor adult it may be necessary to give twenty drops at first. It always\r\nshould be dropped on sugar and taken.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion: I would like to have it put in a tablet of about two to\r\nfive drops pure oil, as I think it could be taken more satisfactorily.\r\nWhile the crude oil is very pleasant to take at first, yet, on account\r\nof its strong odor, will nauseate after awhile if not removed from room.\r\nI am confident that if you make this into a tablet and place it among\r\nyour remedies you would have a weapon that you could place into the\r\nhands of doctors of untold value in these troubles.\r\n\r\n     (The latter part of the foregoing communication was\r\n     addressed to Messrs. Boericke & Tafel, homoeopathic\r\n     pharmacists. This was followed by a second communication\r\n     reading as follows):\r\n\r\nSince the few lines written for the last issue of _Recorder_ on\r\n_Gaultheria_ in treatment of neuralgia, I have been asked to write my\r\nexperience with it in inflammatory rheumatism.\r\n\r\nIt has never failed me in this terrible disease to give relief. My\r\nexperience with it dates back to the fall of 1884, in Ross county, Ohio,\r\nwhere I was called to treat a very stubborn case, then under the\r\ntreatment of one of my old school friends. The patient, a lady about\r\nfifty years old, had suffered with two previous attacks, lasting about\r\nthree months each time. At the time I was called to treat her she had\r\nbeen confined to bed about four weeks. She was suffering intensely, the\r\njoints of upper and lower limbs being swollen and extremely tender; in\r\nfact, so sensitive that one could scarcely walk about the bed without\r\ncausing great suffering; temperature, 103; pulse weak and intermittent.\r\nAt my first visit, 2:30 P.M., I ordered all of the joints to be wrapped\r\nwith cotton, to exclude all air. I then gave her _Bry._ On my return,\r\nnext day, I did not find much improvement, excepting the nausea, which\r\nwas due to heroic drugging she had been subjected to. Continued _Bry._\r\nThe next day the appetite some better, but joints still very tender;\r\ntemperature and pulse about the same; some difficulty in respiration. I\r\nthen resolved to try _Gaultheria_. I left one drachm vial of the remedy\r\nand ordered the same to be divided into two equal doses, one-half at one\r\no'clock P.M., the balance at five o'clock P.M.\r\n\r\nAt about 7:30 of the same evening a messenger came into town in great\r\nhaste, saying my patient was failing very fast, and requested me to come\r\nout as soon as possible. On my arrival at the home I found the patient\r\nsitting by the fire. The husband informed me that he thought she was\r\nlosing her mind. I asked her why she was out of bed; she said she saw no\r\nreason for staying in bed after a patient was well, and further said\r\nthat about one hour after taking the first dose she began to move\r\neasily, and after taking second dose all of the soreness and swelling\r\nleft the joints. She also said she was all right; that we need not feel\r\nalarmed about her. I made only one visit after; continued the same\r\nremedy; there were no relapses.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. A prominent woman in Nebraska had been under treatment for ten\r\ndays with free old-line medication, Dover's powders and _Morphia_ as\r\npalliatives. Husband consulted me to know whether anything could be\r\ngiven to relieve her suffering. I called and found her with temperature\r\n102, pulse 105, left (hand) fingers and elbow joints swollen, very\r\nsensitive to touch or movement. I at once assured her that I thought she\r\nwould get relief without any more _Morphia_. Gave her one-half drachm\r\n_Gaultheria_ and requested her to take twenty drops in two hours if pain\r\nand soreness was not relieved. This was about 4 P.M. I met her husband\r\nnext morning on street on my way to visit her again and he said \"that he\r\nhardly thought it necessary, as his wife was relieved in about one hour\r\nafter taking first dose and felt no pain after second, and that she was\r\nup dressing her hair when he left home.\" She had a slight return on\r\naccount of overwork, but remedy always gave relief and made firm patrons\r\nof one of our best families for me. I always advise patients to wrap\r\nthe joints with cotton to exclude air and advise them to keep quiet.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Young man, twenty-eight; had two attacks before, one lasting\r\nthree months, the second ten weeks. This was the worst case that I have\r\never treated. As the heart was very weak, pulse intermittent, I put him\r\non the remedy, _Gaultheria_, with almost immediate relief, but second\r\nday there was relapse, which again responded immediately to treatment by\r\nsame remedy; with this, or in connection with this remedy, I used some\r\n_Bry._ 3 and _Rhus tox._ 3. I dismissed him in ten days, more than\r\npleased, as we were always able to control the pain immediately without\r\nany other remedy than _Gaultheria_.\r\n\r\nI cite these cases among the many that I have had, and have never failed\r\nto get good results in any; will say that I give any other remedy after\r\nsoreness and swelling are removed that may be indicated, always taking\r\nthe necessary precaution to exclude all air from parts affected and to\r\nkeep them warm. About three hours apart is as often as I give remedy,\r\nand always careful to give it on sugar and remove it from room, with\r\n_spoon used_.\r\n\r\nNo. 4. Since my article on neuralgia I had a quite severe case of\r\nsciatica that had taxed the skill of one of my worthy competitors for\r\nnearly two months without any good results; he was about to go to Hot\r\nSprings for some relief. Meeting me on the street, wanted to know if I\r\nthought any of my \"little pills or drops would give any relief.\" I\r\nassured him that I was quite positive that I could. He could hardly move\r\nabout, and suffered very much if he did; he came and got a prescription\r\nand found relief to his great astonishment almost immediately; has had\r\nit refilled twice and has worked every day; he takes the remedy morning\r\nand night; there is no pain or soreness, nor has there been any after\r\nfirst day, only if he sneezes or gets the leg cramped there seems to be\r\nslight contraction of nerve, but the remedy has done most satisfactory\r\nwork in this case and gained a valuable family.\r\n\r\nI hope these few cases may be of some benefit to the readers of the\r\n_Recorder_: 1. Be careful to observe the rule that if remedy should\r\nnauseate cease giving for twelve or twenty-four hours. 2. Always give on\r\nsugar or in tablets. 3. Remove it immediately from room after\r\nadministering. 4. Cover joints to exclude air and keep them warm. 5.\r\nGive any other indicated remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELODERMA HORRIDUS.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The virus, obtained by irritating the animal and allowing\r\nit to bite on glass, is triturated in the usual way.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. T. L. Bradford furnishes us with the following\r\n     classification of this reptile):\r\n\r\nThe heloderma is classed as follows: Order: Saurii. Lacertilia. Lizards.\r\nSub order: 5. Fissilinguia. Family: Lacratidae. Heloderma horridum of\r\nMexico; the crust lizard; the Mexican Caltetopen. Called heloderma from\r\nits skin being studded with nail or tubercle-like heads. The Gila\r\nmonster is a native of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. It is smaller than\r\nthe Mexican variety, and is called, by Cope, Heloderma Suspectum. It is\r\nthe only lizard whose character is not above reproach, hence the name.\r\nZoology says: An esquamate-tongued lizard with clavicles not dilated\r\nproximally, a postorbital arch, no postfront-osquamosal arch, the pre\r\nand post frontals in contact, separating the frontal from the orbit, and\r\nfurrowed teeth receiving the different ducts of highly developed\r\nsalivary glands.\r\n\r\n     (There has been considerable difference of opinion as to\r\n     whether the Heloderma is poisonous or not; but the\r\n     following abstract from a paper on the subject read\r\n     before the College of Physicians, Philadelphia, 1883, by\r\n     S. Wier Mitchell, together with the provings made later,\r\n     ought to very effectually settle all dispute on this\r\n     point; the conclusions are the result of experiments on\r\n     animals):\r\n\r\nThe poison of heloderma causes no local injury. It arrests the heart in\r\ndiastole, the organ afterwards contracts slowly--possibly in rapid rigor\r\nmortis.\r\n\r\nThe cardiac muscle loses its irritability to stimuli at the time it\r\nceases to beat. The other muscles and nerves respond to irritants.\r\n\r\nThe spinal cord has its power annihilated abruptly, and refuses to\r\nrespond to the most powerful electrical currents.\r\n\r\nThis virulent heart poison contrasts strongly with serpent venom, since\r\nthey give rise to local haemorrhages, causing death chiefly through\r\nfailure of respiration and not by the heart unless given in overwhelming\r\ndoses. They lower muscle and nerve reactions, especially those of the\r\nrespiratory apparatus, but do not cause extreme and abrupt loss of\r\nspinal power. They also produce secondary pathological appearances\r\nabsent in heloderma poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe briefest examination of the lizard's anatomy makes it clear why it\r\nhas been with reason suspected to be poisonous, and why it poisons with\r\nso much difficulty. Unless the teeth are entire, the poison abundant,\r\nand the teeth buried in the bitten flesh so as to force it down into\r\ncontact with the ducts where they open at the crown of the teeth, it is\r\nhard to see how even a drop of poison could be forced into the wounds.\r\nYet it is certain that small animals may die from the bite, and this may\r\nbe due to the extraordinary activity of the poison, and to the lizard's\r\nhabit of holding tenaciously to what it bites, so as to allow time for a\r\ncertain amount of absorption.\r\n\r\n     (The provings and the clinical cases that follow were\r\n     from the virus of the Gila monster obtained by Dr.\r\n     Charles D. Belden, of Phoenix, Arizona, in 1890, who\r\n     suggested it as a possible remedy for paralysis agitans\r\n     and locomotor ataxia. He obtained the virus from a\r\n     captive monster by irritating it and then letting it\r\n     strike, or bite, a piece of heavy glass; by this means he\r\n     obtained a few drops of a pasty yellowish fluid. In his\r\n     letters Dr. Belden quotes Sir John Lubbock as follows):\r\n\r\nThis animal does not bite frequently, but when it does it is understood\r\nthat the result is a benumbing paralysis like to paralysis agitans or\r\nto locomotor attaxia. There is no tetanic phase, being, as I apprehend,\r\na condition almost reverse in objective symptoms to hydrocyanic acid or\r\nstrychnia.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Belden also writes):\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that it (the poison) differs in so many points from all\r\npresent known venoms that it is worth our having. In the first place it\r\nis alkaline, and all other poisons of reptiles are acid. Second, its\r\neffect is not always sudden but is lasting--causing sickness for months\r\nand death even after a year. Again, although it does not produce\r\nparalysis it is not the tonic spasm, but rather the slow creeping death\r\nfrom extremities. It does not seem to excite but to depress.\r\n\r\n     (A supply of this poison was sent to Dr. Robert Boocock\r\n     at his request for proving, and he made three different\r\n     trials of it, the results of which were published in the\r\n     _Homoeopathic Recorder_ for March and April, 1893; but\r\n     as Dr. James E. Lilienthal has arranged the matter in\r\n     schema form we will here only give fragmentary quotations\r\n     from Dr. Boocock's papers, which are quite long, covering\r\n     nearly thirty pages. The following is from Dr. Boocock's\r\n     paper):\r\n\r\nI am in my sixtieth year, sanguine, bilious temperament, fair complexion\r\nand weigh 160 pounds; height, 5 feet 6 inches. My normal pulse rate is\r\n72, full, round and regular. I am in very good health. I do not drink\r\nalcoholic beverages of any kind, neither do I smoke nor drink strong\r\ncoffee, or tea, or cocoa. My usual and favorite beverage is hot water\r\nwith a little milk and sugar in it. If much sugar or salt is used my\r\nstomach gets very sour, and water-brash is the result. I therefore use\r\nvery little of either, though I am very fond of sweetmeats.\r\n\r\nWhen I received the first bottle of _Heloderma horridus_, I took a one\r\ndrachm vial and filled it with the 6x trit., and dissolved it in four\r\nounces of diluted alcohol, of which I took a few drops, dried my fingers\r\non my tongue, and a severe feeling of internal coldness, so intense as\r\nto cause me to fear being frozen to death, ensued. I had some twitches\r\nabout my heart, as if the blood was hard to get in or out. I was\r\nsomewhat alarmed, but as I had no trembling I sat over the register and\r\ntried to get warm. The day was a very cold one, but my office was\r\ncomfortably warm, and I had no consciousness of having taken cold.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised at feeling this so soon after taking the few drops,\r\nfor I know that I am very sensitive to any medicine and have a bad habit\r\nof tasting medicine, but never without being conscious of its effects,\r\nsometimes very unpleasantly so.\r\n\r\nNow, to-day is warm and damp, thunderstorm this morning, although it is\r\nDecember 9th. The storm lasted three or more hours; lightning very\r\nvivid. I had already taken one drop of the 30th, with a very severe\r\nnervous headache, but I forgot that when I took the medicine. I have\r\nmedicated 2 oz. No. 35 globules with 30th dilution, and having taken six\r\nglobules as a dose before they were dry.\r\n\r\nA feeling of heat in head and face, some headache over the right\r\neyebrow. Cold feeling in my legs; after two hours a numb feeling around\r\nand down my left thigh; feeling very drowsy, so took a short nap in my\r\nchair. Was awakened suddenly with a jerking in my head. Central part of\r\nfrontal bone so queer as to awaken me.\r\n\r\nWhen my office bell rang it threw me into a startled and trembling\r\ncondition, something new to me. At 5:30 took four globules more.\r\n\r\n8 P.M. The pressure at my heart and in my head and scalp is very great.\r\nA feeling of great heat and some pressure. Not so much burning in my\r\nface, but a feeling on my left cheek as if being pricked with points of\r\nice. A very severe and tired feeling, with coldness of legs and feet. A\r\nslight dryness of my lips, with a tingling feeling and great dryness in\r\nmy throat. Gurgling in the region of the spleen.\r\n\r\n9:30 P.M. The pressure and heat on the top of my head appears like an\r\ninflammation of the meninges. It does not affect my mind; that remains\r\nclear, and I can think and read as well and as long as ever. No more\r\nmedicine. * * *\r\n\r\nDecember 29, 1892. No medicine. Some trembling, but not so great or so\r\nextensive; it does not now extend along the whole limb. Parts of right\r\narm and left thigh hemiplegial; no acute feeling. But some muscles will\r\ntwitch and tremble for a few seconds. Just enough to arrest my attention\r\nand amuse me, and feel like saying, \"Hello, _Heloderma hor_! have you\r\nnot done with me yet?\" For it is a great surprise to me how these\r\nfeelings will come on and creep over me. And I am inclined to ask\r\nmyself, can it be that all these strange and to me new feelings can be\r\nthe effects following the taking of these few doses? And yet, if it were\r\nnecessary, I could swear they were. I have my fears if I will ever be\r\nfree from these nervous trembling spells, and the feeling in my head and\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n     (The foregoing gives the gist of the first trials. The\r\n     third and last now follows. It was made with repeated\r\n     doses of the 30th potency.)\r\n\r\n12 meridian. Sensation as if a cold, freezing wind were blowing upon me\r\nfrom the bend of my knees. Head feeling as if the scalp were being drawn\r\ntight over my skull, and my facial muscles were being drawn very tight\r\nover the bones. A giddiness and a cold pressure from within the skull. A\r\ncold, running chill from superior maxillary down to the chin. Trembling\r\nof limbs. Coldness extending from the knee into the calf of the leg.\r\nPain and pressure within the skull from crown to occiput, and from back\r\nforward over the left eye. A very drowsy feeling. I could sleep if I\r\ngave way to the feeling. * * * *\r\n\r\nJanuary 4, 1893, 7:45 A.M. Took another dose of six globules. Pulse, 72.\r\nTemperature, 97 3.5. A flush of heat in my face. A feeling as if I were\r\nwalking on sponge or as if my feet were swollen. Dull headache. The\r\narctic cold feeling is more in my right arm, elbow joint, and right\r\nthigh and left foot. A great trembling of my arm. It is hard work to\r\nsteady my hand, which holds my book, enough to continue reading or\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nThe feeling of swelling in my feet of walking on sponges sensation\r\ncontinues; a springiness, with a sense of looseness in stepping out,\r\nwhich requires some caution, as if I were not sure of my steps. The\r\ntrembling of my hands is on the increase; feeling of soreness in my\r\nheart, more under left nipple; pain in my back, lumbar region. Some\r\nlittle scalding of urine; flow not so free and full, intermitting\r\nslightly, as if I had some calculus in the bladder which interfered with\r\ncontinuous flow. Stool more free and full.\r\n\r\nEarwax, which had been very dry, now flows from both ears, but is more\r\nfree on the left side. Left nostril sore; ulcerated. Throat sore and\r\ntender to outside touch. * * *\r\n\r\n9 P.M. Very weak feeling, with pain in my heart; same place, under left\r\nnipple. Head aches and arctic rays in various parts of my body. * * *\r\n\r\nJanuary 5, 12 noon. Took twelve more globules. Numb feeling in my head.\r\nA feeling as if I would fall on my right side. A good drive this morning\r\nin the snowstorm; and felt a desire to bear to the right side and could\r\nnot walk straight because of this, and had repeatedly to stop or step to\r\nthe left to get a straight course on the causeway. A good deal of the\r\nsame feeling, but very weak and sleepy; was compelled to lie down, but\r\ndid not sleep, although feeling very drowsy; laid very quiet, as if I\r\nwas in a stupor; the old feeling in various parts of my body, only more\r\nacute; a feeling in various parts as if a needle were being thrust into\r\nmy flesh.\r\n\r\n4:45 P.M. Took thirteen globules. A very stiff neck the most prominent\r\nfeeling. All the previously recorded feelings, only more intensely. I\r\nhave a painful boring feeling in the middle third of left thigh. * * *\r\n\r\n8:30. Flushed, hot feeling in my head and face, but no increase in\r\ncolor; but then I have just come out of the storm.\r\n\r\n9:30. Took twelve globules more and retired to rest; very tired; slept\r\nvery profoundly until 1 A.M., then could not sleep. My back, in the\r\nlumbar muscles, ached so and my left leg that I could not sleep for\r\nhours, and my brain felt as if scalded; an intense burning feeling in\r\nthe meninges, for this did not affect my power to think. This hot\r\nfeeling commenced and spread down my back. An intense pain over left\r\neyebrow, through my left eye to base of brain and down my back. The pain\r\nin the back of my head caused me to bore my head deep into my pillow,\r\nand reminded me of cases I have seen of cerebro-spinal meningitis. An\r\nintense weakness, as if I had no power to move, and no wish to do so,\r\nand yet I was afraid I could not attend to my business. Yet, strange to\r\nsay, I was not alarmed, but passively indifferent. I could not open my\r\neyes without great effort; it was hard work to keep them open and the\r\neasiest thing for them to close, as if there were a great weight upon\r\nthem, keeping them down. I begged to be allowed to remain in bed until\r\nsome one wanted me professionally, and yet I could not thus give way to\r\nmy feelings, and so got up.\r\n\r\n7 A.M. Feeling very weak and giddy. Staggering about my bedroom trying\r\nto dress. It was all that I could do to lift a hod of coal to the stove.\r\nThe pains in my head and lumbar muscles, back of my head near atlas and\r\nmiddle third of left thigh and right elbow are the most noticeable from\r\nthe great pains; and arctic coldness in my feet and hands and arms; have\r\nhad a transient feeling of pain in the little finger and little toe of\r\nright side. Very feverish or parched in the night, and my breathing was\r\nhard and sounded as if I was drawing my breath through iron pipes. I\r\nfeel that I must not take any more medicine at present. When I remember\r\nwhat a long time I was in getting to the end of the previous proving, I\r\nfeel that I dare not go any further.\r\n\r\nThe dose I have been taking, a No. 35 globule, is as large as ten such\r\nas is ordinarily used for the 30th or for high dilutions, so that I have\r\ntaken as good as sixty high dilution globules as a dose, and lately as\r\nhigh as one hundred and twenty-four and sometimes oftener daily.\r\n\r\nI was surprised at these hot flushes and burnings in my head and along\r\nmy spine. And these strongly reminded me of some feeling a proving of\r\n_Gelsemium_ caused, only that has sweat, whilst this has no moisture,\r\neverything being dried up. Saliva, tears, nostrils, and earwax; the\r\ngreat weakness and pain in the body reminds me of cerebro-spinal\r\nmeningitis.\r\n\r\nMy pulse rate is 68. 8:15. Temperature, 97 only.\r\n\r\n1 P.M. What fearful aching in my body! Arctic feeling throughout my\r\nbody, except my head and face, and oh! so tired. A feeling as if it were\r\nalmost impossible to keep my eyes open. While out on my professional\r\nrounds a feeling came over me as if it would be far easier to lie down\r\nin the snowy streets than to keep trying to get along. The trembling is\r\nvery persistent.\r\n\r\n9 P.M. Oh! this bad feeling in my head, the aching, aching in my bones,\r\nin every part of my body, head to feet; no part entirely free from pain,\r\nmy body so cold; a feeling as if I had holes in my garments, and cold,\r\nfrosty winds were blowing through and freezing my flesh; cold penis and\r\ntesticles, no feeling but coldness. A slight gluey discharge; a fluent\r\ndischarge from nose, with great sneezing. * * *\r\n\r\nJanuary 9th, 8 A.M. Pulse rate 68; is not so full or jerky, but it is\r\nsome. Temperature under the tip of the tongue, 96; deeper in, 97. This\r\nmorning awoke at 3 A.M. and got up to urinate, but I could not stand\r\nwithout I had hold of something. Oh, such a weak, giddy feeling! I never\r\nfainted but once, from loss of blood, and these sensations are similar.\r\nPlenty of strength to hold me up, but unable to balance myself, and when\r\nI put forth an effort I staggered about like a man trying to walk with\r\nparalysis or locomotor ataxy. This idea was the most prominent in my\r\nmind, but I have a patient recovering from paralysis who has to swing\r\nhis body as he walks, to get his feet forward, and is very weak and\r\nshaky about his knees, and these sensations very strongly reminded me of\r\nhis efforts. His weakness is in his knees, but mine was from the base of\r\nmy skull--cerebrum--where the pains have been so persistent near the\r\natlas extending downward. When I arose, at 7 A.M., it was very hard work\r\nfor me to balance myself enough to complete dressing myself, and very\r\nhard work to carry my head. If I bent forward, then it required great\r\neffort to keep from falling on my face or backward. This lack of\r\nbalancing power was accompanied by a sensation of nausea, as if I were\r\ngoing to vomit. I persisted in my efforts to work, in hopes of shaking\r\noff these very alarming sensations, and by effort got through my morning\r\nwork. Whilst shaving a severe jerk of my right arm caused me to gash my\r\nface; very strange, but I ought not to have tried to do this. I have now\r\nsome numbness in my right hand and arm, and a good deal of trembling.\r\nArctic feeling in my feet and in various parts of my body. This feeling\r\nof want of balancing power does not entirely leave me; a full, pressing\r\nfeeling in all parts of my head. And when I walk I notice I lift my feet\r\nhigher than usual, or than is necessary, and I put my heel down hard, as\r\nif I was not sure of holding on to the ground. I notice some twitching,\r\nas if my feet would spring up, making me walk as if I had the cock's\r\ngait, as it is described. * * *\r\n\r\n7 A.M., January 10, 1893. Thank God I began this day with more comfort\r\nand more control of myself; my limbs are easier to manage; a little\r\ngiddiness and staggering, and stiff, bruised sensation in my back and\r\nlower limbs. My cervical vertebra is less sore and have little pain; and\r\naltogether feel very much better. My pulse rate is 80 this A.M.; full\r\nand round; no jerks perceptible. Temperature 98 under the tongue, by the\r\nroot. Mercury very slow in rising; had to keep the thermometer in a long\r\ntime. I have a flushed, hot feeling in my face and head; no trembling,\r\nless staggering, and can manage my limbs fairly well. I feel as I dared\r\nnot trifle with myself any further, for I am very weak. A very little\r\nexertion would make me feel very ill. I am feeling like a man who had\r\njust come from under a deadly risk; am very weak and prostrated, with\r\nevery nerve on the jump. Oh, so very weak! A sinking feeling. A parched\r\nthirstiness in my throat and mouth. My tongue is clean; bowels regular;\r\na good deal of flatus, very fetid; pale yellow, greenish urine\r\n(specific gravity 1008), smelling very fetid; same smell as the flatus;\r\nmore like the smell of rotting sweet fruit or vegetables. * * *\r\n\r\nJanuary 14, 1893. Could not get out of bed at my usual time; very severe\r\npain in head and back of neck, going down my back and right leg;\r\ntwitches, with cold, stinging, ice-needle pricks. My right hand is\r\nfeeling as if it were frozen. Pulse rate 64; full, round, but appears to\r\nhave a pendulum motion or twitch. Temperature 96 3-5. Mind clear, but\r\nvery weak in my body, and I can not get warm over a hot register or with\r\nhot fluids. This constant arctic cold is very hard to bear and makes me\r\nthis morning feel as if I had a cake of ice on my back. My hands are\r\nblue with cold and my feet feel like lumps of ice. Headache and\r\ngiddiness; could not keep from trembling while some patients were in my\r\nconsulting room, and had a good deal of difficulty in steadying and\r\ncontrolling my voice; when excited could not get hold of the right words\r\nI wanted and dropped some when speaking, from a want of flexibility or a\r\ncatch in my tongue. Pains in various parts of my body; the same\r\nlocations and character. Quite a rush of business to-day and very\r\nill-fitted to attend to it. My hands and feet blue and aching with cold,\r\neven while I was sitting over a hot register that scorched my boot\r\nleather, yet no feeling of warmth in hands or feet. A good deal of\r\nthrobbing and aching in the upper part of my kidneys, the right one the\r\nsorest. Sharp pains in my bowels, near the caecum; some trembling (when\r\nasleep it awoke me) in my right arm and left leg, with a sharp pain near\r\nthe ankle joint. * * *\r\n\r\nJanuary 20. Awoke this morning in a shivering fit. Trembling, giddiness\r\nand headache, but not very severe. Cold arctic feeling. Pulse 68.\r\nTemperature 97 1-5. My feet, 8 A.M., cold. Severe pain in left testicle,\r\nextending through to the back to anus. Bleed very much from old piles.\r\nAn aching at end of penis, and no sexual desire. A feeling as if the\r\ntesticles were swollen and painful, as in orchitis; this is only a\r\ntransient pain, and comes and goes at infrequent periods, or remittent\r\nin their character. I notice my urine is taking on the greenish-yellow\r\nagain, and my right arm is chilly from the arctic rays. My feet are\r\ncold, and the coldness creeps up higher in my legs. A great deal of\r\narctic feeling in and around my heart. My breath is cold. Headache, but\r\nmind clear. Cold chills run over me in various parts of my body. My\r\nhands tremble very much at times, so that I can not write. Pain in\r\ntesticles and coldness, as if they were frozen. Pass a large quantity of\r\nurine. * *\r\n\r\nJanuary 21. 8 A.M. Did not get up before, owing to the pressure in my\r\nskull, as if it were too full; dropsy or some swelling of my brain;\r\ngiddiness, and a numbness down my left leg, and a jerking upward in both\r\nof them. Some trembling and coldness around my heart, and in my lungs\r\nand down my arms. My feet were very hot in the night until 5 A.M., when\r\nthey became cold, numb and jerky, upwards. My pulse rate is very slow\r\nthis morning, only 56 beats. Temperature is slowly forced up to 98. I\r\nhave a sensation as if my left cheek were swollen, but it is not so.\r\nTrembling very much in my hands.\r\n\r\n2:30 P.M. Have not been warm yet to-day; very intense arctic sensation\r\nin my body and heart and lungs. Slight cough. Numbness in my right arm.\r\nMuch trembling, and a sensation of inward trembling in all parts of my\r\nbody. Generative organs frozen cold, and this coldness extends up my\r\nback. My feet so cold that I have burned my boots, and yet cannot get\r\nthem warm. Coldness extends up to my knees. Stiffness and pain in left\r\nthigh. Cold arctic band round my head, with fulness in skull. Pulse 60.\r\nTemperature 97 4-5. Good appetite. Mentally clear, although very weak;\r\nvery tired and discouraged that these feelings last so long. They seem\r\nto be all beginning over again; worse now than they were a week ago. I\r\nfeel more like giving up and going to bed sick, but I cannot afford to\r\ndo so, so I brace up and resist this temptation to try and find an\r\nantidote for these recurring series of feelings. * * *\r\n\r\nJanuary 23. Slept well until 5 A.M.; then awoke with pains in head and\r\nburning in my feet, with some trembling and stiff feeling in my lungs\r\nand heart, as if they were tied or unable to move. As I lay awake I\r\ncould hear my heart pounding away, but, oh! so slow. Felt very weak and\r\nwanted to stay in bed, but after some hard thinking I got up. 7 A.M.\r\nVery weak; staggered about while dressing. Pains in the base of the\r\nbrain. Pulse 64 and irregular in its beats, some of them failing\r\naltogether to declare themselves only by their absence to respond.\r\nTemperature, after being held under my tongue ten minutes, 97 2-5. Very\r\ncold in my back and over my shoulders; hands and feet are blue with\r\ncold. Itching all over my body, and as if I was bitten with fleas or\r\nbugs were crawling over me. Skin of my hands very rough and cracks are\r\nin them. My ears have a feeling as if wax were running out of them.* * *\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 26, 10 P.M. It has required a mighty effort to keep up this day.\r\nMy pulse 56, slow and irregular; temperature 98. Headache, yet mind\r\nclear; backache. Weakness in all my body; my limbs so weak in walking\r\nthat it was difficult to keep going, and felt as if I could lay down or\r\ndrop down anywhere. What heart failure symptoms are I do not know, but\r\nfear I came very near it and yet I have resisted this feeling, and kept\r\nawake and about. Have felt very ill all the day, and am so now on\r\nretiring, 11 P.M. * * *\r\n\r\nJanuary 29. 9 A.M. Just after breakfast, pulse 68, temperature 99; slept\r\nvery heavy, but dreamed of treating many cases of black diphtheria.\r\nAwoke, slept, dreamed the same dream again, and again the same dream,\r\nthree separate times. How very singular! During these provings, I have\r\ndone this three separate times. Three dreams in one night--the same\r\ndream, the same disease, the same families in my dream. This singularity\r\ncaused me to lay awake wondering what this can mean. I have not any\r\npatients suffering from this disease, and I do not know of any in the\r\ntown, and nothing that I know of to bring this disease to my mind. Awoke\r\nfeeling very stiff and sore. * * *\r\n\r\nJanuary 30. Head pains again, the same old character. Sensation of\r\nswelling in my face and pain in nerves of teeth, molars. Hot feeling.\r\nPulse, 68. Temperature, 99. Very weak, but my mind clear. Much trembling\r\nand the oppression round my heart and chest producing a suffocating\r\nfeeling that makes me afraid, and I must now seek some means to arrest\r\nthis difficulty and give me some relief. I know it looks cowardly to\r\ngive up, but my family compels me to do something to enable me to keep\r\nabout. I cannot do any more; this heart oppression makes me think of\r\nheart failure. Pulse, 56, and temperature 96. Very weak. I hope it will\r\nwear away and this trembling improve. They have been caused by this\r\ndrug, one of the most powerful. I gave up and went to bed very ill. I\r\nhad to keep it from my family, but I was afraid my heart would stop\r\nbeating and had a very restless night. I took acetic acid, as vinegar I\r\nhad in some pickles I thought changed or relieved the first class or\r\neffort of provings and caused me to stop and begin again. I think it did\r\nhelp me. Next day very prostrated but did not take any note of my pulse\r\nor temperature, because I had began to try to find an antidote, and this\r\nvinegar and lemon juice has relieved many of them. I fear sometimes that\r\nthe trembling in my hands may never fully leave me now.\r\n\r\nFebruary 12, 1893. Copying my notes has brought so vividly to my memory\r\nthat I can almost feel the old arctic rays through my body, and the\r\ngiddiness and staggering gait of the _Heloderma hor._ days. I hope that\r\nyou may have many others more courageous than I have been, whose\r\nprovings will compare or improve upon this poor effort of mine.\r\n\r\nCLINICAL.\r\n\r\nThe case of paralysis that I spoke of, whose staggering gait was called\r\nto my mind by my feelings, is now taking _Heloderma_.\r\n\r\nIn the following case, Mrs. Ford, eighty-one years of age, has been my\r\npatient several times during the last four years. She suffered from\r\nerysipelas and dropsy in the legs. In September I was again called in\r\nfor the same old trouble; the usual remedies were effectual. In October\r\nshe caught cold, and had also a bad fall; her symptoms were those of\r\npneumonia, fever, delirium and cough, pain in chest and hard work to\r\nbreathe, blueness of lips, tongue and cheeks, cold extremities and was\r\nvery low in appetite, and appeared to be sinking. Pulse, fifty;\r\ntemperature, ninety, and to all human appearance was rapidly dying; all\r\nsaid so, and I fully believed so, but left _Heloderma horridus_, one\r\npowder in water, and ordered her tongue to be moistened with a feather\r\ndipped in this every half hour. I did not call the next day until\r\nevening. I was waiting to be notified of her death, but no such notice\r\ncoming called to see, and, to my surprise, found everything changed. I\r\nthen gave _Helo. hor._ 200, every four hours, with placebos. All the bad\r\nsymptoms gradually disappeared, breathing became natural, heart gained\r\nstrength, pulse increased to seventy, temperature to ninety-eight and\r\nappetite became better, asking frequently for food. This continued so\r\nlong as she was taking this medicine. She was so well that I ceased to\r\nattend, she having no aches or pains, was eating and sleeping well,\r\nbowels moved regularly and night watching was given up. All who saw the\r\nrecovery were pleasingly surprised, and so was I, and have frequently\r\nasked myself could anything else have done this. _Lachesis_ has changed\r\na slate colored tongue, and has aroused those who appeared to be dying\r\nfor a short time, but to extend the life of one as good as dead for\r\nthirty days is a triumph for the _Helo. hor._\r\n\r\n     (To the foregoing we may add that some have thought that\r\n     the proving was too sensational, but other evidence that\r\n     has not appeared in print leads to the conclusion that it\r\n     is essentially true, and that the proving was made by one\r\n     peculiarly susceptible to the remedy. We know of one\r\n     gentleman who laughed at it and in bravado took a number\r\n     of doses during an afternoon. He felt no immediate\r\n     effects, but during the night awoke with some very\r\n     peculiar feelings that he could attribute to nothing but\r\n     the _Heloderma_, and they were of such a character that\r\n     he refused to take any more. It would be well to use the\r\n     remedy with caution until the practitioner has gauged its\r\n     powers.)\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Charles E. Johnson wrote as follows to Dr. Boocock\r\n     concerning the remedy):\r\n\r\n\"I have had under treatment a case that has been pronounced incurable by\r\nmany physicians. She has had most of the symptoms developed in your\r\nproving, that awful coldness being most pronounced. She has had two\r\ndoses of the 200th. I learn through a neighbor that she is delighted\r\nwith the result of the last medicine. The coldness has nearly\r\ndisappeared, leaving a comfortable glow upon the body. She tells her\r\nneighbors this without having been informed by me what results I\r\nexpected from the medicine.\"\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Erastus E. Case contributed the following detailed\r\n     clinical case to the _Medical Advance_, July, 1897):\r\n\r\nAn auburn haired woman, 55 years of age, had numbness in the feet two\r\nyears ago. It has gradually extended upward until it now includes the\r\nlower part of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nTingling, creeping sensation on the legs as if from insects.\r\n\r\nWorse when lying in bed at night.\r\n\r\nWorse from exposure to cold air.\r\n\r\nWorse from touch; she cannot endure to place her bare feet together.\r\n\r\nLegs insensible to an electric battery.\r\n\r\nLegs wasting away, skin very dry and inelastic.\r\n\r\nAnkles turn easily when trying to walk.\r\n\r\nNumbness of the arms from the hands to the elbows.\r\n\r\nForgetfulness.\r\n\r\nMelancholy with weeping.\r\n\r\nWorse in stormy weather.\r\n\r\nWorse when thinking of her ailments, cheered by company.\r\n\r\nPain in the forehead in the morning, aggravated by turning the eyes.\r\n\r\nTongue dry and cracked in the morning.\r\n\r\nSwallowing difficult.\r\n\r\nEmpty eructations, especially before breakfast.\r\n\r\nEmpty, gone sensation in the stomach.\r\n\r\nDislikes sweet things and worse from taking them.\r\n\r\nSensation of constriction about the whole abdomen.\r\n\r\nConstipation from torpor of the rectum.\r\n\r\nHemorrhoids and itching of the anus.\r\n\r\nBurning in the urethra during and after micturition.\r\n\r\nBurning and dryness of the vagina.\r\n\r\nPalpitation and dyspnoea from slight exertion.\r\n\r\nDrawing sensation in all the extremities.\r\n\r\nYellow skin.\r\n\r\nApril 11, 1895. _Heloderma horridus_ four powders, one every four hours.\r\n\r\nApril 23, 1895.

ORD., Bignoniaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Carroba.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The dried leaves are crushed and macerated in five parts\r\nby weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Of this South American remedy the _Dispensatory_ says it\r\n     is used in Brazil and other South American countries for\r\n     syphilis; sometimes under the name _Carroba_. Its value\r\n     was also asserted in _British Medical Journal_, 1885. The\r\n     following letter from Dr. J. F. Convers, of Bogota, to\r\n     Messrs. Boericke & Tafel, throws some further light on\r\n     its use; the letter is dated November 24, 1888):\r\n\r\n_Dear Gentlemen_: Please to accept the leaves of a tree of the\r\nBignoniacea family, called _Jacaranda gualandai_, that I send you with\r\nthis, because it is very much used by our natives to cure illness of a\r\nsyphilitic character. I have used the mother tincture (5 drops _pro\r\ndosi_), and the 3d dilution of it, in the treatment of blennorrhagia and\r\nchancroids with the greatest success. In my experience I have found that\r\nthis medicine is a complementary and antidote to _Merc. v._\r\n\r\nMr. Jose M. Reyes, who proved the [Greek: theta] and the 2x dilution\r\nduring more than one month three times a day, found the following\r\nresults:\r\n\r\nHEAD.--Vertigo on rising after stooping, with momentary loss of sight,\r\nand sensation of heaviness in the forehead. Weakness of memory and\r\ninability to study.\r\n\r\nEYES.--_Pains and inflammation of the eyes, with redness more marked in\r\nthe left eye. Sensation of sand in both eyes._ Ophthalmia, which begins\r\nin the left eye, with lachrymation and night agglutination of the\r\neyelids. Weakness of sight. Syphilitic-like ophthalmia.\r\n\r\nSTOOL.--Diarrhoea with dark mulberry-colored stools without pain or\r\ntenesmus, but with mucus.\r\n\r\nURINARY AND SEXUAL ORGANS.--Increased secretion of the urine. Pain in\r\nthe penis. _Blennorrhagia_ with a discharge which stains the linen a\r\ndirty yellow color. _Chancroids._\r\n\r\nTHROAT.--Pain and burning of the larynx, when laughing or reading aloud,\r\nand small vesicles in the pharynx.\r\n\r\nBACK.--Weakness of the lumbar region.\r\n\r\nThese are not doubtful symptoms.\r\n\r\nN. B.--This remedy acts on the head at first, afterwards on the\r\nintestines, and on the eyes last.\r\n\r\nPlease try it, and make it known to our colleagues. Should it prove to\r\nbe there as good as here, I assure you it will be a valued remedy.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. J. S. Whittinghill contributed the following,\r\n     _Eclectic Medical Journal_, concerning _Jacaranda_):\r\n\r\nLet me give the results of my experience with _Jacaranda_. I believe it\r\nto be a true specific for certain kinds of rheumatism. Its first trial\r\nwas given a patient suffering as follows: She had had rheumatism for\r\nabout ten years--never became serious. Sometimes she was nearly relieved\r\nfrom it; again lost much rest and sleep from it. Her wrist would become\r\npainful and very weak from ordinary labor. She always suffered very much\r\nin the morning upon any motion, and complained of being stiff. Had to\r\nhave assistance in dressing. Upon sudden motion, sensation in the\r\nmuscles as of tearing and being bruised--even painful upon pressure.\r\n\r\nI gave her different remedies as they seemed to be indicated, with no\r\nresults towards removing the trouble. I thought there could be nothing\r\nlost by trying _Jacaranda_. It met with decided success. She was\r\nentirely relieved of muscular pains in a few days. Had the recurrence of\r\nsome symptoms in about six weeks after; tried _Jacaranda_ again with the\r\nsame decided success. Some eight weeks have elapsed since, with no\r\nrecurrence of muscular pains. I have tried it on three other patients\r\nwith the same peculiar morning stiffness and soreness of muscles. All\r\nwere relieved in a few days. They have no more muscular trouble. So I\r\nput morning soreness and stiffness of muscles as the guide in\r\nprescribing _Jacaranda_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAC CANINUM.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh milk from a bitch is triturated in the usual\r\nway.\r\n\r\n     (The late Dr. Sam. Swan had a proving of this remedy, dog\r\n     milk, in the Materia Medica he attempted to publish, but\r\n     of which only one volume appeared. The work is now very\r\n     rare. The following clinical cases were contributed by\r\n     Dr. Philip Rice to the _Medical Century_, Vol. IX, No.\r\n     24):\r\n\r\n_Lac caninum_ is a remedy of undoubted value, though not very thoroughly\r\nunderstood and consequently not very extensively used in this dread\r\ndisease. And since a proving has never been made, and since we have to\r\ndepend entirely upon clinical reports I feel it my duty to report a few\r\ncases in which a clear demonstration of the value of this remedy was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nCASE I.--Bruce McG., aet. 15, dark hair, gray eyes, spare habit, rigid\r\nfibre, nervous, quick, active, called at my office in the evening\r\ncomplaining of sore throat, worse on right side, and on swallowing.\r\nHeadache dull and heavy, slight fever. Inspection revealed tonsils and\r\nfauces congested and angry looking. On right tonsil a patch of membrane\r\nthe size of a split pea was seen.\r\n\r\n_Lycopodium_ 30x was given. The next morning the entire trouble seemed\r\nto have gone to the left side; with it had come, also, stiff neck and\r\ntongue; profuse flow of saliva; temperature 101 F. Membrane somewhat\r\nlarger. _Mercurius ruber_ 30x was given. In the evening the trouble was\r\nworse again on right side, the membrane now entirely covering both\r\ntonsils, temperature 102 F. Limbs ached, back ached, and patient was\r\nrestless. Remembering the symptom, \"membrane alternates between right\r\nand left sides,\" and this having been so characteristic, I gave _Lac\r\ncaninum_ in the 30th potency. Improvement began immediately and at the\r\nend of the third day the membrane was entirely gone and case discharged\r\nas far as medicine was concerned.\r\n\r\nCASE II.--Louisa McG., aet. 13, in temperament exactly like her brother,\r\nthe preceding case. Was irritable and listless for two days, but owing\r\nto the fact that the fair began in a few days, to which she was\r\ndetermined to go, she did not complain. The third day, however, her\r\nmother noticed that she was truly sick and, there being a number of\r\ncases of diphtheria in town, looked into her throat. She found both\r\ntonsils covered with a membrane. I was called and as no other symptoms\r\ncould be elicited I gave _Sulphur_ 30x and told them I would call again\r\nin the evening, which I did and found symptoms rapidly developing.\r\nAching in all the limbs; headache; pain in the throat on swallowing;\r\nworse on the right side; neck and tongue stiff; membrane just the same.\r\nTemperature 101.5; same remedy continued.\r\n\r\nNext morning the membrane was the same, pain now in left side, throat\r\ninternally and externally oedematous, fauces and uvula glossy or\r\nvarnished in appearance. Temperature 102, urine scanty, no thirst.\r\n_Apis_ 30x was now given. In the evening pain back in right side again.\r\nTemperature 102.5. Membrane spreading; stiffness of neck and tongue more\r\nmarked and saliva profuse. Not having seen the case till the membrane\r\nhad quite generally formed, but the patient being in temperament like\r\nher brother and the pain shifting from side to side, as in his case, I\r\ndecided to give her _Lac caninum_. Improvement began immediately and at\r\nthe end of four days the membrane was entirely gone.\r\n\r\nCASE III.--The servant girl in the family where cases one and two had\r\nbeen, Anna B., aet. 17. In temperament the very opposite to the other\r\ncases, being fat, fair and flabby. Complained of pain in right side of\r\nthroat on swallowing, neck stiff, tonsil slightly congested. Felt as if\r\nshe had a bad cold. Advised her to come to the office and get some\r\nmedicine. She had, however, some \"dope\" on hand and said she guessed\r\nshe would take that first. Next evening I was called and found her with\r\nthroat much worse. Membrane covering left tonsil entirely, also a narrow\r\nstrip of membrane on posterior wall of pharynx, pain in left tonsil on\r\nswallowing, neck and tongue stiff, saliva quite profuse. Temperature\r\nonly slightly above normal. _Lac caninum_ 30x was given. Patient never\r\nwent to bed and at the end of the second day no trace of membrane could\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nNow, the symptoms common to all three cases and the only ones\r\ncharacteristic in each case were, first, both pain and membrane shifting\r\nfrom side to side; second, stiffness of neck and tongue; third, profuse\r\nsaliva; fourth, aching in limbs marked; fifth, entire absence of\r\nprostration; sixth, character of pain was \"as if throat was burned raw.\"\r\nNow, the question will arise in the bacteria man's mind, was this real\r\ndiphtheria; were the German's bacteria present? I will answer candidly,\r\nI don't know; I never looked for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPIS ALBUS.\r\n\r\nSYNONYM. Silico-Fluoride of Calcium.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The residue obtained by evaporation, from the waters of\r\nthe mineral springs of Gastein, Germany, is triturated in the usual way.\r\n\r\n     (It was Von Grauvogl who first called attention to this\r\n     drug, the product of certain mineral springs in Germany,\r\n     that have reputation for curing ulcers, cancers, tumors,\r\n     etc. In the Transactions of the American Institute of\r\n     Homoeopathy, 1896, will be found the following by Dr.\r\n     W. A. Dewey):\r\n\r\nMy experience with this remedy, and I have been somewhat interested in\r\nit, dates from about 1876. At that time a member of my own family had an\r\nenlargement of one of the cervical glands. It was nearly as large as a\r\nhen's egg, and had a soft, doughy feel. Under _Lapis albus_ 6,\r\nprescribed, I believe, by Dr. G. E. E. Sparhawk, now of Burlington,\r\nVt., the swelling speedily and completely disappeared. A peculiar and\r\nunusual symptom noticed by this patient while taking the medicine was a\r\nmarked increase in the appetite; it became ravenous.\r\n\r\nSince that time I have used the remedy in many cases of scrofulous\r\nenlargement of the cervical glands, and find that it is almost specific\r\nwhere the glands have a certain amount of elasticity and pliability\r\nabout them, rather than a stony hardness, such as might call for\r\n_Calcarea fluorica_, _Cistus_ or _Carbo animalis_.\r\n\r\nOne case in particular which I recall was a young lady, about twenty\r\nyears of age, a natural blonde, skin fair, bluish white, showing\r\nprominent veins, who had a glandular enlargement in the right\r\nsupra-clavicular region, nearly the size of a goose egg, and one\r\nsomewhat smaller a little farther back in the interval between the\r\nsterno-cleido mastoid and trapezius muscles. These had a certain amount\r\nof hardness, but they were movable. Others of the cervical chain were\r\nalso enlarged, the right side being the only one affected. As the young\r\nlady was engaged to be married, these unsightly lumps were very\r\ndistressing. _Lapis albus_ 6, a powder four times a day, in a week\r\ncaused a marked diminution of the size of the glands, and in three weeks\r\nthey were not noticeable, and eventually entirely disappeared. This\r\npatient also had a ravenous appetite while taking the remedy, an unusual\r\nthing for her. Her anaemic color and complexion were also greatly\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable effect of the use of the remedy I have had was in\r\nthe case of goitre in a lady of about thirty-five, blonde, who had for\r\nover a year noticed a gradual increase in the size of the thyroid gland,\r\nuntil it was as large as a good-sized fist, when she came to me. Both\r\nhalves of the gland seemed to be equally involved. It did not appear to\r\nbe of the encapsulated variety. This patient had received previous\r\nhomoeopathic treatment, having had _Spongia_, _Iodine_, _Thuja_, as\r\nwell as some other remedies. _Lapis albus_ 6 was prescribed, a dose\r\nevery three hours. The swelling began to disappear at once, and\r\ncontinued to diminish in size until it completely disappeared, and at\r\nthe present time over five years have passed with no return of the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATRODECTUS MACTANS.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The spiders are triturated in the usual way.\r\n\r\n     (The following paper by Dr. Samuel A. Jones appeared in\r\n     the _Homoeopathic Recorder_, July, 1889, under the\r\n     title, \"Latrodectus Mactans: a Suggested Remedy in Angina\r\n     Pectoris\"):\r\n\r\n     \"The great result of the grim doctor's labor, so far as\r\n     known to the public, was a certain preparation or extract\r\n     of cobwebs, which, out of a great abundance of material,\r\n     he was able to produce in any desirable quantity, and by\r\n     the administration of which he professed to cure diseases\r\n     of the inflammatory class, and to work very wonderful\r\n     effects upon the human system.\"--_Dr. Grimshawe's\r\n     Secret._\r\n\r\nI do not know that the doctor who is the direct occasion of this paper\r\nwas _grim_, nor do I imagine he ever dreamed of such an application of\r\nhis paper as I purpose to make. I never met him; though he wore the gray\r\nand I the blue during a struggle wherein fate might easily have thrown\r\nus together. It was not until the autumn of '76 that I became aware of\r\nhis existence, and then by a contribution of his to a medical\r\nmagazine--the special copy of which was found amongst the multifarious\r\nwaifs of a bookstall. I could not \"decline the article,\" although I was\r\nthen entering upon a field of labor that would leave little time for\r\nsuch quiet research as the old doctor's paper so powerfully suggested,\r\nso I bought the odd number, and fourteen years later I am making such\r\nuse of it as my sense of its significance enforces.\r\n\r\nIt is due Mr. A. J. Tafel to state that but for his most efficient\r\nservices this paper of mine would never have been written. To his\r\nendeavors, stretching through some years, I owe the identification of\r\nthe remedy, without which I should not have put pen to paper; and having\r\nsecured this, from unimpeachable authority, too, he never rested from\r\nhis labors until he had put in my possession dilutions of the poison\r\nitself. If, then, this _magis venenum_ shall prove itself _magis\r\nremedium_, most assuredly the _pars magna_ of its introduction is his.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Dioscorides and Pliny to the present a venomous quality\r\nhas been ascribed to \"the fluid emitted from the orifice in the fangs of\r\nthe arancidae.\" That this quality was even lethal has been both believed\r\nand questioned. _Insect Life_, Vol. I., No. 7, pp. 204-211, Washington,\r\n1889, contains \"A Contribution to the Literature of Fatal Spider Bites,\"\r\nin which the credulity of mere medical observers and the emphatic\r\nincredulity of professed \"entomologists and arachnologists\" are dwelt\r\nupon, and concerning which its author cautiously concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It will possibly appear to the reader that after collecting this\r\ntestimony we are as far from the solution of the question--'Do spider\r\nbites ever produce fatal results?'--as we were before; but it seems to\r\nus, after analyzing the evidence, that it must at least be admitted that\r\ncertain spiders of the genus Latrodectus have the power to inflict\r\npoisonous bites which may (probably exceptionally and depending upon\r\nexceptional conditions) bring about the death of a human being.\r\nAdmitting in its fullest force the argument that in reported cases the\r\nspider has seldom if ever been seen by a reliable observer to inflict\r\nthe wound, we consider that the fact that species of the Latrodectus,\r\noccurring in such widely distant localities as South Europe, the\r\nSouthern United States, and New Zealand, are uniformly set aside by the\r\nnatives as poisonous species, when there is nothing especially dangerous\r\nin their appearance, is the strongest argument for believing that these\r\nstatements have some verification in fact. It is no wonder that a\r\npopular fear should follow the ferocious-looking spiders of the family\r\nTheraphosoidae; but considering the comparatively small size and modest\r\ncoloring of the species of Latrodectus so wide-spread a prejudice,\r\noccurring in so many distinct localities, must be well founded.\" P. 211.\r\n\r\nIs it indeed an _argument_ that \"in reported cases the spider has seldom\r\nif ever been seen by a reliable observer to inflict the wound?\" How an\r\nOrfila, a Christison, and a Caspar would smile when asked if the\r\nevidence of a poisonous quality depended upon the administration of the\r\npoison being \"seen by a reliable observer.\" Toxicology detects a poison\r\nby the physiological test as well as the chemical. Strychnia in quantity\r\ntoo small for the coarse chemical test is revealed by the tetanized\r\nmuscles of a frog whether that \"arch martyr to science\" be in \"South\r\nEurope, the Southern United States, or New Zealand,\" and that\r\ninfinitesimal fractions of Strychnia will display its characteristics\r\nwhether or not its administration is \"seen\" by a Christison, or a\r\ncollege janitor. Of course, a Christison would recognize Strychnia from\r\nand in the phenomena, while a college janitor (and here and there an\r\nover-scientific entomologist) might not.\r\n\r\nIt is neither the aim nor the purpose of this paper to establish the\r\nlethal property of spider poison; though I must acknowledge that, until\r\nI read the paper in _Insect Life_, I had no thought that its possession\r\nof such a property would be called in question. I shall content myself\r\nwith calling attention to the pathogenetic quality of the poison of\r\n_Latrodectus mactans_, leaving my reader to discern the resemblance of\r\nits _tout ensemble_ to an attack of angina pectoris, and therefore to\r\ninfer its homoeopathic applicability in that dread disorder. I shall\r\nnot enter upon the pathology--various and much confused--of that cardiac\r\nseizure, because, as I get older, I find the \"like\" more and more of a\r\n\"pillar of cloud by day and pillar of fire by night,\" whilst in my short\r\nlife I have found \"pathology\" as changeable as a dying dolphin--and\r\nevery one knows that a dead fish \"stinks and shines, and shines and\r\nstinks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCASES OF SPIDER BITE.\r\n\r\nBY G. WILLIAM SEMPLE, M. D., HAMPTON, VA.[J]\r\n\r\n    [J] _Virginia Medical Monthly_, Vol. II., No. 9, pp. 633-38,\r\n    1875. \"He was commissioned surgeon in the Confederate army,\r\n    July 1, 1861; served until August 1st in the field on the\r\n    peninsula; then placed in charge of hospital in Williamsburg;\r\n    afterwards ordered to Richmond and placed in charge of an\r\n    hospital, and remained until close of war.\" Failing to find\r\n    any further trace of him I am led to believe that he has been\r\n    mustered out of service by the Grand Commander.\r\n\r\n\"Spider bites are of rare occurrence in this vicinity, but are generally\r\nproductive of grave symptoms. [Isn't it bad taste for doctors to use the\r\nwords grave symptoms?] I will report all that have occurred to me in a\r\npractice of forty years:\r\n\r\n\"CASE I. September 4, 1853. I was called to see Mr. D., at Old Point,\r\nwho had been bitten by a small, black spider on the prepuce, whilst on\r\nthe privy seat, at 12:30 o'clock. The bite at first caused only itching\r\nof the prepuce, with a little redness of the part, but in less than half\r\nan hour _nausea_, followed by _severe abdominal pains_, ensued. A\r\nmessenger was dispatched in haste for me to Hampton, three miles off.\r\nBefore I reached the patient, at 2:30 o'clock, _violent praecordial pains\r\nextending to the axilla, and down the_ [left] _arm and forearm to the\r\nfingers_, with _numbness of the extremity_, had succeeded, attended by\r\n_apnaea_.\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of the violence of the symptoms, Dr. Stineca, surgeon of\r\nthe post, had been sent for, who had given two doses of _Laudanum_ of\r\n[Latin: ezh]j each, and two of rectified whiskey of [Latin: ezh]ij each,\r\nand, being in ill health and unable to remain, had ordered his steward\r\nto apply four dry cups over the praecordia. This had just been done when\r\nI arrived. I saw the _blood, thin and florid_, fill the cups like water\r\noozing through the muslin. When the cups were removed, the _blood_,\r\nemptied into a basin, _did not coagulate_; and blood continued to ooze\r\nslightly from the surfaces to which the cups had been applied until the\r\nnext morning, though a solution of _Tannin_ was applied.\r\n\r\n\"I found the patient _suffering extremely from the most violent\r\npraecordial pains and from apnaea_, and also _violent pain in the left_\r\narm, which was almost _paralyzed_. His _pulse_ was 130 _and very\r\nfeeble_, his _skin cold_ as marble, and his _countenance expressive of\r\nthe deep anxiety_ he felt and expressed in words. The laudanum and\r\nwhiskey seemed to have produced no effect--the nausea and abdominal\r\npains having subsided before they were administered. There was no pain,\r\ninflammation, or swelling where the bite was received. Even the itching\r\nof the part had subsided. I gave the patient every half hour for several\r\nhours [Latin: ezh]j of aromatic spirits of ammonia, and as much whiskey\r\nand water as he could be induced to take, and afterwards gave them every\r\nhour; also pediluvia of hot mustard and water, frequently repeated,\r\nuntil the next night.\r\n\r\n\"September 5th, 8 A.M.--The symptoms continued unabated; indeed, the\r\npatient grew worse until 2:30 o'clock, twenty-six hours after he was\r\nbitten, for his _pulse_ had then become _so frequent that it could not\r\nbe counted, and so feeble that it could scarcely be felt_. He then\r\n_vomited black vomit_ copiously--a quart or more. Soon afterwards\r\nreaction set in, his pulse gradually gained force, and became less\r\nfrequent, the pain subsided and the respiration improved. At 8 P.M., the\r\npulse had gained considerable force, and the patient slept until some\r\nminutes after 12; his pulse was pretty full at 1:10; his surface warm\r\nand perspirable, and he felt almost free of pain. After a short interval\r\nhe again fell asleep, and slept quietly until morning, when he\r\nawoke--his respiration healthy, pulse 80, regular and with sufficient\r\nforce, and entirely relieved of pain. He soon afterwards had _two pretty\r\ncopious evacuations from the bowels_, similar to the black vomit he had\r\nvomited. After this he said he felt quite well, and took a light\r\nbreakfast and dinner, and returned that evening to his residence in\r\nPortsmouth, and in a few days went to work at his trade.\r\n\r\n\"In thirty-six hours from the time he was bitten, he took three and a\r\nhalf quart bottles of the best rectified whiskey--about three quarts\r\nwithout showing the least symptom of intoxication.\"\r\n\r\nI have cited this case at full length in order to present the _evolution\r\nof the symptoms_, on which alone depends the resemblance of the action\r\nof the poison to the chief symptoms of an attack of angina pectoris--a\r\ncloser resemblance than half a lifetime of somewhat wide reading has\r\nenabled me to find in the effect of any other noxious agent. In fact,\r\nafter much searching, I find this case to be unique. In other cases of\r\nspider bite I can find evidence that assures me of its genuineness, but,\r\nto my knowledge, its _order of symptom evolution_ is as solitary as it\r\nis singular and significant. This feature of _uniqueness_ will cause\r\nmany to regard it with suspicion. I think they will do wrong; for some\r\nexperience in proving work has taught me that one positive result from a\r\ndrug out-weighs any number of negative.\r\n\r\nIn the case of _Latrodectus mactans_ we shall find, from other\r\npoisonings, that, as a rule, it displays an affinity for the praecordial\r\nregion as the _locus_ of its chief attack; and having assurance of that\r\nfact, we shall not find it difficult to accept a clue from even a\r\nsolitary instance.\r\n\r\nOf the remaining cases in Dr. Semple's paper I shall cite only the\r\nsymptoms, and be it observed that in all the cases as here given the\r\nitalics are my own.\r\n\r\nCASE 2. A man \"was bitten in the groin, and complained of only a slight\r\nprickling and itching at the spot where he was bitten, but was\r\ncomplaining [when Dr. S. saw him] of _severe abdominal pain_, with\r\n_nausea_, and a _sinking sensation at the epigastrium_; and his _pulse_,\r\nin a few minutes after the bite, had already become _quick and thready_;\r\nand the _skin very cold_.\" The man soon recovered under ammonia and\r\nwhiskey--two quarts of the latter produced no symptoms of intoxication.\r\n\r\nCASE III. A lad of eighteen years of age. \"There was no pain, but only\r\nitching and redness at the part bitten at first; but _violent pain soon\r\ncommenced there_ [on the back of the left hand] _and extended in a short\r\ntime up the forearm and arm to the shoulder and thence to the praecordial\r\nregion_.\"\r\n\r\nCASE IV. \"A tawny woman [daughter of a quadroon mulatto woman] about\r\ntwenty-two years old, the mother of two children.\" \"Found her\r\n_apparently moribund_; her _skin_ as _cold_ as marble; _violent pain\r\nextending from the bite on the right wrist up the forearm and arm to the\r\nshoulder, and thence up the neck to the back of the head on the right\r\nside_; more _violent pain in the praecordia_, _extending thence to the\r\nshoulder and axilla on the left, and down the arm and forearm to the\r\nends of the fingers_, and _this extremity partially paralysed_; added to\r\nthis, _apnaea was extreme; the respiration only occasional--gasping_; the\r\n_pulse could not be felt in the left radial_, and I was not sure that I\r\nfelt it in the right.\"\r\n\r\nIn about fifteen minutes after the intra-venous injection of 13 minims\r\nof undiluted _Aqua Ammoniae_, the doctor \"was astonished at the calm and\r\npainless expression of her _countenance_, so lately _expressive of\r\nanxiety and pain_.\"\r\n\r\nCASE V. A healthy young girl of 13. She felt a stinging sensation on the\r\n[right] wrist, accompanied by itching and redness at the spot [bitten].\r\nFor several minutes there was but little pain, but in half an hour a\r\n_painful sensation_ began to be felt at the spot, which quickly\r\n_extended up the arm to the shoulder_, and, in the course of an hour,\r\n_along the neck to the back of the head_. * * * _Pain in the praecordial\r\nregion, with apnaea_ coming on, I was sent for. When I arrived she was\r\nscreaming fearfully with _pain_, and frequently exclaiming she would\r\n_lose her breath and die_. The _pulse_ had become _thready_ and the\r\n_surface cold_.\r\n\r\nFrom these _data_ the poison of _Latrodectus mactans_ is suggested for\r\ntrial in _angina pectoris_, in that its physiological action presents\r\nthe closest _similimum_ yet found.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to offer a critical examination of the foregoing cases.\r\nIf they are genuine effects of the poison of _Latrodectus mactans_,\r\nthey must afford a _recurrence of corresponding symptoms_. They may\r\ndiffer in _degree_, because the quality of the venom may vary; first,\r\nfrom the season in which the bite occurred (and judging from cases I, IV\r\nand V, the poison of _Latrodectus mactans_ is most virulent in the month\r\nof September), and, secondly, from the more thorough elaboration of the\r\nvenom. It is known that the poison of _Crotalus horridus_ differs in\r\nintensity according to the frequency with which the snake has bitten in\r\na given period of time; of four successive \"strikes\" in four different\r\norganisms, and at brief intervals, the intensity of the action will\r\nvary, so that while the first wound is lethal the last is not--on which\r\nfact depends the vaunted reputation of many an antidote to the bite of\r\nthe rattlesnake. That this may be also true of the spider poison is the\r\nonly explanation I can offer for the fact that many naturalists have\r\nallowed themselves to be bitten by spiders of reputed poisonous species,\r\nand with impunity.\r\n\r\nRECURRENCE OF CORRESPONDING SYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\n              (_Arabic numerals refer to the Cases._)\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------+---------+----------+\r\n  |    I.

I am not ready to believe that drug symptoms\r\nare only the result of a \"fortuitous concourse of atoms,\" nor can I for\r\none moment imagine that they are the product of blind and aimless\r\nchance. I plainly discern in them the result of law, and I am wholly\r\nunable to conceive of existing law without the absolutely necessary\r\n_pre_-existing law maker. The consequent must have its antecedent.\r\nTherefore, in a drug symptom I see a purpose, and by the light of the\r\nlaw of similars I find the purpose of a drug symptom in an analogous\r\ndisease symptom--they answer to each other as face unto face in the\r\nrefiner's silver--and behind and beyond them both is another purpose, of\r\nwisdom inscrutable, of love unfathomable. In a word, my reader, the\r\nproblem of the visible universe forces upon me the alternative that\r\nweighed upon Marcus Aurelius--\"either gods, or atoms.\" With atoms only I\r\ncannot account for law; with God and in God both atoms and law find a\r\nmeaning and a purpose.\r\n\r\nIf I were submitting these convictions, or, if you will, this \"working\r\nhypothesis,\" to a Sir Thomas Browne, or a William Harvey, or a Thomas\r\nSydenham I should feel no momentary hesitation; as it is, I can only\r\nhope that the spirit that filled these worthies is not extinct in days\r\nwhen the \"spiritual colic\" that disordered an imaginary _Robert Elsmere_\r\nis thought to disturb the eternal Verities. I much doubt if they who\r\nmistake an eclipse for an annihilation will get any good from this poor\r\npen of mine.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between the symptoms of angina pectoris and the effects\r\nof the poison of _Latrodectus mactans_ are so striking as to justify the\r\npresentation of a comparison; and it is hoped that physicians of wide\r\nreading will pardon what may seem to them a piece of supererogation for\r\nthe sake of many a humbler practitioner whose opportunities have not\r\nbeen so happy. At the same time, the widest reader must admit that he\r\nhas not found any one authority who has given a complete picture of\r\nangina pectoris. Nor is it essential that such an all-including\r\n\"composite\" shall now be presented; on the contrary, we shall offer only\r\nsalient points substantiated by observers of the highest order.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to start from an authority whose scholarship has never\r\nbeen excelled--_Copland_. Of all our medical writers he may be called\r\nthe _Great Definer_--his readers will know what that means.\r\n\r\n\"_Acute constricting pain at the lower part of the sternum, inclining to\r\nthe left side, and extending to the arm, accompanied with great anxiety,\r\ndifficulty of breathing, tendency to syncope, and feeling of approaching\r\ndissolution._\"\r\n\r\nCopland presents a group of constants, and, for a terse definition, has\r\nwell covered the principal phenomena. As variants he has omitted the\r\npulse and the surface temperature. He errs on the side of dogmatism in\r\ndefining the character of the pain as \"constricting;\" \"aching, burning,\r\nor indescribable,\" and \"generally attended with a sense of\r\nconstriction\" is more in accordance with the actual condition. Of\r\nCopland's seven constants, Case 4 presents an analogue for each in\r\nsymptoms IX., V., III., VIII., XII., and the \"tendency to syncope,\"\r\nwhich is not included in our table because Dr. Semple did not put the\r\nfact in express words. If to this group we add the _thready pulse_ and\r\n_cold skin_, we shall have \"covered\" nine of the most prominent symptoms\r\nof angina pectoris; a pathological \"composite\" with a most striking\r\npathogenetic _similimum_.\r\n\r\nBut all the elements of Copland's group are not of equal importance; two\r\nof them, at least, are pathognomonic. \"The two constituent elements of\r\nthe paroxysm,\" says Latham, are \"the sense of dissolution and the pain.\"\r\n\"Pain with one awful accompaniment may be everything.\" \"This mixture of\r\nthe sharpest pain with a feeling of instant death.\" According to\r\nFothergill \"the two prominent subjective phenomena are pain in the chest\r\nand a sense of impending death.\" Eulenburg and Guttmann include another\r\nelement: \"We regard the substernal pain, the feeling of anxiety, and the\r\ndisturbance of the heart's action, as the essential symptoms of angina\r\npectoris.\" Romberg notes the companionship of these two elements: \"The\r\npatient attacked with angina pectoris is suddenly seized with a pain\r\nunder the sternum in the neighborhood of the heart, accompanied by a\r\nsense of anxiety so intense as to induce a belief in the approach of\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nWe have laid the emphasis of these various citations on the \"essential\r\nsymptoms\" in order to assert, with equal emphasis, that their analogues\r\noccur in not only one case of _Latrodectus mactans_ poisoning. The\r\npraecordial pain is noted in Cases 1, 3, 4 and 5, and the sense of\r\nimpending dissolution in Cases 1, 4 and 5. And that disturbance of the\r\nheart's action which Eulenburg and Guttmann consider an essential\r\nelement is found in Cases 1, 2, 4 and 5; so that the _tout ensemble_\r\npresented by Case 4 is corroborated.\r\n\r\nAnother important element, though it is one subject to variations, is\r\nthe direction of the extension of the pain. It most generally extends to\r\nthe left axilla, and down the arm to the fingers; as variations it\r\nsometimes affects the right axilla and the back of the head. In Cases 1\r\nand 4 the spider poison followed the direction of the disease, and in\r\nCases 4 and 5 it also affected the back of the head. In Case 1 it\r\nproduced the numbness of the arm and hand that is sometimes observed in\r\nthe diseases.\r\n\r\nCopland includes \"difficulty of breathing\" amongst the elements of\r\nangina pectoris. Trousseau does not regard this difficulty as real.\r\n\"Although patients think they are going to be suffocated during a\r\nparoxysm, the chest is normally resonant on percussion, and if it be\r\nauscultated as they draw in breath again vesicular breathing is heard\r\neverywhere.\" Watson says, \"the patient is not necessarily out of breath.\r\nIt is not dyspnoea that oppresses him; for he can, and generally does,\r\nbreathe freely and easily.\" Stokes is decided: \"Respiration is\r\n_secondarily_ affected; there may be slight dyspnoea or orthopnoea,\r\nwith lividity of the face, yet by an effort of the will (if the patient\r\ndares to encounter the pang this commonly produces) the chest may be\r\npretty freely expanded, and the breathing relieved for a brief space;\r\ndyspnoea is not a primary symptom of angina.\" Eulenburg and Guttmann\r\nsay, \"Our own experience leads us to adopt Parry's conclusion, that the\r\nchanges in the respiration are principally, perhaps even solely, due to\r\nthe pain.\" Bristowe speaks of the sufferer as \"fearing to breathe.\" We\r\ncan readily see that the \"apnaea\" observed by Dr. Semple in Cases 1 and 5\r\nhad physical origin, but in Case 4 he says \"apnaea was extreme; the\r\nrespiration only occasional--gasping.\" This shows to what an extreme\r\nextent the action of the spider poison had gone--even to implicating the\r\ndiaphragm; and it is noteworthy that Anstie records a case of angina\r\npectoris (_Neuralgia and its Counterfeits_, p. 67, London, 1871), in\r\nwhich \"there was so marked a catching of the breath as to make it almost\r\ncertain that there was a diaphragmatic spasm.\"\r\n\r\nOf the changes in respiration accompanying angina pectoris we have,\r\nthen, both the general, and the rarest, form, produced pathogenetically\r\nby the poison of _Latrodectus mactans_.\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIn its physiological action the poison of _Latrodectus mactans_\r\nresembles angina pectoris vasomotoria--a purely functional derangement.\r\nThe similitude of the physiological action to pure angina pectoris\r\ncorroborates the accepted pathology of the latter condition, because the\r\nphenomena of _Latrodectus_ poisoning were educed from previously healthy\r\norganisms, and in pure angina pectoris there is no pre-existent organic\r\nchange occasioning the attack. According to the accepted pathology, we\r\nhave in angina pectoris vasomotoria, sudden spasms of the arterioles;\r\nfrom this an increase of the arterial tension; to overcome this is more\r\nforcible and rapid action of the heart; as the arteriole spasm persists\r\nand doubtless deepens in intensity, distension of the left ventricle\r\nfollows, and from overdistension the agonizing breast-pang, and even\r\ndeath from stoppage of the heart's diastole. But we must include another\r\nelement--spasm of the coronary vessels. \"When there is a sudden rise in\r\nthe blood-pressure in the arteries, due to vasomotor spasm of the\r\nperipheral systemic arterioles, and the heart-walls are strong and well\r\nnourished, palpitation is evoked; when the coronary branches are\r\ninvolved in the vasomotor spasm then angina is produced, and the\r\nheart-walls, acutely distended with blood, can scarcely contract in the\r\nface of the opposition presented to their contraction by the high\r\narterial tension. When this sudden systemic arteriole spasm extends to\r\nthe coronary vessels in a heart whose walls are diseased, a fatal attack\r\nof angina with the heart full of blood may be induced. The danger\r\nincreases with the extent of the structural degeneration of the\r\nheart-walls. Sudden rises of blood-pressure in the arteries will tax\r\nhearts in their textural integrity, and lead to painful distension; such\r\nsudden demands on decayed hearts lead to agonizing angina pectoris, and\r\nthe sense of impending dissolution is frequently followed by sudden\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nSpasm of the arterioles and coronary vessels, rise of blood-pressure in\r\nthe arteries, embarrassed action of the heart, and painful distension\r\nare just so many consecutive links in the phenomena produced by the\r\npoison of _Latrodectus mactans_, as Cases I and IV amply testify.\r\n\r\nThe spider poisons are akin to the serpent poisons in their property of\r\nproducing a disorganization of the blood. In Case I, thin and florid\r\nnon-coagulable blood continued to ooze from the cut surface despite the\r\napplication of tannin. It may be a question whether this condition of\r\nthe blood is directly toxicological, or a pathological result of stasis\r\nin the peripheral vessels. I incline to regard it as due to the latter\r\ncondition, and I believe this explanation also holds good in the case of\r\nserpent poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe haemorrhage recorded in Case I was of gastric origin; splenic\r\ncongestion existed, and the vasa brevia--branches of the splenic\r\nartery--gave way under the pressure. I once met a similar haemorrhage in\r\na case of intermittent fever in a child, and I recorded the fact as a\r\npossible hint for the applicability of _Latrodectus mactans_ in a\r\nsimilar condition.\r\n\r\nIn all the year that the stray copy of the old magazine was in my\r\npossession I felt it a duty to write up this remedy. I have done it\r\nlamely, but as well as I was able. Reader, where my duty ends yours\r\nbegins. May you discharge it more worthily than I.\r\n\r\n     (There have been a number of cases reported in which\r\n     _Latrodectus mac._ acted as Dr. Jones predicted; from\r\n     them we select the following by Dr. E. H. Linnell, _North\r\n     American Journal of Homoeopathy_, December, 1890):\r\n\r\nS. L. G., a man fifty years old, of bilious temperament, a dentist by\r\nprofession, had slight attacks of angina after severe exposure and\r\noverexertion during \"the blizzard\" in March, 1888. He did not consider\r\nthem of sufficient importance to consult a physician about them, but\r\nsome months later he had a suppurative prostatitis, which was followed\r\nby considerable prostration, and the attacks of angina became very\r\nsevere. I never could get a satisfactory description of the character of\r\nthe pain, and I never saw him during a paroxysm. The pain was brought on\r\nby exertion of any kind, and was especially frequent soon after dinner.\r\nThe pain was sometimes felt in the left arm, but was usually confined to\r\nthe cardiac region. I once or twice detected a slight aortic obstruction\r\nsound, but aside from this failed to find any evidence of organic\r\ndisease. The usual remedies gave no relief, but _Latrodectus_ [Latin:\r\nezh]c was of great benefit. Under its use the attacks gradually became\r\nless frequent and less severe. He has taken no medicine now for at least\r\nsix months, and he tells me that although he occasionally has a little\r\nreminder of his former trouble, the attacks are so slight that he pays\r\nno attention to them. I have given the remedy in another similar case,\r\nwith even more gratifying success. The attacks were very promptly\r\narrested and have not returned, although nearly a year has elapsed. I\r\nthink we have in this remedy, to which Dr. S. A. Jones directed\r\nattention in one of the issues of the _Homoeopathic Recorder_, a very\r\nvaluable remedy in this painful affection. It is probably, as Dr. Jones\r\nsuggests, in angina pectoris vasomotoria that it will be found\r\nespecially serviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMNA MINOR.\r\n\r\nNAT.

Cooper, of London, and\r\n     appeared in the _Hahnemannian Monthly_, 1894):\r\n\r\n\"The lowest form of phoenogamous vegetation. It consists,\" says\r\nLindley, \"of lenticular floating fronds, composed of stem and leaf\r\ntogether and bearing the flowers in slits in the edge.\" It forms the\r\ngreen scum found on stagnant ponds and dykes. It is found in two\r\nvarieties, the _Lemna minor_ and the _Lemna gibba_.\r\n\r\nBefore going any further I may as well at once make a bald as well as a\r\nbold statement, and say that the special province of _Lemna minor_ is to\r\npitch with vigor upon the nostrils; from the very moment I began\r\nprescribing it this was beyond question evident. I can think of no\r\npossible source of error except that this beneficial action may be due\r\nto the germs adhering to the fronds of the _Lemna_ rather than to the\r\npure plant-force.\r\n\r\nTo guard against this I have carefully filtered my tincture, but this\r\nhas not made the slightest change in its beneficial influence.\r\n\r\nCASE I. Woman aged seventy-four; admission date, September 24, 1892.\r\nNose never clear; breath very unpleasant; for twelve hours nose bled\r\ncontinuously last Christmas; unable to smell properly; hearing for the\r\npast seven or eight weeks bad; watch not heard on contact. Prescribed\r\n_Lemna minor_ [Greek: theta]A. October 1, 1892: Feeling of cold in nose\r\nis better; sense of obstruction nearly gone; can smell better; hears on\r\ncontact on both sides; no medicine. October 22: Decided, though slight\r\nimprovement in hearing; nose, throat and all parts around more\r\ncomfortable. Last attendance.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding with the consideration of the action of this remedy, I\r\nmust consider myself fortunate in having the following case to bring\r\nforward:\r\n\r\n1. A boy of fourteen, whose nose was completely blocked up for the last\r\ntwo years, and whose nostrils were full of polypi, the nose itself being\r\nbroadened, and in whom the nose had been cleared out by operation a year\r\nago at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, was sent to me by my colleague, Dr.\r\nJ. H. Clarke. The boy never remembers having smelt anything, and the\r\npolypi can easily be seen blocking up both nostrils.\r\n\r\nFrom the 26th of November, 1892, to the 4th of March, 1893, four doses\r\nof _Lemna m._ [Greek: theta]A were given at regular intervals without\r\nmuch change, then _Calcarea carbonica_ 200 was given, and two weeks\r\nafter, as he had faceache, _Mercurius_ 3d dec., and on the 8th of April\r\nfollowing the faceache was better but the nose in no way improved.\r\n\r\nThen _Lemna_ was given again, and this time with the most pronounced\r\nrelief; the nose became much clearer, and he went on taking it, and it\r\nalone with scarcely an exception, in fortnightly doses, till the 14th of\r\nMarch last, when his nose was quite clear, with none but a very small\r\npolypi visible; he could breathe freely and his sense of smell had\r\ncompletely returned.\r\n\r\nThe delay in the manifestation of remedial change from November to March\r\narose from complete blockage of the nose, and until the space created by\r\nthe subsidence in the size of the polypi sufficed for a passage of air\r\nthe patient had no reason to acknowledge relief.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment, both of swollen tonsils and in that of nasal polypi,\r\nthe prescriber will be led away at the onset who accepts the testimony\r\nof the patient alone; he should make careful inspection of the parts,\r\nand be guided by what is often but a slight local change, as well as by\r\nconcomitant, and it may be remote, symptoms.\r\n\r\n2. The next case I have to bring forward is one of ozoena in a girl of\r\nsixteen, who had been three years under the treatment of a colleague who\r\nkindly sent her on to me for treatment at the London Homoeopathic\r\nHospital. The girl, whose occupation was a teacher, has had ozoena\r\nsince three or four years old. The odor complained of was horrid, and\r\nthe discharge excessive; a most unpleasant smell in the nose and nasty\r\ntaste in the mouth; she takes cold easily if out in the night air or\r\ndamp, and her nose, at times, gets stuffed up; bowels irregular;\r\ncatamenia only twice--once three months ago and two months before that.\r\n\r\nOn December 30, 1893, I prescribed _Lemna minor_, and she returned to me\r\nfrom the country, where she was living, on the 31st of the following\r\nMarch, imploring me for another powder, as she had been almost well for\r\ntwo weeks after the last and then had relapsed to her old state;\r\nbreathing is short and is low spirited.\r\n\r\n21st of April, very much better; odor not nearly so bad, discharge much\r\nless; unmedicated pilules, three times a day.\r\n\r\n19th of May, 1894, kept better for a month; took cold two weeks ago, and\r\nsince then throat has felt thick and nose has discharged with a horrid\r\nodor. Catamenia regular. Breathing is better; crusts coming from both,\r\nworse on the left side. To have _Lemna minor_.\r\n\r\nThis patient came from a distance which prevented frequent attendance,\r\nbut the above is quite sufficient evidence of the power possessed by\r\n_Lemna m._ in acting upon the nasal mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nIn both these cases relief was immediate after the administration of the\r\ndose, and in neither case could any reasonable doubt exist as to its\r\nbeing drug effect.\r\n\r\nIn some cases I have known a certain disturbance of the bowels to set in\r\nafter a dose of _Lemna_, but this effect of the remedy is not\r\nsufficiently pronounced to be able to say much about it. Still it is\r\ninteresting to narrate one or two experiences, especially as in the\r\nfirst of these, at all events, the concomitants were interesting.\r\n\r\n3. In a married lady, aged about twenty-six, for whom I prescribed\r\n_Lemna m._ [Greek: theta]A on Saturday afternoon, November 12, 1892, and\r\nin whom there existed a good deal of catarrhal pharyngitis, due to high\r\nup post-nasal ulceration, and who suffered from a dry feeling at the top\r\nof the throat with flatulence, and some pain in the bowels toward the\r\nevening, described as \"twisting\" pain, and in whom the nose was blocked\r\non the right side, but without any visible polypus, and in whom the\r\nheart was easily disturbed, causing dyspnoea, the bowels being\r\nslightly confined.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks subsequently she stated that after the dose of _Lemna_ the\r\nnose felt less blocked, and she felt better in every respect; but that\r\non the Tuesday following diarrhoea set in, which began with twisting\r\npains in the bowels and went on to sickness; continual watery stools.\r\nThe least chill or nervousness, I must say, upsets her in this way; and\r\nshe was subject to the same the last two catamenial periods. She still\r\nwakes with her throat dry and tongue coated. _Borax_ 2x was then\r\n(November 25) given without any noticeable effect, and on the 9th of\r\nDecember _Lemna minor_ [Greek: theta]A was again prescribed for the\r\nfollowing symptoms:\r\n\r\nMouth sore after talking or singing, and dry in the morning; tongue\r\ncoated.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of December, reported herself much better; tongue not so\r\ncoated; heart less disturbed; no indigestion or diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nNose not perfectly clear, but no unpleasant smell or taste as she used\r\nto have, and throat no longer dry or uncomfortable. Instead of waking up\r\nwith a dirty mouth, it feels clean and her taste pure.\r\n\r\n4. A man, aged forty-seven, who suffered from old-standing vascular\r\ndeafness and who specially complained of snoring a great deal, was given\r\n_Lemna minor_, and next day a rumbling and disturbance in the bowels set\r\nin and he felt as if he had taken medicine of a searching character.\r\nThis lasted for three days, bowels acting during this time freely with\r\nmuch heat in the passage (anus); but was not bilious, nor were the\r\nmotions diarrhoeic; the snoring went away, and he ceased to dream\r\nunpleasantly when asleep. Hearing, too, seemed somewhat improved.\r\n\r\n5. In another case, after a similar dose, diarrhoea came on next day,\r\nwith pains across the bowels as from flatus; worse after eating, and a\r\nvery putrid taste with an improvement at the same time in a stuffiness\r\nof the nose from which he was suffering.\r\n\r\n6. Crusts form in the right nostril and pain like a string extends from\r\nthe right nostril to the ear of the same side and right ear is deaf. (In\r\na woman, aged twenty-six, great relief.)\r\n\r\nIt is with great pleasure that I have now to bring forward, not my own\r\nobservations, but those of two valued colleagues. Dr. J. H. Clarke sends\r\nme the following:\r\n\r\n_Lemna minor_, CASE I. A lady, aged forty-seven, two years previously\r\nmet with an accident; a sign board fell on her head when out walking in\r\nthe street. Seven days after that was taken with sneezing attacks,\r\nsuffered from nasal catarrh with little intermission until March, 1893,\r\nwhen she came under my care. _Psorinum_ 30 soon put a different\r\ncomplexion on the case, and she became so far relieved of her trouble\r\n(which has made her life almost unbearable, as she never dared make an\r\nappointment for fear of an attack coming on) that she discontinued\r\ntreatment. Last Christmas a sharp attack of influenza brought back the\r\ncatarrh, and this time it proved less amenable to treatment.\r\n\r\nFears of polypus distressed the patient, though I could not discover\r\nany.\r\n\r\nHowever, she again made progress, but scarcely as rapid as I could have\r\nwished, when I thought of giving her _Lemna_ on indications given by Dr.\r\nCooper.\r\n\r\nOn February 15, 1894, I gave it in the 3x, one tablet four times a day.\r\n\r\nFebruary 22, very much better; has felt freer in the head than at any\r\ntime during the last ten years; has felt very much better generally;\r\nspirits braced up.\r\n\r\nShe steadily progressed to cure, and by March 15th could endure the\r\nsmell of strong scented flowers, which before was impossible.\r\n\r\nCASE II. Captain B., aged forty-four, consulted me on February 29, 1894,\r\nfor violent neuralgia on the right side of the neck, the part being\r\nexquisitely sensitive to touch. He had cough and cold for a month. On\r\ngetting up in the morning he filled two pocket handkerchiefs with yellow\r\ndeflusion before he got his nose clear. I gave him _Bell._ 12 to take\r\ntill the neuralgia was better, and then told him to take _Lemna_ 3x gtt.\r\nj. three times a day.\r\n\r\nOn March 9th he reported that the _Bell._ speedily took away the\r\nneuralgia, and that then the _Lemna_ cleared off the catarrh in a most\r\nastonishing fashion. He never had a medicine to act so magically before.\r\n\r\n_30 Clarges street, Piccadilly, W., April 21, 1894._\r\n\r\nThe next communication that I have to bring forward is one from Dr. J.\r\nC. Burnett:\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper told me that he had relieved a case of nasal polypus with\r\n_Lemna minor_, and having several cases of the kind that had long been\r\nunder my observation I thought it my duty to give them the benefit of\r\n_Lemna_.\r\n\r\nCASE I. A gentleman of sixty years of age, with nasal polypus only\r\nmoderately developed, yet of many years' duration, was much troubled by\r\nthe chronic nasal obstruction which was markedly worse in wet weather.\r\n\r\nI gave him _Lemna_ 3x, five drops in water, night and morning. Returning\r\nin a month, he exclaimed: \"That is the best tonic I have ever taken; I\r\nhave never taken any medicine in my life that has done me so much good.\r\nI feel quite comfortable in my nose and can breathe through it quite\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nCASE II. A lady, about forty-five years of age, mother of a large family\r\nand whom I had formerly cured of an uterine tumor, was so troubled with\r\nnasal polypi that her life was very distressful; moreover, the polypi\r\nhad swelled so much that they hung out of the nostrils and compelled the\r\npatient to remain within doors. This was notably the case in wet\r\nweather. Why not have them removed chirurgically?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have had them operated on over and over again, but it's no good;\r\nthey only come again worse than ever.\"\r\n\r\nI have tried many things to cure these polypi, but in vain; they would\r\nget temporarily better, but the first rainy weather brought them back\r\nworse than ever; hence Dr. Cooper's recommendation of _Lemna_ is very\r\nwelcome to me.\r\n\r\nI ordered, as in the last case, with the result that the polypi very\r\ngreatly diminished in size, and the patient could again take her place\r\nin society.\r\n\r\nI have used _Lemna_ in many other similar cases, and with the like\r\nresult. In no case is the polypus really cured, but greatly diminished\r\nin size, and the patient rendered relatively comfortable. Clearly the\r\n_Lemna_ does not either kill, cure or otherwise get rid of the polypi,\r\nbut it rids them of much of their succulence and thus reduces their\r\nvolume, and also diminishes the influence of wet weather to which such\r\npatients are so prone. And this is no small boon; is itself in every way\r\nsuperior to any operative interference. The tincture I made use of was\r\nmade by Dr. Alfred Heath. The first prescription only being of Dr.\r\nCooper's own make. Both acted alike well.\r\n\r\n_86 Wimpole street, June 4, 1894._\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks of Dr. J. H. Clarke and Dr. J. Compton Burnett, as\r\nwell as from my own, I think there can be no doubt, whatever, that the\r\n_Lemna_ exercises a powerful influence upon the Schneiderian mucous\r\nmembrane. How far it is capable by its specific action of removing large\r\ngroups of polypi remains, as yet, an open question.\r\n\r\nMy own experience of the treatment of nasal polypi is that we have very\r\nfew remedies that can at all be depended upon for giving even temporary\r\nrelief. Even from _Calcarea carbonica_ and _Teucrium marum verum_ I have\r\nnot had the effects that some practitioners testify to their possessing.\r\n\r\n_Lemna_ has so far given relief in my hands to cases of nasal polypi and\r\nto cases where the nostrils were plugged by swollen turbinates and other\r\ncauses in a matter far surpassing the effect I have obtained from any\r\nother remedy.\r\n\r\nIn saying this I do not at all wish it to be understood that we have in\r\nit a specific for all such cases.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that the symptoms in all such obscure diseases must be\r\nour guide for the selection of our remedy, and that, therefore, the\r\nimportant point is to work out the specific indications for the drug as\r\nwe learn them from clinical observation, in the hope that on some\r\nfuture occasion pathogenesis may render these still more certain.\r\n\r\nThe indications that I myself have noticed as belonging to _Lemna_ are\r\neither a putrid smell in the nose or a loss of all sense of smell and a\r\nputrid taste in the mouth, especially on rising in the morning, with a\r\ngeneral foulness of the mouth, due apparently to the dropping down of\r\nimpure material from the post-nasal region. Along with this there\r\nsometimes seems to prevail a disposition to \"noisy diarrhoea.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Burnett has noticed that _Lemna_ patients have their nasal symptoms\r\naggravated in damp and rainy weather, and I have to some extent\r\nconfirmed this observation.\r\n\r\nI hope on some future occasion to return to the subject of _Lemna_; it\r\nis in every way well worthy of being prosecuted further.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, a lady patient, aet. fifty-eight, suffering from pains\r\nflitting about her head and legs, with pains in her eyes during heavy\r\nrain, and in whom drowsiness by day and restless sleep at night existed,\r\nhad all these symptoms removed by a single dose of _Lemna_, and the\r\npallid, dullish, sickly look in her face changed to a complexion that\r\nwas natural and healthy.\r\n\r\nThe truth would seem to be that _Lemna's_ symptoms are specially\r\naggravated in heavy rains; _Calendula's_, when heavy clouds are about;\r\n_Rhododendron's_, in thunder storms, and _Dulcamara's_, in damp\r\nsurroundings and in foggy weather.\r\n\r\n     (In 1895 Dr. Thomas L. Shearer contributed the following\r\n     concerning the remedy to the _Homoeopathic Eye, Ear and\r\n     Throat Journal_):\r\n\r\n_Lemna minor_ where the crusts and the muco-purulent discharge are very\r\nabundant with fetor (in rhinitis atrophics). Its action is wonderful,\r\nbut it must not be administered in too low a dilution, as it then\r\nproduces a sensation of intense dryness in the pharynx and the larynx.\r\nPossibly if it were exhibited in a much higher dilution it would be\r\napplicable to cases which have only a slight amount of discharge. It\r\nseems best to stop the remedy as soon as its action upon the secretions\r\nis marked, and then to wait a while before returning to its further\r\nemployment. Dr. Cooper, of London, was, I believe, the first to\r\ninvestigate the action of _Lemna minor_ upon the upper air passages, but\r\nI do not think that he had tried it in cases of atrophic rhinitis. There\r\nis a great future for this new addition to our therapeutic resources,\r\nand it certainly deserves further investigation. It modifies the\r\nsecretions to such an extent that we can more readily improve the\r\ncondition of the nasal chambers with the aid of local measures. Whether\r\nit has the power to prevent or even retard the actual process of atrophy\r\nremains to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEVICO.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Dilutions made from the mineral water or triturations from\r\nthe residue obtained by evaporation of the water.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Burnett has called the attention of the profession\r\n     to this water in his books. The following concerning its\r\n     constituents is from _The Therapist_, a London journal):\r\n\r\nOf all mineral waters those of Levico are distinguished, not only by\r\ntheir contents of these three elements, arsenic, iron and copper, but\r\nthey are remarkable for the state of combination in which they occur.\r\nSituated in South Tyrol, on the confines of Italy, Levico has for many\r\nyears been a favorite sanitorium of the Italian medical profession for\r\ntheir nervous and skin patients. Of late years Levico water has also\r\nbeen increasingly recognized by the German and Austrian faculty, among\r\nwhom Bamberger, Billroth, Hebra, Nussbaum, and others testify to the\r\nextraordinary remedial activity of the waters, favoring assimilation,\r\nincreasing nutrition, and in chronic and dyscratic skin diseases\r\nfunctioning as antiseptic or astringent.\r\n\r\nMerely as an internal medication _Levico_ water has, however, proved so\r\nsatisfactory that it is a recognized member of the pharmacopoeia in\r\nmany German and Austrian hospitals and clinics. Thus Professor Nussbaum,\r\nof Munich, writes that '_Levico_ water is given in my orthopaedic\r\ninstitute in doses of two or three ounces to scrofulous and anaemic\r\nchildren. The water is well tolerated, and in spite of the smallness of\r\nthe dose the result is, in many cases, very evident.' Professor\r\nEulenberg, of Berlin, finds _Levico_ water especially satisfactory in\r\nchorea minor in children and at the age of puberty, as well as for\r\nhysterical neuralgia and spasms. A very copious testimony of like nature\r\nhas been borne respecting _Levico_ water.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATHYRUS SATIVUS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Leguminosae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Wild Vetch. Chick pea.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Trituration of the dried pea.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. W. A. Dewey contributed the following paper\r\n     concerning this remedy to the _Medical Century_, 1899):\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF EFFECTS,\r\n\r\nThe _Lathyrus_ is a vetch, and a member of the leguminosae family growing\r\nin India.\r\n\r\nThis remedy, which produces a perfect picture of certain spinal\r\naffections, has been known for over a century. In _Christison's\r\nToxicology_ it is stated that it causes paraplegia, dragging gait,\r\nturning-in of the toes, stiffness and semi-flexion of the knee-joints.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the homoeopathic profession was directed to the drug\r\nas a possible remedy in paraplegia, in the _British Journal of\r\nHomoeopathy_, Vol. III. Here is found an account of a wheat famine in\r\nIndia, where the peas of the plant were substituted for wheat and used\r\nas a food. Those who subsisted on it were taken, even during sleep,\r\nwith sudden paralysis of the lower limbs; this occurred without\r\nwarning, in young men more than in young women, and was never recovered\r\nfrom. Another observer records fifty cases who had eaten the _Lathyrus_\r\nbread and all stated that they became paralytic during the wet season of\r\nthe country, that they went to bed quite well and awoke with stiff legs,\r\nunsteady gait, and aching, but no severe pain. The upper extremities\r\nwere free.\r\n\r\nAnother who saw the disease in Algeria and described the symptoms found\r\nin ten cases observed that they came on suddenly, in damp weather, with\r\nsome pains in the loins, trembling, motor paralysis and exaggerated\r\nreflexes. He attributed these phenomena to an acute transverse myelitis\r\nwith degenerative changes in the cord.\r\n\r\nA German writer states that the drug produces disturbances of nutrition\r\nof the muscles of the lower extremities, paresis, and that the muscles\r\nof the trunk and neck and face remain unaffected. Sensation remains\r\nnormal. It seems to produce a sclerosis of the pyramidal tracts of the\r\ncord.\r\n\r\nIn animals the same condition is found; namely, paralysis of the hind\r\nlegs. Pigs drag their hind legs and horses give out.\r\n\r\nAGGRAVATED SYMPTOMATOLOGY.\r\n\r\nFrom all the sources which I have been able to find, the following seem\r\nto be the symptoms caused by the drug:\r\n\r\nSudden loss of power in the lower extremities, from the waist down.\r\n\r\nTremulous, tottering gait.\r\n\r\nGreat exaggeration of the reflexes.\r\n\r\nStiffness and lameness of the ankles and knees.\r\n\r\nExcessive rigidity of the legs; flexion difficult; spastic gait, the\r\nlegs becoming interlocked, and walking is difficult or impossible.\r\n\r\nSudden onset of the trouble, and apparent aggravation in cold and damp\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nEmaciation of the gluteal muscles also observed.\r\n\r\nThose having taken it walked on the metatarso-phalangeal articulation,\r\nthe heel not touching the ground.\r\n\r\nImpossible to stand steady; swayed from side to side, but closing the\r\neyes had no effect. This with the exaggerated reflexes would exclude its\r\nuse in locomotor ataxia.\r\n\r\nDebility and tremors of the legs.\r\n\r\nRigidity of the adductors of the thighs.\r\n\r\nStaggering gait, with eyes fixed on the floor.\r\n\r\nCould not extend or cross the legs when sitting.\r\n\r\nSensibility unimpaired.\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDENCE TO SPINAL DISORDERS.\r\n\r\nFrom these symptoms it will be seen that the effects of the drug\r\ncorrespond to many spinal symptoms, but more especially to what is known\r\nas spastic paraplegia. Indeed, Struempel asserts that it produces a\r\nperfect picture of this disease.\r\n\r\nIt is not so often that such a perfect picture of a disease can be had\r\nas in this instance. The disease itself is easily recognized by the\r\nstiff, spastic gait; the spasm of the adductors, causing the knees to\r\nstrike each other, or to become locked, causing the patient to fall; the\r\nshuffling of the feet; the excessive muscular rigidity and the other\r\nwell-known symptoms of paraplegia.\r\n\r\nTherefore, reasoning from our law we would expect the drug to be of\r\nservice in such cases, and although our pathogenesis of it is coarse we\r\nmay be permitted to apply it to a disease whose symptomatology is of the\r\ncoarse order; for it is often difficult to elicit any fine and\r\ncharacteristic symptoms in diseases like ataxic and spastic paraplegia.\r\n\r\nIt has been recognized as a remedy by but few of our writers on nervous\r\ndiseases. O'Connor finds that marked benefit follows its use in old\r\ncases of myelitis with marked spastic symptoms. Bartlett, in _Goodno's\r\nPractice_, recommends it in excessive knee-jerk and rigidity. Hart\r\nspeaks of it as a remedy in locomotor ataxia, but the absence of sensory\r\nsymptoms and the presence of exaggerated reflexes would seem to\r\ncontra-indicate it in this disease. He also speaks of it in spinal\r\nanemia, giving as symptoms: \"Numbness, followed by pain in the lower\r\nextremities; sensation of a band around the body; unable to step or\r\ndistinguish one limb from another\"--symptoms which I am unable to find\r\nthat the remedy produced. Elliott also speaks of it.\r\n\r\nCLINICAL RESUME.\r\n\r\nThe clinical record of _Lathyrus_, though very meagre, gives great hope\r\nthat it may prove useful in numerous cases of bed-ridden paraplegiacs\r\nand in infantile spinal paralysis, as well as in certain forms of\r\nmyelitis.\r\n\r\nThe following is a resume of all that I can find published:\r\n\r\nI. Case of spinal paraplegia, relieved.\r\n\r\nII. A case of multiple sclerosis in a young man of twenty-eight who had\r\nbeen ill seven years and unable to walk for six years was greatly\r\nbenefited by _Lathyrus_ [Latin: ezh]x.\r\n\r\nIII. Case of paraplegia, could walk after taking the remedy for some\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIV. Case of paraplegia, no improvement.\r\n\r\nV. Rheumatic paralysis, with stiff knees, could walk after use of\r\n_Lathyrus_. (Clark _Homoeopathic World_.)\r\n\r\nVI. In a case of a clerk with loss of power of the lower limbs, reflexes\r\nexaggerated, knee-jerk violent, locomotion difficult and unsteady,\r\nprobably a case of transverse myelitis, _Lathyrus_ [Latin: ezh]x, night\r\nand morning, gave most satisfactory results. The patient could walk a\r\nmile without assistance. (Simpson, _Homoeopathic Review_.)\r\n\r\nVII. In a man aged fifty-two who had been unable to walk for six years,\r\nthe paraplegia coming on after a \"stroke\" from exposure to wet,\r\n_Lathyrus_ [Latin: ezh]x practically cured in eight months. He had been\r\ntied to a chair for six, and at the time he stopped treatment he was\r\nwalking four miles daily. (Blake, _Homoeopathic Review_.)\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that the _Lathyrus_ disease occurs frequently in certain\r\nmountainous regions of Asia it has been remarked that it is akin to\r\nBeri-Beri, which has been traced to eating the _Lathyrus_ bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIATRIS SPICATA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Compositae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Dense Button-Snake-root. Gay Feather. Devil's Bit.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The root is pounded to a pulp and macerated in two parts\r\nby weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following, by Dr. T. C. Duncan, was called forth by\r\n     the publication of an item in _Eclectic Medical Journal_,\r\n     stating that twice during the past year _Liatris_ had\r\n     given good results in dropsy; in one case, on the second\r\n     day, the patient had passed a gallon and a half of urine.\r\n     Dr. Duncan's paper was published in the _Homoeopathic\r\n     Recorder_ for 1898):\r\n\r\nAny new remedy that promises relief in dropsy will be hailed with\r\npleasure by the profession. Happening into a pharmacy soon after\r\nreceiving the January _Recorder_, a physician rushed in and inquired for\r\n\"that new remedy for dropsy--that got rid of 'a gallon and a half of\r\nurine in one day.' Have a bad case cardiac dropsy. Want to try it. How\r\ndo you give it?\" He could not get it. \"Get me some,\" was his order.\r\n\"There is the article, be sure to get the right thing, _Liatris_!\"\r\n\r\n_Liatris spicata_ is the familiar \"button-snake-root\" that I used to dig\r\nevery fall for our old family physician (who called himself a \"botanic\r\nphysician\") and who gave it for indigestion. It is also called \"colic\r\nroot\" and \"devil's bit,\" because a piece is missing from each tuber as a\r\nrule, just as if bitten out. _Kost's Medicine_ (my first medical work)\r\ndescribes it as follows: \"Root perennial, tuberous, ovate, abrupt, beset\r\naround the base with many fine fibers; it is aromatic. Stem round, about\r\nthree feet high, bearing a spike of scaly purple-colored blossoms,\r\nbearing in the aggregate a resemblance to an acorn. The leaves are\r\nlinear or sword-shaped, somewhat resembling the leaves of young corn.\r\nIt is found in prairies and open woods in the western States.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Liatris_ is an aromatic stimulant, diaphoretic, diuretic, anodyne\r\nand carminitive. It is particularly useful in colic, backache and\r\nflatulency.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know that it has had clinically a good effect in\r\ndropsy, (1) due to liver and splenic enlargement, also (2) where the\r\nkidneys were involved. In the second case referred to, \"_Apocynum can._,\r\n_Aralia_, _Digitalis_, _et al._\" had been given, but the kidneys failed\r\nto respond until the _Liatris_ \"was given in infusion,\" then \"on the\r\n_second_ day the patient passed _a gallon and a half of urine_\"--equal\r\nto 192 ounces of urine! In the first case the _Liatris_ was followed by\r\n_Ferrum carb_.\r\n\r\nWhether it will prove equally efficient in cardiac dropsy only time will\r\ntell. I hope that the readers of the _Recorder_ will report results,\r\nwhether favorable or otherwise. The dose that Dr. Bradley gave was about\r\na pint, drank during the course of the day, containing about half an\r\nounce of the root. The tincture will be more convenient, and it is a\r\nquestion if the dilutions will not be equally efficient. Try the third,\r\nand then go up or down the scale as the case seems to demand. This drug\r\nshould be proved. It is harmless. If any young physician will volunteer\r\nI will gladly direct him.\r\n\r\nInfusion of _Digitalis_ (English leaves) is a favorite prescription with\r\nsome physicians in cases of cardiac dropsy, but I have not found that\r\nform any more efficient than the dilution, except in cases where alcohol\r\nhad been a cause, then _Strophanthus_ or _Arsenicum_ had a better\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOLIUM TEMULENTUM.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Gramineae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Darnel. (G.) Taumellolch.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Trituration of the dried seeds.\r\n\r\n     (The following concerning this little used drug was\r\n     reported by Dr. Bonino, an Italian physician, translated\r\n     by Dr. Mossa and published in the _Allgemeine Hom.\r\n     Zeitung_, July, 1898. The use of the drug by Dr. Bonino\r\n     was truly homoeopathic for the short proving of it.\r\n     Allen's _Encyclopaedia_ reports trembling of the limbs and\r\n     hand so great that \"he could not hold a glass of water.\")\r\n\r\nA carpenter, aged twenty-nine years, had been suffering ever since his\r\neighteenth year of trembling in both hands, especially in the morning;\r\nof late also his legs began to tremble. It is remarkable that both his\r\nfather and his brother were subject to the same ailment, while no\r\ndefinite cause could be indicated. He was first given _Mercurius vivus_,\r\nthen _Agaricus_, which brought a partial but only transitory\r\nimprovement. Finally I prescribed _Lolium tem._, which in a short time\r\neffected a cure.\r\n\r\n     (On this Dr. Mossa comments as follows):\r\n\r\nThe pathogenetic effects of this remedy which has not yet been proved at\r\nall are only known to some degree from its effects when it has been\r\nmixed with grain and baked into bread. It has caused chest troubles,\r\n_vertigo_ (thence the name darnel-grass, in German _Taumellolch_),\r\n_trembling_, paralysis with anguish and distress, vomiting, failing of\r\nthe memory, blindness, headache, epileptic attacks, deep sleep and\r\ninsanity. The good success obtained by its use in the case given above\r\nshows what curative effects may be expected from it in severe affections\r\nof the brain or spinal marrow. An Italian physician, Fantoni, has tried\r\nit in cephalalgia, meningitis rheumatica and in ischias.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYCOPUS VIRGINICUS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Labiatae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Bugle Weed.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Tincture of the whole plant by macerating one part by\r\nweight of the fresh plant in two parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Although a well-known remedy, the following concerning\r\n     it may not be amiss here; it is from the _Homoeopathic\r\n     World_, 1889, by Dr. Proell):\r\n\r\n_Lycopus Virginicus_ seems to be a specific for bringing back an old\r\n(but long disappeared) haemorrhoidal flux in persons with light eyes. I\r\ngave, a week ago, the first decimal dilution to a gentleman (sixty\r\nyears) for noise and throbbing in the head during the night (which\r\nprevented the quietness of sleep); because neither _Cactus_ (which\r\nhelped quickly when he had blood-spitting) nor _Kalmia_, nor _Gelsemium_\r\nhelped radically. The night after taking _Lycopus_, he was a little\r\nbetter, and in the forenoon came a bleeding from the rectum (about three\r\ntablespoonfuls after defecation) with great general relief. There was\r\nchronic catarrhus bronchialis. Two days afterwards, I gave an elderly\r\nlady (sixty years), who had glycosuria, cataract of the left eye, and\r\nevery third night was very restless, _Lycopus Virginicus_ 1 decimal\r\ndilution, one drop in the evening. The following night was excellent,\r\nand in the morning came an abundant bleeding from the rectum, with great\r\nrelief. Both patients are tall, very irritable, have weak innervation of\r\nthe heart, without decided organic disease of the heart; both are\r\nhypochondriacs; have light eyes; noise in the left ear. Both had, years\r\nago, haemorrhoidal flux, which stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALARIA OFFICINALIS.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--It is prepared in three degrees of strength:\r\n\r\nNo. I. Is the water that stood on decomposed vegetable matter for one\r\nweek at a temperature of 90 deg. F.\r\n\r\nNo. II. Is the water that decomposed vegetable matter for two weeks.\r\n\r\nNo. III. Is the water that decomposed vegetable matter for three weeks.\r\n\r\n     (The following is an abstract of a paper on this peculiar\r\n     remedy, by Dr. G. W. Bowen, that appeared in the\r\n     Transactions of the Indiana Institute of Homoeopathy,\r\n     1895):\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1862 vegetable matter of different forms was decomposed\r\nin my office in glass jars, and malaria was freely generated. Persons\r\nwere hired to inhale the gas evolved in its different stages of\r\ndecomposition, and a careful observation of its effects on them was made\r\nthat gave me a clue to its future use, and the only reliable guide for\r\ncombatting its effect when acquired naturally.\r\n\r\nNot only did the gaseous form demonstrate, but subsequent use of the\r\nliquid product proved it capable of producing not only the three leading\r\ntypes that the past years had made me conversant with, but also others\r\nof a minor grade yet of unsuspected parentage.\r\n\r\n  The miser made delight of added gain,\r\n  Was like a pebble on the shore again,\r\n\r\nIn comparison to the satisfactory consolation that came as a realization\r\nof the comprehension of the producing cause. Henceforth the battle need\r\nnot be carried on mid the gloom of the night.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of the vegetable matter passed through three stages or\r\ndegrees. The first gave off gases freely, yet of not so offensive odor\r\nas later. After ten days or two weeks the expense of securing inhalers\r\nwas more than doubled, even for one moment of time. After three or four\r\nweeks not much gas was generated, for it seemed only capable of lying\r\nstill and sending its fearful odor heavenward. Inhalation of the gases\r\nevolved produced for the first week or ten days a headache, nausea,\r\ndistress in the stomach, coated the tongue white, and this in from one\r\nto two hours time generally; and there, if not carried too far, would\r\ngenerally pass off in two or three days. Inhalations after ten days or\r\ntwo weeks did not produce results in less than twelve or twenty-four\r\nhours, according to time and amount inhaled. Then there was fearful\r\nheadache, nausea, aversion to food, distress through the hypochondriac\r\nregion, first in the spleen, the liver and stomach, and on the third day\r\nchills that would doubtless have continued on indefinitely if not\r\ninterfered with.\r\n\r\nAfter decomposition had gone on for three or four weeks it was ascetic\r\nand simply fetid to a fearful degree, and no results except nausea were\r\napparent in any one exposed to it in less than three or four days. The\r\nfirst was extreme lassitude and loss of appetite, and apparently a\r\ncontinued fever, with an unlimited amount of pains and aches and a\r\nlassitude that limited locomotion.\r\n\r\nThree vials of the watery tincture were saved, one each from the various\r\nstages of decomposition, and from these an attempt was made to make\r\nprovings and find out what were the reliable antidotes to them, and thus\r\nbe able to cope with my invisible foe in my daily avocation. Their\r\nprovings were not carried far enough, or continued long enough to be\r\njustified in placing them in our Materia Medica, but are ample to aid\r\nand guide the future steps that ought to be taken. Its discontinuance\r\nwas rendered rather necessary by my enthusiasm that led too far in a few\r\ncases, but the antidotal effects of certain remedies amply compensated\r\nme for my financial and reputational loss.\r\n\r\nBilious colic, nausea, cramps, diarrhoea and headaches were readily\r\nsecured from a few drops of the first vial, in many cases, while the\r\nsecond vial gave me a large number of cases where the liver, spleen,\r\nstomach and kidneys were apparently seriously involved, and not them\r\nalone, but fair types of intermittent fever with its attendant shakes,\r\nsome daily, some tertian.\r\n\r\nWith the third vial trouble came, as it did reduce many that had been\r\nable to be up and around to their beds, and unmistakably cause them to\r\nget worse, and cause them to degenerate into a typhoidal or\r\nsemi-paralytic condition. In a few cases I was deprived the liberty of\r\nfinding my antidotes and helping them out of the dilemma.\r\n\r\n     (Among the experiments made with these strange tinctures,\r\n     if they may be so called, was the following, which is\r\n     strangely confirmatory of a speculation advanced by\r\n     several old physicians that consumptives are benefited,\r\n     or even cured, by being exposed to malaria):\r\n\r\nIt was a lady, the last of a family of five, all others had died of\r\nconsumption, and three in her preceding generation of the same disease.\r\nI doubted the probability of saving her, yet _theoretically_ decided\r\nthat as the primitive action of malaria was, first, the spleen, next the\r\nliver and stomach, that I would develop an artificial or drug disease\r\nthere, in hopes that her chest would be relieved and doubtless be\r\nbenefited. She was given the tincture from second vial, and on the fifth\r\nday she had a fairly perceptible chill, and a harder one the sixth and\r\nseventh. On the eighth I saw her shake for one hour, and her fever\r\nlasted over six hours. Out of pity my drug was neutralized and her\r\nhealth was restored, with no more cough distress in her lungs or heart.\r\nShe was cured of her tendency and certainty of dying with consumption.\r\nShe remained well for twelve years when she was lost to my call.\r\n\r\n     (In his search for remedies, or antidotes, for the\r\n     malarial poisons, Dr. Bowen was disappointed in\r\n     _Eupatorium perf._ In his experience the following\r\n     remedies are best):\r\n\r\nFor the first or primitive effects, the remedies that did act most\r\npromptly and effectually were _Nux vomica_ and _Bryonia_, thus calling\r\nto mind the effect of those remedies that experience had led me to use\r\nin the attacks that come in the summer, that are usually designated as\r\nof a bilious nature.\r\n\r\nIn the secondary form, or where my malaria seemed to be the result of\r\nthe decomposition of the material or vegetable fiber, its effects were\r\nmore permeating, as different symptoms were developed by it. Then a\r\nchange of remedies (or chemical antidotes, if you please), became\r\nnecessary, and far the best results were secured by the use of _Bryonia_\r\nand _Arsenicum_. _China_ did not act well or give any reasonable\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nPrior and later experience give ample satisfactory proof of the utility\r\nof the use of _Arsenicum_ in all types of an intermittent nature, yet\r\nnot to discredit the fact that other remedies can and will cure this\r\nform. But that a pernicious case can, or will, be as readily restored by\r\nany other remedy, I reserve to myself the liberty to doubt.\r\nOpportunities and time have demonstrated that these two remedies are\r\nable to restore the system and remedy a majority of the diseases that\r\nare wont to make their advent in the early autumn or late in the spring.\r\n\r\nLater, after the total decomposition of my vegetable matter had taken\r\nplace, and it almost seemed to possess a demoniacal potency or power to\r\nundermine the humblest human form, then to my surprise _Bryonia_ seemed\r\nto hold prestige and give splendid results, but needed a different\r\nassistant, one that could and would permeate the muscular system, yet\r\nslowly, and for this _Rhus tox_ was called into requisition, and from\r\nthat day to this it has not been the means of causing me a single\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n     (Again, and as a last quotation from this interesting\r\n     paper, we quote):\r\n\r\nMany years of observation have demonstrated one more important fact in\r\nrelation to the means that will render the system less liable to its\r\nabsorption, at least to that extent that it will give evidence of its\r\npresence, and that is, by the liberal use of coffee.\r\n\r\n     (In 1897 Dr. Bowen sent the following to the\r\n     _Homoeopathic Recorder_ concerning _Malaria off._):\r\n\r\nMessrs. Boericke & Tafel prepared me a new supply of it, and I have used\r\nso far only one form of it and in the one attenuation.\r\n\r\nIt was prepared in three degrees of strength:\r\n\r\nNo. I is the _water_ that stood on decomposed vegetable matter for one\r\nweek at a temperature of 90 degrees.\r\n\r\nNo. II is the _water_ that decomposed vegetable matter for two weeks.\r\n\r\nNo. III is the _water_ that decomposed vegetable matter for _three_\r\nweeks, and it is fearfully offensive.\r\n\r\nI have only used the No. II, or that that had only partially decomposed\r\nthe vegetable fibres.\r\n\r\nIn preparing it for use I put _ten drops_ of the water to ninety drops\r\nof alcohol and then medicated my pellets (No. 30), and it does not\r\nsoften them up. This is the only form I have used it in, and give from\r\nthree to ten of these pills for a dose two, three or four hours apart.\r\n\r\nI have been confined to my home for three months this year, and hence\r\nwill only report a few of the most marked cases.\r\n\r\nCASE I. Mrs. R., aged 45, weighing 245 pounds, could scarcely walk or\r\nget into a buggy for two years, from the effects of rheumatism in her\r\nback and limbs. I gave her last March two drams of No. 30 pills\r\nmedicated with the first decimal, or No. 2 preparation, with orders to\r\ntake ten pills three or four times a day. In _one week_ she could walk\r\nas well as ever and has no rheumatism or lameness since.\r\n\r\nCASE II. Mr. S., foreman in a large saw mill, has been afflicted with\r\nrheumatism for years. He came to me in April with a stiff neck and his\r\nright arm and shoulder helpless and painful. He wished me to keep it\r\nfrom his chest and heart. I gave him two drams No. 30 pellets, first\r\ndecimal, and a vial of _neutral_ globules, with orders to take two hours\r\napart, changing, when better, three hours apart. In three days he was\r\nbetter and could turn his neck and use his arm fairly well. One week\r\nlater gave him two drams more of _Malaria_, to be taken six hours apart.\r\nHe has not had any rheumatic troubles since that time.\r\n\r\nCASE III. Mr. C., proprietor of two large saw mills, one in Arkansas,\r\nwhere he passes part of his time (and frequently gets wet), has been\r\nafflicted with what some doctors called gout. I found it was of a\r\nrheumatic nature (caused from malaria) and made worse by _Quinine_ and\r\nexternal applications. I gave him _Malaria_, two drams, No. 30 pills.\r\nIn three days he assured me he was better and did not have half as many\r\npains or aches. He took only four drachms, at from three to six hours\r\napart, and has not had any rheumatic or gouty pains since. I saw him\r\nlast week and he says he is fully ten years younger than he was last\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nCASE IV. I was called to see I. S., aged 55, a veteran and pensioner of\r\nthe last war. He was poor and bronzed in color. Had not been able to\r\nwalk for years. After repairing his heart, chest, stomach and curing his\r\npiles and regulating his bowels he was content, yet he could not walk.\r\nBeing assured that his back had been injured while in the army, and as\r\nhis limbs would not move at his will and he could not walk alone or get\r\nout of a chair, I gave him for a week _Ruta graveolens_ and _Rhus tox._,\r\nof each the first cent., three hours apart. This enabled him to get up\r\nand down two steps alone to the kitchen. Then, concluding his trouble\r\nwas due to rheumatism, and that was caused by malaria, I gave him two\r\ndrams of No. 30 pellets of No. 2 form of _Malaria_, first decimal, with\r\norders to take ten pills three or four times a day. In one week he rode\r\nto my house and came up and down steps alone. I gave him two drams more\r\nand in five days he came to my office, having walked nearly three miles\r\nthat morning alone. I need not say I was deeply surprised and could\r\nhardly believe it was all due to _Malaria_. It certainly was, as nothing\r\nelse was taken or applied. He has gained flesh and seems to be at least\r\nten years younger than he was.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the surprising results that have been obtained from\r\n_Malaria_ this year. I much wish that others would try it and help to\r\nobtain its proper place as a medicine and healer when used where it\r\nshould be given.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. W. A. Yingling contributed the following to the same\r\n     journal):\r\n\r\nOn the day I received from Boericke & Tafel _Malaria off._ 30, I was\r\nfoolishly led to try Hahnemann's inhalation. The thought just occurred\r\nto me on the spur of the moment, and without stopping to think I took\r\nthree strong inhalations, with both sorrow and a proving resulting. None\r\nof the symptoms were distressing, yet marked and clear cut. The remedy\r\ncommenced its work very promptly and in the order following:\r\n\r\nAching in both elbows.\r\n\r\nA kind of slight concentration of feeling at root of nose, and just\r\nabove, as though I should have a severe cold, similar to that complained\r\nof by hay-fever patients.\r\n\r\nAching in the wrists.\r\n\r\nA tired ache in the hands.\r\n\r\nA tired ache in the knees, and for a distance above and below.\r\n\r\nA feeling as though I should become dizzy.\r\n\r\nPain in top of left instep.\r\n\r\nA tired feeling in wrists.\r\n\r\nAching in an old (cured) bunion on left foot.\r\n\r\nSensation on point of tongue as though a few specks of spice or pepper\r\nwere there.\r\n\r\nItching on right cheek over molar bone; ameliorated by slight rubbing or\r\nscratching.\r\n\r\nWhen leaning face on left hand, elbow on the table, perceptible feeling\r\nof the heart beats through upper body and neck.\r\n\r\nSlight itching on various parts of the face and extremities; ameliorated\r\nby slight rubbing.\r\n\r\nSense of heat in the abdomen.\r\n\r\nChilly sensation in left forearm. Soon followed by chilly feeling in\r\nhands and fingers; feet are cold with sensation as if chilliness was\r\nabout to creep up the legs. A few moments later knees feel cold. A sense\r\nof coldness ascending over body from the legs.\r\n\r\nArms feel tired.\r\n\r\nBelching several times, easy; no taste.\r\n\r\nA drawing pain in right external ear.\r\n\r\nLumbar back feels tired as though it would ache.\r\n\r\nNeck feels tired, with slight cracking in upper part on moving the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nShallow breathing which seems from languor, with a desire to take a deep\r\ninspiration occasionally.\r\n\r\nA kind of tired feeling through abdomen and chest.\r\n\r\nA general sense of weariness.\r\n\r\nA feeling about head as though I would become dizzy.\r\n\r\nPain in upper left teeth.\r\n\r\nA sensation as though I would have a very loose stool (passed away\r\nwithout a stool).\r\n\r\nFeeling rather stupid and sleepy.\r\n\r\nA sensation in the spleen as though it would ache.\r\n\r\nSaliva more profuse than usual; keeps me swallowing often.\r\n\r\nPain in abdomen to right of navel.\r\n\r\nDull aching through forehead.\r\n\r\nFace feels warm as if flushed, also head; becomes general over body, as\r\nif feverish.\r\n\r\nAching across upper sacral region.\r\n\r\nLegs very weary from short walk.\r\n\r\nPain at upper part of right ilium.\r\n\r\nGeneral sense of weariness from a very short walk, especially through\r\npelvis, sacral region and upper thighs. I feel strongly inclined to lie\r\ndown and rest.\r\n\r\nQualmishness at stomach, as though I should become nauseated.\r\n\r\nGeneral sense of malaise and weariness becoming quite marked.\r\n\r\nAching above inner angle of right eye.\r\n\r\nA kind of simmering all through the body.\r\n\r\nFelt impelled to lie down, and on falling to sleep a sense of waving\r\ndizziness passes all over me, preventing sleep.\r\n\r\nAt times I feel as though I should become cold or have a chill, then I\r\nfeel as though I should become feverish or hot, though neither is very\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\nEyes feel heavy and sleepy.\r\n\r\nUneasiness in lower abdomen.\r\n\r\nGaping, yawning and desire to stretch.\r\n\r\nLegs are restless; feel like stretching and moving them.\r\n\r\nI feel very much as I did one time before having the ague, twenty-five\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nOdor from cooking is pleasing, but I have no desire for dinner. Yet when\r\nI sit down I eat a good dinner with relish.\r\n\r\nDizziness on rising from a reclining position.\r\n\r\nFeel generally better after eating dinner.\r\n\r\nAching in the occiput.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon leg weary.\r\n\r\nUnusual hearty appetite for supper (the good appetite keeps with me for\r\nsome days).\r\n\r\nA good night's rest following, and have felt much brighter and generally\r\nbetter ever since the first day. (Healing.)\r\n\r\nI have no doubt had I repeated the inhalations several times I should\r\nhave been very sick. It is not necessary to push a proving to extremes.\r\nI think Hahnemann did not as a rule. If I were strong I should push this\r\nproving, but I dare not. Who will take it up?\r\n\r\n     (Apropos of the foregoing Dr. G. Hering, of England, made\r\n     the following suggestions which hint at a possible use of\r\n     the remedy in tuberculosis):\r\n\r\nWhat curious discoveries are made by the observant! Witness the\r\nfollowing remarks of Dr. Casanova, as recorded in the _Homoeopathic\r\nReview_ of over thirty years ago:\r\n\r\n    \"I know several localities in South America, Africa and\r\n    Spain where the marsh miasma has unquestionably arrested\r\n    and cured that fatal scourge of the human race, phthisis\r\n    pulmonalis, without any other treatment or restriction in\r\n    food or drink. And why should not the climate of the fen\r\n    lands of Lincolnshire, in the neighborhood of Spalding,\r\n    prove as curative an agent for this disease as the climate\r\n    of so many foreign regions where patients go and die,\r\n    deprived of all the comforts of a home? Penzance, among\r\n    the British localities, is reported to be superior to\r\n    nine-tenths of the places to which patients are sent.\r\n    Penzance, then, and Spalding should be particularly\r\n    studied by medical men and recommended to consumptive\r\n    individuals who wish to enjoy the benefits and advantages\r\n    of a national place of relief, if not of cure.\"\r\n\r\nUpon reading this I began to reflect upon the limitless nature of\r\nscience. We never seem to find either beginning or end to it. Circles\r\nwithin circles, and no one can tell what communications there are\r\nbetween those circles. We cannot trace them. We are lost in infinity.\r\n\r\nMiasmatic places are the most healthy places--for some of us at least.\r\n\r\nNow, I think of it, I find I can give some support to this statement of\r\nDr. Casanova. I was once on board a Liverpool steamer which put into\r\nAspinwall, on the swampy Isthmus of Panama, for nine days. Upon our\r\nreturn home several of the sailors, otherwise healthy fellows, were\r\nprostrated by what was called Panama fever, whilst I myself, who had\r\nformerly suffered from tubercular disease of the lungs, was totally\r\nunaffected.\r\n\r\n\r\nMULLEIN OIL.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Fill a bottle with the blossoms from the Verbascum\r\nthapsus, cork tight, and hang in the sun for four or five weeks. By that\r\ntime there will be an oily liquid distilled. Mix with ten per cent. of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. A. M. Cushing introduced this now rather well-known\r\n     remedy to the medical profession in 1884. He writes of it\r\n     as follows):\r\n\r\nThe history of it is this: My father's house was the home for all poor\r\ntramps, as well as ministers, etc. He fell into the river, got water in\r\nhis ears and was quite deaf for months. A blind man called, heard loud\r\nconversation, asked the cause, etc., then said for kindness received he\r\nwould tell us how to make something that would surely cure him, and it\r\nwas worth a thousand dollars in New York city. We made the oil, put it\r\nin his ears at night, and he was well in the morning. For years we kept\r\na bottle of it, and it travelled all around the towns and did wonders.\r\nThat was when I was a youngster. When I studied medicine, or when I was\r\npracticing, I wanted to know if it was homoeopathic, and made a\r\nproving, and developed the symptoms of almost constant but slight\r\ninvoluntary urination, keeping my pants wet.\r\n\r\nI did not make any this past season, and have divided till I have but a\r\nlittle, half-and-half alcohol, left. I could spare a little of that, and\r\nnext season, if I live, will try and make a quantity.\r\n\r\n     (The next item is from a letter of Dr. H. C. Houghton's,\r\n     of New York, addressed to Boericke & Tafel.)\r\n\r\nI have been much interested in the clinical study of this remedy--new,\r\nyet not new--but I have not succeeded in demonstrating what the\r\nsymptom--deafness means in this case. Dr. Cushing does not claim to be\r\nan expert in this department, so time must help us out, and I am anxious\r\nto learn all I can of its effects on the ear.\r\n\r\nIn an old note-book of Dr. Hering's, _Hearing and Ears_, copied for me\r\nwith the author's permission by my friend Dr. C. R. Norton, I noticed\r\nthe following: \"In Germany, flowers of Verbascum thapsus put in a\r\ndark-colored bottle, hung up in the sunlight, give in two or three weeks\r\nan oily fluid which has cured many old people and children.\" This method\r\nis impracticable, the amount produced being so small. Verbascum prepared\r\nin olive oil or fluid petroleum has the same effect as any oil;\r\nexcellent in chronic disease of the integument; negative in middle ear\r\ndisease. When your house brought out _Mullein oil_ under Dr. Cushing's\r\ndirection, I took it up again, and have prescribed it in a large number\r\nof cases. In chronic dermatitis of the external meatus and drum-head, or\r\nexfoliation after furuncle, it is excellent; in chronic catarrhal\r\ninflammation of the tympanum I have not been able to see any effect, but\r\nin chronic suppurative disease of the tympanum, or in accumulations of\r\ndetritus in cases of perforation, scarred drum-heads, etc., it acts to\r\ndislodge accumulations, free the ossicula from pressure, and thereby\r\nimproves the hearing; this process goes on for months till the tympanum\r\nhas thrown out an amount of _debris_ that is surprising. In a few cases\r\nit has caused soreness and increased muco-purulent discharge, due, I\r\nthink, to excessive use.\r\n\r\nMy experience with it in chronic catarrh of the tympanum coincides with\r\nthat of my friend, H. P. Bellows, M. D., of Boston, as published by him,\r\nbut I purpose to continue the study of the drug, and hope for better\r\nresults. In sub-acute or chronic disease after suppuration its effect is\r\nvery gratifying; it aids exfoliation and checks irritation from\r\nexfoliated material.\r\n\r\nI am able to confirm the symptoms noted of its effects in nocturnal\r\nenuresis in many instances. There is one effect I have not seen noticed\r\nby any observers: relief of night cough. More than ten years ago, Dr. H.\r\nA. Tucker, Brooklyn, N. Y., told me of a _Glycerole of Mullein_ made by\r\nmacerating the plant in Jamaica rum for two or three weeks, expressing\r\nit and adding to this product an equal quantity of glycerine. This led\r\nme to the use of the fluid extract of the plant, glycerine and water,\r\nequal parts, as a mollifier in cases where patients would resort to some\r\npopular remedy containing opium or similar opiate. The same effect can\r\nbe produced by drop doses of _Mullein oil_, the teasing cough which\r\ncomes on lying down, preventing the sleep usually yielding to a few\r\ndoses.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. J. C. Wentz contributed the following bit of\r\n     folk-lore):\r\n\r\nThe application of _Mullein oil_ is of more general application than\r\nanything I have found in print. I report to you some cases:\r\n\r\nCASE I.--Mertie B., aged sixteen. Called to see her May 20, 1888. Found\r\nher suffering great pain in right ear. Parotid gland very much enlarged\r\nand painful. The right side of the head and face much swollen. Pulse\r\nabout 100; tongue coated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--_Mullein oil_ in the ear, and used as a liniment twice\r\ndaily on the swollen parts. For the fever, _Aconite_. Great improvement\r\nduring the first twenty-four hours, and on the 23d found the case\r\nconvalescent.\r\n\r\nCASE II.--Carrie H., aged twenty-two. Her second child four weeks old.\r\nCalled November 15, 1888. Right breast inflamed and sore. Two weeks\r\nprevious it had been lanced by another physician, a little above the\r\nnipple, but now a place a little below and to the left of the nipple\r\ngives evidence of forming pus. I told her that in my judgment it had\r\ngone too far to check it then.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--_Mullein oil_, one-half ounce in four ounces of water. Wet\r\ncloths and apply. The inflammation and soreness disappeared in one week,\r\nand by the use of the same remedy occasionally has entirely recovered\r\nwithout breaking. Her husband, when he paid me, said: \"Well you have\r\ndone better than any of the rest of the doctors.\"\r\n\r\nCASE III.--Linford S., aged sixty-four. Called to see him September 20,\r\n1888. Has just recovered from typhoid fever, but is able to be around.\r\nTaken with inflammation of the right testicle. Swollen to the size of a\r\ngoose egg, and much pain. Red and shining appearance of the skin. Cause\r\nunknown, unless it was in connection with chronic enlargement of\r\nprostate gland.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--_Mullein oil_ applied twice daily as a liniment.\r\n_Mercurius sol._ internally. In three days the soreness and pain had\r\nentirely disappeared, but the enlargement continued several days. He\r\nwalked around with ease three or four days before swelling had\r\ndiminished any.\r\n\r\nCASE IV.--F. C., aged thirty. Called November 16, 1888. Found\r\ninflammation of left kidney and of left testicle. Had been under\r\ntreatment by another doctor and had recovered partially, but relapsed.\r\nSuffering much with pain in testicle, which ran up the spermatic cord\r\nand through to the left kidney.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--_Cantharis_ and _Aconite_, as there was some fever.\r\n_Mullein oil_ applied to the testicle. Rapid improvement during the\r\nfirst twenty-four hours, and made a quick recovery.\r\n\r\nI have also cured a case of chronic inflammation of the eyes, and a case\r\nof chilblains from which the patient had suffered, during the winter,\r\nfor about six years. * * *\r\n\r\nEvery drug has its exact range. This one being new to the profession, we\r\nare just learning what it will do. In all these cases the _Mullein oil_\r\nhas had an outward application twice daily.\r\n\r\nA short time ago I was in Dodge city and was talking with a friend about\r\nthe use of various remedies in veterinary practice, and amongst them I\r\nmentioned an almost instant cure of earache in a boy and also the same\r\nin a cat by the use of _Mullein oil_. He said: \"Why do you homoeopaths\r\nuse that? I used to have the well sweep full of bottles of mullein\r\nblossoms when I was a boy. We used the oil as a dressing for burns, and\r\nit was the best thing we could get.\" He also related to me the following\r\ncase, which is of interest and may prove of great value: An old\r\nneighbor, a Mr. Kemmis, had spent a large amount of money treating with\r\nvarious physicians for what they pronounced a rose cancer and without\r\nany relief. An Indian squaw told him to use _Mullein oil_. He distilled\r\nit (as it is now prepared, by sun exposure), and for a short time bathed\r\nthe cancer with the oil. The growth of the cancer was permanently\r\nchecked, but was not healed. Mr. K. lived, perhaps, forty years after\r\nthe treatment was used, and the cancer never again bothered him.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUCUNA URENS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Leguminosae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Horse-eye.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The pulverized bean is macerated in five times its weight\r\nof alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Delgado Palacios, of Venezuela, in 1897, wrote Messrs.\r\n     Boericke & Tafel concerning this remedy):\r\n\r\nReading the list of remedies of your \"Physicians' Price Current,\" I was\r\nvery much astonished to meet with the name _Dolichos pruriens_, which\r\nthe greater and modern authorities in botanical matters consider an\r\nidentical plant with _Mucuna urens_.\r\n\r\nYou will meet the botanical description of _Mucuna urens_ and\r\n_altissima_ (two varieties) in the Flora of West Indian Islands, by A.\r\nH. R. Grisebach, p. 198 (Grisebach regards _Mucuna_ and _Dolichos_ as\r\ntwo different genus).\r\n\r\nIf one consider that there is a discussion upon this subject, and on the\r\nother hand that the mother tincture you possess is that which is made\r\nwith the hair on the epidermis of the pod (_North American Journal of\r\nHomoeopathy, vol. 1, p. 209._ _Allgemeine Homoeopathische Zeitung,\r\nvol. 53, p. 135._ _Oehme, Hale's Amerikanische Heilmittel, p. 242_),\r\nwhile the tincture which we employ is made with the pulverized bean (1:5\r\nalcohol) enclosed in the pod of a special plant which grows in the calid\r\nregions of Venezuela I believe you must try the same tincture we use and\r\nthe success will be that which we obtain.\r\n\r\nI have used my tincture of _Mucuna urens_ extensively in a great number\r\nof haemorrhoids and with the most satisfactory results. It seems that the\r\ncharacteristic symptom or key-note is a sensation of burning. The\r\nhaemorrhoids may be or not in a great stage of development, there may be\r\nmore or less blood, etc.\r\n\r\nOne can consider the _Mucuna urens_ as a specific against the\r\nhaemorrhoidal diathesis. The diseases of other organs, depending upon\r\nthat cause, liver, uterus (haemorrhage) and intestinal affections, yield\r\nadmirably to its use.\r\n\r\nI have been treating recently a remarkable case of chronic ingurgitation\r\nof a testicle, small and frequent haematurias, and other intestinal\r\ntroubles with a prominent symptom, the haemorrhoidal state, which led me\r\nto use _Mucuna_, and in a few months I have obtained a perfect success.\r\n\r\nThe experiences have taught me, and I have the conviction that this\r\ntincture is a more perfect remedy for the cure of haemorrhoids than any\r\nother remedy known. I rely upon it more faithfully than I do upon\r\n_Hamamelis, AEsculus_, etc.\r\n\r\nIts pathogenetics are not known.\r\n\r\nI frequently use the mother tincture in the haemorrhoids, one drop daily.\r\nI seldom use the lower dilutions. _Mucuna_ may be used also, and with\r\nsuccess, as an ointment.\r\n\r\nThe beans are very difficult to obtain; the plant has a single yearly\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPHTHALIN.\r\n\r\nORIGIN--A chemical compound procured from coal, alcohol, ether vapor,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Trituration of the pure naphthalin.\r\n\r\n     (Two clinical cases illustrating the use of _Naphthalin_.\r\n     The first is by Dr. W. L. Hartman, in Transaction of the\r\n     Homoeopathic Medical Society of New York, 1896.)\r\n\r\nIn treating children we are often disappointed in our results; in making\r\nprescriptions we think we have just the right thing in the right place,\r\nbut when we come to see our case again we are confronted with the same\r\ncondition that we had before. We may say the same in adults, but not so\r\noften. In whooping cough in the very young who are unable to tell us how\r\nthey feel we must rely on what the mother may tell us; but how often do\r\nwe find mothers who cannot tell their own symptoms, let alone those of\r\ntheir children? Now, what do we do? Sit and look wise and guess at our\r\nprescriptions while we hear the little fellow coughing, in fact trying\r\nto cough his head off and at the same time lose his breath.\r\n\r\nWell, now while you are thinking and looking wise in this case, just\r\nthink of _Naphthalin_ and give a tablet triturate of the 1x every two\r\nhours, and when you are consulted the next time you will not be annoyed\r\nwith the dreadful choking spell. Now in prescribing this remedy it is\r\nnot necessary to wait until the child chokes to death with the cough,\r\nbut give it from the first and you will be surprised how it will cut the\r\ndisease short. I do not know as I have ever given this remedy without\r\nreceiving benefit, and in many cases it was unnecessary to give any\r\nother remedy to cure the case; if it is, _Drosera_ will follow best.\r\n\r\nThe grand characteristic of this remedy is long and continued paroxysms\r\nof coughing, unable to get a respiration, sometimes so violent as to\r\ncause perspiration.\r\n\r\nThis remedy is not only good in whooping cough, but in any condition\r\nwhere you get the above symptoms _Naphthalin_ will cure your case just\r\nthe same. Now my experience with this remedy where I have prescribed\r\nabove the 1x has been very unsatisfactory, so, of late, I only use the\r\none potency.\r\n\r\n     (The other by Dr. W. A. Weaver in _Hahnemannian Monthly_,\r\n     1898.)\r\n\r\nMy experience with _Naphthalin_ in whooping cough is as yet limited, but\r\nthe results obtained have very much exceeded other remedies and I wish\r\nto cite a few cases in which the alleviation of the symptoms was soon\r\nappreciable.\r\n\r\nCASE I.--Francis----, a boy of 9 months, with a severe bronchitis as a\r\ncomplication. The breathing was labored. The respiratory murmur was\r\nfeeble and a large number of sibilant and sonorous rales were heard,\r\nwhen I was called to see the case. The child had become emaciated, had a\r\ncyanotic appearance, was unable to retain food for any length of time,\r\nbecause of the frequent paroxysms accompanied by vomiting, and was very\r\nmuch exhausted. Later, the moist rales became very prominent over the\r\nentire chest. The paroxysms were of great length, and accompanying was a\r\nfree discharge of thick, tenacious mucus from the nose and mouth. Many\r\nof the favorite remedies employed in this disease were prescribed, but\r\nwith little effect. _Naphthalin_ was then given, four or five drops of\r\nthe tincture in one-half glass of water. In a short time the paroxysms\r\nwere lessened in severity and frequency, the expectoration was freer,\r\nthe number of rales were lessened, and shortly convalescence was well\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nCASE II.--John----, 3-1/2 years, with an accompanying bronchitis.\r\nSymptoms worse at night. Paroxysms very long and severe; would hold his\r\nhead to relieve the pain from coughing. Great difficulty experienced in\r\nbreathing. A number of rales heard over portion of the chest, with\r\nlittle expectoration. After _Naphthalin_ had been given for a short time\r\nimprovement began, and terminated without further complications.\r\n\r\nCASE III.--Patrick----, a man 23 years of age, large physique and\r\nhealthy appearance, contracted pertussis from other members of the\r\nfamily, and, although not accompanied by the whoop, the paroxysms were\r\nvery severe. They were not frequent during the day but many during the\r\nnight. He would wake the entire house by coughing and would become\r\npurple in the face. He had been suffering a week or two before I saw\r\nhim. I prescribed _Drosera_, _Corrallium rub._, _Ipecac_ and\r\n_Hyoscyamus_, without appreciable improvement. He gradually grew worse\r\nuntil _Naphthalin_ 1x in pellets was given. The spasmodic condition was\r\nrelieved very shortly, and although the cough remained for a short time\r\nit never became severe and soon entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARCISSUS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Amaryllidaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Daffodil.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The young buds, stems and leaves are macerated in two\r\ntimes their weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following is from the _Homoeopathic Recorder_ for\r\n     May, 1899):\r\n\r\n\"Agricola,\" one of the _Homoeopathic World's_ oldest contributors,\r\nhas the following to say of this very old, yet little known, remedy.\r\nAfter stating how he prepared it, he continues as follows:\r\n\r\n\"A case of bronchitis (a _continuous_ cough) has from _Narcissus_ 1-3x\r\nobtained such _prompt_ marked relief, where a most varied selection of\r\nthe standard remedies had hitherto failed, as to induce me to write\r\nthese few lines in hope that as this beautiful flower is about to be\r\nfound in most cottage gardens the prevalent bronchitis, whooping and\r\nother coughs may meet with prompt cures. Dr. Charge's work, _Maladies\r\nde la Respiration_, quotes the great Laennec, M. D., as an authority\r\n_in re Narcissus_.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no proving whatever of this drug, although in the\r\n_Encyclopaedia_ (Allen) a case of poisoning from the bulbs eaten as a\r\nsalad is given; but the remedy as prescribed by Agricola was prepared\r\nfrom the young buds, stems and leaves, so the case in the _Encyclopaedia_\r\nis not apropos, nor is the old tincture from the bulbs of use.\r\n\r\nThe name of the plant, _Narcissus_, is not from that of the fabled youth\r\nwho fell in love with his own image reflected in the water, but is from\r\nthe Greek _Narkao_, \"to be numb,\" on account of the narcotic properties\r\nof the drug. The classic Asphodel and the Narcissus are the same, from\r\nwhich it may be seen that the plant dates back as far as man's records\r\ngo. Fernie, in his excellent _Herbal Simples_, from which we gather the\r\npreceding, also says: \"An extract of the bulbs applied to open wounds\r\nhas produced staggering numbness of the whole nervous system and\r\nparalysis of the heart. Socrates called this plant the 'Chaplet of the\r\nInfernal Gods,' because of its narcotic effects.\"\r\n\r\nFernie also says that a decoction of the dried flowers is emetic, and\r\nwhen sweetened will, as an emetic, serve most usefully for relieving the\r\ncongestive bronchial catarrh of children. \"Agricola's\" experience,\r\nquoted above, however, seems to disprove the notion that the beneficial\r\naction in bronchial catarrh is the result of the emetic properties of\r\nthe drug, but demonstrates rather that it is peculiarly homoeopathic\r\nto this malady and long-continued coughs, especially of nervous origin,\r\nas may be inferred from the following, the concluding paragraph in\r\nFernie's section on the _Narcissus_:\r\n\r\n\"The medicinal influence of the Daffodil on the nervous system has led\r\nto giving its flowers and its bulb for hysterical affections, and even\r\nepilepsy, with benefit.\"\r\n\r\nThe _National Dispensatory_ says practically the same, _i. e._, \"The\r\nemetic action of _Narcissus_ has been used to break up intermittent\r\nfever and relieve bronchial catarrh with congestion or obstruction of\r\nthe air tubes. Like _Ipecacuanha_, it has also been prescribed in\r\ndysentery, especially of the epidemic form. Its influence upon the\r\nnervous system, is attested by the vogue it has enjoyed in hysteria,\r\nchorea, whooping cough and even epilepsy.\"\r\n\r\nIt is still the emetic action that is looked to here, but any good\r\nhomoeopath will see beyond that, in Agricola's experience, and\r\nperceive a strong homoeopathic action in the drug to the conditions\r\nnamed, for if it were the emetic action only that is efficacious then,\r\ncertainly, one emetic would do as well as another, but there is\r\nsomething more, and the curative action can be obtained from\r\nhomoeopathic doses without the emetic action. The tincture should not\r\nbe prepared from the bulb, as has been the case in the past, but from\r\nthe fresh buds and leaves. From such a preparation considerable benefit\r\nin obstinate bronchial coughs should be confidently expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGUNDO.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Sapindaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Box Elder. Ash-leaved Maple.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The bark of the root is macerated in twice its weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (In the _California Medical Journal_, 1898, Dr. O. S.\r\n     Laws, of Los Angeles, California, writes of a new \"pile\"\r\n     remedy, _Negundo_):\r\n\r\nI suggested that we have a \"Symposium,\" in Our Journal, on single\r\nremedies. They are the backbone of whatever science there is in\r\ntherapeutics, and should be kept in view. As a starter I offer one that\r\nis entirely new to the medical fraternity, as I cannot find it in any\r\nmedical work.\r\n\r\nIn botanical language it is known as Negundium Americanum. The common\r\nname is \"box elder.\" It is a native of Kansas. It is a distant relative\r\nof the Acer family. I had just fairly begun to test its value when I\r\nleft Kansas for California, and not finding it here, except as a shade\r\ntree on the sidewalks, I cannot get any of the root bark, which is the\r\npart used. From the short experience I had with it I conclude it is the\r\nbest internal remedy we have for hemorrhoids. I have used _Colinsonia_\r\nand _AEsculus_ without ever being impressed with their prompt action. But\r\n_Negundo_ goes at it as _Colocynth_ does in its specialty, so that the\r\nvictim who has been writhing with an engorged rectum \"will arise up and\r\ncall you blessed.\" So you see this is not only a single remedy, but a\r\n\"fundamental\" one. The bark of the root in the yearling plants is what I\r\nprefer.\r\n\r\nRecent cases of hemorrhoids can be completely cured in this way, and the\r\nold hard cases temporarily relieved. So, gentlemen of the medical\r\nprofession, I hereby introduce to you my friend _Negundo_.\r\n\r\n\r\nONOSMODIUM VIRGINIANUM.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Borraginaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, False Cromwell.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The entire plant with root is macerated in twice its\r\nweight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (This paper was prepared by Dr. W. A. Vingling for the\r\n     Kansas State Homoeopathic Society, and reprinted in\r\n     _Homoeopathic Physician_ for July, 1893).\r\n\r\nTo the homoeopathic physician a new remedy, well proven, is an\r\nacquisition of greater importance than honor or wealth, for his sole\r\nduty being to relieve the sufferings of humanity, he acquires a new tool\r\nwith which to accomplish his work. To the degree that the new remedy has\r\npeculiar characteristics its value is enhanced, to the extent that the\r\npathogenetic effects are different from every other drug its usefulness\r\nbecomes the more apparent. Generalities constitute a poor basis upon\r\nwhich to prescribe. Peculiarities, the unusual symptoms, give certainly\r\nan assurance in every prescription.\r\n\r\nWe have in _Onosmodium_ a remedy with some peculiarities, and occupying\r\na sphere unique, a curative range differing from that of every other\r\ndrug. The remedy holds within its grasp the power to restore peace to\r\nthe disrupted family, and to prevent the truant husband seeking the\r\nsweets of \"stolen waters\" by restoring the wife to the enjoyable\r\nperformance of her wifely functions, and thus gratifying the\r\ndissatisfied husband. This generation of one-child families, Malthusian,\r\nwith the long train of misery entailed upon the licensed family,\r\nadultery consequent upon preventive measures, _malum in se_, has its\r\nremedy in _Onosmodium_ to a very large extent.\r\n\r\nWe pass to consider the more important pathogenesis of the remedy in\r\nregular course. A great part of this paper is necessarily based upon the\r\nnotes of the original author, Dr. W. E. Green, with some isolated\r\nsymptoms from the journals and my own experience.\r\n\r\nWe find marked in the mental sphere a DROWSINESS OF MIND and CONFUSION\r\nOF THOUGHT, DULNESS OF INTELLIGENCE, a DAZED feeling of the mind. The\r\nparty wants to think and not move, so absorbed in thought as to forget\r\nall else and where she is. There is a _complete listlessness and apathy_\r\nof the mind; she cannot _concentrate_ her thoughts. From this want of\r\nconcentration there follows an impairment of the memory, _she cannot\r\nremember what is said_. In conversation she will forget the subject,\r\nwill begin a new one, and then suddenly change to another. There is\r\ngreat _confusion of ideas_. This listlessness is so great as to cause\r\nforgetfulness of what one is reading, or that one is reading at all: the\r\nbook drops in vague and listless thought. The time passes too slowly,\r\nand minutes seem like hours. There is great irritability of temper.\r\n\r\nThere is a continuous and ever-present feeling of heaviness of the head.\r\nPAINS IN THE LEFT SIDE OF THE HEAD and _over the left eye_, extending\r\nround the left side to the back of the head and neck, greatly aggravated\r\nby moving or jarring. Intense pain driving her to bed; relieved by\r\nsleep, but soon returning after waking. There is a constant dull\r\nheadache, chiefly centered over the left eye and in the left temple;\r\nalways worse in the dark and when lying down. Here we have a\r\ncontradictory symptom--always worse lying down. The general symptoms are\r\nameliorated by lying down. This peculiar feature is also seen in some of\r\nthe polycrests. _Bryonia alb._ has a \"pain and pressure in the shoulder\r\nwhen at rest.\" _Rhus tox._ has a \"stiff neck, with painful tension when\r\nmoving;\" _Arsenicum alb._ has a headache relieved by cold water.\r\n\r\n_Onosmodium_ has a DULL, HEAVY PAIN IN THE occiput pressing upward WITH\r\nA DIZZY SENSATION. Pain changing from the right frontal eminence to the\r\nleft and remaining there. Darting and throbbing in the left temple. A\r\ndull pain in the mastoid process. She cannot bear to move. A sense of\r\nfullness in the head. Relieved by eating and sleep.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are HEAVY AND DULL; the eyes feel as though one had lost a\r\ngreat deal of sleep. The lids are heavy. The eyeballs have a _dull,\r\nheavy pain with soreness_. A sensation of the eyes being very wide open,\r\nwith a desire to look at distinct objects, it being disagreeable to look\r\nat near objects. Distant objects look very large. _Picric acid_ patients\r\ncan only see clearly at very close range, often at only five inches from\r\nthe eye; _Natrum sulph._ has impairment of vision for distant objects.\r\nWith _Onosmodium_ the ocular muscles feel tense, tired, and drawn. Pains\r\nin and over left eye. Pain in upper portion of left orbit, with a\r\nfeeling of expansion. The vision is impaired and blurred.\r\n\r\nThe hearing is impaired. There is a stuffed-full feeling in the ears as\r\nafter catching cold. Singing in the ears as from quinine, but very\r\nslight.\r\n\r\nThe NOSE FEELS DRY. There is a stuffed feeling in the posterior nares.\r\nThe discharge from the posterior nose is whitish and sticky, producing a\r\nconstant hawking. Constant sneezing in the morning; sneezing when first\r\ngetting up. The bones of the nose pain.\r\n\r\nFlushed face, with relief from headache. That dry feeling of the nose is\r\nalso present in the mouth and lips. Bitter, clammy taste in the mouth.\r\nSaliva is very scant, with the dry feeling in the mouth; cold water\r\nrelieves. Sore throat. It hurts to swallow or speak. That dryness\r\nfollows down the _throat_ and _pharynx_, and is accompanied with _severe\r\nsoreness_. Raw, scraping feeling in the throat. When swallowing the\r\npharynx feels constricted. All the throat symptoms are relieved by cold\r\ndrinks and by eating. The voice is husky. The chest feels sore.\r\n\r\nMorning sickness like that of pregnancy. Distaste for water, yet there\r\nis a _craving for ice water and cold drinks_; _wants to drink often_.\r\nThe abdomen _feels bloated_ and distended, which is relieved by\r\nundressing. The pains in the lower part of the abdomen are also relieved\r\nby undressing or by lying on the back. This amelioration from undressing\r\nis observed to run through all the symptoms of the drug. A constant\r\nfeeling as though diarrhoea would come on.\r\n\r\nThe stools are yellow, mushy, or greenish-yellow, stringy, mushy, with\r\ntenesmus. Also, slimy, bloody, stringy stool, with tenesmus. The provers\r\nwere hurried out of bed in the morning to stool.\r\n\r\nThe urine is scanty, highly colored, dark straw and brown, very acid,\r\nand of high specific gravity. The desire is seldom, or else frequent,\r\nwith scanty flow.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the sexual organs we quote from that racy writer, Dr. S.\r\nA. Jones, who says: \"_Onosmodium Virginianum_ in its primary action\r\nseems directly opposite to _Picric acid_. Perhaps provings of it with\r\nsmaller doses will oblige me to change this _dictum_. If they do not,\r\nthen _Onosmodium_ will occupy the singular position of a remedy that\r\n_primarily depresses the sexual appetite_. If this should ultimately\r\nprove to be the case, it will invest this remedy with an unmistakable\r\nsignificance to physicians who are practicing at the _tail end_ of the\r\nnineteenth century, for, from our habits of life, it is the _end_ that\r\nis showing signs of distress. In estimating the validity of this\r\nsuggestion, the reader will bear in mind Hahnemann's _dictum_ that _only\r\nthe primary symptoms of a drug afford the indications for its\r\ntherapeutical application_. This is a canon of Hahnemannian\r\nHomoeopathy, and it _is true as regards the infinitesimal dose_. Then,\r\nthis being true (for I will not stop to discuss it), _Picric acid_ will\r\nbe indicated for the _initial stage_ of sexual debility and _Onosmodium_\r\nfor the _fully developed consequences_ of sexual abuse; and this,\r\nbecause the said 'initial stage' is characterized by erethism while the\r\nulterior consequences are denoted by atony asthenia. The erethism of\r\nsexual debility is plainly evinced in _Picric acid_, and the ultimate\r\nasthenia is as really discovered in _Onosmodium Virginianum_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the male we find diminished sexual desire. Cold feeling in the glans\r\npenis. Nocturnal emissions. Too speedy emissions. Deficient erections\r\nwith diminished pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn the female we find SEVERE UTERINE PAINS. BEARING-DOWN PAINS IN THE\r\nUTERINE REGION. Uterine cramps. _Soreness in region of uterus_,\r\nincreased by _pressure_ of the hand or of the clothing; had to remove\r\nthe corset. Return of old uterine pains. Dull, heavy aching, and slowly\r\npulsating pains in the ovaries. Pains pass from one ovary to the other\r\nand leave a soreness which remains till the pain returns. Ovarian pains\r\nincreased by pressure. SEXUAL DESIRE COMPLETELY DESTROYED. This symptom\r\nI have verified a number of times, and in every case the parties\r\nprevented conception. The uterine pains are all better when undressed\r\nor lying on the back. Constant feeling as though the menses would\r\nappear. Menses early and profuse, but otherwise normal so far as known.\r\nLeucorrhoea light yellowish, slightly offensive and excoriating;\r\nprofuse, running down the legs. Itching of the vulva aggravated by\r\nscratching and from the leucorrhoeal discharge. Aching in both\r\nbreasts, but worse in the left. Breasts feel swollen and engorged. Left\r\nbreast feels bruised and painful on pressure. Nipples itch. In one case\r\nwhere this remedy was given for dryness of the nose and throat, the\r\ndiminutive almost absent, breasts were restored to their pristine glory,\r\nand resulted in the displacement of the cotton batting pads to the\r\nexceeding joy and delight of the proud woman.\r\n\r\n_Pains in the neck_, running back from the forehead. _Dull aching in the\r\nneck._ Bearing down pain in the lumbar region. Dull, aching pain in the\r\nlumbar region. In the female provers there was produced a pain over the\r\ncrest of the left ilium. TIRED, WEARY AND NUMB FEELING IN THE LEGS AND\r\nPOPLITEAL SPACES. FEELING OF NUMBNESS, MOSTLY BELOW THE KNEES. The legs\r\nfeel as if they were partially anaesthetized. The tendons and joints of\r\nthe knees have a dull, aching pain. Tremulousness of the legs.\r\nDISTURBANCE OF THE GAIT IN WALKING, WITH A SENSE OF INSECURITY IN STEP.\r\nSTAGGERING GAIT, _he cannot keep in the walk_. The sidewalks seem too\r\nhigh; he must step high which jars him and greatly aggravates the\r\nheadache. Dull, heavy pain in the instep of the left foot. Numb,\r\ntingling pain in the outer side of both little toes. THE LEGS FEEL\r\nTIRED, _as though they would not sustain the weight of the body_.\r\nSensation of formication in the calves of the legs. Ankles swollen.\r\n\r\n_Pain in the left scapular region_, confined to a small spot. _Fluoric\r\nacid_ and _Lilium tig._ have pain confined to a small spot in any\r\nlocation, while _Oxalic acid_ has a pain confined to small longitudinal\r\nspots. _Magnesia phos._ has a sharp burning pain, about an inch in\r\ndiameter, under the border of the left scapula, as from a hot iron (see\r\nalso _Phos._); with _Onosmodium_ there is a dull, aching pain in the\r\nbiceps muscle, also a pain of like nature in the elbow joint and wrists.\r\n_The arms and hands feel tired and weak_; they tremble. Inability to\r\nco-ordinate the muscular movements of the arms. Pain in the phalangeal\r\narticulation.\r\n\r\nThe aggravations are generally from motion or jarring; from pressure or\r\ntightness of clothing.\r\n\r\nThe ameliorations are peculiar and marked. Better when quiet, _when\r\nlying down on the back_, _when undressed_, when in the open air, from\r\nsleep, _from cold drinks_, _from eating_.\r\n\r\nIn the generalities we find great MUSCULAR WEAKNESS OR PROSTRATION AND\r\nTIRED FEELING OVER THE ENTIRE BODY. A feeling as though one had just\r\ngotten up from a severe spell of sickness. Nervous trembling as if from\r\nhunger. The least exertion produces a tremulousness. _The muscles feel\r\ntreacherous and unsteady as though one did not dare to trust them._ A\r\ndesire to change position without any definite cause or reason, and\r\nwithout any change for the better or worse. Later in the proving there\r\nwas a desire to lie down and be quiet, with a drowsy, sleepy feeling. _A\r\nsensation as if a chill would come on_; a tired, aching, stretching,\r\ngaping, disagreeable feeling. All sensations are worse in the left side.\r\n\r\nIn my own experience I have used the remedy from the mother tincture up.\r\nI got no results from the tincture. Hardly any from the 30th, but a\r\nmarked, decided, and very rapid action from the CM. I use nothing lower\r\nthan the CM, and prefer the higher.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGANUM MAJORANA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Labiatae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Sweet Marjoram.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The whole plant without the root, gathered when in flower,\r\nis macerated in two times its weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (A treatise on the \"Sexual Passion,\" by the late Dr.\r\n     Gallavardin, Lyons, France, contains this item on\r\n     _Origanum_):\r\n\r\nThe person who discovered a remedy that in a certain sense may be\r\nconsidered as a specific against sexual passion was a clergyman of\r\nMizza, the founder of an orphan asylum. This remedy is _Origanum\r\nmajorana_ (or common marjoram), which proves effective in masturbation\r\nand in excessively-aroused sexual impulses. The author uses it in the\r\n4th dilution, as he has not found the higher potencies effective. He\r\ndissolves five or six globules of this dilution in four teaspoonfuls of\r\nfresh water, and the young masturbator takes of this every two days, a\r\nquarter of an hour before the meal, one teaspoonful. If the cure is not\r\naccomplished eight days after this solution is used up, the same dose is\r\nrepeated in the same way. When desired, this remedy can be used,\r\naccording to the author, without the knowledge of the patient, by\r\npouring a teaspoonful into the soup, milk or chocolate.\r\n\r\nThe effect frequently appears very rapidly, but sometimes it does not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXYTROPIS LAMBERTI.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Leguminosae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, \"Loco\" Weed. Rattle Weed.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The whole plant without the root is macerated in two times\r\nits weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following proving of the \"loco weed\" was conducted\r\n     by the late Dr. W. S. Gee, of Chicago, in 1887):\r\n\r\n\r\nOXYTROPIS LAMBERTI, Pursh.--_Commonly taller, as well as larger_, than\r\nother varieties (the scapes often a foot or more high); silky,--and\r\nmostly silvery-pubescent, sometimes glabrate in age; leaflets from\r\noblong-lanceolate to linear (4 to 16 inches long); _spike, sometimes\r\nshort-oblong and densely flowered_, at least when young; _often\r\nelongated and sparsely flowered_; _flowers mostly large_ (often an inch\r\nlong, but sometimes much smaller), variously colored; pod, either\r\nnarrowly or broadly oblong, _sericeous pubescent_, _firm-coriaceous_,\r\nhalf-inch or more long, _imperfectly two-celled_. Includes _O.\r\nCampestris_ of Hook, Fl. Bor. Am., in part. Common along the Great\r\nPlains from Saskatchewan and Minnesota to New Mexico, Texas, etc., and\r\nin the foot-hills.--From Coulter's _Manual of the Botany of the Rocky\r\nMountain Region_.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the poisonous members of that family. It is found in\r\nCalifornia and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt is a perennial plant, with herbaceous or slightly shrubby stems, the\r\nfoliage remaining green during winter when grass is scarce, and so\r\nattracting animals that would otherwise probably instinctively shun it.\r\nThe plants do not appear to be equally poisonous at all seasons or in\r\nall localities, and it has been doubted whether the active properties\r\nthey possess are due to a normal constituent of the plant. No medical\r\nuse has ever been made of these plants, although their poisonous\r\ncharacter has often led to the suggestion that they might be found\r\nvaluable. No physiological study has been made of the action of the\r\npoison, and no complete chemical analysis has as yet appeared.\r\n\r\nThe stockmen speak of it as causing intoxication in the animals which\r\neat it, and a prominent symptom is the \"loco\" condition, in which the\r\npower of co-ordination is lost or greatly limited. They cannot readily\r\nreadjust for changes in gait, etc. A horse travels on level ground, but\r\nfinds great difficulty in changing to pass over an elevation or\r\ndepression, or, when going up hill, he has great difficulty in starting\r\ndown hill; it is difficult, when he is still, to impress him that he\r\nmust go, and as difficult to stop him when desired. The same rule\r\napplies to eating and other necessaries. Such a horse is said to be\r\n\"locoed.\" Professor Hawkes procured specimens from which Boericke &\r\nTafel made a tincture. To further test the merits of the remedy, the\r\nstudents of the class at Hahnemann Medical College of Chicago kindly\r\nparticipated in a proving.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hawkes received some reports from his group, but has mislaid\r\nhis papers, and he is unable to give in detail the symptoms produced. He\r\nstated, however, that the principal action corroborated that given\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nDuring 1886-'87 term I made another attempt, and a few reports were\r\nreceived. The remedy was given by number, that the prover should not\r\nknow what he took, nor the strength of it. Some were given the [Greek:\r\ntheta], others 1x^d, 2x^d, 3x^d, 12x powders, 30x powders, and some\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nA few reported \"no effect\" from the [Greek: theta]. The following\r\nincludes the report from five persons:\r\n\r\n1. (Mr. S. P. F., 10 drops of [Greek: theta].) 2. (Mrs. W., 10 drops of\r\n3x^d repeated.) 3. (Mr. G. H. A., 15 drops of 3x^d.) 4. (Mrs. P.,\r\npowders of 12x repeated.) 5. (Mrs. L., powders of 30x.) 6. (Mrs. L.,\r\npowders of 12x.)\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.\r\n\r\n_Mind._--Great mental depression,^1,^3.

As the\r\nchill passes off a smarting in the throat and a feeling as though the\r\nlungs and bronchi would close up, making breathing very difficult; chill\r\nlasted until 1 P.M., followed by perspiration of palms of the hands and\r\nsoles of the feet; the changeable pains remained until 3 P.M., when all\r\ndisappeared,^2. No thirst in either stage,^2. Felt badly for three days\r\nat same hour as chill,^2. For four weeks on every seventh day had a\r\nchill with all the above symptoms; the coldness of the spine was\r\ncontinuous for eight weeks, and was then removed by _Gelsemium_,^2.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. W. D. Gentry, while at Las Vegas, New Mexico, made\r\n     the following summary of the action of the remedy.\r\n     _Homoeopathic Recorder_, 1895):\r\n\r\nFor the present I will only give a few of the leading symptoms produced\r\nby the _Loco weed_:\r\n\r\nBrain and Mind: Stimulation of mind; pleasant intoxicated feeling.\r\nSatisfied indifference to all influences and interests.\r\n\r\nHead: Full, warm feeling about the head.\r\n\r\nEyes: Strange feeling of fullness about the eyes, with sight obscured,\r\nso that it appears that one is looking through clear water which\r\nproduces about all of the seven prismatic colors, red, orange, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, purple and violet.\r\n\r\nParalysis of nerves, and muscles of the eyes, producing amblyopia.\r\nPupils contracted and do not respond to light.\r\n\r\nEyesight lost with feeling as if in consequence of long exposure to\r\nstrong, arc-electric lights.\r\n\r\nNeck and Back: Numb, pithy or woody feeling about and in the spine.\r\n\r\nLower Extremities: Loss of power to control movements of body or limbs.\r\n\r\nSwaying, staggering gait.\r\n\r\nReflex action of tendon-patella lost.\r\n\r\nGeneral: Weakness and insecurity of all powers of locomotion.\r\n\r\nFeeling of intoxication, with almost entire loss of vision.\r\n\r\nAmblyopia: sense of touch greatly weakened.\r\n\r\n     (From the _Kansas City Star_.)\r\n\r\nThe loco weed of the Western plains is to vegetation what the\r\nrattlesnake is to animal life. The name comes from the Spanish and\r\nsignifies insanity. It is a dusky green and grows in small bunches or\r\nhandfuls and scatters itself in a sparse and meagre way about the\r\ncountry. It is in short a vegetable nomad and travels about not a\r\nlittle. Localities where it this season flourishes in abundance may not\r\nsee any of it next year, nor indeed for a number of years to come.\r\n\r\nThe prime property of the loco is to induce insanity in men or animals\r\nwho partake of it. Animals--mules, horses, sheep and cattle--avoid it\r\nnaturally, and under ordinary circumstances never touch it. But in the\r\nwinter, when an inch or two of snow has covered the grass, these green\r\nbunches of loco standing clear and above the snow are tempting bits to\r\nanimals which are going about half starved at the best. Even then it is\r\nnot common for them to eat it. Still, some do and it at once creates an\r\nappetite in the victim similar in its intense force to the alcohol habit\r\nin mankind.\r\n\r\nOnce started on the downward path of loco a mule will abandon all other\r\nforms of food and look for it. In a short time its effects become\r\nperfectly apparent. You will see a locoed mule standing out on the\r\nshadowless plain with not a living, moving thing in his vicinity. His\r\nhead is drooping and his eyes are half closed. On the instant he will\r\nkick and thresh out his heels in the most warlike way. Under the\r\ninfluence of loco he sees himself surrounded by multitudes of\r\nthreatening ghosts and is repelling them.\r\n\r\nThe mind of the animal is completely gone. He cannot be driven or worked\r\nbecause of his utter lack of reason. He will go right or left or turn\r\naround in the harness in spite of bits or whip, or will fail to start or\r\nstop, and all in a vacant, idiotic way devoid of malice. The victim\r\nbecomes as thin physically as mentally, and after retrograding four or\r\nfive months at last dies, the most complete wreck on record. Many\r\ngruesome tales are furnished of cruel Spanish and Mexican ladies who, in\r\na jealous fit, have locoed their American admirers through the medium of\r\nloco tea. Two or three cases in kind are reported in the Texas lunatic\r\nasylum.\r\n\r\n\r\nOENTHE CROCATA.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh root is macerated in two parts by weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following paper on _OEnanthe crocata_ was kindly\r\n     sent to the editor by Dr. W. A. Dewey, of the Ann Arbor\r\n     University, Michigan):\r\n\r\n_OEnanthe crocata_ belongs to the large family of the Umbelliferae\r\nwhich furnishes us with _Conium_ and _Cicuta_. It grows in marshy\r\nlocalities in England and France. In Botanical works of the 16th and\r\n17th centuries it was often confounded with _Cicuta virosa_, an error\r\nwhich has even been made in more recent times, in fact, only one\r\nBotanist of the 19th century described the plant with sufficient\r\nexactness for its recognition, and that was DeLobel, who published his\r\nBotany in 1851. It is one of the largest plants of the family, being 3\r\nto 5 feet high. Our tincture is from the fresh root.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL.--_OEnanthe_ was known to Galen and Dioscorides, and\r\nnumerous citations might be made to show that the drug was used from the\r\nearliest times in various affections, affections that nearly every drug\r\nwas tried in, but it is in the \"Cyanosura Materia Medica of Boecler,\r\npublished in 1729,\" that we first find a hint as to its true action.\r\n\"Those who ate much of it were taken with dark vertigos, going from one\r\nplace to another, swaying, frightened, turning in a circle as Lobilus\r\npretends to have seen.\"\r\n\r\nHahnemann, in his \"Apotheker Lexicon\" (Leipzig, 1793), says of the drug:\r\n\"It is said that the whole plant is poisonous and causes vertigo,\r\nstupefaction, loss of force, convulsions, delirium, stiffness,\r\ninsensibility, falling of the hair, and taken in large quantities will\r\ncause death.\"\r\n\r\nHe says further: \"That, administered with great circumspection, it\r\nshould prove useful in certain varieties of delirium, vertigos and\r\ncramps.\"\r\n\r\nThis is interesting coming from Hahnemann at the time when he had\r\ndiscovered the law, but had not as yet given it to the world.\r\n\r\n_OEnanthe_ was considered in the last century as one of the most\r\npernicious plants of Europe, especially for cattle, who, having eaten\r\nit, can neither vomit nor digest it and they soon die in convulsions;\r\nthis from the root, however, as they eat the leaves with impunity. It is\r\ninteresting to note that animals poisoned with it decompose rapidly.\r\n\r\nMuch of the following study is taken from a series of excellent papers\r\non the drug, which have been appearing for over a year in \"Le Journal\r\nBelge D'Homoeopathie,\" from the pen of Dr. Ch. DeMoor, of Alost,\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ACTION.--From a very large collection of observations of cases\r\nof poisoning with _OEnanthe_, dating from 1556 to the present time and\r\nrecorded in \"Allen's Encyclopaedia,\" the \"Cyclopaedia of Drug\r\nPathogenesy,\" and in the article of Dr. DeMoor, above mentioned, we find\r\nthat _OEnanthe crocata_ produces, almost invariably, convulsions of an\r\nepileptiform character and which are marked by the following symptoms:\r\n\r\nSwollen, livid face, sometimes pale.\r\n\r\nFrothing at mouth.\r\n\r\nContraction of chest and oppressed breathing.\r\n\r\nDilated pupils or irregular. Eyeballs turned upward.\r\n\r\nColdness of the extremities.\r\n\r\nPulse weak.\r\n\r\nConvulsions are especially severe, at first tonic then clonic.\r\n\r\nLocked jaws.\r\n\r\nTrembling and twitching of muscles.\r\n\r\n_OEnanthe_ also produces a delirium in which the patient becomes as if\r\ndrunken, there is stupefaction, obscuration of vision and fainting.\r\n\r\nThe Greek name of the plant signifies \"wine flower,\" and so-called on\r\naccount of its producing a condition similar to wine drunkenness, and\r\nthere is a difference, so I have heard, between wine and other beverages\r\nin this respect. Hiccoughs are also produced by the drug.\r\n\r\nThere is also great heat in the throat and stomach and a desire to vomit\r\nand to have stool, and a great deal of weakness of the limbs and\r\ncardialgia. Like other members of the same family, as _Conium_, it\r\nproduces very much vertigo, this has always been present in the cases of\r\npoisoning with the plant. In a number of cases who had been poisoned by\r\nthe drug the hair and nails fell out.\r\n\r\nHOMOEOPATHIC ACTION AND APPLICABILITY.--The uses of _OEnanthe_,\r\nhomoeopathically, have been taken from the reports above mentioned;\r\nthe drug has never been proved, and it is doubtful if one could be found\r\nwho would prove it to the convulsion-producing extremity. All the\r\nevidence in all the authorities shows clearly that the drug produces in\r\nman all the symptoms of epilepsy, and it is in that disease that\r\nclinical testimony is gradually accumulating. Accepting the theory that\r\nepilepsy is a disturbance or irritation in the cortex of the brain, it\r\nwould seem that _OEnanthe crocata_, which produces congestion of the\r\npia mater, would prove a close pathological simillimum to epilepsy. Its\r\nusefulness in this disease is unmistakable and only another proof of the\r\ntruth of the homoeopathic law.\r\n\r\nLet us review briefly some of the evidence of its action: Dr. S. H.\r\nTalcott, in the report of the Middletown Asylum, 1893, notes that\r\n_OEnanthe_ possesses a marked power in epilepsy, stating that it makes\r\nthe attack less frequent, less violent and improves the mental state of\r\nthe patient. He prescribes it in the tincture, 1 to 6 drops daily.\r\n\r\nIn the Materia Medica Society of New York its use has been verified\r\nseveral times. Dr. Paige greatly benefited a case with the 3x potency.\r\n\r\nDr. F. H. Fisk reports the cure of a case which had lasted two years,\r\nwith the tincture. This case during the last month before the doctor\r\ntook it was having from 6 to 10 attacks daily.\r\n\r\nDr. Garrison, of Easton, Pa., reports a case of reflex uterine or\r\nhystero-epilepsy in which the 2x acted promptly.\r\n\r\nAllen in his Hand-Book mentions the cure of three cases with the remedy.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Ritchie Horner reports that the remedy greatly modified the\r\nattacks in a lady who had had the disease over 20 years, and who, for\r\nthe two months previous, had had a convulsion daily. He used the 3x.\r\n\r\nDr. J. S. Cooper, of Chillicothe, Ohio, reports the cure of a case of 25\r\nyears' standing with the 4x.\r\n\r\nDr. Henderson reports the cure of a case of 9 years' standing, where the\r\npatient was almost idiotic; the convulsions were relieved and the mental\r\ncondition was greatly relieved and improved. In two other cases equally\r\nsatisfactory results were had.\r\n\r\nDr. D. A. Baldwin, of Englewood, N. J., entirely controlled the\r\nconvulsions in a young man of 16 with _OEnanthe_.\r\n\r\nDr. Ord reports a case of petit mal cured with the 3x, and in a South\r\nAmerican homoeopathic journal a Dr. Rappaz reports the cure of a case\r\nof three years' standing with increasing seizures with the remedy in\r\ndoses ranging from the 6 to the 12.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. W. A. Dunn reported a genuine cure of a young girl of 16\r\nwho had been epileptic for 7 years, latterly having as many as 4 or 5\r\nattacks during a night. The remedy caused these attacks to entirely\r\ndisappear. The girl commenced menstruating at 12, so the establishment\r\nof the menses had nothing to do with the cure.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles A. Wilson, of San Antonio, Texas, reports a number of cases\r\ncured with _OEnanthe_ in the 3x dilution, and the same potency greatly\r\nlessened the number of seizures in others.\r\n\r\nDr. Purdon, of the University of Dublin, relates a case of epilepsy\r\ncured with this drug in 1 to 6 drop doses several times a day.\r\n\r\nDr. F. E. Howard, in a case which had 3 or 4 attacks a week, gave 5\r\ndrops of the tincture every two hours, which caused violent pains in the\r\nhead, but complete recovery followed on reducing the dose.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases of the cure of epilepsy with _OEnanthe_ in alternation\r\nwith _Silicea_ or some other drug have been reported, but as the\r\nquestion, \"which cured?\" comes in they need not be given.\r\n\r\nIn my own practice I have had some marked results from its action and\r\nhave seen it modify attacks when everything else failed. In two cases,\r\none a boy of 13 who had had the disease 5 years and who had suffered\r\nmuch of many sphincter-stretching orificialists and \"lots of other\r\nthings,\" the remedy made a complete cure; the other case was in a man of\r\n30 who had the grand mal, the petit mal and the epileptic vertigo.\r\n_OEnanthe_ removed entirely the two former conditions leaving only the\r\nlatter, and that in a very mild degree. It also greatly improved the\r\nmental condition of the patient.\r\n\r\nI have several cases under treatment at the present time, and some of\r\nthem are showing a marked effect from its use. The question of dose I\r\nbelieve to be an important one. I used generally the tincture in water,\r\nbut latterly I have been using the third, and I believe with better\r\neffect than I ever obtained with the tincture, and I am now of the\r\nopinion that the lower dilutions, say from the 3 to the 12, will be\r\nfound more efficacious than the tincture, and the higher potencies will\r\nsuit certain cases. In order to prescribe the drug with accuracy\r\nprovings will be necessary to develop its finer symptomatology.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARAFFINE.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The purified Paraffin is triturated in the usual way.\r\n\r\n(This proving was made by Dr. Wahle, of Germany, who was the chemist of\r\nHahnemann. He never published it, but gave the manuscript to his son,\r\nwho in his turn gave it to Dr. Held, now a practicing physician in Rome.\r\nDr. Held at the request of his colleagues translated it into Italian and\r\nit appeared in the medical journal, _L'Omiopatia in Italia_, from which\r\nthis article is translated and slightly condensed. The remedy is used by\r\nthe homoeopaths of Rome and found to be valuable in uterine and other\r\ntroubles, indicated by the proving. It is particularly serviceable in\r\nconstipation.)\r\n\r\nPROVING OF PARAFFINE.\r\n\r\nHEAD.\r\n\r\nWeight in the head.\r\n\r\nBruised feeling in the left side of the occiput.\r\n\r\nHead heavy and dull; a feeling when leaning forward as if a weight fell\r\ntoward the forehead.\r\n\r\nPulsation in the head.\r\n\r\nPressing pain in the head, extending from the vertex toward the forehead\r\nas if something would come out.\r\n\r\nPricking, stinging in the head, extending to the left temporal bone.\r\n\r\nPain as of a contusion in occiput.\r\n\r\nAt 9 o'clock in the morning there comes a pain in the left side of the\r\nvertex as if a nail were being driven into the head, with extension of\r\nthe pain to the left lower jaw.\r\n\r\nTouching the left side of the head causes pain as if the part were\r\ncrushed and a feeling as if the whole side of the head were soft and\r\nspongy.\r\n\r\nTwisting and wrenching in the sinciput so that he must lie down; having\r\nlain down a quarter of an hour, and having placed the right hand under\r\nthe head, there was experienced a feeling of painless shock so that the\r\nhand under the head was drawn away and the legs were thrown down from\r\nthe sofa. Soon afterward occurred severe palpitation of the heart.\r\n\r\nTwisting and wrenching in the whole head, as well as the face.\r\n\r\nFeeling as of knife stabs under the right temporal bone extending into\r\nthe right eye and becoming worse on bending over. On the outside of the\r\nforehead a pressing pain which seems to thrust inward, passing, in half\r\nan hour, into the inside of the head.\r\n\r\nPainful pulsation in the forehead, which gradually disappears when lying\r\ndown, but becomes worse when bending over.\r\n\r\nThe left side of the head and face suffer most; pains stinging and\r\ntwisting, often going and returning at the same time.\r\n\r\nTwisting in the left side of the head and face; the teeth of the same\r\nside ache as if they would fall out.\r\n\r\nOn touching the vertex the skin pains as if it were suppurating, in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nSticking in the forehead extending into the nose.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the head feels soft on being touched or as if suppuration\r\nwas going on underneath it.\r\n\r\nFalling out of the hair.\r\n\r\nEYES.\r\n\r\nThrobbing and sticking over the right eyebrow laterally and from\r\nwithout, extending into the lower jaw and there disappearing.\r\n\r\nStinging pains above the left eye and toward the temple.\r\n\r\nRaised spots upon the cornea.\r\n\r\nThe eyes seem as if there was a veil before them in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the eyelids are closed with mucus; dry mucus in the\r\ninternal angles of the eyes.\r\n\r\nItching in the internal angles of the eyes which ceases a moment on\r\nrubbing, but a sore pain remains and very soon the itching returns\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nPressing pains under the right upper eyelids as if some foreign body had\r\ngotten in.\r\n\r\nPain under the upper eyelids as if from the prick of a needle.\r\n\r\nThe eyelids are red, as after crying.\r\n\r\nPain as of a wound in the external angle of the left eye, in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nItching of the eyelids, lasting the whole day. Rubbing relieves only for\r\na short time.\r\n\r\nA feeling in the eyes as if they had fat in them.\r\n\r\nA feeling in the eyes as if they were always moist.\r\n\r\nEyes moist and tearful.\r\n\r\nThe mucus in the internal angles of the eyes is cold and viscid.\r\n\r\nLachrymation and itching of the eyes in the morning on rising.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the left eye is closed with mucus and seems to have a\r\nveil before it.\r\n\r\nA veil before the eyes or they feel as if they contained fat observed on\r\nrubbing the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are dim, she sees nothing, but feels everything; has sensation\r\nas if all the limits were numb for five minutes toward evening.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are pale; things seem to be seen through a veil. Little black\r\nflies are seen before the eyes.\r\n\r\nShort vision on account of the many little black flies before the eyes.\r\n\r\nOn fixing any object for some time the eyes become moist, as if a cold\r\nwind was blowing into them, with a gentle itching.\r\n\r\nIn the open air there seems to be a black veil before the eyes; objects\r\nseen seem to be pale, with short vision.\r\n\r\nShe sees objects as if in a mist.\r\n\r\nThe white of the eye is full of blood; worse toward the external angle.\r\n\r\nFACE.\r\n\r\nItching in the face as from urticaria, smooth red spots come out on the\r\nface.\r\n\r\nEAR.\r\n\r\nRoaring in the right ear like the rumbling of a mill wheel, in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nGurgling in the left ear like the beating of the pulse.\r\n\r\nRinging in both ears, in the morning.\r\n\r\nStinging and twisting in the left ear, with a feeling as if it was\r\nstopped up.\r\n\r\nThe odor of cordials is perceived.\r\n\r\nThe nose is moist and there is frequent desire to blow it, but without\r\nsneezing.\r\n\r\nBlood from the nose of a dark red color.\r\n\r\nTEETH.\r\n\r\nTearing in the teeth on the right side of the jaw, extending to the ear\r\non the same side.

The stomach swells up\r\nlike a ball and forces itself upwards; hard and very painful to the\r\ntouch; there is also very little appetite.\r\n\r\nWhen the pains in the stomach subside, those in the teeth also\r\ndisappear, as if there was a causal relation between the two.\r\n\r\nWeight in the stomach as if there was a stone placed upon it, in the\r\nmorning, evening and after dinner during the time of digestion, that is\r\nfrom half an hour to an hour after meals.\r\n\r\nSometimes there occurs palpitation of the heart in connection with these\r\nstomach symptoms, so severe that he is often incapacitated from doing\r\nanything whatever.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, between nine and ten o'clock, griping and drawing with\r\ncrawling in the stomach, which extends into the chest and between the\r\nshoulders, causing oppression of the chest with a sense of heat.\r\n\r\nThe face and hands become hot and red and there is hot sweat upon the\r\nupper part of the body, especially upon the forehead.\r\n\r\nABDOMEN.\r\n\r\nSense of lassitude in the abdomen which grows less when the parts are\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nSwelling of the abdomen and nausea as if about to vomit.\r\n\r\nFeeling in the abdomen as if he had been disemboweled; he wishes to\r\nwalk fast which causes the parts to pain severely.\r\n\r\nCutting pains in the abdomen so that he was unable to sleep the whole\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIn the morning at 9 o'clock, colicky pains in the abdomen which ceased\r\nafter some minutes and a quantity of white mucus issued from the vagina;\r\nthese attacks are often repeated.\r\n\r\nUnder the umbilicus, a cutting pain as if caused by a sharp knife,\r\nextending down to the genitals.\r\n\r\nColicky pains for some hours internal to the umbilicus with a painful\r\nsensation as if a cord was bound around the abdomen above the stomach,\r\nlasting ten minutes.\r\n\r\nA griping sensation in the region of the umbilicus extending to the\r\nspine.\r\n\r\nWhen sitting, spasmodic pains in the lower portion of the abdomen\r\nextending into the rectum and coccyx. After long sitting the pains are\r\nrelieved, but walking makes them worse so that the body must be held in\r\na slightly curved position.\r\n\r\nToward six in the afternoon, griping and cutting internal to the\r\numbilicus with nausea, afterward vomiting of acid water and at the end a\r\nlittle food, with twisting pains in the vertex and temples; dryness of\r\nthe mouth with much thirst.\r\n\r\nWrenching pains in the calves extending into the toes and preventing\r\nsleep the whole night; she does not know where to put her legs.\r\n\r\nAt 10 o'clock in the evening, without having supped, the abdomen\r\nsuddenly swelled as if she had eaten to excess; before and during the\r\nattack flat and viscid taste in the mouth. She went to bed in this\r\ncondition and on waking in the morning the attack was entirely gone, the\r\nbowels, however, refused to move.\r\n\r\nPainless swelling of the abdomen lasting twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nAbdomen hard; tense and swollen with painless rumblings unaccompanied\r\nwith belching of wind; he goes to bed with these symptoms, but they are\r\ngone in the morning.\r\n\r\nHowever, there remains a constrictive pain below the ribs, passing\r\nacross the stomach with much thirst. Five hours later there occurred\r\nalvine discharges; the first was very hard with much tenesmus, so that\r\nthe whole abdomen was retracted; the last discharges were fluid,\r\nabundant and without tenesmus, in consequence of which the swelling of\r\nthe abdomen went down a little.\r\n\r\nThe pains disappear, however, with redness of the face, alternating with\r\ncold sweat.\r\n\r\nStanding and walking soon bring back the symptoms again.\r\n\r\nPressing the arm against the stomach and squeezing it relieved the pain\r\nand then she was able to breathe deeply, which she could not do\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nStomach swollen in the afternoon; went to bed at 10 o'clock and slept\r\none hour, awoke with urging to vomit and soon after threw up acid water\r\nand the food taken the preceding day.\r\n\r\nGriping in the abdomen, extending down into the rectum, with a feeling\r\nas if this organ was ligated; she feels so weak that she has to support\r\nherself to keep from falling, with cold sweat in the face, lasting half\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nSevere itching in the abdomen which ceases and is always followed by\r\ncopious white expectoration, with flashes of heat in the face and great\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nAt first coldness in the feet, then stinging and pressing pains in the\r\nright hypochondrium. From here the pains pass to the stomach with\r\nswelling of the abdomen; then they extend up the spine to the shoulders.\r\n\r\nSpasmodic, stabbing pains, one after the other, in the Mons Veneris,\r\nwhen standing on her feet she has a desire to put one foot over the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA spasmodic pain in the left inguinal region as of incarcerated wind,\r\nwhich extends upward across the abdomen, causing a painful spot in the\r\nregion of the spleen.\r\n\r\nSTOOL.\r\n\r\nBowels confined for two days and very hard; the evacuation occurs in\r\nsmall pieces.\r\n\r\nNo evacuation for three days, the abdomen seems very full, as if much\r\nhad been eaten, with loss of appetite.\r\n\r\nEvacuations accompanied with stinging, cutting pains in the rectum which\r\npersist more than an hour, with vehement tenesmus.\r\n\r\nObstinate constipation in children is readily cured.\r\n\r\nThe child has a movement only once in three or four days, accompanied\r\nwith severe pain in the anus.\r\n\r\nFrequent desire for stool without result.\r\n\r\nStools hard but occurring every day.\r\n\r\nAfter going for three days without stool he is obliged to remain an hour\r\nbefore expelling anything and becomes very much fatigued.\r\n\r\nEvacuations hard as nuts expelled with much difficulty, with spasmodic\r\npains in the intestines; the feces escape in small pieces.\r\n\r\nChronic constipation with hemorrhoids and continual urging to stool\r\nwithout result.\r\n\r\nURINARY ORGANS, ETC.\r\n\r\nOften passes much urine.\r\n\r\nFrequent desire to pass urine after cramps in the stomach.\r\n\r\nWas obliged to urinate three times in the space of four hours, but only\r\na small quantity each time; otherwise she only urinated once during the\r\nsame length of time and with strangury.\r\n\r\nUrine very hot and light colored.\r\n\r\nPasses much urine and after a quarter of an hour passes an equally large\r\nquantity, although she had drunk but little.\r\n\r\nSlight itching and burning in the vulva when not urinating.\r\n\r\nFeeling of heat in the vulva.\r\n\r\nVery hot urine causing heat at the vulva.\r\n\r\nVery hot urine with burning pain at the vulva.\r\n\r\nThe menstruation appears several days too late.\r\n\r\nThe blood is black and abundant.\r\n\r\nThe menstrual blood is reddish-black.\r\n\r\nThe menstruation comes on six days too soon, when on the feet the blood\r\nflows continuously.\r\n\r\nDuring the menstruation she feels cold externally and hot internally and\r\nmust drink a great deal.\r\n\r\nCutting pains through the body on the second day of the menstruation.\r\n\r\nWhite fluid discharge like milk coming away in drops.\r\n\r\nVery profuse white discharge, leaving white and gray spots on the linen,\r\nwith itching in the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe white discharge has a sweetish odor.\r\n\r\nA chronic rattling in the throat causes a dry cough.\r\n\r\nThe whole chest pains as if compressed, and when breathing, sharp\r\nstabbing pains traverse the chest, worse on the left side.\r\n\r\nStinging in the chest which prevents him from taking a long breath.\r\n\r\nPain in the region of the diaphragm as if it was inflamed; when gaping,\r\ndrawing pains under the right ribs, extending as far as the spine; they\r\ncome and go frequently and are aggravated by respiration.\r\n\r\nStabbing pains one after another in the upper portion of the left\r\nbreast, worse when breathing, lasting half an hour.\r\n\r\nStinging pains under the false ribs on the left side which grow on lying\r\ndown, on external pressure and on deep respiration with flashes of heat.\r\n\r\nTwisting pains in the left breast.\r\n\r\nThe nipples pain on touching them, as if they were sore inside.\r\n\r\nBACK.\r\n\r\nPains in the spine, extending into the lumbar vertebrae and then into\r\nboth sides above the crests of the ilia and into the inguinal regions,\r\nwhere a pain as of inflammation is felt.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal pains are increased by bending.\r\n\r\nPains in the spine as if it had been injured, as bad during repose as\r\nwhen in motion.\r\n\r\nDrawing and stinging between the shoulders with oppression of breath.\r\n\r\nDrawing pains between the shoulders, extending downward along the spine,\r\ntoward the liver and upward into the chest;

ORD., Synanthereae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, \"Bitter broom.\" Escoba amaya.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The dry plant is macerated in five parts by weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Edward Fornias contributed to the _Homoeopathic\r\n     Recorder_, 1886, two papers on this remedy. The first\r\n     gave the results of physiological experiments; the second\r\n     is a resume of those results, including the proving by\r\n     Dr. B. H. B. Sleght, as follows:)\r\n\r\n_Resume of Symptoms._--If we boil down the matter, extracting only the\r\nsymptoms and changes observed during the above experiments with\r\n_Parthenina_, we have the following: _Heaviness and dulness of head,\r\ntendency to vertigo, malaise, apathy, lassitude, profuse and very fluid\r\nsalivation, sensation of heat and weight in the stomach, increased\r\nappetite, gastric intolerance, nausea and vomiting. Increased stupor,\r\ndesire to be quiet, refusal of food, and indifference. Excitation of the\r\nheart beats, or slow beating of the heart; depressed circulation, or\r\ngeneral functional activity; pulse accelerated, or slow, weak, soft,\r\ncompressible, without dicrotism; progressive slowing of the pulse,\r\nfollowed by syncope, cardiac paralysis_ (and death). _Accelerated, or\r\nslow, irregular breathing_ (_Cheyne-Stokes_); _rise and fall of\r\ntemperature, tremors, shivering, diminished perspiration; dilation of\r\nthe pupils; convulsions_ (clonic and tonic); _muscular relaxation,\r\nanaesthesia and increased urine and saliva. _The kidneys were found\r\nenlarged and congested, with evident signs of sanguineous stasis. The\r\nprocess of coagulation of the blood was retarded. The red corpuscles\r\nincreased in volume. There was a fall of the blood-pressure, and\r\nvascular dilatation_ (of reflex origin). _The heart was found arrested\r\nin diastole, and the brain anaemic. A marked diminution of reflex action\r\nin the hips and extinction of the voluntary movements_, were noticed.\r\nAlso a transient excitement of the voluntary movements. And finally the\r\nsensibility and the muscular contractility were diminished._\r\n\r\nCASES CURED BY PARTHENINA.--In regard to the therapeutic value of\r\n_Parthenina_, little is known as yet, but the plant from which this\r\nalkaloid is derived, as said before, has been employed for years in\r\nCuba, both by the people and profession, against fevers of a paludal\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nDr. Ramirez Tovar has reported in several numbers of the _Cronica\r\nMedico-Quirurgica_, of Havana, the following cases treated by him with\r\n_Parthenina_, with the best results:\r\n\r\nCASE I.--\"A lady living in the lower part of the city, where the rain\r\nalways leaves constant channels of infection, was suffering with _daily\r\nattacks of intermittent_, which grew more intense every day. She\r\nreceived 1 gram of the salt, divided in six powders, to be taken one\r\nevery hour after the attack. The next day she had no chill, and the\r\nthermometer indicated the absence of fever. She was nursing at the time,\r\nand stated that she had noticed a marked increase of milk in her\r\nbreasts; 50 centigrams more, in doses, were given to her, and the fever\r\ndid not return again.\"\r\n\r\nCASE II.--\"A tailor, 30 years of age, had moved to the lower part of the\r\ncity and contracted a _tertian intermittent_. He had four paroxysms\r\nbefore the doctor saw him, the last one being _attended by much pain in\r\nthe left hypochondrium_. He received 1 gram, in 5 doses. There was\r\napyrexia on the day the attack was due, and this did not return again.\r\nThis man continued to live in the same house, under the same regimen and\r\nhygienic conditions.\"\r\n\r\nCASE III,--\"A little girl, 6 years of age, lymphatic constitution,\r\nliving near the beach of the harbor, was brought to Dr. Ramirez Tovar's\r\nclinic, suffering for 17 days with _malaise, loss of appetite,\r\nsleepiness and fever_. She had taken quinine, both internally and\r\nexternally, with little benefit, and _was wasting away notably_. At 4\r\nP.M. she commenced to take 50 centigrams of the salt, in 8 doses, and\r\nthe next day at the same hour the thermometer indicated a fall from\r\n39.5 deg. C. of the previous day to 38.5 deg. C. The mother was ordered to\r\nrepeat the medicine at longer intervals, but for want of means the child\r\ndid not take any more. On the 4th or 5th day the temperature went up to\r\n39.5 deg. again, then she was provided with the medicine, and 3 days later\r\nthe temperature was normal. The action of the alkaloid was aided here by\r\na tonic wine prepared from the extract of the plant.\"\r\n\r\nCASE IV.--\"A man 45 years of age, _of delicate constitution, poorly\r\nnourished, with a straw yellow face, yellow sclerotics, enlarged liver\r\nand spleen, the latter somewhat painful to pressure_, who had contracted\r\n_intermittent fever_ while in Panama, and had taken quinine, was\r\ncomplaining, when Dr. Ramirez Tovar saw him (middle part of December),\r\n_of a pain in the right side_ (more severe in some points than in\r\nothers), which commenced at 1 P.M., with _shiverings_, and which\r\ndisappeared after two hours to return again the next day at precisely\r\nthe same time and with the same symptoms. He received 1 gram of\r\n_Parthenina_, in 5 doses, one every hour, right after the cessation of\r\nthe pain. He was seen by the doctor the next day at 4 P.M., and up to\r\nthat time the pain had not returned. He took then 50 centigrams more, in\r\n5 doses, one every hour, and was free of pain until the latter part of\r\nJanuary, when he again consulted the doctor, this time the _pain being\r\nlocated in the stomach_, for which _Parthenina_ was repeated (1 gram in\r\n5 doses, one every two hours). The next day the pain had ceased, but\r\nreturned on the third, and he again received 1 gram, in the same manner\r\nas before, and since then he has been free from pain.\"\r\n\r\nCASE V.--\"A young lady, 18 years of age, complained of _facial neuralgia\r\nwith periodical exacerbations_, from which she was suffering four days.\r\nShe received 1 gram of _Parthenina_, in 5 doses, one every hour, and on\r\nthe following day she was entirely free from pain. Fifty centigrams\r\nmore, in 4 doses, were given to this lady to prevent a relapse, and the\r\nresult was a complete cure.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to finish this report, I will mention a case which came under my\r\nnotice: \"A little girl, my niece, 5 years old, living in Havana, who,\r\nwhen seen by the late Dr. Govantes, of that city, had been suffering for\r\nsome time before from _a continued fever, with periodical mid-day\r\nexacerbations, which later on, assumed an intermittent type_. She had\r\nbeen saturated with _quinine_, and complained, at the time, of\r\n_malaise_, _lassitude_, _languor_, _headache_, _loss of appetite_,\r\n_gastric intolerance_, _etc._ The temperature went up as high as 40.6 deg.\r\nC. during the hot stage, which was short and was followed by copious\r\nsweats, giving relief. _Parthenium hysterophorus_ in the form of an\r\nextract, prepared and sold at Dr. Villavicenci's Pharmacy, in Havana,\r\nwas prescribed by Dr. Govantes. Three doses a day, each of the size of a\r\npea, dissolved in water, were given for 4 or 5 days, and at the end of\r\nthat time she was entirely free of fever and made a quick recovery.\"\r\n\r\nIf such results can be ascribed to _Parthenium_ and its alkaloid\r\n_Parthenina_, I think it would be unjustifiable to set them aside. An\r\nearly proving of the plant will not only enhance our therapeutic\r\nresources, but prevent the non-scrupulous from employing it empirically.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProving of _Parthenium hysterophorus_, Dr. B.

ORD., Passifloraceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Passion flower.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh leaves and flowers gathered in May are macerated\r\nin two parts by weight of alcohol. A preparation may also be made from\r\nthe expressed juice of the fresh leaves.\r\n\r\n     (There has been so much written concerning this unproved\r\n     remedy that we can only give an abstract of a part of it.\r\n     Dr. Lindsay, formerly of Bayou Gras, La., was the first\r\n     to call attention to it a few weeks before his death. He\r\n     wrote in answer to an inquiry as follows--Hale's New\r\n     Remedies):\r\n\r\nI have much to say. I am satisfied it is no narcotic. It never stupefies\r\nor overpowers the senses. A patient under its full influence may be\r\nwakened up, and he will talk to you as rationally as ever he did; leave\r\nhim a moment and he will soon be off to the Elysian Fields again. I have\r\ntried it, my friend, in all sorts of neuralgic affections, and have\r\nusually astonished my more enlightened patients with it. Many times I\r\nhave had them to ask me what in the world it was that had such a sweet\r\ninfluence over them.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. L. Phares, of Newtonia, Miss., states):\r\n\r\nI never saw anything act so promptly in erysipelas. I have used it with\r\nadvantage in ulcers, neuralgias and tetanus. I have seen wonderful\r\neffects of it in relieving tetanus, and will mention one case from\r\nmemory: Some ten years ago I was called to see an old lady, in a distant\r\npart of the country, who was reported to be \"having fits.\" I found her\r\nto be able to be up most of the time, but, while examining her,\r\nconvulsions came on, affecting mainly the trunkal muscles, and drawing\r\nthe head back. I gave her instantly a dose of _Passiflora_. The\r\nconvulsions subsided, and she has never had one since. I continued the\r\nuse of the medicine in small doses for a few days. I have used it in\r\ntreating tetanus in horses--a disease usually considered as inevitably\r\nfatal to that noble animal. It has never failed to cure the horse. * *\r\nDuring the late war, my son, Dr. J. H. Phares, had occasion many times\r\nto prescribe the _Passiflora_ for tetanus in horses, with one invariable\r\nresult--prompt, perfect, permanent cure. He fortunately saw no case in\r\nman. * * * Since the foregoing was written, I have treated with the\r\nhydro-alcoholic extract of _Passiflora_ several cases of neuralgia, and\r\none of sleeplessness, with incessant motion and suicidal mania. With the\r\nsame extract during the current week, Dr. J. H. Phares has treated, with\r\nthe most prompt and satisfactory success, a very virulent and hopeless\r\ncase of tetanus, with ophisthotonos, trismus and convulsions, in a child\r\ntwo years old. Other most potent remedies, in heroic doses, having\r\nfailed to produce any effect in this case, he thinks that nothing but\r\nthe _Passiflora_ could possibly have saved the child.\r\n\r\n     (The editor of the _California Medical Journal_ (1889)\r\n     says):\r\n\r\nWe have been employing it [_Passiflora_] in some cases of spinal\r\nmeningitis after the acute symptoms had subsided, when the patients were\r\nunable to sleep, either day or night: could not endure the bed, and were\r\nunable to maintain the sitting posture, with highly satisfactory\r\nresults. It is administered in small doses. Add ten drops of the mother\r\ntincture (Homoeopathic) to half a tumbler of water; teaspoonful every\r\ntwo hours.\r\n\r\n     (At the meeting of the Homoeopathic Medical Society of\r\n     Delaware and Peninsula, November 14, 1889, Dr. W. D. Troy\r\n     read a paper on _Passiflora_ (see _Homoeopathic\r\n     Recorder_, May, 1890), from which we take the following):\r\n\r\nMy erysipelatous case was a man of some fifty years. When first seen was\r\na-bed, high fever, facial erysipelas of the flaming, rampant sort, the\r\none eye had disappeared, the other was in rapid retreat. Patient in\r\ngreat anxiety; sharp, stinging pains; could not rest. Was about to give\r\n_Apis_ when I thought of my _Passion flower_. Gave two-drop doses of the\r\ntincture every two hours. Put one-half an ounce of same into one quart\r\nof water for local application, to be applied hot by flannels and oiled\r\nsilk. After six hours patient fell asleep; was awakened for medicine\r\nevery three hours during the night; went to sleep easily after each\r\ndose. Said in morning he had had a night's good rest. Found inflammation\r\nmarkedly reduced. I now changed the remedy--gave _Ham._, both internally\r\nand externally. On next visit found patient every way worse. The disease\r\nhad sneaked across the scalp and invaded the whole face. The case began\r\nto look serious. Returned to the _Passiflora_ and kept to it with the\r\nmost happy results.\r\n\r\nMy next experience was in a Chorea--a girl budding into womanhood, but\r\nin whom the menses had not yet appeared. Child was well developed for\r\nher years, fourteen. I learned that for two or three years past the\r\nchild had \"fits,\" varying at times from moderate to severe. The neurosis\r\nwas unilateral, the right side alone being affected. The child had had\r\ntraditional treatment, \"off and on,\" for some time without manifest\r\nimprovement. I began with the _Passiflora_ 1x dil., 10 gtt. doses every\r\nthree hours. Kept it up for several days, the Choreic symptoms being not\r\nquite so violent; still I was growing anxious--wanted more positive\r\nresults. Added daily a five-drop dose of tincture. After a few more days\r\nthe mother informed me that there had been a slight \"show\"--merely\r\nenough to stain the diaper, and that for the last two days there had\r\nbeen hardly any \"fits.\" This was encouraging. I judged that the day of\r\ndeliverance was nigh. Very little more of the drug was given until about\r\nthe time for next menstrual flux. Then I resumed it with the most\r\nsatisfactory results. No nervous symptoms save such as are more or lest\r\ncommon to all women at the \"periods\" subsequently prevailed.\r\n\r\n     (The following case was reported by Dr. D. C. Buell\r\n     Dunlevy, of Port Chester, N. Y.--_Homoeopathic\r\n     Recorder_, Nov., 1890):\r\n\r\nMr. D----, aet. 52, sent for me to attend him during the month of May. I\r\nfound him presenting all the prodromal symptoms of delirium tremens, and\r\nat once ordered him to bed, and none too soon, as the event proved. For\r\nseven days he tossed about in a wild delirium, which was greatly\r\naggravated by marked gastric irritation. I had him carefully watched,\r\nboth day and night, until the delirium wore off. The treatment up to\r\nthis time was _Cannabis Ind._ for the mental trouble and _Nux v._, which\r\ngreatly relieved the gastric symptoms. But the moment he began to\r\nimprove the old cravings for liquor and morphine returned. Right here\r\nlet me say that for years he has been a great sufferer from piles, and\r\nthe only rest he could get was to sit propped up in his chair. His\r\nsufferings caused him to seek relief during the day in liquor, and at\r\nnights in morphine. And this habit had so fastened itself upon him that\r\ntry as he might he could not give it up. When he came under my treatment\r\nI at once put a stop to all stimulants and narcotics, but not without\r\nconsiderable trouble, for he seemed determined to have them. Night after\r\nnight he would lie there calling for something to make him sleep, and\r\nthis kept up until he was bordering on a state of insanity. Fully\r\nrealizing that something must be done, and that quickly, too, I made up\r\nmy mind to try _Passiflora_. This I did, and from the time I gave him\r\nthe first dose improvement set in and has continued ever since. I at\r\nfirst gave him a half teaspoonful of the [Greek: theta] at bed time, but\r\nthis not proving sufficient I increased it to a teaspoonful. He has now\r\nbeen taking it almost constantly for a period of eight weeks and claims\r\nhe has not had as natural a sleep for years; and lays particular stress\r\non the fact that when he awakes in the morning he feels so refreshed and\r\nhis mind remains clear. But what seems even more wonderful is that from\r\nthe day he first took this drug up to the present he has never felt the\r\nslightest desire to return to his former habits. The mere mention of\r\nliquor or opium seems to sicken him, and I am fully satisfied that he is\r\nnow cured and will (so far as liquor and opium are concerned) remain so.\r\nHe now takes special delight in praising the drug to his friends, and\r\nreally seems never to tire talking about the wonderful help it has been\r\nto him. I have also prescribed the drug to others for insomnia and\r\nalways with success, one case excepted, in which I gave it for\r\nhemicrania, and here, although it quieted the patient, it failed to\r\nproduce the desired sleep.\r\n\r\n     (The following is extracted from a paper on _Passiflora_,\r\n     by Dr. C. A. Walters, of Brooklyn. _Homoeopathic\r\n     Recorder_, July, 1890:)\r\n\r\nIn April, 1888, was called to an infant, 14 months, convulsions, caused\r\nby dentition; symptoms called for _Belladonna_, of which the 1x dil., 5\r\ndrops in half a glass water, teaspoonful every fifteen minutes until\r\nbetter, then once an hour. The child improved from start, and the\r\nconvulsions ceased in one hour from commencing the medicine. The next\r\nday the child appeared in usual health, and the _Belladonna_ was given\r\nonce in eight hours and discharged from further attendance.\r\n\r\nThirty-six hours after I was recalled, the child was in another spasm.\r\nNo _Belladonna_ symptoms being present I gave 5 drops of _Passiflora_\r\ntincture, every fifteen minutes, with the result that it never had\r\nanother spasm from that day to this. The child slept soundly all through\r\nthe night and awoke the next morning in its usual good health.\r\n\r\nSince then I have prescribed it for the sleeplessness of dentition\r\nwithout a failure, giving it usually in from 5 to 10 drops a dose, to be\r\nrepeated every fifteen minutes until sleep. I never give it during the\r\nday for this purpose, but begin at bedtime.\r\n\r\nIn the insomnia of adults, from whatsoever cause, I always give 60 drops\r\nat bedtime, and if not asleep in half an hour I give the same dose.\r\n\r\nExperience has taught me that to give it in smaller doses is a waste of\r\ntime and disappointing to the patient. Two such doses, _i. e._, 60 drops\r\na dose, are almost absolutely sure of giving the patient a natural and\r\nrefreshing sleep. The old school seem to have been forced to resort to\r\n_Sulfonal_ (whatever that may be) as the only thing capable of producing\r\nsleep, and yet, judging from the reports in their journals, it does not\r\nseem to \"fill the bill.\" Were they ever to give this a trial we would\r\nnot hear so much of _Morphine_, _Chloral_, _Bromides_, and the like.\r\n\r\nI have never used _Passiflora_ in erysipelas, having always been able to\r\ndischarge my patients in from two to four days by giving them\r\n_Jaborandi_.\r\n\r\nIn neuralgia and headache it has acted with wonderful rapidity, even the\r\nheadache of uterine displacements being brought under its influence. It\r\nis almost a daily occurrence to have people whom I never saw before come\r\nmiles to my office for that \"sleeping medicine made from the passion\r\nflower.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion let me say to the brethren, try it. But give it in\r\nappreciable doses. Don't be afraid of it. I would not hesitate to give\r\nit in four drachm doses, if required. But why give four when one will\r\ndo?\r\n\r\nP. S.--Since writing the foregoing I have used _Passiflora_ in two cases\r\nof delirium tremens. It acted like a charm in both cases; sent them to\r\nsleep in half an hour, and when they awoke, twelve and fourteen hours\r\nafter, they were themselves again. Sixty drops of tincture a dose, two\r\ndoses in each.\r\n\r\n     (The following was reported by Dr. Joseph Adolphus, in\r\n     _American Medical Journal_:)\r\n\r\nA lady who had for several months suffered untold agonies, as she\r\ndescribed her sufferings; her pain was described as if a weight of many\r\npounds was lying on her brain; the sense of pressure and tearing inside\r\nthe skull was fearful; her head felt as if enveloped in ice; the pains\r\nran down the back of her neck, and finally reached the lower end of\r\nsacrum, so that a slight touch of the coccyx caused exquisite agony.\r\nThis was a case in which coccygodinia was associated with the cerebral\r\nand spinal disease. I failed to relieve the pain for more than a few\r\nhours at a time with all other remedies I had tried; at this juncture,\r\nwhen despair was taking the place of hope, I thought of _Passiflora_,\r\nwhich I then administered in teaspoonful doses every two hours; the\r\nresult was something to be remembered, for she enjoyed excellent and\r\nrefreshing night's rest the following night, waking up in the morning\r\nmuch refreshed, nearly free from pain, with a good relish for breakfast.\r\nI continued the medicament every four hours for several days, for no\r\nfurther uses for medicine seemed indicated, as there was a rapid and\r\ncomplete recovery.\r\n\r\nA lady complained of pain in her rectum continuously; the coccyx was\r\nalso quite tender to the touch. There were several erosions on the lips\r\nof the os uteri; leucorrhoea and severe pain in the small of the back\r\nwhen a certain spot (over last dorsal and first and second lumbar\r\nvertebrae) was pressed on. I found she had been treated secundum artem\r\nfor the uterine trouble, locally and constitutionally, to no certain\r\nsatisfactory result. Her respirations were often twenty-eight to thirty\r\nper minute, much wakefulness, and at times feeling of constriction\r\nacross her breast and a sense as if her heart would stop beating.\r\nTeaspoonful doses of the _Passiflora incar._ was the specific in her\r\ncase. She continued it every four hours two weeks, but from the outset\r\nof treatment she felt the right remedy was administered.\r\n\r\nThese rectum troubles in women are frequently met with in practice. I\r\nfind the _Passiflora incar._ the best single remedy I have for them.\r\n\r\nRecently a man consulted me for a constant pain in his heart; he\r\ndescribed it as sharp and like a pang--often causing a sense of\r\nimmediate dissolution, and fear of death was on him all the time; pulse\r\nirregular in rhythm, now rapid, next slower, occasionally a beat\r\nmissing; sounds very normal, but accentuated and sharp. _Passiflora\r\nincarnata_ was a specific in this case; no doubt the center and probably\r\nthe local ganglia were irritated from some cause, and, whatever it was,\r\nthe medicament removed both.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I must not forget to say you will find it a valuable\r\nmedicament in sleeplessness and tossing restlessness in your fever\r\npatients. I use the tincture in teaspoonful doses every four hours. It\r\nappears the remedy has a soothing effect on the whole nervous system,\r\nwithout any appreciable narcotic properties.\r\n\r\n     (From the Transactions of the Twenty-fifth Annual Meeting\r\n     of the Maine Homoeopathic Medical Society we take the\r\n     following from a paper by Dr. A. I. Harvey on\r\n     _Passiflora_:)\r\n\r\nIt does no good where the inability to sleep is due to pain or distress\r\nof any kind; but in cases where we find that the nervous erethism is not\r\ncontrolled by the action of _Coffea_, _Opium_, _Sulphur_, or other\r\napparently indicated remedy. _Passiflora_ is in its place as a\r\nsuccedaneum for _Morphia_ or other sedatives. The dose varies from ten\r\ndrops to one dram of the tincture, according to the age of the patient.\r\nI do not hesitate, in the case of an adult, to give dram doses of the\r\ntincture every hour until the patient sleeps, and have seen it act in\r\nthe happiest manner in restoring the rhythm of the heart's action, when\r\nthat organ has been deranged in its movements by the combined effects of\r\nexhaustion and loss of sleep.\r\n\r\n_Passiflora_ has also given me much aid in a case of morphine habit of\r\nsix years' standing, which I cured wholly and entirely by the use of\r\nthis remedy. It is recommended in the above mentioned doses for delirium\r\ntremens, trismus, tetanus and kindred diseases of the nervous system,\r\nrepeated every hour or half-hour until relief is obtained. The remedy\r\nleaves no after effects, is incapable of creating an appetite, and, so\r\nfar as my observation extends, it is perfectly harmless even in large\r\ndoses, often repeated.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Scudder claimed that the one great indication for\r\n     _Passiflora_ in all cases is _a clean tongue_; when the\r\n     tongue is foul the remedy will do no good.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPENTHORUM SEDOIDES.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Crassulaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Ditch Stone Crop.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The whole fresh plant with the root is macerated in two\r\nparts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The _Medical Advance_ for June, 1887, contains a paper\r\n     by Dr. D. B. Morrow, from which the following is taken.)\r\n\r\nThe object of this paper is to call attention to the fact that the only\r\nproving of _Penthorum_ was made on scientific principles, as these\r\nverifications demonstrate. If the pathogenesy is carefully studied, it\r\nwill be seen to meet all the conditions of \"common colds,\" or acute\r\ncatarrhs, so prevalent in all sections of North America, from the\r\nsymptoms of chill, malaise, headache, soreness, cough, coryza, dry and\r\nflowing, with their secondary consequences of disturbed digestion,\r\nconstipation, debility, etc. and it will probably cure any or all of\r\nthese conditions when indicated by correspondence to the pathogenesy.\r\n\r\nA medicine having such a catarrhal range is probably a remedy for female\r\ntroubles equal to _Pulsatilla_ or _Calcarea_, and is worthy of a careful\r\nproving by women. It cures where antipsoric medicines have failed, and\r\npossibly may possess antipsoric qualities.\r\n\r\n_Authorities._--1, Dr. D. B. Morrow, U. S. Med. Inves., N. S., 3, p. 565\r\n(_Eclectic Med.

Have speedily cured several such coughs with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASEOLUS NANA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Leguminosae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Dwarf Bean.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The crushed beans are macerated in five parts by weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (In 1896 and 1897 Dr. A. M. Cushing wrote several\r\n     articles on this new remedy, and among them the\r\n     following, which appeared in the _Homoeopathic\r\n     Recorder_, 1897.)\r\n\r\nWhile making a proving of the above remedy I felt a sudden curious\r\nsensation in the region of the heart, and immediately felt of my pulse\r\nand found it _very weak and fluttering_. I have been asked what that\r\nsensation was, but I can't describe it, for, to tell the truth, I\r\nbelieve I was frightened and failed to remember it. Although it is\r\nunpleasant to be badly frightened, the nice results I have seen from the\r\nuse of the remedy and the kind words I have received from the\r\nprofession in regard to it has more than paid for the little fright. As\r\nso little is known of the remedy, I wish to report one case that was not\r\nat all indicated by the proving and two cases under the care of an old\r\nschool doctor. My case was that of a lady aged about forty, who for two\r\nyears was under the care of a homoeopathic doctor for some trouble, I\r\ndon't know what; then two years under the care of another homoeopathic\r\ndoctor for a fibroid of the uterus. She had twice consulted a specialist\r\nin Boston, who said it could not be removed. Then she came under my care\r\nwith a fibroid as large as a fetus at full term. Suffice it to say, I\r\ngave remedies in a higher attenuation than I believed she had taken, and\r\nin a few months the tumor had greatly diminished and gave her no\r\ntrouble. Still she was nervous and had neuralgic pains almost all over\r\nher. As remedies did not seem to relieve her for any length of time, I\r\ndecided to give her _Phaseolus_ 9x, as it probably would do as well as\r\nwhat I had given her. The next time I called she met me with \"I want a\r\nwhole bottle like what you gave me last.\" She does not have to take any\r\nmedicine now.\r\n\r\nI was called in consultation with an old school doctor to a case of\r\nconfinement. Patient, 26; first child; had been in pain forty-eight\r\nhours, but not severe till the last twelve hours. Patient, fleshy; urine\r\nheavily loaded with albumen. I knew that trouble was ahead, as she\r\nbecame blind. I found the head jacked firmly in the superior straits,\r\nface presentation which I could not change. I decided to wait a little,\r\nhelp what I could and watch the results. In a little while she went to\r\nsleep, the first quiet sleep in forty-eight hours; but when she moved it\r\nwas in a fearful convulsion. I expected the convulsions, but felt that\r\nif I applied the forceps, before they appeared some might say if he had\r\nlet her alone she would not have had them. I immediately turned her upon\r\nher left side, well covered up, and adjusted my forceps and soon had the\r\nhead through the bony parts; and as it is my custom to remove the\r\nforceps till the soft parts are dilated to prevent rupture I commenced\r\nto do so, when a fearful expulsive convulsion threw forceps and a\r\nthirteen-pound child into the bed with a complete rupture of the\r\nperineum--my first such case in forty-one years. While she was\r\nunconscious I took the necessary stitches, the doctor attending to the\r\nmedical part. One hour later, when I was in the kitchen helping the\r\nnurse and a few damsels dress the baby, the doctor came to me and said\r\nher heart was failing in its action fast. I gave him a vial of No. 25\r\nglobules medicated with 9x _Phaseolus_, and told him to give her a dose\r\nabout the size of a bean (being a bean remedy). Ten minutes later he\r\nsaid: \"That is wonderful, her heart is all right.\" Three times during\r\nthe night he had to repeat it with the same results. Afterwards she had\r\nno trouble.\r\n\r\nOne week later the same doctor came to me saying: \"I want a bottle of\r\nthat remedy.\" Yesterday I was called to see a lady who was unconscious,\r\npulseless, breathing ten times a minute, beyond hope as I supposed. I\r\ngave her three doses of _Phaseolus_, and she is all right.\r\n\r\nP. S.--If not too late, I would like to add a little to the paper I sent\r\nyou not long ago. The same old school doctor to whom I referred in that\r\npaper tells me he has used _Phaseolus_ in another case of heart disease\r\nwith a success similar to the others reported.\r\n\r\nA few weeks since a lady aged 50, nurse by profession, came to me\r\nsaying, at times, she had fearful time with her heart palpitating and\r\nfeeling as if she should die. Being in great haste, I made no\r\nexamination, but gave her a vial of _Phaseolus_ 15x to take a dose three\r\nor four times a day, as needed. Yesterday she called, saying she was\r\ngoing out of the city, but did not dare to go without some more of the\r\nmedicine, for she _never took anything in her life that did so much good\r\nas that_.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Cushing also read the following paper before the\r\n     Massachusetts Homoeopathic Medical Society, which we\r\n     take from the _New England Medical Gazette_. January,\r\n     1897:)\r\n\r\nBy request I appear before you to-day, and I presume you will be\r\ndisappointed if my paper is not on some new remedy; and such it is,--a\r\nremedy, I think, worthy the careful investigation of every\r\nhomoeopathic physician,--phaseolus nana, or the common white bean. It\r\nis unnecessary for me to say to you that Boston is called a bean-eating\r\ncity, or refer to the many sudden deaths there or in its vicinity from\r\nbrain or heart trouble, nor how in a certain way young men grow old. Can\r\nyou tell me the cause? I shall not take the time to report the proving I\r\nmade, nor why I began it, nor how I prepared it, nor its wonderful\r\neffects upon the nervous system, the genital organs, stomach, bowels, or\r\nkidneys, in the provings, referring only to three symptoms. A medical\r\nstudent has made a short but interesting proving of the remedy,\r\nconfirming some of my symptoms. While my proving was going on nicely, I\r\nsuddenly felt a curious sensation in the region of the heart. It was so\r\nsudden and strange I immediately felt of my pulse and found it very\r\nirregular and feeble, so much so I think I was frightened, at least I\r\ndid not take any more of the medicine. Never before had I had any\r\nirregular action of the heart. Soon after, I read that foreign\r\nphysicians were using a decoction of the growing bean and pod for\r\ndropsy.\r\n\r\nAbout that time I was called to see a hopeless case of uterine cancer\r\nwith severe general dropsy. I prescribed the best I knew and decided to\r\ntry the bean remedy. Several days elapsed before I could get any, and\r\nthen only the dry pods, as it was in December. I steeped them and gave\r\nit with apparent relief. I report this case more especially to speak of\r\nthe final result. I called one day expecting to find her quite\r\ncomfortable, but found her dead. She suddenly screamed, \"Oh, my head!\"\r\ngrasped it with both hands and was dead.\r\n\r\nMonths later, after an experience with another patient which I will\r\nreport later, it suddenly dawned upon me that possibly the bean\r\ndecoction might have hastened her death.\r\n\r\nI was called to see a man about forty-five, suffering from general\r\ndropsy with heart and other complications, who had been under the care\r\nof a homoeopathic physician some time. Although he had taken\r\n_Digitalis_, _Strophanthus_, _Strychnia_, _Nitroglycerine_, salts, etc.,\r\nhe had been unable to lie down for two weeks. I prescribed for him, but\r\nas soon as I could I prepared and gave him the bean-pod decoction. In\r\nabout one week he was able to lie down in bed, and his legs, which at my\r\nfirst visit measured over twenty-one inches in circumference, measured\r\nfifteen inches. Then hay fever appeared, and by the advice of nineteen\r\nor twenty-five women an old-school expert from New York was called and I\r\nwas left out.\r\n\r\nThe following cases, having symptoms similar to those developed in the\r\nproving, were given the same preparations as those used in the proving.\r\n\r\nA man aged sixty-nine, a retired clergyman on account of a heart disease\r\nthat had troubled him many years, yet no physician had been able to\r\nsatisfactorily diagnose, came home from a trip where he had unwisely\r\npreached twice, greatly exhausted. The heart's action was weak and\r\nirregular, growing weaker each day for a few days, when he was entirely\r\npulseless at both wrists, which continued four days in spite of my best\r\nefforts. I then gave him _Phaseolus_ 9x, and in a few hours there was an\r\nimprovement, and in thirty-six hours his pulse was regular and strong,\r\nabout seventy per minute; and it remained so till my last visit,\r\none-half hour before his death, two weeks after beginning the medicine.\r\nI was called to New York and returned too late to make a _post-mortem_\r\nexamination. Among his children were a public school teacher and a\r\ncollege professor. I told them what I was giving, and they watched the\r\ncase very closely and were surprised at its effects. Later they asked me\r\nif I would send some of the same medicine to a friend in Connecticut\r\nwho had no money but a bad heart, said by the doctor there and an\r\nexpert in Boston to be a weak heart. I sent the medicine and two weeks\r\nlater they wrote: \"His breath is not as short, his limbs were not as\r\nbadly swollen, could walk and sleep better, but they did not know as he\r\nwas any better.\" I sent more medicine and have not heard from that.\r\n\r\nA lady living in the West, aged about fifty, had been ailing several\r\nyears. Her greatest complaint was a weak, bad-aching heart. I treated\r\nher a few months with general improvement, but she complained of a weak,\r\ntired, bad-acting and bad-feeling heart. I sent her _Phaseolus_ 9x, and\r\nlater she wrote me that forty-eight hours after commencing the last\r\nmedicine sent her heart wheeled into line all right and remains so.\r\n\r\nA lady, aged eighty-seven, had diarrhoea, which was soon relieved;\r\nthen I found her heart acted badly, about every third beat omitted, and\r\nshe said it had been so for a year or more. I gave her _Phaseolus_, and\r\ntwo days later her pulse was all right.\r\n\r\nDr. Brown, of Springfield, reported a case of a young man that only once\r\nin two weeks did he get his pulse up to sixty, ranging from fifty to\r\nfifty-five the two weeks. He gave _Phaseolus_ 6, which I furnished him,\r\nand the next forenoon his pulse was seventy-two and remained so.\r\n\r\nI will report only one more case, treated with this remedy, one which I\r\nthink very interesting.\r\n\r\nA lady physician, aged thirty, married, no children, never has been sick\r\nexcept with childhood diseases. Two years ago had considerable mental\r\ntrouble and rode a bicycle a good deal. Since that time, two years ago,\r\nfive times each minute, or about that, her heart would give one hard\r\nunpleasant throb, then omit one beat, this in the day time, but much\r\nworse at night, preventing sleep. Being in somewhat of a hurry, I did\r\nnot examine the heart, thinking there would be a plenty of time later,\r\nbut gave her _Phaseolus_, the 10th I think. Thirty-six hours later the\r\nheart would beat one hundred consecutive times without the slightest\r\nvariation, and it continued to improve, although after taking the\r\nmedicine thirty-six hours she was obliged to desist on account of a\r\nsevere headache. She is never subject to headaches, but it was so bad\r\nshe dared not take any more of the medicine. It was as if something was\r\npressing hard against each temple, much worse soon after taking each\r\ndose of the medicine. This headache led me to fear that the death I\r\nmentioned might have been hastened by the medicine.\r\n\r\nA medical conundrum. A lady, aged about thirty, decided she would\r\ninvestigate the next world to see if she could enjoy it better than\r\nthis, and called in the aid of morphine to help her along. Not being in\r\nthe habit of taking morphine, to disguise the bitter of it, placed a\r\ntablet of morphine in the middle of a baked bean and swallowed it whole.\r\nShe took her little dose in the evening, having eaten nothing since\r\nnoon, and went to sleep. At seven in the morning she awoke and was\r\nsurprised to find herself in this world. When asked if she would get up,\r\nreplied, no, she would sleep a little longer. At eleven A.M. she awoke\r\nand tried to get up, but could not walk, so crawled to the door and\r\nopened it to let in fresh air. A servant found her there, and at her\r\nrequest handed her the camphor bottle, and she took a little. Dr. Rowe\r\nwas called and said she vomited a little mucus, some dark specks that\r\nlooked like blood, and a small piece of lettuce she ate the noon before.\r\nShe had taken twelve and one-half grains of morphine. Did the lettuce\r\nantidote it? Did the bean destroy its power? Why did it not kill her?\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTHOS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Araceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Skunk Cabbage.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh root gathered in spring is macerated in twice\r\nits weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Contributed by Dr. S. A. Jones to the _Homoeopathic\r\n     Recorder_, 1889.)\r\n\r\nThis perennial, odorous member of the natural order _Araceae_ is one of\r\nour most common meadow and bog plants. From its very realistic,\r\nskunk-like odor when cut or bruised, and its resemblance in shape of\r\nleaf and mode of growth to the cabbage, it has been commonly well known\r\nas the skunk cabbage.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the same family as the Calla lily and Indian turnip, the\r\nshape of its flower becomes at once familiar to anyone who observes it.\r\nAmong the first plants to flower in spring is this species, and by\r\nclosely observing the surface of any boggy meadow in the latter part of\r\nMarch or early April one will find irrupting the earth like mushroom the\r\npoints of many beautiful spathes gaping open to extend invitations to\r\nthe earliest slugs and carrion beetles of the season. These are the\r\nflowers of Pothos appearing some time before the leaves, and when\r\ndivested of the mud that clings to them, and polished with a damp cloth,\r\nas the apple-woman serves her pippins, they shine out in beautiful\r\nmottled purple, orange, and deep red, and, being very fleshy, will keep\r\nup appearances many days if cut deep and placed in hyacinth jars.\r\n\r\nThe root is large, thick, and cylindrical, giving off its lower end\r\nnumerous long, cylindrical branches; the leaves which appear on the\r\nfertilization of the ovary are large, smooth, entire, and deeply plaited\r\ninto rounded folds. On opening the pointed spathe or floral envelope, a\r\nclub-like mass will be noted arising from its base. This is the spadix\r\nbearing the naked flowers, which are perfect, consisting of a\r\nfour-angled style and four awl-shaped stamens. The fruit, when mature,\r\nis a globular, ill-smelling, glutinous mass, consisting of the enlarged,\r\nfleshy spadix and changed perianths, and enclosing several large\r\nbullet-like seeds.\r\n\r\nThe roots are easily gathered, one alone being sufficient to make a\r\nyear's stock of tincture for the most lavish practitioner.\r\n\r\nTHE TINCTURE.\r\n\r\nTake the fresh root stalks and rootlets, gathered in spring on the first\r\nappearance of the flowers, and chop and pound them to a pulp, and weigh.\r\nThen taking two parts, by weight, of alcohol, mix the pulp with\r\none-sixth part of it, add the balance, and, after stirring the whole\r\nwell, pour it into a well-stoppered bottle and let it stand for eight\r\ndays in a dark, cool place. After straining and filtering, the resulting\r\ntincture should be of a light brown color and have a slightly acrid\r\ntaste and a neutral reaction.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nThe active principle of this plant is doubtless volatile, as the dried\r\nroot presents none of the acridity of the fresh, and is odorless as\r\nwell. Dr. J. M. Turner determined in the root a volatile fatty body, a\r\nvolatile oil, a fixed oil, and a specific resin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of December, 1887, there came into my hands a case that the\r\nfamily physician (a homoeopath) had pronounced epilepsy and declared\r\nincurable. Upon being consulted, his diagnosis had been confirmed and\r\nhis prognosis corroborated by the late Prof. E. S. Dunster, of the\r\nUniversity of Michigan.\r\n\r\nUp to date that identical patient has had neither a \"fit\" nor any\r\napproximation thereto, and that fact is an occasion of this paper. One\r\nwho already discerns the first gray shadows of that night which comes to\r\nall, does not now write at the urging, or the _itching_, of the Ego. He\r\ndisclaims any merit, having evinced only a monkey-like imitativeness. He\r\nhad from the Infinite, the gift of a good memory, and an old book,\r\npicked up one happy day at a street stall, flashed into recollection\r\nsome twelve years later, and enabled him then to imitate the much\r\nearlier doing of its worthy author--\r\n\r\n  \"Only the actions of the just\r\n  Smell sweet and blossom in the dust.\"\r\n\r\nThis dead worthy--he that was James Thacher, M. D.--more than any other,\r\nmade known the virtues of _Pothos foetida_, and gratitude for what his\r\nbook had taught me to do made me feel that to write up this forgotten\r\nremedy were the fittest return that I could make for his well doing.\r\n\r\nA second incentive, ample enough, is found in the fact that the first\r\nhomoeopathic paper on _Pothos foet._ has never had a faithful\r\ntranslation into our language, and has not been critically reproduced in\r\nany other. A study of the _Homoeopathic Bibliography_, as given in\r\nthis paper, will teach an impressive lesson not only to the _real_\r\nstudent of Materia Medica, but also to those who assume the\r\nresponsibilities of editorship.\r\n\r\nA third inducement, and perhaps a pardonable, is the singular fact that\r\nmuch search in our literature has not enabled me to find any assistance\r\nof the clinical application of _Pothos foet._ by a homoeopathic\r\npractitioner. If any reader knows of any such, he will greatly gratify\r\nthe writer by making it known.\r\n\r\nAN EMPIRICAL BIBLIOGRAPHY.[K]\r\n\r\n    [K] As my researches are confined to my own library, I do not\r\n    profess to be exhaustive.

It\r\nbrings them face to face with the reader, and is as if one brushed the\r\nmoss from their gravestones, or perhaps, like Old Mortality, carved\r\nafresh a half-obliterated name.\r\n\r\nIt is not the briefest way, but it has the merit of showing from whence\r\nthe bricks came of which the edifice is built. I shall, then, cite the\r\nauthorities in chronological order, and copiously enough to include\r\nessentials.\r\n\r\n_Cutler._--The roots dried and powdered are an excellent medicine in\r\nasthmatic cases, and often give relief when other means are ineffectual.\r\nIt may be given with safety to children as well as to adults; to the\r\nformer, in doses of four, five or six grains, and to the latter in doses\r\nof twenty grains and upwards. It is given in the fit, and repeated as\r\nthe case may require. This knowledge is said to have been obtained from\r\nthe Indians, who, it is likewise said, repeat the dose, after the\r\nparoxysm (_sic_) is gone off, several mornings, then miss as many, and\r\nrepeat it again; thus continuing the medicine until the patient is\r\nperfectly recovered. It appears to be anti-spasmodic, and bids fair to\r\nbe useful in many other disorders.--_Op. cit._, 1,409.\r\n\r\n_Schoepf._--I am obliged to cite at second hand, as I have never been\r\nable to find a copy of his _opus_. One may judge of its rarity, when a\r\nforeign advertisement by a German bookseller some years since failed to\r\nobtain it for me.\r\n\r\nProf. W. P. C. Barton, _op. cit._, gives the gist of the Hessian\r\nsurgeon's contribution in a style and manner as prim and orderly as that\r\nof Surgeon Schoepf himself on a dress parade.\r\n\r\n  \"Pharm. _Dracontii Radix._\r\n  Qual. _Acris_, _alliacea_, _nauseosa_.\r\n  Vis. _Incidens_, _califaciens_, _expectorans_.\r\n  Usus: _fol. contrita ad vulnera recentia et ulcera._\r\n        _Tussis consumptiva._ _Scorbutus et elii morbi radix._\r\n        _Ari officin. utilis._\"\r\n\r\n\"Incidens\": Young reader, you must go back more than a century to\r\nunderstand the \"pathology\" that is wrapped up in that word like a mummy\r\nin its cerements. Don't laugh at _that_ \"pathology,\" for some graceless\r\ngraduate will laugh at yours in 1989. Note, however, in passing, that\r\nSchoepf says nothing, save _tussis_, that suggests the _vis\r\nanti-spasmodica_ of Cutler.\r\n\r\n_Thacher._--The roots and seeds, when fresh, impart to the mouth a\r\nsensation of pungency and acrimony similar to Arum.\r\n\r\nIt may be ranked high as an anti-spasmodic, experience having evinced\r\nthat it is not inferior to the most esteemed remedies of that class. In\r\ncases of asthmatic affections, it alleviates the most distressing\r\nsymptoms, and shortens the duration of the paroxysms. * * * Rev. Dr.\r\nCutler experienced in his own particular case very considerable relief\r\nfrom this medicine, after others had disappointed his expectations. * *\r\n* The seeds of this plant are said by some to afford more relief in\r\nasthmatic cases than the root.\r\n\r\nIn obstinate hysteric affections this medicine has surpassed in efficacy\r\nall those anti-spasmodics which have generally been employed, and in\r\nseveral instances it has displayed its powers like a charm. In one of\r\nthe most violent hysteric cases I ever met with, says a correspondent,\r\nwhere the usual anti-spasmodics, and even musk had failed, two\r\nteaspoonfuls of the powdered root procured immediate relief; and on\r\nrepeating the trials with the same patient, it afforded more lasting\r\nbenefit than any other medicine. In those spasmodic affections of the\r\nabdominal muscles during parturition, or after delivery, this root has\r\nproved an effectual remedy. In chronic rheumatism, and erratic pains of\r\na spasmodic nature, it often performs a cure, or affords essential\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nIt has in some cases of epilepsy suspended the fits, and greatly\r\nalleviated the symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn whooping cough, and other pulmonic affections, it proves beneficial\r\nin the form of syrup.\r\n\r\nDuring every stage of nervous and hysteric complaints, and in cramps and\r\nspasms, this medicine is strongly recommended as a valuable substitute\r\nfor the various anti-spasmodic remedies commonly employed. It is free\r\nfrom the heating and constipating qualities of Opium. [Yet Schoepf\r\nendowed it with the _vis colifaciers_.]\r\n\r\nHaving in a few instances tested its virtues in subsultus tendinum,\r\nattending typhus fever, its pleasing effects will encourage the future\r\nemployment of it in similar cases.\r\n\r\nTwo instances have been related in which this medicine has been supposed\r\nto be remarkably efficacious in the cure of dropsy.\r\n\r\nThe roots should be taken up in the autumn or spring, before the leaves\r\nappear, and carefully dried for use. Its strength is impaired by long\r\nkeeping, especially in a powdered state.--_Mat. Med._, 4th ed., p. 249.\r\n\r\nA young woman, about eighteen years of age, was harassed by severe\r\nconvulsive and hysteric paroxysms, almost incessantly, insomuch that her\r\nfriends estimated the number at seven hundred in the course of a few\r\nweeks; her abdomen was remarkably tumefied and tense, and there was a\r\nsingular bloatedness of the whole surface of her body, and the slightest\r\ntouch would occasion intolerable pain. At length her extremities became\r\nrigid and immovable (_sic_), and her jaw was so completely locked that\r\nshe was unable to articulate, and liquids could only be introduced\r\nthrough the vacuity of a lost tooth. She had been treated with a variety\r\nof anti-spasmodic and other medicines, by an experienced physician,\r\nwithout relief. Having prepared a strong infusion of the dried root of\r\nskunk cabbage, I directed half a teacupful to be given every few hours,\r\nwithout any other medicine; the favorable effects of which were soon\r\nobservable, and by persisting in the use of it about ten days the\r\nmuscular contractions were removed, the jaw was relaxed, and her faculty\r\nof speech and swallowing, with the use of all her limbs, were completely\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nAnother young woman had been exercised with the most distressing\r\nparoxysms of hysteria for several days, without obtaining relief by the\r\nmedicines prescribed, when the skunk cabbage infusion was so\r\nsuccessfully directed that her fits were immediately arrested, and in a\r\nfew days a cure was completely effected.\r\n\r\nThe brother of this patient was seized with violent convulsions of the\r\nwhole body, in consequence of a cut on his foot; the skunk cabbage was\r\nadministered, and he was speedily restored to perfect health.\r\n\r\nA woman was affected with violent spasmodic pains, twenty-four hours\r\nafter parturition; six doses of skunk cabbage entirely removed her\r\ncomplaints.--_American Modern Practice_, p. 530.\r\n\r\n_Barton._--The smell from spathe and flowers is pungent and very subtle.\r\nExperience leads me to believe they possess a great share of acridity;\r\n_having been seized with a very violent inflammation of my eyes_ (for\r\nthe first time in my life), which deprived me of the use of them for a\r\nmonth, by making the original drawings of these plates. The pungency of\r\nthe plant was probably concentrated by the closeness of the room, in\r\nwhich many specimens were at the time shut up.--_Veg. Mat. Med._, 1,\r\n128. [The italics are not in the original text.]\r\n\r\nThe seeds are said to afford more relief in asthmatic cases than the\r\nroot; and this I believe very probable, for they are remarkably active,\r\npungent, and, as has before been mentioned, exhale the odor of\r\nAsafoetida.--_Op. cit._, p. 131.\r\n\r\nThe bruised leaves are frequently applied to ulcers and recent wounds,\r\nand, it is said, with good effect. They are also used as an external\r\napplication in cutaneous affections; and I have heard of the expressed\r\njuice being successfully applied to different species of herpes. The\r\nleaves are also used in the country to dress blisters, with the view of\r\npromoting their discharge. * * * For this purpose I can recommend them\r\nwhere it is desirable to promote a large and speedy discharge, and no\r\nstimulating ointment is at hand.\r\n\r\n_Colden_ recommends the skunk cabbage in scurvy.--_Op. cit._, p. 132.\r\n\r\n_Bigelow._--The odor of the Ictodes resides in a principle which is\r\nextremely volatile. I have not been able to separate it by distillation\r\nfrom any part of the plant, the decoction and the distilled water being\r\nin my experiments but slightly impregnated with its sensible character.\r\nAlcohol, digested on the plant, retains its odors for a time, but this\r\nis soon dissipated by exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nAn acrid principle resides in the root, even when perfectly dry,\r\nproducing an effect like that of the Arum and the Ranunculi. When chewed\r\nin the mouth, the root is slow in manifesting its peculiar taste; but\r\nafter some moments a pricking sensation is felt, which soon amounts to a\r\ndisagreeable smarting, and continues for some time. This acrimony is\r\nreadily dissipated by heat. The decoction retains none of it. The\r\ndistilled water is impregnated with it, if the process be carefully\r\nconducted, but loses it on standing a short time.--_Amer. Med. Bot._, 2,\r\n45.\r\n\r\nTo insure a tolerably uniform activity of this medicine, the root should\r\nbe kept in dried slices, and not reduced to powder until it is wanted\r\nfor use.--_Op. cit._, p. 49.\r\n\r\nA number of cases have fallen under my own observation of the catarrhal\r\naffections of old people, in which a syrup prepared from the root in\r\nsubstance has alleviated and removed the complaint.--_Op. cit._, p. 48.\r\n\r\nIn delicate stomachs I have found it frequently to occasion vomiting\r\neven in a small quantity. In several cases of gastrodynia, where it was\r\ngiven with a view to its anti-spasmodic effect, it was ejected from the\r\nstomach more speedily than common cathartic medicines. I have known it\r\nin a dose of thirty grains to bring on not only vomiting, but headache\r\n(_sic_), vertigo and temporary blindness.--_Op. cit._, pp. 48-49.\r\n\r\n_Hand._--The root is a pungent anti-spasmodic in colics and griping of\r\nthe bowels.\r\n\r\nLeaves bruised relieve painful swellings, whitlows, etc.--_House Surg.\r\nand Phys._, p. 250.\r\n\r\n_Eberle._--In chronic cough attended with a cold, phlegmatic habit of\r\nbody, I have employed the powdered root of this plant with the most\r\ndecided benefit. In an old man who had been for many years afflicted\r\nwith a very troublesome cough and difficulty of breathing, I found\r\nnothing to give so much relief as this substance.\r\n\r\nIn cases of chronic catarrhal and asthmatic affections, and very\r\ngenerally with evident advantage.--_Mat. Med. and Thur._, 2, 154.\r\n\r\n_Ives._--The root loses its pungent taste, and appears to be nearly\r\ninert in a few weeks after it is gathered. I prepared, however, an\r\nalcoholic extract some years ago, by digesting the fresh roots and\r\nevaporating the tincture in the sun, which possessed and retained all\r\nthe acrimony of the recent root. The fresh leaves are actively\r\nrubefacient.--_Pharmacologia_, p. 147.\r\n\r\n_Smith._--Skunk cabbage is not only a good anti-spasmodic in all cases\r\nwhere such are indicated, but it is also a powerful emmenagogue,\r\nanthelmintic, and a valuable remedy in dropsy, in spasms, rheumatism,\r\npalpitations, etc. It is frequently used in childbed to promote the\r\nbirth. * * * * For expelling worms, the pulverized root should be\r\nadministered in molasses for a sufficient length of time, following it\r\nup with a purge.--_Op. cit._, p. 511.\r\n\r\n_Rafinesque._--Powerful anti-spasmodic, expectorant, incisive,\r\nvermifuge, menagogue, sudorific, etc. Used with success in spasmodic\r\nasthmas and coughs, hysterics, pertussis, epilepsy, dropsy, scurvy,\r\nchronic rheumatism, erradic and spasmodic pains, parturition,\r\namenorrhoea, worms, etc.--_Op. cit._, 2, 230.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HOMOEOPATHIC BIBLIOGRAPHY.[L]\r\n\r\n    [L] The definite article is used because it is believed to be\r\n    complete, thanks to the scholarship and courtesy of Dr. Henry\r\n    M.

Y.[M]\r\n\r\n    [M] Literalness rather than elegance has been sought in the\r\n    translating.\r\n\r\nBecause the odor is quite like Mephitis it is considered a so-called\r\nanti-spasmodic.\r\n\r\n_Abstract of symptoms from Hering, Humphreys, and Lingen._\r\n\r\nSo absent-minded and thoughtless that he enters the sick rooms without\r\nknocking; pays no attention to those speaking to him. Irritable,\r\ninclined to contradict; violent.\r\n\r\nHeadache of brief duration, in single spots, now here, now there, with\r\nconfusion. Pressure in both temples, harder on one side than on the\r\nother alternately, with violent pulsation of the temporal arteries.\r\n\r\nDrawing in the forehead in two lines from the frontal eminences to the\r\nglabella, where there is a strong outward drawing as if by a magnet.\r\n\r\nRed swelling, like a saddle, across the bridge of the nose, painful to\r\nthe touch, especially on the left side near the forehead, while the\r\ncartilaginous portion is cold and bloodless; with red spots on the\r\ncheek, on the left little pimples; swelling of the cervical and\r\nsub-maxillary glands.\r\n\r\nUnpleasant numb sensation in the tongue; cannot project it against the\r\nteeth; papillae elevated; tongue redder, with sore pain at point and\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nBurning sensation from the fauces down through the chest. With the\r\ndesire to smoke, tobacco tastes badly.\r\n\r\nPain in the scrobiculus cordis as if something broke loose, on stepping\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n_Inflation and tension in the abdomen_; bellyache here and there in\r\nsingle spots; on walking, feeling as if the bowels shook, without pain.\r\n\r\nStool earlier (in the morning), frequent, softer.\r\n\r\nUrging to urinate; very dark urine.\r\n\r\nPainful, voluptuous tickling in the whole of the glans penis.\r\n\r\nViolent sneezing, causing pain in the roof of the mouth, the fauces and\r\noesophagus all the way to the stomach, followed by long-continued\r\npains at the cardiac orifice.\r\n\r\nPain in chest and _mediastinum posticum_, less in the _anticum_, with\r\npain under the shoulders, which seems to be in connection with burning\r\nin the oesophagus. Pressing pain on the sternum.\r\n\r\nSudden feeling of anxiety, with difficult (or oppressed) respiration and\r\nsweat, followed by stool and the subsidence of these and other pains.\r\n\r\nInclination to take deep inspirations with hollow feeling in the chest,\r\nlater with contraction in the fauces and chest.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of breathing is better in the open air.\r\n\r\nPain in the crest of the right tibia.\r\n\r\nRheumatic troubles increased.\r\n\r\nSleepy early in the evening.\r\n\r\nAll troubles disappear in the open air.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to analyze this \"abstract of symptoms,\" to see if the\r\ninternal evidence tends to show that the recorded effects are genuine\r\nresults of the drug, it is well to remember that these provings--for we\r\ninfer that three observers participated therein--were made in the light\r\nof the empirical history of _Pothos foet._ The said history was on\r\nrecord before the date of these provings, and it cannot have escaped\r\nHering's eye; he was too wide a reader for that. He was, beyond doubt,\r\naware of the pathogenetic effects observed by Bigelow--_headache_,\r\n_vertigo_, _temporary blindness_, _vomiting_, _even from small\r\nquantities_. Having, then, this clue to its physiological action, these\r\nsymptoms should reappear in his proving _if his imagination furnished his\r\nsymptoms_. As only a mild headache is noted in the _Correspondenzblatt_,\r\nit is evident that these provers did not _work from a pattern_. It is\r\nalso evident that the _usus in morbis_ did not suggest the Allentown\r\nsymptomatology, for the anti-asthmatic virtue of _Pothos foet._ is one\r\nfeature on which the greatest stress had been laid, and yet the only\r\n_pathogenetic_ suggestion of its applicability in asthma is: \"_Sudden\r\nfeeling of anxiety with difficult_ (or oppressed) respiration and sweat,\r\nfollowed by stool and the _subsidence of these and other pains_.\" Who\r\never heard of an asthma relieved by stool? Who could have _invented_\r\nsuch an odd modality? As it stands it is an _unicum_, and by every rule\r\nof criticism this single symptom-group gives the stamp of verity to the\r\nAllentown \"abstract of symptoms.\" But there is other and singularly\r\nconvincing evidence of the genuineness of this abstract. As the reader\r\nis aware, Thacher had emphasized the efficiency of _Pothos foet._ as an\r\nanti-spasmodic in hysteria, although the \"key-note\" that indicates it in\r\nhysteria had wholly escaped his discernment.\r\n\r\nNow this very \"key-note\" appears in the Allentown pathogenesis, but so\r\nunobtrusively as to show most conclusively that the prover who furnished\r\nit did not recognize its singular import and value. Such testimony is\r\nabsolutely unimpugnable by honest and intelligent criticism.\r\n\r\nIt is also apparent that some of the less pronounced of its empirical\r\nvirtues are reflected in the proving. For instance, Thacher found it\r\nefficacious in \"erratick pains of a spasmodick nature.\" Is not this\r\n\"erratic\" feature reproduced in such conditions as:\r\n\r\n\"Headache, of brief duration, in single spots, now here, now there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pressure in both temples alternately, harder on one side than on the\r\nother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bellyache, here and there, in single spots?\"\r\n\r\nBrevity of duration and recurrence \"in single spots, now here, now\r\nthere,\" are phenomena at once _spasmodic_ and _erratic_. It must be\r\nadmitted that the trend of its pathogenetic action and the lines of its\r\ntherapeutical application are parallel, and, therefore, that the latter\r\nare confirmatory of the former.\r\n\r\nWith such an anti-hysterical reputation as the empirical use had given\r\nto _Pothos foet._, it might fairly be anticipated that its\r\npathogenesis would be distinguished by a paucity of objective _data_,\r\nfor only a tyro in pharmacodynamics, or a \"Regular,\" would expect to\r\nfind a full-lined picture of hysteria in any \"proving.\" And so we have\r\nin the \"abstract\" a flux of subjective symptoms, \"erratic\" enough for\r\nhysterical elements, and still further characterized by an apparent\r\nevanescence, as if its phenomena of sensory disturbance were as fleeting\r\nand unsubstantial as those of an hysterical storm.\r\n\r\nThe _will-o'-the-wisp-like_ character of its subjective symptoms, and\r\nits physometric property (hinted at in the pathogenesis and emphasized\r\nin Thacher's case) are the features that will chiefly impress one in\r\nstudying this distinctively American remedy.\r\n\r\nThat the \"abstract of symptomes\" evinces a cautious trial of this drug,\r\nand that more heroic experiments will add to our knowledge of its\r\npathogenetic properties, are plain deductions from the absence in the\r\n\"abstract\" of such pronounced effects as Bigelow observed and also from\r\nthe evidence of the _usus in morbis_. The remedy needs an efficient\r\nproving, especially in the female organism.\r\n\r\nAN APPLICATION OF POTHOS FOETIDA.\r\n\r\nMiss B----, aet. 20; a tall, spare brunette, and a good specimen of\r\nFothergill's _Arab type_, brainy and vivacious. General health has been\r\ngood, but she was never robust; could not go to school regularly.\r\nBetween her thirteenth and fifteenth years grew rapidly in stature, and\r\nthen she was easily wearied on walking; knees tired and limbs ached. Had\r\ngood digestion through the growing period, but subsequently became\r\nsubject to \"bloat of wind\" in abdomen. These meteoristic attacks came\r\nwhen lying down. A \"weight rises from the abdomen up to the heart.\" She\r\nmust at once spring up. This condition is relieved by eructating, by\r\nliquor, and by drinking hot water. The night attacks of meteorism are by\r\nfar the worst. _She is now subject to them._\r\n\r\n[Her grand-mother had such \"spells of bloating;\" would spring out of bed\r\nat night, lose consciousness, and \"bloat up suddenly.\" If she had such\r\nan attack when dressed, they had often been obliged to cut open her\r\nclothes.]\r\n\r\nPatient has found that apples, tomatoes, cabbage and onions disagree\r\nwith her; no other food. She is constipated--\"wants to and can't.\"\r\n\r\nHer hair is unusually dry; scalp full of dandruff; skin, generally, soft\r\nand flexible.\r\n\r\nShe has frequent epistaxis; has had four and five attacks a day. Blood\r\nbright red, \"runs a perfect stream,\" does not clot at the nostrils. Has\r\npreviously a \"heavy feeling\" in the head, which the bleeding relieves.\r\n\r\nIn appearance she is \"the picture of health;\" good complexion, fairly\r\nruddy cheeks, sparkling eyes--in a word, she is an incarnated protest\r\nagainst \"single blessedness.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of July, 1886, had her first \"fit.\" She had arisen\r\nwith a headache, which kept on increasing in severity. Just after a\r\nlight meal had the attack; \"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" and fell insensible.\r\nStiffened at first, then had clonic spasms. Neither bit the tongue nor\r\nfrothed at the mouth. No micturition or defecation. On coming to, did\r\nnot remember that she had fallen, but recollected being borne up stairs.\r\nHad a \"dreadful nosebleed\" after the attack. Left her very weak; could\r\nhardly lift her feet from the floor. Before the \"fit\" the headache had\r\nbecome unbearably severe.\r\n\r\nHad her second \"fit\" on August 7th, 1887. Headache came on and kept\r\ngrowing worse; was in temples, beating and throbbing, and in eyes,\r\n\"light hurt\"--also on vertex, \"pressing-down\" pain. At 4 P.M. suddenly\r\nfell down insensible. No cry. Tongue bitten. Slight frothing at the\r\nmouth. First \"stiff all over,\" then clonic spasms. After the \"fit\" knew\r\nthat something had happened to her. Was prostrated for nearly a month,\r\nbut not so much as after first attack.\r\n\r\nDecember 10th, 1887, third \"fit.\" On the night of the 9th her mother had\r\nbeen very ill, and she herself was very uneasy and alarmed. Had the\r\nattack before breakfast. Blurred vision, headache, fall; no biting of\r\ntongue, nor frothing. First rigid, then clonic spasms; after attack,\r\nnose bled profusely, head ached all day, face flushed and dark.\r\nProstrated as usual.\r\n\r\nIn none of the attacks was there any involuntary micturition or\r\ndefecation, nor was it ever necessary to use any force to hold her on\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\nOne other fact I gathered from her brother, namely: during her \"fits\"\r\nher abdomen bloated so rapidly and to such a degree that the family had\r\nlearned to remove her clothing as soon as possible after she fell.\r\n\r\nOf course, Thacher's case, wherein the \"abdomen was remarkably tumefied\r\nand tense,\" came into memory at once. The old volume was taken down, and\r\nthat case re-read. Then followed the _Encyclopaedia_, and then the\r\nEnglish _Symptomen Codex_. No pathogenetic light or corroboration\r\n_there_. Then Curie's \"Jahr.\" Ah! \"_Inflation and tension in the\r\nabdomen._\" Only a straw, but a pathogenetic, and I grasped it\r\nthankfully. I found also, \"_aching in the temples with violent arterial\r\npulsation_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an open winter; my son dug some skunk cabbage roots in a swamp; a\r\ntincture was made; ten-drop doses, four times daily, were taken until\r\nsix ounces had been consumed.\r\n\r\nNo \"fit\" up to date; no epistaxis; only once a slight headache.\r\n\r\nI never made a diagnosis in this case; have not reached one yet, nor am\r\nI grieving over that omission. I did rashly declare that it was not\r\nepilepsy, because Sauvages _tympanites intestinalis_ is a feature of\r\nhysteria, but not of epilepsy. But not a word of this was said to the\r\npatient. It was not a \"mind cure,\" for I have no \"mind\" to spare; nor\r\nwas it \"Christian science,\" for I am not up to that. I had an _amnesis_\r\nin which grand-mother and grand-daughter participated. Nature had put\r\nthe \"key-note\" in italics, not only in the patient but also in the drug.\r\nThacher stumbled upon it empirically; Hering found it pathogenetically,\r\nand that led to its application under the guidance of the only\r\napproximation to _a law_ in therapeutics that has yet been discovered by\r\nany of woman born: _similia similibus curantur_!\r\n\r\n     (Anent the foregoing paper Dr. W. C. Campbell sent the\r\n     following to the same journal:)\r\n\r\nPOTHOS FOETIDA, HYSTERIA.\r\n\r\nNovember 6, 1889, was called in haste to see Miss N----, aged 19 years.\r\nFound her lying upon the floor, exhibiting all the phenomena of\r\nepilepsy, clenched hands, frothing at the mouth, clonic spasm, etc.\r\n\r\nOn questioning the family, I learned that she had been subject to such\r\nseizures for about two years, and that they were increasing in\r\nfrequency. She had been dismissed from the various cotton mills in which\r\nshe had been employed because of them. The father had been informed that\r\nshe had epilepsy, and she had been treated accordingly by three old\r\nschool physicians.\r\n\r\nThe sister informed me that although she had frequently fallen near the\r\nstove she had never struck it. Further questioning elicited the fact of\r\nher never having injured herself more seriously than to bite her tongue.\r\nIt was then I became suspicious, and later felt convinced that it was\r\nhysteria and not epilepsy with which I had to deal.\r\n\r\nI remembered having read in _The Recorder_ an article by Dr. S. A.\r\nJones, of Ann Arbor, on _Pothos foetida_, with the record of a case in\r\nsome respects similar to mine. After again reading it up, I made a\r\ntincture of the roots and tendrils gathered at the time, of which I gave\r\nher a two drachm phial, directing her to take ten drops three times per\r\nday.\r\n\r\nOn the second day she had a slight seizure while at dinner. After two\r\nmonths she again resumed her place in the mill, where she has since been\r\nsteadily employed, and is strong and well in every way.\r\n\r\nHave used _Pothos_ in epilepsy, also in dropsy, with negative results.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMULA OBCONICA.\r\n\r\nNAT.

This is characteristic of the _Arsenicum_\r\neruption, also of _Anacardium_, _Rhus tox._, and some others. The\r\neruption also bears a strong resemblance to these remedies, and if one\r\nmay judge from the symptoms enumerated ought to prove a potent rival in\r\nerysipelas and eczematous complaints. _Rhus_ poisoning will no doubt\r\nfind a new and efficient remedy in _Primula_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPYRUS AMERICANA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Rosacae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Mountain ash.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh bark is macerated in twice its weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (We find the following in the _American Observer_, 1878,\r\n     credited to _Northwestern Analist_ and written by Dr. H.\r\n     P. Gatchell. Allen, in the _Encyclopaedia_ has not\r\n     mentioned the drug, and we can find no mention in any of\r\n     the dispensatories consulted. Dr. Fernie, in his\r\n     excellent book, _Herbal simples_ devotes some space to\r\n     it. We quote: \"'There is,' says an old writer, 'in every\r\n     berry the exhilaration of wine, and the satisfying of old\r\n     mead; and whosoever shall eat three berries of them, if\r\n     he has completed a hundred years, he will return to the\r\n     age of thirty.' At the same time it must be noted that\r\n     the _leaves_ of the Mountain ash are of a poisonous\r\n     quality, and contain prussic acid like those of the\r\n     laurel.\" The following is Dr. Gatchell's paper, the\r\n     proving, be it noted, is made from a tincture of the\r\n     bark:)\r\n\r\nMy memory of details, never remarkable, except as the details belonged\r\nto some system, is not as good as in earlier life, and in the matter of\r\ndisconnected or partially connected incidents, the widow Bedott could,\r\nat any time, have given me five points in ten, and then have beaten me\r\neasily.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 of the provers was a married lady; No. 2 and No. 3 were lads. The\r\ntincture of the bark was used, several drops being put in a cup of\r\nwater, of which teaspoonful doses were given and repeated at, I do not\r\nremember what, intervals. Myself experienced some irritation of the\r\neyes; no other symptoms.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Feels like crying. Feels as if the knees are immensely swollen,\r\nas if the toes the same. Knees and toes ache. Feels constricted around\r\nthe waist, obliged to loosen the clothes at once. Headache begins over\r\nthe eyes, left side of head aches terribly, like a tooth ache. Aches\r\neverywhere, in every joint. Left great toe feels as if torn from the\r\nsocket. Sense of prolapsus of womb, bearing down and pressing out, as if\r\nswollen, and burning all over. Pains in the head knife-like. All the\r\npains intense, acute. Thinks the conditions that of inflammatory\r\nrheumatism as if the lungs were congested, especially at the base. Can\r\nhardly breathe, as if cold water in the stomach. Thinks mucus\r\naccumulated in the cold stomach. Craves hot teas. Headache extends to\r\nthe right side. Head feels as if it would burst. Great weight on top of\r\nhead. Toes burn. Aching at heart. Twinging pains in arms, legs and toes.\r\nAs if rectum were shrunken, dried up. Bearing down pains and pressing\r\nout, like labor pains. Feels gloomy and discouraged, but can't cry. Very\r\ncold, shivers internally; thinks she must look blue. Cold creeping all\r\nover. Pain in knees subsides, and is succeeded by pain as in the tendons\r\nand along the calves. \"Oh, such a drawing pain, cutting and darting\r\nalso, like that in the head.\" Feels resolute, as full of a gloomy\r\ndetermination. Stomach cold again. Thinks meat bad for her, would not\r\ndigest; needs soft, mild food. Irritation of bladder and urethra; feels\r\nas if prolapsus of bladder. Dreads to move, especially on account of the\r\njoints. Sensitive to cold. Stomach still feels as if full of cold\r\nwater. Sick feeling under right scapula. Thinks bile deficient.\r\nShooting pains in forehead. Feeling as if coldness in stomach extends up\r\nunder the sternum. Same feeling in the gullet. Excessive aching of bones\r\nof toes; seems unendurable. Thinks the stomach very weak, as if it would\r\ndigest nothing; thinks it is dry and wrinkled. Hypochondriac, not\r\nnervous. Feels lazy, as if she would like to lie in bed and be waited\r\non. Selfish. Headache penetrating in temples. Thinks she is clairvoyant,\r\ncan read character and understand motions; can see into herself; thinks\r\nthe blood dark blue. Feels pains drawing, rending along posterior aspect\r\nof thighs and down to toes. Left side most affected. Feels as if the\r\nleft leg were drawn up, and would never straighten again. Pains seem to\r\nmove in meandering lines. Seems to be able to go out of herself for a\r\nshort distance, to walk around and return into the body. Thinks she is\r\nlooking down upon her own body. Seems to her that the fundus of the\r\nstomach is depressed in the abdomen, as if on fire at the pyloric end of\r\nstomach. Thinks there is a red spot there, looking like raw beef, as if\r\nthe stomach burnt up with raw whisky. Exclaims in a plaintive tone,\r\n\"Don't get out of patience with me\" (of which I had given no\r\nindications). Cries, feels babyish. Apprehension; fears something\r\nterrible is about to occur. Very chilly. Can't talk loud; voice gone.\r\nShe feels so weak, as if about to die. Moans and groans, calls for help.\r\nOppression about the heart, as if it had stopped beating, as going into\r\nconvulsions. Feels as if a spasm of the heart, tetanic. As if the blood\r\ntoo thick to circulate. Thinks she would have died but for the _Camphor_\r\nI gave her. Felt as she did when near dying of hemorrhage. Brain is\r\nactive, intellect clear, thoughts vivid, the whole being intensified.\r\nNext morning, sense of constriction at base of lungs. Some cough. Clammy\r\nfeeling of skin. Very sensitive to air.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Causes a glow all over, hands sweat. Some pain in finger joints.\r\nThroat feels obstructed. Some hoarseness. Dry cough, as if pharynx\r\nstuffed with cotton. It is an effort to talk. Tongue feels partially\r\nparalyzed, cannot direct it. Throws the paper down, has lost inclination\r\nto read. Feels indolent, indifferent. Feels chills when air strikes.\r\nSpasmodic breathing, like a nervous woman--silly, mystical. Pain in\r\nfinger joints continues. Feels like crying. Sad, weeping mood. Tears\r\nwill come. Eyes smart. Heart aches, as from some great sorrow. Eyes feel\r\nas if had been crying a long time, as if swollen, burning. Very\r\nsensitive to cold, easily chilled. Chills down the back and both legs.\r\nEnds with a very tranquil feeling, particularly of consciousness. Next\r\nmorning, tight feeling of patella. Joints all feel constricted and sore.\r\n\r\nNo. 3. Very chilly. Can't endure cold at all. Other symptoms not\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nIn all three, pains and chilliness much increased by moving about.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Subsequently her muscular condition was much improved. Her\r\nmuscles did not ache from work as formerly.\r\n\r\nA cut bled less freely than usual, bled scarcely any, and healed very\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALIX NIGRA AMENTS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Salicaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, White Willow.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh aments are macerated in twice their weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. John Fearns writes of this remedy in _Chicago\r\n     Medical Times_, 1896:)\r\n\r\nAt this writing I wish to speak not of the tonic and antiseptic\r\nproperties of this species of _Salix_, but of its usefulness as a\r\nsedative to the generative system. As a sedative on these lines I have\r\nhad very good results from its use.\r\n\r\nIn cases of acute gonorrhoea with much errotic trouble. Also in cases\r\nof chordee with great irritation; for these purposes I have given it in\r\ndoses of thirty to sixty drops on retiring, and repeat at midnight or\r\ntowards morning, if needed; in these cases nothing has given me more\r\nsatisfaction than this remedy. It answers the purpose, it robs night of\r\nits terrors, and it leaves no unpleasant consequences in its train.\r\n\r\nIn cases of excessive venereal desire, amounting to satyriasis, from\r\nexperience I would use this remedy first. I have seen it control the\r\nvenereal appetite in a very satisfactory manner. It can be given in\r\ncases where the bromides have always been considered appropriate, and it\r\ncan be given where the bromides would be very inappropriate and there is\r\nno reflex effect on the brain or nervous system.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALVIA OFFICINALIS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Labiatae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Common sage.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh leaves are macerated in twice their weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Although scarcely used in the present day sage runs back\r\n     in medical history to the Greeks, and, according to\r\n     Fernie, is still held in the highest esteem by country\r\n     people in many parts of Europe. Quoting Gerard: \"Sage is\r\n     singularly good for the head and brain; it quickeneth the\r\n     senses and memory; strengtheneth the sinews; restoreth\r\n     health to those that have palsy; and takes away shaky\r\n     trembling of the members.\" The following appeared in\r\n     _Echo Med. du Nord_, 1897, concerning this remedy:)\r\n\r\nThis remedy (in English, _Sage_) has been almost forgotten in modern\r\nmedical art, but still remains in high repute as a domestic medicine.\r\nLately, French physicians have called attention to it, and not only for\r\ngargling in cases of inflammation of the throat and for washing the\r\nmouth in affections of the gums, but more especially as an unfailing\r\nremedy for night-sweats in persons suffering from affections of the\r\nrespiratory organs. In the numerous experiments made with it, there\r\nwere never any disagreeable concomitant effects. On the contrary, it was\r\nfound that _Salvia_ acts even more favorably on the tickling coughs with\r\nconsumptives than _Belladonna_, _Rumex crispus_, etc., so that\r\npreparations of _Morphine_ and _Codeine_ could be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n_Salvia_ should be used in the form of the tincture, and, indeed, the\r\ntincture prepared from the fresh leaves and the blossom tips, as we find\r\nit in homoeopathic pharmacies. It should be given in doses of 20, 30,\r\nor 40 drops, in a tablespoonful of water. The effects manifest\r\nthemselves very quickly, two hours after taking a dose, and these\r\neffects persist for two to six days.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAURURUS CERNUUS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Piperaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Lizard's Tail.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The entire plant including the root is macerated in twice\r\nits weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following short notice of this almost unknown remedy\r\n     appeared in the _Homoeopathic Recorder_, 1895:)\r\n\r\nReaders who are interested in the remedies of nature rather than those\r\nproduced in the laboratory and sold under trademarks will remember that\r\nit was Dr. D. L. Phares, of Mississippi, who, over half a century ago,\r\npointed out the wonderful virtues of _Passiflora incarnata_, so much\r\nused to-day. What Dr. Phares said of the remedy laid dormant until Hale,\r\nin his ever perennial _New Remedies_, rescued it from the dusty pages of\r\nold medical journals, in which so much of value is buried awaiting\r\nresurrection. Among such buried remedies is _Saururus cernuus_ or, as it\r\nis more commonly known, \"lizard's tail.\" Dr. Phares, who seems to have\r\nbeen an unusually keen observer, used _Saururus cer._ in his practice,\r\nas he did _Passiflora_, for many years before he communicated his\r\nobservations to the medical journals, and the _Saururus_ seems to be\r\nquite as important and useful a remedy in its sphere as is _Passiflora_,\r\nand one quite as worthy of a thorough proving. In absence of proving it\r\nmay be said that Dr. Phares used it for years with marked success in all\r\nirritation and inflammation of the kidneys, bladder, prostate and\r\nurinary passages. He considered it peculiarly adapted to all such cases\r\nif they were attended by strangury, or painful and difficult urination.\r\nDr. Phares used the remedy both externally and internally and he found\r\nthat the stomach was very tolerant of the rather heroic doses he\r\nprescribed.\r\n\r\nThe plant is an indigenous perennial found in swampy localities, in some\r\nparts of the United States, and has been, and is still, used in domestic\r\npractice for those conditions for which Dr. Phares commends it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOLOPENDRA MORSITANS.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The insect is triturated with sugar of milk in the usual\r\nway.\r\n\r\n     (In the case of a man bitten in the arm by a centipede,\r\n     reported in _Nashville Journal of Medicine_, 1870, among\r\n     the striking symptoms was no perspiration in the arm for\r\n     three months. Dr. Sherman, of California (_Med.\r\n     Advance_), reports the following symptoms as prominent in\r\n     a woman bitten by a centipede:)\r\n\r\n_Head._--Vertigo, with blindness, worse in the morning.\r\n\r\n_Stomach._--Nausea and vomiting; unable to retain either food or liquid.\r\n\r\n_Back._--Terrible pains in back and loins, spasmodic and irregular, at\r\ntimes extending down the limbs. Pains returned every few days for three\r\nweeks, commencing in the head and going out at the toes. \"Resembled\r\nlabor pains as nearly as anything I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSCUTELLARIA LATERIFOLIA.\r\n\r\nNAT.

All the symptoms seem to be aggravated by work or\r\nexcitement and ameliorated by sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nSISYRINCHIUM.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Iridaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Blue-eyed grass.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh root is macerated in twice its weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. W. U. Reed, of Northmanchester, Ind., contributed\r\n     the following in 1892 to the _Hom. Recorder_, concerning\r\n     this little known remedy. _Sisyrinchium_ was one of the\r\n     old \"Thompsonians.\" From what Dr. Reed says of it the\r\n     remedy must be a very powerful one and worthy of full\r\n     investigation.)\r\n\r\nNumerous articles have appeared in our medical journals during the past\r\nfew months relative to the treatment of persons bitten by venomous\r\nreptiles, especially the rattlesnake. Whether the rattlesnakes found in\r\nthe marshes of Indiana are in any respect different from those found in\r\nOregon, or in the mountains of Pennsylvania, I do not know. The bite of\r\nthe Indiana rattler has been known to prove fatal to both man and beast.\r\nNotwithstanding we have growing in our woods and fields a small plant,\r\nwhich I believe to be a specific for the treatment of persons or animals\r\nbitten by the rattlesnake. From my own experience and observation in the\r\nuse of this remedy, I believe it to be a positive cure in all cases if\r\nexhibited in any reasonable time. I have never known it to fail in a\r\nsingle instance, even where the alcoholic treatment and many other kinds\r\nhad failed.\r\n\r\nThe plant referred to, the roots of which are used in the treatment of\r\nsnake bites; or a tincture made from the roots, is the _Sisyrinchium_ of\r\nthe _Iris_ family, I think, and is said to have been used by the Indians\r\nin treating snake bites, by bruising and moistening the roots and\r\napplying to the wound. I am not aware of its ever having been used as a\r\nmedicine by the profession, and, so far as I know, I am the first to\r\nprepare and use it in the form of a tincture. By your kind permission I\r\nwill report, through the columns of your valuable journal, a few cases\r\ntreated by this remedy, which for convenience I will call\r\n_Sisyrinchium_.\r\n\r\nCase 1. Bessie A., aged six years, while playing in the yard on a farm,\r\nsome twelve miles in the country, was bitten in the hand by a\r\nrattlesnake which was killed a moment after by the mother of the little\r\ngirl who was attracted by the screams of the child. Sixteen hours after\r\nI arrived, everything having been done in the meantime that had ever\r\nbeen heard of by the parents, even to poulticing the wound with entrails\r\nof a black chicken. The little sufferer was, indeed, an object of pity.\r\nThe hand and arm were swollen almost to bursting, the swelling extending\r\nto the shoulder and spine, being of a bluish black color as if\r\ndreadfully bruised. This discoloration extended over the back to the\r\nhips. Skin hot and dry, face flushed, pulse quick and hard. Child\r\nunconscious. I felt that the case was hopeless. But through the earnest\r\nentreaties of the mother, I proceeded to do what I could. Saturating a\r\npiece of cotton with the tincture I had prepared, I bound it on the\r\nwound; then dropping twelve drops in a glass of water I directed that a\r\nteaspoonful be given every hour, the compress to be renewed every hour\r\nalso, until my return. I confess I had little hope of seeing my little\r\npatient alive again, but on my return the following day I was much\r\nrejoiced to find a decided change for the better in the condition of the\r\nlittle sufferer. The swelling was not nearly so tense, the fever had\r\nsubsided, the delirium gone, and the danger seemed past. The treatment\r\nwas continued, and a speedy and permanent recovery followed.\r\n\r\nCase 2. Burt Whitten, aged ten, while out in a marsh with a number of\r\nolder boys gathering huckleberries, was bitten in the right ankle by a\r\nrattler. He was so frightened when he saw the snake, as it bit him, that\r\nhe ran all the way home, a distance of nearly a mile; although the day\r\nwas very hot. This patient came to my hands after the usual alcoholic\r\ntreatment for twenty-four hours by an Allopathic physician, with the\r\npatient growing worse all the time. I found this patient in about the\r\nsame condition as the first. The leg and foot were enormously swollen\r\nand of the same general appearance; the foot, calf of the leg and thigh\r\nwere black; the whole body was very red, hot and dry; face dark red;\r\npulse quick and hard; patient delirious but would cry out if touched.\r\nFifteen drops in a glass of water. Teaspoonful every hour, with cotton\r\nsaturated with the tincture applied to the wound. In this case the\r\nchange, I was informed by the father, was quite noticeable in two hours.\r\nThe boy had been in a wild delirium all night and up to the time he\r\nreceived the first dose of _Sisyrinchium_. After the second dose he\r\nbecame quiet, and in two hours the delirium had passed away. Under this\r\ntreatment the patient was able to be out on the streets again in four\r\ndays, though the discoloration did not disappear for some time after.\r\n\r\nMany more cases might be given where this remedy has been given to both\r\nman and beast with the same results.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKOOKUM CHUCK.\r\n\r\n     (Some readers may be startled at this name, applied to a\r\n     remedy, but under that name it came before the profession\r\n     and the name has stuck. It is the Western Indian's\r\n     designation of the waters of what is now known as\r\n     \"Medical Lake.\" The following by Dr. W. D. Gentry\r\n     appeared in the _U. S. Med. Investigator_, 1889:)\r\n\r\nThe water is of a deep amber and almost red in the sunlight. The\r\nfollowing is an analysis of the salts, obtained by evaporation of the\r\nwater; the proportion being in grains per U. S. gallon 231 cubic inches:\r\n\r\n  Sodic chloride,                 16.370\r\n  Potassic chloride,               9.241\r\n  Sodic carbonate,                63.543\r\n  Magnesic carbonate,               .233\r\n  Ferrous carbonate,                .526\r\n  Calcic carbonate,                 .186\r\n  Aluminic oxide,                   .175\r\n  Sodic silicate,                 10.638\r\n  Organic matter,                   .551\r\n                                  ------\r\n                                 101.463\r\n  Lithic carbonate,             }\r\n  Potassic sulphate,            }Each a trace.\r\n  Sodic bi-borate,              }\r\n\r\nThe lake has no outlet, but is fed by two enormous springs. It contains\r\nno living things with the exception of axolotl, a kind of salamander,\r\nsuch as are found in the lakes of the Mexican Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nThe medical and curative properties of this remarkable lake was known to\r\nthe Indians of the northwest as far back as they have any legends or\r\ntribal history, and it was held in such reverence by them that the\r\ncountry around this lake was called 'Sahala Lyee Illihe,' or 'Sacred\r\nGrounds,' and no matter how hostile the tribes were to each other no\r\nIndians journeying to or from the 'Skookum Limechen Chuck,' or 'strong\r\nmedicine water,' were ever molested.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians were considering the transfer of their lands to the\r\ngovernment, many years ago, it is recorded as a matter of history, that\r\nold Quetahlguin, father of the present Chief Moses, and 'Old Joseph,'\r\nfather of Chief Joseph, lately a prisoner of war, with the broken\r\nremnants of his band, after weeks of deliberation and consideration,\r\nwith the 'Sahala Lyee,' or Great Spirit, through their medicine-men, or\r\nprophets, firmly said: 'We have talked with the Great Spirit and we have\r\nslept with his words in our ears. The Great Spirit is our father and the\r\nearth is our mother. We have a good home and it was made for us by the\r\nGreat Spirit; it is a part of us; it is our mother. In Wallowa Lake are\r\nan abundance of fish created especially for our tribe. None other of his\r\nred children have such fish. In the 'Skookum Chuck' we have a remedy for\r\nall our ailments. We only have to bathe in and drink its water and we\r\nare made well. If we sign the treaty we will forever offend the Great\r\nSpirit; we will sign away our mother and she will cry. Her tears will\r\ndry up these lakes and we will be hungry and sick. We will go to the\r\nSkookum Chuck only to find that its waters have disappeared.'\r\n\r\nThe story is told of a Frenchman passing the lake many years ago, before\r\nthe properties of the water became known to the whites, with a drove of\r\nsheep afflicted with a skin disease called 'the scab.' As soon as the\r\nsheep saw the water they ran to it, but would not drink. They stood in\r\nthe water for some time, and in a few days they were well of the 'scab.'\r\nThe Frenchman was suffering with rheumatism. He concluded to try the\r\nwater of the lake for his disease. He was speedily cured. The whites\r\nwere soon attracted to this lake by the stories of marvellous cures\r\nreported by the Indians, and by seeing Indians return in health and\r\nvigor from the lake, who had been taken there on litters, appearing at\r\nthe point of death. It is estimated that over 20,000 people have visited\r\nthis lake since 'Joseph's Band' were driven from that section of the\r\ncountry, and it is fast becoming as popular as any other of our great\r\nhealth resorts.\r\n\r\nMy attention was called to _Skookum chuck_ some time since, and I\r\nprocured some of the salts and triturated a quantity, making the first,\r\nsecond, third and sixth potencies. I partially proved the first potency\r\nby taking two grains every two hours. The first effect produced was a\r\nprofuse coryza with constant sneezing, as in hay fever. This continued\r\nuntil the medicine was antidoted by tobacco. My appetite was greatly\r\nincreased. Some rheumatic pains in limbs, and heaviness about the\r\nsacrum. The catarrhal effects were so severe I could not continue the\r\nremedy. I have used the third and sixth potency in my practice and have\r\ncured a number of cases of catarrh, and am confident that the remedy\r\nwill be curative in hay fever.\r\n\r\n     (Later investigation, however, demonstrated that the\r\n     chief curative action of the salts was in skin diseases.\r\n     Dr. D. De Forest Cole, of Albion, N. Y., wrote the\r\n     following to the firm from whom he procured the remedy:)\r\n\r\nSome time since I received from you one bottle _Skookum chuck_ 3x trit.\r\nI had a very bad case of urticaria which resisted the usual remedies as\r\n_Apis_, _Urtica ur._, etc., and I gave her (a girl twelve years old)\r\nfour powders of about four grains each of the _Skookum chuck_,\r\ninstructing her to take one powder in one-half glass water, one\r\nteaspoonful every two hours, and she returned in a week free from any\r\nurticaria. I gave her four powders more, and no appearance of urticaria\r\nsince. Besides curing the urticaria the patient's health is in every way\r\nimproving. I write this thinking you might desire to know of its value\r\nin urticaria, as well as eczema.\r\n\r\n     (The following cases were contributed by Dr. D. W.\r\n     Ingalls, Bridgeport, to _N. Y. Med. Times_, 1894:)\r\n\r\nCASE 1. Mrs. D., aged forty-eight years, suffered four years with eczema\r\nplantaris, fissured, red and painful, which gave forth a viscid\r\nsecretion, drying into scales half an inch in thickness. For the past\r\ntwo years the patient had not been able to wear shoes nor walk any\r\ndistance, owing to the excessive soreness of the feet.\r\n\r\nPatient consulted me March 1st, and the following treatment was given:\r\nTwo-grain powders of the 2x trituration of _Skookum chuck_ every two\r\nhours, and an ointment applied nightly consisting of _Skookum salt_, one\r\ndrachm to the ounce of _Vaseline_. In the morning the feet were washed\r\nwith _Skookum chuck_ soap. April 1st the patient walked to the\r\ndispensary in felt shoes. The fissures and greenish tinge of the crusts\r\nhad nearly disappeared. The two-grain powders were then given every four\r\nhours and the former treatment continued. On May 1st, patient walked to\r\nthe dispensary wearing leather shoes for the first time, the ointment\r\nwas stopped, the fissures and crevices being hardly perceptible. The\r\npatient was advised to wash the feet night and morning with the _Skookum\r\nchuck_ soap.\r\n\r\nJune 1st patient presented herself, stating that she had very little\r\ntrouble with her feet, except some tenderness upon a misstep. Appearance\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nA powder of the 3x was given every night, together with the continued\r\nwashing of the feet night and morning. July 1st the patient was\r\ndischarged cured.\r\n\r\nCASE 2. Mrs. B., aged twenty-eight, eczema of the nose of one year's\r\nstanding. The usual ointments were given, but without result. March 15th\r\nthe following treatment was given: Five-grain powder of the 2x\r\ntrituration _Skookum chuck_ four times a day, together with the\r\n_Skookum_ ointment applied nightly. This case was entirely cured in six\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nCASE 3. Mrs. H., aged twenty-three, benign growth in left breast about\r\nthe size of a walnut; first noticed about eight months previously. Upon\r\nstrict inquiry, no history of cancer or tuberculosis was given.\r\nOne-grain powders of the 1x were given, the first week every four hours.\r\nTwo-grain powders of the 2x were given every four hours the second week.\r\nFive-grain powders of the 3x were given the third week and continued\r\nseven weeks, when the patient was discharged cured.\r\n\r\nCASE 4. Mr. S. was afflicted with eczema of the scalp, which spread from\r\nback of the ears to the eyebrows, covering the entire scalp with a\r\nsquamous or scabby eczema, accompanied with a constant itching and\r\nshedding of scales. On March 18th the following treatment was given:\r\nHead to be washed four times a day with _Skookum chuck_ soap. A\r\nfive-grain powder 2x trituration was given every hour during the first\r\nweek, when _Sulphur_, third decimal, was given for three days, and\r\n_Skookum chuck_, second decimal, was continued for one week. One-grain\r\npowder of the 1x was given in water four times a day for two weeks; then\r\nthe third decimal trituration was used until June 1st, when patient was\r\ndischarged cured.\r\n\r\nCASE 5. Mr. J., nasal catarrh, of years' standing. A greenish-yellow\r\ndischarge having the odor of a slight ozoena. The patient had been so\r\nmuch relieved that he is at present writing very comfortable, and\r\nbelieves that he will be permanently cured.\r\n\r\nCASE 6. Mrs. D., aged thirty-six, prolonged suppuration due to abscess\r\nof the axilla; nine months' standing. June 20th the following treatment\r\nwas given: The abscess was washed four times a day with the solution of\r\n_Skookum_ salts, five grains to one quart of water, and the 2x given\r\ninternally every two hours until July 10th, when the abscess was healed.\r\nA two-grain powder was then continued, night and morning for one month,\r\nwith no return of the abscess. To sum up, I have simply verified what\r\nDr. Gentry and others have given us about the remedy. I have used it\r\nwith gratifying success in all suppurating wounds. It evidently has a\r\ngreat sphere of action, and I hope some day to see a good proving.\r\n\r\n     (The following was contributed by Dr. B. F. Bailey,\r\n     Lincoln, Neb.:)\r\n\r\nWe have many remedies brought to our notice in an empirical way, which\r\nsoon lose their prominence, first because we have no provings, and\r\nsecond, having no provings, clinical study is not close enough. When\r\n_Skookum chuck_ was first written up, I began to use it and watch its\r\neffects, that it might be possible to find its proper niche in practice.\r\nThe following two cases will, I think, give an idea of the cases in\r\nwhich it may always be depended upon:\r\n\r\nCase No. 1.--A married woman of 40 years of age. History and present\r\ncondition show a lithaemic diathesis. For years has never been free from\r\neczematous troubles. At times suffers much from rheumatism, not\r\ninfrequently, rheumatism disappears to be immediately followed by\r\nhordeoli upon eyelids. Has been treated long and faithfully by\r\nAllopaths, and now for some years by our own school. Prescribed\r\n_Skookum_ 3x--one powder every 4 hours. Improvement was soon evident.\r\nPersisted in this treatment for three months, and now for two years\r\npatient has been perfectly well.\r\n\r\nCase No. 2.--Patient, married woman of about 26 years, comes to me with\r\nurine, sp. grav. 1.030, marked uric acid deposits, flushed face upon a\r\nyellowish background--so often seen in lithaemic cases. Much difficulty\r\nof digestion. Great dryness of skin, especially of scalp, with great\r\ntrouble from falling out of hair--in short a thoroughly lithaemic case.\r\n_Skookum chuck_ 3x every four hours. Satisfactory improvement. Has\r\nfeared head will become entirely bald. Now no loss of hair, and a loss\r\nof the heated, congested feeling of face and head. In fact, a\r\nsatisfactory recovery now of some weeks standing. These cases briefly\r\nstated ought to be of interest, in that they show it to be probable that\r\nwe will find the sphere of action of _Skookum_ to be in lithaemic cases,\r\nand for the treatment of these cases we have but a few clearly defined\r\nreliable remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLANUM CAROLINENSE.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Solanaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Horse-nettle.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh, ripe berries are macerated in twice their\r\nweight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (In 1889 Dr. Napier called attention to _Solanum\r\n     Carolinense_ as a remedy in the treatment of epilepsy,\r\n     stating that it was used as a domestic remedy in the\r\n     South for convulsions and \"that he had successfully\r\n     prescribed it in his practice.\" Dr. Charles S. Potts, of\r\n     the University of Pennsylvania, contributes a paper\r\n     _Therap. Gazette_, Dec., 1895, on the remedy, giving some\r\n     new points, from which the following is condensed:)\r\n\r\nAt the clinic for nervous diseases of the University Hospital, _Solanum\r\nCarolinense_ was tried in a series of twenty-five cases, twenty-one of\r\nwhich were idiopathic, three organic, and one probably so. Of these,\r\neight of the idiopathic cases either did not return after the first\r\nvisit or else were not under observation sufficiently long to offer a\r\nfair test. In the remaining seventeen cases the following results were\r\nobtained--viz., five, two of them organic, were not improved. In the\r\nremaining twelve the results showed more or less benefit from the use of\r\nthe drug. The five cases in which no improvement was noted were\r\nafterwards placed upon other treatment, either antipyrin and bromide of\r\nammonium or the mixed bromides with amelioration of the symptoms in\r\nfour; in the remaining one no drug seemed to be of service. The dose\r\nused at first was 10 drops. This dose was found to be useless, and after\r\nthe first few cases they varied from 30 drops to teaspoonful three or\r\nfour times daily. No unpleasant effects were observed, excepting a mild\r\ndiarrhoea in some cases. This was also noticed by Dr. Herdman. He also\r\nnoticed that in large doses the temperature was lowered and the pulse\r\nslowed.\r\n\r\nIn many epileptics diarrhoea is more of a benefit than otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions derived from the results obtained in seventeen cases\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n1. That the drug has a decided influence for good upon the epileptic\r\nparoxysm.\r\n\r\n2. That this influence is probably not so great or so sure as that\r\nobtained by the use of antipyrin and the bromide salts or even of the\r\nmixed bromides.\r\n\r\n3. That in those cases in which it is of service it relieves the\r\nparoxysms, without causing any other unpleasant symptoms, such as are\r\nsometimes caused by the use of large doses of the bromides.\r\n\r\n4. That the dose ordinarily recommended is too small, and that as much\r\nas a teaspoonful or more four times daily is often needed to secure\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the cases in which the remedy seemed to act\r\nbeneficially:\r\n\r\nH. T., male, aged thirteen years. Idiopathic epilepsy; had his first\r\nspell when five years of age; averages one paroxysm daily. The _Solanum_\r\nwas first given in 10 drop doses _t. i. d._ without effect. When\r\nincreased to 25 drops the spells were lighter in severity, but occurred\r\nabout as often. The dose was finally increased to a teaspoonful four\r\ntimes daily. After being put upon this dose he was under observation six\r\nweeks, during which time he had six seizures much lighter in severity.\r\n\r\nT. H., male, aged twenty-eight years. He had epileptic seizures for the\r\npast three years. They followed an injury to the head which rendered him\r\nunconscious, but produced no other visible injury. Since this, however,\r\nhas had almost constant headache. First spell six month after the\r\ninjury, and have been very frequent since, averaging three to four\r\nweekly; they are of ordinary type. _Solanum_ in 40 drop doses three\r\ntimes daily was ordered. Spells at once decreased in frequency and\r\nseverity. During the last six weeks he was under observation he only had\r\nthree spells, very mild in type.\r\n\r\nC. R., male, aged twenty-one years. Epileptic seizures for past three\r\nyears following an injury. Had been trephined in right parietal region\r\nbefore coming under our observation. After trephining the symptom\r\nimproved, but got worse again; when seen by us was having one daily.\r\n40-drop doses of _Solanum_ caused diarrhoea, and dose was reduced to\r\n30 drops _t. i. d._, when diarrhoea ceased. Under this treatment he\r\nhad no spell for two weeks. In the following month he had three spells;\r\nwas then lost to observation.\r\n\r\nA. N., male, aged thirty years. First spell one year ago; have since\r\noccurred every two weeks; good deal of headache. Ordered _Solanum_ 30\r\ndrops _t. i. d._ No spells for one month and headache ceased. He then\r\nstopped attendance.\r\n\r\nJ. D., female, aged eighteen years. First spell when thirteen years old;\r\nhas one spell a month at the time of her menstrual period. About a week\r\nbefore this period was given 40 drops _t. i. d._, and escaped the usual\r\nspell. The following month, however, she had one.\r\n\r\nI. K., female, aged twenty-five years. Nocturnal epilepsy for past three\r\nyears; about one spell a month. While using 40 drops _t. i. d._ went\r\nthree weeks longer than usual without a spell. The dose was then\r\nincreased to 1 fluid drachm _t. i. d._; she then ceased her visits.\r\n\r\nF. S., female, aged twelve years. First spell five weeks ago; has been\r\nhaving them daily since. _Solanum_ 30 drops _t. i. d._, ordered; this\r\ndose was gradually increased to 1 fluid drachm _t. i. d._ During the\r\nthree months that she was under observation her spells averaged in\r\nnumber about one a week.\r\n\r\nH. B., male, aged eighteen years. First convulsion at age of ten years;\r\nthen had none until three months ago; has had general convulsions about\r\nonce daily since. _Solanum_, 40 drops _t. i. d._, ordered. He was only\r\nunder observation nine days, having during that time four spells, much\r\nmilder in character.\r\n\r\nA. C., female, aged fifteen years. First convulsion one year ago; they\r\nhave been increasing in frequency; now has one about every three days.\r\nDuring the three weeks she was taking 30 drops of _Solanum_ three times\r\na day she had one spell, that occurring during the third week.\r\n\r\nH. K., male, aged eighteen years. First spell when fourteen years old.\r\nEvery three or four days has several attacks in succession, an average\r\nof about one daily. While taking _Solanum_ in 40-drop--afterwards\r\nincreased to teaspoonful--doses he had twelve in thirty-eight days, an\r\naverage of a little less than one in three days, going six without\r\nhaving any.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIRITUS GLANDIUM QUERCUS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD.--Cupuliferae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME--European or English oak.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The spirit is destilled from the tincture prepared by\r\nmacerating the acorn kernals from the Quercus robur, in five times their\r\nweight of dilute alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following, from Rademacher, is quoted and translated\r\n     by Dr. J. C. Burnett in his _Diseases of the Spleen_).\r\n\r\nI became acquainted with this remedy in a wonderful way. Many years ago\r\n(I do not remember the exact time) a working carpenter, who had\r\npreviously lived at Crefeld, came to seek my advice for his bellyache,\r\nwhich was of long standing. According to his own statement, he had long\r\nbeen under Sanitary Councillor Schneider in Crefeld, who was not able to\r\nhelp him, and so sent him to Professor Guenther in Duisberg. Ten journeys\r\nthither were likewise in vain.\r\n\r\nI tried my usual remedies for seemingly such cases, but to no good; and\r\nas I noticed he was a good cabinetmaker, and dabbled a bit in\r\nupholstery, I told him it would be a good plan if he were to hire\r\nhimself out to a country squire as joiner, thinking that the food of the\r\nservants' hall would suit his sick stomach better than the beans, black\r\nbread, and potatoes of the master carpenter. The good fellow followed my\r\nadvice, and lived with a squire for many years; and I heard nothing more\r\nabout him. Finally, he married the parlormaid, and settled here in this\r\ntown as a joiner. One day when visiting his sick wife I remembered the\r\nold story of his bellyache, and wanted to know how it then was. \"All\r\nright,\" said he, \"I have not had it for years.\" It seems that a local\r\nsurgeon, being one day at the squire's, told him to get some acorns, and\r\nscrape them with a knife, and then put the scrapings into brandy and\r\nleave them to draw for a day, and then to drink a small glass of this\r\nspirit several times a day. He did as he was advised, and was forthwith\r\nrelieved, and very soon entirely freed from his old trouble.\r\n\r\nFrom what I knew of the surgeon, I was very sure he could not give me\r\nany intelligent reason for his prescription. I should only have heard\r\nthat acorn scrapings in brandy were good for the bellyache, or, at the\r\nmost, I may have ascertained from what doctor, or peasant, or old wife\r\nhe had got the tip.\r\n\r\nBut this would have done me but poor service; and as I had in the\r\nmeantime become much more cunning, I questioned the joiner himself\r\nafresh as to the kind of his old pain, particularly as to the part of\r\nthe belly where the pain was _last felt_ when he had had a bad attack.\r\nHe was in no doubt about it, but at once pointed to the part of the\r\nbelly nearest the left hypochondrium. So I very shrewdly suspected that\r\nthe abdominal pains were really owing to a primary affection of the\r\nspleen, in which notion I was strengthened by remembering that the best\r\npain-killing hepatic and enteric remedies had done him no good.\r\n\r\nTo get as soon as possible to the bottom of the thing, I set about\r\npreparing a tincture of acorns, and gave a teaspoonful five times a day\r\nin water to an old brandy drunkard, who was sick unto death, and of whom\r\nI knew that he had suffered from the spleen for a very long time, the\r\nspleen being from time to time painful. He had likewise ascites, and his\r\nlegs were dropsical as far as the knees. It occurred to me that if the\r\nacorn tincture were to act curatively on the spleen the consensual\r\nkidney affection and its dependent dropsy would mend. I soon saw that I\r\nhad reckoned rightly. The urinary secretion was at once augmented, but\r\nthe patient complained that each time after taking the medicine he felt\r\na constriction of the chest. I ascribed this to the astringent matter of\r\nthe acorns, and thinking the really curative principle thereof would\r\nmost likely be volatile I caused the tincture to be distilled. This\r\nacorn spirit caused no further constriction, and the urinary secretion\r\nwas still more markedly increased, the tension in the praecordia became\r\nless and less, and this hopelessly incurable drunkard got quite well,\r\nmuch to the surprise of all who knew him, and, honestly speaking, much\r\nto my own surprise also.\r\n\r\nHaving thus put the spirit of acorns to such a severe test, and that in\r\na case that I already knew so well, in which it was impossible to make a\r\nmistake as to the primary affection, I went further, and used it by\r\ndegrees in all sorts of spleen affections, and that not only in painful\r\nones, but in painless ones, in the evident ones, and in those of a more\r\nproblematical kind. Gradually I became convinced that it is a remedy,\r\nthe place of which no other can take. More particularly is it of great,\r\nnay, of inestimable value in spleen-dropsy. Later on, I found that the\r\nvolatile curative principle of acorns may be still better extracted with\r\nwater with the addition of alcohol. [The _aqua glandium_ is thus\r\nprepared:--One pound of peeled and crushed acorns to the pound of\r\ndistillate.] Perhaps water alone might extract the healing principle,\r\nbut it would not keep thus, and so the cures would be uncertain, not to\r\nmention the fact that such-like decaying medicines are a great trouble\r\nto the chemists. The dose of the spirituous acorn-water (the only\r\npreparation I have used of late years) is half a tablespoonful in water\r\nfour times a day. It has not much taste; some would even say it has\r\nnone, but the doubter may make a solution of alcohol and water in the\r\nsame proportions, and he will soon find that it has quite a taste of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\nI must make mention of two of its peculiar effects. Certain people feel,\r\nas soon as they have taken it, a peculiar sensation in the head, lasting\r\nhardly a minute or two, which they say is like being drunk.\r\n\r\nWith a few people, particularly with those who have suffered from old\r\nspleen engorgements, diarrhoea sets in after using it for two or three\r\nweeks that makes them feel better. It seldom lasts more than a day, and\r\nis not weakening, but moderate. Hence it is not needful either to stop\r\nthe acorn water or to lessen the dose.\r\n\r\nI could add many instructive cases of spleen-dropsies and other spleen\r\naffections in which the volatile principle of acorns proved curative,\r\nbut as I have so much more to say on other subjects I dare not be too\r\ndiscursive on this one point; besides, what I have already said will\r\nsuffice for common-sense physicians. Still I cannot forbear noticing a\r\nfew bagatelles. For instance, I have found that the acute spleen fevers\r\nthat occur intercurrently with epidemic liver fevers are best cured with\r\n_aqua glandium_--at least that is my experience.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am of opinion that the three _splenics_ of which I have\r\nmade mention are curative of three different morbid states of the\r\nspleen, and I know well from my own experience that acorns are indicated\r\nin the most common spleen affections; and, finally, I am not acquainted\r\nwith any positive signs whereby those three separate morbid states of\r\nspleen can with certainty be differentiated from one another.\r\n\r\n     (In a later work, _Gout and its Cure_, by Burnett, the\r\n     remedy is again brought up as follows:)\r\n\r\nFor some years past I have been acquainted with a remedy that antidotes\r\nthe effect of alcohol very prettily, as I will show. I enter upon the\r\nsubject in this place, because it deserves to be widely known, and also\r\nbecause in the treatment of gout, the alcoholism not infrequently bars\r\nthe way. The remedy I refer to is the distilled spirit of\r\nacorns--_Spiritus glandium quercus_. My first account will be found in\r\nmy \"Diseases of the Spleen,\" where _Spiritus glandium quercus_ is dealt\r\nwith as a spleen medicine. I speak of set purpose of the homoeopathic\r\nantidote, because alcoholism is a disease, and as such must be met by\r\nspecific medication.\r\n\r\nSome of Rademacher's patients complained to him that while taking his\r\nacorn medicine they felt in their heads somewhat as if they were drunk;\r\nbut as Rademacher did not believe in the law of similars--indeed, knew\r\nbut little about it--their complaint had no ulterior significance to\r\nhim, but still it struck him as worthy of record. \"A few, but not many,\r\nof those who take it immediately feel a peculiar sensation in the head,\r\nwhich they say is like they feel when they are drunk, the sensation\r\nlasting only a minute or two.\" Now, in the light of the homoeopathic\r\nlaw, this symptom is eminently suggestive, but whether any one beside\r\nmyself has ever noticed this symptom I am not aware. Rademacher had\r\npreviously related the following brilliant cure. * * * He says that in\r\norder to get a clear idea of the action of the remedy he caused to be\r\nprepared a tincture of acorns, of which he gave a teaspoonful in water\r\nfive times a day to an almost moribund brandy toper, who had long been\r\nsuffering from a spleen affection that at times caused him a good deal\r\nof pain, and who, at the time in question, had severe ascites and whose\r\nlower extremities were dropsical up as far as the knees. Our author was\r\nof opinion that the affection was a primary disease of the spleen, and\r\nreasoned that if the tincture of acorns cured the spleen the kidneys\r\nwould duly resume work and the ascitic and anasarcous state would\r\ndisappear. He soon found he was right; patient at once began to pass\r\nmore urine, but he complained that every time he took a dose of the\r\nmedicine he got a constriction about the chest, and this Rademacher\r\nascribed to the astringent quality of the acorns, and to avoid this he\r\nhad the tincture of acorns distilled. The administration of this\r\ndistilled preparation was not followed by any unpleasant symptom, and\r\nthe quantity of urine passed increased still more, the tension on the\r\npraecordia slowly lessened and this inveterate drunkard got quite well,\r\nmuch to the amazement of everybody, Rademacher included, for he did not\r\nat all expect him to recover.\r\n\r\nNow, it must be admitted that a remedy that can cure an old drunkard of\r\ngeneral dropsy and restore him to health deserves closer acquaintance,\r\nand when we first regard it from the pathogenetic side as producing, of\r\ncourse, contingently, a cephalic state, resembling alcoholic\r\nintoxication, and then from the clinical side as having cured an\r\nabandoned drunkard, it looks very much as if we had a remedy\r\nhomoeopathic to alcoholism. I may add that Rademacher nowhere hints\r\nthat the _Spiritus glandium quercus_ stands in any relation to\r\nalcoholism; he regards it merely as a spleen medicine, specially\r\nindicated in dropsy due to a primary spleen affection. At first I\r\nregarded it merely in the same light, but when I really gripped the\r\nsignificance of the pathogenetic symptoms just quoted I thought we might\r\nfind in our common acorns a notable homoeopathic anti-alcoholic.\r\n\r\n(It is not fair to quote further from Burnett, but we may add that in\r\nhis book, _Gout and Its Cure_, there are given a number of clinical\r\ncases in which the remedy acted brilliantly in those addicted to\r\ntippling, or drinking hard. It is not so much that the remedy extirpates\r\nthe habit, but it enables those afflicted to easily control their\r\nappetite and drink \"like other people,\" without that insatiable craving.\r\nThe dose is about ten drops in water three to four times a day.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLIDAGO VIRGA-AUREA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Compositae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Golden Rod\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh blossoms are macerated in twice their weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following is to be found on p. 131 of Dr.\r\n     Gallavardin's \"Homoeopathic Treatment of Alcoholism:\")\r\n\r\n\"A lady, by administering, morning and evening, an infusion of the dry\r\nleaves and flowers of Golden Rod (_Solidago virga-aurea_) tells me that\r\nshe cured her husband of an affection of the bladder which had compelled\r\nhim to use a catheter for a year or more. A friend of Homoeopathy, not\r\na physician, desired to test the efficaciousness of this plant. He\r\ncaused the first dilution of its tincture to be taken three times a day\r\nby seven patients of from forty-two to seventy-four years of age, who\r\nhad been obliged to catheterize themselves for weeks, months and years,\r\nand cured them so thoroughly that they had no relapses. Surgeons who\r\nspend much time in catheterizing such patients for months and years\r\ncould often cure them much more rapidly by prescribing for them the\r\nremedy just mentioned.\"\r\n\r\n     (Dr. A. E. White, _Homoeopathic Recorder_, July, 1891,\r\n     relates the following case:)\r\n\r\nMrs.----, age 37, married, has had seven children. Came to me December\r\n10, 1890, with the following history: \"Had not had her menses for four\r\nmonths. Thought she was in a family way. Abdomen bloated up every P.M.;\r\nsick at her stomach all of the time; frontal headache, P.M.; felt better\r\nwhen first getting up in the morning, at which time her abdomen was\r\nalmost normal in size.\r\n\r\n\"Her water she complained of more than anything else. Had to pass it\r\nevery half hour during day and several times during night.\r\n\r\n\"Backache all of the time, which was not decreased by passing water.\r\nUrine had a white, slimy deposit on standing a short time.\r\n\r\n\"Requested an examination, but could not discover that she was in a\r\nfamily way. Found her back very sensitive in region of kidneys, trace of\r\nalbumin in urine.\r\n\r\n\"I gave her a vial of _Solidago_ 1x, told her to take two disks every\r\nfour hours and report in three or four days. She came back December\r\n13th, 'the medicine went right to the spot.' From the second dose her\r\nwater became natural and she did not bloat so much in P.M. Her stomach\r\ndid not bother her any more. I gave her a bottle of _Puls._ 3x to take\r\nwith the _Solidago_, and she reported December 17th, that her menses had\r\ncome on.\r\n\r\n\"I have used it in several other cases where it seemed indicated by the\r\ntenderness in kidney region and the inability to control the water from\r\nwhatever cause, always with perfect satisfaction to patient and myself.\"\r\n\r\n     (The following paper on the use of _Solidago virga-aurea_\r\n     is by Dr. M. Gucken, of Eupen, Germany:)\r\n\r\nThe Golden Rod is in Homoeopathy, according to my opinion, not as much\r\nmade use of as it deserves. Foh. Gottfr. Rademacher, who has many\r\nadmirers among us, says, in his _Justification of Experience in\r\nMedicine_, about _Virga-aurea_: \"This herb is a very old and good kidney\r\nmedicine. It is a specific for kidneys, and brings the patients back to\r\nthe normal condition.\" I have used the Golden Rod for a long time, and\r\nhave to make favorable reports. The results of extensive homoeopathic\r\nproving of this remedy on healthy persons cannot be found in our\r\nliterature, but a Wuertemburg physician, Dr. Buck, has given us a list of\r\ncures with the Golden Rod in the popular homoeopathic paper edited by\r\nDr. Bolle, which wholly confirms the statements of Rademacher, besides\r\nthe cases reported by Dr. Buck.\r\n\r\nAccording to this last, _Virga-aurea_ is especially adapted for\r\nscrofulous subjects; at the same time other constitutions do not exclude\r\nthe use of this remedy. In the first place, _the condition and the\r\naction of the kidneys and the quality of their secretions_ are to be\r\nconsidered in the selection of this remedy. The symptoms on the part of\r\nthe kidneys and the urinary organs, which point to _Virga-aurea_, are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nPains in the kidneys; region of kidneys painful upon pressure; feeling\r\nof enlargement and tension in the kidneys, also pains in the kidneys\r\nwhich extend forward to the abdomen and to the bladder. Dysuria,\r\ndifficult and scanty urination; urine dark, red-brown, with thick\r\nsediment; stone and gravel, albumen, blood or slime in the urine; urine\r\ndark, with sediments of phosphates; slightly sour, neutral or alkaline;\r\nurine with numerous epithelial cells or small mucous particles.\r\nEpithelial cells with gravel of triple phosphates, or phosphate of lime.\r\nBright's disease.\r\n\r\nSide symptoms which point to this remedy:\r\n\r\n_Skin._--Scrofulous rash; little blotches on hands and feet, itching\r\nvery much; very obstinate, itching exanthemas; exanthema of the lower\r\nextremities without swelling of the inguinal glands, but with\r\ndisturbance in urinating (catarrh of the kidneys).\r\n\r\n_Sleep._--Insomnia.\r\n\r\n_Fever._--Rheumatic fever; very frequent pulse; high fever.\r\n\r\n_Head._--Headache.\r\n\r\n_Eyes._--Scrofulous, herpetic inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Ears._--Sudden deafness, with ringing in the ears and albuminous urine.\r\n\r\n_Nose._--Dry; the inner surface of the nose covered with blood crust;\r\nscalding and very scanty brown urine.\r\n\r\n_Mouth._--Flat ulcers in the mouth and throat.\r\n\r\n_Gastric: Stomach, Abdomen and Stool._--Continuous bitter taste,\r\ndisturbing the rest, especially nights; heavily covered tongue, which\r\ndoes not become clean in spite of the use of anti-gastric remedies, and\r\nonly cleanses itself at the return of abundant urinating; chronic\r\ncatarrh of the bowels; diarrhoea, with scanty, dark urine; dysentery;\r\ncostiveness; sensation of pain in the abdomen on both sides of the\r\nnavel, upon deep pressure; physconia of the abdomen by gases; severe\r\npricking in both hypochondria to the region of the kidneys, reaching to\r\nthe lower extremities, with continued bitter taste in the mouth,\r\nespecially at night, with very scanty brown and sour urine.\r\n\r\n_Female Parts._--Haemorrhage, chronic leucorrhoea, in connection with\r\ncopious, watery urine and sediments of mucous particles and uriniferous\r\ntubules; epithelium.\r\n\r\n_Respiratory Organs._--Heavy expectoration in coughing; croup, with\r\nlittle blotches on the hands and diminished urine; chronic catarrh of\r\nthe lungs; continuous dyspnoea; periodical asthma, with nightly\r\ndysuria.\r\n\r\n_Trunk and Lower Limbs._--Rheumatism of the intercostal muscles; chronic\r\npains in the loins; limping, dragging gait; rheumatic pains in the\r\nlegs; pains in the thighs; the legs can be moved horizontally, but when\r\nmoved perpendicularly they feel lame.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these symptoms the description of a few cases of\r\nsickness, in which _Virga-aurea_ proved itself, might be of some\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nCLINICAL.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1886 scarlet-diphtheria appeared in this place. On\r\nMarch 28th I was called to attend the 8-year old son Matthias, of\r\nWernerus, a weaver, in the hamlet of Niepert, that showed symptoms of\r\nthe above disease. Cynanche was at high degree, and the throat was\r\nfilled with diphtheritic coating, so much so that I had reason to fear\r\nthe worst, on account of the accompanying fever and of the choked-up\r\ncondition and weakly (scrofulous) habit of the patient. But the\r\nwell-known remedy of Viller, given alternately with _Belladonna_, proved\r\nitself also in this case, and the symptoms in the throat assumed, after\r\na few days, a less dangerous character. Not so with the fever, which\r\ngradually assumed the form of typhoid, and ran very high, while the\r\nscarlet-rash grew quite pale. On the morning of April 5th, his\r\ntemperature was 42.5 deg., the patient unconscious, the pulse weak and\r\nintermittent, the feet swollen. Upon inquiry the parents told me that\r\nthe boy urinated very little. His urine, of which I had taken a quantity\r\nthe day previous for examination, contained a considerable amount of\r\nalbuminous sediments. I prescribed _Kali arsenicosum_ in the fourth\r\ncentesimal potency, which had been recommended in similar cases by Dr.\r\nHock in the international homoeopathic press; but, although the\r\ntemperature decreased after using this remedy, the dropsical swelling of\r\nthe feet increased more and more, and after a few days the entire body\r\nof the patient was swollen very much. The discharge of urine grew\r\ncontinually less. Under these circumstances I examined the patient again\r\nthoroughly, and found great sensitiveness of the kidneys against\r\npressure, in spite of his otherwise apathetic condition. These symptoms\r\nreminded me of _Virga-aurea_. This remedy was immediately applied, and I\r\nhad no reason to regret it. Within one day the urinal discharge became\r\nprofuse, the general condition improving at the same time; the peeling\r\noff took place without further trouble, and after the patient had taken\r\n_Virga-aurea_ for two weeks, and, on account of anaemia, for one week\r\nthree times a day, a dose of _Ferrum peroxydatum_ in the 2d trituration,\r\nhe had so far recovered that I did not consider it necessary to give\r\nfurther medicine.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 a 45-year-old Belgian mine official (his work was office-work)\r\nconsulted me on account of sleeplessness and pain in the back. The\r\npatient had no other complaints, only he carelessly added it sometimes\r\ntook him a long time to urinate, because of want of the necessary\r\npressure. He considered this weakness as the result of gonorrhoea,\r\nfrom which he had suffered years ago. The sleeplessness, for which he\r\nhad tried all remedies possible, would make itself known from the time\r\nhe went to bed until 3 o'clock in the morning, at which time he could\r\nget sleep, but not a refreshing one, and on arising he would feel very\r\ntired, especially in the upper part of the thighs, and then would\r\ncommence the pain in the back, which extended to the loins, and lasted\r\nuntil he went to bed in the evening, without being prompted by external\r\ninfluences (warmth, cold, rest, motion). Also sleeplessness nights, pain\r\nin the back daytimes. At first I considered _Nux vom._ proper, and I\r\nprescribed the same for the patient, in the 3d decimal potency, four\r\ndrops twice a day. At the same time I requested the patient to bring a\r\nsample of his urine at his next visit. After some time he came back with\r\nthe sample, and declared that the prescribed remedy had not shown the\r\nleast effect.\r\n\r\nThe urine was dark and slimy, reddish, slightly acid, and had at the\r\nbottom of the bottle brick-dust settlings. Heat did not show albumen,\r\nbut by heating it the dark urine became clearer, and contained also\r\nsalts of uric acid. I examined the kidneys of the patient, found them\r\nsensitive against pressure, and the diagnosis pointed to chronic catarrh\r\nof the kidneys. Sleeplessness, pain in the back and the tired feeling in\r\nthe upper parts of the thigh were additional symptoms of this malady,\r\nand I determined to use _Virga-aurea_. The patient took this for three\r\nmonths three times a day, after which he wrote me that he was entirely\r\nwell. About a year afterwards he had a relapse, but not in the form of\r\nformer symptoms, but in the form of ischias, against which disease\r\nGolden Rod proved itself beneficial.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, may be mentioned a double case of the curative power of\r\n_Virga-aurea_, which also contributes to the heredity of disease. Some\r\ntime ago, the wife of a farmer, 53 years old, asked me for a\r\nprescription for a trouble which she had had for twenty-six years, since\r\nher first confinement. The patient, a stout and fresh-looking person,\r\nmade the following statement: After the confinement, which was very\r\nlaborious, and which was followed by prolapsus uteri, the latter still\r\nexisting, her legs began to swell, and an itching rash broke out by\r\ndegrees. Menstruation had always come at the proper time, but suddenly\r\nstopped six months ago.\r\n\r\nSince that time the itching had become almost intolerable, the legs more\r\nswollen and always cold, but she did not feel a continuous heat in her\r\nhead. The appetite was very poor; she had always a bitter taste in the\r\nmouth, and the tongue was thickly coated. At the same time she had\r\nrising from the stomach, as if she should suffocate, and at the least\r\nexertion she lost her breath. She urinated very little, and this mostly\r\nat night. My question, if there were pains in the back, was answered in\r\nthe negative, but the kidneys of this patient were also sensitive\r\nagainst pressure. The appearance of the lower limbs of the patient\r\nfrightened me. From knee to heel they formed a bluish-red mass in the\r\nshape of a stove-pipe, which were covered with little blotches and\r\ncrusts. This kind of an eruption, together with the other symptoms, led\r\nme to the use of _Virga-aurea_, the prolonged use of which, although it\r\ndid not affect a cure, produced a mitigation of the whole body, so that\r\nthe lady induced her eldest son to come to me for help. This man had\r\nalso trouble in his lower limbs not unlike his mother. He had a year ago\r\npassed through a severe throat difficulty, after which his lower limbs\r\nbegan to swell and to itch; they were also tainted bluish-red and\r\ncovered with vesicles; he also complained of scanty urine, and his\r\nkidneys were sensitive against pressure. What better could I, under the\r\ncircumstances, prescribe than _Virga-aurea_?\r\n\r\nThe result was good. After a few months the patient had no more\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the cases above mentioned, I prescribed the 3d decimal dilution of\r\nthe tincture of the whole plant of Golden Rod. The water of Golden Rod,\r\nrecommended by Rademacher and others, I have never tried.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTELLARIA MEDIA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD.--Caryophyllaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME.--Common Chickweed.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The whole fresh plant in bloom is macerated in twice its\r\nweight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (Frederick Kopp proved this remedy and the results were\r\n     published in the _Homoeopathic World_, 1896, as\r\n     follows:)\r\n\r\n\"It has proved to me a matter of impossibility to answer all the letters\r\nthat have been sent to me by readers of the _Homoeopathic World_ on\r\nthe subject of the use of _Stellaria media_ in the treatment of\r\nrheumatism, but I trust that the information given below will satisfy\r\nall the correspondents. It will be remembered by my readers that the new\r\ndrug was first proved by me in 1893, consequent on my attention being\r\ndrawn to the weed by our esteemed friend, the Rev. F. H. Brett. I made a\r\nthorough proving of the drug, not only once, but several times, so as to\r\nsatisfy myself beyond a doubt as to the symptoms peculiar to it, and\r\nthe excruciating rheumatic-like pains developed at the time are still\r\nvividly remembered by me; in fact, they were so severe and intense as\r\nnot to be easily forgotten when once experienced. There is no mistaking\r\nthe _rheumatic_ symptoms of the drug. They come on very rapidly, and the\r\nsharp, darting pains so peculiar to rheumatism are experienced, not only\r\nin almost every part of the body, but the symptoms of soreness of the\r\nparts to the touch, stiffness of the joints, and aggravation of the\r\npains by motion are also present. These pains may be described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Rheumatic-like pains over the right side of the head; especially\r\ntowards the back, with the parts sore to the touch; rheumatic-like pains\r\ndarting through the whole head, worse on right side; rheumatic-like\r\npains left half of forehead, over the eye, with the parts sore to the\r\ntouch; rheumatic-like pains in the left foot; rheumatic-like pains in\r\nthe ankles; sharp, darting, rheumatic-like pains in the left knee,\r\ngradually extending above along the thigh; rheumatic-like pains below\r\nthe right knee-cap; rheumatic-like, darting pains through various parts\r\nof the body, especially down the right arm and the middle and index\r\nfingers of the left hand; stiffness of the joints in general;\r\nrheumatic-like pains in the calves of the legs, which are sensitive to\r\nthe touch; rheumatic-like pains in the right hip; rheumatic-like pains\r\nacross the small of the back, aggravated by bending or stooping;\r\nstiffness in lumbar region with soreness; darting, rheumatic-like pains\r\nthrough right thigh; rheumatic-like pains in right groin.\r\n\r\n\"It will be seen by the above symptoms that almost every part of the\r\nbody in which it is possible for rheumatic pains to occur is affected,\r\nthe rheumatic-like pains darting from one part to another. My\r\ncorrespondents all being readers of _The Homoeopathic World_ will\r\nremember a case reported in the January number of the journal (1896), by\r\nMr. R. H. Bellairs, in which the pains were 'now in ankle, now in knee,\r\nnow in arm, wrist, or fingers.' This case fully illustrates the\r\nsymptoms borne out in my proving of the drug, and it but naturally\r\nfollowed, according to the law of similars, that the disease should\r\nyield to the month's treatment with _Stellaria media_. Mr. Bellairs says\r\nhe thinks that possibly 'shifting pain' is a key-note, and I am glad\r\nthat I am able to inform him that he is correct in his supposition. I am\r\npleased to hear that he has often given _Stellaria media_ in chronic\r\nrheumatism, and now looks upon it as a specific. It is these things that\r\ngladden the heart of the prover of new drugs--the news of the practical\r\ntriumph of a new drug over symptoms of disease similar to those it is\r\nitself capable of developing in a healthy body--and one feels amply\r\nrepaid for the hours and days of pain and suffering that one has\r\ninevitably to put up with in the vocation of 'proving.' I heartily\r\ncongratulate Mr. Bellairs on his success in curing the above case.\r\n\r\n\"I have been asked by one correspondent whether a changeable\r\nclimate--one with sudden changes of temperature occurring every day, for\r\ninstance--would prevent the drug from taking effect in the treatment of\r\nrheumatism. To this question I can promptly return an answer in the\r\nnegative. I have proof upon proof lying before me to testify that\r\n_Stellaria media_ is just as efficacious in a changeable climate as in\r\nany other. Reports of cases cured have come to me from various parts of\r\nthe world, under varying changes of climate, and the result has always\r\nbeen the same, namely, 'the cure of the case.'\r\n\r\n\"For _internal_ administration I have always found the 2x tincture the\r\nmost efficacious, given in from one to two drop doses every two, three,\r\nor four hours, according to the severity of the symptoms. For _external_\r\npurposes I strongly advise the [Greek: theta] tincture. It may be\r\nemployed either in the form of a lotion (20 to 60 minims of [Greek:\r\ntheta] tincture to a tumblerful of water), the ointment or the liniment\r\n(30 to 40 minims of the [Greek: theta] tincture to [Latin: ezh]j of\r\npure olive oil). Cloths steeped in the lotion and renewed when dry may\r\nbe applied to the painful parts, or the ointment or liniment may be\r\nrubbed well in. Experience has taught me that external treatment\r\ncombined with internal greatly assists in hastening the cure. In the\r\ntreatment of rheumatism _Stellaria media_ is a very active drug, acting\r\nvery promptly; a low dilution of the mother tincture of the drug taken\r\ninternally is very apt, therefore, to intensify the pains, and these\r\nshould therefore be avoided and the 2x dilution used.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSTIGMATA MAIDIS.\r\n\r\nA Tincture of the Fresh Corn Silk.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD.--Gramineae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME.--Corn Silk.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--One part of fresh corn silk is macerated in two parts by\r\nweight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (A great deal has been published lately concerning this\r\n     remedy. The following by Dr. Dufan, _London Medical\r\n     Record_, seems to give the best outline of its uses:)\r\n\r\n1. The stigmata of maize have a very marked, though not always a\r\nfavorable, action in all affections of the bladder, whether acute or\r\nchronic.\r\n\r\n2. In acute traumatic cystitis, and also in gonorrhoeal cystitis, they\r\nhave a very marked diuretic action, but, at the same time, increase the\r\npain; hence they should not be employed in these cases.\r\n\r\n3. The best results have been obtained in cases of uric or phosphatic\r\ngravel, of chronic cystitis, whether simple or consecutive to gravel,\r\nand of mucous or muco-purulent catarrh. All the symptoms of the disease,\r\nthe vesical pains, the dysuria, the excretion of sand, the ammoniacal\r\nodor, etc., rapidly disappear under the influence of the medicine.\r\n\r\n4. The retention of urine dependent on these various affections often\r\ndisappears as improvement progresses, but the use of the sound must\r\nsometimes be continued, in order to empty the bladder completely.\r\n\r\n5. The stigmata maize have very often produced a cure after all the\r\nusual internal remedies had been tried in vain, or with only partial\r\nsuccess. In other cases, the ordinary methods of treatment, which had at\r\nfirst proved more or less entirely useless, became efficacious after\r\nstigmata had been administered for a time, and had, as it were, broken\r\nthe ground for them. Most frequently the stigmata alone sufficed for the\r\ncure, but still in some cases the effect was incomplete, and it was\r\nfound that the treatment could be varied with benefit. Injections and\r\nirrigations of the bladder also proved useful adjuncts to the maize.\r\n\r\n6. As the stigmata of maize are a very powerful, though at the same time\r\nentirely inoffensive diuretic, they have also been employed with the\r\nbest results in cases of heart disease, albuminuria, and other\r\naffections requiring diuretics. Cases have been reported in which the\r\nurinary secretion was tripled and even quintupled in the first\r\ntwenty-four hours, and others where the exhibition of the drug was\r\ncontinued for two or three months without the slightest untoward effect.\r\n\r\n     (Though Dr. Dufan condemns the use of the remedy in\r\n     gonorrhoea, other practitioners have commended it for\r\n     that very purpose. Dr. Leo Bennett, _Therapeutic\r\n     Gazette_, 1893, having had \"unusual success\" in the\r\n     treatment of that disease with the _Stigmata maidis_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCINIC ACID.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The pure chemical is triturated in the usual way.\r\n\r\n     (The following is by Dr. Morris Weiner, of Baltimore,\r\n     1892:)\r\n\r\nAbout twelve years ago I decided to prove _Succinic acid_ (_Acidum\r\nsuccinicum_). _Agricola_ mentions this acid, 1546, as _Salt of amber_.\r\n_Boyle_, towards the close of the 17th century, was the first who\r\npronounced it to be acid, and _Stecker de Neuform_ confirmed this\r\nstatement, after repeated investigations, calling it a _true_ acid.\r\n_Berzelius_ published its elemental composition, C_{4}H_{2}O_{3}.\r\n\r\nThis acid was long ago laid aside as obsolete, and not without good\r\nreason, because since the Puritans in chemistry commenced to rule over\r\nevery laboratory of pharmacy, by trying to redistill this crude acid and\r\nchanging its yellowish color to snowy whiteness, they drove out every\r\ntrace of the _oily matter_ which alone constitutes its medical action.\r\nThe whiter this acid becomes the larger doses can be taken without any\r\naction on the human system. Knowing that this _oil of amber_ is driven\r\nout totally by redistillation I was compelled to prepare the crude acid\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThe expense is considerable. One pound of amber yields about half an\r\nounce of crude acid, and the glass retort, after dry distillation, must\r\nbe broken to collect the acid.\r\n\r\nThe fumes of _Acidum succinicum crudum_ are inflammable, producing\r\nasthma, cough, sneezing, weeping, dropping of watery mucus from the\r\nnostrils, pain in chest and headache.\r\n\r\nNone of our remedies gives a truer picture of hay fever, and since the\r\n_oil of amber_ must be securely inclosed in the amber itself, it was but\r\nnatural to conclude that by trituration I may receive all the virtue of\r\nthe remedy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I remembered that necklaces and earrings of amber are\r\nconsidered a popular protection agent against neuralgia, colds, and even\r\nhay fever.\r\n\r\nSince that time I prescribed in cases of hay fever the third decimal\r\ntrituration, one or two grains dissolved in twelve teaspoonfuls of\r\ndistilled water, one teaspoonful every two hours, with the best results,\r\nand have cured more than thirty persons, who were formerly obliged to go\r\nto the mountains to get temporary relief. Already after the first week\r\nmost of them experienced decided relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPHYTUM OFFICINALIS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD.--Borraginaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME.--Comfrey, Healing Herb.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--One part of the fresh root gathered just before blooming\r\nis macerated in two parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following concerning this remedy, which dates back\r\n     to Dioscorides, we find in _American Journal of\r\n     Homoeopathy_, 1846:)\r\n\r\nThe Homoeopathic Examiner for August contains a paper entitled\r\n\"_Connection of Homoeopathy with Surgery_,\" by _Croserio_, translated\r\nby P. P. Wells, M. D. It is there stated that \"injuries of the bones are\r\nhealed most promptly by _Symphytum officinale_ 30 internally once a day.\r\nThis remedy accelerates the consolidation of fractures surprisingly.\"\r\nThe translator adds a note as follows: \"I have had repeated\r\nopportunities of verifying this declaration of Croserio. A boy, fourteen\r\nyears old, broke the bones of the forearm, at the junction of the lower\r\nand middle thirds, two years ago. He had twice repeated the fracture by\r\nslight falls. The ends of the fragments are now slightly movable on each\r\nother, and the arm is weak and admits of little use. Three doses of\r\n_Symphytum_ effected a perfect cure. The lad became more robust, and has\r\nsince had better general health than ever before.\"\r\n\r\nA boy, eight years old, fractured the humerus, near the junction of the\r\ncondyles and shaft. _Arnica_ 30 immediately arrested the spasmodic jerks\r\nof the muscles of the injured arm. This remedy was continued the first\r\nthree days, when the traumatic fever had entirely subsided. He then had\r\n_Symphyt_. [Latin: ezh], gtt. i., in half a tumbler of water, a\r\nteaspoonful every morning and evening. The splints were removed the\r\n_ninth day_, and the bone was found consolidated. The cure was entirely\r\nwithout pain. How much earlier than this the fragments ceased to be\r\nmovable is not known. Well may the author say it heals broken bone\r\nsurprisingly. Let it be remembered that the discovery of this specific\r\nis but one of the many rich fruits of _Hahnemannism_.\r\n\r\n     (The following appeared in the _Homoeopathic World_,\r\n     1890, under the signature F. H. B.:)\r\n\r\nIn none of the Homoeopathic treatises that I possess do I find any\r\nmention of the above remedy. I am surprised at this, for I believe it to\r\nbe a very valuable one in certain cases. Its common name of _knitbone_\r\nseems to point to popular experience of one of its uses; but I believe\r\nits knitting, or uniting, power extends to muscular and other tissues of\r\nthe body, as well as to the bones. Let me give two instances of my own\r\npersonal experience. Many years ago I had an inguinal rupture on each\r\nside, not extensive ones, but causing a protrusion about the size of\r\nhalf a small walnut. After wearing a truss for some time, I bethought me\r\nof what I had heard of the uniting power of Comfrey, and made some\r\ntincture from the root, and rubbed it in. After doing so two or three\r\ntimes, the signs of rupture quite disappeared, and the parts remained\r\nsound for about three years; when, from some cause or other, the right\r\nside broke out again, but as it did not give much trouble I neglected it\r\nfor some time, and then tried the Comfrey tincture again, but this time\r\nwithout success. I suppose the ruptured edges had got too far asunder.\r\nThe left side, however, which originally was the worse of the two, has\r\nkept sound ever since. I think this shows that a rupture, if not too\r\nextensive, and if taken in time, may often be cured by this remedy. The\r\nother case I have to relate was of a different kind. Five weeks ago I\r\nhad a fall on my back, the whole force of which was concentrated on a\r\nsmall portion of the lower spine, through the intervention of the back\r\npad of my truss. I thought for the moment my back must have been broken,\r\nthe pain was so excessive; and not only the back, but diaphragm and all\r\nthe organs below it suffered acutely for three or four weeks after the\r\nfall. But a fortnight after the fall I was for the first time conscious\r\nof a pain and tenderness higher up the spine, at a point, I think, where\r\nribs commence, and on feeling I found a protuberance there, as if a\r\npartial dislocation had taken place there. I again thought of Comfrey,\r\nand had some of the tincture applied. The tenderness at the point\r\nsubsided after two or three applications, and in a few days the\r\nprotuberance disappeared. * * * On more careful examination I find that\r\nthe point of secondary disturbance was higher up than I have\r\ndescribed--two or three inches higher than the first insertion of the\r\nribs in the spinal column.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. Gottweis, in _Hom. Zeitung_, vol. vii., says:)\r\n\r\nAn old and very valuable remedy. This plant is found all over Europe\r\n(and in some parts of North America), in wet fields and ditches. We make\r\na tincture out of it which has marvelous healing and cicatrizing\r\nproperties. _Symphytum_ must be a very old popular remedy; its\r\nreputation is well established, and it is mentioned in all the old\r\nmedical \"tomes.\" The decoction acts as an effective demulcent and\r\npain-killer in severe bruises. It diminishes the irritation in wounds\r\nand ulcers, ameliorates and lessens too copious suppuration and promotes\r\nthe healing processes. In homoeopathic practice the tincture diluted\r\nwith water is used with great success in fractures and bruises or other\r\ninjuries of bones. Its effect is really extraordinary in injuries to\r\nsinews, tendons and the periosteum.\r\n\r\nA few days ago a colleague consulted me about a horse with a stab wound\r\nin the fetlock which would not heal, do what he would, and which\r\nrendered locomotion impossible. (The doctor is by no means a young or\r\ninexperienced veterinarian.) I examined the wound, and at once\r\nrecommended _Symphytum_ [Greek: theta]. Within two weeks the animal was\r\ncured. This remedy really cannot be overestimated.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. W. H. Thompson, President of Royal College of\r\n     Surgeons in Ireland, in an address reported in London\r\n     _Lancet_, 1896, reports a case of which the following is\r\n     the gist:)\r\n\r\nEarly in 1895 he saw a man who was suffering from a malignant growth in\r\nthe nose--\"a malignant tumor of the antrum, which had extended to the\r\nnose.\" An exploratory operation confirmed this diagnosis. \"He refused\r\nthe larger operation. The exploration was made by Dr. Woods. We found\r\nthat the tumor did extend from the antrum, into which I could bore my\r\nfinger easily. Dr. O'Sullivan, Professor of Pathology in Trinity\r\nCollege, declared the growth to be a round-celled sarcoma. Of that there\r\nis no doubt. The tumor returned in a couple of months, and the patient\r\nthen saw Dr. Semon, in London, who advised immediate removal. He\r\nreturned home, and after a further delay he asked to have the operation\r\nperformed. I did this in May last by the usual method. I found the tumor\r\noccupying the whole of the antrum. The base of the skull was everywhere\r\ninfiltrated. The tumor had passed into the right nose and perforated the\r\nseptum so as to extend into the left. It adhered to the septum around\r\nthe site of perforation. This was all removed, leaving a hole in the\r\nseptum about the size of a florin. He went home within a fortnight. In a\r\nmonth the growth showed signs of return. It bulged through the incision\r\nand protruded upon the face. Dr. Woods saw him soon afterwards, as I had\r\ndeclared by letter that a further operation would be of no avail. The\r\ntumor had now almost closed the right eye. It was blue, tense, firm, and\r\nlobulated, but it did not break. Dr. Woods reported the result of his\r\nvisit to me, and we agreed as to the prognosis. Early in October the\r\npatient walked into my study after a visit to Dr. Woods. He looked in\r\nbetter health than I had ever seen him. The tumor had completely\r\ndisappeared from the face, and I could not identify any trace of it in\r\nthe mouth. He said he had no pain of any kind. He could speak well when\r\nthe opening remaining after the removal of the hard palate was plugged,\r\nand he was in town to have an obturator made. He has since gone home\r\napparently well.\"\r\n\r\nThe patient told Dr. Thompson that he had applied poultices of _Comfrey_\r\n(or _Symphytum_) and that was all.\r\n\r\n\"Now this was a case of which none of us had any doubt at all, and our\r\nfirst view was confirmed by the distinguished pathologist whom I have\r\nmentioned and by our own observation at the time of the major operation.\r\nHere, then, was another 'surprise.' I am satisfied as I can be of\r\nanything that the growth was malignant and of a bad type. Of course, we\r\nknow in the history of some tumors that growth is delayed and that in\r\nthe sarcomata recurrence is often late. But this is a case in which the\r\nrecurrence occurred twice--the second time to an extreme degree; and yet\r\nthis recurrent tumor has vanished. What has produced this atrophy and\r\ndisappearance? I do not know. I know nothing of the effects of comfrey\r\nroot, but I do not believe that it can remove a sarcomatous tumor. Of\r\ncourse, the time that has so far elapsed is very short; but the fact\r\nthat this big recurrent growth no longer exists--that it has not\r\nulcerated or sloughed away, but simply, with unbroken covering,\r\ndisappeared--is to me one of the greatest 'surprises' and puzzles that I\r\nhave met with.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPHORICARPUS RACEMOSUS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Caprifoliaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Snow Berry.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--One part of the fresh ripe berries is macerated in two\r\nparts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (In 1882 Dr. Edward V. Moffat read the following paper on\r\n     this remedy before the Homoeopathic Medical Society of\r\n     New York:)\r\n\r\nLet us go back about fifteen years and sketch a history of this drug. At\r\nthat time Prof. S. P. Burdick investigated the medicinal of many plants\r\nhitherto unused by the profession, among others chanced to be the snow\r\nberry, or _Symphoricarpus racemosus_. He gave some of the drug to the\r\nfirst prover, an intelligent lady, who on feeling the marked nausea,\r\nwhich it soon produced, exclaimed: \"Doctor, this is precisely like the\r\nmorning sickness I always experienced during pregnancy.\" Dr. Burdick\r\nbecame more interested, repeated the experiment with other provers,\r\nobtained almost uniform results, viz., a feeling varying from\r\nqualmishness to intense vomiting. It was given to female provers only\r\nand merely tested far enough to verify that symptom.\r\n\r\nUpon this clue Dr. Burdick gave it in the higher potencies to patients\r\nsuffering from the vomiting of pregnancy with most satisfactory results.\r\nIndeed, after a trial of many years, he has found it so far superior to\r\nother remedies that he now relies on it altogether with rarely any but\r\nentirely satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned the drug in his course of lectures, so I bore it in mind\r\nwaiting for a test case. Soon that came in the person of a young lady\r\nthree months advanced in her first pregnancy who was suffering from a\r\ndeathly nausea, with vomiting and retching so prolonged and violent as\r\nto produce haematemesis. The smell or thought of food was repugnant in\r\nthe extreme. An examination disclosed no malposition or apparent cause\r\nfor the trouble, so I procured some _Symphoricarpus_ (200) from Dr.\r\nBurdick and gave her one dose in the midst of a violent paroxysm. In a\r\nfew minutes she stopped vomiting and said she felt soothed and quieted\r\nall over. In half an hour the nausea began again, but a few pellets\r\nchecked it promptly and she fell asleep. Once during the night she awoke\r\ndistressed and took a dose, but slept again quite soon. For a month or\r\nso she felt very well until after over-exerting herself she became\r\nnauseated once more; but it was promptly checked, nor did it return\r\nduring her pregnancy.\r\n\r\nAfter this I had the opportunity of prescribing it in a number of cases\r\nwith such gratifying results that I gave some of the drug to a number of\r\nphysicians, requesting a faithful trial. Among them were my father,\r\nbrother, Dr. Danforth, Dr. McClelland, of Pittsburg, and several others.\r\nAll reported favorably and some enthusiastically, and so I have been led\r\nto bring this subject before this society. The indications as far as I\r\nhave observed them in cases of pregnancy are a feeling of qualmishness\r\nwith indifference to food. In more severe cases, like the above, there\r\nis a deathly nausea; the vomiting is continuous violent retching, but it\r\ncovers every graduation between these extremes; it does not seem to be\r\nconfined to any particular _morning_ aggravation; a prominent symptom is\r\nthe disgust at the sight, smell or thought of food. One case I remember\r\nwhere the patient was comparatively comfortable while lying on the back,\r\nbut would be nauseated by the slightest motion of the arms, particularly\r\nraising them. The case was completely relieved by a few doses. And so\r\nthe cases might be multiplied.\r\n\r\nThinking that if the irritation of pregnancy were thus subdued, that of\r\nmenstruation might be as well, I have given it repeatedly in such cases\r\nof nausea or vomiting just before, during or after catamenia, with\r\nadmirable results.\r\n\r\n\r\nTELA ARANEARUM.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Spider's Web, Cobweb.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Triturate in the usual way.\r\n\r\n     (The following paper is by Dr. S. A. Jones, it was\r\n     published in the _American Observer_, 1876):\r\n\r\nDr. Gillespie, of Edinburgh, \"cured an obstinate intermittent with\r\ncobweb after other means had failed.\" Dr. Robert Jackson was led from\r\nthis to try it himself. He told his success to Dr. Chapman, of\r\nPhiladelphia, who requested one of his pupils, Dr. Broughton, to\r\ninvestigate the subject, which he did, and wrote his Inaugural Thesis\r\nthereon in 1818. From these and other authorities we can gather enough\r\ntestimony to show that it is well worth while to make a systematic\r\nproving of this animal product, thereby predicating its sphere and\r\nprecisioning its employment.\r\n\r\nIn a work on fevers--which particular edition I have not been able to\r\nconsult--Dr. Jackson writes: \"I think I may venture to say that it\r\nprevents the recurrence of febrile paroxysms more abruptly, and more\r\neffectually, than bark or arsenic, or any other remedy employed for that\r\npurpose with which I am acquainted: that, like all other remedies of\r\nthe kind, it is only effectual as applied under a certain condition of\r\nhabit; _but that the condition of susceptibility for cobweb is at the\r\nsame time of more latitude than for any other of the known remedies_.\"\r\n\r\nIf we bear in mind Grauvogl's constitution-classification of _Diadema\r\naranea_ as an hydrogenoid remedy, and recall how generally the\r\nhydrogenoid constitution is induced by intermittent fever, we shall be\r\nready to acknowledge the truth of the passage which I have placed in\r\nitalics, and with this evidence of a truthful beginning we shall be more\r\nready to accept the subsequent testimony.\r\n\r\n\"If the cobweb,\" continues Dr. Jackson, \"was given in the time of\r\nperfect intermission, the return of paroxysm was prevented; if given\r\nunder the first symptoms of a commencing paroxysm, the symptoms were\r\nsuppressed, and the course of the paroxysm was so much interrupted that\r\nthe disease, for the most part, lost its characteristic symptoms. If it\r\nwas not given until the paroxysm was advanced in progress the symptoms\r\nof irritation, viz.: tremors, startings, spasms, and delirium, if such\r\nexisted as forms of febrile action, were usually reduced in violence,\r\nsometimes entirely removed. In this case sleep, calm and refreshing,\r\nusually followed the sudden and perfect removal of pain and irritation.\r\nVomiting, spasms, and twisting in the bowels, appearing as modes of\r\nfebrile irritation, were also usually allayed by it; there was no effect\r\nfrom it where the vomiting or pain was connected with real inflammation\r\nor progress to disorganization.\"\r\n\r\n\"In cases of febrile depression, deficient animation, or indifference to\r\nsurrounding objects, the exhibition of eight or ten grains of cobweb was\r\noften followed by exhilaration: the eyes sparkled; the countenance\r\nassumed a temporary animation, and, though the course of the disease\r\nmight not be changed, or the danger averted, more respite was obtained\r\nthan is gotten from wine, opium, or anything else within my knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"In spasmodic affections of various kinds, in asthma, in periodic\r\nheadaches, in general restlessness and muscular irritabilities its good\r\neffects are often signal. The cobweb gives sleep, but not by narcotic\r\npower;--tranquillity and sleep here appear to be the simple consequence\r\nof release from pain and irritation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The changes induced on the existing state of the system, as the effect\r\nof its operation, characterize it as powerfully stimulant: 1. Where the\r\npulses of the arteries are quick, irregular, and irritated, they become\r\ncalm, regular, and slow, almost instantaneously after the cobweb has\r\npassed into the stomach: the effect is moreover accompanied, for the\r\nmost part, with perspiration and perfect relaxation of the surface. 2.\r\nWhen the pulses are slow, regular, and nearly natural they usually\r\nbecome frequent, small, irregular, sometimes intermitting. 3. When\r\nlanguor and depression characterize the disease, sensations of warmth\r\nand comfort are diffused about the stomach, and increased animation is\r\nconspicuous in the appearance of the eye and countenance.\"\r\n\r\nDr. J. likewise \"effected perfect cures with it in some troublesome\r\nspasmodic affections, and gave it with the most marked benefit in dry,\r\nirritating coughs, usually termed nervous. In the advanced stage of\r\nphthisis it procured a respite beyond his expectation. He also found it\r\nuseful in restraining a troublesome hiccough.\"\r\n\r\nRemembering the fame of _Mygale avicularia_ in chorea we may well expect\r\nthis other spider to be of use \"in some troublesome _spasmodic_\r\naffections.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Chapman writes of it: \"I have cured some obstinate intermittents,\r\nsuspended the paroxysms of hectic, overcome morbid vigilance from\r\nexcessive nervous mobility, and quieted irritation of the system from\r\nother causes, and particularly as connected with protracted coughs and\r\nother chronic pectoral affections. * * * * Some consider it as highly\r\nstimulant, invigorating the force of the pulse, increasing the\r\ntemperature of the surface, and heightening excitement generally--others,\r\nwitnessing no such effects, are disposed to assort it with those\r\nremedies which seem to do good _chiefly by soothing the agitations of\r\nthe system_. I confess that I concur in the latter view of its\r\nproperties.\"\r\n\r\nHow unconsciously the Philistines of Old Physic bear testimony to the\r\ntruth of our therapeutic law. Given where \"heightened excitement\"\r\nobtained, Chapman saw it \"do good chiefly by soothing the agitations of\r\nthe system,\" and to him, of course, cobweb was a sedative.\r\n\r\nDr. Broughton, in his Thesis, says: \"In all the cases of disease in\r\nwhich I have seen or heard of the exhibition of the web, no sensible, or\r\nat least no uniform, operation could be observed. Some patients were\r\nsensible of none, others of a slight sudorific, and some a nauseatic\r\neffect; and one or two thought it proved cathartic after remaining in\r\nthe system for the space of twelve or fifteen hours. These accounts\r\nbeing so incorrect and various, I determined to ascertain (if possible)\r\nthe correct operation by giving the web to healthy persons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I found from these experiments that the operation of the web appeared\r\nprincipally to be upon the arterial system; and perhaps in less time\r\nthan any article already known: the force and frequency of the pulse\r\nbeing uniformly reduced in some cases ten, in others fifteen strokes in\r\na minute; and in one case, the pulse, from being strong and full, became\r\nsoft, small, and very compressible; all which operation took place\r\nwithin the space of two hours, after which time the artery gradually\r\nregained its former force and frequency. This has been the only\r\ninvariable effect I could observe, all others appearing but anomalous.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Thacher cites the following case from a paper of Dr. Jackson's: \"W.\r\nSands has been afflicted for many years with a distressing asthma, which\r\nhas proved fatal to his father and two sisters. The complaint being\r\nhereditary, and aggravated by malformation of the thorax, no remedy gave\r\nany permanent relief, nor did change of climate procure any alleviation\r\nof symptoms. For a considerable time back he has never been able to lie\r\ndown in bed on account of a sense of suffocation, but is obliged to be\r\nsupported half sitting by pillows, and is seldom able to sleep. He\r\nswallowed nearly a scruple of the spider's web, he swallowed it at bed\r\ntime, and to his utter astonishment enjoyed sound and uninterrupted\r\nsleep all night; a blessing to which he had been an entire stranger\r\nabove six years. Since he began with the cobweb thinks his health is\r\nimproved; the cough has certainly abated, but whenever the remedy is\r\nomitted the complaint returns.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Oliver found that \"by the use of this remedy a patient laboring\r\nunder organic disease of the heart and hydrothorax obtained great relief\r\nand refreshing sleep, who had not before slept for three nights.\r\nAnother, under similar affection, experienced uncommon relief from the\r\nsame prescription. To one suffering much pain from cancer it afforded\r\nease and comfortable sleep. A patient in phthisis pulmonalis being\r\naffected with distressing agitation of mind and nervous irritation, it\r\nanswered like a charm, and soon induced great sleep like a moderate dose\r\nof opium.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHALLIUM.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Triturate the pure metal in the usual way.\r\n\r\n     (The following is from the _Homoeopathic World_, 1893):\r\n\r\nIn the \"French News\" column of the _Chemist and Druggist_ we came across\r\na note on the effect of _Thallium_, which we have no doubt homoeopaths\r\nwill soon turn to good account. Here is the paragraph:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS EFFECT OF A REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Huchard read a paper at the last meeting of the Paris Academy of\r\nMedicine on _Acetate of Thallium_, which was formerly advocated by Dr.\r\nCombemale, of Lille, as a medicament against profuse perspiration in\r\ncertain cases of serious illness. It appears, however, that its useful\r\ninfluence is counterbalanced by the fact that it causes the hair to fall\r\noff with great rapidity. Dr. Huchard exhibited at the meeting several\r\nphotographs of patients who had become quite bald in several days. He\r\nwas consequently very emphatic against the use of the remedy.\"\r\n\r\nThere is all the difference between the two schools in this note. To the\r\nallopath this is a \"curious effect\" merely, and serves to condemn the\r\ndrug. To the homoeopathic it brings to light a new remedy for a\r\ntroublesome affection which is by no means too well provided for.\r\n\r\n_Thallium_ is a rare metal, whose atomic weight is 204.2, its symbol\r\nbeing Tl. It receives its name ([Greek: thallos], a green shoot) from\r\nthe green line it gives on the spectrum, through which it was discovered\r\nby Crookes in the residuum left from the distillation of selenium.\r\n_Thallium_ has a bluish white tint and the lustre of lead; is so soft\r\nthat it can be scratched by the finger nail. Specific gravity, 11.8. It\r\nbelongs to the lead group of metals, but has peculiar reactions of its\r\nown. It is used in the manufacture of glass of high refractive power.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHLASPI BURSA PASTORIS.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Cruciferae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Shepherd's Purse.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--Three parts of the fresh plant in flower are macerated in\r\ntwo parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following paper on this remedy is by Dr. E. R.\r\n     Dudgeon and appeared in the _Monthly Homoeopathic\r\n     Review_, 1888):\r\n\r\nThe _Art Medical_, for July, 1888, contains a paper on this plant by Dr.\r\nImbert Gourbeyre, displaying all his well-known ability and erudition.\r\nAlthough an unproved remedy, its sphere of specific action is pretty\r\naccurately known, and in former days it was frequently employed by many\r\neminent medical authorities. In our own days, though almost unknown to\r\n\"scientific\" medicine, it enjoys a considerable reputation in popular\r\nmedicine, chiefly for haemorrhages, and profuse menstruation, and\r\nmetrorrhagia.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dioscorides, it is emmenagogue and abortive,\r\nanti-haemorrhagic, and a remedy for sciatica. In Salmon's _Doren Medicum_\r\n(1683) it is said: \"The seed provokes urine and the courses, kills the\r\n_foetus_, resists poyson, breaks inward apostems, and, being taken in\r\n[Latin: ezh]ij, it purges cholera.\" In Vogel's _Historia Materiae Medicae_\r\nwe read of the seed: \"Ischiaticis infusum prodesse, et menses ciere\r\n(Dioscorides). Sudorem pellere, et ad scorbutum posse, si eb vius\r\nteratur, adiecto saccharo (Boerhaav).\" It was called by the old\r\nherbalists _sanguinaria_--\"quia sanguinem sistet.\" Murray, at the end of\r\nlast century, pronounced it useless; but De Maza, arguing against this\r\nopinion, relates a case of metrorrhagia cured by it, applied as a\r\ncataplasm to the loins, on the recommendation of an old woman, after the\r\ndoctor had tried several medicines without effect. Lejeune (1822) says\r\nhe has seen good results from its employment in haemoptysis.\r\n\r\nRademacher has a great opinion of it. He says: \"This plant was held to\r\nbe an anti-haemorrhagic medicine by the ancients. The superior wisdom of\r\nlater physicians has pronounced it to have no such power, _because it\r\ncontains no astringent principle_! (Carheuser's _Mat. Med._) A second\r\nproperty attributed to it was that of stopping diarrhoea; a third,\r\nthat of cutting short agues. I have lately used it repeatedly in chronic\r\ndiarrhoea, when this is purely a primary affection of the bowels, with\r\nsurprising benefit; but it is useless in consensual diarrhoea. I have\r\nnot yet used it in ague, but would not dissuade others from trying it.\r\nBut the most important remedial power of this common innocuous plant I\r\nlearned from no medical author; the knowledge of it was actually forced\r\nupon me by the following case: I was called to see a poor woman from\r\nwhom, eight or ten years before, I had brought away a large quantity of\r\nurinary sand by means of magnesia and cochineal, and thereby cured her.\r\nNow, the tiresome sand had again accumulated in the kidneys, and the\r\npatient was in a pitiable state. The abdominal cavity was full of water,\r\nthe lower extremities swollen by oedema, and the urine of a bright red\r\ncolor, which formed, on standing, a sediment unmistakably of blood. I\r\nprescribed tincture of _Brusa pastoris_, 30 drops, 5 times a day, solely\r\nwith the intention of stopping the haematuria as a preliminary; but\r\nimagine my astonishment when I found that the tincture caused a more\r\ncopious discharge of renal sand than I had ever witnessed. Paracelsus's\r\nwords occurred to me: 'A physician should overlook nothing; he should\r\nlook down before him like a maiden, and he will find at his feet a more\r\nvaluable treasure for all diseases than India, Egypt, Greece or Barbary\r\ncan furnish.' I should certainly have been a careless fool had I, with\r\nthis striking effect before me, changed to another medicine. I continued\r\nto give the tincture; I saw the urinary secretion increase with the\r\ncopious discharge of sand; the water disappeared from the abdomen and\r\nextremities, and health was restored. I went on with the tincture until\r\nno more sand appeared in the urine, and I had every reason to suppose\r\nthat the deposit of sand was completely removed. Since then I have used\r\nthis remedy in so many cases with success that I can conscientiously\r\nrecommend it to my colleagues as a most reliable remedy. Among these\r\ncases was one which appeared to me very striking. It was that of a\r\nwoman, aged 30, who came to me for a complication of diseases. I\r\nexamined the urine for sand, but found none. I gave her the tincture of\r\n_Brusa pastoris_, and a quantity of sand came away. On continuing the\r\ntincture much more sand came away, and her other morbid symptoms\r\ndisappeared.\"\r\n\r\nIt was stated some time ago that Mattei's _anti-angioitico_ was a\r\ntincture of _Thlaspi bursa pastoris_, but, if we are to credit the\r\nstatement of a periodical lately published, entitled _General Review of\r\nElectro-Homoeopathic Medicine_, this is not so, for _anti-angioitico_\r\nis there stated to be a medicine compounded of _Aconite_, _Belladonna_,\r\n_Nux vomica_, _Veratrum album_, and _Ferrum metallicum_. I mention this\r\ninadvertently, but I do not suppose it is of much consequence, and my\r\nfirst experience of the remedial action of _Thlaspi_ was anterior to the\r\ninformation that it was one of Mattei's remedies.\r\n\r\nIn the 3d volume of the _British Journal of Homoeopathy_, page 63,\r\nthere is an observation taken from the Berlin _Med. Zeit._, to the\r\neffect that Dr. Lange found the greatest benefit from \"a decoction of\r\nthe whole plant in cases of passive haemorrhage generally, and especially\r\nin too frequent and too copious menstruation.\" In the _Zeitsch. f.\r\nErfahrungsheild._, the periodical published by the followers of\r\nRademacher, Dr. Kinil relates the case of a woman who, three weeks after\r\naccouchement, was affected with strangury. She could not retain her\r\nurine, which dribbled away, drop by drop, with constant pain in the\r\nurethra. The urine was turbid and had a deep red sediment. She got 30\r\ndrops of the _tincture of Thlaspi_ five times a day. The strangury\r\ndisappeared at once, the urine could be retained after a few days, and\r\nafter eight days it became clear and without sediment.\r\n\r\nDr. Hannon (_Presse Med. Belge_, 1853) mentions that he had found\r\n_Thlaspi_ very useful in haemorrhage when the blood was poor in fibrine.\r\nDr. Heer (Berlin _Med. Zeit._, 1857) found _Thlaspi_ efficacious in the\r\ndysuria of old persons, when the passage of the urine is painful and\r\nthere is at the same time spasmodic retention of it. On giving the\r\nmedicine, a large quantity of white or red sand is discharged, and the\r\ntroublesome symptoms disappear. Dr. Joussett (_Bull. de la Soc. Hom. de\r\nFrance_, 1866) had a case of haemorrhage, after miscarriage, at three\r\nmonths. He tried _Sabina_, _Secale_, _Crocus_, tampons soaked in\r\nchloride of iron, but all in vain. He consulted Dr. Tessier, who\r\nrecommended him to try _Thlaspi_, 20 drops of the mother tincture in a\r\ndraught; at the second spoonful the haemorrhage ceased. He found it\r\nuseful in haemorrhage with severe uterine colic, with clots of blood, in\r\nthat following miscarriage, in the metrorrhagias at the menopause, and\r\nin those associated with cancer of the neck of the uterus. He found good\r\neffects from the dilutions in some of these cases. Dr. Jousset, in his\r\n_Elements de Med. Prat._, repeats his recommendation of _Thlaspi_ in\r\nhaemorrhages.\r\n\r\nMy own experience of _Thlaspi_ is very small. In one case Dr.\r\nRafinesque, of Paris, cleverly \"wiped my eye,\" to use a sporting term,\r\nwith this medicine. A young French widow was treated by me for a severe\r\nattack of jaundice, from which she made a good recovery. But after this\r\nshe suffered for a couple of months from a very peculiar discharge after\r\nthe catamenial flux. It had the appearance of brownish, grumous blood,\r\nand was attended with obscure abdominal pains. The cervix uteri was\r\nswollen and soft, but not ulcerated. I tried and tried to stop this\r\ndischarge, but without success. She went back to Paris and put herself\r\nunder the care of Dr. Rafinesque, who was her ordinary medical\r\nattendant. He tried several different medicines without any effect on\r\nthe discharge. At last he gave _Thlaspi_, 6th dilution, and this had an\r\nimmediate good effect. Afterwards he gave the mother tincture, 10 drops\r\nin 200 grms. of water, by spoonfuls, and again in the 6th dilution, and\r\nafter keeping her on this medicine for some weeks the discharge was\r\ncompletely cured. The full details of the case will be found in the\r\n_Brit. Journ. of Hom._, vol. 32, p. 370.\r\n\r\nOne other case I have had illustrative of its action in the presence of\r\nexcessive quantities of uric acid in the urine: A lady, aet 76, was under\r\nmy care for a very curious affection. She had considerable rheumatic\r\nmuscular pains in various parts, and constant profuse perspirations day\r\nand night. Along with this she had the most abundant secretion of uric\r\nacid, which passed away with every discharge of urine. Sometimes the\r\nuric acid formed small calculi, which gave much pain in their passage\r\ndown the ureter, but it generally appeared in the form of coarse sand,\r\nwhich formed a thick layer at the bottom of the utensil. This sand\r\ncontinued to pass after the cessation of the sweats and rheumatic pains,\r\nwhich lasted six or seven weeks. I tried various remedies--_Pulsatilla_,\r\n_Picric acid_, _Lycopodium_, etc., but without effect. At last I\r\nbethought me of Rademacher's recommendation of _Thlaspi_, and after a\r\nfew doses of the 1st dilution the sand diminished very much, and,\r\nindeed, sometimes disappeared altogether, and when it did return, it was\r\nin insignificant quantity.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think this medicine deserves a thorough and complete\r\nproving. It is evidently a powerful anti-haemorrhagic, and its influence\r\non the urinary organs, more particularly in bringing away and in curing\r\nexcess of uric acid in the urine, is very remarkable.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere mentioned the power of this substance to affect the\r\nsecretion of uric acid, and then I have seen several cases corroborative\r\nof its medicinal virtues in this direction. One, a gentleman, aet. 57,\r\nwho, in addition to other dyspeptic symptoms, had occasionally large\r\ndischarges of coarse uric acid, coming away in masses the size of a good\r\nbig pin's head, but curiously enough without pain. I prescribed\r\n_Thlaspi_, which he said soon stopped the uric acid. Nearly a year after\r\nthis he called on me for a different affection, and informed me that the\r\nuric acid had reappeared several times in his urine, but that a few\r\ndoses of _Thlaspi_ 1 stopped it, and it never came to the height it\r\nattained when I first gave it to him. A lady, nearly eighty years of\r\nage, was suffering from the pressure of a calculus in the left ureter,\r\nwhich I knew to be of uric acid, as she had previously passed much\r\n'sand.' The urine showed no sand, and was very scanty. I tried several\r\nremedies, among the rest the Borocitrate of magnesia, but it was not\r\ntill I gave _Thlaspi_ 1 that a great discharge of coarse brick-colored\r\nsand took place, with speedy relief to her pain. At the same time,\r\nindeed, I made her drink copiously of distilled water, which has a\r\npowerfully disintegrating effect on uric acid sometimes, but, as she had\r\nalready been taking this for several days without effect, I am inclined\r\nto give the whole credit of the cure to _Thlaspi_.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone in such cases that _Thlaspi_ is useful. Its ancient use\r\nas a haemostatic has been confirmed in modern times and in my own\r\nexperience, and my friend, Dr. Harper, related to me lately a most\r\ninteresting cure he had effected by its means of a very prolonged and\r\nserious affection. The case was that of an elderly lady who for years\r\nhad suffered from a large discharge of muco-pus, sometimes mixed with\r\nblood, sometimes apparently nearly all blood, which poured from the\r\nbowels after each evacuation. She had been many months under the medical\r\ntreatment of the late Dr. D. Wilson, who at last told her he considered\r\nher disease incurable. She then put herself under the treatment of a\r\npractitioner who relies chiefly on oxygen gas for his cures; but she was\r\nno better--rather worse--after his treatment. She then came to Dr.\r\nHarper, who worked away at her with all the ordinary remedies without\r\ndoing a bit of good. At last he bethought him of _Thlaspi_, led thereto\r\nby my remarks on its anti-haemorrhagic properties in my \"therapeutic\r\nnotes\" in _The Monthly Homoeopathic Review_ of October, 1888, and he\r\nfound that, from the time she commenced using this remedy, the discharge\r\nfrom the bowels gradually declined and ultimately ceased, and there has\r\nbeen no return of it.\r\n\r\nNo doubt _Thlaspi_ is a great remedy, and until it is satisfactorily\r\nproved, we may employ it with advantage in cases similar to those I have\r\nmentioned. But it is to be hoped that some of our colleagues endowed\r\nwith youth, health and zeal, will ere long favor us with a good proving\r\nof it, whereby its curative powers may be precisionized. At present we\r\nonly partially know these from the less satisfactory results of clinical\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n     (The following is from a paper by Dr. Millie J. Chapman\r\n     in Transactions of American Institute of Homoeopathy,\r\n     1897:)\r\n\r\nThe provings are brief and do not furnish very full indications for its\r\nuse. However, from them we learn of its effectiveness in expelling\r\naccumulations of sand and uric-acid crystals from the kidneys and\r\nbladder, also in controlling hemorrhage from the nose, kidneys, or\r\nuterus.\r\n\r\nMy attention was first called to this remedy in cases of sub-involution\r\nfollowing either abortion or labor at full term, where it many a time\r\ninduced recovery.\r\n\r\nI have since witnessed equal success in hemorrhage from uterine fibroid\r\nwhere the flow was controlled, and the growth was greatly reduced in\r\nsize before the age of the individual would naturally produce these\r\nchanges. Also uterine hemorrhage, attended with cramps and expulsion of\r\nclots, has been relieved by it after curetting had failed.\r\n\r\nA member of the Women's Provers' Association took five drops of the\r\ntincture three times a day for ten days. This was followed by a great\r\nincrease of urine and a menstrual flow lasting fifteen days. She became\r\nalarmed and could not be persuaded to continue the proving.\r\n\r\nAnother took ten drops, three times a day, for five days, when the\r\nquantity of urine and brick dust deposit were so unusual that her\r\ninterest in scientific investigation suddenly ceased.\r\n\r\nAbout a year since, there came for treatment a patient who had suffered\r\nlong from both disease and treatment of the bladder. _Thlaspi_ 2x and\r\nlater five drop doses of the tincture expelled great quantities of sand,\r\nand was followed by complete relief of the bladder symptoms and the\r\ndisappearance of rheumatic pains that had been supposed incurable.\r\n\r\nAnother case of similar bladder irritation and marked evidences of gout\r\nwas promptly relieved.\r\n\r\n_Thlaspi_ also has a reputation in the cure of urethritis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHYROID.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The dried thyroid gland of the sheep is triturated in the\r\nusual way or an extract may be prepared from the fresh gland.\r\n\r\n     (The following paper on the effects of _Thyroid_ was\r\n     written by Dr. F. G. OEhme, Roseburg, Oregon:)\r\n\r\nThe _Thyroid_, especially if used continually or in large doses,\r\n_causes_ the following _symptoms_:\r\n\r\n1. Elevation of the temperature.\r\n\r\n2. Increase of the heart's action and of the frequency and volume of the\r\npulse, which, however, is more compressible. Walking, even standing,\r\nafter taking a dose is apt to cause a feeling of faintness and even\r\ncomplete syncope. The heart may become so weak that it cannot endure any\r\noverexertion without danger, even death may result.\r\n\r\n3. Shortness of breath.\r\n\r\n4. Increase or decrease of appetite, sometimes nausea, less frequently\r\nvomiting, still less diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n5. Improvement in body nutrition generally, more complete absorption of\r\nnitrogenous food. But later on nitrogen is excreted in excess of that\r\ntaken in the food.\r\n\r\n6. Loss of weight.\r\n\r\n7. Increase of sexual desire.\r\n\r\n8. Menses profuse, prolonged or more frequent, rarely amenorrhoea.\r\n\r\n9. Increased activity of the mucous membrane, kidneys and skin, which\r\nbecomes moist and oily, sometimes exfoliation of the epidermis.\r\n\r\n10. Rapid growth of the skeleton in the young with softening and bending\r\nof those bones which have to bear weight.\r\n\r\n11. A disease closely resembling exophthalmic goitre. A cataleptic\r\nimproved under large doses of _Thyroid_, but when the dose of 75 grs. a\r\nday was reached symptoms like those of exophthalmic goitre developed\r\nwith a pulse of 160, but no glandular swelling. When the _Thyroid_ was\r\ndiscontinued the catalepsy grew worse, the exophthalmic goitre better;\r\nwhen resumed the catalepsy better, the exophthalmic goitre worse.\r\n\r\nA patient, while under _Thyroid_ treatment for myxoedema, took,\r\nthrough a misunderstanding, in eleven days nearly 3 ounces of the\r\ndessicated _Thyroid_, whereupon tachycardia, pyrexia, insomnia, tremor\r\nof the limbs, polyuria, albuminuria, and glucosuria, in short, a disease\r\nsimilar to exophthalmic goitre developed.\r\n\r\n_Thyroid_ has been _used_ with benefit in the following _diseases_:\r\n\r\n1.

The least\r\neffort or exertion will increase it even to 160, hence some cases should\r\nbe kept in bed or at least very quiet and tranquil even for a time after\r\nthe remedy has been discontinued. Deaths have taken place after a few\r\ndays' treatment.\r\n\r\nIf _Thyroid_ is not taken for myxoedema the patient should be weighed\r\nat least every two weeks, and if pathogenetic symptoms, called\r\nthyroidism, appear the remedy should be discontinued or reduced.\r\n\r\nIf softening of the bones has been caused it may be necessary to\r\nrestrict the use of the legs or to use splints.\r\n\r\n_Thyroid_ seems to have a cumulative effect.\r\n\r\nIn many cases a liberal diet should be prescribed to avoid injurious\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRYCHOSANTHES DIOICA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Cucurbitaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Patal.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--One part of the entire fresh plant is macerated in two\r\nparts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (In 1893 H. L. Saha, homoeopathic practitioner, Pabna,\r\n     Bengal, sent the following to _Hom. Recorder_:)\r\n\r\n_Trychosanthes dioica_ (Bengali name, Patal). It belongs to the order of\r\n_Cucurbitaeae_, is a creeper, flowering in all seasons, but chiefly in\r\nspring. It is a native of Bengal. Its fruit is called Patal, and is used\r\nby the natives as one of their chief curry.\r\n\r\nThe plant and its root are used by the native physicians in various\r\nmaladies. Its action is mainly upon the liver and intestines. The\r\ndecoction of the root is generally used by the mother physicians for\r\nremoving costiveness, especially where there is a derangement of the\r\nfunctions of the liver.\r\n\r\nA boy of fourteen years of age, who had habitual constipation, took, at\r\nthe advice of a quack native physician, about three or four ounces of\r\nthe decoction of its root, which produced profuse diarrhoea. After\r\nfour or five stools I was called. I saw him weak and dejected, using\r\nabusive language to his native physician. His face was very pale. Stools\r\nwere profuse, frequent, gushing, yellowish, watery. Much pain and\r\ncutting about the umbilicus during and before stool. After every stool\r\nhe felt dizziness of the brain. This case struck me that _Trychosanthes\r\ndioica_ will prove a grand remedy for diarrhoea. I prepared its\r\ntincture from the root and used it in 3x potency, in some cases with\r\ngreat satisfaction. The following cases will show its curative power:\r\n\r\n1. A girl, aged 6 years, was attacked with diarrhoea; stools were\r\nprofuse, thin, yellowish, watery, mixed with little white mucous; very\r\noffensive smell; cutting pain about umbilicus during and after stool.\r\nPain in liver and eyes; jaundice; face yellowish; very weak; did not\r\nwish to answer questions: sad and peevish. On the fifth day I was\r\ncalled. I prescribed _Trychosanthes dioica_ 3x every three hours. I saw\r\nthe patient much better next day. Within a day or two the patient was\r\nall right.\r\n\r\n2. A boy, aged 16 years, suffering from chronic diarrhoea; passed from\r\nfour to five stools in a day. The character of the stool was yellowish,\r\nwatery, mixed with a little white and greenish mucus. Smell offensive;\r\ndull, aching pain in the region of the liver. Face very pale; eyes\r\njaundiced. He was very sad and dejected. His appetite little; taste\r\nbitter. He had been at first treated by an allopath, then, afterwards,\r\nby a homoeopath. The latter showed some improvement. I was called on\r\nthe thirteenth day, when I noticed the above symptoms. I prescribed\r\n_Trychosanthes_ 3x every four hours. The patient was completely cured\r\nwithin four days.\r\n\r\nI cured some cases of choleric diarrhoea by this medicine, but those\r\ncases were vaguely reported to me.\r\n\r\nI hope that, when proven, _Trychosanthes dioica_ will show its large\r\nsphere of action and give our Materia Medica a new remedy for looseness\r\nof bowels.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSNEA BARBATA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Lichens.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--The fresh lichen is macerated in five times its weight of\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\n     (This appeared in No. 284 of the _U. S. Med.\r\n     Investigator_ signed \"---- M. D.\"):\r\n\r\nIn March, 1878, I was cutting wood. I cut down a soft maple; the top was\r\nwell loaded with moss. It attracted my attention; I viewed it closely. I\r\nate a little, about the size of a hickory nut, as I trimmed up my tree.\r\nMy head began to ache. I cut off one log, and had to go to the house. I\r\ncould feel the blood press to the brain. My wife worked over me, and I\r\ngot to sleep. Next morning felt well; never felt better. I did not think\r\nof the moss I had eaten. I went on a visit and was gone five days. On my\r\nreturn I went to my tree. The first sight of it reminded me of my\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\nI gathered some of the moss and made a tincture. I soon had a case of\r\nheadache to try my remedy on; it stopped at once.\r\n\r\nIn the fall, about September, a load of young folks came to pick\r\ncranberries. Two of the young ladies had headache from riding in the hot\r\nsun. Both took to the lounge. Now for my remedy. I put one drop of\r\ntincture in a goblet of water, gave a teaspoonful; ordered another in\r\nfifteen minutes. The second dose stopped the pain.\r\n\r\nA young married lady came on a visit to a relative--was having pains in\r\nher head. I was sent for; found her wild with pain. She said she had\r\nbeen subject to headache for five years; had got tired of doctoring.\r\nGave her one drop in a cup of water, teaspoonful in twenty minutes; no\r\nmore pain. I put ten drops in a two-drachm vial of alcohol, directed her\r\nto take one drop when she felt her headache coming on. One year after\r\nshe wrote her friend it had cured headache; sent thanks to me.\r\n\r\nI could give many more cases where the pain is over the entire head, or\r\nfront head, with a feeling as if the temples would burst or the eyes\r\nwould burst out of their sockets. I have always used the tincture. I\r\nhave not noticed any other effect from it; would like to see a proving.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERBENA HASTATA.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Verbenaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAMES, Blue Vervain, Purvain, Wild Hyssop.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--One part of the fresh plant, in flower, is macerated in\r\ntwo parts by weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (An extract from a paper by Dr. J. N. White, Queen City,\r\n     Texas, detailing at length the case of a five-year-old\r\n     boy, who, after six weeks of whooping cough, developed\r\n     epileptic symptoms, having as high as twelve spasms in\r\n     twenty-four hours. After two months of treatment with\r\n     such remedies as _Solanum Car._, _Sulphonal_,\r\n     _Hyoscyamus_, _Cannabis Ind._, _Calomel_, _Zinc_, etc.,\r\n     with no results, the case was given _Verbena hastata_.\r\n     Another doctor was in consultation and we quote:)\r\n\r\nI told my friend (the Doctor) that when he became satisfied with the\r\nzinc treatment I wanted to try another eclectic remedy. (The Doctor was\r\nan allopath.) He was perfectly willing and I put him on _Verbena\r\nhastata_, 12 minims every four hours, skipping the dose at midnight.\r\nAfter we both took the case we decided, as there were no curative\r\nproperties in the sulfonal, we would drop it, and not use anything to\r\ncontrol the paroxysms, and consequently the boy seemed to get worse to\r\nthe parents, as he would have several falling spells a day. From the\r\nfirst dose of the _Verbena hastata_ the boy began to improve. He would\r\nhave contractions of the muscles of the arms and legs and look wild for\r\na minute or more for the first week, but after that he never had another\r\nsymptom. We kept him on the medicine, as above, for six weeks, and now\r\nhe takes twelve drops three times a day.\r\n\r\nHe has not had any symptom in over two months, and all that wild vacant\r\nlook is gone, and he plays, eats, sleeps, etc., as if he had never been\r\ntroubled with epilepsy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISCUM ALBUM.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Loranthaceae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Mistletoe.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--One part of the fresh leaves and berries is macerated in\r\ntwice its weight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following account of this ancient remedy was\r\n     published in the _Allgemeine Hom. Zeitung_, 1886:)\r\n\r\n_The Grand Universal Panacea of the old Gauls and Germans._--By _Dr. v.\r\nGerstel_, of Regensburg.--This parasite shrub belongs to the 22d class,\r\nLinne, is found on various trees, and was prized above all others as a\r\nhealing remedy in the Gallic and German antiquity. The Druids--their\r\npriests--were at the same time naturalists, metaphysicians, doctors and\r\nsorcerers, and to the mistletoe growing on oaks were ascribed, above all\r\nother plants, marvelous healing powers. That the oak mistletoe was\r\nprized above all those growing on fruit or other trees, as a remedy, may\r\nbe due to the fact that in ancient times all oaks and oak groves were\r\nregarded with a holy veneration, being considered the favorite abodes of\r\nthe old German deities. The mistletoe growing on oaks was therefore\r\nvenerated by the ancient Gauls and Germans as the holiest of heaven-sent\r\ngifts to mankind. It was applied in all diseases, and without it no\r\nreligious service could be conducted. From the Germanic mythology we\r\nknow that as a priest--a Druid--discovered a mistletoe growing on an\r\noak, he at once called up all the brethren of his order of the\r\nneighborhood. They doffed the many-colored garments in daily use, and\r\ndonned flowing white robes as a sign of humility in the presence of the\r\ndivine plant. The highest in rank approached the tree provided with a\r\ngolden sickle, bent his knees, and was then lifted by his companions on\r\nhigh until he could reach the plant. This was then cut with the golden\r\nsickle and prepared and preserved for sacred and for healing purposes.\r\n\r\nIf it could be secured six days after the new moon, the most exhalted\r\nhealing properties were attributed to it, and it was at once made into a\r\npotion which, mixed with the blood of steers that had never done any\r\nwork and which had been immolated beneath the oaks, formed a draught\r\nwhich brought blessings, fruitfulness, health and prosperity to all who\r\ncould partake of it.\r\n\r\nAs at that time, and for a long time after, the origin and propagation\r\nof the parasitic plant was unknown, it was surrounded with a magic halo,\r\nand by virtue of its undoubted healing qualities, especially in gout,\r\nrheumatism, nerve pains of various kinds, neuralgias, especially of the\r\nrheumatic and gouty variety, as well as of its close affinity with and\r\ninfluence upon the female sexual system, it was accorded the highest\r\nrank among all remedies by the Priestesses, the female Druids.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1857-58, I passed one year in the town of Steger, in\r\nupper Austria, as physician to Prince Lamberg; there I became well\r\nacquainted with Dr. W. Huber, at the time physician to the\r\nHomoeopathic Hospital of the \"Sisters of Mercy,\" and found in him also\r\nan antiquary of considerable learning. His researches brought to his\r\nnotice in what high veneration the mistletoe was held by the ancient\r\nGermans and Gauls and its employment as a universal healing remedy. Dr.\r\nHuber, who was a man of unusual intelligence and of high scientific\r\nacquirements, desired to learn the true sphere of action of this\r\nimportant remedy, and preparing a mother-tincture from the\r\nmistletoe--_lege artis_--he proved the several dilutions on himself and\r\nothers, men and women, thus truly following the example of Hahnemann and\r\nhis disciples. I still possess some of this identical tincture as\r\nprepared by Dr. Huber, who, I am grieved to say, died suddenly of\r\napoplexy during my sojourn, in the year 1858.\r\n\r\nDr. Huber carefully collated all the symptoms experienced by his\r\nprovers; he had a great predilection for the mistletoe, which he\r\nprescribed in many different ailments. He frequently conversed with me\r\nabout its healing properties, and often gave it in his hospital and in\r\nhis private practice. He used it chiefly in the 3d and 6th decimal\r\ndilution. According to Dr. Huber, the symptoms of _Viscum album_ are\r\nsimilar to those of _Aconite_, _Bryonia_, _Pulsatilla_, _Rhododendron_,\r\n_Rhus_ and _Spigelia_, _i.e._, are in accord with our foremost\r\nanti-arthritic and anti-rheumatic remedies. _Viscum_ has symptoms in\r\ncommon with each of these remedies, and is thus particularly useful in\r\ngouty and rheumatic complaints, in acute as well as in chronic cases;\r\nmore particularly in those having _tearing pains_ in no matter what part\r\nof the body. It follows well after _Aconite_ in acute rheumatism. It is\r\nalso very effective in different neuralgias of a gouty or rheumatic\r\norigin, as in ischias, prosopalgia, periostitis, and especially in\r\nearache, tearing pains in the ears, and otitis. It is a sovereign remedy\r\nin rheumatic deafness. As _causa excitans_ of diseases amenable to it\r\nmay be regarded high winds, _i.e._, all gouty, rheumatic or other\r\nailments which, similarly to _Rhus_ and _Rhododendron_, are aggravated\r\nby sharp north or northwest winds, such as we have in winter. For this\r\nreason _Viscum_ is more often applicable in the colder season than in\r\nsummer, or at time when gouty or rheumatic affections or pains are\r\nusually aggravated. It has also been found beneficial in asthmatic\r\ncomplaints if connected with gout or rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThe mistletoe moreover stands in a peculiarly close relation to the\r\nfemale sexual system (uterus), and especially to the climacteric period,\r\nwhen women cease to menstruate and chronic or periodical haemorrhages are\r\noften met with. _Viscum_ also promotes labor pains similarly to\r\n_Pulsatilla_ and _Secale_, and is especially efficient in effecting the\r\nexpulsion of the placenta, also in incarcerated placenta.\r\n\r\nWhen the great army of gouty and rheumatic ailments which may befall all\r\nparts of the body are taken into consideration, as well as the manifold\r\nsufferings originating in the female sexual system, which manifest\r\nthemselves as menorrhagias as well as amenorrhoea, but more often are\r\ncaused by congestive states,--when we consider the powerful influence of\r\nthe mistletoe on these forms of diseases as brought out by the careful\r\nhomoeopathic provings on the healthy, is it to be marvelled at that\r\nthe old Gauls and Germans venerated it, by whose mysterious origin they\r\nwere overawed, as a sovereign remedy for their ailments and sufferings,\r\nas a sacred gift presented by the gods of mankind?\r\n\r\n     (The following clinical case is from _Hom. World_, 1876,\r\n     by Dr. Ivatts:)\r\n\r\nOctober 24, 1875.--T. H----, aet. about fifty. Rheumatism for the last\r\nsix years of ankle, wrists, and knuckle joints, also pains across the\r\nlumbar muscles. Extreme distress on motion, with weariness and pain.\r\nGreat pain in walking. Worse on commencing to move, but after continuing\r\nthe movement for a time the pain diminishes. No pain when at rest except\r\nwhen warm in bed, when the ankle and wrist joints are occasionally very\r\nbad. Patient holds a degree L.R.C.S.I., but has relinquished practice\r\nfor fifteen years and travelled abroad. Never could get relief from the\r\nrheumatism.--_Viscum album_ No. 1, five drops twice a day. November\r\n14.--After taking medicine for ten days the weary feeling gradually\r\ndiminished, and the muscular motion became free from distress. Has now\r\ncontinued medicine for three weeks, and he says, \"I am quite free from\r\nrheumatic pains.\" February 18, 1876.--Saw patient to-day, and he tells\r\nme he has continued quite free from the rheumatic pains since November.\r\n\r\n     (Dr. E. M. Holland wrote as follows concerning the\r\n     remedy, _Medical Summary_, 1898:)\r\n\r\nMy first case of child birth in which I used _Mistletoe_ (_Viscum\r\nalbum_) was May 30, 1897. Was called to see Mrs. C.; second confinement;\r\nthere was but little advancement; I sent the husband to my office, three\r\nblocks away, for some _Mistletoe_, and I gave the lady half a\r\nteaspoonful with a swallow of water every twenty minutes, and before one\r\nhour had passed labor was on in good shape, and in half an hour longer\r\nall was over.\r\n\r\nI returned to my office, and in less than half an hour I was called to\r\nsee a colored woman, much of a lady, mother of two children; on\r\nexamination I found only a slight advancement of the child, mouth of the\r\nwomb but little dilated. I learned that she had been just about the same\r\nfor twelve hours. I prepared a mixture and ordered a teaspoonful every\r\ntwenty minutes; this dose contained 30 drops of the _Mistletoe_. I was\r\nnot well, and returned to my office, leaving instructions to notify me\r\nwhen labor was well on; my office was four blocks from her residence. I\r\nreclined on a lounge, intending to return in about an hour, but dropped\r\ninto a doze, and in about one and a half hours the husband came on the\r\nrun, notwithstanding they had sent a little girl for me. He reached my\r\noffice panting, and exclaimed: 'For God's sake, hurry, for her insides\r\nhave all come out.' On my arrival, I found the child and afterbirth all\r\nin a pile. The confusion was soon calmed down by the assurance that all\r\nwas well.\r\n\r\nSoon after this I was called to see Mrs. M., the mother of seven\r\nchildren. I had been with her in six of the seven confinements, and\r\nknowing that she had always been tedious I gave the messenger a small\r\nvial of the same mixture and same dose, labelled it teaspoonful every\r\ntwenty minutes, stating that I would be there in an hour or two, and I\r\nwas; but the child was born about fifteen minutes before.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th day of July of the present year I was called to attend Mrs.\r\nB. in her third labor, some two miles in the country. I left home at\r\n3:30 A.M. When I arrived at the house I found nothing to indicate that I\r\nwould be permitted to return home sooner than--I will say a number of\r\nhours. I found presentation all right, some dilatation, but there was\r\nbut little advancement. The pains seemed to be of excruciating\r\ncharacter, but not the kind to do more than wear the patient out. She\r\ntold me that the same kind of pains had been on for a day and night, so\r\nI continued with the _Mistletoe_ in half-teaspoonful doses every twenty\r\nminutes. Pains came on; in just one hour her extreme agony ceased. Labor\r\ncame on, and in half an hour more the child was born.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the placenta came readily and everything progressed\r\nwell after birth. I said I left my office at 3:30 A.M., and I was at\r\nhome again by 7 A.M. It may be that four cases are not sufficient to\r\ndecide on the merits of a remedy, but the change was so decided and\r\nprompt that I am satisfactorily convinced that in _Mistletoe_ we have an\r\noxytocic that is superior to all remedies hitherto tried.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing was compiled, Dr. George Black's exceedingly\r\ninteresting brochure of 79 pages, _Viscum album, the Common Mistletoe_,\r\netc., etc., appeared, and anyone wanting a complete history of the drug\r\nshould procure a copy.\r\n\r\nDr. Black (Torquay, England) publishes all the known provings, and in\r\naddition some very thorough ones conducted by himself; from these we\r\nselect the following striking symptoms:\r\n\r\nProll experienced a sensation as if a large spider were crawling over\r\nhis hands; a glow rising from feet to head, and he seemed to be on fire,\r\nthough his face was pale, this repeatedly; also violent aching pain in\r\nright foot recurring frequently. Proving with the tincture in increasing\r\ndoses up to 40 drops.\r\n\r\nTwo women took the drug to produce abortion; every muscle of the body\r\nwas paralyzed, including bowels, save those of the eye, and both died on\r\nthe 8th and 9th day, starved to death.\r\n\r\nThe provings by Dr. Black. A well-built woman, aged twenty, took\r\nrepeated doses of the drug from [Greek: theta] up to 30th. The most\r\nstriking symptoms were: Sudden, severe thumps of the heart that then\r\nwent on beating at a tremendous rate; it slowed down and was followed by\r\ntrembling in the limbs; after this was very marked jerking of the limbs,\r\nand twitching; hot feeling, though not actually hot. \"A feeling as if I\r\nshould bite some one if I did not keep my teeth clenched. A wretched\r\nfeeling as if I should do something awfully wrong if I did not keep\r\nmyself under control.\" Several months later the effect of the drug was\r\nstill strongly in evidence; \"thinks she will go out of her mind, feels\r\nas if she would have an epileptic fit, says she would feel far happier\r\nin an asylum.\"\r\n\r\nA second prover, Mrs.---- aet 37, experienced jerking and twitchings of\r\nthe muscles, shooting pains in left ovarian region, and, on movement,\r\nlumbar pain and stiffness. Proving made with 3d dilution.\r\n\r\nThird prover, aet 27, a woman. First marked symptom was a shooting pain\r\nin left ovary; then pain and twitching in leg, when aching stopped it\r\nfelt very hot; aching repeated, and only relief was shifting the\r\nposition of the leg to a cool place in the bed; again a dreadful pain in\r\nthe region of the left ovary--\"a fearful aching\" \"it was a pain you\r\ncouldn't have put up with long without doing something;\" later: \"I have\r\nhad no pain, but a great twitching in my hands and legs for a long time,\r\njust like a person with chorea--first my left hand jumped, then both\r\nlegs, my heart seemed to beat very fast.\" \"When hands were held it\r\nseemed to alleviate the jerking and twitching.\" The pain in ovaries,\r\nalso in other parts of the body at times, the twitchings and jerkings,\r\nand the frequent hot feeling continued during all the proving. It was\r\nmade with the 3d and [Greek: theta].\r\n\r\nThe fourth proving was made by Dr. Black himself, chiefly with the 3x\r\nand [Greek: theta].\r\n\r\nThis proving is quite long. From it we note the following symptoms:\r\nSevere pain in right shoulder joint. Muscular twitching in right leg.\r\nDull pain under left false ribs. Neuralgic pain in sciatic nerve. Back,\r\nlumbar region, stiff and weak. Pain in right knee joint, painful to move\r\nand tender to the touch. Weight and oppression of the heart, with\r\ngripping feeling as if a hand were squeezing it; the load seemed to\r\nlift, with great relief, but came back again. A curious sensation of\r\ntickling about the heart. Twinges of pain in the great toes. The last\r\nrecord some days after ceasing the proving reads as follows: \"I think it\r\nwas the same night as the previously recorded symptoms that I went to\r\nbed between 12 and 1 o'clock, and after lying down experienced a curious\r\ngeneral tremor through my body, as if all the muscles were in a state of\r\nfibrillary contraction; not a single involuntary jerk, nor the continued\r\ntwitching of the muscle or a portion of one, but a general state\r\naffecting the whole body. It lasted until I fell asleep.\"\r\n\r\nTherapeutically the drug has been used for palsy, \"incompetency and\r\ntumultuous distressing cardiac action,\" mitral disease, chorea,\r\nepilepsy, retention of placenta, catarrhal deafness, menorrhagia,\r\nsciatica, rheumatism, periostitis, hydrothorax, and transient deafness.\r\n\r\nThe Druids sweepingly asserted that it would \"heal all diseases.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWYETHIA HELENIOIDES.\r\n\r\nNAT. ORD., Compositae.\r\n\r\nCOMMON NAME, Californian compass plant.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION.--One part of the fresh root is macerated in two parts by\r\nweight of alcohol.\r\n\r\n     (The following, by Dr. J. M. Selfridge, Oakland, Cal.,\r\n     was published in _Pacific Coast Journal of\r\n     Homoeopathy_, April, 1899:)\r\n\r\nThere is probably no State in the Union where there is a greater number\r\nof valuable remedies to be found than in the State of California. These\r\nremedies are waiting to be proved by those of us who have sufficient\r\nenthusiasm and who are willing to take the trouble and make what\r\nsacrifice is necessary to accomplish so desirable a result. I know it\r\nhas been said that we have too many remedies which have not been\r\nproperly proven. While this is doubtless true, it is equally true that\r\nmany of the new remedies which have been introduced within the memory of\r\nsome of us are absolutely indispensable in the treatment of certain\r\nforms of disease.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason why these California remedies should become a\r\npart of our armamentarium. It is claimed by Teste and others that where\r\ncertain forms of disease prevail there, or in that vicinity, the\r\ncurative remedy may be found.\r\n\r\nAgain, it has been said that there is a remedy somewhere in nature for\r\nevery ill to which flesh is heir.\r\n\r\nWhether this be true or not, we know there are certain diseases, which,\r\nso far as we are aware, are incurable, for the simple reason that we\r\nknow of no remedy that will control the abnormal conditions. This being\r\ntrue, the incentive ought to be sufficiently great to urge us forward in\r\nthe line of knowing more than we now know of the wealth of those\r\nremedies that lie at our very doors. All we know of these drugs, so\r\nfar, are mere hints which have been given us by the older inhabitants of\r\nthe Coast.\r\n\r\nThus, the _Eriodictyon Californicum_ or \"Yerba Santa,\" has been\r\nsuggested for the cure of \"poison oak\" and for certain bronchial\r\naffections. A partial proving of it was made some years ago under the\r\nsupervision of the late Dr. Pease, which can be found in \"Allen's\r\nEncyclopaedia,\" Vol. iv., page 218.\r\n\r\nThe _Micromeria Douglassi_, or \"Yerba Bueno,\" is another plant which\r\nshould be proved. Many years ago a friend of mine was suffering with a\r\nseries of boils, when an old \"Spanish woman\" directed him to make a tea\r\nof this plant. This he did, and cured his boils; but, as the tea had an\r\nagreeable taste, he continued to drink it, believing, as some do, \"that\r\nif little was good, more was better,\" until finally he became so weak he\r\ncould not continue his work.\r\n\r\nIt was one of these hints that induced me some years ago to make a\r\nproving of _Wyethia Helenioides_, or \"poison weed.\" Like many other\r\nprovings, it was only partial. A schema of it was published in \"Allen's\r\nEncyclopaedia,\" Vol. x., page 168.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago an attempt was made to secure additional symptoms, which\r\nare given below in the language of the provers, who at that time were\r\nmembers of the \"Organon and Materia Medica Club of the Bay Cities.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of the proving, the potency and the drug were unknown to the\r\nprovers.\r\n\r\nI. \"June 9th, 1896, began taking----, of which I took a drop in a\r\nteaspoonful of water before each meal.

(S.)\r\n\r\nIII. \"June 8th, 1896, commenced taking remedy given by Dr. Selfridge,\r\none drop three times a day before meals.\r\n\r\n\"June 13th.--After a restless night, awakened at 7:30 A.M. with severe,\r\nsharp pain in the right tonsil; throat felt swollen and sore; tonsil red\r\nand inflamed; glands on right side of neck swollen and sore to touch.\r\n\r\n\"At 9:30, neuralgic pains commenced in left arm and hand, then in back,\r\nlimbs and all over the body; skin felt sore to touch; was quite ill all\r\nday, with no appetite whatever.\r\n\r\n\"At 7:30 P.M. commenced to feel chilly; upon the slightest movement\r\nchills would creep up the back, with increase of pain; grew colder and\r\ncolder; was very ill, and went to bed. At 9:30 fever commenced with\r\ndesire for food; head very hot; cheeks very red and burning; temperature\r\n102 deg., but still very chilly. Passed a very restless night, with chill,\r\nfever and sweat all at the same time, with constant twinges of pain all\r\nover the body, particularly in back and limbs; could not bear the\r\nslightest touch.\r\n\r\n\"June 14th.--Temperature 101-1/2 deg. at 8 A.M. Right tonsil and glands of\r\nneck still very sore, in fact, worse; pains over body less, though back\r\nquite sore and lame; felt very weak and unable to remain out of bed.\r\n\r\n\"Still continued the remedy. All symptoms gradually improved, and was\r\nentirely well in a few days.\r\n\r\n\"June 20th.--Stopped taking the remedy on advice of Dr. Selfridge.\r\n\r\n\"June 21st.--Very depressed, both mentally and physically; menses\r\ncommenced at 2:30 P.M., with slight uterine pain. Retired at 10 o'clock,\r\nwhen the pain became intense and burning. Suffered all night, the pain\r\nbeing constant, though increasing in paroxysms with sensation as if the\r\nuterus expanded in order to keep all the pain within its walls. Could\r\ndistinctly outline the contour of the uterus. Never had such a pain\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"June 22nd.--Pain much better, but still a paroxysm every little while.\r\nFelt very weak all day and mentally depressed.\r\n\r\n\"When menses ceased, observed no further symptoms.\r\n\r\n\"July 4th.--Commenced the remedy again.\r\n\r\n\"July 18th.--At 11 A.M. commenced to feel chilly, with aching pains all\r\nover the body, which gradually grew worse until 12 o'clock, when a most\r\nsevere chill took place; shook all over; aching over body and headache\r\nintense. Took no more of the remedy; went to bed, and as I was growing\r\nworse, was given _Aconite_ at 1 o'clock. There was great thirst for ice\r\nwater during the entire chill, which lasted until 2:30 P.M., when fever\r\ncame on; temperature, 101 deg.; no thirst. In about fifteen minutes\r\ncommenced to sweat. Temperature at 4 o'clock 100 deg.; still sweating. At 10\r\nP.M. menses commenced; no uterine pain, but still aching all over body\r\nwhich continued all night, preventing sleep; pains worse in limbs and\r\nback; at times jerking in character, making me start with every twinge;\r\nprofuse sweating all night.\r\n\r\n\"July 19th.--Very weak; aching still continued, but less; cords of neck,\r\nright side, quite painful. Passed a restless night, still sweating\r\nprofusely.\r\n\r\n\"July 20th.--Much better, but still very weak; some aching and sweating;\r\ndid not go to sleep until 3 A.M.; was nervous and restless.\r\n\r\n\"July 21st.--Much improved in every way, and was all right in a day or\r\ntwo. Did not take any more of the remedy.\r\n\r\n\"July 26th.--At 1:30 P.M. commenced to feel chilly, with intense\r\nheadache and aching all over the body. The chilliness rapidly increased\r\nuntil at 2 o'clock had a worse chill than ever, which lasted until 4\r\no'clock, when fever came on, temperature soon reaching 103 deg.; sweating\r\ncommenced almost simultaneously with the fever; headache was the most\r\nprominent symptom, which was terrific; intense, congestive headache;\r\neyes extremely sensitive; bones of the face sensitive to touch; could\r\nnot move the head a hair's breadth without intense agony; thought I\r\nshould go mad from the intensity of the pain. This lasted until 10:30,\r\nwhen there was a sensation of faintness, due evidently to lack of food,\r\nand which passed away after eating some cream toast; the headache then\r\nalso began to grow less, and I passed a fairly good night.\r\n\r\n\"July 27th.--Was much better, but was too nervous to remain in bed; felt\r\nvery weak all day; retired early, but did not sleep a moment all night\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\"July 28th.--Arose at 6 A.M.; was weak and dizzy all day; had to lie\r\ndown every little while.
