This\r\ndiscovery is easily made in the present instance.\r\n\r\nI wish to state that the range of this book, as its title implies, is\r\nmainly restricted to the salient points of the historical sketch it\r\nattempts to pourtray. To have written a complete History of the Insane\r\nin the British Isles would have necessitated the narration of details\r\nuninteresting to the general reader. Hence, as the periods and the\r\ninstitutions of greatest importance have alone been brought into\r\nprominence, others have been inevitably thrown into the shade. Thus\r\nBethlem Hospital has occupied much space as the centre around which\r\ngathers a large amount of historic interest, having been with our\r\nforefathers almost the only representative for many centuries of the\r\nattempt to provide for the insane in England--the outward symbol of\r\nnearly all they knew on the subject. To the Retreat at York, again,\r\nconsiderable attention has been devoted in this history, as the cradle\r\nof reform which made the year 1792 the date of the new departure in the\r\ntreatment of the unhappy class, on whose behalf the various charitable\r\nand national acts recorded in this volume have been performed.\r\n\r\nLincoln and Hanwell also, which in the course of time were the scenes of\r\nredoubled efforts to ameliorate the condition of the insane, have\r\nreceived in these pages a large, but certainly not too large, measure of\r\npraise; and the writer would have been glad could he have conveniently\r\nfound space for a fuller description of the good work done at the latter\r\nestablishment.[1]\r\n\r\nOf no other malady would the history of the victims demand so constant a\r\nreference to legislation. In the chapter devoted to it, the Earl of\r\nShaftesbury has formed the central figure, honourably distinguished, as\r\nhave been several other members of the legislature in the same cause,\r\nboth before and after the year 1828, when as Lord Ashley he seconded Mr.\r\nGordon's Bill, and first came publicly forward in support of measures\r\ndesigned to advance the interests of the insane. A laborious and\r\nsometimes fruitless examination of _Hansard_, from the earliest period\r\nof lunacy legislation, has been necessary in order to present a\r\ncontinuous narrative of the successive steps by which so great a success\r\nhas been achieved.\r\n\r\nNo one knows so well as the historian of an important and extended\r\nmovement like this, the deficiencies by which its recital is marred, but\r\nI trust that I have at least succeeded in supplying a want which some\r\nhave long felt, in placing before the British reader the main outlines\r\nof a history with which every friend of humanity ought to be acquainted.\r\nIts interest, I need hardly urge, extends far beyond the pale of the\r\nmedical profession, and no one who has reason to desire for friend or\r\nrelative the kindly care or the skilful treatment required for a\r\ndisordered mind, can do otherwise than wish gratefully to recognize\r\nthose who, during well-nigh a century, have laboured to make this care\r\nand this treatment what they are at the present day.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it remains for me to express my obligations to those who\r\nhave in various ways rendered me assistance in the prosecution of this\r\nwork. In addition to acknowledgments made in the following pages, I have\r\npleasure in thanking Dr. McDowall, of Morpeth, for the use of manuscript\r\nnotes of works bearing on the first chapter; as also Mr. S. Langley. I\r\nhave to thank Mr. Coote, of the Map Department at the British Museum,\r\nand Mr. F. Ross, for help in preparing the chapter on Bethlem Hospital;\r\nalso Dr. W. A. F. Browne of Dumfries, and Dr. Clouston of the Edinburgh\r\nRoyal Asylum, for valuable information utilized in the chapter on the\r\nhistory of the insane in Scotland. Lastly, in the preparation of this,\r\nas of other works, I am greatly indebted to the ever-willingly rendered\r\nassistance of Mr. R. Garnett, of the British Museum Reading Room.\r\n\r\n  4, CHARLOTTE STREET,\r\n      BEDFORD SQUARE,\r\n          _June 12, 1882_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The reader is referred to Dr. Conolly's \"The Treatment of the Insane\r\nwithout Mechanical Restraints\" (1856) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                 PAGE\r\n\r\n     I.

Demoniacal\r\npossession was fully believed to be the frequent cause of insanity, and,\r\nas is well known, exorcism was practised by the Church as a recognized\r\nordinance. We meet with some interesting particulars in regard to\r\ntreatment, in what may be called its medico-ecclesiastical aspect, in a\r\nwork of the early part of the tenth century, by an unknown author,\r\nentitled \"Leechdoms, Wortcunning, and Starcraft of Early England,\" or,\r\nas we should say, \"Medicine, Herb Treatment, and Astrology.\" It forms a\r\ncollection of documents never before published, illustrating the history\r\nof science in this country before the Norman Conquest.[2] It clearly\r\nappears that the Saxon leeches derived much of their knowledge directly\r\nfrom the Romans, and through them from the Greeks, but they also\r\npossessed a good deal of their own. The herbs they employed bespeak\r\nconsiderable acquaintance with botany and its application to medicine as\r\nunderstood at that day. The classic peony was administered as a remedy\r\nfor insanity, and mugwort was regarded as useful in putting to flight\r\nwhat this Saxon book calls \"devil sickness,\" that is, a mental malady\r\narising from a demon. Here is a recipe for \"a fiend-sick man\" when a\r\ndemon possesses or dominates him from within. \"Take a spew-drink, namely\r\nlupin, bishopwort, henbane, cropleek. Pound them together; add ale for a\r\nliquid, let it stand for a night, and add fifty libcorns[3] or cathartic\r\ngrains and holy water.\"[4] Here, at any rate, we have a remedy still\r\nemployed, although rejected from the English Pharmacopoeias of 1746 and\r\n1788--henbane or hyoscyamus--to say nothing of ale. Another mixture,\r\ncompounded of many herbs and of clear ale, was to be drunk out of a\r\nchurch-bell,[5] while seven masses were to be sung over the worts or\r\nherbs, and the lunatic was to sing psalms, the priest saying over him\r\nthe _Domine, sancte pater omnipotens_.\r\n\r\nDioscorides and Apuleius are often the sources of the prescriptions of\r\nthe Saxons, at least as regards the herb employed. For a lunatic it is\r\nordered to \"take clove wort and wreathe it with a red thread about the\r\nman's swere (neck) when the moon is on the wane, in the month which is\r\ncalled April, in the early part of October; soon he will be healed.\"\r\nAgain, \"for a lunatic, take the juice of teucrium polium which we named\r\npolion, mix with vinegar, smear therewith them that suffer that evil\r\nbefore it will to him (_before the access_), and shouldest thou put the\r\nleaves of it and the roots of it on a clean cloth, and bind about the\r\nman's swere who suffers the evil, it will give an experimental proof of\r\nthat same thing (_its virtue_).\"[6]\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be regretted that the virtues ascribed to peony, used\r\nnot internally, but in the following way, are not confirmed by\r\nexperience. \"For lunacy, if a man layeth this wort peony over the\r\nlunatic, as he lies, soon he upheaveth himself hole; and if he have this\r\nwort with him, the disease never again approaches him.\"[7]\r\n\r\nMandrake, as much as three pennies in weight, administered in a draught\r\nof warm water, was prescribed for witlessness; and periwinkle (_Vinca\r\npervinca_) was regarded as of great advantage for demoniacal possession,\r\nand \"various wishes, and envy, and terror, and that thou may have grace,\r\nand if thou hast this wort with thee thou shalt be prosperous and ever\r\nacceptable.\"\r\n\r\nThen follows an amusing direction: \"This wort shalt thou pluck thus,\r\nsaying, 'I pray thee, _Vinca pervinca_, thee that art to be had for thy\r\nmany useful qualities, that thou come to me glad, blossoming with thy\r\nmainfulnesses; that thou outfit me so, that I be shielded and ever\r\nprosperous, and undamaged by poisons and by wrath;' when thou shalt\r\npluck this wort, thou shalt be clean from every uncleanness, and thou\r\nshalt pick it when the moon is nine nights old, and eleven nights, and\r\nthirteen nights and thirty nights, and when it is one night old.\"[8]\r\n\r\nFor epilepsy in a child a curious charm is given in this book, used also\r\nfor \"a dream of an apparition.\" The brain of a mountain goat was to be\r\ndrawn through a golden ring, and then \"given to the child to swallow\r\nbefore it tastes milk; it will be healed.\"[9]\r\n\r\nWolf's flesh, well-dressed and sodden, was to be eaten by a man troubled\r\nwith hallucinations. \"The apparitions which ere appeared to him, shall\r\nnot disquiet him.\"[10]\r\n\r\nTemptations of the fiend were warded off by \"a wort hight red\r\nniolin--red stalk--which waxeth by running water. If thou hast it on\r\nthee and under thy head bolster, and over thy house doors, the devil may\r\nnot scathe thee, within nor without\" (lviii.).\r\n\r\nAgain, we have a cure for mental vacancy and folly: \"Put into ale\r\nbishopwort, lupins, betony, the southern (or Italian) fennel, nepte\r\n(catmint), water agrimony, cockle, marche; then let the man drink. For\r\nidiocy and folly: Put into ale cassia, and lupins, bishopwort,\r\nalexander, githrife, fieldmore, and holy water; then let him drink.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough hardly coming under my theme, I cannot omit this: \"Against a\r\nwoman's chatter: Taste at night fasting a root of radish, that day the\r\nchatter cannot harm thee.\"\r\n\r\nFor the temptations of the fiend and for night (goblin) visitors, for\r\nfascination, and for evil enchantments by song, they prescribed as\r\nfollows:--\"Seek in the maw of young swallows for some little stones, and\r\nmind that they touch neither earth nor water nor other stones; look out\r\nthree of them; put them on the man on whom thou wilt, him who hath the\r\nneed, he will soon be well.\"\r\n\r\nThe ceremonial enjoined in making use of a salve against the elfin race\r\nand nocturnal goblin visitors (nightmare) is extremely curious. \"Take\r\nthe ewe hop plant (probably female hop), wormwood, bishopwort, lupin,\r\netc.; put these worts into a vessel, set them under the altar, sing over\r\nthem nine masses, boil them in butter and sheep's grease, add much holy\r\nsalt, strain through a cloth, throw the worts into running water. If any\r\nill tempting occur to a man, or an elf or goblin night-visitors come,\r\nsmear his forehead with this salve, and put it on his eyes, and where\r\nhis body is sore, and cense him with incense, and sign him frequently\r\nwith the sign of the cross; his condition will soon be better\"\r\n(lxi.).[11]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that in these prescriptions a distinction was made\r\nbetween persons who were regarded as possessed and those supposed to be\r\nlunatics. For the latter, however, the ecclesiastical element came in as\r\nwell as the medical one. Herbs were prescribed which were to be mixed\r\nwith foreign ale and holy water, while masses were sung over the patient\r\n\"Let him drink this drink,\" say they, \"for nine mornings, at every one\r\nfresh, and no other liquid that is thick and still; and let him give\r\nalms and earnestly pray God for his mercies.\" The union of ale and holy\r\nwater forms an amusing, though unintentioned, satire on the jovial monk\r\nof the Middle Ages. I may remark that the old Saxon term \"_wood_\" is\r\napplied in these recipes to the frenzied. It survives in the Scotch\r\n\"wud,\" _i.e._ mad.[12] Thus for the \"wood-heart\" it is ordered that\r\n\"when day and night divide, then sing thou in the Church, litanies, that\r\nis, the names of the hallows (or saints) and the Paternoster.\" This was,\r\nas usual, accompanied by the taking of certain herbs and drink. In some\r\ninstances, a salve was to be smeared on the temples and above the eyes.\r\nMedicated baths were not omitted in their prescriptions. Thus for a\r\n\"wit-sick man,\" as they call him, they say, \"Put a pail full of cold\r\nwater, drop thrice into it some of the drink, bathe the man in the\r\nwater, and let him eat hallowed bread and cheese and garlic and\r\ncropleek, and drink a cup full of the drink; and when he hath been\r\nbathed, smear with the salve thoroughly, and when it is better with him,\r\nthen work him a strong purgative drink,\" which is duly particularized.\r\nIt is unnecessary to give more of these quaint prescriptions, one of\r\nwhich is a drink \"against a devil and dementedness\" (an illustration, by\r\nthe way, how the one idea ran into the other); those which I have given\r\nwill suffice to show the kind of pharmacopoeia in use, with the Saxon\r\nmonk-doctor, for madness. But did their treatment consist of nothing\r\nmore potent or severe than herbs and salves and baths? It would have\r\nbeen surprising indeed had it not. And so we find the following\r\ndecidedly stringent application prescribed:--\"In case a man be lunatic,\r\ntake a skin of mere-swine (that is, a sea-pig or porpoise), work it into\r\na whip, and swinge the man therewith; soon he will be well. Amen.\"[13]\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of this interesting book I think that the impression\r\nleft on the mind of the reader in regard to the circumstances under\r\nwhich it was written, will be clearer, if I cite the following\r\ndescription by the editor:--\"Here,\" he says, \"a leech calmly sits down\r\nto compose a not unlearned book, treating of many serious diseases,\r\nassigning for them something he hopes will cure them.... The author\r\nalmost always rejects the Greek recipes, and doctors as an herborist....\r\nBald was the owner of the book, Cild the scribe. The former may be\r\nfairly presumed to have been a medical practitioner, for to no other\r\ncould such a book as this have had, at that time, much interest. We see,\r\nthen, a Saxon leech at his studies; the book, in a literary sense, is\r\nlearned; in a professional view not so, for it does not really advance\r\nman's knowledge of disease or of cures. It may have seemed by the solemn\r\nelaboration of its diagnoses to do so, but I dare not assert there is\r\nreal substance in it.... If Bald was at once a physician and a reader of\r\nlearned books on therapeutics, his example implies a school of medicine\r\namong the Saxons. And the volume itself bears out the presumption. We\r\nread in two cases that 'Oxa taught this leechdom;' in another, that\r\n'Dun taught it;' in another, 'some teach us;' in another, an impossible\r\nprescription being quoted, the author, or possibly Cild, the reedsman,\r\nindulges in a little facetious comment, that compliance was not\r\neasy.\"[14]\r\n\r\nSome light is thrown on the treatment of the insane in early English\r\ndays by a study of the \"Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and\r\nIreland during the Middle Ages,\" published under the direction of the\r\nMaster of the Rolls. The inference to be drawn, however, is only that\r\nwhich we might have drawn already from what I have stated. It is\r\nobserved by Mr. Brewer, the editor of one of these works, written by\r\nGiraldus of Wales, who was born 1147, \"For the sick, if medicine was\r\nrequired, there was none to be had except in the monastery; and in this\r\ncountry, at all events, the monks were the only medical\r\npractitioners.\"[15] That at that time chains were employed for the\r\ninsane is incidentally shown by the following story. Walter Mapes,\r\nchaplain to Henry II., when living in Gloucestershire, in the Forest of\r\nDean, fell ill. The abbot of a Cistercian house visited him, and used\r\nhis utmost efforts to induce him to become a monk of their order. Mapes,\r\nwho was well known to be inimical to Religious Orders, thereupon called\r\nhis clerks and attendants (he was a canon and archdeacon), and said, \"If\r\never in my sickness, or on any other occasion, I ask for this habit, be\r\ncertain that it arises not from the exercise of my reason, but the\r\nviolence of my disease, as sick men often desire what is foolish or\r\nprejudicial. But should it ever so happen that I resolutely insist on\r\nbecoming a monk then bind me with chains and fetters as a lunatic who\r\nhas lost his wits, and keep me in close custody until I repent and\r\nrecover my senses.\" (\"Tanquam furibundum et mente captum catenis et\r\nvinculis me statim fortiter astringatis, et arcta custodia,\" etc.[16])\r\n\r\nThat at this period the influence of the moon in producing lunacy was\r\nrecognized (as, indeed, when and where was it not?) is proved by\r\nobservations of the above writer, Giraldus of Wales, in his\r\n\"Topographica Hibernica,\" vol. v. p. 79. \"Those,\" he observes, \"are\r\ncalled lunatics whose attacks are exacerbated every month when the moon\r\nis full.\" He combats the interpretation of an expositor of Saint\r\nMatthew, who said that the insane are spoken of by him as lunatics, not\r\nbecause their madness comes by the moon, but because the devil, who\r\ncauses insanity, avails himself of the phases of the moon (_lunaria\r\ntempora_). Giraldus, on the contrary, observes that the expositor might\r\nhave said not less truly that the malady was in consequence of the\r\nhumours being enormously increased in some persons when the moon is\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nThe name of Giraldus is associated with a celebrated holy well in\r\nFlintshire, that of St. Winifred, said to be the most famous in the\r\nBritish Isles. At her shrine he offered his devotions in the twelfth\r\ncentury, when he says, \"She seemed still to retain her miraculous\r\npowers.\" The cure of lunacy at this well is not particularized, but it\r\nis highly probable from the practice resorted to, as we shall see, at\r\nothers in Britain.[17]\r\n\r\nI may here say that there is not much to be found in Chaucer (1328-1400)\r\nbearing in any way upon the insane, though he occasionally uses the word\r\n\"wodeness\" for madness, and \"wood\" or \"wod\" for the furiously\r\ninsane.[18] So again in an old English miscellany of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, translated from the Latin, we read--\r\n\r\n    \"Ofte we brennen in mod\r\n     And werden so weren wod;\"\r\n\r\nthat is to say, \"Oft do we burn in rage and become as it were mad.\"\r\n\r\nI have, in examining that curious book, the \"Vision of William\r\nconcerning Piers the Plowman,\" written in 1393 by William Langland,[19]\r\nfound one or two passages having reference to my subject which are worth\r\nciting. The author, after saying that beggars whose churches are\r\nbrew-houses may be left to starve, adds that there are some, however,\r\nwho are idiotic or lunatic. He also says that men give gifts to\r\nminstrels, and so should the rich help God's minstrels, namely,\r\nlunatics. This is one of the rare instances in which the insane are\r\nspoken of in kindly terms by the old writers, although it would be quite\r\nunfair to regard what was doubtless harsh treatment as intentionally\r\ncruel. Piers the Plowman speaks of men and women wanting in wit, whom he\r\nstyles \"lunatik lollares,\" that is, persons who loll about, who care for\r\nneither cold nor heat, and are \"meuynge after the mone.\" He says that--\r\n\r\n                                \"Moneyless they walke\r\n    With a good wil, witless, meny wyde contreys\r\n    Ryght as Peter dade and Paul, save that they preche nat.\"\r\n\r\nIn many instances mistaken kindness, in others ignorance and\r\nsuperstition, guided the past treatment of the insane. When residing in\r\nCornwall some years ago, I was interested in the traditions of that once\r\nisolated county, and heard of a practice long since discontinued, which\r\nillustrates this observation. It was called \"bowssening\" (or ducking)\r\nthe lunatic, from a Cornu-British or Armoric word, _beuzi_ or _bidhyzi_\r\nmeaning to baptize, dip, or drown.[20] There were, it seems, many places\r\nwhere this custom was observed in Cornwall, but the one I now refer to\r\nwas at Altarnun, and was called St. Nun's Pool. It is situated about\r\neight miles from Launceston. Though the name of this saint gives the\r\nimpression of her being a nun, it appears that she was a beautiful girl,\r\nwith whom Cereticus, a Welsh prince, fell in love. According to\r\ntradition, she was buried at Altarnun. The church was afterwards\r\ndedicated to St. Mary. The water from the pool was allowed to flow into\r\nan enclosed space, and on the surrounding wall the patient was made to\r\nstand with his back to the water, and was then by a sudden blow thrown\r\nbackwards into it. Then (to quote a graphic description which has been\r\ngiven of it), \"a strong fellowe, provided for the nonce, tooke him and\r\ntossed him up and downe alongst and athwart the water, untill the\r\npatient by forgoing his strength had somewhat forgot his fury. Then was\r\nhe conveyed to the church, and certain masses sung over him, upon which\r\nhandling, if his right wits returned, St. Nunne had the thanks; but if\r\nthere appeared small amendment, he was bowssened againe and againe while\r\nthere remayned in him any hope of life, for recovery.\" Men who had\r\nactually witnessed this treatment of lunacy related this narrative to\r\nCarew, the author of the \"Survey of Cornwall,\" published in 1769, and he\r\ngives an explanation of the custom which is no doubt erroneous, but is\r\ncurious for other reasons. \"It may be,\" he says, \"this device took\r\noriginal from the Master of Bedlam, who (the fable sayeth) used to cure\r\nhis patients of that impatience by keeping them bound in pools up to the\r\nmiddle, and so more or less after the fit of their fury\" (p. 123). The\r\npresent Master goes further, and keeps them up to the neck in a\r\nprolonged warm bath!\r\n\r\nThe Vicar of Altarnun, Rev. John Power, in response to my inquiries, has\r\nbeen good enough to ask the oldest men in the parish whether they\r\nremembered the well being so used, but they do not. At the corner of a\r\nmeadow there is still an intermittent spring, flowing freely in wet\r\nweather. The tank which was formerly on the spot has gone, the farmers\r\nhaving removed the stone in order to mend the fences, and consequently\r\nmuch of the water has been diverted into other channels, emptying\r\nitself into the river St. Inny, which runs a few hundred yards in the\r\nvalley below. It seems probable that the working of a large stone quarry\r\nin the hills above has cut off the main current of the spring.\r\n\r\nTo Carew's account Dr. Borlase adds that in his opinion \"a similar\r\nbowssening pit has existed at a well in St. Agnes' parish.\" Among other\r\nCornish wells which had healing virtues assigned them was St. Levan's,\r\nand the insane, no doubt, partook of them. \"Over the spring,\" says Dr.\r\nBoase, \"lies a large flat stone, wide enough to serve as a foundation\r\nfor a little square chapel erected upon it; the chapel is no more than\r\nfive feet square, seven feet high, the little roof of it of stone. The\r\nwater is reckoned very good for eyes, toothache, and the like, and when\r\npeople have washed, they are always advised to go into this chapel and\r\nsleep upon the stone, which is the floor of it, for it must be\r\nremembered that whilst you are sleeping upon these consecrated stones,\r\nthe saint is sure to dispense his healing influence.\" Madron Well\r\nattained a great celebrity for healing diseases and for divining. \"Girls\r\ndropped crooked pins in to raise bubbles and divine the period of their\r\nmarriage.\"[21]\r\n\r\nMr. W. C. Borlase, M.P., informs me that at St. Kea, near Truro, within\r\nthe walls of the church, was a stone to which, within the memory of an\r\nold gentleman who died only about two years ago, an inhabitant of the\r\nparish, on becoming insane, was chained. He adds that just as Altarnun\r\nis Nun's altar, the parish of Elerky is derived from St. Kea's altar\r\n(Eller or Aller-ke).\r\n\r\nScotland was still more remarkable than Cornwall for its lunacy-healing\r\nwells and extraordinary superstitions, surviving also to a much later\r\nperiod; in fact, not yet dispelled by civilization and science. Every\r\none has heard of St. Fillan's Well (strictly, a pool) in Perthshire, and\r\nknows the lines in \"Marmion\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Then to Saint Fillan's blessed well,\r\n     Whose spring can frenzied dreams dispel,\r\n     And the crazed brain restore.\"\r\n\r\nThis well, derived from the river of that name in the vale of\r\nStrathfillan, and consecrated by the saint who, according to tradition,\r\nconverted the inhabitants to Christianity,[22] has been ever since\r\ndistinguished by his name, and esteemed of sovereign virtue in curing\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\nThere was an abbot living in the Vale of St. Fillan in 1703. \"He is\r\npleased,\" says Pennant, in his \"Tour in Scotland\" (vol. ii. p. 15), \"to\r\ntake under his protection the disordered in mind; and works wonderful\r\ncures, say his votaries, unto this day.\" It was, he says, a second\r\nBethesda. He wrote in 1774.\r\n\r\nMr. Heron, the author of a \"Journey through Part of Scotland,\" made in\r\nthe year 1793, observes that in his day \"about two hundred persons\r\nafflicted in this way are annually brought to try the benefits of its\r\nsalutary influence. These patients,\" he continues, \"are conducted by\r\ntheir friends, who first perform the ceremony of passing with them\r\nthrice round a neighbouring cairn; on this cairn they then deposit a\r\nsimple offering of clothes, or perhaps of a small bunch of heath.... The\r\npatient is then thrice immerged in the sacred pool; after the immersion\r\nhe is bound hand and foot, and left for the night in a chapel which\r\nstands near. If the maniac is found loose in the morning, good hopes are\r\nconceived of his full recovery. If he is still bound, his cure remains\r\ndoubtful. It sometimes happens that death relieves him during his\r\nconfinement from the troubles of life.\"[23]\r\n\r\nAn Englishman who visited the spot five years afterwards (1798) says the\r\npatient was fastened down in the open churchyard on a stone all the\r\nnight, with a covering of hay over him, and St. Fillan's bell put over\r\nhis head. The people believed that wherever the bell was removed to, it\r\nalways returned to a particular place in the churchyard next morning.\r\n\"In order to ascertain the truth of this ridiculous story, I carried it\r\noff with me,\" continues this English traveller. \"An old woman, who\r\nobserved what I was about, asked me what I wanted with the bell, and I\r\ntold her that I had an unfortunate relation at home out of his mind, and\r\nthat I wanted to have him cured. 'Oh, but,' says she, 'you must bring\r\nhim here to be cured, or it will be of no use.' Upon which I told her\r\nhe was too ill to be moved, and off I galloped with the bell.\" To make\r\nthis story complete, I should add that the son of this gentleman,\r\nresiding in Hertfordshire, restored to Scotland this interesting relic,\r\nafter the lapse of seventy-one years, namely, in 1869.\r\n\r\nAt Struthill, in Stirlingshire, was a well famous for its healing\r\nvirtues in madness. \"Several persons,\" says Dalyell, \"testified to the\r\nPresbytery of Stirling in 1668, that, having carried a woman thither,\r\nthey had stayed two nights at an house hard by the well; that the first\r\nnight they did bind her twice to a stone at the well, but she came into\r\nthe house to them, being loosed without any help; the second night they\r\nbound her over again to the same stone, and she returned loosed; and\r\nthey declare also, that she was very mad before they took her to the\r\nwell, but since that time she is working and sober in her wits.\" He adds\r\nthat this well was still celebrated in 1723, and votive offerings were\r\nleft; but no one then surviving knew that the virtues of the stone were\r\nin request. The chapel itself was demolished in 1650, in order to\r\nsuppress the superstitions connected with this well.[24]\r\n\r\nThe virtues of St. Ronan's Well were renowned of old, and are still\r\ncredited. The lunatic walks round the Temple of St. Molonah, whose ruin\r\nnear the Butt of Lewis remains. He is sprinkled with water from the\r\nwell, is bound, and placed on the site of the altar for the night. A\r\ncure is expected, if he sleep; if not, the fates are considered adverse,\r\nand he returns home. My authority, Dr. Mitchell, records a case of\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nThere is in Ross-shire a small Island on Loch Maree, called Inch or\r\nInnis Maree, where is a famous well, bearing the name of this saint,[25]\r\nwho lived at the beginning of the eighth century. This well was\r\ncelebrated for its virtues in the cure of mental disorders. Pennant, the\r\nauthor already quoted, visited it in 1769, and gave a graphic\r\ndescription of the superstitious practices connected with its supposed\r\nsanctity. \"The curiosity of the place,\" he writes, \"is the well of the\r\nsaint, of power unspeakable in cases of lunacy. The patient is brought\r\ninto the sacred island, is made to kneel before the altar where his\r\nattendants leave an offering in money; he is then brought to the well\r\nand sips some of the holy water; a second offering is made; that done,\r\nhe is thrice dipped in the lake, and the same operation is repeated\r\nevery day for some weeks; and it often happens, by natural causes, the\r\npatient receives relief, of which the saint receives the credit. I must\r\nadd that the visitants draw from the state of the well an omen of the\r\ndisposition of St. Maree; if his well is full they suppose he will be\r\npropitious; if not, they proceed in their operations with fears and\r\ndoubts, but let the event be what it will, he is held in high\r\nesteem.\"[26]\r\n\r\nThis practice was, no doubt, closely connected with the belief of the\r\ninhabitants that the insane were possessed. \"To preclude the demon from\r\nlurking in the hair, a special water was sometimes used; the patient was\r\nplunged over head and ears in a bath of Gregorian water,[27] and\r\ndetained there just up to the drowning point.\"[28] Dr. Mitchell\r\n(Commissioner in Lunacy in Scotland) has given a most interesting\r\naccount of similar Scotch customs associated with their treatment of\r\ntheir insane, practised from time immemorial, and therefore illustrating\r\nthe proceedings of a remote antiquity, pagan as well as Christian. But I\r\nmust content myself with a very brief reference to his descriptions.\r\nWriting of the island of Maree in 1862, he states that about seven years\r\nbefore a furious madman was brought there; \"a rope was passed round his\r\nwaist, and with a couple of men at one end in advance, and a couple at\r\nthe other behind, like a furious bull to the slaughter-house, he was\r\nmarched to the Loch side and placed in a boat, which was pulled once\r\nround the island, the patient being jerked into the water at intervals.\r\nHe was then landed, drank of the water, attached his offering to the\r\ntree, and, as I was told, in a state of happy tranquillity went\r\nhome.\"[29]\r\n\r\nWhittier has expressed in verse the virtues of the well of St. Maree, as\r\nScott those of St. Fillan:--\r\n\r\n    \"And whoso bathes therein his brow,\r\n       With care or madness burning,\r\n     Feels once again his healthful thought\r\n       And sense of peace returning.\r\n\r\n    \"O restless heart and fevered brain,\r\n       Unquiet and unstable,\r\n     That holy well of Loch Maree\r\n       Is more than idle fable.\"\r\n\r\nOf another place, the island of Melista, in the Hebrides, it is stated\r\nthat, according to tradition, no one was ever born there who was not\r\nfrom birth insane, or who did not become so before death. \"In the last\r\ngeneration, three persons had the misfortune for the first time to see\r\nthe light of day on this unlucky spot, and all three were mad. Of one of\r\nthem, who is remembered by the name of Wild Murdoch, many strange\r\nstories are told. It is said that his friends used to tie a rope round\r\nhis body, make it fast to the stern of the boat, and then pull out to\r\nsea, taking the wretched man in tow. The story goes that he was so\r\nbuoyant he could not sink; that they 'tried to press him down into the\r\nwater;' that he could swim with a stone fastened to him; that when\r\ncarried to the rocky holms of Melista or Greinan, round which the open\r\nAtlantic surges, and left there alone, he took to the water and ran\r\nashore; and that when bound hand and foot, and left in a kiln, by a\r\nmiracle of strength he broke his bonds and escaped. It is thus they are\r\nsaid to have treated him during his fits of maniacal excitement; and\r\nthere are many still alive who saw it all, and gave a helping hand....\r\nThe further story of Wild Murdoch will astonish no one. He murdered his\r\nsister, was taken south, and died in an asylum, or, as the people say\r\nand believe, in the cell of a gloomy prison, under which the sea-wave\r\ncame and went for ever.\"[30]\r\n\r\nCurious ancient superstitions besides those connected with wells still\r\nsurvive in the \"land o' cakes.\" The same observant writer says that in\r\nthe north of Scotland they literally sacrifice a cock to a nameless but\r\nsecretly acknowledged power, whose propitiation is sought in the cure of\r\nepilepsy. On the spot where the patient falls a black cock is buried\r\nalive, along with a lock of the patient's hair, and some parings of his\r\nnails. Let it not be supposed that this was done in some outlandish part\r\nof the world. Dr. Mitchell assures us that this sacrifice was openly\r\noffered recently in an improving town to which the railway now conveys\r\nthe traveller, and which has six churches and ten schools for a\r\npopulation of about four thousand. If such things are done in the green\r\ntree, what must have been done in the dry? We may safely read the past\r\nin the present. In fact, Dalyell[31] states that in 1597 the \"earding of\r\nane quik cok in the grund\" was regarded as a cure of madness.\r\n\r\nHe also records the fact that a Scotch empiric of the seventeenth\r\ncentury professed the cure of those \"'visseit with frenacies, madness,\r\nfalling evil (epilepsy), persones distractit in their wittis, and with\r\nfeirful apparitiones, etc., and utheris uncouth diseases; all done be\r\nsorcerie, incantation, devellische charmeing.' Above forty persons are\r\nenumerated for whom he had prescribed, for which he was strangled and\r\nburnt as too familiar with Satan.\"[32] The same author relates that a\r\npoor woman having become frantic, the alleged author of the malady came,\r\nand \"laying hands on hir, she convaleschit and receivit hir sinsis\r\nagane.\"[33] This was in 1616.\r\n\r\nInsane persons were sometimes treated with holy water, to which _salt_\r\nwas added, with the idea that the devil abhorred salt as the emblem of\r\nimmortality (we have already had to notice this use of salt among the\r\nSaxons). Hence it was \"consecrated by the papists, as profiting the\r\nhealth of the body, and for the banishment of demons.\" A certain\r\nremedial \"watter,\" used in Scotland by wise women or herbalists, is\r\nsupposed to have contained the same ingredient. Elspeth Sandisone, in\r\n1629, was bereft of her senses. One Richart was thus accused of having\r\ntried to cure her. \"Ye call the remedie 'watter forspeking,' and took\r\nwatter into ane round cape and went out into the byre, and took sumthing\r\nout of your purse lyk unto great salt, and did cast thairin, and did\r\nspit thrie severall times in the samen; and ye confest yourself when ye\r\nhad done so, ye _aunchit in bitts_, quhilk is ane Norne terme, quhilk is\r\nto say ye blew your braith thairin and thairefter ye sent it to the said\r\nElspeth with the servand woman of the hous, and bad that the said\r\nElspeth sould be waschit thairin, hands and feit, and scho sould be als\r\nholl as ever scho was.\"[34]\r\n\r\nI may give here a curious illustration of insanity being induced, not\r\ncured, by superstition in Scotland. John Law's servant \"rane wode\" when\r\nJohn Knox had retreated to St. Andrews during the civil contentions of\r\nhis later years. The story is thus quaintly told in Bannatyne's\r\n\"Journal\" (p. 309). John Law of that city, being in Edinburgh Castle in\r\nJanuary, 1572, \"the ladie Home wald neidis thraip in his face that he\r\nwas banist the said toune because that, in the yarde reasit (rose) sum\r\nsanctis, among whome cam up the devill with hornis, which when his\r\nservant Ritchart saw, rane wode, and so deit.\"[35]\r\n\r\nBut I must not dwell longer on the treatment of lunatics by the\r\nHighlanders, or the superstitions of Scotland in this connection, and\r\nwill now say a few words in reference to Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to narrate the stories which in Ireland connect popular\r\nsuperstition with the treatment of the insane, but I will only refer to\r\none. The reader may have heard of the \"Valley of the Lunatics,\" or\r\nGlen-na-galt, in that country. It is situated in Kerry, near Tralee. It\r\nwas believed, not only in that county, but in Ireland generally, that\r\nall lunatics would ultimately, if left to themselves, find their way to\r\nthis glen to be cured.[36] In the valley are two wells, called the\r\n\"Lunatic's Wells,\" or Tober-na-galt, to which the lunatics resort,\r\ncrossing a stream flowing through the glen, at a point called the\r\n\"Madman's Ford,\" or Ahagaltaun, and passing by the \"Standing Stone of\r\nthe Lunatics\" (Cloghnagalt). Of these waters they drink, and eat the\r\ncresses growing on the margin; the firm belief being that the healing\r\nwater, and the cresses, and the mysterious virtue of the glen will\r\neffectually restore the madman to mental health.\r\n\r\nDr. Oscar Woods, the medical superintendent of the District Lunatic\r\nAsylum, Kilkenny, informs me that the superstition has nearly died out\r\nsince this asylum was opened, about thirty years ago. Dr. Woods gives a\r\ndifferent etymology, namely, _bright_, for _galt_; the valley in that\r\ncase deriving its name in contradistinction to that on the other side of\r\nthe hill, Emaloghue, on which the sun scarcely ever shines. He thinks\r\nthe superstition arose from persons labouring under melancholy going\r\nfrom the sunless to the bright valley. \"Why this place,\" wrote Dr. C.\r\nSmith in 1756,[37] \"rather than any other should be frequented by\r\nlunatics, nobody can pretend to ascertain any rational cause, and yet no\r\none truth is more firmly credited here by the common people than this\r\nimpertinent fable.\" He, however, says that having regard to the awful\r\nappearance of these desolate glens and mountains, none but madmen would\r\nenter them! Recurring to the meaning of the word _galt_, a gentleman in\r\nIreland, a professor of Irish, states that _geilt_ is a mad person, one\r\nliving in the woods, and that _gealt_ is the genitive plural. It is\r\ninteresting to find, also, from the same source, that the Irish word for\r\nthe moon is _gealach_, indicating a probable etymological connection.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of this superstition, it appears to be of very ancient\r\ndate. It is stated[38] that the Fenian tale, called \"Cath Finntraglia,\"\r\nor \"The Battle of Ventry,\" relates how Daire Dornmhar, \"the monarch of\r\nthe world,\" landed at Ventry to conquer Erin, and was opposed in mortal\r\ncombat by Finnmac-Cumhail and his men. The battles were many and lasted\r\na year and a day, and at last the \"monarch of the world\" was completely\r\nrepulsed, and driven from the shores of Ireland. In the battle, Gall,\r\nthe son of the King of Ulster, only a youth, who had come to the help of\r\nFinnmac-Cumhail, \"having entered the battle with extreme eagerness, his\r\nexcitement soon increased to absolute frenzy, and, after having\r\nperformed astounding deeds of valour, fled in a state of derangement\r\nfrom the scene of slaughter, and never stopped till he plunged into the\r\nwild seclusion of this valley.\" The opinion is that this Gall was the\r\nfirst lunatic who went there, and that with him this singular local\r\nsuperstition originated, followed as it has been by innumerable\r\npilgrimages to the beautiful \"Valley of Lunatics\" and its wells.\r\n\r\nA visitor to this valley in 1845 writes: \"We went to see Glenagalt, or\r\nthe 'Madman's Glen,' the place, as our guide sagely assured us, 'to\r\nwhich all the mad people in the world would face, if they could get\r\nloose.' After pursuing for miles our romantic route, we came to the\r\nhighest part of the road, and turned a hill which completely shut out\r\nGlen Inch; and lo! before us lay a lovely valley, sweeping down through\r\nnoble hills to Brandon Bay. The peak of the mighty Brandon himself ended\r\none ridge of the boundary, while high, though less majestic, mountains\r\nformed the other; and this valley so rich and fertile, so gay with\r\ncornfields, brown meadows, potato gardens, and the brilliant green of\r\nthe flax, so varied and so beautiful in the bright mingling of Nature's\r\nskilful husbandry, was the 'Madman's Glen.' I felt amazed and\r\nbewildered, for I had expected to see a gloomy solitude, with horrid\r\ncrags and gloomy precipices. Not at all; the finest and richest valley\r\nwhich has greeted my eyes since we entered the Highlands of Kerry is\r\nthis--smiling, soft, and lovely.\r\n\r\n\"We took our leave of fair Glenagalt, and assuredly if any aspect of\r\nexternal nature could work such a blessed change, the repose, peace, and\r\nplenty of this charming valley would restore the unsettled brain of a\r\npoor unfortunate.\"[39]\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Eugene O'Curry, in his work on the \"Manners and\r\nCustoms of the Ancient Irish,\" published in 1873, makes no reference to\r\nmadness, idiocy, or possession. He refers to a sort of witchcraft under\r\nthe head of divination, where he gives an instance of a trance produced\r\nby magical arts; of the mad rage of the hero, and of how, in the midst\r\nof that rage, he was caught, as it were, by the hands and feet, through\r\nDruidical incantations.[40]\r\n\r\nReturning to England, let the reader imagine himself in London in the\r\nearly and middle part of the sixteenth century. There, in St. Giles's,\r\nmight have been seen a physician, Dr. Borde, who, born in 1490 in\r\nSussex, had made some practice in the metropolis, including that of\r\nmental disorders. He had been a Carthusian monk, but was \"dispensed of\r\nreligion,\" studied medicine, and followed the medical profession, first\r\nat Glasgow, and then in London. What, it may be asked, would have been\r\nhis method of caring for lunatics? The answer may be found in a curious\r\nbook which he wrote, entitled \"A Compendious Rygment or a Dyetry of\r\nHelth,\" and published in 1542.[41] There are several references, of much\r\ninterest, to insanity. One chapter of the book is headed, \"An order and\r\na dyett for them the whiche be madde and out of theyr wytte.\" In it the\r\ndoctor says, \"I do advertyse every man the whiche is madde or lunatycke\r\nor frantycke or demonyacke, to be kepte in safegarde in some close house\r\nor chamber where there is lytell light; and that we have a keeper the\r\nwhiche the madde man do feare.\" The remainder is conceived in quite a\r\nkindly spirit. The patient is to have no knife or shears; no girdle,\r\nexcept a weak list of cloth, lest he destroy himself; no pictures of man\r\nor woman on the wall, lest he have fantasies. He is to be shaved once a\r\nmonth, to drink no wine or strong beer, but \"warm suppynges three tymes\r\na daye, and a lytell warm meat.\" Few words are to be used except for\r\nreprehension or gentle reformation.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the way in which a well-intentioned doctor would take\r\ncare of a lunatic in the reign of Henry VIII. We wish that all the\r\ntreatment pursued had been as considerate. That it was not so we shall\r\nsee; but I would first add the curious experience of Dr. Borde in Rome,\r\nwhich he visited, and where he witnessed the treatment of a lunatic\r\nwhich was very singular, and founded on the vulgar notion of his being\r\npossessed. He says that to a marble pillar near St. Peter's, persons\r\nsupposed to be possessed, that is, insane, were brought, and said to be\r\ncured. A German lady was the patient when the English physician was the\r\nspectator, and he describes her as being taken violently by some twenty\r\nmen to the pillar, or rather into it, for it appears to have contained a\r\nchamber; \"and after her did go in a priest, and did examine the woman in\r\nthis manner. 'Thou devil or devils, I adjure thee by the potential power\r\nof the Father and the Son our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the virtue of\r\nthe Holy Ghost, that thou do show to me for what cause thou doest\r\npossess this woman?'\" What words were answered, Dr. Borde says he will\r\nnot write, \"for men will not believe it, but would say it were a foul\r\nand great lie.\" What he heard made him afraid to tarry, lest the demons\r\nshould have come out of her and entered into him. We are not left in\r\ndoubt as to his belief in the possession of lunatics. \"I considering\r\nthis,\" he says, \"and weke of faith and afeard crossed myself and durst\r\nnot hear and see such matters for it was so stupendous and above all\r\nreason if I should write it.\" It is certainty a pity that the worthy\r\ndoctor did not stay longer to watch, and to record in his graphic\r\nlanguage, the effect of the treatment.\r\n\r\nFrom the same motives lunatics in Great Britain were bound to holy\r\ncrosses. Sir David Lyndsay, in his poem called \"Monarche,\" written\r\nnearly four hundred years ago, says--\r\n\r\n    \"They bryng mad men on fuit and horsse,\r\n     And byndes theme to Saint Mangose Crosse.\"\r\n\r\nTo this cross (at Lotherwerd, now Borthwick, county Edinburgh), says an\r\nold writer, Jocelin, a monk of Furness, \"many labouring under various\r\ndisorders, and especially the furious and those vexed with demons, are\r\nbound in the evening; and in the morning they are often found sane and\r\nwhole, and are restored to their liberty.\"[42]\r\n\r\nThe resort to pillars of churches is illustrated by what an Augustine\r\nCanon of Scone says, in a work on the rule of his foundation (Paris,\r\n1508), for he protests against the desecration of churches, _with the\r\nexception of curing lunatics_ in the way I have just described, as being\r\nbound to the church pillars.\r\n\r\nNearly a hundred years after Dr. Borde wrote, that remarkable work was\r\npublished, \"The Anatomy of Melancholy,\" by Burton. Some quaint lines and\r\na rough engraving on the title-page illustrate but too well the\r\ntreatment of the insane familiar to him, although not a physician; it\r\nseems worse, instead of better, than that of the doctor of St. Giles.\r\n\r\n    \"But see the madman rage downright\r\n     With furious looks, a ghastly sight!\r\n     Naked in chains bound doth he lie\r\n     And roars amain, he knows not why.\"\r\n\r\nThe first edition of Burton's work was published in 1621, five years\r\nafter the death of Shakespeare, who speaks, in \"As You Like It\" (Act\r\niii. sc. 2), of madmen deserving \"a dark house and a whip,\" and in\r\n\"Twelfth Night\" makes Sir Toby say of Malvolio (Act iii. scene 4),\r\n\"Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound.\" The medical treatment\r\nof melancholia contained in Burton consists mainly of herbs, as borage,\r\nsupposed to affect the heart, poppies to act on the head, eupatory\r\n(teazel) on the liver, wormwood on the stomach, and endive to purify the\r\nblood. Vomits of white hellebore or antimony, and purges of black\r\nhellebore or aloes, are prescribed.\r\n\r\nThe famous \"Herbal\" of Gerarde, published in 1597, gives various\r\nremedies for madness, but they are, unfortunately, copied for the most\r\npart from Dioscorides, Galen, and other ancient writers. They are so far\r\nof interest that they show what was accepted as the best-known drug\r\npractice at the time in England in mental disorders. Under \"A Medicine\r\nagainst Madnesse\" we have rhubarb and wild thyme, the latter being \"a\r\nright singular remedie to cure them that have had a long phrensie or\r\nlethargie.\" He is here only following Aetius, and when he says, \"Besides\r\nits singular effects in splenetical matters, it helpeth any disease of\r\nmelancholy,\" he appears to follow Galen. Feverfew is said to be \"good\r\nfor such as be melancholike, sad, pensive, and without speech.\" Syrup\r\nmade of flowers of borage \"comforteth the heart, purgeth the melancholy,\r\nand quieteth the phrenticke or lunaticke person.\" Hellebore, of course,\r\nhas its virtues recognized. Black hellebore, or the Christmas rose,\r\n\"purgeth all melancholy humors, yet not without trouble and difficultie,\r\ntherefore it is not to be given but to robustious and strong bodies as\r\nMesues teacheth. It is good for mad and furious men, for melancholy,\r\ndull, and heavy persons, for those that are troubled with the falling\r\nsickness (epilepsy),\" and \"briefely for all those that are troubled with\r\nblacke choler, and molested with melancholy.\"[43]\r\n\r\nGerarde strongly commends \"that noble and famous confection _Alkermes_,\r\nmade by the Arabians,\" containing the grains of the scarlet oak (_Ilex\r\ncoccigera_). \"It is good against melancholy deseases, vaine\r\nimaginations, sighings, griefe and sorrow without manifest cause, for\r\nthat it purgeth away melancholy humors\" (p. 1343). Poultices applied to\r\nthe head, of mustard and figs, are recommended for epilepsy and\r\nlethargy. Gerarde adopts from Apuleius the virtues of double yellow and\r\nwhite batchelor's buttons, hung \"in a linnen cloath about the necke of\r\nhim that is lunaticke, in the waine of the moone, when the signe shall\r\nbe in the first degree of Taurus or Scorpio.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal remedies for insanity given by Gerarde, original\r\nand second hand.\r\n\r\nReturning to Burton, it should be said that among the causes of the\r\ndisease he distinctly recognizes the same uncanny influence that his\r\ncontemporaries Coke and Hale regarded as a legal fact--I mean\r\nwitchcraft. After saying that \"many deny witches altogether, or, if\r\nthere be any, assert that they can do no harm,\" of which opinion, he\r\nadds, \"is our countryman (Reginald) Scot (of Kent),[44] but of the\r\ncontrary opinion are most lawyers, physicians, and philosophers,\" he\r\nproceeds, \"They can cause tempests, etc., which is familiarly practised\r\nby witches in Norway, as I have proved, and, last of all, cure and cause\r\nmost diseases to such as they hate, _as this of Melancholy among the\r\nrest_.\"[45]\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, What was the medical knowledge or practice at the time\r\nof Coke and Hale, to which they would turn for direction when insanity\r\ncame before them in the courts of law? and I think a correct reply would\r\nbe best obtained by taking this wonderful book of Burton's, the works of\r\nSir Thomas Browne, who gave evidence before Hale, and what may be called\r\nthe case-book of the celebrated Court physician, Sir Theodore de\r\nMayerne. A Genevese, he settled in England in 1606, and was regarded as\r\nthe highest authority in mental and nervous affections. A medical work\r\nof his was translated into Latin by Bonet. Mayerne's treatment was\r\ncertainly of a somewhat cumbrous character, and his patients must have\r\nhad an unusual and commendable amount of perseverance if they pursued it\r\nthoroughly. The drugs probably cured in part, at least, from the duty\r\nentailed upon the patients of collecting the numerous herbs which were\r\nordered for the composition of the mixture, and Sir Theodore truly and\r\nnaively remarks to one of his patients, \"It will take some time before\r\nyou have mixed your medicine.\" It is clear that he was under the\r\ninfluence of the old belief in the connection between the liver and\r\ninsanity, and the paramount importance of getting rid of the black bile.\r\nOf one case he asserts that the root of all the griefs wherewith the\r\npatient has been afflicted is a melancholy humour, generated in the\r\nliver and wrought upon in the spleen. This humour is stated to be mixed\r\nin the veins, and so extended to the brain, which this offensive enemy\r\nof nature doth assault as an organical part. Hence, he says, it happens\r\nthat the principal functions of the soul do act erroneously. His\r\ntreatment consisted of emetics, purges, opening the veins under the\r\ntongue, blisters, issues, and shaving the head, followed by a cataplasm\r\nupon it, the backbone anointed with a very choice balsam of earthworms\r\nor bats. One prescription for melancholia contains no less than\r\ntwenty-seven ingredients, to be made into a decoction, to which is to be\r\nadded that _sine qua non_, the ever precious hellebore. Other remedies\r\nwere prescribed; in some cases the \"bezoartick pastills,\" composed of an\r\nimmense number of ingredients, including the skull of a stag and of a\r\nhealthy man who had been executed. The commentary triumphantly made by\r\nthis lover of polypharmacy in the case in which this medicine was\r\nadministered, runs thus:--\"These things being exactly performed, this\r\nnoble gentleman was cured.\" With certain modifications, the general\r\ntreatment here indicated was that in fashion at the period to which I\r\nrefer, and was based on a strong conviction of the presence of certain\r\npeccant humours in the body, affecting the brain, which required\r\nelimination.\r\n\r\nMayerne, of whom there is a portrait in the College of Physicians, was\r\nphysician to more crowned heads than has fallen to the lot of probably\r\nany other doctor, namely, Henry IV. of France, James I. of England, his\r\nqueen, Anne of Denmark, Charles I., and Charles II. He introduced\r\ncalomel into practice. Dying in 1654/5, he was buried in the church of\r\nSt. Martin's-in-the-Fields, where a monument was erected to his\r\nmemory.[46]\r\n\r\nThe royal author of the book on Demonology (first published in\r\n1597)--the high and mighty Prince James--gives sundry learned reasons\r\nwhy witches are not to be regarded as mad, and why, therefore, the plea\r\nof insanity should be rejected in the legal tribunals. Written in the\r\nform of a dialogue between Philomathes and Epistemon, the latter, who\r\npersonates the king, says, \"As to your second reason (that Witchcraft is\r\nbut very melancholique imagination of simple raving creatures), grounded\r\nupon Physicke, in attributing the confessions or apprehensions of\r\nWitches to a natural melancholique humour, any one that pleased\r\nphysikally to consider upon the natural humour of Melancholy, according\r\nto all the physicians that ever writ thereupon, shall find that that\r\nwill be over short a cloake to cover their knavery with.\"[47]\r\n\r\nJames is very wroth with Reginald Scot and Wierus[48] for their\r\nopposition to the prevalent belief, and urges, as proof of the existence\r\nof witches (\"which have never fallen out so clear in any age or\r\nnation\"), daily experience and their confessions. Reginald Scot had\r\ndared to write, in his \"Discovery of Witchcraft\" (1584): \"Alas, I am\r\nsorry and ashamed to see how many die who being said to be bewitched,\r\nonly seek for magical cures, whom wholesome diet and good medicines\r\nwould have recovered.... These affections tho' they appear in the mind\r\nof man, yet are they bred in the body and proceed from the humour which\r\nis the very dregs of the blood; nourishing those places from whence\r\nproceed fear, cogitations, superstitions, fastings, labours, and such\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\nIt is striking to observe how much more enlightened this writer was than\r\na physician to whom I have already referred, Sir Thomas Browne. His\r\nfamous sentence, in which he gives full credence to witches, makes us\r\nobliged to admit that when so distinguished a man entertained such\r\nsuperstitious notions, we cannot be much surprised if contemporary\r\njudges regarded many of the really insane as witches, although they had\r\nbefore them the enlightened opinions of Reginald Scot.\r\n\r\nThe history of _incubi_, or \"night-comers,\" is doubtless, to a large\r\nextent, a narrative of the hallucinations, delusions, and automatic\r\nthoughts of the insane, although to _what_ extent would be a difficult\r\nquestion to determine, because some were assuredly frightened into the\r\nconfessions which they made; and, further, it is hard to say how much of\r\na certain belief was due to the current popular ignorance and credulity,\r\nand how much to actual mental disease. Still the ignorant opinions of an\r\nage find their _nisus_ and most rapid development in persons of weak or\r\ndiseased mind, and they form the particular delusion manifested; and at\r\na period when witches are universally believed in, there must be some\r\nreason why one believes he or she has had transactions with Satan, and\r\nanother does not believe it. It is, indeed, impossible to read the\r\nnarratives of some of the unfortunate hags who were put to death for\r\nwitchcraft, without recognizing the well-marked features of the victims\r\nof cerebral disorder. In this way I have no doubt a considerable number\r\nof mad people were destroyed. Their very appearance suggested to their\r\nneighbours the notion of something weird and impish; the physiognomy of\r\nmadness was mistaken for that of witchcraft, while the poor wretches\r\nthemselves, conscious of unaccustomed sensations and singular\r\npromptings, referred them to the agency of demons. Strangely enough,\r\neven an inquisitor--Nider, who died in 1440--gives many instances of\r\npersons whose symptoms he himself recognized as those not of possession,\r\nbut of madness.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the treatment of the unfortunate\r\nlunatics and epileptics who were judged to be witches by James I. was\r\nnothing else than death, and he thus coolly comments on this punishment:\r\n\"It is commonly used by fire, but that is an indifferent thing, to be\r\nused in every country, according to the law or custom thereof.\"[49]\r\n\r\nI cannot pass from this subject without doing honour to two men who\r\nabroad, no less than Reginald Scot in Britain, opposed the immolation of\r\nlunatics--Wierus, physician to the Duke of Cleves, who wrote a\r\nremarkable work in 1567, and appealed to the princes of Europe to cease\r\nshedding innocent blood; and Cornelius Agrippa,[50] who interfered in\r\nthe trial of a so-called witch in Brabant, having sore contention with\r\nan inquisitor, who through unjust accusations drew a poor woman into his\r\nbutchery, not so much to examine as to torment her. When Agrippa\r\nundertook to defend her, alleging there was no proof of sorcery, the\r\ninquisitor replied, \"One thing there is which is proof and matter\r\nsufficient; for her mother was in times past burnt for a witch.\" When\r\nAgrippa retorted that this had reference to another person, and\r\ntherefore ought not to be admitted by the judge, the inquisitor was\r\nequal to the occasion, and replied that witchcraft was naturally\r\nengrafted into this child, because the parents used to sacrifice their\r\nchildren to the devil as soon as they were born. On this Agrippa boldly\r\nexclaimed, \"Oh, thou wicked priest, is this thy divinity? Dost thou use\r\nto draw poor guiltless women to the rack by these forged devices? Dost\r\nthou with such sentences judge others to be heretics, thou being a\r\ngreater heretic than either Faustus or Donatus?\" The natural consequence\r\nwas that the inquisitor then threatened to proceed against the advocate\r\nhimself as a supporter of witches; nevertheless, he continued his\r\ndefence of the unhappy woman, who, whether a lunatic or not, was\r\ndelivered, we read, by him \"from the claws of the bloody monk, who, with\r\nher accuser, was condemned in a great sum of money, and remained\r\ninfamous after that time to almost all men.\"\r\n\r\nScot, who cites this case, shows great familiarity with examples of\r\nmelancholy and delusion, and from his work have been derived many of the\r\nbest known illustrations of the latter, including the delusions of being\r\nmonarchs, brute beasts, and earthen pots greatly fearing to be broken.\r\nThe old story of the patient who thought Atlas weary of upholding the\r\nheavens and would let the sky fall upon him, is narrated by this author,\r\nas well as that of the man who believed his nose to be as big as a\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIt comes then, to this--to revert to the question, what was the medical\r\nknowledge or practice at the time of Coke and Hale, to which they would\r\nturn for direction when insanity came before them in the Courts of\r\nLaw?--that when the lawyers went to the doctors for light they got\r\nsurprisingly little help. They had better have confined themselves to\r\nreading the old Greek and Roman books on medicine, of which the medical\r\npractice of that period was but a servile imitation, and not have added,\r\nfrom their belief in witchcraft, the horrible punishment of lunatics,\r\nwhich in our country extended over the period between 1541 and 1736,\r\nwhen the laws against witchcraft were abolished. The last judicial\r\nmurder of a witch in the British Isles (Sutherlandshire) was in 1722.\r\n\r\nLeaving now the insane who were punished as witches, I pass on to remark\r\nthat in Percy's \"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry,\" it is stated that\r\nthe English have more songs and ballads on the subject of madness than\r\nany of their neighbours. \"Whether,\" the writer proceeds, \"there be any\r\ntruth in the insinuation that we are more liable to this calamity than\r\nother nations,[51] or that our native gloominess hath peculiarly\r\nrecommended subjects of this class to our writers, we certainly do not\r\nfind the same in the printed collections of French and Italian songs.\"\r\nHalf a dozen so-called mad songs are selected. These refer to much the\r\nsame period as that we have been considering; and, in fact, we come upon\r\nthe \"Old Tom of Bedlam,\" or Cranke or Abram man, who \"would swear he had\r\nbeen in Bedlam, and would talk frantickly of purpose,\" so notorious in\r\nconnection with the beggary which endeavoured to make capital out of the\r\nasylum most familiar to our ancestors of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. In this light the Bedlam beggars appear in \"King Lear\"--\r\n\r\n    \"The country gives me proof and precedent\r\n     Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,\r\n     Stick in their numb'd and mortify'd bare arms\r\n     Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;\"\r\n\r\nand these enforce their charity by lunatic \"bans,\" that is, by licences\r\nto beg under the badge of the Star of Bethlehem.\r\n\r\nSome doggerel from the most ancient of the Percy \"Reliques\" will serve\r\nfor a sample of the rest:\r\n\r\n    \"Forth from my sad and darksome cell,\r\n     Or from the deepe abysse of Hell,\r\n     Mad Tom is come into the world againe,\r\n     To see if he can cure his distemper'd braine.\"\r\n\r\nTom appears to have brought away with him some of his fetters, then\r\nsufficiently abundant in Bedlam:\r\n\r\n    \"Come, Vulcan, with tools and with tackles,\r\n     To knocke off my troublesome shackles.\"\r\n\r\n_This_ method of treatment--by fetters--has not, it may be well to\r\nstate, survived, like immersion, in the practice of the present Master\r\nof Bedlam.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Shakespeare how \"poor Tom that eats the swimming frog, the\r\ntoad, the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water [newt]; ... swallows the\r\nold rat, and the ditch-dog;\" and \"drinks the green mantle of the\r\nstanding pool,\" was \"whipped from tything to tything, and stocked,\r\npunished, and imprisoned....\r\n\r\n    Mice, and rats, and such small deere\r\n    Have been Tom's food for seven long yeare.\"[52]\r\n\r\nWhipping-posts were very common in the reign of Henry VIII., and we\r\nsuppose long before; certainly also much later. About the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century an old poet, John Taylor, once a waterman on the\r\nThames, and hence called the \"Water Poet,\" wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"In London, and within one mile, I ween,\r\n     There are of jails and prisons full eighteen,\r\n     And _sixty whipping-posts_ and stocks and cages.\"\r\n\r\nThe whipping-post was sometimes called the \"tree of truth.\" There is a\r\ncurious passage in Sir Thomas More's works, in which he orders a lunatic\r\nto be bound to a tree and soundly beaten with rods.\r\n\r\n\"There was a tree in Sir Thomas More's garden, at which he so often beat\r\nLutherans, that it was called the 'tree of troth,'\" says Burnet. This\r\nwas not the tree at which he had the poor lunatic flogged, for he says\r\nthat was in the street.\r\n\r\n\"It was a good plea in those days to an action for assault, battery, and\r\nfalse imprisonment, that the plaintiff was a lunatic, and that therefore\r\nthe defendant had arrested him, confined him, and _whipped_ him.\"[53]\r\n\r\nWhipping-posts may still be seen in some villages in England, in the\r\nvicinity of stocks. Of course they were largely employed for idle\r\nvagabonds, but many really insane people suffered. The following item\r\nfrom the constable's account at Great Staughton, Huntingdonshire,\r\nillustrates the custom of whipping wandering lunatics:--\"1690/1. Paid in\r\ncharges, taking up a distracted woman, watching her and whipping her\r\nnext day, 8s. 6d.\"[54]\r\n\r\nLet me here refer for a moment to the \"brank.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"brank\" or \"scold's bridle\" was very probably used in former days\r\nfor lunatics--an instrument of torture which has received much\r\nelucidation from my friend Dr. Brushfield, the late medical\r\nsuperintendent of Brookwood Asylum. Indeed, it is certain that it, or a\r\nsimilar gag, called the \"witch's bridle,\" was employed for these\r\nunfortunate suspects, of whom so many, as we have good reason to\r\nconclude, were insane or hystero-epileptics. In the church steeple at\r\nForfar one was preserved, within recent times, with the date 1661.[55]\r\nArchdeacon Hale many years ago suggested that the \"brank\" was used to\r\ncheck noisy lunatics of the female sex; and in reference to this, Dr.\r\nBrushfield remarks: \"Medical officers of asylums can always point out\r\nmany female patients who, if they had been living a couple of centuries\r\nback, would undoubtedly have been branked as scolds. One of the female\r\nlunatics in the Cheshire Asylum gave me, a few days since, a very\r\ngraphic account of the manner in which she had been bridled some years\r\nago whilst an inmate of a workhouse.\"[56]\r\n\r\nNo doubt, in addition to branks and whipping-posts, the pillory and\r\nstocks, and probably the ducking-stool, were made use of for unruly and\r\ncrazy people, who nowadays would be comfortably located in an asylum.\r\n\r\nWhat now, let us ask in conclusion, are the practical inferences to draw\r\nfrom the descriptions which I have given respecting the popular and\r\nmedical treatment of lunatics in the good old times in the British\r\nIsles?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we see that the nature of the malady under which the\r\ninsane laboured was completely misunderstood; that they often passed as\r\nwitches and possessed by demons, and were tortured as such and burnt at\r\nthe stake, when their distempered minds ought to have been gently and\r\nskilfully treated. Some, however, were recognized by the monks as simply\r\nlunatic, and were treated by the administration of herbs, along with, in\r\nmany instances, some superstitious accompaniment, illustrating, when\r\nsuccessful, the influence of the imagination.\r\n\r\nFurther, the medical treatment, so far as it made any pretension to\r\nmethods of cure, was either purely empirical, or founded upon the one\r\nnotion that descended from generation to generation from the earliest\r\nantiquity--that there was an excess of bile in the blood, and that it\r\nmust be expelled by emetics or purgatives.\r\n\r\nAgain, there was the more violent remedy of flagellation, one always\r\npopular and easy of application; equally efficacious, too, whether\r\nregarded as a punishment for violent acts, or as a means of thrashing\r\nout the supposed demon lurking in the body and the real cause of the\r\nmalady. And there was, of course, as the primary treatment, seclusion in\r\na dark room and fetters.\r\n\r\nTo anticipate what belongs to subsequent chapters, we may say here that\r\nwhen the insane were no longer treated in monasteries, or brought to\r\nsacred wells, or flogged at \"trees of truth,\" they fared no better--nay,\r\nI think, often worse--when they were shut up in mad-houses and crowded\r\ninto workhouses. They were too often under the charge of brutal keepers,\r\nwere chained to the wall or in their beds, where they lay in dirty\r\nstraw, and frequently, in the depth of winter, without a rag to cover\r\nthem. It is difficult to understand why and how they continued to live;\r\nwhy their caretakers did not, except in the case of profitable patients,\r\nkill them outright; and why, failing this--which would have been a\r\nkindness compared with the prolonged tortures to which they were\r\nsubjected--death did not come sooner to their relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Collected and edited by the Rev.

LUKE'S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief point of interest in the subject to which this chapter has\r\nreference, centres in the questions where and what was the provision\r\nmade for the insane in England at the earliest period in which we can\r\ndiscover traces or their custody?\r\n\r\nMany, I suppose, are familiar with the fact of the original foundation\r\nin 1247 of a Priory in Bishopsgate Street, for the Order of St. Mary of\r\nBethlem, but few are aware at what period it was used for the care or\r\nconfinement of lunatics, and still fewer have any knowledge of the form\r\nof the building of the first Bethlem Hospital--the word \"Bethlem\" soon\r\ndegenerating into _Bedlam_.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the less known facts, I would observe that an\r\nalderman and sheriff of London, Simon FitzMary, gave in the thirty-first\r\nyear of the reign of Henry III., 1247, to the Bishop and Church of\r\nBethlem, in Holyland, all his houses and grounds in the parish of St.\r\nBotolph without Bishopsgate, that there might be thereupon built a\r\nHospital or Priory for a prior, canons, brethren, and sisters of the\r\nOrder of Bethlem or the Star of Bethlem, wherein the Bishop of Bethlem\r\nwas to be entertained when he came to England, and to whose visitation\r\nand correction all the members of the house were subjected.[57]\r\n\r\nThe following is the wording of the original grant, slightly\r\nabridged:--\"To all the children of our Mother holy Church, to whom this\r\npresent writing shall come, Simon, the Son of Mary, sendeth greeting in\r\nour Lord, ... having special and singular devotion to the Church of the\r\nglorious Virgin at Bethelem, where the same Virgin brought forth our\r\nSaviour incarnate, and lying in the Cratch,[58] and with her own milk\r\nnourished; and where the same child to us being born, the Chivalry of\r\nthe Heavenly Company sange the new hymne, Gloria in excelsis Deo ... a\r\nnew Starre going before them. In the Honour and Reverence of the same\r\nchild, and his most meek mother, and to the exaltation of my most noble\r\nLord, Henry King of England, ... and to the manifold increase of this\r\nCity of London, in which I was born: and also for the health of my soul,\r\nand the souls of my predecessors and successors, my father, mother and\r\nmy friends, I have given, and by this my present Charter, here, have\r\nconfirmed to God, and to the Church of St. Mary of Bethelem, all my\r\nLands which I have in the Parish of St. Buttolph, without Bishopsgate of\r\nLondon, ... in houses, gardens, pools, ponds, ditches, and pits, and all\r\ntheir appurtenances as they be closed in by their bounds, which now\r\nextend in length from the King's high street, East, to the great Ditch,\r\nin the West, the which is called Depeditch; and in breadth to the lands\r\nof Ralph Dunnyng, in the North; and to the land of the Church of St.\r\nButtolph in the South; ... to make there a Priory, and to ordain a Prior\r\nand Canons, brothers and also sisters, who in the same place, the Rule\r\nand Order of the said Church of Bethelem solemnly professing, shall bear\r\nthe Token of a Starre openly in their Coapes and Mantles of profession,\r\nand for to say Divine Service there, for the souls aforesaid, and all\r\nChristian souls, and specially to receive there, the Bishop of Bethelem,\r\nCanons, brothers, and messengers of the Church of Bethelem for ever\r\nmore, as often as they shall come thither. And that a Church or Oratory\r\nthere shall be builded, as soon as our Lord shall enlarge his grace,\r\nunder such form, that the Order, institution of Priors, &c. to the\r\nBishop of Bethelem and his successors shall pertain for evermore.... And\r\nLord Godfrey, Bishop of Bethelem, into bodily possession, I have\r\nindented and given to his possession all the aforesaid Lands; which\r\npossession he hath received, and entered in form aforesaid.\r\n\r\n\"And in token of subjection and reverence, the said place in London\r\nshall pay yearly a mark sterling at Easter to the Bishop of Bethelem.\r\n\r\n\"This gift and confirmation of my Deed, & the putting to of my Seal for\r\nme and mine heirs, I have steadfastly made strong, the year of our Lord\r\nGod, 1247, the Wednesday after the Feast of St. Luke the Evangelist.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that Simon Fitzmary's land extended from the King's\r\nHighway on the east (Bishopsgate Street without) to the fosse called\r\nDepeditch on the west. The land of Saint Botolph Church bounded it on\r\nthe south, and the property of a Ralph Dunnyng on the north. The author\r\nof \"The History of St. Botolph\" (1824), Mr. T. L. Smartt, suggests that\r\nthe old White Hart Tavern is a vestige of the hostelry. If not forming\r\npart of the original hospital, it certainly led to it. Among the tokens\r\nin the British Museum I find \"Bedlem Tokens E.{K.}E. at Bedlam Gate,\r\n1657,\" and the \"Reverse at the White Hart.\" At an early period Bethlem\r\nis styled \"Bethlem Prison House,\" and the patients, \"who sometimes\r\nexceeded the number of twenty,\" are called prisoners. One token at the\r\nBritish Museum is G.{H.}A. \"at the Old Prison.\"\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of this site is occupied at the present day by\r\nLiverpool Street, and the railway stations which have sprung up there.\r\n\r\nThe topographer in search of the old site finds striking proofs of the\r\nchanges which six hundred years have brought with them--the steam, and\r\nthe shrill sounds of the Metropolitan, North London, and Great Eastern\r\nRailways; while Bethlem Gate, the entrance to the hospital from\r\nBishopsgate Street, was, when I last visited the spot, superseded by\r\nhoardings covered with the inevitable advertisement of the paper which\r\nenjoys the largest circulation in the world. Depeditch is now Bloomfield\r\nStreet. The name of Ralph Dunnyng, whose property is mentioned in the\r\ncharter as bounding Bethlem on the north, is, I suppose, represented,\r\nafter the lapse of six centuries, by Dunning's Alley and Place.\r\n\r\nThere was a churchyard on the property, which was enclosed for the use\r\nof adjoining parishes by Sir Thomas Rowe, Lord Mayor of London, at a\r\nmuch later period (1569)--no doubt the ground where the inmates were\r\nburied. The Broad Street Railway Station booking-office is situated upon\r\npart of its site. In connection with this, I may refer to a statement in\r\nMr. Buckland's \"Curiosities of Natural History,\" to the effect that a\r\nskeleton, on which fetters were riveted, was found in 1863, in St. Mary\r\nAxe, by some workmen engaged in excavations. Mr. Buckland states, on the\r\nauthority of Mr. Hancock, that Sir Thomas Rowe gave ground in St. Mary\r\nAxe, for the use of Old Bethlem Hospital and certain adjoining parishes.\r\nMr. Buckland, therefore, concluded that the skeleton was that of a man\r\nwho had been a patient in Bedlam, and buried in his chains. He was on\r\none occasion good enough to place them at my disposal, but as I can find\r\nno evidence that Sir T. Rowe did more than what I have above stated, I\r\nthink there is no connection proved between the skeleton in irons and\r\nBedlam.\r\n\r\nIn this churchyard was buried Lodowick Muggleton--an appropriate\r\nresting-place, considering its proximity to a mad-house. Also John\r\nLilburne; four thousand persons, it is said, attending his funeral.\r\n\r\nMr. Roach Smith, who formerly lived in Liverpool Street, informs me that\r\non one occasion an incident proved the former existence of a\r\nburial-ground on this spot. He writes, \"Opposite my house (No. 5) on the\r\nother side of the street was a long dead wall, which separated the\r\nstreet from a long piece of garden-ground which faced some high houses\r\nstanding, probably, on the site of Bedlam. This garden may have stood on\r\nthe burial-ground. When my man buried in it a deceased favourite cat, he\r\nsaid he came upon the remains of human skeletons. But revolution brought\r\nabout the disturbance of the cat which had disturbed some of old\r\nLondon's people. A few years since the cat's coffin and her epitaph were\r\nbrought before the directors of a railway as a very puzzling discovery.\"\r\nThe engineers of the North London and Great Eastern Railways inform me\r\nthat many bones were dug up in excavating for the Broad Street and\r\nLiverpool Street Stations.\r\n\r\nThe locality of the first Bethlem Hospital is, I hope, now clearly\r\nbefore the reader. I will describe the form of the buildings shortly,\r\nbut will first trace the history of the convent to the time of Henry\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1330, eighty-three years after its foundation, it is\r\nmentioned as a \"hospital,\" in a licence granted by King Edward III., to\r\ncollect alms in England, Ireland, and Wales, but it must not be\r\ninferred from this that it was _necessarily_ used for the sick, as the\r\nword hospital was then, and long after, employed as \"a place for shelter\r\nor entertainment\" (Johnson). It is so employed by Spencer in the \"Faerie\r\nQueen\":--\r\n\r\n    \"They spy'd a goodly castle plac'd\r\n     Foreby a river in a pleasant dale,\r\n     Which chusing for that evening's _Hospital_\r\n     They thither march'd.\"\r\n\r\nVery shortly after this, viz. in 1346, the monastery or hospital was so\r\nmiserably poor that the master applied to the mayor, aldermen, and\r\ncitizens of London to be received under their protection. This was\r\nagreed to, and it was governed afterwards by two aldermen, one chosen by\r\nthe mayor and the other by the monastery.\r\n\r\nThen we come to an important event--the seizure of Bethlem by the Crown.\r\nThis was in 1375, the forty-eighth year of Edward III. It was done on\r\nthe pretext that it was an alien or foreign priory. There was not\r\ntherefore any seizing of the monastery by Henry VIII., as is usually\r\nstated. That had been done already. The master of Bethlem stated at this\r\ntime that the annual value of the house was six marks; and that he paid\r\n13s. 4d. a year to the Bishop of Bethlem, and 40s. rent to the Guildhall\r\nfor the benefit of the City. Disputes afterwards arose between the Crown\r\nand the City as to their right to appoint the master of the house, but\r\nthe former triumphed, and Richard II., Henry IV., Henry VI., and Henry\r\nVIII. insisted upon and exercised their right of presentation.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the City had let some house to the hospital for which\r\nthey received rent. And further, that afterwards, when disputes arose,\r\nthey actually pretended that the hospital itself was originally theirs.\r\n\r\nI now call attention to the year 1403, the fourth year of Henry IV. It\r\nseems that Peter, the porter of the house, had misbehaved himself in\r\nsome way, and it was deemed sufficiently important to necessitate an\r\n\"inquisition,\" to ascertain the condition and management of the\r\nmonastery. And it is here that we meet with the earliest indication of\r\nBethlem being a receptacle for the insane. I have examined the Report of\r\nthis Royal Commission, and find it stated that six men were confined\r\nthere who were lunatics (_sex homines mente capti_). The number,\r\ntherefore, was very small at that time. As might be expected, the\r\nglimpse we get of their mode of treatment reveals the customary\r\nrestraints of former days. The inventory records \"Six chains of iron,\r\nwith six locks; four pairs of manacles of iron, and two pairs of\r\nstocks.\" I do not here, or elsewhere, find any reference to the use of\r\nthe whip. I may remark, by the way, that the Commissioners observe that\r\nwhereas originally the master of the house wore the Star of the Order of\r\nBethlem, the master at that time did not. The original star contained\r\nsixteen points, which we may consider to indicate, appropriately, the\r\nwords _Estoile de Bethlem_.\r\n\r\nOn the arms of Bethlem[59] was also a basket of bread, in reference to\r\nthe Hebrew etymology, \"House of Bread.\" The bread is described as\r\nwastell cake, a word first met with in a statute 51 Hen. III., where it\r\nis described as white bread well baked.\r\n\r\nChaucer says of the \"Prioress\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Of small houndes hadde she, that she fedde\r\n     With roasted flesh, and milk and wastel brede.\"\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the word, according to Douce's \"Illustrations of\r\nShakespeare,\" is from gasteau, now _gateau_, anciently written gastel,\r\nand, in the Picard dialect, ouastel or watel, a cake.\r\n\r\nI would here draw attention to the site of St. Martin's Lane, and the\r\nadjoining district. At the southwest corner of St. Martin's Lane, in the\r\nangle formed by it and Charing Cross, was situated a religious (?)\r\nhouse, of the foundation of which I can discover nothing. The point of\r\ninterest to us in connection with it is this: that at a very early\r\nperiod lunatics were confined there. Stow, in his \"Survey of London,\"\r\netc., written in 1598, says, under \"The Citie of Westminster,\" \"From\r\nthence is now a continuall new building of diuers fayre houses euen up\r\nto the Earle of Bedford's house lately builded nigh to Iuy Bridge, and\r\nso on the north side, to a lane that turneth to the parish church of S.\r\nMartin's in the Field, in the liberty of Westminster. Then had ye an\r\nhouse, wherein some time were distraught and lunatike people, of what\r\nantiquity founded, or by whom, I have not read, neither of the\r\nsuppression; but it was said that some time a king of England, not\r\nliking such a kind of people to remaine so neare his pallace, caused\r\nthem to be removed further off to Bethlem without Bishopsgate of London,\r\nand to that Hospitall the said house by Charing Crosse doth yeth\r\nremaine.\"[60]\r\n\r\nI have spent considerable time in endeavouring to discover who this king\r\nwas, but without success. If we assume that this was the first time that\r\nBethlem received lunatics within its walls, we must refer the event to a\r\ndate prior to 1403, because we know, as I have pointed out, that there\r\nwere mad people in Bethlem at that date. One statement is that the\r\nsovereign was Henry IV., and that is not improbable, but it may have\r\nbeen Richard II. Whoever the king was, he appears to have been rather\r\nfastidious, considering the proximity is not very close between Charing\r\nCross and any of the Royal Palaces. Possibly, as the Royal \"Mewse\" was\r\nat Charing Cross, his Majesty, whenever he visited his falcons, which\r\nwere \"mewed\" or confined here--long before the same place was used for\r\nstables--may have been disturbed by the sounds he heard.[61] It is\r\ninteresting in this connection to learn that Chaucer was clerk of the\r\nCharing Cross Mews. On the site of the Mews stands now the National\r\nGallery, and the house for lunatics must have been situated in Trafalgar\r\nSquare, about where Havelock's equestrian statue stands.\r\n\r\nHere I may note also, on the same authority, that there was in Edward\r\nIII.'s reign (1370) a hospital founded in the parish of Barking by\r\nRobert Denton, \"chaplen,\" \"for the sustentation of poor Priests and\r\nother men and women that were sicke of the Phrenzie, there to remaine\r\ntill they were perfectly whole and restored to good memorie.\"[62] I know\r\nnothing further of this asylum. It must remain an undetermined question\r\nwhether there were any lunatics in Bedlam prior to the establishment of\r\nthe houses at Charing Cross and Barking. As, however, both these were\r\ndevoted to their exclusive care, and Bethlem at that period was not, I\r\nthink we must grant their priority as special houses for deranged\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in the passage cited from Stow, the house at\r\nCharing Cross is described as belonging to Bethlem Hospital. I have\r\nascertained that the Charing Cross property belonged to Bethlem Hospital\r\nuntil 1830, when it was sold or exchanged in order to allow of the\r\nimprovements which were shortly afterwards made there in laying out\r\nTrafalgar Square and building the National Gallery.\r\n\r\nWe know, then, that from about 1400--probably earlier--Bethlem received\r\nlunatics, on however small a scale; and we have here an explanation of\r\nthe fact which has occasioned surprise, that before the time of the\r\ncharter of Henry VIII., whose name is inscribed over the pediment of the\r\nexisting building, the word \"Bedlam\" is used for a madman or mad-house.\r\nThus Tyndale made use of the word some twenty years before the royal\r\ngrant in his \"Prologue to the Testament,\" a unique fragment of which\r\nexists in the British Museum, where he says it is \"bedlam madde to\r\naffirme that good is the natural cause of yvell.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Wolsey, Skelton, who died in 1529, says in his \"Why come ye\r\nnot to Court?\"--\r\n\r\n    \"He grinnes and he gapes,\r\n     As it were Jacke Napes,\r\n     Such a mad Bedlam.\"\r\n\r\nThe familiar expression \"Jackanapes\" is evidently a corruption of the\r\nabove. The term occurs in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\": \"I vill teach a\r\nscurvy jackanape priest to meddle or make.\"[63] The origin of the phrase\r\nin _Jack-o'naibs_, a Saracen game of cards, seems doubtful. Any way, it\r\ncame to be used for a witless fellow, or Bedlamite.\r\n\r\nAnd Sir Thomas More, in his treatise \"De Quatuor Novissimis,\" says,\r\n\"Think not that everything is pleasant that men for madness laugh at.\r\nFor thou shalt in Bedleem see one laugh at the knocking of his own hed\r\nagainst a post, and yet there is little pleasure therein.\" And, again,\r\nin the \"Apology\" made by him in 1533 (thirteen years before the grant),\r\nin which he gives a most curious account of the treatment of a poor\r\nlunatic: He was \"one which after that he had fallen into these frantick\r\nheresies, fell soon after into plaine open franzye beside. And all beit\r\nthat he had therefore bene put up in Bedelem, and afterward by beating\r\nand correccion gathered his remembraance to him and beganne to come\r\nagain to himselfe, being thereupon set at liberty, and walkinge aboute\r\nabrode, his old fansies beganne to fall againe in his heade.\" Although\r\nwhat follows has nothing to do with Bethlem, I cannot avoid quoting it,\r\nas it illustrates so graphically the whipping-post treatment of that\r\nday. \"I was fro dyvers good holy places advertised, that he used in his\r\nwandering about to come into the churche, and there make many mad toies\r\nand trifles, to the trouble of good people in the divine service, and\r\nspecially woulde he be most busye in the time of most silence, while the\r\npriest was at the secretes of the masse aboute the levacion.\" After\r\nproof of his indecent behaviour, he proceeds, \"Whereupon I beinge\r\nadvertised of these pageauntes, and beinge sent unto and required by\r\nvery devout relygious folke, to take some other order with him, caused\r\nhim, as he came wanderinge by my doore, to be taken by the connstables\r\nand bounden to a tree in the streete before the whole towne, and ther\r\nthey stripped [striped] him with roddes therefore till he waxed weary\r\nand somewhat lenger. And it appeared well that hys remembraunce was\r\ngoode ineoughe save that it went about in grazing [wool-gathering!] til\r\nit was beaten home. For he coulde then verye wel reherse his fautes\r\nhimselfe, and speake and treate very well, and promise to doe afterward\r\nas well.\" Sir Thomas More ends with this delicious sentence:--\"And\r\nverylye God be thanked I heare none harme of him now.\"[64]\r\n\r\nTo return to Bethlem Hospital. I can discover nothing of interest in\r\nregard to it between 1403 and 1523; except, indeed, that I observe in\r\nthe \"Memorials of London,\" 1276-1419, a man was punished for pretending\r\nto be a collector for the hospital of \"Bedlem,\" in 1412. He was to\r\nremain for one hour of the day in the pillory, the money-box he had used\r\nbeing \"in the mean time placed and tied to his neck.\" At the date\r\nmentioned above, 1523, Stephen Jennings, merchant taylor, previously\r\nLord Mayor of London, gave a sum of money in his will towards the\r\npurchase of the patronage of Bethlem Hospital. Three and twenty years\r\nlater (1546) the citizens of London are said to have purchased \"the\r\npatronage thereof, with all the lands and tenements thereunto\r\nbelonging.\" But there is no evidence that they did give any money for\r\nthis patronage. Sir John Gresham, the Lord Mayor, petitioned the king in\r\nthis year to grant Bethlem Hospital to the City; and the king did grant\r\nit along with St. Bartholomew's Hospital, on condition that the City\r\nshould expend a certain amount of money on new buildings in connection\r\nwith the latter. It is only in this sense, I believe, that they\r\n\"purchased\" Bethlem Hospital; and further, it must be understood that\r\nthe City obtained the patronage or government only, and not the freehold\r\nof the premises, although in process of time the Crown ceased to claim\r\nor possess any property in the hospital.\r\n\r\nIn the indenture of the covenant made 27th December, 1546, between the\r\nKing and the City of London granting St. Bartholomew's Hospital and\r\nBethlem, there is no mention of appropriating the latter to the use of\r\nlunatics (for this, as we have seen, had been done already), but it is\r\nsimply said \"the king granted to the said citizens that they and their\r\nsuccessors should thenceforth be masters, rulers, and governors of the\r\nhospital or house called Bethlem, and should have the governance of the\r\nsame and of the people there, with power to see and to cause the rents\r\nand profits of the lands and possessions of the same hospital to be\r\nemployed for the relief of the poor people there, according to the\r\nmeaning of the foundation of the same, or otherwise as it should please\r\nthe king for better order to devise.\" The charter was granted on the\r\n13th of January, 1547. The King died on the 29th. The value of the\r\nestate at this period is said to have been L504 12s. 11d.[65]\r\n\r\nI wish to reproduce here the form of the buildings of Bethlem (or, as we\r\nought now to designate it, Bethlem or Bethlehem Royal Hospital) at the\r\ntime of Henry VIII., and for long before and after that time. I have, I\r\nbelieve, consulted every important map of old London, and have found it\r\nno easy task to obtain a clear notion of the appearance of the building\r\nat that period. No print of the first hospital is in existence; at\r\nleast, I have never been able to find it, or met with any one who has\r\nseen it. I believe, however, that a good idea of the premises can be\r\nformed from a study of the map of London by Agas, made not very long\r\nafter the death of Henry VIII. (1560), and now in the Guildhall, where\r\nits careful examination has been facilitated by Mr. Overall, the\r\nLibrarian. From it I have represented an elevation of the hospital (see\r\nengraving), which will, I believe, convey a fairly correct notion of the\r\nextent and character of the premises. I am gratified to know that the\r\nreader will see as distinct a representation of the first Bethlem as can\r\nbe framed from the old maps--the real old Bedlam of Sir Thomas More, of\r\nTyndale, and Shakespeare. Shakespeare, I may here say, uses the word\r\nBedlam six times. It will be seen there is a rectangular area surrounded\r\nby buildings. In the centre is the church of the hospital. This was\r\ntaken down in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and other buildings erected\r\nin its place.\r\n\r\nThe oldest written description of any portion of the building which is\r\nextant mentions \"below stairs a parlour, a kitchen, two larders, a long\r\nentry [corridor] throughout the house, and twenty-one rooms wherein the\r\npoor distracted people lie; and above the stairs eight rooms more for\r\nservants and the poor to lie in.\"[66]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that there was a gate on the west side, and another\r\non the east.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE FIRST BETHLEM HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n_From Agas._] [_Page 60._]\r\n\r\nA map of ancient London was reconstructed, with great ingenuity and\r\nlabour, by the late Mr. Newton, 1855. But his reconstruction of Bethlem\r\nand its surroundings contains several inaccuracies which have been\r\navoided in the accompanying view. The church in the quadrangle differs\r\ncompletely from that given in Agas; and Newton fails to recognize the\r\ncharacter of the gate and its crenelated tower on the east side. There\r\nappear to have been, at the time of Agas, no buildings on the west side\r\nof the quadrangle, but in Braun and Hogenberg's or Stilliard's map,\r\nthere are houses not represented in the engraving. I must express my\r\ngreat obligation to Mr. J. E. Gardner, of London, as also to Mr. J. B.\r\nClark, for the assistance rendered me in this attempt to recover the\r\noutlines of the premises comprised under the true Old Bethlem.[67]\r\n\r\nEight years after the death of Henry VIII. (1555)--the second year of\r\nPhilip and Mary--it was ordered that the governors of Christ's Hospital\r\nshould be charged with the oversight and government of Bethlem, and\r\nreceive the account of rents, etc., instead of the City chamberlain; but\r\nthis arrangement lasted only a short time, for in September, 1557,\r\nanother change was made, and the management was transferred to the\r\ngovernors of Bridewell (which had been given to the City by Edward VI.\r\nin 1553), subject, of course, to the jurisdiction of the citizens. The\r\nsame treasurer was appointed for both. This union of the hospitals was\r\nconfirmed by the Act 22 Geo. III., c. 77, and continues, as is well\r\nknown, to the present day. It was not until this act passed that the\r\n_paramount_ authority of the City ceased, and the government now in\r\nforce was established, by which it was distinctly vested in a\r\npresident, treasurer, the Court of Aldermen, and the Common Council, and\r\nan unlimited number of governors, elected by ballot. So that now the\r\nonly sense in which Bethlem continues to belong to the City is that the\r\naldermen and common councilmen are _ex-officio_ governors. As there are\r\nat the present time upwards of two hundred governors, they are in a\r\ndecided minority.[68]\r\n\r\nTime was when Bethlem Hospital did not possess the magnificent income\r\nwhich she now enjoys. She knew, as we have seen, what poverty meant; and\r\neven if we make due allowance for the increased value of money we can\r\nhardly read without surprise that in 1555 the income from all the\r\npossessions of the hospital only amounted to L40 8s. 4d. Of course,\r\nconsiderable sums were collected as alms. Nearly a century after, the\r\nvaluation of real estates showed an annual value of L470. Several\r\nannuities had also been bequeathed, as that of Sir Thomas Gresham in\r\n1575, for \"the poor diseased in their minds in Bethlem.\"\r\n\r\nThe revenues, however, fell far short of the requirements of the\r\nhospital--namely, about two-thirds of the yearly charge--and at a court\r\nheld in 1642 preachers were directed to preach at the Spital of St.\r\nMary, in Bishopsgate Street, informing the public of the need of\r\npecuniary help, and exciting them to the exercise of charity.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1669 a deputation waited on the Lord Mayor to acquaint him\r\nwith the great cost of Bethlem, and to request that no patient should be\r\nsent until the president was informed, in order that he might fix on the\r\nweekly allowance, and obtain some security of payment.\r\n\r\nI need not say that since the period to which I refer, the income of\r\nBethlem Hospital has, in consequence of gifts, and the enormously\r\ngreater value of house property in London, been immensely increased, and\r\nthat what with its annuities, its stocks of various kinds, and its\r\nextensive estates, it is to-day in the position of doing, and without\r\ndoubt actually does, an immense amount of good.\r\n\r\nHalf a century after Henry VIII.'s death, Bethlem Hospital was reported\r\nto be so loathsome as to be unfit for any man to enter. There were then\r\ntwenty patients. I do not know, however, that any action was taken in\r\nconsequence. Thirty-four years afterwards (1632), I observe that the\r\nbuildings were enlarged, and mention is made of \"one messuage, newly\r\nbuilded of brick at the charge of the said hospital, containing a\r\ncellar, a kitchen, a hall, four chambers, and a garret, being newly\r\nadded unto the old rooms.\" Also, \"a long waste room now being contrived\r\nand in work, to make eight rooms more for poor people to lodge where\r\nthere lacked room before.\"[69]\r\n\r\nIn 1624, and I dare say at many other periods, the patients were so\r\nrefractory that it was necessary to call in the flax-dressers, whose\r\ntenter-boards may be seen in the adjoining field in the maps of London\r\nof this period, in order to assist the keepers in their duties!\r\n\r\nJust about the same date (1632) I notice that an inquisition mentions\r\nvarious sums being expended on fetters and straw. The governor at that\r\ntime, I should add, was a medical man. This is the first mention of such\r\nbeing the case. His name was Helkins or Hilkiah Crooke. He was born in\r\nSuffolk; graduated M.B. in 1599 and M.D. in 1604. He was a Fellow of the\r\nCollege of Physicians, and was author of \"A Description of the Body of\r\nMan,\" etc. (1616). There is in the second edition of this work a small\r\nwhole-length portrait by Droeshout.[70]\r\n\r\nTen years later (1642) there was a still further addition to Bethlem.\r\nTwelve rooms were built on the ground floor, over which there were eight\r\nfor lunatics. The hospital, however, only accommodated some fifty or\r\nsixty patients, and it is observed in \"Stow's Survey of London,\" that\r\nbesides being too small to receive a sufficient number of distracted\r\npersons of both sexes, it stood on an obscure and close place near to\r\nmany common sewers.\r\n\r\nThe hospital was one day visited by Evelyn. He had been dining with Lord\r\nHatton, and writes on returning: \"I stepped into Bedlam, where I saw\r\nseveral poor miserable creatures in chains; one of them was mad with\r\nmaking verses.\" This was on the 21st of April, 1657. Pepys does not\r\nrecord a single visit to it himself, but on February 21, 1668, he enters\r\nin his diary that \"the young people went to Bedlam.\"[71]\r\n\r\nSmith, in his \"Ancient Topography of London,\" says--and the authority\r\nfor most of his statements was Mr. Haslam[72]--\"The men and women in old\r\nBethlem were huddled together in the same ward.\" It was only when the\r\nsecond Bethlem was built that they had separate wards.\r\n\r\nIn Hollar's Map of London, engraved 1667, which gives the most distinct\r\nrepresentation of Bethlem Hospital at that period, there are no\r\nadditional buildings given, although we know they had been made. Nor are\r\nthose inserted which were built on the site of the church in the centre\r\nof the quadrangle.\r\n\r\nI have in the previous chapter spoken of Bedlam beggars, and would add\r\nhere that they are represented as wearing about their necks \"a great\r\nhorn of an ox in a string or bawdry, which when they came to an house\r\nfor alms, they did wind, and they did put the drink given them into\r\ntheir horn, whereto they did put a stopple.\" This description by\r\nAubrey[73] illustrates \"Poor Tom, thy horn is dry!\" in \"King Lear.\" So\r\nin Dekker's \"English Villanies\" (1648) the Abram-man is described as\r\nbegging thus: \"Good worship master! bestow you reward on a poor man who\r\nhath been in Bedlam without Bishopsgate three years, four months, and\r\nnine days, and bestow one piece of small silver towards his fees which\r\nhe is indebted there of L3 13s. 7-1/2d. (or to such effect), and hath\r\nnot wherewith to pay the same but by the help of worshipful and\r\nwell-disposed people, and God to reward them for it.\" \"Then,\" adds\r\nDekker, \"will he dance and sing, and use some other antic and ridiculous\r\ngestures, shutting up his counterfeit puppet play with this epilogue or\r\nconclusion--'Good dame, give poor Tom one cup of the best drink. God\r\nsave the king and his Council, and the governor of this place.'\"\r\n\r\nBedlam beggars were so great a nuisance, even in 1675, that the\r\ngovernors gave the following public notice:--\"Whereas several vagrant\r\npersons do wander about the City of London and Countries, pretending\r\nthemselves to be lunaticks, under cure in the Hospital of Bethlem\r\ncommonly called Bedlam, with brass plates about their arms, and\r\ninscriptions thereon. These are to give notice, that there is no such\r\nliberty given to any patients kept in the said Hospital for their cure,\r\nneither is any such plate as a distinction or mark put upon any lunatick\r\nduring their time of being there, or when discharged thence. And that\r\nthe same is a false pretence to colour their wandering and begging, and\r\nto deceive the people, to the dishonour of the government of that\r\nHospital.\"[74]\r\n\r\nI will now pass on to the close of the chapter of this the first Bethlem\r\nHospital, with the remark in passing that Charles I. confirmed the\r\ncharter of Henry VIII. in 1638,[75] and will direct attention to the\r\nyear 1674, when the old premises having become totally unfit for the\r\ncare--to say nothing of the treatment--of the inmates, it was decided to\r\nbuild another hospital. The City granted a piece of land on the north\r\nside of London Wall, extending from Moor Gate, seven hundred and forty\r\nfeet, to a postern opposite Winchester Street, and in breadth eighty\r\nfeet--the whole length of what is now the south side of Finsbury Circus.\r\nAt the present time the corner of London Wall and Finsbury Pavement,\r\nAlbion Hall, and the houses to the east, mark this spot, the grounds in\r\nfront of the hospital being, of course, situated in what is now Finsbury\r\nCircus.\r\n\r\nSmith's plates, in his \"Ancient London,\" show the back and west wing of\r\nthe asylum very well; and an elevation showing its front, which looked\r\nnorth towards what is now the London Institution, is represented in an\r\nengraving frequently met with in the print shops. Circus Place now runs\r\nthrough what was the centre of the building. The building, intended for\r\na hundred and twenty patients (but capable of holding a hundred and\r\nfifty), was commenced in April, 1675, and finished in July of the\r\nfollowing year, at a cost of L17,000. It was five hundred and forty feet\r\nlong by forty feet broad.\r\n\r\nOf this building, Gay wrote--\r\n\r\n    \"Through fam'd Moorfields, extends a spacious seat,\r\n     Where mortals of exalted wit retreat;\r\n     Where, wrapp'd in contemplation and in straw,\r\n     The wiser few from the mad world withdraw.\"\r\n\r\nEvelyn thus records his visit to the new hospital: \"1678, April 18. I\r\nwent to see New Bedlam Hospital, magnificently built, and most sweetly\r\nplaced in Moorfields since the dreadful fire in London.\"[76]\r\n\r\n\"Sweetly\" was not an appropriate term to use, as it proved, for it was\r\nbuilt on the ditch or sewer on the north side of London Wall, and this\r\ncircumstance led to the foundations ultimately proving insecure, not to\r\nsay unsavoury.\r\n\r\nAs the hospital was opened in 1676, it is noteworthy that it is now more\r\nthan two centuries since the first large asylum[77] was built for the\r\nsole object of providing for the insane in England. This is the building\r\nin Moorfields so familiar to our forefathers for nearly a century and a\r\nhalf, and known as Old Bethlem by print-dealers, and, indeed, by almost\r\nevery one else; for the memories and traditions of the genuine Old\r\nBethlem, which I have endeavoured to resuscitate, have almost faded\r\naway. Indeed, in 1815, when one of the physicians of the hospital (Dr.\r\nMonro) was asked, at the Select Committee of the House of Commons,\r\nwhether there had not been such a building, he replied that he did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nLet me bring before the reader the condition of Moorfields in those\r\ndays. Finsbury was so called from the fenny district in which it lay.\r\nSkating was largely practised here. In the old maps Finsbury fields lie\r\non the north-east side of Moorfields. Now Finsbury Circus and Square\r\ncorrespond to the site of a part of Moorfields. Formerly Moorfields\r\nextended up to Hoxton, \"but being one continued marsh, they were in 1511\r\nmade passable by proper bridges and causeways. Since that time the\r\nground has been gradually drained and raised.\"[78]\r\n\r\nIt was a favourite resort for archers. An association called the Archers\r\nof Finsbury was formed in King Edward I.'s time. There is an old book on\r\narchery, entitled \"Ayme for Finsbury Archers,\" 1628. An anonymous poem\r\nin blank verse, published in 1717, entitled \"Bethlem Hospital,\"\r\nattributed to John Rutter, M.A., contains the following lines, referring\r\nto the appropriation of the ground for drying clothes:--\r\n\r\n    \"Where for the City dames to blaunch their cloaths,\r\n     Some sober matron (so tradition says)\r\n     On families' affairs intent, concern'd,\r\n     At the dark hue of the then decent Ruff\r\n     From marshy or from moorish barren grounds,\r\n     Caused to be taken in, what now _Moorfields_,\r\n     Shaded by trees and pleasant walks laid out,\r\n     Is called, the name retaining to denote,\r\n     From what they were, how Time can alter things.\r\n     Here close adjoining, mournful to behold\r\n     The dismal habitation stands alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the description of the building given by Smith in his\r\n\"Ancient Topography of London\":--\"The principal entrance is from the\r\nnorth, of brick and freestone, adorned with four pilasters, a circular\r\npediment, and entablature of the Corinthian Order. The King's arms are\r\nin the pediment, and those of Sir William Turner above the front centre\r\nwindow.... It certainly conveys ideas of grandeur. Indeed it was for\r\nmany years the only building which looked like a palace[79] in London.\r\nBefore the front there is a spacious paved court, bounded by a pair of\r\nmassy iron gates, surmounted with the arms of the Hospital. These gates\r\nhang on two stone piers, composed of columns of the Ionic Order, on\r\neither side of which there is a small gate for common use. On the top of\r\neach pier was a recumbent figure, one of raving, the other of melancholy\r\nmadness, carved by Caius Gabriel Cibber. The feeling of this sculptor\r\nwas so acute, that it is said he would begin immediately to carve the\r\nsubject from the block, without any previous model, or even fixing any\r\npoints to guide him. I have often heard my father say that his master,\r\nRoubiliac, whenever city business called him thither, would always\r\nreturn by Bethlem, purposely to view these figures\" (p. 32).\r\n\r\nUnder an engraving of these figures, drawn by Stothard, are the lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"Bethlemii ad portas se tollit dupla columna;\r\n     #Heikona ton entos cho lithos ektos echei.#\r\n     Hic calvum ad dextram tristi caput ore reclinat,\r\n     Vix illum ad laevam ferrea vinc'la tenent.\r\n     Dissimilis furor est Statuis; sed utrumque laborem\r\n     Et genium artificis laudat uterque furor.\"\r\n\r\n                               _Lustus Westmonasteriensis._\r\n\r\nPope, in the \"Dunciad,\" thus spitefully refers to them in connection\r\nwith the sculptor's son, Colley Cibber, the comedian:--\r\n\r\n    \"Close to those walls where Folly holds her throne,\r\n     And laughs to think Monro would take her down,\r\n     Where o'er the gates by his famed father's hand\r\n     Great Cibber's brazen,[80] brainless brothers stand.\"\r\n\r\nNettled at being made the brother of two madmen, Cibber retaliated in a\r\nphilippic upon Pope, which it is said (with what truth I know not)\r\nhastened his death.[81] It was entitled \"A letter from Mr. Cibber to Mr.\r\nPope, wherein the New Hero's Preferment to his Throne in the 'Dunciad'\r\nseems not to be accepted, and the Author of that Poem His more rightful\r\nclaim to it is asserted.\r\n\r\n                ----'Remember Sauney's Fate,\r\n    Bang'd by the Blockhead whom he strove to beat.'\r\n\r\n                               _Parodie on Lord Roscommon._\r\n\r\nLondon, MDCCXLIV.\" And certainly Pope died a few months after, May,\r\n1744. It is, however, highly improbable that he would in the slightest\r\ndegree care for this letter, though he might suffer some remorse for his\r\nspiteful attack on so good-natured a fellow. Cibber says in this letter\r\nthat people \"allow that by this last stale and slow endeavour to maul\r\nme, you have fairly wrote yourself up to the Throne you have raised, for\r\nthe _immortal Dulness_ of your humble servant to nod in. I am therefore\r\nnow convinced that it would be ill-breeding in _Me_ to take _your_ seat,\r\nMr. Pope. Nay, pray, Sir, don't press me!... I am utterly conscious\r\nthat no Man has so good a Right to repose in it, as yourself. Therefore,\r\ndear, good good Mr. Pope, be seated!... Whether you call me Dunce or\r\nDoctor, whether you like me, or lick me, contemn, jerk, or praise me,\r\nyou will still find me the same merry Monarch I was before you did me\r\nthe Honour to put yourself out of Humour about me,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThese figures, now banished to South Kensington Museum, and there\r\nincarcerated at the top of the building, and only seen by special\r\npermission, are, of course, quite unsuitable for the entrance of the\r\nhospital, but I would plead for their being placed somewhere in Bethlem,\r\ntheir natural _habitat_. As works of art, the governors and officers\r\ncannot but be proud of them. I suppose, however, their banishment is\r\nintended as a public protest against the old system of treatment which\r\none of them exhibits, and from this point of view is no doubt\r\ncreditable. I would here observe that the figure of the maniac is\r\nsuperior to that of the melancholiac, whose expression is rather that of\r\ndementia than melancholia. I think that when Bacon, in 1820, repaired\r\nthis statue, he must have altered the mouth, because, in the engraving\r\nby Stothard, this feature, and perhaps others, are more expressive.\r\n\r\nAt Bethlem Hospital there were also certain gates called the \"penny\r\ngates,\" and on each side of them was a figure of a maniac--one a male,\r\nthe other a female. \"They are excellently carved in wood, nearly the\r\nsize of life, have frequently been painted in proper colours, and bear\r\nother evidence of age. It is reported they were brought from Old\r\nBethlem. In tablets over the niches in which they stand, is the\r\nfollowing supplication:--'_Pray remember the poor Lunaticks and put your\r\nCharity into the Box with your own hand._'\"[82]\r\n\r\nThere was a portrait of Henry VIII. in the hospital, which was also said\r\nto have been brought from the first Bethlem. A portrait is now in the\r\ncommittee-room of the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe \"penny gates\" refer, no doubt, to the custom of allowing Bethlem to\r\nbe one of the sights of the metropolis, the admission of any one being\r\nallowed for a penny, by which an annual income of at least L400 was\r\nrealized. The practice was discontinued in 1770. This amount is,\r\nhowever, probably exaggerated, as it is difficult to believe that 96,000\r\npersons visited the hospital in the course of the year. Ned Ward,\r\nhowever, from whom I shall shortly quote, says the fee was 2d. in his\r\ntime. If so, 48,000 may be about correct.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Rake's Progress,\" Hogarth represents two fashionable ladies\r\nvisiting this hospital as a show-place, while the poor Rake is being\r\nfettered by a keeper. The doctor, I suppose, is standing by. The\r\ndeserted woman who has followed him in his downward course to the\r\nhospital is by his side. The expression of the Rake has been said to be\r\na perfect representation of\r\n\r\n    \"Moody madness laughing wild, amid severest woe.\"\r\n\r\nA maniac lying on straw in one of the cells is a conspicuous figure.\r\nThere is a chain clearly visible.\r\n\r\nIn another cell is a man who believes himself a king, and wears a crown\r\nof straw.\r\n\r\nAn astronomer has made himself a roll of paper for a telescope, and\r\nimagines that he is looking at the heavens. The patient near him has\r\ndrawn on the wall the firing off a bomb, and a ship moored in the\r\ndistance. Ireland, in his notes on \"Hogarth,\" says it was to ridicule\r\nWhiston's project for the discovery of the longitude, which then\r\nattracted attention, and had sent some people crazy. Then there is a mad\r\nmusician with his music-book on his head; a sham pope; and a poor man on\r\nthe stairs \"crazed with care, and crossed by hopeless love,\" who has\r\nchalked \"Charming Betty Careless\" upon the wall. One figure looks like a\r\nwoman, holding a tape in her hands, but is intended for a tailor.[83]\r\n\r\nThere is in Mr. Gardner's collection a print representing the interior\r\nof one of the wards of Bethlem about the year 1745, when the hospital,\r\ntherefore, was in Moorfields. There are manacles on the arms of a\r\npatient who is lying on the floor, but there are none on the legs, as\r\nrepresented in Hogarth. With this interior, kindly placed at my disposal\r\nby Mr. Gardner, the reader can compare an interior of the existing\r\ninstitution, from a photograph, for the use of which I am indebted to\r\nthe present medical superintendent, Dr. Savage. The artist of the former\r\npicture has evidently aimed at giving as pleasant an impression as\r\npossible of the care bestowed on the inmates of Bethlem, but the\r\ncontrast is an interesting commentary on the past and present\r\nappearance of an asylum gallery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WARD IN BETHLEM HOSPITAL ABOUT 1745.\r\n\r\n_Print in Mr. Gardner's collection._] [_Page 74._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WARD IN BETHLEM HOSPITAL AT THE PRESENT DAY.\r\n\r\n_From a Photograph._] [_Page 74._]\r\n\r\nIn a poem bearing the title of \"Bedlam,\" and dated 1776, the writer,\r\nafter bestowing praise on the building, adds:--\r\n\r\n    \"Far other views than these within appear,\r\n     And Woe and Horror dwell for ever here;\r\n     For ever from the echoing roofs rebounds\r\n     A dreadful Din of heterogeneous sounds:\r\n     From this, from that, from every quarter rise\r\n     Loud shouts, and sullen groans, and doleful cries;\r\n           *      *      *      *      *\r\n     Within the chambers which this Dome contains,\r\n     In all her 'frantic' forms, Distraction reigns:\r\n           *      *      *      *      *\r\n     Rattling his chains, the wretch all raving lies,\r\n     And roars and foams, and Earth and Heaven defies.\"\r\n\r\nNed Ward, in his \"London Spy,\" gives a graphic account of his visit with\r\na friend to Bedlam:--\"Thus,\" he says, \"we prattled away our time, till\r\nwe came in sight of a noble pile of buildings, which diverted us from\r\nour former discourse, and gave my friend the occasion of asking me my\r\nthoughts of this magnificent edifice. I told him I conceived it to be my\r\nLord Mayor's palace, for I could not imagine so stately a structure to\r\nbe designed for any quality interior; he smiled at my innocent\r\nconjecture, and informed me this was Bedlam, an Hospital for mad folks.\r\nIn truth, said I, I think they were mad that built so costly a college\r\nfor such a crack-brained society; adding, it was a pity so fine a\r\nbuilding should not be possessed by such who had a sense of their\r\nhappiness: sure, said I, it was a mad age when this was raised, and the\r\nchief of the city were in great danger of losing their senses, so\r\ncontrived it the more noble for their own reception, or they would never\r\nhave flung away so much money to so foolish a purpose. You must\r\nconsider, says my friend, this stands upon the same foundation as the\r\nMonument, and the fortunes of a great many poor wretches lie buried in\r\nthis ostentatious piece of vanity; and this, like the other, is but a\r\nmonument of the City's shame and dishonour, instead of its glory; come,\r\nlet us take a walk in, and view its inside. Accordingly we were admitted\r\nin thro' an iron gate, within which sat a brawny Cerberus, of an\r\nIndico-colour, leaning upon a money-box; we turned in through another\r\nIron-Barricado, where we heard such a rattling of chains, drumming of\r\ndoors, ranting, hollowing, singing, and running, that I could think of\r\nnothing but Don Quevedo's Vision, where the lost souls broke loose and\r\nput Hell in an uproar. The first whimsey-headed wretch of this lunatic\r\nfamily that we observed, was a merry fellow in a straw cap, who was\r\ntalking to himself, 'that he had an army of Eagles at his command,' then\r\nclapping his hand upon his head, swore by his crown of moonshine, he\r\nwould battle all the Stars in the Skies, but he would have some\r\nclaret.... We then moved on till we found another remarkable figure\r\nworth our observing, who was peeping through his wicket, eating of bread\r\nand cheese, talking all the while like a carrier at his supper, chewing\r\nhis words with his victuals, all that he spoke being in praise of bread\r\nand cheese: 'bread was good with cheese, and cheese was good with bread,\r\nand bread and cheese was good together;' and abundance of such stuff;\r\nto which my friend and I, with others stood listening; at last he\r\ncounterfeits a sneeze, and shot such a mouthful of bread and cheese\r\namongst us, that every spectator had some share of his kindness, which\r\nmade us retreat.\"[84]\r\n\r\nMany other dialogues with the inmates of Bedlam are given, but they are\r\nevidently embellished, or altogether fictitious; true as I believe the\r\ndescription of the building and the uproar within to be.\r\n\r\nMr. Harvey, from his recollections of the hospital in Moorfields, in the\r\nearly part of this century, thus writes in 1863: \"When I remember\r\nMoorfields first, it was a large, open quadrangular space, shut in by\r\nthe Pavement to the west, the hospital and its outbuildings to the\r\nsouth, and lines of shops with fronts, occupied chiefly by dealers in\r\nold furniture, to the east and north. Most of these shops were covered\r\nin by screens of canvas or rough boards, so as to form an apology for a\r\npiazza; and if you were bold enough, in wet weather, you might take\r\nrefuge under them, but it was at the imminent risk of your purse or your\r\nhandkerchief. It was interesting to inspect the articles exposed for\r\nsale: here a cracked mirror in a dingy frame, a set of hair-seated\r\nchairs, the horse-hair protruding; a table, stiff, upright easy chairs,\r\nwithout a bottom, etc. These miscellaneous treasures were guarded by\r\nswarthy men and women of Israel, who paraded in front of their narrow\r\ndominions all the working day, and if you did but pause for an instant,\r\nyou must expect to be dragged into some hideous Babel of frowsy\r\nchattels, and made a purchaser in spite of yourself. Escaping from this\r\nuncomfortable mart to the hospital footway, a strange scene of utter\r\ndesertion came over you; long, gloomy lines of cells, strongly barred,\r\nand obscured with the accumulated dust, silent as the grave, unless\r\nfancy brought sounds of woe to your ears, rose before you; and there, on\r\neach side of the principal entrance, were the wonderful effigies of\r\nraving and moping madness, chiselled by the elder Cibber. How those\r\nstone faces and eyes glared! How sternly the razor must have swept over\r\nthose bare heads! How listless and dead were those limbs, bound with\r\ninexorable fetters, while the iron of despair had pierced the hearts of\r\nthe prisoned maniacs!\"[85]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1733 that two wings were added for incurable patients, but\r\nthis proved insufficient in the course of time; and in 1793 an adjoining\r\nplot of ground was obtained, and more accommodation provided. Only six\r\nyears later, however, surveyors appointed to inspect the premises\r\nreported that the hospital was dreary, low, melancholy, and not well\r\naired; and in 1804 the condition of the building was so dangerous that\r\nit was resolved to admit no more patients except those already\r\npetitioned for.[86] As the asylum had been built upon the ancient ditch\r\nof the city, a large portion of the foundation was insecure. Serious\r\nsettlements had taken place, and rendered it necessary to underpin the\r\nwalls.[87] When one looks at the palatial building represented in\r\nengravings, one feels some surprise to find it described as so low and\r\ndreary; but doubtless it was quite time to erect another asylum, and\r\nseek a better and more open site.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to enter upon the revelations made as to the internal\r\ncondition of Bethlem Hospital by the investigations of the Committee of\r\nthe House of Commons in 1815;[88] many are familiar with the prints\r\nexhibited at this Committee, of poor Norris who was secured by chains as\r\nthere represented, consisting of (1) a collar, encircling the neck, and\r\nconfined by a chain to a pole fixed at the head of the patient's bed;\r\n(2) an iron frame, the lower part of which encircled the body, and the\r\nupper part of which passed over the shoulders, having on either side\r\napertures for the arms, which encircled them above the elbow; (3) a\r\nchain passing from the ankle of the patient to the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\nAs to the treatment pursued at this time at Bethlem, the pith of it is\r\nexpressed in one sentence by Dr. T. Monro in his evidence before the\r\nCommittee. He had been visiting physician since 1783. \"Patients,\" he\r\nsays, \"are ordered to be bled about the latter end of May, according to\r\nthe weather; and after they have been bled, they take vomits, once a\r\nweek for a certain number of weeks; after that we purge the patients.\r\nThat has been the practice invariably for years long before my time; it\r\nwas handed down to me by my father, and I do not know any better\r\npractice.\" If in all this we are disposed to blame Bethlem, let us still\r\nmore condemn the lamentable ignorance and miserable medical red-tapism\r\nwhich marked the practice of lunacy in former times.\r\n\r\nI may here remark that, prior to the Monros, Dr. Thomas Allen[89] was,\r\nin 1679, visiting physician to Bethlem, and that, as I have observed\r\nalready, Helkins Crooke (1632) was the first medical man who is known to\r\nhave been at the head of this hospital. Dr. Tyson was physician from\r\n1684 to 1703. Mr. Haslam was appointed resident apothecary in 1795, and\r\nin 1815 gave evidence before the Committee of the House of Commons. At\r\nthat time he said there were a hundred and twenty-two patients; \"not\r\nhalf the number,\" he stated, \"which we used to have.\" For these there\r\nwere three male and two female keepers: the former assisting the latter\r\nwhen the female patients were refractory. Ten patients, he said, were at\r\nthat moment in chains, and we may be sure that the number was much\r\nlarger before public feeling had been aroused to demand investigation.\r\n\"The ultimatum of our restraint,\" said Mr. Haslam, \"is manacles, and a\r\nchain round the leg, or being chained by one arm; the strait waistcoat,\r\nfor the best of reasons, is never employed by us.\" Mr. Haslam, when\r\nasked whether a violent patient could be safely trusted when his fist\r\nand wrists were chained, replied, \"Then he would be an innoxious\r\nanimal.\" Patients, however, were frequently chained to the wall in\r\naddition to being manacled.\r\n\r\nA brief reference here to Dr. Allen and Dr. Tyson will not be out of\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"To his [Dr. Allen's] credit let it be recorded,\" says Dr. Munk, \"that\r\nhe refused to accede to a proposition which had met with general\r\napprobation at the Royal Society (of which he was himself a Fellow), to\r\nmake the first experiment of the transfusion of blood in this country\r\n'upon some mad person in Bedlam.'\" He died in 1684.\r\n\r\nDr. Edward Tyson, F.R.S., was the author of various works, but none on\r\nmental disease. His portrait is in the College. He died in 1708, aged\r\n58, and was buried in St. Dionys Backchurch, where there is a monument\r\nto his memory. He is the Carus of Garth's Dispensary.[90]\r\n\r\n    \"In his chill veins the sluggish puddle flows,\r\n     And loads with lazy fogs his sable brows;\r\n     Legions of lunaticks about him press,\r\n     His province is lost Reason to redress.\"\r\n\r\nOf the family whose hereditary connection with Bethlem is so remarkable,\r\nit should be chronicled that Dr. James Monro was elected physician to\r\nBethlem, 1728; he died 1752. His son describes him as \"a man of\r\nadmirable discernment, who treated insanity with an address that will\r\nnot soon be equalled.\" Dr. John Monro succeeded his father in this post.\r\n\"He limited his practice almost exclusively to insanity, and in the\r\ntreatment of that disease is said to have attained to greater eminence\r\nand success than any of his contemporaries. In January, 1783, while\r\nstill in full business, he was attacked with paralysis.... His vigour,\r\nboth of body and mind, began from that time to decline. In 1787 his son,\r\nDr. Thomas Monro, was appointed his assistant at Bethlem Hospital, and\r\nhe then gradually withdrew from business.\"[91] He died in 1791, aged 77.\r\nHe was the author of \"Remarks on Dr. Battie's Treatise on Madness,\r\n1758.\" Dr. Thomas Monro was appointed physician to Bethlem in 1792, and\r\nheld that office till 1816; he died 1833, aged 73. His son, Dr. Edward\r\nThomas Monro, succeeded him.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the close of the second Act in the drama of the Royal\r\nHospital of Bethlehem. The scene of Act the Third is laid in St.\r\nGeorge's Fields. The area of land covered about twelve acres. Provision\r\nwas made for two hundred patients. In 1810 an Act of Parliament was\r\nobtained (50 Geo. III., c. 198), by which the City was authorized to\r\ngrant the property to trustees for the governors of the hospital, for\r\nthe purpose of erecting a new one on an enlarged scale--on lease for\r\neight hundred and sixty-five years, at a yearly rent of 1s. The\r\nCorporation entered upon the spot occupied by the old hospital in\r\nMoorfields. The first stone was laid in St. George's Fields in April,\r\n1812, and it was opened August, 1815, consisting of a centre and two\r\nwings, the frontage extending five hundred and ninety-four feet. \"The\r\nformer has a portico, raised on a flight of steps, and composed of six\r\ncolumns of the Ionic order, surmounted by their entablature, and a\r\npediment in the tympanum on which is a relief of the Royal arms. The\r\nheight to apex is sixty feet.\" There is the following inscription:\r\n\r\n    \"HEN. VIII. REGE FUNDATUM. CIVIUM LARGITAS PERFECIT.\"\r\n\r\nThe funds were derived from the following sources:--\r\n\r\n                                              L       s.    d.\r\n\r\n  Grant from Parliament                     72,819    0     6\r\n\r\n  Benefactions from Public Bodies            5,405    0     0\r\n\r\n  Private Individuals                        5,709    0     0\r\n\r\n  Amount of Interest upon Balances in hand  14,873    4     8\r\n\r\n  Contributed from funds of Hospital        23,766    2     3\r\n                                          --------------------\r\n                                          L122,572    7     5\r\n\r\nEven in this new building, opened before the conclusion of the labours\r\nof the Select Committee of the House of Commons, 1815-16, the windows of\r\nthe patients' bedrooms were not glazed, nor were the latter warmed; the\r\nbasement gallery was miserably damp and cold; there was no provision for\r\nlighting the galleries by night, and their windows were so high from the\r\nground that the patients could not possibly see out, while the\r\nairing-courts were cheerless and much too small. Such was the\r\ndescription given by a keen observer, Sydney Smith, from personal\r\ninspection.[92]\r\n\r\nAdditional buildings were erected in 1838, the first stone being laid\r\nJuly 26th of that year, when a public breakfast was given at a cost of\r\nL464; and a narrative of the event at a cost of L140; a generous outlay\r\nof charitable funds! We may be quite sure that no one who breakfasted at\r\nBethlem on this occasion had any reason to be reminded of Sir Walter\r\nScott's observation in a letter dated March 16, 1831: \"I am tied by a\r\nstrict regimen to diet and hours, and, like the poor madman in Bedlam,\r\nmost of my food tastes of oatmeal porridge.\"\r\n\r\nOf the site of the third Bethlem Hospital a few words will suffice. The\r\nnotorious tavern called \"The Dog and Duck\" was here, and there is still\r\nto be seen in the wall to the right of the entrance to the hospital a\r\nrepresentation in stone of the dog, with the neck of a duck in its\r\nmouth. It bears the date of 1716. In Mr. Timbs' \"London\" it is misstated\r\n1617. Doubtless in olden time there was a pond here, for a duck hunt was\r\na common sport, and brought in much custom to the inn. After the Dog and\r\nDuck, this site was occupied by a blind school, pulled down in 1811.\r\n\r\nShakespeare makes the Duke of York say in \"Henry VI.\":--\r\n\r\n    \"Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;\r\n     Meet me to-morrow in Saint George's Fields.\"\r\n\r\n                               _2 Henry VI._, Act v. sc. 1.\r\n\r\nThe only other reference in Shakespeare to this locality indicates that\r\nin his time there was a Windmill Inn in St. George's Fields, for he\r\nmakes Shallow say to Falstaff--\r\n\r\n   \"O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night in the\r\n   Windmill, in Saint George's Fields?\"--_2 Henry IV._, Act iii.\r\n   sc. 2.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of Bethlem Royal Hospital; the considerable\r\nimprovements which succeeded the investigation; the inquiry and\r\nadmirable Report of the Charity Commissioners in 1837, from which it\r\nappears that at that time some of the patients were still chained, and\r\nthat the funds of Bethlem had been to no slight extent appropriated to\r\npersonal uses; its exemption from the official visitation of asylums\r\nrequired by the Act of Parliament passed in 1845 (8 and 9 Vict., c.\r\n100);[93] the unsatisfactory condition of the institution as revealed by\r\nthe investigations made in 1851 (June 28 to December 4); the placing of\r\nthe hospital in 1853 in the same position as regards inspection as other\r\ninstitutions for the insane (16 and 17 Vict., c. 96); the sweeping away\r\nof the old _regime_, and the introduction of a new order of things--the\r\ngreat lesson to be learned from this history being, as I think, the\r\nnecessity of having lunatic asylums open to periodical visitation--and\r\nlast, but not least, the establishment of a Convalescent Hospital at\r\nWitley within the last few years;--these important events I must content\r\nmyself with merely enumerating, but I cannot close this chapter without\r\nexpressing the satisfaction with which I regard the present management\r\nof the hospital, all the more striking when we recall some of the past\r\npages of its history; nor can I avoid congratulating the resident\r\nphysician and the other officers of the institution upon this result.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. LUKE'S HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing account of Bethlem Hospital it is necessary to add a\r\nbrief reference to that of St. Luke's, which, in consequence of the\r\ninsufficiency of Bethlem, was established in 1751, by voluntary\r\nsubscription, and was situated on the north side of Upper\r\nMoorfields,[94] opposite Bethlem Hospital, in a locality called Windmill\r\nHill, facing what is now Worship Street. It is stated that pupils were\r\nallowed to attend the hospital in 1753. It appears that Dr. Battie, the\r\nphysician to the hospital, who also had a private asylum, was the first\r\nin London to deliver lectures on mental diseases. He wrote \"A Treatise\r\non Madness,\" in 1758, and in this work censured the medical practice\r\npursued at Bethlem. He was warmly replied to by Dr. John Monro, in a\r\nbook entitled \"Remarks on Dr. Battie's 'Treatise on Madness.'\" His\r\n\"Aphorismi de Cognoscendis et Curandis Morbis nonnullis ad Principia\r\nAnimalia accommodati\" appeared in 1762. In 1763 he was examined before\r\nthe House of Commons as to the state of private mad-houses in England.\r\nIn April, 1764, he resigned, dying in 1776, from a paralytic stroke. His\r\ncharacter was described by Judge Hardinge, as follows:--\"Battius, faber\r\nfortunae suae, vir egregiae fortitudinis et perseverantiae, medicus\r\nperspicax, doctus et eruditus integritatis castissimae, fideique in\r\namicitiis perspectae.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Battie did not escape satire:--[95]\r\n\r\n    \"First Battus came, deep read in worldly art,\r\n     Whose tongue ne'er knew the secrets of his heart;\r\n     In mischief mighty, tho' but mean of size,\r\n     And like the Tempter, ever in disguise.\r\n     See him, with aspect grave and gentle tread,\r\n     By slow degrees approach the sickly bed;\r\n     Then at his Club behold him alter'd soon--\r\n     The solemn doctor turns a low Buffoon,\r\n     And he, who lately in a learned freak\r\n     Poach'd every Lexicon and publish'd Greek,\r\n     Still madly emulous of vulgar praise,\r\n     From Punch's forehead wrings the dirty bays.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Munk, to whose \"Roll of the Royal College of Physicians\" we are\r\nindebted for these particulars, adds, \"Eccentricity was strongly marked\r\nthroughout the whole of Dr. Battie's career; many strange and curious\r\nanecdotes concerning him are on record,\" and he quotes from Nichol's\r\n\"Literary Anecdotes\" (vol. i. p. 18, _et seq._) the following:--\"He was\r\nof eccentric habits, singular in his dress, sometimes appearing like a\r\nlabourer, and doing strange things. Notwithstanding his peculiarities,\r\nhe is to be looked upon as a man of learning, of benevolent spirit,\r\nhumour, inclination to satire, and considerable skill in his\r\nprofession.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1782 a new building was erected on a site formerly known as \"The\r\nBowling Green,\" where St. Luke's now stands, in Old Street. It cost\r\nL50,000, extended four hundred and ninety-three feet, and, although\r\nbuilt on the same plan as the former building, was a great improvement.\r\nIt was opened January 1, 1787; the patients, one hundred and ten in\r\nnumber, having been removed from the first hospital.\r\n\r\nElmes says, \"There are few buildings in the metropolis, perhaps in\r\nEurope, that, considering the poverty of the material, common English\r\nclamp-bricks, possess such harmony of proportion, with unity and\r\nappropriateness of style, as this building. It is as characteristic of\r\nits uses as that of Newgate, by the same architect\" (George Dance,\r\njun.).[96]\r\n\r\n\"Immediately behind this hospital is Peerless Pool, in name altered from\r\nthat of 'Perillous Pond,' so called, says old Stow, from the numbers of\r\nyouths who had been drowned in it in swimming.\" So writes Pennant in his\r\n\"London,\" and adds that \"in our time [1790] it has, at great expense,\r\nbeen converted into the finest and most spacious bathing-place now\r\nknown; where persons may enjoy this manly and useful exercise with\r\nsafety. Here is also an excellent covered bath, with a large pond\r\nstocked with fish, a small library, a bowling green, and every innocent\r\nand rational amusement; so that it is not without reason that the\r\nproprietor hath bestowed on it the present name.\"[97]\r\n\r\nSt. Luke's never got into ill repute like Bethlem. The investigation of\r\nthe House of Commons' Committee of 1815 did not reveal many abuses. If,\r\nhowever, its condition at that period were compared with the\r\nwell-managed institution of to-day, the result would be a very\r\ngratifying one. Thus, seventy years ago, the author of the \"Description\r\nof the Retreat,\" while preparing it, visited St. Luke's and discussed\r\nthe humane system of treatment of the insane with Mr. Dunstan, the\r\nsuperintendent, whom he considered desirous to do his duty to them,\r\nthough he thought that, having made some steps on the road to\r\nimprovement, he had become too much satisfied with himself, and that,\r\nhaving obtained a good character, he had become less solicitous about\r\nthe treatment, and inclined to suspect those who had gone a step beyond\r\nhim. \"He was for many years a valuable attendant at Bethlem, but it\r\nwould be very easy to advance many degrees from the practice of that\r\nestablishment, and yet be at an inconceivable distance from\r\nperfection.\"[98] Mr. Dunstan observed, \"You carry kind treatment too far\r\nat the Retreat--beyond safety. If you had many of our patients they\r\nwould turn you topsy-turvy presently.\" Mr. Tuke replied, \"It is\r\ncertainly possible to carry a good general principle too far, but we\r\nhave very few accidents or escapes, and we have many patients who come\r\nto us in a very violent state.\" Mr. Dunstan would not allow his visitor\r\nto see some of the rooms, and insisted that he could not have seen the\r\nworst cases at the Retreat when he visited it--\"for I have men in this\r\nplace who would tear to pieces every means of precaution or security\r\nwhich I saw there.\" The remainder of this manuscript of 1812 is worth\r\nreading by any one who knows the St. Luke's of 1882. \"There are three\r\nhundred patients, sexes about equal; number of women formerly much\r\ngreater than men; incurables about half the number. The superintendent\r\nhas never seen much advantage from the use of medicine, and relies\r\nchiefly on management. Thinks chains a preferable mode of restraint to\r\nstraps or the waistcoat in some violent cases. Says they have some\r\npatients who do not generally wear clothes. Thinks confinement or\r\nrestraint may be imposed as a _punishment_ with some advantage, and, on\r\nthe whole, thinks fear the most effectual principle by which to reduce\r\nthe insane to orderly conduct. _Instance:_ I observed a young woman\r\nchained by the arm to the wall in a small room with a large fire and\r\nseveral other patients, _for having run downstairs to the committee-room\r\ndoor_. The building has entirely the appearance of a place of\r\nconfinement, enclosed by high walls, and there are strong iron grates to\r\nthe windows. Many of the windows are not glazed, but have inner\r\nshutters, which are closed at night. On the whole, I think St. Luke's\r\nstands in need of a radical reform.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the infirmaries at each end of St. Luke's were fitted up for the\r\nreception of male and female patients. In 1842 a chaplain was appointed,\r\nand the present chapel set apart for worship. Open fireplaces were\r\nplaced in each of the galleries. The old method of coercion was\r\nabolished; padded rooms were made available for the treatment of the\r\nparoxysm; additional attendants were hired; and an airing-ground was\r\nlaid out and set apart for the use of the noisy and refractory patients.\r\nWooden doors were substituted for the iron gates of the galleries, and\r\nthe removal of the wire guards from the windows inside of the galleries\r\nadded much to their cheerfulness. The bars on the doors of the bedrooms,\r\nand the screens outside the windows of the galleries were also ordered\r\nto be removed. In 1843 the reading-rooms for the male and female\r\npatients were completed, and a library containing two hundred volumes\r\nwas supplied by the kindness of the treasurer; an amusement fund was\r\nestablished for the purchase of bagatelle and backgammon boards, and\r\nother games for the use of the patients. In 1845 the hospital came under\r\nthe provisions of the Lunacy Act (8 and 9 Vict., c. 100). Since the\r\nLunacy Act of that year, the affairs of the hospital have been subjected\r\nto the control of the Commissioners, in addition to that of the House\r\nCommittee and Board of Governors. Gas was introduced in 1848 into the\r\nhospital. In 1849 the pauper burial-ground at the back of the hospital\r\nwas closed.[99] Numerous improvements have been made in recent years,\r\nespecially in regard to the appearance of the galleries. The next\r\nimprovement will be, I hope, to build a third St. Luke's, in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] Dugdale's \"Monasticon,\" vol. vi. pt. ii. pp. 621, 622. Rot.

Thus, there was in London an\r\nold manor house in Clerkenwell, previously the residence of the\r\nNorthampton family, which was converted into a private asylum by Dr.\r\nNewton the herbalist. His work, \"The Herbal,\" was published by his son\r\nsome years afterwards. There appeared in the _Post Boy_ (No. 741) in the\r\nyear 1700 an advertisement from Dr. Newton, which runs as follows:--\"In\r\nClerkenwell Close, where the figures of Mad People are over the Gate,\r\nliveth one who by the blessing of God cures all Lunatick, distracted, or\r\nmad people; he seldom exceeds three months in the cure of the Maddest\r\nperson that comes in his house; several have been cured in a fortnight\r\nand some in less time; he has cured several from Bedlam, and other\r\nmad-houses in and about the city, and has conveniency for people of\r\nwhat quality soever. No cure--No money.\"\r\n\r\nA certain Dr. Fallowes published a work on insanity which attracted some\r\nattention at this period, having for its title, \"The Best Method for the\r\nCure of Lunatics, with some Accounts of the Incomparable Oleum\r\nCephalicum used in the same, prepared and administered.\"[100] The author\r\nobserves in his preface that \"as this Kingdom perhaps most abounds with\r\nlunaticks, so the greatest variety of distractions are to be seen among\r\nus; for the spleen to which it has been observed this nation is\r\nextremely subject, often rises up to very enormous degrees, and what we\r\ncall _Hypo_ often issues in Melancholy, and sometimes in Raving\r\nMadness.\" The proper seat of madness, he adds, appears to be the brain,\r\n\"which is disturbed by black vapours which clog the finer vessels thro'\r\nwhich the animal spirits ought freely to pass, and the whole mass of\r\nblood, being disordered, either overloads the small veins of the brain,\r\nor by too quick a motion, causes a hurry and confusion of the mind, from\r\nwhich ensues a giddiness and at length a fury. The abundance of bile,\r\nwhich is rarely found to have any tolerable secretion in such patients,\r\nboth begets and carries on the disorder.\" Again, it will be seen that\r\nthere is nothing more than the fashionable classic humoral pathology,\r\nwithout any original observations, and, in fact, the book is little more\r\nthan a puff of his incomparable oleum cephalicum, \"a noble medicine,\"\r\nwhich he professes to have discovered; \"a composition so very curious,\r\nwhich I have known the use and benefit of in so many instances, that I\r\ncan venture to assure it to be the best medicine in the world in all the\r\nkinds of lunacy I have met with. It is of an excellent and most pleasant\r\nsmell, and by raising small pustules upon the head, which I always\r\nanoint with it, opens the parts which are condensed and made almost\r\ninsensible by the black vapours fixed upon the brain; it confirms its\r\ntexture, strengthens the vessels, and gives a freedom to the blood and\r\nspirit enclosing them.... When applied after the greatest fury and\r\npassion, it never fails to allay the orgasm of the animal spirits, and\r\nsweetly compose 'em.... The distemper will be soon discharged, and I\r\nhave known it frequently to produce a cure in the space of one month.\"\r\nHe tells the reader he has had L10 a quart for it, but in compassion for\r\nthe poor he has prepared a quantity to be sold at L4 a quart at his\r\nhouse. He also boasts of his kind treatment, and says, \"The rough and\r\ncruel treatment which is said to be the method of most of the pretenders\r\nto this cure, is not only to be abhorred, but, on the contrary, all the\r\ngentleness and kindness in the world is absolutely necessary, even in\r\nall the cases I have seen.\" He says that not only has he never used\r\nviolence, but that his patients have good and wholesome food in every\r\nvariety, and maintains that such entertainments as are fit for persons\r\nof any degree or quality will be found in his house in Lambeth Marsh,\r\n\"where the air is neither too settled and thin, nor too gross.\" As\r\nchalybeate waters and cold bathing are useful, they can be had near, at\r\nthe Lambeth waters and in the Southwark Park; and he closes his book by\r\ndeclaring that he is \"always ready to serve mankind upon such terms as\r\nshall be acknowledged reasonable and proportioned to the character and\r\ncondition of every patient.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the patients placed under his care were treated as\r\nscientifically and kindly as at the well-known asylum now in Lambeth\r\nRoad does not admit of question, although the latter has not much to say\r\nof the \"black vapours fixed upon the brain,\" nor can it, I am afraid,\r\nboast of such a panacea as the oleum cephalicum!\r\n\r\nI may add that, contemporary with Dr. Fallowes, an anonymous physician\r\nin London published \"A Discourse of the Nature, Cause, and Cure of\r\nMelancholy and Vapours,\" in which he prescribes for the former, among\r\nother remedies, not only \"salt armoniac\" (_sic_), steel filings, red\r\ncoral, zedoary, xyloalics, but, strangest of all, _toasted silk_!\r\n\r\nHad we no other means of knowing the treatment to which some at least of\r\nthe insane were subjected in the early part of the eighteenth century,\r\nwe might infer it from a single passage in Swift's \"Tale of a Tub,\" in\r\nwhich the author says, in a \"Digression concerning Madness,\" that\r\noriginal people, like Diogenes, would, had they lived in his day, be\r\ntreated like madmen, that is, would incur the danger of \"phlebotomy, and\r\nwhips, and chains, and dark chambers, and straw.\"\r\n\r\nThis was written in 1704.\r\n\r\nAnother well-known writer of that period, Smollett, did not distinguish\r\nhimself for generous views in regard to the insane, and forms a complete\r\ncontrast to his contemporary, Defoe, in his ideas of what the\r\nlegislature ought to do for the insane--a contrast greatly to the credit\r\nof the latter. Smollett thought it would be neither absurd nor\r\nunreasonable for the legislature to divest all lunatics of the privilege\r\nof insanity in cases of enormity--by which he evidently means violent or\r\nhomicidal acts--to subject them \"to the common penalties of the law.\" He\r\nmaintains that the consequences of murder by a maniac may be as\r\npernicious to society as those of the most criminal and deliberate\r\nassassination. The entire inability indicated by this sentiment to\r\ndistinguish between voluntary and involuntary acts, the result of\r\ndisease--between motives and consequences--is singularly well shown.\r\nUnfortunately it was not peculiar to Smollett.\r\n\r\nEloquently did Daniel Defoe protest against the abuses of asylums in his\r\nday.[101] The \"True-Born Englishman\" reprobates the practice of men\r\nsending their wives to mad-houses at every whim or dislike, in order\r\nthat they might be undisturbed in their evil ways. He asserts that this\r\ncustom had got to such a head that the private mad-houses were greatly\r\non the increase in and near London. He might well characterize this\r\nsystem as \"the height of barbarity and injustice,\" and worse than \"a\r\nclandestine inquisition,\" and say that these houses, if not suppressed,\r\nshould at least be subjected to examination. \"Is it not enough,\" he\r\nasks, \"to make any one mad to be suddenly clapped up, stripped, whipped,\r\nill fed, and worse used?\" He says, \"If this tyrannical inquisition,\r\njoined with the reasonable reflections a woman of any common\r\nunderstanding must necessarily make, be not sufficient to drive any soul\r\nstark-staring mad, though before they were never so much in their right\r\nsenses, I have no more to say.\" He asks the reader to indulge for once\r\nthe doting of an old man while he lays down his remedy, and not to\r\ncharge him with the ambition to be a lawgiver. Defoe goes at once to the\r\npoint, and says that it should be no less than felony to confine any\r\nperson, under pretence of madness, without due authority. He calls upon\r\nQueen Caroline to begin her auspicious reign with an action worthy of\r\nherself. Addressing the ladies, he says, \"Who can deny when you become\r\nsuitors? and who knows but at your request a Bill may be brought into\r\nthe House to regulate these abuses?\" Defoe little knew the prejudice any\r\nreasonable measure would arouse when he added, \"I am sure no honest\r\nmember in either honourable House will be against so reasonable a Bill;\r\nthe business is for some public-spirited patriot to break the ice by\r\nbringing it into the House, and I dare lay my life it passes.\" He would\r\nhave infallibly lost it.\r\n\r\nThis naturally brings us to the question of what has been done by\r\nlegislation, both for protecting the subject from being unjustly\r\nincarcerated on the plea of insanity, and for the protection of lunatics\r\nwhen confined in asylums. The only Act of Parliament, up to the year\r\n1808, which bore upon the care and protection of the lunatic poor was\r\nthat passed in the year 1744, in the seventeenth year of George II. (17\r\nGeo. II., c. 5). This authorizes any two justices to apprehend them, and\r\nhave them securely locked up and, as might be expected, chained. The\r\ncontrast between the spirit and the provisions of such an Act, and that\r\npassed a century later, under the auspices of Lord Shaftesbury, brings\r\ninto strong relief the solid advance which has been made in a century,\r\nin the face of constant opposition from interested persons, as well as\r\nthat which arises out of the mere apathy and lethargy of a large class\r\nof the community.\r\n\r\nIt should be added, in justice to the framers of the Act of 1744, that\r\nit refers to those who \"are so far disordered in their senses that they\r\nmay be too dangerous to be permitted to go abroad.\" It is rather for the\r\nprotection of society than the care of the lunatic.\r\n\r\nA Committee of the House of Commons was appointed in 1763, to inquire\r\ninto the state of the private mad-houses of the kingdom. On this\r\nCommittee sat Pitt and Fox,[102] Wilkes, Lord North, Mr. Grenville, and\r\nMr. T. Townshend--names which alone serve to secure one's interest, and\r\nalso to raise the expectation that something would be done. Their\r\nReport, while evidently drawn up in a cautious manner, shows, as had\r\nbeen insisted upon by Daniel Defoe, with what alarming facility the\r\nliberty of the subject could be taken away on the plea of insanity, and\r\nhow frequently persons availed themselves of this facility in order to\r\nget rid of a troublesome wife or daughter, or to obtain some selfish\r\nobject equally improper. Dr. Battie[103] gave it as his opinion that\r\nsane persons were frequently confined in asylums, and mentioned a case\r\nin which a gentleman, who had had his wife immured in one, justified\r\nhimself by saying that he understood the house to be a sort of\r\nBridewell, or place of correction. The same witness found one patient in\r\nan asylum, who had been there for years, chained to his bed, without\r\never having had the assistance of any physician before. He never heard\r\nanything more of him, until he was told some time after that he had died\r\nof fever, without having had further medical advice.\r\n\r\nThe Committee resolved, \"That it is the opinion of this Committee that\r\nthe present state of the private mad-houses in this Kingdom requires the\r\ninterposition of the legislature.\"\r\n\r\nThe Resolution was agreed to by the House, and leave was given to bring\r\nin a Bill for the Regulation of Private Mad-houses, its preparation\r\nbeing left to Mr. Townshend and six other members of the House.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, no legislation followed the Report of this Committee; in\r\nfact, no further action was taken for ten long years.\r\n\r\nTwo years after this Committee sat, a melancholy picture of the\r\ncondition of private asylums in England is given in the _Gentleman's\r\nMagazine_, and we can well believe that it was not over-coloured when we\r\nconsider the evidence which had been given before the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe writer asserts that persons may be and are taken forcibly to these\r\nhouses without any authority, instantly seized by a set of inhuman\r\nruffians trained up to this barbarous profession, stripped naked, and\r\nconveyed to a dark room. If the patient complains, the attendant\r\nbrutishly orders him not to rave, calls for assistants, and ties him\r\ndown to a bed, from which he is not released till he submits to their\r\npleasure. Next morning a doctor is gravely introduced, who, taking the\r\nreport of the keeper, pronounces the unfortunate person a lunatic, and\r\ndeclares he must be reduced by physic. He is deprived of all\r\ncommunication with the outer world, and denied the use of pen and paper.\r\nSuch usage, the writer goes on to say, without a formal warrant, is too\r\nmuch even for the Inquisition in Spain or Portugal, and cries aloud for\r\nredress in a land of liberty. One circumstance brought forcibly out is\r\nsimilar to that which, occurring at York some years afterwards (1791),\r\nled, as we shall see, to the foundation of an institution in which a\r\ndirectly opposite course was pursued. \"Patients,\" he says, \"often cannot\r\nbe found out, because the master lets them bear some fictitious names in\r\nthe house; and if fortunately discovered by a friend, the master, or his\r\nservants, will endeavour to elude his search and defeat his humane\r\nintentions by saying _they have strict orders to permit no person to see\r\nthe patient_.\"\r\n\r\nAt an earlier period a lady was sent by her husband to a private asylum\r\nsimply because she was extravagant and dissipated. The account of this\r\naffair is in manuscript, dated 1746, but the substance of it is given\r\nby a gentleman in _Notes and Queries_, May 5, 1866. Two or three girls\r\nwere placed in the same house, in order to break off love affairs\r\ndisapproved by their friends.\r\n\r\nAgain, I observe the following entry in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ under\r\ndate Sunday, August 6, 1769:--\"A gentleman near Whitehall, by the\r\nassistance of four ruffians, forced his lady into a hackney coach, and\r\nordered the coachman to drive to a private mad-house, and there to be\r\nconfined.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Gentleman's Magazine_ writer's remedy for \"a condition compared\r\nwith which none is so deeply calamitous; no distress so truly miserable;\r\nno object so deserving of compassion, and none so worthy of redress,\"\r\nwas a really effective Bill for the regulation of private mad-houses.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1773, a Bill passed the Commons for the \"Regulation of\r\nPrivate Mad-houses,\" the Report of 1763 having been first read. But\r\nagain disappointment awaited this honest attempt to protect the insane\r\nand those alleged to be insane. The Bill was thrown out, as too many\r\ngood Bills have been thrown out, by the House of Lords. One is reminded\r\nof the saying of Daniel O'Connell, \"If it took twenty years to do\r\nnothing, how long would it take to do anything?\" In the House of\r\nCommons, Mr. Townshend said in the debate that facts had come to his\r\nknowledge which would awaken the compassion of the most callous heart.\r\nMr. Mackworth said that the scenes of distress lay hid indeed in obscure\r\ncorners, but he was convinced that if gentlemen were once to see them,\r\nthey would not rest a day until a Bill for their relief was passed, and\r\nprotested that he would mind neither time nor trouble, but employ every\r\nhour until some relief should be obtained. He asserted, as also did Mr.\r\nTownshend, that it was the \"gentlemen of the long robe\" who prevented\r\nany action being taken. Be this as it may, the Bill, as I have said, was\r\nthrown out, while another,[104] which proved almost a dead letter, was\r\npassed in the following year. It was required by this Act that licences\r\nshould be granted \"to all persons who shall desire the same.\" Reports of\r\nabuses were to be made to the College of Physicians, to be suspended in\r\nthe College for perusal \"by whosoever should apply for that purpose;\"\r\nbut the College had no power to punish delinquents. This Act is\r\ncharacterized by the Commissioners in Lunacy as \"utterly useless in\r\nregard to private patients, though in terms directing visitations to be\r\nmade to lunatics,\" and as they observe, its provisions \"did not even\r\napply to the lunatic poor, who were sent to asylums without any\r\nauthority except that of their parish officers.\" Its scope did not\r\nextend beyond private mad-houses. For admission into these an order and\r\nmedical certificate were necessary. They were sent to the secretary of\r\nthe Commissioners, that is, five Fellows of the College appointed in\r\naccordance with the Act. They did not license or inspect the provincial\r\nprivate asylums, but these were directed to send copies of the order and\r\ncertificate to the Fellows.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, perhaps, that nothing was done all these years,\r\nconsidering how many questions engrossed the public mind. These\r\ncomprised the exciting debates and the popular tumults connected with\r\nWilkes and Horne Tooke, the heated discussions on the question of the\r\nfreedom of reporting debates in Parliament, and the \"Royal Marriage\r\nBill.\" Lord Clive and Warren Hastings were engaged in deeds in India\r\nwhich were about to bring down upon them the philippics of Burke and Sir\r\nPhilip Francis--much more attractive than the carrying of a Lunatic Bill\r\nthrough Parliament. And, above all, the struggle had commenced, though\r\nblood had not been spilt, between this country and her American\r\ncolonies. Then again, there was the distraction caused by the remarkable\r\nmental affection of the Earl of Chatham, on which it will be fitting,\r\nand I think interesting, to dwell for a moment. He had become Prime\r\nMinister in 1766, and the following year was attacked by his remorseless\r\nenemy, the gout. Partially recovered, he returned to Parliament--so\r\npartially, indeed, that he was \"scarce able to move hand or foot.\"\r\nEngaged in making certain changes in the ministry, he began (to employ\r\nthe descriptive language of Trevelyan[105]) \"to be afflicted by a\r\nstrange and mysterious malady. His nerves failed him. He became wholly\r\nunequal to the transaction of any public affairs, and secluding himself\r\nin his own house, he would admit no visitors and open no papers on\r\nbusiness. In vain did his most trusted colleagues sue to him for one\r\nhour's conversation. As the spring advanced, he retired to a house at\r\nHampstead, and was able at intervals to take the air upon the heath,\r\nbut was still at all times inaccessible to all his friends.\" His\r\nbrother-in-law, Mr. Grenville, wrote:[106] \"Lord Chatham's state of\r\nhealth is certainly the lowest dejection and debility that mind or body\r\ncan be in. He sits all the day leaning on his hands, which he supports\r\non the table; does not permit any person to remain in the room; knocks\r\nwhen he wants anything; and, having made his wants known, gives a signal\r\nwithout speaking to the person who answered his call to retire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Other accounts of a rather later period,\" says Lord Mahon, \"state that\r\nthe very few who ever had access to him found him sedate and calm, and\r\nalmost cheerful, until any mention was made of politics, when he\r\nstarted, trembled violently from head to foot, and abruptly broke off\r\nthe conversation. During many months there is no trace in his\r\ncorrespondence of any letter from him, beyond a few lines at rare\r\nintervals and on pressing occasions, which he dictated to his wife. Even\r\nhis own small affairs grew a burden too heavy for his enfeebled mind to\r\nbear. He desired Mr. Nuthall, as his legal adviser, to make ready for\r\nhis signature a general power of attorney, drawn up in the fullest\r\nterms, and enabling Lady Chatham to transact all business for him\r\n(Chatham Correspondence, vol. iii. p. 282, August 17, 1767). At the\r\nclose of the summer he was removed from Hampstead to Burton Pynsent, and\r\nthence to Bath, some benefit to his health being looked for from the\r\nchange. But all his own thoughts and wishes at this time were centred\r\nin the purchase of Hayes. In that air he had enjoyed good health; in\r\nthat air he might enjoy it again. There, in former years, he had made\r\nimprovements which his memory fondly recalled--plantations, for example,\r\npursued with so much ardour and eagerness that they were not even\r\ninterrupted at nightfall, but were continued by torchlight and with\r\nrelays of labourers. To Hayes, again become his property, Lord Chatham\r\nwas removed in December, 1767. But there, during many months ensuing, he\r\ncontinued to languish in utter seclusion, and with no improvement to his\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\"It is scarcely to be wondered at that a malady thus mysterious and thus\r\nlong protracted should have given rise to a suspicion in some quarters\r\nthat it was feigned or simulated, with a view to escape the vexations or\r\navoid the responsibilities of office. This idea, however natural, was\r\ncertainly quite unfounded. But, on the other hand, we may not less\r\ndecisively discard the allegation of gout.... In truth, it was not gout,\r\nbut the absence of gout, which at this period weighed upon Lord Chatham.\r\nOn the 2nd of March he had arrived in London from Marlborough, still\r\nlame, and no more than half recovered. There his new physician, Dr.\r\nAddington, eager, no doubt, to restore him to his public duties with the\r\nleast delay, had rashly administered some strong remedies, which did\r\nindeed dispel the gout from his limbs, but only to scatter it about his\r\nbody, and especially upon his nerves. This fact was discovered, and has\r\nbeen recorded by two separate and equally shrewd observers at the time\r\n(Lord Chesterfield to his son, December 19, 1767; Lord Orford,\r\n'Memoirs,' ii. p. 451[107]). Hence arose the dismal and complete eclipse\r\nwhich for upwards of a year his mental powers suffered. There was no\r\nmorbid illusion of the fancy, but there was utter prostration of the\r\nintellect.... In September, 1767, Junius spoke of Lord Chatham as 'a\r\n_lunatic_ brandishing a crutch.'\"[108]\r\n\r\n\"In the autumn Lord Chatham's health grew stronger. Judging from the\r\nevent, we may conclude that the morbid humours had begun to leave his\r\nnerves, and to concentrate for a fit--so long intermitted and so much\r\nneeded--of his hereditary gout. He was still entirely shut out from his\r\nfriends, and still unable to transact any business, but he could bear to\r\nhear it mentioned, and could form some judgment of its tenor. In this\r\nsituation his mind, not yet restored to its full vigour, brooded over\r\nsuspicions and discontents, for which the behaviour of his colleagues\r\nafforded him no just foundation.\"[109]\r\n\r\nLord Chatham now resigned the Privy Seal (October, 1768), which he had\r\nheld since July, 1766. \"Until towards the middle of March, 1767, he had\r\nbeen truly and in effect Prime Minister; since that time he had\r\nbeen--_nothing_.\"\r\n\r\nLord Chatham's derangement was, however, at last dispelled. We find\r\nthat \"a few weeks only after Lord Chatham's resignation, his gout, so\r\nlong interrupted, but for some time past giving symptoms of approach,\r\nreturned. Bowed down as he was by a far more grievous malady, it proved\r\nto him a healing visitation. It raised his drooping spirits and strung\r\nhis feeble nerves. The clouds which had obscured that great intellect\r\nwholly passed away. Never indeed did his splendid eloquence or his wise\r\nand resolute counsels shine forth more brightly than during the next\r\nfollowing years.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1775 (November 29) that, on the American war\r\nquestion, Lord Chatham emerged from his retirement--a year after the\r\nLunacy Act had passed.\r\n\r\nThirteen years later, his Sovereign fell a victim to the same disorder,\r\nand it is probable that the attention thus drawn to the malady exerted a\r\nbeneficial influence upon public feeling, in the interests of those\r\nlabouring under the same affliction. The clerical and medical doctor,\r\nWillis, who was at that time seventy years of age, was called in to\r\nattend George III. in 1788. The King had had, as early as 1765, a slight\r\nattack, but the fact was carefully concealed. Willis's treatment\r\nconsisted in bark, blistering, and an occasional dose of calomel.[110]\r\nIt is not necessary to enter here into the differences of opinion which\r\narose as to the conduct of the case, between himself and his colleagues,\r\nWarren, Reynolds, and others. In February, 1789, the royal patient had\r\nprogressed so favourably that he was able to write a sensible letter to\r\nPitt, and on April 23rd of the same year he went to St. Paul's to offer\r\nthanks for his recovery, amid a vast and enthusiastic multitude, thereby\r\nrunning a great risk of a relapse. However, he had no return of the\r\ncomplaint till 1801, when he recovered rapidly. In 1804 he again became\r\ninsane, and again recovered, the death of the Princess Amelia in 1810\r\ncausing the attack from which he never recovered. The subject of\r\ninsanity was therefore brought before the public again and again, for\r\nsome thirty years--longer, indeed, if we include Lord Chatham's\r\nderangement--and brought before them in a way which excited their\r\ncommiseration in a marked degree.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that mechanical restraint was applied by Willis\r\nto the King. \"Nothing,\" observes the late Dr. Ray, \"can more strikingly\r\nindicate the change that has occurred since that time in respect to the\r\nmeans of managing the insane, than the fact that for two or three months\r\nthe King was frequently subjected to mechanical restraint. There was\r\nnothing in his condition which could be considered at the present time a\r\nsufficient reason for its application.\"[111]\r\n\r\nIt may be observed here that John Wesley prescribed at this period for\r\nmadness, as well as for irreligion.[112] One of his remedies was that\r\nthe patient should be exclusively fed on apples for a month--a regimen\r\nwhich recalls the starving treatment of epilepsy prescribed, at a\r\nrecent date, by Dr. Jackson, of Boston. Wesley's prescriptions for\r\n\"lunacy\" and \"raving madness\" are given with almost as much confidence\r\nof success as those we have cited from the Saxon leech-book.\r\n\r\n    \"For Lunacy:\r\n\r\n    1. Give decoction of agrimony four times a day.\r\n\r\n    2. Or, rub the head several times a day with vinegar in which\r\n    ground ivy leaves have been infused.\r\n\r\n    3. Or, take daily an ounce of distilled vinegar.\r\n\r\n    4. Or, boil juice of ground ivy with sweet oil and white wine\r\n    into an ointment. Shave the head anointed therewith, and\r\n    chafe it in, warm, every other day for three weeks; bruise\r\n    also the leaves and bind them on the head, and give three\r\n    spoonfuls of the juice warm every morning.\r\n\r\n    This generally cures melancholy. The juice alone taken twice\r\n    a day will cure.\r\n\r\n    5. Or, electrify. Tried.\r\n\r\n    For Raving Madness:\r\n\r\n    1. It is a sure rule that all madmen are cowards, and may be\r\n    conquered by binding only, without beating (Dr. Mead). He\r\n    also observes that blistering the head does more harm than\r\n    good. Keep the head close shaved, and frequently wash it with\r\n    vinegar.\r\n\r\n    2. Apply to the head clothes dipt in cold water.\r\n\r\n    3. Or, set the patient with his head under a great waterfall,\r\n    as long as his strength will bear; or pour water on his head\r\n    out of a tea-kettle.\r\n\r\n    4. Or, let him eat nothing but apples for a month.\r\n\r\n    5. Or, nothing but bread and milk. Tried.\"\r\n\r\nIn all hypochondriacal cases, and in obstinate madness, Wesley\r\nrecommended the following, wherein we see a return to the almost\r\ninevitable hellebore: \"Pour twelve ounces of rectified spirits of wine\r\non four ounces of roots of black hellebore, and let it stand in a warm\r\nplace twenty-four hours. Pour it off and take from thirty to forty drops\r\nin any liquid, fasting.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, for all nervous disorders, he recurs to what was his favourite\r\nremedy, and says, \"But I am firmly persuaded that there is no remedy in\r\nnature for nervous disorders of every kind, comparable to the proper\r\nand constant use of the electrical machine.\"\r\n\r\nI would direct the reader's attention to the condition of some asylums\r\nat the latter end of the eighteenth century, as described by a prominent\r\ncharacter and noble philanthropist of that period.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated John Howard did not confine his attention to prisons, but\r\nfrequently took occasion to visit asylums in the course of his\r\nphilanthropic travels; and in his \"Accounts of the Principal Lazarettos\r\nin Europe, together with Further Observations on some Foreign Prisons\r\nand Hospitals, and Additional Remarks on the Present State of those in\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland\" (1789), he contrasts St. Luke's Hospital with\r\na hospital for lunatics at Constantinople, to the advantage of the\r\nlatter in some respects, although he states that there is very little\r\nregard paid to cleanliness or the patients, while the former was neat\r\nand clean. Of the Constantinople asylums, he says, \"They are admirable\r\nstructures.... The rooms are all on the ground floor, arched, and very\r\nlofty, having opposite windows, and opening under a corridor into a\r\nspacious area.\" In the midst of the neglect of _human_ beings he was\r\nastonished to find so much attention paid to _cats_, an asylum having\r\nbeen provided for them near the Mosque of St. Sophia. Of St. Luke's he\r\nsays, \"The cells were very clean and not offensive. The boxes on which\r\nthe beds of straw lie are on a declivity and have false bottoms. The\r\ncells open into galleries, fifteen feet wide, and on each gallery was a\r\nvault, which was not offensive.... Here are large airing grounds for\r\nmen and women; there is also a new but very inconvenient bath. Here are,\r\nvery properly, two sitting-rooms in each gallery, one for the quiet, the\r\nother for the turbulent; but I could wish that the noisy and turbulent\r\nwere in a separate part of the house by day and by night.... Several\r\nwomen were calm and quiet, and at needlework with the matron. A chapel\r\nwould be proper here for the advantage of recovering patients, as I have\r\nseen in such houses abroad.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, that although Howard observes, \"I greatly prefer\r\nthe asylum at Constantinople,\" he must refer to the less important\r\nmatter of the structure of the building. As also when mentioning St.\r\nPatrick's or Swift's Hospital at Dublin, he says he should prefer the\r\nDol-huis at Amsterdam and the hospital at Constantinople, \"where the\r\nrooms open into open corridors and gardens, which is far better than\r\ntheir opening into passages as here in England.\"[113]\r\n\r\nIn his previous work, 1784, Howard observes, speaking of English\r\nprisons, \"I must add here that in some few gaols are confined idiots and\r\nlunatics. These serve for sport to idle visitors at assizes and other\r\ntimes of general resort. Many of the Bridewells are crowded and\r\noffensive, because the rooms which were designed for prisoners are\r\noccupied by the insane (by the Irish Act, 3 Geo. III., such persons are\r\nrequired to be kept separate). Where they are not kept separate, they\r\ndisturb and terrify other prisoners. No care is taken of them, although\r\nit is probable that by medicines, and proper regimen, some of them\r\nmight be restored to their senses and to usefulness in life.\"[114]\r\n\r\nWe shall see more clearly, as we proceed, what was the condition of the\r\ninsane in England at the latter part of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nA time then came--in the year 1792--fraught with an event as important\r\nas it was unexpected, the beginning, on a small scale, of the reform\r\nwhich ultimately took place in the condition of British asylums; a\r\nreform slowly brought about by means which might have seemed very\r\ninadequate for the purpose. But the poet warns us to\r\n\r\n    \"Think naught a trifle, though it small appear;\r\n     Small sands the mountain, moments make the year,\r\n     And trifles life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd does not Joseph de Maistre well say, \"Aucune grande chose n'eut de\r\ngrands commencements\"--nothing great ever began great?\r\n\r\nI should premise that there was at York an asylum founded some fifteen\r\nyears before, on a charitable foundation, with it cannot be doubted, the\r\nbest intentions on the part of its promoters, but, unfortunately, its\r\nmanagement had been no better than the worst asylums of that day. It\r\nhappened that, in 1791, the friends of a patient who was confined there,\r\ndesiring to visit her, were refused admission, and suspicion was aroused\r\nas to the treatment to which she was subjected, with (as the event\r\nproved) only too much reason, and not, as sometimes happens at the\r\npresent time, without just occasion, and, indeed, on the most frivolous\r\nand vexatious pretences. The knowledge that such is the case ought to\r\nmake us very careful how we sit in judgment on our predecessors in\r\nregard to any charge brought against them. There is, however, undeniable\r\nevidence, proof which cannot be evaded, and ultimately admitted by all,\r\nthat the asylum at York of which I speak was a frightful abode for\r\nlunatics. The time had not come for its public exposure, but instead of\r\nthis it was proposed by a citizen of York--William Tuke--that an\r\ninstitution should be erected where there should be no concealment, and\r\nwhere the patients should be treated with all the kindness which their\r\ncondition allowed. His mind, full of common sense, suggestive, and not\r\nseeing why the right thing should not be done--in fact, his creed being\r\nthat it must be done--he set resolutely to work to effect his purpose.\r\nIt became with him a question of humanity and right, and he resolved\r\nthat if he could be the means of effecting it, there should be an asylum\r\nopenly conducted and on humane principles. He talked over the project\r\nwith his friends, and having at last formed a definite plan, he brought\r\nit forward before an assembly of the communion of which he was a\r\nmember--the Society of Friends. I should have stated that the patient in\r\nthe York Asylum to whom I have referred belonged to the same body. As\r\nwas natural, difficulties were at first suggested; but, having an iron\r\nwill, as well as a kind heart, he overcame them before long, and\r\neventually succeeded in his object. His feeling that something should\r\nbe done had been strengthened by a visit he had paid to St. Luke's\r\nHospital, where he saw the patients lying on straw and in chains. He was\r\ndistressed with the scene, and could not help believing that there was a\r\nmore excellent way. He resolved that an attempt should be made to\r\nameliorate their miserable condition. His proposition was made in the\r\nspring of 1792. Adopted, and the funds provided, steps were taken for\r\nerecting an institution in a healthy locality in the neighbourhood of\r\nYork. \"The ground was elevated, and the situation afforded excellent air\r\nand water, as well as a very extensive and diversified prospect.\" The\r\nillustration (Frontispiece) will convey a better idea than any verbal\r\ndescription of this unpretentious building. Its character as a labour of\r\nlove and humanity was embodied in an inscription written at the time,\r\nwhich may be discovered whenever the foundation stone is disinterred:--\r\n\r\n               HOC FECIT\r\n    AMICORUM CARITAS IN HUMANITATIS\r\n               ARGUMENTUM\r\n           ANNO DNI MDCCXCII.\r\n\r\nReferring to the establishment of the Retreat, an American physician of\r\ncelebrity in the department of Psychological Medicine says, \"Merit of\r\nthis kind is seldom duly appreciated by the world, for it does not\r\nstrike the imagination like that of brilliant discoveries in the\r\nphysical sciences, and the very reason that reforms like that in\r\nquestion are so obviously sanctioned and confirmed by common sense and\r\nthe feelings of common humanity is apt to detract from the merit of\r\nthose who conceive them.\"[115]\r\n\r\nThere are several points to which I have devoted considerable labour\r\namong the archives of the Retreat, and on which I have had the advantage\r\nof frequently conversing with the author of the \"Description of the\r\nRetreat\" in former years. Among these I may refer to an interesting\r\nexplanation of the origin of the now familiar term \"Retreat\" as applied\r\nto a lunatic asylum. One day the conversation in the family circle\r\nturned on the question, What name should be given to the proposed\r\ninstitution? when my grandmother, who was much interested in the\r\nestablishment, quickly remarked that it should be called a _Retreat_. It\r\nwas at once seen that feminine instinct had solved the question, and the\r\nname was adopted, \"to convey the idea of what such an institution should\r\nbe, namely, a place in which the unhappy might obtain a refuge; a quiet\r\nhaven in which the shattered bark might find the means of reparation or\r\nof safety;\"--a term which became the parent of numberless imitations,\r\nsome of them, it must be confessed, only so called by a miserable irony.\r\nIt need hardly be remarked that this term had been from an early period\r\nemployed in the Church of Rome to indicate a place of resort for\r\nmeditation and penance during certain periods of the year.\r\n\r\nFamily tradition says that the wife of the projector of the Retreat--a\r\nwoman of great force of character--questioned at first his wisdom in\r\nproposing the foundation of such an institution. He had (with her full\r\nconcurrence) already established a school for the higher education of\r\ngirls, among other projects which sprang from his fertile brain, and she\r\nplayfully told him that people would say he had had many children, and\r\nthat his last was an idiot. Here for once the woman's instinct failed,\r\nand masculine sense succeeded. Some of his co-religionists also\r\ndiscouraged the undertaking. \"Looking back to the year 1792, and\r\nconsidering the miserable condition of the insane in general at that\r\nperiod, it appears to us almost strange that the proposal should have\r\nmet in the first instance with considerable opposition, and that the\r\ninstitution had to struggle through many difficulties into\r\nexistence.\"[116]\r\n\r\nThe experiment began in earnest, on the opening of the establishment,\r\nfour years after it was instituted, the projector residing at and\r\nsuperintending it, a short interval excepted, until the appointment of\r\nJepson, who, as well as his wife, the matron, were admirably adapted for\r\ntheir posts. During this period, \"the founder,\" says the historiographer\r\nof the Retreat, \"superintended the management of the patients, and\r\nentered into their cases with great zeal, discrimination, and humanity.\"\r\n\r\nLetters in my possession, written by him, attest this, and also the\r\ndifficulties which he encountered; for in one of them he writes, \"All\r\nmen seem to desert me in matters essential.\" Happily, however, a\r\nlike-minded man, in many respects, was at last found in Jepson, who\r\nbecame an excellent superintendent, and remained at his post until the\r\ndeath of the founder, who to an advanced age continued, to quote his\r\ngrandson, \"to pay very close attention to the institution, generally\r\nvisiting it several times a week.\"\r\n\r\nIt was early seen that work in the open air would be an important help\r\nin the experiment, and enough land for a farm had been obtained. I\r\nobserve that, among other things, the fact particularly struck a Swiss\r\nphysician who visited the Retreat not long after it was opened. He\r\nremarks on its presenting the appearance of a large rural farm, and on\r\nits being surrounded by a garden. He was also struck by another\r\nimportant feature: \"There is no bar or grating to the windows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cette maison est situee a un mille de York au mileau d'une campagne\r\nfertile et riante; ce n'est point l'idee d'une prison qu'elle fait\r\nnaitre, mais plutot celle d'une grande ferme rustique; elle est entouree\r\nd'un jardin ferme. Point de barreau, point de grillages aux fenetres, on\r\ny a supplee par un moyen dont je rendrai compte ci-apres.\r\n\r\n\"Vous voyez, que dans le traitement moral on ne considere pas les fous\r\ncomme absolument prives de raison, c'est-a-dire, comme inaccessibles aux\r\nmotifs de crainte, d'esperance, de sentiment et d'honneur, on les\r\nconsidere plutot, ce semble, comme des enfans qui ont un superflu de\r\nforce et qui en faisoient un emploi dangereux.\"[117]\r\n\r\nPinel had now been at work five years, and for the first time heard of\r\nthe management of the Retreat from the glowing account published by this\r\nSwiss physician Dr. Delarive. The conductors of the Retreat first became\r\nacquainted with Pinel's great work at the Bicetre in Paris in 1806.\r\n\r\nAn incident related in honour of Jepson may fitly be introduced here. He\r\n\"had found the doctrine of subduing the insane by fear maintained in St.\r\nLuke's Hospital, which was then esteemed, and probably justly, the best\r\npublic establishment of the kind in Great Britain; and he could not but\r\nattach considerable value to its long and extensive experience. Soon\r\nafter entering upon his office, a very violent patient came under his\r\ncare. His friend and adviser (Tuke) was from home, and he determined for\r\nonce, upon his own responsibility, to act upon the prevalent notion. In\r\nsize he was not ill qualified to do the duty of a keeper upon the old\r\nsystem, but his feelings and all the habits of his mind were opposed to\r\nharsh methods. After the experiment he was so uneasy with himself, that\r\non retiring to bed he slept but little, and he resolved that, if the\r\ncourse he had adopted was not in this case beneficial, he would entirely\r\nabandon the system. On visiting the patient his opinion was that the\r\nexperiment had failed, and that it had left a painful and vindictive\r\nfeeling on the mind of the subject of it.\" It is added that henceforth\r\nJepson fully carried out, step by step, the views of the founder and his\r\nfriends.[118]\r\n\r\nThe earnestness with which the officers who were appointed entered into\r\nthe undertaking--the way in which they helped to make possible the\r\nsuccess so much desired by the founder--deserves our grateful\r\nappreciation, and should preserve them from being in the least degree\r\nthrown into the shade. To enter heartily into the ideas and schemes of\r\nother people may be as meritorious as to originate them, and is often\r\nmuch more irksome. It is neither necessary nor generous to exalt one\r\nclass of workers at the expense of the other. No doubt the originator of\r\nthe Retreat was one who also worked hard himself at what he had\r\ninitiated; but he could not have eventually succeeded if he had not been\r\nable to attract to himself men who would devote their powers to the new\r\nwork in the same spirit as he did. Such men were Jepson and Fowler, the\r\nlatter of whom, the first visiting physician,[119] died five years after\r\nhis appointment. Such also was Dr. Cappe, his successor, who was cut off\r\nin his prime deeply regretted--\"a man equally esteemed for the gentle\r\nurbanity of his manner, the excellence of his understanding and\r\ndispositions, and his professional attainments.\"[120]\r\n\r\nIt is not always that the insane are able to appreciate the efforts made\r\nto render them comfortable. It is all the more gratifying when it does\r\noccur. A patient was admitted who had nearly lost the use of his limbs\r\nfrom being chained, and for some time it was necessary to lead him\r\nabout like an infant. He was found to require no restraint, and was,\r\nafter a while, able to walk without assistance. When one of his friends\r\nvisited him and asked him what he called the place, he replied, with\r\ngreat earnestness, \"Eden, Eden, Eden!\"\r\n\r\nA man was admitted who had been for twenty years chained and naked; with\r\nthe exception of the occasional use of arm-straps, no personal restraint\r\nwas employed from the moment of his admission. He was soon induced to\r\nwear clothes and adopt orderly habits.\r\n\r\nOne day a man of Herculean size was brought to the institution, and the\r\ncase is thus described by the author of the \"Description\": \"He had been\r\nafflicted several times before; and so constantly, during the present\r\nattack, had he been kept chained, that his clothes were contrived to be\r\ntaken off and put on by means of strings, without removing his manacles.\r\nThey were, however, taken off when he entered the Retreat, and he was\r\nushered into the apartment where the superintendent and matron were\r\nsupping. He was calm. His attention appeared to be arrested by his new\r\nsituation. He was desired to join in the repast, during which he behaved\r\nwith tolerable propriety. After it was concluded, the superintendent\r\nconducted him to his apartment, and told him the circumstances on which\r\nhis treatment would depend; that it was his anxious wish to make every\r\ninhabitant in the house as comfortable as possible, and that he\r\nsincerely hoped the patient's conduct would render it unnecessary for\r\nhim to have recourse to coercion. The maniac was sensible of the\r\nkindness of his treatment. He promised to restrain himself, and he so\r\ncompletely succeeded, that, during his stay, no coercive means were ever\r\nemployed towards him.\" When excited and vociferous, the superintendent\r\nwent to his room and sat quietly beside him. After a period of increased\r\nirritation, the violent excitement subsided, and he would listen with\r\nattention to the persuasions and arguments of his friendly visitor. \"Can\r\nit be doubted,\" asks Tuke, \"that in this case the disease had been\r\ngreatly exasperated by the mode of management, or that the subsequent\r\nkind treatment had a great tendency to promote his recovery?\"\r\n\r\nAn architect, Mr. Stark, in visiting British asylums, when engaged in\r\npreparing plans for the Glasgow Asylum, came to the Retreat. He thus\r\nspeaks in his \"Remarks on the Construction and Management of Lunatic\r\nAsylums\": \"In some asylums which I have visited, chains are affixed to\r\nevery table and to every bed-post; in others, they are not to be found\r\nwithin the walls.... At the Retreat they sometimes have patients brought\r\nto them frantic and in irons, whom they at once release, and by mild\r\narguments and gentle arts reduce almost immediately to obedience and\r\norderly behaviour. A great deal of delicacy appears in the attentions\r\npaid to the smaller feelings of the patients. The iron bars which\r\nguarded the windows have been avoided, and neat iron sashes, having all\r\nthe appearance of wooden ones, have been substituted in their places;\r\nand when I visited them, the managers were occupied in contriving how to\r\nget rid of the bolts with which the patients are shut up at night, on\r\naccount of their harsh, ungrateful sound, and of their communicating to\r\nthe asylum somewhat of the air and character of a prison. The effects of\r\nsuch attentions, both on the happiness of the patients and the\r\ndiscipline of the institution, are more important than may at first view\r\nbe imagined. Attachment to the place and to the managers, and an air of\r\ncomfort and of contentment, rarely exhibited within the precincts of\r\nsuch establishments, are consequences easily discovered in the general\r\ndemeanour of the patients.\" \"It is a government,\" Stark also observes,\r\n\"of humanity and of consummate skill, and requires no aid from the arm\r\nof violence and the exertions of brutal force.\"[121] But Stark himself,\r\nstrange to say, is careful not to commit himself to the total abolition\r\nof chains, adopted at the Retreat.\r\n\r\nTwo more brief testimonies from competent visitors who inspected the\r\ninstitution may be permitted--one from Dr. Duncan of Edinburgh, when on\r\na tour of inspection of asylums in Britain; the other from a foreigner,\r\nDr. Naudi, then the \"President of the Maltese Hospitals.\" The former\r\nwrote, after visiting the Retreat, of the demonstration, \"beyond\r\ncontradiction, of the very great advantage resulting from a mode of\r\ntreatment in cases of insanity much more mild than was before introduced\r\ninto almost any lunatic asylum, either at home or abroad. In the\r\nmanagement of this institution they have set an example which claims the\r\nimitation, and deserves the thanks, of every sect and every nation. For,\r\nwithout much hazard of contradiction from those acquainted with the\r\nsubject, it may be asserted that the Retreat at York is at this moment\r\nthe best-regulated establishment in Europe, either for the recovery of\r\nthe insane, or for their comfort when they are in an incurable state.\"\r\nAnd Dr. Naudi, in broken but effective English, observed, \"This house or\r\nRetreat for the troubled in mind, I think, is one of the best things I\r\nsaw in England on the same subject; and having observed many others on\r\nthe Continent, I dare to say it is the best in all the world. The\r\nsituation of the building out of the town, a large garden around it, the\r\npropriety of the rooms, the cleanliness of the patients, the way in\r\nwhich they are kept, as for dressing, as for feeding them, is very\r\nremarkable to be observed.\"\r\n\r\nThe institution had not been very long in full operation before the\r\nsuccess of the more enlightened treatment pursued in it was so patent,\r\nthat the same pleasure and astonishment which the Swiss doctor\r\nexperienced became general, and it was decided, in the hope of inducing\r\nothers to follow a like course, to publish an account of the means which\r\nhad been adopted in the treatment of the patients. This \"Description of\r\nthe Retreat,\" by S. Tuke, containing \"An Account of its Origin and\r\nProgress, the Modes of Treatment, and a Statement of Cases,\" appeared in\r\n1813.[122] Sydney Smith helped to bring the book into notice by his\r\nfavourable review of it in the _Edinburgh_. In it he says of the\r\nRetreat:--\r\n\r\n\"The great principle on which it appears to be conducted is that of\r\nkindness to the patients. It does not appear to them (the managers),\r\nbecause a man is mad upon one particular subject, that he is to be\r\nconsidered in a state of complete mental degradation, or insensible to\r\nthe feelings of kindness and gratitude. When a madman does not do what\r\nhe is bid to do, the shortest method, to be sure, is to knock him down;\r\nand straps and chains are the species of prohibitions which are the\r\nleast frequently disregarded. But the Society of Friends seems rather to\r\nconsult the interest of the patient than the ease of his keeper, and to\r\naim at the government of the insane by creating in them the kindest\r\ndisposition towards those who have the command over them. Nor can\r\nanything be more wise, humane, or interesting than the strict attention\r\nto the feelings of their patients which seems to prevail in the\r\ninstitution.... To the effects of kindness in the Retreat are superadded\r\nthose of constant employment. The female patients are employed as much\r\nas possible in sewing, knitting, and domestic affairs; and several of\r\nthe convalescents assist the attendants. For the men are selected those\r\nspecies of bodily employment most agreeable to the patient, and most\r\nopposite to the illusions of his disease.\" He proceeds to say that in\r\nthis instance, \"an example has been set of courage, patience, and\r\nkindness which cannot be too highly commended or too widely diffused,\r\nand which, we are convinced, will gradually bring into repute a milder\r\nand better method of treating the insane.\"[123]\r\n\r\nThe author of the above work took an active part in the management of\r\nthe Retreat for more than forty years, strenuously aided in exposing the\r\nabuses of the York Asylum, and exerted no inconsiderable influence upon\r\nthe movement on behalf of the insane, not only by the work referred to,\r\nbut by his writings on the construction of asylums.[124]\r\n\r\nI find an entry in his journal, made in April, 1811, that he had begun\r\nan Essay on the state of the insane poor for a periodical called the\r\n_Philanthropist_. His indignation had been aroused by witnessing the\r\ncondition of pauper lunatics in a workhouse in the south of England. He\r\nwas led into a small yard at a short distance from the principal\r\nbuilding, in which were four cells. He found them large enough for one\r\nperson. At the further end of each was a platform of wood attached to\r\nthe wall, which was intended for the patient's bed. In two of the cells\r\nall the light and air which could be admitted passed through an iron\r\ngrating in the door, so that the cold air could not be excluded without\r\nentirely darkening the apartment. In each of these cells a female was\r\nconfined. \"I cannot describe,\" he says, \"my feelings and astonishment\r\nwhen I perceived that the poor women were absolutely without any\r\nclothes. The weather was intensely cold, and the evening previous to our\r\nvisit, the thermometer had been sixteen degrees below freezing. One of\r\nthese forlorn objects lay buried under a miserable cover of straw,\r\nwithout a blanket or even a horse-cloth to defend her from the cold.\"\r\nSo of the others, one of whom had the leg chained to the platform at the\r\nend of the cell. Bitter complaints were made of cold. Flannel dresses\r\nwere at once sent to the workhouse for these poor wretches, which they\r\nwore, and invoked many blessings on the giver, who denounced the conduct\r\nof the guardians and writes, \"Surely, a mind, actuated by the virtuous\r\nsympathies of our nature, would not have joined with comfort the warm\r\nsocial circle, or repose his head on a soft pillow, whilst he knew that\r\nany one was enduring so many privations, and so much misery which was\r\nnot only in his power but was his duty to relieve.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that a Select Committee had been appointed (moved\r\nfor by Mr. Wynn) five years before (1806), to inquire into the state of\r\npauper lunatics in England. This Committee proposed the erection of\r\nasylums in different parts of the kingdom, power being given to the\r\nmagistrates of any county to charge the expense upon the county rate,\r\nall pauper lunatics within the district being conveyed thither and\r\nmaintained at the expense of their respective parishes, and it was\r\nrecommended that no asylum should contain more than 300 patients. At\r\nthat time there were 1765 lunatics in workhouses, or houses of industry,\r\n483 in private custody, 113 in houses of correction, and 27 in gaols;\r\ntotal, 2248.[125] Sir George Paul, who took an active interest in this\r\nCommittee, stated, in a letter to the Secretary of State, that there was\r\nhardly a parish of any considerable extent in which there might not be\r\nfound some unfortunate human creature, who, if his ill-treatment had\r\nmade him \"frenetic,\" was chained in the cellar or garret of a workhouse,\r\nfastened to the leg of a table, tied to a post in an outhouse, or\r\nperhaps shut up in an uninhabited ruin; or, if his lunacy were\r\ninoffensive, was left to ramble, half-naked and half-starved, through\r\nthe streets and highways, teased by the rabble, and made the jest of the\r\nvulgar, ignorant, and unfeeling. \"I have witnessed,\" he says, \"instances\r\nof each of these modes of securing lunatics, under the Act 17 Geo. II.,\r\nc. 5. Of all the lunatics in the kingdom, the one half are not under any\r\nkind of protection from ill-treatment, or placed in a situation to be\r\nrelieved of their malady.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1808) an Act (48 Geo. III., c. 96) was passed,\r\nproviding that it should be lawful for justices in every county in\r\nEngland and Wales to take into consideration the propriety of providing\r\na lunatic asylum for the reception of patients within the county.\r\nReferring to the Act 17 Geo. II. for the committal of vagrant lunatics,\r\nthe new Act provided that in case there should be an asylum established\r\nfor the county within which the lunatic belonged, then a warrant should\r\nbe issued for the removal of such lunatic to the asylum, and not\r\nelsewhere; but if no asylum had been erected, then he was to be confined\r\nin any house duly licensed under the authority of the Act of 14 Geo.\r\nIII. It will be seen that this legislation was not compulsory, and\r\ntherefore utterly failed in attaining the object of its promoters. It\r\nonly authorized magistrates to act.\r\n\r\nThis Act was amended in some points of importance in 1811.[126]\r\nOverseers were obliged to produce a certificate of a medical man as to\r\nthe state of the lunatic. Justices were to make returns to the quarter\r\nsessions of the cases brought before them, and medical superintendents\r\nreturns of the state of persons intrusted to their care, at least once a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\"The Description of the Retreat,\" then, of which Dr. Conolly writes in\r\n1856, \"For readers desirous to know the views which ought to prevail in\r\nall lunatic asylums, I could not even now refer to any work in which\r\nthey are more perspicuously explained; in none are the details of\r\nmanagement, economic, medical, and moral, to be found more convincingly\r\nset forth\"--this work, happily, proved the means,[127] by the\r\nextraordinary interest it excited in the experiment, and the contrast it\r\nwas but too well known to exhibit to the general condition of similar\r\ninstitutions, of arousing attention, first to the abuses of the old\r\nasylum at York, and then to others, until it was deemed desirable to\r\nappoint a Committee of the House of Commons to investigate the subject\r\nthoroughly. To this we shall refer in more detail, but may here observe\r\nthat the founder of the Retreat was one who gave evidence before it, and\r\nthe members, says an eye-witness, were evidently interested in seeing\r\nthe old man, then upwards of eighty, and hearing from his own lips some\r\nof the facts relating to the success of the experiment at York. He\r\ncontinued to devote himself to the interest of the institution, and died\r\nin 1822, thirty years after he had broached the idea of its\r\nestablishment. It had, he said, some years before, succeeded far beyond\r\nhis expectations, and he felt a wish to contribute such information as\r\nattentive observation had enabled him to make for the benefit of others.\r\nThis he did in various ways, one being a Letter to the governors of the\r\nYork Lunatic Asylum, in which he observes, \"At the time of Lord\r\nErskine's Chancellorship, I noticed with much satisfaction his remarks\r\non the treatment of insane patients, especially in private mad-houses,\r\nwhich he found was so generally severe, that in case they were but a\r\nlittle deranged, it was sufficient to make them raving mad; and he\r\ndelivered it as his judgment that kind and conciliating treatment was\r\nthe best means to promote recovery. The latter part of this opinion I\r\nhave the satisfaction of asserting has been evidently proved correct in\r\nthe management of the Retreat, where coercion, though sometimes\r\nnecessary for feeding the patients and preserving them from injury to\r\nthemselves or others, is administered in the most gentle manner, and the\r\nuse of chains is never resorted to.\"\r\n\r\n\"In person,\" wrote a contemporary, \"William Tuke hardly reached the\r\nmiddle size, but was erect, portly, and of a firm step. He had a noble\r\nforehead, an eagle eye, a commanding voice, and his mien was dignified\r\nand patriarchal.\"\r\n\r\nHe was ninety when he died, and it may be added that Willan made a happy\r\nhit when he said, on being consulted by him many years before, \"There is\r\na pulse which will beat till ninety.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Of no distemper, of no blast he died,\r\n     But fell like autumn fruit that mellowed long:\r\n     Even wondered at, because he dropt no sooner.\r\n     Fate seemed to wind him up for fourscore years;\r\n     Yet freshly ran he on ten winters more,\r\n     Till like a clock worn out with eating time,\r\n     The wheels of weary life at last stood still.\"\r\n\r\n                                DRYDEN, _OEdipus_, Act iii. sc. 1.\r\n\r\nFrench physicians have done justice generously and ungrudgingly to the\r\nservices rendered by the York reformers in the management of the insane.\r\nParchappe, late Inspector-General of the \"Service des Alienes\" in\r\nFrance, wrote: \"La Retraite d'York, dont Samuel Tuke publia la\r\ndescription en 1813, fut consideree comme l'ecole ou les alienistes\r\ndevaient s'instruire et comme le modele auquel ils devaient se\r\nconformer. La creation et l'organisation de cet etablissement a eu la\r\nplus grande influence sur le developpement des bonnes methodes de\r\ntraitement et sur le perfectionnement des asiles en Angleterre.\"[128]\r\n\r\nFerrus, physician to Napoleon I., visited the English asylums in 1826,\r\nin order to obtain some useful hints in the management of similar\r\ninstitutions in France, and commends, in a passage which I shall quote,\r\nthe mild means of coercion resorted to at the Retreat. He speaks of it\r\nas the first asylum in England which arrested the attention of\r\nforeigners, and proceeds, \"Mr. Tuke was a man for whom religion and\r\nmorality were practical virtues, and in whose eyes neither riches nor\r\npoverty, imbecility nor genius, ought in the slightest degree to affect\r\nthe bonds which unite all men together in common. He thought, with\r\nreason, that justice and force ought to be evinced, not by shouts and\r\nmenaces, but by gentleness of character and calmness of mind, in order\r\nthat the influence of these qualities might make themselves felt upon\r\nall, even when excited by anger, intoxication, and madness. The\r\ntraditions of this friend of humanity are preserved in the house which\r\nhe founded. Everything, even down to the patients, is silent and\r\npeaceful in this asylum, where some who are not members of the Society\r\nof Friends are also admitted. Those admitted, be their religion or\r\nsocial position what they may, whatever even their habits may have been,\r\ninfluenced by the tranquillity of the place and the force of example,\r\nfind repose in this house, which much more resembles a convent of\r\nTrappists than a mad-house; and if one's heart is saddened at the sight\r\nof this terrible malady, we experience emotions of pleasure in\r\nwitnessing all that an ingenious benevolence has been able to devise to\r\ncure or alleviate it.... The reputation of this institution is the best\r\nestablished of any in England. We are assured that the number of cures\r\nis considerable, and we willingly believe this, because the general\r\nmanagement of the house is favourable to the treatment of insanity.\"\r\n\r\nThirty years afterwards, when I paid a visit to Ferrus in Paris, he\r\nrecalled, with great animation, the impressions he at this period\r\nreceived at the York Retreat.\r\n\r\nNor have the Americans been less grudging in their encomiums. Dr. Ray,\r\none of their most distinguished physicians devoted to the treatment of\r\nthe insane, whom I have already quoted, after visiting our asylums many\r\nyears ago, bore witness to the results of the reform \"so thoroughly\r\neffected at the York Retreat,\" and speaks of the founder as clear-headed\r\nand warm-hearted, one \"who, true to his faith, conceived the idea that\r\nthe insane, as well as the sane, could best be managed in the spirit of\r\npeace and good will.\" And Dr. Pliny Earle observes, \"It is now very\r\nfully demonstrated that the idea of the amelioration of the condition of\r\nthe insane was original with Pinel and Tuke, and that for some time they\r\nwere actively pursuing their object, each uninformed of the action of\r\nthe other. It is no new thing for inventions, discoveries, and\r\ninnovations upon traditionary practices to originate almost\r\nsimultaneously in more than one place, showing that they are called for\r\nby the times; that they are developments of science and humanity,\r\nnecessary evolutions of the human mind in its progress towards the\r\nunattainable perfect, rather than what may be termed a gigantic or\r\nmonstrous production of one intellectual genius. Each perceived the\r\nwretchedness, the misery, the sufferings of the insane around him; each\r\nwas moved to compassion; each resolved to effect a reform in their\r\ntreatment; each succeeded. The recognition of services to humanity is\r\ndue to each. To each we freely accord it.\"[129]\r\n\r\nDr. Brown, the late physician of the Bloomingdale Asylum, New York,\r\nafter visiting England in 1863, observes of the lunatic hospitals in\r\nEngland, \"There is one possessing historical fame and interest, which\r\nyet retains its early popularity, as well as its excellent reputation\r\namong medical men. The York Retreat, founded by the Society of Friends\r\nat the close of the last century, and hallowed in the memory of every\r\none who appreciates the spirit of beneficence which originated it and\r\nhas ever since pervaded its halls, still pursues its sacred mission of\r\nremoving and relieving mental diseases. Nowhere did I observe clearer\r\nevidence of intelligent and conscientious fulfilment of the humane\r\npurposes of all such institutions. The older sections of the building\r\nwere being gradually replaced by new constructions, which conform\r\ninteriorly to the present standard of advancement; and as for that\r\npersonal devotion of the chief officers, on which the welfare of\r\npatients must mainly depend, it was sufficiently apparent that the\r\ngenius and the earnestness of Tuke still abide among his\r\nsuccessors.\"[130]\r\n\r\nReturning now to what in the history of the rise and development of the\r\nmodern treatment of the insane is of great importance, the guiding\r\nprinciples of the treatment pursued at the York Retreat, and its\r\nrelation to what is understood as the non-restraint system, I would\r\nobserve that the first principle of all was an active humanity--the\r\nhighest form of it as embodied in the golden Christian rule. It has\r\noften been said that the members of the community by whose principles he\r\nwas animated seem to think it necessary to act as well as to talk; to\r\ncarry out their principles into actual practice, as if they were really\r\nintended to be applied to the ills of humanity. If some of his own\r\nfriends discouraged Tuke's benevolent designs, it may have arisen from\r\ntheir not being convinced that a case had been made out for its\r\nexercise. An accident, as it were, brought the fact of the\r\nunsatisfactory condition of the asylums of his day forcibly before him.\r\nAccustomed to do as well as to talk about doing, when he knew the\r\nexistence of an abuse, he set himself to work at once to prevent its\r\nrecurrence so far as the area of his own influence could extend.\r\nSuspecting unkind treatment, he strove to have it replaced by kindness;\r\nconvinced that abuses and cruelty ever tend to spring up when public\r\nsurveillance is refused, he resolved to do away with all secresy in the\r\nmanagement of the proposed institution. Further, he \"had a strong faith\r\nin the dictates of an enlightened conscience and in the perfect wisdom\r\nand love which direct every law of human duty.\"[131]\r\n\r\nThis principle not only accounts for the successful commencement of the\r\nundertaking, but helps to explain the individual treatment of the\r\ninsane; for the patients were treated as human beings suffering under a\r\nterrible affliction, toward whom it was a duty to extend consolation,\r\ncompassion, and kindness. This course necessarily led to the\r\ndemonstration that when so treated they were calmer and required\r\ncomparatively little restraint. The fact happily bore out the theory.\r\n\r\nBut a humane man may in the exercise of his humanity be injudicious, and\r\nby so doing inflict much actual suffering. The surgeon who to avoid\r\ninflicting pain should shrink from the complete removal of a malignant\r\ntumour, would fail to relieve the patient as he ought to have done.\r\nTherefore something more than humane feeling is required. Judgment must\r\nbe exercised. Now, judgment and that common sense, or mother wit, which\r\nis so much better than mere routine practice, evidently characterized\r\nthe early treatment of the Retreat. As benevolent feeling naturally led\r\nto the non-use of chains and the minimum resort to restraint which then\r\nseemed possible, so common sense led to the avoidance of the periodical\r\nbloodletting and emetics then in fashion. It is a remarkable fact that\r\neven then it was seen that insanity rarely calls for depressing\r\nremedies, and the observation was made and acted upon that excitement is\r\noften relieved by a directly opposite treatment. They allowed a liberal\r\nnourishing diet[132] in cases of violent mania; a free supply of meat,\r\nor bread and cheese, and porter, was found of the greatest service at\r\nsupper in procuring sleep and reducing excitement. They had no faith in\r\nspecifics and nostrums in the cure of insanity, but medical treatment\r\nwas by no means despised, while a warm bath was found to be \"of greater\r\nimportance and efficacy, in most cases of melancholia, than all the\r\nother medical means which have been employed.\"[133]\r\n\r\nWith this, one cannot but contrast the old system, which was\r\nemphatically empirical and unscientific. It was continued without change\r\nfrom year to year, and it may truly be said that idleness and\r\nselfishness, still more than ignorance, constituted the vices of the old\r\nsystem. Those who treated the insane always encountered opposition by\r\nbrute force, instead of by energy and patience, which surmount\r\ndifficulties that to idleness are impassable mountains, and which\r\nselfishness would not, if it could, overcome. Again, from the\r\ncommencement of the Retreat, the idea was entertained of making the\r\ninstitution a home; and with this view the arrangement and surroundings\r\nwere made as cheerful and home-like as possible.\r\n\r\nAnother strong point was the employment of the patients; its vital\r\nimportance was forcibly felt from the first. Dr. Delarive, who inspected\r\nthe Retreat in 1798, particularly comments upon this novel feature of a\r\nmad-house. He found that an experiment recently made, that of inducing\r\nthe patients to cultivate the land, giving to each a task proportionate\r\nto his strength, had answered well. It was found that they were fond of\r\nthis exercise, and that they were much better after a day spent in this\r\nwork than when they had remained in the house, or when they had taken an\r\nordinary walk. Delarive went to see them at work, a sight so common now\r\nin our asylums that it seems strange it should have excited his\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nOf employment the author of the \"Description\" thus speaks: \"The female\r\npatients in the Retreat are employed as much as possible in sewing,\r\nknitting, or domestic affairs; and several of the convalescents assist\r\nthe attendants. Of all the modes by which the patients may be _induced\r\nto restrain themselves, regular employment is perhaps the most generally\r\nefficacious_; and those kinds of employment are doubtless to be\r\npreferred, both on a moral and a physical account, which are accompanied\r\nby considerable bodily action, that are most agreeable to the patient,\r\nand which are most opposite to the illusions of his disease.\"[134]\r\n\r\nWe find it insisted upon by those who had the management of the Retreat\r\nthat moral treatment is of the greatest importance; that gentleness must\r\ntake the place of violence;[135] that it is erroneous to suppose it\r\nnecessary to commence an acquaintance with lunatics by an exhibition of\r\nphysical strength; that every effort should be made to divert the mind\r\nof melancholiacs by bodily exercise, walks, conversation, reading, and\r\nother recreations; that the desire of esteem is a more powerful\r\nprinciple to appeal to than fear; that the best form of restraint is\r\nself-restraint; that patients should be treated as much as possible as\r\nrational beings, but that little or no advantage arises from reasoning\r\nwith them on their particular delusions; that it is desirable to\r\nencourage the influence of healthy religious principle over the mind of\r\nthe insane; that those who manage them should sedulously endeavour to\r\ngain their confidence and esteem, to arrest their attention and fix it\r\non objects opposed to their delusions, to call into action every\r\nremaining power and principle of the mind, and to remember that in the\r\nwreck of the intellect the affections not unfrequently survive.\r\n\r\nThis recapitulation of the salient features of the practice of the\r\nRetreat renders it easy to understand the position taken by the managers\r\nof the institution in regard to mechanical restraints. When kindness\r\nfailed to subdue maniacal excitement, when medical remedies exerted no\r\ncalming influence, mild forms of restraint were reluctantly adopted,\r\nrather than maintain a conflict between patient and attendant. It\r\nappears from the Retreat archives that not more than five per cent.,\r\nreckoning the night as well as the day, were restrained by strap or\r\nwaistcoat.[136] It is notorious that, at the same period, it was the\r\ncustom in some asylums, probably many, to chain to the bedstocks, at\r\nnight, every patient in the house. Ferrus, to whom I have referred, did\r\nnot find camisoles in use at St. Luke's in 1826, but \"strong chains were\r\nemployed to hold the excited patients. These chains, fixed at different\r\nheights to the sides of stoves (_chauffoirs_), have iron rings at the\r\nend, by means of which the arms or the legs of the patient are rendered\r\ncompletely immovable.... Far from fearing that a painful impression will\r\nbe produced on the patients by chains, they think, on the contrary, that\r\nthis apparatus exerts a beneficial influence upon them; that it\r\nintimidates, humbles them, and removes all desire to attempt to get rid\r\nof their fastenings.\" Ferrus says that at the Retreat he found a belt\r\nwas employed, softly padded, to which the arms were attached. \"We do not\r\nemploy it in France,\" he says, \"although it might in hot weather be\r\npreferable to the camisole.... The Retreat offers all the resources of\r\nart and the comforts of life (_douceurs de la vie_) compatible with the\r\ncondition of insane persons.\"\r\n\r\nCoercion was regarded at the Retreat as an evil--that is to say, it was\r\n\"thought abstractedly to have a tendency to retard the cure, by opposing\r\nthe influence of the moral remedies employed\"--but at the same time \"a\r\nnecessary evil,\" an unhappy alternative in certain cases. Practically,\r\nas we have seen, the amount of restraint was small; but no _rule_ of\r\npractice was laid down that it should never be resorted to. The abstract\r\nprinciple of non-restraint adopted at Lincoln and Hanwell was not\r\nenunciated. \"We greatly prefer,\" observes the author of the\r\n\"Description,\" \"to lay down no absolute rule of non-restraint, but to\r\nrefer to our resident officers the exercise of a sound discretion in\r\neach individual case.\" But the managers of the Retreat did undoubtedly\r\nlay down as a fundamental principle that \"_coercion will diminish or\r\nincrease as the moral treatment of the patient is more or less\r\njudicious_;\"[137] and therefore, although they did not anticipate that\r\npersonal restraint would be superseded by any other mode of treatment,\r\nthis principle is broad enough to embrace all that has since followed in\r\nthe way of non-restraint. The result, in the long run, of honestly\r\ncarrying out the doctrine to its legitimate consequences, will not very\r\nwidely differ from that reached by those who adopt \"non-restraint\" as an\r\nabstract theory in the first instance.\r\n\r\nJustice would scarcely be done to those who interested themselves in\r\nmental diseases during the latter half of the eighteenth and the\r\ncommencement of the nineteenth century, if we did not give the titles of\r\nsome of the works bearing on insanity which issued from the press during\r\nthis period. A treatise on Madness was written in 1757 by Batty. Perfect\r\nwrote \"Methods of Cure in some Particular Cases of Insanity\" in 1778,\r\nand \"Select Cases of Insanity\" in 1787, and \"Annals of Insanity\"\r\nfourteen years later. Perfect's treatment of insanity mainly consisted\r\nin bleeding, setons, electricity, and the administration of emetics,\r\ndigitalis, and antimony. Dr. T. Arnold published his \"Observations on\r\nthe Nature, etc., of Insanity,\" 1782. Harper published \"A Treatise on\r\nthe Real Cause and Cure of Insanity\" in 1789--a work ridiculed by Pinel.\r\nFaulkner wrote his \"Observations on the General and Improper Treatment\r\nof Insanity\" in 1790; and Pargeter his \"Observations on Maniacal\r\nDisorders\" in 1792. What, if any, beneficial effect these works produced\r\nupon the condition of the insane in the British Isles, I am unable to\r\nsay. Haslam wrote his \"Observations on Madness\" in 1798, and he was the\r\nauthor of several other works; but, whatever their value and interest,\r\nwe know but too well the condition of the patients in the asylum of\r\nwhich he was the apothecary. Crichton published his \"Inquiry into the\r\nNature and Origin of Mental Derangement\"--a work, certainly, of merit\r\nand the result of practical observation. In 1802 appeared \"De\r\nintellectus facultatum conditione in mentis Alienationis diversis\r\ngeneribus,\" by Campbell (Edinburgh). Cox published his \"Practical\r\nObservations on Insanity\" in 1804. (See Appendix B.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf Pinel, in relation to England, I must here say a few words.\r\n\r\nThe _Edinburgh Review_ of April, 1803, contains a review of Pinel's\r\nwork, which deserves attention from the tone in which it is, for the\r\nmost part, written. The Reviewer evidently thinks that England had very\r\nlittle to learn from France. The York Retreat had, indeed, been in\r\nactive operation for some years, and the treatment pursued there might,\r\nno doubt, have borne comparison with that at the Bicetre, but to speak\r\nof Great Britain as a whole having a decided superiority over other\r\ncountries in its moral treatment of maniacs was rather absurd. The\r\nReviewer regards Pinel as the first author on the Continent who is fully\r\nsensible of the advantage of such moral treatment, and then observes,\r\n\"To medical readers in this country many of our author's remarks will\r\nappear neither new nor profound, and to none will his work appear\r\ncomplete.... It may be considered as a sketch of what has already been\r\ndone, with some notices of what the author intends to do; though he\r\nseems frequently to wonder, with a smile of self-approbation, at what he\r\nthinks his own discoveries.\" And again: \"Dr. Pinel is desirous that\r\nFrance should have some claim to a judicious treatment of the disease of\r\nthe mind, the honour of which has hitherto been exclusively confined to\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find the Reviewer observing that Dr. Pinel appears to\r\ndisplay very little sagacity and precision in saying that in some cases\r\nthe brain is not affected. And again: \"He conceives that the result of\r\nthe examination of the periods of life most subject to insanity is alone\r\nsufficient to show how seldom it is owing to any organic affection of\r\nthe brain or the cranium. But in this opinion there is some\r\ninconsistency. For he soon after states that in thirty-six dissections\r\nhe found nothing more remarkable than in the brain of apoplectic and\r\nepileptic patients, or of persons who died from furor or convulsions.\r\nNow, this is a confession that some deviations from the natural and\r\nhealthy appearances were observed; and this is all that is contended\r\nfor, and all that the present limited state of our knowledge authorizes\r\nus to affirm.\" The Reviewer adds, no doubt with truth, \"If no organic\r\naffections are said to have been discovered, in some few instances, we\r\nshould not reason negatively from such dissections, perhaps cursorily\r\nand ignorantly made, and with instruments ill adapted to detect minute\r\nand apparently trivial deviations from the natural structure.\"\r\n\r\nThe following snarl is also noticeable:--\"He informs us that he has\r\nstudied with considerable attention the writings of Locke, Harris,\r\nCondillac, Smith, and Stewart; but the quotation of great names is not\r\nalways the surest proof of an accurate acquaintance with their works,\r\nand we are inclined to think that there is some ground for doubt in the\r\npresent instance.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reviewer is severe on Pinel's classification, which in the main has\r\nstood the test of all subsequent criticism to a remarkable degree. \"It\r\nmay,\" he says, \"be entitled to the praise of ingenuity, but we doubt\r\nwhether it is remarkable for its clearness and accuracy. Many of the\r\ndistinctions seem absurd, and others not well founded. The several kinds\r\nof insanity are not distinct; they are only varieties of the same\r\naffection. All the symptoms mentioned under these five heads occur in\r\nthe same patient. At different times he passes through all the\r\ngradations from furious phrenzy to complete fatuity.\" This criticism\r\nhas, of course, great force as opposed to all symptomological\r\nclassifications whatever, but not specially or mainly to Pinel's.\r\n\r\nOn the point whether madness can in certain cases be cured, Pinel's\r\nutterances are dismissed with downright contempt: \"Instead of any new\r\nlight being thrown upon this important question, or any new rules of\r\nconduct pointed out, our author gives a minute detail of two cases,\r\nwhere any ancient female of ordinary capacity could have decided as well\r\nas himself, and relates with laboured minuteness the contrary opinions\r\nof some eminent physicians on a late memorable occasion in this\r\ncountry.\" Pinel an old woman! It will probably be new to most, if not\r\nall, of our readers that this illustrious man was regarded in this light\r\nby the leading Review of our country, when his writings first became\r\nknown amongst us. The review ends, after crediting Pinel with some\r\nmerit, and commending his work as containing some profitable\r\ninstruction, with the exceedingly kind and patronizing observation that\r\n\"we are therefore inclined to make _an indulgent allowance_ (!) for the\r\nimperfect execution of many parts of Dr. Pinel's essay, and to entertain\r\nhopes of further information from his diligence and discernment\" (!!).\r\n\r\nInsular conceit could surely scarcely go further. However, the Edinburgh\r\nReviewer is forgotten and his name unknown; Pinel's name covered with\r\nglory, although not a popular hero; for when I made a pilgrimage to his\r\ngrave in the great Paris cemetery, _Pere la Chaise_, in 1878, I was a\r\nsolitary visitor, while crowds flocked to others, including that of\r\nThiers, which is in close proximity to it. I am glad to see it announced\r\nthat the _Societe Medico-psychologique_ of Paris is about to erect--not\r\ntoo soon--a statue to his memory.\r\n\r\nThe bold proceeding, as it seemed in those days, of freeing the\r\nlunatics at the Bicetre from their fetters, constitutes Pinel's title to\r\nhonour--an honour of which no man will succeed in robbing him. He will\r\nbe remembered when Dequin[138] is forgotten. Pinel, although his\r\nwritings would have made him eminent as a physician had he never\r\nrendered his name illustrious in reference to the insane, did not, as a\r\nstudy of his life abundantly proves, liberate the patients at the\r\nBicetre from their chains in direct consequence of his medical knowledge\r\nof insanity, but mainly, if not entirely, from the compassion which he\r\nfelt for their miserable condition. His knowledge, great before, was\r\nvastly increased after he had placed the patients in a more favourable\r\nstate for medical observation; in fact, it is obvious that the\r\nopportunities of scientific research, and specially of observing the\r\nsatisfactory progress of those labouring under the disease, were greatly\r\naugmented from the moment he introduced a humane system of treatment.\r\n\r\nHad my sketch comprised France as well as England, I should have\r\nattempted to give a description of the work he performed in Paris. But I\r\nmust not be tempted to go beyond my subject, and as a matter of fact the\r\ncourse of French and English reform in the treatment of the insane was\r\nentirely distinct and independent.[139]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[100] \"By Tho.

No. xii.), in reviewing this book,\r\nobserved: \"In 1813 Mr. Samuel Tuke published his 'Description of the\r\nRetreat,' the celebrated work, the title of which we have placed among\r\nothers at the head of our article.... The Retreat has been conducted\r\nfrom the beginning upon the principle that the utmost practicable degree\r\nof gentleness, tenderness, and attention to the comforts and feelings of\r\nthe patients was in the first place due to them as human beings; and in\r\nthe next place was infinitely the most promising means of effecting\r\ntheir recovery. The object of this work of Mr. Tuke was to describe the\r\nsystem of management which had been pursued in the Retreat; to make\r\nknown the success which had attended it; and to point out more\r\ndistinctly than had ever yet been done, the principle upon which that\r\nmanagement was founded (the principle of gentleness, and of regard to\r\nthe feelings of the patients) as the grand principle which ought to\r\nregulate the management of every establishment of the kind. The service\r\nwhich Mr. Tuke professed to render to the public by his book was\r\nassuredly of importance, and his book has performed it well.... In\r\nhaving pointed out this as the governing principle, he has rendered a\r\nservice to humanity of the greatest importance. It is this\r\ncharacteristic circumstance which will render the publication of his\r\nbook an era in the history of the treatment of this calamity. The book\r\nhas already met with great and almost universal attention. It has by the\r\nnation been much more than approved; it has been applauded and admired.\"\r\n\r\nThe reviewer continues: \"One thing we may venture to say, that it was\r\nhardly possible for a book to be written in a manner less calculated to\r\ngive offence to anybody.... Yet this book gave prodigious offence. It\r\nhas been regarded as a libel upon the York Asylum, and an attack upon it\r\nhas appeared in the newspapers.\" This was a letter signed \"Evigilator,\"\r\nwho was in reality the superintendent of the above institution. This led\r\nto a long and heated correspondence. About the same time a charge of ill\r\ntreatment of a patient in the York Asylum was made by a magistrate (Mr.\r\nGodfrey Higgins of Doncaster), whose persistent endeavours to bring this\r\nand other cases to the light of day were beyond praise, and happily\r\nproved successful at last.\r\n\r\nThe writer has in his possession a mass of private letters which passed\r\nbetween his father and Mr. Higgins on these cases, which indicate their\r\ncombined endeavours, made (under the fiercest opposition) to reform the\r\nhorrible abuses which had converted a well-intentioned charity into a\r\nhell upon earth.

The success of the Retreat\r\nexcited the jealousy and antipathy of the superintendent of the York\r\nAsylum; the discussion which ensued led to investigation; the\r\nrevelations which followed excited public opinion; the representatives\r\nof the people undertook an inquiry by means of a Select Committee, which\r\nfinally necessitated legislation, and this legislation by successive\r\nenactments wrought the wondrous and beneficial change which we now\r\nwitness. This sequence of events will be found to be borne out by facts,\r\nby any one who will investigate the literature of lunacy from 1792 to\r\nthe present time. Sydney Smith says, writing in 1817,[140] that \"the\r\nnew Establishment began the great revolution upon this subject, which\r\nwe trust the provisions of Parliament will complete.... In the course of\r\na few years the Institution had done so much by gentle methods, that a\r\nmodest and well-written volume, giving an account of it, excited\r\nuniversal interest, and, in fact, achieved what all the talents and\r\npublic spirit of Mason and his friends had failed to accomplish. It had\r\nstill better effects. A very inoffensive passage in this book roused, it\r\nseems, the animosity of the physician to the York Lunatic Asylum, and a\r\nletter which this gentleman published in one of the York newspapers,\r\nbecame the origin of a controversy among the governors of that\r\nestablishment, which terminated in August, 1814, after a struggle of\r\nnearly two years, in the complete overthrow of the old system, and the\r\ndismission of every officer of the asylum, except the physician himself.\r\nThe period is not remote when lunatics were regarded as beings\r\nunsusceptible of mental enjoyment or of bodily pain, and accordingly\r\nconsigned without remorse, to prisons under the name of mad-houses--in\r\nthe contrivance of which nothing seems to have been considered, but how\r\nto enclose the victim of insanity in a cell, and to cover his misery\r\nfrom the light of day. But the success of the Retreat demonstrated, by\r\nexperiment, that all the apparatus of gloom and confinement was\r\ninjurious; and the necessity for improvement becoming daily more\r\napparent, a 'Bill for the Better Regulation of Mad-houses' was brought\r\ninto Parliament by Mr. Rose in 1813, but was nevertheless opposed and\r\nfinally withdrawn; and another Bill, in 1814,[141] though it passed the\r\nCommons, was rejected by the House of Lords. The public, in fact, was\r\nnot yet aware of the atrocious evils which these Bills were intended to\r\nremove; and it was not until now that the course was adopted, which, in\r\nevery case of public grievance, is the only sure one for obtaining\r\nredress. A Committee of the House of Commons, appointed for the purpose\r\nof inquiry in 1814, and revived in the following year, was fortunately\r\ncomposed of men determined to do the business they had undertaken.\"[142]\r\n\r\nMr. Rose, on the 28th of April, 1815, again introduced the subject of\r\nprivate mad-houses to Parliament, and, dwelling on the great abuses\r\nconnected with them, pointed out the necessity of their condition being\r\nexamined into by the House. He said that among the cases which had\r\nrecently come to his knowledge was that of a young woman who, although\r\nrequiring some restraint, was perfectly harmless. She was found chained\r\nto the ground by both legs and arms, a degree of cruelty which was in no\r\nrespect justified. With a view of correcting such practices, he moved\r\n\"that a Committee be appointed to consider of provision being made for\r\nthe better regulation of mad-houses in England, and to report the same,\r\nwith their observations thereupon, to the House.\"[143] The motion was\r\nagreed to.\r\n\r\nThe York Lunatic Asylum stood first upon the evidence before the Select\r\nCommittee. \"It appears from the history of that institution, which was\r\npublished at the close of the controversy above alluded to, that the\r\nvictory of the reformers was not obtained without strong opposition;\r\nfor, at the very moment when the state of things that we shall presently\r\ndetail was flourishing in full enormity, their opponents were enabled to\r\ncarry a resolution of the governors, declaring that a lunatic, who\r\nappears to have sustained gross injury, 'had been treated with all\r\npossible care, attention, and humanity,' and censuring the parties who\r\nbrought forward the complaint.... On a subsequent day thirteen spirited\r\nmen (including Mr. Higgins and Mr. Tuke) determined to _enforce_\r\ninvestigation; and, having qualified themselves as governors by paying\r\nthe requisite donation of L20 each, succeeded in obtaining the\r\nappointment of a Committee to inquire into the complaints that had been\r\nexhibited; which, after meeting for several successive days, and\r\nexamining witnesses, concluded by adopting Resolutions of censure upon\r\nthe proceedings proved before them.\"[144]\r\n\r\nOne day Mr. Higgins went to the asylum. After having seen all the\r\npatients' rooms, he went with the steward to the kitchen. There he was\r\nstruck with \"the retired appearance\" of a door. He ordered a keeper to\r\nunlock it. He perceived fear and hesitation. He repeated his order in\r\nstronger language. The key not being readily forthcoming, Mr. Higgins\r\ngrew warm, and declared he would soon find a key that would open it at\r\nthe kitchen fireside. It was then opened. He went in, and discovered a\r\nrow of cells, four in number, which had been concealed from the\r\ncommittee of investigation. On entering the first cell, he found it in a\r\nstate dreadful beyond description. The cell was about eight feet and a\r\nhalf square, perfectly dark when the door was shut, and the stench\r\nalmost intolerable. He was told these cells were occupied at night by\r\nthirteen women, who were then upstairs; where he found them in a room\r\ntwelve feet long by seven feet ten inches wide, with a window, which not\r\nopening would not admit of ventilation. Sydney Smith well says, after\r\nciting more horrible details than I have given, that he is aware of the\r\ndisgust which they will cause, but that he cannot spare his readers, and\r\nasks of the most delicate of them whether it is more shocking that these\r\nthings should exist unknown, and consequently unredressed, than that\r\nthey should be told and punished, and _remembered for ever, as the only\r\nmeans of preventing their recurrence_.\r\n\r\nTo enter into much detail is impossible. It must suffice to say that\r\ncase after case of gross neglect and cruelty was brought to light; that\r\nwhile 365 patients had died, only 221 had been reported; that a patient\r\nhaving been killed, his body was hurried away to prevent an inquest;\r\nthat when the accounts were examined, it was discovered that two sets of\r\nbooks of receipts were kept, one of which was only presented to the\r\ngovernors, and that the difference between the sums contained in the\r\ntwo, amounting to some hundreds a year, found its way into the pocket of\r\nthe superintendent; and lastly we must record that one wing of the\r\nasylum was burned, involving the deaths of patients and the destruction\r\nof much that it was with good reason believed the authorities wished to\r\nconceal.\r\n\r\nOf the revelations made by the Committee of the House of Commons in\r\nregard to Bethlem Hospital, we shall only briefly speak. We have already\r\nsketched the history of this institution. For the most part it is to the\r\n_second_ Bethlem--that in Moorfields--the minutes of evidence refer.\r\nDuring the seven years prior to the investigation, the number of\r\npatients averaged 238; the annual expenditure, L12,000. Mr. Haslam, the\r\nresident apothecary, ruled supreme. He was responsible for the dreadful\r\ncondition in which the notorious Norris was discovered. \"There is,\" says\r\nSydney Smith, \"much evasive testimony, to shift from himself the burden\r\nof this atrocious case; but his efforts tend rather to confirm than to\r\nshake the conviction which the evidence produces.... The conduct of\r\nHaslam with respect to several other patients was of a corresponding\r\ndescription; and in the case of a gentleman whose death was evidently\r\naccelerated by the severities he underwent, and of several other\r\npersons, there is abundant proof of cruelty.... It is in proof that a\r\npatient actually died, through mere neglect, from the bursting of the\r\nintestines, overloaded for want of aperient medicine, and it is\r\nexpressly stated by Haslam himself that a person whom he asserts to have\r\nbeen '_generally insane and mostly drunk_,' whose condition, in short,\r\nwas such 'that his hand was not obedient to his will,' was nevertheless\r\nretained in the office of Surgeon, and continued to attend the patients\r\nfor a period of _ten years_--a statement so atrocious that, from any\r\nother quarter, we should have rejected it as utterly incredible.\"[145]\r\n\r\nThe governors easily convinced themselves that no foundation whatever\r\nexisted for the charge of cruelty and bad management; that every degree\r\nof permissible indulgence had been observed; that the hospital was\r\nequal, if not superior, to any other asylum in England; that the mode of\r\nconfining the unhappy Norris appeared \"to have been, upon the whole,\r\nrather a merciful and humane, than a rigorous and severe imposition;\" in\r\nshort, that \"the general management of Bethlem, as affecting the health,\r\nthe cleanliness, and the comfort of the patients, was of a nature\r\n_creditable to the governors and others concerned in its\r\nadministration_.\" What a picture of the standard of excellence held by\r\nthe managers of asylums at that period, not in Bethlem alone, but\r\ngenerally!\r\n\r\nTo the question, \"Has there not been a rule in the hospital, for a\r\ncertain number of years, that, in certain months of the year,\r\nparticular classes of the patients should be physicked, bled, bathed,\r\nand vomited, at given periods?\" the reply from Bethlem was in the\r\naffirmative. Twice in the year the patients, with few exceptions, were\r\nbled. \"After they have been bled,\" said the physician, in evidence,\r\n\"they take vomits once a week for a certain number of weeks; after that,\r\nwe purge the patients. That has been the practice, invariably, for\r\nyears--long before my time.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the means of coercion employed, it was stated that the\r\npatients \"are generally chained to the wall with manacles.\" When inquiry\r\nwas made regarding the use of strait waistcoats, it was replied, \"I do\r\nnot believe there are any strait waistcoats in Bethlem now, or very few\r\nindeed; they generally use irons.\" The objection to strait waistcoats\r\nwas, that the patients \"could not help themselves in strait waistcoats;\r\nthey are so excessively long in the hospital without being seen by\r\nanybody, in a dark place; in winter, from four o'clock to six or seven\r\nin the morning. If they were in a strait waistcoat they could not assist\r\nthemselves the least in the world.\" When, in the following year, the\r\nhead-keeper of Bethlem Hospital was asked, \"Was it not the practice in\r\nold Bethlem--not in the late gallery, but in the gallery pulled\r\ndown--for eight, ten, or more patients to be fastened to the tables,\r\nalmost in a state of perfect nakedness?\" he replied, \"Yes; they used to\r\nthink they tore their clothes all to pieces; some of them would do\r\nthat.\" \"In point of fact, were they not fastened to the tables, sitting\r\nin a state of perfect nudity?\" Answer: \"They used to be so at the\r\ntable; they were chained all round.\" In regard to the apparatus, so\r\ningeniously cruel, by which one of the patients (Norris) was chained ten\r\nor twelve years, Haslam, the apothecary at Bethlem, when asked, \"Do you\r\nthink that his confinement in that manner during the whole of that\r\nperiod was necessary?\" replied, \"Decidedly.\"\r\n\r\nThe matron of Bethlem Hospital (who was elected January, 1815) gave\r\nevidence that, when she was appointed, there were about twenty patients\r\nunder personal restraint, out of between fifty and sixty patients. \"The\r\ncustom when I first went was only to get them up three days of the\r\nweek--never on meat days; they lie in bed four days in the week.\" She\r\nalso stated that one of the female patients had been chained for eight\r\nyears, but had not required restraint since she had been there.\r\n\r\nBethlem, however, was far from being the only place where patients were\r\ntreated like wild beasts. Mrs. Mary Humieres, formerly housekeeper in a\r\nprivate asylum at Bethnal Green, gave evidence to an attendant \"kicking\r\nthe patients and thumping them sadly,\" and \"beating one in his shirt\r\nwith a pair of boots, in a most dreadful manner.\" She named a female\r\npatient who, when in a state of irritation, \"was confined in a place in\r\nthe yard which was originally a pig-sty; it was run up high on purpose\r\nfor her. I have seen her confined there for three weeks together. She\r\nhas been ironed there in the crib with wrist-locks, and leg-locks, and a\r\nchain two or three times across her body.\" An iron bar was placed\r\nbetween her legs when she walked about, to prevent her escaping. \"It\r\nwas confined to each ankle, with a chain coming up between her legs,\r\nwhich was attached to her handcuffs.\" But, in addition to this frightful\r\nrestraint, we are informed that an attendant, at the instance of the\r\nproprietor, would, \"at sundry times,\" lock her down in her crib with\r\nwrist-locks and leg-locks, and horsewhip her. \"I have seen the blood\r\nfollow the strokes.\" Yet this patient is described as very harmless;\r\n\"you might sit and talk to her when she was in the highest state.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee found that at a private asylum--Fonthill, Wilts--there was\r\nin that year, out of fourteen patients, only one without fetters or\r\nhandcuffs, and only three out of their sleeping-rooms.[146]\r\n\r\nAt the Bethnal Green Asylum \"several of the pauper women were chained to\r\ntheir bedsteads, naked, and only covered with a hempen rug,\" and \"the\r\naccommodation for paupers was infamously bad, and required immediate\r\nreform;\" while in January of the same year it is reported that \"some\r\npauper men were chained upon their straw beds with only a rug to cover\r\nthem, and not in any way defended from the external cold.\"[147]\r\n\r\nDr. John Weir was asked, at the Committee of 1815, to what he\r\nattributed the difference of opinion among even enlightened men as to\r\nthe management of the insane. He replied that it was chiefly due to the\r\nwant of practical observation, as it is only by comparison that we are\r\nenabled to appreciate the superiority of one institution over another.\r\nHe added that, until within the last eighteen years, the primary object\r\nof almost every insane institution, whether of a public or private\r\ndescription, had been merely the security of these pitiable objects;\r\ncomfort, medical and moral treatment, had been in a great measure\r\noverlooked. \"Happily, however, for that class of society, the Retreat at\r\nYork had at last convinced the world how much may be done towards the\r\namelioration of their condition.\"[148]\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of July, 1815, Mr. Rose brought up the Report of this\r\nCommittee. On moving that it be printed, he said that all who read the\r\nReport must feel satisfied of the indispensable necessity of legislative\r\ninterference. The way in which lunatics were usually confined was that\r\nof criminals, and their treatment was in general worse than the ordinary\r\ntreatment in jails. The number of persons appointed to take care of them\r\nwas in most cases utterly insufficient, in consequence of which the\r\ngreatest severity was too frequently resorted to.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions arrived at in this celebrated Report may be thus\r\nsummarized: That keepers of houses for the insane received a much\r\ngreater number of persons than they were calculated for, thus greatly\r\nretarding their recovery; that the number of attendants being\r\ninsufficient, there was unavoidably a larger amount of restraint than\r\nwould otherwise be necessary; that outrageous patients were mixed with\r\nthe quiet and inoffensive; that there was an absence of medical\r\nattention to the malady for which the patients were confined; that the\r\ncertificates on which patients were received into asylums were\r\ninsufficient, and that the visitation of private mad-houses was\r\ndefective.\r\n\r\nThe Report concluded that \"some new provision of law is indispensably\r\nnecessary for ensuring better care being taken of insane persons, both\r\nin England and Ireland, than they have hitherto experienced; the number\r\nof whom appear to be very considerable, as the inquiries of the\r\nCommittee have convinced them that there are not in the country a set of\r\nbeings more immediately requiring the protection of the legislature than\r\nthe persons in this state, a very large proportion of whom are entirely\r\nneglected by their relatives and friends. If the treatment of those in\r\nthe middling or in the lower classes of life shut up in hospitals,\r\nprivate mad-houses, or parish workhouses, is looked at, your Committee\r\nare persuaded that a case cannot be found where the necessity for a\r\nremedy is more urgent.\"\r\n\r\nThe evidence taken before the Committee of 1815 was so full and\r\nconvincing that it would have seemed wholly unnecessary to have required\r\na further disclosure of the abuses rampant in the asylums of England,\r\nbut in consequence of the demand for further investigation before the\r\nHouse of Commons committed itself to legislation, a mass of further\r\nparticulars was obtained in 1816 in regard to the state of various\r\ninstitutions, including Bethlem Hospital and the York Asylum.\r\n\r\nIn February Mr. Rose had said in the House that, as chairman of the\r\nCommittee for inquiry into the conduct of mad-houses, he was instructed\r\nto move for leave to bring in a Bill for the better regulation of such\r\nestablishments. But some gentlemen of the Committee being desirous that\r\nfurther investigation should take place, he had acceded to their wish,\r\nalthough the majority concurred with him in thinking that sufficient\r\nevidence had already been adduced to justify the proposal of a Bill.\r\nTherefore, he should propose, instead of a Bill, that a Committee be\r\nappointed to consider of provision being made for the better regulation\r\nof mad-houses in England, and report the same, with their observations\r\nthereupon, to the House.\r\n\r\nOn May 28th Mr. Rose brought up the Report of the Committee, and\r\nobtained leave to bring in a Bill pursuant thereto. This Bill was for\r\nthe repeal of the 14th and 55th of the King. He said[149] the Committee\r\nhad, after the most patient investigation, adopted the provisions of the\r\npresent Bill, which principally were, that instead of the physicians of\r\nthe neighbourhood, or those in or near the metropolis, together with a\r\nneighbouring magistrate, being the inspectors of such establishments,\r\nthey should be twice a year examined, etc., by eight Commissioners\r\nappointed by the Secretary of State for the Home Department throughout\r\nthe kingdom; the Commissioners to be assisted by two of the local\r\nmagistrates in each district, and with equal powers. There was also a\r\nprovision in the Bill relative to the erection of lunatic asylums in\r\ncounties, and the ordering the reception therein of pauper lunatics\r\nallowed at present to range abroad, to their own and the public injury.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of June, Mr. Rose moved that the clauses of this Bill be\r\ntaken into further consideration. Lord R. Seymour observed that when\r\nParliament in 1774 passed the \"Bill for the Regulation of Licensed\r\nMad-houses,\" it must have meant to do three things: (1) To secure all\r\npersons against unnecessary confinement; (2) to better the chance of\r\nrecovery of all such persons confined as being insane, as well by moral\r\ntreatment as by the use of medicine; and (3) to insure the restoration\r\nof all who might become again of sound mind to society. But the\r\nMad-house Act, he said, does none of these three things, for it does not\r\nempower the Commissioners to discharge a patient, however sound in mind;\r\nnor does it furnish them with the means of enforcing the observance of\r\nany improvement they may recommend. The Commissioners, indeed, may\r\nwithdraw the licence, but the keeper of such a house must again have it\r\non the next licensing day, if he wishes, upon giving the necessary\r\nsecurity. It was not surprising, therefore, that the greatest abuses\r\nshould have been found to prevail.\r\n\r\nMr. Wynn expressed a wish that magistrates should be empowered to\r\nexamine houses where only one patient was confined.[150]\r\n\r\nThis Bill passed the House, but was rejected by the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThus all the mass of valuable and decisive evidence which had been\r\ncollected with so much labour, and had occupied the time and thought of\r\ntwo Committees of the House of Commons, was, for the time, thrown away,\r\nand the misery of the inmates of asylums allowed to go unrelieved. The\r\nfacts, however, had been made widely known. The inertia, torpor, and\r\nindifference to human suffering--in short, the crime which characterized\r\nthe majorities who threw out the Bills calculated to remove the abuses\r\nin asylums, had at last to give way to the popular demand. What was\r\ngained by prolonging the dismal condition of these abodes of woe for\r\nsome years longer, I leave others to discover.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of three years, namely, on the 10th of March, 1819, Mr.\r\nWynn[151] rose to move for leave to bring in a \"Bill for the Regulation\r\nof Mad-houses,\" and observed that, as this subject had been already\r\nseveral times before the House, he did not feel it necessary to trespass\r\nlong upon its attention. It would be remembered, he said, that some\r\nyears ago the Report of a Committee had been laid before the House,\r\ndetailing such scenes of misery and wretchedness in mad-houses, as had\r\nperhaps never been paralleled, and after such an exposure it was the\r\nobvious duty of the House to follow up the Report by the adoption of\r\nsome legislative measure calculated to put an end to the evils\r\ncomplained of. There was, however, no fault to be found with the\r\nconduct of that House; for it had done its duty by repeatedly sending up\r\na Bill to the other House, which it had thought proper to reject.\r\nAlthough no mad-houses could be legally opened without a licence, the\r\nCollege of Physicians was not in possession of funds to prosecute. He\r\ntherefore proposed that a general Board of Inspection for mad-houses\r\nshould be appointed, and that the members of that Board should be at\r\nliberty to visit such houses throughout the country, at different and\r\nuncertain times, so as to ascertain the manner in which they were\r\nconducted, and to report any existing evil to the Board, which should be\r\ninvested with power to enforce their correction. Mr. Wynn moved for\r\nleave to bring in a Bill for repealing the Act of the 14th and 55th of\r\nthe King with respect to mad-houses, and for making other provisions for\r\ntheir better regulation.[152]\r\n\r\nLeave was given to bring in the Bill.\r\n\r\nIn June of the same year the Marquis of Lansdowne, speaking on the Bill\r\nin the House of Lords, said that nothing could more forcibly appeal to\r\nthe humanity of their lordships than the state of the unfortunate\r\ninsane, and the legislative means of preventing abuses of the most\r\nflagrant and revolting nature, which had long been too clearly proved.\r\nStrange to say, however, the Lord Chancellor (Lord Eldon) opposed the\r\nBill, observing that there could not be a more false humanity than an\r\nover-humanity with regard to persons afflicted with insanity. (Is not an\r\nunder-humanity nearly as false?) He admitted there were great abuses,\r\nbut the better way to remedy them would be to take a cool and\r\ndispassionate view of the subject in a Committee, next session. As if\r\nthere had not been Committees enough! With regard to pauper lunatics,\r\nthe Lord Chancellor went so far as not only to admit there were great\r\nabuses, but to agree to a short Bill, if desired, embodying the clauses\r\nrelating to them in the measure before the House.\r\n\r\nThe Bill was thrown out, only fourteen doing themselves the credit of\r\nvoting in its favour, while thirty-five voted against it. Majority\r\nagainst the Bill, twenty-one.\r\n\r\nAn \"Act for making Provision for the Better Care of Pauper Lunatics in\r\nEngland\"[153] was, however, passed (July 12, 1819), but it consisted of\r\nthree sections only, and does not appear to be an advance, in any\r\nessential particular, upon previous Acts. The form of the medical\r\ncertificate for a pauper lunatic is prescribed.[154] Again, the Act is\r\npermissive as regards the action of the justices in causing the\r\noverseers to bring the lunatic before them, and calling in a medical man\r\nto their assistance.\r\n\r\nFour years afterwards, on June 30, 1823, the subject of private\r\nmad-houses again came before the House. A petition from John Mitford for\r\nan inquiry into the state of private mad-houses was ordered to lie on\r\nthe table. Mr. Wynn, as on a former occasion, spoke, and observed that\r\nthree Bills had, at recent periods, been sent up from that House to the\r\nLords, relative to the inspection of houses of this description. He\r\nregretted to say they had not been passed. It is extraordinary that Mr.\r\nWynn should have ended his speech by saying that, although he believed\r\nabuses might exist in some of these establishments, they were on the\r\nwhole well conducted. Mr. (afterwards Lord) Brougham said that he knew\r\nDr. Warburton, against whom charges had been brought, and that his\r\ncharacter stood equally high both for medical skill and for humanity!\r\n\r\nWriting in 1827, Sir Andrew Halliday[155] says, \"The evidence taken\r\nbefore Mr. Rose's Committee, which sat for more than one session, must\r\nbe fresh in the recollection of every one of my readers.... He was at\r\ngreat pains to prepare a Bill which, in the opinion of all who had heard\r\nthe evidence, and had taken a disinterested part in the investigation,\r\nwas well calculated to remedy every evil either ascertained or\r\nanticipated. The subject was dispassionately canvassed in the Lower\r\nHouse, and the Bill passed by the Commons, almost unanimously, three or\r\nfour several times; but it was uniformly rejected by the Lords, and\r\nafter Mr. Rose's death it got into Chancery, and there it has slept for\r\nthe last _nine years_. I do not mean this remark in any manner as a\r\njest; for, literally and truly, the late Lord Chancellor [Lord Eldon]\r\ntook the whole matter upon his own shoulders, and promised to prepare a\r\nmeasure more suited to the exigencies of the sufferers than any that the\r\ncollected wisdom of the Commons of England, in Parliament assembled,\r\ncould think or devise.... The House of Commons has again taken up the\r\nmatter, and I trust they will not abandon it, even though they should be\r\nopposed, until some provision is made against the recurrence of those\r\nevils, very trifling in comparison of former times, which during their\r\nlast short inquiry were found still to exist.\" Sir A. Halliday points\r\nout that, although twenty years had elapsed since Mr. Wynn's Act passed\r\n(having received subsequently several amendments), asylums had only been\r\nopened in the counties of York (Wakefield, 1818), Lancaster (1816),\r\nNottingham (1812), Norfolk (1814), Stafford (1818), Bedford (1812),\r\nGloucester (1823), Lincoln (1820), and Cornwall (1820)--nine out of the\r\nfifty-two counties of England and Wales. Suffolk had just finished its\r\nbuilding, as had Chester a short time before. Only at that very time had\r\nthe magistrates of Middlesex, after two years' deliberation, announced\r\nthat a county asylum was necessary, although it had been proved by Lord\r\nR. Seymour that 873 persons were suffering neglect and cruel treatment\r\nfor want of it!\r\n\r\nReturns ordered by Parliament in 1826 show that there were 1321 persons\r\nin private asylums, exclusive of those in London and within a radius of\r\nseven miles; 1147 in public asylums, exclusive of those in St. Luke's\r\nand Bethlem; and 53 in public jails; giving a total of 2521 for the\r\nseveral counties of England and Wales. Those in private asylums in and\r\nnear London being estimated at 1761, and the asylums of St. Luke's and\r\nBethlem at 500, the gross total for England and Wales was 4782. Sir\r\nAndrew Halliday did not hesitate to assert, after very careful inquiry,\r\nthat the number actually in confinement, not only in the asylums, but\r\nwith relations and keepers, exceeded 8000. He thought there were very\r\nfew in Wales, or in \"the Celtic tribes in other portions of the\r\nempire.\"[156]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Halliday, I may add that he regarded Bethlem as, at this\r\nperiod, well conducted, but as having \"too much of the leaven of the\r\ndark ages in its constitution, and too rigid a system of quackery, in\r\nregard to its being seen and visited by respectable strangers.\" He adds\r\nthat in some respects \"it is little better than when, in fact, it formed\r\none of the _lions_ of the metropolis, and the patients as wild beasts\r\nwere shown at sixpence for each person admitted.\" Of St. Luke's he\r\nwrites, \"It is only fit to become a prison for confirmed idiots.\" He\r\nwould have been surprised to witness how much can be effected by\r\nimprovements of various kinds, although he might still wish that it\r\nwere supplemented by some appendage in the country, if not removed there\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nA very important step was taken by Mr. R. Gordon in the House of Commons\r\nin 1827 (June 13th), by drawing attention to the pauper lunatics in\r\nMiddlesex. He particularly referred to the dreadful state of misery of\r\nthe pauper lunatics in London in the parishes of Marylebone and St.\r\nGeorge's. When the overseers of the latter parish visited Dr.\r\nWarburton's asylum at Bethnal Green, they found, he said, in a room\r\neighteen feet long, sixteen cribs,[157] with a patient in each crib,\r\nsome of them chained and fastened down, and all of them in a state of\r\ngreat wretchedness. On one occasion, a visitor having gone there and\r\nreported that there was nothing objectionable, he repeated his visit\r\nnext day, and discovered five rooms, in which the patients were in a\r\nmost horrid state of misery; and this although the day before he was\r\ninformed that he had seen everything. The unfortunate persons placed in\r\nthese cribs were kept from Saturday night until Monday; their food being\r\nadministered to them in the cribs. Mr. Gordon moved for a Select\r\nCommittee to inquire into the condition of pauper lunatics in Middlesex,\r\nand for leave to bring in a Bill to amend 14 Geo. III. c. 49\r\n(1774),[158] and to extend its provisions to pauper lunatics, to\r\nconsolidate all Acts relative to lunatics and asylums, and to make\r\nfurther provisions thereto.\r\n\r\nThe Committee was appointed.\r\n\r\nIt specially directed its attention to the treatment of paupers in the\r\nparishes of Marylebone, St. George, Hanover Square, and St. Pancras,\r\nconfined in the White House at Bethnal Green, belonging to Dr.\r\nWarburton. Its condition was frightful, and the Committee observes that\r\nif the White House is to be taken as a fair specimen of similar\r\nestablishments, it cannot too strongly or too anxiously express its\r\nconviction that the greatest possible benefit will accrue to pauper\r\npatients by the erection of a county lunatic asylum.\r\n\r\nThe Committee reports that the defects and abuses in the management of\r\nhouses for the reception of lunatics, to which the Select Committee of\r\n1815 called the attention of the House of Commons, still exist in\r\nlicensed houses where paupers are received in the neighbourhood of the\r\nmetropolis, and that similar abuses elsewhere prevail. The evidence\r\nestablished that there was no due precaution with respect to the\r\ncertificate of admission, the consideration of discharge, or the\r\napplication of any curative process to the mental malady. The Committee\r\ntherefore repeated the recommendations of the Committees of 1807 and\r\n1815, and prepared a series of propositions as the basis of future\r\nlegislation, repealing a number of Acts and recommending the\r\nconsolidation, into one Act of Parliament, of the provisions for the\r\ninsane, as well as further facilitating the erection of county asylums,\r\nand improving the treatment of pauper and criminal lunatics.\r\n\r\nDr. John Bright, secretary to the Commissioners, read from their records\r\none entry, describing the condition of Holt's house, Lewisham, in Kent.\r\nIn the year 1820, \"in a close room in the yard, two men were shut by an\r\nexternal bolt, and the room was remarkably close and offensive. In an\r\nouthouse at the bottom of the yard, ventilated only by cracks in the\r\nwall, were enclosed three females. The door was padlocked; upon an open\r\nrail-bottomed crib herein, without straw, was chained a female by the\r\nwrists, arms, and legs, and fixed also by chains to the crib. Her wrists\r\nwere blistered by the handcuffs; she was covered only by a rug. The only\r\nattendant upon all the lunatics appeared to be one female servant, who\r\nstated that she was helped by the patients.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequent entries did not show any material improvement in the\r\ncondition of the house.\r\n\r\nDr. Bright summarized the defects in the Lunacy Laws at that period, as\r\nregards the power vested in the Commissioners, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"They are very defective in many points: in the first place, with\r\nrespect to the granting licences, there is only one day in the year in\r\nwhich, according to the Act, the licences can be granted; then with\r\nrespect to persons to whom the licence may be granted, any person\r\napplying for that licence is entitled to have one; again, any person\r\ncommitting any offence, save and except the refusing admission to\r\nCommissioners on their visitations, may be continued and is continued in\r\nthe exercise of such powers as that licence communicates to him; the\r\nCommissioners have no power to disturb in the management of his house\r\nany keeper of a house, whatever offences he may have committed, or\r\nhowever unworthy he may appear to them to be. Supposing any person who\r\nhad, in the eyes of the Commissioners, acted improperly, to apply in\r\nOctober, at the usual and the only period in the year for granting\r\nlicences, they conceive (and they are advised) that they are obliged to\r\ngrant a licence to that individual. There is another circumstance which\r\nI think is very important, which is the certificate which is granted;\r\nthe Act is vague with respect to the medical person. It speaks of him as\r\nphysician, surgeon, or apothecary; it does not say 'duly authorized to\r\ngrant a licence,' and, in point of fact, a number of persons, calling\r\nthemselves apothecaries, do sign certificates, and the Commissioners do\r\nnot believe that they can prevent them so doing, or that the signature\r\nis invalid; and, again, it often happens, and very improperly, as the\r\nCommissioners think, that persons sign the certificate in two\r\ncapacities. For instance, a medical man is, or calls himself, the friend\r\nof the person conveyed to the mad-house, and he signs again as a medical\r\nperson; again, the keeper of a mad-house, who happens to be a medical\r\nperson, signs a certificate, attesting the insanity of the party, and\r\nreceiving that party into his house. The Commissioners always reprobate\r\nand endeavour to check such a practice, but not always successfully.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following year (February 19, 1828) Mr. Gordon, in pursuance of\r\nthe instructions of the Committee, brought in a Bill to amend the law\r\nfor the regulation of lunatic asylums. He said, among other things, that\r\nthe medical certificate to be signed by an apothecary was interpreted to\r\nmean that it might be signed by any seller of drugs, and hence an\r\napprentice, as soon as his indentures had expired, might consign a man\r\nto a mad-house. This reminds me of a mistake into which a distinguished\r\nGerman alienist has recently fallen, not unnaturally, from our double\r\nuse of the word apothecary. He smiles at the absurdity of the British\r\nlaw allowing a mere druggist to sign a certificate of insanity! Mr.\r\nGordon again refers to Dr. Warburton's house, and the patients in their\r\ncribs \"wallowing in their filth throughout the whole of Sunday,\" while\r\non Monday morning they were \"in a state of nudity, covered with sores\r\nand ordure, and were carried into the yard to be suddenly plunged into\r\ncold water, even when ice was in the pails.\" The speaker added that it\r\nwas impossible, with the strongest language, to describe the horrors of\r\nthis place, and even maintained that the evidence before the Committee\r\nshowed that, however bad, this house was good as compared with others of\r\nthe same kind--if not much better than many of them.\r\n\r\nHe maintained that, unfortunately, the provision made by 14 Geo. III.,\r\nc. 49, by which five Commissioners, appointed by the College of\r\nPhysicians, licensed and were bound to visit these houses yearly, and,\r\nif they found anything improper, were directed to state to the College\r\nwhat they had discovered, had never been attended to in practice; at\r\nleast, since 1800. The excuse for this negligence was that the complaint\r\nto the College censors (placed on a card in their room) did no good, and\r\nmight therefore as well be abandoned. In fact, he found on inquiry that\r\nthe Commissioners had done nothing--literally and strictly nothing. He\r\nthen referred to a house where two patients were found lying in an\r\nouthouse, and three others chained down by the arms, wrists, and legs.\r\nTheir wrists were blistered, and their persons covered only by rags.\r\nThis was within five miles of London. He concluded by moving for leave\r\nto bring in a Bill \"To Consolidate and Amend the several Acts respecting\r\nCounty Lunatic Asylums, and to Improve the Treatment of Pauper and\r\nCriminal Lunatics.\"\r\n\r\nLord Ashley seconded the motion, and leave was given to bring in the\r\nBill,[159] which passed the House.\r\n\r\nIn the Upper House Lord Malmesbury moved the second reading of the above\r\nBill. One object, he said, of the Lunatic Asylum Regulation Bill was to\r\ngive to counties more power in establishing asylums. For private\r\npatients, two medical certificates and an order would now be required,\r\nand the like for single patients. In regard to the existing College\r\nCommissioners, he ridiculed the extraordinary circumstance that if, in\r\nthe course of their visits of inspection, they found what was\r\nreprehensible in an asylum, they could not revoke the licence which they\r\nthemselves had given. It was proposed to take the power from the College\r\nof Physicians and invest it in fifteen Metropolitan Commissioners\r\nappointed by the Home Secretary.[160]\r\n\r\nThis Act (9 Geo. IV., c. 40), based on the Report of the Committee, was\r\npassed July 15, 1828.[161]\r\n\r\nThe returns of pauper lunatics in England and Wales amounted to 9000,\r\nbeing 6700 in excess of the corresponding return of 1807; but nobody\r\nsupposes that there had been that, or, in fact, any considerable\r\nincrease in the number of the insane poor, but simply greater accuracy\r\nin obtaining statistics.\r\n\r\nReferring back to this period, Lord Shaftesbury, in evidence given\r\nbefore a Committee of the House of Commons thirty years later, and\r\ndwelling upon the old _regime_, observed: \"I mention these things\r\nbecause they never could be seen now (1859), and I think that those who\r\ncome after us ought to know what things have existed within the memory\r\nof man. At the present time, when people go into an asylum, they see\r\neverything cleanly, orderly, decent, and quiet, and a great number of\r\npersons in this later generation cannot believe there was ever anything\r\nterrible in the management of insanity; and many say, 'After all, a\r\nlunatic asylum is not so terrible as I believed.' When we begun our\r\nvisitations, one of the first rooms that we went into contained nearly a\r\nhundred and fifty patients, in every form of madness, a large\r\nproportion of them chained to the wall, some melancholy, some furious,\r\nbut the noise and din and roar were such that we positively could not\r\nhear each other; every form of disease and every form of madness was\r\nthere; I never beheld anything so horrible and so miserable. Turning\r\nfrom that room, we went into a court, appropriated to the women. In that\r\ncourt there were from fifteen to twenty women, whose sole dress was a\r\npiece of red cloth, tied round the waist with a rope; many of them with\r\nlong beards, covered with filth; they were crawling on their knees, and\r\nthat was the only place where they could be. I do not think that I ever\r\nwitnessed brute beasts in such a condition, and this had subsisted for\r\nyears, and no remedy could be applied to it. It was known to one or two\r\nphysicians at the Royal College, who visited the place once a year; but\r\nthey said, fairly enough, that, although they saw these things, they\r\ncould not amend them.\" Lord Shaftesbury, after giving a short _resume_\r\nof the condition of the old York Asylum, as well as of that of Bethnal\r\nGreen in 1827, went on to observe--a paragraph which will form the motto\r\nof my work--\"I might multiply these instances almost indefinitely, but I\r\nthought it was desirable just to indicate the state of things that\r\nexisted, in order to contrast the Past with the Present.\"[162]\r\n\r\nIn the interval between the Act of 1828[163] and the next Act of\r\nimportance, several attempts were made at further legislation on the\r\npart of Mr. Gordon and Lord Somerset. A Bill passed both Houses in\r\n1832.[164] In one instance a Bill which passed the Commons was\r\ncharacterized in the House of Lords as \"one of the most abominable\r\npieces of legislation that ever was seen.\" It was \"monstrous.\" \"Their\r\nlordships could never suffer such an abominable piece of legislation to\r\nbe thrust down their throats.\" It is scarcely necessary to say that the\r\nlips from which this animated language proceeded were those of Henry\r\nBrougham, then the Lord Chancellor. The Bill was, of course, rejected.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Lord Somerset brought forward a motion on the inspection of\r\nasylums, and pointed out that there was a very large class of persons to\r\nwhose inspection the Act of 1828 did not apply, viz. those in\r\nconfinement in their own houses, in separate lodgings, in public\r\ninstitutions, as county asylums, and the hospitals of Bethlem and St.\r\nLuke's. The object of his Bill was to extend the system of inspection in\r\nforce in the metropolitan licensed asylums to the provinces. Barristers,\r\nhe maintained, should be appointed, with a fixed salary, and not paid\r\nfor their hour's work and allowed to practise. It is worthy of record\r\nthat the returns at this period showed that there were about sixty or\r\nseventy houses licensed for the reception of insane persons in the\r\ncountry, and that there were actually twenty-five counties in England\r\nwhere there was not a single asylum licensed for the reception of\r\nlunatics, and not one in Wales.\r\n\r\nThis measure was characterized by Mr. Wakley as not only a very small\r\none, but as an insult to medical men, as it only proposed barristers as\r\nthe new Commissioners, adding that \"in Scotland there was one system, in\r\nIreland there was another, and in England there were several, and among\r\nthem all there was not one which, on the whole, was entitled to the\r\nsanction and approbation of the public, or which was worthy of the\r\nadoption of the noble lord [Somerset].\"\r\n\r\nLord Ashley approved of the Bill, and speaking of the work of the\r\nCommissioners, he said, \"They have aimed at a medium line of policy, and\r\nan immense amount of human misery had been abated under the present law,\r\nand by the industry of those who carry it into execution.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this speech that Lord Ashley made an observation which has not\r\nescaped the criticism of the medical profession, namely, \"that a man of\r\ncommon sense could give as good an opinion as any medical man he ever\r\nknew,\" that is, \"when it has been once established that the insanity of\r\na patient did not arise from the state of his bodily health.\"[165]\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that Mr. Wakley moved an amendment on the first\r\nclause of the Bill, omitting \"Barrister Commissioners,\" and inserting\r\n\"Medical Commissioners.\" He spoke of the total failure of the\r\nMetropolitan Commission, and ultimately moved as an amendment that two\r\nof the Commissioners to be appointed should not have their profession\r\nstated, their appointment being left to the Lord Chancellor. This\r\namendment was carried by a majority of three, but in the Bill provision\r\nwas made for two more physicians and two more barristers.\r\n\r\nOn July 16th of the same year, on the motion that the order of the day\r\nfor the further consideration of the Lunatic Asylums Bill be proceeded\r\nwith, a member suggested its postponement until further discussion. Lord\r\nSomerset replied that the Bill was framed for the purpose of procuring\r\nfurther information on the subject, in order to legislate permanently\r\nupon it. On the House going into Committee Lord Ashley expressed a hope\r\nthat the measure would tend to ameliorate the condition of the pauper\r\nlunatics throughout the kingdom. On this occasion Lord Ashley observed,\r\nin regard to the system of non-restraint, that he had formerly\r\nentertained some doubts as to the practicability of carrying it out; but\r\nthat these doubts had been removed by a visit to the Hanwell Asylum.\r\nHaving witnessed the system pursued there, he said he could not speak\r\ntoo highly either of the system itself, or the manner in which it was\r\ncarried out by Dr. Conolly.\r\n\r\nHaving passed through Committee, the Bill was read a third time on the\r\n28th of July, 1842, and in this instance was not rejected by the House\r\nof Lords.[166]\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Commissioners, invested with their enlarged powers,\r\nmade a most thorough inquiry into the condition of the asylums in\r\nEngland and Wales, and presented a Report to Parliament in 1844, which\r\nmust always possess great historic interest and value.[167] It\r\nconstitutes the Doomsday Book of all that concerns institutions for the\r\ninsane at that time.\r\n\r\nThe state of some asylums visited by the Commissioners was frightfully\r\nbad, notwithstanding the general progress which had been made since\r\npublic attention had been directed to abuses and the several Acts of\r\nParliament had been passed in order to remove them. These things,\r\nhowever, it must be remembered, were survivals of the past, not fair\r\nillustrations of the present; abuses which lingered on in spite of light\r\nand knowledge, and required stringent pains and penalties to force those\r\nwho permitted them to abandon their practices.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of July, 1844, the indefatigable reformer of abuses\r\nconnected with the treatment of lunatics, Lord Ashley, moved for an\r\nAddress to the Crown, praying her Majesty to take into consideration the\r\nReport of the Metropolitan Commissioners in Lunacy[168] to the Lord\r\nChancellor, presented to the House, the statute under which they acted\r\nexpiring next session. He commented upon there being no official\r\nvisitation of single houses. He believed that such a power \"ought to be\r\nconfided to some hand that would hunt out and expose the many horrible\r\nabuses that at present prevail.\" The only control was that if such\r\npatient resided more than twelve months in a house, the owner was\r\ncompelled to communicate the name of that patient to the clerk of the\r\nCommission; but for the most part no notice was taken of this law, and\r\nit was frequently evaded by removing the patient, after a residence of\r\neleven months, to some other lodging.\r\n\r\nAt this period (January 1, 1844) the number of lunatics and idiots\r\nchargeable to unions and parishes in England and Wales was 16,821. In\r\ncounty asylums there was provision for only 4155, leaving 12,666 poor\r\ninsane, of whom there were in asylums under local Acts 89, in Bethlem\r\nand St. Luke's 121, in lunatic hospitals 343, while 2774 were in private\r\nasylums, leaving in workhouses and elsewhere 9339. Although a few of the\r\nexisting county asylums were well adapted to their purpose, and a very\r\nlarge proportion of them were extremely well conducted, yet some were\r\nquite unfit for the reception of insane persons. Some were placed in\r\nineligible sites, and others were deficient in the necessary means of\r\nproviding outdoor employment for their paupers. Some also were ill\r\ncontrived and defective in their internal construction and\r\naccommodation. Some afforded every advantage of science and treatment;\r\nothers were wholly deficient in these points. All of them, however, had\r\nthe advantage of constant supervision, and of not giving any profit to\r\nthe superintendent. Lord Ashley especially referred to the admirable\r\nmanner in which the asylums of Wakefield, Hanwell, Lincoln, Lancaster,\r\nand Gloucester were managed. \"Why, then,\" his lordship asked, \"are not\r\nthese institutions multiplied? At this moment there are twenty-one\r\ncounties in England and Wales without any asylum whatever, public or\r\nprivate. The expense is one cause. In some cases the cost of\r\nconstruction has been exceedingly great. The asylum most cheaply\r\nconstructed is that of Wakefield, of which the average cost per head was\r\nL111, whilst the highest price was that of Gloucester, which had cost on\r\nthe first accommodation L357 per head. In many cases the cost of\r\nconstruction had exceeded L200 per head. The cost of the Bedford Asylum,\r\nfor 180 patients, was L20,500; that of Gloucester, for 261 patients,\r\nL51,366; that of Kent, for 300 patients, was L64,056; that of Hanwell,\r\nfor 1000 patients, was L160,000, exclusive of L36,000 paid since 1835\r\nfor furniture and fittings. On the other hand, the best-constructed\r\nunion-houses in the country had not cost more than L40 per head.\" Lord\r\nAshley maintained that although, no doubt, a lunatic asylum was\r\nexpensive, it ought not to be so to that enormous degree. The reason of\r\nthis difference he did not know, except that many of them had been\r\nconstructed with a great display of architecture, and some asylums were\r\nfar too large. Adopting the opinion of the Report of the Commissioners,\r\nhe maintained that no asylum for _curable_ lunatics should contain more\r\nthan 250 patients, and that perhaps 200 are as large a number as can be\r\nmanaged with the most benefit to themselves and the public in one\r\nasylum; and he quoted Dr. Conolly's stronger statement that 100 persons\r\nwere the highest number that could be managed with convenience in one of\r\nthese asylums. With regard to the number of private patients in\r\nasylums, there were 3790, of whom 973 were in private metropolitan, and\r\n1426 in private provincial asylums. The paupers in the private houses\r\nwere--metropolitan, 854; provincial, 1920. With respect to these, it was\r\na very serious question how far any house should be licensed to take\r\npaupers for payment. The principle was very dangerous, and Lord Ashley\r\npointed out that if the superintendent only got seven or eight shillings\r\na week, he still must make a profit, and that there could be no doubt it\r\nwas so. Quoting the Report of the Commissioners again, he said that many\r\nasylums had formerly been private houses; the mansion was sometimes\r\nengrossed by the proprietor and a few private patients, while the\r\npaupers were consigned to buildings formerly used as offices and\r\nouthouses. After adducing evidence of the deplorable condition of\r\ncertain asylums, Lord Ashley asserted that the only remedy was the\r\nmultiplication of county asylums, and if advice and example failed, they\r\nought to appeal to the assistance of the law to compel the construction\r\nof an adequate number of asylums over the whole country. It was the duty\r\nof the State to provide receptacles for the incurable patients, apart\r\nfrom those devoted to remedial treatment. Parochial authorities,\r\nhowever, preferred keeping patients in the workhouse at an expense not\r\nexceeding two shillings a week, rather than send them to the county\r\nasylum, where the minimum charge was seven shillings a week.\r\n\r\nIt was true, Lord Ashley observed, that they could show but few\r\ninstances of restoration to reason. How, indeed, was it possible? They\r\ncould show, however, a mighty improvement in the condition of the\r\nsufferers, the alleviation of their state, their occupations and\r\namusements (all, with some bright exceptions, of recent date), and that\r\nthe services of religion had infused a momentary tranquillity; but they\r\ncould show little else, and unless the Legislature should interfere and\r\nbring these unfortunates by force within the reach of sympathy and care,\r\nfor every one restored to his senses we should see a hundred in whom the\r\nlight of reason would be extinguished for ever. The speaker went on to\r\nsay that there were two points of deep interest, to which the House\r\nwould do well to advert for a moment--the question of restraint, and the\r\nadmission and liberation of patients. \"Upon restraint it was unnecessary\r\nto dwell very long, as it was a matter of internal arrangement, and\r\nbeyond their immediate legislation; but he wished to direct the\r\nattention of the House to the chapter in the Report which handled that\r\nsubject, that it might share the general satisfaction, and give praise\r\nto those good and able men, Mr. Tuke, Dr. Hitch, Dr. Corsellis, Dr.\r\nConolly, Dr. de Vitre, Dr. Charlesworth and many more, who had brought\r\nall their high moral and intellectual qualities to bear on this topic,\r\nand had laboured to make rational and humane treatment to be the rule\r\nand principle of the government of lunacy.\"\r\n\r\nLord Ashley pointed out that the law required no medical certificate\r\nwhatever for a pauper patient, except when admitted into a private\r\nasylum. It appears that in Wales at that time there were 1177 pauper\r\nlunatics, 36 of whom were in English county asylums, and 41 in English\r\nlicensed houses, 90 in union workhouses, and 1010 living with their\r\nfriends, many of them being in a wretched condition. Lord Ashley quoted\r\na letter from one of the Commissioners, written in Wales, in which it\r\nwas stated, \"We have met with one case which we think most atrocious. A.\r\nB. was sent to the Hereford Asylum from near Brecon on November 28,\r\n1843. She died on January 30th. She was in such a shocking state that\r\nthe proprietor wished not to admit her; she had been kept chained in the\r\nhouse of a married daughter. From being long chained in a crouching\r\nposture, her knees were forced up to her chin, and she sat wholly upon\r\nher heels and her hips, and considerable excoriation had taken place\r\nwhere her knees pressed upon her stomach. She could move about, and was\r\ngenerally maniacal. When she died it required very considerable\r\ndissection to get her pressed into her coffin! This might be taken as a\r\nsample of Welsh lunatics.\"\r\n\r\nThe improvement in the condition of Dr. Warburton's asylum at Bethnal\r\nGreen, which was the original cause of the Commission of Inquiry being\r\nappointed in 1827, now presented, it appears, a most agreeable picture\r\nof what might be done by vigilant inspection. \"Whereas in 1828 there\r\nwere commonly 150 to 200 of the patients restrained by leg-locks,\r\nchains, and other fetters--certainly during the night--in 1844 there\r\nwere, out of 582 patients, only 5 whose violence rendered this species\r\nof restriction necessary, and even the confinement or coercion resorted\r\nto was of the most moderate description, and in the opinion of the\r\nvisiting officers most necessary.\"\r\n\r\nLord Ashley concluded his speech with the following eloquent\r\nwords:--\"Sir, these subjects may be dull, and want the light and shade\r\nof more exciting topics; but the expense which is incurred, the numbers\r\nthat suffer, and the nature of their sufferings, will perhaps justify\r\nthe present demand upon your time and patience. The House possesses the\r\nmeans of applying a real and speedy remedy; these unhappy persons are\r\noutcasts from all the social and domestic affections of private\r\nlife--nay, more, from all its cares and duties, and have no refuge but\r\nin the laws. You can prevent by the agency you shall appoint, as you\r\nhave in many instances prevented, the recurrence of frightful cruelties;\r\nyou can soothe the days of the incurable, and restore many sufferers to\r\nhealth and usefulness.... I trust, therefore, that I shall stand\r\nexcused, though I have consumed so much of your valuable time, when you\r\ncall to mind that the Motion is made on behalf of the most helpless, if\r\nnot the most afflicted, portion of the human race.\"[169]\r\n\r\nSir James Graham does not appear to have been affected by this appeal,\r\nfor, declining immediate action, he stated that the condition of pauper\r\nlunatics would come under the consideration of the House next session.\r\nHe recommended the House to approach the subject of the inspection of\r\nprivate houses with great caution.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1845 (June 6th) Lord Ashley returned to the subject,\r\nand brought forward in the House of Commons two Bills for England and\r\nWales only, although he said, \"I believe that not in any country in\r\nEurope, nor in any part of America, is there any place in which pauper\r\nlunatics are in such a suffering and degraded state as those in her\r\nMajesty's kingdom of Scotland.\" After pointing out that the then\r\nexisting law was embodied in nine statutes, divisible into four\r\nclasses--County Asylums, Licensed Asylums and Public Asylums, Persons\r\nfound lunatic by inquisition, and Criminal Lunatics, he observed that\r\nhis Bill only touched the two first classes, and amended the single Act\r\ncontained under the first class, as also the three Acts contained under\r\nthe second class, namely, 2 and 3 Will. IV., c. 107; 3 and 4 Will. IV.,\r\nc. 64; and 5 and 6 Vict., c. 87; which various statutes were proposed by\r\nhim to be consolidated into one--\"A Bill for the Regulation of the Care\r\nand Treatment of Lunatics in England and Wales.\" After referring to the\r\nstate of the law as it existed under 14 Geo. III., the only law\r\nregulating private asylums prior to Mr. Gordon's measure of 1828, Lord\r\nAshley proposed to establish a permanent Commission of Lunacy, giving\r\npower of far more detailed and frequent visitation than previously, and\r\nplacing \"hospitals\" under proper regulation by requiring them to have\r\nthe same orders and certificates as in licensed asylums, and the same\r\nvisitation as in county asylums. The person signing the order of a\r\npauper patient would be required to examine him beforehand, and the\r\nmedical officer certifying his insanity was to see him within seven\r\ndays of his confinement. On admission the mental and bodily condition of\r\nthe patient, and in the event of his death, the cause thereof, were to\r\nbe stated. Injuries and acts of violence were to be recorded and a\r\ncase-book kept. A return was to be made of all single patients received\r\nfor profit.[170] Workhouses containing lunatics were to be subjected to\r\nregular visitation. These were some of the provisions of the first Bill.\r\n\r\nThe second was an extension of the Act of 9 Geo. IV., c. 40, and was of\r\nthe highest importance, for the provision of county and borough asylums,\r\ninstead of being permissive, was made compulsory. Where insufficient\r\naccommodation had been provided, it was required to increase it. It was\r\nproposed to erect some separate buildings at less cost for incurable, or\r\nrather chronic, cases. The above Bill was to be extended to boroughs\r\nhaving separate quarter sessions, and to every place not contributing to\r\ncounty rates. All lunatics not chargeable, whether wandering or\r\notherwise, were to be apprehended, and those whose friends were unable\r\nto pay for them admitted as paupers. A quarterly inspection by a medical\r\nman of lunatics not in asylums was required, and a list was to be sent\r\nto the Commissioners in Lunacy.\r\n\r\nLord Ashley, after paying the tribute of respect and admiration due to\r\nPinel, referred in conclusion to the introduction of a humane system of\r\ntreatment into this country at York, adding that it must be grateful to\r\nthe feelings of the author of the \"Description of the Retreat\" \"to\r\nperceive that his example has obtained not only the approval, but the\r\nimitation of the best and wisest men of this country, and, I may add, of\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nLord Ashley's Bill introduced for the first time a permanent Lunacy\r\nCommission. It comprised six paid Commissioners at salaries of L1500\r\neach, which, he observed, would be economical in the end. In Mr.\r\nGordon's Act the Commissioners were appointed for one year, to be\r\nrenewed annually, and consisted of ten unpaid members and five\r\nphysicians, who were paid at the rate of one guinea an hour for their\r\nattendance, with power to carry into effect the new Act within the\r\nmetropolitan district. This act and the Commission were renewed in 1832,\r\nwhen two barristers were added on the same terms. In 1834, having been\r\nalways a member of the Commission, Lord Ashley became the chairman. The\r\nAct had been renewed periodically every three years until the year 1842,\r\nwhen Lord Somerset brought in a Bill, the object of which was greatly to\r\nextend the operation of the Metropolitan Commission. The number of\r\nphysicians was then augmented to seven, and the barristers to four; and\r\nit was also provided that the Commissioners should receive five guineas\r\na day during the performance of their duties in the provinces.\r\nImmediately after that Act (5 and 6 Vict., c. 87) the Commissioners had\r\nentered upon their enlarged duties. The consequence was that in each\r\nyear the establishments visited by them were:\r\n\r\n  Visited once\r\n    a year.\r\n\r\n  Seventeen county asylums, or asylums brought within the\r\n    scope of 9 Geo. IV. (1828), (twelve county asylums, five\r\n    county and subscription asylums).\r\n\r\n  Eleven of mixed character (mostly by subscription and partly\r\n    by income from charitable foundations).\r\n\r\n  Two military and naval hospitals.\r\n\r\n  Visited twice\r\n    a year.\r\n\r\n  Ninety-nine houses licensed by justices in session (fifty-nine\r\n    receiving only private patients, forty private and pauper).\r\n\r\n  Visited four\r\n  times a year.\r\n\r\n  In metropolitan district:\r\n  Thirty-seven houses licensed by Metropolitan Commissioners\r\n    (thirty-three for private patients only; four for private\r\n    and pauper).\r\n\r\n  Total public and private asylums, January 1, 1844, 166.\r\n\r\nThe result of these investigations was, Lord Ashley observed, the Report\r\npresented to the House last session, when he moved for an Address to the\r\nQueen, but withdrew it upon the Government promising to bring in a Bill.\r\nUltimately, however, the Government had requested him to undertake it.\r\n\r\nThe two Bills, having passed the Houses of Parliament, received the\r\nRoyal assent on the 4th and 8th of August, 1845.[171] They have been\r\nwell called the Magna Charta of the liberties of the insane.\r\n\r\nAfter these Acts had been in operation for eight years, it was found\r\nthat various amendments were needed, and in February, 1853, Lord St.\r\nLeonards introduced, along with another Bill lessening the expense\r\narising out of lunacy inquisitions, one consolidating the laws\r\nrespecting asylums, and one amending Lord Shaftesbury's Act (c. 100).\r\nThey constitute the 16 and 17 Vict., c. 96 and c. 97.\r\n\r\nThe former, entitled \"An Act to amend an Act passed in the ninth year\r\nof Her Majesty 'for the Regulation of the Care and Treatment of\r\nLunatics,'\" has reference mainly to private asylums and hospitals. The\r\nsame order and certificates which were required for admission into an\r\nasylum were now necessary for single patients. It was enacted that\r\nmedical men should specify the facts upon which their opinion of a\r\npatient's insanity was based, distinguishing those observed by\r\nthemselves from those communicated by others. Bethlem Hospital was by\r\nthe thirty-fifth section of this Act made subject to the provisions of\r\nthe Lunacy Acts.\r\n\r\nThe latter statute, entitled \"An Act to Consolidate and Amend the Laws\r\nfor the Provision and Regulation of Lunatic Asylums for Counties and\r\nBoroughs, and for the Maintenance and Care of Pauper Lunatics in England\r\nand Wales,\" repealed the 8 and 9 Vict., c. 126; 9 and 10 Vict., c. 84;\r\nand 10 and 11 Vict., c. 43. Many sections refer to the particular mode\r\nof determining the manner in which an asylum shall be provided for the\r\npaupers of a county and borough, whether for the county alone, or with\r\nsome other county or borough, or with the subscribers to any hospital,\r\nor with the visiting committee of a county asylum for the joint use of\r\nan existing asylum. The parish medical officer was directed to visit all\r\nthe paupers in it _every quarter_, whether in the workhouse or not, and\r\nreport to the guardians or overseer those who, in his judgment, might be\r\nproperly confined in an asylum. Thus the tendency of the Act was, in\r\nthis and other ways, calculated to add to the numbers under care, and,\r\ntherefore, to make the apparent increase of insanity greater. Three\r\nclasses of lunatics were contemplated by this Act, viz. pauper lunatics;\r\nwandering lunatics, whether paupers or not; lunatics not paupers and not\r\nwandering, who are cruelly treated or neglected. The Commissioners might\r\norder the removal of a lunatic from an asylum, unless the medical\r\nofficer certified such patient to be dangerous; and the latter might be\r\noverruled by the consent of two visiting justices to his discharge. A\r\nlarge number of the sections of this Act provide in detail for the\r\nsettlement, etc., of pauper lunatics. Penalties were enacted in the\r\nevent of any superintendent or other officer of an asylum ill-treating\r\nor neglecting a patient.[172]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of those waves of suspicion and excitement which occasionally pass\r\nover the public mind in regard to the custody of the insane, occurred in\r\n1858. Sensational articles appeared in the papers, and novels were\r\nwritten to hold up those connected with the care and treatment of the\r\ninsane to public obloquy. The author himself did not escape\r\nanimadversion, and was represented in a newspaper as a brutal mad-doctor\r\nusing a whip upon an unfortunate patient \"in an institution of which\r\nbetter things might have been expected.\" That the charge was the\r\noffspring of a bewildered editor, who confused person and place in an\r\nincredible manner, and was obliged to acknowledge that he had been the\r\nvictim of his own imagination, only shows how the paroxysms of sudden\r\npassion and indignation to which John Bull is liable, may lead to the\r\nmost ridiculous mistakes. However, there must be some fire where there\r\nis smoke, and one or two unfortunate events gave colour to the\r\nassertion, persistently made, that asylums were the abodes of injustice\r\nand cruelty. A Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed in\r\nFebruary, 1859, to inquire into the operation of the Acts of Parliament\r\nand Regulations for the Care and Treatment of Lunatics and their\r\nProperty, including Sir George Grey, Mr. Walpole, Mr. Whitbread, Mr.\r\nDrummond, Mr. Kekewich, and others; and evidence was given by the Earl\r\nof Shaftesbury, Mr. Barlow, Mr. Gaskell, Dr. Southey, Dr. Conolly, Dr.\r\nHood, Dr. Bright, Dr. Bucknill, Mr. Lutwidge, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Committee commence their Report with presenting the following\r\ncomparison of the number of lunatics in 1844, 1858, and 1859:--\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------+--------+--------+-------\r\n            Location.                      |  1844. |  1858. |  1859.\r\n  -----------------------------------------+--------+--------+-------\r\n  Private patients in asylums, hospitals,  |        |        |\r\n    and licensed houses                    |  3,790 |  4,612 |  4,762\r\n                                           |        |        |\r\n  Pauper lunatics and idiots in asylums,   |        |        |\r\n    hospitals, and licensed houses         |  7,482 | 17,572 | 18,022\r\n                                           |        |        |\r\n  Pauper lunatics and idiots in workhouses |        |        |\r\n    (655) and with friends, etc.           |  9,339 | 13,163 | 13,208\r\n                                           +--------+--------+--------\r\n                                           | 20,611 | 35,347 | 35,992\r\n  -----------------------------------------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nthe last figure showing an increase of 15,000 over the number in 1844,\r\nand being one in six hundred in the population. The Committee point out\r\nthat from 1808 to 1845 the justices had the power to provide, in every\r\ncounty, proper houses for pauper lunatics, but were not obliged to do\r\nso. There were in 1859 forty county asylums. Of seventy-one boroughs\r\nbound to provide asylums, about forty had done so.\r\n\r\nAs to public asylums, the evidence brought forward convinced the\r\nCommittee that little alteration was required in the law, they being\r\n\"well looked after and carefully attended to.\" It was suggested that\r\nthey might be in some instances too large, and the staff of attendants\r\ntoo small and not sufficiently paid. Also that it might be desirable to\r\nerect, in connection with them, detached buildings of a simple and\r\ninexpensive character for the reception of imbecile and chronic\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nIt was considered that the chief evil for which a remedy was required\r\nlay in the detention of a large number of pauper lunatics in workhouses,\r\namounting to 68,000 January 1st, 1857, and 7632 on January 1st, 1859.\r\n\"It cannot be denied that, with regard to those who are really lunatics,\r\nthere is a great absence of proper supervision, attendance, and medical\r\ntreatment. In some workhouses there are not even separate wards;\r\nmechanical restraint is frequently applied, because the imperfect state\r\nof the accommodation will not admit of a better mode of treatment; in\r\nmany cases, the medical officers of a union cannot have the special\r\nknowledge requisite for the management of the insane; and it may\r\ngenerally be concluded that the special appliances of a union workhouse\r\nare not by any means equivalent, as to this class of inmates, to those\r\nof a lunatic asylum.\" The Committee did not recommend the removal of\r\nall cases, but that no person should be detained in a workhouse\r\nrespecting whose sanity a doubt existed, without a medical certificate,\r\nrenewable quarterly; that there should be distinct wards for such\r\npatients, with distinct attendance; that the guardians should visit such\r\npatients once a quarter, and make a special entry of their condition;\r\nthat the Commissioners should visit them at least once a year; and that\r\nthe same power of removing any patient to an asylum should be given to\r\nthe Commissioners as that possessed by the justices.\r\n\r\nLord Shaftesbury on this occasion recommended that magistrates should be\r\nempowered to provide asylums by money raised on the security of the\r\nrates, for all the non-pauper classes. \"When I look into the whole\r\nmatter,\" he said, \"I see that the principle of profit vitiates the whole\r\nthing; it is at the bottom of all these movements that we are obliged to\r\ncounteract by complicated legislation, and if we could but remove that\r\nprinciple of making a profit, we should confer an inestimable blessing\r\nupon the middle classes, getting rid of half the legislation, and\r\nsecuring an admirable, sound, and efficient system of treatment of\r\nlunacy.\" The Committee, however, while encouraging such asylums founded\r\non private contributions, could not recommend that a burden should be\r\nimposed on the ratepayers, or that their establishment should be\r\ncompulsory.\r\n\r\nThe Committee suggested as safeguards against the improper detention of\r\nlunatics in private asylums (after dismissing the proposal to require\r\nthe sanction of a magistrate) various important precautions.\r\n\r\n1. Worthy of consideration whether the certificate should be verified\r\nbefore a magistrate, so as to enable him to determine whether the Act\r\nhas been complied with. 2. The certificate authorizing detention to be\r\nlimited to three months. 3. The order to state the time when the patient\r\nwas last seen, and not to be effective unless the applicant had seen the\r\npatient within three months. 4. Copy of order and certificate to be sent\r\nto the Commissioners within twenty-four hours, instead of within seven\r\ndays. 5. The patient to be visited as soon as possible by the\r\nCommissioners or by some person acting directly under their authority.\r\n6. The person who signs the order for admission to a private asylum to\r\nvisit the patient at least every six months--a clause in Mr. Gordon's\r\nAct, but omitted in that of 1845. 7. Patients to have a _prima facie_\r\nright to receive visits from and correspond with friends. 8. To make it\r\npenal for any medical man to receive a patient in a single house without\r\napprising the Commissioners of it.\r\n\r\nOther suggestions of the Committee had reference to Chancery lunatics,\r\ncriminal lunatics, and the composition and powers of the Lunacy Board.\r\n\r\nWhen this Committee met, the Acts in force were essentially similar to\r\nwhat they now are (the only important subsequent statute being that of\r\n1862), viz. for _public asylums_, the 16 and 17 Vict., c. 97, and 18 and\r\n19 Vict., 105, and for _private asylums_, 8 and 9 Vict., c. 100, 16 and\r\n17 Vict., c. 96, and 18 and 19 Vict., c. 105. According to these Acts,\r\nthe great principle which governs asylums where private patients are\r\nkept may be said to be that no person can receive into his house more\r\nthan one patient, if he derives any profit therefrom, unless he has a\r\nlicence granted to him for that purpose, and submits to the regulations\r\nwhich that licence implies.\r\n\r\nLegislation followed in 1862, in the statute 25 and 26 Vict., c. 111,\r\nentitled \"An Act to amend the Law relating to Lunatics.\"[173]\r\n\r\nIt made pauper lunatics chargeable upon the common fund of the union,\r\ninstead of the particular parish. In addition to many matters of detail\r\nin reference to the establishment of asylums, and an important section\r\nin regard to the use of workhouses for chronic lunatics, additional\r\nsafeguards were given to prevent the improper admission of patients into\r\ninstitutions for the insane, much care being shown in reference to the\r\nabuse of private asylums. Persons signing orders for admission must have\r\nseen the patient within one month. Certain persons were prohibited from\r\nsigning any certificate or order for the reception of any private\r\npatient into a licensed or other house, viz. those receiving a\r\npercentage on, or otherwise interested in, the payments to be made by\r\nany patient received into such houses; as well as any medical attendant\r\nas defined by the Lunacy Act of 1845. If defective medical certificates\r\nwere not amended within fourteen days, the Commissioners were empowered\r\nto order the patient's discharge. On admission of patient, the\r\ndocuments, with the exception of the \"statement,\" were to be\r\ntransmitted to the Lunacy Board within one clear day, instead of after\r\ntwo and before the expiration of seven, as formerly. Increased\r\nvisitation of asylums by Commissioners was provided, one of whom might\r\nvisit any asylum, hospital, or jail, in addition to the visits required\r\nby two of them. Regulations were made in regard to patients being absent\r\non trial, the transmission of their letters, and the further protection\r\nof single patients. These and some other sections were the outcome of\r\nthe suggestions of 1859-60.[174]\r\n\r\nIn 1874 a Poor Law Act granted four shillings per head out of the\r\nConsolidated Fund to paupers in asylums, to the effects of which we\r\nshall have to refer in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary now to chronicle the appointment of the Select Committee\r\nof 1877, known as Mr. Dillwyn's Committee, the result, to a large\r\nextent, of a feeling of uneasiness in the public mind, or rather, a\r\nportion of it, relative to the too easy admission of patients into\r\nasylums, and their too difficult exit, when once there. The grossest\r\ncharges were made against the proprietors of licensed asylums, and the\r\nCommissioners themselves were charged with culpable laxity. As might be\r\nexpected, some changes in the law were suggested likely to prove\r\nbeneficial, and the Report of the Committee contained sundry\r\nrecommendations of importance. The charges, however, from which the\r\ninquiry originated, fell to the ground; and had the appointment of the\r\nCommittee had no other result, the advantage would have been great, in\r\npresenting a most gratifying contrast to the revelations which took\r\nplace fifty years before, in 1827.[175]\r\n\r\nThe conclusions at which the Committee arrived were that, \"although the\r\npresent system was not free from risks which might be lessened, though\r\nnot wholly removed, by amendments in the existing law and practice, yet,\r\nassuming that the strongest cases against the present system were\r\nbrought before them, allegations of _mala fides_ or of serious abuses\r\nwere not substantiated.... The Committee cannot avoid observing here,\r\nthat the jealousy with which the treatment of lunatics is watched at the\r\npresent day, and the comparatively trifling nature of the abuses\r\nalleged, present a remarkable contrast to the horrible cruelty with\r\nwhich asylums were too frequently conducted less than half a century\r\nago, to the apathy with which the exposure of such atrocities by\r\nsuccessive Committees of this House was received, both by Parliament and\r\nthe country, and to the difficulty with which remedial enactments were\r\ncarried through the legislature.... Nevertheless, the anomalous state of\r\nthe law, which undoubtedly permits forcible arrest and deportation by\r\nprivate individuals and the fearful consequences of fraud or error,\r\nhave induced the Committee carefully to inquire whether any additional\r\nsafeguards may be devised.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the changes proposed (most of which are of the nature of\r\nsafeguards), or in some instances hinted at rather than proposed,\r\nwere:--an emergency certificate as in Scotland, signed by one medical\r\nman, but if the patient remains in the asylum more than three days, two\r\nfresh certificates to be obtained; in addition to report now required\r\nafter the admission of the patient, a careful statement to be prepared\r\nfrom the case book and sent to the Lunacy Board at the end of the first\r\nmonth; the order on which every patient is admitted to continue in force\r\nfor not more than three years, when a special report should be sent to\r\nthe Board by the superintendent, and repeated annually; the original\r\norder to be given by a near relative as in Ireland, or some responsible\r\nperson who could be called to account; the patient being visited every\r\nsix months by the person signing the order, the \"surest mode of guarding\r\nagainst unduly prolonged detention consisting in frequent and careful\r\nvisitation of all places in which any lunatic is confined, with full\r\npower placed in the hands of the Commissioners to order his discharge,\r\nand in the more general adoption of the system of probationary release.\"\r\nReports to be sent to the Commissioners of patients kept under restraint\r\nin private families or religious houses in the British Isles, not for\r\nprofit, provided that the reports are confidential, and the patients\r\nconfirmed lunatics, and not merely suffering under temporary\r\nderangement. On showing good cause for such a course, any person, as in\r\nScotland, with the sanction of the Commissioners, to send two medical\r\nmen to test the condition of any patient under control. Personal\r\nexamination of patients, such as that made by the Chancery Visitors, to\r\nbe extended to them irrespective of the possession of property. \"Either\r\nthe Chancery lunatics, who number less than a thousand, have too much\r\ncure bestowed upon them, or the others, who exceed sixty-five thousand,\r\nhave far too little.... It seems physically impossible that, with the\r\npresent strength of the Lunacy Commissioners, minute supervision of\r\nthose who require it can be efficiently exercised.\" Amalgamation of the\r\ntwo departments might obviate waste of power in visiting, stricter\r\nsupervision being also exercised over single patients, who are only\r\nvisited once a year, there being nothing in the Acts to necessitate even\r\nthis visitation. Transference of administration of property of persons\r\nunable to manage it, without deprivation of liberty, suggested.\r\nParticular workhouses to be devoted to harmless lunatics, who now crowd\r\nthe asylums, by a common action of the workhouse authorities within\r\ncertain areas. Voluntary boarders to be allowed to go to asylums,\r\nwhether they have already been in confinement or not, notice being sent\r\nto the Lunacy Board of their admission. The existence of private asylums\r\nto be left to the spontaneous action of the public, sufficient\r\naccommodation in public asylums as in Scotland, Cornwall, and at\r\nCheadle, being encouraged and facilitated by enlargement of the powers\r\nof magistrates, and other means calculated to extend this system.\r\nGreater freedom of patients in asylums, and of their visitation by\r\nfriends, and in correspondence, are regarded as valuable securities\r\nagainst the infringement of personal liberty. Whatever changes are made,\r\na consolidation of the Lunacy Acts would be most desirable. Such were\r\nthe main proposals.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions of the Committee have not yet borne fruit, but will,\r\nno doubt, be of service in future lunacy legislation.\r\n\r\nMr. Dillwyn, in introducing his last Bill (May 25, 1881),[176] proposed\r\nthat no one should be confined as a lunatic except upon an order of the\r\njustice of the peace; that no one should be incarcerated except at the\r\ninstance of a near relative, or of some solicitor of repute. There was\r\nalso provision that due notice should be given before a justice made the\r\norder, and that the order must be authorized by two medical men, one of\r\nwhom should be the medical officer of the district. For violent lunatics\r\nhe proposed the Scotch law, which permitted an emergency certificate,\r\nenabling persons who had paroxysms of lunacy to be detained for\r\ntwenty-four hours, but not longer, except on the order of some competent\r\nauthority. In the matter of discharges, he proposed that patients should\r\nbe discharged on the order of a Judge in Chambers, a stipendiary\r\nmagistrate, or a County Court judge, who should order two medical men to\r\nvisit the lunatic, and report on the case; and such judge, after\r\ncommunicating with the Lunacy Commissioners, might order the lunatic to\r\nbe liberated within ten days. As to private asylums, Mr. Dillwyn knew\r\nthat the proposals he made bearing upon them would be met by the\r\nargument of vested interests on the part of the proprietors, but he did\r\nnot think such interests ought to be exceptionally respected. He did not\r\nwish to introduce compulsion, but proposed that justices should be\r\nenabled to raise money by way of terminable annuities for the reception\r\nin public asylums of those who could pay. Mr. Dillwyn on this occasion\r\nwas in a generous mood, for he observed that \"he had nothing to say\r\nagainst private asylums, which, on the whole, were very well conducted.\"\r\nWhat he objected to was the interest which the proprietors had in\r\nkeeping their patients as long as possible. Mr. Dillwyn objected to the\r\npresent system of inspection, and made certain proposals with a view to\r\nincrease its efficiency--including a paid chairman of the Lunacy Board.\r\nMr. Dillwyn's Bill never reached the stage of the third reading, nor was\r\nit discussed in committee; and the Government, which expressed a hope\r\nthat they might be able to take the matter in hand, has not yet found\r\ntime to bring in a Bill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the foregoing sketch that the example of a better\r\nsystem of treatment slowly but surely exercised a beneficial effect,\r\ncombined as it was by the exposure of the neglect and cruelty which for\r\nthe most part marked the treatment in asylums, workhouses, and also the\r\nhome care of the insane; that the demand for legislative inquiry and\r\ninterference followed; and that the system of inspection has, step by\r\nstep, been rendered stricter and more effective. First there was\r\nintroduced the visitation by the College of Physicians, through five of\r\nits Fellows--a miserable failure. Then there was, in 1828, the\r\nappointment of Metropolitan Commissioners, whose authority was in 1842\r\nextended to the whole of England and Wales; and, last of all, was the\r\nestablishment of the Board of Lunacy Commissioners on the basis upon\r\nwhich it is now constituted. So woefully slow, if eventually successful,\r\nis the march of events in the progress of reform.\r\n\r\nThere have been several members of the legislature who have honourably\r\ndistinguished themselves by advocating in Parliament the claims of a\r\nclass whose unhappy characteristic it is that they are unable to\r\nadvocate their own cause, among whom may be mentioned Mr. T. Townshend,\r\nMr. Wynn, Mr. Rose, Mr. Gordon, Lord Somerset; but to no single\r\nlegislator is so great a debt of gratitude due as to Lord Shaftesbury,\r\nwhose untiring efforts, and conciliatory yet firm bearing, in bringing\r\nforward his measures for the relief of the insane, combined with a\r\nthorough mastery of the question and an intimate acquaintance with the\r\ncondition of houses for their care and treatment, have effected the\r\ngreatest good, and served to carry into extensive operation, principles\r\nalready enunciated, it is true, and even partially practised, but\r\nrequiring the strong arm of the law to enforce their recognition\r\nthroughout the Kingdom. The extent of obligation the insane and their\r\nfriends owe to Lord Shaftesbury, who for more than fifty years has\r\ndevoted himself to their interest, can only be fully estimated by those\r\nwho have carefully traced his unwearied assiduity in conducting measures\r\nthrough Parliament, providing for the erection of lunatic asylums and\r\nthe proper visitation of their inmates, and who are acquainted with the\r\nmanner in which he has filled the office of Chairman of the existing\r\nLunacy Board since it was formed. At that period Mr. Sheil could say in\r\nthe House, without fear of contradiction, that \"it may be truly stated\r\nthat the noble lord had added nobility even to the name of Ashley, and\r\nthat he had made humanity one of 'Shaftesbury's Characteristics.'\"[177]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[140] _Edinburgh Review_, vol. xxviii. p. 433.\r\n\r\n[141] The \"Private Mad-house Bill\" of 1814 was introduced, April 5th,\r\n\"to repeal and render more effectual the provisions of the Act of the\r\n14th of the King.\" Mr. Rose said there were actually cases in which it\r\nwas found that the medical certificate was signed by the keeper of the\r\nhouse. His Bill provided for the periodical visitation of private\r\nmad-houses by magistrates. The Bill passed the Commons July 11, 1814.\r\nIts author stated that it had been introduced the year before and amply\r\nconsidered by a Committee of the House, who were unanimous for its\r\nadoption, but I find no reference whatever in Hansard in 1813 to any\r\nBill or Committee (see Hansard, vol. xxvii.).\r\n\r\n[142] The chief members of the Committee were Lord R.

In the Minutes of the Committee of 1816, it\r\nis stated that in the same asylum the inmates were subjected to brutal\r\ncruelties from the attendants; that they suffered very much from cold,\r\nand were infested with vermin (p. 2, _et seq._).\r\n\r\nIt may be added, as showing the slowness of reform, that even when, in\r\n1828, two medical superintendents were appointed at Bethnal Green, no\r\nless than seventy, out of four hundred patients, were in irons; there\r\nwas no bath, no book or newspaper, and little or no employment.\r\n\r\n[148] Minutes of Evidence, Select Committee on Mad-houses, 1815, p. 43.\r\n\r\n[149] Hansard, vol. xxxi. p. 1146.\r\n\r\n[150] Hansard, vol. xxxiv.\r\n\r\n[151] Mr. Rose had recently died (1818).

It is, no doubt, true that\r\nrestraint begins the moment a patient enters an asylum, under whatever\r\nname it may be disguised, but by this term is technically meant the\r\nnon-use of mechanical restraint of the limbs by the strait waistcoat,\r\nleg-locks, etc. If, as indeed it may be granted, it had its real origin\r\nin the humane system of treatment introduced into England long\r\npreviously, it was in the first instance at Lincoln, and subsequently at\r\nHanwell, adopted as a universal method, and as a rule having almost the\r\nsanctity of a vow.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows, in the clearest manner, by what gradual steps\r\nthe experiment was tried and carried on at the former asylum. Dr.\r\nCharlesworth was the visiting physician and Mr. R. Gardiner Hill the\r\nhouse surgeon.\r\n\r\n  ------+--------+-------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n   Year.| Total  |   Total     | Total number  | Total number of\r\n        | number |   number    | of instances  |   hours under\r\n        | in the | restrained. | of restraint. |   restraint.\r\n        | house. |             |               |\r\n  ------+--------+-------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n   1829 |   72   |     39      |     1727      |    20,424\r\n   1830 |   92   |     54      |     2364      |    27,113-3/4\r\n   1831 |   70   |     40      |     1004      |    10,830\r\n   1832 |   81   |     55      |     1401      |    15,671-1/2\r\n   1833 |   87   |     44      |     1109      |    12,003-1/2\r\n   1834 |  109   |     45      |      647      |     6,597\r\n   1835 |  108   |     28      |      323      |     2,874\r\n   1836 |  115   |     12      |       39      |       334\r\n   1837 |  130   |      2      |        3      |        28\r\n  ------+--------+-------------+---------------+-----------------\r\n\r\nHere we observe that in 1829 more than half the number of the inmates\r\nwere subjected to mechanical restraint, while in 1836, out of 115\r\npatients, only twelve were so confined, and in 1837 there were only two\r\nout of 130.[178] The total disuse of mechanical restraints followed.\r\nThey were, however, resorted to on one or two occasions subsequently.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the foregoing, it must be mentioned that the entries\r\nof the visitors and the reports of the physicians alike agree in\r\ndescribing the condition of the patients as much improved, the quiet of\r\nthe house increased, and the number of accidents and suicides as\r\nmaterially reduced in number.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the mitigation of restraint, as evidenced by these\r\nminutes (which commence with 1819), \"was ever the principle,\" to use Mr.\r\nHill's own words, \"pressed upon the attention of the Boards of the\r\nLincoln Asylum by its able and humane physician, Dr. Charlesworth, at\r\nwhose suggestion many of the more cruel instruments of restraint were\r\nlong since destroyed, very many valuable improvements and facilities\r\ngradually adopted, and machinery set in motion which has led to the\r\nunhoped-for result of actual abolition, under a firm determination to\r\nwork out the system to its utmost applicable limits.\" Mr. Hill became\r\nhouse surgeon in 1835; and it will be seen, by the table already given,\r\nthat the amount of restraint (which, in consequence of Dr.\r\nCharlesworth's exertions, had already remarkably decreased) became less\r\nand less under the united efforts of these gentlemen, until the close of\r\nthe year 1837, when restraint was entirely abolished; and while, on the\r\none hand, as Mr. Hill frankly acknowledges, \"to his [Dr. Charlesworth's]\r\nsteady support, under many difficulties, I owe chiefly the success which\r\nhas attended my plans and labours,\" while Dr. Charlesworth's great\r\nmerit, both before and after Mr. Hill's appointment, must never be\r\noverlooked, it is due to the latter gentleman to admit that he was the\r\nfirst _to assert the principle_ of the entire abolition of mechanical\r\nrestraint, as is stated in the \"Fourteenth Annual Report of the Lincoln\r\nAsylum,\" which report is signed by Dr. Charlesworth himself.\r\n\r\nFor a time there were, certainly, some drawbacks to the success of the\r\nLincoln experiment, from the serious physical effects (such as broken\r\nribs, etc.), which occasionally resulted from the struggles between\r\nattendants and patients; and it is probable that, had not the experiment\r\nbeen carried out on a much larger scale at Hanwell by Dr. Conolly, with\r\nfar greater success, a reaction would have ensued, of infinite injury\r\nto the cause of the insane.\r\n\r\nDr. Conolly went to Hanwell in 1839; and in the first of an admirable\r\nseries of reports written by him, we read, \"The article of treatment in\r\nwhich the resident physician has thought it expedient to depart the most\r\nwidely from the previous practice of the asylum, has been that which\r\nrelates to the personal coercion, or forcible restraint, of the\r\nrefractory patients.... By a list of restraints appended to this report,\r\nit will be seen that the daily number in restraint was in July so\r\nreduced, that there were sometimes only four, and never more than\r\nfourteen, at one time [out of eight hundred]; but, since the middle of\r\nAugust, there has not been one patient in restraint on the female side\r\nof the house; and since September 21st, not one on either side.... For\r\npatients who take off or destroy their clothes, strong dresses are\r\nprovided, secured round the waist by a leathern belt, fastened by a\r\nsmall lock.... No form of waistcoat, no hand-straps, no leg-locks, nor\r\nany contrivance confining the trunk or limbs or any of the muscles, is\r\nnow in use. The coercion-chairs (forty in number) have been altogether\r\nremoved from the walls.... Several patients formerly consigned to them,\r\nsilent and stupid, and sinking into fatuity, may now be seen cheerfully\r\nmoving about the walls or airing-courts; and there can be no question\r\nthat they have been happily set free from a thraldom, of which one\r\nconstant and lamentable consequence was the acquisition of uncleanly\r\nhabits.\"\r\n\r\nIn a later report (October, 1844) Dr. Conolly observes, \"After five\r\nyears' experience, I have no hesitation in recording my opinion that,\r\nwith a well-constituted governing body, animated by philanthropy,\r\ndirected by intelligence, and acting by means of proper officers\r\n(entrusted with a due degree of authority over attendants properly\r\nselected, and capable of exercising an efficient superintendence over\r\nthe patients), there is no asylum in the world in which all mechanical\r\nrestraints may not be abolished, not only with perfect safety, but with\r\nincalculable advantage.\"\r\n\r\nFour years ago when I visited the Lancaster Asylum, I was shown a room\r\ncontaining the dire instruments of coercion formerly in use, and a most\r\ninstructive exhibition it was. At my request the superintendent, Dr.\r\nCassidy, has kindly provided me with the following list of these\r\narticles: 1 cap with straps; 4 stocks to prevent biting; 2 muzzles\r\n(leather) to cover face and fasten at the back of the head; 10 leather\r\ngloves, of various forms, perforated with holes, and cuffs of leather or\r\niron; 14 double ditto, with irons for wrists; 1 kicking shoe; 11 leather\r\nmuffs with straps; 4 stout arm leathers (long sleeves with closed ends)\r\nwith cross-belt and chains; 8 heavy body straps, with shoulder-pieces,\r\nwaist-belts, cross-belts, and pairs of handcuffs attached by short\r\nchains; 5 ditto of somewhat different make; 30 ditto, but with leather\r\ncuffs; 2 waist straps with leather cuffs attached; 9 pairs of leather\r\ncuffs padded; 11 pairs of leg-locks; a quantity of foot and hand cuffs\r\n(iron), with chains and catches to fasten to a staple in the wall or\r\nbedstead; 21-1/2 pairs of padded leather handcuffs; a larger quantity\r\nof handcuffs, single and double, of iron; 22 sets of strong body\r\nfastenings, very heavy chains covered with leather and iron handcuffs; a\r\nlarge quantity of broad leather straps; a bag of padlocks; keys for\r\nhandcuffs, etc.\r\n\r\nTruly the iron must have entered into the soul of many a poor lunatic in\r\nthose days. Mr. Gaskell began at once to remove handcuffs, etc., on his\r\nappointment as superintendent, February, 1840. The disuse of restraint\r\nis chronicled in the annual report, dated June, 1841. He resigned,\r\nJanuary 16, 1849, to become a Commissioner in Lunacy.\r\n\r\nThe Metropolitan Commissioners in Lunacy, as we have seen in the\r\nprevious chapter, issued a Report which forms an epoch in the history of\r\nthe care and provision for the insane in England and Wales. It should be\r\nstated that, previous to the date of its preparation in 1844, the\r\nfollowing asylums had been erected under the Acts 48 Geo. III., c. 96,\r\nand 9 Geo. IV., c. 40.\r\n\r\n  ------------------+--------------------------+-----------------\r\n        County.     |        Town.             | Date of opening.\r\n  ------------------+--------------------------+-----------------\r\n  Beds              | Bedford                  |    1812\r\n  Chester           | Chester                  |    1829\r\n  Cornwall          | Bodmin                   |    1820\r\n  Dorset            | Forston, near Dorchester |    1832\r\n  Gloucester        | Gloucester               |    1823\r\n  Kent              | Barming Heath, Maidstone |    1833\r\n  Lancaster         | Lancaster Moor           |    1816\r\n  Leicester         | Leicester                |    1837\r\n  Middlesex         | Hanwell                  |    1831\r\n  Norfolk           | Thorpe, near Norwich     |    1814\r\n  Nottingham        | Nottingham               |    1812\r\n  Stafford          | Stafford                 |    1818\r\n  Suffolk           | Melton, near Woodbridge  |    1829\r\n  Surrey            | Springfield, Wandsworth  |    1841\r\n  York, West Riding | Wakefield                |    1818\r\n  ------------------+--------------------------+------------------\r\n\r\nThere were two asylums in operation at this date, which were declared\r\nby local Acts county asylums, subject to the provisions of 9 Geo.

there were thirty-three metropolitan licensed houses\r\nreceiving private patients only, and four which received paupers also.\r\n\r\nThe dates of opening of these thirty-three private asylums, so far as\r\nknown, were: three in the last century, to wit, in 1744, 1758, and 1759;\r\none in each of the following years, 1802, 1811, 1814, 1816, 1823, 1825,\r\n1826, 1829, 1832, 1833, 1834, 1836, 1837, 1840, 1842, and 1843; and two\r\nin 1830, 1831, 1838, and 1839.\r\n\r\nPassing from London to the provinces, we find fifty-five provincial\r\nlicensed houses receiving private patients only, and forty-four\r\nreceiving paupers, of which one was in Wales (Briton Ferry, near\r\nSwansea). The known dates of opening were: in 1718, Fonthill-Gifford in\r\nWilts; in 1744, Lea Pale House, Stoke, near Guildford; in 1766, Belle\r\nGrove House, Newcastle-on-Tyne; in 1791, Droitwitch; and in 1792,\r\nTicehurst, Sussex; one in each of the following years, 1800, 1802, 1803,\r\n1806, 1808, 1812, 1814, 1816, 1818, 1821, 1824, and 1829; two in each of\r\nthe years 1820, 1822, 1826, 1828, 1832, 1834, 1836, 1837, 1838, and\r\n1842; three in each of the years 1825, 1831, 1839, and 1843; four in\r\n1833; five in 1830, 1835, and 1840; and, finally, six in 1841. One of\r\nthe asylums opened in 1843 was that in Wales, containing only three\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nOf some asylums found by the Commissioners to be in a very disgraceful\r\nstate, one is described as \"deficient in every comfort and almost every\r\nconvenience. The refractory patients were confined in strong chairs,\r\ntheir arms being also fastened to the chair. One of these--a woman--was\r\nentirely naked on both the days the Commissioners visited the asylum,\r\nand without doubt during the night. The stench was so offensive that it\r\nwas almost impossible to remain there.\" In another, \"in the small\r\ncheerless day-room of the males, with only one (unglazed) window, five\r\nmen were restrained by leg-locks, called hobbles, and two were wearing,\r\nin addition, iron handcuffs and fetters from the wrist to the ankle;\r\nthey were all tranquil. Chains were fastened to the floors in many\r\nplaces, and to many of the bedsteads.\" The Commissioners report of\r\nanother house that \"in one of the cells for the women, the dimensions of\r\nwhich were eight feet by four, and in which there was no table and only\r\ntwo wooden seats, we found three females confined. There was no glazing\r\nto the window.... The two dark cells, which joined the cell used for a\r\nday-room, are the sleeping-places for these three unfortunate beings.\r\nTwo of them sleep in two cribs in one cell.... There is no window and no\r\nplace for light or air, except a grate over the doors.\" The condition of\r\nthe floor and straw, on which the patients lay, it is unnecessary to\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\nWe should not be doing justice to the history of non-restraint if we did\r\nnot state in full what the Commissioners found at this period to be the\r\nopinion of the superintendents of the asylums in England.\r\n\r\n\"During our visits,\" they say, \"to the different asylums, we have\r\nendeavoured to ascertain the opinions of their medical superintendents\r\nin reference to the subject of restraint, and we will now state, in\r\ngeneral terms, the result of our inquiries. Of the superintendents of\r\nasylums not employing mechanical restraint, those of the hospitals of\r\nLincoln, Northampton, and Haslar, and of the county asylum at Hanwell,\r\nappear to consider that it is not necessary or advisable to resort to it\r\nin any case whatever, except for surgical purposes. On the other hand,\r\nthe superintendent at Lancaster[182] hesitates in giving an opinion\r\ndecidedly in favour of the non-restraint system. He thinks that,\r\nalthough much may be done without mechanical restraint of any kind,\r\nthere are occasionally cases in which it may not only be necessary, but\r\nbeneficial. The superintendent of the Suffolk Asylum considers that in\r\ncertain cases, and more especially in a crowded and imperfectly\r\nconstructed asylum, like the one under his charge, mechanical restraint,\r\njudiciously applied, might be preferable to any other species of\r\ncoercion, as being both less irritating and more effectual. The\r\nsuperintendent of the Gloucester Asylum states that he has adopted the\r\ndisuse of mechanical restraint, upon the conviction which his experience\r\nhas given him during a trial of nearly three years. Of the\r\nsuperintendents of asylums who employ mechanical restraint, those of the\r\nRetreat at York, of the Warneford Asylum, and of the hospitals at\r\nExeter, Manchester, Liverpool, and St. Luke's, consider that, although\r\nthe cases are extremely rare in which mechanical restraint should be\r\napplied, it is, in some instances, necessary. Similar opinions are\r\nentertained by the superintendents of the county asylums of Bedford,\r\nChester, Cornwall, Dorset, Kent, Norfolk, Nottingham, Leicester,\r\nStafford, and the West Riding of York. At the Retreat at York mechanical\r\nor personal restraint has been always regarded as a 'necessary evil,'\r\nbut it has not been thought right to dispense with the use of a mild and\r\nprotecting personal restraint, believing that, independent of all\r\nconsideration for the safety of the attendants, and of the patients\r\nthemselves, it may in many cases be regarded as the least irritating,\r\nand therefore the kindest, method of control. Eight of the\r\nsuperintendents employing bodily restraint have stated their opinion to\r\nbe that it is in some cases beneficial as well as necessary, and\r\nvaluable as a precaution and a remedial agent; and three of them have\r\nstated that they consider it less irritating than holding with the\r\nhands; and one of them prefers it to seclusion.\r\n\r\n\"In all the houses receiving only private patients, restraint is\r\nconsidered to be occasionally necessary, and beneficial to the\r\npatients.... At the Cornwall Asylum, we found a man who voluntarily\r\nwrapped his arm round with bands of cloth from the fear of striking\r\nothers. He untied the cloth himself at our request. We know the case of\r\none lady, who goes home when she is convalescent, but voluntarily\r\nreturns to the asylum when she perceives that her periodical attacks of\r\ninsanity are about to return, in order that she may be placed under some\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\n\"Of the asylums entirely disusing restraint, in some of them, as we have\r\nstated, the patients have been found tranquil and comfortable, and in\r\nothers they have been unusually excited and disturbed. Without, however,\r\nattaching undue importance to the condition of the asylum at the time of\r\nour visits, or to accidents that may happen under any system of managing\r\nthe insane, it is nevertheless our duty to call your Lordship's\r\nattention to the fact that since the autumn of 1842 a patient and a\r\nsuperintendent have been killed; a matron has been so seriously injured\r\nthat her life was considered to be in imminent danger (at Dr. Philp's\r\nhouse at Kensington); another superintendent has been so bitten as to\r\ncause serious apprehensions that his arm must have been amputated; and\r\ntwo keepers have been injured so as to endanger their lives. These fatal\r\nand serious injuries and accidents have been caused by dangerous\r\npatients, and some of them in asylums where either the system of\r\nnon-coercion is voluntarily practised, or is adopted in deference to\r\npublic opinion.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief summary of the arguments of medical officers\r\nand superintendents advocating absolute non-restraint at that period:--\r\n\r\n1. That their practice is the most humane, and most beneficial to the\r\npatient; soothing instead of coercing him during irritation; and\r\nencouraging him when tranquil to exert his faculties, in order to\r\nacquire complete self-control.\r\n\r\n2. That a recovery thus obtained is likely to be more permanent than if\r\nobtained by other means; and that, in case of a tendency to relapse, the\r\npatient will, of his own accord, be more likely to endeavour to resist\r\nany return of his malady.\r\n\r\n3. That mechanical restraint has a bad moral effect; that it degrades\r\nthe patient in his own opinion; that it prevents any exertion on his\r\npart; and thus impedes his recovery.\r\n\r\n4. That experience has demonstrated the advantage of entirely abolishing\r\nrestraint, inasmuch as the condition of some asylums, where it had been\r\npreviously practised in a moderate and very restricted degree, has been\r\ngreatly improved, with respect to the tranquillity and the appearance of\r\ncheerfulness among the patients in general, after all mechanical\r\ncoercion has been discontinued.\r\n\r\n5. That mechanical restraint, if used at all, is liable to great abuse\r\nfrom keepers and nurses, who will often resort to it for the sake of\r\navoiding trouble to themselves; and who, even when well disposed towards\r\nthe patient, are not competent to judge of the extent to which it ought\r\nto be applied.\r\n\r\n6. The patient may be controlled as effectually without mechanical\r\nrestraint, as with it; and that the only requisites for enabling the\r\nsuperintendents of asylums to dispense with the use of mechanical\r\nrestraint, are a greater number of attendants, and a better system of\r\nclassification amongst the patients; and that the additional expense\r\nthereby incurred ought not to form a consideration where the comfort of\r\nthe patients is concerned.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the medical and other superintendents of lunatic\r\nasylums who adopted a system of non-restraint as a general rule, but\r\nmade exceptions in certain extreme cases, urged the following reasons\r\nfor occasionally using some slight coercion:--\r\n\r\n1. That it is necessary to possess, and to acquire as soon as possible,\r\na certain degree of authority or influence over the patient, in order to\r\nenforce obedience to such salutary regulations as may be laid down for\r\nhis benefit.\r\n\r\n2. That, although this authority or influence is obtained in a majority\r\nof cases by kindness and persuasion, there are frequent instances where\r\nthese means entirely fail. That it then becomes necessary to have\r\nrecourse to other measures, and, at all events, to show the patient\r\nthat, in default of his compliance, it is in the _power_ of the\r\nsuperintendent to employ coercion.\r\n\r\n3. That a judicious employment of authority mixed with kindness (and\r\nsometimes with indulgence) has been found to succeed better than any\r\nother method.\r\n\r\n4. That the occasional use of slight mechanical restraint has, in many\r\ninstances, been found to promote tranquillity by day and rest by night.\r\n\r\n5. That it prevents, more surely than any supervision can effect, the\r\npatient from injuring himself or the other patients.\r\n\r\n6. That, particularly in large establishments, the supervision must be\r\ntrusted mainly to the attendants, who are not always to be depended on,\r\nand whose patience, in cases of protracted violence, is frequently worn\r\nout. That in such cases mild restraint insures more completely the\r\nsafety of the attendants, and contributes much to the tranquillity and\r\ncomfort of the surrounding patients.\r\n\r\n7. That in many cases mild mechanical restraint tends less to irritate,\r\nand generally less to exhaust the patient, than the act of detaining him\r\nby manual strength, or forcing him into a place of seclusion, and\r\nleaving him at liberty to throw himself violently about for hours\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n8. That the expense of a number of attendants--not, indeed, more than\r\nsufficient to restrain a patient during a violent paroxysm, but\r\nnevertheless far beyond the ordinary exigencies of the establishment--is\r\nimpracticable in asylums where only a small number of paupers are\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n9. That the occasional use of slight coercion, particularly in\r\nprotracted cases, possesses this additional advantage: that it gives the\r\npatient the opportunity of taking exercise in the open air at times\r\nwhen, but for the use of it, he would necessarily be in a state of\r\nseclusion.\r\n\r\n10. The system of non-restraint cannot be safely carried into execution\r\nwithout considerable additional expense; a matter which will necessarily\r\nenter into the consideration of those who are desirous of forming a\r\ncorrect opinion as to the precise benefits likely to arise from the\r\nadoption or rejection of such a system.\r\n\r\n11. That the benefit to the patient himself, if indeed it exist at all,\r\nis not the only question; but that it ought to be considered, whether\r\nthe doubtful advantage to himself ought to be purchased by the danger to\r\nwhich both he and his attendants and other patients are exposed, when\r\nrestraint is altogether abolished.\r\n\r\nAnd 12thly. That, when a patient is forced into and secluded in a small\r\nroom or cell, it is essentially coercion in another form, and under\r\nanother name; and that it is attended with quite as bad a moral effect,\r\nas any that can arise from mechanical restraint.[183]\r\n\r\nPassing on to 1847, we find the Commissioners in Lunacy, having acted\r\nunder the new powers conferred upon them by the two Acts passed since\r\nthe date of the Report of 1844 (8 and 9 Vict., cc. 100 and 126), able to\r\ngive a satisfactory sketch of the progress of reform in the condition of\r\nasylums. \"In several of the county asylums and hospitals,\" they observe,\r\n\"the adoption of a more gentle mode of management was originally\r\ndesigned in the direction of these establishments, and was the result of\r\npublic opinion and of the example set by the managers of the Retreat\r\nnear York. A strong impression was made on the feelings and opinion of\r\nthe public in reference to the treatment of lunatics by the publication\r\nof Mr. Tuke's account of the Retreat at York. The able writings of Dr.\r\nConolly have of late years contributed greatly to strengthen that\r\nimpression, and to bring about a much more humane treatment of lunatics\r\nin many provincial asylums, than that which formerly prevailed.\"\r\nReferring, then, to the Report of the Metropolitan Commissioners (1844)\r\nit is observed that \"proof is afforded therein that this amendment had\r\nnot extended itself to old establishments for the insane, and that much\r\nsevere and needless restraint continued to be practised in numerous\r\nprivate, and in some public asylums. In many of the private asylums, and\r\nmore especially in those which received great numbers of pauper\r\npatients, much mechanical coercion was practised, until it came to be in\r\ngreat measure laid aside in consequence of the repeated advice and\r\ninterference of the Commissioners.... In private licensed asylums it\r\nhas been thought impracticable to avoid the occasional use of\r\nmechanical coercion without incurring the risk of serious accidents.\r\nUnder these circumstances restraint of a mild kind is still practised,\r\nbut we look forward to its abolition, except, perhaps, in some\r\nextraordinary cases, so far as pauper patients are concerned, when the\r\nprovisions of the Act for the establishment of county asylums shall have\r\nbeen carried into effect. In the best-conducted county asylums it is now\r\nseldom (and in a few establishments never) resorted to.\"[184]\r\n\r\nAt this period, the actual number of lunatics returned to the\r\nCommissioners was only 18,814, but they estimated the number under some\r\nkind of care, in England and Wales, at 26,516.

Thus the safeguards against lunatic patients being\r\nsubjected to harsh or unnecessary restraint from the cruelty, idleness,\r\nor caprice of their attendants, have been multiplied, and the chances of\r\nabuse reduced to a small amount.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of lunatics placed under mechanical restraint in licensed\r\nhouses in this year is given in the following table, it being premised\r\nthat wherever the number is not specified, \"it may be assumed either\r\nthat there was no patient then under restraint, or that the number was\r\nso small, and the restraint so trivial, as not to be deemed worthy of\r\nspecial remark.\"[185]\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n                                | Number of |           |   Under\r\n            Asylum.             | patients. |Criminals. | restraint\r\n                                |           |           | last visit.\r\n  ------------------------------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n  METROPOLITAN LICENSED HOUSES. |           |           |\r\n                                |           |           |\r\n  Bethnal Green--Red House   }  |           |           |\r\n                 White House }  |    614    |    12     |     4\r\n  Bow--Grove Hall               |    291    |    --     |     2\r\n  Brompton--Earls Court         |     32    |    --     |     1\r\n  Camberwell--Camberwell House  |    246    |     1     |     5\r\n  Clapham--Retreat              |     15    |    --     |     1\r\n  Clapton, Upper--Brook House   |     42    |    --     |     1\r\n  Fulham--Beaufort House        |      5    |    --     |     2\r\n  Hillingdon--Moorcroft House   |     50    |    --     |     1\r\n  Hoxton--Hoxton House          |    416    |    --     |     4\r\n  Kensington--Kensington House  |     44    |    --     |     2\r\n  Peckham--Peckham House        |    409    |     4     |     4\r\n  Stoke Newington--             |           |           |\r\n    Northumberland House        |     35    |    --     |     1\r\n  ------------------------------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n                                | Number of |           |   Under\r\n            Asylum.             | patients. |Criminals. | restraint\r\n                                |           |           | last visit.\r\n  ------------------------------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n  PROVINCIAL LICENSED HOUSES.   |           |           |\r\n                                |           |           |\r\n  Derby--Green Hill House       |     25    |    --     |     1\r\n  Durham--Gateshead Fell        |     92    |     8     |     1\r\n  Essex--High Beach             |     34    |    --     |     2\r\n  Gloucester--Fishponds         |     45    |    --     |     1\r\n    \"         Northwoods        |     29    |    --     |     1\r\n    \"         Fairford          |    175    |     1     |     1\r\n  Hants--Grove Place            |     78    |     1     |     1\r\n  Herefordshire--Whitchurch     |     32    |     2     |     1\r\n  Kent--West Malling Place      |     40    |    --     |     3\r\n  Lancaster--Blakely House      |     24    |    --     |     1\r\n  Northumberland--Bell Grove    |           |           |\r\n    House                       |     13    |    --     |     1\r\n  Oxford--Witney                |     11    |    --     |     2\r\n    \"     Hook-Norton           |     57    |     1     |     2\r\n  Somerset--Bailbrook House     |     92    |     3     |    10\r\n  Stafford--Oulton Retreat      |     25    |    --     |     2\r\n    \"       Sandfield           |     44    |    --     |     1\r\n  Sussex--Ringmer               |      3    |    --     |     1\r\n  Warwick--Duddeston Hall       |     87    |     3     |     6\r\n    \"      Kingstown House      |     91    |    --     |     2\r\n  Wilts--Bellevue House         |    181    |     5     |     5\r\n    \"    Fiddington House       |    193    |     3     |     3\r\n  Worcester--Droitwich          |     91    |     2     |     2\r\n  York, East Riding--Hull and   |           |           |\r\n    East Riding Refuge          |    115    |     8     |     1\r\n    \"     \"       Hessle        |     12    |    --     |     1\r\n    \"   West Riding--Castleton  |           |           |\r\n    Lodge                       |     15    |    --     |     1\r\n    \"     \"        Grove House  |     41    |    --     |     5\r\n    \"     \"        Heworth      |     29    |    --     |     1\r\n  ------------------------------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n\r\nIf for the purpose of comparison at different years we take one asylum,\r\nRingmer in Sussex, there were in November 1829, nineteen patients, of\r\nwhom five were under restraint by day, and seven by night. In 1830\r\n(February) the number of patients was twenty, and of these eleven were\r\nunder restraint by day and six by night; while in October of the same\r\nyear, out of eighteen patients, there were nine under restraint. In\r\n1831, there were twenty-two patients, ten of whom were under\r\nrestraint. Writing in 1848, the Commissioners enumerate the various\r\nchanges for the better which had then taken place, among which were--an\r\nactive medical superintendence; the abolition of excessive use of\r\nmechanical restraint, there being sometimes only one or two, and\r\noccasionally no patient whatever, under mechanical restraint; the\r\nintroduction of warm and cold baths; the cleanliness of the day-rooms\r\nand dormitories; the addition of a good library, and various amusements\r\nand means of occupation; and also an excellent dietary. Such is a sample\r\nof the happy change which was, in many instances, brought about by\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nThe following classification of asylums in 1851 will show at a glance\r\nthe progress made in providing accommodation from time to time,\r\nconsequent upon legislation:--\r\n\r\n  1. Asylums existing prior to passing of Act 8 and 9 Vict., c. 126.\r\n\r\n        Accommodation for pauper lunatics at passing of the Act   5560\r\n        Additional accommodation provided therein since the\r\n          passing of the Act                                      1753\r\n                                                                  ----\r\n                                           Total accommodation    7313\r\n\r\n  2.

However, in fifty entries made in the books of\r\nthirty-six private asylums, abuses and defects are animadverted upon in\r\nfifteen instances in regard to restraint, in twenty instances in regard\r\nto bedding and clothing, nine in regard to diet, seven in regard to\r\ncleanliness, and four in regard to management and treatment. They\r\nobserve that the number of lunatics in workhouses has diminished in a\r\nvery marked degree.\r\n\r\nIn this Report the Commissioners take the opportunity of animadverting,\r\nalso, upon the defective state of the law in regard to the property of\r\nlunatics; the good effect of the Act 8 and 9 Vict., c. 100, being\r\nlessened by this and other causes.\r\n\r\nTurning to the year 1854, nearly ten years after the Act of 1845 had\r\nbeen in fruitful operation, we find the Commissioners attaching\r\nimportance to the alterations recently made in the law of lunacy by the\r\nthree important statutes, 16 and 17 Vict., c. 70 (the \"Lunacy Regulation\r\nAct\" of 1853) which refers to Chancery lunatics; 16 and 17 Vict., c. 90\r\n(an amendment of the Act under which the Board was constituted); and 16\r\nand 17 Vict., c. 97 (the \"Lunatic Asylums Act,\" 1853).\r\n\r\nThese Acts, with 8 and 9 Vict., c. 100, and 15 and 16 Vict., c. 48, and\r\nthe Acts relative to criminal lunatics, constituted at that period the\r\ncode of law of lunacy.\r\n\r\nThe following counties still remained unprovided for:--Sussex,\r\nCumberland, Westmoreland, Northumberland, Durham, Cambridge, Cardigan,\r\nCarmarthen, Glamorgan, Pembroke.\r\n\r\nNew private asylums were no longer licensed for paupers, in consequence\r\nof the accommodation provided for them in county asylums.\r\n\r\nComplaints having been made of the treatment of patients at Hanwell, an\r\ninquiry had been instituted, which, in the opinion of the Commissioners,\r\njustified them. They appeared to have been due to the want of efficient\r\nsupervision of male patients.\r\n\r\nThis Report of the Commissioners gives a series of interesting replies\r\nto a circular letter addressed to the superintendents and medical\r\nproprietors of nearly all the asylums in England and Wales, on\r\nnon-restraint, upon which they observe, \"as the general result which may\r\nbe fairly deduced from a careful examination and review of the whole\r\nbody of information thus collected, we feel ourselves fully warranted in\r\nstating that the disuse of instrumental restraint, as unnecessary and\r\ninjurious to the patient, is practically the rule in nearly all the\r\npublic institutions in the kingdom, and generally also in the\r\nbest-conducted private asylums, even those where the restraint system,\r\nas an abstract principle admitting of no deviation or exception, has not\r\nin terms been adopted.\r\n\r\n\"For ourselves,\" they observe, \"we have long been convinced, and have\r\nsteadily acted on the conviction, that the possibility of dispensing\r\nwith mechanical coercion in the management of the insane is, in a vast\r\nmajority of cases, a mere question of expense, and that its continued,\r\nor systematic use in the asylums and licensed houses where it still\r\nprevails must in a great measure be ascribed to their want of suitable\r\nspace and accommodations, their defective structural arrangements, or\r\ntheir not possessing an adequate staff of properly qualified attendants,\r\nand frequently to all these causes combined.\r\n\r\n\"Our matured views upon the subject will be best understood by stating\r\nthe course we have followed in the discharge of our functions as\r\nvisitors. In that capacity we have made it a principle to discourage, to\r\nthe utmost, the employment of instrumental restraint in any form.\r\nWherever we have found it in use, our uniform practice has been to\r\ninquire minutely into the circumstances and reasons alleged for its\r\nnecessity, and to insist on recourse being had to those various other\r\nmeans which experience has proved in other houses to be effective\r\nsubstitutes for it....\r\n\r\n\"As respects the question of _seclusion_, its occasional use for short\r\nperiods, chiefly during paroxysms of epilepsy or violent mania, is\r\ngenerally considered beneficial. At the same time, we would observe that\r\nthe facilities which seclusion holds out to harsh or indolent attendants\r\nfor getting rid of and neglecting troublesome patients under violent\r\nattacks of mania, instead of taking pains to soothe their irritated\r\nfeelings, and work off their excitement by exercise and change of scene,\r\nrender it liable to considerable abuse; and that, as a practice, it is\r\nopen, though in a minor degree, to nearly the same objections which\r\napply to the more stringent forms of mechanical restraint. We are\r\ntherefore strongly of opinion that, when even seclusion is resorted to\r\nas a means of tranquillizing the patient, it should only be employed\r\nwith the knowledge and direct sanction of the medical officer, and even\r\nthen be of very limited duration.\r\n\r\n\"Further experience, we think, has shown that, except for the reception\r\nof epileptic patients during the continuance of their paroxysms, and in\r\na few cases where there is a determined propensity to suicide, the\r\nutility of padded rooms is not so great as was at one time supposed; and\r\nthat, for cases of ordinary maniacal excitement, seclusion in a common\r\nday-room or sleeping-room of moderate size, from which all articles that\r\nmight furnish instruments of violence or destruction have been removed,\r\nand which is capable of being readily darkened, when required, by a\r\nlocked shutter, will, in general, be found to answer every useful\r\npurpose.\"[186]\r\n\r\nAs ten years had elapsed since the first attempt of any value to present\r\nthe numbers of the insane in England (see page 211), it is of interest\r\nto compare with the table referred to, the following statement of the\r\nnumbers on the 1st of January, 1854:--\r\n\r\nGENERAL STATEMENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS ASCERTAINED TO BE\r\nINSANE IN ENGLAND AND WALES, JANUARY 1, 1854.[187]\r\n\r\n  ----------------+----------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n      Where       |    Private     |     Paupers.       |    Total.\r\n     confined.    |    patients.   |                    |\r\n                  +---+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                  |M. | F.  |Total.|  M.  |  F.  |Total.|  M.  |  F.  |Total.\r\n  ----------------+---+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n  33 county and   |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  borough asylums |147|  146|   293| 5,791| 6,878|12,669| 5,938| 7,024|12,962\r\n                  |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  2 military and  |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   naval hospitals|199|    5|   204|  --  |  --  |  --  |   199|     5|   204\r\n                  |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  2 Bethlem and   |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   St. Luke's     |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   Hospitals      |235|  239|   474|     4|     7|    11|   239|   246|   485\r\n                  |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  22 other public |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   asylums        |467|  456|   923|   102|   103|   205|   569|   559| 1,128\r\n                  |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Licensed houses:|   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   42 metropolitan|608|  598| 1,206|   418|   723| 1,141| 1,026| 1,321| 2,347\r\n   88 provincial  |795|  738| 1,533|   593|   407| 1,000| 1,388| 1,145| 2,533\r\n                  |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Workhouses and  |   |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   elsewhere      | --|  -- |  --  | 5,326| 5,327|10,653| 5,326| 5,327|10,653\r\n                +-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n         Total  |2,451|2,182| 4,633|12,234|13,445|25,679|14,685|15,627|30,312\r\n  --------------+-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\nIn their ninth Report the Commissioners speak of continued progress,\r\nand to show the beneficial effects of good and kind treatment, record\r\nthe case of a lady visited by them in a private asylum, where they found\r\nher in a room by herself, in a sadly neglected condition, and very\r\nfrequently placed under mechanical restraint. Her habits were dirty, and\r\nher opportunities of taking exercise few. In consequence of her\r\nunsatisfactory condition the Commissioners ordered her removal to\r\nanother asylum (the York Retreat), and about twelve months afterwards\r\nsaw her there, and made an entry to the effect that since her admission\r\nshe had never been in restraint or seclusion; that her destructive and\r\ndirty habits had been corrected by constant attention, exercise out of\r\ndoors, and association with other patients. The Commissioners found her\r\nquiet, orderly, clean, well-dressed, and so much improved in appearance\r\nthat they had some difficulty at first in recognizing her.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable, as a result of the attention directed to the\r\ncondition of the insane, and the greatly increased provision made for\r\nthem in consequence, that there should be an alarming apparent increase\r\nof lunacy in the kingdom. In point of fact, the number of pauper\r\nlunatics had increased sixty-four per cent. in the eight years ending\r\n1855.\r\n\r\nAt this period there were 13,579 patients in county and borough asylums,\r\n1689 in registered hospitals, 2523 in metropolitan and 2588 in\r\nprovincial licensed houses, and 114 in the Royal Naval Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe number of insane poor not in asylums was estimated at 10,500, of\r\nwhom about half were inmates of workhouses, and the remainder with\r\nrelations and strangers on an allowance from the parish.\r\n\r\nThere were various obvious explanations for the apparent increase of\r\nlunacy, viz. the greatly enlarged accommodation; the prolongation of\r\nlife in consequence of kind care; the parochial authorities being\r\nrequired to take immediate proceedings for placing violent and recent\r\ncases under treatment; medical practitioners recognizing the nature of\r\ncases of insanity better; facilities of post-office, railway, and press\r\nbringing cases to light; medical officers being required to make\r\nquarterly returns under 17 and 18 Vict., c. 97, s. 66; and the efforts\r\nof the Commissioners to impress on guardians the importance of sending\r\nrecent cases to asylums.\r\n\r\nThe increase of private patients during eight years had been at the rate\r\nof only fifteen per cent.; but the Commissioners point out that this\r\nconveys an imperfect view of the relative increase of pauper and private\r\ncases, inasmuch as a practice had sprung up by which persons who had\r\nnever been themselves in receipt of relief, and who are not infrequently\r\ntradesmen or thriving artisans, had been permitted to place lunatic\r\nrelatives in the county asylums as pauper patients, under an arrangement\r\nwith the guardians for afterwards reimbursing to the parish the whole or\r\npart of the charge for their maintenance.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, it may be said with truth that, except among what are termed\r\nthe opulent classes, any protracted attack of insanity, from the heavy\r\nexpenses which its treatment entails, and the fatal interruption which\r\nit causes to everything like active industry, seldom fails to reduce its\r\nimmediate victims, and generally also their families with them, to\r\npoverty, and ultimately to pauperism.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners add--and we draw special attention to the\r\nstatement--that \"this is the main reason why, in our pauper lunatic\r\nasylums, many inmates are to be met with who have formerly held a\r\nrespectable station in society, and who, in point of education and\r\nmanners, are greatly superior to the inmates of a workhouse.\"[188] Hence\r\nwe see how utterly fallacious is the conclusion constantly drawn from a\r\nstudy of the mere figures themselves that insanity is, to the extent\r\nindicated by them, more prevalent among the lower than the higher\r\nclasses of society.\r\n\r\nThe very great importance of obtaining good attendants for asylums\r\nbecame a prominent subject now that the number of patients under\r\ntreatment had so vastly increased, and it was clearly seen that the\r\nskill of the superintendent was of little avail unless effectually\r\ncarried out by a well-qualified staff of attendants. It was necessary\r\nthat they should be liberally remunerated, and that their position in\r\nthe house should be made comfortable. The Commissioners recommended the\r\nappointment of head attendants of a superior class, whose duties should\r\nnot be restricted to any one ward, but who should be responsible for the\r\nconduct of the other attendants. A well-educated lady had been found\r\nmost useful in asylums as a companion to female patients of the upper\r\nclasses. The Commissioners required notices to be transmitted to their\r\noffices of all dismissals for misconduct of nurses or attendants, and of\r\nthe causes thereof; these notices being regularly filed for reference,\r\nin the event of inquiries being made as to the characters of applicants\r\nfor employment.\r\n\r\nReviewing the condition of the insane generally at this time in\r\nworkhouses, the Commissioners were able to report that, upon the whole,\r\na sensible amelioration had taken place in their physical condition and\r\nin their treatment. They abstained, however, from any official sanction\r\nof the construction of lunatic wards in workhouses; for the patients\r\nwere not provided with any suitable occupation, the means for exercise\r\nwere generally wanting, and the attendants were too badly paid to allow\r\nof a reliance being placed on their services.\r\n\r\nThe large number living with strangers or relatives on parish allowance\r\nappeared to have seldom fallen within the personal observation of the\r\nCommissioners, who had chiefly to depend upon the annual returns from\r\nthe clerks of the Board of Guardians, and on the quarterly returns from\r\nthe medical officers of the various districts,[189] whose returns were\r\nso defective and irregular that no definite conclusion could be drawn\r\nfrom their contents.\r\n\r\nIn their next Report the subject of workhouses still claimed the\r\nattention of the Commissioners, and they complained that, in direct\r\ncontravention of the law, pauper patients were sent first to a\r\nworkhouse, instead of an asylum. The sixty-seventh section of the Act of\r\n1853 was disregarded altogether. Hence, if the patient was found\r\nmanageable in the workhouse, he was detained there, or, if ultimately\r\nsent to the asylum, much valuable time had been lost, and his chance of\r\ncure greatly lessened. The Commissioners found their recommendations set\r\nat defiance, for the most part, whenever the report of the medical\r\nofficer stated the patient to be \"harmless.\" It was urged that the\r\nlunatic wards in workhouses should be placed in the position of licensed\r\nhouses, and that the Commissioners and visitors should be invested with\r\nthe same power in regard to them as they possessed over these\r\nestablishments. But it became very clear that, however valuable the\r\nrecommendations of the Commissioners might, and, indeed, have ultimately\r\nproved to be, they did not possess the authority of commands. At the\r\ninfirmary asylum at Norwich unceasing suggestions for improvement were\r\nmade for _ten years_, which were, \"with very few exceptions,\r\nsystematically disregarded.\" Then, but not till then, did the\r\nCommissioners appeal to the Secretary of State, to require the\r\nauthorities of Norwich to provide for their lunatic poor, according to\r\nthe statutes 8 and 9 Vict., c. 126, passed twelve years before. The Act\r\nof 1853, having introduced some modification for boroughs of small\r\npopulations, left no further excuse for making proper provision. The\r\nCommissioners from time to time issued circulars to the various asylums,\r\nand intimated their intention to report to the Secretary of State (under\r\ns. 29 of the Act) the cases of all boroughs wherein proper provision\r\nhad not been made for their pauper lunatics. \"But even this last appeal\r\ndid not fare more successfully; and all our reiterated inquiries and\r\nremonstrances have as yet made hardly a perceptible impression upon that\r\nalmost general neglect of the law which it was hoped they might repair.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the important class of single patients, the Commissioners had\r\nnot found it practicable to visit them as they desired to do. Many,\r\nhowever, had been visited. Some were found indifferently accommodated,\r\nand otherwise in a very unsatisfactory state. The provisions of the law\r\nwere extensively evaded.[190]\r\n\r\nAs the views entertained and recommended by the Commissioners from time\r\nto time are of importance in regard to the construction of asylums, it\r\nmay be observed that in their Report of 1857 they dwell on the evils of\r\nvery large buildings, on account of the loss of individual and\r\nresponsible supervision, the loss of the patient's individuality, and\r\nthe tendency of the rate of maintenance for patients to run higher.[191]\r\nIt was also maintained that the divided responsibility consequent on\r\nsuch large institutions was injurious to management, and that the cures\r\nof patients were actually fewer. It was considered that the limits to\r\nthe size of the Hanwell Asylum were reached, and indeed exceeded, viz.\r\nfor 1020, but room for 600 patients more was required. So at Colney\r\nHatch there were 1287 patients, while 713 more demanded admission. When,\r\nin 1831, Hanwell was built for 500, it was thought sufficient to provide\r\nfor the whole of Middlesex! Two years after, however, it was full; in\r\nanother two years it was reported to contain 100 patients more than it\r\nwas built for, and after the lapse of another two years it had to be\r\nenlarged for 300 more; Colney Hatch having been constructed for 1200\r\npatients belonging to the same county, and opened in 1851; and yet,\r\nwithin a period of less than five years, it became necessary to appeal\r\nto the ratepayers for further accommodation, and the latest return\r\nshowed that, at the close of 1856, there were more than 1100 paupers\r\nbelonging to the county unprovided for in either of its asylums. \"Hardly\r\nhad they been built, when the workhouses sent into each such a large\r\nnumber of chronic cases as at once necessarily excluded the more\r\nimmediately curable, until the stage of cure was almost past; and the\r\ndoors of the establishment became virtually closed not long after they\r\nwere opened to the very inmates for whom only it was needful to have\r\nmade such costly provision.\" Hence the Commissioners urged separate and\r\ncheaper asylums for old cases; but the committees of the asylums\r\nobjected. The Secretary of State induced the two parties to meet, but,\r\nbeing unable to agree, the Commissioners reluctantly gave way.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the amount of existing accommodation for pauper lunatics in the\r\ncounties and boroughs was--for males, 7516; females, 8715; total,\r\n16,231; and the additions then being made to old asylums amounted\r\nto--for males, 1172; females, 1309; total, 2481. The numbers for whom\r\nadditional asylums were then being made were--males, 1169; females,\r\n1157; total, 2326. The sum of these totals being 21,048. There were, on\r\nthe 1st of January of this year, 17,572 pauper lunatics in asylums, of\r\nwhom as many as 2467 were still confined in private asylums. There were\r\nnow 33 county and 4 borough asylums, 15 registered hospitals, 37\r\nmetropolitan licensed houses, and 80 provincial licensed houses; also\r\nthe Royal Naval Hospital. The total number of inmates in these\r\nestablishments were (in the order enumerated) 15,163, 1751, 2623, 2647,\r\n126, making a grand total of 22,310, including 295 patients found\r\nlunatic by inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners point out that a military asylum is a desideratum,\r\nthere being no provision for soldiers, while sailors were well cared for\r\nat Haslar Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars will show at a glance the provision made at\r\nthis period for the insane in England and Wales:--\r\n\r\n1. Boroughs having asylums: Birmingham, Bristol (in St. Peter's\r\nHospital), Hull.\r\n\r\n2. Boroughs erecting or about to erect asylums: Maidstone, Bristol, City\r\nof London.\r\n\r\n3. Boroughs in union with counties: Cambridge, Colchester, Maldon,\r\nGloucester, Leicester, Grantham, Lincoln, Stamford, Hereford,\r\nNottingham, Abingdon, Oxford, Reading, Shrewsbury, Wenlock, Worcester.\r\n\r\n4. Boroughs whose pauper lunatics are sent to asylums under contract or\r\narrangements between justices, etc.: Plymouth, Chichester, Portsmouth,\r\nSouthampton, Devizes, Salisbury, Chester, Derby, Barnstaple, Bideford,\r\nDartmouth, Exeter, South Molten, Tiverton, Tewkesbury, Bridgewater,\r\nBridgnorth, Ludlow, Penzance, Poole, Winchester, Newark, Oswestry, Bath,\r\nLichfield, Scarborough.\r\n\r\n5. Boroughs which have not made any statutory provision for the care of\r\ntheir pauper lunatics: Bedford, Newbury, Buckingham, Carmarthen,\r\nAndover, Canterbury, Dover, Hythe, Rochester, Sandwich, Tenterden,\r\nKing's Lynn, Norwich, Thetford, Yarmouth, Northampton, Berwick-upon-Tweed,\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, New Radnor, Bury St. Edmunds, Ipswich, Guildford,\r\nHastings, York.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the expense of pauper lunatics in asylums was thrown upon the\r\ncommon fund of the union, instead of on the particular parish. The\r\neffect was natural. Many patients were removed from workhouses to the\r\ncounty asylums, some of whom might well have remained there. There could\r\nbe no objection to this, if the latter cost no more than the former; but\r\nseeing that where the one costs L200 per bed, the other would only cost\r\nL40, the effect is, from the point of view of the ratepayer, who usually\r\nobjects to contribute to the formation of a free library, a very serious\r\none.\r\n\r\nTwenty years after the census of the insane made in 1844, and ten after\r\nthe period to which the table given at p. 230 refers, we find the\r\nnumbers as follow[192]:--\r\n\r\nGENERAL STATEMENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS ASCERTAINED TO BE\r\nINSANE IN ENGLAND AND WALES, JANUARY 1, 1864.\r\n\r\n  ----------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n       Where      |     Private      |     Paupers.       |       Total.\r\n      confined.   |     patients.    |                    |\r\n                  +-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                  |  M. |  F. |Total.|  M.  |  F.  |Total.|   M. |  F.  |Total.\r\n  ----------------+-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n  42 county and   |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   borough asylums|  118|  113|   231| 9,690|11,630|21,320| 9,808|11,743|21,551\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  1 military and  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   naval hospital |  153|  -- |   153|   -- |  --  |  --  |   153|  --  |   153\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  2 Bethlem and   |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   St. Luke's     |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   Hospitals      |  264|  215|   479|   -- |  --  |  --  |   264|   215|   479\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  13 other public |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   asylums        |  708|  591| 1,299|   170|   178|   348|   878|   769| 1,647\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Licensed houses:|     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   37 metropolitan|  831|  649| 1,480|   253|   589|   842| 1,084| 1,238| 2,322\r\n   65 provincial  |  987|  698| 1,685|   256|   192|   448| 1,243|   890| 2,133\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Workhouses and  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   elsewhere      |  -- |  -- |   -- | 8,125| 8,126|16,251| 8,125| 8,126|16,251\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Broadmoor       |  -- |  -- |   -- |   -- |    95|    95|  --  |    95|    95\r\n                  +-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n      Total[193]  |3,061|2,226| 5,327|18,494|20,810|39,304|22,555|23,076|44,631\r\n  ----------------+-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\nWe must not pass by the year 1867 without recording that at this period\r\na statute important in its bearing on the provision made for the insane\r\npoor of London was enacted. This was the Metropolitan Poor Act, which\r\nestablished what are known as the Metropolitan District Asylums for\r\nImbeciles at Leavesden (Hertfordshire), Caterham (Surrey), Hampstead,\r\nand Clapton. Legally these institutions are classed under workhouses.\r\n\r\nMuch difference of opinion exists as to the wisdom of having separate\r\ninstitutions for the incurable. That there is great danger of\r\noverlooking the fact that some incurable patients require quite as much\r\nattention as the curable is certain; they may indeed, if neglected, be\r\nreduced to a more pitiable condition than the latter; but this does not\r\nprove that, under the present safeguards provided by the legislature,\r\nthere may not be a safe recourse to this mode of making provision for\r\nthis class of the insane. At any rate, it is of interest to know what\r\nhas been done in this direction during the last few years in England.\r\n\r\nAsylums have been erected at Leavesden, near Watford, Herts; Caterham,\r\nSurrey; and Darenth, near Dartford, Kent, there being at Darenth both\r\nidiot schools and an institution for incurables.\r\n\r\nThese are the Metropolitan District Asylums.[194]\r\n\r\nAs the primary object in adopting this kind of accommodation is economy,\r\nit is important to present a clear statement of the finances, omitting\r\nshillings and pence.\r\n\r\nTake Leavesden as the example, where the accommodation is for 2000\r\npatients (M. 900, F. 1100). The land, which was purchased in 1867 and\r\n1880, has cost L9401, the area being eighty-four acres. The laying out\r\nthe grounds, etc., cost L3000; the cost of building and drainage (up to\r\nMichaelmas, 1878) was L121,674; the engineering works, fixtures, and\r\nfittings cost L16,162; the furniture, bedding, and clothing, L16,235;\r\nthe architect's and surveyor's charges, and clerk of works, L5108;\r\nsolicitor's charges, printing, insurances, and all other charges, L1526;\r\nthe total being L173,118, or L86[195] per bed. Taking out the items of\r\nfurniture, bedding, and clothing, we have the sum of L77 per bed. How\r\nstriking the difference when compared with the expense of an ordinary\r\ncounty asylum, the reader who has examined the figures given at page 166\r\nwill readily perceive.\r\n\r\nLet us now pass on to the year 1870. We find the Commissioners able to\r\nstate, as the result of very minute and careful inspection, that the\r\nReports of their members during the previous year showed, on the whole,\r\nthat good progress continued to be made in the mode of managing \"these\r\nlarge and daily increasing institutions,\" and they add, \"although in\r\nsome instances it has been our duty to comment on shortcomings and cases\r\nof neglect, we have generally been able to bear testimony to the skill\r\nand zeal evinced by the medical superintendents in the execution of\r\ntheir very grave and difficult duties.\"[196] On the other hand, they\r\nobserve, \"We regret that we shall have to describe several acts of\r\nviolence committed by attendants in county asylums, which in three\r\ninstances were followed by fatal results, but in only one of which,\r\nalthough careful inquiries were instituted, such evidence was obtained\r\nas would justify criminal proceedings.\"\r\n\r\nThe Report on the Liverpool Lunatic Hospital shows how far from\r\nsatisfactory one, at least, of these institutions was at that time:\r\n\"With few exceptions, the personal condition of the patients was found\r\nto be very indifferent, and indeed the reason alleged why the females in\r\nthe lower wards were never on any occasion taken beyond the\r\nairing-court, was that they had no clothes fit to be seen in. The\r\ncorresponding class of men was stated to be taken out as little as the\r\nwomen, and both were said to be rarely visited by any friends having an\r\ninterest in them. The state of the furniture was discreditable in the\r\nextreme, and there was a general absence of tidiness throughout the\r\nhospital. The patients were, with few exceptions, quiet; not more than\r\nfour or five of the better class of either sex were reported to have the\r\nopportunity of walking or driving out.... The seclusion in the fifteen\r\nmonths which had elapsed since the previous visit applied to five males\r\non 62 occasions, and to 18 females on 132 occasions.\"[197]\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners speak of \"the invariable success attendant on such\r\nhospitals as have been built during the last few years, and specially at\r\nCheadle.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to licensed houses within their jurisdiction, they were\r\nreported to be \"generally, as to the condition and management of such\r\nhouses, of a very satisfactory character;\" while of the provincial\r\nhouses they say, \"The Reports, for the most part, have not been\r\nunfavourable as to their condition and management.\"[198]\r\n\r\nIn this Report the Commissioners comment on the operation of the\r\nMetropolitan Poor Act of 1867, which threw the maintenance of lunatics\r\nin asylums upon the common poor fund of the metropolis, and they observe\r\nthat \"it has induced the boards of guardians to relieve themselves of\r\nlocal charges, and this has greatly contributed to swell the removals\r\nfrom workhouses to asylums, notwithstanding that the patients have in\r\nlarge numbers been unable to be received nearer than in the county\r\nasylums of Northumberland, Yorkshire, Staffordshire, and Somersetshire,\r\nand although the rate of maintenance has ranged from 14s. to 17s. 6d.\r\nper week.\"\r\n\r\nAs the cost of lunatics is so important a question, it may here be\r\nstated that the total weekly cost per head in 1870 averaged in the\r\ncounty asylums 9s. 3d., including maintenance, medicine, clothing, and\r\ncare. Under the maintenance account were comprised furniture and\r\nbedding, garden and farm, and miscellaneous expenses. The other items\r\nwere provisions, clothing, salaries and wages, fuel, light and washing,\r\nsurgery and dispensary, wine, tea. In this estimate was reckoned the\r\ndeduction for moneys received for produce sold, exclusive of those\r\nconsumed in the asylum.\r\n\r\nThe weekly cost in the following registered hospitals was as follows:--\r\n\r\n                           L    s.  d.\r\n  Coton Hill               1    7   1-1/2\r\n  Northampton              0   13   5-3/4\r\n  York Lunatic Hospital    0   18   0\r\n  York Retreat             1    1   2-3/4\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that Northampton was at this time essentially the\r\npauper asylum for the county.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the paramount importance of reliable\r\nattendants. \"Nothing is easier,\" the Commissioners observe, \"for a man\r\nin such a position, with unrestricted and uncontrolled power over the\r\nhabits and happiness of another, than to act cruelly without being\r\ncruel.\" So long ago as 1851 a check was given to the conduct of\r\nattendants by a decision of the courts in that year. An attendant had\r\nbeen convicted of manslaughter on the evidence of a patient. This was\r\nappealed against, but the conviction was sustained. Lord Campbell laid\r\nit down that the only thing needful was for the patient to understand\r\nthe nature of an oath and what he was saying. \"But although this ruling\r\nhas never since been disputed, the many subsequent attempts of the\r\nCommissioners to exact a rigid responsibility for acts of violence or\r\ncruelty in asylums have, through the indisposition of juries[199] to\r\naccept the evidence principally available for proofs in such cases, more\r\nfrequently failed than succeeded.\"[200]\r\n\r\nIn each of the three previous years, proceedings had been taken against\r\nattendants, and with very limited success. In the beginning of 1870,\r\nhowever, a prosecution instituted by the magistrates of the Lancaster\r\nAsylum against two attendants for manslaughter on the evidence of a\r\npatient succeeded, and they were sentenced to seven years' penal\r\nservitude, a result which the Commissioners regarded as the most\r\nbeneficial example within their experience. During the previous year,\r\neighty-eight male attendants had been dismissed from\r\nservice--fifty-three for drunkenness, insubordination, or neglect of\r\nduty, and thirty-five for assaults on patients; four only of these\r\nlatter having had criminal prosecutions instituted against them, and of\r\nthe former not one. Of the number dismissed, fifteen were in licensed\r\nhouses, three in public hospitals, and the remaining seventy in county\r\nasylums. During the same period thirty-four female attendants were\r\ndismissed, of whom twenty-four were employed in county asylums. Eleven\r\nhad been guilty of violence or rough usage to patients, there having\r\nbeen no prosecution in any instance. The Commissioners justly observe\r\nthat, while \"there has been no greater work of mercy and humanity than\r\nthat which rescued the lunatic patients from stripes and filth, or\r\ncontinued restraint and isolation, yet it will remain to some degree\r\nstill imperfect until he is also rescued from the possible chance of\r\nbeing subjected to the unwatched or unchecked humours and caprices of\r\nignorant, careless, or cruel attendants.\"[201]\r\n\r\nA striking instance of the respective powers of the Committees of\r\nasylums and the Commissioners in Lunacy occurs in the Report of the\r\nlatter for 1870. Death from broken ribs had taken place in a county\r\nasylum, and the Commissioners considered the cruelty of an attendant\r\nestablished. They reported inadequate supervision of the wards, as well\r\nas the attendants, in reply to which the committee of visitors asserted\r\nthat they would not enter into any discussion on a subject upon which\r\nthey considered themselves fully competent to determine how they should\r\ndischarge their own duties. The Commissioners found that they had no\r\nalternative but to leave to the refractory committee the\r\nresponsibility, which they had shown no unwillingness to assume, of the\r\nadoption or rejection of such recommendations. \"The law which has\r\nrequired us to investigate and report as to matters affecting the\r\nmanagement of county asylums, has invested us with no authority further\r\nto enforce our views.\" In the same way their authority was set at naught\r\nin an asylum where an idiot boy was found on the floor, strangled by a\r\npocket-handkerchief, effected, there was every reason to believe, by one\r\nof the patients, and the Commissioners found that the deed could not\r\nhave been perpetrated if attendants had been properly dispersed through\r\nthe wards. The union authorities failed to get satisfaction from the\r\ncommittee, and the Secretary of State was memorialized by the guardians,\r\nwho were backed up by the Commissioners, but in vain. Hence the\r\nCommissioners complained of \"the limits thus placed to all real\r\nauthority but that of the committee of visitors over establishments\r\nwhose inmates are necessarily most at the mercy of attendants, and in\r\nwhich these cases of misconduct most frequently occur.\"[202]\r\n\r\nWe have alluded to this circumstance, not to indicate that at the\r\npresent time the committees of asylums set themselves in opposition to\r\nthe recommendations of the Commissioners, but our historical sketch\r\ndemands, in justice to the latter, who are often supposed to have\r\nunlimited power, that it should be known that desirable reforms may not\r\nbe carried out in our asylums, and yet the fault may not lie at the door\r\nof the Lunacy Commissioners. And it should be stated that recently Lord\r\nShaftesbury has publicly expressed his individual opinion that it is\r\nbetter for the views and wishes of the Commissioners to appear in the\r\nform of recommendations rather than commands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree years later, the condition of county and borough asylums was, with\r\nfew exceptions, satisfactory, and declared by the Commissioners to be\r\nvery creditable to the governing bodies and superintendents.\r\nImprovements had taken place in many of these institutions, and there\r\nwas found to be a more general recognition of the humanizing and\r\nbeneficial influence of cheerful and well-furnished wards, on even the\r\nmost degraded patients. \"Those at one time considered to be fit only to\r\nbe congregated together in the most dreary rooms of the asylum, with\r\ntables and benches fastened to the floor, and with nothing to interest\r\nor amuse them, are now in many asylums placed in wards as well furnished\r\nas those occupied by the more orderly patients, with birds, aquariums,\r\nplants, and flowers in them, and pictures on the walls; communicating\r\nalso with such wards are now very generally to be found well-planted and\r\nwell-kept airing-courts. The less strict classification of the patients\r\nis also advantageously followed in many asylums, and in them what are\r\ntermed \"refractory wards\" are properly abolished. Where arrangements for\r\nthis purpose have been judiciously made and carried out with energy, the\r\nbest results have followed, in the way of an improved condition and more\r\norderly demeanour of those disposed to be turbulent, whilst the comfort\r\nof patients of a more tranquil character has not been prejudicially\r\naffected. The use of mechanical restraint in county and borough asylums,\r\nunless for surgical reasons, such as to prevent patients removing\r\ndressings or applications to wounds or injuries, or during the forcible\r\nadministration of food, is, with few exceptions, abolished. In\r\nthirty-eight of the fifty-four asylums visited during the past year,\r\nthere was no record whatever of its employment. In the cases of\r\ntwenty-two patients, distributed over ten asylums, it had been resorted\r\nto for the above-mentioned reasons, and in six asylums it had been used\r\nto counteract violent suicidal or destructive propensities; the number\r\nof patients restrained for these latter reasons (exclusive of Colney\r\nHatch and Wandsworth) having been one in the Macclesfield, nine in the\r\nGlamorgan, six in the Prestwich, and one in the Norwich Borough Asylum.\r\nIn the Wandsworth Asylum it will be seen from the Report that, during a\r\nperiod of about sixteen months, thirty-three men and twelve women were\r\nrecorded as having had their hands restrained by gloves for destructive\r\npropensities; and four males and one female had worn restraint dresses\r\nat night, two on account of their suicidal tendencies, and one for\r\nviolence. At the visit to Colney Hatch, a very dangerous male epileptic\r\nwas found restrained by wrist-straps and a belt, and from the register\r\nit appeared that he had been thus constantly restrained during the day\r\nfor a period of nine months. Ten other male patients were also recorded\r\nas having been restrained; one having had his hands fastened, and the\r\nremainder having worn gloves, altogether on two hundred and fifty-three\r\noccasions.... At the same visit nine men were found wearing special\r\nstrong canvas dresses, besides others who were clothed in an exceptional\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\nThe objections which for a long time have been felt to frequent resort\r\nto seclusion find expression in this Report. The Commissioners, without\r\nquestioning the utility of seclusion in certain cases, stated their\r\nconviction that \"in a remedial point of view its value has been much\r\nexaggerated, and that in many instances it is employed unnecessarily and\r\nto an injurious extent, and for periods which are quite unjustifiable.\"\r\nPatients regard it as a punishment; and attendants are apt to make it\r\ntake the place of constant supervision. Its frequent use indicates\r\ndefective asylum organization or management. The Report states that it\r\nis no longer employed at the Durham, Stafford, Brentwood, and Brookwood\r\nAsylums; and only rarely at the Wakefield, Oxford, Northumberland,\r\nCarmarthen, Chester, Dorset, Glamorgan, Leicester, Lincoln, and Norfolk\r\nCounty Asylums, and those for the boroughs of Ipswich and Leicester, and\r\nfor the City of London.\r\n\r\nLegislation has exercised a great and, as some think, questionable\r\ninfluence upon the relative proportion of the insane in workhouses and\r\nasylums. The feeling that originally induced the Commissioners in Lunacy\r\nto urge the transference of lunatics from workhouses to county asylums\r\nwas, no doubt, a laudable one, and in a large number of instances most\r\nadvantageous. The condition of the insane in workhouses, however,\r\nbecame vastly improved, and it was impossible to deny that for many\r\nharmless chronic cases they were, to say the least, sufficiently\r\ncomfortable in the workhouse. Then came the legislation of 1874,[203] by\r\nwhich four shillings a week were allowed for every pauper lunatic in any\r\nasylum or licensed house, being reimbursed to the unions and parishes\r\nfrom which the patient was sent. Hence the strong inducement, in some\r\ncounties at least, for it certainly does not hold good in all, to\r\ntransfer lunatics detained in workhouses to the asylums, even when no\r\noccasion whatever arises out of the mental condition of the patient to\r\njustify such transference. The Commissioners themselves have recognized\r\nthe difficulty and disadvantage of the operation of this legislation,\r\nand say in their twenty-ninth Report, 1875, that while this Act \"may be\r\nbeneficial in promoting the removal to asylums of a certain number of\r\npatients requiring such treatment, and who might possibly otherwise be\r\ndeprived of it ... it remains to be seen whether the alteration in the\r\nincidents of the maintenance charged, will not also have the effect of\r\ncausing unnecessarily the transfer to asylums of chronic cases, such as\r\nmight be properly cared for in workhouses, thus rendering necessary, on\r\nthe part of counties and boroughs, a still larger outlay than heretofore\r\nin providing additional asylum accommodation. The returns for the 1st of\r\nJanuary last tend to show that such results are not unlikely to\r\naccompany the working of this new financial arrangement.\"[204] The Irish\r\ninspectors in their report for 1875 calculate that the maximum number\r\nwho could properly be transferred from asylums to workhouses is seven or\r\neight per cent., and they make the observation, which no doubt is very\r\njust, that many patients who are quiet and demeanable under trained\r\nnurses in an asylum would become intractable elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs we have now reached another decade, it will be well to afford the\r\nreader the opportunity of comparing the population of asylums, and\r\nworkhouses, with that which we have given in 1844, 1854, and 1864.\r\n\r\nGENERAL STATEMENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PERSONS ASCERTAINED TO BE\r\nINSANE IN ENGLAND AND WALES, JANUARY 1, 1874.\r\n\r\n  ----------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n       Where      |     Private      |      Paupers.      |       Total.\r\n    confined.[205]|     patients.    |                    |\r\n                  +-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n                  | M.  | F.  |Total.|  M.  |  F.  |Total.|  M.  |  F.  |Total.\r\n  ----------------+-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n  31 county and   |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   borough asylums|  194|  221|   415|14,238|16,718|30,956|14,432|16,939|31,371\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  3 military and  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   naval          |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   hospitals, and |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   Royal India    |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   Asylum         |  342|   16|   358|  --  |  --  |  --  |   342|    16|   358\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  2 Bethlem and   |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   St. Luke's     |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   Hospitals      |  167|  268|   435|  --  |  --  |  --  |   167|   268|   435\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  13 other public |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   public asylums |1,107|  891| 1,998|   174|   165|   339| 1,281| 1,056| 2,337\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Licensed houses:|     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   39 metropolitan|1,006|  787| 1,793|   257|   614|   871| 1,263| 1,401| 2,664\r\n   67 provincial  |  772|  754| 1,526|   200|   323|   523|   972| 1,077| 2,049\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  1 Broadmoor     |  267|   64|   331|   148|    41|   189|   415|   105|   520\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Private single  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   patients       |  168|  268|   436|  --  |  --  |  --  |   168|   268|   436\r\n                  |     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Workhouses:    }|     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   Males, 6372;  }|     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   females, 8646;}|     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   total, 15,018 }|     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  Elsewhere:     }|  -- |  -- |  --  | 9,084|12,773|21,857| 9,084|12,773|21,857\r\n   Males, 2712;  }|     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   females, 4127;}|     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n   total; 6839   }|     |     |      |      |      |      |      |      |\r\n                  +-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n      Total[206]  |4,023|3,269| 7,292|24,101|30,634|54,735|28,124|33,903|62,027\r\n  ----------------+-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n\r\nReferring to the numbers of the insane in 1875, the Commissioners\r\nobserve that they have increased beyond the growth of the population.\r\nThis had been mainly among paupers, there having been 16.14 of this\r\nclass in 1849, and 23.55 in 1875, per 10,000 of the population; while of\r\nprivate patients the advance had only been from 2.53 to 3.09 during the\r\nsame period. The population increased from 1849 to 1875, 22.63 per cent.\r\nPrivate patients increased 48.39 per cent., and pauper patients 77.47\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the treatment of the insane in Wales, it may be stated that\r\nuntil the Denbigh Asylum was opened in November, 1847, there was no\r\ninstitution for the reception of lunatics, except the small asylum at\r\nHaverfordwest, and a house licensed in 1843 for private and pauper\r\npatients in Glamorganshire.[207] Most of the paupers were kept in their\r\nhomes or workhouses; others sent to asylums. Before the Act was passed\r\nmaking it compulsory on the counties to provide accommodation, several\r\nphilanthropic gentlemen, impressed with the desirability of having an\r\ninstitution for private patients in North Wales, and where all the\r\nofficers should possess a knowledge of Welsh, which language alone the\r\nvast majority of the inhabitants knew at that time, collected about\r\nL8000. By this time the Act was passed, and the subscribers made over\r\ntheir money to the counties, on condition that twenty-six separate beds\r\nshould be kept for private patients--several of themselves to be\r\nmembers of the Committee. The private apartments form part of the same\r\nbuilding, but the inmates do not associate with the paupers. The total\r\naccommodation was two hundred, and there was a great outcry at the\r\nbuilding of such a large place. About fifteen years ago, two wings were\r\nadded, each to hold one hundred beds, and last year an additional one of\r\none hundred and thirty beds.\r\n\r\nIt appears that many of the first patients received at the Denbigh\r\nAsylum had been most cruelly treated at their own home, or where placed\r\nwith strangers; some being kept tied and in seclusion for years, and\r\nshamefully neglected. The following is an extract from the first Medical\r\nReport:--\"In the case of one man, who was goaded by unkind and harsh\r\ntreatment into a state of ferocious mania (and who was brought into the\r\nasylum manacled so cruelly that he will bear the marks of the handcuffs\r\nwhile he lives), it is most gratifying to be enabled to state that he\r\ngradually became confiding and tractable, and he is now as harmless as\r\nany patient in the house. In another instance, a poor young creature,\r\nwho before her admission was tied down to her bed for months, quickly\r\ndiscovered the difference between the treatment she had previously been\r\nsubject to and the kindness and freedom she experienced at the asylum,\r\nand very soon gained confidence in those about her, and rapidly\r\nrecovered. Soon after her discharge from the asylum, she wrote to the\r\nmatron, to request to be taken back as a servant, and she is now an\r\nexcellent assistant in the wards, and a general favourite with the\r\npatients. We have the satisfaction of stating that we have never been\r\nobliged to resort to any mechanical restraint, beyond temporary\r\nseclusion in a padded room, etc.\" Complaints occur in the earlier\r\nreports of the disinclination either of friends or of the poor law\r\nauthorities to send in patients before they become unmanageable, and\r\nmany of those admitted arrived secured by handcuffs or tied down in\r\ncarts.\r\n\r\nTake another extract from the Report for 1851. \"We were requested to\r\nturn into a respectable farmhouse, and upon going upstairs we were\r\nhorrified to find the farmer's wife with her hands secured, and a large\r\ncart-rope tied round her body to keep her in bed. The room was filthy.\r\nWe found she had been in this state for nine months, and no proper\r\nremedial measures taken. Surely some protection should be thrown over\r\nsuch a sufferer!\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in the Report for 1853: \"One most atrocious case of an opposite\r\nkind of treatment has fallen within our notice during the year. It is\r\nmost deplorable to contemplate, after the repeated generous efforts made\r\nby the press, both Welsh and English, to diffuse useful knowledge upon\r\nthe subject of insanity, that in a Christian country, and in a populous\r\ndistrict, and with the knowledge of most of the neighbouring\r\ninhabitants, a fellow-creature should have been permitted to be chained\r\nby both his legs in a miserable shed for seven long years. The case is\r\nso painfully interesting, that we will add to this Report the document\r\nwhich was sent to the Lord Chancellor, who, at the instigation of the\r\nCommissioners in Lunacy, issued an order for visiting the poor sufferer.\r\nThe Commissioners, with laudable alacrity, ordered a prosecution to be\r\ninstituted, and the principal offender was tried at the Carnarvonshire\r\nassizes, convicted, and sentenced to be imprisoned.... What renders the\r\nconduct of the friends of Evan Roberts more inexcusable is the fact of\r\nhis having been perfectly sane when visited, and having remained so ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n                                     _Denbigh, June 16, 1853._\r\n\r\n    \"SIR,\r\n\r\n    \"In obedience to the order of the Lord Chancellor, etc., I\r\n    have to report that I found Evan Roberts in a small shed, six\r\n    feet wide and nine feet four inches long, which had been\r\n    built for the purpose. The room had a small skylight in the\r\n    roof, and a window about a foot and a half square in the\r\n    gable, just above the bed, which admits of being partially\r\n    opened, but which was closed at the time of my visit, and, as\r\n    he (Evan Roberts) stated, was seldom opened. The room felt\r\n    very close and damp. There was no fireplace, or any other\r\n    means of ventilation except the door and window. The approach\r\n    to the room was through a sort of scullery, and very dark and\r\n    obscure. Evan Roberts was lying on a chaff bed on a wooden\r\n    bedstead, to which both his legs were chained, by fetters\r\n    fastened and riveted, just above his ankles.... The\r\n    appearance of the poor man was pale and pasty, like a plant\r\n    long deprived of air and solar influence. His bodily health\r\n    is tolerably good, and his condition rather inclined to be\r\n    fat and stout; he said his appetite was good, and that he was\r\n    not stinted in his food, such as it was. During a lengthened\r\n    interview, and a very close examination, I failed to discover\r\n    the existence of any hallucination or delusion of any kind;\r\n    on the contrary, he was very sensible and intelligent....\r\n\r\n    \"I collected from his mother and sister that Evan Roberts was\r\n    forty-eight years of age; that he had been liable to\r\n    periodical mania for twenty-seven years, and which the mother\r\n    attributed to some injury to his head, received in a rural\r\n    affray; that at first the maniacal paroxysms were unfrequent,\r\n    but that they had become more violent and frequent as he\r\n    advanced in life. About seven years ago, his violence became\r\n    so great, that he threatened to murder his father and\r\n    brother; and it was at that time that he was first chained to\r\n    the bed. This restraint has never been relaxed, although both\r\n    mother and sister admitted that he was perfectly sane and\r\n    harmless for many weeks and months continuously. For the\r\n    first five years he was confined upstairs, and it was only\r\n    about two years ago that he was carried into the shed he now\r\n    occupies.... Finding that the poor fellow was awed by the\r\n    presence of his mother and sister, I requested them to\r\n    retire, as I wished to examine the alleged lunatic free from\r\n    their presence and interference. The mother for some time\r\n    refused to comply with my request; but upon being told that I\r\n    would report her refusal, she very doggedly complied. The\r\n    poor man then became less reserved; he complained bitterly of\r\n    the state in which the room had long been suffered to\r\n    remain....\r\n\r\n    \"The poor man complained that the chaff in his bed was never\r\n    changed, or even shaken, except once, since his confinement\r\n    in the shed; and from the dampness of the room, and the\r\n    warmth of his body, it had become rotten, and like a wet\r\n    sod....\r\n\r\n                                           \"R. LLOYD WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n    \"R. W. S. Lutwidge, Esq.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Commissioners in Lunacy applied to the Lord Chancellor for an order\r\nto visit the farmer's wife mentioned in one of our former reports as\r\nhaving been tied to her bed by a cart rope and her hands secured by a\r\nmuff. She was accordingly visited, and a report upon her case sent to\r\nthe Commissioners, who directed an inquiry to be made with a view to her\r\nremoval to an asylum. The family obtained information of this\r\ninvestigation, and considerable amendment in the treatment of the\r\nlunatic took place before the justices and the medical officer appointed\r\nto visit her arrived, and no order for her removal was made. We have\r\nreason to know that the poor creature is still under restraint, and her\r\nhands secured; she is strapped to a chair, which is fastened to the leg\r\nof a strong table.\"\r\n\r\nWe pass now to 1879, in order that we may consider the changes which had\r\ntaken place during the quinquennium succeeding the year in which we have\r\ngiven a return of the number of insane in England and Wales, and their\r\ndistribution. The following figures are derived from the thirty-third\r\nReport of the Lunacy Commissioners, and exhibit the total number of\r\nregistered lunatics, idiots, and persons of unsound mind on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1879:--In county and borough asylums, 38,871; naval and\r\nmilitary hospitals and Royal India Asylum, 342; Bethlem and St. Luke's\r\nHospitals, 430; other public asylums, 2407; metropolitan licensed\r\nhouses, 2664; provincial, 2049; Broadmoor, 483; workhouses (ordinary),\r\n11,697; metropolitan district asylums, 4308; outdoor paupers, 6230;\r\nprivate single patients, 472; total, 69,885; exclusive of 202 Chancery\r\nlunatics in the charge of committees.\r\n\r\nOn the next page will be found the general distribution and numbers of\r\nthe insane, January 1, 1881. A more detailed statement will be given, in\r\nthe Appendix (K I.), of the county asylums and lunatic hospitals now\r\nexisting for the care and cure of the insane, with the numbers confined\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1881, the proportion per cent. maintained in\r\nasylums, hospitals, and licensed houses was 64.91; in workhouses, 25.72;\r\nand as outdoor paupers, 9.37.\r\n\r\nAs some of the tables of the Commissioners extend back twenty-three\r\nyears, exhibiting the number, sex, classification, and distribution of\r\nall registered lunatics, January 1, 1859-1881, as also the ratio of the\r\ntotal insane to the total population, we may derive much valuable\r\ninformation for the purpose of our historical review.\r\n\r\nThus there were in England and Wales:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------+------------------+-----------------\r\n              Location.          |    Patients.     |    Patients.\r\n                                 |      1859.       |      1881.\r\n  -------------------------------+------------------+-----------------\r\n  In county and borough asylums  |      15,844      |  41,355\r\n  In registered hospitals        |       1,855      |   2,948\r\n  In metropolitan private asylums|       2,551      |   2,511\r\n  In provincial     \"       \"    |       2,465      |   2,115\r\n  In naval and military hospitals|                  |\r\n    and Royal India Asylum       |         164      |     307\r\n  In Broadmoor Asylum for        |    Not opened    |     491\r\n    criminal lunatics            |    till 1863     |\r\n  In workhouses--                |                  |\r\n    Ordinary workhouses          |       7,963      |  12,093\r\n    Metropolitan district asylums|     Not opened   |   4,718\r\n                                 |     till 1870    |\r\n  Residing with relatives or     |       5,920      |   6,575\r\n    others (pauper and private)  |                  |\r\n                                 +------------------+-----------------\r\n                                 |M. 16,756}        |M. 32,973}\r\n                          Total  |F. 20,006} 36,762 |F. 40,140} 73,113\r\n  -------------------------------+------------------+-----------------\r\n\r\nOf the 36,762 in 1859, 4980 were in private and 31,782 pauper patients.\r\nOf the 73,113, in 1881, 7741 were private and 65,372 pauper patients. In\r\n1859 the ratio of the total registered lunatics to the population (per\r\n10,000) was 18.67, the ratio of private lunatics to population being\r\n2.53, and of pauper lunatics to population 16.14. In 1881 the ratio of\r\nthe total lunatics of the population was 28.34, the ratio of private\r\nlunatics to 25.34. These figures bring out very distinctly the fact that\r\nthe great increase of lunatics during the period between 1859 and 1881\r\nis among the poor. It must, however, be repeated that insanity itself\r\nbrings with it pauperism to many who have once been independent and\r\neducated, but who fall, through the misfortune entailed by the malady,\r\ninto the category of paupers.\r\n\r\nAn important table, introduced for the first time into the last Report\r\nof the Commissioners, shows the annual ratio of fresh admissions to the\r\npopulation; hence the transfers and the admissions into idiot asylums\r\nare excluded. The value of this table consists in this--that, although\r\nthe gross admissions into asylums have increased, due in part to the\r\ncapitation grant of four shillings introduced in 1874, the ratio of the\r\nyearly increase of the fresh admissions to the population has been\r\nslight, showing, as the Commissioners observe, that the total number of\r\nthe insane under care during the twelve years embraced by the table is\r\n\"mainly due to accumulation, and not to a greater annual production of\r\ninsanity.\"[208] This table does not include workhouses.\r\n\r\nThus:--\r\n\r\n  -------+-------------+-------------------\r\n         |             | Ratio per 10,000\r\n   Year. | Admissions. | of admissions to\r\n         |             |  the population.\r\n  -------+-------------+-------------------\r\n   1869  |   10,472    |      4.71\r\n   1870  |   10,219    |      4.54\r\n   1871  |   10,528    |      4.62\r\n   1872  |   10,604    |      4.59\r\n   1873  |   11,212    |      4.80\r\n   1874  |   11,912    |      5.03\r\n   1875  |   12,442    |      5.19\r\n   1876  |   12,857    |      5.30\r\n   1877  |   12,969    |      5.28\r\n   1878  |   13,343    |      5.36\r\n   1879  |   13,101    |      5.20\r\n   1880  |   13,240    |      5.19\r\n  -------+-------------+-------------------\r\n\r\nIt would thus appear that in 1880 scarcely one patient more per 20,000\r\npersons in England and Wales was freshly admitted into asylums, etc. Had\r\nthere been no increase at all, after allowing for increase of\r\npopulation, the number admitted in 1880 would have been 12,011. It was,\r\nin fact, 13,240, _i.e._ 1229 more.\r\n\r\nTaking the actual number of the insane in detention during the same\r\nyears shows a very different result, for accumulation is here included,\r\nand swells the returns.\r\n\r\nThus:--\r\n\r\n  -------+-------------+-------------------\r\n         |             | Ratio per 10,000\r\n   Year. | Under care. |   of number in\r\n         |             |  detention to the\r\n         |             |    population.\r\n  -------+-------------+-------------------\r\n   1869  |   53,117    |     23.93\r\n   1870  |   54,713    |     24.31\r\n   1871  |   56,755    |     24.91\r\n   1872  |   58,640    |     25.42\r\n   1873  |   60,296    |     25.82\r\n   1874  |   62,027    |     26.23\r\n   1875  |   63,793    |     26.64\r\n   1876  |   64,916    |     26.78\r\n   1877  |   66,636    |     27.14\r\n   1878  |   68,538    |     27.57\r\n   1879  |   69,885    |     27.77\r\n   1880  |   71,191    |     27.94\r\n  -------+-------------+-------------------\r\n\r\nIn other words, there were eight more patients under care for every\r\n20,000 of the population in 1880 than in 1869. Had there been no\r\nincrease in the number in detention, after allowing for increase of\r\npopulation, the number in 1880 would have been 53,177. It was, in fact,\r\n71,191, _i.e._ 18,014 more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now traced step by step the remarkable progress effected in the\r\nasylum care of our lunacy population. In concluding this chapter I\r\nwould, however, observe that it would be a grave and mischievous mistake\r\nto suppose that, most valuable as is the provision for the insane by\r\nasylums, there are not many cases which may be treated outside these\r\ninstitutions with the greatest advantage. Some patients are best cared\r\nfor in their own homes, others in lodgings, and others in the houses of\r\nmedical men. The extent to which non-asylum treatment can be carried out\r\nwill be seen when we speak of Chancery patients. It will be observed\r\nthat the number of single private patients is 448.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the location of pauper lunatics in private dwellings, it\r\nappears that while in England 6799, or 9.29 per cent., of their number\r\nlive with their relatives or are boarded in private dwellings, nearly\r\nfifteen per cent. of insane paupers in Scotland are in private\r\ndwellings, inspected by the Lunacy Board.\r\n\r\nDr. Lockhart Robertson has expressed the opinion that \"the utmost limits\r\nwithin which the county asylum can benefit, or is needed for the\r\ntreatment of the insane poor, is fifty per cent. of their number, and\r\nthat a further accumulation of lunatics there serve no practical\r\npurpose, and hence is an unjustifiable waste of public money.\"[209]\r\nAfter pointing out the success of the metropolitan district asylums at\r\nLeavesden and Caterham, where upwards of four thousand chronic lunatics\r\nare maintained at the rate of seven shillings a week, he expresses his\r\nopinion that, if these arrangements were properly carried out, another\r\nfourteen per cent., or forty per cent. of the incurable and harmless\r\npauper lunatics and idiots, might be placed in workhouses; his ideal\r\nstandard for the distribution of pauper lunatics being--in county\r\nasylums, fifty per cent.; in workhouse wards, forty per cent.; leaving\r\nten per cent. for care in private dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe number of beds in county and borough asylums amounts to 40,000,\r\nvarying from 2000 to 250; the average cost per bed having been somewhat\r\nunder L200, and the weekly maintenance and clothing of each patient 9s.\r\n9-1/4d. If to this be added the interest on the cost of construction and\r\nasylum repair, the annual cost for each pauper lunatic in county asylums\r\namounts to about L40.\r\n\r\nThe number of patients discharged cured, in county and borough asylums\r\nduring the ten years 1871-1880, was 40.32 per cent. on the admissions,\r\nand the mortality 10.46 on the mean number resident.\r\n\r\nThe number of beds in registered lunatic hospitals (about 3000) ranges\r\nfrom 60 to 570, or, excluding idiot asylums, to 300, while the average\r\nweekly cost ranges from 14s. to L2 2s. The charges on the buildings are\r\nnot included. For these Dr. Robertson adds five shillings a week, making\r\nthe average weekly cost of maintenance L1 10s. or, including asylum\r\nconstruction and repairs, L1 15s.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of private patients, numbering 7741, was as follows on\r\nthe 1st of January, 1881:--In registered hospitals, 2800, or 36.17 per\r\ncent.; in county asylums, 539, or 6.96 per cent.; in State asylums, 534,\r\nor 6.88 per cent.; in private asylums, 3420, or 44.17 per cent.; in\r\nprivate dwellings, 448, or 5.78 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe registered hospitals have, therefore, thirty-six per cent. of all\r\nthe private patients, an important fact in looking to the future\r\nprovision for this class in lieu of private asylums. Their statistics of\r\nrecovery and mortality are satisfactory. The recoveries per cent.\r\ncalculated on the admissions were 46.48 per cent. during the ten years\r\n1871-1880; the annual mortality being 7.96 per cent.\r\n\r\nAs regards private asylums, there were forty-four per cent. of the\r\nprivate patients in England and Wales cared for in these establishments.\r\nThe recoveries per cent. in private asylums during the decennial period\r\n1871-1880 were--in the metropolitan division 31.43, and in the\r\nprovincial 35.11; the annual mortality being, in the metropolitan\r\nprivate asylums 10.93, and in the provincial asylums 8.63. It should be\r\nremembered, in contrasting these figures with those of registered\r\nhospitals, that a considerable number of pauper patients are still sent\r\nto private houses, and it may therefore be said that, so far as\r\ndifference in social position affects recovery and death, the comparison\r\nis not altogether fair. At the same time, it is noteworthy that in the\r\npauper asylums, the percentage of recovery is higher than in the\r\nmetropolitan and provincial private asylums, and the percentage of\r\nmortality lower than in the licensed houses of the metropolis.\r\n\r\nNumerous general considerations arise from a retrospect of the history\r\nwhich this and the preceding chapter contain, but they will more fitly\r\nform a part of a subsequent chapter of this volume, when a sketch of the\r\nresults achieved by Psychological Medicine will be given, as presented\r\nin the author's Presidential Address at University College.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[178] \"A Lecture on the Management of Lunatic Asylums,\" etc., by Robert\r\nGardiner Hill.

III., c. 94). It was partially repealed in 1838 (1 and 2\r\nVict., c. 14); that is to say, so far as the former authorized\r\nmagistrates to commit to jails or houses of correction, persons\r\napprehended under circumstances denoting derangement of mind and the\r\npurpose of committing a crime. The Act of 1838 made other provisions for\r\nthe safe custody of such persons. Persons in custody under the repealed\r\nprovision of the previous Act, or hereafter apprehended as insane or\r\ndangerous idiots, might be sent to a lunatic asylum, hospital, or\r\nlicensed house; two justices of the place where such person is\r\napprehended having called to their assistance a medical man, and having\r\nsatisfied themselves that he is insane or a dangerous idiot; nothing,\r\nhowever, herein contained preventing the relations from taking lunatics\r\nunder their own care.\r\n\r\nThis Act did not alter the laws relating to the discharge of persons\r\nceasing to be insane, or dangerous idiots, from any county asylum,\r\nhospital, or licensed house.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 an Act was passed (3 and 4 Vict., c. 54) \"for making further\r\nProvision for the Confinement and Maintenance of Insane Prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nIt was enacted that if any person while in prison under sentence of\r\ndeath, transportation, or imprisonment, or under a charge of any\r\noffence, or for not finding bail, or in consequence of any summary\r\nconviction, or under any other civil process, shall appear to be insane,\r\nit shall be lawful for two justices to inquire, with the aid of two\r\nmedical men, as to the insanity of such person; and if it be duly\r\ncertified by such justices and medical men that he is insane, it shall\r\nbe lawful for one of the principal Secretaries of State to direct his\r\nremoval to such county asylum or other proper receptacle as the\r\nSecretary of State may judge proper, to remain under confinement until\r\nit shall be duly certified by two medical men to the Secretary of State\r\nthat such person has become of sound mind; whereupon he is authorized,\r\nif such person remain subject to be continued in custody, to issue his\r\nwarrant to the person in whose charge he may be, directing that he shall\r\nbe removed to the prison from whence he has been taken, or if the period\r\nof imprisonment has expired, then he shall be discharged. It was also\r\nenacted that when a person charged with misdemeanors is acquitted on the\r\nplea of insanity, he shall be kept in strict custody during Her\r\nMajesty's pleasure, the jury being required to find specially whether\r\nsuch person was insane at the time of the commission of such offence,\r\nand to declare whether such person was acquitted by them on account of\r\nsuch insanity.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Shaftesbury introduced the subject of the provision for\r\ncriminal lunatics in the House of Lords in 1852, and moved for an\r\nAddress to Her Majesty on the expediency of establishing a State Asylum\r\nfor the care and custody of those who are denominated criminal lunatics.\r\nHe said that the subject had been never propounded before to them in a\r\nspecific form, and the custody of these criminals had been a great bar\r\nto the improvement of public and private asylums. The Commissioners had\r\nalready reported on these evils in 1849, 1850, and 1851. The Government\r\nalone had refused assistance. Having pointed out the four classes into\r\nwhich they are divided, he stated that the statutes by which they were\r\nconfined were three in number, namely, 39 and 40 Geo. III., c. 94; 1 and\r\n2 Vict., c. 14; 3 and 4 Vict., c. 54.\r\n\r\nHe directed attention to a fifth class, those affected with some\r\nderangement of mind, who, unless restrained, were in danger of\r\ncommitting offences. Under the last-named Act, they were treated as\r\ncriminals. Formerly any magistrate could commit them to jail, or other\r\nplace for safe custody under 39 and 40 Geo. III.; but by the Act of 3\r\nand 4 Vict. their condition had been somewhat alleviated, inasmuch as it\r\nrequired that two justices of the peace should commit the parties, under\r\nmedical advice, and that they should not be sent to jail, but to an\r\nasylum or licensed house. None of these parties except those who had\r\nbeen committed by the justices could be again discharged unless by\r\nauthority of the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nIt appears that there were then 439 criminal lunatics in England and\r\nWales (360 males, 79 females); 138 for offences against life, 188 for\r\noffences against property and person, short of attempts to murder, 40\r\nfor misdemeanor, 43 for want of sureties who had become afterwards\r\ninsane, and 30 summarily convicted for minor offences. Of this number\r\nthere were 103 in Bethlem Hospital, 59 in Fisherton House, Salisbury,\r\nand the remainder in various asylums. After adducing reasons for the\r\nnon-association of criminal lunatics with ordinary patients, Lord\r\nShaftesbury insisted that the most efficient remedy was a State asylum;\r\nand that this was confirmed by the success of Dundrum, Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the course of his speech he eulogized the system of treatment--\"the\r\ngreat and blessed glory of modern science\"--adopted by Pinel in France,\r\nand by the York Retreat in England, adding, \"_Oh, si sic omnia!_ It has\r\nbecome the special pursuit of professors of this department of medicine\r\nin the three kingdoms. By the blessing of God it has achieved miracles.\r\nI have, perhaps, a right to say so, having officiated now as a\r\nCommissioner in Lunacy for more than twenty years, and witnessed the\r\ntransition from the very depth of misery and neglect to the present\r\nheight of comfort and ease. The filthy and formidable prison is\r\nconverted into the cleanly and cheerful abode; the damp and gloomy\r\ncourt-yard is exchanged for healthy exercise and labour in the field\r\nand garden. Visit the largest asylum, and you will no longer hear those\r\nfrightful yells that at first terrified and always depressed the boldest\r\nhearts. Mechanical restraint is almost unknown; houses where many were\r\nchained during the day, and hundreds, I will assert, during the night,\r\nhave hardly a strait waistcoat or a manacle in the whole establishment;\r\nand instead of the keeper with his whip and his bunch of leg-locks, you\r\nmay see the clergyman or the schoolmaster engaged in their soothing and\r\neffective occupations.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Derby promised the subject should not be lost sight of, and\r\nthe motion was withdrawn. He said that our criminal lunatics were\r\nmaintained at Bethlem at an annual cost of L34 per head, those at\r\nFisherton House at L30, and throughout the country at L26 per head. A\r\nnew asylum would cost L50,000, perhaps nearer L100,000, and he thought\r\nthat the same discipline and separate treatment might be carried out\r\njust as well in a general as in a State asylum.\r\n\r\nWe pass on to the important Act of 1860 (23 and 24 Vict., c. 75), \"to\r\nmake Better Provision for the Custody and Care of Criminal Lunatics.\"\r\nAfter citing the Acts 39 and 40 Geo. III., c. 94; 3 and 4 Vict., c. 54;\r\n5 and 6 Vict., c. 29; 6 and 7 Vict., c. 26--by the last two Acts of\r\nwhich the Secretary of the State was empowered to order any convict in\r\nPentonville or Millbank prison becoming or found insane during\r\nconfinement to be removed to such lunatic asylum as he might think\r\nproper--and stating in the preamble the expediency of making provision\r\nfor the custody and care of criminal lunatics in an asylum appropriated\r\nto that purpose, this statute enacted that it shall be lawful to provide\r\nan asylum for criminal lunatics, and for the Secretary of State to\r\ndirect to be conveyed to such asylum any person for whose safe custody,\r\nduring her pleasure Her Majesty is authorized to give order, or whom the\r\nSecretary of State might direct to be removed to a lunatic asylum under\r\nany of the before-mentioned Acts, or any person sentenced to be kept in\r\npenal servitude who may be shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of\r\nState to be insane or unfit from imbecility of mind for penal\r\ndiscipline; the Secretary of State being empowered to direct to be\r\nremoved to such asylum any person who, under any previous order of Her\r\nMajesty or warrant of the Secretary of State, may have been placed in\r\nany asylum.\r\n\r\nIt was enacted that nothing in this statute should affect the authority\r\nof the Crown as to making other provision for the custody of a criminal\r\nlunatic, as before the Act was passed.\r\n\r\nOther sections refer to the government and supervision of the asylum,\r\nthe discharge of patients after their term of imprisonment has expired,\r\nand for the visitation of the asylum by the Commissioners in Lunacy.\r\n\r\nFrom this Act sprang the asylum we proceed to describe.\r\n\r\nEvery one who reads the newspaper is familiar with the common expression\r\noccurring in the trials of prisoners who escape punishment on the ground\r\nof insanity, \"To be detained during Her Majesty's pleasure;\" but very\r\nfew would be able to answer the question, What becomes of these persons?\r\nThose who desire to know their destination may incline to accompany us\r\nto Broadmoor in Berkshire, about four miles from the Bracknell station\r\non the South Western Railway, and thirty miles from London. This is the\r\nState Criminal Asylum for England and Wales, and was erected nineteen\r\nyears ago (1863), in conformity with the Act passed in 1860, which, as\r\nwe have seen, provided that criminal lunatics should be separately cared\r\nfor by the State.\r\n\r\nThe site of the institution is well chosen, covers three hundred acres,\r\nand commands an extensive and uninterrupted view. The building is of red\r\nbrick, with a chapel in the centre, and consists of three stories, with\r\ndistinct additional blocks at the extreme end. It is built on the\r\ncorridor plan, with day-rooms, and single and associated dormitories.\r\nThe windows alone indicate, from outside, the character of the building,\r\nbeing protected by strong vertical iron bars. In some parts of the\r\nbuilding, for the females, these bars do not extend to the whole height\r\nof the window, and escape would in such cases not be difficult. In other\r\nparts of this division, and throughout the male division, the windows\r\nare securely protected. In this and other ways the house is more secure\r\nthan it was formerly. I find in regard to escapes that, from the opening\r\nof the asylum in 1863 up to the end of 1877, there have been not more\r\nthan twenty-three. During the last three years there have been none. The\r\nmajority were recaptured on the next or following day; one not till\r\nthree months; and four were never discovered. Four escaped from the\r\nairing-court; three while out with a walking party; and four from\r\nbreaking the window-guard; while one escaped from his bedroom by making\r\nan aperture in the wall. An attendant connived at one patient's escape,\r\nwas prosecuted, and convicted. I may add that prior to the opening of\r\nBroadmoor, the proportion of escapes of criminal lunatics detained in\r\nEngland elsewhere was much greater. The opening of Broadmoor has also\r\naffected the mortality of this class, having reduced it materially. Some\r\nprobably regard this as an actual disadvantage; but whatever political\r\neconomists may say, medical science only sanctions, as yet at least, the\r\nadoption of that course of hygiene and treatment which most conduces to\r\nthe prolongation of human life.\r\n\r\nThere were, when I visited Broadmoor, 500 inmates--400 men and 100\r\nwomen, or thereabouts. When we consider that of these unfortunate\r\npeople, more than 300 have either murdered some one, or attempted to\r\nmurder or maim some one, it may well cause reflection, alike sad and\r\nphilosophical, on what a disordered brain may lead its possessor to do,\r\nwhat acts to commit. Ninety had killed their own children as well as, in\r\nsome instances, the wife or husband; upwards of twenty, their wives;\r\neight, their mothers; four, their fathers; and one, both parents. And\r\nanother reflection may be made, to the credit of the institution, that\r\nno case of actual murder has occurred since it was opened, and that,\r\ntaking the year before we write, good order was maintained, no\r\npremeditated act of violence was committed, and there was no suicide.\r\n\r\nAnd yet no mechanical restraint was resorted to, no fetters, no strait\r\nwaistcoats, no leg-locks or straps. Some patients are, of course,\r\nsecluded in a single room in which a bed made on the floor is the only\r\nfurniture allowed, and in which the window is protected by a shutter if\r\nthe patient breaks glass. The room is, when the shutter is closed, only\r\npartially dark, as there are two small windows near the ceiling, out of\r\nthe patient's reach. By the side of the door is an inspection plate, or\r\nnarrow slit in the wall, with a movable glazed frame, opening outwards,\r\nthrough which the occupant of the room can be observed when necessary.\r\nThese rooms are well ventilated, and are warmed by means of hot water. I\r\nshould not proceed further without stating that, in addition to the\r\nclass of cases to which I referred in the beginning of this\r\npaper--those, viz., detained during Her Majesty's pleasure, including\r\nthose certified to be insane while awaiting their trial, or found insane\r\non arraignment, or acquitted on the ground of insanity, or reprieved on\r\nthis ground immediately after their sentence--besides these there are\r\nconvicts who become insane while undergoing their penal servitude. As a\r\nrule, however, male convicts of this class are no longer sent to\r\nBroadmoor; the superintendent[210] having discovered that it was\r\nnecessary to keep insane convicts distinct from the other class, to\r\nsecure their safe detention more completely and certainly; that is to\r\nsay, to separate lunatic criminals from criminal lunatics, or, as they\r\nare usually called, \"Queen's pleasure men\"--a distinction sometimes\r\nreally as important as that which exists between a horse-chestnut and a\r\nchestnut horse. It will be readily understood that the convicts--really\r\ncriminals, and often desperate criminals, they are--may differ widely\r\nfrom those who in an access of insanity have committed a crime, and that\r\nmen who leave prison discipline at Pentonville, or elsewhere, to enjoy\r\nthe comparative comfort of asylum life at Broadmoor, are very likely\r\neither to sham madness in order to stay there, or escape in order to\r\navoid having to complete, on recovery, their term of servitude. Anything\r\nbetter than _that_. In insisting on this distinct classification and\r\naccommodation, Dr. Orange did not, in the first instance, intend, I\r\nsuppose, to prevent the convict class being provided for at Broadmoor;\r\nbut having set the ball in motion, it went on and on; and instead of an\r\nadditional building being erected for the convict men, a regulation was\r\nmade in 1874 preventing their being sent in future to Broadmoor. For the\r\nwomen of this class there was and is ample room, an additional wing\r\nhaving been erected fifteen years ago.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is a reason, on the side of the prison authorities, why\r\nconvicts when insane should not be sent to Broadmoor. They are naturally\r\nunwilling that the history of their previous treatment should be known\r\nand scrutinized at another place. Hence they greatly prefer retaining\r\nthem in the prisons, or sending them to one in which provision has been\r\nspecially made for insane convict men.\r\n\r\nIt will probably occur to some to ask whether many or any of those who\r\nare \"Queen's pleasure men\" (or women) are found to have been improperly\r\nacquitted when subjected to the careful and prolonged medical scrutiny\r\nwhich a residence at Broadmoor allows of; whether, in short, mercy,\r\nbased on medical knowledge, has mistakenly interfered with the proper\r\naction of justice and law? In this matter the doctors and the lawyers\r\nare frequently on opposite sides, and the former often find it hard work\r\nto rescue an insane prisoner from the clutches of the law. On the other\r\nhand, it may be admitted that, as regards some physicians at least, a\r\njuster view is sometimes as necessary as it is on the part of the\r\nlawyers. When absurd reasons are given in the witness-box for a\r\nprisoner's insanity--reasons which would equally establish the madness\r\nof many persons in society whom no one regards as insane--it is not\r\nsurprising that the judges are cautious in admitting the plea of\r\ninsanity on medical evidence. In seeking a reply to the above question,\r\nit is satisfactory to find that if the evidence of medical experts tends\r\nto induce juries to acquit on the ground of insanity those who are\r\nresponsible agents and ought to be punished, there have only been a few\r\nscattered cases admitted which were \"doubtful\"--whether at Bethlem, when\r\ncriminal lunatics were sent there, before Broadmoor existed, or at the\r\nlatter, since it was opened. It is also a satisfaction to know that\r\ncases of this kind have not been more frequent of late than formerly;\r\nand this, although there has been in the present generation a marked\r\nincrease in the number acquitted on the ground of insanity. Thus from\r\n1836 to 1848, the ratio of the insane to the prisoners tried was only\r\none in thirty-two; between 1848 and 1862 it was one in seventeen; and\r\nbetween 1862 and 1874 as many as one in fourteen.[211] It is surely much\r\nbetter that a man should occasionally escape the punishment he deserves,\r\nthan that any should be punished who labour under mental disease. To\r\nshow the difficulty of arriving at a conclusion as to the mental\r\nresponsibility of persons charged with crime, I may mention the case of\r\na schoolmaster who, not many years ago, used his cane on a boy in a very\r\nsavage manner, pursued him under the table, and destroyed the sight of\r\none eye. This man was sentenced to five years' penal servitude. He was,\r\nof course, under the notice of the surgeon of the prison to which he was\r\nsent, and was regarded by him as sane. The schoolmasters and\r\npupil-teachers, however, took the case up, and agitated for further\r\nexamination into the state of the man's mind. Dr. Orange was employed to\r\nexamine him, and, thoroughly familiar with criminal lunatics, succeeded\r\nin discovering unmistakable proofs of insanity. In fact, he was so\r\npoorly the morning of the day he committed this assault, so\r\nuncomfortable in his head, and so irritable in mind, that he sent word\r\nto the school to say that he was too ill to attend to his duties. It was\r\na school examination, however, and the authorities insisted upon his\r\ngoing. They therefore were mainly to blame for the circumstance which\r\nfollowed. This man was saved from punishment by Dr. Orange's\r\nrepresentations, and subsequent observation confirmed the opinion he\r\nformed at the time, that he was not only irritable and suspicious, but\r\nwas labouring under a delusion. He was a dangerous lunatic, in short,\r\nwhen he committed the offence.\r\n\r\nIn going through the wards I conversed with the superintendent on the\r\nmain points of interest in connection with the management of the\r\ninstitution, and on some of the characteristics presented by those who\r\nare admitted.\r\n\r\nI remarked on the low mortality which I knew obtained there. \"Ah,\" said\r\nthe doctor, laughing, \"that goes against us, rather than for us. We are\r\nblamed for keeping the patients too well!\" Since the opening of the\r\nasylum, the yearly average of death has been at the rate of 2.97 per\r\ncent. of the number resident. As to diet it is no doubt difficult to\r\nunderstand why this class should fare better, as they seem to do, than\r\nordinary patients in the county asylums. In one particular, indeed, a\r\nchange in the direction of economy has been made, and a very reasonable\r\nchange it is. It is connected with an important question which arises,\r\nHow far can the system of rewards for work be beneficially carried out?\r\n\r\nIt appears that until some ten years ago, the main reward for useful\r\nwork was a luncheon of bread-and-cheese and beer in the forenoon, with\r\nanother, though smaller, allowance of beer in the afternoon. Both these\r\nallowances of beer (which were additional to the dinner supply) were\r\ndiscontinued in 1875, and in lieu of them a small portion of the money\r\nvalue of the work done was credited to the workers, with permission to\r\nspend it on any trifling luxury they might desire. It was found that the\r\nexecuted value of the work in the shoemakers' shop in 1876 was more\r\nthan that done in 1873 (the year before this experiment was tried), by\r\n160 per cent., whilst in the tailors' shop the increase was 120 per\r\ncent.; corresponding results being obtained in other departments. Hence,\r\nin spite of the gratuities to the patients so employed, the yearly cost\r\nhas been considerably reduced. During one year the saving _in beer\r\nalone_ amounted to L165, whilst the saving in paid labour was very much\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nFinancial considerations must be a very important practical point in the\r\nexistence of Broadmoor. The State pays for it; an annual grant from the\r\nHouse of Commons must be asked for, and the Government must be prepared\r\nto show that the amount is not unreasonable. Now the weekly cost of the\r\ninmates is eighteen shillings each. That of the inmates of our county\r\nasylums averages about half a guinea. It may therefore not unreasonably\r\nbe asked, Why is this? What have the criminal lunatics done to deserve\r\nso much more money being lavished upon them? The chief reason is, that a\r\ngreater proportion of attendants must be provided for this class, and\r\nthat is costly. At Broadmoor the proportion of attendants to patients is\r\none in five; in asylums generally, much less liberal, say one in eleven;\r\nbesides which, they are paid better (as they ought to be), at Broadmoor.\r\nTen years ago the cost per head was as high as twenty-three shillings a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of the inmates are, as has been intimated,\r\nusefully employed. Thus, during the year, 167 men and women were\r\noccupied in one way or other, in addition to reading and writing,\r\nmusic, etc. Eighty-six were employed in making and repairing clothing\r\nfor patients, and bed and house linen for patients and attendants; 144\r\nin cleaning the wards; 40 in the garden and on the farm; 29 in the\r\nlaundry; 26 in making or repairing uniform clothing, boots and shoes,\r\netc.; 17 in making and repairing furniture, mattresses, mats, carpets,\r\netc. I went into one room where there was a printing-press, and a\r\nprinter handed me the printed programme of a concert shortly to be held\r\nin the asylum. The total value of the labour of patients alone amounted,\r\nin 1881, to L2835.\r\n\r\nIn the carrying out of a system of labour so beneficial to the patient,\r\nand so useful to the institution, relaxation and amusement are not\r\nforgotten. The patients play at chess, draughts, billiards, bagatelle,\r\netc.; and out-of-door games comprise bowls, cricket, and croquet. There\r\nis a library well supplied with papers and journals; and one patient was\r\npointed out who himself contributes to a magazine. There is a band which\r\nincludes seventeen patients, as well as some attendants, and enlivens\r\nthe inmates twice in the course of the week.\r\n\r\nThis sounds very pleasant, but honesty requires us to give the other\r\nside of the picture, as portrayed in the words of Mr. Burt, the\r\nchaplain; and perhaps nothing serves better to show how much credit is\r\ndue to the superintendent for the admirable management of an institution\r\ncontaining such elements as these. He said (some years ago) that\r\nalthough he had laboured in asylums and prisons for a long period, it\r\nhad never fallen to his lot before to witness depravity and unhappiness\r\nin such aggravated forms. \"In other asylums, when the mind resumes\r\nanything like healthy action, there is hope of discharge; in prisons,\r\nthe period of detention, however long, has some definite duration; but\r\nhere the fear of relapse, and the terrible acts to which relapse may\r\nlead, render the condition of release rarely attainable; for many the\r\nperiod of detention is indefinite, and hope is almost excluded. In\r\nprison, whatever may be the depravity, it is kept under some restraint\r\nby reason and by fear of consequences; but here there are patients with\r\npassions depraved to the utmost, upon whom neither reason, nor shame,\r\nnor fear impose any restraint.\"\r\n\r\nOne Sunday, about fifteen years ago, during the Communion, and when the\r\nchaplain was in the middle of the Collect for the Queen, an event took\r\nplace, the account of which I take from his own description. A patient\r\nwith a sudden yell rushed at Dr. Meyer (then the superintendent), who\r\nwas kneeling, surrounded by his family, close to the altar, and a deadly\r\nblow was struck at his head with a large stone slung in a handkerchief.\r\nThe stone inflicted a serious injury, and the blow would have been\r\nfatal, if it had not been somewhat turned aside by the promptness with\r\nwhich the arm of the patient was seized by an attendant. A scene of so\r\ndreadful a character has very rarely been witnessed in a Christian\r\nchurch. Is it surprising that Mr. Burt cannot look back upon this\r\noccurrence without horror, and that he has never felt able to say the\r\nparticular collect which was interrupted in so awful a manner?\r\n\r\nMany are the moral lessons which might be enforced from a knowledge of\r\nthe cases admitted at Broadmoor, and their previous history. Among these\r\nthe evil of gross ignorance might well be illustrated by such an example\r\nas this. Six years ago a farm labourer was tried in Warwickshire, for\r\nmurdering a woman eighty years of age.\r\n\r\nHe believed in witches and laboured under the delusion that this poor\r\nold creature, with others in the village, held him under the spell of\r\nwitchcraft. Returning from his work one day, and carrying a pitchfork in\r\nhis hand, he saw this woman. He immediately ran at her, struck her on\r\nthe legs thrice, and then on the temple, till he knocked her down. From\r\nthese injuries she died. Well, it was found that he had the delusion\r\nthat he was tormented by witches, to which he attributed his bodily\r\nailments, and was ever ready with Scripture quotations in favour of\r\nwitchcraft. His mind, apart from delusions, was weak. The jury acquitted\r\nhim on the ground of insanity, and he was admitted at Broadmoor in\r\nJanuary, 1876.\r\n\r\nOne lesson there is which ought to be learnt from the history of many of\r\nthe cases sent to Broadmoor, and that is the extreme importance of not\r\ndisregarding the early symptoms of insanity. Had these been promptly\r\nrecognized, and those who suffered from them been subjected to medical\r\ncare and treatment, the acts they committed, the suffering they caused,\r\nthe odium they brought upon themselves and their families, would alike\r\nhave been prevented. The diffusion of a knowledge of the first\r\nindications of this insidious disease, and of what it may culminate in,\r\nis the only safeguard against the terrible acts which from time to time\r\nstartle the community, and which are found, when too late, to have been\r\nperpetrated by those who ought to have been under medical restraint.\r\n\r\nBearing immediately upon this, is the fact that there were recently, out\r\nof the cases of murder in Broadmoor, twenty-nine cases in which insanity\r\nhad been recognized before the act was committed, but the persons were\r\nregarded as harmless, and thirty-three in which it was not regarded as\r\nharmless, but insufficient precautions were taken. In seventy-five cases\r\nno one had possessed sufficient knowledge to recognize it at all.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that although the utility and success of\r\nBroadmoor are so great, all has been done in the way of protecting\r\nsociety which the necessity of the case requires. Far from it. There are\r\na vast number of weak-minded persons at large, most dangerous to the\r\ncommunity, some of whom have not yet been in prison, while others have.\r\nIn 1869 there were in Millbank one hundred and forty weak-minded, and\r\nalso twenty-five of an allied type, the \"half sharp.\" Whether they have\r\nbeen imprisoned or not, they ought to be placed under supervision of\r\nsome kind.\r\n\r\nTwo other practical suggestions: The number of instances in which life\r\nis sacrificed, and the still larger number of instances in which threats\r\nof injury or damage short of homicide, destroy family happiness, through\r\nthe lunacy of one of its members, renders it highly desirable that\r\ngreater facilities should exist for placing such persons under restraint\r\n(we do not refer now to imbeciles) before a dreadful act is committed,\r\nto say nothing of terminating the frightful domestic unhappiness. In\r\nmost of these cases there is but slight apparent intellectual disorder,\r\nalthough careful investigation would frequently discover a concealed\r\ndelusion, and the greatest difficulty exists in obtaining a certificate\r\nof lunacy from two medical men. They shrink from the responsibility.\r\nNothing is done. Prolonged misery or a terrible catastrophe is the\r\nresult. To avoid this, there might be a power vested in the\r\nCommissioners in Lunacy to appoint, on application, two medical men,\r\nfamiliar with insanity, to examine a person under such circumstances.\r\nTheir certificate that he or she ought to be placed under care should be\r\na sufficient warrant for admission into an asylum, and they should not\r\nbe liable to any legal consequences. It should not be necessary for the\r\nsigners of the certificate to comply with the usual formalities. The\r\nCommissioners should have power to grant an application of this kind,\r\nwhether made by a member of the family or by a respectable inhabitant of\r\nthe place in which the alleged lunatic resides; his respectability, if\r\nnecessary, being attested by the mayor.\r\n\r\nThe other suggestion has reference to the strange and clumsy way in\r\nwhich the English law goes to work to discover whether a man charged\r\nwith crime and suspected to be insane is so in reality. It is a chance\r\nin the first place whether he is examined by a medical man at all. If he\r\ncan afford counsel, and the plea of insanity is set up, medical\r\ntestimony is adduced of a one-sided character, and, more likely than\r\nnot, counter medical evidence is brought forward by the prosecution.\r\nThus physicians enter the court as partisans, and being in a false\r\nposition, often present an unfortunate spectacle; while, worst of all,\r\nthe truth is not elicited.\r\n\r\nThen, it not unfrequently happens that after the trial the thing is done\r\nwhich should have been done previously; experts in insanity are employed\r\nto decide upon the prisoner's state of mind. The court should call such\r\nexperts to their assistance at the trial, and, what is most important,\r\nample time should be allowed to examine the suspected lunatic. In France\r\nthe \"Juge d'instruction\" requests neutral experts to examine and report\r\nupon the accused, and I have recently been assured by physicians in\r\nParis, with whom I have discussed this point, that the plan, on the\r\nwhole, works well. Is it too much to hope that common sense will guide\r\nour own law-makers to introduce a similar practice?[212]\r\n\r\nDuring the meeting of the International Medical Congress, 1881, a party\r\nof distinguished men from other lands visited Broadmoor, including MM.\r\nFoville and Motet, Professors Hitchcock, Ball, Tamburini, Dr. Mueller,\r\nand Dr. Whitmer. We shall always remember the day with pleasure. One\r\nresult was an interesting narrative of the visit by M. Motet of Paris.\r\nWe met at \"Waterloo,\" and it was gratifying to think of the different\r\nfeelings under which representatives of the French and English\r\nassembled, from those experienced on the battle-field to which the\r\nstation owes its name.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[210] Dr. William Orange.\r\n\r\n[211] _Journal of the Statistical Society_, vol. xxxviii.

It may\r\nhave been true that \"the Court of Chancery gives to moneyed might the\r\nmeans abundantly of wearying out the right; so exhausts finances,\r\npatience, courage, hope; so overthrows the brain and breaks the heart;\r\nthat there is not an honourable man among its practitioners who would\r\nnot give--who does not often give--the warning, 'Suffer any wrong that\r\ncan be done you, rather than come here!'\" But whatever this \"most\r\npestilent of hoary sinners\" may have been in the past, it has, through\r\nits Lord Chancellor's Visitors, performed its duty towards its \"worn-out\r\nlunatics,\" not only \"in every mad-house,\" but in many a home in which\r\nthey enjoy as much liberty as possible, while the property of which they\r\nare incompetent to take charge, is carefully administered by the Lord\r\nChancellor. In his Address at the eighth section of the International\r\nCongress, Dr. Lockhart Robertson pointed out that 34.6 per cent. of the\r\nChancery lunatics are treated in private dwellings. Hence 65.4 per cent.\r\nare in asylums--a striking contrast to 94 per cent. of private patients\r\nin asylums under the Lunacy Commissioners. Dr. Robertson concludes that\r\nsome 30 per cent. of these are, therefore, in asylums needlessly, and\r\nhence wrongly. The fact is important, and will attract, it is to be\r\nhoped, more attention than hitherto, although I can hardly see that it\r\nfollows that all these patients referred to are \"wrongly confined,\" or\r\nwould be better elsewhere. I would, however, reiterate what has been\r\ninsisted upon in a former chapter, that, essential as asylums are, a\r\nlarge number of patients may be comfortably placed under other and less\r\nrestrictive conditions.\r\n\r\nBy what steps we have arrived at our present, on the whole, satisfactory\r\nif incomplete, legislation for the protection of the property of the\r\ninsane, is an inquiry by no means unprofitable and uninteresting, and I\r\npropose in a short chapter to trace them rapidly, with a brief reference\r\nto successive Acts of Parliament.[213]\r\n\r\nIt is needful to premise that Blackstone's definition of an idiot was\r\n\"that he is one who hath had no understanding from his nativity, and\r\ntherefore is by law presumed never likely to attain any.\" \"He is not an\r\nidiot if he hath any glimmering of reason, so that he can tell his\r\nparents, his age, or the like common matters.\" From such a condition the\r\nlaw clearly distinguished the lunatic, or _non compos mentis_, who is\r\n\"one who hath had understanding, but by disease, grief, or other\r\naccident hath lost the use of his reason.\" The lunatic was assumed to\r\nhave lucid intervals, these depending frequently, it was supposed, upon\r\nthe change of the moon. Others who became insane--or, as it was\r\nexpressed, \"under frenzies\"--were also comprised under the term _non\r\ncompos mentis_.\r\n\r\nThe law varied in accordance with these distinctions, the charge of the\r\nlunatic being intrusted to the king, and the custody of the idiot and\r\nhis lands vested in the feudal lord, though eventually, in consequence\r\nof flagrant abuses, it was transferred to the Crown in the reign of\r\nEdward I. by an Act now lost, which was confirmed by Edward II., 1324.\r\nThis marks the earliest Act extant (17 Edward II., c. 9) passed for the\r\nbenefit of mentally affected persons. The words run:--\"The king shall\r\nhave the custody of the lands of natural fools, taking the profits of\r\nthem without waste or destruction, and shall find them their\r\nnecessaries, of whose fee soever the lands be holden. And after the\r\ndeath of such idiots he shall render them to the right heirs; so that by\r\nsuch idiots no alienation shall be made, nor shall their heirs be\r\ndisinherited.\"[214]\r\n\r\nThe same Act legislates for lunatics--those who before time had had\r\ntheir wit and memory. \"The king shall provide, when any happen to fail\r\nof his wit, as there are many having lucid intervals, that their lands\r\nand tenements shall be safely kept without waste and destruction, and\r\nthat they and their household shall live and be maintained completely\r\nfrom the issues of the same; and the residue beyond their reasonable\r\nsustentation shall be kept to their use, to be delivered unto them when\r\nthey recover their right mind; so that such lands and tenements shall in\r\nno wise within the time aforesaid be aliened; nor shall the king take\r\nanything to his own use. And if the party die in such estate, then the\r\nresidue shall be distributed for his soul by the advice of the\r\nordinary.\"[215]\r\n\r\nThe necessity had arisen in early times of deciding upon sufficient\r\nevidence whether a man were or were not an idiot, and the old common law\r\nrequired trial by jury. If twelve men found him to be a pure idiot, the\r\nprofits of his lands and person were granted to some one by the Crown,\r\nhaving sufficient interest to obtain them. The king, of course, derived\r\nsome revenue from this source. A common expression used long after the\r\ncustom had died out, \"begging a man for a fool,\" indicated the character\r\nof this unjust law. In James I.'s reign Parliament discussed the\r\nquestion of investing the custody of the idiot in his relations,\r\nallowing an equivalent to the Crown for its loss, but nothing was done.\r\nIt is said[216] that this law was rarely abused, because of the\r\ncomparative rarity of a jury finding a man a pure idiot, that is to say,\r\none from his birth, the verdict generally involving _non compos mentis_\r\nonly, and therefore reserving the property of the lunatic for himself\r\nentire until his recovery, and in the event of his death, for his heirs,\r\nin accordance with the statute of Edward II. already given.\r\n\r\nRecurring to the appointment of a jury, in order to trace the course of\r\nlegislation subsequently to the present time, it should be observed that\r\nthe Lord Chancellor was petitioned to inquire into an alleged idiot or\r\nlunatic's condition, the petition being reported by affidavits; and if\r\nsatisfied of the _prima facie_ evidence, he issued a writ _de idiota_ or\r\n_lunatico inquirendo_ to the escheator or sheriff of his county to try\r\nthe case by jury. The form of this writ was various. It surmised that an\r\nidiot or fatuous person existed, one who had not sufficient power to\r\ngovern himself, his lands, tenements, goods, or cattle, and ordered\r\ninquiry to be made whether such was really the fact, and if so, whether\r\nat another time; if the latter, at what time, and by what means; if\r\nthere were lucid intervals; and who was his next heir, and his\r\nage.[217]\r\n\r\nIn another form it is surmised that a certain person is so impotent and\r\n_non compos mentis_ that he is unable to take care of himself or his\r\ngoods, and inquiry is simply directed to the point whether he is an\r\nidiot and _non compos_, as asserted in the petition.[218]\r\n\r\nAnd in another writ the escheator or sheriff is to inquire whether the\r\nperson in regard to whom the writ is issued has been a pure idiot from\r\nhis birth to the present time; whether through misfortune, or in any\r\nother manner, the patient afterwards fell into this infirmity; and if\r\nso, through what particular misfortune or other cause it happened, and\r\nat what age.[219]\r\n\r\nIf a jury found a man to be an idiot, he had the right to appeal, and to\r\nappear in person or by deputy in the Court of Chancery, and pray to be\r\nexamined there or before the king and his Council at Westminster. Should\r\nthis fresh examination fail to prove him an idiot, the former verdict\r\nbefore the sheriff was declared void.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times three Commissioners appointed by the Lord\r\nChancellor issued a writ _de lunatico inquirendo_. The jury found\r\nwhether the person was or was not insane, and the Lord Chancellor\r\nreceived the verdict through the above Commissioners. In time this\r\ncourse was found inconvenient and cumbrous, and in the reign of William\r\nIV. (stat. 3 and 4, c. 36, s. 1), in the year 1833, the Lord Chancellor\r\nwas authorized to cause commissions \"to be addressed to any one or more\r\npersons to make inquisitions thereon, and return the same into the Court\r\nof Chancery, with the same power as was before possessed by three or\r\nmore Commissioners in such Commission named.\"[220]\r\n\r\nBy stat. 5 and 6 Vict., c. 84, the Lord Chancellor was authorized to\r\nappoint two barristers called \"the Commissioners in Lunacy,\" to whom all\r\nwrits _de lunatico inquirendo_ were to be addressed, and who should\r\nperform the duties then performed by Commissioners named in commissions\r\nin the writ. In 1845 the title was changed from Commissioners to\r\n\"Masters in Lunacy\" (8 and 9 Vict. c. 100). It was previously the\r\npractice to refer all matters connected with the person and estates of\r\nthe lunatic, after he was found so under commission, to the ordinary\r\nMasters in Chancery. These were transferred to the new Masters in\r\nLunacy. All inquisitions were still held before a jury.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that although formerly, when a person was found\r\nto be an idiot or a lunatic, he was placed under a committee appointed\r\nby the king, in the course of time objection was taken to this course\r\non account of the suspicion of partiality attaching to his appointment,\r\nand the king transferred his right to the Lord Chancellor.[221]\r\n\r\nThese Acts direct proceedings for a commission to be taken as\r\nfollows:--The petition for a commission, duly supported by medical and\r\nother affidavits, is to be lodged with the Secretary of Lunatics, for\r\nthe Lord Chancellor's inspection. If satisfactory and unopposed, the\r\npetition is endorsed and the commission issues. If a _caveat_ is\r\nentered, liberty is given to attend and to oppose it, and the inquiry is\r\nheld in the most convenient place. A jury of twenty-four persons is\r\nsummoned to determine the case, by the sheriff, instructed by the Master\r\nin Lunacy. The jury and the Master being assembled, and the former\r\nsworn, the Master in Lunacy is to explain to the jury what they have to\r\ntry; and if the person is found to be a lunatic, the time at which he\r\nbecame so, and whether he has lucid intervals. After counsel have been\r\nheard, and the alleged lunatic examined, the Master is to sum up, and\r\nthe verdict, which must be concurred in by twelve, is then given.\r\n\r\nThe inquisition is now filled up and signed by the twelve jurymen, the\r\nMaster annexing a duplicate copy to the commission; and they are\r\nendorsed with the words, \"The execution of this commission appears by\r\nthe inquisition hereunto annexed.\"[222]\r\n\r\nThen, next in order of legislation comes the Act of 1853 (16 and 17\r\nVict., c. 70). Certain clauses in the Act of 1842, by which the Lord\r\nChancellor exercised jurisdiction on account of the expense involved in\r\na commission, were repealed, having been found to work inconveniently.\r\nUnder the new Act an inquisition was held, in unopposed cases, before a\r\nMaster alone in by far the larger proportion of cases. A petition was to\r\nbe presented by any relative, and in special cases by a stranger,\r\nsupported by medical and other evidence, along with an affidavit of\r\nnotice having been given to the lunatic, calling his attention to the\r\nprovision of the Act under which he could demand a jury. If no such\r\ndemand was made, the documents were to be submitted to the Lord\r\nChancellor or the lords justices, who directed an inquiry, if they saw\r\nno reason for further evidence. If the demand, on the contrary, was\r\nmade, the petition was to be set down for hearing in open court, when an\r\ninquiry was either ordered or dismissed; in the former case, before a\r\njury or without one, at the court's discretion. In the event of the\r\npetition being unopposed, the order made by the Lord Chancellor for\r\ninquiry was to be directed to a Master in Lunacy, and conducted as\r\nnearly as possible as if there were a jury, the lunatic being seen in\r\nevery case. Master Barlow has related one exception in which he could\r\nnot see the lunatic (a lady) without breaking through the door; a\r\nsolicitor appeared on her behalf, and Mr. Barlow tried to make him\r\nproduce his client, but being told that serious risk of her jumping out\r\nof the window would be incurred, the attempt was wisely abandoned. When\r\nsuch an inquiry was completed and the commission signed, the Master in\r\nLunacy was to ascertain certain particulars, as the committees of the\r\nperson and estate which the family proposed to appoint, the amount of\r\nthe property, etc. A report was then to be made to the Lord Chancellor\r\ncertifying these particulars. The Chancery Visitors were to undertake\r\nthe supervision of the lunatic, these consisting of two medical men (as\r\npreviously), a lawyer, and nominally the two Masters _ex officio_. The\r\nvisitation was only annual. The salary of the medical and legal Visitors\r\nwas not more than L500 per annum, as they were not, as now, obliged to\r\nrelinquish practice.\r\n\r\nReference has been made in the fourth chapter to the important Select\r\nCommittee of 1859-60. This Committee not only collected evidence in\r\nregard to \"the Care and Treatment of Lunatics,\" but also in regard to\r\nthe protection of their property. A mass of interesting evidence was\r\ngiven, including a statement of the working of the law at that time by\r\nMaster Barlow. Proof was not wanting that some reforms were required,\r\nand the outcome of this inquiry was \"The Lunacy Regulation Act\" of 1862\r\n(25 and 26 Vict., c. 86), a statute to be construed as part of \"The\r\nLunacy Regulation Act\" of 1853, to which we have already referred.\r\n\r\nThe only novel points in the Act of 1862 which we shall mention here are\r\nthese: That when the Lord Chancellor, entrusted under the previous Act,\r\norders an inquiry before a jury, he may direct the trial to take place\r\nin one of the superior courts of common law at Westminster, the verdict\r\nhaving the same force as an inquisition under a commission of lunacy\r\nreturned into the Court of Chancery; that in an inquiry before a Master\r\nwithout a jury, it shall be lawful for the alleged lunatic, upon the\r\nhearing of any petition, to demand an inquiry by a jury, the demand\r\nhaving the same effect as if made by notice filed with the registrar in\r\naccordance with the previous Act; that the inquiry should be confined to\r\nthe question whether the subject of the inquiry was at the time of such\r\ninquiry of unsound mind, and incapable of managing himself or his\r\naffairs, no evidence as to anything said or done by such person, or as\r\nto his demeanor or state of mind at any time more than two years before,\r\nbeing receivable as a proof of insanity, unless the judge or Master\r\nshall direct otherwise; that to save the property of lunatics, when of\r\nsmall amount, from ruinous expense, the Lord Chancellor, if satisfied by\r\nthe report of a Master or the Commissioners in Lunacy or otherwise, that\r\nany person is of unsound mind and incapable of managing his affairs,\r\nmay, when the lunatic does not oppose the application, and his property\r\ndoes not exceed L1000 in value or L50 per annum, apply it for his\r\nbenefit in a summary manner without directing any inquiry under a\r\ncommission of lunacy; that the Lord Chancellor may apply the property of\r\npersons acquitted on the ground of insanity for their benefit; that\r\nChancery lunatics should be visited four times a year by one of the\r\nVisitors, the interval between such visits not exceeding four months,\r\nwith the exception of those in public or private asylums or hospitals,\r\nwho need not be visited oftener than once a year; that the Visitor\r\nshall report once in six months to the Lord Chancellor the number of\r\nvisits made, the number of patients seen, and the number of miles\r\ntravelled; an annual report being made to Parliament thereof, together\r\nwith a return of sums received for travelling or other expenses; that\r\nthe sections of the former Act in regard to visitation being repealed,\r\ntwo medical and one legal Visitor shall be appointed, with salaries of\r\nL1500 each and a superannuation allowance.\r\n\r\nIn practice, it may be said that, in the first instance, the Court\r\nendeavours to satisfy itself that in the event of an inquiry, it is for\r\nthe benefit of the alleged lunatic, and that there is a fair probability\r\nthat the verdict will find him of unsound mind and incapable of managing\r\nhimself or his affairs, by ordering him to be examined by a medical man,\r\nor by making a personal examination.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that, notwithstanding these various Acts, and\r\nespecially that of 1862, there should still be occasion for improvement\r\nin providing for the care of the property of insane persons. Yet so it\r\nis; and one of the Lord Chancellor's Visitors, Dr. Lockhart Robertson,\r\nhas so recently as 1881 stated that \"the important requisite of a cheap\r\nand speedy method of placing the property of lunatics under the\r\nguardianship of the Lord Chancellor has yet to be attained,\" and he\r\nquoted Master Barlow's evidence before the Dillwyn Committee of 1877: \"I\r\nam a great advocate for a great reform in lunacy (Chancery) proceedings;\r\nI would facilitate the business of the procedure in the office and\r\nshorten it in such a way as to reduce the costs.\" Various important\r\nsuggestions will be found in the evidence given before the above\r\nCommittee by the present Visitors and an ex-Visitor, Dr. Bucknill, who\r\nhas also, in his brochure on \"The Care of the Insane, and their Legal\r\nControl,\" advocated radical changes in the official management of the\r\ninsane. In addition to the establishment of State asylums for the upper\r\nand middle classes, he proposes that two central lunacy authorities\r\nshould administer the laws, severally relating to the rich and the poor.\r\nThe present Board of Commissioners would cease to exist; the Lord\r\nChancellor, under the Royal prerogative, would preside over the\r\nformer--the non-pauper--and the Local Government Board would exercise\r\nauthority over the entire pauper class.

We\r\npropose in this chapter to give some particulars respecting their past\r\nhistory, their numbers, their location, and the claims, not yet\r\nsufficiently recognized, which they have upon the public and the State,\r\nwith a few suggestions in regard to the legislation required to meet\r\nthese claims.\r\n\r\nThe terms \"idiots\" and \"imbeciles\" are popularly employed with great\r\nvagueness, and the latter by even medical men in more senses than one.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks an idiot was a private, as opposed to a public or a\r\nprofessional person. He was unskilled, unlearned; and early English\r\nwriters use it in this sense. Thus Wiclif translates 1 Cor. xiv. 16,\r\n\"For if thou blessist in speyrit; who filleth the place of an _idiot_,\r\nhou schal he sae amen on thi blessyng.\" Chaucer similarly employs the\r\nword. It is easy to understand its gradual transition to the exclusive\r\nsense in which it has for long been employed.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to distinguish between idiocy and imbecility (Lat.,\r\nweakness, feebleness) further than this, that an idiot is at the very\r\nbottom of the scale of beings born with defective mental powers, while\r\nhe who labours under imbecility or feeble mindedness is understood to be\r\none much less completely deprived of power. Strictly speaking, these\r\nterms ought to be rigidly restricted to states of mind at birth, but\r\nthis has been found to be practically inconvenient, if not impossible,\r\nbecause changes occurring in the brain in very early life impair the\r\nfunctions of that organ so completely as to induce the same helpless\r\ncondition which is found in congenital cases. We dismiss now one\r\ndistinction which has been drawn between idiocy and imbecility--that the\r\nformer is, and that the latter is not, necessarily congenital; one\r\narising from the supposition that infantile mental deficiency is less\r\nlikely to be so grave an affection than that which has been present from\r\nthe moment of existence. Besides, the term is constantly being applied\r\nin common parlance to those who, originally of sound mind, have in adult\r\nlife lost their faculties.\r\n\r\nIt is most important that a clear distinction should be preserved\r\nbetween these adult cases and those which date from birth or childhood.\r\nThe former are labouring under _dementia_, not _amentia_. They are\r\ndemented persons, or, as they are called in our asylums, dements. They\r\nare not always, but they are for the most part, harmless lunatics. It is\r\nconfusing to call them imbeciles, now that this term has become\r\nrestricted by medical writers to those who are, or once were,\r\nfeeble-minded children. There are, of course, all degrees of mental\r\ndefect possible at birth or in childhood, between that of the most\r\ndegraded idiot and of a child who is said to be not very bright. With a\r\nlarge majority, however, something can be done to improve the mental\r\ncondition, whereas with demented persons there is no ground for\r\nexpecting improvement. The past history of the condition and treatment\r\nof idiots differs in some respects widely from that of the insane.\r\nHappily in many countries, especially in the East, they have been\r\nregarded as objects of special affection and care--as sacred beings\r\npossessing a certain weird, if not divine, element in their nature.\r\nThough helpless and involving much trouble, they do not exasperate or\r\nterrify their relations in the same way as the furious maniac. As a\r\nrule, they do not suggest the same exercise of force and use of fetters\r\nas the ordinary lunatic. Still, in many instances, no doubt, weak-minded\r\nand wayward children have been harshly treated and beaten.\r\n\r\nBut whether regarded as specially favoured by Heaven, or treated as\r\nstupid children, they were never subjected to any special training for\r\neducation until recent times.\r\n\r\nSt. Vincent de Paul is regarded as the first who made any effort to\r\ntrain idiots. This was in the Priory of St. Lazarus. He failed, however,\r\nas was to be expected, to make much progress in the work. Itard\r\nfollowed, also a Frenchman. He strove to educate the celebrated idiot\r\ncalled the Savage of the Aveyron, and by doing so hoped to solve the\r\nproblem of determining what might be the amount of intelligence and the\r\nnature of the ideas in a boy who from birth had lived entirely separate\r\nfrom human beings. Although he regarded his effort as a failure, he no\r\ndoubt exerted considerable influence in inducing others to make the same\r\nattempt with a more practical aim, and with a better understanding of\r\nthe material upon which it was proposed to work. M. Belhomme published a\r\nwork in 1824 on the subject of educating idiots. Four years later some\r\nwere taught at the Bicetre, and the school there became famous. Falret,\r\nin 1831, adopted the same course at the Salpetriere, but we believe the\r\nschool was not sustained for a long period. Another physician of Paris,\r\nVoisin, taking up the subject as an enthusiastic phrenologist, also\r\nworked hard at idiot-teaching. None, however, devoted themselves so\r\nfully, and for so long to this work as the late Dr. Seguin, who so long\r\nago as 1839 published, with Esquirol, a pamphlet on idiocy, and has only\r\nrecently passed away. For some years he taught idiots in Paris, and in\r\n1846 published a work entitled \"Traitement moral, Hygiene, et Education\r\ndes Idiots.\" He resided for many years in New York, and made, while in\r\nAmerica, valuable contributions to the literature of idiocy.\r\n\r\nAmerica has certainly not been behindhand in her efforts to raise the\r\ncondition of idiots. In 1818 an attempt was made to instruct them at the\r\nAsylum for the Deaf and Dumb at Hartford. It is said they were taught to\r\ncommunicate by the sign language.\r\n\r\nTo George Sumner the credit is due of having called attention powerfully\r\nto the subject in 1845. He had recently visited Paris, and gave a\r\ndescription of the idiot schools there. Dr. Woodward and Dr. Backus\r\nshortly after took up the question; the latter became in that year a\r\nsenator of New York, and in 1846 introduced a Bill providing an idiot\r\nasylum or school. It was five years, however, before one was opened.\r\nThis was at Albany, as an experiment; but it was eventually established\r\nat Syracuse, as the New York Asylum for Idiots. In 1855 a new building\r\nwas erected in New York, the number provided for being 150. The first to\r\nsuperintend the institution was Dr. Hervey B. Wilbur. Accommodation was\r\nsubsequently made for 225. In 1875 the average attendance at this school\r\nwas 210; of these 180 were supported by the State, the remainder paying\r\naltogether or in part. The expenditure was 45,407 dollars; the cost per\r\nhead for board and instruction being 200 dollars.\r\n\r\nAt the same period that New York took the initiative (1846), a\r\ncommission was appointed by the Massachusetts Legislature to inquire\r\ninto the condition of the idiot population of this state, and to report\r\nas to what was necessary to be done. The report being favourable to\r\naction, a wing in the Blind Institution at South Boston was appropriated\r\nto an idiot training school. This was in October, 1848. In 1850 this\r\nschool underwent a transformation, being incorporated as the\r\n\"Massachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-minded Youth,\" and placed\r\nunder the charge of the well-known Dr. S. G. Howe, the instructor of\r\nLaura Bridgman. \"We are happy to say,\" he observes in a report of this\r\nschool, \"that in its experience there have been hardly any so low as to\r\nbe beyond the reach of some elevating influence, none, or next to none,\r\nso fixed in their degradation as to be unrecoverable.\"\r\n\r\nDr. H. B. Wilbur states that no provision is made for a large proportion\r\nof idiots in America; the present training institutions being quite\r\ninadequate to the applications made. The consequence is that many are\r\nplaced in jails or almshouses. Recommendations have been made that these\r\ncustodian cases should have either special asylums provided for them, or\r\nseparate departments connected with lunatic asylums or training idiot\r\ninstitutions. It is calculated that there must be fully 38,000 idiots in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong to pass over Germany without stating that much\r\npersevering and successful work has been accomplished by Herr Saegert\r\nand others. We were more struck with the results he obtained, when we\r\nvisited his school in Berlin in 1853, than with anything we witnessed\r\nelsewhere on the Continent.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland there are training schools at Basle, Berne, Zurich,\r\nLausanne (two), and Etoy. They provide for about eighty cases.[224]\r\n\r\nIn our own country[225] we believe we must signalize Bath as the first\r\ntown in which a school, or rather a home, for idiots was opened.\r\nEstablished on a very small scale (only four cases in the first\r\ninstance) by the Misses White in 1846, it has flourished to the present\r\nday. Two years later, an idiot asylum was established at Park House,\r\nHighgate, whose founders, however, did not know of the home at Bath. It\r\nhad its branch at Colchester, and eventually developed into the great\r\ninstitution at Earlswood, near Redhill, opened in 1855. The Earlswood\r\nreport for the past year states that there are altogether 561 inmates,\r\nof whom 400 are supported gratuitously, and of the remainder upwards of\r\n70 pay less than the actual cost of their maintenance. One of the\r\ninmates discharged in May had since held the situation of nurse in a\r\nfamily; another was becoming an expert shoemaker; and a former female\r\ninmate was employed as a teacher in an elementary school. Earlswood is\r\nunder the efficient charge of Dr. Grabham. In connection with Earlswood,\r\nwe ought to recognize the considerable influence which a continental\r\ninstitution exerted in helping to excite that interest in the education\r\nof idiots which, among other influences, induced the Rev. Andrew Reed,\r\nD.D., to urge the erection of a large building for the training of\r\nidiots. We refer to Dr. Guggenbuehl's institution for cretins, on the\r\nAbendberg, near Interlachen, which undoubtedly did more good in this\r\nindirect way than by curing the cretins placed there. At any rate, there\r\nwas a certain mystery connected with the work done at this school, which\r\nleft an unsatisfactory impression on ourselves when we visited it in\r\n1862, and which struck many others in the same way. At his death, in\r\n1863, the institution was closed. Essex Hall, Colchester, in the first\r\ninstance a branch of the Highgate Asylum, ultimately (1859) became the\r\ninstitution for the eastern counties. Mr. Millard, who has devoted\r\nhimself to the arduous work of training idiots for many years, is the\r\nsuperintendent, and had the original charge (with a matron) of the\r\nidiots when first placed at Park House, Highgate. The inmates number\r\nninety-seven. In 1864 an institution was opened at Starcross, near\r\nExeter, through the efforts of the Earl of Devon, for the idiotic class\r\nin the western counties. There are now eighty pupils there.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the same year the Northern Counties Asylum for Idiots\r\nand Imbeciles was established at Lancaster. Its origin is thus given by\r\nDr. de Vitre, the chairman of the committee: \"A member of the Society of\r\nFriends, with moderate pecuniary means, but possessing a large amount of\r\nChristian benevolence, offered to give the sum of L2000 for the purpose\r\nof erecting an asylum for idiots in Lancashire. The gift was a noble one\r\nand handsomely offered, but useless standing alone.\" Donations were\r\nconsequently solicited, and they were obtained, the result being the\r\nestablishment of the above institution, which now has 445 inmates, and\r\nis under the care of Dr. Shuttleworth.\r\n\r\nDorridge Grove Asylum, at Knowle, was opened in 1866, and, although on\r\nan exceedingly small scale, may be regarded as the institution for the\r\ncentral or midland counties. Its establishment in the first instance was\r\ndue to Dr. Bell Fletcher and Mr. Kimbell.\r\n\r\nWe have now enumerated the institutions for idiots and imbeciles which\r\nare supported in part or altogether by charity. They were, no doubt,\r\nmainly intended, not for the highest, nor yet for the very lowest class\r\nof society, but rather for the upper lower class and the lower middle\r\nclass. This idea has, however, by no means been carried out in practice,\r\nfor, in consequence of the State having failed to make provision for the\r\neducation and training of idiots and imbeciles, charitable institutions\r\nhave become disproportionately filled with persons of a different class\r\nfrom that for which they are properly designed, and the difficulty\r\nattending admission has acted as a barrier to the latter availing\r\nthemselves of the provision intended for them.\r\n\r\nThere are six of these charitable or voluntary institutions in England\r\nand Wales, the number cared for being as follows:--\r\n\r\n                  Under 20          Over 20\r\n                  years of          years of\r\n                    age.              age.\r\n\r\n  Earlswood         295               266\r\n  Lancaster         370                75\r\n  Essex Hall         57                40\r\n  Star Cross         72                 8\r\n  Bath               30                --\r\n  Knowle             45                --\r\n                   ----              ----\r\n                    869               389\r\n\r\nthe total being 1258.\r\n\r\nFor the higher class, an admirable private institution has for some\r\nyears been in operation at Normansfield, near Hampton Wick, under the\r\ncare of Dr. and Mrs. Down, who were formerly at Earlswood. There are\r\nabout one hundred inmates.\r\n\r\nLastly, for the pauper class in the metropolis a school for imbeciles\r\nhas for some time been carried on, first at Clapton, and now at Darenth\r\n(Kent), under the superintendence of Dr. Beach. The house will\r\naccommodate five hundred. It should be stated that this institution, as\r\nwell as those at Caterham and Leavesden for incurable lunatics,\r\noriginated in the Act 30 Vict. c. 6, and that these establishments are\r\nunder the Metropolitan Asylums Board, subject to the Local Government\r\nBoard. There are sixty members, of whom fifteen are nominated by the\r\nlast-mentioned Board, the remainder being elected by the metropolitan\r\nunions.\r\n\r\nTaking the numbers under training in these three divisions, the\r\ncharitable or voluntary institutions, the private institution, and that\r\nfor paupers, we find the total to be somewhat about eighteen hundred.\r\n\r\nScotland and Ireland have various institutions for idiots and imbeciles,\r\nwhich may be briefly enumerated. In the former an idiot school was\r\nestablished at Baldovan, near Dundee, in 1853. It was on the estate of\r\nSir John Ogilvie. There are forty-seven inmates. In 1862 an institution\r\nwas opened at Larbert, Stirlingshire, by a society formed for that\r\nobject, called the \"Scottish National Institution for the Education of\r\nImbecile Children.\" Dr. Brodie, who now, we believe, has a private\r\ninstitution at Liberton, near Edinburgh, for ten pupils, was the first\r\nsuperintendent. It was superintended by Dr. Ireland from 1870 to 1881.\r\nIn January, 1881, there were one hundred and twenty-four inmates.[226]\r\n\r\nThus only about a hundred and eighty idiots and imbeciles are in\r\ntraining institutions in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the only institution for training idiots was founded in\r\n1868, in consequence of Dr. Henry Stewart handing over his asylum at\r\nLucan, together with a donation (payable under certain conditions) of\r\nL5000, to certain trustees. It is called the \"Stewart Institution for\r\nthe Training, Education, and Maintenance of Idiotic and Imbecile\r\nChildren.\"\r\n\r\nA large mansion at Palmerston, in the neighbourhood of Dublin, was in\r\n1875, when we visited it, being adapted to the requirements of an\r\nasylum, and to it the idiots have been removed from Lucan. It was\r\nrecently stated that in Ireland seventy per cent. of the idiots and\r\nimbeciles are at large, twenty-one per cent. in workhouses, and only\r\nseven per cent. in asylums.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to estimate the opportunities afforded in\r\nEngland for the systematic training of a class of unhappy beings, unable\r\nto help themselves and calling loudly for help from both men of science,\r\nphilanthropists, and legislators. Let us see how far these opportunities\r\nmeet the want, and what becomes of those idiots and imbeciles for whom\r\nno distinct provision is made. Unfortunately, the statistics of idiocy\r\nare very imperfect, partly owing to the reluctance of their relatives to\r\nacknowledge such a defect in the family, and partly from there being no\r\ndistinction made in the annual Report of the Lunacy Commissioners\r\nbetween idiots and lunatics.\r\n\r\nTaking, however, the census of 1871, in which a return of idiots was\r\nmade, as the basis, we find the number in England and Wales to be at\r\nthat time 29,452. Inquiry of the parents of known idiots has so often\r\nresulted in the discovery that they had not been returned, that it has\r\nbeen considered fair to add one-fourth to the above figures, thus\r\nbringing them up to 36,815, of whom 14,162 would be under twenty years\r\nof age, and therefore suitable objects for training, and 22,653 twenty\r\nyears old and upwards. To these should be added five per cent. for\r\nincrease of population since 1871, making the numbers, respectively,\r\n14,869 and 23,786, or a total of 38,655, or 1 to 616 of the population.\r\nOf these, then, 1147, or about three per cent., are in training schools\r\nprovided by charity. The remainder are either at home, in lunatic\r\nasylums, workhouses, or boarded out. We have found it impossible to\r\narrive at any satisfactory result in attempting to apportion them to\r\nthese various allotments. We know, however, that the census of 1871\r\ngives 3456 as the number in asylums, and 7976 as the number in\r\nworkhouses, including in the term the metropolitan district asylums.\r\nThis would leave, out of the number of idiots reported by the census,\r\nabout 18,000 with their friends or boarded out, or 18,900 at the present\r\ntime, in consequence of the increase of population. We have, however,\r\nbut scant faith in the correctness of these relative amounts. All we\r\nreally know is the number receiving definite teaching or training, and\r\nan approximation--nothing more--to the gross number of idiots and\r\nimbeciles in the land. The next point is to determine the number who\r\nbelong to the class, already indicated, which we have to legislate and\r\nprovide for--the poor and the class immediately above them. The wealthy\r\ncan send their children to private institutions; those who belong to an\r\nintermediate class to voluntary establishments, which would, in the\r\nevent of the proposed legislation being carried into effect, be\r\nsufficient. It appears that about two-thirds of the idiots and imbeciles\r\nwere chargeable to the poor rates, according to the census. Two-thirds\r\nof 38,655 yield 25,776. It is estimated that one-fifth of the remainder,\r\nthat is to say 2176, may be added to comprise the class just above\r\npaupers and needing public help in the way proposed. Adding these\r\nfigures together, we get in round numbers 28,000, for whom it is\r\ndesirable for the State more or less to provide, in the way of training\r\nschools and custodial establishments. Those who are now in workhouses\r\nand in lunatic asylums would be removed from them, and so far would\r\nrelieve the latter from their present crowded condition. This object\r\nwould be still further gained if harmless lunatics, as proposed by the\r\nCharity Organization Committee, should be legislated for in the same way\r\nas idiots and imbeciles, and removed from asylums to separate\r\ninstitutions, as has been done at Caterham and Leavesden. The number of\r\nthis class needing public administration is calculated at 7615.\r\n\r\nConfining still our attention to England and Wales, where, as we have\r\nseen, voluntary effort has only succeeded in providing training schools\r\nfor about three per cent. of the idiot and imbecile class, we desire to\r\ndraw attention to the action taken by the Charity Organization Society\r\nof London, arising out of a consciousness of the inadequacy of this\r\nprovision. In the summer of 1877 a sub-committee of this Society entered\r\nvery fully into the consideration of this subject in all its bearings,\r\nand continued week by week, for some months, to discuss the various\r\nquestions which presented themselves. Sir Charles Trevelyan, who\r\noriginated the inquiry, observed that \"he had rarely, if ever, known a\r\nsubject so completely threshed out.\"\r\n\r\nThe most important conclusions arrived at were--that a small proportion\r\nof idiots and imbeciles can be so far improved as to support themselves,\r\nthat a larger proportion may be trained to do some useful work, and that\r\nthe remainder can be rendered happier and not so burdensome to others.\r\nOn inquiry, it was found that about two per cent. of the cases admitted\r\nat Earlswood were cured so as to be able to support themselves. At one\r\nperiod in the history of this institution, when certain very\r\nunfavourable classes were rejected, as many as ten per cent. were so\r\ntrained and improved. That this should be the maximum proportion will\r\nsurprise those who have been misled by the _ad captandum_ statements\r\nsometimes put forward to the public, no doubt with laudable and\r\nbenevolent motives. This amount of success, disheartening as it seems at\r\nfirst, is not to be despised; but the strength of an appeal, whether to\r\nthe charitable public or to the State, to provide for the training of\r\nidiots, lies in elevating them to the highest level of which their\r\norganization admits, curing them of offensive habits, affording them\r\nsome positive happiness, and shielding them from unkind and irritating\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIt is the judgment of the above-mentioned Committee that idiots ought to\r\nbe treated distinctively from other classes, whether the blind, or\r\nlunatics in asylums and workhouses, or children in schools, and that\r\nthey should not be boarded out.\r\n\r\nFor those idiots and imbeciles who have been trained up to a certain\r\npoint, beyond which it is impossible to advance them, suitable\r\ninstitutions or departments of institutions--adult custodial\r\nasylums--are suggested. Those idiots who are young, and can be taught,\r\nshould be kept, as a general rule, distinct from adult idiots, in\r\ntraining schools. These two classes of institutions should be united, if\r\npossible, under the same superintendence.\r\n\r\nThe action to which we have already referred as having been taken by the\r\nMetropolitan Asylum Board, arising out of the Act of 1870, forms a\r\nuseful experiment for the consideration and possible guidance of those\r\nengaged in endeavouring to provide for the training and custody of\r\nidiots and imbeciles, not in the metropolis alone, but the country.\r\n\r\nAfter full discussion, the Charity Organization Committee resolved \"that\r\nthe arrangement which has been made for idiots, imbeciles, and harmless\r\nlunatics in the Metropolitan Asylum District is applicable in its main\r\nprinciples to the rest of England, viz. that they should be removed from\r\nworkhouses and county lunatic asylums, and that young persons of those\r\nclasses should be suitably educated and trained.\" Seeing that experience\r\nclearly proves that the voluntary principle is a failure, or at least\r\nwholly inadequate, for it only touches the fringe of the difficulty, it\r\nbecomes absolutely necessary that the State should step in and\r\nsupplement charitable effort. The Acts at present in force are possibly\r\nsufficiently elastic to provide for the want, if there was a\r\ndetermination on the part of the authorities in the various counties to\r\navail themselves of them; but it is quite certain that no steps will be\r\ntaken to do so, unless a new Act makes a distinct and special provision\r\nfor the education and training of the idiot classes.\r\n\r\nIt appeared just to the Committee that not only should the local rates\r\nprovide, as they do at the present time, for the charge of this class,\r\nbut that assistance should be granted out of the public revenue; the\r\nbest mode for such assistance being in the form of advances for the\r\nbuildings required on easy terms, liberal capitation grants for young\r\npeople under training, and grants of less amount for adults.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that an idiot, while under the process of education, is at\r\nleast as much entitled to the capitation grant allowed by the Education\r\nDepartment as the school children of the non-idiotic class.\r\n\r\nA certain sum would also be received from the families of some of the\r\ninmates of the training schools and custodial institutions. It is\r\nproposed that those families which, although able to pay their way under\r\nordinary circumstances, could not possibly defray the entire cost,\r\nshould pay according to their means. As in the case of the blind and the\r\ndeaf and dumb, it is considered that the relief given to children should\r\nnot be counted as parochial relief to their parents.\r\n\r\nThe question arose in the Committee whether those who are able to pay\r\nfor the whole of their maintenance should be admitted, but no definite\r\nopinion was arrived at; there being much to be said on both sides of the\r\nquestion. No doubt such a course might interfere with private\r\ninstitutions, and might in some instances lead to filling up the room of\r\nan asylum which ought to be occupied by the needier classes--a complaint\r\nfrequently made (whether justly or unjustly) against the lunatic\r\nhospitals of America. At the same time, the principle of making the\r\npayments of the higher supplement those of the lower classes is a sound\r\none, and has been found to answer in such institutions as the York\r\nRetreat. But those who have had most experience of the friends of idiots\r\nknow that they are much less willing to pay handsomely for their\r\ntraining or care than they would be for an insane member of the family.\r\nThe occurrence of insanity in a family, especially if manifesting itself\r\nin the form of outrageous violence or of suicide, alarms the relatives,\r\nand forces them to place the patient in an asylum at almost any cost. In\r\nthe case of idiotic or imbecile children, they are easily secluded, or\r\nplaced with some one willing to take charge of them, without\r\nnecessitating the restraint of an asylum.\r\n\r\nIdiot establishments, supported by the weekly payments of the rich, are\r\nnot therefore proposed; and although there may be cases in which the\r\ncost of training and maintenance may be properly paid, this course would\r\nnot be allowed to wealthy persons, who are really able to pay higher\r\nterms in a private asylum.\r\n\r\nWith regard to a very important aspect of the subject--the governing\r\nbodies of these asylums for idiots--it is not proposed that they should\r\nbe the same as in the case of county asylums, but that they should\r\nconsist of representatives of the local magistrates, representatives of\r\nthe local guardians, and, thirdly, of persons appointed by the Crown.\r\nFollowing the example of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, it is proposed\r\nto erect large institutions capable of accommodating not more than two\r\nthousand adults, and schools containing not more than five hundred\r\nchildren, that is to say, idiots and imbeciles up to twenty years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nIn this large number of adults, however, is included the proposed\r\nprovision for harmless lunatics, for whom it is desired to legislate at\r\nthe same time. With these we are not concerned in the present chapter.\r\nIt may be remembered, however, that by adopting the \"block\" system of\r\nconstruction of asylums, harmless lunatics can be placed with facility\r\nin one department, and adult idiots in another.\r\n\r\nIt is very desirable that these new institutions should be inspected,\r\nlike other asylums, by the Commissioners in Lunacy; they should be\r\ninspected and reported upon to the Local Government Board.\r\n\r\nAmong the advantages likely to result from the adoption of the scheme\r\nthus briefly sketched out, may be mentioned that those institutions\r\nwhich, like Earlswood, have been founded by benevolent individuals for\r\nthe middle class and the stratum beneath it, will have much more room\r\nfor the class intended, and that the troublesome and expensive canvass,\r\nnow become such an intolerable nuisance, will in all probability be\r\ndone away with.\r\n\r\nThe Act 16 and 17 Vict., c. 97, defines \"lunatic\" to include \"every\r\nperson being an idiot,\" and the second section obliges justices to\r\nprovide accommodation for pauper lunatics. Section 30 of the same Act\r\nempowers justices to build additional asylums where necessary, and\r\nshould they fail to do so, the Home Secretary, on the recommendation of\r\nthe Commissioners, may enforce it. Further, the Act 25 and 26 Vict., c.\r\n43, empowers boards of guardians to send pauper children to schools\r\ncertified by the Local Government Board, and the word \"school\" is\r\ndefined by section 10 to extend to any institution for the instruction\r\nof idiots. Lastly, the Act 31 and 32 Vict., c. 122, permits guardians,\r\nwith the consent of the Local Government Board, to send an idiotic\r\npauper to an asylum or establishment for the reception and relief of\r\nidiots maintained at the charge of the county rate or by public\r\nsubscription.\r\n\r\nThese enactments, however, do not oblige the justices to provide\r\ntraining schools for idiots, or to make distinct provision for them and\r\nlunatics. They are, no doubt, permitted to do so, but the expense\r\ninvolved would be so great that it can hardly be expected such a course\r\nwill be pursued, unless assisted by grants from the imperial exchequer.\r\nThe permission to send idiots to idiot schools supported by the rates or\r\nby charity, amounts practically to nothing, because they are so few in\r\nnumber, and are crowded already.\r\n\r\nLegislation, therefore, is required to substitute \"shall\" for \"may,\"\r\nand to lessen the burden which would fall upon the rates, if the right\r\ncourse for the good of the idiots and imbeciles is to be thoroughly\r\ncarried out in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nWe cannot close this chapter without remarking on the satisfactory\r\nchange of sentiment which has taken place in regard to this deplorable\r\nclass. There may be times when, desiring to see \"the survival of the\r\nfittest,\" we may be tempted to wish that idiots and imbeciles were\r\nstamped out of society. But, as Mr. Darwin has somewhere said, there is\r\na compensation for the continued existence of so pitiable a population\r\nin our midst, in the circumstance that our sympathies are called forth\r\non their behalf; a commentary on the precept that those who are strong\r\nshould help the weak. The change in feeling above mentioned cannot be\r\nmore strongly illustrated than by imagining for a moment that, at the\r\npresent day, any leading divine should give utterance to the following\r\nsentiments uttered by the great German Reformer. \"Idiots,\" says he, \"are\r\nmen in whom devils have established themselves, and all the physicians\r\nwho heal these infirmities as though they proceeded from natural causes\r\nare ignorant blockheads, who know nothing about the power of the demon.\r\nEight years ago, I myself saw a child of this kind which had no human\r\nparents, but had proceeded from the devil. He was twelve years of age,\r\nand in outward form exactly resembled ordinary children.... But if any\r\none touched him, he yelled out like a mad creature, and with a peculiar\r\nsort of scream. I said to the princes of Anhalt, with whom I was at the\r\ntime, '_If I had the ordering of things here, I would have that child\r\nthrown into the Moldau, at the risk of being held its murderer._' But\r\nthe Elector of Saxony and the princes were not of my opinion in the\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDUM.\r\n\r\nMr. Millard has prepared the following tabular statement, which shows at\r\na glance the information a reader is likely to require in recommending\r\nasylums for this unfortunate class.\r\n\r\n                    ASYLUMS FOR IDIOTS AND IMBECILES.\r\n\r\n  ------------+---------------+---------------+-------------------------\r\n    Name and  |      Cases    |      How      |     Conditions,\r\n     place.   |    admitted.  |   admitted.   |    remarks, etc.\r\n  ------------+---------------+---------------+-------------------------\r\n  METROPOLITAN|               |               |\r\n  PAUPER      |               |               |\r\n  ASYLUMS:    |               |               |\r\n  Leavesden, }|Adult idiots,  |Through the   }|\r\n  Herts.     }|imbeciles and  |boards of     }|Residence in Middlesex.\r\n  Caterham,  }|harmless       |guardians.    }|\r\n  Surrey.    }|lunatics.      |              }|\r\n              |               |               |\r\n  Darenth,    |Youthful idiots|  Ditto.       |  Ditto.\r\n  Dartford,   |and imbeciles. |               |\r\n  Kent.       |               |               |\r\n\r\n            VOLUNTARY INSTITUTIONS FOR IDIOTS AND IMBECILES.\r\n\r\n  ASYLUM FOR  |Idiots and     |By votes of    |Election cases must be\r\n  IDIOTS,     |imbeciles above|subscribers at |under 16 years of age and\r\n  Earlswood,  |the pauper     |half-yearly    |unable to pay 50 guineas\r\n  Redhill,    |class.         |elections.     |per annum.

Ireland and Beach.\r\n\r\n[225] It is due to the late Dr. Poole, of Montrose, to state that so\r\nearly as 1819 he drew attention to the education of idiots in an article\r\nin the _Edinburgh Encyclopaedia_.\r\n\r\n[226] Dr. Ireland has now removed from Larbert to Preston Lodge,\r\nPrestonpans, near Edinburgh, and receives imbeciles into his house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSCOTLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur reference in a previous chapter to the singular superstitions\r\nconnected with the treatment of the insane in Scotland, renders it\r\nunnecessary to do more than point out in this place the substratum of\r\npopular opinion and feeling, upon which the infusion of new ideas and a\r\nscientific system of treatment had to work. To some extent it was the\r\nsame in other countries, but judging from the records of the past, as\r\ngiven or brought to light by writers like Heron, Dalyell, and Dr.\r\nMitchell, no country ever exceeded Scotland in the grossness of its\r\nsuperstition and the unhappy consequences which flowed from it. When we\r\ninclude in this the horrible treatment of the insane, from the prevalent\r\nand for long inveterate belief in witchcraft, we cannot find language\r\nsufficiently strong to characterize the conduct of the people, from the\r\nhighest to the lowest in the land, until this monstrous belief was\r\nexpelled by the spread of knowledge, the influence of which on conduct\r\nand on law some do not sufficiently realize.\r\n\r\nThe lunatic and the witch of to-day might aptly exclaim--\r\n\r\n    \"The good of ancient times let others state;\r\n     I think it lucky I was born so late.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the property of the insane, the Scotch law, from a remote\r\nperiod, appears to have been that the ward and custody of it belonged to\r\nthe prince as _pater patriae_. In the beginning of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, the keeping and custody of persons of \"furious mind,\" by a\r\nstatute of Robert I., devolved upon their relatives, and, failing them,\r\non the justiciar or sheriff of the county. The custody of \"fatuous\r\npersons\" is said to have been committed to the next agnate (nearest male\r\nrelative on the father's side), while that of the \"furious\" was\r\nentrusted to the Crown, \"as having the sole power of coercing with\r\nfetters.\"[227]\r\n\r\nAn Act passed in 1585, c. 18, in consequence of abuses in regard to the\r\nnominations of tutors-at-law, provided that the nearest agnate of the\r\nlunatic should be preferred to the office of tutor-at-law. The practice\r\nwas originally to issue one brieve, applicable to both furiosity and\r\nfatuity. The statute just mentioned continues the _regula regulans_, as\r\nto the appointment of tutors-at-law for lunatics.\r\n\r\nPassing over two centuries, I must observe that in 1792 Dr. Duncan (the\r\nphysician mentioned at p. 122 of this work), then President of the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians of Edinburgh, laid before that body a plan for\r\nestablishing a lunatic asylum in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. That\r\nplan, after due consideration, met with the unanimous approval of the\r\nColleges of Physicians and Surgeons, and a subscription was at once set\r\non foot to carry it into execution, nearly every Fellow of both Colleges\r\ncontributing something. But enough money was not then raised to start\r\nthe project in a practical way. Fourteen years afterwards, the attention\r\nof the legislature was directed to the provision for the insane in\r\nScotland, when (in 1806) an Act (46 Geo. III., c. 156) was passed for\r\nappropriating certain balances arising from forfeited estates in that\r\ncountry to two objects, not apparently allied--the use of the British\r\nfisheries and the erecting a lunatic asylum in Edinburgh--ichthyology\r\nand psychology. The Act provided, among other clauses, that the Barons\r\nof Exchequer should pay out of the unexhausted balance or surplus of the\r\nmoneys paid to them in 1784, by the Act 24 Geo. III., c. 57 (relating to\r\nforfeited estates placed under the board or trustees), the sum of L2000\r\nto the city of Edinburgh towards erecting a lunatic hospital. A royal\r\ncharter was obtained in 1807, and subscriptions were raised not only\r\nfrom Scotland, but England, and even India, Ceylon, and the West Indies.\r\nMadras alone subscribed L1000. The idea of the originators of the\r\ninstitution was a charitable and very far-reaching one. They made\r\nprovision for three classes--paupers, intermediate, and a third in which\r\nthe patient had a servant to attend him. It may be mentioned that the\r\nestablishment of the Retreat of York and its success were constantly\r\nreferred to in appealing to the public for subscriptions. The building\r\nwhich is now the \"East House\" was opened in 1813, and the plan of that\r\nbuilding was greatly superior to the prison-like arrangement of some of\r\nthe asylums built twenty or thirty years afterwards. From the beginning\r\nthe teaching of mental disease to students was considered, as well as\r\nthe cure and care of the inmates. The management was a wise one. There\r\nwere three governing bodies--the \"ordinary managers,\" for transacting\r\nthe ordinary business; the \"medical board\" of five, consisting of the\r\nPresident and three Fellows of the Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons;\r\nand the \"extraordinary managers,\" consisting of official and\r\nrepresentative men in and about Edinburgh, who had, along with the\r\nordinary managers, the election of the board every year. At first there\r\nwas a lay superintendent and visiting physicians.\r\n\r\nThen there was an Act \"regulating mad-houses in Scotland\" (55 Geo. III.,\r\nc. 69), passed in the year 1815--that important epoch in lunacy\r\nlegislation in the British Isles--brought in by the Lord Advocate of\r\nScotland (Mr. Colquhoun), Mr. W. Dundas, and General Wemyss, and which\r\nreceived the royal assent, after several amendments from the House of\r\nLords, June 7, 1815.\r\n\r\nThis Act provided that sheriffs should grant licences for keeping\r\nasylums; that no person should keep one without a licence; that the\r\nmoney received for licences should form part of the rogue money in the\r\ncounty or stewartry, and that out of it all the expenses required for\r\nthe execution of the Act should be defrayed; that inspectors should be\r\nelected within a month after the passing of the Act, and thereafter\r\nshould annually inspect asylums twice a year--four by the Royal College\r\nof Physicians in Edinburgh from their ordinary resident members, and\r\nfour by the faculty of physicians and surgeons in Glasgow from their\r\nordinary resident members; that sheriffs should ascertain whether\r\npatients are properly confined; that the sheriff should make an order\r\nfor the reception of lunatics, upon a report or certificate signed by a\r\nmedical man (no statutory form was ordered for the medical certificates\r\nor the warrants of the sheriffs; a medical man signing a certificate\r\nwithout due examination of the patient was to forfeit L50); that the\r\nsheriff or stewart might set persons improperly detained at liberty;\r\nthat a licence might be recalled upon report made to the sheriff by two\r\nof the inspectors; that the sheriff might make rules for the proper\r\nmanagement of asylums; that the Act should not extend to public\r\nhospitals, nor to single patients; that the Procurator Fiscal should\r\nenforce the Act and recover penalties. The friends of patients were\r\nrequired to pay an annual fee L2 2s.\r\n\r\nSuch were the main provisions of this Act, which proved to be an\r\nimportant advance in the right direction, though far from perfect. It\r\nwas amended by 9 Geo. IV., c. 34, and 4 and 5 Vict., c. 60. The three\r\nActs were repealed and other provisions made by the 20 and 21 Vict., c.\r\n71, an \"Act for the Regulation, Care, and Treatment of Lunatics, and for\r\nthe Provision, Regulation, and Maintenance of Asylums.\"\r\n\r\nI may add here, though anticipating the future course of events, that\r\nthe General Board of Commissioners in Scotland was established by the\r\nActs 20 and 21 Vict., c. 71, and 21 and 22 Vict., c. 54, both Acts\r\nbeing amended by 25 and 26 Vict., c. 54, and 27 and 28 Vict., c. 59, the\r\nlatter continuing the appointment of Deputy Commissioners, and making\r\nprovisions for salaries, etc. The statutes now in force in Scotland are\r\nthe 20 and 21 Vict., c. 71; 21 and 22 Vict., c. 89; 25 and 26 Vict., c.\r\n54; 27 and 28 Vict., c. 59; Act for the protection of property of\r\npersons under mental incapacity, 12 and 13 Vict., c. 51; Act providing\r\nfor the custody of dangerous lunatics in Scotland, 4 and 5 Vict., c. 60\r\n(repealed and other provisions made by fore-mentioned Acts); Act to\r\namend the law relating to lunacy in Scotland and to make further\r\nprovision for the care and treatment of lunatics, 29 and 30 Vict., c.\r\n51; Act to amend the law relating to criminal and dangerous lunatics in\r\nScotland, 34 and 35 Vict., c. 55 (1871).\r\n\r\nBut we must retrace our steps to pursue the course of legislation a\r\nlittle more in detail.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of February, 1818, a Bill for the erecting of district\r\nlunatic asylums in Scotland for the care and confinement of lunatics,\r\nbrought in by Lord Binning and Mr. Brogden, was read the first time. A\r\nfew days after, a petition of the noblemen, gentlemen, freeholders,\r\njustices for the peace, Commissioners of Supply, and other heritors of\r\nthe county of Ayr was presented against it, setting forth that the\r\npetitioners, \"from the first moment that they were made acquainted with\r\nthe principle and provisions of the proposed Bill, were deeply alarmed\r\nfor their own interests and those of Scotland in general, by the\r\nintroduction of a measure uncalled for and inexpedient, novel in its\r\napplication and arrangement, and substituting regulations of compulsion,\r\nto the exclusion of the more salutary exertions of spontaneous charity,\r\nand this, too, at a time when, by the gradual progress of enlightened\r\nphilanthropy, so many admirable institutions have been so lately\r\nestablished in various parts of Scotland by voluntary contributions; and\r\nthat the petitioners are most willing to pay every just tribute of\r\nrespect to the humane views which may have dictated the proposed\r\nmeasure, but they are satisfied that it must have owed its origin to\r\nexaggerated and false representations of the state of the lunatics in\r\nScotland, and an unjust and groundless assumption of a want of humanity\r\nin the people of Scotland toward objects afflicted with so severe a\r\ncalamity. The House cannot fail to remark that the proposed Bill\r\nrecognizes a systematic assessment, which it has been the wise policy of\r\nour forefathers to avoid in practice, and that, too, to an amount at the\r\ndiscretion of Commissioners ignorant of local circumstances, and perhaps\r\nthe dupes of misinformation; entertaining, as the petitioners do, deep\r\nand well-grounded repugnance to the means proposed for carrying this\r\nmeasure into execution, partly injudicious and partly degrading to the\r\nlandholders of Scotland, for it does appear to be a humiliating and, the\r\npetitioners may venture to say, an unconstitutional Act, which would\r\nplace the whole landholders in Scotland in the situation of being taxed\r\nfor any object and to any amount at the discretion of any set of\r\nCommissioners whatever; the petitioners therefore, confiding in the\r\nwisdom of the House, humbly pray that the proposed Bill for providing\r\nplaces for the confinement of lunatics in Scotland may not pass into\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\nAnother petition against the Bill, from the magistrates and council of\r\nthe royal burgh of Ayr, was presented and read, praying that the same\r\nmay not pass into a law; or that if the House should think proper to\r\npass the said Bill, they would exempt the burgh and parish of Ayr from\r\nits enactments.\r\n\r\nLater on, another petition of the magistrates and town council of the\r\nroyal burgh of Montrose was presented against the Bill; and subsequently\r\none from Stirlingshire, Renfrew, Wigton, Edinburgh, Elgin, Glasgow,\r\nPerth, Dumfries, and many other places.\r\n\r\nThe second reading was again and again deferred until the 1st of June,\r\nwhen it was ordered \"that the Bill be read a second time upon this day\r\nthree months.\" Thus persistent obstruction triumphed.\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Halliday, who took from an early period a lively interest in\r\nthe insane, writes in 1827: \"I cannot but regret that the public refused\r\nthe adoption of a law for erecting district or county establishments,\r\nproposed some years ago by that excellent nobleman, Lord Binning. The\r\nrejection of this Act arose, I believe, neither from the parsimony nor\r\nthe poverty of the freeholders, but from a dread of introducing into the\r\nkingdom that system which has been denominated the nightmare of England,\r\nthe poor's rates.\"[228]\r\n\r\nHow much legislation was needed at this period is well shown by the\r\ndescription, by a philanthropist, of the condition of the lunatics in\r\nthe Perth Tolbooth, for which I am indebted to the late lamented Dr.\r\nLauder Lindsay, who observes: \"Here is exactly what Mr. J. J. Gurney\r\nsays, and it is of special interest to us, as showing the sort of\r\nprovision made for the comfort of our local insane prior to the\r\nestablishment of the Murray Royal Institution in 1877, nine years\r\nafterwards. In all probability Mr. Gurney's report, which was published\r\nin his 'Notes on a Visit made to some of the Prisons of Scotland,' led\r\ndirectly or indirectly to Mr. Murray's fortune being devoted to the\r\ninstitution of an Hospital for the Insane. 'The old Jail of Perth is\r\nbuilt over a gateway in the middle of the town. Although this dark and\r\nwretched building had been for some time disused as a prison, it was not\r\nat the period of our visit' (Mr. Gurney's sister, Mrs. Fry, accompanied\r\nhim) 'without its unhappy inhabitants. We found in it two lunatics in a\r\nmost melancholy condition; both of them in solitary confinement, their\r\napartments dirty and gloomy; and a small dark closet, connected with\r\neach of the rooms, filled up with a bed of straw. In these closets,\r\nwhich are far more like the dens of wild animals than the habitations of\r\nmankind, the poor men were lying with very little clothing upon them.\r\nThey appeared in a state of fatuity, the almost inevitable consequence\r\nof the treatment to which they were exposed. _No one resided in the\r\nhouse_ to superintend these afflicted persons, some man, living in the\r\ntown, having been appointed to feed them at certain hours of the day.\r\nThey were, in fact, treated _exactly as if they had been beasts_. A few\r\ndays after our visit, one of these poor creatures was found dead in his\r\nbed. I suppose it to be in consequence of this event that the other,\r\nthough not recovered from his malady, again walks the streets of Perth\r\nwithout control. It is much to be regretted that no medium can be found\r\nbetween so cruel an incarceration and total want of care.'\"\r\n\r\nA return, signed \"H. Hobhouse,\" was made in this year (1818) from the\r\nparochial clergy in Scotland, showing the number of lunatics in each\r\ncounty, and other particulars, which now possesses considerable interest\r\nhistorically. The most important figures are as follows:--\r\n\r\nTABLE\r\n\r\nSHOWING THE NUMBER OF INSANE, ETC., IN THE SCOTCH SHIRES IN 1818 AND THE\r\nNUMBER IN ASYLUMS.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------+----------------------------------\r\n                            |\r\n                            |   Number of insane and idiots.\r\n            Shire.          +-------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                            | Male. |Female. | Total. |   In\r\n                            |       |        |        |asylums.\r\n  --------------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Aberdeen                  |  197  |   226  |    423 |    41\r\n  Argyle                    |  171  |   122  |    293 |     9\r\n  Ayr                       |  110  |   104  |    214 |    14\r\n  Banff                     |   62  |    86  |    148 |     6\r\n  Berwick                   |   38  |    28  |     66 |     3\r\n  Bute                      |   32  |    27  |     59 |     1\r\n  Caithness                 |   45  |    29  |     74 |     0\r\n  Clackmannan and Cromarty  |   20  |    19  |     39 |     1\r\n  Dumbarton                 |   44  |    38  |     82 |     6\r\n  Dumfries                  |   84  |    79  |    163 |    15\r\n  Edinburgh                 |  132  |   153  |    285 |   148\r\n  Elgin                     |   32  |    47  |     79 |     4\r\n  Fife                      |  115  |   127  |    242 |    11\r\n  Forfar                    |  122  |   154  |    276 |    37\r\n  Haddington                |   44  |    36  |     80 |     9\r\n  Inverness                 |  130  |   110  |    240 |    10\r\n  Kincardine                |   52  |    58  |    110 |     5\r\n  Kinross                   |    6  |     9  |     15 |     1\r\n  Kirkcudbright             |   42  |    35  |     77 |     5\r\n  Lanark                    |  156  |   193  |    349 |    28\r\n  Linlithgow                |   25  |    35  |     60 |     1\r\n  Nairn                     |    4  |    20  |     24 |     0\r\n  Orkney and Shetland       |   67  |    62  |    129 |     0\r\n  Peebles                   |   12  |    16  |     28 |     0\r\n  Perth                     |  179  |   134  |    313 |    17\r\n  Renfrew                   |   94  |    81  |    175 |    24\r\n  Ross                      |  107  |   103  |    210 |     4\r\n  Roxburgh                  |   52  |    56  |    108 |    10\r\n  Selkirk                   |    6  |     6  |     12 |     0\r\n  Sterling                  |   58  |    64  |    122 |     4\r\n  Sutherland                |   36  |    27  |     63 |     1\r\n  Wigton                    |   30  |    40  |     70 |     4\r\n                            +-------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                            | 2304  |  2324  |   4628 |   417\r\n  --------------------------+-------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nFrom this table it will be seen that the total number was 4628, of whom\r\n2304 were males and 2324 females. With regard to their distribution,\r\nthere were--\r\n\r\n  In public asylums       258\r\n  In private asylums      158\r\n  With friends           1357\r\n  At large               2855\r\n                         ----\r\n                  Total  4628\r\n\r\nTwo thousand one hundred and forty-nine were maintained wholly or in\r\npart by the parish. Fifty parishes failed to send any return. In one\r\nparish in the city of Edinburgh, from which we have no return, were\r\nsituated the \"Edinburgh Bedlam\" and the Charity Workhouse. In these two\r\nplaces were confined eighty-eight lunatics and idiots. From Glasgow the\r\nreturns did not include ninety-five lunatics and idiots confined in the\r\nGlasgow Asylum and Towns Hospital; 187 patients must therefore be added\r\nto the foregoing, making a total of 4815.\r\n\r\nConsidering the period at which it was made, this is a very remarkable\r\nreturn, and was much more complete than some later ones; for instance,\r\nin 1826 the Parliamentary returns were ridiculously below these figures,\r\nand Sir Andrew Halliday could only after diligent inquiry bring up the\r\nnumber to 3700.[229]\r\n\r\nTwo years later (1828), a Bill was brought into the House of Commons to\r\namend the Act 55 Geo. III., c. 69,[230] by the Lord Advocate, Mr. H.\r\nDrummond, and Mr. Robert Gordon. It passed the House of Lords, and\r\nreceived the royal assent June 27th.\r\n\r\nThis constituted the Act 9 Geo. IV., c. 34, and reduced the fees paid\r\nfor persons confined from L2 2s. to 10s. 6d.; admission and discharge\r\nbooks were ordered to be kept in every asylum, and an entry made of\r\nevery act of coercion; the books of the asylum were to be submitted to\r\nthe inspectors; no insane person was to be received into a hospital\r\nwithout a warrant from the sheriff, who was to inspect hospitals; houses\r\nwere to be visited by medical men--those containing less than one\r\nhundred patients, in case such house should not be kept by a physician\r\nor surgeon, were to be visited twice in every week by a physician or\r\nsurgeon--signing in a register the condition of the house and state of\r\nhealth of the patients; a register was also to be kept by the resident\r\nphysician or surgeon, and such register was to be regularly laid before\r\nthe inspectors, who were required to sign the same in testimony of its\r\nproduction; ministers were empowered to visit mad-houses in their\r\nparishes; regulations were made as to persons with whom lunatics were\r\nprivately confined; the justices might appoint three of their number to\r\ninspect hospitals and private mad-houses; lastly, a weekly register was\r\nto be kept in each house, and to be laid before the inspectors, stating\r\nthe number of curable and incurable cases, and the number under\r\nrestraint, the necessity thereof being certified by a medical man.\r\n\r\nI wish to record here that, so far back as 1838, some of the Scotch\r\nasylums were remarkable for the extent to which labour was introduced.\r\nBeing engaged in writing an introduction to Jacobi's work \"On the\r\nConstruction of Asylums,\" the editor (Mr. S. Tuke) visited the asylums\r\nof Scotland in that year, accompanied by Mr. Williams, the visiting\r\nmedical officer of the York Retreat, and found at Perth, Dundee, and\r\nAberdeen, the men's wards nearly empty, so large a proportion of their\r\ninmates were in one way or other engaged in labour. \"At Perth,\" he\r\nwrites, \"more than twenty came in together to dinner from the labours of\r\nthe farm; others were employed in the garden and about the premises. At\r\nDundee at nine o'clock in the morning, out of fifty-seven men patients\r\nof the lower class, twelve were engaged in stone-breaking, eight in\r\ngardening, thirteen in weaving, one in tailoring, two as shoemakers,\r\nwhilst a few were engaged in the preparation of tow for spinning, and\r\nseveral in the various services of the house. In the Aberdeen Asylum, in\r\nwhich the labour system is extensively introduced, we were particularly\r\npleased with the state of the lowest class of women patients--chiefly in\r\nan idiotic and demented state. All of these but one, and she was in a\r\nstate of temporary active mania, were employed in picking wool or some\r\nother simple occupation. Indeed, in the three asylums which I have just\r\nmentioned, the state of the lowest class of patients offers a striking\r\ncontrast to that in which they have been usually found in our asylums.\r\nThose dismal-looking objects, cringing in the corners of the rooms or\r\nsquatting on the ground, almost lost to the human form, are here not to\r\nbe seen. I must not omit to mention that at Aberdeen the manager had\r\nsucceeded in inducing the higher class of patients to engage in\r\ngardening, etc. At Glasgow the governors were contemplating arrangements\r\nfor the more extensive introduction of the labour system. In all these\r\nasylums the superintendents expressed their decided conviction of the\r\nbenefit which, in a great variety of ways, was derived from the\r\nemployment of the patients, more especially in outdoor labour.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Dundee and Glasgow asylums, the great services\r\nrendered by Dr. McIntosh ought not to be forgotten, as also those of Dr.\r\nPoole (Montrose), Dr. Malcolm (Perth), and Dr. Hutcheson (Gartnavel).\r\n\r\nScotland south of Edinburgh and Glasgow had not, until 1839, any\r\nretreat or place of confinement for the insane, except six squalid stone\r\ncells attached to the public hospital of Dumfries. Violent or vagrant\r\nlunatics were physically restrained in their own houses, allowed to roam\r\nat large, or incarcerated in prisons or police stations. In the year\r\nmentioned, the Crichton Institution was opened for the reception of\r\npatients of all ranks and means, from the pauper to the peer, in other\r\nwords, at rates of board from L17 to L350. In those days the building\r\nwas regarded as magnificent, commodious, and much in advance of the\r\nprevalent psychiatry in Scotland, in the provision for the restoration\r\nof mental and physical health, and for securing the comfort and\r\nhappiness of the inmates. The funds providing this building and\r\nsurrounding fields, had been bequeathed by Dr. Crichton, of Friars\r\nCarse, Dumfriesshire, to his widow, who determined the precise\r\napplication of the magnificent legacy, which it is reported amounted to\r\nL120,000. The benevolent foundress caused the structure to have the\r\nBible as a foundation, instead of a stone, and announced her solemn\r\nintention that the establishment should be conducted, not merely in\r\naccordance with science, but the principles of Christian philanthropy.\r\nThe first medical superintendent, Dr. W. A. F. Browne, who had made a\r\ncritical examination of European asylums, and had acted as the chief\r\nofficer in the Montrose Lunatic Asylum during four years, opened the\r\nCrichton Institution in 1839, with what were regarded as sound but\r\nadvanced views, and with the resolution of carrying into effect all\r\nthat had been discovered or suggested for the amelioration, cure, and\r\ncare of those who might require treatment or seclusion.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the first year of his management, there would appear\r\nto have been about a hundred individuals, of various stations and in\r\nvarious mental conditions, consigned to his charge. For these and the\r\ngradually increasing numbers of the population, he instituted daily\r\nexercise, amusement, occupation in the open air and in the grounds of\r\nthe establishment, and during winter or inclement weather, billiards,\r\nbagatelle, \"summer ice,\" and walking in the protected balconies\r\nconnected with every ward or gallery in the house. Collections of books\r\nwere contemporary with the laboratory, and the medical officers\r\ninvariably carried a catalogue, along with a prescription book, in their\r\ndaily medical visits to every patient. As a rule, remuneration was\r\nordained for every description of labour, whether it was mental or\r\nmanual, and might take a pecuniary or honorary form. From the\r\ncommencement no personal restraint was resorted to, although the medical\r\ndirector did not bind himself either by rules or avowed opinions to\r\nprohibit mechanical resources, should they appear to be demanded for the\r\npreservation of life or strength, or quiet, or in any respect as a\r\nremedial agent. In 1840 a medical assistant or pupil was appointed. The\r\nexperiment proved eminently successful, and the course thus foreshadowed\r\nhas been universally adopted, and improved upon by increase in the\r\nnumber of such fellow labourers, by the addition of clinical clerks, and\r\nso forth. The next advance was in instituting recorded observations of\r\nthe state of patients during the night as well as the day; in the\r\naddition of carriages as a means of enjoyment and distraction, one of\r\nthese being an omnibus, so that groups of the inmates might be conveyed\r\nto distant parts of the surrounding country; and in the multiplication\r\nof hygienic and moral influences, music, painting, translation, study of\r\nmedicine, acquisition of languages, teaching, reading prayers, etc. The\r\nnext stage of development may be described as the separation of\r\ndifferent classes of patients; provision for the agitated, for\r\nabstainers; mental culture for all capable of receiving impressions,\r\nlectures, public readings, the production of a monthly periodical which\r\nis still continued. Of this institution we shall have to speak again.\r\n\r\nAn Act to alter and amend certain Acts regulating mad-houses in\r\nScotland, and to provide for the custody of dangerous lunatics, was\r\npassed in June, 1841 (4 and 5 Vict., c. 60). It amended 55 Geo. III., c.\r\n69, and 9 Geo. IV., c. 34. A penalty of L200 and the expenses of\r\nrecovering the same might be imposed on persons sending any lunatic to a\r\nmad-house without a licence; persons convicted of receiving lunatics\r\nwithout a licence, or the required order, might be imprisoned in default\r\nof penalty; the sheriff on application of the Procurator Fiscal might\r\ncommit dangerous lunatics; the expenses were to be defrayed out of the\r\nrogue money, if the person had not the means of defraying, or if it\r\ncould not be recovered out of his estate, then the same was to be\r\ndefrayed by the parish which would be liable for the maintenance of\r\nsuch lunatic if he or she were a pauper; lunatics might be removed on\r\napplication by the Procurator Fiscal; parish pauper lunatics were to be\r\nconfined in public hospitals; if no public hospital in the county, the\r\nsheriff might send lunatics to an adjoining county; the death of a\r\nlunatic was to be intimated to the sheriff in writing by the person\r\nkeeping the licensed mad-house; fees of licences might be diminished if\r\nthe moneys received exceeded the sums required for carrying this Act\r\ninto execution.\r\n\r\nA form of register was to be kept in all licensed mad-houses in\r\nScotland, indicating the house; where situated and kept; names and\r\ndesignations of individuals confined; date of reception; at whose\r\ninstance confined, and on whose medical certificate; whether curable or\r\nincurable; date of removal or discharge, and authority for either; date\r\nof death; disease or cause of death, and duration of disorder; name of\r\nmedical practitioner; when first called to give special attendance, and\r\nhow often he afterwards visited the deceased, with the place of burial.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention that in 1848 further legislation was\r\nattempted--an attempt, the failure of which was frequently deplored in\r\nthe debates of succeeding years. A good Bill designed to amend the law\r\nof Scotland relative to the care and custody of the insane, and to\r\nregulate existing asylums, and to establish asylums for pauper lunatics,\r\nwas brought in by the Lord Advocate (Lord Rutherfurd), Sir George Grey,\r\nand the Secretary at War. After the second reading it was referred to a\r\nSelect Committee, which included the names of the Lord Advocate, Lord\r\nAshley, Sir James Graham, Mr. E. Ellice, Mr. Stuart Wortley, and Mr. H.\r\nDrummond. Petitions now poured in from almost every shire in Scotland,\r\nand the Bill had unfortunately to be withdrawn. Undaunted, the Lord\r\nAdvocate made another attempt in the following year, but with the same\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dwell longer on the condition of the insane, or\r\nthe legislation adopted on their behalf, till we come to the year 1855,\r\nwhich proved to be the commencement of a new departure in the care taken\r\nfor them by the State. Unfortunately, in spite of legal enactments, the\r\nstate of the insane in Scotland, at this time, outside the asylums was\r\nas bad as it could be, and even in some asylums it was deplorable. At\r\nthis period a well-known American lady, Miss Dix, who devoted her life\r\nto the interests of the insane, visited Scotland, and the writer had the\r\nopportunity of hearing from her own lips, on her return from her\r\nphilanthropic expedition, the narration of what she saw of the cruel\r\nneglect of the pauper lunatics in that country. She caused so much\r\nsensation by her visits and her remonstrances, accompanied by the\r\nintimation that she should report what she had witnessed at\r\nhead-quarters in London, that a certain official in Edinburgh decided to\r\nanticipate \"the American Invader,\" as Dr. W. A. F. Browne called her.\r\nMiss Dix was, however, equal to the occasion, and, hurriedly leaving the\r\nscene of her investigations, she took the night mail to London, and\r\nappeared before the Home Secretary on the following day, when the\r\ngentleman from Edinburgh was still on the road, quite unconscious that\r\nthe good lady had already traversed it.[231] The facts she laid before\r\nthe Home Office were so startling that they produced a marked effect,\r\nand, notwithstanding counter allegations, the conclusion was very soon\r\narrived at that there was sufficient _prima facie_ evidence to justify\r\nan inquiry. A Royal Commission was appointed, dated April 3, 1855, \"to\r\ninquire into the condition of lunatic asylums in Scotland, and the\r\nexisting state of the law of that country in reference to lunatics and\r\nlunatic asylums.\"\r\n\r\nThe statutes forming the code of lunacy law for Scotland at that period\r\nwere, for all practical purposes, the 55 Geo. III., c. 69; 9 Geo. IV.,\r\nc. 34; and 4 and 5 Vict., c. 60.\r\n\r\nThe number of ascertained patients at this period (1855) amounted to\r\n7403. The classification was as follows:--Private patients, 2732;\r\npaupers, 4642; criminals, 29 = 7403. Curable, 768; incurable, 4032;\r\ncongenital idiots and imbeciles, 2603 = 7403. Males, 3736; females, 3667\r\n= 7403. The proportion of the insane and idiots to the population was 1\r\nin 390. The number of congenital idiots was greatest in proportion to\r\nthe population in those counties remote from influences that incite to\r\nmental activity--the Highland population containing more than three\r\ntimes the number found in an equal Lowland population.\r\n\r\nThe 2732 private patients were thus distributed: In chartered asylums,\r\n652; licensed houses, 231; poor-houses, 9; reported houses, 10; school\r\nfor idiots, 12; unlicensed houses, 18; with relatives, 1453; with\r\nstrangers, 297; not under any care, 50; total, 2732.\r\n\r\nThe 4642 paupers were thus distributed: In chartered asylums, 1511;\r\nlicensed houses, 426; poor-houses, 667; reported houses, 31; school for\r\nidiots, 3; unlicensed houses, 6; with relatives, 1217; with strangers,\r\n640; not under any care, 141; total, 4642.\r\n\r\nThe receptacles for the insane were thus distributed:--\r\n\r\nA. Chartered asylums. The Royal Asylums at Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh,\r\nGlasgow, Montrose; the Crichton Institution, Dumfries, including the\r\nSouthern Counties Asylum; James Murray's Royal Asylum, Perth.\r\n\r\nB. Public asylums not incorporated. The only institution of the kind,\r\nthat of Elgin, was exclusively for paupers.\r\n\r\nC. Poor-houses with separate wards for the insane (twelve given in the\r\ntable).\r\n\r\nD. Prisons. The only one specially adapted for the reception of the\r\ninsane was the lunatic department of the general prison at Perth.\r\n\r\nE. Poor-houses without separate wards for the insane (fourteen given).\r\n\r\nF. Private asylums (twenty-three in number).\r\n\r\nG. Private houses reported to the sheriff.\r\n\r\nH. Houses of relatives and strangers.\r\n\r\nI. Schools for idiots. Baldovan, near Dundee; and Gayfield Square,\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\nThis Commission did not report until 1857, and unhappily the evidence\r\nmore than justified the necessity of the appointment of the Committee,\r\nand of a sweeping measure of reform. The difficulty in selecting\r\npassages from the Report is to know where to stop. We shall restrict\r\nourselves within moderate bounds; and first let us cite the reference to\r\nthe condition of the insane and idiotic not in asylums. \"It is obvious,\"\r\nsays the Report, \"that an appalling amount of misery prevails throughout\r\nScotland in this respect. When estimating the condition of the insane\r\nnot in establishments, it should be remembered that the details\r\nfurnished by us give only an imperfect representation of the true state\r\nof matters. They form only a part of the picture of misery; and, had we\r\nbeen able to extend our investigations, it would, we are convinced, have\r\nassumed a much darker shade.\r\n\r\n\"A practice prevails in some workhouses, as in a few of the licensed\r\nasylums, of fastening the hands behind the back, by which much\r\nunnecessary pain is inflicted on the patient.\"\r\n\r\nOf the methods employed in _asylums_ to repress violence, etc., the\r\nReport thus speaks:--\r\n\r\n\"_Instrumental Restraint and Seclusion._--Personal restraint by the\r\napplication of the strait waistcoat, or of the straps or muffs, is\r\nalmost entirely banished from the chartered asylums; but we have reason\r\nto think that seclusion for long periods is frequently used. This remark\r\napplies more especially to the asylums of Montrose, Glasgow, Aberdeen,\r\nand Edinburgh. In Montrose we found, on one occasion, eleven patients in\r\nseclusion out of a population of 174, several of them having been so\r\nsecluded for considerable periods, and one woman for several months; and\r\nit is to be observed that the seclusion rooms in this asylum are _mere\r\ncells, with stone floors and darkened windows_, and that the patients\r\nwho are placed in them are frequently allowed no other covering than\r\nblankets, and no other bedding than loose straw cast on the floor.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of the way in which one asylum was conducted: \"We have\r\ngrounds for fearing that the patients suffered from cold. The house is\r\ncarelessly conducted and the state of the patients very unsatisfactory.\r\nThe bed-frames, which are about the ordinary size with only spars of\r\nwood at the lower part, were dilapidated and saturated with filth; and\r\nthe quantity of straw in them was very scanty and mixed with refuse; it\r\nwas wet, offensive, and broken into small portions, and had clearly not\r\nbeen renewed for a considerable time. A certain number of the patients,\r\nmales as well as females, were stripped naked at night, and in some\r\ncases two, and in one case even three, of them were placed to sleep in\r\nthe same bed-frame, on loose straw, in a state of perfect nudity.\" The\r\nproprietor in his evidence says, \"I never go into the rooms at night.\r\nThe floor is constantly soaked with wet. There is an epileptic lad who\r\nis frequently fastened to the rings in the wall. The nurses keep the\r\nmuffs in their custody. I dare say half of the dirty patients would\r\nsleep naked; seven would, therefore, sleep with others, I cannot say\r\nthat more did not sleep together in a state of nudity. _I consider the\r\ntreatment is proper for them._\"\r\n\r\nAgain: \"The bad treatment of the patients, and the very unsatisfactory\r\ntreatment of the patients, are not fully known to the official\r\ninspectors. Indeed, it would appear that in some houses the instruments\r\nof restraint are systematically removed from the persons of the patients\r\nafter the arrival of the sheriff at the asylum, for we find in Dr.\r\nRenton's evidence that, speaking of L---- Asylum, in which two male\r\npatients are kept constantly in restraint by means of handcuffs, he\r\nsays, 'There are not many patients under restraint at L----.' And,\r\nfurther, in reference to Mrs. B----'s house at N----, he states, 'In\r\nMrs. B----'s house I don't think there are many cases of restraint.\r\nThere is a Miss W---- lately come, and a Miss M----. I don't think\r\nrestraint is used to them.' We have ascertained, however, that these two\r\npatients were frequently restrained. These instances might be\r\nmultiplied.\r\n\r\n\"_Rent is saved_ by placing patients in small houses, making them use\r\nthe same rooms both as day and sleeping accommodation; they are also\r\ncrowded into small airing-courts, inadequate to afford proper exercise\r\nand a proper separation of the sexes. The inmates during the winter\r\nmonths pass the greater part of each twenty-four hours in their bed,\r\n_whereby candle-light is saved_. In L---- Asylum, the patients are not\r\nallowed candle-light at any season.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot doubt that in many instances practices obviously wrong, and\r\ndetrimental to the patients, have been adopted in licensed houses,\r\nbecause an increased profit would thereby be obtained by the\r\nproprietor.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, both as regards licensed houses and unlicensed houses, the\r\nReport winds up by giving a dismal picture; for, as to the former, \"they\r\nare crowded in an extreme degree, profit is the principal object of the\r\nproprietors, and the securities against abuse are very inadequate;\" and\r\nas to the latter, they \"have been opened as trading concerns, for the\r\nreception of certain classes of patients who are detained in them\r\nwithout any safeguard whatever against ill-treatment and abuse.\" Strange\r\nto say, the persons properly authorized to inspect, did not avail\r\nthemselves of the powers of inspection granted them by law; and the\r\nofficials chose to interpret the law \"in conformity with their\r\nrespective views.\" Such was the unfortunate condition into which Scotch\r\nlunacy had drifted, at so comparatively recent a date as 1857, and out\r\nof which those who drew up the Report--Alexander E. Monteith, James\r\nCoxe, Samuel Gaskell, and William George Campbell--proposed to deliver\r\nit by the following remedial measures:--The erection of district or\r\ncounty asylums for pauper lunatics, including accommodation for the\r\ninsane belonging to the labouring classes, who are not strictly\r\npaupers. Likewise, more suitable accommodation for criminal lunatics.\r\nMeans for insuring greater caution and discrimination as regards the\r\nlicensing of houses for the reception of the insane; for imposing some\r\ncheck upon the licensing of new houses; and for conferring powers to\r\nclose those already opened for paupers so soon as public asylums shall\r\nbe erected, or at any other time, if not properly conducted. Regulations\r\nby which all pauper lunatics not in asylums shall be brought under\r\nproper visitation and care, and periodical reports be made as to their\r\ncondition by medical men, so as to afford a safeguard against abuse and\r\nill-treatment, and secure the ready and careful transmission of all\r\nproper cases to asylums. An accurate definition of the powers and duties\r\nof sheriffs in reference to the insane, so as to secure a more uniform\r\npractice and united action amongst them. Rules for the guidance of the\r\nBoard of Supervision, parochial boards, inspectors of poor, and district\r\nmedical officers in all matters relating to the management of the\r\ninsane. More complete regulations in reference to medical certificates;\r\nto prevent interested parties signing them; to specify the length of\r\ntime the document shall remain in force; and to require a statement of\r\nthe facts or evidence upon which the opinion as to the patient's\r\ninsanity is founded. Also a limitation of the time during which the\r\nsheriff's order shall remain in force, previous to the admission of the\r\npatient, and also in case of escape. The formation of a complete system\r\nof schedules and returns, together with full records of all admissions,\r\ndischarges, deaths, and accidents. Also the institution of registers\r\nand case-books, showing the medical treatment pursued in each case, and\r\nwhether, and to what extent, restraint and seclusion were employed.\r\nComprehensive regulations applicable to licensed houses and poor-houses,\r\nwhile continuing to receive lunatics, for securing to the patients\r\nsufficient medical and other attendance; kind and appropriate treatment;\r\nproper diet, clothing, bedding, exercise, and recreation; and adequate\r\nmeans of religious consolation. A requirement that, on recovery,\r\npatients shall be discharged by the medical attendant of the\r\nestablishment. Restrictions on the removal of pauper patients by\r\ninspectors before recovery. Precautions for preventing injustice in\r\ntransporting aliens. Better regulations as to dangerous and criminal\r\npatients. Measures by which persons labouring under insanity may\r\nvoluntarily place themselves under care in an asylum. Special\r\nregulations for prolonging control over cases of insanity arising from\r\nintoxication. Enactments for extending further protection to the\r\nproperty of lunatics, and for insuring the proper application of their\r\nfunds. The imposition of suitable penalties for infringement of the law,\r\nand power to modify them according to circumstances. Powers to raise\r\nsufficient funds for the purposes of the Act. The creation of a\r\ncompetent board, invested with due authority, to whom the general\r\nsuperintendence of the insane in Scotland shall be entrusted, including\r\npower to license houses for the reception of the insane; to visit all\r\nasylums, licensed houses, poor-houses, and houses containing only single\r\npatients; to order the removal of patients to or from an asylum, or\r\nfrom one asylum to another; to give leave of absence to convalescent\r\npatients; to regulate the diet in asylums and licensed houses for pauper\r\npatients; to make regulations for their management, etc., etc.; with\r\ndirection to report to the Secretary of State for the Home Department.\r\nThe formation of local boards for the management of individual asylums,\r\nwhich shall act in conjunction with the general board.\r\n\r\nLegislation followed in due time.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of May, 1857, Mr. Ellice,[232] the member for St. Andrew's,\r\nasked the Government what steps they intended to take for securing to\r\npauper lunatics in Scotland proper protection and maintenance, in order\r\nto alleviate the sufferings of the persons to whom the recent Report of\r\nthe Commissioners of Inquiry into the state of Lunatics in Scotland\r\nrelated. He was ashamed to have to admit that in that country,\r\nunfortunately, the state of things had been lamentably different from\r\nEngland and Ireland, where boards had been appointed under which,\r\ngenerally speaking, the law for the protection of lunatics had been\r\nsatisfactorily administered. In Scotland, instead of a Board of\r\nCommissioners specially appointed to take care of lunatics, the charge\r\nhad devolved upon the sheriffs of counties and the Board of Supervision,\r\nwhich latter body stood in the place of the Poor Law Board in this\r\ncountry. He charged the Scotch authorities with an almost total neglect\r\nof the duties which were incumbent upon them under the law, which \"in a\r\ngreat measure was very ample for the protection of the great proportion\r\nof the pauper lunatics in Scotland, if it were properly administered.\"\r\nThe powers and duties of the sheriffs, as laid down in the Act, were\r\namply sufficient. Yet the granting of licences, which was their duty,\r\nformed the exception, and, in fact, houses were opened generally without\r\nany licence whatever; the patients were detained without any order, or\r\nwithout even any medical certificate; if they died, their friends were\r\nnot informed of their deaths, which were not reported to any constituted\r\nauthority, \"the unfortunate persons disappearing in that mass of misery\r\nand filth which he should shortly depict.\" The pauper lunatics were\r\nunder the charge of the parochial boards. These were under the control\r\nof the Board of Supervision, sitting in Edinburgh, and similar to the\r\nPoor Law Board in London. The statute enacted that whenever any poor\r\nperson chargeable on the parish should become insane, the parochial\r\nboard should, within fourteen days of his being certified, take care\r\nthat he was properly lodged in an asylum. The Board of Supervision had,\r\nunder the same Act, peculiar power with respect to lunatics, and it was\r\ncompetent for them to dispense with an asylum, and allow the patient to\r\nremain with his friends under due inspection.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Supervision had absolute powers to dismiss any inspectors\r\nof the poor neglecting their duty to pauper lunatics. They acknowledged\r\ntheir obligation. In their first Report (1847) they, among other\r\npositive statements, affirm that they, in all cases in which they\r\ndispensed with the removal of pauper lunatics to asylums, were careful\r\nto preserve the necessary safeguards against abuse, by requiring a\r\nsatisfactory medical certificate as to treatment, and so on. Mr. Ellice\r\nthen showed that \"these statements had no foundation in fact; that they\r\nwere positively untruths, and entirely deceptive, year after year, as to\r\nthe real state of the lunatics in Scotland.\" In subsequent Reports the\r\nBoard boasted that it had endeavoured, not unsuccessfully, to improve\r\nthe condition of the insane, but Mr. Ellice showed that \"the condition\r\nand treatment of the pauper lunatics was diametrically opposite to what\r\nwas there stated.\" He knew that more legislation would be promised by\r\nthe Government, but the thing was to see that the law was enforced, and\r\nthat due notice should be taken of the conduct of the authorities who\r\nhad neglected their duties. He asked that a direct condemnation should\r\nbe passed upon them, and that they should be compelled, as in duty\r\nbound, to protect pauper lunatics from continued neglect and abuse. The\r\nmember for Aberdeen characterized the Report of Commissioners regarding\r\nthe state of the insane in his county as \"one of the most horrifying\r\ndocuments he had ever seen.\"[233] It was \"a state of things which they\r\ncould not before have believed to prevail in any civilized country, much\r\nless in this country, which laid peculiar claims to civilization, and\r\nboasted of its religious and humane principles.\"[234] \"Distressing as\r\nwere the cases which he had mentioned, there were others ten times worse\r\nremaining behind--so horrible, indeed, that he durst not venture to\r\nshock the feelings of the House by relating them.\"[235] Sir George Grey,\r\nafter saying that the Report on the treatment of lunatics in Scotland\r\ncontained statements of facts calculated to cast very great discredit\r\nupon that portion of the United Kingdom, admitted that the Board of\r\nSupervision was not free from blame, but thought the Report proved that\r\nthe guilt must be shared by the parochial boards, the inspectors of the\r\npoor, the sheriffs, the clergy, the justices of the peace, and by the\r\nCommissioners of Supply. By this ingenious homoeopathic dilution of the\r\nblame, it was easy to show that individual responsibility was\r\ninfinitesimal, and could not, therefore, be detected and punished in the\r\nway it so richly merited. Sir George Grey promised to introduce a Bill\r\ncalculated to remove the defects in the law established by the Reports,\r\nand deplored the fate of the Bill brought in by Lord Rutherfurd,[236]\r\nwhen Lord Advocate, which would, in his opinion, have remedied all the\r\nevils now complained of. It was \"referred to a Select Committee, but the\r\nopposition roused to it in Scotland, on the miserable ground of the\r\nexpense it would incur, proved fatal to the measure. I trust the\r\ndisgrace that now attaches to Scotland in this matter will be removed,\r\nand that this and the other House of Parliament will cordially\r\nco-operate with the Government in the adoption of those measures that\r\nare necessary for the relief and protection of the unfortunate class of\r\npersons referred to in the Report.\"[237] Mr. H. Drummond, who said he\r\nhad assisted Lord Rutherfurd to pass his Bill, also deplored its\r\nrejection. \"Both he and the Lord Advocate were beaten by the systematic\r\nopposition of every single person who was connected with the\r\nadministration of the system in Scotland. They would not give the\r\nreturns sought for ... and the ground of the opposition was the dread of\r\nthe dirty expense which might be incurred. From one to the other it\r\nappeared that the object of care in Scotland was property, not persons.\r\nThe way in which they treated the poor in Scotland was perfectly\r\nscandalous, and in nothing did the system appear so bad as in the\r\ntreatment of pauper lunatics, the rich lunatics being sufficiently well\r\ntaken care of.\" Mr. Drummond asked how it was \"that throughout the whole\r\nof Scotland there was not one clergyman who could find time to visit\r\nthese poor creatures? True, there was one, but when he went to the\r\nasylum he was refused admittance; and why? Because he was a Papist. The\r\nPoor Law, as managed by the Board of Supervision, had been well defined\r\nto be 'a law for depriving the poor of their just rights.'\"[238] Sir\r\nEdward Colebrooke, as one of the members for Scotland in the previous\r\nParliament, took his share of the blame that attached to the House in\r\nreference to Scotch asylums. In the Report issued in 1844, it was\r\nrecommended that more stringent provisions should be introduced into the\r\nlaw, but they had not been attended to. Mr. Kinnaird, the member for\r\nPerth, thought that the Scotch members owed a debt of gratitude to Mr.\r\nEllice for the manner in which he had laid the disgraceful feature in\r\nthe administration of the Scotch Poor Law before the House. He was glad\r\nto find that the Perth Asylum was not one which had disgraced\r\nScotland.[239] The Lord Advocate rejoiced at the publication of the\r\nReport, and the statements of Mr. Ellice, from the bottom of his heart,\r\nbecause the state of things had for a long time been a disgrace and a\r\nscandal to Scotland. \"The people of that country had known that it was a\r\ndisgrace and a scandal, and he regretted to add that it was not the\r\nfirst time that statements had been made similar to those to which they\r\nhad just listened. Had Lord Rutherfurd's Bill of 1848 been passed, this\r\ndisgraceful state of things would have been put an end to. But not a\r\nsingle petition was presented in its favour, while twelve of the largest\r\nand most important counties of Scotland petitioned against it! That\r\nnoble-minded lady, Miss Dix, went to Edinburgh and visited the asylums\r\nat Musselburgh. After seeing them, she said there was something wrong,\r\nand she wished to be allowed to visit them at the dead of night, when\r\nshe would not be expected. He felt a difficulty about giving a\r\npermission of that kind to a non-official person, and accordingly she\r\napplied to the Home Secretary. When asked by him his opinion of the\r\nsubject, he at once stated that the whole system with regard to the\r\ntreatment of lunacy in Scotland was utterly disgraceful, and that the\r\nevil could only be reached by a Commission of Inquiry. The facts were\r\nnow so clearly proved that if he proposed the very remedy which was\r\nrejected in 1848, it would be adopted by both Houses of Parliament\r\nwithout any important opposition.\"\r\n\r\nA Government Bill was brought in by the Lord Advocate, June 9, 1857, \"to\r\nalter and amend the laws respecting lunatics in Scotland.\" In\r\nintroducing it, he summarized the then law as follows:--The sheriffs of\r\nthe counties, the justices, and some other parties had the power and\r\nduty of inspection once or twice a year; certain registers were ordered\r\nto be kept and certain regulations made. But there was no uniformity;\r\nevery sheriff might interpret the Act as he pleased, and there was no\r\nobligation to erect asylums for the maintenance of lunatics. The duty\r\nwas thrown on the Procurator Fiscal of seeing the Act executed, but no\r\npower was given him to ascertain whether it was executed or not, and\r\nthere was no power of visitation. He need not say that these safeguards\r\nentirely failed, and the remedy he now proposed was that there should be\r\nappointed a Commission, an inspector-general who should be a medical\r\nman, a secretary, and a clerk; and that these should constitute the\r\nLunacy Board for Scotland, though not under that name. They would have\r\nthe power of granting and refusing licences for asylums. The sheriffs\r\nand the justices would retain the powers conferred on them already.\r\nScotland would be divided into districts, in which asylums would be\r\nerected by an assessment laid on for the purpose. The Lord Advocate made\r\na sort of formal defence of the Board of Supervision, of which he\r\nhimself had been a member, and pointed out that in their first Report\r\nthey had stated that the accommodation in the asylums was not equal to\r\nthat required for one-tenth of the number of pauper lunatics. Sir John\r\nMcNeill, who presided over the Board, when examined before the Select\r\nCommittee on Miscellaneous Expenditure in 1848, stated this fact\r\nstrongly. Mr. Ellice, however, adhered to the remarks he had previously\r\nmade, reasserted his accusations, and repeated that if the question were\r\nput to a jury, they would come to no other decision than that gross\r\nculpability existed on the part of the authorities, and he only\r\nregretted that the Government had not had the courage to say that the\r\nBoard of Supervision had deserved the condemnation of the House. Leave\r\nwas given to bring in the Bill.[240]\r\n\r\nOn the second reading[241] (June 9, 1857) no serious opposition was\r\noffered to the Bill, although an attempt was made to show that the\r\nCommission had been carried away by exaggerated statements. Mr. Bruce,\r\nthe member for Elginshire, who alleged this, hoped the Bill would not be\r\nhurried through the House that session. Mr. Blackburn, the member for\r\nStirlingshire, said he agreed with every Scotch member that a permanent\r\nboard would be of no use; it would be coercing the people by\r\ncentralization. Mr. Cowan, member for Edinburgh, said that he had been\r\nrequested to present a petition, signed by the Lord Provost and\r\nmagistrates of Edinburgh, seeking for delay, but he did not like to\r\nincur that responsibility, and would therefore support the second\r\nreading. Mr. Dunlop, the member for Greenock, assumed, for the sake of\r\nargument, that all persons in Scotland had done their duty; but even if\r\nthis were so, it was impossible but that cruelty and ill-treatment must\r\nhave taken place when they considered the way in which pauper lunatics\r\nwere treated, and he rejoiced that another session was not likely to\r\npass over without something being done to remove what was at once a\r\nnational calamity and a national crime, from Scotland.[242] Mr. Mackie,\r\nthe member for Kirkcudbrightshire, protested against the creation of a\r\nnew Board and the expensive machinery contemplated by the Bill. Sir\r\nWilliam Dunbar, the member for Wigton, agreed, and maintained that the\r\nexisting system was sufficient to insure all that was required. Sir John\r\nOgilvy, member for Dundee, said a strong feeling existed in Scotland\r\nthat the Board of Supervision furnished an efficient machinery capable\r\nof supplying all the defects of the present system, without the creation\r\nof a new Board. Mr. Hope Johnstone, member for Dumfriesshire, enforced\r\nthese remonstrances, by stating that he had representations made to him\r\nfrom every quarter in opposition to the appointment of a new Board. Mr.\r\nDrummond hereupon made an observation, greatly to his credit, which\r\ndeserves to be remembered. He said that the question was not so much\r\nwhat would be the most expensive as what would be the most efficient\r\nmachinery. There were plenty of representatives of the ratepayers in\r\nthat House, _but no representatives of the lunatics of Scotland_. They\r\nseemed to have no friends there, while really they were the persons who\r\nstood most in need of being represented.\r\n\r\nThe Act (20 and 21 Vict., c. 71) was passed August 25, 1857. It was\r\nentitled \"An Act for the Regulation of the Care and Treatment of\r\nLunatics, and for the Provision, Maintenance, and Regulation of Lunatic\r\nAsylums in Scotland.\" It repealed the Acts 55 Geo. III., c. 69; 9 Geo.\r\nIV., c. 34; and 4 and 5 Vict., c. 60.\r\n\r\nTo give a complete analysis of this most valuable Act, which consists of\r\nno less than 114 sections, would be wearisome to the reader. Its chief\r\nprovisions were these:--\r\n\r\nA Board of Commissioners in Lunacy for Scotland was to be appointed,\r\nconsisting of three unpaid and two paid Commissioners; the Secretary of\r\nState was empowered to appoint one or two medical men as Deputy\r\nCommissioners; public asylums founded after the passing of this Act were\r\nto be subject to it; the duties of the Commissioners as to inspection\r\nwere laid down; the sheriff was to visit and inspect asylums; private\r\nasylums were to be licensed by the Board; the patient was to be admitted\r\nby order of the sheriff on medical certificates; five shillings were to\r\nbe paid for the sheriff's order for the admission of a patient not being\r\na pauper, and half that sum for a pauper; the medical certificate was to\r\nspecify the facts on which opinion of insanity was founded; no\r\ncertificate was to be granted without examination, under penalty not\r\nexceeding L50, and if falsely granted, under a penalty not exceeding\r\nL300; houses where lunatics were detained under the order of the\r\nsheriff might be visited by the Board; one medical man was to be\r\nresident in every asylum licensed for a hundred patients or more, and a\r\nphysician was obliged to visit daily those for more than fifty patients;\r\nthose for fifty or less were to be visited at least twice in every week.\r\n\r\nScotland was divided into districts, set forth in a schedule, and a\r\ndistrict board was to be appointed within six months, which should\r\ninquire into the necessities of the district; the Board was to require\r\nthe district boards to provide district asylums; the provisions of 2 and\r\n3 Vict., c. 42, were to be applied to this Act; district asylums were to\r\nbe vested in district boards, and district inspectors were to be\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nPower was given to Public Works Loan Commissioners to lend money for\r\npurposes of the Act, provision being made for the money borrowed being\r\npaid off within thirty years.\r\n\r\nIn case the district asylum could accommodate more than the lunatics of\r\nthe district, other lunatics, it was enacted, might be admitted.\r\n\r\nWhether the property of a lunatic was or was not under judicial\r\nmanagement, if it was not property applied for his benefit, application\r\nwas to be made to the Court of Session.\r\n\r\nProvision was also made for cases where insanity stands in bar of trial;\r\nthe finding of the Court that the prisoner cannot be tried, to be\r\nfollowed by an order to be kept in strict custody during her Majesty's\r\npleasure; a lunatic acquitted of a criminal charge on the ground of\r\ninsanity, to be kept in custody by order of court in such place as it\r\nmay see fit, during her Majesty's pleasure; prisoners exhibiting\r\ninsanity when in confinement to be removed to an asylum, to remain there\r\nuntil it should be certified to one of her Majesty's Principal\r\nSecretaries of State by two medical men that such person has become of\r\nsound mind; whereupon the Secretary of State was authorized, if such\r\nperson's term of imprisonment had not ended, to issue his warrant to the\r\nsuperintendent, directing that such person should be removed back to\r\nprison, and if no longer subject to imprisonment, that he should be\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the liberation of patients from asylums, the certificates\r\nof two medical men approved by the sheriff were required, eight days'\r\nnotice being given to the person at whose instance such lunatic was\r\ndetained; the patient released to be entitled to a copy of order,\r\ncertificate, etc., on which he was confined.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of maltreating any lunatic was a fine not exceeding L100,\r\nor imprisonment for any period not exceeding six months, without\r\nprejudice to action for damages.\r\n\r\nPower was granted to the Secretary of State to order a special\r\nvisitation of any place where a lunatic was represented to be confined.\r\n\r\nThe inspectors of the poor were to give intimation of pauper lunatics\r\nwithin their parishes.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this Act is enhanced by the fact that its framers had\r\nthe advantage of a knowledge of the working of the great Acts of 1845\r\nand 1852 in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nAvailing ourselves now of the first Report of the Commissioners[243]\r\nwho were appointed under the foregoing Act, we shall present a statement\r\nof the number and distribution of the insane in Scotland on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1858.\r\n\r\n  -------------------+--------+----------+----------+--------+---------\r\n      Location.      | Males. | Females. |  Total.  |Private.| Paupers.\r\n  -------------------+--------+----------+----------+--------+---------\r\n  In public asylums  |  1226  |   1154   |   2380   |   786  |   1596\r\n  In private asylums |   330  |    415   |    745   |   219  |    526\r\n  In poor-houses     |   352  |    487   |    839   |     6  |    833\r\n  In private houses  |   810  |    974   |   1784   |   --   |   1784\r\n                     +--------+----------+----------+--------+---------\r\n              Total  |  2718  |   3030   | 5748[244]|  1011  |   4739\r\n  -------------------+--------+----------+----------+--------+---------\r\n\r\nThe above table does not include private single patients; their number\r\ncould not be accurately ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners, as might be expected, report the state of the insane\r\nto have altered little since the Report of the Royal Commission. In the\r\npauper licensed houses, if not in others, the overcrowding was great,\r\nthough diminishing. \"The patients, when within doors, are generally\r\nfound sitting in cheerless rooms, ranged on benches, listless and\r\nwithout occupation; and when out of doors, they are usually lounging\r\nsluggishly about the airing-courts, or are crouching in corners.\" Among\r\nfavourable indications noted by the Commissioners it is pleasant to read\r\nthe following:--\"Mechanical restraint has been entirely banished from\r\nthe licensed houses, and patients who are recorded in the Report of the\r\nRoyal Commissioners as almost always under restraint, are now habitually\r\nfree from their bonds. The improvement in the condition of these cases\r\nunder the more humane treatment now in use has been most remarkable, and\r\nis especially exemplified in the case of A. S----, a patient in M----\r\nAsylum.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequent Acts were passed, called for by the experience of the\r\nCommissioners in regard to the working of the Act of 1857, some\r\nimperfections in which were naturally discovered in the course of years.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Advocate and Sir George Grey brought in a Bill in 1862 to make\r\nfurther provision respecting lunacy in Scotland, which received the\r\nroyal assent July 29 (25 and 26 Vict., c. 54).\r\n\r\nBy this Act, consisting of twenty-five sections, the Board was empowered\r\nto license lunatic wards of workhouses; to sanction the reception of\r\npauper lunatics in workhouses; to grant special licences for reception\r\nin houses of not more than four lunatics; to grant licences to\r\ncharitable institutions for imbecile children without fee; to sanction\r\ndetention of pauper lunatics in asylums beyond the limits of their\r\ndistrict; to take such steps as the Board may consider requisite towards\r\nproviding accommodation for the district, etc., etc. Not to cite other\r\nsections, certain provisions of the recited Acts as were inconsistent\r\nwith the Act were repealed, and the General Board of Commissioners was,\r\nof course, continued.\r\n\r\nIn their Report of this year (1862) the Commissioners observe, relative\r\nto the supposed increase of insanity, \"Judging from the evidence which\r\nthe tables afford, the increase is almost entirely due to the\r\naccumulation of the numbers of the insane, and certainly not, to any\r\nmarked degree, to a greater disposition in modern times to mental\r\ndisease; for while in the years 1858, 1859, 1860, and 1861, the\r\n_admissions_ into asylums scarcely varied in number, the patients\r\nresident in such establishments showed every year a large and steady\r\nincrease. Thus, on January 1, 1858, their number amounted to 3765; on\r\nJanuary 1, 1859, to 4114; on January 1, 1860, to 4350; and on January 1,\r\n1861, to 4462.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the fact that more idiocy appears to be found in\r\nthe counties least exposed to mental activity. In this Report, however,\r\nthe Commissioners state that, as regards lunacy, its occurrence is\r\nconsiderably more frequent in _urban_ than in _rural_ districts. The\r\nword _occurring_ is here used advisedly in contradistinction to existing\r\nlunacy. The explanation offered by the Commissioners is that there is a\r\ngreater proportion of recoveries and deaths taking place among the\r\npatients of the rural district. They contrast the number of pauper\r\nlunatics intimated from urban populations with the number intimated from\r\nrural districts, and they find that in the former, the occurrence of\r\npauper lunacy as compared with its occurrence in the latter, is as 100\r\nto 54, whereas the proportion of existing pauper lunatics, January 1,\r\n1861, in the corresponding districts was as 100 to 106. The\r\nCommissioners regarded as urban those parishes containing towns, or\r\nparts of towns, having more than 20,000 inhabitants, and as rural all\r\nother parishes.\r\n\r\nWe need not dwell on the Act passed in 1864 (27 and 28 Vict., c. 59) to\r\ncontinue the Deputy Commissioners in Lunacy in Scotland, and to make\r\nfurther provision for their salaries and the clerk of the Board.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 another Act was passed (29 and 30 Vict., c. 51) to amend the\r\nActs relating to lunacy in Scotland, and to make further provision for\r\nthe care and treatment of lunatics. One or two of the provisions made\r\nmerit notice. Any person keeping a lunatic in a private house, although\r\nnot for gain, longer than one year, was obliged, if the malady required\r\ncompulsory confinement or restraint or coercion, to report to the Board,\r\nthat it might make inspection and obtain an order for the removal of\r\nsuch lunatic to an asylum. Regulations were made as to persons entering\r\nvoluntarily as boarders, whose mental condition is not such as to render\r\nit legal to grant certificates of insanity. Letters from patients to the\r\nBoard, and from the Board to patients, were to be delivered unopened.\r\nPower was given to apply to the Court of Sessions to obtain improved\r\ntreatment and care of any lunatic. Patients committed as dangerous\r\nlunatics might be liberated on the certificates of two medical men,\r\napproved by the Procurator Fiscal, that such lunatic may be discharged\r\nwithout risk of injury to the public or the lunatic. This is a valuable\r\nprovision. Power was given to the directors of asylums to grant\r\nsuperannuations to officers, etc.\r\n\r\nThe above Statute, passed in 1866 to amend the Acts relating to lunacy,\r\nwas succeeded, in a few years, by another statute having reference to a\r\nspecial class of the insane. Of this later Act in 1871 (34 and 35 Vict.,\r\nc. 55) to amend the laws relating to criminal and dangerous lunatics in\r\nScotland, it may be well to record the most important provisions. These\r\nwere to apply to persons detained by judgment prior to the Act 20 and 21\r\nVict., c. 71. The lunatic department in the general prison at Perth was\r\nto be relieved from overcrowding by removing the insane prisoners to\r\ndistrict, chartered, or private licensed asylums, with consent of\r\nmanagers of chartered and private asylums. As to the disposal of persons\r\nbecoming insane in local prisons, these were to be removed to a lunatic\r\nasylum by a warrant of the sheriff; all asylums in which pauper lunatics\r\nwere maintained by contract being bound to provide for the reception of\r\nsuch prisoner. The Act was to apply to any lunatic charged with assault\r\nor any offence, although not coming within the definition of a pauper.\r\n\r\nThere was in 1874 an interesting Parliamentary return, showing the total\r\nnumber of pauper lunatics in each of the three divisions of the United\r\nKingdom, and the estimated annual amount of the proposed grant of four\r\nshillings per head per week towards the maintenance of pauper lunatics\r\nin asylums.

The labours of the Commissioners had been followed by highly\r\nsatisfactory results, and it would be difficult to speak too highly of\r\nthe value of their Reports during these twenty years.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1878, 1569 patients were maintained from private sources,\r\n7473 by parochial rates, and 55 at the expense of the State.\r\n\r\nTwenty years before, the distribution of the insane was as follows.

The efficiency of the asylums in Scotland is\r\nnow such, owing in great measure to the action taken in 1857, that\r\nforeigners, not to say the English themselves, may cross the Tweed to\r\nlearn from the physicians of the mind, important lessons in the care and\r\ncure of the insane. The chartered asylums of that country have for a\r\nlong period received encomiums from those who have visited them.\r\n\r\nOf the Dumfries institution I have already spoken, and would add, in\r\nproof of the pains taken by the former superintendent, Dr. Browne, to\r\nbreak the monotony of asylum life, that he introduced private\r\ntheatricals, in which vaudevilles and farces were performed by and for\r\nthe lunatics, and even before the public. A practice still beneficially\r\npreserved is that of making excursions to places noted for their natural\r\nbeauty or antiquity, even temporary vacations at the seaside or\r\nelsewhere, constituting valuable novelties and auxiliaries in these\r\nministrations to the mind diseased. Such resources, in connection with\r\ndramatic festivities, attendance on all accessible entertainments in the\r\nneighbouring town, were utilized in affording a stimulus or a solace to\r\ninmates of the cultivated classes; nor were the higher aids yielded by\r\nreligious services and instructions neglected, and, with unwonted\r\nliberality of sentiment, chaplains representing the three grand sections\r\ninto which Christianity is divided, Presbyterianism, Episcopacy, and\r\nCatholicism, were appointed, and exercised their functions, it is\r\nbelieved, wisely and discreetly in their respective spheres. The benefit\r\nof this step suggested a resort to frequent intercourse between the\r\ndifferent ranks of patients, with associates from the external world,\r\nand the creation of all arrangements which could recall or assimilate\r\nsuch a place of seclusion with home, rational liberty, and natural\r\npursuits. Whilst the mingling of distinct grades was employed as a\r\nremedy, rigid classification was enforced, founded upon position in\r\nsociety, as well as upon the phase or stage of disease. In furtherance\r\nof this view it was resolved to remove the paupers and poorer inmates\r\nfrom the original structure, and to erect a distinct apartment, capable\r\nof containing four hundred individuals, within the grounds, provided\r\nwith all necessary requirements, but to be conducted with the most rigid\r\neconomy and consideration of the resources of the country, as well as of\r\nthe habits of the patients. This movement was made, and a hospital was\r\nadded, conducted, however, by the same superintendent and upon precisely\r\nthe same principles as regulated the Crichton Institution proper. We\r\nspeak confidently upon this and other points, because there is before\r\nus a series of valuable annual reports, containing not exclusively the\r\nhistory of the progress of the institution, but the results, medical and\r\nmoral, of the superintendent. For the behoof of both houses a museum of\r\nnatural history was formed, and proved a considerable attraction in\r\nstormy weather, or to lazy or lethargic observers. While in such a\r\nclimate it was inevitable that indoor objects of interest should be\r\nsupplied, attempts to draw those under treatment from the deteriorating\r\natmosphere of seclusion were not wanting. Parole was accessible to the\r\ntrustworthy, under suitable attendants; patients were allowed to travel\r\nlong distances, and for specific purposes, such as angling, botanizing,\r\nand so forth; their presence was permitted in the _fete champetre_ and\r\nin country sports, and every effort was made to give to anniversaries,\r\npublic and private, a prominent place in the annual calendar. But fun\r\nand frolic seem to have occupied but a subordinate place, as\r\ncomposition, re-education of every kind, classes for drawing,\r\nflower-making, dancing, singing, joining in concerts, are repeatedly\r\ninsisted upon. But while these engagements availed in winter,\r\npromenades, dances on the green, bowling, quoiting, the care of pet\r\nanimals, and, for a few, interest in the botanic garden, diversified the\r\nsummer months. These constitute a pleasing and encouraging part of the\r\npicture, but it should be broadly and boldly confessed that there were\r\nagitated and intractable spirits in the community that could not be\r\ntranquillized or guided by such agencies, and that, although restraint\r\nin its vulgar and repulsive aspects was not adopted, seclusion, padded\r\nrooms, and the conservative bed were occasionally in use. During the\r\nlast twenty years the asylum has been under the superintendence, first\r\nof Dr. Gilchrist, trained within its walls, and secondly of Dr. Adam,\r\nbut while there has been undoubted progress, the improvements and\r\nameliorations have been, to a certain extent, the evolution or\r\ndevelopment of the views and facts which have been above enumerated.\r\n\r\nI would add to what has already been said of the Royal Edinburgh Asylum,\r\nthat the managers appointed Dr. McKinnons, the first\r\nphysician-superintendent, in 1840, with complete administrative and\r\nmedical authority. He was a man of advanced ideas, as his reports show.\r\nOn his death in 1846, Dr. Skae was appointed his successor, and remained\r\nat his post till 1873, when Dr. Clouston became\r\nphysician-superintendent. Dr. Skae extended the reputation of the\r\ninstitution and consolidated its position. His reports were always\r\nmedical and philanthropic, and, as regards the general public, educative\r\nand interesting. By attracting public sympathy and not becoming too\r\nofficial, it has always carried out the original intention of its\r\nfounders to provide for all classes, and has now no less than eight\r\nhundred patients who pay from L30 up to L500 a year. It has a Charity\r\nFund of L10,000; its buildings are scattered, and number nine for\r\npatients. Like an old cathedral, it now shows, in common with\r\nlong-established institutions, such as the York Retreat, the successive\r\nideas of various men and various times, and one would really regret to\r\nsee the original shell of these charitable hospitals, though antiquated\r\nand a little inconvenient, ruthlessly destroyed to make way for modern\r\nstructures. In the Edinburgh Asylum are large corridor wards, pavilion\r\nwings of different kinds, cottages and cottage hospitals, a mansion in\r\nits own grounds, and a seaside house twelve miles off, to which over a\r\nhundred and twenty patients go annually. Its present superintendent has\r\nstill further extended the reputation of this asylum.\r\n\r\nWere the object of this work to describe institutions for the insane,\r\ninstead of giving a general historical sketch of the progress of reform,\r\nI should have added notices of other excellent institutions, as those of\r\nGartnavel, Glasgow, so ably superintended by Dr. Yellowlees, and the\r\nLenzie Asylum, where Dr. Rutherford has done wonders.\r\n\r\nOf the Scotch royal or chartered asylums and their far-seeing and\r\nphilanthropic founders it is not easy to speak too highly. For a small\r\ncountry and a poor people to have provided six asylums for all classes\r\nbefore the lunacy legislation of the present day was inaugurated, shows\r\nat least that, if it did not initiate a movement in favour of humanity,\r\nit could see how good a thing it was to follow in the same path. At the\r\npresent time in Scotland, through the foresight of the man who\r\nestablished institutions \"for all classes,\" and combined business with\r\nphilanthropy in making the rich help the poor, there is plenty of\r\nmiddle-class asylum accommodation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing could more strongly show what a change has come over\r\nthe condition of the insane in Scotland, and the praiseworthy efforts\r\nnow made by those who are responsible for it, than the excellent Report\r\nof the Commissioners, published in 1881.[248] \"It is well worth the\r\ncareful perusal of every one who is interested in the treatment of the\r\ninsane. In addition to the usual information, there is an attempt made\r\ncarefully to describe what is special to Scotland in the management of\r\nasylums and in the treatment of the insane. In short, the 'Scotch\r\nSystem' is analyzed, and in concise terms we are told what it is and\r\nwhat results have followed. In the body of the Report, under the heading\r\nof 'Recent Changes in the Modes of Administering Scotch Asylums,' we\r\nhave fourteen pages that well deserve and will attract much attention.\r\nThey will stand as a landmark in the history of the treatment of mental\r\ndisease. That portion of the Report is a most carefully written piece of\r\ntrue scientific work, containing the facts themselves, the history of\r\ntheir application, the inferences to be deduced from them, and the\r\nreasons why the particular results have happened, or the medical\r\nphilosophy of the matter....\r\n\r\n\"There were in Scotland on the 1st of January, 1881, 10,012 insane or\r\nidiotic persons known to the Scotch Board, being an increase of 378 over\r\nthe number of 1880. The greater part of this increase, which is an\r\nunusually large one for a year, consists of rate-paid lunacy. Scotland\r\nstill holds the honourable position of maintaining a far larger\r\nproportion of its insane and private patients than either of the other\r\ndivisions of the United Kingdom. In Ireland (assuming that all the\r\ninmates of private asylums are private patients) 5.5 per cent. only of\r\nthe insane are supported out of their own means or by their relatives.\r\nIn England 10.7 per cent. are so supported, while in Scotland 16.4 per\r\ncent. are in this category. Of this most remarkable fact we have seen no\r\nadequate explanation. Is it the poverty of Ireland and England that\r\nplace them so far below Scotland in this matter? or the want of asylum\r\naccommodation at low rates of board? or the lack of self-respect and\r\nnatural affection in the peoples?...\r\n\r\n\"There were forty-nine voluntary patients admitted to Scotch asylums\r\nduring the year, and the Commissioners express a favourable opinion as\r\nto this provision of the Scotch lunacy law. The recovery-rate in the\r\nasylums was 41 per cent. for the year, and the death-rate on the average\r\nnumbers resident 7.6 per cent.... The reports of the Commissioners'\r\nvisits to asylums are, on the whole, of a favourable character. There is\r\na cheerful ring about them, a hopeful spirit as to the remedies for\r\npresent defects, and an encouraging yet stimulating tone towards the\r\nmedical staff that shows a healthy confidence.\r\n\r\n\"We now come to the really original and important part of the Report:--\r\n\r\n\"'_Recent Changes in the Modes of Administering Scotch Asylums._--The\r\nmost important changes that have taken place of late have been\r\nmanifested chiefly in three directions:--\r\n\r\n\"'(1) In the greater amount of liberty accorded to the patients; (2) in\r\nthe increased attention that is devoted to their industrial occupation;\r\nand (3) in the more liberal arrangements that are made for their\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\n\"'Each of these changes has been a distinct improvement, and has\r\nconferred important benefits on the insane; but the effect of each has\r\nbeen made much more complete from the support it has obtained by being\r\nassociated with the others. For instance, the removal of restrictions\r\nupon liberty could not have been carried so far had steps not been taken\r\nto engage the energies of the patients in such occupations as tend both\r\nto check the morbid current of their thoughts and to prevent them from\r\nfretting at the control to which they must always be more or less\r\nsubjected, while it is no less true that the comforts with which they\r\nare now surrounded render them both more able and more willing to engage\r\nin healthful occupations....\r\n\r\n\"'_The Abolition of Airing-Courts._--Circumstances such as these,\r\nperhaps, prevent any immediate prospect of the universal abolition of\r\nwalled airing-courts; but the advantages which result from their disuse\r\nare now widely recognized. Most of the public asylums in Scotland are\r\nalready without them, while in several, where they still exist, they are\r\nseldom used. One of the advantages which airing-courts with walls were\r\nthought to possess was their supplying a place where patients suffering\r\nfrom maniacal excitement might work off their morbid energy in safety.\r\nIt can scarcely be denied, however, that the association in confined\r\nareas of patients in this state, either with one another or with other\r\npatients in calmer mental states, is attended with various\r\ndisadvantages. The presence of one such patient may be the cause of a\r\ngreat amount of excitement, and a source of irritation and annoyance to\r\nthose confined in an airing-court along with them. After the disuse of\r\nthe airing-courts, it was found that such patients could be treated\r\nsatisfactorily in the wider space of the general grounds. It was found\r\nby placing them more immediately in companionship with the attendants,\r\nand by keeping them from collision with other patients, that they could\r\nbe made to vent much of their excitement with less disorder, and could\r\noften be saved a considerable amount of it altogether.\r\n\r\n\"'_The Open-Door System._--It is only of late years that the disuse of\r\nlocked doors has been regarded as forming an important feature in the\r\nadministration of an asylum. Detached houses, or limited sections of the\r\nmain buildings, the inmates of which consisted chiefly of patients\r\nrequiring little supervision, have long been conducted in some\r\ninstitutions without locked doors. But the general practice of all large\r\nasylums has been to keep the doors of the various wards strictly under\r\nlock and key....\r\n\r\n\"'When an attendant could no longer trust to locked doors for the\r\ndetention of troublesome and discontented patients, it became necessary\r\nthat he should keep himself aware at all times of where they were and\r\nwhat they were doing. And it therefore became his interest to engage\r\nthem in such occupations as would make them contented, to provide an\r\norderly outlet for their energies, and to divert their minds from\r\nthoughts of escape. The relations of an attendant to his patient thus\r\nassumed less of the character of a gaoler, and more the character of a\r\ncompanion or nurse; and it was eventually found that this change in the\r\ncharacter of the form of control could be adopted in the treatment of a\r\nmuch larger number of the patients than was at first anticipated. It is\r\nnot difficult to over-estimate the extent to which a desire to escape\r\naffects the minds of patients in asylums. The number who form a definite\r\npurpose of this kind really constitutes only a very small proportion of\r\nthem. The special watchfulness required of attendants in guarding\r\nagainst determined efforts to escape, therefore, need be directed to a\r\nfew only of those under their charge, and it soon becomes habitual to\r\nthe attendants to keep themselves aware of where those patients are,\r\nabout whom they entertain doubt. And it should be borne in mind, in\r\nregard to this kind of watchfulness, that its very persistency renders\r\nit more easily kept up than if it could be occasionally relaxed. It\r\nappeared further that the disuse of locked doors had an influence on\r\nsome of the patients in diminishing the desire to escape. Under the\r\nsystem of locked doors, a patient with that desire was apt to allow his\r\nmind to be engrossed by the idea of watching for the opportunity of an\r\nopen door, and it was by no means infrequent to find such a patient\r\nwatching with cat-like eagerness for this chance. The effect of the\r\nconstantly open door upon such a patient, when the novelty of the thing\r\nhad worn off, was to deprive him of _special_ chances of escape on which\r\nto exercise his vigilance, since, so far as doors were to be considered,\r\nit was as easy to escape at one time as another; and it was found that\r\nthe desire often became dormant and inoperative if not called into\r\naction by the stimulus of _special_ opportunity. It is, indeed, a thing\r\nof common experience that the mere feeling of being locked in is\r\nsufficient to awaken a desire to get out. This happens both with the\r\nsane and the insane; but it is certain that the mental condition of many\r\npatients in asylums renders them likely to be influenced in an especial\r\nmanner by such a feeling. With many, however, the desire to escape dies\r\naway when it ceases to be suggested by forcing upon their attention the\r\nmeans of preventing it.\r\n\r\n\"'It is year by year becoming more clearly recognized that many\r\nadvantages result from the working of the open-door system, and it has\r\nnow been adopted to a greater or less extent in most of the Scotch\r\nasylums....\r\n\r\n\"'_Liberty on Parole._--The practice of permitting certain patients to\r\nwalk or work in the grounds without constant supervision, and of\r\npermitting some to take exercise beyond the grounds on _parole_, has\r\nbeen general in Scotch asylums for many years, but it is now much more\r\nextensively adopted in them than it used to be. Like the other removals\r\nof restrictions to which we have referred, this has found favour in the\r\neyes of superintendents on account of the beneficial effect which it\r\nhas on the patients, not merely in making their residence in an asylum\r\nless irksome, but also by improving their mental condition. The fears\r\nwhich were naturally entertained that this form of relaxation of control\r\nwould be followed by an increase in the number of accidents and escapes,\r\nhave not proved to be well founded.\r\n\r\n\"'In determining the desirability of any kind of restrictive discipline\r\nand supervision, it has to be considered, among other things, whether\r\nthe irritation that it occasions may not render the danger of accidents\r\nfrom violent conduct greater than it would be if such discipline were\r\nnot enforced....\r\n\r\n\"'_Benefits arising from the Removal of Restrictions._--The beneficial\r\neffects arising from the removal of the various forms of restrictions on\r\nliberty are no doubt due, in great measure, to the increased attention\r\nthat is given to the features of each patient's condition, for it is\r\nonly after a careful study of the disposition and tendencies of a\r\npatient that a trustworthy opinion can be formed as to the amount of\r\nliberty that he is fit to enjoy. But it must also be recognized that the\r\nfreedom from irksome discipline and restriction tends to remove one of\r\nthe sources of violent conduct in asylums, and consequently to diminish\r\nthe number of accidents which result from it. Many patients have, under\r\nthe freer conditions of their life, become calm and orderly in behaviour\r\nto whom the imprisonment in wards under lock and key, the confinement\r\nwithin high-walled airing-courts, and even the feeling of being under\r\nthe constant supervision of attendants, were sources of irritation and\r\nexcitement and causes of violent conduct.\r\n\r\n\"'There are other advantages which spring from this relinquishing of\r\nsome of the physical means of detention. One of these, the importance of\r\nwhich will be readily appreciated, is the inducement it affords, not\r\nonly to superintendents, but to every one concerned in the management of\r\nthe patients, to acquire a full and correct knowledge of the mental\r\ncondition and character of each patient. It not only increases the\r\ninterest they have in ascertaining how far, and in what ways, each\r\npatient is fit to be trusted, but it strengthens in a very practical\r\nmanner their motives for endeavouring to secure his contentment and\r\norderly behaviour. The judging of what is required for these purposes\r\ninevitably involves a good deal of intelligent observation of each\r\npatient, not only on admission, but during the whole time he is resident\r\nin the asylum. It becomes of practical importance to those in charge to\r\nnote changes in his mental condition, whether in the direction of\r\nimprovement or the reverse; and thus favourable or unfavourable symptoms\r\nare observed and considered which in other circumstances might receive\r\nlittle attention. The general effect of the change of system is to raise\r\nthe position of the attendants from being mere servants who carry out\r\nmore or less efficiently the orders of the superintendent to that of\r\npersons who have a direct interest in promoting the improvement of the\r\npatients, and who find it an advantage to themselves to carry out, to\r\nthe best of their ability, whatever instructions they receive with that\r\nend in view. A good attendant must always have had more or less of this\r\ncharacter, it is true; but even good attendants are stimulated under the\r\nfreer system to become still better.\r\n\r\n\"'_Industrial Occupation._--One effect of the removal of physical\r\nrestrictions has been to stimulate as well as aid the superintendents of\r\nasylums in their efforts to develop the industrial occupation of the\r\npatients. The disadvantages of prolonged idleness, to the insane as well\r\nas to the sane, and the advantages that result from such occupation as\r\ngives exercise to the physical and mental energies without overstraining\r\nthem, are too obvious to require discussion. It was consequently an\r\nimportant result of the disuse of walled airing-courts and of the\r\nopen-door system, that it became necessary to engage the attention of\r\npatients who were inclined to escape, and also of the much larger number\r\nwho might wander away without any such definite purpose, so as to keep\r\nthem under control and supervision. It did not require much study of the\r\nmental state of the patients, nor indeed much attention of any kind on\r\nthe part of their attendants, to insure their safe custody, when the\r\nconditions of their life were either to be locked within their wards, to\r\nbe confined within the high walls of airing-courts, or to be marched in\r\nmilitary order at stated periods for exercise. Under such conditions,\r\nthere was no strong motive for inducing those patients to work who\r\nshowed no disposition to do so of their own accord. The morbid\r\nexcitement, the apathies, or the gloomy feelings of many patients were\r\nallowed to remain unchecked, and not unfrequently the mental disease\r\nwas intensified rather than alleviated. The more restless patients often\r\nspent much of their day in pacing the galleries or the airing-courts,\r\nnursing their morbid irritability, while others lounged on the benches\r\nor crept into corners, and so drifted downwards through the dreary\r\nstages of physical and mental decay. It does not require much\r\nconsideration to show that it would tend to improve all such patients,\r\nboth in their bodily and mental health, if they were engaged in some\r\nregular occupation during a reasonable portion of their time....\r\n\r\n\"'_The Industrial System cannot be adapted to all Classes of\r\nPatients._--But there are patients, both among those of the private and\r\namong those of the pauper class, whom it is undesirable, and whom it\r\nwould also be wrong, to engage in work. There are cases, for instance,\r\nin which, for various reasons, such as physical weakness, it would be\r\ndirectly injurious to the patients to be engaged in active or fatiguing\r\nwork; and it would be unsatisfactory if it were found that the efforts\r\nto develop the industrial system in asylums led to such patients being\r\npressed to work....\r\n\r\n\"'_Advantage of the Farm as a Source of Occupation._--... The number of\r\npersons available for work on an asylum farm is always great; and in\r\nthose asylums where full advantage has been taken of the opportunities\r\nwhich the farm affords, it is found that the directions in which the\r\nlabour of patients may be utilized are much more numerous and various\r\nthan at first sight may appear. For instance, one large outlet for their\r\nlabour is supplied by the use of spade husbandry in circumstances in\r\nwhich the ordinary farmer would use the plough. Another outlet is to be\r\nfound in the cultivation of crops of garden vegetables, which the\r\nordinary farmer does not usually undertake. The carrying out of\r\nimprovements on the farm or estate also gives employments of various\r\nkinds, and it is here, perhaps, that what may be called the elasticity\r\nof land as a source of labour for asylum inmates becomes more evident.\r\nIf the land attached to an asylum is of any considerable extent, it will\r\nnearly always happen that important re-arrangements are deemed\r\ndesirable; and when there is a disposition to encourage improvements of\r\nthis kind, it is generally found that they afford a very abundant and\r\nvaried source of labour. Road-making, embanking, draining, fencing,\r\nplanting, and even building, are generally found to be required; and in\r\nconnection with these things, and with the work more accurately included\r\nunder the term agricultural, there are subsidiary forms of industry\r\ndeveloped. Indeed, the different kinds of work afforded by the\r\nre-arrangements and improvements on an estate prove of great value in\r\nasylum administration, for they afford some of the simplest kinds of\r\noutdoor labour. Many patients can be engaged in such occupations as\r\ndigging and wheeling, who can with difficulty be engaged in less simple\r\nkinds of work; and by securing an ample supply of such simple work the\r\nnumber of patients who share in the benefits of active healthy labour in\r\nthe open air is much increased....\r\n\r\n\"'It is impossible to dismiss the subject of asylum farms without some\r\nreference to the way in which they contribute to the mental health of\r\nthe inmates by affording subjects of interest to many of them. Even\r\namong patients drawn from urban districts, there are few to whom the\r\noperations of rural life present no features of interest; while to those\r\ndrawn from rural districts the horses, the oxen, the sheep, and the\r\ncrops are unfailing sources of attraction. The healthy mental action\r\nwhich we try to evoke in a somewhat artificial manner, by furnishing the\r\nwalls of the rooms in which the patients live, with artistic decoration,\r\nis naturally supplied by the farm. For one patient who will be stirred\r\nto rational reflection or conversation by such a thing as a picture,\r\ntwenty of the ordinary inmates of asylums will be so stirred in\r\nconnection with the prospects of the crops, the points of a horse, the\r\nillness of a cow, the lifting of the potatoes, the laying out of a road,\r\nthe growth of the trees, the state of the fences, or the sale of the\r\npigs.\r\n\r\n\"'_Importance of Active Physical Work for Women._--... An attempt,\r\nattended with considerable success, has been made in some asylums to\r\nsupply this deficiency by the development of the work of the laundry and\r\nwashing-house....\r\n\r\n\"'There are two directions in which the worth of the washing-house may\r\nbe developed. One is by obtaining work from outside sources, as has been\r\ndone in some institutions, where a considerable amount of washing and\r\ndressing is done for persons living in the neighbourhood. Another\r\ndirection is by avoiding the use in the washing-house of all machinery\r\nwhich diminishes the amount of hand labour. And we are disposed to\r\nregard both these modes as deserving of encouragement....\r\n\r\n\"'_Difficulties met with in carrying out Improvements._--... In relaxing\r\nrestrictions upon the liberty of the insane, there is a certain amount\r\nof prejudice in the public mind to be met and overcome. There is a\r\nfeeling of timidity in regard to persons labouring under insanity, which\r\nleads to their being regarded as without exception and in all\r\ncircumstances unfit to be trusted with any degree of liberty. As a\r\nresult of this, there is a tendency, when a patient in an asylum\r\ninflicts injury on others or on himself, to blame the superintendent for\r\nhaving permitted the patient to have such liberty of action as made the\r\ninflicting of the injury possible; and there is consequently a\r\ntemptation, to a superintendent who wishes to avoid adverse public\r\ncriticism, to adopt restrictive measures of the most complete character.\r\n\r\n\"'It was under the influence of such views that strait jackets,\r\nmanacles, and chains were used before the introduction of what is called\r\nthe system of non-restraint. When such restraints were used it was said\r\nthat no blame could be attached to persons in charge of a patient for\r\nany violent deed which might be perpetrated, because it was held that\r\nevery possible precaution had been taken to prevent it. The error that\r\nlurked beneath this statement was not perceived. It was not recognized\r\nthat in taking precautions against one set of evils, other evils of a\r\ngraver character were created. Even the evils which it was sought to\r\navoid were not avoided. The first man from whom Pinel removed the\r\nmanacles had, with those very manacles, killed one of his keepers. The\r\nsuperintendent who really takes most precautions against violence is not\r\nthe man who applies the most complete restrictions upon liberty, but he\r\nwho weighs the general results of different modes of treatment, and\r\nselects that which proves in practice most successful in decreasing the\r\nnumber of violent acts.\r\n\r\n\"'We cannot hope, in carrying out any system, to exclude the effect of\r\nmistakes in judgment and neglects of duty....\r\n\r\n\"'One difficulty for which no satisfactory solution has yet been found\r\nis the finding of employment for male patients during bad weather, when\r\nlittle outdoor occupation is to be had. It would be of great advantage\r\nif some simple indoor occupation, adapted to the peculiarities of the\r\ninsane, were devised which could be taken up occasionally when outdoor\r\noccupation failed....\r\n\r\n\"'_Increased Comfort of Asylums._--It is satisfactory to record our\r\nconviction that all the changes just alluded to have tended not only to\r\nfacilitate the administration of asylums, and to produce greater\r\ncontentment among the inmates, but also, to exert a real curative\r\ninfluence. The scenes of turbulence and excitement which used to be of\r\nfrequent occurrence in asylums have become much less frequent, and in\r\nthe asylums where the changes in question have been most fully carried\r\nout, such scenes are comparatively rare. It does not admit of doubt that\r\nthe occurrence of these fits of excitement had a deteriorating effect on\r\nthe mental condition of the patients, and often retarded, if they did\r\nnot in some cases prevent, their recovery. It is not unusual now to\r\npass through all the wards of some of the larger asylums without\r\nobserving a single instance of disorderly behaviour, and we believe this\r\nis properly attributed to such changes as have just been noted. It is\r\ntrue that excitement may, to some extent, be kept in check by the use of\r\ncalmative drugs; but we believe we are justified in saying that this\r\npractice is largely followed in no Scotch asylum, while it is scarcely\r\nadopted at all in those in which manifestations of excitement are least\r\nfrequent, in which restrictions on liberty are most completely\r\nwithdrawn, and in which industrial occupation has its greatest\r\ndevelopment.'\"\r\n\r\nLastly in regard to that most important point, on which Dr. Fraser thus\r\nspeaks:--\r\n\r\n\"'_The Influences which are at present operating on the Boarding out of\r\nLunatics._-- ... The influences which, from my experience and\r\nobservation, I believe to be operating upon these methods of provision\r\nfor the insane, especially upon the pauper portion, seem to me to be as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"'1. The efforts of medical officers of institutions to discharge\r\nchronic lunatics whom they consider suitable for being cared for in\r\nprivate dwellings.\r\n\r\n\"'2. The action of inspectors of poor in either initiating the removal\r\nof suitable cases, or in seconding the efforts of medical\r\nsuperintendents in this direction.\r\n\r\n\"'3. The amount and accessibility of asylum accommodation in each\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\"'4. The rate of maintenance in asylums.\r\n\r\n\"'5. The supply of suitable guardians.\r\n\r\n\"'6. The influence of the grant in aid.\r\n\r\n\"'_The Action of Medical Officers of Asylums._-- ... Owing to my having\r\nhad at one time the superintendence of the asylum for Fife and Kinross,\r\nI am able to deal more satisfactorily with the statistics of this\r\ndistrict than with those of other parts of the country. From a return\r\nwhich I have been favoured with, I find that the efforts to send out\r\npatients in this district have been effective and successful. During\r\n1880 there have been discharged improved eighteen patients, five of whom\r\nwere committed to the care of friends, and thirteen of whom were placed\r\nunder the guardianship of strangers....\r\n\r\n\"'The question which naturally suggests itself is--What would be the\r\nresult were this practice possible in every institution, and in every\r\ndistrict? On calculation I find that, had an equal proportion of the\r\ninmates of all asylums been similarly transferred to private care, no\r\nless than four hundred and three patients would have been removed from\r\ninstitutions to care in private dwellings, whereas the fact is that only\r\nsixty-eight were so transferred. Only one patient out of the eighteen\r\nwho were transferred from the Fife and Kinross Asylum has had to be\r\nreturned to the asylum, and he was one of those who were boarded with\r\nfriends....\r\n\r\n\"'_The Action of Inspectors of Poor._--The efforts of medical\r\nsuperintendents of asylums may do much, but it must be recognized that\r\nthe success and extension of the boarding system is largely, if not\r\nmainly, in the hands of the inspectors of poor. Their action is\r\nthreefold: (1) they may initiate the removal of their chronic insane\r\nfrom institutions; they may co-operate with asylum officers in readily\r\nremoving such lunatics as these officers intimate to be fit for being\r\nboarded out, and in procuring suitable guardians and homes for them; and\r\n(3) they may, by well-directed efforts, instead of hurrying every\r\nlunatic into an asylum, as the practice with some is, provide in like\r\nmanner for those idiotic and insane paupers who, even when they first\r\nbecome chargeable, do not require asylum treatment and care....\r\n\r\n\"'Economy, one of the proper objects of parochial administration, is\r\nattained by this method of providing for the insane poor, and not only\r\nis it economical, as I will immediately show, but for a large proportion\r\nof chronic lunatics it is efficient and beneficial. From a return with\r\nwhich I have been favoured from the City Parish, Edinburgh, the average\r\ncost, inclusive of supervision and every other item of expenditure, for\r\nthe insane boarded with strangers is L19 a year. The asylum rate during\r\nthe last five years has been L27 per annum.\r\n\r\n\"'_The Amount and Accessibility of Asylum Accommodation in each\r\nDistrict._-- ... It has now become a matter of everyday observation,\r\nthat where there is ample asylum accommodation the boarding out of the\r\ninsane is either entirely neglected or avoided, or but languidly\r\nattempted....\r\n\r\n\"'It follows that ample asylum accommodation though in itself a service\r\nand a safeguard to society, is yet apt to be an inducement to wasteful\r\nparochial administration....\r\n\r\n\"'_The Rate of Maintenance in Asylums._--In Dumfriesshire, where special\r\ncircumstances have kept the asylum rate exceptionally low, and where\r\nagricultural avocations are well paid, the guardians require a high rate\r\nof board, and thus the cost of boarding out, when clothing, medical\r\nvisits, and other expenses are included, is nearly equal to the rate of\r\nmaintenance in the asylum for the district.\r\n\r\n\"'It therefore stands to reason that where the asylum rate is near to\r\nthat required for outdoor care, the economic inducement to board out\r\nwill apply only to those patients who have friends willing to have the\r\ncharge of them. It thus appears that a low rate of maintenance in an\r\nasylum is practically prejudicial to the liberty of the chronic insane.\r\n\r\n\"'_The Supply of Guardians._--This feature of the system of boarding out\r\nthe insane will appear to many to be all-important. The excuse which\r\ninspectors frequently advance for their lack of co-operation with\r\nmedical officers of asylums is their inability to find suitable\r\nguardians. It is, however, an excuse which my experience does not permit\r\nme to regard as valid or sympathize with....\r\n\r\n\"'_The Influence of the Government Grant._--I feel I need do no more\r\nthan mention this agency in increasing the number on the roll of single\r\npatients. The way in which it has led to this increase has been fully\r\ntreated of in the published Reports of the Board....'\"\r\n\r\nAmong the foregoing excerpts from the elaborate Report of the\r\nCommissioners, much, it will be seen, bears on the important question of\r\nthe \"cottage treatment\" of the insane. In this direction, at least in\r\nthe way of attempting to form a sort of lunatic colony (though on a very\r\nminute scale) after the manner of Gheel, Scotland has acted more\r\ndefinitely than England. Opinion is divided on the subject, and the\r\nmeasure of success can hardly be said to have been yet determined.\r\nWhatever this may be, the counter disadvantages must not be overlooked.\r\nKennoway, in Fifeshire, where the experiment has been tried on a small\r\nscale, has had its supporters and detractors. Dr. John Smith, well known\r\nfor his long practical experience of lunacy, and Dr. J. B. Tuke, at that\r\ntime the superintendent of the admirably managed Fife and Kinross\r\nAsylum, visited Kennoway some years ago, and the report[249] of the\r\nlatter was certainly anything but favourable; in fact, that the saving\r\neffected was by means detrimental to the lunatic. Notwithstanding, he\r\narrived at the conclusion that the system might be employed with\r\nadvantage in certain cases, if accompanied by stringent supervision. Dr.\r\nArthur Mitchell, in his evidence before the Parliamentary Committee of\r\n1877, so valuable on all the points to which he spoke, replied to the\r\nquestion why the patients boarded out had decreased in number, if the\r\nboard approved of the system, that he, although warmly approving of it,\r\nwas the person who had largely caused this decrease, the reason being\r\nthat it was found there were a great number of persons totally\r\nunsuitable for private dwellings, and others were ill cared for. Hence\r\nit was necessary to weed them out. This observation does not specially\r\napply to villages like Kennoway, but to the boarded-out cases, wherever\r\nplaced.[250]\r\n\r\nMuch more of interest might be taken from this Report, but the foregoing\r\nwill suffice to bring before the reader the salient points in the\r\nmanagement of the insane in Scotland at the present day, by which he can\r\njudge for himself of the contrast between the present and the past. My\r\nmain object is with the latter, but it can only be understood by a\r\nsketch, however brief, of the former, in each of the three divisions of\r\nthe United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[227] These particulars are given in the Report of the Royal Lunacy\r\nCommission for Scotland, 1857, on the authority of Sir Thomas Craig.\r\n\r\n[228] \"A General View of the Present State of Lunatics and Lunatic\r\nAsylums in Great Britain and Ireland,\" by Sir Andrew Halliday, M.D., p.\r\n28.\r\n\r\n[229] _Op. cit._, p. 27.\r\n\r\n[230] \"An Act to Regulate Madhouses in Scotland.\"\r\n\r\n[231] \"The Commission was entirely due to Miss Dix's exertion.

She came to London and placed herself in communication with\r\nthe Secretary of State for the Home Department, and with the Duke of\r\nArgyll; and at her instance, and without any public movement on the\r\nsubject, a Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the state of\r\nthe lunatic asylums of Scotland.

The change which in our practical\r\nage has taken place in Kerry, by the substitution of a well-ordered\r\nasylum at Killarney, for popular superstitious practices, represents\r\nwhat has been going on throughout the whole of Ireland during the last\r\nhalf century or more. After examining all the Acts bearing on the\r\nprovision for the insane from the earliest period, and the evidence\r\ngiven before Parliamentary Committees, I must say I find a very large\r\namount of strenuous effort and labour devoted to the improvement of the\r\ncondition of lunatics, miserably situated as they formerly were in\r\ngeneral, when confined in houses of industry or at home in hovels, where\r\ntheir needs could not possibly be attended to, even when, as was\r\ndoubtless frequently the case, they were regarded with great affection.\r\nSometimes they were looked upon as possessed, and then the appropriate\r\nforms of the Church of Rome were employed.\r\n\r\nIn the evidence given before the Select Committee on the Lunatic Poor\r\nin Ireland in 1817, Mr. John Leslie Foster, a governor of the Richmond\r\nAsylum,[251] stated that he had seen two or three lunatics in one bed in\r\nthe house of industry. There were fifty or sixty in one room. In the\r\nsame room a lunatic was chained in a bed, the other half of which was\r\noccupied by a sane pauper, and the room was so occupied by beds that\r\nthere was scarcely space to move in it.\r\n\r\nMr. Rice stated that when he visited the Clonmel Asylum in 1814-15, the\r\npatients were not clothed; some were lying in the yard on the straw in a\r\nstate of nakedness. At Limerick he found the accommodation for the\r\npatients \"such as we should not appropriate for our dog-kennels.\" There\r\nwas one open arcade, behind which cells were constructed with stone\r\nfloors, without any mode of heating or of ventilation, and exposed\r\nduring the whole of the winter to the extremities of the weather.\r\nThirteen cells were provided for thirty-three lunatics and idiots. As\r\nsome were furious, the usual mode of restraint consisted of passing\r\ntheir hands under their knees, fastening them with manacles, securing\r\ntheir ankles by bolts, passing a chain over all, and lastly attaching\r\nthem firmly to the bed. \"In this state, I can assure the Committee from\r\nmy own knowledge, they have continued for years, and the result has been\r\nthat they have so far lost the use of their limbs that they are utterly\r\nincapable of rising.\" The rooms over the cells were appropriated to the\r\nsick. Mr. Rice found twenty-four persons lying in one room, some old,\r\nsome infirm, and in the centre of the room a corpse; one or two were\r\ndying. In the adjoining room he found a woman in a state of distraction,\r\nthe corpse of her child left upon her knees for two days; it was almost\r\nputrid. \"There was not to be found one attendant who would perform the\r\ncommon duties of humanity. The most atrocious profligacy in another\r\nbranch of the establishment prevailed.\"\r\n\r\nThe condition of a lunatic member of a family among the poor is thus\r\ngraphically described by a member of the Committee which prepared this\r\nvaluable Report: \"There is nothing so shocking as madness in the cabin\r\nof the peasant, where the man is out labouring in the fields for his\r\nbread, and the care of the woman of the house is scarcely sufficient for\r\nthe attendance on the children. When a strong man or woman gets the\r\ncomplaint, the only way they have to manage is _by making a hole in the\r\nfloor of the cabin_, not high enough for the person to stand up in, with\r\na crib over it to prevent his getting up. The hole is about five feet\r\ndeep, and they give this wretched being his food there, and there he\r\ngenerally dies. Of all human calamity I know of none equal to this, in\r\nthe country part of Ireland, which I am acquainted with.\"\r\n\r\nIn the physician's report of one asylum for 1816, he speaks of the\r\nmiserable objects who wander over the face of the country, or are\r\ninmates of jails and hospitals. Such do not appear to have taken refuge\r\nin any Glen-na-galt.\r\n\r\nThe first asylum for the insane in Ireland (and the only one before the\r\nRichmond Asylum) was that founded in Dublin by Swift, whose act would\r\nprobably have been little known or forgotten, but for the familiar lines\r\nin which he himself has immortalized it:--\r\n\r\n    \"He gave the little wealth he had\r\n     To build a house for fools or mad,\r\n     To show by one satiric touch\r\n     No nation needed it so much.\"\r\n\r\nThis asylum was opened in 1745, the population being then between three\r\nand four millions. What really induced the Dean of St. Patrick's to\r\nperform this act was the knowledge that there was no charitable asylum\r\nfor the insane--nothing more; at any rate, I am not aware that he\r\ncontemplated the introduction of any improved method of treatment, or\r\nwould have thought that chains were unsuitable means of restraint. It\r\nappears that his attention had been called to the need of an asylum by\r\n\"The Proposal\" of Sir William Fownes. Swift bequeathed the whole of his\r\nestate and effects, subject to certain small legacies, to be laid out in\r\nthe purchase of land for a hospital large enough for the reception of as\r\nmany idiots and lunatics as the income of the said lands and effects\r\nshould be sufficient to maintain.\r\n\r\nFrom its historical associations I was interested in visiting this\r\nasylum some years ago, but there is nothing otherwise of special\r\ninterest in the institution. Writing in 1861,[252] the Inspectors of\r\nIrish Asylums observe, \"Though subject to our inspection, it is not a\r\nregularly licensed asylum, being on a charitable foundation. It is\r\nunfortunately situated in a most inappropriate locality, and very\r\ndeficient, from its original construction, in many necessaries.\" And the\r\nLunacy Inquiry Commission of 1879 observe, \"We feel ourselves compelled\r\nto state that St. Patrick's Hospital, though possessing an ample\r\nendowment, with an accumulated fund in bank of L20,000, and situated in\r\nthe metropolis, is yet in many respects one of the most defective\r\ninstitutions for the treatment of the insane which we have visited....\r\nThe patients wash in tubs in the day-rooms, the water having to be\r\ncarried all through the house, as no supply is laid on; the hospital is\r\nnot lighted with gas 'for fear of explosion'! and passages nearly four\r\nhundred feet long have, on winter evenings, no other light than that\r\nwhich is afforded by three or four small candles.\" The house was badly\r\nwarmed, and the ventilation far from satisfactory.\r\n\r\nFurther, while the Dean's will did not contemplate the payments of\r\npatients, boarders were admitted at an early period, and this policy\r\nwent to such a length that while in 1800 there were a hundred and six\r\nfree and only fifty-two paying patients, there were in 1857 eighty-eight\r\npaying patients, and only sixty-six free. As the Commission naively\r\nremark, \"if the diminution of free patients and the increase of paying\r\npatients are to continue, it may one day result that no inmates of Dean\r\nSwift's Hospital will be maintained entirely out of his bequest, which\r\ncertainly does not appear to have been in the contemplation of the\r\nfounder.\"[253] A somewhat brighter picture might have been expected when\r\none reflects that, according to the original charter, the government of\r\nthe hospital was vested in the Primate, Lord Chancellor, Archbishop of\r\nDublin, Dean of St. Patrick's, Dean of Christ Church, Physician to the\r\nState, and Surgeon-General, and seven other persons whose successors\r\nwere to be elected by a majority of the governors, each of whom was\r\nrequired to be a fit person.\r\n\r\nAn asylum was erected at Limerick about 1777, and at Cork in 1788.\r\n\r\nThe Cork Asylum was built on the strength of an unrepealed section in an\r\nold Jail Act (27 Geo. III., c. 39. s. 8), which allowed of sums of\r\npublic money to be \"presented\" by grand juries for the use of lunatic\r\nasylums, without limit, and permitted magistrates to commit to them any\r\nindividuals, if idiots or insane. It did not provide, however, for the\r\ngovernment of the establishment when formed, or for an account of how\r\nthe money was spent. No medical certificates were required--the\r\nmagistrate's power was unlimited. Fortunately, however, the Cork Asylum\r\nwas in good hands (Dr. Hallaran), thanks to which, and not to the law,\r\nthe institution was as well conducted as in those days it could be. So\r\nmuch was this the case that Mr. Rice stated before the Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons in 1817, that it was the best managed he had ever seen\r\nor heard of, realizing, he added, all the advantages of the York\r\nRetreat. He, however, protested against the system under which it, like\r\nother asylums, was conducted as radically wrong; its success was a\r\nsuccess of circumstances, almost of accident.\r\n\r\nThis Prison Act was at this date the only law which regulated Irish\r\nasylums, the only statute by which they could be carried on. All, in\r\nfact, depended upon the humanity, skill, and conscientiousness of the\r\nsuperintendent.[254] I believe, as a matter of fact, Cork was the only\r\ncounty which made use of it.\r\n\r\nSo far back as 1804, a Select Committee of the House of Commons was\r\nappointed to consider the provision for the insane in Ireland, and\r\nreported that the provisions of the Act 27 Geo. III., c. 39, empowering\r\ngrand juries to present the sums necessary for support of a ward for\r\nidiots and lunatics, have not been complied with, and that the demand\r\nfor admission into houses of industry greatly exceeds the accommodation\r\nor funds appointed for their support, and that it does not appear that\r\nany institution, maintained in any degree at the public expense, exists\r\nin any other part of Ireland than Dublin, Cork, Waterford, and Limerick,\r\nfor their reception. The Committee resolved that the attention and care\r\nnecessary for the effectual relief of these distressed objects cannot be\r\nefficaciously extended to them whilst they are connected with\r\ninstitutions of a very different nature, and that the establishment of\r\nfour asylums for idiots and lunatics, one in each of the provinces of\r\nIreland, would be a measure highly beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe result of this Report was that on the 21st of March, 1805, leave\r\nwas given to bring in a Bill for establishing in Ireland four provincial\r\nasylums, appropriated exclusively to lunatics and idiots--thus providing\r\nfor a thousand patients. This excellent Bill shared the fate of so many\r\nBills for English lunatics, and did not become law.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that in the Report of the Select Committee (1815)\r\nto inquire into the state of English mad-houses, it is stated that the\r\nnecessity of making some further provision for insane persons appeared\r\nto be more urgent in Ireland than in England, as, \"with the exception of\r\ntwo public establishments and some private houses, there are no places\r\nappropriated separately for the insane.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1810 the Government urged upon the House of Commons the necessity of\r\naffording some relief to the neglected condition of the insane poor in\r\nIreland, the result being that grants were made for building an asylum\r\nin Dublin, called \"The Richmond Lunatic Asylum\" (55 Geo. III., c. 107).\r\nIt was opened in 1815, and proved a great boon to the district. Two\r\nyears afterwards, Mr. John Leslie Foster, one of the governors, in\r\nevidence before the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the\r\nlunatic poor in Ireland, referred to the humane system of treatment\r\nintroduced at the York Retreat, \"the good effects of which are\r\nillustrated in a publication[255] of Mr. Tuke,\" and said, \"This system\r\nappearing to the governors of the Richmond Lunatic Asylum to be founded\r\nin good sense, they determined on trying the experiment in their new\r\ninstitution, and beg to add, as a proof of this, that there is not in\r\nthe Richmond Asylum, to the best of my belief, a chain, a fetter, or a\r\nhandcuff. I do not believe there is one patient out of twenty confined\r\nto his cell, and that of those who are confined to their cells, in the\r\ngreat number it is owing to derangement of their bodily health rather\r\nthan to the violence of mania.\" He speaks of the superintendent as the\r\n\"moral governor,\" whose particular business it is to attend to the\r\ncomforts of the patients, to remove from them causes of irritation, to\r\nregulate the degrees of restraint, and to provide occupation for the\r\nconvalescent.\r\n\r\nThe Richmond Asylum did not serve, as was hoped and expected at that\r\ntime, to supply accommodation for a large portion of Ireland. To the\r\namazement of those who had induced Parliament to make what they deemed\r\nso ample a provision, it was soon found that not only was the asylum\r\nfull to overflowing, but the house of industry was soon as full as\r\nbefore, and that as to finding accommodation for those at a distance, it\r\nwas altogether out of the question. At first, sanguine hopes were raised\r\nby the large number of recent cases discharged cured, and the common but\r\nfallacious inference was drawn that, had all the chronic cases in the\r\nhouses of industry or at large been fortunate enough to be placed under\r\nasylum treatment in the first stage of their malady, they would also\r\nhave been cured in like proportion. Unfortunately, the accumulation of\r\nincurables, even in asylums, opened the eyes of many to the fallacy of\r\nthis inference.[256] Other asylums were, therefore, it was seen,\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\"Your Committee,\" observe the Select Committee of the House of Commons\r\nof 1817,[257] \"beg leave to call the attention of the House to the\r\ndetailed opinion expressed by the governors of the Richmond Asylum, that\r\nthe only mode of effectual relief will be found in the formation of\r\ndistrict asylums, exclusively appropriated to the reception of the\r\ninsane.\" It appeared that, with the exception of the Dublin institution,\r\nthat at Cork, and one at Tipperary, there was not provision made for\r\nmore than one hundred lunatics throughout the whole of Ireland. The\r\nCommittee proposed that, in addition to the asylums in Dublin and Cork,\r\nthere should be built four or five additional asylums, capable of\r\ncontaining a hundred and twenty to a hundred and fifty lunatics each.\r\nThey recommended that powers should be given to the Government to divide\r\nIreland into districts, and that the expense should be borne by the\r\ncounties included within the several districts. The consequence of this\r\nReport was the Act 57 Geo. III., c. 136,[258] afterwards repealed, but\r\nre-enacted with amendments by the 1 and 2 Geo. IV., c. 33; 6 Geo. IV.,\r\nc. 54; and 7 Geo. IV., c. 14. These statutes enacted that the cost of\r\nasylums, advanced from the Consolidated Fund, was to be ultimately paid\r\nby the counties; that all the principal officers were to be appointed by\r\nthe Lord Lieutenant, the general superintendence being vested in a Board\r\nof Commissioners, named by the Government but acting gratuitously; that\r\nthe asylums should be brought under the annual review of the\r\ninspectors-general of prisons by the 7 Geo. V., c. 74, and should be\r\nnoticed in the reports submitted annually to Parliament. The\r\ninspectors-general had power to enter private as well as public asylums.\r\n\r\nThe first really effective Act of Parliament, directing the erection of\r\nasylums for the insane poor in Ireland, was, then, that which we have\r\nmentioned as passed in the year 1821, and formed the 1 and 2 Geo. IV.,\r\nc. 33.[259] The Lord Lieutenant (not the justices, as in England) was\r\nauthorized to establish any number of these asylums (to accommodate not\r\nless than one hundred and not more than one hundred and fifty paupers)\r\nwhen and where it seemed expedient, while for this purpose eight\r\nCommissioners were nominated to superintend the execution of the work.\r\nSome years elapsed before asylums were built. Then nine, capable of\r\naccommodating nine hundred and eighty patients, were commenced at\r\nArmagh, Ballinasloe, Carlow, Clonmel, Limerick, Londonderry,\r\nMaryborough, and Waterford, for their respective districts, some being\r\ncomposed of no less than five counties. It is stated that such was the\r\ndislike of the humbler classes to the name of mad-houses, that they\r\nwere not fully occupied until 1835. The eight Commissioners retired, and\r\nthe Board of Works took their duties upon them, and acted until 1861,\r\nwhen the 18 and 19 Vict., c. 109, enacted that two members of the Board,\r\nincluding the chairman, and the two Inspectors of the insane, should be\r\nappointed Commissioners of general control and correspondence.[260]\r\n\r\nThe grand juries of assizes were to present such sums as should be\r\nrequired for asylums. In 1826 an Act was passed (7 Geo. IV., c. 74)\r\nwhich continued and extended the former provisions, viz. that the\r\ninspectors-general of prisons should be inspectors of lunatic asylums in\r\nIreland; that no person should keep a house for the reception of insane\r\npersons unless licensed; that justices of the peace might grant them;\r\nthat no person should be received into or retained in a licensed or\r\nunlicensed house without an order and the certificate of a medical man\r\nnot interested in such houses; that licensed houses not kept by a\r\nphysician should be visited by a medical man once a fortnight; that the\r\ninspector must visit such houses once in six months, and may make\r\nspecial visits, and after two such visits may liberate a patient; and\r\nthat the inspectors should make an annual report to the Lord Lieutenant\r\nand Lord Chancellor. This Act did not apply to public asylums. It was to\r\ncommence and take effect in the county and city of Dublin, and to remain\r\nin force till August 1, 1845. It may be well to note here that in 1826\r\n\"the numbers of lunatics and idiots in every public asylum in Dublin,\r\nand in every asylum in Ireland,\"[261] erected under the provisions of\r\nthe Act 1 and 2 Geo.

Lamb:--\r\n\r\n\"In reference to the paragraph in Mr. Spring Rice's letter [to Mr. Lamb]\r\nwhich suggests the inquiry how far the asylums in Ireland have proved\r\neffectual, I am directed to state that a very considerable accumulation\r\nof incurable lunatics has taken place in this asylum within the last few\r\nyears, and for the reception of whom the House of Industry is\r\ninadequate. In consequence the Richmond Lunatic Asylum, which was\r\nestablished for the relief of curable lunatics, is at present occupied\r\nby one hundred and seventeen patients, whom the medical officer deems\r\nincurable. I am likewise directed to state that, notwithstanding the\r\nrelief afforded by two provincial asylums now open for the reception of\r\npatients, viz. Limerick and Armagh, the number of applicants for\r\nadmission to this asylum has not diminished.\"[262]\r\n\r\nOne is amused, even while wading through these dry Parliamentary returns\r\non a painful subject, by meeting with such a passage as the following,\r\nwritten by Dr. Thomas Carey Osborne in his report of the Cork Asylum.\r\nSpeaking of the symptoms of a young maniac, cured by electricity, he\r\nsays, \"When in the yard, he would look intently on the sun if permitted,\r\nuntil the _albuginea_ became scarlet, and the tears flowed down the\r\ncheeks, unconscious of inconvenience.\" His report is very pedantic, full\r\nof quotations from the Scriptures, Shakespeare, and other poets. His\r\nstyle is shown in what he says of Dr. Hallaran, his excellent\r\npredecessor in office at the Cork Asylum for more than thirty years,\r\nwhen he informs his reader that the \"infuriated maniac and the almost\r\nsenseless idiot expressed sorrow for his decease and deplored him as a\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nOne case reported by the doctor is worth recording. He had been some\r\nyears under treatment, and his insanity was attributed to the loss of a\r\nhooker off the western coast, his only property, which he had purchased\r\nafter much toil as a fisherman. His character was melancholic, and he\r\nconducted himself with propriety. He was appointed door-keeper, and\r\nfilled his situation with such kindness and good humour that he was\r\ngenerally esteemed. He had the whimsical illusion of having been\r\nintroduced into the world in the form of a salmon, and caught by some\r\nfisherman off Kinsale. He was found one morning hanging by a strip of\r\nhis blanket to an old mop nail, which he had fixed between the partition\r\nboards of his cell, having taken the precaution of laying his mattress\r\nunder him to prevent noise in case of his falling.[263]\r\n\r\nIn 1827 the total number of persons in confinement was reported to be:--\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------+-----------+---------+-----------\r\n      Location.                    | Lunatics. | Idiots. |   Totals.\r\n  ---------------------------------+-----------+---------+-----------\r\n  Richmond Asylum                  |       168 |     112 |       280\r\n  Lunatic ward of House of Industry|       442 |      -- |       442\r\n  Private asylums (4) near Dublin  |       101 |      -- |       101\r\n  City and County Asylum, Cork     |       138 |      64 |       202\r\n  Asylum at Waterford              |       103 |      -- |       103\r\n       \"    Armagh                 |        64 |      -- |        64\r\n  Jail at Lifford                  |        18 |      -- |        18\r\n  Private house, Downpatrick       |        17 |      -- |        17\r\n  County Infirmary, Derry          |        12 |      -- |        12\r\n  Old Jail, Roscommon              |        19 |      -- |        19\r\n  Asylum, Ennis                    |        14 |      -- |        14\r\n      \"   Kilkenny                 |        14 |      -- |        14\r\n  House of Industry, Tipperary     |        32 |      -- |        32\r\n        \"            Waterford     |        57 |      48 |       105\r\n        \"            Wexford       |        37 |      -- |        37\r\n  Asylum, Limerick                 |        74 |      -- |        74\r\n  Dean Swift's Hospital            |        50 |      -- |(about) 50\r\n                                   +-----------+---------+------------\r\n                            Total  |      1360 |     224 |       1584\r\n  ---------------------------------+-----------+---------+------------\r\n\r\nSir Andrew Halliday, aware that these numbers bore no proportion to the\r\nactual number of insane and idiots in Ireland, reckoned the number at\r\nthree thousand.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 the Richmond Asylum, Dublin, was converted into a District\r\nLunatic Asylum for the city of Dublin by the Act 11 Geo. IV., c.\r\n22.[264]\r\n\r\nPassing on to 1842, the Solicitor-General for Ireland in that year\r\nintroduced a \"Bill for amending the Law relating to Private Lunatic\r\nAsylums in Ireland,\" which became law August 12, 1842. It is not\r\nnecessary, however, to give its details in this place, and I shall\r\nproceed to notice the important Report of the Committee of the House of\r\nLords, with minutes of evidence, which was issued in 1843.[265] A table\r\nis given of the district asylums and the Cork Asylum, from which it\r\nappears that at that period the number amounted to ten, viz. Armagh,\r\nBelfast, Carlow, Clonmel, Connaught, Limerick, Londonderry, Maryborough,\r\nRichmond, and Waterford.\r\n\r\nThese ten district asylums contained upwards of 2000 patients, although\r\nbuilt to contain only 1220. As 688 were found to be incurable, the\r\nCommittee reiterated the warning given at the Committee of 1817, that if\r\nfresh provision were not made, the institutions would shortly become\r\n\"asylums for mad people, and not hospitals for the cure of insanity.\" As\r\nto the treatment, it is reported that \"the system of management adopted\r\nin the district asylums appears to have been, with the exception of one\r\ncase of gross misconduct and abuse, very satisfactory.... A humane and\r\ngentle system of treatment has been generally adopted, the cases\r\nrequiring restraint and coercion not exceeding two per cent. on the\r\nwhole. The system is one which, if applied exclusively to the cure of\r\nthe malady, and if the asylums were relieved from the pressure produced\r\nby the increasing number of incurables, appears to the Committee in its\r\nessential points to be deserving of confidence and of approval; but,\r\nunless so relieved by some alteration of the present law and of the\r\npresent practice, the admission of new cases must necessarily be\r\nlimited, and may ultimately be restricted within very narrow bounds\r\nindeed. The necessity of some change in this respect is admitted by all\r\nthe witnesses, as well as proved by the documentary evidence before the\r\nCommittee. The number of persons refused admission for want of room has\r\nin the present year amounted to one hundred and fifty-two.\"\r\n\r\nAt this period, beside the district asylums, there were Swift's\r\nHospital, and other establishments provided for the custody of pauper\r\nlunatics, supported by local taxation, and connected more or less with\r\nthe old houses of industry. At Kilkenny, Lifford, Limerick, Island\r\nBridge, and in Dublin (the House of Industry) local asylums existed,\r\ncharacterized as \"miserable and most inadequate places of confinement,\"\r\nand were under the authority of the grand juries, the funds being raised\r\nby presentment or county rate. \"The description given of these latter\r\nmost wretched establishments not only proves the necessity of\r\ndiscontinuing them as speedily as accommodation of a different kind can\r\nbe provided, but also exemplifies the utter hopelessness, or rather the\r\ntotal impossibility, of providing for the due treatment of insanity in\r\nsmall local asylums. No adequate provision is made, or is likely to be\r\nmade in such establishments, for the medical or moral treatment of the\r\nunfortunate patients. Hence the necessity of a coercive and severe\r\nsystem of treatment. The chances of recovery, if not altogether\r\nextinguished, are at least reduced to their very lowest term.... Whilst\r\na general improvement has taken place in the management of the insane\r\nthroughout other establishments of Ireland, these local asylums, if\r\nindeed they deserve such a name, have continued in the most wretched\r\nstate.\" Evidence of the strongest kind is given to impress upon\r\nParliament the necessity of an immediate discontinuance of this part of\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\nIt would carry us too far to enter at length into this evidence. One or\r\ntwo facts must suffice as examples of the rest. At Wexford, where, in\r\nthe cells for lunatics, there were two patients in restraint, one of\r\nwhom was chained to a wall, Dr. White, the Inspector of Prisons, thus\r\ndescribed the latter: \"When I went to his cell with the keeper and the\r\nmedical officer, I asked to go in. He was naked, with a parcel of loose\r\nstraw about him. He darted forward at me, and were it not that he was\r\nchecked by a chain round his leg, and was fastened by a hook to the\r\nwall, he would have caught hold of me, and probably used violence. I\r\nasked how it was possible they could allow a man to remain in such a\r\nstate; they said they were obliged to do so, as the funds were so\r\nlimited that they had not money to buy clothes for him, and that if they\r\nhad clothes they would have let him out.... I went to another cell, and\r\nthough the individual was not chained, he was nearly in as bad\r\ncircumstances as the other. Altogether these two cases were the most\r\nfrightful I ever witnessed. I could not describe the horror which seized\r\nme when I saw them. I went into a room, a very gloomy-looking room, very\r\nlow, and in this room there was a fireplace, which was guarded by one of\r\nthose large grate-protectors that are very high up; I looked around and\r\nheard some one moaning, and on the top of this screen I saw two\r\nunfortunate lunatics stretched out; they were trying to warm themselves\r\nthrough the bars of the grating; the room was so dark that I could not\r\nsee them at first, and here they were allowed to creep about and to lie\r\nin this kind of unprotected manner.\" In reply to the question, \"Was\r\nthere any moral superintendence?\" Dr. White said, \"There was both a male\r\nand female keeper, but they appeared to me totally unfit for the\r\ndischarge of their duties.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of lunatics confined in jails was found by the inquiry of\r\n1843 to have increased, partly in consequence of the Act 1 and 2 Vict.,\r\nc. 27, for the more effectual provision for the prevention of offences\r\nby insane persons. Two justices were authorized, acting with the advice\r\nof a medical man, to commit to jail any person apprehended under\r\ncircumstances denoting derangement of mind and a purpose of committing\r\ncrime. A subsequent clause authorized the Lord Lieutenant to transfer\r\nsuch person, as well as convicts, to a lunatic asylum. No steps had been\r\ntaken to ascertain whether, on the one hand, the jails afforded any\r\naccommodation whatever for such lunatics, or whether, on the other,\r\nconvict lunatics could be properly received into the district asylums.\r\nThe statute operated widely. Previous to it, in 1837, there had been\r\nonly thirty-seven lunatics in jails, while by the year 1840 they had\r\naugmented to one hundred and ten, of whom eighty-one were maniacs,\r\nseventeen were idiots, and twelve were epileptics; while by the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1843, the number amounted to two hundred and fourteen. Of these\r\nonly forty had been convicted of any criminal offence, showing that the\r\napplication of the Act had gone much beyond the intention of its\r\nframers. Thus it was that \"the numbers crowding the county jails were\r\ntruly distressing, and were made the subject of universal complaint by\r\nthe local authorities.\"[266]\r\n\r\nThe Lords' Committee, of course, insisted on the necessity of\r\ndiscontinuing the committal of lunatics to jails and bridewells, and\r\namending the Act 1 Vict., c. 27, which had led to such serious abuses;\r\nthe inexpediency of appropriating the union workhouses or houses of\r\nindustry to the custody or treatment of the insane; the necessity of\r\nproviding one central establishment for criminal lunatics, under the\r\nimmediate control and direction of the Government of Ireland, to be\r\nsupported from the same funds and under the system adopted in respect\r\nto criminal lunatics in England; the necessity of increasing the\r\naccommodation for pauper lunatics in Ireland, and of providing for the\r\ncases of epilepsy, idiocy, and chronic disease by an increased number of\r\nthe district asylums, by enlargement of these asylums, or by the\r\nerection of separate establishments, specially appropriated for these\r\nclasses of patients.[267]\r\n\r\nAt this Committee Dr. Conolly gave the results of his non-restraint\r\nexperience at Hanwell since September, 1839.\r\n\r\nThe following tabular statement, delivered in at the Committee by the\r\nRev. E. M. Clarke, presents a valuable picture of the state of lunacy in\r\nIreland on the 1st of January, 1843:--\r\n\r\n   1. Population of Ireland in 1841                  8,175,238\r\n   2.

Number confined in workhouses, March 31,\r\n        1843                                               557\r\n  11.

Number of curable cases in district\r\n        asylums, January 1, 1843                           698\r\n  13. Number of incurable cases in district\r\n       asylums, January 1, 1843                          1,368\r\n\r\nA correspondence took place between the Irish Government and the\r\nmanagers of the district asylums on the subject of the Report of the\r\nHouse of Lords' Committee on the state of the lunatic poor, commencing\r\nNovember, 1843, by a letter from Lord Elliott to the superintendents,\r\nasking for their opinion. These unanimously endorsed the conclusions\r\narrived at by the Committee, and, in some instances entering into the\r\nmode of inspection of asylums by the two inspectors-general of prisons\r\nat their half-yearly visitation of gaols, asserted that \"it must from a\r\nvariety of causes be of no use whatever.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irish Government also opened a correspondence in 1844 with the grand\r\njuries of each county, and their opinion was asked as to the eligibility\r\nof the sites proposed for new asylums. As the Acts of Parliament limited\r\nthe number of patients in any single asylum, it was sought to remove\r\nthis obstacle by an Act in 1845, 8 and 9 Vict., c. 107. This Act also\r\nprovided for the erection of a central asylum for criminal lunatics,\r\nwhich carried out one important recommendation of the Lords' Committee.\r\nThe Cork Asylum was at the same time added to the district asylums.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 an Act (9 and 10 Vict., c. 115) was passed to amend the laws as\r\nto district asylums in Ireland, and to provide for the expenses of\r\ninspection of asylums.\r\n\r\nFrom a return made in this year (1846) showing the total number of\r\nlunatics in the district, local, and private asylums and jails on the\r\n1st of January during each of the previous ten years, I observe that in\r\n1837 there was a total of 3077, and in 1846 a total of 3658, thus\r\ndistributed:--\r\n\r\n  ------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n   Year.|  District |   Local   |  Private  |  Jails.  |  Total.\r\n        |  Asylums. |  Asylums. |  Asylums. |          |\r\n  ------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n  1837  |     1610  |     1236  |      152  |       79 |     3077\r\n  1846  |     2555  |      562  |      251  |      290 |     3658\r\n        +-----------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n        | Inc. 945  | Dec. 674  |  Inc. 99  | Inc. 211 | Inc. 581\r\n  ------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nOf the 3658, as many as 2473 were incurable, leaving only 1185 curable\r\npatients. For 1846 there is also a return of the number in poor-houses,\r\n1921; wandering idiots and simpletons, 6217; lunatics under the care of\r\nCourt of Chancery not in asylums, 76; making a total of 11,872, of whom\r\n327 only were private patients.\r\n\r\nIn the following year the annual report of the Inspectors thus speaks of\r\nnon-restraint: \"The non-restraint system has been introduced, and is\r\ngenerally acted on, mechanical restraint being seldom applied except\r\nwhere the patients are very violent, and even then it is not often\r\nresorted to, as a temporary seclusion is now substituted as a more\r\neffectual means of tranquillizing the patients without the risk of\r\npersonal injury often resulting from the application of bodily\r\nrestraint, and arrangements are being made to have apartments fitted up\r\nfor this purpose in each asylum.\"\r\n\r\nThe percentage of cures and mortality during the previous seven years\r\nwas as follows:--Per cent. on the admissions, 38.65; mortality\r\ncalculated on average number resident, 8.39--not an unsatisfactory\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nIn 1849 the proportion of lunatics (_i.e._ ascertained) to the\r\npopulation in Ireland was 1 to 900, while in Scotland it was 1 to 740,\r\nand in England 1 to 870.\r\n\r\nIn their report of this year, the Inspectors of Asylums express their\r\nregret that no provision exists for the insane who, not being paupers,\r\nare legally inadmissible into the public institutions, and are unable to\r\nmeet the charges made in private asylums, the only mixed institutions\r\nbeing St. Patrick's Hospital and the Retreat in Dublin, managed by the\r\nSociety of Friends.\r\n\r\nThe number of patients in the district asylums in 1851 (exclusive of\r\nCork, 394) was as follows:--\r\n\r\n                    No.    Opened.\r\n  Armagh            131     1824\r\n  Belfast           269     1829\r\n  Carlow            197     1832\r\n  Clonmel           197     1834\r\n  Ballinasloe       312     1833\r\n  Limerick          340     1827\r\n  Londonderry       223     1829\r\n  Maryborough       192     1833\r\n  Richmond          279     1815\r\n  Waterford         115     1835\r\n                   ----\r\n            Total  2255\r\n\r\nIn 1855[268] the Act 18 and 19 Vict., c. 76, continued the Private\r\nAsylum Act of 5 and 6 Vict. The 9 and 10 Vict., c. 79, and 14 and 15\r\nVict., c. 46, were continued till 1860. The Act 18 and 19 Vict., c.\r\n109, made further provisions for the repayment of advances out of the\r\nconsolidated fund for the erection and enlargement of asylums for the\r\nlunatic poor in Ireland. Seven asylums had been built under the Board of\r\nWorks since 1847.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important attempt to take steps for the reform of Irish\r\nlunacy was the appointment of a Royal Commission in 1856, to inquire\r\ninto the state of lunatic asylums and other institutions for the custody\r\nand treatment of the insane in Ireland. Among the Commissioners of\r\nInquiry were Mr. Lutwidge, Mr. Wilkes, and Dr. Corrigan. The Report was\r\nissued in 1858. They found that on January 1, 1857, the total number of\r\npatients in asylum districts amounted to 5225, of whom 1707 were in\r\nworkhouses, 166 in jails, and 3352 at large, while the inmates of\r\ndistrict asylums numbered only 3824. They therefore urged the pressing\r\nneed of additional accommodation. They proposed that the Irish law\r\nshould be assimilated, with respect to single patients, to the 16 and 17\r\nVict., c. 97, s. 68, the police being empowered to bring before a\r\nmagistrate any wandering lunatic, and justices of the peace having power\r\non sworn information to cause such person to be brought before them.\r\nThey also regarded as absolutely necessary a total alteration of the\r\nrules affecting the manager and physician of an asylum, previous rules\r\nhaving been drawn up in contemplation of the former officer not being a\r\nmedical man. Among other recommendations, there were proposals in\r\nreference to private asylums, for which no legislative enactment was\r\npassed prior to 1826 (7 Geo. IV., c. 74),[269] and no special law for\r\nlicensing them or securing their proper management until 1842, when the\r\nstatute of 5 and 6 Vict., c. 123, enacted that the Inspectors-General of\r\nPrisons, whose duty it was to inspect private asylums, should be\r\nInspectors of Lunatic Asylums--a function which, with others connected\r\nwith asylums, was by the 8 and 9 Vict., c. 107, transferred to the then\r\nnewly appointed Inspectors of Lunatics. The Commission proposed that the\r\npower of issuing licences should be transferred from the justices to the\r\nInspectors of Lunatics; that the licence should require that some\r\nmedical man should reside on the premises; that any abuse, ill\r\ntreatment, or wilful neglect of a lunatic by the superintendent or any\r\nother person employed in the care of lunatics, should be deemed a\r\nmisdemeanour, and punished accordingly; and that, for inspection,\r\nlicensed houses should be visited by one or more of the Commissioners\r\nfour times a year. Many other important recommendations were made by the\r\nCommission, some of which bore fruit in subsequent Irish legislation,\r\nbut to how limited an extent is evident from the recommendations of\r\nanother Commission, to which we shall shortly refer.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners notice the culpable disregard with which the rule of\r\nthe Privy Council, which requires that \"the manager is to take charge of\r\nthe instruments of restraint, and is not, under any pretence, to allow\r\nthe unauthorized use of them to any person within the establishment; all\r\ncases placed under restraint, seclusion, or other deviation from the\r\nordinary treatment, being carefully recorded by him in the daily report,\r\nwith the particular nature of the restraint or deviation resorted to,\"\r\nhas in many instances been treated. So also had the rule that the\r\nsuperintendent was to enter in the Morning Statement Book \"the names of\r\nthose in restraint or seclusion, and the causes thereof.\" Some managers\r\nwere not aware of the existence of the rule, while others deemed it a\r\nsufficient compliance with the rules to leave the instruments of\r\nrestraint in charge of the keepers, trusting to their integrity to\r\nreport the cases in which they were used. In one asylum a female patient\r\nwas strapped down in bed with body-straps of hard leather, three inches\r\nwide, and twisted under the body, with wrist-locks, strapped and locked,\r\nand with wrists frayed from want of lining to straps, and was seriously\r\nill, but yet no record had been made in the book. \"Wrist-locks and\r\nbody-straps were hung up in the day-room, for application at the\r\nattendants' pleasure. A male patient was strapped down in bed; in\r\naddition, he was confined in a strait waistcoat with the sleeves knotted\r\nbehind him; and as he could only lie on his back, his sufferings must\r\nhave been great; his arms were, moreover, confined with wrist-locks of\r\nhard leather, and his legs with leg-locks of similar kind; the strapping\r\nwas so tight that he could not turn on either side; and any change of\r\nposition was still more effectually prevented by a cylindrical stuffed\r\nbolster of ticken, of about ten inches thick, which ran round the sides,\r\nand top, and bottom of the bed, leaving a narrow hollow, in the centre\r\nof which the lunatic was retained, as in a box, without power to turn\r\nor move. On liberating the patient and raising him, he was very feeble,\r\nunable to stand, with pulse scarcely perceptible, and feet dark red and\r\ncold; the man had been under confinement in this state for four days and\r\nnights;\" yet the manager stated he was not aware of his having all these\r\ninstruments of restraint upon him, and no record of the case appeared in\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\nAt another asylum the Commissioners found a bed in use for refractory\r\npatients, in which there was an iron cover which went over both rails,\r\nsufficiently high to allow a patient to turn and twist, but not to get\r\nup.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Report of the Commissioners of 1858, we may add that,\r\nduring the period comprised between the date of the Committee of 1843\r\nand this Commission, the number of district asylums was increased from\r\nten to sixteen, affording additional room for 1760 patients, exclusive\r\nof Dundrum and a large addition to the Richmond Asylum.

But, in addition to the removal of incurable\r\ncases to workhouses, the Commissioners recommended additional buildings\r\nin connection with existing asylums, for the reception of cases which,\r\nalthough incurable, might yet, from their habits or dangerous tendency,\r\nbe considered improper cases to be removed from institutions especially\r\ndevoted to the treatment of insanity. They were satisfied that the\r\nnumber of district asylums would be found more and more inadequate for\r\nthe wants of the country.\r\n\r\nThere was a Select Committee of the House of Commons on lunatics in\r\n1859.[270] In the minutes of evidence great stress is laid upon the\r\nnecessity of providing, in Irish asylums, accommodation for the class\r\nimmediately above paupers, whose friends were willing to pay a small\r\nadditional sum for their maintenance; and also establishing district\r\nasylums, similar to the chartered asylums in Scotland. Two years later\r\n(1861), and three after the Royal Commission, the Act 24 and 25 Vict.,\r\nc. 57, continued the various Acts respecting private and public asylums\r\n(5 and 6 Vict., c. 123; 18 and 19 Vict., c. 76). The subsequent Act of\r\n1867 (30 and 31 Vict., c. 118) provided for the appointment of the\r\nofficers of district asylums, and amended the law relating to the\r\ncustody of dangerous lunatics and idiots. These were not to be sent to\r\nany jail in the land after January 1, 1868. Dangerous lunatics\r\npreviously had to pass through jails, instead of going direct to\r\nasylums. The 31 and 32 Vict., c. 97, made provision for the audit of\r\naccounts of district asylums, and is of no general interest.\r\n\r\nDuring three years (1866-69) six additional asylums were erected,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n  -------------+------------------------------------------\r\n               |            When first opened.\r\n     Name of   +-------+----------------------+-----------\r\n     asylum.   |       |                      | Number of\r\n               | Date. | Cost including site. |   beds.\r\n  -------------+-------+----------------------+-----------\r\n               |       |     L      s.    d.  |\r\n  Ennis        | 1868  |  51,316     8     6  |   260\r\n  Letterkenny  | 1866  |  37,887     5     3  |   300\r\n  Downpatrick  | 1869  |  60,377     6     5  |   300\r\n  Castlebar    | 1866  |  34,903    14    11  |   250\r\n  Monaghan     | 1869  |  57,662     5     5  |   340\r\n  Enniscorthy  | 1868  |  50,008     0     6  |   288\r\n               +-------+----------------------+-----------\r\n        Total            292,155     1     0  |  1738\r\n  --------------------------------------------+-----------\r\n\r\nReturning to 1861, the tenth report of the Inspectors of Asylums, issued\r\nin that year, gives much important information on the state of lunacy in\r\nIreland at that time, but there are only two points to which it is\r\nnecessary to refer here. The writers, Drs. Nugent and Hatchell, speak\r\nindignantly of the shameful manner in which the friends of lunatics in\r\nconfinement neglect them, \"as if their malady entailed a disgrace on\r\nthose connected with them ... months--nay, years--passing without an\r\ninquiry being made by a brother for a brother, or a child for a parent.\"\r\n\r\nAfter stating that during the previous ten years four new asylums had\r\nbeen licensed, the Inspectors recur to the importance of supplying\r\nasylums for patients who, unable to pay the ordinary charge of a private\r\nasylum, not being paupers, are ineligible for admission into public\r\nasylums.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 a new code of rules, issued by the Privy Council, contained many\r\nimportant regulations. Of it, however, the late Dr. Robert Stewart[271]\r\nobserved, \"On the whole, we cannot speak very highly of the tact or\r\nwisdom shown by the Lord Lieutenant and Privy Council in the framing of\r\nthe new code of regulations.\"[272] In this code the duties of the\r\nmedical superintendents of Irish asylums are minutely laid down.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 a Lunacy Inquiry Commission was appointed by the Lord Lieutenant\r\nof Ireland, the Report of which in the following year, after an\r\nexamination of a large number of witnesses, contains much valuable\r\ninformation as to various questions connected with the asylums and the\r\nprovision for the insane poor, present and future. The following \"most\r\ndistressing case,\" recorded by the Commission, speaks loudly of the need\r\nof increased provision for the insane poor in Ireland:--\r\n\r\n\"On approaching a small farmhouse at a place called ----, I heard,\" says\r\nDr. Robertson, \"a most peculiar howling noise, and, to my horror, when I\r\ncame near the house I saw a lunatic _stark naked_, confined to a room,\r\nand looking through the wooden bars that closed the windows, for there\r\nwas no glass whatever. He is about nineteen years of age, and I heard\r\nfrom his mother that up to ten or eleven years he was a most intelligent\r\nboy; but at that age he suddenly lost the power of speech and became\r\nmoody and abstracted, wandering about the fields alone, and constantly\r\nuttering a low, muttering noise, and with incessant tendency to\r\nmischief. By careful watching, the family prevented him injuring himself\r\nand others, until of late he has got so strong and unmanageable, and his\r\ninclination for destruction is so great, that they have been obliged to\r\nconfine him in the room I have described. He breaks the window directly\r\nit is glazed, tears his bed-clothes into shreds, and won't allow a\r\nstitch of clothing to remain on his body; besides, his habits are most\r\ndisgusting.\"[273] The incumbent of the parish wrote: \"This case is\r\nindeed only suited for a lunatic asylum. The form which his lunacy has\r\nassumed is most shocking, and is detrimental to morality.\" An English\r\ntourist happening to see this case had him removed to the Monaghan\r\nAsylum. One cannot but remark that what an English tourist did, the\r\nproper authorities ought to have done. The law appears to have been\r\nsufficient for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Commission were not content with hearsay evidence.\r\n\"We took occasion ourselves,\" they report, \"to visit several of these\r\ncases in different parts of the country. Some of them we found in a\r\ndeplorably neglected condition; others disturbing the arrangements of a\r\nwhole family, the head of which would willingly contribute a small sum\r\ntowards maintenance in some suitable place of refuge. It admits of no\r\ndoubt that many a case, if taken in hand at an early stage, might have\r\nbeen restored to society, instead of lapsing into hopeless, incurable\r\ninsanity. Serious evil often results from the freedom with which idiots\r\nof both sexes are permitted to wander abroad, often teased and goaded to\r\nfrenzy by thoughtless children, often the victims of ill treatment or\r\nthe perpetrators of offences far worse. The interests of the public, no\r\nless than of the insane, require that means should be adopted to\r\nascertain that all of that class are properly cared for. That can only\r\nbe done by substituting the visit of a medical man for that of the\r\nconstable, and a professional report for the incomplete return that is\r\nnow made.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief conclusions were, that while it would not be proper to\r\ndispense wholly with any workhouse, portions of some might be dispensed\r\nwith for sane paupers, and appropriated for the accommodation of a\r\ncertain class of the insane. Over-crowding, it was proposed, should be\r\nrelieved by the removal of lunatics to _auxiliary asylums_. School\r\nbuildings belonging to certain workhouses were suggested as auxiliary\r\nasylums, as in Dublin, Cork, etc. For the better cure, relief, and\r\ntreatment of the lunatic and idiotic poor, a complete reorganization of\r\nthe whole lunacy administration was regarded as essential, viz. that\r\nunder the provisions of s. 15 of 8 and 9 Vict., c. 107, the existing\r\ndistrict asylums should be classified, reserving one or more, as might\r\nbe required, in each province as \"lunatic hospitals,\" especially for\r\nthe curative treatment of the insane; that the remaining district\r\nasylums should be appropriated as \"lunatic asylums\" for the\r\naccommodation of the chronic insane requiring special care, a certain\r\nnumber of this class being accommodated in the \"lunatic hospitals,\" as\r\nabout fifty of each sex would be required for the service of those\r\nestablishments; that the inspection of the \"lunatics at large\" should be\r\nmade one of the duties of the dispensary medical officers, who should be\r\nremunerated for this duty, and whose certificate that any one of this\r\nclass is neglected or improperly cared for, should be made the ground\r\nfor action by the lunacy authorities; that the accommodation for the\r\nthird or harmless class, who are at present in lunatic asylums, in\r\nworkhouses, or at large in a neglected state, be provided by the\r\nappropriation of spare workhouse buildings, a sufficiency of which is to\r\nbe found in each province, thus also meeting the very general complaint\r\nof guardians being compelled to maintain superfluous workhouse\r\naccommodation; and that all expenditure upon the building or enlargement\r\nof district asylums should be suspended.\r\n\r\nBy this means, each province would be provided with _three_ classes of\r\nlunatic establishments: (1) One or more lunatic hospitals for the cure\r\nof insanity in an early stage; (2) first-class asylums, in which the\r\nchronic cases requiring special care would be treated; (3) second-class\r\nor \"workhouse auxiliary asylums\" for harmless lunatics. The Commission\r\nexpressed a strong opinion that the whole lunacy administration of\r\nIreland should be placed under the general control of the Local\r\nGovernment Board.\r\n\r\nI may add that the estimated cost of the first class was L26 per head;\r\nthat of the second class, L20; and that of the third, L14 6s. Of this\r\nscheme it must be said that, excellent as it is in intention, it is not\r\nin some of its provisions without danger in the direction of lowering\r\nthe condition of the insane poor, as regards comfort and medical\r\nsupervision, not, indeed, below what they are in some Irish workhouses,\r\nbut below the standard aimed at in the best county asylums. \"Let it be\r\nunderstood that there is no recommendation to constitute anything like\r\nan auxiliary asylum, such as Leavesden or Caterham, where large numbers,\r\nbeing brought together, can be kept at a cheap rate, and can at the same\r\ntime be properly treated under medical care. No provision is made for\r\nthe necessary supervision, medical or otherwise. The dispensing medical\r\nofficer is to visit the insane at large, but those in workhouses are to\r\nbe left to the tender mercies of attendants. The amount of care and\r\ncomfort these unfortunate beings are to enjoy can be imagined by the\r\nfact that the Commission considers that L14 6s. a year will be the cost\r\nof their maintenance, after paying attendants, whilst the cost of those\r\nin the second-class establishments is to be L20, or about L6 less than\r\nwhat they cost at present.\"[274]\r\n\r\nIn their review of the results of past lunacy legislation in Ireland the\r\nCommission make the melancholy statement that \"although several years\r\nago the legislature made provision for the classification of\r\nasylums,[275] and the Inspectors of Lunacy concur with other witnesses\r\nof the highest authority in thinking that such classification would be\r\nattended with the utmost advantage--would, in fact, meet the\r\ndifficulties of asylum administration--yet not only has no attempt ever\r\nbeen made to give effect to the provisions of that law, but\"--strangest\r\nof all--\"the Lunacy Inspectors appear to have been unaware of its\r\nexistence!\"[276]\r\n\r\nThe Commission found that the evil of overcrowding with incurable cases,\r\ncomplained of by the Committee of 1843, and by the Royal Commission of\r\n1858, \"has continued to the present day not merely unchecked, but in a\r\nmore aggravated form than ever.\" In 1856 there were 1168 curable and\r\n2656 incurable patients in Irish asylums, while in 1877 these numbers\r\nwere, respectively, 1911 and 6272, the percentages being in the former\r\nyear, curable 30.5, incurable 69.5, while in the latter year the\r\ncorresponding percentages were 23.3 and 76.7. Taking the patients not\r\nonly in asylums, but in workhouses also, the total in 1856 (or more\r\ncorrectly 1857) was as follows: curable, 1187; incurable, 4468;\r\npercentages, 20.9 and 79.1. In 1877, curable, 1911; incurable, 9644;\r\npercentages, 16.5 and 83.4--a frightful revelation of incurable lunacy.\r\nThe Inspectors complain that the Act 30 and 31 Vict. has caused this\r\nincrease of unsuitable cases,[277] but, as the Commission observe, it\r\nhas simply increased an existing evil, and not produced a new one.\r\nBesides, \"how otherwise are these unhappy people to be dealt with? Has\r\nany other accommodation been provided for them? Though not suitable\r\ncases for curative hospitals, they are, at all events, suitable cases\r\nfor care and humane treatment, and not until provision for such\r\ntreatment is made, ought the door of the asylum to be shut against\r\nthem.\"[278]\r\n\r\nThe condition of workhouses is proved by this Report to be most\r\nunsuitable for the reception of the insane; yet they contained in 1879\r\none quarter of the pauper lunatics of the country. It was desirable to\r\nremove a large number of these somewhere, and the only suitable place\r\nwas the district asylum. Dr. Lalor, in his evidence before this\r\nCommission, says in regard to this increased number of admissions under\r\nthe 30 and 31 Vict., \"I think it is an immense advantage, because before\r\nthat Act there was a great number of persons kept out who ought to be\r\nsent into lunatic asylums, but there was not sufficient machinery for\r\ndoing so.\" Dr. Lalor then goes on to say that they have not in Ireland\r\nthe same provision as in England for taking up merely wandering lunatics\r\nnot chargeable to the rates. This witness, I should add, is strongly in\r\nfavour of larger asylums for even curable cases, and would classify the\r\ninstitutions for the insane into three classes, the curable, the\r\nimprovable, and the incurable. For curable and improvable cases of\r\nlunacy, including those requiring special care, and for the training and\r\neducation of imbeciles and idiots chiefly of the juvenile classes, he\r\nwould have the same asylum; for the incurable and unimprovable, he would\r\nhave another. He would leave it to a central body to distinguish the\r\ncases, and would allow that such a body might find it more convenient to\r\nclass the juvenile idiots and imbeciles under the second division.\r\n\r\nAt the date of this Commission there were 22 district asylums,\r\ncontaining 8073 patients. There were 150 workhouses, with 3200 insane\r\ninmates. In Dundrum[279] were 166 criminal insane, and in private\r\nasylums about 680 patients, making a total of 12,200. In addition to\r\nthese, the inspectors obtain a return of every idiot, imbecile and\r\nepileptic, at large, from the police, not being under the supervision of\r\nthe Lunacy Board; the number in 1878 was 6200, bringing up the figures\r\nto 18,400.\r\n\r\nThat practical effect might be given to the recommendations contained in\r\nthis Report, Lord O'Hagan called attention to them in a speech delivered\r\nin the House of Lords, August, 1879, in which he said, \"Let me ask the\r\nattention of the House to the case of neglected lunatics in Ireland. It\r\nis the most pressing, as it is the most deplorable.\" He cited the\r\nstatement of the Royal Commission of 1858, that there were 3352 lunatics\r\nat large, of whom no fewer than 1583 were returned as \"neglected;\" and\r\nthe recent statement of the Irish Lunatic Inquiry Commission that within\r\nthe last twenty years the number of that class had increased by more\r\nthan a hundred per cent.--from 3352 to 6709--without \"any diminution in\r\nthe proportion of those who may still be classified as neglected.\" Lord\r\nO'Hagan referred to the case of a naked lunatic in a farmhouse, which we\r\nhave quoted at p. 424, and maintained that some four thousand lunatics\r\nwere in a condition \"better or worse according to circumstances.\" We\r\ncannot but think that the speaker generalized a little too much. He was\r\nright, however, in his contention that none of the neglected cases \"are\r\nprotected by any intervention of the law from exhibiting themselves in\r\nas shocking an aspect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only,\" observed Lord O'Hagan, \"when the life of George III. was\r\nthreatened by a lunatic in England, did Parliament interfere and send\r\nthe insane to jails; only in 1838, when it was discovered that jails\r\nwere not fit receptacles for them, was provision made for committing\r\nthem to asylums; and only in the Consolidating Act of 1853 were\r\nprovisions made for such inspection and report as were needful for their\r\nprotection and the safety of their neighbours. I lament to say that\r\nIreland was left without even the benefit of the Act of 1799 until 1838,\r\nand that the advantages which the Act of that year gave to England were\r\nnot extended to her lunatics until 1867; whilst you will scarcely\r\nbelieve that the salutary reforms of 1853 have not to this hour been\r\nmade operative in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\nLord O'Hagan asked for identical legislation for Ireland and England,\r\nthe want of this having caused \"incalculable mischief.\"\r\n\r\nAfter observing that the Commission proposed the classification of\r\nasylums for the purpose of curative treatment, the care of chronic\r\ncases, and the allocation of workhouses as auxiliaries for the benefit\r\nof the quiet and harmless, Lord O'Hagan referred to the fact that \"the\r\nCommission and the Inspectors of Lunacy differed as to material points\r\non the _modus operandi_, the inspectors desiring the extension of\r\ndistrict asylums, and the Commission not agreeing with this view; the\r\nconsequence being that at that time their extension was suspended.\" The\r\nspeaker did not presume to decide between them, but simply called upon\r\nthe Government to recognize the responsibility which the Report of the\r\nCommission had cast upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor (Lord Cairns) replied that the Report was engaging\r\nthe attention of the Government; that he trusted it would not be in the\r\ncategory of those Reports \"which have gone before\" and produced no\r\nresult; but that he could not give any further answer.[280]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor of Ireland (Lord O'Hagan) brought in on the 20th of\r\nJanuary, 1880, the \"County Court Jurisdiction in Lunacy Bill\r\n(Ireland),\"[281] which not only passed the House of Lords, but was read\r\na third time in the House of Commons, August 17th of that year.[282]\r\n\r\nLord O'Hagan's measure had for its object to protect the interests of\r\nlunatics possessed of small properties, beyond the control of Chancery\r\non account of the expense incurred thereby. There were in Ireland under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor, committed to him by the Queen's\r\nsign manual, 229. By the operation of the Act of 1871, introduced by\r\nLord O'Hagan, the guardianship then provided had worked admirably. But\r\nthere remained those who had very small property. Of the 642 persons\r\nthen in private asylums, 143 only were under the guardianship of the\r\nLord Chancellor, and the remainder might be presumed to have small\r\nproperties. In the district asylums there were 55 paying patients, 20 of\r\nwhom were under the Court of Chancery. Those on whose behalf Lord\r\nO'Hagan addressed the House of Lords were estimated at 724. The property\r\nof most of these \"was left to the mercy of relations or strangers, who\r\ndid with these unhappy people what they would.\" While in the previous\r\nyear 1276 patients had been sent to district, and 141 to private\r\nasylums, only 24 had been brought within the protection of the Lord\r\nChancellor. As much as L3189 was received from patients in the district\r\nasylums in a year. The Bill now introduced gave protection to the class\r\nin question by vesting in the County Court judges a new jurisdiction,\r\nviz. in lunacy within the areas of the various courts, in cases in which\r\nthe property of the lunatic should not exceed the sum of L700 in money\r\nvalue, or L50 a year--sums taken from the Lunacy Regulation Act of 1871,\r\nwhich provided that the Lord Chancellor might be at liberty not to\r\nimpose upon lunatics having property of that value, the same fees and\r\nobligations that were insisted upon in the case of more wealthy persons.\r\nLord O'Hagan regarded his Bill as only part of a larger measure to which\r\nhe looked forward.[283]\r\n\r\nA Bill was introduced into the House of Commons, but without passing\r\ninto an Act, by Mr. Litton, member for Tyrone, entitled \"The Lunacy Law\r\nAssimilation (Ireland) Bill,\" on the 6th of April, 1881,[284] and it may\r\nbe worth while to observe what, according to so comparatively recent a\r\nspeaker on the subject, is now wanted to improve the condition of Irish\r\nlunatics. After pointing out that, according to the Report of the\r\nCommission of 1879, there were on January 1, 1878, about 11,000 lunatics\r\nprovided for, the number at large, inadequately cared for, was 6709, of\r\nwhom more than 3000 were actually neglected, as against 1583 in the year\r\n1857; and after reviewing the legislation of 1 and 2 Geo. IV., by which\r\ndistrict asylums were established; the 1 and 2 Vict., c. 47, by which\r\ndangerous lunatics may be committed to jails; the 8 and 9 Vict., by\r\nwhich they might be transferred to Dundrum; the 30 and 31 Vict., c. 118\r\n(1867), by which the first provision for sending this class of lunatics\r\nto jail was repealed; the 38 and 39 Vict. c. 67 (1875), by which it was\r\nprovided that chronic lunatics not being dangerous might be consigned to\r\nthe poor-houses--Mr. Litton showed that there was no attempt at\r\nclassification in poor-houses, and that they only accommodated 3365\r\npersons, and further that, in spite of the last Act, the asylums were\r\ncrowded with chronic and incurable cases, and had but little room for\r\nrecent cases. He deplored the want of supervision of the neglected\r\nlunatics referred to, many of whom were subjected to cruel treatment. He\r\ntherefore preferred to extend to Ireland the provisions of ss. 66 to 68,\r\n70 to 72, and 78 to 81 of the English Act, 16 and 17 Vict., c. 97,\r\nsubject to certain changes which were explained in the Bill. He doubted\r\nwhether powers to enlarge the existing asylums would meet the\r\ndifficulty, and it would be very costly and lengthy. It was proposed to\r\nadopt the system of boarding out which had been in operation in\r\nScotland; due provision was made for their inspection. It was also\r\nneedful to give to poor-law guardians power to afford relief to the head\r\nof a family one of whose members was insane (as in England), which was\r\nnow impossible, unless the head of the family was so afflicted.\r\n\r\nThe fact that all committals of dangerous lunatics on the warrant of two\r\nmagistrates must be cases in which the latter are satisfied that a\r\nlunatic had shown an intent to commit an indictable crime leads, it is\r\nstated, to many persons who, although dangerous, have not shown the\r\nabove intent, being kept out of asylums until they have passed into a\r\nchronic state. However this may be, the number committed in Ireland as\r\ndangerous lunatics is enormous, being in one year (1877) 1204 out of\r\n1343 admissions, the truth being that numbers are classified as\r\ndangerous who are not so.\r\n\r\nMr. Litton's Bill provided (1) for the supervision of neglected\r\nlunatics; (2) the boarding out in suitable places, under the direction\r\nof the governors of district asylums, of such patients as they might\r\nselect for that purpose; (3) an alteration in the law of committal, so\r\nas to allow of patients being admitted before they became incurable; and\r\n(4) power to the poor-law guardians to give outdoor relief under the\r\ncircumstances stated.[285]\r\n\r\nThe Bill had the approval of the Social Science Congress committee, and\r\nof Lord O'Hagan, but on account of the pressure of other business never\r\nreached the House of Lords.[286] It should be added that the Government,\r\nin the person of the Solicitor-General, expressed a hope that they would\r\nbe able to bring in a Bill of larger scope, one more fully covering the\r\nground traversed by the Royal Commission of 1879.\r\n\r\nThe sketch now made, slight as it is, will serve to show that Ireland\r\nformed no exception to the neglect to which the insane were subjected,\r\nespecially in the poor-houses and jails; that when attention was\r\nstrongly drawn to the better treatment of the insane in England, partly\r\nby the publication of a work describing how this was to be carried out,\r\nand partly by the evidence given before the Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons in 1815, the Irish Government took up the question of\r\nreform, and resolutely set about putting their own house in order.\r\nSelect Committees collected valuable evidence which bore fruit in\r\nefficient legislative enactments, and there seems to have been\r\nsingularly little opposition to the introduction of improved methods of\r\ntreatment and new buildings in place of the old. The Richmond Asylum\r\nfrom the first led the way in enlightened modes of treatment, and at the\r\npresent time this institution, under the long and able management of Dr.\r\nLalor, is a credit to Ireland; the more so that here, more efficiently\r\nthan in any asylum I have visited in the British Isles, the employment\r\nof the patients in school work has been introduced and prosecuted to a\r\nsuccessful issue.[287]\r\n\r\nOne other feature of the history of this movement in Ireland has already\r\nbeen alluded to, but merits attention again, and that is the additional\r\nproof afforded of the inevitable tendency to the accumulation of cases,\r\ninstead of their recovery on a large scale, as was at first hoped and\r\nexpected, not in Ireland alone, but in England. The frequency of relapse\r\nwas, in the outburst of delight accompanying the recovery of some cases\r\nhopelessly incurable under the old system, not suspected, and the bitter\r\ndisappointment which this fact involves had yet to be experienced, and\r\nis, indeed, scarcely realised at this moment. In one of the Irish\r\nReports, the circumstance is alluded to that, taking all the discharges\r\nof patients on account of recovery, the cures amounted to the gratifying\r\nnumber of seventy per cent. Had this proportion been sustained, and had\r\nthese patients retained their mental health, there would have been\r\nlittle need of additional asylums. Patients from all quarters, their\r\nhomes, poor-houses, and even jails, might have been drafted for a season\r\ninto these temples of health, and, having passed the charmed threshold,\r\nbeen restored in a few months to the outer world, never to return.\r\n\r\nIf this pleasant illusion is dispelled by the course of events in\r\nIreland, how much more strikingly must it be so in England? for the\r\nformer country is almost altogether free from that most hopeless of all\r\nmental affections, the general paralysis of the insane--the plague of\r\nall other civilized countries--and has fewer epileptics.\r\n\r\nThere are now in Ireland 43 district and private asylums, with a\r\npopulation of insane persons amounting to 9289. There are 163\r\npoor-houses in which there are insane and idiotic persons.\r\n\r\nThe insane under the jurisdiction of the Inspectors on the 1st of\r\nJanuary, 1881, were thus distributed:--\r\n\r\n  In district asylums                    8,667\r\n  In the Dundrum or Criminal Asylum        180\r\n  At Palmerston House                       19[288]\r\n  In private licensed houses               622[289]\r\n  In 163 union workhouses                3,573\r\n                                        ------\r\n                                 Total  13,061[290]\r\n\r\nAs many as 1270 patients were received as dangerous lunatics under the\r\n30 and 31 Vict., c. 118.\r\n\r\nWill nothing be done to simplify admission? \"Had the Bill introduced by\r\nMr. Litton during the past session become law, the admission order\r\nuniversally used in England would have extended to Ireland, so that in\r\ntime the present confusion and difficulty experienced in obtaining\r\nadmission to Irish asylums might have been removed by the substitution\r\nof one simple order for the complicated machinery at present in\r\nexistence. The Inspectors, however, seem to consider that the\r\nintroduction of the Bill extending protection under the 16 and 17 Vict.,\r\nc. 97, to the insane who are at present not under State provision, would\r\nbe to fill hospitals for the insane with unpromising cases, at a\r\nconsiderable increase of expenditure, to the exclusion of others more\r\nurgent or more hopeful. The answer to this seems plain, that if the\r\naccommodation for the insane is inadequate, every effort should be made\r\nto provide increased means of protection for those who are unable to\r\ncare for themselves. It cannot surely be reasonably maintained that\r\nbecause the accommodation is inadequate for the want of the insane\r\npopulation, for that reason no further legislation should be put in\r\nforce for their better protection, nor does the supposition that\r\nmistakes might occur in sending people to asylums who do not require to\r\nbe deprived of their freedom, deserve more serious consideration. That\r\nsuch mistakes may and will occur for all time cannot be doubted, but\r\nthere cannot be any reason to suppose that because increased supervision\r\nis provided, these mistakes would become more frequent. Such has not\r\nbeen found the case in England, where this Act has been in force for\r\nmany years.\"[291]\r\n\r\nThe best thing we can hope for the effectual care of the insane in\r\nIreland is legislation in the direction indicated by Lord O'Hagan and\r\nMr. Litton.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDUM.\r\n\r\nTABLE A.\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF PATIENTS IN DISTRICT ASYLUMS, JANUARY 1, 1881.\r\n\r\n  -------------+----------+-------------+--------\r\n     Asylum.   |  Males.  |   Females.  | Total.\r\n  -------------+----------+-------------+--------\r\n  Armagh       |   100    |      96     |   196\r\n  Ballinasloe  |   266    |     197     |   463\r\n  Belfast      |   262    |     201     |   463\r\n  Carlow       |   137    |     116     |   253\r\n  Castlebar    |   174    |     115     |   289\r\n  Clonmel      |   213    |     197     |   410\r\n  Cork         |   450    |     420     |   870\r\n  Down         |   197    |     141     |   338\r\n  Ennis        |   140    |     121     |   261\r\n  Enniscorthy  |   157    |     143     |   300\r\n  Kilkenny     |   129    |     114     |   243\r\n  Killarney    |   178    |     124     |   302\r\n  Letterkenny  |   200    |      99     |   299\r\n  Limerick     |   235    |     244     |   479\r\n  Londonderry  |   147    |     124     |   271\r\n  Maryborough  |   155    |     118     |   273\r\n  Monaghan     |   244    |     159     |   403\r\n  Mullingar    |   240    |     194     |   434\r\n  Omagh        |   284    |     201     |   485\r\n  Richmond     |   451    |     571     |  1022\r\n  Sligo        |   200    |     141     |   341\r\n  Waterford    |   126    |     146     |   272\r\n               +----------+-------------+--------\r\n               |  4685    |    3982     |  8667\r\n  -------------+----------+-------------+--------\r\n\r\nWORKHOUSES.\r\n\r\n                        Insane and Idiots.\r\n\r\n  Ulster                     1054\r\n  Munster                    1036\r\n  Leinster                   1170\r\n  Connaught                   313\r\n                             ----\r\n                             3573\r\n\r\n  In jails                      3\r\n  In Dundrum                  180\r\n\r\nTABLE B.\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF PATIENTS IN PRIVATE ASYLUMS, JANUARY 1, 1881.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------+------+--------+------\r\n                                       |Males.|Females.|Total.\r\n  -------------------------------------+------+--------+------\r\n  Armagh Retreat                       |  16  |    9   |  25\r\n  Bloomfield Retreat, Co.

To it I would\r\naccord a hearty welcome, speaking on behalf of this Association, which\r\nnumbers amongst its honorary members so many distinguished alienists,\r\nAmerican and European. Bounded by the limits of our four seas, we are in\r\ndanger of overlooking the merits of those who live and work beyond them.\r\nI recall the observation of Arnold of Rugby, that if we were not a very\r\nactive people, our disunion from the Continent would make us nearly as\r\nbad as the Chinese. \"Foreigners say,\" he goes on to remark, \"that our\r\ninsular situation cramps and narrows our minds. And this is not mere\r\nnonsense either. What is wanted is a deep knowledge of, and sympathy\r\nwith, the European character and institutions, and then there would be a\r\nhope that we might each impart to the other that in which we are\r\nsuperior.\"\r\n\r\nDo we not owe to France the classic works of Pinel and of\r\nEsquirol--justly styled the Hippocrates of Psychological Medicine--works\r\nwhose value time can never destroy; and have not these masters in\r\nMedical Psychology been followed by an array of brilliant names familiar\r\nto us as household words, Georget, Bayle, Ferrus, Foville, Leuret,\r\nFalret, Voisin, Trelat, Parchappe, Morel, Marce, who have passed\r\naway,[293] and by those now living who, either inheriting their name or\r\nworthy of their fame, will be inscribed on the long roll of celebrated\r\npsychologists of which that country can boast.\r\n\r\nIf Haslam may seem to have stumbled upon General Paralysis, we may well\r\naccord to French alienists the merit of having really discovered the\r\ndisorder which, in our department, is the most fascinating, as it has\r\nformed the most prominent object of research, during the last forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nTo mention Austria and Germany, is to recall Langermann,\r\nFeuchtersleben, Reil, Friedreich, Jacobi, Zeller, Griesinger, Roller,\r\nand Flemming, who, full of years and honours, has now passed away.\r\n\r\nHas not Belgium her Guislain, Holland her Schroeder van der Kolk, and\r\nItaly her Chiaruggi?\r\n\r\nAnd when I pass from Europe to the American continent, many well-known\r\nnames arise, at whose head stands the celebrated Dr. Rush. Woodward,\r\nBell, Brigham, and Howe (whose many-sided labour included the idiot)\r\nwill be long remembered, and now, alas! I have to include among the dead\r\nan honoured name, over whom the grave has recently closed. Saintship is\r\nnot the exclusive property of the Church. Medicine has also her\r\ncalendar. Not a few physicians of the mind have deserved to be\r\ncanonized; and to our psychological Hagiology, I would now add the name\r\nof Isaac Ray. With his fellow-workers in the same field, among whom are\r\nmen not less honoured, I would venture to express the sympathy of this\r\nAssociation in the loss they have sustained. Nor can I pass from these\r\nnames, although departing from my intention of mentioning only the dead,\r\nwithout paying a tribute of respect to that remarkable woman, Miss Dix,\r\nwho has a claim to the gratitude of mankind for having consecrated the\r\nbest years of her varied life to the fearless advocacy of the cause of\r\nthe insane, and to whose exertions not a few of the institutions for\r\ntheir care and treatment in the States owe their origin.\r\n\r\nAbroad, psychological journalism has been in advance of ours.\r\n\r\nThe French alienists established in 1843 their _Annales\r\nMedico-Psychologiques_ (one of whose editors, M. Foville, is with us\r\nto-day), five years before Dr. Winslow issued his Journal, the first\r\ndevoted to medical psychology in this country, and ten years before our\r\nown _Journal_ appeared, in 1853.\r\n\r\nThe Germans and Americans began their Journals in the following\r\nyear--1844; the former, the _Allgemeine Zeitschrift fuer Psychiatrie_,\r\nand the latter the _American Journal of Insanity_.\r\n\r\nI believe that our Association has precedence of any other devoted to\r\nMedical Psychology, and it is an interesting fact that its establishment\r\nled to that of the corresponding Association in France--a society whose\r\nsecretary, M. Motet, I am glad to see among my auditors. The Association\r\nof Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane was\r\ninstituted in 1844; that of Germany in 1864, the subject of Psychology\r\nhaving previously formed a section of a Medical Association.\r\n\r\nReturning to our own country, I may observe that when Dr. Hitch, of the\r\nGloucester Asylum, issued the circular which led to the formation of\r\nthis Association in 1841, almost half a century had elapsed since the\r\nepoch (1792) which I may call the renaissance of the humane treatment of\r\nthe insane, when the Bicetre in France, and the York Retreat in England,\r\noriginated by their example an impulse still unspent, destined in the\r\ncourse of years to triumph, as we witness to-day. This triumph was\r\nsecured, in large measure, by the efforts of two men who, forty years\r\nago, shortly after the well-known experiment at Lincoln, by the late\r\nMr. Robert Gardiner Hill, were actively engaged in ameliorating the\r\ncondition of the insane. Need I say that I refer to Lord Shaftesbury and\r\nDr. Conolly? The nobleman and the physician (alike forward to recognize\r\nthe services of the pioneers of 1792), each in his own sphere having a\r\ncommon end in view, and animated by the same spirit, gave an impetus to\r\nthe movement, the value and far-reaching extent of which it is almost\r\nimpossible to exaggerate. Lord Shaftesbury,[294] celebrating his\r\neightieth birthday this year, still lives to witness the fruits of his\r\nlabours, of which the success of the well-known Acts with which his name\r\nis associated, will form an enduring memorial. Dr. Conolly was in his\r\nprime. He had been two years at Hanwell, and was contending against\r\ngreat difficulties with the courageous determination which characterized\r\nhim. I do not hold the memory of Conolly in respect, merely or\r\nprincipally because he was the apostle of non-restraint, but because,\r\nalthough doubtless fallible (and indiscriminate eulogy would defeat its\r\nobject), he infused into the treatment of the insane a contagious\r\nearnestness possessing a value far beyond any mere system or dogma. His\r\nreal merit, his true glory, is to have leavened the opinions and\r\nstimulated the best energies of many of his contemporaries, to have\r\nstirred their enthusiasm and inflamed their zeal, to have not only\r\ntransmitted but to have rendered brighter the torch which he seized from\r\nthe hands of his predecessors. He desired to be remembered after his\r\ndeath by asylum superintendents as one who sincerely wished to place the\r\ninsane in better hands than those in which he too generally found them;\r\nand I hold that, whatever may be our views on what we have chosen to\r\ncall non-restraint, we may cordially unite in fulfilling his desire.\r\n\r\nAs the non-restraint system--a term, it must be confessed, which cannot\r\nboast of scientific precision, but is well understood--has been the\r\nleading, and often engrossing, topic of discussion during the period now\r\nunder review, I must not omit a brief reference to it. No one will call\r\nin question the statement as an historical fact that the Commissioners\r\nin Lunacy and the medical superintendents of asylums in this country\r\nare, with few exceptions, in favour of non-restraint. Dr. Lauder\r\nLindsay--for whose death, as well as that of Dr. Sherlock and of Dr.\r\nWhite Williams, during the last year, the tribute of sorrowful regret\r\nought, in passing, to be paid--Dr. Lindsay, I say, had only a small\r\nfollowing in Great Britain. In Germany, on the other hand, although\r\nGriesinger looked favourably upon the system, and Westphal has advocated\r\nit, and Brosius has translated Conolly's standard work into German,\r\nthere has not been a general conversion, as may be seen by the\r\ndiscussion which took place in 1879, at meetings of the Psychological\r\nSociety in Berlin and Heidelberg. In France, again, although Morel gave\r\nit the sanction of his name, and Magnan has practised it recently, there\r\nhas been within the last twelve months a striking proof of\r\nanti-non-restraint opinion among the French physicians, in an\r\ninteresting discussion at the Societe Medico-Psychologique. I wish here\r\nonly to chronicle the fact, and would urge the necessity of not\r\nconfounding honest differences of opinion with differences of humane\r\nfeeling. The non-restrainer is within his right when he practises the\r\nsystem carried to its extremest lengths. He is within his right when he\r\npreaches its advantages to others. But he is not within his right if he\r\ndenounces those physicians, equally humane as himself, who differ from\r\nhim in opinion and practice. I therefore unite with the observation of\r\nDr. Ray, by whom, as well as by the majority of his\r\nfellow-psychologists, the non-restraint system as a doctrine was not\r\naccepted, when he wrote thus in 1855, \"Here, as well as everywhere else,\r\nthe privilege of free and independent inquiry cannot be invaded without\r\nultimate injury to the cause.\"[295]\r\n\r\nThe arguments in favour of mechanical restraint are clearly set forth by\r\nDr. John Gray, of the Utica Asylum, in his annual report of the present\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nLeaving this subject let me recall to your recollection that when this\r\nAssociation was formed, the care of the insane in England and Wales was\r\nregulated by the Gordon-Ashley Act of 1828,[296] which, among other\r\nreforms, had substituted for the authority of five Fellows of the\r\nCollege of Physicians, who performed their duties in the most slovenly\r\nmanner, fifteen metropolitan Commissioners in Lunacy. I find, on\r\nexamining the Annual Report of these Commissioners issued in 1841, that\r\nit does not extend over more than one page and a half! It is signed by\r\nAshley, Gordon, Turner, Southey, and Proctor. They report the number\r\nconfined in the thirty-three asylums within their jurisdiction as 2490.\r\nTheir verdict on inspecting them is expressed in half a dozen words,\r\nnamely, that the \"result is upon the whole satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\n\"The business of this Commission,\" they say, \"has very much increased,\r\npartly by more frequent communications with the provinces (over which,\r\nhowever, they have no direct legal control), and partly by the more\r\nminute attention directed by the Commissioners to individual cases with\r\na view to the liberation of convalescent patients upon trial ... and the\r\nconsequence has been that many persons have been liberated who otherwise\r\nwould have remained in confinement.\"\r\n\r\nThat a state of things in which such an occurrence was possible should\r\nbe described as on the whole satisfactory, is somewhat remarkable, and\r\nin reading this paragraph we cannot but contrast with it the very\r\ndifferent result of the investigation made by the Committee of the House\r\nof Commons in 1877.\r\n\r\nAgain, nothing more strikingly marks the change which has taken place in\r\nthe inspection of asylums than the contrast between the last Report of\r\nthe Lunacy Commissioners, consisting of a bulky volume of more than four\r\nhundred pages, and that of 1841, of a page and a half. In fact, the\r\nReports of the Commissioners form the best evidence to which I can refer\r\nof the progress made from year to year in the provision for the insane,\r\nand the gradual but uninterrupted amelioration of their condition.\r\n\r\nAn important advance was made in 1842 by the Act 5 and 6 Vict., c. 87,\r\nwhich provided that provincial houses were to be visited by the\r\nMetropolitan Commissioners, as well as those in their own district. They\r\nwere also to report whether restraint was practised in any asylum, and\r\nwhether the patients were properly amused and occupied. Not only was a\r\ngreat step forward made by thus extending the inspecting power of these\r\nCommissioners to the provinces, but their memorable Report on the state\r\nof the asylums in England and Wales in 1844 led to the highly important\r\nlegislation of the following year (introduced by Lord Ashley)--the Act 8\r\nand 9 Vict., c. 100, which along with the Acts of 1853 (16 and 17 Vict.,\r\ncc. 96, 97)[297] and 1862 (25 and 26 Vict., c. 111) form, as you are\r\nwell aware, the Code of Lunacy Law under which, for the most part, the\r\ncare of the insane is determined and their protection secured.\r\n\r\nI should like to have been able to state the number of recognized\r\nlunatics in England and Wales forty years ago, but no return exists\r\nwhich shows it. The nearest approach is to be found in the Report just\r\nreferred to of the Metropolitan Commissioners (1844), in which the\r\nnumber of ascertained lunatics in England and Wales is stated to be\r\nabout 20,000, of whom only 11,272 were confined in asylums, whereas now\r\nthere are nearly 55,000. It is difficult to realize that there were then\r\nonly some 4000 patients in county asylums, these being 15 in number, and\r\nthat there were 21 counties in England and Wales in which there were no\r\nasylums of any kind, public or private. At the present time, instead of\r\n20,000 ascertained lunatics and idiots, we have 73,113--an increase\r\nrepresented by the population of the City of York--instead of 15 county\r\nasylums we have 51, with scarcely less than 40,000 patients, instead of\r\n4000; while the provincial licensed houses have decreased from 99 to 59,\r\nand the metropolitan increased by 2. The total number of asylums in\r\nEngland and Wales in 1844 was 158,[298] now it is 175--excluding those\r\n(3) erected under Hardy's Act. I need not say that these figures do not\r\nnecessarily point to an increase of lunacy, but may merely represent the\r\nincreased accommodation which ought to have been provided long before.\r\nInto the general question of the spread of insanity I feel that it would\r\nbe impossible to enter satisfactorily now.\r\n\r\nRecurring to the Metropolitan Commissioners' Report, I must observe that\r\nwhile an immense advance took place between 1828, when they were\r\nappointed, and 1844, the subsequent advance between the latter date and\r\nnow is such that we cannot but recognize the extremely beneficial\r\noperation of the legislation which has marked this period. It must also\r\nbe gratifying to Scotch asylum superintendents, knowing as they do the\r\nsatisfactory condition of the insane in their country in 1881, to be\r\nable to measure the progress made since Lord Ashley, in his speech in\r\n1844, moved for an address to the Crown, praying her Majesty to take\r\ninto consideration the Commissioners' Report, for he there observes, \"I\r\nbelieve that not in any country in Europe, nor in any part of America,\r\nis there any place in which pauper lunatics are in such a suffering and\r\ndegraded state as those in her Majesty's kingdom of Scotland.\" I need\r\nnot do more than chronicle the fact, in passing, that the reform in\r\nScotland dates, to a large extent, from the appointment of a Royal\r\nCommission in 1855, and the action of the Board of Lunacy Commissioners\r\nwhich was established in consequence. Legislation for Ireland and the\r\nappointment of inspectors have likewise proved very beneficial in that\r\ncountry. But restricting my remarks to England and Wales, I would\r\nobserve that the establishment by the Act of 1845 of the Lunacy Board as\r\nat present constituted, and the rendering it compulsory upon counties to\r\nprovide asylums for pauper lunatics, are the chief causes of the\r\nimprovement to which I have referred, so far, at least, as it has been\r\nbrought about by legislation.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell in detail on the lunacy legislation of these years. To\r\nhave said less would have been to overlook the salient and most\r\nimportant facts of the period. To have said more would have been to\r\ntravel over the ground so ably occupied by Dr. Blandford in his\r\nPresidential Address three years ago. He, by-the-by, complained of the\r\never-increasing difficulty each President finds in selecting a subject\r\nfor his discourse, and then immediately proceeded to effectually lessen\r\nthe chances of his successors. What the last occupant of this Chair will\r\nbe able to discover new for his address I do not know. I can only think\r\nof the funeral oration over this Association at its obsequies--when its\r\n\"dying eyes are closed,\" its \"decent limbs composed,\" and its \"humble\r\ngrave adorn'd,\"\r\n\r\n    \"By strangers honour'd, by survivors mourn'd.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Board of the Commissioners in Lunacy have sat two members of our\r\nprofession (one still living), to whose services I wish more especially\r\nto refer. I allude to Dr. Prichard and Mr. Gaskell.\r\n\r\nApart from his official work, the former will always be remembered in\r\nthe republic of letters by his learned contributions to anthropology and\r\nthe literature of mental diseases, in which he is more especially\r\nidentified with the doctrine of Moral Insanity. Chronicler of the period\r\nin which he enunciated or rather developed it, I cannot avoid a brief\r\nreference to a theme which has caused so much heated discussion. As an\r\nimpartial historian I am bound to admit that his views are still by no\r\nmeans unanimously adopted, and that I am only expressing my own\r\nsentiments when I avow that what Latham says of Prichard's \"Researches\r\ninto the Physical History of Mankind\"--\"Let those who doubt its value,\r\ntry to do without it\"--applies to the teaching contained in the\r\nremarkable treatise entitled \"Different Forms of Insanity in relation to\r\nJurisprudence,\" published in 1842. We may well be dissatisfied with some\r\nof the illustrations of the doctrine it supports. We may express in\r\ndifferent terms the generalization he has made as to the relation of\r\nintellect and emotion; but I am greatly mistaken if we shall not from\r\ntime to time be confronted by facts which instantly raise the question\r\nwhich presented itself with so much force to his acute mind, and which\r\ndoes not appear to me to be successfully met by those who controvert the\r\nconclusions at which Prichard arrived. The necessity of admitting in\r\nsome form or other the mental facts in dispute, is well illustrated by\r\nthe recent work by Krafft-Ebing on mental disorders. For what does this\r\npractised mental expert do? He, although the supporter of mental\r\nsolidarity and the integrity of the Ego--adverse, therefore, to the\r\npsychology in which the theory has been enshrined--feels that he must\r\nadmit into his classification some term which describes certain\r\nemotional or volitional disorders, and can discover none better than\r\n\"moral insanity\"--a practical, though reluctant, admission of the value\r\nof Prichard's views after their discussion for forty years. I might also\r\nrefer as an indication of opinion to a most excellent article in the\r\nlast number of the _Journal_ by Dr. Savage, who, while recognizing the\r\nabstract metaphysical difficulty of conceiving moral as distinct from\r\nintellectual insanity, fully admits as a clinical fact the form of\r\nmental disease for which Prichard contended, and had he been living he\r\nwould doubtless have claimed this article as a striking proof of the\r\nvitality of his opinions.\r\n\r\nOne is certainly disposed to exclaim, if observation on the one hand\r\ncompels us to admit certain mental facts, and the metaphysician on the\r\nother declares them to be unmetaphysical, so much the worse for\r\nmetaphysics!\r\n\r\nMr. Gaskell, in addition to his good work as a reformer at the Lancaster\r\nAsylum, where may yet be seen preserved quite a museum of articles of\r\nrestraint formerly in use in that institution, and his efficient labours\r\nas a Commissioner, was also, it may not be generally known, the real\r\ncause of the practical steps taken in this country to educate the idiot.\r\nIt was in 1847 that he wrote some articles in _Chamber's Journal_,\r\ngiving an account of Seguin's Idiot School at the Bicetre, which he had\r\nvisited and been greatly interested in. These articles had the effect of\r\ninducing Dr. Andrew Reed to interest himself in the establishment of a\r\nschool for idiots in England. The Highgate and Colchester Asylums for\r\nidiots were instituted--the origin, as it proved, of the great\r\nestablishment at Earlswood. All, therefore, that has been done for this\r\npitiable class has been effected during the last forty years. The\r\nindefatigable Seguin has passed away during the last twelve months. He\r\npursued to the last, with unabated zeal, a study possessing attractions\r\nfor only a limited number, and advocated the claims of idiots and\r\nimbeciles with unceasing energy in the Old World and the New.\r\nFortunately his mantle has descended upon a worthy successor in the\r\nperson of his son, Dr. E. Seguin, of New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has necessarily happened that the direction of public attention to\r\nthe larger and better provision for the insane in all civilized lands\r\nhas led to much consideration, and inevitably some difference of\r\nopinion as regards the form and arrangement of asylums. But all will\r\nadmit that their construction has undergone a vast improvement in forty\r\nyears. The tendency at the present moment is to attach less importance\r\nto bricks and mortar, and the security of the patient within a walled\r\nenclosure, than to grant the largest possible amount of freedom, in\r\nasylums, compatible with safety. The more this is carried out, the\r\neasier, it is to be hoped, will it be to induce the friends of patients\r\nto allow them to go in the earliest stage of the disorder to an asylum,\r\nas readily as they would to a hydropathic establishment or an ordinary\r\nhospital, to which end medical men may do much by ignoring the stupid\r\nstigma still attaching to having been in an asylum. The treatment of the\r\ninsane ought to be such that we should be able to regard the asylums of\r\nthe land as one vast Temple of Health, in which the priests of\r\nEsculapius, rivalling the Egyptians and Greeks of old, are constantly\r\nministering, and are sacrificing their time and talents on the altar of\r\nPsyche.[299]\r\n\r\nMost heartily do I agree with Dr. Kirkbride when he says that \"Asylums\r\ncan never be dispensed with--no matter how persistently ignorance,\r\nprejudice, or sophistry may declare to the contrary--without\r\nretrograding to a greater or less extent to the conditions of a past\r\nperiod with all the inhumanity and barbarity connected with it. To\r\nunderstand what would be the situation of a people without hospitals\r\nfor their insane, it is only necessary to learn what their condition was\r\nwhen there were none.\"[300]\r\n\r\nIn advocating the prompt and facile recourse to an asylum, I include, of\r\ncourse, the cottage treatment of the insane so long ago resorted to by\r\nDr. Bucknill, and extended in so admirable a manner by my immediate\r\npredecessor in this chair, whose practical observations last year on the\r\nvillas and cottages at Cheadle rendered his address one of the most\r\nvaluable that has been delivered. Moreover, I would not say a word in\r\ndisparagement of the placing of suitable cases in the houses of medical\r\nmen, or in lodgings, under frequent medical visitation.[301] I also\r\nrecognize the value of intermediate or border-land institutions, so long\r\nas they are conducted with the sanction of the Commissioners and open to\r\ntheir inspection.\r\n\r\nThe modern advocacy of the open-door system has been recently brought\r\nunder the notice of the Association by Dr. Needham, with the view of\r\nobtaining a general expression of opinion on a practice, to the wisdom\r\nof which he is disposed to demur.\r\n\r\nBut a less regard for mere bricks and mortar, the removal of high\r\nboundary walls and contracted airing-courts, or the introduction of the\r\nopen-door system, do not lessen the importance of properly constructed\r\nasylums. The works of Jacobi in Germany, Kirkbride in America, Parchappe\r\nin France, and Conolly in England, must retain their value as classical\r\nproductions on this subject; while the contributions recently made by\r\nDr. Clouston present not only the general principles of asylum\r\nconstruction, but the minute details of building, in the light of the\r\nknowledge and experience of the present day.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate in being able to render M. Parchappe some service when\r\nhe visited England to examine the construction of our asylums. Those who\r\nformed his acquaintance on the occasion of this visit may remember his\r\nmixed feelings on visiting them, how he demurred on the one hand to what\r\nhe regarded as too costly and ornamental, while, on the other hand, he\r\nliked the English arrangement of the buildings better than the\r\nEsquirol-Desportes system. I need not point out that those who have had\r\nthe planning of the county asylums in England have objected, as well as\r\nParchappe, to the distribution of isolated pavilions upon parallel\r\nlines. Parchappe, while far from believing it to be indispensable to\r\nmake asylums monuments fitted to excite admiration for the richness of\r\ntheir architecture, and indisposed to emulate our asylums, which, he\r\nsays, only belong to princely mansions, turns nevertheless from the\r\nsquare courts and the isolated pavilions of Esquirol to apostrophize the\r\nformer in these glowing terms:--\r\n\r\n\"How much more suited to reanimate torpid intelligence and feeling, or\r\nto distract and console melancholy among the unfortunate insane, these\r\nedifices majestic in their general effect and comfortable in their\r\ndetails, these grandiose parks, with luxuriant plantations and verdant\r\nflowery lawns, whose harmonious association impresses upon English\r\nasylums an exceptional character of calm and powerful beauty!\"\r\n\r\nWhether a stranger, having read this florid description of our asylums,\r\nwould not, on visiting them, be a little disappointed, I will not stop\r\nto inquire. Probably during this or the following week, some of\r\nParchappe's compatriots may answer the question for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental question of the separation of the curable and incurable\r\nclasses has in different countries been earnestly discussed during the\r\nlast forty years. Kirkbride has entered his \"special and earnest\r\nprotest\" against this separation; his own countryman, Dr. Stearns, on\r\nthe other hand, has lately advocated it. In Germany, where, following\r\nthe lead of Langermann and Reil, complete separation of the curable in\r\none building was first realized under Jacobi at Siegburg, there has been\r\na complete reversion to the system of combining the two classes in one\r\ninstitution. Parchappe, who opposed the separation of these classes, as\r\nillusory if justice is done to the incurable in the construction of the\r\nbuilding provided for them, and mischievous if this is denied them, was\r\nconstrained to admit, however, in view of the enormous number of\r\nlunatics in the Department of the Seine, that it was the least of two\r\nevils to separate the epileptic and the idiotic from the curable.\r\n\r\nIn England the separation principle has been recognized in Hardy's Act\r\n(30 Vict., c. 6) for the establishment in the metropolis of asylums for\r\nthe sick, insane, and other classes of the poor, 1867; and, again, in\r\nthe erection of such an asylum as Banstead for Middlesex--and I am\r\ninformed by Dr. Claye Shaw, who, from holding the office of\r\nsuperintendent there, and formerly superintending the Metropolitan\r\nDistrict Asylum of Leavesden, is well calculated to judge, that the\r\nexperiment has proved successful, that the patients do not suffer, and\r\nthat the office of superintendent is not rendered unendurable. Regarded\r\nfrom an economic point of view, it has been found practicable to provide\r\nbuildings at a cost of between L80 and L90 per bed, which, though not\r\naesthetic, are carefully planned for the care and oversight of the\r\ninmates. This includes not only the land, but furnishing the asylum.\r\n\r\nFive years ago this Association unanimously adopted a resolution,\r\nexpressing satisfaction that the Charity Organization Society had taken\r\nup the subject of the better provision, in the provinces, for idiots,\r\nimbeciles, and harmless lunatics, and the following year carried a\r\nresolution, also unanimous, that the arrangement made for these classes\r\nin the metropolitan district is applicable in its main principles to the\r\nrest of England. But it does not follow that the separation of these\r\nclasses from the county asylums should be so complete, either as\r\nrespects locality or the governing board, as in the metropolitan\r\ndistrict; and, further, the Association expressed a strong opinion that\r\nthe boarding-out system, although impracticable in the urban districts,\r\nshould be attempted wherever possible in the country; the greatest care\r\nbeing taken to select suitable cases, unless we wish to witness the\r\nevils which Dr. Fraser has so graphically depicted in his report for\r\n1877 of the Fife and Kinross Asylum. If pauper asylums can, without\r\ninjury to families, be relieved by harmless cases being sent home to the\r\nextent Dr. Duckworth Williams has succeeded in doing in Sussex, and if,\r\nas he proposes, they were periodically visited, their names being\r\nretained on the asylum books, the enlargement of some asylums might be\r\nrendered unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut what, gentlemen, would be the best-contrived separation of cases,\r\nwhat would the best-constructed asylum avail, unless the presiding\r\nauthority were equal to his responsible duties? Now, it is one of the\r\nhappy circumstances connected with the great movement which has taken\r\nplace in this and other countries, that men have arisen in large numbers\r\nwho have proved themselves equal to the task. We witness the creation of\r\nan almost new character--the asylum superintendent.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon, some years ago, Dr. Ray fell asleep in his chair\r\nwhile reading old Fuller's portraits of the Good Merchant, the Good\r\nJudge, the Good Soldier, etc., in his work entitled \"The Holy and\r\nProfane State,\" and, so sleeping, dreamed he read a manuscript, the\r\nfirst chapter of which was headed, \"The Good Superintendent.\" Awakening\r\nfrom his nap by the tongs falling on the hearth, the doctor determined\r\nto reproduce from memory as much of his dream as possible for the\r\nbenefit of his brethren. One of these recovered fragments runs\r\nthus:--\"The Good Superintendent hath considered well his qualifications\r\nfor the office he hath assumed, and been governed not more by a regard\r\nfor his fortunes than by a hearty desire to benefit his fellow-men....\r\nTo fix his hold on the confidence and goodwill of his patients he\r\nspareth no effort, though it may consume his time and tax his patience,\r\nor encroach seemingly on the dignity of his office. A formal walk\r\nthrough the wards, and the ordering of a few drugs, compriseth but a\r\nsmall part of his means for restoring the troubled mind. To prepare for\r\nthis work, and to make other means effectual, he carefully studieth the\r\nmental movements of his patients. He never grudges the moments spent in\r\nquiet, familiar intercourse with them, for thereby he gaineth many\r\nglimpses of their inner life that may help him in their treatment.... He\r\nmaketh himself the centre of their system around which they all revolve,\r\nbeing held in their places by the attraction of respect and\r\nconfidence.\"[302]\r\n\r\nAnd much more so admirable that it is difficult to stay one's hand. You\r\nwill, I think, agree with me that what Dr. Ray dreamed is better than\r\nwhat many write when they are wide awake, and those familiar with Dr.\r\nRay's career, and his character, will be of the opinion of another\r\nTransatlantic worthy (Dr. John Gray, of Utica) that in this act of\r\nunconscious cerebration the dreamer unwittingly described himself--\r\n\r\n    \"'The Good Superintendent!' Who is he?\r\n        The master asked again and again;\r\n      But answered himself, unconsciously,\r\n        And wrote his own life without a stain.\"\r\n\r\nIn what a strange land of shadows the superintendent lives! But for his\r\nfamiliarity with it, its strangeness would oftener strike him. It\r\nbecomes a matter of course that those with whom he mixes in daily life\r\nare of imperial or royal blood--nay, more, possess divine\r\nattributes--and that some who are maintained for half a guinea a week\r\npossess millions and quadrillions of gold. He lives, in truth, in a\r\nworld inhabited by the creatures of the imagination of those by whom he\r\nis constantly surrounded--a domain in which _his_ views of life and\r\nthings in general are in a miserable minority--a phantom world of ideal\r\nforms and unearthly voices and mysterious sounds, incessantly disputing\r\nhis authority, and commanding his patients in terms claiming\r\nsupernatural force to do those things which he orders them to leave\r\nundone, and to leave undone those things which he orders them to do;\r\ncommanding them to be silent, to starve themselves, to kill, to mutilate\r\nor hang themselves; in short, there is in this remarkable country,\r\npeopled by so many thousand inhabitants, an _imperium in imperio_ which\r\nrenders the contest continuous between the rival authorities struggling\r\nfor supremacy, sometimes, it must be confessed, ending in the triumph of\r\nthe ideal forms, and the phantom voices, and the visionary sights, which\r\nmay be smiled at in our studies, and curiously analyzed in our\r\nscientific alembics, but cannot be ignored in practice without the\r\noccurrence of dire catastrophes, and the unpleasant realization of the\r\ntruth that idealism, phantasy, and vision may be transformed into\r\ndangerous forms of force. It may be said, indeed, that the appropriate\r\nmotto of the medical superintendent is--\"_Insanitas insanitatum, omnia\r\ninsanitas._\"\r\n\r\nWith such an _entourage_ it is not surprising if the first residence in\r\nan asylum as its responsible head--especially an asylum in the olden\r\ndays--should disconcert even a physician. A German psychologist once\r\ndeclared, after passing his first night in an institution as\r\nsuperintendent, that he could not remain there; he felt overwhelmed with\r\nhis position. Yet this physician remained not only over the next night,\r\nbut for thirty-five years, to live honoured and venerated as Maximilian\r\nJacobi, and departing to leave behind him \"footprints on the sands of\r\ntime,\" from seeing which, others, in a similar hour of discouragement,\r\nmay again take heart.\r\n\r\nI cannot pass from this subject without enforcing, as a practical\r\ncomment, the necessity of asylum physicians having a very liberal supply\r\nof holidays, so as to insure a complete change of thought from not only\r\nthe objective but the subjective world in which they live, and this\r\nbefore the time comes when they are unable to throw off their work from\r\ntheir minds, as happened to a hard-working friend of mine, who, even\r\nduring his holiday among the Alps, must needs dream one night that he\r\nwas making a post-mortem upon himself, and on another night rose from\r\nhis bed in a state of somnambulism to perform certain aberrant and\r\ndisorderly acts, not unlike what his patients would have performed in\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nI have heard it suggested that superintendents should have six weeks'\r\nextra holiday every third year, five of them to be spent in visiting\r\nasylums. Whether this is the best way of acquiring an interchange of\r\nexperience or not, I will not decide, but no doubt the feeling, how\r\ndesirable it is men should compare notes with their fellow-workers,\r\nprompted the founders of our Association (which was expected to be more\r\nperipatetic than has proved to be the case) to determine that its\r\nmembers should at its annual meetings carefully examine some institution\r\nfor the insane.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that only second in importance to a good\r\nsuperintendent is a good attendant, and of him also Dr. Ray dreamed in\r\nhis Sunday afternoon vision, and his description is equally excellent.\r\n\r\nI am sure that it will be admitted that the last forty years have seen a\r\nvast improvement in the character of attendants, and among them are to\r\nbe found many conscientious, trustworthy men and women, forbearing to\r\ntheir charge and loyal to their superintendent. It is not the less true\r\nthat for asylums for the middle and higher classes the addition of\r\ncompanionship of a more educated character is desirable, and it is\r\nsatisfactory to observe that there is an increasing recognition of its\r\nimportance, as evidenced by the Reports of our asylums.[303]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne word now in regard to the advance in our classification of mental\r\ndisorders, though I hardly dare to even touch thus lightly upon so\r\ndelicate a subject, for I have observed that it is one of those\r\nquestions in our department of medicine--dry and unexciting as it may\r\nat first sight seem to be--which possess a peculiar polemical charm.\r\n\r\nFew circumstances are more noteworthy than the attacks which have been\r\nmade upon the citadel of the Pinel-Esquirol classification, the\r\nsymptomatological expression of the disease--attacks not new forty years\r\nago, but renewed with great force and spirit by Luther Bell in America,\r\nand subsequently by Schroeder van der Kolk in Holland, Morel in France,\r\nand Skae in Britain. When Dr. Bell asserted that this system of symptoms\r\n\"would not bear the test of accuracy as regards the cause of the disease\r\nor the pathological condition of the sufferer;\" that the forms in use\r\n\"were merely the changing external symptoms, often having scarcely a\r\ndiurnal continuance before passing from one to another,\" and\r\nconstituting a division useless as regards moral or medical\r\ntreatment--he expressed in a nutshell all the objections since urged\r\nagainst the orthodox classification by the other alienists I have\r\nmentioned. These, however, substituted a mixed aetiological or\r\npathogenetic classification, which Bell did not, and this classification\r\nis, in its essential characters, on its trial to-day. The wave of\r\nthought which bore these attempts to the surface, was a wholesome\r\nindication of the desire to look beneath the mere symptom right down to\r\nthe physical state which occasioned it, and upon which the somatic\r\nschool of German alienists had long before laid so much stress. The\r\nmovement has been useful, if for no other reason than that it has\r\nconcentrated attention afresh and more definitely upon the conditions\r\nwhich may stand in causal relation with the mental disorder, nor has it\r\nbeen without its influence in affecting the terms generally employed in\r\nthe nomenclature of insanity. At the same time it is very striking to\r\nobserve how the great types of mental disorder adopted and in part\r\nintroduced by the great French alienists have essentially held their\r\nground, and if their citadel has had in some points to parley with a\r\nfoeman worthy of their steel, and even treat with him as an honourable\r\nrival, they remain still in possession, and their classification of\r\nsymptoms seems likely to remain there for long to come. As such, these\r\ntypes are partly founded upon clinical and, to some extent, pathological\r\nobservation, and may well be allowed with a few additional forms to\r\nstand side by side with a somato-aetiological nomenclature, as it grows\r\nup slowly and cautiously, reared on scientific observation and research;\r\nand had Skae been living he would have rejoiced to hear Mr. Hutchinson\r\nassert the other day that in all diseases, \"our future classification\r\nmust be one of causes and not external symptoms, if we would desire to\r\nconstruct anything like a natural system, and trace the real relation of\r\ndiseases to their origin.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a sketch, however brief, of the progress of Psychological Medicine\r\nsince the foundation of this Association in 1841, it would be a serious\r\nomission not to notice the important contributions of the late Professor\r\nLaycock shortly before as well as after that year. In 1840 he first\r\npromulgated the opinion that \"the brain, although the organ of\r\nconsciousness, is subject to the laws of reflex action, and in this\r\nrespect does not differ from other ganglia of the nervous system.\"[304]\r\nAnd in a paper read before the British Association, September, 1844, he\r\nobserved, \"Insanity and dreaming present the best field for\r\ninvestigating the laws of that extension of action from one portion of\r\nthe brain to the other, by which ideas follow each other in sequence,\r\ngiving as an illustration the case of a patient at the York Retreat,\r\nwhose will being suspended, he expressed ideas as they spontaneously\r\narose in associated sequence, the combination being singularly varied,\r\nbut traceable to a common root or centre of impulse.\" \"Researches of\r\nthis kind,\" Laycock continues, \"whether instituted on the insane, the\r\nsomnambulist, the dreamer, or the delirious, must be considered like\r\nresearches in analytical chemistry. The re-agent is the impression made\r\non the brain; the molecular changes following the applications of the\r\nre-agent are made known to us as ideas.\"[305]\r\n\r\nTime will not allow me to cite other passages in these remarkable\r\npapers, or later ones; but these are sufficient to show the germ at that\r\nearly period of the doctrine of cerebral reflex action, and the\r\nunconscious cerebration of Carpenter, the seeds having been already sown\r\nby Unzer and Prochaska, and arising out of it, that of automatic states\r\noccasioned or permitted by the abeyance of a higher restraining\r\npower--the Will, according to Laycock, in the case he employs as an\r\nillustration of his doctrine. His teaching in regard to mental and\r\nnervous disorders due to vaso-motor disturbance also deserves\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nDr. Henry Monro, again, in a treatise published in 1851, put forward a\r\ntheory of the pathology of insanity, the essence of which was that the\r\ncerebral masses having lost their static equilibrium exhibit in their\r\nfunctions two different degrees of deficient nervous action\r\n(coincidently), viz. irritable excess of action and partial paralysis.\r\nHe maintained that these two states do not fall alike upon all the seats\r\nof mental operations, but that there is \"a partial suspension of action\"\r\nof \"higher faculties, such as reason and will,\" while there is an\r\nirritable excess of action of the seats of the more elementary\r\nfaculties, such as conception, etc., and hence delusions and the\r\nexcessive rapidity of successive ideas. Dr. Monro compares this\r\ncondition to a case of paralysis, combined with convulsions; and\r\ndiscusses the question whether the temporary and partial paralysis\r\noccurring as he supposes in insanity, \"results directly and entirely\r\nfrom excessive depression of the nervous centres of those higher\r\nfaculties, or partly in an _indirect_ manner from nervous energy being\r\nabstracted to other parts which are in more violent exercise at the\r\ntime.\"[306]\r\n\r\nThis, it will be seen, is a still clearer statement of the doctrine that\r\ninsanity is caused by the depression or paralysis of the higher nervous\r\ncentres and excessive action of others.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, Dr. Hughlings Jackson, whose views regarding active\r\nstates of nerve structures as liberations of energy or discharges, are\r\nfamiliar to us all, has adopted and extended Laycock's doctrine, which\r\nhe designates as \"one of inestimable value,\" and has urged the\r\nimportance of Monro's doctrine of negative and positive states in cases\r\nof insanity, using the term \"insanity\" in an exceedingly wide sense. He\r\nhas pointed out that Anstie and Thompson Dickson have also stated the\r\ndoctrine that so-called \"exaltation of faculties\" in many morbid states\r\nis owing to \"insubordination from loss of control,\" and that the same\r\nwas said in effect by Symonds, of Bristol. Adopting the hypothesis of\r\nevolution as enunciated by Herbert Spencer, Dr. Hughlings Jackson thinks\r\nthat cases of insanity, and indeed all other nervous diseases, may be\r\nconsidered as examples of Dissolution, this being, I need not say, the\r\nterm Spencer uses for the process which is the reverse of Evolution.\r\nInsanity, then, according to this view, is dissolution beginning at the\r\nhighest cerebral centres, which centres, according to Jackson, represent\r\nor re-represent the whole organism. There are distinguishable, he\r\nbelieves, cases of uniform dissolution, the process affecting the\r\nhighest centres nearly uniformly, and cases of partial dissolution in\r\nwhich only some parts of these centres are affected. The dissolution,\r\nagain, whether uniform or partial, varies in \"depth;\" the deeper it is,\r\nthe more general are the manifestations remaining possible. The degree\r\nof \"depth\" of dissolution is, however, but one factor in this\r\ncomparative study of insanity. Another is the rapidity with which it is\r\neffected. To this, Dr. Jackson attaches extreme importance, believing\r\nthat degrees of it account for degrees of activity of those nervous\r\narrangements next lower than those _hors de combat_ in the dissolution.\r\nAnother factor is the kind of person to whom dissolution \"comes.\" And\r\nthe last factor is the influence of circumstances on the patient\r\nundergoing mental dissolution. All factors should, of course, be\r\nconsidered in each case, or, as Dr. Jackson characteristically puts it,\r\n\"insanity is a function of four variables.\" I refer to these opinions to\r\nshow the direction in which some modern speculation on the nature of\r\ninsanity tends, that thus tracing the course of thought in recent years\r\nwe may see how, step by step, certain views have been reached, some of\r\nthem generally adopted, others regarded as still requiring proof before\r\nthey can be accepted.\r\n\r\nThe negative and positive view of the nature of insanity receives\r\nsupport, I think, from the phenomena of Hypnotism which, about forty\r\nyears ago, attracted, under the name of Mesmerism, so much attention in\r\nEngland in consequence of the proceedings of Dr. Elliotson in the\r\nhospital and college where we meet to-day. This was in 1838, and Braid's\r\nattention was arrested by what he witnessed in 1841. It is no reason\r\nbecause we have re-christened mesmerism that we should ignore the merit\r\nof those who, as to matters of fact, were in the right, however mistaken\r\ntheir interpretation may have been.\r\n\r\nElliotson recorded some striking examples of induced hallucinations and\r\ndelusions, and in an article in the _Journal_ in 1866, I endeavoured to\r\nshow how suggestive similar instances which I then reported are in\r\nrelation to certain forms of insanity, and also in relation to sudden\r\nrecovery from mental disease; the conclusion being forced upon us that\r\nthere may be cases in which no change takes place in the brain which the\r\nablest microscopist is likely to detect, but a dynamic change--one more\r\nor less temporary in the relative functional power of different cerebral\r\ncentres, involving loss or excess of inhibition.\r\n\r\nNor can I, in connection with the reference to cerebral localization,\r\nallow to pass unrecorded the researches of Fritsch, Hitzig, and Ferrier,\r\non account of the intimate, although only partial relation in which they\r\nstand to mental pathology--a relation promising to become more\r\nintelligible and therefore more important as the true meaning of the\r\npsycho-motor centres becomes better understood; for that we are only on\r\nthe threshold of this inquiry must be evident, when men like Goltz,\r\nMunk, and other investigators call in question the conclusions which\r\nhave been arrived at.\r\n\r\nBut be the final verdict what it may, when I look back to the time when\r\n\"Solly on the Brain\" was our standard work, and then turn to Ferrier's\r\ntreatise on its functions, to the remarkable works of Luys, and to Dr.\r\nBastian's valuable contribution to the International Series, I cannot\r\nbut feel how unquestionable has been the advance made in the physiology\r\nof the brain, strangely bent as Nature is on keeping her secrets\r\nwhenever the wonderful nexus which binds together, yet confounds not,\r\nmind and brain, is the subject of investigation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe past forty years have witnessed a great change in the recognition of\r\nmental disease as an integral part of disorders of the nervous system,\r\nand medical psychology is less and less regarded as a fragment detached\r\nfrom the general domain of medicine. Contributions from all lands have\r\nconspired to produce this effect, the somatic school of psychologists in\r\nGermany having exerted, probably, the most influence. And we are proud\r\nto number in France among our roll of associates a physician who, not\r\nonly by his pathological researches into diseases of the brain and cord,\r\nbut by his clinical study of affections closely allied to mental\r\nderangement, has by the brilliant light he has thrown upon the whole\r\nrange of diseases of the nervous system, advanced the recognition of\r\nwhich I have just spoken. I need not say that I refer to our\r\ndistinguished honorary member, Professor Charcot.\r\n\r\nNo one will deny that the relations of mind and brain, physiologically\r\nand pathologically considered, have in our own country been ably handled\r\nby Dr. Maudsley. Those who most widely differ from some of his\r\nconclusions will acknowledge this ability, and that his works are\r\nexpressed in language which, with this author, is certainly not employed\r\nto conceal his thoughts. To trace the influence of these writings, and\r\nthose of Herbert Spencer, Bain, and others of the same school, on the\r\ncurrent belief of psychologists would, however, carry me far beyond the\r\nlegitimate limits of an address, but I may be allowed to observe that\r\nhere, as elsewhere, we must not confound clearly ascertained facts in\r\nbiology and mental evolution with the theories which are elaborated from\r\nthem. The former will remain; the latter may prove perishable hay and\r\nstubble, and when we overlook or ignore this distinction, it must be\r\nadmitted that we expose ourselves to the just rebuke of the celebrated\r\nProfessor of Berlin when he protests against \"the attempts that are made\r\nto proclaim the problems of research as actual facts, the opinion of\r\nscientists as established science, and thereby to put in a false light\r\nbefore the eyes of the less informed masses, not merely the methods of\r\nscience, but also its whole position in regard to the intellectual life\r\nof men and nations.\" He is surely right when he insists that if we\r\nexplain attraction and repulsion as exhibitions of mind, we simply throw\r\nPsyche out of the window and Psyche ceases to be Psyche;[307] and when,\r\nallowing that it is easy to say that a cell consists of minute\r\nparticles, and these we call plastidules, that plastidules are composed\r\nof carbon and hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and are endued with a special\r\nsoul, which soul is the product of some of the forces which the chemical\r\natom possesses, he affirms that this is one of those positions which is\r\nstill unapproachable, adding, \"I feel like a sailor who puts forth into\r\nan abyss, the extent of which he cannot see;\" and, again, \"I must enter\r\nmy decided protest against the attempt to make a premature extension of\r\nour doctrine in this manner--never ceasing to repeat a hundred-fold a\r\nhundred times, 'Do not take this for established truth.'\"[308]\r\n\r\nWe all believe in cerebral development according to what we call natural\r\nlaws or causes, and in the parallel phenomena of mind; as also in the\r\narrested and morbid action of brain-power by infractions of laws or by\r\ncauses no less natural. In this sense we are all evolutionists. The\r\ndifferences of opinion arise when the ultimate relations of matter and\r\nmind are discussed, and when a designing force at the back of these laws\r\nis debated. But these questions in their relation to mental evolution,\r\nas to evolution in general, do not enter the domain of practical\r\nscience, and are not affected by the degree of remoteness, according to\r\nour human reckoning, of this force or \"Ultimate Power.\"\r\n\r\nIt will not be denied that at least the foundations of the pathology of\r\ninsanity have been more securely laid in cerebral physiology during the\r\nlast forty years, in spite of the fact that the relation of the minute\r\nstructure of the brain to its functions, and the nature of the force in\r\noperation, still elude our grasp. The so-called disorders of the mind\r\nhaving been brought within the range of the pathologist, what can he\r\ntell us now of the post-mortem lesions of the insane? Can he give a\r\nsatisfactory reply to the question asked by Pinel in his day, \"Is it\r\npossible to establish any relation between the physical appearances\r\nmanifested after death, and the lesions of intellectual function\r\nobserved during life?\"[309]\r\n\r\nIt is a little more than forty years since Lelut published his work\r\nentitled \"The Value of Cerebral Alterations in Acute Delirium and\r\nInsanity,\" and Parchappe his \"Recherches,\" to be followed by other works\r\ncontaining valuable contributions to the pathological anatomy of mental\r\ndisease. To attempt to enumerate the contributions to this department\r\nabroad and at home would be simply impossible on the present occasion. I\r\ncannot, however, omit to notice how early Dr. Bucknill was in the field,\r\nas his laborious examination of a number of brains of the insane to\r\ndetermine the amount of cerebral atrophy and the specific gravity, bear\r\nwitness, as also his demonstration of the changes which take place, not\r\nonly in the brain and its membranes, but in the cord, in general\r\nparalysis; these observations, along with those of Dr. Boyd, having been\r\nfully confirmed by subsequent observers.\r\n\r\nI recall here, with interest, a visit I paid eight and twenty years ago\r\nto Schroeder van der Kolk at Utrecht, whom I found full of enthusiasm\r\n(although racked at the time with neuralgia) in the midst of his\r\nmicroscopical sections. And this enthusiasm I cannot but suspect\r\ninsensibly coloured what he saw in the brains and cords of the insane,\r\nor he would hardly have said, as he did say, that he had never failed\r\nduring a quarter of a century to find a satisfactory explanation after\r\ndeath of the morbid mental phenomena observed during life.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be forgotten that Parchappe, just forty years ago,\r\nwas able to speak as strongly in regard to the brains of general\r\nparalytics; and that of others he said that it would be nearer the truth\r\nto assert that you can, than that you cannot, distinguish between a sane\r\nand an insane brain.\r\n\r\nSince that period microscopes of higher power have been sedulously\r\nemployed by European and American histologists, and in our country the\r\nexample set by Lockhart Clarke has been followed by many able and\r\nsuccessful investigators. I had intended to enumerate in some detail the\r\ngains of pathological anatomy in cerebro-mental diseases, and to\r\nendeavour to apportion to those who have cultivated this field of\r\nresearch their respective merits; but I find it better to consider what\r\nis the practical result of these researches. I may, however, so far\r\ndepart from this course as to mention the memoirs of Dr. J. B. Tuke in\r\nthe _Edinburgh Medical Journal_ of 1868 and 1869, and elsewhere, on\r\naccount of their importance in the history of the morbid histology of\r\ninsanity.\r\n\r\nReturning to the practical question of the knowledge now possessed by\r\nthe cerebral pathologist, I will put into the witness box Professor\r\nWestphal and Dr. Herbert Major, as having enjoyed and utilized large\r\nopportunities for making microscopic and macroscopic examinations of the\r\ninsane, and not being hasty--some think the former too slow--to admit\r\nthe presence of distinctive lesions.\r\n\r\nNow, Professor Westphal informs me that he is unable to trace, in the\r\nmajority of post-mortems of the insane who have not suffered from\r\ngeneral paralysis, any morbid appearance of the brain or its membranes,\r\neither with the naked eye or the microscope. He maintains that it would\r\nbe impossible to designate amongst a hundred miscellaneous brains those\r\nwhich have belonged to insane persons, if the cases of general paralysis\r\nhad been eliminated.\r\n\r\nDr. Major speaks guardedly; but inclines to think that, even putting\r\naside general paralytics, the sane may be _generally_ distinguished from\r\nthe insane brain. His experience at Wakefield shows that in only\r\nseventeen per cent. of the autopsies (excluding general paralysis) the\r\nbrain showed no decided morbid change. \"It must be always remembered,\"\r\nDr. Major writes, \"that the difficulty is not to distinguish between the\r\ninsane brain on the one hand and a perfectly healthy and vigorous sane\r\nbrain on the other--the difference between these two extremes is, in my\r\nown experience, most striking and startling. The difficulty is to\r\ndistinguish between the insane brain and that of an individual sane, but\r\nin whom the brain is (as in time it may be) anaemic, wasted, or even\r\nwith tracts of softening. Still,\" he adds, \"I think, generally speaking,\r\nthe sane organ may be distinguished from the insane, the decision\r\nturning largely on the _degree_ of the degenerative or other morbid\r\nchange.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, taking only cases of general paralysis, Professor Westphal holds\r\nthat in by far the greater number of brains of insane persons dying in\r\nan advanced stage, morbid appearances similar to those which he has\r\ndescribed in Griesinger's \"Archiv. I.,\" etc., can be traced; the morbid\r\nappearances of the cord occurring more constantly than those of the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nDr. Major found that of the post-mortems of paralytics, all displayed\r\nappreciable morbid lesions, although in five per cent. of cases they\r\nwere not typical of general paralysis.\r\n\r\nThen coming definitely to the question whether these pathologists have,\r\nto any considerable extent, been able to connect the morbid appearances\r\nfound in cases of insanity with the symptoms, including motor troubles,\r\nDr. Major says that at present he cannot; and Professor Westphal says\r\nthat he regards \"the connection of morbid symptoms with the changes\r\nfound after death as exceedingly uncertain and doubtful.\"\r\n\r\nI should observe that Dr. Major grounds his statements upon his own\r\nrecent experience and observation at Wakefield, and that he is not\r\ndisputing the greater preference shown by certain lesions in general\r\nparalysis for particular localities; but only that he does not yet see\r\nhis way to connect them with the abnormal symptoms present during life.\r\nThe researches carried on by Dr. Mickle, contributed to our _Journal_\r\n(January, 1876), and those of Dr. Crichton Browne, published with\r\nillustrations in the \"West Riding Reports,\" must be regarded along with\r\nM. Voisin's large work and Hitzig's article in Ziemssen's \"Cyclopaedia,\"\r\nas placing before us whatever evidence can be adduced on the relations\r\nbetween the pathology of general paralysis and cerebral physiology.\r\nHitzig, who from his investigations into the cerebral motor centres,\r\nand his position in an asylum for the insane, ought to be qualified to\r\njudge, surmises that those localities of the brain by the electrical\r\nirritation of which in animals he produced epileptiform attacks bearing\r\nthe closest resemblance to the attacks of paralytics, are affected in\r\ngeneral paralysis. He thinks, moreover, that as destruction of these\r\ncortical spots causes disturbance of motion, resembling the symptoms\r\npathognomonic of grey degeneration of the posterior columns observed in\r\ngeneral paralysis, there is an added reason for assuming this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nDr. Mickle in his recent excellent work on general paralysis has\r\nexercised much cautious discrimination in admitting the relation between\r\nthe symptoms and the alleged psycho-motor centres, and while his\r\nresearches in a rich field of observation at the Grove Hall Asylum lead\r\nhim to find some cerebral lesion in every case, especially in the\r\nfronto-parietal region, he cautions against the \"too ready indictment of\r\nmotor centres in the cerebral cortex as answerable for the most frequent\r\nand characteristic motor impairment, that of the lips, tongue, face, and\r\narticulatory organs generally;\" fully believing, however, that in the\r\nproduction of these symptoms the cortical lesion is at the very least an\r\nimportant factor. \"Whether the principal mental symptoms can be entirely\r\nreferred,\" he says, \"to the organic changes in certain frontal (and\r\nparietal) convolutions--the motor to those of the so-called cortical\r\nmotor zone--the sensory to those of certain portions of the\r\ntemporo-sphenoidal and parietal--must remain a matter of question,\"\r\nwhile in regard to the convulsive attacks, Dr. Mickle has in some cases\r\nbeen \"unable to trace a harmony between these and the results of\r\nphysiological experiment; in other cases they have seemed to harmonize\r\nfairly.\"[310] Dr. Mickle informs me that in the insane other than\r\ngeneral paralytics, he has in the majority found some lesion in the\r\nbrain and membranes.[311]\r\n\r\nThese results of research in cerebro-mental pathological anatomy and\r\nphysiology may not seem, when placed side by side with the sanguine\r\nopinions of Schroeder van der Kolk and Parchappe, to present so\r\ntriumphant a proof of progress and solid gain as might be desired or\r\nexpected, and much, we must admit, has to be done before Pinel's\r\nquestion can be answered with the fulness we should wish. Nevertheless\r\nthe advance is very considerable, and the best proof of the accumulating\r\nknowledge of the morbid histology of the brain and cord in the insane\r\nwill, I think, be given this week by the collection of microscopical\r\npreparations of Gudden, Holler, etc., brought together by the untiring\r\nenergy of Dr. Savage, including his own at Bethlem Hospital. I have but\r\nto point out how impossible such an exhibition would have been forty\r\nyears ago to give significance to the contrast between 1841 and 1881;\r\nthanks to those who, although they may still often see as \"through a\r\nglass darkly,\" have so wonderfully advanced the application of\r\nmicroscopic examination to the tissue of the brain, and prepared such\r\nbeautiful sections of diseased brain and cord.\r\n\r\nAnother proof of progress might have been given, had time allowed of a\r\nreference to what has been done in the study of the brains of idiots,\r\nboth morphologically and histologically, by Mierzejewski, Luys, and\r\nothers, these results being sufficient to prove, had we no other\r\nevidence, the fundamental truth of cerebro-mental pathology--the\r\ndependence of healthy mind on healthy brain.\r\n\r\nWe are surely justified in expecting that by a prolonged examination of\r\nevery part of the brain structure, and the notation of the mental\r\nsymptoms, we shall arrive in future at more definite results; that the\r\nlocality of special disorders will be discovered, and that the\r\ncorrelation of morbid mental and diseased cerebral states will become\r\nmore and more complete, that the scientific classification of mental\r\nmaladies may be one day based upon pathological as well as clinical\r\nknowledge, and psychology be founded, in part at least, upon our\r\nacquaintance with the functions of the brain. Let us hope, also, even\r\nthough it be a hope in the sense rather of desire than of expectation,\r\nthat by these discoveries the successful treatment of mental disorders\r\nmay be proportionately advanced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI would now turn to the very important question whether the treatment\r\nof the insane has advanced since 1841?\r\n\r\nOf course, so far as this includes moral treatment and management, it\r\nhas advanced in all civilized countries in a manner calculated, all will\r\nadmit, to cause the liveliest feelings of satisfaction. Putting aside\r\n_moral_ treatment, we cannot boast, it must be confessed, of the same\r\nunanimity of judgment. If, however, it must be admitted that as respects\r\ndetails, _Tot capita, tot sensus_, it will be allowed that,\r\nnotwithstanding the so many heads, and the as many opinions, the general\r\nprinciples of treatment based upon a just view of the general pathology\r\nof insanity, are accepted by all. There were too many who, forty years\r\nago, bled freely for mania, and I remember Conolly, at even a later\r\nperiod, complaining of the number of patients brought to him hopelessly\r\ndemented in consequence of the heroic treatment to which, when maniacal,\r\nthey had been subjected by men who, no doubt, still believed with\r\nParacelsus when he said, \"What avails in mania except opening a vein?\r\nThen the patient will recover. This is the arcanum. Not camphor, not\r\nsage and marjoram, not clysters, not this, not that, but phlebotomy.\"\r\nWell, this treatment by the Paracelsuses of 1841 has been supplanted by\r\nthe more rational therapeutics which we witness in 1881.\r\n\r\nDr. Stokes, the highly respected superintendent of the Mount Hope\r\nRetreat, Baltimore, thus writes in his last annual report: \"Forty years\r\nago, when this institution was opened, large blood-lettings--in the\r\nstanding, recumbent, or sitting posture, to the amount of thirty or\r\nforty ounces--were recommended in acute mania, followed up by local\r\ndepletion, by leeches, to the number of twenty or thirty, to the\r\ntemples. The moral treatment, hygienic measures, exercise, and suitable\r\noccupation were almost wholly ignored. Drastic purgatives, ... the\r\nshower bath, large and frequent doses of tartarized antimony, and\r\nmercury to the extent of producing ptyalism, were the most popular\r\nremedial agents in the treatment of insanity. This, in general terms,\r\nwas the system advocated and practised when, forty years ago, this\r\ninstitution entered upon its godlike mission.\"\r\n\r\nIf the success of the treatment of insanity bore any considerable\r\nproportion to the number of the remedies which have been brought\r\nforward, it would be my easy and agreeable duty to record the triumphs\r\nof medicine in the distressing malady which they are employed to combat.\r\nBut this, unhappily, is not the case. Hypodermic injections of morphia,\r\nthe administration of the bromides, chloral hydrate, hyoscyamine,\r\nphysostigma, cannabis indica, amyl nitrite, conium, digitalis, ergot,\r\npilocarpine, the application of electricity, the use of the Turkish bath\r\nand the wet pack, and other remedies too numerous to mention, have had\r\ntheir strenuous advocates during late years. Each remedy, however, let\r\nus hope, leaves a certain residuum of usefulness behind it, though\r\nfailing to fulfil all the hopes raised on its first trial.\r\n\r\nDr. Ramskill lately avowed his opinion in my hearing that the advent of\r\nthe bromide has done infinite mischief. Others, attacking chloral, would\r\nmaintain that while the bromide has slain its thousands, chloral hydrate\r\nhas slain its tens of thousands. In spite of this, however, Dr.\r\nRamskill, doubtless, continues to employ the bromide; and who would wish\r\nto be deprived of chloral, or any other drug, because of its abuse?\r\n\r\n    \"For nought so vile that on the earth doth live,\r\n     But to the earth some special good doth give;\r\n     Nor aught so good, but strained from that fair use,\r\n     Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\"\r\n\r\nEmployed without discrimination, regarded as a talisman in insomnia and\r\nexcitement--petted, in short, when it ought to have been\r\nrestrained--chloral became for a time the spoilt child of psychological\r\nmedicine, and, like other spoilt children, it has disappointed the fond\r\nhopes of its parents.\r\n\r\nWhen it is possible for a physician in asylum practice to write as Dr.\r\nPritchard Davies has written this year in our _Journal_, \"On Chemical\r\nRestraint,\" to the effect that chloral, the bromides, and other\r\nsedatives are unnecessary, or even injurious; when, on the other hand,\r\nwe have Dr. Hills replying that his experience at the Norfolk Asylum\r\nleads him to an entirely opposite conclusion; and Dr. Stokes, in\r\nAmerica, writing thus in his report, after 7425 patients have been under\r\ntreatment in his asylum, \"without wishing to undervalue the great\r\nimportance of an efficient system of moral treatment, great results can\r\nonly be expected from a patient and persevering administration of\r\npowerful remedial agencies\"--I say when such contrary opinions can be\r\nexpressed by practical men, one feels how impossible it is to dogmatize\r\nupon the good effected by pharmaceutical remedies in insanity, and how\r\nfar we are yet from witnessing a consensus of opinion in regard to their\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIt must be frankly granted that Psychological Medicine can boast, as\r\nyet, of no specifics, nor is it likely, perhaps, that such a boast will\r\never be made. It may be difficult to suppress the hope, but we cannot\r\nentertain the expectation, that some future Sydenham will discover an\r\nanti-psychosis which will as safely and speedily cut short an attack of\r\nmania or melancholia as bark an attack of ague.\r\n\r\nRather must we rest satisfied with the general advance in treatment in a\r\nscientific direction. Most of us know asylums where, within forty years\r\nand much less, tartarized antimony was in daily use in large doses as a\r\nquietus, and where croton oil was administered in addition to black\r\ndraughts to a surprising extent, all these remedies being now employed\r\nonly on the rarest occasions. Take an actual example, one of many, in a\r\nparticular asylum. A few years ago a patient, who had been much excited\r\nand very troublesome, was treated in season and out of season with\r\nstrong purgatives and sedatives. It so happened that he then fell under\r\na new _regime_, which consisted in knocking off all these medicines and\r\nplacing him under one attendant's entire supervision. The result was\r\nthat he became as quiet and docile, though not cured, as any of the\r\ninmates of the asylum, and has remained so to the present time. But we\r\nmay go further, and say that some cases of insanity are cured now which\r\na few years ago would have remained uncured. Indeed, in relation to the\r\nassociated bodily state, it may be said that specific treatment has been\r\nadopted. Remedies, like iodide of potassium, in large doses, are\r\nemployed in cases in which, from the increased attention directed in\r\nrecent years to the somatic aetiology of insanity, a causal relation\r\nbetween the physical and mental condition has been recognized, and the\r\nmental symptoms have disappeared in the most marked manner; and so again\r\nin gouty melancholia, relief has been obtained by appropriate remedies\r\nand diet. These are illustrations of the directly scientific application\r\nof medicine to medical psychology, and it is in this direction we must\r\nhope for a really satisfactory advance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are the successes obtained by the employment of\r\ndrugs without our being able to say why or how they have exerted a\r\ncurative agency; and it is obvious that as the number of drugs has so\r\nmuch increased during the period over which my survey extends, the\r\nchances of hitting on the right remedy are proportionately increased.\r\nHow often we see one, two, or three drugs exhibited in mania without any\r\nresult, while a fourth acts like a charm. Only by studying in detail the\r\nspecial characteristics of each case, can we hope to find a clue which\r\nwill serve as a guide to the treatment of a subsequent one.\r\n\r\nIn this country, Dr. Clouston has distinctly advanced our knowledge of\r\nthe action and uses of narcotic remedies by experiments made to\r\ndetermine the effect on maniacal excitement of single doses of certain\r\nremedies, stimulants, and food; of, again, the effect on mania of\r\nprolonged courses of certain narcotic medicines, along with clinical\r\nobservations on the effects of the same medicines in all kinds of\r\ninsanity, and has determined the equivalent value of opium, bromide of\r\npotassium, and cannabis indica in the treatment of insanity.\r\n\r\nDr. Savage has experimented with one drug at a time on a number of\r\npatients, and has already given to the profession some valuable results\r\nin \"Guy's Hospital Reports,\" and the _Journal of Mental Science_. \"The\r\nWest Riding Asylum Medical Reports\" of Dr. Crichton Browne also contain\r\nsome important experiments with drugs by himself and others; and in this\r\nconnection I would notice the excellent clinical notes issued from time\r\nto time by Dr. Williams and other officers of the Haywards Heath Asylum,\r\nwhich are well worthy of more permanent record in the archives of the\r\nAssociation. I cannot, indeed, understand any one seriously maintaining\r\nthat we are practically no better off in our medicinal resources now\r\nthan we were forty years ago.\r\n\r\nWhatever differences of opinion may exist in regard to the advantages\r\ngained by the introduction of new drugs, one thing is clear, that the\r\nemployment and, let me add, the repose of patients, well-ordered\r\narrangements, and the tact of the superintendent will oftentimes do more\r\nto reduce the amount of excitement and noise in an asylum than tons of\r\nchloral and bromide. For example, any one who has visited Hanwell knows\r\nthat Dr. Rayner anticipates and prevents post-epileptic mania to a very\r\nlarge extent by the simple expedient of keeping patients in bed after\r\ntheir fits, just as he finds forced alimentation of patients rarely\r\nnecessary when rest is resorted to. It is striking to see how, even in\r\nan over-grown asylum and an old building, the results of good management\r\nand treatment can be highly satisfactory, and worthy of an institution\r\nof such historic fame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the question faces us, are there or are there not more\r\ninsane persons cured in 1881 than in 1841?\r\n\r\nOne's first impulse, of course, is to take the statistics of recovery\r\nfor a certain number of the more recent, and compare them with those of\r\nthe earlier years, or to take the recoveries of the past forty and place\r\nthem side by side with those of the previous forty years. The attempt,\r\nhowever, is fraught with so many fallacies that it is dangerous to make\r\nsuch a comparison. In a report of Bethlem Hospital, issued in 1841, Sir\r\nAlexander Morison stated--not as anything exceptional--that seventy per\r\ncent. of the patients had been discharged cured; while an examination of\r\nthe recoveries at this hospital for the last ten years shows a much\r\nsmaller proportion per cent. But I cannot accept these comparisons as\r\nproving anything one way or the other, as various causes, quite apart\r\nfrom the comparative success of treatment at different periods, may\r\nexplain the difference. Take a single asylum, like Hanwell, and compare\r\nthe recoveries of a later with an earlier period. I find a population so\r\nfluctuating in character, in regard to curability, that the comparison\r\nbecomes utterly worthless, and although it is true that during the last\r\nquinquennium 28.1 per cent. have recovered, as against 26.3 per cent.\r\nduring the first quinquennium of the past forty years, in spite of there\r\nhaving been more incurables received during the later period, the result\r\nis not so satisfactory when we divide into certain periods the whole\r\ntime during which Hanwell has been open (omitting the first four years).\r\nIt then appears that during two previous periods the recoveries were\r\nhigher than 28.1 per cent., viz. from 1840 to 1849 and from 1865 to\r\n1874. Thus:--\r\n\r\n  1835-39 (inclusive)  25.3\r\n  1840-49              28.5\r\n  1850-54              25.2\r\n  1855-64              27.9\r\n  1865-74              30.4\r\n  1875-79              26.3\r\n\r\nOr in quinquennial periods throughout:--\r\n\r\n  1835-39 (inclusive)  24.8\r\n  1840-44              26.3\r\n  1845-49              32.1\r\n  1850-54              25.2\r\n  1855-59              30.7\r\n  1860-64              27.0\r\n  1865-69              30.4\r\n  1870-74              30.5\r\n  1875-79              26.3\r\n\r\nIf to escape the fallacies connected with the comparison of different\r\nperiods of the same asylum, we go to the Lunacy Blue Books, we do not\r\nget any reliable figures before 1870, on account of transfers having\r\nbeen previously included in the admissions, so that a fair comparison\r\nof recent and former recoveries worked on the admissions is impossible.\r\n\r\nI have before me the statistics of the Siegburg Asylum, thanks to Dr.\r\nRipping, from its opening to its close; and I find that the recoveries\r\nduring the first twenty-five years amounted to forty-two per cent., and\r\nduring the twenty-five years ending with the year 1877, they were\r\nforty-six per cent., thus showing an increase of four per cent. in the\r\nmore recent period. As this asylum, now closed, has admitted curable\r\ncases only, these figures are among the few valuable statistics which I\r\nhave been able to procure.\r\n\r\nI have not succeeded in obtaining satisfactory comparative results by\r\nadopting, in the mixed asylums of England and Wales, the plan of working\r\nthe recoveries, not on the total admissions, but on those only deemed\r\ncurable; but to explain this fully would involve me in more detail than\r\nthe occasion warrants.\r\n\r\nI would add that in the United States, where reasons have been assigned\r\nwhy the statistics of asylums exhibit apparently fewer recoveries in the\r\nlater than the earlier period of the last forty years, Dr. Pliny Earle\r\nhas done good service by the remarkable contribution he has made to the\r\nquestion of the curability of insanity,[312] corroborating, at the same\r\ntime, the somewhat unfavourable conclusion as to permanent recovery\r\nwhich Dr. Thurnam, in a work which will always be a Pharos to guide\r\nthose who sail on waters where so many are shipwrecked, arrived at,\r\nafter a laborious examination of the after history of cases discharged\r\nrecovered from the York Retreat. It is likewise anything but reassuring\r\nto find that, out of the total number of lunatics under care in England\r\nand Wales, there are at this moment only 3592 who are deemed\r\ncurable.[313]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch, gentlemen, is my Retrospect of the Past. Meagre it has necessarily\r\nbeen, though occupying more of your time than I could have wished, but\r\nthe number of subjects demanding reference must be my excuse.\r\n\r\nWe found, at the commencement of the period we have traversed, the\r\naccommodation provided for the insane scandalously insufficient, and the\r\ncondition of many of the existing asylums calling loudly for a radical\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nWe witness to-day, throughout the kingdom, a large number of\r\ninstitutions in admirable working order, reflecting the greatest credit\r\nupon their superintendents and committees.\r\n\r\nWe found a wholly inadequate system of inspection.\r\n\r\nWe witness now a Board of Commissioners, which, without forfeiting the\r\ngood will of the superintendents, carefully inspects the asylums\r\nthroughout the provinces as well as the metropolis--as carefully and\r\nthoroughly, at any rate, as the same number of men originally appointed\r\nto examine into the condition of some 20,000 patients can fulfil a like\r\nduty for above 70,000.\r\n\r\nWe found a resolute attempt being made to carry out and extend the\r\nhumane system of treatment inaugurated nearly half a century before in\r\nFrance and England.\r\n\r\nTo-day we witness its success.\r\n\r\nAnd had I had time to sketch the progress in the provision made for\r\ncriminal lunatics, we should have found that just forty years ago was\r\nthe commencement of what Dr. Nicolson has named the \"Reactionary\r\nPeriod\"--during which this Association petitioned the Government (in\r\n1851) to establish a criminal lunatic asylum--followed in 1860 by the\r\n\"Period of Centralization\" or that of Broadmoor--an institution to-day\r\nso efficiently superintended by Dr. Orange.\r\n\r\nAnd in what consists the superiority of the new over the old system of\r\ntreatment--the nineteenth over the eighteenth century?\r\n\r\nThe old system was mainly one of brute force--the child alike of\r\nignorance and fear.\r\n\r\nThe new does not indeed dispense with force, but it is a maxim of the\r\nreformed school, from which no one, whose opinion carries weight in\r\npsychological medicine, whether in America or in Europe, would dissent,\r\nthat it should be reduced to the lowest possible point, consistent with\r\nsafety and the good of the patient, and that humanity should dictate the\r\nmeans of repressing, or rather guarding against, violence, both as\r\nregards their amount and character.\r\n\r\nThe old system subjected patients, who underwent any medical treatment\r\nat all, to a miserable routine, often determined by the season of the\r\nyear and the phases of the moon, rather than the condition of the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nThe new does not pretend to possess a universal formula, or to have\r\ndiscovered the psychologist's stone, but strives to treat each patient\r\naccording to individual indications.\r\n\r\nThe old system desired secrecy; the new is not afraid of publicity.\r\n\r\nThe old system, in short, believed in harshness and darkness; the creed\r\nof the new is, \"I believe in sweetness and light.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the results achieved for Psychological Medicine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf this be the Retrospect of the Past, what is the Prospect of the\r\nFuture? Will the progress of the last forty or the last ninety years be\r\nmaintained? I trust it will, but one need not be a pessimist to be\r\nsensible that the humane treatment of the insane may have its ebb as\r\nwell as its flow; that so far from its being true that there is a\r\nconstant and certain tendency to humanity, there is also a strange\r\ntendency to relapse into inhuman ways. Vigilance is and always will be\r\nrequired, for if it be allowed to slumber, we but too well know that\r\nthere is only one direction in which things will go when left to\r\nthemselves--and that is downhill.\r\n\r\nThe functions--the mission--of this Association may be regarded from a\r\nthreefold point of view: first, in relation to insanity and the insane;\r\nsecondly, in relation to its members; thirdly, in relation to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nI.--Under the first are comprised what in the original rules, drawn up\r\nby the founders of this Association forty years ago, were stated to be\r\nits objects, namely, \"Improvement in the management of asylums and the\r\ntreatment of the insane;\" and further, \"The acquirement of a more\r\nextensive and more correct knowledge of insanity.\"\r\n\r\nAdded to the improved management of asylums is the necessity now for\r\nmaking appropriate provision for idiots and imbeciles, and their\r\neducation so far as practicable, grappling at the same time with the\r\nproblem how best to provide for the mass of incurable pauper patients in\r\nthe provinces, and the extension of middle-class asylums, and of\r\ncottages in connection with the central institution.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, various ways in which the welfare of the patients\r\nin asylums can be promoted, by the attention directed by the Association\r\nto special points of importance. To instance only one, the occupation of\r\npatients, including systematic teaching which Dr. Lalor has so\r\nsuccessfully developed in the Richmond Asylum, Dublin. Though very much\r\nhas been done, there is, all, I think, will agree, room for more\r\nsustained effort in this direction. \"There is one monster in the\r\nworld--the idle man,\" are the words of one who has lately passed beyond\r\nthe reach of praise or blame, which ought ever to be in the minds of\r\nthose who direct our asylums. It may be that if more were done in\r\nfuture in the spirit of this apophthegm of the Sage, if not the Saint,\r\nof Chelsea, there would be less chance of patients chewing the cud of\r\nbitter reflection and dwelling upon the delusions by which they are\r\nhaunted and harassed.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as we feel the inadequacy of our means of cure, we must\r\nrecognize the necessity of studying the aetiology of insanity, including\r\nthat _damnosa haereditas_, which is the cause of causes in so large a\r\nnumber of the cases coming under our treatment. But what induced the\r\nancestral taint? It behoves us to pay more and more attention to those\r\nlaws of inheritance in general to which Mr. Hutchinson has recently\r\ndirected attention in his suggestive lectures at the College of\r\nSurgeons.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Baillarger proposed that a similar association to this should be\r\nestablished in France, he gave, among other reasons, the advantage which\r\nwould accrue from discussing this very question. \"Every one,\" he said,\r\n\"is assuredly decided upon the influence of heredity in the production\r\nof insanity (Mr. Buckle had not then written); but in this primary\r\nquestion, how many secondary ones there are which remain unsolved.\"\r\nSince he thus wrote, his own countrymen, Morel and Lucas, have, by their\r\nresearches, advanced our knowledge, and rendered the task of their\r\nsuccessors in the same field easier.\r\n\r\nIntemperance also, as a cause as distinct from a symptom of insanity,\r\nrequires to be more thoroughly examined into, and I am happy to say Dr.\r\nHayes Newington, than whom no one could be better fitted for the task,\r\nhas prepared a series of questions arranged in a tabular form, which\r\nhas been before the Statistical Committee, and will appear in the\r\n_Journal_.\r\n\r\nAgain, there remains for the future the continued research into the\r\ncausal connection between certain mental symptoms or disorders and\r\naccompanying lesions of the brain and cord. Dr. Spitzka, of New York, in\r\nthe prize essay which he is about to publish, enters carefully into this\r\ninquiry, and I am hopeful that his industry and talent will be rewarded\r\nby marked success. These and kindred investigations might, no doubt, be\r\npursued in a more methodical manner than is always the case in English\r\nasylums. To this end, the appointment of a pathologist, as at Wakefield\r\nin our own country, and at the Utica Asylum in America, ought to become\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nClinical teaching in our asylums admits of much greater development,\r\nthough they may not be able to meet the demands made upon them, should\r\nexaminations be required in medical psychology by the examining bodies.\r\nTo-day the student has fortunately a very different position from that\r\nwhich fell to his lot forty years ago. He has at his command means of\r\nresearch then unknown, as the ophthalmoscope and sphygmograph, and all\r\nthe modern improvements in the microscope and in preparing sections; and\r\ncan he not experiment on knee jerks, and a host of reflex and electric\r\nphenomena never dreamt of by his predecessors? He has, moreover, the\r\nstimulus begotten of the sense that enough has been discovered to\r\nindicate how much precious treasure lies hidden beneath the ground he\r\nnow treads, like the gold-digger whose ardour is quickened and labour\r\nrepaid by the discovery of the minutest particle of the metal of which\r\nhe is in search.\r\n\r\nII. The second relation in which this Association stands--to its\r\nmembers--suggests that we must needs be alive to legislation affecting\r\nthe rights of those who are engaged in this department of medicine. This\r\nassociation is not a trades union, but there are various points bearing\r\non their position which have to be considered, as in connection with a\r\nBill like Mr. Dillwyn's, or the matters discussed two years ago at the\r\nannual meeting, when brought forward by Dr. Murray Lindsay. It is true\r\nthat for him who has taken mental science, in its widest sense, as his\r\nmistress; for him who has wooed her for her own sake, knowing full well\r\nthat for him she may hold no dowry in hand or pocket, there is the\r\nsupreme pleasure arising from study and observation themselves--that\r\nrecompense which is better than gold, and more precious than rubies. All\r\nthis is true; but none the less the superintendents of asylums have a\r\nright to expect not only that their services shall be adequately\r\nremunerated when in harness, but that they may count with certainty upon\r\na fair provision in the evening of life.\r\n\r\nIII. With regard, thirdly, to the influence of this Association on\r\npublic opinion, we should be strangely faithless to our mission, if we\r\nwere not the expositors of the principles in accordance with which the\r\ninsane ought to be regarded; if we did not endeavour to enlighten the\r\ncommunity in the doctrines of true psychological science, and in that\r\nphilanthropy which is as far asunder as the poles from the fitful\r\npseudo-philanthropy from which our country is unfortunately not free,\r\nthe wild, ill-regulated, hysterical clamour with which we are\r\nepidemically visited, as injurious to the lunatic as it is to the\r\ninterests of society at large.\r\n\r\nThis Association, further, ought to continue to bring before the lawyer\r\nwhat it regards as the just test of criminal responsibility; to entreat\r\nthe educator not to defeat the object of his noble profession by\r\nexactions which transgress the limits by which Nature has bounded human\r\ncapacity; and to warn parents, as Dr. Brigham did in his day with so\r\nmuch zeal, of the dangers to mental health arising from precocious\r\nforcing during the early growth of the brain, and with a tenfold greater\r\nnecessity than when he wrote, in presence of the illimitable folly of\r\nexamining boards, some of them medical, the members of which have not\r\neven the poor excuse of ignorance; and last, but not least, to counsel\r\nthe teacher of religion against the peculiar dangers which attend his\r\nexalted mission, remembering that--\r\n\r\n    \"Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied.\"\r\n\r\nVarious, then, are the functions of our Association. But what, asks the\r\nlate Sir James Stephen, the eloquent writer in the _Edinburgh_ is a\r\nparty, political or religious, without a Review? and he replies, \"A bell\r\nwithout a clapper.\" Such a bell would this Association have been without\r\nits _Journal_, and it must gratefully attribute much of its success to\r\nthe ability with which in the first instance Dr. Bucknill, and\r\nsubsequently Drs. Robertson, Maudsley, Sibbald, and Clouston, have\r\nhelped to make an otherwise clapperless bell articulate.\r\n\r\nThrough this organ of the Association, for which, speaking for my\r\ncolleague and myself, I would venture to ask your loyal co-operation,\r\nmuch scientific work can be brought before the profession, many\r\nquestions can be systematically discussed, and the invaluable experience\r\nof the superintendents of asylums on practical points be presented to\r\nits readers and permanently preserved.\r\n\r\nThe objects I have mentioned as calling for further attention, and many\r\nmore, belong to the future of Psychological Medicine, and as I began my\r\naddress with proposing to review the period bounded by the years 1841\r\nand 1881, I will close it with expressing the hope that when a successor\r\nof mine in this office reviews the then vanished period between 1881 and\r\n1921, he will be able to report an accelerated ratio of progress\r\ncompared with that of the time I have attempted, so inadequately, to\r\nsurvey.\r\n\r\nAnd may the Medico-Psychological Association, which I trust will always\r\nbe identified with this progress, be about to enter, after its\r\nwanderings, \"forty years long,\" a land flowing with milk and honey, won\r\nby conquests over ignorance, superstition, and cruelty--the triumphs of\r\nthe application of humanity and medical science to the relief of mental\r\nweakness and suffering.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[292] Presidential Address, delivered at the Annual Meeting of the\r\nMedico-Psychological Association, held at University College, London,\r\nAugust 2, 1881.\r\n\r\n[293] I here do homage to the dead. Calmeil, Baillarger, and Brierre de\r\nBoismont still live, at an advanced age. (Since this address was given,\r\nthe last named has died. See eloquent tribute to his memory by M. Motet,\r\nin _Journal of Mental Science_, April, 1882.)\r\n\r\n[294] As will be seen by the history of lunacy reform contained in this\r\nvolume, Lord Shaftesbury's interest in the movement extends back as far\r\nas 1828.\r\n\r\n[295] _American Journal of Insanity_, April, 1855.\r\n\r\n[296] 9 Geo.

In\r\nanother, degeneration and atrophy follow, the brain state conditioning\r\nacute insanity; and in another they are secondary to brain injury, not\r\nto mention many other groups.\r\n\r\n[312] In the same department the services of another American alienist,\r\nDr. Edward Jarvis, ought not to be forgotten. Among other works, his\r\nReport on the Idiotic and Insane in Massachusetts, 1854, was of great\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n[313] It is a remarkable fact, showing the mass of incurable cases\r\nwhich have accumulated, that the number of curable cases now is only\r\nabout 1000 more than it was in 1844 (2519).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn completing the task which the author has attempted in the foregoing\r\nchapters in the History of the Insane in the British Isles, he is only\r\ntoo conscious that, in the endeavour to be concise as well as\r\ncomprehensive, he has made many omissions. With every desire to be fair\r\nto all who have been engaged either in originating or in advancing the\r\nimproved treatment of those who, suffering cruelly from a malady\r\ninvolving their very nature and being, have also been treated cruelly by\r\ntheir fellows, the writer fears that some names which ought to have been\r\nrecorded and some institutions which ought to have been honourably\r\nmentioned, have been passed over in silence. Apart from unintentional\r\noversight, it is not always easy to find in the Temple of Fame the\r\nprecise niche in which to place the figure that would rightfully fill\r\nit, and the consequence is that the pedestal, as in some of our great\r\npublic edifices, remains unoccupied. It may be said, however, in\r\nextenuation of any such omission, that it did not fall within the scope\r\nof this book to chronicle all the establishments which, in more humane\r\nmethods of treatment, have been in advance of others, still less to\r\ncomplete the history up to the present day of those which have been\r\nmentioned. As it proceeded, the work has entered more into detail than\r\nwas originally designed; thus, in the chapter on Scotland the sketch is\r\nfilled in with particulars somewhat out of proportion to that attempted\r\nin the earlier chapters.\r\n\r\nAgain, in crediting various asylums, as Lincoln, Hanwell, and Lancaster,\r\nwith introducing non-restraint, the author has not found space for more\r\nthan a reference to the meritorious course pursued at an early period at\r\nthe Suffolk Asylum, the Gloucester Asylum, and at Northampton from its\r\nopening (1838), and at the Haslar Hospital.[314]\r\n\r\nThe writer would have been glad, had the proposed limits of the book\r\nadmitted of it, to describe much more fully the rise and growth of those\r\ncharitable institutions, the endowed or registered hospitals for the\r\ninsane, which have in England formed so important, and, on the whole, so\r\nsuccessful, an experiment in providing care and treatment for the insane\r\nof the poor but non-pauper class, supplemented as they have been by the\r\npayments of the rich. At the present moment, the principle and the\r\nmethod by which these institutions are governed attract much earnest\r\nattention, and appear to not a few to afford the best alternative\r\nprovision for the middle and upper classes, as against asylums carried\r\non by private enterprise. It may be so. Abuses which in former days were\r\npossible, could not occur under the legislative restrictions of our\r\ntime; but it must not be overlooked that their annals have disclosed,\r\nin some instances, abuses as great and inhumanities as shocking as any\r\nthat have disgraced the history of private houses. How abominably even\r\nsuch institutions have been managed, has already been depicted in a\r\nnotorious example; how admirably, might have been shown, had space\r\nallowed, as regards the same institution in the hands of men who, like\r\nDr. Needham, have maintained the reforms previously introduced within\r\nits once dishonoured walls, and carried forward that humane system of\r\ntreatment which, Phoenix-like, arose from its ashes. The author would\r\nhave liked to do justice to other hospitals--as that at Northampton,\r\nwhich under Dr. Bayley's remarkable power of organization has proved so\r\ngreat a success; that at Cheadle, which under Mr. Mould's exhaustless\r\nenergy has shown how the various needs of different phases of mental\r\ndisorder may be met by various modifications in the provision made for\r\ntheir care outside the walls of the asylum, thus combining cottage\r\ntreatment with the control of the central establishment; and, lastly,\r\nthat at Coton Hill, Stafford, which now and for many years has been\r\nsuperintended by Dr. Hewitson--an institution due to a wave of public\r\nfeeling in favour of an institution for those in reduced circumstances,\r\nwhich bore this practical fruit after some temporary discouragement.\r\n\r\nOf the work done by county asylum superintendents it is impossible to\r\nspeak too highly; in fact, it would be difficult to know when to stop,\r\nwere one to be mentioned. Superintendents of the vast asylums of\r\nMiddlesex, Lancashire, and Yorkshire deserve the recognition of\r\nservices performed day by day with faithful diligence, not always\r\nsufficiently appreciated, and not always without peril, as instanced in\r\nthe case of the late superintendent of Brookwood, Dr. Brushfield.[315]\r\n\r\nAs of those whose hourly labour is performed in these and other\r\ninstitutions, so of those who were labourers, however humble, in the\r\nearly days of asylum reform at the close of the last and the beginning\r\nof the present century, it must never be forgotten that work unobserved\r\nby the public eye, but conscientiously performed for the unfortunate\r\nclass which, to a large extent, is unable to appreciate or thank the\r\nkindly hand which shields them from cruelty or saves them from neglect,\r\nwill find its reward in the conscience; and also in the increased\r\nhappiness of those whom it benefits, though it may not set the worker on\r\nany pinnacle of fame. It is to such that the author of \"Romola\" refers\r\nwhen speaking of the \"valiant workers whose names are not registered\r\nwhere every day we turn the leaf to read them, but whose labours make a\r\npart, though an unrecognized part, of our inheritance, like the\r\nploughing and the sowing of past generations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[314] See Report of the Metropolitan Commissioners. 1844.\r\n\r\n[315] Since the above was in type, another example has occurred in the\r\ncase of Dr. Orange, who has been assaulted by a criminal lunatic, and\r\nnarrowly escaped serious injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n(Page 61.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the maps of Ralf Agas (cir. 1560?) and Braun and\r\nHogenberg (1572), there is an earlier view of London and Westminster by\r\nAnthony van der Wyngrede, 1543, in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, but it\r\nis worthless for the purpose of tracing the outline of Bethlem. No\r\nadditional light is thrown on the buildings by the view of London and\r\nWestminster in Norden's \"Speculum Brittanniae,\" engraved by Pieter van\r\ndem Keere, 1593. It appears to be agreed that, whatever the date or\r\ndesigner of the so-called \"Agas\" may be, it is \"the earliest reliable\r\nsurvey of London.\" Virtue's reprint is dated 1737. Mr. Overall's\r\n\"Facsimile from the original in the possession of the Corporation of the\r\nCity of London\" was published in 1874. It is, however, only by a careful\r\nstudy of the original with a magnifying glass and a good light, that the\r\noutline of the Bethlem buildings can be made out.\r\n\r\nSmith, in his \"Topography of London\" (1816), p. 36, says that the only\r\nplan of London showing the first Bethlem which he had been able to meet\r\nwith is that by Hollar. This map showed Moorfields divided into\r\nquarters, with trees surrounding each division, the site of the second\r\nBethlem being then an uninterrupted space, and a cluster of five\r\nwindmills standing on the site of the north side of Finsbury, a part of\r\nwhich in Mr. Smith's memory was called Mill Hill. Hollar's rare map\r\n(1666 or 1667) is so much later than Agas, that we have not followed its\r\ndistribution of the buildings. In Faithorne's map, published a few years\r\nearlier (1658), from a survey in 1640, \"Bedlame\" is represented as a\r\nquadrangle, with a gate in the wall on the south side. There is a very\r\nclear outline of the first Bethlem in Lee and Glynne's map of London (in\r\nMr. Gardner's collection), published at the Atlas and Hercules, Fleet\r\nStreet, without date. This map is also in the British Museum. Mr. Coote,\r\nof the Map Department, fixes the date at about 1705. Rocque's map of\r\nLondon (1746) shows Bethlem distinctly. This map, and Ogilby's, formed\r\nthe basis of Mr. Newton's \"London in the Olden Time,\" 1855.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the story of the skeleton in irons and Sir T. Rowe's\r\nburying-ground, mentioned at p. 49, it is not disputed that he was\r\nconcerned in the burying-ground of Bethlem; but the skeleton appears to\r\nhave been found some distance from this spot. What is stated in Strype's\r\n\"Stow\" (Bk. ii. p. 96, edit. 1720), is that in 1569 \"Sir Thomas Rowe\r\ncaused to be enclosed with a wall about one acre, being part of the said\r\nhospital of Bethlem, to wit, on the west, on the bank of Deep Ditch,\r\nparting the hospital from Moorfields. This he did for burial in case of\r\nsuch parishes of London as wanted ground convenient within their\r\nparishes. This was called New Churchyard near Bethlem.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some very fine prints of the _second_ Bethlem Hospital in the\r\nPrint Room of the British Museum. Of these (to which Mr. Crace's\r\ncollection is a recent valuable addition), and the prints in Mr.\r\nGardner's private collection and the Guildhall Library, the following\r\nlist has been prepared. I have again to thank Mr. Gardner and Mr. Coote\r\nfor their assistance. I have also to thank Mr. Crace for allowing me to\r\nsee his prints before they were removed to the British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEWS OF BETHLEM HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n1.

Of asylums he says, \"The conduct of public\r\nhospitals or institutions for the reception of lunatics needs no remark;\r\nthe excellence in the management of them is its own encomium\" (p. 123).\r\nOf private madhouses under the management of regular physicians, he\r\nventured to say that \"people might securely trust that in them the\r\nafflicted would be judiciously and tenderly treated, and also managed by\r\nservants selected and instructed with such judgment as will make them as\r\nzealous of their own character and reputation, as of the honour of their\r\nemployers. In such hands we may place implicit confidence; and a perfect\r\nassurance that in such an abode dwells nothing offensive or obnoxious\r\nto humanity--here no greedy heir, no interested relations will be\r\npermitted to compute a time for the patient's fate to afford them an\r\nopportunity to pillage and to plunder. But such dwellings are the seats\r\nof honour, courtesy, kindness, gentleness, mercy, and whatsoever things\r\nare honest and of good report.\" Such was the comfortable satisfaction\r\nwith which a worthy man in 1792 regarded the condition of the insane in\r\nEnglish asylums in that year. He admits, however, that in private\r\nasylums kept by illiterate persons, compassion as well as integrity is\r\noftentimes to be suspected, and quotes a passage from a paper written in\r\n1791, which asserts that \"if the gaolers of the mind do not find a\r\npatient mad, their oppressive tyranny soon makes him so.\"\r\n\r\nThe work written by Dr. Mason Cox (Fishponds, near Bristol) was the best\r\nmedical treatise of the day on insanity. Unlike Cullen, he objects to\r\n\"stripes\" in the treatment of the insane. On the cold bath he says,\r\n\"Even so late as Boerhaave we have the most vague directions for its\r\nemployment; such as keeping the patient immersed till he is almost\r\ndrowned, or while the attendants could repeat the Miserere.... The mode\r\nrecommended and so successfully practised by Dr. Currie of Liverpool is\r\ncertainly the best, that of suddenly immersing the maniac in the very\r\nacme of his paroxysm; and this may be easily accomplished if the\r\npatient, previously secured by a strait waistcoat, be fixed in a common\r\nWindsor chair by strong broad straps of leather or web girth\" (p. 135,\r\n3rd edit., 1813). The author observes that it is certainly worth trying\r\nwhether keeping a patient for days in succession in a state of\r\nintoxication would be beneficial, where every other means has failed (p.\r\n75).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\n(Page 146.)\r\n\r\n\r\nASYLUMS IN OPERATION IN 1792.\r\n\r\nBethlem Hospital.

III., c. 49), from that year to the projection of\r\nthe York Retreat (1792), was 6405; and from 1792 to the Select Committee\r\nof 1815, 12,938.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 the number registered during the year was 406; and in 1791,\r\nafter various rises and falls, it was also 406.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 the number rose to 491, and in 1815 to 850; the lowest being 414\r\nin 1807, and the highest 700 in 1812.\r\n\r\nThe above list of asylums shows how scanty was the provision made for\r\nthe care of the insane at the time of the foundation of the York\r\nRetreat. I may here add that, in addition to the notice taken of this\r\nexperiment by the writers on the Continent mentioned in the text, the\r\nattention of the Germans was forcibly directed to it by Dr. Max. Jacobi,\r\nof Siegburg. He visited York, and, much struck by what he witnessed\r\nthere, translated into German the greater part of the \"Description of\r\nthe Retreat.\" The late superintendent of the Retreat, Dr. Kitching, who\r\nfilled that office for many years with much efficiency, spent a\r\nconsiderable time at the Siegburg Asylum, comparing notes with Dr.\r\nJacobi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\n(Page 173.)\r\n\r\n\r\n9 GEO. IV., C. 40 (1828).\r\n\r\nThe fifteen persons appointed Commissioners in Lunacy for the\r\nmetropolitan district, five of whom were physicians, were paid L1 an\r\nhour, and were appointed for one year. They were to meet quarterly for\r\nthe purpose of granting licences, those in the provinces being granted\r\nby justices at quarter sessions, where three or more justices were to be\r\nelected to visit the provincial licensed houses, together with at least\r\none medical Visitor.\r\n\r\nThree of the Commissioners were to visit licensed houses in the\r\nmetropolitan district four times a year.\r\n\r\nTwo justices to visit licensed houses in the provinces, accompanied by\r\nthe medical Visitor, four times a year.\r\n\r\nAn annual report was to be prepared and presented to the Secretary of\r\nState for the Home Department.\r\n\r\nPrivate patients were not to be admitted to asylums without the\r\ncertificates of two medical men and an order; the certificates being in\r\nforce fourteen days before admission.\r\n\r\nPauper patients were not to be admitted without one medical certificate\r\nand the order of two justices, or an overseer and clergyman.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of an asylum had to transmit a copy of documents to the\r\nCommissioners or justices, as the case might be.\r\n\r\nSingle patients to be received on like order and certificates. No\r\nregular visitation of this class instituted.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that among the previous Acts, now repealed, there\r\nwas a small Act passed May 2, 1815, notwithstanding the failure of Mr.\r\nRose to induce Parliament to undertake legislation based on the evidence\r\ngiven before the Committee of that year. This was the Act 55 Geo. III.,\r\nc. 46, entitled, \"An Act to amend an Act 48 Geo. III., c. 96 (1808),\r\nbeing an Act for the better Care and Maintenance of Lunatics being\r\nPaupers or Criminals in England.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee of visiting justices of lunatic asylums were to be elected\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nSubscribers to lunatic asylums erected by voluntary contributions, who\r\nshould unite with any county, might elect a committee of governors to\r\nact with committee of visiting justices.\r\n\r\nJustices to fix sums to be expended in purchase of lands, houses, etc.,\r\nor in erecting buildings.\r\n\r\nOverseers of the poor to return lists of all lunatics and idiots within\r\ntheir parishes, verified on oath and accompanied with a medical\r\ncertificate.\r\n\r\nWhen any asylum could accommodate more lunatics, magistrate might order\r\nan addition under certain regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\n(Page 188.)\r\n\r\n\r\n8 AND 9 VICT., C. 100 (1845).\r\n\r\nThe following are the clauses of the Act which provide for the expense\r\nof carrying out its provisions.\r\n\r\nBy this statute it was enacted, after repealing 2 and 3 Will. IV., c.\r\n107; 3 and 4 Will. IV., c. 64; 5 and 6 Will. IV., c. 22; 1 and 2 Vict.,\r\nc. 73; 3 Vict., c. 4; 5 and 6 Vict., c. 87, that the Commissioners in\r\nLunacy under 5 and 6 Vict., c. 84, should be henceforth called \"the\r\nMasters in Lunacy,\" and that new Commissioners in Lunacy should be\r\nappointed. The Commissioners were to grant licences for the reception of\r\nlunatics within a certain jurisdiction of the metropolis; justices of\r\nthe peace in general or quarter sessions licensing houses for the\r\nreception of lunatics and appointing Visitors in all other parts of\r\nEngland and Wales, including a medical man. For every licence granted a\r\nsum to be paid of ten shillings for every private patient and two\r\nshillings and sixpence for every pauper, or so much more as shall make\r\nup the sum of fifteen pounds, these moneys being applied towards the\r\npayment of the expenses of the Commissioners or any charge incurred by\r\ntheir authority. The secretary of the Commissioners to make out an\r\nannual account of moneys received and paid by him in the execution of\r\nthe Act, to be laid before the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, the\r\nbalance (if any) to be paid into the Exchequer to the account of the\r\nConsolidated Fund, such accounts being laid before Parliament every\r\nyear, the Treasury being empowered to pay out of the Consolidated Fund\r\nany balance of payments over receipts which may be necessary. With\r\nregard to the application of moneys received by the clerk of the peace\r\nfor provincial licences, they were to be applied towards the payment of\r\nthe clerk to the Visitors for the county, and the remuneration of the\r\nmedical Visitors, and other expenses incurred in the execution of the\r\nAct, the accounts being laid before the justices at the general or\r\nquarter sessions, who shall direct the balance (if any) to be paid into\r\nthe hands of the treasurer of the county or borough in aid of the rate;\r\nany balance of payment over receipts being paid out of the county or\r\nborough funds.\r\n\r\nThere was paid into the Exchequer in the year ending March 31, 1880,\r\nL1376 for licences in the metropolitan district, besides L18 stamps.\r\nLunacy Board expenses, L15,064.\r\n\r\nI have not any accurate returns of the amounts received from the\r\nprovincial houses, but on a rough estimate these licences produce to the\r\ncounties in the aggregate L1452, and L30 to the Imperial Exchequer, per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, August 26, 1846, an Act was passed \"to amend the\r\nLaw concerning Lunatic Asylums and the Care of Pauper Lunatics in\r\nEngland,\" and was to be construed with 8 and 9 Vict., c. 126. There were\r\nonly twelve sections. It was passed to clear up doubts which had been\r\nentertained as to the meaning of certain clauses in the above Act. It\r\nwas repealed by 16 and 17 Vict., c. 97.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F.\r\n\r\n(Page 190.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the legislation of 1853, the Acts referred to at p. 190 and p. 188\r\nconstituted, with 8 and 9 Vict., c. 100, and 15 and 16 Vict., c. 48, and\r\nthe Acts relative to criminal lunatics, the then code of Lunacy Law.\r\n\r\nLord St. Leonards' first Act, p. 188 (16 and 17 Vict., c. 70), enacts\r\nthat when the Commissioners shall report to the Lord Chancellor that\r\nthey are of opinion that the property of any lunatic, not so found by\r\ninquisition, is not duly protected, or the income thereof not duly\r\napplied for his benefit, such report shall be deemed tantamount to any\r\norder or petition for inquiry supported by evidence, and the case shall\r\nproceed as nearly as may be in all respects as therein directed upon the\r\npresentation of a petition for inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe next Act (16 and 17 Vict., c. 96) prescribes amended forms of orders\r\nand certificates, notices of admission, and of the medical visitation\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nThe requirements on the part of the medical man signing the certificate\r\nare laid down.\r\n\r\nEmpowers proprietors or superintendents of licensed houses (with consent\r\nof Commissioners) to entertain as a boarder any patient desiring to\r\nremain after his discharge, or any relation or friend of a patient.\r\n\r\nAuthorizes amendment of any order or certificate within fourteen days\r\nafter admission of patient.\r\n\r\nPermits the Commissioners to allow medical visitation of single patients\r\nless frequently than once a fortnight.\r\n\r\nEmpowers one or more Visitors to visit single patients at request of\r\nCommissioners, and report to them their condition.\r\n\r\nDirects that the medical man who visits a single patient shall make an\r\nannual report to the Commissioners of the mental and bodily health of\r\nsuch patient.\r\n\r\nEmpowers the Lord Chancellor to discharge single patients.\r\n\r\nDirects that notice of the recovery of every patient shall be sent to\r\nhis friends, or in case of a pauper to his parish officers, and in case\r\nof death of a patient in any hospital or licensed house, a statement of\r\nthe cause, etc., to the coroner.\r\n\r\nAuthorizes transfer of a private patient (with consent of two\r\nCommissioners) from one asylum, hospital, or licensed house to another,\r\nwithout any fresh order or certificate, and similarly as to single\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nEmpowers the Lord Chancellor, on the representation of the\r\nCommissioners, to require a statement of the property and application\r\nof the income of any person detained as a lunatic under an order and\r\ncertificates.\r\n\r\nExtends to the Commissioners the powers vested in the private committee,\r\nas to single patients, by the Act 8 and 9 Vict., c. 100, s. 111.\r\n\r\nRepeals s. 27 of 8 and 9 Vict., c. 100, as to the visitation of\r\nworkhouses; and enacts that one or more Commissioners shall visit such\r\nworkhouses as the Board shall direct.\r\n\r\nAuthorizes the Commissioners in urgent cases to employ any competent\r\nperson to visit any lunatic and to report to them.\r\n\r\nDirects committee of every hospital to submit regulations to the\r\nSecretary of State for approval, and to send a copy to Commissioners.\r\n\r\nEmpowers Commissioners, with sanction of the Secretary of State, to make\r\nregulations for the government of licensed houses.\r\n\r\nEnacts that Bethlem Hospital shall be subject to the provisions of Act 8\r\nand 9 Vict., c. 100.\r\n\r\nThe third Act (16 and 17 Vict., c. 97) repeals the several Acts then in\r\nforce respecting county and borough lunatic asylums, and re-enacts most\r\nof the provisions therein contained, with certain additions and\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nIt authorizes justices of boroughs, instead of providing asylums for\r\ntheir own use, or in arranging with counties, etc., to contract with the\r\nVisitors of any asylum for the reception of their pauper lunatics, in\r\nconsideration of certain payments.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the Visitors were enlarged in many ways.\r\n\r\nWhen a county or borough asylum can accommodate more than its own pauper\r\nlunatics, the Visitors are empowered to permit the admission of the\r\npauper lunatics of any other county or borough, or lunatics who are not\r\npaupers, but proper objects to be admitted into a public asylum, such\r\nnon-pauper patients to have the same accommodation, in all respects, as\r\nthe pauper lunatics.\r\n\r\nThe Visitors are directed to appoint a medical officer to be\r\nsuperintendent of the asylum.\r\n\r\nThey are empowered to grant superannuation annuities to the officers\r\nand servants.\r\n\r\nThey are directed to make an annual report to the general or quarter\r\nsessions of the state of the asylum.\r\n\r\nEvery pauper lunatic, not in an asylum, hospital, or licensed house, is\r\nto be visited every quarter by the medical officer of the parish or\r\nunion, who is to make return thereof; and the medical officer is to be\r\npaid two shillings and sixpence for every visit.\r\n\r\nThe forms of orders, statements, and medical certificates are amended,\r\nand the medical officers of unions are permitted to sign certificates.\r\n\r\nThe medical man certifying is required to state his qualification, when\r\nand where the patient was examined, and to specify facts indicating\r\ninsanity; distinguishing facts observed by himself from those\r\ncommunicated to him by others.\r\n\r\nVisitors are empowered to order the removal of pauper patients to and\r\nfrom asylums, and also to discharge or permit the absence on trial of\r\nany patient. The Commissioners are empowered to direct the removal of\r\nany lunatic from any asylum, hospital, or licensed house to any other.\r\n\r\nThe person signing the order for admission of a private patient into an\r\nasylum may discharge such patient, subject, in the case of dangerous\r\nlunatics, to the consent of the visiting justices. Any person having\r\nauthority to discharge a private patient is empowered (with consent of\r\ntwo Commissioners) to transfer him to another asylum or to the care of\r\nany person.\r\n\r\nOrders and certificates, if defective, may be amended within fourteen\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nPatients escaping may be retaken within fourteen days.\r\n\r\nThis statute did not re-enact the clause contained in the Act it\r\nrepealed respecting workhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n18 AND 19 VICT., C. 105 (1855).\r\n\r\nIn 1855 was passed the Act 18 and 19 Vict., c. 105, \"to amend the\r\nLunatic Asylum Acts and the Acts passed in the Ninth and Seventeenth\r\nYears of Her Majesty, for the Regulation of the Care and Treatment of\r\nLunatics.\"\r\n\r\nBy this statute it was enacted that any single county or borough might\r\nunite with the subscribers to a registered hospital, and that the\r\nproportion of expenses between any county and borough might be fixed\r\nwith reference to accommodation likely to be required.\r\n\r\nOther sections provide in detail for the maintenance of county and\r\nborough asylums, and other matters which it is unnecessary to enumerate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX G.\r\n\r\n(Page 195.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA short summary is added of the provisions in force at the time of the\r\nSelect Committee of 1859-60, for the protection of private patients.\r\nThey remain essentially the same.\r\n\r\nIn the metropolis, the power of licensing is exclusively in the hands of\r\nthe Metropolitan Commissioners. In the provincial districts it rests\r\nwith the justices at quarter sessions. These licenses are annually\r\nrenewed, and they may be revoked by the Lord Chancellor. The patients\r\nare admitted upon an order signed by some relative or friend, with a\r\nstatement of all the particulars of the case. This statement must be\r\nsupported by the certificates of two medical practitioners, who, having\r\nexamined the patient separately within seven days previous to the\r\nreception, state that he is a person of unsound mind, and a proper\r\nperson to be detained under care and treatment. It must also specify the\r\ngrounds upon which their opinion has been formed, viz. the facts\r\nobserved by themselves or communicated by others. After two and before\r\nthe expiration of seven clear days, the proprietor or superintendent of\r\nthe licensed house must transmit to the Commissioners, and also to the\r\nvisiting justices, if the licensed house is within their jurisdiction, a\r\ncopy of the order and certificates. The licensed house must be visited\r\nby two of the Commissioners, four times at least every year, if it lies\r\nwithin their immediate jurisdiction; and if beyond, it must be visited\r\nfour times at least by Visitors appointed by the justices, one of whom\r\nshall be a medical man, and twice at least by two of the Commissioners.\r\nIn the course of such visits, inquiries are directed to be made as to\r\nthe occupation, amusement, classification, condition, and dietary of the\r\ndifferent patients, and also whether a system of non-coercion has been\r\nadopted or not; and where it shall appear, either to the Commissioners\r\nor to the visiting justices, that a patient is detained without\r\nsufficient cause, they have the power, under certain conditions, of\r\nordering his discharge. When a patient recovers, the proprietor or\r\nsuperintendent is required to send notice of such recovery to the person\r\nwho signed the order for his reception; and if such patient is not\r\ndischarged or removed within fourteen days, the proprietor is required\r\nimmediately to transmit a similar notice to the Commissioners or\r\nvisiting justices, as the case may be. When a patient dies, the medical\r\npractitioner who attended such patient during his illness is to cause a\r\nstatement to be entered in the case-book, setting forth the time and\r\ncause of death, and the duration of the disease of which the patient\r\ndied, and a copy of such statement, within two days, must be transmitted\r\nto the coroner. In addition to these specific provisions, the\r\nCommissioners have power from time to time to make regulations for the\r\ngovernment of any of these licensed houses, and they must report\r\nannually to the Lord Chancellor the number of visits they have made, the\r\nnumber of patients they have seen, the state and condition of the house,\r\nthe care of the patients therein, and such other particulars as they may\r\nthink deserving of notice (p. vi.).\r\n\r\n\r\n25 AND 26 VICT., C. 111, \"THE LUNACY ACTS AMENDMENT ACT, 1862.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the importance of the Act of 1862, the Commissioners\r\nissued the following circular noting its chief provisions:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Private Patients._\r\n\r\nSec. 23.--The order must be dated within one month prior to reception;\r\nthe person signing the order must himself have seen the patient within\r\none month prior to its date; and a statement of the time and place when\r\nthe patient was so seen must be appended to the order.\r\n\r\nSec. 25.--When possible, every order must contain the name and address\r\nof one or more relations of the lunatic, to whom notice of the death of\r\na lunatic must be sent.\r\n\r\nSec. 24.--Besides the persons hitherto prohibited from signing\r\ncertificates and orders, the following also are now disqualified:--Any\r\nperson receiving any percentage on or otherwise interested in the\r\npayments for patients, and the medical attendant as defined in the\r\nLunacy Act, c. 100. Also 15 and 16 Vict., c. 96, s. 12; c. 97, s. 76.\r\n\r\nSec. 26.--Where a patient received as a pauper is made a private\r\npatient, no fresh order or certificate is required, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nSec 28.--With the exception of the statement by the medical officer as\r\nto a patient's mental and bodily condition, all the documents heretofore\r\nrequired to be sent to the Commissioners after two or before seven clear\r\ndays from the reception of the patient, must in future be sent within\r\none clear day from such reception. The medical officer's statement is,\r\nas heretofore, not to be sent until after two and before seven clear\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Letters of Patients._\r\n\r\nSec 40.--Without special directions to the contrary, letters addressed\r\nto the Commissioners, committees of Visitors, committees of a hospital,\r\nand the Visitors of licensed houses, must be forwarded unopened. Other\r\nletters must also be forwarded, unless, by an endorsement thereon, the\r\nsuperintendent or other person having charge of patients should prohibit\r\ntheir transmission. Letters so endorsed to be laid before Commissioners,\r\ncommittees, or Visitors at next visit.\r\n\r\nSec. 38.--Absence on trial may be permitted to patients, in the same way\r\nas leave of absence for the benefit of health is permitted under s. 86,\r\nc. 100.\r\n\r\nSec. 43.--In the absence of any person qualified to discharge, a\r\ndischarge or removal may be ordered by the Commissioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pauper Patients._\r\n\r\nSec. 25.--The order must contain the name and address of one or more\r\nrelations of the lunatic, and notice of the death of the lunatic must be\r\nsent to such relation.\r\n\r\nSec. 38.--A pauper permitted to be absent on trial from a licensed house\r\nor hospital may have such an allowance made to him by order of the\r\nCommissioners, Visitors, or committees as would be charged for him were\r\nhe in the house or hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Licensed Houses and Hospitals._\r\n\r\nSecs. 14 and 15.--No fresh licence can be granted by justices without\r\ninspection and report by the Commissioners. Notices of alterations in\r\nhouses licensed by justices must be given to Commissioners. Their report\r\nmust be considered by the justices before licence is granted or\r\nalterations are consented to.\r\n\r\nSec. 16.--The physician, surgeon, or apothecary not being a licensee,\r\nwhere any such is by law required to reside in or visit a licensed\r\nhouse, must in the metropolitan district be approved of by the\r\nCommissioners, and in the provincial district by the visiting justices.\r\n\r\nA penalty is imposed on any person infringing the terms of his licence\r\nas to numbers, sex, or class.\r\n\r\nSec. 18.--With consent of two of the Commissioners, or, in the case of\r\nthe provincial licensed houses, of two of the Visitors, a person who\r\nmay have been a patient within five years immediately preceding, may be\r\nreceived as a boarder into a licensed house (extension of c. 96, s. 6).\r\n\r\nSec. 29.--Licensed houses may be visited at any time by one or more of\r\nthe Commissioners or Visitors, but in the metropolitan district they\r\nmust be so visited twice in the year, in addition to the present visits\r\nby two Commissioners, and in the provincial districts similarly by\r\nVisitors. Commissioners and Visitors visiting singly have substantially\r\nthe same powers of inspection and inquiry as when visiting together. To\r\nthese the sixty-second section of the Act does not apply.\r\n\r\nSec. 39.--A penalty is now imposed on any officer or servant conniving\r\nat an escape.\r\n\r\nSec. 43.--In the absence of any person qualified under ss. 72, 73, c.\r\n100, the Commissioners may order discharge or removal of a patient.\r\n\r\nSec. 38.--Absence on trial may be permitted to patients, in the same way\r\nas leave of absence for the benefit of health is permitted under s. 86,\r\nc. 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Medical Certificates._\r\n\r\nSec 27.--Where medical certificates have been returned with a written\r\ndirection of the Commissioners for amendment, and such amendment shall\r\nnot have been made within fourteen days, the Commissioners may order the\r\npatient's discharge.\r\n\r\nSec. 22.--Lunatics so found by inquisition may be received without\r\ncertificate on an order of the committee, accompanied by an official\r\ncopy of the order appointing such Committee.[316]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Workhouses._\r\n\r\nThe Poor Law Board issued a circular at the same time. The only\r\nparagraph which it is of interest to cite here is the following:--\"The\r\neighth section empowers the Visitors of any asylum and the guardians of\r\nany parish or union within the district for which the asylum has been\r\nprovided, if they shall see fit, to make arrangements, subject to the\r\napproval of the Commissioners in Lunacy and the President of the Poor\r\nLaw Board, for the reception and care of a limited number of _chronic\r\nlunatics_ in the workhouse of such parish or union, to be selected by\r\nthe superintendent of the asylum and certified by him to be fit and\r\nproper so to be removed. The Board are at present not aware of any\r\nworkhouse in which any such arrangement could conveniently be made; but\r\nthey will be ready to consider any such proposals on the subject when\r\nthe Visitors of the Board of Guardians of any union shall find it\r\nconvenient or practicable to act upon this clause.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[316] Seventeenth Report of Commissioners in Lunacy, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX H.\r\n\r\n(Page 205.)\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract from the _British and Foreign Medical Review_, January, 1840:--\r\n\r\n\"In this particular there is apparently no asylum in England which\r\npresents so remarkable a model as that of Lincoln. Of all the works that\r\nhave appeared on the subject of lunatic houses since the publication of\r\nMr. Tuke's account of the Retreat, there is none which contains matter\r\nmore deserving of attention than that recently published by Mr. Hill.\r\nHis lecture is little more than a simple commentary on the resolutions\r\nof the board of management of the Lincoln Asylum for twenty years past;\r\nduring which period, under the superintendence of Dr. Charlesworth, and\r\nlatterly with the vigilant co-operation of Mr. Hill himself, as house\r\nsurgeon, almost every kind of bodily restraint is stated to have\r\ngradually fallen into disuse as superfluous, a mere substitute for want\r\nof watchful care.... If the Lincoln Asylum can present a model of this\r\nkind, which all may visit and examine, the services of Dr. Charlesworth\r\nto the cause of humanity and in behalf of the insane, already\r\nconsiderable, will only be second to that of him who first released them\r\nfrom their chains.\"\r\n\r\nOn this Mr. Hill observes, July 8, 1840:--\r\n\r\n\"At last the first Medical Review in Europe took up the subject, and\r\nplaced most deservingly Dr. Charlesworth in a striking position as to\r\nthe non-restraint system, and also honoured myself with approbation.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the Orders in the Lincoln Asylum books[317]\r\nare essential to the right understanding of the introduction of\r\nnon-restraint there. Dr. Charlesworth was visiting physician from its\r\nopening in 1821; Mr. Hill was appointed house surgeon in 1835.\r\n\r\n\"1828. _Ordered_--That the use of the strait waistcoat be discontinued\r\nin this institution except under the special written order of the\r\nphysician of the month.\r\n\r\n\"1828, October 13. Ordered and resolved--That the physicians be\r\nrequested to consider whether it be possible to make any improvement in\r\nthe means of restraint now in use, and especially for obviating the use\r\nof the strait waistcoat.\"\r\n\r\nExtract from the Fifth Report of the Lincoln Lunatic Asylum, 1829,\r\nApril:--\r\n\r\n\"The governors have particularly directed their views to the subject of\r\ncoercion and restraint, well aware of their injurious consequences to\r\nthe patients.... The construction of the instruments in use having also\r\nbeen carefully examined, they have destroyed a considerable proportion\r\nof those that were not of the most improved and least irritating\r\ndescription, and hope hereafter to introduce still further amelioration\r\ninto this department.\"\r\n\r\nExtract from the House Visitor's Report, 1829, August 17:--\r\n\r\n\"Every attention seems to be paid to the patients, whose general state\r\nhas, I understand, for some time past, been so generally good that it\r\nis gratifying to say that the strait waistcoat has almost become\r\nuseless.\"\r\n\r\nExtract from the Seventh Annual Report, 1831, March 28:--\r\n\r\n\"Heretofore it was conceived that the only intention of a receptacle for\r\nthe insane was the safe custody of the unhappy objects, by any means,\r\nhowever harsh and severe. These views are now passing away, and the fair\r\nmeasure of a superintendent's ability, in the treatment of such\r\npatients, will be found in the small number of restraints which are\r\nimposed. The new director has answered this test in a very satisfactory\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\nThe new director here referred to was Mr. Henry Marston. The following\r\nnote is appended to this report:--\r\n\r\n\"As early as the 24th day of November last (viz. Nov., 1830, five years\r\nbefore Mr. Hill's appointment), there was not any patient in the house\r\nunder restraint, unless one wearing a collar, which leaves all the limbs\r\nquite at liberty, can be so considered.

To him, hobbles\r\nand chains, handcuffs and muffs, were but material impediments that\r\nmerely confined the limbs; to get rid of these he spent the best years\r\nof his life; but beyond these mechanical fetters he saw there were a\r\nhundred fetters to the spirit, which human sympathy, courage, and time\r\nonly could remove.\r\n\r\n\"Perfect as was the experiment carried out at Lincoln Asylum, the\r\nremoteness of that institution from the great centre of life, and the\r\nwant of authority in its author, would no doubt have prevented its\r\nacceptance for years by the physicians of the great county asylums so\r\nlong wedded to old habits. It was for some time treated as the freak of\r\nan enthusiastic mind, that would speedily go the way of all such\r\nnew-fangled notions; and no doubt it would, had not an irresistible\r\nimpulse been given to it by the installation of Dr. Conolly at Hanwell,\r\nwhere, with a noble ardour, he at once set to work to carry out in the\r\nthen largest asylum in the kingdom the lesson he had learned at\r\nLincoln.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Conolly's works bearing on mental disorders, in addition to his\r\n\"Lectures on Insanity,\" were as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. \"An Inquiry concerning the Indications of Insanity, with Suggestions\r\nfor the better Protection and Care of the Insane.\" 1830.\r\n\r\n2. \"The Construction and Government of Lunatic Asylums and Hospitals for\r\nthe Insane.\" 1847.\r\n\r\n3. \"The Treatment of the Insane without Mechanical Restraints.\" 1856.\r\n\r\nSee \"Memoir of Dr. Conolly.\" By Sir James Clark. 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[317] As given in the _Journal of Mental Science_, July, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n(Page 236.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners give, in their Report for 1857, a table in support of\r\nthe statement at p. 236, but it is not borne out by the _average_ of the\r\nsix largest and six smallest county asylums.\r\n\r\n  --------------+---------------------+---------------------\r\n                |    Daily average    | Average weekly cost\r\n      Asylum.   | number of patients. |     per head.\r\n  --------------+---------------------+---------------------\r\n                |                     |          s.   d.\r\n  Colney Hatch  |         1257        |          9    10\r\n  Hanwell       |         1020        |         10     5-3/4\r\n  Surrey        |          934        |          8     8-3/4\r\n  Wakefield     |          803        |          7     4\r\n  Lancaster     |          710        |          8     1-1/2\r\n  Prestwich     |          509        |          7    10\r\n                +---------------------+---------------------\r\n                | Average} 872        | Average} 8     8-1/2\r\n                |  number}            | cost   }\r\n                |                     |\r\n  Dorset        |          155        |          8     1\r\n  Denbigh       |          189        |          9     8-3/4\r\n  Bucks         |          192        |         10     8\r\n  Notts         |          216        |         10     5\r\n  Cornwall      |          238        |          8     3-3/4\r\n  Chester       |          278        |          8     6\r\n                +---------------------+---------------------\r\n                | Average} 211        | Average} 9     3\r\n                |  number}            |    cost}\r\n  --------------+---------------------+---------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX K I.\r\n\r\n(Page 258.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sketch of the rise and growth of county asylums and registered\r\nhospitals would not be complete without giving the provision obtained,\r\nup to the present time, by means of rates on the one hand and private\r\ncharity on the other.
