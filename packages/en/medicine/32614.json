It is, however, unique in being an actual record of the doings\r\nof one gang of the resurrection-men in London. Many persons have expressed\r\na wish that so interesting a document should be published; permission\r\nhaving been obtained to print the Diary, an endeavour has been made to\r\ngratify this wish. To make the reprint more interesting, and to explain\r\nsome of the allusions in the Diary, an account of the resurrection-men in\r\nLondon, and a short history of the events which preceded the passing of\r\nthe Anatomy Act, have been prepared.\r\n\r\nThe great crimes of Burke and Hare drew especial attention to\r\nbody-snatching in Edinburgh, and consequently there have been published\r\nample accounts of the resurrection-men in Scotland.[1] For this reason,\r\nEdinburgh has been omitted from the present work.\r\n\r\nAs to the genuineness of the Diary there can be no doubt. It was presented\r\nto the Royal College of Surgeons of England by the late Sir Thomas\r\nLongmore. In his early days, Sir Thomas was dresser to Bransby Cooper, and\r\nassisted him in writing the _Life of Sir Astley Cooper_.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of Lord Abinger, it was decided to introduce an account\r\nof the resurrection-men into the book. The information for this was partly\r\nobtained by Mr. Longmore from personal communication with some of the\r\nresurrection-men, who were then living in London. One of these handed over\r\nportions of a Diary he had kept during his resurrectionist days. This was\r\npreserved for some years at Netley, and was afterwards presented to the\r\nCollege, as stated above. A few extracts from the Diary were printed in\r\nthe _Life of Sir Astley Cooper_.\r\n\r\nThe information respecting the resurrection-men is very scattered; the two\r\nmost useful works for getting up this subject are the _Life of Astley\r\nCooper_ before mentioned, and the _Report of the Committee on Anatomy_\r\npublished in 1828. Most of the detailed information has to be sought for\r\nin the newspapers of the period. The accounts there given are, however,\r\ngenerally of such an exaggerated character that it is often very difficult\r\nto arrive at the truth. When any fresh scandal had given prominence to the\r\ndoings of the resurrection-men, the newspapers saw \"Burking\" in every\r\ntrivial case of assault. If a child were lost, the paragraph announcing\r\nthe fact was headed, \"Another supposed case of Burking.\" Reports of the\r\nmost ridiculous character were duly chronicled as facts by the newspapers\r\nof the day. Sometimes over a hundred bodies were supposed to have been\r\nfound in some building, and it was expected that several persons of\r\neminence would be named in the subsequent proceedings. Search in the\r\npapers nearly always fails to find any further mention of the case.\r\n\r\nIn reading these accounts it must be remembered that \"Burking\" did not\r\nalways mean killing a person for the purpose of selling the body, but it\r\nreferred to the mode adopted by Burke and Hare in killing their victims,\r\nviz., suffocation. Elizabeth Ross is called a \"Burker,\" and may be found\r\nso described in Haydn's _Dictionary of Dates_. She murdered an old woman\r\nnamed Catherine Walsh, but in the report of her trial there is no evidence\r\nof her having attempted to sell the body.\r\n\r\nThe broadside here printed is an excellent example of this exaggeration.\r\nThe facts are so circumstantial, that it appears as though there could be\r\nno mistake. Enquiry at Edinburgh, however, shows that no such case\r\noccurred. Mr. A. D. Veitch, of the Justiciary Office, has very kindly made\r\nsearch, and can find no record of Wilson's supposed crimes. Had the\r\nstatements in the broadside been true, there is no doubt that this case\r\nwould have been referred to in books on Medical Jurisprudence. Poisoning\r\nby inhalation of arsenic is rare, and Wilson's would have been a leading\r\ncase. There would also have been great opportunities for studying _post\r\nmortem_ appearances, as it is stated that three bodies were found in\r\nWilson's possession. Search through the chief books on the subject has\r\nfailed in finding any reference whatever to this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"BURKING BY MEANS OF SNUFF.\r\n\r\n\"_The following Account is of so serious a Nature that no one can be too\r\ncautious how they receive Snuff from Strangers._\r\n\r\n\"It appears that, on Monday se'nnight, a man, named John Wilson, was\r\napprehended at Edinburgh on a charge of Burking a number of persons by\r\nintroducing arsenic into snuff kept by him. He had long excited the\r\nsuspicion of the police of that place, but so deep-laid were his\r\ndiabolical schemes that he eluded their vigilance for a considerable time,\r\nuntil Monday last. When, on the moors, on that day, between Lauder and\r\nDalkeith, practising his dreadful trade, it appears that the victim of\r\nWilson's villainy was a poor man travelling over the moor, whom he\r\naccosted, and offered a pinch of snuff. He took it, and it had the desired\r\neffect. The next individual whom he accosted was a labouring-man breaking\r\nstones, who was asked the number of miles to Edinburgh; when answered, he\r\nthen offered his snuff-box to the labourer, which was refused, alleging\r\nthat he never used any. Wilson urged him again, which excited the man's\r\nsuspicions, but he took the snuff, and wrapped it up in paper, and carried\r\nit to a chemist at Dalkeith, who analysed it, when it proved to be mixed\r\nwith arsenic. The police were then informed of Wilson's villainies, who\r\nwent in pursuit of him, and after a search of him for several days was at\r\nlength apprehended at a place three miles from Edinburgh, driving rapidly\r\nin a vehicle like a hearse, which, on examination, contained three dead\r\nbodies. They were recognised from their dresses to be an elderly man, and\r\nhis wife and son, who were seen travelling towards Lauder the day before.\r\n\r\n\"Wilson was immediately ironed and conveyed to Edinburgh, and a sheriff's\r\ninquest was held on the bodies. After an investigation of nearly two hours\r\na verdict of Wilful Murder was returned against John Wilson, who was fully\r\ncommitted to the Calton gaol to take his trial at the ensuing sessions.\r\n\r\n\"Wilson is described as a desperate character, and of ferocious\r\ncountenance. He is supposed to have been two or three years in this\r\nabominable practice, and to have realised a considerable sum in the course\r\nof that time. His career is now stopped, and that justice and doom which\r\novertook a Burke and a Hare are his last and only portion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"LINES ON THE OCCASION.\r\n\r\n  Of Burke and of Hare we have heard much about,\r\n  Yet Burking's a trade that was lately found out--\r\n  Their plans of despatching were wicked indeed,\r\n  'T was thought of all others that theirs did exceed;\r\n  But the scheme first invented of Burking by snuff,\r\n  May yet be prevented by taking the huff,\r\n  For if strangers invite you to take of their dust,\r\n  Decline their kind offers--refuse them you must;\r\n  And would you be safe, and keep from all evil,\r\n  Shun them as pests as you'd shun the d----l;\r\n  By these means you'll live, avoiding all strife,\r\n  Shunning snuff takers all the days of your life.\r\n\r\n  \"_Printed for the Publishers by T. KAY._\"\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of getting reliable information is increased by the\r\nincomplete nature of most of the newspaper records. In many cases there is\r\nan account of a preliminary examination of some of the men who were\r\narrested for body-stealing. The report states that they were remanded, but\r\nfurther search fails to find any subsequent notice of the case. It is\r\noften impossible to fix who the men were who thus got into trouble, as\r\nthey nearly always gave false names: unless they were too well-known to\r\nthe police who arrested them, they invariably did this.\r\n\r\nFor the photographs, from which the illustrations of the house at Crail\r\nare taken, the writer is indebted to the kindness of Prof. Chiene, of\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIARY OF A RESURRECTIONIST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complaint as to the scarcity of bodies for dissection is as old as the\r\nhistory of anatomy itself. Great respect for the body of the dead has\r\ncharacterised mankind in nearly all ages; _post mortem_ dissection was\r\nlooked upon as a great indignity by the relatives of the deceased, and\r\nevery precaution was taken to prevent its occurrence.\r\n\r\nIt would be beyond the scope of the present work to attempt a history of\r\nanatomical teaching; as will be pointed out later on, the resurrection-men\r\ndid not come into existence until the early part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain the study of medicine and surgery was much hampered at\r\nthis date by the scarcity of opportunities by which the student might get\r\na practical acquaintance with the anatomy of the human body. A knowledge\r\nof anatomy was insisted upon by the Corporation of Surgeons, as each\r\nstudent had to produce a certificate of having attended at least two\r\ncourses of dissection. It is unnecessary to point out the wisdom of this\r\ncondition in the case of men who were to go out into the world as\r\nsurgeons, and, consequently, to have the lives of their fellow-men in\r\ntheir hands. The attendance on the two courses of dissection could be\r\nevaded, and this was frequently done. The Apothecaries' Hall had no such\r\nrestriction, and, consequently, many men went thither and received a\r\nqualification to practise, although they were quite unacquainted with\r\nhuman anatomy. The work of such 'prentice hands one trembles to think of;\r\nwhatever experience these men did gain was obtained after they began to\r\npractise, and so must have been at the expense of their patients, who were\r\ngenerally those of the poorer class in life.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out by Mr. Guthrie, that in the then state of the law a\r\nsurgeon might be punished in one Court for want of skill, and in another\r\nCourt the same individual might also be punished for trying to obtain that\r\nskill. Before the Anatomy Committee, in 1828, Sir Astley Cooper narrated\r\nthe case of a young man who was rejected at the College of Surgeons on\r\naccount of his ignorance of the parts of the body; it was found, on\r\nenquiry, that he was a most diligent student, and that his ignorance arose\r\nentirely from his being unable to procure that which was necessary for\r\ncarrying on this part of his education.\r\n\r\nWhen bodies were obtained for dissection it was generally by surreptitious\r\nmeans; the newly-made grave was too often the source from whence the\r\nsupply was obtained. At first there was no direct trade or traffic in\r\nsubjects by men who devoted all their efforts to this mode of obtaining a\r\nlivelihood. The students supplied their own wants as they arose. Mr. G. S.\r\nPatterson told the Committee that at St. George's Hospital the students\r\nhad to exhume bodies for their own use.\r\n\r\nIn the _Diary of a Late Physician_ Samuel Warren has given us a chapter on\r\nthis subject, which he calls \"Grave Doings,\" and which is probably\r\nfounded on fact. The object in the expedition here recorded was, however,\r\nrather to obtain a valuable pathological specimen, than to get a body for\r\ndissection. Writers of fiction have made use of body-snatching, and have\r\ngiven a gruesome turn to their stories by making the body, when uncovered,\r\nturn out to be that of a relation or friend of some one of the party\r\nengaged in the exhumation. Such a tale is recorded in the _Monthly\r\nMagazine_ for April, 1827; there a sailor is pressed into the service of\r\nsome students who were anxious to obtain a body. The subject was safely\r\nbrought home, and, on being taken from the sack, turned out to be the\r\nsweetheart of the sailor, who had just returned from sea, and, not having\r\nheard of his girl's decease, was on his way to greet her after a long\r\nabsence from home. Truth and fiction often agree. There is a case on\r\nrecord of a child who had died of scrofula, and whose body was brought to\r\nSt. Thomas' Hospital by Holliss, a well-known resurrectionist. The body\r\nwas at once recognised by one of the students as that of his sister's\r\nchild; on this being made known to the authorities at the hospital, the\r\ncorpse was immediately buried before any dissection had taken place.\r\n\r\nIn vols. 1 and 2 of the _Medical Times_ there is a series of articles,\r\nentitled \"The Confessions of Jasper Muddle, Dissecting-room Porter.\" These\r\npapers are signed \"Rocket,\" but were written by Albert Smith.[2] One of\r\nthe articles contains an account of a handsome young lady who came to the\r\ndissecting-room late at night, and begged for the body of a murderer\r\nexecuted the previous day, which was then being injected, ready for\r\nlecture purposes. In the _Tale of Two Cities_, Dickens has given us a good\r\nstudy of a resurrection-man in the person of Mr. Cruncher. Moir in _Mansie\r\nWauch_, Lytton in _Lucretia_, Mrs. Crowe in _Light and Darkness_, and Miss\r\nSergeant in _Dr. Endicott's Experiment_, have also used the body-snatcher\r\nin fiction.\r\n\r\nAs long as the Barber Surgeons kept to their right of the exclusive\r\nteaching of anatomy, there was small need of bodies for dissection. This\r\nright the Company jealously guarded. On 21st May, 1573, the following\r\nentry occurs in the records, \"Here was John Deane and appoynted to brynge\r\nin his fyne x{li} for havinge an Anathomye in his howse contrary to an\r\norder in that behalf between this and mydsomer next.\"[3] As late as 1714\r\nthis rule was put in force against no less a man than William Cheselden.\r\nThe entry in the books of the Company runs as follows, \"At a Court of\r\nAssistants of the Company of Barbers and Surgeons, held on the 25th March,\r\n1714. Our Master acquainting the Court that Mr. William Cheselden, a\r\nmember of this Company, did frequently procure the Dead bodies of\r\nMalefactors from the place of execution and dissect the same at his own\r\nhouse, as well during the Company's Publick Lectures as at other times\r\nwithout the leave of the Governors and contrary to the Company's By law in\r\nthat behalf. By which means it became more difficult for the Beadles to\r\nbring away the Companies Bodies and likewise drew away the members of this\r\nCompany and others from the Public Dissections and Lectures at the Hall.\r\nThe said Mr. Cheselden was, therefore, called in. But having submitted\r\nhimself to the pleasure of the Court with a promise never to dissect at\r\nthe same as the Company had their Lecture at the Hall, nor without leave\r\nof the Governors for the time being, the said Mr. Cheselden was excused\r\nfor what had passed with a reproof for the same pronounced by the Master\r\nat the desire of the Court.\"[4]\r\n\r\nBy the Act Henry VIII., xxii., cap. 12, provision was made for the Company\r\nof Barbers and Surgeons to have the bodies of malefactors for the purpose\r\nof dissection. This part of the Act was as follows: \"And further be it\r\nenacted by thauctoritie aforesayd, that the sayd maysters or governours of\r\nthe mistery and comminaltie of barbours and surgeons of Londo & their\r\nsuccessours yerely for ever after their sad discrecions at their free\r\nliberte and pleasure shal and maie have and take without cõtradiction\r\nfoure persons condempned adjudged and put to deathe for feloni by the due\r\norder of the Kynges lawe of thys realme for anatomies with out any further\r\nsute or labour to be made to the kynges highnes his heyres or successors\r\nfor the same. And to make incision of the same deade bodies or otherwyse\r\nto order the same after their said discrecions at their pleasure for their\r\nfurther and better knowlage instruction in sight learnyng & experience in\r\nthe sayd scyence or facultie of Surgery.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"foure bodies\" could not always be obtained without difficulty;\r\ndespite the precautions of the Company private anatomy was, to a certain\r\nextent, carried on, and the bodies of malefactors had a market value. The\r\nfollowing entries from the _Annals of the Barber Surgeons_ are\r\nillustrative of this:\r\n\r\n\"6th March, 1711.[5] It is ordered that William Cave, one of the Beadles\r\nof this Company, do make Inquiry who the persons were that carryed away\r\nthe last body from Tyburne, and that such persons be Indicted for the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\"9th October, 1711. Richard Russell, one of the persons who stands\r\nIndicted for carrying away the last publick body applying himself to this\r\nCourt and offering to be evidence against the rest of the persons\r\nconcerned It is ordered that the Clerk do apply himself to Her Majesty's\r\nAttorney Generall for a Noli p'sequi as to the said Russell in order to\r\nmake him an evidence upon the s{d} Indictment and particularly ag{st} one\r\nSamuell Waters whom the Court did likewise order to be indicted for the\r\nsaid fact.\"\r\n\r\nOften there were riots caused by the Beadles of the Company going to\r\nTyburn for the bodies of murderers. This rioting was carried to such an\r\nextent that it was found necessary to apply for soldiers to protect the\r\nBeadles.\r\n\r\n\"28th May, 1713. Ordered that the Clerk go to the Secretary at War for a\r\nguard in order to gett the next Body [from Tyburn.]\"\r\n\r\nThe dissection of these bodies was made known by public advertisement. The\r\nfollowing is from the _Daily Advertiser_ of January 15th, 1742: \"Notice is\r\nhereby given that there being a publick Body at Barbers and Surgeons Hall,\r\nthe Demonstrations of Anatomy and the Operations of Surgery will be at the\r\nHall this evening and to-morrow at six o'clock precisely in the\r\nAmphitheatre.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1752 it was ordered that bodies of murderers executed in London and\r\nMiddlesex should be conveyed to the Hall of the Surgeons Company to be\r\ndissected and anatomized, and any attempt to rescue such bodies was made\r\nfelony.\r\n\r\nIn 1745 the Barbers and Surgeons, who from 1540, until that date, had\r\nformed one Company, separated, and the latter were incorporated under the\r\ntitle of \"The Masters, Governors, and Commonalty of the Art and Science of\r\nSurgery.\" To the Surgeons naturally fell the duty of dissecting the bodies\r\nof the malefactors handed over for that purpose. The building of the\r\nSurgeons' Company was in the Old Bailey; there was, therefore, no\r\ndifficulty in removing the bodies from Newgate. In 1796 the Company came\r\nto a premature end through an improperly constituted Court having been\r\nheld. It was attempted to put matters right by a Bill in Parliament, but\r\nthere was so much opposition from those persons who were practising\r\nwithout the diploma of the Corporation, that the Bill, after passing\r\nsafely through the Commons, was thrown out by the Lords. In the following\r\nyear attempts were made to come to terms with the opponents of the Bill,\r\nand finally it was agreed to petition for a Charter from the Crown to\r\nestablish a Royal College of Surgeons in London. These negotiations were\r\nsuccessfully carried out in 1800, and the old Corporation having disposed\r\nof their Old Bailey property to the City Authorities, the College took\r\npossession of a house in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the site of part of the\r\npresent building.\r\n\r\nDuring the debate in the House of Lords on the Bill just mentioned, the\r\nBishop of Bangor, who had charge of the measure, sent for the Clerk of the\r\nCompany, and informed him that a strong opposition was expected to the\r\nBill, on account of the inconvenience that would arise from the bodies of\r\nmurderers being conveyed through the streets from Newgate to Lincoln's Inn\r\nFields. To remedy this a clause was proposed, giving the College\r\npermission to have a place near to Newgate, where the part of the sentence\r\nwhich related to the dissection of the bodies might be carried out.\r\n\r\nThat this difficulty of moving the bodies was not a fancied one, the\r\nfollowing extract from \"Alderman Macaulay's Diary\" will show: \"Dec. 6,\r\n1796. Francis Dunn and Will. Arnold were yesterday executed for murder and\r\nthe first malefactors conveyed to the new Surgeons' Hall in the Lincoln's\r\nInn Fields. They were conveyed in a cart, their heads supported by tea\r\nchests for the public to see: I think contrary to all decency and the laws\r\nof humanity in a country like this. I hope it will not be repeated.\"[6]\r\n\r\nJust at this date the Corporation were removing from their old premises to\r\nLincoln's Inn Fields; the last Court in the Old Bailey was held on October\r\n6th, 1796, and the first at Lincoln's Inn Fields on January 5th, 1797.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1797, it was reported to the Court that Mr. Chandler, one of\r\ntheir members, \"had in the most polite and ready manner offered his stable\r\nfor the reception of the bodies of the two murderers who were executed\r\nlast month.\" The thanks of the Court were voted to Mr. Chandler \"for his\r\npolite attention to the Company upon that occasion.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Bill had been lost in the Lords, the following resolution was\r\npassed by the Court in November, 1797: \"Resolved that in order to evince\r\nthe sincerity of the Court to remove all reasonable objections to the\r\npresent situation in Lincoln's Inn Fields the Clerk be directed, with\r\nproper assistance, to look for a temporary dissecting-room at a place in\r\nor near the Old Bailey until a permanent one near the place of execution\r\ncan be established.\"\r\n\r\nIn June, 1800, a warehouse was taken in Castle Street, Cow Cross, West\r\nSmithfield, for eighteen months, as, owing to the labours of taking over\r\nthe Hunterian Collection, there had been no time for obtaining a permanent\r\nplace. A house in Duke Street, West Smithfield, was afterwards leased for\r\nthe purpose, and arrangements were made for Pass, the Beadle, to reside\r\nthere. This landed the College in a small expense, as in 1832 the Beadle\r\nwas elected Constable of the Ward of Farringdon, and the Council had to\r\npay a fine of £10 in place of his serving the office. At the expiration of\r\nthe lease of the Duke Street house, so great an increase of rent was\r\ndemanded that the College gave up the premises, and took a newly-built\r\nhouse in Hosier Lane, on a lease for twenty-one years. Here the\r\ndissections were carried on until the passing of the Anatomy Act, when the\r\nCollege had no longer to share with the hangman the duty of carrying out\r\nthe sentence on murderers who were condemned to be hanged and anatomized.\r\n\r\nThe bodies were not really dissected by the College Authorities; a\r\nsufficient incision was made to satisfy the requirements of the Act, and\r\nthe body was then handed over to one of the Teachers of Anatomy. The\r\nfollowing is a copy of an order authorizing the Secretary of the College\r\nto give up a body:\r\n\r\n     \"Ordered.\r\n\r\n     \"That the body of Mary Whittenbach executed this day at the Old\r\n     Bailey for murder be delivered (after the necessary dissection by the\r\n     College) to Mr. Joseph Henry Green.\r\n\r\n     \"WILLIAM BLIZARD\r\n     \"WM. NORRIS\r\n     \"ANTH{Y} CARLISLE.\r\n\r\n     \"Royal College of Surgeons\r\n             \"_17th day of Sept. 1827_\r\n     \"To Mr. BELFOUR, Secy. to the College.\"\r\n\r\nThere is in the Library of the Royal College of Surgeons of England a\r\nseries of drawings of the heads of murderers, made by the two Clifts,\r\nfather and son, when the bodies were brought to the College for\r\ndissection. These drawings include Bishop and Williams (see p. 107),[7]\r\nand Bellingham, who was executed in 1812 for the murder of Mr. Perceval\r\nin the lobby of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nEarl Ferrers, who suffered the extreme penalty of the law in 1760 for the\r\nmurder of his steward, was taken to Surgeons' Hall, where an incision was\r\nmade in the body; instead of being further dissected it was given over to\r\nthe relatives for burial.\r\n\r\nAt the execution of Bishop and Williams the Sheriffs of London felt that\r\nsome means should be taken to show gratitude to Mr. Partridge, and the\r\nother officials of King's College, for the way they had brought the\r\nmurderers to justice. The following letter was therefore addressed to the\r\nCollege of Surgeons:\r\n\r\n     \"JUSTICE HALL,\r\n     \"_Dec. 5, 1831._\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Governors and Directors of the College of Surgeons._\r\n\r\n     \"It is our particular desire and we do ask that it may be thought but\r\n     a reasonable request that the bodies of the malefactors executed in\r\n     the front of Newgate this morning should be sent to King's\r\n     College--by the vigilance of whose surgical establishment these\r\n     offenders were detected and ultimately brought to justice, we shall\r\n     therefore feel obliged by your handing over these bodies to the\r\n     King's College.\r\n\r\n     \"We are, with great respect,\r\n     \"Your mo. ob.

It was printed in\r\na series of articles, entitled \"Echoes from the College of Surgeons.\"[8]\r\n\r\n\"The executions generally took place at eight o'clock on Mondays, and the\r\n'cut down,' as it is called, at nine, although there was no cutting at\r\nall, as the rope, with a large knot at the end, was simply passed through\r\na thick and strong ring, with a screw, which firmly held the rope in its\r\nplace, and when all was over, Calcraft, _alias_ 'Jack Ketch,' would make\r\nhis appearance on the scaffold, and by simply turning the screw, the body\r\nwould fall down. At once it would be placed in one of those large carts\r\nwith collapsible sides, only to be seen in the neighbourhood of the Docks,\r\nand then preceded by the City Marshal in his cocked hat, and, in fact, all\r\nhis war paint, with Calcraft and his assistant in the cart, the procession\r\nwould make its way to 33 Hosier Lane, West Smithfield, in the front\r\ndrawing room of which were assembled Sir William Blizard, President of the\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons, and members of the Court desirous of being\r\npresent, with Messrs. Clift (senior and junior), Belfour, and myself. On\r\nextraordinary occasions visitors were admitted by special favour. The\r\nbodies would then be stripped, and the clothes removed by Calcraft as his\r\nvaluable perquisites, which, with the fatal rope, were afterwards\r\nexhibited to the morbidly curious, at so much per head, at some favoured\r\npublic-house. It was the duty of the City Marshal to be present to see the\r\nbody 'anatomised,' as the Act of Parliament had it. A crucial incision in\r\nthe chest was enough to satisfy the important City functionary above\r\nreferred to, and he would soon beat a hasty retreat, on his gaily-decked\r\ncharger, to report the due execution of his duty. These experiments\r\nconcluded, the body would be stitched up, and Pearson, an old museum\r\nattendant, would remove it in a light cart to the hospital, to which it\r\nwas intended to present it for dissection.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese bodies of murderers were the only ones which could be legally used\r\nfor dissection; it is therefore obvious that the number was quite\r\ninsufficient for the wants of the Metropolitan Schools, and the teachers\r\nwere thus forced to obtain a supply from other sources.\r\n\r\nIt was strongly urged, but urged in vain, that the whole difficulty would\r\ndisappear if a short Act were passed, doing away with the dissection of\r\nmurderers, and enacting that the bodies of all unknown persons who died in\r\nworkhouses or hospitals, without friends, should be handed over, under\r\nproper control, to the different teachers of anatomy. That these would be\r\nsufficient was afterwards made clear by the Committee on Anatomy.[9] In\r\ntheir Report it is stated that the returns obtained from 127 of the\r\nparishes situate in London, Westminster, and Southwark, or their immediate\r\nvicinity, showed that out of 3744 persons who died in the workhouses of\r\nthese parishes in the year 1827, 3103 were buried at the parish expense,\r\nand that of these about 1108 were not attended to their graves by any\r\nrelations. The number of bodies obtained from this source would have\r\nexceeded those supplied by the resurrection-men, and would have been\r\nadequate for the wants of the London Schools.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers of the day contain many proposed solutions of the\r\ndifficulty. One correspondent gravely suggested that as prostitutes had,\r\nby their bodies during life, been engaged in corrupting mankind, it was\r\nonly right that after death those bodies should be handed over to be\r\ndissected for the public good. Another correspondent proposed that all\r\nbodies of suicides should be used for dissection, and that all those\r\npersons who came to their death by duelling, prize-fighting, or\r\ndrunkenness, should be handed over to the surgeons for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Dermott, the proprietor of the Gerrard Street, or Little Windmill\r\nStreet, School of Medicine, proposed a scheme by which a fund was to be\r\nraised by grants from Government, and from the College of Surgeons, and by\r\nvoluntary contributions from the nobility and gentry. This fund was to be\r\ninvested in the names of \"opulent and respectable men,\" not more than\r\none-third of whom were to be members of the medical profession. It was\r\nproposed to expend the interest on this fund in paying a sum not exceeding\r\nseven pounds to those persons who were willing to contract for the sale of\r\ntheir bodies for dissection. Registers were to be kept of all such\r\npersons, and the Committee were to have the power of claiming the body six\r\nhours after death. Mr. Dermott also suggested that all medical men should\r\nleave their own bodies to be used for anatomical teaching. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to point out the absurdity of the first part of this scheme; the\r\nCommittee, after paying their seven pounds, would have had no control over\r\nthe subsequent movements of the persons whose bodies they had thus\r\npurchased, and it was hardly to be expected that friends of the deceased\r\nwould send notice to the Committee that the body was ready for them. Both\r\nparts of the scheme would have required an Act of Parliament, as executors\r\nwere not bound to give up a corpse, even though instructions had been left\r\nthat it was a person's wish that his body should be used for anatomical\r\npurposes. Many such bequests have been made, and in some instances the\r\ndesire of the testator has been carried into effect. To try to do away\r\nwith some of the prejudices against dissection, Jeremy Bentham left his\r\nbody for this purpose; the dissection was duly carried out at the Webb\r\nStreet School, and at the request of Dr. Southwood Smith, Mr. Grainger\r\ndelivered the following oration over the body on June 9th, 1832:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,--In presenting myself before you this day, at the request of\r\nmy friend and colleague, Dr. Southwood Smith, I can assure you I do so\r\nstrongly impressed with the high importance of the duty I have undertaken,\r\nand the responsibility I have thus assumed. Gentlemen, it is no ordinary\r\noccasion on which we are assembled. We are here collected to carry into\r\nexecution the last wishes of one whose mortal career, prolonged far beyond\r\nthe usual limits of man's existence, has been devoted with almost\r\nunexampled energy and perseverance to the establishment of those great\r\nmoral and political truths, on which the happiness and the enlightenment\r\nof the human race are founded. Ill would it become me, however, to dwell\r\non the genius, the philanthropy, or the integrity of the illustrious\r\ndeceased. His eulogium has already been eloquently pronounced by one more\r\nfitted to do justice to such an undertaking than the humble individual who\r\nnow addresses you. It would be more suitable to the object of the present\r\nmeeting that I should consider in what manner the intentions of the late\r\nMr. Bentham, regarding the disposition of his remains, can best be carried\r\ninto effect. But before I do this, it may be proper to inform some of my\r\nauditors what those intentions were. This great man was an ardent admirer\r\nof the science of medicine, and his penetrating mind was not slow in\r\nperceiving that the safe and successful practice of the healing art\r\nentirely rests on a thorough knowledge of the natural structure and\r\nfunctions of the human body. He also perceived that there was but one\r\nmethod of obtaining such knowledge, viz., dissection. In proceeding to\r\ninquire how it came to happen that in a country like England, justly proud\r\nof those numerous institutions in which science is so successfully\r\ncultivated, so little encouragement, or more correctly speaking, so much\r\nopposition, was offered to the advancement of so indispensable a branch of\r\nknowledge, Mr. Bentham discovered that this repugnance to dissection\r\nsprang from a feeling strongly implanted in the human breast--a feeling of\r\nreverence towards the dead. Far be it from me to condemn such a sentiment,\r\nfor it has its source in some of the purest principles of our nature. But\r\nif it can be shown that an undue indulgence in this feeling produces\r\nincalculable mischief in society, it becomes the duty of all who are\r\ninterested in the happiness of mankind to oppose the progress of such\r\ninjurious opinions. Mr. Bentham, impressed with this idea, and thinking it\r\nunjust that the humbler classes of the community should alone be called\r\nupon to sacrifice those feelings which are cherished alike by the rich and\r\npoor, determined to devote his own body to the public good. He knew that\r\nthis determination would inflict pain on many of his dearest friends. An\r\nexample of this character, emanating from a person so talented, so\r\ninfluential, and so esteemed, is calculated to operate a most beneficial\r\neffect on the public mind, and I cannot refrain from considering the\r\ndissection of the body now before us as an important era in the progress\r\nof anatomy, as it is one of the first that in this country has been\r\nemployed for the purposes of science, under the direct sanction of the\r\nindividual expressed during his lifetime; he also knew that obstacles\r\nwould probably be offered to its fulfilment, but with an indifference to\r\npersonal feeling rarely witnessed, he took effectual means to carry his\r\nresolution into effect. And thus, gentlemen, did the last act of this\r\nillustrious man's existence accord with that leading principle of his\r\nwell-spent life--the desire to promote the universal happiness and welfare\r\nof mankind.\"\r\n\r\nBentham's skeleton, clothed in his usual attire, is now in University\r\nCollege, London.\r\n\r\nMessenger Monsey, the eccentric physician to the Chelsea Hospital, was\r\nexceedingly anxious that his body should be examined after death. He\r\nobtained a promise from Mr. Forster, of Union Court, that he would\r\nperform this service for him. So anxious was Monsey for the _post mortem_\r\nto be carried out, that in May, 1787, he wrote to Cruikshank, the\r\nanatomist, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Foster (_sic_) a Surgeon in Union Court, Broad Street, has been\r\n     so good as to promise to open my Carcass and see what is the matter\r\n     with my Heart, Arteries, Kidnies, &c. He is gone to Norwich and may\r\n     not return before I am [dead]. Will you be so good as to let me send\r\n     it to you, or if he comes will you like to be present at the\r\n     dissection. I am now very ill and hardly see to scrawl this & feel as\r\n     if I should live two days, the sooner the better. I am, tho' unknown\r\n     to you\r\n\r\n     \"Your respectfull humble Servant\r\n     \"MESSR. MONSEY.\"\r\n\r\nMonsey lived until December 20th, 1788; his wishes were duly carried out\r\nby Mr. Forster, at Guy's Hospital, in the presence of the students.\r\n\r\nNinety-nine gentlemen of Dublin signed a document, in which the wish was\r\nexpressed that their bodies, instead of being interred, should be devoted\r\nby their surviving friends \"to the more rational, benevolent, and\r\nhonourable purpose of explaining the structure, functions and diseases of\r\nthe human being.\"\r\n\r\nA Mr. Boys, who died in 1835, wished to be made into \"essential salts\" for\r\nthe use of his female friends. In a letter to Dr. Campbell, written four\r\nyears before his death, he asks: \"Are you now disposed (without Burking)\r\nto accomplish my wish, when my breath or spirit shall have ceased to\r\nanimate my carcase, to perform the operation of vitrifying my bones, and\r\nsublimating the rest, thereby cheating the Devil of his due, according to\r\nthe ideas of some devotees among Christians? And, that I may not offend\r\nthe delicate olfactory nerves of my female friends with a mass of\r\nputridity, if it be possible, let me rather fill a few little bottles of\r\nessential salts therefrom, and revive their drooping spirits. It may be\r\nirksome to you to superintend the business, but, perhaps, you have\r\nknowledge of some rising genius or geniuses who may be glad of a subject\r\nwithout paying for it. Let them slash and cut, and divide, as best please\r\n'em.\"\r\n\r\nThe following account, taken from a newspaper of 1810, shows that\r\nuntoward events sometimes followed a request of this kind. A journeyman\r\ntailor died at the _Black Prince_, in Chandos Street, and directed, in his\r\nwill, that his body should be opened in the presence of Mr. Wood, the\r\nlandlord. This instruction was carried out. The paragraph goes on to say\r\nthat the dissection was scarcely concluded \"when the landlord, a stranger\r\nto such exhibitions, was seized with sickness and vomiting; and, on\r\nreaching the bar, was prevailed upon by his wife to take a glass of brandy\r\nand water; in a few minutes he was obliged to be carried to bed, never to\r\nrise again; on Friday last, the third day from the attack, he died in a\r\nstate of delirium, not from contagion, or a predisposition to disease, but\r\nsolely from the impression made upon his mind by the anatomical\r\nperformance, which, he observed, exceeded in horror any thing he had ever\r\nbeheld.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not an uncommon thing for persons to try to put into effect part of\r\nDermott's plan, by offering to leave their bodies for anatomical purposes,\r\non the condition that they were paid a certain sum down. This was\r\ngenerally only a swindling dodge, and one by which the teachers were not\r\nto be caught, as they could have no hold on the persons whose bodies they\r\npurchased, nor could they compel the friends to give them up after death.\r\nThe following letter, preserved amongst Sir Astley Cooper's papers, and\r\nnow forming part of the Stone Collection at the Royal College of Surgeons\r\nof England, is a specimen:\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,--I have been informed you are in the habit of purchasing bodys\r\n     and allowing the person a sum weekly; knowing a poor woman that is\r\n     desirous of doing so, I have taken the liberty of calling to know the\r\n     truth.\r\n\r\n     \"I remain, your humble servant.\"\r\n\r\n     [10]\r\n\r\nOn the back Sir Astley has written, \"The _truth_ is that you deserve to be\r\nhanged for such an unfeeling offer. A. C.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea at the present day has not died out; quite recently a man called\r\nat the College of Surgeons, and offered to sell his body for a cash\r\npayment. It is a fairly common experience of Curators of Pathological\r\nMuseums to have similar offers from persons suffering from a rare disease,\r\nor a curious deformity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORTSAFE IN GREYFRIARS CHURCHYARD, EDINBURGH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been stated in the previous chapter, there was no need of the\r\nresurrection-men, so long as the teaching of anatomy was confined to the\r\nCompany of Barbers and Surgeons. It has also been pointed out that, as\r\nlate as 1714, Cheselden was reprimanded for having anatomical\r\ndemonstrations at his private house. Soon after this date, however, began\r\nthe establishment of private schools. Mr. Nourse, of St. Bartholomew's,\r\nwas one of the first to deliver public lectures at his own house. After a\r\ntime this probably became inconvenient, as we find his advertisement, in\r\n1739, worded thus:\r\n\r\n     \"ANATOMY.\r\n\r\n     \"Designing to have no more lectures at my own house, I think it\r\n     proper to advertise that I shall begin a Course of Anatomy,\r\n     Chirurgical Operations and Bandages on Monday, the 11th of Nov., at\r\n     St. Bartholomew's Hospital.\r\n\r\n     \"EDW. NOURSE, Assistant Surgeon\r\n     and Lithotomist to the said Hospital.\"\r\n\r\nPercivall Pott, who was apprenticed to Nourse, followed his master's\r\nexample, and lectured on Surgery. In 1737 we find Dr. Fr. Nicholls\r\nadvertising thus:\r\n\r\n     \"On Wednesday, the 2nd of February, at the House below the Bull Head,\r\n     in Lincoln's Inn Fields, at five in the evening, will begin a Course\r\n     of Anatomy and Physiology, introductory to the study and practice of\r\n     Physick in all its branches by Fr. Nicholls, M.D. N.B. A compendium\r\n     referring to the several matters, explain'd in these Lectures, is\r\n     sold by John Clarke, under the Royal Exchange, and F. Woodward, at\r\n     the Half Moon, within Temple Bar, Booksellers.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the advertisement of Cæsar Hawkins, from a newspaper of\r\n1739:\r\n\r\n     \"In Pall Mall Court, in Pall Mall. On Thursday, the 5th of February\r\n     next, will begin a Course of Anatomy, with the principal Operations\r\n     in Surgery and their suitable Bandages, by Cæsar Hawkins, Surgeon to\r\n     St. George's Hospital.\"\r\n\r\nJoshua Brookes' advertisement, in 1814, ran as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"THEATRE OF ANATOMY, BLENHEIM STREET,\r\n     GREAT MARLBOROUGH STREET.\r\n\r\n     \"The Summer Course of Lectures on Anatomy, Physiology, and Surgery,\r\n     will be commenced on Monday, the 6th of June, at seven o'clock in\r\n     the morning. By Mr. Brookes.--Anatomical Converzationes will be held\r\n     weekly, when the different Subjects treated of will be discussed\r\n     familiarly, and the Students' views forwarded. To these none but\r\n     Pupils can be admitted. Spacious Apartments, thoroughly ventilated,\r\n     and replete with every convenience, will be open at five o'clock in\r\n     the morning, for the purposes of Dissecting and Injecting, when Mr.\r\n     Brookes attends to direct the Students and demonstrate the various\r\n     parts as they appear on Dissection.\r\n\r\n     \"The inconveniences usually attending Anatomical Investigations, are\r\n     counteracted by an antiseptic process. Pupils may be accommodated in\r\n     the House. Gentlemen established in Practice, desirous of renewing\r\n     their Anatomical Knowledge, may be accommodated with an apartment to\r\n     dissect in privately.\"\r\n\r\nA very interesting account of the old Anatomical Schools, by Mr. D'Arcy\r\nPower, will be found in the _British Medical Journal_, 1895, vol. 2, p.\r\n141. The paper is entitled \"The Rise and Fall of the Private Medical\r\nSchools in London.\" It has been reprinted, with other articles, in a\r\npamphlet, entitled _The Medical Institutions of London_.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, as no licence was required for opening an Anatomical\r\nSchool, there was no limit to their number; there was also no regular\r\nlegal supply of subjects, except the bodies of murderers, executed in\r\nLondon and the county of Middlesex, which came to the schools through the\r\nCollege of Surgeons. In Paris a licence had to be obtained before opening\r\nan Anatomical School, and bodies were regularly supplied to the licensed\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nWith the rise and competition of the Medical Schools in London, the\r\ndifficulty of getting an adequate number of bodies increased. The absolute\r\nnecessity of having a good supply for the use of students, so as to\r\nprevent them from going off to rival schools, caused the teachers to offer\r\nlarge prices, and thus made it worth while for men to devote themselves\r\nentirely to obtaining bodies for this purpose. At first the trade was\r\ncarried on by a very few men, and without any public scandal, but the\r\ninducements mentioned above enticed others into the business; these were\r\nof the lowest class, often professed thieves, and the fights and disputes\r\nof these men, one with the other, in churchyards, often made really more\r\nscandal than the actual stealing of the bodies. It was stated by the\r\npolice in 1828 that the number of persons who, in London, lived regularly\r\non the profits of exhumation, did not exceed ten; but there were, in\r\naddition to these, about two hundred who were occasionally employed. These\r\nlatter individuals were thieves of the lowest grade, and the most\r\ndesperate and abandoned class of the community. The men worked generally\r\nin gangs, and would do anything to spoil the success of their opponents in\r\nthe business. If a body were bought by one of the teachers from an outside\r\nsource, the regular men would sometimes break into the dissecting-room and\r\ncut the body in such a manner as to make it useless for anatomical\r\npurposes. If this could not be done, they would give information to the\r\npolice that a stolen body was lying in a certain dissecting-room. Joshua\r\nBrookes, the proprietor of the Blenheim Street, or Great Marlborough\r\nStreet, School, was a victim in this way; a body, for which he had paid 16\r\nguineas, was taken away from his school through information of this kind,\r\nand the police officer who carried out the business was, as a reward for\r\nhis efforts, presented with a silver staff, purchased by public\r\nsubscription. Brookes seems to have got on very badly with the\r\nresurrection-men; at one time, because he refused five guineas as a\r\ndouceur at the beginning of the session, two dead bodies, in a high state\r\nof decomposition, were dropped at night close to his school by the men\r\nwhom he had thus offended; one of these bodies was placed at the Poland\r\nStreet end of Great Marlborough Street, and the other at the end of\r\nBlenheim Street. Two young ladies stumbled over one of these bodies, and\r\nat once raised such a commotion that, had it not been for the prompt\r\nassistance of Sir Robert Baker and the police, Brookes would have fared\r\nvery badly at the hands of the mob which soon collected. The fact of his\r\nhouse being near to the Marlborough Police Court, on more than one\r\noccasion saved Brookes from the popular fury.\r\n\r\nA subject was brought to him one day in a sack, and paid for at once; soon\r\nafter it was discovered that the occupant of the sack was alive. This was\r\nnot a case of attempted murder; the \"subject\" was a confederate of those\r\nfrom whom he had been purchased, and had, in all probability, been thus\r\nintroduced to the premises for purposes of burglary.\r\n\r\nThe competition of the schools had risen to such a height in the demand\r\nfor bodies, that Brookes stated that for a subject, which would have cost\r\ntwo guineas in his student days, he had paid as much as sixteen guineas.\r\nNor was the cost of the body the only expense to the teacher. At the\r\nbeginning of each session he was waited upon by the resurrection-men, who\r\noffered to supply him regularly with bodies at a fixed price, on the\r\ncondition that a douceur was paid down at once. The teachers were\r\npowerless in the matter, and had either to accede to the offered terms, or\r\nto lose their students through not having a sufficient supply of subjects.\r\nThe scarcity of bodies was most keenly felt at the beginning of the\r\nsession; the resurrection-men knew that they could command their own\r\nterms, and would not supply any subjects until the teachers had conceded\r\nall their demands. This was felt to be bad for the students, and Dr. James\r\nSomerville, who was assistant to Brodie at the Great Windmill Street\r\nSchool, in giving evidence before the Committee on Anatomy, said that\r\n\"the pupils not being able to proceed for a certain time lose their\r\nardour, and get into habits of idleness.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the session the resurrection-men again waited on the\r\nproprietors of the schools, and demanded \"finishing money.\" In some papers\r\nrelating to Sir Astley Cooper, which were referred to in a letter\r\npublished in the _Medical Times_, 1883, vol. 1, p. 343, we read: \"May\r\n10th, 1827, Paid Hollis, Vaughan, and Llewellyn, finishing money, £6 6s.\r\n0d. 1829, June 18th, Paid Murphy, Wildes, & Naples, finishing money £6 6s.\r\n0d.\"\r\n\r\nThe cost of the bodies in this way to the teachers was more than they\r\ncould charge to the students, and the deficiency thus created was made up\r\nby increased fees for the lectures. The expenses, moreover, did not end\r\nhere. If one of the resurrection-men was unfortunate enough to get a term\r\nof imprisonment, the teacher had to partly keep the man's wife and family\r\nwhilst he was serving his sentence. A solatium was also expected on his\r\nrelease from gaol. Mr. R. D. Grainger spent £50 in this way for one man,\r\nand several guineas in keeping the family of another Resurrectionist\r\nwhilst the latter was in gaol. Sir Astley Cooper is known to have spent\r\nlarge sums of money for a similar purpose. The following may be cited as\r\nexamples: \"January 29th, 1828, Paid Mr. Cock to pay Mr. South half the\r\nexpenses of bailing Vaughan from Yarmouth and going down £14 7s. 0d. 1829,\r\nMay 6th, Paid Vaughan's wife 6s. Paid Vaughan for twenty-six weeks'\r\nconfinement at 10s. per week, £13 0s. 0d.\"\r\n\r\nIf any independence were shown by the teachers, and the demands of the men\r\nresisted, victory generally fell to the lot of the Resurrectionists. A\r\nteacher, perhaps, would refuse to pay the exorbitant demands, and would\r\nemploy other men to obtain bodies for him. These were then watched by the\r\nregular gang, and information to the police was laid against them on every\r\noccasion. The bodies obtained by the irregular men were often taken from\r\nthem by those who considered they had a monopoly in the business; these\r\nsubjects were then hacked and cut about so as to make them quite useless\r\nfor anatomical purposes. So the supply at this particular school would be\r\nvery short, and great indignation would arise amongst the students, who\r\nhad paid their fees, and therefore demanded an adequate number of bodies\r\nfor dissection. The teacher was thus obliged to give way, and to accede to\r\nthe demands of the regular gang.\r\n\r\nThe teachers formed themselves into an Anatomical Club for their own\r\nprotection; by this means it was hoped to regulate the price to be paid\r\nfor bodies, by agreement amongst the members of the Club not to give more\r\nthan a certain amount. This agreement does not seem, according to Mr.\r\nSouth, to have been very faithfully kept, and so, with new schools\r\nspringing up and giving rise to still greater competition, the teachers\r\nwere as much as ever in the hands of the resurrection-men.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that all the bodies which were supplied to the\r\nschools were exhumed. Many of them were stolen or obtained by false\r\npretences before burial. Glennon, the police officer, who has been before\r\nmentioned in connection with Joshua Brookes, told the Committee that he\r\nhad recovered between fifty and a hundred bodies for persons who had had\r\ntheir houses broken open, and bodies stolen from them whilst in the\r\ncoffin awaiting burial. The following case, tried at the London Sessions\r\nin 1830, is an example of this:\r\n\r\n\"LONDON ADJOURNED SESSIONS.\r\n\r\n\"TUESDAY.--BODY-SNATCHING.--A well-known pilferer of graves, named Clarke,\r\nwas tried upon an indictment, charging him with having stolen the body of\r\na dead child, aged about four years, which had been under the care of a\r\nnurse named Mary Hopkins. The facts which came out in evidence are as\r\nfollows: The deceased was the daughter of a woman of the town, residing in\r\nShire Lane, and had been kept at the nurse's lodging, which was in the\r\nsame neighbourhood. She died on a Friday, and Clarke, whose ears were\r\ndescribed as 'quick to the toll of the passing bell,' paid the nurse a\r\nvisit the next morning, under pretence of hiring a cellar under the house.\r\nHe took occasion to notice the poor woman's son; said it was a pity to see\r\nthe boy idle, and that he should have immediate employment, and called\r\nagain with evidences of still stronger interest in favour of the family.\r\n'By the way,' said he, 'I understand you have had a death lately.' 'Yes,\r\nsir,' said the nurse, 'a poor little girl is departed.' 'Poor little\r\ndear,' cried the snatcher, 'I should like to look at the little innocent.'\r\nHe was forthwith led into the front parlour, where the body lay in a\r\ncoffin, and observing that its position was favourable to his intention,\r\nhe sympathized with the nurse, and said, 'We must all come to this sooner\r\nor later,' and then he went to get a half-pint of summut to comfort them.\r\nThe nurse disposed of a glass, which presently set her in a profound\r\nsleep, and when she awoke the body of the babe was gone. It appeared that\r\nthe snatcher, after having quitted the house, as if for good, returned,\r\nand opening the parlour-window hooked out with a stick the corpse of the\r\nchild, and went off with it towards a market that is open at all hours,\r\nnear Bridgewater Square. However, a police officer, who knew his trade,\r\nlaid hands upon him, telling him he was wanted. The snatcher then threw\r\ndown the child and took to his heels, but was apprehended and lodged in\r\nthe Compter. The nurse proved the identity of the body. Upon her\r\ncross-examination, by Mr. Payne, she stated that the mother had not been\r\nto see the deceased for four or five days before the death. The Jury\r\nreturned a verdict of Guilty, but some of them audibly spoke of\r\nrecommending the prisoner to mercy, but made no appendage to that effect.\r\nThe Recorder sentenced the prisoner to be imprisoned for the space of six\r\ncalendar months.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes these stolen bodies were claimed after payment had been made to\r\nthe resurrection-men, but before any dissection had taken place. The\r\nfollowing refers to Guy's Hospital: \"Returned to Vestry Clerk of\r\nNewington, by order of the Treasurer, one male and two females, purchased\r\nof Page, &c., on the 25th, who had broken open the dead-house to obtain\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nBodies of suicides, and of those who had met with an accidental death,\r\nwere frequently stolen whilst they were awaiting the coroner's inquest.\r\nOften in these cases the body-thieves, after selling the subject to a\r\nteacher of anatomy, secretly gave information to the police where the\r\nmissing body might be found. It was then seized by the police, and, after\r\nthe inquest, handed over to those who claimed to be relatives; these\r\nsupposed relatives were frequently confederates of the thieves, and by\r\nthem the body was at once taken off and again sold to another teacher.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following case is from a newspaper of 1823:\r\n\r\n\"SUICIDE AND THE BODY STOLEN.--Tuesday evening last a young woman of\r\nrespectable and interesting appearance was observed for some time parading\r\nthe banks of the Surrey Canal, Camberwell, in a melancholy mood, and at\r\nlength she plunged into the water; on which a man rushed in after her and\r\ndived several times, but failed in recovering the body, which was not\r\nfound till the following morning, when it was taken to the Albany Arms,\r\nnear the Canal, for the Coroner's inquest, which was to have taken place\r\non Thursday. On the landlord proceeding to the shed on Wednesday morning,\r\nwhere the body had been deposited, he discovered, that in the course of\r\nthe night, it had been broken open, and the corpse of the female stolen\r\naway. He instantly repaired to the Police Office, Union Street, and gave\r\ninformation of the circumstance to the Magistrates, who gave orders that\r\nimmediate inquiry should be made at Mr. Brookes's, where the body has\r\nsince been discovered and given up. The poor woman was unclaimed, and the\r\nverdict of the Coroner's Jury was 'Found Drowned.'\"\r\n\r\nA favourite trick, in the carrying out of which a woman was generally\r\nnecessary, was that of claiming the bodies of friendless persons who died\r\nin workhouses, or similar institutions. Immediately it was found out that\r\nsuch an one was dead a man and woman, decently clad in mourning, in great\r\ngrief, and often in tears, called at the workhouse to take away the body\r\nof their dear departed relative. If the trick proved successful, as it\r\noften did, the body was taken straight off to one of the schools and sold.\r\nThe parish authorities, probably, were not over particular about giving up\r\nthe body, if the deceased were a stranger, as by this means they saved the\r\ncost of burial.\r\n\r\nSubjects, too, were obtained from cheap undertakers, who kept the bodies\r\nof the poor until the time for burial. The coffin was weighted so as to\r\nconceal the fraud, and the mockery of reading the Burial Service over it\r\nwas gone through in the presence of the unsuspecting relatives.\r\n\r\nThat some bodies were obtained by murder there can be no doubt. The\r\nexposure caused by the trials of Burke and Hare in Edinburgh, and Bishop\r\nand Williams in London, proves this.\r\n\r\nThe facts previously stated, however, go very far to exonerate the\r\nanatomists from the false charge (freely made at the time) of their being\r\nprivy to these murders. It has been frequently stated that signs of murder\r\ncould be easily seen, and that the fact of the body being fresh, and there\r\nbeing no evidence of its having been interred, ought to have at once\r\nsuggested foul play, and to have caused the teacher to communicate with\r\nthe police. But it must be remembered that the murders were generally very\r\nartfully contrived by suffocation, so as to leave no outward signs of\r\nill-treatment. It was also no uncommon thing, for the reasons just given,\r\nto receive at the schools bodies in quite a fresh state, which had\r\nevidently never received sepulture.\r\n\r\nAn account of the _post mortem_ on the Italian boy, for whose murder\r\nBishop and Williams were hanged,[11] has been preserved by Mr.\r\nClarke.[12] The examination of the body was carried out by Mr.\r\nWetherfield, of Southampton Street. There were also present Mr. Mayo,\r\nLecturer on Anatomy at King's College; Mr. Partridge, his demonstrator;\r\nMr. Beaman, Parish Surgeon; and his Assistant, Mr. D. Edwards, and Mr.\r\nClarke. The boy's teeth had been removed and sold to a dentist, but beyond\r\nthis there were no external marks of violence on any part of the body. The\r\ninternal organs were carefully examined, but no trace of injury or poison\r\ncould be found. Mr. Mayo, who had a peculiar way of standing very upright\r\nwith his hands in his breeches' pockets, said, with a kind of lisp he had,\r\n\"By Jove! the boy died a nathral death.\" Mr. Partridge and Mr. Beaman,\r\nhowever, suggested that the spine had not been examined, and after a\r\nconsultation it was decided to do this. It was then found that one or more\r\nof the upper cervical vertebræ were fractured. \"By Jove!\" said Mr. Mayo,\r\n\"this boy was murthered.\" The conviction of Bishop and Williams was due,\r\nin a very great measure, to Mr. Partridge and Mr. Beaman.\r\n\r\nAt the present day it is well-nigh impossible to understand the relations\r\nbetween men of honour and education, such as the teachers of anatomy were,\r\nand the ruffians who carried on this ghastly trade. It must, however, be\r\nborne in mind that, until the passing of the Anatomy Act in 1832, there\r\nwas no provision for supplying the means by which the student might be\r\ntaught this necessary part of his professional education; the only way in\r\nwhich teachers could get material for giving instruction was by dealing\r\nwith the resurrection-men.\r\n\r\nIt would have been quite impossible for the resurrection-men to have\r\nobtained the number of bodies they frequently did, had they not been able\r\nto bribe the custodians of the different burial-grounds. Sometimes they\r\nmet with a difficulty in the shape of a keeper newly appointed to replace\r\none who had been dismissed for being privy to these depredations. In most\r\ninstances this was soon overcome; if, at the outset, the custodian could\r\nnot be bribed, he could generally be induced to drink, and then, whilst he\r\nwas in a state of intoxication, the body which the resurrection-men wished\r\nto obtain could be easily removed. After this first step there was\r\ngenerally very little difficulty in the future.\r\n\r\nSometimes, too, the grave-diggers not only gave information to the\r\nResurrectionists, but acted as principals themselves. In Benson's\r\n_Remarkable Trials_ is recorded the case of John Holmes, Peter Williams,\r\nand Esther Donaldson. Holmes was grave-digger at St. George's, Bloomsbury;\r\nWilliams was his assistant, and Donaldson was charged as an accomplice.\r\nThey were prosecuted before Sir John Hawkins at the Guildhall,\r\nWestminster, in December, 1777, for stealing the body of Mrs. Jane\r\nSainsbury, who died in the previous October, and was buried in the St.\r\nGeorge's burial-ground. Holmes and Williams were sentenced to six months'\r\nimprisonment, and to be whipped on their bare backs from the end of\r\nKingsgate Street, Holborn, to Dyot Street, St. Giles. The sentence, says\r\nBenson, was duly carried out amidst crowds of well-satisfied and approving\r\nspectators. The woman Donaldson was acquitted.\r\n\r\nThe ranks of the resurrection-men were largely recruited from the keepers\r\nof burial-grounds. When these men had lost their situations for\r\nconnivance at the stealing of bodies, they naturally joined their old\r\nassociates, and became part of the regular gang.\r\n\r\nThe bribery of the custodians will account for the large number of bodies\r\noften obtained in one night. Had there been the slightest vigilance on the\r\npart of the authorities, it would have been absolutely impossible for the\r\nresurrection-men to have spent the time necessary for their work without\r\ndetection. The amount of time required for the work depended greatly on\r\nthe soil. One man told Bransby Cooper that he had taken two bodies from\r\nseparate graves of considerable depth, and had restored the coffins and\r\nthe earth to their former positions in an hour and a half. Another man\r\nsaid that he had completed the exhumation of a body in a quarter of an\r\nhour; but in this instance the grave was extremely shallow, and the earth\r\nloose and without stones. If much gravel had to be dug through, the\r\nresurrection-men had a peculiar way of using their spades, so that the\r\ngravel was thrown out of the grave quite noiselessly.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, February 20th, 1812, the Diary tells us that 15 large bodies\r\nand one small one were obtained from St. Pancras. No doubt this was\r\nsimplified by the custom of burying several paupers in one grave. To\r\nobtain these it was necessary to dig all the earth out, so that each\r\ncoffin could be dealt with; the men generally worked very soon after a\r\nfuneral, and so the earth was much more easily moved than it would have\r\nbeen if they had been obliged to dig through undisturbed ground. When only\r\none body was to be had, a small opening was dug down to the head of the\r\ncoffin, which was then broken open, and the body was pulled up with a\r\nrope, fastened either round the neck or under the armpits.\r\n\r\nIn a memoir of Thomas Wakley, the founder of _The Lancet_,[13] the\r\nfollowing account of the _modus operandi_ of the resurrection-men is\r\ngiven: \"In the case of a neat, or not quite new grave, the ingenuity of\r\nthe Resurrectionist came into play. Several feet--fifteen or twenty--away\r\nfrom the head or foot of the grave, he would remove a square of turf,\r\nabout eighteen or twenty inches in diameter. This he would carefully put\r\nby, and then commence to mine. Most pauper graves were of the same depth,\r\nand, if the sepulchre was that of a person of importance, the depth of the\r\ngrave could be pretty well estimated by the nature of the soil thrown up.\r\nTaking a five-foot grave, the coffin lid would be about four feet from the\r\nsurface. A rough slanting tunnel, some five yards long, would, therefore,\r\nhave to be constructed, so as to impinge exactly on the coffin head. This\r\nbeing at last struck (no very simple task), the coffin was lugged up by\r\nhooks to the surface, or, preferably, the end of the coffin was wrenched\r\noff with hooks while still in the shelter of the tunnel, and the scalp or\r\nfeet of the corpse secured through the open end, and the body pulled out,\r\nleaving the coffin almost intact and unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"The body once obtained, the narrow shaft was easily filled up and the sod\r\nof turf accurately replaced. The friends of the deceased, seeing that the\r\nearth _over_ his grave was not disturbed, would flatter themselves that\r\nthe body had escaped the Resurrectionist; but they seldom noticed the\r\nneatly-placed square of turf, some feet away.\"\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar account is given in the _Memorials of John Flint\r\nSouth_.[14] This method is also referred to by Bransby Cooper,[15] who\r\nstates that it was told him by one \"who fancied he had found out their\r\nsecret, but had, no doubt, been deceived by some of them purposely.\"\r\nBransby Cooper also says that he asked one of the principal\r\nresurrection-men as to the feasibility of this method, and the man showed\r\nhim several objections to it, and stated that \"it would never do.\" This\r\nstatement was made after the resurrection-days were over, when there could\r\nbe no advantage in keeping the true plan secret. It must be remembered\r\nthat there were some amateur body-snatchers, and that it was not at all\r\nunlikely that the regular men would tell to them a plan as full of\r\ndifficulties as that quoted above. To make the tunnel as described, would\r\nbe impossible, and it is somewhat difficult to see how grappling-irons\r\nwere fastened to the coffin; a man could hardly get down a tunnel 18 in.\r\nin diameter and 15 feet in length to do this; if he did succeed, his\r\ndifficulties in returning must have been still greater. To pull a body\r\nout of the head or foot of a coffin, as described, is an impossibility. No\r\nallowance is made, either, in digging the tunnel for obstacles, in the\r\nshape of intervening graves or grave-stones. As regards the evidence on\r\nthe surface of a grave having been disturbed, it would be greater in one\r\nopened in this manner than if the recently-disturbed earth had been again\r\ndug out. It would be impossible to get back into the tunnel all the earth\r\ndug out in the course of its construction, and this loose earth would at\r\nonce attract attention. Generally, bodies were removed before the graves\r\nwere finally tidied up, so that it was difficult to notice a fresh\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the Diary was a cemetery-keeper when he first began his\r\nresurrection proceedings; his _modus operandi_, in some cases, was to take\r\nthe body out of the coffin, and place it in a sack, before he began to\r\nfill in the grave. Then, as he gradually threw the earth in, he kept\r\npulling the sack to the surface, so that when his work of filling in was\r\ncompleted, he had the sack close to the top of the grave. He had then only\r\nto wait until night, when he was able, under cover of the darkness, to\r\nremove the body without fear of detection. When the resurrection-men had\r\nbeen successful in their night's work, they were glad to find a temporary\r\nshelter for the bodies, as near at hand as possible. This was generally an\r\nout-house belonging to one of the schools which they regularly supplied;\r\nthe men were permitted to place the bodies there for the night, and to\r\nfetch them away the next day. This explains some of the entries in the\r\nDiary, such as \"Took the whole to ----,\" and the next day, \"Removed the\r\nwhole from ----.\" Before removing any of the bodies, the men would find\r\nout exactly where they were wanted, and so would save much risk of being\r\narrested with the bodies in their possession.\r\n\r\nIf the following broadside could be believed, the resurrection-men\r\nsometimes performed a valuable service to those who had been buried--\r\n\r\n\"MIRACULOUS CIRCUMSTANCE:\r\n\r\n\"_Being a full and particular account of John Macintire, who was buried\r\nalive, in Edinburgh, on the 15th day of April, 1824, while in a trance,\r\nand who was taken up by the resurrection-men, and sold to the doctors to\r\nbe dissected, with a full account of the many strange and wonderful things\r\nwhich he saw and felt while he was in that state, the whole being taken\r\nfrom his own words._\r\n\r\n\"I had been some time ill of a low and lingering fever. My strength\r\ngradually wasted, and I could see by the doctor that I had nothing to\r\nhope. One day, towards evening, I was seized with strange and\r\nindescribable quiverings. I saw around my bed, innumerable strange faces;\r\nthey were bright and visionary, and without bodies. There was light and\r\nsolemnity, and I tried to move, but could not; I could recollect, with\r\nperfectness, but the power of motion had departed. I heard the sound of\r\nweeping at my pillow, and the voice of the nurse say, 'He is dead.' I\r\ncannot describe what I felt at these words. I exerted my utmost power to\r\nstir myself, but I could not move even an eyelid. My father drew his hand\r\nover my face and closed my eyelids. The world was then darkened, but I\r\ncould still hear, and feel and suffer. For three days a number of friends\r\ncalled to see me. I heard them in low accents speak of what I was, and\r\nmore than one touched me with his finger. The coffin was then procured,\r\nand I was laid in it. I felt the coffin lifted and borne away. I heard and\r\nfelt it placed in the hearse; it halted, and the coffin was taken out. I\r\nfelt myself carried on the shoulders of men; I heard the cords of the\r\ncoffin moved. I felt it swing as dependent by them. It was lowered and\r\nrested upon the bottom of the grave. Dreadful was the effort I then made\r\nto exert the power of action, but my whole frame was immovable. The sound\r\nof the rattling mould as it covered me, was far more tremendous than\r\nthunder. This also ceased, and all was silent. This is death, thought I,\r\nand soon the worms will be crawling about my flesh. In the contemplation\r\nof this hideous thought, I heard a low sound in the earth over me, and I\r\nfancied that the worms and reptiles were coming. The sound continued to\r\ngrow louder and nearer. Can it be possible, thought I, that my friends\r\nsuspect that they have buried me too soon? The hope was truly like\r\nbursting through the gloom of death. The sound ceased. They dragged me out\r\nof the coffin by the head, and carried me swiftly away. When borne to\r\nsome distance, I was thrown down like a clod, and by the interchange of\r\none or two brief sentences, I discovered that I was in the hands of two of\r\nthose robbers, who live by plundering the grave, and selling the bodies of\r\nparents, and children, and friends. Being rudely stripped of my shroud, I\r\nwas placed naked on a table. In a short time I heard by the bustle in the\r\nroom that the doctors and students were assembling. When all was ready the\r\nDemonstrator took his knife, and pierced my bosom. I felt a dreadful\r\ncrackling, as it were, throughout my whole frame; a convulsive shudder\r\ninstantly followed, and a shriek of horror rose from all present. The ice\r\nof death was broken up; my trance was ended. The utmost exertions were\r\nmade to restore me, and in the course of an hour I was in full possession\r\nof all my faculties.\r\n\r\n\"STEPHENSON, PRINTER, GATESHEAD.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was quite necessary for the Committee on Anatomy to adopt some means to\r\nprotect the resurrection-men who gave evidence before it; this was done\r\nby suppressing their names, and using letters of the alphabet to\r\ndistinguish the witnesses one from another. Popular feeling was so bitter\r\nagainst these men that they were often severely handled by the mob.\r\nSometimes the mob made a mistake, and the innocent suffered for the\r\nguilty. In 1823 a coach containing an empty coffin was being drawn along\r\nthe streets of Edinburgh; the people, suspecting that it was intended to\r\nconvey a body, taken from some churchyard, seized the coach; it was with\r\ngreat difficulty that the police rescued the driver from the fury of the\r\nmob. The coach they could not save; it was taken through the streets,\r\nthrown over a mound, and smashed; the people then kindled a fire with the\r\nfragments, and danced round it. It turned out that the coffin was intended\r\nto convey to his house, in Edinburgh, the body of a physician who had died\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion two American gentlemen, who were looking at the Abbey\r\nof Linlithgow after nightfall, were mistaken for resurrection-men, and\r\nassaulted by the mob.\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses, called \"A. B.,\" but who was probably Ben Crouch\r\nhimself, stated that twenty-three in four nights was the greatest number\r\nhe had ever obtained. He added, \"When I go to work, I like to get those of\r\npoor people buried from the workhouses, because instead of working for one\r\nsubject, you may get three or four. I do not think, during the time I have\r\nbeen in the habit of working for the schools, I got half a dozen of\r\nwealthier people.\" Another witness, who is called \"C. D.,\" but who was,\r\nwithout doubt, the writer of the Diary, stated that, \"according to my\r\nbook,\" in 1809 and 1810 the number of bodies disposed of in England was\r\n305 adults and 44 small; but the same year 37 were sent to Edinburgh, and\r\nthe gang had 18 in hand, which were never used at all. In 1810-11, 312\r\nadults were disposed of in the regular session, and 20 in the summer, in\r\naddition to 47 smalls. In the Report of the Committee in 1828, it was\r\npointed out that, at that time, there were over 800 students attending the\r\nSchools of Anatomy in London, but of these not more than 500 actually\r\nworked at dissection. The number of subjects annually available for\r\ninstruction amounted to between 450 and 500, or rather less than one for\r\neach student.\r\n\r\nThe average price of an adult body was stated to be £4 4s. 0d. It may be\r\nhere explained that a \"small\" was a body under three feet long; these were\r\nsold at so much per inch and were generally classified as \"large small,\"\r\n\"small,\" and \"foetus.\" The earnings of the resurrection-men may be\r\ngathered from the above entry. To take the year 1810-11, the receipts for\r\nbodies alone come to 1328 guineas; this is exclusive of \"smalls,\" and\r\nprobably also of the teeth, in which these men did a large trade. Teeth,\r\nin those days, were very valuable; the amounts received by some of the men\r\nfor teeth only will be dealt with in the chapter containing biographical\r\nnotices of some of the principal London resurrection-men. It may be here\r\nmentioned that on one occasion Murphy obtained the entry to a vault\r\nbelonging to a meeting-house, on the pretence of selecting a burial-place\r\nfor his wife. Whilst in there he managed to slip back some bolts, so that\r\nhe could easily gain an entrance at another time; this he did at night,\r\nand got possession of teeth by which he made £60.\r\n\r\nFrom the statements of the teachers it is most likely that £4 4s. 0d. is\r\nunder the average price paid for bodies. It must be remembered, too, that\r\nthis amount does not include the retaining-fee paid at the beginning of\r\nthe session, nor the \"finishing-money\" which was demanded at its close.\r\nThe 1328 guineas spoken of above would be divided amongst six or seven\r\npersons, and this, for men in their position, was a large income. The\r\nbiographical notes of the chief workers in this horrible trade will show\r\nthat some few of them did save money. Taking them, however, as a whole,\r\nthey were a dissolute and ruffianly gang; reference to the Diary proves\r\ntheir drunken habits, and there is more than one entry to show that they\r\nwere often in pecuniary difficulties; so much so that on one occasion they\r\nwere obliged to have recourse to Mordecai, the Jew.\r\n\r\nIt was quite useless for those who had just buried a relative or friend to\r\ndepend either upon the custodian of the burial-ground, or upon the watch,\r\nto see that the newly-made grave was not violated. The resurrection-men\r\noften met with a guard, instituted by the friends of the deceased, who\r\nwould take it in turns to watch by the grave-side through the whole\r\nnight; these friends were frequently armed, and were not afraid to use\r\ntheir arms if the resurrection-men gave them an opportunity. As a rule the\r\nbody-snatchers made off when they found a guard in the cemetery; it was to\r\ntheir interest not to create a riot, and if they were strong enough to\r\ndrive off the watchers, the latter could soon raise a tumult, whereby the\r\nbodily safety of the thieves would be endangered.\r\n\r\nMatters did not always pass off so peaceably, particularly in Ireland, as\r\nthe following extract from an Irish newspaper for 1830 shows:\r\n\r\n\"DESPERATE ENGAGEMENT WITH BODY-SNATCHERS.--The remains of the late Edward\r\nBarrett, Esq., having been interred in Glasnevin churchyard on the 27th of\r\nlast month (January), persons were appointed to remain in the churchyard\r\nall night, to protect the corpse from 'the sack 'em-up gentlemen,' and it\r\nseems the precaution was not unnecessary, for, on Saturday night last,\r\nsome of the gentry made their appearance, but soon decamped on finding\r\nthey were likely to be opposed. Nothing daunted, however, they returned on\r\nTuesday morning with augmented force, and well armed. About ten minutes\r\nafter two o'clock three or four of them were observed standing on the wall\r\nof the churchyard, while several others were endeavouring to get on it\r\nalso. The party in the churchyard warned them off, and were replied to by\r\na discharge from fire-arms. This brought on a general engagement; the sack\r\n'em-up gentlemen fired from behind the churchyard wall, by which they were\r\ndefended, while their opponents on the watch fired from behind the\r\ntomb-stones. Upwards of 58 to 60 shots were fired. One of the assailants\r\nwas shot--he was seen to fall; his body was carried off by his companions.\r\nSome of them are supposed to have been severely wounded, as a great\r\nquantity of blood was observed outside the churchyard wall,\r\nnotwithstanding the ground was covered with snow. During the firing, which\r\ncontinued for upwards of a quarter of an hour, the church bell was rung by\r\none of the watchmen, which, with the discharge from the fire-arms,\r\ncollected several of the townspeople and the police to the spot--several\r\nof the former, notwithstanding the severity of the weather, in nearly a\r\nstate of nakedness; but the assailants were by this time defeated, and\r\neffected their retreat. Several of the head-stones bear evident marks of\r\nthe conflict, being struck with the balls, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORTSAFE IN GREYFRIARS CHURCHYARD, EDINBURGH.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the disgraceful riots which took place in the burial-grounds, were\r\nnot between resurrection-men and friends guarding a grave, but between two\r\ngangs of body-snatchers. In cases of this kind one gang would do all in\r\nits power to bring its rival into disrepute; the stronger party, after\r\ndriving the weaker one away, would put the burial-ground into a most\r\ndisgraceful state, and then give information against their opponents.\r\n\r\nBesides watching, many other devices were tried to prevent the\r\ndepredations of the resurrection-men; spring guns were set in many of the\r\ncemeteries, but these were often rendered harmless. If the men intended\r\ngoing to a certain grave at night, late in the afternoon a woman, in deep\r\nmourning, would walk round the part of the cemetery in which the grave was\r\nsituated, and contrive to detach the wires from the guns. Loose stones\r\nwere placed on the walls of the grave-yard, so as to make scaling the\r\nwalls almost an impossibility; this was useless when the custodian had a\r\nhouse with a window looking into the burial-place. If entrance could not\r\nbe obtained in this way, there was generally some other house through\r\nwhich the men could gain admission to the grave-yard. Mort-safes, or\r\nstrong iron guards, were placed over newly-made graves for protection;\r\nsome of these can be seen at the present day in the Greyfriars Churchyard,\r\nEdinburgh (see illustrations).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MORTSAFE IN GREYFRIARS CHURCHYARD, EDINBURGH.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIron coffins were also used by some persons to protect their friends from\r\nthe Resurrectionist. The following interesting advertisement appeared in\r\n_Wooler's British Gazette_ for October 13th, 1822:\r\n\r\n\"Many hundred dead bodies will be dragged from their wooden coffins this\r\nwinter, for the anatomical lectures (which have just commenced), the\r\narticulators, and for those who deal in the dead for the supply of the\r\ncountry practitioner and the Scotch schools. The question of the right to\r\ninter in iron is now decided. Lord Chief Justice Abbott declared he wished\r\nthey might be generally used; Justice Bailey declared that if the\r\nEcclesiastical Court was to grant a suit for a fee, they, the Court of\r\nKing's Bench, would grant a prohibition, knowing it had no such right. Sir\r\nWilliam Scott, now Lord Stowell, decided and directed the interment\r\nwithout any extra fee, as this question was raised by an undertaker; those\r\nundertakers who have IRON COFFINS must divide the profits of the funeral\r\nwith EDWARD LILLIE BRIDGMAN. TEN GUINEAS reward will be paid on the\r\nconviction of any Parish Officer demanding an extra fee, whereby I shall\r\nlose the sale of a coffin. The violation of the sanctity of the grave is\r\nsaid to be needful, for the instruction of the medical pupil, but let each\r\none about to inter a mother, husband, child, or friend, say shall I devote\r\nthis object of my affection to such a purpose; if not, the only safe\r\ncoffin is Bridgman's PATENT WROUGHT-IRON ONE, charged the same price as a\r\nwooden one, and is a superior substitute for lead. Edward Lillie Bridgman,\r\n34, Fish Street Hill, and Goswell Street Road, performs funerals in any\r\npart of the kingdom, and by attention to moderate charges insures the\r\nrecommendation of those who employ him. Twenty-five private grounds within\r\nthe Bills of Mortality receive them; dues from seven shillings to one\r\nguinea. Patent cast-iron tombs and tablets, superior to stone.\"\r\n\r\nThe advertisement is headed by a rough cut, showing the coffin[16] and the\r\niron clamps by which it was fastened. There was another maker of patent\r\ncoffins, who is mentioned by Southey in his ballad called _The Surgeon's\r\nWarning_. The ballad represents the fear of a dying surgeon, lest his\r\napprentices should serve him after death as he, during his life, has\r\nserved many other persons:\r\n\r\n  \"And my 'prentices will surely come\r\n      And carve me bone from bone,\r\n  And I, who have rifled the dead man's grave,\r\n      Shall never rest in my own.\r\n\r\n  \"Bury me in lead when I am dead,\r\n      My brethren, I entreat,\r\n  And see the coffin weigh'd I beg,\r\n      Lest the plumber should be a cheat.\r\n\r\n  \"And let it be solder'd closely down\r\n      Strong as strong can be, I implore,\r\n  And put it in a patent coffin\r\n      That I may rise no more.\r\n\r\n  \"If they carry me off in the patent coffin\r\n      Their labour will be in vain,\r\n  Let the undertaker see it bought of the maker,\r\n      Who lives in St. Martin's Lane.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the surgeon's wishes were duly carried out as regards his coffin;\r\nmoney was also given to watchers to keep guard every night over the grave.\r\nThe \"'prentices,\" however, were able easily to buy the watchers, and so\r\n\r\n  \"They burst the patent coffin first,\r\n      And then cut through the lead,\r\n  And they laugh'd aloud when they saw the shroud,\r\n      Because they had got at the dead.\r\n\r\n  \"And they allow'd the sexton the shroud\r\n      And they put the coffin back,\r\n  And nose and knees they then did squeeze,\r\n      The surgeon in a sack.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"So they carried the sack pick-a-back,\r\n      And they carved him bone from bone,\r\n  But what became of the surgeon's soul,\r\n      Was never to mortal known.\"\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a Scotch paper shows the alarm felt for the\r\nsafety of the newly-buried:\r\n\r\n\"RESURRECTION-MEN.--Curiosity drew together a crowd of people on Monday,\r\nat Dundee, to witness the funeral of a child, which was consigned to the\r\ngrave in a novel manner. The father, in terror of the resurrection-men,\r\nhad caused a small box, inclosing some deathful apparatus, communicating\r\nby means of wires, with the four corners, to be fastened on the top of\r\nthe coffin. Immediately before it was lowered into the earth, a large\r\nquantity of gunpowder was poured into the box, and the hidden machinery\r\nput into a state of readiness for execution. The common opinion was, that\r\nif any one attempted to raise the body he would be blown up. The sexton\r\nseemed to dread an immediate explosion, for he started back in alarm after\r\nthrowing in the first shovelful of earth.\"\r\n\r\nFriends and relatives often placed objects on the newly-made grave, such\r\nas a flower or an oyster-shell, so that they might be able to tell if the\r\nearth had been disturbed. These objects were generally carefully noted by\r\nthe resurrection-men, and were put back in their exact places after the\r\nbody had been removed and the grave re-filled.\r\n\r\nIn some burial-grounds, houses were built in which the bodies could be\r\nkept until they were putrid, and therefore useless to the\r\nresurrection-men. Such a house is still standing in the burial-ground at\r\nCrail.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE AT CRAIL (Described on page 80). Over the door is\r\nthe following inscription: \"Erected for securing the Dead. Ann. Dom.\r\nMDCCCXXVI.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE AT CRAIL (Described on page 80). Over the door is\r\nthe following inscription: \"Erected for securing the Dead. Ann. Dom.\r\nMDCCCXXVI.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the resurrection-men were able not only to supply the\r\nLondon schools from the grave-yards in and around the Metropolis, but also\r\nto send bodies to some of the provincial schools; the Diary shows that\r\neven Edinburgh received some of the proceeds of the work of this London\r\ngang. If, however, from increased vigilance or other causes, the supply of\r\nbodies ran short in London, recourse was had to the provinces. A case\r\noccurred some seventy years ago at Yarmouth. A man died, and was buried in\r\nSt. Nicholas Churchyard. Not long after, his wife died also. On the\r\nhusband's grave being opened, it was discovered that the man's body had\r\nbeen removed; this led to a panic amongst people in Yarmouth who had\r\nrecently buried friends in that churchyard. Many graves were opened, and,\r\nin a large number of instances, were found to have been violated. This led\r\nto a regular watch being established over newly-made graves in the\r\nchurchyard. It was the custom of the resurrection-men, when they had\r\nbodies to send from the country to London, to forward them so that they\r\nshould, in outward appearance, correspond with the class of goods exported\r\nfrom the place where the bodies had been obtained. If the goods usually\r\ncame to London in crates, crates were used by the body-snatchers; if\r\nordinary packing-cases, then the bodies were enclosed in like receptacles.\r\nThe proceeds of the exhumations at Yarmouth were probably packed in\r\nbarrels, and came through Billingsgate.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 three casks, labelled \"Bitter Salts,\" were taken down to George's\r\nDock at Liverpool, to be shipped on board the _Latona_, bound for Leith; a\r\nfull description of this transaction was printed as a broadside, of which\r\nthe following is a copy:\r\n\r\n\"RESURRECTIONISTS AT LIVERPOOL.\r\n\r\n\"Discovery of 33 Human Bodies, in Casks, about to be shipped from\r\nLiverpool for Edinburgh, on Monday last, October 9, 1826.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday afternoon, a carter took down one of our quays three casks, to\r\nbe shipped on board the Carron Company's vessel, the _Latona_, addressed\r\nto 'Mr. G. Ironson, Edinburgh.' The casks remained on the quay all night,\r\nand this morning, previous to their being put on board, a horrible stench\r\nwas experienced by the mate of the _Latona_ and other persons, whose duty\r\nit was to ship them. This caused some suspicion that their contents did\r\nnot agree with their superscription, which was 'Bitter Salts,' and which\r\nthe shipping note described they contained. The mate communicated his\r\nsuspicions to the agent of the Carron Company, and that gentleman very\r\npromptly communicated the circumstances to the police. Socket, a\r\nconstable, was sent to the Quay, and he caused the casks to be opened,\r\nwhen Eleven Dead Bodies were found therein, salted and pickled. The casks\r\nwere detained, and George Leech, the cart-man, readily went with the\r\nofficer to the cellar whence he carted them, which was situated under the\r\nschool of Dr. McGowan, at the back of his house in Hope Street; the cellar\r\nwas padlocked, but, by the aid of a crow-bar, Boughey, a police officer,\r\nsucceeded in forcing an entrance, and, on searching therein, he found 4\r\ncasks, all containing human bodies, salted as the others were, and three\r\nsacks, each containing a dead body. He also found a syringe, of that\r\ndescription used for injecting hot wax into the veins and arteries of the\r\ndead bodies used for anatomization; he also found a variety of\r\nsmock-frocks, jackets, and trowsers, which, no doubt, were generally used\r\nby the Resurrectionists to disguise themselves. In this cellar were found\r\ntwenty-two dead bodies, pickled and fresh, and in the casks on the quay,\r\neleven, making in the whole thirty-three. The carter described the persons\r\nwho employed him as of very respectable appearance, but he did not know\r\nthe names of any of them.\r\n\r\n\"Information of the above circumstances was speedily communicated to his\r\nWorship, the Mayor, who sent for Dr. McGowan. This gentleman is a reverend\r\ndivine, and teacher of languages; he attended the Mayor immediately, and,\r\nin answer to the questions put to him, we understand he said, that he let\r\nhis cellar in January last to a person named Henderson, who, he\r\nunderstood, carried on the oil trade, and that he knew nothing about any\r\ndead bodies being there. George Leech deposed that he plies for hire as a\r\ncarter (the cart belongs to his brother); yesterday afternoon, between\r\nthree and four o'clock, a tall, stout man asked him the charge of carting\r\nthree casks from Hope Street to George's Dock passage; he replied, 2s.\r\nThey then went to Hope Street, where the witness found two other men\r\ngetting the first cask out of a cellar under Dr. McGowan's schoolroom, and\r\nwitness assisted to get two other casks out of the cellar; the three were\r\nthen put into his cart, and the men who employed him gave him a shipping\r\nnote, describing the casks as containing 'Bitter Salts,' and told him to\r\nbe careful in laying them down upon the quay, and that they were to be\r\nforwarded to Edinburgh by the _Latona_.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Thomas Wm. Dawes, surgeon, of St. Paul's Square, deposed that he had\r\nexamined the bodies, by the direction of the Coroner. In one cask he had\r\nfound the bodies of two women and one man; in another, two women and two\r\nmen; in the third, three men and one woman, and in the other casks and\r\nsacks he found 22 (_sic_) bodies, viz., nine men, five boys, and three\r\ngirls; the bodies were all in a perfect state; those in the casks appeared\r\nto have been dead six or seven days, and three men found in the sacks\r\nappeared to have been dead only three or four days. In each of the casks\r\nwas a large quantity of salt. There were no external marks of violence,\r\nbut there was a thread tied round the toes of one of the women, which is\r\nusual for some families to do immediately after death. Witness had no\r\nreason but to believe that they had died in a natural way, and he had no\r\ndoubt the bodies had all been disinterred. The Season for Lectures on\r\nAnatomy is about to commence in the capital of Scotland.\r\n\r\n\"The police were ordered to be upon the alert to discover the persons who\r\nhad been engaged in this transaction, but as yet nothing further has been\r\nascertained. The bodies, by the direction of the Coroner, were buried this\r\nmorning in the parish cemetery, in casks, as they were found.\r\n\r\n\"It is not yet ascertained whence these bodies have been brought, but it\r\nis supposed that the Liverpool Workhouse Cemetery has been the principal\r\nsufferer. Some of them are so putrid, that it is extremely dangerous to\r\nhandle them.\r\n\r\nBOAG, PRINTER.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe statements in this broadside are quite true, and agree with the\r\naccount which is to be found in the _Liverpool Mercury_ for October 13th,\r\n1826. Henderson, who was a Greenock man, and the principal in this\r\nbusiness, escaped, and could not be brought to justice; but a man named\r\nJames Donaldson, who was a party to the transaction, was made to pay a\r\nfine of £50, and was sent to Kirkdale Gaol for twelve months.\r\n\r\nFrom Ireland very many bodies were exported, chiefly to Edinburgh; a\r\nbetter price could be obtained there than in Dublin, and the consequence\r\nwas that the Irish schools were often very badly supplied with subjects.\r\nIn Dublin there were several ancient burial-grounds, all badly protected;\r\nthe poor were all buried in one part, and, as their friends were generally\r\nunable to afford watchers, their bodies fell an easy prey to the\r\nresurrection-men. In January, 1828, the detection of a body about to be\r\nexported caused a tumult in the streets of Dublin, and led to the murder\r\nof a man named Luke Redmond, a porter at the College of Surgeons.[18] The\r\nbody-snatchers in Dublin seem to have done more damage than the men\r\nengaged in a like occupation in London; they were not content with taking\r\nthe bodies, but, in addition, they broke the tomb-stones, and played\r\ngeneral havoc in the grave-yards.\r\n\r\nAccording to the following cutting from the _Universal Spectator and\r\nWeekly Journal_, May 20th, 1732 (printed in _Notes and Queries_, 5th ser.\r\ni. 65), bodies were sometimes taken for other than dissection purposes.\r\n\"John Loftas, the Grave Digger, committed to prison for robbing of dead\r\ncorpse, has confess'd to the plunder of above fifty, not only of their\r\ncoffins and burial cloaths, but of their fat, where bodies afforded any,\r\nwhich he retail'd at a high price to certain people, who, it is believed,\r\nwill be call'd upon on account thereof. Since this discovery several\r\npersons have had their friends dug up, who were found quite naked, and\r\nsome mangled in so horrible a manner as could scarcely be suppos'd to be\r\ndone by a human creature.\"\r\n\r\nSouthey also refers to this in the poem before quoted, where he makes the\r\nsurgeon say in his lamentation,\r\n\r\n     \"I have made candles of infants' fat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well-nigh impossible to read of all these misdoings and not to ask\r\nwhy the Government did not step in and put a stop to them? It was urged by\r\nmany that a short Act should be passed, making the violation of a grave a\r\npenal offence, as it was in France. There was a general agreement that\r\nanatomical education was absolutely necessary for medical men, and that\r\nthis education was an impossibility without a supply of subjects; yet\r\nthere was a great reluctance to interfere by legislation. The Home\r\nSecretary told a deputation that there was no difficulty in drawing up an\r\neffective Bill; the great obstacle was the prejudice of the people against\r\nany Bill; this impediment, he added, had not been trifling.\r\n\r\nBy no class of men was legislation more earnestly asked for than by the\r\nteachers of anatomy; to them the system then in vogue was not only\r\ndegrading, but it meant absolute ruin.\r\n\r\nThere was at that time no property in a dead body, and a prosecution for\r\nfelony could not take place unless some portion of the grave-clothes or\r\ncoffin could be proved to have been stolen with the body. The\r\nresurrection-men were well aware of this fact, and generally took\r\nprecaution to keep themselves out of the meshes of the law.\r\n\r\nThere had been some successful prosecutions like that of Holmes and\r\nWilliams before mentioned, but magistrates would not always convict.\r\n\r\nIn 1788 this question first came before the Court of King's Bench in the\r\ncase of Rex _v._ Lynn. The indictment charged the prisoner with entering a\r\ncertain burial-ground, and taking a coffin out of the earth, and removing\r\na body, which he had taken from the coffin, and carrying it away, for the\r\npurpose of dissecting it. For the defence the following passage from Lord\r\nCoke was quoted: \"It is to be observed that in every sepulchre that hath a\r\nmonument two things are to be considered, viz., the monument, and the\r\nsepulture or burial of the dead: the burial of the cadaver is _nullius in\r\nbonis_, and belongs to Ecclesiastical cognizance; but as to the monument,\r\naction is given at the common law for defacing thereof.\" The only Act of\r\nParliament which was said to bear on the subject was that of 1 Jac. I., c.\r\n12, which made it felony to steal bodies for purposes of witchcraft. The\r\nCourt, however, held in this case of Rex _v._ Lynn that to take a body\r\nfrom a burial-ground was an offence at common law, and _contra bonos\r\nmores_. In the judgment it was stated that as the defendant might have\r\ncommitted the crime through ignorance, no person having been before\r\npunished for this offence, the Court only fined him five marks. The\r\nreference here, to no one having been previously punished for a like\r\noffence, refers only to the Superior Courts, as there had been convictions\r\nat the Police Courts and the Old Bailey. Despite this decision of the\r\nCourt, prosecutions were very seldom undertaken, although Southwood\r\nSmith[19] states that there had been fourteen convictions in England\r\nduring the year 1823. In examination before the Committee on Anatomy, in\r\n1828, Mr. Twyford, one of the magistrates at Worship Street Police Court,\r\nstated that he had not had more than six cases in as many years.\r\n\r\nThe following account of proceedings at Hatton Garden Police Court, in\r\n1814, will show the difficulty of getting a conviction. In this case there\r\nseems to have been no one to identify the bodies. It is very improbable\r\nthat in a case of this sort the authorities of burial-grounds would come\r\nforward to give evidence, and so confess their own negligence.\r\n\r\n\"HATTON GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\"T. Light, W. Arnot, and ---- Spelling, were brought up on Wednesday. It\r\nappeared that the prisoners were going up Holborn about half-past four\r\no'clock on Tuesday afternoon, with a horse and cart; they were observed by\r\ntwo officers, who, knowing the prisoners to be resurrection-men, stopped\r\nthe horse and cart, and, after a hard contest, succeeded in securing the\r\nprisoners. They then examined the contents of the cart, and found it\r\ncontained seven dead bodies of men and women; one of the bodies was\r\nheadless, but how it came to be so remains as yet to be cleared up. They\r\nwere packed up in bags and baskets. The prisoners were followed by an\r\nimmense crowd to Hatton Garden Office, whence they were committed to\r\nprison, and the bodies deposited in the lock-up house. The cart was hired\r\nat Battle Bridge. Some of the officers were sent to make enquiry at the\r\ndifferent burying-grounds. The Office was crowded with men and women, who\r\nhad some of their relatives buried on Sunday last, to see if they could\r\nrecognize any of the bodies. They were brought up again on Thursday, and\r\ndischarged.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1822 the case of Rex _v._ Cundick was tried at Kingston Assizes,\r\n_coram_ Graham.[20] This was an indictment for misdemeanour. A man named\r\nEdward Lee was executed in the parish of St. Mary, Newington; George\r\nCundick was employed by the keeper of the gaol to bury the body of Lee,\r\nand for this he was paid. Instead of burying the corpse, he sold it for\r\ndissection, or, in the words of the indictment, he \"for the sake of wicked\r\nlucre and gain did take and carry away the said body, and did sell and\r\ndispose of the same for the purpose of being dissected, cut in pieces,\r\nmangled, and destroyed, to the great scandal and disgrace of religion,\r\ndecency, and morality, in contempt of our Lord the King, and his laws, to\r\nthe evil example of all other persons in like cases offending.\" The\r\nevidence showed plainly that Cundick had had possession of the body, and\r\nthat he had received the burial fees. On the friends of Lee wishing to see\r\nthe corpse, Cundick declared that it was already buried; but several days\r\nafter this he clandestinely went through the ceremony of burying a coffin\r\nfilled with rubbish. It was also proved that Cundick had been seen to\r\nremove a heavy package from his house at night, and that the body of Lee\r\nhad been identified in a dissecting-room. The defence was, in the first\r\nplace, that the indictment was bad \"as a perfect anomaly in the history of\r\ncriminal pleading.\" In the second place, if the indictment were good, it\r\nwas unsupported by evidence. It was argued by counsel that the only\r\nevidence before the Court was that the body was not buried, and that it\r\nwas found at a dissecting-room. Without the production of the owner of the\r\ndissecting-room, and the proof that he had bought the body from Cundick,\r\nthe jury could not be asked to give a verdict against the defendant. The\r\nJudge, however, over-ruled these objections, and the jury found the\r\nprisoner guilty.\r\n\r\nThese trials and verdicts made it still more difficult than before to get\r\nsubjects for dissection, as even men of the Resurrectionist class\r\nhesitated to run the risk of getting the punishment, which now the\r\nsuperior Courts had upheld. Those who did run this risk very naturally\r\nexpected a price proportionate to the danger, and so the cost of subjects\r\nwas still more increased.\r\n\r\nBut to surgeons, and to teachers of anatomy, by far the most important\r\ntrial of all was that of John Davies and others, of Warrington, for\r\nobtaining the body of Jane Fairclough, which had been taken from the\r\nchapel-yard belonging to the Baptists, at High Cliff, Appleton, Cheshire,\r\nin October, 1827. This case was tried at Lancaster Assizes, March 14th,\r\n1828. The defendants were John Davies (a medical student at the Warrington\r\nDispensary), Edward Hall (a surgeon and apothecary in practice at\r\nWarrington), William Blundell (an apprentice to a stationer in the same\r\ntown), and Richard Box. Thomas Ashton was also included in the indictment,\r\nbut no evidence was offered against him. There were fourteen counts in the\r\nindictment, ten charging the defendants with conspiracy, and four charging\r\nthem with unlawfully procuring and receiving the body of Jane Fairclough.\r\nIt appears, from the report of the trial, that Davies called on Dr. Moss,\r\none of the Physicians to the Dispensary, and obtained permission to use a\r\nbuilding in his garden for the purpose of dissecting a subject which he\r\nhad purchased. Mr. Hall, on behalf of Davies, paid four guineas to the men\r\nwho brought the body to a cellar in Warrington, but he knew nothing more\r\nof the transaction; from the cellar the body was removed to Dr. Moss'\r\npremises by Blundell and another man, and was received by Davies and a\r\nservant of Dr. Moss. Information of the exhumation seems to have quickly\r\ngot about. The funeral was on a Friday; on the Monday following the grave\r\nwas undisturbed, but on Tuesday the soil was spread about, and an\r\nexamination of the grave showed that the corpse had been removed. The\r\nbody was identified at Dr. Moss' house, and was taken away before any\r\ndissection had been performed on it.\r\n\r\nIn charging the jury, Mr. Baron Hullock said that, as conspiracy was an\r\noffence of serious magnitude, they should be satisfied, before finding a\r\nverdict of guilty on the former part of the indictment, that the conduct\r\nof the defendants was the result of previous concert.... If any of the\r\ndefendants were in possession of the body under circumstances which must\r\nhave apprized them that it was improperly disinterred, the jury would find\r\nthem guilty of the latter part of the charge. The only bodies legally\r\nliable to dissection in this country were those of persons executed for\r\nmurder. However necessary it might be, for the purposes of humanity and\r\nscience, that these things should be done, yet, as long as the law\r\nremained as it was at present, the disinterment of bodies for dissection\r\nwas an offence liable to punishment. The jury found all the defendants not\r\nguilty of the charge of conspiracy, but they pronounced Davies and\r\nBlundell guilty of possession of the body, with knowledge of the illegal\r\ndisinterment. The defendants were brought up for judgment in London in\r\nMay, 1828. Mr. Justice Bayley, in passing sentence, said that \"there were\r\ndegrees of guilt, and in this case the defendants were not the most\r\ncriminal parties.\" He sentenced Davies to a fine of £20, and Blundell to a\r\nfine of £5.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that in this trial there is no charge against anyone for\r\nviolating the grave, or stealing the body. The fines were inflicted on\r\nDavies and Blundell for having the body in their possession, knowing it to\r\nhave been disinterred. This decision, therefore, as before stated, was of\r\nthe utmost importance to teachers of anatomy, as they were clearly liable\r\nto punishment for all the subjects supplied to them by the\r\nResurrectionists. The teachers knew well the sources from which the bodies\r\nwere obtained, and were only driven to get them in the way they did\r\nthrough there being no regular supply of subjects from a legitimate\r\nsource. The feeling that legislation on this subject was absolutely\r\nnecessary, was more keenly felt than ever, and the teachers did all they\r\ncould to get a change in the laws. Many pamphlets were issued from the\r\npress, urging this duty upon Parliament; it was pointed out that if a\r\nsupply of bodies could be regularly obtained in a legal way, the trade of\r\nthe Resurrectionist would at once cease. There were many who doubted this,\r\nbut subsequent events proved the statement to be strictly accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Surgical Operations, or a New method of Obtaining\r\nSubjects._]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very strongly urged that the Act of Geo. II., which ordered the\r\nbodies of all murderers executed in London and Middlesex to be anatomized\r\nby the Surgeons' Company, ought to be repealed. No doubt this provision\r\nmuch increased the dislike of the poor to any regulations by which the\r\nbodies of their friends might be given up for dissection after death. It\r\nwas felt that dissection by the Surgeons was part of the sentence passed\r\non a murderer, and therefore carried with it shame and disgrace. To make\r\nprovision by law, therefore, for the dissection of the bodies of any other\r\nclass of persons was, not unnaturally, distasteful, in that it partly put\r\nthem in the same position as murderers.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the desire for the repeal of this obnoxious clause was that\r\nnothing must be done to weaken the law; it was stated that to withdraw the\r\npart of the sentence which related to dissection would rob the punishment\r\nof its prohibitive effect. It is somewhat difficult to understand the\r\nargument; surely if the risk of suffering the extreme penalty of the law\r\nwould not keep a man from crime, the extra chance of being dissected after\r\ndeath could hardly be expected to do so. As Sir Henry Halford said, \"I\r\ncertainly think that while that law remains they [the public] will connect\r\nthe crime of murder with the practice of dissection; an order to be\r\ndissected, and a permission to be dissected, seem to be too slight a\r\ndistinction.\"\r\n\r\nAnother objection to the dissection of murderers came from the teachers.\r\nThey stated that when the body of a notorious criminal was lying at either\r\nof the Anatomical Schools, the proprietor was pestered by persons of a\r\nmorbid turn of mind for permission to view the body. This difficulty was\r\nalso felt by the College of Surgeons, and in consequence a placard was\r\nhung up outside the place where the dissections were made, giving notice\r\nthat no person could be admitted, unless accompanied by a member of the\r\nCourt of Assistants.\r\n\r\nTo make dissection less distasteful to the general public, and to show the\r\nadvantages of anatomy, some endeavours were made to explain the structure\r\nof the human body to non-professional persons. In Ireland Sir Philip\r\nCrampton lectured with open doors, and gave demonstrations in anatomy to\r\npoor people. These persons, he tells us, became interested in the subject,\r\nand often brought him bodies for dissection. A newspaper cutting of 1829\r\nshows that this was also tried in London. A surgeon called in the\r\noverseers and churchwardens of St. Clement Danes, and gave a demonstration\r\non a body, explaining its construction, and the use of the internal\r\norgans. \"By this means,\" says the paragraph, \"he so fully absorbed the\r\nself-interest of his audience as to extinguish the pre-conceived notions\r\nof horror and disgust attached to the idea of a spectacle of this\r\ndescription. The enlightened governors of the parish assented to the _post\r\nmortem_ examination of the body of every unclaimed pauper, an enquiry into\r\nwhose case might appear conducive to the interests of medical science.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been already pointed out that, to try to overcome the repugnance to\r\ndissection, some persons left specific instructions that their bodies\r\nshould be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe representations of the teachers were so far successful, that in 1828 a\r\nSelect Committee was appointed by the House of Commons \"to enquire into\r\nthe manner of obtaining subjects for dissection in the Schools of Anatomy,\r\nand into the state of the law affecting the persons employed in obtaining\r\nand dissecting bodies.\" Amongst those who gave evidence before the\r\nCommittee were the principal teachers of anatomy, and three of the\r\nresurrection-men. The tone of the Report was decidedly in sympathy with\r\nthe teachers, but it strongly condemned the way in which they were\r\ncompelled to obtain bodies for dissection. After showing how badly off\r\nEnglish students were for opportunities of learning anatomy, as compared\r\nwith those of foreign countries, and pointing out that those students who\r\nreally wished to master their art were compelled to go abroad, the Report\r\nproceeds: \"These disadvantages affecting the teachers are such, that\r\nexcept in the most frequented schools, attached to the greater hospitals,\r\nfew have been able to continue teaching with profit, and some private\r\nteachers have been compelled to give up their schools. To the evils\r\nenumerated it may be added, that it is distressing to men of good\r\neducation and character to be compelled to resort, for their means of\r\nteaching, to a constant infraction of the laws of their country, and to be\r\nmade dependent, for their professional existence, on the mercenary\r\ncaprices of the most abandoned class in the community.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1829, Mr. Warburton obtained leave to introduce into the House\r\nof Commons \"A Bill for preventing the unlawful disinterment of human\r\nbodies, and for regulating Schools of Anatomy.\" In this Bill it was\r\nenacted that persons found guilty of disinterring any human body from any\r\nchurchyard, burial-ground or vault, or assisting at any such disinterment,\r\nshould be imprisoned for a term not exceeding six months for the first\r\noffence, and two years for the second offence. Seven Commissioners were to\r\nbe appointed; the majority of these were not to be either physicians,\r\nsurgeons, or apothecaries. All unclaimed bodies of persons dying in\r\nworkhouses or hospitals, were, seventy-two hours after death, to be given\r\nover for purposes of dissection; but if within this specified time a\r\nrelative appeared and requested that the body might not be used for\r\nanatomical purposes, such request was to be granted. Another proposed\r\nchange in the law was that a person might legally bequeath his body for\r\ndissection; in such cases the executors, administrators, or next-of-kin\r\nhad the option of carrying out the wishes of the testator, or declining to\r\ndo so, as they thought fit. A heavy penalty was laid on persons who were\r\nfound carrying on human anatomy in an unlicensed building, and it was made\r\nan offence to move a body from one place to another, without a licence for\r\nso doing. All bodies used for dissection were to be buried; the penalty\r\nfor failing to do this was fifty pounds.\r\n\r\nOne great blot on this Bill was the neglecting to repeal the clause which\r\nordered the bodies of murderers to be given up for dissection. As pointed\r\nout on page 87, this was one of the great reasons which made dissection so\r\nhateful to the poor. During the debate, a motion was made by Sir R. Inglis\r\n\"to repeal so much of the Act 9 Geo. IV. cap. 31, as empowers judges to\r\norder the bodies of murderers to be given over for dissection.\" This,\r\nhowever, was lost, eight members only voting for the amendment, and forty\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\nThere was strong opposition to the Bill outside the House. Some of the\r\nprivate teachers were very uneasy as regarded the effect of the Bill on\r\nthemselves. The measure spoke of \"recognized teachers\" and \"hospital\r\nschools,\" and all those who were to be entitled to the benefits of the Act\r\nwere to have licences from one of the Medical Corporations. The\r\nproprietors of the smaller schools felt that this would result in their\r\nextinction, and that the teaching would all pass to the large schools. In\r\nthe country, too, there was strong opposition to the Bill, as\r\npractitioners there felt that they were excluded from any benefit. The\r\n_Lancet_, always ready in those days with a nickname, dubbed the measure\r\n\"A Bill for Preventing Country Surgeons from Studying Anatomy.\" The\r\nCollege of Surgeons also petitioned against the Bill. The Council felt\r\nthat the appointment of Commissioners, who were to have complete control\r\nover all schools and places of dissection, would greatly interfere with\r\nthe privileges of the College. It was pointed out to the House of Commons\r\nthat the establishment of a Board, such as that proposed by the Bill, was\r\nvirtually placing the whole profession of surgery under the control of\r\nCommissioners, not one of whom need be a member of the profession, and the\r\nmajority of whom must not be so.\r\n\r\nAnother fault of the Bill was that it did not apply to Ireland. A large\r\nsupply of bodies was regularly sent from that country to England and\r\nScotland, and it was felt that to exclude Ireland from the provisions of\r\nthe Bill, was simply increasing the temptation for bodies to be still more\r\nlargely exported therefrom.\r\n\r\nIt was also argued that the Bill would tell hardly against the poor, as\r\nthey would refuse to go into workhouses or hospitals if they thought that\r\ntheir bodies would be dissected after death. For this objection there was\r\nno foundation, and Mr. Peel pointed out, in the debate on the third\r\nreading, that \"it was the poor who would really be benefited by the\r\nmeasure. The rich could always command good advice, whilst the poor had a\r\nstrong interest in the general extension of anatomical science.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bill passed the Commons, but was lost in the Lords.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, Lord Calthorpe was to have again introduced the Bill into the\r\nUpper House, but the intention was abandoned on account of the threatened\r\ndissolution of Parliament. As the _Lancet_ expressed it, \"Dissolution has\r\nso many horrors, that a discussion on the _subject_ at the present time\r\nwould be by no means agreeable.\"\r\n\r\nPublic feeling was now very strong in favour of some law to prevent the\r\nwholesale spoliation of graves, which was going on practically unchecked.\r\nBut, as has happened frequently in legislation, the absolute necessity for\r\na change in the law was brought within the range of practical politics by\r\na crime of a most diabolical character, one which, in this country,\r\ncreated a sensation equal to that raised in Scotland by the atrocities of\r\nBurke and Hare in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nOn November 5th, 1831, two men, named Bishop and May, called at the\r\ndissecting-room at King's College, and asked Hill, the porter, if he\r\n\"wanted anything.\" On being interrogated as to what they had to dispose\r\nof, May replied, \"A boy of fourteen.\" For this body they asked 12\r\nguineas, but ultimately agreed to bring it in for 9 guineas. They went\r\noff, and returned in the afternoon with another man named Williams,\r\n_alias_ Head, and a porter named Shields, the latter of whom carried the\r\nbody in a hamper. The appearance of the subject excited Hill's suspicion\r\nof foul play, and he at once communicated with Mr. Partridge, the\r\nDemonstrator of Anatomy. A further examination of the body by Mr.\r\nPartridge confirmed the porter's suspicions.[21] To delay the men, so that\r\nthe police might be communicated with, Mr. Partridge produced a £50 note,\r\nand said that he could not pay until he had changed it. Soon after, the\r\npolice officers appeared upon the scene, and the men were given into\r\ncustody. At the coroner's inquest a verdict of \"Wilful murder against some\r\nperson or persons unknown\" was brought in, the jury adding that there was\r\nstrong suspicion against Bishop and Williams. The prisoners were not\r\nallowed to go free, but were kept in custody. Bishop, Williams, and May\r\nwere tried at the Old Bailey, December, 1831. The evidence given against\r\nthem showed that they had tried to sell the body at Guy's Hospital; being\r\nrefused there, they tried Mr. Grainger, at his Anatomical Theatre, but\r\nwith no success. Then they tried King's, where their crime was detected.\r\nThe body was proved to be that of an Italian boy, named Carlo Ferrari, who\r\nobtained his living by showing white mice. The boy's teeth had been\r\nextracted, and it was proved that they had been sold by one of the\r\nprisoners to Mr. Mills, a dentist, for twelve shillings. The jury found\r\nall three prisoners guilty, and they were sentenced to death.\r\n\r\nFrom the subsequent confessions of Bishop and Williams, it was shown that\r\nthey had enticed the boy to their dwelling in Nova Scotia Gardens; there\r\nthey drugged him with opium, and then let his body into a well, where they\r\nkept it until he was suffocated. To the last the prisoners declared that\r\nthe deceased was not the Italian boy, but a lad from Lincolnshire. They\r\nseem to have had great difficulty in disposing of the body, as Bishop, in\r\nhis confession, said that, before taking it to Guy's, they had tried Mr.\r\nTuson and Mr. Carpue, both in vain. Bishop and Williams confessed, also,\r\nto the murder of a woman named Fanny Pigburn, and a boy, whose name was\r\nsupposed to be Cunningham. Both of these bodies they sold for dissection.\r\nMay was respited, and was sentenced to transportation for life. On hearing\r\nof his respite, May went into a fit, and for some time his life was\r\ndespaired of; he, however, partially recovered, but his feeble state of\r\nhealth was aggravated by the annoyance he received from the other convicts\r\non board the hulks. He died on board the _Grampus_ in 1832.\r\n\r\nMay can hardly be described as even a minor poet, if the following verse,\r\nwritten whilst in prison, may be taken as a fair sample of his\r\ncompositions:\r\n\r\n  \"James May is doomed to die,\r\n  And is condemned most innocently;\r\n  The God above, He knows the same,\r\n  And will send a mitigation for his pain.\"\r\n\r\nAt the execution of Bishop and Williams, there was a scene of the most\r\ntremendous excitement. By some mistake, three chains hung from the\r\ngallows; one was taken away as soon as the error was noticed, and this was\r\nrecognized by the crowd as a sign that May had been reprieved.\r\n\r\nThe _Weekly Dispatch_ sold upwards of 50,000 copies of the number which\r\ncontained the confessions of the murderers. Many persons were injured in\r\nthe crowd, and the _Dispatch_ states that those who were hurt were\r\nattended to \"by Mr. Birkett, the dresser to Mr. Vincent, who had been in\r\nattendance [at St. Bartholomew's Hospital] to receive any accident that\r\nmight be brought in.\"\r\n\r\nBishop was the son of a carrier between London and Highgate, and on the\r\ndeath of his father he succeeded to the business. This he soon sold, and\r\nbecame an informer. He got mixed up with some of the resurrection-men, and\r\nthen regularly took to the occupation. Williams, _alias_ Head, was\r\nBishop's brother-in-law, and was a well-known member of the\r\nresurrection-gang.\r\n\r\nIn the _Weekly Dispatch_ for December 11th, 1831, the following curious\r\ninformation respecting Williams appeared:\r\n\r\n\"EXCISE COURT.--YESTERDAY.\r\n\r\n\"THE KING _v._ THOMAS HEAD, _alias_ WILLIAMS, THE MURDERER.--The Court was\r\noccupied during a great part of the morning in hearing the evidence in\r\nthe case of Head, _alias_ Williams (who was hung with Bishop) for carrying\r\non an illicit trade in the manufacture of glass. It appeared that the\r\ndeceased was a _Cribb Man_, or regular porter, to private glass blowers.\r\nThere were found on the premises at No. 2, Nova Scotia Gardens (the scene\r\nof the late murders), a regular furnace, and all the necessary apparatus\r\nfor the manufacture of glass, which trade it appears was carried on to a\r\nvery considerable extent on the premises. Alexander M'Knight, an officer\r\nof Excise, deposed that on the 6th of August last, he went to No. 2, Nova\r\nScotia Gardens, and made a seizure of 68 cwt. of manufactured glass, 24\r\ncwt. of cullet, and 16 cwt. of iron, articles used in the manufacture of\r\nglass. In about half-an-hour afterwards he saw Williams come out of\r\nBishop's yard; Williams spoke to witness, and called him by an opprobrious\r\nname for having made the seizure. Judgment 'abated,' the goods to be\r\nreturned to the Excise Office to be condemned.\"\r\n\r\nMay had been brought up as a butcher, but this trade he gave up, and\r\nbecame possessed of a horse and cart with which he was supposed to ply\r\nfor hire. The real business of the vehicle, however, seems to have been to\r\nconvey bodies from place to place for the Resurrectionists. Shields, the\r\nporter to the gang, had been watchman and grave-digger at the Roman\r\nCatholic Chapel in Moorfields, so that he was most useful to the other\r\nResurrectionists in giving information, and in granting facilities for the\r\nremoval of bodies. No evidence was offered against him in connection with\r\nthe murder of the Italian boy. Soon after the trial he attempted to get\r\nwork as a porter in Covent Garden Market, but on his being recognized by\r\nthose working there, a shout of \"Burker!\" was raised, and Shields narrowly\r\nescaped with his life, and took refuge in the Police Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN HEAD, _alias_ THOMAS WILLIAMS. JOHN BISHOP. Executed\r\nDecember 5, 1831. From Drawings by W. H. CLIFT, made directly after the\r\nexecution.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis one incident as regards Shields gives an idea of the public feeling\r\ntowards the resurrection-men, and that feeling was quite as bitter towards\r\nthe anatomists. It was therefore absolutely necessary that some determined\r\nsteps should be taken as regards legislation.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1831, Mr. Warburton again introduced a Bill into the House of\r\nCommons; it passed safely through both Houses, and became law on August\r\n1st, 1832. By this new Act the Secretary of State for the Home Department\r\nin Great Britain, and the Chief Secretary in Ireland, were empowered to\r\ngrant licences for anatomical purposes to any person lawfully qualified to\r\npractise medicine, to any professor or teacher of anatomy, and to students\r\nattending any school of medicine, on an application signed by two justices\r\nof the peace, who could certify that the applicant intended to carry on\r\nthe practice of anatomy. It was enacted that executors, or other persons\r\nhaving lawful possession of a body (provided they were not undertakers, or\r\npersons to whom the body had been handed over for purposes of interment),\r\nmight give it up for dissection unless the deceased had expressed a wish\r\nduring his life that his body should not be so used, or unless a known\r\nrelative objected to the body being given up. If a person had expressed a\r\nwish to be dissected, this wish was to be carried out unless the relatives\r\nraised any objection. No body might be moved for anatomical purposes until\r\nforty-eight hours after death, nor until the expiration of a twenty-four\r\nhours' notice to the Inspector of Anatomy; a proper death certificate had\r\nalso to be signed by the medical attendant before the body could be moved.\r\nProvision was made for the decent removal of all bodies, and for their\r\nburial in consecrated ground, or in some public burial-ground in use for\r\npersons of that religious persuasion to which the person, whose body was\r\nso removed, belonged. A certificate of the interment was to be sent to the\r\nInspector within six weeks after the day on which the body was received.\r\nNo licensed person was to be liable to any prosecution, penalty,\r\nforfeiture, or punishment for having a body in his possession for\r\nanatomical purposes according to the provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important clause was that which did away with the\r\ndissection of the bodies of murderers. This was done by Section XVI.,\r\nwhich ran as follows:\r\n\r\n\"And whereas an Act was passed in the Ninth Year of the Reign of His late\r\nMajesty, for consolidating and amending the Statutes in England relative\r\nto Offences against the Person, by which latter Act it is enacted, that\r\nthe Body of every Person convicted of Murder shall, after Execution,\r\neither be dissected or hung in Chains, as to the Court which tried the\r\nOffender shall deem meet; and that the Sentence to be pronounced by the\r\nCourt shall express that the Body of the Offender shall be dissected or\r\nhung in Chains, whichever of the Two the Court shall order. Be it enacted,\r\nThat so much of the said last-recited Act as authorizes the Court, if it\r\nshall see fit, to direct that the Body of a Person convicted of Murder\r\nshall after Execution, be dissected, be and the same is hereby repealed:\r\nand that in every case of Conviction of any Prisoner for Murder, the Court\r\nbefore which such Prisoner shall have been tried shall direct such\r\nPrisoner either to be hung in Chains or buried within the Precincts of the\r\nPrison in which such Prisoner shall have been confined after conviction,\r\nas to such Court shall deem meet; and that the sentence to be pronounced\r\nby the Court shall express that the body of such Prisoner shall be hung in\r\nChains, or buried within the Precincts of the Prison, whichever of the two\r\nthe Court shall order.\"\r\n\r\nThree Inspectors were appointed to carry out the provisions of the Act.\r\nThe first Inspectors were Dr. J. C. Somerville, for England; Dr. Craigie,\r\nof Edinburgh, for Scotland; and Sir James Murray, of Dublin, for Ireland.\r\nThere was no provision for punishing persons found violating graves; it\r\nhad been already decided that this was an offence at common law; and\r\npresumably the framers of the Act had, at last, sufficient faith in their\r\nmeasure to believe that it would put an end to the proceedings of the\r\nresurrection-men. If that were so, they were not disappointed. After the\r\npassing of the Act the resurrection-man, as such, drops out of history;\r\nhis occupation was gone, and one of the most nefarious trades that the\r\nworld has ever seen came completely to an end. Public feeling against\r\nthese men did not all at once subside; this strongly militated against\r\ntheir getting employment, and some of them moved to other quarters, where\r\nthey lived under assumed names.\r\n\r\nIn looking back it is impossible not to regret that Parliament was so slow\r\nto believe that legislation in the direction of the Anatomy Act would do\r\naway with the evils of the resurrection-men. This fact was urged upon them\r\nby the teachers; but popular feeling was so dead against the anatomists,\r\nwho were thought to be responsible for even the worst crimes of the\r\nresurrection-men, that Parliament seemed to fear to do anything which\r\nfavoured the teachers, although the great disadvantages under which they\r\nsuffered were thoroughly well known. Perhaps the best tribute to the\r\nsuccess of the Act, is the very small alterations which have been made in\r\nit between 1832 and the present day.\r\n\r\nA glance at the regulations in force in foreign countries for the supply\r\nof bodies, at the time of the passing of the Anatomy Act, shows that when\r\na fair provision was made by law for the supply of bodies, the\r\nresurrection-men were unknown. The great advantages of the student on the\r\nContinent, as compared with his brethren in England, were thus pointed out\r\nto the Committee by Mr. [afterwards Sir] William Lawrence: \"I see many\r\nmedical persons from France, Germany, and Italy, and have found, from my\r\nintercourse with them, that anatomy is much more successfully cultivated\r\nin those countries than in England; at the same time I know, from their\r\nnumerous valuable publications on anatomy, that they are far before us in\r\nthis science; we have no original standard works at all worthy of the\r\npresent state of knowledge.\" It was also shown that this fact was chiefly\r\nthe result of the greater opportunities for getting subjects abroad, and\r\nthat teachers found that those English students who had been to foreign\r\nschools were the best informed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution in France the hospitals of Paris were supported by\r\nvoluntary contributions, and each had separate funds and Boards of\r\nManagement, similar to the hospitals in London at the present day. At the\r\nRevolution these Boards were consolidated, and one administrative body was\r\nformed. This \"Administration des Hôpitaux, Hospices et Secours à Domicile\r\nde Paris,\" carried into effect the law passed by the Legislative Assembly,\r\nthat the bodies of all those persons who died in hospitals, which were\r\nunclaimed within twenty-four hours after death, should be given up for\r\nanatomical purposes. The distribution from the hospitals to the medical\r\nschools was systematically carried out, generally at night. By Art. 360\r\nof the Penal Code, the punishment for violation of a place of sepulture\r\nwas imprisonment for a term varying from three months to a year, and a\r\nfine of from 60 to 200 francs. The result of these regulations was that\r\nexhumation for anatomical purposes was quite unknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Germany the bodies of persons who died in prisons, or penitentiaries,\r\nand those of suicides, were given up for dissection, unless the friends of\r\nthe deceased cared to pay a certain sum to the funds of the school; in\r\nthis case the body was handed over to the friends. Other sources of supply\r\nwere the bodies of those persons who died without leaving sufficient to\r\npay the cost of burial, poor people who had been supported at the public\r\ncost, all persons executed, and public women. Although these regulations\r\nwere not rigorously carried out, there was an ample supply of bodies for\r\nanatomical purposes, and the resurrection-men were unknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Austria, if the medical attendant thought necessary, a _post mortem_\r\nwas made on all patients who died in hospital, but only unclaimed bodies\r\nwere used for dissection; these were given up to the teachers forty-eight\r\nhours after death. In Vienna the supply came from the General Hospital;\r\nthis was sufficient for all purposes, and there was no recourse to\r\nexhumation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe supply in Italy came from a source similar to that of the other\r\ncountries named. The rule was that all bodies of persons who died in\r\nhospital were given up for dissection if required; but, by paying the cost\r\nof the funeral, friends could, if they wished, take away the body. This,\r\nhowever, was seldom done. There was generally a sufficient supply of\r\nbodies; but, if this ran short, the subjects were obtained from \"the\r\ndeposit\" of poor people who died and were buried at the public cost. In\r\nevery parish church in Italy there was a chamber in which all the dead\r\nbodies of the poor were deposited during the day-time, after the religious\r\nceremonies had been performed over them in the church; at night these\r\nbodies were removed either to the dissecting-room or to the burial-fields,\r\noutside the town. Body-snatching was quite unknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an ample supply of bodies in Portugal from similar sources.\r\nMortality was very high amongst infants, who were put into _roda_, or\r\nfoundling cradles; the bodies of these children could be obtained without\r\nany difficulty. In Portugal the resurrection-man did not exist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Holland there was no lack of material for teaching anatomy, and for\r\nstudents to learn operative surgery on the dead body. The Dissecting\r\nSchool at Leyden was supplied from the civil hospitals at Amsterdam. There\r\nwas no prejudice against dissection in Holland; in all the principal towns\r\nlectures on anatomy were publicly given, and dissected subjects were\r\nexhibited. Here, again, exhumation was not necessary, and was unknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the United States the laws relating to anatomy varied very considerably\r\nin the different States; there was no regular supply for the schools, and,\r\nconsequently, subjects had to be obtained by the aid of resurrection-men.\r\nIn Philadelphia and Baltimore, the two great Medical Schools of the United\r\nStates in those days, the supply of bodies was obtained almost entirely\r\nfrom the \"Potter's Field,\" the burial-place of the poorest classes. This\r\nexhumation was carried on by an understanding with the authorities that\r\nthe men employed by the schools in this work should not be interfered\r\nwith. Dissection in the United States was, as in this country, looked upon\r\nwith great aversion; this was, no doubt, mainly owing to the fact that the\r\nbodies used for this purpose were obtained from the graves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diary of a Resurrectionist is written on 16 leaves, but is,\r\nunfortunately, imperfect. The first entry is November 28th, 1811, and the\r\nlast December 5th, 1812. There are no entries in May, June, and July;\r\nduring these months there would be little demand for subjects, as the\r\nsessions of the Anatomical Schools ran from October to May. Besides this,\r\nthe light nights would interfere with the work of the men. The entry under\r\nthe date February 25th refers to this: \"the moon at the full, could not\r\ngo.\" The state of the moon was of great importance to these men in their\r\nwork; the writer of the Diary has on one of the pages copied out the\r\n\"Rules for finding the moon on any given day,\" and has set out the epact\r\nfor 1812 and 1813.\r\n\r\nThere is no clue in the Diary itself as to the name of the writer, and,\r\nunfortunately, Sir Thomas Longmore[22] was quite unable to remember the\r\nname of the individual from whom he received it. Feeling was very strong\r\nagainst the men who had been engaged in the resurrection business, and\r\ntherefore, when information was required from them, every effort was made\r\nto keep their names secret. As late as 1843, when the _Life of Sir Astley\r\nCooper_ was published, the name of this man was carefully concealed,\r\nthough most of the other members of the gang were freely spoken of under\r\ntheir full names. Bransby Cooper[23] quotes a written statement made by\r\nthis man to the effect that he was in Maidstone Gaol in October, 1813.\r\nEnquiry at the gaol has, however, failed to find any mention of him; the\r\noriginal document is not forthcoming, and it is very probable that there\r\nis a mistake as regards the date. In this statement he is called Josh.\r\nN----, and Bransby Cooper speaks of him as N. There is a letter on\r\n\"Body-snatchers\" in the _Medical Times_, 1883, vol. i. p. 343, signed,\r\n\"Your Old Correspondent\"; the writer of the letter was, in all\r\nprobability, Mr. T. Madden Stone, who had been a correspondent of the\r\njournal in question from the time of its foundation. Mr. Stone had a\r\nvaluable collection of papers and autographs, and his letter is really a\r\nreprint of a paper in his possession relating to payments made to the\r\nresurrection-men. In it occurs the following passage: \"N.B., Sir Astley\r\nCooper great friend to Naples.\" Mr. Stone presented a large number of\r\npapers and letters to the Royal College of Surgeons, but this particular\r\none is not in the collection. It is curious that Bransby Cooper makes no\r\nspecial mention of Naples in his book, although he gives an account of all\r\nthe other men with whom Sir Astley had any dealings. He gives a long\r\nnotice of \"N.,\" and mentions that he wrote the Diary from which quotations\r\nare made; this is the document now under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe witness \"C. D.,\" who was examined before the Committee on Anatomy in\r\n1828, was, in all probability, Naples; he gave statistics to show the\r\nnumber of bodies obtained, and stated that the figures were taken \"from my\r\nbook.\" The letters \"C. D.\" are not given as initials; the three\r\nresurrection-men who gave evidence were distinguished as \"A. B.,\" \"C. D.,\"\r\nand \"F. G.\" The testimony was probably given on the condition that no\r\nnames were revealed, and, therefore, definite information cannot be\r\nobtained as to \"C. D.'s\" real name from the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nOn one page of the Diary is written \"Miss Naples.\" This does not prove\r\nmuch, as the names of several other females are mentioned; not, however,\r\nin any connection with the business. The entries look as though the writer\r\nhad amused himself by scribbling them down, and then crossing them out\r\nagain. \"Miss Naples\" is the only one not crossed through.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the man described as N---- by Bransby Cooper was on board\r\nthe _Excellent_ in the action off Cape St. Vincent. In the muster-book of\r\nthe _Excellent_ for 1797 Josh. Naples is down as an A.B.: he is there\r\nstated to have been born at Deptford, and to have been 21 years of age in\r\n1795. This seems conclusively to prove that Naples was the man who wrote\r\nthe Diary.\r\n\r\nThe men who composed the gang at the time the Diary was written are, in\r\nthat document, nearly always spoken of by their Christian names. Their\r\nnames are Ben [Crouch], Bill [Harnett], Jack [Harnett], Daniel,[24]\r\nButler, Tom [Light], and Holliss. This gang, whose doings are recorded in\r\nthe Diary, was the chief one in the Metropolis in the early part of the\r\npresent century. The account, therefore, of the proceedings of these men\r\ngives a good idea of the work of the body-snatchers in general. Honour\r\namongst thieves was not the motto of the resurrection-men; they seem to\r\nhave been ever ready to sell or cheat their comrades, if a favourable\r\nopportunity presented itself.\r\n\r\nFor the accompanying biographical notes of the men mentioned in the Diary\r\nthe writer is indebted chiefly to the account given of them by Bransby\r\nCooper.[25]\r\n\r\nBen Crouch, the leader of the gang, was the son of a carpenter, who worked\r\nat Guy's Hospital. He was a tall, powerful, athletic man, with coarse\r\nfeatures, marked with the small-pox, and was well known as a\r\nprize-fighter. He used to dress in very good clothes, and wore a profusion\r\nof gold rings, and had a large bunch of seals dangling at his fob. He was\r\ntried for stealing cloth from Watling Street, but was able to successfully\r\nprove an _alibi_. Bransby Cooper states that Crouch was seldom drunk, but\r\nwhen he was in that state he was most abusive and domineering; the Diary\r\nshows him in more than one of these attacks. He was sharp enough to be\r\nalways sober on settling-up nights, and so had a distinct advantage over\r\nhis comrades; by this means he generally managed to get more than his\r\nproper share of the proceeds of their horrible work. About 1817 he gave up\r\nthe resurrection business, and occupied himself chiefly in dealing in\r\nteeth; in this he was joined by Jack Harnett. They obtained licences as\r\nsutlers, so that they might be allowed as camp-followers, both in France\r\nand Spain. A large supply of teeth was thus obtained by them, their plan\r\nbeing to draw the sound teeth of as many dead men as possible on the night\r\nafter a battle. They did not limit their attention to teeth, but made\r\nlarge sums of money by stealing valuables from the persons of those who\r\nhad fallen in battle--proceedings which were even more brutal than their\r\nformer resurrectionist practices. With the money he had thus made, Crouch\r\nbuilt a large hotel at Margate, which at first looked like being a paying\r\nconcern. The nature of his former occupation, however, leaked out, and\r\nruined his business; he then parted with the property at a great\r\nsacrifice. Subsequently he became very poor, and, whilst Harnett was away\r\nin France, Crouch appropriated some of his property; for this he was\r\nsentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. After this he lived in London,\r\nin great poverty, and was ultimately found dead in the top room of a\r\npublic-house near Tower Hill. It is very probable that at one time he made\r\nmoney by lending to the medical students. In his \"Confessions of a\r\nDissecting-room Porter,\" before alluded to, Albert Smith says, \"I beg you\r\nwill look at your watches, if you have not already lent them to Uncle\r\nCrouch.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBill Harnett was a favourite with Astley Cooper and Henry Cline. With the\r\nexception of a fondness for gin, he seems to have been a more respectable\r\nman than one would have expected to find in such company. He was very\r\nobliging, and could generally be trusted to carry out his promises.\r\nBransby Cooper states that Bill Harnett and \"N.\" objected to Crouch, and\r\noften worked against him; in the Diary they will be all found working\r\ntogether, though there is recorded at least one \"row\" with Crouch. Bill\r\nHarnett was a good boxer, and fought Ben Crouch at Wimbledon; he had\r\npreviously received an injury to his jaw, and Crouch hit him a severe blow\r\non this part, which decided the fight in Crouch's favour. Harnett died in\r\nSt. Thomas' Hospital of consumption. Like Southey's \"Surgeon,\" he had a\r\ngreat horror of being dissected, and on his death-bed he obtained a\r\npromise from Mr. Joseph Henry Green that his body should not be opened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJack Harnett was a nephew of Bill; he is described as a stout, red-haired,\r\nill-looking fellow, uncouth in his address and manner of speech. Like his\r\npartner, Crouch, he seems to have been fond of display in the matter of\r\njewellery. But, unlike Crouch, he did not lose the money he had made, and\r\nat his death left nearly £6,000 to his family.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nButler was originally a porter in the dissecting-room at St. Thomas'.\r\nBransby Cooper describes him as \"a short, stout, good-tempered man, with a\r\nlaughing eye and Sancho-Panza sort of expression.\" He was a clever\r\narticulator, and dealt largely in bones and teeth. Afterwards he set up as\r\na dentist in Liverpool; but his dissolute habits were his ruin, and he was\r\nobliged to fly from his creditors. Butler was sentenced to death for\r\nrobbing the Edinburgh mail, but his execution was postponed. During this\r\ndelay he obtained the skeleton of a horse, and articulated it in the\r\nprison. The Austrian Archdukes John and Lewis were at that time in this\r\nkingdom, and, on visiting the prison in Edinburgh, were shown this\r\nskeleton; they were so pleased with the man's handiwork that they obtained\r\nhis pardon from the Prince Regent. After his release, Butler was never\r\nheard of again by any of his old comrades or employers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTom Light is not mentioned by Bransby Cooper by name; he gives an account\r\nof a resurrection-man whom he calls \"L----,\" but whether this notice\r\nrefers to Light or not cannot be definitely determined. In all\r\nprobability L---- and Light are identical; Cooper speaks of the former as\r\nbeing so unreliable that his comrades could never trust him. Tom Light\r\nseems to have had a happy knack of escaping justice; on p. 92 will be\r\nfound an account of his being acquitted, even when taken with the bodies\r\nin his possession. He does not seem to have worked regularly with Crouch's\r\ngang; at Hatton Garden Police Court he appeared as T. Light, _alias_ John\r\nJones, _alias_ Thomas Knight, in October, 1812, and it was stated against\r\nhim that he had lately been convicted at the Middlesex Sessions of\r\nstealing dead bodies for dissection, but he had evaded standing his trial,\r\nin consequence of which the Bench issued a warrant against him. The\r\nparticular charge on which he was now brought before the magistrates was\r\nthat, with Patrick Harnell,[26] one of his bail, he had been found in the\r\nact of stealing three dead bodies from the parish burial-ground of St.\r\nPancras, or St. Giles, which were separated only by a wall. The men were\r\napprehended by the horse patrol of the Hampstead and Highgate district.\r\nThere was some difficulty in carrying on the case, as, until it was\r\ndetermined from which burial-ground the bodies had been taken, it could\r\nnot be said which parish was the real prosecutor. Light attempted to\r\nescape, but was secured. The newspaper adds, \"and, from the frequency of\r\nsuch offences, strong indignation was excited in the neighbourhood, from\r\nwhence a crowd attended at the office.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHolliss was originally a sexton, and, like so many of his class, came into\r\nthe pay of the Resurrectionists; at last his demands became so exorbitant\r\nthat the resurrection-men refused to pay him, and informed his employers\r\nof what had been taking place. He was at once dismissed, and, having no\r\nother means of livelihood, he joined the resurrection-men. He saved money,\r\nand afterwards purchased a hackney coach, which he himself drove. Like\r\nmost of his companions, Holliss came to a bad end. Harnett, the younger,\r\nhad been to France, and had brought away with him a large number of\r\nteeth, which he valued at £700; these he entrusted to his daughter, who\r\nleft them in a hackney carriage. The driver found the teeth, and, not\r\nknowing how to dispose of them, consulted his friend, Holliss. Holliss\r\noffered £5 for the teeth, and promised an extra sum if they sold well.\r\nHarnett had made known his loss to Holliss, so that he knew perfectly well\r\nto whom the teeth belonged. Thinking that he could make more money by\r\nselling them privately than by trusting to a reward from Harnett, he began\r\nto dispose of the teeth to dentists. Harnett made enquiries of some of his\r\ncustomers as to whether they had lately been offered teeth for sale, and\r\nwas shown some lately purchased from Holliss; these he was able to\r\nidentify. Holliss was at once given into custody, and was tried at\r\nCroydon; he escaped transportation through a flaw in the indictment.\r\nWhilst he was in gaol awaiting his trial, Harnett seized Holliss' house\r\nand all his household furniture for a debt of £83. Holliss was afterwards\r\nmixed up in a horse-stealing case, and ultimately died in great poverty\r\nand wretchedness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"N.\" or Joseph Naples, the writer of the Diary, is described by Bransby\r\nCooper as \"a civil and well conducted man, slight in person, with a\r\npleasing expression of countenance, and of respectful manners.\" He was the\r\nson of a respectable stationer and bookbinder, and in early life went as a\r\nsailor into the King's service. He was for some time on board the\r\n_Excellent_, and served in that vessel in the engagement off Cape St.\r\nVincent.[27] Then he returned to England, and, having spent all his\r\nprize-money, went on a vessel cruising about the Channel. From this he ran\r\naway and came back to London; here he obtained a situation as grave-digger\r\nto the Spa Fields burial-ground. A man named White enticed Naples into the\r\nresurrectionist business; this soon caused him to lose his situation.\r\nWhite was stopped by the patrols, and a body was found in his possession.\r\nHe managed to escape, but it was proved that the body had been taken from\r\nSpa Fields, and Naples was sentenced to two years' imprisonment. He\r\nescaped, with another prisoner, from the House of Correction by making an\r\nopening through a skylight in the roof, and afterwards scaling the outer\r\nwalls of the prison by means of a rope.\r\n\r\nHe was retaken through information given against him by Crouch, and it was\r\nonly by the mediation of Sir Astley Cooper with the Secretary of State\r\nthat Naples escaped additional punishment. In the list of prisoners\r\nwritten out by himself, and printed by Bransby Cooper (_Life_, vol. 1. p.\r\n423), Naples thus describes himself: \"Jos{h}. N----[28] 'Resurgam Hommo,'\r\nfor trial.\"\r\n\r\nThe writing and spelling in the Diary show him to have been a man of\r\nsuperior education to most of his class. He continued in the\r\nresurrectionist business up to the time of the passing of the Anatomy Act,\r\nwhen he was taken on as a servant in the dissecting-room of St. Thomas'\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is considerable difficulty in identifying many of the burial-grounds\r\nfrom which bodies are said in the Diary to have been stolen. Many of these\r\nwere private, and the name mentioned is probably either that of the\r\nproprietor or of the care-taker. No doubt, too, some of the names are\r\nslang terms which are quite forgotten at the present day.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FACSIMILE OF PAGE OF DIARY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIARY\r\n\r\n     [The spelling of the Diary has been preserved in the reprint, but as\r\n     there is no attempt at punctuation in the original, stops have here\r\n     been added to make some of the entries more intelligible.

Cooper gives an account of a Resurrectionist under the name of\r\n\"Patrick\"; this is probably the man referred to. The name is Harnell in\r\nthe _Sun_ for October 14th, 1812; it may, perhaps, be a misprint for\r\nHarnett; two men of this name have already been spoken of.\r\n\r\n[27] See also p. 126.\r\n\r\n[28] The name is suppressed in the printed copy.\r\n\r\n[29] Since the above was written, Mrs. Basil Holmes' interesting volume on\r\n_The Burial Grounds of London_ has been published. Reference to this book\r\nconfirms the statement above made. Mrs. Holmes' account is very carefully\r\ndone, and the list of the old burial-grounds is probably as complete as it\r\ncan be, but no light is thrown upon any of the difficult names used in the\r\nDiary.\r\n\r\n[30] Slang for a burial-ground.\r\n\r\n[31] Harper is probably the name of the keeper of a burial-ground.\r\n\r\n[32] This occurs often in the Diary, and was evidently a favourite place\r\nfor meeting. It was, doubtless, the entrance to some burial-ground, but\r\nthere is no evidence by which the place can be definitely determined.\r\n\r\n[33] _i.e._ a body which had had a post mortem performed on it was\r\nobtained from the burial-ground attached to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.\r\n\r\n[34] Watched to see what funerals were taking place during the day.\r\n\r\n[35] Probably Michael Mordecai, who kept an old curiosity-shop in New\r\nAlley, and was a noted receiver.\r\n\r\n[36] Probably the landlord of a public-house.\r\n\r\n[37] _i.e._ all the gang.\r\n\r\n[38] The \"Green Churchyard\" was an addition to the Churchyard of St.\r\nGiles, Cripplegate. \"Green Churchyard\" is a name which we find repeated in\r\nother parishes; for instance, it was given to the higher portion of St.\r\nJames', Piccadilly, and to the little piece by St. Bartholomew the Great,\r\napproached through the present south transept. Holmes, _loc. cit._ It is\r\nimpossible to say which of these is here meant.\r\n\r\n[39] Bunhill.\r\n\r\n[40] J. C. Carpue, the founder of the Dean Street Anatomical School.\r\n\r\n[41] Dr. Frampton, of the London Hospital.\r\n\r\n[42] James Wilson, of the Great Windmill Street School.\r\n\r\n[43] Joshua Brookes, founder of the Blenheim Street, or Great Marlborough\r\nStreet, Anatomical School: for references to Brookes, see Index.\r\n\r\n[44] See page 65.\r\n\r\n[45] Sir Charles Bell, of Great Windmill Street School.\r\n\r\n[46] Abbreviation for Harpers. See p. 139.\r\n\r\n[47] Either St. Luke's Church or St. Luke's Hospital in Old Street.\r\n\r\n[48] Words so crossed out that they cannot be deciphered; in all\r\nprobability it originally read \"with their ---- throat cut.\"\r\n\r\n[49] John Taunton, founder of the City of London Truss Society, a\r\ndemonstrator at Guy's Hospital under Cline, and at this time principal\r\nlecturer to the London Anatomical Society.\r\n\r\n[50] Artichoke Public-house.\r\n\r\n[51] See page 127.\r\n\r\n[52] Newington.\r\n\r\n[53] Slang term for bodies.\r\n\r\n[54] See page 71.\r\n\r\n[55] Afterwards Sir Astley Cooper.\r\n\r\n[56] Body putrid, and therefore of no use for anatomical purposes.\r\n\r\n[57] Probably Church of St. Thomas, Charterhouse.\r\n\r\n[58] The burial-ground for the parishes of St. Olave and St. John,\r\nSouthwark; it was taken by the \"Greenwich Railway Company\": part of the\r\napproach to the \"Flemish\" now forms the approach to London Bridge Station.\r\n\r\n[59] This is, of course, not the St. Pancras Church in the Euston Road,\r\nbut the old parish church situated on the north side of the road leading\r\nfrom King's Cross to Kentish Town.\r\n\r\n[60] See page 124.\r\n\r\n[61] Failed to get a body.\r\n\r\n[62] Bodies unsold.\r\n\r\n[63] Probably a burial-ground attached to a meeting-house.\r\n\r\n[64] The diary is torn at the margin in this place: the word \"left\" is\r\nprobably correct, but who \"the man\" was cannot be determined.\r\n\r\n[65] St. Olave's.\r\n\r\n[66] Probably from information given to the police by the other party who\r\n\"had got the adult.\"\r\n\r\n[67] The police court in Union Street, Southwark; it was removed in 1845.\r\n\r\n[68] _i.e._ had spoiled them for anatomical purposes; very likely to be\r\ndone out of spite, as on the previous day they had \"row'd with Ben,\"\r\n_i.e._ Crouch; see page 49.\r\n\r\n[69] Evidently for debt.\r\n\r\n[70] Millard was superintendent of the dissecting-room at St. Thomas'; he\r\nwas an avaricious man, and lost this situation through dealing in bodies.\r\nHis plan was to take them in at the hospital from the resurrection-men,\r\nand then to sell them at an advanced price in Edinburgh unknown to the men\r\nwho supplied him, and to the teachers at the hospital. Millard was popular\r\nwith the pupils, and, after his dismissal, they persuaded him to take an\r\neating-house in the neighbourhood of St. Thomas'. As there was money to be\r\nmade in the \"resurrection\" traffic, he did not abandon his connection with\r\nthe body-snatchers. This came to be known, and created a strong prejudice\r\nagainst him; so much so that his legitimate business fell off to such an\r\nextent as to make it necessary for him to relinquish it altogether. Then\r\nhe took entirely to the resurrection business, and was sentenced to three\r\nmonths' imprisonment for taking a body from the burial-ground attached to\r\nthe London Hospital. He appealed against the sentence, and found bail.\r\nThen he brought an action against the magistrate at Lambeth for false\r\nimprisonment; this was set aside, and Millard was sent back to Cold Bath\r\nFields to complete his sentence. He tried hard to get Sir Astley Cooper to\r\nsolicit a pardon for him, but without avail. This so preyed on his mind\r\nthat he threatened Sir Astley with bodily injury. Ultimately Millard quite\r\nlost his reason, and died in gaol. In 1825 his widow published a pamphlet\r\nentitled, \"An Account of the circumstances attending the imprisonment and\r\ndeath of the late William Millard, formerly superintendent of the Theatre\r\nof Anatomy of St. Thomas' Hospital, Southwark.\" The pamphlet states that\r\nMillard had notice to leave St. Thomas' because it was found that he was\r\nsupplying Mr. Grainger with bodies, and that Sir Astley Cooper was\r\ndetermined to put an end to the school which Grainger had established. The\r\npublication is of a very abusive character; the surgeon of the gaol, Mr.\r\nWakley, of the _Lancet_, and the authorities at the hospital, all come in\r\nfor severe censure. The whole tone of the pamphlet is so exaggerated that\r\nit is impossible to tell whether there is any truth in Mrs. Millard's\r\ngrievances.\r\n\r\n[71] Extremities.\r\n\r\n[72] These words are illegible.\r\n\r\n[73] St. Pancras.\r\n\r\n[74] Male.\r\n\r\n[75] Mr. Edward Stanley, Surgeon to St. Bartholomew's Hospital.\r\n\r\n[76] Private door into the burial-ground, probably generally left unlocked\r\nfor them by the custodian; for some special reason it was closed on this\r\nparticular night.\r\n\r\n[77] In all probability Israel Chapman, a Jew, who was in the resurrection\r\ntrade; the object of following was to try and prevent his doing any\r\nbusiness. (See page 49.) The next entry shows that the Jew had sold a body\r\nat St. Bartholomew's; there was \"a row\" at this, and, no doubt, \"the\r\nregular men\" had to be pacified.\r\n\r\n[78] Placed there by friends of the deceased, in all probability.\r\n\r\n[79] Opened two graves; one body too decomposed to bring away, so they\r\ndrew the canine teeth and sold them.\r\n\r\n[80] Words crossed out and illegible in the MS.\r\n\r\n[81] Tom Light.\r\n\r\n[82] See also p. 129.\r\n\r\n[83] The words in brackets are crossed out in the MS.\r\n\r\n[84] _i.e._ The clothes specially used for resurrection work; they would\r\nnaturally be clay-stained, and if worn during the day would betray their\r\nowner's occupation.\r\n\r\n[85] Probably slang for a funeral.\r\n\r\n[86] Blue Lion.\r\n\r\n[87] Canine teeth.\r\n\r\n[88] The watchman.\r\n\r\n[89] _i.e._ got 6 adults, 1 small, and 1 foetus from St. Pancras: these\r\nwere taken to S.
