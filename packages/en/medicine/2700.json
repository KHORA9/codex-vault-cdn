Negatives multiplied into each other change their sign and\r\nbecome positives. Hostile criticisms meeting together are often\r\nequivalent to praise, and the square of fault-finding turns out to be\r\nthe same thing as eulogy.\r\n\r\nBut a writer has rarely so many enemies as it pleases him to believe.\r\nSelf-love leads us to overrate the numbers of our negative constituency.\r\nThe larger portion of my limited circle of readers must be quite\r\nindifferent to, if not ignorant of, the adverse opinions which have been\r\nexpressed or recorded concerning any of these Addresses or Essays now\r\nsubmitted to their own judgment. It is proper, however, to inform\r\nthem, that some of the positions maintained in these pages have been\r\nunsparingly attacked, with various degrees of ability, scholarship,\r\nand good-breeding. The tone of criticism naturally changes with local\r\nconditions in different parts of a country extended like our own, so\r\nthat it is one of the most convenient gauges of the partial movements in\r\nthe direction of civilization. It is satisfactory to add, that the views\r\nassailed have also been unflinchingly defended by unsought champions,\r\namong the ablest of whom it is pleasant to mention, at this moment of\r\npolitical alienation, the Editor of the Charleston Medical Journal.\r\n\r\n“Currents and Counter-Currents” was written and delivered as an Oration,\r\na florid rhetorical composition, expressly intended to secure the\r\nattention of an audience not easy to hold as listeners. It succeeded\r\nin doing this, and also in being as curiously misunderstood and\r\nmisrepresented as if it had been a political harangue. This gave it more\r\nlocal notoriety than it might otherwise have attained, so that, as I\r\nlearn, one ingenious person made use of its title as an advertisement to\r\na production of his own.\r\n\r\nThe commonest mode of misrepresentation was this: qualified\r\npropositions, the whole meaning of which depended on the qualifications,\r\nwere stripped of these and taken as absolute. Thus, the attempt to\r\nestablish a presumption against giving poisons to sick persons was\r\nconsidered as equivalent to condemning the use of these substances.\r\nThe only important inference the writer has been able to draw from the\r\ngreater number of the refutations of his opinions which have been kindly\r\nsent him, is that the preliminary education of the Medical Profession is\r\nnot always what it ought to be.\r\n\r\nOne concession he is willing to make, whatever sacrifice of pride it\r\nmay involve. The story of Massasoit, which has furnished a coral, as it\r\nwere, for some teething critics, when subjected to a powerful logical\r\nanalysis, though correct in its essentials, proves to have been told\r\nwith exceptionable breadth of statement, and therefore (to resume\r\nthe metaphor) has been slightly rounded off at its edges, so as to\r\nbe smoother for any who may wish to bite upon it hereafter. In\r\nother respects the Discourse has hardly been touched. It is only an\r\nindividual's expression, in his own way, of opinions entertained by\r\nhundreds of the Medical Profession in every civilized country, and has\r\nnothing in it which on revision the writer sees cause to retract or\r\nmodify. The superstitions it attacks lie at the very foundation of\r\nHomoeopathy, and of almost every form of medical charlatanism. Still\r\nthe mere routinists and unthinking artisans in most callings dislike\r\nwhatever shakes the dust out of their traditions, and it may be\r\nunreasonable to expect that Medicine will always prove an exception to\r\nthe rule. One half the opposition which the numerical system of Louis\r\nhas met with, as applied to the results of treatment, has been owing\r\nto the fact that it showed the movements of disease to be far more\r\nindependent of the kind of practice pursued than was agreeable to the\r\npride of those whose self-confidence it abated.\r\n\r\nThe statement, that medicines are more sparingly used in physicians'\r\nfamilies than in most others, admits of a very natural explanation,\r\nwithout putting a harsh construction upon it, which it was not\r\nintended to admit. Outside pressure is less felt in the physician's own\r\nhousehold; that is all. If this does not sometimes influence him to give\r\nmedicine, or what seems to be medicine, when among those who have more\r\nconfidence in drugging than his own family commonly has, the learned\r\nProfessor Dunglison is hereby requested to apologize for his definition\r\nof the word Placebo, or to expunge it from his Medical Dictionary.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain. A loud outcry on a slight touch reveals the weak\r\nspot in a profession, as well as in a patient. It is a doubtful policy\r\nto oppose the freest speech in those of our own number who are trying to\r\nshow us where they honestly believe our weakness lies. Vast as are\r\nthe advances of our Science and Art, may it not possibly prove on\r\nexamination that we retain other old barbarisms beside the use of the\r\nastrological sign of Jupiter, with which we endeavor to insure good luck\r\nto our prescriptions? Is it the act of a friend or a foe to try to point\r\nthem out to our brethren when asked to address them, and is the speaker\r\nto subdue the constitutional habit of his style to a given standard,\r\nunder penalty of giving offence to a grave assembly?\r\n\r\n“Homoeopathy and its Kindred Delusions” was published nearly twenty\r\nyears ago, and has been long out of print, so that the author tried in\r\nvain to procure a copy until the kindness of a friend supplied him with\r\nthe only one he has had for years. A foolish story reached his ears that\r\nhe was attempting to buy up stray copies for the sake of suppressing it.\r\nThis edition was in the press at that very time.\r\n\r\nMany of the arguments contained in the Lectures have lost whatever\r\nnovelty they may have possessed. All its predictions have been submitted\r\nto the formidable test of time. They appear to have stood it, so far,\r\nabout as well as most uninspired prophecies; indeed, some of them\r\nrequire much less accommodation than certain grave commentators employ\r\nin their readings of the ancient Prophets.\r\n\r\nIf some statistics recently published are correct, Homoeopathy has made\r\nvery slow progress in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn all England, as it appears, there are hardly a fifth more\r\nHomoeopathic practitioners than there are students attending Lectures at\r\nthe Massachusetts Medical College at the present time. In America it has\r\nundoubtedly proved more popular and lucrative, yet how loose a hold it\r\nhas on the public confidence is shown by the fact that, when a specially\r\nvalued life, which has been played with by one of its agents, is\r\nseriously threatened, the first thing we expect to hear is that a\r\nregular practitioner is by the patient's bed, and the Homoeopathic\r\ncounsellor overruled or discarded. Again, how many of the ardent and\r\ncapricious persons who embraced Homoeopathy have run the whole round of\r\npretentious novelties;--have been boarded at water-cure establishments,\r\ncloseted with uterine and other specialists, and finally wandered over\r\nseas to put themselves in charge of foreign celebrities, who dosed them\r\nas lustily as they were ever dosed before they took to globules! It\r\nwill surprise many to learn to what a shadow of a shade Homoeopathy\r\nhas dwindled in the hands of many of its noted practitioners. The\r\nitch-doctrine is treated with contempt. Infinitesimal doses are replaced\r\nby full ones whenever the fancy-practitioner chooses. Good Homoeopathic\r\nreasons can be found for employing anything that anybody wants to\r\nemploy. Homoeopathy is now merely a name, an unproved theory, and a box\r\nof pellets pretending to be specifics, which, as all of us know, fail\r\nignominiously in those cases where we would thankfully sacrifice all our\r\nprejudices and give the world to have them true to their promises.\r\n\r\nHomoeopathy has not died out so rapidly as Tractoration. Perhaps it was\r\nwell that it should not, for it has taught us a lesson of the healing\r\nfaculty of Nature which was needed, and for which many of us have made\r\nproper acknowledgments. But it probably does more harm than good to\r\nmedical science at the present time, by keeping up the delusion of\r\ntreating everything by specifics,--the old barbarous notion that sick\r\npeople should feed on poisons [Lachesis, arrow-poison, obtained from a\r\nserpent (Pulte). Crotalus horridus, rattlesnake's venom (Neidhard). The\r\nless dangerous Pediculus capitis is the favorite remedy of Dr. Mure, the\r\nEnglish “Apostle of Homoeopathy.” These are examples of the retrograde\r\ncurrent setting towards barbarism] against which a part of the Discourse\r\nat the beginning of this volume is directed.\r\n\r\nThe infinitesimal globules have not become a curiosity as yet, like\r\nPerkins's Tractors. But time is a very elastic element in Geology and\r\nProphecy. If Daniel's seventy weeks mean four hundred and ninety years,\r\nas the learned Prideaux and others have settled it that they do, the\r\n“not many years” of my prediction may be stretched out a generation or\r\ntwo beyond our time, if necessary, when the prophecy will no doubt prove\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIt might be fitting to add a few words with regard to the Essay on the\r\nContagiousness of Puerperal Fever. But the whole question I consider\r\nto be now transferred from the domain of medical inquiry to the\r\nconsideration of Life Insurance agencies and Grand Juries. For the\r\njustification of this somewhat sharply accented language I must refer\r\nthe reader to the paper itself for details which I regret to have been\r\nforced to place on permanent record.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, January, 1861.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SECOND PREFACE.\r\n\r\nThese Lectures and Essays are arranged in the order corresponding to\r\nthe date of their delivery or publication. They must, of course, be read\r\nwith a constant reference to these dates, by such as care to read\r\nthem. I have not attempted to modernize their aspect or character in\r\npresenting them, in this somewhat altered connection, to the public.\r\nSeveral of them were contained in a former volume which received its\r\nname from the Address called “Currents and Counter-Currents.” Some of\r\nthose contained in the former volume have been replaced by others. The\r\nEssay called “Mechanism of Vital Actions” has been transferred to a\r\ndistinct collection of Miscellaneous essays, forming a separate volume.\r\n\r\nI had some intention of including with these papers an Essay on\r\nIntermittent Fever in New England, which received one of the Boylston\r\nprizes in 1837, and was published in the following year. But as this\r\nwas upon a subject of local interest, chiefly, and would have taken up a\r\ngood deal of room, I thought it best to leave it out, trusting that\r\nthe stray copies to be met with in musty book-shops would sufficiently\r\nsupply the not very extensive or urgent demand for a paper almost half a\r\ncentury old.\r\n\r\nSome of these papers created a little stir when they first fell from\r\nthe press into the pool of public consciousness. They will slide in very\r\nquietly now in this new edition, and find out for themselves whether the\r\nwaters are those of Lethe, or whether they are to live for a time as not\r\nwholly unvalued reminiscences.\r\n\r\nMarch 21, 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION.\r\n\r\nThese Essays are old enough now to go alone without staff or crutch\r\nin the shape of Prefaces. A very few words may be a convenience to the\r\nreader who takes up the book and wishes to know what he is likely to\r\nfind in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n        HOMOEOPATHY AND ITS KINDRED DELUSIONS.\r\n\r\nHomoeopathy has proved lucrative, and so long as it continues to be so\r\nwill surely exist,--as surely as astrology, palmistry, and other methods\r\nof getting a living out of the weakness and credulity of mankind and\r\nwomankind. Though it has no pretensions to be considered as belonging\r\namong the sciences, it may be looked upon by a scientific man as a\r\ncurious object of study among the vagaries of the human mind. Its\r\ninfluence for good or the contrary may be made a matter of calm\r\ninvestigation. I have studied it in the Essay before the reader, under\r\nthe aspect of an extravagant and purely imaginative creation of its\r\nfounder. Since that first essay was written, nearly half a century ago,\r\nwe have all had a chance to witness its practical working. Two opposite\r\ninferences may be drawn from its doctrines and practice. The first is\r\nthat which is accepted by its disciples. This is that all diseases are\r\n“cured” by drugs. The opposite conclusion is drawn by a much larger\r\nnumber of persons. As they see that patients are very commonly getting\r\nwell under treatment by infinitesimal drugging, which they consider\r\nequivalent to no medication at all, they come to disbelieve in every\r\nform of drugging and put their whole trust in “nature.” Thus experience,\r\n\r\n\r\n     “From seeming evil still educing good,”\r\n\r\nhas shown that the dealers in this preposterous system of\r\npseudo-therapeutics have cooperated with the wiser class of\r\npractitioners in breaking up the system of over-dosing and over-drugging\r\nwhich has been one of the standing reproaches of medical practice. While\r\nkeeping up the miserable delusion that diseases were all to be “cured”\r\n by drugging, Homoeopathy has been unintentionally showing that they\r\nwould very generally get well without any drugging at all. In the mean\r\ntime the newer doctrines of the “mind cure,” the “faith cure,” and the\r\nrest are encroaching on the territory so long monopolized by that most\r\ningenious of the pseudo-sciences. It would not be surprising if its\r\nwhole ground should be taken possession of by these new claimants with\r\ntheir flattering appeals to the imaginative class of persons open to\r\nsuch attacks. Similia similabus may prove fatally true for once, if\r\nHomoeopathy is killed out by its new-born rivals.\r\n\r\nIt takes a very moderate amount of erudition to unearth a charlatan\r\nlike the supposed father of the infinitesimal dosing system. The real\r\ninventor of that specious trickery was an Irishman by the name of\r\nButler. The whole story is to be found in the “Ortus Medicinae” of Van\r\nHelmont. I have given some account of his chapter “Butler” in different\r\narticles, but I would refer the students of our Homoeopathic educational\r\ninstitutions to the original, which they will find very interesting and\r\ncurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n          CURRENTS AND COUNTER-CURRENTS\r\n\r\nMy attack on over-drugging brought out some hostile comments and\r\ntreatment. Thirty years ago I expressed myself with more vivacity than\r\nI should show if I were writing on the same subjects today. Some of\r\nmy more lively remarks called out very sharp animadversion. Thus\r\nmy illustration of prevention as often better than treatment in the\r\nmother's words to her child which had got a poisonous berry in its\r\nmouth,--“Spit it out!” gave mortal offence to a well-known New York\r\npractitioner and writer, who advised the Massachusetts Medical Society\r\nto spit out the offending speaker. Worse than this was my statement of\r\nmy belief that if a ship-load of miscellaneous drugs, with certain\r\nvery important exceptions,--drugs, many of which were then often given\r\nneedlessly and in excess, as then used “could be sunk to the bottom of\r\nthe sea, it would be all the better for mankind and all the worse\r\nfor the fishes.” This was too bad. The sentence was misquoted, quoted\r\nwithout its qualifying conditions, and frightened some of my worthy\r\nprofessional brethren as much as if I had told them to throw all physic\r\nto the dogs. But for the epigrammatic sting the sentiment would have\r\nbeen unnoticed as a harmless overstatement at the very worst.\r\n\r\nSince this lecture was delivered a great and, as I think, beneficial\r\nchange has taken place in the practice of medicine. The habit of the\r\nEnglish “general practitioner” of making his profit out of the pills and\r\npotions he administered was ruinous to professional advancement and the\r\ndignity of the physician. When a half-starving medical man felt that he\r\nmust give his patient draught and boluses for which he could charge him,\r\nhe was in a pitiable position and too likely to persuade himself that\r\nhis drugs were useful to his patient because they were profitable\r\nto him. This practice has prevailed a good deal in America, and was\r\ndoubtless the source in some measure of the errors I combated.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE CONTAGIOUSNESS OF PUERPERAL FEVER.\r\n\r\nThis Essay was read before a small Association called “The Society for\r\nMedical Improvement,” and published in a Medical Journal which lasted\r\nbut a single year. It naturally attracted less attention than it would\r\nhave done if published in such a periodical as the “American Journal of\r\nMedical Sciences.” Still it had its effect, as I have every reason\r\nto believe. I cannot doubt that it has saved the lives of many young\r\nmothers by calling attention to the existence and propagation of\r\n“Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence,” and laying down rules for\r\ntaking the necessary precautions against it. The case has long been\r\ndecided in favor of the views I advocated, but, at the time when I wrote\r\ntwo of the most celebrated professors of Obstetrics in this country\r\nopposed my conclusions with all the weight of their experience and\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThis paper was written in a great heat and with passionate indignation.\r\nIf I touched it at all I might trim its rhetorical exuberance, but I\r\nprefer to leave it all its original strength of expression. I could not,\r\nif I had tried, have disguised the feelings with which I regarded the\r\nattempt to put out of sight the frightful facts which I brought forward\r\nand the necessary conclusions to which they led. Of course the whole\r\nmatter has been looked at in a new point of view since the microbe as\r\na vehicle of contagion has been brought into light, and explained the\r\nmechanism of that which was plain enough as a fact to all who were not\r\nblind or who did not shut their eyes.\r\n\r\nO. W. H.\r\n\r\nBEVERLY Farms, Mass., August 3, 1891\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMOEOPATHY AND ITS KINDRED DELUSIONS\r\n\r\n[Two lectures delivered before the Boston Society for the Diffusion of\r\nUseful Knowledge. 1842.]\r\n\r\n[When a physician attempts to convince a person, who has fallen into the\r\nHomoeopathic delusion, of the emptiness of its pretensions, he is often\r\nanswered by a statement of cases in which its practitioners are thought\r\nto have effected wonderful cures. The main object of the first of these\r\nLectures is to show, by abundant facts, that such statements, made by\r\npersons unacquainted with the fluctuations of disease and the fallacies\r\nof observation, are to be considered in general as of little or no value\r\nin establishing the truth of a medical doctrine or the utility of a\r\nmethod of practice.\r\n\r\nThose kind friends who suggest to a person suffering from a tedious\r\ncomplaint, that he “Had better try Homoeopathy,” are apt to enforce\r\ntheir suggestion by adding, that “at any rate it can do no harm.” This\r\nmay or may not be true as regards the individual. But it always does\r\nvery great harm to the community to encourage ignorance, error, or\r\ndeception in a profession which deals with the life and health of our\r\nfellow-creatures. Whether or not those who countenance Homoeopathy are\r\nguilty of this injustice towards others, the second of these Lectures\r\nmay afford them some means of determining.\r\n\r\nTo deny that good effects may happen from the observance of diet and\r\nregimen when prescribed by Homoeopathists as well as by others, would be\r\nvery unfair to them. But to suppose that men with minds so constituted\r\nas to accept such statements and embrace such doctrines as make up\r\nthe so-called science of Homoeopathy are more competent than others to\r\nregulate the circumstances which influence the human body in health and\r\ndisease, would be judging very harshly the average capacity of ordinary\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\nTo deny that some patients may have been actually benefited through\r\nthe influence exerted upon their imaginations, would be to refuse\r\nto Homoeopathy what all are willing to concede to every one of those\r\nnumerous modes of practice known to all intelligent persons by an\r\nopprobrious title.\r\n\r\nSo long as the body is affected through the mind, no audacious device,\r\neven of the most manifestly dishonest character, can fail of producing\r\noccasional good to those who yield it an implicit or even a partial\r\nfaith. The argument founded on this occasional good would be as\r\napplicable in justifying the counterfeiter and giving circulation to\r\nhis base coin, on the ground that a spurious dollar had often relieved a\r\npoor man's necessities.\r\n\r\nHomoeopathy has come before our public at a period when the growing\r\nspirit of eclecticism has prepared many ingenious and honest minds to\r\nlisten to all new doctrines with a candor liable to degenerate into\r\nweakness. It is not impossible that the pretended evolution of great and\r\nmysterious virtues from infinitely attenuated atoms may have enticed a\r\nfew over-refining philosophers, who have slid into a vague belief\r\nthat matter subdivided grows less material, and approaches nearer to\r\na spiritual nature as it requires a more powerful microscope for its\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, some persons seem disposed to take the ground of\r\nMenzel that the Laity must pass formal judgment between the Physician\r\nand the Homoeopathist, as it once did between Luther and the Romanists.\r\nThe practitioner and the scholar must not, therefore, smile at the\r\namount of time and labor expended in these Lectures upon this shadowy\r\nsystem; which, in the calm and serious judgment of many of the wisest\r\nmembers of the medical profession, is not entitled by anything it has\r\never said or done to the notoriety of a public rebuke, still less to the\r\nhonors of critical martyrdom.]\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nI have selected four topics for this lecture, the first three of which I\r\nshall touch but slightly, the last more fully. They are\r\n\r\n1. The Royal cure of the King's Evil, or Scrofula.\r\n\r\n2. The Weapon Ointment, and its twin absurdity, the Sympathetic Powder.\r\n\r\n3. The Tar-water mania of Bishop Berkeley.\r\n\r\n4. The History of the Metallic Tractors, or Perkinism.\r\n\r\nThe first two illustrate the ease with which numerous facts are\r\naccumulated to prove the most fanciful and senseless extravagances.\r\n\r\nThe third exhibits the entire insufficiency of exalted wisdom,\r\nimmaculate honesty, and vast general acquirements to make a good\r\nphysician of a great bishop.\r\n\r\nThe fourth shows us the intimate machinery of an extinct delusion, which\r\nflourished only forty years ago; drawn in all its details, as being\r\na rich and comparatively recent illustration of the pretensions, the\r\narguments, the patronage, by means of which windy errors have long been,\r\nand will long continue to be, swollen into transient consequence.\r\nAll display in superfluous abundance the boundless credulity and\r\nexcitability of mankind upon subjects connected with medicine.\r\n\r\n“From the time of Edward the Confessor to Queen Anne, the monarchs of\r\nEngland were in the habit of touching those who were brought to them\r\nsuffering with the scrofula, for the cure of that distemper. William\r\nthe Third had good sense enough to discontinue the practice, but Anne\r\nresumed it, and, among her other patients, performed the royal operation\r\nupon a child, who, in spite of his, disease, grew up at last into Samuel\r\nJohnson. After laying his hand upon the sufferers, it was customary for\r\nthe monarch to hang a gold piece around the neck of each patient. Very\r\nstrict precautions were adopted to prevent those who thought more of the\r\ngolden angel hung round the neck by a white ribbon, than of relief of\r\ntheir bodily infirmities, from making too many calls, as they sometimes\r\nattempted to do. According to the statement of the advocates and\r\ncontemporaries of this remedy, none ever failed of receiving benefit\r\nunless their little faith and credulity starved their merits. Some are\r\nsaid to have been cured immediately on the very touch, others did not\r\nso easily get rid of their swellings, until they were touched a second\r\ntime. Several cases are related, of persons who had been blind for\r\nseveral weeks, and months, and obliged even to be led to Whitehall, yet\r\nrecovered their sight immediately upon being touched, so as to walk away\r\nwithout any guide.” So widely, at one period, was the belief diffused,\r\nthat, in the course of twelve years, nearly a hundred thousand persons\r\nwere touched by Charles the Second. Catholic divines; in disputes upon\r\nthe orthodoxy of their church, did not deny that the power had descended\r\nto protestant princes;--Dr. Harpsfield, in his “Ecclesiastical History\r\nof England,” admitted it, and in Wiseman's words, “when Bishop Tooker\r\nwould make use of this Argument to prove the Truth of our Church,\r\nSmitheus doth not thereupon go about to deny the Matter of fact; nay,\r\nboth he and Cope acknowledge it.” “I myself,” says Wiseman, the best\r\nEnglish surgical writer of his day,[Edinburgh Medical and Surgical\r\nJournal, vol. iii. p. 103.]--“I my self have been a frequent Eye-witness\r\nof many hundred of Cures performed by his Majesties Touch alone, without\r\nany assistance of Chirurgery; and those, many of them such as had tired\r\nout the endeavours of able Chirurgeons before they came hither. It were\r\nendless to recite what I myself have seen, and what I have received\r\nacknowledgments of by Letter, not only from the severall parts of this\r\nNation, but also from Ireland, Scotland, Jersey, Garnsey. It is needless\r\nalso to remember what Miracles of this nature were performed by the very\r\nBloud of his late Majesty of Blessed memory, after whose decollation\r\nby the inhuman Barbarity of the Regicides, the reliques of that were\r\ngathered on Chips and in Handkerchieffs by the pious Devotes, who could\r\nnot but think so great a suffering in so honourable and pious a Cause,\r\nwould be attended by an extraordinary assistance of God, and some more\r\nthen ordinary a miracle: nor did their Faith deceive them in this there\r\npoint, being so many hundred that found the benefit of it.” [Severall\r\nChirurgicall Treatises. London.1676. p. 246.]\r\n\r\nObstinate and incredulous men, as he tells us, accounted for these cures\r\nin three ways: by the journey and change of air the patients obtained\r\nin coming to London; by the influence of imagination; and the wearing of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nTo these objections he answers, 1st. That many of those cured were\r\ninhabitants of the city. 2d. That the subjects of treatment were\r\nfrequently infants. 3d. That sometimes silver was given, and sometimes\r\nnothing, yet the patients were cured.\r\n\r\nA superstition resembling this probably exists at the present time\r\nin some ignorant districts of England and this country. A writer in a\r\nMedical Journal in the year 1807, speaks of a farmer in Devonshire, who,\r\nbeing a ninth son of a ninth son, is thought endowed with healing powers\r\nlike those of ancient royalty, and who is accustomed one day in every\r\nweek to strike for the evil.\r\n\r\nI remember that one of my schoolmates told me, when a boy, of a seventh\r\nson of a seventh son, somewhere in Essex County, who touched for the\r\nscrofula, and who used to hang a silver fourpence halfpenny about the\r\nneck of those who came to him, which fourpence halfpenny it was solemnly\r\naffirmed became of a remarkably black color after having been some time\r\nworn, and that his own brother had been subjected to this extraordinary\r\ntreatment; but I must add that my schoolmate drew a bow of remarkable\r\nlength, strength, and toughness for his tender years.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious examples of the fallacy of popular belief and\r\nthe uncertainty of asserted facts in medical experience is to be found\r\nin the history of the UNGUENTUM ARMARIUM, or WEAPON OINTMENT.\r\n\r\nFabricius Hildanus, whose name is familiar to every surgical scholar,\r\nand Lord Bacon, who frequently dipped a little into medicine, are\r\nmy principal authorities for the few circumstances I shall mention\r\nregarding it. The Weapon Ointment was a preparation used for the healing\r\nof wounds, but instead of its being applied to them, the injured\r\npart was washed and bandaged, and the weapon with which the wound was\r\ninflicted was carefully anointed with the unguent. Empirics, ignorant\r\nbarbers, and men of that sort, are said to have especially employed it.\r\nStill there were not wanting some among the more respectable members of\r\nthe medical profession who supported its claims. The composition of this\r\nointment was complicated, in the different formulae given by different\r\nauthorities; but some substances addressed to the imagination, rather\r\nthan the wound or weapon, entered into all. Such were portions of mummy,\r\nof human blood, and of moss from the skull of a thief hung in chains.\r\n\r\nHildanus was a wise and learned man, one of the best surgeons of his\r\ntime. He was fully aware that a part of the real secret of the Unguentum\r\nArmarium consisted in the washing and bandaging the wound and then\r\nletting it alone. But he could not resist the solemn assertions\r\nrespecting its efficacy; he gave way before the outcry of facts, and\r\ntherefore, instead of denying all their pretensions, he admitted and\r\ntried to account for them upon supernatural grounds. As the virtue of\r\nthose applications, he says, which are made to the weapon cannot\r\nreach the wound, and as they can produce no effect without contact, it\r\nfollows, of necessity, that the Devil must have a hand in the\r\nbusiness; and as he is by far the most long headed and experienced of\r\npractitioners, he cannot find this a matter of any great difficulty.\r\nHildanus himself reports, in detail, the case of a lady who had received\r\na moderate wound, for which the Unguentum Armarium was employed without\r\nthe slightest use. Yet instead of receiving this flat case of failure as\r\nany evidence against the remedy, he accounts for its not succeeding\r\nby the devout character of the lady, and her freedom from that\r\nsuperstitious and over-imaginative tendency which the Devil requires in\r\nthose who are to be benefited by his devices.\r\n\r\nLord Bacon speaks of the Weapon Ointment, in his Natural History, as\r\nhaving in its favor the testimony of men of credit, though, in his own\r\nlanguage, he himself “as yet is not fully inclined to believe it.” His\r\nremarks upon the asserted facts respecting it show a mixture of wise\r\nsuspicion and partial belief. He does not like the precise directions\r\ngiven as to the circumstances under which the animals from which some of\r\nthe materials were obtained were to be killed; for he thought it looked\r\nlike a provision for an excuse in case of failure, by laying the fault\r\nto the omission of some of these circumstances. But he likes well that\r\n“they do not observe the confecting of the Ointment under any certain\r\nconstellation; which is commonly the excuse of magical medicines, when\r\nthey fail, that they were not made under a fit figure of heaven.” [This\r\nwas a mistake, however, since the two recipes given by Hildanus are both\r\nvery explicit as to the aspect of the heavens required for different\r\nstages of the process.] “It was pretended that if the offending weapon\r\ncould not be had, it would serve the purpose to anoint a wooden one made\r\nlike it.” “This,” says Bacon, “I should doubt to be a device to keep\r\nthis strange form of cure in request and use; because many times you\r\ncannot come by the weapon itself.” And in closing his remarks on the\r\nstatements of the advocates of the ointment, he says, “Lastly, it\r\nwill cure a beast as well as a man, which I like best of all the\r\nrest, because it subjecteth the matter to an easy trial.” It is worth\r\nremembering, that more than two hundred years ago, when an absurd and\r\nfantastic remedy was asserted to possess wonderful power, and when\r\nsensible persons ascribed its pretended influence to imagination, it was\r\nboldly answered that the cure took place when the wounded party did not\r\nknow of the application made to the weapon, and even when a brute animal\r\nwas the subject of the experiment, and that this assertion, as we all\r\nknow it was, came in such a shape as to shake the incredulity of the\r\nkeenest thinker of his time. The very same assertion has been since\r\nrepeated in favor of Perkinism, and, since that, of Homoeopathy.\r\n\r\nThe same essential idea as that of the Weapon Ointment reproduced itself\r\nin the still more famous SYMPATHETIC POWDER. This Powder was said to\r\nhave the faculty, if applied to the blood-stained garments of a wounded\r\nperson, to cure his injuries, even though he were at a great distance at\r\nthe time. A friar, returning from the East, brought the recipe to Europe\r\nsomewhat before the middle of the seventeenth century. The Grand Duke of\r\nFlorence, in which city the friar was residing, heard of his cures, and\r\ntried, but without success, to obtain his secret. Sir Kenehn Digby, an\r\nEnglishman well known to fame, was fortunate enough to do him a favor,\r\nwhich wrought upon his feelings and induced him to impart to his\r\nbenefactor the composition of his extraordinary Powder. This English\r\nknight was at different periods of his life an admiral, a theologian, a\r\ncritic, a metaphysician, a politician, and a disciple of Alchemy. As is\r\nnot unfrequent with versatile and inflammable people, he caught fire at\r\nthe first spark of a new medical discovery, and no sooner got home to\r\nEngland than he began to spread the conflagration.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity soon offered itself to try the powers of the famous\r\npowder. Mr. J. Howell, having been wounded in endeavoring to part two\r\nof his friends who were fighting a duel, submitted himself to a trial\r\nof the Sympathetic Powder. Four days after he received his wounds, Sir\r\nKenehn dipped one of Mr. Howell's gaiters in a solution of the Powder,\r\nand immediately, it is said, the wounds, which were very painful,\r\ngrew easy, although the patient, who was conversing in a corner of the\r\nchamber, had not, the least idea of what was doing with his garter. He\r\nthen returned home, leaving his garter in the hands of Sir Kenelm, who\r\nhad hung it up to dry, when Mr. Howell sent his servant in a great hurry\r\nto tell him that his wounds were paining him horribly; the garter was\r\ntherefore replaced in the solution of the Powder, “and the patient got\r\nwell after five or six days of its continued immersion.”\r\n\r\nKing James First, his son Charles the First, the Duke of Buckingham,\r\nthen prime minister, and all the principal personages of the time, were\r\ncognizant of this fact; and James himself, being curious to know the\r\nsecret of this remedy, asked it of Sir Kenelm, who revealed it to him,\r\nand his Majesty had the opportunity of making several trials of its\r\nefficacy, “which all succeeded in a surprising manner.” [Dict. des\r\nSciences Medieales.]\r\n\r\nThe king's physician, Dr. Mayerne, was made master of the secret,\r\nwhich he carried to France and communicated to the Duke of Mayenne, who\r\nperformed many cures by means of it, and taught it to his surgeon, who,\r\nafter the Duke's death, sold it to many distinguished persons, by whose\r\nagency it soon ceased to be a secret. What was this wonderful substance\r\nwhich so astonished kings, princes, dukes, knights, and doctors? Nothing\r\nbut powdered blue vitriol. But it was made to undergo several processes\r\nthat conferred on it extraordinary virtues. Twice or thrice it was to be\r\ndissolved, filtered, and crystallized. The crystals were to be laid in\r\nthe sun during the months of June, July, and August, taking care to\r\nturn them carefully that all should be exposed. Then they were to be\r\npowdered, triturated, and again exposed to the sun, again reduced to a\r\nvery fine powder, and secured in a vessel, while hot, from the sunshine.\r\nIf there seem anything remarkable in the fact of such astonishing\r\nproperties being developed by this process, it must be from our\r\nshort-sightedness, for common salt and charcoal develop powers quite as\r\nmarvellous after a certain number of thumps, stirs, and shakes, from the\r\nhands of modern workers of miracles. In fact the Unguentum Armarium and\r\nSympathetic Powder resemble some more recent prescriptions; the latter\r\nconsisting in an infinite dilution of the common dose in which remedies\r\nare given, and the two former in an infinite dilution of the common\r\ndistance at which they are applied.\r\n\r\nWhether philosophers, and more especially metaphysicians, have any\r\npeculiar tendency to dabble in drugs and dose themselves with physic,\r\nis a question which might suggest itself to the reader of their\r\nbiographies.\r\n\r\nWhen Bishop Berkeley visited the illustrious Malebranche at Paris,\r\nhe found him in his cell, cooking in a small pipkin a medicine for an\r\ninflammation of the lungs, from which he was suffering; and the disease,\r\nbeing unfortunately aggravated by the vehemence of their discussion, or\r\nthe contents of the pipkin, carried him off in the course of a few days.\r\nBerkeley himself afforded a remarkable illustration of a truth which\r\nhas long been known to the members of one of the learned professions,\r\nnamely, that no amount of talent, or of acquirements in other\r\ndepartments, can rescue from lamentable folly those who, without\r\nsomething of the requisite preparation, undertake to experiment with\r\nnostrums upon themselves and their neighbors. The exalted character of\r\nBerkeley is thus drawn by Sir James Mackintosh: Ancient learning,\r\nexact science, polished society, modern literature, and the fine arts,\r\ncontributed to adorn and enrich the mind of this accomplished man. All\r\nhis contemporaries agreed with the satirist in ascribing\r\n\r\n“'To Berkeley every virtue under heaven.'\r\n\r\n“Even the discerning, fastidious, and turbulent Atterbury said, after an\r\ninterview with him, 'So much understanding, so much knowledge, so much\r\ninnocence, and such humility, I did not think had been the portion of\r\nany but angels, till I saw this gentleman.'”\r\n\r\nBut among the writings of this great and good man is an Essay of the\r\nmost curious character, illustrating his weakness upon the point in\r\nquestion, and entitled, “Siris, a Chain of Philosophical Reflections\r\nand Inquiries concerning the Virtues of TAR WATER, and divers other\r\nSubjects,”--an essay which begins with a recipe for his favorite fluid,\r\nand slides by gentle gradations into an examination of the sublimest\r\ndoctrines of Plato. To show how far a man of honesty and benevolence,\r\nand with a mind of singular acuteness and depth, may be run away with by\r\na favorite notion on a subject which his habits and education do not fit\r\nhim to investigate, I shall give a short account of this Essay, merely\r\nstating that as all the supposed virtues of Tar Water, made public in\r\nsuccessive editions of his treatise by so illustrious an author, have\r\nnot saved it from neglect and disgrace, it may be fairly assumed that\r\nthey were mainly imaginary.\r\n\r\nThe bishop, as is usual in such cases, speaks of himself as\r\nindispensably obliged, by the duty he owes to mankind, to make his\r\nexperience public. Now this was by no means evident, nor does it follow\r\nin general, that because a man has formed a favorable opinion of\r\na person or a thing he has not the proper means of thoroughly\r\nunderstanding, he shall be bound to print it, and thus give currency\r\nto his impressions, which may be erroneous, and therefore injurious.\r\nHe would have done much better to have laid his impressions before some\r\nexperienced physicians and surgeons, such as Dr. Mead and Mr. Cheselden,\r\nto have asked them to try his experiment over again, and have been\r\nguided by their answers. But the good bishop got excited; he pleased\r\nhimself with the thought that he had discovered a great panacea; and\r\nhaving once tasted the bewitching cup of self-quackery, like many before\r\nand since his time, he was so infatuated with the draught that he would\r\ninsist on pouring it down the throats of his neighbors and all mankind.\r\n\r\nThe precious fluid was made by stirring a gallon of water with a quart\r\nof tar, leaving it forty-eight hours, and pouring off the clear water.\r\nSuch was the specific which the great metaphysician recommended for\r\naverting and curing all manner of diseases. It was, if he might be\r\nbelieved, a preventive of the small-pox, and of great use in the course\r\nof the disease. It was a cure for impurities of the blood, coughs,\r\npleurisy, peripneumony, erysipelas, asthma, indigestion, carchexia,\r\nhysterics, dropsy, mortification, scurvy, and hypochondria. It was of\r\ngreat use in gout and fevers, and was an excellent preservative of\r\nthe teeth and gums; answered all the purpose of Elixir Proprietatis,\r\nStoughton's drops, diet drinks, and mineral waters; was particularly to\r\nbe recommended to sea-faring persons, ladies, and men of studious and\r\nsedentary lives; could never be taken too long, but, on the contrary,\r\nproduced advantages which sometimes did not begin to show themselves for\r\ntwo or three months.\r\n\r\n“From my representing Tar Water as good for so many things,” says\r\nBerkeley, “some perhaps may conclude it is good for nothing. But charity\r\nobligeth me to say what I know, and what I think, however it may be\r\ntaken. Men may censure and object as they please, but I appeal to time\r\nand experiment. Effects misimputed, cases wrong told, circumstances\r\noverlooked, perhaps, too, prejudices and partialities against truth, may\r\nfor a time prevail and keep her at the bottom of her well, from whence\r\nnevertheless she emergeth sooner or later, and strikes the eyes of\r\nall who do not keep them shut.” I cannot resist the temptation of\r\nillustrating the bishop's belief in the wonderful powers of his remedy,\r\nby a few sentences from different parts of his essay. “The hardness\r\nof stubbed vulgar constitutions renders them insensible of a thousand\r\nthings that fret and gall those delicate people, who, as if their skin\r\nwas peeled off, feel to the quick everything that touches them. The\r\ntender nerves and low spirits of such poor creatures would be much\r\nrelieved by the use of Tar Water, which might prolong and cheer their\r\nlives.” “It [the Tar Water] may be made stronger for brute beasts, as\r\nhorses, in whose disorders I have found it very useful.” “This same\r\nwater will also give charitable relief to the ladies, who often want it\r\nmore than the parish poor; being many of them never able to make a good\r\nmeal, and sitting pale, puny, and forbidden, like ghosts, at their own\r\ntable, victims of vapors and indigestion.” It does not appear among the\r\nvirtues of Tar Water that “children cried for it,” as for some of our\r\nmodern remedies, but the bishop says, “I have known children take it\r\nfor above six months together with great benefit, and without any\r\ninconvenience; and after long and repeated experience I do esteem it\r\na most excellent diet drink, fitted to all seasons and ages.” After\r\nmentioning its usefulness in febrile complaints, he says: “I have had\r\nall this confirmed by my own experience in the late sickly season of the\r\nyear one thousand seven hundred and forty-one, having had twenty-five\r\nfevers in my own family cured by this medicinal water, drunk copiously.”\r\n And to finish these extracts with a most important suggestion for the\r\nimprovement of the British nation: “It is much to be lamented that our\r\nInsulars who act and think so much for themselves, should yet, from\r\ngrossness of air and diet, grow stupid or doat sooner than other people,\r\nwho, by virtue of elastic air, water-drinking, and light food, preserve\r\ntheir faculties to extreme old age; an advantage which may perhaps\r\nbe approached, if not equaled, even in these regions, by Tar Water,\r\ntemperance, and early hours.”\r\n\r\nBerkeley died at the age of about seventy; he might have lived longer,\r\nbut his fatal illness was so sudden that there was not time enough to\r\nstir up a quart of the panacea. He was an illustrious man, but he held\r\ntwo very odd opinions; that tar water was everything, and that the whole\r\nmaterial universe was nothing.\r\n\r\n                        *****\r\n\r\nMost of those present have at some time in their lives heard mention\r\nmade of the METALLIC TRACTORS, invented by one Dr. Perkins, an American,\r\nand formerly enjoying great repute for the cure of various diseases.\r\nMany have seen or heard of a satirical poem, written by one of our\r\nown countrymen also, about forty years since, and called “Terrible\r\nTractoration.” The Metallic Tractors are now so utterly abandoned that\r\nI have only by good fortune fallen upon a single one of a pair, to show\r\nfor the sake of illustration. For more than thirty years this great\r\ndiscovery, which was to banish at least half the evils which afflict\r\nhumanity, has been sleeping undisturbed in the grave of oblivion. Not a\r\nvoice has, for this long period, been raised in its favor; its noble and\r\nlearned patrons, its public institutions, its eloquent advocates, its\r\nbrilliant promises are all covered with the dust of silent neglect;\r\nand of the generation which has sprung up since the period when it\r\nflourished, very few know anything of its history, and hardly even\r\nthe title which in its palmy days it bore of PERKINISM. Taking it as\r\nsettled, then, as no one appears to answer for it, that Perkinism is\r\nentirely dead and gone, that both in public and private, officially\r\nand individually, its former adherents even allow it to be absolutely\r\ndefunct, I select it for anatomical examination. If this pretended\r\ndiscovery was made public; if it was long kept before the public; if it\r\nwas addressed to the people of different countries; if it was formally\r\ninvestigated by scientific men, and systematically adopted by benevolent\r\npersons, who did everything in their power to diffuse the knowledge\r\nand practice of it; if various collateral motives, such as interest\r\nand vanity, were embarked in its cause; if, notwithstanding all these\r\nthings, it gradually sickened and died, then the conclusion seems a fair\r\none, that it did not deserve to live. Contrasting its failure with\r\nits high pretensions, it is fair to call it an imposition; whether\r\nan expressly fraudulent contrivance or not, some might be ready to\r\nquestion. Everything historically shown to have happened concerning the\r\nmode of promulgation, the wide diffusion, the apparent success of this\r\ndelusion, the respectability and enthusiasm of its advocates, is\r\nof great interest in showing to what extent and by what means a\r\nconsiderable part of the community may be led into the belief of that\r\nwhich is to be eventually considered as an idle folly. If there is any\r\nexisting folly, fraudulent or innocent in its origin, which appeals to\r\ncertain arguments for its support; provided that the very same arguments\r\ncan be shown to have been used for Perkinism with as good reason, they\r\nwill at once fall to the ground. Still more, if it shall appear that the\r\ngeneral course of any existing delusion bears a strong resemblance to\r\nthat of Perkinism, that the former is most frequently advocated by the\r\nsame class of persons who were conspicuous in behalf of the latter, and\r\ntreated with contempt or opposed by the same kind of persons who thus\r\ntreated Perkinism; if the facts in favor of both have a similar aspect;\r\nif the motives of their originators and propagators may be presumed\r\nto have been similar; then there is every reason to suppose that the\r\nexisting folly will follow in the footsteps of the past, and after\r\ndisplaying a given amount of cunning and credulity in those deceiving\r\nand deceived, will drop from the public view like a fruit which has\r\nripened into spontaneous rottenness, and be succeeded by the fresh bloom\r\nof some other delusion required by the same excitable portion of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nDr. Elisha Perkins was born at Norwich, Connecticut, in the year 1740.\r\nHe had practised his profession with a good local reputation for many\r\nyears, when he fell upon a course of experiments, as it is related,\r\nwhich led to his great discovery. He conceived the idea that metallic\r\nsubstances might have the effect of removing diseases, if applied in\r\na certain manner; a notion probably suggested by the then recent\r\nexperiments of Galvani, in which muscular contractions were found to be\r\nproduced by the contact of two metals with the living fibre. It was in\r\n1796 that his discovery was promulgated in the shape of the Metallic\r\nTractors, two pieces of metal, one apparently iron and the other brass,\r\nabout three inches long, blunt at one end and pointed at the other.\r\nThese instruments were applied for the cure of different complaints,\r\nsuch as rheumatism, local pains, inflammations, and even tumors, by\r\ndrawing them over the affected part very lightly for about twenty\r\nminutes. Dr. Perkins took out a patent for his discovery, and travelled\r\nabout the country to diffuse the new practice. He soon found numerous\r\nadvocates of his discovery, many of them of high standing and influence.\r\nIn the year 1798 the tractors had crossed the Atlantic, and were\r\npublicly employed in the Royal Hospital at Copenhagen. About the same\r\ntime the son of the inventor, Mr. Benjamin Douglass Perkins, carried\r\nthem to London, where they soon attracted attention. The Danish\r\nphysicians published an account of their cases, containing numerous\r\ninstances of alleged success, in a respectable octavo volume. In the\r\nyear 1804 an establishment, honored with the name of the Perkinean\r\nInstitution, was founded in London. The transactions of this institution\r\nwere published in pamphlets, the Perkinean Society had public dinners\r\nat the Crown and Anchor, and a poet celebrated their medical triumph in\r\nstrains like these:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “See, pointed metals, blest with power t' appease\r\n   The ruthless rage of merciless disease,\r\n   O'er the frail part a subtle fluid pour,\r\n   Drenched with invisible Galvanic shower,\r\n   Till the arthritic staff and crutch forego,\r\n   And leap exulting like the bounding roe!”\r\n\r\nWhile all these things were going on, Mr. Benjamin Douglass Perkins was\r\ncalmly pocketing money, so that after some half a dozen years he left\r\nthe country with more than ten thousand pounds, which had been paid him\r\nby the believers in Great Britain. But in spite of all this success, and\r\nthe number of those interested and committed in its behalf, Perkinism\r\nsoon began to decline, and in 1811 the Tractors are spoken of by an\r\nintelligent writer as being almost forgotten. Such was the origin and\r\nduration of this doctrine and practice, into the history of which we\r\nwill now look a little more narrowly.\r\n\r\nLet us see, then, by whose agency this delusion was established and kept\r\nup; whether it was principally by those who were accustomed to medical\r\npursuits, or those whose habits and modes of reasoning were different;\r\nwhether it was with the approbation of those learned bodies usually\r\nsupposed to take an interest in scientific discoveries, or only of\r\nindividuals whose claims to distinction were founded upon their position\r\nin society, or political station, or literary eminence; whether the\r\njudicious or excitable classes entered most deeply into it; whether, in\r\nshort, the scientific men of that time were deceived, or only intruded\r\nupon, and shouted down for the moment by persons who had no particular\r\ncall to invade their precincts.\r\n\r\nNot much, perhaps, was to be expected of the Medical Profession in the\r\nway of encouragement. One Dr. Fuller, who wrote in England, himself\r\na Perkinist, thus expressed his opinion: “It must be an extraordinary\r\nexertion of virtue and humanity for a medical man, whose livelihood\r\ndepends either on the sale of drugs, or on receiving a guinea for\r\nwriting a prescription, which must relate to those drugs, to say to\r\nhis patient, 'You had better purchase a set of Tractors to keep in your\r\nfamily; they will cure you without the expense of my attendance, or the\r\ndanger of the common medical practice.' For very obvious reasons medical\r\nmen must never be expected to recommend the use of Perkinism. The\r\nTractors must trust for their patronage to the enlightened and\r\nphilanthropic out of the profession, or to medical men retired from\r\npractice, and who know of no other interest than the luxury of relieving\r\nthe distressed. And I do not despair of seeing the day when but very few\r\nof this description as well as private families will be without them.”\r\n\r\nWhether the motives assigned by this medical man to his professional\r\nbrethren existed or not, it is true that Dr. Perkins did not gain a\r\ngreat deal at their hands. The Connecticut Medical Society expelled him\r\nin 1797 for violating their law against the use of nostrums, or secret\r\nremedies. The leading English physicians appear to have looked on with\r\nsingular apathy or contempt at the miracles which it was pretended were\r\nenacting in the hands of the apostles of the new practice. In looking\r\nover the reviews of the time, I have found little beyond brief\r\noccasional notices of their pretensions; the columns of these journals\r\nbeing occupied with subjects of more permanent interest. The state of\r\nthings in London is best learned, however, from the satirical poem\r\nto which I have already alluded as having been written at the period\r\nreferred to. This was entitled, “Terrible Tractoration!! A Poetical\r\nPetition against Galvanizing Trumpery and the Perkinistic Institution.\r\nMost respectfully addressed to the Royal College of Physicians, by\r\nChristopher Caustic, M. D., LL. D., A. S. S., Fellow of the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians, Aberdeen, and Honorary Member of no less than\r\nnineteen very learned Societies.” Two editions of this work were\r\npublished in London in the years 1803 and 1804, and one or two have been\r\npublished in this country.\r\n\r\n“Terrible Tractoration” is supposed, by those who never read it, to be\r\na satire upon the follies of Perkins and his followers. It is, on the\r\ncontrary, a most zealous defence of Perkinism, and a fierce attack upon\r\nits opponents, most especially upon such of the medical profession\r\nas treated the subject with neglect or ridicule. The Royal College of\r\nPhysicians was the more peculiar object of the attack, but with this\r\nbody, the editors of some of the leading periodicals, and several\r\nphysicians distinguished at that time, and even now remembered for\r\ntheir services to science and humanity, were involved in unsparing\r\ndenunciations. The work is by no means of the simply humorous character\r\nit might be supposed, but is overloaded with notes of the most seriously\r\npolemical nature. Much of the history of the subject, indeed, is to be\r\nlooked for in this volume.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this work that the principal members of the medical\r\nprofession, so far from hailing Mr. Benjamin Douglass Perkins as another\r\nHarvey or Jenner, looked very coldly upon him and his Tractors; and it\r\nis now evident that, though they were much abused for so doing, they\r\nknew very well what they had to deal with, and were altogether in the\r\nright. The delusion at last attracted such an amount of attention as to\r\ninduce Dr. Haygarth and some others of respectable standing to institute\r\nsome experiments which I shall mention in their proper place, the result\r\nof which might have seemed sufficient to show the emptiness of the whole\r\ncontrivance.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society, that learned body which for ages has constituted\r\nthe best tribunal to which Britain can appeal in questions of science,\r\naccepted Mr. Perkins's Tractors and the book written about them, passed\r\nthe customary vote of thanks, and never thought of troubling itself\r\nfurther in the investigation of pretensions of such an aspect. It is\r\nnot to be denied that a considerable number of physicians did avow\r\nthemselves advocates of the new practice; but out of the whole catalogue\r\nof those who were publicly proclaimed as such, no one has ever been\r\nknown, so far as I am aware, to the scientific world, except in\r\nconnection with the short-lived notoriety of Perkinism. Who were\r\nthe people, then, to whose activity, influence, or standing with\r\nthe community was owing all the temporary excitement produced by the\r\nMetallic Tractors?\r\n\r\nFirst, those persons who had been induced to purchase a pair of\r\nTractors. These little bits of brass and iron, the intrinsic value of\r\nwhich might, perhaps, amount to ninepence, were sold at five guineas a\r\npair! A man who has paid twenty-five dollars for his whistle is apt to\r\nblow it louder and longer than other people. So it appeared that when\r\nthe “Perkinean Society” applied to the possessors of Tractors in the\r\nmetropolis to concur in the establishment of a public institution for\r\nthe use of these instruments upon the poor, “it was found that only five\r\nout of above a hundred objected to subscribe, on account of their want\r\nof confidence in the efficacy of the practice; and these,” the committee\r\nobserves, “there is reason to believe, never gave them a fair trial,\r\nprobably never used them in more than one case, and that perhaps a\r\ncase in which the Tractors had never been recommended as serviceable.”\r\n “Purchasers of the Tractors,” said one of their ardent advocates, “would\r\nbe among the last to approve of them if they had reason to suppose\r\nthemselves defrauded of five guineas.” He forgot poor Moses, with his\r\n“gross of green spectacles, with silver rims and shagreen cases.” “Dear\r\nmother,” cried the boy, “why won't you listen to reason? I had them a\r\ndead bargain, or I should not have bought them. The silver rims alone\r\nwill sell for double the money.”\r\n\r\nBut it is an undeniable fact, that many persons of considerable\r\nstanding, and in some instances holding the most elevated positions in\r\nsociety, openly patronized the new practice. In a translation of a work\r\nentitled “Experiments with the Metallic Tractors,” originally published\r\nin Danish, thence rendered successively into German and English, Mr.\r\nBenjamin Perkins, who edited the English edition, has given a copious\r\nenumeration of the distinguished individuals, both in America and\r\nEurope, whose patronage he enjoyed. He goes so far as to signify that\r\nROYALTY itself was to be included among the number. When the Perkinean\r\nInstitution was founded, no less a person than Lord Rivers was elected\r\nPresident, and eleven other individuals of distinction, among them\r\nGovernor Franklin, son of Dr. Franklin, figured as Vice-Presidents. Lord\r\nHenniker, a member of the Royal Society, who is spoken of as a man\r\nof judgment and talents, condescended to patronize the astonishing\r\ndiscovery, and at different times bought three pairs of Tractors. When\r\nthe Tractors were introduced into Europe, a large number of testimonials\r\naccompanied them from various distinguished characters in America, the\r\nlist of whom is given in the translation of the Danish work referred to\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“Those who have individually stated cases, or who have presented their\r\nnames to the public as men who approved of this remedy, and acknowledged\r\nthemselves instrumental in circulating the Tractors, are fifty-six in\r\nnumber; thirty-four of whom are physicians and surgeons, and many of\r\nthem of the first eminence, thirteen clergymen, most of whom are doctors\r\nof divinity, and connected with the literary institutions of America;\r\namong the remainder are two members of Congress, one professor of\r\nnatural philosophy in a college, etc., etc.” It seemed to be taken\r\nrather hardly by Mr. Perkins that the translators of the work which he\r\nedited, in citing the names of the advocates of the Metallic Practice,\r\nfrequently omitted the honorary titles which should have been annexed.\r\nThe testimonials were obtained by the Danish writer, from a pamphlet\r\npublished in America, in which these titles were given in full. Thus\r\none of these testimonials is from “John Tyler, Esq., a magistrate in the\r\ncounty of New London, and late Brigadier-General of the militia in\r\nthat State.” The “omission of the General's title” is the subject of\r\ncomplaint, as if this title were sufficient evidence of the commanding\r\npowers of one of the patrons of tractoration. A similar complaint is\r\nmade when “Calvin Goddard, Esq., of Plainfield, Attorney at Law, and\r\na member of the Legislature of the State of Connecticut,” is mentioned\r\nwithout his titular honors, and even on account of the omission of the\r\nproper official titles belonging to “Nathan Pierce, Esq., Governor and\r\nManager of the Almshouse of Newburyport.” These instances show the great\r\nimportance to be attached to civil and military dignities, in qualifying\r\ntheir holders to judge of scientific subjects, a truth which has not\r\nbeen overlooked by the legitimate successors of the Perkinists. In Great\r\nBritain, the Tractors were not less honored than in America, by the\r\nlearned and the illustrious. The “Perkinistic Committee” made this\r\nstatement in their report: “Mr. Perkins has annually laid before the\r\npublic a large collection of new cases communicated to him for that\r\npurpose by disinterested and intelligent characters, from almost every\r\nquarter of Great Britain. In regard to the competency of these vouchers,\r\nit will be sufficient simply to state that, amongst others whose names\r\nhave been attached to their communications, are eight professors, in\r\nfour different universities, twenty-one regular Physicians, nineteen\r\nSurgeons, thirty Clergymen, twelve of whom are Doctors of Divinity, and\r\nnumerous other characters of equal respectability.”\r\n\r\nIt cannot but excite our notice and surprise that the number of\r\nclergymen both in America and Great Britain who thrust forward their\r\nevidence on this medical topic was singularly large in proportion\r\nto that of the members of the medical profession. Whole pages are\r\ncontributed by such worthies as the Rev. Dr. Trotter of Hans Place,\r\nthe Rear. Waring Willett, Chaplain to the Earl of Dunmore, the Rev.\r\nDr. Clarke, Chaplain to the Prince of Wales. The style of these\r\ntheologico-medical communications may be seen in the following from a\r\ndivine who was also professor in one of the colleges of New England.\r\n“I have used the Tractors with success in several other cases in my\r\nown family, and although, like Naaman the Syrian, I cannot tell why\r\nthe waters of Jordan should be better than Abana and Pharpar, rivers\r\nof Damascus; yet since experience has proved them so, no reasoning\r\ncan change the opinion. Indeed, the causes of all common facts are, we\r\nthink, perfectly well known to us; and it is very probable, fifty or\r\na hundred years hence, we shall as well know why the Metallic Tractors\r\nshould in a few minutes remove violent pains, as we now know why\r\ncantharides and opium will produce opposite effects, namely, we shall\r\nknow very little about either excepting facts.” Fifty or a hundred years\r\nhence! if he could have looked forward forty years, he would have\r\nseen the descendants of the “Perkinistic” philosophers swallowing\r\ninfinitesimal globules, and knowing and caring as much about the\r\nTractors as the people at Saratoga Springs do about the waters of Abana\r\nand Pharpar.\r\n\r\nI trust it will not be thought in any degree disrespectful to a\r\nprofession which we all honor, that I have mentioned the great zeal\r\nof many clergymen in the cause of Perkinism. I hope, too, that I may\r\nwithout offence suggest the causes which have often led them out of\r\ntheir own province into one to which their education has no special\r\nreference. The members of that profession ought to be, and commonly are,\r\npersons of benevolent character. Their duties carry them into the midst\r\nof families, and particularly at times when the members of them are\r\nsuffering from bodily illness. It is natural enough that a strong desire\r\nshould be excited to alleviate sufferings which may have defied\r\nthe efforts of professional skill; as natural that any remedy which\r\nrecommends itself to the belief or the fancy of the spiritual physician\r\nshould be applied with the hope of benefit; and perfectly certain that\r\nthe weakness of human nature, from which no profession is exempt,\r\nwill lead him to take the most flattering view of its effects upon the\r\npatient; his own sagacity and judgment being staked upon the success of\r\nthe trial. The inventor of the Tractors was aware of these truths. He\r\ntherefore sent the Tractors gratuitously to many clergymen, accompanied\r\nwith a formal certificate that the holder had become entitled to their\r\npossession by the payment of five guineas. This was practised in our\r\nown neighborhood, and I remember finding one of these certificates,\r\nso presented, which proved that amongst the risks of infancy I had to\r\nencounter Perkins's Tractors. Two clergymen of Boston and the vicinity,\r\nboth well known to local fame, gave in their testimony to the value\r\nof the instruments thus presented to them; an unusually moderate\r\nproportion, when it is remembered that to the common motives of which\r\nI have spoken was added the seduction of a gift for which the profane\r\npublic was expected to pay so largely.\r\n\r\nIt was remarkable, also, that Perkinism, which had so little success\r\nwith the medical and scientific part of the community, found great favor\r\nin the eyes of its more lovely and less obstinate portion. “The lady of\r\nMajor Oxholin,”--I quote from Mr. Perkins's volume,--“having been lately\r\nin America, had seen and heard much of the great effects of Perkinism.\r\nInfluenced by a most benevolent disposition, she brought these Tractors\r\nand the pamphlet with her to Europe, with a laudable desire of extending\r\ntheir utility to her suffering countrymen.” Such was the channel by\r\nwhich the Tractors were conveyed to Denmark, where they soon became the\r\nruling passion. The workmen, says a French writer, could not manufacture\r\nthem fast enough. Women carried them about their persons, and delighted\r\nin bringing them into general use. To what extent the Tractors were\r\nfavored with the patronage of English and American ladies, it is of\r\ncourse not easy to say, except on general principles, as their names\r\nwere not brought before the public. But one of Dr. Haygarth's stories\r\nmay lead us to conjecture that there was a class of female practitioners\r\nwho went about doing good with the Tractors in England as well as in\r\nDenmark. A certain lady had the misfortune to have a spot as big as a\r\nsilver penny at the corner of her eye, caused by a bruise, or some such\r\ninjury. Another lady, who was a friend of hers, and a strong believer in\r\nPerkinism, was very anxious to try the effects of tractoration upon\r\nthis unfortunate blemish. The patient consented; the lady “produced the\r\ninstruments, and, after drawing them four or five times over the spot,\r\ndeclared that it changed to a paler color, and on repeating the use of\r\nthem a few minutes longer, that it had almost vanished, and was scarcely\r\nvisible, and departed in high triumph at her success.” The lady who\r\nunderwent the operation assured the narrator “that she looked in the\r\nglass immediately after, and that not the least visible alteration had\r\ntaken place.”\r\n\r\nIt would be a very interesting question, what was the intellectual\r\ncharacter of those persons most conspicuous in behalf of the Perkinistic\r\ndelusion? Such an inquiry might bring to light some principles which\r\nwe could hereafter apply to the study of other popular errors. But the\r\nobscurity into which nearly all these enthusiasts have subsided renders\r\nthe question easier to ask than to answer. I believe it would have\r\nbeen found that most of these persons were of ardent temperament and\r\nof considerable imagination, and that their history would show\r\nthat Perkinism was not the first nor the last hobby-horse they rode\r\nfuriously. Many of them may very probably have been persons of more than\r\ncommon talent, of active and ingenious minds, of versatile powers and\r\nvarious acquirements. Such, for instance, was the estimable man to whom\r\nI have repeatedly referred as a warm defender of tractoration, and\r\na bitter assailant of its enemies. The story tells itself in the\r\nbiographical preface to his poem. He went to London with the view\r\nof introducing a hydraulic machine, which he and his Vermont friends\r\nregarded as a very important invention. He found, however, that the\r\nmachine was already in common use in that metropolis. A brother Yankee,\r\nthen in London, had started the project of a mill, which was to be\r\ncarried by the water of the Thames. He was sanguine enough to purchase\r\none fifth of this concern, which also proved a failure. At about the\r\nsame period he wrote the work which proved the great excitement of his\r\nmind upon the subject of the transient folly then before the public.\r\nOriginally a lawyer, he was in succession a mechanician, a poet, and an\r\neditor, meeting with far less success in each of these departments\r\nthan usually attends men of less varied gifts, but of more tranquil and\r\nphlegmatic composition. But who is ignorant that there is a class of\r\nminds characterized by qualities like those I have mentioned; minds with\r\nmany bright and even beautiful traits; but aimless and fickle as the\r\nbutterfly; that settle upon every gayly-colored illusion as it opens\r\ninto flower, and flutter away to another when the first has dropped its\r\nleaves, and stands naked in the icy air of truth!\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the general tenor of the arguments addressed by\r\nbelievers to sceptics and opponents. Foremost of all, emblazoned at the\r\nhead of every column, loudest shouted by every triumphant disputant,\r\nheld up as paramount to all other considerations, stretched like an\r\nimpenetrable shield to protect the weakest advocate of the great cause\r\nagainst the weapons of the adversary, was that omnipotent monosyllable\r\nwhich has been the patrimony of cheats and the currency of dupes from\r\ntime immemorial,--Facts! Facts! Facts! First came the published cases\r\nof the American clergymen, brigadier-generals, almshouse governors,\r\nrepresentatives, attorneys, and esquires. Then came the published\r\ncases of the surgeons of Copenhagen. Then followed reports of about\r\none hundred and fifty cases published in England, “demonstrating the\r\nefficacy of the metallic practice in a variety of complaints both upon\r\nthe human body and on horses, etc.” But the progress of facts in Great\r\nBritain did not stop here. Let those who rely upon the numbers of their\r\ntestimonials, as being alone sufficient to prove the soundness and\r\nstability of a medical novelty, digest the following from the report\r\nof the Perkinistic Committee. “The cases published [in Great Britain]\r\namounted, in March last, the date of Mr. Perkins's last publication,\r\nto about five thousand. Supposing that not more than one cure in three\r\nhundred which the Tractors have performed has been published, and the\r\nproportion is probably much greater, it will be seen that the number, to\r\nMarch last, will have exceeded one million five hundred thousand!”\r\n\r\nNext in order after the appeal to what were called facts, came a series\r\nof arguments, which have been so long bruised and battered round in the\r\ncause of every doctrine or pretension, new, monstrous, or deliriously\r\nimpossible, that each of them is as odiously familiar to the scientific\r\nscholar as the faces of so many old acquaintances, among the less\r\nreputable classes, to the officers of police.\r\n\r\nNo doubt many of my hearers will recognize, in the following passages,\r\narguments they may have heard brought forward with triumphant confidence\r\nin behalf of some doctrine not yet extinct. No doubt some may have\r\nhonestly thought they proved something; may have used them with the\r\npurpose of convincing their friends, or of silencing the opponents\r\nof their favorite doctrine, whatever that might be. But any train\r\nof arguments which was contrived for Perkinism, which was just as\r\napplicable to it as to any other new doctrine in the same branch of\r\nscience, and which was fully employed against its adversaries forty\r\nyears since, might, in common charity, be suffered to slumber in the\r\ngrave of Perkinism. Whether or not the following sentences, taken\r\nliterally from the work of Mr. Perkins, were the originals of some of\r\nthe idle propositions we hear bandied about from time to time, let those\r\nwho listen judge.\r\n\r\nThe following is the test assumed for the new practice: “If diseases are\r\nreally removed, as those persons who have practised extensively with\r\nthe Tractors declare, it should seem there would be but little doubt\r\nof their being generally adopted; but if the numerous reports of their\r\nefficacy which have been published are forgeries, or are unfounded,\r\nthe practice ought to be crushed.” To this I merely add, it has been\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\nThe following sentence applies to that a priori judging and uncandid\r\nclass of individuals who buy their dinners without tasting all the\r\nfood there is in the market. “On all discoveries there are persons who,\r\nwithout descending to any inquiry into the truth, pretend to know, as it\r\nwere by intuition, that newly asserted facts are founded in the\r\ngrossest errors. These were those who knew that Harvey's report of the\r\ncirculation of the blood was a preposterous and ridiculous suggestion,\r\nand in latter later days there were others who knew that Franklin\r\ndeserved reproach for declaring that points were preferable to balls for\r\nprotecting buildings from lightning.”\r\n\r\nAgain: “This unwarrantable mode of offering assertion for proof, so\r\nunauthorized and even unprecedented except in the condemnation of\r\na Galileo, the persecution of a Copernicus, and a few other acts of\r\ninquisitorial authority, in the times of ignorance and superstition,\r\naffords but a lamentable instance of one of his remarks, that this is\r\nfar from being the Age of Reason.”\r\n\r\n“The most valuable medicines in the Materia Medica act on principles of\r\nwhich we are totally ignorant. None have ever yet been able to explain\r\nhow opium produces sleep, or how bark cures intermittent fevers; and yet\r\nfew, it is hoped, will be so absurd as to desist from the use of these\r\nimportant articles because they know nothing of the principle of their\r\noperations.” Or if the argument is preferred, in the eloquent language\r\nof the Perkinistic poet:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “What though the CAUSES may not be explained,\r\n   Since these EFFECTS are duly ascertained,\r\n   Let not self-interest, prejudice, or pride,\r\n   Induce mankind to set the means aside;\r\n   Means which, though simple, are by\r\n   Heaven designed to alleviate the woes of human kind.”\r\n\r\nThis course of argument is so often employed, that it deserves to be\r\nexpanded a little, so that its length and breadth may be fairly seen.\r\nA series of what are called facts is brought forward to prove some very\r\nimprobable doctrine. It is objected by judicious people, or such as have\r\ndevoted themselves to analogous subjects, that these assumed facts are\r\nin direct opposition to all that is known of the course of nature, that\r\nthe universal experience of the past affords a powerful presumption\r\nagainst their truth, and that in proportion to the gravity of these\r\nobjections, should be the number and competence of the witnesses. The\r\nanswer is a ready one. What do we know of the mysteries of Nature? Do\r\nwe understand the intricate machinery of the Universe? When to this is\r\nadded the never-failing quotation,\r\n\r\n\r\n  “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\r\n   Than are dreamt of in your philosophy,”--\r\n\r\nthe question is thought to be finally disposed of.\r\n\r\nTake the case of astrology as an example. It is in itself strange and\r\nincredible that the relations of the heavenly bodies to each other at a\r\ngiven moment of time, perhaps half a century ago, should have anything\r\nto do with my success or misfortune in any undertaking of to-day.\r\nBut what right have I to say it cannot be so? Can I bind the sweet\r\ninfluences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? I do not know by\r\nwhat mighty magic the planets roll in their fluid paths, confined to\r\ncircles as unchanging as if they were rings of steel, nor why the great\r\nwave of ocean follows in a sleepless round upon the skirts of moonlight;\r\nnor can I say from any certain knowledge that the phases of the heavenly\r\nbodies, or even the falling of the leaves of the forest, or the manner\r\nin which the sands lie upon the sea-shore, may not be knit up by\r\ninvisible threads with the web of human destiny. There is a class\r\nof minds much more ready to believe that which is at first sight\r\nincredible, and because it is incredible, than what is generally thought\r\nreasonable. Credo quia impossibile est,--“I believe, because it is\r\nimpossible,”--is an old paradoxical expression which might be literally\r\napplied to this tribe of persons. And they always succeed in finding\r\nsomething marvellous, to call out the exercise of their robust faith.\r\nThe old Cabalistic teachers maintained that there was not a verse,\r\nline, word, or even letter in the Bible which had not a special efficacy\r\neither to defend the person who rightly employed it, or to injure his\r\nenemies; always provided the original Hebrew was made use of. In the\r\nhands of modern Cabalists every substance, no matter how inert, acquires\r\nwonderful medicinal virtues, provided it be used in a proper state of\r\npurity and subdivision.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the motives attributed by the Perkinists to the\r\nMedical Profession, as preventing its members from receiving the new\r\nbut unwelcome truths. This accusation is repeated in different forms and\r\nplaces, as, for instance, in the following passage: “Will the medical\r\nman who has spent much money and labor in the pursuit of the arcana\r\nof Physic, and on the exercise of which depends his support in life,\r\nproclaim the inefficacy of his art, and recommend a remedy to\r\nhis patient which the most unlettered in society can employ as\r\nadvantageously as himself? and a remedy, too, which, unlike the drops,\r\nthe pills, the powders, etc., of the Materia Medica, is inconsumable,\r\nand ever in readiness to be employed in successive diseases?”\r\n\r\nAs usual with these people, much indignation was expressed at any\r\nparallel between their particular doctrine and practice and those of\r\ntheir exploded predecessors. “The motives,” says the disinterested\r\nMr. Perkins, “which must have impelled to this attempt at classing the\r\nMETALLIC PRACTICE with the most paltry of empyrical projects, are but\r\ntoo thinly veiled to escape detection.”\r\n\r\nTo all these arguments was added, as a matter of course, an appeal to\r\nthe feelings of the benevolent in behalf of suffering humanity, in the\r\nshape of a notice that the poor would be treated gratis. It is pretty\r\nwell understood that this gratuitous treatment of the poor does not\r\nnecessarily imply an excess of benevolence, any more than the gratuitous\r\ndistribution of a trader's shop-bills is an evidence of remarkable\r\ngenerosity; in short, that it is one of those things which honest men\r\noften do from the best motives, but which rogues and impostors never\r\nfail to announce as one of their special recommendations. It is\r\nastonishing to see how these things brighten up at the touch of Mr.\r\nPerkins's poet:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Ye worthy, honored, philanthropic few,\r\n   The muse shall weave her brightest wreaths for you,\r\n   Who in Humanity's bland cause unite,\r\n   Nor heed the shaft by interest aimed or spite;\r\n   Like the great Pattern of Benevolence,\r\n   Hygeia's blessings to the poor dispense;\r\n   And though opposed by folly's servile brood,\r\n   ENJOY THE LUXURY OF DOING GOOD.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus sketched the history of Perkinism in its days of prosperity;\r\nhaving seen how it sprung into being, and by what means it maintained\r\nits influence, it only remains to tell the brief story of its\r\ndiscomfiture and final downfall. The vast majority of the sensible part\r\nof the medical profession were contented, so far as we can judge, to\r\nlet it die out of itself. It was in vain that the advocates of this\r\ninvaluable discovery exclaimed over their perverse and interested\r\nobstinacy,--in vain that they called up the injured ghosts of Harvey,\r\nGalileo, and Copernicus to shame that unbelieving generation; the\r\nBaillies and the Heberdens,--men whose names have come down to us\r\nas synonymous with honor and wisdom,--bore their reproaches in meek\r\nsilence, and left them unanswered to their fate. There were some others,\r\nhowever, who, believing the public to labor under a delusion, thought it\r\nworth while to see whether the charm would be broken by an open trial of\r\nits virtue, as compared with that of some less hallowed formula. It\r\nmust be remembered that a peculiar value was attached to the Metallic\r\nTractors, as made and patented by Mr. Perkins. Dr. Haygarth, of Bath,\r\nperformed various experiments upon patients afflicted with different\r\ncomplaints,--the patients supposing that the real five-guinea Tractors\r\nwere employed. Strange to relate, he obtained equally wonderful effects\r\nwith Tractors of lead and of wood; with nails, pieces of bone, slate\r\npencil, and tobacco-pipe. Dr. Alderson employed sham Tractors made of\r\nwood, and produced such effects upon five patients that they returned\r\nsolemn thanks in church for their cures. A single specimen of these\r\ncases may stand for all of them. Ann Hill had suffered for some months\r\nfrom pain in the right arm and shoulder. The Tractors (wooden ones) were\r\napplied, and in the space of five minutes she expressed herself relieved\r\nin the following apostrophe: “Bless me! why, who could have thought it,\r\nthat them little things could pull the pain from one. Well, to be sure,\r\nthe longer one lives, the more one sees; ah, dear!”\r\n\r\nThese experiments did not result in the immediate extinction of\r\nPerkinism. Doubtless they were a great comfort to many obstinate\r\nunbelievers, and helped to settle some sceptical minds; but for the real\r\nPerkinistic enthusiasts, it may be questioned whether they would at that\r\ntime have changed their opinion though one had risen from the dead to\r\nassure them that it was an error. It perished without violence, by an\r\neasy and natural process. Like the famous toy of Mongolfier, it rose by\r\nmeans of heated air,--the fevered breath of enthusiastic ignorance,--and\r\nwhen this grew cool, as it always does in a little while, it collapsed\r\nand fell.\r\n\r\nAnd now, on reviewing the whole subject, how shall we account for the\r\nextraordinary prevalence of the belief in Perkinism among a portion of\r\nwhat is supposed to be the thinking part of the community?\r\n\r\nCould the cures have been real ones, produced by the principle of ANIMAL\r\nMAGNETISM? To this it may be answered that the Perkinists ridiculed the\r\nidea of approximating Mesmer and the founder of their own doctrine, that\r\nnothing like the somnambulic condition seems to have followed the use of\r\nthe Tractors, and that neither the exertion of the will nor the powers\r\nof the individual who operated seem to have been considered of any\r\nconsequence. Besides, the absolute neglect into which the Tractors soon\r\ndeclined is good evidence that they were incapable of affording any\r\nconsiderable and permanent relief in the complaints for the cure of\r\nwhich they were applied.\r\n\r\nOf course a large number of apparent cures were due solely to nature;\r\nwhich is true under every form of treatment, orthodox or empirical.\r\nOf course many persons experienced at least temporary relief from the\r\nstrong impression made upon their minds by this novel and marvellous\r\nmethod of treatment.\r\n\r\nMany, again, influenced by the sanguine hopes of those about them, like\r\ndying people, who often say sincerely, from day to day, that they are\r\ngetting better, cheated themselves into a false and short-lived belief\r\nthat they were cured; and as happens in such cases, the public never\r\nknew more than the first half of the story.\r\n\r\nWhen it was said to the Perkinists, that whatever effects they produced\r\nwere merely through the imagination, they declared (like the advocates\r\nof the ROYAL TOUCH and the UNGUENTUM ARMARIUM) that this explanation\r\nwas sufficiently disproved by the fact of numerous and successful cures\r\nwhich had been witnessed in infants and brute animals. Dr. Haygarth\r\nreplied to this, that “in these cases it is not the Patient, but the\r\nObserver, who is deceived by his own imagination,” and that such may be\r\nthe fact, we have seen in the case of the good lady who thought she had\r\nconjured away the spot from her friend's countenance, when it remained\r\njust as before.\r\n\r\nAs to the motives of the inventor and vender of the Tractors, the facts\r\nmust be allowed to speak for themselves. But when two little bits of\r\nbrass and iron are patented, as an invention, as the result of numerous\r\nexperiments, when people are led, or even allowed, to infer that they\r\nare a peculiar compound, when they are artfully associated with a new\r\nand brilliant discovery (which then happened to be Galvanism), when they\r\nare sold at many hundred times their value, and the seller prints his\r\nopinion that a Hospital will suffer inconvenience, “unless it possesses\r\nmany sets of the Tractors, and these placed in the hands of the patients\r\nto practise on each other,” one cannot but suspect that they were\r\ncontrived in the neighborhood of a wooden nutmeg factory; that legs of\r\nham in that region are not made of the best mahogany; and that such as\r\nbuy their cucumber seed in that vicinity have to wait for the fruit as\r\nlong as the Indians for their crop of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n                         *****\r\n\r\nThe succeeding lecture will be devoted to an examination of the\r\ndoctrines of Samuel Hahnemann and his disciples; doctrines which some\r\nconsider new and others old; the common title of which is variously\r\nknown as Ho-moeopathy, Homoe-op-athy, Homoeo-paith-y, or Hom'pathy, and\r\nthe claims of which are considered by some as infinitely important, and\r\nby many as immeasurably ridiculous.\r\n\r\nI wish to state, for the sake of any who may be interested in the\r\nsubject, that I shall treat it, not by ridicule, but by argument;\r\nperhaps with great freedom, but with good temper and in peaceable\r\nlanguage; with very little hope of reclaiming converts, with no desire\r\nof making enemies, but with a firm belief that its pretensions and\r\nassertions cannot stand before a single hour of calm investigation.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that a direct attack upon the pretensions of\r\nHOMOEOPATHY is an uncalled-for aggression upon an unoffending doctrine\r\nand its peaceful advocates.\r\n\r\nBut a little inquiry will show that it has long assumed so hostile a\r\nposition with respect to the Medical Profession, that any trouble I, or\r\nany other member of that profession, may choose to bestow upon it may be\r\nconsidered merely as a matter of self-defence. It began with an attempt\r\nto show the insignificance of all existing medical knowledge. It not\r\nonly laid claim to wonderful powers of its own, but it declared the\r\ncommon practice to be attended with the most positively injurious\r\neffects, that by it acute diseases are aggravated, and chronic diseases\r\nrendered incurable. It has at various times brought forward collections\r\nof figures having the air of statistical documents, pretending to show\r\na great proportional mortality among the patients of the Medical\r\nProfession, as compared with those treated according to its own rules.\r\nNot contented with choosing a name of classical origin for itself, it\r\ninvented one for the whole community of innocent physicians, assuring\r\nthem, to their great surprise, that they were all ALLOPATHISTS, whether\r\nthey knew it or not, and including all the illustrious masters of the\r\npast, from Hippocrates down to Hunter, under the same gratuitous title.\r\nThe line, then, has been drawn by the champions of the new doctrine;\r\nthey have lifted the lance, they have sounded the charge, and are\r\nresponsible for any little skirmishing which may happen.\r\n\r\nBut, independently of any such grounds of active resistance, the subject\r\ninvolves interests so disproportioned to its intrinsic claims, that it\r\nis no more than an act of humanity to give it a public examination. If\r\nthe new doctrine is not truth, it is a dangerous, a deadly error. If it\r\nis a mere illusion, and acquires the same degree of influence that we\r\nhave often seen obtained by other illusions, there is not one of my\r\naudience who may not have occasion to deplore the fatal credulity which\r\nlistened to its promises.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore undertake a sober examination of its principles, its\r\nfacts, and some points of its history. The limited time at my disposal\r\nrequires me to condense as much as possible what I have to say, but\r\nI shall endeavor to be plain and direct in expressing it. Not one\r\nstatement shall be made which cannot be supported by unimpeachable\r\nreference: not one word shall be uttered which I am not as willing to\r\nprint as to speak. I have no quibbles to utter, and I shall stoop\r\nto answer none; but, with full faith in the sufficiency of a plain\r\nstatement of facts and reasons, I submit the subject to the discernment\r\nof my audience.\r\n\r\nThe question may be asked in the outset,--Have you submitted the\r\ndoctrines you are professing to examine to the test of long-repeated and\r\ncareful experiment; have you tried to see whether they were true or not?\r\nTo this I answer, that it is abundantly evident, from what has often\r\nhappened, that it would be of no manner of use for me to allege the\r\nresults of any experiments I might have instituted. Again and again have\r\nthe most explicit statements been made by the most competent persons of\r\nthe utter failure of all their trials, and there were the same abundant\r\nexplanations offered as used to be for the Unguentum Armarium and the\r\nMetallic Tractors. I could by no possibility perform any experiments\r\nthe result of which could not be easily explained away so as to be of no\r\nconclusive significance. Besides, as arguments in favor of Homoeopathy\r\nare constantly addressed to the public in journals, pamphlets, and even\r\nlectures, by inexperienced dilettanti, the same channel must be open to\r\nall its opponents.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, for the sake of those to whom the whole subject may\r\nbe new, to give in the smallest possible compass the substance of\r\nthe Homoeopathic Doctrine. Samuel Hahnemann, its founder, is a German\r\nphysician, now living in Paris, [Hahnemann died in 1843 at the age of\r\neighty-seven years. In 1796 he published the first paper containing his\r\npeculiar notions; in 1805 his first work on the subject; in 1810 his\r\nsomewhat famous “Organon of the Healing Art;” the next year what\r\nhe called the “Pure Materia Medica;” and in 1828 his last work, the\r\n“Treatise on Chronic Diseases.” He has therefore been writing at\r\nintervals on his favorite subject for nearly half a century.\r\n\r\nThe one great doctrine which constitutes the basis of Homoeopathy as a\r\nsystem is expressed by the Latin aphorism, “SIMILIA SIBILIBUS CURANTUR,”\r\n or like cures like, that is, diseases are cured by agents capable\r\nof producing symptoms resembling those found in the disease under\r\ntreatment. A disease for Hahnemann consists essentially in a group\r\nof symptoms. The proper medicine for any disease is the one which is\r\ncapable of producing a similar group of symptoms when given to a healthy\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nIt is of course necessary to know what are the trains of symptoms\r\nexcited by different substances, when administered to persons in health,\r\nif any such can be shown to exist. Hahnemann and his disciples give\r\ncatalogues of the symptoms which they affirm were produced upon\r\nthemselves or others by a large number of drugs which they submitted to\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe second great fact which Hahnemann professes to have established is\r\nthe efficacy of medicinal substances reduced to a wonderful degree of\r\nminuteness or dilution. The following account of his mode of preparing\r\nhis medicines is from his work on Chronic Diseases, which has not, I\r\nbelieve, yet been translated into English. A grain of the substance,\r\nif it is solid, a drop if it is liquid, is to be added to about a third\r\npart of one hundred grains of sugar of milk in an unglazed porcelain\r\ncapsule which has had the polish removed from the lower part of its\r\ncavity by rubbing it with wet sand; they are to be mingled for an\r\ninstant with a bone or horn spatula, and then rubbed together for six\r\nminutes; then the mass is to be scraped together from the mortar and\r\npestle, which is to take four minutes; then to be again rubbed for six\r\nminutes. Four minutes are then to be devoted to scraping the powder into\r\na heap, and the second third of the hundred grains of sugar of milk\r\nto be added. Then they are to be stirred an instant and rubbed six\r\nminutes,--again to be scraped together four minutes and forcibly rubbed\r\nsix; once more scraped together for four minutes, when the last third\r\nof the hundred grains of sugar of milk is to be added and mingled by\r\nstirring with the spatula; six minutes of forcible rubbing, four of\r\nscraping together, and six more (positively the last six) of rubbing,\r\nfinish this part of the process.\r\n\r\nEvery grain of this powder contains the hundredth of a grain of the\r\nmedicinal substance mingled with the sugar of milk. If, therefore, a\r\ngrain of the powder just prepared is mingled with another hundred grains\r\nof sugar of milk, and the process just described repeated, we shall have\r\na powder of which every grain contains the hundredth of the hundredth,\r\nor the ten thousandth part of a grain of the medicinal substance. Repeat\r\nthe same process with the same quantity of fresh sugar of milk, and\r\nevery grain of your powder will contain the millionth of a grain of the\r\nmedicinal substance. When the powder is of this strength, it is ready\r\nto employ in the further solutions and dilutions to be made use of in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nA grain of the powder is to be taken, a hundred drops of alcohol are\r\nto be poured on it, the vial is to be slowly turned for a few minutes,\r\nuntil the powder is dissolved, and two shakes are to be given to it. On\r\nthis point I will quote Hahnemann's own words. “A long experience and\r\nmultiplied observations upon the sick lead me within the last few\r\nyears to prefer giving only two shakes to medicinal liquids, whereas I\r\nformerly used to give ten.” The process of dilution is carried on in\r\nthe same way as the attenuation of the powder was done; each successive\r\ndilution with alcohol reducing the medicine to a hundredth part of the\r\nquantity of that which preceded it. In this way the dilution of the\r\noriginal millionth of a grain of medicine contained in the grain of\r\npowder operated on is carried successively to the billionth, trillionth,\r\nquadrillionth, quintillionth, and very often much higher fractional\r\ndivisions. A dose of any of these medicines is a minute fraction of a\r\ndrop, obtained by moistening with them one or more little globules of\r\nsugar, of which Hahnemann says it takes about two hundred to weigh a\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the strength of the medicines prescribed by Hahnemann,\r\nI will mention carbonate of lime. He does not employ common chalk, but\r\nprefers a little portion of the friable part of an oystershell. Of this\r\nsubstance, carried to the sextillionth degree, so much as one or two\r\nglobules of the size mentioned can convey is a common dose. But for\r\npersons of very delicate nerves it is proper that the dilution should\r\nbe carried to the decillionth degree. That is, an important medicinal\r\neffect is to be expected from the two hundredth or hundredth part of\r\nthe millionth of the millionth of the millionth of the millionth of\r\nthe millionth of the millionth of the millionth of the millionth of the\r\nmillionth of the millionth of a grain of oyster-shell. This is only\r\nthe tenth degree of potency, but some of his disciples profess to have\r\nobtained palpable effects from “much higher dilutions.”\r\n\r\nThe third great doctrine of Hahnemann is the following. Seven eighths\r\nat least of all chronic diseases are produced by the existence in the\r\nsystem of that infectious disorder known in the language of science\r\nby the appellation of PSORA, but to the less refined portion of the\r\ncommunity by the name of ITCH. In the words of Hahnemann's “Organon,”\r\n “This Psora is the sole true and fundamental cause that produces all\r\nthe other countless forms of disease, which, under the names of nervous\r\ndebility, hysteria, hypochondriasis, insanity, melancholy, idiocy,\r\nmadness, epilepsy, and spasms of all kinds, softening of the bones,\r\nor rickets, scoliosis and cyphosis, caries, cancer, fungua haematodes,\r\ngout,--yellow jaundice and cyanosis, dropsy,--”\r\n\r\n[“The degrees of DILUTION must not be confounded with those of POTENCY.\r\nTheir relations may be seen by this table:\r\n\r\nlst dilution,--One hundredth of a drop or grain.\r\n\r\n2d “ One ten thousandth.\r\n\r\n3d “ One millionth, marked I.\r\n\r\n4th “ One hundred millionth.\r\n\r\n5th “ One ten thousand millionth.\r\n\r\n6th “ One million millionth, or one billionth, marked II.\r\n\r\n7th “ One hundred billionth.\r\n\r\n8th “ One ten thousand billionth.\r\n\r\n9th “ One million billionth, or one trillionth, marked III.\r\n\r\n10th “ One hundred trillionth.\r\n\r\n11th “ One ten thousand trillionth.\r\n\r\n\r\n12th “ One million trillionth, or one quadrillionth, marked\r\n        IV.,--and so on indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe large figures denote the degrees of POTENCY.]\r\n\r\n“gastralgia, epistaxis, haemoptysis,--asthma and suppuration of the\r\nlungs,--megrim, deafness, cataract and amaurosis,--paralysis, loss of\r\nsense, pains of every kind, etc., appear in our pathology as so many\r\npeculiar, distinct, and independent diseases.”\r\n\r\nFor the last three centuries, if the same authority may be trusted,\r\nunder the influence of the more refined personal habits which have\r\nprevailed, and the application of various external remedies which repel\r\nthe affection from the skin; Psora has revealed itself in these numerous\r\nforms of internal disease, instead of appearing, as in former periods,\r\nunder the aspect of an external malady.\r\n\r\nThese are the three cardinal doctrines of Hahnemann, as laid down in\r\nthose standard works of Homoeopathy, the “Organon” and the “Treatise on\r\nChronic Diseases.”\r\n\r\nSeveral other principles may be added, upon all of which he insists with\r\ngreat force, and which are very generally received by his disciples.\r\n\r\n1. Very little power is allowed to the curative efforts of nature.\r\nHahnemann goes so far as to say that no one has ever seen the simple\r\nefforts of nature effect the durable recovery of a patient from a\r\nchronic disease. In general, the Homoeopathist calls every recovery\r\nwhich happens under his treatment a cure.\r\n\r\n2. Every medicinal substance must be administered in a state of the\r\nmost perfect purity, and uncombined with any other. The union of several\r\nremedies in a single prescription destroys its utility, and, according\r\nto the “Organon,” frequently adds a new disease.\r\n\r\n3. A large number of substances commonly thought to be inert develop\r\ngreat medicinal powers when prepared in the manner already described;\r\nand a great proportion of them are ascertained to have specific\r\nantidotes in case their excessive effects require to be neutralized.\r\n\r\n4. Diseases should be recognized, as far as possible, not by any of the\r\ncommon names imposed upon them, as fever or epilepsy, but as individual\r\ncollections of symptoms, each of which differs from every other\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n5. The symptoms of any complaint must be described with the most\r\nminute exactness, and so far as possible in the patient's own words. To\r\nillustrate the kind of circumstances the patient is expected to record,\r\nI will mention one or two from the 313th page of the “Treatise on\r\nChronic Diseases,”--being the first one at which I opened accidentally.\r\n\r\n“After dinner, disposition to sleep; the patient winks.”\r\n\r\n“After dinner, prostration and feeling of weakness (nine days after\r\ntaking the remedy).”\r\n\r\nThis remedy was that same oyster-shell which is to be prescribed\r\n“fractions of the sextillionth or decillionth degree.” According to\r\nHahnemann, the action of a single dose of the size mentioned does not\r\nfully display itself in some cases until twenty-four or even thirty\r\ndays after it is taken, and in such instances has not exhausted its good\r\neffects until towards the fortieth or fiftieth day,--before which time\r\nit would be absurd and injurious to administer a new remedy.\r\n\r\nSo much for the doctrines of Hahnemann, which have been stated without\r\ncomment, or exaggeration of any of their features, very much as any\r\nadherent of his opinions might have stated them, if obliged to compress\r\nthem into so narrow a space.\r\n\r\nDoes Hahnemann himself represent Homoeopathy as it now exists? He\r\ncertainly ought to be its best representative, after having created it,\r\nand devoted his life to it for half a century. He is spoken of as the\r\ngreat physician of the time, in most, if not all Homoeopathic works. If\r\nhe is not authority on the subject of his own doctrines, who is? So far\r\nas I am aware, not one tangible discovery in the so-called science has\r\never been ascribed to any other observer; at least, no general principle\r\nor law, of consequence enough to claim any prominence in Homoeopathic\r\nworks, has ever been pretended to have originated with any of his\r\nillustrious disciples. He is one of the only two Homoeopathic writers\r\nwith whom, as I shall mention, the Paris publisher will have anything to\r\ndo upon his own account. The other is Jahr, whose Manual is little more\r\nthan a catalogue of symptoms and remedies. If any persons choose to\r\nreject Hahnemann as not in the main representing Homoeopathy, if they\r\nstrike at his authority, if they wink out of sight his deliberate and\r\nformally announced results, it is an act of suicidal rashness; for upon\r\nhis sagacity and powers of observation, and experience, as embodied in\r\nhis works, and especially in his Materia Medica, repose the foundations\r\nof Homoeopathy as a practical system.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can learn from the conflicting statements made upon the\r\nsubject, the following is the present condition of belief.\r\n\r\n1. All of any note agree that the law Similia similibus is the only\r\nfundamental principle in medicine. Of course if any man does not agree\r\nto this the name Homoeopathist can no longer be applied to him with\r\npropriety.\r\n\r\n2. The belief in and employment of the infinitesimal doses is general,\r\nand in some places universal, among the advocates of Homoeopathy; but a\r\ndistinct movement has been made in Germany to get rid of any restriction\r\nto the use of these doses, and to employ medicines with the same license\r\nas other practitioners.\r\n\r\n3. The doctrine of the origin of most chronic diseases in Psora,\r\nnotwithstanding Hahnemann says it cost him twelve years of study and\r\nresearch to establish the fact and its practical consequences, has\r\nmet with great neglect and even opposition from very many of his own\r\ndisciples.\r\n\r\nIt is true, notwithstanding, that, throughout most of their writings\r\nwhich I have seen, there runs a prevailing tone of great deference to\r\nHahnemann's opinions, a constant reference to his authority, a general\r\nagreement with the minor points of his belief, and a pretence of\r\nharmonious union in a common faith. [Those who will take the trouble\r\nto look over Hull's Translation of Jahr's Manual may observe how little\r\ncomparative space is given to remedies resting upon any other authority\r\nthan that of Hahnemann.]\r\n\r\nMany persons, and most physicians and scientific men, would be satisfied\r\nwith the statement of these doctrines, and examine them no further.\r\nThey would consider it vastly more probable that any observer in so\r\nfallacious and difficult a field of inquiry as medicine had been led\r\ninto error, or walked into it of his own accord, than that such numerous\r\nand extraordinary facts had really just come to light. They would feel a\r\nright to exercise the same obduracy towards them as the French Institute\r\nis in the habit of displaying when memoirs or models are offered to it\r\nrelating to the squaring of the circle or perpetual motion; which it is\r\nthe rule to pass over without notice. They would feel as astronomers and\r\nnatural philosophers must have felt when, some half a dozen years ago,\r\nan unknown man came forward, and asked for an opportunity to demonstrate\r\nto Arago and his colleagues that the moon and planets were at a distance\r\nof a little more than a hundred miles from the earth. And so they would\r\nnot even look into Homoeopathy, though all its advocates should exclaim\r\nin the words of Mr. Benjamin Douglass Perkins, vender of the Metallic\r\nTractors, that “On all discoveries there are persons who, without\r\ndescending to any inquiry into the truth, pretend to know, as it were\r\nby intuition, that newly asserted facts are founded in the grossest\r\nerrors.” And they would lay their heads upon their pillows with a\r\nperfectly clear conscience, although they were assured that they were\r\nbehaving in the same way that people of old did towards Harvey, Galileo,\r\nand Copernicus, the identical great names which were invoked by Mr.\r\nBenjamin Douglass Perkins.\r\n\r\nBut experience has shown that the character of these assertions is\r\nnot sufficient to deter many, from examining their claims to belief.\r\nI therefore lean but very slightly on the extravagance and extreme\r\napparent singularity of their pretensions. I might have omitted them,\r\nbut on the whole it seemed more just to the claims of my argument\r\nto suggest the vast complication of improbabilities involved in the\r\nstatements enumerated. Every one must of course judge for himself as to\r\nthe weight of these objections, which are by no means brought forward as\r\na proof of the extravagance of Homoeopathy, but simply as entitled to\r\na brief consideration before the facts of the case are submitted to our\r\nscrutiny.\r\n\r\nThe three great asserted discoveries of Hahnemann are entirely\r\nunconnected with and independent of each other. Were there any natural\r\nrelation between them it would seem probable enough that the discovery\r\nof the first would have led to that of the others. But assuming it to be\r\na fact that diseases are cured by remedies capable of producing symptoms\r\nlike their own, no manifest relation exists between this fact and\r\nthe next assertion, namely, the power of the infinitesimal doses. And\r\nallowing both these to be true, neither has the remotest affinity to\r\nthe third new doctrine, that which declares seven eighths of all chronic\r\ndiseases to be owing to Psora.\r\n\r\nThis want of any obvious relation between Hahnemann's three cardinal\r\ndoctrines appears to be self-evident upon inspection. But if, as is\r\noften true with his disciples, they prefer the authority of one of their\r\nown number, I will refer them to Dr. Trinks's paper on the present state\r\nof Homoeopathy in Europe, with which, of course, they are familiar, as\r\nhis name is mentioned as one of the most prominent champions of their\r\nfaith, in their American official organ. It would be a fact without a\r\nparallel in the history, not merely of medicine, but of science, that\r\nthree such unconnected and astonishing discoveries, each of them a\r\ncomplete revolution of all that ages of the most varied experience had\r\nbeen taught to believe, should spring full formed from the brain of a\r\nsingle individual.\r\n\r\nLet us look a moment at the first of his doctrines. Improbable though\r\nit may seem to some, there is no essential absurdity involved in the\r\nproposition that diseases yield to remedies capable of producing like\r\nsymptoms. There are, on the other hand, some analogies which lend a\r\ndegree of plausibility to the statement. There are well-ascertained\r\nfacts, known from the earliest periods of medicine, showing that, under\r\ncertain circumstances, the very medicine which, from its known effects,\r\none would expect to aggravate the disease, may contribute to its relief.\r\nI may be permitted to allude, in the most general way, to the case in\r\nwhich the spontaneous efforts of an overtasked stomach are quieted by\r\nthe agency of a drug which that organ refuses to entertain upon any\r\nterms. But that every cure ever performed by medicine should have\r\nbeen founded upon this principle, although without the knowledge of a\r\nphysician; that the Homoeopathic axiom is, as Hahnemann asserts, “the\r\nsole law of nature in therapeutics,” a law of which nothing more than\r\na transient glimpse ever presented itself to the innumerable host of\r\nmedical observers, is a dogma of such sweeping extent, and pregnant\r\nnovelty, that it demands a corresponding breadth and depth of\r\nunquestionable facts to cover its vast pretensions.\r\n\r\nSo much ridicule has been thrown upon the pretended powers of the\r\nminute doses that I shall only touch upon this point for the purpose of\r\nconveying, by illustrations, some shadow of ideas far transcending the\r\npowers of the imagination to realize. It must be remembered that these\r\ncomparisons are not matters susceptible of dispute, being founded\r\non simple arithmetical computations, level to the capacity of any\r\nintelligent schoolboy. A person who once wrote a very small pamphlet\r\nmade some show of objecting to calculations of thus kind, on the ground\r\nthat the highest dilutions could easily be made with a few ounces of\r\nalcohol. But he should have remembered that at every successive dilution\r\nhe lays aside or throws away ninety-nine hundredths of the fluid on\r\nwhich he is operating, and that, although he begins with a drop, he only\r\nprepares a millionth, billionth, trillionth, and similar fractions of\r\nit, all of which, added together, would constitute but a vastly minute\r\nportion of the drop with which he began. But now let us suppose we take\r\none single drop of the Tincture of Camomile, and that the whole of this\r\nwere to be carried through the common series of dilutions.\r\n\r\nA calculation nearly like the following was made by Dr. Panvini, and may\r\nbe readily followed in its essential particulars by any one who chooses.\r\n\r\nFor the first dilution it would take 100 drops of alcohol.\r\n\r\nFor the second dilution it would take 10,000 drops, or about a pint.\r\n\r\nFor the third dilution it would take 100 pints.\r\n\r\nFor the fourth dilution it would take 10,000 pints, or more than 1,000\r\ngallons, and so on to the ninth dilution, which would take ten billion\r\ngallons, which he computed would fill the basin of Lake Agnano, a body\r\nof water two miles in circumference. The twelfth dilution would of\r\ncourse fill a million such lakes. By the time the seventeenth degree of\r\ndilution should be reached, the alcohol required would equal in quantity\r\nthe waters of ten thousand Adriatic seas. Trifling errors must be\r\nexpected, but they are as likely to be on one side as the other, and any\r\nlittle matter like Lake Superior or the Caspian would be but a drop in\r\nthe bucket.\r\n\r\nSwallowers of globules, one of your little pellets, moistened in\r\nthe mingled waves of one million lakes of alcohol, each two miles in\r\ncircumference, with which had been blended that one drop of Tincture\r\nof Camomile, would be of precisely the strength recommended for that\r\nmedicine in your favorite Jahr's Manual, “against the most sudden,\r\nfrightful, and fatal diseases!” [In the French edition of 1834, the\r\nproper doses of the medicines are mentioned, and Camomile is marked\r\nIV. Why are the doses omitted in Hull's Translation, except in three\r\ninstances out of the whole two hundred remedies, notwithstanding the\r\npromise in the preface that “some remarks upon the doses used may\r\nbe found at the head of each medicine”? Possibly because it makes\r\nno difference whether they are employed in one Homoeopathic dose or\r\nanother; but then it is very singular that such precise directions\r\nwere formerly given in the same work, and that Hahnemann's “experience”\r\n should have led him to draw the nice distinctions we have seen in a\r\nformer part of this Lecture (p. 44).]\r\n\r\nAnd proceeding on the common data, I have just made a calculation\r\nwhich shows that this single drop of Tincture of Camomile, given in the\r\nquantity ordered by Jahr's Manual, would have supplied every individual\r\nof the whole human family, past and present, with more than five billion\r\ndoses each, the action of each dose lasting about four days.\r\n\r\nYet this is given only at the quadrillionth, or fourth degree of\r\npotency, and various substances are frequently administered at\r\nthe decillionth or tenth degree, and occasionally at still higher\r\nattenuations with professed medicinal results. Is there not in this as\r\ngreat an exception to all the hitherto received laws of nature as in the\r\nmiracle of the loaves and fishes? Ask this question of a Homoeopathist,\r\nand he will answer by referring to the effects produced by a very minute\r\nportion of vaccine matter, or the extraordinary diffusion of odors. But\r\nthe vaccine matter is one of those substances called morbid poisons, of\r\nwhich it is a peculiar character to multiply themselves, when introduced\r\ninto the system, as a seed does in the soil. Therefore the hundredth\r\npart of a grain of the vaccine matter, if no more than this is employed,\r\nsoon increases in quantity, until, in the course of about a week, it is\r\na grain or more, and can be removed in considerable drops. And what is\r\na very curious illustration of Homoeopathy, it does not produce its most\r\ncharacteristic effects until it is already in sufficient quantity\r\nnot merely to be visible, but to be collected for further use. The\r\nthoughtlessness which can allow an inference to be extended from a\r\nproduct of disease possessing this susceptibility of multiplication when\r\nconveyed into the living body, to substances of inorganic origin, such\r\nas silex or sulphur, would be capable of arguing that a pebble may\r\nproduce a mountain, because an acorn can become a forest.\r\n\r\nAs to the analogy to be found between the alleged action of the\r\ninfinitely attenuated doses, and the effects of some odorous substances\r\nwhich possess the extraordinary power of diffusing their imponderable\r\nemanations through a very wide space, however it may be abused in\r\nargument, and rapidly as it evaporates on examination, it is not like\r\nthat just mentioned, wholly without meaning. The fact of the vast\r\ndiffusion of some odors, as that of musk or the rose, for instance, has\r\nlong been cited as the most remarkable illustration of the divisibility\r\nof matter, and the nicety of the senses. And if this were compared with\r\nthe effects of a very minute dose of morphia on the whole system, or the\r\nsudden and fatal impression of a single drop of prussic acid, or,\r\nwith what comes still nearer, the poisonous influence of an atmosphere\r\nimpregnated with invisible malaria, we should find in each of these\r\nexamples an evidence of the degree to which nature, in some few\r\ninstances, concentrates powerful qualities in minute or subtile forms of\r\nmatter. But if a man comes to me with a pestle and mortar in his hand,\r\nand tells me that he will take a little speck of some substance which\r\nnobody ever thought to have any smell at all, as, for instance, a grain\r\nof chalk or of charcoal, and that he will, after an hour or two of\r\nrubbing and scraping, develop in a portion of it an odor which, if the\r\nwhole grain were used, would be capable of pervading an apartment, a\r\nhouse, a village, a province, an empire, nay, the entire atmosphere of\r\nthis broad planet upon which we tread; and that from each of fifty or\r\nsixty substances he can in this way develop a distinct and hitherto\r\nunknown odor: and if he tries to show that all this is rendered quite\r\nreasonable by the analogy of musk and roses, I shall certainly be\r\njustified in considering him incapable of reasoning, and beyond the\r\nreach of my argument. What if, instead of this, he professes to develop\r\nnew and wonderful medicinal powers from the same speck of chalk or\r\ncharcoal, in such proportions as would impregnate every pond, lake,\r\nriver, sea, and ocean of our globe, and appeals to the same analogy in\r\nfavor of the probability of his assertion.\r\n\r\nAll this may be true, notwithstanding these considerations. But so\r\nextraordinary would be the fact, that a single atom of substances which\r\na child might swallow without harm by the teaspoonful could, by an easy\r\nmechanical process, be made to develop such inconceivable powers, that\r\nnothing but the strictest agreement of the most cautious experimenters,\r\nsecured by every guaranty that they were honest and faithful, appealing\r\nto repeated experiments in public, with every precaution to guard\r\nagainst error, and with the most plain and peremptory results, should\r\ninduce us to lend any credence to such pretensions.\r\n\r\nThe third doctrine, that Psora, the other name of which you remember, is\r\nthe cause of the great majority of chronic diseases, is a startling\r\none, to say the least. That an affection always recognized as a\r\nvery unpleasant personal companion, but generally regarded as a\r\nmere temporary incommodity, readily yielding to treatment in those\r\nunfortunate enough to suffer from it, and hardly known among the\r\nbetter classes of society, should be all at once found out by a German\r\nphysician to be the great scourge of mankind, the cause of their\r\nseverest bodily and mental calamities, cancer and consumption, idiocy\r\nand madness, must excite our unqualified surprise. And when the\r\noriginator of this singular truth ascribes, as in the page now open\r\nbefore me, the declining health of a disgraced courtier, the chronic\r\nmalady of a bereaved mother, even the melancholy of the love-sick\r\nand slighted maiden, to nothing more nor less than the insignificant,\r\nunseemly, and almost unmentionable ITCH, does it not seem as if the\r\nvery soil upon which we stand were dissolving into chaos, over the\r\nearthquake-heaving of discovery?\r\n\r\nAnd when one man claims to have established these three independent\r\ntruths, which are about as remote from each other as the discovery\r\nof the law of gravitation, the invention of printing, and that of the\r\nmariner's compass, unless the facts in their favor are overwhelming\r\nand unanimous, the question naturally arises, Is not this man deceiving\r\nhimself, or trying to deceive others?\r\n\r\nI proceed to examine the proofs of the leading ideas of Hahnemann and\r\nhis school.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the axiom, similia similibus curantur (or like is cured\r\nby like), to be the basis of the healing art,--“the sole law of nature\r\nin therapeutics,”--it is necessary,\r\n\r\n1. That the symptoms produced by drugs in healthy persons should be\r\nfaithfully studied and recorded.\r\n\r\n2. That drugs should be shown to be always capable of curing those\r\ndiseases most like their own symptoms.\r\n\r\n3. That remedies should be shown not to cure diseases when they do not\r\nproduce symptoms resembling those presented in these diseases.\r\n\r\n1. The effects of drugs upon healthy persons have been studied by\r\nHahnemann and his associates. Their results were made known in his\r\nMateria Medica, a work in three large volumes in the French translation,\r\npublished about eight years ago. The mode of experimentation appears to\r\nhave been, to take the substance on trial, either in common or minute\r\ndoses, and then to set down every little sensation, every little\r\nmovement of mind or body, which occurred within many succeeding hours\r\nor days, as being produced solely by the substance employed. When I have\r\nenumerated some of the symptoms attributed to the power of the drugs\r\ntaken, you will be able to judge how much value is to be ascribed to the\r\nassertions of such observers.\r\n\r\nThe following list was taken literally from the Materia Medica of\r\nHahnemann, by my friend M. Vernois, for whose accuracy I am willing\r\nto be responsible. He has given seven pages of these symptoms, not\r\nselected, but taken at hazard from the French translation of the work. I\r\nshall be very brief in my citations.\r\n\r\n“After stooping some time, sense of painful weight about the head upon\r\nresuming the erect posture.”\r\n\r\n“An itching, tickling sensation at the outer edge of the palm of the\r\nleft hand, which obliges the person to scratch.” The medicine was\r\nacetate of lime, and as the action of the globule taken is said to last\r\ntwenty-eight days, you may judge how many such symptoms as the last\r\nmight be supposed to happen.\r\n\r\nAmong the symptoms attributed to muriatic acid are these: a catarrh,\r\nsighing, pimples; “after having written a long time with the back a\r\nlittle bent over, violent pain in the back and shoulder-blades, as\r\nif from a strain,”--“dreams which are not remembered,--disposition to\r\nmental dejection,--wakefulness before and after midnight.”\r\n\r\nI might extend this catalogue almost indefinitely. I have not cited\r\nthese specimens with any view to exciting a sense of the ridiculous,\r\nwhich many others of those mentioned would not fail to do, but to show\r\nthat the common accidents of sensation, the little bodily inconveniences\r\nto which all of us are subject, are seriously and systematically\r\nascribed to whatever medicine may have been exhibited, even in the\r\nminute doses I have mentioned, whole days or weeks previously.\r\n\r\nTo these are added all the symptoms ever said by anybody, whether\r\ndeserving confidence or not, as I shall hereafter illustrate, to be\r\nproduced by the substance in question.\r\n\r\nThe effects of sixty-four medicinal substances, ascertained by one\r\nor both of these methods, are enumerated in the Materia Medica\r\nof Hahnemann, which may be considered as the basis of practical\r\nHomoeopathy. In the Manual of Jahr, which is the common guide, so far as\r\nI know, of those who practise Homoeopathy in these regions, two hundred\r\nremedies are enumerated, many of which, however, have never been\r\nemployed in practice. In at least one edition there were no means of\r\ndistinguishing those which had been tried upon the sick from the others.\r\nIt is true that marks have been added in the edition employed here,\r\nwhich serve to distinguish them; but what are we to think of a standard\r\npractical author on Materia Medica, who at one time omits to designate\r\nthe proper doses of his remedies, and at another to let us have any\r\nmeans of knowing whether a remedy has ever been tried or not, while\r\nhe is recommending its employment in the most critical and threatening\r\ndiseases?\r\n\r\nI think that, from what I have shown of the character of Hahnemann's\r\nexperiments, it would be a satisfaction to any candid inquirer to\r\nknow whether other persons, to whose assertions he could look\r\nwith confidence, confirm these pretended facts. Now there are many\r\nindividuals, long and well known to the scientific world, who have tried\r\nthese experiments upon healthy subjects, and utterly deny that their\r\neffects have at all corresponded to Hahnemann's assertions.\r\n\r\nI will take, for instance, the statements of Andral (and I am not\r\nreferring to his well-known public experiments in his hospital) as to\r\nthe result of his own trials. This distinguished physician is Professor\r\nof Medicine in the School of Paris, and one of the most widely known and\r\nvalued authors upon practical and theoretical subjects the profession\r\ncan claim in any country. He is a man of great kindness of character,\r\na most liberal eclectic by nature and habit, of unquestioned integrity,\r\nand is called, in the leading article of the first number of the\r\n“Homoepathic Examiner,” “an eminent and very enlightened allopathist.”\r\n Assisted by a number of other persons in good health, he experimented\r\non the effects of cinchona, aconite, sulphur, arnica, and the other most\r\nhighly extolled remedies. His experiments lasted a year, and he stated\r\npublicly to the Academy of Medicine that they never produced the\r\nslightest appearance of the symptoms attributed to them. The results of\r\na man like this, so extensively known as one of the most philosophical\r\nand candid, as well as brilliant of instructors, and whose admirable\r\nabilities and signal liberality are generally conceded, ought to be of\r\ngreat weight in deciding the question.\r\n\r\nM. Double, a well-known medical writer and a physician of high standing\r\nin Paris, had occasion so long ago as 1801, before he had heard of\r\nHomoeopathy, to make experiments upon Cinchona, or Peruvian bark. He and\r\nseveral others took the drug in every kind of dose for four months, and\r\nthe fever it is pretended by Hahnemann to excite never was produced.\r\n\r\nM. Bonnet, President of the Royal Society of Medicine of Bordeaux, had\r\noccasion to observe many soldiers during the Peninsular War, who made\r\nuse of Cinchona as a preservative against different diseases, but he\r\nnever found it to produce the pretended paroxysms.\r\n\r\nIf any objection were made to evidence of this kind, I would refer to\r\nthe express experiments on many of the Homoeopathic substances, which\r\nwere given to healthy persons with every precaution as to diet and\r\nregimen, by M. Louis Fleury, without being followed by the slightest of\r\nthe pretended consequences. And let me mention as a curious fact, that\r\nthe same quantity of arsenic given to one animal in the common form of\r\nthe unprepared powder, and to another after having been rubbed up into\r\nsix hundred globules, offered no particular difference of activity in\r\nthe two cases.\r\n\r\nThis is a strange contradiction to the doctrine of the development of\r\nwhat they call dynamic power, by means of friction and subdivision.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 a public challenge was offered to the best known Homoeopathic\r\nphysician in Paris to select any ten substances asserted to produce the\r\nmost striking effects; to prepare them himself; to choose one by lot\r\nwithout knowing which of them he had taken, and try it upon himself or\r\nany intelligent and devoted Homoeopathist, and, waiting his own time,\r\nto come forward and tell what substance had been employed. The challenge\r\nwas at first accepted, but the acceptance retracted before the time of\r\ntrial arrived.\r\n\r\nFrom all this I think it fair to conclude that the catalogues of\r\nsymptoms attributed in Homoeopathic works to the influence of various\r\ndrugs upon healthy persons are not entitled to any confidence.\r\n\r\n2. It is necessary to show, in the next place, that medicinal substances\r\nare always capable of curing diseases most like their own symptoms.\r\nFor facts relating to this question we must look to two sources; the\r\nrecorded experience of the medical profession in general, and the\r\nresults of trials made according to Homoeopathic principles, and capable\r\nof testing the truth of the doctrine.\r\n\r\nNo person, that I am aware of, has ever denied that in some cases there\r\nexists a resemblance between the effects of a remedy and the symptoms\r\nof diseases in which it is beneficial. This has been recognized, as\r\nHahnemann himself has shown, from the time of Hippocrates. But according\r\nto the records of the medical profession, as they have been hitherto\r\ninterpreted, this is true of only a very small proportion of useful\r\nremedies. Nor has it ever been considered as an established truth that\r\nthe efficacy of even these few remedies was in any definite ratio to\r\ntheir power of producing symptoms more or less like those they cured.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of opinion when Hahnemann came forward with the\r\nproposition that all the cases of successful treatment found in the\r\nworks of all preceding medical writers were to be ascribed solely to the\r\noperation of the Homoeopathic principle, which had effected the cure,\r\nalthough without the physician's knowledge that this was the real\r\nsecret. And strange as it may seem, he was enabled to give such a\r\ndegree of plausibility to this assertion, that any person not acquainted\r\nsomewhat with medical literature, not quite familiar, I should rather\r\nsay, with the relative value of medical evidence, according to the\r\nsources whence it is derived, would be almost frightened into the\r\nbelief, at seeing the pages upon pages of Latin names he has summoned as\r\nhis witnesses.\r\n\r\nIt has hitherto been customary, when examining the writings of authors\r\nof preceding ages, upon subjects as to which they were less enlightened\r\nthan ourselves, and which they were very liable to misrepresent, to\r\nexercise some little discretion; to discriminate, in some measure,\r\nbetween writers deserving confidence and those not entitled to it. But\r\nthere is not the least appearance of any such delicacy on the part of\r\nHahnemann. A large majority of the names of old authors he cites\r\nare wholly unknown to science. With some of them I have been long\r\nacquainted, and I know that their accounts of diseases are no more to be\r\ntrusted than their contemporary Ambroise Pare's stories of mermen,\r\nand similar absurdities. But if my judgment is rejected, as being\r\na prejudiced one, I can refer to Cullen, who mentioned three of\r\nHahnemann's authors in one sentence, as being “not necessarily bad\r\nauthorities; but certainly such when they delivered very improbable\r\nevents;” and as this was said more than half a century ago, it could not\r\nhave had any reference to Hahnemann. But although not the slightest\r\nsign of discrimination is visible in his quotations,--although for him\r\na handful of chaff from Schenck is all the same thing as a measure of\r\nwheat from Morgagni,--there is a formidable display of authorities, and\r\nan abundant proof of ingenious researches to be found in each of\r\nthe great works of Hahnemann with which I am familiar. [Some painful\r\nsurmises might arise as to the erudition of Hahnemann's English\r\nTranslator, who makes two individuals of “Zacutus, Lucitanus,” as\r\nwell as respecting that of the conductors of an American Homoeopathic\r\nperiodical, who suffer the name of the world-renowned Cardanus to be\r\nspelt Cardamus in at least three places, were not this gross ignorance\r\nof course attributable only to the printer.]\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Dr. Leo-Wolf, that Professor Joerg, of Leipsic, has\r\nproved many of Hahnemann's quotations from old authors to be adulterate\r\nand false. What particular instances he has pointed out I have no means\r\nof learning. And it is probably wholly impossible on this side of the\r\nAtlantic, and even in most of the public libraries of Europe, to\r\nfind anything more than a small fraction of the innumerable obscure\r\npublications which the neglect of grocers and trunkmakers has spared\r\nto be ransacked by the all-devouring genius of Homoeopathy. I have\r\nendeavored to verify such passages as my own library afforded me the\r\nmeans of doing. For some I have looked in vain, for want, as I am\r\nwilling to believe, of more exact references. But this I am able to\r\naffirm, that, out of the very small number which I have been able, to\r\ntrace back to their original authors, I have found two to be wrongly\r\nquoted, one of them being a gross misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe first is from the ancient Roman author, Caelius Aurelianus;\r\nthe second from the venerable folio of Forestus. Hahnemann uses the\r\nfollowing expressions,--if he is not misrepresented in the English\r\nTranslation of the 'Organon': “Asclepiades on one occasion cured an\r\ninflammation of the brain by administering a small quantity of wine.”\r\n After correcting the erroneous reference of the Translator, I can find\r\nno such case alluded to in the chapter. But Caelius Aurelianus mentions\r\ntwo modes of treatment employed by Asclepiades, into both of which the\r\nuse of wine entered, as being “in the highest degree irrational and\r\ndangerous.” [Caelius Aurel. De Morb. Acut. et Chron. lib. I. cap. xv.\r\nnot xvi. Amsterdam. Wetstein, 1755.]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the oil of anise-seed, Hahnemann says that Forestus\r\nobserved violent colic caused by its administration. But, as the author\r\ntells the story, a young man took, by the counsel of a surgeon, an acrid\r\nand virulent medicine, the name of which is not given, which brought on\r\na most cruel fit of the gripes and colic. After this another surgeon was\r\ncalled, who gave him oil of anise-seed and wine, “which increased his\r\nsuffering.” [Observ. et Curat. Med. lib. XXI obs. xiii. Frankfort,\r\n1614.] Now if this was the Homoeopathic remedy, as Hahnemann pretends,\r\nit might be a fair question why the young man was not cured by it. But\r\nit is a much graver question why a man who has shrewdness and learning\r\nenough to go so far after his facts, should think it right to treat them\r\nwith such astonishing negligence or such artful unfairness.\r\n\r\nEven if every word he had pretended to take from his old authorities\r\nwere to be found in them, even if the authority of every one of these\r\nauthors were beyond question, the looseness with which they are used to\r\nprove whatever Hahnemann chooses is beyond the bounds of credibility.\r\nLet me give one instance to illustrate the character of this man's\r\nmind. Hahnemann asserts, in a note annexed to the 110th paragraph of\r\nthe “Organon,” that the smell of the rose will cause certain persons to\r\nfaint. And he says in the text that substances which produce peculiar\r\neffects of this nature on particular constitutions cure the same\r\nsymptoms in people in general. Then in another note to the same\r\nparagraph he quotes the following fact from one of the last sources one\r\nwould have looked to for medical information, the Byzantine Historians.\r\n\r\n“It was by these means (i.e. Homoeopathically) that the Princess Eudosia\r\nwith rose-water restored a person who had fainted!”\r\n\r\nIs it possible that a man who is guilty of such pedantic folly as\r\nthis,--a man who can see a confirmation of his doctrine in such a\r\nrecovery as this,--a recovery which is happening every day, from\r\na breath of air, a drop or two of water, untying a bonnet-string,\r\nloosening a stay-lace, and which can hardly help happening, whatever\r\nis done,--is it possible that a man, of whose pages, not here and there\r\none, but hundreds upon hundreds are loaded with such trivialities, is\r\nthe Newton, the Columbus, the Harvey of the nineteenth century!\r\n\r\nThe whole process of demonstration he employs is this. An experiment is\r\ninstituted with some drug upon one or more healthy persons. Everything\r\nthat happens for a number of days or weeks is, as we have seen, set\r\ndown as an effect of the medicine. Old volumes are then ransacked\r\npromiscuously, and every morbid sensation or change that anybody ever\r\nsaid was produced by the drug in question is added to the list of\r\nsymptoms. By one or both of these methods, each of the sixty-four\r\nsubstances enumerated by Hahnemann is shown to produce a very large\r\nnumber of symptoms, the lowest in his scale being ninety-seven, and the\r\nhighest fourteen hundred and ninety-one. And having made out this\r\nlist respecting any drug, a catalogue which, as you may observe in any\r\nHomoeopathic manual, contains various symptoms belonging to every organ\r\nof the body, what can be easier than to find alleged cures in every\r\nmedical author which can at once be attributed to the Homoeopathic\r\nprinciple; still more if the grave of extinguished credulity is called\r\nupon to give up its dead bones as living witnesses; and worst of all, if\r\nthe monuments of the past are to be mutilated in favor of “the sole law\r\nof Nature in therapeutics”?\r\n\r\nThere are a few familiar facts of which great use has been made as an\r\nentering wedge for the Homoeopathic doctrine. They have been suffered\r\nto pass current so long that it is time they should be nailed to\r\nthe counter, a little operation which I undertake, with perfect\r\ncheerfulness, to perform for them.\r\n\r\nThe first is a supposed illustration of the Homoeopathic law found in\r\nthe precept given for the treatment of parts which have been frozen, by\r\nfriction with snow or similar means. But we deceive ourselves by names,\r\nif we suppose the frozen part to be treated by cold, and not by heat.\r\nThe snow may even be actually warmer than the part to which it is\r\napplied. But even if it were at the same temperature when applied, it\r\nnever did and never could do the least good to a frozen part, except as\r\na mode of regulating the application of what? of heat. But the heat must\r\nbe applied gradually, just as food must be given a little at a time to\r\nthose perishing with hunger. If the patient were brought into a warm\r\nroom, heat would be applied very rapidly, were not something interposed\r\nto prevent this, and allow its gradual admission. Snow or iced water is\r\nexactly what is wanted; it is not cold to the part; it is very possibly\r\nwarm, on the contrary, for these terms are relative, and if it does not\r\nmelt and let the heat in, or is not taken away, the part will remain\r\nfrozen up until doomsday. Now the treatment of a frozen limb by heat, in\r\nlarge or small quantities, is not Homoeopathy.\r\n\r\nThe next supposed illustration of the Homoeopathic law is the alleged\r\nsuccessful management of burns, by holding them to the fire. This is a\r\npopular mode of treating those burns which are of too little consequence\r\nto require any more efficacious remedy, and would inevitably get well of\r\nthemselves, without any trouble being bestowed upon them. It produces\r\na most acute pain in the part, which is followed by some loss of\r\nsensibility, as happens with the eye after exposure to strong light, and\r\nthe ear after being subjected to very intense sounds. This is all it\r\nis capable of doing, and all further notions of its efficacy must be\r\nattributed merely to the vulgar love of paradox. If this example affords\r\nany comfort to the Homoeopathist, it seems as cruel to deprive him of\r\nit as it would be to convince the mistress of the smoke-jack or the\r\nflatiron that the fire does not literally “draw the fire out,” which is\r\nher hypothesis.\r\n\r\nBut if it were true that frost-bites were cured by cold and burns by\r\nheat, it would be subversive, so far as it went, of the great principle\r\nof Homoeopathy.\r\n\r\nFor you will remember that this principle is that Like cures Like, and\r\nnot that Same cures Same; that there is resemblance and not identity\r\nbetween the symptoms of the disease and those produced by the drug which\r\ncures it, and none have been readier to insist upon this distinction\r\nthan the Homoeopathists themselves. For if Same cures Same, then every\r\npoison must be its own antidote,--which is neither a part of their\r\ntheory nor their so-called experience. They have been asked often\r\nenough, why it was that arsenic could not cure the mischief which\r\narsenic had caused, and why the infectious cause of small-pox did not\r\nremedy the disease it had produced, and then they were ready enough to\r\nsee the distinction I have pointed out. O no! it was not the hair of the\r\nsame dog, but only of one very much like him!\r\n\r\nA third instance in proof of the Homoeopathic law is sought for in the\r\nacknowledged efficacy of vaccination. And how does the law apply to\r\nthis? It is granted by the advocates of Homoeopathy that there is a\r\nresemblance between the effects of the vaccine virus on a person in\r\nhealth and the symptoms of small-pox. Therefore, according to the rule,\r\nthe vaccine virus will cure the small-pox, which, as everybody knows, is\r\nentirely untrue. But it prevents small-pox, say the Homoeopathists. Yes,\r\nand so does small-pox prevent itself from ever happening again, and we\r\nknow just as much of the principle involved in the one case as in the\r\nother. For this is only one of a series of facts which we are wholly\r\nunable to explain. Small-pox, measles, scarlet-fever, hooping-cough,\r\nprotect those who have them once from future attacks; but nettle-rash\r\nand catarrh and lung fever, each of which is just as Homoeopathic to\r\nitself as any one of the others, have no such preservative power. We\r\nare obliged to accept the fact, unexplained, and we can do no more for\r\nvaccination than for the rest.\r\n\r\nI come now to the most directly practical point connected with the\r\nsubject, namely,--\r\n\r\nWhat is the state of the evidence as to the efficacy of the proper\r\nHomoeopathic treatment in the cure of diseases.\r\n\r\nAs the treatment adopted by the Homoeopathists has been almost\r\nuniversally by means of the infinitesimal doses, the question of their\r\nefficacy is thrown open, in common with that of the truth of their\r\nfundamental axiom, as both are tested in practice.\r\n\r\nWe must look for facts as to the actual working of Homoeopathy to three\r\nsources.\r\n\r\n1. The statements of the unprofessional public.\r\n\r\n2. The assertions of Homoeopathic practitioners.\r\n\r\n3. The results of trials by competent and honest physicians, not pledged\r\nto the system.\r\n\r\nI think, after what we have seen of medical facts, as they are\r\nrepresented by incompetent persons, we are disposed to attribute little\r\nvalue to all statements of wonderful cures, coming from those who have\r\nnever been accustomed to watch the caprices of disease, and have not\r\ncooled down their young enthusiasm by the habit of tranquil observation.\r\nThose who know nothing of the natural progress of a malady, of its\r\nordinary duration, of its various modes of terminating, of its liability\r\nto accidental complications, of the signs which mark its insignificance\r\nor severity, of what is to be expected of it when left to itself, of how\r\nmuch or how little is to be anticipated from remedies, those who know\r\nnothing or next to nothing of all these things, and who are in a great\r\nstate of excitement from benevolence, sympathy, or zeal for a new\r\nmedical discovery, can hardly be expected to be sound judges of facts\r\nwhich have misled so many sagacious men, who have spent their lives in\r\nthe daily study and observation of them. I believe that, after having\r\ndrawn the portrait of defunct Perkinism, with its five thousand printed\r\ncures, and its million and a half computed ones, its miracles blazoned\r\nabout through America, Denmark, and England; after relating that forty\r\nyears ago women carried the Tractors about in their pockets, and workmen\r\ncould not make them fast enough for the public demand; and then showing\r\nyou, as a curiosity, a single one of these instruments, an odd one of a\r\npair, which I obtained only by a lucky accident, so utterly lost is the\r\nmemory of all their wonderful achievements; I believe, after all this, I\r\nneed not waste time in showing that medical accuracy is not to be looked\r\nfor in the florid reports of benevolent associations, the assertions\r\nof illustrious patrons, the lax effusions of daily journals, or the\r\neffervescent gossip of the tea-table.\r\n\r\nDr. Hering, whose name is somewhat familiar to the champions of\r\nHomoeopathy, has said that “the new healing art is not to be judged\r\nby its success in isolated cases only, but according to its success in\r\ngeneral, its innate truth, and the incontrovertible nature of its innate\r\nprinciples.”\r\n\r\nWe have seen something of “the incontrovertible nature of its innate\r\nprinciples,” and it seems probable, on the whole, that its success in\r\ngeneral must be made up of its success in isolated cases. Some attempts\r\nhave been made, however, to finish the whole matter by sweeping\r\nstatistical documents, which are intended to prove its triumphant\r\nsuccess over the common practice.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to those who have had the good fortune to see the\r\n“Homoeopathic Examiner,” that this journal led off, in its first number,\r\nwith a grand display of everything the newly imported doctrine had to\r\nshow for itself. It is well remarked, on the twenty-third page of this\r\narticle, that “the comparison of bills of mortality among an equal\r\nnumber of sick, treated by divers methods, is a most poor and lame\r\nway to get at conclusions touching principles of the healing art.” In\r\nconfirmation of which, the author proceeds upon the twenty-fifth page\r\nto prove the superiority of the Homoeopathic treatment of cholera,\r\nby precisely these very bills of mortality. Now, every intelligent\r\nphysician is aware that the poison of cholera differed so much in its\r\nactivity at different times and, places, that it was next to impossible\r\nto form any opinion as to the results of treatment, unless every\r\nprecaution was taken to secure the most perfectly corresponding\r\nconditions in the patients treated, and hardly even then. Of course,\r\nthen, a Russian Admiral, by the name of Mordvinov, backed by a number\r\nof so-called physicians practising in Russian villages, is singularly\r\ncompetent to the task of settling the whole question of the utility of\r\nthis or that kind of treatment; to prove that, if not more than eight\r\nand a half per cent. of those attacked with the disease perished, the\r\nrest owed their immunity to Hahnemann. I can remember when more than\r\na hundred patients in a public institution were attacked with what, I\r\ndoubt not, many Homoeopathic physicians (to say nothing of Homoeopathic\r\nadmirals) would have called cholera, and not one of them died, though\r\ntreated in the common way, and it is my firm belief that, if such a\r\nresult had followed the administration of the omnipotent globules, it\r\nwould have been in the mouth of every adept in Europe, from Quin of\r\nLondon to Spohr of Gandersheim. No longer ago than yesterday, in one of\r\nthe most widely circulated papers of this city, there was published an\r\nassertion that the mortality in several Homoeopathic Hospitals was\r\nnot quite five in a hundred, whereas, in what are called by the writer\r\nAllopathic Hospitals, it is said to be eleven in a hundred. An honest\r\nman should be ashamed of such an argumentum ad ignorantiam. The\r\nmortality of a hospital depends not merely on the treatment of the\r\npatients, but on the class of diseases it is in the habit of receiving,\r\non the place where it is, on the season, and many other circumstances.\r\nFor instance, there are many hospitals in the great cities of Europe\r\nthat receive few diseases of a nature to endanger life, and, on the\r\nother hand, there are others where dangerous diseases are accumulated\r\nout of the common proportion. Thus, in the wards of Louis, at the\r\nHospital of La Pitie, a vast number of patients in the last stages of\r\nconsumption were constantly entering, to swell the mortality of that\r\nhospital. It was because he was known to pay particular attention to\r\nthe diseases of the chest that patients laboring under those fatal\r\naffections to an incurable extent were so constantly coming in upon him.\r\nIt is always a miserable appeal to the thoughtlessness of the vulgar, to\r\nallege the naked fact of the less comparative mortality in the practice\r\nof one hospital or of one physician than another, as an evidence of the\r\nsuperiority of their treatment. Other things being equal, it must always\r\nbe expected that those institutions and individuals enjoying to the\r\nhighest degree the confidence of the community will lose the largest\r\nproportion of their patients; for the simple reason that they will\r\nnaturally be looked to by those suffering from the gravest class\r\nof diseases; that many, who know that they are affected with mortal\r\ndisease, will choose to die under their care or shelter, while the\r\nsubjects of trifling maladies, and merely troublesome symptoms, amuse\r\nthemselves to any extent among the fancy practitioners. When, therefore,\r\nDr. Mublenbein, as stated in the “Homoeopathic Examiner,” and quoted\r\nin yesterday's “Daily Advertiser,” asserts that the mortality among\r\nhis patients is only one per cent. since he has practised Homoeopathy,\r\nwhereas it was six per cent. when he employed the common mode of\r\npractice, I am convinced by this, his own statement, that the citizens\r\nof Brunswick, whenever they are seriously sick, take good care not to\r\nsend for Dr. Muhlenbein!\r\n\r\nIt is evidently impossible that I should attempt, within the compass of\r\na single lecture, any detailed examination of the very numerous cases\r\nreported in the Homoeopathic Treatises and Journals. Having been in the\r\nhabit of receiving the French “Archives of Homoeopathic Medicine” until\r\nthe premature decease of that Journal, I have had the opportunity of\r\nbecoming acquainted somewhat with the style of these documents, and\r\nexperiencing whatever degree of conviction they were calculated to\r\nproduce. Although of course I do not wish any value to be assumed for my\r\nopinion, such as it is, I consider that you are entitled to hear it. So\r\nfar, then, as I am acquainted with the general character of the cases\r\nreported by the Homoeopathic physicians, they would for the most part\r\nbe considered as wholly undeserving a place in any English, French,\r\nor American periodical of high standing, if, instead of favoring the\r\ndoctrine they were intended to support, they were brought forward to\r\nprove the efficacy of any common remedy administered by any common\r\npractitioner. There are occasional exceptions to this remark; but the\r\ngeneral truth of it is rendered probable by the fact that these cases\r\nare always, or almost always, written with the single object of showing\r\nthe efficacy of the medicine used, or the skill of the practitioner, and\r\nit is recognized as a general rule that such cases deserve very little\r\nconfidence. Yet they may sound well enough, one at a time, to those who\r\nare not fully aware of the fallacies of medical evidence. Let me state\r\na case in illustration. Nobody doubts that some patients recover under\r\nevery form of practice. Probably all are willing to allow that a\r\nlarge majority, for instance, ninety in a hundred, of such cases as\r\na physician is called to in daily practice, would recover, sooner or\r\nlater, with more or less difficulty, provided nothing were done to\r\ninterfere seriously with the efforts of nature.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, a physician who has a hundred patients prescribes to\r\neach of them pills made of some entirely inert substance, as starch,\r\nfor instance. Ninety of them get well, or if he chooses to use such\r\nlanguage, he cures ninety of them. It is evident, according to the\r\ndoctrine of chances, that there must be a considerable number of\r\ncoincidences between the relief of the patient and the administration\r\nof the remedy. It is altogether probable that there will happen two or\r\nthree very striking coincidences out of the whole ninety cases, in which\r\nit would seem evident that the medicine produced the relief, though\r\nit had, as we assumed, nothing to do with it. Now suppose that the\r\nphysician publishes these cases, will they not have a plausible\r\nappearance of proving that which, as we granted at the outset, was\r\nentirely false? Suppose that instead of pills of starch he employs\r\nmicroscopic sugarplums, with the five' million billion trillionth\r\npart of a suspicion of aconite or pulsatilla, and then publishes his\r\nsuccessful cases, through the leaden lips of the press, or the living\r\nones of his female acquaintances,--does that make the impression a less\r\nerroneous one? But so it is that in Homoeopathic works and journals and\r\ngossip one can never, or next to never, find anything but successful\r\ncases, which might do very well as a proof of superior skill, did it not\r\nprove as much for the swindling advertisers whose certificates disgrace\r\nso many of our newspapers. How long will it take mankind to learn that\r\nwhile they listen to “the speaking hundreds and units,” who make the\r\nworld ring with the pretended triumphs they have witnessed, the “dumb\r\nmillions” of deluded and injured victims are paying the daily forfeit of\r\ntheir misplaced confidence!\r\n\r\nI am sorry to see, also, that a degree of ignorance as to the natural\r\ncourse of diseases is often shown in these published cases, which,\r\nalthough it may not be detected by the unprofessional reader, conveys an\r\nunpleasant impression to those who are acquainted with the subject. Thus\r\na young woman affected with jaundice is mentioned in the German “Annals\r\nof Clinical Homoeopathy” as having been cured in twenty-nine days by\r\npulsatilla and nux vomica. Rummel, a well-known writer of the same\r\nschool, speaks of curing a case of jaundice in thirty-four days by\r\nHomoeopathic doses of pulsatilla, aconite, and cinchona. I happened to\r\nhave a case in my own household, a few weeks since, which lasted about\r\nten days, and this was longer than I have repeatedly seen it in hospital\r\npractice, so that it was nothing to boast of.\r\n\r\nDr. Munneche of Lichtenburg in Saxony is called to a patient with\r\nsprained ankle who had been a fortnight under the common treatment. The\r\npatient gets well by the use of arnica in a little more than a month\r\nlonger, and this extraordinary fact is published in the French “Archives\r\nof Homoeopathic Medicine.”\r\n\r\nIn the same Journal is recorded the case of a patient who with nothing\r\nmore, so far as any proof goes, than influenza, gets down to her shop\r\nupon the sixth day.\r\n\r\nAnd again, the cool way in which everything favorable in a case is set\r\ndown by these people entirely to their treatment, may be seen in a case\r\nof croup reported in the “Homoeopathic Gazette” of Leipsic, in which\r\nleeches, blistering, inhalation of hot vapor, and powerful internal\r\nmedicine had been employed, and yet the merit was all attributed to one\r\ndrop of some Homoeopathic fluid.\r\n\r\nI need not multiply these quotations, which illustrate the grounds of\r\nan opinion which the time does not allow me to justify more at length;\r\nother such cases are lying open before me; there is no end to them if\r\nmore were wanted; for nothing is necessary but to look into any of the\r\nnumerous broken-down Journals of Homoeopathy, the volumes of which may\r\nbe found on the shelves of those curious in such matters.\r\n\r\nA number of public trials of Homoeopathy have been made in different\r\nparts of the world. Six of these are mentioned in the Manifesto of the\r\n“Homoeopathic Examiner.” Now to suppose that any trial can absolutely\r\nsilence people, would be to forget the whole experience of the past.\r\nDr. Haygarth and Dr. Alderson could not stop the sale of the five-guinea\r\nTractors, although they proved that they could work the same miracles\r\nwith pieces of wood and tobacco-pipe. It takes time for truth to operate\r\nas well as Homoeopathic globules. Many persons thought the results of\r\nthese trials were decisive enough of the nullity of the treatment; those\r\nwho wish to see the kind of special pleading and evasion by which it is\r\nattempted to cover results which, stated by the “Homoeopathic Examiner”\r\n itself, look exceedingly like a miserable failure, may consult the\r\nopening flourish of that Journal. I had not the intention to speak of\r\nthese public trials at all, having abundant other evidence on the point.\r\nBut I think it best, on the whole, to mention two of them in a few\r\nwords,--that instituted at Naples and that of Andral.\r\n\r\nThere have been few names in the medical profession, for the last half\r\ncentury, so widely known throughout the world of science as that of M.\r\nEsquirol, whose life was devoted to the treatment of insanity, and who\r\nwas without a rival in that department of practical medicine. It is from\r\nan analysis communicated by him to the “Gazette Medicale de Paris” that\r\nI derive my acquaintance with the account of the trial at Naples by Dr.\r\nPanvini, physician to the Hospital della Pace. This account seems to\r\nbe entirely deserving of credit. Ten patients were set apart, and not\r\nallowed to take any medicine at all,--much against the wish of the\r\nHomoeopathic physician. All of them got well, and of course all of them\r\nwould have been claimed as triumphs if they had been submitted to the\r\ntreatment. Six other slight cases (each of which is specified) got well\r\nunder the Homoeopathic treatment, none of its asserted specific effects\r\nbeing manifested.\r\n\r\nAll the rest were cases of grave disease; and so far as the trial, which\r\nwas interrupted about the fortieth day, extended, the patients grew\r\nworse, or received no benefit. A case is reported on the page before\r\nme of a soldier affected with acute inflammation in the chest, who took\r\nsuccessively aconite, bryonia, nux vomica, and pulsatilla, and after\r\nthirty-eight days of treatment remained without any important change in\r\nhis disease. The Homoeopathic physician who treated these patients was\r\nM. de Horatiis, who had the previous year been announcing his wonderful\r\ncures. And M. Esquirol asserted to the Academy of Medicine in 1835,\r\nthat this M. de Horatiis, who is one of the prominent personages in the\r\n“Examiner's” Manifesto published in 1840, had subsequently renounced\r\nHomoeopathy. I may remark, by the way, that this same periodical, which\r\nis so very easy in explaining away the results of these trials, makes a\r\nmistake of only six years or a little more as to the time when this at\r\nNaples was instituted.\r\n\r\nM. Andral, the “eminent and very enlightened allopathist” of the\r\n“Homoeopathic Examiner,” made the following statement in March, 1835, to\r\nthe Academy of Medicine: “I have submitted this doctrine to experiment;\r\nI can reckon at this time from one hundred and thirty to one hundred and\r\nforty cases, recorded with perfect fairness, in a great hospital, under\r\nthe eye of numerous witnesses; to avoid every objection--I obtained my\r\nremedies of M. Guibourt, who keeps a Homoeopathic pharmacy, and whose\r\nstrict exactness is well known; the regimen has been scrupulously\r\nobserved, and I obtained from the sisters attached to the hospital a\r\nspecial regimen, such as Hahnemann orders. I was told, however, some\r\nmonths since, that I had not been faithful to all the rules of the\r\ndoctrine. I therefore took the trouble to begin again; I have studied\r\nthe practice of the Parisian Homoeopathists, as I had studied their\r\nbooks, and I became convinced that they treated their patients as I had\r\ntreated mine, and I affirm that I have been as rigorously exact in the\r\ntreatment as any other person.”\r\n\r\nAnd he expressly asserts the entire nullity of the influence of all\r\nthe Homoeopathic remedies tried by him in modifying, so far as he could\r\nobserve, the progress or termination of diseases. It deserves notice\r\nthat he experimented with the most boasted substances,--cinchona,\r\naconite, mercury, bryonia, belladonna. Aconite, for instance, he says\r\nhe administered in more than forty cases of that collection of feverish\r\nsymptoms in which it exerts so much power, according to Hahnemann, and\r\nin not one of them did it have the slightest influence, the pulse and\r\nheat remaining as before.\r\n\r\nThese statements look pretty honest, and would seem hard to be explained\r\naway, but it is calmly said that he “did not know enough of the method\r\nto select the remedies with any tolerable precision.” [“Homoeopathic\r\nExaminer, vol. i. p. 22.]\r\n\r\n“Nothing is left to the caprice of the physician.” (In a word, instead\r\nof being dependent upon blind chance, that there is an infallible\r\nlaw, guided by which; the physician MUST select the proper remedies.')\r\n['Ibid.,' in a notice of Menzel's paper.] Who are they that practice\r\nHomoeopathy, and say this of a man with the Materia Medica of Hahnemann\r\nlying before him? Who are they that send these same globules, on which\r\nhe experimented, accompanied by a little book, into families, whose\r\nmembers are thought competent to employ them, when they deny any such\r\ncapacity to a man whose life has been passed at the bedside of patients,\r\nthe most prominent teacher in the first Medical Faculty in the world,\r\nthe consulting physician of the King of France, and one of the most\r\nrenowned practical writers, not merely of his nation, but of his age?\r\nI leave the quibbles by which such persons would try to creep out from\r\nunder the crushing weight of these conclusions to the unfortunates who\r\nsuppose that a reply is equivalent to an answer.\r\n\r\nDr. Baillie, one of the physicians in the great Hotel Dieu of Paris,\r\ninvited two Homoeopathic practitioners to experiment in his wards. One\r\nof these was Curie, now of London, whose works are on the counters\r\nof some of our bookstores, and probably in the hands of some of my\r\naudience. This gentleman, whom Dr. Baillie declares to be an enlightened\r\nman, and perfectly sincere in his convictions, brought his own medicines\r\nfrom the pharmacy which furnished Hahnemann himself, and employed them\r\nfor four or five months upon patients in his ward, and with results\r\nequally unsatisfactory, as appears from Dr. Baillie's statement at\r\na meeting of the Academy of Medicine. And a similar experiment was\r\npermitted by the Clinical Professor of the Hotel Dieu of Lyons, with the\r\nsame complete failure.\r\n\r\nBut these are old and prejudiced practitioners. Very well, then take the\r\nstatement of Dr. Fleury, a most intelligent young physician, who treated\r\nhomoeopathically more than fifty patients, suffering from diseases\r\nwhich it was not dangerous to treat in this way, taking every kind of\r\nprecaution as to regimen, removal of disturbing influences, and the\r\nstate of the atmosphere, insisted upon by the most vigorous partisans\r\nof the doctrine, and found not the slightest effect produced by the\r\nmedicines. And more than this, read nine of these cases, which he has\r\npublished, as I have just done, and observe the absolute nullity of\r\naconite, belladonna, and bryonia, against the symptoms over which they\r\nare pretended to exert such palpable, such obvious, such astonishing\r\ninfluences. In the view of these statements, it is impossible not to\r\nrealize the entire futility of attempting to silence this asserted\r\nscience by the flattest and most peremptory results of experiment. Were\r\nall the hospital physicians of Europe and America to devote themselves,\r\nfor the requisite period, to this sole pursuit, and were their results\r\nto be unanimous as to the total worthlessness of the whole system in\r\npractice, this slippery delusion would slide through their fingers\r\nwithout the slightest discomposure, when, as they supposed, they had\r\ncrushed every joint in its tortuous and trailing body.\r\n\r\n3. I have said, that to show the truth of the Homoeopathic doctrine,\r\nas announced by Hahnemann, it would be necessary to show, in the third\r\nplace, that remedies never cure diseases when they are not capable of\r\nproducing similar symptoms! The burden of this somewhat comprehensive\r\ndemonstration lying entirely upon the advocates of this doctrine, it may\r\nbe left to their mature reflections.\r\n\r\nIt entered into my original plan to treat of the doctrine relating to\r\nPsora, or itch,--an almost insane conception, which I am glad to get rid\r\nof, for this is a subject one does not care to handle without gloves. I\r\nam saved this trouble, however, by finding that many of the disciples\r\nof Hahnemann, those disciples the very gospel of whose faith stands upon\r\nhis word, make very light of his authority on this point, although he\r\nhimself says, “It has cost me twelve years of study and research to\r\ntrace out the source of this incredible number of chronic affections,\r\nto discover this great truth, which remained concealed from all\r\nmy predecessors and contemporaries, to establish the basis of its\r\ndemonstration, and find out, at the same time, the curative medicines\r\nthat were fit to combat this hydra in all its different forms.”\r\n\r\nBut, in the face of all this, the following remarks are made by Wolff,\r\nof Dresden, whose essays, according to the editor of the “Homoeopathic\r\nExaminer,” “represent the opinions of a large majority of Homoeopathists\r\nin Europe.”\r\n\r\n“It cannot be unknown to any one at all familiar with Homoeopathic\r\nliterature, that Hahnemann's idea of tracing the large majority of\r\nchronic diseases to actual itch has met with the greatest opposition\r\nfrom Homoeopathic physicians themselves.” And again, “If the Psoric\r\ntheory has led to no proper schism, the reason is to be found in the\r\nfact that it is almost without any influence in practice.”\r\n\r\nWe are told by Jahr, that Dr. Griesselich, “Surgeon to the Grand Duke\r\nof Baden,” and a “distinguished” Homoeopathist, actually asked Hahnemann\r\nfor the proof that chronic diseases, such as dropsy, for instance, never\r\narise from any other cause than itch; and that, according to common\r\nreport, the venerable sage was highly incensed (fort courrouce) with\r\nDr. Hartmann, of Leipsic, another “distinguished” Homoeopathist, for\r\nmaintaining that they certainly did arise from other causes.\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Fielitz, in the “Homoeopathic Gazette” of Leipsic, after saying,\r\nin a good-natured way, that Psora is the Devil in medicine, and that\r\nphysicians are divided on this point into diabolists and exorcists,\r\ndeclares that, according to a remark of Hahnemann, the whole civilized\r\nworld is affected with Psora. I must therefore disappoint any advocate\r\nof Hahnemann who may honor me with his presence, by not attacking a\r\ndoctrine on which some of the disciples of his creed would be very happy\r\nto have its adversaries waste their time and strength. I will not meddle\r\nwith this excrescence, which, though often used in time of peace, would\r\nbe dropped, like the limb of a shell-fish, the moment it was assailed;\r\ntime is too precious, and the harvest of living extravagances nods too\r\nheavily to my sickle, that I should blunt it upon straw and stubble.\r\n\r\nI will close the subject with a brief examination of some of the\r\nstatements made in Homoeopathic works, and more particularly in the\r\nbrilliant Manifesto of the “Examiner,” before referred to. And first, it\r\nis there stated under the head of “Homoeopathic Literature,” that\r\n“SEVEN HUNDRED volumes have been issued from the press developing the\r\npeculiarities of the system, and many of them possessed of a scientific\r\ncharacter that savans know well how to respect.” If my assertion were\r\nproper evidence in the case, I should declare, that, having seen a good\r\nmany of these publications, from the year 1834, when I bought the work\r\nof the Rev. Thomas Everest, [Dr. Curie speaks of this silly pamphlet as\r\nhaving been published in 1835.] to within a few weeks, when I received\r\nmy last importation of Homaeopathic literature, I have found that all,\r\nwith a very few exceptions, were stitched pamphlets varying from\r\ntwenty or thirty pages to somewhat less than a hundred, and generally\r\nresembling each other as much as so many spelling-books.\r\n\r\nBut not being evidence in the case, I will give you the testimony of\r\nDr. Trinks, of Dresden, who flourishes on the fifteenth page of the same\r\nManifesto as one of the most distinguished among the Homoeopathists\r\nof Europe. I translate the sentence literally from the “Archives de la\r\nMedecine Homoeopathique.”\r\n\r\n“The literature of Homoeopathy, if that honorable name must be applied\r\nto all kinds of book-making, has been degraded to the condition of the\r\nhumblest servitude. Productions without talent, without spirit, without\r\ndiscrimination, flat and pitiful eulogies, exaggerations surpassing the\r\nlimits of the most robust faith, invectives against such as dared to\r\ndoubt the dogmas which had been proclaimed, or catalogues of remedies;\r\nof such materials is it composed! From distance to distance only, have\r\nappeared some memoirs useful to science or practice, which appear as so\r\nmany green oases in the midst of this literary desert.”\r\n\r\nIt is a very natural as well as a curious question to ask, What has been\r\nthe success of Homoeopathy in the different countries of Europe, and\r\nwhat is its present condition?\r\n\r\nThe greatest reliance of the advocates of Homoeopathy is of course\r\non Germany. We know very little of its medical schools, its medical\r\ndoctrines, or its medical men, compared with those of England and\r\nFrance. And, therefore, when an intelligent traveller gives a direct\r\naccount from personal inspection of the miserable condition of the\r\nHomoeopathic hospital at Leipsic, the first established in Europe, and\r\nthe first on the list of the ever-memorable Manifesto, it is easy enough\r\nanswer or elude the fact by citing various hard names of “distinguished”\r\n practitioners, which sound just as well to the uninformed public as if\r\nthey were Meckel, or Tiedemann, or Langenbeck. Dr. Leo-Wolf, who, to be\r\nsure, is opposed to Homoeopathy, but who is a scholar, and ought to know\r\nsomething of his own countrymen, assures us that “Dr. Kopp is the only\r\nGerman Homoeopathist, if we can call him so, who has been distinguished\r\nas an author and practitioner before he examined this method.” And Dr.\r\nLee, the same gentleman in whose travels the paragraph relating to\r\nthe Leipsic Hospital is to be found, says the same thing. And I will\r\ncheerfully expose myself to any impertinent remark which it might\r\nsuggest, to assure my audience that I never heard or saw one authentic\r\nHomoeopathic name of any country in Europe, which I had ever heard\r\nmentioned before as connected with medical science by a single word or\r\ndeed sufficient to make it in any degree familiar to my ears, unless\r\nArnold of Heidelberg is the anatomist who discovered a little nervous\r\ncentre, called the otic ganglion. But you need ask no better proof of\r\nwho and what the German adherents of this doctrine must be, than the\r\ntestimony of a German Homoeopathist as to the wretched character of the\r\nworks they manufacture to enforce its claims.\r\n\r\nAs for the act of this or that government tolerating or encouraging\r\nHomoeopathy, every person of common intelligence knows that it is a mere\r\nform granted or denied according to the general principles of policy\r\nadopted in different states, or the degree of influence which some few\r\npersons who have adopted it may happen to have at court. What may be\r\nthe value of certain pompous titles with which many of the advocates of\r\nHomoeopathy are honored, it might be disrespectful to question. But in\r\nthe mean time the judicious inquirer may ponder over an extract which\r\nI translate from a paper relating to a personage well known to the\r\ncommunity as Williams the Oculist, with whom I had the honor of crossing\r\nthe Atlantic some years since, and who himself handed me two copies of\r\nthe paper in question.\r\n\r\n“To say that he was oculist of Louis XVIII. and of Charles X., and\r\nthat he now enjoys the same title with respect to His Majesty, Louis\r\nPhilippe, and the King of the Belgians, is unquestionably to say a great\r\ndeal; and yet it is one of the least of his titles to public confidence.\r\nHis reputation rests upon a basis more substantial even than the\r\nnumerous diplomas with which he is provided, than the membership of the\r\ndifferent medical societies which have chosen him as their associate,”\r\n etc., etc.\r\n\r\nAnd as to one more point, it is time that the public should fully\r\nunderstand that the common method of supporting barefaced imposture\r\nat the present day, both in Europe and in this country, consists in\r\ntrumping up “Dispensaries,” “Colleges of Health,” and other advertising\r\ncharitable clap-traps, which use the poor as decoy-ducks for the rich,\r\nand the proprietors of which have a strong predilection for the title\r\nof “Professor.” These names, therefore, have come to be of little or\r\nno value as evidence of the good character, still less of the high\r\npretensions of those who invoke their authority. Nor does it\r\nfollow, even when a chair is founded in connection with a well-known\r\ninstitution, that it has either a salary or an occupant; so that it may\r\nbe, and probably is, a mere harmless piece of toleration on the part of\r\nthe government if a Professorship of Homoeopathy is really in existence\r\nat Jena or Heidelberg. And finally, in order to correct the error of any\r\nwho might suppose that the whole Medical Profession of Germany has long\r\nsince fallen into the delusions of Hahnemann, I will quote two lines\r\nwhich a celebrated anatomist and surgeon (whose name will occur again in\r\nthis lecture in connection with a very pleasing letter) addressed to the\r\nFrench Academy of Medicine in 1835. “I happened to be in Germany some\r\nmonths since, at a meeting of nearly six hundred physicians; one of\r\nthem wished to bring up the question of Homoeopathy; they would not even\r\nlisten to him.” This may have been very impolite and bigoted, but\r\nthat is not precisely the point in reference to which I mention the\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nBut if we cannot easily get at Germany, we can very easily obtain exact\r\ninformation from France and England. I took the trouble to write some\r\nmonths ago to two friends in Paris, in whom I could place confidence,\r\nfor information upon the subject. One of them answered briefly to the\r\neffect that nothing was said about it. When the late Curator of the\r\nLowell Institute, at his request, asked about the works upon the\r\nsubject, he was told that they had remained a long time on the shelves\r\nquite unsalable, and never spoken of.\r\n\r\nThe other gentleman, [Dr. Henry T. Bigelow, now Professor of Surgery\r\nin Harvard University] whose name is well known to my audience, and who\r\nneeds no commendation of mine, had the kindness to procure for me many\r\npublications upon the subject, and some information which sets the whole\r\nmatter at rest, so far as Paris is concerned. He went directly to the\r\nBaillieres, the principal and almost the only publishers of all the\r\nHomoeopathic books and journals in that city. The following facts\r\nwere taken by him from the account-books of this publishing firm. Four\r\nHomoeopathic Journals have been published in Paris; three of them by the\r\nBaillieres.\r\n\r\nThe reception they met with may be judged of by showing the number of\r\nsubscribers to each on the books of the publishing firm.\r\n\r\nA Review published by some other house, which lasted one year, and had\r\nabout fifty subscribers, appeared in 1834, 1835.\r\n\r\nThere were only four Journals of Homoeopathy ever published in Paris.\r\nThe Baillieres informed my correspondent that the sale of Homoeopathic\r\nbooks was much less than formerly, and that consequently they should\r\nundertake to publish no new books upon the subject, except those of Jahr\r\nor Hahnemann. “This man,” says my correspondent,--referring to one of\r\nthe brothers,--“the publisher and headquarters of Homoeopathy in Paris,\r\ninforms me that it is going down in England and Germany as well as\r\nin Paris.” For all the facts he had stated he pledged himself as\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nHomoeopathy was in its prime in Paris, he said, in 1836 and 1837, and\r\nsince then has been going down.\r\n\r\nLouis told my correspondent that no person of distinction in Paris had\r\nembraced Homoeopathy, and that it was declining. If you ask who Louis\r\nis, I refer you to the well-known Homoeopathist, Peschier of Geneva, who\r\nsays, addressing him, “I respect no one more than yourself; the feeling\r\nwhich guides your researches, your labors, and your pen, is so honorable\r\nand rare, that I could not but bow down before it; and I own, if there\r\nwere any allopathist who inspired me with higher veneration, it would be\r\nhim and not yourself whom I should address.”\r\n\r\nAmong the names of “Distinguished Homoeopathists,” however, displayed in\r\nimposing columns, in the index of the “Homoeopathic Examiner,” are those\r\nof MARJOLIN, AMUSSAT, and BRESCHET, names well known to the world of\r\nscience, and the last of them identified with some of the most valuable\r\ncontributions which anatomical knowledge has received since the\r\ncommencement of the present century. One Dr. Chrysaora, who stands\r\nsponsor for many facts in that Journal, makes the following statement\r\namong the rest: “Professors, who are esteemed among the most\r\ndistinguished of the Faculty (Faculty de Medicine), both as to knowledge\r\nand reputation, have openly confessed the power of Homoeopathia in\r\nforms of disease where the ordinary method of practice proved totally\r\ninsufficient. It affords me the highest pleasure to select from among\r\nthese gentlemen, Marjolin, Amussat, and Breschet.”\r\n\r\nHere is a literal translation of an original letter, now in my\r\npossession, from one of these Homoeopathists to my correspondent:--\r\n\r\n“DEAR SIR, AND RESPECTED PROFESSIONAL BROTHER:\r\n\r\n“You have had the kindness to inform me in your letter that a new\r\nAmerican Journal, the 'New World,' has made use of my name in support of\r\nthe pretended Homoeopathic doctrines, and that I am represented as one\r\nof the warmest partisans of Homoeopathy in France.\r\n\r\n“I am vastly surprised at the reputation manufactured for me upon the\r\nnew continent; but I am obliged, in deference to truth, to reject it\r\nwith my whole energy. I spurn far from me everything which relates to\r\nthat charlatanism called Homoeopathy, for these pretended doctrines\r\ncannot endure the scrutiny of wise and enlightened persons, who are\r\nguided by honorable sentiments in the practice of the noblest of arts.\r\n\r\n“PARIS, 3d November, 1841\r\n\r\n“I am, etc., etc.,\r\n\r\n“G. BRESCHET,\r\n\r\n“Professor in the Faculty of Medicine, Member of the Institute, Surgeon\r\nof Hotel Dieu, and Consulting Surgeon to the King, etc.” [I first saw M.\r\nBreschet's name mentioned in that Journal]\r\n\r\nConcerning Amussat, my correspondent writes, that he was informed by\r\nMadame Hahnemann, who converses in French more readily than her husband,\r\nand therefore often speaks for him, that “he was not a physician,\r\nneither Homoeopathist nor Allopathist, but that he was the surgeon\r\nof their own establishment; that is, performed as a surgeon all the\r\noperations they had occasion for in their practice.”\r\n\r\nI regret not having made any inquiries as to Marjolin, who, I doubt not,\r\nwould strike his ponderous snuff-box until it resounded like the Grecian\r\nhorse, at hearing such a doctrine associated with his respectable name.\r\nI was not aware, when writing to Paris, that this worthy Professor,\r\nwhose lectures I long attended, was included in these audacious claims;\r\nbut after the specimens I have given of the accuracy of the foreign\r\ncorrespondence of the “Homoeopathic Examiner,” any further information\r\nI might obtain would seem so superfluous as hardly to be worth the\r\npostage.\r\n\r\nHomoeopathy may be said, then, to be in a sufficiently miserable\r\ncondition in Paris. Yet there lives, and there has lived for years, the\r\nillustrious Samuel Hahnemann, who himself assured my correspondent that\r\nno place offered the advantages of Paris in its investigation, by reason\r\nof the attention there paid to it.\r\n\r\nIn England, it appears by the statement of Dr. Curie in October, 1839,\r\nabout eight years after its introduction into the country, that there\r\nwere eighteen Homoeopathic physicians in the United Kingdom, of whom\r\nonly three were to be found out of London, and that many of these\r\npractised Homoeopathy in secret.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that, according to the recent statement of\r\none of its leading English advocates, Homoeopathy had obtained not quite\r\nhalf as many practical disciples in England as Perkinism could show for\r\nitself in a somewhat less period from the time of its first promulgation\r\nin that country.\r\n\r\nDr. Curie's letter, dated London, October 30, 1839, says there is “one\r\nin Dublin, Dr. Luther; at Glasgow, Dr. Scott.” The “distinguished”\r\n Chrysaora writes from Paris, dating October 20, 1839, “On the other\r\nhand, Homoeopathy is commencing to make an inroad into England by\r\nthe way of Ireland. At Dublin, distinguished physicians have already\r\nembraced the new system, and a great part of the nobility and gentry\r\nof that city have emancipated themselves from the English fashion and\r\nprofessional authority.”\r\n\r\nBut the Marquis of Anglesea and Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer patronize\r\nHomoeopathy; the Queen Dowager Adelaide has been treated by a\r\nHomoeopathic physician. “Jarley is the delight of the nobility and\r\ngentry.” “The Royal Family are the patrons of Jarley.”\r\n\r\nLet me ask if a Marquis and a Knight are better than two Lords, and\r\nif the Dowager of Royalty is better than Royalty itself, all of which\r\nillustrious dignities were claimed in behalf of Benjamin Douglass\r\nPerkins?\r\n\r\nBut if the balance is thought too evenly suspended in this case, another\r\ninstance can be given in which the evidence of British noblemen and\r\ntheir ladies is shown to be as valuable in establishing the character of\r\na medical man or doctrine, as would be the testimony of the Marquis of\r\nWaterford concerning the present condition and prospects of missionary\r\nenterprise. I have before me an octavo volume of more than four hundred\r\npages, in which, among much similar matter, I find highly commendatory\r\nletters from the Marchioness of Ormond, Lady Harriet Kavanagh, the\r\nCountess of Buckinghamshire, the Right Hon. Viscount Ingestre, M. P.,\r\nand the Most Noble, the Marquis of Sligo,--all addressed to “John\r\nSt. John Long, Esq,” a wretched charlatan, twice tried for, and once\r\nconvicted of, manslaughter at the Old Bailey.\r\n\r\nThis poor creature, too, like all of his tribe, speaks of the medical\r\nprofession as a great confederation of bigoted monopolists. He, too,\r\nsays that “If an innovator should appear, holding out hope to those\r\nin despair, and curing disorders which the faculty have recorded as\r\nirremediable, he is at once, and without inquiry, denounced as an\r\nempiric and an impostor.” He, too, cites the inevitable names of Galileo\r\nand Harvey, and refers to the feelings excited by the great discovery of\r\nJenner. From the treatment of the great astronomer who was visited with\r\nthe punishment of other heretics by the ecclesiastical authorities of a\r\nCatholic country some centuries since, there is no very direct inference\r\nto be drawn to the medical profession of the present time. His name\r\nshould be babbled no longer, after having been placarded for the\r\nhundredth time in the pages of St. John Long. But if we are doomed\r\nto see constant reference to the names of Harvey and Jenner in every\r\nworthless pamphlet containing the prospectus of some new trick upon the\r\npublic, let us, once for all, stare the facts in the face, and see how\r\nthe discoveries of these great men were actually received by the medical\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nIn 1628, Harvey published his first work upon the circulation. His\r\ndoctrines were a complete revolution of the prevailing opinions of all\r\nantiquity. They immediately found both champions and opponents; of\r\nwhich last, one only, Riolanus, seemed to Harvey worthy of an answer, on\r\naccount of his “rank, fame, and learning.” Controversy in science, as in\r\nreligion, was not, in those days, carried on with all the courtesy which\r\nour present habits demand, and it is possible that some hard words may\r\nhave been applied to Harvey, as it is very certain that he used the most\r\ncontemptuous expressions towards others.\r\n\r\nHarvey declares in his second letter to Riolanus, “Since the first\r\ndiscovery of the circulation, hardly a day, or a moment, has passed\r\nwithout my hearing it both well and ill spoken of; some attack it with\r\ngreat hostility, others defend it with high encomiums; one party believe\r\nthat I have abundantly proved the truth of the doctrine against all\r\nthe weight of opposing arguments, by experiments, observations, and\r\ndissections; others think it not yet sufficiently cleared up, and free\r\nfrom objections.” Two really eminent Professors, Plempius of Louvain,\r\nand Walaeus of Leyden, were among its early advocates.\r\n\r\nThe opinions sanctioned by the authority of long ages, and the names of\r\nHippocrates and Galen, dissolved away, gradually, but certainly, before\r\nthe demonstrations of Harvey. Twenty-four years after the publication of\r\nhis first work, and six years before his death, his bust in marble\r\nwas placed in the Hall of the College of Physicians, with a suitable\r\ninscription recording his discoveries.\r\n\r\nTwo years after this he was unanimously invited to accept the Presidency\r\nof that body; and he lived to see his doctrine established, and all\r\nreputable opposition withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThere were many circumstances connected with the discovery of Dr. Jenner\r\nwhich were of a nature to excite repugnance and opposition. The practice\r\nof inoculation for the small-pox had already disarmed that disease of\r\nmany of its terrors. The introduction of a contagious disease from a\r\nbrute creature into the human system naturally struck the public mind\r\nwith a sensation of disgust and apprehension, and a part of the medical\r\npublic may have shared these feelings. I find that Jenner's discovery of\r\nvaccination was made public in June, 1798. In July of the same year the\r\ncelebrated surgeon, Mr. Cline, vaccinated a child with virus received\r\nfrom Dr. Jenner, and in communicating the success of this experiment,\r\nhe mentions that Dr. Lister, formerly of the Small-Pox Hospital, and\r\nhimself, are convinced of the efficacy of the cow-pox. In November\r\nof the same year, Dr. Pearson published his “Inquiry,” containing the\r\ntestimony of numerous practitioners in different parts of the kingdom,\r\nto the efficacy of the practice. Dr. HAYGARTH, who was so conspicuous\r\nin exposing the follies of Perkinism, was among the very earliest\r\nto express his opinion in favor of vaccination. In 1801, Dr. Lettsom\r\nmentions the circumstance “as being to the honor of the medical\r\nprofessors, that they have very generally encouraged this salutary\r\npractice, although it is certainly calculated to lessen their pecuniary\r\nadvantages by its tendency to extirpate a fertile source of professional\r\npractice.”\r\n\r\nIn the same year the Medical Committee of Paris spoke of vaccination in\r\na public letter, as “the most brilliant and most important discovery\r\nof the eighteenth century.” The Directors of a Society for the\r\nExtermination of the Small-Pox, in a Report dated October 1st, 1807,\r\n“congratulate the public on the very favorable opinion which the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians of London, after a most minute and laborious\r\ninvestigation made by the command of his Majesty, have a second time\r\nexpressed on the subject of vaccination, in their Report laid before the\r\nHouse of Commons, in the last session of Parliament; in consequence of\r\nwhich the sum of twenty thousand pounds was voted to Dr. Jenner, as\r\na remuneration for his discovery, in addition to ten thousand pounds\r\nbefore granted.” (In June, 1802.)\r\n\r\nThese and similar accusations, so often brought up against the Medical\r\nProfession, are only one mode in which is manifested a spirit of\r\nopposition not merely to medical science, but to all science, and to all\r\nsound knowledge. It is a spirit which neither understands itself nor the\r\nobject at which it is aiming. It gropes among the loose records of the\r\npast, and the floating fables of the moment, to glean a few truths or\r\nfalsehoods tending to prove, if they prove anything, that the persons\r\nwho have passed their lives in the study of a branch of knowledge\r\nthe very essence of which must always consist in long and accurate\r\nobservation, are less competent to judge of new doctrines in their own\r\ndepartment than the rest of the community. It belongs to the clown in\r\nsociety, the destructive in politics, and the rogue in practice.\r\n\r\nThe name of Harvey, whose great discovery was the legitimate result of\r\nhis severe training and patient study, should be mentioned only to check\r\nthe pretensions of presumptuous ignorance. The example of Jenner,\r\nwho gave his inestimable secret, the result of twenty-two years of\r\nexperiment and researches, unpurchased, to the public,--when, as was\r\nsaid in Parliament, he might have made a hundred thousand pounds by it\r\nas well as any smaller sum,--should be referred to only to rebuke the\r\nselfish venders of secret remedies, among whom his early history obliges\r\nus reluctantly to record Samuel Hahnemann. Those who speak of the great\r\nbody of physicians as if they were united in a league to support the\r\nsuperannuated notions of the past against the progress of improvement,\r\nhave read the history of medicine to little purpose. The prevalent\r\nfailing of this profession has been, on the contrary, to lend a too\r\ncredulous ear to ambitious and plausible innovators. If at the present\r\ntime ten years of public notoriety have passed over any doctrine\r\nprofessing to be of importance in medical science, and if it has not\r\nsucceeded in raising up a powerful body of able, learned, and ingenious\r\nadvocates for its claims, the fault must be in the doctrine and not in\r\nthe medical profession.\r\n\r\nHomoeopathy has had a still more extended period of trial than this,\r\nand we have seen with what results. It only remains to throw out a few\r\nconjectures as to the particular manner in which it is to break up and\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n1. The confidence of the few believers in this delusion will never\r\nsurvive the loss of friends who may die of any acute disease, under a\r\ntreatment such as that prescribed by Homoeopathy. It is doubtful how far\r\ncases of this kind will be trusted to its tender mercies, but wherever\r\nit acquires any considerable foothold, such cases must come, and with\r\nthem the ruin of those who practise it, should any highly valued life be\r\nthus sacrificed.\r\n\r\n2. After its novelty has worn out, the ardent and capricious individuals\r\nwho constitute the most prominent class of its patrons will return to\r\nvisible doses, were it only for the sake of a change.\r\n\r\n3. The Semi-Homoeopathic practitioner will gradually withdraw from\r\nthe rotten half of his business and try to make the public forget his\r\nconnection with it.\r\n\r\n4. The ultra Homoeopathist will either recant and try to rejoin the\r\nmedical profession; or he will embrace some newer and if possible\r\nequally extravagant doctrine; or he will stick to his colors and go\r\ndown with his sinking doctrine. Very few will pursue the course last\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nA single fact may serve to point out in what direction there will\r\nprobably be a movement of the dissolving atoms of Homoeopathy. On the\r\n13th page of the too frequently cited Manifesto of the “Examiner” I read\r\nthe following stately paragraph:\r\n\r\n“Bigelius, M. D., physician to the Emperor of Russia, whose elevated\r\nreputation is well known in Europe, has been an acknowledged advocate\r\nof Hahnemann's doctrines for several years. He abandoned Allopathia for\r\nHomoeopathia.” The date of this statement is January, 1840. I find on\r\nlooking at the booksellers' catalogues that one Bigel, or Bigelius,\r\nto speak more classically, has been at various times publishing\r\nHomoeopathic books for some years.\r\n\r\nAgain, on looking into the “Encyclographie des Sciences Medicales” for\r\nApril, 1840, I find a work entitled “Manual of HYDROSUDOPATHY, or the\r\nTreatment of Diseases by Cold Water, etc., etc., by Dr. Bigel, Physician\r\nof the School of Strasburg, Member of the Medico-Chirurgical Institute\r\nof Naples, of the Academy of St. Petersburg,--Assessor of the College of\r\nthe Empire of Russia, Physician of his late Imperial Highness the Grand\r\nDuke Constantine, Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, etc.” Hydrosudopathy\r\nor Hydropathy, as it is sometimes called, is a new medical doctrine or\r\npractice which has sprung up in Germany since Homoeopathy, which it\r\nbids fair to drive out of the market, if, as Dr. Bigel says, fourteen\r\nphysicians afflicted with diseases which defied themselves and their\r\ncolleagues came to Graefenberg, in the year 1836 alone, and were cured.\r\nNow Dr. Bigel, “whose elevated reputation is well known in Europe,”\r\n writes as follows: “The reader will not fail to see in this defence of\r\nthe curative method of Graefenberg a profession of medical faith, and\r\nhe will be correct in so doing.” And his work closes with the following\r\nsentence, worthy of so distinguished an individual: “We believe, with\r\nreligion, that the water of baptism purifies the soul from its original\r\nsin; let us believe also, with experience, that it is for our corporeal\r\nsins the redeemer of the human body.” If Bigel, Physician to the late\r\nGrand Duke Constantine, is identical with Bigel whom the “Examiner”\r\n calls Physician to the Emperor of Russia, it appears that he is now\r\nactively engaged in throwing cold water at once upon his patients and\r\nthe future prospects of Homoeopathy.\r\n\r\nIf, as must be admitted, no one of Hahnemann's doctrines is received\r\nwith tolerable unanimity among his disciples, except the central axiom,\r\nSimilia similibus curantur; if this axiom itself relies mainly for its\r\nsupport upon the folly and trickery of Hahnemann, what can we think of\r\nthose who announce themselves ready to relinquish all the accumulated\r\ntreasures of our art, to trifle with life upon the strength of these\r\nfantastic theories? What shall we think of professed practitioners of\r\nmedicine, if, in the words of Jahr, “from ignorance, for their personal\r\nconvenience, or through charlatanism, they treat their patients one\r\nday Homoeopathically and the next Allopathically;” if they parade their\r\npretended new science before the unguarded portion of the community;\r\nif they suffer their names to be coupled with it wherever it may gain a\r\ncredulous patient; and deny all responsibility for its character, refuse\r\nall argument for its doctrines, allege no palliation for the ignorance\r\nand deception interwoven with every thread of its flimsy tissue, when\r\nthey are questioned by those competent to judge and entitled to an\r\nanswer?\r\n\r\nSuch is the pretended science of Homoeopathy, to which you are asked to\r\ntrust your lives and the lives of those dearest to you. A mingled mass\r\nof perverse ingenuity, of tinsel erudition, of imbecile credulity, and\r\nof artful misrepresentation, too often mingled in practice, if we\r\nmay trust the authority of its founder, with heartless and shameless\r\nimposition. Because it is suffered so often to appeal unanswered to the\r\npublic, because it has its journals, its patrons, its apostles, some\r\nare weak enough to suppose it can escape the inevitable doom of utter\r\ndisgrace and oblivion. Not many years can pass away before the same\r\ncuriosity excited by one of Perkins's Tractors will be awakened at the\r\nsight of one of the Infinitesimal Globules. If it should claim a longer\r\nexistence, it can only be by falling into the hands of the sordid\r\nwretches who wring their bread from the cold grasp of disease and death\r\nin the hovels of ignorant poverty.\r\n\r\nAs one humble member of a profession which for more than two thousand\r\nyears has devoted itself to the pursuit of the best earthly interests\r\nof mankind, always assailed and insulted from without by such as are\r\nignorant of its infinite perplexities and labors, always striving in\r\nunequal contest with the hundred-armed giant who walks in the noonday,\r\nand sleeps not in the midnight, yet still toiling, not merely for itself\r\nand the present moment, but for the race and the future, I have lifted\r\nmy voice against this lifeless delusion, rolling its shapeless bulk into\r\nthe path of a noble science it is too weak to strike, or to injure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTAGIOUSNESS OF PUERPERAL FEVER\r\n\r\nPrinted in 1843; reprinted with additions, 1855.\r\n\r\nTHE POINT AT ISSUE. THE AFFIRMATIVE.\r\n\r\n“The disease known as Puerperal Fever is so far contagious as to be\r\nfrequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses.” O.\r\nW. Holmes, 1843.\r\n\r\nTHE NEGATIVE.\r\n\r\n“The result of the whole discussion will, I trust, serve, not only to\r\nexalt your views of the value and dignity of our profession, but to\r\ndivest your minds of the overpowering dread that you can ever become,\r\nespecially to woman, under the extremely interesting circumstances\r\nof gestation and parturition, the minister of evil; that you can ever\r\nconvey, in any possible manner, a horrible virus, so destructive in\r\nits effects, and so mysterious in its operations as that attributed to\r\npuerperal fever.”--Professor Hodge, 1852.\r\n\r\n“I prefer to attribute them to accident, or Providence, of which I can\r\nform a conception, rather than to a contagion of which I cannot form any\r\nclear idea, at least as to this particular malady.”--Professor Meigs,\r\n1852.\r\n\r\n“... in the propagation of which they have no more to do, than with the\r\npropagation of cholera from Jessore to San Francisco, and from Mauritius\r\nto St. Petersburg.”--Professor Meigs, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n          ---------------------\r\n\r\n“I arrived at that certainty in the matter, that I could venture to\r\nforetell what women would be affected with the disease, upon hearing by\r\nwhat midwife they were to be delivered, or by what nurse they were to\r\nbe attended, during their lying-in; and, almost in every instance, my\r\nprediction was verified.”--Gordon, 1795.\r\n\r\n“A certain number of deaths is caused every year by the contagion of\r\npuerperal fever, communicated by the nurses and medical attendants.”\r\n Farr, in Fifth Annual Report of Registrar-General of England, 1843.\r\n\r\n“... boards of health, if such exist, or, without them, the medical\r\ninstitutions of a country, should have the power of coercing, or of\r\ninflicting some kind of punishment on those who recklessly go from cases\r\nof puerperal fevers to parturient or puerperal females, without\r\nusing due precaution; and who, having been shown the risk, criminally\r\nencounter it, and convey pestilence and death to the persons they are\r\nemployed to aid in the most interesting and suffering period of female\r\nexistence.” --Copland's Medical Dictionary, Art. Puerperal States and\r\nDiseases, 1852.\r\n\r\n“We conceive it unnecessary to go into detail to prove the contagious\r\nnature of this disease, as there are few, if any, American practitioners\r\nwho do not believe in this doctrine.”--Dr. Lee, in Additions to Article\r\nlast cited.\r\n\r\n\r\n         -----------------------\r\n\r\n[INTRODUCTORY NOTE.] It happened, some years ago, that a discussion\r\narose in a Medical Society of which I was a member, involving the\r\nsubject of a certain supposed cause of disease, about which something\r\nwas known, a good deal suspected, and not a little feared. The\r\ndiscussion was suggested by a case, reported at the preceding meeting,\r\nof a physician who made an examination of the body of a patient who had\r\ndied with puerperal fever, and who himself died in less than a week,\r\napparently in consequence of a wound received at the examination, having\r\nattended several women in confinement in the mean time, all of whom, as\r\nit was alleged, were attacked with puerperal fever.\r\n\r\nWhatever apprehensions and beliefs were entertained, it was plain that\r\na fuller knowledge of the facts relating to the subject would be\r\nacceptable to all present. I therefore felt that it would be doing a\r\ngood service to look into the best records I could find, and inquire of\r\nthe most trustworthy practitioners I knew, to learn what experience\r\nhad to teach in the matter, and arrived at the results contained in the\r\nfollowing pages.\r\n\r\nThe Essay was read before the Boston Society for Medical Improvement,\r\nand, at the request of the Society, printed in the “New England\r\nQuarterly Journal of Medicine and Surgery” for April, 1843. As this\r\nJournal never obtained a large circulation, and ceased to be published\r\nafter a year's existence, and as the few copies I had struck off\r\nseparately were soon lost sight of among the friends to whom they were\r\nsent, the Essay can hardly be said to have been fully brought before the\r\nProfession.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this Paper has the same profound interest for me at\r\nthe present moment as it had when I was first collecting the terrible\r\nevidence out of which, as it seems to me, the commonest exercise of\r\nreason could not help shaping the truth it involved. It is not merely on\r\naccount of the bearing of the question,--if there is a question,--on all\r\nthat is most sacred in human life and happiness, that the subject cannot\r\nlose its interest. It is because it seems evident that a fair statement\r\nof the facts must produce its proper influence on a very large\r\nproportion of well-constituted and unprejudiced minds. Individuals may,\r\nhere and there, resist the practical bearing of the evidence on their\r\nown feelings or interests; some may fail to see its meaning, as some\r\npersons may be found who cannot tell red from green; but I cannot doubt\r\nthat most readers will be satisfied and convinced, to loathing, long\r\nbefore they have finished the dark obituary calendar laid before them.\r\n\r\nI do not know that I shall ever again have so good an opportunity of\r\nbeing useful as was granted me by the raising of the question which\r\nproduced this Essay. For I have abundant evidence that it has made many\r\npractitioners more cautious in their relations with puerperal females,\r\nand I have no doubt it will do so still, if it has a chance of being\r\nread, though it should call out a hundred counterblasts, proving to the\r\nsatisfaction of their authors that it proved nothing. And for my part, I\r\nhad rather rescue one mother from being poisoned by her attendant, than\r\nclaim to have saved forty out of fifty patients to whom I had carried\r\nthe disease. Thus, I am willing to avail myself of any hint coming from\r\nwithout to offer this paper once more to the press. The occasion\r\nhas presented itself, as will be seen, in a convenient if not in a\r\nflattering form.\r\n\r\nI send this Essay again to the MEDICAL PROFESSION, without the change\r\nof a word or syllable. I find, on reviewing it, that it anticipates and\r\neliminates those secondary questions which cannot be entertained for a\r\nmoment until the one great point of fact is peremptorily settled. In its\r\nvery statement of the doctrine maintained it avoids all discussion\r\nof the nature of the disease “known as puerperal fever,” and all the\r\nsomewhat stale philology of the word contagion. It mentions, fairly\r\nenough, the names of sceptics, or unbelievers as to the reality of\r\npersonal transmission; of Dewees, of Tonnelle, of Duges, of Baudelocque,\r\nand others; of course, not including those whose works were then\r\nunwritten or unpublished; nor enumerating all the Continental writers\r\nwho, in ignorance of the great mass of evidence accumulated by British\r\npractitioners, could hardly be called well informed on this subject. It\r\nmeets all the array of negative cases,--those in which disease did not\r\nfollow exposure,--by the striking example of small-pox, which,\r\nalthough one of the most contagious of diseases, is subject to the most\r\nremarkable irregularities and seeming caprices in its transmission. It\r\nmakes full allowance for other causes besides personal transmission,\r\nespecially for epidemic influences. It allows for the possibility\r\nof different modes of conveyance of the destructive principle. It\r\nrecognizes and supports the belief that a series of cases may originate\r\nfrom a single primitive source which affects each new patient in turn;\r\nand especially from cases of Erysipelas. It does not undertake to\r\ndiscuss the theoretical aspect of the subject; that is a secondary\r\nmatter of consideration. Where facts are numerous, and unquestionable,\r\nand unequivocal in their significance, theory must follow them as it\r\nbest may, keeping time with their step, and not go before them, marching\r\nto the sound of its own drum and trumpet. Having thus narrowed its area\r\nto a limited practical platform of discussion, a matter of life and\r\ndeath, and not of phrases or theories, it covers every inch of it with a\r\nmass of evidence which I conceive a Committee of Husbands, who can count\r\ncoincidences and draw conclusions as well as a Synod of Accoucheurs,\r\nwould justly consider as affording ample reasons for an unceremonious\r\ndismissal of a practitioner (if it is conceivable that such a step could\r\nbe waited for), after five or six funerals had marked the path of his\r\ndaily visits, while other practitioners were not thus escorted. To the\r\nProfession, therefore, I submit the paper in its original form, and\r\nleave it to take care of itself.\r\n\r\nTo the MEDICAL STUDENTS, into whose hands this Essay may fall, some\r\nwords of introduction may be appropriate, and perhaps, to a small number\r\nof them, necessary. There are some among them who, from youth, or want\r\nof training, are easily bewildered and confused in any conflict of\r\nopinions into which their studies lead them. They are liable to lose\r\nsight of the main question in collateral issues, and to be run away with\r\nby suggestive speculations. They confound belief with evidence, often\r\ntrusting the first because it is expressed with energy, and slighting\r\nthe latter because it is calm and unimpassioned. They are not satisfied\r\nwith proof; they cannot believe a point is settled so long as everybody\r\nis not silenced. They have not learned that error is got out of the\r\nminds that cherish it, as the taenia is removed from the body, one\r\njoint, or a few joints at a time, for the most part, rarely the whole\r\nevil at once. They naturally have faith in their instructors, turning to\r\nthem for truth, and taking what they may choose to give them; babes in\r\nknowledge, not yet able to tell the breast from the bottle, pumping away\r\nfor the milk of truth at all that offers, were it nothing better than a\r\nProfessor's shrivelled forefinger.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest and embryonic stage of professional development, any\r\nviolent impression on the instructor's mind is apt to be followed by\r\nsome lasting effect on that of the pupil. No mother's mark is more\r\npermanent than the mental naevi and moles, and excrescences, and\r\nmutilations, that students carry with them out of the lecture-room, if\r\nonce the teeming intellect which nourishes theirs has been scared from\r\nits propriety by any misshapen fantasy. Even an impatient or petulant\r\nexpression, which to a philosopher would be a mere index of the low\r\nstate of amiability of the speaker at the moment of its utterance, may\r\npass into the young mind as an element of its future constitution, to\r\ninjure its temper or corrupt its judgment. It is a duty, therefore,\r\nwhich we owe to this younger class of students, to clear any important\r\ntruth which may have been rendered questionable in their minds by such\r\nlanguage, or any truth-teller against whom they may have been prejudiced\r\nby hasty epithets, from the impressions such words have left. Until this\r\nis done, they are not ready for the question, where there is a question,\r\nfor them to decide. Even if we ourselves are the subjects of the\r\nprejudice, there seems to be no impropriety in showing that this\r\nprejudice is local or personal, and not an acknowledged conviction with\r\nthe public at large. It may be necessary to break through our usual\r\nhabits of reserve to do this, but this is the fault of the position in\r\nwhich others have placed us.\r\n\r\nTwo widely-known and highly-esteemed practitioners, Professors in two\r\nof the largest Medical Schools of the Union, teaching the branch of\r\nart which includes the Diseases of Women, and therefore speaking with\r\nauthority; addressing in their lectures and printed publications large\r\nnumbers of young men, many of them in the tenderest immaturity of\r\nknowledge, have recently taken ground in a formal way against the\r\ndoctrine maintained in this paper:\r\n\r\nOn the Non-Contagious Character of Puerperal Fever: An Introductory\r\nLecture. By Hugh L. Hodge, M. D., Professor of Obstetrics in the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Delivered Monday, October 11, 1852.\r\nPhiladelphia, 1852.\r\n\r\nOn the Nature, Signs, and Treatment of Childbed Fevers: in a Series of\r\nLetters addressed to the Students of his Class. By Charles D. Meigs,\r\nM. D., Professor of Midwifery and the Diseases of Women and Children in\r\nJefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, etc., etc. Philadelphia, 1854.\r\nLetter VI.\r\n\r\nThe first of the two publications, Dr. Hodge's Lecture, while its\r\ntheoretical considerations and negative experiences do not seem to me to\r\nrequire any further notice than such as lay ready for them in my Essay\r\nwritten long before, is, I am pleased to say, unobjectionable in tone\r\nand language, and may be read without offence.\r\n\r\nThis can hardly be said of the chapter of Dr. Meigs's volume which\r\ntreats of Contagion in Childbed Fever. There are expressions used in it\r\nwhich might well put a stop to all scientific discussions, were they\r\nto form the current coin in our exchange of opinions. I leave the “very\r\nyoung gentlemen,” whose careful expositions of the results of practice\r\nin more than six thousand cases are characterized as “the jejune and\r\nfizenless dreamings of sophomore writers,” to the sympathies of those\r\n“dear young friends,” and “dear young gentlemen,” who will judge how\r\nmuch to value their instructor's counsel to think for themselves,\r\nknowing what they are to expect if they happen not to think as he does.\r\n\r\nOne unpalatable expression I suppose the laws of construction oblige\r\nme to appropriate to myself, as my reward for a certain amount of labor\r\nbestowed on the investigation of a very important question of evidence,\r\nand a statement of my own practical conclusions. I take no offence, and\r\nattempt no retort. No man makes a quarrel with me over the counterpane\r\nthat covers a mother, with her new-born infant at her breast. There is\r\nno epithet in the vocabulary of slight and sarcasm that can reach my\r\npersonal sensibilities in such a controversy. Only just so far as a\r\ndisrespectful phrase may turn the student aside from the examination of\r\nthe evidence, by discrediting or dishonoring the witness, does it call\r\nfor any word of notice.\r\n\r\nI appeal from the disparaging language by which the Professor in the\r\nJefferson School of Philadelphia would dispose of my claims to be\r\nlistened to. I appeal, not to the vote of the Society for Medical\r\nImprovement, although this was an unusual evidence of interest in the\r\npaper in question, for it was a vote passed among my own townsmen; nor\r\nto the opinion of any American, for none know better than the Professors\r\nin the great Schools of Philadelphia how cheaply the praise of native\r\ncontemporary criticism is obtained. I appeal to the recorded opinions\r\nof those whom I do not know, and who do not know me, nor care for\r\nme, except for the truth that I may have uttered; to Copland, in his\r\n“Medical Dictionary,” who has spoken of my Essay in phrases to which\r\nthe pamphlets of American “scribblers” are seldom used from European\r\nauthorities; to Ramsbotham, whose compendious eulogy is all\r\nthat self-love could ask; to the “Fifth Annual Report” of the\r\nRegistrar-General of England, in which the second-hand abstract of\r\nmy Essay figures largely, and not without favorable comment, in an\r\nimportant appended paper. These testimonies, half forgotten until\r\nthis circumstance recalled them, are dragged into the light, not in a\r\nparoxysm of vanity, but to show that there may be food for thought in\r\nthe small pamphlet which the Philadelphia Teacher treats so lightly.\r\nThey were at least unsought for, and would never have been proclaimed\r\nbut for the sake of securing the privilege of a decent and unprejudiced\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nI will take it for granted that they have so far counterpoised the\r\ndepreciating language of my fellow-countryman and fellow-teacher as to\r\ngain me a reader here and there among the youthful class of students I\r\nam now addressing. It is only for their sake that I think it necessary\r\nto analyze, or explain, or illustrate, or corroborate any portion of\r\nthe following Essay. But I know that nothing can be made too plain for\r\nbeginners; and as I do not expect the practitioner, or even the more\r\nmature student, to take the trouble to follow me through an Introduction\r\nwhich I consider wholly unnecessary and superfluous for them, I shall\r\nnot hesitate to stoop to the most elementary simplicity for the benefit\r\nof the younger student. I do this more willingly because it affords a\r\ngood opportunity, as it seems to me, of exercising the untrained mind\r\nin that medical logic which does not seem to have been either taught or\r\npractised in our schools of late, to the extent that might be desired.\r\n\r\nI will now exhibit, in a series of propositions reduced to their\r\nsimplest expression, the same essential statements and conclusions as\r\nare contained in the Essay, with such commentaries and explanations as\r\nmay be profitable to the inexperienced class of readers addressed.\r\n\r\nI. It has been long believed, by many competent observers, that\r\nPuerperal Fever (so called) is sometimes carried from patient to patient\r\nby medical assistants.\r\n\r\nII. The express object of this Essay is to prove that it is so carried.\r\n\r\nIII. In order to prove this point, it is not necessary to consult\r\nany medical theorist as to whether or not it is consistent with his\r\npreconceived notions that such a mode of transfer should exist.\r\n\r\nIV. If the medical theorist insists on being consulted, and we see fit\r\nto indulge him, he cannot be allowed to assume that the alleged laws of\r\ncontagion, deduced from observation in other diseases, shall be cited\r\nto disprove the alleged laws deduced from observation in this. Science\r\nwould never make progress under such conditions. Neither the long\r\nincubation of hydrophobia, nor the protecting power of vaccination,\r\nwould ever have been admitted, if the results of observation in\r\nthese affections had been rejected as contradictory to the previously\r\nascertained laws of contagion.\r\n\r\nV. The disease in question is not a common one; producing, on the\r\naverage, about three deaths in a thousand births, according to the\r\nEnglish Registration returns which I have examined.\r\n\r\nVI. When an unusually large number of cases of this disease occur about\r\nthe same time, it is inferred, therefore, that there exists some special\r\ncause for this increased frequency. If the disease prevails extensively\r\nover a wide region of country, it is attributed without dispute to\r\nan epidemic influence. If it prevails in a single locality, as in a\r\nhospital, and not elsewhere, this is considered proof that some local\r\ncause is there active in its production.\r\n\r\nVII. When a large number of cases of this disease occur in rapid\r\nsuccession, in one individual's ordinary practice, and few or none\r\nelsewhere, these cases appearing in scattered localities, in patients of\r\nthe same average condition as those who escape under the care of others,\r\nthere is the same reason for connecting the cause of the disease with\r\nthe person in this instance, as with the place in that last mentioned.\r\n\r\nVIII. Many series of cases, answering to these conditions, are given\r\nin this Essay, and many others will be referred to which have occurred\r\nsince it was written.\r\n\r\nIX. The alleged results of observation may be set aside; first, because\r\nthe so-called facts are in their own nature equivocal; secondly, because\r\nthey stand on insufficient authority; thirdly, because they are not\r\nsufficiently numerous. But, in this case, the disease is one of striking\r\nand well-marked character; the witnesses are experts, interested in\r\ndenying and disbelieving the facts; the number of consecutive cases in\r\nmany instances frightful, and the number of series of cases such that I\r\nhave no room for many of them except by mere reference.\r\n\r\nX. These results of observation, being admitted, may, we will suppose,\r\nbe interpreted in different methods. Thus the coincidences may be\r\nconsidered the effect of chance. I have had the chances calculated by\r\na competent person, that a given practitioner, A., shall have sixteen\r\nfatal cases in a month, on the following data: A. to average attendance\r\nupon two hundred and fifty births in a year; three deaths in one\r\nthousand births to be assumed as the average from puerperal fever; no\r\nepidemic to be at the time prevailing. It follows, from the answer given\r\nme, that if we suppose every one of the five hundred thousand annual\r\nbirths of England to have been recorded during the last half-century,\r\nthere would not be one chance in a million million million millions that\r\none such series should be noted. No possible fractional error in this\r\ncalculation can render the chance a working probability. Applied to\r\ndozens of series of various lengths, it is obviously an absurdity.\r\nChance, therefore, is out of the question as an explanation of the\r\nadmitted coincidences.\r\n\r\nXI. There is, therefore, some relation of cause and effect between the\r\nphysician's presence and the patient's disease.\r\n\r\nXII. Until it is proved to what removable condition attaching to the\r\nattendant the disease is owing, he is bound to stay away from his\r\npatients so soon as he finds himself singled out to be tracked by the\r\ndisease. How long, and with what other precautions, I have suggested,\r\nwithout dictating, at the close of my Essay. If the physician does\r\nnot at once act on any reasonable suspicion of his being the medium of\r\ntransfer, the families where he is engaged, if they are allowed to know\r\nthe facts, should decline his services for the time. His feelings on the\r\noccasion, however interesting to himself, should not be even named in\r\nthis connection. A physician who talks about ceremony and gratitude, and\r\nservices rendered, and the treatment he got, surely forgets himself;\r\nit is impossible that he should seriously think of these small matters\r\nwhere there is even a question whether he may not carry disease, and\r\ndeath, and bereavement into any one of “his families,” as they are\r\nsometimes called.\r\n\r\nI will now point out to the young student the mode in which he may\r\nrelieve his mind of any confusion, or possibly, if very young, any\r\ndoubt, which the perusal of Dr. Meigs's Sixth Letter may have raised in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent ideas of the Letter are, first, that the\r\ntransmissible nature of puerperal fever appears improbable, and,\r\nsecondly, that it would be very inconvenient to the writer. Dr.\r\nWoodville, Physician to the Small-Pox and Inoculation Hospital in\r\nLondon, found it improbable, and exceedingly inconvenient to himself,\r\nthat cow pox should prevent small-pox; but Dr. Jenner took the liberty\r\nto prove the fact, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nI will first call the young student's attention to the show of negative\r\nfacts (exposure without subsequent disease), of which much seems to be\r\nthought. And I may at the same time refer him to Dr. Hodge's Lecture,\r\nwhere he will find the same kind of facts and reasoning. Let him now\r\ntake up Watson's Lectures, the good sense and spirit of which have made\r\nhis book a universal favorite, and open to the chapter on Continued\r\nFever. He will find a paragraph containing the following sentence: “A\r\nman might say, 'I was in the battle of Waterloo, and saw many men around\r\nme fall down and die, and it was said that they were struck down by\r\nmusket-balls; but I know better than that, for I was there all the\r\ntime, and so were many of my friends, and we were never hit by any\r\nmusket-balls. Musket-balls, therefore, could not have been the cause of\r\nthe deaths we witnessed.' And if, like contagion, they were not palpable\r\nto the senses, such a person might go on to affirm that no proof existed\r\nof there being any such thing as musket-balls.” Now let the student turn\r\nback to the chapter on Hydrophobia in the same volume. He will find that\r\nJohn Hunter knew a case in which, of twenty-one persons bitten, only one\r\ndied of the disease. He will find that one dog at Charenton was bitten\r\nat different times by thirty different mad dogs, and outlived it all.\r\nIs there no such thing, then, as hydrophobia? Would one take no especial\r\nprecautions if his wife, about to become a mother, had been bitten by a\r\nrabid animal, because so many escape? Or let him look at “Underwood on\r\nDiseases of Children,” [Philadelphia, 1842, p. 244, note.] and he will\r\nfind the case of a young woman who was inoculated eight times in thirty\r\ndays, at the same time attending several children with smallpox, and yet\r\nwas not infected. But seven weeks afterwards she took the disease and\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if the force of this argument could hardly fail to be\r\nseen, if it were granted that every one of these series of cases were so\r\nreported as to prove that there could have been no transfer of disease.\r\nThere is not one of them so reported, in the Lecture or the Letter, as\r\nto prove that the disease may not have been carried by the practitioner.\r\nI strongly suspect that it was so carried in some of these cases, but\r\nfrom the character of the very imperfect evidence the question can never\r\nbe settled without further disclosures.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Letter is, as I have implied, principally taken up with\r\nsecondary and collateral questions, and might therefore be set aside as\r\nin the main irrelevant, I am willing, for the student's sake, to touch\r\nsome of these questions briefly, as an illustration of its logical\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done, as I thought when I wrote my Essay, was\r\nto throw out all discussions of the word contagion, and this I did\r\neffectually by the careful wording of my statement of the subject to be\r\ndiscussed. My object was not to settle the etymology or definition of\r\na word, but to show that women had often died in childbed, poisoned in\r\nsome way by their medical attendants. On the other point, I, at least,\r\nhave no controversy with anybody, and I think the student will do well\r\nto avoid it in this connection. If I must define my position, however,\r\nas well as the term in question, I am contented with Worcester's\r\ndefinition; provided always this avowal do not open another side\r\ncontroversy on the merits of his Dictionary, which Dr. Meigs has not\r\ncited, as compared with Webster's, which he has.\r\n\r\nI cannot see the propriety of insisting that all the laws of the\r\neruptive fevers must necessarily hold true of this peculiar disease\r\nof puerperal women. If there were any such propriety, the laws of the\r\neruptive fevers must at least be stated correctly. It is not true,\r\nfor instance, as Dr. Meigs states, that contagion is “no respecter of\r\npersons;” that “it attacks all individuals alike.” To give one example:\r\nDr. Gregory, of the Small-Pox Hospital, who ought to know, says that\r\npersons pass through life apparently insensible to or unsusceptible of\r\nthe small-pox virus, and that the same persons do not take the vaccine\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAs to the short time of incubation, of which so much is made, we have\r\nno right to decide beforehand whether it shall be long or short, in the\r\ncases we are considering. A dissection wound may produce symptoms of\r\npoisoning in six hours; the bite of a rabid animal may take as many\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nAfter the student has read the case in Dr. Meigs's 136th paragraph, and\r\nthe following one, in which he exclaims against the idea of contagion,\r\nbecause the patient, delivered on the 26th of December, was attacked in\r\ntwenty-four hours, and died on the third day, let him read what happened\r\nat the “Black Assizes” of 1577 and 1750. In the first case, six hundred\r\npersons sickened the same night of the exposure, and three hundred more\r\nin three days. [Elliotson's Practice, p. 298.] Of those attacked in the\r\nlatter year, the exposure being on the 11th of May, Alderman Lambert\r\ndied on the 13th, Under-Sheriff Cox on the 14th, and many of note before\r\nthe 20th. But these are old stories. Let the student listen then to Dr.\r\nGerhard, whose reputation as a cautious observer he may be supposed to\r\nknow. “The nurse was shaving a man, who died in a few hours after his\r\nentrance; he inhaled his breath, which had a nauseous taste, and in an\r\nhour afterwards was taken with nausea, cephalalgia, and singing of the\r\nears. From that moment the attack began, and assumed a severe character.\r\nThe assistant was supporting another patient, who died soon afterwards;\r\nhe felt the pungent heat upon his skin, and was taken immediately with\r\nthe symptoms of typhus.” [Am. Jour. Med. Sciences, Feb. 1837, p. 299.]\r\nIt is by notes of cases, rather than notes of admiration, that we must\r\nbe guided, when we study the Revised Statutes of Nature, as laid down\r\nfrom the curule chairs of Medicine.\r\n\r\nLet the student read Dr. Meigs's 140th paragraph soberly, and then\r\nremember, that not only does he infer, suspect, and surmise, but he\r\nactually asserts (page 154), “there was poison in the house,” because\r\nthree out of five patients admitted into a ward had puerperal fever and\r\ndied. Have I not as much right to draw a positive inference from “Dr.\r\nA.'s” seventy exclusive cases as he from the three cases in the ward of\r\nthe Dublin Hospital? All practical medicine, and all action in common\r\naffairs, is founded on inferences. How does Dr. Meigs know that the\r\npatients he bled in puerperal fever would not have all got well if he\r\nhad not bled them?\r\n\r\n“You see a man discharge a gun at another; you see the flash, you hear\r\nthe report, you see the person fall a lifeless corpse; and you infer,\r\nfrom all these circumstances, that there was a ball discharged from the\r\ngun, which entered his body and caused his death, because such is the\r\nusual and natural cause of such an effect. But you did not see the ball\r\nleave the gun, pass through the air, and enter the body of the\r\nslain; and your testimony to the fact of killing is, therefore, only\r\ninferential,--in other words, circumstantial. It is possible that no\r\nball was in the gun; and we infer that there was, only because we cannot\r\naccount for death on any other supposition.” [Chief Justice Gibson, in\r\nAm. Law Journal, vol. vi. p. 123.]\r\n\r\n“The question always comes to this: Is the circumstance of intercourse\r\nwith the sick followed by the appearance of the disease in a proportion\r\nof cases so much greater than any other circumstance common to any\r\nportion of the inhabitants of the place under observation, as to make it\r\ninconceivable that the succession of cases occurring in persons having\r\nthat intercourse should have been the result of chance? If so, the\r\ninference is unavoidable, that that intercourse must have acted as a\r\ncause of the disease. All observations which do not bear strictly\r\non that point are irrelevant, and, in the case of an epidemic first\r\nappearing in a town or district, a succession of two cases is sometimes\r\nsufficient to furnish evidence which, on the principle I have stated, is\r\nnearly irresistible.”\r\n\r\nPossibly an inexperienced youth may be awe-struck by the quotation from\r\nCuvier. These words, or their equivalent, are certainly to be found in\r\nhis Introduction. So are the words “top not come down”! to be found in\r\nthe Bible, and they were as much meant for the ladies' head-dresses as\r\nthe words of Cuvier were meant to make clinical observation wait for a\r\npermit from anybody to look with its eyes and count on its fingers. Let\r\nthe inquiring youth read the whole Introduction, and he will see what\r\nthey mean.\r\n\r\nI intend no breach of courtesy, but this is a proper place to warn the\r\nstudent against skimming the prefaces and introductions of works for\r\nmottoes and embellishments to his thesis. He cannot learn anatomy by\r\nthrusting an exploring needle into the body. He will be very liable\r\nto misquote his author's meaning while he is picking off his outside\r\nsentences. He may make as great a blunder as that simple prince who\r\npraised the conductor of his orchestra for the piece just before the\r\noverture; the musician was too good a courtier to tell him that it was\r\nonly the tuning of the instruments.\r\n\r\nTo the six propositions in the 142d paragraph, and the remarks about\r\n“specific” diseases, the answer, if any is necessary, seems very simple.\r\nAn inflammation of a serous membrane may give rise to secretions which\r\nact as a poison, whether that be a “specific” poison or not, as Dr.\r\nHomer has told his young readers, and as dissectors know too well; and\r\nthat poison may produce its symptoms in a few hours after the system has\r\nreceived it, as any may see in Druitt's “Surgery,” if they care to look.\r\nPuerperal peritonitis may produce such a poison, and puerperal women may\r\nbe very sensible to its influences, conveyed by contact or exhalation.\r\nWhether this is so or not, facts alone can determine, and to facts we\r\nhave had recourse to settle it.\r\n\r\nThe following statement is made by Dr. Meigs in his 142d paragraph, and\r\ndeveloped more at length, with rhetorical amplifications, in the 134th.\r\n“No human being, save a pregnant or parturient woman, is susceptible to\r\nthe poison.” This statement is wholly incorrect, as I am sorry to have\r\nto point out to a Teacher in Dr. Meigs's position. I do not object to\r\nthe erudition which quotes Willis and Fernelius, the last of whom was\r\npleasantly said to have “preserved the dregs of the Arabs in the honey\r\nof his Latinity.” But I could wish that more modern authorities had not\r\nbeen overlooked. On this point, for instance, among the numerous facts\r\ndisproving the statement, the “American Journal of Medical Sciences,”\r\n published not far from his lecture-room, would have presented him with\r\na respectable catalog of such cases. Thus he might refer to Mr. Storrs's\r\npaper “On the Contagious Effects of Puerperal Fever on the Male Subject;\r\nor on Persons not Childbearing” (Jan. 1846), or to Dr. Reid's case\r\n(April, 1846), or to Dr. Barron's statement of the children's dying\r\nof peritonitis in an epidemic of puerperal fever at the Philadelphia\r\nHospital (Oct. 1842), or to various instances cited in Dr. Kneeland's\r\narticle (April, 186). Or, if he would have referred to the “New York\r\nJournal,” he might have seen Prof. Austin Flint's cases. Or, if he had\r\nhonored my Essay so far, he might have found striking instances of the\r\nsame kind in the first of the new series of cases there reported and\r\nelsewhere. I do not see the bearing of his proposition, if it were true.\r\nBut it is one of those assertions that fall in a moment before a slight\r\nexamination of the facts; and I confess my surprise, that a professor\r\nwho lectures on the Diseases of Women should have ventured to make it.\r\n\r\nNearly seven pages are devoted to showing that I was wrong in saying I\r\nwould not be “understood to imply that there exists a doubt in the mind\r\nof any well-informed member of the medical profession as to the fact\r\nthat puerperal fever is sometimes communicated from one person to\r\nanother, both directly and indirectly.” I will devote seven lines to\r\nthese seven pages, which seven lines, if I may say it without offence,\r\nare, as it seems to me, six more than are strictly necessary.\r\n\r\nThe following authors are cited as sceptics by Dr. Meigs: Dewees.--I\r\ncited the same passage. Did not know half the facts. Robert\r\nLee.--Believes the disease is sometimes communicable by contagion.\r\nTonnelle, Baudelocque. Both cited by me. Jacquemier.--Published three\r\nyears after my Essay. Kiwisch. “Behindhand in knowledge of Puerperal\r\nFever.” [B. & F. Med. Rev. Jan. 1842.] Paul Dubois.--Scanzoni.\r\n\r\nThese Continental writers not well informed on this point.[See Dr.\r\nSimpson's Remarks at Meeting of Edin. Med. Chir. Soc. (Am. Jour. Oct.\r\n1851.)]\r\n\r\nThe story of Von Busch is of interest and value, but there is nothing in\r\nit which need perplex the student. It is not pretended that the disease\r\nis always, or even, it may be, in the majority of cases, carried about\r\nby attendants; only that it is so carried in certain cases. That it may\r\nhave local and epidemic causes, as well as that depending on personal\r\ntransmission, is not disputed. Remember how small-pox often disappears\r\nfrom a community in spite of its contagious character, and the necessary\r\nexposure of many persons to those suffering from it; in both diseases\r\ncontagion is only one of the coefficients of the disease.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of the possibility that Dr. Meigs may have been\r\nthe medium of transfer of puerperal fever in some of the cases he has\r\nbriefly catalogued. Of Dr. Rutter's cases I do not know how to speak. I\r\nonly ask the student to read the facts stated by Dr. Condie, as given\r\nin my Essay, and say whether or not a man should allow his wife to be\r\nattended by a practitioner in whose hands “scarcely a female that has\r\nbeen delivered for weeks past has escaped an attack,” “while no instance\r\nof the disease has occurred in the patients of any other accoucheur\r\npractising in the same district.” If I understand Dr. Meigs and Dr.\r\nHodge, they would not warn the physician or spare the patient under such\r\ncircumstances. They would “go on,” if I understand them, not to seven,\r\nor seventy, only, but to seventy times seven, if they could find\r\npatients. If this is not what they mean, may we respectfully ask them to\r\nstate what they do mean, to their next classes, in the name of humanity,\r\nif not of science!\r\n\r\nI might repeat the question asked concerning Dr. Rutter's cases, with\r\nreference to those reported by Dr. Roberton. Perhaps, however, the\r\nstudent would like to know the opinion of a person in the habit of\r\nworking at matters of this kind in a practical point of view. To satisfy\r\nhim on this ground, I addressed the following question to the President\r\nof one of our principal Insurance Companies, leaving Dr. Meigs's book\r\nand my Essay in his hands at the same time.\r\n\r\nQuestion. “If such facts as Roberton's cases were before you, and the\r\nattendant had had ten, or even five fatal cases, or three, or two even,\r\nwould you, or would you not, if insuring the life of the next patient to\r\nbe taken care of by that attendant, expect an extra premium over that of\r\nan average case of childbirth?”\r\n\r\nAnswer. “Of course I should require a very large extra premium, if I\r\nwould take take risk at all.”\r\n\r\nBut I do not choose to add the expressions of indignation which the\r\nexamination of the facts before him called out. I was satisfied from the\r\neffect they produced on him, that if all the hideous catalogues of\r\ncases now accumulated were fully brought to the knowledge of the public,\r\nnothing, since the days of Burke and Hare, has raised such a cry of\r\nhorror as would be shrieked in the ears of the Profession.\r\n\r\nDr. Meigs has elsewhere invoked “Providence” as the alternative of\r\naccident, to account for the “coincidences.” (“Obstetrics,” Phil. 1852,\r\np. 631.) If so, Providence either acts through the agency of secondary\r\ncauses, as in other diseases, or not. If through such causes, let us\r\nfind out what they are, as we try to do in other cases. It may be true\r\nthat offences, or diseases, will come, but “woe unto him through whom\r\nthey come,” if we catch him in the voluntary or careless act of bringing\r\nthem! But if Providence does not act through secondary causes in this\r\nparticular sphere of etiology, then why does Dr. Meigs take such pains\r\nto reason so extensively about the laws of contagion, which, on that\r\nsupposition, have no more to do with this case than with the plague\r\nwhich destroyed the people after David had numbered them? Above all,\r\nwhat becomes of the theological aspect of the question, when he asserts\r\nthat a practitioner was “only unlucky in meeting with the epidemic\r\ncases?” (Op. cit. p. 633.) We do not deny that the God of battles\r\ndecides the fate of nations; but we like to have the biggest squadrons\r\non our side, and we are particular that our soldiers should not only say\r\ntheir prayers, but also keep their powder dry. We do not deny the agency\r\nof Providence in the disaster at Norwalk, but we turn off the engineer,\r\nand charge the Company five thousand dollars apiece for every life that\r\nis sacrificed.\r\n\r\nWhy a grand jury should not bring in a bill against a physician who\r\nswitches off a score of women one after the other along his private\r\ntrack, when he knows that there is a black gulf at the end of it, down\r\nwhich they are to plunge, while the great highway is clear, is more than\r\nI can answer. It is not by laying the open draw to Providence that he is\r\nto escape the charge of manslaughter.\r\n\r\nTo finish with all these lesser matters of question, I am unable to see\r\nwhy a female must necessarily be unattended in her confinement, because\r\nshe declines the services of a particular practitioner. In all the\r\nseries of cases mentioned, the death-carrying attendant was surrounded\r\nby others not tracked by disease and its consequences. Which, I would\r\nask, is worse,--to call in another, even a rival practitioner, or to\r\nsubmit an unsuspecting female to a risk which an Insurance Company would\r\nhave nothing to do with?\r\n\r\nI do not expect ever to return to this subject. There is a point of\r\nmental saturation, beyond which argument cannot be forced without\r\nbreeding impatient, if not harsh, feelings towards those who refuse to\r\nbe convinced. If I have so far manifested neither, it is well to stop\r\nhere, and leave the rest to those younger friends who may have more\r\nstomach for the dregs of a stale argument.\r\n\r\nThe extent of my prefatory remarks may lead some to think that I attach\r\ntoo much importance to my own Essay. Others may wonder that I should\r\nexpend so many words upon the two productions referred to, the Letter\r\nand the Lecture. I do consider my Essay of much importance so long as\r\nthe doctrine it maintains is treated as a question, and so long as any\r\nimportant part of the defence of that doctrine is thought to rest on\r\nits evidence or arguments. I cannot treat as insignificant any opinions\r\nbearing on life, and interests dearer than life, proclaimed yearly to\r\nhundreds of young men, who will carry them to their legitimate results\r\nin practice.\r\n\r\nThe teachings of the two Professors in the great schools of Philadelphia\r\nare sure to be listened to, not only by their immediate pupils, but by\r\nthe Profession at large. I am too much in earnest for either humility\r\nor vanity, but I do entreat those who hold the keys of life and death to\r\nlisten to me also for this once. I ask no personal favor; but I beg to\r\nbe heard in behalf of the women whose lives are at stake, until some\r\nstronger voice shall plead for them.\r\n\r\nI trust that I have made the issue perfectly distinct and intelligible.\r\nAnd let it be remembered that this is no subject to be smoothed over by\r\nnicely adjusted phrases of half-assent and half-censure divided between\r\nthe parties. The balance must be struck boldly and the result declared\r\nplainly. If I have been hasty, presumptuous, ill-informed, illogical; if\r\nmy array of facts means nothing; if there is no reason for any caution\r\nin the view of these facts; let me be told so on such authority that I\r\nmust believe it, and I will be silent henceforth, recognizing that my\r\nmind is in a state of disorganization. If the doctrine I have maintained\r\nis a mournful truth; if to disbelieve it, and to practise on this\r\ndisbelief, and to teach others so to disbelieve and practise, is to\r\ncarry desolation, and to charter others to carry it, into confiding\r\nfamilies, let it be proclaimed as plainly what is to be thought of the\r\nteachings of those who sneer at the alleged dangers, and scout the very\r\nidea of precaution. Let it be remembered that persons are nothing in\r\nthis matter; better that twenty pamphleteers should be silenced, or as\r\nmany professors unseated, than that one mother's life should be\r\ntaken. There is no quarrel here between men, but there is deadly\r\nincompatibility and exterminating warfare between doctrines.\r\nCoincidences meaning nothing, though a man have a monopoly of the\r\ndisease for weeks or months; or cause and effect, the cause being in\r\nsome way connected with the person; this is the question. If I am wrong,\r\nlet me be put down by such a rebuke as no rash declaimer has received\r\nsince there has been a public opinion in the medical profession of\r\nAmerica; if I am right, let doctrines which lead to professional\r\nhomicide be no longer taught from the chairs of those two great\r\nInstitutions. Indifference will not do here; our Journalists and\r\nCommittees have no right to take up their pages with minute anatomy\r\nand tediously detailed cases, while it is a question whether or not the\r\n“blackdeath” of child-bed is to be scattered broadcast by the agency of\r\nthe mother's friend and adviser. Let the men who mould opinions look to\r\nit; if there is any voluntary blindness, any interested oversight, any\r\nculpable negligence, even, in such a matter, and the facts shall reach\r\nthe public ear; the pestilence-carrier of the lying-in chamber must look\r\nto God for pardon, for man will never forgive him.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE CONTAGIOUSNESS OF PUERPERAL FEVER.\r\n\r\nIn collecting, enforcing, and adding to the evidence accumulated upon\r\nthis most serious subject, I would not be understood to imply that there\r\nexists a doubt in the mind of any well-informed member of the medical\r\nprofession as to the fact that puerperal fever is sometimes communicated\r\nfrom one person to another, both directly and indirectly. In the present\r\nstate of our knowledge upon this point I should consider such doubts\r\nmerely as a proof that the sceptic had either not examined the evidence,\r\nor, having examined it, refused to accept its plain and unavoidable\r\nconsequences. I should be sorry to think, with Dr. Rigby, that it was\r\na case of “oblique vision;” I should be unwilling to force home the\r\nargumentum ad hominem of Dr. Blundell, but I would not consent to make\r\na question of a momentous fact which is no longer to be considered as\r\na subject for trivial discussions, but to be acted upon with\r\nsilent promptitude. It signifies nothing that wise and experienced\r\npractitioners have sometimes doubted the reality of the danger in\r\nquestion; no man has the right to doubt it any longer. No negative\r\nfacts, no opposing opinions, be they what they may, or whose they may,\r\ncan form any answer to the series of cases now within the reach of all\r\nwho choose to explore the records of medical science.\r\n\r\nIf there are some who conceive that any important end would be answered\r\nby recording such opinions, or by collecting the history of all the\r\ncases they could find in which no evidence of the influence of contagion\r\nexisted, I believe they are in error. Suppose a few writers of authority\r\ncan be found to profess a disbelief in contagion,--and they are very few\r\ncompared with those who think differently,--is it quite clear that they\r\nformed their opinions on a view of all the facts, or is it not apparent\r\nthat they relied mostly on their own solitary experience? Still further,\r\nof those whose names are quoted, is it not true that scarcely a single\r\none could by any possibility have known the half or the tenth of the\r\nfacts bearing on the subject which have reached such a frightful amount\r\nwithin the last few years? Again, as to the utility of negative facts,\r\nas we may briefly call them,--instances, namely, in which exposure has\r\nnot been followed by disease,--although, like other truths, they may\r\nbe worth knowing, I do not see that they are like to shed any important\r\nlight upon the subject before us. Every such instance requires a good\r\ndeal of circumstantial explanation before it can be accepted. It is not\r\nenough that a practitioner should have had a single case of puerperal\r\nfever not followed by others. It must be known whether he attended\r\nothers while this case was in progress, whether he went directly from\r\none chamber to others, whether he took any, and what precautions. It is\r\nimportant to know that several women were exposed to infection\r\nderived from the patient, so that allowance may be made for want of\r\npredisposition. Now if of negative facts so sifted there could be\r\naccumulated a hundred for every one plain instance of communication here\r\nrecorded, I trust it need not be said that we are bound to guard and\r\nwatch over the hundredth tenant of our fold, though the ninety and\r\nnine may be sure of escaping the wolf at its entrance. If any one is\r\ndisposed, then, to take a hundred instances of lives endangered or\r\nsacrificed out of those I have mentioned, and make it reasonably clear\r\nthat within a similar time and compass ten thousand escaped the same\r\nexposure, I shall thank him for his industry, but I must be permitted to\r\nhold to my own practical conclusions, and beg him to adopt or at least\r\nto examine them also. Children that walk in calico before open fires are\r\nnot always burned to death; the instances to the contrary may be worth\r\nrecording; but by no means if they are to be used as arguments against\r\nwoollen frocks and high fenders.\r\n\r\nI am not sure that this paper will escape another remark which it might\r\nbe wished were founded in justice. It may be said that the facts are\r\ntoo generally known and acknowledged to require any formal argument or\r\nexposition, that there is nothing new in the positions advanced, and\r\nno need of laying additional statements before the Profession. But on\r\nturning to two works, one almost universally, and the other extensively\r\nappealed to as authority in this country, I see ample reason to\r\noverlook this objection. In the last edition of Dewees's Treatise on the\r\n“Diseases of Females,” it is expressly said, “In this country, under no\r\ncircumstance that puerperal fever has appeared hitherto, does it afford\r\nthe slightest ground for the belief that it is contagious.” In the\r\n“Philadelphia Practice of Midwifery” not one word can be found in the\r\nchapter devoted to this disease which would lead the reader to suspect\r\nthat the idea of contagion had ever been entertained. It seems proper,\r\ntherefore, to remind those who are in the habit of referring to these\r\nworks for guidance, that there may possibly be some sources of danger\r\nthey have slighted or omitted, quite as important as a trifling\r\nirregularity of diet, or a confined state of the bowels, and that\r\nwhatever confidence a physician may have in his own mode of treatment,\r\nhis services are of questionable value whenever he carries the bane as\r\nwell as the antidote about his person.\r\n\r\nThe practical point to be illustrated is the following:\r\n\r\nThe disease known as Puerperal Fever is so far contagious as to be\r\nfrequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses.\r\n\r\nLet me begin by throwing out certain incidental questions, which,\r\nwithout being absolutely essential, would render the subject more\r\ncomplicated, and by making such concessions and assumptions as may be\r\nfairly supposed to be without the pale of discussion.\r\n\r\n1. It is granted that all the forms of what is called puerperal fever\r\nmay not be, and probably are not, equally contagious or infectious. I\r\ndo not enter into the distinctions which have been drawn by authors,\r\nbecause the facts do not appear to me sufficient to establish any\r\nabsolute line of demarcation between such forms as may be propagated by\r\ncontagion and those which are never so propagated. This general result I\r\nshall only support by the authority of Dr. Ramsbotham, who gives, as the\r\nresult of his experience, that the same symptoms belong to what he calls\r\nthe infectious and the sporadic forms of the disease, and the opinion\r\nof Armstrong in his original Essay. If others can show any such\r\ndistinction, I leave it to them to do it. But there are cases enough\r\nthat show the prevalence of the disease among the patients of a single\r\npractitioner when it was in no degree epidemic, in the proper sense\r\nof the term. I may refer to those of Mr. Roberton and of Dr. Peirson,\r\nhereafter to be cited, as examples.\r\n\r\n2. I shall not enter into any dispute about the particular mode of\r\ninfection, whether it be by the atmosphere the physician carries about\r\nhim into the sick-chamber, or by the direct application of the virus to\r\nthe absorbing surfaces with which his hand comes in contact. Many facts\r\nand opinions are in favor of each of these modes of transmission. But it\r\nis obvious that in the majority of cases it must be impossible to decide\r\nby which of these channels the disease is conveyed, from the nature of\r\nthe intercourse between the physician and the patient.\r\n\r\n3. It is not pretended that the contagion of puerperal fever must always\r\nbe followed by the disease. It is true of all contagious diseases, that\r\nthey frequently spare those who appear to be fully submitted to their\r\ninfluence. Even the vaccine virus, fresh from the subject, fails every\r\nday to produce its legitimate effect, though every precaution is taken\r\nto insure its action. This is still more remarkably the case with\r\nscarlet fever and some other diseases.\r\n\r\n4. It is granted that the disease may be produced and variously modified\r\nby many causes besides contagion, and more especially by epidemic and\r\nendemic influences. But this is not peculiar to the disease in question.\r\nThere is no doubt that small-pox is propagated to a great extent by\r\ncontagion, yet it goes through the same periods of periodical increase\r\nand diminution which have been remarked in puerperal fever. If the\r\nquestion is asked how we are to reconcile the great variations in the\r\nmortality of puerperal fever in different seasons and places with the\r\nsupposition of contagion, I will answer it by another question from\r\nMr. Farr's letter to the Registrar-General. He makes the statement that\r\n“five die weekly of small-pox in the metropolis when the disease is not\r\nepidemic,”--and adds, “The problem for solution is,--Why do the five\r\ndeaths become 10, 15, 20, 31, 58, 88, weekly, and then progressively\r\nfall through the same measured steps?”\r\n\r\n5. I take it for granted, that if it can be shown that great numbers\r\nof lives have been and are sacrificed to ignorance or blindness on this\r\npoint, no other error of which physicians or nurses may be occasionally\r\nsuspected will be alleged in palliation of this; but that whenever and\r\nwherever they can be shown to carry disease and death instead of health\r\nand safety, the common instincts of humanity will silence every attempt\r\nto explain away their responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe treatise of Dr. Gordon of Aberdeen was published in the year 1795,\r\nbeing among the earlier special works upon the disease. Apart of\r\nhis testimony has been occasionally copied into other works, but his\r\nexpressions are so clear, his experience is given with such manly\r\ndistinctness and disinterested honesty, that it may be quoted as a model\r\nwhich might have been often followed with advantage.\r\n\r\n“This disease seized such women only as were visited, or delivered by a\r\npractitioner, or taken care of by a nurse, who had previously attended\r\npatients affected with the disease.”\r\n\r\n“I had evident proofs of its infectious nature, and that the infection\r\nwas as readily communicated as that of the small-pox or measles,\r\nand operated more speedily than any other infection with which I am\r\nacquainted.”\r\n\r\n“I had evident proofs that every person who had been with a patient\r\nin the puerperal fever became charged with an atmosphere of infection,\r\nwhich was communicated to every pregnant woman who happened to come\r\nwithin its sphere. This is not an assertion, but a fact, admitting\r\nof demonstration, as may be seen by a perusal of the foregoing\r\ntable,”--referring to a table of seventy-seven cases, in many of which\r\nthe channel of propagation was evident.\r\n\r\nHe adds, “It is a disagreeable declaration for me to mention, that I\r\nmyself was the means of carrying the infection to a great number of\r\nwomen.” He then enumerates a number of instances in which the disease\r\nwas conveyed by midwives and others to the neighboring villages, and\r\ndeclares that “these facts fully prove that the cause of the puerperal\r\nfever, of which I treat, was a specific contagion, or infection,\r\naltogether unconnected with a noxious constitution of the atmosphere.”\r\n\r\nBut his most terrible evidence is given in these words: “I ARRIVED AT\r\nTHAT CERTAINTY IN THE MATTER, THAT I COULD VENTURE TO FORETELL WHAT\r\nWOMEN WOULD BE AFFECTED WITH THE DISEASE, UPON HEARING BY WHAT MIDWIFE\r\nTHEY WERE TO BE DELIVERED, OR BY WHAT NURSE THEY WERE TO BE ATTENDED,\r\nDURING THEIR LYING-IN: AND ALMOST IN EVERY INSTANCE, MY PREDICTION WAS\r\nVERIFIED.”\r\n\r\nEven previously to Gordon, Mr. White of Manchester had said, “I am\r\nacquainted with two gentlemen in another town, where the whole business\r\nof midwifery is divided betwixt them, and it is very remarkable that one\r\nof them loses several patients every year of the puerperal fever, and\r\nthe other never so much as meets with the disorder,”--a difference\r\nwhich he seems to attribute to their various modes of treatment. [On the\r\nManagement of Lying-in Women, p. 120.]\r\n\r\nDr. Armstrong has given a number of instances in his Essay on Puerperal\r\nFever, of the prevalence of the disease among the patients of a single\r\npractitioner. At Sunderland, “in all, forty-three cases occurred from\r\nthe 1st of January to the 1st of October, when the disease ceased; and\r\nof this number forty were witnessed by Mr. Gregson and his assistant,\r\nMr. Gregory, the remainder having been separately seen by three\r\naccoucheurs.” There is appended to the London edition of this Essay, a\r\nletter from Mr. Gregson, in which that gentleman says, in reference to\r\nthe great number of cases occurring in his practice, “The cause of this\r\nI cannot pretend fully to explain, but I should be wanting in common\r\nliberality if I were to make any hesitation in asserting, that the\r\ndisease which appeared in my practice was highly contagious, and\r\ncommunicable from one puerperal woman to another.” “It is customary\r\namong the lower and middle ranks of people to make frequent personal\r\nvisits to puerperal women resident in the same neighborhood, and I have\r\nample evidence for affirming that the infection of the disease was often\r\ncarried about in that manner; and, however painful to my feelings,\r\nI must in candor declare, that it is very probable the contagion was\r\nconveyed, in some instances, by myself, though I took every possible\r\ncare to prevent such a thing from happening, the moment that I\r\nascertained that the distemper was infectious.” Dr. Armstrong goes on to\r\nmention six other instances within his knowledge, in which the disease\r\nhad at different times and places been limited, in the same singular\r\nmanner, to the practice of individuals, while it existed scarcely if\r\nat all among the patients of others around them. Two of the gentlemen\r\nbecame so convinced of their conveying the contagion, that they withdrew\r\nfor a time from practice.\r\n\r\nI find a brief notice, in an American Journal, of another series of\r\ncases, first mentioned by Mr. Davies, in the “Medical Repository.” This\r\ngentleman stated his conviction that the disease is contagious.\r\n\r\n“In the autumn of 1822 he met with twelve cases, while his medical\r\nfriends in the neighborhood did not meet with any, 'or at least very\r\nfew.' He could attribute this circumstance to no other cause than his\r\nhaving been present at the examination, after death, of two cases, some\r\ntime previous, and of his having imparted the disease to his patients,\r\nnotwithstanding every precaution.”\r\n\r\nDr. Gooch says, “It is not uncommon for the greater number of cases to\r\noccur in the practice of one man, whilst the other practitioners of the\r\nneighborhood, who are not more skilful or more busy, meet with few\r\nor none. A practitioner opened the body of a woman who had died of\r\npuerperal fever, and continued to wear the same clothes. A lady whom he\r\ndelivered a few days afterwards was attacked with and died of a similar\r\ndisease; two more of his lying-in patients, in rapid succession, met\r\nwith the same fate; struck by the thought, that he might have carried\r\ncontagion in his clothes, he instantly changed them, and 'met with no\r\nmore cases of the kind.' A woman in the country, who was employed as\r\nwasherwoman and nurse, washed the linen of one who had died of puerperal\r\nfever; the next lying-in patient she nursed died of the same disease;\r\na third nursed by her met with the same fate, till the neighborhood,\r\ngetting afraid of her, ceased to employ her.”\r\n\r\nIn the winter of the year 1824, “Several instances occurred of its\r\nprevalence among the patients of particular practitioners, whilst others\r\nwho were equally busy met with few or none. One instance of this\r\nkind was very remarkable. A general practitioner, in large midwifery\r\npractice, lost so many patients from puerperal fever, that he determined\r\nto deliver no more for some time, but that his partner should attend in\r\nhis place. This plan was pursued for one month, during which not a case\r\nof the disease occurred in their practice. The elder practitioner, being\r\nthen sufficiently recovered, returned to his practice, but the first\r\npatient he attended was attacked by the disease and died. A physician,\r\nwho met him in consultation soon afterwards, about a case of a different\r\nkind, and who knew nothing of his misfortune, asked him whether\r\npuerperal fever was at all prevalent in his neighborhood, on which he\r\nburst into tears, and related the above circumstances.\r\n\r\n“Among the cases which I saw this season in consultation, four occurred\r\nin one month in the practice of one medical man, and all of them\r\nterminated fatally.” [Lond. Med. Gaz. May 2, 1835.]\r\n\r\nDr. Ramsbotham asserted, in a Lecture at the London Hospital, that\r\nhe had known the disease spread through a particular district, or be\r\nconfined to the practice of a particular person, almost every patient\r\nbeing attacked with it, while others had not a single case. It seemed\r\ncapable, he thought, of conveyance, not only by common modes; but\r\nthrough the dress of the attendants upon the patient.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to be found in the “London Medical Gazette” for January,\r\n1840, Mr. Roberton of Manchester makes the statement which I here give\r\nin a somewhat condensed form.\r\n\r\nA midwife delivered a woman on the 4th of December, 1830, who died soon\r\nafter with the symptoms of puerperal fever. In one month from this date\r\nthe same midwife delivered thirty women, residing in different parts of\r\nan extensive suburb, of which number sixteen caught the disease and all\r\ndied. These were the only cases which had occurred for a considerable\r\ntime in Manchester. The other midwives connected with the same\r\ncharitable institution as the woman already mentioned are twenty-five in\r\nnumber, and deliver, on an average, ninety women a week, or about three\r\nhundred and eighty a month. None of these women had a case of puerperal\r\nfever. “Yet all this time this woman was crossing the other midwives in\r\nevery direction, scores of the patients of the charity being delivered\r\nby them in the very same quarters where her cases of fever were\r\nhappening.”\r\n\r\nMr. Roberton remarks, that little more than half the women she delivered\r\nduring this month took the fever; that on some days all escaped, on\r\nothers only one or more out of three or four; a circumstance similar to\r\nwhat is seen in other infectious maladies.\r\n\r\nDr. Blundell says, “Those who have never made the experiment can have\r\nbut a faint conception how difficult it is to obtain the exact truth\r\nrespecting any occurrence in which feelings and interests are concerned.\r\nOmitting particulars, then, I content myself with remarking, generally,\r\nthat from more than one district I have received accounts of the\r\nprevalence of puerperal fever in the practice of some individuals, while\r\nits occurrence in that of others, in the same neighborhood, was not\r\nobserved. Some, as I have been told, have lost ten, twelve, or a greater\r\nnumber of patients, in scarcely broken succession; like their evil\r\ngenius, the puerperal fever has seemed to stalk behind them wherever\r\nthey went. Some have deemed it prudent to retire for a time from\r\npractice. In fine, that this fever may occur spontaneously, I admit;\r\nthat its infectious nature may be plausibly disputed, I do not deny; but\r\nI add, considerately, that in my own family I had rather that those\r\nI esteemed the most should be delivered, unaided, in a stable, by the\r\nmanger-side, than that they should receive the best help, in the fairest\r\napartment, but exposed to the vapors of this pitiless disease. Gossiping\r\nfriends, wet-nurses, monthly nurses, the practitioner himself, these\r\nare the channels by which, as I suspect, the infection is principally\r\nconveyed.”\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, Dr. King\r\nmentioned that some years since a practitioner at Woolwich lost sixteen\r\npatients from puerperal fever in the same year. He was compelled to give\r\nup practice for one or two years, his business being divided among\r\nthe neighboring practitioners. No case of puerperal fever occurred\r\nafterwards, neither had any of the neighboring surgeons any cases of\r\nthis disease.\r\n\r\nAt the same meeting Mr. Hutchinson mentioned the occurrence of three\r\nconsecutive cases of puerperal fever, followed subsequently by two\r\nothers, all in the practice of one accoucheur.[Lancet, May 2, 1840.]\r\n\r\nDr. Lee makes the following statement: “In the last two weeks of\r\nSeptember, 1827, five fatal cases of uterine inflammation came under our\r\nobservation. All the individuals so attacked had been attended in labor\r\nby the same midwife, and no example of a febrile or inflammatory disease\r\nof a serious nature occurred during that period among the other patients\r\nof the Westminster General Dispensary, who had been attended by the\r\nother midwives belonging to that institution.”\r\n\r\nThe recurrence of long series of cases like those I have cited, reported\r\nby those most interested to disbelieve in contagion, scattered\r\nalong through an interval of half a century, might have been thought\r\nsufficient to satisfy the minds of all inquirers that here was\r\nsomething more than a singular coincidence. But if, on a more extended\r\nobservation, it should be found that the same ominous groups of cases\r\nclustering about individual practitioners were observed in a remote\r\ncountry, at different times, and in widely separated regions, it would\r\nseem incredible that any should be found too prejudiced or indolent to\r\naccept the solemn truth knelled into their ears by the funeral bells\r\nfrom both sides of the ocean,--the plain conclusion that the physician\r\nand the disease entered, hand in hand, into the chamber of the\r\nunsuspecting patient.\r\n\r\nThat such series of cases have been observed in this country, and in\r\nthis neighborhood, I proceed to show.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Francis's “Notes to Denman's Midwifery,” a passage is cited from\r\nDr. Hosack, in which he refers to certain puerperal cases which proved\r\nfatal to several lying-in women, and in some of which the disease was\r\nsupposed to be conveyed by the accoucheurs themselves.\r\n\r\nA writer in the “New York Medical and Physical Journal” for October,\r\n1829, in speaking of the occurrence of puerperal fever, confined to one\r\nman's practice, remarks, “We have known cases of this kind occur, though\r\nrarely, in New York.”\r\n\r\nI mention these little hints about the occurrence of such cases,\r\npartly because they are the first I have met with in American medical\r\nliterature, but more especially because they serve to remind us that\r\nbehind the fearful array of published facts there lies a dark list of\r\nsimilar events, unwritten in the records of science, but long remembered\r\nby many a desolated fireside.\r\n\r\nCertainly nothing can be more open and explicit than the account given\r\nby Dr. Peirson of Salem, of the cases seen by him. In the first nineteen\r\ndays of January, 1829, he had five consecutive cases of puerperal fever,\r\nevery patient he attended being attacked, and the three first cases\r\nproving fatal. In March of the same year he had two moderate cases, in\r\nJune, another case, and in July, another, which proved fatal. “Up to\r\nthis period,” he remarks, “I am not informed that a single case had\r\noccurred in the practice of any other physician. Since that period\r\nI have had no fatal case in my practice, although I have had several\r\ndangerous cases. I have attended in all twenty cases of this disease, of\r\nwhich four have been fatal. I am not aware that there has been any\r\nother case in the town of distinct puerperal peritonitis, although I am\r\nwilling to admit my information may be very defective on this point.\r\nI have been told of some 'mixed cases,' and 'morbid affections after\r\ndelivery.'”\r\n\r\nIn the “Quarterly Summary of the Transactions of the College of\r\nPhysicians of Philadelphia” may be found some most extraordinary\r\ndevelopments respecting a series of cases occurring in the practice of a\r\nmember of that body.\r\n\r\nDr. Condie called the attention of the Society to the prevalence, at the\r\npresent time, of puerperal fever of a peculiarly insidious and malignant\r\ncharacter. “In the practice of one gentleman extensively engaged as an\r\nobstetrician, nearly every female he has attended in confinement, during\r\nseveral weeks past, within the above limits” (the southern sections and\r\nneighboring districts), “had been attacked by the fever.”\r\n\r\n“An important query presents itself, the Doctor observed, in reference\r\nto the particular form of fever now prevalent. Is it, namely, capable\r\nof being propagated by contagion, and is a physician who has been in\r\nattendance upon a case of the disease warranted in continuing, without\r\ninterruption, his practice as an obstetrician? Dr. C., although not\r\na believer in the contagious character of many of those affections\r\ngenerally supposed to be propagated in this manner, has nevertheless\r\nbecome convinced by the facts that have fallen under his notice, that\r\nthe puerperal fever now prevailing is capable of being communicated by\r\ncontagion. How otherwise can be explained the very curious circumstance\r\nof the disease in one district being exclusively confined to the\r\npractice of a single physician, a Fellow of this College, extensively\r\nengaged in obstetrical practice,--while no instance of the disease\r\nhas occurred in the patients under the care of any other accoucheur\r\npractising within the same district; scarcely a female that has been\r\ndelivered for weeks past has escaped an attack?”\r\n\r\nDr. Rutter, the practitioner referred to, “observed that, after the\r\noccurrence of a number of cases of the disease in his practice, he\r\nhad left the city and remained absent for a week, but on returning, no\r\narticle of clothing he then wore having been used by him before, one\r\nof the very first cases of parturition he attended was followed by\r\nan attack of the fever, and terminated fatally; he cannot, readily,\r\ntherefore, believe in the transmission of the disease from female to\r\nfemale, in the person or clothes of the physician.”\r\n\r\nThe meeting at which these remarks were made was held on the 3d of May,\r\n1842. In a letter dated December 20, 1842, addressed to Dr. Meigs, and\r\nto be found in the “Medical Examiner,” he speaks of “those horrible\r\ncases of puerperal fever, some of which you did me the favor to see with\r\nme during the past summer,” and talks of his experience in the disease,\r\n“now numbering nearly seventy cases, all of which have occurred within\r\nless than a twelvemonth past.”\r\n\r\nAnd Dr. Meigs asserts, on the same page, “Indeed, I believe that his\r\npractice in that department of the profession was greater than that\r\nof any other gentleman, which was probably the cause of his seeing a\r\ngreater number of the cases.” This from a professor of midwifery, who\r\nsome time ago assured a gentleman whom he met in consultation, that the\r\nnight on which they met was the eighteenth in succession that he himself\r\nhad been summoned from his repose, seems hardly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI must call the attention of the inquirer most particularly to the\r\nQuarterly Report above referred to, and the letters of Dr. Meigs and Dr.\r\nRutter, to be found in the “Medical Examiner.” Whatever impression they\r\nmay produce upon his mind, I trust they will at least convince him\r\nthat there is some reason for looking into this apparently uninviting\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the College of Physicians just mentioned, Dr. Warrington\r\nstated, that a few days after assisting at an autopsy of puerperal\r\nperitonitis, in which he laded out the contents of the abdominal cavity\r\nwith his hands, he was called upon to deliver three women in rapid\r\nsuccession. All of these women were attacked with different forms of\r\nwhat is commonly called puerperal fever. Soon after these he saw two\r\nother patients, both on the same day, with the same disease. Of these\r\nfive patients two died.\r\n\r\nAt the same meeting, Dr. West mentioned a fact related to him by Dr.\r\nSamuel Jackson of Northumberland. Seven females, delivered by Dr.\r\nJackson in rapid succession, while practising in Northumberland County,\r\nwere all attacked with puerperal fever, and five of them died. “Women,”\r\n he said, “who had expected me to attend upon them, now becoming alarmed,\r\nremoved out of my reach, and others sent for a physician residing\r\nseveral miles distant. These women, as well as those attended by\r\nmidwives; all did well; nor did we hear of any deaths in child-bed\r\nwithin a radius of fifty miles, excepting two, and these I afterwards\r\nascertained to have been caused by other diseases.” He underwent, as\r\nhe thought, a thorough purification, and still his next patient was\r\nattacked with the disease and died. He was led to suspect that the\r\ncontagion might have been carried in the gloves which he had worn in\r\nattendance upon the previous cases. Two months or more after this he had\r\ntwo other cases. He could find nothing to account for these, unless it\r\nwere the instruments for giving enemata, which had been used in two of\r\nthe former cases, and were employed by these patients. When the\r\nfirst case occurred, he was attending and dressing a limb extensively\r\nmortified from erysipelas, and went immediately to the accouchement with\r\nhis clothes and gloves most thoroughly imbued with its efluvia. And here\r\nI may mention, that this very Dr. Samuel Jackson of Northumberland is\r\none of Dr. Dewees's authorities against contagion.\r\n\r\nThe three following statements are now for the first time given to the\r\npublic. All of the cases referred to occurred within this State, and two\r\nof the three series in Boston and its immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nI. The first is a series of cases which took place during the last\r\nspring in a town at some distance from this neighborhood. A physician of\r\nthat town, Dr. C., had the following consecutive cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n   No. 1, delivered March 20, died March 24.\r\n    “ 2,  “    April 9,  “ April 14.\r\n    “ 3,  “     “  10,  “  “  14.\r\n    “ 4,  “     “  11,  “  “  18.\r\n    “ 5,  “     “  27,  “  May  3.\r\n    “ 6,  “     “  28, had some symptoms, (recovered.)\r\n    “ 7,  “    May  8, had some symptoms, (also recovered.)\r\n\r\nThese were the only cases attended by this physician during the period\r\nreferred to. “They were all attended by him until their termination,\r\nwith the exception of the patient No. 6, who fell into the hands of\r\nanother physician on the 2d of May. (Dr. C. left town for a few days\r\nat this time.) Dr. C. attended cases immediately before and after the\r\nabove-named periods, none of which, however, presented any peculiar\r\nsymptoms of the disease.”\r\n\r\nAbout the 1st of July he attended another patient in a neighboring\r\nvillage, who died two or three days after delivery.\r\n\r\nThe first patient, it is stated, was delivered on the 20th of March. “On\r\nthe 19th, Dr. C. made the autopsy of a man who died suddenly, sick only\r\nforty-eight hours; had oedema of the thigh, and gangrene extending from\r\na little above the ankle into the cavity of the abdomen.” Dr. C. wounded\r\nhimself, very slightly, in the right hand during the autopsy. The hand\r\nwas quite painful the night following, during his attendance on the\r\npatient No. 1. He did not see this patient after the 20th, being\r\nconfined to the house, and very sick from the wound just mentioned, from\r\nthis time until the 3d of April.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases of erysipelas occurred in the house where the autopsy\r\nmentioned above took place, soon after the examination. There were also\r\nmany cases of erysipelas in town at the time of the fatal puerperal\r\ncases which have been mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe nurse who laid out the body of the patient No. 3 was taken on the\r\nevening of the same day with sore throat and erysipelas, and died in ten\r\ndays from the first attack.\r\n\r\nThe nurse who laid out the body of the patient No. 4 was taken on the\r\nday following with symptoms like those of this patient, and died in a\r\nweek, without any external marks of erysipelas.\r\n\r\n“No other cases of similar character with those of Dr. C. occurred in\r\nthe practice of any of the physicians in the town or vicinity at the\r\ntime. Deaths following confinement have occurred in the practice of\r\nother physicians during the past year, but they were not cases of\r\npuerperal fever. No post-mortem examinations were held in any of these\r\npuerperal cases.”\r\n\r\nSome additional statements in this letter are deserving of insertion.\r\n\r\n“A physician attended a woman in the immediate neighborhood of the cases\r\nnumbered 2, 3, and 4. This patient was confined the morning of March\r\n1st, and died on the night of March 7th. It is doubtful whether this\r\nshould be considered a case of puerperal fever. She had suffered from\r\ncanker, indigestion, and diarrhoea for a year previous to her delivery.\r\nHer complaints were much aggravated for two or three months previous\r\nto delivery; she had become greatly emaciated, and weakened to such an\r\nextent that it had not been expected that she would long survive her\r\nconfinement, if indeed she reached that period. Her labor was easy\r\nenough; she flowed a good deal, seemed exceedingly prostrated, had\r\nringing in the ears, and other symptoms of exhaustion; the pulse was\r\nquick and small. On the second and third day there was some tenderness\r\nand tumefaction of the abdomen, which increased somewhat on the fourth\r\nand fifth. He had cases in midwifery before and after this, which\r\npresented nothing peculiar.”\r\n\r\nIt is also mentioned in the same letter, that another physician had\r\na case during the last summer and another last fall, both of which\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nAnother gentleman reports a case last December, a second case five\r\nweeks, and another three weeks since. All these recovered. A case also\r\noccurred very recently in the practice of a physician in the village\r\nwhere the eighth patient of Dr. C. resides, which proved fatal. “This\r\npatient had some patches of erysipelas on the legs and arms. The same\r\nphysician has delivered three cases since, which have all done well.\r\nThere have been no other cases in this town or its vicinity recently.\r\nThere have been some few cases of erysipelas.” It deserves notice\r\nthat the partner of Dr. C., who attended the autopsy of the man above\r\nmentioned and took an active part in it; who also suffered very slightly\r\nfrom a prick under the thumb-nail received during the examination, had\r\ntwelve cases of midwifery between March 26th and April 12th, all of\r\nwhich did well, and presented no peculiar symptoms. It should also be\r\nstated, that during these seventeen days he was in attendance on all the\r\ncases of erysipelas in the house where the autopsy had been performed.\r\n\r\nI owe these facts to the prompt kindness of a gentleman whose\r\nintelligence and character are sufficient guaranty for their accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe two following letters were addressed to my friend Dr. Scorer, by the\r\ngentleman in whose practice the cases of puerperal fever occurred.\r\nHis name renders it unnecessary to refer more particularly to these\r\ngentlemen, who on their part have manifested the most perfect freedom\r\nand courtesy in affording these accounts of their painful experience.\r\n\r\n“January 28, 1843.\r\n\r\nII.... “The time to which you allude was in 1830. The first case was in\r\nFebruary, during a very cold time. She was confined the 4th, and died\r\nthe 12th. Between the 10th and 28th of this month, I attended six women\r\nin labor, all of whom did well except the last, as also two who were\r\nconfined March 1st and 5th. Mrs. E., confined February 28th, sickened,\r\nand died March 8th. The next day, 9th, I inspected the body, and the\r\nnight after attended a lady, Mrs. B., who sickened, and died 16th. The\r\n10th, I attended another, Mrs. G., who sickened, but recovered. March\r\n16th, I went from Mrs. G.'s room to attend a Mrs. H., who sickened, and\r\ndied 21st. The 17th, I inspected Mrs. B. On the 19th, I went directly\r\nfrom Mrs. H.'s room to attend another lady, Mrs. G., who also sickened,\r\nand died 22d. While Mrs. B. was sick, on 15th, I went directly from her\r\nroom a few rods, and attended another woman, who was not sick. Up to\r\n20th of this month I wore the same clothes. I now refused to attend any\r\nlabor, and did not till April 21st, when, having thoroughly cleansed\r\nmyself, I resumed my practice, and had no more puerperal fever.\r\n\r\n“The cases were not confined to a narrow space. The two nearest were\r\nhalf a mile from each other, and half that distance from my residence.\r\nThe others were from two to three miles apart, and nearly that distance\r\nfrom my residence. There were no other cases in their immediate vicinity\r\nwhich came to my knowledge. The general health of all the women was\r\npretty good, and all the labors as good as common, except the first.\r\nThis woman, in consequence of my not arriving in season, and the child\r\nbeing half-born at some time before I arrived, was very much exposed to\r\nthe cold at the time of confinement, and afterwards, being confined in a\r\nvery open, cold room. Of the six cases you perceive only one recovered.\r\n\r\n“In the winter of 1817 two of my patients had puerperal fever, one very\r\nbadly, the other not so badly. Both recovered. One other had swelled\r\nleg, or phlegmasia dolens, and one or two others did not recover as well\r\nas usual.\r\n\r\n“In the summer of 1835 another disastrous period occurred in my\r\npractice. July 1st, I attended a lady in labor, who was afterwards quite\r\nill and feverish; but at the time I did not consider her case a decided\r\npuerperal fever. On the 8th, I attended one who did well. On the 12th,\r\none who was seriously sick. This was also an equivocal case, apparently\r\narising from constipation and irritation of the rectum. These women were\r\nten miles apart and five from my residence. On 15th and 20th, two who\r\ndid well. On 25th, I attended another. This was a severe labor, and\r\nfollowed by unequivocal puerperal fever, or peritonitis. She recovered.\r\nAugust 2d and 3d, in about twenty-four hours I attended four persons.\r\nTwo of them did very well; one was attacked with some of the common\r\nsymptoms, which however subsided in a day or two, and the other had\r\ndecided puerperal fever, but recovered. This woman resided five miles\r\nfrom me. Up to this time I wore the same coat. All my other clothes had\r\nfrequently been changed. On 6th, I attended two women, one of whom was\r\nnot sick at all; but the other, Mrs. L., was afterwards taken ill. On\r\n10th, I attended a lady, who did very well. I had previously changed all\r\nmy clothes, and had no garment on which had been in a puerperal room. On\r\n12th, I was called to Mrs. S., in labor. While she was ill, I left her\r\nto visit Mrs. L., one of the ladies who was confined on 6th. Mrs. L. had\r\nbeen more unwell than usual, but I had not considered her case anything\r\nmore than common till this visit. I had on a surtout at this visit,\r\nwhich, on my return to Mrs. S., I left in another room. Mrs. S. was\r\ndelivered on 13th with forceps. These women both died of decided\r\npuerperal fever.\r\n\r\n“While I attended these women in their fevers, I changed my clothes, and\r\nwashed my hands in a solution of chloride of lime after each visit. I\r\nattended seven women in labor during this period, all of whom recovered\r\nwithout sickness.\r\n\r\n“In my practice I have had several single cases of puerperal fever, some\r\nof whom have died and some have recovered. Until the year 1830 I had\r\nno suspicion that the disease could be communicated from one patient\r\nto another by a nurse or midwife; but I now think the foregoing facts\r\nstrongly favor that idea. I was so much convinced of this fact, that I\r\nadopted the plan before related.\r\n\r\n“I believe my own health was as good as usual at each of the above\r\nperiods. I have no recollections to the contrary.\r\n\r\n“I believe I have answered all your questions. I have been more\r\nparticular on some points perhaps than necessary; but I thought you\r\ncould form your own opinion better than to take mine. In 1830 I wrote\r\nto Dr. Charming a more particular statement of my cases. If I have not\r\nanswered your questions sufficiently, perhaps Dr. C. may have my letter\r\nto him, and you can find your answer there.” [In a letter to myself,\r\nthis gentleman also stated, “I do not recollect that there was any\r\nerysipelas or any other disease particularly prevalent at the time.”]\r\n\r\n“BOSTON, February 3, 1843.\r\n\r\nIII. “MY DEAR SIR,--I received a note from you last evening, requesting\r\nme to answer certain questions therein proposed, touching the cases\r\nof puerperal fever which came under my observation the past summer. It\r\ngives me pleasure to comply with your request, so far as it is in my\r\npower so to do, but, owing to the hurry in preparing for a journey, the\r\nnotes of the cases I had then taken were lost or mislaid. The principal\r\nfacts, however, are too vivid upon my recollection to be soon forgotten.\r\nI think, therefore, that I shall be able to give you all the information\r\nyou may require.\r\n\r\n“All the cases that occurred in my practice took place between the 7th\r\nof May and the 17th of June 1842.\r\n\r\n“They were not confined to any particular part of the city. The first\r\ntwo cases were patients residing at the South End, the next was at the\r\nextreme North End, one living in Sea Street and the other in Roxbury.\r\nThe following is the order in which they occurred:\r\n\r\n“Case 1. Mrs.______ was confined on the 7th of May, at 5 o'clock, P. M.,\r\nafter a natural labor of six hours. At 12 o'clock at night, on the 9th\r\n(thirty-one hours after confinement), she was taken with severe chill,\r\nprevious to which she was as comfortable as women usually are under the\r\ncircumstances. She died on the 10th.\r\n\r\n“Case 2. Mrs.______ was confined on the 10th of June (four weeks after\r\nMrs. C.), at 11 A. M., after a natural, but somewhat severe labor of\r\nfive hours. At 7 o'clock, on the morning of the 11th, she had a chill.\r\nDied on the 12th.\r\n\r\n“Case 3. Mrs.______, confined on the 14th of June, was comfortable until\r\nthe 18th, when symptoms of puerperal fever were manifest. She died on\r\nthe 20th.\r\n\r\n“Case 4. Mrs.______, confined June 17th, at 5 o'clock, A. M., was doing\r\nwell until the morning of the 19th. She died on the evening of the 21st.\r\n\r\n“Case 5. Mrs.______ was confined with her fifth child on the 17th of\r\nJune, at 6 o'clock in the evening. This patient had been attacked with\r\npuerperal fever, at three of her previous confinements, but the disease\r\nyielded to depletion and other remedies without difficulty. This time, I\r\nregret to say, I was not so fortunate. She was not attacked, as were the\r\nother patients, with a chill, but complained of extreme pain in abdomen,\r\nand tenderness on pressure, almost from the moment of her confinement.\r\nIn this as in the other cases, the disease resisted all remedies, and\r\nshe died in great distress on the 22d of the same month. Owing to\r\nthe extreme heat of the season, and my own indisposition, none of the\r\nsubjects were examined after death. Dr. Channing, who was in attendance\r\nwith me on the three last cases, proposed to have a post-mortem\r\nexamination of the subject of case No. 5, but from some cause which I do\r\nnot now recollect it was not obtained.\r\n\r\n“You wish to know whether I wore the same clothes when attending the\r\ndifferent cases. I cannot positively say, but I should think I did not,\r\nas the weather became warmer after the first two cases; I therefore\r\nthink it probable that I made a change of at least a part of my dress.\r\nI have had no other case of puerperal fever in my own practice for three\r\nyears, save those above related, and I do not remember to have lost a\r\npatient before with this disease. While absent, last July, I visited\r\ntwo patients sick with puerperal fever, with a friend of mine in the\r\ncountry. Both of them recovered.\r\n\r\n“The cases that I have recorded were not confined to any particular\r\nconstitution or temperament, but it seized upon the strong and the weak,\r\nthe old and the young,--one being over forty years, and the youngest\r\nunder eighteen years of age.... If the disease is of an erysipelatous\r\nnature, as many suppose, contagionists may perhaps find some ground for\r\ntheir belief in the fact, that, for two weeks previous to my first case\r\nof puerperal fever, I had been attending a severe case of erysipelas,\r\nand the infection may have been conveyed through me to the patient; but,\r\non the other hand, why is not this the case with other physicians,\r\nor with the same physician at all times, for since my return from\r\nthe country I have had a more inveterate case of erysipelas than ever\r\nbefore, and no difficulty whatever has attended any of my midwifery\r\ncases?”\r\n\r\nI am assured, on unquestionable authority, that “About three years\r\nsince, a gentleman in extensive midwifery business, in a neighboring\r\nState, lost in the course of a few weeks eight patients in child-bed,\r\nseven of them being undoubted cases of puerperal fever. No other\r\nphysician of the town lost a single patient of this disease during the\r\nsame period.” And from what I have heard in conversation with some of\r\nour most experienced practitioners, I am inclined to think many cases of\r\nthe kind might be brought to light by extensive inquiry.\r\n\r\nThis long catalogue of melancholy histories assumes a still darker\r\naspect when we remember how kindly nature deals with the parturient\r\nfemale, when she is not immersed in the virulent atmosphere of an impure\r\nlying-in hospital, or poisoned in her chamber by the unsuspected breath\r\nof contagion. From all causes together, not more than four deaths in a\r\nthousand births and miscarriages happened in England and Wales during\r\nthe period embraced by the first “Report of the Registrar-General.”\r\n In the second Report the mortality was shown to be about five in one\r\nthousand. In the Dublin Lying-in Hospital, during the seven years of\r\nDr. Collins's mastership, there was one case of puerperal fever to 178\r\ndeliveries, or less than six to the thousand, and one death from this\r\ndisease in 278 cases, or between three and four to the thousand a yet\r\nduring this period the disease was endemic in the hospital, and might\r\nhave gone on to rival the horrors of the pestilence of the Maternite,\r\nhad not the poison been destroyed by a thorough purification.\r\n\r\nIn private practice, leaving out of view the cases that are to be\r\nascribed to the self-acting system of propagation, it would seem that\r\nthe disease must be far from common. Mr. White of Manchester says, “Out\r\nof the whole number of lying-in patients whom I have delivered (and I\r\nmay safely call it a great one), I have never lost one, nor to the best\r\nof my recollection has one been greatly endangered, by the puerperal,\r\nmiliary, low nervous, putrid malignant, or milk fever.” Dr. Joseph\r\nClarke informed Dr. Collins, that in the course of forty-five years'\r\nmost extensive practice he lost but four patients from this disease. One\r\nof the most eminent practitioners of Glasgow, who has been engaged in\r\nvery extensive practice for upwards of a quarter of a century, testifies\r\nthat he never saw more than twelve cases of real puerperal fever.\r\n[Lancet, May 4, 1833]\r\n\r\nI have myself been told by two gentlemen practising in this city, and\r\nhaving for many years a large midwifery business, that they had neither\r\nof them lost a patient from this disease, and by one of them that he\r\nhad only seen it in consultation with other physicians. In five hundred\r\ncases of midwifery, of which Dr. Storer has given an abstract in the\r\nfirst number of this Journal, there was only one instance of fatal\r\npuerperal peritonitis.\r\n\r\nIn the view of these facts, it does appear a singular coincidence, that\r\none man or woman should have ten, twenty, thirty, or seventy cases of\r\nthis rare disease following his or her footsteps with the keenness of\r\na beagle, through the streets and lanes of a crowded city, while the\r\nscores that cross the same paths on the same errands know it only\r\nby name. It is a series of similar coincidences which has led us to\r\nconsider the dagger, the musket, and certain innocent-looking white\r\npowders as having some little claim to be regarded as dangerous. It is\r\nthe practical inattention to similar coincidences which has given rise\r\nto the unpleasant but often necessary documents called indictments,\r\nwhich has sharpened a form of the cephalotome sometimes employed in\r\nthe case of adults, and adjusted that modification of the fillet which\r\ndelivers the world of those who happen to be too much in the way while\r\nsuch striking coincidences are taking place.\r\n\r\nI shall now mention a few instances in which the disease appears to have\r\nbeen conveyed by the process of direct inoculation.\r\n\r\nDr. Campbell of Edinburgh states that in October, 1821, he assisted at\r\nthe post-mortem examination of a patient who died with puerperal fever.\r\nHe carried the pelvic viscera in his pocket to the class-room. The same\r\nevening he attended a woman in labor without previously changing his\r\nclothes; this patient died. The next morning he delivered a woman with\r\nthe forceps; she died also, and of many others who were seized with the\r\ndisease within a few weeks, three shared the same fate in succession.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1823, he assisted some of his pupils at the autopsy of a case\r\nof puerperal fever. He was unable to wash his hands with proper care,\r\nfor want of the necessary accommodations. On getting home he found that\r\ntwo patients required his assistance. He went without further ablution,\r\nor changing his clothes; both these patients died with puerperal fever.\r\nThis same Dr. Campbell is one of Dr. Churchill's authorities against\r\ncontagion.\r\n\r\nMr. Roberton says that in one instance within his knowledge a\r\npractitioner passed the catheter for a patient with puerperal fever late\r\nin the evening; the same night he attended a lady who had the symptoms\r\nof the disease on the second day. In another instance a surgeon was\r\ncalled while in the act of inspecting the body of a woman who had died\r\nof this fever, to attend a labor; within forty-eight hours this patient\r\nwas seized with the fever.'\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of March, 1831, a medical practitioner examined the body\r\nof a woman who had died a few days after delivery, from puerperal\r\nperitonitis. On the evening of the 17th he delivered a patient, who was\r\nseized with puerperal fever on the 19th, and died on the 24th. Between\r\nthis period and the 6th of April, the same practitioner attended two\r\nother patients, both of whom were attacked with the same disease and\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1829 a physician was present at the examination of\r\na case of puerperal fever, dissected out the organs, and assisted in\r\nsewing up the body. He had scarcely reached home when he was summoned to\r\nattend a young lady in labor. In sixteen hours she was attacked with the\r\nsymptoms of puerperal fever, and narrowly escaped with her life.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1830, a midwife, who had attended two fatal cases of\r\npuerperal fever at the British Lying-in Hospital, examined a patient\r\nwho had just been admitted, to ascertain if labor had commenced. This\r\npatient remained two days in the expectation that labor would come\r\non, when she returned home and was then suddenly taken in labor and\r\ndelivered before she could set out for the hospital. She went on\r\nfavorably for two days, and was then taken with puerperal fever and died\r\nin thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\n“A young practitioner, contrary to advice, examined the body of a\r\npatient who had died from puerperal fever; there was no epidemic at the\r\ntime; the case appeared to be purely sporadic. He delivered three\r\nother women shortly afterwards; they all died with puerperal fever, the\r\nsymptoms of which broke out very soon after labor. The patients of his\r\ncolleague did well, except one, where he assisted to remove some coagula\r\nfrom the uterus; she was attacked in the same manner as those whom he\r\nhad attended, and died also.” The writer in the “British and Foreign\r\nMedical Review,” from whom I quote this statement,--and who is no\r\nother than Dr. Rigby, adds, “We trust that this fact alone will forever\r\nsilence such doubts, and stamp the well-merited epithet of 'criminal,'\r\nas above quoted, upon such attempts.” [Brit. and For. Medical Review for\r\nJan. 1842, p. 112.]\r\n\r\nFrom the cases given by Mr. Ingleby, I select the following. Two\r\ngentlemen, after having been engaged in conducting the post-mortem\r\nexamination of a case of puerperal fever, went in the same dress, each\r\nrespectively, to a case of midwifery. “The one patient was seized with\r\nthe rigor about thirty hours afterwards. The other patient was seized\r\nwith a rigor the third morning after delivery. One recovered, one died.”\r\n [Edin. Med. and Surg. Journal, April, 1838.] One of these same gentlemen\r\nattended another woman in the same clothes two days after the autopsy\r\nreferred to. “The rigor did not take place until the evening of the\r\nfifth day from the first visit. Result fatal.” These cases belonged to a\r\nseries of seven, the first of which was thought to have originated in\r\na case of erysipelas. “Several cases of a mild character followed the\r\nforegoing seven, and their nature being now most unequivocal, my friend\r\ndeclined visiting all midwifery cases for a time, and there was no\r\nrecurrence of the disease.” These cases occurred in 1833. Five of them\r\nproved fatal. Mr. Ingleby gives another series of seven cases which\r\noccurred to a practitioner in 1836, the first of which was also\r\nattributed to his having opened several erysipelatous abscesses a short\r\ntime previously.\r\n\r\nI need not refer to the case lately read before this Society, in which a\r\nphysician went, soon after performing an autopsy of a case of puerperal\r\nfever, to a woman in labor, who was seized with the same disease and\r\nperished. The forfeit of that error has been already paid.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Medical and Chirurgical Society before referred to,\r\nDr. Merriman related an instance occurring in his own practice, which\r\nexcites a reasonable suspicion that two lives were sacrificed to a\r\nstill less dangerous experiment. He was at the examination of a case\r\nof puerperal fever at two o'clock in the afternoon. He took care not to\r\ntouch the body. At nine o'clock the same evening he attended a woman in\r\nlabor; she was so nearly delivered that he had scarcely anything to do.\r\nThe next morning she had severe rigors, and in forty-eight hours she was\r\na corpse. Her infant had erysipelas and died in two days. [Lancet, May\r\n2, 1840.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the facts which have been stated, it seems proper to\r\nallude to the dangerous and often fatal effects which have followed from\r\nwounds received in the post-mortem examination of patients who have died\r\nof puerperal fever. The fact that such wounds are attended with peculiar\r\nrisk has been long noticed. I find that Chaussier was in the habit of\r\ncautioning his students against the danger to which they were exposed in\r\nthese dissections. [Stein, L'Art d'Accoucher, 1794; Dict. des Sciences\r\nMedicales, art. “Puerperal.”] The head pharmacien of the Hotel Dieu, in\r\nhis analysis of the fluid effused in puerperal peritonitis, says that\r\npractitioners are convinced of its deleterious qualities, and that it is\r\nvery dangerous to apply it to the denuded skin. [Journal de Pharmacie,\r\nJanuary, 1836.] Sir Benjamin Brodie speaks of it as being well known\r\nthat the inoculation of lymph or pus from the peritoneum of a puerperal\r\npatient is often attended with dangerous and even fatal symptoms. Three\r\ncases in confirmation of this statement, two of them fatal, have been\r\nreported to this Society within a few months.\r\n\r\nOf about fifty cases of injuries of this kind, of various degrees of\r\nseverity, which I have collected from different sources, at least twelve\r\nwere instances of infection from puerperal peritonitis. Some of the\r\nothers are so stated as to render it probable that they may have been of\r\nthe same nature. Five other cases were of peritoneal inflammation;\r\nthree in males. Three were what was called enteritis, in one instance\r\ncomplicated with erysipelas; but it is well known that this term has\r\nbeen often used to signify inflammation of the peritoneum covering the\r\nintestines. On the other hand, no case of typhus or typhoid fever is\r\nmentioned as giving rise to dangerous consequences, with the exception\r\nof the single instance of an undertaker mentioned by Mr. Travers, who\r\nseems to have been poisoned by a fluid which exuded from the body.\r\nThe other accidents were produced by dissection, or some other mode of\r\ncontact with bodies of patients who had died of various affections.\r\nThey also differed much in severity, the cases of puerperal origin being\r\namong the most formidable and fatal. Now a moment's reflection will\r\nshow that the number of cases of serious consequences ensuing from the\r\ndissection of the bodies of those who had perished of puerperal fever\r\nis so vastly disproportioned to the relatively small number of autopsies\r\nmade in this complaint as compared with typhus or pneumonia (from which\r\nlast disease not one case of poisoning happened), and still more from\r\nall diseases put together, that the conclusion is irresistible that\r\na most fearful morbid poison is often generated in the course of this\r\ndisease. Whether or not it is sui generis, confined to this disease, or\r\nproduced in some others, as, for instance, erysipelas, I need, not stop\r\nto inquire.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this may be taken the following statement of Dr.\r\nRigby. “That the discharges from a patient under puerperal fever are in\r\nthe highest degree contagious we have abundant evidence in the history\r\nof lying-in hospitals. The puerperal abscesses are also contagious, and\r\nmay be communicated to healthy lying-in women by washing with the same\r\nsponge; this fact has been repeatedly proved in the Vienna Hospital; but\r\nthey are equally communicable to women not pregnant; on more than\r\none occasion the women engaged in washing the soiled bed-linen of the\r\nGeneral Lying-in Hospital have been attacked with abscess in the fingers\r\nor hands, attended with rapidly spreading inflammation of the cellular\r\ntissue.”\r\n\r\nNow add to all this the undisputed fact, that within the walls of\r\nlying-in hospitals there is often generated a miasm, palpable as the\r\nchlorine used to destroy it, tenacious so as in some cases almost to\r\ndefy extirpation, deadly in some institutions as the plague; which has\r\nkilled women in a private hospital of London so fast that they were\r\nburied two in one coffin to conceal its horrors; which enabled Tonnelle\r\nto record two hundred and twenty-two autopsies at the Maternite of\r\nParis; which has led Dr. Lee to express his deliberate conviction that\r\nthe loss of life occasioned by these institutions completely defeats the\r\nobjects of their founders; and out of this train of cumulative evidence,\r\nthe multiplied groups of cases clustering about individuals, the deadly\r\nresults of autopsies, the inoculation by fluids from the living patient,\r\nthe murderous poison of hospitals,--does there not result a conclusion\r\nthat laughs all sophistry to scorn, and renders all argument an insult?\r\n\r\nI have had occasion to mention some instances in which there was an\r\napparent relation between puerperal fever and erysipelas. The length\r\nto which this paper has extended does not allow me to enter into the\r\nconsideration of this most important subject. I will only say, that\r\nthe evidence appears to me altogether satisfactory that some most fatal\r\nseries of puerperal fever have been produced by an infection originating\r\nin the matter or effluvia of erysipelas. In evidence of some connection\r\nbetween the two diseases, I need not go back to the older authors, as\r\nPouteau or Gordon, but will content myself with giving the following\r\nreferences, with their dates; from which it will be seen that the\r\ntestimony has been constantly coming before the profession for the last\r\nfew years.\r\n\r\n“London Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine,” article Puerperal Fever,\r\n1833.\r\n\r\nMr. Ceeley's Account of the Puerperal Fever at Aylesbury. “Lancet,”\r\n 1835.\r\n\r\nDr. Ramsbotham's Lecture. “London Medical Gazette,” 1835.\r\n\r\nMr. Yates Ackerly's Letter in the same Journal, 1838.\r\n\r\nMr. Ingleby on Epidemic Puerperal Fever. “Edinburgh Medical and Surgical\r\nJournal,” 1838.\r\n\r\nMr. Paley's Letter. “London Medical Gazette,” 1839.\r\n\r\nRemarks at the Medical and Chirurgical Society. “Lancet,” 1840.\r\n\r\nDr. Rigby's “System of Midwifery.” 1841.\r\n\r\n“Nunneley on Erysipelas,”--a work which contains a large number of\r\nreferences on the subject. 1841.\r\n\r\n“British and Foreign Quarterly Review,” 1842.\r\n\r\nDr. S. Jackson of Northumberland, as already quoted from the Summary of\r\nthe College of Physicians, 1842.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, a startling series of cases by Mr. Storrs of Doncaster, to\r\nbe found in the “American Journal of the Medical Sciences” for January,\r\n1843.\r\n\r\nThe relation of puerperal fever with other continued fevers would seem\r\nto be remote and rarely obvious. Hey refers to two cases of synochus\r\noccurring in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, in women who had attended\r\nupon puerperal patients. Dr. Collins refers to several instances\r\nin which puerperal fever has appeared to originate from a continued\r\nproximity to patients suffering with typhus.\r\n\r\nSuch occurrences as those just mentioned, though most important to be\r\nremembered and guarded against, hardly attract our notice in the midst\r\nof the gloomy facts by which they are surrounded. Of these facts, at the\r\nrisk of fatiguing repetitions, I have summoned a sufficient number, as I\r\nbelieve, to convince the most incredulous that every attempt to disguise\r\nthe truth which underlies them all is useless.\r\n\r\nIt is true that some of the historians of the disease, especially\r\nHulme, Hull, and Leake, in England; Tonnelle, Duges, and Baudelocque,\r\nin France, profess not to have found puerperal fever contagious. At the\r\nmost they give us mere negative facts, worthless against an extent of\r\nevidence which now overlaps the widest range of doubt, and doubles\r\nupon itself in the redundancy of superfluous demonstration. Examined in\r\ndetail, this and much of the show of testimony brought up to stare\r\nthe daylight of conviction out of countenance, proves to be in a great\r\nmeasure unmeaning and inapplicable, as might be easily shown were it\r\nnecessary. Nor do I feel the necessity of enforcing the conclusion\r\nwhich arises spontaneously from the facts which have been enumerated, by\r\nformally citing the opinions of those grave authorities who have for the\r\nlast half-century been sounding the unwelcome truth it has cost so many\r\nlives to establish.\r\n\r\n“It is to the British practitioner,” says Dr. Rigby, “that we are\r\nindebted for strongly insisting upon this important and dangerous\r\ncharacter of puerperal fever.”\r\n\r\nThe names of Gordon, John Clarke, Denman, Burns, Young, Hamilton,\r\nHaighton, Good, Waller; Blundell, Gooch, Ramsbotham, Douglas, Lee,\r\nIngleby, Locock, Abercrombie, Alison, Travers, Rigby, and Watson, many\r\nof whose writings I have already referred to, may have some influence\r\nwith those who prefer the weight of authorities to the simple deductions\r\nof their own reason from the facts laid before them. A few Continental\r\nwriters have adopted similar conclusions. It gives me pleasure to\r\nremember, that while the doctrine has been unceremoniously discredited\r\nin one of the leading Journals, and made very light of by teachers in\r\ntwo of the principal Medical Schools, of this country, Dr. Channing has\r\nfor many years inculcated, and enforced by examples, the danger to\r\nbe apprehended and the precautions to be taken in the disease under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nI have no wish to express any harsh feeling with regard to the painful\r\nsubject which has come before us. If there are any so far excited by the\r\nstory of these dreadful events that they ask for some word of indignant\r\nremonstrance to show that science does not turn the hearts of its\r\nfollowers into ice or stone, let me remind them that such words have\r\nbeen uttered by those who speak with an authority I could not claim. It\r\nis as a lesson rather than as a reproach that I call up the memory\r\nof these irreparable errors and wrongs. No tongue can tell the\r\nheart-breaking calamity they have caused; they have closed the eyes\r\njust opened upon a new world of love and happiness; they have bowed the\r\nstrength of manhood into the dust; they have cast the helplessness of\r\ninfancy into the stranger's arms, or bequeathed it, with less cruelty,\r\nthe death of its dying parent. There is no tone deep enough for regret,\r\nand no voice loud enough for warning. The woman about to become a\r\nmother, or with her new-born infant upon her bosom, should be the object\r\nof trembling care and sympathy wherever she bears her tender burden,\r\nor stretches her aching limbs. The very outcast of the streets has pity\r\nupon her sister in degradation, when the seal of promised maternity is\r\nimpressed upon her. The remorseless vengeance of the law, brought down\r\nupon its victim by a machinery as sure as destiny, is arrested in its\r\nfall at a word which reveals her transient claim for mercy. The solemn\r\nprayer of the liturgy singles out her sorrows from the multiplied trials\r\nof life, to plead for her in the hour of peril. God forbid that any\r\nmember of the profession to which she trusts her life, doubly precious\r\nat that eventful period, should hazard it negligently, unadvisedly, or\r\nselfishly!\r\n\r\nThere may be some among those whom I address who are disposed to ask the\r\nquestion, What course are we to follow in relation to this matter? The\r\nfacts are before them, and the answer must be left to their own judgment\r\nand conscience. If any should care to know my own conclusions, they are\r\nthe following; and in taking the liberty to state them very freely and\r\nbroadly, I would ask the inquirer to examine them as freely in the light\r\nof the evidence which has been laid before him.\r\n\r\n1. A physician holding himself in readiness to attend cases of midwifery\r\nshould never take any active part in the post-mortem examination of\r\ncases of puerperal fever.\r\n\r\n2. If a physician is present at such autopsies, he should use thorough\r\nablution, change every article of dress, and allow twenty-four hours or\r\nmore to elapse before attending to any case of midwifery. It may be well\r\nto extend the same caution to cases of simple peritonitis.\r\n\r\n3. Similar precautions should be taken after the autopsy or surgical\r\ntreatment of cases of erysipelas, if the physician is obliged to unite\r\nsuch offices with his obstetrical duties, which is in the highest degree\r\ninexpedient.\r\n\r\n4. On the occurrence of a single case of puerperal fever in his\r\npractice, the physician is bound to consider the next female he attends\r\nin labor, unless some weeks at least have elapsed, as in danger of being\r\ninfected by him, and it is his duty to take every precaution to diminish\r\nher risk of disease and death.\r\n\r\n5. If within a short period two cases of puerperal fever happen close\r\nto each other, in the practice of the same physician, the disease\r\nnot existing or prevailing in the neighborhood, he would do wisely to\r\nrelinquish his obstetrical practice for at least one month, and endeavor\r\nto free himself by every available means from any noxious influence he\r\nmay carry about with him.\r\n\r\n6. The occurrence of three or more closely connected cases, in the\r\npractice of one individual, no others existing in the neighborhood, and\r\nno other sufficient cause being alleged for the coincidence, is prima\r\nfacie evidence that he is the vehicle of contagion.\r\n\r\n7. It is the duty of the physician to take every precaution that the\r\ndisease shall not be introduced by nurses or other assistants, by making\r\nproper inquiries concerning them, and giving timely warning of every\r\nsuspected source of danger.\r\n\r\n8. Whatever indulgence may be granted to those who have heretofore\r\nbeen the ignorant causes of so much misery, the time has come when the\r\nexistence of a private pestilence in the sphere of a single physician\r\nshould be looked upon, not as a misfortune, but a crime; and in the\r\nknowledge of such occurrences the duties of the practitioner to his\r\nprofession should give way to his paramount obligations to society.\r\nADDITIONAL REFERENCES AND CASES.\r\n\r\nFifth Annual Report of the Registrar-General of England.\r\n\r\n1843.

These facts constitute, we may take it for granted,\r\nbut a small fraction of those that have actually occurred. The number of\r\nthem might be greater, but “'t is enough, 't will serve,” in Mercutio's\r\nmodest phrase, so far as frequency is concerned. For a just estimate\r\nof the importance of the singular circumstance, it might be proper to\r\nconsult the languid survivors, the widowed husbands, and the motherless\r\nchildren, as well as “the unfortunate accoucheur.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRENTS AND COUNTER-CURRENTS IN MEDICAL SCIENCE\r\n\r\nAn Address delivered before the Massachusetts Medical Society, at the\r\nAnnual Meeting, May 30, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n        “Facultate magis quam violentia.”\r\n                   HIPPOCRATES.\r\n\r\nOur Annual Meeting never fails to teach us at least one lesson. The art\r\nwhose province it is to heal and to save cannot protect its own ranks\r\nfrom the inroads of disease and the waste of the Destroyer.\r\n\r\nSeventeen of our associates have been taken from us since our last\r\nAnniversary. Most of them followed their calling in the villages or\r\ntowns that lie among the hills or along the inland streams. Only those\r\nwho have lived the kindly, mutually dependent life of the country, can\r\ntell how near the physician who is the main reliance in sickness of all\r\nthe families throughout a thinly settled region comes to the hearts of\r\nthe people among whom he labors, how they value him while living, how\r\nthey cherish his memory when dead. For these friends of ours who have\r\ngone before, there is now no more toil; they start from their slumbers\r\nno more at the cry of pain; they sally forth no more into the storms;\r\nthey ride no longer over the lonely roads that knew them so well; their\r\nwheels are rusting on their axles or rolling with other burdens; their\r\nwatchful eyes are closed to all the sorrows they lived to soothe. Not\r\none of these was famous in the great world; some were almost unknown\r\nbeyond their own immediate circle. But they have left behind them that\r\nloving remembrance which is better than fame, and if their epitaphs are\r\nchiselled briefly in stone, they are written at full length on living\r\ntablets in a thousand homes to which they carried their ever-welcome aid\r\nand sympathy.\r\n\r\nOne whom we have lost, very widely known and honored, was a leading\r\npractitioner of this city. His image can hardly be dimmed in your\r\nrecollection, as he stood before you only three years ago, filling the\r\nsame place with which I am now honored. To speak of him at all worthily,\r\nwould be to write the history of professional success, won without\r\nspecial aid at starting, by toil, patience, good sense, pure character,\r\nand pleasing manners; won in a straight uphill ascent, without one\r\nbreathing-space until he sat down, not to rest, but to die. If prayers\r\ncould have shielded him from the stroke, if love could have drawn forth\r\nthe weapon, and skill could have healed the wound, this passing tribute\r\nmight have been left to other lips and to another generation.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that our dead have at last found that rest which neither\r\nsummer nor winter, nor day nor night, had granted to their unending\r\nearthly labors! And let us remember that our duties to our brethren do\r\nnot cease when they become unable to share our toils, or leave behind\r\nthem in want and woe those whom their labor had supported. It is\r\nhonorable to the Profession that it has organized an Association for the\r\nrelief of its suffering members and their families; it owes this tribute\r\nto the ill-rewarded industry and sacrifices of its less fortunate\r\nbrothers who wear out health and life in the service of humanity. I have\r\ngreat pleasure in referring to this excellent movement, which gives our\r\nliberal profession a chance to show its liberality, and serves to unite\r\nus all, the successful and those whom fortune has cast down, in the\r\nbonds of a true brotherhood.\r\n\r\nA medical man, as he goes about his daily business after twenty years of\r\npractice, is apt to suppose that he treats his patients according to the\r\nteachings of his experience. No doubt this is true to some extent; to\r\nwhat extent depending much on the qualities of the individual. But it\r\nis easy to prove that the prescriptions of even wise physicians are\r\nvery commonly founded on something quite different from experience.\r\nExperience must be based on the permanent facts of nature. But a glance\r\nat the prevalent modes of treatment of any two successive generations\r\nwill show that there is a changeable as well as a permanent element in\r\nthe art of healing; not merely changeable as diseases vary, or as new\r\nremedies are introduced, but changeable by the going out of fashion of\r\nspecial remedies, by the decadence of a popular theory from which their\r\nfitness was deduced, or other cause not more significant. There is no\r\nreason to suppose that the present time is essentially different in\r\nthis respect from any other. Much, therefore, which is now very commonly\r\nconsidered to be the result of experience, will be recognized in the\r\nnext, or in some succeeding generation, as no such result at all, but as\r\na foregone conclusion, based on some prevalent belief or fashion of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, in every calling, those who go about the work of\r\nthe day before them, doing it according to the rules of their craft, and\r\nasking no questions of the past or of the future, or of the aim and end\r\nto which their special labor is contributing. These often consider and\r\ncall themselves practical men. They pull the oars of society, and have\r\nno leisure to watch the currents running this or that way; let theorists\r\nand philosophers attend to them. In the mean time, however, these\r\ncurrents are carrying the practical men, too, and all their work may be\r\nthrown away, and worse than thrown away, if they do not take knowledge\r\nof them and get out of the wrong ones and into the right ones as soon as\r\nthey may. Sir Edward Parry and his party were going straight towards the\r\npole in one of their arctic expeditions, travelling at the rate of ten\r\nmiles a day. But the ice over which they travelled was drifting straight\r\ntowards the equator, at the rate of twelve miles a day, and yet no\r\nman among them would have known that he was travelling two miles a day\r\nbackward unless he had lifted his eyes from the track in which he was\r\nplodding. It is not only going backward that the plain practical workman\r\nis liable to, if he will not look up and look around; he may go forward\r\nto ends he little dreams of. It is a simple business for a mason to\r\nbuild up a niche in a wall; but what if, a hundred years afterwards when\r\nthe wall is torn down, the skeleton of a murdered man drop out of the\r\nniche? It was a plain practical piece of carpentry for a Jewish artisan\r\nto fit two pieces of timber together according to the legal pattern in\r\nthe time of Pontius Pilate; he asked no questions, perhaps, but we know\r\nwhat burden the cross bore on the morrow! And so, with subtler tools\r\nthan trowels or axes, the statesman who works in policy without\r\nprinciple, the theologian who works in forms without a soul, the\r\nphysician who, calling himself a practical man, refuses to recognize the\r\nlarger laws which govern his changing practice, may all find that they\r\nhave been building truth into the wall, and hanging humanity upon the\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that medicine, professedly founded on observation, is as\r\nsensitive to outside influences, political, religious, philosophical,\r\nimaginative, as is the barometer to the changes of atmospheric density.\r\nTheoretically it ought to go on its own straightforward inductive path,\r\nwithout regard to changes of government or to fluctuations of public\r\nopinion. But look a moment while I clash a few facts together, and see\r\nif some sparks do not reveal by their light a closer relation between\r\nthe Medical Sciences and the conditions of Society and the general\r\nthought of the time, than would at first be suspected.\r\n\r\nObserve the coincidences between certain great political and\r\nintellectual periods and the appearance of illustrious medical reformers\r\nand teachers. It was in the age of Pericles, of Socrates, of Plato, of\r\nPhidias, that Hippocrates gave to medical knowledge the form which it\r\nretained for twenty centuries. With the world-conquering Alexander, the\r\nworld-embracing Aristotle, appropriating anatomy and physiology, among\r\nhis manifold spoils of study, marched abreast of his royal pupil to\r\nwider conquests. Under the same Ptolemies who founded the Alexandrian\r\nLibrary and Museum, and ordered the Septuagint version of the Hebrew\r\nScriptures, the infallible Herophilus [“Contradicere Herophilo in\r\nanatomicis, est contradicere evangelium,” was a saying of Fallopius.]\r\nmade those six hundred dissections of which Tertullian accused him, and\r\nthe sagacious Erasistratus introduced his mild antiphlogistic treatment\r\nin opposition to the polypharmacy and antidotal practice of his time.\r\nIt is significant that the large-minded Galen should have been the\r\nphysician and friend of the imperial philosopher Marcus Aurelius. The\r\nArabs gave laws in various branches of knowledge to those whom their\r\narms had invaded, or the terror of their spreading dominion had reached,\r\nand the point from which they started was, as Humboldt acknowledges,\r\n“the study of medicine, by which they long ruled the Christian Schools,”\r\n and to which they added the department of chemical pharmacy.\r\n\r\nLook at Vesalius, the contemporary of Luther. Who can fail to see\r\none common spirit in the radical ecclesiastic and the reforming\r\ncourt-physician? Both still to some extent under the dominion of the\r\nletter: Luther holding to the real presence; Vesalius actually causing\r\nto be drawn and engraved two muscles which he knew were not found in\r\nthe human subject, because they had been described by Galen, from\r\ndissections of the lower animals. Both breaking through old traditions\r\nin the search of truth; one, knife in hand, at the risk of life and\r\nreputation, the other at the risk of fire and fagot, with that mightier\r\nweapon which all the devils could not silence, though they had been\r\nthicker than the tiles on the house-tops. How much the physician of the\r\nCatholic Charles V. had in common with the great religious destructive,\r\nmay be guessed by the relish with which he tells the story how certain\r\nPavian students exhumed the body of an “elegans scortum,” or lovely dame\r\nof ill repute, the favorite of a monk of the order of St. Anthony, who\r\ndoes not seem to have resisted temptation so well as the founder of\r\nhis order. We have always ranked the physician Rabelais among the early\r\nreformers, but I do not know that Vesalius has ever been thanked for his\r\nhit at the morals of the religious orders, or for turning to the good of\r\nscience what was intended for the “benefit of clergy.”\r\n\r\nOur unfortunate medical brother, Michael Servetus, the spiritual patient\r\nto whom the theological moxa was applied over the entire surface for\r\nthe cure of his heresy, came very near anticipating Harvey. The same\r\nquickened thought of the time which led him to dispute the dogma of the\r\nChurch, opened his mind to the facts which contradicted the dogmas of\r\nthe Faculty.\r\n\r\nHarvey himself was but the posthumous child of the great Elizabethan\r\nperiod. Bacon was at once his teacher and his patient. The founder\r\nof the new inductive philosophy had only been dead two years when the\r\ntreatise on the Circulation, the first-fruit of the Restoration of\r\nScience, was given to the world.\r\n\r\nAnd is it to be looked at as a mere accidental coincidence, that while\r\nNapoleon was modernizing the political world, Bichat was revolutionizing\r\nthe science of life and the art that is based upon it; that while the\r\nyoung general was scaling the Alps, the young surgeon was climbing\r\nthe steeper summits of unexplored nature; that the same year read the\r\nannouncement of those admirable “Researches on Life and Death,” and the\r\nbulletins of the battle of Marengo?\r\n\r\nIf we come to our own country, who can fail to recognize that Benjamin\r\nRush, the most conspicuous of American physicians, was the intellectual\r\noffspring of the movement which produced the Revolution? “The same\r\nhand,” says one of his biographers, “which subscribed the declaration\r\nof the political independence of these States, accomplished their\r\nemancipation from medical systems formed in foreign countries, and\r\nwholly unsuitable to the state of diseases in America.”\r\n\r\nFollowing this general course of remark, I propose to indicate in a few\r\nwords the direction of the main intellectual current of the time, and\r\nto point out more particularly some of the eddies which tend to keep the\r\nscience and art of medicine from moving with it, or even to carry them\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\nThe two dominant words of our time are law and average, both pointing to\r\nthe uniformity of the order of being in which we live. Statistics have\r\ntabulated everything,--population, growth, wealth, crime, disease. We\r\nhave shaded maps showing the geographical distribution of larceny and\r\nsuicide. Analysis and classification have been at work upon all tangible\r\nand visible objects. The Positive Philosophy of Comte has only given\r\nexpression to the observing and computing mind of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the great stronghold of intellectual conservatism,\r\ntraditional belief, has been assailed by facts which would have been\r\nindicted as blasphemy but a few generations ago. Those new tables of\r\nthe law, placed in the hands of the geologist by the same living God who\r\nspoke from Sinai to the Israelites of old, have remodelled the beliefs\r\nof half the civilized world. The solemn scepticism of science has\r\nreplaced the sneering doubts of witty philosophers. The more positive\r\nknowledge we gain, the more we incline to question all that has been\r\nreceived without absolute proof.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, this movement has its partial reactions. The\r\nprovince of faith is claimed as a port free of entry to unsupported\r\nindividual convictions. The tendency to question is met by the\r\nunanalyzing instinct of reverence. The old church calls back its\r\nfrightened truants. Some who have lost their hereditary religious\r\nbelief find a resource in the revelations of Spiritualism. By a parallel\r\nmovement, some of those who have become medical infidels pass over to\r\nthe mystic band of believers in the fancied miracles of Homoeopathy.\r\n\r\nUnder these influences transmitted to, or at least shared by, the\r\nmedical profession, the old question between “Nature,” so called, and\r\n“Art,” or professional tradition, has reappeared with new interest. I\r\nsay the old question, for Hippocrates stated the case on the side\r\nof “Nature” more than two thousand years ago. Miss Florence\r\nNightingale,--and if I name her next to the august Father of the Healing\r\nArt, its noblest daughter well deserves that place of honor,--Miss\r\nFlorence Nightingale begins her late volume with a paraphrase of his\r\nstatement. But from a very early time to this there has always been\r\na strong party against “Nature.” Themison called the practice of\r\nHippocrates “a meditation upon death.” Dr. Rush says: “It is impossible\r\nto calculate the mischief which Hippocrates has done, by first marking\r\nNature with his name and afterwards letting her loose upon sick people.\r\nMillions have perished by her hands in all ages and countries.” Sir John\r\nForbes, whose defence of “Nature” in disease you all know, and to the\r\ntestimonial in whose honor four of your Presidents have contributed, has\r\nbeen recently greeted, on retiring from the profession, with a wish that\r\nhis retirement had been twenty years sooner, and the opinion that no man\r\nhad done so much to destroy the confidence of the public in the medical\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nIn this Society we have had the Hippocratic and the Themisonic side\r\nfairly represented. The treatise of one of your early Presidents on the\r\nMercurial Treatment is familiar to my older listeners. Others who have\r\nheld the same office have been noted for the boldness of their practice,\r\nand even for partiality to the use of complex medication.\r\n\r\nOn the side of “Nature” we have had, first of all, that remarkable\r\ndiscourse on Self-Limited Diseases, [On Self-Limited Diseases. A\r\nDiscourse delivered before the Massachusetts Medical Society, at their\r\nAnnual Meeting, May 27, 1835. By Jacob Bigelow, M. D.] which has given\r\nthe key-note to the prevailing medical tendency of this neighborhood, at\r\nleast, for the quarter of a century since it was delivered. Nor have\r\nwe forgotten the address delivered at Springfield twenty years later,\r\n[Search out the Secrets, of Nature. By Augustus A. Gould, M. D. Read\r\nat the Annual Meeting, June 27, 1855.] full of good sense and useful\r\nsuggestions, to one of which suggestions we owe the learned, impartial,\r\njudicious, well-written Prize Essay of Dr. Worthington Hooker. [Rational\r\nTherapeutics. A Prize Essay. By Worthington Hooker, M. D., of New Haven.\r\nBoston. 1857.] We should not omit from the list the important address of\r\nanother of our colleagues, [On the Treatment of Compound and Complicated\r\nFractures. By William J. Walker, M. D. Read at the Annual Meeting, May\r\n29, 1845.] showing by numerous cases the power of Nature in\r\nhealing compound fractures to be much greater than is frequently\r\nsupposed,--affording, indeed, more striking illustrations than can be\r\nobtained from the history of visceral disease, of the supreme wisdom,\r\nforethought, and adaptive dexterity of that divine Architect, as shown\r\nin repairing the shattered columns which support the living temple of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nWe who are on the side of “Nature” please ourselves with the idea that\r\nwe are in the great current in which the true intelligence of the time\r\nis moving. We believe that some who oppose, or fear, or denounce our\r\nmovement are themselves caught in various eddies that set back against\r\nthe truth. And we do most earnestly desire and most actively strive,\r\nthat Medicine, which, it is painful to remember, has been spoken of\r\nas “the withered branch of science” at a meeting of the British\r\nAssociation, shall be at length brought fully to share, if not to lead,\r\nthe great wave of knowledge which rolls with the tides that circle the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nIf there is any State or city which might claim to be the American\r\nheadquarters of the nature-trusting heresy, provided it be one, that\r\nState is Massachusetts, and that city is its capital. The effect which\r\nthese doctrines have upon the confidence reposed in the profession is a\r\nmatter of opinion. For myself, I do not believe this confidence can be\r\nimpaired by any investigations which tend to limit the application of\r\ntroublesome, painful, uncertain, or dangerous remedies. Nay, I will\r\nventure to say this, that if every specific were to fail utterly, if the\r\ncinchona trees all died out, and the arsenic mines were exhausted, and\r\nthe sulphur regions were burned up, if every drug from the vegetable,\r\nanimal, and mineral kingdom were to disappear from the market, a body of\r\nenlightened men, organized as a distinct profession, would be required\r\njust as much as now, and respected and trusted as now, whose province\r\nshould be to guard against the causes of disease, to eliminate them if\r\npossible when still present, to order all the conditions of the patient\r\nso as to favor the efforts of the system to right itself, and to give\r\nthose predictions of the course of disease which only experience can\r\nwarrant, and which in so many cases relieve the exaggerated fears of\r\nsufferers and their friends, or warn them in season of impending danger.\r\nGreat as the loss would be if certain active remedies could no longer be\r\nobtained, it would leave the medical profession the most essential part\r\nof its duties, and all, and more than all, its present share of honors;\r\nfor it would be the death-blow to charlatanism, which depends for its\r\nsuccess almost entirely on drugs, or at least on a nomenclature that\r\nsuggests them.\r\n\r\nThere is no offence, then, or danger in expressing the opinion, that,\r\nafter all which has been said, the community is still overdosed: The\r\nbest proof of it is, that “no families take so little medicine as those\r\nof doctors, except those of apothecaries, and that old practitioners are\r\nmore sparing of active medicines than younger ones.” [Dr. James Jackson\r\nhas kindly permitted me to make the following extract from a letter\r\njust received by him from Sir James Clark, and dated May 26, 1860: “As a\r\nphysician advances in age, he generally, I think, places less confidence\r\nin the ordinary medical treatment than he did, not only during his\r\nearly, but even his middle period of life.”] The conclusion from these\r\nfacts is one which the least promising of Dr. Howe's pupils in the\r\nmental department could hardly help drawing.\r\n\r\nPart of the blame of over-medication must, I fear, rest with the\r\nprofession, for yielding to the tendency to self-delusion, which seems\r\ninseparable from the practice of the art of healing. I need only touch\r\non the common modes of misunderstanding or misapplying the evidence of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the natural incapacity for sound observation, which is\r\nlike a faulty ear in music. We see this in many persons who know a good\r\ndeal about books, but who are not sharp-sighted enough to buy a horse or\r\ndeal with human diseases.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is in some persons a singular inability to weigh the\r\nvalue of testimony; of which, I think, from a pretty careful examination\r\nof his books, Hahnemann affords the best specimen outside the walls of\r\nBedlam.\r\n\r\nThe inveterate logical errors to which physicians have always been\r\nsubject are chiefly these:\r\n\r\nThe mode of inference per enumerationem simplicem, in scholastic phrase;\r\nthat is, counting only their favorable cases. This is the old trick\r\nillustrated in Lord Bacon's story of the gifts of the shipwrecked\r\npeople, hung up in the temple.--Behold! they vowed these gifts to the\r\naltar, and the gods saved them. Ay, said a doubting bystander, but\r\nhow many made vows of gifts and were shipwrecked notwithstanding? The\r\nnumerical system is the best corrective of this and similar errors. The\r\narguments commonly brought against its application to all matters of\r\nmedical observation, treatment included, seem to apply rather to the\r\ntabulation of facts ill observed, or improperly classified, than to the\r\nmethod itself.\r\n\r\nThe post hoc ergo propter hoc error: he got well after taking my\r\nmedicine; therefore in consequence of taking it.\r\n\r\nThe false induction from genuine facts of observation, leading to the\r\nconstruction of theories which are then deductively applied in the\r\nface of the results of direct observation. The school of Broussais has\r\nfurnished us with a good example of this error.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the error which Sir Thomas Browne calls giving “a reason of\r\nthe golden tooth;” that is, assuming a falsehood as a fact, and giving\r\nreasons for it, commonly fanciful ones, as is constantly done by that\r\nclass of incompetent observers who find their “golden tooth” in the\r\nfabulous effects of the homoeopathie materia medica,--which consists of\r\nsugar of milk and a nomenclature.\r\n\r\nAnother portion of the blame rests with the public itself, which insists\r\non being poisoned. Somebody buys all the quack medicines that build\r\npalaces for the mushroom, say rather, the toadstool millionaires. Who is\r\nit? These people have a constituency of millions. The popular belief is\r\nall but universal that sick persons should feed on noxious substances.\r\nOne of our members was called not long since to a man with a terribly\r\nsore mouth. On inquiry he found that the man had picked up a box of\r\nunknown pills, in Howard Street, and had proceeded to take them, on\r\ngeneral principles, pills being good for people. They happened to\r\ncontain mercury, and hence the trouble for which he consulted our\r\nassociate.\r\n\r\nThe outside pressure, therefore, is immense upon the physician,\r\ntending to force him to active treatment of some kind. Certain old\r\nsuperstitions, still lingering in the mind of the public, and not yet\r\nutterly expelled from that of the profession, are at the bottom of this,\r\nor contribute to it largely. One of the most ancient is, that disease is\r\na malignant agency, or entity, to be driven out of the body by offensive\r\nsubstances, as the smoke of the fish's heart and liver drove the devil\r\nout of Tobit's bridal chamber, according to the Apochrypha. Epileptics\r\nused to suck the blood from the wounds of dying gladiators. [Plinii\r\nHist. Mundi. lib. xxviii. c. 4.] The Hon. Robert Boyle's little book\r\nwas published some twenty or thirty years before our late President, Dr.\r\nHolyoke, was born. [A Collection of Choice and Safe Remedies. The Fifth\r\nEdition, corrected. London, 1712. Dr. Holyoke was born in 1728.] In it\r\nhe recommends, as internal medicines, most of the substances commonly\r\nused as fertilizers of the soil. His “Album Graecum” is best\r\nleft untranslated, and his “Zebethum Occidentale” is still more\r\ntranscendentally unmentionable except in a strange dialect. It sounds\r\nodiously to us to hear him recommend for dysentery a powder made from\r\n“the sole of an old shoe worn by some man that walks much.” Perhaps\r\nnobody here ever heard of tying a stocking, which had been worn during\r\nthe day, round the neck at night for a sore throat. The same idea\r\nof virtue in unlovely secretions! [The idea is very ancient. “Sordes\r\nhominis” “Sudore et oleo medicinam facientibus.”--Plin. xxviii. 4.]\r\n\r\nEven now the Homoeopathists have been introducing the venom of serpents,\r\nunder the learned title of Lachesis, and outraging human nature with\r\ninfusions of the pediculus capitis; that is, of course, as we understand\r\ntheir dilutions, the names of these things; for if a fine-tooth-comb\r\ninsect were drowned in Lake Superior, we cannot agree with them in\r\nthinking that every drop of its waters would be impregnated with all the\r\npedicular virtues they so highly value. They know what they are doing.\r\nThey are appealing to the detestable old superstitious presumption in\r\nfavor of whatever is nauseous and noxious as being good for the sick.\r\n\r\nAgain, we all occasionally meet persons stained with nitrate of silver,\r\ngiven for epilepsy. Read what Dr. Martin says, about the way in which\r\nit came to be used, in his excellent address before the Norfolk County\r\nMedical Society, and the evidence I can show, but have not time for now,\r\nand then say what you think of the practice which on such presumptions\r\nturns a white man as blue as the double-tattooed King of the Cannibal\r\nIslands! [Note A.]\r\n\r\nIf medical superstitions have fought their way down through all the\r\nrationalism and scepticism of the nineteenth century, of course the\r\ntheories of the schools, supported by great names, adopted into the\r\npopular belief and incorporated with the general mass of misapprehension\r\nwith reference to disease, must be expected to meet us at every turn in\r\nthe shape of bad practice founded on false doctrine. A French patient\r\ncomplains that his blood heats him, and expects his doctor to bleed\r\nhim. An English or American one says he is bilious, and will not be easy\r\nwithout a dose of calomel. A doctor looks at a patient's tongue, sees it\r\ncoated, and says the stomach is foul; his head full of the old saburral\r\nnotion which the extreme inflammation-doctrine of Broussais did so\r\nmuch to root out, but which still leads, probably, to much needless and\r\ninjurious wrong of the stomach and bowels by evacuants, when all they\r\nwant is to be let alone. It is so hard to get anything out of the dead\r\nhand of medical tradition! The mortmain of theorists extinct in science\r\nclings as close as that of ecclesiastics defunct in law.\r\n\r\nOne practical hint may not be out of place here. It seems to be\r\nsometimes forgotten, by those who must know the fact, that the tongue is\r\nvery different, anatomically and physiologically, from the stomach.\r\nIts condition does not in the least imply a similar one of the stomach,\r\nwhich is a very different structure, covered with a different kind\r\nof epithelium, and furnished with entirely different secretions. A\r\nsilversmith will, for a dollar, make a small hoe, of solid silver, which\r\nwill last for centuries, and will give a patient more comfort, used\r\nfor the removal of the accumulated epithelium and fungous growths which\r\nconstitute the “fur,” than many a prescription with a split-footed Rx\r\nbefore it, addressed to the parts out of reach.\r\n\r\nI think more of this little implement on account of its agency in saving\r\nthe Colony at Plymouth in the year 1623. Edward Winslow heard that\r\nMassasoit was sick and like to die. He found him with a houseful of\r\npeople about him, women rubbing his arms and legs, and friends “making\r\nsuch a hellish noise” as they probably thought would scare away the\r\ndevil of sickness. Winslow gave him some conserve, washed his mouth,\r\nscraped his tongue, which was in a horrid state, got down some drink,\r\nmade him some broth, dosed him with an infusion of strawberry leaves and\r\nsassafras root, and had the satisfaction of seeing him rapidly recover.\r\nMassasoit, full of gratitude, revealed the plot which had been formed\r\nto destroy the colonists, whereupon the Governor ordered Captain Miles\r\nStandish to see to them; who thereupon, as everybody remembers, stabbed\r\nPecksuot with his own knife, broke up the plot, saved the colony, and\r\nthus rendered Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Medical Society\r\na possibility, as they now are a fact before us. So much for this\r\nparenthesis of the tongue-scraper, which helped to save the young\r\ncolony from a much more serious scrape, and may save the Union yet, if a\r\nPresidential candidate should happen to be taken sick as Massasoit was,\r\nand his tongue wanted cleaning,--which process would not hurt a good\r\nmany politicians, with or without a typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nAgain, see how the “bilious” theory works in every-day life here and\r\nnow, illustrated by a case from actual life. A youthful practitioner,\r\nwhose last molars have not been a great while cut, meets an experienced\r\nand noted physician in consultation. This is the case. A slender,\r\nlymphatic young woman is suckling two lusty twins, the intervals\r\nof suction being occupied on her part with palpitations, headaches,\r\ngiddiness, throbbing in the head, and various nervous symptoms, her\r\ncheeks meantime getting bloodless, and her strength running away\r\nin company with her milk. The old experienced physician, seeing the\r\nyellowish waxy look which is common in anaemic patients, considers it a\r\n“bilious” case, and is for giving a rousing emetic. Of course, he has to\r\nbe wheedled out of this, a recipe is written for beefsteaks and porter,\r\nthe twins are ignominiously expelled from the anaemic bosom, and forced\r\nto take prematurely to the bottle, and this prolific mother is saved for\r\nfuture usefulness in the line of maternity.\r\n\r\nThe practice of making a profit on the medicine ordered has been held up\r\nto reprobation by one at least of the orators who have preceded me. That\r\nthe effect of this has been ruinous in English practice I cannot\r\ndoubt, and that in this country the standard of practice was in former\r\ngenerations lowered through the same agency is not unlikely. I have seen\r\nan old account-book in which the physician charged an extra price for\r\ngilding his rich patients' pills. If all medicine were very costly,\r\nand the expense of it always came out of the physician's fee, it\r\nwould really be a less objectionable arrangement than this other most\r\npernicious one. He would naturally think twice before he gave an emetic\r\nor cathartic which evacuated his own pocket, and be sparing of the\r\ncholagogues that emptied the biliary ducts of his own wallet, unless he\r\nwere sure they were needed. If there is any temptation, it should not be\r\nin favor of giving noxious agents, as it clearly must be in the case of\r\nEnglish druggists and “General Practitioners.” The complaint against\r\nthe other course is a very old one. Pliny, inspired with as truly Roman\r\nhorror of quackery as the elder Cato,--who declared that the Greek\r\ndoctors had sworn to exterminate all barbarians, including the Romans,\r\nwith their drugs, but is said to have physicked his own wife to death,\r\nnotwithstanding,--Pliny says, in so many words, that the cerates and\r\ncataplasms, plasters, collyria, and antidotes, so abundant in his time,\r\nas in more recent days, were mere tricks to make money.\r\n\r\nA pretty strong eddy, then, or rather many eddies, setting constantly\r\nback from the current of sober observation of nature, in the direction\r\nof old superstitions and fancies, of exploded theories, of old ways of\r\nmaking money, which are very slow to pass out of fashion.\r\n\r\nBut there are other special American influences which we are bound to\r\ntake cognizance of. If I wished to show a student the difficulties of\r\ngetting at truth from medical experience, I would give him the history\r\nof epilepsy to read. If I wished him to understand the tendencies of the\r\nAmerican medical mind, its sanguine enterprise, its self-confidence, its\r\naudacious handling of Nature, its impatience with her old-fashioned ways\r\nof taking time to get a sick man well, I would make him read the life\r\nand writings of Benjamin Rush. Dr. Rush thought and said that there were\r\ntwenty times more intellect and a hundred times more knowledge in\r\nthe country in 1799 than before the Revolution. His own mind was in a\r\nperpetual state of exaltation produced by the stirring scenes in which\r\nhe had taken a part, and the quickened life of the time in which he\r\nlived. It was not the state to favor sound, calm observation. He was\r\nimpatient, and Nature is profoundly imperturbable. We may adjust the\r\nbeating of our hearts to her pendulum if we will and can, but we may be\r\nvery sure that she will not change the pendulum's rate of going because\r\nour hearts are palpitating. He thought he had mastered yellow-fever.\r\n“Thank God,” he said, “out of one hundred patients whom I have visited\r\nor prescribed for this day, I have lost none.” Where was all his legacy\r\nof knowledge when Norfolk was decimated? Where was it when the blue\r\nflies were buzzing over the coffins of the unburied dead piled up in\r\nthe cemetery of New Orleans, at the edge of the huge trenches yawning to\r\nreceive them?\r\n\r\nOne such instance will do as well as twenty. Dr. Rush must have been a\r\ncharming teacher, as he was an admirable man. He was observing, rather\r\nthan a sound observer; eminently observing, curious, even, about all\r\nmanner of things. But he could not help feeling as if Nature had been a\r\ngood deal shaken by the Declaration of Independence, and that\r\nAmerican art was getting to be rather too much for her,--especially\r\nas illustrated in his own practice. He taught thousands of American\r\nstudents, he gave a direction to the medical mind of the country more\r\nthan any other one man; perhaps he typifies it better than any other. It\r\nhas clearly tended to extravagance in remedies and trust in remedies,\r\nas in everything else. How could a people which has a revolution once in\r\nfour years, which has contrived the Bowie-knife and the revolver, which\r\nhas chewed the juice out of all the superlatives in the language in\r\nFourth of July orations, and so used up its epithets in the rhetoric of\r\nabuse that it takes two great quarto dictionaries to supply the demand;\r\nwhich insists in sending out yachts and horses and boys to out-sail,\r\nout-run, out-fight, and checkmate all the rest of creation; how could\r\nsuch a people be content with any but “heroic” practice? What wonder\r\nthat the stars and stripes wave over doses of ninety grains of sulphate\r\nof quinine, [More strictly, ninety-six grains in two hours. Dunglison's\r\nPractice, 1842, vol. ii. p. 520. Eighty grains in one dose. Ibid. p.\r\n536. Ninety-six grains of sulphate of quinine are equal to eight ounces\r\nof good bark.--Wood & Bache.] and that the American eagle screams with\r\ndelight to see three drachms of calomel given at a single mouthful?\r\n\r\nAdd to this the great number of Medical Journals, all useful, we\r\nhope, most of them necessary, we trust, many of them excellently well\r\nconducted, but which must find something to fill their columns, and so\r\nprint all the new plans of treatment and new remedies they can get hold\r\nof, as the newspapers, from a similar necessity, print the shocking\r\ncatastrophes and terrible murders.\r\n\r\nBesides all this, here are we, the great body of teachers in the\r\nnumberless medical schools of the Union, some of us lecturing to crowds\r\nwho clap and stamp in the cities, some of us wandering over the country,\r\nlike other professional fertilizers, to fecundate the minds of less\r\ndemonstrative audiences at various scientific stations; all of us\r\ntalking habitually to those supposed to know less than ourselves, and\r\nloving to claim as much for our art as we can, not to say for our own\r\nschools, and possibly indirectly for our own practical skill. Hence that\r\nannual crop of introductory lectures; the useful blossoming into the\r\nornamental, as the cabbage becomes glorified in the cauliflower; that\r\nlecture-room literature of adjectives, that declamatory exaggeration,\r\nthat splendid show of erudition borrowed from D'Israeli, and credited\r\nto Lord Bacon and the rest, which have suggested to our friends of\r\nthe Medical Journals an occasional epigram at our expense. Hence the\r\ntendency in these productions, and in medical lectures generally,\r\nto overstate the efficacy of favorite methods of cure, and hence the\r\npremium offered for showy talkers rather than sagacious observers,\r\nfor the men of adjectives rather than of nouns substantive in the more\r\nambitious of these institutions.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the eddies in which we are liable to become involved\r\nand carried back out of the broad stream of philosophical, or, in other\r\nwords, truth-loving, investigations. The causes of disease, in the mean\r\ntime, have been less earnestly studied in the eagerness of the search\r\nfor remedies. Speak softly! Women have been borne out from an old-world\r\nhospital, two in one coffin, that the horrors of their prison-house\r\nmight not be known, while the very men who were discussing the treatment\r\nof the disease were stupidly conveying the infection from bed to bed,\r\nas rat-killers carry their poisons from one household to another. Do not\r\nsome of you remember that I have had to fight this private-pestilence\r\nquestion against a scepticism which sneered in the face of a mass of\r\nevidence such as the calm statisticians of the Insurance office could\r\nnot listen to without horror and indignation? [“The Contagiousness of\r\nPuerperal Fever.”--N. E. Quar. Jour. of Medicine and Surgery, April,\r\n1843. Reprinted, with Additions. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1855.] Have\r\nwe forgotten what is told in one of the books published under our own\r\nsanction, that a simple measure of ventilation, proposed by Dr. John\r\nClark, had saved more than sixteen thousand children's lives in a\r\nsingle hospital? How long would it have taken small doses of calomel and\r\nrhubarb to save as many children? These may be useful in prudent hands,\r\nbut how insignificant compared to the great hygienic conditions! Causes,\r\ncauses, and again causes,--more and more we fall back on these as the\r\nchief objects of our attention. The shortest system of medical practice\r\nthat I know of is the oldest, but not the worst. It is older than\r\nHippocrates, older than Chiron the Centaur. Nature taught it to the\r\nfirst mother when she saw her first-born child putting some ugly pebble\r\nor lurid berry into its mouth. I know not in what language it was\r\nspoken, but I know that in English it would sound thus: Spit it out!\r\n\r\nArt can do something more than say this. It can sometimes reach the\r\npebble or berry after it has been swallowed. But the great thing is\r\nto keep these things out of children's mouths, and as soon as they are\r\nbeyond our reach, to be reasonable and patient with Nature, who means\r\nwell, but does not like to hurry, and who took nine calendar months,\r\nmore or less, to every mother's son among us, before she thought he was\r\nfit to be shown to the public.\r\n\r\nSuffer me now to lay down a few propositions, whether old or new it\r\nmatters little, not for your immediate acceptance, nor yet for your\r\nhasty rejection, but for your calm consideration.\r\n\r\nBut first, there are a number of terms which we are in the habit of\r\nusing in a vague though not unintelligible way, and which it is as well\r\nnow to define. These terms are the tools with which we are to work, and\r\nthe first thing is to sharpen them. It is nothing to us that they have\r\nbeen sharpened a thousand times before; they always get dull in the\r\nusing, and every new workman has a right to carry them to the grindstone\r\nand sharpen them to suit himself.\r\n\r\nNature, in medical language, as opposed to Art, means trust in the\r\nreactions of the living system against ordinary normal impressions.\r\n\r\nArt, in the same language, as opposed to Nature, means an intentional\r\nresort to extraordinary abnormal impressions for the relief of disease.\r\n\r\nThe reaction of the living system is the essence of both. Food is\r\nnothing, if there is no digestive act to respond to it. We cannot raise\r\na blister on a dead man, or hope that a carminative forced between his\r\nlips will produce its ordinary happy effect.\r\n\r\nDisease, dis-ease,--disturbed quiet, uncomfortableness,--means imperfect\r\nor abnormal reaction of the living system, and its more or less\r\npermanent results.\r\n\r\nFood, in its largest sense, is whatever helps to build up the normal\r\nstructures, or to maintain their natural actions.\r\n\r\nMedicine, in distinction from food, is every unnatural or noxious agent\r\napplied for the relief of disease.\r\n\r\nPhysic means properly the Natural art, and Physician is only the Greek\r\nsynonyme of Naturalist.\r\n\r\nWith these few explanations I proceed to unfold the propositions I have\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nDisease and death, if we may judge by the records of creation, are\r\ninherently and essentially necessary in the present order of things. A\r\nperfect intelligence, trained by a perfect education, could do no more\r\nthan keep the laws of the physical and spiritual universe. An imperfect\r\nintelligence, imperfectly taught,--and this is the condition of our\r\nfinite humanity,--will certainly fail to keep all these laws perfectly.\r\nDisease is one of the penalties of one of the forms of such failure. It\r\nis prefigured in the perturbations of the planets, in the disintegration\r\nof the elemental masses; it has left its traces in the fossil organisms\r\nof extinct creations. [Professor Agassiz has kindly handed me the\r\nfollowing note: “There are abnormal structures in animals of all ages\r\nanterior to the creation of mankind. Malformed specimens of Crinoids are\r\nknown from the Triassic and Jurassic deposits. Malformed and diseased\r\nbones of tertiary mammalia have been collected in the caverns of\r\nGailenreuth with traces of healing.”]\r\n\r\nBut it is especially the prerogative, I had almost said privilege, of\r\neducated and domesticated beings, from man down to the potato, serving\r\nto teach them, and such as train them, the laws of life, and to get rid\r\nof those who will not mind or cannot be kept subject to these laws.\r\n\r\nDisease, being always an effect, is always in exact proportion to the\r\nsum of its causes, as much in the case of Spigelius, who dies of a\r\nscratch, as in that of the man who recovers after an iron bar has been\r\nshot through his brain. The one prevalent failing of the medical art is\r\nto neglect the causes and quarrel with the effect.\r\n\r\nThere are certain general facts which include a good deal of what is\r\ncalled and treated as disease. Thus, there are two opposite movements of\r\nlife to be seen in cities and elsewhere, belonging to races which, from\r\nvarious persistent causes, are breeding down and tending to run out,\r\nand to races which are breeding up, or accumulating vital capital,--a\r\ndescending and an ascending series. Let me give an example of each; and\r\nthat I may incidentally remove a common impression about this country as\r\ncompared with the Old World, an impression which got tipsy with conceit\r\nand staggered into the attitude of a formal proposition in the work of\r\nDr. Robert Knox, I will illustrate the downward movement from English\r\nexperience, and the upward movement from a family history belonging to\r\nthis immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale speaks of “the fact so often seen of a\r\ngreat-grandmother, who was a tower of physical vigor, descending into a\r\ngrandmother perhaps a little less vigorous, but still sound as a bell,\r\nand healthy to the core, into a mother languid and confined to her\r\ncarriage and house; and lastly into a daughter sickly and confined\r\nto her bed.” So much for the descending English series; now for the\r\nascending American series.\r\n\r\nSomething more than one hundred and thirty years ago there graduated at\r\nHarvard College a delicate youth, who lived an invalid life and died at\r\nthe age of about fifty. His two children were both of moderate physical\r\npower, and one of them diminutive in stature. The next generation rose\r\nin physical development, and reached eighty years of age and more\r\nin some of its members. The fourth generation was of fair average\r\nendowment. The fifth generation, great-great-grandchildren of the\r\nslender invalid, are several of, them of extraordinary bodily and mental\r\npower; large in stature, formidable alike with their brains and their\r\narms, organized on a more extensive scale than either of their parents.\r\n\r\nThis brief account illustrates incidentally the fallacy of the\r\nuniversal-degeneration theory applied to American life; the same on\r\nwhich one of our countrymen has lately brought some very forcible facts\r\nto bear in a muscular discussion of which we have heard rather more than\r\nis good for us. But the two series, American and English, ascending and\r\ndescending, were adduced with the main purpose of showing the immense\r\ndifference of vital endowments in different strains of blood; a\r\ndifference to which all ordinary medication is in all probability a\r\nmatter of comparatively trivial purport. Many affections which art has\r\nto strive against might be easily shown to be vital to the well-being of\r\nsociety. Hydrocephalus, tabes mesenterica, and other similar maladies,\r\nare natural agencies which cut off the children of races that are\r\nsinking below the decent minimum which nature has established as the\r\ncondition of viability, before they reach the age of reproduction.\r\nThey are really not so much diseases, as manifestations of congenital\r\nincapacity for life; the race would be ruined if art could ever learn\r\nalways to preserve the individuals subject to them. We must do the best\r\nwe can for them, but we ought also to know what these “diseases” mean.\r\n\r\nAgain, invalidism is the normal state of many organizations. It can\r\nbe changed to disease, but never to absolute health by medicinal\r\nappliances. There are many ladies, ancient and recent, who are\r\nperpetually taking remedies for irremediable pains and aches. They ought\r\nto have headaches and back-aches and stomach-aches; they are not well if\r\nthey do not have them. To expect them to live without frequent twinges\r\nis like expecting a doctor's old chaise to go without creaking; if it\r\ndid, we might be sure the springs were broken. There is no doubt that\r\nthe constant demand for medicinal remedies from patients of this class\r\nleads to their over-use; often in the case of cathartics, sometimes in\r\nthat of opiates. I have been told by an intelligent practitioner in\r\na Western town, that the constant prescription of opiates by certain\r\nphysicians in his vicinity has rendered the habitual use of that drug\r\nin all that region very prevalent; more common, I should think, than\r\nalcoholic drunkenness in the most intemperate localities of which I have\r\nknown anything. A frightful endemic demoralization betrays itself in the\r\nfrequency with which the haggard features and drooping shoulders of the\r\nopium-drunkards are met with in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe next proposition I would ask you to consider is this: The\r\npresumption always is that every noxious agent, including medicines\r\nproper, which hurts a well man, hurts a sick one. [Note B.]\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate this proposition before you decide upon it. If it were\r\nknown that a prize-fighter were to have a drastic purgative administered\r\ntwo or three days before a contest, or a large blister applied to his\r\nback, no one will question that it would affect the betting on his side\r\nunfavorably; we will say to the amount of five per cent. Now the drain\r\nupon the resources of the system produced in such a case must be at its\r\nminimum, for the subject is a powerful man, in the prime of life, and\r\nin admirable condition. If the drug or the blister takes five per cent.\r\nfrom his force of resistance, it will take at least as large a fraction\r\nfrom any invalid. But this invalid has to fight a champion who strikes\r\nhard but cannot be hit in return, who will press him sharply for breath,\r\nbut will never pant himself while the wind can whistle through his\r\nfleshless ribs. The suffering combatant is liable to want all his\r\nstamina, and five per cent. may lose him the battle.\r\n\r\nAll noxious agents, all appliances which are not natural food or\r\nstimuli, all medicines proper, cost a patient, on the average, five\r\nper cent. of his vital force, let us say. Twenty times as much waste of\r\nforce produced by any of them, that is, would exactly kill him, nothing\r\nless than kill him, and nothing more. If this, or something like this,\r\nis true, then all these medications are, prima facie, injurious.\r\n\r\nIn the game of Life-or-Death, Rouge et Noir, as played between the\r\nDoctor and the Sexton, this five per cent., this certain small injury\r\nentering into the chances is clearly the sexton's perquisite for keeping\r\nthe green table, over which the game is played, and where he hoards\r\nup his gains. Suppose a blister to diminish a man's pain, effusion or\r\ndyspnoea to the saving of twenty per cent. in vital force; his profit\r\nfrom it is fifteen, in that case, for it always hurts him five to begin\r\nwith, according to our previous assumption.\r\n\r\nPresumptions are of vast importance in medicine, as in law. A man is\r\npresumed innocent until he is proved guilty. A medicine--that is,\r\na noxious agent, like a blister, a seton, an emetic, or a cathartic\r\n--should always be presumed to be hurtful. It always is directly\r\nhurtful; it may sometimes be indirectly beneficial. If this presumption\r\nwere established, and disease always assumed to be the innocent victim\r\nof circumstances, and not punishable by medicines, that is, noxious\r\nagents, or poisons, until the contrary was shown, we should not so\r\nfrequently hear the remark commonly, perhaps erroneously, attributed to\r\nSir Astley Cooper, but often repeated by sensible persons, that, on the\r\nwhole, more harm than good is done by medication. Throw out opium, which\r\nthe Creator himself seems to prescribe, for we often see the scarlet\r\npoppy growing in the cornfields, as if it were foreseen that wherever\r\nthere is hunger to be fed there must also be pain to be soothed; throw\r\nout a few specifics which our art did not discover, and is hardly needed\r\nto apply [ Note C.]; throw out wine, which is a food, and the vapors\r\nwhich produce the miracle of anaesthesia, and I firmly believe that if\r\nthe whole materia medica, as now used, could be sunk to the bottom of\r\nthe sea, it would be all the better for mankind,--and all the worse for\r\nthe fishes.\r\n\r\nBut to justify this proposition, I must add that the injuries inflicted\r\nby over-medication are to a great extent masked by disease. Dr. Hooker\r\nbelieves that the typhus syncopatia of a preceding generation in\r\nNew England “was often in fact a brandy and opium disease.” How is a\r\nphysician to distinguish the irritation produced by his blister from\r\nthat caused by the inflammation it was meant to cure? How can he tell\r\nthe exhaustion produced by his evacuants from the collapse belonging to\r\nthe disease they were meant to remove?\r\n\r\nLastly, medication without insuring favorable hygienic conditions is\r\nlike amputation without ligatures. I had a chance to learn this well\r\nof old, when physician to the Broad Street district of the Boston\r\nDispensary. There, there was no help for the utter want of wholesome\r\nconditions, and if anybody got well under my care, it must have been\r\nin virtue of the rough-and-tumble constitution which emerges from the\r\nstruggle for life in the street gutters, rather than by the aid of my\r\nprescriptions.\r\n\r\nBut if the materia medica were lost overboard, how much more pains would\r\nbe taken in ordering all the circumstances surrounding the patient (as\r\ncan be done everywhere out of the crowded pauper districts), than are\r\ntaken now by too many who think they do their duty and earn their money\r\nwhen they write a recipe for a patient left in an atmosphere of domestic\r\nmalaria, or to the most negligent kind of nursing! I confess that I\r\nshould think my chance of recovery from illness less with Hippocrates\r\nfor my physician and Mrs. Gamp for my nurse, than if I were in the hands\r\nof Hahnemann himself, with Florence Nightingale or good Rebecca Taylor\r\nto care for me.\r\n\r\nIf I am right in maintaining that the presumption is always against\r\nthe use of noxious agents in disease, and if any whom I might influence\r\nshould adopt this as a principle of practice, they will often find\r\nthemselves embarrassed by the imperative demand of patients and their\r\nfriends for such agents where a case is not made out against this\r\nstanding presumption. I must be permitted to say, that I think the\r\nFrench, a not wholly uncivilized people, are in advance of the English\r\nand ourselves in the art of prescribing for the sick without hurting\r\nthem. And I do confess that I think their varied ptisans and syrups are\r\nas much preferable to the mineral regimen of bug-poison and ratsbane,\r\nso long in favor on the other side of the Channel, as their art of\r\npreparing food for the table to the rude cookery of those hard-feeding\r\nand much-dosing islanders. We want a reorganized cuisine of invalidism\r\nperhaps as much as the culinary, reform, for which our lyceum lecturers,\r\nand others who live much at hotels and taverns, are so urgent. Will you\r\nthink I am disrespectful if I ask whether, even in Massachusetts, a dose\r\nof calomel is not sometimes given by a physician on the same principle\r\nas that upon which a landlord occasionally prescribes bacon and\r\neggs,--because he cannot think of anything else quite so handy? I leave\r\nmy suggestion of borrowing a hint from French practice to your mature\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nI may, however, call your attention, briefly, to the singular fact,\r\nthat English and American practitioners are apt to accuse French medical\r\npractice of inertness, and French surgical practice of unnecessary\r\nactivity. Thus, Dr. Bostock considers French medical treatment, with\r\ncertain exceptions, as “decidedly less effective” than that of his own\r\ncountry. Mr. S. Cooper, again, defends the simple British practice of\r\nprocuring union by the first intention against the attacks of M. Roux\r\nand Baron Larrey. [Cooper's Surg. Diet. art. “Wounds.” Yet Mr. John\r\nBell gives the French surgeons credit for introducing this doctrine of\r\nadhesion, and accuses O'Halloran of “rudeness and ignorance,” and “bold,\r\nuncivil language,” in disputing their teaching. Princ. of Surgery, vol.\r\ni. p. 42. Mr. Hunter succeeded at last in naturalizing the doctrine and\r\npractice, but even he had to struggle against the perpetual jealousy\r\nof rivals, and died at length assassinated by an insult.] We have\r\noften heard similar opinions maintained by our own countrymen. While\r\nAnglo-American criticism blows hot or cold on the two departments of\r\nFrench practice, it is not, I hope, indecent to question whether all the\r\nwisdom is necessarily with us in both cases.\r\n\r\nOur art has had two or three lessons which have a deep meaning to those\r\nwho are willing to read them honestly. The use of water-dressings in\r\nsurgery completed the series of reforms by which was abolished the\r\n“coarse and cruel practice” of the older surgeons, who with their\r\ndressings and acrid balsams, their tents and leaden tubes, “absolutely\r\ndelayed the cure.” The doctrine of Broussais, transient as was its\r\nempire, reversed the practice of half of Christendom for a season, and\r\ntaught its hasty disciples to shun their old favorite remedies as mortal\r\npoisons. This was not enough permanently to shift the presumption about\r\ndrugs where it belonged, and so at last, just as the sympathetic powder\r\nand the Unguentum Armarium came in a superstitious age to kill out the\r\nabuses of external over-medication, the solemn farce of Homoeopathy was\r\nenacted in the face of our own too credulous civilization, that under\r\nshelter of its pretences the “inward bruises” of over-drugged viscera\r\nmight be allowed to heal by the first intention. Its lesson we must\r\naccept, whether we will or not; its follies we are tired of talking\r\nabout. The security of the medical profession against this and all\r\nsimilar fancies is in the average constitution of the human mind with\r\nregard to the laws of evidence.\r\n\r\nMy friends and brothers in Art! There is nothing to be feared from the\r\nutterance of any seeming heresy to which you may have listened. I cannot\r\ncompromise your collective wisdom. If I have strained the truth one\r\nhair's breadth for the sake of an epigram or an antithesis, you are\r\naccustomed to count the normal pulse-beats of sound judgment, and know\r\nfull well how to recognize the fever-throbs of conceit and the nervous\r\npalpitations of rhetoric.\r\n\r\nThe freedom with which each of us speaks his thought in this presence,\r\nbelongs in part to the assured position of the Profession in our\r\nCommonwealth, to the attitude of Science, which is always fearless, and\r\nto the genius of the soil on which we stand, from which Nature withheld\r\nthe fatal gift of malaria only to fill it with exhalations that breed\r\nthe fever of inquiry in our blood and in our brain. But mainly we owe\r\nthe large license of speech we enjoy to those influences and privileges\r\ncommon to us all as self-governing Americans.\r\n\r\nThis Republic is the chosen home of minorities, of the less power in\r\nthe presence of the greater. It is a common error to speak of our\r\ndistinction as consisting in the rule of the majority. Majorities, the\r\ngreater material powers, have always ruled before. The history of most\r\ncountries has been that of majorities, mounted majorities, clad in iron,\r\narmed with death treading down the tenfold more numerous minorities. In\r\nthe old civilizations they root themselves like oaks in the soil; men\r\nmust live in their shadow or cut them down. With us the majority is only\r\nthe flower of the passing noon, and the minority is the bud which may\r\nopen in the next morning's sun. We must be tolerant, for the thought\r\nwhich stammers on a single tongue today may organize itself in the\r\ngrowing consciousness of the time, and come back to us like the voice of\r\nthe multitudinous waves of the ocean on the morrow.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years have passed since one of your honored Presidents spoke\r\nto this Society of certain limitations to the power of our Art, now very\r\ngenerally conceded. Some were troubled, some were almost angry, thinking\r\nthe Profession might suffer from such concessions. It has certainly not\r\nsuffered here; if, as some affirm, it has lost respect anywhere, it was\r\nprobably for other, and no doubt sufficient reasons.\r\n\r\nSince that time the civilization of this planet has changed hands.\r\nStrike out of existence at this moment every person who was breathing on\r\nthat day, May 27, 1835, and every institution of society, every art and\r\nevery science would remain intact and complete in the living that would\r\nbe left. Every idea the world then held has been since dissolved and\r\nrecrystallized.\r\n\r\nWe are repeating the same process. Not to make silver shrines for our\r\nold divinities, even though by this craft we should have our wealth, was\r\nthis Society organized and carried on by the good men and true who went\r\nbefore us. Not for this, but to melt the gold out of the past, though\r\nits dross should fly in dust to all the winds of heaven, to save all our\r\nold treasures of knowledge and mine deeply for new, to cultivate that\r\nmutual respect of which outward courtesy is the sign, to work together,\r\nto feel together, to take counsel together, and to stand together\r\nfor the truth, now, always, here, everywhere; for this our fathers\r\ninstituted, and we accept, the offices and duties of this time-honored\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDER LINES OF KNOWLEDGE IN SOME PROVINCES OF MEDICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nAn Introductory Lecture delivered before the Medical Class of Harvard\r\nUniversity, November 6, 1861.\r\n\r\n[This Lecture appears as it would have been delivered had the time\r\nallowed been less strictly, limited. Passages necessarily omitted\r\nhave been restored, and points briefly touched have been more fully\r\nconsidered. A few notes have been added for the benefit of that limited\r\nclass of students who care to track an author through the highways and\r\nby-ways of his reading. I owe my thanks to several of my professional\r\nbrethren who have communicated with me on subjects with which they are\r\nfamiliar; especially to Dr. John Dean, for the opportunity of profiting\r\nby his unpublished labors, and to Dr. Hasket Derby, for information and\r\nreferences to recent authorities relating to the anatomy and physiology\r\nof the eye.]\r\n\r\nThe entrance upon a new course of Lectures is always a period of\r\ninterest to instructors and pupils. As the birth of a child to a parent,\r\nso is the advent of a new class to a teacher. As the light of the\r\nuntried world to the infant, so is the dawning of the light resting\r\nover the unexplored realms of science to the student. In the name of the\r\nFaculty I welcome you, Gentlemen of the Medical Class, new-born babes of\r\nscience, or lustier nurslings, to this morning of your medical life, and\r\nto the arms and the bosom of this ancient University. Fourteen years ago\r\nI stood in this place for the first time to address those who occupied\r\nthese benches. As I recall these past seasons of our joint labors, I\r\nfeel that they have been on the whole prosperous, and not undeserving of\r\ntheir prosperity.\r\n\r\nFor it has been my privilege to be associated with a body of true and\r\nfaithful workers; I cannot praise them freely to their faces, or I\r\nshould be proud to discourse of the harmonious diligence and the noble\r\nspirit in which they have toiled together, not merely to teach their\r\nseveral branches, but to elevate the whole standard of teaching.\r\n\r\nI may speak with less restraint of those gentlemen who have aided me in\r\nthe most laborious part of my daily duties, the Demonstrators, to whom\r\nthe successive classes have owed so much of their instruction. They rise\r\nbefore me, the dead and the living, in the midst of the most grateful\r\nrecollections. The fair, manly face and stately figure of my friend,\r\nDr. Samuel Parkman, himself fit for the highest offices of teaching, yet\r\nwilling to be my faithful assistant in the time of need, come back to\r\nme with the long sigh of regret for his early loss to our earthly\r\ncompanionship. Every year I speak the eulogy of Dr. Ainsworth's patient\r\ntoil as I show his elaborate preparations: When I take down my “American\r\nCyclopaedia” and borrow instruction from the learned articles of Dr.\r\nKneeland, I cease to regret that his indefatigable and intelligent\r\nindustry was turned into a broader channel. And what can I say too\r\ncordial of my long associated companion and friend, Dr. Hodges, whose\r\nadmirable skill, working through the swiftest and surest fingers that\r\never held a scalpel among us, has delighted class after class, and\r\nfilled our Museum with monuments which will convey his name to unborn\r\ngenerations?\r\n\r\nThis day belongs, however, not to myself and my recollections, but to\r\nall of us who teach and all of you who listen, whether experts in\r\nour specialties or aliens to their mysteries, or timid neophytes just\r\nentering the portals of the hall of science. Look in with me, then,\r\nwhile I attempt to throw some rays into its interior, which shall\r\nilluminate a few of its pillars and cornices, and show at the same time\r\nhow many niches and alcoves remain in darkness.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE is the topography of ignorance. From a few elevated points we\r\ntriangulate vast spaces, inclosing infinite unknown details. We cast the\r\nlead, and draw up a little sand from abysses we may never reach with our\r\ndredges.\r\n\r\nThe best part of our knowledge is that which teaches us where knowledge\r\nleaves off and ignorance begins. Nothing more clearly separates a vulgar\r\nfrom a superior mind, than the confusion in the first between the little\r\nthat it truly knows, on the one hand, and what it half knows and what it\r\nthinks it knows on the other.\r\n\r\nThat which is true of every subject is especially true of the branch of\r\nknowledge which deals with living beings. Their existence is a perpetual\r\ndeath and reanimation. Their identity is only an idea, for we put off\r\nour bodies many times during our lives, and dress in new suits of bones\r\nand muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n        “Thou art not thyself;\r\n   For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains\r\n   That issue out of dust.”\r\n\r\nIf it is true that we understand ourselves but imperfectly in health,\r\nthis truth is more signally manifested in disease, where natural actions\r\nimperfectly understood, disturbed in an obscure way by half-seen causes,\r\nare creeping and winding along in the dark toward their destined issue,\r\nsometimes using our remedies as safe stepping-stones, occasionally, it\r\nmay be, stumbling over them as obstacles.\r\n\r\nI propose in this lecture to show you some points of contact between our\r\nignorance and our knowledge in several of the branches upon the study\r\nof which you are entering. I may teach you a very little directly, but I\r\nhope much more from the trains of thought I shall suggest. Do not expect\r\ntoo much ground to be covered in this rapid survey. Our task is only\r\nthat of sending out a few pickets under the starry flag of science to\r\nthe edge of that dark domain where the ensigns of the obstinate rebel,\r\nIgnorance, are flying undisputed. We are not making a reconnoissance\r\nin force, still less advancing with the main column. But here are a few\r\nroads along which we have to march together, and we wish to see clearly\r\nhow far our lines extend, and where the enemy's outposts begin.\r\n\r\nBefore touching the branches of knowledge that deal with organization\r\nand vital functions, let us glance at that science which meets you at\r\nthe threshold of your study, and prepares you in some measure to deal\r\nwith the more complex problems of the living laboratory.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY includes the art of separating and combining the elements of\r\nmatter, and the study of the changes produced by these operations. We\r\ncan hardly say too much of what it has contributed to our knowledge of\r\nthe universe and our power of dealing with its materials. It has given\r\nus a catalogue raisonne of the substances found upon our planet, and\r\nshown how everything living and dead is put together from them. It is\r\naccomplishing wonders before us every day, such as Arabian story-tellers\r\nused to string together in their fables. It spreads the sensitive film\r\non the artificial retina which looks upon us through the optician's lens\r\nfor a few seconds, and fixes an image that will outlive its original.\r\nIt questions the light of the sun, and detects the vaporized metals\r\nfloating around the great luminary,--iron, sodium, lithium, and\r\nthe rest,--as if the chemist of our remote planet could fill his\r\nbell-glasses from its fiery atmosphere. It lends the power which flashes\r\nour messages in thrills that leave the lazy chariot of day behind them.\r\nIt seals up a few dark grains in iron vases, and lo! at the touch of a\r\nsingle spark, rises in smoke and flame a mighty Afrit with a voice\r\nlike thunder and an arm that shatters like an earthquake. The dreams of\r\nOriental fancy have become the sober facts of our every-day life, and\r\nthe chemist is the magician to whom we owe them.\r\n\r\nTo return to the colder scientific aspect of chemistry. It has shown\r\nus how bodies stand affected to each other through an almost boundless\r\nrange of combinations. It has given us a most ingenious theory to\r\naccount for certain fixed relations in these combinations. It has\r\nsuccessfully eliminated a great number of proximate compounds, more or\r\nless stable, from organic structures. It has invented others which form\r\nthe basis of long series of well-known composite substances. In fact, we\r\nare perhaps becoming overburdened with our list of proximate principles,\r\ndemonstrated and hypothetical.\r\n\r\nHow much nearer have we come to the secret of force than Lully and Geber\r\nand the whole crew of juggling alchemists? We have learned a great deal\r\nabout the how, what have we learned about the why?\r\n\r\nWhy does iron rust, while gold remains untarnished, and gold amalgamate,\r\nwhile iron refuses the alliance of mercury?\r\n\r\nThe alchemists called gold Sol, the sun, and iron Mars, and pleased\r\nthemselves with fancied relations between these substances and the\r\nheavenly bodies, by which they pretended to explain the facts they\r\nobserved. Some of their superstitions have lingered in practical\r\nmedicine to the present day, but chemistry has grown wise enough to\r\nconfess the fact of absolute ignorance.\r\n\r\nWhat is it that makes common salt crystallize in the form of cubes,\r\nand saltpetre in the shape of six-sided prisms? We see no reason why it\r\nshould not have been just the other way, salt in prisms and saltpetre in\r\ncubes, or why either should take an exact geometrical outline, any more\r\nthan coagulating albumen.\r\n\r\nBut although we had given up attempting to explain the essential nature\r\nof affinities and of crystalline types, we might have supposed that we\r\nhad at least fixed the identity of the substances with which we deal,\r\nand determined the laws of their combination. All at once we find that a\r\nsimple substance changes face, puts off its characteristic qualities and\r\nresumes them at will;--not merely when we liquefy or vaporize a solid,\r\nor reverse the process; but that a solid is literally transformed into\r\nanother solid under our own eyes. We thought we knew phosphorus. We warm\r\na portion of it sealed in an empty tube, for about a week. It has\r\nbecome a brown infusible substance, which does not shine in the dark\r\nnor oxidate in the air. We heat it to 500 F., and it becomes common\r\nphosphorus again. We transmute sulphur in the same singular way. Nature,\r\nyou know, gives us carbon in the shape of coal and in that of the\r\ndiamond. It is easy to call these changes by the name allotropism, but\r\nnot the less do they confound our hasty generalizations.\r\n\r\nThese facts of allotropism have some corollaries connected with them\r\nrather startling to us of the nineteenth century. There may be other\r\ntransmutations possible besides those of phosphorus and sulphur. When\r\nDr. Prout, in 1840, talked about azote and carbon being “formed” in the\r\nliving system, it was looked upon as one of those freaks of fancy to\r\nwhich philosophers, like other men, are subject. But when Professor\r\nFaraday, in 1851, says, at a meeting of the British Association, that\r\n“his hopes are in the direction of proving that bodies called simple\r\nwere really compounds, and may be formed artificially as soon as we\r\nare masters of the laws influencing their combinations,”--when he comes\r\nforward and says that he has tried experiments at transmutation,\r\nand means, if his life is spared, to try them again,--how can we\r\nbe surprised at the popular story of 1861, that Louis Napoleon has\r\nestablished a gold-factory and is glutting the mints of Europe with\r\nbullion of his own making?\r\n\r\nAnd so with reference to the law of combinations. The old maxim was,\r\nCorpora non agunt nisi soluta. If two substances, a and b, are inclosed\r\nin a glass vessel, c, we do not expect the glass to change them, unless\r\na or b or the compound a b has the power of dissolving the glass. But\r\nif for a I take oxygen, for b hydrogen, and for c a piece of spongy\r\nplatinum, I find the first two combine with the common signs of\r\ncombustion and form water, the third in the mean time undergoing no\r\nperceptible change. It has played the part of the unwedded priest, who\r\nmarries a pair without taking a fee or having any further relation with\r\nthe parties. We call this catalysis, catalytic action, the action of\r\npresence, or by what learned name we choose. Give what name to it we\r\nwill, it is a manifestation of power which crosses our established laws\r\nof combination at a very open angle of intersection. I think we may\r\nfind an analogy for it in electrical induction, the disturbance of the\r\nequilibrium of the electricity of a body by the approach of a charged\r\nbody to it, without interchange of electrical conditions between the\r\ntwo bodies. But an analogy is not an explanation, and why a few drops\r\nof yeast should change a saccharine mixture to carbonic acid and\r\nalcohol,--a little leaven leavening the whole lump,--not by combining\r\nwith it, but by setting a movement at work, we not only cannot explain,\r\nbut the fact is such an exception to the recognized laws of combination\r\nthat Liebig is unwilling to admit the new force at all to which\r\nBerzelius had given the name so generally accepted.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of isomerism, or identity of composition and proportions\r\nof constituents with difference of qualities, and of isomorphism, or\r\nidentity of form in crystals which have one element substituted for\r\nanother, were equally surprises to science; and although the mechanism\r\nby which they are brought about can be to a certain extent explained\r\nby a reference to the hypothetical atoms of which the elements are\r\nconstituted, yet this is only turning the difficulty into a fraction\r\nwith an infinitesimal denominator and an infinite numerator.\r\n\r\nSo far we have studied the working of force and its seeming anomalies\r\nin purely chemical phenomena. But we soon find that chemical force is\r\ndeveloped by various other physical agencies,--by heat, by light, by\r\nelectricity, by magnetism, by mechanical agencies; and, vice versa, that\r\nchemical action develops heat, light, electricity, magnetism, mechanical\r\nforce, as we see in our matches, galvanic batteries, and explosive\r\ncompounds. Proceeding with our experiments, we find that every kind\r\nof force is capable of producing all other kinds, or, in Mr. Faraday's\r\nlanguage, that “the various forms under which the forces of matter are\r\nmade manifest have a common origin, or, in other words, are so directly\r\nrelated and mutually dependent that they are convertible one into\r\nanother.”\r\n\r\nOut of this doctrine naturally springs that of the conservation of\r\nforce, so ably illustrated by Mr. Grove, Dr. Carpenter, and Mr. Faraday.\r\nThis idea is no novelty, though it seems so at first sight. It was\r\nmaintained and disputed among the giants of philosophy. Des Cartes and\r\nLeibnitz denied that any new motion originated in nature, or that any\r\never ceased to exist; all motion being in a circle, passing from one\r\nbody to another, one losing what the other gained. Newton, on the\r\nother hand, believed that new motions were generated and existing ones\r\ndestroyed. On the first supposition, there is a fixed amount of force\r\nalways circulating in the universe. On the second, the total amount may\r\nbe increasing or diminishing. You will find in the “Annual of Scientific\r\nDiscovery” for 1858 a very interesting lecture by Professor Helmholtz of\r\nBonn, in which it is maintained that a certain portion of force is lost\r\nin every natural process, being converted into unchangeable heat, so\r\nthat the universe will come to a stand-still at last, all force passing\r\ninto heat, and all heat into a state of equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of the convertibility or specific equivalence of the\r\nvarious forms of force, and of its conservation, which is its logical\r\nconsequence, are very generally accepted, as I believe, at the present\r\ntime, among physicists. We are naturally led to the question, What is\r\nthe nature of force? The three illustrious philosophers just referred\r\nto agree in attributing the general movements of the universe to the\r\nimmediate Divine action. The doctrine of “preestablished harmony” was\r\nan especial contrivance of Leibnitz to remove the Creator from unworthy\r\nassociation with the less divine acts of living beings. Obsolete as this\r\nexpression sounds to our ears, the phrase laws of the universe, which\r\nwe use so constantly with a wider application, appears to me essentially\r\nidentical with it.\r\n\r\nForce does not admit of explanation, nor of proper definition, any more\r\nthan the hypothetical substratum of matter. If we assume the Infinite as\r\nomnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, we cannot suppose Him excluded from\r\nany part of His creation, except from rebellious souls which voluntarily\r\nexclude Him by the exercise of their fatal prerogative of free-will.\r\nForce, then, is the act of immanent Divinity. I find no meaning in\r\nmechanical explanations. Newton's hypothesis of an ether filling the\r\nheavenly spaces does not, I confess, help my conceptions. I will, and\r\nthe muscles of my vocal organs shape my speech. God wills, and the\r\nuniverse articulates His power, wisdom, and goodness. That is all I\r\nknow. There is no bridge my mind can throw from the “immaterial” cause\r\nto the “material” effect.\r\n\r\nThe problem of force meets us everywhere, and I prefer to encounter\r\nit in the world of physical phenomena before reaching that of living\r\nactions. It is only the name for the incomprehensible cause of certain\r\nchanges known to our consciousness, and assumed to be outside of it. For\r\nme it is the Deity Himself in action.\r\n\r\nI can therefore see a large significance in the somewhat bold language\r\nof Burdach: “There is for me but one miracle, that of infinite\r\nexistence, and but one mystery, the manner in which the finite proceeds\r\nfrom the infinite. So soon as we recognize this incomprehensible act as\r\nthe general and primordial miracle, of which our reason perceives the\r\nnecessity, but the manner of which our intelligence cannot grasp, so\r\nsoon as we contemplate the nature known to us by experience in this\r\nlight, there is for us no other impenetrable miracle or mystery.”\r\n\r\nLet us turn to a branch of knowledge which deals with certainties up to\r\nthe limit of the senses, and is involved in no speculations beyond them.\r\nIn certain points of view, HUMAN ANATOMY may be considered an almost\r\nexhausted science. From time to time some small organ which had escaped\r\nearlier observers has been pointed out,--such parts as the tensor\r\ntarsi, the otic ganglion, or the Pacinian bodies; but some of our best\r\nanatomical works are those which have been classic for many generations.\r\nThe plates of the bones in Vesalius, three centuries old, are still\r\nmasterpieces of accuracy, as of art. The magnificent work of Albinus on\r\nthe muscles, published in 1747, is still supreme in its department,\r\nas the constant references of the most thorough recent treatise on\r\nthe subject, that of Theile, sufficiently show. More has been done in\r\nunravelling the mysteries of the fasciae, but there has been a tendency\r\nto overdo this kind of material analysis. Alexander Thomson split them\r\nup into cobwebs, as you may see in the plates to Velpeau's Surgical\r\nAnatomy. I well remember how he used to shake his head over the coarse\r\nwork of Scarpa and Astley Cooper,--as if Denner, who painted the\r\nseparate hairs of the beard and pores of the skin in his portraits, had\r\nspoken lightly of the pictures of Rubens and Vandyk.\r\n\r\nNot only has little been added to the catalogue of parts, but some\r\nthings long known had become half-forgotten. Louis and others confounded\r\nthe solitary glands of the lower part of the small intestine with those\r\nwhich “the great Brunner,” as Haller calls him, described in 1687 as\r\nbeing found in the duodenum. The display of the fibrous structure of the\r\nbrain seemed a novelty as shown by Spurzheim. One is startled to find\r\nthe method anticipated by Raymond Vieussens nearly two centuries ago. I\r\ncan hardly think Gordon had ever looked at his figures, though he names\r\ntheir author, when he wrote the captious and sneering article which\r\nattracted so much attention in the pages of the “Edinburgh Review.”\r\n\r\nThis is the place, if anywhere, to mention any observations I could\r\npretend to have made in the course of my teaching the structure of the\r\nhuman body. I can make no better show than most of my predecessors in\r\nthis well-reaped field. The nucleated cells found connected with the\r\ncancellated structure of the bones, which I first pointed out and had\r\nfigured in 1847, and have shown yearly from that time to the present,\r\nand the fossa masseterica, a shallow concavity on the ramus of the\r\nlower jaw, for the lodgment of the masseter muscle, which acquires\r\nsignificance when examined by the side of the deep cavity on the\r\ncorresponding part in some carnivora to which it answers, may perhaps be\r\nclaimed as deserving attention. I have also pleased myself by making a\r\nspecial group of the six radiating muscles which diverge from the spine\r\nof the axis, or second cervical vertebra, and by giving to it the name\r\nstella musculosa nuchae. But this scanty catalogue is only an evidence\r\nthat one may teach long and see little that has not been noted by those\r\nwho have gone before him. Of course I do not think it necessary to\r\ninclude rare, but already described anomalies, such as the episternal\r\nbones, the rectus sternalis, and other interesting exceptional\r\nformations I have encountered, which have shown a curious tendency to\r\npresent themselves several times in the same season, perhaps because the\r\nfirst specimen found calls our attention to any we may subsequently meet\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe anatomy of the scalpel and the amphitheatre was, then, becoming an\r\nexhausted branch of investigation. But during the present century the\r\nstudy of the human body has changed its old aspect, and become fertile\r\nin new observations. This rejuvenescence was effected by means of two\r\nprincipal agencies,--new methods and a new instrument.\r\n\r\nDescriptive anatomy, as known from an early date, is to the body what\r\ngeography is to the planet. Now geography was pretty well known so long\r\nago as when Arrowsmith, who was born in 1750, published his admirable\r\nmaps. But in that same year was born Werner, who taught a new way of\r\nstudying the earth, since become familiar to us all under the name of\r\nGeology.\r\n\r\nWhat geology has done for our knowledge of the earth, has been done for\r\nour knowledge of the body by that method of study to which is given the\r\nname of General Anatomy. It studies, not the organs as such, but the\r\nelements out of which the organs are constructed. It is the geology of\r\nthe body, as that is the general anatomy of the earth. The extraordinary\r\ngenius of Bichat, to whom more than any other we owe this new method\r\nof study, does not require Mr. Buckle's testimony to impress the\r\npractitioner with the importance of its achievements. I have heard a\r\nvery wise physician question whether any important result had accrued\r\nto practical medicine from Harvey's discovery of the circulation. But\r\nAnatomy, Physiology, and Pathology have received a new light from this\r\nnovel method of contemplating the living structures, which has had a\r\nvast influence in enabling the practitioner at least to distinguish\r\nand predict the course of disease. We know as well what differences\r\nto expect in the habits of a mucous and of a serous membrane, as what\r\nmineral substances to look for in the chalk or the coal measures. You\r\nhave only to read Cullen's description of inflammation of the lungs or\r\nof the bowels, and compare it with such as you may find in Laennec\r\nor Watson, to see the immense gain which diagnosis and prognosis have\r\nderived from general anatomy.\r\n\r\nThe second new method of studying the human structure, beginning with\r\nthe labors of Scarpa, Burns, and Colles, grew up principally during the\r\nfirst third of this century. It does not deal with organs, as did the\r\nearlier anatomists, nor with tissues, after the manner of Bichat. It\r\nmaps the whole surface of the body into an arbitrary number of regions,\r\nand studies each region successively from the surface to the bone, or\r\nbeneath it. This hardly deserves the name of a science, although\r\nVelpeau has dignified it with that title, but it furnishes an admirable\r\npractical way for the surgeon who has to operate on a particular region\r\nof the body to study that region. If we are buying a farm, we are not\r\ncontent with the State map or a geological chart including the estate in\r\nquestion. We demand an exact survey of that particular property, so that\r\nwe may know what we are dealing with. This is just what regional, or,\r\nas it is sometimes called, surgical anatomy, does for the surgeon with\r\nreference to the part on which his skill is to be exercised. It enables\r\nhim to see with the mind's eye through the opaque tissues down to the\r\nbone on which they lie, as if the skin were transparent as the cornea,\r\nand the organs it covers translucent as the gelatinous pulp of a medusa.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that the Japanese should have anticipated Europe in a kind\r\nof rude regional anatomy. I have seen a manikin of Japanese make traced\r\nall over with lines, and points marking their intersection. By this\r\ntheir doctors are guided in the performance of acupuncture, marking the\r\nsafe places to thrust in needles, as we buoy out our ship-channels, and\r\ndoubtless indicating to learned eyes the spots where incautious meddling\r\nhad led to those little accidents of shipwreck to which patients are\r\nunfortunately liable.\r\n\r\nA change of method, then, has given us General and Regional Anatomy.\r\nThese, too, have been worked so thoroughly, that, if not exhausted, they\r\nhave at least become to a great extent fixed and positive branches of\r\nknowledge. But the first of them, General Anatomy, would never have\r\nreached this positive condition but for the introduction of that\r\ninstrument which I have mentioned as the second great aid to modern\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThis instrument is the achromatic microscope. For the history of the\r\nsuccessive steps by which it became the effective scientific implement\r\nwe now possess, I must refer you to the work of Mr. Quekett, to an\r\nexcellent article in the “Penny Cyclopaedia,” or to that of Sir David\r\nBrewster in the “Encyclopaedia Britannica.” It is a most interesting\r\npiece of scientific history, which shows how the problem which Biot in\r\n1821 pronounced insolvable was in the course of a few years practically\r\nsolved, with a success equal to that which Dollond had long before\r\nobtained with the telescope. It is enough for our purpose that we\r\nare now in possession of an instrument freed from all confusions and\r\nillusions, which magnifies a thousand diameters,--a million times in\r\nsurface,--without serious distortion or discoloration of its object.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century ago, or a little more, an instructor would not\r\nhave hesitated to put John Bell's “Anatomy” and Bostock's “Physiology”\r\n into a student's hands, as good authority on their respective subjects.\r\nLet us not be unjust to either of these authors. John Bell is the\r\nliveliest medical writer that I can remember who has written since the\r\ndays of delightful old Ambroise Pare. His picturesque descriptions and\r\nbold figures are as good now as they ever were, and his book can never\r\nbecome obsolete. But listen to what John Bell says of the microscope:\r\n\r\n“Philosophers of the last age had been at infinite pains to find the\r\nultimate fibre of muscles, thinking to discover its properties in its\r\nform; but they saw just in proportion to the glasses which they used, or\r\nto their practice and skill in that art, which is now almost forsaken.”\r\n\r\nDr. Bostock's work, neglected as it is, is one which I value very highly\r\nas a really learned compilation, full of original references. But\r\nDr. Bostock says: “Much as the naturalist has been indebted to the\r\nmicroscope, by bringing into view many beings of which he could not\r\notherwise have ascertained the existence, the physiologist has not yet\r\nderived any great benefit from the instrument.”\r\n\r\nThese are only specimens of the manner in which the microscope and its\r\nresults were generally regarded by the generation just preceding our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nI have referred you to the proper authorities for the account of those\r\nimprovements which about the year 1830 rendered the compound microscope\r\nan efficient and trustworthy instrument. It was now for the first time\r\nthat a true general anatomy became possible. As early as 1816 Treviranus\r\nhad attempted to resolve the tissues, of which Bichat had admitted no\r\nless than twenty-one, into their simple microscopic elements. How\r\ncould such an attempt succeed, Henle well asks, at a time when the most\r\nextensively diffused of all the tissues, the areolar, was not at all\r\nunderstood? All that method could do had been accomplished by Bichat and\r\nhis followers. It was for the optician to take the next step. The future\r\nof anatomy and physiology, as an enthusiastic micrologist of the time\r\nsaid, was in the hands of Messrs. Schieck and Pistor, famous opticians\r\nof Berlin.\r\n\r\nIn those earlier days of which I am speaking, all the points of minute\r\nanatomy were involved in obscurity. Some found globules everywhere,\r\nsome fibres. Students disputed whether the conjunctiva extended over\r\nthe cornea or not, and worried themselves over Gaultier de Claubry's\r\nstratified layers of the skin, or Breschet's blennogenous and\r\nchromatogenous organs. The dartos was a puzzle, the central spinal canal\r\na myth, the decidua clothed in fable as much as the golden fleece. The\r\nstructure of bone, now so beautifully made out,--even that of the teeth,\r\nin which old Leeuwenhoek, peeping with his octogenarian eyes through the\r\nminute lenses wrought with his own hands, had long ago seen the “pipes,”\r\n as he called them,--was hardly known at all. The minute structure of\r\nthe viscera lay in the mists of an uncertain microscopic vision. The\r\nintimate recesses of the animal system were to the students of anatomy\r\nwhat the anterior of Africa long was to geographers, and the stories of\r\nmicroscopic explorers were as much sneered at as those of Bruce or Du\r\nChailly, and with better reason.\r\n\r\nNow what have we come to in our own day? In the first place, the minute\r\nstructure of all the organs has been made out in the most satisfactory\r\nway. The special arrangements of the vessels and the ducts of all the\r\nglands, of the air-tubes and vesicles of the lungs, of the parts which\r\nmake up the skin and other membranes, all the details of those complex\r\nparenchymatous organs which had confounded investigation so long, have\r\nbeen lifted out of the invisible into the sight of all observers. It\r\nis fair to mention here, that we owe a great deal to the art of minute\r\ninjection, by which we are enabled to trace the smallest vessels in the\r\nmidst of the tissues where they are distributed. This is an old artifice\r\nof anatomists. The famous Ruysch, who died a hundred and thirty years\r\nago, showed that each of the viscera has its terminal vessels arranged\r\nin its own peculiar way; the same fact which you may see illustrated in\r\nGerber's figures after the minute injections of Berres. I hope to show\r\nyou many specimens of this kind in the microscope, the work of English\r\nand American hands. Professor Agassiz allows me also to make use of\r\na very rich collection of injected preparations sent him by Professor\r\nHyrtl, formerly of Prague, now of Vienna, for the proper exhibition\r\nof which I had a number of microscopes made expressly, by Mr. Grunow,\r\nduring the past season. All this illustrates what has been done for the\r\nelucidation of the intimate details of formation of the organs.\r\n\r\nBut the great triumph of the microscope as applied to anatomy has\r\nbeen in the resolution of the organs and the tissues into their simple\r\nconstituent anatomical elements. It has taken up general anatomy where\r\nBichat left it. He had succeeded in reducing the structural language of\r\nnature to syllables, if you will permit me to use so bold an image. The\r\nmicroscopic observers who have come after him have analyzed these into\r\nletters, as we may call them,--the simple elements by the combination of\r\nwhich Nature spells out successively tissues, which are her syllables,\r\norgans which are her words, systems which are her chapters, and so goes\r\non from the simple to the complex, until she binds up in one living\r\nwhole that wondrous volume of power and wisdom which we call the human\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe alphabet of the organization is so short and simple, that I will\r\nrisk fatiguing your attention by repeating it, according to the plan I\r\nhave long adopted.\r\n\r\nA. Cells, either floating, as in the blood, or fixed, like those in the\r\ncancellated structure of bone, already referred to. Very commonly they\r\nhave undergone a change of figure, most frequently a flattening which\r\nreduces them to scales, as in the epidermis and the epithelium.\r\n\r\nB. Simple, translucent, homogeneous solid, such as is found at the back\r\nof the cornea, or forming the intercellular substance of cartilage.\r\n\r\nC. The white fibrous element, consisting of very delicate, tenacious\r\nthreads. This is the long staple textile substance of the body. It is to\r\nthe organism what cotton is pretended to be to our Southern States.\r\nIt pervades the whole animal fabric as areolar tissue, which is the\r\nuniversal packing and wrapping material. It forms the ligaments which\r\nbind the whole frame-work together. It furnishes the sinews, which are\r\nthe channels of power. It enfolds every muscle. It wraps the brain in\r\nits hard, insensible folds, and the heart itself beats in a purse that\r\nis made of it.\r\n\r\nD. The yellow elastic, fibrous element, the caoutchouc of the animal\r\nmechanism, which pulls things back into place, as the India-rubber band\r\nshuts the door we have opened.\r\n\r\nE. The striped muscular fibre,--the red flesh, which shortens itself in\r\nobedience to the will, and thus produces all voluntary active motion.\r\n\r\nF. The unstriped muscular fibre, more properly the fusiform-cell fibre,\r\nwhich carries on the involuntary internal movements.\r\n\r\nG. The nerve-cylinder, a glassy tube, with a pith of some firmness,\r\nwhich conveys sensation to the brain and the principle which induces\r\nmotion from it.\r\n\r\nH. The nerve-corpuscle, the centre of nervous power.\r\n\r\nI. The mucous tissue, as Virchow calls it, common in embryonic\r\nstructures, seen in the vitreous humor of the adult.\r\n\r\nTo these add X, granules, of indeterminate shape and size, Y, for\r\ninorganic matters, such as the salts of bone and teeth, and Z, to stand\r\nas a symbol of the fluids, and you have the letters of what I have\r\nventured to call the alphabet of the body.\r\n\r\nBut just as in language certain diphthongs and syllables are frequently\r\nrecurring, so we have in the body certain secondary and tertiary\r\ncombinations, which we meet more frequently than the solitary elements\r\nof which they are composed.\r\n\r\nThus A B, or a collection of cells united by simple structureless\r\nsolid, is seen to be extensively employed in the body under the name of\r\ncartilage. Out of this the surfaces of the articulations and the springs\r\nof the breathing apparatus are formed. But when Nature came to the\r\nbuffers of the spinal column (intervertebral disks) and the washers of\r\nthe joints (semilunar fibrocartilages of the knee, etc.), she required\r\nmore tenacity than common cartilage possessed. What did she do? What\r\ndoes man do in a similar case of need? I need hardly tell you. The mason\r\nlays his bricks in simple mortar. But the plasterer works some hair into\r\nthe mortar which he is going to lay in large sheets on the walls. The\r\nchildren of Israel complained that they had no straw to make their\r\nbricks with, though portions of it may still be seen in the crumbling\r\npyramid of Darshour, which they are said to have built. I visited the\r\nold house on Witch Hill in Salem a year or two ago, and there I found\r\nthe walls coated with clay in which straw was abundantly mingled;--the\r\nold Judaizing witch-hangers copied the Israelites in a good many things.\r\nThe Chinese and the Corsicans blend the fibres of amianthus in their\r\npottery to give it tenacity. Now to return to Nature. To make her\r\nbuffers and washers hold together in the shocks to which they would\r\nbe subjected, she took common cartilage and mingled the white fibrous\r\ntissue with it, to serve the same purpose as the hair in the mortar,\r\nthe straw in the bricks and in the plaster of the old wall, and the\r\namianthus in the earthen vessels. Thus we have the combination A B C, or\r\nfibro-cartilage. Again, the bones were once only gristle or cartilage,\r\nA B. To give them solidity they were infiltrated with stone, in the form\r\nof salts of lime, an inorganic element, so that bone would be spelt out\r\nby the letters A, B, and Y.\r\n\r\nIf from these organic syllables we proceed to form organic words, we\r\nshall find that Nature employs three principal forms; namely, Vessels,\r\nMembranes, and Parenchyma, or visceral tissue. The most complex of\r\nthem can be resolved into a combination of these few simple anatomical\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nPassing for a moment into the domain of PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY, we find\r\nthe same elements in morbid growths that we have met with in normal\r\nstructures. The pus-corpuscle and the white blood-corpuscle can only\r\nbe distinguished by tracing them to their origin. A frequent form of\r\nso-called malignant disease proves to be only a collection of altered\r\nepithelium-cells. Even cancer itself has no specific anatomical element,\r\nand the diagnosis of a cancerous tumor by the microscope, though\r\ntolerably sure under the eye of an expert, is based upon accidental, and\r\nnot essential points,--the crowding together of the elements, the size\r\nof the cell-nuclei, and similar variable characters.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to PHYSIOLOGY. The microscope, which has made a new science\r\nof the intimate structure of the organs, has at the same time cleared up\r\nmany uncertainties concerning the mechanism of the special functions. Up\r\nto the time of the living generation of observers, Nature had kept over\r\nall her inner workshops the forbidding inscription, No Admittance! If\r\nany prying observer ventured to spy through his magnifying tubes into\r\nthe mysteries of her glands and canals and fluids, she covered up her\r\nwork in blinding mists and bewildering halos, as the deities of old\r\nconcealed their favored heroes in the moment of danger.\r\n\r\nScience has at length sifted the turbid light of her lenses, and\r\nblanched their delusive rainbows.\r\n\r\nAnatomy studies the organism in space. Physiology studies it also in\r\ntime. After the study of form and composition follows close that of\r\naction, and this leads us along back to the first moment of the germ,\r\nand forward to the resolution of the living frame into its lifeless\r\nelements. In this way Anatomy, or rather that branch of it which we call\r\nHistology, has become inseparably blended with the study of function.\r\nThe connection between the science of life and that of intimate\r\nstructure on the one hand, and composition on the other, is illustrated\r\nin the titles of two recent works of remarkable excellence,--“the\r\nPhysiological Anatomy” of Todd and Bowman, and the “Physiological\r\nChemistry” of Lehmann.\r\n\r\nLet me briefly recapitulate a few of our acquisitions in Physiology, due\r\nin large measure to our new instruments and methods of research, and\r\nat the same time indicate the limits which form the permanent or the\r\ntemporary boundaries of our knowledge. I will begin with the largest\r\nfact and with the most absolute and universally encountered limitation.\r\n\r\nThe “largest truth in Physiology” Mr. Paget considers to be “the\r\ndevelopment of ova through multiplication and division of their cells.”\r\n I would state it more broadly as the agency of the cell in all living\r\nprocesses. It seems at present necessary to abandon the original idea of\r\nSchwann, that we can observe the building up of a cell from the simple\r\ngranules of a blastema, or formative fluid. The evidence points rather\r\ntowards the axiom, Omnis cellula a cellula; that is, the germ of a new\r\ncell is always derived from a preexisting cell. The doctrine of Schwann,\r\nas I remarked long ago (1844), runs parallel with the nebular theory in\r\nastronomy, and they may yet stand or fall together.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen Nature anticipating the plasterer in fibro-cartilage,\r\nso we see her beforehand with the glassblower in her dealings with the\r\ncell. The artisan blows his vitreous bubbles, large or small, to be used\r\nafterwards as may be wanted. So Nature shapes her hyaline vesicles and\r\nmodifies them to serve the needs of the part where they are found. The\r\nartisan whirls his rod, and his glass bubble becomes a flattened disk,\r\nwith its bull's-eye for a nucleus. These lips of ours are all glazed\r\nwith microscopic tiles formed of flattened cells, each one of them with\r\nits nucleus still as plain and relatively as prominent, to the eye of\r\nthe microscopist, as the bull's-eye in the old-fashioned windowpane.\r\nEverywhere we find cells, modified or unchanged. They roll in\r\ninconceivable multitudes (five millions and more to the cubic\r\nmillimetre, according to Vierordt) as blood-disks through our vessels.\r\nA close-fitting mail of flattened cells coats our surface with a panoply\r\nof imbricated scales (more than twelve thousand millions), as Harting\r\nhas computed, as true a defence against our enemies as the buckler of\r\nthe armadillo or the carapace of the tortoise against theirs. The same\r\nlittle protecting organs pave all the great highways of the interior\r\nsystem. Cells, again, preside over the chemical processes which\r\nelaborate the living fluids; they change their form to become the agents\r\nof voluntary and involuntary motion; the soul itself sits on a throne\r\nof nucleated cells, and flashes its mandates through skeins of glassy\r\nfilaments which once were simple chains of vesicles. And, as if to\r\nreduce the problem of living force to its simplest expression, we see\r\nthe yolk of a transparent egg dividing itself in whole or in part, and\r\nagain dividing and subdividing, until it becomes a mass of cells, out\r\nof which the harmonious diversity of the organs arranges itself, worm or\r\nman, as God has willed from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThis differentiation having been effected, each several part assumes its\r\nspecial office, having a life of its own adjusted to that of other parts\r\nand the whole. “Just as a tree constitutes a mass arranged in a definite\r\nmanner, in which, in every single part, in the leaves as in the root,\r\nin the trunk as in the blossom, cells are discovered to be the ultimate\r\nelements, so is it also with the forms of animal life. Every animal\r\npresents itself as a sum of vital unities, every one of which manifests\r\nall the characteristics of life.”\r\n\r\nThe mechanism is as clear, as unquestionable, as absolutely settled and\r\nuniversally accepted, as the order of movement of the heavenly bodies,\r\nwhich we compute backward to the days of the observatories on the plains\r\nof Shinar, and on the faith of which we regulate the movements of war\r\nand trade by the predictions of our ephemeris.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism, and that is all. We see the workman and the tools, but\r\nthe skill that guides the work and the power that performs it are as\r\ninvisible as ever. I fear that not every listener took the\r\nsignificance of those pregnant words in the passage I quoted from\r\nJohn Bell,--“thinking to discover its properties in its form.” We have\r\ndiscovered the working bee in this great hive of organization. We have\r\ndetected the cell in the very act of forming itself from a nucleus, of\r\ntransforming itself into various tissues, of selecting the elements of\r\nvarious secretions. But why one cell becomes nerve and another muscle,\r\nwhy one selects bile and another fat, we can no more pretend to tell,\r\nthan why one grape sucks out of the soil the generous juice which\r\nprinces hoard in their cellars, and another the wine which it takes\r\nthree men to drink,--one to pour it down, another to swallow it, and a\r\nthird to hold him while it is going down. Certain analogies between\r\nthis selecting power and the phenomena of endosmosis in the elective\r\naffinities of chemistry we can find, but the problem of force remains\r\nhere, as everywhere, unsolved and insolvable.\r\n\r\nDo we gain anything by attempting to get rid of the idea of a special\r\nvital force because we find certain mutually convertible relations\r\nbetween forces in the body and out of it? I think not, any more than we\r\nshould gain by getting rid of the idea and expression Magnetism because\r\nof its correlation with electricity. We may concede the unity of all\r\nforms of force, but we cannot overlook the fixed differences of its\r\nmanifestations according to the conditions under which it acts. It is a\r\nmistake, however, to think the mystery is greater in an organized body\r\nthan in any other. We see a stone fall or a crystal form, and there is\r\nnothing stranger left to wonder at, for we have seen the Infinite in\r\naction.\r\n\r\nJust so far as we can recognize the ordinary modes of operation of the\r\ncommon forces of nature,--gravity, cohesion, elasticity, transudation,\r\nchemical action, and the rest,--we see the so-called vital acts in\r\nthe light of a larger range of known facts and familiar analogies.\r\nMatteuecci's well-remembered lectures contain many and striking examples\r\nof the working of physical forces in physiological processes. Wherever\r\nrigid experiment carries us, we are safe in following this lead; but\r\nthe moment we begin to theorize beyond our strict observation, we are in\r\ndanger of falling into those mechanical follies which true science has\r\nlong outgrown.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the fact, then, that we have learned nothing but the\r\nmachinery of life, and are no nearer to its essence, what is it that we\r\nhave gained by this great discovery of the cell formation and function?\r\n\r\nIt would have been reward enough to learn the method Nature pursues\r\nfor its own sake. If the sovereign Artificer lets us into his own\r\nlaboratories and workshops, we need not ask more than the privilege\r\nof looking on at his work. We do not know where we now stand in the\r\nhierarchy of created intelligences. We were made a little lower than the\r\nangels. I speak it not irreverently; as the lower animals surpass man\r\nin some of their attributes, so it may be that not every angel's eye\r\ncan see as broadly and as deeply into the material works of God as\r\nman himself, looking at the firmament through an equatorial of fifteen\r\ninches' aperture, and searching into the tissues with a twelfth of an\r\ninch objective.\r\n\r\nBut there are other positive gains of a more practical character. Thus\r\nwe are no longer permitted to place the seat of the living actions in\r\nthe extreme vessels, which are only the carriers from which each part\r\ntakes what it wants by the divine right of the omnipotent nucleated\r\ncell. The organism has become, in the words already borrowed from\r\nVirchow, “a sum of vital unities.” The strictum and laxum, the increased\r\nand diminished action of the vessels, out of which medical theories\r\nand methods of treatment have grown up, have yielded to the doctrine\r\nof local cell-communities, belonging to this or that vascular district,\r\nfrom which they help themselves, as contractors are wont to do from the\r\nnational treasury.\r\n\r\nI cannot promise to do more than to select a few of the points of\r\ncontact between our ignorance and our knowledge which present particular\r\ninterest in the existing state of our physiological acquisitions.\r\nSome of them involve the microscopic discoveries of which I have\r\nbeen speaking, some belong to the domain of chemistry, and some have\r\nrelations with other departments of physical science.\r\n\r\nIf we should begin with the digestive function, we should find that the\r\nlong-agitated question of the nature of the acid of the gastric juice is\r\nbecoming settled in favor of the lactic. But the whole solvent agency of\r\nthe digestive fluid enters into the category of that exceptional mode of\r\naction already familiar to us in chemistry as catalysis. It is therefore\r\ndoubly difficult of explanation; first, as being, like all reactions,\r\na fact not to be accounted for except by the imaginative appeal to\r\n“affinity,” and secondly, as being one of those peculiar reactions\r\nprovoked by an element which stands outside and looks on without\r\ncompromising itself.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of Mulder, so widely diffused in popular and scientific\r\nbelief, of the existence of a common base of all albuminous substances,\r\nthe so-called protein, has not stood the test of rigorous analysis. The\r\ndivision of food into azotized and non-azotized is no doubt important,\r\nbut the attempt to show that the first only is plastic or nutritive,\r\nwhile the second is simply calorifacient, or heat-producing, fails\r\nentirely in the face of the facts revealed by the study of man in\r\ndifferent climates, and of numerous experiments in the feeding\r\nof animals. I must return to this subject in connection with the\r\nrespiratory function.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-making faculty of the liver is another “catalytic” mystery, as\r\ngreat as the rest of them, and no greater. Liver-tissue brings sugar out\r\nof the blood, or out of its own substance;--why?\r\n\r\n\r\n     Quia est in eo\r\n     Virtus saccharitiva.\r\n\r\nJust what becomes of the sugar beyond the fact of its disappearance\r\nbefore it can get into the general circulation and sweeten our tempers,\r\nit is hard to say.\r\n\r\nThe pancreatic fluid makes an emulsion of the fat contained in our food,\r\nbut just how the fatty particles get into the villi we must leave Brucke\r\nand Kolliker to settle if they can.\r\n\r\nNo one has shown satisfactorily the process by which the\r\nblood-corpuscles are formed out of the lymph-corpuscles, nor what\r\nbecomes of them. These two questions are like those famous household\r\npuzzles,--Where do the flies come from? and, Where do the pins go to?\r\n\r\nThere is a series of organs in the body which has long puzzled\r\nphysiologists,--organs of glandular aspect, but having no ducts,--the\r\nspleen, the thyroid and thymus bodies, and the suprarenal capsules. We\r\ncall them vascular glands, and we believe that they elaborate colored\r\nand uncolored blood-cells; but just what changes they effect, and\r\njust how they effect them, it has proved a very difficult matter to\r\ndetermine. So of the noted glandules which form Peyer's patches, their\r\nprecise office, though seemingly like those of the lymphatic glands,\r\ncannot be positively assigned, so far as I know, at the present time.\r\nIt is of obvious interest to learn it with reference to the pathology of\r\ntyphoid fever. It will be remarked that the coincidence of their changes\r\nin this disease with enlargement of the spleen suggests the idea of a\r\nsimilarity of function in these two organs.\r\n\r\nThe theories of the production of animal heat, from the times of Black,\r\nLavoisier, and Crawford to those of Liebig, are familiar to all who have\r\npaid any attention to physiological studies. The simplicity of Liebig's\r\nviews, and the popular form in which they have been presented, have\r\ngiven them wide currency, and incorporated them in the common belief and\r\nlanguage of our text-books. Direct oxidation or combustion of the carbon\r\nand hydrogen contained in the food, or in the tissues themselves; the\r\ndivision of alimentary substances into respiratory, or non-azotized,\r\nand azotized,--these doctrines are familiar even to the classes in our\r\nhigh-schools. But this simple statement is boldly questioned. Nothing\r\nproves that oxygen combines (in the system) with hydrogen and carbon\r\nin particular, rather than with sulphur and azote. Such is the\r\nwell-grounded statement of Robin and Verdeil. “It is very probable that\r\nanimal heat is entirely produced by the chemical actions which take\r\nplace in the organism, but the phenomenon is too complex to admit of our\r\ncalculating it according to the quality of oxygen consumed.” These last\r\nare the words of Regnault, as cited by Mr. Lewes, whose intelligent\r\ndiscussion of this and many of the most interesting physiological\r\nproblems I strongly recommend to your attention.\r\n\r\nThis single illustration covers a wider ground than the special function\r\nto which it belongs. We are learning that the chemistry of the body must\r\nbe studied, not simply by its ingesta and egesta, but that there is a\r\nlong intermediate series of changes which must be investigated in their\r\nown light, under their own special conditions. The expression “sum of\r\nvital unities” applies to the chemical actions, as well as to other\r\nactions localized in special parts; and when the distinguished chemists\r\nwhom I have just cited entitle their work a treatise on the immediate\r\nprinciples of the body, they only indicate the nature of that\r\nprofound and subtile analysis which must take the place of all hasty\r\ngeneralizations founded on a comparison of the food with residual\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nI will only call your attention to the fact, that the exceptional\r\nphenomenon of the laboratory is the prevailing law of the organism.\r\nNutrition itself is but one great catalytic process. As the blood\r\ntravels its rounds, each part selects its appropriate element and\r\ntransforms it to its own likeness. Whether the appropriating agent\r\nbe cell or nucleus, or a structureless solid like the intercellular\r\nsubstance of cartilage, the fact of its presence determines the\r\nseparation of its proper constituents from the circulating fluid, so\r\nthat even when we are wounded bone is replaced by bone, skin by skin,\r\nand nerve by nerve.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly without a smile that we resuscitate the old question of\r\nthe 'vis insita' of the muscular fibre, so famous in the discussions of\r\nHaller and his contemporaries. Speaking generally, I think we may say\r\nthat Haller's doctrine is the one now commonly received; namely, that\r\nthe muscles contract in virtue of their own inherent endowments. It\r\nis true that Kolliker says no perfectly decisive fact has been brought\r\nforward to prove that the striated muscles contract without having been\r\nacted on by nerves. Yet Mr. Bowman's observations on the contraction\r\nof isolated fibres appear decisive enough (unless we consider them\r\ninvalidated by Dr. Lionel Beale's recent researches), tending to show\r\nthat each elementary fibre is supplied with nerves; and as to the\r\nsmooth muscular fibres, we have Virchow's statement respecting the\r\ncontractility of those of the umbilical cord, where there is not a trace\r\nof any nerves.\r\n\r\nIn the investigation of the nervous system, anatomy and physiology have\r\ngone hand in hand. It is very singular that so important, and seemingly\r\nsimple, a fact as the connection of the nerve-tubes, at their origin or\r\nin their course, with the nerve-cells, should have so long remained open\r\nto doubt, as you may see that it did by referring to the very complete\r\nwork of Sharpey and Quain (edition of 1849), the histological portion of\r\nwhich is cordially approved by Kolliker himself.\r\n\r\nSeveral most interesting points of the minute anatomy of the nervous\r\ncentres have been laboriously and skilfully worked out by a recent\r\ngraduate of this Medical School, in a monograph worthy to stand in line\r\nwith those of Lockhart Clarke, Stilling, and Schroder van der Kolk. I\r\nhave had the privilege of examining and of showing some of you a number\r\nof Dr. Dean's skilful preparations. I have no space to give even an\r\nabstract of his conclusions. I can only refer to his proof of the fact,\r\nthat a single cell may send its processes into several different bundles\r\nof nerve-roots, and to his demonstration of the curved ascending and\r\ndescending fibres from the posterior nerveroots, to reach what he has\r\ncalled the longitudinal columns of the cornea. I must also mention Dr.\r\nDean's exquisite microscopic photographs from sections of the medulla\r\noblongata, which appear to me to promise a new development, if not a new\r\nepoch, in anatomical art.\r\n\r\nIt having been settled that the nerve-tubes can very commonly be traced\r\ndirectly to the nerve-cells, the object of all the observers in this\r\ndepartment of anatomy is to follow these tubes to their origin. We have\r\nan infinite snarl of telegraph wires, and we may be reasonably sure,\r\nthat, if we can follow them up, we shall find each of them ends in a\r\nbattery somewhere. One of the most interesting problems is to find the\r\nganglionic origin of the great nerves of the medulla oblongata, and this\r\nis the end to which, by the aid of the most delicate sections, colored\r\nso as to bring out their details, mounted so as to be imperishable,\r\nmagnified by the best instruments, and now self-recorded in the light\r\nof the truth-telling sunbeam, our fellow-student is making a steady\r\nprogress in a labor which I think bids fair to rank with the most\r\nvaluable contributions to histology that we have had from this side of\r\nthe Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see how old questions are incidentally settled in\r\nthe course of these new investigations. Thus, Mr. Clarke's dissections,\r\nconfirmed by preparations of Mr. Dean's which I have myself examined,\r\nplaced the fact of the decussation of the pyramids--denied by Haller, by\r\nMorgagni, and even by Stilling--beyond doubt. So the spinal canal, the\r\nexistence of which, at least in the adult, has been so often disputed,\r\nappears as a coarse and unequivocal anatomical fact in many of the\r\npreparations referred to.\r\n\r\nWhile these studies of the structure of the cord have been going on,\r\nthe ingenious and indefatigable Brown-Sequard has been investigating the\r\nfunctions of its different parts with equal diligence. The microscopic\r\nanatomists had shown that the ganglionic corpuscles of the gray matter\r\nof the cord are connected with each other by their processes, as well\r\nas with the nerve-roots. M. Brown-Sequard has proved by numerous\r\nexperiments that the gray substance transmits sensitive impressions and\r\nmuscular stimulation. The oblique ascending and descending fibres from\r\nthe posterior nerve-roots, joining the “longitudinal columns of the\r\ncornua,” account for the results of Brown-Sequard's sections of the\r\nposterior columns. The physiological experimenter has also made it\r\nevident that the decussation of the conductors of sensitive impressions\r\nhas its seat in the spinal core, and not in the encephalon, as had been\r\nsupposed. Not less remarkable than these results are the facts, which\r\nI with others of my audience have had the opportunity of observing, as\r\nshown by M. Brown-Sequard, of the artificial production of epilepsy in\r\nanimals by injuring the spinal cord, and the induction of the paroxysm\r\nby pinching a certain portion of the skin. I would also call the\r\nstudent's attention to his account of the relations of the nervous\r\ncentres to nutrition and secretion, the last of which relations has been\r\nmade the subject of an extended essay by our fellow countryman, Dr. H.\r\nF. Campbell of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe physiology of the spinal cord seems a simple matter as you study it\r\nin Longet. The experiments of Brown-Sequard have shown the problem to\r\nbe a complex one, and raised almost as many doubts as they have solved\r\nquestions; at any rate, I believe all lecturers on physiology agree that\r\nthere is no part of their task they dread so much as the analysis of the\r\nevidence relating to the special offices of the different portions of\r\nthe medulla spinalis. In the brain we are sure that we do not know\r\nhow to localize functions; in the spinal cord, we think we do know\r\nsomething; but there are so many anomalies, and seeming contradictions,\r\nand sources of fallacy, that beyond the facts of crossed paralysis of\r\nsensation, and the conducting agency of the gray substance, I am afraid\r\nwe retain no cardinal principles discovered since the development of the\r\nreflex function took its place by Sir Charles Bell's great discovery.\r\n\r\nBy the manner in which I spoke of the brain, you will see that I am\r\nobliged to leave phrenology sub Jove,--out in the cold,--as not one of\r\nthe household of science. I am not one of its haters; on the contrary, I\r\nam grateful for the incidental good it has done. I love to amuse myself\r\nin its plaster Golgothas, and listen to the glib professor, as he\r\ndiscovers by his manipulations\r\n\r\n\r\n   “All that disgraced my betters met in me.”\r\n\r\nI loved of old to see square-headed, heavy-jawed Spurzheim make a brain\r\nflower out into a corolla of marrowy filaments, as Vieussens had done\r\nbefore him, and to hear the dry-fibred but human-hearted George Combe\r\nteach good sense under the disguise of his equivocal system. But the\r\npseudo-sciences, phrenology and the rest, seem to me only appeals to\r\nweak minds and the weak points of strong ones. There is a pica or false\r\nappetite in many intelligences; they take to odd fancies in place of\r\nwholesome truth, as girls gnaw at chalk and charcoal. Phrenology juggles\r\nwith nature. It is so adjusted as to soak up all evidence that helps\r\nit, and shed all that harms it. It crawls forward in all weathers, like\r\nRichard Edgeworth's hygrometer. It does not stand at the boundary of our\r\nignorance, it seems to me, but is one of the will-o'-the-wisps of its\r\nundisputed central domain of bog and quicksand. Yet I should not have\r\ndevoted so many words to it, did I not recognize the light it has thrown\r\non human actions by its study of congenital organic tendencies. Its maps\r\nof the surface of the head are, I feel sure, founded on a delusion,\r\nbut its studies of individual character are always interesting and\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\nThe “snapping-turtle” strikes after its natural fashion when it first\r\ncomes out of the egg. Children betray their tendencies in their way of\r\ndealing with the breasts that nourish them; nay, lean venture to affirm,\r\nthat long before they are born they teach their mothers something of\r\ntheir turbulent or quiet tempers.\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Castor gaudet equis, ovo proanatus eodem\r\n     Pugnis.”\r\n\r\nStrike out the false pretensions of phrenology; call it anthropology;\r\nlet it study man the individual in distinction from man the abstraction,\r\nthe metaphysical or theological lay-figure; and it becomes “the proper\r\nstudy of mankind,” one of the noblest and most interesting of pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe whole physiology of the nervous system, from the simplest\r\nmanifestation of its power in an insect up to the supreme act of the\r\nhuman intelligence working through the brain, is full of the most\r\ndifficult yet profoundly interesting questions. The singular relations\r\nbetween electricity and nerve-force, relations which it has been\r\nattempted to interpret as meaning identity, in the face of palpable\r\ndifferences, require still more extended studies. You may be interested\r\nby Professor Faraday's statement of his opinion on the matter. “Though\r\nI am not satisfied that the nervous fluid is only electricity, still I\r\nthink that the agent in the nervous system maybe an inorganic force; and\r\nif there be reason for supposing that magnetism is a higher relation\r\nof force than electricity, so it may well be imagined that the nervous\r\npower may be of a still more exalted character, and yet within the reach\r\nof experiment.”\r\n\r\nIn connection with this statement, it is interesting to refer to the\r\nexperiments of Helmholtz on the rapidity of transmission of the nervous\r\nactions. The rate is given differently in Valentin's report of these\r\nexperiments and in that found in the “Scientific Annual” for 1858.\r\nOne hundred and eighty to three hundred feet per second is the rate\r\nof movement assigned for sensation, but all such results must be very\r\nvaguely approximative. Boxers, fencers, players at the Italian game\r\nof morn, “prestidigitators,” and all who depend for their success on\r\nrapidity of motion, know what differences there are in the personal\r\nequation of movement.\r\n\r\nReflex action, the mechanical sympathy, if I may so call it, of distant\r\nparts; Instinct, which is crystallized intelligence,--an absolute law\r\nwith its invariable planes and angles introduced into the sphere of\r\nconsciousness, as raphides are inclosed in the living cells of plants;\r\nIntellect,--the operation of the thinking principle through material\r\norgans, with an appreciable waste of tissue in every act of thought, so\r\nthat our clergymen's blood has more phosphates to get rid of on Monday\r\nthan on any other day of the week; Will,--theoretically the absolute\r\ndetermining power, practically limited in different degrees by the\r\nvarying organization of races and individuals, annulled or perverted\r\nby different ill-understood organic changes; on all these subjects our\r\nknowledge is in its infancy, and from the study of some of them the\r\ninterdict of the Vatican is hardly yet removed.\r\n\r\nI must allude to one or two points in the histology and physiology of\r\nthe organs of sense. The anterior continuation of the retina beyond\r\nthe ora serrata has been a subject of much discussion. If H. Muller and\r\nKolliker can be relied upon, this question is settled by recognizing\r\nthat a layer of cells, continued from the retina, passes over the\r\nsurface of the zonula Zinnii, but that no proper nervous element is so\r\nprolonged forward.\r\n\r\nI observe that Kolliker calls the true nervous elements of the retina\r\n“the layer of gray cerebral substance.” In fact, the ganglionic\r\ncorpuscles of each eye may be considered as constituting a little brain,\r\nconnected with the masses behind by the commissure, commonly called the\r\noptic nerve. We are prepared, therefore, to find these two little brains\r\nin the most intimate relations with each other, as we find the cerebral\r\nhemispheres. We know that they are directly connected by fibres that\r\narch round through the chiasma.\r\n\r\nI mention these anatomical facts to introduce a physiological\r\nobservation of my own, first announced in one of the lectures before the\r\nMedical Class, subsequently communicated to the American Academy of Arts\r\nand Sciences, and printed in its “Transactions” for February 14, 1860.\r\nI refer to the apparent transfer of impressions from one retina to\r\nthe other, to which I have given the name reflex vision. The idea was\r\nsuggested to me in consequence of certain effects noticed in employing\r\nthe stereoscope. Professor William B. Rodgers has since called the\r\nattention of the American Scientific Association to some facts bearing\r\non the subject, and to a very curious experiment of Leonardo da Vinci's,\r\nwhich enables the observer to look through the palm of his hand (or seem\r\nto), as if it had a hole bored through it. As he and others hesitated\r\nto accept my explanation, I was not sorry to find recently the following\r\nwords in the “Observations on Man” of that acute observer and thinker,\r\nDavid Hartley. “An impression made on the right eye alone by a single\r\nobject may propagate itself into the left, and there raise up an image\r\nalmost equal in vividness to itself; and consequently when we see with\r\none eye only, we may, however, have pictures in both eyes.” Hartley,\r\nin 1784, had anticipated many of the doctrines which have since been\r\nsystematized into the theory of reflex actions, and with which I have\r\nattempted to associate this act of reflex vision. My sixth experiment,\r\nhowever, in the communication referred to, appears to me to be a crucial\r\none, proving the correctness of my explanation, and I am not aware that\r\nit has been before instituted.\r\n\r\nAnother point of great interest connected with the physiology of\r\nvision, and involved for a long time in great obscurity, is that of the\r\nadjustment of the eye to different distances. Dr. Clay Wallace of New\r\nYork, who published a very ingenious little book on the eye about twenty\r\nyears ago, with vignettes reminding one of Bewick, was among the first,\r\nif not the first, to describe the ciliary muscle, to which the power of\r\nadjustment is generally ascribed. It is ascertained, by exact experiment\r\nwith the phacueidoscope, that accommodation depends on change of form of\r\nthe crystalline lens. Where the crystalline is wanting, as Mr. Ware long\r\nago taught, no power of accommodation remains. The ciliary muscle is\r\ngenerally thought to effect the change of form of the crystalline. The\r\npower of accommodation is lost after the application of atropine, in\r\nconsequence, as is supposed, of the paralysis of this muscle. This,\r\nI believe, is the nearest approach to a demonstration we have on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nI have only time briefly to refer to Professor Draper's most ingenious\r\ntheory as to the photographic nature of vision, for an account of which\r\nI must refer to his original and interesting Treatise on Physiology.\r\n\r\nIt were to be wished that the elaborate and very interesting researches\r\nof the Marquis Corti, which have revealed such singular complexity\r\nof structure in the cochlea of the ear, had done more to clear up its\r\ndoubtful physiology; but I am afraid we have nothing but hypotheses for\r\nthe special part it plays in the act of hearing, and that we must say\r\nthe same respecting the office of the semicircular canals.\r\n\r\nThe microscope has achieved some of its greatest triumphs in teaching\r\nus the changes which occur in the development of the embryo. No more\r\ninteresting discovery stands recorded in the voluminous literature\r\nof this subject than the one originally announced by Martin Barry,\r\nafterwards discredited, and still later confirmed by Mr. Newport and\r\nothers; namely the fact that the fertilizing filament reaches the\r\ninterior of the ovum in various animals;--a striking parallel to the\r\naction of the pollen-tube in the vegetable. But beyond the mechanical\r\nfacts all is mystery in the movements of organization, as profound as in\r\nthe fall of a stone or the formation of a crystal.\r\n\r\nTo the chemist and the microscopist the living body presents the same\r\ndifficulties, arising from the fact that everything is in perpetual\r\nchange in the organism. The fibrine of the blood puzzles the one as much\r\nas its globules puzzle the other. The difference between the branches of\r\nscience which deal with space only, and those which deal with space and\r\ntime, is this: we have no glasses that can magnify time. The figure I\r\nhere show you a was photographed from an object (pleurosigma angulatum)\r\nmagnified a thousand diameters, or presenting a million times its\r\nnatural surface. This other figure of the same object, enlarged from\r\nthe one just shown, is magnified seven thousand diameters, or forty-nine\r\nmillion times in surface. When we can make the forty-nine millionth of\r\na second as long as its integer, physiology and chemistry will approach\r\nnearer the completeness of anatomy.\r\n\r\nOur reverence becomes more worthy, or, if you will, less unworthy of its\r\nInfinite Object in proportion as our intelligence is lifted and expanded\r\nto a higher and broader understanding of the Divine methods of action.\r\nIf Galen called his heathen readers to admire, the power, the wisdom,\r\nthe providence, the goodness of the “Framer of the animal body,”--if Mr.\r\nBoyle, the student of nature, as Addison and that friend of his who had\r\nknown him for forty years tell us, never uttered the name of the Supreme\r\nBeing without making a distinct pause in his speech, in token of his\r\ndevout recognition of its awful meaning,--surely we, who inherit the\r\naccumulated wisdom of nearly two hundred years since the time of\r\nthe British philosopher, and of almost two thousand since the Greek\r\nphysician, may well lift our thoughts from the works we study to their\r\ngreat Artificer. These wonderful discoveries which we owe to that mighty\r\nlittle instrument, the telescope of the inner firmament with all\r\nits included worlds; these simple formulae by which we condense the\r\nobservations of a generation in a single axiom; these logical analyses\r\nby which we fence out the ignorance we cannot reclaim, and fix the\r\nlimits of our knowledge,--all lead us up to the inspiration of the\r\nAlmighty, which gives understanding to the world's great teachers. To\r\nfear science or knowledge, lest it disturb our old beliefs, is to fear\r\nthe influx of the Divine wisdom into the souls of our fellow-men; for\r\nwhat is science but the piecemeal revelation,--uncovering,--of the plan\r\nof creation, by the agency of those chosen prophets of nature whom God\r\nhas illuminated from the central light of truth for that single purpose?\r\n\r\nThe studies which we have glanced at are preliminary in your\r\neducation to the practical arts which make use of them,--the arts of\r\nhealing,--surgery and medicine. The more you examine the structure of\r\nthe organs and the laws of life, the more you will find how resolutely\r\neach of the cell-republics which make up the E pluribus unum of the body\r\nmaintains its independence. Guard it, feed it, air it, warm it, exercise\r\nor rest it properly, and the working elements will do their best to keep\r\nwell or to get well. What do we do with ailing vegetables? Dr. Warren,\r\nmy honored predecessor in this chair, bought a country-place, including\r\nhalf of an old orchard. A few years afterwards I saw the trees on his\r\nside of the fence looking in good health, while those on the other side\r\nwere scraggy and miserable. How do you suppose this change was brought\r\nabout? By watering them with Fowler's solution? By digging in calomel\r\nfreely about their roots? Not at all; but by loosening the soil\r\nround them, and supplying them with the right kind of food in fitting\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nNow a man is not a plant, or, at least, he is a very curious one, for\r\nhe carries his soil in his stomach, which is a kind--of portable\r\nflower-pot, and he grows round it, instead of out of it. He has,\r\nbesides, a singularly complex nutritive apparatus and a nervous system.\r\nBut recollect the doctrine already enunciated in the language of\r\nVirchow, that an animal, like a tree, is a sum of vital unities, of\r\nwhich the cell is the ultimate element. Every healthy cell, whether in\r\na vegetable or an animal, necessarily performs its function properly\r\nso long as it is supplied with its proper materials and stimuli. A cell\r\nmay, it is true, be congenitally defective, in which case disease is,\r\nso to speak, its normal state. But if originally sound and subsequently\r\ndiseased, there has certainly been some excess, deficiency, or wrong\r\nquality in the materials or stimuli applied to it. You remove this\r\ninjurious influence and substitute a normal one; remove the baked\r\ncoal-ashes, for instance, from the roots of a tree, and replace them\r\nwith loam; take away the salt meat from the patient's table, and replace\r\nit with fresh meat and vegetables, and the cells of the tree or the man\r\nreturn to their duty.\r\n\r\nI do not know that we ever apply to a plant any element which is not\r\na natural constituent of the vegetable structure, except perhaps\r\nexternally, for the accidental purpose of killing parasites. The whole\r\nart of cultivation consists in learning the proper food and conditions\r\nof plants, and supplying them. We give them water, earths, salts of\r\nvarious kinds such as they are made of, with a chance to help themselves\r\nto air and light. The farmer would be laughed at who undertook to\r\nmanure his fields or his trees with a salt of lead or of arsenic. These\r\nelements are not constituents of healthy plants. The gardener uses the\r\nwaste of the arsenic furnaces to kill the weeds in his walks.\r\n\r\nIf the law of the animal cell, and of the animal organism, which is\r\nbuilt up of such cells, is like that of the vegetable, we might expect\r\nthat we should treat all morbid conditions of any of the vital unities\r\nbelonging to an animal in the same way, by increasing, diminishing, or\r\nchanging its natural food or stimuli.\r\n\r\nThat is an aliment which nourishes; whatever we find in the organism, as\r\na constant and integral element, either forming part of its structure,\r\nor one of the conditions of vital processes, that and that only deserves\r\nthe name of aliment. I see no reason, therefore, why iron, phosphate of\r\nlime, sulphur, should not be considered food for man, as much as guano\r\nor poudrette for vegetables. Whether one or another of them is best in\r\nany given case,--whether they shall be taken alone or in combination, in\r\nlarge or small quantities, are separate questions. But they are elements\r\nbelonging to the body, and even in moderate excess will produce little\r\ndisturbance. There is no presumption against any of this class of\r\nsubstances, any more than against water or salt, provided they are used\r\nin fitting combinations, proportions, and forms.\r\n\r\nBut when it comes to substances alien to the healthy system, which never\r\nbelong to it as normal constituents, the case is very different. There\r\nis a presumption against putting lead or arsenic into the human body, as\r\nagainst putting them into plants, because they do not belong there,\r\nany more than pounded glass, which, it is said, used to be given as a\r\npoison. The same thing is true of mercury and silver. What becomes of\r\nthese alien substances after they get into the system we cannot always\r\ntell. But in the case of silver, from the accident of its changing color\r\nunder the influence of light, we do know what happens. It is thrown\r\nout, in part at least, under the epidermis, and there it remains to the\r\npatient's dying day. This is a striking illustration of the difficulty\r\nwhich the system finds in dealing with non-assimilable elements, and\r\njustifies in some measure the vulgar prejudice against mineral poisons.\r\n\r\nI trust the youngest student on these benches will not commit the\r\nchildish error of confounding a presumption against a particular class\r\nof agents with a condemnation of them. Mercury, for instance, is alien\r\nto the system, and eminently disturbing in its influence. Yet its\r\nefficacy in certain forms of specific disease is acknowledged by all\r\nbut the most sceptical theorists. Even the esprit moqueur of Ricord,\r\nthe Voltaire of pelvic literature, submits to the time-honored\r\nconstitutional authority of this great panacea in the class of cases\r\nto which he has devoted his brilliant intelligence. Still, there is\r\nno telling what evils have arisen from the abuse of this mineral.\r\nDr. Armstrong long ago pointed out some of them, and they have become\r\nmatters of common notoriety. I am pleased, therefore, when I find so\r\nable and experienced a practitioner as Dr. Williams of this city proving\r\nthat iritis is best treated without mercury, and Dr. Vanderpoel showing\r\nthe same thing to be true for pericarditis.\r\n\r\nWhatever elements nature does not introduce into vegetables, the\r\nnatural food of all animal life,--directly of herbivorous, indirectly of\r\ncarnivorous animals,--are to be regarded with suspicion. Arsenic-eating\r\nmay seem to improve the condition of horses for a time,--and even of\r\nhuman beings, if Tschudi's stories can be trusted,--but it soon appears\r\nthat its alien qualities are at war with the animal organization. So of\r\ncopper, antimony, and other non-alimentary simple substances; everyone\r\nof them is an intruder in the living system, as much as a constable\r\nwould be, quartered in our household. This does not mean that they may\r\nnot, any of them, be called in for a special need, as we send for the\r\nconstable when we have good reason to think we have a thief under our\r\nroof; but a man's body is his castle, as well as his house, and the\r\npresumption is that we are to keep our alimentary doors bolted against\r\nthese perturbing agents.\r\n\r\nNow the feeling is very apt to be just contrary to this. The habit has\r\nbeen very general with well-taught practitioners, to have recourse to\r\nthe introduction of these alien elements into the system on the occasion\r\nof any slight disturbance. The tongue was a little coated, and mercury\r\nmust be given; the skin was a little dry, and the patient must take\r\nantimony. It was like sending for the constable and the posse comitatus\r\nwhen there is only a carpet to shake or a refuse-barrel to empty. [Dr.\r\nJames Johnson advises persons not ailing to take five grains of blue\r\npill with one or two of aloes twice a week for three or four months in\r\nthe year, with half a pint of compound decoction of sarsaparilla every\r\nday for the same period, to preserve health and prolong life. Pract.\r\nTreatise on Dis. of Liver, etc. p. 272.] The constitution bears slow\r\npoisoning a great deal better than might be expected; yet the most\r\nintelligent men in the profession have gradually got out of the habit of\r\nprescribing these powerful alien substances in the old routine way.\r\nMr. Metcalf will tell you how much more sparingly they are given by our\r\npractitioners at the present time, than when he first inaugurated\r\nthe new era of pharmacy among us. Still, the presumption in favor of\r\npoisoning out every spontaneous reaction of outraged nature is\r\nnot extinct in those who are trusted with the lives of their\r\nfellow-citizens. “On examining the file of prescriptions at the\r\nhospital, I discovered that they were rudely written, and indicated a\r\ntreatment, as they consisted chiefly of tartar emetic, ipecacuanha, and\r\nepsom salts, hardly favorable to the cure of the prevailing diarrhoea\r\nand dysenteries.” In a report of a poisoning case now on trial, where we\r\nare told that arsenic enough was found in the stomach to produce death\r\nin twenty-four hours, the patient is said to have been treated by\r\narsenic, phosphorus, bryonia, aconite, nux vomica, and muriatic\r\nacid,--by a practitioner of what school it may be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe traditional idea of always poisoning out disease, as we smoke out\r\nvermin, is now seeking its last refuge behind the wooden cannon and\r\npainted port-holes of that unblushing system of false scientific\r\npretences which I do not care to name in a discourse addressed to an\r\naudience devoted to the study of the laws of nature in the light of the\r\nlaws of evidence. It is extraordinary to observe that the system which,\r\nby its reducing medicine to a name and a farce, has accustomed all who\r\nhave sense enough to see through its thin artifices to the idea that\r\ndiseases get well without being “cured,” should now be the main support\r\nof the tottering poison-cure doctrine. It has unquestionably helped\r\nto teach wise people that nature heals most diseases without help from\r\npharmaceutic art, but it continues to persuade fools that art can arrest\r\nthem all with its specifics.\r\n\r\nIt is worse than useless to attempt in any way to check the freest\r\nexpression of opinion as to the efficacy of any or all of the “heroic”\r\n means of treatment employed by practitioners of different schools and\r\nperiods. Medical experience is a great thing, but we must not forget\r\nthat there is a higher experience, which tries its results in a court\r\nof a still larger jurisdiction; that, namely, in which the laws of human\r\nbelief are summoned to the witness-box, and obliged to testify to the\r\nsources of error which beset the medical practitioner. The verdict is as\r\nold as the father of medicine, who announces it in the words, “judgment\r\nis difficult.” Physicians differed so in his time, that some denied that\r\nthere was any such thing as an art of medicine.\r\n\r\nOne man's best remedies were held as mischievous by another. The art of\r\nhealing was like soothsaying, so the common people said; “the same bird\r\nwas lucky or unlucky, according as he flew to the right or left.”\r\n\r\nThe practice of medicine has undergone great changes within the period\r\nof my own observation. Venesection, for instance, has so far gone out\r\nof fashion, that, as I am told by residents of the New York Bellevue\r\nand the Massachusetts General Hospitals, it is almost obsolete in\r\nthese institutions, at least in medical practice. The old Brunonian\r\nstimulating treatment has come into vogue again in the practice of Dr.\r\nTodd and his followers. The compounds of mercury have yielded their\r\nplace as drugs of all work, and specifics for that very frequent\r\nsubjective complaint, nescio quid faciam,--to compounds of iodine. [Sir\r\nAstley Cooper has the boldness,--or honesty,--to speak of medicines\r\nwhich “are given as much to assist the medical man as his patient.”\r\n Lectures (London, 1832), p. 14.] Opium is believed in, and quinine,\r\nand “rum,” using that expressive monosyllable to mean all alcoholic\r\ncordials. If Moliere were writing now, instead of saignare, purgare,\r\nand the other, he would be more like to say, Stimulare, opium dare et\r\npotassio-iodizare.\r\n\r\nI have been in relation successively with the English and American\r\nevacuant and alterative practice, in which calomel and antimony figured\r\nso largely that, as you may see in Dr. Jackson's last “Letter,” Dr.\r\nHolyoke, a good representative of sterling old-fashioned medical art,\r\ncounted them with opium and Peruvian bark as his chief remedies; with\r\nthe moderately expectant practice of Louis; the blood-letting “coup\r\nsur coup” of Bouillaud; the contra-stimulant method of Rasori and his\r\nfollowers; the anti-irritant system of Broussais, with its leeching\r\nand gum-water; I have heard from our own students of the simple opium\r\npractice of the renowned German teacher, Oppolzer; and now I find the\r\nmedical community brought round by the revolving cycle of opinion to\r\nthat same old plan of treatment which John Brown taught in Edinburgh\r\nin the last quarter of the last century, and Miner and Tully fiercely\r\nadvocated among ourselves in the early years of the present. The\r\nworthy physicians last mentioned, and their antagonist Dr. Gallup, used\r\nstronger language than we of these degenerate days permit ourselves.\r\n“The lancet is a weapon which annually slays more than the sword,” says\r\nDr. Tully. “It is probable that, for forty years past, opium and\r\nits preparations have done seven times the injury they have rendered\r\nbenefit, on the great scale of the world,” says Dr. Gallup.\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of these perpetual changes and conflicts of medical\r\nopinion and practice, from an early antiquity to our own time? Simply\r\nthis: all “methods” of treatment end in disappointment of those\r\nextravagant expectations which men are wont to entertain of medical art.\r\nThe bills of mortality are more obviously affected by drainage, than by\r\nthis or that method of practice. The insurance companies do not commonly\r\ncharge a different percentage on the lives of the patients of this or\r\nthat physician. In the course of a generation, more or less, physicians\r\nthemselves are liable to get tired of a practice which has so little\r\neffect upon the average movement of vital decomposition. Then they are\r\nready for a change, even if it were back again to a method which has\r\nalready been tried, and found wanting.\r\n\r\nOur practitioners, or many of them, have got back to the ways of old Dr.\r\nSamuel Danforth, who, as it is well known, had strong objections to\r\nthe use of the lancet. By and by a new reputation will be made by some\r\ndiscontented practitioner, who, tired of seeing patients die with their\r\nskins full of whiskey and their brains muddy with opium, returns to a\r\nbold antiphlogistic treatment, and has the luck to see a few patients\r\nof note get well under it. So of the remedies which have gone out of\r\nfashion and been superseded by others. It can hardly be doubted that\r\nthey will come into vogue again, more or less extensively, under the\r\ninfluence of that irresistible demand for change just referred to.\r\n\r\nThen will come the usual talk about a change in the character\r\nof disease, which has about as much meaning as that concerning\r\n“old-fashioned snow-storms.” “Epidemic constitutions” of disease mean\r\nsomething, no doubt; a great deal as applied to malarious affections;\r\nbut that the whole type of diseases undergoes such changes that the\r\npractice must be reversed from depleting to stimulating, and vice versa,\r\nis much less likely than that methods of treatment go out of fashion and\r\ncome in again. If there is any disease which claims its percentage with\r\nreasonable uniformity, it is phthisis. Yet I remember that the reverend\r\nand venerable Dr. Prince of Salem told me one Commencement day, as I was\r\njogging along towards Cambridge with him, that he recollected the time\r\nwhen that disease was hardly known; and in confirmation of his\r\nstatement mentioned a case in which it was told as a great event, that\r\nsomebody down on “the Cape” had died of “a consumption.” This story does\r\nnot sound probable to myself, as I repeat it, yet I assure you it is\r\ntrue, and it shows how cautiously we must receive all popular stories of\r\ngreat changes in the habits of disease.\r\n\r\nIs there no progress, then, but do we return to the same beliefs and\r\npractices which our forefathers wore out and threw away? I trust and\r\nbelieve that there is a real progress. We may, for instance, return in\r\na measure to the Brunonian stimulating system, but it must be in a\r\nmodified way, for we cannot go back to the simple Brunonian pathology,\r\nsince we have learned too much of diseased action to accept its\r\nconvenient dualism. So of other doctrines, each new Avatar strips them\r\nof some of their old pretensions, until they take their fitting place\r\nat last, if they have any truth in them, or disappear, if they were mere\r\nphantasms of the imagination.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, while medical theories are coming in and going out,\r\nthere is a set of sensible men who are never run away with by them, but\r\npractise their art sagaciously and faithfully in much the same way from\r\ngeneration to generation. From the time of Hippocrates to that of our\r\nown medical patriarch, there has been an apostolic succession of wise\r\nand good practitioners. If you will look at the first aphorism of the\r\nancient Master you will see that before all remedies he places the\r\nproper conduct of the patient and his attendants, and the fit ordering\r\nof all the conditions surrounding him. The class of practitioners I have\r\nreferred to have always been the most faithful in attending to these\r\npoints. No doubt they have sometimes prescribed unwisely, in compliance\r\nwith the prejudices of their time, but they have grown wiser as they\r\nhave grown older, and learned to trust more in nature and less in their\r\nplans of interference. I believe common opinion confirms Sir James\r\nClark's observation to this effect.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the profession must, I think, run parallel with that\r\nof the wisest of its individual members. Each time a plan of treatment\r\nor a particular remedy comes up for trial, it is submitted to a sharper\r\nscrutiny. When Cullen wrote his Materia Medica, he had seriously to\r\nassail the practice of giving burnt toad, which was still countenanced\r\nby at least one medical authority of note. I have read recently in some\r\nmedical journal, that an American practitioner, whose name is known to\r\nthe country, is prescribing the hoof of a horse for epilepsy. It was\r\ndoubtless suggested by that old fancy of wearing a portion of elk's hoof\r\nhung round the neck or in a ring, for this disease. But it is hard\r\nto persuade reasonable people to swallow the abominations of a former\r\nperiod. The evidence which satisfied Fernelius will not serve one of our\r\nhospital physicians.\r\n\r\nIn this way those articles of the Materia Medica which had nothing but\r\nloathsomeness to recommend them have been gradually dropped, and are not\r\nlike to obtain any general favor again with civilized communities. The\r\nnext culprits to be tried are the poisons. I have never been in the\r\nleast sceptical as to the utility of some of them, when properly\r\nemployed. Though I believe that at present, taking the world at large,\r\nand leaving out a few powerful agents of such immense value that they\r\nrank next to food in importance, the poisons prescribed for disease do\r\nmore hurt than good, I have no doubt, and never professed to have any,\r\nthat they do much good in prudent and instructed hands. But I am very\r\nwilling to confess a great jealousy of many agents, and I could almost\r\nwish to see the Materia Medica so classed as to call suspicion upon\r\ncertain ones among them.\r\n\r\nThus the alien elements, those which do not properly enter into\r\nthe composition of any living tissue, are the most to be suspected,\r\n--mercury, lead, antimony, silver, and the rest, for the reasons I have\r\nbefore mentioned. Even iodine, which, as it is found in certain plants,\r\nseems less remote from the animal tissues, gives unequivocal proofs\r\nfrom time to time that it is hostile to some portions of the glandular\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, less prima facie objection to those agents which\r\nconsist of assimilable elements, such as are found making a part\r\nof healthy tissues. These are divisible into three classes,--foods,\r\npoisons, and inert, mostly because insoluble, substances. The food of\r\none animal or of one human being is sometimes poison to another, and\r\nvice versa; inert substances may act mechanically, so as to produce\r\nthe effect of poisons; but this division holds exactly enough for our\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, every poison consisting of assimilable elements may\r\nbe considered as unwholesome food. It is rejected by the stomach, or it\r\nproduces diarrhoea, or it causes vertigo or disturbance of the heart's\r\naction, or some other symptom for which the subject of it would consult\r\nthe physician, if it came on from any other cause than taking it under\r\nthe name of medicine. Yet portions of this unwholesome food which\r\nwe call medicine, we have reason to believe, are assimilated; thus,\r\ncastor-oil appears to be partially digested by infants, so that they\r\nrequire large doses to affect them medicinally. Even that deadliest of\r\npoisons, hydrocyanic acid, is probably assimilated, and helps to make\r\nliving tissue, if it do not kill the patient, for the assimilable\r\nelements which it contains, given in the separate forms of amygdalin and\r\nemulsin, produce no disturbance, unless, as in Bernard's experiments,\r\nthey are suffered to meet in the digestive organs. A medicine consisting\r\nof assimilable substances being then simply unwholesome food, we\r\nunderstand what is meant by those cumulative effects of such remedies\r\noften observed, as in the case of digitalis and strychnia. They are\r\nprecisely similar to the cumulative effects of a salt diet in producing\r\nscurvy, or of spurred rye in producing dry gangrene. As the effects of\r\nsuch substances are a violence to the organs, we should exercise the\r\nsame caution with regard to their use that we would exercise about\r\nany other kind of poisonous food,--partridges at certain seasons, for\r\ninstance. Even where these poisonous kinds of food seem to be useful, we\r\nshould still regard them with great jealousy. Digitalis lowers the pulse\r\nin febrile conditions. Veratrum viride does the same thing. How do we\r\nknow that a rapid pulse is not a normal adjustment of nature to the\r\ncondition it accompanies? Digitalis has gone out of favor; how sure are\r\nwe that Veratrum viride will not be found to do more harm than good in\r\na case of internal inflammation, taking the whole course of the disease\r\ninto consideration? Think of the change of opinion with regard to the\r\nuse of opium in delirium tremens (which you remember is sometimes called\r\ndelirium vigilans), where it seemed so obviously indicated, since the\r\npublication of Dr. Ware's admirable essay. I respect the evidence of\r\nmy contemporaries, but I cannot forget the sayings of the Father of\r\nmedicine,--Ars longa, judicium difficile.\r\n\r\nI am not presuming to express an opinion concerning Veratrum viride,\r\nwhich was little heard of when I was still practising medicine. I am\r\nonly appealing to that higher court of experience which sits in judgment\r\non all decisions of the lower medical tribunals, and which requires more\r\nthan one generation for its final verdict.\r\n\r\nOnce change the habit of mind so long prevalent among practitioners of\r\nmedicine; once let it be everywhere understood that the presumption is\r\nin favor of food, and not of alien substances, of innocuous, and not\r\nof unwholesome food, for the sick; that this presumption requires very\r\nstrong evidence in each particular case to overcome it; but that, when\r\nsuch evidence is afforded, the alien substance or the unwholesome food\r\nshould be given boldly, in sufficient quantities, in the same spirit as\r\nthat with which the surgeon lifts his knife against a patient,--that\r\nis, with the same reluctance and the same determination,--and I think\r\nwe shall have and hear much less of charlatanism in and out of the\r\nprofession. The disgrace of medicine has been that colossal system of\r\nself-deception, in obedience to which mines have been emptied of their\r\ncankering minerals, the vegetable kingdom robbed of all its noxious\r\ngrowths, the entrails of animals taxed for their impurities,\r\nthe poison-bags of reptiles drained of their venom, and all the\r\ninconceivable abominations thus obtained thrust down the throats of\r\nhuman beings suffering from some fault of organization, nourishment, or\r\nvital stimulation.\r\n\r\nMuch as we have gained, we have not yet thoroughly shaken off the notion\r\nthat poison is the natural food of disease, as wholesome aliment is\r\nthe support of health. Cowper's lines, in “The Task,” show the\r\nmatter-of-course practice of his time:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “He does not scorn it, who has long endured\r\n   A fever's agonies, and fed on drugs.”\r\n\r\nDr. Kimball of Lowell, who has been in the habit of seeing a great\r\ndeal more of typhoid fever than most practitioners, and whose surgical\r\nexploits show him not to be wanting in boldness or enterprise, can tell\r\nyou whether he finds it necessary to feed his patients on drugs or not.\r\nHis experience is, I believe, that of the most enlightened and advanced\r\nportion of the profession; yet I think that even in typhoid fever, and\r\ncertainly in many other complaints, the effects of ancient habits\r\nand prejudices may still be seen in the practice of some educated\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\nTo you, young men, it belongs to judge all that has gone before you.\r\nYou come nearer to the great fathers of modern medicine than some of you\r\nimagine. Three of my own instructors attended Dr. Rush's Lectures. The\r\nillustrious Haller mentions Rush's inaugural thesis in his “Bibliotheca\r\nAnatomica;” and this same Haller, brought so close to us, tells us he\r\nremembers Ruysch, then an old man, and used to carry letters between him\r\nand Boerhaave. Look through the history of medicine from Boerhaave\r\nto this present day. You will see at once that medical doctrine and\r\npractice have undergone a long series of changes. You will see that\r\nthe doctrine and practice of our own time must probably change in their\r\nturn, and that, if we can trust at all to the indications of their\r\ncourse, it will be in the direction of an improved hygiene and a\r\nsimplified treatment. Especially will the old habit of violating the\r\ninstincts of the sick give place to a judicious study of these same\r\ninstincts. It will be found that bodily, like mental insanity, is best\r\nmanaged, for the most part, by natural soothing agencies. Two centuries\r\nago there was a prescription for scurvy containing “stercoris taurini\r\net anserini par, quantitas trium magnarum nucum,” of the hell-broth\r\ncontaining which “guoties-cumque sitit oeger, large bibit.” When I\r\nhave recalled the humane common-sense of Captain Cook in the matter\r\nof preventing this disease; when I have heard my friend, Mr. Dana,\r\ndescribing the avidity with which the scurvy-stricken sailors snuffed up\r\nthe earthy fragrance of fresh raw potatoes, the food which was to supply\r\nthe elements wanting to their spongy tissues, I have recognized that the\r\nperfection of art is often a return to nature, and seen in this single\r\ninstance the germ of innumerable beneficent future medical reforms.\r\n\r\nI cannot help believing that medical curative treatment will by and\r\nby resolve itself in great measure into modifications of the food,\r\nswallowed and breathed, and of the natural stimuli, and that less will\r\nbe expected from specifics and noxious disturbing agents, either alien\r\nor assimilable. The noted mineral-waters containing iron, sulphur,\r\ncarbonic acid, supply nutritious or stimulating materials to the body\r\nas much as phosphate of lime and ammoniacal compounds do to the cereal\r\nplants. The effects of a milk and vegetable diet, of gluten bread\r\nin diabetes, of cod-liver oil in phthisis, even of such audacious\r\ninnovations as the water-cure and the grape-cure, are only hints of\r\nwhat will be accomplished when we have learned to discover what organic\r\nelements are deficient or in excess in a case of chronic disease,\r\nand the best way of correcting the abnormal condition, just as an\r\nagriculturist ascertains the wants of his crops and modifies the\r\ncomposition of his soil. In acute febrile diseases we have long ago\r\ndiscovered that far above all drug-medication is the use of mild liquid\r\ndiet in the period of excitement, and of stimulant and nutritious food\r\nin that of exhaustion. Hippocrates himself was as particular about his\r\nbarley-ptisan as any Florence Nightingale of our time could be.\r\n\r\nThe generation to which you, who are just entering the profession,\r\nbelong, will make a vast stride forward, as I believe, in the direction\r\nof treatment by natural rather than violent agencies. What is it that\r\nmakes the reputation of Sydenham, as the chief of English physicians?\r\nHis prescriptions consisted principally of simples. An aperient or an\r\nopiate, a “cardiac” or a tonic, may be commonly found in the midst of\r\na somewhat fantastic miscellany of garden herbs. It was not by his\r\npharmaceutic prescriptions that he gained his great name. It was\r\nby daring to order fresh air for small-pox patients, and riding on\r\nhorseback for consumptives, in place of the smothering system, and\r\nthe noxious and often loathsome rubbish of the established schools. Of\r\ncourse Sydenham was much abused by his contemporaries, as he frequently\r\ntakes occasion to remind his reader. “I must needs conclude,” he says,\r\n“either that I am void of merit, or that the candid and ingenuous part\r\nof mankind, who are formed with so excellent a temper of mind as to be\r\nno strangers to gratitude, make a very small part of the whole.” If in\r\nthe fearless pursuit of truth you should find the world as ungracious in\r\nthe nineteenth century as he found it in the seventeenth, you may learn\r\na lesson of self-reliance from another utterance of the same illustrious\r\nphysician: “'T is none of my business to inquire what other persons\r\nthink, but to establish my own observations; in order to which, I ask no\r\nfavor of the reader but to peruse my writings with temper.”\r\n\r\nThe physician has learned a great deal from the surgeon, who is\r\nnaturally in advance of him, because he has a better opportunity of\r\nseeing the effects of his remedies. Let me shorten one of Ambroise\r\nPare's stories for you. There had been a great victory at the pass of\r\nSusa, and they were riding into the city. The wounded cried out as the\r\nhorses trampled them under their hoofs, which caused good Ambroise great\r\npity, and made him wish himself back in Paris. Going into a stable he\r\nsaw four dead soldiers, and three desperately wounded, placed with their\r\nbacks against the wall. An old campaigner came up.--“Can these fellows\r\nget well?” he said. “No!” answered the surgeon. Thereupon, the old\r\nsoldier walked up to them and cut all their throats, sweetly, and\r\nwithout wrath (doulcement et sans cholere). Ambroise told him he was a\r\nbad man to do such a thing. “I hope to God;” he said, “somebody will\r\ndo as much for me if I ever get into such a scrape” (accoustre de telle\r\nfacon). “I was not much salted in those days” (bien doux de sel), says\r\nAmbroise, “and little acquainted with the treatment of wounds.” However,\r\nas he tells us, he proceeded to apply boiling oil of Sambuc (elder)\r\nafter the approved fashion of the time,--with what torture to the\r\npatient may be guessed. At last his precious oil gave out, and he used\r\ninstead an insignificant mixture of his own contrivance. He could not\r\nsleep that night for fear his patients who had not been scalded with\r\nthe boiling oil would be poisoned by the gunpowder conveyed into their\r\nwounds by the balls. To his surprise, he found them much better than the\r\nothers the next morning, and resolved never again to burn his patients\r\nwith hot oil for gun-shot wounds.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning, as nearly as we can fix it, of that reform which\r\nhas introduced plain water-dressings in the place of the farrago of\r\nexternal applications which had been a source of profit to apothecaries\r\nand disgrace to art from, and before, the time when Pliny complained\r\nof them. A young surgeon who was at Sudley Church, laboring among the\r\nwounded of Bull Run, tells me they had nothing but water for dressing,\r\nand he (being also doux de sel) was astonished to see how well the\r\nwounds did under that simple treatment.\r\n\r\nLet me here mention a fact or two which may be of use to some of you who\r\nmean to enter the public service. You will, as it seems, have gun-shot\r\nwounds almost exclusively to deal with. Three different surgeons, the\r\none just mentioned and two who saw the wounded of Big Bethel, assured me\r\nthat they found no sabre-cuts or bayonet wounds. It is the rifle-bullet\r\nfrom a safe distance which pierces the breasts of our soldiers, and not\r\nthe gallant charge of broad platoons and sweeping squadrons, such as\r\nwe have been in the habit of considering the chosen mode of warfare\r\nof ancient and modern chivalry. [Sir Charles James Napier had the same\r\nexperience in Virginia in 1813. “Potomac. We have nasty sort of fighting\r\nhere, amongst creeks and bushes, and lose men without show.” “Yankee\r\nnever shows himself, he keeps in the thickest wood, fires and runs\r\noff.”--“These five thousand in the open field might be attacked,\r\nbut behind works it would be throwing away lives.” He calls it “an\r\ninglorious warfare,”--says one of the leaders is “a little deficient in\r\ngumption,--but--still my opinion is, that if we tuck up our sleeves and\r\nlay our ears back we might thrash them; that is, if we caught them out\r\nof their trees, so as to slap at them with the bayonet.”--Life, etc.\r\nvol. i. p. 218 et seq.]\r\n\r\nAnother fact parallels the story of the old campaigner, and may teach\r\nsome of you caution in selecting your assistants. A chaplain told it\r\nto two of our officers personally known to myself. He overheard the\r\nexamination of a man who wished to drive one of the “avalanche” wagons,\r\nas they call them. The man was asked if he knew how to deal with wounded\r\nmen. “Oh yes,” he answered; “if they're hit here,” pointing to the\r\nabdomen, “knock 'em on the head,--they can't get well.”\r\n\r\nIn art and outside of it you will meet the same barbarisms that Ambroise\r\nPare met with,--for men differ less from century to century than we are\r\napt to suppose; you will encounter the same opposition, if you attack\r\nany prevailing opinion, that Sydenham complained of. So far as possible,\r\nlet not such experiences breed in you a contempt for those who are the\r\nsubjects of folly or prejudice, or foster any love of dispute for its\r\nown sake. Should you become authors, express your opinions freely;\r\ndefend them rarely. It is not often that an opinion is worth expressing,\r\nwhich cannot take care of itself. Opposition is the best mordant to fix\r\nthe color of your thought in the general belief.\r\n\r\nIt is time to bring these crowded remarks to a close. The day has been\r\nwhen at the beginning of a course of Lectures I should have thought it\r\nfitting to exhort you to diligence and entire devotion to your tasks\r\nas students. It is not so now. The young man who has not heard the\r\nclarion-voices of honor and of duty now sounding throughout the land,\r\nwill heed no word of mine. In the camp or the city, in the field or the\r\nhospital, under sheltering roof, or half-protecting canvas, or open\r\nsky, shedding our own blood or stanching that of our wounded defenders,\r\nstudents or teachers, whatever our calling and our ability, we belong,\r\nnot to ourselves, but to our imperilled country, whose danger is our\r\ncalamity, whose ruin would be our enslavement, whose rescue shall be our\r\nearthly salvation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOLASTIC AND BEDSIDE TEACHING.\r\n\r\nAn Introductory Lecture delivered before the Medical Class of Harvard\r\nUniversity, November 6, 1867.\r\n\r\nThe idea is entertained by some of our most sincere professional\r\nbrethren, that to lengthen and multiply our Winter Lectures will be\r\nof necessity to advance the cause of medical education. It is a fair\r\nsubject for consideration whether they do not overrate the relative\r\nimportance of that particular mode of instruction which forms the larger\r\npart of these courses.\r\n\r\nAs this School could only lengthen its lecture term at the expense\r\nof its “Summer Session,” in which more direct, personal, and familiar\r\nteaching takes the place of our academic discourses, and in which more\r\ntime can be given to hospitals, infirmaries, and practical instruction\r\nin various important specialties, whatever might be gained, a good deal\r\nwould certainly be lost in our case by the exchange.\r\n\r\nThe most essential part of a student's instruction is obtained, as I\r\nbelieve, not in the lecture-room, but at the bedside. Nothing seen there\r\nis lost; the rhythms of disease are learned by frequent repetition; its\r\nunforeseen occurrences stamp themselves indelibly in the memory. Before\r\nthe student is aware of what he has acquired, he has learned the aspects\r\nand course and probable issue of the diseases he has seen with his\r\nteacher, and the proper mode of dealing with them, so far as his master\r\nknows it. On the other hand, our ex cathedra prelections have a strong\r\ntendency to run into details which, however interesting they may be to\r\nourselves and a few of our more curious listeners, have nothing in them\r\nwhich will ever be of use to the student as a practitioner. It is a\r\nperfectly fair question whether I and some other American Professors do\r\nnot teach quite enough that is useless already. Is it not well to remind\r\nthe student from time to time that a physician's business is to avert\r\ndisease, to heal the sick, to prolong life, and to diminish suffering?\r\nIs it not true that the young man of average ability will find it as\r\nmuch as he can do to fit himself for these simple duties? Is it not\r\nbest to begin, at any rate, by making sure of such knowledge as he will\r\nrequire in his daily walk, by no means discouraging him from any study\r\nfor which his genius fits him when he once feels that he has become\r\nmaster of his chosen art.\r\n\r\nI know that many branches of science are of the greatest value as\r\nfeeders of our medical reservoirs. But the practising physician's office\r\nis to draw the healing waters, and while he gives his time to this\r\nlabor he can hardly be expected to explore all the sources that spread\r\nthemselves over the wide domain of science. The traveller who would not\r\ndrink of the Nile until he had tracked it to its parent lakes, would be\r\nlike to die of thirst; and the medical practitioner who would not use\r\nthe results of many laborers in other departments without sharing their\r\nspecial toils, would find life far too short and art immeasurably too\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nWe owe much to Chemistry, one of the most captivating as well as\r\nimportant of studies; but the medical man must as a general rule content\r\nhimself with a clear view of its principles and a limited acquaintance\r\nwith its facts; such especially as are pertinent to his pursuits. I am\r\nin little danger of underrating Anatomy or Physiology; but as each of\r\nthese branches splits up into specialties, any one of which may take up\r\na scientific life-time, I would have them taught with a certain judgment\r\nand reserve, so that they shall not crowd the more immediately\r\npractical branches. So of all the other ancillary and auxiliary kinds\r\nof knowledge, I would have them strictly subordinated to that particular\r\nkind of knowledge for which the community looks to its medical advisers.\r\n\r\nA medical school is not a scientific school, except just so far as\r\nmedicine itself is a science. On the natural history side, medicine is\r\na science; on the curative side, chiefly an art. This is implied in\r\nHufeland's aphorism: “The physician must generalize the disease and\r\nindividualize the patient.”\r\n\r\nThe coordinated and classified results of empirical observation, in\r\ndistinction from scientific experiment, have furnished almost all we\r\nknow about food, the medicine of health, and medicine, the food of\r\nsickness. We eat the root of the Solanum tuberosum and throw away its\r\nfruit; we eat the fruit of the Solanum Lycopersicum and throw away its\r\nroot. Nothing but vulgar experience has taught us to reject the potato\r\nball and cook the tomato. So of most of our remedies. The subchloride\r\nof mercury, calomel, is the great British specific; the protochloride of\r\nmercury, corrosive sublimate, kills like arsenic, but no chemist could\r\nhave told us it would be so.\r\n\r\nFrom observations like these we can obtain certain principles from which\r\nwe can argue deductively to facts of a like nature, but the process\r\nis limited, and we are suspicious of all reasoning in that direction\r\napplied to the processes of healthy and diseased life. We are\r\ncontinually appealing to special facts. We are willing to give Liebig's\r\nartificial milk when we cannot do better, but we watch the child\r\nanxiously whose wet-nurse is a chemist's pipkin. A pair of substantial\r\nmammary glands has the advantage over the two hemispheres of the most\r\nlearned Professor's brain, in the art of compounding a nutritious fluid\r\nfor infants.\r\n\r\nThe bedside is always the true centre of medical teaching. Certain\r\nbranches must be taught in the lecture-room, and will necessarily\r\ninvolve a good deal that is not directly useful to the future\r\npractitioner. But the over ambitious and active student must not be led\r\naway by the seduction of knowledge for its own sake from his principal\r\npursuit. The humble beginner, who is alarmed at the vast fields of\r\nknowledge opened to him, may be encouraged by the assurance that with a\r\nvery slender provision of science, in distinction from practical skill,\r\nhe may be a useful and acceptable member of the profession to which the\r\nhealth of the community is intrusted.\r\n\r\nTo those who are not to engage in practice, the various pursuits\r\nof science hardly require to be commended. Only they must not be\r\ndisappointed if they find many subjects treated in our courses as a\r\nmedical class requires, rather than as a scientific class would expect,\r\nthat is, with special limitations and constant reference to practical\r\nends. Fortunately they are within easy reach of the highest scientific\r\ninstruction. The business of a school like this is to make useful\r\nworking physicians, and to succeed in this it is almost as important not\r\nto overcrowd the mind of the pupil with merely curious knowledge as it\r\nis to store it with useful information.\r\n\r\nIn this direction I have written my lecture, not to undervalue any form\r\nof scientific labor in its place, an unworthy thought from which I hope\r\nI need not defend myself,--but to discourage any undue inflation of the\r\nscholastic programme, which even now asks more of the student than the\r\nteacher is able to obtain from the great majority of those who present\r\nthemselves for examination. I wish to take a hint in education from the\r\nSecretary of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture, who regards the\r\ncultivation of too much land as a great defect in our New England\r\nfarming. I hope that our Medical Institutions may never lay themselves\r\nopen to the kind of accusation Mr. Lowe brings against the English\r\nUniversities, when he says that their education is made up “of words\r\nthat few understand and most will shortly forget; of arts that can never\r\nbe used, if indeed they can even be learnt; of histories inapplicable to\r\nour times; of languages dead and even mouldy; of grammatical rules\r\nthat never had living use and are only post mortem examinations; and of\r\nstatements fagoted with utter disregard of their comparative value.”\r\n\r\nThis general thought will be kept in view throughout my somewhat\r\ndiscursive address, which will begin with an imaginary clinical lesson\r\nfrom the lips of an historical personage, and close with the portrait\r\nfrom real life of one who, both as teacher and practitioner, was long\r\nloved and honored among us. If I somewhat overrun my hour, you must\r\npardon me, for I can say with Pascal that I have not had the time to\r\nmake my lecture shorter.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1647, that good man John Eliot, commonly called the Apostle\r\nEliot, writing to Mr. Thomas Shepherd, the pious minister of Cambridge,\r\nreferring to the great need of medical instruction for the Indians, used\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n“I have thought in my heart that it were a singular good work, if\r\nthe Lord would stirre up the hearts of some or other of his people\r\nin England to give some maintenance toward some Schoole or Collegiate\r\nexercise this way, wherein there should be Anatomies and other\r\ninstructions that way, and where there might be some recompence given to\r\nany that should bring in any vegetable or other thing that is vertuous\r\nin the way of Physick.\r\n\r\n“There is another reason which moves my thought and desires this way,\r\nnamely that our young students in Physick may be trained up better then\r\nthey yet bee, who have onely theoreticall knowledge, and are forced to\r\nfall to practise before ever they saw an Anatomy made, or duely trained\r\nup in making experiments, for we never had but one Anatomy in the\r\ncountrey, which Mr. Giles Firman [Firmin] now in England, did make and\r\nread upon very well, but no more of that now.”\r\n\r\nSince the time of the Apostle Eliot the Lord has stirred up the hearts\r\nof our people to the building of many Schools and Colleges where\r\nmedicine is taught in all its branches. Mr. Giles Firmin's “Anatomy” may\r\nbe considered the first ancestor of a long line of skeletons which have\r\nbeen dangling and rattling in our lecture-rooms for more than a century.\r\n\r\nTeaching in New England in 1647 was a grave but simple matter. A single\r\nperson, combining in many cases, as in that of Mr. Giles Firmin,\r\nthe offices of physician and preacher, taught what he knew to a few\r\ndisciples whom he gathered about him. Of the making of that “Anatomy” on\r\nwhich my first predecessor in the branch I teach “did read very well”\r\n we can know nothing. The body of some poor wretch who had swung upon the\r\ngallows, was probably conveyed by night to some lonely dwelling at the\r\noutskirts of the village, and there by the light of flaring torches\r\nhastily dissected by hands that trembled over the unwonted task.\r\nAnd ever and anon the master turned to his book, as he laid bare the\r\nmysteries of the hidden organs; to his precious Vesalius, it might be,\r\nor his figures repeated in the multifarious volume of Ambroise Pare; to\r\nthe Aldine octavo in which Fallopius recorded his fresh observations; or\r\nthat giant folio of Spigelius just issued from the press of Amsterdam,\r\nin which lovely ladies display their viscera with a coquettish grace\r\nimplying that it is rather a pleasure than otherwise to show the\r\nlace-like omentum, and hold up their appendices epiploicae as if they\r\nwere saying “these are our jewels.”\r\n\r\nHis teaching of medicine was no doubt chiefly clinical, and received\r\nwith the same kind of faith as that which accepted his words from the\r\npulpit. His notions of disease were based on what he had observed, seen\r\nalways in the light of the traditional doctrines in which he was bred.\r\nHis discourse savored of the weighty doctrines of Hippocrates, diluted\r\nby the subtle speculations of Galen, reinforced by the curious comments\r\nof the Arabian schoolmen as they were conveyed in the mellifluous\r\nlanguage of Fernelius, blended, it may be, with something of the lofty\r\nmysticism of Van Helmont, and perhaps stealing a flavor of that earlier\r\nform of Homoeopathy which had lately come to light in Sir Kenelm Digby's\r\n“Discourse concerning the Cure of Wounds by the Sympathetic Powder.”\r\n\r\nHis Pathology was mythology. A malformed foetus, as the readers of\r\nWinthrop's Journal may remember, was enough to scare the colonists from\r\ntheir propriety, and suggest the gravest fears of portended disaster.\r\nThe student of the seventeenth century opened his Licetus and saw\r\nfigures of a lion with the head of a woman, and a man with the head of\r\nan elephant. He had offered to his gaze, as born of a human mother,\r\nthe effigy of a winged cherub, a pterocephalous specimen, which our\r\nProfessor of Pathological Anatomy would hardly know whether to treat\r\nwith the reverence due to its celestial aspect, or to imprison in one of\r\nhis immortalizing jars of alcohol.\r\n\r\nHis pharmacopoeia consisted mainly of simples, such as the venerable\r\n“Herball” of Gerard describes and figures in abounding affluence. St.\r\nJohn's wort and Clown's All-heal, with Spurge and Fennel, Saffron and\r\nParsley, Elder and Snake-root, with opium in some form, and roasted\r\nrhubarb and the Four Great Cold Seeds, and the two Resins, of which it\r\nused to be said that whatever the Tacamahaca has not cured, the Caranna\r\nwill, with the more familiar Scammony and Jalap and Black Hellebore,\r\nmade up a good part of his probable list of remedies. He would have\r\nordered Iron now and then, and possibly an occasional dose of Antimony.\r\nHe would perhaps have had a rheumatic patient wrapped in the skin of a\r\nwolf or a wild cat, and in case of a malignant fever with “purples” or\r\npetechiae, or of an obstinate king's evil, he might have prescribed\r\na certain black powder, which had been made by calcining toads in\r\nan earthen pot; a choice remedy, taken internally, or applied to any\r\noutward grief.\r\n\r\nExcept for the toad-powder and the peremptory drastics, one might have\r\nborne up against this herb doctoring as well as against some more modern\r\nstyles of medication. Barbeyrac and his scholar Sydenham had not yet\r\ncleansed the Pharmacopoeia of its perilous stuff, but there is no doubt\r\nthat the more sensible physicians of that day knew well enough that a\r\ngood honest herb-tea which amused the patient and his nurses was all\r\nthat was required to carry him through all common disorders.\r\n\r\nThe student soon learned the physiognomy of disease by going about with\r\nhis master; fevers, pleurisies, asthmas, dropsies, fluxes, small-pox,\r\nsore-throats, measles, consumptions. He saw what was done for them. He\r\nput up the medicines, gathered the herbs, and so learned something of\r\nmateria medico and botany. He learned these few things easily and well,\r\nfor he could give his whole attention to them. Chirurgery was a separate\r\nspecialty. Women in child-birth were cared for by midwives. There was\r\nno chemistry deserving the name to require his study. He did not learn a\r\ngreat deal, perhaps, but what he did learn was his business, namely, how\r\nto take care of sick people.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a picture of the old-fashioned way of instruction, by\r\ncarrying you with me in imagination in the company of worthy Master\r\nGiles Firmin as he makes his round of visits among the good folk of\r\nIpswich, followed by his one student, who shall answer to the scriptural\r\nname of Luke. It will not be for entertainment chiefly, but to\r\nillustrate the one mode of teaching which can never be superseded,\r\nand which, I venture to say, is more important than all the rest put\r\ntogether. The student is a green hand, as you will perceive.\r\n\r\nIn the first dwelling they come to, a stout fellow is bellowing with\r\ncolic.\r\n\r\n“He will die, Master, of a surety, methinks,” says the timid youth in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n“Nay, Luke,” the Master answers, “'t is but a dry belly-ache. Didst\r\nthou not mark that he stayed his roaring when I did press hard over the\r\nlesser bowels? Note that he hath not the pulse of them with fevers, and\r\nby what Dorcas telleth me there hath been no long shutting up of the\r\nvice naturales. We will steep certain comforting herbs which I will shew\r\nthee, and put them in a bag and lay them on his belly. Likewise he shall\r\nhave my cordial julep with a portion of this confection which we do call\r\nTheriaca Andromachi, which hath juice of poppy in it, and is a great\r\nstayer of anguish. This fellow is at his prayers to-day, but I warrant\r\nthee he shall be swearing with the best of them to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThey jog along the bridle-path on their horses until they come to\r\nanother lowly dwelling. They sit a while with a delicate looking girl\r\nin whom the ingenuous youth naturally takes a special interest. The good\r\nphysician talks cheerfully with her, asks her a few questions. Then to\r\nher mother: “Good-wife, Margaret hath somewhat profited, as she telleth,\r\nby the goat's milk she hath taken night and morning. Do thou pluck a\r\nmaniple--that is an handful--of the plant called Maidenhair, and make\r\na syrup therewith as I have shewed thee. Let her take a cup full of\r\nthe same, fasting, before she sleepeth, also before she riseth from her\r\nbed.” And so they leave the house.\r\n\r\n“What thinkest thou, Luke, of the maid we have been visiting?” “She\r\nseemeth not much ailing, Master, according to my poor judgment. For she\r\ndid say she was better. And she had a red cheek and a bright eye, and\r\nshe spake of being soon able to walk unto the meeting, and did seem\r\ngreatly hopeful, but spare of flesh, methought, and her voice something\r\nhoarse, as of one that hath a defluxion, with some small coughing from\r\na cold, as she did say. Speak I not truly, Master, that she will be well\r\nspeedily?”\r\n\r\n“Yea, Luke, I do think she shall be well, and mayhap speedily. But it is\r\nnot here with us she shall be well. For that redness of the cheek is\r\nbut the sign of the fever which, after the Grecians, we do call the\r\nhectical; and that shining of the eyes is but a sickly glazing, and they\r\nwhich do every day get better and likewise thinner and weaker shall find\r\nthat way leadeth to the church-yard gate. This is the malady which the\r\nancients did call tubes, or the wasting disease, and some do name the\r\nconsumption. A disease whereof most that fall ailing do perish. This\r\nMargaret is not long for earth--but she knoweth it not, and still\r\nhopeth.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then, Master, didst thou give her of thy medicine, seeing that her\r\nail is unto death?”\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt learn, boy, that they which are sick must have somewhat\r\nwherewith to busy their thoughts. There be some who do give these tabid\r\nor consumptives a certain posset made with lime-water and anise and\r\nliquorice and raisins of the sun, and there be other some who do give\r\nthe juice of craw-fishes boiled in barley-water with chicken-broth,\r\nbut these be toys, as I do think, and ye shall find as good virtue, nay\r\nbetter, in this syrup of the simple called Maidenhair.”\r\n\r\nSomething after this manner might Master Giles Firmin have delivered his\r\nclinical instructions. Somewhat in this way, a century and a half later,\r\nanother New England physician, Dr. Edward Augustus Holyoke, taught a\r\nyoung man who came to study with him, a very diligent and intelligent\r\nyouth, James Jackson by name, the same whose portrait in his advanced\r\nyears hangs upon this wall, long the honored Professor of Theory and\r\nPractice in this Institution, of whom I shall say something in this\r\nLecture. Our venerated Teacher studied assiduously afterwards in the\r\ngreat London Hospitals, but I think he used to quote his “old Master”\r\n ten times where he quoted Mr. Cline or Dr. Woodville once.\r\n\r\nWhen I compare this direct transfer of the practical experience of a\r\nwise man into the mind of a student,--every fact one that he can use\r\nin the battle of life and death,--with the far off, unserviceable\r\n“scientific” truths that I and some others are in the habit of teaching,\r\nI cannot help asking myself whether, if we concede that our forefathers\r\ntaught too little, there is not--a possibility that we may sometimes\r\nattempt to teach too much. I almost blush when I think of myself as\r\ndescribing the eight several facets on two slender processes of the\r\npalate bone, or the seven little twigs that branch off from the minute\r\ntympanic nerve, and I wonder whether my excellent colleague feels in the\r\nsame way when he pictures himself as giving the constitution of\r\nneurin, which as he and I know very well is that of the hydrate of\r\ntrimethyle-oxethyle-ammonium, or the formula for the production of\r\nalloxan, which, though none but the Professors and older students can\r\nbe expected to remember it, is C10 H4 N4 O6+ 2HO, NO5=C8 H4 N2\r\nO10+2CO2+N2+NH4 O, NO5.\r\n\r\nI can bear the voice of some rough iconoclast addressing the Anatomist\r\nand the Chemist in tones of contemptuous indignation: “What is this\r\nstuff with which you are cramming the brains of young men who are to\r\nhold the lives of the community in their hands? Here is a man fallen in\r\na fit; you can tell me all about the eight surfaces of the two processes\r\nof the palate bone, but you have not had the sense to loosen that man's\r\nneck-cloth, and the old women are all calling you a fool? Here is a\r\nfellow that has just swallowed poison. I want something to turn his\r\nstomach inside out at the shortest notice. Oh, you have forgotten the\r\ndose of the sulphate of zinc, but you remember the formula for the\r\nproduction of alloxan!”\r\n\r\n“Look you, Master Doctor,--if I go to a carpenter to come and stop\r\na leak in my roof that is flooding the house, do you suppose I care\r\nwhether he is a botanist or not? Cannot a man work in wood without\r\nknowing all about endogens and exogens, or must he attend Professor\r\nGray's Lectures before he can be trusted to make a box-trap? If my horse\r\ncasts a shoe, do you think I will not trust a blacksmith to shoe him\r\nuntil I have made sure that he is sound on the distinction between the\r\nsesquioxide and the protosesquioxide of iron?”\r\n\r\n--But my scientific labor is to lead to useful results by and by, in the\r\nnext generation, or in some possible remote future.--\r\n\r\n“Diavolo!” as your Dr. Rabelais has it,--answers the iconoclast,--“what\r\nis that to me and my colic, to me and my strangury? I pay the Captain of\r\nthe Cunard steamship to carry me quickly and safely to Liverpool, not\r\nto make a chart of the Atlantic for after voyagers! If Professor Peirce\r\nundertakes to pilot me into Boston Harbor and runs me on Cohasset rocks,\r\nwhat answer is it to tell me that he is Superintendent of the Coast\r\nSurvey? No, Sir! I want a plain man in a pea-jacket and a sou'wester,\r\nwho knows the channel of Boston Harbor, and the rocks of Boston Harbor,\r\nand the distinguished Professor is quite of my mind as to the matter,\r\nfor I took the pains to ask him before I ventured to use his name in the\r\nway of illustration.”\r\n\r\nI do not know how the remarks of the image-breaker may strike others,\r\nbut I feel that they put me on my defence with regard to much of my\r\nteaching. Some years ago I ventured to show in an introductory Lecture\r\nhow very small a proportion of the anatomical facts taught in a regular\r\ncourse, as delivered by myself and others, had any practical bearing\r\nwhatever on the treatment of disease. How can I, how can any medical\r\nteacher justify himself in teaching anything that is not like to be of\r\npractical use to a class of young men who are to hold in their hands\r\nthe balance in which life and death, ease and anguish, happiness and\r\nwretchedness are to be daily weighed?\r\n\r\nI hope we are not all wrong. Oftentimes in finding how sadly ignorant\r\nof really essential and vital facts and rules were some of those whom\r\nwe had been larding with the choicest scraps of science, I have doubted\r\nwhether the old one-man system of teaching, when the one man was of the\r\nright sort, did not turn out better working physicians than our more\r\nelaborate method. The best practitioner I ever knew was mainly shaped\r\nto excellence in that way. I can understand perfectly the regrets of my\r\nfriend Dr. John Brown of Edinburgh, for the good that was lost with the\r\nold apprenticeship system. I understand as well Dr. Latham's fear “that\r\nmany men of the best abilities and good education will be deterred from\r\nprosecuting physic as a profession, in consequence of the necessity\r\nindiscriminately laid upon all for impossible attainments.”\r\n\r\nI feel therefore impelled to say a very few words in defence of\r\nthat system of teaching adopted in our Colleges, by which we wish to\r\nsupplement and complete the instruction given by private individuals or\r\nby what are often called Summer Schools.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we teach so much that is not practical and in itself\r\nuseful, is because we find that the easiest way of teaching what is\r\npractical and useful. If we could in any way eliminate all that would\r\nhelp a man to deal successfully with disease, and teach it by itself\r\nso that it should be as tenaciously rooted in the memory, as easily\r\nsummoned when wanted, as fertile in suggestion of related facts, as\r\nsatisfactory to the peremptory demands of the intelligence as if taught\r\nin its scientific connections, I think it would be our duty so to teach\r\nthe momentous truths of medicine, and to regard all useless additions as\r\nan intrusion on the time which should be otherwise occupied.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot successfully eliminate and teach by itself that which is\r\npurely practical. The easiest and surest way of acquiring facts is to\r\nlearn them in groups, in systems, and systematized knowledge is science.\r\nYou can very often carry two facts fastened together more easily than\r\none by itself, as a housemaid can carry two pails of water with a hoop\r\nmore easily than one without it. You can remember a man's face, made\r\nup of many features, better than you can his nose or his mouth or his\r\neye-brow. Scores of proverbs show you that you can remember two lines\r\nthat rhyme better than one without the jingle. The ancients, who knew\r\nthe laws of memory, grouped the seven cities that contended for the\r\nhonor of being Homer's birthplace in a line thus given by Aulus Gellius:\r\n\r\nSmurna, Rodos, Colophon, Salamin, Ios, Argos, Athenai.\r\n\r\nI remember, in the earlier political days of Martin Van Buren,\r\nthat Colonel Stone, of the “New York Commercial,” or one of his\r\ncorrespondents, said that six towns of New York would claim in the same\r\nway to have been the birth-place of the “Little Magician,” as he was\r\nthen called; and thus he gave their names, any one of which I should\r\nlong ago have forgotten, but which as a group have stuck tight in my\r\nmemory from that day to this;\r\n\r\nCatskill, Saugerties, Redhook, Kinderhook, Scaghticoke, Schodac.\r\n\r\nIf the memory gains so much by mere rhythmical association, how much\r\nmore will it gain when isolated facts are brought together under laws\r\nand principles, when organs are examined in their natural connections,\r\nwhen structure is coupled with function, and healthy and diseased action\r\nare studied as they pass one into the other! Systematic, or scientific\r\nstudy is invaluable as supplying a natural kind of mnemonics, if for\r\nnothing else. You cannot properly learn the facts you want from Anatomy\r\nand Chemistry in any way so easily as by taking them in their regular\r\norder, with other allied facts, only there must be common sense\r\nexercised in leaving out a great deal which belongs to each of the two\r\nbranches as pure science. The dullest of teachers is the one who does\r\nnot know what to omit.\r\n\r\nThe larger aim of scientific training is to furnish you with principles\r\nto which you will be able to refer isolated facts, and so bring these\r\nwithin the range of recorded experience. See what the “London Times”\r\n said about the three Germans who cracked open John Bull Chatwood's\r\nstrong-box at the Fair the other day, while the three Englishmen\r\nhammered away in vain at Brother Jonathan Herring's. The Englishmen\r\nrepresented brute force. The Germans had been trained to appreciate\r\nprinciple. The Englishman “knows his business by rote and rule of\r\nthumb”--science, which would “teach him to do in an hour what has\r\nhitherto occupied him two hours,” “is in a manner forbidden to him.” To\r\nthis cause the “Times” attributes the falling off of English workmen in\r\ncomparison with those of the Continent.\r\n\r\nGranting all this, we must not expect too much from “science”\r\n as distinguished from common experience. There are ten thousand\r\nexperimenters without special apparatus for every one in the laboratory.\r\nAccident is the great chemist and toxicologist. Battle is the great\r\nvivisector. Hunger has instituted researches on food such as no Liebig,\r\nno Academic Commission has ever recorded.\r\n\r\nMedicine, sometimes impertinently, often ignorantly, often carelessly\r\ncalled “allopathy,” appropriates everything from every source that can\r\nbe of the slightest use to anybody who is ailing in any way, or like to\r\nbe ailing from any cause. It learned from a monk how to use antimony,\r\nfrom a Jesuit how to cure agues, from a friar how to cut for stone, from\r\na soldier how to treat gout, from a sailor how to keep off scurvy, from\r\na postmaster how to sound the Eustachian tube, from a dairy-maid how\r\nto prevent small-pox, and from an old market-woman how to catch the\r\nitch-insect. It borrowed acupuncture and the moxa from the Japanese\r\nheathen, and was taught the use of lobelia by the American savage.\r\nIt stands ready to-day to accept anything from any theorist, from any\r\nempiric who can make out a good case for his discovery or his remedy.\r\n“Science” is one of its benefactors, but only one, out of many. Ask the\r\nwisest practising physician you know, what branches of science help\r\nhim habitually, and what amount of knowledge relating to each branch he\r\nrequires for his professional duties. He will tell you that scientific\r\ntraining has a value independent of all the special knowledge acquired.\r\nHe will tell you that many facts are explained by studying them in the\r\nwider range of related facts to which they belong. He will gratefully\r\nrecognize that the anatomist has furnished him with indispensable data,\r\nthat the physiologist has sometimes put him on the track of new modes\r\nof treatment, that the chemist has isolated the active principles of\r\nhis medicines, has taught him how to combine them, has from time to time\r\noffered him new remedial agencies, and so of others of his allies. But\r\nhe will also tell you, if I am not mistaken, that his own branch of\r\nknowledge is so extensive and so perplexing that he must accept most\r\nof his facts ready made at their hands. He will own to you that in the\r\nstruggle for life which goes on day and night in our thoughts as in the\r\noutside world of nature, much that he learned under the name of science\r\nhas died out, and that simple homely experience has largely taken the\r\nplace of that scholastic knowledge to which he and perhaps some of his\r\ninstructors once attached a paramount importance.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is my view of scientific training as conducted in courses\r\nsuch as you are entering on. Up to a certain point I believe in set\r\nLectures as excellent adjuncts to what is far more important, practical\r\ninstruction at the bedside, in the operating room, and under the eye of\r\nthe Demonstrator. But I am so far from wishing these courses extended,\r\nthat I think some of them--suppose I say my own--would almost bear\r\ncurtailing. Do you want me to describe more branches of the sciatic and\r\ncrural nerves? I can take Fischer's plates, and lecturing on that scale\r\nfill up my whole course and not finish the nerves alone. We must stop\r\nsomewhere, and for my own part I think the scholastic exercises of our\r\ncolleges have already claimed their full share of the student's time\r\nwithout our seeking to extend them.\r\n\r\nI trust I have vindicated the apparent inconsequence of teaching young\r\nstudents a good deal that seems at first sight profitless, but which\r\nhelps them to learn and retain what is profitable. But this is an\r\ninquisitive age, and if we insist on piling up beyond a certain height\r\nknowledge which is in itself mere trash and lumber to a man whose life\r\nis to be one long fight with death and disease, there will be some sharp\r\nquestions asked by and by, and our quick-witted people will perhaps find\r\nthey can get along as well without the professor's cap as without the\r\nbishop's mitre and the monarch's crown.\r\n\r\nI myself have nothing to do with clinical teaching. Yet I do not\r\nhesitate to say it is more essential than all the rest put together, so\r\nfar as the ordinary practice of medicine is concerned; and this is by\r\nfar the most important thing to be learned, because it deals with so\r\nmany more lives than any other branch of the profession. So of personal\r\ninstruction, such as we give and others give in the interval of\r\nlectures, much of it at the bedside, some of it in the laboratory, some\r\nin the microscope-room, some in the recitation-room, I think it has many\r\nadvantages of its own over the winter course, and I do not wish to see\r\nit shortened for the sake of prolonging what seems to me long enough\r\nalready.\r\n\r\nIf I am jealous of the tendency to expand the time given to the\r\nacquisition of curious knowledge, at the expense of the plain\r\nold-fashioned bedside teachings, I only share the feeling which Sydenham\r\nexpressed two hundred years ago, using an image I have already borrowed.\r\n“He would be no honest and successful pilot who was to apply himself\r\nwith less industry to avoid rocks and sands and bring his vessel safely\r\nhome, than to search into the causes of the ebbing and flowing of the\r\nsea, which, though very well for a philosopher, is foreign to him whose\r\nbusiness it is to secure the ship. So neither will a physician, whose\r\nprovince it is to cure diseases, be able to do so, though he be a person\r\nof great genius, who bestows less time on the hidden and intricate\r\nmethod of nature, and adapting his means thereto, than on curious and\r\nsubtle speculation.”\r\n\r\n“Medicine is my wife and Science is my mistress,” said Dr. Rush. I do\r\nnot think that the breach of the seventh commandment can be shown to\r\nhave been of advantage to the legitimate owner of his affections. Read\r\nwhat Dr. Elisha Bartlett says of him as a practitioner, or ask one of\r\nour own honored ex-professors, who studied under him, whether Dr. Rush\r\nhad ever learned the meaning of that saying of Lord Bacon, that man\r\nis the minister and interpreter of Nature, or whether he did not speak\r\nhabitually of Nature as an intruder in the sick room, from which his art\r\nwas to expel her as an incompetent and a meddler.\r\n\r\nAll a man's powers are not too much for such a profession as Medicine.\r\n“He is a learned man,” said old Parson Emmons of Franklin, “who\r\nunderstands one subject, and he is a very learned man who understands\r\ntwo subjects.” Schonbein says he has been studying oxygen for thirty\r\nyears. Mitscherlich said it took fourteen years to establish a new fact\r\nin chemistry. Aubrey says of Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation,\r\nthat “though all his profession would allow him to be an excellent\r\nanatomist, I have never heard of any who admired his therapeutic\r\nway.” My learned and excellent friend before referred to, Dr. Brown\r\nof Edinburgh, from whose very lively and sensible Essay, “Locke and\r\nSydenham,” I have borrowed several of my citations, contrasts Sir\r\nCharles Bell, the discoverer, the man of science, with Dr. Abercrombie,\r\nthe master in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. It is through one\r\nof the rarest of combinations that we have in our Faculty a teacher\r\non whom the scientific mantle of Bell has fallen, and who yet stands\r\npreeminent in the practical treatment of the class of diseases which\r\nhis inventive and ardent experimental genius has illustrated. M.\r\nBrown-Sequard's example is as eloquent as his teaching in proof of the\r\nadvantages of well directed scientific investigation. But those who\r\nemulate his success at once as a discoverer and a practitioner must be\r\ncontent like him to limit their field of practice. The highest genius\r\ncannot afford in our time to forget the ancient precept, Divide et\r\nimpera.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I must go and earn this guinea,” said a medical man who was\r\nsent for while he was dissecting an animal. I should not have cared to\r\nbe his patient. His dissection would do me no good, and his thoughts\r\nwould be too much upon it. I want a whole man for my doctor, not a half\r\none. I would have sent for a humbler practitioner, who would have given\r\nhimself entirely to me, and told the other--who was no less a man than\r\nJohn Hunter--to go on and finish the dissection of his tiger.\r\n\r\nSydenham's “Read Don Quixote” should be addressed not to the student,\r\nbut to the Professor of today. Aimed at him it means, “Do not be too\r\nlearned.”\r\n\r\nDo not think you are going to lecture to picked young men who are\r\ntraining themselves to be scientific discoverers. They are of fair\r\naverage capacity, and they are going to be working doctors.\r\n\r\nThese young men are to have some very serious vital facts to deal with.\r\nI will mention a few of them.\r\n\r\nEvery other resident adult you meet in these streets is or will be more\r\nor less tuberculous. This is not an extravagant estimate, as very\r\nnearly one third of the deaths of adults in Boston last year were from\r\nphthisis. If the relative number is less in our other northern cities,\r\nit is probably in a great measure because they are more unhealthy; that\r\nis, they have as much, or nearly as much, consumption, but they have\r\nmore fevers or other fatal diseases.\r\n\r\nThese heavy-eyed men with the alcoholized brains, these pallid youths\r\nwith the nicotized optic ganglia and thinking-marrows brown as their\r\nown meerschaums, of whom you meet too many,--will ask all your wisdom to\r\ndeal with their poisoned nerves and their enfeebled wills.\r\n\r\nNearly seventeen hundred children under five years of age died last\r\nyear in this city. A poor human article, no doubt, in many cases, still,\r\nworth an attempt to save them, especially when we remember the effect\r\nof Dr. Clarke's suggestion at the Dublin Hospital, by which some\r\ntwenty-five or thirty thousand children's lives have probably been saved\r\nin a single city.\r\n\r\nAgain, the complaint is often heard that the native population is not\r\nincreasing so rapidly as in former generations. The breeding and nursing\r\nperiod of American women is one of peculiar delicacy and frequent\r\ninfirmity. Many of them must require a considerable interval between the\r\nreproductive efforts, to repair damages and regain strength. This matter\r\nis not to be decided by an appeal to unschooled nature. It is the same\r\nquestion as that of the deformed pelvis,--one of degree. The facts\r\nof mal-vitalization are as much to be attended to as those of\r\nmal-formation. If the woman with a twisted pelvis is to be considered an\r\nexempt, the woman with a defective organization should be recognized as\r\nbelonging to the invalid corps. We shudder to hear what is alleged as\r\nto the prevalence of criminal practices; if back of these there can be\r\nshown organic incapacity or overtaxing of too limited powers, the facts\r\nbelong to the province of the practical physician, as well as of the\r\nmoralist and the legislator, and require his gravest consideration.\r\n\r\nTake the important question of bleeding. Is venesection done with\r\nforever? Six years ago it was said here in an introductory Lecture that\r\nit would doubtless come back again sooner or later. A fortnight ago\r\nI found myself in the cars with one of the most sensible and esteemed\r\npractitioners in New England. He took out his wallet and showed me two\r\nlancets, which he carried with him; he had never given up their use.\r\nThis is a point you will have to consider.\r\n\r\nOr, to mention one out of many questionable remedies, shall you give\r\nVeratrum Viride in fevers and inflammations? It makes the pulse slower\r\nin these affections. Then the presumption would naturally be that it\r\ndoes harm. The caution with reference to it on this ground was long\r\nago recorded in the Lecture above referred to. See what Dr. John Hughes\r\nBennett says of it in the recent edition of his work on Medicine.\r\nNothing but the most careful clinical experience can settle this and\r\nsuch points of treatment.\r\n\r\nThese are all practical questions--questions of life and death, and\r\nevery day will be full of just such questions. Take the problem of\r\nclimate. A patient comes to you with asthma and wants to know where he\r\ncan breathe; another comes to you with phthisis and wants to know where\r\nhe can live. What boy's play is nine tenths of all that is taught in\r\nmany a pretentious course of lectures, compared with what an accurate\r\nand extensive knowledge of the advantages and disadvantages of different\r\nresidences in these and other complaints would be to a practising\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nI saw the other day a gentleman living in Canada, who had spent seven\r\nsuccessive winters in Egypt, with the entire relief of certain obscure\r\nthoracic symptoms which troubled him while at home. I saw, two months\r\nago, another gentleman from Minnesota, an observer and a man of sense,\r\nwho considered that State as the great sanatorium for all pulmonary\r\ncomplaints. If half our grown population are or will be more or less\r\ntuberculous, the question of colonizing Florida assumes a new aspect.\r\nEven within the borders of our own State, the very interesting\r\nresearches of Dr. Bowditch show that there is a great variation in the\r\namount of tuberculous disease in different towns, apparently connected\r\nwith local conditions. The hygienic map of a State is quite as valuable\r\nas its geological map, and it is the business of every practising\r\nphysician to know it thoroughly. They understand this in England, and\r\nsend a patient with a dry irritating cough to Torquay or Penzance,\r\nwhile they send another with relaxed bronchial membranes to Clifton or\r\nBrighton. Here is another great field for practical study.\r\n\r\nSo as to the all-important question of diet. “Of all the means of cure\r\nat our command,” says Dr. Bennett, “a regulation of the quantity and\r\nquality of the diet is by far the most powerful.” Dr. MacCormac would\r\nperhaps except the air we breathe, for he thinks that impure air,\r\nespecially in sleeping rooms, is the great cause of tubercle. It\r\nis sufficiently proved that the American,--the New Englander,--the\r\nBostonian, can breed strong and sound children, generation after\r\ngeneration,--nay, I have shown by the record of a particular family that\r\nvital losses may be retrieved, and a feeble race grow to lusty vigor in\r\nthis very climate and locality. Is not the question why our young men\r\nand women so often break down, and how they can be kept from breaking\r\ndown, far more important for physicians to settle than whether there is\r\none cranial vertebra, or whether there are four, or none?\r\n\r\n--But I have a taste for the homologies, I want to go deeply into the\r\nsubject of embryology, I want to analyze the protonihilates precipitated\r\nfrom pigeon's milk by the action of the lunar spectrum,--shall I not\r\nfollow my star,--shall I not obey my instinct,--shall I not give myself\r\nto the lofty pursuits of science for its own sake?\r\n\r\nCertainly you may, if you like. But take down your sign, or never put\r\nit up. That is the way Dr. Owen and Dr. Huxley, Dr. Agassiz and\r\nDr. Jeffries Wyman, Dr. Gray and Dr. Charles T. Jackson settled the\r\ndifficulty. We all admire the achievements of this band of distinguished\r\ndoctors who do not practise. But we say of their work and of all pure\r\nscience, as the French officer said of the charge of the six hundred at\r\nBalaclava, “C'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre,”--it is very\r\nsplendid, but it is not a practising doctor's business. His patient has\r\na right to the cream of his life and not merely to the thin milk that is\r\nleft after “science” has skimmed it off. The best a physician can give\r\nis never too good for the patient.\r\n\r\nIt is often a disadvantage to a young practitioner to be known for any\r\naccomplishment outside of his profession. Haller lost his election as\r\nPhysician to the Hospital in his native city of Berne, principally on\r\nthe ground that he was a poet. In his later years the physician may\r\nventure more boldly. Astruc was sixty-nine years old when he published\r\nhis “Conjectures,” the first attempt, we are told, to decide the\r\nauthorship of the Pentateuch showing anything like a discerning\r\ncriticism. Sir Benjamin Brodie was seventy years old before he left\r\nhis physiological and surgical studies to indulge in psychological\r\nspeculations. The period of pupilage will be busy enough in acquiring\r\nthe knowledge needed, and the season of active practice will leave\r\nlittle leisure for any but professional studies.\r\n\r\nDr. Graves of Dublin, one of the first clinical teachers of our\r\ntime, always insisted on his students' beginning at once to visit the\r\nhospital. At the bedside the student must learn to treat disease, and\r\njust as certainly as we spin out and multiply our academic prelections\r\nwe shall work in more and more stuffing, more and more rubbish, more and\r\nmore irrelevant, useless detail which the student will get rid of just\r\nas soon as he leaves us. Then the next thing will be a new organization,\r\nwith an examining board of first-rate practical men, who will ask the\r\ncandidate questions that mean business,--who will make him operate if\r\nhe is to be a surgeon, and try him at the bedside if he is to be a\r\nphysician,--and not puzzle him with scientific conundrums which not more\r\nthan one of the questioners could answer himself or ever heard of since\r\nhe graduated.\r\n\r\nOr these women who are hammering at the gates on which is written “No\r\nadmittance for the mothers of mankind,” will by and by organize an\r\ninstitution, which starting from that skilful kind of nursing which\r\nFlorence Nightingale taught so well, will work backwards through\r\nanodynes, palliatives, curatives, preventives, until with little show\r\nof science it imparts most of what is most valuable in those branches of\r\nthe healing art it professes to teach. When that time comes, the fitness\r\nof women for certain medical duties, which Hecquet advocated in 1708,\r\nwhich Douglas maintained in 1736, which Dr. John Ware, long the honored\r\nProfessor of Theory and Practice in this Institution, upheld within\r\nour own recollection in the face of his own recorded opinion to the\r\ncontrary, will very possibly be recognized.\r\n\r\nMy advice to every teacher less experienced than myself would be,\r\ntherefore: Do not fret over the details you have to omit; you probably\r\nteach altogether too many as it is. Individuals may learn a thing\r\nwith once hearing it, but the only way of teaching a whole class is by\r\nenormous repetition, representation, and illustration in all possible\r\nforms. Now and then you will have a young man on your benches like the\r\nlate Waldo Burnett,--not very often, if you lecture half a century. You\r\ncannot pretend to lecture chiefly for men like that,--a Mississippi raft\r\nmight as well take an ocean-steamer in tow. To meet his wants you would\r\nhave to leave the rest of your class behind and that you must not do.\r\nPresident Allen of Jefferson College says that his instruction has\r\nbeen successful in proportion as it has been elementary. It may be a\r\nhumiliating statement, but it is one which I have found true in my own\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nTo the student I would say, that however plain and simple may be our\r\nteaching, he must expect to forget much which he follows intelligently\r\nin the lecture-room. But it is not the same as if he had never learned\r\nit. A man must get a thing before he can forget it. There is a great\r\nworld of ideas we cannot voluntarily recall,--they are outside the\r\nlimits of the will. But they sway our conscious thought as the unseen\r\nplanets influence the movements of those within the sphere of vision. No\r\nman knows how much he knows,--how many ideas he has,--any more than\r\nhe knows how many blood-globules roll in his veins. Sometimes accident\r\nbrings back here and there one, but the mind is full of irrevocable\r\nremembrances and unthinkable thoughts, which take a part in all\r\nits judgments as indestructible forces. Some of you must feel your\r\nscientific deficiencies painfully after your best efforts. But every one\r\ncan acquire what is most essential. A man of very moderate ability may\r\nbe a good physician, if he devotes himself faithfully to the work. More\r\nthan this, a positively dull man, in the ordinary acceptation of the\r\nterm, sometimes makes a safer practitioner than one who has, we will\r\nsay, five per cent. more brains than his average neighbor, but who\r\nthinks it is fifty per cent. more. Skulls belonging to this last variety\r\nof the human race are more common, I may remark, than specimens like the\r\nNeanderthal cranium, a cast of which you will find on the table in the\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nWhether the average talent be high or low, the Colleges of the land must\r\nmake the best commodity they can out of such material as the country and\r\nthe cities furnish them. The community must have Doctors as it must\r\nhave bread. It uses up its Doctors just as it wears out its shoes, and\r\nrequires new ones. All the bread need not be French rolls, all the shoes\r\nneed not be patent leather ones; but the bread must be something that\r\ncan be eaten, and the shoes must be something that can be worn. Life\r\nmust somehow find food for the two forces that rub everything to\r\npieces, or burn it to ashes,--friction and oxygen. Doctors are oxydable\r\nproducts, and the schools must keep furnishing new ones as the old\r\nones turn into oxyds; some of first-rate quality that burn with a great\r\nlight, some of a lower grade of brilliancy, some honestly, unmistakably,\r\nby the grace of God, of moderate gifts, or in simpler phrase, dull.\r\n\r\nThe public will give every honest and reasonably competent worker in\r\nthe healing art a hearty welcome. It is on the whole very loyal to the\r\nMedical Profession. Three successive years have borne witness to the\r\nfeeling with which this Institution, representing it in its educational\r\naspect, is regarded by those who are themselves most honored and\r\nesteemed. The great Master of Natural Science bade the last year's class\r\nfarewell in our behalf, in those accents which delight every audience.\r\nThe Head of our ancient University honored us in the same way in the\r\npreceding season. And how can we forget that other occasion when the\r\nChief Magistrate of the Commonwealth, that noble citizen whom we have\r\njust lost, large-souled, sweet-natured, always ready for every kind\r\noffice, came among us at our bidding, and talked to us of our duties in\r\nwords as full of wisdom as his heart was of goodness?\r\n\r\nYou have not much to fear, I think, from the fancy practitioners. The\r\nvulgar quackeries drop off, atrophied, one after another. Homoeopathy\r\nhas long been encysted, and is carried on the body medical as quietly as\r\nan old wen. Every year gives you a more reasoning and reasonable people\r\nto deal with. See how it is in Literature. The dynasty of British\r\ndogmatists, after lasting a hundred years and more, is on its last legs.\r\nThomas Carlyle, third in the line of descent, finds an audience very\r\ndifferent from those which listened to the silver speech of Samuel\r\nTaylor Coleridge and the sonorous phrases of Samuel Johnson. We\r\nread him, we smile at his clotted English, his “swarmery” and other\r\npicturesque expressions, but we lay down his tirade as we do one of Dr.\r\nCumming's interpretations of prophecy, which tells us that the world is\r\ncoming to an end next week or next month, if the weather permits,--not\r\notherwise,--feeling very sure that the weather will be unfavorable.\r\n\r\nIt is the same common-sense public you will appeal to. The less\r\npretension you make, the better they will like you in the long run. I\r\nhope we shall make everything as plain and as simple to you as we can.\r\nI would never use a long word, even, where a short one would answer\r\nthe purpose. I know there are professors in this country who “ligate”\r\n arteries. Other surgeons only tie them, and it stops the bleeding just\r\nas well. It is the familiarity and simplicity of bedside instruction\r\nwhich makes it so pleasant as well as so profitable. A good clinical\r\nteacher is himself a Medical School. We need not wonder that our young\r\nmen are beginning to announce themselves not only as graduates of this\r\nor that College, but also as pupils of some one distinguished master.\r\n\r\nI wish to close this Lecture, if you will allow me a few moments longer,\r\nwith a brief sketch of an instructor and practitioner whose character\r\nwas as nearly a model one in both capacities as I can find anywhere\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nDr. JAMES JACKSON, Professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine\r\nin this University from 1812 to 1846, and whose name has been since\r\nretained on our rolls as Professor Emeritus, died on the 27th of August\r\nlast, in the ninetieth year of his age. He studied his profession, as\r\nI have already mentioned, with Dr. Holyoke of Salem, one of the few\r\nphysicians who have borne witness to their knowledge of the laws of life\r\nby living to complete their hundredth year. I think the student took\r\nhis Old Master, as he always loved to call him, as his model; each was\r\nworthy of the other, and both were bright examples to all who come after\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI remember that in the sermon preached by Dr. Grazer after Dr. Holyoke's\r\ndeath, one of the points most insisted upon as characteristic of that\r\nwise and good old man was the perfect balance of all his faculties. The\r\nsame harmonious adjustment of powers, the same symmetrical arrangement\r\nof life, the same complete fulfilment of every day's duties, without\r\nhaste and without needless delay, which characterized the master,\r\nequally distinguished the scholar. A glance at the life of our own Old\r\nMaster, if I can do any justice at all to his excellences, will give\r\nyou something to carry away from this hour's meeting not unworthy to be\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nFrom December, 1797, to October, 1799, he remained with Dr. Holyoke as a\r\nstudent, a period which he has spoken of as a most interesting and\r\nmost gratifying part of his life. After this he passed eight months\r\nin London, and on his return, in October, 1800, he began business in\r\nBoston.\r\n\r\nHe had followed Mr. Cline, as I have mentioned, and was competent to\r\npractise Surgery. But he found Dr. John Collins Warren had already\r\noccupied the ground which at that day hardly called for more than\r\none leading practitioner, and wisely chose the Medical branch of the\r\nprofession. He had only himself to rely upon, but he had confidence in\r\nhis prospects, conscious, doubtless, of his own powers, knowing his\r\nown industry and determination, and being of an eminently cheerful and\r\nhopeful disposition. No better proof of his spirit can be given\r\nthan that, just a year from the time when he began to practise as a\r\nphysician, he took that eventful step which in such a man implies that\r\nhe sees his way clear to a position; he married a lady blessed with many\r\ngifts, but not bringing him a fortune to paralyze his industry.\r\n\r\nHe had not miscalculated his chances in life. He very soon rose into a\r\ngood practice, and began the founding of that reputation which grew with\r\nhis years, until he stood by general consent at the head of his chosen\r\nbranch of the profession, to say the least, in this city and in all this\r\nregion of country. His skill and wisdom were the last tribunal to which\r\nthe sick and suffering could appeal. The community trusted and loved\r\nhim, the profession recognized him as the noblest type of the physician.\r\nThe young men whom he had taught wandered through foreign hospitals;\r\nwhere they learned many things that were valuable, and many that were\r\ncurious; but as they grew older and began to think more of their ability\r\nto help the sick than their power of talking about phenomena, they began\r\nto look back to the teaching of Dr. Jackson, as he, after his London\r\nexperience, looked back to that of Dr. Holyoke. And so it came to be at\r\nlast that the bare mention of his name in any of our medical assemblies\r\nwould call forth such a tribute of affectionate regard as is only\r\nyielded to age when it brings with it the record of a life spent in well\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nNo accident ever carries a man to eminence such as his in the medical\r\nprofession. He who looks for it must want it earnestly and work for it\r\nvigorously; Nature must have qualified him in many ways, and education\r\nmust have equipped him with various knowledge, or his reputation will\r\nevaporate before it reaches the noon-day blaze of fame. How did Dr.\r\nJackson gain the position which all conceded to him? In the answer to\r\nthis question some among you may find a key that shall unlock the gate\r\nopening on that fair field of the future of which all dream but which\r\nnot all will ever reach.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he truly loved his profession. He had no intellectual\r\nambitions outside of it, literary, scientific or political. To him it\r\nwas occupation enough to apply at the bedside the best of all that he\r\nknew for the good of his patient; to protect the community against the\r\ninroads of pestilence; to teach the young all that he himself had been\r\ntaught, with all that his own experience had added; to leave on record\r\nsome of the most important results of his long observation.\r\n\r\nWith his patients he was so perfect at all points that it is hard to\r\noverpraise him. I have seen many noted British and French and American\r\npractitioners, but I never saw the man so altogether admirable at the\r\nbedside of the sick as Dr. James Jackson. His smile was itself a remedy\r\nbetter than the potable gold and the dissolved pearls that comforted the\r\npraecordia of mediaeval monarchs. Did a patient, alarmed without cause,\r\nneed encouragement, it carried the sunshine of hope into his heart and\r\nput all his whims to flight, as David's harp cleared the haunted chamber\r\nof the sullen king. Had the hour come, not for encouragement, but for\r\nsympathy, his face, his voice, his manner all showed it, because his\r\nheart felt it. So gentle was he, so thoughtful, so calm, so absorbed\r\nin the case before him, not to turn round and look for a tribute to his\r\nsagacity, not to bolster himself in a favorite theory, but to find out\r\nall he could, and to weigh gravely and cautiously all that he found,\r\nthat to follow him in his morning visit was not only to take a lesson in\r\nthe healing art, it was learning how to learn, how to move, how to look,\r\nhow to feel, if that can be learned. To visit with Dr. Jackson was a\r\nmedical education.\r\n\r\nHe was very firm, with all his kindness. He would have the truth about\r\nhis patients. The nurses found it out; and the shrewder ones never\r\nventured to tell him anything but a straight story. A clinical dialogue\r\nbetween Dr. Jackson and Miss Rebecca Taylor, sometime nurse in the\r\nMassachusetts General Hospital, a mistress in her calling, was as good\r\nquestioning and answering as one would be like to hear outside of the\r\ncourt-room.\r\n\r\nOf his practice you can form an opinion from his book called “Letters to\r\na Young Physician.” Like all sensible men from the days of Hippocrates\r\nto the present, he knew that diet and regimen were more important\r\nthan any drug or than all drugs put together. Witness his treatment of\r\nphthisis and of epilepsy. He retained, however, more confidence in some\r\nremedial agents than most of the younger generation would concede to\r\nthem. Yet his materia medica was a simple one.\r\n\r\n“When I first went to live with Dr. Holyoke,” he says, “in 1797, showing\r\nme his shop, he said, 'There seems to you to be a great variety of\r\nmedicines here, and that it will take you long to get acquainted with\r\nthem, but most of them are unimportant. There are four which are equal\r\nto all the rest, namely, Mercury, Antimony, Bark and Opium.'” And Dr.\r\nJackson adds, “I can only say of his practice, the longer I have lived,\r\nI have thought better and better of it.” When he thought it necessary to\r\ngive medicine, he gave it in earnest. He hated half-practice--giving\r\na little of this or that, so as to be able to say that one had done\r\nsomething, in case a consultation was held, or a still more ominous\r\nevent occurred. He would give opium, for instance, as boldly as the late\r\nDr. Fisher of Beverly, but he followed the aphorism of the Father of\r\nMedicine, and kept extreme remedies for extreme cases.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the “non-naturals,” as he would sometimes call them,\r\nafter the old physicians,--namely, air, meat and drink, sleep and\r\nwatching, motion and rest, the retentions and excretions, and the\r\naffections of the mind,--he was, as I have said, of the school of\r\nsensible practitioners, in distinction from that vast community of\r\nquacks, with or without the diploma, who think the chief end of man is\r\nto support apothecaries, and are never easy until they can get every\r\npatient upon a regular course of something nasty or noxious. Nobody\r\nwas so precise in his directions about diet, air, and exercise, as Dr.\r\nJackson. He had the same dislike to the a peu pres, the about so much,\r\nabout so often, about so long, which I afterwards found among the\r\npunctilious adherents of the numerical system at La Pitie.\r\n\r\nHe used to insist on one small point with a certain philological\r\nprecision, namely, the true meaning of the word “cure.” He would have\r\nit that to cure a patient was simply to care for him. I refer to it\r\nas showing what his idea was of the relation of the physician to the\r\npatient. It was indeed to care for him, as if his life were bound up\r\nin him, to watch his incomings and outgoings, to stand guard at every\r\navenue that disease might enter, to leave nothing to chance; not merely\r\nto throw a few pills and powders into one pan of the scales of Fate,\r\nwhile Death the skeleton was seated in the other, but to lean with his\r\nwhole weight on the side of life, and shift the balance in its favor\r\nif it lay in human power to do it. Such devotion as this is only to be\r\nlooked for in the man who gives himself wholly up to the business of\r\nhealing, who considers Medicine itself a Science, or if not a science,\r\nis willing to follow it as an art,--the noblest of arts, which the gods\r\nand demigods of ancient religions did not disdain to practise and to\r\nteach.\r\n\r\nThe same zeal made him always ready to listen to any new suggestion\r\nwhich promised to be useful, at a period of life when many men find\r\nit hard to learn new methods and accept new doctrines. Few of\r\nhis generation became so accomplished as he in the arts of direct\r\nexploration; coming straight from the Parisian experts, I have examined\r\nmany patients with him, and have had frequent opportunities of observing\r\nhis skill in percussion and auscultation.\r\n\r\nOne element in his success, a trivial one compared with others, but not\r\nto be despised, was his punctuality. He always carried two watches,--I\r\ndoubt if he told why, any more than Dr. Johnson told what he did with\r\nthe orange-peel,--but probably with reference to this virtue. He was as\r\nmuch to be depended upon at the appointed time as the solstice or\r\nthe equinox. There was another point I have heard him speak of as an\r\nimportant rule with him; to come at the hour when he was expected; if\r\nhe had made his visit for several days successively at ten o'clock, for\r\ninstance, not to put it off, if he could possibly help it, until eleven,\r\nand so keep a nervous patient and an anxious family waiting for him\r\nthrough a long, weary hour.\r\n\r\nIf I should attempt to characterize his teaching, I should say that\r\nwhile it conveyed the best results of his sagacious and extended\r\nobservation, it was singularly modest, cautious, simple, sincere.\r\nNothing was for show, for self-love; there was no rhetoric, no\r\ndeclamation, no triumphant “I told you so,” but the plain statement of\r\na clear-headed honest man, who knows that he is handling one of the\r\ngravest subjects that interest humanity. His positive instructions were\r\nfull of value, but the spirit in which he taught inspired that loyal\r\nlove of truth which lies at the bottom of all real excellence.\r\n\r\nI will not say that, during his long career, Dr. Jackson never made\r\nan enemy. I have heard him tell how, in his very early days, old Dr.\r\nDanforth got into a towering passion with him about some professional\r\nconsultation, and exploded a monosyllable or two of the more energetic\r\nkind on the occasion. I remember that that somewhat peculiar personage,\r\nDr. Waterhouse, took it hardly when Dr. Jackson succeeded to his place\r\nas Professor of Theory and Practice. A young man of Dr. Jackson's talent\r\nand energy could hardly take the position that belonged to him without\r\ncrowding somebody in a profession where three in a bed is the common\r\nrule of the household. But he was a peaceful man and a peace-maker all\r\nhis days. No man ever did more, if so much, to produce and maintain\r\nthe spirit of harmony for which we consider our medical community as\r\nsomewhat exceptionally distinguished.\r\n\r\nIf this harmony should ever be threatened, I could wish that every\r\nimpatient and irritable member of the profession would read that\r\nbeautiful, that noble Preface to the “Letters,” addressed to John\r\nCollins Warren. I know nothing finer in the medical literature of all\r\ntime than this Prefatory Introduction. It is a golden prelude, fit to\r\ngo with the three great Prefaces which challenge the admiration of\r\nscholars,--Calvin's to his Institutes, De Thou's to his History, and\r\nCasaubon's to his Polybius,--not because of any learning or rhetoric,\r\nthough it is charmingly written, but for a spirit flowing through it to\r\nwhich learning and rhetoric are but as the breath that is wasted on the\r\nair to the Mood that warms the heart.\r\n\r\nOf a similar character is this short extract which I am permitted\r\nto make from a private letter of his to a dear young friend. He was\r\neighty-three years old at the time of writing it.\r\n\r\n“I have not loved everybody whom I have known, but I have striven to see\r\nthe good points in the characters of all men and women. At first I must\r\nhave done this from something in my own nature, for I was not aware of\r\nit, and yet was doing it without any plan, when one day, sixty years\r\nago, a friend whom I loved and respected said this to me, 'Ah, James, I\r\nsee that you are destined to succeed in the world, and to make friends,\r\nbecause you are so ready to see the good point in the characters of\r\nthose you meet.'”\r\n\r\nI close this imperfect notice of some features in the character of this\r\nmost honored and beloved of physicians by applying to him the words\r\nwhich were written of William Heberden, whose career was not unlike his\r\nown, and who lived to the same patriarchal age.\r\n\r\n“From his early youth he had always entertained a deep sense of\r\nreligion, a consummate love of virtue, an ardent thirst after knowledge,\r\nand an earnest desire to promote the welfare and happiness of all\r\nmankind. By these qualities, accompanied with great sweetness of\r\nmanners, he acquired the love and esteem of all good men, in a degree\r\nwhich perhaps very few have experienced; and after passing an active\r\nlife with the uniform testimony of a good conscience, he became an\r\neminent example of its influence, in the cheerfulness and serenity of\r\nhis latest age.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the man whom I offer to you as a model, young gentlemen, at the\r\noutset of your medical career. I hope that many of you will recognize\r\nsome traits of your own special teachers scattered through various parts\r\nof the land in the picture I have drawn. Let me assure you that whatever\r\nyou may learn in this or any other course of public lectures,--and\r\nI trust you will learn a great deal,--the daily guidance, counsel,\r\nexample, of your medical father, for such the Oath of Hippocrates tells\r\nyou to consider your preceptor, will, if he is in any degree like him\r\nof whom I have spoken, be the foundation on which all that we teach is\r\nreared, and perhaps outlive most of our teachings, as in Dr. Jackson's\r\nmemory the last lessons that remained with him were those of his Old\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICAL PROFESSION IN MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nA Lecture of a Course by members of the Massachusetts Historical\r\nSociety, delivered before the Lowell Institute, January 29, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe medical history of eight generations, told in an hour, must be in\r\nmany parts a mere outline. The details I shall give will relate chiefly\r\nto the first century. I shall only indicate the leading occurrences,\r\nwith the more prominent names of the two centuries which follow, and\r\nadd some considerations suggested by the facts which have been passed in\r\nreview.\r\n\r\nA geographer who was asked to describe the tides of Massachusetts\r\nBay, would have to recognize the circumstance that they are a limited\r\nmanifestation of a great oceanic movement. To consider them apart from\r\nthis, would be to localize a planetary phenomenon, and to provincialize\r\na law of the universe. The art of healing in Massachusetts has shared\r\nmore or less fully and readily the movement which, with its periods of\r\nebb and flow, has been raising its level from age to age throughout the\r\nbetter part of Christendom. Its practitioners brought with them much of\r\nthe knowledge and many of the errors of the Old World; they have always\r\nbeen in communication with its wisdom and its folly; it is not\r\nwithout interest to see how far the new conditions in which they found\r\nthemselves have been favorable or unfavorable to the growth of sound\r\nmedical knowledge and practice.\r\n\r\nThe state of medicine is an index of the civilization of an age and\r\ncountry,--one of the best, perhaps, by which it can be judged. Surgery\r\ninvokes the aid of all the mechanical arts. From the rude violences\r\nof the age of stone,--a relic of which we may find in the practice of\r\nZipporah, the wife of Moses,--to the delicate operations of to-day\r\nupon patients lulled into temporary insensibility, is a progress which\r\npresupposes a skill in metallurgy and in the labors of the workshop and\r\nthe laboratory it has taken uncounted generations to accumulate. Before\r\nthe morphia which deadens the pain of neuralgia, or the quinine which\r\narrests the fit of an ague, can find their place in our pharmacies,\r\ncommerce must have perfected its machinery, and science must have\r\nrefined its processes, through periods only to be counted by the life of\r\nnations. Before the means which nature and art have put in the hands of\r\nthe medical practitioner can be fairly brought into use, the prejudices\r\nof the vulgar must be overcome, the intrusions of false philosophy must\r\nbe fenced out, and the partnership with the priesthood dissolved. All\r\nthis implies that freedom and activity of thought which belong only to\r\nthe most advanced conditions of society; and the progress towards this\r\nis by gradations as significant of wide-spread changes, as are the\r\nvarying states of the barometer of far-extended conditions of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nApart, then, from its special and technical interest, my subject has a\r\nmeaning which gives a certain importance, and even dignity, to details\r\nin themselves trivial and almost unworthy of record. A medical entry in\r\nGovernor Winthrop's journal may seem at first sight a mere curiosity;\r\nbut, rightly interpreted, it is a key to his whole system of belief\r\nas to the order of the universe and the relations between man and his\r\nMaker. Nothing sheds such light on the superstitions of an age as the\r\nprevailing interpretation and treatment of disease. When the touch of\r\na profligate monarch was a cure for one of the most inveterate of\r\nmaladies, when the common symptoms of hysteria were prayed over as marks\r\nof demoniacal possession, we might well expect the spiritual realms of\r\nthought to be peopled with still stranger delusions.\r\n\r\nLet us go before the Pilgrims of the Mayflower, and look at the shores\r\non which they were soon to land. A wasting pestilence had so thinned\r\nthe savage tribes that it was sometimes piously interpreted as having\r\nprovidentially prepared the way for the feeble band of exiles. Cotton\r\nMather, who, next to the witches, hated the “tawnies,” “wild beasts,”\r\n “blood-hounds,” “rattlesnakes,” “infidels,” as in different places he\r\ncalls the unhappy Aborigines, describes the condition of things in his\r\nlively way, thus: “The Indians in these Parts had newly, even about a\r\nYear or Two before, been visited with such a prodigious Pestilence; as\r\ncarried away not a Tenth, but Nine Parts of Ten (yea't is said Nineteen\r\nof Twenty) among them so that the Woods were almost cleared of those\r\npernicious Creatures to make Room for a better Growth.”\r\n\r\nWhat this pestilence was has been much discussed. It is variously\r\nmentioned by different early writers as “the plague,” “a great and\r\ngrievous plague,” “a sore consumption,” as attended with spots which\r\nleft unhealed places on those who recovered, as making the “whole\r\nsurface yellow as with a garment.” Perhaps no disease answers all these\r\nconditions so well as smallpox. We know from different sources what\r\nfrightful havoc it made among the Indians in after years,--in 1631,\r\nfor instance, when it swept away the aboriginal inhabitants of “whole\r\ntowns,” and in 1633. We have seen a whole tribe, the Mandans, extirpated\r\nby it in our own day. The word “plague” was used very vaguely, as in\r\nthe description of the “great sickness” found among the Indians by the\r\nexpedition of 1622. This same great sickness could hardly have been\r\nyellow fever, as it occurred in the month of November. I cannot think,\r\ntherefore, that either the scourge of the East or our Southern\r\nmalarial pestilence was the disease that wasted the Indians. As for the\r\nyellowness like a garment, that is too familiar to the eyes of all who\r\nhave ever looked on the hideous mask of confluent variola.\r\n\r\nWithout the presence or the fear of these exotic maladies, the forlorn\r\nvoyagers of the Mayflower had sickness enough to contend with. At their\r\nfirst landing at Cape Cod, gaunt and hungry and longing for fresh food,\r\nthey found upon the sandy shore “great mussels, and very fat and full of\r\nsea-pearl.” Sailors and passengers indulged in the treacherous delicacy;\r\nwhich seems to have been the sea-clam; and found that these mollusks,\r\nlike the shell the poet tells of, remembered their august abode, and\r\ntreated the way-worn adventurers to a gastric reminiscence of the\r\nheaving billows. In the mean time it blew and snowed and froze. The\r\nwater turned to ice on their clothes, and made them many times like\r\ncoats of iron. Edward Tilley had like to have “sounded” with cold. The\r\ngunner, too, was sick unto death, but “hope of trucking” kept him on his\r\nfeet,--a Yankee, it should seem, when he first touched the shore of New\r\nEngland. Most, if not all, got colds and coughs, which afterwards turned\r\nto scurvy, whereof many died.\r\n\r\nHow can we wonder that the crowded and tempest-tossed voyagers, many\r\nof them already suffering, should have fallen before the trials of the\r\nfirst winter in Plymouth? Their imperfect shelter, their insufficient\r\nsupply of bread, their salted food, now in unwholesome condition,\r\naccount too well for the diseases and the mortality that marked this\r\nfirst dreadful season; weakness, swelling of the limbs, and other signs\r\nof scurvy, betrayed the want of proper nourishment and protection from\r\nthe elements. In December six of their number died, in January eight, in\r\nFebruary, seventeen, in March thirteen. With the advance of spring\r\nthe mortality diminished, the sick and lame began to recover, and the\r\ncolonists, saddened but not disheartened, applied themselves to the\r\nlabors of the opening year.\r\n\r\nOne of the most pressing needs of the early colonists must have been\r\nthat of physicians and surgeons. In Mr. Savage's remarkable Genealogical\r\nDictionary of the first settlers who came over before 1692 and their\r\ndescendants to the third generation, I find scattered through the\r\nfour crowded volumes the names of one hundred and thirty-four medical\r\npractitioners. Of these, twelve, and probably many more, practised\r\nsurgery; three were barber-surgeons. A little incident throws a glimmer\r\nfrom the dark lantern of memory upon William Direly, one of these\r\npractitioners with the razor and the lancet. He was lost between Boston\r\nand Roxbury in a violent tempest of wind and snow; ten days afterwards\r\na son was born to his widow, and with a touch of homely sentiment, I had\r\nalmost said poetry, they called the little creature “Fathergone” Direly.\r\nSix or seven, probably a larger number, were ministers as well as\r\nphysicians, one of whom, I am sorry to say, took to drink and tumbled\r\ninto the Connecticut River, and so ended. One was not only doctor, but\r\nalso schoolmaster and poet. One practised medicine and kept a tavern.\r\nOne was a butcher, but calls himself a surgeon in his will, a union of\r\ncallings which suggests an obvious pleasantry. One female practitioner,\r\nemployed by her own sex,--Ann Moore,--was the precursor of that intrepid\r\nsisterhood whose cause it has long been my pleasure and privilege to\r\nadvocate on all fitting occasions.\r\n\r\nOutside of this list I must place the name of Thomas Wilkinson, who was\r\ncomplained of, in 1676, for practising contrary to law.\r\n\r\nMany names in the catalogue of these early physicians have been\r\nassociated, in later periods, with the practice of the profession,\r\n--among them, Boylston, Clark, Danforth, Homan, Jeffrey, Kittredge,\r\nOliver, Peaslee, Randall, Shattuck, Thacher, Wellington, Williams,\r\nWoodward. Touton was a Huguenot, Burchsted a German from Silesia,\r\nLunerus a German or a Pole; “Pighogg Churrergeon,” I hope, for the honor\r\nof the profession, was only Peacock disguised under this alias, which\r\nwould not, I fear, prove very attractive to patients.\r\n\r\nWhat doctrines and practice were these colonists likely to bring, with\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nTwo principal schools of medical practice prevailed in the Old World\r\nduring the greater part of the seventeenth century. The first held to\r\nthe old methods of Galen: its theory was that the body, the microcosm,\r\nlike the macrocosm, was made up of the four elements--fire, air, water,\r\nearth; having respectively the qualities hot, dry, moist, cold. The body\r\nwas to be preserved in health by keeping each of these qualities in its\r\nnatural proportion; heat, by the proper temperature; moisture, by the\r\ndue amount of fluid; and so as to the rest. Diseases which arose from\r\nexcess of heat were to be attacked by cooling remedies; those from\r\nexcess of cold, by heating ones; and so of the other derangements of\r\nbalance. This was truly the principle of contraries contrariis, which\r\nill-informed persons have attempted to make out to be the general\r\ndoctrine of medicine, whereas there is no general dogma other than this:\r\ndisease is to be treated by anything that is proved to cure it. The\r\nmeans the Galenist employed were chiefly diet and vegetable remedies,\r\nwith the use of the lancet and other depleting agents. He attributed the\r\nfour fundamental qualities to different vegetables, in four different\r\ndegrees; thus chicory was cold in the fourth degree, pepper was hot in\r\nthe fourth, endive was cold and dry in the second, and bitter almonds\r\nwere hot in the first and dry in the second degree. When we say “cool as\r\na cucumber,” we are talking Galenism. The seeds of that vegetable ranked\r\nas one of “the four greater cold seeds” of this system.\r\n\r\nGalenism prevailed mostly in the south of Europe and France. The readers\r\nof Moliere will have no difficulty in recalling some of its favorite\r\nmodes of treatment, and the abundant mirth he extracted from them.\r\n\r\nThese Galenists were what we should call “herb-doctors” to-day. Their\r\ninsignificant infusions lost credit after a time; their absurdly\r\ncomplicated mixtures excited contempt, and their nauseous prescriptions\r\nprovoked loathing and disgust. A simpler and bolder practice found\r\nwelcome in Germany, depending chiefly on mineral remedies, mercury,\r\nantimony, sulphur, arsenic, and the use, sometimes the secret use,\r\nof opium. Whatever we think of Paracelsus, the chief agent in the\r\nintroduction of these remedies, and whatever limits we may assign to the\r\nuse of these long-trusted mineral drugs, there can be no doubt that\r\nthe chemical school, as it was called, did a great deal towards the\r\nexpurgation of the old, overloaded, and repulsive pharmacopoeia. We\r\nshall find evidence in the practice of our New-England physicians of the\r\nfirst century, that they often employed chemical remedies, and that, by\r\nthe early part of the following century, their chief trust was in the\r\nfew simple, potent drugs of Paracelsus.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that many of the practitioners of medicine, during the\r\nfirst century of New England, were clergymen. This relation between\r\nmedicine and theology has existed from a very early period; from the\r\nEgyptian priest to the Indian medicine-man, the alliance has been\r\nmaintained in one form or another. The partnership was very common among\r\nour British ancestors. Mr. Ward, the Vicar of Stratford-on-Avon, himself\r\na notable example of the union of the two characters, writing about\r\n1660, says,\r\n\r\n“The Saxons had their blood-letters, but under the Normans physicke,\r\nbegunne in England; 300 years agoe itt was not a distinct profession by\r\nitself, but practised by men in orders, witness Nicholas de Ternham,\r\nthe chief English physician and Bishop of Durham; Hugh of Evesham, a\r\nphysician and cardinal; Grysant, physician and pope; John Chambers, Dr.\r\nof Physick, was the first Bishop of Peterborough; Paul Bush, a bachelor\r\nof divinitie in Oxford, was a man well read in physick as well as\r\ndivinitie, he was the first bishop of Bristol.”\r\n\r\n“Again in King Richard the Second's time physicians and divines were not\r\ndistinct professions; for one Tydeman, Bishop of Landaph and Worcester,\r\nwas physician to King Richard the Second.”\r\n\r\nThis alliance may have had its share in creating and keeping up the many\r\nsuperstitions which have figured so largely in the history of medicine.\r\nIt is curious to see that a medical work left in manuscript by the Rev.\r\nCotton Mather and hereafter to be referred to, is running over\r\nwith follies and superstitious fancies; while his contemporary and\r\nfellow-townsman, William Douglass, relied on the same few simple\r\nremedies which, through Dr. Edward Holyoke and Dr. James Jackson, have\r\ncome down to our own time, as the most important articles of the materia\r\nmedica.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a general glance at some of the conditions of the\r\nearly settlers; and first, as to the healthfulness of the climate. The\r\nmortality of the season that followed the landing of the Pilgrims at\r\nPlymouth has been sufficiently accounted for. After this, the colonists\r\nseem to have found the new country agreeing very well with their English\r\nconstitutions. Its clear air is the subject of eulogy. Its dainty\r\nsprings of sweet water are praised not only by Higginson and Wood, but\r\neven the mischievous Morton says, that for its delicate waters “Canaan\r\ncame not near this country.” There is a tendency to dilate on these\r\nsimple blessings, which reminds one a little of the Marchioness in\r\nDickens's story, with her orange-peel-and-water beverage. Still more\r\ndoes one feel the warmth of coloring,--such as we expect from converts\r\nto a new faith, and settlers who want to entice others over to their\r\nclearings, when Winslow speaks, in 1621, of “abundance of roses, white,\r\nred, and damask; single, but very sweet indeed;” a most of all, however,\r\nwhen, in the same connection, he says, “Here are grapes white and\r\nred, and very sweet and strong also.” This of our wild grape, a little\r\nvegetable Indian, which scalps a civilized man's mouth, as his animal\r\nrepresentative scalps his cranium. But there is something quite charming\r\nin Winslow's picture of the luxury in which they are living. Lobsters,\r\noysters, eels, mussels, fish and fowl, delicious fruit, including the\r\ngrapes aforesaid,--if they only had “kine, horses, and sheep,” he makes\r\nno question but men would live as contented here as in any part of the\r\nworld. We cannot help admiring the way in which they took their trials,\r\nand made the most of their blessings.\r\n\r\n“And how Content they were,” says Cotton Mather, “when an Honest Man, as\r\nI have heard, inviting his Friends to a Dish of Clams, at the Table gave\r\nThanks to Heaven, who had given them to suck the abundance of the Seas,\r\nand of the Treasures Hid in the Sands!”\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, as it would seem, except for this buoyant\r\ndetermination to make the best of everything, they hardly appear to\r\nrecognize the difference of the climate from that which they had left.\r\nAfter almost three years' experience, Winslow says, he can scarce\r\ndistinguish New England from Old England, in respect of heat and cold,\r\nfrost, snow, rain, winds, etc. The winter, he thinks (if there is a\r\ndifference), is sharper and longer; but yet he may be deceived by the\r\nwant of the comforts he enjoyed at home. He cannot conceive any\r\nclimate to agree better with the constitution of the English, not being\r\noppressed with extremity of heats, nor nipped by biting cold:\r\n\r\n“By which means, blessed be God, we enjoy our health, notwithstanding\r\nthose difficulties we have undergone, in such a measure as would have\r\nbeen admired, if we had lived in England with the like means.”\r\n\r\nEdward Johnson, after mentioning the shifts to which they were put for\r\nfood, says,--\r\n\r\n“And yet, methinks, our children are as cheerful, fat, and lusty, with\r\nfeeding upon those mussels, clams, and other fish, as they were in\r\nEngland with their fill of bread.”\r\n\r\nHigginson, himself a dyspeptic, “continually in physic,” as he says, and\r\naccustomed to dress in thick clothing, and to comfort his stomach with\r\ndrink that was “both strong and stale,”--the “jolly good ale and old,” I\r\nsuppose, of free and easy Bishop Still's song,--found that he both could\r\nand did oftentimes drink New England water very well,--which he seems\r\nto look upon as a remarkable feat. He could go as lightclad as any,\r\ntoo, with only a light stuff cassock upon his shirt, and stuff breeches\r\nwithout linings. Two of his children were sickly: one,--little misshapen\r\nMary,--died on the passage, and, in her father's words, “was the first\r\nin our ship that was buried in the bowels of the great Atlantic sea;”\r\n the other, who had been “most lamentably handled” by disease, recovered\r\nalmost entirely “by the very wholesomeness of the air, altering,\r\ndigesting, and drying up the cold and crude humors of the body.”\r\n Wherefore, he thinks it a wise course for all cold complexions to come\r\nto take physic in New England, and ends with those often quoted words,\r\nthat “a sup of New England's air is better than a whole draught of Old\r\nEngland's ale.” Mr. Higginson died, however, “of a hectic fever,” a\r\nlittle more than a year after his arrival.\r\n\r\nThe medical records which I shall cite show that the colonists were not\r\nexempt from the complaints of the Old World. Besides the common diseases\r\nto which their descendants are subject, there were two others, to\r\nsay nothing of the dreaded small-pox, which later medical science has\r\ndisarmed,--little known among us at the present day, but frequent\r\namong the first settlers. The first of these was the scurvy, already\r\nmentioned, of which Winthrop speaks in 1630, saying, that it proved\r\nfatal to those who fell into discontent, and lingered after their former\r\nconditions in England; the poor homesick creatures in fact, whom we so\r\nforget in our florid pictures of the early times of the little band in\r\nthe wilderness. Many who were suffering from scurvy got well when\r\nthe Lyon arrived from England, bringing store of juice of lemons. The\r\nGovernor speaks of another case in 1644; and it seems probable that the\r\ndisease was not of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe other complaint from which they suffered, but which has nearly\r\ndisappeared from among us, was intermittent fever, or fever and ague.\r\nI investigated the question as to the prevalence of this disease in New\r\nEngland, in a dissertation, which was published in a volume with other\r\npapers, in the year 1838. I can add little to the facts there recorded.\r\nOne which escaped me was, that Joshua Scottow, in “Old Men's Tears,”\r\n dated 1691, speaks of “shaking agues,” as among the trials to which they\r\nhad been subjected. The outline map of New England, accompanying the\r\ndissertation above referred to, indicates all the places where I had\r\nevidence that the disease had originated. It was plain enough that\r\nit used to be known in many localities where it has long ceased to\r\nbe feared. Still it was and is remarkable to see what a clean bill of\r\nhealth in this particular respect our barren soil inherited with its\r\nsterility. There are some malarious spots on the edge of Lake Champlain,\r\nand there have been some temporary centres of malaria, within the\r\nmemory of man, on one or more of our Massachusetts rivers, but these are\r\nharmless enough, for the most part, unless the millers dam them, when\r\nthey are apt to retaliate with a whiff from their meadows, that sets the\r\nwhole neighborhood shaking with fever and ague.\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrims of the Mayflower had with them a good physician, a man of\r\nstanding, a deacon of their church, one whom they loved and trusted, Dr.\r\nSamuel Fuller. But no medical skill could keep cold and hunger and\r\nbad food, and, probably enough, desperate homesickness in some of the\r\nfeebler sort, from doing their work. No detailed record remains of what\r\nthey suffered or what was attempted for their relief during the first\r\nsad winter. The graves of those who died were levelled and sowed with\r\ngrain that the losses of the little band might not be suspected by the\r\nsavage tenants of the wilderness, and their story remains untold.\r\n\r\nOf Dr. Fuller's practice, at a later period, we have an account in a\r\nletter of his to Governor Bradford, dated June, 1630. “I have been to\r\nMatapan” (now Dorchester), he says, “and let some twenty of those people\r\nblood.” Such wholesale depletion as this, except with avowed homicidal\r\nintent, is quite unknown in these days; though I once saw the noted\r\nFrench surgeon, Lisfranc, in a fine phlebotomizing frenzy, order some\r\nten or fifteen patients, taken almost indiscriminately, to be bled in a\r\nsingle morning.\r\n\r\nDr. Fuller's two visits to Salem, at the request of Governor Endicott,\r\nseem to have been very satisfactory to that gentleman. Morton, the\r\nwild fellow of Merry Mount, gives a rather questionable reason for the\r\nGovernor's being so well pleased with the physician's doings. The names\r\nunder which he mentions the two personages, it will be seen, are not\r\nintended to be complimentary. “Dr. Noddy did a great cure for Captain\r\nLittleworth. He cured him of a disease called a wife.” William Gager,\r\nwho came out with Winthrop, is spoken of as “a right godly man and\r\nskilful chyrurgeon, but died of a malignant fever not very long after\r\nhis arrival.”\r\n\r\nTwo practitioners of the ancient town of Newbury are entitled to special\r\nnotice, for different reasons. The first is Dr. John Clark, who is said\r\nby tradition to have been the first regularly educated physician who\r\nresided in New England. His portrait, in close-fitting skull-cap, with\r\nlong locks and venerable flowing beard, is familiar to our eyes on the\r\nwall of our Society's antechamber. His left hand rests upon a skull, his\r\nright hand holds an instrument which deserves a passing comment. It is\r\na trephine, a surgical implement for cutting round pieces out of broken\r\nskulls, so as to get at the fragments which have been driven in, and\r\nlift them up. It has a handle like that of a gimlet, with a claw like\r\na hammer, to lift with, I suppose, which last contrivance I do not\r\nsee figured in my books. But the point I refer to is this: the old\r\ninstrument, the trepan, had a handle like a wimble, what we call a brace\r\nor bit-stock. The trephine is not mentioned at all in Peter Lowe's book,\r\nLondon, 1634; nor in Wiseman's great work on Surgery, London, 1676; nor\r\nin the translation of Dionis, published by Jacob Tonson, in 1710. In\r\nfact it was only brought into more general use by Cheselden and Sharpe\r\nso late as the beginning of the last century. As John Clark died\r\nin 1661, it is remarkable to see the last fashion in the way of\r\nskull-sawing contrivances in his hands,--to say nothing of the claw on\r\nthe handle, and a Hey's saw, so called in England, lying on the table\r\nby him, and painted there more than a hundred years before Hey was born.\r\nThis saw is an old invention, perhaps as old as Hippocrates, and may be\r\nseen figured in the “Armamentarium Chirurgicum” of Scultetus, or in the\r\nWorks of Ambroise Pare.\r\n\r\nDr. Clark is said to have received a diploma before he came, for skill\r\nin lithotomy. He loved horses, as a good many doctors do, and left a\r\ngood property, as they all ought to do. His grave and noble presence,\r\nwith the few facts concerning him, told with more or less traditional\r\nauthority, give us the feeling that the people of Newbury, and\r\nafterwards of Boston, had a wise and skilful medical adviser and surgeon\r\nin Dr. John Clark.\r\n\r\nThe venerable town of Newbury had another physician who was less\r\nfortunate. The following is a court record of 1652:\r\n\r\n“This is to certify whom it may concern, that we the subscribers, being\r\ncalled upon to testify against doctor William Snelling for words by him\r\nuttered, affirm that being in way of merry discourse, a health being\r\ndrank to all friends, he answered,\r\n\r\n\r\n  “I'll pledge my friends,\r\n   And for my foes\r\n   A plague for their heels\r\n   And,'----\r\n\r\n[a similar malediction on the other extremity of their feet.]\r\n\r\n“Since when he hath affirmed that he only intended the proverb used in\r\nthe west country, nor do we believe he intended otherwise.\r\n\r\n“[Signed] WILLIAM THOMAS.\r\n\r\n“THOMAS MILWARD.”\r\n\r\n“March 12th 1651, All which I acknowledge, and am sorry I did not\r\nexpresse my intent, or that I was so weak as to use so foolish a\r\nproverb.\r\n\r\n“[Signed] GULIELMUS SNELLING.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this confession and apology, the record tells us that\r\n“William Snelling in his presentment for cursing is fined ten shillings\r\nand the fees of court.”\r\n\r\nI will mention one other name among those of the Fathers of the medical\r\nprofession in New England. The “apostle” Eliot says, writing in 1647,\r\n“We never had but one anatomy in the country, which Mr. Giles Firman,\r\nnow in England, did make and read upon very well.”\r\n\r\nGiles Firmin, as the name is commonly spelled, practised physic in this\r\ncountry for a time. He seems to have found it a poor business; for, in a\r\nletter to Governor Winthrop, he says, “I am strongly sett upon to studye\r\ndivinitie: my studyes else must be lost, for physick is but a meene\r\nhelpe.”\r\n\r\nGiles Firmin's Lectures on Anatomy were the first scientific teachings\r\nof the New World. While the Fathers were enlightened enough to permit\r\nsuch instructions, they were severe in dealing with quackery; for, in\r\n1631, our court records show that one Nicholas Knopp, or Knapp, was\r\nsentenced to be fined or whipped “for taking upon him to cure the\r\nscurvey by a water of noe worth nor value, which he solde att a very\r\ndeare rate.” Empty purses or sore backs would be common with us to-day\r\nif such a rule were enforced.\r\n\r\nBesides the few worthies spoken of, and others whose names I have not\r\nspace to record, we must remember that there were many clergymen who\r\ntook charge of the bodies as well as the souls of their patients, among\r\nthem two Presidents of Harvard College, Charles Chauncy and Leonard\r\nHoar,--and Thomas Thacher, first minister of the “Old South,” author of\r\nthe earliest medical treatises printed in the country, [A Brief Rule to\r\nGuide the Common People in Small pox and Measles. 1674.] whose epitaph\r\nin Latin and Greek, said to have been written by Eleazer, an “Indian\r\nYouth” and a member of the Senior Class of Harvard College, may be found\r\nin the “Magnalia.” I miss this noble savage's name in our triennial\r\ncatalogue; and as there is many a slip between the cup and lip, one is\r\ntempted to guess that he may have lost his degree by some display of his\r\nnative instinct,--possibly a flourish of the tomahawk or scalping-knife.\r\nHowever this may have been, the good man he celebrated was a notable\r\ninstance of the Angelical Conjunction, as the author of the “Magnalia”\r\n calls it, of the offices of clergyman and medical practitioner.\r\n\r\nMichael Wigglesworth, author of the “Day of Doom,” attended the sick,\r\n“not only as a Pastor, but as a Physician too, and this, not only in\r\nhis own town, but also in all those of the vicinity.” Mather says of the\r\nsons of Charles Chauncy, “All of these did, while they had Opportunity,\r\nPreach the Gospel; and most, if not all of them, like their excellent\r\nFather before them, had an eminent skill in physick added unto their\r\nother accomplishments,” etc. Roger Williams is said to have saved many\r\nin a kind of pestilence which swept away many Indians.\r\n\r\nTo these names must be added, as sustaining a certain relation to the\r\nhealing art, that of the first Governor Winthrop, who is said by John\r\nCotton to have been “Help for our Bodies by Physick [and] for our\r\nEstates by Law,” and that of his son, the Governor of Connecticut, who,\r\nas we shall see, was as much physician as magistrate.\r\n\r\nI had submitted to me for examination, in 1862, a manuscript found among\r\nthe Winthrop Papers, marked with the superscription, “For my worthy\r\nfriend Mr. Wintrop,” dated in 1643, London, signed Edward Stafford, and\r\ncontaining medical directions and prescriptions. It may be remembered by\r\nsome present that I wrote a report on this paper, which was published\r\nin the “Proceedings” of this Society. Whether the paper was written for\r\nGovernor John Winthrop of Massachusetts, or for his son, Governor John\r\nof Connecticut, there is no positive evidence that I have been able\r\nto obtain. It is very interesting, however, as giving short and simple\r\npractical directions, such as would be most like to be wanted and most\r\nuseful, in the opinion of a physician in repute of that day.\r\n\r\nThe diseases prescribed for are plague, small-pox, fevers, king's evil,\r\ninsanity, falling-sickness, and the like; with such injuries as broken\r\nbones, dislocations, and burning with gunpowder. The remedies are of\r\nthree kinds: simples, such as St. John's wort, Clown's all-heal, elder,\r\nparsley, maidenhair, mineral drugs, such as lime, saltpetre, Armenian\r\nbole, crocus metallorum, or sulphuret of antimony; and thaumaturgic or\r\nmystical, of which the chief is, “My black powder against the plague,\r\nsmall-pox; purples, all sorts of feavers; Poyson; either, by Way of\r\nPrevention or after Infection.” This marvellous remedy was made by\r\nputting live toads into an earthen pot so as to half fill it, and baking\r\nand burning them “in the open ayre, not in an house,”--concerning which\r\nlatter possibility I suspect Madam Winthrop would have had something to\r\nsay,--until they could be reduced by pounding, first into a brown, and\r\nthen into a black, powder. Blood-letting in some inflammations, fasting\r\nin the early stage of fevers, and some of those peremptory drugs with\r\nwhich most of us have been well acquainted in our time, the infragrant\r\nmemories of which I will not pursue beyond this slight allusion, are\r\namong his remedies.\r\n\r\nThe Winthrops, to one of whom Dr. Stafford's directions were\r\naddressed, were the medical as well as the political advisers of their\r\nfellow-citizens for three or four successive generations. One of them,\r\nGovernor John of Connecticut, practised so extensively, that, but for\r\nhis more distinguished title in the State, he would have been remembered\r\nas the Doctor. The fact that he practised in another colony, for the\r\nmost part, makes little difference in the value of the records we have\r\nof his medical experience, which have fortunately been preserved, and\r\ngive a very fair idea, in all probability, of the way in which patients\r\nwere treated in Massachusetts, when they fell into intelligent and\r\nsomewhat educated hands, a little after the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury:\r\n\r\nI have before me, while writing, a manuscript collection of the medical\r\ncases treated by him, and recorded at the time in his own hand, which\r\nhas been intrusted to me by our President, his descendant.\r\n\r\nThey are generally marked Hartford, and extend from the year 1657 to\r\n1669. From these, manuscripts, and from the letters printed in the\r\nWinthrop Papers published by our Society, I have endeavored to obtain\r\nsome idea of the practice of Governor John Winthrop, Junior. The learned\r\neye of Mr. Pulsifer would have helped me, no doubt, as it has done in\r\nother cases; but I have ventured this time to attempt finding my own\r\nway among the hieroglyphics of these old pages. By careful comparison\r\nof many prescriptions, and by the aid of Schroder, Salmon, Culpeper, and\r\nother old compilers, I have deciphered many of his difficult paragraphs\r\nwith their mysterious recipes.\r\n\r\nThe Governor employed a number of the simples dear to ancient women,\r\n--elecampane and elder and wormwood and anise and the rest; but he also\r\nemployed certain mineral remedies, which he almost always indicates by\r\ntheir ancient symbols, or by a name which should leave them a mystery\r\nto the vulgar. I am now prepared to reveal the mystic secrets of the\r\nGovernor's beneficent art, which rendered so many good and great as well\r\nas so many poor and dependent people his debtors,--at least, in their\r\nsimple belief,--for their health and their lives.\r\n\r\nHis great remedy, which he gave oftener than any other, was nitre; which\r\nhe ordered in doses of twenty or thirty grains to adults, and of three\r\ngrains to infants. Measles, colics, sciatica, headache, giddiness, and\r\nmany other ailments, all found themselves treated, and I trust bettered,\r\nby nitre; a pretty safe medicine in moderate doses, and one not likely\r\nto keep the good Governor awake at night, thinking whether it might not\r\nkill, if it did not cure. We may say as much for spermaceti, which he\r\nseems to have considered “the sovereign'st thing on earth” for inward\r\nbruises, and often prescribes after falls and similar injuries.\r\n\r\nOne of the next remedies, in point of frequency, which he was in the\r\nhabit of giving, was (probably diaphoretic) antimony; a mild form of\r\nthat very active metal, and which, mild as it was, left his patients\r\nvery commonly with a pretty strong conviction that they had been taking\r\nsomething that did not exactly agree with them. Now and then he gave\r\na little iron or sulphur or calomel, but very rarely; occasionally, a\r\ngood, honest dose of rhubarb or jalap; a taste of stinging horseradish,\r\noftener of warming guiacum; sometimes an anodyne, in the shape of\r\nmithridate,--the famous old farrago, which owed its virtue to poppy\r\njuice; [This is the remedy which a Boston divine tried to simplify. See\r\nElectuarium Novum Alexipharmacum, by Rev. Thomas Harward, lecturer\r\nat the Royal Chappell. Boston, 1732. This tract is in our Society's\r\nlibrary.] very often, a harmless powder of coral; less frequently, an\r\ninert prescription of pleasing amber; and (let me say it softly within\r\npossible hearing of his honored descendant), twice or oftener,--let us\r\nhope as a last resort,--an electuary of millipedes,--sowbugs, if we must\r\ngive them their homely English name. One or two other prescriptions,\r\nof the many unmentionable ones which disgraced the pharmacopoeia of the\r\nseventeenth century, are to be found, but only in very rare instances,\r\nin the faded characters of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe excellent Governor's accounts of diseases are so brief, that we get\r\nonly a very general notion of the complaints for which he prescribed.\r\nMeasles and their consequences are at first more prominent than any\r\nother one affection, but the common infirmities of both sexes and of all\r\nages seem to have come under his healing hand. Fever and ague appears to\r\nhave been of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nHis published correspondence shows that many noted people were in\r\ncommunication with him as his patients. Roger Williams wants a little\r\nof his medicine for Mrs. Weekes's daughter; worshipful John Haynes is\r\nin receipt of his powders; troublesome Captain Underhill wants “a little\r\nwhite vitterall” for his wife, and something to cure his wife's friend's\r\nneuralgia, (I think his wife's friend's husband had a little rather have\r\nhad it sent by the hands of Mrs. Underhill, than by those of the gallant\r\nand discursive captain); and pious John Davenport says, his wife “tooke\r\nbut one halfe of one of the papers” (which probably contained the\r\nmedicine he called rubila), “but could not beare the taste of it, and\r\nis discouraged from taking any more;” and honored William Leete asks for\r\nmore powders for his “poore little daughter Graciana,” though he found\r\nit “hard to make her take it,” delicate, and of course sensitive, child\r\nas she was, languishing and dying before her time, in spite of all the\r\nbitter things she swallowed,--God help all little children in the hands\r\nof dosing doctors and howling dervishes! Restless Samuel Gorton, now\r\ntamed by the burden of fourscore and two years, writes so touching an\r\naccount of his infirmities, and expresses such overflowing gratitude for\r\nthe relief he has obtained from the Governor's prescriptions, wondering\r\nhow “a thing so little in quantity, so little in sent, so little in\r\ntaste, and so little to sence in operation, should beget and bring forth\r\nsuch efects,” that we repent our hasty exclamation, and bless the memory\r\nof the good Governor, who gave relief to the worn-out frame of our\r\nlong-departed brother, the sturdy old heretic of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nWhat was that medicine which so frequently occurs in the printed letters\r\nunder the name of “rubila”? It is evidently a secret remedy, and, so\r\nfar as I know, has not yet been made out. I had almost given it up in\r\ndespair, when I found what appears to be a key to the mystery. In the\r\nvast multitude of prescriptions contained in the manuscripts, most of\r\nthem written in symbols, I find one which I thus interpret:\r\n\r\n“Four grains of (diaphoretic) antimony, with twenty grains of nitre,\r\nwith a little salt of tin, making rubila.” Perhaps something was\r\nadded to redden the powder, as he constantly speaks of “rubifying” or\r\n“viridating” his prescriptions; a very common practice of prescribers,\r\nwhen their powders look a little too much like plain salt or sugar.\r\n\r\nWaitstill Winthrop, the Governor's son, “was a skilful physician,” says\r\nMr. Sewall, in his funeral sermon; “and generously gave, not only his\r\nadvice, but also his Medicines, for the healing of the Sick, which, by\r\nthe Blessing of God, were made successful for the recovery of many.”\r\n “His son John, a member of the Royal Society, speaks of himself as 'Dr.\r\nWinthrop,' and mentions one of his own prescriptions in a letter to\r\nCotton Mather.” Our President tells me that there was an heirloom of the\r\nancient skill in his family, within his own remembrance, in the form of\r\na certain precious eye-water, to which the late President John Quincy\r\nAdams ascribed rare virtue, and which he used to obtain from the\r\npossessor of the ancient recipe.\r\n\r\nThese inherited prescriptions are often treasured in families, I do\r\nnot doubt, for many generations. When I was yet of trivial age, and\r\nsuffering occasionally, as many children do, from what one of my\r\nCambridgeport schoolmates used to call the “ager,”--meaning thereby\r\ntoothache or face-ache,--I used to get relief from a certain plaster\r\nwhich never went by any other name in the family than “Dr. Oliver.”\r\n\r\nDr. James Oliver was my great-great-grandfather, graduated in 1680, and\r\ndied in 1703. This was, no doubt, one of his nostrums; for nostrum,\r\nas is well known, means nothing more than our own or my own particular\r\nmedicine, or other possession or secret, and physicians in old times\r\nused to keep their choice recipes to themselves a good deal, as we have\r\nhad occasion to see.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I found among my old books a small manuscript marked\r\n“James Oliver. This Book Begun Aug. 12, 1685.” It is a rough sort of\r\naccount-book, containing among other things prescriptions for patients,\r\nand charges for the same, with counter-charges for the purchase of\r\nmedicines and other matters. Dr. Oliver practised in Cambridge, where\r\nmay be seen his tomb with inscriptions, and with sculptured figures that\r\nlook more like Diana of the Ephesians, as given in Calmet's Dictionary,\r\nthan like any angels admitted into good society here or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI do not find any particular record of what his patients suffered from,\r\nbut I have carefully copied out the remedies he mentions, and find\r\nthat they form a very respectable catalogue. Besides the usual simples,\r\nelder, parsley, fennel, saffron, snake-root, wormwood, I find the Elixir\r\nProprietatis, with other elixire and cordials, as if he rather fancied\r\nwarming medicines; but he called in the aid of some of the more\r\nenergetic remedies, including iron, and probably mercury, as he bought\r\ntwo pounds of it at one time.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting item is his bill against the estate of Samuel\r\nPason of Roxbury, for services during his last illness. He attended this\r\ngentleman,--for such he must have been, by the amount of physic which he\r\ntook, and which his heirs paid for,--from June 4th, 1696, to September\r\n3d of the same year, three months. I observe he charges for visits as\r\nwell as for medicines, which is not the case in most of his bills. He\r\nopens the attack with a carminative appeal to the visceral conscience,\r\nand follows it up with good hard-hitting remedies for dropsy,--as I\r\nsuppose the disease would have been called,--and finishes off with a\r\nrallying dose of hartshorn and iron.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of honest pride to his descendant that his bill, which\r\nwas honestly paid, as it seems to have been honorably earned, amounted\r\nto the handsome total of seven pounds and two shillings. Let me add that\r\nhe repeatedly prescribes plaster, one of which was very probably the\r\n“Dr. Oliver” that soothed my infant griefs, and for which I blush to say\r\nthat my venerated ancestor received from Goodman Hancock the painfully\r\nexiguous sum of no pounds, no shillings, and sixpence.\r\n\r\nI have illustrated the practice of the first century, from the two\r\nmanuscripts I have examined, as giving an impartial idea of its\r\nevery-day methods. The Governor, Johannes Secundus, it is fair to\r\nremember, was an amateur practitioner, while my ancestor was a professed\r\nphysician. Comparing their modes of treatment with the many scientific\r\nfollies still prevailing in the Old World, and still more with the\r\nextraordinary theological superstitions of the community in which they\r\nlived, we shall find reason, I think, to consider the art of healing\r\nas in a comparatively creditable state during the first century of New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the evidence as to methods of treatment furnished by the\r\nmanuscripts I have cited, I subjoin the following document, to which\r\nmy attention was called by Dr. Shurtleff, our present Mayor. This is a\r\nletter of which the original is to be found in vol. lxix. page 10 of the\r\n“Archives” preserved at the State House in Boston. It will be seen\r\nthat what the surgeon wanted consisted chiefly of opiates, stimulants,\r\ncathartics, plasters, and materials for bandages. The complex and varied\r\nformulae have given place to simpler and often more effective forms of\r\nthe same remedies; but the list and the manner in which it is made out\r\nare proofs of the good sense and schooling of the surgeon, who, it may\r\nbe noted, was in such haste that he neglected all his stops. He might\r\nwell be in a hurry, as on the very day upon which he wrote, a great\r\nbody of Indians--supposed to be six or seven hundred--appeared before\r\nHatfield; and twenty-five resolute young men of Hadley, from which town\r\nhe wrote, crossed the river and drove them away.\r\n\r\nHADLY May 30: 76\r\n\r\nMr RAWSON Sr\r\n\r\nWhat we have recd by Tho: Houey the past month is not the chiefest of\r\nour wants as you have love for poor wounded I pray let us not want for\r\nthese following medicines if you have not a speedy conveyance of them I\r\npray send on purpose they are those things mentioned in my former letter\r\nbut to prevent future mistakes I have wrote them att large wee have\r\ngreat want with the greatest halt and speed let us be supplyed. Sr Yr\r\nSert WILL LOCHS.\r\n\r\n(Endorsed)\r\n\r\nMr. Lockes Letter Recd from the Governor 13 Jane & acquainted ye Council\r\nwith it but could not obtaine any thing to be sent in answer thereto. 13\r\nJune 1676.\r\n\r\nI have given some idea of the chief remedies used by our earlier\r\nphysicians, which were both Galenic and chemical; that is, vegetable and\r\nmineral. They, of course, employed the usual perturbing medicines\r\nwhich Montaigne says are the chief reliance of their craft. There were,\r\ndoubtless, individual practitioners who employed special remedies with\r\nexceptional boldness and perhaps success. Mr. Eliot is spoken of, in\r\na letter of William Leete to Winthrop, Junior, as being under Mr.\r\nGreenland's mercurial administrations. The latter was probably enough\r\none of these specialists.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of remedies which appears to have been employed\r\noccasionally, but, on the whole, is so little prominent as to imply a\r\ngood deal of common sense among the medical practitioners, as compared\r\nwith the superstitions prevailing around them. I have said that I have\r\ncaught the good Governor, now and then, prescribing the electuary of\r\nmillipedes; but he is entirely excused by the almost incredible fact\r\nthat they were retained in the materia medica so late as when Rees's\r\nCyclopaedia was published, and we there find the directions formerly\r\ngiven by the College of Edinburgh for their preparation. Once or twice\r\nwe have found him admitting still more objectionable articles into his\r\nmateria medica; in doing which, I am sorry to say that he could\r\nplead grave and learned authority. But these instances are very rare\r\nexceptions in a medical practice of many years, which is, on the whole,\r\nvery respectable, considering the time and circumstances.\r\n\r\nSome remedies of questionable though not odious character appear\r\noccasionally to have been employed by the early practitioners, but they\r\nwere such as still had the support of the medical profession. Governor\r\nJohn Winthrop, the first, sends for East Indian bezoar, with other\r\ncommodities he is writing for. Governor Endicott sends him one he had of\r\nMr. Humfrey. I hope it was genuine, for they cheated infamously in\r\nthe matter of this concretion, which ought to come out of an animal's\r\nstomach, but the real history of which resembles what is sometimes told\r\nof modern sausages.\r\n\r\nThere is a famous law-case of James the First's time, in which a\r\ngoldsmith sold a hundred pounds' worth of what he called bezoar, which\r\nwas proved to be false, and the purchaser got a verdict against him.\r\nGovernor Endicott also sends Winthrop a unicorn's horn, which was the\r\nproperty of a certain Mrs. Beggarly, who, in spite of her name, seems to\r\nhave been rich in medical knowledge and possessions. The famous Thomas\r\nBartholinus wrote a treatise on the virtues of this fabulous-sounding\r\nremedy, which was published in 1641, and republished in 1678.\r\n\r\nThe “antimonial cup,” a drinking vessel made of that metal, which, like\r\nour quassia-wood cups, might be filled and emptied in saecula saeculorum\r\nwithout exhausting its virtues, is mentioned by Matthew Cradock, in a\r\nletter to the elder Winthrop, but in a doubtful way, as it was thought,\r\nhe says, to have shortened the days of Sir Nathaniel Riche; and Winthrop\r\nhimself, as I think, refers to its use, calling it simply “the cup.” An\r\nantimonial cup is included in the inventory of Samuel Seabury, who died\r\n1680, and is valued at five shillings. There is a treatise entitled “The\r\nUniversall Remedy, or the Vertues of the Antimoniall Cup, By John Evans,\r\nMinister and Preacher of God's Word, London, 1634,” in our own Society's\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nOne other special remedy deserves notice, because of native growth. I\r\ndo not know when Culver's root, Leptandra Virginica of our National\r\nPharmacopoeia, became noted, but Cotton Mather, writing in 1716 to\r\nJohn Winthrop of New London, speaks of it as famous for the cure of\r\nconsumptions, and wishes to get some of it, through his mediation, for\r\nKatharine, his eldest daughter. He gets it, and gives it to the\r\n“poor damsel,” who is languishing, as he says, and who dies the next\r\nmonth,--all the sooner, I have little doubt, for this uncertain and\r\nviolent drug, with which the meddlesome pedant tormented her in that\r\nspirit of well-meant but restless quackery, which could touch nothing\r\nwithout making mischief, not even a quotation, and yet proved at length\r\nthe means of bringing a great blessing to our community, as we shall see\r\nby and by; so does Providence use our very vanities and infirmities for\r\nits wise purposes.\r\n\r\nExternally, I find the practitioners on whom I have chiefly relied\r\nused the plasters of Paracelsus, of melilot, diachylon, and probably\r\ndiaphoenicon, all well known to the old pharmacopoeias, and some of them\r\nto the modern ones,--to say nothing of “my yellow salve,” of Governor\r\nJohn, the second, for the composition of which we must apply to his\r\nrespected descendant.\r\n\r\nThe authors I find quoted are Barbette's Surgery, Camerarius on Gout,\r\nand Wecherus, of all whom notices may be found in the pages of Haller\r\nand Vanderlinden; also, Reed's Surgery, and Nicholas Culpeper's\r\nPractice of Physic and Anatomy, the last as belonging to Samuel Seabury,\r\nchirurgeon, before mentioned. Nicholas Culpeper was a shrewd charlatan,\r\nand as impudent a varlet as ever prescribed for a colic; but knew very\r\nwell what he was about, and badgers the College with great vigor. A copy\r\nof Spigelius's famous Anatomy, in the Boston Athenaeum, has the names\r\nof Increase and Samuel Mather written in it, and was doubtless early\r\noverhauled by the youthful Cotton, who refers to the great anatomist's\r\nsingular death, among his curious stories in the “Magnalia,” and quotes\r\nhim among nearly a hundred authors whom he cites in his manuscript\r\n“The Angel of Bethesda.” Dr. John Clark's “books and instruments,\r\nwith several chirurgery materials in the closet,” were valued in his\r\ninventory at sixty pounds; Dr. Matthew Fuller, who died in 1678, left a\r\nlibrary valued at ten pounds; and a surgeon's chest and drugs valued at\r\nsixteen pounds.'\r\n\r\nHere we leave the first century and all attempts at any further detailed\r\naccounts of medicine and its practitioners. It is necessary to show in a\r\nbrief glance what had been going on in Europe during the latter part of\r\nthat century, the first quarter of which had been made illustrious in\r\nthe history of medical science by the discovery of the circulation.\r\n\r\nCharles Barbeyrac, a Protestant in his religion, was a practitioner\r\nand teacher of medicine at Montpellier. His creed was in the way of\r\nhis obtaining office; but the young men followed his instructions with\r\nenthusiasm. Religious and scientific freedom breed in and in, until it\r\nbecomes hard to tell the family of one from that of the other. Barbeyrac\r\nthrew overboard the old complex medical farragos of the pharmacopoeias,\r\nas his church had disburdened itself of the popish ceremonies.\r\n\r\nAmong the students who followed his instructions were two Englishmen:\r\none of them, John Locke, afterwards author of an “Essay on the Human\r\nUnderstanding,” three years younger than his teacher; the other, Thomas\r\nSydenham, five years older. Both returned to England. Locke, whose\r\nmedical knowledge is borne witness to by Sydenham, had the good\r\nfortune to form a correct opinion on a disease from which the Earl of\r\nShaftesbury was suffering, which led to an operation that saved\r\nhis life. Less felicitous was his experience with a certain ancilla\r\nculinaria virgo,--which I am afraid would in those days have\r\nbeen translated kitchen-wench, instead of lady of the culinary\r\ndepartment,--who turned him off after she had got tired of him, and\r\ncalled in another practitioner. [Locke and Sydenham, p. 124. By\r\nJohn Brown, M. D. Edinburgh, 1866.] This helped, perhaps, to spoil a\r\npromising doctor, and make an immortal metaphysician. At any rate, Locke\r\nlaid down the professional wig and cane, and took to other studies.\r\n\r\nThe name of Thomas Sydenham is as distinguished in the history of\r\nmedicine as that of John Locke in philosophy. As Barbeyrac was found in\r\nopposition to the established religion, as Locke took the rational side\r\nagainst orthodox Bishop Stillingfleet, so Sydenham went with Parliament\r\nagainst Charles, and was never admitted a Fellow by the College of\r\nPhysicians, which, after he was dead, placed his bust in their hall by\r\nthe side of that of Harvey.\r\n\r\nWhat Sydenham did for medicine was briefly this: he studied the course\r\nof diseases carefully, and especially as affected by the particular\r\nseason; to patients with fever he gave air and cooling drinks, instead\r\nof smothering and heating them, with the idea of sweating out their\r\ndisease; he ordered horseback exercise to consumptives; he, like his\r\nteacher, used few and comparatively simple remedies; he did not give any\r\ndrug at all, if he thought none was needed, but let well enough alone.\r\nHe was a sensible man, in short, who applied his common sense to\r\ndiseases which he had studied with the best light of science that he\r\ncould obtain.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the reform he introduced must have been more or\r\nless felt in this country, but not much before the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century, as his great work was not published until 1675, and\r\nthen in Latin. I very strongly suspect that there was not so much to\r\nreform in the simple practice of the physicians of the new community, as\r\nthere was in that of the learned big-wigs of the “College,” who valued\r\ntheir remedies too much in proportion to their complexity, and the\r\nextravagant and fantastic ingredients which went to their making.\r\n\r\nDuring the memorable century which bred and bore the Revolution, the\r\nmedical profession gave great names to our history. But John Brooks\r\nbelonged to the State, and Joseph Warren belongs to the country and\r\nmankind, and to speak of them would lead me beyond my limited subject.\r\nThere would be little pleasure in dwelling on the name of Benjamin\r\nChurch; and as for the medical politicians, like Elisha Cooke in the\r\nearly part of the century, or Charles Jarvis, the bald eagle of Boston,\r\nin its later years, whether their practice was heroic or not, their\r\npatients were, for he is a bold man who trusts one that is making\r\nspeeches and coaxing voters, to meddle with the internal politics of his\r\ncorporeal republic.\r\n\r\nOne great event stands out in the medical history of this eighteenth\r\ncentury; namely, the introduction of the practice of inoculation for\r\nsmall-pox. Six epidemics of this complaint had visited Boston in the\r\ncourse of a hundred years. Prayers had been asked in the churches for\r\nmore than a hundred sick in a single day, and this many times. About a\r\nthousand persons had died in a twelvemonth, we are told, and, as we may\r\ninfer, chiefly from this cause.\r\n\r\nIn 1721, this disease, after a respite of nineteen years, again appeared\r\nas an epidemic. In that year it was that Cotton Mather, browsing, as\r\nwas his wont, on all the printed fodder that came within reach of\r\nhis ever-grinding mandibles, came upon an account of inoculation as\r\npractised in Turkey, contained in the “Philosophical Transactions.” He\r\nspoke of it to several physicians, who paid little heed to his story;\r\nfor they knew his medical whims, and had probably been bored, as we say\r\nnow-a-days, many of them, with listening to his “Angel of Bethesda,” and\r\nsatiated with his speculations on the Nishmath Chajim.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Mather,--I use a mode of expression he often employed when\r\nspeaking of his honored brethren,--the Reverend Mather was right this\r\ntime, and the irreverent doctors who laughed at him were wrong. One only\r\nof their number disputes his claim to giving the first impulse to the\r\npractice in Boston. This is what that person says: “The Small-Pox spread\r\nin Boston, New England, 1721, and the Reverend Dr. Cotton Mather, having\r\nhad the use of these Communications from Dr. William Douglass (that is,\r\nthe writer of these words); surreptitiously, without the knowledge of\r\nhis Informer, that he might have the honour of a New fangled notion,\r\nsets an Undaunted Operator to work, and in this Country about 290 were\r\ninoculated.”\r\n\r\nAll this has not deprived Cotton Mather of the credit of suggesting, and\r\na bold and intelligent physician of the honor of carrying out, the new\r\npractice. On the twenty-seventh day of June, 1721, Zabdiel Boylston\r\nof Boston inoculated his only son for smallpox,--the first person ever\r\nsubmitted to the operation in the New World. The story of the fierce\r\nresistance to the introduction of the practice; of how Boylston was\r\nmobbed, and Mather had a hand-grenade thrown in at his window; of\r\nhow William Douglass, the Scotchman, “always positive, and sometimes\r\naccurate,” as was neatly said of him, at once depreciated the practice\r\nand tried to get the credit of suggesting it, and how Lawrence Dalhonde,\r\nthe Frenchman, testified to its destructive consequences; of how Edmund\r\nMassey, lecturer at St. Albans, preached against sinfully endeavoring to\r\nalter the course of nature by presumptuous interposition, which he would\r\nleave to the atheist and the scoffer, the heathen and unbeliever, while\r\nin the face of his sermon, afterwards reprinted in Boston, many of our\r\nNew England clergy stood up boldly in defence of the practice,--all this\r\nhas been told so well and so often that I spare you its details. Set\r\nthis good hint of Cotton Mather against that letter of his to John\r\nRichards, recommending the search after witch-marks, and the application\r\nof the water-ordeal, which means throw your grandmother into the water,\r\nif she has a mole on her arm;--if she swims, she is a witch and must be\r\nhanged; if she sinks, the Lord have mercy on her soul!\r\n\r\nThus did America receive this great discovery, destined to save\r\nthousands of lives, via Boston, from the hands of one of our own\r\nMassachusetts physicians.\r\n\r\nThe year 1735 was rendered sadly memorable by the epidemic of the\r\nterrible disease known as “throat distemper,” and regarded by many as\r\nthe same as our “diphtheria.” Dr. Holyoke thinks the more general use\r\nof mercurials in inflammatory complaints dates from the time of their\r\nemployment in this disease, in which they were thought to have proved\r\nspecially useful.\r\n\r\nAt some time in the course of this century medical practice had settled\r\ndown on four remedies as its chief reliance. I must repeat an incident\r\nwhich I have related in another of these Essays. When Dr. Holyoke,\r\nnearly seventy years ago, received young Mr. James Jackson as his\r\nstudent, he showed him the formidable array of bottles, jars, and\r\ndrawers around his office, and then named the four remedies referred to\r\nas being of more importance than all the rest put together. These were\r\n“Mercury, Antimony, Opium, and Peruvian Bark.” I doubt if either of\r\nthem remembered that, nearly seventy years before, in 1730, Dr.\r\nWilliam Douglass, the disputatious Scotchman, mentioned those same four\r\nremedies, in the dedication of his quarrelsome essay on inoculation, as\r\nthe most important ones in the hands of the physicians of his time.\r\n\r\nIn the “Proceedings” of this Society for the year 1863 is a very\r\npleasant paper by the late Dr. Ephraim Eliot, giving an account of\r\nthe leading physicians of Boston during the last quarter of the last\r\ncentury. The names of Lloyd, Gardiner, Welsh, Rand, Bulfinch, Danforth,\r\nJohn Warren, Jeffries, are all famous in local history, and are\r\ncommemorated in our medical biographies. One of them, at least, appears\r\nto have been more widely known, not only as one of the first aerial\r\nvoyagers, but as an explorer in the almost equally hazardous realm of\r\nmedical theory. Dr. John Jeffries, the first of that name, is considered\r\nby Broussais as a leader of medical opinion in America, and so referred\r\nto in his famous “Examen des Doctrines Medicales.”\r\n\r\nTwo great movements took place in this eighteenth century, the effect of\r\nwhich has been chiefly felt in our own time; namely, the establishment\r\nof the Massachusetts Medical Society, and the founding of the Medical\r\nSchool of Harvard University.\r\n\r\nThe third century of our medical history began with the introduction of\r\nthe second great medical discovery of modern times,--of all time up to\r\nthat date, I may say,--once more via Boston, if we count the University\r\nvillage as its suburb, and once more by one of our Massachusetts\r\nphysicians. In the month of July, 1800, Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse of\r\nCambridge submitted four of his own children to the new process of\r\nvaccination,--the first persons vaccinated, as Dr. Zabdiel Boylston's\r\nson had been the first person inoculated in the New World.\r\n\r\nA little before the first half of this century was completed, in the\r\nautumn of 1846, the great discovery went forth from the Massachusetts\r\nGeneral Hospital, which repaid the debt of America to the science of the\r\nOld World, and gave immortality to the place of its origin in the memory\r\nand the heart of mankind. The production of temporary insensibility at\r\nwill--tuto, cito, jucunde, safely, quickly, pleasantly--is one of those\r\ntriumphs over the infirmities of our mortal condition which change the\r\naspect of life ever afterwards. Rhetoric can add nothing to its glory;\r\ngratitude, and the pride permitted to human weakness, that our Bethlehem\r\nshould have been chosen as the birthplace of this new embodiment of the\r\ndivine mercy, are all we can yet find room for.\r\n\r\nThe present century has seen the establishment of all those great\r\ncharitable institutions for the cure of diseases of the body and of the\r\nmind, which our State and our city have a right to consider as among the\r\nchief ornaments of their civilization.\r\n\r\nThe last century had very little to show, in our State, in the way of\r\nmedical literature. The worthies who took care of our grandfathers and\r\ngreat-grandfathers, like the Revolutionary heroes, fought (with disease)\r\nand bled (their patients) and died (in spite of their own remedies); but\r\ntheir names, once familiar, are heard only at rare intervals. Honored\r\nin their day, not unremembered by a few solitary students of the past,\r\ntheir memories are going sweetly to sleep in the arms of the patient\r\nold dry-nurse, whose “blackdrop” is the never-failing anodyne of\r\nthe restless generations of men. Except the lively controversy on\r\ninoculation, and floating papers in journals, we have not much of value\r\nfor that long period, in the shape of medical records.\r\n\r\nBut while the trouble with the last century is to find authors to\r\nmention, the trouble of this would be to name all that we find. Of\r\nthese, a very few claim unquestioned preeminence.\r\n\r\nNathan Smith, born in Rehoboth, Mass., a graduate of the Medical School\r\nof our University, did a great work for the advancement of medicine and\r\nsurgery in New England, by his labors as teacher and author, greater,\r\nit is claimed by some, than was ever done by any other man. The two\r\nWarrens, of our time, each left a large and permanent record of a most\r\nextended surgical practice. James Jackson not only educated a whole\r\ngeneration by his lessons of wisdom, but bequeathed some of the most\r\nvaluable results of his experience to those who came after him, in a\r\nseries of letters singularly pleasant and kindly as well as instructive.\r\nJohn Ware, keen and cautious, earnest and deliberate, wrote the two\r\nremarkable essays which have identified his name, for all time, with\r\ntwo important diseases, on which he has shed new light by his original\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nI must do violence to the modesty of the living by referring to the many\r\nimportant contributions to medical science by Dr. Jacob Bigelow, and\r\nespecially to his discourse on “Self-limited Diseases,” an address which\r\ncan be read in a single hour, but the influence of which will be felt\r\nfor a century.\r\n\r\nNor would the profession forgive me if I forgot to mention the admirable\r\nmuseum of pathological anatomy, created almost entirely by the hands\r\nof Dr. John Barnard Swett Jackson, and illustrated by his own printed\r\ndescriptive catalogue, justly spoken of by a distinguished professor in\r\nthe University of Pennsylvania as the most important contribution which\r\nhad ever been made in this country to the branch to which it relates.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the literature of mental disease, as seen in hospital\r\nreports and special treatises, we can mention the names of Wyman,\r\nWoodward, Brigham, Bell, and Ray, all either natives of Massachusetts or\r\nplaced at the head of her institutions for the treatment of the insane.\r\n\r\nWe have a right to claim also one who is known all over the civilized\r\nworld as a philanthropist, to us as a townsman and a graduate of our own\r\nMedical School, Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, the guide and benefactor of\r\na great multitude who were born to a world of inward or of outward\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nI cannot pass over in silence the part taken by our own physicians\r\nin those sanitary movements which are assuming every year greater\r\nimportance. Two diseases especially have attracted attention, above\r\nall others, with reference to their causes and prevention; cholera,\r\nthe “black death” of the nineteenth century, and consumption, the white\r\nplague of the North, both of which have been faithfully studied and\r\nreported on by physicians of our own State and city. The cultivation of\r\nmedical and surgical specialties, which is fast becoming prevalent, is\r\nbeginning to show its effects in the literature of the profession,\r\nwhich is every year growing richer in original observations and\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nTo these benefactors who have labored for us in their peaceful vocation,\r\nwe must add the noble army of surgeons, who went with the soldiers who\r\nfought the battles of their country, sharing many of their dangers, not\r\nrarely falling victims to fatigue, disease, or the deadly volleys to\r\nwhich they often exposed themselves in the discharge of their duties.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant biographies of the venerable Dr. Thacher, and the worthy\r\nand kind-hearted gleaner, Dr. Stephen W. Williams, who came after him,\r\nare filled with the names of men who served their generation well, and\r\nrest from their labors, followed by the blessing of those for whom\r\nthey endured the toils and fatigues inseparable from their calling. The\r\nhardworking, intelligent country physician more especially deserves\r\nthe gratitude of his own generation, for he rarely leaves any permanent\r\nrecord in the literature of his profession. Books are hard to obtain;\r\nhospitals, which are always centres of intelligence, are remote;\r\nthoroughly educated and superior men are separated by wide intervals;\r\nand long rides, though favorable to reflection, take up much of the time\r\nwhich might otherwise be given to the labors of the study. So it is that\r\nmen of ability and vast experience, like the late Dr. Twitchell, for\r\ninstance, make a great and deserved reputation, become the oracles of\r\nlarge districts, and yet leave nothing, or next to nothing, by which\r\ntheir names shall be preserved from blank oblivion.\r\n\r\nOne or two other facts deserve mention, as showing the readiness of our\r\nmedical community to receive and adopt any important idea or discovery.\r\nThe new science of Histology, as it is now called, was first brought\r\nfully before the profession of this country by the translation of\r\nBichat's great work, “Anatomie Generale,” by the late Dr. George\r\nHayward.\r\n\r\nThe first work printed in this country on Auscultation,--that wonderful\r\nart of discovering disease, which, as it were, puts a window in the\r\nbreast, through which the vital organs can be seen, to all intents\r\nand purposes, was the manual published anonymously by “A Member of the\r\nMassachusetts Medical Society.”\r\n\r\nWe are now in some slight measure prepared to weigh the record of the\r\nmedical profession in Massachusetts, and pass our judgment upon it. But\r\nin order to do justice to the first generation of practitioners, we must\r\ncompare what we know of their treatment of disease with the state of the\r\nart in England, and the superstitions which they saw all around them in\r\nother departments of knowledge or belief.\r\n\r\nEnglish medical literature must have been at a pretty low ebb\r\nwhen Sydenham recommended Don Quixote to Sir Richard Blackmore for\r\nprofessional reading. The College Pharmacopoeia was loaded with the most\r\nabsurd compound mixtures, one of the most complex of which (the same\r\nwhich the Reverend Mr. Harward, “Lecturer at the Royal Chappel in\r\nBoston,” tried to simplify), was not dropped until the year 1801. Sir\r\nKenelm Digby was playing his fantastic tricks with the Sympathetic\r\npowder, and teaching Governor Winthrop, the second, how to cure fever\r\nand ague, which some may like to know. “Pare the patient's nails; put\r\nthe parings in a little bag, and hang the bag round the neck of a live\r\neel, and put him in a tub of water. The eel will die, and the patient\r\nwill recover.”\r\n\r\nWiseman, the great surgeon, was discoursing eloquently on the efficacy\r\nof the royal touch in scrofula. The founder of the Ashmolean Museum at\r\nOxford, consorting with alchemists and astrologers, was treasuring\r\nthe manuscripts of the late pious Dr. Richard Napier, in which certain\r\nletters (Rx Ris) were understood to mean Responsum Raphaelis,--the\r\nanswer of the angel Raphael to the good man's medical questions. The\r\nillustrious Robert Boyle was making his collection of choice and safe\r\nremedies, including the sole of an old shoe, the thigh bone of a hanged\r\nman, and things far worse than these, as articles of his materia medica.\r\nDr. Stafford, whose paper of directions to his “friend, Mr. Wintrop,” I\r\ncited, was probably a man of standing in London; yet toad-powder was his\r\nsovereign remedy.\r\n\r\nSee what was the state of belief in other matters among the most\r\nintelligent persons of the colonies, magistrates and clergymen. Jonathan\r\nBrewster, son of the church-elder, writes the wildest letters to John\r\nWinthrop about alchemy,--“mad for making gold as the Lynn rock-borers\r\nare for finding it.”\r\n\r\nRemember the theology and the diabology of the time. Mr. Cotton's\r\nTheocracy was a royal government, with the King of kings as its nominal\r\nhead, but with an upper chamber of saints, and a tremendous opposition\r\nin the lower house; the leader of which may have been equalled, but\r\ncannot have been surpassed by any of our earth-born politicians. The\r\ndemons were prowling round the houses every night, as the foxes were\r\nsneaking about the hen-roosts. The men of Gloucester fired whole flasks\r\nof gunpowder at devils disguised as Indians and Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nHow deeply the notion of miraculous interference with the course of\r\nnature was rooted, is shown by the tenacity of the superstition about\r\nearthquakes. We can hardly believe that our Professor Winthrop, father\r\nof the old judge and the “squire,” whom many of us Cambridge people\r\nremember so well, had to defend himself against the learned and\r\nexcellent Dr. Prince, of the Old South Church, for discussing their\r\nphenomena as if they belonged to the province of natural science.\r\n\r\nNot for the sake of degrading the aspect of the noble men who founded\r\nour State, do I refer to their idle beliefs and painful delusions,\r\nbut to show against what influences the common sense of the medical\r\nprofession had to assert itself.\r\n\r\nThink, then, of the blazing stars, that shook their horrid hair in the\r\nsky; the phantom ship, that brought its message direct from the other\r\nworld; the story of the mouse and the snake at Watertown; of the mice\r\nand the prayer-book; of the snake in church; of the calf with two heads;\r\nand of the cabbage in the perfect form of a cutlash,--all which innocent\r\noccurrences were accepted or feared as alarming portents.\r\n\r\nWe can smile at these: but we cannot smile at the account of unhappy\r\nMary Dyer's malformed offspring; or of Mrs. Hutchinson's domestic\r\nmisfortune of similar character, in the story of which the physician,\r\nDr. John Clark of Rhode Island, alone appears to advantage; or as\r\nwe read the Rev. Samuel Willard's fifteen alarming pages about an\r\nunfortunate young woman suffering with hysteria. Or go a little\r\ndeeper into tragedy, and see poor Dorothy Talby, mad as Ophelia, first\r\nadmonished, then whipped; at last, taking her own little daughter's\r\nlife; put on trial, and standing mute, threatened to be pressed to\r\ndeath, confessing, sentenced, praying to be beheaded; and none the less\r\npitilessly swung from the fatal ladder.\r\n\r\nThe cooper's crazy wife--crazy in the belief that she has committed the\r\nunpardonable sin--tries to drown her child, to save it from misery;\r\nand the poor lunatic, who would be tenderly cared for to-day in a quiet\r\nasylum, is judged to be acting under the instigation of Satan himself.\r\nYet, after all, what can we say, who put Bunyan's “Pilgrim's Progress,”\r\n full of nightmare dreams of horror, into all our children's hands; a\r\nstory in which the awful image of the man in the cage might well turn\r\nthe nursery where it is read into a madhouse?\r\n\r\nThe miserable delusion of witchcraft illustrates, in a still more\r\nimpressive way, the false ideas which governed the supposed relation of\r\nmen with the spiritual world. I have no doubt many physicians shared in\r\nthese superstitions. Mr. Upham says they--that is, some of them--were\r\nin the habit of attributing their want of success to the fact, that an\r\n“evil hand” was on their patient. The temptation was strong, no doubt,\r\nwhen magistrates and ministers and all that followed their lead were\r\ncontented with such an explanation. But how was it in Salem, according\r\nto Mr. Upham's own statement? Dr. John Swinnerton was, he says, for\r\nmany years the principal physician of Salem. And he says, also, “The\r\nSwinnerton family were all along opposed to Mr. Parris, and kept\r\nremarkably clear from the witchcraft delusion.” Dr. John Swinnerton--the\r\nsame, by the way, whose memory is illuminated by a ray from the genius\r\nof Hawthorne--died the very year before the great witchcraft explosion\r\ntook place. But who can doubt that it was from him that the family had\r\nlearned to despise and to resist the base superstition; or that Bridget\r\nBishop, whose house he rented, as Mr. Upham tells me, the first person\r\nhanged in the time of the delusion, would have found an efficient\r\nprotector in her tenant, had he been living, to head the opposition of\r\nhis family to the misguided clergymen and magistrates?\r\n\r\nI cannot doubt that our early physicians brought with them many\r\nOld-World medical superstitions, and I have no question that they were\r\nmore or less involved in the prevailing errors of the community in which\r\nthey lived. But, on the whole, their record is a clean one, so far as we\r\ncan get at it; and where it is questionable we must remember that there\r\nmust have been many little-educated persons among them; and that all\r\nmust have felt, to some extent, the influence of those sincere and\r\ndevoted but unsafe men, the physic-practising clergymen, who often used\r\nspiritual means as a substitute for temporal ones, who looked upon a\r\nhysteric patient as possessed by the devil, and treated a fractured\r\nskull by prayers and plasters, following the advice of a ruling elder in\r\nopposition to the “unanimous opinion of seven surgeons.”\r\n\r\nTo what results the union of the two professions was liable to lead, may\r\nbe seen by the example of a learned and famous person, who has left on\r\nrecord the product of his labors in the double capacity of clergyman and\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nI have had the privilege of examining a manuscript of Cotton Mather's\r\nrelating to medicine, by the kindness of the librarian of the American\r\nAntiquarian Society, to which society it belongs. A brief notice of this\r\ncurious document may prove not uninteresting.\r\n\r\nIt is entitled “The Angel of Bethesda: an Essay upon the Common Maladies\r\nof Mankind, offering, first, the sentiments of Piety,” etc., etc.,\r\nand “a collection of plain but potent and Approved REMEDIES for the\r\nMaladies.” There are sixty-six “Capsula's,” as he calls them, or\r\nchapters, in his table of contents; of which, five--from the fifteenth\r\nto the nineteenth, inclusive--are missing. This is a most unfortunate\r\nloss, as the eighteenth capsula treated of agues, and we could have\r\nlearned from it something of their degree of frequency in this part of\r\nNew England. There is no date to the manuscript; which, however, refers\r\nto a case observed Nov. 14, 1724.\r\n\r\nThe divine takes precedence of the physician in this extraordinary\r\nproduction. He begins by preaching a sermon at his unfortunate patient.\r\nHaving thrown him into a cold sweat by his spiritual sudorific, he\r\nattacks him with his material remedies, which are often quite as\r\nunpalatable. The simple and cleanly practice of Sydenham, with whose\r\nworks he was acquainted, seems to have been thrown away upon him.\r\nEverything he could find mentioned in the seventy or eighty authors he\r\ncites, all that the old women of both sexes had ever told him of, gets\r\ninto his text, or squeezes itself into his margin.\r\n\r\nEvolving disease out of sin, he hates it, one would say, as he hates its\r\ncause, and would drive it out of the body with all noisome appliances.\r\n“Sickness is in Fact Flagellum Dei pro peccatis mundi.” So saying, he\r\nencourages the young mother whose babe is wasting away upon her breast\r\nwith these reflections:\r\n\r\n“Think; oh the grievous Effects of Sin! This wretched Infant has not\r\narrived unto years of sense enough, to sin after the similitude of the\r\ntransgression committed by Adam. Nevertheless the Transgression of Adam,\r\nwho had all mankind Foederally, yea, Naturally, in him, has involved\r\nthis Infant in the guilt of it. And the poison of the old serpent, which\r\ninfected Adam when he fell into his Transgression, by hearkening to the\r\nTempter, has corrupted all mankind, and is a seed unto such diseases as\r\nthis Infant is now laboring under. Lord, what are we, and what are our\r\nchildren, but a Generation of Vipers?”\r\n\r\nMany of his remedies are at least harmless, but his pedantry and\r\nutter want of judgment betray themselves everywhere. He piles his\r\nprescriptions one upon another, without the least discrimination. He is\r\nrun away with by all sorts of fancies and superstitions. He prescribes\r\neuphrasia, eye-bright, for disease of the eyes; appealing confidently to\r\nthe strange old doctrine of signatures, which inferred its use from the\r\nresemblance of its flower to the organ of vision. For the scattering of\r\nwens, the efficacy of a Dead Hand has been out of measure wonderful. But\r\nwhen he once comes to the odious class of remedies, he revels in them\r\nlike a scarabeus. This allusion will bring us quite near enough to the\r\ninconceivable abominations with which he proposed to outrage the sinful\r\nstomachs of the unhappy confederates and accomplices of Adam.\r\n\r\nIt is well that the treatise was never printed, yet there are passages\r\nin it worth preserving. He speaks of some remedies which have since\r\nbecome more universally known:\r\n\r\n“Among the plants of our soyl, Sir William Temple singles out Five [Six]\r\nas being of the greatest virtue and most friendly to health: and his\r\nfavorite plants, Sage, Rue, Saffron, Alehoof, Garlick, and Elder.”\r\n\r\n“But these Five [Six] plants may admitt of some competitors. The\r\nQUINQUINA--How celebrated: Immoderately, Hyperbolically celebrated!”\r\n\r\nOf Ipecacuanha, he says,--“This is now in its reign; the most\r\nfashionable vomit.”\r\n\r\n“I am not sorry that antimonial emetics begin to be disused.”\r\n\r\nHe quotes “Mr. Lock” as recommending red poppy-water and abstinence from\r\nflesh as often useful in children's diseases.\r\n\r\nOne of his “Capsula's” is devoted to the animalcular origin of diseases,\r\nat the end of which he says, speaking of remedies for this supposed\r\nsource of our distempers:\r\n\r\n“Mercury we know thee: But we are afraid thou wilt kill us too, if we\r\nemploy thee to kill them that kill us.\r\n\r\n“And yett, for the cleansing of the small Blood Vessels, and making way\r\nfor the free circulation of the Blood and Lymph--there is nothing like\r\nMercurial Deobstruents.”\r\n\r\nFrom this we learn that mercury was already in common use, and the\r\nsubject of the same popular prejudice as in our own time.\r\n\r\nHis poetical turn shows itself here and there:\r\n\r\n“O Nightingale, with a Thorn at thy Breast; Under the trouble of a\r\nCough, what can be more proper than such thoughts as these?”...\r\n\r\nIf there is pathos in this, there is bathos in his apostrophe to the\r\nmillipede, beginning “Poor sowbug!” and eulogizing the healing virtues\r\nof that odious little beast; of which he tells us to take “half a pound,\r\nputt 'em alive into a quart or two of wine,” with saffron and other\r\ndrugs, and take two ounces twice a day.\r\n\r\nThe “Capsula” entitled “Nishmath Chajim” was printed in 1722, at New\r\nLondon, and is in the possession of our own Society. He means, by these\r\nwords, something like the Archxus of Van Helmont, of which he discourses\r\nin a style wonderfully resembling that of Mr. Jenkinson in the “Vicar\r\nof Wakefield.” “Many of the Ancients thought there was much of a Real\r\nHistory in the Parable, and their Opinion was that there is, DIAPHORA\r\nKATA TAS MORPHAS, A Distinction (and so a Resemblance) of men as\r\nto their Shapes after Death.” And so on, with Ireaeus, Tertullian,\r\nThespesius, and “the TA TONE PSEUCONE CROMATA,” in the place of\r\n“Sanconiathon, Manetho, Berosus,” and “Anarchon ara kai ateleutaion to\r\npan.”\r\n\r\nOne other passage deserves notice, as it relates to the single medical\r\nsuggestion which does honor to Cotton Mather's memory. It does not\r\nappear that he availed himself of the information which he says he\r\nobtained from his slave, for such I suppose he was.\r\n\r\nIn his appendix to “Variolae Triumphatae,” he says,--\r\n\r\n“There has been a wonderful practice lately used in several parts of the\r\nworld, which indeed is not yet become common in our nation.\r\n\r\n“I was first informed of it by a Garamantee servant of my own, long\r\nbefore I knew that any Europeans or Asiaticks had the least acquaintance\r\nwith it, and some years before I was enriched with the communications\r\nof the learned Foreigners, whose accounts I found agreeing with what I\r\nreceived of my servant, when he shewed me the Scar of the Wound made for\r\nthe operation; and said, That no person ever died of the smallpox, in\r\ntheir countrey, that had the courage to use it.\r\n\r\n“I have since met with a considerable Number of these Africans, who\r\nall agree in one story; That in their countrey grandy-many dy of the\r\nsmall-pox: But now they learn this way: people take juice of smallpox\r\nand cutty-skin and put in a Drop; then by'nd by a little sicky, sicky:\r\nthen very few little things like small-pox; and nobody dy of it;\r\nand nobody have small-pox any more. Thus, in Africa, where the poor\r\ncreatures dy of the smallpox like Rotten Sheep, a merciful God has\r\ntaught them an Infallible preservative. 'T is a common practice, and is\r\nattended with a constant success.”\r\n\r\nWhat has come down to us of the first century of medical practice,\r\nin the hands of Winthrop and Oliver, is comparatively simple and\r\nreasonable. I suspect that the conditions of rude, stern life, in which\r\nthe colonists found themselves in the wilderness, took the nonsense out\r\nof them, as the exigencies of a campaign did out of our physicians\r\nand surgeons in the late war. Good food and enough of it, pure air\r\nand water, cleanliness, good attendance, an anaesthetic, an opiate,\r\na stimulant, quinine, and two or three common drugs, proved to be the\r\nmarrow of medical treatment; and the fopperies of the pharmacopoeia went\r\nthe way of embroidered shirts and white kid gloves and malacca joints,\r\nin their time of need. “Good wine is the best cordiall for her,” said\r\nGovernor John Winthrop, Junior, to Samuel Symonds, speaking of that\r\ngentleman's wife,--just as Sydenham, instead of physic, once ordered a\r\nroast chicken and a pint of canary for his patient in male hysterics.\r\n\r\nBut the profession of medicine never could reach its full development\r\nuntil it became entirely separated from that of divinity. The spiritual\r\nguide, the consoler in affliction, the confessor who is admitted into\r\nthe secrets of our souls, has his own noble sphere of duties; but the\r\nhealer of men must confine himself solely to the revelations of God\r\nin nature, as he sees their miracles with his own eyes. No doctrine\r\nof prayer or special providence is to be his excuse for not looking\r\nstraight at secondary causes, and acting, exactly so far as experience\r\njustifies him, as if he were himself the divine agent which antiquity\r\nfabled him to be. While pious men were praying--humbly, sincerely,\r\nrightly, according to their knowledge--over the endless succession\r\nof little children dying of spasms in the great Dublin Hospital, a\r\nsagacious physician knocked some holes in the walls of the ward, let\r\nGod's blessed air in on the little creatures, and so had already saved\r\nin that single hospital, as it was soberly calculated thirty years ago,\r\nmore than sixteen thousand lives of these infant heirs of immortality.\r\n[Collins's Midwifery, p. 312. Published by order of the Massachusetts\r\nMedical Society. Boston, 1841.]\r\n\r\nLet it be, if you will, that the wise inspiration of the physician was\r\ngranted in virtue of the clergyman's supplications. Still, the habit\r\nof dealing with things seen generates another kind of knowledge, and\r\nanother way of thought, from that of dealing with things unseen; which\r\nknowledge and way of thought are special means granted by Providence,\r\nand to be thankfully accepted.\r\n\r\nThe mediaeval ecclesiastics expressed a great truth in that saying,\r\nso often quoted, as carrying a reproach with it: “Ubi tres medici, duo\r\nathei,”--“Where there are three physicians, there are two atheists.”\r\n\r\nIt was true then, it is true to-day, that the physician very commonly,\r\nif not very generally, denies and repudiates the deity of ecclesiastical\r\ncommerce. The Being whom Ambroise Pare meant when he spoke those\r\nmemorable words, which you may read over the professor's chair in the\r\nFrench School of Medicine, “Te le pensay, et Dieu le guarit,” “I dressed\r\nhis wound, and God healed it,”--is a different being from the God that\r\nscholastic theologians have projected from their consciousness, or\r\nshaped even from the sacred pages which have proved so plastic in\r\ntheir hands. He is a God who never leaves himself without witness, who\r\nrepenteth him of the evil, who never allows a disease or an injury,\r\ncompatible with the enjoyment of life, to take its course without\r\nestablishing an effort, limited by certain fixed conditions, it is true,\r\nbut an effort, always, to restore the broken body or the shattered mind.\r\nIn the perpetual presence of this great Healing Agent, who stays\r\nthe bleeding of wounds, who knits the fractured bone, who expels the\r\nsplinter by a gentle natural process, who walls in the inflammation that\r\nmight involve the vital organs, who draws a cordon to separate the dead\r\npart from the living, who sends his three natural anaesthetics to the\r\nover-tasked frame in due order, according to its need,--sleep, fainting,\r\ndeath; in this perpetual presence, it is doubtless hard for the\r\nphysician to realize the theological fact of a vast and permanent sphere\r\nof the universe, where no organ finds itself in its natural medium,\r\nwhere no wound heals kindly, where the executive has abrogated the\r\npardoning power, and mercy forgets its errand; where the omnipotent is\r\nunfelt save in malignant agencies, and the omnipresent is unseen and\r\nunrepresented; hard to accept the God of Dante's “Inferno,” and of\r\nBunyan's caged lunatic. If this is atheism, call three, instead of two\r\nof the trio, atheists, and it will probably come nearer the truth.\r\n\r\nI am not disposed to deny the occasional injurious effect of the\r\nmaterializing influences to which the physician is subjected. A\r\nspiritual guild is absolutely necessary to keep him, to keep us all,\r\nfrom becoming the “fingering slaves” that Wordsworth treats with such\r\nshrivelling scorn. But it is well that the two callings have been\r\nseparated, and it is fitting that they remain apart. In settling the\r\naffairs of the late concern, I am afraid our good friends remain a\r\nlittle in our debt. We lent them our physician Michael Servetus in\r\nfair condition, and they returned him so damaged by fire as to be quite\r\nuseless for our purposes. Their Reverend Samuel Willard wrote us a not\r\nover-wise report of a case of hysteria; and our Jean Astruc gave\r\nthem (if we may trust Dr. Smith's Dictionary of the Bible) the first\r\ndiscerning criticism on the authorship of the Pentateuch. Our John\r\nLocke enlightened them with his letters concerning toleration; and their\r\nCotton Mather obscured our twilight with his “Nishmath Chajim.”\r\n\r\nYet we must remember that the name of Basil Valentine, the monk, is\r\nassociated with whatever good and harm we can ascribe to antimony;\r\nand that the most remarkable of our specifics long bore the name of\r\n“Jesuit's Bark,” from an old legend connected with its introduction.\r\n“Frere Jacques,” who taught the lithotomists of Paris, owes his\r\necclesiastical title to courtesy, as he did not belong to a religious\r\norder.\r\n\r\nMedical science, and especially the study of mental disease, is\r\ndestined, I believe, to react to much greater advantage on the theology\r\nof the future than theology has acted on medicine in the past. The\r\nliberal spirit very generally prevailing in both professions, and the\r\ngood understanding between their most enlightened members, promise well\r\nfor the future of both in a community which holds every point of human\r\nbelief, every institution in human hands, and every word written in a\r\nhuman dialect, open to free discussion today, to-morrow, and to the end\r\nof time. Whether the world at large will ever be cured of trusting\r\nto specifics as a substitute for observing the laws of health, and to\r\nmechanical or intellectual formula as a substitute for character, may\r\nadmit of question. Quackery and idolatry are all but immortal.\r\n\r\nWe can find most of the old beliefs alive amongst us to-day, only having\r\nchanged their dresses and the social spheres in which they thrive.\r\nWe think the quarrels of Galenists and chemists belong to the past,\r\nforgetting that Thomsonism has its numerous apostles in our community;\r\nthat it is common to see remedies vaunted as purely vegetable, and\r\nthat the prejudice against “mineral poisons,” especially mercury, is\r\nas strong in many quarters now as it was at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century. Names are only air, and blow away with a change of\r\nwind; but beliefs are rooted in human wants and weakness, and die hard.\r\nThe oaks of Dodona are prostrate, and the shrine of Delphi is desolate;\r\nbut the Pythoness and the Sibyl may be consulted in Lowell Street for a\r\nvery moderate compensation. Nostradamus and Lilly seem impossible in our\r\ntime; but we have seen the advertisements of an astrologer in our Boston\r\npapers year after year, which seems to imply that he found believers and\r\npatrons. You smiled when I related Sir Kenelm Digby's prescription with\r\nthe live eel in it; but if each of you were to empty his or her pockets,\r\nwould there not roll out, from more than one of them, a horse-chestnut,\r\ncarried about as a cure for rheumatism? The brazen head of Roger Bacon\r\nis mute; but is not “Planchette” uttering her responses in a hundred\r\nhouses of this city? We think of palmistry or chiromancy as belonging to\r\nthe days of Albertus Magnus, or, if existing in our time, as given over\r\nto the gypsies; but a very distinguished person has recently shown me\r\nthe line of life, and the line of fortune, on the palm of his hand, with\r\na seeming confidence in the sanguine predictions of his career which\r\nhad been drawn from them. What shall we say of the plausible and\r\nwell-dressed charlatans of our own time, who trade in false pretences,\r\nlike Nicholas Knapp of old, but without any fear of being fined or\r\nwhipped; or of the many follies and inanities, imposing on the credulous\r\npart of the community, each of them gaping with eager, open mouth for\r\na gratuitous advertisement by the mention of its foolish name in any\r\nrespectable connection?\r\n\r\nI turn from this less pleasing aspect of the common intelligence which\r\nrenders such follies possible, to close the honorable record of the\r\nmedical profession in this, our ancient Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nWe have seen it in the first century divided among clergymen,\r\nmagistrates, and regular practitioners; yet, on the whole, for the\r\ntime, and under the circumstances, respectable, except where it invoked\r\nsupernatural agencies to account for natural phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn the second century it simplified its practice, educated many\r\nintelligent practitioners, and began the work of organizing for\r\nconcerted action, and for medical teaching.\r\n\r\nIn this, our own century, it has built hospitals, perfected and\r\nmultiplied its associations and educational institutions, enlarged and\r\ncreated museums, and challenged a place in the world of science by its\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the whole course of its history we read a long list of\r\nhonored names, and a precious record written in private memories, in\r\npublic charities, in permanent contributions to medical science, in\r\ngenerous sacrifices for the country. We can point to our capital as the\r\nport of entry for the New World of the great medical discoveries of two\r\nsuccessive centuries, and we can claim for it the triumph over the most\r\ndreaded foe that assails the human body,--a triumph which the annals of\r\nthe race can hardly match in three thousand years of medical history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG PRACTITIONER\r\n\r\n[A Valedictory Address delivered to the Graduating Class of the\r\nBellevue Hospital College, March 2, 1871.]\r\n\r\nThe occasion which calls us together reminds us not a little of that\r\nother ceremony which unites a man and woman for life. The banns have\r\nalready been pronounced which have wedded our young friends to the\r\nprofession of their choice. It remains only to address to them some\r\nfriendly words of cheering counsel, and to bestow upon them the parting\r\nbenediction.\r\n\r\nThis is not the time for rhetorical display or ambitious eloquence. We\r\nmust forget ourselves, and think only of them. To us it is an occasion;\r\nto them it is an epoch. The spectators at the wedding look curiously at\r\nthe bride and bridegroom; at the bridal veil, the orange-flower garland,\r\nthe giving and receiving of the ring; they listen for the tremulous\r\n“I will,” and wonder what are the mysterious syllables the clergyman\r\nwhispers in the ear of the married maiden. But to the newly-wedded pair\r\nwhat meaning in those words, “for better, for worse,” “in sickness and\r\nin health,” “till death us do part!” To the father, to the mother, who\r\nknow too well how often the deadly nightshade is interwoven with the\r\nwreath of orange-blossoms, how empty the pageant, how momentous the\r\nreality!\r\n\r\nYou will not wonder that I address myself chiefly to those who are just\r\nleaving academic life for the sterner struggle and the larger tasks of\r\nmatured and instructed manhood. The hour belongs to them; if others find\r\npatience to listen, they will kindly remember that, after all, they are\r\nbut as the spectators at the wedding, and that the priest is thinking\r\nless of them than of their friends who are kneeling at the altar.\r\n\r\nI speak more directly to you, then, gentlemen of the graduating class.\r\nThe days of your education, as pupils of trained instructors, are over.\r\nYour first harvest is all garnered. Henceforth you are to be sowers as\r\nwell as reapers, and your field is the world. How does your knowledge\r\nstand to-day? What have you gained as a permanent possession? What\r\nmust you expect to forget? What remains for you yet to learn? These are\r\nquestions which it may interest you to consider.\r\n\r\nThere is another question which must force itself on the thoughts\r\nof many among you: “How am I to obtain patients and to keep their\r\nconfidence?” You have chosen a laborious calling, and made many\r\nsacrifices to fit yourselves for its successful pursuit. You wish to be\r\nemployed that you may be useful, and that you may receive the reward of\r\nyour industry. I would take advantage of these most receptive moments\r\nto give you some hints which may help you to realize your hopes and\r\nexpectations. Such is the outline of the familiar talk I shall offer\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nYour acquaintance with some of the accessory branches is probably\r\ngreater now than it will be in a year from now,--much greater than it\r\nwill be ten years from now. The progress of knowledge, it may be feared,\r\nor hoped, will have outrun the text-books in which you studied these\r\nbranches. Chemistry, for instance, is very apt to spoil on one's hands.\r\n“Nous avons change tout cela” might serve as the standing motto of many\r\nof our manuals. Science is a great traveller, and wears her shoes out\r\npretty fast, as might be expected.\r\n\r\nYou are now fresh from the lecture-room and the laboratory. You can pass\r\nan examination in anatomy, physiology, chemistry, materia medica,\r\nwhich the men in large practice all around you would find a more potent\r\nsudorific than any in the Pharmacopceia. These masters of the art of\r\nhealing were once as ready with their answers as you are now, but they\r\nhave got rid of a great deal of the less immediately practical part of\r\ntheir acquisitions, and you must undergo the same depleting process.\r\nHard work will train it off, as sharp exercise trains off the fat of a\r\nprize-fighter.\r\n\r\nYet, pause a moment before you infer that your teachers must have\r\nbeen in fault when they furnished you with mental stores not directly\r\nconvertible to practical purposes, and likely in a few years to lose\r\ntheir place in your memory. All systematic knowledge involves much that\r\nis not practical, yet it is the only kind of knowledge which satisfies\r\nthe mind, and systematic study proves, in the long-run, the easiest way\r\nof acquiring and retaining facts which are practical. There are many\r\nthings which we can afford to forget, which yet it was well to learn.\r\nYour mental condition is not the same as if you had never known what\r\nyou now try in vain to recall. There is a perpetual metempsychosis of\r\nthought, and the knowledge of to-day finds a soil in the forgotten facts\r\nof yesterday. You cannot see anything in the new season of the guano\r\nyou placed last year about the roots of your climbing plants, but it is\r\nblushing and breathing fragrance in your trellised roses; it has scaled\r\nyour porch in the bee-haunted honey-suckle; it has found its way where\r\nthe ivy is green; it is gone where the woodbine expands its luxuriant\r\nfoliage.\r\n\r\nYour diploma seems very broad to-day with your list of accomplishments,\r\nbut it begins to shrink from this hour like the Peau de Chagrin of\r\nBalzac's story. Do not worry about it, for all the while there will be\r\nmaking out for you an ampler and fairer parchment, signed by old Father\r\nTime himself as President of that great University in which experience\r\nis the one perpetual and all-sufficient professor.\r\n\r\nYour present plethora of acquirements will soon cure itself. Knowledge\r\nthat is not wanted dies out like the eyes of the fishes of the Mammoth\r\nCave. When you come to handle life and death as your daily business,\r\nyour memory will of itself bid good-by to such inmates as the\r\nwell-known foramina of the sphenoid bone and the familiar oxides of\r\nmethyl-ethylamyl-phenyl-ammonium. Be thankful that you have once known\r\nthem, and remember that even the learned ignorance of a nomenclature\r\nis something to have mastered, and may furnish pegs to hang facts\r\nupon which would otherwise have strewed the floor of memory in loose\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nBut your education has, after all, been very largely practical. You have\r\nstudied medicine and surgery, not chiefly in books, but at the bedside\r\nand in the operating amphitheatre. It is the special advantage of\r\nlarge cities that they afford the opportunity of seeing a great deal of\r\ndisease in a short space of time, and of seeing many cases of the same\r\nkind of disease brought together. Let us not be unjust to the claims of\r\nthe schools remote from the larger centres of population. Who among us\r\nhas taught better than Nathan Smith, better than Elisha Bartlett? who\r\nteaches better than some of our living contemporaries who divide their\r\ntime between city and country schools? I am afraid we do not always do\r\njustice to our country brethren, whose merits are less conspicuously\r\nexhibited than those of the great city physicians and surgeons,\r\nsuch especially as have charge of large hospitals. There are modest\r\npractitioners living in remote rural districts who are gifted by nature\r\nwith such sagacity and wisdom, trained so well in what is most essential\r\nto the practice of their art, taught so thoroughly by varied experience,\r\nforced to such manly self-reliance by their comparative isolation,\r\nthat, from converse with them alone, from riding with them on their long\r\nrounds as they pass from village to village, from talking over cases\r\nwith them, putting up their prescriptions, watching their expedients,\r\nlistening to their cautions, marking the event of their predictions,\r\nhearing them tell of their mistakes, and now and then glory a little\r\nin the detection of another's blunder, a young man would find himself\r\nbetter fitted for his real work than many who have followed long\r\ncourses of lectures and passed a showy examination. But the young man is\r\nexceptionally fortunate who enjoys the intimacy of such a teacher.\r\nAnd it must be confessed that the great hospitals, infirmaries, and\r\ndispensaries of large cities, where men of well-sifted reputations are\r\nin constant attendance, are the true centres of medical education. No\r\nstudents, I believe, are more thoroughly aware of this than those who\r\nhave graduated at this institution. Here, as in all our larger city\r\nschools, the greatest pains are taken to teach things as well as names.\r\nYou have entered into the inheritance of a vast amount of transmitted\r\nskill and wisdom, which you have taken, warm, as it were, with the life\r\nof your well-schooled instructors. You have not learned all that art has\r\nto teach you, but you are safer practitioners to-day than were many of\r\nthose whose names we hardly mention without a genuflection. I had\r\nrather be cared for in a fever by the best-taught among you than by the\r\nrenowned Fernelius or the illustrious Boerhaave, could they come back to\r\nus from that better world where there are no physicians needed, and, if\r\nthe old adage can be trusted, not many within call. I had rather have\r\none of you exercise his surgical skill upon me than find myself in the\r\nhands of a resuscitated Fabricius Hildanus, or even of a wise Ambroise\r\nPare, revisiting earth in the light of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nYou will not accuse me of underrating your accomplishments. You know\r\nwhat to do for a child in a fit, for an alderman in an apoplexy, for\r\na girl that has fainted, for a woman in hysterics, for a leg that is\r\nbroken, for an arm that is out of joint, for fevers of every color, for\r\nthe sailor's rheumatism, and the tailor's cachexy. In fact you do really\r\nknow so much at this very hour, that nothing but the searching test of\r\ntime can fully teach you the limitations of your knowledge.\r\n\r\nOf some of these you will permit me to remind you. You will never have\r\noutgrown the possibility of new acquisitions, for Nature is endless in\r\nher variety. But even the knowledge which you may be said to possess\r\nwill be a different thing after long habit has made it a part of your\r\nexistence. The tactus eruditus extends to the mind as well as to the\r\nfinger-ends. Experience means the knowledge gained by habitual trial,\r\nand an expert is one who has been in the habit of trying. This is the\r\nkind of knowledge that made Ulysses wise in the ways of men. Many\r\ncities had he seen, and known the minds of those who dwelt in them. This\r\nknowledge it was that Chaucer's Shipman brought home with him from the\r\nsea--\r\n\r\n\r\n   “In many a tempest had his berd be shake.”\r\n\r\nThis is the knowledge we place most confidence in, in the practical\r\naffairs of life.\r\n\r\nOur training has two stages. The first stage deals with our\r\nintelligence, which takes the idea of what is to be done with the\r\nmost charming ease and readiness. Let it be a game of billiards, for\r\ninstance, which the marker is going to teach us. We have nothing to do\r\nbut to make this ball glance from that ball and hit that other ball,\r\nand to knock that ball with this ball into a certain caecal sacculus or\r\ndiverticulum which our professional friend calls a pocket. Nothing can\r\nbe clearer; it is as easy as “playing upon this pipe,” for which Hamlet\r\ngives Guildenstern such lucid directions. But this intelligent Me, who\r\nsteps forward as the senior partner in our dual personality, turns\r\nout to be a terrible bungler. He misses those glancing hits which the\r\nhard-featured young professional person calls “carroms,” and insists on\r\npocketing his own ball instead of the other one.\r\n\r\nIt is the unintelligent Me, stupid as an idiot, that has to try a thing\r\na thousand times before he can do it, and then never knows how he does\r\nit, that at last does it well. We have to educate ourselves through the\r\npretentious claims of intellect, into the humble accuracy of instinct,\r\nand we end at last by acquiring the dexterity, the perfection, the\r\ncertainty, which those masters of arts, the bee and the spider, inherit\r\nfrom Nature.\r\n\r\nBook-knowledge, lecture-knowledge, examination-knowledge, are all in the\r\nbrain. But work-knowledge is not only in the brain, it is in the senses,\r\nin the muscles, in the ganglia of the sympathetic nerves,--all over the\r\nman, as one may say, as instinct seems diffused through every part of\r\nthose lower animals that have no such distinct organ as a brain. See\r\na skilful surgeon handle a broken limb; see a wise old physician smile\r\naway a case that looks to a novice as if the sexton would soon be sent\r\nfor; mark what a large experience has done for those who were fitted\r\nto profit by it, and you will feel convinced that, much as you know,\r\nsomething is still left for you to learn.\r\n\r\nMay I venture to contrast youth and experience in medical practice,\r\nsomething in the way the man painted the lion, that is, the lion under?\r\n\r\nThe young man knows the rules, but the old man knows the exceptions. The\r\nyoung man knows his patient, but the old man knows also his patient's\r\nfamily, dead and alive, up and down for generations. He can tell\r\nbeforehand what diseases their unborn children will be subject to, what\r\nthey will die of if they live long enough, and whether they had better\r\nlive at all, or remain unrealized possibilities, as belonging to a stock\r\nnot worth being perpetuated. The young man feels uneasy if he is\r\nnot continually doing something to stir up his patient's internal\r\narrangements. The old man takes things more quietly, and is much more\r\nwilling to let well enough alone: All these superiorities, if such they\r\nare, you must wait for time to bring you. In the meanwhile (if we will\r\nlet the lion be uppermost for a moment), the young man's senses\r\nare quicker than those of his older rival. His education in all the\r\naccessory branches is more recent, and therefore nearer the existing\r\ncondition of knowledge. He finds it easier than his seniors to accept\r\nthe improvements which every year is bringing forward. New ideas build\r\ntheir nests in young men's brains. “Revolutions are not made by men in\r\nspectacles,” as I once heard it remarked, and the first whispers of\r\na new truth are not caught by those who begin to feel the need of an\r\near-trumpet. Granting all these advantages to the young man, he\r\nought, nevertheless, to go on improving, on the whole, as a medical\r\npractitioner, with every year, until he has ripened into a well-mellowed\r\nmaturity. But, to improve, he must be good for something at the start.\r\nIf you ship a poor cask of wine to India and back, if you keep it a half\r\na century, it only grows thinner and sharper.\r\n\r\nYou are soon to enter into relations with the public, to expend your\r\nskill and knowledge for its benefit, and find your support in the\r\nrewards of your labor. What kind of a constituency is this which is to\r\nlook to you as its authorized champions in the struggle of life against\r\nits numerous enemies?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the persons who seek the aid of the physician are\r\nvery honest and sincere in their wish to get rid of their complaints,\r\nand, generally speaking, to live as long as they can. However\r\nattractively the future is painted to them, they are attached to the\r\nplanet with which they are already acquainted. They are addicted to the\r\ndaily use of this empirical and unchemical mixture which we call air;\r\nand would hold on to it as a tippler does to his alcoholic drinks. There\r\nis nothing men will not do, there is nothing they have not done, to\r\nrecover their health and save their lives. They have submitted to be\r\nhalf-drowned in water, and half-choked with gases, to be buried up to\r\ntheir chins in earth, to be seared with hot irons like galley-slaves, to\r\nbe crimped with knives, like cod-fish, to have needles thrust into\r\ntheir flesh, and bonfires kindled on their skin, to swallow all sorts\r\nof abominations, and to pay for all this, as if to be singed and scalded\r\nwere a costly privilege, as if blisters were a blessing, and leeches\r\nwere a luxury. What more can be asked to prove their honesty and\r\nsincerity?\r\n\r\nThis same community is very intelligent with respect to a great many\r\nsubjects--commerce, mechanics, manufactures, politics. But with regard\r\nto medicine it is hopelessly ignorant and never finds it out. I do not\r\nknow that it is any worse in this country than in Great Britain, where\r\nMr. Huxley speaks very freely of “the utter ignorance of the simplest\r\nlaws of their own animal life, which prevails among even the most highly\r\neducated persons.” And Cullen said before him “Neither the acutest\r\ngenius nor the soundest judgment will avail in judging of a particular\r\nscience, in regard to which they have not been exercised. I have been\r\nobliged to please my patients sometimes with reasons, and I have found\r\nthat any will pass, even with able divines and acute lawyers; the same\r\nwill pass with the husbands as with the wives.” If the community could\r\nonly be made aware of its own utter ignorance, and incompetence to form\r\nopinions on medical subjects, difficult enough to those who give their\r\nlives to the study of them, the practitioner would have an easier task.\r\nBut it will form opinions of its own, it cannot help it, and we cannot\r\nblame it, even though we know how slight and deceptive are their\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nThis is the way it happens: Every grown-up person has either been\r\nill himself or had a friend suffer from illness, from which he has\r\nrecovered. Every sick person has done something or other by somebody's\r\nadvice, or of his own accord, a little before getting better. There\r\nis an irresistible tendency to associate the thing done, and the\r\nimprovement which followed it, as cause and effect. This is the great\r\nsource of fallacy in medical practice. But the physician has some chance\r\nof correcting his hasty inference. He thinks his prescription cured a\r\nsingle case of a particular complaint; he tries it in twenty similar\r\ncases without effect, and sets down the first as probably nothing more\r\nthan a coincidence. The unprofessional experimenter or observer has\r\nno large experience to correct his hasty generalization. He wants to\r\nbelieve that the means he employed effected his cure. He feels grateful\r\nto the person who advised it, he loves to praise the pill or potion\r\nwhich helped him, and he has a kind of monumental pride in himself as\r\na living testimony to its efficacy. So it is that you will find the\r\ncommunity in which you live, be it in town or country, full of brands\r\nplucked from the burning, as they believe, by some agency which, with\r\nyour better training, you feel reasonably confident had nothing to\r\ndo with it. Their disease went out of itself, and the stream from the\r\nmedical fire-annihilator had never even touched it.\r\n\r\nYou cannot and need not expect to disturb the public in the possession\r\nof its medical superstitions. A man's ignorance is as much his private\r\nproperty, and as precious in his own eyes, as his family Bible. You have\r\nonly to open your own Bible at the ninth chapter of St. John's Gospel,\r\nand you will find that the logic of a restored patient was very simple\r\nthen, as it is now, and very hard to deal with. My clerical friends\r\nwill forgive me for poaching on their sacred territory, in return for an\r\noccasional raid upon the medical domain of which they have now and then\r\nbeen accused.\r\n\r\nA blind man was said to have been restored to sight by a young person\r\nwhom the learned doctors of the Jewish law considered a sinner, and, as\r\nsuch, very unlikely to have been endowed with a divine gift of healing.\r\nThey visited the patient repeatedly, and evidently teased him with their\r\nquestions about the treatment, and their insinuations about the young\r\nman, until he lost his temper. At last he turned sharply upon them:\r\n“Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that,\r\nwhereas I was blind, now I see.”\r\n\r\nThis is the answer that always has been and always will be given by most\r\npersons when they find themselves getting well after doing anything, no\r\nmatter what,--recommended by anybody, no matter whom. Lord Bacon, Robert\r\nBoyle, Bishop Berkeley, all put their faith in panaceas which we should\r\nlaugh to scorn. They had seen people get well after using them. Are we\r\nany wiser than those great men? Two years ago, in a lecture before the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society, I mentioned this recipe of Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby for fever and ague: Pare the patient's nails; put the parings in a\r\nlittle bag, and hang the bag round the neck of a live eel, and place him\r\nin a tub of water. The eel will die, and the patient will recover.\r\n\r\nReferring to this prescription in the course of the same lecture, I\r\nsaid: “You smiled when I related Sir Kenehn Digby's prescription, with\r\nthe live eel in it; but if each of you were to empty his or her pockets,\r\nwould there not roll out, from more than one of them, a horse-chestnut,\r\ncarried about as a cure for rheumatism?” Nobody saw fit to empty his or\r\nher pockets, and my question brought no response. But two months ago\r\nI was in a company of educated persons, college graduates every one of\r\nthem, when a gentleman, well known in our community, a man of superior\r\nability and strong common-sense, on the occasion of some talk arising\r\nabout rheumatism, took a couple of very shiny horse-chestnuts from his\r\nbreeches-pocket, and laid them on the table, telling us how, having\r\nsuffered from the complaint in question, he had, by the advice of a\r\nfriend, procured these two horse-chestnuts on a certain time a year or\r\nmore ago, and carried them about him ever since; from which very day he\r\nhad been entirely free from rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThis argument, from what looks like cause and effect, whether it be so\r\nor not, is what you will have to meet wherever you go, and you need not\r\nthink you can answer it. In the natural course of things some thousands\r\nof persons must be getting well or better of slight attacks of colds,\r\nof rheumatic pains, every week, in this city alone. Hundreds of them do\r\nsomething or other in the way of remedy, by medical or other advice, or\r\nof their own motion, and the last thing they do gets the credit of the\r\nrecovery. Think what a crop of remedies this must furnish, if it were\r\nall harvested!\r\n\r\nExperience has taught, or will teach you, that most of the wonderful\r\nstories patients and others tell of sudden and signal cures are like\r\nOwen Glendower's story of the portents that announced his birth. The\r\nearth shook at your nativity, did it? Very likely, and\r\n\r\n\r\n        “So it would have done,\r\n   At the same season, if your mother's cat\r\n   Had kittened, though yourself had ne'er been born.”\r\n\r\nYou must listen more meekly than Hotspur did to the babbling Welshman,\r\nfor ignorance is a solemn and sacred fact, and, like infancy, which it\r\nresembles, should be respected. Once in a while you will have a patient\r\nof sense, born with the gift of observation, from whom you may learn\r\nsomething. When you find yourself in the presence of one who is fertile\r\nof medical opinions, and affluent in stories of marvellous cures,--of\r\na member of Congress whose name figures in certificates to the value of\r\npatent medicines, of a voluble dame who discourses on the miracles she\r\nhas wrought or seen wrought with the little jokers of the sugar-of-milk\r\nglobule-box, take out your watch and count the pulse; also note the time\r\nof day, and charge the price of a visit for every extra fifteen, or, if\r\nyou are not very busy, every twenty minutes. In this way you will turn\r\nwhat seems a serious dispensation into a double blessing, for this class\r\nof patients loves dearly to talk, and it does them a deal of good, and\r\nyou feel as if you had earned your money by the dose you have taken,\r\nquite as honestly as by any dose you may have ordered.\r\n\r\nYou must take the community just as it is, and make the best of it.\r\nYou wish to obtain its confidence; there is a short rule for doing this\r\nwhich you will find useful,--deserve it. But, to deserve it in full\r\nmeasure, you must unite many excellences, natural and acquired.\r\n\r\nAs the basis of all the rest, you must have all those traits of\r\ncharacter which fit you to enter into the most intimate and confidential\r\nrelations with the families of which you are the privileged friend and\r\ncounsellor. Medical Christianity, if I may use such a term, is of very\r\nearly date. By the oath of Hippocrates, the practitioner of ancient\r\ntimes bound himself to enter his patient's house with the sole purpose\r\nof doing him good, and so to conduct himself as to avoid the very\r\nappearance of evil. Let the physician of to-day begin by coming up to\r\nthis standard, and add to it all the more recently discovered virtues\r\nand graces.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of natural ability is requisite to make you a good\r\nphysician, but by no means that disproportionate development of some\r\nspecial faculty which goes by the name of genius. A just balance of the\r\nmental powers is a great deal more likely to be useful than any single\r\ntalent, even were it the power of observation, in excess. For a mere\r\nobserver is liable to be too fond of facts for their own sake, so that,\r\nif he told the real truth, he would confess that he takes more pleasure\r\nin a post-mortem examination which shows him what was the matter with a\r\npatient, than in a case which insists on getting well and leaving him in\r\nthe dark as to its nature. Far more likely to interfere with the sound\r\npractical balance of the mind is that speculative, theoretical tendency\r\nwhich has made so many men noted in their day, whose fame has passed\r\naway with their dissolving theories. Read Dr. Bartlett's comparison of\r\nthe famous Benjamin Rush with his modest fellow-townsman Dr. William\r\nCurrie, and see the dangers into which a passion for grandiose\r\ngeneralizations betrayed a man of many admirable qualities.\r\n\r\nI warn you against all ambitious aspirations outside of your profession.\r\nMedicine is the most difficult of sciences and the most laborious of\r\narts. It will task all your powers of body and mind if you are faithful\r\nto it. Do not dabble in the muddy sewer of politics, nor linger by\r\nthe enchanted streams of literature, nor dig in far-off fields for the\r\nhidden waters of alien sciences. The great practitioners are generally\r\nthose who concentrate all their powers on their business. If there\r\nare here and there brilliant exceptions, it is only in virtue of\r\nextraordinary gifts, and industry to which very few are equal.\r\n\r\nTo get business a man must really want it; and do you suppose that when\r\nyou are in the middle of a heated caucus, or half-way through a delicate\r\nanalysis, or in the spasm of an unfinished ode, your eyes rolling in the\r\nfine frenzy of poetical composition, you want to be called to a teething\r\ninfant, or an ancient person groaning under the griefs of a lumbago?\r\nI think I have known more than one young man whose doctor's sign\r\nproclaimed his readiness to serve mankind in that capacity, but who\r\nhated the sound of a patient's knock, and as he sat with his book or his\r\nmicroscope, felt exactly as the old party expressed himself in my friend\r\nMr. Brownell's poem--\r\n\r\n\r\n     “All I axes is, let me alone.”\r\n\r\nThe community soon finds out whether you are in earnest, and really mean\r\nbusiness, or whether you are one of those diplomaed dilettanti who like\r\nthe amusement of quasi medical studies, but have no idea of wasting\r\ntheir precious time in putting their knowledge in practice for the\r\nbenefit of their suffering fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nThe public is a very incompetent judge of your skill and knowledge, but\r\nit gives its confidence most readily to those who stand well with their\r\nprofessional brethren, whom they call upon when they themselves or their\r\nfamilies are sick, whom they choose to honorable offices, whose writings\r\nand teachings they hold in esteem. A man may be much valued by the\r\nprofession and yet have defects which prevent his becoming a favorite\r\npractitioner, but no popularity can be depended upon as permanent which\r\nis not sanctioned by the judgment of professional experts, and with\r\nthese you will always stand on your substantial merits.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I say of the personal habits you must form if you wish for\r\nsuccess? Temperance is first upon the list. Intemperance in a physician\r\npartakes of the guilt of homicide, for the muddled brain may easily\r\nmake a fatal blunder in a prescription and the unsteady hand transfix\r\nan artery in an operation. Tippling doctors have been too common in the\r\nhistory of medicine. Paracelsus was a sot, Radcliffe was much too fond\r\nof his glass, and Dr. James Hurlbut of Wethersfield, Connecticut, a\r\nfamous man in his time, used to drink a square bottle of rum a day,\r\nwith a corresponding allowance of opium to help steady his nerves. We\r\ncommonly speak of a man as being the worse for liquor, but I was asking\r\nan Irish laborer one day about his doctor, who, as he said, was somewhat\r\ngiven to drink. “I like him best when he's a little that way,” he said;\r\n“then I can spake to him.” I pitied the poor patient who could not\r\nventure to allude to his colic or his pleurisy until his physician was\r\ntipsy.\r\n\r\nThere are personal habits of less gravity than the one I have\r\nmentioned which it is well to guard against, or, if they are formed,\r\nto relinquish. A man who may be called at a moment's warning into\r\nthe fragrant boudoir of suffering loveliness should not unsweeten its\r\natmosphere with reminiscences of extinguished meerschaums. He should\r\nremember that the sick are sensitive and fastidious, that they love the\r\nsweet odors and the pure tints of flowers, and if his presence is not\r\nlike the breath of the rose, if his hands are not like the leaf of the\r\nlily, his visit may be unwelcome, and if he looks behind him he may see\r\na window thrown open after he has left the sick-chamber. I remember too\r\nwell the old doctor who sometimes came to help me through those inward\r\ngriefs to which childhood is liable. “Far off his coming “--shall I say\r\n“shone,” and finish the Miltonic phrase, or leave the verb to the happy\r\nconjectures of my audience? Before him came a soul-subduing whiff\r\nof ipecacuanha, and after him lingered a shuddering consciousness of\r\nrhubarb. He had lived so much among his medicaments that he had at last\r\nbecome himself a drug, and to have him pass through a sick-chamber was a\r\nstronger dose than a conscientious disciple of Hahnemann would think it\r\nsafe to administer.\r\n\r\nNeed I remind you of the importance of punctuality in your engagements,\r\nand of the worry and distress to patients and their friends which the\r\nwant of it occasions? One of my old teachers always carried two watches,\r\nto make quite sure of being exact, and not only kept his appointments\r\nwith the regularity of a chronometer, but took great pains to be at\r\nhis patient's house at the time when he had reason to believe he was\r\nexpected, even if no express appointment was made. It is a good rule;\r\nif you call too early, my lady's hair may not be so smooth as could be\r\nwished, and, if you keep her waiting too long, her hair may be smooth,\r\nbut her temper otherwise.\r\n\r\nYou will remember, of course, always to get the weather-gage of your\r\npatient. I mean, to place him so that the light falls on his face and\r\nnot on yours. It is a kind of, ocular duel that is about to take\r\nplace between you; you are going to look through his features into his\r\npulmonary and hepatic and other internal machinery, and he is going\r\nto look into yours quite as sharply to see what you think about his\r\nprobabilities for time or eternity.\r\n\r\nNo matter how hard he stares at your countenance, he should never be\r\nable to read his fate in it. It should be cheerful as long as there is\r\nhope, and serene in its gravity when nothing is left but resignation.\r\nThe face of a physician, like that of a diplomatist, should be\r\nimpenetrable. Nature is a benevolent old hypocrite; she cheats the sick\r\nand the dying with illusions better than any anodynes. If there are\r\ncogent reasons why a patient should be undeceived, do it deliberately\r\nand advisedly, but do not betray your apprehensions through your\r\ntell-tale features.\r\n\r\nWe had a physician in our city whose smile was commonly reckoned as\r\nbeing worth five thousand dollars a year to him, in the days, too, of\r\nmoderate incomes. You cannot put on such a smile as that any more than\r\nyou can get sunshine without sun; there was a tranquil and kindly nature\r\nunder it that irradiated the pleasant face it made one happier to meet\r\non his daily rounds. But you can cultivate the disposition, and it will\r\nwork its way through to the surface, nay, more,--you can try to wear a\r\nquiet and encouraging look, and it will react on your disposition and\r\nmake you like what you seem to be, or at least bring you nearer to its\r\nown likeness.\r\n\r\nYour patient has no more right to all the truth you know than he has\r\nto all the medicine in your saddlebags, if you carry that kind of\r\ncartridge-box for the ammunition that slays disease. He should get only\r\njust so much as is good for him. I have seen a physician examining a\r\npatient's chest stop all at once, as he brought out a particular sound\r\nwith a tap on the collarbone, in the attitude of a pointer who has just\r\ncome on the scent or sight of a woodcock. You remember the Spartan boy,\r\nwho, with unmoved countenance, hid the fox that was tearing his vitals\r\nbeneath his mantle. What he could do in his own suffering you must\r\nlearn to do for others on whose vital organs disease has fastened its\r\ndevouring teeth. It is a terrible thing to take away hope, even earthly\r\nhope, from a fellow-creature. Be very careful what names you let fall\r\nbefore your patient. He knows what it means when you tell him he has\r\ntubercles or Bright's disease, and, if he hears the word carcinoma,\r\nhe will certainly look it out in a medical dictionary, if he does\r\nnot interpret its dread significance on the instant. Tell him he has\r\nasthmatic symptoms, or a tendency to the gouty diathesis, and he will\r\nat once think of all the asthmatic and gouty old patriarchs he has ever\r\nheard of, and be comforted. You need not be so cautious in speaking\r\nof the health of rich and remote relatives, if he is in the line of\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nSome shrewd old doctors have a few phrases always on hand for patients\r\nthat will insist on knowing the pathology of their complaints without\r\nthe slightest capacity of understanding the scientific explanation. I\r\nhave known the term “spinal irritation” serve well on such occasions,\r\nbut I think nothing on the whole has covered so much ground, and meant\r\nso little, and given such profound satisfaction to all parties, as the\r\nmagnificent phrase “congestion of the portal system.”\r\n\r\nOnce more, let me recommend you, as far as possible, to keep your\r\ndoubts to yourself, and give the patient the benefit of your decision.\r\nFirmness, gentle firmness, is absolutely necessary in this and certain\r\nother relations. Mr. Rarey with Cruiser, Richard with Lady Ann, Pinel\r\nwith his crazy people, show what steady nerves can do with the most\r\nintractable of animals, the most irresistible of despots, and the most\r\nunmanageable of invalids.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot acquire and keep the confidence of your patient, it is\r\ntime for you to give place to some other practitioner who can. If you\r\nare wise and diligent, you can establish relations with the best of them\r\nwhich they will find it very hard to break. But, if they wish to employ\r\nanother person, who, as they think, knows more than you do, do not take\r\nit as a personal wrong. A patient believes another man can save his\r\nlife, can restore him to health, which, as he thinks, you have not the\r\nskill to do. No matter whether the patient is right or wrong, it is a\r\ngreat impertinence to think you have any property in him. Your estimate\r\nof your own ability is not the question, it is what the patient thinks\r\nof it. All your wisdom is to him like the lady's virtue in Raleigh's\r\nsong:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “If she seem not chaste to me,\r\n   What care I how chaste she be?”\r\n\r\nWhat I call a good patient is one who, having found a good physician,\r\nsticks to him till he dies. But there are many very good people who are\r\nnot what I call good patients. I was once requested to call on a\r\nlady suffering from nervous and other symptoms. It came out in the\r\npreliminary conversational skirmish, half medical, half social, that\r\nI was the twenty-sixth member of the faculty into whose arms,\r\nprofessionally speaking, she had successively thrown herself. Not\r\nbeing a believer in such a rapid rotation of scientific crops, I gently\r\ndeposited the burden, commending it to the care of number twenty-seven,\r\nand, him, whoever he might be, to the care of Heaven.\r\n\r\nIf there happened to be among my audience any person who wished to know\r\non what principles the patient should choose his physician, I should\r\ngive him these few precepts to think over:\r\n\r\nChoose a man who is personally agreeable, for a daily visit from an\r\nintelligent, amiable, pleasant, sympathetic person will cost you no more\r\nthan one from a sloven or a boor, and his presence will do more for you\r\nthan any prescription the other will order.\r\n\r\nLet him be a man of recognized good sense in other matters, and the\r\nchance is that he will be sensible as a practitioner.\r\n\r\nLet him be a man who stands well with his professional brethren, whom\r\nthey approve as honest, able, courteous.\r\n\r\nLet him be one whose patients are willing to die in his hands, not one\r\nwhom they go to for trifles, and leave as soon as they are in danger,\r\nand who can say, therefore, that he never loses a patient.\r\n\r\nDo not leave the ranks of what is called the regular profession, unless\r\nyou wish to go farther and fare worse, for you may be assured that\r\nits members recognize no principle which hinders their accepting any\r\nremedial agent proved to be useful, no matter from what quarter it\r\ncomes. The difficulty is that the stragglers, organized under fantastic\r\nnames in pretentious associations, or lurking in solitary dens behind\r\ndoors left ajar, make no real contributions to the art of healing. When\r\nthey bring forward a remedial agent like chloral, like the bromide\r\nof potassium, like ether, used as an anesthetic, they will find no\r\ndifficulty in procuring its recognition.\r\n\r\nSome of you will probably be more or less troubled by the pretensions\r\nof that parody of mediaeval theology which finds its dogma of hereditary\r\ndepravity in the doctrine of psora, its miracle of transubstantiation in\r\nthe mystery of its triturations and dilutions, its church in the people\r\nwho have mistaken their century, and its priests in those who have\r\nmistaken their calling. You can do little with persons who are disposed\r\nto accept these curious medical superstitions. The saturation-point\r\nof individual minds with reference to evidence, and especially medical\r\nevidence, differs, and must always continue to differ, very widely.\r\nThere are those whose minds are satisfied with the decillionth dilution\r\nof a scientific proof. No wonder they believe in the efficacy of a\r\nsimilar attenuation of bryony or pulsatilla. You have no fulcrum you\r\ncan rest upon to lift an error out of such minds as these, often highly\r\nendowed with knowledge and talent, sometimes with genius, but commonly\r\nricher in the imaginative than the observing and reasoning faculties.\r\n\r\nLet me return once more to the young graduate. Your relations to your\r\nprofessional brethren may be a source of lifelong happiness and growth\r\nin knowledge and character, or they may make you wretched and end\r\nby leaving you isolated from those who should be your friends and\r\ncounsellors. The life of a physician becomes ignoble when he suffers\r\nhimself to feed on petty jealousies and sours his temper in perpetual\r\nquarrels. You will be liable to meet an uncomfortable man here and there\r\nin the profession,--one who is so fond of being in hot water that it is\r\na wonder all the albumen in his body is not coagulated. There are common\r\nbarrators among doctors as there are among lawyers,--stirrers up of\r\nstrife under one pretext and another, but in reality because they like\r\nit. They are their own worst enemies, and do themselves a mischief each\r\ntime they assail their neighbors. In my student days I remember a good\r\ndeal of this Donnybrook-Fair style of quarrelling, more especially in\r\nParis, where some of the noted surgeons were always at loggerheads, and\r\nin one of our lively Western cities. Soon after I had set up an office,\r\nI had a trifling experience which may serve to point a moral in this\r\ndirection. I had placed a lamp behind the glass in the entry to indicate\r\nto the passer-by where relief from all curable infirmities was to be\r\nsought and found. Its brilliancy attracted the attention of a devious\r\nyouth, who dashed his fist through the glass and upset my modest\r\nluminary. All he got by his vivacious assault was that he left portions\r\nof integument from his knuckles upon the glass, had a lame hand, was\r\nvery easily identified, and had to pay the glazier's bill. The moral is\r\nthat, if the brilliancy of another's reputation excites your belligerent\r\ninstincts, it is not worth your while to strike at it, without\r\ncalculating which of you is likely to suffer most, if you do.\r\n\r\nYou may be assured that when an ill-conditioned neighbor is always\r\ncomplaining of a bad taste in his mouth and an evil atmosphere about\r\nhim, there is something wrong about his own secretions. In such\r\ncases there is an alterative regimen of remarkable efficacy: it is a\r\nstarvation-diet of letting alone. The great majority of the profession\r\nare peacefully inclined. Their pursuits are eminently humanizing, and\r\nthey look with disgust on the personalities which intrude themselves\r\ninto the placid domain of an art whose province it is to heal and not to\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nThe intercourse of teacher and student in a large school is necessarily\r\nlimited, but it should be, and, so far as my experience goes, it is,\r\neminently cordial and kindly. You will leave with regret, and hold\r\nin tender remembrance, those who have taken you by the hand at your\r\nentrance on your chosen path, and led you patiently and faithfully,\r\nuntil the great gates at its end have swung upon their hinges, and the\r\nworld lies open before you. That venerable oath to which I have before\r\nreferred bound the student to regard his instructor in the light of a\r\nparent, to treat his children like brothers, to succor him in his day of\r\nneed. I trust the spirit of the oath of Hippocrates is not dead in the\r\nhearts of the students of to-day. They will remember with gratitude\r\nevery earnest effort, every encouraging word, which has helped them in\r\ntheir difficult and laborious career of study. The names they read on\r\ntheir diplomas will recall faces that are like family-portraits in their\r\nmemory, and the echo of voices they have listened to so long will linger\r\nin their memories far into the still evening of their lives.\r\n\r\nOne voice will be heard no more which has been familiar to many among\r\nyou. It is not for me, a stranger to these scenes, to speak his eulogy.\r\nI have no right to sadden this hour by dwelling on the deep regrets\r\nof friendship, or to bid the bitter tears of sorrow flow afresh. Yet I\r\ncannot help remembering what a void the death of such a practitioner as\r\nyour late instructor must leave in the wide circle of those who leaned\r\nupon his counsel and assistance in their hour of need, in a community\r\nwhere he was so widely known and esteemed, in a school where he bore so\r\nimportant a part. There is no exemption from the common doom for him\r\nwho holds the shield to protect others. The student is called from his\r\nbench, the professor from his chair, the practitioner in his busiest\r\nperiod hears a knock more peremptory than any patient's midnight\r\nsummons, and goes on that unreturning visit which admits of no excuse,\r\nand suffers no delay. The call of such a man away from us is the\r\nbereavement of a great family. Nor can we help regretting the loss\r\nfor him of a bright and cheerful earthly future; for the old age of a\r\nphysician is one of the happiest periods of his life. He is loved and\r\ncherished for what he has been, and even in the decline of his faculties\r\nthere are occasions when his experience is still appealed to, and his\r\ntrembling hands are looked to with renewing hope and trust, as being yet\r\nable to stay the arm of the destroyer.\r\n\r\nBut if there is so much left for age, how beautiful, how inspiring is\r\nthe hope of youth! I see among those whom I count as listeners one by\r\nwhose side I have sat as a fellow-teacher, and by whose instructions\r\nI have felt myself not too old to profit. As we borrowed him from\r\nyour city, I must take this opportunity of telling you that his zeal,\r\nintelligence, and admirable faculty as an instructor were heartily and\r\nuniversally recognized among us. We return him, as we trust, uninjured,\r\nto the fellow-citizens who have the privilege of claiming him as their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentlemen of the graduating class, nothing remains but for\r\nme to bid you, in the name of those for whom I am commissioned and\r\nprivileged to speak, farewell as students, and welcome as practitioners.\r\nI pronounce the two benedictions in the same breath, as the late king's\r\ndemise and the new king's accession are proclaimed by the same voice at\r\nthe same moment. You would hardly excuse me if I stooped to any meaner\r\ndialect than the classical and familiar language of your prescriptions,\r\nthe same in which your title to the name of physician is, if, like\r\nour own institution, you follow the ancient usage, engraved upon your\r\ndiplomas.\r\n\r\nValete, JUVENES, artis medicae studiosi; valete, discipuli, valete,\r\nfilii!\r\n\r\nSalvete, VIRI, artis medicae magister; Salvete amici; salvete fratres!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\n[Dedicatory Address at the opening of the Medical Library in Boston,\r\nDecember 3, 1878.]\r\n\r\nIt is my appointed task, my honorable privilege, this evening, to speak\r\nof what has been done by others. No one can bring his tribute of words\r\ninto the presence of great deeds, or try with them to embellish the\r\nmemory of any inspiring achievement, without feeling and leaving\r\nwith others a sense of their insufficiency. So felt Alexander when he\r\ncompared even his adored Homer with the hero the poet had sung. So felt\r\nWebster when he contrasted the phrases of rhetoric with the eloquence\r\nof patriotism and of self-devotion. So felt Lincoln when on the field of\r\nGettysburg he spoke those immortal words which Pericles could not have\r\nbettered, which Aristotle could not have criticised. So felt he who\r\nwrote the epitaph of the builder of the dome which looks down on the\r\ncrosses and weathercocks that glitter over London.\r\n\r\nWe are not met upon a battle-field, except so far as every laborious\r\nachievement means a victory over opposition, indifference, selfishness,\r\nfaintheartedness, and that great property of mind as well as\r\nmatter,--inertia. We are not met in a cathedral, except so far as every\r\nbuilding whose walls are lined with the products of useful and ennobling\r\nthought is a temple of the Almighty, whose inspiration has given us\r\nunderstanding. But we have gathered within walls which bear testimony to\r\nthe self-sacrificing, persevering efforts of a few young men, to whom\r\nwe owe the origin and development of all that excites our admiration in\r\nthis completed enterprise; and I might consider my task as finished if I\r\ncontented myself with borrowing the last word of the architect's epitaph\r\nand only saying, Look around you!\r\n\r\nThe reports of the librarian have told or will tell you, in some detail,\r\nwhat has been accomplished since the 21st of December, 1874, when six\r\ngentlemen met at the house of Dr. Henry Ingersoll Bowditch to discuss\r\ndifferent projects for a medical library. In less than four years from\r\nthat time, by the liberality of associations and of individuals, this\r\ncollection of nearly ten thousand volumes, of five thousand pamphlets,\r\nand of one hundred and twenty-five journals, regularly received,--all\r\nworthily sheltered beneath this lofty roof,--has come into being under\r\nour eyes. It has sprung up, as it were, in the night like a mushroom; it\r\nstands before us in full daylight as lusty as an oak, and promising to\r\ngrow and flourish in the perennial freshness of an evergreen.\r\n\r\nTo whom does our profession owe this already large collection of books,\r\nexceeded in numbers only by four or five of the most extensive medical\r\nlibraries in the country, and lodged in a building so well adapted to\r\nits present needs? We will not point out individually all those younger\r\nmembers of the profession who have accomplished what their fathers and\r\nelder brethren had attempted and partially achieved. We need not write\r\ntheir names on these walls, after the fashion of those civic dignitaries\r\nwho immortalize themselves on tablets of marble and gates of iron. But\r\ntheir contemporaries know them well, and their descendants will not\r\nforget them,--the men who first met together, the men who have given\r\ntheir time and their money, the faithful workers, worthy associates of\r\nthe strenuous agitator who gave no sleep to his eyes, no slumber to\r\nhis eyelids, until he had gained his ends; the untiring, imperturbable,\r\ntenacious, irrepressible, all-subduing agitator who neither rested\r\nnor let others rest until the success of the project was assured. If,\r\nagainst his injunctions, I name Dr. James Read Chadwick, it is only my\r\nrevenge for his having kept me awake so often and so long while he was\r\nurging on the undertaking in which he has been preeminently active and\r\ntriumphantly successful.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget the various medical libraries which preceded this:\r\nthat of an earlier period, when Boston contained about seventy regular\r\npractitioners, the collection afterwards transferred to the Boston\r\nAthenaeum; the two collections belonging to the University; the\r\nTreadwell Library at the Massachusetts General Hospital; the collections\r\nof the two societies, that for Medical Improvement and that for Medical\r\nObservation; and more especially the ten thousand volumes relating to\r\nmedicine belonging to our noble public city library,--too many blossoms\r\non the tree of knowledge, perhaps, for the best fruit to ripen. But the\r\nMassachusetts Medical Society now numbers nearly four hundred members in\r\nthe city of Boston. The time had arrived for a new and larger movement.\r\nThere was needed a place to which every respectable member of the\r\nmedical profession could obtain easy access; where, under one roof, all\r\nmight find the special information they were seeking; where the latest\r\nmedical intelligence should be spread out daily as the shipping news is\r\nposted on the bulletins of the exchange; where men engaged in a common\r\npursuit could meet, surrounded by the mute oracles of science and art;\r\nwhere the whole atmosphere should be as full of professional knowledge\r\nas the apothecary's shop is of the odor of his medicaments. This was\r\nwhat the old men longed for,--the prophets and kings of the profession,\r\nwho\r\n\r\n\r\n        “Desired it long,\r\n   But died without the sight.”\r\n\r\nThis is what the young men and those who worked under their guidance\r\nundertook to give us. And now such a library, such a reading-room, such\r\nan exchange, such an intellectual and social meeting place, we behold a\r\nfact, plain before us. The medical profession of our city, and, let us\r\nadd, of all those neighboring places which it can reach with its iron\r\narms, is united as never before by the commune vinculum, the common bond\r\nof a large, enduring, ennobling, unselfish interest. It breathes a new\r\nair of awakened intelligence. It marches abreast of the other\r\nlearned professions, which have long had their extensive and valuable\r\ncentralized libraries; abreast of them, but not promising to be content\r\nwith that position. What glorifies a town like a cathedral? What\r\ndignifies a province like a university? What illuminates a country\r\nlike its scholarship, and what is the nest that hatches scholars but a\r\nlibrary?\r\n\r\nThe physician, some may say, is a practical man and has little use for\r\nall this book-learning. Every student has heard Sydenham's reply to Sir\r\nRichard Blackmore's question as to what books he should read,--meaning\r\nmedical books. “Read Don Quixote,” was his famous answer. But Sydenham\r\nhimself made medical books and may be presumed to have thought those at\r\nleast worth reading. Descartes was asked where was his library, and in\r\nreply held up the dissected body of an animal. But Descartes made books,\r\ngreat books, and a great many of them. A physician of common sense\r\nwithout erudition is better than a learned one without common sense, but\r\nthe thorough master of his profession must have learning added to his\r\nnatural gifts.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to maintain the direct practical utility of all\r\nkinds of learning. Our shelves contain many books which only a certain\r\nclass of medical scholars will be likely to consult. There is a dead\r\nmedical literature, and there is a live one. The dead is not all\r\nancient, the live is not all modern. There is none, modern or ancient,\r\nwhich, if it has no living value for the student, will not teach him\r\nsomething by its autopsy. But it is with the live literature of his\r\nprofession that the medical practitioner is first of all concerned.\r\n\r\nNow there has come a great change in our time over the form in\r\nwhich living thought presents itself. The first printed books,--the\r\nincunabula,--were inclosed in boards of solid oak, with brazen clasps\r\nand corners; the boards by and by were replaced by pasteboard covered\r\nwith calf or sheepskin; then cloth came in and took the place of\r\nleather; then the pasteboard was covered with paper instead of cloth;\r\nand at this day the quarterly, the monthly, the weekly periodical in its\r\nflimsy unsupported dress of paper, and the daily journal, naked as\r\nit came from the womb of the press, hold the larger part of the fresh\r\nreading we live upon. We must have the latest thought in its latest\r\nexpression; the page must be newly turned like the morning bannock; the\r\npamphlet must be newly opened like the ante-prandial oyster.\r\n\r\nThus a library, to meet the need of our time, must take, and must spread\r\nout in a convenient form, a great array of periodicals. Our active\r\npractitioners read these by preference over almost everything else. Our\r\nspecialists, more particularly, depend on the month's product, on the\r\nyearly crop of new facts, new suggestions, new contrivances, as much\r\nas the farmer on the annual yield of his acres. One of the first wants,\r\nthen, of the profession is supplied by our library in its great array of\r\nperiodicals from many lands, in many languages. Such a number of medical\r\nperiodicals no private library would have room for, no private person\r\nwould pay for, or flood his tables with if they were sent him for\r\nnothing. These, I think, with the reports of medical societies and the\r\npapers contributed to them, will form the most attractive part of\r\nour accumulated medical treasures. They will be also one of our chief\r\nexpenses, for these journals must be bound in volumes and they require\r\na great amount of shelf-room; all this, in addition to the cost of\r\nsubscription for those which are not furnished us gratuitously.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the value of old scientific periodicals is, other things\r\nbeing equal, in the inverse ratio of their age, for the obvious reason\r\nthat what is most valuable in the earlier volumes of a series is drained\r\noff into the standard works with which the intelligent practitioner is\r\nsupposed to be familiar. But no extended record of facts grows too old\r\nto be useful, provided only that we have a ready and sure way of getting\r\nat the particular fact or facts we are in search of.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads me to speak of what I conceive to be one of the principal\r\ntasks to be performed by the present and the coming generation of\r\nscholars, not only in the medical, but in every department of knowledge.\r\nI mean the formation of indexes, and more especially of indexes to\r\nperiodical literature.\r\n\r\nThis idea has long been working in the minds of scholars, and all who\r\nhave had occasion to follow out any special subject. I have a right to\r\nspeak of it, for I long ago attempted to supply the want of indexes in\r\nsome small measure for my own need. I had a very complete set of the\r\n“American Journal of the Medical Sciences;” an entire set of the “North\r\nAmerican Review,” and many volumes of the reprints of the three leading\r\nBritish quarterlies. Of what use were they to me without general\r\nindexes? I looked them all through carefully and made classified lists\r\nof all the articles I thought I should most care to read. But they soon\r\noutgrew my lists. The “North American Review” kept filling up shelf\r\nafter shelf, rich in articles which I often wanted to consult, but what\r\na labor to find them, until the index of Mr. Gushing, published a few\r\nmonths since, made the contents of these hundred and twenty volumes as\r\neasily accessible as the words in a dictionary! I had a copy of good Dr.\r\nAbraham Rees's Cyclopaedia, a treasure-house to my boyhood which has\r\nnot lost its value for me in later years. But where to look for what I\r\nwanted? I wished to know, for instance, what Dr. Burney had to say about\r\nsinging. Who would have looked for it under the Italian word cantare? I\r\nwas curious to learn something of the etchings of Rembrandt, and\r\nwhere should I find it but under the head “Low Countries, Engravers\r\nof the,”--an elaborate and most valuable article of a hundred\r\ndouble-columned close-printed quarto pages, to which no reference, even,\r\nis made under the title Rembrandt.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be done, if I wanted to know where that which I\r\nspecially cared for was to be found in my Rees's Cyclopaedia, but to\r\nlook over every page of its forty-one quarto volumes and make out\r\na brief list of matters of interest which I could not find by their\r\ntitles, and this I did, at no small expense of time and trouble.\r\n\r\nNothing, therefore, could be more pleasing to me than to see the\r\nattention which has been given of late years to the great work of\r\nindexing. It is a quarter of a century since Mr. Poole published his\r\n“Index to Periodical Literature,” which it is much to be hoped is soon\r\nto appear in a new edition, grown as it must be to formidable dimensions\r\nby the additions of so long a period. The “British and Foreign Medical\r\nReview,” edited by the late Sir John Forties, contributed to by Huxley,\r\nCarpenter, Laycock, and others of the most distinguished scientific men\r\nof Great Britain, has an index to its twenty-four volumes, and by its\r\naid I find this valuable series as manageable as a lexicon. The last\r\nedition of the “Encyclopaedia Britannica” had a complete index in a\r\nseparate volume, and the publishers of Appletons' “American Cyclopaedia”\r\n have recently issued an index to their useful work, which must greatly\r\nadd to its value. I have already referred to the index to the “North\r\nAmerican Review,” which to an American, and especially to a New\r\nEnglander, is the most interesting and most valuable addition of its\r\nkind to our literary apparatus since the publication of Mr. Allibone's\r\n“Dictionary of Authors.” I might almost dare to parody Mr. Webster's\r\nwords in speaking of Hamilton, to describe what Mr. Gushing did for the\r\nsolemn rows of back volumes of our honored old Review which had been\r\nlong fossilizing on our shelves: “He touched the dead corpse of the\r\n'North American,' and it sprang to its feet.” A library of the best\r\nthought of the best American scholars during the greater portion of the\r\ncentury was brought to light by the work of the indexmaker as truly as\r\nwere the Assyrian tablets by the labors of Layard.\r\n\r\nA great portion of the best writing and reading--literary, scientific,\r\nprofessional, miscellaneous--comes to us now, at stated intervals, in\r\npaper covers. The writer appears, as it were, in his shirt-sleeves. As\r\nsoon as he has delivered his message the book-binder puts a coat on\r\nhis back, and he joins the forlorn brotherhood of “back volumes,” than\r\nwhich, so long as they are unindexed, nothing can be more exasperating.\r\nWho wants a lock without a key, a ship without a rudder, a binnacle\r\nwithout a compass, a check without a signature, a greenback without a\r\ngoldback behind it?\r\n\r\nI have referred chiefly to the medical journals, but I would include\r\nwith these the reports of medical associations, and those separate\r\npublications which, coming in the form of pamphlets, heap themselves\r\ninto chaotic piles and bundles which are worse than useless, taking up a\r\ngreat deal of room, and frightening everything away but mice and mousing\r\nantiquarians, or possibly at long intervals some terebrating specialist.\r\n\r\nArranged, bound, indexed, all these at once become accessible and\r\nvaluable. I will take the first instance which happens to suggest\r\nitself. How many who know all about osteoblasts and the experiments of\r\nOllier, and all that has grown out of them, know where to go for a paper\r\nby the late Dr. A. L. Peirson of Salem, published in the year 1840,\r\nunder the modest title, Remarks on Fractures? And if any practitioner\r\nwho has to deal with broken bones does not know that most excellent\r\nand practical essay, it is a great pity, for it answers very numerous\r\nquestions which will be sure to suggest themselves to the surgeon and\r\nthe patient as no one of the recent treatises, on my own shelves, at\r\nleast, can do.\r\n\r\nBut if indexing is the special need of our time in medical literature,\r\nas in every department of knowledge, it must be remembered that it\r\nis not only an immense labor, but one that never ends. It requires,\r\ntherefore, the cooperation of a large number of individuals to do the\r\nwork, and a large amount of money to pay for making its results public\r\nthrough the press. When it is remembered that the catalogue of the\r\nlibrary of the British Museum is contained in nearly three thousand\r\nlarge folios of manuscript, and not all its books are yet included, the\r\ntask of indexing any considerable branch of science or literature looks\r\nas if it were well nigh impossible. But many hands make light work. An\r\n“Index Society” has been formed in England, already numbering about one\r\nhundred and seventy members. It aims at “supplying thorough indexes\r\nto valuable works and collections which have hitherto lacked them; at\r\nissuing indexes to the literature of special subjects; and at gathering\r\nmaterials for a general reference index.” This society has published a\r\nlittle treatise setting forth the history and the art of indexing, which\r\nI trust is in the hands of some of our members, if not upon our shelves.\r\n\r\nSomething has been done in the same direction by individuals in our own\r\ncountry, as we have already seen. The need of it in the department of\r\nmedicine is beginning to be clearly felt. Our library has already an\r\nadmirable catalogue with cross references, the work of a number of its\r\nyounger members cooperating in the task. A very intelligent medical\r\nstudent, Mr. William D. Chapin, whose excellent project is indorsed by\r\nwell-known New York physicians and professors, proposes to publish a\r\nyearly index to original communications in the medical journals of the\r\nUnited States, classified by authors and subjects. But it is from the\r\nNational Medical Library at Washington that we have the best promise\r\nand the largest expectations. That great and growing collection of fifty\r\nthousand volumes is under the eye and hand of a librarian who knows\r\nbooks and how to manage them. For libraries are the standing armies\r\nof civilization, and an army is but a mob without a general who can\r\norganize and marshal it so as to make it effective. The “Specimen\r\nFasciculus of a Catalogue of the National Medical Library,” prepared\r\nunder the direction of Dr. Billings, the librarian, would have excited\r\nthe admiration of Haller, the master scholar in medical science of\r\nthe last century, or rather of the profession in all centuries, and if\r\ncarried out as it is begun will be to the nineteenth all and more\r\nthan all that the three Bibliothecae--Anatomica, Chirurgica, and\r\nMedicinae-Practicae--were to the eighteenth century. I cannot forget\r\nthe story that Agassiz was so fond of telling of the king of Prussia and\r\nFichte. It was after the humiliation and spoliation of the kingdom by\r\nNapoleon that the monarch asked the philosopher what could be done\r\nto regain the lost position of the nation. “Found a great university,\r\nSire,” was the answer, and so it was that in the year 1810 the\r\nworld-renowned University of Berlin came into being. I believe that we\r\nin this country can do better than found a national university, whose\r\nprofessors shall be nominated in caucuses, go in and out, perhaps, like\r\npostmasters, with every change of administration, and deal with science\r\nin the face of their constituency as the courtier did with time when\r\nhis sovereign asked him what o'clock it was: “Whatever hour your majesty\r\npleases.” But when we have a noble library like that at Washington, and\r\na librarian of exceptional qualifications like the gentleman who now\r\nholds that office, I believe that a liberal appropriation by Congress\r\nto carry out a conscientious work for the advancement of sound knowledge\r\nand the bettering of human conditions, like this which Dr. Billings\r\nhas so well begun, would redound greatly to the honor of the nation. It\r\nought to be willing to be at some charge to make its treasures useful to\r\nits citizens, and, for its own sake, especially to that class which has\r\ncharge of health, public and private. This country abounds in what\r\nare called “self-made men,” and is justly proud of many whom it thus\r\ndesignates. In one sense no man is self-made who breathes the air of a\r\ncivilized community. In another sense every man who is anything other\r\nthan a phonograph on legs is self-made. But if we award his just praise\r\nto the man who has attained any kind of excellence without having had\r\nthe same advantages as others whom, nevertheless, he has equalled or\r\nsurpassed, let us not be betrayed into undervaluing the mechanic's\r\ncareful training to his business, the thorough and laborious education\r\nof the scholar and the professional man.\r\n\r\nOur American atmosphere is vocal with the flippant loquacity of half\r\nknowledge. We must accept whatever good can be got out of it, and keep\r\nit under as we do sorrel and mullein and witchgrass, by enriching the\r\nsoil, and sowing good seed in plenty; by good teaching and good books,\r\nrather than by wasting our time in talking against it. Half knowledge\r\ndreads nothing but whole knowledge.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the importance and the predominance of periodical\r\nliterature, and have attempted to do justice to its value. But the\r\nalmost exclusive reading of it is not without its dangers. The journals\r\ncontain much that is crude and unsound; the presumption, it might be\r\nmaintained, is against their novelties, unless they come from observers\r\nof established credit. Yet I have known a practitioner,--perhaps more\r\nthan one,--who was as much under the dominant influence of the last\r\narticle he had read in his favorite medical journal as a milliner under\r\nthe sway of the last fashion-plate. The difference between green and\r\nseasoned knowledge is very great, and such practitioners never hold long\r\nenough to any of their knowledge to have it get seasoned.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say, then, that all the substantial and permanent\r\nliterature of the profession should be represented upon our shelves.\r\nMuch of it is there already, and as one private library after another\r\nfalls into this by the natural law of gravitation, it will gradually\r\nacquire all that is most valuable almost without effort. A scholar\r\nshould not be in a hurry to part with his books. They are probably\r\nmore valuable to him than they can be to any other individual. What\r\nSwedenborg called “correspondence” has established itself between\r\nhis intelligence and the volumes which wall him within their sacred\r\ninclosure. Napoleon said that his mind was as if furnished with\r\ndrawers,--he drew out each as he wanted its contents, and closed it\r\nat will when done with them. The scholar's mind, to use a similar\r\ncomparison, is furnished with shelves, like his library. Each book knows\r\nits place in the brain as well as against the wall or in the alcove. His\r\nconsciousness is doubled by the books which encircle him, as the trees\r\nthat surround a lake repeat themselves in its unruffled waters. Men talk\r\nof the nerve that runs to the pocket, but one who loves his books, and\r\nhas lived long with them, has a nervous filament which runs from his\r\nsensorium to every one of them. Or, if I may still let my fancy draw\r\nits pictures, a scholar's library is to him what a temple is to the\r\nworshipper who frequents it. There is the altar sacred to his holiest\r\nexperiences. There is the font where his new-born thought was baptized\r\nand first had a name in his consciousness. There is the monumental\r\ntablet of a dead belief, sacred still in the memory of what it was while\r\nyet alive. No visitor can read all this on the lettered backs of the\r\nbooks that have gathered around the scholar, but for him, from the Aldus\r\non the lowest shelf to the Elzevir on the highest, every volume has\r\na language which none but he can interpret. Be patient with the\r\nbook-collector who loves his companions too well to let them go. Books\r\nare not buried with their owners, and the veriest book-miser that ever\r\nlived was probably doing far more for his successors than his more\r\nliberal neighbor who despised his learned or unlearned avarice. Let\r\nthe fruit fall with the leaves still clinging round it. Who would have\r\nstripped Southey's walls of the books that filled them, when, his mind\r\nno longer capable of taking in their meaning, he would still pat and\r\nfondle them with the vague loving sense of what they had once been\r\nto him,--to him, the great scholar, now like a little child among his\r\nplaythings?\r\n\r\nWe need in this country not only the scholar, but the virtuoso, who\r\nhoards the treasures which he loves, it may be chiefly for their rarity\r\nand because others who know more than he does of their value set a high\r\nprice upon them. As the wine of old vintages is gently decanted out\r\nof its cobwebbed bottles with their rotten corks into clean new\r\nreceptacles, so the wealth of the New World is quietly emptying many\r\nof the libraries and galleries of the Old World into its newly formed\r\ncollections and newly raised edifices. And this process must go on in an\r\naccelerating ratio. No Englishman will be offended if I say that before\r\nthe New Zealander takes his stand on a broken arch of London Bridge\r\nto sketch the ruins of St. Paul's in the midst of a vast solitude, the\r\ntreasures of the British Museum will have found a new shelter in the\r\nhalls of New York or Boston. No Catholic will think hardly of my saying\r\nthat before the Coliseum falls, and with it the imperial city, whose\r\ndoom prophecy has linked with that of the almost eternal amphitheatre,\r\nthe marbles, the bronzes, the paintings, the manuscripts of the Vatican\r\nwill have left the shores of the Tiber for those of the Potomac, the\r\nHudson, the Mississippi, or the Sacramento. And what a delight in the\r\npursuit of the rarities which the eager book-hunter follows with the\r\nscent of a beagle!\r\n\r\nShall I ever forget that rainy day in Lyons, that dingy bookshop, where\r\nI found the Aetius, long missing from my Artis bledicae Principes, and\r\nwhere I bought for a small pecuniary consideration, though it was marked\r\nrare, and was really tres rare, the Aphorisms of Hippocrates, edited\r\nby and with a preface from the hand of Francis Rabelais? And the\r\nvellum-bound Tulpius, which I came upon in Venice, afterwards my only\r\nreading when imprisoned in quarantine at Marseilles, so that the two\r\nhundred and twenty-eight cases he has recorded are, many of them, to\r\nthis day still fresh in my memory. And the Schenckius,--the folio filled\r\nwith casus rariores, which had strayed in among the rubbish of the\r\nbookstall on the boulevard,--and the noble old Vesalius with its grand\r\nfrontispiece not unworthy of Titian, and the fine old Ambroise Pare,\r\nlong waited for even in Paris and long ago, and the colossal Spigelius\r\nwith his eviscerated beauties, and Dutch Bidloo with its miracles of\r\nfine engraving and bad dissection, and Italian Mascagni, the despair of\r\nall would-be imitators, and pre-Adamite John de Ketam, and antediluvian\r\nBerengarius Carpensis,--but why multiply names, every one of which\r\nbrings back the accession of a book which was an event almost like the\r\nbirth of an infant?\r\n\r\nA library like ours must exercise the largest hospitality. A great many\r\nbooks may be found in every large collection which remind us of those\r\napostolic looking old men who figure on the platform at our political\r\nand other assemblages. Some of them have spoken words of wisdom in their\r\nday, but they have ceased to be oracles; some of them never had any\r\nparticularly important message for humanity, but they add dignity to the\r\nmeeting by their presence; they look wise, whether they are so or not,\r\nand no one grudges them their places of honor. Venerable figure-heads,\r\nwhat would our platforms be without you?\r\n\r\nJust so with our libraries. Without their rows of folios in creamy\r\nvellum, or showing their black backs with antique lettering of tarnished\r\ngold, our shelves would look as insufficient and unbalanced as a column\r\nwithout its base, as a statue without its pedestal. And do not think\r\nthey are kept only to be spanked and dusted during that dreadful period\r\nwhen their owner is but too thankful to become an exile and a wanderer\r\nfrom the scene of single combats between dead authors and living\r\nhousemaids. Men were not all cowards before Agamemnon or all fools\r\nbefore the days of Virchow and Billroth. And apart from any practical\r\nuse to be derived from the older medical authors, is there not a true\r\npleasure in reading the accounts of great discoverers in their own\r\nwords? I do not pretend to hoist up the Bibliotheca Anatomica of\r\nMangetus and spread it on my table every day. I do not get out my great\r\nAlbinus before every lecture on the muscles, nor disturb the majestic\r\nrepose of Vesalius every time I speak of the bones he has so admirably\r\ndescribed and figured. But it does please me to read the first\r\ndescriptions of parts to which the names of their discoverers or those\r\nwho have first described them have become so joined that not even modern\r\nscience can part them; to listen to the talk of my old volume as Willis\r\ndescribes his circle and Fallopius his aqueduct and Varolius his bridge\r\nand Eustachius his tube and Monro his foramen,--all so well known to\r\nus in the human body; it does please me to know the very words in which\r\nWinslow described the opening which bears his name, and Glisson his\r\ncapsule and De Graaf his vesicle; I am not content until I know in what\r\nlanguage Harvey announced his discovery of the circulation, and how\r\nSpigelius made the liver his perpetual memorial, and Malpighi found a\r\nmonument more enduring than brass in the corpuscles of the spleen and\r\nthe kidney.\r\n\r\nBut after all, the readers who care most for the early records of\r\nmedical science and art are the specialists who are dividing up the\r\npractice of medicine and surgery as they were parcelled out, according\r\nto Herodotus, by the Egyptians. For them nothing is too old, nothing is\r\ntoo new, for to their books of all others is applicable the saying of\r\nD'Alembert that the author kills himself in lengthening out what the\r\nreader kills himself in trying to shorten.\r\n\r\nThere are practical books among these ancient volumes which can never\r\ngrow old. Would you know how to recognize “male hysteria” and to\r\ntreat it, take down your Sydenham; would you read the experience of\r\na physician who was himself the subject of asthma, and who,\r\nnotwithstanding that, in the words of Dr. Johnson, “panted on till\r\nninety,” you will find it in the venerable treatise of Sir John Floyer;\r\nwould you listen to the story of the King's Evil cured by the royal\r\ntouch, as told by a famous chirurgeon who fully believed in it, go\r\nto Wiseman; would you get at first hand the description of the spinal\r\ndisease which long bore his name, do not be startled if I tell you to go\r\nto Pott,--to Percival Pott, the great surgeon of the last century.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time for every book in a library when it is wanted\r\nby somebody. It is but a few weeks since one of the most celebrated\r\nphysicians in the country wrote to me from a great centre of medical\r\neducation to know if I had the works of Sanctorius, which he had tried\r\nin vain to find. I could have lent him the “Medicina Statica,” with its\r\nfrontispiece showing Sanctorius with his dinner on the table before\r\nhim, in his balanced chair which sunk with him below the level of his\r\nbanquet-board when he had swallowed a certain number of ounces,--an\r\nearly foreshadowing of Pettenkofer's chamber and quantitative\r\nphysiology,--but the “Opera Omnia” of Sanctorius I had never met with,\r\nand I fear he had to do without it.\r\n\r\nI would extend the hospitality of these shelves to a class of works\r\nwhich we are in the habit of considering as being outside of the pale\r\nof medical science, properly so called, and sometimes of coupling with\r\na disrespectful name. Such has always been my own practice. I have\r\nwelcomed Culpeper and Salmon to my bookcase as willingly as Dioscorides\r\nor Quincy, or Paris or Wood and Bache. I have found a place for St.\r\nJohn Long, and read the story of his trial for manslaughter with as\r\nmuch interest as the laurel-water case in which John Hunter figured as\r\na witness. I would give Samuel Hahnemann a place by the side of Samuel\r\nThomson. Am I not afraid that some student of imaginative turn and\r\nnot provided with the needful cerebral strainers without which all the\r\nrefuse of gimcrack intelligences gets into the mental drains and chokes\r\nthem up,--am I not afraid that some such student will get hold of\r\nthe “Organon” or the “Maladies Chroniques” and be won over by their\r\ndelusions, and so be lost to those that love him as a man of common\r\nsense and a brother in their high calling? Not in the least. If he\r\nshowed any symptoms of infection I would for once have recourse to\r\nthe principle of similia similibus. To cure him of Hahnemann I would\r\nprescribe my favorite homoeopathic antidote, Okie's Bonninghausen.\r\nIf that failed, I would order Grauvogl as a heroic remedy, and if he\r\nsurvived that uncured, I would give him my blessing, if I thought\r\nhim honest, and bid him depart in peace. For me he is no longer an\r\nindividual. He belongs to a class of minds which we are bound to be\r\npatient with if their Maker sees fit to indulge them with existence. We\r\nmust accept the conjuring ultra-ritualist, the dreamy second adventist,\r\nthe erratic spiritualist, the fantastic homoeopathist, as not unworthy\r\nof philosophic study; not more unworthy of it than the squarers of the\r\ncircle and the inventors of perpetual motion, and the other whimsical\r\nvisionaries to whom De Morgan has devoted his most instructive and\r\nentertaining “Budget of Paradoxes.” I hope, therefore, that our library\r\nwill admit the works of the so-called Eclectics, of the Thomsonians, if\r\nany are in existence, of the Clairvoyants, if they have a literature,\r\nand especially of the Homoeopathists. This country seems to be the place\r\nfor such a collection, which will by and by be curious and of more value\r\nthan at present, for Homoeopathy seems to be following the pathological\r\nlaw of erysipelas, fading out where it originated as it spreads to new\r\nregions. At least I judge so by the following translated extract from\r\na criticism of an American work in the “Homoeopatische Rundschau” of\r\nLeipzig for October, 1878, which I find in the “Homoeopathic Bulletin”\r\n for the month of November just passed: “While we feel proud of\r\nthe spread and rise of Homoeopathy across the ocean, and while the\r\nHomoeopathic works reaching us from there, and published in a style\r\nsuch as is unknown in Germany, bear eloquent testimony to the eminent\r\nactivity of our transatlantic colleagues, we are overcome by sorrowful\r\nregrets at the position Homoeopathy occupies in Germany. Such a work [as\r\nthe American one referred to] with us would be impossible; it would lack\r\nthe necessary support.”\r\n\r\nBy all means let our library secure a good representation of the\r\nliterature of Homoeopathy before it leaves us its “sorrowful regrets”\r\n and migrates with its sugar of milk pellets, which have taken the place\r\nof the old pilulae micae panis, to Alaska, to “Nova Zembla, or the Lord\r\nknows where.”\r\n\r\nWhat shall I say in this presence of the duties of a Librarian? Where\r\nhave they ever been better performed than in our own public city\r\nlibrary, where the late Mr. Jewett and the living Mr. Winsor have shown\r\nus what a librarian ought to be,--the organizing head, the vigilant\r\nguardian, the seeker's index, the scholar's counsellor? His work is not\r\nmerely that of administration, manifold and laborious as its duties are.\r\nHe must have a quick intelligence and a retentive memory. He is a\r\npublic carrier of knowledge in its germs. His office is like that which\r\nnaturalists attribute to the bumble-bee,--he lays up little honey for\r\nhimself, but he conveys the fertilizing pollen from flower to flower.\r\n\r\nOur undertaking, just completed,--and just begun--has come at the right\r\ntime, not a day too soon. Our practitioners need a library like this,\r\nfor with all their skill and devotion there is too little genuine\r\nerudition, such as a liberal profession ought to be able to claim for\r\nmany of its members. In reading the recent obituary notices of the late\r\nDr. Geddings of South Carolina, I recalled what our lamented friend Dr.\r\nCoale used to tell me of his learning and accomplishments, and I could\r\nnot help reflecting how few such medical scholars we had to show in\r\nBoston or New England. We must clear up this unilluminated atmosphere,\r\nand here,--here is the true electric light which will irradiate its\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe public will catch the rays reflected from the same source of\r\nlight, and it needs instruction on the great subjects of health and\r\ndisease,--needs it sadly. It is preyed upon by every kind of imposition\r\nalmost without hindrance. Its ignorance and prejudices react upon\r\nthe profession to the great injury of both. The jealous feeling, for\r\ninstance, with regard to such provisions for the study of anatomy as are\r\nsanctioned by the laws in this State and carried out with strict\r\nregard to those laws, threatens the welfare, if not the existence of\r\ninstitutions for medical instruction wherever it is not held in check by\r\nenlightened intelligence. And on the other hand the profession has\r\njust been startled by a verdict against a physician, ruinous in its\r\namount,--enough to drive many a hard-working young practitioner out\r\nof house and home,--a verdict which leads to the fear that suits for\r\nmalpractice may take the place of the panel game and child-stealing as a\r\nmeans of extorting money. If the profession in this State, which claims\r\na high standard of civilization, is to be crushed and ground beneath the\r\nupper millstone of the dearth of educational advantages and the lower\r\nmillstone of ruinous penalties for what the ignorant ignorantly shall\r\ndecide to be ignorance, all I can say is\r\n\r\n\r\n     God save the Commonhealth of Massachusetts!\r\n\r\nOnce more, we cannot fail to see that just as astrology has given place\r\nto astronomy, so theology, the science of Him whom by searching no man\r\ncan find out, is fast being replaced by what we may not improperly call\r\ntheonomy, or the science of the laws according to which the Creator\r\nacts. And since these laws find their fullest manifestations for us, at\r\nleast, in rational human natures, the study of anthropology is largely\r\nreplacing that of scholastic divinity. We must contemplate our Maker\r\nindirectly in human attributes as we talk of Him in human parts of\r\nspeech. And this gives a sacredness to the study of man in his physical,\r\nmental, moral, social, and religious nature which elevates the faithful\r\nstudents of anthropology to the dignity of a priesthood, and sheds a\r\nholy light on the recorded results of their labors, brought together as\r\nthey are in such a collection as this which is now spread out before us.\r\n\r\nThus, then, our library is a temple as truly as the dome-crowned\r\ncathedral hallowed by the breath of prayer and praise, where the dead\r\nrepose and the living worship. May it, with all its treasures, be\r\nconsecrated like that to the glory of God, through the contributions it\r\nshall make to the advancement of sound knowledge, to the relief of human\r\nsuffering, to the promotion of harmonious relations between the members\r\nof the two noble professions which deal with the diseases of the soul\r\nand with those of the body, and to the common cause in which all\r\ngood men are working, the furtherance of the well-being of their\r\nfellow-creatures!\r\n\r\nNOTE.--As an illustration of the statement in the last paragraph but\r\none, I take the following notice from the “Boston Daily Advertiser,” of\r\nDecember 4th, the day after the delivery of the address: “Prince Lucien\r\nBonaparte is now living in London, and is devoting himself to the work\r\nof collecting the creeds of all religions and sects, with a view\r\nto their classification,--his object being simply scientific or\r\nanthropological.”\r\n\r\nSince delivering the address, also, I find a leading article in the\r\n“Cincinnati Lancet and Clinic” of November 30th, headed “The\r\nDecadence of Homoeopathy,” abundantly illustrated by extracts from the\r\n“Homoeopathic Times,” the leading American organ of that sect.\r\n\r\nIn the New York “Medical Record” of the same date, which I had not seen\r\nbefore the delivery of my address, is an account of the action of the\r\nHomoeopathic Medical Society of Northern New York, in which Hahnemann's\r\ntheory of “dynamization” is characterized in a formal resolve as\r\n“unworthy the confidence of the Homoeopathic profession.”\r\n\r\nIt will be a disappointment to the German Homoeopathists to read in the\r\n“Homoeopathic Times” such a statement as the following: “Whatever the\r\ninfluences have been which have checked the outward development of\r\nHomoeopathy, it is plainly evident that the Homoeopathic school, as\r\nregards the number of its openly avowed representatives, has attained\r\nits majority, and has begun to decline both in this country and in\r\nEngland.”\r\n\r\nAll which is an additional reason for making a collection of the\r\nincredibly curious literature of Homoeopathy before that pseudological\r\ninanity has faded out like so many other delusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OF MY EARLY TEACHERS\r\n\r\n[A Farewell Address to the Medical School of Harvard University,\r\nNovember 28, 1882.]\r\n\r\nI had intended that the recitation of Friday last should be followed by\r\na few parting words to my class and any friends who might happen to be\r\nin the lecture-room. But I learned on the preceding evening that there\r\nwas an expectation, a desire, that my farewell should take a somewhat\r\ndifferent form; and not to disappoint the wishes of those whom I was\r\nanxious to gratify, I made up my mind to appear before you with such\r\nhasty preparation as the scanty time admitted.\r\n\r\nThere are three occasions upon which a human being has a right to\r\nconsider himself as a centre of interest to those about him: when he is\r\nchristened, when he is married, and when he is buried. Every one is the\r\nchief personage, the hero, of his own baptism, his own wedding, and his\r\nown funeral.\r\n\r\nThere are other occasions, less momentous, in which one may make more\r\nof himself than under ordinary circumstances he would think it proper\r\nto do; when he may talk about himself, and tell his own experiences,\r\nin fact, indulge in a more or less egotistic monologue without fear or\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\nI think I may claim that this is one of those occasions. I have\r\ndelivered my last anatomical lecture and heard my class recite for the\r\nlast time. They wish to hear from me again in a less scholastic mood\r\nthan that in which they have known me. Will you not indulge me in\r\ntelling you something of my own story?\r\n\r\nThis is the thirty-sixth Course of Lectures in which I have taken my\r\nplace and performed my duties as Professor of Anatomy. For more than\r\nhalf of my term of office I gave instruction in Physiology, after the\r\nfashion of my predecessors and in the manner then generally prevalent in\r\nour schools, where the physiological laboratory was not a necessary part\r\nof the apparatus of instruction. It was with my hearty approval that the\r\nteaching of Physiology was constituted a separate department and made\r\nan independent Professorship. Before my time, Dr. Warren had taught\r\nAnatomy, Physiology, and Surgery in the same course of Lectures, lasting\r\nonly three or four months. As the boundaries of science are enlarged,\r\nnew divisions and subdivisions of its territories become necessary. In\r\nthe place of six Professors in 1847, when I first became a member of\r\nthe Faculty, I count twelve upon the Catalogue before me, and I find the\r\nwhole number engaged in the work of instruction in the Medical School\r\namounts to no less than fifty.\r\n\r\nSince I began teaching in this school, the aspect of many branches of\r\nscience has undergone a very remarkable transformation. Chemistry and\r\nPhysiology are no longer what they were, as taught by the instructors\r\nof that time. We are looking forward to the synthesis of new organic\r\ncompounds; our artificial madder is already in the market, and the\r\nindigo-raisers are now fearing that their crop will be supplanted by the\r\nmanufactured article. In the living body we talk of fuel supplied and\r\nwork done, in movement, in heat, just as if we were dealing with a\r\nmachine of our own contrivance.\r\n\r\nA physiological laboratory of to-day is equipped with instruments of\r\nresearch of such ingenious contrivance, such elaborate construction,\r\nthat one might suppose himself in a workshop where some exquisite fabric\r\nwas to be wrought, such as Queens love to wear, and Kings do not always\r\nlove to pay for. They are, indeed, weaving a charmed web, for these are\r\nthe looms from which comes the knowledge that clothes the nakedness of\r\nthe intellect. Here are the mills that grind food for its hunger, and\r\n“is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?”\r\n\r\nBut while many of the sciences have so changed that the teachers of the\r\npast would hardly know them, it has not been so with the branch I teach,\r\nor, rather, with that division of it which is chiefly taught in this\r\namphitheatre. General anatomy, or histology, on the other hand, is\r\nalmost all new; it has grown up, mainly, since I began my medical\r\nstudies. I never saw a compound microscope during my years of study in\r\nParis. Individuals had begun to use the instrument, but I never heard\r\nit alluded to by either Professors or students. In descriptive anatomy I\r\nhave found little to unlearn, and not a great deal that was both new and\r\nimportant to learn. Trifling additions are made from year to year, not\r\nto be despised and not to be overvalued. Some of the older anatomical\r\nworks are still admirable, some of the newer ones very much the\r\ncontrary. I have had recent anatomical plates brought me for inspection,\r\nand I have actually button-holed the book-agent, a being commonly as\r\nhard to get rid of as the tar-baby in the negro legend, that I might put\r\nhim to shame with the imperial illustrations of the bones and muscles\r\nin the great folio of Albinus, published in 1747, and the unapproached\r\nfigures of the lymphatic system of Mascagni, now within a very few years\r\nof a century old, and still copied, or, rather, pretended to be copied,\r\nin the most recent works on anatomy.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that it is a good plan to get rid of old Professors, and I\r\nam thankful to hear that there is a movement for making provision\r\nfor those who are left in need when they lose their offices and their\r\nsalaries. I remember one of our ancient Cambridge Doctors once asked me\r\nto get into his rickety chaise, and said to me, half humorously, half\r\nsadly, that he was like an old horse,--they had taken off his saddle and\r\nturned him out to pasture. I fear the grass was pretty short where that\r\nold servant of the public found himself grazing. If I myself needed an\r\napology for holding my office so long, I should find it in the fact that\r\nhuman anatomy is much the same study that it was in the days of Vesalius\r\nand Fallopius, and that the greater part of my teaching was of such a\r\nnature that it could never become antiquated.\r\n\r\nLet me begin with my first experience as a medical student. I had come\r\nfrom the lessons of Judge Story and Mr. Ashmun in the Law School at\r\nCambridge. I had been busy, more or less, with the pages of Blackstone\r\nand Chitty, and other text-books of the first year of legal study. More\r\nor less, I say, but I am afraid it was less rather than more. For during\r\nthat year I first tasted the intoxicating pleasure of authorship. A\r\ncollege periodical, conducted by friends of mine, still undergraduates,\r\ntempted me into print, and there is no form of lead-poisoning which more\r\nrapidly and thoroughly pervades the blood and bones and marrow than that\r\nwhich reaches the young author through mental contact with type-metal.\r\nQui a bu, boira,--he who has once been a drinker will drink again, says\r\nthe French proverb. So the man or woman who has tasted type is sure to\r\nreturn to his old indulgence sooner or later. In that fatal year I had\r\nmy first attack of authors' lead-poisoning, and I have never got quite\r\nrid of it from that day to this. But for that I might have applied\r\nmyself more diligently to my legal studies, and carried a green bag in\r\nplace of a stethoscope and a thermometer up to the present day.\r\n\r\nWhat determined me to give up Law and apply myself to Medicine I can\r\nhardly say, but I had from the first looked upon that year's study as\r\nan experiment. At any rate, I made the change, and soon found myself\r\nintroduced to new scenes and new companionships.\r\n\r\nI can scarcely credit my memory when I recall the first impressions\r\nproduced upon me by sights afterwards become so familiar that they\r\ncould no more disturb a pulse-beat than the commonest of every-day\r\nexperiences. The skeleton, hung aloft like a gibbeted criminal, looked\r\ngrimly at me as I entered the room devoted to the students of the school\r\nI had joined, just as the fleshless figure of Time, with the hour-glass\r\nand scythe, used to glare upon me in my childhood from the “New England\r\nPrimer.” The white faces in the beds at the Hospital found their\r\nreflection in my own cheeks, which lost their color as I looked upon\r\nthem. All this had to pass away in a little time; I had chosen my\r\nprofession, and must meet its painful and repulsive aspects until they\r\nlost their power over my sensibilities.\r\n\r\nThe private medical school which I had joined was one established by Dr.\r\nJames Jackson, Dr. Walter Channing, Dr. John Ware, Dr. Winslow Lewis,\r\nand Dr. George W. Otis. Of the first three gentlemen I have either\r\nspoken elsewhere or may find occasion to speak hereafter. The two\r\nyounger members of this association of teachers were both graduates of\r\nour University, one of the year 1819, the other of 1818.\r\n\r\nDr. Lewis was a great favorite with students. He was a man of very\r\nlively temperament, fond of old books and young people, open-hearted,\r\nfree-spoken, an enthusiast in teaching, and especially at home in that\r\napartment of the temple of science where nature is seen in undress, the\r\nanthropotomic laboratory, known to common speech as the dissecting-room.\r\nHe had that quality which is the special gift of the man born for a\r\nteacher,--the power of exciting an interest in that which he taught.\r\nWhile he was present the apartment I speak of was the sunniest of\r\nstudios in spite of its mortuary spectacles. Of the students I met there\r\nI best remember James Jackson, Junior, full of zeal and playful as a\r\nboy, a young man whose early death was a calamity to the profession of\r\nwhich he promised to be a chief ornament; the late Reverend J. S. C.\r\nGreene, who, as the prefix to his name signifies, afterwards changed his\r\nprofession, but one of whose dissections I remember looking upon with\r\nadmiration; and my friend Mr. Charles Amory, as we call him, Dr. Charles\r\nAmory, as he is entitled to be called, then, as now and always, a\r\nfavorite with all about him. He had come to us from the schools\r\nof Germany, and brought with him recollections of the teachings of\r\nBlumenbach and the elder Langenbeck, father of him whose portrait hangs\r\nin our Museum. Dr. Lewis was our companion as well as our teacher. A\r\ngood demonstrator is,--I will not say as important as a good Professor\r\nin the teaching of Anatomy, because I am not sure that he is not\r\nmore important. He comes into direct personal relations with the\r\nstudents,--he is one of them, in fact, as the Professor cannot be from\r\nthe nature of his duties. The Professor's chair is an insulating stool,\r\nso to speak; his age, his knowledge, real or supposed, his official\r\nstation, are like the glass legs which support the electrician's piece\r\nof furniture, and cut it off from the common currents of the floor upon\r\nwhich it stands. Dr. Lewis enjoyed teaching and made his students enjoy\r\nbeing taught. He delighted in those anatomical conundrums to answer\r\nwhich keeps the student's eyes open and his wits awake. He was happy as\r\nhe dexterously performed the tour de maitre of the old barber-surgeons,\r\nor applied the spica bandage and taught his scholars to do it, so neatly\r\nand symmetrically that the aesthetic missionary from the older centre of\r\ncivilization would bend over it in blissful contemplation, as if it were\r\na sunflower. Dr. Lewis had many other tastes, and was a favorite, not\r\nonly with students, but in a wide circle, professional, antiquarian,\r\nmasonic, and social.\r\n\r\nDr. Otis was less widely known, but was a fluent and agreeable lecturer,\r\nand esteemed as a good surgeon.\r\n\r\nI must content myself with this glimpse at myself and a few of my\r\nfellow-students in Boston. After attending two courses of Lectures in\r\nthe school of the University, I went to Europe to continue my studies.\r\n\r\nYou may like to hear something of the famous Professors of Paris in the\r\ndays when I was a student in the Ecole de Medicine, and following the\r\ngreat Hospital teachers.\r\n\r\nI can hardly believe my own memory when I recall the old practitioners\r\nand Professors who were still going round the hospitals when I mingled\r\nwith the train of students that attended the morning visits. See that\r\nbent old man who is groping his way through the wards of La Charity.\r\nThat is the famous Baron Boyer, author of the great work on surgery in\r\nnine volumes, a writer whose clearness of style commends his treatise to\r\ngeneral admiration, and makes it a kind of classic. He slashes away at a\r\nterrible rate, they say, when he gets hold of the subject of fistula in\r\nits most frequent habitat,--but I never saw him do more than look as if\r\nhe wanted to cut a good dollop out of a patient he was examining. The\r\nshort, square, substantial man with iron-gray hair, ruddy face, and\r\nwhite apron is Baron Larrey, Napoleon's favorite surgeon, the most\r\nhonest man he ever saw,--it is reputed that he called him. To go round\r\nthe Hotel des Invalides with Larrey was to live over the campaigns\r\nof Napoleon, to look on the sun of Austerlitz, to hear the cannons of\r\nMarengo, to struggle through the icy waters of the Beresina, to shiver\r\nin the snows of the Russian retreat, and to gaze through the battle\r\nsmoke upon the last charge of the red lancers on the redder field of\r\nWaterloo. Larrey was still strong and sturdy as I saw him, and few\r\nportraits remain printed in livelier colors on the tablet of my memory.\r\n\r\nLeave the little group of students which gathers about Larrey beneath\r\nthe gilded dome of the Invalides and follow me to the Hotel Dieu, where\r\nrules and reigns the master-surgeon of his day, at least so far as\r\nParis and France are concerned,--the illustrious Baron Dupuytren. No\r\nman disputed his reign, some envied his supremacy. Lisfranc shrugged his\r\nshoulders as he spoke of “ce grand homme de l'autre cote de la riviere,”\r\n that great man on the other side of the river, but the great man he\r\nremained, until he bowed before the mandate which none may disobey.\r\n“Three times,” said Bouillaud, “did the apoplectic thunderbolt fall on\r\nthat robust brain,”--it yielded at last as the old bald cliff that\r\nis riven and crashes down into the valley. I saw him before the\r\nfirst thunderbolt had descended: a square, solid man, with a high and\r\nfull-domed head, oracular in his utterances, indifferent to those around\r\nhim, sometimes, it was said, very rough with them. He spoke in low, even\r\ntones, with quiet fluency, and was listened to with that hush of rapt\r\nattention which I have hardly seen in any circle of listeners unless\r\nwhen such men as ex-President John Quincy Adams or Daniel Webster were\r\nthe speakers. I do not think that Dupuytren has left a record which\r\nexplains his influence, but in point of fact he dominated those around\r\nhim in a remarkable manner. You must have all witnessed something of the\r\nsame kind. The personal presence of some men carries command with it,\r\nand their accents silence the crowd around them, when the same words\r\nfrom other lips might fall comparatively unheeded.\r\n\r\nAs for Lisfranc, I can say little more of him than that he was a\r\ngreat drawer of blood and hewer of members. I remember his ordering a\r\nwholesale bleeding of his patients, right and left, whatever might be\r\nthe matter with them, one morning when a phlebotomizing fit was on\r\nhim. I recollect his regretting the splendid guardsmen of the old\r\nEmpire,--for what? because they had such magnificent thighs to amputate.\r\nI got along about as far as that with him, when I ceased to be a\r\nfollower of M. Lisfranc.\r\n\r\nThe name of Velpeau must have reached many of you, for he died in 1867,\r\nand his many works made his name widely known. Coming to Paris in wooden\r\nshoes, starving, almost, at first, he raised himself to great eminence\r\nas a surgeon and as an author, and at last obtained the Professorship\r\nto which his talents and learning entitled him. His example may be an\r\nencouragement to some of my younger hearers who are born, not with the\r\nsilver spoon in their mouths, but with the two-tined iron fork in their\r\nhands. It is a poor thing to take up their milk porridge with in\r\ntheir young days, but in after years it will often transfix the solid\r\ndumplings that roll out of the silver spoon. So Velpeau found it. He\r\nhad not what is called genius, he was far from prepossessing in aspect,\r\nlooking as if he might have wielded the sledge-hammer (as I think he\r\nhad done in early life) rather than the lancet, but he had industry,\r\ndetermination, intelligence, character, and he made his way to\r\ndistinction and prosperity, as some of you sitting on these benches and\r\nwondering anxiously what is to become of you in the struggle for life\r\nwill have done before the twentieth century has got halfway through its\r\nfirst quarter. A good sound head over a pair of wooden shoes is a great\r\ndeal better than a wooden head belonging to an owner who cases his feet\r\nin calf-skin, but a good brain is not enough without a stout heart to\r\nfill the four great conduits which carry at once fuel and fire to that\r\nmightiest of engines.\r\n\r\nHow many of you who are before me are familiarly acquainted with the\r\nname of Broussais, or even with that of Andral? Both were lecturing at\r\nthe Ecole de Medicine, and I often heard them. Broussais was in those\r\ndays like an old volcano, which has pretty nearly used up its fire and\r\nbrimstone, but is still boiling and bubbling in its interior, and now\r\nand then sends up a spirt of lava and a volley of pebbles. His theories\r\nof gastro-enteritis, of irritation and inflammation as the cause of\r\ndisease, and the practice which sprang from them, ran over the fields of\r\nmedicine for a time like flame over the grass of the prairies. The way\r\nin which that knotty-featured, savage old man would bring out the word\r\nirritation--with rattling and rolling reduplication of the resonant\r\nletter r--might have taught a lesson in articulation to Salvini. But\r\nBroussais's theory was languishing and well-nigh become obsolete, and\r\nthis, no doubt, added vehemence to his defence of his cherished dogmas.\r\n\r\nOld theories, and old men who cling to them, must take themselves out of\r\nthe way as the new generation with its fresh thoughts and altered habits\r\nof mind comes forward to take the place of that which is dying out. This\r\nwas a truth which the fiery old theorist found it very hard to learn,\r\nand harder to bear, as it was forced upon him. For the hour of his\r\nlecture was succeeded by that of a younger and far more popular\r\nprofessor. As his lecture drew towards its close, the benches, thinly\r\nsprinkled with students, began to fill up; the doors creaked open and\r\nbanged back oftener and oftener, until at last the sound grew almost\r\ncontinuous, and the voice of the lecturer became a leonine growl as he\r\nstrove in vain to be heard over the noise of doors and footsteps.\r\n\r\nBroussais was now sixty-two years old. The new generation had outgrown\r\nhis doctrines, and the Professor for whose hour the benches had filled\r\nthemselves belonged to that new generation. Gabriel Andral was little\r\nmore than half the age of Broussais, in the full prime and vigor of\r\nmanhood at thirty-seven years. He was a rapid, fluent, fervid, and\r\nimaginative speaker, pleasing in aspect and manner,--a strong contrast\r\nto the harsh, vituperative old man who had just preceded him. His\r\nClinique Medicale is still valuable as a collection of cases, and\r\nhis researches on the blood, conducted in association with Gavarret,\r\ncontributed new and valuable facts to science. But I remember him\r\nchiefly as one of those instructors whose natural eloquence made it\r\ndelightful to listen to him. I doubt if I or my fellow-students did full\r\njustice either to him or to the famous physician of Hotel Dieu, Chomel.\r\nWe had addicted ourselves almost too closely to the words of another\r\nmaster, by whom we were ready to swear as against all teachers that ever\r\nwere or ever would be.\r\n\r\nThis object of our reverence, I might almost say idolatry, was one whose\r\nname is well known to most of the young men before me, even to those who\r\nmay know comparatively little of his works and teachings. Pierre Charles\r\nAlexandre Louis, at the age of forty-seven, as I recall him, was a tall,\r\nrather spare, dignified personage, of serene and grave aspect, but with\r\na pleasant smile and kindly voice for the student with whom he came\r\ninto personal relations. If I summed up the lessons of Louis in two\r\nexpressions, they would be these; I do not hold him answerable for the\r\nwords, but I will condense them after my own fashion in French, and then\r\ngive them to you, expanded somewhat, in English:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Formez toujours des idees nettes.\r\n     Fuyez toujours les a peu pres.\r\n\r\nAlways make sure that you form a distinct and clear idea of the matter\r\nyou are considering.\r\n\r\nAlways avoid vague approximations where exact estimates are possible;\r\nabout so many,--about so much, instead of the precise number and\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nNow, if there is anything on which the biological sciences have prided\r\nthemselves in these latter years it is the substitution of quantitative\r\nfor qualitative formulae. The “numerical system,” of which Louis was\r\nthe great advocate, if not the absolute originator, was an attempt\r\nto substitute series of carefully recorded facts, rigidly counted and\r\nclosely compared, for those never-ending records of vague, unverifiable\r\nconclusions with which the classics of the healing art were overloaded.\r\nThe history of practical medicine had been like the story of the\r\nDanaides. “Experience” had been, from time immemorial, pouring its\r\nflowing treasures into buckets full of holes. At the existing rate of\r\nsupply and leakage they would never be filled; nothing would ever be\r\nsettled in medicine. But cases thoroughly recorded and mathematically\r\nanalyzed would always be available for future use, and when accumulated\r\nin sufficient number would lead to results which would be trustworthy,\r\nand belong to science.\r\n\r\nYou young men who are following the hospitals hardly know how much you\r\nare indebted to Louis. I say nothing of his Researches on Phthisis or\r\nhis great work on Typhoid Fever. But I consider his modest and brief\r\nEssay on Bleeding in some Inflammatory Diseases, based on cases\r\ncarefully observed and numerically analyzed, one of the most important\r\nwritten contributions to practical medicine, to the treatment of\r\ninternal disease, of this century, if not since the days of Sydenham.\r\nThe lancet was the magician's wand of the dark ages of medicine. The old\r\nphysicians not only believed in its general efficacy as a wonder-worker\r\nin disease, but they believed that each malady could be successfully\r\nattacked from some special part of the body,--the strategic point which\r\ncommanded the seat of the morbid affection. On a figure given in the\r\ncurious old work of John de Ketam, no less than thirty-eight separate\r\nplaces are marked as the proper ones to bleed from, in different\r\ndiseases. Even Louis, who had not wholly given up venesection, used now\r\nand then to order that a patient suffering from headache should be bled\r\nin the foot, in preference to any other part.\r\n\r\nBut what Louis did was this: he showed by a strict analysis of numerous\r\ncases that bleeding did not strangle,--jugulate was the word then\r\nused,--acute diseases, more especially pneumonia. This was not a\r\nreform,--it was a revolution. It was followed up in this country by the\r\nremarkable Discourse of Dr. Jacob Bigelow upon Self-Limited Diseases,\r\nwhich has, I believe, done more than any other work or essay in our\r\nown language to rescue the practice of medicine from the slavery to the\r\ndrugging system which was a part of the inheritance of the profession.\r\n\r\nYes, I say, as I look back on the long hours of the many days I spent\r\nin the wards and in the autopsy room of La Pitie, where Louis was one\r\nof the attending physicians,--yes, Louis did a great work for practical\r\nmedicine. Modest in the presence of nature, fearless in the face of\r\nauthority, unwearying in the pursuit of truth, he was a man whom any\r\nstudent might be happy and proud to claim as his teacher and his friend,\r\nand yet, as I look back on the days when I followed his teachings, I\r\nfeel that I gave myself up too exclusively to his methods of thought and\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThere is one part of their business which certain medical practitioners\r\nare too apt to forget; namely, that what they should most of all try to\r\ndo is to ward off disease, to alleviate suffering, to preserve life, or\r\nat least to prolong it if possible. It is not of the slightest interest\r\nto the patient to know whether three or three and a quarter cubic inches\r\nof his lung are hepatized. His mind is not occupied with thinking of\r\nthe curious problems which are to be solved by his own autopsy,--whether\r\nthis or that strand of the spinal marrow is the seat of this or that\r\nform of degeneration. He wants something to relieve his pain, to\r\nmitigate the anguish of dyspnea, to bring back motion and sensibility\r\nto the dead limb, to still the tortures of neuralgia. What is it to him\r\nthat you can localize and name by some uncouth term the disease which\r\nyou could not prevent and which you cannot cure? An old woman who knows\r\nhow to make a poultice and how to put it on, and does it tuto, eito,\r\njucunde, just when and where it is wanted, is better,--a thousand times\r\nbetter in many cases,--than a staring pathologist, who explores and\r\nthumps and doubts and guesses, and tells his patient he will be better\r\ntomorrow, and so goes home to tumble his books over and make out a\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\nBut in those days, I, like most of my fellow students, was thinking much\r\nmore of “science” than of practical medicine, and I believe if we had\r\nnot clung so closely to the skirts of Louis and had followed some of\r\nthe courses of men like Trousseau,--therapeutists, who gave special\r\nattention to curative methods, and not chiefly to diagnosis,--it would\r\nhave been better for me and others. One thing, at any rate, we did\r\nlearn in the wards of Louis. We learned that a very large proportion of\r\ndiseases get well of themselves, without any special medication,--the\r\ngreat fact formulated, enforced, and popularized by Dr. Jacob Bigelow\r\nin the Discourse referred to. We unlearned the habit of drugging for its\r\nown sake. This detestable practice, which I was almost proscribed for\r\ncondemning somewhat too epigrammatically a little more than twenty years\r\nago, came to us, I suspect, in a considerable measure from the English\r\n“general practitioners,” a sort of prescribing apothecaries. You\r\nremember how, when the city was besieged, each artisan who was called\r\nupon in council to suggest the best means of defence recommended the\r\narticles he dealt in: the carpenter, wood; the blacksmith, iron; the\r\nmason, brick; until it came to be a puzzle to know which to adopt. Then\r\nthe shoemaker said, “Hang your walls with new boots,” and gave good\r\nreasons why these should be the best of all possible defences. Now the\r\n“general practitioner” charged, as I understand, for his medicine,\r\nand in that way got paid for his visit. Wherever this is the practice,\r\nmedicine is sure to become a trade, and the people learn to expect\r\ndrugging, and to consider it necessary, because drugs are so universally\r\ngiven to the patients of the man who gets his living by them.\r\n\r\nIt was something to have unlearned the pernicious habit of constantly\r\ngiving poisons to a patient, as if they were good in themselves, of\r\ndrawing off the blood which he would want in his struggle with disease,\r\nof making him sore and wretched with needless blisters, of turning his\r\nstomach with unnecessary nauseous draught and mixtures,--only because he\r\nwas sick and something must be done. But there were positive as well as\r\nnegative facts to be learned, and some of us, I fear, came home rich\r\nin the negatives of the expectant practice, poor in the resources which\r\nmany a plain country practitioner had ready in abundance for the relief\r\nand the cure of disease. No one instructor can be expected to do all for\r\na student which he requires. Louis taught us who followed him the love\r\nof truth, the habit of passionless listening to the teachings of nature,\r\nthe most careful and searching methods of observation, and the sure\r\nmeans of getting at the results to be obtained from them in the constant\r\nemployment of accurate tabulation. He was not a showy, or eloquent, or,\r\nI should say, a very generally popular man, though the favorite, almost\r\nthe idol, of many students, especially Genevese and Bostonians. But he\r\nwas a man of lofty and admirable scientific character, and his work will\r\nendure in its influences long after his name is lost sight of save to\r\nthe faded eyes of the student of medical literature.\r\n\r\nMany other names of men more or less famous in their day, and who were\r\nteaching while I was in Paris, come up before me. They are but empty\r\nsounds for the most part in the ears of persons of not more than middle\r\nage. Who of you knows anything of Richerand, author of a very popular\r\nwork on Physiology, commonly put into the student's hands when I first\r\nbegan to ask for medical text-books? I heard him lecture once, and have\r\nhad his image with me ever since as that of an old, worn-out man,--a\r\nvenerable but dilapidated relic of an effete antiquity. To verify this\r\nimpression I have just looked out the dates of his birth and death,\r\nand find that he was eighteen years younger than the speaker who is now\r\naddressing you. There is a terrible parallax between the period before\r\nthirty and that after threescore and ten, as two men of those ages look,\r\none with naked eyes, one through his spectacles, at the man of fifty and\r\nthereabout. Magendie, I doubt not you have all heard of. I attended but\r\none of his lectures. I question if one here, unless some contemporary\r\nof my own has strayed into the amphitheatre,--knows anything about\r\nMarjolin. I remember two things about his lectures on surgery, the deep\r\ntones of his voice as he referred to his oracle,--the earlier writer,\r\nJean Louis Petit,--and his formidable snuffbox. What he taught me lies\r\nfar down, I doubt not, among the roots of my knowledge, but it does\r\nnot flower out in any noticeable blossoms, or offer me any very obvious\r\nfruits. Where now is the fame of Bouillaud, Professor and Deputy, the\r\nSangrado of his time? Where is the renown of Piorry, percussionist and\r\npoet, expert alike in the resonances of the thoracic cavity and those\r\nof the rhyming vocabulary?--I think life has not yet done with the\r\nvivacious Ricord, whom I remember calling the Voltaire of pelvic\r\nliterature,--a sceptic as to the morality of the race in general, who\r\nwould have submitted Diana to treatment with his mineral specifics, and\r\nordered a course of blue pills for the vestal virgins.\r\n\r\nRicord was born at the beginning of the century, and Piorry some years\r\nearlier. Cruveilhier, who died in 1874, is still remembered by his great\r\nwork on pathological anatomy; his work on descriptive anatomy has some\r\nthings which I look in vain for elsewhere. But where is Civiale,--where\r\nare Orfila, Gendrin, Rostan, Biett, Alibert,--jolly old Baron Alibert,\r\nwhom I remember so well in his broad-brimmed hat, worn a little jauntily\r\non one side, calling out to the students in the court-yard of the\r\nHospital St. Louis, “Enfans de la methode naturelle, etes-vous tous\r\nici?” “Children of the natural method [his own method of classification\r\nof skin diseases,] are you all here?” All here, then, perhaps; all\r\nwhere, now?\r\n\r\nMy show of ghosts is over. It is always the same story that old men tell\r\nto younger ones, some few of whom will in their turn repeat the tale,\r\nonly with altered names, to their children's children.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Like phantoms painted on the magic slide,\r\n   Forth from the darkness of the past we glide,\r\n   As living shadows for a moment seen\r\n   In airy pageant on the eternal screen,\r\n   Traced by a ray from one unchanging flame,\r\n   Then seek the dust and stillness whence we came.\r\n\r\nDr. Benjamin Waterhouse, whom I well remember, came back from Leyden,\r\nwhere he had written his Latin graduating thesis, talking of the learned\r\nGaubius and the late illustrious Boerhaave and other dead Dutchmen, of\r\nwhom you know as much, most of you, as you do of Noah's apothecary and\r\nthe family physician of Methuselah, whose prescriptions seem to have\r\nbeen lost to posterity. Dr. Lloyd came back to Boston full of the\r\nteachings of Cheselden and Sharpe, William Hunter, Smellie, and Warner;\r\nDr. James Jackson loved to tell of Mr. Cline and to talk of Mr. John\r\nHunter; Dr. Reynolds would give you his recollections of Sir Astley\r\nCooper and Mr. Abernethy; I have named the famous Frenchmen of my\r\nstudent days; Leyden, Edinburgh, London, Paris, were each in turn the\r\nMecca of medical students, just as at the present day Vienna and Berlin\r\nare the centres where our young men crowd for instruction. These also\r\nmust sooner or later yield their precedence and pass the torch they\r\nhold to other hands. Where shall it next flame at the head of the long\r\nprocession? Shall it find its old place on the shores of the Gulf of\r\nSalerno, or shall it mingle its rays with the northern aurora up among\r\nthe fiords of Norway,--or shall it be borne across the Atlantic and\r\nreach the banks of the Charles, where Agassiz and Wyman have taught,\r\nwhere Hagen still teaches, glowing like his own Lampyris splendidula,\r\nwith enthusiasm, where the first of American botanists and the ablest\r\nof American surgeons are still counted in the roll of honor of our great\r\nUniversity?\r\n\r\nLet me add a few words which shall not be other than cheerful, as I bid\r\nfarewell to this edifice which I have known so long. I am grateful to\r\nthe roof which has sheltered me, to the floors which have sustained me,\r\nthough I have thought it safest always to abstain from anything like\r\neloquence, lest a burst of too emphatic applause might land my class\r\nand myself in the cellar of the collapsing structure, and bury us in the\r\nfate of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. I have helped to wear these stairs\r\ninto hollows,--stairs which I trod when they were smooth and level,\r\nfresh from the plane. There are just thirty-two of them, as there were\r\nfive and thirty years ago, but they are steeper and harder to climb, it\r\nseems to me, than they were then. I remember that in the early youth of\r\nthis building, the late Dr. John K. Mitchell, father of our famous Dr.\r\nWeir Mitchell, said to me as we came out of the Demonstrator's room,\r\nthat some day or other a whole class would go heels over head down this\r\ngraded precipice, like the herd told of in Scripture story. This has\r\nnever happened as yet; I trust it never will. I have never been proud\r\nof the apartment beneath the seats, in which my preparations for lecture\r\nwere made. But I chose it because I could have it to myself, and I\r\nresign it, with a wish that it were more worthy of regret, into the\r\nhands of my successor, with my parting benediction. Within its twilight\r\nprecincts I have often prayed for light, like Ajax, for the daylight\r\nfound scanty entrance, and the gaslight never illuminated its dark\r\nrecesses. May it prove to him who comes after me like the cave of the\r\nSibyl, out of the gloomy depths of which came the oracles which shone\r\nwith the rays of truth and wisdom!\r\n\r\nThis temple of learning is not surrounded by the mansions of the\r\ngreat and the wealthy. No stately avenues lead up to its facades\r\nand porticoes. I have sometimes felt, when convoying a distinguished\r\nstranger through its precincts to its door, that he might question\r\nwhether star-eyed Science had not missed her way when she found herself\r\nin this not too attractive locality. I cannot regret that we--you, I\r\nshould say--are soon to migrate to a more favored region, and carry on\r\nyour work as teachers and as learners in ampler halls and under far more\r\nfavorable conditions.\r\n\r\nI hope that I may have the privilege of meeting you there, possibly may\r\nbe allowed to add my words of welcome to those of my former colleagues,\r\nand in that pleasing anticipation I bid good-by to this scene of my long\r\nlabors, and, for the present at least, to the friends with whom I have\r\nbeen associated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDUM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO THE ADDRESS ON CURRENTS AND COUNTER CURRENTS IN MEDICAL\r\nSCIENCE.\r\n\r\nSome passages contained in the original manuscript of the Address, and\r\nomitted in the delivery on account of its length, are restored in the\r\ntext or incorporated with these Notes.\r\n\r\nNOTE A.--\r\n\r\nThere is good reason to doubt whether the nitrate of silver has any real\r\nefficacy in epilepsy. It has seemed to cure many cases, but epilepsy\r\nis a very uncertain disease, and there is hardly anything which has\r\nnot been supposed to cure it. Dr. Copland cites many authorities in its\r\nfavor, most especially Lombard's cases. But De la Berge and Monneret\r\n(Comp. de Med. Paris), 1839, analyze these same cases, eleven in number,\r\nand can only draw the inference of a very questionable value in the\r\nsupposed remedy. Dr. James Jackson says that relief of epilepsy is not\r\nto be attained by any medicine with which he is acquainted, but by diet.\r\n(Letters to a Young Physician, p. 67.) Guy Patin, Dean of the Faculty\r\nof Paris, Professor at the Royal College, Author of the Antimonial\r\nMartyrology, a wit and a man of sense and learning, who died almost two\r\nhundred years ago, had come to the same conclusion, though the chemists\r\nof his time boasted of their remedies. “Did, you ever see a case of\r\nepilepsy cured by nitrate of silver?” I said to one of the oldest and\r\nmost experienced surgeons in this country. “Never,” was his instant\r\nreply. Dr. Twitchell's experience was very similar. How, then, did\r\nnitrate of silver come to be given for epilepsy? Because, as Dr. Martin\r\nhas so well reminded us, lunatics were considered formerly to be under\r\nthe special influence of Luna, the moon (which Esquirol, be it observed,\r\nutterly denies), and lunar caustic, or nitrate of silver, is a salt of\r\nthat metal which was called luna from its whiteness, and of course\r\nmust be in the closest relations with the moon. It follows beyond all\r\nreasonable question that the moon's metal, silver, and its preparations,\r\nmust be the specific remedy for moonblasted maniacs and epileptics!\r\n\r\nYet the practitioner who prescribes the nitrate of silver supposes he\r\nis guided by the solemn experience of the past, instead of by its idle\r\nfancies. He laughs at those old physicians who placed such confidence\r\nin the right hind hoof of an elk as a remedy for the same disease, and\r\nleaves the record of his own belief in a treatment quite as fanciful and\r\nfar more objectionable, written in indelible ink upon a living tablet\r\nwhere he who runs may read it for a whole generation, if nature spares\r\nhis walking advertisement so long.\r\n\r\nNOTE B.--\r\n\r\nThe presumption that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty, does\r\nnot mean that there are no rogues, but lays the onus probandi on the\r\nparty to which it properly belongs. So with this proposition. A noxious\r\nagent should never be employed in sickness unless there is ample\r\nevidence in the particular case to overcome the general presumption\r\nagainst all such agents, and the evidence is very apt to be defective.\r\n\r\nThe miserable delusion of Homoeopathy builds itself upon an axiom\r\ndirectly the opposite of this; namely, that the sick are to be cured by\r\npoisons. Similia similibus curantur means exactly this. It is simply\r\na theory of universal poisoning, nullified in practice by the\r\ninfinitesimal contrivance. The only way to kill it and all similar\r\nfancies, and to throw every quack nostrum into discredit, is to root out\r\ncompletely the suckers of the old rotten superstition that whatever is\r\nodious or noxious is likely to be good for disease. The current of sound\r\npractice with ourselves is, I believe, setting fast in the direction\r\nI have indicated in the above proposition. To uphold the exhibition\r\nof noxious agents in disease, as the rule, instead of admitting them\r\ncautiously and reluctantly as the exception, is, as I think, an eddy of\r\nopinion in the direction of the barbarism out of which we believe our\r\nart is escaping. It is only through the enlightened sentiment and\r\naction of the Medical Profession that the community can be brought to\r\nacknowledge that drugs should always be regarded as evils.\r\n\r\nIt is true that some suppose, and our scientific and thoughtful\r\nassociate, Dr. Gould, has half countenanced the opinion, that there may\r\nyet be discovered a specific for every disease. Let us not despair of\r\nthe future, but let us be moderate in our expectations. When an oil is\r\ndiscovered that will make a bad watch keep good time; when a recipe is\r\ngiven which will turn an acephalous foetus into a promising child; when\r\na man can enter the second time into his mother's womb and give her back\r\nthe infirmities which twenty generations have stirred into her blood,\r\nand infused into his own through hers, we may be prepared to enlarge the\r\nNational Pharmacopoeia with a list of specifies for everything but old\r\nage,--and possibly for that also.\r\n\r\nNOTE C.--\r\n\r\nThe term specific is used here in its ordinary sense, without raising\r\nthe question of the propriety of its application to these or other\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nThe credit of introducing Cinchona rests between the Jesuits, the\r\nCountess of Chinchon, the Cardinal de Lugo, and Sir Robert Talbor,\r\nwho employed it as a secret remedy. (Pereira.) Mercury as an internal\r\nspecific remedy was brought into use by that impudent and presumptuous\r\nquack, as he was considered, Paracelsus. (Encyc. Brit. art.\r\n“Paracelsus.”) Arsenic was introduced into England as a remedy for\r\nintermittents by Dr. Fowler, in consequence of the success of a patent\r\nmedicine, the Tasteless Ague Drops, which were supposed, “probably\r\nwith reason,” to be a preparation of that mineral. (Rees's Cyc. art.\r\n“Arsenic.”) Colchicum came into notice in a similar way, from the\r\nsuccess of the Eau Medicinale of M. Husson, a French military officer.\r\n(Pereira.) Iodine was discovered by a saltpetre manufacturer, but\r\napplied by a physician in place of the old remedy, burnt sponge, which\r\nseems to owe its efficacy to it. (Dunglison, New Remedies.) As for\r\nSulphur, “the common people have long used it as an ointment” for\r\nscabies. (Rees's Cyc. art. “Scabies.”) The modern cantiscorbutic regimen\r\nis credited to Captain Cook. “To his sagacity we are indebted for the\r\nfirst impulse to those regulations by which scorbutus is so successfully\r\nprevented in our navy.” (Lond. Cyc. Prac. Med. art. “Scorbutus.”) Iron\r\nand various salts which enter into the normal composition of the human\r\nbody do not belong to the materia medica by our definition, but to the\r\nmateria alimentaria.\r\n\r\nFor the first introduction of iron as a remedy, see Pereira, who gives a\r\nvery curious old story.\r\n\r\nThe statement in the text concerning a portion of the materia medica\r\nstands exactly as delivered, and is meant exactly as it stands. No\r\ndenunciation of drugs, as sparingly employed by a wise physician, was\r\nor is intended. If, however, as Dr. Gould stated in his “valuable\r\nand practical discourse” to which the Massachusetts Medical Society\r\n“listened with profit as well as interest,” “Drugs, in themselves\r\nconsidered, may always be regarded as evils,”--any one who chooses may\r\nquestion whether the evils from their abuse are, on the whole, greater\r\nor less than the undoubted benefits obtained from their proper use. The\r\nlarge exception of opium, wine, specifics, and anaesthetics, made in the\r\ntext, takes off enough from the useful side, as I fully believe, to turn\r\nthe balance; so that a vessel containing none of these, but loaded with\r\nantimony, strychnine, acetate of lead, aloes, aconite, lobelia, lapis\r\ninfernalis, stercus diaboli, tormentilla, and other approved, and, in\r\nskilful hands, really useful remedies, brings, on the whole, more harm\r\nthan good to the port it enters.\r\n\r\nIt is a very narrow and unjust view of the practice of medicine, to\r\nsuppose it to consist altogether in the use of powerful drugs, or of\r\ndrugs of any kind. Far from it. “The physician may do very much for the\r\nwelfare of the sick, more than others can do, although he does not,\r\neven in the major part of cases, undertake to control and overcome\r\nthe disease by art. It was with these views that I never reported any\r\npatient cured at our hospital. Those who recovered their health were\r\nreported as well; not implying that they were made so by the active\r\ntreatment they had received there. But it was to be understood that all\r\npatients received in that house were to be cured, that is, taken care\r\nof.” (Letters to a Young Physician, by James Jackson, M. D., Boston,\r\n1855.)\r\n\r\n“Hygienic rules, properly enforced, fresh air, change of air, travel,\r\nattention to diet, good and appropriate food judiciously regulated,\r\ntogether with the administration of our tonics, porter, ale, wine, iron,\r\netc., supply the diseased or impoverished system with what Mr. Gull, of\r\nSt. Bartholomew's Hospital, aptly calls the 'raw material of the blood;'\r\nand we believe that if any real improvement has taken place in medical\r\npractice, independently of those truly valuable contributions we have\r\nbefore described, it is in the substitution of tonics, stimulants, and\r\ngeneral management, for drastic cathartics, for bleeding, depressing\r\nagents, including mercury, tartar emetics, etc., so much in vogue during\r\nthe early part even of this century.” (F. P. Porcher, in Charleston Med.\r\nJournal and Review for January, 1860.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Medical Essays, by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.",
