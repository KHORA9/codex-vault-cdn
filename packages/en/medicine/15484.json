The room\r\nshould be warm; if possible there should be an open fire. The head and\r\nface should first be washed and dried; then the body should be soaped\r\nand the infant placed in the tub with its body well supported by the\r\nhand of the nurse. The bath should be given quickly, and the body\r\ndried rapidly with a soft towel, but with very little rubbing.\r\n\r\n_At what temperature should the bath be given?_\r\n\r\nFor the first few weeks at 100° F.; later, during early infancy, at\r\n98° F.; after six months, at 95° F.; during the second year, from 85°\r\nto 90° F.\r\n\r\n_With what should the bath be given?_\r\n\r\nSoft sponges are useful for bathing the body, limbs and scalp. There\r\nshould be a separate wash-cloth for the face and another for the\r\nbuttocks.\r\n\r\n_What are the objections to bath sponges?_\r\n\r\nWhen used frequently, they become very dirty and are liable to cause\r\ninfection of the eyes, mouth or genital organs.\r\n\r\n_Under what circumstances should the daily tub bath be omitted?_\r\n\r\nIn the case of very feeble or delicate infants on account of the\r\nexposure and fatigue, and in all forms of acute illness except by\r\ndirection of the physician. In eczema and many other forms of skin\r\ndisease much harm is often done by bathing with soap and water, or\r\neven with water alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENITAL ORGANS\r\n\r\n_How should the genital organs of a female child be cleansed?_\r\n\r\nBest with fresh absorbent cotton and tepid water, or a solution of\r\nboric acid, two teaspoonfuls to the pint. This should be done\r\ncarefully at least once a day. If any discharge is present, the\r\nboric-acid solution should invariably be used twice a day. Great care\r\nis necessary at all times to prevent infection which often arises from\r\nsoiled napkins.\r\n\r\n_How should the genital organs of a male child be cleansed?_\r\n\r\nIn infancy and early childhood the foreskin should be pushed back at\r\nleast twice a week while the child is in his bath, and the parts thus\r\nexposed washed gently with absorbent cotton and water.\r\n\r\nIf the foreskin is tightly adherent and cannot readily be pushed back,\r\nthe physician's attention should be called to it. The nurse or mother\r\nshould not attempt forcible stretching.\r\n\r\n_When is circumcision advisable?_\r\n\r\nUsually, when the foreskin is very long and so tight that it cannot be\r\npushed back without force; always, when this condition is accompanied\r\nby evidences of local irritation or difficulty in passing water.\r\n\r\n\r\nEYES\r\n\r\n_How should the eyes of a little baby be cleansed?_\r\n\r\nWith a piece of soft linen or absorbent cotton and a lukewarm solution\r\nof salt or boric acid,--one half of an even teaspoonful to one pint of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_If pus appears in the eyes, what should be done?_\r\n\r\nThey should be cleansed every hour with a solution of boric acid (ten\r\ngrains to one ounce of water). If the lids stick together, a little\r\nvaseline from a tube should be rubbed upon them at night. If the\r\ntrouble is slight, this treatment will control it; if it is severe, a\r\nphysician should be called immediately, as delay may result in loss of\r\neyesight.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUTH\r\n\r\n_How is an infant's mouth to be cleansed?_\r\n\r\nAn excellent method is by the use of a swab made by twisting a bit of\r\nabsorbent cotton upon a wooden toothpick. With this the folds between\r\nthe gums and lips and cheeks may be gently and carefully cleansed\r\ntwice a day unless the mouth is sore. It is not necessary after every\r\nfeeding. The finger of the nurse, often employed, is too large and\r\nliable to injure the delicate mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n_What is sprue?_\r\n\r\nIt appears on the lips and inside the cheeks like little white threads\r\nor flakes. It is also called thrush. In bad cases it may cover the\r\ntongue and the whole of the inside of the mouth.\r\n\r\n_How should a mouth be cleansed when there is sprue?_\r\n\r\nIt should be washed carefully after every feeding or nursing with a\r\nsolution of borax or bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), one even\r\nteaspoonful to three ounces of water, and four times a day the\r\nboric-acid solution mentioned should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKIN\r\n\r\n_How should the infant's skin be cared for to prevent chafing?_\r\n\r\nFirst, not too much nor too strong soap should be used; secondly,\r\ncareful rinsing of the body; thirdly, not too vigorous rubbing, either\r\nduring or after the bath; fourthly, the use of dusting powder in all\r\nthe folds of the skin,--under the arms, behind the ears, about the\r\nneck, in the groin, etc. This is of the utmost importance in very fat\r\ninfants.\r\n\r\n_If the skin is very sensitive and chafing easily produced, what\r\nshould be done?_\r\n\r\nNo soap should be used, but bran or salt baths given instead.\r\n\r\n_How should a bran bath be prepared?_\r\n\r\nOne pint of wheat bran should be placed in a bag of coarse muslin or\r\ncheese-cloth, and this put in the bath water. It should then be\r\nsqueezed for five minutes until the water resembles a thin porridge.\r\n\r\n_How should a salt bath be prepared?_\r\n\r\nA teacupful of common salt or sea salt should be used to each two\r\ngallons of water.\r\n\r\n_How should the buttocks be cared for?_\r\n\r\nThis is the most common place for chafing, as the parts are so\r\nfrequently wet and soiled; hence the utmost pains should be taken that\r\nall napkins be removed as soon as they are wet or soiled, and the\r\nparts kept scrupulously clean.\r\n\r\n_If the parts have become chafed, what should be done?_\r\n\r\nOnly bran and salt baths should be used, and in very severe cases even\r\nthese may have to be omitted for a day or two. The parts may be\r\ncleansed with sweet oil and a little absorbent cotton, and the skin\r\nkept covered with a dusting powder composed of starch two parts, boric\r\nacid one part.\r\n\r\n_What is prickly heat, and how is it produced?_\r\n\r\nIt consists of fine red pimples, and is caused by excessive\r\nperspiration and the irritation of flannel underclothing.\r\n\r\n_How should it be treated?_\r\n\r\nMuslin or linen should be put next to the skin; the entire body should\r\nbe sponged frequently with equal parts of vinegar and water, and\r\nplenty of the starch and boric-acid powder mentioned should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOTHING\r\n\r\n_What are the most essential things in the clothing of infants?_\r\n\r\nThat the chest shall be covered with soft flannel, the limbs well\r\nprotected but not confined, and the abdomen supported by a broad\r\nflannel band, which should be snug but not too tight. It is important\r\nthat the clothing should fit the body. If it is too tight it\r\ninterferes with the free movements of the chest in breathing, and by\r\npressing upon the stomach sometimes causes the infant to vomit soon\r\nafter swallowing its food. If the clothing is too loose it is soon\r\nthrown into deep folds or bunches, which cause much discomfort. No\r\npins should be used, but, instead all bands about the body should be\r\nbasted. The petticoats should be supported by shoulder straps.\r\n\r\n_How should the infant be held during dressing and undressing?_\r\n\r\nNothing is more awkward than to attempt to dress a young baby in a\r\nsitting posture. It should lie upon the nurse's lap until quite old\r\nenough to sit alone, the clothing being drawn over the child's feet,\r\nnot slipped over the head.\r\n\r\n_Of what use is the band?_\r\n\r\nIt protects the abdomen, but its most important use is to support the\r\nabdominal walls in very young infants, and in this way to prevent the\r\noccurrence of rupture.\r\n\r\n_How long is this band required?_\r\n\r\nThe snug flannel band, not usually more than four months. In healthy\r\ninfants this may then be replaced by the knitted band, which may be\r\nworn up to eighteen months. The band is an important article of dress\r\nin the case of thin infants whose abdominal organs are not\r\nsufficiently protected by fat. With such, or with those prone to\r\ndiarrhoea, it is often advisable to continue the band until the third\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n_What changes are to be made in the clothing of infants in the\r\nsummer?_\r\n\r\nOnly the thinnest gauze flannel undershirts should be worn, and\r\nchanges in temperature should be met by changes in the outer garments.\r\nThe greatest care should be taken that children are not kept too hot\r\nin the middle of the day, while extra wraps should be used morning and\r\nevening, especially at the seashore or in the mountains.\r\n\r\n_Should older children be allowed to go with their legs bare?_\r\n\r\nIf strong and well there is no objection to this in very hot weather.\r\nIn cold weather, however, it is doubtful if any children are benefited\r\nby it, particularly in a changeable climate like that of New York.\r\nMany delicate children are certainly injured by such attempts at\r\nhardening.\r\n\r\n_What sort of underclothing should be worn during cold weather?_\r\n\r\nNever the heaviest weight, even in winter. Four grades are usually\r\nsold, the next to the heaviest being thick enough for any child.\r\n\r\n_Do little children require as heavy flannels as older people?_\r\n\r\nNot as a rule. They usually live in a warm nursery; their circulation\r\nis active; and they always perspire easily during their play. When\r\nthey go out of doors, the addition of coats and leggings renders thick\r\nflannels unnecessary.\r\n\r\n_Are not many little children clothed too thinly for the ordinary\r\nhouse?_\r\n\r\nVery few. The almost invariable mistake made in city homes is that of\r\nexcessive clothing and too warm rooms. These two things are among the\r\nmost frequent reasons for their taking cold so easily.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPKINS\r\n\r\n_How should napkins be taken care of?_\r\n\r\nThey should he immediately removed from the nursery when soiled or\r\nwet. Soiled napkins should be kept in a receptacle with a tight cover,\r\nand washed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n_Should napkins which have been only wet be used a second time without\r\nwashing?_\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt better to use only fresh napkins, but there is no\r\nserious objection to using them twice unless there is chafing of the\r\nskin. Clean napkins, changed as soon as wet or soiled, are of much\r\nimportance in keeping the skin healthy.\r\n\r\n_What are the important things to be observed in washing napkins?_\r\n\r\nSoiled napkins should not be allowed to dry, but should receive a\r\nrough washing at once; they should then be kept in soak in plain water\r\nuntil a convenient time for washing,--at least once every day,--when\r\nthey should be washed in hot suds and boiled at least fifteen minutes.\r\nAfterward they should be very thoroughly rinsed or they may irritate\r\nthe skin, and ironed without starch or blueing. They should never be\r\nused when clamp.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSERY\r\n\r\n_What are the essentials in a good nursery?_\r\n\r\nThe furnishings should be very simple, and unnecessary hangings and\r\nupholstered furniture should be excluded. As large a room as possible\r\nshould be selected--one that is well ventilated, and always one in\r\nwhich the sun shines at some part of the day, as it should be\r\nremembered that an average child spends here at least three fourths of\r\nits time during the first year. The nursery should have dark shades at\r\nthe windows, but no extra hangings or curtains; about the baby's crib\r\nnothing but what can be washed should be allowed. The air should be\r\nkept as fresh and as pure as possible. There should be no plumbing no\r\ndrying of napkins or clothes, no cooking of food, and no gas burning\r\nat night. A small wax night-light answers every purpose.\r\n\r\n_How should a nursery be heated?_\r\n\r\nBest by an open fire; next to this by a Franklin stove. The ordinary\r\nhot-air furnace of cities has many objections, but it is not so bad as\r\nsteam heat from a radiator in the room. A gas stove is even worse than\r\nthis, and should never be used, except, perhaps, for a few minutes\r\nduring the morning bath.\r\n\r\n_At what temperature should a nursery be kept during the day?_\r\n\r\nBest, 66° to 68° F., measured by a thermometer hanging three feet from\r\nthe floor. Never should the temperature be allowed to go above 70° F.\r\n\r\n_At what temperature during the night?_\r\n\r\nDuring the first two or three months, not below 65° F. After three\r\nmonths the temperature may go as low as 55° F. After the first year it\r\nmay be 50° or even 45° F.\r\n\r\n_At what age may the window be left open at night?_\r\n\r\nUsually after the third month, except when the outside temperature is\r\nbelow freezing point.\r\n\r\n_How often should the nursery be aired?_\r\n\r\nAt least twice a day--in the morning after the child's bath, and again\r\nin the evening before the child is put to bed for the night. This\r\nshould be done thoroughly, and the child should be removed meanwhile\r\nto another apartment. It is well to air the nursery whenever the child\r\nis out of the room.\r\n\r\n_What symptoms are seen in a child who is kept in too hot a room?_\r\n\r\nIt becomes pale, loses appetite, shows symptoms of indigestion,\r\noccasionally vomits, stops gaining in weight, perspires very much, and\r\ntakes cold easily because of this and also because of the great\r\ndifference between the indoor and outdoor temperatures. Its condition\r\nmay be such as to lead one to suspect very serious illness.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIRING\r\n\r\n_How early may airing indoors he commenced and how long may it be\r\ncontinued?_\r\n\r\nAiring in the room may be begun, even in cold weather, when the child\r\nis one month old, at first for only fifteen minutes at a time. This\r\nperiod may be gradually lengthened by ten or fifteen minutes each day\r\nuntil it is four or five hours. This airing may be continued in almost\r\nall kinds of weather.\r\n\r\n_Is there not great danger of a young baby's taking cold when aired in\r\nthis manner?_\r\n\r\nNot if the period is at first short and the baby accustomed to it\r\ngradually. Instead of rendering the child liable to take cold, it is\r\nthe best means of preventing colds.\r\n\r\n_How should such an airing be given?_\r\n\r\nThe child should be dressed with bonnet and light coat as if for the\r\nstreet and placed in its crib or carriage which should stand a few\r\nfeet from the window All the windows are then thrown wide open, but\r\nthe doors closed to prevent draughts. Screens are unnecessary.\r\n\r\n_At what age may a child go out of doors?_\r\n\r\nIn summer, when one week old; in spring and fall, usually at about one\r\nmonth; in winter, when about three months old, on pleasant days, being\r\nkept in, the sun and out of the wind.\r\n\r\n_What are the best hours for airing out of doors?_\r\n\r\nIn summer and early autumn a child may be out almost any time between\r\nseven in the morning and sunset; in winter and early spring, a young\r\nchild only between 10 or 11 A.M. and 3 P.M., although this depends\r\nsomewhat upon the climate. In New York and along the Atlantic coast\r\nthe early mornings are apt to be damp and the afternoons raw and\r\ncloudy.\r\n\r\n_On what kind of days should a baby not go out?_\r\n\r\nIn sharp winds, when the ground is covered with melting snow, and when\r\nit is extremely cold. A child under four months old should not usually\r\ngo out if the thermometer is below freezing point; nor one under eight\r\nmonths old if it is below 20° F.\r\n\r\n_What are the most important things to be attended to when the child\r\nis out in its carriage?_\r\n\r\nTo see that the wind never blows in its face, that its feet are\r\nproperly covered and warm, and that the sun is never allowed to shine\r\ndirectly into its eyes when the child is either asleep or awake.\r\n\r\n_Of what advantage to the child is going out?_\r\n\r\nFresh air is required to renew and purify the blood, and this is just\r\nas necessary for health and growth as proper food.\r\n\r\n_What are the effects produced in infants by fresh air?_\r\n\r\nThe appetite is improved, the digestion is better, the cheeks become\r\nred, and all signs of health are seen.\r\n\r\n_Is there any advantage in having a child take its airing during the\r\nfirst five or six months in the nurse's arms?_\r\n\r\nNone whatever. A child can be made much more comfortable in a baby\r\ncarriage, and can be equally well protected against exposure by\r\nblankets and the carriage umbrella.\r\n\r\n_What are the objections to an infant's sleeping out of doors?_\r\n\r\nThere are no real objections. It is not true that infants take cold\r\nmore easily when asleep than awake, while it is almost invariably the\r\ncase that those who sleep out of doors are stronger children and less\r\nprone to take cold than others.\r\n\r\n_What can be done for children who take cold upon the slightest\r\nprovocation?_\r\n\r\nThey should be kept in cool rooms, especially when asleep They should\r\nnot wear such heavy clothing that they are in a perspiration much of\r\nthe time. Every morning the body, particularly the chest and back,\r\nshould be sponged with cold water (50° to 60° F.).\r\n\r\n_How should this cold sponge bath be given?_\r\n\r\nThe child should stand in a tub containing a little warm water, and a\r\nlarge bath sponge filled with cold water should be squeezed two or\r\nthree times over the body. This should be followed by a vigorous\r\nrubbing with a towel until the skin is quite red. This may be used at\r\nthree years, and often at two years. For infants a little higher\r\ntemperature (65° to 70°) may be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT, GROWTH, AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n_Of what importance is the weight of the child?_\r\n\r\nNothing else tells so accurately how well it is thriving.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year a record of the weight is almost indispensable;\r\nthroughout childhood it is of much interest and is the best guide to\r\nthe physical condition. It will well repay any mother or nurse to keep\r\nsuch a record.\r\n\r\n_How frequently should a child be weighed?_\r\n\r\nEvery week during the first six months, and at least once in two weeks\r\nduring the last six months of the first year. During the second year a\r\nchild should be weighed at least once a month.\r\n\r\n_How rapidly should an infant gain in weight during the first year?_\r\n\r\nThere is usually a loss during the first week of from four to eight\r\nounces; after this a healthy child should gain from four to eight\r\nounces a week up to about the sixth month. From six to twelve months\r\nthe gain is less, usually from two to four ounces a week.\r\n\r\n_Is it to be expected that bottle-fed infants will gain as rapidly as\r\nthose who are nursed?_\r\n\r\nThey seldom do so during the first month; after that time under\r\nfavourable circumstances the gain is usually quite as regular, and\r\nduring the latter half of the first year it is likely to be more\r\ncontinuous than in a nursing infant, because the latter usually loses\r\nweight at the time of weaning.\r\n\r\n_Why do they not gain so rapidly at first?_\r\n\r\nIt takes a few weeks for the stomach to become accustomed to cow's\r\nmilk, and until this is accomplished it is necessary to make the milk\r\nvery weak or the child's digestion will be upset.\r\n\r\n_For a child of average weight at birth (seven to seven and a half\r\npounds) what should be the weight at the different periods during the\r\nfirst year?_\r\n\r\nAt three months it should be twelve to thirteen pounds; at six months,\r\nfifteen to sixteen pounds; at nine months, seventeen to eighteen\r\npounds; at one year, twenty to twenty-two pounds. At five months a\r\nhealthy child will usually double its weight, and at twelve months it\r\nwill nearly treble its weight.\r\n\r\n_Do all healthy infants gain steadily in weight during the first\r\nyear?_\r\n\r\nAs a rule they do; yet it is seldom the case that one gains every week\r\nfor the entire year. With most infants there are from time to time\r\nperiods of a few weeks in which no gain is made. These are more often\r\nseen from the seventh to the tenth month and frequently occur when the\r\nchild is cutting teeth, sometimes during very hot weather.\r\n\r\n_Is it true that every infant who gains rapidly in weight is thriving\r\nnormally?_\r\n\r\nNot invariably. Some who are fed upon prepared infant foods increase\r\nrapidly in weight but not in strength, nor in their development in\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\n_Is the weight of as much value in the second year as a guide to the\r\nchild's condition?_\r\n\r\nAfter the first year, the gain in weight is seldom continuous; there\r\nare many interruptions, some depend on season, and others often occur\r\nwithout apparent cause.\r\n\r\n_At what age should the fontanel close?_\r\n\r\nThe average is about eighteen months. It seldom closes earlier than\r\nfourteen months, and it should not be open at two years.\r\n\r\n_At what age should a child hold up its head?_\r\n\r\nAs a rule during the fourth month, and often during the third month,\r\nthe head can be held erect when the body is supported.\r\n\r\n_When does an infant first laugh aloud?_\r\n\r\nUsually from the third to the fifth month.\r\n\r\n_When does it begin to reach for toys and handle them?_\r\n\r\nUsually from the fifth to the seventh month.\r\n\r\n_At what age should a child be able to sit and to stand alone?_\r\n\r\nAt seven or eight months a healthy child is usually able to sit erect\r\nand support the body. During the ninth and tenth months are usually\r\nseen the first attempts to bear the weight upon the feet, and at\r\neleven or twelve months most children can stand with assistance.\r\n\r\n_When should a child walk alone?_\r\n\r\nThe first attempts are generally seen in the twelfth or thirteenth\r\nmonth. At fifteen or sixteen months the average child is able to run\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n_What conditions postpone these events?_\r\n\r\nPrematurity, a very delicate constitution, any severe or prolonged\r\nillness, and especially chronic disturbances of digestion making\r\nfeeding difficult. A common cause of late sitting, standing, or\r\nwalking is rickets.\r\n\r\n_Should a child be urged to walk?_\r\n\r\nNever; he is usually quite willing to do so as soon as his muscles and\r\nbones are strong enough. None of the contrivances for teaching\r\nchildren to walk are to be advised.\r\n\r\n_When do children begin to talk?_\r\n\r\nGenerally at one year a child can say \"papa\" and \"mamma\" or other\r\nsingle words. At the end of the second year the average child is able\r\nto put words together in short sentences.\r\n\r\n_If at two years the child makes no attempt to speak, what should be\r\nsuspected?_\r\n\r\nEither that the child is a deaf-mute or that it is mentally deficient,\r\nalthough this is occasionally seen in children who are only very\r\nbackward.\r\n\r\n    _Table showing the Average Weight, Height, and\r\n     Circumference of Head and Chest of Boys_[1]\r\n\r\n    At birth        Weight             7-1/2  pounds.\r\n                    Height            20-1/2 inches.\r\n                    Chest             13-1/2   \"\r\n                    Head              14       \"\r\n\r\n    One year        Weight            21     pounds.\r\n                    Height            29     inches.\r\n                    Chest             18       \"\r\n                    Head              18       \"\r\n\r\n    Two years       Weight            26-1/2 pounds.\r\n                    Height            32-1/2 inches.\r\n                    Chest             19       \"\r\n                    Head              19       \"\r\n\r\n    Three years     Weight            31     pounds.\r\n                    Height            35     inches.\r\n                    Chest             20       \"\r\n                    Head              19-1/2   \"\r\n\r\n    Four years      Weight            35     pounds.\r\n                    Height            38     inches.\r\n                    Chest             20-3/4   \"\r\n                    Head              19-3/4   \"\r\n\r\n    Five years      Weight            41 pounds.\r\n                    Height            41-1/2 inches.\r\n                    Chest             21-1/2   \"\r\n                    Head              20-1/2   \"\r\n\r\n    Six years       Weight            45 pounds.\r\n                    Height            44 inches.\r\n                    Chest             23   \"\r\n\r\n    Seven years     Weight            49-1/2 pounds.\r\n                    Height            46 inches.\r\n                    Chest             23-1/2 \"\r\n\r\n    Eight years     Weight            54-1/2 pounds.\r\n                    Height            48 inches.\r\n                    Chest             24-1/2 \"\r\n\r\n    Nine years      Weight            60 pounds.\r\n                    Height            50 inches.\r\n                    Chest         .   25   \"\r\n\r\n    Ten years       Weight            66-1/2 pounds.\r\n                    Height            52 inches.\r\n                    Chest             26   \"\r\n\r\n    The above weights are with ordinary house clothes.\r\n\r\n    [1] Weights for the first four years are without clothes.\r\n\r\n    The weight of girls is on the average about one pound less than\r\n    boys.

The other two\r\nlower central teeth and the four front double teeth come from the\r\ntwelfth to the eighteenth month. Then follow the four canine teeth,\r\nthe two upper ones being known as the \"eye teeth,\" and the two lower\r\nas the \"stomach teeth\"; they generally come between the eighteenth and\r\nthe twenty-fourth month. The four back double teeth, which complete\r\nthe first set, come between the twenty-fourth and thirtieth month.\r\n\r\n  At one year a child usually has six teeth.\r\n  At one and a half years, twelve teeth.\r\n  At two years, sixteen teeth.\r\n  At two and a half years, twenty teeth.\r\n\r\n_What are the causes of variation?_\r\n\r\nThe time of appearance of the teeth varies in different families; in\r\nsome they come very early, in others much later. The teeth may come\r\nlate as a result of prolonged illness and also from rickets.\r\n\r\n_What symptoms are commonly seen with teething?_\r\n\r\nIn healthy children there is very often fretfulness and poor sleep for\r\ntwo or three nights; there may be loss of appetite, so that only one\r\nhalf the usual amount of food is taken; there is salivation or\r\ndrooling, and often slight fever; there may be some symptoms of\r\nindigestion, such as vomiting or the appearance of undigested food in\r\nthe stools. In delicate children all these symptoms may be much more\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\n_How long do these symptoms last?_\r\n\r\nUsually only three or four days; but there may be no gain in weight\r\nfor two or three weeks.\r\n\r\n_What is the cause of most of the other symptoms attributed to\r\nteething?_\r\n\r\nNearly all of them come from indigestion due to bad feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nINFANT FEEDING\r\n\r\n\r\n_What is the best infant food?_\r\n\r\nMother's milk.\r\n\r\n_Of what is mother's milk composed?_\r\n\r\nThirteen parts solids and eighty-seven parts water.\r\n\r\n_What are the solids?_\r\n\r\nFat, sugar, proteids, and salts.\r\n\r\n_What is the fat?_\r\n\r\nThe cream.\r\n\r\n_What is the sugar?_\r\n\r\nIt is lactose, or milk sugar.\r\n\r\n_What are the proteids?_\r\n\r\nThe curd of the milk.\r\n\r\n_Are all these elements necessary?_\r\n\r\nYes; we cannot expect to rear a healthy infant unless they are all in\r\nhis food.\r\n\r\n_Of what use is the fat?_\r\n\r\nIt is needed for the growth of the bones, the nerves, the fat of the\r\nbody, and the production of heat.\r\n\r\n_Of what use is the sugar?_\r\n\r\nIt is needed for the production of heat, and to make fat in the body.\r\n\r\n_Of what use are the proteids?_\r\n\r\nThey are needed for the growth of the cells of the body, such as those\r\nof the blood, the various organs, and the muscles.\r\n\r\n_Of what use are the salts?_\r\n\r\nParticularly for the growth of bone.\r\n\r\n_Of what use is the water?_\r\n\r\nBy means of the water the food is kept in a state of minute\r\nsubdivision or in solution, so that the delicate organs of a young\r\ninfant can digest it. It is also necessary to enable the body to get\r\nrid of its waste.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSING\r\n\r\n_Should all mothers attempt to nurse their children?_\r\n\r\nAs a rule they should do so, but there are many conditions when they\r\nshould not.\r\n\r\n_What are the most important ones?_\r\n\r\nIf the mother has or has had tuberculosis or any other serious chronic\r\ndisease, or is herself in very delicate health, she should not try.\r\nShe is likely soon to fail in nourishing her child, and the attempt\r\nmay do herself much harm as well as injure the child.\r\n\r\n_How often should infants be nursed during the first two days of\r\nlife?_\r\n\r\nUsually only four or five times daily, since there is very little milk\r\nsecreted at this time.\r\n\r\n_When does the milk come in abundance?_\r\n\r\nUsually on the third day, sometimes not until the fourth or fifth day.\r\n\r\n_Should the infant be fed anything additional during the first two\r\ndays?_\r\n\r\nUsually not; if much food were necessary, we may be sure Nature would\r\nhave provided it. Water, however, should be given regularly.\r\n\r\n_How frequently should an infant be nursed during the first week?_\r\n\r\nAfter the third day, every two hours during the day and twice during\r\nthe night. The frequency during the rest of the first year is given in\r\nthe following table:\r\n\r\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    PERIOD.             Nursings in    Interval    Night nursings\r\n                        24 hours.      by day.     (10 P.M. to 6 A.M.).\r\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    1st and 2d day          4          6 hours.             1\r\n    3 days to 6 weeks      10          2     \"              2\r\n    6 weeks to 3 months     8          2-1/2 \"              2\r\n    3 to 5 months           7          3     \"              1\r\n    5 to 12 months          6          3     \"              0\r\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n_How long should the child be kept at the breast for one nursing?_\r\n\r\nNot over twenty minutes.\r\n\r\n_Should the child take both breasts at one nursing?_\r\n\r\nIf the milk is very abundant one breast may be sufficient, otherwise\r\nboth breasts may be taken.\r\n\r\n_What are the important things to be attended to in nursing?_\r\n\r\nFirst, regularity; it is just as important as in the case of\r\nbottle-feeding. Secondly, the nipples should be kept clean by being\r\nwashed after every nursing.\r\n\r\n_What should be the diet of a nursing mother?_\r\n\r\nShe should have a simple but generous diet with plenty of fluids;\r\nthree regular meals may be given and gruel, milk, or cocoa at bed-time\r\nand sometimes between meals. She may take eggs, cereals, most soups,\r\nand nearly all vegetables, avoiding sour fruits, salads, pastry, and\r\nmost desserts. Meat should not be taken more than twice daily, and in\r\nmany cases but once. She should take but little tea or coffee, and\r\nordinarily no wine or beer.\r\n\r\n_Are fruits likely to disturb a nursing infant?_\r\n\r\nSour fruits in some cases may do so, but sweet fruits and most cooked\r\nfruits are useful.\r\n\r\n_What else is important in the life of the nursing mother?_\r\n\r\nShe should lead a simple natural life; should have regular out-of-door\r\nexercise, preferably walking or driving, as soon after her confinement\r\nas her condition will permit. She should have regular movements from\r\nthe bowels daily. She should be as free as possible from unnecessary\r\ncares and worry; her rest at night should be disturbed as little as\r\npossible; she should lie down for at least one hour in the middle of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n_Does the nervous condition of the mother affect the milk?_\r\n\r\nVery much more than her diet; worry, anxiety, fatigue, loss of sleep,\r\nhousehold cares, social dissipation etc., have more than anything else\r\nto do with the failure of the modern mother as a nurse. Uncontrolled\r\nemotions, grief, excitement, fright, passion, may cause milk to\r\ndisagree with the child; at times they may excite acute illness, and\r\nat other times they may cause a sudden and complete disappearance of\r\nthe milk.\r\n\r\n_Does menstruation affect the milk?_\r\n\r\nIn nearly all cases the quantity of milk is lessened so that the\r\ninfant is not satisfied and may gain less in weight or not at all. In\r\nmany cases the quality of the milk is also affected to such a degree\r\nas to cause slight disturbances of digestion, such as restlessness,\r\ncolic, and perhaps some derangement of the bowels. In a few, attacks\r\nof acute indigestion are excited.\r\n\r\n_Is regular menstruation a reason for stopping nursing?_\r\n\r\nNot invariably; as a rule both functions do not go on together. But if\r\nthe child is gaining regularly in weight between the periods, nursing\r\nmay be continued indefinitely, although it may be well to feed the\r\ninfant wholly or in part during the first day or two that the mother\r\nis unwell.\r\n\r\n_What symptoms indicate that a nursing infant is well nourished?_\r\n\r\nThe child has a good colour, sleeps for two or three hours after\r\nnursing, or, if awake, is quiet, good-natured, and apparently\r\ncomfortable. It has normal movements of the bowels and gains steadily\r\nin weight.\r\n\r\n_What symptoms indicate that a child who is nursing is not properly\r\nnourished?_\r\n\r\nIt does not gain and may even lose in weight. It no longer exhibits\r\nits usual energy and playfulness, but is either listless and\r\nindifferent or cross, fretful and irritable, and is apt to sleep\r\npoorly. It grows pale and anæmic and its tissues become soft and\r\nflabby. When the milk is scanty it will often nurse a long time at the\r\nbreasts, sometimes three quarters of an hour, before stopping. At\r\nother times it may take the breast for a moment only, and then turn\r\naway in apparent disgust.\r\n\r\n_What should be done when such symptoms appear?_\r\n\r\nThis depends upon the severity of the symptoms and how long they have\r\nlasted. If the child has made no gain for three or four weeks, or is\r\nlosing weight, immediate weaning will probably be necessary; in any\r\ncase, other food in addition to the breast milk should be given at\r\nonce. One may begin by alternating the nursing and the bottle-feeding\r\nand increase the number of bottle-feedings as may be indicated by the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n_Is there any objection to a baby being partly nursed and partly fed?_\r\n\r\nNone whatever; it is often better from the outset to feed the baby\r\nduring the night, in order not to disturb the mother's rest.\r\n\r\n_What symptoms indicate that the mother's milk disagrees with the\r\nchild?_\r\n\r\nThe child suffers from almost constant discomfort sleeps; little and\r\nthen restlessly, cries a great deal, belches gas from the stomach, and\r\npasses much by the bowels, or if not passed, the gas accumulates and\r\ncauses abdominal distention and colicky pain. There may be vomiting,\r\nbut more often the trouble is intestinal. Sometimes the bowels are\r\nconstipated, but usually the movements are frequent, loose, green,\r\ncontain mucus and are passed with much gas.\r\n\r\n_What should be done under these circumstances?_\r\n\r\nIf the symptoms have persisted for two or three weeks and the child is\r\nnot gaining in weight, there is little chance of improvement, and the\r\nchild should be taken from the breast at once. If there is some gain\r\nin weight, one may try for a little longer, endeavouring to improve\r\nthe mother's milk by rest, fresh air, careful diet, etc. However, one\r\nshould always realize that the trouble is with the milk, not with the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n_What changes should be made if a nursing infant habitually vomits?_\r\n\r\nIf this occurs soon after nursing, the infant has usually taken too\r\nmuch and the time of nursing should be shortened, or one breast may be\r\ngiven instead of two; the nursing should also be interrupted by\r\noccasional rests, so that the milk is not taken too fast.\r\n\r\nIf the vomiting occurs some time after nursing and is repeated, it is\r\na sign of indigestion; often because the milk is too rich in fat. The\r\nintervals between nursings should then be lengthened; the breast milk\r\nmay be diluted by giving one or two tablespoonfuls of plain boiled\r\nwater, lime-water, or barley-water, five or ten minutes before\r\nnursing; the mother should eat less hearty food, especially less meat.\r\n\r\n_What should be done if the infant has frequent or habitual colic?_\r\n\r\nThis is usually because the milk is too rich in proteids; the mother\r\nshould take more out-of-door exercise, eat less meat, and seek to\r\ncontrol her emotions; all causes of worry should be removed.\r\n\r\n_Can constipation in a nursing infant be controlled through the\r\nmother's milk?_\r\n\r\nOnly to a limited extent. It is important that the mother's bowels be\r\nregular and her digestion good. An increase in the meat and milk of\r\nher diet is sometimes beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEANING\r\n\r\n_At what age should the child be weaned from the breast?_\r\n\r\nUsually weaning should be begun at nine or ten months by substituting\r\none feeding a day for one nursing, later two feedings, and thus\r\ngradually the child is to be taken from the breast altogether.\r\n\r\n_What is the principal reason for weaning earlier?_\r\n\r\nThe most important one is that the child is not thriving--not gaining\r\nin weight and not progressing normally in its development. Serious\r\nillness of the mother, or pregnancy, may make weaning necessary.\r\n\r\n_At what age should the weaning be completed?_\r\n\r\nGenerally at one year. In summer it may sometimes be advisable to\r\nnurse an infant a little longer rather than wean in warm weather; but\r\neven then the dangers of weaning are much less than those of\r\ncontinuing to nurse, as is so often done, after the milk has become\r\nvery scanty and poor in quality.\r\n\r\n_When should a child who is weaned from the breast be taught to drink\r\nfrom the cup, and when to take the bottle?_\r\n\r\nIf weaning is done as early as the eighth or ninth month it is better\r\nto give the bottle; if from the tenth to the twelfth month the infant\r\nshould be taught to drink or be fed with a spoon.\r\n\r\n_How may some of the difficulties in weaning be overcome?_\r\n\r\nBy feeding every nursing infant once a day or by giving it water\r\nregularly from a feeding-bottle. It then becomes accustomed to the\r\nbottle. This is a matter of great convenience during the whole period\r\nof nursing when the mother or nurse is from necessity away from the\r\nchild for a few hours; when more feeding is required at weaning time\r\nthe child does not object.\r\n\r\n_When should a child be weaned from the bottle?_\r\n\r\nWith children who are not ill, weaning from the bottle should\r\ninvariably be begun at the end of the first year, and after a child is\r\nthirteen or fourteen months old the bottle should not be given except\r\nat the night feeding.\r\n\r\n_Is there any objection to the child's taking the bottle until it is\r\ntwo or three years old?_\r\n\r\nThere are no advantages and some serious objections. Older children\r\noften become so attached to the bottle that only with the greatest\r\ndifficulty can they be made to give it up. Frequently they will refuse\r\nall solid food, and will take nothing except from the bottle so long\r\nas it is given, and when finally at three or four years, it is taken\r\naway, they will not touch milk during the rest of their childhood. The\r\ndifficulty is here that children form the \"bottle habit.\" This habit\r\nis troublesome, unnecessary, and should by all means be prevented. An\r\nexclusive diet of milk for children of two or three years often\r\nresults in anæmia and malnutrition.\r\n\r\n_How should one train a child to do without the bottle?_\r\n\r\nThis is usually very easy if it is begun at one year. The milk should\r\nbe poured into a tiny glass or cup and little by little the child is\r\ntaught to drink; at first only a small portion of the food is taken in\r\nthis way, the balance being given from the bottle; but in the course\r\nof a few weeks the average infant learns to drink from a cup without\r\ndifficulty, and all the food can be so given.\r\n\r\nIf the child is two or more years old, the only effective means of\r\nweaning from the bottle is through hunger. The bottle should be taken\r\naway at once and entirely, and nothing allowed except milk from a cup\r\nuntil the child takes this willingly. Sometimes a child will go an\r\nentire day without food, occasionally as long as two days, but one\r\nshould not be alarmed on this account and yield. This is a matter of\r\nthe child's will and not of his digestion, and when once he has been\r\nconquered it is seldom that any further trouble is experienced. As\r\nsoon as a child has learned to drink his milk from a cup, cereals and\r\nother solid foods may gradually be added to the diet. The educational\r\nvalue of such training is not the least important consideration.\r\n\r\n_Can a baby just weaned take cow's milk of the same proportions as one\r\nof the same age who has had cow's milk from birth?_\r\n\r\nVery rarely; to give a baby who has had nothing but the breast from\r\nbirth, plain cow's milk, or even that milk which a bottle-fed baby of\r\nthe same age might take, is almost certain to cause indigestion. The\r\nchange in the food is quite a marked one, and should be made gradually\r\nby beginning with a very weak milk and increasing its strength as the\r\nbaby becomes accustomed to take cow's milk.\r\n\r\n_What would be the proper proportions for an infant weaned at four or\r\nfive months?_\r\n\r\nAbout the same as for a healthy bottle-fed infant of two months; the\r\nquantity of course should be larger. The food can in most cases be\r\ngradually increased so that in two or three weeks the usual strength\r\nfor the age can be taken.\r\n\r\n_What would be the proper proportions for an infant weaned at nine or\r\nten months?_\r\n\r\nAbout the same as for a bottle-fed infant at four or five months, to\r\nbe increased as indicated above.\r\n\r\n_Will not a child lose in weight when placed upon so low a diet?_\r\n\r\nVery often it will do so for the first week or two, but after that\r\nwill gain quite regularly; the acute indigestion, however, which\r\ngenerally accompanies the use of stronger milk will, in most cases,\r\ncause a greater loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL FEEDING\r\n\r\n_What foods contain all the elements present in mother's milk?_\r\n\r\nThe milk of other animals,--cow's milk being the only one which is\r\navailable for general use.\r\n\r\n_Is it not possible for infants to thrive upon other foods than those\r\ncontaining fresh milk?_\r\n\r\nThey may do so for a time, but never permanently. The long-continued\r\nuse of other foods as the sole diet is attended with great risk.\r\n\r\n_What are the dangers of such foods?_\r\n\r\nFrequently scurvy is produced (see page 141), often rickets, and in\r\nother cases simply a condition of general malnutrition,--the child\r\ndoes not thrive, is pale, and its muscles are soft and flabby.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SELECTION AND CARE OF MILK USED FOR INFANT FEEDING\r\n\r\n_What are the essential points in milk selected for the feeding of\r\ninfants?_\r\n\r\nThat it comes from healthy cows, and that it is clean and fresh.\r\n\r\n_Is it not important to select a rich milk?_\r\n\r\nBy no means; in fact the very rich milk of highly bred Jerseys and\r\nAlderneys has not been found nearly so satisfactory in infant feeding\r\nas that from some other herds, such, for example, as the common \"grade\r\ncows.\"\r\n\r\n_Which is the better, milk from one cow or the mixed milk of several\r\ncows?_\r\n\r\nThe mixed, or \"herd milk,\" is usually to be preferred since it varies\r\nlittle from day to day; while that from a single cow may vary\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n_How fresh is it important that cow's milk should be for the best\r\nresults in infant feeding?_\r\n\r\nThis depends very much upon the season, and how carefully milk is\r\nhandled. As ordinarily handled at the dairy and in the home, milk\r\nshould not be used for infants in winter after it is forty-eight hours\r\nold; in summer not after it is twenty-four hours old, and it may be\r\nunsafe in a much shorter time. When handled with especial care milk\r\nmay be safe for a longer time.\r\n\r\n_What are the two essentials in handling milk?_\r\n\r\n1. That it be kept clean and free from contamination. This\r\nnecessitates that cows, stables, and milkers be clean, and that\r\ntransportation be in sealed bottles; also that those who handle the\r\nmilk do not come in contact with any contagious disease. All\r\nmilk-pails, bottles, cans, and other utensils with which the milk\r\ncomes in contact should be sterilized shortly before they are used,\r\nby steam or boiling water.\r\n\r\n2. That it be cooled immediately after leaving the cows, and kept at\r\nas low a temperature as possible; to be efficient this should not be\r\nabove 50° F.\r\n\r\nMilk produced under hygienic conditions and handled with special care\r\nis sold in bottles in a number of cities under the name of\r\n\"certified,\" \"guaranteed,\" or \"inspected\" milk. When available such\r\nmilk should be used for infants. Of course the extra care bestowed in\r\nits production and transportation increases the cost of the milk, but\r\nthe best will usually be found in the end to be the cheapest.\r\n\r\n_How should milk be handled in the home when obtained fresh from the\r\ncows?_\r\n\r\nThat to be used for infants should be strained through a thick layer\r\nof absorbent cotton or several thicknesses of cheese-cloth into quart\r\nglass jars or milk bottles which should be covered and cooled\r\nimmediately best by placing the bottles quite up to their necks in ice\r\nwater or cold spring water, where they should stand for at least half\r\nan hour. That required for children who take plain milk may now be\r\npoured into half-pint bottles, stopped with cotton, and put in the\r\nice-chest, or the coolest place possible. This first rapid cooling is\r\nvery important and adds much to the keeping qualities of the milk.\r\nMilk loses its heat very quickly when cooled in water, but very slowly\r\nwhen it is simply placed in a cold room. After standing four or five\r\nhours the top-milk may be removed; after twelve to sixteen hours the\r\ncream may be removed.\r\n\r\n_How should milk be handled when bottled milk is purchased?_\r\n\r\nIt should be cooled as just described, as its temperature is usually\r\nsomewhat raised during transportation If it has been bottled at a\r\ndairy, the cream or the top-milk may be removed after an hour or so.\r\n\r\n_How should milk and cream be handled when they are purchased in\r\nbulk?_\r\n\r\nSuch milk should never be used for infants when it is possible to\r\nobtain bottled milk, as it is much more liable to contamination. Both\r\ncream and milk should be poured at once into covered vessels and kept\r\nin the coolest place possible. The cream and top-milk will seldom rise\r\nupon such milk with any satisfactory regularity.\r\n\r\n_What are the important things to be secured in nursery\r\nrefrigerators?_\r\n\r\nAbsolute cleanliness is essential; hence the inner portion should be\r\nof metal. Those made entirely of metal are unsatisfactory as in them\r\nthe ice melts very quickly. If the ordinary metal refrigerator sold is\r\nencased in a wooden box, we have the best form. Another easy way of\r\nsecuring the same result Is to make for the refrigerator a covering or\r\n\"cosey\" of felt or heavy quilting, which can be easily removed when\r\nwet or soiled.\r\n\r\nThe compartments of the refrigerator should be so arranged that the\r\nbottles of milk are either in contact with the ice or very near it.\r\nThe supply of ice should be abundant. Often the amount of ice is so\r\nsmall, and the bottles so far away, that the temperature of the milk\r\nis never below 60° or 65° F. To be really effective a refrigerator\r\nshould have a temperature where the milk is placed of not over 50° F.\r\nThe temperature should be tested with the nursery thermometer from\r\ntime to time to ascertain what results are being obtained. Spoiled\r\nmilk owing to a faulty refrigerator is to be blamed for many attacks\r\nof acute illness among infants. Next to the feeding-bottles it is the\r\none thing in the nursery which should receive the closest attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODIFICATION OF COW'S MILK\r\n\r\n_Can cow's milk be fed to infants without any changes?_\r\n\r\nNo; for although it contains similar elements to those in mother's\r\nmilk, they are not identical, and they are not present in the same\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\n_Is this a matter of much importance?_\r\n\r\nIt is of the greatest importance. There are few infants who can digest\r\ncow's milk unless it is changed. To change cow's milk so as to make it\r\nmore nearly resemble mother's milk is called _modifying_ cow's milk.\r\n\r\n_How is this milk whose proportions have been changed distinguished\r\nfrom the original unchanged milk?_\r\n\r\nThe changed milk is usually called \"modified milk\"? the original\r\nunchanged milk is known as \"plain milk,\" \"whole milk,\" \"straight\r\nmilk,\" or is referred to simply as \"milk.\"\r\n\r\n_What are the principal differences between cow's milk and mother's\r\nmilk?_\r\n\r\nCow's milk has a little more than half as much sugar; it has nearly\r\nthree times as much proteids and salts; its proteids are different and\r\nmuch more difficult of digestion; its reaction is decidedly acid, that\r\nof mother's milk is faintly acid or neutral.\r\n\r\n_Are there any other important things to be considered?_\r\n\r\nYes; mother's milk is always fed fresh and is practically sterile.\r\nCow's milk is generally kept twenty-four hours and sometimes much\r\nlonger. It is always to a greater or less degree contaminated by dirt\r\nand germs, the number of which increases rapidly (1) with the age of\r\nthe milk; (2) in proportion to amount of the dust or dirt which enters\r\nit; (3) with any increase in the temperature at which the milk is\r\nkept.\r\n\r\nIt is just as important for success in infant feeding that these\r\nconditions receive attention as that the proportions of the different\r\nelements of the milk are right.\r\n\r\n_How is the acidity of cow's milk overcome?_\r\n\r\nBy the addition of lime-water or bicarbonate of soda. If lime-water is\r\nused, one ounce to twenty ounces of food is generally required; if\r\nsoda is used, twenty grains to twenty ounces of food.\r\n\r\nIf there is a tendency to constipation the milk of magnesia\r\n(Phillips's) may be used; from one half to one teaspoonful being added\r\nto each twenty ounces of food.\r\n\r\n_How is the sugar best increased?_\r\n\r\nBy adding milk sugar to the food; one ounce to each twenty ounces of\r\nfood will give the proper quantity for the first three or four months.\r\nThis will make the proportion about the same (between 6 and 7 per\r\ncent) as in mother's milk.\r\n\r\n_How should the sugar be prepared?_\r\n\r\nSimply dissolved in boiled water; if the solution is not clear, or if\r\nthere is a deposit after standing, it should be filtered by pouring\r\nthrough a layer of absorbent cotton, half an inch thick, which is\r\nplaced in an ordinary funnel.\r\n\r\n_Will not cane (granulated) sugar answer as well?_\r\n\r\nNot as a rule; however, there are many infants who get on very well\r\nwhen cane sugar is used. It has the advantage of being much cheaper. A\r\ngood grade of milk sugar is somewhat expensive, costing from\r\ntwenty-five to sixty cents a pound, and cheap samples are apt to\r\ncontain impurities.\r\n\r\n_If cane sugar is used, what amount should be added?_\r\n\r\nConsiderably less than of the milk sugar. Usually about half the\r\nquantity (half an ounce to twenty ounces of food) is as much as most\r\ninfants can digest If the same quantity is used as of the milk sugar,\r\nthe food is made unduly sweet, and the sugar is likely to ferment in\r\nthe stomach and cause colic.\r\n\r\n_Is not the purpose of the sugar to sweeten the food in order to make\r\nit palatable?_\r\n\r\nNot at all; although it does that, its real use is to furnish one of\r\nthe essential elements needed for the growth of the body, and the one\r\nthat is required by young infants in the largest quantity.\r\n\r\n_How do we know that this is so?_\r\n\r\nBy the fact that in good breast milk the amount of sugar is greater\r\nthan that of the fat, proteids, and salts combined.\r\n\r\n_We have seen that cow's milk has nearly three times as much proteids\r\n(curd) and salts as mother's milk. How are these to be diminished?_\r\n\r\nBy diluting the milk.\r\n\r\n_Will it be sufficient to dilute the milk twice (i.e., add two parts\r\nof water to one part of milk)?_\r\n\r\nNot for a very young infant. Although this will give about the\r\nquantity of proteids present in mother's milk, the proteids of cow's\r\nmilk are so much more difficult for the infant to digest, that in the\r\nbeginning it should be diluted five or six times for most infants.\r\n\r\n_If cow's milk is properly diluted and lime-water and sugar added does\r\nit then resemble mother's milk?_\r\n\r\nNo; the mixture contains too little fat.\r\n\r\n_What is the easiest way of overcoming this?_\r\n\r\nBy increasing the fat in the milk before dilution. It may be done by\r\nusing top-milk or a mixture of milk and cream.\r\n\r\n_What is top-milk?_\r\n\r\nIt is the upper layer of milk removed after standing a certain number\r\nof hours in a milk bottle, glass jar, or any tall vessel with straight\r\nsides. It contains most of the cream and some of the milk just below.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the top-milk is measured by the fat it contains--e.g.,\r\na 10-per-cent milk contains 10 per cent fat; 7-per-cent milk contains\r\n7 per cent fat, etc. These are the two strengths of top milk most used\r\nin infant feeding.\r\n\r\n_On what does the percentage of fat in top-milk depend?_\r\n\r\n1. On the length of time the milk has stood.\r\n\r\n2. On the manner in which the top-milk is removed.\r\n\r\n3. On the number of ounces removed.\r\n\r\n4. On the richness of the milk used.\r\n\r\nUnless these are known it is impossible to say even approximately how\r\nstrong in fat the top-milk is.\r\n\r\n_When and how should top-milk be removed?_\r\n\r\nIf milk fresh from the cow, or before the cream has risen, is put into\r\nbottles and rapidly cooled, the top-milk may be removed in as short a\r\ntime as four hours. In the case of bottled milk it makes little\r\ndifference if it stands a longer time, even until the next day. The\r\nbest means of removing it is by a small cream-dipper[2] holding one\r\nounce; although it may be taken off by a spoon or siphon. It should\r\nnot be poured off.\r\n\r\n    [2] Obtained from any of the Walker-Gordon milk laboratories,\r\n    from James Dougherty, No. 411 West 59th Street, New York, and\r\n    from many druggists. Price, 20 cents.\r\n\r\n_How can we obtain a 10-per-cent top-milk with the different kinds of\r\ncow's milk?_\r\n\r\nFrom a rather poor milk (containing 3--3-1/2 per cent fat) by removing\r\nthe upper eight ounces from a quart, or one fourth.\r\n\r\nFrom a good average milk (containing 4 per cent fat) by removing the\r\nupper eleven ounces from a quart, or about one third.\r\n\r\nFrom a rich Jersey milk (containing 5--5-1/2 per cent fat) by removing\r\nthe upper sixteen ounces, or one half.\r\n\r\n_How can we obtain a 7-per-cent top-milk with the different kinds of\r\ncow's milk?_\r\n\r\nFrom a rather poor milk, by removing the upper eleven ounces from a\r\nquart, about one third.\r\n\r\nFrom a good average milk, by removing the upper sixteen ounces, or one\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nFrom a rich Jersey milk, by removing the upper twenty-two ounces, or\r\nabout two thirds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The percentage of fat in the different layers of milk\r\nof good average quality.]\r\n\r\n_What is cream?_\r\n\r\nCream is often spoken of as if it were the fat in milk. It is really\r\nthe part of the milk which contains most of the fat. It differs from\r\nmilk chiefly in containing much more fat.\r\n\r\n_In what ways is cream now obtained?_\r\n\r\n(1) By skimming, after the milk has stood usually for twenty-four\r\nhours? this is known as \"gravity cream.\" (2) By an apparatus known as\r\na separator; this is known as \"centrifugal cream\"; most of the cream\r\nnow sold in cities is of this kind. The richness of any cream is\r\nindicated by the amount of fat it contains.\r\n\r\nThe usual gravity cream sold has from 16 to 20 per cent fat. The cream\r\nremoved from the upper part (one fifth) of a bottle of milk has about\r\n16 per cent fat. The usual centrifugal cream has 18 to 20 per cent\r\nfat. The heavy centrifugal cream has 35 to 40 per cent fat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD FOR HEALTHY INFANTS[3]--THE EARLY MONTHS\r\n\r\n    [3] The directions and formulas given in the following pages\r\n    are intended only for guidance in feeding children who\r\n    are not suffering from any special disturbance of digestion;\r\n    directions for such conditions are given in a later chapter.\r\n\r\n_What are the most important points to be remembered in modifying\r\ncow's milk for feeding during the early months?_\r\n\r\nThat of the different ingredients of milk the sugar is most easily\r\ndigested; the fat is next; while the proteids are the most difficult.\r\n\r\n_What relation should the fat bear to the proteids during this\r\nperiod?_\r\n\r\nFor most infants with good digestion the best results are obtained\r\nwhen the fat is three times the proteids. However, this is not true of\r\nall. There are many healthy infants who are unable to digest this\r\nproportion of fat, and who do much better when the fat is made only\r\ntwice the proteids.\r\n\r\n_How can one obtain formulas in which the fat is three times the\r\nproteids?_\r\n\r\nBy using for dilution a 10-per-cent milk (i.e., milk containing 10 per\r\ncent fat) which serves as the primary formula from which all the other\r\nformulas of this series are derived.\r\n\r\nIn 10-per-cent milk the fat is just three times the proteids.\r\n\r\n_How can one get the 10-per-cent milk?_\r\n\r\n(1) As top-milk, as described on page 64; or, (2) by mixing equal\r\nparts of plain milk and ordinary cream (containing about 16 per cent\r\nfat); (3) from any of the milk laboratories it may be ordered\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n_Is it better to obtain the 10-per-cent milk by using a mixture of\r\nmilk and cream, or as top-milk?_\r\n\r\nIf one can get milk fresh from the cows, the top-milk is to be\r\npreferred on account of freshness. The food can then be made up when\r\nthe milk is but a few hours old. In cities, if one uses bottled milk,\r\nthe upper third may also be used. But if one buys milk and cream\r\nseparately, it is usually more convenient to mix these, as the cream\r\nwill not rise upon milk a second time with any uniformity.\r\n\r\n_How can one obtain formulas in which the fat is twice the\r\nproteids?_\r\n\r\nBy using for dilution a 7-per-cent milk (i.e., milk containing 7 per\r\ncent fat) which serves as the primary formula from which all the other\r\nformulas of this series are derived.\r\n\r\nIn 7-per-cent milk the fat is just twice the proteids.\r\n\r\n_How can one get the 7-per-cent milk?_\r\n\r\n(1) As top-milk, as described on page 64; or, (2) by mixing three\r\nparts of milk and one part of ordinary (16 per cent) cream; (3) from\r\nany of the milk laboratories it may be obtained directly. As in the\r\ncase of 10-per-cent milk, the top-milk is generally to be preferred to\r\na mixture of milk and cream.\r\n\r\n_How should the food be prepared during the early months?_\r\n\r\nIt is convenient in calculation to make up twenty ounces of food at a\r\ntime. The first step is to obtain the 10-per-cent milk or the\r\n7-per-cent milk to be used as the primary formula. Then to take the\r\nnumber of ounces of this that are called for in the formula desired.\r\n\r\nNote.--One should not make the mistake of taking from the top of the\r\nbottle only the number of ounces needed in the formula as this may\r\ngive quite a different result.\r\n\r\nThere will be required in addition one ounce of milk sugar[4] and one\r\nounce of lime-water in each twenty ounces. The rest of the food will\r\nbe made up of boiled water.\r\n\r\n    [4] If the milk sugar be measured in the milk-dipper, two scant\r\n    dipperfuls may be calculated as one ounce. If measured in a\r\n    tablespoon, three even tablespoonfuls may be calculated as one\r\n    ounce.\r\n\r\nThese formulas written out would be as follows:\r\n\r\n  _First Series_\r\n\r\n  _Formulas for the Early Months from 10-per-cent Milk_\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n                       I.

With a smaller, less vigorous child, whose digestion is\r\nnot so good, or with one who does not do well upon the First Series,\r\nthe Second Series should be used.\r\n\r\n_Why is it necessary to make the food so weak at first?_\r\n\r\nBecause the infant's stomach is intended to digest breast milk, not\r\ncow's milk; but if we begin with a very weak cow's milk the stomach\r\ncan be gradually trained to digest it. If we began with a strong milk\r\nthe digestion might be seriously upset.\r\n\r\n_How rapidly can the food be increased in strength from Formula I to\r\nII, from II to III, etc.?_\r\n\r\nNo absolute rule can be given. Usually we begin with I on the second\r\nday; II on the fourth day; III at one week or ten days; but after that\r\nmake the increase more slowly. A large infant with a strong digestion\r\nwill bear a rather rapid increase and may be able to take V by the\r\ntime it is three or four weeks old. A child with a feeble digestion\r\nmust go much slower and may not reach V before it is three or four\r\nmonths old.\r\n\r\nIt is important with all children that the increase in the food be\r\nmade very gradually. It may be best with many infants to increase the\r\nmilk by only half an ounce in twenty ounces of food, instead of one\r\nounce at a time as indicated in the tables. Thus from 3 ounces, the\r\nincrease would be to 3½ ounces; from 4 ounces to 4½ ounces, etc. At\r\nleast two or three days should be allowed between each increase in the\r\nstrength of the food.\r\n\r\n_What general rule can be given for increasing the food?_\r\n\r\nTo increase when the infant is not satisfied but is digesting well.\r\n\r\n_How does an infant show that he is not satisfied?_\r\n\r\nHe drains the bottle eagerly and cries when it is taken away. He often\r\nforms the habit of sucking his fingers immediately after. He begins to\r\nfret half an hour or an hour before the next feeding is due.\r\n\r\n_In the series of formulas given in the table the quantities are\r\nmentioned for making only twenty ounces of food. How should it be\r\nprepared when more than this quantity is needed?_\r\n\r\nIt is equally convenient to make up 25 ounces, 30 ounces, 35 ounces,\r\nor 40 ounces at a time.\r\n\r\n  To make--\r\n\r\n  25 ounces of any formula add one quarter more of each ingredient.\r\n  30     \"         \"           one half             \"       \"\r\n  35     \"         \"           three quarters       \"       \"\r\n  40     \"         \"           twice as much        \"       \"\r\n\r\nThus 25 ounces of Formula I would be obtained by using 2½ ounces of\r\nmilk, 1¼ ounces of sugar and lime-water, 21¼ ounces of water; 30\r\nounces of the same would require 3 ounces milk, 1½ ounces lime-water\r\nand sugar, and 25½ ounces water; 35 ounces would require 3½ ounces\r\nmilk, 1¾ ounces lime-water and sugar, and 29¾ ounces water. The amount\r\nof water need not be calculated in any case, but after measuring\r\ncarefully the other ingredients enough water should be added to bring\r\nthe total up to the amount required.\r\n\r\n_How great an increase in the quantity should be made at one time?_\r\n\r\nOne may make up five ounces additional food; but the first two days\r\nonly two or three ounces of the additional amount should be given; the\r\nnext two days, four ounces; after two days more, the five ounces may\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the quantity given at a single feeding should not be\r\nmore than a quarter of an ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD FOR HEALTHY INFANTS--THE LATER MONTHS\r\n\r\n_How long should the fat be as much as three times the proteids?_\r\n\r\nThis is seldom of advantage longer than three or four months.\r\n\r\n_What changes should then be made in the milk?_\r\n\r\nAfter Formula V of the First Series (6 ounces of 10-per-cent milk in\r\n20 ounces of food) has been reached, the fat should be increased very\r\nslowly for this proportion (3 per cent) is near the limit for most\r\nhealthy children. The milk should now be strengthened chiefly by\r\nraising the percentage of proteids.\r\n\r\n_How is this accomplished?_\r\n\r\nThe 10-per-cent milk and the formulas derived from it should now be\r\ndiscontinued, and those made from 7-per-cent milk used.\r\n\r\n  _Third Series_\r\n\r\n  _Formulas for the Later Months from 7-per-cent Milk_\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n                       I.

When IV or V has been reached, the same\r\nformula may sometimes be continued for three or four months with no\r\nother change than an increase in the quantity.\r\n\r\n_In passing from Formula V of the First Series to Formula I of the\r\nThird Series the proportion of fat is at first reduced. Is this\r\nnecessary or important?_\r\n\r\nNo; it only happens to come so in simplifying the calculation. It may\r\nbe avoided by taking off at first the upper 13 ounces as top-milk and\r\nusing 7 ounces of this in a 20-ounce mixture, in place of Formula I;\r\nand by using for the next increase the upper 15 ounces as top-milk,\r\ntaking of this 8 ounces in a 20-ounce mixture in place of Formula II.\r\nThen should follow Formula III.\r\n\r\n_What further addition may be made to the food of the later months?_\r\n\r\nUsually about the sixth or seventh month, farinaceous food in the form\r\nof gruel may be added, this taking the place of part of the water and\r\npart of the sugar.\r\n\r\n_What changes may be made in the food when the infant has reached the\r\nage of ten or eleven months?_\r\n\r\nThe proteids may be still further increased, and the sugar and the\r\nlime-water reduced until plain milk is given.\r\n\r\n_How may this best be done?_\r\n\r\nAt first one feeding a day of plain milk and barley gruel may be\r\ngiven; later, two feedings; then three feedings, etc. Let us suppose\r\nan infant to be taking such a modified milk as Formula IV or V (page\r\n76), six feedings a day. The plain milk diluted only with barley gruel\r\nwould at first replace one of these feedings; then two, three, four,\r\netc., these changes being made at intervals of about two weeks. The\r\nproportions of the milk and barley gruel should at first be about\r\n5-1/2 ounces milk, 2-1/2 ounces barley; later, 6 ounces milk, 3 ounces\r\nbarley; still later, 7 ounces milk, 2 ounces barley, until finally\r\nplain milk is given to drink and the cereals given separately with a\r\nspoon. This is reached with most infants at fourteen or fifteen\r\nmonths; with many at twelve or thirteen months. Other forms of\r\nfarinaceous food may of course be used in the place of the barley, and\r\nin the same proportions.\r\n\r\nWith some infants the addition of a pinch of bicarbonate of soda may\r\nbe advantageously made to each milk-feeding when the lime-water is\r\nomitted, but with most this is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIf the infant strongly objects to the taste of the milk when the milk\r\nsugar has been omitted, a small quantity (one fourth to one half\r\nteaspoonful) of granulated sugar may for a time be added to each\r\nfeeding, then gradually reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULES FOR GUIDANCE IN THE USE OF THE FORMULAS GIVEN\r\n\r\nIt should again be emphasized that these formulas are not intended for\r\nsick children nor for those suffering from any marked symptoms of\r\nindigestion. For such infants special rules are given later.\r\n\r\n_What should be the guide in deciding upon a formula with which to\r\nbegin for a child who is to be artificially fed?_\r\n\r\nThe age and the weight are of some importance, but the best guide is\r\nthe condition of the child's digestive organs. One should always begin\r\nwith a weak formula, particularly, (1) with an infant previously\r\nbreast fed; (2) with one just weaned, as a child who has never had\r\ncow's milk must at first have weaker proportions than the age and the\r\nweight would seem to indicate; (3) with infants whose power of\r\ndigestion is unknown. If the first formula tried is weaker than the\r\nchild can digest, the food can be strengthened every three or four\r\ndays until it is found what the child is able to take. On the\r\ncontrary, if the food is made too strong at first, an attack of\r\nindigestion will probably follow.\r\n\r\n_How should the food be increased in strength?_\r\n\r\nThe first essential is that it be done very gradually; abruptly\r\nincreasing the food usually causes a disturbance of digestion.\r\n\r\nIt is never wise to advance more rapidly in strengthening the food\r\nthan from one formula to the next one in any of the series given; with\r\nmany infants it is better to make the steps of increase only half as\r\ngreat as those indicated (page 72).\r\n\r\n_How rapidly should the food be increased in quantity?_\r\n\r\nThe increase should not be more than a quarter of an ounce in each\r\nfeeding; or from one and a half to two ounces in a day.\r\n\r\n_When should the food be increased?_\r\n\r\nIn the early weeks an increase may be necessary every few days; in the\r\nlater months sometimes the same formula may be continued for two or\r\nthree months. It is, however, impossible to give a definite rule as to\r\ntime. One cannot say with any child that an increase is to be made\r\nevery week or every two weeks. A much better guide are the conditions\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe signs indicating that the food should be increased are, that the\r\ninfant is not satisfied, not gaining in weight, but is digesting well,\r\ni.e., not vomiting, and having good stools. One should not increase\r\nthe food, however, so long as the child seems perfectly satisfied and\r\nis gaining from four to six ounces a week, even though both the\r\nquantity and the strength of the food are considerably below the\r\naverage; nor should the food be increased if the child is gaining from\r\neight to ten ounces a week, even if he seems somewhat hungry. The\r\nappetite is not always a safe guide to follow.\r\n\r\n_How can one know whether the strength or the quantity of the food\r\nshould be increased?_\r\n\r\nIn the early weeks it is well first to increase the strength of the\r\nfood, the next time to increase the quantity, then the strength again,\r\netc. After the fourth or fifth month, the quantity, chiefly, should be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n_If a slight disturbance or discomfort occurs after the food has been\r\nstrengthened, is it best to go back to the weaker formula or to\r\npersist with the new one?_\r\n\r\nSymptoms of minor discomfort are seen for a day or two with many\r\ninfants after an ordinary increase in food; but in most cases an\r\ninfant soon becomes accustomed to the stronger food and is able to\r\ndigest it. If, however, the symptoms of disturbance are marked, one\r\nshould promptly go back to the weaker formula. The next increase\r\nshould be a smaller one.\r\n\r\n_Should one be disturbed if for the first two or three weeks of\r\nartificial feeding the gain in weight is very slight or even if there\r\nis none?_\r\n\r\nNot as a rule. If the infant does not lose weight, is perfectly\r\ncomfortable, sleeps most of the time, and does not suffer from any\r\nsymptoms of indigestion, such as colic, vomiting, etc., one may be\r\nsure that all is going well and that the infant is becoming used to\r\nhis new food. As the child's appetite improves and his digestion is\r\nstronger, the food may be increased every few days and very soon the\r\ngain in weight will come and will then be continuous. If, however, the\r\nscales are watched too closely and, because there is only a slight\r\ngain in weight or none at all, the food is rapidly increased, an acute\r\ndisturbance of digestion is pretty certain to follow.\r\n\r\n_Is not constipation likely to occur if the child is on a very weak\r\nfood?_\r\n\r\nIt is very often seen and is due simply to the small amount of residue\r\nin the intestine. Under these circumstances, if the bowels move once\r\nevery day, one should not be disturbed even when the movements are\r\nsmall and somewhat dry. As the food is gradually strengthened, this\r\nconstipation soon passes off; while if injections, suppositories, or\r\ncathartics are used to produce freer movements, the functions of the\r\nbowels are likely to be disturbed.\r\n\r\n_Under what circumstances should the food be reduced?_\r\n\r\nWhenever the child becomes ill from any cause whatever, or whenever\r\nany marked symptoms of indigestion arise.\r\n\r\n_How may this be done?_\r\n\r\nIf the disturbance is only a moderate one and the food has been made\r\nup for the day, one third may be poured off from the top of each\r\nbottle just before it is given, and this quantity of food replaced by\r\nthe same amount of boiled water.\r\n\r\nIf the disturbance is more severe, the food should be immediately\r\ndiluted by at least one half and at the same time the quantity given\r\nshould be reduced.\r\n\r\nFor a severe acute attack of indigestion the regular food should be\r\nomitted altogether and only water given until the doctor has been\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n_If the food has been reduced for a disturbance of digestion, how\r\nshould one return to the original formula?_\r\n\r\nWhile the reduction of the food should be immediate and considerable,\r\nthe increase should be very gradual. After a serious attack of acute\r\nindigestion, when beginning with milk again, it should not be made\r\nmore than one fifth the original strength, and from ten days to two\r\nweeks should pass before the child is brought back to his original\r\nfood, which should be done very gradually. It is surprising how long a\r\ntime is required with young infants before they completely recover\r\nfrom an attack of acute indigestion, even though it did not seem to be\r\nvery severe. The second disturbance always comes from a slighter cause\r\nthan the first one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADDITION OF OTHER FOODS TO MILK\r\n\r\n_How long should modified milk be continued without the addition of\r\nother food?_\r\n\r\nThis depends upon circumstances; usually, for about six months; but if\r\nthe infant is thriving satisfactorily the milk may be used alone for\r\nten or eleven months; with some infants who have especial difficulty\r\nin digesting cow's milk, it is advisable to begin the use of other\r\nfood at three or four months or even from the outset.\r\n\r\n_What is the first thing to be used with milk?_\r\n\r\nFarinaceous food in some form, usually as a gruel.\r\n\r\n_How are these gruels made?_\r\n\r\nThey may be made directly from the grains or from some of the prepared\r\nflours (page 149). The flours are usually to be preferred as being\r\nmore simple of preparation.\r\n\r\n_How should they be used in making the food?_\r\n\r\nThey should be cooked separately, rather than with the milk; when the\r\nfood is mixed, they take the place of a portion of the water in the\r\nformulas given on pages 70 and 71.\r\n\r\n_How much of the gruel should be used?_\r\n\r\nIf it is prepared as recommended on page 149, it may make according to\r\ncircumstances from one sixth to one half the total quantity of food.\r\n\r\n_Which of the farinaceous foods are to be preferred?_\r\n\r\nThose most used are barley, oatmeal, arrowroot, and farina. There is\r\nnot much difference in their nutritive value; oatmeal gruel is\r\nsomewhat more laxative.\r\n\r\n_What value do these substances possess as infant foods?_\r\n\r\nSome of the starch is digested and absorbed; but the chief value of\r\ngruels is believed to be that when added to milk they render the curd\r\nmore easily digested by preventing it from coagulating in the stomach\r\nin large tough masses. This is certainly true with many infants, but\r\nthere are others who are not at all benefited, and not a few young\r\ninfants whose digestion is made distinctly worse by the use of\r\nfarinaceous food, particularly when employed in considerable quantity.\r\nThe addition of gruels to milk for all infants is not to be\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n_What further additions may be made to the diet of healthy infants\r\nduring the first year?_\r\n\r\nBeef juice, the white of egg, and orange juice.\r\n\r\n_How and when may beef juice be used?_\r\n\r\nWith infants who are strong and thriving satisfactorily it may be\r\nbegun at ten or eleven months; two teaspoonfuls may be given daily,\r\ndiluted with the same quantity of water, fifteen minutes before the\r\nmidday feeding; in two weeks the quantity may be doubled; and in four\r\nweeks six teaspoonfuls may be given. The maximum quantity at one year\r\nshould not be more than two or three tablespoonfuls.\r\n\r\nWith delicate infants who are pale and anæmic, beef juice is more\r\nimportant, and it may often be wisely begun at five or six months in\r\nhalf the quantities mentioned.\r\n\r\n_When should white of egg be used?_\r\n\r\nUnder the same conditions as beef juice, particularly with infants who\r\nhave difficulty in digesting the proteins (curd) of milk. At six\r\nmonths half the white of one egg may be given at one time, and soon\r\nafter this the entire white of one egg. The best in manner of cooking\r\nis the \"coddled\", egg (see page 151).\r\n\r\n_When should orange juice be begun?_\r\n\r\nUsually about the eleventh or twelfth month; it should be given about\r\none hour before the feeding; two teaspoonfuls at first, then one\r\ntablespoonful at a time, and later three or four tablespoonfuls. It is\r\nparticularly useful when there is constipation. It should always be\r\nstrained, and care should be taken that it is sweet and fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVERFEEDING\r\n\r\n_What is meant by overfeeding?_\r\n\r\nGiving an infant too much food; either too much at one time or too\r\nfrequently. Overfeeding is sometimes practised during the day, but is\r\nchiefly done at night.\r\n\r\n_Is not an infant's natural desire for food a proper guide as to the\r\nquantity given?_\r\n\r\nThe appetite of a perfectly normal infant usually is; but overeating\r\nis a habit gradually acquired and may continue until twice as much\r\nfood as is proper is taken in the twenty-four hours. This habit is\r\nmost frequently seen in infants whose digestion is not quite normal;\r\nbecause of the temporary relief from discomfort experienced by taking\r\nfood into the stomach, they often appear to be hungry the greater part\r\nof the time, especially at night.\r\n\r\n_What are the causes of overfeeding?_\r\n\r\nThe most common one is the habit of watching the weight too closely,\r\nand the conviction on the part of the mother or nurse that because a\r\nchild is not so large nor gaining so rapidly as some other infant of\r\nthe same age, more food or stronger food should be given.\r\n\r\n_What harm results from overfeeding?_\r\n\r\nAll food taken in excess of what a child can digest becomes a burden\r\nto him. The food lies in the stomach or bowels undigested, ferments,\r\nand causes wind and colic. When overfeeding is longer continued,\r\nserious disturbances of digestion are soon produced. The infant is\r\nrestless, fretful, constantly uncomfortable, sleeps badly, and stops\r\ngaining and may even lose in weight. Such symptoms may lead to the\r\nmistaken conclusion that too little food is given, and it is\r\naccordingly increased, when it should be diminished. One of the\r\nresults of long-continued overfeeding is dilatation or stretching of\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\n_What should guide one as to the quantity of food to be given to any\r\ninfant??_\r\n\r\n(1) The size of the infant's stomach at the different months; (2) the\r\namount of milk which the healthy nursing infant gets; (3) the\r\nquantities with which most children do best. The table of quantities\r\nand intervals of feeding, on page 108, gives the average figures\r\nderived from these sources. It is seldom wise to go beyond the limits\r\nthere stated; nor should one insist upon giving any fixed amount if it\r\nis clearly more than the child wants or can be made to take except by\r\ncontinued coaxing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF APPETITE\r\n\r\n_What is to be done when without any other signs of illness a child's\r\nappetite gradually fails?_\r\n\r\nThis is often the result of a long period of overfeeding or the use of\r\nmilk too rich in fat. If in all other respects the child seems well\r\nand simply does not want his food, it should be offered at regular\r\nhours, but not more frequently; on no account should he be coaxed,\r\nmuch less forced, to eat, even though he takes only one half or one\r\nthird the usual quantity. The intervals between feedings should not be\r\nshortened but rather lengthened. Often, with a child a year old, it is\r\nnecessary to reduce the number of feedings to four or even three in\r\ntwenty-four hours. Water, however, may be offered at more frequent\r\nintervals. The food should be weakened rather than strengthened. No\r\ngreater mistake can be made than, because so little is taken, coaxing\r\nor forcing food at short intervals through fear lest the child may\r\nlose weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGES IN THE FOOD REQUIRED BY SPECIAL SYMPTOMS OR CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nInfants with weak digestion and those suffering from various forms of\r\nindigestion have often especial trouble in digesting the fat of milk.\r\nTo meet the needs of such there is required a series of formulas in\r\nwhich the fat is lower than in those already given.\r\n\r\nThese formulas are obtained from plain milk.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth Series_\r\n\r\n  _Formulas from Plain Milk (containing 4-per-cent Fat)_\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------\r\n                I.

Sometimes it is due to the\r\nfact that the food is taken too rapidly, from too large a hole in the\r\nnipple. It may be due to too tight clothing, or to moving the child\r\nabout in such a way as to press upon the stomach.\r\n\r\n_What are the principal causes of, and the changes in the food\r\nrequired by habitual vomiting, regurgitation, or spitting up of small\r\nquantities of food between feedings, often repeated many times a day?_\r\n\r\nThis is always a symptom of gastric indigestion, and a most\r\ntroublesome one. In such conditions the fat and often the sugar also\r\nshould be reduced and the lime-water increased.\r\n\r\nFormulas made from rich top-milk or milk and cream are to be avoided.\r\nThose made from 7-per-cent milk are less likely to be the cause of\r\ntrouble than those from 10-per-cent milk; but if the symptoms are at\r\nall severe it is better to use instead of these the formulas of the\r\nFourth Series derived from plain milk.\r\n\r\nReduction in the sugar may be made by adding only one half ounce of\r\nmilk sugar to each twenty ounces of the food; in severe cases the\r\nsugar may be omitted altogether.\r\n\r\nIt is often advisable to double the amount of lime-water--i.e., use\r\ntwo ounces to each twenty ounces of food.\r\n\r\nThe malted foods and all other foods containing much sugar usually\r\naggravate the symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe intervals between meals should generally be half an hour longer,\r\nand sometimes an hour longer, than when digestion is normal.\r\n\r\nThe quantity given at a feeding should generally be less than with a\r\nnormal digestion. Usually a smaller quantity of a strong food succeeds\r\nbetter than a larger quantity of a weak food.\r\n\r\n_What are the causes of, and food changes required by a constant and\r\nexcessive formation of gas in the stomach, leading to distention and\r\npain, or eructations (belching) of gas and often of a sour, watery\r\nfluid?_\r\n\r\nThis is often associated with habitual vomiting, and is due to similar\r\ncauses, but particularly to the sugar, which should be greatly reduced\r\nor omitted entirely.\r\n\r\n_What changes should be made when there is habitual colic?_\r\n\r\nThis is generally due to an accumulation of gas in the intestines\r\nwhich forms there because the proteids (curd) of the milk are not\r\ndigested. They should be reduced by using in the early months a weaker\r\nformula--i.e., instead of Formula V of the First or Second Series, IV\r\nmight be used, or, for a short time, even III. The proteids may be\r\nreduced in the middle period by using weaker formulas If we desire to\r\nreduce the proteids without reducing the fat, we may change from the\r\nSecond to the First Series.\r\n\r\nAnother means of relieving habitual colic is the use of partially\r\npeptonized milk (page 115); still another the dilution with\r\nbarley-water instead of plain water.\r\n\r\n_What change should be made if curds appear in the stools regularly or\r\nfrequently?_\r\n\r\nThis is usually associated with habitual colic, and has to be managed\r\nexactly like that condition, by the means just described.\r\n\r\n_How should the milk be modified for chronic constipation?_\r\n\r\nThe constipation of the first weeks of life has been already referred\r\nto (page 82); it usually disappears as the food is gradually\r\nstrengthened in all its proportions.\r\n\r\nHabitual constipation at a later period is difficult to overcome by\r\ndiet alone. It sometimes depends upon the fact that the proteids are\r\ntoo high, and sometimes that the fat is too low. Hence it is more\r\nfrequent when infants are fed upon plain milk variously diluted (page\r\n90), then when 7-per-cent or 10-per-cent milk is used, and diluted to\r\na greater degree. But it is not desirable to use a top-milk containing\r\nmore than ten per cent fat for this purpose, nor is it wise to carry\r\nthe fat in the food above 4 per cent (i.e., 8 ounces of 10-per-cent\r\nmilk, or 12 ounces of 7-per-cent milk, in a 20-ounce mixture) or other\r\ndisturbances of digestion may be produced.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the use, in place of milk sugar, of ordinary brown\r\nsugar, in half the quantity, is of assistance; or of some of the\r\nmalted foods (Mellin's food, malted milk, cereal milk) also in the\r\nplace of milk sugar.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of the milk of magnesia for the lime-water as\r\nrecommended on page 60 will often be found useful.\r\n\r\nTo infants over nine months old, orange juice may be given.\r\n\r\n_What special modifications are required during very hot weather?_\r\n\r\nDuring the warm season it is well to make the proportion of fat less\r\nthan during cold weather. During short periods of excessive heat it\r\nshould be much less. The fat is reduced by using 7-per-cent milk in\r\nplace of 10-per-cent (i.e., the Second instead of the First Series of\r\nformulas, page 71), or plain milk in place of the 7-per-cent milk in\r\nthe Second and Third Series (page 90). At such times also the usual\r\nfood should be diluted, and water should be given freely between the\r\nfeedings.\r\n\r\n_What changes should be made in the food of a child who, with all the\r\nsigns of good digestion, gains very little or not at all in weight?_\r\n\r\nIf the child seems hungry the quantity of food may be increased; but\r\nif the child will not readily take any more in quantity the strength\r\nmay be increased by the use of the next higher formula. One should,\r\nhowever, be extremely careful under these circumstances not to coax or\r\nforce a child; for this plan is almost certain to cause disturbance of\r\ndigestion and actual loss in weight. A better policy is that of\r\nlooking after the other factors in the child's life,--the care, sleep,\r\nfresh air, etc., for with these rather than with the food the trouble\r\noften lies.\r\n\r\n_What should be done with infants who in spite of all variations in\r\nthe milk continue to have symptoms of indigestion and do not thrive?_\r\n\r\nExcept inmates of institutions who form a class by themselves, most\r\ninfants who receive proper care thrive upon milk if the proportions\r\nsuited to the digestion are given. Still there are some who do not.\r\nThe nutrition of such is always a matter of difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf a wet-nurse is available the employment of one is the thing most\r\nlikely to succeed, particularly if the infant is under four or five\r\nmonths old.\r\n\r\nIf the infant is older, or if a wet-nurse cannot be obtained, some of\r\nthe substitutes for fresh cow's milk may be tried. One of the best is\r\ncondensed milk, Borden's Eagle brand, canned, being preferred. This is\r\nmore likely to agree if the symptoms are chiefly intestinal (colic,\r\nflatulence, curds in the stools, constipation or diarrhoea) than if\r\nthey are chiefly gastric (vomiting, regurgitation, etc.).\r\n\r\n_How should condensed milk be used?_\r\n\r\nFor an infant three or four months old with symptoms of indigestion,\r\nit should at first be diluted with 16 parts of boiled water, or,\r\nsometimes preferably, with barley-water. With improvement in the\r\nsymptoms the dilution may be made 1 to 14, 1 to 12, 1 to 10, and 1 to\r\n8, these changes being gradually made. The intervals between feedings\r\nand the quantities for one feeding are given on page 108.\r\n\r\n_How long should condensed milk be continued?_\r\n\r\nIn most cases it should be used as the sole food for a few weeks only.\r\nAfterward, one feeding a day of a weak formula of modified milk (e.g.,\r\nNo. III or IV of the Second Series, page 71) may be given; later two\r\nfeedings, and thus gradually the number of milk feedings is increased\r\nuntil the child is taking only modified milk.\r\n\r\nCondensed milk is not to be recommended as a permanent food where good\r\nfresh cow's milk can be obtained.\r\n\r\n_What are the objections to its use?_\r\n\r\nIt is very low in fat and proteids, and high in sugar. This accounts\r\nfor its easy digestibility, and also explains why children reared upon\r\nit often gain very rapidly in weight, yet have as a rule but little\r\nresistance. They are very prone to develop rickets and sometimes\r\nscurvy.\r\n\r\n_Are the proprietary infant foods open to the same objections as\r\ncondensed milk?_\r\n\r\nThey are. What has been said of condensed milk applies equally well to\r\nmost of those that are sold in the market as substitutes for milk.\r\n\r\n_What changes in the food are required by slight indisposition?_\r\n\r\nFor slight general disturbances such as dentition, colds, sore\r\nthroats, etc., it is usually sufficient simply to dilute the food. If\r\nthis is but for two or three feedings, it is most easily done by\r\nreplacing with boiled water an ounce or two of the food removed from\r\nthe bottle just before it is given; if for several days, a weaker\r\nformula should be used.\r\n\r\n_What changes should be made for a serious acute illness?_\r\n\r\nFor such attacks as those of pneumonia, bronchitis measles, etc.,\r\nattended with fever, the food should be diluted and the fat reduced as\r\ndescribed on page 95. It should be given at regular intervals, rather\r\nless frequently than in health. Water should be given freely between\r\nthe feedings. Food should not be forced in the early days of an acute\r\nillness, since the loss of appetite usually means an inability to\r\ndigest much food.\r\n\r\n_What immediate changes should be made in the food when the child is\r\ntaken with an acute attack of gastric indigestion with repeated\r\nvomiting, fever, pain, etc.?_\r\n\r\nAll milk should be stopped at once, and only boiled water given for\r\nten or twelve hours; afterward barley-water or whey may be tried, but\r\nno milk for at least twenty-four hours after the vomiting has ceased.\r\nWhen beginning with modified milk the quantity should be small and the\r\nfat low, which may be secured by the use of the Fourth Series of\r\nformulas in the place of the First or Second Series. The proportion of\r\nlime-water may be doubled.\r\n\r\n_What changes should be made for an attack of intestinal indigestion\r\nattended by looseness of the bowels?_\r\n\r\nIf this is not severe (only two or three passages daily) the fat\r\nshould be lowered in the manner stated just above, and the milk should\r\nbe boiled for five minutes. If curds are present in the stools, it may\r\nbe still further diluted.\r\n\r\nIf the diarrhoeal attack is more severe, and attended by fever and\r\nfoul-smelling movements of greater frequency, all milk should be\r\nstopped immediately and the diet mentioned just above under the head\r\nof acute disturbances of the stomach should be employed.\r\n\r\n_What changes in the food should be made when the child seems to have\r\nvery little appetite and yet is not ill?_\r\n\r\nThe number of feedings should be reduced, the interval being\r\nlengthened by one hour or even more. No greater mistake can be made\r\nthan to offer food every hour or two to an infant who is not hungry.\r\nSuch a course only prolongs and aggravates the disturbance.\r\n\r\n_What other conditions besides the food greatly Influence the child's\r\ndigestion?_\r\n\r\nProper clothing, warm feet, regular habits, fresh air, clean bottles,\r\nand food given at the proper temperature are all quite as important as\r\nthe preparation of the food; quiet peaceful surroundings and absence\r\nof excitement are also essential to good digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON MISTAKES IN MILK MODIFICATION AND INFANT FEEDING\r\n\r\nI. In using modifications made from top-milk, much confusion arises\r\nfrom the notion that top-milk is a single definite thing, whereas its\r\ncomposition depends upon a great variety of conditions and, unless all\r\nthese are known, it is impossible to tell how strong it is. Directions\r\nfor the removal of top-milk should be explicitly followed (see page\r\n63), or the results will be very different from those expected.\r\n\r\nII. In formulas calling for a certain number of ounces of top-milk of\r\nany given strength, the mistake is made of removing only the number of\r\nounces needed for the formula. The proper way is to remove the amount\r\nrequired to secure a top-milk of the desired strength and then to take\r\nof this the number of ounces needed in the formula.\r\n\r\nIII. A rich Jersey milk is used as if it were ordinary milk. The\r\nformulas given in this book are chiefly calculated on the basis of a\r\ngood average milk which contains about 4 per cent fat. Many persons\r\nhave the idea that the richer the milk, the more rapidly the child\r\nwill gain in weight, and hence the superiority of such milk for infant\r\nfeeding. While it is true that some children taking a very rich milk\r\nmay, for a time, gain rapidly in weight, yet sooner or later, serious\r\ndisturbances of digestion are nearly always produced.\r\n\r\nIV. The food is increased too rapidly, particularly after some\r\ndisturbance of digestion. If, in an infant three or four months old,\r\nan attack of somewhat acute indigestion occurs, the food should seldom\r\nbe given in full strength before two weeks. The increase in the diet\r\nshould be made very gradually, the steps being made only one half\r\nthose indicated in the series of formulas on pages 70 and 71.\r\nOtherwise it generally happens that the attack of indigestion is very\r\nmuch prolonged and much loss in weight occurs.\r\n\r\nV. When symptoms of indigestion occur, the food is not reduced rapidly\r\nenough. Indigestion usually means that the organs are, for the time,\r\nunequal to the work imposed. If the food is immediately reduced by one\r\nhalf, the organs of digestion soon regain their power and the\r\ndisturbance is short. In every case the amount of reduction should\r\ndepend upon the degree of the disturbance.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF COW'S MILK AT HOME\r\n\r\n_What articles are required for the preparation of cow's milk at\r\nhome?_\r\n\r\nFeeding-bottles, rubber nipples, an eight-ounce graduated measuring\r\nglass, a glass or agate funnel, bottle brush, cotton, alcohol lamp or,\r\nbetter, a Bunsen gas burner, a tall quart cup for warming bottles of\r\nmilk, a pitcher for mixing the food, a wide-mouth bottle for boric\r\nacid and one for bicarbonate of soda, and a pasteurizer. Later, a\r\ndouble boiler for cooking cereals will be needed.\r\n\r\n_What bottles are to be preferred?_\r\n\r\nA cylindrical graduated bottle with a rather wide neck, so as to admit\r\nof easy washing, and one which contains no angles or corners. A single\r\nsize holding eight ounces is quite sufficient for use during the first\r\nyear. All complicated bottles are bad, being difficult to clean. One\r\nshould have as many bottles in use as the child takes meals a day.\r\n\r\n_How should bottles be cared for?_\r\n\r\nAs soon as they are emptied they should be rinsed with cold water and\r\nallowed to stand filled with water to which a little bicarbonate of\r\nsoda has been added. Before the milk is put into them they should be\r\nthoroughly washed with a bottle brush and hot soap-suds and then\r\nplaced for twenty minutes in boiling water.\r\n\r\n_What sort of nipples should be used?_\r\n\r\nOnly simple straight nipples which slip over the neck of the bottle.\r\nThose with a rubber or glass tube are too complicated and very\r\ndifficult to keep clean. Nipples made of black rubber are to be\r\npreferred. The hole in the nipple should not be so large that the milk\r\nwill run in a stream, but just large enough for it to drop rapidly\r\nwhen the bottle with the nipple attached is inverted.\r\n\r\n_How should nipples be cared for?_\r\n\r\nNew nipples should be boiled for five minutes; but it is unnecessary\r\nto repeat this every day as they soon become so soft as to be almost\r\nuseless. After using, nipples should be carefully rinsed in cold water\r\nand kept in a covered glass containing a solution of borax or boric\r\nacid. At least once a day they should be turned wrong side out and\r\nthoroughly washed with soap and water.\r\n\r\n_What sort of cotton should be used?_\r\n\r\nThe refined non-absorbent cotton is rather better for stoppering\r\nbottles, but the ordinary absorbent cotton will answer every purpose.\r\n\r\n_Which is better, the Bunsen burner or the alcohol lamp?_\r\n\r\nIf there is gas in the house, the Bunsen burner is greatly to be\r\npreferred, being cheaper, simpler, and much safer than the alcohol\r\nlamp. If the lamp is used, it should stand upon a table covered with a\r\nplate of zinc or tin, or upon a large tin tray. The French pattern of\r\nalcohol lamp is the best.\r\n\r\n_Give the directions for preparing the food according to any of the\r\nabove formulas._\r\n\r\nThe nurse's hands, bottles, tables, and all utensils should be\r\nscrupulously clean. First dissolve the milk sugar in boiling water,\r\nfiltering if necessary. Then add the milk and cream and lime-water,\r\nmixing the whole in a pitcher. A sufficient quantity of food for\r\ntwenty-four hours is always to be prepared at one time. This is then\r\ndivided into the number of feedings required for the day, each feeding\r\nbeing put in a separate bottle, and the bottle stoppered with cotton.\r\nThe bottles should then be cooled rapidly by standing, first in tepid\r\nthen in cold water, and afterward placed in an ice chest. If the milk\r\nis to be pasteurized or sterilized, this should precede the cooling.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR FEEDING INFANTS\r\n\r\n_How should the bottle be prepared at feeding time?_\r\n\r\nIt should be taken from the ice chest, and warmed by standing in warm\r\nwater which is deep enough to cover the milk in the bottle; it should\r\nthen be thoroughly shaken and the nipple adjusted; the nurse should\r\nsee that the hole in the nipple is not too large nor too small.\r\n\r\n_How may the temperature of the milk be tested?_\r\n\r\nNever by putting the nipple in the nurse's mouth. Before adjusting the\r\nnipple, a teaspoonful may be poured from the bottle and tasted, or a\r\nfew drops may be poured through the nipple upon the inner surface of\r\nthe wrist, where it should feel quite warm but never hot; or a\r\nthermometer may be placed in the water in which the bottle stands. A\r\ndairy thermometer should be used, and the temperature of the water\r\nshould be between 98° and 105° F.\r\n\r\n_What is a simple contrivance for keeping the milk warm during\r\nfeeding?_\r\n\r\nA small flannel bag with a draw string may be slipped over the bottle.\r\n\r\n_In what position should an infant take its bottle?_\r\n\r\nFor the first two or three months it is better, except at night, when\r\nit may be undesirable to take the infant from its crib, that it be\r\nheld on the nurse's arm during the feeding; later it may lie on its\r\nside in the crib provided the bottle is held by the nurse until it has\r\nbeen emptied; otherwise a young infant readily falls into the bad\r\nhabit of alternately sucking and sleeping, and often will be an hour\r\nor more over its bottle.\r\n\r\n_How much time should be allowed for one feeding?_\r\n\r\nNever more than twenty minutes. The bottle should then be taken away\r\nand not given until the next feeding time. Under no circumstances\r\nshould an infant form the habit of sleeping with the nipple in its\r\nmouth. A sleepy infant should be kept awake by gentle shaking until\r\nthe food is taken, or the bottle should be removed altogether.\r\n\r\n_Should an infant be played with soon after feeding?_\r\n\r\nOn no account; such a thing frequently causes vomiting and sometimes\r\nindigestion. After every feeding the infant should be allowed to lie\r\nquietly in its crib, and disturbed as little as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERVALS OF FEEDING\r\n\r\n_How often should a baby be fed during the first month?_\r\n\r\nEvery two hours during the day and twice during the night, or ten\r\nfeedings during the twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n_At what age may the interval be made two and a half hours?_\r\n\r\nUsually at five or six weeks.\r\n\r\n_When may it be increased to three hours?_\r\n\r\nUsually at two months.\r\n\r\n_Why should not a child be fed more frequently?_\r\n\r\nIt takes the stomach nearly two hours to digest a meal at two months,\r\nand about two and a half hours at five or six months, and if the meals\r\nare too near together the second one is given before the first has\r\nbeen digested and vomiting and indigestion result. The meals should be\r\nfar enough apart to give the stomach a little time for rest just\r\nbefore each feeding.\r\n\r\n_Schedule for Feeding Healthy Infants during the First Year_\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n       AGE.

The larger quantities are those required by large\r\nchildren with strong digestion; in very few cases will it be advisable\r\nto go above these figures.\r\n\r\nThe interval is reckoned from the beginning of one feeding to the\r\nbeginning of the next one.\r\n\r\n_When should the interval between the feedings be lengthened?_\r\n\r\nWhen there is gastric indigestion as shown by habitual vomiting or the\r\nregurgitation of food long after the bottle is finished; also when the\r\nappetite is very poor so that the infant regularly leaves some of its\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n_When should the interval between the feedings be shortened?_\r\n\r\nThis is done much too frequently; it is rarely advisable to feed any\r\ninfant, except one seriously ill, oftener than the time put down in\r\nthe schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULARITY IN FEEDING\r\n\r\n_How can a baby be taught to be regular in its habits of eating and\r\nsleeping?_\r\n\r\nBy always feeding at regular intervals and putting to sleep at exactly\r\nthe same time every day and evening.\r\n\r\n_When should regular training be begun?_\r\n\r\nDuring the first week of life.\r\n\r\n_Should a baby be wakened to be nursed or fed if sleeping quietly?_\r\n\r\nYes, for a few days. This will not be required long, for with regular\r\nfeeding an infant soon wakes regularly for its meal, almost upon the\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n_Should regularity in feeding be kept up at night as well as during\r\nthe day?_\r\n\r\nOnly up to nine or ten o'clock; after that time a baby should be\r\nallowed to sleep as long as it will.\r\n\r\n_At what age may a well baby go without food from 10 P.M. to 6 or 7\r\nA.M.?_\r\n\r\nUsually at four months, and always at five or six months. Night\r\nfeeding is one of the most frequent causes of wakefulness and\r\ndisturbed sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERILIZED MILK\r\n\r\n_What is meant by sterilizing milk?_\r\n\r\nHeating milk for the purpose of destroying germs.\r\n\r\n_Does all cows milk contain germs?_\r\n\r\nYes; even when handled most carefully, milk contains many germs; but\r\nwhen carelessly handled, and in summer, the number is enormous. While\r\nmost of these are harmless or cause only the souring of milk, others\r\nare occasionally present which may produce serious diseases such as\r\ntyphoid fever, diphtheria scarlet fever, cholera, tuberculosis, and\r\nmany forms of diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n_Under what circumstances is it necessary to sterilize milk?_\r\n\r\n1. In warm weather when it cannot be obtained fresh; hence always in\r\ncities and towns during the summer.\r\n\r\n2. When one cannot be certain that the cows are healthy, or that the\r\nmilk has been carefully handled.\r\n\r\n3. When the milk is to be kept for any considerable time (i.e., over\r\ntwenty-four hours), especially if no ice can be had.\r\n\r\n4. During epidemics of typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, or\r\nany form of diarrhoeal disease.\r\n\r\n_What are the two methods of heating milk?_\r\n\r\nThe first is known as _sterilizing_, in which the milk is heated to\r\n212° F. for one hour or one hour and a half; the second is known as\r\n_pasteurizing_, in which the milk is heated to 155° or 170° F. for\r\nthirty minutes. A temperature of 155° F. continued for thirty minutes\r\nis sufficient to kill the germs of the diseases above referred to.\r\n\r\n_Will milk which has been thus treated keep indefinitely?_\r\n\r\nNo; for although all the living germs may be killed, there are many\r\nundeveloped germs, or spores, which are not destroyed, and which soon\r\ngrow into living germs. Milk heated to 212° F. for an hour will keep\r\nupon ice for two or three weeks; that heated to 155° F. for two or\r\nthree days.\r\n\r\n_Is milk which has been sterilized always a safe food?_\r\n\r\nNo; for the reason that the milk may be so old, so dirty, and so\r\ncontaminated before sterilizing that it may be still unfit for food,\r\nthough it contains no living germs.\r\n\r\n_Is cow's milk rendered more digestible by being heated in this way?_\r\n\r\nSterilizing milk does not improve its digestibility but rather the\r\ncontrary. Sterilized milk should be modified for infant feeding in the\r\nsame way as milk which has not been heated.\r\n\r\n_Is milk in any way injured by heating to 212° F. for an hour?_\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that milk is rendered less digestible by\r\nsuch heating; also that it is more constipating, and that for some\r\nchildren its nutritive properties are interfered with, so that it may\r\ncause scurvy; this, however, is not seen unless it is continued as the\r\nsole food for a long period. These objections are of so much\r\nimportance that this plan of heating milk is not to be recommended for\r\ngeneral use.\r\n\r\n_When is it advantageous to heat milk to 212° F.?_\r\n\r\nFor use upon long journeys, such as crossing the ocean. Milk should\r\nthen be heated for one hour upon two successive days, without removing\r\nthe cotton stoppers from the bottles.\r\n\r\n_Is milk in any way injured by heating to 155° F. for thirty minutes?_\r\n\r\nThis point is not yet definitely settled. Such heating does not affect\r\nthe taste of milk and does not render it more constipating. The\r\nunfavourable effects; if there are any, are so slight that they need\r\nnot deter one from the use of pasteurized milk, even for long periods.\r\nThe preference, however, should always be given to milk which is so\r\nclean and so fresh as not to require any heating.\r\n\r\n_How should milk be pasteurized?_\r\n\r\nA convenient form of apparatus is that known as Freeman's\r\npasteurizer[5]; another is the Walker-Gordon pasteurizer.[6]\r\n\r\n    [5] This can be obtained at 411 West Fifty-ninth Street, New\r\n    York, with bottles and full directions; a tin one, at a cost of\r\n    $3.50, and a copper one, which is much more durable, for $7.00.\r\n\r\n    [6] Obtained at the same prices from any of the Walker-Gordon\r\n    milk laboratories.\r\n\r\n_How should milk be cooled after pasteurizing?_\r\n\r\nAlways by placing the bottles in cold water, so as to cool them\r\nrapidly; never by letting them stand at the temperature of the room,\r\nor by placing them, when warm, in an ice box.\r\n\r\n_Why is this precaution necessary?_\r\n\r\nCooling in the air or in an ice box requires from two to four hours,\r\nand during that time a great many of the undeveloped germs may mature\r\nand greatly injure the keeping properties of the milk. In the cold\r\nwater, milk can be cooled in from ten to twenty minutes if the water\r\nis frequently changed, or if ice is added to the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODIFIED MILK OF THE MILK LABORATORIES\r\n\r\n_What is \"modified milk\" of the milk laboratories?_\r\n\r\nIt is milk containing definite proportions of the fat, sugar,\r\nproteids, etc., put up usually according to the prescription of a\r\nphysician, who indicates how much of the different elements he\r\ndesires. The most reliable are the laboratories of the Walker-Gordon\r\nCompany, which has branches in many of the large cities of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent method of having milk prepared since it can be\r\ndone with greater care and cleanliness than are possible in most\r\nhomes. It is besides a great convenience if circumstances make it\r\nimpossible to prepare the milk properly at home.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory should be used for infant feeding only by one who is\r\nsomewhat familiar with this method of ordering milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEPTONIZED MILK\r\n\r\n_What is peptonized milk?_\r\n\r\nMilk in which the proteids (curd) have been partially digested.\r\n\r\n_How is this accomplished?_\r\n\r\nBy the action of a peptonizing powder which is composed of a digestive\r\nagent known as the extractum pancreatis and bicarbonate of soda, which\r\nis added to the plain or diluted milk. This is sold in tubes or in\r\ntablets, and it is the active ingredient of the peptogenic milk\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n_Describe the process._\r\n\r\nThe plain or modified milk is placed in a clean glass jar or bottle,\r\nand the peptonizing powder, which is first rubbed up with a\r\ntablespoonful of the milk, is added and the bottle shaken. The bottle\r\nis then placed in a large pitcher or basin containing water kept at\r\nthe temperature of about 110° F., or as warm as the hand can bear\r\ncomfortably, and left for ten to twenty minutes if the milk is to be\r\npartially peptonized; for two hours if it is to be completely\r\npeptonized.\r\n\r\n_What taste has partially peptonized milk?_\r\n\r\nNone, if peptonizing is continued for only ten minutes, but at the end\r\nof twenty minutes it begins to be bitter, when the process of\r\ndigestion has gone further.\r\n\r\n_How is the bitter taste avoided in partially peptonized milk?_\r\n\r\nAt the end of ten or fifteen minutes the milk may be placed in a\r\nsaucepan and quickly raised to boiling point; this kills the ferment,\r\nso that the milk will not become bitter when warmed a second time. Or,\r\nthe milk may be rapidly cooled by placing the bottles first in cool\r\nand then in ice water; in this way the ferment is not destroyed, and\r\nthe milk may become bitter when warmed for feeding.\r\n\r\n_Should the whole day's supply be peptonized at once, or each bottle\r\nseparately just before the feeding?_\r\n\r\nEither plan may be followed. If the former, it is better to raise the\r\nmilk to boiling point after peptonizing; if the latter, it should not\r\nbe peptonized more than ten minutes, for it will continue to peptonize\r\nwhile it is being taken by the child.\r\n\r\n_Is not the bitter taste of completely peptonized milk a great\r\nobstacle to its use?_\r\n\r\nNot in the case of young infants; one under four or five months old\r\nwill usually take it without any objection after two or three\r\nfeedings; but it cannot often be used for those who are much older.\r\n\r\n_How much of the peptonizing powder should be used?_\r\n\r\nThere are required for one pint of plain milk, five grains of the\r\nextractum pancreatis and fifteen grains of bicarbonate of soda. This\r\nquantity is usually put up in a single tube or tablet. In the formulas\r\npreviously given, less than this will be required; for the weaker\r\nformulas, one half or one third of the powder mentioned will be\r\nsufficient for one pint of food. For a single feeding of four ounces,\r\none may use one eighth of a tube with a weak formula, or one sixth of\r\na tube with a stronger formula.\r\n\r\n_What are the advantages of peptonized milk?_\r\n\r\nPartially peptonized milk is useful for young infants who have great\r\ndifficulty in digesting the curd of milk, sometimes even when diluted\r\nas already described; completely peptonized milk, during acute attacks\r\nof indigestion.\r\n\r\n_For how long a period may the use of peptonized milk be continued?_\r\n\r\nCompletely peptonized milk may be used for a few days, or at most a\r\nfew weeks; partially peptonized milk may be used for two or three\r\nmonths, but not indefinitely; it should be left off gradually by\r\nshortening the time of peptonizing, and lessening the amount of the\r\npowder used.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING DURING THE SECOND YEAR\r\n\r\n_How many meals are required during the second year?_\r\n\r\nIt is usually better to continue five meals throughout the second\r\nyear. Some children will sleep from 6 P.M. to 6 A.M. without waking,\r\nbut unless there is a feeding at 10 P.M. children are apt to wake very\r\nearly in the morning.\r\n\r\n_Should each feeding be prepared at the time it is given, or all\r\nfeedings at one time, as during the first year?_\r\n\r\nDuring the second and third years it is better to prepare the milk for\r\nthe entire day at one time. If it is to be modified by adding cream,\r\nwater, etc., it is done as during the first year.\r\n\r\nLater, when only plain milk is used, the quantities needed for the\r\ndifferent feedings should be put into one or into two bottles, which\r\nthen may be pasteurized or not as may be necessary. In this way the\r\ndifferent feedings are kept separate, and the day's supply of milk is\r\nnot disturbed every time the child is fed, as otherwise is\r\nunavoidable. The food should be prepared as soon as possible after the\r\ndaily milk supply is delivered in the morning.\r\n\r\n_Give a proper diet for an average healthy child of twelve months._\r\n\r\n6.30 A.M.  Milk, six to seven ounces; diluted with barley or oat\r\n               gruel, two to three ounces; after the thirteenth\r\n               month, taken from a cup.\r\n\r\n   9 A.M.  Orange juice, one to two ounces.\r\n\r\n  10 A.M.  Milk, two parts; oatmeal or barley gruel, one part;\r\n               from ten to twelve ounces in all may be allowed;\r\n               it should be given from a cup.\r\n\r\n   2 P.M.  Beef juice, one to two ounces;\r\n             or, the white of one egg, slightly cooked; later, the\r\n               entire egg;\r\n             or, mutton or chicken broth, four to six ounces.\r\n           Milk and gruel in proportions above given, four to\r\n               six ounces.\r\n\r\n   6 P.M.  Same as at 10 A.M.\r\n\r\n  10 P.M.  Same as at 6.30 A.M., except that the milk may be\r\n               given from the bottle.\r\n\r\n_How long may this schedule be followed?_\r\n\r\nUsually until the fourteenth or fifteenth month. After this time the\r\ncereals may be given much thicker and fed from a spoon.\r\n\r\n_May any other fruit juices be given at this period?_\r\n\r\nOrange juice is the best; next to this the juice of fresh ripe\r\npeaches, red raspberries or strawberries. All these should be strained\r\nvery carefully through muslin to make sure that the child gets none of\r\nthe pulp or seeds, either of which may cause serious disturbance. Of\r\nthe orange or peach juice, from one to four tablespoonfuls may be\r\nallowed at one time; of the others about half the quantity. The fruit\r\njuice is best given one hour before the second feeding.\r\n\r\n_When should a child be weaned from its bottle?_\r\n\r\nMost children can and should be taught to take their food from the cup\r\nor spoon by the time they are thirteen months old; but it is\r\nconvenient to give the 10 P.M. feeding from the bottle during the\r\ngreater part of the second year (see page 52).\r\n\r\n_Give a proper diet for an average child from the fourteenth to the\r\neighteenth month._\r\n\r\nThe bottle should not be given except at night. Cereals may now form\r\nan important part of the diet. They should be very thoroughly cooked,\r\nusually for three hours, and strained.\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule should be about as follows:\r\n\r\n6.30 A.M.  Milk, warmed, eight to ten ounces, given from a cup.\r\n\r\n   9 A.M.  Fruit juice, one to three ounces.\r\n\r\n  10 A.M.  Cereal: one, later two or three, tablespoonfuls of oatmeal\r\n               hominy or wheaten grits, cooked for at\r\n               least three hours; upon this from one to two\r\n               ounces of thin cream, or milk and cream, with\r\n               plenty of salt, but without sugar.\r\n           Crisp dry toast, one piece;\r\n             or, unsweetened zwieback;\r\n             or, one Huntley and Palmer breakfast biscuit.\r\n           Milk, warmed, six to eight ounces, from a cup.\r\n\r\n   2 P.M.  Beef juice, one to two ounces; and one egg (soft\r\n               boiled, poached or coddled); and boiled rice, one\r\n               tablespoonful;\r\n             or, broth (mutton or chicken), four ounces; one or\r\n               two Huntley and Palmer breakfast biscuits, or\r\n               zwieback; and (if most of the teeth are present)\r\n               rare scraped meat, at first one teaspoonful, gradually\r\n               increasing to one tablespoonful.\r\n\r\n   6 P.M.  Cereal: two tablespoonfuls of farina, cream of wheat,\r\n             or arrowroot, cooked for at least one half hour,\r\n               with milk, plenty of salt, but without sugar.\r\n           Milk, warmed, eight to ten ounces, given from a cup.\r\n\r\n  10 P.M.  Milk, warmed, eight to ten ounces, which may be\r\n               given from a bottle.\r\n\r\n_Give a proper diet for an average child from the eighteenth month to\r\nthe end of the second year._\r\n\r\nThe same order of meals as for the months just preceding should be\r\nfollowed. For most children milk at 10 P.M. is desirable. There are\r\nmany, however who sleep regularly from 6 P.M. until 6 A.M. without\r\nfood; for such the night feeding should, of course, not be insisted\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nThe daily schedule should be about as follows:\r\n\r\n6.30 A.M.  Milk, warmed, ten to twelve ounces, given from cup.\r\n\r\n   9 A.M.  Fruit juice, two to three ounces.\r\n\r\n  10 A.M.  Cereals: similar to those given from the fourteenth\r\n               to the eighteenth month; they need not be\r\n               strained although they should be cooked and\r\n               served in the same way.\r\n           Crisp dry bread, zwieback, or Huntley and Palmer\r\n               biscuits, without butter.\r\n           Milk, warmed, one cup.\r\n\r\n   2 P.M.  Beef juice and one egg;\r\n             or, broth and meat; care being taken that the\r\n               meat is always rare and scraped or very finely\r\n               divided; beefsteak, mutton chop, or roast beef\r\n               may be given.\r\n           Very stale bread, or two pieces of zwieback.\r\n           Prune pulp or baked apple, one to two tablespoonfuls.\r\n           Water; no milk.\r\n\r\n   6 P.M.  Cereal: farina, cream of wheat, or arrowroot, cooked\r\n               for at least one half hour, with milk, plenty of\r\n               salt, but without sugar.\r\n             or, milk toast or stale bread and milk.\r\n\r\n  10 P.M.  If required, ten to twelve ounces of plain milk.\r\n\r\n_What fruits may be given at this period?_\r\n\r\nIf the child has a feeble digestion, only the fruit juices previously\r\nallowed; strong children may have in addition prune pulp, baked apple,\r\nand applesauce. The prune pulp is prepared by stewing the dried prunes\r\nwithout sugar until they are very soft, and removing all the skin by\r\nputting the fruit through a strainer; of this from one to two\r\ntablespoonfuls may be given at one time. The baked apple should be\r\ngiven without cream, and the applesauce should have very little sugar.\r\n\r\n_How and when should water be given?_\r\n\r\nThroughout the second year water should be given freely between the\r\nfeedings, especially in warm weather; from one to three ounces may be\r\ngiven at one time, either from a spoon, a glass, or a bottle. The\r\nwater should be boiled daily and then cooled. It should not be allowed\r\nto stand in the room, but fresh water should be put into the bottle\r\neach time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING DURING THE THIRD YEAR\r\n\r\n_What changes may be made in the diet during the third year?_\r\n\r\nThe night feeding at 10 P.M. should be omitted. A greater quantity of\r\nsolid food may be allowed, particularly at the mid-day meal. It is not\r\nadvisable to begin potato and other vegetables until this age is\r\nreached. Three regular meals should be given and milk once besides,\r\neither between the breakfast and dinner or dinner and supper,\r\nwhichever is the longer interval. Water should be allowed freely\r\nbetween meals.\r\n\r\n_What would be a proper schedule for an average child during the third\r\nyear?_\r\n\r\n7.30 A.M.  Cereal: cooked (preferably over night) for three\r\n               hours, although a somewhat larger variety may\r\n               be given than during the second year; given as\r\n               before with milk or thin cream, salt, but very\r\n               little sugar.\r\n           Warm milk, one glass.\r\n           A soft egg, poached, boiled or coddled.\r\n           Bread, very stale or dry, one slice, with butter.\r\n\r\n  10 A.M.  Warm milk, one cup, with a cracker or piece of very\r\n               stale bread and butter.\r\n\r\n   2 P.M.  Soup, four ounces;\r\n             or, beef juice, two ounces.\r\n           Meat: chop, steak, roast beef or lamb or chicken.\r\n           A baked white potato;\r\n             or, boiled rice.\r\n           Green vegetable: asparagus tips, string beans, peas,\r\n               spinach; all to be cooked until very soft, and\r\n               mashed, or preferably put through a sieve; at\r\n               first, one or two teaspoonfuls.\r\n           Dessert: cooked fruit--baked or stewed apple, stewed\r\n               prunes.\r\n           Water; no milk.\r\n\r\n   6 P.M.  Cereal: farina, cream of wheat, or arrowroot, cooked\r\n               for at least one half hour, with plenty of salt,\r\n               but without sugar;\r\n             or, milk toast;\r\n             or, bread and milk;\r\n             or, stale or dry bread and butter and a glass of milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTHE DIET OF OLDER CHILDREN (FOURTH TO TENTH YEAR)\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout this period the largest meal should always be in the middle\r\nof the day, and a light supper given, very much like that described\r\nfor the third year. During the first half of this period, milk may be\r\nallowed once either between breakfast and dinner or dinner and supper;\r\nno other eating between meals should be permitted, but water should be\r\nallowed freely.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILK AND CREAM\r\n\r\n_What part of the diet should milk form during childhood?_\r\n\r\nIt should form a very important part up to the tenth year; nothing can\r\ntake its place. There are comparatively few children who cannot take\r\nand digest milk if it is properly fed.\r\n\r\n_Why is milk so advantageous?_\r\n\r\nBecause no food that we possess has so high a nutritive value as milk,\r\nfor the amount of work required of the organs of digestion. It is,\r\ntherefore, peculiarly adapted to the diet of the child.\r\n\r\n_What are the essential points in the use of milk?_\r\n\r\nIt should be clean and fresh, but not too rich. It is a mistake to\r\nselect for any children the rich milk of a Jersey herd and use it as\r\nthough it were an ordinary milk. For children who have difficulty in\r\ndigesting milk, it should be somewhat diluted, i.e., one part of water\r\nto four parts of milk, or salt or bicarbonate of soda should be added.\r\nIt is also important not to give milk at meals when fruits, especially\r\nsour fruits, are allowed.\r\n\r\n_How much milk may advantageously be given?_\r\n\r\nThe average child with good digestion should take from one and one\r\nhalf pints to one quart of milk daily, this including not only what\r\nthe child drinks but what is served upon cereals and in other ways. It\r\nis seldom wise to allow a child to take as much as two quarts daily,\r\nas a more mixed diet for most children is better.\r\n\r\n_To what extent may cream be used?_\r\n\r\nOlder children do not require so large a proportion of fat in their\r\nfood as do infants, and the use of cream, especially very rich cream,\r\noften results in disturbances of digestion. The use of too much or too\r\nrich cream is a common cause of the coated tongue, foul breath and\r\npale gray stools, often called \"biliousness.\"\r\n\r\n_Is not cream useful in overcoming the constipation of children?_\r\n\r\nWith infants it is valuable to a certain point, but with older\r\nchildren only to a limited degree, and if such symptoms as those above\r\ndescribed are present, cream should not be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS\r\n\r\n_To what extent may eggs be used in the diet of this period?_\r\n\r\nThey form a most valuable food. It is essential that they should be\r\nfresh and only slightly cooked, soft boiled, poached or coddled; fried\r\neggs should never be given and all omelets are objectionable.\r\n\r\n_Which is more digestible, the white or yolk of the egg?_\r\n\r\nFor the great majority of children, the white of the egg. This forms\r\none of the most digestible proteids we possess, and can be used, even\r\nin the latter part of the first year, with advantage.\r\n\r\n_Is it not true that eggs often cause \"biliousness\"?_\r\n\r\nVery seldom, if fed as above advised. This is an old prejudice but has\r\nlittle basis in fact.\r\n\r\n_How often may eggs be given?_\r\n\r\nMost children from four to ten years old will take one egg for\r\nbreakfast and another for supper for an indefinite period with relish\r\nand benefit. There are, however, some few who have a peculiar\r\nidiosyncrasy as regards eggs and cannot take them at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAT AND FISH\r\n\r\n_What meats may be given to young children?_\r\n\r\nThe best are beefsteak, mutton-chop, roast beef, roast lamb, broiled\r\nchicken and certain delicate fish, such as shad or bass.\r\n\r\n_What are the important points to be considered in giving meat to\r\nchildren?_\r\n\r\nMost meats should be rare and either scraped or very finely divided,\r\nas no child can be trusted to chew meat properly. Meats are best\r\nbroiled or roasted, but should not be fried.\r\n\r\n_How often should meat be given?_\r\n\r\nAt this period, only once a day, at the mid-day meal.\r\n\r\n_Is not the excessive nervousness of many modern children due to the\r\ngiving of meat, or at least aggravated by its use?_\r\n\r\nThere is little ground for such a belief, unless an excessive amount\r\nof meat is given. Certainly cutting off meat from the diet of nervous\r\nchildren seldom produces any striking benefit.\r\n\r\n_What meats should be forbidden to young children?_\r\n\r\nHam, bacon, sausage, pork, liver, kidney, game and all dried and\r\nsalted meats, also cod, mackerel and halibut; all of these are best\r\nwithheld until the child has passed the tenth year.\r\n\r\n_Are not gravies beneficial and nutritious?_\r\n\r\nThe beef juice, or so-called \"platter gravy,\" from a roast is\r\nexceedingly nutritious and desirable, but many of the thickened\r\ngravies are much less digestible and are too often given in excess;\r\nonly a small quantity should be allowed. They should not form an\r\nimportant part of the meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLES\r\n\r\n_What vegetables may be used at this period?_\r\n\r\nWhite potatoes may be given first. These should preferably be baked or\r\nboiled and mashed, but never fried. They should be served with beef\r\njuice or with cream rather than with butter.\r\n\r\nOf the green vegetables, the best are peas, spinach, asparagus tips,\r\nstring beans, stewed celery, young beets, or carrots, and squash.\r\nBaked sweet potato, turnips, boiled onions and cauliflower, all well\r\ncooked, may be given after the sixth or seventh year in moderate\r\namount.\r\n\r\nThe principal trouble in the digestion of vegetables is due to\r\nimperfect cooking. It is, in fact, almost impossible to cook them too\r\nmuch; they should also be very finely mashed. They form a valuable\r\naddition to the diet after three years, although the amount at first\r\ngiven should be small, one or two teaspoonfuls. They greatly aid in\r\nsecuring regularity of the bowels. Because small particles are seen in\r\nthe stools, it is not to be inferred that they are causing disturbance\r\nand should, therefore, be stopped, but only that they should be more\r\nthoroughly cooked and more finely divided before being given.\r\n\r\n_Is it safe to use canned vegetables for children?_\r\n\r\nMany of the best brands of canned vegetables are quite safe and some,\r\nsuch as peas and asparagus, can be used with advantage. They are\r\nfrequently better than stale green vegetables often sold in the\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n_What vegetables should not be given to young children?_\r\n\r\nNone of those which are eaten raw, such as celery, radishes, onions,\r\ncucumbers, tomatoes or lettuce. Certain others, even when well cooked,\r\nshould not be allowed; as corn, lima beans, cabbage, egg plant. None\r\nof these should be given until a child has passed the age of ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n_Are vegetable salads to be given?_\r\n\r\nAs a rule salads of all kinds should be omitted until a child has\r\npassed the tenth year. Salads are difficult to digest and a cause of\r\nmuch disturbance in children of all ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREALS\r\n\r\n_What are the most important points in selecting and preparing\r\ncereals?_\r\n\r\nThe important things are that they are properly cooked and not used in\r\nexcess. The ready-to-serve cereals should never be chosen for\r\nchildren, nor should a child, because he is fond of cereals, be\r\nallowed to make his entire meal of them, taking two or three\r\nsaucerfuls at a feeding.\r\n\r\nMany of the partially cooked preparations of oatmeal and wheat are\r\nexcellent, but should be cooked for a much longer time than is stated\r\nupon the package, usually three or four times as long. Digestibility\r\nis chiefly a matter of proper cooking. Most of the grains,--oatmeal,\r\nhominy, rice, wheaten grits,--require at least three hours' cooking in\r\na double boiler in order to be easily digested. The prepared\r\nflours,--corn starch, arrowroot, barley,--should be cooked at least\r\ntwenty minutes. I know of no preparation in the modern market which\r\nrequires no cooking, which is to be recommended for children.\r\n\r\n_How are cereals to be given?_\r\n\r\nUsually with milk or a mixture of milk and cream; always with an\r\nabundance of salt and with very little or no sugar, one half\r\nteaspoonful on a saucerful of cereal should be the limit.\r\n\r\nCereals should not be served with syrups or butter and sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROTHS AND SOUPS\r\n\r\n_What broths and soups are to be recommended?_\r\n\r\nMeat broths are generally to be preferred to vegetable broths,--mutton\r\nor chicken being usually most liked by children. Nearly all plain\r\nbroths may be given. Those thickened with rice, barley or corn starch\r\nform a useful variety, especially with the addition of milk.\r\n\r\nVegetable purees of peas, spinach, celery or asparagus may be used for\r\nchildren over seven years old. Tomato soup should not be given to\r\nyoung children.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD, CRACKERS AND CAKES\r\n\r\n_What forms of breadstuffs are best suited to young children?_\r\n\r\nFresh bread should not be given, but stale bread cut thin and freshly\r\ndried in the oven until it is crisp is very useful, also zwieback, the\r\nunsweetened being preferred. Oatmeal, graham or gluten crackers and\r\nthe Huntley and Palmer breakfast biscuits, stale rolls, or corn bread\r\nwhich has been split and toasted or dried till crisp, form a\r\nsufficient variety for most children.\r\n\r\n_What breadstuffs should be forbidden?_\r\n\r\nAll hot breads, all fresh rolls, all buckwheat and other griddle\r\ncakes, all fresh sweet cakes, especially those covered with icing and\r\nthose containing dried fruits. A stale lady-finger or piece of sponge\r\ncake is about as far in the matter of cakes as it is wise to go with\r\nchildren up to seven or eight years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESSERTS\r\n\r\n_What desserts may be given to young children?_\r\n\r\nMistakes are more often made here than in any other part of the\r\nchild's diet. Up to six or seven years, only junket, plain rice\r\npudding without raisins, plain custard and, not more than once a week,\r\na small amount of ice cream.\r\n\r\n_What should be especially forbidden?_\r\n\r\nAll pies, tarts and pastry of every description, jam, syrups and\r\npreserved fruits; nuts, candy and dried fruits.\r\n\r\n_Does \"a little\" do any harm?_\r\n\r\nYes, in that it develops a taste for this sort of food, after which\r\nplainer food is taken with less relish. Besides the \"little\" is very\r\napt soon to become a good deal.\r\n\r\n_Does not the child's instinctive craving for sweets indicate his need\r\nof them?_\r\n\r\nThat a child likes or craves sweets is the usual excuse of an\r\nindulgent parent. Every child likes his own way, but that is no reason\r\nwhy he should not be trained to obedience and self-control; a child's\r\nfondness for sweets can hardly be considered a normal instinct. As a\r\nmatter of fact, supported by everyday experience, no causes are\r\nproductive of more disorders of digestion than the free indulgence in\r\ndesserts and sweets by young children. It is a constantly increasing\r\ntendency, not easily controlled as a child grows older; and in early\r\nchildhood, the only safe rule is to give none at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITS\r\n\r\n_Are fruits an essential or important part of the diet?_\r\n\r\nThey are a very important part and should be begun in infancy. They\r\nare particularly useful for the effect they have upon the bowels. It\r\nis important that they should be selected with care and given with\r\nmuch discretion, especially in cities. In the country where fruit is\r\nabsolutely fresh, a somewhat greater latitude may be allowed than is\r\ngiven below.\r\n\r\n_What fruits may safely be given to children up to five years old?_\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, only cooked fruits and the juices of fresh fruits.\r\n\r\n_What fruit juices may be used?_\r\n\r\nThat from sweet oranges is the best, but the fresh juice of grape\r\nfruit, peaches, strawberries and raspberries may also be used.\r\n\r\n_What stewed fruits may be given?_\r\n\r\nStewed or baked apples, prunes, pears, peaches and apricots.\r\n\r\n_What raw fruits are to be particularly avoided with young children?_\r\n\r\nThe pulp of oranges or grape fruit, also cherries, berries, bananas\r\nand pineapple.\r\n\r\n_What precautions should be emphasized regarding the use of fruits?_\r\n\r\nThat they should be used with greater care in hot weather and with\r\nchildren who are prone to attacks of intestinal indigestion.\r\n\r\n_What symptoms indicate that fruits should be avoided?_\r\n\r\nA tendency to looseness of the bowels with the discharge of mucus, or\r\nfrequent attacks of abdominal pain or stomach ache.\r\n\r\n_Is there any special choice of meals at which fruit should be given?_\r\n\r\nThe fruit juice given early in the morning, upon an empty stomach,\r\nworks more actively upon the bowels than if it is given later in the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt is not, as a rule, wise to give cream or milk with sour fruits.\r\nUsually the fruit is best given at the mid-day meal, as a dessert, at\r\na time when no milk is taken. It is in all cases important that the\r\nquantity of fruit should be moderate.\r\n\r\n_What besides water and milk should a child be allowed to drink and\r\nwhat should be forbidden?_\r\n\r\nTea, coffee, wine, beer and cider in all quantities and in all forms\r\nshould be forbidden to young children below puberty. Cocoa which is\r\nmade very weak, i.e., almost all milk, is often useful as a hot drink.\r\nLemonade, soda-water, etc., should if possible be deferred until the\r\ntenth year. A free indulgence in things of this kind should never be\r\npermitted with children of seven or eight years.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION IN OLDER CHILDREN\r\n\r\n_What are the different ways in which indigestion shows itself in\r\nchildren?_\r\n\r\nFirst, in acute disturbances which last for a few days only; and,\r\nsecondly, in chronic disturbances which may continue for weeks or\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n_Which of the two forms of indigestion is more likely to impair\r\nseriously the health of the child?_\r\n\r\nChronic indigestion; for since the cause is not recognized it often\r\ngoes on for months and even years unchecked.\r\n\r\n_What are the symptoms of acute indigestion?_\r\n\r\nThese are familiar and easily recognized. They are vomiting, pain,\r\nundigested movements from the bowels, often fever and considerable\r\nprostration.\r\n\r\nSuch attacks are usually traceable to their proper cause, the removal\r\nof which is followed by prompt recovery.\r\n\r\n_What are the common causes of acute indigestion?_\r\n\r\nThis is frequently due to overeating, to indulgence in some special\r\narticle of improper food, or to eating heartily when overtired. Acute\r\nindigestion often marks the beginning of some acute general illness.\r\n\r\n_How should acute indigestion be managed?_\r\n\r\nOne should bear in mind that for the time being the digestive organs\r\nhave stopped work altogether. The important thing, therefore, is to\r\nclear out from the intestines all undigested food by some active\r\ncathartic, such as castor oil. The stomach has usually emptied itself\r\nby vomiting. All food should be stopped for from twelve to thirty-six\r\nhours, according to the severity of the attack, only water being\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n_At the end of this time is it safe to begin with the former diet?_\r\n\r\nNo; for such a procedure is almost certain to cause another attack of\r\nindigestion. At first only broth, thin gruel, very greatly diluted\r\nmilk, or whey should be given. The diet may be very slowly but\r\ngradually increased as the child's appetite and digestion improve, but\r\nin most cases a week or ten days should elapse before the full diet is\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n_What are the symptoms of chronic indigestion?_\r\n\r\nThese, although familiar, are not so easily distinguished and are very\r\noften attributed to the wrong cause. There are usually general\r\nsymptoms such as indisposition, disturbed sleep, grinding of the\r\nteeth, fretfulness, languor, loss of weight and anæmia. There are\r\nbesides local symptoms: flatulence, abdominal pain, abdominal\r\ndistention, constipation, or looseness of the bowels with mucus in the\r\nstools, foul breath, coated tongue, loss of appetite, or an abnormal\r\ncapricious appetite. Such symptoms are often wrongly ascribed to\r\nintestinal worms.\r\n\r\n_What are the common causes of chronic indigestion?_\r\n\r\nThis is generally the result of a bad system of feeding, either the\r\nprolonged use of improper food or of improper methods of feeding.\r\n\r\nExamples of bad methods of feeding are, coaxing or forcing to eat,\r\nrapid eating with insufficient mastication eating between meals,\r\nallowing a child to have his own way in selecting his food, as when he\r\nlives largely upon a single article of diet. Things to be considered\r\nunder the head of improper food are, indulgence in sweets, desserts,\r\netc., the use of imperfectly cooked foods, especially cereals and\r\nvegetables, and of raw or stale fruits.\r\n\r\n_Is it not true that a diet or a special article of food which does\r\nnot make a child ill is proof that such a diet or such a food is\r\nproper for a child?_\r\n\r\nBy no means; with many people the only guide In feeding children is\r\nthat the article in question did not make the children sick, therefore\r\nit is allowable. This is a very bad principle. A better one is to\r\nadopt such a diet as will nourish the child's body with the least\r\npossible tax upon his digestive organs; in other words, to exclude\r\narticles which experience has shown to be injurious to most children.\r\n\r\n_How should chronic indigestion be managed?_\r\n\r\nThis is a much more difficult matter than the treatment of acute\r\nindigestion, for, as it is usually the result of the prolonged use of\r\nimproper food or of an improper method of feeding, a cure can be\r\naccomplished only by a discovery and removal of the cause.\r\n\r\n_Is chronic indigestion curable?_\r\n\r\nIn the vast majority of cases it is so, but only by faithfully\r\nobserving for a long period the rules for simple feeding laid down\r\nelsewhere. One of the greatest' difficulties in the way of recovery is\r\nthat parents and nurses are unwilling to follow a restricted diet long\r\nenough to secure a complete cure, or to change radically their methods\r\nof feeding, but expect the child to recover by simply taking medicine.\r\n\r\n_For how long a period is it necessary to continue very careful\r\nfeeding?_\r\n\r\nIn any case it must be done for several months; with most children for\r\ntwo or three years; with some, throughout childhood, for with them the\r\nslightest deviation from established rules is sure to provoke a\r\nrelapse.\r\n\r\n_Is not medicine useful?_\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly of assistance for the relief of some symptoms, but\r\nthe essential thing is proper feeding, without which nothing permanent\r\ncan be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN FEEDING\r\n\r\nBad habits of eating are readily acquired but difficult to break.\r\n\r\nYoung children should not be allowed to play with their food, nor\r\nshould the habit be formed of amusing or diverting them while eating,\r\nbecause by these means more food is taken.\r\n\r\nOlder children should not be permitted to make an entire meal of one\r\nthing, no matter how proper this may be.\r\n\r\nChildren, who are allowed to have their own way in matters of eating\r\nare very likely to be badly trained in other respects; while those who\r\nhave been properly trained in matters of eating can usually be easily\r\ntrained to do anything else that is important.\r\n\r\nLearning to eat proper things in a proper way forms therefore a large\r\npart of a child's early education. If careful training in these\r\nmatters is begun at the outset and continued, the results will well\r\nrepay the time and effort required.\r\n\r\nWhether the child feeds himself or is fed by the nurse, the following\r\nrules should be observed:\r\n\r\n1. Food at regular hours only; nothing between meals.\r\n\r\n2. Plenty of time should be taken. On no account should the child bolt\r\nhis food.\r\n\r\n3. The child must be taught to chew his food. Yet no matter how much\r\npains are taken in this respect, mastication is very imperfectly done\r\nby all children; hence up to the seventh year at least, all meats\r\nshould be very finely cut, all vegetables mashed to a pulp, and all\r\ngrains cooked very soft.\r\n\r\n4. Children should not be continually urged to eat if they are\r\ndisinclined to do so at their regular hours of feeding, or if the\r\nappetite is habitually poor, and under no circumstances should a child\r\nbe forced to eat.\r\n\r\n5. Indigestible food should never be given to tempt the appetite when\r\nthe ordinary simple food is refused? food should not be allowed\r\nbetween meals because it is refused at meal-time.\r\n\r\n6. One serious objection to allowing young children highly seasoned\r\nfood, entrees, jellies, pastry, sweets, etc., even in such small\r\namounts as not to upset the digestion, is that children thus indulged\r\nsoon lose appetite for the simple food which previously was taken with\r\nrelish.\r\n\r\n7. If there is any important article of a simple diet such as milk,\r\nmeat, cereals, or vegetables, which a child habitually refuses, this\r\nshould always be given first at the meal and other food withheld until\r\nit is disposed of. Children so readily form habits of eating only\r\ncertain things and refusing others that such an inclination should be\r\nchecked early.\r\n\r\n8. If an infant refuses its food altogether, or takes less than usual,\r\nthe food should be examined to see if this is right. Then the mouth\r\nshould be inspected to see if it is sore. If neither of these things\r\nis the cause, the food should be taken away and not offered again\r\nuntil the next feeding time comes.\r\n\r\n9. In any acute illness the amount of food should be much reduced and\r\nthe food made more dilute than usual. If there is fever, no solid food\r\nshould be given. If the child is already upon a milk diet, this should\r\nbe diluted, and in some cases partially peptonized.\r\n\r\n10. In very hot weather the same rules hold, to give less food,\r\nparticularly less solid food, and more water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD FORMULAS\r\n\r\n_Beef Juice._--One pound of rare round steak, cut thick, slightly\r\nbroiled, and the juice pressed out by a lemon-squeezer, or, better, a\r\nmeat-press. From two to four ounces of juice can generally be\r\nobtained. This, seasoned with salt, may be given cold, or warmed by\r\nplacing the cup which holds it in warm water. It should not be heated\r\nsufficiently to coagulate the albumin which is in solution, and which\r\nthen appears as flakes of meat floating in the fluid.\r\n\r\n_Beef Juice by the Cold Process._--One pound of finely chopped round\r\nsteak, six ounces of cold water, a pinch of salt; place in a covered\r\njar and stand on ice or in a cold place, five or six hours or\r\novernight. It is well to shake occasionally. This is now strained and\r\nall the juice squeezed out by placing the meat in coarse muslin and\r\ntwisting it very hard. It is then seasoned and fed like the above.\r\n\r\nBeef juice so made is not quite as palatable as that prepared from\r\nbroiled steak, but it is even more nutritious, and is more economical,\r\nas fully twice as much juice, can be obtained from a given quantity of\r\nmeat. Beef juice prepared in either of these ways is greatly to be\r\npreferred to the beef extracts sold.\r\n\r\n_Mutton Broth._--One pound of finely chopped lean mutton, including\r\nsome of the bone, one pint cold water, pinch of salt. Cook for three\r\nhours over a slow fire down to half a pint, adding water if necessary;\r\nstrain through muslin, and when cold carefully remove the fat, adding\r\nmore salt if required. It may be fed warm, or cold in the form of a\r\njelly.\r\n\r\nA very nutritious and delicious broth is made by thickening this with\r\ncornstarch or arrowroot, cooking for ten minutes and then adding three\r\nounces of milk, or one ounce and a half of thin cream, to a half pint\r\nof broth.\r\n\r\n_Chicken, Veal, and Beef Broths._--These are made and used in\r\nprecisely the same manner as mutton broth.\r\n\r\n_Meat Pulp._--A rare piece of round or sirloin steak, the outer part\r\nhaving been cut away, is scraped or shredded with a knife; one\r\nteaspoonful to one tablespoonful may be given, well salted, to a child\r\nof eighteen months. Scraping is much better than cutting the meat\r\nfine.\r\n\r\nFor this on a large scale, as in institutions, a Hamburg-steak cutter\r\nmay be employed.\r\n\r\n_Junket, or Curds and Whey._--One pint of fresh cow's milk, warmed;\r\npinch of salt; a teaspoonful of granulated sugar; add two teaspoonfuls\r\nof Fairchild's essence of pepsin, or liquid rennet, or one junket\r\ntablet dissolved in water; stir for a moment, and then allow it to\r\nstand at the temperature of the room for twenty minutes, or until\r\nfirmly coagulated; place in the ice box until thoroughly cold. For\r\nolder children this may be seasoned with grated nutmeg.\r\n\r\n_Whey._--The coagulated milk prepared as above is broken up with a\r\nfork and the whey strained off through muslin. It is best given cold.\r\nIf some stimulant is desired, sherry wine in the proportion of one\r\npart to twelve, or brandy one part to twenty-four, may be added. Whey\r\nis useful in many cases of acute indigestion.\r\n\r\n_Barley Jelly from the Grains._--Three tablespoonfuls of pearl barley;\r\nsoak overnight, then place this in one quart of fresh water; add pinch\r\nof salt, and cook in double boiler steadily for four hours down to one\r\npint, adding water from time to time; strain through muslin. When cold\r\nthis makes a rather thick jelly. If a thinner gruel (barley water) is\r\ndesired, one half the quantity of barley should be used.\r\n\r\n_Oat, Wheat, or Rice Jelly._--These are prepared from oatmeal, wheaten\r\ngrits, and rice grains in the same manner as the barley jelly.\r\n\r\n_Barley Jelly from the Flour._--Either Robinson's patent barley or\r\nprepared barley flour of the Health Food Company may be used. One\r\nrounded tablespoonful of the flour, thoroughly blended with a little\r\ncold water, is added, stirring, to one pint of boiling water\r\ncontaining a pinch of salt; cook for twenty minutes in a double\r\nboiler, and strain. This makes a jelly of about the consistency of\r\nthat made from the grains as above. It is essentially the same in\r\ncomposition, and much less trouble to prepare. A thinner gruel (barley\r\nwater) is made by using half the quantity of flour.\r\n\r\nWhen this is to be mixed with milk, it is well to add the milk to the\r\nbarley gruel before removing from the fire, and stir two or three\r\nminutes, or until the milk has nearly reached the boiling point, when\r\nit should be removed and bottled.\r\n\r\n_Oat or Wheat Jelly from the Flour._--These are made from the prepared\r\noat flour of the Health Food Company or Hubbell's prepared wheat\r\nflour. They are used like the barley.\r\n\r\n_Imperial Granum._--This is prepared and used in precisely the same\r\nway as the barley flour above mentioned, the gruel being mixed with\r\nmilk before it is removed from the fire.\r\n\r\n_Albumin Water._--The white of one fresh egg; half a pint of cold\r\nwater; pinch of salt; teaspoonful of brandy. This should be shaken\r\nthoroughly and fed cold either with a spoon or from a bottle. It is\r\nuseful in cases of vomiting, and can sometimes be retained by a very\r\nirritable stomach.\r\n\r\n_Lime-water._--One heaping teaspoonful of slaked lime; one quart\r\nboiled or distilled water; place in a corked bottle and shake\r\nthoroughly two or three times during the first hour. The lime should\r\nthen be allowed to settle, and after twenty-four hours the upper clear\r\nfluid carefully poured or siphoned off for use.\r\n\r\n_Dried Bread._--Either stale or fresh bread may be used; it is cut in\r\nthin slices and placed in the oven, with the door open, and quickly\r\ndried until it is crisp, but not browned. It is in many respects\r\npreferable to crackers for little children.\r\n\r\n_Coddled Egg._--A fresh egg, shell on, is placed in boiling water\r\nwhich is immediately after removed from the fire. The egg then cooks\r\nslowly in the water, which gradually cools, for seven or eight\r\nminutes, when the white should be about the consistency of jelly. For\r\na delicate digestion the white only should be given, with salt; it can\r\nbe easily separated from the yolk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOWELS\r\n\r\n_How many movements daily should an infant have during the first few\r\nweeks of life?_\r\n\r\nUsually two or three a day for the first week, and then one or two\r\neach day.\r\n\r\n_How many after a child is a month old?_\r\n\r\nA healthy child should have at least one movement each day; many have\r\ntwo and some more than two; but it is the character of the stools\r\nrather than their number which is to be taken as the evidence of\r\nperfect digestion.\r\n\r\n_What is the appearance of a healthy movement of a child who is taking\r\nnothing but milk?_\r\n\r\nIt is soft, yellow, and smooth, containing no lumps.\r\n\r\n_When are the stools dark brown or black?_\r\n\r\nWhile taking bismuth, iron, and sometimes when taking much meat or\r\nbeef juice; also while taking many of the prepared foods. They may be\r\ndark brown or black from blood. This last is a condition which may\r\nindicate serious illness.\r\n\r\n_How may a child be trained to be regular in the action of its\r\nbowels?_\r\n\r\nBy endeavouring to have them move at exactly the same time every day.\r\n\r\n_At what age may an infant be trained in this way?_\r\n\r\nUsually by the second month if training is begun early.\r\n\r\n_What is the best method of training?_\r\n\r\nA small chamber, about the size of a pint bowl, is placed between the\r\nnurse's knees, and upon this the infant is held, its back being\r\nagainst the nurse's chest and its body firmly supported. This should\r\nbe done twice a day, after the morning and afternoon feedings, and\r\nalways at the same hour. At first there may be necessary some local\r\nirritation, like that produced by tickling the anus or introducing\r\njust inside the rectum a small cone of oiled paper or a piece of soap,\r\nas a suggestion of the purpose for which the baby is placed upon the\r\nchamber; but in a surprisingly short time the position is all that is\r\nrequired. With most infants, after a few weeks the bowels will move as\r\nsoon as the infant is placed on the chamber.\r\n\r\n_What advantage has such training?_\r\n\r\nIt forms the habit of having the bowels move regularly at the same\r\nhour, which is a matter of great importance in infancy and makes\r\nregularity in childhood much easier. It also saves the nurse much\r\ntrouble and labour.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLEEP\r\n\r\n_Should a child sleep in the same bed with its mother or nurse?_\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances, if this can possibly be avoided. Very young\r\ninfants have often been smothered by their mothers, by overlying\r\nduring sleep. If the infant sleeps with the mother, there is always\r\nthe temptation to frequent nursing at night, which is injurious to\r\nboth mother and child. Older children also should, if possible, have\r\nseparate beds; many contagious diseases and bad habits are contracted\r\nby children sleeping together.\r\n\r\n_How should an infant's bed be prepared?_\r\n\r\nThe mattress should be firm but soft, the pillow very thin, and the\r\ncovering not excessive. A baby should not be allowed to sleep always\r\nin the same position, but should be changed from side to side. Hair\r\npillows are useful in summer and for children who perspire very much.\r\n\r\n_How much sleep is natural for a newly born baby?_\r\n\r\nA baby with a good digestion and proper food will usually sleep at\r\nthis period about nine tenths of the time.\r\n\r\n_How much should a baby sleep at six months?_\r\n\r\nAbout two thirds of the time.\r\n\r\n_Up to what age should an older child take a nap during the day?_\r\n\r\nAlways until four years old, and if possible longer.\r\n\r\n_At what age may an infant go all night without feeding?_\r\n\r\nAt five months a child should not be fed or nursed between 10 P.M. and\r\n6 A.M. At two years a child can easily go from 6 P.M. to 6 A.M.\r\nwithout feeding.\r\n\r\n_How should a baby be put to sleep?_\r\n\r\nThe room should be darkened and quiet, the child's hunger satisfied,\r\nand the child made generally comfortable and laid in its crib while\r\nawake.\r\n\r\n_Is rocking necessary?_\r\n\r\nBy no means. It is a habit easily acquired, but hard to break, and a\r\nvery useless and sometimes injurious one. The same may be said of\r\nsucking a rubber nipple, or \"pacifier,\" and all other devices for\r\nputting children to sleep.\r\n\r\n_What are the principal causes of disturbed sleep?_\r\n\r\nAs quiet peaceful sleep is a sign of perfect health, disorders of\r\nsleep may be produced by almost anything which is wrong with the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n1. Habitual disturbance of sleep in infants is most frequently\r\nassociated with the food or feeding. It may be from the discomfort of\r\nchronic indigestion due to improper food. In bottle-fed infants it is\r\noften the result of overfeeding; in those who are nursed it is often\r\ndue to hunger. A common cause is frequent night feeding; an infant who\r\nis fed three or four times during the night is almost invariably a bad\r\nsleeper.\r\n\r\n2. Disturbed sleep or sleeplessness may be due to causes purely\r\nnervous. Such are bad habits acquired by faulty training; as when the\r\nnursery is lighted and the child taken from its crib whenever it wakes\r\nor cries; or when some of the contrivances for inducing sleep have\r\nbeen used. Any excitement or romping play just before bedtime, and\r\nfears aroused by pictures or stories, are frequent causes. Children\r\nwho inherit from their parents a nervous constitution are especially\r\nlikely to suffer thus.\r\n\r\n3. There may be physical discomfort from cold feet, insufficient or\r\ntoo much clothing, or want of fresh air in the sleeping room.\r\n\r\n4. Interference with breathing due to obstruction from large tonsils\r\nor adenoids. These cause great restlessness and lead a child to assume\r\nmany different postures during sleep, often lying upon the face or\r\nupon the hands and knees.\r\n\r\n5. Chronic pains or frequently recurring night pains may be causes of\r\ndisordered sleep, when a child wakes with a sudden sharp cry. In\r\ninfants this is most often due to scurvy, sometimes to syphilis. In\r\nolder children it may be the earliest symptom of disease of the hip or\r\nspine.\r\n\r\n6. Sleeplessness and disturbed sleep are frequent whenever the general\r\ncondition falls much below a healthy standard; e.g., in infants who\r\nare not thriving and in children suffering from marked anæmia.\r\n\r\n_How are children who sleep too little, or whose sleep is constantly\r\ndisturbed, to be treated?_\r\n\r\nNever by the use of soothing sirups or other medicines. Successful\r\ntreatment consists in the discovery and removal of the cause.\r\n\r\n_Do children ever sleep too much?_\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful if healthy children ever do. Excessive sleep is an\r\nimportant symptom of some diseases of the brain. Otherwise it seldom\r\nif ever occurs unless soothing sirups or other drugs have been given.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISE\r\n\r\n_Is exercise important for infants?_\r\n\r\nIt is as necessary for them as for older children.\r\n\r\n_How is it obtained?_\r\n\r\nA young baby gets its exercise by screaming, waving its arms, kicking,\r\netc. The clothing should not be so tight as to make these movements\r\nimpossible. At least twice a day the infant should be allowed for\r\nfifteen or twenty minutes the free use of its limbs by permitting it\r\nto lie upon a bed in a warm room, with all clothing except the shirt,\r\nstockings, and napkin removed. Later, when in short clothes, the baby\r\nmay be put upon a thick blanket or quilt laid upon the floor, and be\r\nallowed to tumble about at will. A nursery fence two feet high, made\r\nto surround a mattress, is an excellent device and makes a convenient\r\nbox stall for the young animal, where it can learn to use both its\r\narms and legs without the danger of injury. Only by exercise such as\r\nthis do the muscles have an opportunity to develop properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRY\r\n\r\n_When is crying useful?_\r\n\r\nIn the newly born infant the cry expands the lungs, and it is\r\nnecessary that it should be repeated for a few minutes every day in\r\norder to keep them well expanded.\r\n\r\n_How much crying is normal for a very young baby?_\r\n\r\nFrom fifteen to thirty minutes a day is not too much.\r\n\r\n_What is the nature of this cry?_\r\n\r\nIt is loud and strong. Infants get red in the face with it; in fact,\r\nit is a scream. This is necessary for health. It is the baby's\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n_When is a cry abnormal?_\r\n\r\nWhen it is too long or too frequent. The abnormal cry is rarely\r\nstrong, often it is a moaning or a worrying cry, sometimes only a\r\nfeeble whine.\r\n\r\n_What are the causes of such crying?_\r\n\r\nPain, temper, hunger, illness, and habit.\r\n\r\n_What is the cry of pain?_\r\n\r\nIt is usually strong and sharp, but not generally continuous. It is\r\naccompanied by contraction of the features, drawing up of the legs,\r\nand other symptoms of distress.\r\n\r\n_What is the cry of hunger?_\r\n\r\nIt is usually a continuous, fretful cry, rarely strong and lusty.\r\n\r\n_What is the cry of temper?_\r\n\r\nIt is loud and strong and accompanied by kicking or stiffening of the\r\nbody, and is usually violent.\r\n\r\n_What is the cry of illness?_\r\n\r\nThere is usually more of fretfulness and moaning than real crying,\r\nalthough crying is excited by very slight causes.\r\n\r\n_What is the cry of indulgence or from habit?_\r\n\r\nThis is often heard even in very young infants, who cry to be rocked,\r\nto be carried about, sometimes for a light in the room, for a bottle\r\nto suck, or for the continuance of any other bad habit which has been\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\n_How can we be sure that a child is crying to be indulged?_\r\n\r\nIf it stops immediately when it gets what it wants, and cries when it\r\nis withdrawn or withheld.\r\n\r\n_What should be done if a baby cries at night?_\r\n\r\nOne should get up and see that the child is comfortable--the clothing\r\nsmooth under the body, the hands and feet warm, and the napkin not wet\r\nor soiled. If all these matters are properly adjusted and the child\r\nsimply crying to be taken up, it should not be further interfered\r\nwith. If the night cry is habitual some other cause should be sought\r\n(see page 121).\r\n\r\n_How is an infant to be managed that cries from temper, habit, or to\r\nbe indulged?_\r\n\r\nIt should simply be allowed to \"cry it out.\" This often requires an\r\nhour, and in extreme cases, two or three hours. A second struggle will\r\nseldom last more than ten or fifteen minutes, and a third will rarely\r\nbe necessary. Such discipline is not to be carried out unless one is\r\nsure as to the cause of the habitual crying.\r\n\r\n_Is it likely that rupture will be caused from crying?_\r\n\r\nNot in young infants if the abdominal band is properly applied, and\r\nnot after a year under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFTING CHILDREN\r\n\r\n_How should a young baby be lifted from its bed?_\r\n\r\nThe right hand should grasp the clothing below the feet, and the left\r\nhand should be slipped beneath the infant's body to its head. It is\r\nthen raised upon the left arm.\r\n\r\n_What is the advantage of this?_\r\n\r\nThe entire spine is supported, and no undue pressure is made upon the\r\nchest or abdomen, as often happens if the baby is grasped around the\r\nbody or under the arms.\r\n\r\n_How should a child old enough to run about be lifted?_\r\n\r\nAlways by placing the hands under the child's arms, and never by the\r\nwrists.\r\n\r\n_What injury may be inflicted by lifting the child by the wrists or\r\nhands?_\r\n\r\nOften serious injury is done to the elbow or shoulder joints.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\n_What is the normal temperature of an infant?_\r\n\r\nThe normal temperature varies more than in adults. In the rectum it\r\nusually fluctuates between 98° and 99.5° F.; a rectal temperature of\r\n97.5° F. or of 100.5° F. is of no importance whatever unless it\r\ncontinues.\r\n\r\n_Where should the temperature of infants and young children be taken?_\r\n\r\nThe rectum is altogether the best place, and next to this the groin.\r\nThe rectal temperature is from half a degree to a degree higher than\r\nthat in the groin.\r\n\r\n_How long should the thermometer be left in place to take the\r\ntemperature?_\r\n\r\nTwo minutes in the rectum, and five minutes in the groin.\r\n\r\n_Is the temperature of a young child a good guide as to the severity\r\nof its symptoms in illness?_\r\n\r\nAs a rule it is. A temperature of 100° to 102° F. commonly means a mild\r\nillness, and one of 104° F. or over a serious one. The duration of the\r\nfever is, however, even more important than the height of the\r\ntemperature. It should be remembered that in all young children slight\r\ncauses often produce a high temperature which lasts for a few hours;\r\none should not therefore be unduly alarmed unless the temperature\r\ncontinues high, or is accompanied by other important signs of illness.\r\n\r\n_Is not a high temperature a more serious symptom in a young child\r\nthan in an adult?_\r\n\r\nThe opposite is rather the case. Young children are extremely\r\nsensitive to conditions which produce fever, and the thermometer often\r\ngives an exaggerated idea of the severity of the symptoms. A cause\r\nwhich in an adult might produce a temperature of 102° F. or 103° F.,\r\nin a young child would very likely be accompanied by a temperature of\r\n104° or 105° F.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUSNESS\r\n\r\n_What are the principal causes of excessive nervousness in infants and\r\nyoung children, and what can be done to prevent this?_\r\n\r\nThe most important cause is the delicate structure of the brain at\r\nthis time, and its rapid growth. It grows as much during the first\r\nyear as during all the rest of life. This requires quiet and peaceful\r\nsurroundings. Infants who are naturally nervous should be left much\r\nalone, should see but few people, should be played with very little,\r\nand should never be quieted with soothing sirups or the \"pacifier.\"\r\n\r\n_At what age may playing with babies be begun?_\r\n\r\nBabies under six months old should never be played with; and the less\r\nof it at any time the better for the infant.\r\n\r\n_What harm is done by playing with very young babies?_\r\n\r\nThey are made nervous and irritable, sleep badly and suffer from\r\nindigestion and in many other respects.\r\n\r\n_When may young children be played with?_\r\n\r\nIf at all, in the morning, or after the midday nap; but never just\r\nbefore bedtime.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOYS\r\n\r\n_What points should guide one in selecting toys and playthings for an\r\ninfant?_\r\n\r\nThe instinct in a baby to put everything into the mouth is so strong\r\nthat nothing should be given that cannot be safely treated in this\r\nway. Hence one should choose things which are smooth, those which can\r\nbe easily washed, and those which cannot be swallowed.\r\n\r\nOne should avoid (1) toys with sharp points or corners; (2) those with\r\nloose parts that might be detached or broken off and swallowed; (3)\r\nsmall objects which might be swallowed or pushed into the nose or ear,\r\nsuch as coins, marbles, and safety-pins, also beads and buttons unless\r\nstrung upon a stout cord; (4) painted toys; (5) those covered with\r\nhair or wool. Infants have often been severely injured by swallowing\r\nwhat they have pulled off from their small toy animals.\r\n\r\n_What points are to be considered in selecting the toys and playthings\r\nof a child over two years old?_\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that toys are not merely a source of\r\namusement, but that they have an educational value as well. Those are\r\ntherefore to be preferred the use of which develops the child's\r\nimagination, and with which he can be taught to amuse himself. For\r\nboys nothing can surpass blocks, toy soldiers, balls, engines, and\r\ncars; and for girls, dolls and housekeeping sets. The complicated\r\nmechanical toys now so much in vogue give only a momentary pleasure,\r\nand as soon as the wonder at their operation has worn off, they have\r\nlost interest for the child except that which he gets in breaking them\r\nto see how the thing worked.\r\n\r\n_What important things can be taught children with their toys and how\r\nmay this be done?_\r\n\r\nThe imagination may be developed, and children may be trained to\r\nhabits of neatness, order and regularity and to concentration of mind.\r\n\r\nTo this end toys should be kept in an orderly way upon a shelf in the\r\nnursery or in a closet, never piled in a miscellaneous heap in the\r\ncorner of the room. Children should select their toys and play with\r\none thing at a time, which they should be taught to put away in its\r\nplace before another is given. They should never be allowed to have a\r\ndozen things strewn about the room at one time, with none of which\r\nthey are occupied.\r\n\r\n\r\nKISSING\r\n\r\n_Are there any valid objections to kissing infants?_\r\n\r\nThere are many serious objections. Tuberculosis, diphtheria, and many\r\nother grave diseases may be communicated in this way. The kissing of\r\ninfants upon the mouth by other children, by nurses, or by people\r\ngenerally, should under no circumstances be permitted. Infants should\r\nbe kissed, if at all, upon the cheek or forehead, but the less even of\r\nthis the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVULSIONS\r\n\r\n_What should be done for a child in convulsions before a doctor\r\narrives?_\r\n\r\nKeep the child perfectly quiet with ice at the head, put the feet in a\r\nmustard bath, and roll the entire body in large towels which have been\r\ndipped in mustard water (two heaping tablespoonfuls of mustard to one\r\nquart of tepid water), and have plenty of hot water and a bath tub at\r\nhand, so that the doctor can give a hot bath if he thinks it\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\n_When is a hot bath useful?_\r\n\r\nIf the convulsions have continued until the pulse is weak, the face\r\nvery pale, the nails and lips blue, and the feet and hands cold, the\r\nhot bath will be useful by bringing blood to the surface and relieving\r\nthe heart, lungs, and brain.\r\n\r\n_How should the bath be given?_\r\n\r\nThe temperature should not be over 106° F.; this should always be\r\ntested by a thermometer if one can be obtained. Without this\r\nprecaution, in the excitement of the moment, infants have frequently\r\nbeen put into baths so hot that serious and even fatal burns have been\r\nproduced. If no thermometer is available the nurse may plunge her arm\r\nto the elbow into the water. It should feel warm, but not so hot as to\r\nbe at all uncomfortable. One half a teacupful of powdered mustard\r\nadded to the bath often adds to its efficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN BODIES\r\n\r\n_What should be done if a foreign body has been swallowed?_\r\n\r\nFirst, examine the throat with the finger to see if it has lodged\r\nthere, and if so remove it. If it has passed from the throat it has\r\nusually gone into the stomach.\r\n\r\n_What should be done in this case?_\r\n\r\nGive the child plenty of dry food, like bread, potato, etc., but under\r\nno circumstances either an emetic or cathartic. An infant may have its\r\nusual food.\r\n\r\n_What harm would a cathartic do?_\r\n\r\nIt is likely to hurry the foreign body too rapidly through the\r\nintestine and in this way do harm; otherwise it becomes coated with\r\nfecal matter and passes the intestine usually without doing injury.\r\n\r\n_What should be done if a child gets a foreign body into the ear?_\r\n\r\nUnless this can easily be removed with the fingers it should not be\r\nmeddled with, for it is likely to be pushed farther into the ear. The\r\nchild should be taken to a physician.\r\n\r\n_What should be done if there is a foreign body in the nose?_\r\n\r\nThe child should blow his nose strongly while the empty nostril is\r\ncompressed. Unless this removes it a physician should be called.\r\nMeddlesome interference is always harmful.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLIC\r\n\r\n_What are the symptoms of colic?_\r\n\r\nThere is a strong, hard cry, which comes suddenly and returns every\r\nfew minutes. With this there is drawing up of the feet, contraction of\r\nthe muscles of the face, and other signs of pain. The abdomen is\r\nusually tense and hard.\r\n\r\n_What should be done for a baby with colic?_\r\n\r\nFirst, see that the feet are warm. Place them against a hot-water bag,\r\nor hold them before an open fire; apply a hot flannel to the abdomen,\r\nor let the child lie upon its stomach across a hot-water bag. If the\r\ncolic continues, a half teacupful of warm water containing ten drops\r\nof turpentine may be injected into the bowels with a syringe; at the\r\nsame time the abdomen should be gently rubbed so as to start the wind.\r\nIf the gas is in the stomach, half of a soda mint tablet may be given\r\nin a tablespoonful of very warm water.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARACHE\r\n\r\n_What are the symptoms of earache?_\r\n\r\nThe pain is generally severe and accompanied by a sharp scream; the\r\nchild often puts the hand to the affected ear, or cries whenever it is\r\ntouched. The pain is likely to be prolonged and continuous.\r\n\r\n_How should a child with earache be treated?_\r\n\r\nThe ear should be irrigated with a solution of boric acid (twenty\r\ngrains to the ounce) as warm as can be borne. Dry heat may then be\r\napplied in several ways. The ear having been first covered with\r\ncotton, a small hot-water bag or one filled with hot salt or bran, may\r\nbe bound over it with a bandage; or a small butter plate heated in hot\r\nwater may be used in the same way. The hot-water bag may be held\r\nagainst the ear or the child may lie with his head upon it. The use of\r\nsuch substances as oil and laudanum in the ear is not to be\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROUP\r\n\r\n_What are the symptoms of croup?_\r\n\r\nThere is a hollow, dry, barking cough, with some difficulty in\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\n_When is this likely to come on?_\r\n\r\nUsually at night.\r\n\r\n_Is simple croup dangerous?_\r\n\r\nThe ordinary croup of infants is spasmodic croup, and is very rarely\r\ndangerous, although the symptoms seem very alarming.\r\n\r\n_What are the symptoms?_\r\n\r\nIn a mild attack there is simply noisy breathing, especially on\r\ndrawing in the breath, with a tight, barking, or croupy cough. In a\r\nsevere attack the child's breathing is more noisy and becomes\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n_What is the dangerous form of croup?_\r\n\r\nMembranous croup, which is the same thing as diphtheria of the larynx.\r\n\r\n_How does this develop?_\r\n\r\nGradually; very rarely does it come on suddenly.\r\n\r\n_What should be done for a baby who has spasmodic croup?_\r\n\r\nThe room should be very warm, hot cloths or poultices should be\r\napplied over the throat, and either a croup kettle or an ordinary\r\ntea-kettle kept boiling in the room. This is more efficacious if the\r\nchild is placed in a tent made by a raised umbrella with a sheet\r\nthrown over it, and the steam introduced beneath the tent. If the\r\nsymptoms are urgent, ten drops of the sirup of ipecac should be given\r\nevery fifteen minutes until free vomiting occurs. Whenever the\r\nsymptoms reach a point where breathing becomes difficult, a doctor\r\nshould be summoned without delay.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUS DISEASES\r\n\r\n_What are the first symptoms of measles?_\r\n\r\nMeasles comes on rather gradually with cough, sneezing, watery eyes\r\nand nose, much like an ordinary cold in the head. The eruption appears\r\nafter three or four days, first upon the face and neck as small red\r\nspots, and spreads slowly over the body.\r\n\r\n_Is measles a serious disease?_\r\n\r\nIn infants and during the winter season it is likely to be very\r\nserious on account of the danger of bronchitis and pneumonia, which\r\nfrequently accompany it. In children over four years old it is\r\ngenerally not severe. No child should be voluntarily exposed to this\r\ndisease, and particularly one who is delicate or prone to disease of\r\nthe lungs should be protected against it.\r\n\r\n_When and how is measles contagious?_\r\n\r\nMeasles may readily be conveyed from the very beginning of the\r\ncatarrh, two or three days before any eruption is present. It is not\r\noften carried by healthy persons. Its poison does not cling long to a\r\nsick room.\r\n\r\n_What is German measles?_\r\n\r\nGerman measles, or rubella, is a distinct disease and has nothing to\r\ndo with ordinary measles. It is extremely rare for a child to be much\r\nsick with it. There is usually a very extensive eruption which may\r\ncover the body, but few other symptoms.\r\n\r\n_What are the first symptoms of scarlet fever?_\r\n\r\nGenerally it comes suddenly, with vomiting, high fever, and sore\r\nthroat. The eruption usually appears within twenty-four hours as a red\r\nblush, first upon the neck and chest, and spreads rapidly.\r\n\r\n_When and how is scarlet fever contagious?_\r\n\r\nScarlet fever is only slightly contagious for the first one or two\r\ndays of the attack. It is most contagious at the height of the disease\r\nand during desquamation. It may be carried by healthy persons and by\r\nthe clothing or bedding from the sick room.\r\n\r\n_How does whooping-cough begin?_\r\n\r\nFor a week or ten days it cannot be distinguished from an ordinary\r\ncold on the chest. Then the attacks of coughing gradually become more\r\nsevere and vomiting may follow. After a severe coughing fit the breath\r\nis caught with a peculiar noise known as the \"whoop.\"\r\n\r\n_How does chicken-pox begin?_\r\n\r\nIt usually comes out gradually, as widely scattered pimples over the\r\nscalp, face, and body, many of which soon become small vesicles,\r\nresembling tiny blisters. There is itching and local discomfort but\r\nlittle fever, and the child rarely seems to be very ill.\r\n\r\n_How does diphtheria begin?_\r\n\r\nSometimes suddenly, but usually gradually, with sore throat and\r\nswelling of the glands of the neck, with white patches upon the\r\ntonsils, or a free discharge which may be bloody, from the nostrils.\r\n\r\n_How does mumps begin?_\r\n\r\nAs a swelling upon the jaw, beneath the ear. As it increases it\r\nextends forward upon the cheek and backward behind the ear. It affects\r\none or both sides.\r\n\r\nMumps is not very common in young children, and in them it is usually\r\nmild. After twelve or thirteen years it is likely to be more severe.\r\n\r\n_How long after exposure do the first symptoms appear in the different\r\ndiseases?_\r\n\r\nIn scarlet fever in from three to five days, rarely later than a week;\r\nin measles in from nine to fourteen days, occasionally as late as\r\ntwenty days; in whooping-cough in from one to two weeks; in\r\nchicken-pox in from fourteen to sixteen days; in German measles in\r\nfrom ten to sixteen days. In diphtheria the time varies much; it may\r\nbe only one day, and it may be one or two weeks. In mumps it is\r\nusually a little less than three weeks, the average being twenty days.\r\n\r\n_Which of these diseases are most contagious?_\r\n\r\nMeasles and chicken-pox are very contagious, and very few children who\r\nhave not had them can come near a person suffering from either disease\r\nwithout taking it. Whooping-cough is almost as contagious as measles,\r\nand for young babies even more so. A very close exposure is not\r\nnecessary in the case of either of these diseases, and whooping-cough\r\ncan undoubtedly be contracted in the open air. Scarlet fever and\r\ndiphtheria are much less contagious; for both of these a pretty close\r\nexposure is necessary.\r\n\r\n_How long should a child with any of these diseases be kept away from\r\nother children?_\r\n\r\nWith measles, for two weeks after the rash has gone; with scarlet\r\nfever, for at least four weeks after the rash has gone, and longer if\r\nthe peeling is not over or if the ears are running; with\r\nwhooping-cough, for two months, or so long as the paroxysmal cough\r\ncontinues; with chicken-pox, until all crusts have fallen off, or for\r\nabout three weeks after the eruption appears; with German measles for\r\none week after the eruption has faded; with diphtheria, at least ten\r\ndays after the throat is well in a very mild case, and four weeks if\r\nthe case has been severe; with mumps for one week after the swelling\r\nhas gone.\r\n\r\n_What should be done when a child shows the first symptoms of serious\r\nillness?_\r\n\r\nThe child should be put to bed. If it is an infant the food should be\r\ndiluted to one half the usual strength; if an older child, only fluid\r\nfood should be given. If the child seems feverish, take the\r\ntemperature If the bowels are constipated, give a teaspoonful of\r\ncastor oil; but no other medicine without the doctor's orders. Send\r\nfor the doctor at once, and until he comes carefully exclude all other\r\nchildren from the room.\r\n\r\n_By what nursery training may the examination and treatment of sick\r\nchildren he made much easier?_\r\n\r\nBy teaching all children to gargle, to show the throat, to take pills,\r\nand by constantly teaching them to regard the doctor as the child's\r\nbest friend, and his visits as a great treat. On no account should a\r\nchild be frightened into obedience by threats of what the doctor will\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nWith care and patience most children may be taught to gargle and take\r\npills at four or five years, and to show the throat willingly at two\r\nor three. All these matters should be made a part of the child's\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCURVY\r\n\r\n_What is scurvy and how is it produced?_\r\n\r\nScurvy is a disease of general nutrition, usually caused by the\r\nlong-continued use of improper food. Most of the cases come from the\r\nuse of the prepared infant's foods sold in the stores, especially when\r\nthey are given without fresh milk; occasionally the use of condensed\r\nmilk and of sterilized milk is followed by scurvy; sometimes it is\r\nseen when, owing to feeble digestion, it has been necessary to make\r\ncow's milk very weak for a long time.\r\n\r\n_What symptoms are seen in an infant with scurvy?_\r\n\r\nAt first there is only indefinite and occasional soreness in the legs\r\nso that the child cries out when handled. As this soreness becomes\r\nmore severe the child is often thought to have rheumatism. The gums\r\nswell and are of a deep purple colour. There may be bleeding from the\r\ngums, nose, bowels, or black-and-blue spots may be seen upon the legs.\r\nThe ankles and knees may swell. The child grows very pale, loses\r\nappetite and weight, and sleeps badly.\r\n\r\n_What should be done when an infant shows signs of scurvy?_\r\n\r\nThe diet should at once be changed to fresh milk, properly modified\r\naccording to the child's digestion, but not sterilized or pasteurized.\r\nThe juice of a sweet orange should be given, best about an hour before\r\nthe feeding. At first one or two teaspoonfuls, four or five times a\r\nday; later, more may be given if the symptoms are not improved.\r\n\r\nProperly treated an infant with scurvy generally recovers promptly and\r\ncompletely. If not recognised, or untreated, it may cause death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION\r\n\r\n_When it is necessary to move the bowels immediately, what are some of\r\nthe easiest methods?_\r\n\r\nAn injection of one tablespoonful of sweet oil may be given, or half a\r\nteaspoonful of glycerine in one tablespoonful of water, or a teacupful\r\nof tepid soap and water, or a glycerine suppository. None of these\r\nshould be continued excepting under the physician's directions.\r\n\r\n_What sort of a syringe is to be preferred for giving an injection to\r\nan infant?_\r\n\r\nThe bulb syringe is the simplest; this consists of an oval bulb of\r\nsoft rubber and a soft rubber or a hard rubber tip. It holds one or\r\ntwo ounces.\r\n\r\n_What is the most essential thing in preventing or overcoming\r\nconstipation?_\r\n\r\nThe formation of the habit of having the bowels move every day\r\nregularly at the same hour, and proper early training (see page 156).\r\n\r\n_What is the best hour?_\r\n\r\nIn most cases immediately after the first meal in the morning.\r\n\r\n_What are some simple means by which constipation may be relieved?_\r\n\r\nThe best are diet, suppositories, and massage.\r\n\r\nThe changes to be made in the milk of constipated infants have been\r\nmentioned on page 82. The addition to the milk of some of the malted\r\nfoods, such as Mellin's food or malted milk, is sometimes useful. For\r\nlittle children the fruit juices are particularly beneficial when\r\ngiven half an hour or more before the first morning feeding, with half\r\na glass of water.\r\n\r\nFor older children the amount of white bread, toast, and potato,\r\nshould be reduced, and green vegetables oatmeal, and Graham bread\r\ngiven, with plenty of fruit twice a day. Raw scraped apples are\r\nsometimes of more value than any other fruit.\r\n\r\nThe best suppositories for continuous use are probably the gluten\r\nsuppositories of the Health Food Company. One should be given the\r\nfirst thing in the morning. They act rather slowly, usually in about\r\ntwo hours. In obstinate cases one may also be used at bedtime.\r\nGlycerine suppositories act more quickly, but are too irritating for\r\nregular use.\r\n\r\nMassage consists in rubbing the abdomen, which may be done in one of\r\ntwo ways: Beginning at the right groin, the hand is carried up to the\r\nribs, then across to the opposite side, then around to the left groin.\r\nThe abdomen is stroked gently at first, and afterward deeper pressure\r\nused as the child becomes accustomed to it. The second method is by\r\nrubbing the deeper parts with a circular movement--the fingers not\r\nmoving upon the skin--making a series of small circles, beginning at\r\nthe right groin and following the same course as described above.\r\nEither method should be employed for six or eight minutes twice a day,\r\nat almost any regular time, except soon after a meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA\r\n\r\n_In case a child is taken with diarrhoea, what should be done?_\r\n\r\nWith a moderate looseness of the bowels in an older child, solid food\r\nshould be stopped, and boiled milk given diluted with gruel; the child\r\nshould be kept perfectly quiet, as walking about always aggravates\r\nsuch a disturbance. If the symptoms are more severe and attended by\r\nfever and vomiting, all milk should be stopped at once, and only\r\nbroth, barley water, or some thin gruel given. Some cathartic, usually\r\ncastor oil, is required with a severe attack.\r\n\r\nIf the patient is an infant, the milk should be diluted and especially\r\nshould the fat be reduced (see page 76). In severe attacks with\r\nvomiting or frequent foul stools, all food should be stopped for at\r\nleast twelve hours and all milk for a longer time, and the bowels\r\nfreely moved by a cathartic.\r\n\r\n_Why is a cathartic necessary if the movements are already frequent?_\r\n\r\nSuch movements are nearly always due to an irritation in the bowel,\r\nset up by the fermenting food which has not been digested. The\r\ndiarrhoea is Nature's effort to get rid of the irritant. Nothing to\r\nstop the movements should be given until the bowels have been\r\nthoroughly cleared by the treatment mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAD HABITS\r\n\r\n_What are the most common bad habits of young children?_\r\n\r\nSucking, nail-biting, dirt-eating, bed-wetting, and masturbation.\r\n\r\n_What do children suck?_\r\n\r\nMost frequently the thumbs or fingers, sometimes the clothing or\r\nblanket; often the \"pacifier\" or rubber nipple.\r\n\r\n_When is this habit most frequently seen?_\r\n\r\nIt begins in quite early infancy, and if not broken may last until\r\nchildren are six or seven years old.\r\n\r\n_Is the sucking habit a harmful one?_\r\n\r\nWhen persisted in it may produce a misshapen mouth or fingers. It\r\nconstantly stimulates the flow of saliva and certainly aggravates\r\ndisturbances of digestion during which the sucking habit is likely to\r\nbe practised. It may lead to thrush or other forms of infection of the\r\nmouth. It is not necessary as a means of quieting a child, though it\r\nmay in some degree cover up the consequences of bad feeding or bad\r\ntraining. On no account should the habit of sucking the \"pacifier\" be\r\nallowed as a means of putting children to sleep, or of quieting them\r\nwhile restless from dentition or indigestion.\r\n\r\n_How is the sucking habit to be controlled?_\r\n\r\nOne should be sure in the first place that the constant sucking of\r\nfingers is not due to hunger from insufficient food. Sucking of the\r\nhands may often be controlled by wearing mittens or fastening the\r\nhands to the sides during sleep. In more obstinate cases it may be\r\nnecessary to confine the elbow by small pasteboard splints to prevent\r\nthe child from bending the arm so as to get the hand to the mouth.\r\n\r\n_When are nail-biting and dirt-eating seen, and how are they to be\r\ncontrolled?_\r\n\r\nThese habits belong especially to children over three years old. They\r\nare seen particularly in those who are excessively nervous or whose\r\ngeneral health is below par; sometimes in those who develop serious\r\nnervous diseases later in life. Children with such tendencies should\r\nbe closely watched, and every means used to break up these habits\r\nearly. Dirt-eating is a morbid craving which is rarely seen in a\r\nnormal child.\r\n\r\n_At what age may a child generally be expected to go without wetting\r\nthe bed during the night?_\r\n\r\nUsually at two and a half years, if it is taken up late in the\r\nevening. Some children acquire control of the bladder at night when\r\ntwo years old, and a few not until three years. After three years\r\nhabitual bed-wetting is abnormal.\r\n\r\n_How should a young child addicted to bed-wetting be managed?_\r\n\r\nAt three or four years of age, punishments are sometimes useful,\r\nespecially when it seems to depend more upon the child's indifference\r\nthan anything else. They are of no value in older children, rewards\r\nbeing much more efficacious. In all cases one should give a child\r\nplenty of milk and water early in the day, but no fluids after 4 P.M.,\r\nthe supper being always of solid or semi-solid food. The child\r\nshould be taken up regularly at ten o'clock or thereabouts. It often\r\nhappens that the formation or continuance of the habit is due to the\r\nchild being in poor general condition, to some irritation in the\r\nurine, or in the genital organs. Unless the simple means mentioned are\r\nsuccessful the child should be placed under the charge of a physician.\r\n\r\n_What is masturbation?_\r\n\r\nIt is the habit of rubbing the genital organs with the hands, with the\r\nclothing, against the bed, or rubbing the thighs together. Sometimes\r\nthe child sits upon the floor, crosses its thighs tightly and rocks\r\nbackward and forward. Many of these things are passed over lightly and\r\nare regarded for months as simply a \"queer trick\" of the child. It may\r\nbe seen at any age, even in those not more than a year old, and in\r\nboth sexes.\r\n\r\n_How should such a child be treated?_\r\n\r\nMasturbation is the most injurious of all the bad habits, and should\r\nbe broken up just as early as possible. Children should especially be\r\nwatched at the time of going to sleep and on first waking. Punishments\r\nand mechanical restraint are of little avail except with infants. With\r\nolder children they usually make matters worse. Rewards are much more\r\nefficacious. It is of the utmost importance to watch the child\r\nclosely, to keep his confidence, and by all possible means to teach\r\nself-control.\r\n\r\nSome local cause of irritation is often present, which can be removed.\r\nMedical advice should at once be sought.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINATION\r\n\r\n_Nowadays when small-pox occurs so seldom is it necessary to have\r\nevery child vaccinated?_\r\n\r\nIt should by all means be done. It is only by the practice of general\r\nvaccination that small-pox is kept down. In countries or in\r\ncommunities where vaccination is neglected, frightful outbreaks of\r\nsmall-pox occur every now and then just as in olden times.\r\n\r\n_What is the best time for vaccination?_\r\n\r\nThe time usually selected is from the third to the sixth month. It may\r\nbe deferred in a very delicate child who is not likely to be exposed\r\nto small-pox, or in a child suffering from any form of skin disease.\r\n\r\n_Which is preferable for vaccination, the arm or the leg?_\r\n\r\nThe part which can be most easily protected and kept at rest is to be\r\nchosen. In infants who do not yet walk or creep, the leg is to be\r\npreferred? in older children, in most circumstances, the arm. If older\r\nchildren are vaccinated on the leg, they should not be allowed to walk\r\nmuch while the vaccination is active.\r\n\r\n_When should vaccination be repeated?_\r\n\r\nAn unsuccessful vaccination proves nothing and should be repeated in\r\ntwo or three weeks. If success fully vaccinated in infancy, a child\r\nshould invariably be revaccinated before puberty. If exposed or likely\r\nto be exposed to small-pox at any time vaccination should be repeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Weight chart for the first year; the curved line\r\nindicates the average rate of gain.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Weight chart, one to fourteen years.
