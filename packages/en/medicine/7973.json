Of the great majority of\r\nthe 600 thousand who had crossed the Niemen in the month of June Anno\r\n1812, there was recorded in the list of their regiments, in the\r\narchives “_Disappeared during the Retreat_” and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWhen the few who had come home, those hollow eyed specters with their\r\nfrozen hands, were asked about these comrades who had disappeared\r\nduring the retreat, they could give no information, but they would\r\nspeak of endless, of never-heard-of sufferings in the icy deserts of\r\nthe north, of the cruelty of the Cossacks, of the atrocious acts of the\r\nMoushiks and the peasants of Lithuania, and, worst of all, of the\r\ninfernal acts of the people of Wilna. And it would break the heart of\r\nthose who listened to them.\r\n\r\nThere is a medical history of the hundreds of thousands who have\r\nperished Anno 1812 in Russia from cold, hunger, fatigue or misery.\r\n\r\nSuch medical history cannot be intelligible without some details of the\r\nhistory of events causing and surrounding the deaths from cold and\r\nhunger and fatigue. And such a history I have attempted to write.\r\n\r\nCasting a glance on the map on which the battle fields on the march to\r\nand from Moscow are marked, we notice that it was not a deep thrust\r\nwhich the attack of the French army had made into the colossus of\r\nRussia. From the Niemen to Mohilew, Ostrowno, Polotsk, Krasnoi, the\r\nfirst time, Smolensk, Walutina, Borodino, Conflagration of Moscow, and\r\non the retreat the battles of Winkonow, Jaroslawetz, Wiasma, Vop,\r\nKrasnoi, the second time, Beresina, Wilna, Kowno; this is not a great\r\ndistance, says Paul Holzhausen in his book “Die Deutschen in Russland\r\n1812” but a great piece of history.\r\n\r\nHolzhausen, whose book has furnished the most valuable material of\r\nwhich I could avail myself besides the dissertation of von Scherer, the\r\nbook of Beaupré and the report of Krantz, and numerous monographs, has\r\nbrought to light valuable papers of soldiers who had returned and had\r\nleft their remembrances of life of the soldiers during the Russian\r\ncampaign to their descendants and relatives who had kept these papers a\r\nsacred inheritance during one hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe picture in the foreground of all histories of the Russian campaign\r\nis the shadow of the great warrior who led the troops, in whose\r\ninvincibility all men who followed him Anno 1812 believed and by whom\r\nthey stood in their soldier’s honor, with a constancy without equal, a\r\nsteadfastness which merits our admiration.\r\n\r\nThree fourths of the whole army belonged to nations whose real\r\ninterests were in direct opposition to the war against Russia.\r\nNotwithstanding that many were aware of this fact, they fought as brave\r\nin battle as if their own highest interests were at stake. All wanted\r\nto uphold their own honor as men and the honor of their nations. And no\r\nmatter how the individual soldier was thinking of Napoleon, whether he\r\nloved or hated him, there was not a single one in the whole army who\r\ndid not have implicit confidence in his talent. Wherever the Emperor\r\nshowed himself the soldiers believed in victory, where he appeared\r\nthousands of men shouted from the depth of their heart and with all the\r\npower of their voices Vive l’Empereur!\r\n\r\nA wild martial spirit reigned in all lands, the bloody sword did not\r\nask why and against whom it was drawn. To win glory for the own army,\r\nthe own colors and standards was the parole of the day. All the masses\r\nof different nations felt as belonging to one great whole and were\r\ndetermined to act as such.\r\n\r\nAnd all this has to be considered in a medical history of the campaign\r\nAnno 1812.\r\n\r\nThroughout Germany, Napoleon is the favorite hero. In the homes of the\r\ncommon people, in the huts of the peasants, there are pictures\r\nornamenting the walls, engravings which have turned yellow from age,\r\nthe frames of which are worm eaten. These pictures represent a variety\r\nof subjects, but rarely are there pictures missing of scenes of the\r\nlife of Napoleon. Generally they are divided into fields, and in the\r\nlarger middle field you see the hero of small stature, on a white\r\nhorse, from his fallow face the cold calculating eyes looking into a\r\nthrong of bayonets, lances, bearskin caps, helmets, and proud eagles.\r\nThe graceful mouth, in contrast to the strong projecting chin, modifies\r\nsomewhat the severity of this face, a face of marble of which it has\r\nbeen said that it gave the impression of a field of death, and the man\r\nwith this face is accustomed to conquer, to reign, to destroy. He is\r\nthe inexorable God of war himself, not in glittering armour, but in a\r\nplain uniform ornamented with one single order for personal bravery.\r\nThe tuft of hair on his high and broad forehead is like a sign of\r\neverlasting scorn. A gloomy, dreadfully attractive figure. In some of\r\nthe pictures we see him in his plain gray overcoat and well-known hat,\r\nsurrounded by marshals in splendid dress parade, forming a contrast to\r\nthe simplicity of their master, on some elevation from which he looks\r\ninto burning cities; again we see him unmoved by dreadful surroundings,\r\nriding through battle scenes of horror.\r\n\r\nOver my desk hangs such an old steel engraving, given to me by an old\r\nGerman lady who told me that her father had thought a great deal of it.\r\nOn Saturdays he would wash the glass over the other pictures with\r\nwater, but for washing the Napoleon picture he would use alcohol.\r\n\r\nBefore this man kings have trembled, innumerable thousands have\r\ncheerfully given their blood, their lives; this man has been adored\r\nlike a God and cursed like a devil. He has been the fate of the world\r\nuntil his hour struck. Many say providence had selected him to\r\ncastigate the universe and its enslaved peoples. A great German\r\nhistorian, Gervinus, has said: “He was the greatest benefactor of\r\nGermany who removed the gloriole from the heads crowned by the grace of\r\nGod.” He accomplished great things because he had great power, he\r\ncommitted great faults because he was so powerful. Without his\r\nunrestricted power he could not have accomplished one nor committed the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHistory is logic. Whenever great wrongs prevail, some mighty men appear\r\nand arouse the people, and these extraordinary men are like the storm\r\nin winter which shatters and breaks what is rotten, preparing for\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe German school boy, when he learns of the greatest warriors and\r\nconquerors, of Alexander the Great, of Julius Caesar, is most\r\nfascinated when he hears the history of the greatest of all the\r\nwarriors of the world, the history of Napoleon, and he is spellbound\r\nreading the awfully beautiful histories concerning his unheard of\r\ndeeds, his rise without example, and his sudden downfall.\r\n\r\nAnd he, the great man, the soldier-emperor, he rides on his white horse\r\nin the boy’s dreams, just as depicted on the engravings upon which the\r\nboys look with a kind of holy awe.\r\n\r\nThe son of a Corsican lawyer, becoming in early manhood the master of\r\nthe world, what could inflame youthful fiction more than this wonderful\r\ncareer?\r\n\r\nAll great conquerors come to a barrier. Alexander, when he planned to\r\nsubdue India, found the barrier at the Indus. Caesar found it at the\r\nThames and at the Rhine. Our hero’s fate was to be fulfilled at Moscow.\r\nHis insatiable thirst to rule had led him into Russia. He stood at the\r\nheight of his power and glory. Holland, Italy, a part of Germany, were\r\nFrench, and Germany especially groaned under the heel of severe\r\nxenocraty. The old German Empire had broken down, nothing of it was\r\nleft but a ridiculous name, “_Römisches Reich deutscher Nation_.” The\r\ncrowned heads of Germany held their thrones merely by the grace of\r\nNapoleon. Only Spain, united with England, dared him yet. Since\r\nNapoleon could not attack the English directly, on account of their\r\npower at sea, he tried to hit them where they were most sensitive, at\r\ntheir pocket. He instituted the continental blocus. Russia with the\r\nother lands of Continental Europe had to close her ports and markets\r\nagainst England, but Russia soon became tired of this pressure and\r\npreferred a new war with Napoleon to French domination.\r\n\r\nIn giving this sketch of the popularity of Napoleon’s memory in\r\nGermany, I have availed myself of a German calendar for the year 1913,\r\ncalled Der Lahrer hinkende Bote.\r\n\r\nExcept the English translation of Beaupré’s book I have taken from\r\nFrench and German writings only.\r\n\r\nI desire to thank Mr. S. Simonis, of New York, who has revised the\r\nentire manuscript and read the proofs; next to him I am under\r\nobligations to Reichs Archiv Rat Dr. Striedinger, of Munich, and Mr.\r\nFranz Herrmann, of New York, who have loaned me most valuable books and\r\npointed out important literature, and finally to Miss F. de Cerkez, who\r\nhas aided me in the translation of some of the chapters.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\nTransportation of Cannon under Difficulties\r\nAttack of Cossacks\r\n“And Never Saw Daylight Again,”\r\nBeresina\r\nGate of Wilna\r\nIn the Streets of Wilna\r\nRetreat Across the Niemen\r\n“No Fear, We Shall Soon Follow You”\r\nIn Prison\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSSING THE NIEMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 10th., 1812, the Moniteur published the following note: “The\r\nemperor has left to-day to inspect the Grand Army united at the\r\nVistula.” In France, in all parts of the Empire, the lassitude was\r\nextreme and the misery increasing, there was no commerce, with dearth\r\npronounced in twenty provinces, sedition of the hungry had broken out\r\nin Normandy, the gendarmes pursuing the “refractories” everywhere, and\r\nblood was shed in all thirty departments.\r\n\r\nThere was the complaint of exhausted population, and loudest was the\r\ncomplaint of mothers whose sons had been killed in the war.\r\n\r\nNapoleon was aware of these evils and understood well their gravity,\r\nbut he counted on his usual remedy, new victories; saying to himself\r\nthat a great blow dealt in the north, throwing Russia and indirectly\r\nEngland at his feet, would again be the salvation of the situation.\r\n\r\nCaulaincourt, his ambassador to the Tzar, had told him in several\r\nconversations, one of which had lasted seven hours, that he would find\r\nmore terrible disaster in Russia than in Spain, that his army would be\r\ndestroyed in the vastness of the country by the iron climate, that the\r\nTzar would retire to the farthest Asiatic provinces rather than accept\r\na dishonorable peace, that the Russians would retreat but never cede.\r\n\r\nNapoleon listened attentively to these prophetic words, showing\r\nsurprise and emotion; then he fell into a profound reflection, but at\r\nthe end of his revery, having enumerated once more his armies, all his\r\npeople, he said: “Bah! a good battle will bring to reason the good\r\ndetermination of your friend Alexander.”\r\n\r\nAnd in his entourage there were many who shared his optimism. The\r\nbrilliant youth of that new aristocracy which had begun to fill his\r\nstaff was anxious to equal the old soldiers of the revolution, the\r\nplebeian heroes.\r\n\r\nThey prepared for war in a luxurious way and ordered sumptuous outfits\r\nand equipages which later on encumbered the roads of Germany, just as\r\nthe carriages of the Prussian army had done in 1806.\r\n\r\nThese French officers spoke of the Russian campaign as a six months’\r\nhunting party.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had calculated not to occupy the country between the Vistula\r\nand the Niemen before the end of May, when the late spring of those\r\nregions would have covered the fields with green, so that the 100\r\nthousand horses marching with the army could find feed.\r\n\r\nHe traversed Germany between a double lane of kings, and princes bowed\r\nin an attitude of adoration.\r\n\r\nHe found them at Mainz, at Wuerzburg, at Bamberg, and his advance might\r\nbe compared to the royal progress of an Asiatic potentate.\r\n\r\nWhole populations were turned out to salute him, and during the night\r\nthe route over which the imperial carriages passed was illuminated by\r\nlighted piles of wood—an extensive line of fire in his honor.\r\n\r\nAt Dresden he had the attendance of an emperor (that of Austria) and of\r\nkings and reigning princes, who were present at his levees, together\r\nwith their prime ministers (the better to catch, to report, the words\r\nhe said, however insignificant) while high German dignitaries waited on\r\nhim at the table.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and the Empress of Austria had come at their own desire to\r\nsalute their daughter and their son-in-law and to present their good\r\nwishes for the success of the great expedition.\r\n\r\nTwelve days in succession he had at dinner the Emperor and Empress of\r\nAustria, the King and Queen of Saxony, the Saxon princes, the Prince\r\nPrimate of the Confederation of the Rhine—even the King of Prussia was\r\npresent; he offered his son for adjutant, which offer, however,\r\nNapoleon was tactful enough not to accept.\r\n\r\nAll the kings and reigning princes from the other States of Germany\r\npresented their best wishes and pledged faithfulness to Napoleon in his\r\nwar against Russia.\r\n\r\nAround the French emperor and empress at Dresden there was a court the\r\nlike of which Europe had never seen and never will see again.\r\n\r\nA Te Deum was sung to thank heaven for his arrival; there was a\r\nmagnificent display of fireworks, but the climax of all was a great\r\nconcert with an apotheosis showing, as the principal figure, the sun\r\nwith the inscription: “Less great and less beautiful than He.” “It\r\nappears that these people take me for very stupid,” said Napoleon to\r\nthis, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\nIn speaking to one of his intimates he called the King of Prussia a\r\nsergeant instructor, _une bête_, but openly he treated him with great\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\nHe made rich presents: gold and enameled boxes, jewelry and portraits\r\nof himself enriched with costly stones. During the happy days of\r\nDresden he enjoyed for once an intimate family life.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion he held a long conversation with his father-in-law,\r\nduring which he developed his plans of the Russian campaign, with\r\nminute and endless military details of which the emperor of Austria,\r\nbeing no strategist at all, understood nothing and said afterward: “My\r\nson-in-law is alright here,” pointing to the heart, “but here”—pointing\r\nto the forehead—he made a significant gesture.\r\n\r\nThis criticism of Napoleon by the Emperor of Austria became popular and\r\nhas been accepted by many writers. All reproaches about Cesarian\r\ninsanity which were cast at the great man and his whole life date from\r\nthat time. Some have said that he wanted to conquer England and Russia\r\nbecause these two he considered the arch enemies of Europe, that he\r\nforesaw the threatening growth of these two countries as dangerous, and\r\nif he did not take advantage of the good opportunity the future of\r\nEurope would be at the mercy of Russia and England.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Russia was the keynote of his universal policy.\r\n\r\nThe much calumniated blocus, say other writers, would finally have been\r\nthe greatest blessing for continental Europe; its aim had already been\r\nattained in so far as many London houses failed, and famine reigned on\r\nthe British islands in consequence of the high cost of living.\r\n\r\nAnd these writers say Napoleon had by no means become insane, but, on\r\nthe contrary, frightfully clear. Another explanation given was that he\r\nworried about his dynasty, his child, entertaining fear that his empire\r\nmight fall to pieces after his death, like the empire of Charles the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was enjoying good health, he had been warned by his\r\nphysician, _Corvisart_, of cancer of the stomach, from which Napoleon’s\r\nfather had died. Some suspicious black specks had been observed in the\r\nvomit. Therefore no time was to be lost, all had to be done in haste.\r\n\r\nThe rupture originated with Russia, for at the end of the year 1810 the\r\nTzar annulled the blocus and even excluded French goods or placed an\r\ninordinate duty on them—this was, in fact, a declaration of war. Russia\r\nwanted war while the Spanish campaign was taxing France’s military\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nThe only reliable report of Napoleon’s communications at St. Helena has\r\nbeen given by General de Gourgaudin the diary which he kept while with\r\nthe Emperor from 1815 to 1818, and which has been published in the year\r\n1898. Here is what Napoleon said on this subject:\r\n\r\nOn June 13th., 1816, he remarked in conversation with _Gourgaud_, “I\r\ndid not want the war with Russia, but _Kurakin_ presented me a\r\nthreatening note on account of _Davout’s_ troops at Hamburg. _Bassano_\r\nand _Champagny_ were mediocre ministers, they did not comprehend the\r\nintention which had dictated that note. I myself could not argue with\r\n_Kurakin_. They persuaded me that it meant declaration of war. Russia\r\nhad taken off several divisions from Moldavia and would take the\r\ninitiative with an attack on Warsaw. _Kurakin_ threatened and asked for\r\nhis passports. I myself believed finally they wanted war. I mobilized!\r\nI sent _Lauriston_ to Alexander, but he was not even received. From\r\nDresden I sent _Narbonne_, everything convinced me that Russia wanted\r\nwar. I crossed the Niemen near Wilna.\r\n\r\n“Alexander sent a General to me to assure me that he did not wish war;\r\nI treated this ambassador very well, he dined with me, but I believed\r\nhis mission was a trick to prevent the cutting off of _Bagratian_. I\r\ntherefore continued the march.\r\n\r\n“I did not wish to declare war against Russia, but I had the impression\r\nthat Russia wanted to break with me. I knew very well the difficulties\r\nof such a campaign.”\r\n\r\n_Gourgaud_ wrote in his diary a conversation which he had with\r\nMontholon on July 9th., 1817. “What was the real motive of the Russian\r\ncampaign? I know nothing about it, and perhaps the Emperor himself did\r\nnot know it. Did he intend to go to India after having dethroned the\r\nMoscowitic dynasty? The preparations, the tents which he took along,\r\nseem to suggest this assumption.”\r\n\r\nMontholon answered: “According to the instructions which I, as\r\nambassador, received I believe that His Majesty wanted to become\r\nEmperor of Germany, that he aimed to be crowned as ‘_Emperor of the\r\nWest_’. The Rhenish Confederation was made to understand this idea. In\r\nErfurt it was already a foregone conclusion, but Alexander demanded\r\nConstantinople, and this Napoleon would not concede.”\r\n\r\nAt another conversation Napoleon admitted “I have been too hasty. I\r\nshould have remained a whole year at the Niemen and in Prussia, in\r\norder to give my troops the much needed rest, to reorganize the army\r\nand also to eat up Prussia.”\r\n\r\nAll these details, Napoleon’s admission included, show that nobody knew\r\nand nobody knows why this gigantic expedition was undertaken. Certain\r\nis, however, that England had a hand in the break between Napoleon and\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon called on the generals to lead them into this expedition\r\nthey all had become settled to some extent, some in Paris, others on\r\ntheir possessions or as governors and commanders all over Europe, which\r\nat that time meant France; in consequence there existed a certain\r\ndispleasure among these officers, especially among the older ones and\r\nthose of high rank.\r\n\r\nThe high positions which he had created for them and the rich incomes\r\nwhich they enjoyed had developed their and their wives’ taste for a\r\nluxurious and brilliant mode of living. Besides, most of them, as well\r\nas their master, had attained the age between forty and fifty, their\r\nambition gradually had relented, they had enough; and the family with\r\nwhich they had been together for very brief periods only between two\r\ncampaigns, clung to them now and held them tightly.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these conditions, they all came when the Emperor\r\ncalled; after they had shaken off wife and children and had mounted in\r\nthe saddle, while the old veterans and the young impatient soldiers\r\nwere jubilant around them, they regained their good humor and went on\r\nto new victories, the brave men they always had been.\r\n\r\nEspecially at first when, at the head of their magnificent regiments,\r\nthey marched eastward through the conquered lands, from city to city,\r\nfrom castle to castle, like masters of the world, when in Dresden they\r\nmet their comrades in war and their friends, and when they saw how all\r\nthe crowned heads of Europe bowed before their Emperor, then the Grand\r\nArmy was in its glory.\r\n\r\nAs we know from history the Grand Army had contingents from twenty\r\nnationalities: Frenchmen, Germans, Italians, Austrians, Swiss,\r\nSpaniards, Portuguese, Poles, Illyrians, etc., and numbered over half a\r\nmillion men, with 100 thousand horses, 1,000 cannon.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bleibtreu (Die grosse Armee, Stuttgart, 1908), and\r\nKielland (Rings um Napoleon, Leipzig, 1907) the Grand Army was made up\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n_First Corps_—Davout, six divisions of the best troops under the\r\ncommand of Morand, Friant, Gudin. In this corps were, besides French,\r\nBadensian, Dutch, and Polish regiments. Davout commanded also 17\r\nthousand Prussian soldiers under General Grawert. Among the generals\r\nwere Compans and Pajol, the engineer Haxo, and the handsome General\r\nFriederich 67,000\r\n\r\n_Second Corps_—Oudinot with the divisions of Generals Merle, Legrand,\r\nMaison, Lannes’ and Massena’s veterans 40,000\r\n\r\n_Third Corps_—Ney with two divisions of veterans of Lannes; to this\r\ncorps belonged the Wuerttembergians who had served under Ney before\r\n49,000\r\n\r\n_Fourth Corps_—Prince Eugene with Junot as second commander, and the\r\nGenerals Grouchy, Broussier, the two brothers Delzon. In this corps\r\nwere the best soldiers of the Italian army 45,000\r\n\r\n_Fifth Corps_—Prince Poniatowski. Soldiers of all arms, mostly Poles\r\n26,000 Sixth Corps—General St Cyr. Mostly foreigners who had served in\r\nthe French army since 1809 25,000\r\n\r\n_The Sixth Corps_—General St Cyr. Mostly foreigners who had served in\r\nthe French army since 1809 25,000\r\n\r\n_The Seventh Corps_—General Reynier. Mostly Saxons and Poles 17,000\r\n\r\n_The Eighth Corps_—King Jerome. Westphalians and Hessians 18,000\r\n\r\nBesides, there were four corps of reserve cavalry distributed among the\r\ncorps of Davout, Oudinot, and Ney; the rest, excellent horsemen,\r\nmarched with the Imperial Guard 15,000\r\n\r\n_The Imperial Guards_ were commanded by the Marshals Mortier and\r\nLefebvre and were divided into two corps, the old guard and the young\r\nguard 47,000\r\n\r\nThere was the engineer park, composed of sappers, miners, pontooneers\r\nand military mechanicians of all descriptions, the artillery park, and\r\ntrain of wagons with attendants and horses. To these two trains alone\r\nbelonged 18 thousand horses.\r\n\r\nIn the active army which marched toward Russia there were 423 thousand\r\nwell drilled soldiers; namely, 300 thousand infantry, 70 thousand\r\ncavalry and 30 thousand artillery with 1 thousand cannon, 6 pontoon\r\ntrains, ambulances, and also provisions for one month.\r\n\r\nAs reserve, the ninth corps—Marshal Victor—and the tenth\r\ncorps—Augereau—were stationed near Magdeburg, ready to complete the\r\narmy gradually.\r\n\r\nThe whole army which marched to Russia consisted of 620 thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe question of subsistence for this immense body occupied Napoleon\r\nchiefly. He felt the extraordinary difficulty and great danger, he knew\r\nthat at the moment of coming in contact with the enemy all the corps\r\nwould be out of supplies in twenty or twenty-five days if there were no\r\ngreat reserves of bread, biscuit, rice, etc., closely following the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nHis system was that of requisition. To secure the needed supplies the\r\ncommanders of the corps were ordered to seize in the country all the\r\ngrain which could be found and at once to convert it into flour, with\r\nmethodic activity.\r\n\r\nNapoleon himself superintended and hastened the work. At twenty\r\ndifferent places along the Vistula he had the grinding done\r\nunceasingly, distributing the flour thus obtained among the corps and\r\nexpediting its transport by every possible means. He even invented new\r\nmeasures for this purpose, among which the well-known formation of\r\nbattalions of cattle, an immense rolling stock destined to follow the\r\ncolumns to serve twofold: for transportation of provisions, and finally\r\nas food.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of June these supreme preparations had been made or\r\nseemed to have been made. In the lands through which the troops were to\r\nmarch before they reached the Niemen, the spring had done its work;\r\nthere was abundance of forage.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had impatiently awaited this time during ten months of secret\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nIt was the hope of Russia and the fear of those Frenchmen who\r\nunderstood the Russian climate that the campaign would drag into the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nRussians already told of the village blacksmith who laughed when he was\r\nshown a French horseshoe which had been found on the road, and said:\r\n“Not one of these horses will leave Russia if the army remains till\r\nfrost sets in!” The French horseshoes had neither pins nor barbed\r\nhooks, and it would be impossible for horses thus shod to draw cannons\r\nand heavy wagons up and down hill over frozen and slippery roads.\r\n\r\nThe annihilation of the Grand Army is not to be attributed to the cold\r\nand the fearful conditions on the retreat from Moscow alone, the army\r\nwas in reality annihilated before it reached Russia, as we shall see by\r\nthe following description which I have taken from a Latin dissertation\r\n(translated also into German) of the surgeon of a Wuerttembergian\r\nregiment, Ch. Io. von Scherer, who had served through the whole\r\ncampaign and in the year 1820 had submitted this dissertation,\r\n“Historia Morborum, qui in Expeditione Contra Russiam Anno 1812 Facta\r\nLegiones Wuerttembergicas invaserunt, praesertim eorum qui frigore orti\r\nsunt,” to the Medical Faculty, presided over by F. G. Gmelin, to obtain\r\nthe degree of doctor of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe diseases which befell the soldiers in Russia extended over the\r\nwhole army. Von Scherer, however, gives his own observations only,\r\nwhich he had made while serving in the Wuerttembergian corps of\r\nfourteen to fifteen thousand men.\r\n\r\nThe expedition into Russia in the year 1812 was divided into ten\r\ndivisions, each of these numbering fifty to sixty thousand men, all\r\nhealthy, robust, most of them hardened in war. The Wuerttembergians\r\nwere commanded by General Count von Scheeler and the French General\r\nMarchand; the highest commander was Marshal Ney.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of May, 1812, the great army of Napoleon arrived at\r\nthe frontier of Poland, whence it proceeded by forced and most tiresome\r\nmarches to the river Niemen, which forms the boundary between Lithuania\r\nand Poland, arriving at the borders of the river in the middle of June.\r\n\r\nAn immense body of soldiers (500,000) met near the city of Kowno,\r\ncrossed the Niemen on pontoons, and formed, under the eyes of the\r\nEmperor, in endless battle line on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe forced march continued day and night over the sandy soil of Poland.\r\nThe tropical heat during the day and the low temperature at night, the\r\nfrequent rainstorms from the north, the camping on bare and often wet\r\nground, the ever increasing want of pure water and fresh provisions,\r\nthe immense masses of dust, which, cloudlike, hung over the marching\r\ncolumns—all these difficulties put together had sapped the strength of\r\nthe soldiers already at the beginning of the campaign. Many were taken\r\nsick before they reached the Niemen.\r\n\r\nThe march through Lithuania was hastened as much as the march through\r\nPoland. Provisions became scarcer all the time, meat from cattle that\r\nhad suffered from starvation and exhaustion was for a long time the\r\nsoldiers’ only food. The great heat, and the inhalation of sand and\r\ndust, dried the tissues of the body, and the thirsty soldiers longed in\r\nvain for a drink of water. Often there was no other opportunity to\r\nquench the thirst than the water afforded by the swamps. The officers\r\nwere powerless to prevent the soldiers from kneeling down at stagnant\r\npools and drinking the foul water without stint.\r\n\r\nThus the army, tired to the utmost from overexertion and privation, and\r\ndisposed to sickness, entered the land of the enemy. The forced marches\r\nwere continued during the day, through sand and dust, until stormy\r\nweather set in with rain, followed by cold winds.\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of bad weather, dysentery, which had already been\r\nobserved at the time of the crossing of the Niemen, showed itself with\r\ngreater severity. The route the army had taken from camp to camp was\r\nmarked by offensive evacuations. The number of the sick became so great\r\nthat they could not all be attended to, and medical treatment became\r\nillusory when the supply of medicaments was exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the army fought in vain, however courageously,\r\nagainst the extending evil. As everything was wanting of which the sick\r\nwere in need, there was no barrier against the spread of the disease,\r\nwhile at the same time the privations and hardships which had caused it\r\ncontinued and reached their climax.\r\n\r\nSome of these soldiers would march, equipped with knapsack and arms,\r\napparently in good spirits, but suddenly would succumb and die. Others,\r\nespecially those of strong constitution, would become melancholy and\r\ncommit suicide. The number of deaths increased from day to day.\r\n\r\nMarvelous was the effect of emotion on the disease. Surgeon-General von\r\nKohlreuter, during and after the battle of Smolensk, witnessed this\r\ninfluence. Of four thousand Wuerttembergians who took part in that\r\nbattle, there were few quite free from dysentery.\r\n\r\nTired and depressed, the army dragged along; but as soon as the\r\nsoldiers heard the cannon in the distance, telling them the battle was\r\nbeginning, they emerged at once from their lethargy; the expression of\r\ntheir faces, which had been one of sadness, changed to one of joy and\r\nhilarity. Joyfully and with great bravery they went into action. During\r\nthe four days that the battle lasted, and for some days afterward,\r\ndysentery disappeared as if banished by magic. When the battle was over\r\nand the privations were the same again as they had been, the disease\r\nreturned with the same severity as before—nay, even worse, and the\r\nsoldiers fell into complete lethargy.\r\n\r\nThe necropsy of those who had died from dysentery revealed derangement\r\nof the digestive organs; the stomach, the large intestine, mostly the\r\nrectum, were inflamed; the intima of stomach and duodenum, sometime the\r\nwhole intestine, were atonic. In some cases there were small ulcers,\r\nwith jagged margins, in the stomach, especially in its fundus, and in\r\nthe rectum; in other cases dysentery had proceeded to such an extent\r\nthat pretty large ulcers had developed, extending from the stomach into\r\nthe small and from there into the large intestine, into the rectum.\r\nThese ulcers were of sizes varying from that of a lentil to the size of\r\na walnut. Where the disease had been progressive the intima, the mucosa\r\nand submucosa—very seldom, however, the serosa—were perforated by\r\nulcers; in many cases there were gangraenous patches in the fundus of\r\nthe stomach and along the intestinal tract. The gastric juice smelled\r\nhighly acid, frequently the liver was discolored and contained a bluish\r\nliquid, its lower part in most cases hardened and bluish; the gall\r\nbladder, as a rule, was empty or contained only a small amount of bile;\r\nthe mesenteric glands were mostly inflamed, sometimes purulent; the\r\nmesenteric and visceral vessels appeared often as if studded with\r\nblood. Such patients had suffered sometimes from gastralgy, had had a\r\ngreat craving for food, especially vegetables, but were during that\r\ntime entirely free from fever.\r\n\r\nRemarkably sudden disaster followed the immoderate use of alcohol. Some\r\nWuerttembergian soldiers, who during the first days of July had been\r\nsent on requisition, had discovered large quantities of brandy in a\r\nnobleman’s mansion, and had indulged in its immoderate use and died,\r\nlike all dysentery patients who took too much alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe number of Wuerttembergians afflicted with dysentery, while on the\r\nmarch from the Niemen to the Dwina, amounted to three thousand, at\r\nleast this many were left behind in the hospitals of Malaty, Wilna,\r\nDisna, Strizzowan and Witepsk. The number of deaths in the hospitals\r\nincreased as the disease proceeded, from day to day, and the number of\r\nthose who died on the march was not small. Exact hospital statistics\r\ncannot be given except of Strizzowan, which was the only hospital from\r\nwhich lists had been preserved; and here von Scherer did duty during\r\nsix weeks. Out of 902 patients 301 died during the first three weeks;\r\nduring the other three weeks when the patients had better care only 36\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nIn the hospitals established on the march, in haste, in poor villages,\r\nmedicaments were either wanting entirely or could be had only in\r\ninsufficient quantity. All medical plants which grew on the soil in\r\nthat climate were utilized by the surgeons, as, for instance in the\r\nhospital of Witepsk, huckleberries and the root of tormentilla.\r\nEstablishing the hospital in Strizzowan von Scherer placed some of his\r\npatients in the castle, others in a barn and the rest in stables. Not\r\nwithout great difficulties and under dangers he procured provisions\r\nfrom the neighborhood. As medicaments he used, and sometimes with\r\nreally good results, the following plants which were found in abundance\r\nin the vicinity: 1. Cochlearia armoracia; 2. Acorus calamus; 3. Allium\r\nsativum; 4. Raphanus sativus; 5. Menyanthes trifoliata; 6. Salvia\r\nofficinalis.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the following three weeks General Count von Scheeler\r\nhanded him several thousand florins to be used for the alleviation of\r\nthe sufferings of the soldiers under his care, and von Scherer procured\r\nfrom great distances, namely, from the Polish cities Mohilew, Minsk and\r\nWilna, suitable medicines and provisions. The proper diet which could\r\nnow be secured, together with best medicines, had an excellent effect.\r\nThis is seen at a glance when perusing the statistics of the first\r\nthree and the last three weeks. In some cases in which the patients had\r\nbeen on the way to recovery, insignificant causes would bring relapse.\r\nPotatoes grew in abundance in the vicinity of the hospital, and\r\npatients would clandestinely help themselves and eat them in excessive\r\nquantities, with fatal result.\r\n\r\nIn some the intestinal tract remained very weak for a long time.\r\nEmaciation of the convalescents improved only very slowly. Remarkable\r\nwas a certain mental depression or indolence which remained in many\r\npatients. Even in officers who von Scherer had known as energetic and\r\ngood-humored men there was seen for a long time a morose condition and\r\nvery noticeable dulness. Whatever they undertook was done slowly and\r\nimperfectly. Sometimes, even with a kind of wickedness, they showed an\r\ninclination to steal or do something forbidden. Sometimes it was\r\ndifficult to induce them to take exercise. Von Scherer, in order to\r\ncheer up the convalescents, ordered daily walks under guard, and this\r\nwas the more necessary as oedemata developed on the extremities in\r\nthose who remained motionless on their couches.\r\n\r\nHow injurious the immoderate use of alcoholic beverages proved to be\r\nwas demonstrated in three cases of convalescents, who were still\r\nsomewhat weak. They had secretly procured some bottles of brandy from\r\nthe cellar of the hospital, and with the idea of having a good time had\r\ndrunk all of it in one sitting. Very soon they had dangerous symptoms:\r\nabdominal pain, nausea and vomiting followed by lachrymation from the\r\nprotruding and inflamed eyes. They fell down senseless, had liquid and\r\nhighly offensive evacuations and died, in spite of all medical aid, in\r\nsix hours. On the abdomen, the neck, the chest and especially on the\r\nfeet of the corpses of these men there were gangraenous spots of\r\ndifferent sizes, a plain proof that the acute inflammation, gangraene\r\nand putrefaction had been caused by the excessive irritation of the\r\nextremely weak body. Circumstances forbade necropsy in these cases.\r\n\r\nAmong different publications on the medical history of Napoleon’s\r\ncampaign in 1812, which I happened to find, was a dissertation of Marin\r\nBunoust, “Considerations générales sur la congelation pendant l’ivresse\r\nobservée en Russie en 1812.” Paris, 1817 (published, therefore, three\r\nyears before publication of von Scherer’s dissertation), in which the\r\nauthor wishes to show that the physiological effect of drunkenness on\r\nthe organism is identical with that of extreme cold.\r\n\r\nVon Scherer, after the hospital of Strizzowan had been evacuated, again\r\njoined his regiment. The French army in forced marches pursued the\r\nenemy on the road to Moscow over Ostrowno, Witepsk and Smolensk.\r\nDysentery did not abate. In the hospitals of Smolensk, Wiasma and\r\nGhiat, von Scherer found, besides the wounded from the battles of\r\nKrasnoe, Smolensk and Borodino, a great number of dysentery patients;\r\nmany died on the march. The whole presented a pitiful sight, and the\r\nsoldiers’ contempt of life excited horror.\r\n\r\nWe shall return to von Scherer’s dissertation when describing the\r\nretreat from Moscow.\r\n\r\nWhile the dissertation of von Scherer treats on the fate of the\r\nWuerttembergian corps of Napoleon’s grand army, a memoir of First\r\nLieutenant von Borcke who served as adjutant of General von Ochs in the\r\nWestphalian corps relates the fate of the Westphalians in the grand\r\narmy of 1812.\r\n\r\nThe Westphalians, 23,747 men strong, left Cassel in the month of March,\r\n1812, to unite with the French army. One of the regiments was sent\r\nlater and joined the corps while the army was on the retreat from\r\nMoscow at Moshaisk. This regiment, like another, which followed still\r\nlater and joined the army on the retreat at Wilna, was annihilated. Of\r\nthe 23,747 men a few hundred finally returned. On March 24th., the\r\nWestphalians crossed the Elbe, von Borcke (it is a common error in\r\nAmerican literature to spell the predicate of nobility _von_ with a\r\ncapital V when at the beginning of a period, while neither von nor the\r\ncorresponding French de as predicate of nobility should ever be spelled\r\nwith a capital) at that time suffered from intermittent fever, but was\r\ncured by the use of calisaya bark. I mention this to call attention to\r\nthe fact that quinine was not known in the year 1812. When the corps\r\nmarched into Poland the abundance of provisions which the soldiers had\r\nenjoyed, came to an end.\r\n\r\nThere were no magazines from which rations could have been distributed,\r\nand the poor Polish peasants, upon whom requisitions should have been\r\nmade, had nothing for the soldiers. Disorder among the troops who thus\r\nfar distinguished themselves by strictest discipline, made its\r\nappearance. How the army was harassed by the plague of dysentery, how\r\nthe soldiers were marching during great heat, insufficiently supplied\r\nin every way, and how they suffered from manifold hardships, has been\r\ndescribed in von Scherer’s dissertation. The Westphalian corps was in\r\nas precarious a condition as the Wuerttembergian, as in fact the whole\r\narmy and the Westphalian battalions were already reduced to one-half\r\ntheir former number. Many soldiers had remained behind on account of\r\nsickness or exhaustion, and officers were sent back to bring them to\r\nthe ranks again.\r\n\r\nThe whole army would have dissolved if the march had not been\r\ninterrupted. Napoleon ordered a stay. An order from him called for a\r\nrally of the troops, for the completion of war material, ammunition,\r\nand horses and provisions; but where to take all these things from? The\r\nwar had not yet begun, and the troops were already in danger of\r\nstarvation. Only with sadness and fear could the soldiers, under these\r\ncircumstances, look into the future.\r\n\r\nIn what way, says Ebstein, can this great want, this insufficient\r\nsupply of provisions, which made itself felt even at the beginning of\r\nthe campaign, be explained? It has been shown how Napoleon exerted\r\nhimself to meet the extraordinary difficulty of supplying the grand\r\narmy of half a million of men and 100,000 horses with provisions, how\r\nwell he was aware of the great danger in this regard, how he\r\nsuperintended and hastened the work of providing for men and horses by\r\nevery possible means, that he understood all the circumstances\r\nsurrounding the march of the grand army through a vast country\r\npopulated by few, and these mostly serfs who had barely sufficient food\r\nfor themselves and no means to replenish their stock in case it should\r\nhave been exhausted by Napoleon’s system of requisition, not to speak\r\nof the marauding to which the French soldiers were soon forced to\r\nresort. Ebstein says that the cause of the sad, the wretched condition\r\nconcerning supplies was due to the fact that incompetent officers had\r\nbeen appointed as commissaries of the army; they held high military\r\nrank, were independent and could not be easily reached for their\r\nfaults. It happened that soldiers were starving near well filled\r\nmagazines, such magazines at Kowno, Wilna, Minsk, Orcha being not only\r\nwell, but over, filled, while the passing troops were in dire need. We\r\nshall later on come to frightful details of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe miserable maintenance had from the beginning a demoralizing effect\r\non the men, manifested by desertion, insubordination, marauding,\r\nvandalism. General Sir Robert Wilson, British commissioner with the\r\nheadquarters of the Russian army, quoted by Ebstein, says: “The French\r\narmy, from its very entrance into the Russian territory (and this\r\ncannot be repeated too often to lend the proper weight to the\r\nconsequences resulting therefrom), notwithstanding order on order and\r\nsome exemplary punishments, had been incorrigibly guilty of every\r\nexcess. It had not only seized with violence all that its wants\r\ndemanded, but destroyed in mere wantonness what did not tempt its\r\ncupidity. No vandal ferocity was ever more destructive. Those crimes,\r\nhowever, were not committed with impunity. Want, sickness, and an\r\nenraged peasantry, inflicted terrible reprisals, and caused daily a\r\nfearful reduction of numbers.”\r\n\r\nBut this description of the Englishman will apply to every army in\r\nwhich there are such difficulties in obtaining the necessary supplies\r\nas they existed here on the forced marches.\r\n\r\nFurther, he does not speak of the severe punishments meted out to the\r\nculprits. By order of Napoleon entire squads of marauders were shot.\r\nVon Roos, chief physician of a Wuerttembergian regiment, has seen that\r\nbefore their execution they had to dig their own graves.\r\n\r\nIn Wilna already Davout ordered the execution of 70, and in Minsk of 13\r\nmarauders.\r\n\r\nA Westphalian officer, von Lossberg, commander of a battalion, wrote in\r\nhis letters to his wife—which are of great value to the history of the\r\ncampaign—from Toloschin on July 25: “On our march we met a detachment\r\nof Davout’s corps; they shot before our eyes a commissary of the army\r\nwho had been condemned to death for fraud. He had sold for 200 dollars\r\nprovisions which had been intended for the soldiers.”\r\n\r\nNapoleon had stayed several days at Thorn, inspecting the departing\r\ntroops, visiting the magazines, bestowing a last glance upon\r\neverything. Before the guards left their cantonments he wanted to see\r\nthe different corps and hold a great review. He loved to see again the\r\nmanly figures of the soldiers, their chests of iron, these braves who\r\nstood before him, immovable in parade, irresistible in fight. Their\r\nbearing and their expression gave him pleasure. Notwithstanding the\r\nfatigues and the privations of the march, enthusiasm shone on all the\r\nfaces, in the brightening of all the eyes. He wanted to give with his\r\nown mouth the order “forward march” to the regiments of the guard, and\r\nhe saw the endless defile of these proud uniforms, heard the\r\nuninterrupted beating of the drums, the sound of the trumpets, the\r\nacclamation “Vive l’Empereur” of the beautiful troops, the departure of\r\nthe officers, every one of whom had orders to set in motion or to halt\r\nhuman masses. All this great movement around him, by his will, at his\r\nword, animated and excited him. Now, the lot having irrevocably been\r\ncast, he surrenders himself completely to his instincts as warrior, he\r\nfeels himself only soldier, the greatest and most ardent who has\r\nexisted, he dreams of nothing but victories and conquests. At night,\r\nafter having given orders all day long, he slept only at intervals,\r\npassing part of the night walking up and down. One night those on duty,\r\nwho slept near his room, were surprised hearing him sing with plain\r\nvoice a popular song of the soldiers of the republic.\r\n\r\nOn June 6th., Napoleon left Thorn while all the army was marching. At\r\nDanzig he saw Murat, whom he had called directly from Naples. He did\r\nnot wish him near except for the fight where he would be an ornament in\r\nbattle and set a magnificent example. Otherwise he considered his\r\npresence useless and hurtful. He had taken special pains to keep him\r\naway from Dresden, from the assembly of sovereigns, from contact with\r\ndynasties of the _ancien régime_, especially of the house of Austria,\r\nbecause of his being a king of recent origin. He feared the\r\nindiscretion of the newly made kings when brought together with the\r\nsovereigns by the grace of God. He did not wish that any intimacy\r\nshould develop between them.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the two brothers-in-law was at first cold and painful.\r\nEach had a grievance against the other and did not restrain himself at\r\nall to pronounce it. Murat complained, as he had done before, that he,\r\nas King of Naples, was an instrument of domination and tyranny, and\r\nadded that he could find a way to extricate himself from such an\r\nintolerable exigency. Napoleon reproached Murat of his more and more\r\nmarked inclination to disobey, of his digression in language and\r\nconduct, and of his suspicious actions. He looked at him with a severe\r\nmien, spoke harsh words, and treated him altogether with severity. But\r\nthen, suddenly changing his tone, he spoke to him in a language of\r\nfriendship, of wounded and misunderstood friendship, became emotional,\r\ncomplained of ingratitude, and recalled the memory of their long\r\naffection, their military comradery. The king who was easily moved, was\r\nthinking of all the generosity he had enjoyed, and could not resist the\r\nappeal, he became emotional in his turn, almost shed tears, forgot all\r\ngrief for a while, and was conquered.\r\n\r\nAnd in the evening before his intimates the emperor lauded himself for\r\nhaving played excellent comedy to regain Murat, that he had by turns\r\nand very successfully enacted anger and sentimentality with this\r\nItalian _pantaleone_, but, added he, Murat has a good heart.\r\n\r\nAhead of the emperor, between Danzig and Koenigsberg, traversing East\r\nPrussia and some districts of Poland, marched the army—under what\r\ndifficulties has been described. At the same time, through the Baltic\r\nand the Frische Haff, came the more ponderous war material, the\r\npontoons and the heaviest artillery, the siege guns. To complete the\r\nsupply of provisions before entering upon the campaign the troops\r\nexhausted the land by making extensive requisitions. The emperor had\r\nwished that all should go on regularly and that everything taken from\r\nthe inhabitants should be paid for, but this the soldiers did not\r\nconsider. They took and emptied the granaries, tore down the straw from\r\nthe roofs of the peasants’ houses, barns, and stables to make litter\r\nfor their horses, and treated the inhabitants not as friends, but as if\r\nthey were people of a conquered land. The cavalry which passed first\r\nhelped themselves for their horses to all the hay and all the grass,\r\nthe artillery and the train were obliged to take from the fields the\r\ngreen barley and oats, and the army altogether ruined the population\r\nwhere it passed. The men obliged to disperse during a part of the day\r\nas foragers, got into the habit of disbanding and of looseness of\r\ndiscipline, and the impossibility manifested itself to keep in order\r\nand in ranks the multitude of different races, different in languages,\r\nwho with their many vehicles represented a regular migration.\r\n\r\nEverything became monotonous—the country, the absence of an enemy. They\r\nfound Prussia and especially Poland, ugly, dirty, miserable, all the\r\nhouses were full of dirt and vermin, domestic animals of all kinds were\r\nthe intimate syntrophoi of the peasants in their living rooms. The\r\nsoldiers bore badly the inconvenience of the lodging, the coolness of\r\nthe night following the burning heat of the day, the fogs in the\r\nmornings. But they consoled themselves with illusions, painting the\r\nfuture in rosy colors, hoping to find across the Niemen a better soil,\r\na different people, more favorable to the soldier, and longed for\r\nRussia as for the promised land.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Army had arrived at the Niemen. It was on June 24th., the sun\r\nrose radiant and lightened with his fire a magnificent scene. To the\r\ntroops was read a short and energetic proclamation. Napoleon came out\r\nof his tent, surrounded by his officers, and contemplated with his\r\nfield glass the sight of this prodigious force; hundreds of thousands\r\nof soldiers united in one place! One could not find anything comparable\r\nto the enthusiasm which the presence of Napoleon inspired on that day.\r\nThe right bank of the river was covered with these magnificent troops;\r\nthey descended from the heights and spread out in long files over the\r\nthree bridges, resembling three currents; the rays of the sun glittered\r\non the bayonets and helmets, and the cry _Vive l’Empereur_! was heard\r\nincessantly.\r\n\r\nIf I were to give a full description to do justice to the magnificent\r\nspectacle I would have to quote from the journals of that epoch, and if\r\nI were a painter I could not find a greater subject for my art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON TO MOSCOW\r\n\r\n\r\nArrived in Russia the French were soon disappointed; gloomy forests and\r\nsterile soil met the eye, all was sad and silent. After the army had\r\npassed the Niemen and entered into Poland the misery, instead of\r\ndiminishing, increased, the hour had struck for these unfortunates. The\r\nenemy destroyed everything on retreating, the cattle were taken to\r\ndistant provinces; the French saw the destruction of the fields, the\r\nvillages were deserted, the peasants fled upon the appearance of the\r\nFrench army, all inhabitants had left except the Jews. When the army\r\ncame to Lithuania everything seemed to be in league against the French.\r\nIt was a rainy season, the soldiers marched through vast and gloomy\r\nforests, and all was melancholy. One could have imagined himself to be\r\nin a desert if it had not been for the vehicles, the cursing of the\r\ndrivers, discontented on account of hunger and fatigue, the\r\nimprecations of the soldiers on every occasion; bad humor, due to\r\nprivations, prevailed everywhere. It would seem as if the furies of\r\nhell were marching at the heels of the army. The roads were in a\r\nterrible condition, almost unpassable on account of the rain which had\r\nbeen continuous since the crossing of the Niemen; the artillery wagons\r\nespecially gave great trouble in passing marshes, and, on account of\r\nthe extreme exhaustion of the horses, a great many of these vehicles\r\nhad to be abandoned. The horses receiving no nourishment but green\r\nherbs could resist even less than the men and they fell by the hundred.\r\n\r\nThe improper feeding of the animals caused gastric disturbances,\r\nalternately diarrhoea and constipation, enormous tympanitis,\r\nperitonitis. It is touching to read of the devotion of German\r\ncavalrymen to their poor horses. They would introduce the whole arm\r\ninto the bowel to relieve the suffering creatures of the accumulated\r\nfecal masses.\r\n\r\nAs the army advanced over these roads the extreme want of provisions\r\nwas bitterly felt. The warriors already reduced to such an excess of\r\nmisery were exposed to rain without being able to dry themselves; to\r\nnourish themselves they were forced to resort to the most horrible\r\nmarauding, and sometimes they had nothing to eat for twenty-four hours\r\nor even longer. They ran through the land in all directions,\r\ndisregarding all dangers, sometimes many miles away from the route, to\r\nfind provisions. Wherever they came they went through the houses from\r\nthe foundation to the roof, and when they found animals they took them\r\naway; no attention was paid to the feeling of the poor peasants and\r\nnothing was considered as being too harsh for them; in most instances\r\nthe latter had run away for fear of maltreatment. Nothing is so\r\nafflicting as to see the rapacity of pillaging soldiers, stealing and\r\ndestroying everything coming under their hands. They took to excess\r\nvodka found in the magazines which the enemy had not destroyed, or in\r\nthe castles off the main route. In consequence of this abuse of alcohol\r\nwhile in their feeble condition many perished. The enemy retreated\r\nbehind the Dwina and fortified himself in camp. It was thought that he\r\nwould give battle, and all enjoyed this prospect.\r\n\r\nOn July 20, at a time when the conditions of the army were already\r\nterrible, the heat became excessive. The rains ceased; there were no\r\nrainy days, except an occasional storm, until September 17. The poor\r\ninfantrymen were to be pitied; they had to carry their arms, their\r\neffects, their cartridges, harassed by continuous fatigue, overpowered\r\nby hunger and a thousand sorrows, and were obliged to march 10, 12, 15,\r\nand sometimes even 16 and 17 miles a day over dusty roads under a\r\nburning sun, all the time tormented by a cruel thirst. But all this has\r\nbeen fully described in an earlier chapter.\r\n\r\nOn July 23 the Prince of Eckmuehl (Davout) had a very hot engagement\r\nwith the Russian army corps under Prince _Bagratian_ before Mohilew; on\r\nJuly 25, a bloody battle was fought near Ostrowno. The houses and other\r\nbuildings of Ostrowno were filled with wounded, the battlefield covered\r\nwith corpses of men and horses, and the hot weather caused quick\r\nputrefaction. Kerckhove visited the battlefield on June 28 and says: “I\r\nhave no words to describe the horror of seeing the unburied cadavers,\r\ninfesting the air, and among the dead many helpless wounded without a\r\ndrop of water, exposed to the hot sun, crying in rage and despair.”\r\n\r\nNapoleon made preparations to attack on July 28, but the enemy had\r\nretreated. At Witepsk, hospitals were established for the wounded from\r\nOstrowno, among them 800 Russians. However, the designation “hospital”\r\nis hardly applicable, for everything was wanting; the patients in\r\ninfected air, crowded, and surrounded by uncleanliness, without food or\r\nmedicines. These hospitals were in reality death-houses. The physicians\r\ndid what they could. On August 18, the French army entered Smolensk\r\nwhich had been destroyed by projectiles and by fire; ruins filled with\r\nthe dead and dying; and in the midst of this desolation the\r\nterror-stricken inhabitants running everywhere, looking for members of\r\ntheir families—many of whom had been killed by bullets or by flames—or\r\nsitting before their still smoking homes, tearing their hair, a picture\r\nof distress truly heartrending. The soldiers who were the first to\r\nenter Smolensk found flour, brandy and wine, but these things were\r\ndevoured in an instant. There were 10 thousand wounded in the so-called\r\nhospitals, and among these unfortunates typhus and hospital gangraene\r\ndeveloped rapidly; the sick lying on the floor without even straw.\r\n\r\nHolzhausen gives the following description:\r\n\r\nAfter Smolensk had been evacuated by the Russians, most houses had been\r\nburnt out; the retreating Russians had destroyed everything that could\r\nbe of any use. Corpses everywhere. Nobody had time to remove them, and\r\nthe cannons, the freight wagons, the horses, and the infantry passed\r\nover them. On August 17th and 18th, was the battle of Polotsk in which\r\nthe Bavarians distinguished themselves. There were no medicines for the\r\nwounded, not even drinking water, no bread, no salt. Of the many\r\nunhealthy places in Russia this is the worst, it swarms with insects.\r\nNostalgia was prevailing. They had a so-called dying chamber in the\r\nhospital for which the soldiers were longing, to rest there on straw,\r\nnever to rise again.\r\n\r\nAwaiting their last the pious Bavarians repeated aloud their rosary,\r\ntook refuge with the Jesuits, who had a convent at Polotsk, to receive\r\nthe consolation of their religion.\r\n\r\nSome thought Napoleon would rest here to establish the Polish kingdom.\r\nBut this reasonable idea, if he had ever entertained it, he discarded.\r\nBy giving his troops winter quarters, establishing magazines and\r\nhospitals he would have succeeded in subduing Russia by reinforcing his\r\narmy; instead of all this he went on to Moscow without provisions,\r\nwithout magazines.\r\n\r\nOn August 30, the army reached Wiasma, a city of 8 thousand or 9\r\nthousand inhabitants which had been set on fire upon the approach of\r\nthe French. All the inhabitants had left. The soldiers fought the\r\nflames and saved some houses into which they brought those of their\r\nwounded and sick who could not drag themselves any farther. Cases of\r\ntyphus were numerous. From Wiasma the army marched to Ghiat, a city of\r\n6 thousand or 7 thousand inhabitants; at this place Napoleon gave a two\r\ndays’ rest in order that the army could rally, clean their arms and\r\nprepare for battle (the battle of Borodino on September 7. This battle\r\nis known under three names: the Russians have called it after the\r\nvillage of Borodino, of 200 inhabitants, near the battlefield and have\r\nnow erected a monument there, a collonade crowned with a cross; some\r\nhistorians have called it the battle of Moshaisk, after a nearby town\r\nof 4 thousand inhabitants, and Napoleon has named it the battle of the\r\nMoskwa, after a river near the battlefield.) Napoleon had only 120\r\nthousand to 130 thousand under arms, about as many as the Russians. It\r\nwas 6:30 a.m., a beautiful sunrise. Napoleon called it the sun of\r\nAusterlitz. The Russian generals made their soldiers say their prayers.\r\nA French cannon gave the signal to attack, and at once the French\r\nbatteries opened the battle with a discharge of more than 100 cannon.\r\nWriting this medical history of the Russian campaign I feel tempted to\r\ngive a description of this most frightful, most cruel of all battles in\r\nthe history of the world in which about 1,200 cannon without\r\ninterruption dealt destruction and death; fracas and tumult of arms of\r\nall kinds, the harangue, the shouts of the commanders, the cries of\r\nrage, the lamentations of the wounded, all blended into one terrible\r\ndin. Both armies charged with all the force that terror could develop.\r\nFrench and Russian soldiers not only fought like furious lions rivaling\r\neach other in ardor and courage, but they fought with wild joy, devoid\r\nof all human feeling, like maniacs; they threw themselves on the enemy\r\nwhere he was most numerous, in a manner which manifested the highest\r\ndegree of despair. The French had to gain the victory or succumb to\r\nmisery; victory or death was their only thought. The Russians felt\r\nthemselves humiliated by the approach of the French to their capital,\r\nand unshaken as a rock they resisted, defending themselves with grim\r\ndetermination. The battle, Napoleon promised, would be followed by\r\npeace and good winter quarters, but he was not as good a prophet as he\r\nwas a good general.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the Westphalian corps was reduced to 1500 men. Napoleon\r\nordered these to do guard-duty on the battlefield, transport the\r\nimmense number of wounded to the hospitals, bury the dead and to remain\r\nwhile the army marched and stayed at Moscow. What the Westphalians\r\ncould do for the wounded was very little, for everything was wanting.\r\nThe hospital system was incomplete, miserable. It is true, the surgeons\r\ndressed, operated, amputated, during the battle and during the days\r\nfollowing, a great many wounded, but their number and their assistance\r\nwas inadequate for the enormous task; thousands remained without proper\r\nattendance and died.\r\n\r\nAbout one thousand Wuerttembergians were wounded in the battle of\r\nBorodino, and on many of these surgical operations had to be performed.\r\nStrange to say, the greatest operations on enfeebled wounded were more\r\nsuccessful, a great many more were saved, than was generally the case\r\nunder more favorable circumstances. Thus Surgeon General von Kohlreuter\r\nobserved that in the Russian campaign amputation of an arm, for\r\ninstance, gave much better chances, more recoveries, than in the Saxon\r\nand French campaigns, during which latter the soldiers were still\r\nrobust, well nourished and well, even in abundance, supplied with\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nMeans of transportation were lacking, for no wagons could be found in\r\nthe deserted villages, and for this reason many whose wounds had been\r\ndressed had to be left to their fate—to die. Those but slightly wounded\r\nand those even who could crawl in some manner followed the troops, or\r\nwent back at random to find their death in some miserable hut. Many\r\nsought refuge in nearby villages, sometimes miles away from the\r\nbattle-field, there to fall into the hands of the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nThe Westphalians remained on the battle-field surrounded by corpses and\r\ndying men, and they were forced to change position from time to time on\r\naccount of the stench. The scenes of suffering and distress which the\r\nbattle-field presented everywhere surpassed all description; the groans\r\nof the mutilated and dying followed the men on guard even at a\r\ndistance, and especially was this terrible during the night; it filled\r\nthe heart with horror, von Borcke said that soldiers, at the request of\r\nsome of the wounded in extreme agony, shot them dead and turned the\r\nface away while shooting. And soon they considered this an act of pity.\r\nThe officers even induced them to look for those who could not be\r\nsaved, in order to relieve them from their suffering. When von Borcke\r\nwas riding on horseback over the battle-field on the 5th. day after the\r\nbattle he saw wounded soldiers lying alongside the cadaver of a horse,\r\ngnawing at its flesh. During the night flames could be seen here and\r\nthere on this field of death; these were fires built by wounded\r\nsoldiers who had crawled together to protect themselves from the cold\r\nof the night and to roast a piece of horseflesh. On September 12th. the\r\nWestphalians moved to Moshaisk, which was deserted by all inhabitants,\r\nplundered, and half in ashes. While the battle raged several thousand\r\nwounded Russians had taken refuge there, who now, some alive and some\r\ndead, filled all the houses of the town. Burnt bodies were lying in the\r\nruins of the houses which had been burnt, the entrance of these places\r\nbeing almost blockaded by cadavers. The only church, which stood on the\r\npublic square in the middle of the town, contained several hundred\r\nwounded and as many corpses of men dead for a number of days. One\r\nglance into this infected church, a regular pest-house, made the blood\r\ncurdle. Surgeons went inside and had the dead piled up on the square\r\naround the church; those still alive and suffering received the first\r\naid, order was established and gradually a hospital arranged. Soldiers,\r\nWestphalians as well as Russian prisoners, were ordered to remove the\r\ncorpses from the houses and the streets, and then a recleansing of the\r\nwhole town was necessary before it could be occupied by the troops.\r\nAlthough there was only one stone building—and a hundred wooden ones—it\r\ngave quarters to the whole Westphalian corps. Two regiments, one of\r\nHussars, the other of the light Horse Guards, both together numbering\r\nnot more than 300 men, had taken possession of a monastery in the\r\nneighborhood. Two regiments of cuirassiers had marched with the French\r\nto Moscow.\r\n\r\nIn the quarters of Moshaisk the Westphalians enjoyed a time of rest,\r\nwhile the events in Moscow took place. The fate of those who had\r\nremained in Moshaisk was not enviable, but what had been left of the\r\ntown offered at least shelter during the cold nights of the approaching\r\nwinter. This was a good deal after the fearful hardships, and it\r\ncontributed much toward the recuperation of the soldiers. Convalescents\r\narrived daily, also such as had remained in the rear; a number of the\r\nslightly wounded were able for duty again, and in this manner the\r\nnumber of men increased to 4,500. Life in Moshaisk was a constant\r\nstruggle for sustenance. There were no inhabitants, not even a single\r\ndog or any other living animal which the inhabitants had left behind.\r\nSome provisions found in houses or hidden somewhere benefitted only\r\nthose who had discovered them. The place upon the whole was a desert\r\nfor the hungry. Small detachments had to be sent out for supplies. At\r\nfirst this system proved satisfactory, and with what had been brought\r\nin from the vicinity regular rations could be distributed. But the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation had become so predominating that every\r\none thought only of himself. Officers would send men clandestinely for\r\ntheir own sake, and when this was discovered it ended in a fight and\r\nmurder. Everyone was anxious to provide for himself individually, to be\r\nprepared for the coming winter. Sutlers and speculators went to Moscow\r\nto take advantage of the general pillage, to procure luxuries, like\r\ncoffee, sugar, tea, wine, delicacies of all description.\r\nNotwithstanding the great conflagration at Moscow immense stores of all\r\nthese things had come into the hands of the French, and this had an\r\ninfluence on Moshaisk, forty miles away from the metropolis, von Borke\r\nwas fortunate enough to secure a supply of coffee, tea, and sugar,\r\nsufficient not only for himself, but also for some friends, and lasting\r\neven for some weeks on the retreat. But the supply of meat, and\r\nespecially bread, was inadequate for the mass of soldiers. Ten days had\r\nelapsed when the situation of those in Moshaisk became grave again,\r\nnamely, when communication with Moscow was cut off. Orderlies did not\r\narrive, no more convalescents came, news could not be had, details of\r\nsoldiers sent out for supplies were killed or taken prisoner by\r\nCossacks. The retreat of the French army, the last act of the great\r\ndrama, commenced.\r\n\r\nWhile the Westphalians guarded the battle-field the army marched to\r\nMoscow, exhausted, starving, finding new sufferings every day. On the\r\nroad from Moshaisk to Moscow they encountered frightful conditions in\r\nthe villages which were filled with wounded Russians. These\r\nunfortunates, abandoned to cruel privations, dying as much from\r\nstarvation as from their wounds, excited pity. The water even was\r\nscarce, and when a source was discovered it was generally polluted,\r\nsoiled with all sorts of filth, infected by cadavers; but all this did\r\nnot prevent the soldiers from drinking it with great avidity, and they\r\nfought among themselves to approach it. All these details have to be\r\nknown before studying typhus in the grand army.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe description of diseases given by the physicians who lived a century\r\nago is for us unsatisfactory; we cannot understand what they meant by\r\ntheir vague designating of hepatitis, fibrous enteritis, diarrhoea and\r\ndysentery, peripneumonia, remittent and intermittent gastric fever,\r\nprotracted nervous fever, typhus and synochus; there is no distinction\r\nmade in any of the writings of that period between abdominal and\r\nexanthematic typhus.\r\n\r\nHowever, before long physicians will discard much from our present\r\nmedical onomatology that is ridiculous, absurd, incorrect, in short,\r\nunscientific, as, for instance, the designation typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nEbstein has pointed out all that is obscure to us in the reports of the\r\nphysicians of the Russian campaign; for instance, that we cannot\r\ndistinguish what is meant by the different forms of fever. According to\r\nthe views of those times fever was itself a disease _per se_; when\r\nreaction was predominating it was called synocha, typhus when weakness\r\nwas the feature, and in case of a combination of synocha and typhus it\r\nwas called synochus, a form in which there was at first an inflammatory\r\nand later on a typhoid stage, but which form could not be distinguished\r\nexactly from typhus. From all the descriptions in the reports of the\r\nRussian campaign it can be deduced that many of the cases enumerated\r\nwere of exanthematic typhus, notwithstanding that the symptomatology\r\ngiven is very incomplete, not to speak of the pathological anatomy. The\r\nonly writer who has described necropsies is von Scherer. Some of the\r\nphysicians speak only of the sick and the diseases, as Bourgeois, who\r\nsays that on the march to Russia during the sultry weather the many\r\ncadavers of horses putrefied rapidly, filling the air with miasms, and\r\nthat this caused much disease; further, in describing the retreat he\r\nonly says that the army was daily reduced in consequence of the\r\nconstant fighting, the privations and diseases, without enumerating\r\nwhich diseases were prevailing; only in a note attached to his booklet\r\nhe mentions that the most frequent of the ravaging diseases of that\r\ntime and during the Russian campaign in general was typhus, and there\r\ncan be no doubt it was petechial or exanthematic typhus, for which the\r\nEnglish literature has the vague name typhus fever.\r\n\r\nVery interesting are the historical data given by Ebstein: “As is well\r\nknown, the fourth and most severe typhus period of the eighteenth\r\ncentury began with the wars of the French revolution and ended only\r\nduring the second decade of the nineteenth century with the downfall of\r\nthe Napoleonic empire and the restoration of peace in Germany.” During\r\nthe Russian campaign the conditions for spreading the disease were\r\ncertainly the most favorable imaginable.\r\n\r\nKrantz, whom I shall quote later on, has described the ophthalmy\r\nprevailing in York’s corps as being of a mild character.\r\n\r\nQuite different forms reigned among the soldiers on their retreat from\r\nMoscow.\r\n\r\nThe description of the death from frost given by von Scherer is similar\r\nto that given by Bourgeois. The men staggered as if drunk, their faces\r\nwere red and swollen, it looked as if all their blood had risen into\r\ntheir head. Powerless they dropped, as if paralyzed, the arms were\r\nhanging down, the musket fell out of their hands. The moment they lost\r\ntheir strength tears came to their eyes, repeatedly they arose,\r\napparently deprived of their senses, and stared shy and terror-stricken\r\nat their surroundings. The physiognomy, the spasmodic contractions of\r\nthe muscles of the face, manifested the cruel agony which they\r\nsuffered. The eyes were very red, and drops of blood trickled from the\r\nconjunctiva. Without exaggeration it could be said of these\r\nunfortunates that they shed bloody tears. These severe forms of\r\nophthalmy caused by extreme cold would have ended in gangraene of the\r\naffected parts if death had not relieved the misery of these\r\nunfortunates.\r\n\r\nBut Bourgeois describes another very severe form of ophthalmy among the\r\nsoldiers which caused total blindness. It appeared when the army on its\r\nretreat was in the vicinity of Orscha, attacked many soldiers and\r\nresembled the ophthalmy which was prevailing in Egypt; there it was\r\ncaused by the heated sand reflecting powerfully the rays of the sun;\r\nhere, by the glaring white snow likewise reflecting the rays of the\r\nsun. Bourgeois considers as predisposing moments the smoke of the\r\ncamp-fires, the want of sleep, the marching during the night, and\r\ndescribes the affection as follows: The conjunctiva became dark red,\r\nswelled together with the eyelids; there was a greatly exaggerated\r\nlachrymal secretion associated with severe pain; the eyes were\r\nconstantly wet, the photophobia reached such a degree that the men\r\nbecame totally blind, suffered most excruciating pain and fell on the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nEbstein availed himself of the publications of J. L. R. de Kerckhove,\r\nRéné Bourgeois, J. Lemazurier, and Joh. von Scherer, and the manuscript\r\nof Harnier from which writings he collected all that refers to the\r\ndiseases of the grand army. It may not be out of place to quote the\r\ninteresting writings of de Kerckhove concerning the army physicians and\r\nNapoleon and his soldiers:\r\n\r\nDe Kerckhove left Mayence on March 6th., 1812, attached to the\r\nheadquarters of the 3rd. corps, commanded by Ney; at Thorn he joined\r\nthose braves with whom he entered Moscow on September 14th. and with\r\nwhom he left on October 19th. When he returned to Berlin in the\r\nbeginning of February, 1813, the 3rd. corps was discharged. He writes:\r\nThe army was not only the most beautiful, but there was none which\r\nincluded so many brave warriors, more heroes. How many parents have\r\ncried over the loss of their children tenderly raised by them, how many\r\nsons, the only hope and support of their father and mother, have\r\nperished, how many bonds of friendship have been severed, how many\r\ncouples have been separated forever, how many unfortunate ones drawn\r\ninto misery? An army extinguished by hunger and cold!\r\n\r\nGiving credit to the physicians and surgeons who took part in that\r\nunfortunate expedition he says: With what noble zeal they tried to do\r\ntheir duties. The horror of the privations, the severity of the climate\r\nand fatigues and the want of eatables and medicines which characterized\r\nthe hospitals and ambulances in Russia, have not discouraged the\r\nphysicians so far as to become indifferent to the terrible fate\r\nreserved for the sick. On the contrary, far from allowing themselves to\r\nrelax, they have doubled their activity to ameliorate sufferings. We\r\nhave seen physicians in the midst of the carnage and the terror of the\r\nbattles extend their care and bring consolation; we have seen them\r\nsacrificing day and night in hospital service, succumbing to murderous\r\nepidemics; in one word, despising all danger when it was a question of\r\nrelieving the sufferings of the warriors, immaterial whether Russian or\r\nFrench. We can speak of many sick or wounded left in ambulances or\r\nhospitals in want of food and medicines, many of such unfortunates\r\ndeprived of everything, dragging themselves under the ruins of cities\r\nor villages, who found help from honest physicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND ARMY IN MOSCOW\r\n\r\n\r\nThree fifths of the houses and one half of the churches were destroyed.\r\nThe citizens had burned their capital. Before this catastrophe of 1812\r\nMoscow was an aristocratic city. According to old usage, the Russian\r\nnobility spent the winter there, they came from their country seats\r\nwith hundreds of slaves and servants and many horses; their palaces in\r\nthe city were surrounded by parks and lakes, and many buildings were\r\nerected on the grounds, as lodgings for the servants and slaves,\r\nstables, magazines. The number of servants was great, many of them\r\nserving for no other purpose than to increase the number, and this\r\ncalling was part of the luxury of the noblemen. The house of the\r\nseigneur was sometimes of brick, rarely of stone, generally of wood,\r\nall were covered with copper plates or with iron, painted red or green.\r\nThe magazines were mostly stone buildings, on account of the danger of\r\nfire. At that time the Russian nobility had not yet accustomed itself\r\nto consider St. Petersburg the capital, they were obstinate in the\r\ndetermination to come every winter to hold court in the mother of\r\nRussian cities. The conflagration of 1812 broke this tradition. The\r\nnobility, not willing or not being able to rebuild their houses, rented\r\nthe ground to citizens, and industry, prodigiously developing since\r\nthen, has taken possession of Moscow. This is how the city has lost its\r\nfloating population of noblemen and serfs, which amounted to 100\r\nthousand souls, and how the aristocratic city has become an industrial\r\none. It is a new city, but the fire of 1812, from the ashes of which it\r\nhas risen, has left impressions on the monuments. Step by step in the\r\nKremlin and in the city proper are found souvenirs of the patriotic\r\nwar. You enter the Kremlin which Napoleon tried to explode, and which\r\nhas been restored, you visit there the church of the Annunciation, and\r\nyou will be told that the French soldiers had stabled their horses on\r\nthe pavement of agate; you visit the church of the Assumption and you\r\nwill be shown the treasures which, on the approach of the French, had\r\nbeen taken to places of safety; you raise your eye to the summit of the\r\ntower of Ivan and you learn that the cross had been removed by the\r\ninvaders and found in the baggage of the Grand Army. The door of St.\r\nNicholas has an inscription recalling the miracle by which this door\r\nwas saved in 1812. The tower surmounting it was split by an explosion\r\nfrom above downward, but the fissure ended at the very point where the\r\nicon is found; the explosion of 500 pounds of powder did not break even\r\nthe glass which covers the image or the crystal of the lamp which burns\r\nbefore it. Along the walls of the arsenal are the cannon taken from the\r\nenemy, and in the arsenal are other trophies, including the camp-bed of\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\nRussian accounts from eye-witnesses of the conflagration are few—in\r\nfact, there exists none in writing. People who witnessed the\r\ncatastrophe could not write. What we possess are collections from\r\nverbal accounts given by servants, serfs, who had told the events to\r\ntheir masters. Nobody of distinction had remained in Moscow, none of\r\nthe nobility, the clergy, the merchants. The persons from whom the\r\nfollowing accounts are given were the nun Antonine, a former slave of\r\nthe Syraxine family, the little peddler Andreas Alexieef, a woman,\r\nAlexandra Alexievna Nazarot, an old slave of the family Soimonof by the\r\nname of Basilli Ermolaevitch, the wife of a pope, Maria Stepanova, the\r\nwife of another pope, Helene Alexievna. A Russian lady has collected\r\nwhat she had learned from these humble people, the eye-witnesses of the\r\ncatastrophe, and published it, pseudonym, in some Russian journal. All\r\nthese people had minutely narrated their experiences to her at great\r\nlength, not omitting any detail which concerned themselves or\r\ncircumstances which caused their surprise, and they all gave the dates,\r\nthe hours which they had tenaciously kept in their memory for sixty\r\nyears, for it was in the year 1872 when the Russian lady interrogated\r\nthem. Some had retained from those days of terror such vivid\r\nimpressions that a conflagration or the sight of a soldier’s casque\r\nwould cause them palpitation of the heart. There is much repetition in\r\ntheir narrations, for all had seen the same: the invasion, the enemy,\r\nthe fire kindled by their own people, the misery, the dearth, the\r\npillage. There exist documents of the events in Moscow of 1812, the\r\nsouvenirs of Count de Toll, the apology of Rostopchine, which we shall\r\ncome to in another chapter, the recitals of Domerque, of Wolzogen, of\r\nSégur, but these reminiscences of people in Moscow are the only ones\r\nfrom persons who actually suffered by the catastrophe, and they are in\r\ntheir way as valuable as the writings of our two writers, von Scherer\r\nand von Borcke. These plain people know nothing of the days of Erfurt,\r\nnothing of the continental blocus, nothing of the withdrawal of\r\nAlexander from the French Alliance; the bearers of the toulloupes\r\n(sheepskin furs) in the streets of Moscow of the beginning of 1812 knew\r\nnothing of the confederation of the Rhine; all they knew of Bonaparte\r\nwas that he had often beaten the Germans, and that on his account they\r\nhad to pay more for sugar and coffee. To them the great comet of 1811\r\nwas the first announcement of coming great events. Let us see the\r\nreflections which the comet inspired in the abbess of the Devitchi\r\nconvent and the nun Antonine, and this will give us an idea of the\r\nmental condition of the latter, one of the narrators. “One evening,”\r\nshe relates, “we were at service in St. John’s church, when all of a\r\nsudden I noticed on the horizon a gerbe of resplendent flames. I cried\r\nout and dropped my lantern. Mother abbess came to me to learn what had\r\ncaused my fright, and when she also had seen the meteor she\r\ncontemplated a long time. I asked, Matouchka, what star is this? She\r\nanswered this is no star, this is a comet. I asked again what is a\r\ncomet? I never had heard that word. The mother then explained to me\r\nthat this was a sign from heaven which God had sent to foretell great\r\nmisfortune. Every evening this comet was seen, and we asked ourselves\r\nwhat calamity this one might bring us. In the cells of the convent, in\r\nthe shops of the city, the news, traveling as the crow flies, was heard\r\nthat Bonaparte was leading against Russia an immense army, the like of\r\nwhich the world had never seen. Only the veterans of the battles of\r\nAusterlitz, Eylau, and Friedland could give some information, some\r\ndetails of the character of the invader. The direction which Napoleon\r\ntook on his march left no doubt to any one that he would appear in\r\nMoscow. In order to raise the courage which was sinking they had the\r\nmiraculous image of the Virgin conductrice brought from Smolensk, which\r\nplace was to be visited by the French. This icon was exposed in the\r\ncathedral of St. Michael the Archangel, for veneration by the people.\r\nThe abbess of our convent, who was from Smolensk, had a special\r\ndevotion for this image, she went with all the nuns to salute the\r\nProtatrix. At St. Michael the Archangel there was a great crowd so that\r\none hardly could stand, especially were there many women, all crying.\r\nWhen we, the nuns, began to push, to get near the image, one after the\r\nother in a line endlessly long, they looked upon us with impatience.\r\nOne woman said: ‘These soutanes should make room for us, it is not\r\ntheir husbands, it is our husbands’, our sons’ heads, which will be\r\nexposed to the guns.’”\r\n\r\nRostopchine tried his best to keep the population at peace by his\r\noriginal proclamations, which were pasted on all the walls and\r\ndistributed broadcast. After Borodino he urged the people to take up\r\narms, and he promised to be at the head of the men to fight a supreme\r\nbattle on the Three Mountains. Meanwhile he worked to save the\r\ntreasures of the church, the archives, the collections of precious\r\nobjects in the government palaces. From the arsenal he armed the\r\npeople. A tribune was erected from which the metropolitan addressed the\r\nmultitude and made them kneel down to receive his blessing. Rostopchine\r\nstood behind the metropolitan and came forward after the priest had\r\nfinished his ellocution, saying that he had come to announce a great\r\nfavor of his majesty. As a proof that they should not be delivered\r\nunarmed to the enemy, his majesty permitted them to pillage the\r\narsenal, and the people shouted: “Thanks, may God give to the Tzar many\r\nyears to live!” This was a very wise idea of Rostopchine to have the\r\narsenal emptied, a feat which he could not have accomplished in time in\r\nany other way. The pillage lasted several days and went on in good\r\norder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe French had entered Moscow. The first word of Napoleon to Mortier,\r\nwhom he had named governor of Moscow, was “no pillage!” But this point\r\nof honor had to be abandoned. The 100 thousand men who had entered were\r\ntroops of the élite, but they came starving at the end of their\r\nadventurous expedition. During the first days they walked the streets\r\nin search of a piece of bread and a little wine. But little had been\r\nleft in the cellars of the abandoned houses and in the basements of the\r\nlittle shops, and with the conflagration there was almost nothing to be\r\nfound. The Grand Army was starving as much almost as on the march. Dogs\r\nwhich had returned in considerable numbers to lament on the ruins of\r\nthe houses of their masters were looked upon as precious venison. The\r\nuniforms were already in rags, and the Russian climate made itself\r\nfelt. These poor soldiers, poorly clad, dying from starvation, were\r\nbegging for a piece of bread, for linen or sheepskin, and, above all,\r\nfor shoes. There was no arrangement for the distribution of rations;\r\nthey had to take from wherever they could, or perish.\r\n\r\nNapoleon established himself in the Kremlin, the generals in the\r\nmansions of the noblemen, the soldiers in the taverns or private houses\r\nuntil the fire dislodged them. Napoleon, with a part of his staff, was\r\nobliged to seek refuge in the park Petrovski, the commanders took\r\nquarters wherever they could, the soldiers dispersed themselves among\r\nthe ruins. Supervision had become an impossibility. The men, left to\r\nthemselves, naturally lost all discipline under these circumstances of\r\ndeception and under so many provocations among a hostile population.\r\nNotwithstanding all these conditions, they behaved well in general and\r\nto a great extent showed self-control and humanity toward the\r\nconquered. The example of pillage had been set by the Russians\r\nthemselves. Koutouzof had commanded the destruction of the mansions.\r\nThe slaves burned the palaces of their masters.\r\n\r\nAll eye-witnesses speak of the extreme destitution of the soldiers in\r\nregard to clothing after one month’s stay in Moscow. Already at this\r\ntime, even before the most terrible and final trials of the retreat\r\nwhich awaited them, one had to consider them lost. When they first took\r\nto woman’s clothes or shoes or hats it was considered an amusement, a\r\njoke, but very soon a mantilla, a soutane, a veil became a precious\r\nobject and nobody laughed at it when frozen members were wrapped in\r\nthese garments. The greatest calamity was the want of shoes. Some\r\nsoldiers followed women simply for the purpose of taking their shoes\r\nfrom them. A special chapter of horrors could be written on the\r\nsufferings of the soldiers on the retreat over ice and snow fields on\r\naccount of the miserable supply of shoes.\r\n\r\nAt first Napoleon reviewed the regiments near the ponds of the Kremlin,\r\nand at the first reviews the troops marched proudly, briskly, with firm\r\nstep, but soon they began to fail with astonishing rapidity. They\r\nanswered the roll of the drums calling them together, clad in dirty\r\nrags and with torn shoes, in fast diminishing numbers. During the last\r\nweeks of their stay in Moscow many had reached the last stage of\r\nmisery, after having wandered through the streets looking for a little\r\nbit of nourishment, dressed up as for a carnival, but without desire to\r\ndance, as one remarked in grim humor.\r\n\r\nThese were the men whose destination had brought them many hundreds of\r\nmiles from home to the semi-Asiatic capital of the Ivans, who had been\r\ndrinking in the glory and the joy of warriors, and who now died from\r\nhunger and cold, with their laurels still intact. Thanks to the\r\nauthorized military requisitions and the excesses of the stragglers of\r\nthe Grand Army, a desert had been made of the city before Napoleon had\r\nbegun his retreat. No more cattle, no provisions, and the inhabitants\r\ngone, camping with wife and children in the deepest parts of the\r\nforests. Those who had remained or returned to the villages, organized\r\nagainst marauders whom they received with pitchforks or rifles, and\r\nthese peasants gave no quarter.\r\n\r\n“The enemy appeared nearly every day in our village (Bogorodsic),” says\r\nMaria Stepanova, the wife of a pope, “and as soon as they were\r\nperceived all men took up arms; our cossacks charged them with their\r\nlong sabers or shot them with their pistols, and behind the cossacks\r\nwere running the peasants, some with axes, some with pitchforks. After\r\nevery excursion they brought ten or more prisoners which they drowned\r\nin the Protka which runs near the village, or they fusilladed them on\r\nthe prairie. The unfortunates passed our windows, my mother and I did\r\nnot know where to hide ourselves in order not to hear their cries and\r\nthe report of the firearms. My poor husband, Ivan Demitovitch, became\r\nquite pale, the fever took him, his teeth chattered, he was so\r\ncompassionate! One day the cossacks brought some prisoners and locked\r\nthem up in a cart-house built of stone. They are too few, they said, it\r\nis not worth while to take any trouble about them now; with the next\r\nlot which we shall take we will shoot or drown them together. This\r\ncart-house had a window with bars. Peasants came to look at the\r\nprisoners and gave them bread and boiled eggs; they did not want to see\r\nthem starving while awaiting death. One day when I brought them\r\neatables I saw at the window a young soldier—so young! His forehead was\r\npressed against the bars, tears in his eyes, and tears running down his\r\ncheeks. I myself began to cry, and even to-day my heart aches when I\r\nthink of him. I passed lepecheks through the bars and went away without\r\nlooking behind me. At that time came an order from the government that\r\nno more prisoners should be killed but sent to Kalouga. How we were\r\ncontented!”\r\n\r\nMany savageries have been committed by the low class of Russians who\r\nhad remained in Moscow. This is not surprising because these were of\r\nthe most depraved of the population, including especially many\r\ncriminals who had been set free to pillage and burn the city. “A little\r\nwhile before the French entered,” tells the serf Soimonof, “the order\r\nhad been given to empty all the vodka (whiskey) from the distilleries\r\nof the crown into the street; the liquor was running in rivulets, and\r\nthe rabble drank until they were senselessly drunk, they had even\r\nlicked the stones and the wooden pavement. Shouting and fighting\r\nnaturally followed.”\r\n\r\nThe really good people of Moscow had given proofs of high moral\r\nqualities, worthy of admiration, under the sad circumstances. Poor\r\nmoujiks who had learned of the defeat of the Russians at Borodino said\r\ntheir place was no longer in a city which was to be desecrated by the\r\npresence of the enemy, and, leaving their huts to be burned down, their\r\nmiserable belongings to be pillaged, they went on the highways at the\r\nmercy of God, disposed to march as long as their eyes could see before\r\nthem. Others, running before the flames, carried their aged and sick on\r\ntheir shoulders, showing but one sentiment in their complete ruin,\r\nnamely, absolute resignation to the will of God.\r\n\r\nSome readers may say that the foregoing chapter does not give the\r\nmedical history of the campaign. To these I wish to reply that it is\r\nimpossible to understand the medical history without knowing the\r\ngeneral conditions of the Grand Army, which were the cause of the death\r\nof hundreds of thousands of soldiers from cold and starvation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSTOPCHINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conflagration of Moscow in 1812 and the fall of the French empire\r\nare two facts which cannot be separated, but to the name of Moscow is\r\nattached another name, that of Rostopchine. Count Fedor Wassiljavitch\r\nRostopchine is connected with one of the greatest events in universal\r\nhistory. He caused a crisis which decided the fate of Russia and\r\narrested the march of ascending France by giving the death blow to\r\nNapoleon. The latter, in admitting that Rostopchine was the author of\r\nhis ruin, meant him when he said, “one man less, and I would have been\r\nmaster of the world.”\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1876 there existed a mystery around this man and his\r\ndeed, a mystery which was deepened by Rostopchine himself when he\r\npublished in 1823 a pamphlet entitled “The Truth about the\r\nConflagration of Moscow,” which did not give the truth but was a\r\nmystification.\r\n\r\nAlexander Popof, a Russian Counselor of State, who made a special study\r\nof the history of the Russian campaign of Napoleon, has explored the\r\narchives of St. Petersburg, and his researches, the result of which he\r\npublished in Russian in the year 1876, have brought to light all\r\ndiplomacy had concealed about the events which led to the destruction\r\nof the Russian capital.\r\n\r\nWhat document, one might ask, could be more precious than the memoirs\r\nof Rostopchine, the governor of Moscow in 1812? What good fortune for\r\nthe historian! In 1872 Count Anatole de Ségur, grandson of Rostopchine,\r\nthe author of a biography of the latter, wrote, concerning these\r\nmemoirs, that they were seized, together with all the papers of his\r\ngrand-father, by order of the Emperor Nicholas, immediately after\r\nRostopchine’s death in the year 1826, and were locked up in the\r\narchives of the Imperial Chancellor where they would remain, perhaps\r\nforever. Fortunately, one of the daughters of Count Rostopchine had\r\ntaken a copy of some passages of this precious manuscript. These\r\npassages were published in 1864 by a son of Rostopchine, Count Alexis\r\nR., in a book entitled “Materiaux en grande partie inédits, pour la\r\nbiographie future du Comte Rostopchine,” which is of a rare\r\nbibliographic value, for only twelve copies were printed. These same\r\nfragments, three in number, were reproduced by Count Anatole de Ségur\r\nin the biography of his ancestor, of which we have spoken. Aside from\r\nthese extracts nothing was known of Rostopchine’s memoirs until Popof\r\nhad made his researches. To verify the memoirs Popof quotes long\r\npassages which he compares carefully with other documents of that\r\nepoch. This book on the whole is a continuous commentary upon the\r\nmemoirs of Rostopchine.\r\n\r\nRostopchine, having been made governor of Moscow in March, 1812, wrote\r\nto the Tzar: “Your empire has two strongholds, its immensity and its\r\nclimate. It has these 16,000,000 men who profess the same creed, speak\r\nthe same language, and whose chin has never been touched by a razor.\r\nThe long beards are the power of Russia, and the blood of your soldiers\r\nwill be a seed of heroes. If unfortunate circumstances should force you\r\nto retreat before the invader, the Russian emperor will always be\r\nterrible in Moscow, formidable in Kazan, invincible at Tobolsk.” This\r\nletter was dated June 11/23, 1812.\r\n\r\nAt that time Rostopchine was 47 years of age, in perfect health and had\r\ndeveloped a most extraordinary activity, something which was not known\r\nof his predecessors; the governors of Moscow before his time had been\r\nold and decrepit. He understood the character of the Russian people and\r\nmade himself popular at once, and adored, because he made himself\r\naccessible to everybody. He himself describes how he went to work: “I\r\nannounced that every day from 11 to noon everybody had access to me,\r\nand those who had something important to communicate would be received\r\nat any hour during the day. On the day of my taking charge I had\r\nprayers said and candles lighted before such miraculous pictures as\r\nenjoyed the highest popular veneration. I studied to show an\r\nextraordinary politeness to all who had dealings with me; I courted the\r\nold women, the babblers and the pious, especially the latter. I\r\nresorted to all means to make myself agreeable; I had the coffins\r\nraised which served as signs to the undertakers and the inscriptions\r\npasted on the church doors. It took me two days to pull the wool over\r\ntheir eyes (_pour jeter la poudre aux yeux_) and to persuade the\r\ngreater part of the inhabitants that I was indefatigable and that I was\r\neverywhere. I succeeded in giving this idea by appearing on the same\r\nmorning at different places, far apart from each other, leaving traces\r\neverywhere of my justice and severity; thus on the first day I had\r\narrested an officer of the military hospital whose duty it was to\r\noversee the distribution of the soup, but who had not been present when\r\nit was time for dinner. I rendered justice to a peasant who had bought\r\n30 pounds of salt but received only 25; I gave the order to imprison an\r\nemployee who had not done his duty; I went everywhere, spoke to\r\neveryone and learned many things which afterward were useful to me.\r\nAfter having tired to death two pairs of horses I came home at 8\r\no’clock, changed my civilian costume for the military uniform and made\r\nmyself ready to commence my official work.” Thus Rostopchine took the\r\nMoscovitians by their foibles, played the rôle of Haroun-al-Raschid,\r\nplayed comedy; he even employed agents to carry the news of the town to\r\nhim, to canvass war news and to excite enthusiasm in the cafés and in\r\nall kinds of resorts of the common people.\r\n\r\nWhen the emperor notified him one day of his coming visit to the\r\ncapital and transmitted a proclamation in which he announced to his\r\npeople the danger of the country, Rostopchine developed great activity.\r\n“I went to work,” he writes in his memoirs, “was on my feet day and\r\nnight, held meetings, saw many people, had printed along with the\r\nimperial proclamation a bulletin worded after my own fashion, and the\r\nnext morning the people of Moscow on rising learned of the coming of\r\nthe sovereign. The nobility felt flattered on account of the confidence\r\nwhich the emperor placed in them, and became inspired with a noble\r\nzeal, the merchants were ready to give money, only the common people\r\napparently remained indifferent, because they did not believe it\r\npossible that the enemy could enter Moscow.” The longbeards repeated\r\nincessantly:\r\n\r\n“Napoleon cannot conquer us, he would have to exterminate us all.”\r\n\r\nBut the streets became crowded with people, the stores were closed,\r\nevery one went first to the churches to pray for the Tzar, and from\r\nthere to the gate of Dragomilof to salute the imperial procession upon\r\nits arrival. The enthusiasm ran so high that the idea was conceived to\r\nunhitch the horses from his coach and carry him in his carriage. This,\r\nas Rostopchine tells us, was the intention not only of the common\r\npeople but of many distinguished ones also, even of such as wore\r\ndecorations. The emperor, to avoid such exaggerated manifestations, was\r\nobliged to arrange for his entry during the night. On the next morning\r\nwhen the Tzar, according to the old custom, showed himself to his\r\npeople on the red stairs, the hurrahs, the shouts of the multitude\r\ndrowned the sounds of the bells of the forty times forty churches which\r\nwere ringing in the city. At every step, thousands of hands tried to\r\ntouch the limbs of the sovereign or the flap of his uniform which they\r\nkissed and wet with their tears.\r\n\r\n“I learned during the night,” writes Rostopchine, “and it was confirmed\r\nin the morning, that there were some persons who had united to ask the\r\nemperor how many troops we had, how many the enemy, and what were the\r\nmeans of defense. This would have been a bold and, under the present\r\ncircumstances, a dangerous undertaking, although I hardly feared that\r\nthese people would venture to do so, because they were of those who are\r\nbrave in private and poltroons in public.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, I had said repeatedly and before everybody that I hoped\r\nto offer the emperor the spectacle of an assembly of a faithful and\r\nrespectful nobility, and that I should be in despair if some malevolent\r\nperson should permit himself to create disorder and forget the presence\r\nof the sovereign. I promised that any one who would do this might be\r\nsure of being taken in hand and sent on a long journey before he would\r\nhave finished his harangue.\r\n\r\n“To give more weight to my words I had stationed, not far from the\r\npalace, two telegues (two-wheeled carts) hitched up with mail horses\r\nand two police officers in road uniform promenading before them. If\r\nsome curious person should ask them for whom these telegues were ready,\r\nthey had orders to answer, ‘for those who will be sent to Siberia.’\r\n\r\n“These answers and the news of the telegues soon spread among the\r\nassembly; the bawlers understood and behaved.”\r\n\r\nThe nobility of Riazen had sent a deputation to the emperor to offer\r\nhim 60 thousand men, armed and equipped. Balachef, the minister of\r\npolice, received this deputation scornfully and ordered them to leave\r\nMoscow at once.\r\n\r\nThere were other offers which were not surprising at that period when\r\nthe mass of the people consisted of serfs, but which appear strange to\r\nus. “Many of my acquaintances,” writes Kamarovski, “said that they\r\nwould give their musicians, others the actors of their theaters, others\r\ntheir hunters, as it was easier to make soldiers of them than of their\r\npeasants.”\r\n\r\nThe Russian noblemen in their love for liberty sacrificed their slaves.\r\nRostopchine, together with many aristocrats, was not entirely at ease.\r\nIt was something anomalous to call to arms for the sake of liberty a\r\nnation of serfs who vividly felt the injustice of their situation;\r\nbesides, it had been heard that some moujiks said, “Bonaparte comes to\r\nbring us liberty, we do not want any more seigneurs.”\r\n\r\nThe Russian people in their generality, however, did not justify the\r\nfears of the aristocrats. Their religious fanaticism, nourished by the\r\npriests, their passionate devotion to the Tzar, made them forget their\r\nown, just complaints.\r\n\r\nIn Moscow business was at a standstill, the ordinary course of things\r\nwas likewise suspended, the population lived in the streets, forming a\r\nnervous crowd, subject to excitement and terror. The question was to\r\nkeep them in respectfulness.\r\n\r\nHere Rostopchine’s inborn talent as tribune and publicist, as comedian\r\nand tragedian, showed itself to perfection. He gave a free rein to his\r\nimagination in his placards, in which he affected the proverbial\r\nlanguage of the moujik, made himself a peasant, more than a peasant, in\r\nhis eccentric style, to excite patriotism. He published pamphlets\r\nagainst the French, and the coarser his language the more effect it had\r\non the masses.\r\n\r\n“At this time,” he writes, “I understood the necessity of acting on the\r\nmind of the people to arouse them so that they should prepare\r\nthemselves for all the sacrifices, for the sake of the country. Every\r\nday I disseminated stories and caricatures, which represented the\r\nFrench as dwarfs in rags, poorly armed, not heavier than a gerbe which\r\none could lift with a pitchfork.”\r\n\r\nFor curiosity’s sake, as an example of his style of fiction by which he\r\nfascinated the Russian peasantry may serve the translation of one of\r\nthe stories: “Korniouchka Tchikhirine, an inhabitant of Moscow, a\r\nveteran, having been drinking a little more than usual, hears that\r\nBonaparte is coming to Moscow, he becomes angry, scolds in coarse terms\r\nall Frenchmen, comes out of the liquor store and under the eagle with\r\nthe two heads (the sign that the place is the crown’s) he shouts: What,\r\nhe will come to us! But you are welcome! For Christmas or carnival you\r\nare invited. The girls await you with knots in their handkerchiefs,\r\nyour head will swell. You will do well to dress as the devil; we shall\r\nsay a prayer, and you will disappear when the cock crows. Do better,\r\nremain at home, play hide and seek or blind man’s buff. Enough of such\r\nfarces! don’t you see that your soldiers are cripples, dandies? They\r\nhave no touloupes, no mittens, no onoutchi (wrappings around the legs\r\nin place of stockings). How will they adapt themselves to Russian\r\nhabits? The cabbage will make them bloated, the gruel will make them\r\nsick, and those who survive the winter will perish by the frost at\r\nEpiphany. So it is, yes. At our house doors they will shiver, in the\r\nvestibule they will stand with chattering teeth; in the room they will\r\nsuffocate, on the stove they will be roasted. But what is the use of\r\nspeaking? As often as the pitcher goes to the well, as often their head\r\nwill be broken. Charles of Sweden was another imprudent one like you,\r\nof pure royal blood, he has gone to Poltava, he has not returned. Other\r\nrabbits than you Frenchmen were the Poles, the Tartars, the Swedes; our\r\nforefathers, however, have dealt with them so that one can yet see the\r\ntomb-hills around Moscow, as numerous as mushrooms, and under these\r\nmushrooms rest their bones. Ah! our holy mother Moscow, it is not a\r\ncity, it is an empire. You have left at home only the blind and the\r\nlame, the old women and the little children. Your size is not big\r\nenough to match the Germans; they will at the first blow throw you on\r\nyour back (this remark is wonderfully prophetic). And Russia, do you\r\nknow what that is, you cracked head? Six hundred thousand longbeards\r\nhave been enlisted, besides 300 thousand soldiers with bare chins, and\r\n200 thousand veterans. All these are heroes; they believe in one God,\r\nobey one Tzar, make the sign with one cross, these are all brethren.\r\nAnd if it pleases our father and Tzar, Alexander Pavlovitch, he has to\r\nsay only one word: To arms, Christians! And you will see them rising.\r\nAnd even if you should beat the vanguard? Take your ease! the others\r\nwill give you such a chase that the memory of it will remain in all\r\neternity. To come to us! well then! Not only the tower of Ivan the\r\nGreat, but also the hill of Prosternations will remain invisible to you\r\neven in your dream. We shall rely on white Russia and we shall bury you\r\nin Poland. As one makes his bed so one sleeps. On this account reflect,\r\ndo not proceed, do not start the dance. Turn about face, go home, and\r\nfrom generation to generation remember what it is, the Russian nation.\r\nHaving said all, Tchikhirine went on, briskly singing, and the people\r\nwho saw him go said wherever he came, that is well spoken, it is the\r\ntruth!”\r\n\r\nRostopchine knew very well how to make Tchikhirine speak when he had\r\nbeen drinking more than usual, he knew how to make the saints speak, he\r\ninvented pious legends which were not guaranteed by the Holy Synod and\r\nnot found in the Lives of the Saints.\r\n\r\n“After the battle of Borodino,” said he in his memoirs, “I ceased to\r\nhave recourse to little means to distract the people and occupy their\r\nattention. It required an extraordinary effort of the imagination to\r\ninvent something that would excite the people. The most ingenious\r\nattempts do not always succeed, while the clumsy ones take a surprising\r\neffect. Among those of the latter kind there was a story after my\r\nfashion of which 5 thousand copies at one kopek a copy were sold in one\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nThe population of Moscow was in a peculiar moral condition. They were\r\nmost superstitious, believed the most improbable reports and saw signs\r\nfrom heaven of the downfall of Napoleon.\r\n\r\n“In the city,” writes Rostopchine, “rumors were current of visions, of\r\nvoices which had been heard in the graveyards. Passages from the\r\nApocalypsis were quoted referring to Napoleon’s fall.”\r\n\r\nBut Rostopchine himself, was he free from credulity? A German by the\r\nname of Leppich constructed, secretly, in one of the gardens of Moscow,\r\na balloon by means of which the French army should be covered with\r\nfire, and some historians say that Rostopchine was one of the most\r\nenthusiastic admirers of Leppich.\r\n\r\nAs it may be interesting to learn how he was ahead of his time in\r\nregard to ideas about military balloons let us give the full statement\r\nof Popof on this matter.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 in Moscow it was exactly as in 1870 in Paris; everybody built\r\nhopes on the military airship, and expected that by means of a Greek\r\nfire from a balloon the whole army of the enemy would be annihilated.\r\nRostopchine, in a letter dated May 7/19, 1812, gave an account to\r\nEmperor Alexander of the precautions he had taken that the wonderful\r\nsecret of the construction of the airship by Leppich should not be\r\nrevealed. He took the precaution not to employ any workmen from Moscow.\r\nHe had already given Leppich 120 thousand rubles to buy material.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” he writes, “under the pretext of dining with some one\r\nliving in his vicinity I shall go to Leppich and shall remain with him\r\nfor a long time; it will be a feast to me to become more closely\r\nconnected with a man whose invention will render military art\r\nsuperfluous, free mankind of its internal destroyer, make of you the\r\narbiter of kings and empires and the benefactor of mankind.”\r\n\r\nIn another letter to the emperor, dated June 11/23, 1812, he writes, “I\r\nhave seen Leppich; he is a very able man and an excellent mechanician.\r\nHe has removed all my doubts in regard to the contrivances which set\r\nthe wings of his machine in motion (indeed an infernal construction)\r\nand which consequently might do still more harm to humanity than\r\nNapoleon himself. I am in doubt about one point which I submit to the\r\njudgment of your majesty: when the machine will be ready Leppich\r\nproposes to embark on it to fly as far as Wilna. Can we trust him so\r\ncompletely as not to think of treason on his part?” Three weeks later\r\nhe wrote to the emperor “I am fully convinced of success. I have taken\r\nquite a liking to Leppich who is also very much attached to me; his\r\nmachine I love like my own child. Leppich suggests that I should make\r\nan air voyage with him, but I cannot decide about this without the\r\nauthorization of your majesty.”\r\n\r\nOn September 11th., four days before the evacuation, the fate of Moscow\r\nwas decided. On that day at 10 o’clock in the forenoon the following\r\nconversation took place in the house of Rostopchine between him and\r\nGlinka.\r\n\r\n“Your excellency,” said Glinka, “I have sent my family away.”\r\n\r\n“I have already done the same,” answered the count, and tears were in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n“Now,” added he, “Serge Nicholaevitch, let us speak like two true\r\nfriends of our country. In your opinion, what will happen if Moscow is\r\nabandoned?”\r\n\r\n“Your excellency knows what I have dared to say on the 15/27 July in\r\nthe assembly of the nobility; but tell me in all frankness, count, how\r\nshall Moscow be delivered, with blood, or without blood (s kroviou ili\r\nbez krovi)?”\r\n\r\n“Bez krovi (without blood),” laconically answered the count.\r\n\r\nHis word to prince Eugene had been: Burn the capital rather than\r\ndeliver it to the enemy; to Ermilof: I do not see why you take so much\r\npains to defend Moscow at any price; if the enemy occupies the city he\r\nwill find nothing that could serve him.\r\n\r\nThe treasures which belong to the crown and all that is of some value\r\nhave already been removed; also, with few exceptions, the treasures of\r\nthe churches, the ornaments of gold and silver, the most important\r\narchives of the state, all have been taken to a place of safety. Many\r\nof the well-to-do have already taken away what is precious. There\r\nremain in Moscow only 50 thousand persons in the most miserable\r\nconditions who have no other asylum.\r\n\r\nThis was what he said on September 13, and on the same day he wrote to\r\nthe emperor that all had been sent away.\r\n\r\nBut this was not true; there still remained 10 thousand wounded—of whom\r\nthe majority would perish in case of a conflagration; there remained an\r\nimmense stock of provisions, flour and alcoholic liquor, which would\r\nfall into the hands of the enemy; there was still the arsenal in the\r\nKremlin containing 150 cannon, 60 thousand rifles, 160 thousand\r\ncartridges and a great deal of sulphur and saltpeter.\r\n\r\nDuring the night from the 14th. to the 15th. Rostopchine developed a\r\ngreat activity, though he could save only some miraculous images left\r\nin the churches, and destroy some magazines.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants suddenly aroused from their security went to the\r\nbarriers of the city and obstructed the streets with vehicles; to\r\nremove what still remained in Moscow the means of transportation and\r\nthe time allowed for this purpose were insufficient.\r\n\r\nThose who remained had nothing to lose and were glad to take revenge on\r\nthe rich by burning and pillaging their mansions.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th. the criminals in the prisons, with one-half of their heads\r\nshaved, were set at liberty that they might participate in the burning\r\nand pillaging.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Moscow Rostopchine uncovered his head and said to his\r\nson, “Salute Moscow for the last time; in half an hour it will be on\r\nfire.”\r\n\r\nQuite a literature has developed on the question: who has burned\r\nMoscow? The documents which Popof has examined leave no doubt\r\nconcerning Rostopchine’s part in regard to its conflagration. But,\r\nafter all, it was caused by those who had a right to do it, those who,\r\nbeginning at Smolensk, burned their villages, their hamlets, even their\r\nripening or ripened harvest, after the Russian army had passed and the\r\nenemy came in sight. Who? The Russian people of all classes, of all\r\nconditions without exception, men even invested with public power, and\r\namong them Rostopchine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRETREAT FROM MOSCOW\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the night from October 18th. to October 19th., all soldiers were\r\nbusy loading vehicles with provisions and baggage. On October 19th.,\r\nthe first day of the retreat, forever memorable on account of the\r\nmisfortune and heroism which characterized it, the grand army presented\r\na strange spectacle. The soldiers were in a fair condition, the horses\r\nlean and exhausted. But, above all, the masses following the army were\r\nextraordinary. After an immense train of artillery of 600 cannon, with\r\nall its supplies, came a train of baggage the like of which had never\r\nbeen seen since the centuries of migration when whole barbarous nations\r\nwent in search of new territories for settlement.\r\n\r\nThe fear that they might run short of rations had caused every\r\nregiment, every battalion, to carry on country wagons all they had been\r\nable to procure of bread and flour; but these wagons carrying\r\nprovisions were not the heaviest loaded, not loaded as much as those\r\nwhich were packed with booty from the conflagration of Moscow; in\r\naddition, many soldiers overtaxing their strength and endurance had\r\nfilled their knapsacks with provisions and booty. Most officers had\r\nsecured light Russian country wagons to carry provisions and warm\r\nclothing. The French, Italian, and German families, who lived in Moscow\r\nand now feared the returning Russians when again entering their\r\ncapital, had asked to accompany the retreating army and formed a kind\r\nof a colony among the soldiers; with these families were also\r\ntheatrical people and unfortunate women who had lived in Moscow on\r\nprostitution.\r\n\r\nThe almost endless number, the peculiarity of vehicles of all\r\ndescription, drawn by miserable horses, loaded with sacks of flour,\r\nclothing and furniture, with sick women and children, constituted a\r\ngreat danger, for the question was, how could the army maneuvre with\r\nsuch an impediment and, above all, defend itself against the Cossacks?\r\n\r\nNapoleon, surprised and almost alarmed, thought at first to establish\r\norder, but, after some reflection, came to the conclusion that the\r\naccidents of the road would soon reduce the quantity of this baggage,\r\nthat it would be useless to be severe with the poor creatures, that,\r\nafter all, the wagons would serve to transport the wounded. He\r\nconsented therefore to let all go along the best they could, he only\r\ngave orders that the column of these people with their baggage should\r\nkeep at a distance from the column of the soldiers in order that the\r\narmy would be able to maneuvre.\r\n\r\nOn October 24th. was the battle of Jaroslawetz in which the Russians,\r\nnumbering 24 thousand, fought furiously against 10 thousand or 11\r\nthousand French, to cut off the latter from Kalouga, and the French, on\r\ntheir part, fought with despair.\r\n\r\nThe center of the battle was the burning city taken and retaken seven\r\ntimes; many of the wounded perished in the flames, their cadavers\r\nincinerated, and 10 thousand dead covered the battlefield.\r\n\r\nMany of the wounded, who could not be transported had to be left to\r\ntheir fate at the theater of their glorious devotion, to the great\r\nsorrow of everybody, and many who had been taken along on the march\r\nduring the first days after the battle had also to be abandoned for\r\nwant of means of transportation. The road was already covered with\r\nwagons for which there were no horses.\r\n\r\nThe cries of the wounded left on the road were heartrending, in vain\r\ndid they implore their comrades not to let them die on the way,\r\ndeprived of all aid, at the mercy of the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nThe artillery was rapidly declining on account of the exhausted\r\ncondition of the horses. Notwithstanding all cursing and whipping, the\r\njaded animals were not able to drag the heavy pieces. Cavalry horses\r\nwere taken to overcome the difficulty and this caused a reduction of\r\nthe strength of the cavalry regiments without being of much service to\r\nthe artillery. The riders parted with their horses, they had tears in\r\ntheir eyes looking for the last time on their animals, but they did not\r\nutter a word.\r\n\r\nCavalrymen, with admirable perseverance and superhuman efforts, dragged\r\nthe cannon as far as Krasnoe. All men had dismounted and aided the\r\nexhausted animals only two of which were attached to each piece.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the misery of a three-days-march to Moshaisk all\r\nwere hopeful. The distance from Moshaisk to Smolensk was covered in\r\nseven or eight days; the weather, although cold during the night, was\r\ngood during the day, and the soldiers gladly anticipated to find, after\r\nsome more hardship, rest, abundance, and warm winter quarters in\r\nSmolensk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the march the army camped on the battlefield of Borodino when they\r\nsaw 50 thousand cadavers lying still unburied, broken wagons,\r\ndemolished cannons, helmets, cuirasses, guns spread all over—a horrid\r\nsight! Wherever the victims had fallen in large numbers one could see\r\nclouds of birds of prey rending the air with their sinister cries. The\r\nreflections which this sight excited were profoundly painful. How many\r\nvictims, and what result! The army had marched from Wilna to Witebsk,\r\nfrom Witebsk to Smolensk, hoping for a decisive battle, seeking this\r\nbattle at Wiasma, then at Ghjat, and had found it at last at Borodino,\r\na bloody, terrible battle. The army had marched to Moscow in order to\r\nearn the fruit of all that sacrifice, and at this place nothing had\r\nbeen found but an immense conflagration. The army returned without\r\nmagazines, reduced to a comparatively small number, with the prospect\r\nof a severe winter in Poland, and with a far away prospect of\r\npeace,—for peace could not be the price of a forced retreat,—and for\r\nsuch a result the field of Borodino was covered with 50 thousand dead.\r\nHere, as we have learned, were found the Westphalians, not more than 3\r\nthousand, the remainder of 10 thousand at Smolensk, of 23 thousand who\r\ncrossed the Niemen.\r\n\r\nNapoleon gave orders to take the wounded at Borodino into the baggage\r\nwagons and forced every officer, every refugee from Moscow who had a\r\nvehicle, to take the wounded as the most precious load.\r\n\r\nThe rear guard under Davout left the fearful place on October 31st.,\r\nand camped over night half-way to the little town of Ghjat. The night\r\nwas bitter cold, and the soldiers began to suffer very much from the\r\nlow temperature.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, every day made the retreat more difficult, for the\r\ncold became more and more severe from day to day, and the enemy more\r\npressing.\r\n\r\nThe Russian general, Kutusof, might now have marched ahead of\r\nNapoleon’s army, which was retarded by so many impediments, and\r\nannihilated it by a decisive battle, but he did not take this risk,\r\npreferring a certain and safe tactic, by constantly harassing the\r\nFrench, surprising one or the other of the rear columns by a sudden\r\nattack. He had a strong force of cavalry and artillery, and, above all,\r\ngood horses, while the rearguard of the French, for want of horses,\r\nconsisted of infantry; there was, for instance, nothing left of General\r\nGrouchy’s cavalry. The infantry of Marshal Davout, who commanded the\r\nrearguard, had to do the service of all arms, often being compelled to\r\nface the artillery of the enemy which had good horses, while their own\r\nwas dragged along by exhausted animals scarcely able to move.\r\n\r\nDavout’s men fought the Russians with the bayonet and took cannons from\r\nthem, but being without horses they were compelled to leave them on the\r\nroad, content rearguarding themselves to remain undisturbed for some\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nGradually the French had to part with their own cannons and ammunition;\r\nsinister explosions told the soldiers of increasing distress.\r\n\r\nAs it is in all great calamities of great masses: increasing misery\r\nalso increases egotism and heroism. Miserable drivers of wagons to whom\r\nthe wounded had been entrusted took advantage of the night and threw\r\nthe helpless wounded on the road where the rearguard found them dead or\r\ndying. The guilty drivers, when discovered, were punished; but it was\r\ndifficult to detect them, with the general confusion of the retreat\r\nmaking its first appearance.\r\n\r\nWounded soldiers who had been abandoned could be seen at every step.\r\nThe tail of the army, composed of stragglers, of tired, discouraged or\r\nsick soldiers, all marching without arms and without discipline,\r\ncontinually increased in number, to the mortification of the rearguard\r\nwhich had to deal with these men who would not subordinate their own\r\nselves to the welfare of the whole.\r\n\r\nIt is tempting to describe the terrible engagements, the almost\r\nsuperhuman, admirable bravery of Napoleon’s soldiers, who often, after\r\nhaving had the hardest task imaginable and constantly in danger of\r\nbeing annihilated, were forced to pass the bitter cold nights without\r\neating, without rest, and although all details bear on the medical\r\nhistory I am obliged to confine myself to a few sketches between the\r\ndescription of purely medical matters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI happened to find in the surgeon-general’s library a rare book:\r\nMoricheau Beaupré, A Treatise on the Effects and Properties of Cold,\r\nwith a Sketch, Historical and Medical, of the Russian Campaign.\r\nTranslated by John Clendining, with appendix, xviii, 375 pp. 8vo.,\r\nEdinburgh, Maclachnan and Stewart, 1826.\r\n\r\nThis most valuable book is not mentioned in any of the numerous\r\npublications on the medical history of the Russian campaign of Napoleon\r\nwhich I examined, and I shall now give an extract of what Beaupré\r\nwrites on the Effects of Cold in General:\r\n\r\nDistant expeditions, immaterial whether in cold or warm countries, with\r\nextremes of temperature, are always disadvantageous and must cause\r\ngreat sacrifice of life, not only on account of the untried influence\r\nof extreme temperatures on individuals born in other climates, but also\r\non account of the fatigues inseparable from traversing long distances,\r\nof an irregular life, of a multiplicity of events and circumstances\r\nimpossible to foresee, or which at least had not been foreseen, and\r\nwhich operate very unfavorably, morally and physically, on military\r\npersons. The expedition of the French army into Russia offers a sad\r\nproof of this truth, but history has recorded similar experiences. The\r\narmy of Alexander the Great suffered frightfully from cold on two\r\noccasions: first, when that ambitious conqueror involved himself amid\r\nsnows, in savage and barbarous regions of northern Asia before reaching\r\nthe Caucasus; the second time, when, after having crossed these\r\nmountains, he passed the Tanais to subdue the Scythians, and the\r\nsoldiers were oppressed with thirst, hunger, fatigue, and despair, so\r\nthat a great number died on the road, or lost their feet from\r\ncongelation; the cold seizing them, it benumbed their hands, and they\r\nfell at full length on the snow to rise no more. The best means they\r\nknew, says Q. Curtius, to escape that mortal numbness, was not to stop,\r\nbut to force themselves to keep marching, or else to light great fires\r\nat intervals. Charles XII, a great warrior alike rash and unreflecting,\r\nin 1707 penetrated into Russia and persisted in his determination of\r\nmarching to Moscow despite the wise advice given him to retire into\r\nPoland. The winter was so severe and the cold so intense that the\r\nSwedes and Russians could scarcely hold their arms. He saw part of his\r\narmy perish before his eyes, of cold, hunger, and misery, amid the\r\ndesert and icy steppes of the Ukraine. If he had reached Moscow, it is\r\nprobable that the Russians would have set him at bay, and that his\r\narmy, forced to retire, would have experienced the same fate as the\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nIn the retreat of Prague in 1742 the French army, commanded by Marshal\r\nBelle-Isle, little accustomed to a winter campaign, was forced to\r\ntraverse impracticable defiles across mountains and ravines covered\r\nwith snow. In ten days 4 thousand men perished of cold and misery; food\r\nand clothing were deficient, the soldiers died in anguish and despair,\r\nand a great many of the officers and soldiers had their noses, feet and\r\nhands frozen. The Russians regard the winter of 1812 as one of the most\r\nrigorous of which they have any record; it was intensely felt through\r\nall Russia, even in the most southerly parts. As a proof of this fact\r\nthe Tartars of the Crimea mentioned to Beaupré the behavior of the\r\ngreat and little bustard, which annually at that season of the year\r\nquit the plain for protection against the cold and migrate to the\r\nsouthern part of that peninsula toward the coasts. But during that\r\nwinter they were benumbed by the cold and dropped on the snow, so that\r\na great many of them were caught. In the low hills, in the spring of\r\n1813, the ground in some places was covered with the remains of those\r\nbirds entire.\r\n\r\nOf the effects of cold in general Beaupré says that soldiers who are\r\nrarely provided with certain articles of dress suitable for winter,\r\nwhose caps do not entirely protect the lateral and superior parts of\r\nthe head, and who often suffer from cold in bivouacs, are very liable\r\nto have ears and fingers seized on by asphyxia and mortification.\r\nTroopers who remain several days without taking off their boots, and\r\nwhose usual posture on horseback contributes to benumb the extremities,\r\noften have their toes and feet frozen without suspecting it.\r\n\r\nCold produces fatal effects above as well as below the freezing point.\r\nA continued moderate cold has the same consequences as a severe cold of\r\nshort duration. When very intense, as in the north, it sometimes acts\r\non the organism so briskly as to depress and destroy its powers with\r\nastonishing rapidity. As the action of cold is most frequently slow and\r\ndeath does not take place until after several hours’ exposure, the\r\ncontraction that diminishes the caliber of the vessels more and more\r\ndeeply, repels the blood toward the cavities of the head, chest, and\r\nabdomen; it causes, in the circulation of the lungs, and in that of the\r\nvenous system of the head, an embarrassment that disturbs the function\r\nof the brain and concurs to produce somnolence. The probability of this\r\nexplanation is strengthened by the flowing of the blood from the nose\r\nto the ears, spontaneous haemoptysis, also by preternatural redness of\r\nthe viscera, engorgements of the cerebral vessel, and bloody effusion,\r\nall of which conditions have been found after death.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that in spite of every possible means of congestion or\r\neffusion within the cranium, constant and forced motion is necessary\r\nfor the foot soldier to save him from surprise. The horseman must\r\ndismount as quickly as possible and constrain himself to walk.\r\nCommanders of divisions should not order halts in winter, and they\r\nshould take care that the men do not lag behind on the march. Necessary\r\nabove all are gaiety, courage, and perseverance of the mind; these\r\nqualities are the surest means of escaping danger. He who has the\r\nmisfortune of being alone, inevitably perishes.\r\n\r\nIn Siberia, the Russian soldiers, to protect themselves from the action\r\nof the cold, cover their noses and ears with greased paper. Fatty\r\nmatters seem to have the power of protecting from cold, or at least of\r\ngreatly diminishing its action. The Laplander and the Samoiede anoint\r\ntheir skin with rancid fish oil, and thus expose themselves in the\r\nmountains to a temperature of -36 deg. Reaumur, or 50 deg. below zero\r\nFahrenheit. Xenophon, during the retreat of the 10 thousand, ordered\r\nall his soldiers to grease those parts that were exposed to the air. If\r\nthis remedy could have been employed, says Beaupré, on the retreat from\r\nMoscow, it is probable that it would have prevented more than one\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nMost of those who escaped the danger of the cold ultimately fell sick.\r\nIn 1813 a number of soldiers, more or less seriously injured by cold,\r\nfilled the hospitals of Poland, Prussia, and other parts of Germany.\r\nFrom the shores of the Niemen to the banks of the Rhine it was easy to\r\nrecognize those persons who constituted the remainder of an army\r\nimmolated by cold and misery the most appalling. Many, not yet arrived\r\nat the limit of their sufferings, distributed themselves in the\r\nhospitals on this side of the Rhine, and even as far as the south of\r\nFrance, where they came to undergo various extirpations, incisions, and\r\namputations, necessitated by the physical disorder so often inseparable\r\nfrom profound gangraene.\r\n\r\nMutilation of hands and feet, loss of the nose, of an ear, weakness of\r\nsight, deafness, complete or incomplete, neuralgy, rheumatism, palsies,\r\nchronic diarrhoea, pectoral affections, recall still more strongly the\r\nhorrors of this campaign to those who bear such painful mementos.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut now let us return to the dissertation of von Scherer which gives\r\nthe most graphic and complete description of the effect of cold.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Borodino, on September 5th. and 7th., the army\r\nmarched to Moscow and arrived there on September 11th., exhausted to\r\nthe highest degree from hunger and misery. The number of\r\nWuerttembergians suffering from dysentery was very large. A hospital\r\nwas organized for them in a sugar refinery outside of Moscow. Many died\r\nhere, but the greater number was left to its fate during the retreat of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nThe quarters at Moscow until October 19th. improved the condition of\r\nthe army very little. Devoured by hunger, in want of all necessities,\r\nthe army had arrived. The terrible fire of the immense city had greatly\r\nreduced the hope for comfortable winter quarters. Although the eatables\r\nwhich had been saved from the fire were distributed among the soldiers\r\nwho, during the weeks of their sojourn, had wine, tea, coffee, meat,\r\nand bread, all wholesome and plentiful, yet dysentery continued and in\r\nmost patients had assumed a typhoid[1] character. Besides, real typhus\r\nhad now made its appearance in the army and, spreading rapidly through\r\ninfection, caused great loss of life and brought the misery to a\r\nclimax. The great number of the sick, crowded together in unfit\r\nquarters; the stench of the innumerable unburied and putrefying\r\ncadavers of men and animals in the streets of Moscow, among them the\r\ncorpses of several thousand Russians who had been taken prisoners and\r\nthen massacred, not to speak of the putrefying cadavers on the\r\nbattlefields and roads over which the army had marched, all this had\r\nfinally developed into a pest-like typhus.\r\n\r\n [1] The word typhoid means “resembling typhus,” and in Europe this\r\n term is correctly employed to designate a somnolent or other general\r\n condition in all kinds of feverish diseases which remind one of typhus\r\n symptoms. What English and American physicians call typhus or typhus\r\n fever is known to European physicians under the name of exanthematic\r\n or petechial typhus, indicating a symptom by which it is distinguished\r\n from abdominal typhus.\r\n\r\nAfter the retreat from Moscow had been decided upon, many thousands of\r\nthe sick were sent ahead on wagons under strong guards. These wagons\r\ntook the shortest road to Borodino, while the army took the road to\r\nKaluga. Several thousand typhus patients were left in Moscow, all of\r\nwhom died, with the exception of a few, according to later information.\r\nMany of those who, although suffering from typhus, had retained\r\nstrength enough to have themselves transported on the wagons, recovered\r\non the way, later to become victims of the cold.\r\n\r\nWeakened in body and mind, the army left Moscow on October 18th. and\r\n19th. The weather was clear, the nights were cold, when they proceeded\r\nin forced marches on the road to Kaluga. Near Maloijorolawez the enemy\r\nattempted to bar the way, and an obstinate engagement developed during\r\nwhich the French cavalry suffered severely.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the Russian battle line was broken, and the way was open,\r\nbut the French army had received its death-blow.\r\n\r\nThe order which thus far had kept the army was shaken, and disorder of\r\nall kinds commenced.\r\n\r\nThe retreat now continued in the direction of Borodino, Ghjat, and\r\nWiasma, the same road which had been followed on the march toward\r\nMoscow, a road which was laid waste and entirely deserted.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, in view of the helplessness which manifested itself, gave\r\nup all hope and with dismay looked into a terrible future.\r\n\r\nEverywhere surrounded by the enemy who attacked vehemently, the\r\nsoldiers were forced to remain in their ranks on the highway; whoever\r\nstraggled was lost—either killed or made prisoner of war.\r\n\r\nOn the immense tract of land extending from Moscow to Wilna during a\r\nmarch of several days, not a single inhabitant, not a head of cattle,\r\nwas to be seen, only cities and villages burnt and in ruins. The misery\r\nincreased from day to day. What little of provisions had been taken\r\nalong from Moscow was lost, together with the wagons, on the flight\r\nafter the engagement of Maloijorolawez, and this happened, as we have\r\nseen, before the army reached Borodino; the rations which the\r\nindividual soldier had with him were consumed during the first few\r\ndays, and thus a complete want made itself felt. The horses, receiving\r\nno food, fell in great numbers from exhaustion and starvation; cannon\r\nand innumerable wagons, for want of means to transport them, had to be\r\ndestroyed and left behind.\r\n\r\nFrom the last days of October until mid-December, at which time the\r\narmy arrived at Wilna, horse meat was the only food of the soldiers;\r\nmany could not obtain even this, and they died from starvation before\r\nthe intense cold weather set in. The meat which the soldiers ate was\r\neither that of exhausted and sick horses which had not been able to\r\nwalk any further, or of such as had been lying dead on the road for\r\nsome time. With the greatest greed and a beastly rage the men threw\r\nthemselves on the dead animals; they fought without distinction of rank\r\nand with a disregard of all military discipline—officers and privates\r\nalike—for the possession of the best liked parts of the dead animal—the\r\nbrain, the heart, and the liver. The weakest had to be contented with\r\nany part. Many devoured the meat raw, others pierced it with the\r\nbayonet, roasted it at the camp fire and ate it without anything else,\r\noften with great relish.\r\n\r\nSuch was the sad condition when the setting in of extreme cold weather\r\nbrought the misery—the horrors—to a climax.\r\n\r\nDuring the last days of October, when the army had scarcely reached\r\nBorodino, cold winds blew from the North.\r\n\r\nThe first snowfall was on October 26th., and the snow made the march of\r\nthe enfeebled army difficult in the extreme.\r\n\r\nFrom that date on the cold increased daily, and the camping over night\r\nwas terrible; the extremities of those who had no chance to protect\r\nthemselves with clothes nor to come near the campfire became frozen.\r\n\r\nDuring the first days of November the thermometer had fallen to -12\r\nReaumur (+4 Fahrenheit).\r\n\r\nDerangements of mind were the first pernicious effects of the low\r\ntemperature that were noticed.\r\n\r\nThe first effect on the brain in the strong and healthy ones, as well\r\nas in the others, was loss of memory.\r\n\r\nVon Scherer noticed that, with the beginning of the cold weather, many\r\ncould not remember the names of the best known, the everyday things,\r\nnot even the eagerly longed for eatables could they name, or name\r\ncorrectly; many forgot their own names and were no longer able to\r\nrecognize their nearest comrades and friends. Others had become\r\ncompletely feebleminded, their whole expression was that of stupidity.\r\nAnd those of a stronger constitution, who had resisted the effects of\r\ncold on body and mind, became deeply horrified on observing, in\r\naddition to their own sufferings, how the mental faculties of the best\r\nmen, hitherto of strong will power, had become impaired, and how these\r\nunfortunates sooner or later, yet gradually, with lucid intervals of a\r\nfew moments’ duration, invariably became completely insane.\r\n\r\nThe intense cold enfeebled, first of all, the brain of those whose\r\nhealth had already suffered, especially of those who had had dysentery,\r\nbut soon, while the cold increased daily, its pernicious effect was\r\nnoticed in all.\r\n\r\nThe internal vessels, especially those of the brain and the lungs, in\r\nmany became congested to such a degree that all vital activity was\r\nparalyzed.\r\n\r\nOn necropsy, these vessels of the brain and lungs and the right heart\r\nwere found to be bloated and stretched; in one case the different\r\nvessels of the brain were torn and quite an amount of blood was effused\r\nbetween the meninges and the brain, in most cases more or less serum\r\nhad collected in the cavities.\r\n\r\nThe corpses were white as snow, while the central organs in every case\r\nwere hyperaemic.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, while the cold was still tolerable, the effect of the\r\nhumors from the surface of the body to the central organs had caused\r\nonly a slight derangement of the functions of these organs, like\r\ndyspnoea, mental weakness, in some more or less indifference, a\r\ndisregard of their surroundings; in short, all those symptoms of what\r\nwas called at that time “Russian simpleton.”\r\n\r\nNow all actions of the afflicted manifested mental paralysis and the\r\nhighest degree of apathy.\r\n\r\nThis condition resembles that of extreme old age, when mind and body\r\nreturn to the state of childhood.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of those suffering from intense cold were shriveled and\r\nwrinkled. Men formerly models of bodily and mental strength, hardened\r\nin war, now staggered along, leaning on a stick, wailing and lamenting\r\nchildlike, begging for a piece of bread, and if something to eat was\r\ngiven to them they burst out in really childish joy, not seldom\r\nshedding tears.\r\n\r\nThe faces of these unfortunates were deadly pale, the features\r\nstrangely distorted. Lads resembled men of 80 years of age and\r\npresented a cretin-like appearance; the lips were bluish, the eyes\r\ndull, without luster, and constantly lachrymal; the veins very small,\r\nscarcely visible; the extremities cold; the pulse could not be felt,\r\nneither at the radius nor at the temple bone, somnolency was general.\r\n\r\nOften it happened that the moment they sank to the ground the lower\r\nextremities became paralyzed; soon after that, a few drops of blood\r\nfrom the nose indicated the moribund condition.\r\n\r\nSevered were all bonds of brotherly love, extinguished all human\r\nfeeling toward those who, from exhaustion, had fallen on the road.\r\n\r\nMany men, among them his former best comrades and even relatives, would\r\nfall upon such an unfortunate one to divest him of his clothing and\r\nother belongings, to leave him naked on the snow, inevitably to die.\r\n\r\nThe impulse of self-preservation overmastered everything in them.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of November, and more so during the first days\r\nof December, especially on the 8th., 9th., and 10th., when the army\r\narrived at Wilna, the cold had reached the lowest degree; during the\r\nnight from December 9th. to December 10th. the thermometer showed -32 R\r\n(-40 F.). The cold air caused severe pain in the eyes, resembling that\r\nof strong pressure. The eyes, weakened by the constant sight of snow,\r\nsuffered greatly under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nMany were blinded to such an extent that they could not see one step\r\nforward, could recognize nothing and had to find their way, like the\r\nblind in general, with the aid of a stick. Many of these fell during\r\nthe march and became stiffened at once.\r\n\r\nDuring this period von Scherer noticed that those who had been\r\nsuffering very much from cold would die quickly when they had fallen to\r\nthe frozen, ice-covered ground; the shaking due to the fall probably\r\ncausing injury to the spinal cord, resulting in sudden general\r\nparalysis of the lower extremities, the bladder and the intestinal\r\ntract being affected to the extent of an involuntary voiding of urine\r\nand feces.\r\n\r\nSurgeon-major von Keller stated to von Scherer the following case: “I\r\nwas lying near Wilna, it was during the first days of December, during\r\none of the coldest nights, together with several German officers, on\r\nthe road close to a camp fire, when a military servant approached us\r\nasking permission to bring his master, a French officer of the guards,\r\nto our fire.\r\n\r\n“This permission was willingly granted, and two soldiers of the guard\r\nbrought a tall and strong man of about thirty years of age whom they\r\nplaced on the ground between themselves.\r\n\r\n“When the Frenchman learned of the presence of a surgeon he narrated\r\nthat something quite extraordinary had happened to him.\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding the great general misery, he had thus far been\r\ncheerful and well, but half an hour previous his feet had stiffened and\r\nhe had been unable to walk, and now he had no longer any sensation from\r\nthe toes up the legs.\r\n\r\n“I examined him and found that his feet were completely stiff, white\r\nlike marble, and ice cold.\r\n\r\n“The officer was well dressed and, notwithstanding his pitiful\r\ncondition, more cheerful than myself and my comrades.\r\n\r\n“Soon he felt a strong desire to urinate, but was unable to do so.\r\n\r\n“With great relish he ate a large piece of horse flesh which had been\r\nroasted at the fire, but soon complained of great illness.\r\n\r\n“His cheerfulness changed suddenly to a sensation of great distress.\r\nIschuria persisted for several hours and caused him great pain; later\r\non during the night, he involuntarily voided feces and a large amount\r\nof urine. He slept a great deal, the breathing was free, but at dawn he\r\nfell into a helpless condition, and, at daybreak, before we had left\r\nthe fire, this strong man, who eight to ten hours before had been in\r\ngood health, died.”\r\n\r\nMost excellent and ingenious men in the prime of manhood all suffered\r\nmore or less from the cold; with the exception of a few cases, the\r\nsenses of all were, if not entirely deranged, at least weakened. The\r\nlongest and sometimes complete resistance to the cold was offered by\r\nthose who had always been of a cheerful disposition, especially those\r\nwho had not become discouraged by the great privations and hardships,\r\nwho ate horse flesh with relish and who in general had adapted\r\nthemselves to circumstances.\r\n\r\nOne of the Wuerttembergian officers, a man of considerable military\r\nknowledge and experience, was attacked, a few days before reaching\r\nWilna, with so pronounced a loss of sensation that he only vegetated,\r\nmoving along in the column like a machine.\r\n\r\nHe had no bodily sickness, no fever, was fairly well in strength, had\r\nnever or rarely been in want, but his whole sensory system was\r\nseriously affected by the cold.\r\n\r\nVon Scherer saw him, after he arrived at an inn in Wilna, somewhat\r\nrecovered by warmth and food, but acting childishly.\r\n\r\nWhile he ate the food placed before him he would make terrible\r\ngrimaces, crying or laughing for minutes at a time.\r\n\r\nHis constitution badly shaken, but gradually improving, he returned\r\nhome, and it took a long time before he recovered completely.\r\n\r\nAll traces of his sickness disappeared finally, and as active as ever\r\nhe attended his former duties.\r\n\r\nAnother officer, with whom von Scherer traveled a few days between\r\nKrasnoe and Orscha, had not until then suffered any real want.\r\n\r\nHe rode in a well-closed carriage drawn by strong horses, had two\r\nsoldiers as servants, was well dressed and suffered, therefore, much\r\nless than others. Especially was he well protected from the cold, yet\r\nthis had a severe effect on him. His mind became deranged, he did not\r\nrecognize von Scherer with whom he had been on intimate terms for\r\nyears, nor could he call either of his servants by name; he would\r\nconstantly run alongside the carriage, insisting that it belonged to\r\nthe French emperor and that he was entrusted to guard his majesty.\r\n\r\nOnly when he had fallen asleep, or by force, was von Scherer able, with\r\nthe aid of the two servants, to place him in the carriage.\r\n\r\nHis mental condition became worse every day; von Scherer had to leave\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThis officer reached Wilna, where he was made a prisoner and soon died\r\nin captivity.\r\n\r\nMany more cases resembling these two were observed by von Scherer, and\r\nother army surgeons reported instances of the like effect of cold.\r\n\r\nSurgeon General von Schmetter had remained with the Crown Prince of\r\nWuerttemberg in Wilna, while the army marched to Moscow.\r\n\r\nHe reported many cases of unfortunates whom he had received in the\r\nhospital in Wilna, who by cold and misery of all kinds had been reduced\r\nto a pitiful state—men formerly of a vigorous constitution presented a\r\npuerile appearance and had become demented.\r\n\r\nA cavalryman of the regiment Duke Louis, who, during February, 1813,\r\nhad been admitted into the hospital of Wilna, suffering from quiet\r\nmania without being feverish, was constantly searching for something.\r\n\r\nHands and feet had been frozen. He became ill with typhus and was more\r\nor less delirious for two weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter the severity of the sickness had abated he again began to search\r\nanxiously for something, and after the fever had left him he explained\r\nthat thirty thousand florins, which he had brought with him to the\r\nhospital, had been taken away.\r\n\r\nIt was learned that this cavalryman had been sent, together with other\r\ncomrades, with dispatches to Murat; that these men had defended Murat\r\nwith great bravery when he was in danger in the battle of Borodino.\r\n\r\nMurat, in recognition of their bravery, which had saved him, had given\r\nthem a wagon with gold, which they were to divide among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe share of each of these cavalrymen amounted to over thirty thousand\r\nflorins, and the gold was transported on four horses, but these horses,\r\nfor want of food, had broken down under the load, and the gold had\r\nfallen into the hands of the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nThe patient became quite ecstatic when, during his convalescence, he\r\nwas told that he had brought no gold with him into the hospital; only\r\ngradually could he be made to understand that he had been mistaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe said, however, that he could not recollect having been robbed during\r\nthe retreat, although this fact had been testified to by two witnesses.\r\n\r\nTwo years after he had left the hospital and quitted the military\r\nservice, when he was perfectly well and vigorous again, he recollected\r\nthat on a very cold day he had been taken prisoner by Cossacks, who had\r\nleft him, naked and unconscious, in the snow.\r\n\r\nHe could not remember how and when he had come into the hospital.\r\nNotwithstanding all these later recollections, he still imagined from\r\ntime to time that he had brought the gold with him into the hospital.\r\n\r\nSurgeon General von Schmetter reported further the case of a cavalryman\r\nof the King’s regiment who, like many others, had returned from Russia\r\nin an imbecile condition.\r\n\r\nHe spoke alternately, or mixed up, Polish, Russian, and German; he had\r\nto be fed like a child, could not remember his name or the name of his\r\nnative place, and died from exhaustion eight days after admittance into\r\nthe hospital.\r\n\r\nOn necropsy of the quite wrinkled body, the cerebral vessels were found\r\nfull of blood, the ventricles full of serum. On the surface of the\r\nbrain between the latter and the meninges were found several larger and\r\nsmaller sacs filled with lymph, the spinal canal full of serum; in the\r\nspinal cord plain traces of inflammation. In the lungs there was much\r\ndark coagulated blood, and likewise in the vena cava; in the stomach\r\nand intestines, many cicatrices; the mesenteric glands and pancreas\r\nwere much degenerated and filled with pus; the rectum showed many\r\ncicatrices and several ulcers.\r\n\r\nIn the hospital of Mergentheim eight necropsies were held on corpses of\r\nsoldiers who had returned mentally affected in consequence of exposure\r\nto extreme cold. Similar conditions had presented themselves in all\r\nthese cases.\r\n\r\nSurgeon General von Kohlreuter attended an infantry officer who had\r\narrived at Inorawlow, in Poland, where the remainder of the\r\nWuerttembergian corps had rallied. He showed no special sickness, had\r\nno fever, but fell into complete apathy. For a long time he had great\r\nweakness of mind, but recovered completely in the end.\r\n\r\nOf another patient of this kind, an officer of the general staff, who\r\nhad been treated after that fatal retreat from Moscow, von Kohlreuter\r\nreports that later on he recovered completely from the mental\r\nderangement, but died on his return, near the borders of Saxony, from\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nAn infantry officer became mentally deranged sometime after he had\r\nreturned to his home; it took a long time, but finally he recovered\r\nwithout special medical aid.\r\n\r\nRecovery of such cases was accomplished by time, a mild climate, by\r\nsocial intercourse, and good nourishment; many of them, on the way\r\nthrough Germany and before they reached their own home, had completely\r\nregained their mental faculties, and only in a small number of cases\r\ndid it take a long period of time and medication before recovery was\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nThe effect of intense cold on wounds was very severe: Violent\r\ninflammation, enormous swelling, gangraene—the latter often due to the\r\nimpossibility of proper care. Larger wounds sometimes could not be\r\ndressed on the retreat, and while the cold weather lasted gangraene and\r\ndeath followed in quick succession. The effect of cold was noticed also\r\non wounds which had healed and cicatrized.\r\n\r\nVon Happrecht, an officer of the regiment Duke Louis, had been wounded\r\nin the foot by a cannon ball in the battle of Borodino on September\r\n7th., and Surgeon-General von Kohlreuter had amputated it. Fairly\r\nstrong and cheerful, this officer arrived safely at the Beresina. The\r\npassage over this river was, as is well known, very dangerous, and von\r\nHapprecht had to wait, exposed to cold, for some time before he could\r\ncross. Soon after traversing on horseback he felt as if he had lost the\r\nstump; he had no sensation in the leg the foot of which had been\r\namputated. Unfortunately, he approached a fire to warm himself and felt\r\na severe pain in the stump; extensive inflammation, with swelling, set\r\nin; gangraene followed and, notwithstanding most skillful attendance,\r\nhe died soon after his arrival at Wilna.\r\n\r\nSo far von Scherer. Beaupré, speaking of his own observations of the\r\neffects of extreme cold, gives the following account:\r\n\r\nSoldiers unable to go further fell and resigned themselves to death, in\r\nthat frightful state of despair which is caused by the total loss of\r\nmoral and physical force, which was aggravated to the utmost by the\r\nsight of their comrades stretched lifeless on the snow. During a\r\nretreat so precipitate and fatal, in a country deprived of its\r\nresources, amid disorder and confusion, the sad physician was forced to\r\nremain an astonished spectator of evils he could not arrest, to which\r\nhe could apply no remedy. The state of matters remarkably affected the\r\nmoral powers. The consternation was general. Fear of not escaping the\r\ndanger was very naturally allied with the desperate idea of seeing\r\none’s country no more. None could flatter himself that his courage and\r\nstrength would suffice so that he would be able to withstand privations\r\nand sufferings beyond human endurance. Italians, Portuguese, Spaniards,\r\nthose from the temperate and southern parts of France, obliged to brave\r\nan austere climate unknown to them, directed their thoughts toward\r\ntheir country and with good reasons regretted the beauty of the heaven,\r\nthe softness of the air of the regions of their birth.\r\n\r\nNostalgia was common…. The army was but three days from Smolensk when\r\nthe heavens became dark, and snow began to fall in great flakes, in\r\nsuch a quantity that the air was obscured. The cold was then felt with\r\nextreme severity; the northern wind blew impetuously into the faces of\r\nthe soldiers and incommoded many who were no longer able to see. They\r\nstrayed, fell into the snow—above all, when night surprised them—and\r\nthus miserably perished.\r\n\r\nDisbanded regiments were reduced to almost nothing by the loss of men\r\ncontinually left behind either on the roads or in the bivouacs.\r\n\r\nOf the days of Smolensk he writes: In the streets one met with none but\r\nsick and wounded men asking for hospitals, soldiers of every sort, of\r\nevery nation, going and coming, some of them trying to find a place\r\nwhere provisions were sold or distributed; others taciturn, incapable\r\nof any effort, absorbed by grief, half dead with cold, awaiting their\r\nlast hour. On all sides there were complaints and groans, dead and\r\ndying soldiers, all of which presented a picture that was still further\r\ndarkened by the ruinous aspect of the city…. At Smolensk Beaupré\r\nhimself had a narrow escape from freezing to death; he narrates: During\r\nthe frightful night when we left Smolensk I felt much harassed; toward\r\n5 in the morning, a feeling of lassitude impelled me to stop and rest.\r\nI sat down on the trunk of a birch, beside eight frozen corpses, and\r\nsoon experienced an inclination to sleep, to which I yielded the more\r\nwillingly as at that moment it seemed delicious. Fortunately I was\r\naroused from that incipient somnolency—which infallibly would have\r\nbrought on torpor—by the cries and oaths of two soldiers who were\r\nviolently striking a poor exhausted horse that had fallen down.\r\n\r\nI emerged from that state with a sort of shock.\r\n\r\nThe sight of what was beside me strongly recalled to my mind the danger\r\nto which I exposed myself; I took a little brandy and started to run to\r\nremove the numbness of my legs, the coldness and insensibility of which\r\nwere as if they had been immersed in an iced bath.\r\n\r\nHe then describes his experience in similar cases: It happened three or\r\nfour times that I assisted some of those unfortunates who had just\r\nfallen and began to doze, to rise again and endeavored to keep them in\r\nmotion after having given them a little sweetened brandy.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain; they could neither advance nor support themselves, and\r\nthey fell again in the same place, where of necessity they had to be\r\nabandoned to their unhappy lot. Their pulse was small and\r\nimperceptible. Respiration, infrequent and scarcely sensible in some,\r\nwas attended in others by complaints and groans. Sometimes the eyes\r\nwere open, fixed, dull, wild, and the brain was seized by a quiet\r\ndelirium; in other instances the eyes were red and manifested a\r\ntransient excitement of the brain; there was marked delirium in these\r\ncases. Some stammered incoherent words, others had a reserved and\r\nconvulsive cough. In some blood flowed from the nose and ears; they\r\nagitated their limbs as if groping. (This description of Beaupré\r\ncomplements the account given by von Scherer.)\r\n\r\nMany had their hands, feet, and ears frozen. A great many were mortally\r\nstricken when obliged to stop to relieve nature; the arrival of that\r\ndreaded moment was in fact very embarrassing, on account of the danger\r\nof exposing oneself to the air as well as owing to the numbness of the\r\nfingers which rendered them unable to readjust the clothes….\r\n\r\nAnd they traveled day and night, often without knowing where they were.\r\n\r\nUltimately they were obliged to stop, and, complaining, shivering,\r\nforced to lie down in the woods, on the roads, in ditches, at the\r\nbottom of ravines, often without fire, because they had no wood at\r\nhand, nor strength enough to go and cut some in the vicinity; if they\r\nsucceeded in lighting one, they warmed themselves as they could, and\r\nfell asleep without delay.\r\n\r\nThe first hours of sleep were delightful, but, alas! they were merely\r\nthe deceitful precursor of death that was waiting for them.\r\n\r\nThe fire at length became extinct for want of attention or owing to the\r\ngreat blast. Instead of finding safety in the sweets of sleep, they\r\nwere seized and benumbed by cold, and never saw daylight again….\r\n\r\nI have seen them sad, pale, despairing, without arms, staggering,\r\nscarce able to sustain themselves, their heads hanging to the right or\r\nleft, their extremities contracted, setting their feet on the coals,\r\nlying down on hot cinders, or falling into the fire, which they sought\r\nmechanically, as if by instinct.\r\n\r\nOthers apparently less feeble, and resolved not to allow themselves to\r\nbe depressed by misfortune, rallied their powers to avoid sinking; but\r\noften they quitted one place only to perish in another.\r\n\r\nAlong the road, in the adjacent ditches and fields, were perceived\r\nhuman carcasses, heaped up and lying at random in fives, tens, fifteens\r\nand twenties, of such as had perished during the night, which was\r\nalways more murderous than the day.\r\n\r\nWhen no longer able to continue walking, having neither strength nor\r\nwill power, they fell on their knees.\r\n\r\nThe muscles of the trunk were the last to lose the power of\r\ncontraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “And never saw daylight again.”]\r\n\r\nMany of those unfortunates remained for some time in that posture\r\ncontending with death.\r\n\r\nOnce fallen it was impossible for them, even with their utmost efforts,\r\nto rise again. The danger of stopping had been universally observed;\r\nbut, alas! presence of mind and firm determination did not always\r\nsuffice to ward off mortal attacks made from all directions upon one\r\nmiserable life!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWIASMA\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half from Wiasma the enemy appeared to the left of\r\nthe road, and his fire happened to strike the midst of the tail of the\r\narmy, composed of disbanded soldiers without arms, with wounded and\r\nsick among them, and women and children. Every artillery discharge of\r\nthe Russians caused frightful cries and a frightful commotion in the\r\nhelpless mass.\r\n\r\nAnd the rear guard, in trying to make them advance, ill-treated them,\r\nthe soldiers who had clung to the flag assumed the right to despise\r\nthose who, either voluntarily or under compulsion, had abandoned it.\r\n\r\nOf the old generals of Davout some had been killed, Friant was so\r\nseverely wounded that he could not be about, Compans had been wounded\r\nin the arm, Moraud in the head, but these two, the former with one arm\r\nin a sling, the other with a bandaged head, were on horseback,\r\nsurrounding the marshal commanding the first corps which had been\r\nreduced to 15 thousand from 20 thousand at Moshaisk, from 28 thousand\r\nin Moscow, and from 72 thousand crossing the Niemen. The remaining 15\r\nthousand were all old warriors whose iron constitution had triumphed.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Wiasma took place on the 2d. of November. The Russians\r\nunder Miloradovitch had 100 cannon, whereas the French under Ney,\r\nDavout, and the wounded generals named above, had only 40. This day\r\ncost the French 1,500 to 1,800 men in killed and wounded, and, as\r\nmentioned, these were of the oldest and best; the loss of the Russians\r\nwas twice that number, but their wounded were not lost, while it was\r\nimpossible to save a single one of the French, for the latter had no\r\nattendance at all; the cold being very severe it killed them, and those\r\nwho did not perish by the frost were put to death by the cruel,\r\nferocious Russian peasants.\r\n\r\nEntering Wiasma at night, nothing in the way of provisions was found;\r\nthe guard and the corps which had been there before the battle had\r\ndevoured everything. No provisions were left of those taken along from\r\nMoscow. The army passed a sombre and bitter cold night in a forest;\r\ngreat fires were lighted, horse meat was roasted, and the soldiers of\r\nPrince Eugene and of Marshal Davout, especially the latter who had been\r\non their feet for three days, slept profoundly around great camp-fires.\r\nDuring two weeks they had been on duty to cover the retreat and during\r\nthis time had lost more than one half of their number.\r\n\r\nNapoleon arrived at Dorogobouge on November 5th., the Prince Eugene on\r\nthe 6th., the other corps on the 7th. and 8th.\r\n\r\nUntil then the frost had been severe but not yet fatal. All of a\r\nsudden, on the 9th., the weather changed, and there was a terrible\r\nsnow-storm.\r\n\r\nOn their way to Moscow the regiments had traversed Poland during a\r\nsuffocating heat and had left their warm clothing in the magazines.\r\n\r\nSome soldiers had taken furs with them from Moscow, but had sold them\r\nto their officers.\r\n\r\nWell nourished, they could have stood the frost, but living on a little\r\nflour diluted with water, on horse meat roasted at the camp fire,\r\nsleeping on the ground without shelter, they suffered frightfully. We\r\nshall later on speak more in detail of the miserable clothing.\r\n\r\nThe first snow which had been falling after they had left Dorogobouge\r\nhad seriously increased the general misery. Except among the soldiers\r\nof the rear guard which had been commanded with inflexible firmness by\r\nDavout, and which was now led by Ney, the sense of duty began to be\r\nlost by almost all soldiers.\r\n\r\nAs we have learned, all the wounded had to be left to their fate, and\r\nsoldiers who had been charged to escort Russian prisoners relieved\r\nthemselves of their charge by shooting these prisoners dead.\r\n\r\nThe horses had not been shod in Russian fashion for traveling on the\r\nice. The army had come during the summer without any idea of returning\r\nduring the winter; the horses slipped on the ice, those of the\r\nartillery were too feeble to draw cannon even of small calibre, they\r\nwere beaten unmercifully until they perished; not only cannons and\r\nammunition had to be left, but the number of vehicles carrying\r\nnecessities of life diminished from day to day. The soldiers lived on\r\nthe fallen horses; when night came the dead animals were cut to pieces\r\nby means of the sabre, huge portions were roasted at immense fires, the\r\nmen devoured them and went to sleep around the fires. If the Cossacks\r\ndid not disturb their dearly bought sleep the men would awake; some\r\nhalf burnt, others finding themselves lying in the mud which had formed\r\naround them, and many would not rise any more. General von Kerner, of\r\nthe Wuerttembergian troops had slept in a barn during the night from\r\nNovember 7th. to November 8th. Coming out at daybreak he saw his men in\r\nthe plain as they had lain down around a fire the evening before,\r\nfrozen and dead. The survivors would depart, hardly glancing at the\r\nunfortunates who had died or were dying, and for whom they could do\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe snow would soon cover them, and small eminences marked the places\r\nwhere these brave soldiers had been sacrificed for a foolish\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIt was under these circumstances that Ney, the man of the greatest\r\nenergy and of a courage which could not be shaken by any kind of\r\nsuffering, took command of the rear guard, relieving Davout whose\r\ninflexible firmness and sense of honor and duty were not less admirable\r\nthan the excellent qualities of Ney. The bravest of the brave, as\r\nNapoleon had called Ney, had an iron constitution, he never seemed to\r\nbe tired nor suffering from any ailment; he passed the night without\r\nshelter, slept or did not sleep, ate or did not eat, without ever being\r\ndiscouraged; most of the time he was on his feet in the midst of his\r\nsoldiers; he did not find it beneath the dignity of a Marshal of\r\nFrance, when necessary, to gather 50 or 100 men about him and lead\r\nthem, like a simple captain of infantry, against the enemy under fire\r\nof musketry, calm, serene, believing himself invulnerable and being\r\napparently so indeed; he did not find it incompatible with his rank to\r\ntake up the musket of a soldier who had fallen and to fire at the enemy\r\nlike a private. There is a great painting in the gallery of Versailles\r\nrepresenting him in such an action. He had never been wounded in\r\nbattle. And this great hero was executed in the morning of December\r\n7th., 1815, in the garden of the Luxembourg.\r\n\r\nLouis XVIII, this miserable and insignificant man of legitimate royal\r\nblood who had never rendered any service to France, wanted revenge—Ney\r\nwas arrested and condemned by the Chamber of Peers after the marshals\r\nhad refused to condemn him. His wife pleaded in vain for his life, the\r\nking remained inflexible. Ney was simply shot by 12 poor soldiers\r\ncommanded for the execution. After the marshal had sunk down, an\r\nEnglishman suddenly rode up at a gallop and leaped over the fallen\r\nhero, to express the triumph of the victors. It was in as bad taste as\r\neverything that England contrived against Napoleon and his men.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] Brave men were condemned to deportation or were executed; derision\r\n and mocking of Napoleon’s generals was the order of the day.\r\n\r\nAmong the spectators there was also a Russian general in full uniform\r\nand on horseback. Tzar Alexander expelled him from the army after he\r\nhad heard of it.\r\n\r\nThe Bourbons commenced a tromocraty which was called, in contrast to\r\nthe terrorisms of the revolution, the white terror.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about the fantastic costume of Murat, but I do\r\nnot recollect having read the true explanation of it. All writers agree\r\nthat he was the bravest, the greatest cavalry general. As such he meant\r\nto be distinguished from far and near in the midst of the battle where\r\ndanger was greatest, so that the sight of his person, his exposure to\r\nthe enemy, should encourage and inspire his soldiers. He rode a very\r\nnoble white horse and wore a Polish kurtka of light blue velvet which\r\nreached down to the knees, embroidered with golden lace, dark red\r\nmameluke pantaloons with golden galloons, white gauntlets and a\r\nthree-cornered general’s hat with white plumes; the saddle was of red\r\nvelvet and a caparison of the same stuff, all embroidered with gold.\r\nThe neck of the king was bare, a large white scalloped collar fell over\r\nthe collar of the kurtka. A strong black full beard gave a martial\r\nexpression to his face with the fiery eyes and regular features.\r\nSometimes he wore a biretta with a diamond agraffe and a high plume of\r\nheron feathers. Very seldom he appeared in the uniform of a marshal.\r\n\r\nAnd this other great hero, who, like Ney, had never been wounded in\r\nbattle, was executed by order of the court of Naples on October 13th.,\r\n1815, in the hall of castle Pizzo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOP\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to give an idea of the great difficulties the soldiers had to\r\nface, and examples of their heroic behavior under trying circumstances,\r\nlet us relate the disaster of Vop.\r\n\r\nWhile Napoleon, with the imperial guard, the corps of Marshal Davout\r\nand a mass of stragglers, all escorted by Marshal Ney, was marching on\r\nthe road to Smolensk, Prince Eugene had taken the road to\r\nDoukhowtchina. The prince had with him 6 or 7 thousand men under arms,\r\nincluding the Italian guard, some Bavarian cavalry which still had\r\ntheir horses and their artillery mounted, and also many stragglers,\r\nwith these a number of families who had been following the Italian\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first day’s journey—it was on November 8th.—near the\r\ncastle Zazale, they hoped to find at this castle some provisions and an\r\nabode for the night. A great cold had set in, and when they came to a\r\nhill the road was so slippery that it was almost impossible to\r\nnegotiate the elevation with even the lightest load. Detaching horses\r\nfrom the pieces in order to double and treble the teams they succeeded\r\nin scaling the height with cannons of small calibre, but they were\r\nforced to abandon the larger ones.\r\n\r\nThe men being exhausted as well as the horses they felt humiliated at\r\nbeing obliged to leave their best pieces. While they had exerted\r\nthemselves with such sad results, Platow had followed them with his\r\nCossacks and light cannons mounted on sleighs and incessantly fired\r\ninto the French. The commander of the Italian artillery, General\r\nAnthouard, was severely wounded and was compelled to give up his\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nA gloomy night was passed at the castle Zazale.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 9th. they left at an early hour to cross the Vop,\r\na little rivulet during the summer but now quite a river, at least four\r\nfeet deep and full of mud and ice.\r\n\r\nThe pontooneers of Prince Eugene had gone ahead, working during the\r\nnight to construct a bridge, but frozen and hungry they had suspended\r\ntheir work for a few hours, to finish it after a short rest.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak those most anxious to cross went on the unfinished bridge\r\nwhich they thought was completed.\r\n\r\nA heavy mist prevented them from recognizing their error until the\r\nfirst ones fell into the icy water emitting piercing cries. Finally\r\nhorses and men waded through the water—some succeeded, other succumbed.\r\n\r\nIt would lead too far to give here a full description of the\r\ndistressing scenes, the difficulty of passing with artillery and the\r\nmostly vain attempts to bring over the baggage wagons. But, to cap the\r\nclimax, there arrived 3 or 4 thousand Cossacks shouting savagely. With\r\nthe greatest difficulty only was the rear guard able to keep them at a\r\ndistance so that they could not come near enough to make use of their\r\nlances. Their artillery, however, caused veritable desolation.\r\n\r\nAmong the poor fugitives from Moscow there were a number of Italian and\r\nFrench women; these unfortunates stood at the border of the river,\r\ncrying and embracing their children, but not daring to wade through it.\r\nBrave soldiers, full of humanity, took the little ones in their arms\r\nand passed with them, some repeating this two and three times, in order\r\nto bring all the children safely over. These desolate families, not\r\nbeing able to save their vehicles, lost with them the means of\r\nsubsistence brought from Moscow. All the baggage, the entire artillery\r\nwith the exception of seven or eight pieces, had been lost, and a\r\nthousand men had been killed by the fire of the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nThis dreadful event on the retreat from Moscow is called the disaster\r\nof Vop and was the precursor of another disaster of the same nature,\r\nbut a hundred times more frightful, the disaster of the Beresina.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was another cause of death of which we have not spoken yet: this\r\nwas the action of the heat at the campfires. Anxious to warm\r\nthemselves, most of the soldiers hastened to bring their limbs near the\r\nflame; but this sudden exposure to extreme heat, after having suffered\r\nfrom the other extreme—cold—was acting on the feeble circulation in the\r\ntissues and produced gangraene of the feet, the hands, even of the\r\nface, causing paralysis either partial, of the extremities, or general,\r\nof the whole body.\r\n\r\nOnly those were saved who had been able to keep up their circulation by\r\nmeans of hot drinks or other stimulants and who, noticing numbness, had\r\nrubbed the affected parts with snow. Those who did not or could not\r\nresort to these precautions found themselves paralyzed, or stricken\r\nwith sudden gangraene, in the morning when the camp broke up.\r\n\r\nThe hospitals of Koenigsberg admitted about 10 thousand soldiers of\r\nNapoleon’s army, only a small number of whom had been wounded, most of\r\nthem with frozen extremities, who had, as the physicians of that time\r\ncalled it, a pest, the fever of congelation which was terribly\r\ncontagious.\r\n\r\nThe heroic Larrey although exhausted from fatigue had come to these\r\nhospitals to take care of the sick, but he became infected with the\r\ncontagion himself and was taken sick.\r\n\r\nA great calamity was the want of shoes; we have seen that this was\r\nalready felt in Moscow, before they set out on the endless march over\r\nice and snow.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers had their feet wrapped in rags, pieces of felt or leather,\r\nand when a man had fallen on the road some of his comrades would cut\r\noff his feet and carry them to the next camp fire to remover the\r\nrags—for their own use.\r\n\r\nBut the general appearance of the emaciated soldiers with long beards,\r\nand faces blackened by the smoke of camp-fires, the body wrapped in\r\ndirty rags of wearing apparel brought from Moscow, was such that it was\r\ndifficult to recognize them as soldiers.\r\n\r\nAnd the vermin! Carpon, a surgeon-major of the grand army, in\r\ndescribing the days of Wilna which were almost as frightful as the\r\ndisaster of the Beresina, speaks on this subject. It is revolting.\r\nStrange to say, it is hardly ever mentioned in the medical history of\r\nwars, although every one who has been in the field is quite familiar\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nAt last I have found—in Holzhausen’s book—a description of the most\r\nrevolting lice plague (phtheiriasis) from which, according to his\r\nvalet, Constant, even the emperor was not exempted. As a matter of\r\ncourse under the circumstances—impossibility of bodily cleanliness—this\r\nvermin developed in a way which baffles description. Suckow, a\r\nWuerttembergian first lieutenant, speaks of it as causing intolerable\r\ndistress, disturbing the sleep at the campfire. Johann von Borcke\r\nbecame alarmed when he discovered that his whole body was eaten up by\r\nthese insects. A French colonel relates that in scratching himself he\r\ntore a piece of flesh from the neck, but that the pain caused by this\r\nwound produced a sensation of relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOLENSK\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the corps marched to Smolensk where they expected to reach the end\r\nof all their misery and to find repose, food, shelter; in fact, all\r\nthey were longing for.\r\n\r\nNapoleon entered the city with his guards and kept the rest of the\r\narmy, including the stragglers, out of doors until arrangements could\r\nhave been made for the regular distribution of rations and quarters.\r\nBut together with the stragglers the mass of the army became\r\nunmanageable and resorted to violence.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the guards were given the preference they broke out in\r\nrevolt, entered by force and pillaged the magazines. “The magazines are\r\npillaged!” was the general cry of terror and despair. Every one was\r\nrunning to grasp something to eat.\r\n\r\nFinally, something like order was established to save some of the\r\nprovisions for the corps of Prince Eugene and Marshal Ney who arrived\r\nafter fighting constantly to protect the city from the troops of the\r\nenemy. They received in their turn eatables and a little rest, not\r\nunder shelter but in the streets, where they were protected, not from\r\nthe frost, but from the enemy.\r\n\r\nThere were no longer any illusions. The army having hoped to find\r\nshelter and protection, subsistence, clothes and, above all, shoes, at\r\nSmolensk, they found nothing of all this and learned that they had to\r\nleave, perhaps the next day, to recommence the interminable march\r\nwithout abode for the night, without bread to eat and constantly\r\nfighting while exhausted, with the cruel certainty that if wounded they\r\nwould be the prey of wolves and vultures.\r\n\r\nThis prospect made them all desperate; they saw the abyss, and still\r\nthe worst was yet in store for them: Beresina and Wilna!\r\n\r\nNapoleon left Smolensk on November 14th. The cold had become more\r\nintense—21 deg. Reaumur (16 deg. below zero Fahrenheit)—this is the\r\nobservation of Larrey who had a thermometer attached to his coat; he\r\nwas the only one who kept a record of the temperature.\r\n\r\nThe cold killed a great many, and the road became covered with dead\r\nsoldiers resting under the snow.\r\n\r\nTo the eternal honor of the most glorious of all armies be it said that\r\nit was only at the time when the misery had surpassed all boundaries,\r\nwhen the soldiers had to camp on the icy ground with an empty stomach,\r\ntheir limbs paralyzed in mortal rigor, that the dissolution began.\r\n\r\nIt was even after the heroic battle of Wiasma that they fought day for\r\nday.\r\n\r\nIt was not the cold which caused the proud army to disband, but hunger.\r\n\r\nProvisions could nowhere be found; all horses perished, and with them\r\nthe possibility of transporting food and ammunition.\r\n\r\nAnd it is one thing to suffer cold and hunger, traveling under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, and another to suffer thus and at the same time being\r\nfollowed by the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBERESINA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the disaster of the Beresina it is necessary to\r\ncast a glance at the condition of Napoleon’s army at that time.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle at Krasnoe, Napoleon at Orscha, on November 19th.,\r\nhappy to have found a place of safety at last, with well furnished\r\nmagazines, made a new attempt to rally the army by means of a regular\r\ndistribution of rations. A detachment of excellent gendarmes had come\r\nfrom France and was employed to do police duty, to engage everybody,\r\neither by persuasion or by force, to join his corps. These brave men,\r\naccustomed to suppress disorder in the rear of the army, had never\r\nwitnessed anything like the condition with which they were obliged to\r\ndeal at this time. They were dismayed. All their efforts were in vain.\r\nThreats, promises of rations if the soldiers would fall in line, were\r\nof no avail whatever. The men, whether armed or not, thought it more\r\nconvenient, above all more safe, to care for themselves instead of\r\nagain taking up the yoke of honor, thereby taking the risk of being\r\nkilled, or wounded,—which amounted to the same thing—they would not\r\nthink of sacrificing their individual self for the sake of the whole.\r\nSome of the disbanded soldiers had retained their arms, but only to\r\ndefend themselves against the Cossacks and to be better able to maraud.\r\nThey lived from pillaging, taking advantage of the escort of the army,\r\nwithout rendering any service. [Illustration] In order to warm\r\nthemselves they would put fire to houses occupied by wounded soldiers,\r\nmany of whom perished in the flames in consequence. They had become\r\nreal ferocious beasts. Among these marauders were only very few old\r\nsoldiers, for most of the veterans remained with the flag until death.\r\n\r\nNapoleon addressed the guards, appealing to their sense of duty, saying\r\nthat they were the last to uphold military honor, that they, above all,\r\nhad to set the example to save the remainder of the army which was in\r\ndanger of complete dissolution; that if they, the guards, would become\r\nguilty, they would be more guilty than any of the other corps, because\r\nthey had no excuse to complain of neglect, for what few supplies had\r\nbeen at the disposal of the army, their wants had always been\r\nconsidered ahead of the rest of the army, that he could resort to\r\npunishments, could have shot the first of the old grenadiers who would\r\nleave the ranks, but that he preferred to rely on their virtue as\r\nwarriors to assure their devotedness. The grenadiers expressed their\r\nassent and gave promises of good conduct. All surviving old grenadiers\r\nremained in the ranks, not one of them had disbanded. Of the 6 thousand\r\nwho had crossed the Niemen, about 3,500 survived, the others had\r\nsuccumbed to fatigue or frost, very few had fallen in battle.\r\n\r\nThe disbanded soldiers of the rest of the army, having in view another\r\nlong march, with great sufferings to endure, were not disposed to\r\nchange their ways. They now needed a long rest, safety, and abundance,\r\nto make them recognize military discipline again. The order to\r\ndistribute rations among those who had rallied around the flag could\r\nnot be kept up for more than a few hours. The magazines were pillaged,\r\nas they had been pillaged at Smolensk. The forty-eight hours’ stay at\r\nOrscha was utilized for rest and to nourish a few men and the horses.\r\n\r\nIn these days Napoleon was as indefatigable as he ever had been as\r\nyoung Bonaparte. His proclamation of the 19th. did not remain quite\r\nunheeded even among the disbanded, but, on the march again, the nearer\r\nthey came to the Beresina the more pronounced became the lack of\r\ndiscipline. In the following description I avail myself of the\r\nclassical work of Thiers’ “Histoire du Consulat et de l’Empire.”\r\n\r\nThe only bridge over the Beresina, at Borisow, had been burned by the\r\nRussians. It was as by miracle that General Corbineau met a Polish\r\npeasant who indicated a place—near the village Studianka—where the\r\nBeresina could be forded by horses. Napoleon, informed of this fact on\r\nNovember 28th., at once ordered General Eblé to construct the bridge\r\nand on November 25th., at 1 o’clock in the morning, he issued orders to\r\nOudinot to have his corps ready for crossing the river. The moment had\r\narrived when the great engineer, the venerable General Eblé, was to\r\ncrown his career by an immortal service.\r\n\r\nHe had saved six cases containing tools, nails, clamps, and all kinds\r\nof iron pieces needed for the construction of trestle bridges. In his\r\nprofound foresight he had also taken along two wagon-loads of charcoal,\r\nand he had under his command 400 excellent pontooneers upon whom he\r\ncould reply absolutely.\r\n\r\nGeneral Eblé has been described as the model of an officer, on account\r\nof his imposing figure and his character.\r\n\r\nEblé and Larrey were the two men whom the whole army never ceased to\r\nrespect and to obey, even when they demanded things which were almost\r\nimpossible. General Eblé then with his 400 men departed in the evening\r\nof November 24th. for Borisow, followed by the clever General\r\nChasseloup who had some sappers with him, but without their tools.\r\nGeneral Chasseloup was a worthy associate of the illustrious chief of\r\nthe pontooneers. They marched all night, arriving at Borisow on the\r\n25th., at 5 o’clock in the morning. There they left some soldiers in\r\norder to deceive the Russians by making them believe that the bridge\r\nwas to be constructed below Borisow. Eblé with his pontooneers,\r\nhowever, marched through swamps and woods along the river as far as\r\nStudianka, arriving there during the afternoon of the 25th. Napoleon in\r\nhis impatience wanted the bridges finished on that day, an absolute\r\nimpossibility; it could not be done until the 26th., by working all\r\nnight, and not to rest until this was accomplished was the firm\r\nresolution of these men who by that time had marched two days and two\r\nnights. General Eblé spoke to his pontooneers, telling them that the\r\nfate of the army was in their hands. He inspired them with noble\r\nsentiments and received the promise of the most absolute devotedness.\r\nThey had to work in the bitter cold weather—severe frost having\r\nsuddenly set in—all night and during the next day, in the water, in the\r\nmidst of floating ice, probably under fire of the enemy, without rest,\r\nalmost without time to swallow some boiled meat; they had not even\r\nbread or salt or brandy. This was the price at which the army could be\r\nsaved. Each and every one of the pontooneers pledged himself to their\r\ngeneral, and we shall see how they kept their word.\r\n\r\nNot having time to fell trees and to cut them into planks, they\r\ndemolished the houses of the unfortunate village Studianka and took all\r\nthe wood which could serve for the construction of bridges; they forged\r\nthe iron needed to fasten the planks and in this way they made the\r\ntrestles. At daybreak of the 26th. they plunged these trestles into the\r\nBeresina. Napoleon, together with some of his generals, Murat,\r\nBerthier, Eugene, Caulaincourt, Duroc, and others, had hastened to\r\nStudianka on this morning to witness the progress of Eblé’s work. Their\r\nfaces expressed the greatest anxiety, for at this moment the question\r\nwas whether or not the master of the world would be taken prisoner by\r\nthe Russians. He watched the men working, exerting all their might in\r\nstrength and intelligence. But it was by no means sufficient to plunge\r\nbravely into the icy water and to fasten the trestles, the almost\r\nsuperhuman work had to be accomplished in spite of the enemy whose\r\noutposts were visible on the other side of the river. Were there merely\r\nsome Cossacks, or was there a whole army corps? This was an important\r\nquestion to solve. One of the officers, Jacqueminot, who was as brave\r\nas he was intelligent, rode into the water, traversed the Beresina, the\r\nhorse swimming part of the way, and reached the other shore. On account\r\nof the ice the landing was very difficult. In a little wood he found\r\nsome Cossacks, but altogether only very few enemies could be seen.\r\nJacqueminot then turned back to bring the good news to the emperor. As\r\nit was of the greatest importance to secure a prisoner to obtain exact\r\ninformation about what was to be feared or to be hoped, the brave\r\nJacqueminot once more crossed the Beresina, this time accompanied by\r\nsome determined cavalry men. They overpowered a Russian outpost, the\r\nmen sitting around a fire, took a corporal with them, and brought this\r\nprisoner before Napoleon who learned to his great satisfaction that\r\nTchitchakoff with his main force was before Borisow to prevent the\r\npassage of the French, and that at Studianka there was only a small\r\ndetachment of light troops.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to take advantage of these fortunate circumstances.\r\nBut the bridges were not ready. The brave General Corbineau with his\r\ncavalry brigade crossed the river under the above-described\r\ndifficulties, and established himself in the woods. Napoleon mounted a\r\nbattery of 40 cannons on the left shore, and now the French could\r\nflatter themselves to be masters of the right shore while the bridges\r\nwere made, and that their whole army would be able to cross. Napoleon’s\r\nstar seemed to brighten again, the officers grouped around him,\r\nsaluting with expressions of joy, such as they had not shown for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAll was now depending on the completion of the bridges, for there were\r\ntwo to be constructed, each 600 feet in length; one on the left for\r\nwagons, the other, on the right, for infantry and cavalry. A hundred\r\npontooneers had gone into the water and with the aid of little floats\r\nbuilt for this purpose, had commenced the fixation of the trestles. The\r\nwater was freezing and formed ice crusts around their shoulders, arms,\r\nand legs, ice crusts which adhered to the flesh and caused great pain.\r\nThey suffered without complaining, without appearing to be affected, so\r\ngreat was their ardor. The river at that point was 300 feet wide and\r\nwith 23 trestles for each bridge the two shores could be united. In\r\norder to transport first the troops, all efforts were concentrated on\r\nthe construction of the bridge to the right—that is, the one for\r\ninfantry and cavalry—and at 1 o’clock in the afternoon it was ready.\r\n\r\nAbout 9 thousand men of the corps of Marshal Oudinot passed over the\r\nfirst bridge and under great precautions took two cannons along.\r\nArrived on the other side, Oudinot faced some troops of infantry which\r\nGeneral Tschaplitz, the commander of the advance guard of Tchitchakoff,\r\nhad brought there. The engagement was very lively but of short\r\nduration. The French killed 200 men of the enemy and were able to\r\nestablish themselves in a good position, from where they could cover\r\nthe passage. Time was given now for the passage of enough troops to\r\nmeet Tchitchakoff, during the rest of the day, the 26th. and the\r\nsucceeding night. Concerning many details I have to refer to Thiers’\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nAt 4 o’clock in the afternoon the second bridge was completed.\r\nNapoleon, on the Studianka side, yet supervised everything; he wanted\r\nto remain among the last to cross the bridge. General Eblé, without\r\nhimself taking a moment of rest, had one-half the number of his\r\npontooneers rest on straw while the other half took up the painful task\r\nof guarding the bridges, of doing police duty, and of making repairs in\r\ncase of accidents, until they were relieved by the others. On this day\r\nthe infantry guards and what remained of cavalry guards marched over\r\nthe bridge, followed by the artillery train.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the left bridge, intended for vehicles, shook too much\r\nunder the enormous weight of wagons following one another without\r\ninterruption. Pressed as they were, the pontooneers had not had time to\r\nshape the timber forming the path, they had to use wood as they found\r\nit, and in order to deaden the rumbling of the wagons they had put\r\nmoss, hemp, straw—in fact, everything they could gather in\r\nStudianka—into the crevices. But the horses removed this kind of litter\r\nwith their feet, rendering the surface of the path very rough, so that\r\nit had formed undulations, and at 8 o’clock in the evening three\r\ntrestles gave way and fell, together with the wagons which they\r\ncarried, into the Beresina. The heroic pontooneers went to work again,\r\ngoing into the water which was so cold that ice immediately formed anew\r\nwhere it had been broken. With their axes they had to cut holes into\r\nthe ice to place new trestles six, seven and even eight feet deep into\r\nthe river were the bridge had given way. At 11 o’clock the bridge was\r\nsecure again.\r\n\r\nGeneral Eblé, who had always one relief at work while the other was\r\nasleep, took no rest himself. He had extra trestles made in case of\r\nanother accident. At 2 o’clock in the morning three trestles of the\r\nleft bridge, that is the one for the vehicles, gave way, unfortunately\r\nin the middle of the current, where the water had a depth of seven or\r\neight feet. This time the pontooneers had to accomplish their difficult\r\ntask in the darkness. The men, shaking from cold and starving, could\r\nnot work any more. The venerable General Eblé, who was not young as\r\nthey were and had not taken rest as they had, suffered more than they\r\ndid, but he had the moral superiority and spoke to them, appealing to\r\ntheir devotedness, told them of the certain disaster which would\r\nannihilate the whole army if they did not repair the bridges; and his\r\naddress made a deep impression. With supreme self-denial they went to\r\nwork again. General Lauriston, who had been sent by the emperor to\r\nlearn the cause of the new accident, pressed Eblé’s hand and, shedding\r\ntears, said to him: For God’s sake, hasten! Without showing impatience,\r\nEblé, who generally had the roughness of a strong and proud soul,\r\nanswered with kindness: You see what we are doing, and he turned to his\r\nmen to encourage, to direct them, and notwithstanding his age—he was 54\r\nyears old—he plunged into that icy water, which those young men were\r\nhardly able to endure (and this fact is stated by all the historians\r\nwhose works I have read). At 6 o’clock in the morning (November 27th.)\r\nthis second accident had been repaired, the artillery train could pass\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe bridge to the right—for infantry—did not have to endure the same\r\nkind of shaking up as the other bridge, and did not for one moment get\r\nout of order. If the stragglers and fugitives had obeyed all could have\r\ncrossed during the night from November 26th. to November 27th. But the\r\nattraction of some barns, some straw to lie on, some eatables found at\r\nStudianka, had retained a good many on this side of the river. The\r\nswamps surrounding the Beresina were frozen, which was a great\r\nadvantage, enabling the people to walk over them. On these frozen\r\nswamps had been lighted thousands of fires, and 10 thousand or 15\r\nthousand individuals had established themselves around them and did not\r\nwant to leave. Soon they should bitterly regret the loss of a precious\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, on November 27th., Napoleon crossed the Beresina,\r\ntogether with all who were attached to his headquarters, and selected\r\nfor his new headquarters the little village Zawnicky, on the other side\r\nof the Beresina. In front of him was the corps of Oudinot. All day long\r\nhe was on horseback personally to hasten the passage of detachments of\r\nthe army, somewhat over 5 thousand men under arms. Toward the end of\r\nthe day the first corps arrived, under Davout, who since Krasnoe had\r\nagain commanded the rear guard. This was the only corps which still had\r\nsome military appearance.\r\n\r\nThe day of November 27th. was occupied to cross the Beresina and to\r\nprepare for a desperate resistance, for the Russians could no longer be\r\ndeceived as to the location of the bridges. At 2 o’clock in the\r\nafternoon a third accident happened, again on the bridge to the left.\r\nIt was soon repaired, but the vehicles arrived in great numbers, and\r\nall were pressing forward in such a way that the gendarmes had\r\nextraordinary difficulties to enforce some order.\r\n\r\nThe 9th. corps, that of Marshal Victor, had taken a position between\r\nBorisow and Studianka, in order to protect the army at the latter\r\nplace. It had been foreseen that the crossing would be little\r\ninterfered with during the first two days, the 26th. and 27th., because\r\nTchitchakoff was as yet ignorant of the real points elected for the\r\nbridges, expecting to find the French army below Borisow on the other\r\nside of the Beresina. Wittgenstein and Kutusoff had not yet had time to\r\nunite and did not sufficiently press the French.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had good reasons to expect that the 28th. would be the\r\ndecisive day. He was resolved to save the army or to perish with it.\r\nTaking the greatest pains to deceive Tchitchakoff as long as possible\r\nhe ordered Marchal Victor to leave the division Partouneaux, which had\r\nbeen reduced by marches and fights from 12 thousand to 4 thousand\r\ncombatants, at Borisow. Victor with 9 thousand men and 700 to 800\r\nhorses was to cover Studianka.\r\n\r\nThese 9 thousand were the survivors of 24 thousand with whom Victor had\r\nleft Smolensk to join Oudinot on the Oula. During one month’s marching\r\nand in various engagements 10 thousand to 11 thousand had been lost.\r\nThe bearing, however, of those who survived was excellent, and seeing\r\nwhat was left of the grand army, the glory of which had, not long ago,\r\nbeen the object of their jealousy, in its present condition, they were\r\nstricken with pity and asked their oppressed comrades who had almost\r\nlost their pride as a result of the misery, what calamity could have\r\nbefallen them? You will soon be the same as we are, sadly answered the\r\nvictors of Smolensk and Borodino.\r\n\r\nThe hour of the supreme crisis had come. The enemy, having now learned\r\nthe truth, came to attack the French when many of them had not yet\r\ncrossed the Beresina and were divided between the two sides of the\r\nriver. Wittgenstein, who with 3 thousand men had followed the corps of\r\nVictor, was behind the latter between Borisow and Studianka, and ready\r\nwith all his might to throw Victor into the Beresina. Altogether,\r\nincluding the forces of Tchitchakoff, there were about 72 thousand\r\nRussians, without counting 30 thousand men of Kutusoff in the rear,\r\nready to fall on Victor’s 12 thousand to 13 thousand and Oudinot’s 7\r\nthousand or 8 thousand of the guards; 28 thousand to 30 thousand French\r\nwere divided between the two shores of the Beresina hampered by 40\r\nthousand stragglers, to fight, during the difficult operation of\r\ncrossing the Beresina, with 72 thousand partly in front, partly in the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nThis terrible struggle began in the evening of the 27th. The\r\nunfortunate French division of Partouneaux, the best of the three of\r\nVictor’s corps, had received orders from Napoleon to remain before\r\nBorisow during the 27th., in order to deceive, as long as possible, and\r\nto detain Tchitchakoff. In this position Partouneaux was separated from\r\nhis corps which, as we have seen, was concentrated around Studianka, by\r\nthree miles of wood and swamps. As could be easily foreseen,\r\nPartouneaux was cut off by the arrival of the troops of Platow,\r\nMiloradovitch, and Yermaloff, who had followed the French on the road\r\nfrom Orscha to Borisow. In the evening of the 27th. Partouneaux\r\nrecognized his desperate position. With the immense dangers threatening\r\nhim were combined the hideous embarrassment of several thousand\r\nstragglers who, believing in the passage below Borisow, had massed at\r\nthat point, with their baggage, awaiting the construction of the\r\nbridge. The better to deceive the enemy they had been left in their\r\nerror, and now they were destined to be sacrificed, together with the\r\ndivision of Partouneaux, on account of the terrible necessity to\r\ndeceive Tchitchakoff.\r\n\r\nWhen the bullets came from all sides, the confusion soon reached the\r\nclimax; the three little brigades of Partouneaux forming for defense\r\nfound themselves entangled with several thousand stragglers and\r\nfugitives who clamorously threw themselves into their ranks; the women\r\nof the mass, with baggage, especially with their frightful, piercing\r\ncries, characterized this scene of desolation. General Partouneaux\r\ndecided to extricate himself, to open a way or to perish. He was with a\r\nthousand men against 40 thousand. Several challenges to surrender he\r\nrefused, and kept on fighting. The enemy, likewise exhausted, suspended\r\nfiring toward midnight, being certain to take the last of this handful\r\nof braves who resisted so heroically in the morning. With daybreak the\r\nRussian generals again challenged General Partouneaux, who was standing\r\nupright in the snow with the 400 or 500 of his brigade, remonstrating\r\nwith him, and he, with desperation in his soul, surrendered. The other\r\ntwo brigades of his division that had been separated from him also laid\r\ndown their arms. The Russians took about 2 thousand prisoners, that is,\r\nthe survivors of Partouneaux’s division of 4 thousand, only one\r\nbattalion of 300 men had succeeded, during the darkness of the night,\r\nin making its escape and reaching Studianka.\r\n\r\nThe army at Studianka had heard, during this cruel night, the sound of\r\nthe cannonade and fusillade from the direction of Borisow. Napoleon and\r\nVictor were in great anxiety; the latter thought that the measure\r\ntaken, i.e., the sacrifice of his best division, of 4 thousand men who\r\nwould have been of great value, had been unjustifiable, because after\r\nthe crossing had begun on the 26th. it was no longer possible to\r\ndeceive the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe night was passed in cruel suspense, but being the prey of sorrows\r\nof so many kinds the French could hardly pay due attention to the many\r\nnew ones which presented themselves at every moment. The silence which\r\nreigned on the morning of the 28th. indicated the catastrophe of the\r\ndivision Partouneaux.\r\n\r\nThe firing now began on the two sides of the Beresina, on the right\r\nshore against the troops that had crossed, on the left against those\r\ncovering the passage of the rear of the army. From this moment on\r\nnothing was thought of but fight. The cannonade and fusillade soon\r\nbecame extremely violent, and Napoleon, on horseback, incessantly\r\nriding from one point to another, assumed that Oudinot resisted\r\nTchitchakoff while Eblé continued to care for the bridges, and that\r\nVictor, who was fighting Wittgenstein, was not thrown into the icy\r\nfloods of the Beresina together with the masses which had not yet\r\ncrossed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the firing was terrible on all sides and thousands were killed\r\non this lugubrious field; the French resisted on both banks of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nFor the description of this battle I desire to refer to Thiers’ great\r\nwork. Taking all circumstances into consideration, it did the greatest\r\nhonor to Napoleon’s guns, to the valor of his generals and of his\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe confusion was frightful among the masses that had neglected to\r\ncross in time, and those who had arrived too late for the opportunity.\r\nMany, ignoring that the first bridge was reserved for pedestrians and\r\nhorsemen, the second for wagons, crowded with delirious impatience upon\r\nthe second bridge. The pontooneers on guard at the entrance of the\r\nbridge to the right were ordering the vehicles to the one on the left,\r\nwhich was 600 feet farther down. This precaution was an absolute\r\nnecessity, because the bridge to the right could not endure the weight\r\nof the wagons. Those who were directed by the pontooneers to go to the\r\nother bridge had the greatest difficulty to pass through the compact\r\nmasses pressing and pushing to enter the structure. A terrible\r\nstruggle! Opposing currents of people paralyzed all progress. The\r\nbullets of the enemy, striking into this dense crowd, produced fearful\r\nfurrows and cries of terror from the fugitives; women with children,\r\nmany on wagons, added to the horror. All pressed, all pushed; the\r\nstronger ones trampled on those who had lost their foothold, and killed\r\nmany of the latter. Men on horseback were crushed, together with their\r\nhorses, many of the animals becoming unmanageable, shot forward,\r\nkicked, reared, turned into the crowd and gained a little space by\r\nthrowing people down into the river; but soon the space filled up\r\nagain, and the mass of people was as dense as before.\r\n\r\nThis pressing forward and backward, the cries, the bullets striking\r\ninto the helpless crowd, presented an atrocious scene—the climax of\r\nthat forever odious and senseless expedition of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nThe excellent General Eblé, whose heart broke at this spectacle, tried\r\nin vain to establish a little order. Placing himself at the head of the\r\nbridge he addressed the multitude; but it was only by means of the\r\nbayonet that at last some improvement was brought about, and some\r\nwomen, children, and wounded were saved. Some historians have stated\r\nthat the French themselves fired cannon shots into the crowd, but this\r\nis not mentioned by Thiers. This panic was the cause that more than\r\nhalf the number of those perished who otherwise could have crossed.\r\nMany threw themselves, or were pushed, into the water and drowned. And\r\nthis terrible conflict among the masses having lasted all day, far from\r\ndiminishing, it became more horrible with the progress of the battle\r\nbetween Victor and Wittgenstein. The description of this battle I omit,\r\nreferring again to Thiers, confining myself to give some figures. Of\r\n700 to 800 men of General Fournier’s cavalry hardly 300 survived; of\r\nMarshal Victor’s infantry, hardy 5 thousand. Of all these brave men,\r\nmostly Dutchmen, Germans, and Polanders, who had been sacrificed there\r\nwas quite a number of wounded who might have been saved, but who had\r\nperished for want of all means of transportation. The Russians lost 10\r\nthousand to 11 thousand.\r\n\r\nThis double battle on the two shores of the Beresina is one of the most\r\nglorious in the history of France; 28 thousand against 72 thousand\r\nRussians. These 28 thousand could have been taken or annihilated to the\r\nlast man, and it was almost a miracle that even a part of the army\r\nescaped this disaster.\r\n\r\nWith nightfall some calm came over this place of carnage and confusion.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning Napoleon had to recommence, this time not to\r\nretreat, but to flee; he had to wrest from the enemy the 5 thousand men\r\nof Marshal Victor’s corps, Victor’s artillery and as many as possible\r\nof those unfortunates who had not employed the two days by crossing.\r\nNapoleon ordered Marshal Victor to cross during the night with his\r\ncorps and with all his artillery, and to take with him as many as\r\npossible of the disbanded and of the refugees who were still on that\r\nother side of the river.\r\n\r\nHere we now learn of a singular flux and reflux of the frightened\r\nmasses. While the cannon had roared, every one wanted to cross but\r\ncould not, now when with nightfall the firing had ceased they did not\r\nthink any more of the danger of hesitation, not of the cruel lesson\r\nwhich they had learned during the day. They only wanted to keep away\r\nfrom the scene of horror which the crossing of the bridge had\r\npresented. It was a great task to force these unfortunates to cross the\r\nbridges before they were set on fire, a measure which was an absolute\r\nnecessity and which was to be executed on the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe first work for Eblé’s pontooneers was now to clear the avenues of\r\nthe bridges from the mass of the dead, men and horses, of demolished\r\nwagons, and of all sorts of impediments. This task could be\r\naccomplished only in part; the mass of cadavers was too great for the\r\ntime given for the removal of all of them, and those who crossed had to\r\nwalk over flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nIn the night, from 9 o’clock to midnight, Marshal Victor crossed the\r\nBeresina, thereby exposing himself to the enemy, who, however, was too\r\ntired to think of fighting. He brought his artillery over the left\r\nbridge, his infantry over the right one, and with the exception of the\r\nwounded and two pieces of artillery, all his men and all his material\r\nsafely reached the other side. The crossing accomplished, he erected a\r\nbattery to hold the Russians in check and to prevent them from crossing\r\nthe bridges.\r\n\r\nThere remained several thousand stragglers and fugitives on this side\r\nof the Beresina who could have crossed during the night but had refused\r\nto do so. Napoleon had given orders to destroy the bridges at daybreak\r\nand had sent word to General Eblé and Marshal Victor to employ all\r\nmeans in order to hasten the passage of those unfortunates. General\r\nEblé, accompanied by some officers, himself went to their bivouacs and\r\nimplored them to flee, emphasizing that he was going to destroy the\r\nbridges. But it was in vain; lying comfortably on straw or branches\r\naround great fires, devouring horse meat, they were afraid of the\r\ncrowding on the bridge during the night, they hesitated to give up a\r\nsure bivouac for an uncertain one, they feared that the frost, which\r\nwas very severe, would kill them in their enfeebled condition.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s orders to General Eblé was to destroy the bridges at 7\r\no’clock in the morning of November 29th., but this noble man, as humane\r\nas he was brave, hesitated. He had been awake that night, the sixth of\r\nthese vigils in succession, incessantly trying to accelerate the\r\npassing of the bridge; with daybreak, however, there was no need any\r\nmore to stimulate the unfortunates, they all were only too anxious now.\r\nThey all ran when the enemy became visible on the heights.\r\n\r\nEblé had waited till 8 o’clock when the order for the destruction of\r\nthe bridges was repeated to him, and in sight of the approaching enemy\r\nit was his duty not to lose one moment. However, trusting to the\r\nartillery of Victor, he still tried to save some people. His soul\r\nsuffered cruelly during this time of hesitation to execute an order the\r\nnecessity of which he knew only too well. Finally, having waited until\r\nalmost 9 o’clock when the enemy approached on the double quick, he\r\ndecided with broken heart, turning his eyes away from the frightful\r\nscene, to set fire to the structures. Those unfortunates who were on\r\nthe bridges threw themselves into the water, every one made a supreme\r\neffort to escape the Cossacks or captivity, which latter they feared\r\nmore than death.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks came up galloping, thrusting their lances into the midst\r\nof the crowd; they killed some, gathered the others, and drove them\r\nforward, like a herd of sheep, toward the Russian army. It is not\r\nexactly known if there were 6 thousand, 7 thousand or 8 thousand\r\nindividuals, men, women, and children, who were taken by the Cossacks.\r\n\r\nThe army was profoundly affected by this spectacle and nobody more so\r\nthan General Eblé who, in devoting himself to the salvation of all,\r\ncould well say that he was the savior of all who had not perished or\r\nbeen taken prisoner in the days of the Beresina. Of the 50 thousand,\r\narmed or unarmed, who had crossed there was not a single one who did\r\nnot owe his life and liberty to him and his pontooneers. But the 400\r\npontooneers who had worked in the water, paid with their lives for this\r\nnoblest deed in the history of wars; they all died within a short time.\r\nGeneral Eblé survived his act of bravery only three weeks; he died in\r\nKoenigsberg on the 21st. day of December, 1812.\r\n\r\nThis is an incomplete sketch of the immortal event of the Beresina,\r\nfull of psychological interest and therefore fit to be inserted in the\r\nmedical history of Napoleon’s campaign in Russia.\r\n\r\nTo a miraculous accident, the arrival of Corbineau, the noble\r\ndevotedness of Eblé, the desperate resistance of Victor and his\r\nsoldiers, to the energy of Oudinot, Ney, Legrand, Maison, Zayonchek,\r\nDoumerc, and, finally, to his own sure and profound decision, his\r\nrecognition of the true steps to be taken, Napoleon owed the\r\npossibility that he could escape after a bloody scene, the most\r\nhumiliating, the most crushing disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO EPISODES\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgeon Huber of the Wuerttembergians, writes to his friend, Surgeon\r\nHenri de Roos, who settled in Russia after the campaign of 1812, how he\r\ncrossed the Beresina, and in this connection he describes the following\r\ndreadful episode:\r\n\r\n“A young woman of twenty-five, the wife of a French colonel killed a\r\nfew days before in one of the engagements, was near me, within a short\r\ndistance of the bridge we were to cross. Oblivious of all that went on\r\nabout her, she seemed wholly engrossed in her daughter, a beautiful\r\nchild of four, that she held in the saddle before her. She made several\r\nunsuccessful attempts to cross the bridge and was driven back every\r\ntime, at which she seemed overwhelmed with blank despair. She did not\r\nweep; she would gaze heavenward, then fix her eyes upon her daughter,\r\nand once I heard her say: ‘O God, how wretched I am, I cannot even\r\npray!’ Almost at the same moment a bullet struck her horse and another\r\none penetrated her left thigh above the knee. With the deliberation of\r\nmute despair she took up the child that was crying, kissed it again and\r\nagain; then, using the blood-stained garter removed from her fractured\r\nlimb, she strangled the poor little thing and sat down with it, wrapped\r\nin her arms and hugged close to her bosom, beside her fallen horse.\r\nThus she awaited her end, without uttering a single word, and before\r\nlong she was trampled down by the riders making for the bridge.”\r\n\r\nThe great surgeon Larrey tells how he nearly perished at the crossing\r\nof the Beresina, how he went over the bridge twice to save his\r\nequipment and surgical instruments, and how he was vainly attempting to\r\nbreak through the crowd on the third trip, when, at the mention of his\r\nname, every one proffered assistance, and he was carried along by\r\nsoldier after soldier to the end of the bridge.\r\n\r\nHe has related the incident in a letter to his wife, dated from\r\nLeipzig, March 11th., 1813. “Ribes,” says he—Ribes was one of\r\nNapoleon’s physicians—“was right when he said that in the midst of the\r\narmy, and especially of the Imperial guard, I could not lose my life.\r\nIndeed, I owe my life to the soldiers. Some of them flew to my rescue\r\nwhen the Cossacks surrounded me and would have killed or taken me\r\nprisoner. Others hastened to lift me and help me on when I sank in the\r\nsnow from physical exhaustion. Others, again, seeing me suffer from\r\nhunger, gave me such provisions as they had; while as soon as I joined\r\ntheir bivouac they would all make room and cover me with straw or with\r\ntheir own clothes.”\r\n\r\nAt Larrey’s name, all the soldiers would rise and cheer with a friendly\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n“Any one else in my place,” writes Larrey further, “would have perished\r\non the bridge of the Beresina, crossing it as I was doing, for the\r\nthird time and at the most dangerous moment. But no sooner did they\r\nrecognize me than they grasped me with a vigorous hold, and sent me\r\nalong from hand to hand, like a bundle of clothes, to the end of the\r\nbridge.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILNA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe threatening barrier had been surmounted, and on went the march to\r\nWilna, without any possibility of a day’s rest, because the miserable\r\nremainder of the French army was still followed by light Russian\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nDuring the first days after the crossing of the Beresina the supply of\r\nfood had improved, it was better indeed than at any time during the\r\nretreat. They passed through villages which had not suffered from the\r\nwar, in which the barns were well filled with grain and with feed for\r\nthe horses, and there lived rich Jews who could sell whatever the\r\nsoldiers needed. Unfortunately, however, this improved condition lasted\r\nonly a few days, from November 30th. to December 4th., and before Wilna\r\nwas reached the want was felt again and made itself felt the more on\r\naccount of the most intense cold which had set in.\r\n\r\nDuring the few good days the soldiers had eaten roast pork, and all\r\nkinds of vegetables, in consequence their weakened digestive tract had\r\nbeen overtaxed so that diarrhoea became prevalent, a most frightful\r\ncondition during a march on the road, with a temperature of 25 deg.\r\nbelow zero, Reaumur (about 25 deg. below zero, Fahrenheit).\r\n\r\nThe 6th. of December was a frightful day, although the cold had not yet\r\nreached its climax which happened on the 7th. and 8th. of December,\r\nnamely 28 deg. below zero, Reaumur (31 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “The Gate of Wilna.”]\r\n\r\nHolzhausen gives a graphic description of the supernatural silence\r\nwhich reigned and which reminded of the silence in the arctic regions.\r\nThere was not the slightest breeze, the snowflakes fell vertically,\r\ncrystal-clear, the snow blinded the eyes, the sun appeared like a red\r\nhot ball with a halo, the sign of greatest cold.\r\n\r\nThe details of the descriptions which Holzhausen has collected from old\r\npapers surpass by far all we have learned from von Scherer’s and\r\nBeaupré’s writings. And all that Holzhausen relates is verified by\r\nnames of absolute reliability; it verifies the accounts of the two\r\nauthors named.\r\n\r\nGeneral von Roeder, one of the noblest of the German officers in\r\nNapoleon’s army—a facsimile of one of his letters is given in\r\nHolzhausen’s book—says about the murderous 7th. of December: “Pilgrims\r\nof the Grand Army, who had withstood many a severe frost indeed,\r\ndropped like flies, and of those who were well nourished, well\r\nclothed—many of these being of the reserve corps having but recently\r\ncome from Wilna to join the retreating army,—countless numbers fell\r\nexactly like the old exhausted warriors who had dragged themselves from\r\nMoscow to this place.”\r\n\r\nThe reserve troops of which Roeder speaks were the division Loison, the\r\nlast great body of men that had followed the army. They had been in\r\nKoenigsberg and had marched from there to Wilna during the month of\r\nNovember, had remained in the latter place until December 4th., when\r\nthey were sent to protect the retreating soldiers and the Emperor\r\nhimself, on leaving the wreck of his once grand army at Smorgoni on\r\nDecember 5th.\r\n\r\nThese troops who thus far had not sustained any hardships, came\r\ndirectly from the warm quarters of Wilna into the terrible cold.\r\n\r\nIt was quite frightful, says Roeder, to see these men, who a moment\r\nbefore had been talking quite lively, drop dead as if struck by\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nD. Geissler, a Weimaranian surgeon, renders a similar report and adds\r\nthat in some cases these victims suffered untold agonies before they\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Jacobs states that some said good bye to their comrades and\r\nlaid down along the road to die, that others acted like maniacs, cursed\r\ntheir fate, fell down, rose again, and fell down once more, never to\r\nrise again. Cases like the latter have been described also by First\r\nLieutenant von Schauroth.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, says Holzhausen, it appears almost\r\nincomprehensible that there were men who withstood a misery which\r\nsurpassed all human dimensions. And still there were such; who by\r\nmanfully bearing these sufferings, set to others a good example; there\r\nwere whole troops who, to protect others in pertinacious rear guard\r\nfights, opposed the on-pressing enemy.\r\n\r\nWonderful examples of courage and self-denial gave some women, the wife\r\nof a Sergeant-Major Martens, who had followed the army, and a Mrs.\r\nBasler, who was always active, preparing some food while her husband\r\nwith others was lying exhausted at the camp fire, and who seldom spoke,\r\nnever complained. This poor woman lost a son, a drummer boy, who had\r\nbeen wounded at Smolensk. She as well as her husband perished in Wilna.\r\n\r\nSergeant Toenges dragged a blind comrade along—I shall not leave him,\r\nhe said. Grenadiers, sitting around a fire, had pity on him and tried\r\nto relieve his sufferings. Many such examples are enumerated in\r\nHolzhausen’s book.\r\n\r\nOur highest admiration is due to the conduct of the brave troops of the\r\nrear guard who fought the Russians, who sacrificed themselves for the\r\nsake of the whole, and, like at Krasnoe and at the Beresina, for their\r\ndisbanded comrades.\r\n\r\nThe rearguard was at first commanded by Ney, then, after the 3rd. of\r\nDecember, by Marshal Victor; after the dissolution of Victor’s corps at\r\nSmorgoni and Krapowna, by Loison and, finally, near Wilna, by Wrede\r\nwith his Bavarians.\r\n\r\nCount Hochberg has given a classical description of the life in the\r\nrear guard; it is the most elevating description of greatness, of human\r\nmagnanimity, and it fills us with admiration for the noble, the brave\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nInteresting is the engagement at Malodeszno. A certain spell hangs over\r\nthis fight; here perished two Saxon regiments that had gloriously\r\nfought at the Beresina.\r\n\r\nThe scene was a romantic park with the castle of Count Oginsky where\r\nNapoleon had had his headquarters on the preceding day, and from where\r\nhe dated his for ever memorable 29th. bulletin in which he told the\r\nworld the ruin of his army.\r\n\r\nToward 2 o’clock in the afternoon the enemy attacked the division of\r\nGirard who was supported by Count Hochberg. Then the Russians attacked\r\nthe park itself. The situation was very serious, because the Badensian\r\ntroops under Hochberg had only a few cartridges and could not properly\r\nanswer the fire of the enemy. Night came, and the darkness, writes a\r\nBadensian sergeant, was of great advantage to us, for the Russians\r\nstood against a very small number, the proportion being one battalion\r\nto 100 men. Count Hochberg led his brigade, attacking with the bayonet,\r\nand nearly became a victim of his courage. The Badensian troops drove\r\nthe enemy away, but they themselves received the death blow. Count\r\nHochberg said he had no soldiers left whom he could command.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was the division Loison which formed the rear guard.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th. of December this division had come to Smorgoni where\r\nNapoleon took leave from his marshals and from his army, after he had\r\nentrusted Murat with the command.\r\n\r\nThe division Loison, during the eventful night from December 5th. to\r\n6th., had rendered great services. Without the presence of Loison’s\r\nsoldiers Napoleon would have fallen into the hands of his enemies, and\r\nthe wheel of the history of the world would have taken a different\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nDr. Geissler describes Napoleon, whom he saw at a few paces’ distance\r\non the day of his departure, and he writes “the personality of this\r\nextraordinary man, his physiognomy with the stamp of supreme\r\noriginality, the remembrance of his powerful deeds by which he moved\r\nthe world during his time, carried us away in involuntary admiration.\r\nWas not the voice which we heard the same which resounded all over\r\nEurope, which declared wars, decided battles, regulated the fate of\r\nempires, elevated or extinguished the glory of so many.”\r\n\r\nIt may appear strange that in a medical history I record these details,\r\nbut I give them because they show how the personality of Napoleon had\r\nretained its magic influence even in that critical moment.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers wanted to salute him with their _Vive l’Empereur_! but, in\r\nconsideration of the assumed incognito of the Imperator without an\r\narmy, it was interdicted.\r\n\r\nUp to this day Napoleon has been blamed for his step, to leave the\r\narmy. At the Beresina he had refused with pride the offer of some Poles\r\nto take him over the river and to bring him safely to Wilna. Now there\r\nwas nothing more to save of the army, and other duties called him\r\nperemptorily away. If we study well the situation, the complications\r\nwhich had arisen from the catastrophe and which were to arise in the\r\nfollowing year, we must in justice to him admit that he was obliged to\r\ngo in order to create another army.\r\n\r\nIt is not a complete history which I am writing; otherwise it would be\r\nmy duty to speak of the deep impression, the dramatic effect, which\r\nNapoleon’s departure had made on his soldiers. In presenting somewhat\r\nextensively some details of those days I simply wished to show who they\r\nwere and how many brave men there were who had been spared for the\r\natrocities of Wilna.\r\n\r\nIf I were to do justice to the voluminous material before me of the\r\nbravery of the soldiers on their march from the Beresina to Wilna I\r\nwould have to write a whole book on this part of the history alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce more the hope of the unfortunates should be disappointed in a most\r\ncruel way. They knew of fresh troops and of rich magazines in Wilna.\r\nBut only 2 thousand men were left of the Loison division, not enough to\r\ndefend the place against the enemy whose coming was to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe provisions, however, were stored in the magazines, and there were,\r\naccording to French accounts, forty day rations of bread, flour and\r\ncrackers for 100 thousand men, cattle for 36 days, 9 million rations of\r\nwine and brandy; in addition, vegetables and food for horses, as well\r\nas clothing in abundance.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the governor of Wilna, the Duke of Bassano, was only a\r\ndiplomat, entirely incompetent to handle the situation, which required\r\nmilitary talent.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate had also been Napoleon’s choice of Murat. On August 31st,\r\n1817, he said in conversation with Gourgaud, “I have made a great\r\nmistake in entrusting Murat with the highest command of the army,\r\nbecause he was the most incompetent man to act successfully under such\r\ncircumstances.”\r\n\r\nNo preparations were made for the entering troops, no quarters had been\r\nassigned for them when they came.\r\n\r\nAnd they came on the 9th; most horrible details have been recorded of\r\nthis day when the disbanded mass crowded the gate.\r\n\r\nWilna was not only not in ruins, but it was the only large city which\r\nhad not been abandoned by its inhabitants. But these inhabitants shut\r\ntheir doors before the entering soldiers. Only some officers and some\r\nGermans, the latter among the families of German mechanics, found an\r\nabode in the houses. Some Poles were hospitable, also some Lithuanians,\r\nand even the Jews.\r\n\r\nAll writers complain of the avidity and cruelty of the latter; they\r\nmixed among the soldiers to obtain whatever they had saved from the\r\npillage of Moscow. These Jews had everything the soldier was in need\r\nof, bread and brandy, delicacies and even horses and sleighs; in their\r\nrestaurants all who had money or valuables could be accommodated. And\r\nthese places were crowded with soldiers who feasted at the well\r\nsupplied tables, and even hilarity developed among these men saved from\r\nthe ice fields of Russia. During the night every space was occupied as\r\na resting place.\r\n\r\nWhile those who could afford it enjoyed all the good things of which\r\nthey had been deprived so long, the poor soldiers in the streets were\r\nin great misery. The doors being shut, they entered the houses by force\r\nand illtreated the inhabitants who on the next day took a bitter\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nEven the rich magazines had remained closed, tedious formalities had to\r\nbe observed, the carrying out of which was an impossibility since the\r\nwhole army was disbanded. No regiment had kept together, no detachment\r\ncould be selected to present vouchers for receiving rations.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Jacobs gives an illustration of the condition: “Orders had\r\nbeen given to receive rations for four days. Colonel von Egloffstein in\r\nthe evening of the 9th sent Lieutenant Jacobs with 100 men to the bread\r\nmagazine to secure as much as possible, and as this magazine was at\r\nsome distance, and as Cossacks had already entered the city, he ordered\r\n25 armed men to accompany the hundred, who, naturally enough, were not\r\narmed. The commissary of the magazine refused to hand out bread without\r\na written order of the commissaire-ordonateur; the lieutenant therefore\r\nnotified him that he would take by force what he needed for his\r\nregiment. And with his 25 carabiniers he had to fight for the bread.”\r\n\r\nFinally the pressing need led to violence. During the night of the\r\n10th. the desperate soldiers, aided by inhabitants, broke into the\r\nmagazines, at first into those containing clothing, then they opened\r\nthe provision stores, throwing flour bags and loaves of bread into the\r\nstreet where the masses fought for these missiles. And when the liquor\r\ndepots were broken into, the crowd forced its way in with howls. They\r\nbroke the barrels, and wild orgies took place until the building took\r\nfire and many of the revelers became the victims of the flames.\r\n\r\nWhile this pillaging went on the market place of Wilna was the scene of\r\nevents not less frightful. A detachment of Loison’s division, obedient\r\nto their duty, had congregated there, stacked arms and, in order to\r\nwarm themselves to the best of their ability—the temperature was 30\r\ndeg. below zero R. (37 deg. below zero F.)—and to thaw the frozen\r\nbread, had lighted a fire. I cannot describe the fight among these\r\nsoldiers for single pieces of bread; they were too horrid.\r\n\r\nThis night ended, and in the morning the cannon was heard again.\r\n\r\nAn early attack had been expected, and perspicacious officers had taken\r\nadvantage of the few hours of rest to urge their men to prepare for the\r\nlast march to the near frontier. Count Hochberg implored his officers\r\nto follow this advice, but the fatigues and sickness they had\r\nundergone, their frozen limbs and the threat of greater misery, made\r\nmost of them refuse to heed his entreaties. Thus Hochberg lost 74 of\r\nhis best and most useful officers who remained in Wilna and died there.\r\nSimilar attempts were made in other quarters. Many of those addressed\r\nlaughed sneeringly. This sneering I shall never forget, says Lieutenant\r\nvon Hailbronner, who escaped while the enemy was entering. Death on the\r\nroad to Kowno was easier, after all, than dying slowly in the hospitals\r\nof Wilna.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th., in the morning, the Russians entered, and the Cossacks\r\nran their lances through every one in their way.\r\n\r\nThere were fights in the streets, the troops of the division Loison\r\nfought the Russians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOld Sergeant Picart, of the old guard, on hearing the drum, struck his\r\ncomrade Bourgogne, the writer of some memoirs of the campaign, on the\r\nshoulder, saying: “Forward, comrade, we are of the old guard, we must\r\nbe the first under arms.” And Bourgogne went along, although sick and\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nGerman and French bravery vied with each other on the 10th. of\r\nDecember. Ney and Loison along with Wrede. The latter, on the day\r\nprevious, had come to the house of the marshal to offer him a small\r\nescort of cavalry if he would leave Wilna. Ney pointing to the mass of\r\nsoldiers who had to be protected, answered: “All the Cossacks in the\r\nworld shall not bring me out of this city to-night.”\r\n\r\nNey and Wrede left with their troops.\r\n\r\nWoe to those who had remained, their number was about 10 thousand,\r\nbesides 5 thousand sick in the hospitals.\r\n\r\nAccording to Roeder, 500 were murdered in the streets on this day,\r\npartly by Cossacks, partly by Jews, the latter revenging themselves for\r\nill treatment.\r\n\r\nAll reports, and they are numerous, of Germans, French and also\r\nRussians, speak of the cruelty of the Jews of Wilna. We must not\r\nforget, however, the provocations under which they had to suffer, nor\r\nhow they, in supplying soldiers with eatables and clothing, saved many\r\nwho otherwise would have perished.\r\n\r\nVon Lossberg says that Christian people of Wilna have also taken part\r\nin the massacre, and only the Poles did not participate.\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks began their bloody work early in the morning.\r\n\r\nAwful cries of the tortured were heard in the Wuerttembergian hospital,\r\ntelling the sick who were lying there what they themselves had to\r\nexpect from the entering enemies.\r\n\r\nThose who had remained in Smolensk and Moscow after the armed soldiers\r\nhad departed were at once massacred. In Wilna likewise many were\r\nmurdered, but the greater number—many thousands—(other circumstances\r\ndid not permit to do away with all these prisoners in the same way)\r\nperished after days or weeks of sickness and privations of all kind.\r\n\r\nWilna’s convents could tell of it if their walls could speak.\r\n\r\nDr. Geissler narrates that the prisoners in the Basilius monastery into\r\nwhich soldiers of all nationalities had been driven, during 13 days\r\nreceived only a little hardtack, but neither wood nor a drop of water;\r\nthey had to quench their thirst with the snow which covered the corpses\r\nin the yard.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman Wilson, of whom I have spoken already, who had come to\r\nWilna with Kutusow’s army, says: “The Basilius monastery, transformed\r\ninto a prison, offered a terrible sight—7,500 corpses were piled up in\r\nthe corridors, and corpses were also in other parts of the building,\r\nthe broken windows and the holes in the walls were plugged with feet,\r\nlegs, hands, heads, trunks, just as they would fit in the openings to\r\nkeep out the cold air. The putrefying flesh spread a terrible stench.”\r\n\r\n(Carpon, a French Surgeon-Major who was with the army in Wilna, has\r\ndescribed the events in a paper “_Les Morts de Wilna_”. I cannot quote\r\nfrom his writings because he gives impossible statistics and\r\ncontradicts himself in his narrations.)\r\n\r\nYelin speaks of a hospital in which all the inmates had been murdered\r\nby the Cossacks. He himself was in a Wuerttembergian hospital and\r\ndescribes his experience: “Terrible was the moment when the door was\r\nburst open. The monsters came in and distributed themselves all over\r\nthe house. We gave them all we had and implored them on our knees to\r\nhave pity, but all in vain. ‘Schelma Franzuski,’ they answered, at the\r\nsame time they beat us with their kantchous, kicked us unmercifully\r\nwith their feet, and as new Cossacks came in all the time, we were\r\nfinally deprived of all our clothing and beaten like dogs. Even the\r\nbandages of the poor wounded were torn off in search of hidden money or\r\nvaluables. Lieutenant Kuhn (a piece of his cranium had been torn away\r\nat Borodino) was searched; he fell down like dead and it took a long\r\ntime and much pain to bring him to life again.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant von Soden was beaten with hellish cruelty on his sore feet\r\nand gangraenous toes so that they bled. When nothing more could be\r\nfound on the sick and wounded they were left lying on the stone floor.\r\n\r\nThere was no idea of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe cold in the rooms was so great that hands and feet of many were\r\nfrozen.\r\n\r\nSometimes prisoners shaking with frost would sneak out at night to find\r\na little wood. Some Westphalians who had tried this were beaten to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nSome of the prisoners were literally eaten up by lice.\r\n\r\nThose who did not die of their wounds, of filth, and of misery, were\r\ncarried away by petechial typhus which had developed into a violent\r\nepidemic in Wilna, and several thousand of the citizens, among them\r\nmany Jews, succumbed to the ravages of this disease.\r\n\r\nOne witness writes: “Little ceremony was observed in disposing of the\r\ndead; every morning I heard how those who had died during the night\r\nwere thrown down the stairs or over the balcony into the yard, and by\r\ncounting these sinister sounds of falling bodies we knew how many had\r\ndied during the night.”\r\n\r\nThe brutality of the guards was beyond description. First Lieutenant\r\nvon Grolman, one of the most highly educated officers of the Badensian\r\ncontingent, was thrown down the stairway because this (seriously\r\nwounded) officer had disturbed the inspector during the latter’s\r\nleisure hour.\r\n\r\nBeating with the kantchou was nothing unusual.\r\n\r\nA Weimaranian musician, Theuss, has described some guileful tortures\r\npracticed on the prisoners, which are so revolting that I dare not\r\nwrite them. They are given in Holzhausen’s book.\r\n\r\nIn their despair the prisoners, especially the officers among them,\r\nsent petitions to Duke Alexander of Wuerttemberg, to the Tzar, to the\r\nGrand Duke Constantine, and to the Ladies of the Russian Court. The\r\nTzar and his brother Constantine came and visited the hospitals. They\r\nwere struck by what they saw, and ordered relief. Officers were\r\npermitted to walk about the city, and many obtained quarters in private\r\nhouses. Those who could not yet leave the gloomy wards of the hospitals\r\nwere better cared for.\r\n\r\nIt is touching to read Yelin’s narration how the emaciated arms of\r\nthose in the hospitals were stretched out when their comrades,\r\nreturning from a promenade in the city, brought them a few apples.\r\n\r\nAs they were no longer guarded as closely as before, many succeeded in\r\nescaping. Captain Roeder was one of them; Yelin was offered aid to\r\nflee, but he remained because he had given his word of honor to remain.\r\n\r\nBut most of these favors came too late, only one tenth were left that\r\ncould be saved, the others had succumbed to their sufferings or died\r\nfrom typhus.\r\n\r\nA pestilential odor filled Wilna. Heaps of cadavers were burnt and when\r\nthis was found to be too expensive, thrown into the Wilia. Few of the\r\nhigher officers were laid at rest in the cemetery, among them General\r\nvon Roeder who as long as he was able had tried everything in his power\r\nto ameliorate the condition of his soldiers. Holzhausen brings the\r\nfacsimile of a letter of his, dated Wilna, December 30th., to the King\r\nof Wuerttemberg which proves his care for his soldiers. He died on\r\nJanuary 6th., 1813.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM WILNA TO KOWNO\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the prisoners of Wilna were suffering these nameless cruelties,\r\nthe unfortunate army marched to reach the border of Russia at Kowno,\r\nthe same Kowno where the Grand Army six months before had been seen in\r\nall its military splendor, crossing the Niemen.\r\n\r\nThey had now to march 75 miles, a three days’ march to arrive there.\r\n\r\nThe conditions were about the same as those on the march from the\r\nBeresina to Wilna. Still the same misery, frost, and hunger, scenes of\r\nmurder, fire. The description of the details would in general be a\r\nrepetition, with little variation.\r\n\r\nThe following is an account of the last days of the retreat taken from\r\na letter of Berthier to the Emperor.\r\n\r\nWhen the army entered Wilna on December 8th., almost all the men were\r\nchilled by cold, and despite the commands of Murat and Berthier,\r\ndespite the fact that the Russians were at the gates, both officers and\r\nsoldiers kept to their quarters and refused to march.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the 10th, the march upon Kowno was begun. But the extreme\r\ncold and the excess of snow completed the rout of the army. The final\r\ndisbanding occurred on the 10th, and 11th., only a struggling column\r\nremained, extending along the road, strewn with corpses, setting out at\r\ndaybreak to halt at night in utter confusion. In fact, there was no\r\narmy left. How could it have subsisted with 25 degrees of cold? The\r\nonslaught, alas, was not of the foe, but of the harshest and severest\r\nof seasons fraught with crippling effect and untold suffering.\r\n\r\nBerthier, as well as Murat, would have wished to remain in Kowno\r\nthrough the 12th., but the disorder was extreme. Houses were pillaged\r\nand sacked, half the town was burned down, the Niemen was being crossed\r\nat all points, and it was impossible to stem the tide of fugitives. An\r\nescort was barely available for the protection of the King of Naples,\r\nthe generals, and the Imperial eagles. And all amidst the cold, the\r\nintense cold, stupefying and benumbing!\r\n\r\nFour fifths of the army—or what bore the name of such, though reduced\r\nto a mere conglomeration and bereft of fighting men—had frozen limbs;\r\nand when Koenigsberg was reached, in a state of complete\r\ndisorganisation, the surgeons were constantly employed in amputating\r\nfingers and toes.\r\n\r\nDr. W. Zelle, a German military surgeon, in his book “1812” describes\r\nthe last days of the army. Kowno was occupied by a considerable force\r\nof artillery, with two German battalions, and it contained also very\r\nlarge supplies, a great deal of ammunition, provisions, clothing, and\r\narms of various kinds. About an hour’s march from Wilna the retreating\r\nmasses encountered the hill and defile of Ponary and it was at this\r\npoint where the imperial treasure, so far conscientiously guarded by\r\nGerman troops from Baden and Wuerttemberg, was lost. When the leaders\r\nof the treasure became convinced of the impossibility to save it, the\r\njaded horses not being able after 15 hours’ effort to climb the ice\r\ncovered hill, they had the wagons opened, the money chests broken, and\r\nthe coin surrendered to the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the gold brought new life even to the half frozen ones;\r\nthey threw away their arms and were so greedy in loading themselves\r\ndown with the mammon that many of them did not notice the approaching\r\nCossacks until it was too late. Friend and foe, Frenchmen and Russians\r\npillaged the wagons. Honor, money, and what little had remained of\r\ndiscipline, all was lost at this point.\r\n\r\nHowever, side by side with these outrages, noble deeds could also be\r\nrecorded. Numerous wagons with wounded officers had to be abandoned,\r\nthe horses being too weak to take another step, and many of the\r\nsoldiers disregarded everything to save these unfortunates, carrying\r\nthem away on their shoulders. An adjutant of the emperor, Count\r\nTurenne, distributed the private treasure of the emperor among the\r\nsoldiers of the Old Guard, and not one of these faithful men kept any\r\nof the money for himself. All was honestly returned later on, and more\r\nthan 6 millions of francs reached Danzig safely.\r\n\r\nThe retreat during these scenes and the following days, when the\r\nterrible cold caused more victims from hour to hour, was still covered\r\nby Ney whose iron constitution defied all hardships. From five until\r\nten at night he personally checked the advance of the enemy, during the\r\nnight he marched, driving all stragglers before him. From seven in the\r\nmorning until ten the rear guard rested, after which time they\r\ncontinued the daily fight.\r\n\r\nHis Bavarians numbered 260 on December 11th., 150 on the 17th. and on\r\nthe 13th. the last 20 were taken prisoners. The corps had disappeared.\r\nThe remainder of Loison’s division and the garrison of Wilna diminished\r\nin the same manner until, finally, the rear guard consisted of only 60\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat was left of the army reached Kowno on the 12th, after a long,\r\ntedious march, dying of cold and hunger. In Kowno there was an\r\nabundance of clothes, flour, and spirits. But the unrestrained soldiers\r\nbroke the barrels, so that the spilled liquor formed a lake in the\r\nmarket place. The soldiers threw themselves down and by the hundreds\r\ndrank until they were intoxicated. More than 1200 drunken men reeled\r\nthrough the streets, dropped drowsily upon the icy stones or into the\r\nsnow, their sleep soon passing into death. Of the entire corps of\r\nEugene there remained only eight or ten officers with the prince. Only\r\none day more (the 13th.) was the powerful Ney able, with the two German\r\nbattalions of the garrison, to check the Cossacks, vigorously supported\r\nby the indefatigable generals, Gerard and Wrede. Not until the 14th.,\r\nat 9 o’clock at night, did he begin to retreat, with the last of the\r\nmen, after having destroyed the bridges over the Wilia and the Niemen.\r\nAlways fighting, receding but not fleeing, his person formed the rear\r\nguard of this Grand Army which five months previous crossed the river\r\nat this very point, now, on the 14th, consisting of only 500 foot\r\nguards, 600 horse guards, and nine cannon.\r\n\r\nIt is nobody but Ney who still represents the Grand Army, who fires the\r\nlast shot before he, the last Frenchman, crosses the bridge over the\r\nNiemen, which is blown up behind him. If we look upon the knightly\r\nconduct of Ney during the entire campaign we cannot but think how much\r\ngreater he was than the heroes of Homer.\r\n\r\nThis man has demonstrated to the world upon this most terrible of all\r\nretreats that even fate is not able to subdue an imperturbable courage,\r\nthat even the greatest adversity redounds to the glory of a hero.\r\n\r\nMore than a thousand times did Ney earn in Russia the epithet, “the\r\nbravest of the brave,” and the legend which French tradition has woven\r\naround his person is quite justified. No mortal has ever performed such\r\ndeeds of indomitable moral courage; all other heroes and exploits\r\nvanish in comparison!\r\n\r\nHere, at the Niemen, the pursuit by the Russians came to an end for the\r\ntime being. They, too, had suffered enormously.\r\n\r\nNot less than 18 thousand Russians were sick in Wilna; Kutusoff’s army\r\nwas reduced to 35 thousand men, that of Wittgenstein from 50 thousand\r\nto 15 thousand. The entire Russian army, including the garrison of\r\nRiga, numbered not more than 100 thousand. The winter, this terrible\r\nally of the Russians, exacted a high price for the assistance it had\r\nrendered them; of 10 thousand men who left the interior, well provided\r\nwith all necessities, only 1700 reached Wilna; the troops of cavalry\r\ndid not number more than 20 men.\r\n\r\nIn all the literature which I have examined I did not find a better\r\ndescription of the life and the struggle of the soldiers on the retreat\r\nthan that given by General Heinrich von Brandt of his march from Zembin\r\nto Wilna. It is a vivid picture of many details from which we derive a\r\nfull understanding of the great misery on the retreat in general.\r\n\r\nI shall give an extensive extract in his own words:\r\n\r\n“We arrived late at Zembin, where we found many bivouac fires. It was\r\nvery cold. Here and there around the fires were lying dead soldiers.\r\n\r\n“After a short rest, which had given us some new strength, we continued\r\nthe march. If the stragglers arrive, we said to ourselves, we shall be\r\nlost; therefore, let us hurry and keep ahead of them. Our little column\r\nkept well together, but at every halt some men were missing. Toward\r\ndaybreak the cold became more severe. While it was dark yet, we met a\r\nfile of gunpowder carts carrying wounded; from a number of these\r\nvehicles we heard heart-rending clamors of some of the wounded asking\r\nus to give them death.\r\n\r\n“At every moment we encountered dead or dying comrades, officers and\r\nsoldiers, who were sitting on the road, exhausted from fatigue,\r\nawaiting their end. The sun rose blood-red; the cold was frightful. We\r\nstopped near a village where bivouac fires were burning. Around these\r\nfires were grouped living and dead soldiers. We lodged ourselves as\r\nwell as we could and took from those who had retired from the scene of\r\nlife—apparently during their sleep—anything that could be of service to\r\nus. I for my part helped myself to a pot in which I melted snow to make\r\na soup from some bread crusts which I had in my pocket. We all relished\r\nthis soup.\r\n\r\n“After an hour’s rest we resumed our march and about 30 hours after our\r\ndeparture we reached Plechtchenissi. During this time we had made 25\r\nmiles. At Plechtchenissi we found, at a kind of farm, sick, wounded and\r\ndead, all lying pell-mell. There was no room for us in the house; we\r\nwere obliged to camp outside, but great fires compensated us for the\r\nwant of shelter.\r\n\r\n“We decided to rest during part of the night. While some of the\r\nsoldiers roasted slices of horse meat and others prepared oatmeal cakes\r\nfrom oats which they had found in the village, we tried to sleep. But\r\nthe frightful scenes through which we had passed kept us excited, and\r\nsleep would not come.\r\n\r\n“Toward 1 o’clock in the morning we left for Molodetchno. The cold was\r\nfrightful. Our way was marked by the light of the bivouac fires which\r\nwere seen at intervals and by cadavers of men and horses lying\r\neverywhere, and as the moon and the stars were out we could see them\r\nwell. Our column became smaller all the while, officers and men\r\ndisappeared without our noticing their departure, without our knowing\r\nwhere they had fallen behind; and the cold increased constantly. When\r\nwe stopped at some bivouac fire it seemed to us as if we were among the\r\ndead; nobody stirred, only occasionally would one or the other of those\r\nsitting around raise his head, look upon us with glassy eyes, rest\r\nagain, probably never to rise again. What made the march during that\r\nnight especially disagreeable was the icy wind whipping our faces.\r\nToward 8 o’clock in the morning we perceived a church tower. That is\r\nMolodetchno, we all cried with one voice. But to our disappointment we\r\nlearned on our arrival that it was only Iliya, and that we were only\r\nhalf-way to Molodetchno.\r\n\r\n“Iliya was not completely deserted by the inhabitants, but the troops\r\nthat had passed through it before us had left almost nothing eatable in\r\nthe place. We found abode in some houses and for a while were protected\r\nfrom the cold which was by no means abating. In the farm of which we\r\ntook possession we found a warm room and a good litter, which we owed\r\nto our predecessors.\r\n\r\n“It was strange that none of us could sleep; we all were in a state of\r\nfeverish excitement, and I attribute this to an indistinct fear; once\r\nasleep we might perhaps not awake again, as we had seen it happen a\r\nthousand times.\r\n\r\n“The longer we remained at Iliya the more comfortable we felt, and we\r\ndecided to stay there all day and wait for news. Soup of buckwheat, a\r\nlarge pot of boiled corn, some slices of roast horse meat, although all\r\nwithout salt, formed a meal which we thought delicious.”\r\n\r\nVon Brandt describes how they took off their garments, or their\r\nwrappings which served as garments, to clean and repair them; how some\r\nof his men found leather with which they enveloped their feet. The day\r\nand the night passed, and all had some sleep. But they had to leave.\r\n\r\n“Some of the men refused to go; one of them when urged to come along\r\nsaid: ‘Captain, let me die here; we all are to perish, a few days\r\nsooner or later is of no consequence.’ He was wounded, but not\r\nseriously, a bullet had passed through his arm; it was a kind of apathy\r\nwhich had come over him, and he could not be persuaded. He remained and\r\nprobably died.\r\n\r\n“We left; the cold was almost unbearable. Along the road we found\r\nbivouacs, at which one detachment relieved the other; the succeeding\r\nsurpassing the preceding one in misery and distress. Everywhere, on the\r\nroad and in the bivouacs, the dead were lying, most of them stripped of\r\ntheir clothes.\r\n\r\n“It was imperative to keep moving, for remaining too long at the\r\nbivouac fires meant death, and dangerous was it also to remain behind,\r\nseparated from the troop. (The danger of being alone under such\r\ncircumstances as existed here has been pointed out by Beaupré.)\r\n\r\n“We marched to Molodetchno where the great road commences and where we\r\nexpected some amelioration, and, indeed, we found it. The everlasting\r\ncold was now the principal cause of our sufferings.\r\n\r\n“In the village there was some kind of order; we saw many soldiers\r\nbearing arms and of a general good appearance. The houses were not all\r\ndeserted, neither were they as overcrowded as in other places through\r\nwhich we had passed. We established ourselves in some of them situated\r\non the road to Smorgoni, and we had reason to be satisfied with our\r\nchoice. We bought bread at an enormous price, made soup of it which\r\ntasted very good to us, and we had plenty for all of us.\r\n\r\n“At Molodetchno men of our division joined us and brought us the news\r\nof the crossing of the Beresina.”\r\n\r\nvon Brandt gives the description of the events at the Beresina and\r\ntells of the historical significance of Molodetchno as the place where\r\nNapoleon sojourned 18 hours and from where he dated the 29th. bulletin.\r\n\r\n“We left the village on the following morning at an early hour and\r\ncontinued our march on the road to Smorgoni.\r\n\r\n“A description of this march,” writes von Brandt, “would only be a\r\nrepetition of what had been said of scenes of preceding days. We were\r\novertaken by a snowstorm the violence of which surpassed all\r\nimagination, fortunately this violence lasted only some hours, but on\r\naccount of it our little column became dispersed.\r\n\r\n“One bivouac left an impression of horror to last for all my lifetime.\r\nIn a village crowded with soldiers we came to a fire which was burning\r\nquite lively, around it were lying some dead. We were tired; it was\r\nlate, and we decided to rest there. We removed the corpses to make room\r\nfor the living and arranged ourselves the best way we could. A fence\r\nagainst which the snow had drifted protected us from the north wind.\r\nMany who passed by envied us this good place. Some stopped for a while,\r\nothers tried to establish themselves near us. Gradually the fatigue\r\nbrought sleep to some of us; the stronger ones brought wood to keep up\r\nthe fire. But it snowed constantly; after one had warmed one side of\r\nthe body an effort was made to warm the other; after one foot had been\r\nwarmed the other was brought near the flame; a complete rest was\r\nimpossible. At daybreak we prepared to depart. Thirteen men of our\r\ntroop, all wounded, did not answer the roll call. My heart pained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “No fear, we soon shall follow you.”]\r\n\r\n“We had to pass in front of the fence which had given us protection\r\nagainst the wind during the night. Imagine our surprise when we saw\r\nthat what we had taken for a fence was a pile of corpses which our\r\npredecessors had heaped one upon the other. These dead were men of all\r\ncountries, Frenchmen, Swiss, Italians, Poles, Germans, as we could\r\ndistinguish by their uniforms. Most of them had their arms extended as\r\nif they had been stretching themselves. ‘Look, Captain,’ said one of\r\nthe soldiers, ‘they stretch their hands out to us; ah, no fear, we soon\r\nshall follow you.’\r\n\r\n“We were soon to have another horrid sight. In a village, many houses\r\nof which had been burnt, there were the ghastly remains of burnt\r\ncorpses, and in one building, especially, there was a large number of\r\nsuch infesting the air with their stench. A repetition of scenes I had\r\nseen at Saragossa and at Smolensk.”\r\n\r\n“At sunset we arrived at Smorgoni, and here we enjoyed great comfort.\r\nIt was the first place where we could obtain something for money. From\r\nan old Jewess we bought bread, rice, and also a little coffee, all at\r\nreasonable prices. It was the first cup of coffee I had had for months,\r\nand it invigorated me very much.”\r\n\r\n“We were young, and our good humor had soon been restored to us; it\r\nmade us forget, for the time being at least, how much we had suffered,\r\nand at this moment we did not think of the suffering yet in store for\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“We left for Ochmiana; our march was tedious. Again we encountered a\r\ngreat many dead strewn on the road; many of them had died from cold;\r\nsome still had their arms, young men, well dressed, their cloaks,\r\nshoes, and socks, however, were taken from them. Half way to Ochmiana\r\nwe took a rest at a bivouac which had been evacuated quite recently.”\r\n\r\n“The night we passed here was fearful. I had an inflamed foot, and felt\r\na burning pain under the arms which caused me great difficulty in the\r\nuse of my crutches. Fortunately I found a place on which a fire had\r\nbeen burning, and I was not obliged to sleep on the snow. The soldiers\r\nkept up a fire all night, and I had a good and invigorating sleep, in\r\nconsequence of which I could take up the march on the following day,\r\nwith new courage and zeal.”\r\n\r\n“Toward 11 o’clock we arrived, together with a mass of fugitives, at\r\nOchmiana. Before entering the city we encountered a convoy of\r\nprovisions, escorted by a young Mecklenburg officer, Lieutenant\r\nRudloff, who some years later served as a Prussian general. He made an\r\nattempt to defend his sleighs, but in vain. The crowd surrounded him\r\nand his convoy and pushed in such a manner that neither he nor his men\r\nwere able to stir. The sleighs, carrying excellent biscuits, were\r\npillaged. I myself gathered some in the snow, and I can well say that\r\nthey saved my life until we reached Wilna.”\r\n\r\n“Arrived at Ochmiana we at once continued our march upon Miednicki.”\r\n\r\n“The city was occupied by a crowd of disbanded soldiers—marauders who\r\nhad established themselves everywhere. It was only with difficulty that\r\nwe found some sort of lodging in a kind of pavilion which was icy and\r\nhad no chimneys. However, we managed to heat it and arranged litter for\r\n20 men. With bread and biscuit brought from Ochmiana we prepared a good\r\nmeal.”\r\n\r\n“When we crossed the Goina we numbered 50; this number had increased so\r\nthat we were at one time 70, but now our number had decreased to 29.”\r\n\r\n“We left at an early hour on the next morning. It was frightfully cold.\r\nHalf way to Miednicki we had to stop at a bivouac. On the road we saw\r\nmany cadavers.” Von Brandt here describes the fatal effects of cold and\r\nhis description, though less complete, corresponds with the\r\ndescriptions given by Beaupré, von Scherer, and others. Especially\r\nrevolting, he says, was the sight of the toes of the cadavers; often\r\nthere were no more soft parts. The soldiers, first of all, took the\r\nshoes from their dead comrades, next the cloaks; they would wear two or\r\nthree or cut one to cover their feet and their head with the pieces.\r\n\r\nThe last part of the march to Miedniki was most painful for von Brandt,\r\non account of the inflammation of his left foot.\r\n\r\nHe describes his stay at that place in which there were many\r\nstragglers. He bivouaked in a garden; they had straw enough and a good\r\nfire, also biscuits from Ochmiana, and they suffered only from the\r\ncold, 30 deg. below zero R. (36 deg. below zero Fahrenheit.) On this\r\noccasion von Brandt speaks of the pains, the sufferings, the condition\r\nof his comrades. One of them, Zelinski, had not uttered a word since\r\ntheir departure from Smorgoni; he had no tobacco, and this troubled him\r\nmore than physical pain; another one, Karpisz, crushed by sorrow and\r\nsufferings, was in a delirious state; in the same condition were some\r\nof the wounded. But after all, in the midst of their sad reflections,\r\nsome of them fell asleep. Those who were well enough took up reliefs on\r\nnight watch. Every one of the group had to bear some special great\r\nmisery, and upon the whole their trials were beyond endurance: In the\r\nopen air at 30 deg. R. below zero, without sufficient clothing, without\r\nprovisions, full of vermin, exposed at any moment to the attacks of the\r\nenemy, surrounded by a rapacious rabble, deprived of aid, wounded, they\r\nwere hardly in a condition to drag themselves along.\r\n\r\n“Still an 8 hours’ march to Wilna,” I said to Zelinski; “Will we reach\r\nthere?” He shook his head in doubt.\r\n\r\nOne of the men, Wasilenka, a sergeant, the most courageous, the firmest\r\nof the little column, of a robust constitution, had found at Ochmiana\r\nsome brandy and some potatoes. He said if one had not lost his head\r\nentirely, one could have many things, but nothing can be done with the\r\nFrench any more; they are not the Frenchmen of former times, a\r\nCossack’s casque upsets them; it is a shame! And he told the great news\r\nof Napoleon’s departure from the army of which the others of von\r\nBrandt’s column had yet not been informed. Interesting as was the\r\nconversation on this event, I have to omit it.\r\n\r\nThe extreme cold did not allow much sleep; long before daylight they\r\nwere on their feet. It was a morning of desolation, as always.\r\n\r\nvon Brandt now describes the characteristic phenomena of the landscape;\r\nthe words are almost identical with the description Beaupré has given\r\nof the Russian landscape in the winter of 1812.\r\n\r\n“I could not march, the pain under my shoulders was very great. I felt\r\nas if all at this region of my body would tear off. But I marched all\r\nthe same. Many were already on the road, all in haste to reach the\r\nsupposed end of their sufferings. They seemed to be in a race, and the\r\ncold, the incredible cold, drove them also to march quickly. On this\r\nday there perished more men than usual, and we passed these\r\nunfortunates without a sign of pity, as if all human feeling had been\r\nextinguished in the souls of us, the surviving. We marched in silence,\r\nhardly any one uttered a word; if, however, some one spoke, it was to\r\nsay how is it that I am not in your place; besides this nothing was\r\nheard but the sighing and the groans of the dying.\r\n\r\n“It was perhaps 9 o’clock when we had covered half of the way and took\r\na short rest, after which we resumed our march and arrived before Wilna\r\ntoward 3 o’clock, having marched ten hours, exhausted beyond\r\ndescription. The cold was intolerable; as I learned afterward it had\r\nreached 29 deg. below zero Reaumur (36 deg. below zero Fahrenheit.) But\r\nimagine our surprise when armed guards forbade us to enter the city.\r\nThe order had been given to admit only regular troops. The commanders\r\nhad thought of the excesses of Smolensk and Orscha and here at least\r\nthey intended to save the magazines from pillage. Our little column\r\nremained at the gate for a while; we saw that whoever risked to mix\r\nwith the crowd could not extricate himself again and could neither\r\nadvance nor return. It came near sunset, the cold by no means abated\r\nbut, on the contrary, augmented. Every minute the crowd increased in\r\nnumber, the dying and dead mixed up with the living. We decided to go\r\naround the city, to try to enter at some other part; after half an\r\nhour’s march we succeeded and found ourselves in the streets. They were\r\nfull of baggage, soldiers, and inhabitants. But where to turn? Where to\r\nseek aid? By good luck we remembered that our officers passing Wilna on\r\ntheir way during the spring had been well received by Mr. Malczewski, a\r\nfriend of our colonel. Nothing more natural than to go to him and ask\r\nfor asylum. But imagine our joy, our delight, when at our arrival at\r\nthe house we found our colonel himself, the quartermaster and many\r\nofficers known by us, who all were the guests of Mr. Malczewski. Even\r\nLieutenant Gordon who commanded our depot at Thorn was there; he had\r\ncome after he had had the news of the battle of Borodino.\r\n\r\n“My faithful servant Maciejowski and the brave Wasilenka carried me up\r\nthe stairs and placed me in bed. I was half dead, hardly master of my\r\nsenses. Gordon gave me a shirt, my servant took charge of my garments\r\nto free them from vermin, and after I had had some cups of hot beer\r\nwith ginger in it and was under a warm blanket, I recovered strength\r\nenough to understand what I was told and to do what I was asked to do.”\r\n\r\n“A Jewish physician examined and dressed my wounds. He found my\r\nshoulders very much inflamed and prescribed an ointment which had an\r\nexcellent effect. I fell into a profound sleep which was interrupted by\r\nthe most bizarre imaginary scenes; there was not one of the hideous\r\nepisodes of the last fortnight which did not pass in some form or\r\nanother before my mind.”\r\n\r\n“Washed, cleaned, passably invigorated, refreshed especially by some\r\ncups of hot beer, I was able to rise on the following morning and to\r\nassist at the council which the colonel had called together.”\r\n\r\nVon Brandt now describes how the mass of fugitives came and pillaged\r\nthe magazines. The colonel saved a great many, supplied them with\r\nshoes, cloaks, caps, woolen socks, and provisions, von Brandt describes\r\nthe scenes of Wilna from the time the Cossacks had entered.\r\n\r\n“The colonel prepared to depart; at first he hesitated to take us, the\r\nwounded, along, asking if we could stand the voyage. I said to remain\r\nwould be certain death, and with confidence I set out on the march with\r\nmy men, the number of whom was now twenty. We had sleighs and good\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n“The night was superb. It was light like day. The stars shone more\r\nradiantly than ever upon our misery. The cold was still severe beyond\r\ndescription and more sensible to us who had nearly lost the habit to\r\nfeel it during forty-eight hours of relief.\r\n\r\n“We had to make our way through an indescribable tangle of carriages\r\nand wagons to reach the gate, and the road as far as we could see was\r\nalso covered with vehicles, wagons, sleighs, cannons, all mixed up. We\r\nhad great difficulties to remain together.\r\n\r\n“After an hour’s march all came to a halt; we found ourselves before a\r\nveritable sea of men. The wagons could not be drawn over a hill on\r\naccount of the ice, and the road became hopelessly blockaded. Here it\r\nwas where the military treasure of 12 million francs was given to the\r\nsoldiers.”\r\n\r\nVon Brandt describes his most wonderful adventures on the way to Kowno\r\nwhich, although most interesting, add nothing to what has already been\r\ndescribed. I gave this foregoing part of von Brandt’s narration because\r\nit gives a most vivid picture of the life of the soldiers during the\r\nsupreme moments of the retreat from Moscow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRISONERS OF WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nBeaupré was taken prisoner at the passage of the Beresina and remained\r\nin captivity for some time. His lot as a prisoner of war was an\r\nexceptionally good one. He tells us that prisoners when they were out\r\nof such parts of the country as had been ravaged by the armies,\r\nreceived regular rations of a very good quality, and were lodged by\r\neight, ten, and twelve, with the peasants. In the provincial capitals,\r\nthey received furs of sheep skin, fur bonnets, gloves, and coarse\r\nwoolen stockings, a sort of dress that appeared to them grotesque as\r\nwell as novel, but which was very precious as a protection against the\r\ncold during the winter. When arrived at the places in which they were\r\nto pass the time of their captivity they found their lot ameliorated,\r\nand the reception accorded to them demanded a grateful eulogy of the\r\nhospitality exercised by the Russians.\r\n\r\nQuite different was the experience of a very young German, Karl Schehl,\r\na private whose memoirs have been kept in his family, and were recently\r\npublished by one of his grand-nephews. After a battle on the retreat\r\nfrom Moscow he, with many others, was taken prisoner by Cossacks, who\r\nat once plundered the captives. Schehl was deprived of his uniform, his\r\nbreeches, his boots. He had a gold ring on his ring finger, and one of\r\nthe Cossacks, thinking it too much trouble to remove the ring in the\r\nnatural way, had already drawn his sabre to cut off the prisoner’s left\r\nhand, when an officer saw this and gave the brutal Cossack a terrible\r\nblow in the face; he then removed the ring without hurting the boy and\r\nkept it for himself. Another officer took Schehl’s gold watch. Schehl\r\nstood then with no other garment but a shirt, and barefoot, in the\r\nbitter cold, not daring to approach the bivouac fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Cossacks (on examining the garments of Schehl), found in one of the\r\npockets a B clarinette. This discovery gave them great pleasure; they\r\ninduced their captive to play for them, and he played, chilled to the\r\nbone in his scanty costume. But now the Cossacks came to offer him\r\ngarments, a regular outfit for the Russian winter. They gave him food\r\nto eat and did all they could to show their appreciation of the music.\r\nWhat a rapid change of fortune within two hours, writes Schehl. Toward\r\nnoon, riding a good horse, with considerable money in Russian bank\r\nnotes and a valuable gold watch in his possession, all brought from\r\nMoscow, at 1 p.m. he stood dressed in a shirt only, with his bare feet\r\non the frozen ground, and at 2 p. m. he was admired as an artist by a\r\nlarge audience that gave him warm clothes, which meant protection\r\nagainst the danger of freezing to death, and a place near the fire.\r\n\r\nDuring that afternoon and the following night more French soldiers of\r\nall arms, mostly emaciated and miserable, were escorted to the camp by\r\nRussian militia, peasants, armed with long, sharp lances. It was the\r\nnight from October 30th. to 31st., at the time of the first snowfall,\r\nwith a temperature of -12 deg. Reaumur (about 5 degrees above zero\r\nFahrenheit). Of the 700 prisoners, many of them deprived of their\r\nclothing, as Schehl had been deprived, who had to camp without a fire,\r\nquite a number did not see the next morning, and the already described\r\nsnow hills indicated where these unfortunates had reached the end of\r\ntheir sufferings. The commanding officer of the Cossacks ordered the\r\nsurviving prisoners to fall in line for the march back to Moscow. The\r\nescort consisted of two Cossacks and several hundred peasant-soldiers.\r\nWithin sixteen hours the 700 had been reduced to 500. And they had to\r\nmarch back over the road which they had come yesterday as companions of\r\ntheir emperor. The march was slow, they were hardly an hour on the road\r\nwhen here and there one of the poor, half naked, starving men fell into\r\nthe snow; immediately was he pierced with the lance of one of the\r\npeasant soldiers who shouted stopai sukinsin (forward you dog), but as\r\na rule the one who had fallen was no longer able to obey the brutal\r\ncommand. Two Russian peasant soldiers would then take hold, one at each\r\nleg, and drag the dying man with the head over snow and stones until he\r\nwas dead, then leave the corpse in the middle of the road. In the woods\r\nthey would practice the same cruelties as the North American Indians,\r\ntie those who could not rise to a tree and amuse themselves by\r\ntorturing the victim to death with their lances. And, says Schehl, I\r\ncould narrate still other savageries, but they are too revolting, they\r\nare worse than those of the savage Indians. Fortunately, Schehl himself\r\nwas protected from all molestations by the peasants by the two Cossacks\r\nof the escort. He was even taken into the provision wagon where he\r\ncould ride between bundles of hay and straw. On the evening of the\r\nfirst day’s march the troops camped in a birch forest. Russian people\r\nare fond of melancholy music; Schehl played for them adagios on his\r\nclarinette, and the Cossacks gave him the best they had to eat. His\r\ncomrades, now reduced to 400 in number, received no food and were so\r\nterror-stricken or so feeble that only from time to time they emitted\r\nsounds of clamor. Some would crawl into the snow and perish, while\r\nthose who kept on moving were able to prolong their miserable lives.\r\nThe second night took away 100 more, so that the number of prisoners\r\nwas reduced to less than 300 on the morning of October 31st. During the\r\nnight from October 31st. to November 1st. more than one-half of the\r\nprisoners who had come into the camp had perished, and there were only\r\nabout 100 men left to begin the march. This mortality was frightful.\r\nSchehl thinks that the peasants killed many during the night in order\r\nto be relieved of their guard duty. For the Cossacks would send the\r\nsuperfluous guardsmen away and retain only as many as one for every\r\nfour prisoners. They saw that the completely exhausted Frenchmen could\r\nbe driven forward like a herd of sick sheep, and hardly needed any\r\nguard. In the morning we passed a village, writes Schehl, in which\r\nstood some houses which had not been burned. The returned inhabitants\r\nwere busy clearing away the rubbish and had built some provisional\r\nstraw huts. I sat as harmless as possible on my wagon when suddenly a\r\ngirl in one of the straw huts screamed loud Matuschka! Matuschka!\r\nFranzusi! Franzusi Niewolni! (Mother! mother! Frenchmen! French\r\nprisoners!), and now sprang forward a large woman, armed with a thick\r\nclub and struck me such a powerful blow on the head that I became\r\nunconscious. When I opened my eyes again the woman struck me once more,\r\nthis time on my left shoulder and so violently that I screamed. My arm\r\nwas paralyzed from the stroke. Fortunately, one of the Cossacks came to\r\nmy rescue, scolded the woman, and chased her away.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 1st., the troops came to a village through\r\nwhich no soldiers had passed, which had not been disturbed by the war.\r\nOf the prisoners only 60 remained alive, and these were lodged in the\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nSchehl describes the interior of the houses of Russian peasants as well\r\nas the customs of the Russian peasants, which description is highly\r\ninteresting, and I shall give a brief abstract of it.\r\n\r\nThe houses are all frame buildings with a thatched roof, erected upon a\r\nfoundation of large unhewn stones, the interstices of which are filled\r\nwith clay, and built in an oblong shape, of strong, round pine logs\r\nplaced one on top of the other. Each layer is stuffed with moss, and\r\nthe ends of the logs are interlocking. The buildings consist of one\r\nstory only, with a very small, unvaulted cellar.\r\n\r\nUsually there are only two rooms in these houses, and wealthy peasants\r\nuse both of them for their personal requirements; the poorer classes,\r\non the other hand, use only one of the rooms for themselves, and the\r\nother for their horses, cows, and pigs.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent part of the interior arrangement of these rooms is\r\nthe oven, covering about six feet square, with a brick chimney in the\r\nhouses of the wealthy, but without chimney in those of the poor, so\r\nthat the smoke must pass through the door giving a varnished appearance\r\nto the entire ceiling over the door.\r\n\r\nThere are no chairs in the rooms; during the day broad benches along\r\nthe walls and oven are used instead. At night, the members of the\r\nhousehold lie down to sleep on these benches, using any convenient\r\npiece of clothing for a pillow. It seems the Russian peasant of one\r\nhundred years ago considered beds a luxury.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these houses, those of the rich as well as those of the\r\npoor, contains in the easterly corner of the sitting room a cabinet\r\nwith more or less costly sacred images.\r\n\r\nOn entering the room the newcomer immediately turns his face toward the\r\ncabinet, crossing himself three times in the Greek fashion,\r\nsimultaneously inclining his head, and not until this act of devotion\r\nhas been performed does he address individually every one present. In\r\ngreeting, the family name is never mentioned, only the first name, to\r\nwhich is added: Son of so and so (likewise the first name only), but\r\nthe inclination of the head—pagoda like—is never omitted.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the household say their very simple prayers in front\r\nof the cabinet; at least, I never heard them say anything else but\r\n_Gospodin pomilui_ (O Lord, have mercy upon us); but such a prayer is\r\nvery fatiguing for old and feeble persons because _Gospodin pomilui_ is\r\nrepeated at least 24 times, and every repetition is accompanied with a\r\ngenuflection and a prostration, naturally entailing a great deal of\r\nhardship owing to the continued exertion of the entire body.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sacred cabinet, the oven, and the benches, every one\r\nof the rooms contains another loose bench about six feet long, a table\r\nof the same length, and the kvass barrel which is indispensable to\r\nevery Russian.\r\n\r\nThis cask is a wooden vat of about 50 to 60 gallons capacity, standing\r\nupright, the bottom of which is covered with a little rye flour and\r\nwheat bran—the poor use chaff of rye—upon which hot water is poured.\r\nThe water becomes acidulated in about 24 hours and tastes like water\r\nmixed with vinegar. A little clean rye straw is placed inside of the\r\nvat, in front of the bunghole, allowing the kvass to run fairly clear\r\ninto the wooden cup. When the vat is three-quarters empty more water is\r\nadded; this must be done very often, as the kvass barrel with its\r\nsingle drinking cup—placed always on top of the barrel—is regarded as\r\ncommon property. Every member of the household and every stranger draws\r\nand drinks from it to their heart’s content, without ever asking\r\npermission of the owner of the house. Kvass is a very refreshing summer\r\ndrink, especially in the houses of wealthy peasants who need not be\r\nparticular with their rye flour and who frequently renew the original\r\ningredients of the concoction.\r\n\r\nThe peasant soldiers took the most comfortable places; for Schehl and\r\nhis nine comrades, who were lodged with him in one of the houses, straw\r\nwas given to make a bed on the floor, but most of the nine syntrophoi\r\nwere so sick and feeble that they could not make their couch, and six\r\ncould not even eat the pound of bread which every one had received;\r\nthey hid the remaining bread under the rags which represented their\r\ngarments. Schehl, although he could not raise his left arm, helped the\r\nsick, notwithstanding the pain he suffered, to spread the straw on the\r\nfloor. On the morning of the 2d. of November the sick, who had not been\r\nable to eat all their bread, were dead. Schehl, while the surviving\r\nones were still asleep, took the bread which he found on the corpses,\r\nto hide it in his sheepskin coat. This inheritance was to be the means\r\nof saving his life; without it he would have starved to death while a\r\nprisoner in Moscow.\r\n\r\nThey left this village with now only 29 prisoners and arrived on the\r\nsame evening, reduced to 11 in number, in Moscow, where they were\r\nlocked up in one of the houses, together with many other prisoners. Of\r\nthe 700 fellow prisoners of Schehl 689 had died during the four days\r\nand four nights of hunger, cold, and most barbaric cruelties. If the\r\nprisoners had hoped to be saved from further cruelties while in Moscow\r\nthey were bitterly disappointed. First of all, their guards took from\r\nthem all they themselves could use, and on this occasion Schehl lost\r\nhis clarinette which he considered as his life saver. Fortunately, they\r\ndid not take from him the six pieces of bread. After having been\r\nsearched the prisoners were driven into a room which was already filled\r\nwith sick or dying, lying on the floor with very little and bad straw\r\nunder them. The newcomers had difficulties to find room for themselves\r\namong these other unfortunates. The guards brought a pail of fresh\r\nwater but nothing to eat. In a room with two windows, which faced the\r\ninner court-yard, were locked up over 30 prisoners, and all the other\r\nrooms in the building were filled in the same way. During the night\r\nfrom November 2d. to November 3d. several of Schehl’s companions died\r\nand were thrown through the window into the court yard, after the\r\njailors had taken from the corpses whatever they could use. Similar\r\nacts were performed in the other rooms, and it gave the survivors a\r\nlittle more room to stretch their limbs. This frightful condition\r\nlasted six days and six nights, during which time no food was given to\r\nthem. The corpses in the yard were piled up so high that the pile\r\nreached up to the windows. It was 48 hours since Schehl had eaten the\r\nlast of the six pieces of bread, and he was so tortured by hunger that\r\nhe lost all courage, when at 10 o’clock in the forenoon a Russian\r\nofficer entered and in German ordered the prisoners to get ready within\r\nan hour for roll call in the court yard, because the interimistic\r\ncommanding officer of Moscow, Colonel Orlowski, was to review them.\r\nImmediately before this took place, the prisoners had held a counsel\r\namong themselves whether it would be wise to offer themselves for\r\nRussian military service in order to escape the imminent danger of\r\nstarving to death. When that officer so unexpectedly had entered,\r\nSchehl, although the youngest—he was only 15 years of age—but\r\nrelatively the strongest, because he was the last of them who had had a\r\nlittle to eat, rose with difficulty from his straw bed and made the\r\noffer, saying that they were at present very weak and sick from hunger,\r\nbut that they would soon regain their strength if they were given\r\nsomething to eat. The officer in a sarcastic and rough manner replied:\r\n“His Majesty our glorious Emperor, Alexander, has soldiers enough and\r\ndoes not need you dogs.” He turned and left the room, leaving the\r\nunfortunates in a state of despair. Toward 11 o’clock he returned,\r\nordering the prisoners to descend the stairs and fall in line in the\r\ncourt yard. All crawled from their rooms, 80 in number, and stood at\r\nattention before the colonel, who was a very handsome and strong man,\r\nsix foot tall, with expressive and benevolent features. The youth of\r\nSchehl made an impression on him, and he asked in German: “My little\r\nfellow, are you already a soldier?”\r\n\r\nS. At your service, colonel.\r\n\r\nC. How old are you?\r\n\r\nS. Fifteen years, colonel.\r\n\r\nC. How is it possible that you at your young age came into service?\r\n\r\nS. Only my passion for horses induced me to volunteer my services in\r\nthe most beautiful regiment of France, as trumpeter.\r\n\r\nC. Can you ride horseback and take care of horses?\r\n\r\nS. At your service, colonel!\r\n\r\nC. Where are the many prisoners who have been brought here, according\r\nto reports there should be 800.\r\n\r\nS. What you see here, colonel, is the sad remainder of those 800 men.\r\nThe others have died.\r\n\r\nC. Is there an epidemic disease in this house?\r\n\r\nS. Pardon me, colonel, but those comrades of mine have all died from\r\nstarvation; for during the six days we are here we received no food.\r\n\r\nC. What you say, little fellow, cannot be true, for I have ordered to\r\ngive you the prescribed rations of bread, meat, and brandy, the same as\r\nare given to the Russian soldiers, and this has been the will of the\r\nCzar.\r\n\r\nS. Excuse me, colonel, I have told the truth, and if you will take the\r\npains to walk into the rear yard you will see the corpses.\r\n\r\nThe colonel went and convinced himself of the correctness of my\r\nstatement. He returned in the greatest anger, addressed some officer in\r\nRussian, gave some orders and went along the front to hear Schehl’s\r\nreport confirmed by several other prisoners. The officer who had\r\nreceived orders returned, accompanied by six Uhlans, each of the latter\r\nwith hazelnut sticks. Now the jailors were called and had to deliver\r\neverything which they had taken from their prisoners; unfortunately,\r\nSchehl’s clarinette was not among the articles that were returned. And\r\nnow Schehl witnessed the most severe punishment executed on the\r\njailors. They had to remove their coats and were whipped with such\r\ncannibal cruelty that bloody pieces of flesh were torn off their backs,\r\nand some had to be carried from the place. They deserved severe\r\npunishment, for they had sold all the food which during six days had\r\nbeen delivered to them for 800 men.\r\n\r\nThe surviving prisoners were now treated well, the colonel took Schehl\r\nwith him to do service in his castle.\r\n\r\nThe case of Karl Schehl is a typical one.\r\n\r\nHolzhausen has collected a great many similar ones from family papers,\r\nwhich never before had been published. All the writers of these papers\r\nspeak, exactly like Schehl, in plain, truthful language, and the best\r\nproof of their veracity is that all, independent of each other, tell\r\nthe same story of savage cruelty and of robbery. All, in narrating\r\ntheir experiences, do not omit any detail, all give dates and\r\nlocalities which they had retained exactly from those fearful days\r\nwhich had left the most vivid impressions. There is much repetition in\r\nthese narrations, for all had experienced the same.\r\n\r\nAll tell that the Cossacks were the first to rob the prisoners. These\r\nirregular soldiers received no pay and considered it their right to\r\ncompensate themselves for the hardships of the campaign by means of\r\nrobbery.\r\n\r\nBesides the tales collected by Holzhausen I can refer to many other\r\nwriters, Frenchmen, the Englishman Wilson, and even Russians among\r\nthem, but the material is so voluminous that I shall confine myself to\r\nselect only what concerned physicians who were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe Bavarian Sanitary Corps, captured at Polotsk, after having been\r\nmercilessly robbed by Cossacks, was brought before a Russian General,\r\nwho did not even take notice of them. It was only after Russian\r\nphysicians interfered in their behalf that they obtained a hearing of\r\ntheir grievances.\r\n\r\nPrisoners tell touching stories how they were saved by German\r\nphysicians, in most instances from typhus. In almost all larger Russian\r\ncities there were German physicians, and this was a blessing to many of\r\nthe prisoners. Holzhausen gives the names of several of the sick and\r\nthe names of the physicians who spared no pains in attending to the\r\nsufferers.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time and with the change of circumstances the lot of\r\nthe prisoners in general was ameliorated, and in many instances their\r\nlife became comfortable. Many found employment as farm hands or at some\r\ntrade, as teachers of languages, but the principal occupation at which\r\nthey succeeded was the practice of medicine. Whether they were\r\ncompetent physicians or only dilettantes they all gained the confidence\r\nof the Russian peasantry. In a land in which physicians are scarce the\r\nfollowers of Aesculap are highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nWhen a Russian peasant had overloaded his stomach and some harmless\r\nmixture or decoction given him by some of the pseudo physicians had had\r\na good effect—post hoc ergo propter hoc—the medicine man who had come\r\nfrom far away was highly praised and highly recommended.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Furtenbach treated with so-called sympathetic remedies and\r\nhad a success which surprised nobody more than himself.\r\n\r\nReal physicians were appreciated by the educated and influential\r\nRussians and secured a more lucrative practice within weeks than they\r\nhad been able to secure after years at home. Dr. Roos, of whom I have\r\nalready spoken, having been taken prisoner near the Beresina, became\r\nphysician to the hospitals of Borisow and Schitzkow and soon had the\r\ngreatest private practice of any physician in the vicinity; he\r\nafterward was called to the large hospitals in St. Petersburg, and was\r\nawarded highest honors by the Russian government.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable was the career of Adjutant Braun which has been told by\r\nhis friend, Lieutenant Peppler, who acted as his assistant.\r\n\r\nBraun had studied medicine for a while, but exchanged sound and lancet\r\nfor the musket. As prisoner of war, at the urgent request of his friend\r\nPeppler, he utilized his unfinished studies. Venaesection was very\r\npopular in Russia, he secured a lancet, a German tailor made rollers\r\nfor him, and soon he shed much Russian blood. The greatest triumph,\r\nhowever, of the two Aesculapians was Braun’s successful operation for\r\ncataract which he performed on a police officer, his instrument being a\r\nrusty needle. The description of the operating scene during which the\r\nassistant Peppler trembled from excitement is highly dramatic. Braun\r\nbecame the favorite of the populace and everybody regretted that he\r\nleft when he was free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF TYPHUS\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the old publications referring to the medical history of\r\nNapoleon’s campaign in Russia I found one of a Prussian army physician,\r\nDr. Krantz, published in the year 1817 with the following title:\r\nBemerkungen ueber den Gang der Krankheiten welche in der königlich\r\npreussischen Armee vom Ausbruch des Krieges im Jahre 1812 bis zu Ende\r\ndes Waffenstillstandes (im Aug.) 1813 geherrscht haben. (Remarks on the\r\ncourse of the Diseases which have reigned in the Royal Prussian Army\r\nfrom the Beginning of the War in the Year 1812 until the End of the\r\nArmistice [in August] 1813). From this I shall give the following\r\nextract:\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the soldiers constituting the wreck of the Grand\r\nArmy wherever they passed on their way from Russia through Germany\r\nspread ruin; their presence brought death to thousands of peaceful\r\ncitizens. Even those who were apparently well carried the germs of\r\ndisease with them, for we found whole families, says Krantz, in whose\r\ndwelling soldiers, showing no signs of disease, had stayed over night,\r\nstricken down with typhus. The Prussian soldiers of York’s corps had\r\nnot been with the Grand Army in Moscow, and there was no typhus among\r\nthem until they followed the French on their road of retreat from\r\nRussia. From this moment on, however, the disease spread with the\r\ngreatest rapidity in the whole Prussian army corps, and this spreading\r\ntook place with a certain uniformity among the different divisions. On\r\naccount of the overflowing of the rivers, the men had to march closely\r\ntogether on the road, at least until they passed the Vistula near\r\nDirschau, Moeve, and Marienwerder. Of the rapid extent of the infection\r\nwe can form an idea when we learn the following facts: In the first\r\nEast Prussian regiment of infantry, when it came to the Vistula, there\r\nwas not a single case of typhus, while after a march of 14 miles on the\r\nhighway which the French had passed before them there were 15 to 20 men\r\nsick in every company, every tenth or even every seventh man. In those\r\ndivisions which had been exposed to infection while in former\r\ncantonments, the cases were much more numerous, 20 to 30 in every\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with typhus there appeared the first cases of an\r\nepidemic ophthalmy. Although the eye affection was not as general as\r\nthe typhus—it occurred only in some of the divisions, and then at the\r\noutset not so severely as later on—both evils were evidently related to\r\neach other by a common causal nexus. They appeared simultaneously under\r\nsimilar circumstances, but never attacked simultaneously the same\r\nindividual. Whoever had ophthalmy was immune against typhus and vice\r\nversa, and this immunity furnished by one against the other evil lasted\r\na long period of time. Both diseases were very often cured on the\r\nmarch. We found confirmed, says Krantz, what had been asserted a long\r\ntime before by experienced physicians, that cold air had the most\r\nbeneficial effect during the inflammatory stage of contagious typhus.\r\nFor this reason the soldiers who presented the first well-known\r\nsymptoms of typhus infection: headache, nausea, vertigo, etc., were\r\nseparated from their healthy comrades and entrusted to medical care,\r\nand this consisted, except in the case of extraordinarily grave\r\nsymptoms, in dressing the patient with warm clothing and placing him\r\nfor the march on a wagon where he was covered all over with straw. The\r\nwagon was driven fast, to follow the corps, but halted frequently on\r\nthe way at houses where tea (Infusum Chamomillae, species aromaticarum,\r\netc.) with or without wine or spiritus sulphuricus aetherius were\r\nprepared; of this drink the patient was given a few cupfuls to warm\r\nhim. As a precaution against frost, which proved to be a very wise one,\r\nhands and feet were wrapped in rags soaked in spiritus vini\r\ncamphoratus. For quarters at night isolated houses were selected for\r\ntheir reception—a precaution taught by sad experience—and surgeons or\r\ncouriers who had come there in advance had made the best preparations\r\npossible. All the hospitals between the Vistula and Berlin, constantly\r\noverfilled, were thoroughly infected, and thus transformed into regular\r\npest-houses exhaling perdition to every one who entered, the physicians\r\nand attendants included. On the other hand, most of the patients who\r\nwere treated on the march recovered. Of 31 cases of typhus of the 2d.\r\nbattalion of the infantry guards transported from Tilsit to Tuchel,\r\nonly one died, while the remaining 30 regained their health completely,\r\na statistical result as favorable as has hardly ever happened in the\r\nbest regulated hospital and which is the more surprising on account of\r\nthe severe form of the disease at that time. An equally favorable\r\nresult was obtained in the first East Prussian regiment of infantry on\r\nthe march from the Vistula to the Spree.\r\n\r\nThere was not a single death on the march; of 330 patients 300\r\nrecovered, 30 were sent into hospitals of Elbing, Maerkisch Friedland,\r\nConitz, and Berlin, and the same excellent results were reported from\r\nother divisions of the corps where the same method had been followed.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable observation among the immense number of patients was\r\nthat they seldom presented a stage of convalescence. Three days after\r\nthey had been free from fever for 24 hours they were fit, without\r\nbaggage, for a half or even a whole day’s march. If the recovery had\r\nnot been such a speedy one, says Krantz, how could all the wagons have\r\nbeen secured in that part of the country devastated by war for the\r\ntransportation of the many hundreds of sick.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the sickness a vomitium of ipecacuanha and tartarus\r\nstibiatus was administered (though on the march no real medical\r\ntreatment was attempted); later on aether vitrioli with tinctura\r\nvalerianae, tinctura aromatica and finally tinctura chinae composita\r\naurantiorum with good wine, etc., were given. It is interesting to read\r\nKrantz’s statement of how much some physicians were surprised who had\r\nbeen accustomed to treat their patients in hospitals according to the\r\nprinciples of that period, which consisted in the exclusion of fresh\r\nair and the hourly administration of medicine. The mortality of those\r\ntreated on the march in the manner described was never more than 2 to 3\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, an epidemic ophthalmy spread simultaneously with\r\ntyphus among a large number of the troops returning from Courland,\r\nespecially among those who formed the rear guard, in which was the\r\nfirst East Prussian regiment to which Krantz was attached.\r\n\r\nIn a far greater proportion the men of the two Prussian cavalry\r\nregiments and artillery batteries which Napoleon had taken with him to\r\nMoscow, that is into ruin, succumbed to the morbid potencies which\r\nacted upon them from all sides.\r\n\r\nOn March 17th., 1813, York’s corps entered Berlin, and from this time\r\non contagious typhus disappeared almost completely in this army\r\ndivision. It is true that occasionally a soldier was attacked, but the\r\nnumber of these was insignificant, and the character of the sickness\r\nwas mild. Other internal diseases were also infrequent among these\r\ntroops during that time. Epidemic ophthalmy, however, was very\r\nprevalent in the East Prussian regiment of infantry. From February,\r\n1813, until the day of the battle of Leipzig, 700 men were treated for\r\nthis disease. The character of this ophthalmy was mild, and under\r\ntreatment the patients completely recovered within a few days (nine\r\ndays at most) without any destructive lesion remaining. Quite different\r\nfrom this form was a severe ophthalmy which appeared in the army toward\r\nthe end of the year 1813, and also during the years 1814 and 1815.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE SECOND CROSSING OF THE NIEMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of the enemy’s country, on their way home, the soldiers had by no\r\nmeans reached the limit of their sufferings. Instead of being able now\r\nto take the much longed for and so much needed rest they were compelled\r\nto keep on marching in order to reach the meeting places designated to\r\nthem, the principal one of which was Koenigsberg.\r\n\r\nBefore entering Prussia they had to pass through a district which was\r\ninhabited by Lithuanians who had suffered very much from the army\r\npassing on the march to Moscow, and who now took revenge on the\r\nretreating soldiers.\r\n\r\nMost happy were the Germans of the army breathing again the air of\r\ntheir native country, and they could not restrain their feelings when\r\nthey found themselves in clean dwellings.\r\n\r\nTheir first occupation was to restore themselves in regard to\r\ncleanliness, to free their faces from a thick covering of dirt\r\nintensified by smoke which could be compared with a mask. All these\r\nunfortunate men wore this mask, but, as they said while in Moscow,\r\nwithout any desire to dance. Especially the better educated ones among\r\nthem felt ashamed to present themselves in this condition in which they\r\nhad dragged themselves through Russia and Poland.\r\n\r\nOn December 16th, von Borcke and his General, von Ochs, came to\r\nSchirwind, for the first time again in a Prussian city. Quarters were\r\nassigned to them in one of the best houses, the house of the widow of a\r\nPrussian officer. The lady, on seeing the two entering the house, was\r\nastonished to learn that they were a general with his adjutant, and\r\nthat they should be her guests. Nothing about them indicated their\r\nrank, they were wrapped in sheepskins and rags full of dirt, blackened\r\nby the smoke from the camp fires, with long beards, frozen hands and\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nOn January 2nd., 1813, these two officers arrived at Thorn. They\r\nconsidered themselves saved from the great catastrophe, when there,\r\nlike in all places to which the wrecks of the grand army had come,\r\ntyphus broke out. General von Ochs was stricken down with this disease,\r\nand his condition did not warrant any hopes for recovery. His son,\r\nhowever, who had gone through the whole retreat wounded and sick with\r\ntyphus, whom the general and his adjutant had brought from Borodino in\r\na wagon under incredible difficulties, had recovered and was able to\r\nnurse his father.\r\n\r\nAnd General von Ochs came home with his Adjutant, von Borcke, on\r\nFebruary 20th., 1813.\r\n\r\nGood people took pains to give their guests an opportunity to clean\r\nthemselves thoroughly; the well-to-do had their servants attend to this\r\nprocess; in houses of the working class man and wife would give a\r\nhelping hand.\r\n\r\nSergeant Schoebel, together with a comrade, was quartered in the house\r\nof an honest tailor who, seeing how the soldiers were covered with\r\nlice, made them undress and, while the wife boiled the undergarments,\r\nthe tailor ironed the outer clothing with a hot iron.\r\n\r\nGenerous people tried to ameliorate in every manner possible the need\r\nwhich presented itself in such a pitiful form.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Schauroth was sitting in despair at a table in an inn when\r\none nobleman pressed a double Louisd’or into his hand and another\r\nplaced his sleigh at the lieutenant’s disposal to continue his journey.\r\n\r\nIn Tapiau a carpenter’s helper, himself a very poor man, begged among\r\nhis friends to obtain a suit of clothes for Sergeant Steinmueller, whom\r\nhe had never known before.\r\n\r\nBut cases of this kind were the exception; in general the Prussian\r\npeasants remembered the many excesses which, notwithstanding Napoleon’s\r\nstrict orders, the soldiers had committed on their march through East\r\nPrussia; they remembered the requisitions, they felt the plight of\r\nPrussia since the battle of Jena, and they revenged themselves on the\r\nFrench especially, but even the Germans of Napoleon’s soldiers had to\r\nsuffer from the infuriated, pitiless peasantry. Holzhausen describes\r\nscenes which were not less atrocious than those enacted by Russian\r\npeasants.\r\n\r\nAnd those who were treated kindly had the most serious difficulties:\r\nthe sudden change from misery to regular life caused many serious\r\ndisorders of the organs of digestion, ennervation and circulation. All\r\nwho have been in the field during our civil war know how long it took\r\nbefore they were able again to sleep in a bed. The Napoleonic soldiery\r\ndescribe how the warmth of the bed brought on the most frightful mental\r\npictures; they saw burnt, frozen, and mutilated comrades and had to try\r\nto find rest on the floor, their nervous and their circulatory systems\r\nwere excited to an intolerable degree. After eating they vomited, and\r\nonly gradually the ruined stomach became accustomed again, first, to\r\nthin soups and, later on, to a more substantial diet.\r\n\r\nHow much they had suffered manifested itself in many ways after the\r\nthick crust had been removed from their body and, above all, after what\r\nhad taken the place of shoes had been taken off. When Sergeant Toenges\r\nremoved the rags from his feet the flesh of both big toes came off.\r\nCaptain Gravenreuth’s boots had been penetrated by matter and ichor.\r\nPainful operations had to be performed to separate gangraenous parts.\r\nIn Marienwerder Hochberg found all the attendants of Marshal Victor on\r\nthe floor while a surgeon was amputating their limbs.\r\n\r\nBut these were comparatively minor affairs, amputated limbs played no\r\nroll when hundreds of thousands of mutilated corpses rested on the\r\nfields of Russia.\r\n\r\nAn enemy more vicious than the one that had decimated the beautiful\r\narmy was lying in wait for the last remainder which tried to rally\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt was the typhus that on the road from Moscow all through Germany and\r\nthrough France did its destructive work.\r\n\r\nThis disease had been observed, as Dr. Geissler reports, first in\r\nMoscow, ravaged most terribly in Wilna and held a second great harvest\r\nin Koenigsberg, where the first troops arrived on December 20th.\r\n\r\nOne-half of those who had been attacked succumbed, although the\r\nhospitals of Koenigsberg were ideal ones compared with those of Wilna.\r\n\r\nGeissler and his colleague had to work beyond description to ameliorate\r\nand to console; help was impossible in the majority of cases.\r\n\r\nThe physicians of Koenigsberg were not as lucky as Dr. Krantz, whose\r\npatients were in the open air instead of being confined in a hospital.\r\n\r\nIt is heartrending to read how so many who had withstood so much,\r\nescaped so many dangers, had to die now. One of these was General Eblé,\r\nthe hero of the Beresina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUPRE, MORICHEAU.

ACHILLES ROSE.\r\n\r\nAtonia Gastrica, by which term is understood abdominal relaxation and\r\nptosis of viscera, is a subject of vast importance, as has been proved\r\nby the avalanche of literature it has caused during the last decade.\r\nThe relation of some ailments to abdominal relaxation has only been\r\nrecognized since the author’s method of abdominal strapping has been\r\nadopted and extensively practiced. This book gives in attractive form\r\nall we know in regard to aetiology; it describes and treats on the\r\nsignificance of the plaster strapping as the most rational therapeutic\r\nmeasure. The illustrations given with the description will prove of\r\nmuch practical value to those who wish to give the method a trial, but\r\nwho have not had the opportunity to see the Rose belt applied.\r\n\r\n12mo.

The campaign which you have carried on\r\nhas awakened a general and widespread interest in the matter, and is\r\nbound to accomplish great good. I have read with much interest your\r\ncorrespondence with the Academy of Medicine. It shows an admirable\r\npersistent enthusiasm on one hand and a successful postponing diplomacy\r\non the other.”\r\n\r\n“For the work done by you, your name will be praised by generations.”\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the onomatology question in medicine as it\r\nstands at present one has to read this book.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN GREECE AND LIVING GREEK.

I think you laugh Erasmus out of court. Now I must begin, if\r\nleisure be ever afforded me, to dip into Greek again, to learn to\r\npronounce your noble language correctly. Congratulating you on your\r\nsuccess, and with best wishes, I am, dear Doctor,\r\n\r\n  “Very faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n“M. A. CORRIGAN, ARCHBISHOP.”\r\n\r\nDR. ACHILLES ROSE.\r\n\r\nS. STANHOPE ORRIS, Professor of Greek in Princeton University, who was\r\nDirector of the American School at Athens from 1888 to 1889, who kindly\r\nrevised the manuscript, wrote:\r\n\r\n“I think that the impression which the manuscript has made on my mind\r\nwill be made on the minds of all who read your book—that it is the\r\nproduction of an able, laborious, enthusiastic, scholarly man, who\r\ndeserves the gratitude and admiration of all who labor to perpetuate an\r\ninterest in the language, literature, and history of Greece.”\r\n\r\nAgain, after having received the book, the same Philhellene writes to\r\nthe author: “Professor Cameron, my colleague, who has glanced at the\r\nbook, pronounces it eloquent, as I also do, and unites with me in\r\nordering a copy for our University Library.”\r\n\r\nHON. EBEN ALEXANDER, former United States Minister to Greece, Professor\r\nof Greek, North Carolina University: “My dear Dr. Rose, The five copies\r\nhave been received, and I enclose check in payment…. I am greatly\r\npleased with the book. It shows everywhere the fruit of your\r\nfar-reaching studies, and your own enthusiastic interest has enabled\r\nyou to state the facts in a strongly interesting way. I hope that it\r\nwill meet with favor. I wonder whether you have sent a copy to the\r\nKing? He would like to see it, I know…. I am sincerely your friend.”\r\n\r\nWILLIAM F. SWAHLER, Professor of Greek, De Pauw University,\r\nGreencastle, Ind., writes: “I received the book today in fine order,\r\nand am much pleased so far as I have had time to peruse the same.”\r\n\r\nTHOMAS CARTER, Professor of Greek and Latin, Centenary College,\r\nJackson, La., writes: “Am highly delighted with Dr. Rose’s work; have\r\nnot had the time to read it all yet, but from what I have been able to\r\nget over, am more than ever convinced of his accurate learning, his\r\nprofound scholarship, and his devoted enthusiasm for his beloved\r\nHellas.”\r\n\r\nA. V. WILLIAMS JACKSON, Professor of Oriental Languages, Columbia\r\nUniversity, New York: “The welcome volume arrived this morning and is\r\ncordially appreciated. This note is to express my thanks and to extend\r\nbest wishes for continued success.”\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN C. PALMARIS, of Chicago: “[Greek: Eugnomonon Eggaen]. Dr.\r\nAchilles Rose. Dear Sir, Allow me to express my thanks from the bottom\r\nof my heart as a Greek for your sincere love for my beloved country\r\n‘Hellas,’ and to congratulate you for your noble philological and\r\nprecious work, ‘Christian Greece and Living Greek,’ with the true\r\nGnomikon. ‘It is shameful to defame Greece continually.’ I received\r\nto-day the three copies for me and one for my brother-in-law (Prince\r\nRodokanakis), which I despatched immediately to Syra.”\r\n\r\nDR. A. F. CURRIER, New York: “Dear Dr. Rose, I received your book with\r\ngreat pleasure. It is very attractively made up, and I am looking\r\nforward to the pleasure of reading it. As I get older I am astonished\r\nat the charm with which memory recalls history, myth, and poetry in the\r\nstudy of the classics long ago. With sincerest wishes for your success,\r\nbelieve me yours, Philhellenically.”\r\n\r\nC. EVERETT CONANT, Professor of Greek and Latin, Lincoln University,\r\nLincoln, III.: “I wish personally to thank you for the effort you are\r\nmaking to set before us Americans the true status of the modern Greek\r\nlanguage in its relation with the classic speech of Pericles’ day. With\r\nbest wishes for the success of your laudable undertaking, I am\r\ncordially yours.”\r\n\r\nMR. H. E. S. SLAGENHAUP, Taneytown, Md.: “Dr. Achilles Rose. Dear Sir,\r\nYour book, ‘Christian Greece and Living Greek,’ reached me this\r\nmorning. Although it arrived only this morning I have already read the\r\ngreater part of it. It is a work for which every Philhellene must feel\r\ntruly grateful to you. Not only do I admire the care, the industry, and\r\nthe scholarly research which are evident on every page of this valuable\r\nexposition of Hellenism and Philhellenism, but I most heartily indorse\r\nevery sentiment expressed in it. I rejoice that such a book has\r\nappeared; I hope it may have a wide influence favorable to the just\r\ncause of Hellas; and I pledge myself to render whatever assistance may\r\nlie in my power in the furtherance of that cause. The disasters of the\r\npast year have in no wise shaken my faith in the Hellenic race; on the\r\ncontrary, they have increased my admiration for the brave people who\r\nundertook a war against such odds in behalf of their oppressed\r\nbrethren; and I believe that the cause which sustained such regrettable\r\ndefeats on the plains of Thessaly last year will eventually triumph in\r\nspite of opposition.”\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN B. STEPHENSON, M. D., Surgeon United States Navy. “United\r\nStates Marine Corps Recruiting Office, Boston: My dear Doctor, Permit\r\nme to write you of my pleasure and satisfaction in reading your\r\nexcellent book on Christian Greece and Greek; and to express my\r\nappreciation of the clear and vivid manner in which you have portrayed\r\nthe life and work of the Hellenes, who have done so much in preserving\r\nand transmitting to us the learning in science and art of the ancient\r\nworld…. Your reference to the eminent professor of Greek who said that\r\nthere was ‘no literature in modern Greek worthy of the name,’ reminds\r\nme of the remark of a man, prominent in financial and social circles,\r\nwho told me that there was nothing in Russian to make it worth while\r\nstudying the language [Dr. Stephenson is a well-known\r\nlinguist—mastering eight languages, Russian among them]. I wish you all\r\nsuccess in the work of letting the light of truth, as to Greek, shine\r\nin the minds of those who do not know their own ignorance.”\r\n\r\nMORTIMER LAMSON EARLE, Professor Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pa., who\r\nmastered so well the living Greek language that Greeks of education\r\npronounce their admiration of his elegant style, saying that it is most\r\nwonderful how well a foreigner writes their own language: “The book has\r\nbeen duly received, but I have not as yet had time to read all of it.\r\nHowever, I have read enough to know that, though I differ with you in\r\nmany details, I am heartily in accord with you in earnestly supporting\r\nthe cause of a people and language to which I am sincerely attached. I\r\nam glad that you speak so highly in praise of the Klephtic songs. I\r\nhope that your book may do much good.”\r\n\r\nLOUIS F. ANDERSON, Professor of Greek, Whitman College, Walla Walla,\r\nWash.: “From my rapid inspection I regard it as superior even to my\r\nanticipations. I trust that it will have an extensive sale and\r\ncorresponding influence. It is the book needed just now. I hope to\r\nwrite more in the future.”\r\n\r\nMR. C. MEHLTRETTER, New York: “After due reading of your book I feel it\r\nmy duty to congratulate you on same. True, you may have received so\r\nmany congratulatory notes that the layman’s opinion will be of little\r\nvalue. Nevertheless, I can assure you the perusal of your book caused\r\nme more pleasure and instruction than any other I heretofore read on\r\nthe subject. I assure you it will find a prominent place in my library,\r\nand any time in future you should again write on _any subject_ consider\r\nme one of your subscribers.”\r\n\r\nWILLIAM J. SEELYE, Professor of Greek, University of Wooster, Ohio:\r\n“Dr. Rose’s book received yesterday. I have already read enough to see\r\nthat the author is not only full of his subject, but treats it with\r\njudicial mind.”\r\n\r\nJOSEPH COLLINS, M.D., Professor Post-Graduate School of Medicine, New\r\nYork: “The chapters of your book that I have read have been\r\nentertaining and instructive.”\r\n\r\nISAAC A. PARKER, Professor of Greek and Latin, Lombard University,\r\nGalesburg, Ill.: “I wish to say to Dr. Rose that, although I have yet\r\nhad time only to glance hastily at the book, the few sentences which I\r\nhave read have interested me very much, and it will give me much\r\npleasure to give it a careful perusal, as I see that it contains much\r\nvaluable information. The thanks of those interested in Greece and\r\nGreek literature are due to Dr. Rose for giving them this book. Praise\r\nis due to the printer for his excellent work.”\r\n\r\nCHARLES R. PEPPER, Professor Central University, Richmond, Ky.: “Your\r\nbook, ‘Christian Greece and Living Greek,’ came duly to hand. I am much\r\npleased with it. I hope the interest of the Philhellenes in the United\r\nStates may be quickened to a livelier degree in Greece and Greek\r\naffairs, and that your book may accomplish a good work in putting\r\nbefore the people generally the claims of Hellas to the gratitude,\r\nlove, and admiration of the civilized world.”\r\n\r\n[_From the Troy Daily Times_, Feb. 7, 1898.]\r\n\r\n“Christian Greece and Living Greek,” by Dr. Achilles Rose. In view of\r\nthe Hellenic defeat in the war with Turkey a year ago the future of\r\nGreece to many minds is rather vague and clouded. This idea is due to\r\nlack of knowledge of Greece history and character. Were Americans more\r\nfamiliar with the character of the Hellenes and their traditions none\r\nwould doubt that the descendants of those great figures of the heroic\r\nage have a mission before them and that this mission will be\r\naccomplished in spite of Turkish bullets and the selfishness of the\r\nother European powers. Dr. Rose in this volume offers a clear\r\npresentation of the condition of Greece at the present time. His work\r\ndeals not only with the nation, but with the language, and the history\r\nof each is traced from its earliest beginnings down to the present\r\ntime. The reading of this book will afford a much clearer understanding\r\nof the causes leading to the war of 1897 than is generally possessed.\r\nOf especial interest is an introduction written by one of the best\r\nknown Greeks now resident in this country, who reviews the causes\r\nleading to the great war, and clearly shows the shamefulness of the\r\ncourse pursued by the great European powers in leaving Hellas to her\r\nfate. Some of the statements made are significant, notably the\r\nfollowing: “If Greece has sinned, it was on the side of compassion for\r\nher oppressed children and coreligionists. She is bleeding from every\r\npore of her mutilated body, but there is a Nemesis which sooner or\r\nlater will overtake those who rejoice now at her defeat and\r\nhumiliation.” New York: Peri Hellados Publishing Office.\r\n\r\nFrom REV. HENRY A. BUTTZ, Dean Theological Seminary, Madison, N.J.: “My\r\ndear Sir, I have read with interest your book ‘Christian Greece and\r\nLiving Greek,’ and have found it full of valuable suggestion. It\r\ndiscusses many points of great interest, giving a more correct view of\r\nthe true condition of the Greece of to-day and of its relation to its\r\nglorious past. I am especially pleased with your forcible putting of\r\nthe importance of adopting the modern Greek pronunciation in our study\r\nof the Greek language. I wish your book a wide circulation.”\r\n\r\nF. A. PACKARD, M.D., Kearney, Neb.: “Dear Sir and Doctor, Your book on\r\n‘Christian Greece and Living Greek’ received. I must say it is a grand\r\nwork and I prize it highly and consider it a valuable addition to my\r\nlibrary. Wishing you success, etc.”\r\n\r\nA. JACOBI, M.D., Professor Columbia University: “Dear Dr. Rose, The\r\nperusal of your book has been a source of much pleasure to me. If\r\nHellas has as enthusiastic men and women among her own people as you\r\nare, a friend in a foreign nation, she will have a promising future.”\r\n\r\nMR. LOUIS PRANG, Boston, Mass.: “‘Christian Greece and Living Greek’\r\nhas given me not only great pleasure to read but I have learned more\r\nabout Greece, as it was and as it _really_ is, than I ever knew before.\r\nYour book is exceedingly valuable to a man like me who desires\r\n_reliable_ information on this very interesting people and who lacks\r\nthe time for personal investigation or much book-reading, which after\r\nall, to judge by your statements, would not lead to a correct\r\nappreciation of present conditions. Your personal experience based on\r\nlarge and varied observations among the people, and your evidently\r\nthorough study of past history make your judgment acceptable, and your\r\nmanner of giving it to the reader is eminently interesting and\r\nengaging, and above all convincing. I do not think that what I have\r\nsaid here will be of much interest or satisfaction to you, as coming\r\nfrom a simple business man, but I wished to thank you for the enjoyment\r\nyour book has given me and to tell you that you have made at least one\r\nconvert for the cause of living Greek.”\r\n\r\nA GREEK LADY, living in Cairo, Egypt, writes to her father: “I thank\r\nyou above all for the book of Dr. Rose you were so kind as to send me,\r\nand which I am perusing with the greatest interest. One can see that\r\nDr. Rose is a friend of our dear country; if there were more like him\r\nwe would not be so run down by ignorant and spiteful people.”\r\n\r\n[_From New York Medical Journal_, March 5th, 1898.]\r\n\r\nDr. Rose’s well-known enthusiasm for the Greeks, their country, and\r\nparticularly their language has resulted in the production of a very\r\ninteresting book. Physicians will naturally be most interested in the\r\nconcluding chapter, which treats of Greek as the international language\r\nof physicians and scholars in general, but from cover to cover there is\r\nnothing commonplace in the book; it is quite readable throughout. We\r\ncongratulate Dr. Rose on the appearance of the volume in so attractive\r\na form.\r\n\r\n[_From The Independant_, March 24th, 1898.]\r\n\r\nDr. Rose stands forth in his volume the champion of modern Greece, the\r\nGreeks and their wrongs. He tells the story as it has been developed in\r\nthis century, and recites the older history and appeals to the\r\nintelligent Christian world against the Great Assassin of\r\nConstantinople. He believes the modern Greek tongue as now spoken and\r\nwritten to be the ideal one for international intercourse, especially\r\non scientific matters, and repudiates the Erasmian method of\r\npronunciation. His account of the Greeks themselves is encouraging. He\r\nclaims for them a strict morality. Theft he declares unknown, and\r\ndrunkenness. The book is certainly eloquent and inspiring.\r\n\r\n[_From The Living Church_, Chicago, March 19th, 1898.]\r\n\r\nThis is a most interesting book. There is not a dull page in it. It is\r\nmade up of various lectures delivered by the accomplished author, at\r\ndifferent times, on the Greek language and history. Magnificent as\r\nGibbon’s work is on the Byzantine Empire, the contemptuous tone he uses\r\ntoward it has much misled modern writers and readers in their\r\nestimation of that wonderful monarchy. A state which lasted as that did\r\nin the face of so many difficulties, could not have been so badly\r\ngoverned as Gibbon implies. That Dr. Rose shows, and a good, English,\r\nup-to-date Byzantine history is greatly to be desired. Dr. Rose’s\r\naccount of the Greek struggle for independence is vivid, patriotic, and\r\nfull of information on a subject that few people know much about. The\r\nmost interesting part of the book to scholars is the chapters on modern\r\nGreek. Dr. Rose says: “The living Greek of to-day shows much less\r\ndeviation from the Greek of two thousand and more years ago than any\r\nother European language shows in the course of centuries.” This\r\nstatement will surprise many, but it is literally true. Dr. Rose gives\r\nthe history of the creation of the modern Greek literary language on\r\nthe lines of classic Greek, and he advocates the use of modern Greek,\r\nespecially in the matter of pronunciation, in teaching classic Greek.\r\nIn all this we go with him heartily, and his views are being adopted in\r\nmany colleges in Europe and America.\r\n\r\n[_From the Evangelist_, February 17th, 1898.]\r\n\r\nWe commend this book to all who would know what the “concert of\r\nEuropean powers” means to a struggling kingdom and people used as a\r\n“buffer state” between the unspeakable Turk and civilized “Westerns.”\r\nThe historical chapters of the work are a revelation of the intricacies\r\nof “the disgraceful deals of the great powers whose victim the kingdom\r\nof Greece has been.” The story is simply told with great candor and\r\nquiet reserve, but it carries a lesson that moves the heart and stirs\r\nthe indignation of dispassionate and perhaps indifferent observers. How\r\nhard is it for a people like the Greeks or the Armenians to get a\r\nhearing! What “political necessities” demand silence; what diplomatic\r\nfalsehoods, deceptions, subterfuges are indulged by ministries and\r\ncabinets that are called Christian! The history of Greece from the fall\r\nof the Byzantine Empire up to this hour is a tragedy, and the final\r\ndeliverance in 1828 was more painfully sad and disappointing, more\r\nshamefully mismanaged and limited, more wretchedly hampered and\r\nhindered in every possible way, than is easily conceivable, considering\r\nthe popular sentiment roused by such Philhellenes as Byron, Erskine,\r\nGladstone, and the Genevan banker Eynard. Think of the massacre of\r\nChios, and then hear men talking of Navarino as a blunder!\r\n\r\nBut let our readers turn to the pages of Dr. Rose’s book for\r\ninformation. There is a historical sketch of the Byzantine Empire,\r\nshowing the most extraordinary misrepresentations which have held on\r\ntill very recently; a second chapter exposes the “erroneous views which\r\nhave prevailed in regard to the relation of the Greek of to-day to the\r\nGreek of the classical period,” with a chapter on “absurd ideas in\r\nvogue in regard to Greek pronunciation”; a fourth chapter gives the\r\nmisery of the Turkish bondage and “their spiritual and political\r\nresurrection”; then follows one on the wrongs to the Greeks in their\r\nstruggle for liberty, in which some American shipping firms are\r\ninvolved and “Mr. W. J. Stillman” is pretty severely handled; then “the\r\nkingdom of Greece before the war of 1897,” and an “Epilogue,” which\r\nshould be read before Dr. Hepworth has time to get in his Armenian\r\ndiscoveries. This is the merest hint as to the intrinsic interest and\r\npertinency of the book, the only unprejudiced and patriotic plea for\r\nthe Greeks which has escaped the censorship of the press and politics\r\nand politicians. Let the Greeks be heard! Let the list of Philhellenes\r\ngrow to a grand majority in Europe and America that shall make itself\r\nheard in behalf of justice and humanity!\r\n\r\nThe scholarly chapters are as admirable as the statesmanlike and\r\npatriotic ones. They should lead to a Greek revival. We think the\r\nuniversity wars of “Greeks and Trojans” might be fought over again. We\r\njoin the Greeks!\r\n\r\nHis EXCELLENCY KLÉON RANGABÉ, Greek Ambassador in Berlin, writes: “Many\r\nsincere thanks for the kind transmission of your most interesting\r\nbook…. I can congratulate you most sincerely. You treat all the\r\nimportant subjects in so exhaustive and conclusive a manner that all\r\nthose who seek for truth must necessarily be convinced. We are in\r\nconsequence indebted to you for a valuable service, but your own\r\nAmerican countrymen ought also to be thankful to you, for every apostle\r\nof truth is in his way a benefactor of humanity. I hope that the days\r\nof the Erasmian absurdity, which belongs to the Dark Ages and is\r\nunworthy of American scholars, are now numbered. I hope that your book\r\nwill also appear in German as it would do a great deal of good here.\r\nWhat you say about the system applied to Greek studies in general is\r\nalso perfectly correct. These studies are still and will always be the\r\nsoul of every liberal education, and, constantly undermined by the\r\nmaterialistic tendencies of the age, they can only be saved through a\r\nfundamental change of this system. The language must henceforth be\r\ntaught as a living one, having never ceased to live for a moment since\r\nthe days of Homer.”\r\n\r\n_Neologos_, an Athenian paper, writes a long article, reviewing the\r\nbook and its author’s works in general. “The author’s name is already\r\nknown to us by his lectures on Greece which have been published here.\r\nMr. Rose belongs to those who will persevere to establish an idea;\r\nobstacles and difficulties can only serve to such characters to spur\r\ntheir ardor. Mr. Rose is inspired by the noble idea to disseminate a\r\nbetter knowledge of Greece of to-day and to enlist sympathies in her\r\nbehalf. He is combating the influence of an impossible Grecophobe\r\npress. People abroad will change their opinion when they know our true\r\nhistory, our character, our morals, customs, etc.”\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLISHER OF THIS JOURNAL HAS PUBLISHED A GREEK TRANSLATION OF THE\r\nBOOK.\r\n\r\nOther Athenian political and literary journals bring likewise reviews.\r\nAll are full of praise of the author and his book. The editor of the\r\njournal, _Salpinx_, of Cyprus, writes that the author’s name is\r\nengraved in the hearts determination of Greeks.\r\n\r\nD. B. ST. JOHN ROOSA, M.D., President Post-Graduate Medical School and\r\nHospital, New York: “My dear Dr. Rose, The copy of the important work\r\nwritten by you, which has just been published, came to me two days ago.\r\nI write to thank you, and again to express my sincere interest in your\r\nbook. I hope you may live to see it successful. A common language for\r\nscientific men is indeed a great need. Yours ever faithfully.”\r\n\r\nB. T. SPENCER, A.M., Professor of Greek, Kentucky Wesleyan College: “I\r\nam deeply interested in the subject and feel that that interest has\r\nbeen intensified by reading Dr. Rose’s book. All the friends of Hellas\r\nshould read it.”\r\n\r\nDR. JAMES T. WHITTAKER, Cincinnati, Ohio: “I am enjoying your book very\r\nmuch and have just finished the chapter concerning the Greeks under\r\nTurkish bondage, which is the most interesting description of this\r\nsubject which I have ever seen.”\r\n\r\nKNUT HOEGH, M.D., Minneapolis, Minn.: “Your book came one mail after\r\nyour letter; I went to a medical meeting in the evening; during my\r\nabsence my oldest daughter read the book, and on my return, when I\r\nopened the door, she told me how well she liked it. I had to sit down\r\nand read it, and I did so until far out in the small hours. I must say\r\nthat the book opened new views to me, and I am sorry that I did not\r\nknow the many valuable facts contained in it when I was in Berlin last\r\nyear, when you know the wind that was blowing was anything but\r\nPhilhellenic. What a forcible argument against the prevailing order of\r\nthings in Europe is the whole Eastern question!”\r\n\r\nA German translation under the title: Die Griechen und ihre Sprache\r\nseit der Zeit Konstantin’s des Grossen, has been published in Leipzig\r\nVerlag von Wilhelm Friedrich, 1899.",
